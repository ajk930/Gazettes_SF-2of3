CHINA'S PROBABLE APPEAL.

"WASHINGTON, March 12.â There: is
reason to believe that China has appealed
to the United States in her extremity, but
whether the appeal Is broader and vis to
other nations as well it is not possible to
learn at present. Nothing has been heard
from Russia since the verbal communica
tion made , by Count Cassinl last week
setting forth the rectitude of Russia's ob
jects in China generally and in Manchu
ria in particular. Minister Wu has been
almost a dally caller at the State Depart

has been reached and that the destiny of
Manchuria depends upon the Immediate
action of the powers. : 'Â¦..-.

WHOSE FAILING HEALTH CAUSES ALARM AND FREQUENT PRE
DICTIONS THAT HIS DEATH IS DRAWING NEAR. :
Shortly after 11 o'clock to-night XJ. S.
Miller, who was Attorney General in
President Harrison's Cabinet, telephoned
from the Harrison home to his law part
ner, John B. Elam. that death was liable
to come, at once to the house. The two
will remain at the Harrison bedside all
night. 2M
The next day it was announced to the
papers and to the public that the illness
was more alarming than was at first sup
posed and that thero was danger that the
general would never recover 'from the at
tack. Since Monday morning his condi
tion has gradually grown worse.
Thursday morning he awakened with a
pain In his chest, which at first was hard
ly, noticeable, but later gradually grew
worse, until Mrs. Harrison became
alarmed and the .'amity physician. Dr.
Henry Jamieson. was summoned. He pro
nounced it simply a cold, and at the time
feared no alarming results.
'' Then the lungs became rapidly affected
and the illness was complicated with in
tercostal neuralgia. Saturday his condition
was serious, but not ruch as to cause par
ticular alarm. Sunday for the first time
the physicians began to have fears for the
recovery of the patient, but said little to
the. public about the seriousness of Gen
eral Harrison's condition.

News Comes as a Shock.
The news to-day that there seemed to
be little- if any hope for recovery came as
a shock to the neighbors and friends of
the general, although they knew he was
a very sick man. They recalled that it
was less than a week since they had seen
his familiar form In the street. They
seldom saw him in street cars, for he
never rode in good weather. Twice, and
sometimes of tener, a day. he walked from
his home downtown and back, and of
evenings he liked nothing. better than to
hunt up a friend and stroll over the
northern part of the city.
The sudden illness of the general re
called to the public that he had been seen
in public more this winter, than for many
years, and it was remembered, too, that
he* never before appeared so willing to
discuss subjects of general Interest. On
New Year's; day he made a. notable ad
dress at the dedication of the Columbia
Club .building, and fiince that time has
been conspicuously in the public mind by
reason of 'things, he lias been saying In a
series of articles in the North American
Review. / . Â¦
/'General Harrison was In perfect health'
last Wednesday -and, contrary to common
report, r .was not - suffering from a cold or.
f roni illness of any sort. He was in full
possession of the vitality and vigor' which
has characterized these later years of his
life ; to/ a remarkable ' extent.

The widespread Interest In the; former
President is shown by ,'the " hundreds of
messages from all parts of the country
which poured- into the newspaper offices
and the [Harrison -homo during the day.
There was not a State or Territory that
did not make Inquiry by wire, and many
were the ) expressions . hoping that there
might be a turn for the better. Among
the many telegrams of Inquiry received
to-day by Private Secretary Tibbetts was
the. following from the White House:
"WASHINGTON. /March 12.â Will you
be good enough to -advise me of General
Harrison's condition? The President Is
very much pained to learn by the latest
reports of the serious character' of the
general's illness.
"GEORGE T. CORTEL.TOU, Sec."
Numerous similar messages have been
received. â¢' All the members of General
Harrison's Cabinet have telegraphed.
D.'M. Ramsdall. 3crgcant-at-arms of the
Senate, left 'Washington for Indianapolis
to-day when he learned* of the serious
condition of General Harrison. The peo
ple of Indianapolis who have known the
general .so long were not less eager for
news from the -bedside than were other
citizens of other cities and other. States,
and the newspaper .offices were busy all

Shortly after 10 o'clock to-night, with
his face plainly betraying his agitation.
Dr. Jamieson, the physician In charge,
left the residence of General Harrison to
go to, his office to prepare some addi
tional medicines which the gravity of the
case demanded. When he returned he
said that the condition of General Har
rison ; was . extremely critical and that It
was impossible ; to say. how long in nU
weakened condition the patient might be
enabled to resist the deepening of the con
gestion. >
Early to-night there was increased
respiration, which told of the creeping
congestion, and the strength of General
Harrison began to diminish rapidly. At
10 o'clock he was f mucn weaker than he
had been two hours before, and from that
time on the sinking rap.'dly continued.
General Harrison continued to sink from
early this morning. He was for the great
er part of the time in a semi-comatose
condition, and thera were symptoms of
approaching delirium. The signal spread-
Ing and deepening of the inflammation
and congestion were the cause of the great
danger that had been feared from the be
ginning of his illness.
At 5 o'clock this afternoon it becam9
apparent that General Harrison was dy
ing, and the physicians at the bedside of
the distinguished patient made no effort
to conceal the real gravity of the situa
tion. They say. that it Is a matter of
hours only, and all hope cf his recovery
has been abandoned. .
At 2 o'clock this afternoon Dr. Jamieson
declared in his bulletin that General Har
rison's condition was critical. , At 3
o'clock and 4 o'clock additional bulletins
were Issued which simply stated that no
change in the condition of the general had
occurred from earlier in the afternoon.
Drs. Jamieson, Hadley and Dorsey
watched by the bedside, not leaving it
for a moment except to retire for a short,
low-voiced consultation in a corner or
In an adjoining room. Mrs. Harrison still
waited for the most minute symptoms of
favor.
Condition Is Critical.
When the general was taken ill, it is
said, he requested his physicians to make
no unnecessarily alarming statement ; to
the public as to his condition. As .the
physicians have decided to heed this'.re
quest It has been with the greatest diffi
culty that any authentic news has been
obtained from the sick room up to within
the last twenty-four hours. When an in
quiry is made on the telephone as to the
general's condition, the inquirer is
promptly referred to Dr. Jamieson. The
latter is now issuing hourly bulletins to
the press.

Chinese Driven From Apparently
Impregnable Position.
LONDON. March 12.â The Peking cor
respondent of the Morning Post, wiring
Saturday and giving details of the storm-
Ing cf a gate of the great wall by Colonel
Ledeburs* column, March 8. says:
"The Germans captured the Chung
ehun pass between the provinces of Chili
and Ehansl after several hours' fighting.
The result was brilliantly achieved by the
Bavarian battalion, which marched 123
miles from PaoUngfu In four days,
through mountains and over difficult xnulo
tracks.
"The Chinese held an apparently Im
pregnable position on the wall at the
highest point of thÂ« pass. They had sev
eral hundred troops and artillery of every
description- The Germans attacked them
with GOO Infantry and two howitzers. The
turning movement, over an almost im
passable country, occupied seven hours
and was completely successful. The Chi
nesÂ© fled Into the- province of Shansl,
leaving at least one bundred dead and
four Hotchkiss guns. The victory will
bwe en excellent moral effect, as the
STORMING OF THE GATE.
BERLIN'. March 12â The War Office has
received the following dispatch from
Count von Waldereee:
"PEKING, March 11.â In the fight west
of SuHng: Pass we had only one slightly
wounded. The Chinese left 230 dead on the
fi*>:d. Our cavalry, with four quick-firers,
pursued the Chinese twenty miles. A bat
talion remains at Fcnplng and westward
fr<->m the great wall to prevent a return
of thf Chinese troons."
Official circles in Berlin declare that it
!? impossible to judge here exactly what
leads to the Chinese activity around the
pi-cat wall. Russian papers are spreading
reports that the movement there is engi
neered by General Tung Fun Slang and
Prince Tuan for the reconquest of Man
churia. It is to the interest of Russia to
circulate this view, On the other hand it
la believed In Berlin that the Chinese
troops near the great wall have but slight
power of resistance, as the reports of
Colonel Ledebur's engagement peems to
indicate. It is also believed that these
Chinese troops are inferior to those sent
against the allies before the capture of
Peking.
The statement that Russia Insists upon
China's signature to the Manchurian con
vention rests upon China's authority, but
Germany has no reason to suppress such
Information and the fact remains that the
agreement has not been signed as yet.
Nothing Is known as to the published re
port that German capitalists axe negotiat
ing with high Chinese officials for the
erection of arsenals at Nanking. Wo

LONDON, March 13, 4:30 a. m.â Friction
has arisen at Tientsin between the Brit

alleged to belong to the railway company
End to have been in possession of the
company for some years.
According to dispatches from Tientsin
the Russians assert that this land Is part
of their new concessions, and, therefore,
Kussian* property. Mr. Kinder, manager
of the railway, began to make a. siding.
but was stopped by the Russian authori
ties. He appealed to Colonel MacDonald,
â¢who referred the matter to General Bar
row, British chief of EtoftT in Peking, who
replied: "Carry on the siding with armed
force if necessary."
Guards were put on the line by the
British and the -work continued.
General Wagasak. the Russian com
mander, protested and said the thing
Â¦would net have ben done if the Russians
had had as many troops as the British,
adding that such matters should be left
to diplomacy.
Colonel MacDonaJd again communicated
Â¦with General Barrow, who replied "Con
tinue the siding."
General Wagasak appealed to the Rus-
Fian Minister at Peking; M. de Giers.
Count von "Waldersee has Informed
General Chaffee that the troops under his
command will be disposed of as follows
during: the summer months: England

tains west of the city. Italy will draw the
troops from that part of the summer pal

General Colville's friends contended

Mr. Balfour, the Government leader, ob

fused assistance, taking the position
that as long as Captain Jensen had put
up bonds there was no reason why they
should take the Chinese into custody.
Finally Thornton got British Consul Jelly
and an interpreter out on the barge with
the Chinese. The conference committee
reported in favor of a peaceful return to
the bark Collingrove, provided Thornton
went along and remained over night to
preserve peace ,in the ship's family.
Thornton agreed. Now all is quiet aboard
the Collingrove and Captain Jensen's
$2400 Is safe. , . .
SEATTLE, March 12.â With only an un
loaded, pistol Y. M. Thornton, formerly
chief engineer of the steamer Sarah M.
Bentcn. held up and captured, fourteen
Chinese, constituting the entire crevr, of
the British bark Collingrove, who were
escaping in a small boat. The Collin
grovo.arrived at Port Blakeley on Satur
day from S/ianghai, and Captain Jensen
prepared to enjoy a period of calm after
a long, deep-water voyage. On Monday,
morning, when he got ready to order up
his breakfast, he found the bark desert
ed by every one of the fourteen Mongo
lians. The situation was alarming, espe
cially to the captain, who saw the $2100
bond he had put up at Port Tpwnsend
with the Collector of the Port for the re
turn of the Chinese to the Orient disap
pearing in Uncle Sam's capacious pocket.
Captain Jensen boarded the steamer
Siirah M. Kenton for Seattle. A fast pas
sage was made, and a few minutes after
landing the captain had engaged the as
sistance of H. M. Thornton.- The steamer
Estella - was chartered, and Thornton,
armed with an empty pistol, went forth
on the waters of Puget Sound to capture
the Chinese and save Captain Jensen's
*2400.
Luck had it that the Chinese were dis
covered in a small boat near Alki Point.
As soon as they saw that the steamer was
after them they made haste to reach
shore, but were retarded by the crowded
condition cf their boat. Before they could
land Thornton had them dancing to the
tune ot an empty pistol. After their cap
ture the Chinese became quiet and made
no objection to being quarantined on one
of the city barges.

acroas the continent and I'll fight you to
the bitter end. I'll send you where you

Nobody moved.. In a moment she re
opened the door and said more forcibly:
"Mrs. Springfield, you will please get
out of my yard. 1 don't want you here."
"Oh, Frankle, Frankie!" exclaimed the
aunt, bursting into tears. "I didn't think
you would treat your poor old aunt like
this. To think that I, who raised you,
should be ordered out of your yard. Oh,
Frankle, Frankle!" "â¢
The door closed again. Mr. Springfield
came upon the scene, but refused to talk,
referring Attorney Murphy to his law
year, J. A. Louttit of Stockton. He would
not come near hla wife nor even look in
her direction, saying afterward that he
feared she had a revolver or a bottle of

them were asleep when the train stopped
at Arlington Heights to take on two ear*

St. Paul crashed into the stock train ca

The crash aroused the village, and the

the rescue and extinguished the flamo*

was discussing Achi'a lesolutlon for a me

Senate's Quarter* Poor.
Nothing of great Importance has taken
place In the Hawaiian Legislature since
last report. The legislative department
has taken another fall out of the execu
tive department, but the incident has
caused scarcely a ripple. This was con
nected with suitable accommodations for
the Senate. â¢ - _
In preparing for the session the Gov
ernment repeated the arrangements of
sessions of the Legislature of the repub
lic of Hawaii. Before that came Into ex
istence the legislative hall of the mon
archy had been transformed by the Pro
vlstonal Government -Into military bar
racks.
Under the republic the House of Rep
resentatives occupied the old throneroom,
of the Iolanl Palace, changed to the Ex
ecutive Building In name. This is a cham
ber fit for any legislative body In the
world as to style and dignity.
The Senate, though supposed to be the
superior body, was planted in the main
upstairs hallway of the palace. Its walls
were low screens of papfer macho similar
to what Is seen In winerooms. The corral
lay right In the tracks leading to the of
fices of tho President, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Attorney General and Auditor
General. There was no exclusion of the
sounds of people going freely about busi
ness upon that floor.
This Is the sort of quarters that Gover
nor Dole saw lit to place at the disposal
of the Senate of the first Legislature of
the Territory of Hawaii. The space
amounted to perhaps one-fourth of the
area occupied by the territorial executive
himself, with the same proportion to the
Attorney General's suite of offices, and
about one-half of the floor space the Sec
retary of the Territory has for hi3 pri
vate office alone.
There was absolutely no possibility of
the Senate holding an executive session
in even ordinary privacy, let alone strict
secrecy. Moreover, as a matter of fact,
the Senators while engaged In the public
business were frequently disturbed by
loud conveÂ»satlon outside the flimsy and
low panels, as well as occasionally re
galed with a lively whistling concert.
Ten days of this sort of accommoda
tion proved enough. The Senate appoint
ed a committee to confer with the Gover
nor with the object of obtaining a suitable
place of meeting. The best the Governor
could offer was the upper floor of King
Kalakaua's old bungalow In the yard of
the Capitol. It had been occupied for sev
eral years by the Officers' Club of the Na
tional Guard of, Hawaii. . Old and rotten,
with a crazy, narrow staircase, it was
really little of an improvement, especially
with regard to dignity, yet it was cheer
fully accepted. At all events it confers
some degree of comfort and privacy as
compared with the breezy hallway of the
This satisfactory closing of the Incident
is another evidence of the tractablllty and
the reasonablenesÂ»*-or. rather, the inborn
politeness of the Intelligent native Ha
waiian. A white majority seized with a
spark of American Independence would
have made no bones about compelling one
of the high officials to vacate his sumpt
uous apartments temporarily for the ac
commodation of the people's higher rep
resentative assembly.
Departmental Clashes.
There seems no end to the little clashes
between the Federal and Territorial au
thorities over acommodatlons. The latest
Is caused by the modest request of the
Collector of Internal Revenue, Mr. Cham
berlain, that the Government construct an
arch between the two apartments com
posing his offices. All the satisfaction he
receives is a growl from the Superintend
ent of Public Works, uttered in the Gov
ernor's semi-weekly council, that the Ter
rHory has more pressing Improvements of
its own desirable without money where

Stimulated by a letter from Secretary
Hitchcock, conveying the complaint of a
pauatter on public land at Olaa, Island of

attention of his council complaints that
had reached him directly regarding Sun
day labor on sugar plantations. The mat
ter was referred to the Attorney General
with instructions to have, the law en

Both houses of the Legislature have set

have been introduced in House and Senate
each. Many are for law amendments de
signed to reconcile the old codea to. new

HEART DISEASE. .
Borne Facts Hegarding the Eapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart trouble, at least among the Azner-
1<-arj5. is certainly increasing, nnd while
this may fco largely due to the excitement
and wciry cf Am^riran business life it is
more often tho result of weak stomachs
of po<T diRcstlon. ' f !
Ucal organic disease is incurable; but i
rot one case In a hVindred of heart trouble
Is orcanic.
The close relation between heart trouble
and poor riiffpstion is because both organs
are controlled by the same preat nerve?
th<? Sympathetic and Pneurur.pastrlc
In another way, also the heart is afTect-
pd by the form of yoor digestion which
Cftfaes sas and fermentation from half
digested food. There Is a foellnp of op-
pretsion and heaviness in the cheat caused
by prcxFure of the distended stomach on
the heart and lungs, interfcrinjr with their
cmi.ji.; hence arises palpitation and short
breath.
Poor cig-pf-tlon alfio poisons the Mood
makinp It thin an<I watery, which irritates
and weakens the heart.
â¢ The raost ??nFlble treatment for heart
trouble 's to improve the digestion and to
lrpure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be dene by the regular use
after meals of some Fafe. pleasant and ef-

MENTO, March 12.-The Senate bill cre
ating a State text book commission and
defining its powers and duties was passed
by the Assembly this morning by a vote
of aS ayes, not an opposing vote being

The bill embodies a radical change in
the present system, in placing the selec
tion of State text books directly in the
hands of two commissioners, subject,
however, to the -approval of the State
Board of Education. It further provides
for the purchase or lease of copyrights,
making It possible for the commissioners
to obtain for the State series the best
books of Eastern publishers Instead of
being compelled to have books compiled
for the series.

MENTO, March 12.â The primary law
was the subject of an hour's debate In
the Senate to-night, at the end of which
Cutter's amendment was adopted and the
bill went to third reading. The heart of
the primary law Is the test, and It was
with the test clause that the Assembly
tinkered when the bill was under consid
eration In the Lower House. The orig
inal test was that a man. when he went
to vote at a primary, should signify which
party he would support at the next gen
eral election, and he would then be given
a ballot for that party. The Assembly
amplifies this Into the Johnson test, which
required. In addition, that the would-be
voter should make oath that he believed
in the principles of the party he was es
pousing at the primary.
The Senate would not accept the As
sembly bill In that shape, and Cutter's
amendment to restore the original and
simpler test passed. The amendment, and
the bill as well, were opposed by Short

by Devlin, Sims. Davis, Wolfe and Cald

that the provision would most effectually
prevent the sale of the toothsome quall

could have more than a very limited
quantity it: his possession at one time.
The amendment was lost. So was another
similar in intent to it. There was a third
amendment striking out the provision -
which forbids the sale of quail and deer. ;
but this, too, was lost and then the bill
went to third reading.
As it stands now the man who wants to
have a quail for dinner must go out ani
shoot it. It was claimed this measure
was for the purpose of protecting quail

Cowan made a strong legal argument,

his hat to the commercial bodies of San

"I undertake to sayâ and I challenge
refutation â that this lease does not pro
tect the rights cf the State: that its ful-
I.'.iment is not assured: that its transfer
to the Southern Pacific Company is not
prevented. It is like a jug handleâ all on
< ne side. The company get valuable prop
erty, the State nothing. It is a curious
fact that employes of the State are here
conducting a vigorous lobby for this bill."
Continuing. Johnson said he understood
that hÂ» was talking against a majority,
but he begged his colleagues not to yield
to the "seductive Influences" of the lobby.
Johnson argued that nothing in the lease
prevented another road from absorbing
the Santa Fe Company through a default
cf the latter in the payment of the In
terest on its bonds and the subsequent
purchase of it under foreclosure proceed
ings. Such absorption would carry with
it the lease. He said there was no penalty
for non-fulfillment of the terms of the
contract, and that litigation would be
endless.
'"The bill Is one of unusual importance."
Johnson bepan. "because of the unusual
U Qgtb of the lease; because of the hys
terical editorials that have been written
about it. and because of the unnecessary
heat that attended its debate in the Sen
ate.
Johnson oi>ened the contest when the
Mil came ::p at 2:30 p. ra. by demanding
that the measure be explained. Brown of
Fan Mateo, who introduced the corre-
Fpondiritr Assembly bill, paid no apology
Â¦was due frcm him for bringing up the
measure at that time. He said the bill
had the support of all the commercial
bodies of San Francisco. It had bfen
drawn by compftent attorneys and had
*>Â«?n under consideration for a long- tirnÂ«*.
The rights of the State were amply pro
t* < ted
Thtre were two provisions in the bill.
Brown one comirmlng leases
made by the Harbor Commissioners with
in a period of two years prior to the pas
sape of the act and the other specifically
ratifying ar.d confirming the lease of
<~hina .Basin to tl;** San Francisco and San
Jo-jquin Valley Railway Company. Brown
*r:t<Â»r^-d at some length Into a discussion

Johnson offered the only argument mada

BILL GOES TO
THE GOVERNOR
There was a call of the absentees, a
call of the house and numerous vain at
tempts to dispense with further proceed
ings under the call of the house. Speaker
Pendleton made the mistake, from his
point of view, of declaring a recess at
12 o'clock, during the call of the house,
and at 2 o'clock, Â¦when the Assembly re
convened, he was forced to declare the
call of the houÂ«e at ;in end. thoueh not
enoujrh men had been hunted out and
whipped into line to carry the bill.
Cowan offered an amendment to permit
the assessment of a franchise In the
county where "it is held. This was lost
by a tie vote of 35 to 35. An amendment
of this sort will be conceded to-morrow
to the opponents of the bill.
Cowan's Amendment Lost.
"I have every confidence In our As
sessor, lie is not like many others of
the State who are bending to corpora
tions 'the pregnant hinges of thÂ« knee
that thrift may follow fawning.' Why
are the lobbyists of the railroad here
lending aid to the passage of this bill,
holding out the inducement of their fa
vor to those who will help pass it?"
Fisk was .astonished that any one
should say the bill was a corporation
measure. It simply established a uni
form rule for assessment of franchisee
throughout the State. The amendment
was lost by a vote of 2S ayes to 34 noes.
Dunlap offered an amendment eliminat
ing this provision, by request of the As
sessor of San Joaauin County, who had
told him the passage of the bill would
mean a decrease in tlie assessment roll
of that county of between $200,000 an-1
$400,000. Fisk and Johnson made facetious
remarks about the Assessor of San
Joaquin County, and Dunlap retorted w.tn
anger:
The railroad leaders on the floor have
decided to agree to certain amendments,
which. It Is hoped, will conciliate some of
the country member/, and, armed with
these, they will ren.rar the conflict to
morrow. The opponents of the bill will
try to keep their forces In solid array,
and there Is prospect 01 U second pro
lonj^u struggle.
. â¢" Object- to the Measure.
The bill In question provides that the
franchise* of all quasi-public corporation^
except railroads shall be assessed in the
county in which such corporations havÂ«s j
their principal places jf business. Rail
roads are excepted. r.s such assessment
must be made by the -State Board vt
Equalization. The bill provides further
that "in the assessment of franchises of
a corporation the assessable value there
of shall be ascertained by taking from
the full cash value of its entire issued
capital stock the full cash value of all
other property assessed to it."

of this legislative session. The "good
dogs" and the independents were lined up
as they, have not yet bi.en on any measure,
and In the end the coloration men were
routed. They could muster but thirty
seven votes for the 'bill, and Fisk was
forced to change from aye to no in order
to give notice of a motion to reconsider.

To Prove What Swamp-Root, ths Great Kidney
Remedy, Will Do for YOU, Every Readsr of The
Call May Have a Sample Bottle Sent Free by Mail.
Among the rnanj* famous cures of
Swamp-Root investigated by The Call,
none seem to speak higher of the won-
derful curative properties of this great
kidney remedy than the one we publish
this week for the benefit of our readers.
Mrs. H. N. Wheeler of 117 Hieh Rock St..
Lynn. Maes., writes oa Xov. ;. 1900: "About
18 months ago I had a very severe spell of
sickness, i was extremely sick for three
weeks, and when I finally was able to leave
my bed I waa left with eicrutiatins pains In
my back. My water at times looked very like
rofTee. I could ras* b'lt little at a time, ana
then only after suffering great pain. My
physical condition was such that I had no
strength Â«nd was all run down. The doctors
sa'd my kidneys -were not affected, and while I
Did Not Know I Had
Kidney Trouble,
I Boaehow felt certain that my kidneys werÂ«
the ecus? of my trouble^ My sister. Mrs. C.
K. I/ttlefiÂ»ld. or Lynn, advised me to give Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root a trial. I procured a
bottle and inside of thnÂ»e days commenced to
Ret relief. 1 followed up that bottle with an- j
other, and st the completion of this one found i
I was completely cured. My strength re- j
turned, and to-day I am as well as ever. My j
business Is that of canvasser, I am on my fe*t ;
a rreat deal of the tl:r.Â«\ and have to use
much enenry in rÂ»>tÂ»lnjr around. My cure Is i
therefore all the more remarkable, and la ex-
ceedingly gratifying to me."

i i .^ r\..+. lt U3ed to â¢>* considered that only urinary

kidneys, but now modern science proves that
If You fVJpfiH nearly air diseases have th^ir beetnnlnjf fa thÂ»
Â¦ I I uu iÂ«CCU disorder of these most Important organs.
O.-.^-L. n.' x The kidneys filter and purify the bloodâ
OW3mp a KOOU that is their work. So when your kidneys are
. weak or out of order you can understand how
quickly your entire body is affected, and how every organ seems to fail to do Its
duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly," begin taking 1 the famous new discovery. Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon as your kidneys are well they will help all
the other organs to health. A trial will convince any one.
Many women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease Is not cor-
rectly understood: in most case? they are led to believe that womb trouble or fe-
male weakness of some sort is responsible for their many ills. when, la fact, dis-
ordered kldnevs are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.
Neuralgia, nervousness, headache, puffy or dark circles under the eyes, rheu-
matism, a dragging pain cr dull ache in the back, rveakness or bearing dqwn
sensation, profuse or scanty supply of urine, with strong odor, frequent desire to
pass it night cr day. with scalding or burning sensation,â these are all unmistak-
able signs of kidney and bladder trouble.
If there Is any doubt In your mind as to your condition, take from your urlns
on rising about four ounces, place it In a glass or bottle and let it stand twenty-
four hours. If on examination It Is milky or cloudy. !f there is a brick-dust set-
tling, or If small particles float about in it. your kidneys are in need of immedi-
ate attention. ; V
Other symptoms showing that you need Swamp-Roct are sleeplessness, dizzi-
ness, irregular heart, breathlessness. sallow, unhealthy complexion, plenty of am-
bition but no strength. -. . >. ---. '.:-Â¦-.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and Is u.Â«ed In the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by physicians In their private practice, and '.s takm by doctors them-
selves, because they recognize in It the greatest and most successful remedy that
science has ever been able to compound.
If you are already convinced that Swamp-Root is what you need, you can pur-
chase the regular fifty-cent and one-dollar bottles at the drug stores everywhere.
â¢=Â» DITOÂ«?IÂ£%L, NOTICE.- Swamp-Root, the great Kidney. Liver and
Bladder remedy, is so remarkably successful that a spteial arrangement has been
made by which all of our readers who have not already tried it may have a sam-
ple bottle sent absolutely free by mall. Also a book telling all about kidney and
bladder troubles and containing many of the thousands upon thousands of testi-

After casting about for a favorable lo-Â»
cation he decided that his best interest*.

other branch of the Italian colony, and
then began thÂ«Â» trouble.*
In the limited area of the Latin quarter

tion.

had lost, declared war upon them. Ba
caused the publication in an Italian paper
of the notice above. In this 13 Indicated a
challenge to mortal combat, but whether
the affair of honor will ever coma off Is Â»
serious question.
Dr. Delucis. with much volubility of ges
ture, say3 "he fears no man."
"That fellow Rossi." hÂ© said, "thinks he
runs the Italian colony. Sapristi. I meet
him any place he wants. Bab, fight me.
No'n, Flglio d'un cannone."
It seems that the tension between the
rival factions of tho colony haa led to a
wide-open breach. "What It3 members
may yet do is a question.
Rossi, who issued the published chal
lenge, says that he waa forced to do It
by thÂ© actions of Dr. Deluds.
"For nearly eighteen years I have hart
my same clerk Â¦with me whom the honor
able doctor haa tried to win away and put
in a drug store next to mine," said Rossi.
"I would die fighting rather than let thl.i
man get tho best of me."
A story is goinir around that a night or
two ago. In company with another drug
gist from the same quarter. Dr.. Delucis
was dining in a well-known restaurant.
Rossi came in and occupied a table at aa
opposite side of the main dining hall.
The courses were duly served before
the parties In interest discovered each
other's Identity. Then there was a scene.
"Bug&iMng Contaeh," exclaimed Rossi.
This means: "Don't move from there.**
and the flash of a table knife added lm
presslveness to the occasion. No trouble
followed because friends Intervened. I
Dr. Delucis and Dr. Ros3i deny that a
duel Is likely to occur between them, but
the warm blood of Italy, which courses*
through their vein?, is likely at any mo
ment to call for the cooling effect of a
combat. Then: "On euard, Rossi": "on

WESTCOTT HAS FAITH
IN HIS WIFE'S HONOR
Says She May Have Been Indiscreet
and Imprudent, but Nothing
More.
The following communication has been
received from F. B. Westcott, husband
of Lei Westcott, who has been named as
co-respondent Â¦ in the- suit for letral sep
aration brought by Mrs. Robert J. Han
cock: . - ,
SAN FRANCISCO, March 12.-Edltor Call-
Dear Sir: I wish to say that in view of all
that has been reported In last evening's and
this morning's papers regarding ray wife,
Mrs. Westcott, that while she may have been
Indiscreet and Imprudent previous to our re
union about one year ago, I - do , not, cannot
and will not. even- think, . or /believe, that she
haa ever been, or could, or would be .guilty of
anything more reprehensive. â¢ No, never! Her
very nature would revolt against 'Â¦" a sinful
thought or act, and while wo have lived apart
for seven months or more, for the very reason
that we have never been congenial; I -yet have
the highest respect for her as Â¦ a . virtuous
woman, pure in mind and heart, and I defy
any i man or woman to truthfully refute or
deny it. ' .-.-.-..
Tho mother of my. son la a woman who In
spires and commands the respect of any and
all -who know her, and furthermore,: in justice
to Mrs. W. aa well as myself, I also refute
and deny - that she has ever received - any sup
port other than from me since : she first . be
came my wife. What I say here denies every
charge or report derogatory to my wife that
has a tinge of color. Very sincerely, :
. , . - F. . B. ; WESTCOTT.

A Convicted Highwayman
Urges Judge to Increase
His Sentence
Before Zuhoff stood up for sentence
Deputy District Attorney Hynes addressed
the court, making a plea for clemency on
the ground that it was on Zuhoff' s confes
sion that a conviction had been secured.
The object of the attorney's benevolent
effort angrily told him to stop and when
Judge Greene announced that he would
take off two years from Zuhoff's term,
making 1 It ten Instead of twelve years, the
prisoner stepped to the clerk's desk and
asked him to lnterecede with the court to
have his sentence the same aa that pro
nounced against his companion.'
Judge Greene refused to alter his deci
sion. He said he thought that probably
the men would be the better for It if one
of them got out before the other, any way.
Then the two highwaymen were taken
back to Jail. Zuhoff denouncing- the Judge
for his action.
The confession on which the men were
convicted was to the effect that they were
drinking together with another man, .when
the trio ran out of money. They decided
to gt> out and rob the first man they saw.
As Millar came along the street they hid
behind a tree and as he passed he was
struck on the head with a board. Then
the robbers rifled his pockets, securing a
small sum in change.
Zuhoff and Thomas Magrulre held tip
David C. Millar on the night of February
23. Millar was struck down with some
blunt weapon at the corner of Thirty
fourth and Myrtle streets, aa he was
nearing his home, and robbed of his
money. Maguire and Zuhoff were arrested
that night and the next day Zuhoff con
fessed to the commission of the crime.
The two men were bound over for trial,
and at their hearing to-day they waived
their right of defense and asked to be
sentenced at once. Maguire was given
twelve years In San Quentin.
A convicted criminal standing; at the bar
of Justice and pleading for an Increase of
his term of Imprisonment waa the strange
spectacle presented In Judge Greene'3
court to-day, -when F. J. Zuhoff, footpad,
stood up that sentence might be pro
nounced against him.

HIGH SCHOOLS
WILL CONTEST
MEDICOS CRUSHINGLY
DEFEAT JOURNALISTS
Health Department and Morgue Base
ball Players Score a Glorious
Victory.
Nine bright young men who are em
ployed on the Examiner's art and repor
torial staffs essayed to play baseball yes
terday with as many medicos and Â¦ dep
uties who are drawing salaries from the
Health Department and the City Morgue.
The municipal aggregation snowed the
journalists under by a score of 25 to 3.
Had the same lasted more than five
Innings the scorer would not have had
room to score the tallies made by the
victors. The newspaper men were like so
many toys in the hands of the medicos.
Base hits, two-baggers and three-baggers
were as plentiful as flies around a barrel
of molasses. Cusick. and Matthews alter
nated in the box and the way tbe medi
cos hammered their curves would have
brought tears to the eyes of a Sphinx.
Had the error column been added up the
journalists would have had three dozen
to their credit. The medicos played more
consistent ball and batted like profession
als. "Fatty" Kahn. steward of the Re
ceiving Hospital, and "Shorty" Brown of
the Morgue were the bright particular
stars of the day. They played such good ;
ball that the prepossessing nurses In the
grand 6tand split their gloves applauding
their efforts.
Horace Egbert and "Fatty" Matthews
of Petaluma strove hard to abate defeat,
but their efforts were in. vain. The teams
lined up as follows: ,

OAKLAND RACETRACK â Tuesday.
March 12. 190Lâ Weather fine. Track
heavy.
S002. FIRST RACEâ Six furlongs; selling;
SANTA LUCIA, slated at 15 to 1
when the half-dozen four-year-olds
and upward went to the post yes
terday for the first race over 6lx
furlongs, made the field look bil
ious, especially the favorite Parmenion,
ridden, by O'Connor. Burlingame took
Lucia out at the very start and at no time
was her light dimmed by favorite, second
or third choice. Foul Play tried to tack
on and succeeded aa a wake performer.
O'Connor lay in wait In the third place
and came under the wire for the show
money. Santa Lucia glided in in laugh
ing style some five lengths ahead of Foul
Play, who barely captured the place.
The track was good, pretty. well dried
out. but not fast enough for the hard
surface goers and not sufficiently heavy
for the mud fanciers. Withal the first
race was the only upset of the day, all the
others being annexed by the favorites.
The two-year-old race, the second on the
card, belonged to Rory Ough. piloted by
Charlie Thorpe. Just because O'Connor
rode J. V. Kirby, and something warm in
the nature of a tip went round the ring, a
heavy play was placed on Kirby. Zlrl, rid
den by Domlnick, figured as a chance win
ner until the stretch was reached, when
Hory Ough reared ahead and Zirl came in
a slow second. Snooze proved her show
mettle again, securing the third place.
Kirby was fortunate in reaching the place
just without the money.
In. the steeplechase Eva Moe, the favor
ite, and Periwig ended in what was the
most exciting finish of the day. They
clung to one another throughout the
course, taking the last obstacle together.
Then the race down the stretch began,
Eva Moe winning by half a length. For a
wonder Tom Sharkey staid with the ob
stacles and did not go out. He finished
inside the money. '
The fourth race over one mile ended just
as the bookmakers' Elates Indicated. Havl
land, with Dominlck up, a 1 to 2 favorite,
walked away from the field. The hot work
was for the place and Bogus Bill, ridden
by Thorpe, came up to expectations, out
distancing Fondo and Lavator.
In the fifth race Isaline, Henry up,. was
a hot favorite, but it was only the strong
finish that gave her the race. Hermoso,
piloted by Domlnick, surprised the talent
and all but won. Handlcapper, second
choice, with Burns up, took the show
money.
The last race, seven furlongs for three
year-olds, went to Seide, a 3 to 5 favorite,
and was Henry's second victory. The tin
was out for Benson Caldwell, who was
backed down from 2 to 1 to even money.
O'Connor made a game finish, but Selde
was too strong. Cantinus led to the last
turn and then became lost in a pot of
Blue. â¢'.y.r .
BY IXDUIS HONTO.
AT TANFORAN TRACK
AN Owners' handicap over six fur
longs, with the three clipper
rigged sprinters Frank Bell, Len
r.ep and Sleehanu's as contestants,
furnished the large crowd of spec
tators at Oakland track j-esterday with a
very .puzzling betting proposition. Kot
since his first appearance, on the local
tracks, when racing in the colors of Sam
Hildreth.has Meehanus evinced any par
ticular fondness for heavy or muddy go
ing, and Caesar Young's horse was made
the outsider. Despite the fact that she
had- a tough time in beating Beau Or
monde only the day previous, and that
seldom do horses repeat well in deep foot
ing, Lennep. with her 95 pounds in the
saddle, at tirst enjoyed the call. It sud
denly dawned upon the "doplsts" that Bell
had shown best when tramping over damp
tracks, and the "St. Louis Hindoo" finally
closed a C to 5 favorite. From the klckotr
the race proved easy for Frank Bell, the
bay gelding stealing oft eight lengths in
the lead/and winning with. Mounce reach
ing for wraps. In a rattling four-round
finish Ranseh got Lennep by the judges a
nose ahead of Meehanus.
Things broke a bit uneven for the first
choices on the whole, but three staking
out winning claims. "Mike" Hennessy at
last left the maiden class, landing The
Buffoon first in the closing event, at odds
of 40 to 1. r
Never of much account on a fast track,
the conditions suited Bernota exactly, and
he took the opening scramble In a canter
at odds of 11 to 5. Montallade, the favor
ite, showed speed to the stretch, where he
began to stop, though getting the place
easily enough from Osmond.
"Handrlding" Kelly astride Modwena
turned up winner of the five furlong run,
next decided. The Morello mare made
nearly all the running, and In a drive
downed \ Don't Know, a 20 to 1 chance,
two lengths. A considerable delay at the
post did not improve the chances of the
favorite, Un Cadeau. which finished,
back among the tail-enders. .
Dr. Scharff fell heir to a legacy In the
two-year-old spin. Outclassing his field
and a prohibitive favorite, he finished six
lengths before Jack Tyrrell at the wire.
Barklyite took the show.
The Burns & Waterhouse stable had
My Gypsy primed and ready for active
duty on the firing line in the mile and
fifty yard selling number, and only for a
bumping match at the first turn the mare
might have delivered the merchandise. As
it was, she ran a fair second to the favor
ite, Norford. ridden by Mounce. Im
perious made a fair showing, ending up
in fourth position.
1 Dave Fountain's sprinter, Scallawag.
came in for extensive backing to win the
last event, a nix furlong selling affair.
Going to the post favorite, Mounce got
cut off at the start and could never get
to the front. While Quiz and Hagerdon
were having It out through the worst
footing Hennessy on The Buffoon picked
out the dryer going and at the close the
outsider was only galloping. Hagerdon
lasted out long enough to beat the favor
ite a neck for the place.
.
Track Notes.
Jockey Albert Songer, suspended by the
Oakland officials on December 30. 1899,
was reinstated yesterday by the stewards
of the California Jockey Club. He will
leave for Canada, and from there departs
for Austria to join the colony of American
riders.
John Bullman will very shortly depart
for the East to fulfill his engagement
with the McCarren stable. To disabuse
any idea existing that he-harbors any 111
feeling toward the .Oakland officials, he
will be seen in the saddle at the track
over iho bay this- afternoon.
In the absence of Bullman and Doml
nick, Owen Mounce was the star at Oak
land yesterday* piloting 1 three.-winners.-

CALL'S RAGING FORM CHART.
The match between Terry McGovern
and Dave Sullivan, which was', to be
fought before the Twentieth Century
Club of this city in April, has been de
clared off. That does not mean that the
"Terrible" Teddy will not appear, in a
local ring during April. He will be on
hand and opposed to him will be Oscar
Gardiner, a- feather-weight who once took
Sullivan's measure and who was once laid
low by the fierce onslaughts of Terry him
self.
The wires were kept hot last night with
Tim Hurst, manager of Sullivan, on one
side and Jim Kennedy, matchmaker of
the local club, on the other. Hurst, would
not guarantee the $1000 forfeit for weight
and the additional $1000 for, appearance
demanded by the Twentieth Century Club.
It is thought that the reasorKfor this is
that Sullivan knows that he could not
reach the 126-pound limit set in the agree
ment.
Negotiations by wire between Gardiner
and Kennedy and Harris. McGovern's
representative, were then conducted, the
result being a match between Gardiner
and McGovern for April 30 at 126 pounds.
Gardiner will leave . for this city im
mediately.
Harris has wired Jim Kennedy that he
will negotiate for a match between Mc-
Govern and Frank Erne upon his arrival
in San Francisco. ; Vi

the Hancock, ns she Jeft Manila seven
Cays before the latter verse!. It now looks
as'if the Buford would not get In until to
day.
On Sunday morr.ir.E last, in latitude SS

Hancock passed the Buford. The latter
was rot raaiir.? very good time, as she Is

She left Manila the same time as th*
Hancock, but was beaten thirty-six v ours
lrto Nagasaki.
The following named came up In the
cabin on the Hancock:
Private John L. Fox of Company A has
a thrilling' story of adventure to tell. On
January IS. 1900. he was captured in the
province of Laeruna de Bay by the Fili
pinos and held prisoner until the first
week In September, 1900. He made four
attempts to escape, but every time he got
lost In the bush and was recaptured. Fox
says the insurgents treated him well, but
nevertheless he never lost an opportunity
to get away. Finally they got tired of
caring for him and voluntarily took him
to within walking distance of the Ameri
can lines.
Captains Porterfleld and Newberry of
companies M and A distinguished them
selves in an engagement with General Ma
lolos. The Filipinos were intrenched on
the side of a mountain and their position
was deemed impregnable. The two com
panies of the Thirtieth made several at
tempts to storm the position, but each
time were driven back. Finally on a pitch
dark night they succeeded and captured
the entire Filipino detachment with the
exception of General Malolos and two of
his staff.
Brigadier General Campbell, â¢who came
home on the Hancock, formerly represent
ed the Twentieth Congressional District
of Illinois In the House of Representa
tives. He resigned his seat In order to
organize the Ninth Illinois Infantry and
went with that regiment to Cuba as its
colonel. From Cuba he went to the Phil
ippines as lieutenant colonel with the
Thirtieth Infantry. Later he was pro
moted to a brigadier generalship and was
ordered to report at Washington. D. C.
He speaks very highly of the Thirtieth
and says the men saw more hard fighting
than any other regiment In the islands.

With a smooth jea the Japanese are
confident that they can again place the
drag rope on the -vreck as Â¦was done by
them last week. Another trial will be
made as soon as the weather is favorable.
Starting from Fort Point the launches
and boats attempted to reach Mile Rock,
tut after going about an eighth of a mile
the heavy swell carried the ropes from
the deck fastenings. A second trial was
mode with like result, and though the
Japanese clung persl&tently to the work
it was found to be Impossible to achieve
any success.
The bar was breaking heavily when the
launches and boat3 started to pay out
the 600 fathoms of rope and attached lines
and it was with the greatest difficulty
that the men could work on the limited
space of the decks of the launches.
The Japanese divers of the firm of T.
Mori & Co. made another attempt yes
terday to find the Rio de Janeiro by drag
ging the Golden Gate with weighted ropes.
It Is a fact which has not been pub
lished heretofore that Major Blakeney has
edited and altered ' the shorthand tran
script of the testimony and proceedings in
thecase. On the days when the Investi
gation was in progress and the reporters
were present Sergeant Major Blakeney or
dered the shorthand reporter to strike out
of the transcript certain passages to which
he objected. A.t least one-fourth of the
matter in the questions put by him was
thus stricken out. Including notes evidenc
ing his displays of bad temper and irrita
bility! After the transcript had been man
gled and doctored to his satisfaction, the
witnesses were allowed to sign their testi
mony. This garbled transcript is to be
sent to "Washington as the shorthand re
port of the testimony and proceedings of
the so-called investigation, i It is a fact
also that Sergeant Major Blakeney re
fused to allow Ward McAllister, counsel
for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
to ask certain questions of the witnesses,
and for that reason Mr. McAllister ab
sented himself after last Friday from the
farcical investigation. He left the ser
geant major alone In his glory to bullv
Hodgson and Elllngson and insult the
press which had dared tell the truth about
his Improper method of conducting an In
vestigation ordered by his superiors.

Sergeant Major Blakeney, superintend
ent of the Life-savlngr Department of the
Twelfth District, evidently thinks his of
fice is a private room devoted to him
self and Inaccessible to the public. Just
as some officials think that public office
is a Drlvate cinch. "When the newspaper
reporters called yesterday for the pur
pose of witnessing the Interesting cere
mony of the witnesses signing the tran
scripts of their testimony, and the ser
geant major's editing the same, he met
them at the door and informed them that
they could not come in; that he was not
"receiving company."

When the Harvard dormitory Known as -Trinity

rooms in the building opened his piano and began

NEW YORK, March 11â Tha followlnx
THE first annual meeting of this new association,
at Denver on the 5th inst., appears by the re
ports to have been a conspicuous success^ The
convention sat three days, including orue night session.
It adopted a constitution, selected Denver as a per
manent location and outlined its purpose to make that
city an exchange point at which cattle men can meet,
at the time of the association's annual convention,
fcr the purpose of bargain and sale, purchase and
exchange of cattle. This will prove a great economy
and convenience for the men who grow stockers ani
those who sell their calf crop to the rangers and for
the breeders of bulls in Iowa and Missouri. The
annual meeting will also be an annual cattle market,
not for beef but for the stock that is to be grown into
beef on the range.
The association is limited in membership to men
whose paramount interest is, cattle growing. At the
convention of the National Live Stock Association
in Salt Lake City, in January.Hhe sheep interest ag
gressively dominated, and cheered Professor Lind
quist when he read a paper denouncing the cattle in
terest as so injurious to the country that its suppres
sion by law should be considered. That roused the
patient cattle men to resistance and the new organi
zation is the result.
At its first meeting the feeling was strong for pro
jecting the forest reserves against all grazing, and for
increasing rather than decreasing their, area. The
issue of leasehold protection of the ranges on the pub
lic domain was squarely made and carried with only
twenty dissenting votes in the entire assembly, in
which eighteen States and Territories were represented.
The leasing resolution was introduced in the first
day's session and referred to the. executive commit
tee for report. This seems to have stirred the sheep
men and politicians in the Colorado Legislature, and
that body proceeded to pass an anti-leasing memorial
to Congress, informing that body that the people of
Colorado were unanimously opposed to leasing. This
memorial was sent to the Cattle-Growers' Association
fo; indorsement and was promptly voted down, nine
tenths of the Colorado delegates voting against it.
Having suppressed this pernicious move of the politi
cians, the convention adopted the leasing resolutions
and appointed a committee to draft a bill for a leasing
law to be introduced at the next session of Congress.
The association, which was started in January, al
ready has a paid membership of 500, and the secretary
is notified of 1000 applications for membership to be
passed upon by the executive committee, which is in
structed to admit only those whose paramount inter
est is in cattle. It. is expected that the roll of next
year's convention will show a membership of nearly
3000, which will demonstrate that the cattle men re
sent Professor Lindquist's 'classification of them,
among the pests of the country.
A Californian, F. C. Lusk of Chico, was elected
president, and the executive committee for this State
are Jeff Bradley of Merced and W. M. Newhall of San
Francisco.

the cost of the memorial which the State is to raise
over his tomb should be provided in strict accord with
the governmental principles of which he was all his
life a stalwart champion.
In appropriating money for a monument to Whit*
the Legislature should proceed in a manner worthy
of the St3j**-3nd of the statesman whose service it
intends to commemorate. A' bill appropriating the
sr.ro designed for the monument should be drawn up
in due form and enacfed as any other appropriation
liillj It should be passed by both the Assembly and
tne Senate and receive the sanction and signature of
the Governor. If provided for by an appropriation
made in that regular and formal way, the monument
will stand as a clear expression of . the will of all
branches of the government of California, and there
would never be any word of dissatisfaction from the
people. If on' the other hand the sum be taken from
the contingent fund there will be always a feeling that
the appropriation was made irregularly and in viola
tion of the spirit of the constitution.
The Legislative contingent fund was designed by the
constitution to be used solely for legislative purposes.
It is subject to the Legislature and can be appro
priated without the consent of the Governor. Over
it the I-egislature has absolute control. It can be
used for any purpose the Legislature chooses, but it
is clearly the intent of the fundamental law of the
State that ft should be used solely for the expenses of
legislation. The ver^ fact that the constitution gives
the legislative branch of the government full control
of the fund ought to render the legislators extremely
careful in'the use of it. Let once a precedent be es
tablished for appropriating any portion of it for other
than strictly legislative expenses, and there is no tell
ing what uses may be made of it later on.
Let it be understood at die outset that the people
of California warmly approve of the proposal to erect
at the expense of the State a monument to the gifted
man who rendered such brilliant and useful service
to the commonwealth, and whose patriotism was as
unquestioned as his genius. All citizens desire that
California's grateful remembrance of Stephen M.
VÂ»'hite shall be made manifest by a monument raised
by the State itself. Upon that phase of the issue there
are no differences of opinion worth taking into ac
count. When, however, it is proposed that the money
for the purpose shall be taken from the Legislative
contingent fund there is raised another question, and
when due consideration is given to it, the judgment of
the people will be adverse to the proposal.
BY concurrent resolution it is proposed by the
Legislature to appropriate ?25OO of the Legisla
tive contingent fund for the purpose of erecting
a monument to Senator Stephen M. White. While
there can be no question of the authority of the Legis
lature to make such appropriation from that fund, it
is to be hoped the resolution will not be agreed to.
It would be a wrong :n ijself and would establish a
precedent out of which m^ch greater wrongs would
be sure to come. j

Bitter Defeats Met by Women.
This work planned to the leeal
rights of â¢ women, - but is particularly for
the. unfortunate or helpless. Not all thes>e
measures will pass, for.woman'a lnfluenrÂ»
has its limits. The Nr.w York club" felt
this keenly when their favored measure
failed to pass. They Â«iakcd for a State in
dustrial school for/girls, where household
arts and crafts could be taught to girls as
other established schools were teaching
manual work for boys. -They. felf that the
The first effort known to history when
women's pleadings gained legal rights was
the asking from Moses by the daughters
of Zelophehad for a share in their de
ceased-father's real estate. The daughters
of Zelophehad were not members of the
General Federation of Women's Clubs, .but
an independent non-auxiliary- association,
doubtless considered very presumptuous
In asking such favors. But after their re
quest was granted no other woman felt
any compunctions about accepting the
â¢benefits which accrued through this pre
sumption. From that time on Borne women
have been brave enough to ask Jor cer
tain desired rights from their legal supe
riors, and many women without hesita
tion have accepted the results of their
work. '. ..* '8 Â¦>â¢ '"â¢?Â¦''Â¦
The great woman movement of the last
half-century had In it, however, fewer of
the societies which ask for rights than it
had of societies which sought to confer
bounties, or -asked favors for themselves
or others. The religious, abolition, mis
sionary, humane, temperance and philan
thropic organizations were of those that
sought to give help to others.
There were through the early years
small groups of earnest women who did
ask for women- all rights which men en-
Joyed. They asked this merely on the
ground of justice and not because of tne
great good they might accomplish, which
latter motive doubtless would have proved
more powerful to the majority of women.
Besides those groups of women there
have come to great prominence In the last
ten or twenty years other groups organ
ized principally for self-culture. These
are the women's clubs. They began with
exhaustive studies of the past, but coon
came to thorough study of the presentâ of
living people and living questions.eHaving
hearts, they could not fall to be touched
by grief; having minds, they could not be
prevented from searching for causes and
suggesting remedies, and, having con
sciences, they could not be withheld from
earnest, consecrated effort
Grievous Results of Unjust Laws..
To some the wrongs under which their
own sex suffered appealed strongly, ana
they discovered that ur.just laws were the
foundation of some of these wrongs. They
believed that married women ought no
longer to suffer under the disabilities
theretofore imposed by lawâ that they
should have a right to their own wages, a
right -to control property given to or
earned by them, a right to a share in thdr
children's custody and training and to a
portion" of the family Income and a right
to" help choose the family home. They
said that women should have a right to
receive the benefits of schools supported
by public money, a rignt to fair and equal
wages at employment for which they had
Bpecial adaptation, a right to enter any
profession or employment, a right to jus
tice in the courtroom, a right to protec
tion of their persons from assault ana
disease and protection of their property
from unjust seizure, unfair taxation anJ
outside encroachments. Such legal right
should be assured to all women. When n
woman or a club of women began to tnir.K
about these subjects they soon wished to
secure legal rights for women.
While It may be Â¦ natural for a club
woman to claim a great, deal of what has
been accomplished to'be due to the influ
ence of clubs, it must be admitted that
it is only recently that the clubs auxiliary
to State and national federations have in
terested themselves in securing legal rec
ognition of these rights,- for only curing
the last decade have these combinations
of clubs arisen, and Ion? before that many
States had made changes in the law re
lating to women. It miÂ«ht be safely saU
that before the organization of the Gen
eral Federation of Woman's Clubs or
State federation much of this work hail
been done by other organizations of
women, notably the suffrage associations.
Work of Individual Reformers.
Progressive, cultured women twenty,
thirty and even thirty-flve years ago ac
complished many changes. Women' like
Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony lec
tured from town to town about the in
justice of depriving women of these rights
and aroused many to petition Legislatures,
Congresses and City Councils. Some Influ
enced their law-making friends. For in
stance, in Illinois, in those earlier days,
men like Judge Tuley, Judge, Bradwell,
the late Senator M. B. Castle, the revered
Senator D. L. Whiting, felt bo much the
spirit of equality which was the goal of
the women of their families and acquaint
ance that they made the woman's cause
their own, and labored to pass laws just
to women. This Was not merely the gra
tuitous effort of chivalrous men, but work
influenced to a great extentâ how far we.
can never knowâ by such women as Kath
erlne Tuley, Myra Bradwell and Lillian
Whiting.
The securing of certain rights, such as
the right to enter professions, has not
been, as a general rule, the work of any
organization, but of individual women.
Take, for example, the. right of women to
practice law, striven for in various States
during the past thirty years. That women
were forbidden to practice law did not in
convenience many women nor appeal to
the sympathies of the mass of women. So
the particular woman who desired this
right made her individual struggle alone
through courts and Legislatures and when
the right was once established, It stood
there for all women.
Unselfish Labor for Others.
Some clubs In their infancy have been
afraid of public questions and others
older may have but tardily outgrown their
infantile fear of the bugaboo "woman's
rights." But the clubs as a rule are not
now alarmed at the discussion of public
questions. Much of their public work is,
however, on local and municipal matters
and on State and national questions which
affect men . and women equally. The
preservation of forests, of cliff dwellings,
of noted historical spots, of places of re
nowned beauty, of colonial manor houses,
of churches, of battlefields, of records, the
efforts in behalf of, proper management of
State institutions, the work to perfect the
fiublic schools, to establish State traveling
ibrariesâ this valuable work takes much
time, is helpful to the community at large,
is work with lawmakers, but is not an ef
fort to gain legal rights for women. How
ever, many clubs are now instructing their
legislative communities to look after the
rights of women.
It is interesting to notice that organized
womanhood has been keener to discern the
actual injustice to a small number of un
fortunate and suffering women than to see
the posible wrongs to the many average
normal women. They have asked for wo
men custodians of women criminals In
Jails and police stations, for reform
schools? to help . girl delinquents, for wo
manly care of women paupers and insane,
for legal protection to women workers
from long hours, unjust fines and unsani
tary conditions.
The clubs of Wisconsin, Georgia, Con
'necticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and other
States are asking better legislation for
working women and. children.
The clubs of Georgia want matrons In
all city jails. Michigan clubs secured the
passage of a bill making it obligatory to
have women physicians in State institu
tions where women and children are held
California and Vermont clubs are working
for a similar law. The Chicago Woman's
Club has long stood for this principle
Florida clubs are already striving to raise
the age of protection of a girl's chastity
from 10 to 18 years," and clubs in other
States will indorse such bills when pre
sented. Georgia also asked that the mar
riage age of girls be raised from 10 to 16
years.
RIGHTS OF WOMEN.
(COPYRIGHT, 1901.)
By Catherine Waugh McCulloch.
IV.â INFLUENCE OF WOMEN'S CLUBS IN SECURING THE LEGAIi
sixty homes in their State for fallen
women would 'not be bo overcrowded if as
girls the inmates had been Instructed in
some useful occupation. The courtesy or
the legislators and their promise to givs
the matter careful consideration encour
aged the women. . Their hopes fell when
later they received word that the iuÂ» a?
were so low and the necessities for other
objects so gTeat that the appropriation
needed "<wild not be made. About tne
same day, however, the Legislature had
funds enough to establish In a male col
lege a chair in veterinary science at tne
cost of $200,000 and to appropriate SloO.OOO
for a military parade. It is natural to
suppose that these unselfish women ear
nestly desired somethJnff in the lu}Â»oi
rights and power just then and wisneo
that they were not limited to begging tor
such bills aa favors.
In Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan ear
nest efforts were made for better accom
modation for women students at the State
universities and colleges. The Illinois bill
was vetoed by the Governor, but trie
Michigan measure was successful.
In some of the States the women are yet
beg-ging admittance to such schools. The
Georgia Club urged a bill admitting
women to the State University and to the
textile department of their school of tech
nology. "â¢Â¦â¢(Â¦--; :'/Â¦ .--.
. Earnest "Work Novr in Progress.
Notice that these efforts ara purely un
selfish, the securing of rights for women
other than the petitioners. Even the
effort to secure laws allowing women to
be placed on school boards is not so much
to give women rights as to improve the
schools. In Arkansas, Connecticut. New
Hampshire, Georgia and ' Tennessee the
State club organizations work for this
and many local clubs In States where
such laws have been previously passed
work to have their provisions carried out.
Delaware clubs are working to 6ecure a
vote on school questions and the Minne
sota clubs rejoice over success in gaining
the vote on library matters. . The Georgia
clubs were able to prevent the passage of
a bill forbidding a woman the right to be
Assistant State Librarian.
Connecticut clubs are Investigating the
guardianship laws; Massachusetts and
Missouri clubs the laws relating to
women employes, and the clubs in several
other States are making special study of
laws relating to women and trying to
secure better enforcement of good- laws.
Rhode Island clubs are publishing a vol
ume of the laws relating to women.
The foregoing is what the clubs are
now actually doing or what they did last
year, v Such unselfish charitable work In
the Improvement of laws deserves suc
cess, but has often been followed by fail
ure. For example, the Georgia clubs
worked faithfully for a bill to raise the
age of protection for girls from 10 years,
for a bill prohibiting the labor of children
under 12 in factories and for a bill to
admit women to the State Textile School.
All .three of these measures have been
defeated by the Georgia representatives,
representing surely not the womanhood
of the State.
The Vermont LeglslaturÂ© has also de
feated a woman's club bill providing for
women on boards of asylums where
women are confined.
These are bitter lessons. A Georgia
woman In the Atlanta Journal says:
"Women In Georgia are growing a little
tired of hearing about their influence as
being all-powerful and finding it upon test
to be absolutely nothing." But as long
as women are deprived of the ballot they
must expect many defeats of cherished
bills before the continual dropping of peri
suasion and petitions and influence can
wear away the stone of prejudice.
Much Still Bemains to Be Done.
Notwithstanding such defeats the State
Legislatures this winter are meeting many
progressive clubwomen ardently cham
pioning bills to secure various legal rights
for women. They also meet members <3f
the suffrage associations., whose primary
object is the ballot but who nave always
worked also for lesser rigMts. The Na
tional American Suffrage Associations,
when required by State societies, has been
recommending to each the legislation
most needed and most likely to win suc
cess.
Lawmakers will have little opportunlty
thls winter to- err ignorantly. There is
much yet to be accomplished, though
after-dinner speakers, referring to the
progress in the nineteenth century, gen
erally talk in such glowing terms of
woman's advanced position as to lead one
to infer that there is nothing more to be
desired. But there is still something more
to be done before all the rights of women
are secured. The twentieth century has
a chance to improve on the past.
In some eight States wives have either
no control or only partial control over
their own property, and In twice as many
no control over their wages.
In some States the law of courtesy still
prevails by which the husband has the use
of all the wife's real estate during his life;
even after her death, should she have
given birth to a living child. In these
States the wife has only dower in her
husband's real estate â that Is, the use of
one-third after his death.
While many States provide for a wife's
support suited to her condition In life,
which, however. Is often hard to enforce,
in others she can compel no support unless
divorced.
Why Women Need the Ballot.
In many States wives are made equally
liable for family support, but In most they
are allowed no share in family Income. In
three-fourths of the States mothers are
not equal to fathers Jn the guardianship
of their children. In about half the States
the age of protection for a girl's chastity,
called the age of consent, is 14 years or
lower. In many States seduction is no
crime. In several of the States women
are not admitted to the bar nor to higher
schools of learning and can hold no elec
tive position.
In. all tho States, except the four where
women vote, the wages of women are on
the averajre much lower than those of
men" employed on'the same kind of -work.
The knowledge of such gross inequality
and legal injustice convinces woman that
they are yet distant from the millennium.
Even when laws are theoretically fair
and eaual it Is difficult sometimes to se
cure their just enforcement for women in
courts officered only by men. elected or
appointed by men only. Women's lack of
political power operates to their disad
vantage in securing and enforcing legal
rights. From her that hath not political
rights are taken .away even the' legal
rights which she hath. â¢ Â¦ Â¦.-â¢Â¦Â¦
The , struggle to secure the- ballot- for
women is another story, but until the bal
lot is obtained Â¦ women will meet with
many defeats r in securing further legal
rights and in holding fast those now al
lowed. .The ballot In the hands of Ameri
can womanhood will be the one assurance
of stable justice to women. . â¢â¢â¢.-. â¢

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
Our apocryphal ancestress was merely used to teach
the unwisdom of forbidding too much. Therefore,
let the expurgatory committee of the Boston library
beware lest it do more harm than good by writing
"Thou shalt not" across the book list.
" The story of Eve and the forbidden fruit has been
uniformly misinterpreted and its misapplication has
been thundered from every pulpit. Its real lesson is
that in human nature there is an unquenchable and
ineradicable disposition to seek the forbidden, to pur
sue the excluded and keep company with the out
lawed. "How delicious it would be, if it were only
wicked to drink it," cried the French woman, as she
swallowed a glass of water.
If every man is his own keeper it will keep him
busy, and if he do it well his example does more far
his brother man than if he interfered with his reaj
ing, his eating and his drinking, and dictated the path
by which he must approach his Maker.
The Boston plan is in denial of the free agency and
personal responsibility of human beings. The re
ir.ark of Cain, "Am I my brother's keeper," has been
nisread and misinterpreted into a solemn negative
affirmation that man is the keeper of every other man,
r.rd that idea has introduced much evil into human
society.
As it was proved on her trial that the lady who
bid down her novel and took up her gun to do her
husband to death, and muss the bed clothes with
blood, owed the old man a grudge anyway, we thinl:
thst extenuating circumstances may be pleaded in be
hrlf of the novel. Her crime might be attributed to
late coffee or the effect upon her nerves of a mis
matched ribbon, or anything else that would play with
a harsh finger upon a too sensitive nature.
Were they any worst husbands, fathers, and espe
cially grandfathers, for that early and stolen glimpse
into an unreal world, where in the fairy land of fiction
in.possible lads and lasses lived and loved in an im
probable way, and such robbers as never were, robbed
in. a way that never was, and even Alibez and the
Devil misbehaved impossibly in an impossible desert?
And our knotty and gigantic old grandfathers, did
they not resort to the haymow Sundays to read in
secret "Rinaldo Rinaldine," the unexpurgated "Ara
bian Nights," "The Decameron" and even "The
Pirste's Own Book"?
But it was not always thus. What better women
have lived than our grandmothers, who wept pure
pearls over the sorrows of "Alonzo and Melissa,"
"Paul and Virginia" and "The Scottish Chiefs"?
One very sound and sober-minded lady, of a literary
turn and celebrity, has said that romance does more
harm in the world than whisky. So it would seem
that another Carrie Nation is needed to hack romance
into kindling wood, and with her hatchet abolish that
partner of whisky in the work of undoing the human
rjce.
After all, there are some modern instances of the
wisdom of their plan, if it could absolutely put such
books out on the first base. The lady who sat up till
midnight reading one of these recent purpose novels
and immediately rose and got a gun and killed her
husband while he snored on his pillow is an awful
evample that the committee might quote in justifica
tion of its action.
The modern Boston idea seems to be that the peo
ple must not be trusted to chew their own literature,
lest that which is sweet on the lip shall turn bitter in
the moral stomach. Therefore, the case-hardened
masticating committee of the Boston library will chew
and spit out all books that are judged unsuitable .for
publfc digestion I
And. this is in New England, the native heath of Har.
riet Beecher Stowe and Edward Bellamy, where "Un
cle Tom's Cabin" was a sub-Bible, and Hawthorne
displayed morbid moral anatomy, and "Looking
Backward" captivated all who dislike to wash dishes 1
"Eleanor" and "The Soft Side" are excluded- as
hectic and unwholesome. Others are sent into outer
darkness for excess of sentiment, surplus of romance
and lack of artistic construction. The "purpose"
novels, written to point a moral or adorn a tale in
propagation of some social, ethical, religious or politi
cal theory, are mowed down with all the impartiality
of the Reaper, Death, "Who mows the bearded grain
at a breath, and the flowers that grow between."
IT is just now made known that the book committei
of the Boston public library has an Index Expur
gatorius, On which appears nearly 4 ;, every-: recent
novel that has made a star in the reading and literary
world. The impressionist schooi of readers will be
appalled to know that "To Have and to Hold" heads
the list of recent fiction that is rigidly excluded. The
reason given is that the agony of this novel is too
much bunched up, and that there is enough of it ta
have been evenly distributed as a misery through the
whole book.
EXPURGATED FICTION.
William. McKinley merits a reception such as no
man ever received before. He has been the states
man of prosperity. As Senator Hoar once said in the
Senate, he "is the most loved President we have ever
had." He has served the people faithfully and well.
He has made our national welfare the wonder of the
world. Let us give him a welcome that will be ideally
Californian.
For the purpose of providing an adequate recep
tion, the requisite committees should be appointed at
once. In selecting the men who arc to act for San
Francisco in the matter great care should be exer
cised. In affairs of this kind there are always many
persons eager to be prominent in order that they may
bask in the sunshine of the Presidential presence and
make a show of being something in the way of great
men themselves. As a rule such persons are not not
able for public spirit or for patriotism. They are in
no way representatives of California. Their presence
on the reception committee could do the city and the
State no good, and might do some harm. Let all
such seekers after a passing notoriety be denied. Let
us have in the forefront of our people to welcome the
President none but men wh.o are recognized as fitted
to illustrate our commonwealth.
After the people comes the welfare of the State. The
tour of the President and his Cabinet is mainly to
enjoy a holiday in California, but statesmen of their
rank are in the habit of learning the needs of their
country even when resting from their ordinary labors.
To every member of the Presidential party the visit
to the State will be an opportunity to learn much con
cerning its resources, its industries, its possibilities and
its requirements in the way of Federal legislation. To
aid them in profiting by the opportunity will be the
duty of every Californian who comes into contact with
them. In a particular degree the duty rests upon the
men who represent the great interests of California to
make clear to the President and to the Cabinet wherein
the welfare of the State can be served by them in thei"
official capacity. In all the glory and the glow of the
grand parades, festivals and receptions, we are not to
overlook the fact that -the President has come to see
not only the beauties of our land but its wealth and
worth and wants.
Next to the pleasure and convenience of the Presi
dent and his party there must be taken into considers*-'
tion the will and pleasure of the people of CaltforniaJ
He is the elect of the people, and his welcome should
be popular in form as well as in spirit. There should
be no attempt on the part of a clique to monopolize
him, or to keep the people away from him. He is to
be the guest of all the Californians, and accordingly
the people as a whole should be in evidence at every
notable feature of the reception given him.
There remains to be considered other phases of the
welcome.' The President will be attended by his Cabi
net, and he has announced that he will not place him
self in the hands of any committee, but will arrange
his own programme. That determination cannot be
in any way distasteful to us, for we can wish no better
than that our guest should do what is most pleasing
to himself an-d his party, and see in the State' that
which he and they most desire to see. Whatever ar
rangements are made therefore should be prepared with
the full understanding that they are primarily for tho
honor of the President, and all other purposes are
secondary.
CALIFORNIA'S welcome to President McKin
ley should be made notable enough to win a
national repute. He is to come to us at a sea
son when the full beauty of the land will be seer,
under its fairest aspect. Nature herself will garland
his road with flowers from one' end of
the State to the other, and we -may' be
sure that the ladies will be prompt to raise
bowers of beauty around every station where his train
is to stop. So far then as the festal features, of his
tour are concerned, we need have no fear of the re
sult. The President comes to the most beautiful State
in the Union, and he will find it worthy of its fame.
CALIFORNIA AND THE PRESIDENT.
THE JSAN FRANCISCO CALI^ WEDNESDAY,' >MA"RCH - 13; 1901.
Some enterprising men in San Jose hope to get
the Carnegie library building in that city so far ad
vanced that the President can lay the cornerstone
when he comes out on his visit; and it is to bt hope'il
they will succeed. It would be a good way of show
ing the world how fast San Jose can move when she
gets started.
Among the optimists of the time none is more san
guine and cheerful than Booker T. Washington. D*
cpite all the political and social wrongs and lynch law
outrages inflicted upon his race, he goes right along
talking and writing of the bright outlook ahead, and
assuring the negroes that if they practice industry an 1
thrift they will soon be out of reach of such white men
as are trying to thwart their. progress: and it is worth
noting that Washington practices what he preaches

The Pacific Commercial Museum has
bumped up against a general. The colli
sion is the direct result of the search by
the museum authorities for space. in the
ferry building for the Installation of ex
hibits and for office use. A part of the
great nave at the north end of the build
ing suited the needs of the museum, and
a committee, headed by A. Bbarboro, went
to the offices of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners and talked with some of
the members, making known the desire
to be tenants. The space desired has been
used for some time by the San Francisco
and North Pacific road as an upper wait
ing room, principally for ladles. When
the talk of the museum committee with
the Harbor Commissioners was over the
committee members had the Idea that
they were authorized to go ahenal and
fence in a certain portion of the nave at
the north end.
The next move was to hire a carpenter
and buy lumber. Then the ripping of saws
was heard, followed closely by the rip
ping of oaths on the part of the Sausallto
commuters. However, a partition was put
up. "ncloslng a space that had served for
the accommodation of th# commuters,
and a secondary partition was started to
inclose an office area. By this time the
commuters had communicated with Gen
<yal Dickinson, and he was called upon
by them to visit the Harbor Commission
ers, which he did, expressing himself with
much vigor. The Harbor Commissioners
notified the Commercial Museum man
agers that they would have to suspend
work, pending some Bort of a settlement,
and the ripping of saws and of oaths
mopped simultaneously. The Commercial
Museum offered to do anything that
could be done to give added accommoda
tions on the. ground floor of the ferry
building and providing for the expense.
General Dickinson has been busy pre
paring a letter to be addressed to the
Harbor Commissioners bearing the sig
natures of Bausalito commuters. The
executive board of the Commercial Mu
seum has been trying to arrange a con
ference with the Harbor Commissioners
and General Dickinson. That conference
would have been set down for to-day had
It not been that General Dickinson went
cut of town yesterday and may not be
back for a day or two. The matter may
be settled soon to the satisfaction of all
concerned.

THE 'first recital of Mme. Teresa

noon at Shermaji-Clay Hall to a
large and highly enthusiastic
house. The following programme
was given:
Fantaisie (Mozart): eonata. Op. 31, No. 3,

It is too late in the day to criticize "he
well-known characteristics of Carreno:
suffice it to say that all the fascination,
brilliancy, splendor of temperament, he
roic grandeurs that we are accustomed
to associate with her name are all here in
fullest measure, just as we learned and
loved them two years ago, on her last
visit to California. She is In admirable
form. The- Beethoven sonata was grlven
with a peculiar warm sympathy and ripe
ness of interpretation that lent new grace
to its lovely measures. The Chopin num
bers, more especially the G flat study,
which was graciously repeated In response
to an imperative encore, and a colosso!
rendering of the B minor "Scherzo,"
aroused a storm of applause. The Chopin
"Barcarolle," incomparably dainty in tho
rendering of its calm poetry, was given,
as encore to the Chooin group. The tre
mendous Schumann "Fantalsie"' simply
swept all before it. and the Paeanlnl-
LJszt "Campanella," n famous tour de
force of Mme. Carreno. closed the pro
gramme. At to-morrow evening's recital
will be given the "Etudes Symphonlques"
of Schumann, B flat minor sonata of

and the Schubert-Taussig- "Marche Mili

The annual report of President Chipman
was not ready for the meetlpg yesterday,
but it will be given out In the course of a
few days. *
The California exhibit will occupy 20,000
square feet of the Horticultural building
at the Buffalo exposition, being almost
one-third of the area of the entire struc
ture. The exhibit will flank the main en
trance. 1
The exhibit which California will make
at Buffalo will be the finest ever sent out
of the State. One of its features will be a
"progressive beet sugar exhibit," donated
by the Spreckels beet sugar refineries.
It will show the manufacture of beet
sugar in all its grades, beginning with the
raw beet and ending with the article of
commerce. The mineral resources. of the
State will be represented and a lavish
showing made of fresh and dried fruits,
canned fruits, cereals, flour, honey and beo
culture, hemp and flax products, wines,
oils, citrus and deciduous products, etc.
A novel display will consist of the wild
flowers and sea. flora of the State. -
The officers and directors of the Board
of Trade were elected yesterday for the

While all counties will be asked to take
part In the display, those in. charge will
not allow any one county to '"boom." it
self to the detriment of its sister counties.
The Southern Pacific Company will also
co-operate with the State Board of Trade
and will install the bulk of its Paris ex
hibit at the Buffalo Grounds. Part of this
exhibit comprises the display made by
the State in Paris.
It was agreed at yesterday's meeting
that the Board of Trade and the Southern
Pacific Company should work together in
making the California display at Buffalo.
Forty per cent of tho exnense will bo
borne by the Board of Trade and CO per
cent by the railroad company. The board
is to pay the expenses and salary of See*
retary Filcher and tha railroad company
will take care of the other attaches.
After a discussion, in which all present
took part, it was decided that the Call
fornian exhibit at Buftalo should be dis
tinctly a State display.' It was shown. by
Wi H. Mills that where counties had ex
hibited independently at the Paris Kx
position an injustice was done to other
counties, in many instances visitors being
told that the entire display was the prod
uct of a certain section of the State.
J. A. Barr and J. M. Kyle, representing
the Stockton Chamber of Commerce, wore
also on band and stated that the body

Paine's Celery Compound.
Each at Height of His Career Uses
Champion long-distance rider of the
world. . -'.:Â¦'_ L : y-'.
"After the exertion of my record rldea.
I was advised to use Paine's Celery Com-
pound. I am pleased to say that It gave
such satisfaction that I was Impelled to
use it again. I believe that wheelmen and
athletes wiil find Paine's Celery Com-
pound of assistance In keeping up their
physical tone." Jimmy Michael.
Champion C. W. Miller, winner of the
six-days' bicycle race at Madison Square
Garden, N^w York City, says:
"I owe to Paine's Celery Compound a
debt of personal gratitude. For several
years I have occasionally used Palne'a
Celery Compound when I felt out of sorts
and run down. â¢ Before the big race In
New York, feeling -that' I ought to be In
the best possible - condition, because a
nervous breakdown on the track Is one
thing all well-1 rained men are afraid ofâ
I began to use Paine's Celery Compound.
It was an essential part of my successful
training. I assure you that It did me so
much good, I wish that others may have
tho benefit of my experience."
Yours sincerely, C. "*V\ Miller.
"Wonderful Jimmy Michael In recom-
mending Palne'3 Celery Compound said:â
"Boston, Mass., Feb. 21. 1S97."
"Before I began to train for the six-day
race at Madison Square Garden, New
York City, I was In poor condition. I took
Paine's Celery Compound, and after the
first bottle'l felt entirely different. I con-
tinued to take It up to the time the race
started and during the week of the con-
test. My excellent condition is due to
Paine's Celery Compound. I recommend
It to all who need a perfect restorer of ex-
hausted nervous energy."
Sincerely yours.
H. D. Elkes.
The New York TVorld says of Champion
Elkes, whose likeness Is given above:
"There Is no reason why Elkes should not
claim the World's championship, having
beaten. every crack rider In America and
Europe." Like his great predecessors,
Michael and Miller, Elkes believes Paine's
Celery Compound to be tho most wonder-
ful preparation in the world for strength-
ening the nervous system. He has con-
sented to the publication of the 'following
letter:
New York, December 21, '1900.
Elkes, Michael and Miller, each at the
height of his career, used' Paine's Celery
Compound and acknowledge a debt of per-
sonal gratitude to the great remedy.

Nrd? York Stock Market.
NEWJ- TORK. March 12â The stock market
continued spotty to-<Jay and largely made up
of the operations of professional traders ln In
dividual stocks. Many of these operation? were
based on caubeÂ» peculiar to the stocks affected
and the traders profesFed to be following the
lpaderpliip of Insiders In their buying. How
ever this may be, it was evident that purely
fpcculative operations played a large part ln
the day's dealings as realizing sales came Into
fvldence In every caÂ«e where a considerable ad
vance was made, resulting ln f harp reactions.
Th^re was more or less realizing going on al'
<iay. the sustaining Influence of the strength
ln special f.ocks being availed of to take prufltb
ln the general lisa. The result of this Is seen ln
the net losses prevailing here aad there, some
cl them in important stocks. The principal
features of the news cf the day was the ex
cellent traffic returns of the railroads. Especl
aJly the Southwestern roadt-. the bituminous
roe.1 carriers and some of the Southern roads
r bowed a larce increase in their gross earnings
ever those of the correppondlng week of last
year. The eerrion of the miner*' convention
was perhaps the rau$e of the dullness and
Flight weakness ln the anthracite coai group
although confidence was expressed that no
strike was to be- feared. The continued low
rate for call loar.s neutralized the effect of the
df-pJetlon of the ca*h reserves of the banks by
thÂ« reaÂ«on of the drain to the Fubtreasury an-'
the growing demands from the Interior. A
r.umber cf the important movements of the
day were in the stocks ot minor railroad com
panies and rumcr was busy with stories of pro
jected consolidations to account for those ed
vanoes. The *<ocks of express companies,
which have be^n dormant, advanced- sharply
ever the last quotations. American Express
ro?e 3 and lost it; L'nited State* Express 414
and Adams Express 1Â«>4. The rtrenKth in
Tobacco was due to a belief in benefits to
accrue from reduced taxes. Amalgamated
Copper weaker.ed on reports of a renewal of
hostile project* in Montana. rh e smelting
etocks fell on the notice of appeal of the suit
aealftnt the absorption of the Guggenheim In
tereMs. The enumeration of yuch special In
fluence* might be considerably extended, but
the resulting price movement In other case*
was leps. although It extended from 1-to 2

CHICAGO, March 12.â May wheat opened
H@>4c higher at 75%c to 75%c under the short
lived support resultant to higher Liverpool
cables and the mildly bullish Government re
port made yesterday. There was a fair amount
of outside buying the first few minutes, but thÂ»
bulk of purchases was made by local thorts.
It was roon left to local bulls to take care
of the market and they proved unequal to th^
task, although- the bear pressure was at no
time severe or even serious. Considering the
divergent views expressed by leading traders
the comparative inactivity of the market Is a
puzzle. The bull arguments embracing recent
reductions in crop estimates for Argentine,
Australia. France and in the Northwest are
answered by pointing to the fact that May
wheat is now 9c higher than It was a year ago.
It was this answer which was made to thÂ«:
Government report. The market, without any
particular pressure, worked off during the
forenoon to 7l"^'075c, rallied during the after
noon to 75H'i/75 1 /Â»c. reacted to 74;4c and closed
easy, %c under yesterday at 7oc.
Corn was very active during the first hour
and higher on the Government report and un
settled weather. It became quiet later and
eased off somewhat. The close was M@'.ic
higher at 40Ti??41c for the May option.
Oats were more active and stronger thnn
usual In sympathy with corn. May closed, itc
higher at 24%624Â»ic.

NEW TORIC. March 12.â On the call the
market was easy, with prices 4Â®7 points lower
on present crop options and 3 points lower
to 1 point higher on next crop months. From
that level values went oft steadily up to the
noon hour. May reached 8.2Sc soon after mid
day under general selling, brought out by es
timates for large receipts to-morrow and re
ports that Southern spot cotton markets were
easing off under pressure from the Interior.
But before 2 p. m. a steady undertone ob
tained and somewhat hastily local shorts
turned for profits. This buying resulted In a
fharp rise In May to SHc, with other months
proportionately higher. The close was barfly
steady, with prices net 1@6 points lower.

were Republican. Had these gone to Mor
gan he would have been elected.
The run of John L. Davie for Mayor,
with no nomination, was one of the sur
prises of the campaign. Davie was gtven
scarcely more than 1000 votes by the po
litical wiseacres, yet he ran third with
2548 votes and was less than 400 behind the
leader In the race.
Looking Forward.
But so much for the election which Is
past. The ink on the election returns had
hardly dried before the future was being
discussed by the politicians, and the ef
fect that this election would have upon
the next State and county fights was be
ing figured out.
The men who figure politics as they do
a racing form chart take elections and
compute the possibilities of the future
upon the form of the past. Those who
are engaged in this Interesting if profit
less occupation say that this election will
cut more of a figure in State and county
politics than the mere possession of the
patronage of the city of Oakland would
indicate.
Dr. Gforgre C. Pardee and County As
sessor Henry P. Dalton were tacit If not
open supporters of the Municipal League
ticket, and to that extent this election
will affect the future. Dr. Pardee Is re
garded In Alameda County as an aspirant
for the nomination for Governor, and the
defeat of the Municipal League Board of
Public Works Is regarded as a blow to his
aspirations. It was recognized that Dr.
Pardee and Assessor Dalton were Inter
ested In the board fight, and particularly
in the success of W. A. Dow and M. K.
Miller. It Is the vote upon these candi
dates that Is regarded as significant.
Walter G. Manuel, the Municipal League
nominee for Mayor, was not particularly
friendly to the Dalton element in the Mu
nicipal League, and while he was given
the support of Dalton It was not because
of love, but because of necessity. Dalton
and Manuel separated over a fight In the
Third Ward two years ago and Manuel
was only accepted by Dalton because of
necessity. ,
So the political form chart makers are
figuring that this means a possible divi
sion in Alameda County on the question
of favored sons for high honors. The po
litical weather prophets are predicting po
litical contests In the future and the old
line Republicans are in complete control
of the city if they have lost the county
government.
What Will Happen.
There are all kinds of rumors In the air
as to what will happen. Nothing can be
done for a few weeks, for the new officials
cannot take office until the first of April,
and then will begin a reorganization of
the government.
The first branch that will be reorgan
ized will be the Board of Public Works
The first office that will be given out will
be the secretaryship of that body. The
straight Republicans will urge Rod W.
Church for that position, but Secretary
R F. Jackson Is a candidate to succeed
himself. As the secretary of the Board
of Public Works Is a sort of secretary to
the Mayor, It Is probable that Anson Bar
stow will be permitted to name the man.
Church would have been a candidate for
Those isew Wards.
City Clerk had the Council been Repub
lican, but will now be urged for secretary
of the Board of Public Works.
It la too early to talk about changes in
the various departments in detail, but the
most agitated department is the police
force. There are decided factions in this
department, divided upon political lines,
and that is where the agitation comes for
some of the members.
This election has developed some Inter
esting results In regard to the new ward
lines. The present City Council, which
is a Municipal League body, redlstrlcted
the city and practically redlstrlcted its
members out of office Instead of giving
themselves a m.ore complete hold upon the
vote.
The Third Ward, which has been a
Municipal League ward for ten years, ha3
now become old-line Republican by a de
cided majority. Tha Second Ward, which
has always been Municipal League, has
now become Republican. Instead of mak
ing the Fourth Ward Municipal League,
as It was endeavored to do by taking
in a section of tha old Third "Ward, it
more decidedly belongs to the old-line
party faction.
The only ward thit seems to retain Its
old-fashioned Municipal League character
is the Seventh, the lines of which were
not changed. The First Ward, which la
composed entirely of the annexed district,
has been an unknown quantity until the
present time, and It is now seen to be very
close between the Municipal League and
the Republicans.
The Fifth Ward, which was formerly
changes were In figures made by the few
missing precincts, but these did not alter
the results announced. The Republicans
hold complete control of the patronage of
the municipal government, and the Muni
cipal League holds control of the Council
by the very narrow margin of five votes
that elected Ruch over McMenomy In the
First Ward. While the complete control
of the Republicans in the Board of Pub
lic Works precludes any possibility of a
contest for the Mayoralty, which is the
only office connected with the Board of
Public Works that Is at all close, there
are several threats of contests In connec
tion with the City Council.
There is certain to be a contest In the First
Ward if the official count does not change
the newspaper returns. Ruch defeated
McMenomy by five votes on the face of
the returns, as carefully tabulated by the
newspaper bureau, and the work of this
organization was so careful and so nearly
perfect as to make It that the
official canvass by the City Council will
make any change. It can be said with
certainty that the courts will be appealed
to for a recount In this ward, and It is
said by the Republicans that McMenomy
will win by this recount. The Municipal
league controlled the election boards In
this district, and the officers were named
by Councilman Girard. and while no
charges of any nature are made by the
Republicans. It Is said that doubtful votes
were not counted to the credit of McMen
omy.
E. R. Allen. Republican nominee for
Ccuncllman at large, who ran sixth and
within 133 votes of George T. Burtchaell,
the Municipal League candidate at large,
who waa the lowest successful candidate,
threatens to contest the election of the
latter. C. H. Daly, the unsuccessful Mu
riclpal League candidate, has more votes
than Allen, but still less than Burtchaell.
Republican Victory.
The result Is a substantial Republican
victory, for It gives that party complete
control of the patronage of the city, and
while the Council Is Municipal League
ur-on its face, it is only by a very narrow
margin, and It would be Impossible upon
partv lines to muster enough votes to
override a veto by a Republican Mayor.
In addition th* Republicans capture seven
out of eleven School Directors.
Had It not been for a sudden case of
frigid pedal extremities upon the part of
seme Republicans they would have cap
tured the Treasurership. At the last mo
ment some Republicans began to fear that
C. B. Morgan, the Republican nominee for
Treasurer, might not be able to hold the
full strength of the party, and enough
votes were changed from Morgan to Bor
tree. the Democratic nominee, to defeat
Morgan and elect Felton Taylor on a
minority vote. Bortree ran 1300 ahead of
English, the Democratic nominee for
Mayor, and more than half of these votes

The Eleventh Cavalry will be mustered
out of the service to-day and the Thirty
sixth Infantry will be mustered 6\jt Satur
day. The men turned In their arms fÂ«v
eral days ago and have been doing soldier

the Tenth Infantry.
Orders have been issued calling for the
organization of the first battalion of the
Thirtieth Infantry. Captain Murphy and
Lieutenant Rethers have been detached
from duty with the Twenty-eighth and
assigned to the new organization. The
third squadron of the Fifteenth Cavalry
will also be organized. There are more

SAN* JOSE. March 12.â Dist-Ict Attorney
Bullock of San Mateo County was on the
witness stand all day in the Mansfleld-
O'Keefe libel suit. He wa3 given a rigid
cross-examination by Attorney Hlghton,
but his testimony was not shaken. AH In
all it showed that Judge Buck, Sheriff
Mansfield and the witness were not In tha
habit of enjoying mutual love feasts.
Attorney Richards made the opening
statement of defendant's case when court
was called this morning. He said the de
fense Intended to show that the charges
In the article published in the Redwood
City Times-Gazette criticizing Judge Buck
and Sheriff Mansfield were true.
District Attorney Bullock then took ths
stand. He had known Judge Buck and
Sheriff Mansfield for a number of years.
The only differences between them wer*Â»
of a political nature. The witness had
gone with Sheriff Mansfield to the scene
of the murder of the Johnson bov at Col
ma the morning following the crime.
They separated at the depot and started
In different directions to see what evidence
they could obtain against Desirello. They
were to report to each other, but the
Sheriff failed to do so and went to San
Francisco. Mansfield had not reported to
this day. and he gave no information to
assist at the Coroner's Inquest. The Dis
trict Attorney said that he had received
no assistance from the Sheriff In the pros
ecution of the case against Desirello. No
witnesses nor evidence had been produced.
At other times he had rendered valuable
assistance, went out of his way to do so.
but in the Desirello case he had done
nothing.
The witness said that Mansfield was
present at all times at the trial of De
sirello. Mrs. Mansfield sat beside Mrs.
Desirello and their seats were put directly
in front of the jury- The mother and
sister of the murdered hoy were put to
one side. When Mrs. Johnson and her
daughter had cried at the Introduction of
the pistol used in the murder Judge Buck
had ordered them to keep quiet or leavp
the court.
Bullock said that Mansfl>ld had come to
him after the publication of the article
In O'Keefe's paper and asked for a war
rant for O'Keefe's arrest. He advised
against this procedure. Finally he told
Mansfield he would see that the warrant
was Issued, but he would not prosecute it.
for he believed the article contained tho
truth.

WASHINGTON. March 12. â Caesar
Cflpo Moreno, for years a familiar char
erter on the streets about the Capitol,
died here to-day from a stroke of paral
ysis. Moreno had a picturesque and ad
venturous career. He had visited nearly
every civilized portion of the globe, and
rliiimf-d all the rulers as his friends. For
thÂ» past ten years he had led rather a
precarious existence in this city. Moreno
was a native of Italy, saw service In the
â¢ "rlmean war and while in Sumatra was
instrumental In a movement for inciting^
the natives to revolt against Holland.
I*ater he was sent to Tonquin by the
French Government in some capacity and
thence drifted to China, where he organ
ized the first steamship company under
the Chinese flag.
Shortly after the Civil War he landed
st San "Francisco and was successful In.
Fecurir.c the enactment of the Moreno
laws fty the protection of coast fisheries.
In 1-7:: he organized a trans-Pacific cable
company, in which Leland Stanford waa
ilnterested. and finally a charter was ob
â¢^inin^d from Congress for constructing a
cable estimated to cost J10.000.000. He
jigaln wont to the Orient and subsequent
ly to the Hawaiian Islands, where he
rairf-d the confidence of Kine Kalakaua.
The latter, angered at the refusals of the
Â«'abinet to approve a loan of $1,000,000 by
i!>- Hawaiian 'ioverr.ment for the pro
poyAd cable, dismissed the members and
selected four new councilors, Moreno be
ir.c f'ifFicnated as Prime Minister. Moreno
carried things with a high hand, and
sfter live <IÂ»ys of power was forct^d to
Five up the position.
He was still a favorite with the Klngr,
hoftgver. and the latter secretly commls
rioned him as Minister to the United
Ftates and every court in Europe, but
'hfso commissions were soon re%oked.
Up took three young Hawalians to Eu
rope to be educated, and about 1SS2 re
turned to America and had lived in Wash-

SANTA ROSA. March 12.â Mrs. Rose
Carico, who arrived here from St. Augus
tine. 111., a few days ago and at once
brought suit against her husband. Dr.
J. W. Carico of Cloverdale, for alimony,
etc., to "be paid during the progress of a
suit for divorce which she announced
soon would be commenced, started for
home tft-day. It Is understood the case
has been adjusted out of court. Yester
day Judge Burnett of the Superior Court
made an order granting her alimony of
$50 a month and $73 cash and attorney
fees.
The couple met in court to-day for the
first time in five years, but neither gave
any sign of recognition. The case has
caused much comment in Cloverdale,
where Dr. Carico has been practicing for
some time and was supposed to be an
unmarried man. In her complaint Mr5.
Carioo alleged that her husband deserted
her, but he maintained that she left him.

Judge Torrancs of San Diego Orders
the Release of Mrs.
Ramon.
SAN DIEGO, March 12.â Judge Tor
rance, by a decision to-day in the matter
of the habeas corpus petition of Eliza
beth Ramon, overrules the Supreme Court
as to the effect of a failure on the part of
a defendant in a misdemeanor case to
waive a trial by jury would have on what
ever judgment the court might render
upon conviction. â¢ '
In the case of Fife the Supreme Court
has held that the failure of the trial court
to give the defendant the opportunity to
demand or walve*a Jury trial amounted
to nothing more than an. error which
would form a basis for a motion for a
new trial and for an appeal.
Judge forrance holds that such a fail
ure on .the part of the Justice invalidates
the Judgment, and, despite the decision
of the Supreme Court, he ordered the re
lease of Mrs. Ramon on the writ. She
had been sentenced to serve six months
on the charge of battery committed en
another woman.
OVERRULES THE SUPREME
COURT OF THE STATE
RAN JOSE, March 12.â A discovery of
natural gas and oil, which, it Is believed,
will lead to developing these resources In
this valley," was made at the ranch of O.
P. Mills, on the San Felipe road, about
one and One-half miles easterly from Ev
ergreen. Two deep wells are being sunk
by the county for road purposes. At 10:30
this morning a fiepth of 300 feet had been
reached. A pit had been dug fifty-seven
feet and the men were at work in the
bottom of this. The sand pump brought
to the surface water deeply laden with oil
and a flow of natural gas set in. The
drill was sent down again and a light
colored clay and shale was penetrated
six feet, when the flow of gas became so
strong the men at work In the pit had
great difficulty in escaping without being
asphyxiated.
The bottom and sides of the pit were
soon thickly covered with oil. and the
How of gas increased, accompanied with a
gurgling and roaring sound. Ropes pow
ered were saturated with oil and burned
like a torch when lighted. Work had to
be suspended.
Oil experts have been sent for. These
oil indications are the best yet discov
ered in this valley, and It Is believed It
.will lead to a discovery of rich oil wella.
While boring a well on the place of Mrs.
J. Fleming, in the eastern foothills, about
six miles from this city, oil was struck at
a depth of 103 feet to-day. The Indications
are in the nature of a seepage and It is
believed that oil may be found deeper.
Considerable excitement was caused in the
vicinity by the find. The place is near
Alum Rock Park, where natural. gas and
strong indications of oil were recently dis
covered.

Mrs. . Lillian d'Ancona Goes Â¦â¢ to tho
Islands to Write About
.^ Ceremonies.
Mrs. Lillian d'Ancona leaves for Tahiti
this week on the steamer Australia to
prepare a report for some of the Eastern
magazines on the great celebration which
is to take place in the islands on July
U. She will write several articles, one
of them to cover the extensive prepara
tions now in progress, not only on fhe
Island of Tahiti itself, but throughout
the Society group and the neighboring
Inlands of the Marquesas.
The celebration is not only the cus
tomary biennial observance of- the French
fete dayâ the Islands being under the
control of Franceâ but it is -Â¦ recognized
as probably the last big one In which
the natives will feel free to have tho
full swing that has always been granted
to them hitherto by the French officials.
The establishment of the steamer con
nection with the United States Is chang
ing things in Tahiti and the Tahitians
realize that a little further time will ren
der their native pastimes, feasts and
mysteries too incongruous- to be permit
ted. Accordingly they are reported to be
getting ready on a grand . scale to turn
loose In all their old-time regalia.
It is expected â¢ that the result will be
.one of the most unique affairs that has
occurred in the Pacific 'Ocean for a num
ber of years. It is also thought that It
will be the last of the simon-pure native
feasts in the South . Pacific. Mrs. d'An
cona goes under commission from the
Arthur I. Street Magazine Company,
â¢which Is making use of some of her
articles written during a former trip to
Tahiti.
TAHITIANS PREPARE
FOR THEIR LAST FEAST
In an opinion overruling a demurrer In
tho action instituted by P. M. Wellln
against Superintendent of Schools R. H.
Webster for a writ of mandate to compel
the allowance of a demand for $30 "on ac
count of school repairs." Judge Sloss has
decided that the provision of the charter
relative to the repair of school buildings
supersedes the provisions of the Political
Code, "if there is any conflict." This de
cision, though Webster may join the is
sues by filing- answer. If so advised, means
practically a, Judgment in Wellln's favor
and establishes the right of the Board of
Public WortaJ and the Board of Educa
tion to direct the matter of repairs under
the provisions of the charter.
In his opinion Judge Sloss says:
"The real controversy seems to arise on
the question of whether the provisions of
the charter relative to the repair of school
buildings are in conflict with the provi
sions of the constitution of this State.
"In 'municipal affairs' the charter su
persedes general laws. If the erection of
schoolhouses 'falls within the function of
a municipal government' the alteration
and repair Â¦ of t'uch schoolhouses when
erected is equally a matter of 'municipal
concern.' I conclude, therefore, that the
provision of. the charter relative to the
repair of school buildings are controlling 1
as against the provisions of the Political
Code. The demurrer is therefore over
ruled." - :.â¢Â¦Â¦.â¢'â¢,â¢
&LOSS HOLDS CHARTER
GOVERNS SCHOOL REPAIRS
Decides in Overruling a Demurrer
That Its Provisions Supersede
Political Code. - ;
That on the evening of the said 21st day
of February, 1901, the said steamship arrived
within three miles of the entrance of the port
of San Francisco and encountered a heavy tog
and anchored at the entrance of the said har
bor within two miles of the shore of the city
end county of San Francisco, State of Cali
fornia, and was lying safely at anchor; that
thereafter, on the morning of the next day,'
between the hours of midnight and 5 o'clock,
the sea being calm and no wind blowing, the
said steamer, still lying safely at anchor, it
being yet dark and a heavy tog still continu
ing to envelop the said ship, under the order
of the captain of the said steamship her an
chor was raised and she steamed from her Bald
safe anchorage and attempted to enter the
eftid port of San Francisco; that the entrance
to- said port isr a narrow channel, surrounded
by sunken rocks and reefs and fraught with
strong and varying currents; that the said
attempt 'to enter the said harbor at' the said
time and in the said fog was gross neRlljrence
on the part of the captain of the said vessel
and of the Pacific Mall Steamship Company;
that during- the said attempt to enter the said
r.arbor, and by reason thereof, the said steam
ship was run upon a rock and foundered, and
the said Henry Guyon. being then upon the
oaid steamship, alive and able-bodied, was car
ried with her below the waters and was
drowned.
The complaint further charges gross
negligence on the part of the defendant
in failing to take the necessary soundings;
that the crew consisted of ignorant Chi
namen, Imperfectly acquainted with the
English language, and were therefore un
able to understand the orders of the of
ficers; that there was abundant time after
the ship struck to . have launched the
boat3, but that owing to the aforesaid
Ignorance of the crew but two of the
boats were launched: that the steamship
company failed to provide a full comple
ment of licensed officers to. manage the
ship, or officers who could speak the lan
guage of the crew.
The sum of $25,000 is asked for as dam
ages for the loss of Mr. Guyon's life and
$525 for the loss of his personal effects.; .
Gavin McNab and William Denman are
attorneys for Mrs. Guyon.
The allegations of the complaint are;
Mrs. Sarah Guyon, as administratrix of
the estate of Henry Guyon, drowned by
the wrecking of the Rio de Janeiro, filed
a libel suit yesterday in the United States
District Court against the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company for $25,525 damages.
The heirs are Mrs. Sarah Guyon, Ernest
Guyon, aged 15 years; Milton Guyon, aged
11 yaars. and Eldred Guyon, aped 5 years.
The Railroad Commissioners have de
cided to make the Southern Pacific and
the Santa Fe Railroad companies explain
on or before April 10 why the railroad
companies cannot furnish more cars.
The Southern Pacific Company is at
present constructing some wooden tank
cars to be used for hauling oil, but ex
perienced oil men claim that they will be
a failure and a menace. The Santa Fe
people claim that they furnish all the oil
cars they can.
The oil men of Bakersfleld, Kern, Sun
set and various other oil localities have
petitioned the -Railroad Commissioners to
investigate the present high charges that
they pay for transporting oil. The mat
ter will be taken up on April 10.
The oil men of the Kern River district
filed yesterday, a formal complaint with
the Railroad Commissioners in which they
claim that they are severely handicapped
and are at great financial loss owing to
the lack of cars in which to move oil.
In the complaint the petitioners assert
that they have developed the Kern River
district with a great outlay of money and
energy: that the land was practically val
ueless two years ago, and that It Is now
very valuable. They say that their busi
ness is practically at a standstill, many
of the wells being closed, the storage ca
pacity being filled and there being no cars
on hand to move the product to the mar
ket. . The oil consumers are cut off with
their supply of fuel, all owing to a lack
of cars.
The petitioners request the Railroad
Commissioners to take the matter up at
once.
Lack of Transportation Has
Brought Business to a
Standstill.

GOYON'S WIDOW
WANTS DAMAGES
IT IS not often that a bride and groom
spend their . honeymoon on a United
States vessel. Captain and Mrs. H. K.
Struve had that honor. They were
married in Manila and came home on
the Hancock, arriving yesterday morning.
It was a case of love at first sight and
the officers on the Hancock call the court
ship "The Romance of a Transport."
The bride was formerly Miss Florence
M. Boruck, daughter of the late Marcus
D. Boruck, at one time proprietor of tho
Spirit of the Times, and private secretary
to Governor Waterman. The groom is
Captain Harry K. Struve. master of the
transport Hancock, a most careful and
skillful navigator and one of the best
known and best-liked men on the Pacific
The romance began in April, 1900. At
Campbell has been on one of the over
land trains and his run has been from
this city to Ogden. The last trip he made
was two weeks ago. He has been Buffer
ing from the effects of a severe cold and
recently has been unable to sleep or
eat. He frequently complained of his
condition and appeared to be depressed.
Shortly after lunch yesterday Campbell
went upstairs and his mother and sister3
thought he had gone to his room. When
he did not reappear at 5:30 o'clock, one of
his sisters, Miss Annie Campbell, detected
the odor of gas and tried the bathroom
door. Finding it barred she secured a
ladder and looked in throuch a window.
She was startled to see her brother's
lifeless body hanging over the edge of the
tub with the throat cut from ear to ear.
The gas jet in the room was also open
and It is supposed that Campbell pro
vl4ed for the gas to end his life in the
event the razor failed to do Its deadly*
work.
Charles P. Campbell, a Wells-Fargo
mesenger. 55 years of age, committed
suicide at his residence, 1264 Jackson
street, yesterday afternoon. The unfor
tunate man first turned on. the gas and
then resting his head over a bathtub cut
his throat. Despondency from illness is
supposed to have been the cause of his
act.

GAS AND A RAZOR
BRING HIM DEATH
The body was taken to Oakland last
night, but no definite arrangements have
yet been made for the funeral. Remillard
was unmarried. He was a popular club
man, well read, traveled and a social fa
vorite. His death will leave a blank not
easily filled. -â¢.Â¦Â¦Â«â¢:Â»Â¦
The Coroner and a jury viewed the re
mains yesterday afternoon, and the in
quest will be hdd on Thursday morning,
commencing at 10 o'clock. Dr. L. D. Bacl

Remillard's death to be due to the frac
ture of the base of the skull and to in

cry only twenty-four hours before his
death. He spoke cheerfully and did not
complain of unbearable pain. During the
night, however, a change for the worse
set in; followed by unconsciousness.
James V. Coleman. the well-known club
rnan and capitalist, is seriously ill at his
rooms in the Savoy Hotel. A few weeks
ago Mr. Coleman had an attack of the
prip and later pulmonary symptoms set
In. which confined him to his bed at once.
For the last two weeks Mr. Coleman's
physicians and nurses have been in con
stant attendance, and the gravest appre
hension has been felt in regard to his re
covery.
Yesierday Mr. Coleman's condition
F^pmtd a little better and he was able to
take more rest than usual. His physi
cians stated that he was improving and
that they had strong hopes that he might
be able to be out once more In a few
â¢werks. The patient Is still dangerously
111. however, and the greatest care and at
tendance will have to bu exercised to pre
clude the possibility of a relapse. Mr.
Coleman Is very anxious about his many
business enterprises and feels reluctant to
forego the personal supervision of his af
fair?, even for a brief period. The con-
Ftant aim of ncth physicians and nurses
is to keep him frw from worry, as it is
felt that the weight of business cares
would impede his recovery. The chief
trouble with the patient at present is a
decided weakness, which does not disap
pear as rapidly as would ordinarily be ex
pected.

SERIOUSLY ILL
ON Saturday night Philip H. Rcmil
lard, vice president of the Remil
lard Brick Company, clubman
nr-.n bon-vivant, acted as host at
a pleasant dinner in the Delmor.i
co restaurant. He stepped to the win
dow, his laugh still ringing in the ears
of his guests, to get a breath of fresh air.
The story of his misstep and awful fall
has been told. Yesterday morning he dieJ
In the Waldeck Sanatorium from his in
juries, his mother and sister being by his
Bide when he passed away. He spoke no
parting word to them, for he was uncon
scious.
The end was a shock. The injured man
seemed to be in a fair way toward recov-
Jlrs. Struve is a handsome brunette,
with a very winning manner, while her
liustnnd Is one of the finest specimens of
manhood in the transport service. Mrs.
Struve is delighted with the Philippines,
and hts tho hardihood to say that she
would sooner live- In Manila than San
Francirco. Mrs. Boruck boarded the
Hancock as soon as the vessel came to an
anchor, and eient the entire day with her
daughter en the transport.
that time Miss Bomck was living with
her mother at W5 Sutter street. When the
1'hillppine Commission was sent out the
members tvâ¬re assigned to the Hancock,
and Miss Boruck went along with the
v/ife of one -of the commissioners. Cap
tain Struve learned to love on the trip to
Manila, but was afraid to declare himself.
Once in the Philippines and noticing the
number of sick and the scarcity of nurses
Miss Boi uck offered her services, which
were at once accepted. Every time the
Hancock returned to Manila, Captain
Struve called upon Miss Boruck, and
finally succeeded in winning her consent
to a marriage when the Hancock returned
to Manila. The outward run was made in
mcoi'd time, and the transport reached
Manila about the middle of January. On
January 30. 1901. Captain Harry K. Struvo
and Mies Florence M Boruck were made
one, and a week or so later were on their
way back to San Francisco. Thus ended
the "Romance of a Transport" In the way
which all good romances should end.

Mayor Phelan thought that the Attorney
General might be induced to bring suit
to have the charters forfeited. The dis
cussion was of a desultory nature, and no
definite action was taken.
Commissioners Wallace and Newhall
voted for Begley's dismissal, while.Com
missioner Mahoney favored a heavy fine.
After the meeting adjourned the Com
missioners met Mayor Phelan and inform
ally discussed the eight-hour law for the
management of the department.
The Mayor said that he had been in
formed by prominent attorneys that the
Henry act is a nullity. "Under the cir
cumstances," said he, "this board should
not pay any attention to it."
Newhall said that ha was In favor of
working the men only eight hours out of
twenty-four If It could be so arranged.
"To make the change with our present
force," said he, "would reduce the police
protection in the outlying districts."
Mayor Phelan gave it as his belief that
after all the soldiers leave here, which
will not be later than June, many patrol
men could be taken from the outlying dis
tricts. He further suggested that when
the commission asks for an appropriation
from the Supervisors for the coming fiscal
year that a large increase be demanded
in order that more men may be appointed.
The matter of closing the Chinese gam
bling house? was not considered. Com
missioner ICewhall believed that steps
should be taken to have the charters of
the Chinese clubs revoked.
Patrolman John J. Begley was dis
missed from the department for disobedi
ence of orders and smokine while on
duty. Begley was detailed on the night
of the Hawkins-McFadden fight at the
Mechanics' Pavilion to stand guard over
the Harrison Primary School on Grove
street, between Larkin and Polk. Com
plaint was made that on several other oc
casions when contests were in progress at
the Pavilion the schoolhouse was broken
into by men and boys, who expected to
be able to view the fight from the upper
floors. Begley, in disobedience of orders,
made his way into the Pavilion and was
enjoying the flght from the gallery when
Sergeant Duke found him. The sergeant
testified that Begley was smoking, but he
denied that charge. , 7. Â¦
Patrolman Thomas F. Flynn was tried
and acquitted on a charge of unofflcerlike
conduct and neglect of duty. Tony Pedro,
employed as superintendent of teams by
Gray Bros., contractors, claimed that
Flynn had failed to arrest the driver of a
lumber team who was abusing one of
their teamsters. The evidence for the
prosecution failed to show that Flynn had
failed in his duty and the charge was
promptly dismissed.
The Police Commissioners at a meeting
held last night appointed W. 'J. Kava
nagh and George K. Small regular patrol
men. The new appointees were taken
from the civil service list. They were or
dered to appear before Chief Sullivan at
10 o'clock this morning to be sworn In and
instructed as to their duties.

When telling her story Mrs. Buckley
expressed the belief that her daughter
had met with foul play. :. f
The police are puzzled over the mys
terious disappearance of Miss Julia Buck
ley, who, until two weeks ago, resided
with her parents at 237 Minna street. The
young lady Is 21 years of age. Yesterday
the mother received a message that her
daughter had been injured, but the sender
of tho message cannot be located. The
fear Is expressed that the young lady has
met with foul play. â¢ Â¦ ;Â¦ '.Â¦-Â¦â¢â¢"Â¦Â¦Â¦
Two weeks ago Sunday Miss Buck
ley left her home in the afternoon
and did not return in the evening. At
lirst Mrs. Buckley thought that her
daughter had gone to stop at the house
of a friend, and it was not until after a
week had passed that she became ex
tremely alarmed.
The mother's fears were increased yes
terday afternoon when she received a
telephone message that her daughter had
been injured. When she asked for par
ticulars the man sending the information
simply said that his name was "Coak
ley and hung up the receiver. Mrs.
Buckley then visited all the hospitals In
the city, but not finding her daughter
called at police headquarters and asked
that detectives be detailed on the case.
