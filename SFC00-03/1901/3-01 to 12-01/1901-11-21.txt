THOUSANDS HEAR MADAME CALVE AS "CARMEN"
AND GREET THE DIVA WITH HEARTIEST ENTHUSIASM
SCENE OF STAGE AND AUDIENCE IN GRAND OPERA-HOUSE AND PRINCIPALS WHO APPEARED LAST NIGHT IN BIZET'S "CARMEN."
BIG HOUSE IS FILLED
TO FULL CAPACITY
Brilliant Scene Created by the
Gathering of Hundreds of
Fashion's Throng.
SAX nUUROOO saw and heard
a new "CarmT." last night at
the Grand Opera-house. It was
the "Carmen"' idealized by Pros
per de Merimee in his famous
fiovel, around which Bizet wrote his en
trancing music, with the exception of the
last act, which a friend added to the
after the composer died.
What need to tell of how Minnie Hauk
or Zelia de Lussan interpreted the char
acter of the wayward cigarette girl of
Spain or compare the subtle art of
Madame Calve with other contraltos who
have sung in the opera.
Society cared not one Jot for the rain.
Calve was to sing "Carmen," and San
Francisco was to hear the diva whose
fame has thrilled two continents. Four
thousand people, representing all classes
of society, sat in the Grand Opera-house
and listened to Calves singing and
Â¦watched her acting.
The 4000, and not the "Four Hundred,"
rendered a unanimous? verdict that Calve
1b the greatest "Carmen" of all. Those
who came expecting to see a melodra
matic rendition of the role rubbed their
eyes when they saw the graceful and
â¢womanly impersonation of the Calve.
"Can this be the singer about whom the
capitals of Europe and the large Ameri
can cities have gone into ecstacies? " was
asked by the skeptics after the first act.
Presents a Womanly "Carmen."
But these MK-tMM skeptics were the
leaders of the applause In the reception
accorded Calve wh< n the curtain descend
ed on the succeeding acts. The womanly
and human side of the character of Car
men shown by tie diva. There was
no playing to the gallery by wild rushes
around the stage; ther<Â» was none of the
Â¦wanton abandon in the enactment that is
often mistaken for art.
Calvf laid bare the emotions of Car
men s heart and touched a responsive
chord in the breasts of th<> vast audience.
Artistic from the tip of ncr toes to the
top of her dainty head, she held that au
dience spellbound, except at such times
man nature could not restrain Itself,
when the people burst forth into applause
in the midst of scenes.
Although the rain was descending In <
The San Francisco Call.
torrents at 6 p. m., a line of men and
women had gathered at the Grand Opera
house to secure admission to the thea- i
ter. Every seat had been sold days in j
advance, and the house could have been j
sold over again so great was the demand.
Everything at last night's performance
went as merry as a marriage bell. Al
though the audience was as laree as
the one that greeted Eames and Sembrich
on Tuesday night, there was not a sign
of confusion, thanks to the excellent work
of Captain of Police Spillane and his
squad of bluecoats.
Excellent Handling of Crowd.
Those who desired to secure standing
rocm In the opera house were compelled
to form in a long line, that reached from
the box office out into the street and
half way along Mission street to Third.
The awnings protected those in line from^
the rain and the center of the lobby was
kept perfectly clear for holders of seats
in the theater.
At 7 p. m. the first of the carriages ar
rived and deposited their burdens under
the awnings in front of the theater. From
that hour until 8 o'clock the line of car
riages reached along Mission street for
three blocks.
There was an elaborate display of
gowns in the foyer of the opera house
previous to the performance. The dresses
intended for the second night of the sea
son, when Calve was to have appeared,
had been kept in reserve for last evening.
"Whpn Conductor Flon started the or
chestra the audience was nearly all seat
ed and the wraps that had concealed the
creations of the modistes were laid aside.
The house presented as brilliant an ap
pearance as it did on the opening night
of the season and on other gala evenings.
The boxes were filled with elaborately
gowned women. Rows: on rows of the or
chestra and dress circk displayed all va
rieties of evening dresses, and in the top
galleries there was a mass of color. Men
prominent in all walk.* of life, and thob^
not so well known, accompanied the fair
members of their fan-flies to the opera
house, riot to be present because it was

OPERA RENDITION
DELIGHTS HEARERS
Entire Cast Sings Familiar Music in
Manner That Delights the
Most Critical.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
WHEN Calve first sang |
"Carmen" for the di
rector of an opera house
in Paris, with the par
ticular illumination of
some other discoverers of genius, he dub
bed her conception of the character heter
odoxâwhich it happily wasâinartistic
well, is it?â and generally impossible. An
other clever soul advised the director to
permit the rash creature to sing h,er "Car
men" for the Parisian public that it might
teach her to repent her temerity in up
setting all recognized standards of inter
pretation of the famous role. And the
rash creature did sing the role for a week
and certainly did learn things thereby,
but not quite what the director had in
contemplation. At the week's end kIM j
was famous throughout Paris, and now is
the greatest Carmen of the day anywhere.
Last night, in spite of the rain and
storm, a huge audience gathered to hear
the Calve Carmen at the Grand Opera
house, and not least interested among
the spectators were Estefania Collama
rini and Signor Russo, the Carmen and
Dor Jose of the late Tivoli -Carmen."
Presumably everybody in the house had
heard Collamarini in the part, comment
and comparisons flying thick and fast ai!
over the house in the entr'actes, for
there are those who hold the two singers
may be compared.
It was a superb piece of generosity on
the part of Mme. Calve to sing at all on
such a night, as she had very evidently
not (lulte recovered from her cold, and
she may therefore not be finally judged
by her last evenings effort. She was
forced to save her voice at times, and
only occasionally attempted a vocal cii
niax. But Calve is all and more than one
has dreamed of her.
From the moment she comes on the
stage, slow-stepping, like a cat, lithe, sin
uous, luxuridus, her costume a riot of
reds, greens, yellows, artfully unlike the
other cigarette girls' gowns only in its
greater lawlessness, one feels in the pres
ence of the great artist. As one looks at
her she impresses as some strange,
heavily perfumed exotic; as a flaming ti
ger-lily; her sensuous grace of movement

having something of the sway and lift
of flowers in the wind. Her facial play ia
marvelous, and the first glance of her
half-shut eyes magnetizes one into com
plet# subjection. But then there are her
hands, with which, by some sublimated
sort of Delsarte, Calve enchains those
whom her eyes have not already en
slaved, and the last man capitulates to
the brilliant intellect behind the whole.
Calves Carmen <s an incarnation of
lawlessness, of the ""Why not?" to every
deed where fickle impulse points. She
indulges each momentary passion, not so
much for the passion's as for freedom' 3
sake; and not all the king's horses and
all the king's men can keep her faithful
(spasmodically) after the Impulse has
gone. Better than ar<y Carmen I ever
hope to see, Calve lives out the weird
leit-motif that winds in and about the
part from the overture to the closing
tragedy. Her conception has the 3anio
bizarre. Oriental strain, subtle and vivid,
and one feels the Ml or her inevitable
fate winding about her from the very be
ginning. It la the Carmen of Prosper
Merimee, the Carmen of Bizet, and a
world type.
She is beautiful, but one does not think
of it: her voice at its best is a glorious,
rich contralto, modulated exquisitely, and
one hardly thinks of that, but it is the
whole thing that leaves a never-to-be-for
gotten and unique impression. Viva
Calve!
Salignac sang and acted the part of
Don Jose most competently, and Suzanne
Adams scored as Mlcaela. The rest of
the parts were all acceptably taken, and
the orchestra was in good, but has been
in better form, in Mr. Flon's hands.
Scotti was the Toreador and sang with
a fire and sparkle that even he has never
surpassed. He was effusively -encored hi
the favorite "Toreador Song," and re
sponded to the delight of the house. Tho
applause, at first not enthusiastic, later
grew effusive, and in the second act and
in Calves superb acting in the card scene
ro3e to an ovation. The opera will ba
repeated to-morrow niÂ£ht, and It is hopeu
the diva will be completely recovered by
then and able to do herself fullest justice.2

Patronage.
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â The hunters and
jumpers, Shetlands, trotting stallions and
roadsters divided the interest and shared
the honors to-day at the Horse Show.
I The morning crowd was larger than usual
and the spectacular performance of the
jumpers, which were sent over six suc
cessive hurdles, each five feet high, was
probably the special attraction. There
were twenty-seven entries in that class.
After them came a big band of horses
suitable to become hunters. The Shetlands
followed with four classes shown. After
j them were the trotting stallions. George
I Peabody Wetmore ana John G. Hecksher
Â¦ were the ring committee for the day and
! Cornelius Feilowes and A. Newbold Mor
ris were named to officiate to-night.
The day was clear and sufficiently chlll

STUDENTS FIRE
ON THE POLICE
University Men in Athens
Engage in Serious
Riots.
ATHENS. Nov. 20. -The agitation of the
university students against the proposal
to translate the Gospels into modern
Greek has resulted, during the past two
days, in riotous demonstrations against
two newspapers which have been advocat
ing such translations.
To-day the students fired on the police.
Troops were then summoned and a serious
fight occurred, which resulted in the
wounding of a score of cavalrymen and
several students.
A political motive connected with the
Slav propaganda in Greece underlies this
religious movement.
The university is guarded to-night by
the students, who fear the building will
be occupied by the civil authorities.
of the Republican candidates for State
offices, with the exception of Judge Pratt,
appealed immediately from the decision
of the State Contest Board and a Demo
cratic court of appeals sustained the seat
ing of the Democratic claimants. Pratt
waited until the political complexion of
the higher court changed.

the "proper thing to d-.-," but to hear the
great Calve.
When the audience was seated those
having general admission tickets were al
lowed to rill the space behind the last
rows of seats, tnd two i*ollee officers saw
that the aisles were kept clear.
When Calve first came on the stage
she was given a rousing reception. When
the curtain went down there was a vol
ume of applause that swept' from every
part of the house, and up went the cvi -
tain, disclosing Calve with her associate
artists. Again and again she was called
for by the audience, anj received In all
eight mighty rounds of plaudits.
Collamarini came In with the tenor
Russo during the Interval and they took
seats In the center of the house. Oper<i
glasses were leveled at the pair on all
sides, and Sybil Sanderson and Gadski
also "peeped" at the -.Â«o singers who re
cently created a furor in Bizet's opera.
The gorgeous gowns and shawrs worn
by Calve in the second and fourth acts i
were commented on by the ladles in the j
audience while promenading the upper i
foyer and visiting friends in various
Dox-?s.
The men gathered in groups in the
lobby and on all sides the superb art of
Calve was the theme of conversation.
"Flower oÂ£ Msfeiy Generations."
A pretty story about Calve was told by
one of the Grau singers who was in the
audience. To a group of society men he
was telling of her career and recounted
how some years ago a banquet was given
in honor of the diva in the little town of
Rodez, in the South of France, near the
place where *he was born. One of the
guests at the banquet visited Calve'o
father, a hale and hearty peasant, about
80 years old. He told the singer's father
of the honor accorded his daughter on the
previous evening.

In speaking of his daughter Calves
father said to his Interviewer: You see
thosÂ« rose trees out there. Most or tnem
are covered with blossoms, but Â«ere la
one tree which bears but one rose, it naa
spent all Its strength in producing one
perfect blossom. That is the history oc
my daughter and her ancestors. She is
the supreme flower of generations."
Th.ise who listened to Calve' 3 singingf
last night agreed that the singer Is Indeed
the -supreme flower" of the present
musical generation.

PLANNING NEW
RAILWAY ROUTE
Southern Pacific Has a
Great Project in
View.
May Build From Summit
Through Grass Valley
to Marysville.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TRrCKEE. Nov. 20.-That the South
ern Pacitic is determined to reduce the
elevation, the grades, the curves at great
expense of its present high line over the
Sierras from Truckee to Colfax is evi
denced by the fact that another party of
engineers has taken the field to run pre
liminaries for a cut-off, including a tun
nel. They are now at work on a new line
to begin at Dormer Lake, with the inten
tion of coming out on the Yuba River
near Cisco. By the new tunnel the line
will be reduced eight miles and the ele
vation reduced 1000 feet. The tunnel will
have to be six miles in length and three
years will be required' to bore it.
There is another important feature in
this work and that is a new line from
some point on the main line in the Sierras
to Marysville. An electric line is being
built from Grass Valley and Nevada
City to Marysville, and it is the evident
intention of the Soutnern Pacific to kill
several birds with one stone, i. c., to build
a better line over the Sierras to reach
the famous mines in and around Grass
Valley and to build a direct line to Marys
ville from its present line in Eastern Cali
fornia.
Nowadays one rides down the mountain
from Summit to Colfax and from Colfax a
narrow-gauge train laboriously climbs
back again to Grass Valley. It is be
lieved that an easy grade can be secured
direct from the summit, to be determined
by the new survey, to Grass Valley and
thence by an easy route to Marysville.
The Dormer Lake route is probably over
the old emigrant trail and the lake itself
marks a spot which will always be
prominent in the history of those' who
pioneered the way from the Missouri
River to the Pacific, for at one end of the
lake the ill-fated Dormer party perished.
The snowsheds. a constant source of ex
pense and annoyance, will be obliterated,
but the scenic features wu. be enhanced,
for to-day the glorious scenery of the
Sierras is lost, as the snowsheds 'shut out
the view and it is not until the lower al
titude is reached that the passenger may
enjoy the sublime picture around Dutch
Hat, Cape Horn and Colfax.

BURGLARS LEAVE
NO CLEW BEHIND
Santa Rosa's Marshal Is
Now Figuring Up
His Loss.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 20.-Mystery still
shrouds the robbery of the City Marshal's
office yesterday morning, when more than
$I^oo of city tax money was taken from
the safe. Marshal Holmes is working dil
igently to ascertain the exact shortage,
but has not yet completed his search.
The amount taken, Mr. Holmes now be
lieves, will reach $1300. No balance has
been taken since the commencement or"
the collection of taxes, and for this rea
son the computation is slow.
The robbers must have been very quick
at their work. Not more than twenty
minutes could have been consumed by
them in getting into the office and open
ing the safe. At 5:25 o'clock the carrier
boy of the local morning daily left a pa
per at the Marshal's office and he says
the window blind was up and the gas was
burning, with no evidence of anything
wrong. At 6:05 o'clock the janitress ar
rived and found the gas out, the window
curtain down and the front door open.
A set of false whiskers were found by
Charles Staley yesterday morning in front
of the Marshal's office, and these are be
lieved to have been the disguise of one of
the thieves. A number of citizens who
\f-re out early in the morning saw
strange men in the vicinity of the city
hail, and the officers are trying to learn
v.ho these strangers were. Marshal
H"lmes is under an official bond of $40,000,
Issued by the T'nited States Fidelity and
Guarantee Company.

SEVEN MEN PERISH AND A SCORE
ARE INJURED IN CRASH OF TRAINS
Alleged Disobedience of Orders by the Crew of a Santa Fe Limited
Results in an Appalling Railway Disaster Twenty
Miles East of The Needles.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20.â Seven
men were killed and a score in
jured in a wreck on the Santa Fe
Railroad one mile west of Fran
conia, Ariz., a switching station
twenty miles east of The Needles, Cal.,
at 5:15 o'clock this morning. Limited
trains, east and west bound, Nos. 4 and 3 J
respectively, crashed together while run
ning at full speed. Train No. 4 was drawn
by two engines, while the westbound
train had but one locomotive. The three
engines were crushed and blown to pieces
by an explosion that followed the colli
sion. Both trains were made up of vesti
bule cars of the heaviest and most im
proved pattern and, while they stood the
terrible shock well and protected the pas
sengers to a great extent, several of the
cars took fire at once and burned. The
dining carsâ one on each train â one Pull
man and two composite cars were de
stroyed.
West-Bound Crew to Be Blamed.
The collision is said to have been due
to a disregarding of orders on the part
of the crew of the westbound limited,
though full particulars on this point are
as yet lacking. From, all accounts, how
ever, it Is gathered that the eastbound
train had orders to take the siding at
Franconia and await the passing of the
westbound flyer, which was running two
hours late and trying to make up time.
The eastbound train failed to reach the
siding and, as the westbound train did
not wait for it, the two came together
without warning and with an awful crash.
The boiler of the westbound train is said
to have exploded immediately after the
j crash, scalding to death those of the en
gine crews who had not been killed out
right. The bodies of Case and Armitage,
firemen of train No. 4, and Samuel
Brown, a waiter of train No. 3, are miss
j ing and it is believed they were cremated
in the conflagration that followed the col*
lision.
Confusion followed the crash. The mas
sive engines were piled up in an inde-
I scribable mass of broken and twisted
i steel, while the scalding steam hung in
a dense, suffocating cloud over the de
bris, from which came the agonizing cries
of the injured and dying enginemen. Tne
heavy Pullmans and composite cars
I jammed the dining and baggage cars up
on the heated pile of wreckage, crushing
out the lives of the dining car crews and I
setting the' cars afire.
Passengers Are Fortunate.
The sleeping cars, with one or two ex
ceptions, suffered slightly, and, as a re
sult, the passengers were afforded com
parative immunity from injury. So far as
learned only three passengers suffered in
' juries of a severe character, the terrible
results 'of the wfreck being confined al
most entirely to the train crews and the
employes of the dining car service.
As soon as the news of the wreck
reached The Needles, which is the divi
Â¦ sion headquarters of the west end, a re
i lief train was made up and, carrying a
' number of physicians from that point,
| was hurried to the scene. The injured
I were placed aboard and started west for
j Los Angeles.
Running Contrary to Orders.
At Santa Fe headquarters in Los An
! geles it was said that the blame had not
been definitely fixed, but, from all ap
pearances, it rests with the crew of the
' westbound train. Had the train stopDed
I at Franconia and allowed the eastbound
train to reach there, as the orders are
paid to have read, there would have been
no collision. For some reason, yet to be
learned, however, it came on at full speed
and the two trains met one mile west of
I the switch where it was intended they
RAIN AROUSES
NO COMPLAINT
Farmers Profit by the
Wetting Their Land
Receives.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 20.â Rain has
teen falling steadily for thirty-six hours.
In the vicinity of Sacramento the pre
cipitation is .60 of an Inch. â¢ Reports
from points along the river indicate a
general downpour. Nothing has been in
jured by the rain. Grapes and beans
have all been gathered. The present rain
is what farmers likeâ a gentle, soaking
drizzle that penetrates the soil without
causing streams to overflow. This rain
will start the plows in all parts of the
Sacramento Valley.
WOODLAND, Nov. 20.â The weather
has been showery all day. The rainfall
to date for the season hae been 2.63
inches, which is in excess of that of last
season at this time. Summer fallowed
land, needed before the showers, looks
well, and the ground is in fine condition
for winter plowing and sowing.
STOCKTON, Nov. 20.â The rainfall up
to midnight amounted to .46, making 2
inches for the season. Rain is still fall
ing, and the indications are for more.
The damage to late crops is light and
will be greatly exceeded by the benefits.
FRESNO, Nov. 20.â Rain commenced
falling at 9:30 o'clock to-night. If it
should develop into a heavy downpour it
will greatly benefit early sown grain and
pasturage. Farmers are hoping for a
soaking rain to aid them in their plowing.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 20.â The sky is clear
here and there are no signs of rain. A
good storm would be welcome to farmer's,
although it is not actually needed.
NAPA, Nov. 20.â Five and threa hun
dredths inches of rairi fell here during ihe
forty-eight hours ending at 7 o'clock this
morning. There were sÂ»nowers during the
day and to-night it is raining hard.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 20.â A light rain has
been falling here since 7 o'clock to-night.
At 10 o'clock the measurement was .01 of
an inch.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20.â The weather
here to-night is clear and pleasant, with
no indications of rain.
gANTA CRUZ, Nov. 20.â A heavy rain
fell here this evening, with prospects for
continuing all night.
King's Health Is Excellent.
LONDON, Nov. 20.â Sir Frederick
Treves, surgeon to King Edward, when
submitting the toast to the King at a
banquet at Aberdeen yesterday, said it
was pleasant to know that his Majesty
had never enjoyed such excellent health
as at present.

Survivors Tell of the Horrors of The
Needles Disaster.
SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 20.â The spe
cial train made up at the scene of the
Santa Fe wreck east of The Needles this
morning arrived in this city at 11:10
o'clock to-night with the injured members
of the train crew and the passengers who
were westbound. The latter escaped al
most without a scratch, and, marvelous
as it seems, of the thirty or more persons
who were coming to California on this
limited train not one has more than slight
bruises to show for his awful experience.
Conductor Higgins of The Needles, who
was in charge of No. 4 and who was fa
tally injured, had a sinking spell just as
the train pulled into the yards here and it
was believed he was dying, but he was
still breathing as the train left for Los
Angeles, a few. moments later. He Is in

is badly burned. Dr. Booth of The Nee
OFFICIAL'S BOOKS
SHOW SHORTAGE
County Recorder J. M.
Kerr of Fresno in
Difflcultie%
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Nov. 20. â County Recorder J.
M. Kerr is $1300 short in his accounts.
The discovery of the defalcation was
made yesterday by County Expert
Stephen Arthor, who has been going over
the books. The diversion of public funds
from the county treasury was made on
two occasions. On the Ist of January
the County Recorder should have de
posited with Treasurer Marshall about
$3800. Instead of turning in that sum he
withheld $1000. During one month since
then the amount placed in the treasury
b" the Recorder was $300 less than the
sum his books showed should have been
deposited.
So far as the first shortage of $1000 Is
concerned, there is no possibility that it
is due to a mistake in bookkeeping, for
not only have the Recorder's books been
compared with the Auditor's, but the re
ceipts for all the sums deposited have
been compared with the books of the
Recorder, and no mistake on the part of
the Auditor was made. The shortage is
hardly explicable on the theory of an
error in bookkeeping, for the amount
withheld is nearly a third of the whole
amount that should have been turned in
Just what has become of the money is
not known. A theory exists here that
it has been used by Mr. Kerr in the oil
business. He is heavily involved in sev
eral companies in Kern County, and per
haps used the money in paying assess
ments. Mr. Kerr is an old resident here
and is a very popular man. The news of
the shortage will come as a great blow to
a large number of people throughout the
county who have known and respected
Kerr for many years. He was elected to
the position of Recorder on the Demo
cratic ticket in 1898.
Vacaville Votes Against Bonds.
VACAVILL.E, Nov. 20.â An election was
held to-day to authorize the issuing of
$30,000 bonds for a sewer system. Tho
resuit was: For bonds, 122; against, 68
The proposition failed, since it lacked

Twenty Jews Reported Killed.

saw Bay that twenty Jews have been
killed in anti-Semitic disturbances at
Olvipolo,
dies, who was caring for the injured, did
not believe it possible for him to survive
long. His wife and two children boarded
the train at The Needles and are with
the dying man.
"The shock was so slight that I hardly
felt it in the fourth car," said E. H. Rod
man, a manufacturer's agent from Chi
cago. "I knew that the stop was sudden,
but could not realize that such a wreck
could have occurred and anybody come
out of it alive. The lighter character of
the vestibuled car in front, a combination
coaeti, explains the death of so many of
the trainmen who were in it. It was
crushed by the weight of the heavy
coaches behind and then flames added to
the horror of the disaster. None of the
sleepers were damaged. The passengers
rapidly crawled out and all endeavors
were bent toward saving those who were
so badly injured in the front cars, one on
each train.
"Two of the engines were oil burners
and the engines and seven coaches were
soon enveloped in burning oil. I believe
the bodies of at least three of the train
men who were killed were burned. One
of the sad details is the fact that the
body of a little child was in a casket on
board the east-bound train, being taken
East for burial. The casket and contents
are in ashes and the parents, who were
in charge of it, are on this train going
back to Los Angeles.
"It was about three hours from the
time of the accident until help arrived.
Trains came from both directions at about 1
the same time, and as soon as possible
the company was doing all it could
for us. The passengers and those of the
train crew who could help pulled away
four cars, one at a time, from the burn
ing mass and saved them. One of the
coaches which was loosened-from the east
bound train grot away and ran back down
the hill eight miles. The brakes would
not work and the car could not be
stopped until it hit a level piece of track.
"Some of the passengers said they diÂ«l
not feel the shock of the collision at all.
ar.d the only one that got much of a
scratch was one who was in a drawing
room. Not being able to get out at the
door, he broke through a glass with his
revolver and crawled out and was cut by
the broken glass. The dining car conduc
tor on the west-bound train, who escaped
unhurt, but with very scanty clothing,
said that the men in the combination
cach had no chance for their lives at all.
"Two of my waiters are dead, my chef
badly hurt and all I saved is what you
see I have on. My clothes, my monej
and most of my help are gone."
The three Pullmans which made up the
train that arrived heTe to-night were not
damaged and the hurried glance permit
ted by the train's five-minute stop in thi-Â»
city did not Indicate that even so much
as the glass was broken. The heavy
frame of the cars saved them, but helped
to crush what was ahead.
A railroad man in authority here said
to-night that the loss to the company
would be not less than $250,000 in equip
ment alone, leaving out of account the
loss to business, possible damage suits and
everything else but the rolling stock
ruined, which included seven ctfaches and
three engines.

SAYS MURDERER
WAS AT INQUEST
Sheriff May Soon Land
Slayer of Wilcox
Family.
Unable Yet to Supply Motive
for Triple Crime Near
Downey.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20.-The pa^t
twenty-four hours has disclosed no tangi
ble clew to the perpetrator of the triple
murder at Downey, oi which A. P. Wil
cox, his wife and infant son were the vic
tims. If Sheriff Haimnel has discovered
a clewâ and he intimates that he hasâ he
has studiously kept it to himself. Bud
Lewis, the divorced ht-bband of the mur
dered woman, upon whom the authorities
believed suspicion at first rested, hs.3
cleared himself to such an extent th-H
the Sheriff considers it useless to arrest
him. Sheriff Hammel Jo-day positively
reiterated his opinion tnat the murderer
of the Wilcox family was some person
other than Lewis.
"I have my suspicion?," said the Sheriff.
"The person who in n^y opinion commit
ted the murders was present at the in
quest yesterday in Dov.-ney. Future devel
opments will determine whether 1 am r.gni
or wrong. I oelieve the crime \vaÂ» c u m
mitted last Saturday night, but, or cuurt,.',
the exact time may nc'.tr be uetermintd.
We are making every effort to apprehend
the guilty person, and v."iil run djwa every
clew until the murderir is arrested. '
The evidence adduced at the niquedi
shed no light whatever upon the mys
tery, not even fixing toe approximate date
of the crime with any degree ot certain
ty. The Jury; however, brought in a ver
dict fixing the time of death at "prooably
on Sunday evening, November 17, fioas
gunshot wounds, inflicted by a party or
parties unknown to thy jury."
At the Morgue to-day Coroner Holland
made a more careful examination of cne
wounds and found that were many moio
than the preliminary report disclosed. A.I
the bodies show wounds on the head from
some blunt, triangular instrument. Two
bullet wounds were found on the body oi
the child, one through the head and a.i
other through the neck, the latter having
been fired at such clc-e range as to pow
der-burn the skin.
Only one bullet wound was found in the
man's body. In this case the bullet en
tered the thigh, apparently from behind,
and came out at the groin. Wilcox was
plainly beaten- to death with the same
blunt instrument that left bruises upjn
the heads of tne other two victims. Cor
oner Holland said to-day:
"Aside from the fact that it was the act
of a bloodthirsty fiend, there are somo
features which would seem to Indicate
that the unfortunate persons were first
beaten into insensibility, and that tho
shooting followed in a spirit of wanton
deviltry. The murder of the child is or"
feature of the crime that might indicate
that it was the work of a maniac. X
robbery had been tho motive it is un
likely that the child would have been
killed. I think the crime was committed
by one man. though I would not be cer
tain of this."

OLYMPIC ATHLETIC CLUB FOOTBALL TEAM DEFEATS NEVADA
IN A HARD-FOUGHT GAME ON SAGEBRUSH STATE GRIDIRON
EXPERTS TO PLAY "SPORT VASCO"
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICA
Elaborate and Costly Preparations for Introducing the Game at Cen
tral Park by Aid of the Most Skillful Players.
MORE excitlrg than bullfighting.
This is one of the expressions
used by the promoters of "Spcrt
Vasco." which has made a hit
in South America and Mexico
and is to be Introduced here next week.
A splendid court of brick, cement anl
â¢tone, costing $35,000, nas been erected In
Central Park. Eighteen of the most skil
ful exponents of the game have been
brought here from the City of Mexico to
introduce it in America, this city being
the first place it ie to be tried in in this
country.
The game is handbali developed to enor
inous proportions. The players use a pt
culiarly shaped wicker scoop of great
strength, which is attached to the right
hand, something after the manner of i
boxing glove, as shown in the Illustration.
The leverage secure-l through this at
tachment ghoots the ball through the air
so fast the eyo cannot mark its flight.
The game originated ln the Pyrenees. It
was played afterward ln Brazil and Ar-

EXPERT "SPORT VASC6" PLAYERS, MEMBERS OP THE TEAM NOW
IN THIS CITY TO INTRODUCE THE GAME IN AMERICA. THE
PHOTOQRAPH SHOWS THE INSTRUMENT USED BY PLAYERS,
BAD COLLISION
ON POST STREET
Slippery Rails and Poor
Brakes Result in
Damage.
A car of the O'Farrell-street branch
of the California-street Railroad ran Into
a car of the Post-street line at the cor
ner of Post ar.i Jones streets about 8
o'clock last night and as a result at least
a dozen people were slightly injured.
That the accident did not result more
seriously is little short of a miracle.
Both cars were going toward town, and
the O'Farrell-street car was crowded
with passengers, many of whom were on
the way to the opera.
The gripman or the cable car applied
his brakes above the corner to let the
Post-street car, which has the right of
way at that point, pass, but they would
not hold on the slippery rails. In a sec
ond the cars came together, the cable
car striking with such force that the
electric was derailed and forced fifteen
feet off the track.
Broken glass flew ln all directions, and
several lady passengers on the O'FarreTl
street car were slightly cut. The Injured
were taken to Martin's drug store at tue
corner, where Dre. W. E. Stevens and 1.
W. Thome, who were in the collision,
treated them.
F. A. Hjelte, a tailors' cutter, was bad
ly cut about the hand, and John Mc-
Donald suffered similar Injuries. The
other victims refused to disclose their
identity and soon departed.
The Post-street car was almost com
pletely wrecked, but the cable car beyond
the broken glass was but slightly dam
aged.

gentlne republic, the man who introduce 1 !
it being credited with naving made $1,500,
00. From there it was transplanted to
Mexico, where it has thrived, although
but a small portion of the population are
patrons of spjrt. The principal court in
the City of Mexico is a splendid stone
structure, which cost $200,000 in silver
The returns from the game in eight
months were said to be $300,000.
The athletic looking players who have
been brought here to Introduce the game
have been trained at it from boyhood,
and are the pick of Lhe men engaged in
it. Three years ago a third-rate "vasco"
player visited this city, and using a wood
en paddle defeated Jack Bonnet, Jim
Nealon and other noted handball experts.
The court at Central Park is 208 feet
long, 35 feet wide, with a wall 45 feet high
Inclosing It on three sides, leaving the
fourth side, nearest the spectators, open.
The front wall, (agalnbt which play Is di
rected, is four feet thick. It is faced with
Colusa freestone. Experiments have been
made with a brick wall, but one of the3e
lasted only six days owing to the fierce
ness of the play. The game Is so fast
that players can stand but one match a
day. The game Is one of science. The
players, by a dexterous turn of the wrist,
can perform wondrous feats with the
ball. The game is saia to be replete with
surprises, every hit being a new play.

HERO OF THE DAY
Scores the Only Points
of the Game by a
Field Goal.
With Only Fifteen , Seconds
to Play He ; Makes a
' Great Place Kick. \
Â¦
RENO, Nov. 20.â One of the best foot
ball games of the season was played here
this afternoon on the University of Ne
vada gridiron between the Olympic Club
eleven of San Francisco and the Univer
sity of Nevada. The game was hard
fought, the players being evenly matched,
although the Olympics outweighed Ne
vada by nearljt twenty pounds to the
man.
The visitors won the toss and kicked to
the thirty-flve-yard line. Nevada carried
the ball back twenty yards for first down.
Nevada, on a fake play by Graham,
gained thirty-five yards. Through re
peated bucks they carried the ball to
Olympic's forty-yard line, where they
were held and forced to punt over the line.
The Olympics returned the ball by a punt
to Nevada* territory. Nevada again Se
cured the ball on downs and carried it
again to the Olympic's thirty-five-yard
line, where they were again held in check
by the strong Olympic line. The half
ended with the ball in Nevada's territory.
In the second half Nevada kicked to the
forty-yard line and the Olympics returned
the ball to the twenty-yard line. The
Olympics then ran Gammon through the
center for a thirty-yard gain. Buck after
buck brought the ball to Nevada's ten
yard line. Here Nevada held them, and
secured the ball on downs, with one minute
and twenty second of time remaining.
Nevada punted twenty-five yards and
downed the Olympic man as he caught the
pigskin, with only fifteen seconds of time
remaining.
The Olympics became desperate and
tried Jack Rlthet for a thlrty-flve-yard
place kick. His aim was sure and the ball
flew between the goal posts amid cheers
from the Olympic enthusiasts. The game
ended with the ball on Olympic's twenty
yard line. The final score was Olympic 5,
Nevada 0. Keddie, Leadbetter, Drips and
B. Smith did not participate in the game.
CADETS WIN HANDIIiY.
Administer a Crushing Defeat to
University of Pennsylvania
Eleven.
WEST POINT, N. V., Nov. 20.â The
University of Pennsylvania football team
was defeated by the West Point Military
Academy to-day and incidentally suffered
one of the worst defeats in her football
history. The scoreâ 24 to oâ shows how
West Point outplayed the Pennsylvanlans.
The visitors put up a stiff game, however,
and were beaten simply because of West
Point's superiority.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Nov. 20.â Columbia
beat the naval cadets to-day, but by a
narrow margin. The game, which was
closely fought from beginning to end, re
sulted in a score of 6 to 5 for tho New
Yorkers, but was in doubt until the last
minute. When the game was called Belk
nap kicked off for the navy. Morley got
the ball and started up the Held, but when
tackled by one of the sailors fumbled the
ball and a cadet fell on It. Then the
middies began to hammer the Columbia's
line, which yielded slowly to the weight
the cadets threw upon it. Nichols, Freyer
and Land rushed the ball forward and
Land scored the first touchdown after five
minutes of play. Freyer failed at goal.
In the second half Columbia started in
fiercely to redeem herself. The navy tried
their rush tactics again, but Columbia's
defense seemed stronger and the sailors
were forced to do considerable kicking.
Columbia, on th^ other hand, began
smashing the navy's line right and left,
using several trick plays to advantage at
the same time.
One of their plays resulted in Shaw
g'ettlng the ball, which he passed back to,
Weeks and, through good interference by
Morley, Weeks made a run around the
navy's right end for twenty yards. He
also made another run in this half of
twenty-five yards.
With the ball on the navy's forty-yard
line Columbia used a close formation play
and Captain Berren broke through the
navy's line and ran the distance for a
touchdown. Bruce kicked goal. When
but six' minutes of play yet remained the
navy had the ball on Columbia's forty
five-yard line and tried hard, but ln vain,
to make another score.

Autolight Captures the Temescal Handicap !n Easy Fashion From
Rio Shannonâ -Forkford First at Long Odds.
ps-npe^HERE â¢ were changes enough in
I > the conditions of the track at
I ~ : Oakland yesterday to suit almost
J, ' Â¦ any of the equine epicures. Foi
; i Â¦",Â¦ three events it was good, but a
couple .of seconds slow. Then rain began
falling and the footing changed to moist,
then Juicy, and finally sloppy. Four . fa
vorites struggled - through these various
deviations, and Forkford and Duckoy,
two well played outsiders, added their
mite to the discomfiture of the ring.
Standing out as the feature of the card,
the Temescal handicap, at. one mile and
a sixteenth, furnished another opportun
ity for Autolight to fold himself- up in
another set of brackets. Only four an
swered post call, with the Morris horse
a 7, to 10 favorite. Bullman, on. Rio Shan
non, tried to steal away in the rain, but
O'Connor, peering through his goggles,
kept the iavorite closer up than usual
and when ready won as he liked. Gray
teid ran a good third. > . ,
Nearly everybody busied themselves
getting a bet down on Torslna to take
the nrst race, forcing the price to even
money. The old mare didn't take kindly
to the footing or else something didn't
suit her, for both she and Johnny Woods
landed in the show. Ransom, on Fork
ford, a 12 and 15 to 1 shot, fairly well
played, made all the running and was not
all out at the wire to beat Hungarian a
length.' â¢ i
Tne footing was not muddy enough for
Muresca, the fast filly from "Frisco"
Llnd's stable. Still she stood a long, hard
drive, which coupled with Birkenruth's
good handling got her across the mark
a head in advance of Hainault for the
two-year-old number. The winner ruled
a warm favorite and was fortunate in
not being bothered. Hoar on Hainault
was slow to leave the barrier, and had
to make considerable early use of his
mount to get up to the favorite. Fur
ther down the line Bullman closed strong
with Colonial Girl, making a three head
finish at the wire. ' . . . . '. ,
Galanthus, from Jimmy Coffey's stable,
made a runaway race of the mile and
a'Â¦ furlong selling affair. The gelding
closed favorite over Lizella, and the re
sult was never in doubt. The last named
mare seemed unable to exert herself, fin
ishing last, behind Sunello and Free
Lance. x ; - '
The two-year-old Sombrero, a 7 to 10
chance, ran circles around an all-aged
field in the fifth number. Byron Rose at
15 to 1 beat Maresa for " the place.
Bullman rode his first winner :at the
meeting in the { final seven-furlong I run.
He had: the leg up on Duckoy, which
horse was backed down from 5 to 3. In
the lead soon after the start, he was
never headed. Redwald took the place
from Merops, with , Pat Morrissey, the
post choice, back in the ruck.
Track Notes.
Jockey Buchanan was due from the I
East last night. I
John Bullman received a letter yester
day from McCue, in which the irrepres

HOPES TO BEAT
WORLD'S RECORD
A Well-Known Boston
Clubman on a Tour
of the Globe.
The example set by Jules Verne's fa
mous hero in "A Tour of the World In
Eighty Days" has had its followers in
numerous instances since the appearance
of that renowned novel, but the latest as
pirant for honors in that direction is L.
R. Prince, a well-known clubman and
millionaire of Boston, who arrived here
last night on his trip around the world.
Prince has made a wager of $10,000 that
he will beat the world's record in the
globe trotting: line, and ho has many
friends who assert their belief that ne
will win the wager.
Prince is a gentleman of leisure and
time often hangs heavy on his lianas.
One night at the club the achievements
of globe trotters were under discussion
ana naturally Verne'-s idea of circling
the globe in eighty days was not neglect
ed. Prince said that the trip of a woman
connected with a New York magazine
which required sixty-nine days to make
the *our could easily be beaten by a de
termined man. One of Prince's friends
said it could not be done within a shorter
period and Prince remarked that he had
$10,000 which said it could be. The chal
lenge was immediately accepted, and
Prince had time scarcely to change his
clothes in order to make the tram for
New York. He reached Gotham In fine
trim and on the following morning was on
his way to San Francisco.
Prince telegraphed ahead for a berth
on the China steamer which sails to-mor
row and he will be aboard when the whis
tle Is blown. On his arrival last night
he was met by several acquaintances
and, with them, he spent the evening at
the Pacific-Union Club. ' Prince was not
at his hotel at a late hour and could not
be seen.
It is Prince's Intention to make the tour

THE SWIFT SPECIFIC CO.. ATLANTA. %A.COLOMBIAN LIBERALS MAKE RUSH AND CAPTURE
COLON AFTER THREE HOURS OF HARD FIGHTING
Twelve Men Are Killed and Thirty Wounded
During the Assault on the Practically
Undefended Town.
Considerable Uneasiness Also Felt Concerning
the Fate of Panama and a Big Battle
Is in Progress*
OLOX. Colombia, Nov. 20. via. Gal
(T \ eston. â The Liberals made an un
(l . expected attack on Colon at 8
WÂ«xpecied attack on Colon at 8
o'clock last night. The Govern
ment was not prepared and there
no resistance. After some fighting
; .i front of the Cuartel and ln certain
streets for an hour and a half the Liberals
ira.ir.fd possession of all the public offices
Â«mci the town of Colon. The Prefect,
Guardia, is a prisoner.
Over twelve men were killed and about
thirty men were wounded.
The United States gunboat Macbias,
now here, took no part in the proceedings
except to land marines.
On receipt of the news that General
Alban, the military commander of the
isihmus, had started to attack the Lib
erals at Chorrera, near Panama, the lat
ter detached 160 men under General Patlno
to attack Colon. This force embarked on
board a train bound from Panama to .
Colon yesterday evening 1 at Las Cascades
station, previously cutting off telegraphic \
communication across the isthmus. On |
arriving at the outskirts of Colon, where
the Government usually maintained a '
*mall guard, the rebels left the train and
in the initial skirmish, which began soon
afterward, Patino was killed.
Colonel Barrera Commands.
The command of the Liberals then de- '
volved on Colonel Frederico Ban-era and
they continued their march on Colon, ar- ;
living there a few minutes after the train, |
thus surprising the v.hole town.
The Government troops at Colon were I
outnumbered by the Liberals. Fighting !
immediately began at the Cuartel (bar- j
racks), which was soon taken. There j
Senor Jaen, a Judge of the Criminal i
Court, was killed and Senor Muskus, the !
district representative of the Department ;
Iv! the Interior, was mortally wounded.
" Fighting subsequently occurred at the '
town hall, "which was also taken by the i
Liberals. Among the prisoners captured j
by the Liberals there were the Prefect, j
Guardia. and the commandant of police.
Senor Parenas. the Mayor, managed to j
reach the gunboat General Pirzon. which I
sailed last night for a destination un- ]
knows.
The whole affair was over in less than
three hours.
Big Battle Is Now On.
Communication with Panama was re
stored to-day. This revealed that no
f.g-hting had occurred there, that every
thing was quiet and that the city was
still in the hands of the Government.
The issue now depends on the result of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1901.
here from Panama nothing has yet been
heard in that city concerning the outcome
of General Alban's expedition against the
Liberal forces at Chorrera. It Is said that
information of the recent happenings at
Colon has been sent to him.
In the meantime the Government troors
at Panama, numbering about 300 men, are
busily engaged in the construction of
earthworks and barricades at the railroaa
bridge going into the city in anticipation
of an early Liberal attack.
Colonel Shaler says that no request has
been made upon him for a special train
to convey Government troops to Colon to
night. If such a request Is made it will
be granted, but Colonel Shaler does net
consider it likely. The Liberals say they
have at least 100 men in possession of the
different railroad stations on the line be
tween here and Panama. These men will
doubtless do their utmost to prevent the
transportation of Government troops to
this point.
All Depends on Alban.
NEW YORK. Nov. 20.â Arturo de Bri
gard, Consul General of Colombia, to-day
received private dispatches informing him
that the Liberals had surprised and cap
tured the city of Colon last night. His
telegram places the loss at twelve killed
and thirty wounded. Brigard said that
the taking of the town does not amount
to much, as It is not a fortified place, and
that General Carlos Alban, who Is Gov
ernor of the department of Panama, is
now in the city of Panama with 1100
trained troops. He said that when Gen
eral Alban returned to Colon the Liberals
would run away. Tbe Consul General
said General Alban expected to give bai.
tle to-day to the Liberals on the Pacific
side of Panama, at Chorrera. After that
battle, the Consul said, the general would
go to .Colon. General Alban has ample
ammunition for all purposes.
Brlernrd said that when General Alban
left Colon he took all the available troops,
leaving the town in charge of fifty police
men. At the office pf the Panama Rail
way and Steamship Company it was said
that the officers had received advices that
the town had been surprised by the Lib
erals. The advices did not say how many
Liberals were in the attacking party, but
it was supposed the force was not larger
than 300.
Dr. Restrepo, head of the Colombian
revolutionary junta Ir>. this city, to-night
gave out a statement, in which he said:
Liberals Set a Trap.
As reported. General Alban, with 1100 men
and several field nieces, has started to attack

Eastern Railroad Official Declares
That the Company Will Not
Make Concessions.
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â The 300 striking
switchmen of the New York, New Ha
ven and Hartford Railroad met to-day to
discuss plans for aiding their cause. At
the conclusion of the meeting of the strik
ers Vice Grand Master Ames of the
Switchmen's Union stated that it had
been decided to send notices to every em

and Boston, requesting their sympathetic
strike in case the demands of the strik
ers, are not complied with.
Division Superintendent Sheperd said
that under no circumstances would any
of the men on strike ever be employed
by the company again. He said he antici
pated no trouble in filling the strikers'
places.

our forces, now entrenched at Chorrera, fifteen
miles from Panama. We have 3000 men there
and according to numbers we might be expectea
to defeat General Alban. Yet he is confident
he can rout us. His confidence is based on the
belief that our force, under General Benjamin
Herrera. with General Lugo in Immediate com
mand. Is poorly equipped.
Therein lies the trap. We have therein 3000
stand of arms, which have been sent from
New York within the last three months. We
have artillery also. General Alban will find
that he has made the mistake of his life in
attacking us, for that is what we have tried
for three months to tempt him into doing.
We firmly believe that within two days Pan
ama and the rest of the isthmus will bÂ« in
our hands. We spread reports that we lacked
rifles and that we had no ammunition, and
General Alban believed them.
News has been received by Dr. Restre
po that the Colombian revolutionists
have purchased a gunboat of 700 tons dis
placement that has been built for the re
public of Salvador. Besides this vessel
the insurgents have two other gunboats.
Dr. Restrepo says the boat recently pur
chased is armed with eight breech-load
ing guns of two miles' range and with
four gatlings.
TROOPS ON THE WAY
TO ATTACK INSURGENTS
Operations Near Panama Give Prom
ise of a Battle Between Small
Forces.
COLON, Colombia, Nov. 19 (via Galves
ton).âGeneral Alban, with a force of 1100
men, well armed and supplied with am
munition and having cannon and modern
quick-firing guns with them, has started
to attack the insurgent forces which are
strongly intrenched at Chorrera, Half of
General Alban's force left Panama in
large launches, towed by the Colombian
gunboat Boyaca. The remainder marched
overland. These forces are to combine
and make a front and rear attack on the
insurgents. Chorrera is only one day's
march from Panama. General Castro ac
companies General Alban.
General Lugo is in command of the in
surgent forces, though Domingo Diaz is
the nominal head. The Liberals claim
that they possess a stronger force than
the Government, but it is generally ad
mitted that they are indifferently armed
and poorly supplied with ammunition.
News of a decisive Government victory
fls confidently expected this week. Gen
eral Alban's marching orders were kept
secret until the moment the troops wero.
ordered to move. A majority of the
troops which arrived here Sunday last on
board the gunboat General Pinzon will
remain at Panama in order to garrison
that city.

Have Been Poisoned by Miss

CATAUMET, Mass., Nov. 20.â 1n con
nection with the State's investigation of
the suspicion of murder against Miss Jane
Toppan, who is in jail at Barnstable,
pending a hearing, the bodies of Mr. and
Mrs. Allan P. Davis were disinterred to
day and an autopsy held to ascertain if
possible the exact cause of death. Mr.
and Mrs. Davis died within a short time
of each other last July and within a few
weeks of the death of Mrs. Harry Gordon
of Chenoa and Mrs. Mary Gibbs, their
daughters. Miss Toppan is accused of
having killed Mrs. Gibbs. The State offi
cers suspect that the four deaths were
due to poison administered by Miss Top
pan, who was the nurse ln each case.

{* N. W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.
(I â American bluejackets have
been landed at Colon to preserve
American treaty rights across the |
isthmus of Panama. Commander Me- j
Crea, commanding the gunboat Machiaa,
row at Colon, cabled the Navy Depart
ment under date of to-day that "insur
gents have possession of the city. At the
request of the. proper authorities I have
landed forces for the protection of the
property of the railroad."
Consul Malmros at Colon reported that j
the town had been occupied by insurgents
last night. Consul General Gudger re- j
ported that a band of insurgents had
taken passage on the railroad for Colon
and wl;en near their destination had cut j
the telegraph wires and torn up a rail
so as to prevent the Government from
sending reinforcements. A subsequent dis
patch announced the success of the move
ment. Consul Malmros added to the in
telligence concerning the fall of Colon
the reassuring . information that while
business is suspended transit is not in- !
terrupted and American lite ana propeny
are safe and are not likeiy to be ln dan
ger.
Serious Situation in Panama.
Administration officials are convinced
that the situation in Panama is most seri
ous. Dispatches from, several oiflciais
caused conferences between Secretary
L,ong and Acting becretaiy of State Hill
and finally a conference at the White
House, participated in by the Presiaeni, ,
Acting becreiary Hill and Hear Admiral j
Crownlnshield, Chief of the Bureau o( I
Navigation. At these conferences fuil dis- (
cussion was given to the American treaty ;
rights in the isthmus of Panama, and tne i
President read over this articie of the |
treaty of the New Granada, which sets i
forth the obligations of the United States: I
"In order to secure to themselves tran- !
quil and constant enjoyment of these ad- I
vantages and as an especial compensation Â¦
for said advantages and for tavors as i
they have acquired, the United States j
guarantees, positively and efficaciously,
to New Granada, by present stipulation, j
perfect neutrality of the isthmus, with
a view that free transit from one to the i
other sea may not be interrupted or em- j
barrassed in any future time while this j
treaty exists and in consequence the
United States also guarantees, in the !
same manner, the rights of sovereignty I
and property which New Granada has and |
possesses over said territory."
Will Uphold the Treaty.
Tho President decided that the ob
ligations stated in the foregoing must be
observed and in accordance with his de
cision instructions were cabled to Consul
General Gudger at Panama, directing him
to issue a proclamation prohibiting inter
ference with traffic across the isthmus |
and announcing that such interference
will be followed by intervention by the
Unitsd States.
He was further directed to consult with
Captain Thomas Perry, commanding the
battleship lowa. Captain Perry was or
dered to land men if necessary to observe
the treaty stipulation with New Granada
and to consult with Consul General Gud
ger for the protection of American inter
ests. The lowa has a personnel of 470
enlisted men and could easily land 300
men. The Concord left Acapulco some
days ago and will shortly arrive at Pan
ama. The Machias has a crew of 143
men. She will soon be reinforced by the
Marietta, which left Key West yesterday.
The battleship Indiana is now in the Car
ibbean Sea and can be ordered to Colon
If her presence is required.
The entire North Atlantic squadron will
sail on December 1 for the West Indies.
It is conceded by officials to be possible
that conditions will arise similar to those
which prevailed in 1885 and which required
the intervention of this Government.

A DANGEROUS OFFENSE.
HAD San Francisco needed an object lesson to
teach the importance of the ordinance forbid
ding the obstruction of entrances and passage
ways of places of public assemblage, it would have
been abundantly furnished by the scenes witnessed at
the Grand Opera-house on Tuesday^ evening. The
desire to attend the performance of the evening was
great and the managers of the opera company in
their eagerness to profit by it sold so many admission
tickets that the purchasers thronged the lobbies and
the aisles, and even then not all of the ticket holders
could procure admission to the building. It was in
fact so packed, jammed and crowded that many per
sons holding reserved seats v.ere unable to get to
them.
An eye witness of the scene after describing the
struggle c f the crowds to make their way to the ticket
office, and the crow the lobby and at the en
trance to the gallery before the doors were opened â
a scramble so intense that the police were unable to
keep order â says that at last the word was given to
allow the holders of general admission tickets to
enter the theater; and then adds: "In a few minutes
every inch of the aisles was blocked and when the
holders of tickets for boxes, the orchestra and dres's
circle sought to take their seats it required the
courage of a football player to try and get through
the mass of humanity. Ladies garbed in gorgeous
array were forced to struggle after their escorts, who
nought to make a passape way through the densely
packed aisles. Valuable dresses were torn and. in
some cases, jewels were wrenched away. When the
overture began the seats were not half filled, owing
to the inability of ticket holders to gain their places."
An incident of that kind ought not to be permitted
to pass t-.r.noted by the municipal authorities. No
ore wishes to be unjust to the managers t( the opera
company. In fact most music lovers are so grateful
to the company for bringing so brilliant an array of
singers to the city and presenting so successfully the
masterpieces of music, they are willing to condone
almost anything the management may do. It is the
general desire that the season prove profitable to the
company, and no one wishes to put a single unneces
sary restriction upon its operations. There are limits,
however, beyond which even the most tolerant good
nature cannot permit the manager of a theater to go;
and those limits were exceeded by the opera man
agers on Tuesday evening.
The city ordinance on the subject declares: "It
shall be unlawful for any person, firm company or
corporation to obstruct or cause or allow to be
obstructed in any way the entrances, exits, aisles,
stairways, lobbies, or passageways of any theater, hall,
concert hall or place of public assemblage during any
performance, service, exhibition, lecture, concert, or
during any public assemblage of any kind." It is
made the duty of the Chief of Police to carry out the
provisions of the order, and the penalty imposed for
the offense is a fine not exceeding $500, or imprison
ment for six months, or both. The ordinance, there
fore, is adequate to deal with the offense and it should
be enforced.
The crush of Tuesday evening fortunately passed
without any loss of life, but had there been a panic,
which is so easy to start in a crowd already excited
by the struggling of one with another in an inclosed
space, the results would have been frightful. San
Francisco cannot aJTord to take risks of that kind.
The city authorities should see to it that an example
is made of the offenders in this case, which will be an
ample warning to others who may be tempted to
follow a similar course in future.
Now comes a Boston physician and says that if you
smile early and smile often you can cure any case of
the "blues" that attacks you, but he doesn't define
what he means by "emUe."
We have hardly got the municipal election finished
up, yet already the bosses are laying wires for the
State election. Truly this is a world in which the
wicked never rest
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1901.
AMERICAN DIPLOMACY.
SECRETARY HAY'S address on "American-
Diplomacy" at the Chamber of Commerce
banquet in New York on Tuesday evening will
doubtless rank among tHe most notable speeches ever
delivered on such an occasion. Even the brief sum
mary telegraphed *to the press suffices to, show that
it is one of the best of Mr. Hay's addresses; and that
is saying much, for there are few orators of our time
whose ideas of statecraft are higher than his, or whose
oratory is . marked by. such excellence of literary
finish. '"Â¦ Â¦; :-.
The speech can be read by all Americans with keen
satisfaction, for with hardly a reference or a sug
gestion of his own share in the work, the Secretary of
State has set forth in a striking manner first the es
sential difference between American diplomacy and
that which has prevailed in the Old World; and
second the benefits which our methods of diplomacy
hive conferred not upon ourselves only but upon all
American states, and indirectly upon the world at
large.
Reviewing the history of diplomacy generally, the
Secretary said: "There was a time when diplomacy
was a science of intrigue and falsehood, of traps and
mines ma countermines." Into that kind of diplo
macy v American statesmen never entered. . Our
methods of dealing with foreign nations were from
the first straightforward and honest. Mr. Hay says:.
"In my experience of diplomatic life, which now
covers more years than I like to look back upon, as*
in the far greater record of American diplomacy
which I have read and studied, I can say without hesi
tation that we have generally told squarely what we
wanted, announced early in negotiations what we
were willing tc give, and allowed the other side to
accept or reject' our terms."
For many a year our straightforward, frank dealing
with any nation with which we might have contro
versy was a serious disturbance to European conven
tionalities. Â¦ Their statesmen used to refer to it as
"shirt /sleeve diplomacy." It was looked upon as
something crude or worse. However, the shrewder
leaders of the Old World perceived that the American
method had its advantages. It facilitated interna
tional business and it inspired a feeling of respect for
the Government whose representatives had the frank
ness to speak the truth and the courage to stand
firmly for what is right. In the end they began to
follow the American method, and now the old system
of intrigue is nearly obsolete. Speaking of his own
experience Mr. Hay was able to say: "During the
time in which I have been prominently concerned in
our foreign relations I can say we have been met
by the representatives of other powers in the same
spirit of frankness and sincerity."
It is a great thing for a nation to have accomplished
that much in the field of diplomacy, and the satisfac
tion is greater because the nation has never lost by it.
Nearly every important contention of this country in
international politics has been won by us. We have
demonstrated that in diplomacy as in other fields of
human endeavor, "corruption wins not more than
honesty." We are now entering upon a career as a
world power which will soon establish us as the fore
most nation on the globe; and yet there is no people,
however weak, that need fear any aggression on our
part. We stand for international justice and for frank
honesty in all negotiations to maintain it.
The Secretary of State, doubtless for good reasons,
made a special reference to the attitude of American
diplomacy toward the states of Latin America. In
those states fears have been expressed that we aim at
establishing a domination over them. Those fears
have been adroitly increased by Europeans who seek
to incite antagonism to our expanding influence and
commerce. Of the South American and Central
American people the Secretary said: "We no more
want their territory than we covet the mountains of
the moon. Not even our earnest desire for peace
among them will lead us to any action which might
offend their national dignity or their just sense of
independence. We would endow them with all the
consideration we claim for ourselves."
Such is American diplomacy as expressed by a
Secretary of State of whom it may be said he has not
only described it, but illustrates it.
The bosses seem to have concluded that the pri
mary law must be knocked out. but that would be
taking a mean revenge, for in the last election it was
not the primary law that hit them hardest. It was
the people.
RECIPROCITY TREATIES.
KAISER WILHELM was reported a short time
ago to have said: "If no commercial treaties
are negotiated, I will smash things to pieces."
When the report was submitted to Senator Cullom,
who is slated for the chairmanship of the Senate com
mittee on foreign relations, he said: "If there be any
truth in the dispatch from Berlin respecting the re
markable declaration of the Emperor, it admits of
but one meaning and that is that in the absence of
satisfactory reciprocal treaties Germany will abandon
her present system of moderate tariff and substitute
for it something approaching to non-intercourse com
mercially with nations that refuse Germany fair treat
ment. I infer that the Emperor of Germany means
that unless we revise our tariff laws or adopt recip
rocal measures which will give Germany better op
portunities to get into our markets, he will resort to
retaliatory methods to keep our products out of Ger
many. Threats of retaliation will not have any influ
ence upon the Government of the United States in
its endeavors to protect its own interests both at home
and abroad."
There may be no truth in the report concerning the
statement of the German Emperor, but the fact it
was reported in Berlin and believed there is proof
that it represents a phase of public sentiment in Ger
many. If the Emperor did not use the threat attrib
uted to him, it is certain that a good many Germans
would be pleased to have him make such a threat
and live up to it. In fact, commercial competition
has now become so keen that a considerable number
of persons in Europe are losing their mental balance
on the subject and would probably be glad to see the
beginning of a war of tariff retaliations among the
different countries in the hope that they might profit
by it.
Evidences of the spirit expressed in the threat at
tributed to the Kaiser are to be found in the utter
ances of many of the leaders and the organs of the
German Agrarians, of French economists and notably
in the addresses made at the recent conference of
the Austrian agricultural and manufacturing interests
at Vienna. Over and over again we have been told
that the United States must make tariff concessions
or face a commercial war.
The temper thus displayed by the nations of Europe
is in itself a sufficient warning to the United States
of the difficulties that will attend the undertaking
of an elaborate system of reciprocity treaties. As Mr.
Carnegie has said, reciprocity is a nice word to say,
but the thing itself would be difficult to devise and
more difficult to maintain. The jealousies of Euro
pean nations would lead each of them to strive to get
the better not only of us but of one another in the
arrangement of such treaties; and as a consequence
there would be incessant bickerings. In the end, as
Senator Hoar has pointed out, we would have to
take our tariff regulations out of the hands of Con
gress and leave them to the State Department to be
determined by treaties with foreign powers. There
would be confusion both at home and abroad and a
continual temptation to some power to get in and
smash things.
The system of reciprocity proposed by Mr. Blame
and embodied in Republican platforms was expressed
at Philadelphia in the declaration: "We favor the as
sociated policy of reciprocity so directed as to open
our markets on favorable terms for what we do not
ourselves produce in return for free foreign markets."
By standing firmly by that system of reciprocity, we
would neither sacrifice our industries at home nor
embroil ourselves abroad. Any departure from it
would result in perplexity and wrong to some Ameri
can interest. The United States has much less to fear
from any retaliation that may be devised by a Euro
pean nation, or by all Europe combined, than it would
have from the weakening of the protective system by
varying reciprocity treaties. It is decidedly best to
keep our tariff regulations in our own hands. We do
not need commercial alliances any more than military
alliances. Our policy should be that of friendliness to
all, but special favors to none.
It is announced that King Leopold of Belgium
will visit this country. Although he is 66 years old
he has been a high roller and it is said he still likes a
high time, so we may as well prepare to give him a
royal reception in the American meaning of the word.
THE CASE OF MISS STONE.
DISPATCHES from Europe announce the ex
istence of a belief in Sofia that the diplomatic
agent in that city of the United States has
notified the Bulgarian Government that he has infor
mation of the place where the abductors of Miss
Stone are concealing her, and has demanded that
the Government cease any further negotiations with
the bandits and proceed at once to make a vigorous
effort for her rescue. The new movement on the
part of the American representative is said to be due
to a conviction on his part that it is impossible to
make terms with the brigands so long as they deem
themselves safe from pursuit; but that if troops sur :
round the place where they are in hiding, or even
make a strong demonstration against them, they will
weaken and surrender their captive for a much less
ransom than they have hitherto demanded.
It is hardly worth while to discuss just how much
credence should be given to that story. It is not im
probable. Miss Stone has now been in captivity for
many weeks. It was at first announced by her cap
tors that the ransom they demanded must be forth
coming "immediately" or she would be put to death.
It was not forthcoming immediately, nor, it seems,
has the full amount they demanded been forthcoming
even to this day. There have been negotiations
through some sort of channel with the bandits and
efforts have been made to induce them to accept a
less sum than was at first demanded. It appears they
have refused, but they have not broken off negoti
ations. Under such circumstances it is not at all
unlikely the American Minister has found among the
associates of the kidnapers some one to betray the
place where the captive is confined and also to point
out the means by which her rescrie could be safely
effected.
So far as the circumstances of the affair can be
judged from this distance, it appears our Government
has a valid claim against the Bulgarian Government
for the wrong inflicted upon the captive missionary.
We have had the humiliation of having a ransom
exacted from our people without being able to hunt
out the brigands who extorted it. When it was an
nounced that the ransom must be paid or Miss Stone
would be put to death a call was made for contribu
tions to the fund and the response was prompt and
generous. For some time past we have heard of no
further calls for money, so it is fair to assume that
the ransom is no longer the chief question in the
situation. Evidently there are other difficulties in the
way, and it would seem that with them the Bulgarian
Govcrnmtnt will have to deal; or Uncle Sam will
know the reason why.
Because a musician was elected Mayor in San
Francisco the envious East is trying to keep even by
directing attention to the fact that an undertaker was
elected Mayor in Jersey City.
DUELING IN GERMANY.
GERMAN army officers are having a hard time
by reason of the conflict between the laws and
the customs of their army in reference to
dueling. The case of Lieutenant Hilderbrand, who
the dispatches from Berlin announce has been sen
tenced to court-martial to two years' imprisonment
for killing Lieutenant Blaskowitz, affords a striking
illustration of the dilemma which confronts them.
The case has excited a good deal of interest in Ger
many by reason of its pathetic features. Blaskowitz,
who was on the eve of his wedding, attended a sup
per at which he with others drank too much, and on
his way home became quarrelsome and struck two
brother officers, who were taking him to his quarters.
Next day the case was reported to a court of honor
of the regiment, and the officers who were struck were
commanded to challenge. Blaskowitz, who, it seems*
had no recollection cf the affair, was spending the
evening with his fiancee when he received a telegram
calling him back to the regiment to fight. He offered
to apologize, but the court of honor refused to admit
it. He had two challengers to meet and had he es
caped the first he would have had to stand up before
the other. He was killed, it appears, at the first fire,
and honor was satisfied.
A few years ago it is probable there would have
been no further proceedings in the matter, but of late
the consequences of dueling and the outrageous bar
barism of the decrees of the so*called courts of honor
have aroused the German conscience and a deter
mined effort hasbeen made by some of the foremost
men in the empire to put an end to the practice. They
have not yet succeeded, but they have accomplished
enough, it seems, to punish to some extent those who
kill an antagonist in a duel. Lieutenant Hilderbrand
has been caught in this double trap. The regimental
court of honor compelled him to fight his friend to
the death for a blow which among any other people
would never have been thought of again by either
party. He killed his friend, and now he must go to
jail for two years.
The Texas judge who, when. defeated by the popu
lar vote, ordered a recount in his own court and then
counted himself in, may now be forced to complete
the job by issuing an injunction forbidding any at
tempt to lynch him.

Cuban English.
Since the -war -with Spain and the occu
pation of Cuba by the United States Ha- ,
vana merchants have almost completely j
revolutionized their business methoda.
Many of them employed English speaking
clerks and correspondents, but from the
following circular, which has been wide
ly distributed in New York, it is evident >
that the writer might have been more j
easily understood If he had written in |
Spanish:
"NEVER before there was so good a j
ehanse to get the highest brands in Ha
vana Cigars as we offer!!
"HAVANA, June 22. 1901.

New London Fad.
It Is said that a number of London's so
ciety people have recently taken up the
"barefoot fad," and that many of the
children of the world's metropolis are now
using sandals Instead of the conventional
footgear.
Opinions as to the real benefit to be
derived from this custom vary, and while
! some physicians hold that it will accom
plish great good, others declare that it is
at least useless and may be the cause of
actual disease among children whose feet
are too tender for such practices. It is
claimed by many people that boots and
shoes cause various deformities in the
feet of children and are responsible for
much suffering. This is denied by others,
however, who hold that the danger from
injury to the bare foot more than counter
balances the harm which can be done by
modern shoes.

FIVE SCORE MINERS MEET DEATH
IN BLAZING COLORADO GOLD MINE
Fire Quickly Destroys the Buildings at the Mouth of the Smuggler-
Union, and Deadly Gas and Smoke Overcome the Unfortu
nate Men at Work in Shaft and Tunnels.
Five score of underground workers are believed to have perished in one of the most disastrous mining horrors in the his
tory of Colorado. The fire started in the buildings at the mouth of the tunnel through which the Smuggler-Union mine is worked,
and the mine was soon filled with deadly gas and smoke. In an effort to shut off the draft the management of the mine caused rock
to be blasted into the tunnel, but this was done too late. Had it been done when the fire was first discovered, all the imprisoned
men might have escaped.
TEI.T/TRIDE, Colo., Nov. 20
Â¦\Yhat is likely to prove the most
disastrous accident that has ever
occurred in a metallic mine in
Colorado resulted to-day from a
fire which burned the buildings at
the mouth of the' Bullion tunnel, through
which the Smuggler-Union mine is
worked, and which tilled the mine with
deadly gas and smoke. It is imposÃible
to give even an approximate estimate of
the loss of life, but it is believed that It â¢
will reach nearly, if not quite, one bun- '
dred. Twenty-two are known to have
perished.
The fire started about 7 o'clock this
morning from a defective flue in the
bunk house at the mouth of the tunnel.
It quickly communicated with the othor
buildings. The dense emoke from the
burning converter house, which was sat
urated with oil, begun pouring into the
tunnel, which, with the shafts of tho
mine, acted as a chimney.

and before they could be warned of their
danger the levels and slopes were filled
with smoke and gas.
As soon as the men became aware, of
their danger efforts were made to reach
the surface through various exits, and
about half of those in the mine escaped.
It will be impossible to ascertain the

American Marines Cap
ture a Stronghold
in Samar.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â The following
cablegram has been received at the Navy
Department from the commanding officer
of the Asiatic station, dated Cavlte, No
vember 20:
"Waller reports that on the 17th
marines attacked an almost impregnable
position at Sojoton, Samar, destroying
three camps, killing thirty men, capturing
forty bamboo guns, rice and stores. He
reports no casualties and commends Por
ter, Beard and other officers.
"RODGERS."
MANILA, Nov. 20.â Major L. T. W.
Waller of the Marine Corps has cabled
Rear Admiral Rodgers at Manila a fulT
and detailed account of the attack on No
vember 17 by the men of his command
upon the rebel strongholds at Sojoton,
near Basi, island of Samar.
Poison on the Spears.
Three insurgent camps were destroyed,
forty bamboo cannon were captured and
much rice and other stores were de
stroyed. The rebel stronghold was almost
impregnable. The trails leading to it were
lined with poisoned spears sticking from
the ground and were filled, with hidden
pitfalls.
Major Waller's command attacked the
enemy unexpectedly. To do this they had
to scale a cliff 200 feet high. This they
climbed barefooted over bamboo ladders.
At the top they found boulders piled ready
t.O precipitate upon an attacking party.
Major Waller says he was personally
not present at the action. He praises Cap
tain David G. Porter and Captain Hiram
I. Beard for their splendid work and says
too much praise cannot be given to the
marines themselves, whoso behavior he
characterized as brilliant in every respect.
The major considers the scaling of cliffs
200 feet high as a new feature of warfare
and says such men would be able to do
anything anywhere. Thirty of the enemy
were killed. The marines sustained a few
trifling wounds.
Hear Admiral Rodgers has replied to
Major Waller, congratulating him on the
successful action by his command.
Agruinaldo Would Explain.
Aguinaldo has written to General Chaf
fee, the Military Governor of tho Philip
pines, asking the latter's permission to go
before Congress and express the desires of
the Filipino people. Aguinaldo further re-
Quests to be accompanied by eight friends,
whom he designates, four of whom are
prisoners at Guam, while the others are
prominent in Manila.
Sixto Lopez, who has been In the United
States and in Europe in the interest of
Filipino matters and who is now at Hong
kong, has written to Governor Taft ask
ing to be exempted from taking the oath
of allegiance to the United States on his
arrival at Manila, asserting that this ac
tion might injure his labors In behalf of
peace.
A fund is being raised by the Federal
party in Manila for the purpose of at
tempting to prevent the execution of Fili
pino General Isadoro Torres, who sur
rendered to the American authorities in
the early part of this year and who was
later tried on charges of having violated
the rules of warfare and sentenced to
death. Several Congressmen will be
asked to exert their influence in favor of
General Torres.
SUPERSTITIOUS NATIVES
AT MIDNIGHT MASSACRE
Deaths From Whooping Cough in
New Guinea Cause Wholesale
Murder.
LONDON, Nov. 20.â Lieutenant Gov
ernor George R. L. Hunt, in his annual
report on New Guinea, tells a curious
story of native superstition which is caus
ing the pacrifice of innumerable lives.
It appears that whooping cough was in
troduced by two white children and spread
with frightful rapidity. It first swept the
coasts and is now ravaging the interior.
As the natives hold that death from
whatever cause is always compassed by
an unknown enemy, only discoverable
through witchcraft, whenever a village
is attacked with whooping-cough a sor
cerer is consulted. The latter invariably
designates another village as culpable,

Thought He Killed His Wife.
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â Believing that
he had mortally wounded his wife while
shooting at a fancied burglar, William
D. Brockman, a linotype operator living
in Austin, turned his revolver upon him
self and committed suicide. As a pre
caution against burglars Brockman al
ways slept with a revolver under his pil
low. Early this morning, imagining he
saw an intruder at the window of hl3
bedroom, he fired. The bullet passed
through the pillow close beside his wife's
head. Frantically he asked her if he had
killed her. She replied sleepily that he
had not but was too late to save his life.
Trainmen Hurt in a Wreck.
SCHUYLER, Neb., Nov. 20.â A serious
freight train wreck occurred on the Union
Pacific at Benton, thirty-five miles west
of here, early to-day. Fireman C. B
Hodgson received serious internal injur
ies and a tramp named R. Heden had a
leg crushed. Five other members of the
crew were considerably bruised, but none
wag seriously hurt. Two engines and five
loaded cars were demolished. The acci
dent was caused by an open switch.
curred to the management to shut oft the
draft by blasting rock into the tunnel. It
is believed by mining men that had this
been done as soon as the fire started all
loss of life might have been averted.
The property loss is about $50,000, fully
covered by insurance.

CAPTIVE'S LIFE
Southern Posse Holds
Alleged Slayer of
Deputies.
OXFORD, Mias., Nov. 20.â Will Mathis
who is charged with the murder of two
deputy marshals, Montgomery by namt,
walked into the little town of Dallas,
twelve miles south of here, to-night and
surrendered to a Justice of the Peace and
two citizens.
Mathis had leen closely pursued by a
larga posse with bloodhounds, and realiz
ing that his c-a;>ture was certain the fugi
tive voluntarily gave himself up and
asked for protection. He was turned over
to the posse and started for Oxford, but
it is understood at a late hour to-night
that he will not be brought to this city.
The officers fear mob violence.
When the news reached Oxford the
streets were immed'ately filled with peo
ple and there was great excitement. Bon
tires were built and threats of summary
vengeance against the alleged murderer
Wf;re heard un a!! sides. The local officers
announce that they will protect the pris
oner at all hazards.
The two murdered deputies, brothers
named Montgomery, went to Mathis'
house to arrest him for alleged
moonshining. On the following day the
bodies of the two Montgomery^ wero
found in the ruins of Mathis' house, which
had been burned during the night. Mathis
fled, taking the horse of one of the depu
ties. He was traced to the Yocana bot
toms, where last night he was reported
to be surrounded by a posse of citizens
and officers.
Mrs. Mathis and three negroes are un
der arrest in Oxford, charged with com
plicity in the murders. Before a Cor
oner's jury they have related the detail 3
of the crime. The negroes under arrest
are George and Bill Jackson, brothers,
and Orlando Laster. The negro Laster
states that Mathis induced the officers to
spend the night at his house, and shot
them after they had yone to bed, Laster
holding the lamp. This negro procured
the gun for Mathis from Matt Owens.
Mathis' father-in-law. The latter leaded
the gun with buckshot before sending it
to Math!?.
A guard was placed around the County
Jail last night, as there were threats of
lynching the prisoners charged with be
ing accessory to the crime.
DEFENDS THE POLICY
OF FBANCE IN" CHINA
Premier Waldeck-Rousseau Makes a
Vigorous Address Before Cham
ber of Deputies.
PARIS, Nov. 19.â The Chamber of Depu
ties to-day continued the discussion of the
bill authorizing the loan of 265,000,000
francs in 3 per cent perpetual rentes, to
reimburse the treasury for its outlay in
connection with the Chineso expedition
and the indemnification of French suffer
ers in China.
M. Cailleaux, Minister of Finance, de
fended and explained the Government's
plan. He demanded the amount origin
ally asked for, and asserted that he did
not know the reasons which actuated the
commission in proposing the reduction to
210,000,000 francs until he saw the "report of
M. Hubbard. He declared that he had
had no opportunity to oppose the reduc
tion before tho budget committee.
M. Zemdt asked that the report of Gen
eral Voyron regarding the military oper
ations in China be submitted to the bud
get committee, In order that the commit
tee might know the facts of the case
with reference to the disorders and pil
lage attributed to the French troops.
M. Waldeck-Rousseau, the Premier,
made a forcible reply defending tho policy
of Franco in protecting French mission
aries in China. With reference to Gen
eral Voyron's report he said that, as
France was not alone in China, portions
of the report had been marked confiden
tial and would never bo published.
The Premier's speech produced a great
effect In the Chamber, and will probably
result in carrying the Government's
scheme practically unchanged. The de
bate was adjourned to Thursday.

Alahaman Who Was Thought to Be
a Corpse Has a Narrow
Escape.
DECATUB, Ala., Nov. 20.â James Winn,
supposed to be dead, came very near be
ing buried alive to-day. After the funeral
services the casket was opened at the
grave, when the body was seen to move.

ACCUSER TELLS
ABOUT MEADE
Major Lauchheimer Ex
plains Why He Made
Charges.
NEW YORK, Nov. 20. -The court-mnr-
Hal of Colonel R. E. Meade was resumed
to-day. Major Charles H. L.auchheimer
of the United States marine corps, who
preferred the charges against the ac
cused officer, took the stand and told
of a visit to the marine barracks la
Brooklyn on June 18 last for the purpose
of making an inspection, and stated that
Colonel Meade was on that occasion
under the influence of liquor and unfit for
duty.
There was a review of the battalion
that day and Colonel Meade made mis
takes while conducting the drill, and the
witness curtailed the drill when he saw
that Colonel Meade"s condition was buch
that it would be useless to continue It
Major Lauchheimer said when he re
luMied to Washington he reported tho
poor drill and the fact that Colonel
Mende was intoxicated.
On cross-examination Major Lauch
heimer said he made a close inspection,
but denied that Colonel Meade became ir
rlu-.ted because of his close Inspection
Witness said that his relations with Colo
rel Meade had been of a friendly nature
and he denied ever having told Captain
li.ane that he disliked the colonel.
Lieutenant Obrask testified that Re
took part In the battalion drill on June
18 and said that he observed Colon-1
Meade during the afternoon and that he
believed tho accused officer was iully
competent to perform his duties as com
manding officer.
Lieutenant John C. Beaumont of the
marine baYracks, Washington, was tho
next witness. Ho said that the manner
of Colonel Meade on June IS led him to
believe that the colonel was under the
influence of liquor, but he ascribed tÂ»3
poorness of the drill not only to tne
condition of the commanding officer but
also to the fact that the men were tir^d
after a lengthy inspection.
Lieutenant K. W. Dickman of the ma
rine barracks. Portsmouth. N. H wa3
also examined as to the occurrences on
the afternoon of June 18, and he said
that. Judging from his manner, Colonel
li uor 6 Wa3 sl!ghtly under the influence of
Lieutenant T. Fryer testified that he
noticed that Colonel Meade showed by
his voice and manner that he was in
ebriated en the afternoon in question.
Tho couit adjourned until to-morrow

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â N0 cre
dence is placed by officials of the
State Department in the report that
Consul General Dickinson has asked the
Bulgarian Government to use force to ef
fect the rescue of Mi?s Stone. The au
thorities say that such action would be
contrary to the instructions given to
Dickinson and the course he has hitherto
pursued.
SOFIA, Nov. 20.â The Foreign Office
here resents the insinuations published
abroad that the Government is acting in
bad faith in the matter of effecting tho
release of Miss Stone and, explaining its
attitude toward Dickinson, the diplomatic
agent here of the United States, affirms
its entire readiness to take any action
suggested by him.
The Foreign Office also says, acting
on the suggestion of Dickinson, it caused
the village of Gratchowo to be surrounded
and searched a fortnight ago, but tha
brigands were not there. It also says
that Dickinson's later information to tha
effect that the bandits were concealed
in a defile of the Belleritza mountains
could not be acted upon by it, as an in
quiry showed the place in question to be
within Turkish territory.
The latest intelligence received herÂ© sets
forth that the brigands are holding out
for a higher figure of ransom and it is
asserted that they are able to keep their
captives as long as this may be neces
sary.
Dickinson, according to tho Vezerna
Posta, whose editor was a member of the
former Macedonian committee, has sent
an ultimatum to the brigands, giving
them six days td accept a specified sum
as the ransom for Miss Stone. If this
amount is not accepted within tho time
mentioned Dickinson's offer will be with
drawn.

hole through an eighteen inch atone wall
and walked away. Their absence was
not noticed until several hours after and
no trace of the escaped prisoners haj

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â 1t waa announced
to-day at the White House that Postmaster
Wilson of Brooklyn has resigned and that his

CALIFORNIA PREPARES TO VOICE PROTEST AGAINST
THE INVASION OF AMERICA BY YELLOW HORDES OF ASIA
People of Pacific Coast Unite to
Ask Re-enactment of the
Exclusion Law*
j*^ ALIFORNTA to-Â«3ay will declare
/f in no uncertain terms her oppo-
CALIFORNIA to-Â« Jay immigration.
in no uncertain terms her oppo
sition to Chinese immigration.
The Geary act. under which at
present Chinese are excluded from
the United States, expires in the early
part of 1902 and a State convention will
meet this afternoon in Metropolitan
Temple to renew the figSU that under
twenty years of exclusion has been slum
bering.
Chinese exclusion Is to-day the para
mount issue on the Pacific Coast. All the
resources of Chinese diplomacy are at
wcrk to secure the withdrawal of the
barrier of exclusion. In Washington Min
ister Wu Ting Fans has made his pres
ence felt, while in San Francisco, the main
center of opposition. Ho Vow, the Chinese
Consul General, has sought by the aid or
Oriental diplomacy to bring the people
around to his way of thinking.
Although for twenty years California
has not been called upon to publicly ex
press her sentiments on the question of
exclusion, the spirit that actuated the
men who drafted the first act burns
strong among the delgates. The old
slogan â "The Chinese must go," is as
potent to-day as it was when the people
first rallied to the cry. Conditions are
somewhat different in the political world,
but the economical conditions that govern
the great Western slope of the United
States are the same. ' - . -
Opposition to Chinese Immigration.
In the Constitutional Convention that
met in Monterey in 1849 California de
clared herself in no uncertain tones
against the Chinese. In the legislatures
that followed the same course was pur
sued. In IS6S the Burlingame treaty was
ratified and hordes of Asiatics invaded
California. But the fight was not lost.
The Legislature of the State sent Philip
A. Roach and Flrank M. Pixley to Wash
ington to fight for exclusion. These com
missioners laid the foundation stone of
the present law. Roach took with him
the text of a bill which afterward formed"
the basis of the Geary act. Scott of Penn
sylvania sponsored it for a time, but the
holes that the United States Supreme
Court knocked in the measure were so
many that a new measure became neces
. sary.
Geary, in the full power of his young
manhood, jumped into the breach and dur
ing his meteoric career in the House of
Representatives succeeded in securing the
passage of the present law. Although de
fective in many points, it has subserved"
its purpose ana will form the basis of a
new law, to be presented at the coming
session of Congress. As a tribute to the
work done by Geary he will probably be
elected permanent chairman of the con
vention.
Some regret has been expressed that
Governor Gage, unmindful of the duty
that he owes to the State in the present
serious condition of affairs, should have
expressed his intention of being 1 absent
from .the convention. Governor Gage's
"slap" at the people of the State. whose
interests he was elected to conserve, will
be more than offset, however, by the
presence of the Governors of adjacent
{States, who are alive to the interests of
the people.
Voice of Labor Will Be Heard.
One element that will assume a promi
nent part in the convention is that repre
senting labor. No body of men is more
interested in the outcome than the labor
ers and mechanics, for year after year the
Chinese have been invading the various
lines of trade. Labor therefore feels that
it has a just grievance and the men repre
senting the trades unions will speak fully
their minds upon the question.
The convention will be one of the most
representative ever held in California.
From Orejren to the Mexican line, from
the Nevada and Arizona boundaries to
the vaters of t'ne Pacific Ocean, delegates
will attend. Every class interest, every
business industry embraced within the
confines of the State will be represented.
United States Senators Perkins and Bard
will attend with several Congressional
Representatives of the State.
The convention will undoubtedly tax
the limits of the Metropolitan Temple.
The seating capacity of the hali Is In the
neighborhood of 1500. but the list of dele
gates approaches that number. The or
ganization of the convention will prob

Mclaughlin tilled in the- gaps and drew
conclusions from the facts that had a
tinge of favor to Noyes. When he reached
k*. T. Hume he denounced him. "If
Humes testimony be believed," he said,
"and if ho is an attorney of this court.
then he must be disbarred. Is he fitted
for tne society of decent gentlemen? Is
he fitted to be a practitioner of the court?
On the testimony of this man you are
asked to destroy the character of the

villainous piece of manufacture."

was not present, extolled his ancestors.

OIL PROMOTERS
SUE EACH OTHER
Transactions of Peculiar
Character Come
to Light.
The trial of the suit of Dr. F. M.
Archer against Heinrich Mellman before
Justice ot the Peace Daniels yesterday
disclosed the peculiar operations of the
Mendocino Paramne Oil Company, of
which Archer is president and Mellman
secretary.
Me llman sued Archer for J254, alleged to
be half of the amount expended to ex
ploit' the oil scheme. The testimony de
veloped that while the concern had se
c-ireu an option on lands in Mendocino
County, no attempt 'had been made to
â¢Â¦/i>- . c â¢ i. ..... in.- ...;....,* tual laci..
samples cf oil purporting to have been
taken from the company's wells were
sent broadcast throughout the country,
some of them and a large quantity of
the stock having even reached Australia.
The testimony developed the fact that
many shares of the stock were unloaded
f n J. G. Burg.bacher, a German resident
of Redding, who gave his note for $1000
to pay for the same. The note was in
doised by "F. ML Archer, president," but
Mellman, to escape responsibility, signed
It "Mendocino Oil Company, per H. Mell
man as secretary."
Burgbacher, who realized that he had
paid for worthless stock, brought suit to
restrain Mellman from negotiating the
note, but the latter testified that he had
sold it to G. S. Clark for $800, and a
case of probable contempt is now pending
against Meilman.
When Mellman sued Archer, the latter
put in a counter-claim for $266, being
a third of the proceeds realized by Mell
man on the sale of the note. Judge
Daniels held that Archer's contention
was correct and gave him judgment for
the amount of his counter claim, but de
creed that he should pay Mullman $154
as his share of the expenses in floating
the oil stock.
To further complicate the matter
mother suit is pending in Judge Gra
ham's court, where one Holland, who in
turn bought Burgbacher's note from
Clark, is suing for the return of $800.
Barrett Convicted by Jury.
William Barrett, a. horseshoer, was
tried before a Jury in Judge Cook's court
yesterday on the charge of assault to
murder, and after hearing the testimony
the Jury brought in a verdict of guilty of
aftault with a deadly weapon, with a rec
ommendation to mercy. Barrett had a
dispute in March last with Alfred Brown,
a barber, at 562 1 /-: Howard street, about
some personal effects, and fired a shot at
him, the bullet inflicting a flesh wound on
the left side.

ASSASSIN KILLS SERVIA'S QUEEN,
SAYS A REPORT FROM BELGRADE
Draga, the Former Lady-in- Waiting Who Married Young Alex
ander, May Be Dead, and There Is Certainty That
a Crisis Exists at the Capital*
VIENNA, Nov. 20.â An unconfirmed report that has
reached Vienna is that Queen Draga has been shot
at In the streets of Belgrade. The Neve Freie
Presse and other Vienna papers publish various
rumors, one declaring that the Servian Queen was
assassinated; another that she was wounded, and a third
that she committed suicide. Reports from other sources
deny the statement that Queen Draga was killed and as
sert that the rumor of her death was caused by a hysteri
cal scene with King Alexander.
There is no reliable information on the subject here, but
it is generally believed that a serious crisis exists in Bel
grade.
PARIS, Nov. 21.â According to a dispatch from Vienna
to the Echo de Paris, an attempt has been made to assas
sinate the Queen of Servia, three shots having been flred
at her while she was driving near Semlln.
A dispatch to the same paper from Belgrade gives a
rumor that the Queen attempted suicide at Semlin.
Queen Draga was formerly Mme. Maschin, a widow,
and had been a lady-in-waiting to King Alexander's moth
er, the unfortunate Queen Natalie. Mme. Maschin was of
obscure birth, twelve years older than the young ruler, who
took the throne when his father, the notorious King Milan,
abdicated in 1899.
King Alexander's liking for Mme. Maschin had been
known tfor a long time in court circles, but the announce
Paper Company Sued for Damages.
William Cashion, who claims to have
been injured so severely at the works of
the Floriston Pulp and Paper Company
in Nevada County that he has been ren
dered incapable of earning a living, filed
a suit against the firm yesterday for
$25,000 damages. In his complaint he al
leges that he was injured by reason of
having to work between two machines
placed so close together as to render
an accident liable at any time. He al
leges that the placing of the machines
in such a position was a piece of care
lessness, and that therefore the company
is liable.

ment of his betrothal to her in July, 1900, caused a great
sensation. The Servian Ministry promptly resigned, de
claring the proposed marriage preposterous and a menace
to the state.
Ex-King Milan heard the news at Carlsbad and im
mediately telegraphed his resignation as commander of the
Servian army. He also started at once for Belgrade, but
the young King again showed his spirit. He sent officers
to the frontier to prevent his father's return and organ
ized a new Ministry.
Sweeping aside all opposition. King Alexander married
Mme. Maschin in Belgrade, August 5, 1900. Though the
marriage had been so vigorously opposed officially, the peo
ple seemed to have no objection, and the bridal party was
heartily cheered. The King had taken the precaution, how
ever, to have the streets lined with troops.
The domestic affairs of the King dropped from public
attention until it was whispered early in this year that an
heir was expected to the Servian throne. In May there
was a scandal when it was announced that the expectation
was without foundation. Queen Draga was accused of a
willful deception of the King, and it was announced that
he was furious with her. Public opinion was divided as
to whether she was suffering from hysteria or had at
tempted to dupe the King. It was said that the King in
tended to apply to the Holy Synod for a divorce, but he
did nothing, and the scandal finally was forgotten. Queen
Draga, however, had lost her popularity with the people.

CORONER'S JURY
ACCUSES RILEY
Charges Him With the
Brutal Murder of
Otto Ekberg.
"One Riley" stands accused by the ver
dict of a Coroner's Jury of the murder of
Otto Ekberg, a non-union teamster who
was killed November 9 on Townsend
street by being struck on the head with
an iron roller. The roller was produced
before the jury and was seen to be a
most deadly weapon- It was two feet
long, two inches in its transverse diame
ter and half an inch thick.
By "One Riley" the jury evidently
meant John G. Riley, a union teamster,
who is under arrest for the murder.
The identifying witness in the case was
Mrs. Aima Miller of No. 32 Clyde street.
â¢The man I saw strike Ekberg with the
gas pipe," said Mrs. Miller, "is sitting
there," and she pointed straight at the
accused. She proceeded to tell that on
the night of the murder she was return
ing home with a basket of groceries, when
she saw Ekberg about eight feet ahead of
her, walking toward Fourth street. It
was about 6 o'clock and quite dark. The
next thing she saw was the form of a
man walking toward Ekberg and this
man when ne got alongside of Ekberg
struck him on the head with an iron pipe
felling his victim to the sidewalk. Then
throwing his murderous weapon clanging
into the street, the murderer passed
within six feet of her and disappeared
around the corner into Ritch street. Mrs
Miller turned as i.c passed her and took
a good look at his back. It was too dark
to see his face, but the man's form from
the rear was indelibly impressed upon her
mind. After Riley was arrested she was
taken to the City Prison, where she
picked him out of a row of five men
Outside of this the principal evidence
against the accused were threat 3 made
by Riley some time before the murder
He told one witness that it was a wonder
that somebody did not get away with Ek
berg some night when he was hansrtnsr
around the stables. Shortly after that
implied threat was made Ekberg was at
tacked on Grant avenue by a gang of un
ion teamsters. *
Did Not Play in Cafe Royal.
Robert W. Duijsinuir, the mining man
who was a victim of card sharpers on
Monday evening last, did not play cards
in the Cafe Royal. The two men who
played with him invoiced him to a card
game on Ellis street and robbed him at
their leisure. The sharperg were badiy
fooled. They thought Dunsmuir hid
ready money, and in order to ingratiate
themselves into the *ood graces of their
victim loaned him $20, which they won
along with the money and checks.

Superintendent Webster filed his month
ly report on the conditions existing in the
schools as his deputies found them. The
report says:
In many previous reports I have directed at
tention to the miserable condition of the Wash,

mended that the present structure be demolish
ed and a commodious building of eighteen
roerr.s ba constructed for the accommodation
of pupils ho attend or desire to attend this
rcliool. A new class is needed at this build
ing, as applicants tor admission have been
turned away.
rAt the Laguna Honda School there are too
f many pupils for each teacher, when the num
ber of grades each has to teach is taken into
(.or.Eideration. Theretore, the formation of a
new class is recommended.
The attendance at the Emerson Primary
School is reported large and crowded, there be

that the building be enlarged.
Deputy Superintendent Kingsbury states that

SYBIL SANDERSON MEETS FRIENDS
AT A TEA GIVEN IN HER HONOR
Old-Time Acquaintances Greet Celebrated Singer at Function at the
Residence of Mrs* George C Boardman*
MADAME SIBYL SANDERSON
TERRY was the guest oi
honor at a tea given yesterday
afternoon by Mrs. George C.
Boardman at her elegant
home, corner of Sacramento
and Franklin streets.
The uncertainty of the great singer's
leisure time made the arrangements for
the tea hurried, and the affair therefore
rather informal in its details. Invitations
had to be given by telephone and the re
ceiving party asked a: very short notice,
but otherwise so elaborate were the ar
rar.gemtnts that the reception might have
beer a most formal affair.
About 150 ladies were asked to meet the
famous singer. Mi?t of those invited were
old friend? of Mrs. Terry and the reunion
was a most pleasing one, both for the
cnest of honor and the visitors. The home
was beautifully decorated for the occa
sion. In the handsome drawing room palo
pink blossoms, roses and carnations wer?
useri with mc.Â«t artistic effect. In th^
library yellow chrysanthemums were used
for decorative purposes, and the elegant
diring room was brilliant with a decora
tion of madrone berries and autumn
leaves.
Mrs. Boardman. in rp^eiving her guest?,
was assisted by Mrs. James Keeney, Mrs.
Bowie Dietrick. Mrs. Alexander Keyes,
Mrs. W. R. Smedberg Jr., Mrs. G. Me-
Ivor. Miss Margaret Salisbury and Miss

COMMISSIONERS
FAIL TO AGREE
Judge Wallace of Police
Board Changes His
Mind.
Indications That Chief Will
Be Appointed Within
Ten Days.
Judge William T. Wallace blocked the
appointment of a Chief at the session of
the Board of Police Commissioners Tues
day night last. The Commissioners by
Informal exchange of views had arrived
at the general conclusion that an execu
tive officer should be chosen without de
lay, as there was a feeling of unrest in
the department. A day or two prior to
Tuesday it was well understood that
three of the Commissioners were ready
to act on the question of filling the va
cancy caused by the death of Colonel
Sullivan. Judge Wallace was supposed
to favor the appointment of Captain
Wittman, and it was contended that
Commissioners Newhall and Howell
would extend their approval of this se
lection. It was quite well known that
Commissioner Mahony would oppose the
promotion of Wittman, but would not in
terpose other resistance to the filling of
the vacancy.
Tuesday night at the regular session
of the board the president of the Com*
mission suggested that the question of
appointing a Chief be taHen up. Judge
\allace aid not enter a formal protest,
but Baid in a commonplace way, "Let
us defer that matter and proceed with
the regular business on the calendar.'
When \Vallace thus signified that he was
not ready to vote the inference was read
ily drawn that he had not made up his
mind as to the merits of the men men
tioned for Chief, or had made it up and
changed it. Whatever may be the in
side impres&ion, the outside conjecture
Is that Judge Wallace yielded to per
suasive pressure and In the parlance of
tne push "fell down."
Wallace May Be Reappointed.
One story goes that Wallace received
assurance of reappointment to the board
under Mayor Schmitz's administration.
Another story is to the effect that Mayor
Phelan urged him to defeat the appoint
ment of \vittman.
The common impression that Mahony s
term as Commissioner expires before that
of Judge Wallace is not correct. A mis
print in a guide or directory created this
erroneous notion. Judge Wallace's term
will expire on January 8 next. He may
be reappointed by Mayor Schmitz. He is
recognized as an able, masterful man,
and known to be an old resident. Law
yers have a profound regard for his
knowledge of the law â so profound that
they will accept his opinions against their
own judgment. On the Supreme bench
he prepared opinions for his associates to
tign and they frequently signed them,
because Wallace ' with a broad assertive
sweep indicated that there was nothing
else to do but sign.
Perhaps there was nothing lordly or
domineering in his decree to the Police
Commission that the question of appoint
ing a Chief should be deferred. It is
by no means certain that his fellow-Com
missioners would stand any bluffing, be
cause of late years the bluffs of the
Judge have been successfully called in
the Board of Regents and in other high
and influential circles. No oae in or out
of the Police Commission disputes Judge
Wallace's right to be slow in making up
his mind or his right to change it after
having made it up. Wise men do change
their opinions and Wallace may be wise in
his day and generation.
The best information obtainable is that
an appointment of a Chief will be made
by the board within ten days. It is said
that Judge Wallace will not imperil his
chances of reappointment to the board by
voting for any one other than Wittman.
The men who are leading the fight
against Wittman's promotion appear to
have abandoned the proposition to defer
action until the inauguration of the new
Mayor. They now simply ask the ap
pointment of any one but Wittman. Sey
mour, Spillane, Dman and Dunlevy are
said to be acceptable.
Many Rumors in Circulation.
Common rumor that Newhall and How
ell regard Wittman as the right man and
stand ready to appoint him may be cor
rect, but neither Commissioner will au
thorize The Call to publish- the statement
as fact. They do recognize, however, that
there is a vacancy in the executive office
at the department which should be filled.
The board, in its official capacity, has not
discussed the vacancy, but informally
opinions have been Interchanged. After
reflection and further consideration, New
hall and Howell may change their minds
and give their support to some man ac
ceptable to Mahony or Wallace. The pub
lic is not clamoring for the appointment
of any particular man, but is simply sur
prised at the indecision or indifference
of the Board of Police Commissioners.
Captain Wittman has not asked the Com
mission for the appointment or even sig
nified that he wanted the position. Hia
record is before the commission and the
people. He stands ready to obey orders
and serve in whatever capacity his su
perior officers direct. The newspapers
that criticise him for accepting a gift
from the business men of the city had
no .comment to offer when certain appre
ciative citizens presented Outlaw Chris
Evaus with a Winchester rifle. Certainly
Judge Wallace has a right to change bis
mind concerning Captain Wittman aVid
surely San Francisco has a right to
change its mind about Judge Wallace,
and whoever supposes that this town is
going to be run by a yellow newspaper
may get ready for a complete change of
mind.
BOARD OF EDUCATION
CANNOT DELEGATE POWER
Judge Hunt Decides That Its Presi
dent Cannot Suspend a
Teacher.
The demurrer to the petition for a writ
of prohibition restraining the Board of
Education from suspending Miss M. C.
McKinney from her position in the Sher
man Grammar School until she has been
tried on the charges preferred by Prin
cipal Albert Lyser was overruled by
Judge Hunt yesterday. The Board of
Education demurred to the petition on
the ground that the complaint did not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action and that the court had no juris
diction over the Board of Education.
Judge Hunt holds that the board in
vesting the power of suspension in the
president of the board violated a well de
fined principle of the law. which pro
vides that a board acting judicially has
not the right to delegate the power
which under Certain conditions it has of
suspending a teacher against whom
charges have been preferred.
Emergency Hospital Changes.
The marriage of Miss Margaret Ber
tram, matron of the Harbor Hospital, to
Police Officer John T. Edner of the water

pointed assistant steward. Miss Wynne
will assist her Eister at the Central Hor
pital, and Mrs. Annie Andrews will be
stationed at the Harbrr Hospital.
Denman Still After His Fee.
William Denman yesterday applied to
the Superior Court for a writ of mandate
compelling Superintendent of Schools R.
H. Webster to affix his signature to a
demand for $500 for legal services ren
dered the Board oÂ£ Education. This is
Denman's third attempt to secure his fee.
An alternative writ returnable before
Judge Seawell November 29 was issued
by Judge Dunne.

HEAVY RAINFALL VISITS
CITY AND ITS VICINITY
Continuance of Wet Weather Pre
dicted for Central and Northern
California To-Day.
Yesterday's rainfall was heavy In San
Francisco, particularly during the early
evening, but the storm was confined to
a section of the State not more than a
hundred miles in diameter, with the bay
as a center. It originated just outside
the heads and took a course to the north,
but turned toward the south as evening
approached.
The depth of rain which had fallen in
this city at 6 o'clock last night was 38
of an inch, on Mount Tamalpais .43, at
Red Bluff 04 and at Sacramento .22.
Forecaster McAdie states that indica
tions point to the conclusion that the
central and northern portion of the State
will receive a thorough drenching, but
that the country to the south, which is
greatly in need of rain, will have to get
along "without it this time. It is expect
ed that the storm will last all through

again about midnight.

sign from the transport Meade or accept thÂ«
alternative of proceeding to sea with a crew
so reduced in number that the machinery could
not be operated with safety; therefore be it
Resolved. That we, as marine engineers, in
meeting assembled, unanimously indorse the
action taken by Chief Engineers George A.
Kolb and of John Cocbran and Assistant Engi

PECULIAR CONDITIONS
A.T ENTZMINOER HOME
Officials Suspect Mrs. McVicker of
Double Dealing With a Feeble-
Minded Woman.
Secretary White of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children allegoa
that a peculiar state of affairs exists at
the home of Lizzie Entzminger, whose
two children were recently placed in a
charitable institution.
Mrs. Entzminger is said to be weak
mentally. She has labored for years to
support herself and children, and has
lately been compelled to give up the
struggle, owing to sickness. Secretary
White sent her to the City and County
Hospital, but she did not care to remain
tnere and returned to her own abode.
Several attempts are said to have been
made by charitably inclined persons tv
relieve Mrs. Entzminger's financial dis
tress, but all have been met at the door
of the house by a Mrs. McVlckor. who
has informed them that the woman Is
dangerous and that charity is not accept
able, as she possesses property.
White says that no one is allowed to
see the sick woman, and he fears there is
something wrong. An investigation is
being made by the officials of the Ctoh
dren's Society and of the German Be
nevolent Association.
Accepts the Reduced Verdict.
A stipulation was filed yesterday in
the County Cleric's office whereby Hugh
Leroy Shea, who was awarded fcs,')oo
uamages for the death of his father, who
was killed while in the employ of the
Pacific Power Company, waived all claim,
tor J15.000 of that amount.
The attorneys for the company recently
moved for a new trial, â¢on the ground
that the sum awarded by the jury was
excessive, according to a decision of the
Supreme " Court to the effect that no
larger sum than the amount that th*? per
son killed could have earned in his natu
ral life If his life had not been cut *t>ort
should be awarded.
Judge Hunt* in passing on the motion
for a new trial held with the attorneys
for the defense and said he would grant
the motion unless Shea consented to ac
cept $10,000.
The company will in all probability ap
peal the case to the Supreme Court,
rather than pay the amount of the re
duced verdict.
A Defaulting Collector.
A warrant was procured from Judap>
Mogan yesterday for the arrest of Richard
Englander. collector of the Zeno Mauvais
Music Company, on the charge of mis
demeanor embezzlement. Ha is accused
in the complaint of embezzling $10, but It
is said there arc other amounts. He is
supposed to have left the city.
Murderer Gets New Trial.
The Supreme Court yesterday granted
another trial to Albert C. Enright, who
was convicted of murder in the second
degree in Inyo County last year. It was
held that the jurors had not been sum
moned in a legal manner and that wrong
instructions were given to them by :he
Judge.

Condition of Trade.
HOW THE COMMERCIAL SITUATION IS
VIEWED IN WALL STREET.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"Though there is a general feeling that we
are on the top wave of prosperity and that
a receding movement must soon set it, yet on
all sides we are confronted by evidences of
unprecedented industrial activity. Some
branches of the ircn trade are still '"booming"
at an astonishing pace, with no prospect of
early cessation, and railroad earnings continue
to show the most flattering increases over last
year's record-breaking returns. Agricultural
interests are also sharing general .prosperity,
and there is little complaint even from the dis
tricts where corn and cotton were most injured.
The truth is the United States, with its mag
nificent resources, has burst into one of those
periods of rapid new development such as
have more than once astonished the world,
and no one can tell when the climax has been
reached. Certainly the reaction in Germany.
while It should be taken as a warning, cannot
be accepted as a parallel, tor Germany is a
iully developed country and must react quickly
from excess, while the United States, through
sheer strength, can continue longer on the path
of development unhurt. The feeling of ap
prehension, or, more properly . speaking, con
servatism, which now exists is, however, one
of the best gafesuards against excess. It is
quite certain the present pace cannot last in
definitely and the cautious spirit is to be wel
comed and encouraged. General business and
credit are still sound and there will have to
be a very considerable overstraining of both
before any widespread reaction can take place
in Wall street. In the case of peculation
there is, however, particular reason for cau
tion: prices are very high, and when profits
begin to â¢r.e down to normal we may look
for corresponding movements in Stock Ex
change values. As is well known, there are
large quantities of stocks for disposal on every
rise, which means on the other hand that the
market will have the support of the big in
terests for some time to come. While these
conditions last there will be little material for
any prolonged bear campaign.
"The rr.cney market seems to be a subject
of some concern, chiefly because of gold ex
ports, which were partly responsible for Thurs
day's break. As funds are now returning from
the interior we can easily spare a few millions
to meet Europe's needs, and it remains to be
seen whether the release of securities held
through the Northern Pacific contest will ben
efit the money situation. A more serious
trouble is the- steady absorption of funds by
the treasury resulting from excessive taxation
and a faulty treasury system. Congress so far
has been derelict in its duty in not repealing
the war taxes. The public mind will soon be
centered upon the doings of Congress and may
show more or less uneasiness for a time. The
present outlook, however, is that no disturbing
legislation need be expected from this Con
gress and President Roosevelt is likely to be
much more conservative in office than on the
stump
"Our exports in October were unusually
heavy, although showing a loss of $17,700,000
compared with the same period In 1901. which
Â¦was one of the record-breakers. Our imports
also showed an increase of JIO,SOO,COO, so that
Â¦we had a trade balance of only $64,200,000,
aerainst $02, 700. 000 In October last year. The
decrease last month was chiefly owing to the
backward movement in cotton, which will of.
course be marie up later. Nevertheless the
frequency of smaller exports and smaller trade
balances is suggestive, even if due to depres
sion abroad rather than reaction at home.
Though we are growing in strength we cannot
escape the touch of foreign waves of depres
sion."

EASTERN MARKETS.
Xew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â The principal char
acteristic of to-day'B market was the decreas
ing interest shown, ( even by the professional
operators, who have 'had the market practically
to themselves for come time past. The fact
that no further gold would go out to-morrow
beyond the $f>oo,ooo engaged yesterday afforded
fome relief from the feeling of depression,
there having been apprehension that the French
eteamer Bailing to-morrow would carry away
several million dollars. The professional bulls
â¢Mfbt to stlisulate this into a renewed move
\
cient for the advance and in this intent there
was large buying and active manipulation of
a limited number of stocks lat the hands Â¦ of
speculative pools. The growing evidence of
a common purpose among the executives of
Northwestern States to combat the purposes
of the Northern Securities Company and to
seek the aid of legislation for that purpose had
an unsettling- effect upon sentiment. Much
remains to be cleared up regarding the actual
organization and operation of the settlement
which was the object of that company's forma
tion. The public is still absolutely uninformed
as to what securities or considerations have
been passed by which the Union Pacific was
allowed to share the control of the Burlington.
If the balance of power in the Northwest is
to be .maintained only by actual holdings in
the Northern Securities Company it Is not
clear how either of the parties can afford to
bring to market the bare minority of the hold-
Ings by which it was calculated there would
be a release of a part of the Immense capital
which was locked up in the struggle for con
trol. The transcontinental stocks generally con
tinued to show depression in spite of the ef
forts to get prices higher at other points.
The local traction stocks continued in large
demand, but were irregular on occasional real
izing and there was strength in the coalers,
New Jersey Central particularly rising 6% on
rumors of a coming increase of dividend. The
Vanderbilts developed marked strength at ad
vances of IS to 3 points. People's Gas was
forced down an extreme 3% to 98% in the late
dealings on the news of the heavy appraisement
for taxation fixed by the Illinois State Board
of Equalization. The American Locomotive
stocks suffered from realizing. Chicago. In
dianapolis and Louisville and St. Louis and
San Francisco were strong on reports of good
earnings. The money market was distinctly
easier to-day. Foreign exchange continues firm
and the opinion is still held that gold will go
out on Saturday to London direct.
Business in railroad bonds was not large
and the price movement was irregular. Total
sales. 12,295,000.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The foreign markets continued firm
and Paris and Liverpool futures were again
higher.
Chicago opened slightly easier all around,
but there was no selling pressure. Large
Northwestern receipts made the bulls cautious.
Soon afterward a sharp rally in coarse grains
led to renewed outside buying, and it looked
as if the public had taken the market away
from the professionals. Still later this outside
buying relaxed, and the poor spot demand lei
to local raiding. The room traders were most
ly bearish. The market closed several fractions
higher on the day.
The market was higher on call, but un
changed on the spot.

The weakness in Butter continues and the
tendency is still downward, with holders mak
ing concessions to keep their stocks down.
Cheese continues steady.
Another slight advance in ranch Eggs Is
noted, and the market is firm. The medium

AN EXPEDITION
Two San Francisco Boys,
Armed to the Teeth,
Invade Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 20.
Armed with rifles, weighted down with
ammunition aÂ«d financially backed by
part of a double eagle stolen from Mrs.
Feuton's purse, John Fenton, eleven
years old, and James Meagher, two years
older, yesterday left their San Francisco
homes on a filibustering expedition
through Contra Costa County. The storm
drove them into Oakland, where Detec
tive Shorey picked them. up. They re
crossed the bay this evening in the cus
tody of Meagher's mother.
Fenton, who lives with hla parents at
801 Golden Gate avenue, was the origi
nator and financier of the . expedition.
Young Meagher, whose home is at 748 Mc-
Allister street, "Just went along."
The boys left their homes yesterday
morning, presumably for school. Fenton.
towever, had provided himself with $20
from his mother's pocket book and easily
persuaded his friend James to be one of a
band of two in a hunt for fortune.
They purchased two rifles, cix boxes ot
ammunition and a dozen packages of
cigarettes. They crossed the bay on the
10 o'clock broad -guage boat.
"We was out to get anything we could
find; we wanted to be Jesse James or
Kobinson Crusoe, and if it hadn't rained
the cops would never have got us," is tha
way young Fenton summed up the adven
ture.
They got out in the country all right
and had shot two sauirrels when the
dovnpour caused a retreat to Oakland.
They spent the night in a" Ninth street
lodging house and were contemplating a
fresh start this morning when Detective
Shorey gathered them in. Their posses
sions, when arrested, consisted of two
rifles, four boxes of ammunition and $&.
Their parents were communicated with
and this afternoon Mrs. Meagher took the
runaways home.
Their destination, they said, was Santa
Cruz, and if necetsary they intended, by
capturing a team or a train, to equip
thf-rnselves with fitting transport. They
rvould have worked, young Fenton said,
if they had to. but not as long as their
ammunition held out.
Fenton's father is a Deputy County
Clerk in San Francisco.

TRIES TO KILL
SLEEPING SISTER
Murderous Attack by a
Suddenly Crazed
Woman.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 20.
Mrs. Maggie King suddenly became vio
lently Insane at an early hour this morn-
Ing and tried to throttle her sister, who is
a domestic in the employ of United States
Senator George C. Perkins. In the midst
of a sound sleep the sister was awakened
by the grip of strong hands upon her
throat. She soon realized that her an
tagonist was Mrs. King, with whom she
had been sleeping. With all her might
she tried to release herself from the
crashing grip of the woman, at the same
time screaming at the top of her voice so
that the other inmates of the house might
come to her rescue. Over and over the
women rolled, first on the bed and then
down upon the floor.
When finally assistance came the wo
men were lying fastened in each other's
arms and panting from exhaustion; their
clothing torn Into shreds. Senator Per
kins' coachman was the first to arrive on
the scene, and when other help came the
women were separated and Mrs. King
was bound hand and foot. Then, the np
lice were sent for and Detectives Shorey
and Mackey arrived in the patrol wagon
to take the maniac to the Receiving Hos
pital. On the way to the hospital Mrs.
King did not offer any resistance to the
officers.
Mrs. King has been the guest of her sis
ter for a week, having been invited to
come from her home In Fort Bragg,
where she first began to show signs of
dementia. She refuses to talk at all and
has eaten little food for a month. She is
the mother of five children, who are being
cared for by their father.

plans at once, but that officer reported
that the Naval Constructor was too busy
to take up t ;ie work. Admiral Bradford
then directed that plans be obtained from
private ship builders, and when these
were received he selected one and tele
graphed to the commandant, directing
him to contract for four coal barges of
the designated design.

Miss Sylvia M. Morgan and Miss Mar '

were attacked. They had been to a
friend's house, and were walking home
laughing ard chatting when, at the cot
r.er of Delaware and Walnut streets, i
man sprang out of the shadow of a trta
and made a grab for them. In his ai
tempt to seize the two both escaped ar-1

nearly a block they ran, fear giving thÂ»
young ladies sufficient speed to keep in

he has returned to his oM haunts*.

THE RIGHT THING.
A New Catarrh Cure, Which Is
Rapidly Coining to the Front.
For several years, Eucalyptol Gualcol
and Hydrastin have been recognized as
standard remedies for catarrhal troubles,
but they have always been given sepa-
rately and only very recently an Ingenious
chemist succeeded In combining them, to-
1 gether with other antiseptics, into a
pleasant effective tablet.
i Druggists sell the remedy under ths
name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and it
has met with remarkable success In the
I cure of nasal catarrh, bronchial and,
throat catarrh and in catarrh of tha
stomach. -
Mr. F. N. Benton, whose address is carÂ©
of Clark House. Troy. X. V.. says: "When
I run up against anything that is good I
like to tell people of it. I have been
troubled with catarrh more or less for
some time. Last winter more than ever.
Tried several so-called cures, but did not
get any benefit from them. About six
weeks ago I bought a 50 cent box of Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets and am glad to say
that they have done wonders for me and
I do not hesitate to let all my friends
know that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are
the right thing."
Mr. Geo. J. Casanova of Hotel Griffon,
West 9th street. New York City, writer:
"I have commenced using Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and already they haviÂ»
Riven me better results than any catarr'a
cure I have ever tried."
A leading physician of Plttsburg advises
the use of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets in
preference to any other treatment for
catarrh of the head, throat or stomach.
i He claims they are far superior to In-
halers, salves, lotions or powder, and are
much more convenient and Dleasant to
take and are so harmless that little chil-
d ren take them with benefit, as they con-
tain no opiate, cocaine or any poisonous
drugs.
All druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
| letr. at 30 cents for full size package and
; they are probably the safest and most "
j reliable cure for any form of catarrh.,

SPRING VALLEY
ANSWERS HEED
Tells Why Lobos Creek
Was Abandoned for
a Time.
Chief Engineer Schussler of the Spring
Valley Water Works has prepared a com
munication to the Board of Superv'sors
in which reply is made to the allegations
of Supervisor Reed that the company is
furnishing contaminated water from
Lobos Creek, a source, it was alleged,
that had previously been abandoned be
cause of contamination.
Denial is made of all of the charges.
The use of Lobos Creek water was dis
continued, It is explained, on March 10,
1893, because a landslide carried into the
sea a large part of the company's flume
on the Presidio reservation. As the land
slide kept moving It was impossible to
rebuild the flume, and the Government,
after extended negotiations, refused to
lease a site for a pumping plant. Recent-
Jy the company succeeded in purchasing
a tract of land from private parties' on
the south side of Lobos creek, near the
sea, and in leasing a right of way for a
road and a pipe-line connecting the tract
with Lake street. A pumping plant was
accordingly erected, a force pipe laid, and
tne Lobos Creek water again connected
with the city pipe system.
To demonstrate that the company is
not In straits to furnish the municipality
with water of any kind, Mr. Schussler
asserts that it has now stored in its res
ervoirs 8,633,000,000 gallons of water and
an additional supply of running water of
]5,000.000 gallons daily, and that the aver
age daily consumption is nearly 27,000,000
gallons daily. The company proposes to
increase the running water supply by
5,000,000 gallons per day. Mr. Schussler
asserts that additional water resources in
the country surrounding San Francisco
Bay can be developed for the require
ments of fully five times the present
population.
In reply to the charge that Lobos Creek
water is contaminated, a bacteriological
analysis of it by S. M. Mouser arid a
chemical analysis by E. W. Hilgard, and
for comparison a chemical analysis also
of Golden Gate Park water, are append
ed. The bacteriological report by Mouser
is as follows:
C. W. Howard, President Spring Valley
Water Company â Dear Sir: In compliance with
your request I have made a bacteriological
analysis of the water of Lobos Creek and frhd
it of good quality, containing but one hundred
and twenty micro-organisms to the cubic cen
timeter, which is far within the limit for water
for domestic purposes. None of these organ
isms are disease producers. Respectfully sub
mitted. S. M. MOUSER.
San Francisco, April 12, 1901.
Professor Hilgard says, under date of
September 2, 1901:
This water Is far within the limits for potable
water In all respects, although the nitrates are
somewhat high, doubtless In consequence of the
oxidization of the "albuminoid ammonia." But
the n.bytr.co of any considerable amount of
chtcrtn negatives the suggestion of ; ew.igo
contamination as the original source.
Bio de Janeiro Libel Case.
In the libel suit of Catherine Brady
and others, Judith Smith and others
vs. F. W. Jordan and the Board
of Pilot Commissioners, United States
District Judge de Haven allowed
the petitioners ten days' time In
which to file an amended complaint. The
suit was brought by Mrs. Brady and Mrs.
Smith, widows and minor children, to re
cover $100,000 for deaths caused by the
sinking of the steamer Rio de Janeiro
February 22. The complaint alleges that
the wreck was caused by the negligence
of Pilot Jordan In attempting to steer the
vessel Into the harbor during the preval
ence of a dense fog.
The Caldarella Feud.
Mike and George Caldarella and George
Orlando, their brother-in-law, charged
with assault to murder, appeared before
Judge Cabanlss yesterday. The case was
cr.llnued till next Wednesday afternoon.
Felipe Caldarella. who was supposed to
have been fatally shot by his nephew
George, is recovering and has been taken
from the Receiving Hospital to his home.
A. Mangini, who commenced the shoot
ing, has not yet been arrested.

LITRE DORIS'
FATE AT ISSUE
Japanese Child Actress
Subject of Court
Contest.
Doris Hannah Shumozumi ip the very
big name of a very little Japanese girl,
over whom a contest bringing into play
all the majesty of American law is being
waged in the Superior Court of this city.
Diminutive Miss Shumozumi's fate is in
the balance, for upon the decree of the
Judge who is hearing all about her case
depends whether she shall remain in the
United States, which has been her home
since infancy, and be brought up as a
Christian maiden, or shall be carried over
the seas to the land of her nativity, there
to become a "Madame Butterfly."
Doris Shumozumi is not an ordinary
Japanese child. She speaks English like
a native and has gained much local fame
as a dancer and child actress, her tutor
being Miss Susie de Angelis of 700 Cali
fornia street, formerly an actress of note,
and who has had charge of Doris nearly
all the time since she was fourteen
months old. She is only only 9 years of
age.
Mrs. De Angelis wants to retain pos
session of the little Americanized Jap
anese maiden who has proven so Intel
ligent and clever, and has asked to be
appointed her guardian. Doris Hannah's
parents want to take her away to Japan,
to which country they are going to live.
Doris' fate will be decided to-day, for
her parents are to sail to-morrow for
Japan.
The case was on in the Probate Court
yesterday, Mrs. De Angelis having ap
plied for a writ of habeas corpus, upon
which she hoped to obtain possession of
the child. The little one was in court
with her parents.
The first move to make Doris a perma
nent resident of America was unsuc
cessful. The writ of habeas corpus was
denied.
Mrs. De Angelis told the court how Dor
is' parents had brought her to her when
she was a mere mite and asked her to
care for the tot. She took the little one
because she did not think the parents
were fit custodians, she said, the mother
especially, leading a life that did not
qualify her to bring up children proper
ly, according to Mrs. De Angelis. The
parents paid $15 a month for the child's
maintenance. After three and a half
years they took her to Japan and
brought her back, placing her once more
In the custody of Mrs. De Angelis. who
then accepted $10 a month from them. The
money received from the Shumozumis
only sufficed to pay for Doris' clothes
and education, Mrs. De Angelis said.
Recently the parents again obtained
possession of the child.
Mrs. De Angelis, when asked as to how
much Doris earned when she performed,
informed his Honor that the child's sal
ary ranged from $8 to $20 a week, part
of which was earned by Nelta Fulton,
Mrs. De Angelis' granddaughter, who
furnished the music for the nimble-footed
little Jap.
Mrs De Angelis said that since learn
ing that the appearance of the Japanese
girl as a performer was objectionable
to several societies interested in the wel
fare of children she had refused to allow
?u r t0 _,^PPear, and was willing, in case
the child was placed In her custody, r to
stage C Â° Urt t0 keep her off the
Numerous witnesses testified as to Mrs.
De Angelis' kindness to Doris.

Heald Is somewhere off the Heads,
battling with the elements. Her
JX crew of two men were short of pro
visions when spoken by the pilot
boat Gracie S, which supplied their
wants. That was two days ago, however,
and as the captain expected to make port
in a few hours the chances are that they
are on short rations again.
The Cordelia Heald is the queerest look
ing craft that ever went to sea. She was
built by J. L. Heald in Oakland Creek and
named after his wife. He fitted her out
for a voyage to the Klondike, but when
he had her ready to start the crew re
fused to go out on her. Then Mrs. Heald
took command and finally got the vessel
away. Once outside the craft was found
to be topheavy and the crew insisted on
coming back to port. This was done and
after the deckload had been removed the
little vessel made a fresh start. This
time she was driven south to San Pedro
and there the gold hunters abandoned the
voyage.
For several months the Cordelia Heald
lay in San Pedro harbor and finally her
owner found a purchaser for her. The
new owner is a rancher, but thought he
could sail the craft to a place on the
Klamath River, where he knew there was
a rich quartz ledge. With the machinery
in the engine-room he hoped to erect a
mill and with the assistance of his deck
hands develop the mine. They made a
start from San Diego on September 21
and were driven back by heavy gales.
Recently she made another start and is
now in a sad plight. Nearly all the sails
have been blown away, the standing rig
ging is nearly all gone and the little ves
sel looks almost a wreck.
Captain Matthewson of the Gracie S
said.
I thought it was a derelict when I first saw
it. I went aboard and asked the captain if he
wanted a pilot. He said "No," as he could
make port without help. I told him it was
going- to blow, but he said his vessel went over
the waves like a cork and he had no fear.
They were out of tobacco and had been smok
ing coffee for several weeks, so we went back
to the pilot-boat and not only gave them to
bacco, but a quantity of other provisions. While
the Cordelia Heald is a steam vessel, still
there was no engineer and the crew of two
was depending upon the sails, nearly all of
which had been blown away. With sailors
aboard the vessel would probably have been
wrecked long ago, but with these two landsmen
for navigators she seems to have weathered
pales that would have sunk far stouter crafts.
I would not be a bit surprised to see the Cor
delia Heald show up again off the Heads some
time to-day.
SCAHE OVER THE BERKELEY.
raise Rumor That Ferryboat Had
Been Sunk.
- The ferryboats had an inning on the
water front yesterday. There was an at
tempted suicide on the Piedmont and a
rumor got around town that the Berke
ley had been sunk and 375 people
drowned. The foundation for the latter
story has been traced back to the Rio
disaster. At that time a spiritualist as
serted that she had located the wreck of
tlie unfortunate liner and at the same
time predicted that the ferry steamer
Eerkeley would go down on November 20
on the noon trip and that 375 people would
be drowned. Some one remembered the
story and ppoke about it aboard the ves
sel. It gradually spread and finally
reached the uptown offices in the nature
of a tale of real disaster. Between 1 and
2 p. m. the 'phones on the front were
kept busy answering queries and finally
the people there became so exasperated
that a purse of $100 was raised to pay
any one who would hunt up the originator
of the canard and bring him to the ferry
depot.
Just about the time the Berkeley was
supposed to have gone down the Piedmont
was on her way across the bay. A cry
of "Man overboard" caused the captain
to lower a boat and in a few minutes a
half crazy individual was picked up and
brought back aboard. At the Harbor
Hospital he gave his name aa J. L,
Thompson, but at the Central Emergency
Hospital he said his name was J. L-. Dro
han and said he was formerly a bar
keeper in the Hoffman. He had been on
a prolonged spree and sought to end his
life while suffering from delirium tremens.
Four Grain Vessels Depart
The Italian ship Francisco Ciampa, the
British bark Isabel Brown, the French
bark Due d'Aumale and the British ship
Iquique all got away for England yester
day. The latter vessel has only a small
cargo of grain, the bulk of her cargo being
conned fruits and salmon. All the ves
sels got a fair start, so they should have
an interesting race around the Horn.
Harbor Commissioners Meet.
The State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners held quite a lengthy session yes
terday, but all the business was routine.
The chief engineer wai directed to call for
bids for repairs to Fremont and Folsom
No. 2 wharves and also to confer with the
Southern Pacific officials in regard to a
new car ferry slip in Central Basin. The
railroad people are thinking of abandon
ing the present slip at the foot of Second
stTeet.
The chief engineer reported that the
proposed new spur track from the belt
railroad to the Gibraltar Warehouse
would cost $5650. The warehouse is in
charge of the St. Mary's Hospital trus
tees and if those gentlemen will guaran
tee the cost the spur track will be built.
"Water Front Notes.
Fears are felt for the barkentlne Che
haJls. now out ninety-three days from
Australia for this port. The chances are,
however, that she has been delayed by
heavy weather.
The barkentlne "Wrestler, from New
castle, Australia, for Honolulu, had to put
Into Sydney with her foretopgallant mast
gone. She was caught in a gale and se
verely buffeted by the elements.
H. P. Wilson, secretary of the Lewis
Spear ComDanly, goes East to-day on a
business trip.
The sunken river steamer Dauntless has
be*n partly raised and her owners expect
to have her on the drydock In a few days.
She was sunk in a collision with the Mary
Garratt in the San Joaquln River.
Another man was held up on the front
yesterday. The robber was caught, but
the victim disappeared and now the police
are looking for the man that was robbed
instead of the robber.
