"Evidently they felt perfectly secure,
though somewhat disappointed at missing
the cashier's vault, where there was $35,
000 in cash and a great quantity of
stamps. I cannot tell now how many, men
worked at the Job. Every effort will of
course be made to recover the property
and capture the men who took it."
"The space under the vault Is large
enough to allow a man to stand upright,
and their work must have been compara
tively easy with the drills and steel saws
which they used. The stamps were ar
ranged in twenty-pound bundles, and the
weight of the load they carried off must
have been Â£00 pounds. Evidently one man
handed the packages down to others wait
ing below. As their progress must have
been slow carrying even one bundle
through all those tunnels, crawling on all
fours, I judge they worked for hours get
ting their booty to the wagon.
"In this the robbers broke two holes,
possibly to secure more air, for the place
undoubtedly was very foul, or to have an
extra place of egress in case of discovery.
For light they used dry batteries, one of
which they left behind. This battery one
of my men discovered. It and the wagon
tracks are the only clews we have at pres
ent.
Burglars Make Air Holes.
â¢â¢It was the largest stamp robbery ever
done in the history of the postal service
in this country. To get to- the ,vault tha
men entered through a trap door. A few
feet In they encountered a brick wall,
\u25a0which they dug through rather than prowl
around looking for a clearer route. Tho
wall, like others under the building. Is of
flimsy construction and It could not have
taken them long to pick their way
through it. A hundred feet or so farther
on they ran against another wall and this
they also dug through.' On the way they
also encountered a number of pipes, and
as the floors are but two feet and in some
places three feet above the ground, they
tunneled under the pipes. Their whole
course Is plainly marked In this way. The
wholesale stamp vault, like the cashler'3
vault and the money order vault, Is sup
ported by a brick wall. It forms a square,
and before the robbery was airtight.
C. F. Spaulding, chief clerk of the
wholesale stamp department, discovered
the robbery when he opened the vault at
7:50 o'clock. ' The safe had been locked
with contents apparently secure at 5 p. m.
Saturday. Spaulding nctifled Postoffico
Inspector Stuart, who hurried from hl3
home and at once began an Investigation,
assisted by his deputies and a squad of
detectives from the City Hall. After com
pleting the search the Inspector said:
Of the $74,610 in stamps taken $4712 were
in "postage due" stamps and $2600 in spe
cial delivery stamps. So the convertible
stamps amounted to $57,828, but of these
$4828 were Pan-American stamps of 8 and
10 cent denominations.
Discovers the Bobbery.
Having secured their plunder the rob
bers loaded it into the wagon, drove
across a vacant lot and turned into "Wa
bash avenue' In front of the Art building.
The robbers drnye-up to. the - southeast
corner of the postofflce in a wagon,, the
tracks of which could be plainly seen
to-day. The building Is a temporary af
fair and the men had only to open a
little door to admit themselves under tha
flooring. Te reach the vault it was neces
sary to crawl about 300 feet over odds and
ends of boards which littered the way.
The route evidently had been carefully
studied, for a detective who went under
to-day without knowledge of locations be
came lost and was nearly overcome by the
foul odors before assistance reached him.
So carefully had the job been planned
that men working in other parts of the
building had not the slightest inkling of
the daring robbery being worked almost
under their noses.
Haid Is Carefully Planned.
The work of forcing an entrance to the
vault had evidently been going forward
with the greatest patience for many days.
It is believed, however, that the inten
tion of the thieves had been to enter
the cashier's vault. In which there was
$35,000 In money 'and stamps valued at
hundreds of thousands of dollars. The
bottom of the vault is of steel, half an
inch thick. In this ninety-seven holes
were bored until a space eighteen inches
squareâ just enough to allow the entrance
of a man's bodyâ had been so weakened
â¬hat it was possible to take out the whole
plate -without difficulty. A dry goods bos
stood over the hole thus made and con
cealed the. work of the robbers -while it
was In progress. When discovered to-day
the finger marks of one of the burglars
were still discernible on the dust of>the
box, which- he had pushed to one side.

thanks of the convention and was In

was necessary to visit the California De

did at once. There the date of the expira
tion of the O'Brien lease was discussed.
The committee was authorized to find
O'Brien and to offer him the $2500, and
the committeemen went out on that mis

of O'Brien's and the belief that' the option

put , the , delegates in favor of meeting
again at 1- o'clock and. of . appointing a
committee to try to raise the $2500 needed
to tie O'Brien's option up securely. There
was' some discussion concerning parlia
mentary procedure at this point, but the
convention adhered to^its plan 'of having
the necessary committee named at once
and President Voorheis appointed W.' C.

the members of the committee. ' ' .'\u25a0'\u25a0 :
The great importance of the Yuba River
works, for which the State-' has appro
priated $400,000 and the national Govern
ment $250,000,. with the prospect of an ad
ditional appropriation of $150,000, was so
apparent that when the convention met in
the afternoon the announcement that was
made by President Voorheis that the com
mittee had already ; secured the ; needed
coin during* the recess was answered by
applause, from all parts of the ' house.
Soon \u25a0 after that the committee's report
was received, which is 'as follows:
For Benefit of Miners.
To the President 'and Members of the ICali

committee begs leave to report that in the lim
ited time assigned it was Impossible ; to visit
many .merchants and citizens who would have
donated to this fund had they had the oppor

the adjacent lands.
Gentlemen of the California Miners' Associ
ation: Ten years ago a number of hydraulic
miners met in the city of Auburn, Placer
County, to see if some means could not bo
devised whereby hydraulic mining might be
resumed without material injury to the farm-

The outgrowth of that meeting was the organi

The speechmaking of the day brought
out many statements that were pleasing
to the miners. The address of principal
importance to the delegates was that
made by President Voorheis, which was
somewhat in the nature of a report and
contained recommendations for the good
of the association. He suggested the ap
pointment of a committee to revise the
by-laws of the association, so that every
member who contributes annual dues to
carry on the work shall be entitled to
take part in the association's annual con
ventions in thi3 city. ' -

distance from their ' lower barrier and I am
not prepared to give them the right to bank
tailings upon that land twenty feet high, as
Colonel Heuer claims he would do, thus raising
the plane of the river and endangering all the
land I own south of the seepage.
There would be no objection to a reasonable
amount. In short, I am as anxious those dams
should be built as I ever was and will put no

When the letter had been read the dele
gates to the convention were of the opin
ion that they would like to hear what
Mr. O'Brien would say to questions to be
asked to define his exact position. The
secretary told them that O'Brien was In
the hall. In response to a request by
President Voorheis O'Brien; went to the
stage and spoke.
He supplemented his letter that had
just "been read. He said that, when ho
agreed to give an option on the land he
understood that it was to â¢ be used for
a settling- basin, but when he was told
by Colonel Heuer that the tailings would
bank up twenty feet he was opposed. He
also said that he had never agreed to
convey the land, but had merely, offered
to give an easement to the United States.
Colonel Heuer told him that what the
Government wanted was an absolute deed.
He did not wish to be shutout two miles
from the river and he had withdrawn the
option for the reasons that he had stated.
Tha delegates listened attentively and
respectfully to O'Brien's statement of his
side of the case and then Pence asked:
- "Would you be willing to extend the
option three days?"
"No," answered O'Brien, decidedly, "not
as it stands, but I would if certain reser
vations were put In."

Secretary Benjamin also had a surprise
in store for the convention. He .had re
ceived a letter from O'Brien, and this he
read. It was dated at Smartsville, Octo
ber 9, 1901, and set foTth that O'Brien was
as anxious as he ever had been that the
dam should be built, but he also described
his grounds for raising aji objection to
the conditions that he thought were detri
mental to. him, as follows:
President Voorheis had successively in
troduced Governor Gage and Mayor Phe
lan and they had welcomed the miners
from the many counties of the State In
well turned phrases that were pleasing
and encouraging. The committee on cre
dentials had been named by the chair and
the proceeding's of the first day were run
ning along in a routine way. Just at this
point Lafe. Pence, who was sitting beside
ex-President W. C. Ralston at the left
of the Dresident in the body of the hall,
arose and made a statement that for the
time dwarfed the interest in all other top
ics before the convention.
Mr. Pence said that he had been Jn
communication with the members of the
California Debris Commission, consisting
of the United States â¢ engineers in San
Francisco, for two days. He had, Just
before the opening of. the convention,
read the contract or option that had been
signed by Mr. O'Brien, and he had dis
covered that the Instrument was dated
October 22, 1900, and that it provided that
a payment of $2500 must be made in one
yeax from the date mentioned. There
was in the contract the customary clause
that made time an essential part of the
consideration. Therefore the money must
be paid to O'Brien at once or the option,
that is of so much importance in the work
that will run up into hundreds of thou
sands of dollars of cost, would lapse.
This statement at once chained the at
tention of the convention. "The way to
attend to a thing," continued Pence, "ia
to act Quickly." â¢
The members acted with promptness
Justifying the emblems of vigor typified
by the picks, shovels and other adorn
ments of the hall. Pence suggested the
appointment of a committee to ' get the
money needed.
O'Brien Makes Statement.
THE ; convention of the California
Miners' Association, now in-ses
sion in this city, raised 52500 yes
terday through a committee to
pay James O'Brien, that # the op
tion he gave to the United States for
lands needed for a settling basin in con
nection with Yuba River dam might not
lapse. There was other business- before
the convention, but this was the matter
of emergency and it was promptly and
vigorously met. Indeed, before the con
vention had been properly organized, be
fore the committee on credentials had a
chance to report, O'Brien's case received
attention. O'Brien was in Golden Gate
Hall, where the deliberations of the con
vention were in progress. President Voor
hcis was in the chair, sitting under an
arch which was decorfcted in the center
with festooned American flags, at the
ends with crossed picks and shovels and
heroic figures of athletic young miners of
California.- The handsome banner of the
California Miners' Association was at his
right hand. . .
Lawyer Burke, when asked if his clients
vould be in danger of prosecution, said:
"I know of nothing which would indicate
t.iat the men would be prosecuted."
The bank for three days has been be
sieged by customers, but in every case
accounts were found to be correct. This
makes it impossible without an official
F^atement to ascertain wherein the men
v.ere short in their accounts. Smith was
under $30,009 bond," but Swift, as book
keeper, was not supposed to handle money
and -was not bonded.
Several of the directors have stated that
they do not expect Smith or Swift to re
turn here.
Interest for the moment centers in the
pursuit of Smith and Swift and- to-night
it was understood that United Stales ofli
eers had found near this city the men's
hiding place. An immediate arrest wa3
expected, without regard to the probable
inaction of the bank directors. It is gen
erally believed the men were in Boston
until this morning and that they are now
some distance away. Smith had corre
eponded with Montreal persons and it is
thought he has cone there.
The loot from the bank vaults was re
turned in carpet bags delivered at the
bai.k very early this morning:, after the
bank directors had been in conference at
a hotel with lawyers John C. Burke of
this city and Charles YÂ»\ Barilett of Bos
ton, representing: the men. What the ar
rangement was by which the bank got the
greater part of the plunder will not be
stated, but the happiness of all the bank's
officers, displayed without reserve, indi
cates the seriousness of the situation be
fDre the agreement.
Ho Disposition to Prosecute.
LOWELL, Mass.. Oct. 2Lâ The financial
troubles -which have caused great sus
pense to the officers of the Merchants'
National Bank for three days, in conse
quence of the disappearance of its teller,
Albert G. Smith, and its bookkeeper,
Lewis H. Swift, practically were smoothed
out to-day. The bank has lost about
J115.000. The directors officially state this,
and at the same time say they have had
returned "valuable securities."
The bank's less, it Is understood, is
made up of two items: First, the steal
ings of the two men during the past two
years, as shown now by the books, and
secondly, that part of the cash included
in the loot retained by Smith and Swift
:as the price of their bargain to return
thÂ© securities.
The valuable securities which have been
recovered represented bonds, notes and
other negotiable papers and bunches of
money, all supposed to have been taken
from the bank vault just prior to the tinie
â¢the men disappeared on Thursday night.
The securities returned amount to $S00,O00.

"Mr. Watterson has reason to be proud
of the response made by the press of the

in spirit and purpose which proclaimed
him a candidate consecutively for Gov

authorization he should not be held tq

from such a source. Every man has a
right- to be his own mouthpiece and inter

POLITICAL PRISONER
RELEASED FROM. JAXL
Lieutenant Thomas F. Carter, while cor
recting his previous testimony, stated that
he desired to change that portion of his
answer to a auestion by the court, in
which he had said that the two after boil
ers of the Brooklyn had no water in them
when the battle began on the morning of
July 3. As corrected he desired the an
swer to read: "The two after boilers had
little or no water in them. Their fires
were not laid until after the battle calls
were sounded."
Ensign W. P. Cronan while on the stand
for the purpose of correcting his testi
mony stated that he had measured the dis
tance from the initial position of tha
Brooklyn to Rio Tanquino on July 3, and
found it to be twenty-three knots.
J. L. Hunley, the chief machinist on
the Texas, who last week testified that on
July 3 he was at the throttle of the port
engine of the Texas, while correcting, his
testimony was asked by Judge Advocate
Lemly as to what other machinist was
stationed in the port engine-room On the
day of the ba-.tle. ; The witness replied
that as soon as general quarters sounded
he relieved Machinist Hill. He stated in
reply to questions by Captain Lemly that
Claxton, who had testified- that he was
at the port engine on that day and that
the engine was reversed, was stationed
at the air pumps, back, of the engine.
Hunley said he kept his hand on the
Boilers of the Brooklyn.
In reply to a question from Raynor, the
witness said it took from the forenoon
watch of the 27th until the evening of the
28th, "working day and night," to make
the repairs on the Merrimac. He did not
know how long the vessel had been to
tally disabled. Captain Hannum desired
to make a statement concerning the testi
mony of another witness to the effect that
there was no water in two of the boilers
of the Brooklyn. As this statement did
not concern his own testimony, the court
ruled it out of order. â¢"
"She was in condition to make five knots
when I went on board. I did not give her
seven knots."
her boilers at all times while in the San
tiago blockade."
Captain Cook, was then excused and
former â¢witnesses were called to correct
their testimony. While Captain John L.
Hannum was on stand for the purpose of
correcting his testimony, the court asked
him the following question: . .
"How soon affer you went on board the
Merrimac wp.3 she able to use her own
power to make from five to seven knots?"
Lieutenant Wells, who was on the stand
when the court' adjourned Friday, was
then recalled and testified regarding the
battle of July 3. He said he did not re
member the ranges at which the Brook
lyn fired, but thought 1100 yards was the
shortest. He described the turn of the
Brooklyn and the chase after the Spanish
ships. When the Viscaya ran ashore the
Colon was about 10,000 yards ahead of the
Brooklyn, and for a time firing ceased.
He said that he had received orders to
get a quantity of rapid fire ammunition.
Owing to the character of the coast it
was expected that the Brooklyn and the
Colon would come to close quarters. He
was ordered to have this ammunition
ready to close with the Colon and give
her a rapid fire when they got close to
gether. He then described the chase and
the surrender of the Colon. He said he
had not seen the Texas when the Brook
lyn made her turn. At one time during
the battle, he said, the Brooklyn seemed
.to be. alone engaging three ships.
Whfcn Lieutenant Wells finished his de
scription of the battle the question of dis
patches was taken up.
A number of dispatches were shown to
the witness and he was asked as to their
receipt by Commodore Schley. One from
Secretary Long to the American Consul
at Kingston, .dated Washington, May 28,
saying that it must be delivered to Schley
at once and informing him (Schley) that
unless unsafe for his squadron the de
partment-wished him to remain off San
tiago, and asking if he could not take
possession of Guantanamo as a coaling
station; also a dispatch from Secretary
Long to Captain Cotton of the* Harvard,
dated Washington, May 29, inclosing dis
patches to Commodore Schley, telling him
to. hold on at all hazard, that the New
York, Oregon and New Orleans were on
the way; also two dispatches from Secre
tary. Long to the dispatch boat Harvard,
throttle of the' engine most of the time,
anrj did not think it possible that the
signal to stop or back could have been
given without his knowledge. ; Â«
Captain Lemly asked the witness if he
had been on the Texas when that vessel
ran aground at Newport. Raynor object
ed to this line of examination. Captain
Lemly stated that he desired to show
that the witness had misunderstood sig
nals then with disastrous results, and it
was possible he might have been mistaken
on the day of the battle. After a short
argument the court decided that the ques
tion was not admissible. v^

"Am I right in saying that you perhaps
saw more or as much of Commodore
Schley during the whole of this Spanish
war as any one else and came in contact
with him as much as anybody?"
"I saw him daily and all through each
day, generally speaking."
"Did you see him during the time of the
reconnoissance on May 31?" â¢-
"Yes, sir."
"Did you see him frequently during the
day of the battle of July 3?" :
"No, sir. I only saw him during the

"Did you see him. during any of the

"I saw him during one of them, exactly
which one I cannot distinctly recollect."

PARIS, Oct. 21.â The fact that France
has not yet employed coercive measures
to enforce a settlement of the Lorando
claim by Turkey is due to the unsettled
condition of the interior of the country.
It is feared that such action might bring
about the disruption of Turkey. The mis
government â¢ of Macedonia, the excesses
committed in Armenia and the dissatis
faction in the island of Crete have reach
ed such a point a^ to constitute a menace
to peace. \
The powers, acting on the initiative of
Russia and France, are now discussing
the basis of an understanding for joint
representation to the Porte and for event
ually obliging the Sultan not only to
carry out the treaty of Berlin relating to
Macedonia and Armenia, but to give
guarantees for further reforms and the
settlement of numerous pending ques

In the allocution Commander Richard

three has become reduced to twenty
three. Since the establishment of the
council there have been enrolled in all
112 active members, of whom eighty-four
have died and five are on tTie
emeritus list. In the past two years
forty new bodies of the Scottish Rite
have been organized; the number
of perfect elus has increased by 3385, and
princes of the Royal Secret have in
creased by S163. Assurances have been
received that the Supreme Council at
Colon, at a session this month, will with
draw authority over the subordinate
bodies in Porto Rico, and Mr. Richard
son announced that the jurisdiction of
this Supreme Council over Porto Rico is
undisputed. He urged their co-operation
with the Porto Riean bodies. He con
gratulated the order on the ususual
freedom of Masonry from charlatanism
and the spurious, and urged continued
careful scrutiny of all applicants.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 21.â The Supreme
Council, thirty-third degree, of the An
cient and Accepted Scottish Rite of
Freemasonry for the Southern Jurisdrc
tlon of the United States, the mother
council of the world, met to-day in bi
ennial session. The gathering marks the
centennial celebration of the council,
which was established in Charleston,
S. C, in May. 1801. the actual recogni
tion of the centenary being deferred un
til now to be coexistent with the unveil
ing of the monument to the late General
Albert Pike, long sovereign grand com
mander. The feature of to-day's session
was the allocution delivered by Represen
tative Richardson of Tennessee, the lieu
tenant grand commander and acting sov
ereign grand commander. The allocu
tion, among other things, laid down an
important ruling that a member of a
foreign jurisdiction cannot become a
member of this jurisdiction without sev
ering his connection with the former.
"'If an applicant is a member of bodies
in a foreign jurisdiction," according to
the allocution, "he cannot be admitted
into a body in ours until he renounces
his allegiance to such foreign jurisdic
tion. A citizen of Great Britain or o'ther
foreign Government may be a citizen of
the United States, but he must first re
nounce foreign allegiance and* swear al
legiance to our own Government. A
similar rule should apply to Masonry."
The hc-ir to the throne is Pu Oliur*. son
of Prince Tuan. He was born in 1SS4. In
1SS5 Prince Tuan, who had been one of the
most powerful of the ativssers of the Dow
ager Empress, obtained the honor of hav
ing his son named by the Emperor and a
short time afterward Pu Chun was se
lected as the heir to the widow of one of
the wealthiest Manchu Princes. In the
autumn of 1S&S, when the Emperor, was
deprived of all but nominal power, it was
announced- that Pu Chun had" been se
lected as heir apparent to the. throne.
It was announced in November last that
Prince Tuan had fled to Kansu. He is a
Manchu of pure descent, is the grandson
of the Emperor Taouk Wang, who died
in 1S50, and a nephew of the Emperor
Hean Fung, who died in 1861. Prince
Tuan's father. Prince Tung, was the most
likely heir to the throne after Taouk
Wang's death, but his succession was set
aside for some reason which was not
made public .
About the middle of th!s year Prince
Tuan was^aid to be fomenting an insur
rection in Western Mongolia. He was last
reported to be at Ulumski, in Turkestan,
to which part of the world. he had been
banished as a result of the part which he
took in the Boxer uprising.
Prince Chine: will start about November
1 from here to act as grand marshal of
the court on its journey from Kaifing.
PEKING, Oct. 2Lâ A new heir to the
throne will be appointed when the Dow-'
ager Empress meets Prince Chins and
several of the Viceroys at Kaifing, capi
tal of the province of Honan, where
there will be a general discussion of the
affairs of the empire. This news is be
lieved to be authentic, as It was received
from Chinese officials. The present heir
has proved to be dissipatecLand uncon
trollable. Moreover, his father's status as
a banished Prince makes his succession
contrary to Chinese, tradition?. The can
didate of the Empress is said to be Peitze,
a nephew of Prince Tuan and who is .in
tellectually weak. He participated in the
Boxer aggressions, personally leading an
attack, on the French cathedral. The r_* T
form i.action disapproves of the selection
and suggests that the powers will oppose
it if the Empress wishes to carry it out.
Lovelace and Reynolds were both unin
jured. They immediately gave themselves

tinued his narrative of" the Cuban cam

examination for about two and a half
hours, largely at the hands of Hanna,
whose questions were directed mainly to
the dispatches sent and received by Ad

While this line of examination was being
exploited, Raynor, speaking for Admiral
Schley, said that the admiral was willing
to admit that he had received the "Dear
Schley letter" on the Dupont, which ar
rived at Cienfuegos on. May 22, but he
"added that no duplicate of- this dispatch
had ever, been received by Admiral Schley.
He said also that the admiral admitted
the. receipt of two copies of No. 8,-Admi
ral Sampson's dispatch, saying that the
Spanish fleet was probably at Santiago,
and telling Commodore Schley, "If satis
fied that it (the Spanish fleet) is. not at
Cienfuegos proceed with all ; dispatch to

the Hawk, May 23, and the other by. the

WASHINGTON, Oct. a.â The distin

was the guest of President Roosevelt at
luncheon to-day. The Marquis* called at
the White House earlier in the day to pay
his respects to the President. He was
escorted by the resident Japanese Minis
ter, Mr. Takahira. and by Mr. Tsudsuki.
formerly Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
of Japan, but at present acting as one of
the secretaries to the Marquis. The Pres
ident gave his visitors a cordial welcome.
The Marquis speaks English with facility,
as does Tsudsuki. The President was
much interested in their conversation.
Having been Prime Minister of Japan sev
eral times, and especially during the war
with China, and having taken a leading
part in the establishment of constitution
al government in Japan, the Marquis Ito
is particularly well informed on topics in
which the Presiuent is Interested. Tsud
suki, who Is also a member of the House
of Peers of Japan and a man of strong
character, is giving special attention to
financial. Industrial and commercial con
ditions in the United States and has ob
served many things of Interest in the
short time he has been in this country, so
he was also able to add his share in the
conversation with the President.
It was the desire of President Roose
velt to give a dinner in honor of the visit
ing Japanese and, indeed, he pressed the
Marquis to accept an Invitation to the
dinner on the 26th inst., which is the
earliest data that a formal dinner would
be in order at the White House. The
Marquis was obliged to decline this invi
tation, as it would conflict with his en
gagement to attend the Yale bicentennial.
With the President and Marquis Ito at
luncheon were Secretary of State Hay
and Mr. Tsudsuki.

That ended the day's proceedings. The
case will go on again to-day at 10:30 a. m.
I vtt -^Â»r -p T. HUME, who has been
/\ / tne 8tar w l tness *Â°r two
\v\v days and a nalf in tne
v v O Nome contempt cases,
made his exit during the
afternoon session and ex-Marshal C. L.
Vawter took his place on the stand. Hume
told many strange tales of corruption,
fraud and dishonesty, but his testimony
doesn't begin to reach the importance of
that of Cawter, so far as the contempt
proceedings are concerned.
Until the ex-marshal was put upon the
stand the attorneys for the respondents
shouted nothing but "Hearsay evidence"
to all that Hume said \n the course of his
testimony. When Attorneys McLaughlin
and Heney heard the marshal's story
their brows knitted and the look of
â¢ trouble came into their eyes. His evidence
is direct to the point. The cross-examina
tion, which has been launched but not
yet finished, has so far done nothing in
the way of confusing the witness. What
may come of it to-day is a matter of con
jecture. Vawter is positive enough in his
recitalâ not quite so sure of manner and
speech as Hume, but sufficiently danger
ous to worry the minds of the re
spondents.
Vawter was the marshal who served
the writs upon Noyes, Frost and Mc-
Kenzie and the rest of the combination.
His testimony, if uncontradicted, will
reach the root of the evil. Certain con
versations which he overheard proved
sensations in themselves. Judge Ross, ac
cording to the marshal's testimony, was
the target of a very uncomplimentary
speech on the part of Noyes, and the
whole Circuit Court Is put upon the grill.
And Senator Carter of Montana makes his*
appearance again, this time as a poli
tician with a hand on Alaskan affairs. In
fact, the whole of Vawter's testimony Is
as sensational In its way' as that of Hume,
who was the star during the introductory
proceedings.
Attorneys Cross Wits.
Whether it was the hot weather or the
growing impatience of the respondents'
attorneys that caused the tili3 at argu
ment is a question to solve, but one thing
is certain: the attorneys who are con
ducting the examination are no longer
passing compliments. Attorneys Pills
bury, McLaughlin and Heney had many
a wordy war yesterday. McLaughlin ami
Heney fell back upon the lawyer's re
courseâthe objection â morning and after
noon. It was all in vain, however, for
in this examination before Judge Heacock
objections may be stated and entered upon
the record, but the witness answers the
questions just the same.
During the morning session a recess was
taken to allow Mr. Piilsbury, amicus
curiae, to Inform the Circuit Court of
Appeals that the testimony would not be
finished for several days. The court post
poned the hearing until Wednesday.
Joseph K. Wood appeared before the
court and pleaded guilty, but said he had
extenuating circumstances to offer, and
the court will hear him this morning.
Back to Old Ground:
"Did not Judge Noyes change his opin
ions in certain cases after other attorneys
had been appointed' in the place of
Hume?" began Mr. Piilsbury, amicus
curiae, at the opening of the morning
session.
Then the first disagreement between the
attorneys occurred, and Commissioner
Heacock was called upon to settle the
difficulty.
"I am. interrogating: this witness as to
specific acts of Judge Noyes," said Pills
bury. A deluge of words followed and
the examination proceeded.
Concerning the affidavits In the Yager
case the witness was asked about the
changes in Judge Noyes' opinion after the
appointment of R. M. Stevens as a suc
cessor to Hume. The case was easily set
tled, according to the witness* testimony,
within two hours.
"What Intimation was there either by
Judge Noyes or McKenzie as to the obe
dience of these writs?" continued Pllls-

Then McLaughlin tried another tack, h
"Mr. Hume, I'll now ask you your age,
he said.
Hume answered that he was 42 years
old, and in response to other questions,
said he practiced in all the courts in Cal
ifornia, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.
He was an Assemblyman, a deputy dis
trict attorney, a full-fledged district at
torney and holder of other important
offices. McLaughlin seemed satisfied.
"At the time you commenced the action
of Chips vs. LIndeberg, had you a re
tainer from Lindeberg?" asked McLaugh
'lin.
"Prior to that time I had a retainer
from the Pioneer Mining. Company, in
which LIndeberg was largely interested."
"Had not Lindeberg, some time before
the litigation, given you a, retainer of
$300?"
Piilsbury called for the receipt, but Mc-
Laughlin demanded the answer without
the production of the paper. Then the
amicus curiae advised the witness not to
answer it.
Heney interjected:
"Mr. Piilsbury is acting, no doubt, as a
pure amicus curiae."
"As nothing else," said Piilsbury. .'
Then the witness explained.
"I was relieved from my obligation in
1899, in the fall of the year, when the re
tainer came to an end."
"In what way did they relieve you?"
was the next auestion.
"They said consider yourself discharge'd.
They thought my relations to some of my
clients might interfere with their business,
so they withdrew their business. There
was no ill feeling, between us."
End of the Chief Witness.
At the close of the morning session the
attorney for the respondents passed the
witness to Mr. ' Piilsbury the third time.
Then followed the oft-repeated examina
tion of the cases in which the witness was
concerned and from which he had with
drawn and concerning which Judge Noyes
changed his rulings as soon as different
attorneys appeared. Again the witness
went back to Judge McLaughlin.
"Was It arranged In the Ring vs. Yager
case that Mr. Stevens, Court Commis
sioner, appointed by Judge Noyes, should
pay $5000 for an interest in the
said McLauehlln.
"I think It was," answered the witness.
Joseph K. Wood, the District Attorney
\u25a0 and also among those cited for contempt,
had a few questions to ask. His first
was: . â¢
"In fact, Mr. Hume, we are bitter ene
mies, are we not?" Hume didn't know
about the adjective, but admitted the
noun.
"Isn't it a fact that but for the time I
was at St. Michael I attended largely to
the criminal matters?"
"We both attended to them."
"Are we on speaking terms?" â¢
"I don't speak to you and I don't know
whether or not you care to speak to me."
The respondents' attorneys desired the
attendance of the witness at some future
day. Ae his testimony is to be signed to
day he will bo present this morning before
discharge.
Vawter in Star Role.
Hume gave way to former Marshal C.
L, Vawter, who was the relief of a dull
ses&Ion. In answer to the first shot di
rected at him by Piilsbury he said:
I first' saw Judge Noyes , in Alaska at St.
Michael, on my way to Nome In July, 1900.
Next before that I saw him In Seattle in June.
What service did you make of the writs?
I took the writs on September 14â the Chips
writ to Judge Noyes. He was just getting up
I walked In and handed him the writ. While
he was reading it I left him. . L*ter in the, day
I saw him about 4 o'clock and told him I 'was
there to support the court. He said he wasn't
going to do anything and McKenzie could do as
he pleased. Later In the month he told me I
had no business - to serve I the writ; On Sep
tember 15 I received a letter from him. I have
the letter.
The letter was then produced and read.
It reads as follows: -.
The Blake-Hadfclein case was threshed
over again. -This was the litigation over
a grub stake, and Hume was at first the
attorney of record, but later was succeed
ed by Attorney H. A.'Bruner. A demur
rer to the complaint was overruled in
Hume's time, but a demurrer to an
amended complaint, in which Bruner fig-
Hume and Noyes had a tilt In court
over litigation, and the following testi
mony of the witness is to the point:
In the courtroom. In the presence of many
people, Judge Noyes on the bench unnecessarily
rebuked me In a manner that brought the at
tention of all to me. I was informed that the
case in question could not be tried unless we
agreed to the receivership. I desired to have
these cases tried at once and asked the court
for It orally. He told me I ought to have
better sense than to ask for it orally, that I
should file my claim and have It put on the
docket. That was the rebuke and what I told
McKenzie when I met him. later. This was
after court opened, about the end of Sep
tember, 1900.
The cross-Questions about the stock
brought out a reply from the witness that
he believed there was such stock of the
Alaska Gold Mining and Exploration Com
pany.
McLaughlin's first question was:
"In that case in which you were attor
ney for the intervenor did you think it
was a proper case for the appointment of
a receiver?"
"Yes," answered Hume.
"Who was appointed?"
"Denny Brogan."
"How about the other cases?"
The responses of the witness were the
same.
"To whom are you arguing this matter,
Mr. Piilsbury?" said Heney, looking at
the reporters. The former smiled serenely,
and forced the question.
Tho witness replied that McKenzie
would have done Just such a thing. In
fact, he thought he did it on more than
one occasion. There the re-examination
ended.
McLaughlin fairly sizzled over this ques
tion, and provoked the following from
Piilsbury:
I am proposing to show that McKenzie
obtained an Interest and for that reason
promised an order x>t the court.
In the case of the Leo and Libre Mining
Company 'vs. Alaska Gold and Exploration
Company, Swanson and Jensen, lntervenors
and my clients, were anxious to haxe a receiver
appointed, and as soon as McKenzie obtained
an interest he saw to the appointment of a
receiver. I was told that if I named the re
ceiver he would be appointed.
-"Did McKenzie get the interest prom
ised?"
I don't remember of any distinct date or
conversation where Judge Noyes â¢ had informed
me that McKenzie was the Intermediary. I
had interviews by direction of McKenzie. He
informed me that he had seen Judge Noyes
and the latter wanted to see me. These oc
cured frequently In relation to Anvil Creek
litigation on which McKenzie was appointed
receiver.
"Was the stock of the Alaska Gold Min
ing Company promised you \u25a0* ever given
you?"
"I have never received or seen any evi
dences of the stock."
"There was something said about the
receivership of Mrs. Requa vs. Linder
berg. and Jacobs vs. Brensen cases being
heid up until McKenzie was satisfied, was
there not?" asked Piilsbury, following the
same line. The witness answered:
Interests for McKenzie.
bury. Then came the McLaughlin objec
tion again- and further argument.
"It is difficult to remember the exact
words further than I have stated them,"
said Hume. "The trend of the conversa
tion was based on statements to which I
have testified. The writ was considered
void and the conversation showed a dis
position to avoid the writ." ,
"On any other occasion do you know
McKenzie to have been intermediary of
Judge i>oyes?" asked Piilsbury.
McLaughlin interposed with an objec
tion that Hume be forced to state noth
ing but facts and not be allowed to black
en the character of men in this ruthless
fashion. The question \u25a0was answered in
this fashion:
I have been able for. the first ' time to make
an examination of the original order sent down
from the Circuit Court of Appeals and find that
it will be necessary for me to enter certain
orders of record here, which will be done as
Boon as they can be drawn and spread upon
the records. In the meantime it devolves upon
you to preserve the peace and good order, so
far as it is possible for you to do, and I have
taken occasion to request Major Van Orsdale
to render such assistance as necessary . to
protect life and property and hold things in
statu quo until the order can be prepared and
presented to the court. Sincerely yours -
ARTHUR H. NOTES, Judge.
Continuing, the witness said:
When I received the letter I went up to see
Judge Noyes. I told him that I had put two sol
diers to guard the bullion. He said, "Keep the
guard on; don't let anybody get It." There was
a rumor at that time that the Lane people
would get It.
"By what right were they claimingto
get it?" said Piilsbury. -
"By the writ of supersedeasâ and they
talked of executing it themselves. I told
this later to Judge Noyes, and he said it
was right not to let them get the bullion."
"Did you have a conversation with Mc-
Kenzie in regard to complying with this
writ?"
Judge Noyes Condemns.
Vawter said he received some advice
from C. S. A. Frost, the court examiner,
in regard to the posse comltatus which
the marshal, wanted to guard the gold
dust. He produced a letter to show the
extent and character of the advice.
"How did Mr. Frost come to take an
interest in it?" continued Piilsbury in his
examination.
"As a representative of the court he
gave me advice at all times."
"Do you know what his relations were
with McKenzte?"
"Very friendly. I afterward learned Mc-
Kenzie paid him money. He was very
friendly to Judge Noyes. He Is now pri
vate secretary to Judge Noyes."
"Did you afterward have any talk with
Judge Noyes?"
"About a week later,"
"Did you have any talk about disobe
dience of writs?"
"I did. .1 said to Judge Noyes, "There is
no danger but that you will obey writs
of the appellate'court.' " 'Now, don't you
think it," said Noyes."
The witness then related some conver
sation between Noyes and other parties
conversations which he overheard. Here
is a bit on Judge Ross:
I overheard In January. 1901, Judge Noyes eay
that Judge Roes was a sandlotter and put In
office by. the disreputable element of California,
and he proposed to see whether Judge Ross
would question him.
The witness also overheard Noyes say
in a conversation with Dr. Sheldon Jack
son: /
I tell you, doctor, we have got to have the
territorial form of government. Congress Is
no more fit to legislate for us than the Circuit
Court to adjudicate. Just wait till McKenzie
gets down there; he'll make the fur fly and
show the Appellate Court what's what.
Senator Carter Again..
After this came the talk of Gaylen and
Senator' Carter, who was mentioned last
week. The witness said:
"Gaylen told me he was up there to look
out for Senator Carter's interests."
Here came an objection. McLaughlin
wanted to know the materiality of it, but
Piilsbury insisted, so the witness contin
ued: ..
I met McKenzie In May In Washington, and
just as I was leaving Carter said. "You owe
your appointment exclusively to me, and Mc-
Kenzie Is going up to that country and I want
you to treat him just as you would treat me."
"Did you eve'r hear. Judge Noyes say he
was going to maintain McKenzie as re
ceiver?" was Pillsbury's next question.
"I heard him say - he was going to
shoulder the responsibility and keep Mc-
Kenzie receiver."
Vawter was then taken In hand and
subjected to cross-examination by Mc-
Laughlin.
"You say Frost not only said damn the
military, but * fight anybody to get that
dust and hold itâ even the whole army
and the navy?"_ . *
"I thought he was unduly alarmed over
the warlike character of the Lane peo
ple," was' the response.
"Are you friendly with Judge Noyes?"

unfriendliness.*'

Miss Wallace refuses any explanation,
but the truth of her confession is un
doubted.
Mrs. Baker says that this specification
contained the rirst inkling of rhe reason
iying; behind her husband's conduct to
her. She at once appealed to the letter
carrier, who confessed her sex, and a re
union of the estranged couple followed.
The revelation of Miss Wallace's sex has
caused a commotion in the county where
ehe has been known as "Willie," and was
looked upon as a somewhat dissipated
young man.
Tne woman came to Harrisburg five
years ago in company with Henry Keep
and his wife, her supposed uncle and aunt.
Keep was later appointed Postmaster of
an outlying hamlet and "Willie" secured
the position of carrying the mail to the
county seat twice each week. The sup
posed youth boasted of conquests amongr
women along- the route and no suspicion
of her sex was entertained.

still in a precarious condition, but if is
believed he will survive. Detective Ed

result of a personal quarrel rather than
a deed of a highbinder struggle.
Toy, the injured Chinese, disclaims all
knowledge of who committed the assault
or the causes leading up to it. The po

only recognized the highbinder, but knows
why the hatchet- was used.

The Democrats of the Fortieth Assem
bly District held a rousing mass meeting
in Franklin Hall, at Bush and Fillmore
streets, last night. Addresses were made
by Joseph S. Tobin, Franklin K. Lane and
other candidates and the greatest enthu
siasm was displayed.
Chairman George Connolly called the
meeting to order in a brief speech, in
which he alluded to the sterling qualities
of the various Democratic candidates. The
name of Tobin was greeted with tremen
dous applause and the appearance of the
various candidates was the signal for vo
ciferous outbursts. The Republican nom
inees were \u25a0 discussed and the prediction
made "that they will all be politically
dead after. November 5."
Supervisor John Connor was the first
speaker. He spoke In behalf of the nom
inees for Supervisor, all of whom, he said,
had reputations before they went into of
fice and had not lost them by reason of
their official acts. Their sole desire was
to give the city a businesslike administra
tion. The first thing they did. was to wipe
out a big deficit and the second to pay a
debt- of $300,000 to the merchants and
school teachers. There never was a ring
in the board and if the. voters decided to
return the members for the next term a
more brilliant record in the line of im
provements would, in the opinion of the
speaker, be assured.
Patrick Boland, nominee for Public Ad
ministrator, made a plea for re-election.
He spoke of the discharge of the functions
of his office I and nattered himself that
none could have done better. Mr. Boland
was greeted with great applause.
District Attorney Lewis F. . Byington
spoke in praise of the present Board of
Supervisors, which, he said, had liquid
ated the accumulated debts of twenty
years and given the city the lowest tax
rate in ten years.. As for himself and the
discharge of his official duties, he said,
his record spoke for itself and that was
good enough, he thought, to insure his re
election.

DENVER, Oct. 21.â Eddie Toy of San
Francisco was given the decision to-night
over "Spike" Wallace of Pittsburg at the
end of a ten-round 'go before the Elyria
Athletic Club. Elyria is a suburb of Den
ver. The men fought for a side bet of
$250 and 65 per cent of the gate receipts.
Toy had the best of it all the way
through, Wallace staying the limit by
hanging on continuously.
The same men were prevented from
fighting in Denver by the police a week
ago. ...

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21.â Fierce war Is
on between Chief Justice W. H. Beatty
of the Supreme Court and Associate Jus
tice C. H. Garoutte, 'and, barring their
official duty, the two. distinguished gentle
men are in the habit of ignoring one an
other's existence. Members of the bar In
Los Angeles have been aware that the
relations between Justices Beatty and .
Garojitt'e are ; strained,' but the fact that
they hold no personal intercourse with
one another has come to the surface only
since the Supreme Court in bank began
its regular winter session one week ago.
Chief Beatty and Justice Garoutte are
both candidates for re-election, with the
distinction that while the latter could un
doubtedly obtain a renomination h& has
openly insisted that unless the ChiewJus
ticeship comes to him he will decline his
present position. Justice Beatty will not,
of course, consent to stand for any place
except that wherein he is now incumbent.
But for this attitude neither Chief Jus
tice Beatty nor Justice Garoutte would
have the slightest trouble in obtaining a
renomination. Their bitterness may
result in neither continuing on the Su
preme bench after next year. /
Governor Henry T. Gage is expected to
reach Los Angeles to-morrow morning,
and John C. Lynch, accompanied by Jero
Burke, arrived this afternoon. The latter
two gentlemen are the principal lieuten
ants of Colonel Daniel M. Burns, and their
visit south at this time Is takpn to mean
that plans for the Republican State cam
paign next year are being formed in
earnest.
Justice Garoutte does not hesitate to
announce that he is after the official scalp
of the Chief Justice, and he insists that
under no circumstances will he consent to
serve another term as the court is con
stituted. Justices Beatty and Garoutte
were friends until two years ago. The
Supreme Court was then considering a
case of some importance wherein a new
trial was not granted. A rehearing was
demanded and was denied, Justice Gar
outte writing the opinion ' In the issue.
Chief Justice Beatty took exceptions to
the law as laid down by his colleague and
wrote a dissenting opinion. The war then
commenced and it has been growing in
fierceness since that time.
Speaker C. W. Pendleton of the Assem
bly feels aggrieved because Samuel M.
Shortridge of San Francisco, who aspires
to succeed United States Senator George
C. Perkins, is overlooking him. Mr. Short
ridge had been in the habit of confiding
in Cornelius Pendleton until the latter
looked upon himself as the Southern Cal
ifornia manager of the Shortridge boom.
Then Mr. Pendleton joined the barbers'
union as honorary member and had other
honor3 thrust upori him, all of which re
sulted in criticism for the late Speaker of
the California Assembly. Mr. Shortr,idge
has beeen in Los Angeles for several days
and up to to-day he had failed . to call
upon his erstwhile Southern California
manager.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The details for the execution have been
practically completed, and while the
prison authorities guard with great se
crecy all facts, it is thought the execution
will take place before 6 o'clock in the
morning of October 28, or, if everything
cannot be made ready on that day, at a
similar hour on the 29th. The work of se
lecting the jury to sign the death war
rant of the murderer has been completed
but their names are withheld from publi
cation. They will not be known until the
morning of the execution.
Superintendent of State Prisons Collins
is silent as to whom he will invite but it
is learned that the Sheriff of Erie County
within whose jurisdiction the crime was
committed, .will receive an invitation Be
cause of the small attendance that can be
had under the statute there will be but a
limited number of representatives of the
press present.
ALBANY, N. Y., Oct. 21.â Warden
Meade of Auburn Prison spent several
hours to-day in conference with Superin

the sentence of death imposed on Leon F.
Czolgozs, the murderer of President Me-
Kinley. They went carefully over the 1200
requests which have been received for in
vitations to the electrocution. There will
be but twenty-six wltnsses admitted, the
law limiting the number. The prison phy
sician will be assisted in the conduct of
the autopsy by Dr. Carlos F. MacDonald
former president of the State Commission

cussed" the issues of the campaign in a
vigorous manner. He said that the Re
publican voters of San Francisco were
disappointed with thei rticket, the result
being a lack of enthusiasm and interest
in the outcome. Everywhere the candi
dacy of the Republican nominees was los
ing ground, while on the other hand, the
Democratic ticket was gaining strength.
He paid a tribute to Joseph S. Tobin, who
arrived during his address, and expressed
the conviction that he would sweep the
city.
Attempts were made to rfave candidates
speak, but the crowd yelled for Tobin,
and when he advanced a tremendous up
roar resulted. It was several minutes be
fore order was restored. Mr. Tobin said
in aart:
The administration of public affairs is a
business and not politics. Everything that
affects the welfare of a city is of vital inter
est to every good, honest citizen. Our schools,
parks and sanitation are the arteries of munici
pal life, and their preservation is the aim and
duty of all worthy citizens.
There are no issues in this campaign. It is
merely a fight between good and bad citizen
ship. You are the doctor. Elect honest men
and you will have a good government; elect
bad. subservient men and you will have a bad
government. In which camp shall ve find the
honest men? In which camp shall we find the
men who have been pledged to corporations at
the price of their nominations? How ha3 the
Republican Convention done its work? Every
body knows that the convention, masquerading
as Republicans, was composed of nothing save
puppets manipulated by party bosses. The Re
publican newspapers know it, and the Repub
licans as a body know it. They know the con
vention was dominated by big corporations, and
its creatures must serve them if elected. They
cannot serve the public under these circum
stances without proving recreant to the trust
reposed in them by their corporation masters.
In his speech at Metropolitan Hall Mr. Wells,
my opfjonent, said it was necessary that the
Mayor and Supervisors should be of the same
political faith. Where is the man who witl
vote for the Republican nominees for Super
visors?- Xot a single newspaper in San Fran
cisco supports that part of the ticket. Un
fortunately Mr. Wells" speech was so short it
gives me no ammupltion with which to fire
back. I say there is no honeat citizen who
looks with the light of his Intelligence upon
the Republican Convention as it was domi
nated and controlled who will vote the ticket
named by it. I am no politician and I did not
seek the nomination for Mayor for the salary
there is in It. but I felt that I had a right to
serve the city in which I was born. I stan^l
here unpledged and if I am elected it will
be because the- honest voters deem the Demo
cratic nominees to be better than their oppo
nents on the other side.
The interests which contributed to the
selection of Mr. Wells for Mayor have be
come alarmed at recent developments in
political circles, which threaten not only
Mr. Wells, but the entire Republican
ticket with defeat.. The bosses have de
cided that Mr. AVells must be elected at
any cost and orders have consequently
been issued to the push to trade the nom
inees for Supervisors in every possible
way for Wells votes.
Every effort will be made to save the
head of the ticket, he the fate of the re
maining candidates what it may. There
were several conferences between Wells'
managers and the representatives of the
bosses yesterday, the subject of discussion
being ways and means for repairing Mr.
Wells.' shattered fences. The determina
tion was formally reached to knife the
rest of the' ticket in Wells' interests and
orders to that effect were accordingly is
sued. >
Bosses Are Alarmed.
"I'll watch 'them closely when I am
Mayor," said he, dreamily. "I think the
Republican ticket will be elected. The
nominees stand on a good platform, one
which the labor element may accept with
confidence. There is a large quiet vote
in this city and I expect to poll heavily
from the class which says little but casts
its vot unfailingly on election day. I am
well satisfied with the situation."
"He is bitter against the party as a
general proposition." was the response,
evasively and slowly uttered. "We had a
talk in the presence of Grove Ayer, but
we could come to no terms. 1 wanted his
support, but he was disgusted with the
convention nominees, and refused to
recognize my claims to consideration at
the hands of The Call on party grounds."
"Did you at that time tell Mr. Spreckels
that you, too, were dissatisfied with many
of the nominees and particularly those for
Supervisors?"
"I believe I did say something of that
kind," answered Mr. Wells, musingly.
"Yes, I think I did."
"Didn't you tell him that if the Super
visors had been nominated first nothing
could have induced' you to accept any
place on the ticket?"
"Something like that."
"What is your present opinion concern
ing the Supervisorial nominees?"
"If I had seen the list of names," re
plied Mr. Wells earnestly, "I would no
more have accepted the nomination for
Mayor than give up my hope of going to
heaven when I die."
Mr. Wells qualified this statement by
saying that he did not mean that all the
nominees were bad. For instance, W. H.
Cobb, who, by the way, is managing Mr.
Wells' political fight, was an excellent
fellow, whose election would be of vast
benefit to the community. Within the last
few days, he added, he had been assured
"that he would like his fellow nominees."
"I don't enjoy it, I can assure you,"
replied Mr. Wells, dolefully.' "It's very
hard to be criticized so after living forty
years in a community. I never did a man
an injury in my lite. I think I enjoy the
respect and confidence of all who Know
me personally. Of course, now that I am
a candidate tor Mayor, I must resign my
self to the inevitable. The papers cannot
find anything of a private nature, upon
which to base their attacks, so tney
criticize me on political grounds. It is
notorious, however, that the Chronicle
opposes my candidacy because Mr. De
"young's brother-in-law was turned down
by the convention. Mr. Spreckels of The
Call also has a grievance."
"Will you explain its nature?"
Does Not Enjoy Criticism.
"Absolutely nothing," responded Mr.
Wells. "You see, at meetings of that kind
some dissatisfied people always gather.
You can't please "everybody."
"What do you think of tne attitude of
the Republican morning dailies toward
you?" -was asked.
ABA R. WELLS, candidate for
Mayor on the Republican ticket,
freely admitted to a Call repre
sentative yesterday that he was
dissatisfied with his party's
nominees for Supervisors. He stated with
positiveness that had he seen the list of
names- of the nominees before he was
asked to accept the nomination for Mayor,
"he would no more have accepted the
nomination than he would give up his
hope of going to heaven when he dies."
Mr. Wells was in a jovial mood yester
day. Some one connected with the county
committee had convinced him that his
reception at Metropolitan Hall Saturday
evehing "was an ovation and that his
speech was the sensation of the hour. The
Auditor was satisfied with the prospects,
and . his propensity . for discussing the
weighty issues of the campaign again
asserted itself to some purpose.
"What do you think or the Metropolitan
Hall meeting?" was asked.
"It was a delightful affair," answered
Mr. Wells. "Don't you think so? Why,
I can hear those shouts yet. The audience
,was a fine one from a political stand
point."
"What did those hisses mean?"

While T have promised to adhere to all the
planks of the Democratic platform, there ta
one In particular in regard to which 1 woul-3
like to reaffirm my faith. That is the onÂ» re
ferring to the re-enactment of the Chinese
exclusion act.
\u2666 i sa Â£. tnat municipal government is not poli
tics, to this large conservative representation
of people of the Mission, with its thousands of
property owners, the question in th a cam
paign is, "Who are the men who have served,
me faithfully in the past and thus given prom
ise of serving me hest in the iu ure?" low
taxation is oae of the benefits whicn the prop
erty-owners desire. With them it is a tiuea
tlon of whether or no the government ia to bs
carried Â°n 'or the best interests of the people.
My opponent during his s P e.ch Saiuruay
nigni at Metropolitan Temple saia: "l ihirir;
that I know- much about the needs, the require
ments that are necessary to conduct ths af
fairs of our city government. I know that
the Mayor is clothed with extraordinary pow
ers and that many people are apt to mini' . n-it.
he is the whole thing. That is not Â»o. With
out the aid of a harmonious Board of Snppr
viaors the Mayor is comparatively harml-;Â«i
and he has a hot place. Therefore I sa l- 'nÂ«Â»i
it is Important, very imoortant. that the Mayor
should be surrounded bv a Board of- Sup-"r
visors of the same political faith as himself."
Now I would like to call the attention of th9
afternoon paper which is advocating the elec*
tion of Mr. Wells and the defeat of the Re
publican candidates for Supervisors to the
foregoing statement. Mr. Wells complimented
the Democratic Board of Supervisors, yet h*
advocates the selection of the Republican nom
inees.
Municipal government is business, not roll
tics. I desire to talk to you plainly and sin
cerely, as one business man to another. I am
not here as a politician to gather your votes.
II a man should come to me with votes to sell
I would at once convince him that he had
come to the wrong man. I am in the cam
paign to be elected, but not at such a price.
I am desirous of expressing my utter abhor
rence for those v.-ho have in the pas: fed
themselves fat on the emaciated body politic
of San Francisco.
JOSEPH S. TOBIN, the Democratic
candidate for Mayor, and the other
nominees on the Democratic ticket
addressed a large and enthusias
tic meeting of the citizens and
property holders of the Mission last
night in Mission Opera Hall. During the
meeting, which was by far the largest
assemblage of voters in that section of
the city during the present campaign, the
greatest enthusiasm was displayed. Can
didate Tobin in his address declared that
he stood for the conducting of the affairs
of the municipality on a strictly business
basis, that he favored low taxes on prop
erty and finally that he was unalterably
opposed to the admission of Asiatics to
competition with American free labor.
Charles D. South called the meeting to
order and introduced Stephen V. Cos
tello as the chairman of the evening. Mr.
Costello in introducing the Democratic
standard-bearer declared that the election
of Mr. Tobin's opponent meant the return
of Kelly and Criramins, with their ac
companying gang of corruptionists, to
tne control of the municipality. In conv
paringv the Democratic and the Republi
can candidates for Mayor he said that tb
former was young, energetic and fr*
from all corporation control, while the
latter was incapacitated by age and the
professed nominee of corrupt bosses.
When Candidate Tobin was introduced,
he received cheers which lasted for mora
than a minute. After expressing his ap
preciation of the hearty reception accord
ed him, Mr. Tobin spoke in part as fol
lows :

Asa R. Wells, the candidate for Mayor on the Republican ticket, has virtually repudiated

view with a Call reporter yesterday Mr. Wells said that he ivould under no circumstances have
accepted the' nomination for Mayor had he first seen a list of names of candidates for Supervisors
to run with him on the same ticket. He said:
"If I had seen the list of names I would no more have accepted the nomination for Mayor
than give tip my hope of. going to heaven zvhen'I die."
. Mr. Wells does not condemn all the nominees, however. He spoke in favorable terms of his
political manager, W. H. Cobb, who, he said, zcas an excellent fellow', whose election ivould be of

bulkhead doors must have been open, and
denied all the stories of drunkenness on
the part of \u25a0 himself and the late Captain
Foote. Two firemen told of the closing of

given that all the doors were Bhut.

This is almost a case of Insubordination on,
board of a ship* at sea. If the < apta'.n had
usad his authority as master of the ship and
the enRineers had refused to cbay all would
have been held . liable to revocation of the r
papers, but It seems by the evidence they
slc~>ed the letter Just at the simple request of
their chief, -without any consideration of the
consequences, which, to say the least, was a
cowardly act and ought to be condemned by all
good men who go to sea.
There seerrs to be no que-tion but that the
ship . was in good condl.lon to rerfo.m her
voyage, and 1 . If Mr. Cree, the chief, had been
in his right mind he never would have in

out much experience, submitted to their le
quest and decided without further controversy
to return to his home port for repairs to tho
boilers and to get better coal. .
\u25a0 Here was a ship well on her passage to her
port of destination, and at .Dutch Hatbor
plenty of coal could be had, If the 3000 tons
the ship had on board was not sufficient to
make steam. But the simple-minded man at
the head of the engineer 8" department dis
covered all at once that the coal was poor and
a few of the tubes were leaking, which hÂ«
cave as his reason for not proceeding on the
voyage. AVhen the shlp-.w.'*' iuaded tor a home

steam, as the log shows a speed of nine and
a half and ten knots on her run up the straits.
SEATTLE, Oct. 21.â Captain John Al

has had his license suspended for ninety
days, and Duncan Cree, her chief en
gineer, suffers the revocation of his
papers, for bringing the vessel, which
sailed on September 20 for Nome, back

unsafe, owing to "leaky boilers and poor
coal," to proceed on the voyage. The
Board of Inspectors' decision, in part,

Forest Fire Near Monterey.
Last year when the Government noti
fied the citizens of Nome of its charitable
intentions about 200 persons who had the
means and would otherwise have come
down on passenger steamers played the
part of hypocrites and allowed themselves
to be taken care of by the Government.
Several of theso fraudulent "destitutes,"
it was found afterward, brought down
pokes of from $300 to $3000 each. To avoid
a repetition of these frauds it has been
made to appear in Nome that no one
would be brought out by the Government
this year. As a consequence all those
except the really deserving poor will
have come out by the time it Is known
that Uncle Sam is to take a hand. â¢ .
The method of this diplomacy was
somewhat novel. It is not generally
known that a revenue cutter can. accom
modate large numbers of passengers.
This, however, Is true. The cutters Bear,
Thetis and McCulloch have remained at
Nome to the veiy close of the season, os
tensibly to protect the merchant marine.
This was only partly the case, as the cut
ters are to bring down the indigent gold
seekers.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21.â "Let it all

yer, in his last will and testament, speak
ing of life, love and happiness, also of
what he would like to say, for "life is all
a long, strange dream," he adds.
This will forms one of the queer exhib
its in the case of the people vs. Theodore
S. Shaw, now being tried before Justice
James in the Township Court by Deputy
District Attorney Willis. The complain
ing witness is Mary A. Shaw, wife of the
defendant, who charges her husband with
cruelty and with having choked her when
he was arunk. On the otner hand, Law
yer Bhaw, who is conducting his own
case, greatly to his wife's admiration, as
serts mat sne tried to induce him to com
mit suicide ana says he drew up this will
under the inlluence of her persuasion.
Mrs. Shaw repudiates the charge that
she tried to get her husband to commit
suicioe, but asserts, on the contrary, that
he -threatened to do fo without persuasion.
She adds that the will was drawn up by
her husband when he had threatened .to
kill himself and she points to the loving
terms he uses in mentioning her in the
will. She also denies that she has a vio
lent temper and again cites the will as a
proof. The will in part is as follows:
Believing that I am approaching death, with
the certainty of death and the un?ertainty of
life. 1 will, dev s; and 1 e .tuath all my lands,
mineral claims, oil claims and intenst.. of

THEO. S. SHAW.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
Virod was so far from civilization that
he made no attempt to report his discov
ery, waiting until he had to \u25a0 journey â¢ in
for his winter's supplies.
"What was the use?" was his remark
to-day. "The coupie had been gone so
lor.iir that they couldn't have been caught
anyhow."
Virod. when he had overcome his aston
ishment, decided that all that could be
done was to dig a grave and inter the
trunk and its human contents. Decom
position- had proceeded so far that he
made no close examination of the little
corpse. He believed it was that of a girl
â¬ or 8 years old.
The cause of death was easy to deter
mine from the great cleft, evidently made
with an ax. that split the skull from
for=head to crown. The legs had ap
parently been broken with the same in
strument.
Body That of a Child.
Virod did not even grlance into the old
turnel. whose mouth was partly over
prown with shrubs. He was busy, he said,
and the whole affair was forgotten by the
r.e>:t day. Seme time in August he went
to the tunnel and to hisÂ« astonishment saw
a trunk standing partly concealed by
sticks at the back of the hole. A horrible
fight met the prospector's eyes as he
pried back the lid. Curled up inside were
the mclderir.g remains of a child, with
the arms pressed close to the sides and
the limbs bent back over the body and
evidently broken.
The strangers, Virod says, asked to stay
all night and were cheerfully welcomed.
Fi:fty vards from the shack was an old
tunnel'mrmin^ fifteen or twenty feet into
the side of a hill, where some one had a
year or two before given up a search for
Quartz. The prospector's cabin had but
one room and the couple elected to stay
in the tunnel, where they could build a
fire, they said. They did so and when
Virod retired at midnight they were still
6if:ing by their fire talking. In the morn
ing they were gone.

WAI-LA WALLA, Wash., Oct. 21.â Two
months ago Frank Virod. a prospector in
the Salmon River country, found in an oid
tunnel near his shack a trunk containing
u human body, bent and twisted to fit tho
receptacle that held it. It had been left
ihsre by a man and woman who passed
through six weeks before. Each of tho
appeared to be about 40 years
cf age. They were not prepossessing in
appearance. What mystery the trunk and
its ghastly contents concealed may never
be known, but Virod is of the opinion that
the couple that left it at his ulace hail
besn hired to get rid of a child that stood
in somebody's waÂ».\
]n June Virod entered the country above
the headwaters of the Salmon Kiver to
pr aspect. He built a rude hut in a ravine.
in July the mysterious couple appeared
late one evening. They said they had lost
their waj\
"It struck ne as being funny," s^aid
Vircd, "that a man and a woman should

most men hesitate to go with a pack
horse, but 1 was glad to see the lirst hu

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PRESCOTT, Wash.. Oct. 21.â Because
the parents of Myrtle Marr and Alta
Reavls, 17 and 16 years old, respectively,
would not let them marry they startled
Prescott last night with a double elope
ment. Their partners were Timothy Shea
and Clifford Reavis. whose ages are 20
and 19 years. A hard raca Is on between
the youthful . lovers and the officers In
every town between here and Seattle,
with the chances apparently in favor of
the officers.
Shea and Rea\ls met the girls early last
evening. At 5 o'clock they were at the
Oregon depot, but four hours later sud
denly took a carriage for Riverside, a
small station seven miles west, on the
Washington and Columbia River Rail
road. Here they boarded a train and went
to Eureka Junction, where Shea pur
chased four tickets for Seattle.
All the persons concerned are promi
nent.- Shea's lather Is a rancher at Col
ville Springs, seven miles northeast of
here. Miss Marr's people live at the edge
of town, and the Reavises are close
neighbors. Shea is a strapping Irishman,
curly and handsome. Both the girls are
pretty, but Alta Reavls Is scarcely more
than a child.
William Reavis objected to Clifford
Reavis because he was a second cousin
of the girl and was too young to know
what marriage meant. Clifford worked
on the farm for William Reavls, who had
reared him. Clifford and Myrtle were,
brought up together like brother and sis
ter. Strenuous efforts are being made to
catch the elopers.
ROOSEVELT APPOINTS
A GOLD DEMOCRAT
George E. Koester Chosan Collector cf
Internal Rsvenue for South
Carolina.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â The President
to-day appointed George E. Koester Col
lector of Internal Revenue for South
Carolina. With the appointment the fol
lowing statement was issued:
"Mr. Koester is a prominent gold Dem
ocrat and has been recommended for the
position* by a large number of influential
business men and representative citizens,
not only of South Carolina, but of North
Carolina and elsewhere."
The appointment of Koester terminates
a controversy which devolved upon Roose
velt with his accession to the Presidency.
It was in connection with this appoint
ment and that of former Governor Jones
to a Federal Judgeship in Alabama that
the President announced that his policy
would be to name suitable Republicans if
they could be found and if not to appoint
Democrats. *
Mr. Blalock, who has been long identi
fied with the Republican party in South
Carolina, at first was understood to be
slated for this position, but the President
later decided not to appoint him. Sub
sequently Senator McLaurin, whom the
President consulted about the matter,
suggested the name of Mr. Koester.
part responded in the same spirit to the
appeal of the United States, and alto
gether the two governments, Turkey and
Bulgaria, probably have been put to a de
gree of expense equal to the amount of
ransom demanded by . Miss Stone's cap
tors In the military operations they have
already directed in her interests.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 21.â The offi
cials of the United States Legation are
still without news from the missionaries
who ap< seeking to make arrangements
with the abductors of Miss Ellen M.
Stone and her companion, Madame H. S.
Tsilka. It is regarded as probable that
the missionaries will use the nearest tele
graph only when the terms of the ransom
are settled, directing where the cash shall
be sent.
LONDON, Oct. 21.â The idea that the
capture of Miss Stone originated with the
Macedonian committee is corroborated,
according to the Vienna correspondent of
the Daily Mail, by the fact that numer
ous Macedonians in Sofia have offered to
mediate with the brigands.
The rumor emanating from a Bulgarian
source that Miss Stone is hidden in the
villayet of Salonika is regarded as very
improbable, says the Sofia correspondent
of the Telegraph. Charles H. Dickinson,
United States Consul General at Con
stantinople, is still firmly convinced of the
complicity of the Macedonian committee.
In missionary circles the view is favored
that when the ransom Is paid the brig
ands will also be granted amnesty, and
that all records of agreement with the
band shall be canceled. l
Very Fast Battleship.
BOSTON, Oct. 21.â Russia's latest
American-built battleship, the Retzivan,
was put through her paces to-day over
a ten-mile measured course off the I3le
of Shoals, and under natural draught at
tained a speed over a twenty-mile course,
according to her builders, of 18.01 knots
per hour, one one-hundredth of a knot
over her contract speed. The usual tidal
correction probably will slightly increase
this.

' REVOLUTIONARY WARâ H., City.
This department has received several
communications in answer to the ques
tion relative to the exact date of the clod

of. the information refers positively to
any specific act which declares when the
war terminated. The War Department at
Washington declares that it cannot au
thoritatively determine a question which
is still a matter of dispute. Colonel A. S.
Hubbard, registrar of the California His
torical Society, who has given the matter
a great deal of attention, is of the opin
ion that the official act which settles the
termination of that war is the one of the
Sd-of November, 1783, when the officers of
the army were placed on half pay. .'%T-

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Large planets situated far from the sun exercise a powerful
control over comets venturing into their neighborhood, and
rhere have been several comets whose orbits indicated that
they had suffered disturbance somewhere In the vast abysm
of space beyond the known borders of the solar system.
There are seven of these comets, according to the calcula
tions of Professor Forbes of Edinburgh, which unite the silent
testimony of their orbits in support of the hypothesis that at
the enormous distance of more than nine : thousand million
miles from the sunâ a hundred times the earth's distances
there circles in lone majesty a planet mightier than the great
Jupiter himself, and requiring about a thousand years to com
plete a single journey about the sun. \u25a0
The suggestion that there is an undiscovered planet belong
ing to our system greater than Jupiter is. in itself, startling,
for Jupiter has never yet had a known rival among planets.
He is 1300 times larger than the earth, and^so massive that
if all the other planets â except the as yet unseen but suspected
monster beyond Neptune^-were thrown together in the scalo
against him he would outweigh them almost three to one.
In fact, as far as size is concerned, there is less difference
between Jupiter and the sun than there is between the earth
and Jupiter. ,'. ,\u25a0'\u25a0"--.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has. given notice
that there are to be no docktailed horses in the
White House stables while he is President, and
the .King', of England has ordained that no such
horses shall appear in the ceremonial processions of
coronation day. We have here, then, an instance
where fashion is . confronted by the protest of the
two highest leaders of 'the English-speaking : world,
and it is to be seen how far a good example set in
high places can counteract the effects of a bad
custom.
The practice of docking the tails of horses can.be
defended only on the ground that it lightens the work
of lazy grooms and saves careless drivers from the ne
cessity of watching that the tail of^ the horse is not
switched over the reins. It takes' some little time
end skill to keep the tail of a horse as clean as that
of a well groomed horse should be, and the grooms
are very glad to be saved that trouble. It requires,
too, in fly time pretty close attention on the part of
the coachman to keep his reins free from the swing
ing of an undocked tail, and the average coachman is
very glad to be relieved of that care. The owners of
horses, have yielded to the desires of grooms and
coachmen and have mutilated their horses and spoiled
much of the ; beauty of their animals by consenting.
to -have the tails docked.
Custom has made the fashion. Many persons pre
fer to have docktailed horses merely because other
people have them. The docktail is the fashion, and the
crowd that makes up the society world has no more
idea of it's own that any other crowd. The individual
will and reason is lost in the will of the crowd, and
! the whole social ;set moves like a, band -of monkeys,
each intent on imitating the one just in front of' him.
It is gratifying that the President of, the -.United
States ;and the King of England are riot "\u25a0 imitators.
They have now'set agood example for reasonable men
to follow... The enactment of laws against the docking
of horses' tails has been found to.be ineffective. In
no State has it-been possible to' enforce the law. It
\u25a0now remains to be seen what" can be accomplished by
right leadership. President Roosevelt's example \u25a0 : is
worthy of the imitation of evÂ«ry owner gi horses. It
is much better than the blind following Jof a foolish
and cruel fashion. It wilUbe interesting to note how
many of the so-called leaders â¢ of. .society will prove
themselves worthy of the title by really leading in the
way of reform and how many will' show themselves
to be after all : not leaders but mere slaves of fashion
by. continuing to act in the old -way. '
' It will be seen that Great.-Britain derives more than
one-third, of her., entire revenue from alcoholic
liquors, a'nd that the United States is the only nation

BY -the British Board of Trade there have been
recently compiled ;a series 1 of. statistical tables
\u25a0 showing the production and consumption of
alcoholic liquors among the nations of the world and
the extent to which such^ articles are made to bear
the burdens of taxation.. The statistics for several of
the countries are old, as late information was not ob
tainable, but those for the United States, France,
Germany and Great Britain relate for the most part
to the year 1900.
As is well known, France leads in the consumption
of w"ine. In the year 1900 the consumption there
amounted to more than 983,000,000 gallons, being
equal to a per capita consumption in excess of 25 gal
lons. In the same year the Germans consumed some
thing morp tha,n 81,000,000 gallons, or about 1.45 per
capita. The consumption in the United States was
over 25,000,000, the per capita being only about one
third of a gallon. The British wine consumption was
a little less than 16,000,000 gallons, or a per capita
jof 0.39.
In the consumption of beer. the British lead when
contrasted with any other people taken as a whole,
though they fall far short of the per capita consump
tion of the inhabitants; of some of the South German
states. Thus the Bavarian consumption amounts to
fifty-four. -gallons a head, while the British per capita
is. but 31.7. Taking Germany as a whole, however,
the per capita consumption; is but 27.5, which thus
leaves the British in the lead despite the drinking
capacity of the Bavarians and the Wurttembergers.
In this country the consumption. of beer is given at
above 934,000,000' gallons in 1900, or a per capita
of 13.3- ' ?'* - \u25a0 - \u25a0 'â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 '\u2666
DOOKTAILED HORSES.
THE NATIONS AS 'DRINKERS.
THE Tacoma News dwells at length, and with
zest, upon what it calls "San Francisco's De
cadence." It is incited to this pleasant duty by*
the report of the Agricultural Department upon the
wheat industry. That report says: "About 27,450,
000 bushels of wheat are exported annually on the
Pacific Coast, with a total value of about $20,000,000.
Of the 2,000,000 barrels of flour annually shipped from -
Pacific Coast ports during the last ten years nearly
one half is cleared at San Francisco. It has taken
iibout 36,000,000 bushels of wheat to |upply the for
eign markets with Pacific Coast wheat and flour.
Of this amount California supplied more than 20,
000,000 bushels."
The Xews resents this statement of a decade as
'"a puff for San Francisco," and proceeds to show the
rise of the wheat business in the last three years in
-Oregon arid Puget Sound ports, and foresees the
time when San Francisco will stand third in the list
as a shipper of wheat and flour. That prospect does
not mean the decadence ot this city. Time was that
California imported -the wheat and flour consumed by i
her people. Her chief industries then were mining :
and stock-raising. Wheat is the first step in advance
of pastoral industry. This State took that step, and
as she had been foremost in mining and stock
raising she took the lead in wheat production. The
fame of her crop filled the world and attracted the
attention of every flour-eating country. But our cli
mate indicated a still more profitable agriculture than
' wheat-raising, and California now holds the world's
record in horticulture.
Wheat-raising was proved a nobler use of the soil
than stock- growing, and -now fruit-raising appears as
a more profitable use than wheat-growing. It is not
the fault of the prosperous States and seaports in the,
north that our soil and climate permit a ; greater >va-V
riety of profitable production than theirs! It'is not
their fault that our physical conditions enable us to
do more things with profit than they can do.
- In the season of 1890 we shipped from San Fran
cisco 13.728,442 centals of wheat and 1,174,974 barrels
\u25a0of flour. In 1900 we shipped 6,519,771 centals of
wheat and 1,195,783 barrels of flour. That was a loss
of 7,208.671 centals of wheat and a gain of 21,609 bar
rels of flour. If the State's output and export had sus
tained that as a net ' loss, with ; nothing to take its
place, the News might be justified in its exultation
over, what it calls our "decadence." Our other exports
_of. products that occupied the soil as wheat receded
dufin'gthat decade made the following showing: Green
deciduous fruits increased 57J34-5 tons; citrus' fruits,
192,335 tons; dried fruits, 57,755.3 tons; raisins,-- 15,- (
*'j&7 tons; nuts, 5731.3 tons; canned fruits, 35,496
tons; carloads, .rail and sea, vegetables, 5140; car
loads wine 1 and brandy, rail and sea, 0067.3. Measured
\u25a0by carloads of ten tons eacli, our exports of fruits,
wines, brandy and vegetables in 1890 were 16,195 car
loads, and in 1900 were 66,797 carloads, or an increase
of 50,602 carloads, or 506,020 tons in ten years. So
.that our loss in wheat tonnage is exceeded by the .gain
- in other products by 145,587 tons.
When the soils of the 'north meet the fate of all
wheat soils and decline in production we hope that
they will prove as capable as our productive zone
here of subjection to other uses to make good the

This is not said in personal disrespect to Mr. Wells, and reflectsvupon this fitness
as a public leader only.; As he has failed to see that one of v the- regular, nominees for
Mayor must get the large independent vote in order to beat the .class; nominee, it ;is; nat
ural that.; he should repel the independent vote, and compel the whole city to turn to his
regular opponent, as a measure of safety. Mr. Wells knew that his nomination did not
represent the wish apd will of the- majority of the best Republicans in the city, but it
was in his power to have attracted them by making himself the platform and becoming a
real leader. Instead of doing this he has permitted himself to be instructed in what not
to . say and^ what, nor to do,' until he is as lacking in inspiration to others as a chunk of ice
is in heat. Opportunity knocked at his door but' was not invited in, and will not knock
again. The Call gave. him. ample chance to put himself in line with the sentiment and
safety of the city, but he. faced the other, way.
Come what may, San Francisco must not be sacrificed. The interests of this city
are greater than any man's ambition, its safety more necessary than the success of .any
political boss. Party interests, even were they involved, must be held secondary tolthe
public good. But they are not involved., and need not. enter into any man's action. The
men who are responsible for the convention that? nominated Mr. Wells were actuated by
personal and not party, considerations, and no Republican is under the least allegiance to
their personal schemes and noisome plans. <The Republican: party and the city are both
to be served and saved by repudiation of their programme.'; What right had they to
select such a leader as Mr. Wells in the most serious crisis in the city's history? What
right had they to leave .the chance open for another party tooutgeneral them, by acting
right in line with the occasion by selecting a candidate for Mayor toward whom the city
would be sure to turn, in: repudiation of their own 1 improper, .weak and inconsequential
choice?. The inference of Republicans is that the. convention had a programme which no
other sort of candidate would indorse, and we have no doubt' that inference is correct,
arid' accounts .for the failure to secure a strong, independent and self-poised man for the.
head of the ticket. \u25a0 . â¢' , :- :
When the campaign is over, arid, the public interests have been safeguarded, there
will 'be a chance for some natural politics which Republicans can indorse, and the lesson
will be of advantage to the party and to the selfish and purblind hucksters, who care for
the party- only as parasites care for that. on which they crawl and feed. . .,
[ T is not expected that the Mayor of/a.city like this shall be- a Ghauncey, Depew. or
have the ready speech of General Barnes/ but it is expected that he shall have ideas
about municipal administration^ to which he can give clear expression. If 'he cannot
- *\u25a0 express ideas on that subject the conclusion is that he, has none. .
It is not the fault of Mr. Wells that he is not an orator. "Orators are rare, and the
real members of that guild in California can be counted on the fingers \u25a0 of one hand. : NoV
body expects hini to drive an audience into frenzy by the music of his periods, his cli
maxes and anti-climaxes, his metaphors and antitheses, but his supporters expected him
to avoid 'putting his campaign into cold storage in the frigid air which he created in his
lirst*meeting. His appearance â would have frapped a bottle of hot water, and was com
plete proof of our contention that the convention which nominated him failed entirely
to comprehend the serious situation of the city. r '.j;. "' ; ..;â¢;
<\u25a0?: As'the machine from which his nomination issued like adobe, brick from the mold
lacked; the sense tb see the gVave conditions which threaten . San Francisco,-'it: : is natural
that lietshbuld be "equally blind. But he does not stop with â¢being 'just- as-blind as the
cbnvehtiori.'f If irhad one glass eye he has two. A man :who;felthis responsibility and
â¢knew that to win '.Ire must prove his mettle would by. this time have the wtiole'city think
ing that none other could win. He would have caused the other candidates to'be forgot
ten,'and ;would hÂ£ye been already a winner. Instead of this people are tossing up between
his. two opponents^ and are only wondering whether he will get more votes than
Q'bonnell, provided that remarkable person succeed in litigating his^criame- on. to the

During the year three meetings of the execu

relation to the additional appropriation was

pointed a special committee to draft resolu
tions of respect on the death of our late Presi
dent. William McKlnley, and report the same
to the convention. I would recommend that
we have these resolutions printed on a mourn
ing page of our proceedings.
The increased demand made upon the State
Mining Bureau owing to the increase in tho
mineral production of the State necessitates
more liberal appropriations for its support and
maintenance, and I would recommend that
some action be taken toward the recommenda
tion of the passage of a law that would give
it a permanent Income to carry on the work of
the bureau, so that the friends of the bureau
would not be obliged every two years to go to
the Legislature and ask for appropriations.
I wish to congratulate all of the officers and
committeemen of the association for the prompt
and efficient manner In which they have at
tended to all their duties, and especially the
secretary, who has all of the work to perform
during the year. The members of the execu
tive committee have been prompt, and nearly
all attended the meetings of the committee.
The association owes much to the press of
San Francisco and throughout the entire State
for the courtesies that have at all times been
shown to the association, also to the business
men of San Francisco who have always re
sponded liberally .when asked for financial aid
to carry on the work.
The Union League Club of San Francisco is
deserving of the thanks of the association for
its kindness in giving the executive committee
the use of its rooms for committee meetings.
Words of Encouragement.
In their welcoming addresses Gov
ernor Gage and Mayor Phelan found
little that was new to say.
Governor Gage said that the j Govern
ment ought not to ignore the people of
California and the people of California
should never forget the debt of gratitude
that they owe. to sturdy miners, for It,
was the mining Industry that created the
nucleus of California's splendid civiliza
tion. Broadmlnded legislation was need
ed to protect the farmer,, and at the-'
same time to guarantee the welfare of
the great mining- Interests of the State.
Nowhere can capital be more profitably
invested to-day than in developing the
mineral resources of California.
Mayor Phelan said that every street in
San Francisco bore testimony to the Cali
fornia miner. Buildings have been erect
ed with the money of Mackay, Flood,
O'Brien, Hayward and other miners. The
name of Mackay was also connected, ap
propriately, with' an enterprise Involving
the use of gTeat quantities of metal, the
Atlantic cable, in which he was inter
ested.
Mr. Phelan welcomed the j delegates
heartily. He remarked that - Robert
Louis Stevenson had called ? San Fran
cisco the smeltlner-pot of the world, and
the city accepted that name, well pleased
with it. Mayor Phelan said that Presi
dent Roosevelt was in sympathy with the
West and that was a favorable sign for
the success of the movement for a Cabi
net representation for the mining indus
try of the country, for the pressure for
such representation came from the West

Californians in New York.
During the past ten years, or ' since tho
organization of the California Miners' Associ
ation, the delegates to the State Convention
have been elected by county organizations, ap
pointed by Boards of Supervisors, Boards of
Trade Chambers of Commerce and other such
organizations. To the branch county organiza
tions one delegate to each ten members has
been the ratio of apportionment. In some
instances more delegates often desire to attend
the State Convention than their county organi
zation would permit. It also sometimes occurs
that unfriendly feelings are engendered In the
strife to be elected as delegates, which I think
eouldVrie avoided by broadening the scope of
the State association and allowing every mem
ber a seat and a voice in .the deliberations of
the annual convention, and I would suggest
that a committee be appointed to revise. the
.by-laws of the association so that every mem
ber who contributed his annual dues to carry
on this work could feel that he* had a perfect
right to come to San Francisco and participate
in the work of the annual convention. The
State membership of the association Is about
9000; the annual number of delegates elected to
attend the State Convention is about 500. I
think the Influence of a State meeting of 1000
-Â«â¢ 2000 members would be far greater than a
For Benefit of Miners.
â\u25a0 - |
fornia Debris Commission made estimates of
the cost of the work to be $SOO,000.
our representatives in the State Legislature
secured a further appropriation of *150.Â°W. and
the national Government will undoubtedly ap
propriate a like sum-in all $*W,000 to build
barriers according to the plans of the Federal
engineersâ and preliminary work is now being
done such as securing the necessary land for
the restraining barriers, but the engineers are
having some difficulty in securing the land
they deem necessary for that purpose. We
trust however, they may be able to overcome
these' difficulties and soon start the actual work
of construction.
This association has done everything in Its
power to aid in the passage of the so called
Lands Bill," which was before the
last Congress, and received favorable reports
from the committees, but we are toM owing
to the lack of time It died on the files and
\u25a0will have to be reintroduced when the new
Congress meets next December. Much could be
said upon the merits of this bill and the bene
fit it would be to the prospecting miner if the
bill could be passed and become a law, and
here I wish to congratulate the members of
the national Congress from California for their
untiring efforts in support of this bill during
the last session of Congress, and If the same
energy is used by the members at the coming
cession of Congress I have no doubt but what
they will succeed in. passing the bill and have
it become a. law upon the statute books.
At our last annual session the Petroleum
Miners' Association Joined us in our deliber
ations and have worked harmoniously with us
during the past year for the passage of such
laws as would be beneficial for that industry,
which is now assuming great magnitude in
this State and Is adding to its wealth.
The mineral productions of the United States
are growing so very rapidly that the annual
value is estimated at more than $1,000,000,000.
It Is right and proper that the mining; industry
of the United States should have of the Gov
ernment more protection and assistance, which
could be better facilitated through a Cabinet
department of the executive branch of the
Government, and if those engaged In the dif
ferent branches of mining: throughout the
United States will join hands and ask for the
establishment of a Cabinet Officer of Mines
and Mining we certainly ought to be successful
In obtaining It.
President David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford University spoke of the value to the
miner? of the scientific knowledge of
geology, metallurgy, electricity and other
branches taught by, the university. . He
told about one graduate of Stanford who,
three years after he was out of the uni
versity, found ' himself in receipt, of an
annual salary of $33,000, which was p&id
by a Chinese engineering and mining
company. â¢ President Jordan assured the
miners of the assistance of the Stanford
University in promoting the mining in
terests of the State.
J. H. Neff spoke earnestly. He said
that he was \u25a0 glad the convention had
started in the right way by. taking steps
to secure the- option of James O'Brien.
There were three things of leading im
portance to the State, viz., the preserva
tion of navigable waters, . the impound-
College Men Speak.
In the afternoon Congressman Sam D.
Woods made a pleasant address to the
miners. He advised that Congressmen
from this State should be kept for many
terms in Congress. This advice was dis
interested so far as he was concerned,
he said, for he expected to retire to
private life at the close of his present
term as Congressman. The Eastern peb
ple knew that their Congressmen gained
in influence according to length of ser
vice and so returned them repeatedly.
California had contributed great sums
to the national treasury and had received
very little in return.
If millions were needed to enable the
miners to resume operations then the
Government should expend these mil
lions. The National Government had
obligations to this State that could not
be paid in money, but payment should
be made by the Government so far as
possible in money. The work of get
ting the needed improvements was evolu
tionary, and the Yuba River dam was
not an end. but a beginning. He also said
that he had worked for the California
miners to the best of his ability â¢ at
Washington and would continue to do so
as Congressman.

NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â The American
tour cf Sir Henry Irving, Ellen Terry and
\he members of the London Lyceum Thea
ter Company was inaugurated at the
Knickerbocker Theater to-night. The
:heater was filled, society being liberally
represented and the distinguished English
actor and his players were given an af
fectionate greeting. A revival of "King
Charles I." in which Sir Henry fust won
American favor, was selected as the open
ing production. It was sumptuously staged
ar.d splendidly acted! The costumes were
copied from the famous picture.^ by Van
I-Jyke. and the scene in which Charles sur
renders to Cromwell was an exact repro
duction of Van Dyke's conception of it.
The same plan was followed in several of
ihe scents ar.d tableaux. The audience
"vas very enthusiastic. At the close of ihe
performance Sir Henry made a brief
speech in response to the ovation. The
c-ompany will continue at the Knicker
bocker for three v/eeks.

as he is a candidate for the high honor

The three candidates have long been
connected with the First Regiment,

and any one of the trio would be accept-
able to the entire regiment./ They have
the necessary military training to fit them*
for the important position and have had
long experience in military matters. They
are alj young men and have the good of
the regiment at heart.

that he possesses all the qualifications
necessary. As captain of Company D he
twice won the handsome trophy offered
by his Grace Archbishop Riordan. For
many years he was in command of Com

a member of the board of directors.
Major Deasy is in line of promotion. He
is the senior officer of the regiment, as
there is also a vacancy in the lieutenant
colonelcy of the regiment. There is,
however, no set rule as to promotions by
seniority. The late Colonel Edwin F.
Power was promoted over the heads of
officers higher in command, and in the
present instance the same course may be
followed.
Major Power is no relation to the late
colonel of the regiment. He has risen
to the command of the Second Battalion
through sheer ability. He has proved an
efficient officer and has many friends.
Captain Dwyer also has a large follow

In the middle of a fight, and the fight for
that cup has only begun. I certainly mean
to have another try for it, maybe several. -
While Sir Thomas denies that he intends

he would not deny that he would ulti
mately build a new boat. On this subject

What I intend to do is this: I will leave
the Shamrock II on this side. She will re

any and all boats that care to meet her and I
\u25a0will come over myself.
I am not desirous of holding a monopoly in
the matter of challenging for the America's
cup. I propose to wait lor a reasonable time
alter I get back to the other side and see if
any of the other British sportsmen desire to
enter a challenge.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21. -Sir Thomas Lip

cup next year. In an interview late this
evening Sir Thomas absolutely denied that
he had any Intention of bringing a new
boat to compete for the cup next fall. He
said:
Says He Will Hold Back, However,

The records of military commissions
during the year show that SSO persons
were tried, of which number 729 were con
victed and 202 acquitted. The sentences
in forty-nine cases were disapproved.
Murder leads in the number of charges
before these commissions, numbering 317.
Violation of the laws and usages of war
follow with 157 cases, while the charge of
robbery comes next with 106 cases.
General Davis says that death sentences
were imposed by military commissions in
about 2-12 cases, neaxly all natives of the
Philippine Islands, on conviction of more
serious crimes, and the sentences were
executed ir. about 101 cases. In most of
the remaining oases the sentences were
commuted to imprisonment for terms
varying from fifteen years to life impris
onment, while in a few instances the sen
tences were commuted to imprisonment
for from five to ten years, and in a few
other cases the sentences were disap
proved or set aside.

a man came up behind him and cut him
on the back of the ear with a knife. He
was then knocked down and robbed of $20.
He said he recognized Quillici, who used

bill of sale signed by Burke, conveying
the legal volumes to him for $100. Burke
admitted signing the bill of sale, but said
he was too drunk to know what he was
dcing. He "said he wanted the money to
pay his expenses during a sojourn at the

Whereas, On June 25, 1900, this Board of Su

or other inflammable material within the city
and county of San Francisco," and forbidding
any such fences of a greater height than ten
feet to be erected or maintained; and whereas,

A resolution was introduced by Reed at
yesterday's meeting of the Supervisors
which is intended to prohibit freak ad
vertising cn street cars and the public
streets. Reed explained that the measure
â¢was a re-enactment of an ordinance on
the subject passed by the board, but
since declared unconstitutional by the
Police courts because the second section
discriminated against the carrying of
banners or placards with advertisements
thereon. The new ordinance, which elim
inates the section named, was referred to
the Police Committee, and follows:
The preliminary examination Of William
Buckley, Thomas Moran, Charles Donnel
ly and Edward Duncan on the charge of
murder for clubbing, shooting and killing
George TV. Rice, a non-union machinist,
at Twentieth and Howard streets on the
evening of October 11 was commenced be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday. Buckley
was represented by ex-Judges Ferral and
Murphy, Moran by Attorney George If.
Collins and Donnelly by Attorney Hutton.
The prosecution was represented by At
torneys Peter F. Dunne, Joseph F. Coffey
and Assistant District Attorney Harris.
It was decided to first take the evidence
of W. J. Platt, 2496 Howard street, and
his daughter Erline, as they had made
arrangements to leave the city for some
time. Piatt was the first witness exam
ined. He related getting on the car with
his daughter and when It arrived at
Twentieth and Howard streets a man
who was in front of him on the dummy
Kot off and met another man who got off
the rear of the car and struck him on
the head several times with a club, knock
ing him down. As the man who was
knocked down lay on his back on the
cobblestones rolling his head from side to
side another man went up to him and
fired four shots into his body. He chased
the shooter, who ran down Twentieth
street toward Shotwell, for about 150
yards and then returned to the car. He
identified Moran es the man who did the
clubbing and Buckiey as the one who
fired the four shots. He was subjected
to a long and severe cross-examination,
but his evidence was not shaken in any
material point.
Erline, his daughter, who is 14 years o*
age, positively identified Buckley as the
man who fired the four shots, but she
cculd not identify Moran. She said that
Buckley was hanging on to the pole in
front of her and a lady and when theÂ»
car reached Twentieth street the lady
poked Buckley in the back, as he was
in her way of getting off. She- poked him
a second time and he turned around and
scowled at her. She saw a man clubbing
another man and Buckley jumped off the
car and fired four shots at the man who
was clubbed and knocked down. Her
cross-examination will* . commence this
morning.

James G. Maguire argued for three
hours yesterday in support of his motion
for a new trial of the Craven-Fair deed
case. He made a point of the fact that
the handwriting experts who testified at
the trial in which the deeds were declared
forgeries failed, with one exception, to
take into consideration that on September
24, 1S94, the date on which it was claimed
he signed 'the documents. Senator Fair
was suffering ffom palsy, and that there
fore a great change was bound to occur
in his signature. . .The trial will be re
sumed to-day.

which prostrated the Chief some months

Chief of Police Sullivan has been con
fined to a bed since last Thursday, and be

dangerously ill.
Captain Wittman, who is acting Chief,
said yesterday afternoon that the physi

The prevailing opinion Is that Lowe,
having indulged too freely In Ukiah
cheer, was mentally befuddled and really
believed he was doing the proper thing
when he took the child aboard the train.
His bewildered brain evolved the theory
that as the youngster was playing near
the station .Its' parents must have been
passengers on the excursion train, who
had carelessly neglected to take it with
them into a car.
URIAH, Oct. 21.â William H. Lowe of
San Francisco, who kidnaped 3-year-old
Harold C. Sloper, the prize-winning .baby
of the late Santa Rosa street fair, whom
he found playing near the California
Northwestern station In this city yester
day, was brought back to . Ukiah from
Santa Rosa by Deputy Sheriff Charles
Smith this morning. He was taken be
fore Justice Critchfleld this afternoon
and held for preliminary examination,
with bail fixed at $1500. He has engaged
John C. Ruddock as his local attorney.
Lowe says he had no Intention of kid
naping the child, but was acting the part
of a good Samaritan, believing the baby
belonged to a passenger on the excursion
train. When asked why he did not report
the matter to ihe conductor before taking
the child seventy miles from Its home, he
claimed he was looking through the cars
for its parents during the trip to Santa
Rosa.

The members of the various parishes
have transformed the Pavilion into a ver
itable bower of beauty, and nothing more
artistic could be conceived than the many
booths that line each side of the building.
It would be difficult to select a booth
more artistic than its companion. The
cathedral booth is decorated in the papal
colors â yellow and white â and is filled
with artware and bric-a-brac, paintings,
tapestry work and other works of art.
St. Mary's booth is in imitation of an
old mission, with flanking towers, bells
and growth of ivy leaves. Some beautiful
paintings by the Sisters of the San Ra

SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 21.â A peaceful art
ist and a sharp clawed wildcat to-day en
gaged in a deadly battle on the hills near
San Anselmo. Victory went to the artist,
who beat the cat to death with his easel.
Doniinick Needham went to a knoll
back of San Anselmo this morning to fin
ish a painting of " Mount Tamalpais.
While engaged at this work his attention
was 'suddenly called to a small object
playing near him. Closer inspection
proved it to be a small wild kitten. Mr,
Needham, believing this a good opportu
nity to gain a pet, grabbed the kitten.
There was a faint cry and then, the moth
er wildcat came bounding upon the scene
from fhe adjacent brush. She alighted
upon the artist, who commenced to battle
for his life. Shaking the enraged feline
from him, he grabbed his easel and. with,
sundry swats stunned the brute and ulti
mately killed it. In the melee the kitten
left foreparts unknown and could not be
found. \u25a0
All that remains to. remind Mr. Needi
ham of his exciting 1 experience -is his
shattered paraphernalia, an assortment of
scratches and a spotted pelt some forty
inches in length.

â¢!CEW YORK. Oct. 21.â Speculative sentiment
Viontlnucd profoundly dubious to-day, but in
ttead of the conflicting movements of prices
ard the confusion which have reflected this
onndition for some time past, the stock market
[Â£nk into a lethargy. Even the professional
operators seemed to give up the idea of at
tempting to foresee the future movement of
prices. It would be necessary to go back a
year to (jnd a pimMar period of dullness. Last
week's transactions on the stock exchange fell
below .the correepondinE period of last year for
the first time during the present calendar year.
This iact end to-day's dullness, which was
cvt-n more marked, are striking evidences of the
r.neertainty which has overcome the specula
tion, due to The emergency of the Xorthern Pa
cific problem and the disclosure of the fact that
the actual terms of a settlement still remain
to be afrreed upon. , While the incumbency of
the conciliation board of directors or course af
fords a strons guarantee against the outbreak
of the quarrel again the members of that body

before them of finding a plan which will be ac
ceptable as a final settlement to both parties

<if the load of securities carried for control now
by means of bank loans. Incoming foreign
mails disclose that the importance of this prob
lem if fully r^cgrnized throughout the financial
world and its state of Fuspenslon acts as a
repressive influence on speculation. The contin

Northern Wheat Market.
: CHICAGO, Oct. 21.â Traders had expected a
bull day 5n wheat, partly on the rumor that
a line of short wheat would be covered for the
! account of a prominent "broker who died yes
1 terday. Liverpool cables were up to start with
, and December opened U@%c, advanced to 714s
<g'71%(&73%c. A little early covering even ad
vanced the price to 71%c, but a sharp decline
in cables set commission houses and prominent
professionals selling long lines, and the only
support left was a little scalping by pit trad
ers. There was more bullish" Argentine news,
but that had only a short-lived influence. A
considerable visible increase also depressed
prices and December sagged off 1 cent from
its top price for the day and closed weak,
%(ffi%c under Saturday's close, at 70%c.
Liquidation was the principal factor in the
corn pit following upon the depressing influ
ence of the sag in wheat, and December closed
weak, %<Â£%c lower, at 53%@55%c
There was an easier tone in oats. December
closed easy, %@%c lower, at 35%c.
Provisions were dull and fairly steady. A
6teady hog market lent an upward tendency at
the start, but a slow cash demand and weak
ness In grains dissipated any bull movement,
and January pork closed 2%c lower, lard oc
lower and ribs a shade down.

Dried. Fruit in\N*w York.
Latest mail advices from New York say.
"â¢General conditions in dried fruits are quiet
Â«nd trade on spot is without particular feature.
There were, no | further developments in new
Â«lcmeEtic raisins yesterday. Some outside pack
ers continue to quote 6c 'and 6Vic, f. o. b.,
coast, ior choice and fancy new seeded. The
(general expectation is that prices on associa
tion seeded will be made on the coast to-day
and it was Intimated by local representatives
of packers that they will be lower than any
â¢yet narne4. Seeded on spot continue firm and
'in cood demand. New Valencia layers are
moving a little more freely at 7g7Vic_ De
xn&nd for Bultar.as also is â¢ picking up some
irhAt. Old Sultanas are selling more freely
Â«t the last reduction.' S^^lO^c for 2, 3 and 4
Â«rown. There is little call for new Malaga
\u25a0'layers and clusters as yet. â¢
"Currants- are â¢rather quiet; but steady at
5Vc for Amalias. Figs are selling slowly from
â¬filic for layers and 4V;â¬ > 6c for bags. Old
-Halk.Yvi dates are quoted at 2Tfec, with a better
Inquiry. New dates, first tide via London, are
i offered from SvsgS^c for Hallowi. 3%'S'SUc tor
and 2;iS?3c for Salrs.
â¢"New Santa Clara prunes, large sizes mostly,
Â«rÂ« GSered at a 3c basis and it is understood
ft number of cars have sold at that figure.
Spot demand for prunes is light. Apricots,
peachee and other California fruits are quiet
And unchÂ«nsred.
"Brazil nuts are very firm at the last ad
vance and stocks are light. Filberts are easier
cis t!ie other side, the market in Sicily being
equivalent to about Hi: laid down here. The
\u25bapot market is nominally S^c. but \ic less prob
ebly would buy. Shelled nuts are in quite good
Â«Jemand. Valencias and Alicantes are prac

Whether she took the overdose intention

ed by the general Oakland public toward
the construction of the theater. When
the Gottlob-Marx Company quarreled with
the managers of the Macdonough estate
and the theater was closed there was
much bitter complaint. For many months
the doors of the theater have been closed,
until there was even talk of suing for the
bonus, which wa,s subscribed upon the
consideration of the theater being kept
open. ' -
But the announcement of the lease of
the theater has settled everything. Mr.
Hall announces that he will play all of
the regular attractions that come to San
Francisco and that he has already 'begun
his bookings and will be ready to an
nounce dates within a few days.
Mr. Hall's plans in detail cannot be an
nounced, but he says that he will operate
the Macdonough Theater both in connec
tion with the theatrical syndicate's houses
in San Francisco and his own theaters in
the interior of the State. If he does this
he can make a strong circuit that will
include all of the principal towns in Cali
fornia outside of San Francisco and the
syndicate will have to deal with him.
C. P. Hall was formerly .corrected with
the Bush-street Theater In San Francisco.
When that house closed he turned his at
tention to Sacramento, where he has
made a decided success. He has grad
ually extended his Influence over the State
until he now controls a valuable circuit.

proportions, and the actors drew cheers,

meritorious, and though all the actors
were not on the most friendly terms with
their lines the play was heartily enjoyed
bv tlie audience. The scenery was realis

view toward raising the debt
of the â¢ parish, the ladies of

pleted their plans for a bazaar,
which will ' be opened to-morrow even

work he has had the' earnest co-operation
of his people. The special effort at this
time is to pay off existing obligations
upon the parochial residence.

candy and soda water stands, fish pond
and refreshment booth. There will be a
sale of fancy and useful articles.

I regret this course exceedingly, but the
schools cannot be run on talk. To pass the
hat around, as has been suggested, would be
nonsense. It is a disgrace to the city that out
siders should know that we close schools be
cause we are too poor to pay for them.
It is my painful duty to report that our com
mittee has decided to recommend that the night
schools be closed at the end o^ the month. Ten
days are between us and the/end of the month
and in the meantime the Council may do some

Acting on the report submitted by
School Director Isaacs, chairman of the
night schools committee, the Board of Ed
ucation voted unanimously to-night to
close the night grammar schools at .the
expiration of the current month unless
the City Council provides the department
with the necessary funds to maintain
them for the ensuing year. This step has
brought the night school situation to a
crisis and It now devolves upon the Coun
cil to decide whether the night schools
plisll remain open or closed, ten days in
tervening betweenânow and the first of
tlie month in which to take some action.

Chairman Isaacs said:
The reappearance of Avedano in
"Xo:-ma" at the Tivoli last night was the
signal for ringing and long - continued
applause. He was greeted with cheers,
which lasted a full minute, and he re

ringing his opening aria in magnificent
style, which" touched off . the applause
apain and earned him a well deserved
enccre. At the end cf the first act three
ushers were kept busy passing up the
lloral tributes to the popular singer. He
\u25a0was in splendid voice, and his resonant
tenor did full justice to Bellini's beauti

Postmaster Schmidt said to-night that
the woiyt was evidently that of an
i amateur, from the superficial manner in i
which it was done. No attempt v/as made :
to break into the safe, which contained a
considerable sum of money and many
stamps. It was reported to-day that a
quantity of registered mail had been !
I taken, but this Postmaster Schmidt :
| denies. None of the employes are under
I the least suspicion. They all carry keys
' to the office. The ransacking showed eyi
i dence of being done by one not familiar
| with the premises.
I The attempted robbery is connected with
j a similar affair which occurred about a
I week ago. W. C. Moran's real estate office
| in the next block north of the postoffice
| was entered by two men, who broke open
i the rear door. The noise awakened some
! men in the flat above the office and on
i their starting an investigation two men
i were seen to run from the office and dis
! appear in the darkness. Nothing had
! been taken.
BERKELEY, Oct. 21.â Tti"e local post
office on Shattuck avenue was entered
last night, presumably after midnight, by
burglars, who, according to Postmaster
George Schmidt, secured nothing for their
trouble. Misplaced furniture and . dis
turbed mail and cash drawers were left
as evidences of an attempt to secure^
plunder. As the office was not broken into
entrance must have been made through
one of the doors by some one having 'A
key. The employes' door is fastened by a
Yale lock, and it is this one that is sup
posed to have been opened. The attempted
robbery has been reported to the postofflce
officials.

Stn*rt Robson plays Bertie, of course
rnd pictures the iovable simpleton with
nteesc sympathy. The part fits Mm like a

smail voice cf his is lifted into usefulness!
and the v.nole conception is strong and
harmonious. The '-lambs'* confession of
the crgies a la carte of his club, when
he a. id the other dissipated gentry re

Tilth admirable quaintness. The scene

with Mr. Robson, Mr. Arbuckle shares
the honors of the evening. Dorothy

by h<Â»r piquant work as Cornelia OpdyKe
the tfascinating widow. Russ Whytal,
though a trifle melodramatic, is satisfac

Reception to General Smith.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 21.â Not since the boom
of 1SS7 has there been such a demand for
real estate â both city and country â as at
the present time. Besides a bigr influx of
purchasers, the many real estate firms are
receiving inquiries by mail from all over
the United States. In the last month one
firm alone has received 3000 letters from
persons who are desirous of coming to *
California as a result of Eastern adver
tising. The demand for city property is
excellent, and it is almost impossible to
find a suitable house to rent. Vineyard
and orchard homes are sought by East
erners, and many sales have recently been
made. Most of the inquiries are from per
sons in comfortable circumstances, who
desire homes here because of educational .
and climatic conditions. As soon a3 the
full passenger service is resumed on the
coast line again a big incoming of Eastern
tourists is expected.
Boom in San Jose Beal Estate.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 21.â H. G. MacCormack,
after a service of thirty-seven years in
the employ of the Southern Pacific
Company, has resigned the position of
yardmaster In this city. He has been suc
ceeded by T. G. Akers of Truckee, whose
new title will be that of trainmaster. For
many years MacCormack has had charge
of both the bread-gauge and narrow
gauge yards here. MacCormack ranks
among the veterans In the employ of the
railroad company. Most of the thirty-
Eeven years spent in the railroad's service
has been on the coast division, and tie
has seen the train service between San
Francisco and San Jose grow from two
small trains each day to its present vol
ume, when more than twenty-five trains
enter and depart from the city every day.
After a rest. MacCormack will be given
an easier berth somewhere on the coast
division.
.Veteran Yardmaster Retires.
SAX JOSK. Oct. 21.â The Boafd of Su
pervisors of Santa Clara County -will aid
In every way possible to obtain an exten
sion of the Chinese exclusion act, and has
employed P. H. Kewberry to search tho
county records for a report on the crimes
of Chinese. This action is taken at the
request of Congressman Woods and the
staMstics will be sent to him to use in
the fight in CongTess that it la feared will
arise over an extension of the measure.
All Justice and Superior Court records will
be searched for ten years back. As thÂ«
present law expires in May. no time will
be lost in obtaining the information. The
records will display some startling figures,
as Chinese murders have been especially
numerous here, and about ope-half of thÂ»
crimes committed in the can ba
traced to Chinese.

by Special Police Officer Clancv a short
time ago, filed a suit to compel the pay
ment of a life Insurance policy issued to
her late husband by the Mutual Life* In

complaint Mrs. Wilson alleges that the
policy, which was made \u25a0 payable to her
In the event of Wilson's death, was issued
by the company hÂ±ay 27, 1901. She still
further alleges that Wilson paid the first
annual premium on the policy when \u25a0 it

mand, -she alleges, on the insurance com
pany for the amount of the policy, but
payment was refused.
Opticians Hold Meeting.
The California State Association of Op
ticians, met last night in the Alcazar
building to consider the-propositlon of in
corporation. There . were not . enough
members present . to -carry the project
through and the matter will be revived
at the next meeting. A proposition to ap
point'a State board of optical examiners
was incidentally referred to in the debate,
but did not. meet with much, favor. The
oculists who had promised to. deliver ad
dresses failed to appear and the evening
was spent in discussion 'among the mem
bers. -
Joseph Danerl, prosperous liquor dealer
and well-known North Beach politician,
is among the missing, and his wife and
relatives have asked the police to assist
them in the search for him. Danerl, who
keeps a. wholesale and retail liquor estab
lishment at the corner of Montgomery
and Merchant streets, disappeared last
Thursday night, leaving nothing by -which
to trace him save a hurriedly written
epistle directed to his brother, In which
he said he was going far away from, this
city and would never return.
In addition to this Daneri left the sum
of $1000, which he directed should be given
to ril.3 wife for the support of herself and
two children. This money and the letter
to his brother were found in the saloon
cash drawer last Friday morning.'
As soon as Daneri's relatives heard of
his disappearance they called at police
headquarters and begged that a search
be made for the missing man.
It was rumored yesterday that the
missing liquor dealer had eloped with a
woman named Abbott, but an Investiga
tion developed the fact that the Abbott
woman was still in town and j had ! not
seen Daneri since last Tuesday.
Just why Daneri â¢ saw fit to drop sud
denly out of sight is not known. It Js
said that he and his wife, who is now
living with his relatives at" 1028 Powell
street, were not on the best of terms and
that he left town on that account. When
seen last night Mrs. Danerl admitted that
her husband had mysteriously disappear
ed, but claimed that she knew of no rea
son why he should leave town.
"He did not give me the slightest Inti
mation ,that anything serious -was
wrong," she said. "We had a little quar
rel, but it was not so serious that he
should drop suddenly out of sight on ac
count of it. I have heard that he ran
away with another woman, but I do not
believe It."
Daneri has two children, one nine
months and the other two years old.
God does not exoect roses to bloom on
bare rocks.
Relatives Call Upon' Police to
Aid in Search for
Him.
Attorney Scarlan, who objected to sen
tence being passed on his client, filed an
affidavit in which he stated that the clerk
of the court in swearing the witnesses had
not used the form prescribed by law. The
oath administered by the clerk was the
oath prescribed by the Code Commission,
which provided that witnesses should
swear "so help you God." Attorney
Scanlan's- contention was that the Su
preme Court having declared the work of
the Code Commission unconstitutional,
the oath administered should close with
the words "help of God." I
While the objection, which \u25a0 was based
on the ground that all the testimony on
which Swist was convicted was taken un
der the form of oath prescribed by the
codes lately declared void, was overruled
and sentence passed on Swist, It showed
that the Supreme Court decision is likely
to prove a thorn in the side of the Judges
of the middle coi:rt.
A decision rendered in a Stockton court
yesterday caused a great deal of com
ment in legal circles. The decision was
upon an objection to judgment being
passed on a. man named S wist, convicted
of criminal assault, while the codes re
cently declared unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court were in force.

tho proprietor of the Palace of Art sa
loon on Post street, died yesterday after
noon at the residence of Mrs. Joseph
Griffin, 1231 Turk street. Some weeks ago
he contracted a cold, which later devel
oped Into pneumonia,
Gus Hacciuette was in his prime one of
the best known bartenders In San Fran
cisco. For seventeen years he was con
nected with tho warehouse division of tho
United States Government at St. Louis.
Later he was associated with his brother.
He was a splendid specimen of manhood
and was recognized almost anywhere as
a typical "Apollo."
Bartender, Known as One of tha
Handsomest Hen in San Fran
cisco, Passes Away.
A man giving tho name of John L.
Crecd,on, nnd believed by tlio police to
be a professional tramp, was last even
ing treated at tho Receiving Hospital
for a series of knife wounds of the face
nnd nock which he claimed to hnvc re
ceived . at tho hnnds of some unknown
parties. He was sent to the hospital from
O'Farroll and Stockton Btreets by Pollce
mnn Konnell, to whom he .appealed for
surgical aid. His stories of how and where
he received the injuries varied with every
telling. Such of his statements as could
be lnvestlgated / were found to be untrue.
Detectives Dlnnn and Wren sifted the
"under world" without result, and as his
Injuries were not very serious the man
was allowed to leave the hospital late last
night. The police believe he received his
Injuries In a quarrel with some of his
brothers-of-the-road, and ascribe his re
fusal to talk to a well-established law in
"hobo" ethics which enjoins silence in af
fairs of this kind. The man said he was
assaulted at Third and Jessie streets, and
again at Fourth and Minna streets. In
vestigation at both places failed to con
firm his story. He gave his residence as
the King House, 150 Fourth street. This
statement was also found to have no
foundation. .

At noon to-day John J. Barrett, the
well-known and popular young attorney,
will be married to Miss Annie Josephine
Hayes. Father Griffin of St. Jamea
Church will perform the ceremony.
Miss Hayes is a wee bonnle lass, with
a winsome smile, nut brown hair and a
pair of melting blue eyes that have the
trick of appearing at once rouglsh and
tender. Miss Hayes is sure to look lovely
in her bridal attire, which will consist of
a blue silk gown, matching in color the
deep blue of her eye?, and a large white
picture hat, trimmed with exquisite white
plumes.-
Miss Hayes will carry a bouquet of roses
and natural orange blossoms. It Is to be
a very quiet wedding, and only relatives
and a few immediate friends will be pres
ent at the ceremony and the breakfast
which Is to follow.
With the groom, from the East, came
his sister, Miss Gertrude Parker, who is
to be one of the bridesmaids; Charles
Crawford of New York, who is to be best
man, and George Sargent of Chicago,
who is to be one of the ushers.
' For the reception at- the Stubbs home,
wHch will follow the church ceremony,
250 invitations have been issued. There Is
to be no bridal breakfast, and the recep
tion will resemble most a large fashion
able tea with the maid of honor and
bridesmaids assisting 1 the newly wedded
c-iuiple to receive their friends.

come to this city especially to solemnize
the nuptials of his niece and the man of

Tries to Disembowel Himself.
' S. Subski, a Japanese aged 38, residing
at 38 Fourth street, attempted to disem
bowel himself with a pocketknlfe at Cali
fornia and Leidesdorff streets yesterday
forenoon. Two of the knife wounds pene
trated his abdomen. ' ' \u25a0
My! wh.it maRitfficent engagement cups
the Preston girls have got. I have never
seen a prettier, daintier or more extensive
collection, and I certainly have seen anrt
enthused over many a prospective bride's
collection. Dolntlost of all the pretty
cups they have Is, I think, the tiny loving
cup â Just enough for twoâ that is Bessie
Ames 1 gift to pretty Norma Preaton,
llancee of Worthv Ames.
Judge will be driven single, or in case of
nn accident to either of the pair will per

It seems that the North Beach enr
stopped at Kearny street and Broadway
to allow the incoming car. to pass. Jt
stood close to tile switch, which had been
loft open. The motorman. of the other
car, not knowing that the switch wns
open, started to turn into Kenrny street.
As the car struck the switch.it ran on to
tho other track and crushed into the car
which wna waiting for it to pass. The
windows of both cars were badly shat
tered.
That no other passengers were Injured
scorns mlrnculous. There were at least a
half-dozen people on ench enr when the
collision occurred, but many of them
Jumped in timo to save themselves from
being hurt. On account of the, accident
traffic on both lines was delayed for about
twenty minute?.
Immediately after regaining her feet
they claim, she picked up her child, which
was bleeding from an ugly cut over the
eye, and at o"!co loft the scene. Up to s
lnte hour last night th* police were una
ble to locate her.
Pick3 Up Child and Lsaves.
A head-on collision, due to an oper
switch, occurred last night between twe
cars of the Mission and North Beacr
lines at Broadway and Kearny street.
V. Marks, a laborer living at 125 Bay
street, who was a passf-nper on the Xorth
Beacli car, was hurled from his seat anc
severely injured. A woman whose name
is gald to be Mrs. Kane was also hurt
She was sitting on the dummy of the
car, holding her baby in her arms wher
the cars struck. She was thrown from
her feat, but bravely -held on to her help
less offspring. Several eyewitnesses tc
the accident say that the woman wat
knocked down and considerably bruised.
Michael McGlnnlss, 407 Fifth street
while riding on a Folsom-street car wa;
squeezed between the seat and the rea:
end of a truck. The driver attemptec
to clear the track, but the horses backec
and the car bumped into the truck as the
motorman started. McGinniss was sen
to the Receiving'Hospital. His left sid<
was Dadly bruised and it was thought he
had also sustained internal injuries. -"^
James Bohn, 58 years of age, residing a
32 CrOcker street, sustained a fracture<

Hospital.
His Leg Fractured.
Collisions between electric cars occurrec
in two different sections of the city yes
terday morning and evening through th<
failure of electrically operated switches t(
work. The morning accident occurred a:
Eighteenth and Kentucky streets and tha
of the evening at Kearny and Broadway
Besides these there were \u25a0 a number, oJ
minor accidents.
An open switch at the corner of Eight
eenth and Kentucky streets caused thÂ«
first accident on the lines of the Markei
Street Railway Company converging a;
that point. A number of men employee
in the Potrero were on the cars. Car 95:
of the Kentucky and Eighth street lines
in charge of Motorman J. Leach, anc
car 983, in charge of Motorman T. B
Greenwald, collided.
Ma&- of the passengers jumped off ir
order to avoid the impending- accident
but several were injured. William Mortor
oX 570 Fifty-ninth street, Oakland, re
ceived a number of bruises about his legs
besides possible internal injuries. Ernes"
Reith, a carpenter, living at 2621/4 Clars
street, had his spine' injured. Gus "Web
ber, aged 16, a riveter at the Union Iror
Works, was bruised about the hips anc
legs. After temporary treatment the in
jured were removed to the Railroad Hos
pital. Traffic was delayed for some tiim
as the cars were badly demolished. ;
Admiral, General and Judge are the
names selected by Mrs. Roosevelt for the
President's three new carriage horses,
magnificent Kentucky thoroughbred trot
ters with fine long- tails. Admiral and
General are to be driven as a team, and
velvet calling grown and big white hat
with a white plume. There is nothing
harder to wear than a velvet gown, but
MiÂ«s McKinstry has the figure and- bear
ing that should go with it. I have met
her several places with her velvet gown
on and think she looks simply -regal in it.
Laura McKinstry always shows a de
cided preference for black gowns. I re
member seeing her last season, in a se
verely plain black silk gown, cut low and
sleeveless, . and with a long-stemmed
American Beauty rose pinned on the cor
sage. She looked simply stunning and
presented a picture I shall not soon forget,
get.
