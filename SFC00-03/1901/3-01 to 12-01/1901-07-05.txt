PATRIOTISM AND NOT
RIOT THE KEYNOTE OF
CENTURY'S FIRST FOURTH
Evening Exercises Breathe a Spirit of Pride
and Loyalty That Finds Ready Re
sponse in the Hearts of the Many
AKOTHER Fourth has come and
gone and in its passage it found
the people of the same min-i and
heart as always. It was not a
boisterous Fourth nor an excit
ing one, but all the inspiration
of the day was there, and that
after all counts for more than powder
smoke and street parades.
nags were well in evidence, and people
teemed satisfied with them; there was
not much attempt at ' other decoration.
Old Glory in all stages of newness and
repair reigned supreme, nor was other
decoration needed. There was wind
enough to lead each glittering ensign out
from its staff, there was sun enough to
light up its bars of red and white, and
its field of blue, and lend luster to its
stars, and there were bands enough to
fill the_-air with its own eone. It would
have been good enough had there been no
more.
The parade of the morning was of the
strictly military sort, and it tramped the
Game paving- stones that thousands of
paraders have pressed before, but It was
unaccompanied, by the crowd and the
cMeers that usually follow the brass but
tons and the bugle's note. It was not a
military Fourth.
During the afternoon bands discoursed
their music to the passing thousands that
gathered in the parks, on the lawns and
under the trees, and heard again thÂ©
tunes that find their fascination in being
so old and so very near to us.
In the evening fireworks rivaled the
Etars, but only for an hour, and while
they lasted the city was out watching.
Why a picture of Washington done in
sputtering- grunpowder is better than a
half-holiday is a problem, but it seems bo.
Why a small boy can find more fun in get
ting a reluctant firecracker even to fizz is
another problem, â¢which the boy himself
finds difficult. Why it Is that children of
larger growth find pleasure in throwing
chasers into a crowd, firing blanks from
a revolver or touching the punk to the
fuse to get some fiery shape or sound is
another question that the Fourth presents
every year and leaves unsolved; but it
â¢was not bo bad this year as It has been,
end, besides, there were all the good
points.
In the evening, too, was the patriotic
jjrogramme rendered before a crowd that
really came to listen and to enthuse. It
was an old-fashioned, spread-eagle, ful
minating affair* that brought a good at
mosphere with It and left the people that
came and heard better than they were be
fore and glad they had not missed it. It
nas a good Fourth In sentimentand in all
that makes a good Fourth, and not a
noisy one. It has started the century's
celebrations well and under a rising sun.
It could hardly have <lcne more.

Miss Nellie Waters then played several

Robert P. Troy Speaks.
The "Star Spangled Banner," sung byÂ»-
Miss Btta Welsh, was next, and when the
enthusiasm, that the gran<% old tune called
forth had subsided RobeA P. Troy, the
orator of the evening, took the platform
and spoke as follows:
"The historic - event that we celebrate
on this anniversary not only emancipated
the thirteen colonies from the moods and
exactions of an over-confident sovereign,
but it gave birth to an ideal republic, and
an expansive conception of industrial \
f reedom, undreamed of in the record of
ages that preceded it.
"The republic that sprang from the
ashes of the revolution was not a mere
Incident of chance, but it was a structure
that â¢was built in sight of the tragic
wrecks that lined the uncertain shore of
history, from the genesis of governmental
decline to the hour of '76. The intellect
and the arms that molded the stranger
Which knocked for recognition at the door
of the family of states was an inspired
force, if inspiration can be said to have
ever played a part in the complexities of
human Intercourse. The men behind the
guns were warriors and philosophers, the
Alexanders and the Aristotles of modern
times. In laying the foundation of the
American commonwealth \ they studied
every flaw' and every virtue of the powers
which flourished in that period ; arid of
those that had sunk into the oblivion of
decay. The product of their statesmanship
was therefore seasoned with the history
of the past and with their own lofty con
ceptions of liberty and 'justice. j ;
"In this bustling age of commercialism
we seem to forget the achievements of
the founders of the republic and there is
a touching absence of the reverent con
sideration of this auspicious hour that Is
due to the anniversary of our national
birth. The priceless jewel of patriotism
sparkles with the 'same vigor as of yore,
but the old ideals seem to be forgotten.
The first evidence that a new republic
appeared upon the stage of action is con
tained in the Declaration of Independ
ence, and the constitution of the United
States outlined . the . proportions .of that
creation. In the one is contained the
ethical sentiment that governs our morals;
In. the other Is measured the legal force
that limits our power.
Two Great Instruments.
"The constitution Is the ever . present
mentor that scrutinizes j our policies and
molds our laws. ] We 'cannot eo outside j
the pale of its limitations unless the peo
ple amend this instrument to permit the
desired departure. It has been amended
fifteen times and is suspectible of further
change as often as .the people may decree
innovation. But not so the Declaration
pf Independence; it cannot be amended.
Us precepts are irrevocable and It must
stand unaltered^ forever, j The Supreme
Court of the United States, the highest
judicial power in the land, has said that
the letter of the constitution can be read
only in the spirit of the Declaration of In
dependence, and this utterance estab
lishes the legal principle that all men are
created equal and that governments derive
their Just powers from the consent of the
governed.
"These two Instruments are the bul
warks that conserve our national entity,
the Declaration buttressed â¢ with- our his
tory and principles, the constitution the
depository of our law and limitations.
"The Revolutionary period was not with
out its scoffers, who questioned the effl
cacy of the theory of government outlined
In these two documents, and who opposed
it with tenacity and bitterness. This re
sistance was so strong when the consti
tution was submitted for adoption that
among its proponents, Madison, Hamilton
Â¦ and Jay, fearing these attacks, deemed it
necessary to publish . their rcholarly antf
unanswerable arguments in its defence un

WU TiNG FANG

Philadelphia Has One of the Host
Notable Celebrations in the
1 . East.
PHILADELPHIA, July 4.â Several thou
sand persons gathered in Independence
square to-day to hear Wu Ting Fang, the
Chinese Minister. Minister Wu was: the
orator of the clay at the municipal cele
bratfon of Independence day. arid the
friendly reception given the distinguished
guest must have allayed all fears lor his
safety, based on the fact that he ha 3 re
ceived an anonymous letter threatening
him with bodily harm.
Minister "Wu began with an expression
of his gratification at the honor shown
him and regret over the circumstances
which prevented his acceptance of a simi
lar invitation, a year ago. Referring to
the day, he sketched the many important
events which had occurred upon Its an
niversaries. He made humorous reference
to the fact that China furnished America
with firecrackers, and then in serious vein
traced a similarity in the educational sys
tem of China, which gave the humblest
citizen opportunity to become part of the
Government, and the electoral system of
the United States. He defined the canons
of Confucius and Meneiu's as the Magna
Charta of China and quoted the words o*
Mencius: "The. people are the most Im
portant element in a nation; the spirits of
the land and grain are the next; the sov
ereign is the lightest."
His closing tribute to the United States
was as follows:
Tliis nation, it seems to me, has spruni: Into
existence -with a manfest destiny. There
must be some notable ends for which the in
dependence of the United States was estab
lished.' It was to demonstrate to the world
what great good to mankind a free and inde
pendent people can do; to establish "a govern
ment of the people, by the* people and for tha
people;" to preserve law and order; to treat all
people alike, with fairness and justice; r.o do
away with clannish feeling: to make American
patriotism synonymous with fair play, with
the4ove of mankind, with freedom and literty,
with law and justice. By pursuing , these ends
this republic will become the greatest power
upon the earth, and you citizens' of this ureat
country will be more than ever respected and
loved by alL ;
NEW YORK. July. 4.â Tammany Hall
held- Its Â¦ regular j Independence day ' cele
bration, at which the Declaration oi In
dependence" was read and speeches were
made .by. Governor Jennings of, Florida
and other leaders of the Democratic- par
ty. The following letter of regret' from
W. J. Bryan, dated "Washington, June 29,
was read: : , .
I congratulate Tammany upon the fidelity It
has eh'own in celebrating- each returning- an
niversary Of the Signing of the Declaration of
Independence. I trust that at this time, when
the Republican leaders are denying the uni
versal application of the self-evident truths
set forth in the Declaration, special emphasis
will be given to the assertion that governments
derive their just powers from the consent of
the governed. In response to your request for
a sentiment appropriate for the occasion, 1 btg
to suggest the following: "Liberty is not sale
without a written constitution, and a constitu
tion to be of value must be strong enough V>
control every public servant and broad enough
to Include within Its protection every person
who acknowledges allegiance to the flag."

In Washington and Columbia Squares

vacancies. Some organizations
turned out woefully short and the parade
reports will bring trouble for more than
one captain unless they all go through in a

The column was headed by a company
of police under Lieutenant Birdsall, and
there vras nothing in the column behind

Bright Auguries of Future.
tor In our affairs will In the future con
tinue to germinate without colonies as it
has developed without them in the past,
and I will repeat to you what has been
said on a former occasion In this con
nection: What -flag has our- commerce
had to follow In its marvelous growth.
You know its importance: you have scan
ned the statistics and through them you
have seen It swell. "We know that it has
swept" aside every barrier that our rivals
have raised to bar its progress: we know
it has penetrated the capitals of our keen
est competitors; we, know it has invaded
the realms â¢ over which they have cast
their sovereignty; we know that as others
have expanded in empire its resistless in
fluence has broadened with the tide; we
knew it- has outstepped them all in the
contest for commercial supremacy with
out a flag to follow and hardly a ship to
call Its own. Trade does not follow the
flag; it follows a superior article; It fol
lows honest dealing; it follows low prices;
it follows inventive genius; it follows
American enterprise; it follows supply
and demand. '
"But this is a mere theory, and what
ever the correct solution may be it can
have little influence on the question, as
we have taken possession of the new
territory and 'our Supreme Court has set
tled the legality of the enterprise by de
claring it to be constitutional. Â¦
"This means that our standard will float
in Oriental citadels and that the atmo
sphere of American liberty will j implant
the ideals that we cherish upon the soil
that rejected, the flat of Spanish tyranny.
It behooves us in framing the Govern
ment which must be observed in this dis
tant'but no longer foreign clime, to have
ax;are lest the errors that have beset eth
ers creep into our dominancy. We must
remember that the truths 'all men are
created equal' and 'governments derive
their power; from the consent of the gov
erned' are vibrating around the hearth
stones of the Filipino with the same en
ergy that they animated the men of '76.
The lessons of misrule that have been
taught by governmental masters litter the
pages of history. The Persian monarch
and the Roman conqueror have attracted
the emulation of modern rulers when their
awful tyranny should have served as a
dread warning of the implacable intoxica
tion of unbridled power.

THE eloop Alert won the annual
race of the California Tacht Club
yesterday' for the Wallace trophy,
beating the holder, E. F. Sagar's
sloop Edna, by the narrow mar
gin of 1 minute 34 Seconds, cor*
rected time. The only other com
petitor was John T. Carrier's sloop Jessie
E, Commodore S.^ S. Marshall's sloop
Thelma being at present on a cruise to
Napa City and the sloop Pactolus hav
ing returned from an up-river cruise only
last Sunday. One o'clock in the after T
noon was the , time appointed for the
start, but the sloop Alert not being able
to get to the narrow gauge mole at that
time, it was decided to postpone the start
for half an hour. The course was out to
Presidio Shoal buoy, rounding It on the
port hand, and back to the southerly pier
head of the narrow gauge mole.
The wind was light at starting 1 , but
freshened in the channel, though at no
time ' was it a stiff breeze. The three
! boats made a pretty start, crossing the
'line within twenty seconds. The winner
made the quickest time over the course,
but, having to give an allowance to each
of the other two boats, won by only a
narrow margin. Yesterday's race is the'
only race for the Wallace trophy that the
sloop Edna has failed to win since -the
institution of the annual contest for that
cup, except one, when she was beaten by
the late A. E. von Schmidt's cutter Whirl
wind.
SAN FRANCISCO'S first open-air
fights, held yesterday at the
Sixteenth and Folsom streets
grounds, drew a big 1 attendance,
the greater part of which was
perched in the bleacher section.
And the crowd, as big as it was,
Â¦went from the grounds Â¦with disappoint
ment, big and sure, as its pugilistic holi
day portion. The fight that was of popu
lar interest and that was counted on by
iho management to make the money did
:iot last three rounds. Again Jack Mof
fatt threw his arm out, and by so doing
lost his fisht.
The Moffatt-Gardner fight dp to the
time of the accident which ended it was
a very pretty listic performance, and gave
promise of producing: enough thrills and
palpitations to satisfy the fight-thirsty
crowd. Both men tackled their worjt
eagerly and earnestly. Smooth sailing
Â¦was the order of the day, when suddenly,
after a clinch. Moffatt dropped on his
knees, clutched his left arm, and, as he
â¢winced with palrt, beckoned to the referee
to cesie to his assistance. Welch tried to
force the arm back into place, but with
out Fuccess. Moffatt was taken out of
The ring, and CJardner was declared the
ivinr.er.
Moffatt has been a singularly unlucky
fighter. Back in New York, when he
fought Gardner the first lime, the battle
vras eoing his way when, by the mis
chance of war, he broke his arm. Last
September in this city he dislocated his
arm, and Al Neill came to a decision on
ihat account that never would have been
his. This last accident will probably end
iloffatt's ring life.
What there was of the fight was good,
end gave signs of the ultimate color of
Gardner in the foreground. Gardner is
a tall, sinewy, rangy fighter, with a good
punch. In the first rcund he floored Mof
latt with a fast right on the head, and
Moffatt, although not in any way uncon
scious of the situation, took the full count
hefor.j returning to the fray. Both men
mixed things, courting rather than avoid
ing hearty, earnest work. But Gardner
landed oftener. and seemingly without
great trouble. Before the mishap occur
red neither fighter was in any way the
worse for wear.
The Sixteenth and Folsom streets
grounds, the scene of many a football
game and its concomitant and color-mad
excitement, looked a bit strange and un
usual yesterday. The ring In the center
and the boxes around it, then a waste of
sand, and farther back the bleachers with
a thickly packed crowd, made a novel
prize-fight gathering for this city. To
many it brought up recollections of the
Carson fight between " Fitzsimmons and
Corbett. Fighters In the glare of the
sunlight, men wiping from their heads
perspiration produced by the heat of the
Kun, are novelties at local prize fights.
Day fights will not be so unusual In the
future. The success of this first venture
almost assures another and a bigger one
for September 9.
Promptly upon the hourâ 2 o'clock â the
first preliminary was put upon the board.
It did not last longâ two rounds and a
fractionâ when Jack Welch told Willie
Snallham to go to his corner and beck
oned for the seconds of Willie Scholieln
to take their man out of the ring. Scho
beln was all .but out several times during
the second round, and was on his way
to temporary unconsciousness when
Welch proclaimed Snallham the winner.
The Thurston-Nelll fight, which Jack
Welch called a draw, showed Thurston In
very poor fighting form and Xeill without
strength. Nelll hit Thurston almost at
Â¦will during the last half of the fight. In
fact Thurston, without boxing rhyme or
reason, ran Into everything. Instead of
showing improvement, he displayed the
reverse. For a time In the early rounds
after the fight had got under way Thurs
ton, by vigorous and equally awkward
work, landed successfully and continu
ously on Nelll's body. But this stopped,
and then Nelll punched and punched and
punched away at Thurston. who was in a
nea of fighting ignorance all the time. He
would throw out his arm and occasionally
land, but his blows were of the spread
eagle sort, without any seeming force or
power. Nelll had the best of the fight
clearly. Thurston showing signs of weak
ness in many Instances. For the matter
cf that Nelll himself was physically used
up. although he kept on fighting under
the semblance of strength. The decision
â¢was not well received.
1 After the fights AI Smith representing
Root and Alex Greggains representing
Gardner discussed a match between these
two men. There Is every likelihood that
It Â¦will' be arranged: also another match
between Nelll and Thurston. -

NEVER in the history of SchueJA
zen Park has a more patriotic
crowd filled its confines than
that which made merry under
the trees yesterday. It was the
occasion of a reunlor-, excursion
and picnic of the Ancient
Order of Hibernians and fully 10,000
members and friends of the organiza
tion were present. The day was ideal for
the outing and the arrangements so_com
plete that nothing occurred to mar the
'pleasure of the picnickers.
The railroad company was placed in a
quandary as to how to handle the vast
crowd. ..More than sixty cars were prey
ed into service and still more were need
ed., Every train brought hundreds, and
early in the afternoon the grounds were
crowded with merrymakers. The pavilion
was constantly filled with dancers. An ex
cellent band discoursed popular music
throughout the day and hundreds tripped
the light fantastic to its pleasing strains. '
At 1 o'clock a patriotic programme was
presented In the open air. The orchestra
played an overture appropriate to the oc
casion and at the conclusion of the selec
tion J. J. Donohue, county president of the
order, delivered an introductory address.
The Declaration of Independence was read
and aroused great enthusiasm. J; M. Mil
ler read an original poem that sparkled
with Irish gems and breathed the fire of
patriotism. Then followed an oration by
Stephen V. Costello. Ihe speaker was in
good voice and his remarks aroused great
applause. Â¦ He j>aid a high tribute to the
Irish heroes and martyrs and aa he men
tioned the names of Parnell, â¢ Grattan,
Wolfe Tone, O'Conr.ell and others the-en
thusiasm was Intense. He dwelt at length
on the part Irishmen took in framing the
laws of the country; how they fought for
America's independence and how they bled
on many fields of battle that this country
might live. - The j orator was interrupted
timeand again by applause. .The. singing,
of the national anthem by. the vast crowd
concluded the exercises. V .., . .
The games on_the tfack were a great
feature of the' day. The committee,
consisting of T. P. O'Dowd, chair
man; P. Lynch, Judge; M. Lennord, M.
H. .McCafferty, Ed Nunan, T. L. Clancy,

as they had never been conducted before
and won great praise for its efficient and
satisfactory work. The , contestants had
plenty of room In which to compete and
the ' events were pulled off quickly and
without a hitch, showing perfect arrange
ments. There was a great deaKof cheer

players happy, for )when the final flag
was raised the short ends that had broken
the monotony for the pikers numbered
an even half-dozen. The odds, too, wera
close, averaging as good as 2 to L
McComb's old-time champion Royal
Flush came near to adding the stake to
his credit. In the first round, with Green
hall as his opponent. Flush surprised the
wise ones a bit by getting the Bag. al
though the odds were 5 to 3 against his
chances. Jingle Bells was next disposed
of, and then the old campaigner won a
long one from Silver Cloud. NA. fast hare
was turned loose for the pair. He took
his pursuers a hard route, and kept them
from getting too close. The relief dogs
were given their only opportunity during
the day to join in a chase, but could!
only make the jack extend itself the more.
After a long run the hare escaped.
Flush was down in the next course for a
bye, and went against Cash. Tfcough he
was led by his opponent, Flush came in for
the kill. This left him In fourth place,
and he was withdrawn.
Anchor showed in great form, and al
lowed but few points to his opponents.
H dy l Glenkirk, Bona Fide and Warship
failed to score against him.
In the deciding course Anchcr closed
favorite over the clever Little !31ster at
slight odds. At the opening the dogs were
played at even money, but at alfp time
the Anchor men were compelled to give a
point.
SOCIETY whiled away the Fourth
under the broiling sun watching
gentlemen jockeys ' "wind" their
ponies on the Hobart estate track
â¢ at San Mateo. Society wa3 much
pleased. It rode with the gentle
men jockeys and raced with the
lathering ponies In spirit, but had no ap
plause for the victors.
Only once was this gathering overcome
with excitement. It was when Willis
Polk's pinto mount demonstrated that it
was master of its rider. Mr. Polk went
out to race with Mr. McAllister. He
finished when going the wrong way, hard
bumped against a fence. McAllister, led
this race through the stretch and made a
driving and victorious finish. Then Folk's
pony demonstrated his chagrin. He kept
on going and when half around the track
turned and came sailing back with Polk
still aboard.
As Polk and mount passed the stand on
the hurried return a babel of advice was
hurled at the rider, but he heeded it not.
His mind was concentrated on the labor
of holding on. At the stable gate Mr. Polk
changed his mind. He decided to get off.
The pony decided to help him and broad
side on Mr. Polk hit the fence with a re
sounding bang. Until it was learned that
Mr. Polk was still alive, uninjured, in fact
âat least he said soâ society was excited.
His final appearance, coupled with the
appearance of his opponent, who was
brought out on a hay cart to receive the
plaudits of those who had plaudits to gl\|?
dispelled the momentary excitement arid*
society settled down again to silently ei
joy the coming events.
Mr. Polk's effort was not the gauge by
which the talent of the gentlemen Jockevg
may be judged, however. F. J. Carolan
went twice under the wire aheadâ or at
least under where the wire ought to be
by making driving finishes that would win
him fame among professionals. The Â«juur
ter-mile dash, which he won by a neck
K after "taking to the bat" was as exolting
as any old sport could desire. Walter Ho
bart also demonstrated his ability at* a
"pony pilot" and Charles I>unphy added
to his laurels by swinging both Hobart
and Carolan in the dust behind him.
From miles around the country people
gathered to watch the races and view so
ciety. Society also gathered- to watch thÂ«
races and view itself. Coaches and drags
lined the course and mingled with the
farmers' vehicles where, on cleated
boards, father and mother, brother and
sister, cousins, other relatives and the
hired man sat and passed the day. Silks
and jewels were relieved against back
grounds of homespun and coral.
Following are the events, the names of
the victors and those who came behind:

Dunphy on Lady Betty, F. J. Carolan second,

The feature of the day's racing was the
relay race. W. Johnson, Cyril "robin and
Walter Hobart went on the track
against F. J. Carolan, Fred Poett and T
A. Driscoll. Johnson led Carolan the first
eighth of a mile, passed the glove he car
ried to Cyril Tobin, who in turn passed
the same to Walter. Hobart, who, owln-*
to the difficulty experienced by their op
ponents in passing the glove, secured a
quarter of a mile start over Driscoll. Ho
bart generously slowed up, however," per
mitting Driscoll to close up the gap and
then 'made a close and easy, finish, Ho
bart crossing the line but a length in the
lead. - â¢ - â¢ -

The results of the heats to-day were:
It is generally agreed that the race to
morrow between the Leanders and the
crew from the University of Pennsylva
nia will be a close and exciting one. The
Americans are feeling very confident and
say that they will be rowing all the time
no matter what be the tactics of their
opponents.
General Results of Heats.
A .curious contrast tÂ° the solemn aloof
ness of the Pennsylvanias, who have never
seen anything- of the regatta, is that Leander
rowed four of their men from the eight in the
stewards' race and that Payne and Burnell
were to have had a third time at 6 o'clock
against the Belgian pair, but were scratched
No better contrast could be suggested of the
way in" which English and American oarsmen
gain their experience and training. The first
race they see all they can and do all they can.
The second they row. against the watch. We
sha)I see the , result . to-morrow. Â¦
The Leanders improved on their previous
performance and their improvement, has not
finished yet. . But far more important is the
fapt that to-day the Englishmen reached
Fawley no less than six seconds faster than
Pennsylvania and when the two meet each
other there will not be that difference, be
cause the Leanders never get farther ahead
than they can help. The difference in pace
necessitated for the Pennsylvanians will have
a very serious effect upon the middle half
mile, which has hitherto been such an easy
thing for them. . , â¢ .
The Leanders Are Improving.
Socn after this, as the Thames men were
completely out of the hunt, the Pennsyl,
vanlans settled into that lively paddle, at half
steam, at thirty-six strokes, for whictf they
are so famous. It is extremely useful to
nurse a crew which has established a good
lead and save up its powers until they are
wanted again. But it has .now been seen
in these races for the last time. V/hen near
the Leander lawn and about a quarter of a
mile from home the crew got far more lively,
though they did not row as long as they
should have done, and when they quickened
to forty-one in order to beat the already
beaten crew by a little further distance, they
were by no means rowing as neatly as yester
day and their completed course was timed at
only seven minutes and twenty-two seconds
I attach very, little Importance to time test
comparisons as a general rule and shalf not
emphasize the fact that, the Leander cre-v did
twelve seconds better overfall just before, be
cause the Belgians were a much faster crew
than the Thames. ; . * . .
When Umpire Pitman gave the Word "Go!"
the 1 ennsyivanians leaped forward to their
work with square blades and tore out half a
dozen strokes before the Thames crew had fln
shed four. They E ot. forty-one full strokes
into the first minute, though these were far
from neat, for there was much splashing.
This, however, made no difference, for the
I hames crew could row only thirty-nine, and
having lost three-quarters of a length by the
time the Island was passed. The Pennsyl
vania na continued at full steam, going farther
and farther away from their weak adversaries
They reached half way In three minutes and
forty seconds, a time which deserves earelul
remembrance.
Theodore Cook, the well-known Oxford'
oarsman, Â¦ writing on -to-day's Henley
races says:': Â¦' â¢ , .
Opinion of a Nqted Oarsman.
The . Leander-Belgian race was a hard
one, but not s-j severe as expected. The
Leanders got away with surprising rapid
ity at the rate of forty-three, and secured
a. bare lengths lead ?it the tQP of the
island. The Belgians soon struck a rapid
gait and began tc come ud, but they could
"oj.ratch the Loanders. Off Fav/ley Cgurt.
which they did in. 3:24, the Leanders were
again clear. Off the Grosvenor Club the
Belgians spurtiM and nearly got'up level.
A splendid race home followed, the Lean
ders winning by a bare length- ;
HENLEY, July 4.â The second day of
the Henley regatta was signalized by an
other victory for the Americans, the oars
men from the University of Pennsylvania
defeating the Thames Rowing Club and
thus winning their second heat. As the
Leanders defeated the Belgian crew the
Pennsylvanians will meet -the Leanders
in the final heat for the grand challenge
cup to-morrow.
The conditions were even better than
yesterday. A bright, hot sun- was pruning
and there was no wind.
Boon after 11 o'clock the Leanders, pad
dling to the start for their race with the
Belgians, were loudly appiauded along the
course, but their reception was quite
eclipsed by that given to the Americans,'
who followed a few minutes later.
There .was only five minutes' difference .
between the two races, and no sooner had
Umpire Williams sent the Leandurs and
Belgians off than Umpire Pitman's
launch took its place to start the Amerir
pans and the Thames crew.
There was a capital start and the Penn
sylvanlans hal three-fourths of a length
lead before ths top of the island waa
reached. They rowed eleven strokes in
the first quarter, twenty-two In the Urst
half and rorty-cne during the first min
ute. The Americans went away ?teadl]y
and easjly from that point and dropped
their stroke to thirty-eight. Opposite the
Leander inclosure the Perinsylvaniana
were, three )ength3 ahead, and although
they again eased considerably and the
others spurted the Thames men were nev
er able to make up anything.
Passing the yrand stand the Americans
could not resist a little spurt, and they
rowed past with a dozen strokes at the
rate of forty-ona to the minute.
The Americans had a very, friendly re
ception. .Ellla Ward, the American coach,

rader brought up the rear. Going up the
back stretch the order was the same, but
as they neared the far turn Commando
moved ud to Handwork and they raced
head and head to the stretch.' At this
point Handwork gave It up and the crowd

THE rowing and swimming regatta
given on Lake Merritt yesterday
by the citizens of Oakland under

"Union was a signal success. The
day was ideal for regatta purposes, with

holders of the championship of 1900, and
the South End "Midgets." A. \V. Pape
retains the senior shell championship, and
George Baker won the senior skiff cham
pionship. The relay swimming race was
mpst exciting and was won by the Lur
line Swimming Club after a close struggle
with the Olympic team. The only'unsat
iafactory event was the junior shell race,
which was won by George Lewis, his sole
competitor being Harry Nelson of the
Alameda Club, who rowed in a skiff mere

NOTES OF THE GAME
IN SAN FRANCISCO
Umplre Graves made his bow. to the local
"fans" after an absence of some weeks.. His
"gigs" still need trimming, as his decisions on
balls and strikes were open to criticism.
Bowman bunted the ball along the third base
Una in the afternoon game and like a farmer
stood at the plate expecting the ball to roll
foul. Iburg . foiled him by. plucking it in the
nick of time and tagging Bowman out. The
crowd howled and one C. Rellly protested, but
to no avail. " â¢
Papst made a pickup in the first that created
a furor.
Both teams bunted well in the morning game.
The sacrifices were timely and good. -
When Los Angelea made its first run in the
afternoon the Southern enthusiasts made noise
but when the Dutch evened matters in the
fifth there was enough noise to be heard in
Oakland. ..
C. Beljly played a great game at third. His
namesake on the opposing team was also in
the game. . - , Â¦
"Chimmle der Whale" will be in the points

LOYAL PEOPLE
CELEBRATE IN
STATE CITIES
Frpra first to last the celebration was
pronounced the most elaborate and suc
cessful in the history of Livermore. The
fete was planned and carried out by the
following committees, appointed from
Company I:
The festivities closed with a military
ball at night and an electrical illumination
on the streets, substituted for fireworks
at the request of citizens who were mind
ful of the danger from f.res.
At n o'clock serious pursuits like racing
and dancing were cleared from the pro
gramme to give full sway to a procession
of "Horribles." which proved to be one of
the most pleasing exhibits of the day.
All the afternon the Fifth Regiment
band played concert pieces from a hotel
veranda on the main street.
Out of doors the soldier boys arranged
a sham battle, after which came games
and races on the public streets. The fire
companies gave an exhibition drill, and
there were bicycle and foot races over a
measured course, besides sack races and
other events over no course in particular.
A band of music in the armory soon set
tue young people tripping the mazes of a
dance. This feature of the celebration
lasted till late in the afternoon.
Thfe phieton of the Messrs. Stephen?,
dont in tTilliant red, attracted special at
tention and was awarded the prize offered
l>y ((he rranagement for the best decorated
conveyance.
Jfie Goddess of Liberty, personated by
Mils Daisy Barker, was greeted with
cheers all along the line of march. : The
forty-five tots representing their native
Sutos formed an attractive group.
After the parade there was an intermis
ptfin for lunch. At 1:30 p. m. the patriotic
liferary exercises w-ere held in the Farm

SAN JOSE, July 4.â Throughout Santa
Clara County, ! with the exception of this
city, the Fourth was celebrated with more
than usual pomp and noise. San Jose for
the first time in years had no celebration,
all efforts of her citizens having been
directed to the late rose carnival and re
ception to President McKInley. This gave
â¢the various towns of the county a chance
to celebrate. .Santa Clara, Saratoga, Los
Gatos, College Park, Gilroy, Mountain
View and Palo Alto all observed the day,
and .the citizens of the county attended.
San Joseans were well represented at all
the Placesâ in fact the Garden City fur
nished oratory for all the towns but Gil
roy.

Dr. W. G. Alban of Walla Walla.
Wash., says: "I find Herplcide all that
Is claimed for it as a dandruff cure. I.
shall prescribe it." Dandruff is a, germ
disease and you can't cure it unless -j-ou
kill the dandruff germ; and you can't do
that unless you use Newbro's Herpicido,
the only preparation in the world that de-
stroys the parasites. A delightful- hair

quested, among otht\ things, 'to faAor

The other chief objeils of the new Ram

has now nearly passe\ into a memory,
and free criticism evenbf the idols of the

Poor old Holy well street, in it3 day ine
of the most famous, not to say infaaxus,
streets in London, which is to be swfel
lowed up In the new avenue from Hbl
born to the Strand, is becoming a ite
jected and deserted lane. One of the mcfet
widely known and most respected boolc
folk, Mrs. Hindley. has put up her shut
ters for the last time. \
She belonged to the old Homes familr,
who were booksellers in Holywell street
in the most famous days. Mrs. Hindley' i
recollections of people under the vanA
ished conditions of trade are many anal
interesting. Her father did a great trade\
in three volume novels, and would often \
âso greatly has the trade alteredâ go
forth to the suburbs or the West End
with two or three such novels, to sell
them at libraries or. indeed, to anybody
he met who he knew was a likely custo
mer. In this way Mrs. Hindley has seen
the novels of Anthony Trollqpe. Miss
Braddon. Wilkle Collins, Disraeli and
many other writers distributed through
depression in trade, lack of money and
other causes when publishers have had
to put forth unusual exertions to push
likely books.
Strange have been the methods of ad
vertising. Only lately, for Instance, has
the sandwich board man been engaged fcr
advertising a novel. Formerly publi3her3
would have scorned such means of bring
ing books to the notice of the public, but
the latest takes the leading place of all.
Everybody suffers from the dropping fire
of trade circulars, yet never has been
seen anything so startling as a paper cir
culated the other day.
Imagine an official looking blue envelope
handed in at your door by a grave look
ing man of somber uniform, bearing the
words In very big black faced type,
"Final Notice." It gives the heart a.
jump and sets one wondering wha: bill
has been overlooked or what he hai been
summoned for. On opening it he finds
merely a circular from a firm of publish
ers announcing that after a certain; date
the price of some publications w!lU be
raised. Naturally, in disgust, he tears the
"Final Notice" to pieces. No; the "Filial
Notice" dodge will not make for the pop
ularity either, ot the advertiser or ot thÂ«s
works he may publish.

The Chinese Government pays us a high compli

made by Chinamen against European governments,
but it will have to pass with thanks, for up to date we

Turkey and consequently are in no condition to under
take a general collection agency. ,
To arguments of that kind it is not likely the oppo
nents of the Ministry can make an answer that will be
satisfactory to. the average voter, and consequently
Salisbury will not lack "support- in carrying on the
That statement does" not correspond to the facts so
far as they have been made known to the world, but it
served Salisbury.as a sort of basis upon which to build
up his appeal. His argument", is that the empire has
been assailed and that the British are fighting not
for conquest, but for the preservation of their terri
tory. Thus he went on to say: "Unless we now ful
fill the professions that have been constantly held and
determinedly made, we shall expose every part of our
dominions to those who have hated us and have
ceased to fear us." .Pressing the point .further he
added: "If you allow the belief to arise that you are
unable or unwilling to defend your own territory you
will soon find you have no territory to defend."
In speaking of the causes that led up to the war,
he said: "We are defending the King's territory
against invasion by neighbors who, in international
law, had no complaint against us and who were actu
ated merely by a greed for territory and the desire of
enlarging their dominions. That was the motive that
stimulated them. The motive that ought to actuate us
is a determination to defend to the utmost the rights
of the King and the sanctity of our frontier."
LORD SALISBURY'S WARNING.
BY way of reply to the opponents of the war in
South Africa, Lord Salisbury has recently de
clared that the empire cannot turn back; that
the war was forced upon his Government by the Boers
and that now to abandon the struggle or to make any
compromise would virtually mean a surrender of em
pire itself.
Ex-Senator Chandler of the Spanish Claims Com
mission is reported to have said recently that "tte
cause of the destruction of the Maine is an open
question." It will be^-seen that in his new office the
former Senator has attained a "very judicial frame of
mind, and will not decide upon anything until he has
heard further argument.

Grand.
Milton McWhorter, a prominent oil man
of Bakersfield, is staying at the Grand.
J. B. Bo wen, a irominent attorney of
Los Angeles, is a guest at the Occidental.
T. H. Lawrence, a mining man of Den
ver, arrived here, yesterday and is at the
Occidental.
Frank Carr, accompanied by his wife,
left yesterday for a two weeks' visit to
Anderson Springs.
George F. Ellis, a prominent mining man
who resides at Santa Barbara, is at the
Lick for a few days.
"A. M. McDonald, superintendent of the
Rawhide mine at Jamestown, is In the
city on business and is staying at the
Lick. .
G. Pacheco. one of the most prominent
horse breeders in the State and an exten
sive landowner of Ignaclo, is a guest at
the Grand.
W.L. Carter, a well-known merchant of
Santa Rosa, accompanied by his wife, ar
rived in the city yesterday. They are
staying at the Occidental.
Harry Brennan and his bride left on the
overland last evening for an extended tour
of the East. They intend making stops at
Denver, Chicago, Niagara, the Buffalo
Exposition, New York, Boston, Washing
ton and other cities. They expect to be
gone about two months.
There should be no long delay in getting the sys
tem installed. The feasibility of the new telegraphy is
no longer a matter of doubt. It was in this city that
its availability for dispatching news was first demon
strated by the success of The Call in obtaining a re
port of the arrival of the transport bringing home the
California Volunteers. That being so, this city cer
tainly should not be the last to have the system estab
lished as a permanent part of the Government service.
This is but another of the many proofs of the effi
ciency of the wireless service, and it is therefore grat
ifying to recall that the. Weather Bureau has been au
thorized by. Secretary Wilson to install a wireless ser
vice between this city and the Farallones. Even from
that point important information can be sent to the
city, but when the shipping of the Pacific Ocean is
supplied with the telegraphic apparatus and vessels
can send messages to the city from 200 miles or more
at sea, it will be possible for the Weather Bureau to
make much more thorough studies of the weather
and more accurate forecasts of the movements of
storms and winds.
A new illustration, of the increasing utility of the
service is furnished in the reports from Toronto of
the successful operation of wireless telegraphy between
points 300 miles distant. The dispatch was sent from
the steamer Lake Champlain and announced that she
wouid pass Cape Ray at a given time. It is said the
message was easily read at the cape, and from there
was 2t once sent to the company's offices at Montreal
and Toronto. It is added that the Marconi system
was used and that the success of the experiment will
confirm the Dominion Government in its purpose to
extend a wireless telegraph system along the coasts
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, the Bay of Fundy
and the Gulf of St Lawrence. Finally it is stated that
after leaving Great Britain the steamer sent a message
to the shore when 200 miles at sea.
DISPATCHING reports by wireless telegraphy
is no longer a matter of marvel or even of any
particular note. Such methods of sending news
have now become among the commonplaces of the
day, and it is only when some extraordinary feature is
associated with the event that it is thought worth
while to give it place among important items of news.
It happens, however, that such extraordinary things
are by no means infrequent, for while it is true that
in the rapid advance of wireless telegraphy that which
was wonderful yesterday is but an ordinary affair to
day, yet that same advance carries the art forward so
that what was an ideal to be hoped for on one day be
comes the unexpected reality of another.

Pauline or other fragrant roses. Place
these in a- fancy jar, add some cloves and
cinnamon and a little alcohol, just enough
to moisten the ieaves; then place the jar
for a time in the sun, where it may be
come warm, but not hot. The cover must
be kept on while- in the sun. After that
Â¦when the cover Is removed a most de
lightful fragrance Is emitted from the jar.

The Mail should not generalize from insufficient
data, and because it finds restricted grazing harmless
in private forests, conclude that unrestricted grazing
would be harmless in public forests.
Contrast this with the timbered States of this coun
try. "Where are the valuable hardwood forests of
Central New York? Cleared off and burned in log
heaps to make indifferent farm land. Where' are the
beech, maple, oak, black walnut and catalpa forests
of Indiana? Girdled and burned to get land that
raises fifteen bushels of corn to the acre, and is soon
surrendered to the rag weed. Ax and fire, have
stripped Michigan, Wisconsin an* Minnesota of their
forests, and much of the potential wealth of those
States has .disappeared with the timber. Yet if wisely
managed every acre of original forest land could to
day be producing a crop of timber.
Bavaria has been caring for her forests a full cen
tury, 'and now has more, larger and better timber than
she had a hundred years ago, and her timber har
vest, for economic use, has increased every year. She
cuts more and has more to cut annually than when
she began.
. All of the countries of Continental Europe have
suffered from the loss or impairment of their forests.
They are now at great qost saving what is left and
renewing what was lost. They have discovered the
rule to be that where nature plants forests the land
is more valuable for forest than for anything else.
Therefore, regarding the production of timber as its
noblest use, they are taking care of such land.
Small countries like Bavaria, feeling the pinch
hardest, began this care of forests earlier than the.
large nations. "~
Observation of conditions in our country and the
experience of other countries should convince any
one that the destruction of forests unfavorably
affects climate and fertility, and that grazing is a
means of such destruction, unless strictly regulated
and limited.
Those who know the past history of our forest re
serves know that as the flocks of sheep came out of
the mountains they left a line of fire behind them.
The herders deliberately destroyed the forest to make
open space for the next season's grass. Since these
forests were reserved and the sheep were kept out
these annual fires have not occurred. It is true that
the Government does not do its full duty by merely
excluding stock from the reservations. It should em
ploy foresters and workmen under their supervision
to keep the forest floor clear of dead timber and duff.
It should permit, when conditions favor it, restricted
grazing, under regulations sternly enforced. It should
also permit the harvesting of all ripe timber under such
circumstances as not to disturb the unripe or destroy
theoncoming crop. All. this will come in time, and
the reservations will pay the cost of their administra
tion and yield a revenue besides, and future genera
tions \vill v find upon them more and better timber
than they carry now. But if they are grazed now
without restriction they will, go the way of all for
ests that have been' used as open pasture.
The mountains of Spain were stripped ortheir tim
ber by sheep. Their moisture was diminished, the
plains and valleys were made arid, the rivers \ver4
made useless, and Spain was made poor by sheep.
After sheep and goats had wiped out the forests of
Austria overlooking the Adriatic, and that country be
gan'the slow process of replanting the denuded terri
tory, it was found necessary to use soldiers to keep
out the sheep and goats. Reforesting and grazing
could not go on together. .
The unrestricted grazing of any forest by sheep is
injurious. Especially is this so in an arid country, or
one that has a definite wet and dry season. The Mail
is proud of the acquaintance of timber tracts in our
California mountains that are leased for sheep graz
ing, and boasts of their good condition. We do not
doubt this, but that is restricted grazing of the land,
under such rules and regulations as the owner pre
scribes. The destructive- grazing of forests on the
public domain is quite another thing, for that, domain,
being free to all comers, its use is unrestricted.
Experience in forestry has demonstrated Â¦. that no
hard and fast" rule can be made about the grazing of
forests. The effect depends upon climate, local situa
tion, acclivity and many other conditions that must
be known before rules can be made. In some situ
ations it is useful to forests to run swine in them. .In
others, where the acclivity is great,- swine only
loosen the earth by rooting and prepare it to be
washed away, by the rains. In this way hillside forests
have been killed as effectually as by fire through the
washing away of the soil. '
FLOCKS AND FORESTS. '
THE Stockton Mail grows facetious about free
grazing of our mountain forests. It scouts the
idea that any harm ever results to forest land
from letting sheep run on it.
. At the Harvard commencement this year addresses
were made by Hoar, Roosevelt, the German Embas
sador (Holleben) and many other dignitaries, but it
was noted. that the' greatest impression upon the
alumni was made by the address of President Eliot,
in which he stated that Pierpont Morgan had agreed
to give the university $1,000,006. Money, it will be
seen, can make as good a talk in the academic groves
as in the market.
We believe that the principle contended for will be
found condemned by Chief Justice Marshall. The
Federal Government does not stop at a State line in
the imposition of the taxes necessary to its existence.
States prohibit the sale of liquor. The Federal Gov
ernment licenses its sale within their borders. They
may use their police power and the Federal Govern
ment does not interfere; its licensee takes the risk.
The Federal Government uses its taxing and borrow
ing power, and the States must keep hands off.
South Carolina will, of course, contend that the
imposition of a liquor license tax upon a liquor selling
State is a nullification of the State law. But the con
stitution, tieaties and acts of Congress are the supreme
law of the land.
Nor is this all. If a State, by embarking in business,
may snatch the objects dealt in from the Federal^tax
collector, every maritime State may become an im
porter and set up free trade, as far as the Federal Gov
ernment is concerned, and thereby destroy the power
of the .United States to enforce a tariff.
This raises some very, interesting issues. A French
financier said that alcohol, opium and tobacco offered
such a sure means of raising revenue that they should
never be lost sight of by statesmen. Our Government
made alcohol and tobacco subject to excise and license
and opium to a tariff during the Civil War, and these
impositions have been continued, because of the ease
with which that tax is collected, and the revenue needs
of the Government. South Carolina refuses to pay
for this license as a liquor seller and sues to recovor
what she has paid. If this contention is good the
States can destroy the Federal Government. . A neces
sity to the existence of that Government is its inde
pendent use of the power to tax and to borrow. Its
bonds are non-taxable by the States, because if the
States could tax them the Federal power to borrow
money would be destroyed, for the States could tax
that power to death. The United States taxes the
manufacture and sale of liquor. If a State can go into
the business of selling and evade the license tax, it can
also become a manufacturer and evade that tax. If
this be granted the power of the Federal Government
to raise revenue by a liquor tax is destroyed. The
States may then do the same with tobacco and remove
that from the objects of Federal taxation. This process
may be repeated with everything which the United
States may cover with an excise, and the Federal Gov
ernment may be driven entirely from' that field.
Now South Carolina is going into court with a new
form of nullification. Senator Tillman made his way to
the front in that State by advocating and securing a
Jaw which makes the State the only liquor seller. It is
called the State dispensary system. The State sets up
a liquor store where one is regarded as necessary, and
the bartender is a State officer or employe. The State
buys the liquor wholesale, retails it and pockets the
profits, if there be any. This law was attacked in the
Federal courts, but was upheld as a local police regula
tion proper for a State to make. But the United
States taxes liquor and compels a liquor dealer to take
out a Federal license. Without this license the liquor
in a dealer's possession is subject to seizure and confis
cation and the dealer to arrest and fine. South Caro
lina now seeks to nullify this law as far as she is con
cerned, contending that the Federal Government has
no power to exact a license from a State for the ..per
formance of any function of its sovereignty.
This at once identified nullification with disunion.
The attempt to stay in the Union and nullify its laws
was seen to be illogical, and the doctrine fell into dis
favor, to be substituted by th'e more logical though
not more constitutional theory of secession, which was
more logical because it taught a complete withdrawal
from the Unio.n.
Every one at the table realized that this speech was
a challenge to Jackson, and whenhe rose all saw that
the issue was joined. Raising a glass of wine, the
President gave the famous sentiment: "The Federal
Union; by the Eternal it must and shall be-.pre
served!"
THE SOUTH CAROLINA CASE.
ry OUTH CAROLINA is going into court with a
very interesting case. "It is one characteristic of
that original commonwealth.^ In 1832 that State
decided that the Federal constitution permitted a State
to nullify a Federal law, and therefore proceeded by
solemn ordinance to nullify, vacate and, as far as
South Carolina was concerned, to repeal a tariff. This
attempt gave rise to very interesting consequences
which have enriched our history. The South was quite
generally in sympathy with the movement, and, to
cement that section firmly together for the new policy,
a banquet was held in Washington City, with Galhoun
at one end of the table and President Jackson at the
other. Up to that time the course that Jackson would
take was not known. Calhoun made a speech to the
banqueters, in which he brought all his genius and
marvelous. power to bear in defense of nullification as
a constitutional doctrine and, to give it high authority,
pretended to trace it to Mr. Jefferson, then but a few
years dead. .. : /:â¢
war. There is, moreover, an element^ of indisputable
truth in the argument, although it starts from a wrong
premise. Great Britain is not fighting to resist the
aggressions of 'the "Boers, but none the less she is
fighting under the eyes of a -watchful .world, and fail
ure would greatly weaken her prestige' It is no vain
warning, that he uttered in the words: "We must
establish in the minds of the civilized world, especially
in 'South Africa, the conviction that if our frontiers*
are violated, it will be a bitter time for those who have
undertaken to do it. x It is only by inspiring such a
conviction -that you can be safe."

IN ARCHIPELAGO
Judge Taft Inaugurated
Civil Governor of
Philippines.
General Chaffee Also Suc
ceeds MacArthur in Com
mand of the Military.
MANILA, July 4.â Civil government in
the Philippines has been auspiciously in
augurated. Commissioner Taft was r
corted by General MacArthur and Gen
eral Chaffee from the palace 'to a great
temporary tribunal just outside the
Plaza Palacio. Standing in the center of
the tribunal Taft, the new civil Governor
of the Philippines, took the oath of of
fice, administered by Chief Justice Arel
lano, Governor Taft was then Intro
duced by General MacArthur, the guns -of
yFort Santiago being fired as a way of
salute. A feature of the Inaugural . ad
dress of Governor Taft was the announce
ment; that on September l, 1901, the com
mission would be increased by the ap
pointment of three native membersâ Dr.
Wardo Detavera, Denito Legarda and Jose
Luzuriaga, Before the 1st of September
departments will exist as follows, heads
having been arranged for thus:
Interiorâ Worcester.
Commerce and Policeâ Wright.
Justice and Finance â Ide. Â¦.
Public Instruction â Moses.
Provinces Not Pacified.
Of the twenty-seven provinces organ
ized Civil Governor Taft said the insur
rection still exists in five. This will cause
the continuance of the military govern
ment in these sections. Sixteen addi
tional provinces are reported without in
surrections, but as yet they have not
been organized. Four provinces are not
r^ady for civil government.
The speaker predicted that with the
concentration of troops into the larger
garrisons it would 'be necessary for the
people to assist the police, in the preser
vation of order. Fleet launches will be
procured, he said, which will Â¦ facilitate
collection among the provinces, as well
as aid the postal and revenue depart
ments. In connection with educational ef
forts Governor Taft said that adults
should be educated by an observation of
American methods. He said that there
was a reasonable hope that Congress
would provide a tariff suitable, one that
would assist in the development of the
Philippines, instead of an application of
the United States tariff.
According to the civil Governor there is
an unexpected balance in the Insular
treasury of 13,700,000, and an annual in
come of $10,000,000. He said that any pos
sible friction between civil and military
subordinates should be discouraged. ThÂ»
patriotism of the leading Filipinos was
commended. In conclusion Governor Taft
reiterated a hope expressed by the Presi
dent that in the future the inhabitants
would be grateful for the American Phil
ippine victories and that they would be
indissolubly linked in ties of affection with
the common country.
McKinley 's Message Cheered.
The reading of President McKInley's
message of congratulation was enthusi
astically cheered. The entire front of the
Tribunal, a block long, was decorated with
flags and several hundred officers, with
their families and friends, were seated
therein. General MacArthur, Governor
Taft and Military Governor Chaffee occu
pied the center, with the other generals on
their right, Rear Admiral Kempff and his
staff were on their left. The United States
Commissioners and Justices of the Su
preme Court were immediately in, the rear
with the foreign consuls. The mass of
the people stood in the park opposite.
The Filipino leaders were there, but there
were more Americans than Filipinos pres
ent.
The transfer of the military authority to
General ChafEee was carried out in the
presence of the generals, In General Mac-
Arthur's office. There was no formality.
General MacArthur presented the new
commander to the generals and remarked:
"I bequeath to you all my troubles."
All the high civil and army officers ac
companied General MacArthur to the river
front; where he formally embarked. Gov
ernor Taft and General Chaffee then re
turned to the palace and received the pub
lic.
SHOOTS AT A BAKER
FROM A DARK ALLEY
Unknown Person Attempts to Com-
mit Murder Late at ITiglit In
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, July 4.-Last night
shortly after 1 o'clock E. C. Hurth, a
baker employed at Ahrens' bakery, was
shot and dangerously wounded by a per
son he believes was Fred Hettlnger, an
other baker. Hurth claims the shooting
was the result of his refusal to join the
Bakers' Union. He says he left the bak
ery where he was employed about 12:45
last night on a bicycle. In returning he
passed an alley near the store. From this
alley a man stepped out and without a
word began firing at him. One bullet
struck him in the right leg, another in the
left leg close to the groin and the third
inflicted a flesh wound in the left thigh.
Fred Hettinger called at police head
quarterB In this city last night to explain
that he has not been in Los Angeles for
three months, and consequently could not
be guilty of shooting Hurth. He declared
that he came from Sacramento last'Sat
urday.

VANCOUVER, B. C, July 4.â M. Pich
on, French Minister to China, arrived here
from the Orient by the Empress of India.
He is accompanied by Mme. Pichon. They
will spend the summer in France. M.
Pichon had little -to say on international
questions. He agreed that the trip of
Count von Waldersee to Japan would do
a great deal of good. He considers that
the troubles in China are over for a long
time at least . .

Mrs. Genevieve Watson Baker, president
of the Native Daughters of the Golden
West, in delivering the address of the
day took for her subject "The Order of
Native Daughters." She traced the his
tory of the organization from its Incep
tion and described the. work which it has
already undertaken and that which it will
undertake in the future. The Declaration
of Independence was read by Louis F.
Byington of Niantic Parlor No. 105. Miss
Katherine Black sang tho "Star-spangled
Banner" and was encored. - An original
poem was read by Alfred Dalton.

That patriotic beneficial organization,
the Improved Order of Red Men, repre
sented by the tribes and the councils of
the Degree of Pocahontas of San Francis
co, Oakland, Alameda and Elmhurst, cele
brated the Fourth yesterday by an out
ing and picnic at Sunset Park; in the
Santa Cruz Mountains. It took two trains
of fifteen cars each to convey the 2400
who left this city* and Alameda County
for the shades in the canyon where the
park is located. "When the various , tribes
reached thÂ© terminus of thÂ© journey they
made known their arrival by a series of
warwhoops, startling the quiet farmers
of the vicinity, who were reassured, how
ever, when they learned that the "In
juns" were on pleasure, and not on de
struction, bent.
Immediately after hunger had been sat
isfied there was sounded the assembly,
which brought all to the pavilion, where
Emil Lastreto, the chief of games and
gata prizes, announced the winning num
bers of the gatÂ© awards, thereby making
happy 150 adults and eleven juveniles.
Races and games werÂ© started and con
tinued to a finish under the direction of
B. Lastreto, A. Jones, Frank - Pearson,
M. Bloom, TV. F. Kruger and C. de Cleer,
who was attired in thÂ© costumÂ© of an In
dian chief, and whose face was adorned
with war paint.
During the afternoon Past Great Sa
chem Harry A. Chase- presided at an elec
tion held for the purpose of determining
who was the most popular member of the
council of thÂ© Degree- of Pocahontas.
There were 553 votes cast. Miss Conroy,
Pocahontas of Rainona, was declared the
winner and awarded a pair of .$10 shoes
Misa Howalt of the same council was a
close second.
ThÂ© affair was a very pleasant and
most successful one, and much of this
was due to the individual efforts of P. S.
Seymour, E. Lastreto, J. Harry Hutaff
and H. A. Chase, officers of the general
committee, who admirably directed the
work of each, of the several sub-commit
tees.

iNHABITAHTS OF HEW POSSESSES CELEBRATE WITH MUCH ENTHUSIASM
GREAT FALLS. Mont., July 4.â The
three men who held up the Great Northern
transcontinental westbound express near
WÂ«gner, 19S miles west, yesterday, proba
bly will be captured before morning. Sher
iff Griffith, with a posse of twenty men,
has surrounded them at Buck Allen's
1 ranch, forty miles south of "Wagner, near
the edge of the old Fort Belknap reserva
tion on the west fork of the Houchetto
River.
The posse followed the "bandits all yes
terday afternoon, finding signs of them at
a ford on Beaver Creek and again where
they crossed the Dry Fork. ' .
Information that reached here late to
day is that the posse came in sight of the
men about 3 o'clock to-day, near the ranch
and, driving them in, surrounded them. It
is probable that they will not be captured
until after a severe fight, and at the latest
advices Sheriff Griffith had not made the
attack.
The bandits are thought to be barricaded
in the ranch buildings, which offered every
protection for a siege. The posse may
not try to force their capture until rein
forcements are received. It is understood
that another posse from south of the Mis
souri, in the direction of Fort Hawley, will
join Sheriff Griffith at Allen's ranch.
Identified by the Horses.
The Sheriff's posse has, not yet obtained
descriptions of the men, although Sheriff
Griffith was a passenger that was robbed
and saw the men escape across the plains
on their horses. The gang was identified
by their horses, and . when observed
through field glasses the white, bay and
buckskin on' which they were mounted
after toe robbery, were plainly seen. Con
trary to first reports, the men are not
experienced train robbers. Information
from Wagner and nearby points Is that
they have been partially identified as cow
punchers employed on a ranch lying south
of- the Milk River. One is a halfbreed, as
was thought at the time of the robbery.
He is known, to be the man who boarded
the express east of Wagner and forced the
engineer and fireman to bring it to a stop
at the head of the ravine in which his
confederates were hidden.
The authorities have been unable to
clearly identify the robbers, but it Is now
thought that with the information obtain
ed their previous records can easily be
ascertained.
Tracked Over Rough Ground.
The work of tracking was extremely dif
ficult, owing to the nature of the coun
try, bad lands, l^roken throughout by foot
hills and the eastern end of the Little
Rocky range. Across the line of the Fort
Belknap reservation, only a few miles dis
tant, there are excellent hiding places, and
it is thought that if the bandits should
evade capture to-night and once get in
this ground it would be almost Impossible
to find them.
Information received from Havre Is that
neither Traveling Auditor Douglass of
Clancey, Mont., nor Brakeman Whiteside
was hit in the fusillade from the bandits
at the time of the robbery.
Gertrude Smith of Tomah, "Wis., a pas
senger in thÂ© tourist car, who was shot in
the arm, was immediately attended by a
surgeon, who found that she had sustain
ed nothing more serious than a flesh
wound. This was treated and bandaged
and she continued her journey in com
pany with her aunt, to Seattle.
It is probable that the first estimate of
the lossâ $83,000â is somewhat exaggerated.
Reliable information received to-day was
$70,000, and that this with the damage to
through express shipments, resulting from
the explosions in the car, will represent
the entire loss to the company. No-in
formation concerning the consignees of
the money in the through safe is obtain
able. It is understood that a considerable
part was In the shape of shipments west
from Chicago banks and other financial
institutions.

GOVERNMENT EXHIBIT
AT EXPOSITION ROBBED
Daring Thief Steals Many Valuable
Stamps From the Postoffice .
Department.
BUFFALO, July 4.â Part of the Post
offlce I>epartment's exhibit of stamps waa
stolen from the Government building on
the Exposition grounds last night. A col
lection of uncanceled United States
stamps from the first issue to date occu
pied an important place in the exhibit.
The stamps .were shown in a pat
ent swinging case . containing leaves.
These leaves /are locked to tho
column on which they rest. This
collection contained some stamps of
great rarity and value; in fact, some were
borrowed from private collectors for this
exhibit. Although the .building is policed
by four officers, the thief ransacked this
collection last night and took stamps to
the value of ?4000. ' Apparently he appre
ciated the value of them, . as he took all
the rare ones and left some of the recent
issues. He wrenched two leaves from the
column where they were fastened and
went behind a group representing a mail
carrier in the Far West, aJid there robbed
them at his leisure. When the building
was opened this morning the loss was
discovered. Local and Exposition police
and secret service men are looking- for
the thief. Some of the stamps cannot be
replaced.

THE Fourth was very quietly cele
brated on the front. There was a
rush of picnickers at the ferr!e3
during the early morning, but
from 11 a. m. to 4 p. m. East
street was practically deserred. After
seeing that their ships weie properly doo
orated, the captains and as many of the
men who were given liberty' either went
uptown or across the bay. The Mail dock
transport wharf, Oceanic dock and the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
wharves were closed and no work was
done except what was made necessary ty
tbe arrival of a vessel.
The best showing on the front in the
matter of decorating was made at the
army transport wharf, -f'ae big "shed was
covered with bunting, while the trans
ports Grant and Buford. decked with siK
nal flags, added to the general effect. The
Thomas, at Harrison street wharf, the
Slocura at Folsom and the Logan in the
stream added to. the general effect and
easily made up the prettiest picture in the
bay. The Doric and San Jose made a
brave showing at the Mail dock, while the
KOsmos liners Hermonthis at Fremont
and Ammon at Lombard street wnarf
would have been a credit to any display.
Out in the stream the British ships John
Cook and Monkbarns. the German ship
Wandsbek, the collier Mineola and steam
ship Pomona, both coming in from nortli
ern ports, had all their flags set and,
joined with the gaily decked ferry steam
ers, made a lively water picture. The
steamer Enterprise at Mission street was
decorated in a handsome manner, while
the Asuncion, which arrived the same
day as the Enterprise from New York,
only flew the Stars and Stripes and her
house flag. The American ship Star of
Italy and the British ship Toxteth made a
struggle for first honors at the north end.
The Defiance was undoubtedly the best
decorated tug in the bay.
It seems strange, but it is nevertheless
true, that for every decorated American
ship in port there were five foreign vessels
decorated. The British and Germans mfidis
a splendid showing, but outside of the
transports the Americans did little. Of
course it is claimed that as soon as an
American ship docks the crew walks
ashore. That is no doubt true, but there
is always a captain, chief officer, watch
man and one or two men left, and surely
these for the honor of the glorious Fourth
could dress the ship in an emergency. It
seems odd, to say the least, to see
the American ship Henry Failing, that
arrived on the 2d inst.. with only the
Stars and Stripes flying, while a few yards
away a British ship had every mast
decked with bunting in honor of the day
which lost to England her greatest colony
and founded forever the United States of
America.
All of the State's wharfingers and col
lectors went on watch yesterday morning
at 6 o'clock and remained at their posts
until midnight. Many an incipient blnzij
was put out by them, while the State fire
tugs Governor Markham and Governor
Irwin made a half -dozen runs to alarms
for small blazes on the front.
NEARLY A COIiIilSTON.
Mineola and Geo. W. Elder Case to
Be Investigated.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company's steamship Geo. W. Klder
and the collier Mineola both arrived in
port yesterday. Before they get away an
investigation into a reported narrow.ps
cape from collision between the two ves
sels will be held by the Inspector of Hal's
and Boilers and the captains and officers
on the lookout x>n both vessels will be
given a chance to tell their stories.
The Mineola arrived early yesterday aft
er a good run of c-Ight-five hours from
Nanoimo. B. C, while the Geo. "W.
Elder came In a few hours later from
Portland after a fast run of fifty-eight
hours. It was on the previous trip of both
vessels, however, that the danger arose.
The Mineola waa on her way from Puget
Bound for Port Los Angeles with a load
of coal. When about 100 miles north of
San Francisco she met the Geo. x W.
Elder, bound for Portland. There was a
(â¢light fog, and the collier was running un
der easy steam, while the passenger boat
was making schedule time. Captain Kirk
wood of the Mineola asserts that a proper
lookout was not kept on the other vessel,
and that had it not been for the vigilance
of the men on the collier there would
have been a collision. The Mineola's en
gines were at once reversed, and warn
ing blasts blown on the siren. When the
vessels were less than fifty yards apart
the Elder's engines also were reversed,
and the two steamers sheered off. Further
than to say that there was absolutely no
danger, Captain Randall of the Elder re
fuses to talk. He Bays he will tell his
side of the story to the United States in
spectors, and that he has no fear of the
result. .
Royalist Arrives From Sydney.
The British steamer Royalist arrived
from Newcastle, N. S. W., yesterday after
a long passage of forty-one days. Quite
a number of times during the run she
had to stop because of small breakdowns
in the machinery. * These necessitated
running the vessel under a "slow bell" for
day3 at a time, and the passage was
lengthened considerably in consequence.
The Royalist went from here to Sydney,
N. S. W., with a cargo of general mer
chandise. The goods were wanted in Aus
tralia, and the regular steamers could not
handle the stuff, so the Royalist was
chartered to take It down. On her ar
rival in Sydney she was quickly discharg
ed, and then Â¦went to Newcastle, where
s=he loaded coal for San Francisco. After
an overhauling the chances are that the
Royalist will go back to Sydney with an
other general cargo.
S. P. Hitchcock's Smart Bun.
The American ship S. P. Hitchcock Is
now out nine days from Sydney, N. .S.
W. f for San Francisco, and . the many
friends of Captain Gates expect his ship
to make a record run. The Hitchcock
went from New York to Sydney in the
very fast time of ninety-seyen days, and
should she Â¦ come across in" anything- like
grood time she will equal the time for a
New York-San Francisco run in spite of
thirty-six days' lay in Sydney. / .
The original of the accompanying half
tone can be seen in Morris' art rooms on
Sutter street. It is by W..A. Coulter, The
Call's marine artist, and -was painted for
ex-District Attorney J. J. Dunn. The
Hitchcock was Mr. Dunn's home for many
a long month, and he wants the' painting
as a memento of his two trips around the
Horn.
Water Front Notes.
The steam schooner laqua sailed on her
maiden voyage, since being rebuilt, yes
terday. After being a few months in com
mission slie went on Duxbury Reef- one
evening soon after leaving San Francisco.
Later she was got off, but was so bad
ly damaged that her machinery had to
be taken out and. the hull practically re
built. Captain Gunderson went out in
command yesterday, and the steamer goes
back on the Eureka run.. Â¦. . ; ig
Among the passengers by the " "W. H.
Kruger from Fort Bragg yesterday was
Captain Thompsen of the Chehalis. â¢ The
latter vessel is laid up for repairs, so
the Captain went to Noyo to superintend
the loading of the steamer Horda 'with
railroad ties for Guayaquil. The job be
ing- finished, Captain Thompsen comes
home.

EARL RUSSELL
ASKS FOR TIME
A bold attempt at highway robbery was
made early yesterday morning,. James
Brodie, a crippled ex-soldier, and
Charles Kanan, his companion, being
the objects of attack. They were
walking along East street at about 2
o'clock in the morning, somewhat the
worse for liquor, and were stopped by
two footpads, who ordered them to throw
up their hands. Being v.-ell drilled and
disciplined, they obeyed orders, and the
robbers took f35 from Brodie's pocket and
ran away. . .
' The victims made a great outcry, 'and
gave chase, in which Detectives McMahon
and Holman took part, capturing the fugi
tive footpads in. a saloon in which they
had attempted to conceal themselves.
When taken to the City Prison the foot
pads gave their names as John Hurley
and William Hanley, and were recognezed
as old offenders. ..
- The prisoners were identified by the ex
soldiers, Brodie' having but a few min
utes before "loaned", a dollar to Hurley.
George W. Crook, late of Company B,
Forty-fourth Infantry, U. S. A., was in
a saloon at the. intersection of Kills and
Leavenworth streets jdrinklng early yes
terday morning, and, being apprehensive
of footpads, . took -five $20 pieces
out of his pocket and was In the
act of handing them to the bar
tender - for safe keeping when the
money was snatched from h'is hands by
Robert Burns. Burns dashed out of the
door and up the street with the five gold
pieces clutched tightly in his right hand,
closely pursued by Crook, who shouted
for the police as he ran.
The uproar was heard by Patrolman T.
Love, who overhauled Burns and captured
him, together with the money. Burns was
taken to the City Prison, and a charge
of grand larceny was booked against his
name.
Captured After Securing;
Booty From Ex-
Volunteers.
Other San Francisco Million
aires Likely to Follow
His Lead.
On the margin of beautiful Lake Tahoe
there will : 'probably be built in the near
future the summer residences of a whole
colony of San Francisco millionaires. The
first step, in this direction has already
been taken and the pidneer in the move
ment is I. W. Hellman, . president of the
Nevada -Bank and one of the most Â¦wide
ly known of the financial magnates of
California.- Mr. Hellman returned from
Tahoe x only . a few -weeks ago with his
family, and he came back charmed v/ith
the: lake and the country around there.
Moreover, he came back the owner of a
tract: of 200 acres of land on the margin
of the lake, which he purchased from M.
H. de Young. The land was bought at
a merely nominal price. It is wild, the
Â¦ only Improvement upon it being a small
wharf projecting into the lake.
The tract is on what is known as Sugar
Pine Point, half way between Tallac and
Tahoe City. The point projects far out
into the lake and the mountains are cov
ered to their tops with a heavy growth
of pine timber. Mr.. Hellman; who re
turned from Tahoe only to leave at once
for Catalina, where he is spending the
holiday season with his family, could not
be seen yesterday, but his son, I. W.
Hellman Jr., was. found at his summer
home in San Rafael and confirmed the
story of the purchase of land.
"It is the intention of my father," said
Mr. Hellman, ."to build a summer home
on the banks of lake Tahoe. He. knows
what he wants and is now having plans
drawn in accordance with his ideas- by
his architect, but as yet I cannot say
what the house will cost. That is not a
matter of great moment if he gets what
he wants. It is a beautiful site for a
villa' and the house will be fitted to the
site. Of course, it will cost a great deal
of money to make the place habitable at
all, as it is perfectly wild rrow. It will
be necessary, in fact, to install a plant for
the supply of water and an electric light
plant, and both these things will be done.
My. father will also set up a small steam
boat of his ; own on the lake. There is a
wharf already on the place â that being
about all there is excepting the rocks and
timber."
It is not likely that Mr. Hellman will
long be without neighbors when the beau
ties of his new summer home come to be
seen by other millionaires, and a colony
of the very, wealthy .on the margin of
the lake will in all probability be one. of
the developments of the next few years.

Sjwclal Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, July 4.â Between
300 and 400 Japanese are penned in a can
nery on tbfr Skeena River because .they
offered to fish sockeyes salmon at lower
prices than the rates . fixed by the union.
They were stopped by the Indians, who
stampeded them* back to the cannery as
they were just starting out to fish. The
Japanese were thoroughly Intimidated
and there Ms little possibility of there be
ing any further fishing done by them or
any one else until the price is fixed.
The. Indians refused some time ago to
fish at less than 12% cents, the price which
was settled by the white . fishermen's
union. Â¦ When It â¢ was reported that the
Japanese would probably undercut the
union the Indians declared that they
would look after them and stop them from
fishing. The Japanese took this simply
as a bluff, and on Sunday afternoon they
prepared to start out from the North Pa
cific and Standard canneries. Then the
Indians came down the river in their war
canoes, with ten men in each boat. They
encircled the Japanese, and the latter, be
coming terror stricken, made a dash for j
the shore. It took the Indians less than i
a quarter of an hour to round up tlte
whole bunch without a serious blow be
ing struck. Many of the Indians were in
war paint. ' "
The Japanese were finally all driven into
the cannery, Â¦where they had been kept
for some hours when word was brought

Wholesome Advice
For Peoph Whose Stomachs Are
Weak and Digestion Poop.
Dr. Harlar.dson. whose opinion In dis-
eases is worthy of attention, says when a
puu or woman comes to me complaining
Lf indigestion, loss of appetite, sour siom-
ach. belching, sour watery rising, head- \
athes. sleeplespness. lack of ambition and
a. general run down nervous condition I
(*4vise them to take after each meal one
c.r two of Stuarf? Dyspepsia Tablets, al-
lov.ing ihc tablet to dissolve in the mouth,
and thus mingle with the food eaten. The
refcuJt if that the food it* speedily digested
before It ha? time to sour and ferment.
These tablets will digest the food any- 1
v. ay. whether the stomach wants to or
not. because they contain harmless di-
e^stive principles, vegetable essences,
pepsin end Ciolden Seal, which supply
jiTst what the w*ak utomach lacks.
I have advised the tablets with great
success, both in curing indigestion and to
build up the tissues, increasing flesh in
Ihln. nc-rvous patients, whose real trouble
Â¦>v2s dyspepsia, and as soon as the stom-
ach was put to rights they did not know
what sickness was.
A fifty cent package of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets can be bought at any drug
store, and as they are not a secret"patent
medicine, they can be used as often as
desired, with full assurance that thev
contain nothing harmful in the slightest
degree; on the contrary, any one whose
stomach is ut all deranged will find great
benefit from the use of Stuart's Dvspepsia
Taolets They will cure any form of
Ftomach weakness or disease except can-
Cer cf the stomach.

SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. â¢ * 1OAKLAND, July 4.â The thou
n sands of people who assembled
at the High Schoo) court im-'
mediately after the parade
were more than well rewarded
for their .attendance upon the
literary exercises. In this, as
in . other features of the festlvltiei, the
committee had planned to give the public
a treat. And it was a treat, for the Rev.
Ernest E. Baker, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, delivered a ringing
oration, free from the ordinary spread
eagle Fourth of July platitudes.
The exercises were held from a large

The Sixth Division was In command of
Marshal O. T. Wilson and Aids E, J.

ing uniform of red coats and white trou-
The Fifth Division was composed of the
Woodmen of the World, under the com
mand of Marshal O. G. Hosslar and Aids
W. H. Robertson, John McKelvey and S.
H. Master. The Woodman band headed
this division, followed by several degree
teams in neat uniforms and a float rep
resenting the order.
J. H. Mullen was marshal of the Fourth
Division, which contained representation
from the unions of Oakland. .
The Third Division was composed of an
excellent showing of uniformed societies.
It was jn command of D. Ai Sinclair as
marshal and F. B. Pierce and C. F. Reu
ter as aids. The Patriarchs Militant sent a
battalion, composed of San Francisco Can
ton No. 5 under command of Captain
Corndyke and Oakland Canton No. 11, un
der command of Captain George Kirk,
the battalion being under the command of
Colonel C H. Weaver. There was a car
riage containing Brigadier Generals J. F,

The I. O. O. F. followed the Patriarchs in
their regalia.
Many Uniformed Societies.
The second division was composed of the
League of the Cross Cadets.
Lieutenant Colonel J. F. Hayes of the
Fifth Regiment of the National Guard
was marshal of the First Division. He
had for his aids Major J. A. Margo, E. H.
Pearce, Craigie Sharp and H. N. Gard. In
his division were the marines, the naval
apprentices and Companies A and F of the
Fifth Regiment, under command of Major
C. T. Poulter. Company A was in com

Captain' Bennett and Company A of the
Veteran Reserves of Captain C. K. King.
The military was followed by the car

with W. J. Blumberg- and Charles Gard

ments, even to the bloody bandage on the
old man's head, as it appears In the

curacy by the thrse OaKlanders.
The parade was headed by Chief of Po

The celebration was unio.ue' in one re
spectâit was a Fourth of July without a
Goddess of Liberty. This time-honored
feature was omitted entirely. Possibly it
was a wisdom that was born of experience
that caused this feature to be abandoned,
for. three years ago Oakland was rent in
twain ever the question ofvwho should
be Goddess of Liberty. Families and firms
were separated, and this year it was de
cided to have no Goddess, no floats with
thirteen girl? dressed to represent the
thirteen original States, no floats repre
senting Porto Rico, Hawaii and the Phil
ippines trying- to g-et under the Stars and
Etrjpes â in tact, just as little civilian dis
play as> possible and just as much military
as couid be had. .
And so it was that Oakland turned out
a parade that did not take hours to pass
any given point, but was just long- enough
fo that the people were glad to see the
countermarch. Every section of the par
ade had at least a military feature, even
to the Woodmen cf the World, who turned
out sr-veral degree teams, dressed in neat
and natty uniforms. The real military
was hard to get, for there are few com
panies at the Presidio. Congressman Met
calf got the famous Captain Meyer's com
pany of marines that is now stationed at
JIare Island after their experiences in
the siege of Peking, and a very interest
ing feature of the government display was -
the presence of a battalion of appren
tice beys fr^im the Naval Training School
en Goat Island. Ttiese boys came over
in their dark blue uniforms, under com
mand of the officers of the receiving ship
Pensacola. and made an Â¦ excellent im
prwrion. Their presence gave a good idea
to the public of the work that is being
done at thip new training- school that Is
to near Oakland and yet so little known.
League of Cross Prominent.
The largest single display was that of
the League of the Cross Cadets. The en
tire First Rejrimpnt of this organization,
composed' of fifteen companies, thirteen of
which were from Sun Francisco, turned
out under the command of Lieutenant/
Colonel D. J. McGloin. They broughw
their own band, a drum corps and a bugle
corps, and had fully COO in line, making
en excellent showing. An entire division
was given over to the League of the
<'rofs, with Daniel Crowley as marshal of
the division and Charles McDermott, M.
Flynn and D. J. Hallahan as his aids.
Colonel Power of the First Regiment is
f-ick. ro Lieutenant Colonel McGloin took
command, and marched at the head with
the regimental staff, composed of .Surgeon
Major Morxissey; Captain and Adjutant,
P. J. Haggerty; Captain and Inspector,
P-rnjamin McKinJey; Captain and Inspec
tor, J. F. Donohue; Captain and Inspec

But'the eniire day was a ereditable and
pieaeant one, tba,t ha,g p.reu^edÂ«the city
end created more pood feeling nmong the
public men and merchants than anytning
tlse that has taken plaoa ;n rn&ny years.
It was eo evidently a &zy &f gsoa feeling
that it has ieft e. p!ee.6Â£-n{ sensation be
hind that gives promise of more harmony
er.d more ot pulling together for the city
than has been the went of Oakland In the
days gone by.
While the arrangementÂ« for the day, as
made by the committees Jn charge, were
excellent, there was one feature over
vhich the Oaklanders had no control â the
weather. This feature was as attractive
as any of the day. The weather was per
fect. This- statement la generally used
with extravagance, but it can be applied
to the climatic condition* that existed in
Oakland to-day with abÂ£r-t5vite accuracy.
The day was bright, warm, and Avith a
trifle of breeze in the afternoon that
tempered the heat. It brought out duck
troueere and duck ekirts and bright colors
that added to the picturesqueness of the
day and made the crowds that thronged
the streets and the banks of Lake ller
Â»-ltt more comfortable and good natured.
A man does not seem to get drunk in
Â¦white trousers with the same facility that
he 4oes in dark ones. .
And fo it was that the thousands of peo
ple who turned out during the day to see
and be Eeen, and to help to add to the
noise and to dodge that made by others,
all declared that the Oakland Fourth of
July was a success.

A Grecian . philosopher laid It down as a
rule o* oratory to begin a discussion with an
incontrovertible proposition. Acting on this
s-uSKesticn from the past, J venture to sj.y
without fear of successful contradiction th.it
this Is the greatest Fourth of July ever cele
brated in this century. Being the first it cai
not help being the best, but it is the begin
ning of a long series of similar and grander
celebrations that shall follow through cen
turies yet unborn. America was spoken of as
"a Â¦ magnificent experiment" and Macau lay
referred "that experiment In democracy
called America to the twentieth century "
America is no longer an experiment and the
twentieth century proclaims her success and
accepts her present place as a permanent fac
tor In the affairs of nations. It Is my purposs
to review the Fast briefly, for the day la
charged with history, as well as noise, and
then to touch upon paesent problems to pre
dict the future that seems to be assurred.
Inspiration From Liberty Bell.
It was my good fortune to make frequent
pilgrimages to Independence Hall in Philadel
phia, where sat the Continental Congress a:i<l
where; the old liberty bell hangs, cracked as It
is. To visit those halls and to look upon that
bell, with Us Inscription, "Proclaim liberty
throughout all the land unto all the in
habitants thereof,", is to rouse the spirit of
patriotism, end in the lansrauge of Daniel
Â¦Webster to say, "Thank God I I am an Amer
ican."
From the reading of the Peclaration of In
dependence I trust that you noticed that lib
erty was declared to be an inalienable right of
man. That by nature they were free and
equal. That is an axiom in politics. A self
evident truth that needs only to be announced
to be demonstrated. Our forefathers there
fore did not become free that first Fourth of
July. Being free men, they became inde
pendent of oppression and this is rightly called
Independence day. Let me say in, this con
nection that what waÂ» a perfectly right prin
ciple of action 125 years ago may not be so
safe for to-day. I mean that it would be
suicide for a nation to maintain Independ
ence to the point of isolation. We are in tha
era of the brotherhod of man. which applied
internationally becomes the brotherhood of ra
tions. The solidarity of the race is accepted
as. true. The Englishman and the German
man and the Frenchman and the American
man have manhood in common. Hence the
need of international courts of arbitration,
as provided by the Peace . Conference, or. bit
ter still, a supreme court of nations, as si K
gested by Dr. Lyman Abbott, to which all
controverted questions between nations might
be referred for final adJsA^-atten.
Let America Spread Her Influence
Into this -wide world arena America has
been, led by the "Providence that shapes tur
ends, rough hew them as we may." It may
be that we have come of age as a nation. A
man attains his majority at 21. Perhaps a
nation . attains full stature and responsibility
Let "us awaken to the vision before us of
national opportunity. What is wanted is a
new enthusiasm kindled by the entrancing
view before us as we face the future this first
Fourth of July in the new century. The paet
of the day has srargested the annexation of
Canada and England. Why stop there? Why
not gro on to the annexation of the world,
which would be expansion with a vengeance?
Only let our hand be no hand of conquest or
oppression â not red with blood nor stained with
pelf. Let the hand of America be the hand of
help and education and commerce and civil
ization and evangelization, so that all the
world inspired by our presence may look up
and give all hail to America, the beneficent.

of America and said, that our problem would

OAKLAND, July 4.â The parade thjs
evening was without form. The crowd
came out to make a noise and have a Jolly
time without a set programme. The bulk
of the' evening show was on the sidewalks
and not in the; street. Everybody was
good-natured and enthusiastic and the en
thusiasm was contagious. Everything was
noisy, but within bounds.
The effort of the evening was unique. It

Several of the best machines of the
Oakland Fire Department closed the pa

The parade did one thing that was re
markable. It started on time, and Grand.
Marshal Arper kept It moving with few
stops until it disbanded. At the close the
literary exercises were held in the court
on the south side' of the High School.
Fourth of July Injuries.
OAKLAND, July 4.â The Fourth of July
casualties treated at the Receiving , Hos
pital were as follows:' ' Â¦> Â«
was proposed to have a parade of "Hor
ribles." The parade was late and rather
straggling when it did arrive, and con
sisted of two efforts to make fun. The
Elks turned out their famous. ballet that
made such a hit at their, minstrel show.
This ballet was draggles? a. take-off on a
Roman chariot with captives bound at the
wheels. Company' A of the Fifth Regi
ment'did a clever piece of work in a taker
off upon their return from Camp Gage. The
squad was dressed in the most remarkable
military costumes with a commissary
wagon, the supplies in which consi&teil
mostly of bottles. In addition there was
a throng of boys in masks and many good
individual costumes. * V
The costumes were better than those in
many a pretentious masquerade. But it
seemed that Oakland had reserved all its
noise for the evening. .'Firecrackers,
bombs, fireworks and everything tha t
could, make noise or light was ,used. .It
Is said' that. more fireworks and firecrack
ers were discharged to-night than at any
other celebration in the history of the
town. . . ''
The streets were decorated with rows of
Chinese lanterns and there was an excel
lent display of fireworks in the City Hall
Park, making a fitting ending to a day of
which Oakland is proud..

OAKLAND, July 4.â The physicians in
attendance upon Superior Judge Frank
B- Oeden at his country residence
near IsTlles have decided that with
the slight improvement In their V pa
tient's condition to-day they will not "per*
form an operation. Although there is no
question that the patient Is suffering. from
an acute attack of appendicitis, the doc
tors are now hopeful that he will recover,
and thit the, drastic measures of a sur
gical operation can be avoided. ,'

Indeed, the doctors were extremely con

chow signs of rallying from the severe
ordeal of suffering he had undergone dur
ing the day. But toward morning the en
couraging signs of an Improvement re
warded the long vigil of the physicians
and the family, reinforced by trained
nurses who had been ordered from this
city. as the Judge's condition grew stead

Freight Handlers Expect
Assistance From'
Switchmen.
Railroad Managers Say That
Trouble Will Be Soon
Settled.
ST. LOUIS, July 4.â This being a holi
day no attempt was made by the transfer '
companies to do anything in . East St. i
Louis to-day. All Is quiet. Both sides are *
waiting for to-morrow -with no little trep- .}
idation. The number of men out is now
about 2000, and is the cause of thousand3 ;
of dollars' loss to business men of St. '
*Louis, who have merchandise" tied up in ]
car3 or freight houses. '
The striking truckers and sorters, who ;
have called out with them the platform -
clerks to the number of 300, and about the_ .
same number of teamsters, assert that the" '
switchmen will strike co-morrow in sym- â¢
pathy. This, it is asserted, would mean <
the complete paralyis of freight traffic on ;
the East Side. The railroad managers, on j
the other hand, declare that by Friday the .
trouble .will be over. The strike of the '
teamsters, they say. is the most serious
phase of the situation so far, and with the
teamsters at work they would be able to
handle all the freight offered. A strike ;
among the switchmen, they say, is some- ,
thing they do not fear. '
In the present contingency the roads ,
having freight houses on the Missouri side
and those which use the Terminal ware- .
houses are consigning both inbound and !
outbound goods direct. Â» :
The only freight moving practically is
that belonging to concerns who "own or
hire their own wagons. No attempt has \
been made to interfere with this' traffics j

CLEBGYMEN CRITICISE . ,
ACTS OF JUDGE PALMER
Enter Protest Against the Upholding
, of Injunction Sued Out by the : t
Saloon People. j
j DENVER, July 4.â A committee of seven Â¦<
j prominent clergymen, representing the va- J
rious denominations appointed at a meet- <
Ing of ministers to draw up a statement s
expressing their views concerning Judge c
Palmer's action in the saloon and con
tempt cases, to-day mailed to Governor
Orman and Judge Palmer a letter which, ;
after reviewing all the facts in these cases
and expressing a desire "not by any criti-
I cism to impede the course of justice, but
rather to support and uphold" the judl- (
clary," concludes as follows:
We desire to utter a profound and solemn
protest against the act of Judge Palmer In
tying up the police administration of the city
\ by injunction. We are Intensely grieved and
â¢ indignant because such Injunction has been T
| made permanant by the refusal of Judge Pal- (
i mer to consider the motion of the City Attor- j
n->y to ditsolve the temporary injunction.
We feel, however, that those injunction pro- '
ceedinES which were originated by the saloon ]
! men and those contempt l-roceedlngs which j
j have been pushed by the saloon men ought *
1 to increase the ardor, enthusiasm and courage (
of the members and officers, of the Anti-Sa- ,
loon League and all lovers of law and order. Â«

COLORADO MINE
Appeal Made to Gov
ernor to Order Out
'â¢ the Militia. v
Will Send Troops to Scene
Unless the Property Is"
r Surrendered/
DENVER, July 4.â According to a spe
cial to the News from Telluride, Colo.,
nothing of a serious nature has occurred
at the Smuggler-Union mine, the scene of
the fight with striking miners yesterday.
The strikers aro In possession of the mine
and no communication can be had with
them. The citizens' committee of five, ap
pointed last week to effect a settlement of
the trouble with the men, met to-day with
Manager Collins, but it cannot be learned
what decision was arrived at, If any; ' It
seems that the mine was turned over to
the strikers upon an agreement that four
or five men should be allowed to remain
and guard the property and that the work
in the mine should, cease. It was also
agreed that the strikers should be permit
ted to run air the men at work in the
mine over the range. The men were then
lined up and, it is said, some were struck
on the head with revolvers and other
wise-beaten as they marched to the top of
the range. They were told, it Is said, nev
er to return to that side of the divide
again.
To-night the following telegraphic cor
respondence passed between Governor Or
man and Arthur L. Collins, manager of
the Smuggler- Union mine at Telluride:
TELLURIDE, Colo., July 4, 1901â Governor
Orman, Denver: An unprovoked attack was
made . UDon' our DroDerty Wednesday morning
by several hundred armed, .masked men. Valu
able property was destroyed, two men, killed
and several severely wouTided. The rest of the
men were- driven across the range. The des
peradoes now have forcible possession of the
mine. The Sheriff says he is powerless to givÂ«
us possession of our property or protect the
lives of our employes and has called for troops,
which were denied. Without this protection
the property must be indefinitely abandoned.
Will you telegraph me a,dvice and furnish us
protection?
The Smuggler-Union Mining Company,
ARTHUR L. COLLINS, Manpger._
Governor Orman immediately wired ai
follows: . â¢
DENVER, July 4â Arthur L. Collins, Man
ager Smugeler-Union Mining Company,
Telluride, Colo. : The unlawful posses
ion of ' property will not .be toler
ated â¢ in this. State and if the â¢ property
is not immediately surrendered to its rightful
owners immediate action will t>e taken by the
State authority and all the parties implicated
severely dealt with. The Sheriff has not been
denied troop^.'

DISCHARGED SOLDIERS
GUILTY OF' ROWDY <ACT3
One of Them Fatally Shot and An
other Receives a Bullet Through
the Leg.
ALBUQUERQUE. N. M., July 4.â Two
wounded men, one fatally injured and the
other shot through the leg, were brought
here^jate last night on one of the soldier
trains passing through to the East. Near
Holbrook the discharged negro soldiers
got to shooting promiscuousiy through
and out of the cars, and Frank Phillips,
colored, received a ball in ti.e abdomen,
while a white soldier, named W. A. Ever
sole and claiming Denver as his home,
was shot through the fleshy part of his
right leg. A woman living in a small town
west of here was coming out of a door
when one of the soldier trains was pass
ing and a bullet through her
arm. â¢
Frank Sheppard, the colored soldier who
was killed on the train Tuesday night
near Navajo Springs and brought to this
city, will be burled here by charity to
morrow if his people in Huntsville, Ala.,
are not heard from. â¢
At Winslow vesterday before the soldier
train reached that town the citizens armed
themselves with" shotguns and rifles, and
when the train stopped at the depot would
not allow the soldiers to leave the cars
and ordered the railroad officials to pull
out with the train forthwith. All the dis
charged soldiers carry arms and are ac
cused of committing- many depredations
along the route.

I have.no apprehensions for Calvary Church
as long as Dr. Hemphill shall continue to stand
In Its pupilt, for his ringing voice will, ever
preach the gospel of the redemption of man,
â¢ San Francisco to-day occupies a larger tract
in the vision of the East than any other city
of the country. This new Calvary Church al
most overlooks Golden Gate, and you will not
be true to your traditions if you do not catch
the spirit of the new century and join heart
and soul in the missionary movement.
Th<- hand of man lays' the cornerstone, . but
men have gone before with pick and shovel,
getting down to hard rock. When men put up
a building they must first dig down to the
virgin cornerstone laid by the Almighty. So
in the edifice of faith, we must lay, the cor
nerstone on that which God has already laid.
â¢ This removal Â¦ signalizes the fact of the
progress of Calvary Church. It is a twentieth
century movement. Those of us who have been
here for /the past seventeen years are able to
recount evidences of progress of the church
here in California. Calvary Church has been
a center of influence for. morality and higher
life and Christian truth. - â¢ ,
There Is a fitness in the laying of this cor
nerstone on . the Fourth of July, for we have
always taken pride in the fact that the Pres
byterian church has been an important factor
in the defense of the liberties of our people.
Rev. Dr. Henry C. Minton,, moderator of

Church of the United States, was the next

Presbyterlanism.
Director Roberts â¢ and Superintendent
Leach have certain suspicions, but they
will not make any statements as to whom
they suspect until further evidence is
forthcoming. Superintendent Leach and
Cashier Cole, who are under bonds, will
be held civilly liable to the Government
for the loss of. the Bold coin.
The rule of the Mint was that the cashier's
vault should be checked up each night. This
was done regularly by Chief Clerk Dimmick.
The vault had become so crowded with sacks
of gold that it was impossible at times to see
and count every bag at night. No violence
was used on the cashier's vault when this
money was abstracted. The thief must have
been an emDloye of the Mint. How or when
the money was taken it is impossible to say.
The cashier's office closes each day at 3 p. m.
and the vault is closed and locked by its com
bination. The time lock does not becin to
operate until 5 p. m. Between 3 and 5 p. m.
the combination would er>en the vault, but
how could the money have been taken from
the carefully guarded building? There is but
one entrance and that is always watched by
our euards. The money was certainly not
taken in a lump sum. It would not have been
possible for six sacks of gold to have been
taken out of the building without the watch
men noticing the same.
The administration of Superintendent Leach
has been most successful, aside from this oc
currence.' The output of the Mint for the past
year has broken all records and the percentage
of wastage on the metal coined has been very
small. I congratulated Mr. Leach and did the
same to Cashier Cole and their various assist
ants when I was engaged last Saturday in
examining the affairs of the Mint. That rec
ord stands as testimony to competent services.
That was before the shortage was dlscgvered
by Mr. Leach himself In checking up the
cashier's vault. ;
The shortage was discovered in the last vault
counted, which is the cashier's vault, used
daily for business purposes. This vault should
liave contained $25,487,197 43, ' but there was a
discrepancy of $30,000. â¢ 'The .'shortage was in
double eaeles. There should have been 1515
bags of double eagles,' containing $5000 each.
The. vault only 'contained 1509 bags.
The books show that . there should be $104,r
432.1&7 45 on liand in the Mint in coin, in
addition Â¦ to considerable bullion. The bullion
Is all right, but the coin is short $30,000.
The Mint was closed yesterday, owing
to the day being a legal holiday, but Se
cret Service Agent Hazen was busily en
gaged in working on the case and a watch
was kept on certain suspected persons.
Director Roberts gave out a public^
statement in which he says that -when
thu, shortage was first discovered it was
hoped that an error in bookkeeping would
account for the missing $30,000, but that a
careful rechecking of the accounts show
ed that the books were correct, and that
six sacks, containing $5000 each, had been
abstracted from the cashier's vault in the
last three months. The statement con
tains the following:
â new developed yesterday in the
matter of the theft of $30,000 in gold coin
from the cashier's vault of the United
States Mint in this city. George E. Rob

mit that a theft has been committed by
one- or more of the local branch Mint em

E. Randolph, division superintendent at

effect on the first of next month. Ran

iran and his services will be missed by
the Southern Pacific Company.
It is not known who will take Ran
dolph's place,, at Tucson, but an appoint

It is rumored that the lines in Oregon
of the Southern Pacific system will be
assimilated with the Pacific system in the

E. RA2?DOLPH RESIGNS
This is not the first occasion. It Is said,
on which Wilson has displayed his hatred
for the children of the neighborhood. On
the 14th of last February he is accused of
having brutaily beaten a little boy about
the bead with a loaded cane for playing
a practical joke. He is known to have al
ways carried a pistol, and frequently he
terrified the children of the vicinity by
displaying it in a threatening manner.
Only yesterday afternoon he exhibited his
pistol to Mrs. Chessman, a neighbor, re
siding- at 173 Shipley street. Wilson is
considered by the people residing In the
vicinity of his residence as extremely
Quarrelsome and overbearing.
Maggie Hartwell. the little victim, is
very frail. She is deemed an extremely
bright child. Che formerly attended the
sisters' school on Grove street.'
At the time of the shooting there were
more than fifty children playing in the
street, but none of them saw the man fire
the shot. When the little girl was struck
phe was standing fully 125 feet from Wil
son's house, watching the fireworks which
the other children were setting off. Mrs.
A. Cademartori, who lives directly oppo
site from Wilson's residence, saw the flash
of the revolver, although she could not
distinguish the man who fired it because
of the darkness.
Exhibits Pistol to Mrs. Chessman.
Two chambers of the weapon contained
empty cartridges, and it was evident that
the pistol had been used quite recently.
When shown the weapon, Wilson ac
knowledged that it was his and said that
he had flred a shot from it during the
afternoon, using a near-by fence as a
target.
Wilson Is a large, powerful man and
about 65 years of age. He was a member
of the local police force for ten years,
but resigned twelve years ago.
Mre. Hartwell, the girl's mother, lives
at 2!*j Shipley street. She is a widow
and depends upon her two sons, aged 14
and 29 respectively, for the family's sup
port.
Later the officers returned to his house
and after a search located a 38-caliber
Colt's revolver.
Wilson denied the accusation against
him, and declared that the girl was mis
taken.. He 6aid to the officers at the hos
pital that he had fired no shot and de
nied that he had a pistol.
Wilson was arrested by Officers R. H.
Beamer and W. E. Eskew and brought
to the hospital. The little girl identified
him positively as her assailant.
Maggie Identifies Wilson.
An examination showed that the bullet
had passed through the right arm and
had lodged in the stomach. Dr. Armis
tead probed the wound, but failed to lo
cate the bullet.
One of the boys saw the little girl fall,
and as he picked her up she told him
that she had been shot in the stomach.
The ambulance was sent for and the
wounded girl was taken to the Receiving
Hospital.
In relating the story the little one tald
that Borne boys were firing crackers near
Wilson's house and that one was thrown
on bis porch. Wilson, she said, came
from his house and stealthily approaching
the group of boys pulled his pistol and
fired pointblank at the crowd.
The girl was taken to the j- Central
Emergency Hospital, -where she 'made a
statement In which she accused Robert
Wilson, an ex-police officer, of having 1
â¢willfully flred the shot that injured her.
Maggie Hartwell. an 11-year-old girl,
â¢was ehot In the abdomen and probably
fatally wounded last night on Shipley
etreet. near Fifth.

PEACZFTTI/ BEATS OF ,
WEL3J-KNOWN" PIONEER
Andrew Jackson Cogbill, an Old
Resident of This City, Passes
Away at His Home.
"With the coming of last evening' death
called Andrew Jackson Coghill, one of the
men of '50, who spent the best years of
his life with the growth of San Fran
cisco. He died at his home, 1614 Union
street.
Mr. Coghill was born In Lloyd. Va.. in
1828.. He came to California and to San
Francisco in 1S50, and until- 1883 was a
prominent figure in the business life of
the growing city. He was a. member of
the Vigilance Committee, and while he
never held public office he was well known
In both business and social' life. He had
a turn for the pen and he contributed
more than one bit of prose and verse to
the papers of the early days, besides arti
cles of much literary value. '
In 1SS3 he went to Healdsburgr, where
he had purchased a farm, and for several
years he lived in the country. Then he
returned to San Francisco and here he
lived until his end. He was ill for sev
eral months before his death and was
often In pain, but the end came peace-
The Rev. Dr. William A. Alexander of
the San Anselmo .Theological' Seminary
opened the exercises with an invocation.
A hymn, "Sing to the Lord with Cheerful
Voice," was read- by- Rabbi Jacob'. Nieto.
after which it was sung by the audience.
A responsive reading of. Psalm cxxil
was led by the Rev. George G. -Eldredge,
pastor of St. John's Presbyterian Church.
After another hymn was â¢ sung- â "Oh,
Where Are Kings and Kmpires Now?" â
the Rev. Dr. George C. Adams, pastor of
the First Congregational Church, road
"Solomon's Prayer." â¢ â¢â¢â¢ '
The opening address was made by Bish
op J. \V\ Hamilton of the Methodist Epis.
'copal Church, who spoke in part as fol

Bishop Hamilton Speaks.
PIETY and patriotism mingled in
the ceremony of laying the cor
nerstone- of the new- Calvary
Presbyterian Church, at the cor
ner of . Jackson and Fillmore
streets, yesterday afternoon. The staunch,
unswerving Presbyterians of that congre
gation did not forget in the triumph and
exultation of the occasion the significance
of the day to the country at large, and
tributes to political liberty and prayers
that the nation might endure were heard
as frequently as reference to church
achievements and appeal for divine guid
ance and' for divine favor for the new
edifice dedicated so auspiciously to the
worship of the L.ord.
The exercises were held upon a platfcrm
! elevated seven or eight feet, to the height
of the foundation stones upon which the
huge sandstone block, the cornerstone of
the magnificent new edifice, was to rest.
From staffs nailed to the platform and
to the top of the hoisting derrick towering
in the midst of the beginnings of -walls
of brick and' stone, there fluttered many
flags. The sharp explosion of firecrackers
punctuated the addresses of eminent di
vines, and the roar of the city celebrating
was a fit accompaniment to jubilant Prot
estant hymns of praise. â¢
Representatives of the clergy of every
Protestant denomination In the city- were
present on the platform.- The remaining
chairs were occupied by prominent lay
men of the Calvary and other congrega
tions. Hundreds of men and women stood
within the boundaries of the church foun
dations, gathering as closely" abouf the
platform as possible. An organ was placod
at the base of the hoisting. derrick and the
church choir, grouped about it, led the
singing. : â¢ â¢ . '. . . .. . ,
