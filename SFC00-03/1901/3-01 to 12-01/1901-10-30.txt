Wounded Negroes Escape.
No one is able to estimate the number
of wounded negroes who escaped the car

to the four winds. Some are known to
have been shot, but they have not been
found.
The fierce conflict raged for* half an
hour. Those at a distance say the firing
sounded like a pitched battle between
troops. % -.V; â¢? r!f >
To the camp meeting negroes had come
from 200 miles, all up and down the valley.
Elder Stephen Duncan of New Orleans,
for whom the" chapel was named, was
present .
Last Thursday the meeting opened with
several hundred- negroes encamped around
the church in tents and in rudel7 con
structed shanties. It was to continue one
week. . There they^ate and slept and held
services in the chapel. One day previous
to the opening of the camp meeting the
negro. Bill Morris, had been burned at the
stake near Balltown for -an assault on
Mrs. J. J. Ball. Public feeling was at a
high pitch. Under those conditions the
negroes gathered at Live Oak. There was
trouble over a license and Crear . Lotfa
tent became the center of contention.

but no bloodshed. It came up Sunday

The blacks fled from the frail wooden
church, for it was no ' shelter from the
rain of bullets. Lott retired into his tent,
shooting and fighting. Joe Seal received
his death wound. A torrent' of lead was
sent whizzing into the tent and church"
as the negroes fled.
Preacher Connelly was shot while stand

inside the house. The other negroes
around Lott's place kept up a steady rain
of bullets. It was death and blood and
the shrieks of the wounded and dying
were heard oh every side. Lott's ofd
mother-in-law, his two daughters \ and
the little boy fell in a heap inside the
shelter.. Sophia Lott saved her life by
concealing herself behind a stove. There
she escaped and the men did not harm
her.' They were after Crear Lott. He was
barricaded and the next move was to fire

SALINAS, Oct. 29.â The trial of an im
portant land suit was begun this morning
before Judge Dorn in the Superior Court
The Commercial and Savings Bank pf San
Jose seeks to recover 517,000 and costs, the
whole amounting to $22,000, from the es
tate of the late William B. True of San
Francisco. The bank claims the amount
on a note secured by a mortgage on 84s.65
acres of land near Salinas, known as tho
Los Vergeles Rancho. The I mortgage
was given by True, it is alleged, when he
purchased the ranch from Mitchell Phil
lips.
True, In his answer and cross complaint,
had alleged that Phillips and F. W.
Moore conspired to defraud him by in
ducing him to pay more for the land than
it was worth. The administrator of his
estate avers that "on April 11 True, Phil
lips and Moore were playing cards at the
ranch house; that True was constantly
plied with liquor by said other parties
and that while he was under the influence
of liquor Phillips proposed to sell the
property to him for $25,000, although an
offer had been made of $45,000 for the
same land. Phillips, , when told that True
had money, said he would take $8000
cash, so as to pay a mortgage thereon,
and a mortgage fpr $17,000. .- True, in his
weakened condition, went with Moore and
Phillips to a lawyer's office, where, "he
alleges, he found a deed/mortgage and
note already made out. He signed ths
same without investigation. He claims
that he owes nothing, as the real value of
the property is only $25,000."
The plaintiffs deny all the allegations
in True 1 s answer and claim that True
knew what he was about when I he pur
chased the ranch. ,

"Would not the fact that from thirty-six to
forty-eight hours was necessary in covering
this distance have brought the Spaniards to
Cienfuegos after your arrival there?"
"I did not wish to be understood that that
time would have been necessary for the Span
lards to make the voyage. I meant simply to
give the time consumed by the flying squad
ron in making: the voyage."
"That would be a guess; perhaps a mile."
Going back to the Adula' s appearance at
Cienf uepos. Captain Lemly asked about' thÂ«
war bulletin brought by that vessel and -atked
If It had not stated that the Spanish fleet lad
left there May 20. This the witness admliled
was true as he also did that he had sail the
distance from Clenfuegos to Santiago was fram
thirty-six to forty-eight hours. Then Captain
1/emly asked:
Tne admiral explained that that entry did
not necessarily mean that the Scorpion was
absolutely In touch with the fleet As he re
called it. all the ships were drifting.
"Did you regard her under these circum
stances as a picket boat?"
"I did. Ehe was drifting Inshore."
"How far insider*
The Judge advocate then passed to Clen
fuegos. examining Schley upon his statement
that upon the arrival of the squadron there the
Scorpion was sent In as a picket boat and asked
htm to reconcile that statement with the en
try in the log of the Scorpion to the effect
that from midnight to 4 a. m., "drifted in com
pany with the fleet for the remainder of the
watch."
Before resuming the cross-examination of
Admiral Schley Judge Advocate Lemly an
nounced that with tne assent of counsel for
the other Bide the fiU-nal books of the New-
York for .May IS and Vt and July 2 and July 3
ana the Brooklyn's for May 18 to June 2, in
clusive, and July 2 and 3, would be Included
In the record. He explained that May 18 and
U were the day before and the day on which
the New York left Key West. The nrÂ«t ques
tion the judge advocate asked was in connec
tion with Admiral Schley' s examination in
chief regarding the meeting with the Eagle
Miter the flying squadron leu Key West.
"You said you had a distinct recollection that
the l^acie passed within . nail In the Yucatan
Channel and that Ehe reported no news."
"Not in the Yucatan Channel. We passed
the Eagle soon after leaving Key West."
"She passed within haiir* 1
"That la my recollection."
"And reported no newsT"
"Yes."
"As you sent the Scorpion to communicate
with her do you not think you were in error?"
"Ao. I do not think I am mistaken."
"Did the Ragle report anything else?"
"No; only that she had no news."
WASHINGTON. Oct. 29.â Judge Advocate
Lemly resumed the cross-examination of Rear
Admiral Schley after the court convened at
11 o'clock to-day. 'When the court adjourned
yesterday he was" still questioning the wit
ness with reference to the cruise from Clen-
Juegros to Santiago and he resumed to-day
where he had left off yesterday, asking a num
ber of questions relatlns to the condition of
the weather on May 23 and 26, the dates of
the voyaee. ,He also reverted to the detach
ing of the Eagle from the flying- squadron and
brourht the witness to the consideration of
several other minor details of that '.movement
before coming to the meeting with the scout
boats, twenty-five miles south of Santiago on
the evening of May 2Â». when the retrograde
movement toward Key West in search of coal
was be^un.
Judge Advocate Resumes Cross-Ex
amination of the Admiral.
TESTIMONY OP SCBXEY.
In the course of the cross-examination
the admiral said he regarded the depart
ment's dispatch rather as a suggestion
than as an explicit order, & suggestion
which he carried out after the sea had
abated and the coal supply of the ships
had been replenished.
Throughout the strain to which the wit
ness naturally was subjected while under
examination the admiral retained his cus
tomary composure. Only once or twice
did he display impatience or weariness. At
one point when asked a question he re
plied that he had been asked the same
question yesterday, at the same time tell
ing what his reply, had been then. On
another occasion, when he was being
searchtngly interrogated as to his dis
tances from Bhore at Cienf eugos and as
to whether the distances were a matter
of record, he responded rather tartly:
"Oh. no. I did not know these ever
would become a matter of such great Im
portance orÂ«I should have platted them
and made a memorandum as I would of
many other things." /
The mam points to which the cross-ex
amination was directed to-day were the
ability of the ships to coal off Cienfuegos'
and the reasons for what is known as the
"retrograde movement.^' The latter point
was dwelt upon with much emphasis and
detail and had not been disposed of fully
when the court adjourned. The admit al
gave three reasons for turning back:
First, the statement of Captain Sigsbee,
who cemmanded the scout ship St. Paul,
that the enemy was not in Santiago; sec
ond, the opinion of Nunez, the pilot, that
the entrance was too narrow and shallow
for the Spanish fleet to enter, and third,
the ambiguity of the department's tele
cram.
The judge^ advocate, in conducting 1 the
cross-examination, used a carefully pre
pared typewritten list of questions. They
called lor a comparison of statements Ad
miral Schley has made either in his direct
testimony. In his communication to the
Senate or in his dispatches to Admiral
Sampson or the Navy Department, with
the testimony of witnesses who have pre
ceded him and the logs and signal books
of the other vessels ot the fleet. Tne ques
tions were not asked in chronological or
der, but jumped from one subject to an
other and from one stage of the campaign
to another.
The progress made was ex
ceedingly slow. Practically the whole day
Was consumed in questioning the admiral
about the cruise from Clenfuegos to San
tiago end the motives and influences that
governed him in turning: -back -after his
squadron . had arrived ,in the vicinity of
the latter port. This latter branch of the
cross-examination had not been concluded
when tbe court adjourned. -
The blockade at Santiago, the recon
noissance on May 31 and the "battle of July
2 still remain to 1 be- covered. It is hardly
probable that the judge advocate can con
clude before adjournment . to-morrow.
After he finishes quite a number of ques
tions prepared by the members of . the
court will be submitted.
__ _. WASHINGTON. Oct. 29.â The
Vi \\ V cross-examination of Admiral
\J\J "Schley was continued through
V V the court of inquiry to-day.
"Did you on May 24, before McCalla report
ed that the fleet was not In Clenfuegos. con-
"The log -of the Brooklyn shows that on
May 24 the sea was smooth. Why then on
that day did you In your report to Admiral
Sampson express apprehension of difficulty In
coaling off Santiago?"' \
."As I have stated before a sea that would
be smooth for. the Brooklyn would be rough
for smaller vessels."
The admiral was then proceeding to read. the
signals from the Iowa, > Massachusetts and
Texas to the. flagship relative to coal when
Captain Lemly Interrupted to say that the ad
miral had already testified to those signals
in his testimony In chief, whereupon Captain
Parker protested that It was unfair, to the
witness to ask for signals and then stop him
as soon as he had begun to comply. Captain
Lemly. disclaimed any desire to be unfair. What
he wanted was signals Indicating solicitude for
coal. Thereupon Admiral Schley proceeded with
the reading of the signals. After he had read
about twenty he looked . ux>.
"Do you want any more?" he Inquired.
"Not unless Captain Parker does," replied
Captain Lemly. .â\u25a0:-. . .
"I am satisfied. If the admiral is," observed
Captain Parker. '\u25a0 . .
"Which of these signals Indicates solicitude T"
Captain Lemly asked. , .
"I should say all or most of them," replied
the witness.
Captain- 1 Lemly at this point went back to
the stater of the sea.
In response Admiral Schley said that when
the Iowa arrived at Clenfuegos she only had
about half her coal supply aboard and almost
her first request was for coal from the collier.
"Did Ehe get coal?" - . -
"Yes. She took on abput 200 tons.". ...
Questions as to Coal.
Captain Lemly asked the admiral to point
out the signals of the Massachusetts and Texas
showing solicitude about coal and also to In
clude \u25a0 the Iowa.
"I -think all the vessels were more or less
ehort of their complement, and considering
the fact that they ought' to be fit for any
service and , for every service that In -arriving
off the port we should be more than half or
three-quarters full."
"How about the Brooklyn? Ehe had plenty
of coal, did she not?"
"I don't think there was ever any question
about the Brooklyn."
"How about the Massachusetts?"
"The Massachusetts and the Texas were con
stantly solicitous about coal."
"Did you In the same dispatch , Inform Ad
miral Sampson that one of the battleships had
been coaled on that day?"
"1 reported that fact to him on May SO."
Referring to the blockade of Santiago. Captain
Lemly asked the witness why he had sent a
dispatch to Admiral Sampson that "on account
of short coal supply, cannot blockade them (the
Spaniards) in. Santiago ?"-
"I meant that if we could not have coaled off
Santiago, we could not have stayed there."
"Did you state that condition T'
"No; I did not state that condition. That
was the impression In my mind."
"What did you mean by the report. 'I shall
not be able to remain off that port (Santiago)
on account of short coal supply?' "
"I was aware of that regulation, yes; but
my papers after being boxed up were inadvert
ently sent after me to Porto Rico after ' the
close of the campaign. I did not return to the
Cnited States until. November.. I then deliv
ered them as required." 1
Captain Lemly then questioned the witness
regarding the wind off Clenluegos while the
flying squadron was there. Admiral Schley had
stated in his testimony In chief that the wind
then was fresh. Captain Lemly called the at
tention of the witness to the log of the Brook
lyn for May 23 and 24. The log showed the
Etate of the wind at different periods on those
dates, varying from one to four.
"WhJ 1 did you. on the day the Iowa coaled
from the Merrimac, May 23, inform* Admiral
Sampson that coaling off Clenfuegos was very
uncertain?" . . , ,-',\u25a0> -â¢-:,*
"Simply on account of the weather."
"You coaled one of the battleships?"
In response to other questions Admiral Schley
said there were three or four boats stretched
across the harbor at Cienfuegos. -
Captain Lemly called the attention of \u25a0 the
witness to the fact that In his former, testimony
he had said that Lieutenant Wood had reported
him as speaking disrespectfully of Admiral
Sampson, calling him captain. The admiral re
plied that he might; have got Wood confused
with Hood and upon referring to the cÂ»Sfrt rec
ord he said it was true that Wood had not so
testified. The admiral was \u25a0 again questioned
concerning the return of his papers to the Navy
Department. â¢â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0
â¢ 'â¢All my papers," he replied, "were packed In
a box and so far as I know not a single one was
left, except some blueprints, and the second
copy of the 'Dear Schley* letter, which was put
in an envelope and retained."
"You were aware of the department's regula
tion requirine- that all papers should be re
turned upon surrendering a flagship?"
"There were none. I do not consider that
the regulations or customs required written in
structions."
"Is It not the unwritten law at sea that the
vessels In squadron shall follow the flag?".
"Yes, except under, certain circumstances."
"What â¢ circumstances ?"
"Well, a vessel might see one of the enemy's
ships drop out and follow to attack her. That
might be one of the circumstances."-
"Yes," replied the witness; "but as the en
tries do not show the speed it is impossible
to tell the distance. We usually steamed as
slowly as possible, simply kept tsteerage.-way."
"Had Cervera's fleet appeared â¢ during the
nights you were at Clenfuegos. either coming
out or coming in from seaward, what, under
your instructions, would your fleet' have done?"
"Knocked them out." (A stir In court.)
"What were your Instructions?" I '
"To follow the flag â Instructions given at
Hampton Roads." "
"What were your written instructions?"
Admiral Schley said he kept a close watch
at day and at night, while awake, while off
Cienfuegos. He said he had seen no auxiliary
cruiser or gunboat near the entrance to the
harbor, as testified to by Lieutenant Griffin.
The witness had an Indistinct recollection of
having seen the mast or perhaps the top of
a pipe over the hills.- He saw nothing larger
coming near the mouth of the harbor than an
ordinary steam launch. 'â¢\u25a0â¢;'Â» '\u25a0/:
In response to a request from Captain Lemly
the witness read extracts from the Brooklyn's
log,, with a view of showing that the admiral's
memory had been at fault when he had stated
that the fleet was closer in at night than dur
ing the day time. The admiral had also testi
fied that the set of the current was toward
the ehore. The log showed that at various
times the squadron had steamed in as well
as out. Captain Lemly called his attention to
the log on the following day. May 24, and
asked him whether these entries In the log
should not show that the ships steamed both
in and out.
Schley Was on Watch.
The admiral, In answer to another question
by Captain Lemly.- said he had platted the
distance on a chart for his own information.
He did n Â°t know this would ever become a
matter of such importance, otherwise he should
have kept the memorandum as he would have
kept a great many other things.
"In the daytime I took a bow and beam bear
ing. This, together- with the surf and the
land, seemed to confirm that that distance was
correct."
Reverting to the blockade of Cienfuegos, Cap
tain Lemly asked the witness how he estimated
the distance of the blockading fleet to be be
tween three and four miles from shore.
Instructions Sent From Washington to the Com
mander of the Flying Squadron Are Declared by
Him to Have Been of a Very Ambiguous Character
ORDER FROM THE DEPARTMENT
NOT CLEAR IN THE WORDING
REAR ADMIRAL SCHLEY TELLS MEMBERS OF THE NAVAL COURT OF INQUIRY
REASONS WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO MAKE THE FAMOUS RETROGRADE MOVEMENT
assertion made by a pilot '
One cause for departure
Assurances Given by Nunez and Also by Captain
: J h Sigsbee of the Scout Ship St. Paul That Span
ish Fleet. Had Not Passed Into Santiago Harbor
keep me informed. Those ' scouts represented
very largely, the cavalry of an army, and If
they were unreliable they should not have- been
placed there. I must have relied upon what
they said." '
Schley again spoke of the dispatch of the de
partment indicating that the Spanish fleet was
still at Santiago as ambiguous and said that
the information that there were Cubans five
or six miles west of Santiago- was erroneous,
for the Cuban pilot, Nunez, had informed him
to the contrary. He claimed that the dispatch
also was ambiguous In the matter of coaling
the Harvard from the Merrimac.
"Why do you revert to No. 7 when you had
dispatch No. 8 in your possession?" . â¢ '
"I merely reverted ' to No. 7 as one of tha
doubtful questions." ; '\u25a0-\u25a0-.
"If you will look at the memorandum of No.
8 you will also find that Admiral Sampson
held to the view that when you left Clenfuegos
the Spanish squadron probably . would leave:
Santiago." .
"Of course, lf,I had gone to the eastward
and exposed the westward there might have
been more serious consequences."
"Now do you note in this communication
which you have, been referring to these -words.
The department looks to you to ascertain
facts and that the enemy, . if therein, does - not
leave! without a decisive action.' Did you take
any steps further than you have stated to
ascertain the facts?" V.
"No. I thought that the Information -which
I had was pretty conclusive. â¢ I did not see
anything in this dispatch, however, that par
takes of an order; It is rather a suggestion.
There Is a vast difference between communica
tions .that come to you in the nature of sug
gestions and. those that come to you in the
nature of orders. I think the department
never hesitates to 'order distinctly when it is
decided about matters. All this points to the
fact that there was no certain Information In
the possession of anybody . that the enemy was
really there and that which they had was not
to be relied upon, or that it was untrust
worthy."
"In regard to this landing place five - or six
miles west of the harbor you say. you ascer
tained subsequently that the Spanish were
there and not Cubans?"
"So Nunez stated on the 1st. and upon that
I predicated the remark that if .we had land
ed in that position probably we would - have
been gobbled ui>."
"You did not try to land there?"
"No. thank God. I did not."
"You did . not follow up that cue and find
out at \u25a0. that time whether insurgents J were
there, did you?" â¢ *
"Perhaps It is luclty I did not."
"Don't you think perhaps it might have been
lucky if you had?" . \u25a0
"No. I do not think so." ' '
"You did not know really who was present
there at that time?"
"Personally I did not know, only In the light
of what I subsequently heard."
"Did you not in fact finally accept the dis
patch of the department as an order to re
main off Santiago and so Indicate In telegrams
and signals without yourself acquiring- any
further Information as to the whereabouts of
the Spanish fleet?"- i â¢\u25a0
Raynorâ The word "remain" is not in that
dispatch. It is in the Secretary's letter. I
think the Secretary has Inadvertently fallen
Into an error about that. -\u25a0 :â¢
Captain Lemlyâ "What is the point of the
question?-
Raynorâ My point is that you. use the word
"remain" in referring to the dispatch and the
Secretary of the Navy used the same - word,
when the word- "remain" Is not In the dis
patch. - - . â¢..
Captain Lemlyâ I had no point to makÂ» on
that \u25a0 I simply read that word "remain" .'in
trying to paraphrase the question. J-. 5" -.
Rajtnoiv-It-lsinct a. correct paraphrase. -â¢â¢ .\u25a0â¢ >
" Captain Lemlyâ The wbra. "remain" Is not
in that (reading) : "The department looks to
jnu to aseertain tae^, 11 ; tha enemy is in
there do not" leave without declslva action.
Raynor â The enemy did not leave without a
decisive action and he did ascertain the faots.
but the trouble Is the Secretary of the Navy
has used the word "remain." You see it im
plies there was a dispatch to him. to remain
at Santiago.
Captain Lemlyâ Then I will change my ques
tion and ask if you did not accept it as re
questing you to return and if. as a matter of
fact, you did not remain off Santiago after
that?
Admiral Schleyâ No, . I think that my reason
for remaining- ... .
Captain Lemlyâ Remaining or returning?
Admiral Schleyâ I mean remaining in .that
neighborhood.
Hanna â The Impropriety of your referring to
a letter of the Secretary of i the Navy j is ob
vious. .. .,â¢
Raynorâ It Is in evidence.
Hannaâ It is in evidence, hut it has no rela
tion to the subject.
Raynorâ Don't say that a letter of the Secre
tary of the Navy is not in evidence. It la as
much in evidence as' any documents in tha
world. This is a very important matter. It
Is an Inadvertence on the part of the Secretary
of the Navy, entirely unintentional. "He uses
the word "remain" when that word is not in
the original - dispatch. \ 7 4
Captain Lemlyâ If the court please, this is
what they call In football "Interference." and
It Is for no other J purpose whatever than to
interfere with the examination of this mat
ter.
Captain Parkerâ It is "interferenca" that fre
quently wins the game.
At this point the court took Its usual recess
for luncheon. After the recess Captain. Lemly
repeated his question of. tha forenoon as fol
lows: '
"Did you not accept it (meaning tha order
referred to previously) as requiring you to re
turn? As a matter of fact did you not re
main off Santiago after that?"
Admiral Schleyâ I said -that after the coaling
efficiency of tho squadron had been established
on a basis of -equality, and as we were not
very distant from Santiago. In view of ths
Secretary's suggestion I returned to ascertain
definitely whether the enemy was In port.
Upon our return we 'discovered' the Spanish
squadron in the harbor. We may. have been'
perhaps four and & half miles or four miles.
"We were always nearer at night than In tha
day time.
Captain Lemly then asked If tha picket
boats were two miles inside of the squadron.
Admiral Schley replied In the affirmative and
added: "I think it would not have been diffi
cult with night glasses to see them. The nights
were pretty clear there for some time. I In
variably looked for the pickets befora going
below."
"Did you designate the formation of tha
squadron under your command prior to June*
1, when blockading oft Santiago as a line of
battler'
"Yes. I was hi lino of battle all the time,
in column." â¢ ' /
"Did you discuss with any. of .yoor captains
the plan of battle as outlined in. your evidence
In chief and the changing from column to tine
of battle?"
"I do not really remember tha full extent
of the discussion, but It was a general ex
planation of the plan. . Why I say that is
because Captain Evans said to me: Then you
propose to charge Into the entrance.' and that
would lead me to Infer that therÂ» must hava
been some explanation, because that was tha
purpose. If we were in line or column of bat
tle off the harbor and the enemy should appear
a wheel would bring us In line directly for
them and- another wheel would bring us east
or west if -they turned east or west.,, .That oc
curred to nje as a very facile and moblla move
ment. My scniadron was small' and I had to
keep It together as a unit."
At this point Admiral Schley complained of
sensitiveness In. his. throat and tha court ad
journed ten minutes in advance of tha' usual
time until 11 o'clock to-morrow. â¢â¢ -\u25a0

THE SAN CALL, WEDNESDAY; OCTOBER 30, 1901;
Captain Lemly â And you were satisfied from
these, without â¢ taking any steps whatever to
ascertain If this order or 'these reports were
correct?
"I ascertained for myself through the me
dium that the department had placed there to
"In your testimony you say that you did not

further direction. Am, I right?"
"Yes." " " -. .
"Upon receipt of the Instructions did you
not, nevertheless, leave your station?"
"Yes, I did, for these reasons: First, because
Captain Slgsbee, a scout placed In front of
Santiago harbor, Informed me that he did not
believe the Spanish fleet was there; second,
because Nunez, the pilot, told me he did not
believe the enemy's fleet could enter the har
bor; third, the order No. 7, with the accom
panying memorandum In which Admiral Samp
son minimized the Importance of this squadron
being there and the fact that the department's
telegram which reached me on May 27 was so.
ambiguous in its terms. It authorized me to
coal at Gonalves, Hay tl. or at Cape Cruz, Gon
aives, being to the eastward, and knowing that
Admiral Sampson was at Bay Francis, In the
Bahama channel to the north, it occurred to me
that if the Spanish squadron were extant the
proper strategical move was to go to tne west
ward and not the eastward. I was authorized
in the same telegram to move as far west as
Cape Cruz, provided coaling had ''been found
p osslble there. I did not go to Cape Crua
within eighty miles, I think. Now those were
the influencing, and the operating motives. I
felt that the move west was strategically the
proper one, with- a determination to coal as
quickly as possible, i and that the efficiency of
any squadron as a unit was only equal to the
efficiency of the coal supply of . the slowest
one that composed It. - These were the mo
'tives which caused that movement. The . am
biguity of the telegram from, the department,
I think. Is manifest almost at once, because It
states first specifically ' that all the depart
ment's Information indicated so and so. That
Is that the Spanish fleet was still at Santiago.
It pointed out a place which at that time was
not accessible, and. lastly, it looked to me to
determine and report whether the enemy was
In port or not. Those were the "Influencing mo
tives."
The Disobedience Charge.
,. In . reply to a question the witness saM that
the Merrimac had signaled her accident on
May 26, at 6:15 of that date and that at that
time he was heading toward Santiago.
Referring to' the beginning of, the westward
movement at that time, Captain 1 Lemly called
Admiral Schley' s attention to the fact he (the
witness) had said in his testimony in chief
I * Â£ s s^ 011 as the sea had calmed down he
had begun to coal, considering himself better
able to Judge than any other officer. Captain
Lemly then had the witness examine the log
of the .Brooklyn for the purpose of bringing
out the fact that during the day of the 27th
the. barometer was rising, .the breeze dying
down and the sea becoming calmer.
â¢Notwithstanding Improved conditions,
did. you not steam twenty-three miles to the
westward that day before attempting to coal?"
After looking .at the log the admiral said
that according to that memorandum he had
b teamed eighteen^milea. Further, the admiral
stated that they had been obliged to steam
three or four knots farther than they needed
to. overtake the Yale, which did not respond
to y the Brooklyn' s . signal.
In what way did Lieutenant Southerland
make known his regret that he had to leave
the squadron for coal?"
"By, megaphone."
'You say he did not protest against leaving
the squadron?" - "
\u25a0 .'.'SJo... he., did . not. - Such --* protest would
have been so extraordinary that I would have
remembered it, I am sure. I do not remem
ber, as he testified, that he begged to coal
alongside. That would not have been pos
sible. I -was : principally directed by the mo
tion of Ida vessel."
your captains while making thia passage from
Clenfuegos to'Santlag.o \u25a0 In regard to the look
out for the Spanish -fleet?" -
"I did not give any special instructions. They
had their general instructions." '
.."Referring, to the ''Adula, which Captain Cook
said he boarded as a -suspicious craft, do you
know she -was afterward captured and con
demned-as a prize?" .'-,-.
"I do not kriowwhether It was the same ves
sel or, not: I: never saw her -afterward. There
certainly mas nothing to me In the examina
tion of her that Indicated she was a suspicious
ship. She was duly Certified by our State De
partment to enter, the port, of Cienf uegos."

with water, When did you learn this?" .

to differentiate what I knew then and what 1 1

read a signal to this effect from the Eagle
to the Brooklyn, but In the Brooklyn" \u25a0 log the
answer was recorded in reply to the Brook
lyn's questions as to how much coal the Eagle
had for steaming at ten knots: "Nine days at
ten knots." Captain Lemly then read the coal
report of the fleet -for May 26. showing that
the Eagle on that day reported to the Brook
lyn that she had twenty-eight tons.
"Can you state whether the squadron made
better speed after the Eagle was sent away?"
"You asked me that question yesterday and
I eaid I could not recall. The wind had gone

General Greeley recommends i an : Inter

lations for cables. Conc4i*iiÂ»nqr "experi-'
mental work he says:
. In wireless telegraphy., thft signal corps has
perfected Its own system, .which was the first
onÂ«* ever successfully operated in the United
States, on September 30, 1899, between Fire
Island and Fire Island lightship, a distance
of. ten .miles.. There are now la successful
operation two stations . in San Francisco har
bor, one at Fort .Mason and another at , A1-"
cat raz Island. Arrangements have - been made
for the establishment of stations in the Phil
ippines \u25a0 at suitable points. . . The chief signal
officer adhered to the opinion that this system
has its limitations, which are' not entirely de
pendent on distance. -Â» â . 'f
General â¢ Greely, ln r recommending a
Pacific cable, says: : \u25a0;.'â¢'
It is only a matter of time when Luzon shall
be' connected with Japan 'and, Tonquln" and
the Chinese empire. - The Philippine ; Islands
are now only accessible \u25a0 telegraphically i over a
short cable of about 600 miles > of the Eastern
Extension Company between Manila and Hong
kong.,' -OV -â¢-\u25a0\u25a0: ":â¢ :"\u25a0.*â¢ â¢';;\u25a0': v . \u25a0'\u25a0 'â¢'-". \u25a0' ;-â¢ ',
,The experiences of the "War Department in
connection with the relief of - the legation - at
Peking show, clearly \u25a0â¢ the .tremendous disad
vantage under which the United States would
labor without its . own cable \u25a0 facilities in case
of an extended war in the- East. J An Eastern
Trans-Pacific cable Is a military and commer
cial necessity if American interests are to. be
safeguarded in Asiatic regions. Such a cable,
while.of great value militarily, will especially
further industrial interests and facilitate | com
mercial \u25a0 operations. .-As i It is officially known
that \u25a0 an . American \u25a0 cable can , only ; enter \u25a0 Japan '
from the east and not ' from Japan, - China or
the/Philippines, the only possible route is that
already recommended to. Congress by the Presi
dent, via Hawaii and Guam. â¢.
If the officers and men of the elgnal corps
had struggled only against, the. natural dis
advantages they were under, their work In the
Philippines would have commanded commenda
tion; but to this must be added the extreme
difficulties arising 1 from the practically con
stant efforts of the Insurgents' to destroy In
dispensable, means of Inter-communication. In
the region southeast of Laijuna de Bay, Santa
Cruz to .Antlmono and thence to the head of
the Gulf of Ragay, the Insurgent troops had
caused no end of trouble and annoyance, . not
only by the cutting of the. wire,' but by the
removal or destruction of considerable stretches
of line. The commanding- officer at Santa Crua
Informed me that necessity | had caused him to
furnish every repair I â¢ party â¢ with â¢ at i least a
mile of wire, as at least that amount was taken
away at each break. Destruction of - sections
of two, three or five . miles of wire was not
unusual, but the climax "was reached in the
total : destruction of thirty-eight miles of line,
every insulator, being: broken,' every bracket
destroyed or removed, 'every pole cut down and
the entire wire carried away. ' , . , .
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.â General Gree
ly, chief signal officer, in his annual re
port says the signal corps should be In
creased to meet present \u25a0 requirements.
There have been constructed 336 miles of
telegraph line in .Alaska and arrange
ments have been made with the Canadian
Government to use its lines, to Alaska.
The operations of the corps* in the Philip
pines -have been very extensive, there
having been 4851 miles of telegraph line,
an increase pi 2054 during the year. .The

kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.
Neuralgia, nervousness, headache, puffy or dark circles under the eyes, rheuma-
tism, a dragging pain or dull ache in the back, weakness or bearing down, sensa-
tion, profuse or scanty supply of urine, with strong odor, frequent desire to pass It
night or day, with scalding or burning sensationâ these are all unmistakable signs
of kidney and bladder trouble. .
If there is any doubt in your mind as to your condition, take from your urine on
rising about four ounces, place It in a glass or bottle and let It stand twenty-four
hours. -If on examination it Is milky or cloudy, if there is a brick-dust settling, or
If small particles float about in it, your kidneys are in need of Immediate attention.
Other symptoms showing that you need Swamp-Root are sleeplessness, dizzi-
ness, irregular heart, breathlessness, sallow, unhealthy complexion, plenty of ambi-
tion, but no strength. . .
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and Is used in the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by physicians In their private practice, and is taken by doctors them- .
selves, because they recognize In it the greatest and most successful remedy that
science has .ever been able to compound.
If you are already convinced that Swamp-Root is what you need, you can pur-
chase the regular fifty-cent and one-dollar bottles at the drug stores everywhere.

T* J 2Â£ n rft l la . m ' Republican nominee for
Public Administrator, ought : to be sun
ported hy the- voters. It is true that
Thomas D. Riordan, chairman of the con
vention, is making a light against Mr
Farnham, but this opposition is not
grounded principle. The position of
attorney for tha Public Administrator is
oiie that Mr. Riordan- aspires to flu
Frank McGowan also has aspirations for
the. same position. It appears that Mr
Farnham declined to; engage "In advance
of the election the services of Mr Rlor
dan; therefore, the latter bolted the nom
ination of a convention over " which lie
yrsM elected to preside. As party issues
cut no figure in this local campaign .the
bolt i Is not E serious, f If there were' ten

Gentlemen,' we appeal" to you as citizens, as
men havlnsr the good of San . Francisco at
heart, to vote for us,- not because we are Dem
ocrats or Republicansr-there is.no such ques
tion lnvolved-*-but simply because we represent
horiesty and independence â independence, gen
tlemen, that ls the first requisite, because we
represent | independence In public life. (Great
applause.) .. . \u25a0 i /â¢â¢'â¢*'
THe Issue Don-Partisan.
It* tvll parties, gentlemen. In days' gone by,
there have been discontented spirits, there has
been irritation, there hav^e been Just- charges
from one., party against another .party, but,
gentlemen,' we insist now that these things are
passed and crone forever. That v we stand here
as representatives of the whole , people of San
Francisco, as the plain people of San Fran
cisco, as the representatives of the . common
people . of San Francisco,' and i after all, gen
tlemen, : the place where the plain, : the pom
mon people of San Francisco and of the United
States belong . is - beneath the 1 flag ot Democ
racy. (Applause.) ' <<* \u25a0 - . '
I say - that, not at all ; losing sight . of the
issue that I .have, presented > as non-partisan.
I say that because every man in this audience
knows that the Republican Convention did not
represent the Republican ' party. ? Every man
knows I that the ; Republican Convention : was
nothing else than a coterie of corporations and
coterie of bosses. You ; know, gentlemen, that
in \u25a0 that convention I districts refused | to votd
when j called â¢ upon to vote because they knew;
they could not cast their vote with Independ
ence and ' honesty " : and If they could not \u25a0 dÂ»
that they . refused - to vote' at all. Ask your
Republican friends. Ask those Who controlled
the Republican Convention. ,. "Was it a free, in
dependent,. outspoken ; convention? 'You 'know,
gentlemen, = who controlled * it. . -ThÂ« people Â«f
San: Francisco are called upon to choose! now.
The Parting of tlte Ways.
.They. are, at the parting of the ' ways. They;
have had in the last. two years honest men in
office."'. There; can r . be. no: denial : of. that' fact.-;
The* leading representative upon the Republican
ticket has: told you so. ':â¢*\u25a0;-\u25a0â¢ .. '. 'â¢. \u25a0 -.' ' : ' v -l-"-.
â¢ Gentlemen, you are called upon -to- choose
then between a set of officials who-have served
years and years. Every man who . owned a
dollar's worth of property in San Francisco
at that time had the value of that dollar cut
In half by that agitation. Don't forget that,
gentlemen, when you come to vote at this elec
tion. Don't forget that to Kearneyism in San
Francisco was due many a foreclosure Of a
mortgage on a homestead,' many a suspension
of a business, many an assignment and many a
failure, j . ' . .'.'"': '-;â¢
A similar Issue to a' great extent Is presented
row before you. â¢ Tou are Invited to do that
which If you own property will depreciate the
value of that property by 60 per cent. Every,
man who haa a dollar's worth of property in
vested in San' Francisco must know that the
election of a ticket i which typifies discontent
and agitation means stagnation 1 n San 'Fran
cisco, means that San Francisco will be stigma
tized throughout \u25a0 the United States aa a city
where it ls unsafe for capital to go,, where men
will not be protected if they invest their capi
tal there, and where you will be confronted by
an agitation and a discontent which* may ulti
mately end , In the confiscation of any property
that you may invest in there. . ;. :'. . \u25a0. \u25a0 .
Gentlemen, another thing. | Remember that in
days, gone by men have been driven from this
city, men of wealth; men 'of standing have been
driven from this city by Jealousy and by. hyper
crltlclsm and by discontent. We want = every
body who has been born' here and . made hia
money here and lived here as an honest citizen
to remain here : and j die ' here . and spend ; his
money here and help make San Francisco j the

IP 1 enthusiasm during 'a. campaign Is
any criterion to support in the vot
ing booth, the election of Joseph. S.
Ttobin to the chief magistracy of San
Francisco ls assured. In whatever
district the Democratic candidate for
Mayor has appeared, to whatever class of
audience he has spoken, the result has
always been the same. He has appeared
before audiences' coldly critical, he has
appeared before audiences prepared to rid
icule him. In every instance his frank,
strateht-froxn-the-shoulder, businesslike
manner ot discussing- the Issues of the
campaign and Btatingr bis attitude toward
them has turned criticism to open admira
tion and ridicule to warmest praise.
Conservative business men have become
lnfvsed with the candidate's enthusiastic
advocacy of thing's honest and clean. He
has inspired the workingmen with a be
lief in the sincerity of his declarations.
He has made friends wherever he has ap
peared, among men of all classes and of
every shade of political belief and as the
campaign progresses he is making more
friends for himself and the cause of clean,
honest, businesslike city government.
Tobin spent yesterday in a vigorous can
vass of the business districts. He was
at the Builders' Association on Bush street
and at tbe Builders' Exchange on the cor
ner of New Montgomery and Mission
etreets. During: the afternoon he made
the round of the Insurance offices and last
evening addressed three enthusiastic
meetings in three widely separated . dis
tricts. \u25a0'-\u25a0 ':'" '\u25a0' '-
He spoke first at Masonic pall. Four
teenth street and Railroad avenue. In
spite of the fact that the two other polit
ical meetings were advertised in the same
district and that he had appeared but a
few evenings before in this same hall,
there was an enthusiastic audience awalt-
Ir^g him. Richmond Hall,: on F*ourth av
enue and Clement street, was crowded to
the doors and at Saratoga Hall, 828 Geary
street, where he spoke last, hia reception
was such as has been accorded to no
other candidate during the campaign.
His address at Masonic Hall was as
follows: â¢'â¢â¢\u25a0.V^v' - : \u25a0 :
Keystone of Constitutional Arch.
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: From
the Inspiring and elevating words, "All men
are born free and equal," this country sprang
Into existence. Consider the words, ladles and
gentlemen; they are not "some men," a par
ticular class and proportion, a particular caste
of society, but. the words are "All men are
born free and equal." That is the keystone In
the arch, the constitutional arch upon which
this country rests. "All men are born free and
equal." In this city to-day, ladies and gen
tlemen, there is a ticket appealing to you lor
votes \u25a0which is In direct contradiction, in direct
opposition to that principle. The theory | upon
which that ticket ls based ls that all men are
cot free and equal; that all men are not equal,
because in making their nominations for office
they restricted their officials to one caste of
society, because some men are fit to be upon
this ticket, because they occupy a particular po
sition upon the Etaga of life. Other men are not
fit to be upon this ticket, not because they are
not honest men, not because they are not hon
orable men, not because they are not good citi
zens, but simply because they do not belong
to that- caste of society.
Gentlemen, remember It welL When the Dec
laration of Independence was signed the men
who created this country said. "All men are
equal." When the Labor Union ticket was
â¢placed In the field the men who created that
ticket said to the citizens of San Francisco,
"All men are not equal." That some men have
& right to official positions In this city and in
the government of this country, but others have
not, though they pay their taxes. Though they
discharge their duties as citizens In every re
spect, they are not fit for a place in the gov
ernment of this country because they do not
belong to a particular caste of society.
Issue That Confronted Forefathers. :
Gentlemen, the greatest conflict through
which this country ever passed was In defense
of the proposition that "all men are born free
and equal." The blood of this country was
shed In torrents, the money of this country
was poured out in an avalanche, the citizens
of this country piled their skulls mountain
high upon the valley of the Mississippi and
upon the valleys of all the Southern States in
defense of the proposition that "all men are
born free and equal. Abraham Lincoln, one
of our martyred Presidents, gave up his life
in defense of the proposition that all men are
equal.
Gentlemen, tbe Issue confronts you to-day as
it confronted our forefathers when they stood
upon the field of battle with their bayonets
fixed in the face of their .brother foe. The
same proposition exactly confronts you now.
It confronts you in another form, but it is
there Just the same. I say to you any ticket
that appeals to you simply because it is made
up of a distinct class of society, of a distinct
clique in society, is an un-American ticket. It
is not based upon American principles; it is
not based upon the principles that actuated
our forefathers, who laid the cornerstone of
this country. (Applause.)
Gentlemen, this may appear to you to be a
false issue, but do not mistake It. Every think
ing man will epeak to you as I have spoken to
you. If this country Is to. become the battle
field upon which the classes will meet in po
litical conflict, one party representing one ele^
nient : of society, another party representing
another element of society, that conflict' Is
bound to result in the destruction and the dis
integration of the greatest democracy that has
ever existed. The only danger. 1 the only pos
sible rock upon which the snip of state may
strike, is the possibility of conflict between
class against class, and any ticket that appeals
to you as honest, patriotic citizens simply be
cause it represents one distinct class of society
makes to you a-false appeal, makes to you an
appeal to which you ehould tum a deaf ear
more particularly In the case of an election
affecting only municipal offices. Municipal
government consists eimpjy in keeping in
P K r Â°J der ?. ur 2 wn n Â°uÂ«*old. It ls ag
much a domestic affair, it ls as much an un
partisan affair, as the keeping in order of your
own cottage or your own house.
Were Given Fair Hearing.
TO>y should >*Â° n People here in the outlyinj?
districts vote for one ticket more than another'
Every householder In the outlying distrlctl of
San Francisco owes a debt of gratitude t^the
Democratic party (applause) for the simpleTrea
son. If for no other, that they have reduced the
bill this year Is reduced exactly so many dol
lars or eo many cents as the case may bÂ£ and
after all. ladles and gentlemen, municipal gov
ernment is a case-nothing more-of dollars and
cents. Remember when you get your tax bills
that your taxes have" been reduced by the
Democratic party for the last two years and
as men who are willing- to repay a debt of
Bratifude which they owe to officials who have
made that reduction, you are bound to vote
for the Democratic party. (Applause) Re
member .another thing: These things may a - D
peal to you. Remember that when the men
from the outlying districts appeared before thÂ«
Board of Supervisors and asked to have the
pound limits extended to the coutity line they
were given a fair hearing. They were allowed
to present their proofs, and don't forret sren
tlemen. that lft the face of that hearing and in
the face of the presentation of your proofs and
your evidence a pull was exerted against you,
the Fame pull which has proven bo potent when
exerted in other Boards of Supervisors. But
that pull was powerless In this board, as pow
erless as- every other pull that has been ex
erted In that board. Your case was decided
upon its merits, and upon Its merits it was de
cided In your favor. )
The candidate upon the Republican ticket
said a few months ago that this Is the best
Board of Supervisors that has ever existed in
San Francisco. Gentlemen, remember . that Is
the testimony of the leading candidate upon
the opposing ticket. But now he comes out
and saye that the reason this board was bet
ter than any other board, was because the law
made them better. (Laughter.) Gentlemen,
the argument Is absolutely- without founda
tion. Every moralist, every political economist,
knows that a man cannot be made good by
law. It has been proven' ae years and years !
Ia Baa Francisco have fipwn past tfiat op XWt*^
ter how honest, how upright, the law. if you
have not eot honest officials, tho result will
be dishonesty. So that to say that the offi
cials In office in the Board of Supervisors
chamber were honest because the law maaÂ«
them honest is â¢ an absurd argument. Those
men discharged their duty- to yvn. gentlemen,
in lowering your taxes, in extending your pound
limits and in a great many other ways, and
do not forget, gentlemen, when It comes the
proper time to cast your voteâ do not. forget,
gentlemen, that you owe something- to the
Democratic party that has effected this for you.
and nothing to the other two parties . which
claim your vote. (Applause.)
At Fourth avenue and Clement streets
an enthusiastic audience awaited the can
didate for Mayor, who spoke as follows:
Keynote of Campaign.
Mr. Chairman, Ladie3 and Gentlemen: There
Is neither Democracy nor Republicanism In tne
operation and control of theÂ«Geary-street fran
chise. That Is the keynote of this campaign.
I have come here this. evening to address you,
not as the representative of a political PaÂ«y,
but as a citizen desirous of effecting something
for the better government of San Francisco.
You people In the outlying districts \u25a0 of San
Francisco are directly interested in its pros
perity and-Â«rrowth- The suburbs of San Fran
clseo for their future prosperity are dependent
upon an Increase of population, and if tne gov
ernment of San Francisco is such that tne
water rates are higher, the facilities for light
ing poor, the streets dilapidated, the overflow
ing population, will be sent to Oakland. Ala
meda, to San Mateo and elsewhere.
There is one question that has already been
solved to a great extent, and that is as. to
the closing of the cemeteries. It was not
solved until after a long struggle. In that
Question was there anything present' but the
Issue of good citizenship? Was there anything
of Democracy or Republicanism in that? It
was simply a question of the better govern
ment of San Francisco, of the increased fa
cilities for lngrees and egress to San Fran
cisco from this part of the peninsula. It was
the question of removing a bulwark which pre
vented the proper growth of San Francisco In
this direction, and, gentlemen, remember that
the present Board of Supervisors solved that
difficulty in your fax'or; remember that you
attended there through your representatives,
presented your case, and upon the evidence
submitted the case was decided In your favor.
No Boss Influence.
Remember that this Board of Supervisors was
subject to no pull, was under the thumb of no
corporation, was influenced by no boss, j It was
simply an honest aggregation of honest men,
and that is the issue again presented to you
in this campaign. (Applause.)
The leading representative upon the Repub
lican ticket said the other evening that the
present Board of Supervisors was the best
board that San Francisco has ever seen. â¢ He
said that a few months ago in the Palace
Hotelâ I heard him say it. In explanation of
that now, which was an honest statement and
a truthful statement,- in explanation of that
now he says that they were honest because
the charter made them honest Gentlemen,
you kngw that this cannot be so. Men are
not honest because the letter of the law re
forms or purifies their character, hut because
they have honest hearts and honest characters.
You know that no matter If you piled the
statute books mountains high, you cannot make
one honest man.
Wells' Argument Puerile.
\u25a0 The argument that the present' Board of
Supervisors was honest because the char
ter made them honest is puerile and su
perficial. When the leading light upon the
Republican ticket said that this was the best
Board of Supervisors we ever had he did not
then contemplate the fact that he would prob
ably meet them upon the stump. He is now
endeavoring to explain away an honest state
ment of a patent fact. But, gentlemen, it is
too late. He has spoken the truth, and you,
gentlemen,- will pront by his advice, take him
at his word, and vote for that Board of Su
pervisors again. (Applause.) . -
The Geary-street franchise, he also says, is
not a question for decision at this time â that
the people will decide It hereafter; that he is
willing to leave It to the people. Well, gentle
men, why not submit it to the people now?
(Applause.) Let us submit It at this election.
(Applause.) If he has any opinion upon the
subject let him state it now upon the stump
and let the people decide upon the 5th of No
vember, whether he Is right or wrong. He is
afraid to meet the Issue. He says the charter
does not compel him to meet the. issue. I. say
the charter does compel him to meet the issue.
The charter is pledged to the acquisition â¢ and
ownership of public utilities. You, gentlemen,
every man of you who voted for the charter of
the city and county of San Francisco- and
made that charter its fundamental law, pledged
his citizenship that the acquisition and control
of public utilities was a good thing for the city
and county of San Francisco.
Submit It Novr.
And If the opposing candidate wants- to sub
mit it to the vote of the people of the city and
county of San Francisco, now ia the time to
do it. We won't wait for another election; let
us submit it now.
The Democratic platform has taken the stand
that tbe acquisition and control of the Geary
street franchise is a good thing for the city.
The Republican platform Ignores It and re
pudiates it. You, gentlemen, from this dis
trict, sent- a letter to the Republican conven
tion asking them to put a plank In the plat
form pledging the party to the acquisition and
control of the Geary street franchise, and the
letter was Ignored and thrown aside. Gentle
men, an issue like this must be met. If you
nominate, or if you elect men who are indif
ferentâI won't say opposed, but I merely say
Indifferentâ to the acquisition and control of the
Geary street franchise, once they get in office
they -will balk you and you can never submit
It to the vote of the people at the next munici
pal electlon< They will take advantage' of
every technicality, they will take advantage of
every resource that the law affords them, and
under the advice of astute corporation coun
sel those resources, those subterfuges, will be
many.
That question will never be submitted to you
If you elect men who upon tho stump say at
this time that this question Is not an issue,
whereas the charter says that the citizens of
San Francisco are . committed to the acquisi
tion of public utilities. . â. . -
We submit to you that we stand for the fun
damental law as we find it. We meet the is
sue and respectfully submit that we are enti
tled to your suffrages in preference to those
who have not only failed to meet the Issue, but
when confronted with it have stepped aside
and ignored it. . Gentlemen, I thank you. (Ap
plause.)
The meeting at Saratoga Hall was prob
ably one of the most enthusiastic of the
campaign. . The audience greeted Tobin
with cheers and at the conclusion of his
vigorous address every man rose to his
feet and cheered the candidate. The au
dience was representative of . the best
class of local citizenship. There were men
of every political faith and from, every
walk of life, all inspired with the same
spirit that has been the keynote of To
bin's entire campaign. ' The candidate
spoke as follows:
A Business Proposition.
Mr. Chairman, Ladles and Gentlemen: -I de- 
slre to thank you for the cordiality of this re
ception and to apologize for having: delayed
tbe meeting- to auch a late hour. I have been
compelled to go to various places in the city
and have been unable to get here sooner. <
I am endeavoring, ladles and gentlemen, . to
confine the Issue in this campaign . to princi
pally one proposition. - That - point has been
raised bo often and , your attention has been
directed to it so often that it . Is not for me
to repeat It now. It Is simply for me to re
iterate It for a moment, . simply to state that
it Is a business proposition. It is the proper
government of your own household. With you
all, ladles and â¢ gentlemen, municipal : govern
ment consists In each man taking proper care
of his own domestic circle, keeping \u25a0 In ; proper
order his own household. Local questions - are
the only questions presented in this campaign.
The object of every citizen who votes at this
election is or should be the future prosperity,
the. future improvement and the future beauti
fying and keeping clean of the city and county
of San Francisco. .'..\u25a0' â¢ - . \u25a0 .

THE Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs, at Its meeting
Saturday night, appointed a com
mittee to interview the three can
didates for Mayor in regard to
their attitude in regard to the Southern
Pacific double irack through the Mission.
The committee has issued the following
statement of their work and the inter
views secured:
The" committee of the Federation of the Mis
sion Improvement Clubs, pursuant to the In
structions received from the club . Saturday
evening last, called upon the several candi
dates for Mayor to learn their sentiments and
feeling In regard to the granting to the South
ern Pacific Company of permission to lay
a double-track steam railroad through the Mis
sion district. :. . '
The first of the candidates seen- was. Mr.
Tob'n, who" said among other things;
' "1 promise to, use every legal means In- my
power, if elected Mayor, to cause to ' be re-,
moved the present tracks of the Southern Pa
cilic Company used as a steam railway pass
ing through the Mission district- and to compel
the said company-' to use its right of way -on
the bay shore/ and also to ' faithfully execute
the resolution of the Board of Supervisors re
quiring the removal I of the Bald tracks from
their -present position." \u25a0. \u25a0 .
The committee next called upon and inter
viewed Mr.. Wells, who said:
"I have thought myself that those tracks
should be removed, and that they have out
lived their time and should be taken up; that
ia my conviction. I do not. want to make any
pledges. -I do not Intend to Veto' any order
where the people are interested, that ia aa
against the people. There are a great many
things to be cbnsldered.and when a case comes
\u25a0up before me I want to be free. \u25a0 My conviction
as a citizen is that those steam car tracks
should be taken up. I have felt so' for a
long time, and I thought all the time that ths
railroad company Intended to do It. ' I know
Mr. Lynch. I think all my property down there
near Bay "View â¢ would be benefited if they
went that way. He tells me it Is their In
tention to have their road removed over there.
Says He Is Free From Influence.
"I don't think it Is . possible to get fifteen
Supervisors to be in opposition to the wishes
of the people; that 13 â¢ my flnn conviction.
When you get the consent of fifteen Supervisors
it | seems - to me that that Is the wish of the
people. :They come from all parts of the city,
and they are supposed to represent the wishes
of the people. In a case of that kind, if I be
came convinced that It was against the will
of the people I would want to interfere. I can
assure you that I am Just as free, as far as I
know, from any Influence of the railroad as any
of you gentlemen, and in all my public acts
I wish to be In accord with the people who are
Interested. * My conviction is that those tracks
should be removed from ' the Mission, and haa
been for some. time. It is evsry little while,
there- Is some one -Killed. Now, gentlemen, I
shall bo Just as much interested in the fight
as If I owned property and lived there. When
It comes 'before me I shall endeavor, to act as
near right as I possibly can. for the people. I
am under no obligation that I know of to the
railroad people.. They 'have never Insinuated
any wish) that I should bÂ« interested for them.
I never, saw Mr. Herrin but once in my life,
anl on that occasion he did not ask anything
from \u25a0 me. â¢ â¢ If I \u25a0 am elected Mayor . I shall be
interested ' In the affairs : of the peoples,- and I
shall give these matters the same attention as"
If I was a Judge on the bench."
Wells Refuses to Give Pledge.
The committee then '.requested. Mr.- "Wells to
give â¢. them an ; assurance In writing, and ', Mr.
Wells said:,:. : V . '.-..:\u25a0' ... *-...â¢...' :,
\u25a0-:. "I do not think any of you should ask me
In a case of this kind, to give ' a pledg-e. I do
not believe the railroad is. entitled to any fur
ther , privileges; I "am 'firmly of 'that opinion;
they should have no further privileges In thÂ«
Mission district."
The committee then called upon Mr. Schmlts,
who stated: "I am opposed to the granting to
the Southern Pacine Company of any mom
rights than they at the present time possess.
The said company possesses a franchise to op#
rate a line aloo? the bay shore and they should
not be permitted to operate a road through a
thickly settled portion of the city such aa the
Mission district.- I further belle-re, and If
elected Mayor will promise, that I will compel
the said railroad company, after the said tracks
have been removed, to repair â¢ and put the>
streets in good condition, and not leave thÂ«
same In the condition they have left , Basil
street." - -
Tobin and Schmitz Outspoken, While Wells Thinks
He Is Free From Railroad Influence. â¢
riotlsm of the delegates were not lnvoketl
in the make-up of the ticket. An appeal
for Republicans to give their support to
a ticket produced in this fashion is an in
sult. TJie plain truth Is that Herrin and
Burns fixed up the ticket to protect the
corporations. Money was contributed by
the corporations to hire Democrats to
vote the Republican ticket at the pri
mary election for delegates to the con-
Next Tuesday the voters will be asked
to decide whether the corporations or the
people shall rule the city for the next
two years. Business men of the Repub
lican party cannot afford to vote for men
who will reinstate the old order of mis
rule and extravagance in municipal af
fairs Some good haa been accomplished
vnder the new charter and the reform*
secured should not be surrendered. Re
publican merchants, workingmen and
tcxpaying citizens generally should not
only give their support to Mr. Tobin but
they should devote their time and energy
to the cause of good local government
Rnd help elect the Supervisors on the
ticket which Mr. Tobin heads.
Ashamed of Herrin's Ticket-
It will be observed that the men whey )
.Oght the Republican battles and win thtf-
Republican victories are not shouting ior^
Herrin's ticket. They are heartily
ashamed of the ticket and deplore the
fact that the .silly old gentleman who was
picked out to make the race for Mayor
refers to Herrin as the sole dispenser of
nominations. Just before the recent
change which placed the news columns
of the Bulletin under the business depart
ment a racy Interview with Wells was
published in that Journal.
The nominee balked and threatened to
come off. the ticket because he was not
allowed to name one candidate for Su
pervisor. The scene at the Pleasanton
Hotel was described. Max Goldberg, the
warrant shaver and Wells' confidential
political adviser, was alarmed. In nuj
haste to find Heirln and repeat Wells
threatened revolt he lost his presence ot
mind and hired a carriage to go to Her
rin's house. There was no thought or
hint of consulting Republican leaders or
Republican delegates. "Wells bluntly ac
knowledged that Herrin agreed with him
that B. P. Flint should go on the ticket.
Wells "Would Be Guided by Herrin.
"Wells obviously entertained the notion
that the Republican party of San Fran
cisco is a corporation ot which Herrin Is
the managing director. His election to
the office of Mayor would not change, his
mind In this respect. His recent' public
utterances signify, that whatjnttle mina
he has Is badly confused. His intention*
may be the best in the world, but if In
should be elected Mayor he would be
guided by Herrin and Burns Xo do tb.3
bidding of the corporations Interested In
"municipal .legislation. He fully recognize*
Herrin's hand as the hand that held oat
to him the nomination. What can bÂ«
expected of a Mayor . that talks liks
Wells? If he now recognizes Herrin. as
the boss, wlir he not continue the recog
nition in the Mayor's office if the voters
should foolishly- place him there? Every
sense of duty devolving upon good dtl
ship suggests that Wells should be put
aside. His career of public usefulness
has ended.

THE magnitude of the demon
stration at Metropolitan Tem
ple last night . in favor of
Schmitz for Mayor and the
character of the utterances -made by
the speakers should convince the con
servative and law-respecting citizens
of San Francisco that it is their duty
to ' put aside party preferences and
support Joseph S. Tofcih for Mayor of
San Francisco. The elements of an
archy and industrial disorder are con
centrating to bring- about the election
of a labor candidate. Nominee Schmitz
in effect promises that if elected, the
police shall not protect merchants.
Schmitz will be defeated if the busi
ness men, property, owners and law
abiding citizens generally unite their
forces in behalf of Mr- Tobin's candi
dacy. ; If blind 'partisans, failing to
comprehend the full meaning of the
sentiments expressed at the # Temple
last night, continue to lend their sup
port to Wells and thus divide the
forces of industrial order, the candi
date of the labor agitators may be
elected.
Joseph S. Tobin, nominee for Mayor, is
securing large accessions of support from
conservative Republicans. His election is
now regarded aa certain. The direct, un

BYINGTON CLUB IS FORMED.
A. E. Wray Resigns the Presidency
POLITICS CAUSES A ROW.
of the Barbers' Union.
The political wedge has made a split
in the Barbers' Union. On Monday night
at the regular meeting President A. E.
Wray tendered his resignation as pre
siding officer. The cause which led Pres
ident Wray to step out of the president's
chair was the fact that the union, con
trary to its rules and by-laws, espoused
the cause of Eugene E. Schmitz for
Mayor. President Wray favors the elec
tion of Joseph S. Tobin for the office of
Mayor. This fact dawned upon the minds
of the members of the Barbers' Union
and was considered by its members as
an act of treason on the part of its pre
siding officer. Rather than be placed in
a false position. Mr. Wray tendered his
resignation as president, still retaining
his mtnjbership in the union and reserv
ing his rights as an American citizen to
vote for the best man for the office.
In addition to the resignation of Presi
dent Wray, 250 members withdrew from
the union as soon as it was found that
Schmitz and his followers tried to drag
the Barbers'* Union into class politics.
As soon as President Wray tendered
his resignation there were several mem
bers clamoring on the floor to be heard
requesting him to reconsider his action
and remain as presiding officer, but to all
solicitations he was deaf, as he consid
ered that the usefulness of the Barbers'
Union as a labor organization departed
as soon as it went into politics.
connected with the" recent trouble. There
was nothing about the whole business he
could commend, but, on the contrary, its
pttcr blackness was worthy of the con
demnation of evei-y honest man. He re
ferred to Tobin as the political heir to
Mayor Phelan, to Captain Wittman as a
Judas, and to the Chief of Police as
"Shoot Low Sullivan." Continuing, he
said:
' If you want these things to continue vote for
Tobin. If you want Wittman to be Chief of
Police vote for Welis. (Groans.) Wells is
owned body, soul and breeches by the railway
company. If you elect Wells what will be
come of the Geary-street franchise? It will
be turned over to the railroad company. I tell
you, support the labor ticket! (Cheers.) The
Employers' and the Drgymen's associations say
that the Brotherhood of Teamsters will soon
disband and that Casey will have to look for
another job. I tell you we are here and we
mean to stay. In conclusion I ask you to vote
the labor ticket straight, and give the working
men of San Francisco a new deal.
Brief addresses by William H. Hutten
and'Thomas F. Eaean followed.
Before Eagan had finished his speech
Eugene E. Schmitz appeared on the plat
form. His entrance was the signal' for
a storm of applause, which did not abate
for some minutes. Men got on their
chairs and howled, while others waved
their hats and cheered. It was a demon
stration which proved the popularity of
the labor standard bearer and indicated
beyond question that he will prove a for
midable factor in the great struggle of
Tuesday next.
Schmitz Denies Charges.
When Schmitz was permitted to speak
he thanked his audience for their dem
onstration and said that The Call and
Chronicle would probably say in the
morning that the meeting was poorly at
tended and that it lacked enthusiasm.
This was greeted with applause. Resum
ing, he said:
I have been charged with making a compact
with the. Examiner to place its friends In of
fice. I declare on my honor as a man that "I
have made no compact with any newspaper or
any interests or parties whatsoever. I stand
unpledged. . . .
Tobin says, this is a contest of good citizen
ship and honesty. I accept "this statement" and
in reply will say that my citizenship and hon
esty will compare favorably with Tobin' s.
That is not the Issue. The question is, shall
we elect a Mayor who is dominated by the rail
road company and political bosses? If you
vote for Wells you vote to place the city in
control of the corrupt political bosses and the
railroad company. If you vote for Tobin you
place your seal of approval upon the adminis
tration of Mayor Fhelan and of the corrupt
Board of Public Works. Between the tickets
there is but one road which leads to a brighter
future for the laboring classes, and that road
lies in the labor ticket. (Cheers.)
Mr. Schmitz concluded with an appeal
to the workingmen to vote the labor
ticket straight. He promised if elected
to be Mayor of the whole community and
not of a class. He was wildly cheered
when he said that under his administra
tion no policeman would be allowed to
rfde en trucks.
The meeting closed with three cheers
for Schmitz, Furuseth and the labor
ticket.
.* SA R. WELLS, is beginning to
Â«?\ show the strain of campaigning
jfc=*A both physically and mentally. He
A )\ made two addresses last night,
and both were heavy with piati
tudes. He was to have delivered a third
address at the Potrero, but his managers
thought it would be too much of a strain
on his health, so that district was not
visited by him. The voters of the Potrero
in consequence "will have to be content
with reading what he said at the ether
lialls.
The meeting of the Fortieth District
Republican Club at Franklin Hall, on
Fillmore street, near Bu:5h, -was first on
the itinerary. Mr. Wells arrived early,
accompanied by Sam Shortridge, Lucius
Solomons, J. C. Wilkins, Charles Corey,
Edmund Tauszky and a few other can
didates and- orators. When Mr. Wells ar
rived the small hall was partly filled with
voters. There were fully, as many ladies
in the gallery as there were men down
stairs.
Colonel J. C. Giesting escorted Wells to
the platform. As they proceeded toward
the stage there was considerable hissing.
Cheers were given for Tobin, linally cul
minating in a demonstration for Mr.
Wells. Colonel J. C. Giesting presided
and called the meeting to orcier. After
a song by the Waterman Sisters, entitled,
"I Don't Care if I Never Wake Up," Mr.
Wells arose and made the longest speech
lie has as yet delivered. He spoke as
follows:
Wells' Extraordinary Effort.
Ladies and gentlemen: If there is in this
great Republican district one Republican who
should not vote for me at this coming elec
tion, I do not know what the reason is. I have
always been a Republican. I have always used
my beat efforts in the interest of good govern
ment, and if you should elect me to that great
office I shall feel my responsibility to you. I
shall feel that I must and will do everything
that becomes an honorable gentleman to do in
the interest of the people. It has been said
that I belong to some of these big corporations,
to the money kings, to the bosses, and 1 do
not know what else. I have been charged with
most everything that one can be charged with
as being wrong, not just what it should be,
but I know that those charges are all untrue.
It has been said that I was aÂ»Prohibltlonlst, I
believe. I don't know where they ever got
that from. I certainly never was a drunkard.
I take a glass of beer now and then and a drink
of whisky, and I always keep the finest kind
of liquors in my own house, but I am not a
drunkard. I do not associate with drunkards.
I do not frequent those places with side doors.
I do not go down on the Barbary Coast and tell
them there: "If you elect me I will see that
you will have an open town here; that you can
run all night and do what you have a mind
to. I have been charged with that, even. A
committee visited me not long ago to have me
explain something that I advocated very
strongly in the Legislature. There is one place,
.ladles and gentlemen^ that I have not reached,
yet. It is the Legislature. Now they wish me
to make some pledges regarding this Geary
street franchise. Why, I don't know what
pledge a man can make in that respect. That
is a question that belongs to the people,
not to the Mayor, not wholly to the Supervisors.
The people have something to say about that,
and yet I understand that the. Mayors who
are associated together in some way say they
wish me to define myself upon those questions.
I really cannot understand what they want in
that respect. The charter clearly points out
what to do In that matter, and our platform
upon which I stand clearly defines those ques
tions. But after all, ladies and gentlemen, it
depends upon the man largely, upon what wÂ«)
will do with these \ great public questions. I
have been a business man, a very busy man
with affairs, all my days. I have walked up
rightly. Nobody charges me with any bad
faith. One place downtown I was in business
thirty-five years. I visited that place to-day,
put in a whole afternoon round among my
old acquaintances, and it was a pleasure. I
was met with such cordiality, from working
men coming from all around in every direction
to see me; shook hands with me; recognizing
me as a man that had been the workingman's
friend for many years. I had been charged
with being opposed to the eight-hour law and
other ways, not a friend to the common peo
ple. That is all untrue. Years ago I used to
run my planing mill ten hours. I paid large
wages. I reduced the hours, and up to the
last day I ran my mill I paid my men the
same wages I paid them twenty-five years ago
It Is not pleasant, my friends, for me to make
all these explanations. It would rather seem
that I was on the defensive. That is not th<Â»
case. Those who know me best know that I
have no occasion to make any apologies. La
dies and gentlemen, I thank you for this re
ception.
Visits the Colored Voters.
At the meeting of the Afro-American
League at Apollo Hall Mr. Wells selected
John Brown as his topic. He reached
the hall about 10 o'clock, and as the
chairman had thrown out hints that there
was something good' to eat in another
room Mr. Wells cut his remarks short
He said:
My friends: I have often wondered why any
intelligent man should not be a Republican,
and above all I have wondered why every col
ored man should not be a Republican. I know
of none .that is not, I am glad to say The
Republican party commenced with . Abraham
Lincoln; and the colored man, as you know
owes much to Abraham Lincoln. I was brought
up in that part of the country where they used
to pass colored men from the South to Canada
I was in that Garrett Smith country. I was
born at the foot of .the Adirondack Mountainsâ
those great mountains in New 'York, in Eight
of the grave where rest the ashes of John
Brown. At his head is a great granite bowl
der that will stay so long as this world exists.
John Brown's memory will last aa long as
that granite bowlder; that great act of John
Brown, who gave up. his life, as he believed
in the interest of the colored man. And now'
my friends. I don't know as you care to hear
about the issues., as they call it. All the issues
you care about Is a good government, and has
not the Republican party always srlven you a
good government? Don't you feel that you are
safer in the hands of the Republican party
that party which has always brought about
those great Improvements â those great issues
for the benefit of mankind? The party" of
progress? The honorable partyâ the Republi
can party. As I said before, gentlemen I be
lieve every one of you are going to vote the
Republican ticket this year. I think you will
make no. mlFtake if you do ps I shall do and
vote that ticket from top to bottom.
S. M. Davidson, president of the league
presided, and speeches were made bv
Rev: Dr. Brown, pastor of ZIon Methodist
Episcopal Church; Harry Baehr. Charles
H. Stanyan, Thomas Collins. Dr C A
Glover, Dr. J. H. Kelley of the Third

J. M. Wilkins. '
fourth District was held last evening !n
"Washington Square Hall and a Tobin
Club was organized amid, enthusiasm. One
hundred and twenty-six signed
the roll and each grave his pledge to work
earnestly for the election of Joseph S. To
bin for Mavor. .
IT was distinctively an aggregation cf
hardy sons of toil that greeted the
Union Labor candidates in Metropoli
tan Hall last evening. That the work-
ers, who filled the hall to overflowing.
were most earnest in their support of the
labor ticket and all that unto It apper
tains was evidenced by the tremendous
applause each telling point made by the
various speakers <â¢ evoked.
It was Just such a mass-meeting of par
tlsans as would lead the student of eco
nomics to the conclusion that a newly
bora party/ born as the Union Labor
party was born, is a highly significant
event fraught with danger to the old-lme
organizations.
The Wells 'supporters in the audience
saw in the spirited enthusiasm of â¢ this
labor gathering signs of hopeless defeat,
while those who are aiding in the elec
tion of Tobin realized that unless Repub
licans and Democrats combined on the
latter the election of Eugene E. Schmitz
and his following of labor candidates
seems to be an absolute certainty.
It was S:20 o'clock when Chairman de
Succa.: followed by Andrew Furuseth,
Michael Casey and some twenty labor
candidates appeared on the platform. The
delegation was given a rousing reception,
in which men and women joined with a
will. Mr. de Succa was briefly intro
duced as the president of the evening.
De Succa made a brief address of ac
ceptance and introduced Andrew Furu
eeth as the first speaker of the evening.
When Furuseih advanced some one yelled
for "three cheers for the noblest Roman
of them all." These were given with a
wih and Furuseth began his address with
the statement that the crowd before him
was. the old strike crowd. During the
strike meetings were held to protest
against industrial absolutism. Those held
during the present campaign were a pro
test against political absolutism. Resum
ing he said:
Platform "Written in Blood.
The platform of the Union Labor party is
written in thc blood of workingmtn drawn by
the policemen's clubs during the strike. In
1KC the right of labor to organize for its own
defense was contested and the result was the
birth of the Merchants' Association. Then
came the evolution of industrial absolutism into
political absolutism. It brought about condi
tions which rendered a Coxey's army, walkins
across alkali deserts to civilization, possible.
The Employers' Association controlled the
city during the strike. They dominated the
Mayor and police, and broke heads wherever it
was possible to do so. We went to Commis
sioner Newhall with the request that he bring
the strike to an end. He referred us to the
Mayor, who could do nothing save advise the
strikers to go to work. I do not say Mayor
I'hf- an did not do anything, but I do say he
accomplished nothing.
Some one .hissed at . this, whereupon
Furuseth told the delinquent to "do that
oa election day, as it would be much bet
ter." Furuseth then resorted to dema
gogic vituperation, and for some time he
heaped abuse upon the Employers' As
sociation, which he likened to the "Vene
tian Council of Ten. He thought that if
the laboring men did not cjean out the
stable and give the city of San Fran
cisco a new form of government they de
served to wear the shackles of industrial
slavery with < which banded capital Is
seeking to adorn their shoulders, accord
ing to him.
Kuruseth then called attention to the
:;ttitade of The Call toward labor during
the strike. He declared that its editorials
v ere deliberate lies written for a purpose.
He likened the Employers' Association to
a vamnire which fanned its victims with
Call editorials and prepared them for the
Bar.guinary feast in which the vampire
was to gorge itself with blood. In closing
Furuseth said:
We have come here to ask you to help us to
avert another not improbable strike. There are
mar.y of the Employers' Association who are
not satisfied and who are trying to precipitate
another strike in order that they might enslave
labor the more. It is for you as citizens of
the commonwealth to change existing condi
tions, and by a new form of government cor
rect degrading abuses. It is for you to thrust
asid? the vampire which menaces you, and it
is fcr you to declare by your votes vour abhor
rence of the conditions which have for so long
a time weighed you down.
Casey Criticizes Police.
Michael Casey next took the floor,
amid cries of "Good boy, Mike!" "Bully
boy," and the like. Casey proceeded to
say that the worklngman who did not
vote the labor ticket straight was sadly
forjretful of his duty as a. citizen who
had the welfare of the community at
heart.
Naturally, Casey discussed the strike,
the employers, the police and everything

WHEN the Santa Fe secured terminal facili
ties at Point Richmond it was by many sup
posed to be a temporary expedient, to be
abandoned when adequate yard room and water front
could be secured farther down the bay. This idea
raust now be abandoned. While the Santa Fe may
some time secure convenient landing of its passen
gers in Oakland for the sake of a shorter ferriage to
San Francisco, its landing plant at Point Richmond
is destined to become a permanent commercial and
transportation adjunct to San Francisco: For all
purposes of /direct overland carriage this city is as
much on an island as New York is. The bulk of its
landward traffic must always reach it by ferry, and
the enlarging accommodations on its water front
indicate that its incoming and outgoing commerce,
continental and ocean, is to be by water. The Santa
Fe road at Point Richmond emphasizes the value of
deep water connection immediately with rail trans
portation. Xo expensive mole had to be built and
the cost of continual dredging is avoided. The same
deep water frontage has been sought by the Standard
Oil Company, -which is locating its plant there, and
the more recent purchase of 500 acres on the same
iront by J. P.. Morgan discloses the value put upon
such immediate deep water contact by business men.
The effect upon San Francisco will be beneficial. It
means that this city will transact its business along
the whole eastern shore of the bay, and that its great
est concentration and best development will be where
ship and car can c6me together. All of this business
will be tributary to San Francisco, just as the count
less business establishments on New York Bay, Long
Island Sound and North River are tributary to New
York City. What San Francisco has needed has been
the touch of ship and car. In that respect the Sound
ports have had an advantage oveV us' which they,
have .wisely improved. It is a facility that takes a
burden off commerce. On the Atlantic side of the
continent it has always resulted in the attraction and
concentration of commerce. . Great â¢ sums have been,
expended, as at Galvesion and Savannah, to secure it.
This city is fortunate in having it so near to her
water front and in such easy . touch with . all her
activities. .' \u25a0 â¢ .â¢ ; ' ' ,:'\u25a0\u25a0 ';.'.:\u25a0 -/\.-:. '\f.f.-y 'â¢.;'â¢ ' : ;
Every added facility increases commerce! â¢ Per
haps the constructors of the San Joaquin Valley Rail

that in seeking the Point Richmond terminal they
showed great business foresight. â¢ ' . . â¢ \u25a0
Since the construction of the Central Pacific road,
a vast and valuable enterprise and bold in .its day,
California has had no equally bold and valuable en
terprise until the projectors of the San Joaquin Val
lcy road entered upon their work. Its absorption by
the Santa Fe system completed its efficiency, and
brought the long looked for second transcontinental
line to this city. Those who thought honestly that
one road sufficed for the carriage of our trade can
now witness the interesting spectacle of the two
lines pushed to their utmost capacity to transport it.
Both are enlarging their equipment, their yard room
and all of their facilities, and increase these as they
may, production and the demands. of commerce fol
low closely upon every expansion of accommoda
tions. It is doubtless the fact that if one road only
had been here it would have proved inadequate to
answer the demands upon it ;.->_ i, ';V
So those who looked upon the San Joaquin Valley
project as a mere, ideality, useful only because it re
sponded to a sentiment in favor of a rival road, re
gardlcss of any demand. for it, prove to have been
mistaken. It was not an ideality, but a first-class
commercial reality, in the realization of which com
merce has prospered and both roads have, flourished.
This is the law of commercial action. An addition to
facilities always stimulates their use to an increase
equal to that addition. "Both of our transcontinental
roads-will find this law pushing them for a long time
to come, and the Santa Fe will not soon, be able to
stop the enlargement of its terminal; facilities at Point
Richmond to accommodate its ilocai^ar/d through
traffic, and meet the needs of. such, extensive business
plants as arc foretold by the operations of Morgan
and the Standard Oil. people. 1 ' >

It is not requisite that the Mayor of San Francisco
be an orator, but it is requisite that he be able to talk
coherently. His duties will require him to act' as
spokesman of the city in, receiving distinguished
guests, in receiving the President if he come to Cali
fornia next summer, as has been suggested, and in
welcoming the delegates to important â¢ conventions
that may be held here. While, therefore, a Mayor
need not aim at oratory, he must at least have the fac
ulty .of putting together a half-dozen sentences,
each of which will be intelligible in. itself and
not contradictory to the sentence that' precedes it or
that follows it Were there no other ground for ob
jecting to Mr. Wells,'his speeches alone would prove
him to' be utterly unfit to perform the duties of the
Mayor of- San Francisco. . ' '.v . v
. Mr. Wells has not been called upon to make ah
extempore, speech nor to make an argumentative
speech. The uttermost required of him athis princi
pal mass-meetings has been to speak about five min
utes, and ample time has-been allowed him for prep
aration. Yet, with all that time for preparation, Mr.
Wells has never yet uttered .from the platform as
many as 300 words of lucid and logical meaning. In
one of his short speeches he said that certain issues
,"are momentous,". and in the next breath said a can
didate for Mayor should. not be troubled with such
"petty questions." He began his speech at B'nai
B'rith Hall on Monday evening in this way: "I see
that I have been quoted as making a speech at the
banquet at the Palace Hotel, wherein it is illuminated
with a beautiful portrait! large display type, and as
saying that the present Board of Supervisors is a
good Board of Supervisors, and that in all of my rcsi
dence.here of forty years it is the best.board.I ever
saw." This is a sample of the Wells style of speech.
MR. WELLS' speeches at the more important
political gatherings held by the supporters of
his ticket have been published in full by The
Call, and any one who has had sufficient interest in
his candidacy to read them has found in them ample
evidence upon which to base an estimate of Mr.
Wells' ability to talk coherently for as. much as two
or three minutes at a time. To one phase of those
speeches we desire to direct the attention of the peo
ple of San Francisco, for outside of any question of
policy involved it is a matter.of importance to have in
the Mayor's office a man who can formulate his ideas
with definiteness and express them in x intelligible
English. / - ; :-\u25a0\u25a0' '\u25a0\u25a0'.'\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'.; \ ., '.'':\u25a0'. '\u25a0:/ .\u25a0\u25a0'.'
JUSTICE BREWER of the United States Su-:
premc Court in his address at the recent Yale
festival pointed out the relation of education to
good citizenship and emphasized the responsibility"
of; the. individual to public affairs. Many evils
exist in the social fabric'ancl in government, and they
are sometimes ola. nature that cannot be effectively
reached by the courts. It^depends upon the people
of any given community whether such defects shall
be remedied or left to operate unchecked.
Speaking of the .proper method of dealing with
these pernicious tendencies, the Justice said: "Appeal
must be taken to the great court of public opinion,
whose decrees are irresistible. In that court every
man is counsel and every man is judge.* That court
may not stay .the. movement, but will control it. It
can make the movement with all the wonderful things
attending it subserve the higher thought of en
nobling the individual. Who shall lead and guide in
that court? Not the demagogue appealing for self
ish purposes to ignorance and prejudice. We turn to
the educated lover of his country, the one who be
lieves in her institutions; who would not destroy
but keep pure, and is filled evermore with the thought
that true service of the public is the greatest glory of
the man." â¢
At this juncture in San* Francisco there are many
issues submitted to the tribunal ol'. which Justice
Brewer spoke. Certain grasping corporations, in
alliance with the worst elements of our' politics, are
striving to bring about the election of a Board of
Supervisors that will not only give the. corporations
unfair profits in their dealings 'with the city but will
,opcn the 'town to gambling, . pool-selling, side
entrance saloons and kindred forms of vicei The ap
peal, therefore,, goes to the court in which every man
is a judge. It is made to the intelligent lover of his
country and of his city.
The responsibility of the individual in this case is
not slight. It cannot be shirked by the easy process
of voting a particular ticket because that ticket' hap
pens to, bear the name of the national party to which
the individual belongs. National politics has nothing
to do. with this contest, which is one, of morality
against immorality. It is the duty of every citizen to
weigh the case upon' its merits, to vote for the wel
fare of the city and defeat those who are trying to
loot it' " ; . V,

PROMINENT MEN OP HAWAII
WHO ARE TO THE FORE IN PO
LITICAL AFFAIRS.
HONOLULU, Oct. 22 -The Bulletin
says: "The Independent : Home
Rulers have set their minds on
Robert W. Wllcox as the next
Governor of the Territory of Hawaii and
no one else will they have. The attempt
at substitution for .the recent petition in
favor of .Wllcox and sent to President
Roosevelt of another one in favor of Sec
retary Cooper has been branded by the
party as an attempt on the part of Its
onemies to throw discredit on the Inde
pendent Home Rulers.
"A meeting of the executive committee
of the Home Rulers was held last Thurs
day v night. There were fifty-two mem
bers present, there being but sixty-five
on the committee. This large attendance
was undoubtedly due to the announce
ment that governorship matters would be
discussed. Besides the fifty- two there
were present seven or eight members of
the Legislature. Robert W. Wllcox, Ha
waii's delegate to .Washington, was
iimong those present. ' ;
Your name Asa means a gum, that was used anciently for healing, and so came
to be used as the, designation of a physician â a healer. Now, have you gummed that
Supervisor, ticket because it was nominated last, when you could not have, gummed the
same men had they been nominated first? The people "would like to know how and why
the order in which the nominations were made has affected the fitness of those candidates
whom you would have refused to lead had you seen them first.
Do you know, Mr. Wells, that according to your own statement' of the case jou
were bunkoed by the bosses, who put nvou in the position of leading a ticket sight and
unSeen, and then sprung on you a Supervisor ticket that so nauseated you that you
threatened to throw up your own nomination unless Flint went on? < Now, why Flint?
Was it because you counted noses and reputations on that ticket and decided that Flint
would hold the balance of power between dishonesty and unfitness and fitness and hon
esty, and that, your own reputation would be saved and safe if you had him there to
control the board? Was that not your real reason, Mr. Wells? If it were, why did you
surrender? You said "the leaders and Mr. Herrin" agreed with you. Then why did not
Flint go on? If you will tell the people these things it. may help you. It will at least
be dealing frankly with them, and that is a commendable policy in a public man. :; â¢â¢ \u25a0% '
You have brushed aside the question of public franchises and other issues, as being
too petty for your consideration, and have said that the people "have -to take a Mayor
on- trust." - '\u25a0 : 'â¢\u25a0\u25a0;'... . â¢\u25a0:.;. :\u25a0';\u25a0
Now, if they were sure they were taking you on trust, Mr. Wells, it might be all
right. But they don't know that and nothing that you have .done or said makes them
sure that they would be taking you on^trust. In view of what you have said about your
own Supervisor ticket and of your vacillation in the Flint matter it seems that you are. not
your own man; you are "some other iman's man. They don't care to take that other
man on trust. "The leaders and Mr. Herrin" appear to the people as the ones who are
to, be taken on trust if you are elected.^;
Now, frankly, Mr. Wells,, the people would rather deal with Mr. Herrin first hand
and not second hand. He is the real scene and you seem to be the curtain. On you are
painted good personal reputation, a fair record in the Auditor's office, and other pleasing
features. But when the bell taps and you are rolled up, the stage presents an entirely
different aspect. "The leaders and Mr. Herrin" are there with schemes and plans un
known to the people and not seen on you, as y the drop curtain. The, people don't want
to take them on trust. They made you lead a Supervisor ticket that made your gorge rise.
They made. you stay,on the ticket .when ( you deplaredyoii would go off; | They,liked you
for a drop curtain.- They wanted to present -the people with a fairy r scene; may we say
with wells; of living, water? and you suited them. v ~ '
j Yes, wlien it comes to taking one on trust, the people want to know who it is; You
did the pig-in-a-poke act when you took ah unnamed Supervisor ticket on trust, and see
where you landed, Mr. Wells! How can you advise -the people to do as you did, and to
be deceived as you were? ;
You say now, Mr. Wells, that the charter compels a Board of Supervisors to be;
good and that under the charter it can't be bad. Who told you that, Mr. Wells? How
do you know it to be true? When did any form of government make dishonest officers
honest? ' What discipline, rules, regulations and written forms, constitutions or statutes
ever wrought moral change in men. by their mere phraseology and form? Mr. Wells,
don't play the siren and sing that song to lullthe public-stomach into peace with that
Supervisor ticket that turned yours*. / .. â¢
You have said also that if the candidates for Supervisors had been nominated first
you would have refused to go on the ticket with them. If your heading such a ticket Avas
so improper that you would have refused knowing what it was, how did the situation
change when it was sprung on you after your nomination? As a question of political
logic can you tell why your leadership of an improper- Supervisor ticket became proper
because you were nominated first, when it would have .been improper if you had been
nominated last?. In what respect did the chronological -order of your nomination -heal
the immorality and impropriety of the Supervisor nominations?
Mr. Wells; you have said a few things as a candidate. >You said you would go off
the ticket if Mr. Flint did not go on. He did not go on and you have not gone off. Why
was it so important that Flint should go on the ticket, why did he not go on, and when
he did not, why did you not go off, as you said you would? What light did you see that
kept you on the ticket? The people have not seen it. Will you tell them -.why you stayed,
why you are the political Casabianca ,of the campaign, and remain on the burning deck
without Flint to keep you company? The people are going to vote for and against you
for Mayor. They want a man of decision of character in that responsible, executive
place. You may make some votes by telling them why you changed your mind and
stayed after your positive demand was ignored. Who ignored it? Who induced you to
stay and what was the inducement? <
THE election is near at hand and the candidates are going to judgment upon the
record ,they have made since their nomination, and, if they seek such offices as per
'mit personal discretion like that of Mayor and Supervisors, the power behind
their nomination is involved in the same judgment.

man promised that the ground would I be
in fine condition at that time. He also
assured the committee that \u25a0 spectators

NANAIMO, B. C, Oct. 29.â John Peacey
of Comox shot and killed a man named
Torrance this afternoon. Peacey was ap
proaching Torrance's farm, when he saw
what he believed was a deer and fired.
His bullet took effect and it was only
when he advanced to pick up his quarry
that he found he had shot his neighbor
Torrance, who had been digging a ditch.

The. police have learned that- Sherman
always carried a revolver, as Elliott de
clared he did. . When Officer Pickering ar
rived at the house at 71 North Market
street no revolver belonging to Sherman
could be found and the Inmates denied
that he had one. A search is now being
made to learn if Sherman had sold or
pawned his weapon previous to his mur
der or if any of the inmates of the place
took the revolver and hid it.
Although Mrs. Sherman denied on the
stand that her husband forced her to lead
an immoral life, the police have discov
ered the charge to be true. Sherman ar
ranged for his wife to enter the place
where he was killed and Just before his
death had conducted negotiations himself
for her entering another house at 10 Orch
ard street. , .
Sherman's body will be shipped to his
mother In Indiana to-morrow.
STOCKTON, Oct. 29.â The records here
fail to show that the woman claiming to
be Mrs. Joseph "W. Sherman, whose al
leged husband was shot by Henry Elliott
In San Jose on Sunday. -was ever married
in this county. Her maiden name is Bray
and she has brothers and sisters here, all
of whom are respectable people. :
SAN JOSE, Oct. 29.â Harry Elliott, who
shot and killed J. W. Sherman on Sunday
night, was arraigned on a charge of mur
der before City Justice Cobb this after
noon. The complaint was sworn to by
Chlef of Police . Kidward. Elliott's pre
liminary examination was set for Novem

In the seventh Xeill punished the Roch
ester man severely, but the latter re
mained firm on his legs. Neill tried re
peatedly for a knockout, but failed.
So it went to the , end. Neill's hardest
blows did not put Donovan down, nor did
he show any desire to quit. The fight
went to Neill on points. The winner
lought a steady, careful battle from the
start, cutting out all fancy moves and
unnecessary frills.
The first preliminary ended abruptly in
the second round. It was between Kid
Brooks of Chicago and Billy Bevert of
East Oakland. Brooks was knocked
down twice in the second round. The
second time he rested on one knee wait
ing for the timekeeper to tick off the
seconds. The timekeeper said, "Nineâ
you're out," just as Brooks was ready to
resume the flg-ht. As he was officially
"out" the explanations he endeavored to
make 'proved unavailing.
Harry Foley stopped Jim Green In a
round and a half. Foley is tall and thin,
with some skill as a boxer. Green could
not fight and was battered all-over the
ring in the first round. He seemed dazed
and was only a punching bag for Foley.
In the second round some of Green s
wild swings landed and bothered his op
ponent. Foley finally knocked Green
down and his seconds threw up the
sponge to end the comedy.
A large crowd of sporting men went
over from this city. Among them was
Billy "SVoods, Corbett's old training part
ner at Carson.
It was announced that Kid Lavlgne ana
Tim Hegarty, the Australian champion,
would fight before the Acme Club on De
cember 10.
The latter proved game to the core and
seemed possessed of an iron face, which
ehed the. rain of blows as a duck shakes
water frojn its back.
There was an unusual amount of clinch
ing, and the men did a lot of hitting with
one hand free. Neill had a lead from the
start, which he never relinquished. He
went at Donovan when they came to
gether in the first round, missing- a vicious
right swing. He was more successful
with some left jabs to the head. ;
In the second round Neill continued jab
bing with the left, Donovan seeming un
able to g'et away from them. Donovan
was in distress at the end of the round,
two lefts to the body taking some of the
go out of him.
Neill tried a chop blow to the head in
the next round that worried Donovan.
Neill landed every blow known to the
ring, but each round found his sadly dis
figured opponent ready to fight when the
gong sent them together. Donovan was
bleeding profusely from cuts above each
eye. His seconds stopped the flow of blood
from the right eye, but Neill kept pepper
ing at the left, nearly blinding Donovan.
Al Nelll defeated Mike. Donovan In fif
teen rounds last night In the gymnasium
of the Acme Club, Oakland.' Donovan,
who is credited with having fought draws
with Mysterious Billy Smith, Rube Ferns
and other celebrities of the ring, proved
an awkward boxer, who is capable of tak
ing an awful beating without being put
out.

NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â Czolgosz was
hanged In effigy at Hempstead, L. I., to
night, with elaborate ceremonial, among
hisses, catcalls and groans. Moses A.
Baldwin Post No. 44, G. A. R., marched
with the elaborately. constructed effigy to
Smith's Hotel, where It was swung up
into a tree and many pistol shots were
fired at it. Rockets, Roman candles and
red fire were burned, and under the

end. Accordingly a carboy of acid was ob

surgeon. The autopsy occupied over three hours
and embraced a careful examination of all the

ple had gathered outside the prison gate to
watch the witnesses enter and wait until they
reappeared. The witnesses dispersed quickly,
some of them leaving for their homes as early
as 9 o'clock Â« . -
From the time Czolrosz had left his cell un
til the full penalty was paid less than four
minutes had elapsed. The physicians present
used the etethoscop* and other tests to de
termine it any life remained and at 7:17 the
"Warden, raisin* his hand, announced, "Gen
tlemen, the prisoner is dead."
The witnesses filed -from the chamber, many
\u25a0ol them visibly affected, and the body \u25a0was
tsJiPn from the chair and laid on the operat
ing tablet.

any call that might be made for his services.
He was rot wanted by the prisoner, however.
: The clolhlnir and personal effects of the pris

Mead shortly after the execution.
When the body of Czolrosz had been removed
from tfct room where he was killed to the
autopsy table. Auburn Prison returned to thi
routine of its ordinary life. The prisoners who
had beer, kept locked In their cells were re-.
leased at 7:45 o'clock and prison work was re
eumed at once. There was no excitement
Then iust as it had reached that point
he threw the lever back again for two
or three seconds. The body, which had
collapsed as the current was reduced,
stiffened up again against the straps.
"When it was turned off araln Dr. Mac-
Donald stepped to the chair and put his
hand over the heart. He said he felt no
pulsation, but suggested that the current
be turned on for a few seconds again.
Once more the body became rigid. At
7:15 the current was turned off for good..

It was Just exactly 7:11 o'clock when
the assassin crossed the threshold of the
death chamber.' Bufa minute had elapsed
and he had just finished the last state
ment when the strapping: was completed
and the guards stepped back. Warden
Mead raised his hand and at 7:13 Elec
trician Darts turned the switch that
threw 17M. volts of electricity Into the liv
ing body. The rush of the current threw
the body so hard against the straps that
they creaked perceptibly. The hands
clinched suddenly and the whole attitude
was one of extreme tension. For forty
live seconds the full current was kept
on and then slowly the electrician threw
the switch back, reducing the current volt
by volt until it was cut off entirely.
With these words Leon Czolrosz, the
assassin of President McKlnley, walked
to the death chair In the prison this morn-
Ing. A moment before the current ended
his miserable life he mumbled through the
half-adjusted face straps:

Cold
In the
Head and
Catarrh
Some people don't pay much atten-'
tion to a cold in the head, expecting it
10 cure itself, but it is just such little
things as a cold in the head that grow
to bigger things, to more terrible dis-
eases. For instance, catarrh is a
chronic cold in the head. It is a nui-
sance and an annoyance, both to the
fufi'erer and the sufferer's friends. It
means a foul breath and the nasty, dis-
agreeable habit of constantly choking,
expectorating, snuffling and hawking.
It is a condition that no person ought
to be in and any one who will use
Halpruner's Wonderful Medicine will
be relieved of it in short time.
Halpruner's cannot cure catarrh in-
stantly, because catarrh is chronic in-
flammation of long standing, and it
takes a little time and patience before
a cure can be effected.
Halpruner's will cure a cold in the
liead almost instantly. Inhale the va-
por o: the medicine and take a tea-
spoon Ful in a glass of milk or water
every hour. The internal dose cures
tlie cause and the inhalations give im-
mediate relief.
All druggists sell Halpruner's Won-
derful Medicine, but some may try to
talk you out of buying it. Pay no at-
tention to them, but demand the genu-
ine ' '

During September I took a very severe
cold. I was treated by two physicians;
also had steam baths, without relief. I
went by sea to Tacoma, and on my re-
turn I prew worse, having- the appearance
of consumption. A friend advised me to
take Dr. Halpruner's Wonderful Medicine
Internally every hour. It cured me In 'five

THEODORE ROOSEVELT
By WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE
A masterly presentation of the man's character written with frank,
absolute sincerity, and with an acumen and insight that no one else,
Thoroughly Equipped from Personal Acquaintanceship,
has ever brought to bear upon the. personality of Theodore Roosevelt. It
i makes clear just what kind of a President such a man is bound to make.
There. is no other writer devoting himself to this special branch of litera-
ture â the character study â who has the endowment, the literary art of ex-
: pression, that William Allen White has. It is a rare and great achieve-
\ ment to make
A Real Man as Typical and Interesting as a Great '
h Character in a Novel.
This is an article from which historians of the future will be able to get at'
the real man.

I assume that this question has no reference
to the case of a conspiracy to intimidate and
prevent a- citizen from laboring for or render-
Ing services to the Government of the United
States, and that it la only intended to em
brace the case of a conspiracy to intimidate or
prevent a citizen ; from his enjoyment of his
right to labor for private persons within the
limits of this district, or to carry on any other
private business in which he may be engaged.
Thus Interpreting the question my answer
is that the act of conspiracy to which it re
fers is not an offense under sections 5508 and
5519 of the Revised Statutes o/ the United
States.
Judge de Haven explained that State
statutes covered the matter. . \u25a0
Some weeks ago, when acts <tf lawless
ness were rife on the part of strikers and
sympathizers with them, the Federal
grand jurors took evidence and made cer
tain Investigations which convinced them
that an active conspiracy existed, having
for its object the intimidation of citizens
not members of labor unions from work
ing for their daily bread. The jurors
thereupon addressed an official Inquiry to
Judge de Haven, who made the following
reply yesterday:
Gentlemen of the Grand Jury: I have had
under consideration the following question sub
mitted by you: ."When evidence is submitted
to us which shows that two or more persons,
acting in conjunction, have conspired to hinder.
intimidate or prevent certain citizens from
following their usual avocations within the
limits of the State, and northern district of
California, would we be lustifled in indicting
the said person* under tlie Drovlsions of.sec
tions 5508 and 5519 of the Revised Statutes of
the United States."* -

test the suit. Mrs. Turnbull was placed

given her 40 cents, and that since he de
serted her she had been compelled to live

day on the ground of failure to provide.
She 1 was granted .permission to resume

"Mr. Fenollosa called attention to the
manner in which the Japanese,! with but
three of the simplest tones, were able
to present without confusion the most
difficult and complex scenes. He ad
vised modern artists to study the Japa
nese simplicity of design and coloring.
During his lectures the speaker frequent
ly related little l incidents in connection
with the prints which shed light on the
character, likes and dislikes, manner oÂ£
dress and personal adornment of the peo
ple of the. Mikado's empire. He told how
the 'women in various ages dressed their
hair, and how no females were allowed
on the stage of a Japanese theater.
He also told of the changes which have
taken place in the Japanese- physiognomy.
These changes v/ere aptly illustrated by
the prints. In the commencement o-f tho
art, Mr. Fenelocsa pointed out, the feat
ures of the Japanese face were strong,
almost classical, while in modern times
the face as rspresented by the artists
has become peaked, the eyes mere silts
and the mouth a mere dot. . "\u25a0" â¢ .
The pictures aptly show how one Japa
nese advanced the science from where
his predecessor left off, and how, with
the improvement of the art, the Japa
nese learned to blend their color so as to
lend softness to the scenes. .
Ernest F.* Fenollosa delivered another
of his interesting lectures" yesterdsry af-!
tcrnoon in the parlors of the First Unite
rian | Church on Japanese prints. , ; Tha
lecture was ] the first of his second' series
of ; three under i he auspices of the Chan
nlng Auxiliary Society. The speaker pre
sents his subjects," all on Oriental topics.
In a very vivid and entertaining manner,
and in consequence the addresses have
been exceptionally well attended.
The discourse yesterday was appropri
ately illustrated by reproductions of the
prints which have been executed by the
most famous of the Japanese artists. Tha
pictures in themselves presented a com
plete history of the art of making prints
in Japan, commencing with the most sim
ple forms in which but a very few tonps
were used and gradually leading to the
grand culmination of the art when aÂ»l
colors were used and when the artist die
not hesitate -at the representation in
prints of the most difficult pictorial prob
lems.' : \u25a0 -

A charge has been preferred before the
Police Commissioners by Captain Splllane
against Policeman C. D. Staples for being
oat his beat. Sergeant Shaw, who report
ed the case, alleges that about 3 o'clock
Saturday morning last an intoxicated man
fired four shots at Fourth and Clara
streets. The sergeant and Policemen
Heinz and Flynn heard the shots and
ran to the scene, but the shooter had dis
appeared. It was on Staples' beat, and
as *he did not appear the sergeant blew
his whistle and continued blowing it till
Â«ie reached Fourth and Bluxome streets
When Staples made his appearance he
said he had not heard any shots nor whis
tles.
Says Staples Was Off His Beat.
Leonard Nott, an ex-policeman and un
ion teamster, has disappeared. He was
arrested several weeks ago on a charge
of robbery for holding up Special Officer
C. H. Carrington and taking his revolver,
star and money from him on September 7.
The case was assigned to Judge Cabaniss'
court and Nott was released on $500 bonds.
The matter was taken before the Grand
Jury and an indictment was returned
against JCott, his bonds being, fixed by
Judge Dunne in $500. Since then Nott has
not been seen, and some days ago Judge
Cook, to whose court the case was as
signed, issued a bench warrant for hl:>
arrest. The case was again called yes
terday, but as there was no return on the
berch warrant the hearing was again con
tii ued.

kindly consented to be interviewed. She
is a wonderfully bright little woman, who
speaks excellent English. In fact, she is
very careful to speak slowly so that she
cannot possibly make a grammatical er

about Miss Wu Ching LJng, a little dam

as her daughter and brought to this coun

a wonderfully small foot, and a .wee bit
of a pedal extremity is not productive of

as her brother further suggested in ex

she does not like and never will learn to

DAlfDEUFF CAUSED BY A GERMI.
A New Discovery That Kills the Germ
aad Prevents Baldness. ."
Pretty nearly all the hair preparations
for tlandruff have some merit In allaying
Itching of the scalp, and in being a fairly
pood dressing for the hair, but there is
only one that recognizes what - causes
dandruff, falling hair, and baldness, and
that destroys the cause, a little germâ
and that is Newbro's Herpldde. , Thia
i germ eats its way into the scalp, down, to
J the hair root, where It saps that vitality,
-\ causing dandruff as It digs up the scalp
*2nto little white. scales. Unless it. is de-
stroyed there's no permanent stopping. of
falling: hair and cure of dandruff - and
baldness. Newbro's â¢ Herpicide - kills tho
germ. "Destroy the cause, you remove

NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â The professed anxiety
felt by the professional operators In stocks
yesterday seemed to be considerably relieved
to-day. Their professional brethren of bullish
tendency added the incentive of lively bidding
up here and there. As a consequence a con
siderable demand to cover short contracts made
the market strong during the early part of the
day. It was argued that with the easier tone
of exchange and the moderate views expressed
as to geld requirements by the authorities of
the Bank of France the probability of an
outgo of gold on Thursday of this week was
considerably lessened. The announcement Just
before the close of the market of an engage
ment of $600,000 in gold for shipment on Thursr
day precipitated a sharp realizing movement
and wiped out a good part of the earlier ad
vances. Another $2,000,000 engagement was an
nounced after the close. It was very notable
that tie stocks that were weakest yesterday
were foremost as a rule in the recovery to
day. The recovery did not reach to the full
extent of yesterday's losses at any time. The
upward reaction was achieved also on a con
siderably smaller volume of business. There
was an expectation among the small specula
tors thlB morning that ' formal . announcement
might be made during 'the day of an adjust
ment of the Northern Pacific difficulty. . This
expectation was again disappointed. Compe
tent' observers of the situation believed that
this may be a daily incident for some time to
come, as consultations, on this subject are con
stantly held, but with much remaining to be
agreed upon. Among the day's special move
ments the sensational rise in Michigan Central
revived the rumors of coming developments in
the Vanderbilt group - and was reflected in
sharp advances in other members of the group.
Michigan Centra! sold yesterday 1 at 116, an ad
vance of several points over the preceding sale
In last March. To-day It sold in 100-share lots
successively at 118," 120, 125, 135 and 140, after
which it- relapEed to 130. No explanation was
forthcoming of the movement. â¢ Amalgamated
Copper was Influenced by the supposition that
developments are pending which will benefit
the conditions of the trade. There' was some
support also for the United States Steel stocks,
accompanied by reports . of I great activity in
that industry- Brokers credited with acting
for ' Insiders both In United States Steel and
Amalgamated Copper bought their respective
stocks together to-day. These interests have
been supposed to hold divergent views of the
speculative outlook for some time." The buy
ing of Amalgamated Copper for Boston â¢ ac
count was very large, as it was of other stocks.
This is supposed to be rebuying of stocks sold
yesterday from . that source. In consonance
with the upward movement of prices the prev
alent view of the money outlook was less pes
simistic, although conditions In that market
remain the same. -A number of favorable con
ditions which were ignored - yesterday ; in the
selling movement came . in for consideration,
especially the continued ; trade activity as re
flected In the large bank clearings throughout
the country and the sustained Increase in rail
' road earnings. Reports to-day , of September
net earnings showed increases over September
of ltÂ«t year for some of the important systems
as follows: Atchison. $423,966; -. Reading sys
tem. JS0.853: Northern Pacific, $363,227;. Erie,
(32,227, and Chesapeake and Ohio, $31,775. Amal

CHICAGO, Oct. 29.â Corn developed the most
activity it has shown in a week, mainly on
a drive by the bull clique. Influenced by a
depressed wheat opening, December started
unchanged to a shade lower at Â£6% to f C.*i@
5C%c. Liverpool cables indicated a Comfort
able increase in prices and when there was a
considerable demand by shippers and com
mission houses and but a scanty supply
wherewith to i fill it the bulls started in to
push prices upward. The sagging wheat mar
ket retarded this advance at times, but De
cember sold to 57%c Just before the end of
the session, closing firm, >4@%c higher at
Cables were indifferent in the wheat market
at -the opening and December, started un
changed to a shade lower, at .71Va@71c. ' Early
advices had it that the drought still continued
In and prices rose a shade from
the opening figures. 'A quantity- of long
wheat was absorbed before direct cables an
nounced the rain in districts where it was
not. needed, and then there was a scurry to
unload. Under this pressure and influenced by
a very dull â¢ market priceB declined, being
steadied \u25a0 at . times only by the strength ... in
corn. DecÂ«Â«Â»t)er sagged to 70 1 / 4@70%c and

Weather and Crops.
Tr* weekly report of A. G. McAdie. section
\u25a0Jlrector of the climste and crop service of
"he Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY. ' \
Temperatures several degrees above normal
prevailed in the coast and bay sections and
in Southern California at the beginning of the
week, with warm, clear weather in the val
lej-sL L'.cht rain commenced on the 23d in some
sections, and continued at intervals throughout
the State to the close of the week. In South
ern California the rainfall was the heaviest
tor several years during the month of Octo
ber.
Considerable damage has been â¢ done by the
rain in some sections, principally to grain in
sacks, unbaled hay, late grapes' and beans;
the latter crop is reported seriously damaged
In Eanta Barbara and Ventura counties. Fruit
trees, pasturage and early ' sown grain have
been Bieatly benefited, and In some sections
the soil is now in good condition for . plowing
and 6eeding. | In portions cf the San" Joaquin
Valley the farmers are making preparations for
an immense acreage of wheat. .Corn and po
tato harvcstii* Is progressing rapidly. The
last crop of alfalfa has been harvested.
Ampie v&rnings of the rain storm had been
Â«1\'en to the fruit eecttons, and there has been
but little injury to raisins. The crop is nearly
all cured, and is moving rapidly to packing

Manager Jim Kennedy explained to him
that new Inventions have been adopted
which abolish the use of many electric
lights when the machine is working. At
a fight at Coney Island a -year ago so
many electric lights were used that it
made the atmosphere unbearable. Jef
fries was afraid this- would be a second
experience of that kind and decided to ob
ject to the taking of pictures. Kennedy
explained that under' the new condition's
the lights would not. inconvenience the
men. Delaney was convinced that this
was correct and withdrew his objections

"I am in fine fettle at the present time
and will do only enough work to keep me
In good condition. I don't want to take
on* a lot of weight. As a matter of fact
I want to fight Jeffries at the heaviest
weight that it is possible for me to scale
and still be in prime condition. I weigh
200 pounds now and will go into the ri'ig
only a few pounds lighter. You know Jeff
can t fight under 220, and I would like to
be as close to that weight as possible. I
will go into the ring in proper shape. All
pugilists say they will win their fights,
and I suppose I am llke^all the rest when
I say that the public will see a big rlnir
around my name after the battle " - â¢
Billy Delaney, representing Jeffries,
came down from Harbin Springs yester
day to formally protest against kineto
*cope pictures being taken of the Jeffries-
Ruhlin fight. .. â¢
Huhlin has been training about Blan
ken's lor the past five or six weeks and
has been sparring with a great many
pugilists who were training for battles.
He says that his determination to cut out
the boxing game from his training pro
gramme is the result of a conference be
tween all parties having a hand in his
training.
"If I don't know how to box now," said
Ruhlin, "I never will learn. Surely I
couldn't learn anything during the two
weeks that will elapse before the fight.
Then again. I don't want to take any
more chances of injuring my hands, for I
certainly would not enter the ring with
my hands in a .bunged-up condition. My
work from now on will consist of a run
down to the Sierra Point house every
morning. I will start out at 9 o'clock,
and, as it Is four miles down there, I will
not get back to training quarters until
about 10:45 o'clock. I have been over this
run many times since I have been in
training and must say I like it. At 3 in
the afternoon I tackle the gymnasium
work, punch the bag, do dumbbell exer
cise and skip i the rope. This takes an
hour of my time.

black cranium of Denver Ed Martin.
Ruhlin will indulge only in road and
gymnasium work trom now on to the
night of the battle. There will be a slight
variation from, this programme on Satur
day night, for Gus will journey to Red
wood City, which is about twenty-five
miles from his training quarters, to box
four friendly rounds with Joe McAuliffe,
who had an unhappy career in the ring as
an aspirant for championship honors.
McAuliffe, who is now working in a
tannery at Redwood City, intends to open
a boxing school there. Ruhlin goes to
Redwood Saturday to help out McAuliffe,
who was once managed by Billy Madden,
now Ruhlin's manager, on the opening
night.

The champion tipped the scales at 220

the night: of the contest weighing closts
to this figure.
The heavyweight champion is a great
hunter. Every chance he gets he takes
a shotgun and his favorite dogs and
climbs the hills in the neighborhood.
Yesterday he treed four coons, and, after
flaying three of them, captured the re
maining one and brought him into camp.
He placed the animal In a barrel and
tied it to the wire fence around the fish
pond, with the intention of subsequently
adopting it as a pet. One of the members
cf the training staff fooled him, however.
In the early hours of the morning "Bob"
Armstrong, who likes possum, quail and
coon, paid a visit to the barrel with a
view to gloating over his future meal.
The coon became frightened and made a
jump for the big colored boxer and the
latter ducked. The prisoner, upon regain
ing- his liberty, dashed into a clump of
bushes and disappeared.

and with his feet claa in strong shoes, the

f .-nook off the water and mud and they
continued the Journey.
Although perspiring freely and evident
ly tired trom his long run uphill, Jeffries
after a few minutes' rest doffed his coat
and tried his hand at the rowing machine.
He worked the oars vigorously for ten
minutes and during this violent exercise
kept up a running conversation. He
laughingly told of his fall and ridiculed
_agan's driving. He seemed to take de

this form of exercise highly benencial.
It not only strengthened his arms but

HARBIN SPRINGS. Oct.' 23.-These
are busy days in the Jeffries camp. The
<-hâ npirm o* the world is fitting himself
fnr battle as he has never trained before
and to-day presents a picture of rugged
, health and strength that is a pleasure to
t?_Â°* u*>on. He is Indefatigable in his
work and his eparrins partners and rub
bers have careworn expressions on their
laces. He is as restless as a thoroughbred
race-horse and as happy as an overgrown
boy. Jeffries cannot sZt still a minute.
If he is not sidestepping or feinting at his
companions he is dancing a Jig or raising
his hearty voice in song. Despite the fact
that he is going through a "course of

person, his sunny disposition never de

CORONA, Oct. 29.â Juana Campeo was
abducted by a Mexican named Rafael
Cabriz last Thursday evening and wa*
held a prisoner by him until Friday even
ing, when she was released and allowed
to return home. When she arrived at her
father's home she was in a serious, con
dition mentally and physically. -Â» .
The girl is 12 years of age and quite
pretty. Her father has charged her ab
ductor with a serious crime, and tho
warrant is now in the hands of thd
Sheriff. Up to the present time Cabri*
has eluded capture, but every effort will
be made to take him.
The scene of the abduction was a short
distance from the vineyard of John
Strong, â¢ which is about two miles nortn
of Rincon, on the Pomona road. Juana
had been picking grapes In the vineyard
all day, and as evening approached left
for her home, which was only three
quarters of a mile distant. She had gono
but a short distance when a Mexican
sprang out from the roadside and, under
penalty of death forced her to accom
pany him. As the man was on foot, the
girl could have been easily rescued had
any one witnessed the kidnaping. The
man took the girl up into the hills to- a
dugout and detained her there until Fri
day evening.
Aurain Campeo, the father of the girl,
was cutting wood in the mountains a
long way from the scene of the abduc
tion, and the first news of the affair was
brought to him by his son. Campeo left
immediately, and with the help of friendg
endeavored to find and rescue his daugh
ter and capture her abductor. He was
not successful, and . he then notified : his
employer here In Corona, W. B. Robards,
who informed the Sheriff. Through the
father's neglect in not reporting the casa
sooner the criminal may escape.

Misses H. Crap, Mamie Brannan an<l
Mabel Read were the young women who
left. Miss Read and Miss Brennan were
at the French Hospital at the time of the
trouble there with the nurses, and sev
ered their connection with the latter in
stitution at that time. Their places have
since been filled. Dr. James Bussing has
been elected resident physician, and Su
perintendent Murdock thinks that th?
troubles of the institution are at an end,
for the present at least.
On Monday night the climax came. Dr.
FrizeU's wife, says Murdock. wanted a
nurse's attention that night. Miss Dugan
refused the request. L>r. Frizell com
plained to the superintendent, who sus
tained Miss Dugan. The latter told the
nurses they would either have to obey her
or else leave the hospital. They chose the
latter alternative and went out with Dr.
Frizell and wife.
According to Murdock the St. Elmo
Hospital holds a commission from tho
State Lunacy Commission which holds the
superintendent alone responsible for the
conduct of the institution. He says he
Instructed Miss Dugan, the head nurse,
to notify the nurses under her charge to
pay more attention to the patients than
to Dr. FrizeU's wife. #
The St. Elmo Hospital, at Eighteenth
and Douglass streets, nestling under th
shadow of Twin Peaks, has added an
other chapter to its record of mlsfoi
tunes. The building- passed from the
hands of Its original owner, "Nobby"
Clarke. Then it was turned into a sani
tarium and smallpox broke out amontJ
the patients. Outbuildings to which the
patients had been removed were destroy
ed by order of the Board of Health. The
Institution was subsequently changed
into a private asylum for the insane.
Dr. J. I*. Frizell was installed as resi
dent physician, and with his wife took up
his aooae at the hospital. All went along
nicely until, it is alleged, Dr. FrizeU's
wife began to usurp the attendance of tho
nurses to the detriment of the patients.
Superintendent A. Murdock- objected to
this procedure and an open rupture was
the result. Dr. Frizell and wife and three
nurses left on Monday night, and a new
resident physician was promptly installed.

stolen. Practically everything that had

Three Fugitives Captured.
It seemed as if . he had dropped from
the sky, and most of the men were too
astonished to resist or run.
"I'll kill the first man that moves,"
said the Chief.
But despite this threat the three men
who had already prepared to leave con
tinued their act, but with a great deal
more activity. Two got through a broken
fence and one went through a small alley
way in another direction.
Chief Hodgkins with his revolver cov
ered the other six and announced his de
termination of killing the first man who
stirred. He had them so completely cov
ered that no one dared to take the
chances.
Meanwhile the man who had escaped
alone tried to run, but was pursued by
Willard Hodgkins. The young man was
fleet of foot and had plenty of courage
and finally overhauled his man. The fel
low started to draw a revolver, but young
Hodgkins made a jump and before the
man knew what had happened he had him
disarmed and handcuffed and was taking
him. back to the corral where the other
six were held by the Chief.
The two men made their escape toward
the railroad trestle which crosses the arm
of the estuary near the scene of the ar
rest. By the time that Kyte reached the
trestle the men were well out upon it
and headed toward East Oakland Kyte
took possession of the buggy of the Chief
of Police, . which was near there urTri
drove up to the Eighth-street bridle and
over to East Oakland. There he appear
ed at the end of the trestle toward which
the men were heading. As soon as the
men saw him they turned back toward
where they started, hoping to tret ha Air
before Kyte could again go the long dis
tance around by the Eighth-street bridee
Kyte was equal to the emergency and'
picking up a citizen whom curiosity had
brought to the scene, he stationed him
at the East Oakland end of the trP^tl^
with a revolver and Instructions to shoot
the men if they attempted to return The
men could not see whether the guard at
the end was the detective or not and aÂ«i
none of the policemen' were in uniform
the citizen did very well. . u mrorm
It was found that some men, strangers
to Oakland and not very savory of ap
pearance, had rented a couple of rooms m
a r building in the very center of the block
bounded by fieebnd, Third, Jackson and
Madison btreetc. The rooms- were In a
building in the rear of some old barns
and small cottages, and were so hidden
as to be invisible from any street, and
extremely difficult to Jlnd.
Chief Hodgkins made his way ' over
fences and through lots' until he reached
a small court or yard behind the building
that had been rented by the gang. In
this court were nine men, who were
wholly unsuspicious .that the police were
around. Three of the men were prepar
ing to leave, by different routes. There
was no time to call for reinforcements,
for. by the time the alarm could be sound
ed some if not all of the men would be
able to get away. There was only one
thing to do and that was to move in
stantly and take the chances of three men
with nerve capturing nine men, allt of
whom were desperate and armed.
Without a moment's hesitation Chief
Hodgkins motioned to his brother, who
formed a step with his hands and with
the old athletic trick tossed him upon
the roof of a low one-story building that
overhung the court where the men were
standing. It was the work of an instant
for the Chief to get upon the roof and
of another Instant for the Chief to jump
into the midst of the gang, revolver in
hand.
Chief Hodgkins' Brave Act.
The Gang Is Located.
The boldest burglaries were committed
last night, when several places were en
tered and a Urge quantity of goods
taken. The most important of these cases
was the robbery of the residence of Her
mann Bendel, one of the members of thy
h'rm of Tlllmann & Bendel. who lives on
the jcorner of Fourth and Alice street3.
The family was away and the house was
broken into and several 'hundred dollars'
worth of jewelry and valuable dres.-i
goods taken. Trunks were broken open
and everything of value taken, while the
rest of the contents was scattered about
the room.
Sohst Bros.' carriage manufactory, on
the corner of Franklin and Eighth streets,
was entered and J75 worth of valuable
tools taken.
Dickenson's saloon, Jn West Oakland,
was broken into and two revolvers and
$8 in coin taken. , _ ' \u25a0
The house of Emery C. Thurber, at 371
Sixth street, was entered while the fam
ily was â¢ away for the evening, and a
large quantity of goods was taken out
and piled upon the sidewalk. The thieves
were in the act of removing their plunder
when T. J. Desmond came along and the
men ran. Desmond pursued them, but
they escaped in the lumber piles of thfÂ»
water front.
All told, there have been eight, burgla
ries in three . days, and the Police De
partment began to feel worried.
Detective Kyte was. put to work upon
the case to-day, and a little later Chief oE
Police Hodgkins, whose detective work
has been most effective and attracted at
tention to the Oakland department, tooK
his brother Willard and began to do a
little work himself. These three men met
in the lower part of the city where thÂ«3
gang seemed to have their headquarters,
and after some hard work they discov
ered traces of the gang.

The most. daring, spectacular and brave
capture that has ever been made in Oak
land was this afternoon at 4 o'clock, when
Chief, of Police Hodgkins, assisted only
by Detective George Kyle and his own
brother, Wlllard Hodgkins, who Is not a
member of. the Police Department, cap
tured an entire gang of nine men who
have been burglarizing the homes of Oak
land for the last few nights. For twenty
minutes Chief of Police Hodgklns alone
held at bay six of the men. while Detec
tive Kyte chased and captured two, who
made a break to escape, and Willard
Hodgkins captured another who had got
away at the moment of the first attack.
Kyte got his two men, young. Hodgkins
got his man and these three were herd
ed Into the corral where the Chief, re
volver in hand, was .keeping the other
six cowed. The nine were then loaded
Into the patrol wagon and taken to the
City Prison, where tney are now on the
small book.
For the last few nights small burglaries
have been reported at police headquar

KITCHENER CLAIMS
SERIES OF VICTORIES
LONDON, Oct. 29.â A dispatch ' from
Lord Kitchener dated Pretoria, October
28, says he has received reports of the
fighting October 24 near Great Marico
river, when Delarey and Kemp attacked
a British force and were only repulsed
after severe fighting, leaving forty dead
on the field, including Commandant Om
stirbeysen. The British lost twenty-eight
men killed and had fifty-five wounded.
The Boers carried off eight British
wagons. The republicans appear to have
paid special attention to the guns, as
thirty-seven gunners and drivers were
killed or wounded.
Lord Kitchener mentions a number of
minor affairs and says this week's "bag"
consisted of seventy-four Boers killed,
sixteen wounded and 353 made, prisoners.
In addition forty-five Boers surrendered
and the British captured 471 rifles, 75,950
rounds, of ammunition, 216 wagons, 530
horses and 8000 head of cattle. â¢ ,

The. robber is 'supposed, to be the onÂ©
who has- operated in that locality for
some months. About two months ago
Sheridan Smith, a wealthy rancher o.
Bolinas. was held up at Fairfax and at
the muzzle of a revolver in the hands of
a masked robber was compelled to part"
with all his money and valuables. From
time to time Italian and Portuguese
workmen traveling through that locality
at night have been robbed. Every effort
to effect the capture of the thief has bo
far been unsuccessful.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 29.â The mysterious
robber of Fairfax has been at work
again. Last night the house of Manuel
King, a rancher living at the foot- off
Whites Hill, was broken into and' more
than $800 stolen. The robber also helped
himself to a rifle, two revolvers and a bi
cycle. So skillfully was the affair carried
put .that none, of the family were dis
turbed, v Entrance was effected through
the kitchen door, the lock of which was
bored out.

Arrival of the Gaelic.
The lumber schooner Rio Rey will not
go to sea for some time. A few days ago
she arrived with a full cargo and after
discharging it at Channel ' street started
away again yesterday. While beating
her way down .the bay with a strong ebb
tide she ran Jnto the British General. The
captain of the schooner made sure : he
would clear the Britisher, but the tide
was too strong for him and the collision
fAlowed. As usual the iron vessel suffer
ed but little, while the Rio Rey had her
sails torn to shreds, her topmasts carried
away and her fore and main \ masts
sprung. The tug Milton separated < the
vessels and took the Rio Rey ba'ck to the
Mission mudflats. '- \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0' \u25a0'

Nothing good at all has come from the In
dustrial exploitation of China. If its- na
tional life comes now It will come to meet
foreigners in self-defense against such atroci
ties as occurred a year ago. China was on thÂ»
way to reform when undue haste of exploiting
capital naturally alarmed the Chines*
mind and made it hostile toward western
movements. The Chinese 'are less ready than
ever to assume our higher civilization because
of what they have experienced in the past two
years. . , -
The Industrial movement is In some respect*
a more efficient method of approaching older
civilizations than is any other. When oMer
civilisations are brousht Into contact with
western ideas and Inventions and see their ad
vantages they are very ready to adopt .them,
so the Industrial cause la more effective than
are -missionaries in opening up the Interior
of Oriental nations. The main avenue of ap
proaching: them will, be through the demand for
modern conveniences. Capitalists, moreover,
try to extort as much as possible from tiip
natives when making their Investments and
thus hamper the cause. The Dutch are ex
ceedingly careful Jn watching out for this
problem, practically not allowing natives to
sell their lands to corporations, and so forc
ing , would-be -investors to seek unoccupied
lands. It can readily be seen that Industrial
expansion, if rishtly understood and carried
out, , may enrich the country by developing.un
occupied land.
. The trouble in China was due to the fact
that we had passed from commercial to indus
trial exDanalonâ to the fact that we did not
stop at China's shores, but went into the in
terior and asserted rights over her territory.
One method of the European powers was to get

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 29.â
Dr. Paul S. Reinsch of the University of
Wisconsin delivered bis second lecture on
"World Polities" in the university to-day,
speaking on "The Opening of China." Ha
said in part: -\u25a0
There has been lately a revolution in Euro
pean industrial life not less Important than
that at the beginning of the nineteenth cen
tury, when the whole policy of Knarland wan
directed toward obtaining free trade through
out tha world. The foreign investments or a
country like England are at present questions
of great importance, for the interest of the
people la directed toward places where th*
national capital can be safely Invested. T_Â«
first requirement of the placing of caDttal is
security. Let us look at the changes brought
about by this capitalistic revolution.
In early times there was no penetration of
the Interior of countries In our commercial ac
tivityâwe simply went to their shores, to their
harbors. But things have changed. Our pres
ent movement is in constructing inland rail
roads, exploiting mines, building sugar fac
tories and the like. On this account you must
know t-at your investments are golnc to be
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"All the correspondents noted the ex
traordinary difference in the aspect' and
manners of the people here and across
the border. We appeared to have sud
denly got out of a region of wholesome,
fresh complexioned people into a land of
a meager, pallid race like one sees t in
some of our manufacturing cities, an ac
tive, brisk people, lacking the courteous
manners of Canadians. To some of the
young French - Canadians of our party
this was their first experience in the
United States, and. they recrossed the
frontier more downright in their expres
sions of loyalty to Great Britain than
they had ever been before^'
LONDON, Oct. 29.â Most elaborate plans
have been made for the reception of the
Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York
at Portsmouth and London.
. It is not generally felt that the tour of
the . Duke and Duchess has been a suc
cess, as, on the whole, comparatively lit
tle interest has been taken in it, the war
and other events having completely'over
shadowed Jthe royal journey. The offi
cials, however' are determined that it
ehall end in a blaze of glory.
At Portsmouth an effective naval dis
play has been arranged. . Fifteen battle
ships aiyi cruisers will sail to-morrow -to
meet the royal yacht Ophlr and* escort
her to Portsmouth. Other, ships will join
in the reception, and Friday, evening, the
whole fleet in the harbor will be illumi
nated. King Edward and Queen Alexan
dra, with the children of the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York, and other
members of the royal family, on board
the Albert and Victoria, accompanied by
a flotilla of smaller royal yachts, will
meet the Ophlr in the channel Friday and
escort her into the harbor. .
The royal party^will take train Saturday
and reach London at 1 o'clock in the af
ternoon. Here 1000 troops will keep the
streets clear for the procession from Vic
toria station, by way of Constitution. Pic
cadilly and St. James streets, to Marl
borough House. All traffic on the-Lon
don and Brighton road will be suspended
between the time of the departure and ar
rival of the royal train. . ' '
.Newspaper correspondents who ..were
with the Duke and Duchess" party con
tribute some remarkable letters to their
papers here, highly appreciative of Can
ada, but they do not like the glimpse
they got of the United States. Thus iho
Morning Post correspondent writes:
"Some of us went to. Buffalo to see the
exposition, which was disappointing.
Buffalo is a slovenly if prosperous city,
in contrast with the handsome Canadian
cities we recently visited." .
, \u25a0William McAfee, residing at S26,Green
wich street, yesterday reported the disap
pearance of his brother, Harry McAfee,
to the Morgue officials. . The circum
stances attending the disappearance leil
to the belief that the man was either
drowned or shanghaied. ,
. The missing McAfee resides in the inte
rior of the State and was in the city on
a visit to his brother. % Thursday night hÂ«
went to spend the night with some
friends on the schooner Bonlta. Shortly
after midnight he bade the party good
night and was shown to a berth. Noth
ing more has been seen of him by hi_
relatives, but his hat was found on the
deck the morning following.
' McAfee's relatives waited until last
night for him to return, then notified the
Morgue officials. The deputies think thi
man may have fallen overboard anJ
drowned, or that he may have been taken
by force and placed on board some ship
going out to sea. * The police will be asked
to assist in the search for the missing
man.

IT was a great time for accidents on
thÂ«. bay Monday night and yester
day morning. The barkentine Port
land was In collision with the Brit-
ish ship Lady Wentworth, the
schooner Bio Rey ran into the British
General, the French bark Edmund Ros
tand nearly went aground on the Marln
shore and the steamer National City had
to put back from sea, the mate having
broken his leg. while crossing the bar.
_A. storm, blowing at the rate of sixty
two miles, an hour, was raging at Point
Reyes yesterday. The wind was from' the
northwest and In consequence a big fleet
cejne flying in before it. In It was the
British ship Lady "Wentworth, 134 days
from Hamburg; the American barkentine
Portland, 16 days from .Tacoma; the Ger
man ship Elfrieda. 133 days from. Ant
werp; the steamship Curacao from. Mexi
can ports; : ships Oriental and Indiana
from the canneries; the British ship
Clackmannanshire, 66 days, and the
French bark Edmund Rostand, 65 days
from Newcastle, Australia; the whaling
barks Aiice Knowles, .26 days, and Charles
W. -Morgan, 32 .days from the Okhotsk
Sea. and the steamship Gaelic from the
Orient. All of these vessels had to'an
chor below Alcatraz. so there was a big
bunch of shipping off Meiggs wharf.
CKA1PTER OF ACCIDENTS.
Four Vessels in Collision and, French
Bark Nearly Grounds.
Among the first â¢ of the fleet was the
British ship .Lady Wentwo'rth. Captain
Murchie was here eight or nine years ago
in the ehlp Peterborough I and in those
days runners were allowed to board the
ship as soon as the anchor was down.
Quite a number of the gang got "aboard
and made themselves at home in the fore
castle, where the quarantine officer found
them. Dr. Carmlchael,- was very angry
over the breach of the rules and at once
ordered the vessel and all aboard quar
antined. The runners cannot i get away,
as a -watch is kept on them, and neither
can Pilot Louie Meyer, who has to re
main by the ship.. , *
That Dart of the Lady Wentworthta
troubles came with the morning, how
ever. During. the nlgrht -while she lay at
anchor off Alcatraz the barkentlne Port
land, lumber laden and bound in from the
Sound, hove in Bight on the starboard
bow. The captain of the barkentine
thought It was a good . place to anchor,
bo he proceeded to do so. A very strong
flcod tide was running and "before the
Portland's anchors would hold she was
swept across the bow of the Britisher.
The shock was terrific and brought all
hands on deck in a hurry Tugboats were
soon on the scene and the vessels separ
ated. The Portland lost her fore rigging
on the starboard side and her fere yard
and the main rigging on the port side.
She was a.Iso badly strained and is at
present leaking- at \ the rate of three or
four Inches an hour. The Lady Went
worth was not damaged.

\u25a0 The examination will be continued to
day before Judge Heacock at ID o'clock.
Then the argument began. Heney, Mc-
Laughlin and Pillsbury dipping into the
mixture and tangle without much straJght
ening- effect. JCow and then the members
of the court would Interject questions and
advice. Heney and McLaughlin arguod
that the evidence was of so wild, chaotic
and broad a nature that they could not
meet it with certainty unless more closely
defined. Heney said that any evidence
tending- toward a conspiracy to resist the
writ of supersedeas was admissible, but
the evidence Introduced to. prove a crim
inal conspiracy which antedated or suc
ceeded the disobedience of the writ was
not material. The amicus curlae closed
the argument. He declared that the con
spiracy went to show the motive of the
contempt.
The court did not take long to decide.
The respondents' attorneys lost their ap
plication. The court will not review the
evidence or pass upon It until it is en
tirely taken before the Commissioner.
There was one reservation, however. As
the attorneys for the respondents claim
that the testimony adduced can not be
met until depositions In far-away coun
tries are taken and witnesses notified, the
court allowed them the privilege of ar
guing an application for a postponement
at some future time. \u25a0
Court Befuses to Define.
This was not the pith of the day's work,
however. It was ordered by the Judees
end agreed by the attorneys that the
question of what evidence should or
thould not be met by the respondents
should be settled once and for all at the
morning: cession. Francis J. Heney ap
peared when the court opened,' begged tha
indulgence of the court and asked for a
day longer to present the facts and evi
dence confirmatory of their position. The
three Judicial heads came together In con
ference and the time waa allowed. Mc-
Laughlln and Pillsbury had their say te
iore the order of the court was declared
The afternoon brought them all back
to the courtroom and Attorney Heney
made the first plea. He was armed with
an application that contained exactly one
dozen requests, all of which in the essence
refer to the striking out of testimony
taken before the Commissioner that sav
ors of hearsay, opinion, deduction infer
ence, argument or conclusion. Heney
based his motion on the ground that' no
conspiracy was charged or could be proved
tinder the affidavit upon which the order
to show cause for contempt was base*
that the respondent was not liable for
Judicial acts, end that evidence of other
and dissimilar and indictable crimes were
not admissible to prove motive in a pro
ceeding for -contempt. After reading of
this application Heney pullsd another
typewritten application out of his pocket
and went et his work anew, this time ask
ing the court to define the issues and flx
with some degree of certainty the testi
mony which the respondent would be re
quired to meet.
Argument on Evidence.
When the Circuit Court of Appeals con
vened in the morning the lawyers on both
sides, witnesses and the Interested public
were on hand. An argument was prom
ised. Judge AtcLa.uffhlln of Minnesota and
Francis J. Heney and Amicus Curi&e
Pillsbury being the contending parties.
But before this pouring out of â¢ troubles
flooded the courtroom Judge Gilbert In
formed the amicus curlae that the letter
which the respondents asked for should be
produced at their request. This letter is
the one that caused so much, discussion.
It was. according: - to the claims of re
spondents' attorneys, \u25a0 sent to .Amicus
Curlae Pillsbury some time last May or
June and signed by Kenneth Jackson,
Judge Johnson and Flncke. The letter is
supposed to oontaln a request on the part
of the senders for Pillsbury to use bis
eood offices In behalf of W. T. Hume. On
Monday the court ruled that Pillsbury
should hand the letter over and reserved
the right to pass upon Its admlssibllity.
Pillsbury did the passing:. The letter will
Co in as evidence during: the taking- -of
testimony to-day.
Even the best plans miscarry before the
Circuit Court of Appeals. Francis J.
Heney, associate counsel for respondent
Judge Arthur H. Noyes, - declared, he
would go before the court and have tlia
question \u25a0which he ' asked William F.
Brltt and which the latter declined to an
swer cerUtled. Brltt, a Call -reporter, re
fused to tell Heney who wrote a certain
article which appeared In Monday's issue
of The Call. A Â«imilÂ«r question had been
cusked. on Monday and the court decided
In favor of Brltt. For different reasons
Heney propounded the identical Question
and. tne examination then closed, with the
promise on Heney's part to take a certifi
cation Tuesday rooming:. The point was
& Knotty one. Heney slept on It Monday
night and decided not to force the ques
tion which still remains unanswered.
ILetter Must Be Produced. . -
The lawyers talked and the- Judges lis
tened yesterday in the Nome contempt
proceedings before the Circuit Court of
Appeals. The honors were not evenly di
vided, for when a count was taken at the
end of the day the amicus curl&e came off
the field with one signal victory, one
mooted point left In abeyance and a sln
srle defeat, the Importance of which is
doubtful.
