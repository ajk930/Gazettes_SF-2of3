are staying at the residence of Mr. . Wol

WASHINGTON, June 10.â It Is â¢ under
stood that Former President Kruger of
the Transvaal will not visit the' United
States during the coming summer W fall.
At one time there was a prospect that
Mr. Kruger might make such a visit, but
those having some knowledge of his in

at least for the present.

both parties to the war requested it, but
It will be remembered that Great Britain
joined The Hague conference only on
condition that, the Boer States were ex
cluded. There is no doubt that Mr.
Kruger, . who is a . serious statesman,*
came to Europe to obtain, the- good of
fices of several of the powers to end the
war, but* there is also ho. jdoubt that
Great Britain does not want their good
offices. At least it is true that' since the
South African war began Great Britain
has never, either verbally or In writing,
confidentially or officially, broached such
an idea. It is quite possible that the Boer
side has now formally asked The Hague
court' to! lend" its aid to end the war
somehow, and the court has held '^a ses

course, ' is entirely different* from any
serious steps to; end the war." '. ' .

LONDON, June 10.â Interest of those
Â¦who are watching developments in the
South African war centers in the forth
coming interview between Mrs. Botha,
Â¦wife of Commandant General Louis Botha
of the Boer forces, and Paul Kruger. It
is certain that she is the bearer of an im
portant message from her husband, and
the British press has lost no time In
reaching the conclusion that this message
Â¦will urge Kruger to-sue for peace.
The Sun hears that .Mrs. Botha will
etart on 'Â¦We'Snesday for The Hague,
where Mr. Kruger has been summoned to
attend a confernce of the Boer agents in
Europe and the United States to consider
the report Mrs. Botha has brought from
her husband, "in which he advises Mr.
KrugÂ«"-*as the constitutional head of the
Government to sue for peace on the

Lord Kitchtner. in a dispatch from Pre

CALL" "HEADQUARTERS, 1406 G
STREET,' N. W., WASHINGTON. June
10.â Gratifying toÂ» all California and to
Vallejo, and Mare Island particularly, is
the report that Admiral Melville will sub
mit to the naval authorities,' as a result
of his recent inspection of. the naval fa
cilities oh the Pacific Coast: His" recom
mendations are in direct line with the pe
titions that have _been> forwarded from
Vallejo to the Navy Department, and,
should they be carried "out. , all that the
Vallejo Chamber of Commerce and citi
zens and' the officials of : the navy yard
have- asked for will have been granted!.
Admiral Melville ''finds* that much is re
quired at Pacific Coast navy yards to im
prove their facilities , for handling j the
, large , quantities of repair work for ships
of the navy attached to the station.' As
the .vast, fleet serving in Asiatic waters
is usually dependent 'â¢ also upon- those
yards for overhauling, a'nd docking, naval
officials find additional need for new
shops, improved tools .and modern appli
ances. Â¦ â¢
Admiral Melville went'West with the
Presidential party to; learn the needs of
all stations on the Pacific. As a result
of his tour representations will be made
to the Navy Department setting . forth
the distinctive requirements of each yard
for its material improvement. If the re
commendations are Y approved . several
hundred thousand- dollars '"must be , pro
vided to carry out the system. S'Â»';i
, Requires Modern Shops/ , ' '
Admiral Melville found' the "yards well
adapted; for navy,, work the: whole/
but* all*" requiring, new; tools* . and many
'modern" shops : in order t<T meet thot de
mands made upon them, by the navy.
That at Mare Island, which is the lead
ing: repair station of the coast,* seems now
Illy "adapted" because 'of location, but* as
the money, invested in sites and plants is
too large to permit of a change to some
other ' point, there is no : possibility that
the yard will be abandoned.
The trouble found by Admiral Melville
is lack of water . through the ' channel
from San j Francisco to Mare Island for
ships of "heavy draft, -and the danger
arising now. in taking battleships beyond
San . Francisco for repairs and docking.
Only about twenty-two feet of water is
available at mean low water, and as the
Oregon and Ohio type draw from twenty
four to twenty-six feet there is ho possi
bility of getting ' them to the yards ex
cept under very light conditions, which
causes heavy expense and entails much'
time. . .
The admiral will urge that Congress
provide for deepening the channel to at
least twenty-eight feet and enlarge the
docking space around the wharves, where*
it is now; not practicable to turn, the
longer warships.. Large machine shops
are to be erected and sites were selected
by the admiral, who also found that to
equip the .shops thousands of dollars
must' be. expended in new machinery and
tools. , â¢; .;..Â¦'.'â¢* . - ;
The work . performed at the yard was
regarded by him as of high order and not
surpassed by any, of the Eastern r sta
tions. â ' . J , V ' ,

Bremerton, the new drydock far : in the

that -modern shops f.^be located there so
that when a ship is doc'; i any class of
repair work mivyj be carr, ' " on that bat

The, failure, of a firm, through unfor
tunate accidents! in building torpedo boats
for the navy, was noted and much sym
pathy is felt by . the .admiral that , a yard
of thirty; years'; standing should- have
been J forced to the j wall j through ! heavy
losses Government ships. This
yard Is located at Seattle arid its down
fall was due to serious misfortunes over
taking the torpedo ; boat Goldsborough

Â¦ Kennedy had been married but a month
when he was killed. Saturday it was ad
duced that Bert Prince had forecasted
the murder. A newspaper reporter -told
of Mrs. Kennedy and her brother Will
coming to his office after the murder.
Mrs. Kennedy wanted Kennedy roasted
in the paper, and Will said the marriage
was forced to prevent Kennedy from mar
rying another woman.
Prince had also admitted to witness that
the marriage had been forced upon- Ken
nedy. Then later, when Prince and his
father had called at Kennedy's office and
tried to collect $40 for Mrs. Kennedy's
beard. Will Prince related to the witness
that Kennedy had run out of the office
and had gone downstairs head first. He
practically admitted that he and his
father were armed at the time and that
Kennedy was "under the shadow_or a
: Lulu ; Prince Kennedy had recovered
sufficiently from her breakdown of Satur
day to sit in court this morning, and her
trial for the murder of Philip H. Kennedy
was resumed. The prisoner was pale and
sno was : suffering apparently Â¦ from ex
treme,weakness or the effect of sedatives
taken to produce sleep. Attorney Near
mg, for the defense, .expressed -the fear
that she would not be able to continue the
strain for any length of time. The first wit
nesses produced to-day by the State were
examined in an effort to prove that a con
spiracy to kill Kennedy was hatched and
carried out by the woman's father, two
brothers and herself. â¢ â¢
Jack Caldwell testified j.o a conversa
tion with Will. Prince on the day follow
ing his ' sister's marriage at the I court
house to Kennedy, at which ceremony
â¢\\ ill. Prince and his father were present.
\V ill had related the scene at the court
house, to- witness and told, of Kennedy
saying when friends congratulated him,
I will not be a r live man three weeks
from to-day." Prince had retorted. "Well,
you have prolonged your life by this mar
riage. . â¢ - - Â¦ .
Mrs. Kennedy Is Still Weak.
1 To-morrow the defense, will begin Its
.testimony to show that Mrs. Kennedy in
herited insanity; that Kennedy had ruined
her., and that his refusal to acknowledge
her as his wife temporarily deprived- her
of her reason. â¢
' Following. this the State will offer-evi
dence-to .show, that she was not a good
.weman before she. met Philip H. Ken
nedy. . ' . ; â¢
To-day the State adduced additional evi
dence to prove their claim that Kennedy
was" forced to marry Lulu Prince at the
point of a revolver; that Will Prince fur
nished, the weapon and nerved^Mrs.-Ken
nedy , up to committing the crime; that
the Princes conspired to kill Kennedy and
predicted the murder days before It oc
curred, and that the woman's claim. that
she was In a delicate condition and. shot
her husband in a fit of temporary insan
ity," produced by this condition, was un
true. ;..<''.

severe concussion, caused a third alarm
Â¦to be sounded. The fire was sweeping. In
the direction of Main streeticnd the rear
of many buildings that front on the last

Golden Gate plaster mills, at 215-217 Main
street, became ready food for the flames
and it was with great difficulty and dan
ger that the Cyclops Mills and the ngl
neerlng plant of P. i F. Clerc were not
totally destroyed. At this point the fire
was brought under control, but it was

The cause of the conflagration is sup
posed to have been spontaneous,combus

ble material were piled high in- the rear 1
of the asphaltum works, and the Fire De
partment was. called upon to extinguish â¢ a
blaze among them only three months ago.
The. explosions were at first, believed to
have occurred in Whitelaw's wrecking es
tablishment, -but the- proprietor took the
first occasion to deny, that he had any ex
plosives whatever, in ; his . place. - The

<Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦. Immense Crowds: View FJre. >.
Immense crowds of people had congre
gated on the scene. The alarm , was
sounded at a time when the Â¦ principal
thoroughfares of the Â¦ city were crowded
and the flames were visible from almost
every Ideation. The dash ; of the flre ap
paratus down Market street attracted the
attention of pedestrians and soon thou
sands of people were headed In the direc
tion-ot the water front. Every street car
was jammed. Men. hung on the stanch
ions and .climbed to: the- roofs, c This, im
mense mass of humanity was near when
the first 'bursting sound was heard : and
that lives -.were .not lost* in the stampede
that followed seems -miraculous.
The spread of, the flames, ' after'.': the
phaltutn ' works' was raised by -its force,
and when.it settled down into the ruins
with a great crash .dense volumes of
smoke enveloped everything .on the prem
.ises. The firemen did not flinch,' but stuck
to their posts and ;. continued to : direct
streams upon the flames. Debris dropped
around them, and several had narrow es
capes from being killed. v
Intense excitement prevailed, especially
when the first explosion was followed by
several smaller ones in quick succession.
No one knew what caused the explosions,
and rumors that quantities of high explo
sives were stored in the burning buildings
drove terror into the minds of spectators
who had assembled In I large throngs â¢ to
witness the fire. People rushed about pell
mell, shouting and screaming. The police
attempted to drive them In haste to places
of safety, and after, a time the flre lines
had. been re-established some -distance
from the position of danger. ' Many of the
terrified spectators did not stop until- they
were many blocks from the â¢ scene.. Â¦â¢ \p.
Then, came more explosions, but none so
severe ' as the first. Each renewed the
sense of fear, and the ignorance as* to the
'cause created a supposition that at any

would, not only result in a -heavy property

The firemen worked from Spear street
and turned their attention to saving the
lumber yards of Charles F. D6e, on the
corner of Spear and Howard streets. The
heat from the. flames ignited the 'lumber
and the sheds under which it was piled.
After many minutes of hard labor the
efforts of the firemen were rewarded and
the yards were safe from destruction, no^,
however, until the owner's loss had run
up to J3000. The numerous passages be

Immediately adjoining the structure in
which the flames originated is a lumber
yard, and in the rear several factories.
The entire block is composed of buildings
stocked with materials of a highly Inflam
mable character, and for a time a big con
flagration seemed imminent. 'â¢
Chief Sullivan immediately ordered a
second alarm, but before the extra engine
companies could respond the fire
spread to the T. P. H. Whitelaw Wrecking
Company's establishment at 216 Speat

Intense excitement was caused during
the progress of the conflagration by nu
merous explosions, caused 'by the Ignitiflg
Of niter, sulphur and other combustibles.
The explosions hurled '.Immense volumes
of debris and showers of sparks into the
air.. Fortunately there â¢ were no .casual
ties. The firemen stood to their posts and
worked with unabated energy while the
loud reports of the explosions were bound

scathed. . . ;
When the fire was first discovered it
was burning In the rear of the bulding oc
cupied by the Santa Barbara Asphaltum
Company and Tompkins & Favares, cab

Hartman was only about 21 years of
age. Friends of the couple said to-night
that he was Insanely jealous of the -girl
at times, and that they were not sur
prised at learning that he had shot her.
From the position of the woman's body
it is thought by the physicians that she
was killed while asleep by her husband.
NEW YORK. June 10.â It was learned
from Stage Manager Lawrence of the
New York Theater that a young woman
who was billed as "Rose Violette" had
been appearing in different productions
at that theater all last winter. She is
described as being about 22 years of age,
very handsome, with wavy brown hair
and a beautiful complexion. The young
woman was originally engaged by George
W. Lederer to appear in "The Man in
the Moon." She was with that produc
tion all during its run at the . New York
Theater and was in that part of the
chorus known as "red and black girls."
She subsequently booked with the
"Broadway to Tokio" Company, . stayed
with that, organization during its run in
this city and then went on the road when
it was taken West.
After this company completed its run
on the road Rose Violette returned to this
city with the intention of rehearsing for
another play. That company did not
open here, however, and the girl is said
to have gone West.
Rose-Violette's friends say that she left
for Chicago a week ago in company with
Louis Hartman. They also say that she
met Hartman three. weeks ago. Hartman
was the son of Max Hartman, a wealthy
cigar manufacturer. He was a graduate
of Columbia Law School and in March,
1897, when he was 17 years old. he was
married to Mae Belle Devis, an actress
whom he met on the previous evening-.
This marriage was annulled.
CHICAGO, June 10.â^ide by side, each
with a bullet wound in the temple, the
dead bodies of a couple who registered as
L. Hartman and wife, were found in their
beds at the Great Northern . Hotel this
evening. The room showed no evidence of
a struggle. Both lifeless forms' were com
posed and the covering of the bed was
well tucked about them. The revolver
clutched in the right hand of the husband
told the story of the double' tragedy.
The woman was identified as Rosa Le
Zebre, a variety actress known as Rose
Viobede. The father of the dead man is
said to be a wealthy tobacco dealer in
business in New York City.
Hartman and his wife registered at the
hotel June 6, giving as their address New
York. Both were stylishly dressed and
appeared to be persons of means. They
did not mingle with the other guests and
spent most of their time in their rooms.
They were reserved in manner, but from
the evidences of affection they displayed
it was surmised by attaches of the hotel
that they were on their wedding trip.
Early Sunday night they retired to their
apartments and nothing was seen of them
until this evening, when they were found
dead in bed.

Burglar Dorman Admits
Complicity in a
Killing.
Earl Kahney testified that he saw two
men at the foot of the bed. while the third
man was holding his mother.
The widow of the murdered man was
t-alled and told of having been awakened
by feeling a hand and cloth over her face,
bhe tried to rise and was roughly thrust
hack by a Ftrong man who was endeavor
ing to drug her into insensibility. She
finally tore herself loose and sprang to
her feet, one of the men still clinging to
her, with his back to the door, by which
her husband was entering to assist her.
A shot rang out and the murderer and
his companions fled. She opened tftfe win
dow and screamed for* help. Her hus
banc* gasped, "Wait until I get my re

and stumbled back again, to fall dying
at her feet.
PITTSBURG. June 10.â The trial of
John and Edward Blddle and Walter Dor
man, alias R. D. Wilcox, for the murder
of Grocer Thomas D. Kahney and Detec
tive Patrick Fitzgerald, was opened to
day. The Biddies entered a plea of not
guilty, but Dorman created a surprise by
pleading guilty. The terrible, double trag
edy for which the defendants are held re
sponsible occurred on April 12 last. For
weeks preceding the city was terrorized
by a series of burglaries and robberies.
Kahney was shot down in his home
v.-hile standing unarmed, in his night
t-Icthes. and Fitzgerald was killed a few
hours later while attempting to arrest
the defendants. The wives of Edward
liiddle and Dorman were arrested at the
*ame time and will be tried on charges
of receiving stolen goods. The defend
ants will be tried separately, and the case
of John Biddle was called first. It is be
lieved Dorman will turn State's evidence.
The death of the woman is shrouded in
mystery,- and physicians on the stand
differed widely as to its cause. The
State, however, declared that the woman
was murdered, although it could not be
positively proved. It was shown that all
the insurance carried by the woman was
assigned before her <_eath, and that her
will was drawn' up after these assign
ments had been made! The will had no
effect save in the clause touching crema
tion, and it is claimed by the State that
the will was prepared only to facilitate
the disposition of the hÂ«Â«1v after death.
CHICAGO, June 10.â Dr. August Unger
and F. Wayland Brown, on trial for
conspiracy to defraud insurance com
panies through the death of Miss Marie
Defenbach, were, this evening found
guilty and sentenced to the penitentiary
under the undetermined law. Frank H.
Smiley, indicted with Unger and Brown,
pleaded â¢ guilty and turned State's evi
aence. It is likely that he will escape
with -a light- sentence. : - ,
The evidence in the case showed that
Unger, Brown, Smiley and Miss Defen
bach entered into a conspiracy by which
Smiley was to appear as the affianced
husband of *the woman. She was then
to be taken ill and, apparently die, leav
ing him the insurance,' which included
one policy in a stock company and two.
in fraternal organizations, the total ag
gregating 525,000. The woman, in her will,
said that she desired her remains to be
cremated; and it is supposed that it was
the intention to hurry her away after
the supposed death and cremate another
body procured from a hospital.
The woman became sick, according to
programme, but did not rally, and died.
Her body was afonce cremated. An in
quest was held .by Assistant Coroner
John B. Wreckler, without a Jury, and
Wreckler returned to the Coroner's office
a verdict that the woman had died of
natural causes.

.The orthodox and liberal elements of the

B|ruggle as a result of the dismissal of
Professor Tubbs. It appears the trouble
has been growing for more than a year,

a crisis. Some of the younger ministers
claim that the ones who are making the
charges against Dr. Tubbs are going out
of their way to make trouble, and they
dub them "heresy hunters."

was received at King's College, London,

entering the church, he taught for sev
eral years in the Royal College of Mauri
tius before he was compelled to return
to England owing to ill health. It was
then that he took up literature as a pro
fession. He was GO years old when he
commenced his career as 1 , a novelist, and
his first work was burned by him when
the first- publisher to whom he showed it
refused it. In 1869 he became acquainted

"It is extremely doubtful whether the

The 'tariff indicates that American econo

Mr. Porter expressed the opinion that
Great Britain's backwardness in electrical
science was "due more to absurd restric

"Those that argue that Great Britain's
commercial supremacy is at an end be

the total of the foreign commerce of the

find the argument upset by the first bad

Rev, M. A. Rader of Grace M. E. Church.
Mr. Rader is quoted as having said yes

measures contemplating Mr. Brown's re

â¢was placed with a French bank. The In

You are now getting the suits at the same proportionate reduction.
The styles are Norfolk, Russian blouse, vestee, sailor and two piece suits. in swell 1901
patterns. The ages range trom 3 to 16 years. The. suits are divided into three lots, as follows:

' Repudiates Agreement.
, .. Saturday,' between 2 aqd 3 p. m., the com
mittee .assembled .Mr.' Jackson's v men Â¦ at hjs
shops as they had agreed to. Imagine the sur
prise of that .committee when Mr. "Jackson
repudiated his agreement of the day before and
eaid that .he* Understood, it to be nine hours'
work for nine hours' pay. : â¢ Now V for the ab
solute fact as to that agreement, Mr. Jack
son had prepared two different forms of type-:
written agreements to present to;the commit
tee when they, arrived at his place of business
on Friday. One read: Â¦-- .' , ' .-.Â«.. ,/â¢Â«.
i "On and after; May 2Q, 1901, â¢ nine hours shall
constitute a< day's work. â¢ Time and one-hair
for overtime uji Â¦ to 12 o'clock i midnight, and
double time, for all overtime after 12 o'clock,
and for Sundays and holidays. .The rate of
wages to be $3 per day.". ; .
. The other : agreement read: 'Â¦
â¢ "Nine hours shall' constitute a day with ten
hours' pay, with overtime," etc. . ' 'â¢ ". ,
,. This shows that , Mr. Â¦ Jackson : f.ully under
stood his agreement with the committee.; Â¦ /Â¦'"
What and who produced this sudden lack of
memory of Mr. Jackson? This Is not the first
instance ' wherein , influence has been brought
to bear upon firms who were Â«only too .^willing,
to settle with the International Association : of
Machinists and Bet their men to work in the
past week.\ As to the Â¦ levying of assessments
for tho support of the machinists >, on strike,
and. this ret--, about their getting hungry and
will give in. to the bosses,- It -may as well be
understood now as later. on that: the machin
ists 1 have ample funds to : prolong' <the strike
for rlx months or longer if necessary, and no
iriember of the International 'Association of Ma
chinists will go hungry, either. There are oth
ers Who are. on strike, and it Is necessary to
assist them to gain what they, are asking for,"
and we propose to give j them all the assist
ance -we can. Â¦:-' ..; â¢.*. *v... .. .. ', ., :<
'This was acceptable to Mr. Jackson, his
brother and manager, and was agreed, to then
and there, Mr. Jackson agreeing to post' a
notice to that effect in his shop on the follow
ing Monday and start his works up. He also
requested the committee to have â¢Â¦ . his - men
meet him* at his shops the next day, Satur
day, June S, '60 that he could have a talk
with them and find out If they were satisfied
with the agreement. Mr. , Jackson also stated
that he had not yet met with the other manu
facturers in this city; that he had just ar
rived from the East and knew nothing about
the strike except from newspaper report; -that
be had visited a large number of shops while
there and found them working on the nine
hour a 'day basis, with ten hours' pay, .and
found things were running smoothly; that the
employers and employes had as a rule come
to an agreement without any strikes taking
place, and that he could see no reason - fof
anything of the kind having occurred here. â¢
He was informed that whenever he was ready
to grant his men the nine-hour day with the
sarao wages the men had on the day they
walked out, together with time and one-half
for overtime up to 12 o'clock, midnight, and
double time for all overtime ' after 12 o'clock,
and for Sundays and holidays, and accepted
the International Association of ; Machinists'
definition of what Constituted a machinist, the
strike would be declared off so far as he was
concerned. Â« ' ' â¢ ' 'â¢ * " : Â¦ . - .-
Friday afternoon, June 7, Byron Jackson tele
phoned to the machinists' headquarters that
he would like to have the executive committee
call at his place of business, 411 Market street,
immediately, as he wished to come to an agree
ment with -the machinists and start up his
works as soon as possible. The machinists'
'committee, consisting of H. M. Burnett.. John
Ftzpatrick and F. Minedew, proceeded at once
to Mr. Jackson' 8, and found Frank Jackson,
Byron Jackson and their business manager
waiting for them. Mr. Jackson asked what was
necessary for him to do In order to start up his
works and get his old ' hands , back to work
again.
The following will probably illustrate how the
manufacturers are endeavoring to settle this
controversy, and will also show how unreason
able the machinists" have been in their demands
up to the present time: . : . â¢
It is stated by many business men and also
hinted at by the nress that the machinists and
allied trades will" not make any advancement
toward settlement: that the different trades
have put in conflicting agreements, wherein one
trade is asking for an eight-hour day. Another
is asking for a nine-hour day. This we wish
to emphatically deny, and ask all incredulous
persons to compare the agreements that have
been sent out and published in the newspapers
of the city. This is the best evidence and the
only evidence that should be â considered.
The nubile seems to.be entirely led, by. the
mere- assertion of the employer, and take what
ever comes from this source as the whole truth
Â¦without question. Is it possible .that 4000 ma
chinists, pattern-makers, boiler-makers, black
smiths and molders in this city are not to have
a hearing In the matter? Is not their combined
statement over their signatures as to what they
are asking for of as much importance as a. half
dozen manufacturers' assertions, coming' from a
source that Is bo questionable that they are
afraid to make It over their signatures so that
the public may know who and what they are?
About 100 steel-workers, the last of the
iron trades men remaining in the shops,
walked out yesterday, practically leaving
them deserted. The following statement
was issued last night by the press com
mittee of the International Association of
Machinists:
Headquarters Iron Trades Council,
SAN FRANCISCO, June 10, 1901.
Once more it has become necessary for the
machinists of San Francisâ¬o to present their
side of the controversy^ between the employers
and themselves, in order that the general pub
lic shall become acquainted with the true facts
appertaining to this struggle for a decent work
day, wherein the most skilled labor of this great
nation shall be accorded a part of the rights
and privileges of the common unskilled la
borer.
Steel-Workers Walk Out.
Unless the journeymen butchers recede
from 'the position they have assumed,
every butcher shop in the city . will be
closed to-morrow morning. , The conten
tion now is between the wholesalers and
retailers on one side and the journeymen
on the other. Some weeks ago the jour
neymen presented demands as to hours
and rates ot pay. In the main these
were acceded to, the journeymen agree
ing to supply union and non-union houses
alike. The matter was to be left entirely
to the discretion of the proprietor. â¢
Since this action was. taken,, some ten
days ago, a new question has arisen. The
journeymen butchers left it optional with
their employers to display the union card.
Some 50,000 small cards were printed and
distributed asking- members of unions not
to patronize any butcher shop in which
was not displayed the union card, al
though its display was not. made com-,
pulsory.
Action was taken by the wholesalers," a
general intimation being sent forth that
butcher shops displaying the union card
could not obtain meat. Many of the
cards have been removed, but a few shopj
still keep them in public view. Word has
been quietly sent around that if there is
a shop in the city which does not display
the union card to-morrow morning the
men will refuse to work. The stoppage
of labor may 'extend to all other shops
and a meat famine is threatened.
But the wholesale butchers say that
they will not supply meat to shops that
display these cards. The retail butcher
is consequently between two fires. If he
displays the union card, he can get no
meat; if he does not display^it, his men
will not work for him. .
The slaughterers did not strike yester
day in the Butchertown abattoirs, as pre
dicted by one of the delegates at the San
Francisco Labor Council on Friday night.
Everything was harmonious all day yes
terday, the men working the usual num
ber of hours. Upon the action to be
taken to-day will depend the amount of
cattle to be slaughtered to-morrow.

"DARCY OF THE GUARDS" HEARTILY
APPROVED BY COLUMBIA AUDIENCE
SAY COGSWELL
WAS A LUNATIC
Dead Capitalist's Heirs
â¢ File Contest to His
vWill.
Tell of His Belief That Spirits
of the Other World
H. D. Cogswell's faith In Spiritualism,
occultism and" seers and his belief that
after he passed this life he would return
"to inhabit one of his statues," which,
unfortunately, have been torn down and
consigned to the dumpa.have led to the
making of a charge that he was insane
for many years prior to hi3 death. This
charge Is made In a contest filed.yester
day to his will by Don Alvaro Skelllnger
and S. Stevens, children of Mary
Ann Cogswell, a deceased sister of the
late- capitalist and philanthropist.
Skellinffer, who Is 63. years of age, i3 a
resident of the Napa Veterans* Home.
Stevens resides in this city. In decedent's
will both were practically disinherited,
and they now. ask that the same be de
clared null and void and that. decedent's
estate be distributed as. though Cogswell
tad died intestate.
. For twenty years prior to his death, the
contestants allege, Cogswell was a
stanch believer in and devotee of Spir
itualism, occultism and Theosophy. and
invariably before any business enterprise
or any of his late philanthropic undertak
ings would consult and be guided by me
diums, slate-writers and so-called readers
of the past, present and future. .
Â¦ - Continuing, the contestants aver that
Cogswell labored , under the hallucination
that after he died he would "return to
earth and inhabit a monumental statue
of himself erected by himself In this city,
"whereby he would ever then be before
the public as dispensing free water 10
the thirsty."
Cogswell, It Is further alleged, also la
bored under the hallucination that he was
in Â¦ constant communication with disem
bodied spirits of the other world. By rea
son of such hallucinations the contestants
contend that the mind of the deceased
became Impaired, bewildered, deranged,
and was made unsound and Incapable of
freely ajad voluntarily executing a. will.
Â¦In fact, the contestants aver, dA:edent's
last will was not freely or voluntarily
made by the deceased., They claim that
thn same was executed under the undue
Influence of Caroline E. Cogswell, deced
ent's widow, "who called certain Spirit
ualists to her. aid to influence the deceas
ed to sign the will which she had dictat
ed," Mrs. Cogswell, it Is alleged, for
some time prior to Cogswell's death kept
her husband confined in the 1 Marechal
Neil Hotel. in this city and refused to per
mit any of her relatives to visit him.
Gogswell, it is said, oftthnes stole away
from the hotel' and would call upon the
contestants and say to them: "Try and
get along with Aunt Carrie, as I have to
contend -with her twenty-flve hours out
of every twenty-four."
The contest filed yesterday is the sec
ond which has been instituted since de
cedent's will was admitted to probate In
December of last year. The flrst was
compromised.

California.
The "Parisian Romance" at the Califor
nia is making as great a hit as any of the
pieces put on by the Neill company, which
has scored an unbroken series of triumphs
since it opened here for this engagement.
The play. is one of the best, and the fact
that there is a diversity of opinion as to
James NeiH's capabilities in the title role
has awakened an unusual interest in the
production. That Neill is satisfactory to
his audiences was demonstrated last
night by the applause he received. ThÂ©
part of Baron Chevrial Is a difficult one,
requiring all the gen4us of even as capa
ble and. versatile an actor aa Neill. The
desire to see him in- this role is great.
Fischer's Concert House.
., A. musical farcette entitled "A Smooth
Article," by Charles Kavanaugh. a well
known San' Franciscan, received its initial
presentation at Fischer's last night and
scored a great success. It was adequately
performed by Miss Gladys Graham, Miss
â¢ Maybelle Graham, Henry Graville and Ed
Graville, all of whom seemed to- have
hundreds of friends. in the house, judging
from the amount of applause bestowed on
their various songs. At the conclusion of
the farcette the stage -was literally cov
ered with floral pieces. Charity Martin,
the eminent operatic soprano, and Signor
G. S. Wanrell, the renowned basso-can
tante, sang several solos, and finally
brought down the house with the great
duet from "La Torza del Destine" The
one-act operetta, "Frietzchen and Lies
chen." given by Katherine Krieg and Min
nie Huff, Matildita's ballet and new selec
tions by Carroll, the whistler, and Samuel
Holdworth, tenor, concluded an unusually
strong programme ..-which should attract
large audiences the rest of the week.
Chutes.
Martinetti and Sutherland scored a big
hit at the Chutes in their comedy aero-'
batic, singing and dancing act. Josephine
Gassman made her reappearance, as did
also La â¢ Lista Hi her beautiful mirror
dances. " Other good numbers on the bill
are Murphy and- Hart, Irish .comedians;
Clinton Montgomery, In illustrated songs;
Baby Ruth Rolanft, and a series of new

"Bonnie Prince Charlie" began Its sec

Alcazar.
Grand Opera-House. ,
The stage presence of Mel
bourne MacDowell, his breezy virility, the
grace and beauty of Florence Stone as she
portrays the fleeting lights and shadows
of the .varying moods of the Empress
Theodora, the gorgeous costumes, splen
didly barbaric, and the artistic work of
Frederick Hartley as the cruel coward
Justinian, all unite in making Sardou's
"Theodora", a success on its. first pre
sentation in the English language in this
city. Miss Stone assumes the role nat
urallyâat one moment the careless, frivo
lous girl, at another the tender, loving
maiden and again the Empress, proud and
strong in the consciousness of her power.
Curtain calls last night were numerous
and were well -merited.- The company is
well cast, the parts well balanced and the
play a winner.

of wages to be submitted to employers
on July 1 has been adopted, but some of

To see "Darcy of the Guards" played
as it was played last night is to see it
under probably the best possible auspices,
and it may be assumed that the comedy
can fairly be judged by its initial pre
sentment. ~A success it is undoubtedly,
though not to set the Thames on fire from
the standpoint of novelty, and to Henry
Miller, who-as Darcy " has added yet an
other to" his finished portraits of men and
manners, an important percentage of its
triumph is due. A graceful figure as the
Irish major he is, with the right and
happy-go-lucky accent and careless chiv
alry. He has a good scene with Pamela
when he first tells the scornful maid that
he loves her and is turned down with a
truly awful vigor. He makes much of the
opportunity, with a fine and delicate art,
persuading all to pity, and promptly
heaps coals of fire upon her head after
ward by rescuing the lady's brother from
the danger of arrest as a rebel spy. 1 His
delight on learning that it is the brother
he has saved, not her lover, as he had
imagined, is a delicious bit of work. '
Miss Rockwell takes good care of the
part of Pamela and is altogether a charm
ing rebel miss. .. .-.-;:.. _
"Darcy of the Guards" adds yet an
other, to the long list or plays of the revo
lution, its scene laid in Philadelphia dur
ing the occupancy of the British under
Cornwallis.' AH the picturesque in
cidents of -the rebellion are made
much of, . the \ British soidiers * bil
leted Â¦ in the rebellious household,
the usual love affair between, the
rebel daughter and her enemy-at-law, the

Thicks the r-ife, to have the wedding ring

Something is happening. That ring
could hardly be pulled from the finger
when it was put there a few years ago.
Now it slips off by its own weight How
thin the fingers have grown ! And the
fingers don't grow thin alone. How thin
the face is and how thin the once plump
form. Almost unconsciously the wife
has been fading and wasting away. The
strengtn given to children has never been
regained. Drains which should have been
stopped hive been neglected.
That is a common experience with
women, unless some friend has shared
with them the secret of the strengthening
end healing power of Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription. It regulates the periods,
dries the drains which undermine the'
strength, heals inflammation and ulcera-

the babj's advent practically painless and
gives vnjor and vitality to nursing mothers.

Is known, however, that Jackson contra

something about the crime it was decided
to lock him up pending an investigation.

up Sunday night on suspicion of knowing
something about the murder of little Rob
bie Hislop, was released from custody
yesterday afternoon by order of Captain
Seymour. .
"Jackson haa convinced me that he is
innocent of any connection with the
crime," said Captain Seymour. "I am
satisfied that he is telling the truth, and
for that reason I concluded 'not to hold
him." - ... . "

allowed to each department of the city
government for the fiscal year 1901-2 and
making a budget of the same was finally,
passed. - : - â¢Â¦ -.â¢.-:: * Â¦Â¦ -
The Board of Works was directed to re
port-what streets and sewers are in need
of reconstruction or repairs. . ; .
An ordinance was passed to print which
exempts certain appropriations - from the
one-twelfth clause in the charter.
The demands of the State Commission
in: Lunacy for the care of criminal insane
committed from this city to the State
hospitals were rejected.
The resolution awarding the contract to
light- the public streets to the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company at 9
cents per gas lamp and 35 cents for each
electric lamp was referred to the Lighting
Committee, to see if the rates are ' the
same as those adopted by the board. The
Independent Electric Light . and Power
Company received the contract to light
certain public buildings at 29 cents per
1000 watt hours, and the Equitable 1 Gas
Company to light with gas certain engine
houses at 98 cents per 1000 cubic, feet. The
award to! the' Independent Electric Light

I The National Sporting Club was grant
ed a' permit for a .boxing- exhibition in
August. -Reed's resolution Â¦ that .the San
Francisco Athletic Club be given a per
mit for September was adopted after a
long discussion over the justice of the ro
tation rule employed in giving the privi
lege to the existing clubs.
A resolution prohibiting all athletic
clubs from holding any boxing exhibition
on 'the Fo"urth of July, "under penalty of
forfeiting their license, was defeated.
The resolution was directly aimed at the
San Francisco Athletic \ Club, which has
an j exhibition scheduled on the date
named. The recommendation of Super
visors Stafford and Tobln ! of the Police
Committee evidently. did not meet with
the approval of the rest of the board.
Reed, the third member of the committee,
did not join in the recommendation, and
Brandenstein Â¦ thought that if fights were
prohibited on one day. they should be dis
continued on all others. The disinclina
tion of the. board to ratify the majority
report of the Â¦ committee was fortified
through . the members realizing that per
mits were had for the asking by Eastern
ers who invade this coast and depart with
large sums of money. | Reed said it â¢ was
an injustice to harass a local club that
had made all arrangements for the exhi
bition at a large 'expense: His colleagues
thought the same way â¢ and voted down
the resolution, which was regarded as
contemplating an unjust discrimination.
The demands,, eleven in number, aggre
gating $290, for services rendered as Grand
Jurors were rejected, there being no pro
vision in the law for the payment of the
claims.., ... ,' V"...

ance by the city of the option of the Peo

needs of Petaluma and Napa creeks and I
asked that a visit to them by the visit- i
ing committee be arranged. ;
ticceral Chipman epoke of the advant
ages which would accrue to this section
.of the country, if proper steps were taken
to insure safe navigation of the upper ,
Sacramento River and suggested that the I
matter should be brought prominently be- I
fore the visitors.
J. J. Luchsingrer called attention to the
need of dredging at Pinole Point, and also
to Commission Rock, which is a menace
to shipping- in the Mare Island straits.
Captain Hatch of the steamer General
Frisbie offered the use of his vessel to
take the party to Vailejo in case such a
trip could be arranged.
President G. D. Clark of the Union
League Club said that the club would be
pleated to tender a reception to the visi
tors if the time could be spared. The plan
met with general favor and was referred,
together with the other suggestion's, to
the sub-committee appointed by Chair
man Newhall, which is made up as fol
lows:
W. II. Bunker. F. TV". Dohrmann. A. Sbar
boro, T. J. Parsons.' N. -P. Chipman, G E.

ness and surety with which Peruna
acts in these cases .has saved many
Hv3S. A large dose . of Peruna should
be taken at the first appearance of a cold
in summer, followed by small and oft-
repeated doses. There Is no other remedy
that medical science can furnish so re-
liable and quick in its action as. Peruna.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the use of Peruna,
write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable advics
gratis. -
Address Dr. Hartman, President of The
"Hartman Sanitarium, Columbus, Ohio.
Miss Sophie IS. Smith, president of the'
Jacksonville Art : Club, writes from 17 ,
west Adams street, Jacksonville, Fla., as ,
follows: . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â« - <
.. "From bad to worse is the story of ,
a hard cold when it settles on the]
lungs and spreads catarrh through
the system. From sick to well is the,
story when you use 'Peruna, I have]
tried it twice, and each time I had a*
hard cold, and although one was in,
midsummer and the other Jn mid-
winter Peruna cured me each time. \
I give it my highest endorsement â it]
is well deserved."â Sophie B. Smith.
A UNITED STATES SENATOR'S WIFE!
PRAIES PERUNA. " <
Mrs. F. E. "Warren, wife of the late'
Governor and . now .United States Sen-
ator F. E. Warren of "Wyoming,- writes
the following voluntary testimonial to the
value cf Perunaf She says:
"/ am % never without Peruna either
in my home or in my travats. It is]
truly a great triumph of scientific]
medicine. I am constantly troubled <
with coughs, colds, etc., but thanks to\
your good medicine Peruna, I always]
find a prompt cure: I believe, no med-
icine, ever brought before the public
has effected so many permanent cures'
as Peruna."â Mrs. F.E. Warren,
1848 Wyoming St., Washington, D. C.
Catching cold. in the summer is~a more
frequent occurrence than Is most gener-
ally supposed. Winter is generally sup-
posed to be the. time for. colds. But cool
nights alternating with hot days, sudden
showers following sultry heat, profuse
perspiration and cooling draughts, are all
peculiar to summer, which causes a mul-
titude of people to catch cold.
Summer colds require prompt treaty
ment. .They are always- grave, and
sometimes dangerous. The oromo*-
President Jackscnville Art Clu-.
"I Give Peruna My Highest En-
dorsement it Is '. Well De-
served." - .'Â¦

WHEN, after the dreary years of industrial de
pression following the enactment of a Demo
cratic tariff, prosperity came back to the
country with the passage of the Dingley bill, it
seemed incredible that there should be another agi
tation" for tariff changes on a large scale in the United
States for the rest of this generation. That which was
deemed so improbable is, however, that which now
seems likely to occur. A new fight is to be made
against the protective system, and, strange as it may
appear, the leaders in the fight are men who have prof
ited by protection and who still need it for the con
tinued prosperity of their business.
The fight has taken the form of an agitation for
what is called reciprocity. Under that name it is pro
posed to barter away the protection of some indus
tries for the sake of gaining . advantages, for others.
The broad principle that protection is to be applied
equally to all American industries is to be set aside in
favor of a hew principle of commercial barter, and
instead of a well devised comprehensive tariff we are
to have such customs duties as will result from va
rious reciprocity treaties made at different times .with
different countries . by different negotiators and for
different purposes. . ' .
Among the advocates of a scheme of tariff
tinkering are some of the -foremost manufacturers of
the country. At the iecent meeting of the National
Association of Manufacturers the president (Thomas
C. Search) is reported to have made a plea for re
ciprocity that would open, foreign' markets for our
manufactured goods. He claimed that Germany, Rus
sia, Austria and. France are all "expressing with much
emphasis their dissatisfaction with our national pol
icy, which seeks to obtain all possible trade advantages
and yet is unwilling to concede any favors in return."
Those countries, he went on to argue, are willing to
consider mutual trade concessions, but are at present
antagonistic to American trade because it is unfair.
. Proceeding to explain the policy he thinks should
be adopted Mr. Searches quoted as saying: "I believe
I do not overestimate its importance when I say that
the continuance and further extension of our magnifi
cent export trade in manufactured products depends
more upon our willingness to barter privileges with
our foreign customers than upon any other influence
that we can discern at the present time. 1 We can yield
much that will be of value to: others without causing
loss or injury to bur own interests. If we are*not will
ing and able to adopt such a policy we must 'expect
not only the loss of privileges we now enjoy, but"also
open, retaliations apunishment for our selfishness.
As the first practical step let us urge 'the Senate, to
ratify the treaty, of commercial reciprocity with
France, so long delayed, so repeatedly postponed, but
still alive." â¢ â¢ .

who believe the United States Government should sac

AMERICAN AUTHORS.
G.EORGE H. WARNER, associate editor of
the Library of .the .World's. Best Literature,
has recently contributed to the New York
Times' an elaborate study of American authorship
from colonial* times -to 1895, designed for. the purpose
of determining the nationality of the writers of Ameri
can books, the native State of. each writer, and the
vocations of the authors.
The number of names examined is 6500, and Mr.
Warner says of the list: "It is probably too. small a
number by some' 500, or 600, Â¦ but the' averages are
probably as .correct as* are necessary. for our study,
notwithstanding the omissions." Writers of occasional
poems, magazine articles, etc.," are not included in the
list, as'none are accounted as authors except those who
have produced "definite books.". Of the total number,
700 are known to have been born in foreign lands, and
there are upward of 200 whose birthplaces have not
been ascertained. '
Of the native writers, upward of 2300 were born in
New England. The Middle States furnish/2O0O. v ' Con
necticut has the credit of producing the largest num
ber of ' writers in' proportion , to population of any
Â¦ State' in -the Union. Considering numbers without
j regard to population, Massachusetts leads with 1243',
! New York has 1060, Pennsylvania 613. , Of the South
| ern and the Western States Mr. Warner says .Vir
ginia has 225 authors, South Carolina 118, while North
Carolina has 71, Georgia has 56, Alabama 28, Missis
sippi 19, Louisiana 21, and-Texas has but 3. In the
interior South, Tennessee has 34, JKentucky^o, .both'
being'in some respects extensions' of Virginia, while
Missouri has 26 and Arkansas 3. Of the Western
States, Ohio takes the lead, with 174 abhors, while In
diana has 55, Illinois 47, Michigan 36 and California 6.
All the others combined have 37. â¢ ' \
"Of course, such' a list is very far from being accu
rate.. The number of authors assigned to California,
for example, is far below the' fact.; "Nevertheless, the
list is an interesting rec6rd of, the literary activity of
. the-people of different sections of the country in the
1 past. A" list confined to living authors would make a
j much' better showing for the South and the West. In
1 fact, of. well-known writers who "produce not only
what Mr. Warner "calls "definite .books," but books
that are widely read, those sections ~f the Union have

Lord Kitchener appears to have overlooked one of
the vital and important elements of British reports in
his account of the latest Boer victory in. South Africa.
He neglected utterly even to suggest that familiar
clause, "I- regret to state." Perhaps regrets- are : be

tâ * OR nearly two years The Call has sounded the
j~H alarm over the lawless and destructive conditions
â¢*Â¦ to be found upon the arid stock ranges on the
public domain west of the ninety-ninth meridian. We
Degan with the fate that had overtaken Wyoming,
ivhere a great value m cattle had disappeared as a re
iult of destroying the forage and the introduction of
.-beep. We showed that the lost cattle value had been
replaced by a far less sheep value, to the loss of the
State's wealth, and that 13,000,000 sheep would be re
quired to replace the lost cattle value, and that num
ier of sheep would in one year reduce Wyoming to a
just heap.
We predicted two years ago the coming war on the
?ree range. That strife is now on. The contending
T orces have met in Colorado and Wyoming, men have
seen shot and the stock has been slaughtered.
Mr. Allen, a stock man of Ogden, is up in Wash
ington for the purpose of leasing "grazing lands on the
N'onhern Pacific grant upon which to feed his stock.
Fie is interested in sheep, and sees the end approach
ing. In an interview at Tacoma he says that there is
an excess of 1,000.000 sheep over the capacity of the
range to carry them. This means the whole range,
ind that if cattle are expelled entirely and all is given
jp to sheep they already overstock it to that vast
lumber.
The result is a violent and bloody struggle for ex
istence. There is but one remedy, and that is the
immediate limitation of the flocks and herds to the
supporting capacity of the range and the conSnement
of every stock man's sheep and cattle to his own lease
lold, secured from the Government on*Stlch conditions
as protect large and small owners alike, make the
actual settler secure in control of range for his domes
cic animals, and safeguard likewise the rights of the
roming homesteader and the mineral prospector.
Mr. Allen indicates the exclusion of sheep from the
forest reserves as one cause of the appalling condition
of that industry. But if the reserves are reopened to
sheep they may as well be abandoned entirely. The
cattlemen oppose such privilege on the forest/ re
serves because they protect the water sources and con
serve the moisture of the arid region and supply the
means of irrigation, upon which agriculture must de
pend.
The effect of the situation which this sheep-owner
admits to exist reaches far into the interests of the
whole Union. It is causing the rapid rise in the price
of beef, which not only touches the domestic con
sumer but impairs the packing industry by threatening
.0 raise the export price beyond the possibility of com.
petition with Australia and the Argentines.
All these are grave consequences of a situation that
ought not to exist, and can be completely transformed
by the adoption of the leasing policy.
THE RANGE WAR.
the amelioration of the causes deleteri
ously affecting an increase in the popula-'
tion as distinguished from the mere com
mercial prosperity ' and advancement of
the colony as a center for the settlement
of our white brethren.' For a period of
twenty-five years Fijians have been gov
erned through a" native commissioner,
with the aid of the native chiefs, who
have occupied officially and by virtue of
their heredit ory rank the position of lieu
ter.ant gover Â»rs to the various provinces,
where they have full power. This.patri
archal form of government has been sat
isfactory in so far as a large population,
formerly of a wild 'class, have been con
verted into the most law-abiding sub
jects of the British monarch, and, further,
this system of government has enabled
the administration to collect a large rev
enueâabout Â£20,000 a year.
A Nearly Ideal Government.
It has fostered a system of- comparative
Industry and mutual help, such as to draw
forth from a 'recent distinguished Ameri
can lately visiting the group the opinion
"that as a result of an investigation un
dertaken by him of the conditions of gov
ernment, prosperity and well-being of the
natives under various administrations in
this hemisphere, that of Fiji most nearly
approaches the ideal philanthropic care in
these times expected from sovereign Eu
ropean powers to colored races."
The system in vogue in Fiji must have
much to commend itself when the trium
virate of powers in Samoa as a result of
their investigations into the late troubles
in those islands recommended the powers
to follow the methods existing in Fiji,- for
the pacification and government of that
group by "a council of district chiefs pre
sided over by the administrator Â¦ of the
colony" and the doing away of the king
ship. Indeed, such philanthropic govern
ment of natives should be pursued In Fiji
if anywhere; the annexation of those
islands to the crown of England was actu
ated a desire for the preservation of
the natives, and the "deed of cession" pro
vided for the fosferlng care to be bestowed
upon the natives and the guarding of their
native rights and customs.
The Native 'Administration.
The native Fijian population amounts to
about 98,000^ scattered over as many; as
eighty islands. The group is divided into
fourteen provinces, each province roughly
containing about 6000 people, presided over
by. a roko, or. hereditary chief, having un
der him heads of districts and towns, and
a large native staff. of officers, scribes and
native magistrates. European magistrates
are resident in parts of the group, and ex
ercise judicial functions for the more seri
ous offenses committed among "natives;
minor offenses are dealt with by natives
themselves , in the native courts. Euro
pean 'magistrates have ; till - now been dis
couraged from in any way interfering in
the administration, of the provinces. In
the past the native administration has
been corrupt, inefficient, unreliable and in
a great many instances oppressive by rea
son of the exactions of chiefs, Instability
of the native character and want 'of di
rect supervision by European offlcers;'the
central native jr4jninistratlon from the na
tive office has been in the past hidebound,
and a victim to a perpetuation of the na
tive, "status in quo,"^resulting in condi
tions most unsatisfactory individually to
the native and" to the' continued, develop
ment-of the race. -. . " - Â¦- â¢ Â¦ " \
All that is now changed. Under the new
system traveling inspectors are appointed
in the various provinces, vested with judi
cial and administrative powers, whose
duty it is to attain an IntimafteVknowleilge
of the different districts and villages, the
people, their, language, customs, habUs,

sion of New Caledonia. â¢ the advantages
which it offers as .a coaling station for
our fleet In these waters . and Â¦ the future
cable route to Canada are all matters of
high imperial -policy which must follow
as, a result of colonial federation. What
the colony of Fiji has always lacked is a
large European population, or the intro
duction of European capital for develop
ing its resources,- which are illimitable
and capable of great expansion.
Islands of the Fiji Group.
The colony of Fiji includes a small de
pendency of Rotumah, â¢ situated - to the
northwest of the group, of an area of
fourteen square miles, and consisting of
three islets and rocks and reefs. The
island is administered by a Deputy Com
missioner, acting under. the orders of the
High Commissioner,* the local enactments
of the Rotumahan Regulation board for
the government of the natives being sub
ject to the approval of the Legislative
Council of Fiji. The sole care of gov
ernment is that of the interesting race
over â¢ whose . destinies they : preside. The
regulations governing this island -and the
community are based on*those of Fiji. The
main ! products are cocoanuts, whose an
nual yield more than pays for its admin
istration, as -well as leaving a large sum
for the material benefit, of the natives.
The principal islands 'of the Fiji group
are VI ti Levu, of 4112 square miles; Venua
Levu, of 2432 square miles:. Taviuni, 217
square miles; Kadavu. 124 square miles:
Koro, 58 square, miles; Â» Gau, 45 square
miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles, /the to
tal area of the colony being about equal
to that of Wales. The Island of Viti Levu
alone is as large as Jamaica, larger than
Cyprus, twice as large, as Trinidad and
six times as large as Â« Mauritius. The
whole group is greater than that of all the
West Indian Islands put' together.
The population of , the group in 'the va
rious races is as follows: Europeans,"
4000; half-castes, 1500; Indians. 13,000; Poly
nesians/2074; Fijlans, S8.950; Rotumahans,
2200; others. 1100. Total population, 122,824.
Climate of the Colony.
For a tropical country the colony is a
particularly healthy one for Europeans.
Malarial fevers are practically unknown
and the endemic Â¦ diseases . peculiar to the
natives are extremely rare in Europeans,
such as occasionally occur being those at
tributable to association among the na
tives or the adoption of their " methods of
life. The climate is somewhat damp- the
rainfall In . Suva in 1898 was no inches â
but w,ith a large amount of 'annual sun
shine and no excessive heat and with cool
steady southeast. trade winds most of the
year. . v Â¦ Â¦ ., â¢ â¢ â¢ . Â¦ .-..â¢.
The principal industries of the colony
are the following:
1. The cultivation and manufacture of
raw sugar. 2. The making of copra, the
dried nut from the cocoanut palm. 3. The
cultivation and export of gTeen fruit. < 4
The . manufacture of distilled I spirit is a
by-product from sugar. 5. The export of
the peanut, largely prized for its oil and
in the manufacture . of confectionery. 6.
Pearl shell, turtle shell and beche-de-mer
7. The growth and manufacture of supe
rior ' classes - of . . tobacco. 8. Rice Is also
largely cultivated.
Labor and Immigration.
The labor of the colony Is derived'ehief
ly. from the immigrant Indian and Poly
nesian races and the local -Fijlans. The
principal labor. on the larger estates is of
course, coolie labor, carried on by the
Government annual importation - and in
denture to the various employers who aD
ply for men, to whom they^are bound for
a period of five; years, after which tha

I^ATJITUDEâ C. H. A., City. The ques

change say. one degree or so in a hun
dred years?" was submitted to W. W.
Campbell, director of the Lick Observa
tory of the University of California, who
has kindly replied as follows:
"Your correspondent is misinformed re
garding the magnitudes of latitude
changes on the earth's surface.'. Changes
amounting to, say, 'one degree or so In
a hundred years/ are entirely unknown.
On the contrary, we know from accurate
astronomical observations that latitudes
have not changed to the amount of one
second of arc in the last century and a
half, and we have no reason Â¦ to â¢ suppose
that secular, or long, period changes are
taking place. About fifteen years ago, as
tronomers discovered that terrestrial lati
tudes were undergoing some changes,
these- changes being of a very irregular
rature.^and in no case amounting to more
than seventy feet, or two-thirds of a sec- .
ond of arc, from one extreme to the other.
.This change is not progressive, but a
movement in one direction is corrected a
few months later by a movement in the
opposite direction. The laws governing
these cnanges are fully understood, and it
is not possible to" predict them even ap
proximately many years in advance.
"We do know that the ellipsoidal form
of the earth is to some extent responsi
ble for the changes, and it is possible
that the annual falling and melting of the
snow around the polar regions exert an
appreciable influence, but 'the complete
explanation of the phenomenon is still
wanting." , t
OUR ANNUAL < FIRE BILL.
S'.TATISTICS said to have been compiled by in
surance experts, and.now. going the rounds of
.,] the Eastern press, make a -startling showing of
the losses to the people^of the United States, by fires
in the year 1900. The total loss is placed at $1^0,929,
805, on which there was insurance to the, amount of
$95,403,650. It is to be tome in mind the amount in
cludes only losses by the burning of buildings, bridges,
wharves and other property of that' kind. It does not
include any of the loss through the burning of our
woods and forests. . ' - ;
About the only consolation one can-find in a review
of the list of losses is that the thing seems to be gen
eral. There is no apparent 'partiality about it, and the
rich and the poor, the wise and the foolish, Demoy
crats arid Republicans, are- all alike- entitled to share
in any disguised blessing the loss- may bring.
A summary given of the property destroyed is irr
t'eresting. It includes, among other things, 151 fair
and exposition buildings, 15 armories, .9 art galleries,
78 .asylums, 79 college 'buildings, 143 clubhouses, 9

VACCINATION AND .
SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC
The Call dees not. hold itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
Â¦ presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general Interest.
[ Editor Daily Morning Call: The subject
of your editorial on "Prevalence of Small
pox" in your edition of Saturday calls for
further elucidation, for you omitted two .
most important factors. . ,
First, during our late Spanish and Phil
ippine wars wholesale vaccination was
practiced in our army, ' navy and â¢ public
schools, and the inevitable result through
out the United States is a crop of sporadic
but non-infectious smallpox. This is an
Indisputably established fact and known
to all intelligent physicians. . . -â¢,
Second, the smallpox (variola) of old,
which caused Jenner to seek an antidote,
is quite different from the smallpox of to
day, which is non-contagldus. Contagion
results from ' hallucinative fear and is
suggested into susceptible people by tim
id and frightened observers of this dis
ease, and thus, as a natural consequence,
smallpox is of, itself produced. And this
again has been thoroughly established
through modern scientific investigations
in metaphysics, psychology and suggest
tive therapeutics. '
School children are taught that a tem
perature of 100 degrees' indicates fever,
and is in Itself disease. "Vaccination pro
duces fever and higher temperatures,
often up to 104.. 105 and even to 106 de- .
grees, hence loss of health, depletion and/
depolarization of the body, and thus is
created in the negative patient a ten
dency to disease-producing fear and ulti
mately to contagion. The. demand of to
day is for physicians capable of curing
smallpox through common-sense methods
and wholly without* resort to experi
mentation, or -to this fallacious and dis
ease-jjroducing vaccination. One of â¢ the
first %teps toward that result is the doing
away with compulsory vaccination. Com
pulsory vaccination lulls the public (and
often the physician) into a mirage of fan
cied security and stops progress toward
searching for truly curative methods. Â¦

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
THE Post-Intelligencer. of Seattle, rejoicing *in
the claim^bf Tacoma ; tb commercial supremacy
on Puget Sound, joins the press of that city
in its claim that San Francisco is decadent as a com
mercial arid financial center. . We have no' desire to
magnify the energy of San Francisco, nor to mini
mize any lack of it that : may appear in ourcommer-'
cial statistics. The -Pacific Coast, must have a grow-'
ing commerce, divided among > the cities of the
Sound, of Oregon and of California. We are per;
suaded thaf no matter with what others that trade
will be shared, this city will always hold to it all. the
same relation that New York does to the commerce of
the Atlantic. There will be Bostons, ';. Baltimores, \
Charlestons, Savannahs and Galvestons.on this west
coast, we hope, but San Francisco,, by reason of con
ditions admitted by the : Seattle paper, ..will always
hold her commercial and financial primacy. Conced
ing that our inward and outward commerce far ex
ceeds that of the combined Sound ports, the/ Post--
Intelligencer points out that its volume is in part due
to our handling the through traffic in addition to the
export of our own products and the import of the re
turn exchange.
It says: "By far the greater portion of the sail
tonnage of Puget Sound, which is generally in excess
of that of San Francisco, is devoted to carrying our
exports of lumber, flour and wheat, all articles of do
mestic production. Every dollar received from- this
export trade is a dollar added to the wealth of the
State, distributed to local producers and to local la
bor. While less in actual value than cargoes of mer
chandise, each of those cargoes means the distribu
tion of more money at home than is received from
handling many cargoes of exports of other cities,
which merely pÂ£ss through Pacific ports on the way
to Asia." * - â¢
That is a proper statement of a wholesome condi
tion, which we hope will wax and not wane on the
Sound. The lasting commercial prosperity of any
point of exchange and distribution must depend upon
the immediate productive zone of which it receives
the commercial drainage. In stating the case of the
Sound ports that of San Francisco is also stated.
The total exports of the Puget Sound ports in 1900
were $17,829,232, and those of San Francisco were
$39,487,246. Of wheat, barley, wheat flour, fish; fruits,
leather, dairy products, vegetables and lumber, all do
mestic products, in the above amounts,, the exports
stood:
San Francisco.. ?20,054,4S5
Puget Sound 7,313,199
These domestic products were over fifty per cent of
San Francisco's total export and were a little more
than forty per cent of the total export of Puget
Sound. "*
San Francisco shipped also 2863 carloads of brandy
and wine by sea, but as we have not the value they
are not included. This city shipped no lumber, that
export going entirely from Eureka. It will be seen,
then, that accepting the Seattle statement that com
mercial prosperity is measured by the percentage of
local products handled, San Francisco is able to make
as good a showing as she does in her total inward
and outward trade. Â¦
In the same matter the showing by the Sound ports
is highly commendable. But California will always
probably have an advantage in that respect for cli
matic and physical reasons. The forests of the north
are destroyed by the very. processes which make their
product the large figure-?! they are in Puget Sound
exports, while the fertility of our soil, the clemency
of our climate and the productiveness of our waters
are permanent qualities.

a dozen apprentices of the crew of the
Alert went out for a sail in one of the
ship's barges. While sailing through Car
quinez Straits a squall struck the barge,
and she capsized. Nine of the boys suc
ceeded in climbing on the bottom of the
capsized boat and the other three tried to
swim to the beach. Two succeeded, but
the third, named A. E. Waldron, became
exhausted and sank.

The other indictment is for perjury and

held pending his arrest.
Dave Musto. a saloonkeeper, and James
Kelly, a iocal Democratic politician,
were arrested on indictments charging
them with violation of the election laws.
At the last State and county election,
Musto. Kelly, and a man named Kennedy,
now said to be in San Francisco, were
officers; on the election board in the Sec
â¢nd Precinct of the First Ward. After
closing the polls Musto. Kelly and Ken
nedy are alleged to have left the ballots
and returns scattered about the polling
place. Musto and Kelly are in jail.
sheriff Sibley left to-night for San Fran
cisco to arrest Kennedy.
At a subsequent trial of Ennis, Attorney
Carpenter took the witness stand and
*wore that the confession of Stennett was
false. The District Attorney then threat
ened in open court to charge Attorney
Carpenter with perjury, and the latter re
taliated bv- commencing suit against the
District A^Korney for 510,000 damages for
blander. All parties were given a hear
ing before the Grand Jury and the result
was the indictments.
A. H. Carpenter, a well-known attor
ney, was arrested on two indictments,
one charging perjury and the other subor
nation of perjury. He gave bail in the
.sum of SGOU and was released. The per
jury charges against Carpenter, Ennis
and Davis grew out of the famous LodI
hog cases. Ennis, Davis and Jack Sten
nett were arrested last winter for the
wholesale theft of hogs and other live
stock from farmers near Lodi. Attorney
Carpenter defended them. The testimony
of Stennett, while corroborated by that
at Ennis and Davis, was so at variance
with the facts in the cases that District
Attorney Ashley ordered Stennett ar
rested on a charge of perjury while the
latter was on the witness stand. Sten
nett weakened in the jail. and. under the
District Attorney's promise to exempt
him from -prosecution, confessed a whole
sale conspiracy of perjury. He stated
that Attorney Carpenter had coached him
vnd the two oth^r defendants in the lies
that they later swore to on the stand.
STOCKTON. June 10.â The Grand Jury
this afternoon returned eight indict
ments, five for perjury and three for vio
lation of the election iaws. Warrants
were at once given the Sheriff and three
of the accused men were arrested within
an hour. Two of the Indicted men, Arthur
Ennis and Paul Davis, are now serving

SERIOUS CRIME
LOS ANGELES, June 10.â "You say that
freight rates of the railroad^are reason
able, do you, Mr. Sproule?" asked Inter
state Commerce Commissioner Prouty of
the general traffic manager of the South
ern Pacific Railroad at the hearing to-day.
"They are more than reasonable," said
the official, and then he proceeded to show
how, in his opinion, the railroad in every
case gives the benefit of the lowest pos
sible rate to the shipper.
The case at issue was that of the Red
Cloud Mining Company, S. P. Creasinger,
president, versus the Southern Pacific
Railroad. Judge Prouty of the Interstate
Commerce Commission was In the State
as a member of the party of State Rail
road Commissioners now on their home
ward way, and as this case was up for a
hearing he decided to take testimony and
sat for that purpose In the Federal
Court's room in the Tajo building.
The case did not differ materially from
that which was brought up by San Ber
nardino merchants some months ago and
was decided adversely to that city a few
days since. Several months ago the Red
Cloud Mining Company bought a carload
of machinery in Erie, Pa., which it had
shipped to Salton, on the Colorado des
ert. Mr. Creasingrer claimed that when he
ordered the shipment made he was told
at Assistant Passenger and Freight Agent
Luce's office that the road would deliver
the freight at Salton as cheaply as any
road would deliver it in Los Angeles. This
evidence was denied by Mr. " Ochsiltree,
Luce's private clerk, with whom the con
versation, regarding the shipment of the
machinery occurred. It was on this issue
that Sproule was called to the stand and
gave an interesting statement of the rail
road's position in the matter.
While it was the simple task of Judge
Prouty to take evidence in the case, ren
dering no opinion, which can only be
given by a majority of the commissioners,
the fact that he showed that the schedule
rate must be paid according to the Su
preme Court decision, regardless of any
other rate quoted, and the further fact
that in the San Bernardino case the same
issue was raised and decided against the
side now taken by the Red Cloud Mining
Company, left the representatives of that
company rather disappointed with the
prospects.

The mystery attaching to the purchase and
cor.sol idation of some of the Independent steel
oom;ianies was made much of by the bears, who
circulated rumors that a breach In the steel
trade was imminent between the two financial
jrroup* which figured in the Northern Pacific
quarrel. The steel stocks lost lÂ»i and 1H re
ft*ctlvcly for the common and preferred dur
ing the period of weakness, but rallied to a
fraction over Saturday.
Â¦ The bears were also inclined to discount their
?uj>poFltlon that the Government crop report,
which was not due until after closing of the
Ft<x-k market, would disclose a decided deterio
ration In the condition of cereal crops. Some
Fharp gains that had been established in the
Southwestern group were wiped out by the
pressure to sell, stocks in that group declining
in sympathy with the general list. Hock Island
fell a* much a> 4% from the best. St. Paul 3%
and Missouri Pacific VA. The leading Indus
trials Fhowed rather acute depression. Sugar
falling nearly 4. Amalgamated Copper 3% and
American Tobacco. People's Gas and the Sew
York jiubllc utilities from 1% to 2%. The late
rally left the net change* Flgnlficant In only a
few stocks. Missouri Pacific rose very strongly
to 120 in the late dealings, which was 2% points
over Saturday. The Southwestern stocks gen
erally. Southern Pacific, Atchlson and Union
Pacific, made notably good recoveries and Penn
sylvania was lifted a point over Saturday. Â¦ The
Hoslnp. nevertheless, was slightly Irregular,
tho market yielding a gain in spots. American
Linseed rose Â£% and the Â« preferred 8 on the
buying of only a lew hundred shares.
NEW YORK. June 10.â There was some liqui
dation in the stock market to-day, as was fore-
Fhadowed by the drop in prices on Saturday,
after the bank statement appeared. The bear
party which sold stocks at that time continued
their efforts to pet prices to lower levels to-day
and extend their profits. A number of develop
ments helped them in this purpose, but after
the pressure of the selling had been relaxed
and the t-upporters of stocks began to bid up
prices again the bears took alarm and began
to cover their short lines, causing very general
recoveries of loEses and in a few stocks quite
notable net gains. As long as trading was going
un in the London stock market the feeling of
depi-ess-ion continued. London was quite a
large seller in this market and there was a
Jeeling of some uneasiness lest the gloomy tone
there foreshadowed some unfavorable develop
ment. This weeks London Stock Exchange set
tlement is somewhat dreaded, although assur
ancf is given that the shorts in Northern Pa
cific are fully prepared to meet the decision to
day Â«f the Stock Exchange committee for gen
t-ral purtwses In ending the moratorium granted
to the Northern Pacific shorts after the corn
developed in the stock. The persistent heavi
ness of console in face of the growing ea*e of
money in London gives rise to some dread of
a secret development in diplomacy or internal
Government policy. The heavy demands dis
closed by the bank statement on banking re
sources here caused uneasiness, as it was not
known how much further they might proceed.
.Payments fcr the I60.CjO.000 worth of new Penn
sylvania stock are required between June 1
and June 5, so that the needs on that account
miÂ£ht run over a period to come. The easy
rate for money to-day caused a more cheer
ful feeling, however, and encouraged the hope
that the requirements for large corporate trans
actions have been mostly satisfied for the pres
ent. This was a potent factor in the latter
rally of the market when the adjournment of"
the Ixindon stock market had relaxed the pres
srre here.

the cause of the death of Hugh Tevis in
Yokohama. Word has "been received at
Denver In a cablegram addressed to for

SACRAMENTO, June 10.â There was a
stir in the residence portion of town this
afternoon when Louis B. Nichols, a well
known citizen, was seen rushing: out of
his house, pistol in hand, after a young
dentist named Edward Diaz. Nichols
aimed and pulled the trigger of the re
volver several times, but the young den
tist, hat and coat in hand, fled with the
speed of a greyhound before the wrath
ful husband and disappeared down an
When the police arrived Nichols said he
had come home 'from his place of business
and finding the doors locked had, broken
in the rear door. As he did so Diaz'
rushed out at the front. Mrs. Nichols and
a young woman ran screaming from the
house and sought shelter at a corner gro
cery, whence a hurry call for. the police
was sent in. Mrs. Nichols asserts that
there was no occasion for jealousy on the
part of her husband; that young Diaz has
been keeping company with her cousin,
Miss Costello, who was In the house at
the time, and that the young dentist was
making himself useful by wringing some
clothes that the women were washing-.
Mrs. Nichols swore to a complaint charg

but. withdrew it to-night, a reconciliation
having taken place.
Nichols says somebody had removed the
charges from his cartridges, and that he
snapped the pistol so many times in an

punch the shells out, of the cylinder with
a ramrod. Â¦

In speaking of the priesthood, the apostle
says: No man taketh this honor save he be
called, even as Aaron was. It is not a tran
sitory office, to be taken up lightly and laid
down hurriedly. Thou art a priest forever
according to the Order of Melchisedec. The
Catholic Idea of the priesthood is wholly op
posed to our modern order of viewing profes
sions. A man may be a physician to-day and
also to-morrow; to-day a preacher, to-morrow
a politician. The Catholic church lays hands
Therefore, to-day we are met to celebrate
the record of the work well done in the priest
hood. This jubilee is for himself and for us.
Five and twenty years ago his hands were
anointed, that blessing ' he might bless, and
consecrating, he might consecrate, and these
twenty-five years have been years of benedic
tion for this city, where his lot was cast, and
for this people, where he has ruled as shep
herd of the flock. ,Â¦ , , .
It was a gracious custom, instituted by God
himself, that in the old dispensation certain
years were set aside . for rest and rejoicing.
The trumpet eounded through the land and
proclaimed liberty to all and the inhabitants
thereof. The jubilee was a time of rest, of
peace, of joy. The old dispensation has been
merged in the new. Its rites have taken a
wider signification. The temple courts are
silent. The trumpet is silent on Zion, but itsÂ»
echoes roll from soul to soul and grow for
ever and forever. It Is well there should be
in this world a season of jubilee. It is a
workaday world. We all must labor. In the
sweat of thy brow shalt thoir'eat bread until
thou return to the dust from whence thou
wert taken. The heaviest burden laid upon
us by the command to work is the monotony
of work. Hour by hour, day by day we drag
a lengthening and a heavier chain. We need
encouragement, we need to break the monot
ony. We must snap the chain.. No encourage
ment given is so sweet as the consciousness
of work well done by others. "We are encour
aged by seeing others bearing their burdens
bravely to take up our own and struggle on.
Father Yorke then dellve.-erl a sermojs
appropriate to the occasion, and the Arch
bishop followed with- -a short address oi
eulogy. He spoke in the highest terms tl
Father Casey as a man and' a priest and'
of his work in the parish, which, he said'
bore evidence of the great cire taken'
of it. I
Following is in part the sermon deliv
ered by Father i'orke: â¢
Addresses of Commendation.
The altar had been tastefully Jeorated
by the Misses Maguire and Mrs. I>. Kee
nan, and with its myraid of lighs pre
sented a striking appearance. A 10:30
the organ pealed forth a gladsome tarch,
and the acolytes, visiting priests anv par
ticipants in the high mass marchec, into
the sanctuary, preceding the Archbihop,
who was attired in his pontificial roles.
Father Casey was celebrant of the Jiass,
Rev. P. Lynch of St. James was delcon,
deacon and Rev. T. Larkin of St. Peer's
Rev. William Lyons of St. Peter's mb
master of ceremonies. Rev. James Mc-
Donald of St. Charles Church and lev.
P. P. Powers of Livermore were assist
ants to the Archbishop. At the close of
the mass the "Te Deum' 1 was Intoned *iy
Father Casey, and the impressive chait
was taken up by the choir.
FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS ago
his hands were anointed, that
blessing he might oless and con
secrating he . mig.t consecrate,
and these twenty-fre years have
been years of benediction for this city,
where his lot was cast and where he lias
ruled as shepherd of the floa."
The foregoing is part of i tribute paid
by Rev. Peter C. Yorke tc Rev. P. S.
Casey, pastor of St. Petr's Church,
whose silver jubilee was celbrated yes
terday by a solemn high rass in the
parish he upbuilt.
The sacred edifice that Faher Casey
helped build was crowded withthe peoplo

revere him. His Grace Archbliiop Rlor
dan lent his presence to the ausicious oc
casion and praised the pasta- for h's
splendid work. Members of the'iloth oc
cupied seats in the sanctuary nd took
part in the solemn services. Sp6ial mu
sic was rendered by an augmentd choir
under the leadership of Miss Osmond,
and Miss Annie Rooney, the sweefeuiger,
rendered some special numbers. J
PORT ROYAL., Pa., June 11.â Shortly af
ter 3 o'clock this morning W. A. Sweeney,
Harry Beveridge and Frank Stratton sue
ceeded in working their way to the pit
mouth and were quickly put under the
care of physicians. Beveridge and Strat
ton are unconscious and the physicians
say they cannot live. Beverldge's arms
are both broken, his body horribly bruiscJ
and it is believed he inhaled the flames.
Sweeney rescued Beveridge and literally
carried him along with him. Sweeney him
self is so badly used up that all the in
formation he could give of the explosion
and fire was that the esplosion came just
at the time when the shifts were chang
ing from day to night turn. The miners
were hurled in all directions, and Sweeney
knows of at least three who were killed
outright. He says It is impossible to tell
now just how many men are entombed,
but he thinks there are more than the
thirty-seven reported at first.
At 11 o'clock to-night four men volun
teered to go down shafts Nos. 1 and 2
and one man went down shaft No. 3, but
up to this time it is not known whether
they have succeeded in making any res
cue. Gas and smoke are issuing from the
mine at midnight, and over 200 women
and children are gathered about the
mouth of the shaft. Physicians have been
summoned and every effort is being made
to reach the entombed men.
Daly, one of the men known to be In
the burning mine, went in for the first
time this morning:, and it is not known
who he is or where he is from.
After 7 o'clock Superintendent McComb
of West Newton; Dennis Wortley, pit
boss; Michael Roy, foreman of the Euclid
n-ines, and several other bosses, with
about twenty men, went down shaft No.
1, v.hich is just opposite on the Baltimore
and Ohio side of the river, and have not
been heard from since.' About three hours
after the rescue party had been in the
mine more explosions were heard. Mean
time the crowd around the opening of the
shaft had increased, the crowd including
many mothers, wives and sisters of the
men entombed. All sorts of plans have
been sugested for the rescue of the men.
Some talk of turning the river into the
mines, but many are opposed to this for
fear of drowning the miners. All that
would be necessary to let the deluge of
water loose in the mines would be to pull
a plug which was placed in the mines
after the explosion of seven years ago
and the water would rush in the mines
at a rapid rate.
It is thought the flre started from an
explosion, fcsix men were in the mine at
the timeâ Jack Peoples, Tony Sickles,
Frank Davenport, â Daly, L>awrence Set
tler and John Stakes. Stakes and Settler
were not near the place where the ex
plosion occurred, ana upon the arrival of
a rescue party they were quickly brought
to the surface. They were nearly over
come by afterdamp. They could give no
information as to what had caused the
fire and told the rescuers that four other
men were entombed.

2 at this place is again on flre. More than
thirty men are in the mine, many of
whom, it Is- feared, will never be heard
from again. The names of those known

President Shaffer said: "We don't
v.ant to confiscate the property of the
water company. They donated the money
to make up the deficit in our high school
fund. As to this resolution we have the
opinion of an eminent attorney that it is
our duty to pass it and that it can In no
way affect the decision of the Supreme
<"ourt on the appeal of the rate case."
Councilman Dornin said: "This talk
about criminal liability is ludicrous. We
cant fix rates to go into effect the first
t\t last July and we can't be punished for
â¢what our predecessors neglected to do.
We have the opinion of our City Attorney
to this effect. In the matter of the appeal
we have no right to weaken the hands
of our attorney. He told us that if this
ordinance were passed it would be a con
fession that the contested ordinance is
invalid. This is a judicial question and
â¢we have no business with it."
Courtnev. replying to Wallace, said:
"The member from the Seventh Ward
comes here and insults the other members
all around. He seems to think that every
body in the Seventh Ward is an angel."
I'ourtney presented an opinion from At
torney George E. de Golia, stating that
unless the Councilmen passed a water
rate ordinance for the current year they
would be liable to a fme of $500 each with
costs and loss of office.
Councilman Fitzgerald asked why the
matter had been rushed through in such
a hurry. "I am a member of the Ordi
nance and Judiciary Committee and I had
no notice of the meeting at which this
resolution was approved."
By the same vote an ordinance to the
Fame effect was passed to print. This
action was taken after a bitter fight, dur
ing- which the minority accused their col
leagues of impairing the chance of suc
cessfully appealing the rate case. Coun
cilman Wixeon. arguing for the resolu
tion, paid that the city had no case
against the water company and never
had one. "All we had to fight on was a
lot of mugrgrle-juggled affairs we called a
case," he declared.
Councilman Wallace said: "Let us not
stultify ourselves by taking an action
which will kill our case. Xot a man In
this Council could have been elected had
the people known that he would make
such proposals here as the majority are
making to-night."
Wixson said: "Professor Wallace la
vulneraWe. as -well a.s the rest of us. I
accuse him of inconsistency. He has
broken promises himself. He talks tem
perance and then votes for licenses for
s-aloons in his ward."
On the ground that the present Council
men would be criminally negligent In not
nxing water rates for the current year,
and that such action would not injure the
city's chances in case of an appeal of the
water rale case to the Supreme Court, the
majority members of the City Council to
night passed a resolution flxing rates for
the year beginning July 1, 1900, on the
basis of the Hart decision. Cduncllmen

OMAHA, Nebr., June 10.â Rev. Mejem
seh Hendricks, evangelist, has launched
a unique crusade. He is carrying the
gospel to barbers. Mr. Hendricks be
lieves that in country towns the barber
shop and not the saloon is the demoral
izing. Influence among young men. He
proposes to organize the barber shops of
Nebraska into an adjunct of the church.
"I have been in barber shops before
now where the air was ! so ! surcharged
with" Satanic Influences that to spit were
an act of worship," is the forceful .way
in which Mr. Hendricks refers to his
mission. "In the country- towns young
men make these shops .their loafing place
hour after hour and oftentimes acquire
habits that lead to their ruin. They can
do â¢ this and still maintain - their social
standing, which would not be true if they
made the livery stable "ana the sa
loon their trysting place." 'Â¦
'Mr. Hendricks' plan is to establish a
mission or what might be called a chair
of theology in the barber colleges of this
city. He has already secured the de
sired permission from one college and
will set to work at once, assisted by his
brother Charles, who has' recently grad
uated from a Chicago ' seminary.
"I am not aiming at the city barber
shops," said the reformer, "as they exert
none of the pernicious influences felt in
country establishments. The young bar
bers who are now learning -their trades
in Omaha, however, will some day open
shops of their , own in small towns. I
want their influence to be for good rather
than evil. In addition to converting bar
bers I hope to .teach them the funda
mentals of. theology so that they them
selves may carry forward the Lord's
work." Â¦ Â¦

St. Peter's Academy Closing Ends
Father Casey Celebra
tion.
The closing exercises of St. Peter's
Academy were made doubly interesting
last night by the entertainment given by
the , pupils on the occasion of the silver
jubilee of Father Casey. Long before
the opening of the programme every
available seat was occupied and standing
room was at a premium. St. Peter's Hall
was beautifully decorated with . festoons
of evergreen and colored bunting in
honor of the pastor, who is held in such
high regard by his flock.
The feature of the entertainment was
the presentation of a drama in one act
entitled Â»'The Second Spring," written by
Father Yorke as a testimonial to his as
sociate in good works. The drama, which
fittingly portrayed the learning and eru
dition of the composer, was in five
scenes, the first of which showed "The
Passing of the Â¦ Friars. "â¢ The scene:
depicted the "Camino Real". leading from
San Francisco, in the year . 1838. As an
interlude "The Festival Day" â¢was sung
by Misses R. McCarthy, M. Mclntyre, N.
Dillon. D. Driscoll, I. Farrell and C.
Bair. Scene two, "The Vision of the Fu
ture," showed a hill in view of the Mis
sion Dolores and the sea. A Scotch
dance was rendered by Misses I. Fop
piano, M. Keenan,' A. Guthrie and L. Far
rell; The third scene typified the coming
into the priesthood of Father Casey in
1876. Scene four was an eminence in sight I
of St. Peter's School in 1878, the tableau
being "Suffer Little Children." The last
scene was a beautiful picture entitled
"The Silver Years." The cast of charac
ters was as follows:

secret of the marriage. \ â¢
It is a pretty little love story, not new
but always interesting. They were school
mates and sweethearts. At first their
parents paid no attention to the court
ship, but as years passed along the pater
nal eye discovered the germ, of true love.
Then four parents objected. The girl was
too young, she is now hardly nineteen,
and the boy is only two years older. The
children were C advised, coaxed/ threat
ened, but to no purpose. Their courtship
was not -to be. stopped. Last" January
they took advantage of a holiday, and
traveled as far as San Mateo, where they
were married. He returned to the grocery
store and she to the school. -;Â¦; â¢..:.-

o
'Â¦;Â¦ Millions of little glands or tubes connect the blood withthe skin, and through
these small drain pipes perspiration passes out, carrying with it the impurities that
are thrown off by the blood. Should the pores of the skin be entirely closed for
even a brief space of time, and the poisonous matter forced back into the circula-
tion instant death would result. In addition to the sweat glands, the skin is
provided with certain others which pour out upon it an oily substance, keeping
â¢the skin pliable and soft and protecting it from heat and cold. The blood and skin
, are so closely related that whatever affects one seriously interferes with the func-
tions of the other. Not only health, but life itself, depends upon perfect harmony
between the blood and skin. When, therefore/ the. tmmdgmmmmm - Â§
blood becomes poisoned from any cause,. it quickly intBrnmi mnU

eruptive diseases. By the character of the ; Â¦ \ . ,
sore we are enabled to determine the nature of the poison or humor in the blood,
' as every disease originating in the blood has its own peculiar sore or pimple. The
skin is not only affected by the poisons generated in the system, but poisons from
without enter through the open glands or pores and quickly infect the blood.
Mercury nibbed upon the skin 'will produce Rheumatism, and Poison Oak andilvy
and other wild plants gain easy access to the blood through the skin. As so-called
.; ; - '; -â¢Â» skin diseases originate in the blood, the application

of the skin. The treatment must begin with the bloodi and the acid or other pois-
ons antidoted or neutralized. S. S. S. does this and purifies the circulation, builds
up the blood and flushes the little, glands or. pores with pure, new blood, and
restores healthy action to the skin. vThe use of cosmetics never yet brought health
and beauty to a rough,* red, pimply skin or sallow complexion. What is needed
is rich pure blood, such as S. S.'S. makes. It not only relieves you of all disfigur-
ing blackheads, blotches and irritating, itching eruptions, but improves your general
health S. S.' contains no mercuiy, potash, arsenic or other mineral, but is a
purely vegetable remedy and the* safest and best in all blood and skm troubles.

The barber, shop in the Carrollton hotel,
Baltimore, sterilizes everything it uses In
the shop. The sterilizing is done by heat.
The towels, the razors, the strops, the
soap, the combs and brushes are cJl steril-
ized ' before beine used on a customer.
Where there is no sterilization, have the
barber use Newbro's Herpicide. It kills
the dandruff germ, and it is an .intisepMc
for the scalp, and for the face after shnv-
lng. All leading barbers everywhere ap-
preciate these potent facts about Herpi-
cide and they use it. "Destroy the cause,
you remove the effect." ,

Judge Seawell banded down a decision
yesterday, removing all copyists in those
offices declared in the recent decision of
the Supreme Court to be "county offices"
from the jurisdiction of the Civil Service
Commission. Through this decision,
which was reached on demurrer in the
action instituted by W. H. Garnett, a
copyist in the Recorder's office, to com
pel Treasurer Brooks to pay his demand
upon the treasury for services rendered,
the Civil Service Commission loses the
right of appointment to positions num
bering about 100. In his decision Judge
Seawell says:
This is an application for a writ of mandate
to compel the defendant to pay the amount
of plaintiff's demand for sen-ices rendered by
him as copyist in the office of the Recorder.
The demand has been allowed by the Auditor,
and the only objection raised to its payment
is that plaintiff was not legally appointed.
Plaintiff was appointed such copyist with
out being examined by the Civil Service Com
mission as to his eligibility. The question,
therefore, to be determined Is whether the
provisions of article XIII of the charter, in
reference to civil service, apply to the appoint
ment of copyists In .the Recorder's office.
The case of Crawley against Freud is. In my
opinion, decisive of that question. It has been
held that the Recorder is a county officer and
that it was not competent for the charter to
provide for the qualifications of either the
Recorder or his deputies.
It is also urged that if plaintiff's appoint
ment-was made under the laws of the State,
as distinguished from the provisions of the
charter, his demand was improperly audited
and should not be raid because It does not
refer to any law authorizing the same, but to
certain provisions of the charter. By the-
State law in force when the charter took
effect the compensation of copyists in the' Re
corder's office was 12 cents per folio. The
rate fixed by the charter is only 8 cents per
folio In the act of 1861 the persons who per
form the duties of copyists are denominated
deputy clerks. I think that the word "depu
ties," as used in section SM of article XI of
the constitution should be liberally construed
so as to include all the subordinates of a
county officer: and such seems to have been
the view of the Supreme Court in sustaining
the injunction prohibiting the commissioners
from holding examinations for employes of the
Recorder.
Thus construed, it was competent for thi
charter under the rule of Crowley against
Freud to provide for the appointment and
compensation of copyists in the Recorder's
office, but not for their qualifications. The
demurrer will therefore be overruled and a
writ of peremptory mandate issued as prayed

Citizens should keep in mind that the
battle for good government must be
fought at the primary election. So far
as registration is concerned, there is not
much time to lose. Every voter who has
changed -his place of residence since the
general election in November last should
register anew. All citizens who were reg
istered as voters last November and who
have not since changed their respective
places of residence will be entitled to vote
at the primary election. In the line of
awakening Interest . in registration .. the
Republican Primary .League will render
efficient service. A new system of reach
ing neglectful and indifferent citizens will
be tested. Members of the league are fully
aware of the fact that Republican success
in November next will depend upon the
character of the party convention chosen
in . August. Hence special effort will be
put forward by the league to induce all
the friends of good government In the
party to interest themselves in the pri
mary election. .....'
Battle for Good government.
All intelligent citizens know, that one of
the committees contending for the right
to be recognized as- the governing body
of the Republican party in this city is
composed of men wno were appointed to
register the will of bosses." Another com
mittee claiming the same right has been
demoralized by general incompetency of
leadership. Associations in the interest
of several aspirants for ofiice are taking
shape under : the mantle of reform. | Re
publicans having no axes to grind, no fac
tions to uphold and no personal aspira
tions to advance fancied that some
.method should be devised to give the
workmgmen, .merchants and taxpayers
generally an opportunity to put forward
Kepublican delegate tickets to be voted
for at the primary election on August 12.
The Republican Primary League was
therefore created to give the. citizens a
chance to wrest control of the party from
the bosses and # create a Republican mu
nicipal convention that will be free to
nominate representative men to fill the
offices of the city government.
The primary election law insures a fair
count of the votes cast for delegates to
the nominating convention, but something
more is reaulred to insure a. convention
composed of representative citizens. Goo<l
men to serve as delegates must be placed
on the district tickets. In every district
the Republican Primary League of San
Francisco will put forward a ticket, and
voters can judge by the character and
standing of the men proposed whether
the league is on the right course or not.
Delegates to the Conventions.
- As set forth in the articles of Incorpora
tion, the league is formed "to foster and
maintain the political principles of the
Republican party, to arouse and maintain
the interest of all electors in the mainte
nance and enforcement of the . primary
election law and of all laws relating to
elections." As long as the league ad
heres to this purpose it will deserve the
respect and support of Republican voters.
In upholding the organization the Repub
lican taxpayers should take an active
part..
The announcement of the- league's for
mation is received with general ; favor.
Assurance j that the - promoters - of the
league 'are not candidates for office and
have no candidates in sight, or in the
background to recommend to the conven
tion of the party is received with special
gratification. The prompt establishment
of central headquarters signifies that the
league means active work , throughout
the campaign. **'
Spacious - permanent headquarters for
the Republican Primary League has
been established in the Baldwin Annex.
Five rooms on the Ellis-street -side of the
building have been appropriately furnish
ed. The main entrance to the headquar
ters is on Market street. The rooms re
served for the use of the. league will be
opened this afternoon and ' kept open

ings. '
In the purchase of the Blythe block the
purchasers come Into possession of 54,345
square feet of land, with a Market street
frontage of 271:S% feet. The Baldwin

num. That portion of the Blythe block
sold last year to the Mutual Savings
Bank for $290,000 has a frontage of 53 feet
on Market street and 74 feet on Geary
street.

was the greatest honor of my life to meet the
Pope of Rome. I was charmed â¢ with the
grandeur of Pius the Ninth. He was - like a
simple priest from his mountain I home, j who
had stepped down there to the Vatican. Ha
was simple- in his manners and put us all at

clung to me ever since. I venerate the memory
of that sweet, holy man. â¢- - . .. â¢ \
I went abroad to St. Michael's Mount and
saw the fervor, of the many pilgrims. I heard
a voice saying to me. "Some day you may be

Rumors were spread as to the character of

took refuge with the Sisters of Charity. \ This

Â¦Why am I a Catholic? It Is a long story and
the evening is far jj too short to give you all

with my lecture I desire to correct an 1 error
published in the papers yesterday.- I was
quoted *as "condemning the system of public
school:]. It would be a grave mistake on my
part to do any such thing:. I am an old pub-
He school - boy of Boston, and I am proud of
the privileges conferred on me by the public
schools of that city. . - ; - :
- My subject to-night will be "From Canter
bury to Rome, or How I Came to Be a Catho
lic." Artemus Ward once delivered a lecture
In London â¢ entitled "The Panorama," and
when he finished a man in the audience ob
jected for the reason that he had seen "no
pictures. The glorious series . of pictures on
the Journey from Canterbury to Rome are no
grander than the sublime scenery you have
here in California. . Like Ward's lecture, you
will not see my pictures, but only hear the
speaker. . ."Â¦'... .'..â¢â.

many years was a minister of the Episco

TRAIN DISPATCHERS ARRIVE HERE
TO HOLD THEIR ANNUAL CONVENTION
They Will Remain 1 in Session Several Days in This City; and
Be Entertained by Local Railroad Men, Leaving for
the East After a Flying Pleasure Trip to Santa Gruz
ABOUT one hundred delegates to
the fourteenth annual convention
of the Train Dispatchers' Asso
ciation arrived in this city on a
â¢ special . train yesterday and are
staying at the Occidental. After they
had rested from their journey they- were
taken In hand t-y their local brethren and
spent the rest of the day sightseeing. :
This morning the convention will open
In Red Men's Hall, 320 Post street, where
the delegates . will be formally welcomed
to the city by Mayor Phelan. The real
business of the convention will then be
transacted.
Train dispatchers hold possibly the
most responsible positions in the railroad
world. In their hands the lives of the
passengers rest. They receive their in
structions from the division superintend
ents, and after- these orders have been
received the train dispatcher is responsi
ble. He is the man behind the gun, and
should he make a mistake a train wreck
and perhaps a big loss of life might re
sult.
Â¦ It Is on account of their heavy respon
sibilities and the different rules used by
each railroad that this convention is held
by the train dispatchers. They hope by
meeting together and discussing proposed
changes to Increase the efficiency of their
work and the general dispatching system.
An extensive programme of entertain
ment has be<jn arranged for the week.
