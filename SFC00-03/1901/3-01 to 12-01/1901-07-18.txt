LEGIONS OF EPWORTH LEAGUE ARE IN READINESS
FOR MOMENTOUS WORK OF THE GREAT CONVENTION,
WHICH BEGINS ITS SESSIONS AT THE PAVILION TO=DAY
Continued on Page Two
a FTER unusual delays en route,
J^ the main body of the Epworth
/^ League arrived in this city with
/ out serious mishap yesterday. A
Â¦^ -^ careful estimate places the num
ber of arrivals at fully 6000 per
sons. Nearly thirty special trains, loaded
to the guards with tired and flusty Leag
uers, puffed into the Oakland ' mole with
headway of from thirty to ninety minutes
each. About ten trains will arrive to-day,
and it is expected that the last- of the vis
itors will reach the city' before midnight
to-night.
The principal delegations from a stand
point of numbers arrived during the morn
ing hours. These specials were met at the
Oakland mole' by the Oakland detail of
the local reception committee and escort-
ed across the bay, where they were di
rected to the Pavilion. Hundreds of the
visitors were received by relatives and
friends at ' whose homes they will make
thrir. headquarters during their stay. The
others were provided 1 with accommoda
tions by the entertainment committee at
the Pavilion. The result was a crush at
headquarters throughout the day, and the
usual confusion attending largo gather-
Ings was, of course,- a conspicuous feature
of the scene.
The committee headquarters waa
thronged with the visiting Leaguer* until
far into the night, .-Their number was
swelled with the arrival of 'every- train,
but tha 'members of the : various' commit-.,
tee* attended to all wants with commend
able celerity, and diBpatch, The uniform
courtesies extended to the visitor* by tha
lrcal committees evoked many expression*
of gratitude and praise.
"I have often heard people speak of the
hospitality of the Callfornlana,". said" a
prominent Leaguer last night, "but I have
never had an opportunity till now of ob
serving that fact personally, Tour people'

rail were hidden beneath a profusion ot
flowers and bunting.
Many ministers from various States
were In the congregation and after Rev.
A. C. Bane had finished his prayer they
entertained with accounts of the Epworth
League's work in their different States.
Among the visitors who spoke and led in
prayer were: Rev. Mr. Wicket of London,
England; Rev. D. L. Martin and Rev. H.
W. Baker of Pennsylvania, Rev. George
Beatty of Ireland. Rev. J. W. Chynoweth
of Sacramento and Rev. Charles McDer

First Methodist Church, gare an interest

and the founding of the historic Powell-
Street Church. Miss W. L. Turney de-Â»
lighted the congregation with a solo. The
usual reception and introduction of dele
gates took place at the conclusion of the
meeting.

At the Howard-Street Church white and

member of the church for the local chap

of â¢ the Los Angeles delegation spoke
eloquently on the reception which the Ep

this city, and complimented the local
leasruers on the success of thelr^efforts.
Many of the Iowa delegates offered
prayer and called down blessings upon the
people of this State, who have so royally
welcomed them. They also paid high
tributes to the climate, resources and
scenery of California.
Pennsylvanians Are Guests.
After the conclusion of the meeting an
informal reception was held In order that
the visitors might be Introduced to their
local brethern, ..
At the prayer meeting, which was held
at the First Methodist Church on Powell
street, the greatest enthusiasm and fervor
were displayed. At this church the Penn
sylvania delegation were" the invited
guests, . Despite the fact that the entire
representation of the Quaker. State had
not yet arrived the church was crowded.
Many delegates other than those from
Pennsylvania were In attendance. Rev. F.
K. Baker, the pastor/ led the meeting and
in: his. opening remarks welcomed the
leaguers to the city.
. - In front - of the altar a beautiful . Ep
worth j League banner of white ' silk was
displayed.' Streamers, of . the league's
colors, suspended from the four walls and
brought together In the center of the
church, formed a canopy over the heads

THE convention with Its elaborate
programme of speeches, music
and routine work is not the only
entertainment which has been
provided for the visiting Epworth
Leaguers. -While the general com
mittee has been arranging the main re
ceptions and amusements, each of the
local league haa been quietly planning
to entertain the visitors J at . Its own
church. ; During â¢ the remainder of the
week receptions, entertainments and
prayer meetings will be held In all the
San Francisco churches. Each church
will invite a delegation from some par
ticular State and in this way it. is hoped
to bring, the leaguers Into closer contact
with each other and to better display the
hospitality "of the city.
In accordance j with this plan a special
prayer meeting was" held last nlght'at the
California-Street M. E. Church, to which
the Iowa delegation was especially in

auspices of the Epworth Church League

THE appearance of the long-await

nigh continuous after 4:15 o'clock
yesterday â¢ morning. In quick
succession the trains bearing the
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Canadian,

THE reception committee force of
aids was increased yesterday by
the addition to that body of the
youngest college president in
America. The young man who en
joys this rare distinction is Pre*
rident Charles. S. Story of the Pa
cific Methodist College at Santa Rosa.
Professor Story is 23 years of age, a na
tiw of Solano County, a Stanford gradu
ate and a savant whose reputation Is fast
making him famous in literary and educa
tional circles. '
â¢ Pi ofessor Story graduated from Stan
ford with the degree of A. B. In 1898, and
with the degree of A. M. in 1900. He is a
professor of English and history and a
scholar of rare attainments. He is par
ticularly noted for his deep researches in
the old English, a^d on the Chaucer po
etry he Is a recognized, authority. His
work and exceptional talents attracted
the attention of David Starr Jordan, who
predicts a brilliant future for the young
man. About a year ago he accepted the
presidency of the Pacific Methodist Col
lege, to the faculty of which his work has
given great satisfaction. This position he
expects to resign next week in order to
go to Harvard with the intention of pur
suing his study of English and history.

Placer Mines on Lynn Canal. J
TACOMA, July 17.â According to reports
received to-day placer mines are to be
developed on the east side of Lynn canal,
near Haines. A stampede has taken place
from Skaguay and dozens of claims have
been filed upon. Â¦
THERE Is trouble brewing among
the transfer men now operating
at the ferry building, and a free
fight may be looked for any day.
One faction calls the other "kick
ers and squealers" and the "kick
ers and squealers" respond with
names that are certainly not parliamen
tary. ,'Â¦ - ,.- t -..;... .-' -.
The situation Is about as follows: When
the Epworth League Convention was
nearly due some one In authority went to
the "outside" transfer men and asked
them to take hold of the handling of the
leaguers baggage. An agreement was
almost reached, the basis being the reg
ular.charge of '25 cents a trunk, when an
other factor appeared on the scene. Thia
was a syndicate composed of the Oceanic
Transfer Company, San Francisco Trans
fer Company, California Transfer Com
pany, Signal Transfer Company, Com
mercial Transfer Company and Golden
Gate Transfer Company. "With the ex
ception of the Oceanic Transfer Company,
whose rate has always been 50 cents a
trunk, all the others are what Is known
as "23-cent companies"; that Is, their
regular rate has hitherto been 25 cents for
moving a trunk to any part of the city.
"With the advent of the syndicate tho
Convention Transfer Bureau dropped Its
negotiations with the "outside" transfer
men â those not connected Â¦with a syndi
cate. Soon after an agreement was
reached by which the syndicate com
panies took hold of the handling of the
baggage, and one and all made a fiat rate
of 50 cents. The California, Signal and
Golden Gate companies never before took
In the water front, but the chance to
make 50 cents where before they were
glad to get 25 cents brought them, around
the ferries with a rush.
Since the Epwortb Leaguers began ar
riving the syndicate has had its men
coming and going about the ferry build
ing at will. The drummers wear tne
league cap and the police do not molest
them. Should an unfortunate "outside"
man show his nose Inside one of the
arches that span the front of the depot,
however, he is greeted with a "Get out
side now or I'll run you in."
The Pacific Transfer Company has al
ways charged 50 cents to move a- trunk,
and is still maintaining Its rate. Morton's
Special Delivery has been and is charging
35 cents. These concerns have secured a
great deal of the business, and the "syn
dicate" has not done as well as It ex
pected, but that does not make any dif
ference with the "outside" men, who
think they have been unfairly dealt with
In the matter.
On the other hand, the "syndicate" as
serts that none of the outside men are
responsible, and that a trunk lost means,
"lost without recourse." In regard to the
doubling of the rates they have little to
say, but claim that the companies are all
under heavy expense In order to make
prompt and careful delivery, and that 50
cents is a fair charge. The "outside" men
say the matter is not ended yet, and that
complaints will be filed with the Police
Commissioners in regard to the police end
of the affair, and an investigation of the
50-'cent charge of the convention de
manded. The charge that they are not
responsible ia laughed to scorn and a
dozen of, them point to the fact that for
years they have done business at the fer
ries and always made a living, paid their
debts and never got into trouble over lost
baggage. The end is not yet.

VISITING STATE DELEGATIONS
The popularity and- favor with, which
the Park .sisters are known in the East
will be faint praise alongside of their Cal
ifornia reception. To hear them once is
but to want to spend an evening enjoying
the melody of their instruments.
There are five of them in the family,
but the oldest is now married and has
retired from the quartet to give place to
the "baby," as the youngest one Is termed.
All but this one have visited Europe twice
and appeared before royalty. In their last
season they appeared In London for six
consecutive months, besides playing in
Paris.
Their names are "Annie, Georgia, Ada
and Kitibel and all of them are members
of the Baptist church. They only play for
religious and social gatherings, but are
in constant demand. Besides the cornets
they have a string quartet, consisting of
the mandolin, zither and two guitars, and
render vocal numbers in duets and trios.
Altogether they are a remarkable family.
The sisters go from here to Long Beaeh
and afterward to Pacific Grove for the
Chautauqua, then to Ocean Grove," New
Jersey.

At the present moment the working pecple
of San Francisco and the Pacific Slope are pro
foundly apprehensive by reason of the ap
proaching expiry of the Chinese exclusion act,
the provisions of wh'ch lapse by limitation on
Hay S. 1902. We feel certain from all experi
ence that unless* the exclusion act is perpet
uated, great numbers cf Chinese will shortly
enter the United States and establish them
eelves in occupations upon which our own citi
zens now depend for a livelihood. For that
reason we have taken all possible steps to ln
eure the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion
act at the coming session of Congress.
We may say here that the sense of the masses
in ?he West is now, as it always has been,
practically unanimous for the maintenance of
Chinese exclusion. Wo recognise, however, that
vre must depend upon the sentiment of the
citizen* of other sections of the country for
the support necessary to carry out this meas
ure of national legislation. For this reason
we address you, and, furthermore, for the rea
son, that, as we are given to believe, a large
public opinion in the East now favors the un
restricted admission of Chinese. We cannot
believe that these representations correctly ex
press the attitude of our fellow-citizens In
other localities. At any rate, we are convinced
that in es far as such sentiment may prevail,
it is ba^ed upon an inadequate knowledge of
the facts. With us the actuating motive Is not
altogether a question of excluding the "cheap
man," although, of course, that question Is a
very important and material factor. The ques
tion that really underlies the whole movement
for Chinese exclusion, and that which we de
eire particularly to bring to the attention />[
the Epworth League because of Its direct bear-
Ing upon the work of your organization, is
mainly a moral one. In brief, it is a question
of health and home. During your stay among
us you will no doubt have an opportunity of
Inspecting Chinatown, where you will be shown
the Chinese in their own homes. With your
permisElon we would ehow you, as well as we
may, the Chinese In our homes. In the only
opportunity at your disposal you will be shown
the Chinese in their plcturesqueness, suavity
and liberality; we would show them in their
filth, vice and poverty. You will be shown the
Chinese In the Sunday schools and missions;
Â¦we would. If need be, show them in the gamb
ling dens and opium Joints. You will be shown
.the part taken by the Chinese as domestics In
the American family; we would ehow the part
taken by them as clave masters in their own
families.
Bring Vices and Diseases.
With us tbe question of Chinese exclusion Is
primarily* a question of preserving pure and
unsullied the ideals of American home life. In
a word. It Is a question of protecting ourselves,
our wives, daughters and sons from contami
nation by the degrading, repulsive and Im
moral characteristics of the lower-class Asiatic.
In. its social aspect the question, of Chinese
Immigration presents a number of well-defined
and generally understood phases that are deep
ly repellant to the cherished standards of the
American people. w * fln< l that the Chinese
bring with them, cultivate and hand down from
generation to generation laws, customs, vices
and even diseases, peculiarly their own and
yet essentially insidious in their effect upon
our people, and that they establish in the midst
of cur communities a social organism based
upon the principle of race preservation and
defiant cf all restraint, moral, legal or execu
tive â an organism that admits tbe American
only to contaminate him and which makes it
self felt ia the surrounding society with the
tame result. -
We desire that the Epworth League, or the
Individual members thereof, shall make all pos
sible Inquiry Into the lives and habits of the
Chinese in this city and vicinity, and their
effect, actual and possible, upon the lives and
habits of our own people. .We would ask, if
upon reflection their Judgment approves the
etep. that the members of the league shall use
their Influence In their respective localities for
the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion act
at the coming cession of Congress. - .
Friends of the Epworth League, the worklng
nwm and the working-women of the Pacific*
Slop* submit their petition and ask you to help
them eave our domain from the threatened In
vasion of Asiatics and conserve its boundless
possibilities for the development cf the greatest
good to our race and people. Very respectfully,

Looking to the Future.
In the hours of relaxation that will diversify

an impartial, yet friendly, eye that which you
may commend, as well as that wnich you must
deplore, in our civic surroundings. You will
cote the thorouchfares that extend with regal
sweep from bay to ocean; the alleys and by
ways that lie between, where dwell the sons
and daughter? of toll; the towering dome and
the groveling tenement; the hive of industry,
-where wealth accumulates, and tbe haunts of
idleness, -where men decay. You will mark, on
one hand, the peaceful haven that bears upon
its bosom a world-wide commerce, hardly ex
ceeded by that of any port In our country, and,
on the other, the great Pacific, whose majestic
swells break upon our shores in the never-be
ginning, never-ending anthem of thÂ« sea.
As fou travel over our valleys,. plains and
mountains your cheeks will be fanned, your
nostrils graced and your hearts warmed by the
Bephyrs. scents and sunshine of a demesne la
den with the fruits and garnished by the flow
ers of earth's choicest giving. You will stand
in ewe before those subiime works of nature
that fe.ru the heavens or cast their eternal
Ehadows over the silent canyons. In city. State
and elope, from the queenly Tamalpals and
Twin Peaks that guard the Golden Gate to the
pnotr-capped Hood, standing sentinel on our
Northwest frontier, lies an American common
wealth, proud and potential ânature's noblest
gift to the indissoluble family of States.. Here
it lies before you. fit and awaiting to be mold
ed to the highest ambitions of man and the
greatest glory of God.
Friends, we ask you in all gravity, "Whafc
t-hall we do with it?" That which we have

Valuable Find of Ambergris.

a valuable find of ambergris has been
made at Concepclon. W. F. Walraven, a
bridge carpenter, who has been at work
on the Southern Pacific bridges along the
coast line, came to town yesterday with
some specimens of a whitish, oily mass,
which he took to local chemists to ascer
tain what it was. They all pronounced it
to be a fine quality of ambergris. This
confirmed the belief of Walraven, who
has sent a specimen of the substance to
San Francisco to undergo a test by
chemical analysis. Should the test prove
its genuineness, the value of the find made
will probably exceed $5000.

willing to sell, and that the land in ques
tion is necessary for the carrying out of
tho plans of the Government. The sum
of $16,800 is named as a fair price for the
land wanted.

SPOKANE, July 17.â Judge James C.
Brady of Kooteiiai County, Idaho, died
from the effects of an assassin's bullet at a
local hospital at 6 o'clock this morning.
His body was hardly cold in death before
his two children had been abducted and
were being hurried East on a Northern
Pacific train by their uncle, Frank Pine
of Keswick, Iowa. Father Purcell, a
Catholic priest and friend of the Judge,
whom the latter with his dying breath
had made guardian of the children, swore
out a warrant. The train was stopped at
Sand Point, Idaho, and the uncle and chil
dren were taken into custody by the con
stable. Idaho courts will be appealed to
to decide which shall be guardian of the
children. Tho decision will determine also
whether the orphans shall be brought up
in the Catholic or Methodist faith.
Judge Brady while In his office in
Rathdrum. Idaho, on the night of July 5
was shot by Henry Wilmbusse. "Wilm
busse is a German whom the Judge -had
committed to an insane asylum and who
escaped. He llred once, the bullet pene
trating under the Judge's right eye and
fracturing the skull at the base of the
brain. Wilmbusse fled, but was captured
in this city a few days ago by a police
man after a flght. , Two loaded revolvers
were found. on the prisoner. ,
Judge Brady was formerly a -Catholic..
He married a Methodist lady, who died
here two years ago.. Â»The children are a
girl aged 7 and a boy aged 5. After the
Judge was wounded and was dying he
went back to the Catholic faith. Despite
the objections of their uncle the Judge
had the children brought to his deathbed
and baptized by Father Purcell. Then he
commended the children to the priests
care, nominated another friend to be ex
ecutor of his estate and passed away. _
The grandfather and the priest started
to-day on the east-bound train for the
family home at Rathdrum with the chil
dren. The uncle accompanied them. He
took possession of the little ones when the
others alighted at the station and contin
ued the journey. The swearing out of a
complaint and wiring ahead for the arrest
quickly followed. â, \
Mr. P<ne prvs that when Mrs. Brady lay
dying the Judge, her husband, promised
tnat ihe two criildren should be reared in
the Methodist faith. He contends that
under this promise he was justified in at
tempting to carry out his dead sister s
wish with respect to her babies, even if it
were necessary to abduct them.
Judge Brady was one of the prominent
Democrats of Idaho, ofÂ«which State he
had been a resident thirteen years. He
was serving a second term as Probate
judge and was editor and owner of the
Silver Blade, the official paper of Koote
nai County.

FEARFUL EXPLOSION
OF MILITARY BALLOON
The few prisoners who were taken were
executed on board the warship the fol
lowing morning. They were lined up in
a row and decapitated.
Two of the junks attempted to rescue
the leader of the pirates, who had been
thrown overboard, but was uninjured. No
sooner was he on deck than the two
junks were locked together with grap
pling irons and anchors and a last stand
was made there. Two boats' crews from
the warship came up and with their
rifles and a machine gun stripped the
decks of every living man. Then, Junk
by junk, the warship's men boarded the
craft and put to death with their swords
and revolvers those who still remained
alive. By 10 o'clock in the morning the
warship sailed away with not a single
living man left behind and only the
burning wrecks of the fast-sailing boats
of the pirates marked the scene of the
battle. â¢
The Chintai came up with the main
body of junks at 4 o'clock in the morn
ing, and, as the haze disappeared, the
'Junks tried to make sail and scatter out
in flight. The warship was in such a po
sition that she could use her heavy
broadside guns and the artillery that
points directly over her bow. One by one
the junks were dismasted, and the shrieks
of wounded and dying men mingled with
the roar of the guns. Three junks were
sunk almost with the first shots, and the
bodies of dozen of the pirates who had
jumped overboard in a vain endeavor to
escape death dotted the sea. Solid shot
ripped the junks from end to end, and
assisted in the annihilation of the crews.
The decks were slippery with blood even
before boarding parties were sent out
from the warship to complete the work.
VANCOUVER. B. C, July 17.â Sixteen
pirate Junks, returning from a buccaneer-
Ing expedition in a thickly populated set
tlement on the coast just north of Shang
hai, were rammed or blown up by the
Chinese man-of-war Chintai .three weeks
ago. News of the big sea flght was
brought to-day by the Empress of India,
whose passengers say it was the bloodiest
punishment that has been meted to the
pirates during recent years.
. The Chlntal had -been chasing the pi
rates for two days. She could easily have
come up with tiiem at any time, but
waited for the favorable opportunity that
came early on the morning ol June 28.
One fleet of ten junks parted company
witn the others -during the night, but it,
too, was being chased at last account,
and Its destruction seemed certain.

PITTSBURG, July 17.â "Wo have
not heard from the other side at
any time, in any way or on any
subject since we parted at the
Lincoln Hotel last Saturday."
This positive statement, made by Presi
dent Shaffer of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation this afternoon, disposes of the ru
mor from New York to-day that the strike
had been settled. Shaffer stated further
that no actual negotiations were on be
tween President Bishop of the Ohio State
Arbitration Board and himself tendlns
toward arbitration. A letter received by
Shaffer from Bishop, asking if he would
consent to the reopening of the confer
ence, has not been answered yet.
The principal events in the day's his
tory were the failure of the sheet steel
people to reopen the Wellsville plant with
non-union men; the offer of the financial
assistance made to the Amalgamated As
sociation by the two million members of
the American Federation of Labor, and
by the American Window Glass Workers
Association; the determination of the as
sociation to organize the immense steel
plant at Vandergrift, and the fact that
6everal of the closed plants are being pa
trolled by armed watchmen and guards.
Amalgamated Men Satisfied.
The Amalgamated officials to-night pro
less great satisfaction, over the results
accomplished since the strike, but officials
of the companies, as heretofore, will say
nothing 1 . ...Â»
The man upon the companies side who
had said anything up to date is Persifer
F. Smith, manager of the Sheet Steel
Company. The fight that he has on at
WellsviUe Is followed ciosely by the work
men, and to-morrow an open public meet-
Ing will be held at Wellsville. when Presi
dent Shaffer in person will present the
strikers' side of the case and endeavor to
overcome the effects of alleged misstate
ments concerning the late conference.

CHICAGO, July 17.â Unionism In the po
lice department and remote possibility of
a strike. Such are the latest develop
ments In the organization of wage earn
ers. Under the rhme of the Policemen's
Protective Association, an organization
perfected in a perfunctory manner last
April has developed into what is now rec
ognized in police circles as a typical union.
A membership of 1700 is said to have been
attained, and. confident in its strength, all
secrecy as to its alms and purposes is to
be thrown aside Sunday, when a big meet
ing is to be held and 100 new members
initiated.
Following the announcement of the
Mayor's policy to reduce salaries or com
pel involuntary "vacations" to meet the
deficiencies In the city exchequer, the po
lice department was disturbed to-day by
allusions to the possibility of a strike be
ing ordered. While there is nothing: in
the constitution to warrant such a. course,
it would be, Â¦within the power of the rrpm
bers to decide upon a strike by ballot.

SALINAS, July 17. â Scores of men and
boys fought for hours to-day to stay the
ravages of a series of grain fires, the ori
gin of â¢which has not been determined. By
their valiant efforts the several conflagra
tions were confined to small areas and the
valley saved from tremendous loss. At 2
o'clock this afternoon a message by tele
phone from Riverside, near the Spreckels
sugar factory, reported the gralnflelds
afire and asked that an engine and men
be sent. When aid arrived a field of 250
acres of barley belonging to L. B. Hig
gins was found 'n flames. It 'was claimed
two Chinese had driven along the county
road and after having lighted cigarettes
deliberately threw several burning
matches Into the field of standing grain.
Two hundred men were soon fighting the
fire, aided by several water wagons. After
a hard struggle they succeeded in check
ing the names. Higglns' loss is about $3000,
covered by insurance.
CHICAGO POLICEMEN
MAY GO ON A STRIKE
Hardly had the fire-fighters rested be
fore another alarm was received from a
field two miles distant and in close prox
imity to the sugar factory at Spreckels.
This fire was on the ranch of James
Thompson, and .. is said to have been
caused by sparks from a locomotive. The
entire force from the factory, aided by
the gang from the first fire, fought for
nearly three hours to subdue the flames,
which destroyed four immense stacks, the
product of 250 acres of barley ready for
threshing.
A third firÂ© was reported late to-night
about three miles from the scene of the
last one.

"Manager Smith has been invited to at
tend the meeting and make a statement
for the Sheet Company.
"While Wellsville is the present strike
center now, the battle ground will be
shifted to McKeesport next week if- the
report be true that the W. Dewees wood
plant of the American Sheet Steel Com
pany will resume operations.- This would
afford one of the most trying situations
of the strike. It would necessitate the
importation of non-union men from other
places, and the bitter feeling engendered
by such a movement would be hard to
control.
The report from Wellsville, Ohio, to
night says:
Boys Doing Men's Work.
"The attempt to start the "Wellsville
plant of the American Sheet Steel Com
pany this morning resulted in a partial
success. As a result one mill was in op
eration to-day with a complete force.
Boys are doing men's work and receiving
men's pay. Helpers are taking the places
of skilled workers and confusion reigns.
Although steam, is issuing from every
smokestack and the management says
three mills are working, millmen laugh
at their claim and say that there are not
men enough inside the plant to operatfe
one mill pronerly."
At Monessen, Pa., about 500 men of the
steel hoop mill are out. Much pressure is
being brought to bear on the 800 men of
the tin plate workers, and it is now con
sidered more than probable that they will
refuse to quit. Notices were to-day post
ed In the tin mill granting a voluntary
advance of 10 per cent to heaters and
catchers and 8 per cent to the rollers.
Percy E. Donner, superintendent of the
tin mill, said to-day:
"As far as I have been able to ascertain,
after a close investigation, only four or
five men talk of quitting:."
â¢The Monessen tin mill has a greater
output than any other mill In the combine
and all efforts will be made to keep it
running-. Repeated efforts to organize the
men in the tin mill have proved futile.

Or THE FOURTH I>AY
Tho big men of the fourth day's shoot
ing were Dr. F. Schumacher of the San

Glindemann of the San Francisco Schuet
zen Verein. Schumacher earned his laurels
on the Eureka, the honorary target, and
is up to date the high man for special
prize, winnings. His three shots were made
on the Eureka and they added up just
70 points. On his first shot Dr. Schu
macher made 24 points. Then he repeated
this performance, something far out of
the ordinary. His third shot was 22. â¢
Altogether there were fifty-one shooters
on the honorary range. Max Schmidt of
the San Jose Rifle Club made 65. the next
highest score for the day. M. Reubold of
San Francisco made 64, and Jacob Grueh
lcr of Sacramento made the same score.
F. W. Belknap of Los Angeles made 63. W.
C." Morken and Antone- Lemalre of San'

ADOLPH STRECKER, THE ,
MAN FOR THE KINGSHIP
The sapient are beginning to sift the
shooters and select the king for this fes
tival. Four men seem to stand on a pre
eminent step 'n the contest. They are
M. C. Ramsey of Grand Junction, Colo.;
Adolph Strecker of the California
Schuetzen, D. W. McLaughlin of the Gold
tn Gate Rifle and Pistol Club and Fred
Schuester of the Germania Schuetzen.
These men are shooting like demons, pick
ing off points that startle the markers and
scorers. "Look out for Strecker," is the
cry. There is a substantial foundation for
it, too, for Strecker is outdoing his own
remarkable records hour after hour. This
kingship will not be settled for some days,
and it keeps all in a conjectural, nervous
boll all the time. Â¦ .

POPUIiAB MERCHANTS
FAIL TO HIT TARGET
OnÂ© of 'the amusing: features of "all
people's day" was the contest between
Pete WenJger and Louis Schlatter. Both
of these gentlemen eater to the tastes of
the eating: and drinkinff public. They be
came Imbued with the idea that they
were Intended for greater things than
catering to the wants of the "Inner man"
and spoke loudly of their skill with the
gun. Each one had probably used a rifle
before starting for Shell Mound, but thejr
scores were not of the kind that made
any great impression on those who know
What a good score is.
They shot for points and out of a pos
sible thirty in ten shots Schlatter madÂ©
ono. "Wenlger used up ten shots and did
not even see the flajr which tolls the
shooter that the target had been hit. At
the close of the contest Schlatter ' and
Wenlger were informed by an unfeeling
scorer that they would make good "farm
ers" as they had plow6d up more ground
than all the participants In the festival.
Emll Berckman of Hoboken. New Jer
sey, was one of the steady shooters of
the day.
PLUCKY MBS. ECAN1TEL
SCARES CRACK SHOTS
The marksmen at Shell Mound I*ark
yeaterdav were greatly surprised when
Mrs. O. F. Mannel stepped up to the en
trance of the class case facing the hon
orary target and presented a ticket enti
tling her to a try for one of the big
prizes. She .Jjot her "try." and Incident
ally made some of the crack, shots feel
rather small. When she relinquished her
gun she had 44 scored opposite her name,
and left the booth with the knowledge
that many of the men who tried for hon
ors would not get as many points.
Mrs. Mannel was nervous, otherwise she
would have made a higher score. To shoot
in the presence of so many men who had
national reputations as sharpshooters was
a little too much for the brave little wom
an, and she failed to come as close to a
dead center as she might. She succeeded
however, in frightening the "cracks."'
More than one expert rifleman' was heard
to remark that "Mrs. Mannel would make
them hustle to hold a place in the first
ranks if allowed to shoot under more fa
vorable circumstances."
Mrs. Mannel is the wife of Q. p Man
nel. president of the Columbia Pistol and
Rifle Club, and enjoys the distinction of
being the. champion woman revolver shot
of the coast. V

ADVERTISEMENTS. . : .
Do you have a feeling of undue fullness
in the stomach, belchings, or sour or
bitter risings? These are but a few of
the symptoms of the diseased stomach.
The worst thing which can be done
for the stomach in such a case is to take
some tablet or powder which merely
gives temporary relief from discomfort.
The best thing to do Is to begin the cure
of the disease by beginning the use of
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical. Discovery.
It cures diseases of the stomachy and
other organs of digestion and nutrition.
It makes the "weak* stomach strong,
and puts the body in a condition of
vigorous health. â¢
"I was troubled a long time -with dyspepsia,
torpid liver, and constipation," writes Mrs. Julia
E. Deal, ot Ostwalt, Iredell Ca, N. C. "Could
scarcely eat anything at all : would have attacks
of pain something like cohc, and sometimes it
seemed as though I could not live. I wrote to
Dr. R. V, Pierce, stating my condition, and in a
few days received a kind letter of advice, telling
me to use Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov-
ery. I took four bottles, and one vial of Dr.
Pierce's Pellets, and now I can eat anything I
. want and it doa't hurt me. I have not been in
bed a day since I took- your 'Goldea Medical

toms of disease. I have not talcen any medicine

the swFr^sraaHCjco.. Atlanta, qa. j^â¢â^^The manner in which corn has held its
own during the drought was something re
markable, and is a source of wonder to
the' farmers;" In some places It has, had
no moisture for over two months. It has
made almost no growth, but the leaves
have been kept green and the tassel kept
off. Weeds coula not flourish in the dry
spell any more than the corn, and they
were easily eradicated. The fields are
therefore clean and have taken a new
lease of life since the rain. "With a large
wheat crop and the present" fair prospects
for corn.' drought suffering in Kansas will
be reduced to a minimum.
Good rains are reported to-night ever
portions of Eastern and Central Kansas,
and in each cage is mentioned the fact
that the rain i;Tnot ended. Emporla, Clay
Center, Ellsworth, Balina, Atcnison, fcjyi
vian Grove.: Great Bend, Concordia,
Quenemo, Ottawa, Fredonia and Osage
City are among the places favored with
rains, which ranged from one and a half
to two inches. .
Secretary Coburn.of the Kansas Board
of Agriculture ls .enthusiastic over the
result 'of the rain. Coburn has been
optimistic all along as to the ultimate out
come of the drought, saying there was not
the least cause for alarm, as Kansas could
well taue care of herself. He Is sure that
the corn yield will reach at least half a
crop If the present very favorable weather
conditions continue.
The drought In Kansas has been broken
and with it has gone the excessive heat
spell. It is the opinion among those who
have been watching the weather con
ditions that the season will be more fa
vorable to crops from now on.
TOPEKA, Kan., July 11.â Rains that
have fallen In Kansas last night and to
day have. practically assured a corn yield
of at least 50,000,000 bushels, and the yield
may be even greater. The State is under
the influence of a low barometric con
dition and more rain is expected to-night.
Correspondents from numerous Kansas
towns, in reporting rains, say that the
sky is overcast with clouds, to-night and
that more rain within a few hours is cer
tain. - *

JJL Episcopal Church took place yes
terday afternoon and was attend
ed by all the people that could be crowd
ed into the lower rooms of the beautiful
edifice. .Owing to the non-arrival of trains
Bishop J. \V. Joyce, D. D-, president of
the league, did not arrive to participate
in the exercises, but Bishop Hamilton,
who presided, extemporized a programme
that pleased everybody, and raised $100
for the ladles besides.
The home is a handsome concrete build
ing on the mission style, located at 912
Washington street. It contains twenty
two rooms on the two floors and base
ment. It was constructed at a cost of
$7000, which was contributed by Interested
parties and church organizations.
The work here had a very small begin
ning as will be seen from the following
historical facts: \
In August, 1870. the superintendent of the Chi
nese mission. Rev. Otis Gibson, called a meet
ing of Christian women to plan lot-active work.
Eleven answered the call. "The Woman's Mis-
Eionary Society of the Pacific Coast" was then
organized and a constitution framed.
In 1872 the Woman's Missionary Society of the
Pacific Coast applied to the General Missionary
Society and proposed to become auxiliary to
that society.' The proposition was accepted,
and thereafter the General Missionary Society
appropriated funds for the work, and what
was raised by the Woman's Missionary Society
of the Pacific Coast, if not needed ln the work,
was sent to the treasurer of the General Mis
sionary Society ln New York.
At the annual meeting of the W. H. M. so
ciety, held in October, 1893. at Toledo, Ohio.
Mrs. Williams was a delegate, and 60 pre
sented the work a,mong the Chinese and Japa
nese women on the Pacific Coast that the so
ciety realized as never before that it was the
legitimate work of W. H. M. Society. They
adopted It, making It a bureau of the same
and electing Mrs. Williams as secretary, since
which time the General Missionary Society has
been relieved of the burden and the women of
Methodism have accepted the responsibility.
First Woman to Be Rescued.
In October. 1S71, more than a year after the
organization of the society, the, first woman
came. She was rescued from the bay, where
phe had attempted suicide. Her name was Jim
Ho. She soon began work In a Christian fam
ily and ln two vears married a Christian Chi
nese. She died in 1880. In 1873 a school was
opened with Miss L. S. Te^mpleton as teacher.
For the past four years the home has been
under the management of Mrs. Kate Lake as
matron and assisted by her daughter,. Miss
Marguerite Lake, who ls doing brave and tire
less work in striving to rescue girls from dens
of infamy and lead them into paths of truth
and usefulness. The average number in the home
is about twenty. At present there is a larger
number of small children than ever at one time
before. Nine are under twelve years of age.
The expense ls |60 per year for residents and
530 for day pupils. A number are supported by
individuals and societies. In all about 500
women and girls have been helped ln one way
or another.
Rev. J. D. Hammond read the Scripture
and Rev. John Kirby. D. D., offered the
dedicatory prayer. Rev. M. C. Harris
read an original poem, written by
Mrs. Harris, which was heartily re
ceived. Rev. Mr. Gardner followed at
length, giving the inside history of the
ladies' work and commending them for
their faithfulness. Rev. Mr. Smyth,
president of the university at Fooehow,
Fukien province, China, told of home life
in that country and expressed his gratifi
cation at the place offered the slaves in
this land. Two little Chinese girls added
Interest to the occasion by singing a song
In English.
Ho Yow Delivers Address.
His Excellency, the Imperial Consul
General to the United States, Ho Yow,
who had been an interested listener, was
then introduced. "This work ought to
have the indorsement," he declared," of
every right-thinking person, whether
black, white, brown or yellow. I am glad
to see the ways and means provided for
the rescue of the slave girls. The lawa
of China favor the rescue work. Its non
enforcement is the fault of the petty offi
cials. The enticing of jrlrls from home
for Buch purposes ls punishable by decap-
Vissengers had. A few of them dropped
t>art of their coin in the bottom of the
stage and afterward recovered it. One of
them had $240 in a purse, which he quietly
deposited on the^ top of the stage. An
other dropped $200 in the road and shoved
â¢the. dust over it with his foot. He after
ward returned and found It. A third, not
fo fortunate, pitched a half-dollar to the
robber, declaring that was all he had,
but the closer proximity of the rifle soon
.brought several $5 pieces. The ladles
were treated with all courtesy and were
Â¦not much frightened.
: Sheriff Smith and his deputies have
been searching the country in all direc
'tior.s from the spot and several deputies
sre still out, but they work under disad
vantages, as the description of the rob
ber is uncertain. The drivers say he was
about five feet ten inches tall, wore a
dark sack coat and overalls and a black
slouch hat. There -was a white cloth mask
over his face and he had long dark whis
kers, which were probably false.
By the time this stage was properly at

The robber was lirst seen by Raymond
Hill, who was driving- the nrst stage. He
was on the bank above the road -with the
muzzle of a Winchester rifle pointed at
the driver. When the body of the stage
was Just in front and beneath him he
said. "Stop." He then ordered the male
passengers to get out. line up and pitch
their money up to him on the bank. The
ladies were told to stand up In the stage.
The passengers at first believed it was a
â¢Â¦Josh," but were sternly ordered to hurry.
Bu-.it Bucknell and Raymond Hill, the
orivers of the two stages, returned tto
I'kiah to-day. They confirm the report
telegraphed to The Call last night that
a single man did the work, and did it
with marked success. The point selected
ljy the robber was eminently fitted" for a
hold-up, it being a narrow place in the
canyon of a branch of Russian River and
on an uphill grade.
The V.'illits and Blue Lakes roads sep
arate about four miles above Ukiah, and
it' any one left I'kiah ahead of the stages
he could easily have committed the rob
bery and then cut across country to Cal
pella. on the "Willits road. Shannon is
beins held for lurthor investigation.
t'KIAH, July 17.â Under Sheriff Thomas
to-day arrested a man who is suspected
oÂ£ having robbed the two stages on -the
Blue Lakes road j-esterday. He gives the
name of Peter W. Shannon. The suspect
came to Ukiah yesterday forenoon on a
bicycle. He stopped at the Donahue
Jiouse. where he said he was on his way
to Eureka. At 2 o'clock ln the afternoon
he started on his wheel on the same road
by which the stapes left town. He said
to-day that he went straight to W'lllits,
remaining there last night. At 9:30 o'clock
this morning he pedaled Into Uklah.
Some boys who -were fishing yesterday
near where the hold-up took place recog
nized him as the man they saw in the
near vicinity about the time of the rob
bery. Shannon Is reticent and answers
questions with apparent reluctance. He
(says he came to California from Mon
tana in May; that he has done no work
pir.ee his arrival, but makes a living by
â¢"beating-" nlckel-in-the-slot machines,
lie says he has a. system by which he can
"jeat" any "square" machine. He had
mere than $30 in his pocKets, and a card
showing that he Is a member of the Cal
ifornia Cycling Association. He wears
blue striped overalls and a dark coat and
carries no baggage.

OUT of the scandals of the suit brought against
Howard Gould by his former valet, F. D.
Mowbray, there is a possibility that after all
some good may come by the establishment of a
precedent which will protect witnesses against the ag
gressions of unscrupulous attorneys. It will be re
membered that. ( in-the course of the trial when Gould
was on the stand the attorney for Mowbray conducted
the cross-examination into Gould's private life, evi
dently seeking' by various means to make the witness
odious in the minds of the jury. A verdict was given
for Mowbray, but an appeal was^taken, and the
Appellate Court has just reversed the action of the
lower court.
It appears from the reports that the action of the
Appellate Court was largely determined by what the
Justices regarded as an undue license given to the at
torneys for Mowbray in cross-examining the ' de
fendant. The Justice who delivered the opinion is
quoted as saying: "It cannot be that because a party
refuses to submit to a demand made upon him, and
himself goes upon the witness-stand to contradict tes
timony given by. an adversary, he can by reason of
that fact.be compelled to divulge the secrets of his life,
unless such secrets are connected with or have some
bearing upon the matter being tried. A party, when
he becomes a witness, is entitled even on cross
examination to be protected. Witnesses have some
rights which courts are bound to respect. Attacks
of the kind set out in this record cannot be made upon
one's private life under the guise of cross-examina
tion. Their purpose is either to coerce the party into
a settlement or else to unduly and unjustly prejudice
the jury against him. Such examinations tend, to
bring the administration of the law and a trial of ac
tion into disrepute and to lessen the respect which
litigants have for the courts."
It is gratifying that to the decision thus given there
was no dissent. It is certainly good morals and good
sense as well as good law. The extent to which wit
nesses are abused- by lawyers of a certain. type has
long constituted one of the most -serious reproaches
against our. system of conducting trials. It, has at
times- seemed as if the bar. and the bench regarded
witnesses as persons having no rights that courts are
bound to respect. The New York decision, if it be
followed elsewhere, will tend to good in many ways,
not the least of which will be a better service rendered
to the cause of justice by "eliminating from trials a
great deal of evidence that is irrelevant and designed
only to prejudice juries and thus unfit them for
rightly performing their duty.

Jumbo, a Barnum pet of the African persuasion, has been
exploited as the "biggest ever." But, in animal parlance, ho
had "more daylight under him." This extreme length of leg
and an unprepossessing hump on Jumbo's back pushed his
height to a sensational point, though he weighed a ton and a
half less than* Bolivar does. At the time of the latter's acqui
sition he weighed 8700 pounds. Now it has Increased to 12,000.
He Is ten feet high, or four inches better than twelve years
ago, and two inches higher than any Indian elephant ever seen
by Savealson, the. great traveler and elephant authority.
In the dietary way he is a wonder. Hay and potatoes dis
appear as If by magic. Of the former he eats 150 pounds each
day.
Adam Forepaugh gave Bolivar to the zoo as a Christmas
present in 1888. He enjoined them to handle him carefully.
"That's the finest beast I ever owned, and he won't do any
harm If he don't get away. But, mind you, that you keep him
fast," said Forepaugh, who had obtained him at the age of 10.
He-^is now 40, and there seems no reason why he should not
live 100 years longer. A native of Ceylon, he ia both the largest
and most perfect type of Indian elephant ever seen in this
country. In fact, his great size was the chief reason that Fore
paugh let him go. It had become extremely dangerous to carry
him about on trainboard. His back persisted in pushing up
until the top of hlg car could not clear the overhead structures
along the railroad, and once this caused a wreck up In Central
New Tork. He was too big a proposition for "Ady."
chains must suffice. As Bolivar is always in motion there can
be no fear of his blood becoming sluggish through Inaction.
There Is no yard for him. though his campanlon la allowed one.
for his strength and weight and wicked tendencies would be
come assertive, and there is a moral responsibility In keeping
him incapable of harm. It might make a good story If he got
on the rampage, but the zoo would need repopulatlon.
BOLIVAR, the pride of the Philadelphia Zoological Gar
den, and probably the largest elephant In captivity, has
been chained, standing In one place, for nearly thirteen
years, says the Philadelphia Times. Day and night,
season in and out, his ponderous bulk has kept up its
ceaseless swing and rock from side to side in this one corner
Â¦within an area circumscribed by the detaining power of three
chains. Circuses come and go and elephants galore stop within
the sound of his trumpeting blasts, but he never seems to
care: only keeps his corner, apparently well contented.
Each year Bolivar seeks to create a sensation. Never of an
amiable temper, the first of the summer months usually finds
him contracting ugly moods. Then he wants to fight. His food
does not suit, noise irritates him and incidents generally viewed
complacently throw him into a towering rage. There Is trouble
brewing If Keeper George Harrison does not look out. It Is
impotent rage, though, for it only brings to his elephantship
another chain, which is attached to the free leg. Then all are
drawn fairly tight, and Bolivar is left to sulk and grumble and
sway harder than ever until hl3 saccharine qualities show
again. It is about time now for his annual tantrums.
"Does it not injure him to stand so long in one place?" was
asked of Superintendent Brown. He says it does not, and he
has, with the air of anatomical charts, proved to various In
quiring agents of the Society for the Prevention of Cruetty to
Animals, that Bolivar is not cruelly treated. In most animals
the bones of the leg do not set directly above one another, but
are placed at such angles that a constant strain on the muscles
Is necessary in standing 1 . With the elephant the formation is
different. The bones are set squarely together, with broad,
bearing joints and directly vertical to each other. Thus a solid
column or four solid columns support the body, and the muscles
are hardly necessary at all In standing.
For exercise the swaying and short stepping allowed by the

A NEW VIEW OP FRANCE.
SO much has been written of late about the sta
tionary condition of the population of France
and the assumed decadence of the virility of the
people, it is interesting to note that another view of
the subject has been taken by recent students of the
matter. It is not denied that the population is sta
tionary, nor that in such respect France stands alone
among the great nations of Europe. It is claimed,
however, that the small birth rate is due mainly to the
land system of the country, which makes almost every
French peasant a land owner, and therefore is not to
be looked upon as a sign of racial decadence or, even
of a bad sociological condition.
There are no other people of the world, not even
those of the United States, among whom there is so
large a proportion of landowners as among the French,
nor are there any people as a whole who are more
prosperous. The law, however, requires the land to be
divided among the children of the proprietor at his
death, and the effect has been to limit the size of fam
ilies. That much has been long known and often com
mented upon, but now it is to be noted that in dwell
ing upon the evil of small families, most students of
French affairs have overlooked the good that results.
One writer says: "It is true that a stationary popu
lation does not furnish as many conscripts, as many
emigrants, and, in France, not as many seekers for
employment in the industries of the cities. On the
other hand, where the great body of the population is
agricultural, the average standard of living and com
fort is kept higher. There is less extreme poverty. If
the army is not so numerous, that is not an unmixed
evil, for it is probably ample for defense, and is less of
a temptation to aggression. If colonists are fewer,
foreign trade is not on that account necessarily less
profitable. If labor tends to greater cost in wages, it
also tends to greater capacity, and in modern condi
tions it is skill and the use of machinery, not wages,
that determine the cost per unit which tells in com
petition." '
Another writer says: "France has the most sub
stantial civilization in Europe. Her condition is the
ideal one of social philosophers, for she has a greater
proportion of independent land holders than any other
country. Her sturdy yeomanry are the envy of Eu-.
rope, and the guaranty of national stability."
There is no reason to doubt that these views are.
well justified. There may be evidences of decadence
and degeneracy among the absinthe drinkers of Paris,
but there are none among the thrifty land owners of
the country. 'France is all right.
London financiers are expressing the deepest con
sternation at the fact, that we are selling England
too much and reaping a harvest of too much British
gold. It is timely to note that they do not complain
that they are not getting value received.
Chief Secretary to enforce the crimes act, With per
fect frankness he explained why he Issued that invi
tation,' Â¦: *I hate your rule iff Ireland, and it is the great
ambition of my life to destroy it. You are able to
preserve the pretense of constitutional government,
but as one who hates your rule I would like to see
this mask torn from your faces.' "
After that speech it will be seen that Rosebery's
emission of Irish questions from the crisis he was
considering'shows that he is! not much stronger than
the leaders he was criticizing. Evidently he had no
counsel to offer on that subject any more than on
anything cise, and yet this is surely a good time for
the British Government . to take some steps toward
doing justice te the Ir-ish people. As the London
Chrenicie itself says: f 'A time when Ireland may
fairly be described as erimeicss is one which should
be seized as an opportunity by a far-sighted Govern
ment. For large constitutional charfge the occasion
is not now, nor is the attitude of the Irish on the war
likeiy to hasten it. But now is the time when efforts
should be made to govern Ireland somewhat more in
accordance with Irish ideas."
The integrity of life still depends upon the obser
vance of restraints and limits that seem to be neces
sary to the well-being of man, no matter what the
social system or his place therein.
We hope that Mr. Wilson will not handicap his cult
by viewing marriage loosely, or attempting to cancel
the line which divides honesty from dishonesty, and
morality from immorality.
The evidence appears to be on the side of the
declaration that if the- conditions for which Herron
and Wilson declaim had existed and been maintained
among men to this day we would have neither science,
nor art, nor civilization. If this be so, to introduce
those conditions now may mean the loss of science,
art and civilization by processes as gradual as those
by which these have been gained by man.
Would a government have invented and perfected
the steam-engine? Would it have invented the tele
graph and telephone, the turbine wheel, electric light
and the appliances of electric power?
Governments do not invent nor improve anything.
Government cannot even defend itself without the
help of the individual who, under the much abused
competitive system, has felt moved and spurred on
by the- necessity that he excel in order that he may
live better and in more agreeable circumstances.
With all the resources of the universe in, public
ownership, what stimulus would there have been ; to
the ambition and the inventive genius of man?
We suppose that theologians will never agree upon
what Christianity is. The simple view of it as a life
to be lived, and not a dogma to crack heads and cut
throats about, is not generally accepted, perhaps be
'cause it is simple. But one is at a loss to find in what
little the New Testament teaches any authority for
denouncing private ownership of property as sinful
and anti-Christian. The brief passage which de
scribes the forlorn fraternity of the Disciples and ac
cents their trials by saying that "they had all things
in common" cannot be taken as authority for the
overthrow of an industrial system that has developed
out of the frictions, the ambitions and the energies of
man. The competitive system is as old as the first
ambition to be better than his fellows that stirred one
man to work more cr do better work in order that
he might have more and live better. No one has yet
shown how the civilization we have could have grown
on the foundation advocated by Herron and Wilson.
The eclipse of Rev. Mr. Herron is followed by the
rise of a successor in the person of the Rev. J. S.
Wilson, who hails from Evanston, 111., and is now on
a tour in California. He preached in Los Angeles
last Sunday and made an attack upon existing in
dustrial conditions that is described 'as "scathing."
These reformers all "scathe" when they* get in ac
tion. In his view the competitive system is opp'osed
to Christianity, and should be put down. He is not
only alarmed, but incensed, because "the present sys
tem is a gigantic struggle for existence. The re
sources of the universe are subject to private Owner
ship, and while such ia the case there can be no true
Christianity." s
lator of morality.
REV. GEORGE D. HERRON had a meteoric
career as. an endowed and grubstaked teacher
of what he called "Christian socialism," and
ended the same by desertion of his wife, a divorce
and partnership with the rich daughter of his rich
patroness through a sort of jump-the-broomstick
marriage. He began with an attack on the industrial
system of the world because of its competitive fea
ture, and ended with an attack on clean and decent
marriage. We by no means say that his social doc
trines gain or lose bj' his loose morality and light
view of the marriage tie, but it has come to be a
common thing that many who rave against social con
ditions are found to be at war with common honesty
or common decency. Nearly every anarchist assas
sin has been found to be a thief or a notorious vio-
HERROITS SUCCESSOR.
The local committee chosen to provide the recep

LAND LAWS FOR IRELAND.
The salient feature of the debate was the^emark
ible speech of Mr. Redmond in reply to the Chief
Secretary. The London Chronicle â¢ in reporting it
says: "He began by referring to /the criminal stat
istics, which show that there have been no cases of
homicide inlreland during the last year. " He claimed
that that record has no rival, and he asserted that the
great national associations -like â¢ " the United Irish
League are the cause of this unique immunity from
crime. He disclosed some 'of the ludicrous ways in
which the , Irish Government tries Â¦ to suppress free
speech, and he wound up with. an', invitation to the
from the speech that the Government has troubles
enough or. its hands and does not intend to stir up
another hornet's nest in Ireland either by bringing in
a land purchase bill or by trying to suppress the
During the same debate another interesting phase
of the Irish question came under review. Some of
the Ulster Tories, called upon the Government to sup
press the United Irish League. ' To that request the
Chief Secretary replied that the league is not offen
sive. He went on to say that the number of agrarian
outrages in Ireland is lower this year than ever be
fore since the. crimes act was withdrawn. It is clear
The omission is the more curious because Parlia
ment has recently been engaged in a very warm de
bate on Irish affairs. It will be remembered that at
the opening of Parliament there was promise in the
King's speech that the Ministry would introduce a
bill "providing for the purpose of regulating, the vol
untary sale by landlords to occupying tenants in Ire
land." That bill has not yet been introduced, but
when the subject was brought up for discussion" in
the Commons the Chief Secretary for Ireland said:
"The Government is as convinced as any member of
the House that a land bill for Ireland is a necessity."
It is with phrases of that kind the Government seeks
to postpone the issue. It declares the land law to be
a necessity, but it does not bring in a bill to provide
one!
LORD ROSEBERY in the manifesto he has just
issued to the Liberal party in Great Britain
pronounces a good deal of very just criticism
upon the divisions of the party, but does not offer any
counsel as to how to form a policy on- which they
can "unite for action. He says: ."It is a matter of
sorrow and anxiety to see a weak Government faced
by a weaker opposition at a juncture of foreign hos
tility and international competition which needs all
the vigilance and agility at our command." It will
be noted that in pointing out the factors that consti
tute the elements dangerous to the British empire in
the present crisis the former Prime Minister makes no
allusion to Ireland.
In the meantime, however, the advantages of rural
life are increasing. As farm holdings become smaller
the families are not so lonely as they have been in
times past, and, moreover, there are greater facilities
for getting to and from cities and for enjoying the
benefits of libraries and schools. In California, where
ten nrrrc of Innd well cultivated as an orchard, a vine
yar" â¢-- :i :r.arket garden, will yield enough to sup
port r fimily. there is no reason why the cities should
grow at the expense of the country. In 'this State,
therefore, the drift toward the cities is never likely
to reach the danger point, or even to reach that dis
proportion between urban and rural population that
now exists in some of the older States of the East
How long the drift of the population to the city
will continue and how far it will go are matters on
which there has been a good deal of ingenious specu
lation. Some writers have estimated that all of Eng
land and Scotland from London to Glasgow will in
the course of this century become virtually one huge
metropolis, and American cities are expected to ex
pand in proportion. â¢ The only limits that can be
placed upon the growth of cities are those imposed
by the difficulty of feeding large populations and the
difficulty of transporting people from their homes in
the suburbs to the business centers. Improving fa
cilities for the transportatior^pf food and of passen
gers are of course every year widening the limits im
posed by such difficulties. Steamships and railways
can carry food to New York or London for popula
tions far in excess of those now living in those cen
ters, while various kinds of street railways, under
ground and overhead, as well as on the surface, af
ford ample means for transporting the people from
one part of the city to another with ease and with
rapidity.
This movement toward the cities is not surprising.
It has long been noted in all civilized countries, and
the causes that determine it are well understood by
the general public. None the less it is regarded by
sociologists as an evil that should be counteracted
as far as possible. It is from the rural districts that
all nations draw their best manhood. That applies
not only to physical vigor but even to mental acute
ness, which might have been expected to be more
common among children raised in a city. The facts
show, however, that a majority of the men who make
their way to the front in any large city, either in this
country or in Europe, are from the country and had
their early training on a farm.
The greater portion of the urban population is in
the Northern and Eastern States. In Rhode Island
91.6 per cent of the people live in urban communities.
Next in order come Massachusetts, 85.g; New York,
71.2; New Jersey, 67.5; Connecticut, 65.5; Pennsyl
vania, 51.1; Illinois, 51.0; California, 48.9; Maryland,
48.2; New Hampshire, 46.7; Ohio, 44.8; Delaware,
41.4; Colorado, 41.2, and Michigan, 37.2.
When compared with the census of 1880 the drift of
population to the cities is shown in a striking man
ner. In that year only 25.8 per cent of the people
lived in towns of more than 4000 inhabitants, and
there were only 850 such communities in the coun
try. In 1890 the number had increased to 899, but in
1900 they numbered 1158. Moreover, in late years
the larger cities have grown in population even more
rapidly than the smaller ones, and in 1900 about one
half of the urban population was living in cities of
more than 100,000 people.
FROM a recently issued bulletin of the Census
Office concerning the urban population of the
United States it appears that at the time the
census was taken there were 28,411,698 people living
in towns or cities of more than 4000 population. That
amounted to 37.3 per cent of the whole number of
people in the country, being a gain of almost 5 per
cent since the census of 1890, when the percentage
was 32.9.

James J. Jeffries, heavy-weight cham
pion of the world, arrived In the city yes
terday from Catalina Island, with the> In
tention of remaining in this city for the
winter and partaking in a few exhibitions
In the pugilistic arena. :
Jeffries looks to be in the pink of con
dition and when seen last evening with
his manager, J. P. Egan, he expressed
himself as .being delighted to be in the
city of the Golden West again.
When asked as to the object of his visit
to this city, Jeffries said:
"I left the 'East about six weeks ago in
order to escape the hot spell. We came
right through to the coast and went to
Catalina Island. We had a great time and
enjoyed tuna fishing and goat hunting. I
propose to stay here for the winter and
make a few matches. I would like to meet
Fitzsimmons, from whom I won the cham
pionship of the world. Six* months after
I whipped him he claimed that he had
been 'doped' and that he was in no con
dition to fight me. Well, I will give him
the first chance. If Ruhlin or Sharkey
want to meet me I will take them on in
proper 'order. I have so far made no ar
rangements with any clubs, although I
have received proposition* from them.
"I expect to remain here for a week and
then I will go to the mountains to spend,
the balance of my vacation. I weigh at
the present time about 225 pounds, but I
hope to be able to fight at. 205 or 206
pounds. I shall do a certain amount of
exercise In order to keep myself in trim.
I need not say that I am delighted to get
back to this coast. Pugilistic affairs in
the East are in bad condition, due to the
faking managers and certain fighters."
J. P. Egan, manager for Jeffries, was
welcomed by a host of friends. The pop
ular manager of the champion of the ring
has changed but little since he was here
last. He also expressed his delight at be
ing in San Francisco and escaping- from
the heat of the | East. "When asked to
give his views on. pugilism in the East
Egan said: "It is as Jeffries says. Fake
fighters and fake promoters have spoiled
the game all over the country. The pub
lic is always willing and anxious to see
a genuine fight, but it is tired of the so
called fighters who lay down in the ring
In order to make money through the bet
ting books. Pugilism will always be pop
ular as long as It Is genuine. Jeffries will
be ready to meet Fitzsimmons, Ruhlln,
Sharkey or any of the others who feel
they have a right to contest 'Jim's' title
to the championship. As his manager I
shall exact the same conditions as were
exacted from him when he challenged
the holder of the championship."

ARRIVES HERE
The San Francisco Produce Exchange
held Its annual meeting yesterday morn-
Ing at 11 o'clock in its rooms in the Mer
chants' Exchange building. There was a
full attendance of members.
The annual reports of the president,
George W. McNear, and the treasurer,
Henry F. Allen, were received. The re
port bf the president was as follows:
To the Members of the San Francisco Prod
uce Exchange â Gentlemen: I have the honor to
submit my annual report of the affairs of your
exchange for the past year, the twenty-third
year of its corporate existence.
It is the closing period of three comparatively
dry seasons, during which there has been only
a moderate Â¦ production of the cereals most
traded in by your members. It has been a sea
son of low prices, void Of all speculative char
acter, and, consequently, not a season favor
able to general prosperity or to this exchange.
The new season commences with prospects of
a large harvest and good 'export demand for
our cereals. We have good reason to expect a
much larger business and to have results bene
ficial to the producers and to your exchange
association.
During the year it has been your misfortune
to lose by death four of jour membersâ W. H.
Yates. John F. English, J. Fairbanks and Wil
liam Presbach. W. II. Yates and William
Dresbach were charter members. There have
been thirteen new members admitted and a like
number were retired.
Good Financial Showing.
For the details of the financial conditions of
your Exchange and Call Board, I beg to refer
you to the reports of the secretary and treas
urer. From these reports you will see your
margin fund earned $4472 12 net. a very good
showing considering the reduced amount in the
fund resulting from the lack of speculative Call
Board contracts during the year.
Your indebtedness on your Merchants' Ex
change etoek at the beginning of the year was
$28,000. You have received in regular dividends
on your Merchants' Exchange stock $8488 and
an extra dividend out of Its reserve or building
fund of $25,464, or a total during the year of
{33.952.
You have paid off the indebtedness of $28,000;
also $1200 has been transferred to the Call Board
Association to make up Its deficiency for the
year of $1450; also various expenditures, among
which were $650 unanimously voted the Galves
ton sufferers, leaving a balance of cash on hand
of $2256 85. You now have among your assets
2122 shares of Merchants' Exchange Associa
tion stock (out of a total of 2431 shares Issued)
free of incumbrance, which at the sale value
of $300,000 for the Merchants' Exchange Asso
ciation property will give you $261,867 53. There
will also be a further dividend from the Mer
chants' Exchange stock on the final completion
of the sale and distribution of its assets. Thus
you will realize a value for each membership
something more than $1300 in cash.
It has been the desire and opinion of the
members of this exchange that a more suit
able building, one that would be a credit to this
city, should be provided for its purposes. This
condition Is about to be realized by the union
of your forces with the general merchants,
bankers and manufacturers of this city in the
promotion of the new Merchants' Exchange.
To bring about this most satisfactory condition
has been no easy task, and much credit is due
to your secretary, Mr. Friedlander, in his un
tiring efforts and to your virtually unanimous
subscription to the membership of the new ex
change. We are also under obligations to a few
public-spirited capitalists, who came forward
with liberal cash assistance in the purchase of
the property of the Merchants' Exchange Asso
ciation, thereby guaranteeing the construction
of the proposed building.
San Francisco's Future.
The future importance of San Francisco as
a commercial center. Its geographical position
on the highway to the Orient, is now attracting
the attention of people throughout the United
States. The new Merchants' Exchange, bring
ing together all the mercantile and financial
interests of this city in a strong commercial
union. Is bound to exercise important Influence
in promoting the future greatness of your city.
The President of the United States and part
of his Cabinet have shown their Interest in this
city and coast by having honored it with their
presence. We have also been honored by a
visit of the Harbor and River Congressional
Committee, the Chicago Merchants' Club, as
well as many and large delegations from va
rious societies, and I am sure they return to
their homes and posts of duty with favorable
Impressions of the possibilities of this city and
coast; and the merchants of this city have quite
recently sent a delegation to Washington, in
which your association was represented, to fur
ther the commercial interests of this city in
the establishing of direct communication with
our new possession across the Pacific that we
may have better facilities for trade and com- '
merce with the Philippines and the Orient in
general. '
This city has a great commercial future. Let
us do our part in preparing for it.
I desire to express my appreciation of the
faithful and efficient manner in which I have
been aided by your board of directors, your
secretary, cashier and various committees in
conducting the affairs of this exchange during
the past year. I tender my thanks to them for
their faithful performance of their duties and
for the harmony that has existed among: us.
Most respectfully submitted,
G. W. McNEAR, President.
San Francisco, July 17, 1901.

POUGHKEEPBIE, N. Y., July 17.â
General Daniel Butterfield died at
his home, Craigside, at Cold
Spring, at 8:30 to-night. He had
been In very poor health for a
year or more, and has been in a condition
of semi-paralysis for some time. He
leaves a widow, but no children. About
fifteen years ago he married the widow of
Frederick James of Cold Spring, and she
survives him.
Daniel Butterfleld was born at Utica, N.
T., October 31, 1831, and was graduated
from Union College in 1849, and afterward
for a time went into the service of the
Mohawk division of the New York Central
Railroad, and subsequently became the
general superintendent of the eastern di
vision, of the American Express Company.
He served in the New York militia, Sev
enty-first and Twelfth regiments,-, fron\
1851 to 1861. As colonel of the Twelfth'.
New York militia he went into the war in

SUCCESSFUL LADIES' NIGHT
AT THE OLYMPIC CLUB
Four Little Chinese Boxers Bring
Down the House in Shouts of
Laughter.
Under the direction of Leader John A.
Hammersmith, the ladies' night at the
Olympic Club last evening was one of the
most successful ever given by the club.
William Greer Harrison himself acted as
master of ceremonies. The large gym
nasium, was crowded with visitors, a
large number of members of the shoot
ers' bund being among the specially in
vited guests. â¢ Â¦
The first number on the programme
showed Harold Manor, Joseph Connor,
William Cavanagh, Walter O'Leary, OtTo
Ritter and William K. J. Toohig in some
excellent springboard leaping. George
Head followed with a daring trapeze act,
and then came William F. Karl in the
cleverest bar work seen here in a long
time. He was helped by 'Henry Bailey in
a clown stunt.
Clement Milward and Sam Berger, and
J. E. Britt Jr., introduced as the "cham
pion with the, gloves," and William J.
Leonard put up three rattling rounds of
boxing. Britt and Leonard were the
more clever in their bout, but Britt was a
little too quick and too heavy for his
man.
Harrison now announced the presence
of the bund members, and asked the band
to play "Die Wacht am Rhein" in their
honor, the audience rising. The Olympic
Club then gave three cheers for the bund
members, the visitors returning the com
pliment. Captain Kuhl, president of the
shooting 1 club, was introduced and made
a brief speech.
The members of the Arlon Verein, led
by H. Holzhauer,- sang "Maiennacht,"
with tenor solo by John V. Oppel. A. M.
Stone did some trick Jumping. The turn
Bection of the Verein Elntracht marched
in in force and made many curious pyra
mids. There . was fancy club swinging
by H. Schreiber, Otto Ritter, W. O'Leary
and Professor I Lando.
Then came the event of the evening in
the introduction of four little Chinese
boxers, each not over three feet high and
each a native son. The house came down
in applause, and laughter at their tricks
with the gloves, under the direction of
Trainer Hammersmith.
The "upside down" trapeze act of "Will
iam de Boe -was first class. In the fenc
ing, next on the programme, O. Kehrleln
and E. Kehrlein handled the foils, O.
Ortlon and Professor Tronchet the duel
ing swords and O. Kehrlein and Professor
Tronchet the broadswords. W. J. Leon
ard gave an exhibition of fancy bag
punching, and the evening 1 8 entertain
ment concluded with wrestling bouts be
tween J. Spiro and George Braun, C.
Bayly and Charles Pentony, R. Cornell
and George Hensley, and TV. McCullugh
and Charles Jenkins.

A novel event was held yesterday on the
courts of the California Tennis Club. The
affair was a handicap doubles and singles,
in which only, four men participated.
The first match .was a doubles between
Hugh Hume, and Ray Splivalo and Ray
Cornell and Adrian Splivalo, in which the
latter team allowed their opponets odds
of fifteen. In spite of the large handicap
Cornell and Adrian Splivalo won three
sets out of four, the score In their favor
being- 6 â 0, 6â 2r 4-r6, 6 â 2. Hume had never
played before a. crowd of spectators and
consequently was afflicted with stagÂ©
fright in the early part of the Â¦ match.
Later on. when his nervousness had worn
off. his play improved, and -with the able
assistance of his partner they took : the
third set.
Cornell was the star of the four, but
was little ahead . of his , partner, who
played a very clever game.' Â¦ '
As there -was but one cup offered the
winning team decided to split up and play
a handicap singles match to . see . who
would become tho owner of the prize, and.
Incidentally, the handicap champion of
Belmont. â¢â¢
Cornell agreed to allow his partner In
doubles the largo handicap of thirty each
game. The fact that he either over-esti
mated his own ability or under-estimated
tho ability of his opponent -was soon^ap^
parent, for Splivalo obtained a big lead at
the start and was never headed;
The handicap seemed to worry Cornell
and he was unable to put up his best
game, while Splivalo played very aggres
sively and took many chances, which en
abled him to \rin out rather easily. The
ecore. In Adrian Splivalo'u favor, was 6â2,
6-3. - :
Many spectators from Belmont and the
city were on : hand and were treated to
some very good tennis.

"Did you see The Call to-day? We want

The situation is this: The saloon men

by the Supervisors of the county. ' The
liquor men are obliged under the signed
agreement to pay. counsel fees. .The. City

the public, shall lose any revenue, hence
they intend to flx a city license that will
equal both the city and the county license
hitherto imposed. The prospect Is not a
cheerful one for the liquor dealers. They
will be compelled to pay as much tor li
cense as they formerly paid, and in addi
tion thereto will contribute a fixed sum
to the manipulators of the new law.
To-day Adolph Sllva, Trustee of Sausa
lito, introduced an ordinance in the City
Board taxing all saloons and adding to
the city license a sum equal to the county
license knocked dut by the Kelley-Taylor
law. The Trustees called upon the City

Englishmen Admit That Conduct of
a Team "Was Unsportsmanlike.
LONDON. 'July 17.â Secretary Newburn"
of the English Lawn Tennis Association
was interviewed to-day regarding a cable
gram from the United States imputing
an unsportsmanlike spirit to the English
lawn tennis team in refusing to go to the
United States. Newburn said.:

reerets it more than the officers of the asso
ciation It happened in this way: R. F. and

days 'when H. F. Doherty said the doctors
had told him he must not play any more, and
H K Doherty gave a similar excuse. Hill
yard said he would not go if the Dohertys did
not Eaves' backed out and Smith could not
alter his business in order to take the trip. "We
were all UDset, but endeavored to get up a
team of second-raters in order not to dis
appoint the Americans. These players, how
ever having had no expectation of being
asked could not make the necessary business
and Personal arraneements upon short notice.
"We miKht perhaps have obtained third-class
men Â» but we thought it better to cancel the
whole arrangement than to send over an un
steadv lot. We urged the players to go. but
witho"ut â¢ effect. It was impossible for A. "W.
Gore to get away. . â¢
What makes the matter worsa Is that
Messrs. "Ward and Davis, who came here and
eot beaten, behaved in a ; thoroughly sports
manlike way. Americans cannot . make any
more severe comments upon our leading play
ers than we do ourselves. I have .written ex
plaining, expressing deep regret, and . hoping
the Americans will accept â¢ our challenge . for

certainly be within their rights after the way

The Central Theater has a very good
production of "Michael Strogoff" this

good work as the Russian hero, and the
settings of the play are' of the best. De
cidedly one of the most effective stage il
lusions ever seen here is the rea..stic

the third act of the play. The scene
represents a city built upon the hills be

fect of the gradual creeping up of the
flames, the quick spreading of the de
stroying element, the destruction of one
building after another, and the final
crashing down of the walls into a heap of

MAN ACCUSED OF BRUTAL MURDER OF LITTLE GIRL LISTENS IN
TENTLY TO TESTIMONY GIVEN BY CHILD'S BROTHER AND A
WOMAN NEIGHBOR, WHO SAW THE SHOOTING. ,
feÂ»|-^HE preliminary examination of
1 j Robert G. Wilson, ex-pollce otneer,
if on the charge of murder for
il shooting and killing Maggie Hart
well, the little girl, on Shipley
etreet, July 4, was commenced before
Judge Conlan yesterday afternoon. The
defendant was represented by ex-Judge
Bahrs and ex-Judge Ferral and the pros
ecution by Assistant District Attorneys
Alvord and Igniting.
Wilson was' accompanied Into court by
his wife and some friends. He took a
deep Interest in the testimony given by
the witnesses, and several times prompted
his attorneys to ask questions. The most
notable feature of the examination yes
terday was the contradictory evidence
given by George Hartwell, a brother of
the murdered girl, and Mrs. A. Cademar
torf under cross-examination. The boy
also contradicted the evidence that he
gave at the Coroner's inquest in some
particulars.
The boy testified that before Wilson
fired the shot he and Mrs. Wilson were
Bitting on their front porch. After a fire
cracker had been thrown, which went
over a tree and landed on Wilson's porch.
"Wilson stepped from the porch, took hold
of a post with a flat top with his right
hand and placing his left hand in his hip
pocket pulled out a revolver and flred into
the crowd of boys and srirls, the bullet
striking his sister- He did not see Mrs.
Wilson on the porch after the shot was
flred.
Mrs. Cademartori testified that she lived

GREAT RECORDS
DETROIT, July 17.â In the free-for-all
pace this afternoon at the Grosse Pointe
track. Coney, the favorite, went the
fastest mile ever traveled in a. contest
Â¦upon the track, going the distance In 2:02,
â¢which is three-fourths of a second better
than the gelding's previous record. The
attendance Â¦was 5000.
Indiana had the pole in the first heat.
The four horses were eent off to a perfect
start. As they rounded the first turn
Coney took the pole and led, with. Ana
conda next. When they flashed by the
quarter pole every one realized that it was
a fast quarter and enthusiastic cheers
opposite Wilson's house, and after the
firecracker, hai exploded and (fallen on
Wilson's Wilson came from the
porch with his hands in his pockets. He
leaned against the post with a round ball
on top, put his right hand in his hip
pocket,, pulled out a revolver and flred
into the crowd. She did not see any one
except "Wilson on the " porch before or
after the shot was flred. She was positive
that It was the post with the ball on top
against which Wilson leaned before he
flred the shot and that he used his right
hand. -
The boy was recalled, and Â¦ on . being
again questioned repeated that It was the
post with a flat top that Wilson grasped
with his right . hand, while he fired the
shot with his left hand. The witness
said he had nis eyes on Wilson all the
time.
The other witnesses examined were Cor
poral George Russell, who produced a dia
gram of the scene of the shooting, which
he had made,~and Dr. Giannlnl, who made
the autopsy on the girl's body at the
Morgue.
. The defense 4 will not put on any wit
nesses, but there are many more to be
examined for the prosecution. The exam
ination will be resumed this afternoon.
It is proposed that on the first day of
the meeting, which is Tuesday, July 30,
ladies shall be admitted free, and as there
are many stylish turnouts in Sacramento
that are driven by ladles the association
will offer a handsome prize for the finest
single or double rig that will be shown
on the first day of the meeting. It 'is ex
pected that, there will be a number of
competitors for this prize.
All six of the $1000 purses for the breed
ers' meeting that closed on the 1st of July
were declared tilled. There were seven
teen entries in the 2:25 class pace, and all of
the other classes filled with big fields. The
association closed purses on the 15th for
the balance of the programme, and in ad
dition to the regular events there will be
three or four road races for members of
the Golden Gate Park Driving Club of
San Francisco and for the Sacramento
Driving Club. These races will excite a
great deal of local Interest, as owners are
to drive.
One of the sensational races of the meet
ing will be the 2:14 trot, in which are en
tered Richmond Chief, . 2:13Vi; Oseto,
2:13^.; Lottie, 2:15; McBriar, 2:14; Anzella.
2:13%; McNally, 2:15; Boydello, 2:14%; Ned
Thorne, 2:15^4, and the green mare, Nora
McKinney. There never has been a more
closely matched field of fast trotters
named for a race in California than these
nine horses. Each and every one of the
record horses has been working around
his mark lately, and wonderful stories
have come up from San Jose about
"Farmer" Bunch's mare Nora McKinney,'
so that there is a strong feeling among
the trainers that no matter how fast they
go in this race the McKinney mare will
be up among the money-winners. It
should surprise no one if it take six or
seven heats to deside the winner of the
2:14 tret.
- Among the stand-bys that will be seen
in tho sulky are "Farmer" Bunch, who
has a better string this year than he ever
started out with before; Ed Lafferty,
whose string is not a large one, but con
tains several extra good prospects; "Wal
ter Maben, who recently arrived in Sac
ramento wtih several fast ones from the
citrus belt; Sam Hoy, C. A. Durfee, I. H.
Mulholland, Billy Donathan, Al McDon

are accustomed to bringing out horses

A SAN FRANCISCO PHYSICIAN.
Uses Herpid.de Successfully in Treat-
ing Sycosis of the Beard.
He says: ~I recently treated a case of
6ycosis (similar to 'barber's Itch') of the
lower lip with Newbro's Herpldde. There
Teas an extensive loss of beard, with in-
flammatlon extending well down . on the
chin. The result of the application of
Herplcide was most gratifying. The loss
of beard ceased and a new growth of hair
is now taking place over the once in-
flamed area.

ly cooked and can bÂ« used either dry or
with the addition of some milk op cream.
This Food 1b used by some epicures in
frying fish, for it adds & delightful flavor
and is naturally superior to the ordinary
crumbed crackers or cornmeal . for this
purpose. In addition: to the' 4 conveniencÂ©

though the market was not a weak one. It
was, however, a nervous one and a covering
movement followed reports of damage to the
French crop. September rallying to 68%c. An

French account, It was said, turned the tide
again and the market closed firm, September

' Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, July 17.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: .
The wool market is stronger and more active.
The increased business has been very unevenly
distributed, however, a half-dozen houses hav
ing transacted the bulk of the business. The
demand has -been chiefly for Territories and
Oregon wools, although an interest has been
manifested in fleeces, all of which have been
moved at full prices. The trend of the market
on fine stocks is toward a higher level and a
better inquiry is noted for medium etock. Some
dealers report that it is impossible to get
higher prices, but on fine wools better prices
certainly have been obtained than could have
been secured two or three weeks ago. From
the lowest point touched in the past year there
has been a recovery from 2c ' to 4c per scoured
pound, or say 5 to 10 per cent. The sales for
the week in Boston amounted to 6,780,000 pounds
domestic and 140,000 foreign, making a total of
6.920.0CO pounds, against a totalof 3.SS2.700 for
the previous week, and a total of 1,663,000
pounds for the corresponding week last year.
The receipts of wool in Boston this week
amount to 29,241 bales, against 14,843 last week
and 17,245 last year.
Shipments of wool for the week ending July
15 aggregate 5,662.799 pounds. This shows an
Increase of 1,939,688 pounds over the shipments
of 3,723,021 pounds for the previous week. Since
January 1 the shipments amount to 131,725,18o
pounds. - *Â¦

again. The opinion, wa3 growing that the crop
damage to Corn was fully as serious as . had
been reported. The â¢ Northwest reported blight
in spring Wheat in Minnesota and i South Da
kota and French authorities estimated the Im
port-requirements of France at 100,000,000 bush

purchases in ' the Southwestern markets for
French account, and about 1,000,000 bushels
was Â¦ sold around 68c bx i Chicago, commission
houses. The weather was reported clearing
throughout the West and speculators considered
the rainfall Insufficient: The condition of the
crop in the Northwest was said to be excellent,
however, with a fair prospect of 200,000 bushels,
and New York sold heavily.

NEW YORK. July 17.â Early knowledge of
the terms of Mr. Morgan's letter nominating
the members of the Northern Pacific board of
directors to fill the vacancies to be created
v.rs undoubtedly the cause of the emphatic
recovery In prices of stocks to-day. The first
intimation of the news came to the street
through the open buying of round amounts of
various stocks by brokers generally understood
to act for both the Morgan and the Harri
man interests. The fact of this buying was
evidence of the satisfaction felt by both.par
ties to tie Xcrthern Pacific contest over the
terms of eettlement, provided for by Mr. Mor
gan's action, aside from the strong assurance
felt 'rom the perÂ«onality of the new members
of the board that a fair and satisfactory ad
justment would be secured. The additional
recommendation for the immediate reconstruc
tion of the board rather than to await the
regular meeting In October was a further
cause of relief to the speculative mind: The
conviction that an early settlement of the
Kcithern Pacific controversy was at hand,
which permeated the market all the morning,
was crystallized by the rather spectacular de
vice of a sale cf 200 shares of Northern Pa
cific common stock on the board. The price
Â»-.-Â« 118. The mute record on the tape com
ing smoothly from the ticker with the quota
tion Jumbled in whatever line of the trans

the most disastrous quarrel that ever unsettled
values in Wall Mreet. The last of the strag
gling transactions in the stock which followed
the sale for J10C0 in the culmination 5 of the
comer In the panic of May 9 was made on
June 3, when the stock 6old at 150, which waa
the settlement price offered by insiders to
Fhorts. . Finee that time the stock has disap
peared from the market and there has not been
evr>n a nominal quotation for it. The reap
pearance of the stock on the tape was imme
diately followed by a violent bound in prices.
There were occasional l.auses in the move
ment, but no notable recessions in prices.
New buyins: orders came into the market In
piccpsslve installments for enormous blocks.
The stock* of the railroads Immediately af
fected were naturally the leaders in the move
ment, but the strnncth cpread to other parts
of t!ie market and all other considerations
were Ignored. A rumor that thÂ° steel strike
would be settled within forty-eight hours en
tlrelv fniled cf- corroboratlon. but the recov
ery in the steel stocks continued without in
terruption. The' news of the day pointed to
additional recruits for the striklns employes
of the Anthracite companies, but the early
weakness in the coalers was wiped out and
the stock* made buoyant advances over last
night'e level, extending in the case of Erie
first preferred 3%. The declaration of the
first dividend on this stock of 14 per cent,
presumably for the half-yearly period, helped
the advance, although there had been talk
that the stock would be placed on a 4 per

ITALIANS MAY
MAKE DEMANDS
WASHINGTON 1 . July 17.â The Italian
Government has taken cognizance of &
recent affray at Erwin, Miss., in which it
is claimed two Italians were lynched and
a third seriously grounded. The facts have
been communicated to the Foreign Office
at Rome and the Italian Embassy here
has made representations to the State
Department. At the same time the Ital
ian authorities are pursuing an investi
gation of their own through their Con
sul at New Orleans and their Consular
Agent at Vicksburg, Miss., which is not
far from the scene of the alleged trouble.
Thus far the reports received from these
officials establish the essential points ln
what is considered a rather serious condi
tion of affairs. First, it is reported posi
tively that the Italians were killed by
lynching. Second, the Italian authorities
nearest the scene of the trouble have
established to their satisfaction that the
persons killed are Italian subjects ln the
full sense, not having taken out natural
ization papers. There is every indication
that the facts will constitute an Interna
tional incident similar to that with Italy
-growing out of the killing of Italians in
Louisiana.
The first report of the trouble at Erwin
came In a brief press dispatch four or
five days ago. The Italian Consular of
ficers at New Orleans and Vlcksburg have
since made telegraphic reports, and the
Italian Charge d'Affaires, Carignani, took
prompt action ln advising his Government
and in laying the matter before the State
Department. The department has ren
dered every assistance possible, although
this again has disclosed the difficulties of
Federal action in a matter occurring
within the jurisdiction of a State. The
Governor of Mississippi, it is reported,
will proceed" In person to Erwln to Investi
gate the matter.

SACRAMENTO. July 17.â A week has
elapsed since a resolution introduced by
Governor Gage was passed by the Capitol
Commissioners, removing State Gardener
Dunn' from office and requiring that the
facts of his case be laid before Attorney
General Ford for such legal action as he
might deem proper. The resolution bore
every evidence of having been carefully
framed, with the Idea of political effect
uppermost. It expressly "passed up" the
responsibility of Dunn's presence in of
fice to former Governors Markham and
Budd. and represented that he was kept
in office during the Gage regime only upon
the earnest solicitation of the two ex-
Governors and others high ln the councils
of state. In fact. Governor Gage was
exhibited before a. sympathetic constit
uency as one whose confidence had been
grossly betrayed and when the typewrit
ten and carbon-copied resolution closed
with a direction that the Attorney Gen
eral be given the facts of the Stata
Gardener's misdeeds, it seemed that be
fore Dunn loomed the penitentiary and
behind him stalked the turnkey.
But It develops that the manifestation
of outraged virtue was only a sample oC
current gubernatorial "hot air." Attorney
General Ford declares that he has receiv
ed no communication whatever on the
subject of Dunn's offenses against the law
either from the Governor's office or the
Capitol Commissioners and this afternoon
the secretary of the latter body admitted
the truth of this statement. Meanwhile
Dunn received the advice of friends that
he would better take his departure while
there was no hindrance to his doing so
and he fled on Saturday night and is by
some believed to be in British Columbia,
Absolutely no effort has been made either
to prevent Dunn's departure, to ascertain
his whereabouts or to communicate thÂ©
facts of his criminality to the Attorney
General.
â¢ On top of this confessed inaction comes
the positive statement of A. C. Remick,
a well-known meat merchant of Sacra
mento, that Governor Gage either knew
all about Dunn's dishonesty when he took
office or had ample opportunity to find It
out. Remick was a deputy in the office
of State Treasurer Rackliffe up to the
latter's death. He asserts that he and a
number of other attaches of the Capitol
and even of the grounds superintended by
Dunn, addressed and filed with the pres
ent Capitol Commissioners early in Gov
ernor Gage's term a petition in which
they charged Dunn with rascality and
with being unfit to retain the place. No
attention whatever was paid to the peti
tion either by the Governor or the other
commissioners. Remick laughs at the
Idea of Gage holding his predecessors re
sponsible for Dunn's presence. Dunn has
all along been credited with a potent pull
at the Capitol.

Colonel "William H. Heuer, United
States engineer in charge of the Improve
ment of rivers and harbors In California,
has sent his annual report to Washington.
It contains the annual recommendations
that are the basis of work when the Com
mittee on Rivers and Harbors takes up
the question of improvements for the wat
erways of this State. It will be found that
the recommendations do not Include any
for large new improvements. From this
It should not be inferred that Colonel
Heuer is not advocating many., things that
are earnestly desired and were strongly
recommended by Congressmen and others
when the Committee on Rivers and Har
bors was here recently. In fact, all' tne
work that he has specifically mentioned
in earlier reports, upon which action has
not been taken, is still under consideration
with Colonel Heuer's favorable recom
mendations.
"Until a recommendation Is disposed of.
said Colonel Heuer yesterday. "It is still
pending. Congressmen can turn back to
the files. As a matter of fact there are
several large and important matters that
have been brought to the attention of
Congress which may be possibly taken
up at the next session. Among these are
the improvement of the channel to Mare
Island to enable the passage of large war
vessels to the navy yard to be repaired
or for other purposes: the deepening -of
the water above the Suisun flat, the flat
being five or six miles long; the construc
tion of a canal around the city of Stock
ton: the Oakland harbor improvements,
including the tidal canal, etc. These are
just as much before Congress as if they
were included In the last report. The
estimates have been made and the works
have been described ln connection with
earlier reports.
i"A recommendation has been made for
an appropriation for the snagging of the
Upper, Sacramento River, the amount
asked being $25,000. There is a large ton
nage that moves on the river above the
city Of Sacramento, something like half a
million tons per annum. The' failure of
the river and harbor bill in the last Con
gress has left snagging to be done by the
State or not done at all. A contract has
been recently entered into by the State
for keeping navigation of the upper river
open by the removal of snags. When
there is high water it Is possible to go to
one side of a snag, -but not so when the
water is low. Our aim is to keep the water
seven feet deep at low, water to Sacra
mento, four feet deep to Colusa and three
feet deep to Red Bluff. These are the
present depths and they enable barges to
move freight above Sacramento."
HEUER REPORTS

Colonel Ed F. Browne of Aspen, Colo.,
made an address on the same lines. He
gave many statistics to show the impor
tance of the mining industry, and de
clared that it had been misrepresented
in Government reports; that more than
10 per cent of the exports of the coun
try last year were the unmanufactured
products of mining.
Sidney Story of New Orleans ma.de an
Interesting address on the question of
building the Nicaraguan canal. He de
clared that the building of the canal by
the United State3 was rendered more
necessary by the attitude of European
nations, which are discriminating against
American products. The canal would en
able Americans to greatly extend their
trade in the Orient. He much preferred
the Nicaragua route to that across the
Isthmus of Panama.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion submitted its report, which was
adopted. The following are the officers
elected: President, John Henry Smith of
Utah; first vice president, Leon Bryson
of Iowa; second vice president, L. Brad
ford Prince of New Mexico: third vice
president, J. S. Whelis of Texas: fourth
vice president, ex-Governor Seay of Ok
lahoma. The other officers are chosen by
the executive committee and will be
named to-morrow. The members of the
executive committee are selected by the
different delegations.
At the evening session Congressman
Chester I* Long- of Kansas spoke on the
subject. "Our Trade Should Go Under
Our Flag," and Charles J. Moore of Crip
ple Creek gave a. lecture illustrated by
stereoptlcon on "The 'Formation of the
Cripple Creek and Leadville Mining Dis
tricts." ; L. ,
Francis B. . Thurber .of New York,
president of the United States Export
Association, closed the evening session
with an address on "What Shall We Do
With Our Surplus Products?" He said
that our great national resources in
fields, forests, mines and factories de
manded wider markets; that there are fif
teen hundred millions of people in the
world, and "the field is the world.*
At the morning session of the congress
ex-Secretary Noble expressed himself as
opposed to a department of mines in the
Government on the ground that the laws
regulating mining are made by the States
and not by the Oeneral Government. He
favored a bureau of mines to test and dis
seminate information regarding mines
and treatment of ores. A department of
commerce, whose head should be a mem
ber of the President's Cabinet, he declared
to be a necessity.
The address of Robert Graham of Crip-
T>le Creek was in favor of a department
of mining whose head shall be a member
of the President's Cabinet.

Conclave of Sons of St. George.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 17.
The Grand Lodge of the Order of the
Sons of St. George adjourned sine die thia
evening
San Francisco was chosen as the next
place of meeting after a spirited contest
by the Canadian delegates, who wanted the
next Grand Lodge to convene on British
soil, at Vancouver. The Americans were
in a big majority, however, and the only
question was as to which city in Cali
fornia should be selected. The next Grand
Lodge will meet on the fourth Tuesday
of next January. â¢
The opening of the ballots for the vari
ous officers placed the Grand Lodge in a
delicate position with regard to the in
stallation #f M. H. Dunn, the recently de
posed Stare gardener, who was declared
elected to the office of grand vice presi
dent of the order. Dunn saved the Grand
Lodge any difficulty in this connection
by forwarding his resignation, which was
accepted. W. H. Fuller of San Francisco
was elected to fl.ll the vacancy so created.

president, Thomas Bradbury of Nanaimo,

corps, Â¦ under command of Major . Mor
risey, had three litters on hand to carry
off the wounded. The defenders of the
camp formed a solid bulwark at the base
of the tall pole and with sabers uplifted
prevented the attacking forces . chopping
away the halyards.
One section waa sent to the west of the
camp, ln command of Captain Grimley,
and the other moved out on the plain -to
meet the enemy. McGloin had ordered
one battalion to enter from the northeast
portion of the camp, bo that the cadets
would be shielded by the trees and hospi
tal tents. The other battalion, command
ed by himself, crept in from the south
east and was shielded from view by a big
winery. A deep ravine in the center of
the plain and the tall grass made the
spot an ideal one for carrying out the at
tack and defense. Gaughran brought his
men through the tall grass and concealed
them close to the ravine. The cadets lay
in ambush and awaited the coming of the
enemy. McGloin â¢ rushed his men across
the field* and down the ravine and as they
dashed up the slope they were met and
repulsed. There was a terrific clashing
of sabers and hand to hand scuffling.
Sergeant Dave Torres deserved a medal
for bravery. He captured the colors car
ried by the enemy. Within a few minutes
McGloin and his entire battalion were
prisoners.
taken the regiment out, and after in
structing it in battalion formations di
vided it into two battalions. He then sent
scouts out on both nanks of the camp to
discover the best mode of attack. Gaugh
ran was In his tent and happened to spy
the scouts. He immediately surmised that
an attack was imminent. He ordered the
buglers to blow the assembly, and this
was followed quickly by the call "To
arms." The guards were drawn ln within
a few minutes. All the convalescents were
ordered to repulse the attack. Gaughran
assumed command of the squad of sev
enty men. After formation he deployed a
line of skirmishers, divided ln two sec
tions, consisting of two platoons in each
section. ,-,

Private Buckley has written tha following
lines to be sung to the tune of the popular
melody known as "Sue, Dear":
"Stew, stew, stew, I have had enough of you.
The only thing we can get to. eat is stew, stew.
\ stew. .
It ls strong enough to walk, It is loud enough
i to talk, \ .
With an ax you cannot separate the gravy.
It has whiskers like a billy goat.
And you cannot ram It down your throat.
If you ; throw some of this antiquated stew,
stew
Overboard, this stew will float.
CHORUS.
"This Is*, great stew, :
It only weighs a ton, too,
It is rough and It is tough
And It is old and gray.
More than one stew j >
Will be paralzyed for life, too,
From trying to eat that tough stew
. In the .same old way.".
'More pie' rings ln your ears,
And when Max shouts out 'the ple'a all gone'

"How Deacon Jones did roll his eyes
When the watermelon came.
And when the Doc told him about stomach
aches
Said: 'Well, dls coon will be to blame.'
And then there's Dr. Toothache Doyle
Who roams about all night,
With a pair of tongs and saluting you
With, 'Good morning, | are your teeth all
right?'
And Dr. Morrlsey, who just arrived
With a car load of black pills.
Compelling the boys to swallow onÂ» ,'
For any kind of ills."

"These views I have met with In the
Hast and are in part my own conclusions.
It was thirty years after Alaska was a
Territory before she received proper rec
ognition. I have been given to understand
that the natives of the islands do not fa
vor the- suggestion. This is largely a mat
ter of Eentiment, which I can readily un
derstand."
"I may say here that the idea of annex
ation of the islands to California was sug
gested to me in the East and has been
talked of for some time. There is strong
objection to giving statehood to Hawaii,
chiefly an account of the small proportion
of whites in the islands and also on ac
count of the distance between Hawaii and
the mainland. The Hawaiian Islands are
in such a position that they may at any
lime suffer from a move on the world's
political or commercial checker-board.
Remove the center of the world's com
merce from the Pacific Ocean and Hawaii
would soon be forgotten.
"If there is a movement for annexa
tion," said Dr. Jordan, "I did not originate
it. One day while I was talking with Mr.
Fitch he spoke of the possibility of duty
between Hawaii and the mainland, in
view of the recent decision of the United
States Supreme Court as to the status of
Territories, and I replied that I thought
the best and safest thing for Hawaii was
annexation to California.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of
Stanford University, in an interview hero
states that, though he was the first to
give in Honolulu expression to the opin
ion that Hawaii ought to be annexed to
California, he has no connection with the
movement to put the scheme into effect.
HONOLULU, H. T., July 9.â Politics in
Hawaii just now centers in the proposition
to annex the Territory to California. The
administration or "missionary" newspa-
Sers here declare that Circuit Judge
[umphreys, who is now in the States, en
tered into a political "conspiracy" with
others here to spring the proposition and
try to carry it in California and the
United States. The home-rulers appear to
be bitterly opposed to it and Humphreys
is accused of betraying them. The old
row has broken out again, with
Humphreys as the target of both the
"missionary" and many of the home rule
leaders.

vices in 1898 Further
Some" of the protesting teachers waived
their objections and received their back
pay as per agreement, but ethers remained
obdurate, and the injunction was the re
sult.
A committee of teachers, headed by C
HI Murphy and "W. D. Kingsbury. waited
on Auditor "Wells and entered a protest
on behalf of those who were not willing
to sign the agreement. It appears that a
minority of the teachers are disinclined to
pay back the money to the merchants, and
Murphy and Kingsbury desired to lay
their plaint before the Auditor. The lat
ter, who is acting as a sort of peacemaker,
became angry when Murphy characterized
the proceedings as a "hold-up" of the
teachers. "Wells informed Murphy and
his associates that the money was legally
due the merchants, as after the teachers
had received their back salaries they will
have received an aggregate sum of $7000
above the city's indebtedness to them.
There was a steady stream of teachers
passing through the Auditor's office in
the morning, all of them signing agree
ments to pay back: the amounts they had
previously received from the funds to
which the merchants had waived claim a
year ago.
The injunction is the result of the action
of a minority of the teachers, who pro
tested yesterday against the agreement
between the merchants' creditors and the
teachers, â¢whereby the teachers were to
be assessed proportionately to reimburse
the merchants for their surrendered
claims. The injunction was applied for
by one of the merchants through his at
torney. Senator J. C. Siras. The writ was
made returnable July 19, but a postpone
ment Â¦will probably be granted. Lloyd &
"Wood will represent Auditor "Wells.
A temporary injunction was granted by
Judge Dunne yesterday restraining Aud
itor Wells from approving teachers' de
mands for salaries for November and De
cember. 1S9S. The Auditor had already
authorized payment of claims to the
amount of 540,000 out of the $127,000 of 1S98
claims.

*r.Curr. elzned by you under date of May 21.
i:Â»Cl. under which the composition of the board
of directors of the Northern Pacific Railroad
to be elected at the nest annual meeting was
left In my hands, I beg leave to advise you of
r:y conclusions, as follows:
I nominate the following rentlemen as the
new members of the board to fill the vacan
cies to be created: James P. Hill, president
Great Northern: E. H. Harrima.n, chairman

cific Railway; TV. E. Rockefeller, director of
the Chicago. Milwaukee and St. Paul; J.
McK. Twombley. director of the Chicago and
Northwestern Railway: Samuel Rea, vice
president of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
1 would sursest that the attention of the
board be called to the advisability of arrang-
lns for these gentlemen to assume their duties
as directors of the company as soon as pos
sible without awaitlnjr the annual election.
It is my opinion that a board thus constituted
will contain within itself the elements best
adapted for the formulation of a plan referred
to ln said memorandum ln connection with
tTiliiani K. V&nderbilt, named therein as
referee. Every important interest will have
its representative, who will be brought into
cloce touch Â¦with the situation as a whole, and
there Fhould be no difficulty ln reachlns a
conclusion that will be fair and Just to all
concerned and tend to the establishment of
permanent harmony among the different lines
To this end I 6hall be rlad to co-ouerate ln
puch manner as will seem desirable. I am.

The grain handlers' strike at Port Cos- j

some of Â» the sugar fleet. ' The men that i
handle the latter vessels' cargoes are in
sympathy with the^grain handlers, and
Monday when the Gerard C. Tobey was
towed to Crockett they refused to work
the ship. The owners at once sent a tug
up the river and towed the bark to Oak
land, where she is now discharging. Until
the strike is over no more vessels will go
to Crockett to discharge. The bark Kalu

CLERK DIMMICK
TO LEAVE MINT
â¢ â Â¦ â
Search for Gold -Thief
to Be Continued
With Vigor.
*- â
Officials Are Hopeful of Find
ing Evidence to
Convict.
-â â Â¦ Â¦Â» Â¦ Â¦ Â¦-â â¢ fc
Walter r Dimmick, chief clerk at the
Mint, will not hold hla position many
days. The notice given to him three
months ago by Superintendent Leach
that he must find another position will go
into force ere the week is ended.
Meanwhile the investigation as to the
of the Mint employe who stole
JoO.COO in gold coin proceeds. The count of
all the gold in the Mint will be finished
by to-morrow. Yesterday over 55,000,000
was. inspected and resacked. No short
age has been found in any of the sacks
inspected.
Superintendent Leach was seen yester
day afternoon and made the following
statement: ....
"It is not fair to myself or other Federal
officials for anyone to say that we have
been lukewarm in our investigation. We
are unable to give out the result of our
investigations, as it would defeat the ends
we are working for. I will say, however,
that men have been arrested on far less
evidence than we have secured in this
case. Personally I have no power to
order the arrest of any suspected em
ploye. The matter rests with the Secret
Service Agents and the United -States
I>istrict Attorney.
"The newspapers and the public mu3t
understand that it is impossible for us
to give out every fact that we have dis
covered. Too much has already been
made public. There is not an employe in
the Mint who would not give half a
month's salary to see the thief arrest
ed and convicted. Â¦
"It i3 inadvisaBle to arrest a- man on
moral evidence. Legal proof must be
produced, and the aim *of our investiga
tion has been to secure that proof.
"V wl11 stat e that the search for tKe
thief will not be abandoned. It must be
realized that sometimes it is not wise to
arrest a suspected person immediately
suspicion rests on him. i
Â¦ktV j V j re Â£ards Dimmick remaining in the
Mint employ, if you will watch events for
the next few days you will probably se
cure the information you desire;," -
It was learned last evening from a Mint
omcial that Dimmick would Â¦ leave . the
employ of the' Government, in a few days.

DISCUSS RATES
Passenger Agents Decide
on Joint Card Pub-
Adjustment of Schedules for
Clergymen and the
Employes.
? Â¦ Â¦Â¦
GLEXWOOD SPRINGS, Col.T July 17.â
The Transcontinental Passenger Associa
tion continued its session at the Hotel
Colorado to-day. "A proposition to pub
lish 'joint rate sheets semi-annually v;as
adopted. The application of the Knights
of Pythias for rates to their convention
to be held ai San Francisco In 1902 was
laid over until the next meeting. *
The matter of special rates to the Pan-
American Exposition at Buffalo was re
ferred to the California terminal lines for
action. A proposition to fix an arbitrary
charge for changing return routes for"
California excursion tickets after arrival
In California was laid on the table but
will probably be taken up for further ac
tion at the next meeting. The transpor
tation of officers of the army and navy
was referred to the California terminal
lines. The matter of rates to clergymen
and railroad employes from the ?Jissourl
River to the Northern Pacific Coast were
adjusted to the complete satisfaction of
all competing' lines.
The proposition to establish joint agen
cies at Los An.?ele3 was under discussion
and finally referred to a special committee
to report at the next meeting of the asso
ciation. For the fifth annual meeting nt
the National Livestock Association to be
held a Chicago in 1DC2 it was voted that a
rate equivalent to one fare and one-third
be made.

BALFOUR. GUTHRIE & CO.. Gen. AÂ«eat_At the office of the Oriental Steamship
Company last evening- it was denied that
Strong and Lady Hope were on board the
Nippon Maru. The passenger list was
produced as proof that the elopers had
uot sailed on the companv'g vessel.
Inquiries as to the identity of "Mr. and
Mrs. Smith and two servants." booked in
the passenger list for Kobe, Japan, failed
to elicit any information as to who the
travelers were.
When the Nippon Maru pulled out into
the stream the head of a man in a straw
bat was seen at one of the ground glass
Â¦windows of the forward suite on the port
side of the ship, while a woman's head,
\-earing a sailor straw hat. was observed
at the adjoining window. These windows
belonged to rooms occupied by Strong and
Lady Hope.
The suite of rooms in which Strong and
Lady Hope were hiding were locked and
tfce curtains were carefully pinned over
the porthole facing- the forward part of
the Fhip. All the officers of the Nippon
Maru claimed that they knew nothing of
Strong and Lady Hope being on board,
but a minute before the ship pulled out
of her berth one of the officers admitted
that the couple were in hiding. Orders
had been issued by the officials of the
company that nothing should be given out
in the matter.
On Tuesday Strong and Lady Hope
went on board the Nippon Maru and spent
the night in a suite of rooms forward on
the upper deck. Early yesterday morn
ing the dogs belonging to the ex-army
officer were brought to the Mail dock and
placed by Strong's^ servants in a room of
the ship. Strong was seen In consultation
with onÂ© of the officials of the steamship
line on the deck of the vessel.
The greatest secrecy was maintained as
to the departure of the notorious couple,
the officials of the steamship company
and the officers of the vessel profess
ing entire ignorance of the presence of
Strong and his companion on board.
Putnam Bradlee Strong, late captain in
the United States army, accompanied by
Lady Francis Hope, sailed for the Orient

Baron von Polenz, an officer of a crack
German cavalry regiment, who arrived
hero last April from China, and who at
tempted to cut a wide swath in local so
ciety circles, is in trouble In Los Angeles.
A prominent attorney from Los Angeles
arrived here last night with an order to
search the Baron's trunks, which have
been attached by the proprietors of the
Palace Hotel and held pending the pay
ment of a bill for board owed by the Ger
man army officer. The Los Angeles law
yer claims that the Baron's trunks con
tain papers of great value to a number
of people in Los Angeles.
When the Baron arrived here from Chi
na last April he possessed considerable
means which he immediately proceeded
to spend in a manner befitting a member
of the German nobility. When he had
spent all his "fortune" he left for Los
Angeles,- leaving his trunks as security
for an unpaid board bill.
While in Los Angeles he succeeded in
interesting a number of wealthy residents
of the City of Angles in a patent, which
he claimed had been sold to the German
Government. The patent, the Baron said,
would yield immense profits to any one
who would take it up. He claimed that
all the papers which were necessary to
prove his identity with the German nobil
ity were in the trunks held by the Palace
Hotel management.

Now, however, the prisoner has brought her
self before me on habeas corpus proceedings
After remarking that the question pre
sented had never arisen before In the his
tory of the country and that it should be
decided by the Supreme Court of the
United States, he continued:
If the petitioner applied to the Federal courts
for a writ of habeas corpus and appealed to the
United States Supreme Court, all proceedings
by this court until decided by the United States
Supreme Court would be null and void. There
fore it seems to me it would be highly improper
for this court to proceed to set this case for
trial â that is. the indictment for trial, and
order witnesses brought here from Delaware at
an expense, of $9000 -or 110,000, when the case
could not be tried. Counsel for the
officers of the court, stated in open court that
it is their intention, should this writ of error
be refused, they will take the question of Juris
diction to the Federal courts upon such habeas
corpus proceedings, and it seems to me that a
decision will be reached much earlier by allow
ing the writ now than by forcing counsel into
the Federal courts . on habeas corpus proceed
ings, as the case cannot be tried pending any
Buch proceedings in the Federal courts. .
Judge Cook took under advisement
Tuesday the request of . the defendant's
attorneys for leave to apply for a writ of
error to the Federal courts, and yester
day morning he consented to grant their
request and in doing so gave, among
others, the following reasons: .
The attorneys for Mrs. Cordelia Botkin,
charged with murder, have gained their
point and will have the question of juris
diction passed upon by the highest court
in the land. In the meantime the date
for the second trial of the defendant Is
indefinite.
Â¦ If I am wrong in. holding that this State ha3
jurisdiction and if the Supreme Court of this
State is wrong In affirming my ruling, and a
writ of error in this case to the Supreme Court
of the United States Is granted, that court will
so advise me and my order of remand will be
by that court reversed, in which case the pris
oner will still be before me on proceedings
which she, herself, has invoked, and under sec
tion. 1493 of the habeas corpus act of the- Penal
Code of this State I can, should the Supreme
Court of the United States hold the crime
triable only in Delaware, order her delivered
into the custody of that State.
and has herself invoked the habeas corpus stat
ute of this State. That statute bo invoked by
her gives me the power unaer section 1493, as
follows: "In cases where any party is held
under illegal restraint or custody, or any other
person is entitled to the restraint or custody of
such party, the Judge or courc may order such
party to be committed to the restraint or cus
tody of such person as is by law entitled
thereto." ...'..
Notwithstanding the verdict of the Cor
oner's Jury that William Hoist, the vic
tim of the Pacific Stained Glass "Works
fire, met with an accidental death, Cap
tain of Detectives Seymour is satisfied
that he committed suicide. Hoist had
been despondent since the death of his
wife, a short time ago, and frequently de
clared his intention to commit suicide.
Early Tuesday, morning fire was discov
ered in the glass works, of which Hoist
was the proprietor, and an alarm was
rung in from the nearest box. Despite
the efforts of the lire Department, the
place was soon reduced to ashes. As no
trace of Hoist, who was in the habit of
sleeping in the works, could be found sev
eral of his friends started a search for
him. They discovered the charred re
mains of the unfortunate man under a
pile of burning timbers. By his side was
a revolver containing six empty shells.
Four of 'the cartridges had been exploded
by the heat and the other two bore evi
dence of having come in contact with the
hammer. As the body was burned almost
to a crisp the Coroner was unable to
show conclusively that Hoist had commit
ted suicide.
According to the police, Hoist had been
drinking heavily since the death of his
wife and seemed to be mentally unbal
anced through grief over her demise. On
the night of the fire he was unusually de
spondent and frequently referred to his
sorrow in being separated from his wife
by death. Hoist did not enter the works
until after midnight, which was not In
keeping with his usual custom. He gen
erally retired early and was up as soon
as the sun rose. About an hour after he
had returned to the works a passer-by
heard a pistol shot. A few minutes later
a police officer saw flames issuing from
the glass works.

REGISTERING
OF PHARMACISTS
President Searby Says New
Rule Was Made at the
v June Meeting.
State Board Now Admits
Graduates on College
Diplomas.
"And other States, while this board
holds control,", observed Finper, "will no
longer make California the dumping 1
ground of their ignorant and incompetent
drug clerks, as they have done In the
past." .
"We have demanded back dues from
nobody," said Searby.
"Some men came .here and refused to
pay their back dues," said Finger, "and
we said to them, 'You pay what other
men have paid who were not delinquent
under the old law r.nd we will register
you,' "
In relation to the statement of Mr. Sear
by relative to *he exaction of back dues,
F. H. .Wilson, in whose behalf suifmay
be begun to test the power of the board,
says that three years' back dues were de
manded of him before his registration
would be renewed, although he had not
worked as a pharmacist in the meantime,
and that he holds the receipts of Secre
tary Calvert for the amount.
"This board has tried and is trying to
be fair," Searby went on. "I want to call
your attention to the fact that as a re
sult of the working of pharmacy laws in
this State accidents from ignorance on
the part of pharmacists have been almost
eliminated." .
"We had to exclude none or all, and we
took the course of excluding all."
Good and Bad Schools.
"They will be after August 1."
This, it will be observed, does not ex
actly agree with the statement- made by
Clerk Calvert heretofore. Before the
publication in The Call graduates all un
derstood that they must take the exam
ination. ,
"In the matter of the admission of grad
uates without examination," said Finger
of Santa Barbara, "we had to admit all
or exclude all. There are schoolsâ I will
not say in this State â but there are
schools run for no other purpose than the
making of diplomas. If the board recog
nized credentials from the good schools,
it was put out of its power to keep out
the graduates of diploma mills.
"Then graduates, of tile California Col
lege of Pharmacy will not be required to
take an examination before this board?"
he was asked.
The members of the State Board of
Pharmacy, In session in this city for the
purpose of examining candidates for reg
istration under the State law of 1901, had
â¢every one of them something to say con
cerning the article in yesterday's Call
upon the -board's methods of conducting
its business. For the most part, however.
President Searby was made the spokeman
of the board. "This is not the only board,
nor the only State in which it is exacted
that candidates for registration shall
take an examination," said Mr. Searby.
"The States of New York and Pennsyl
vania and Ohio, as well as many others,
provide that candidates shall be exam
ined before' they are permitted to dis
pense poisons and compound prescrip
tions. Those States accept no credentials.
If I were to go to any one of them my
self, I would have to take an examina
tion before I would be permitted to go
into business.
"I want to say, before I go any farther,
that at the last meeting of this board in
June, the time for the filing of applica
tions upon credentials was extended to
August 1. This was doae for the express
benefit of graduates of the California Col
lege of Pharmacy and of the College of
Physicians and Surgeons, who took their
school examination and received their
diplomas after the date set for the final
applications before this board. We did
this so that there would be no discrimina
tion."
"The present practice of the board, In
this respect, is based, I am informed,
upon an opinion of the Attorney General
that the new law continues the old la_w
in effect. And yet the' new law repeals
the old, and in those portions where it
does not, certain specific reservations of
rights under the old law are made,"
Members of the State Board Talk.
"As The Call has stated, the constltu
tolnallty of the new pharmacy law must
stand the test of the courts," said Attor
ney Frank I. Klngwell yesterday. "My
people are in. this fight to stay. The ac
tion will be commenced just as soon as
the necessary papers can be prepared.
You have heard, I suppose, that the board
has ruled that It will register graduates
of the California College of Pharmacy of
this year's class without examination, on
their credentials. This Is notwithstand
ing the fact that the graduates were giv
en to understand that their credentials
would not bo accepted. Relative to the
payment of back dues, accrued under the
old law, I understand that the board will
accept payment and register the delin
quents who pay up. Nevertheless, In at
least one case where the tender of the
sum duo was made In. my presence, ac
ceptance was refused. Secretary Calvert
stated, at that time, that he had accepted
the back dues from, one applicant and
continued the registration, but that . he
doubted his right to do it, and that my
client must make application for exam
ination. The application was made and
the fee paid, and the man was subse
quently registered anew on his creden
tials. .
