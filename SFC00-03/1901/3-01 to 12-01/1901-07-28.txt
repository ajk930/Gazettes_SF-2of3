These seven were taken when Big Jach
played the drunken soldier. I was going
up "Dupont street .when 1 saw him rolling
down Jackson. He was brown with what
looked like Manila brown and was in real
ity the color that comes Jn boxes. He wore
a broad hat and a swashing blue overcoat
and he had to all appearances a beautiful,
happy jag. He followed the capricious
path that led him to a door a few feet
below Fish alley and there he stopped and
tumbled half way into the entrance.
It was the door of a lottery house. The
lookout was off his guard at the common

the prisoners, it was so easy. He had the
lookout silenced by a blow from a sober

in the hall.

aloud, "Well, how did you leave Manila?"
He was still groping. â¢ . â¢ ,

Barry's favorite role is that of a tramp.
Rlchter, too, has made his fame In that
line. They gained entrance to a gambling
den in that guise. Then, taking advantage
of a commotion made for the purpose,
Barry slipped " vnder the bed, and when
the game was again in full swing pounced
upon the Chinese.
"This subterfuge must never again suc
ceed," they . warned each other solemnly,
and now the first step in a game is to look
under the bed. ' . â¢ Â¦ . <

down smelly passages and a huddling of

never penetrate. But these are few and
even they search each other's eyes anx

ask one another.
And, "In that they have gone so far al
ready, why not farther?" they reply. ..-
For the Fee Guee of Chinatown, the fa
mous Sergeant Conboy, whom, the Chinese
have named the Fat Devil, has a quartet
of officers 1ft his squad that, are playing
euch havoe with the well regulated law
breaking Chinatown that the drowsy op
ium smokers are awake at last with con-
Etemation and the lookouts in the gam
bling' dens shudder at the warnings of
their anxious masters.
"Peace can no longer be found In the
enjoyme&t of ft soothing pipe," sighs the
cmoker. "
"Th* charts* of the gams are marred,"
groans the gambler.
"The time to fraught with danger," com
plains all Chinatown.
And all because this Quartet of Ser
geant Conboy." a Is as perfect a group of
actors as ever played In private off the
stage.
Since the latter part of June, when they
Â¦were put on duty in the Chinese quarter,
they have been offering a continuous per
formance In which they appeared as light
ning change artist*. Officer John Tillman
âBig 1 Jack, you knowâ has presto changed
from a reeling drunk soldier into a door
emashlngr policeman. Jerome Tyrrellâ he's
Jerry â has appeared as the calmest of Ce
lestials one minute and thÂ« fiercest of
law enforcers the next. They have played
the parts of soldiers, of Chinamen, of
tramps, and they say that their roles are
not nearly exhaustedâ In fact, only begun
â and that like other actors they have
many changes of bill In etore. Their cos
tume room proves it.
The continuous performance commenced
â¢when Sergeant Conboy took them, uj>
there a few week* ago. He had Ideas of
his own asvto how this Chinatown busi
ness should be conducted.
"Tou've pot to. flght men with their own
weapons, meet them on their own
ground," he argued.
What is always tho Chinaman's weap
on? ' â¢
lJ Strategy.
Every tlnwu He never resorts to storm.
Arid neither does Sergeant Conboy.
"As long a* these people resort to cun
ning to gain their ends, we have got to
resort to cunning to overcome them," he
argued, and he started his men upon their
campaign of ruse, of play-acting. At the,
end of three weeks they had made half a*
dozen raids upon opium dens, as many
upon fantan games and still as many
upon lottery houses. They had arrested
and caused to be fined 113 Chinese; no one
of them got off for less than $10. The
equad was hated and dreaded and pointed
out in warning from Broadway to Cali
fornia street and from Kearny to Stock
ton streets. !
"Come end see the new devils that you
may know them," said these people when
the squad arrived.
So it came about that all Chinatown,
except the 12.000 who are summering out
of town, M-as on the corner of Washington
and Dupont streets on the day when the
five took up their headquarters there,- and
all Chinatown returned" home with the
features of thosÂ»e five Indelibly Impressed
upon their minds for reference In emer
gency cases.
"The one Is large, like a great moun
tain," they said.
He Is "Big Jack," who made his first
fame as special policeman at the Or
pheum. and Is a combination of serene
pood temper and iron muscle, which Is a
roost excellent combination, especially In
his business.
"Two of them are tall and without flesh,
but strongly knit," they said. "The one
has a powerful arm and the other has a
firm mouth."
"The fourth is little higher than one of
these cut in half, but as broad as the two
halves put together."
They are Tyrrell and Rlchter.

And In spite of the fact that every man,
woman and -Child .within those dozen
blocks took note's on a the personnel of the
squad on the day of their arrival, never
theless they have succeeded in disguising >
themselves â¢ bo cleverly time and . time
again that they have created a panic by
their series of raids. " .
Jerry Tyrrell made himself famous in
the raid at S13^ Washington street. He
was disguised as a Chinaman, and the re
sult was eighteen prisoners marched off
to the Hall of Justice. " V ' ' " i
"You're too tall fqr a Chinaman; you're
too tall by far. Jerry." said Barry.
"And haven't you ever seen a tall Chi
naman?" put in the sergeant, who would
listen to no croaking.. â¢ . - * - '.;; -.."
"Your nose is too big." objected Till
man, who perhaps envies Tyrrell's Roman
profile.
"And what's the Reason that noses can't
grow big in the -climate of China?"-cried
the sergeant! '
Tyrrell's nose, however, was a draw
back. Ccnboy afterward told some one
of the make-up in this wise:
"We greased him and we painted him
end we tailed him; we put him into a
smock and a" skull cap and cork-soled
shoes; and if it hadn't been for the nose
of him he'd have got past the second door
without a murmur.
"But his nose is too big. If he'd had one
of those hlt-in noses like a Chinaman,
he'd have been all right. I asked one of
the prisoners afterward how â¢ they knew
him, and he says to me. 'Nosey too big,'
says he, and he hooked his fingers like
that to show me."
Even so, Tyrrell did Immensely clever
Work. His makeup was as perfect as it
could be; his lace was carefully painted
*to the right color, his .eyes were nar
rowed, his costume was correct.
He sauntered down Washington street
with his shoulders high, his feet shuf
fling. At S19VÂ£ he turned In casually. It
was S:30 o'clock. . Lights- and shadows
were baffling. Nobody noticed him.
The lookout had no suspicions. He sj^f
a big Chinaman coming to the game, tnat
was all. The big Chinaman dropped In.
The lookout had merely given a glance
through the wicket This was evidently a
friend. All was well.
So ,past the first door.
Up the dark passage Tyrrell shuffled,
and no alarm was given.
At the second door he" already felt him
self successful. As he reached it, though,
a strong light struck his face.
The guard gave him a sharp glance and
halted in the act of letting him in. The
face looks strange, was his quick thought.
Without comprehending the 'Â¦ ruse he
sniffed trouble In the air.
On the instant he gave his warning.
There was a sound of confusion Inside.
Tyrrell took In the | situation/ He threw
the guard aside and wrenched bis way In.
There were the Chinamen. There, on
the table, lay the evidence. It was beans,
but it was evidence.
The big man let his cap fall, he cast off
his role. "With a sweep of his arm he
had the cowering, whimpering, chattering
law-breakers covered with his revolver.
One of them made an attempt to throw
the evidence away, but Tyrrell warded
off the attempt. Â¦ â¢
He had already given his signal. The
rest of the squad broke in.' : ..
On the way to the prison with the eight
een men arrested, even the sergeant grot
mixed up. now and then. "Stand back,
there!" he shouted to his own officer. â¢'.
And the elevator man who takes Tyrrell
up and down, to and from the prison ev
ery day, also cried: "Stand back, there!"
when he moved away from the prisoners.
When I asked him. if he didn't 'risk his
life In the act of breaking in he disclaimed
any. bravery. They all. do that. I don't
know whether, there Is risk or. not. "* They
claim that the Chinese never draw a
weapon on an officer. .. -â¢Â¦....

TlUman said. "They don't know whether

unless it.be the result of environment, and
the more energetic temperament invidious
Â¦to 3. colder cliniate.
Members of women's/clubs bring upon
themselves ridvcule by ,Jthe extremes to
Â¦which they carry their prejudices. Think
of a club seeking to taboo the eating of
icecream on Sunday, as in a New Jersey
town, while in another the spinsters were
harrowed in their feelinps by the sight of
the village beaus and belles walking to
church together and casting loverlike
glances, for which they wished to indict
naughty Cupid for such awful misde
meanor.
In Brooklyn, where many of the hand- Â¦
some homes have beautiful window jardi
nieres, one clubite ' unfortunately passed
just as a small flower pot fell from the
window above. She was not hurt, and a
servant soon removed the stains from her
clothing. But Miss; or Mrs. Club could
not - forgive *the offending flower pot, so
the club sifters held an indignation meet
ing, wherein a resolution was passed de
nouncing window gardens and framing a
petition to the. powers that be to the ef
fect that an ordinance be issued abolish
ing the beautiful window plants; -
And-so it is. The club woman devoted'
to club life becomes too aggressive.
In her nervous enthusiasm she springs
something startling and hysterical on the
public, and were _the country . governed"
by the graduates of these organizations
it -would result in a war of factions more
nerve-racking and peace-destroying than
history has yet recorded.
Let' the/men steer the bark of statecraft
while the woman rules the home. There
is where -in" childhood the men , of the fu
ture, learn the best and noblest' lessons
from the loving mother, > and assuredly
not from the habitues of women's clubs.
KATE THYSON MARK.
DOES CLUB LIFE UNFIT A WOMAN FOR
HOME LIFE?
. Â£""T\HIS clamcr against thÂ« cjub woman
I ,â this. complaint that woman's club
: I life is unfitting?' her for home life-^ii.
, J^ all seems eo absurd to one who reai
â¢.'Â¦ ; ly knows dub life as it is.
It is easy enough for any one outside of
clubs to theorize about them- "VVe can-al
ways work ourselves into a fright over
any imaginary danger. . In the end the
danger usually disappears, or is found to
be of small account after all.- So with
club'life. People to whom it is still little
known, by whom it is not understood,
have set themselves to argue on how un
fortunate it would be if woman should be
come so engrossed in club life that she
could neglect the best thing she hasâ ,
which is her home. Thinking about! It,
still theorizing, they, have come to say
that the dreaded thing has happened,
that she is already neglecting her home. -
Look over the club women you know.
Do you find them leaving neglected chil
dren and husbands at home while they go
to a- club meeting? If any of them do
would they not have done the same thing
if they had never seen a club and if. they,
: were going to shop or to attend the the
ater instead? : 'Â¦' ; . -- -
I will' tell you what I know of club
women. I know .them as strong, tender
mothers, as loyal and de-vAed wives; ' I
know them as the best wive3 and mothers
there are, taken as a class, because they
/are the best trained women.
For there is no question about the
training that, club life is to a woman." The
keynote of club life is, broadening. There
in lies the secret of its benefit.-
Woman's life as it has been in -the past
has been of a nature to "hinder this pro
cess." We were not less capable than
men or less ambitious, but we were
obliged to be narrow. Women of the past
spent most of their lives 'within four
walls. . An article in the July Atlantic
Monthly gives a good idea of the New
England woman's life in early years, and
that will stand very well as a type for
woman in general. She "looked well to
the ways of the household,"/ as she
thought. In reality was she doing, that?
She was staying at home all : day. long.
She was caring for her family in material
ways. But mentally â what : did she have
to -give them? Â¦ > Â¦ > - ':
Chopping wood, cleaning cupboards,
baking breadâ this was the daily round,
from' sunup to sundown. Was this, in
the compietest sense, "looking well to the
ways of the household?" j
It certainly was, according to . the best
of that woman's belief. But now that the
world is growing older it is learning more. .
We have come to believe that cleaning;
and baking and nursing are not all a,
i/homemakfr's duties.
When the husband of the past day cams:
home, -(what had his wife to offer, him?
What^but ;. those, .material^ . thlmjs,., which u
; were tlie, result of her Say's labor? Had
she refreshment for his mind, in tactful
and intelligent conversation? No, for tha
poor thing had nothing to, talk about, j
"The yeast didn't rise well to-day."
\ ".The baby broke his rattle." ,\ .
, These and such as these were the items,
of news which she had to offer. After
they were delivered conversation lagged. '.
Now what is the difference between this â¢
type of the past and the so-called "new"
club woman of to-day?
The woman who attends , a club is
broadened. Let me repeat, that is tha
keynote. She comes in contact with other
women; she sees other points of view
than her own, from which she has been
looking at the world , for so many years.
She discusses with others the questions
which she used to face alone, trying to
work out their solution by herself. This
.was? a slow and a painful and too often
an unsuccessful process.'
Now see how "directly her home life Is
the gainer by the 'new process. First, in
the rearing of children. In old days it
wasVthe custom to bring up children
without any idea, as now, of the matter
being a science, I may almost say a fine
art. As a result, both parents and chil
dren suffered.
Nowadays we are learning far moire
about young minds, their tendencies, their
training-. They are little gardens for the
mother, the gardener, to plant and to
nourish. Does a gardener succeed best
by working entirely alone, attempting to
rear- his plants without regard to the ex
perience and knowledge of any gardener
but himself? No. Gardeners know that
by ' comparing notes they may improve ,
their results, for the experience of the ,
many is greater than the experience of
the one. / , . ."
Again, in matters pertaining to the
home beautiful. Discussion helps. In
some clubs house decoration is made a
matter of study. How much lovelier,
then, must the homes of these women be,
these women who have spent some time
and' thought together over the ways of
making their homes .more beautiful for
the. enjoyment of the" husband and chil
dren who share them. Â¦
In all other matters relating to the bet
tering of homes . women are constantly
learning as a result of club life. Contact,
discussion, the comparing of notesâ these
are .the means of the learning.
To be sure there are other thmgs studied
in clubs. Social science, literature,, artâ
and you may say that these have no'use in
the home life. Bub- have they not? Most
men knowsomething of them, do they not?
Arid why. should they not be able to talk
them over at home? Why -should they
seek other men always for' conversation
relating to these broader topics? If a wife "
can \ offer interest and understanding in
such matters, will not the home be more
complete, and therefore will not the hus
band enjoy, his time spent' in it far more
than formerly?
I heard , a man , say the â¢ other day that
woman is progressing so fast In education
that it will not : be long before she out
strips man in the race. , I believe that as
she > progresses men â¢ will come to admire
her trained mind more and more, and that
thev will seek educated women. This .
means club women, for they are the ones
who study. '":Â¦ :Â¦ . \
As 'for the "complaints that are repeat
edly being made that club life causes
wrangling, I want to say that I believe .
them to be baseless. Women of true rs
finement do not -.wrangle," and j refinement
is the thins cultivated by club life.
Again) it is often said that club ,women
have no time for, home.- I do not know of
any who .stay away from their ' homes on
account of their clubs. They would prob
ably j be calling . if ; thqty.; -were not meeting
their friends in another .
Women /arenbrighter, "and sunnier and
better hbmemakers. I firmly : believe, be
cause of- the contact with others that club'
life ffiveV them.' r .\'\\ -â¢â¢â¢Â¦'Â¦,

NO! SAYS
THE GIBSON GIRL.
2Salzburg, Austria, now puts in a claim
for the record birth rate of a single fam
ily.. Johann' Stelner. a farmer, married
Ills wife, " Martha, nineteen years ago,
when he was 52 and she was 23. In the
â nineteen years since they have had thirty
seven childrenâ triplets three times and
twins twelve times, while the babies ha va
come along singly four times. Of the"
children thirty-four are living and they
ore all healthy and normal. -The thirty
seventh child was born a coupfo of weeks
ago. on the day on which the father cele
* bTated his seventy -second birthday. ThÂ«
mother is stiH in robust health. Who
knowsiof a record to beat this?â New Torfc
Press.
that nai Â«Jl the otners wovmr nave Jump
ed on him In an instant. The cashier of
the party knew Just how many dollars
and cents were due to each man and he
counted the money out slowly and care
fully, giving to each his exact due. When
tho pay car ramo back, past the quarry
an hour and a quarter later he was still
counting the coin,, piling It up In little
stacks, while thÂ« 'men to whom It be
longed watched eagerly and intently,
awaiting his signal that the Job was flnÂ«
Iwhed. â¢' .
The system of paying as observed In
thin car Is so complete that If a man
claims, not to havo received his pay for
last December,* for example, the paymas
ter can tell him In an Instant who the
man wna immediately in front of him in
line, who was next behind him nnd who
every man was In that line,' in the gang
In which he belonged. He can also tell
him the exact amount of money paid to^
him, nm well as to every other man In
his gang, and can further prove. by the
man In front of him and behind him that
he was there and that he got his money.
That's why the paymaster never. takes a
receipt. The mystic numbers, called . out
by the pay roll clerk, are the key to this
system, but Just 'how these' numbers "are
applied Mr. Robinson doesn't really care
to malce public.
The great work camps of the company
on the new line are populated densely and
a more cosmopolitan community than
gome, them it would: be hard to find.
Wherever it is possible to get them white
men are. employed, but .for some , of â the
work Mexicans and ' Japanese ; are hired
as well as Chinese for camp cooks
and laundrymen. ' : Although the f orelgii
element is largely represented, there is
little or no thieving or other lawlessness
in , these camps, for the majority of . the
icnow, to T.ave tnings done in too mctnod
ical a way with a pay train. It may run^
over half a division, pay all the men that
far and then skip, all the rest until another
day, or. perhaps two or three days. The
men know this and never reckon upon
their coin until they see the car stop.
I watched the work of the pay crew all
that day and the day following. Their
system of work was perfect. No disputes,
no claims made by workmen of shortage
In amounts, no attempts to get something
that belonged to some one else, for every
old employe of the road knows that Mr.
Robinson makes no mistakes, or If hÂ» has
ever made any they are so few and have
been eo quickly detected that It doesn't
pay to try to take, advnntape of them.
"I noticed that one man claimed some
thing due him from last month." said I.
when the till was eloped nnd the special
pulled out of a Fmnll station.
"Ytr," replied the paymaster, "we have
n great lot of savings bank accounts In
this car. We have money here for six
months or a yenr. belonging to employes
who leave it with me from month to
month rather than 'draw and spend It.
Some of these men hnve large eums 1 to
their credit. Some of them draw a full
month once In Â« while and It Is fcufndent
to supply their needs for several month*.
They nllow their money to sland to their
credit until they have a Rood round sum.
Most of them are careful, provident men
and use the pay car as a safe deposit
box. When wo get to the rock crusher
down here, where the big camp is, you
will see how tile Rusalan laborers havo
caved their money."
All the ballast for the new coast line
!s crushed stone. It is all made at he
company's crushers, near Gaviota. These
quarries are* operated by Russians and
Poles. ." When, the car stopped In a deep
cut near the crusher a young Russian
who spoke fair English entered, the car
and asked for the money. due v cleven men.
He gave the names correctly, and each
name was checked off. The total due
them, covering several months In some
cases, amounted to a very large sum and
when the gold twenties, with additional
large stacks of silver dollars and halves,
.were handed out the young man's large
sombrero was filled to the brim with coin;
Just beyond the barbed wire fence a group
of Russians awaited '.him. Not one . of
them attempted to Interfere with -.the
money, for"* If one hsd put a hand ; Into
employes are long In the service of thÂ«
company and will not tolerate such prac
tices. A thief in a railroad camp Is cerÂ»
tain to meet very severe treatment when
his peculations are discovered. Dishon
esty is at a~dlscount In Southern Paciflo
camps, and It is rarely indeed that steal-
Ing is reported.
The pay car stops anywhere* Wherever
there Is a gang of men at work on thÂ«
roadbed Paymaster Robinson opens up
his little offlce and in less tlma than It
takes to tell "it the workmen have r.?
celved their shining coin and thÂ» special
Is gone. Sometimes, particularly on tnÂ»
new line of road, stops were made -for
Isolated Individuals : who had been
assigned to complete some specific work,
or for a solitary track walker whos*
lonely vigil was seldom interrupted, i&ts
by the advent of the pay car. Now and!
then at a country siding a passenger or
freight train stopped and the pay car
opened up for business. 'Not two minutes*
time Is required to pay off a train crew'
*and the accommodating spirit of the pay- ,
master Is appreciated by .these men, who
otherwise might have to wait an Indefin
ite time to catch the pay car at a station I
wher* their own trains also stopped. la
one instance, near Gaviota, a bridge in- 1
speetor was tightening: some bolts on thÂ« :
great viaduct when the- pay car hove la j
sight, j He made no signal to stop the rpÂ«- I
dal, but the engineer had his Instructions 'â¢
and the car stopped in the. middle of the,
structure. ThÂ«- Inspector received, his) ;
money and the tram was off In Just fif
teen seconds by the watch. A day or two |
later we were running down a steepgrada J
In the Santa Crua Mountains. ThÂ« BpÂ«-i
dal slowed up and stopped. There was '
a telegraph lineman astride thÂ» crossarm
of a telegraph pole, 'and by the time hÂ»
reached the ground Mr. Ruthrauff had
found his entry in the payroll books. tnÂ»
coin was, counted out ready for him and
Mr. Lineman had his money before ha
had time to begin gossip about th.*
weather and crops. ,
Tha opportunity afforded by the pay
car for character study Is simply unlim
ited. "When we stop up here at the next
station," said Mr. Robinson, "you will
nee the agent coma aboard. He 1Â» an old
man and has been here for many years.
His name? I don't remember many
Dames: its faces I know. This old fallow
will get his left hand: hooked down ready
to rake his money off thÂ» counter thÂ«
instant be comes in at the door. If hÂ«
didn't do that Td know at a glance that
lie wasn't the man who belonged here,
Tle'll grin from ear to ear as soon as
you can nee his face and hell swtpe that
coin off the board with his right hand
Into his left In' one sweep. Then he'll
dlvido the pile, giving each hand some
thing to carry. When he gets outside
he'll, put the silver In one pocket, bite
each gold coin and put them Into the fob
pocket inhis trousers. Be lives on tha
silver and saves ths gold. I suppose. New
â¢watch him."
With a precision that could only com*
from long practice the old station agent
went through every detail of thÂ» perform
ance Just s.9 Mr. Robinson Bad said, ha
would and the last I saw of him as ths
train pulled but he was Jamming gold tens
Into the little watch . pocket, one at a
time, after first carefully testing them
In his teetb to be sure that they were gen
_ There- is the careful man who wants to
be sure that the paymaster know* him
and Is In -no "danger Of 'mistaking' him for
some other person of the qarae cams.
.There Is the' fresh young man with a red
tie at a way station, who imagines be Is
funny s and that the pay crew look for
ward with great pleasure to their month
ly visit to his station. There la the man
who Is always late and who misses
pay car when It is on his own division
r.nd catches it on another, only to add
his trifle to the vicissitudes and cares of
the clerks. " There is the burly, honest
pectlon boss, who wants Mr. Robinson to
be entirely satisfied that he Is paying the
men who are entitled to the coin, and
there Is the "voucher fiend," "who has
shaved the pay warrants of Tom. Dick
and Harry at usurious rates and who ap
proashes the pay car In deadly fear that
some one may have garnlsheed the
money that is coming on his vouchers.
AH sorts and conditions of men present
themselves at the pay-car window. In
earlier days, when the system was newer
ond-Iess perfect, every possible sort of
scheme was devised to beat the paymas
ter.- They all failed, however, and to-day
nothing. of the sort Is tried.
â¢ There Is another car attached to the
pay car, which, while it plays no part
in the business of this department. Is
nevertheless important- It is a tourist
car and. carries from two to four passen
gers. They are all stocklly built men,
with grizzled mustaches and sharp gray
eyes^" Their ccats have a suspicious bulge
cn the side iiand if there ever happens to
be a little 'matinee on a lonely section
with bandits these gentlemen will play
a' conspicuous part. This is the guards'

proficiency In certain lines ', peculiarly

years), this little special with Its valuable
cargo speeds over the Southern Paclflo
rails from San Francisco to El Fnso. Its
Kchtdule Is known to no one and It never
travels in the night. Its one greatest ele
ment of safety lies In the fact that every

In that pay car and when it pulls Into a
town from the 'east, or west at nightfall
and remains at the depot all night every
one of the hundred or more employes
in the .night yards feels that It la to hta

Trho were dlsr<c&ed of at the rate of not

This seen* transpires in â¢ the Southern
Pacific pay ear almost every hcur of*
every day !n the year. While the expe
riences of the paymaster and his assist
ants must of necessity become fearfully
monotonous to themselves, nevertheless
the pay car presents inexhaustible oppor
tunities for the study of human nature,
to the one trho makes an occasional trip
over the road ts the guest of Paymaster
C. J. Robinson.
I had been Invited to make a trip In the
car through the courtesy of General Pr.3-
Fenger, w Agcnt Goodman And Treasurer
Smith. - and -was tcld that the special
would leave the Ban Francisco depot en
route south over the new coast line at n
certain hour and minute. I was also told
that the special always left at exactly
the time scheduled, although not one. man
outside the pay car crew ever knew what
its schedule la. when it will start or where
It will go. This Is a part of the system.
Ae I was unable to leave at the hour des
ignated It occurred to me that it would
be & simple matter to take the limited an
hour later and overtake the special a few
miles down the road, particularly as the
pay car stops at every station, as well an
between station*, wherever there Is a man
cr a rang of men to pay. I found, how
ever, that that pay car 5s about the hard
est thing on the rails to locate or to over
take. Not only did It make all the stops
and pay all the men from San Francisco
to Ban X>uls Oblspo, but it made such time
between stops that we never got within
ten miles of It all day. At dusk that
night when the regular train pulled Into
San LÂ»uls Oblspo the pay car stood on n
elding In front of the depot and dinner
was served.
Few outsiders have erÂ»r seen the lns!de
of this car. For obvious reasons It is not
deemed best by the officials to have it t<v>
well known, and while I am permitted to
plve a general description of it, yet there
ere some details of Its Interior mechanism,
constructed for special purposes in case
of need, about which nothing can be said.
The front end t*t the car contains thÂ«
kitchen and dining-room, the latter n
large, elry apartment, the full width ol
thÂ» car and about twelve feet In length.
From this room a narrow passage, closed
by heavy steel plated doors, self-lockir.;?,
lends to the middle compartment, where
there *re four full sections, arranged and
furnished exactly as in a first-class
standard Pullman. This Is the livirg and
rl^eplng-room of the paymaster and his as
Fl'tanf*. A heavy partition of Â«v\k. lined
with sheet steel, separates this room
from the office, which 1? also the arsenal.
The office is about SxlO feet in size and
sousre Inch of room Is - ntlllrsd.
The .walls are all of oaV, InterM-ied with
fheet steel, and p. 11 the windows are
heavily barred. In the center of the
rear wall is the paymaster's window. A
flidlng dsor which operates autom3tlcal
ly end which can be Instantly closed
with sufficient f^rce *o take off a man's
erms as clesn as a elÂ«Â»avÂ»r. affords con
stant protection to the funds In charÂ«re
of the paymaster, and In addition to this
safeguard there are also other devices, a
description cf Â¦which is forbidden. There
are two narrow passageways leading to
the rear . steps. A cross passage. Just
large enough to admit one person at a
time. connects those two. passing: direct
ly in front, of the little window. A line
of men may enter nt one side of the car,
pass before the window cÂ»;e at a time
and emerge from the other sic!e. but all
the time they are in such position as to
be covered by the guards of the paycar.
On either side of the rear wall of the of
fice are loop holes covered Â¦with steel lids.
These holes are Just large enoueh to ad
mit the muzzle of a eawed-off shotgun or
a Winchester. On the desk, immediately
â¢under these loopholes, lies a heavy Colt's
eix-shooter, fully loaded and ready for In
stant use, and there are men In that car
who know how to use them with deadly
Â¦ effect. On the offlce wall, within arm's
length of the loopholes, is- the gunrack,
with a dozen Winchesters and shotguns.
The paycar has never been attacked,
much less robbed, and if such an at
tempt is ever made it Â¦will result dis
astrously to the robbers. Even they
rucceed In capturing the car they won't
fret the money, for the money simply
won't be- Jhere â but that's one of the se
erets Mr. Robinson doesn't want made
public.
â¢The system of paying our employe's
In coin Instead of by check as some other
roads do," caJd Mr. Rofclnson. "has been
found to bÂ« more satisfactory all around
than the ether plan. Since the war rev
enue Btamp has been required on checks
the cost of revenue stamps alone, should
we pay our thousands cf employes by
check, would perhaps more than equal
the entire cost of the present rystem. not
to mention the clerical expense of pre
paring the checks and the cost of dis
tributing them to the employes. Again,
when a worfcSnermnn out on a country
division gets a check It Is a matter of
furious inconvenience to him sometimes
to get Itcarhed and he appreciates the
nctual coin In his own hands for this ad
ditional reason.
"At the right of the offlce you will note
the counter where the checking and call
ing clerks sit. Mr. Ruthrauff has charge
of the payrolls, which you v.1ll note arts
In bound books, each month by Itself. Mr.
Taylor, who checks all payments, enters
In his books the amount of money I pay
out to each man, and In addition the two
r-umben that always follow .the naming
of a sum of money by Mr. Ruthrauff when
an employe appears at the window. The
eystcm appears complex to any one who
stands here and listens to what we cay.
yet it Is simple and absolutely perfect so
far as identification goes, unless it is a
perfectly new man, whom we have never
had in the car before. In such cases the
foreman of each section gang stands "in
that little niche in the passageway there
and Identifies the man. When a regular
employe appears at the -window he gives
his name, Mr. Ruthrauff Instantly finds,
his entry on the payroll, calls off the
amount due himâ for example, $53 57â and
as eoon as I hear this sum called my right
hand drcps two twenties, a ten, a five;' my
left hand has already done Its work, and -
there Is a fifty-cent piece and a nickel on
the rubber mat. The sum\ being 57 cents.

I Barrington. '.however, a prey, to remorse
and wretchedness, gradually loses interest
in his domestic relations, and In a fu
tile search for. happiness, changes from
an ideal -lover and husband into a low
order Bohemian, seeking amusement and
solace in the society of Gemma, an un
conventional and charming little model,
for whom he daily and nightly neglects
Dorothy. 'The final climax Is reached
when Dorothy discovers a newspaper clip
ping, telling of the 'death of his first wife
a year, previous. After 'a -passionate ap

has now no intention of marrying her, and
feeling that life henceforth can hold noth

In "The Way of a Man With a Maid."
by France's Gordon Fane, the scene is laid
in New York, where- Dorothy Tremaine, a
beautiful young artist, falls in love and
marries John Barrlngton. a young English
author, who fraudulently obtains a di
vorce from his first wife that he may win
her. I Dorothy, believing the divorce, to be
legal, lives- with him for more than a
year, when, on a', visit to Paris, she en
counters the deserted- wife, now a hopeless
invalid, who. burning with jealous rage,
denounces Dorothy, and divulges to her
the true: state of affairs.
But Dorothy, in her exalted attachment,
believing that love sanctifies the relations
existing between them, does not ' leave

promise, that when \he is free he will
marry her. remains to the end the tender

LEIGH, H. IRVINE Is already well known In this *fetate as a man of letters",
through Ms works on social problems and also as a' writer for the dally
press. Mr. Irvine has Just published another book, Affair In the South
Seas," a story of romantic adventure on one of the South Sea Islands.
Questions In sociology appeal to a limited audience, but , this last book by Mr.
Irvine has- the world for its readers. Â¦ It is entitled to a high degree of popular-'
Ity. The author has evidently made a long and personal study of these South
Sea countries and their peoples, for his book affords a charming opportunity of
acquiring information and at the same time entertainment as a capital story of
adventure ashore and afloat. *
Mr. Irvine is a graduate of the State University at Columbia, Mo., and has
also had the advantage of a legal education. For three yea'rs'he and Frank P.
Blair wooed the fickle goddess of law at Kansas City. Irvine had already done
some newspaper work in different cities of the Kast.'and during that time made
a personal friend of . Eugene Field. Field advised him to devote his best efforts
to work outside of the newspaper offices, so In 1886 he wrote "The Problem of J
Distressed Labor." .
It was in 1887 that he came to San. Francisco and began work on the dally
papers here, while at the same time he put in all his spare moments on his
second bookâ a series of essays on social, questions called "The Struggle for
Bread." It had the distinction of requiring four editions. In 1S93 he went to the
Islands and spent many months in traveling and. writing stories and sketches.
This last book, "An Affair in the South Seas," tells of the life of a colony on
the South Sea island Atollia. The discussions on the, political and social forma
tion of this small state are. Interesting and contain many points that offer food
for thought, but this is not. the real charm of the bookâ at least not for the gen
eral reader. You feel too fascinated by the descriptions of the wondrous couiv
try.' where everything grows wild for the support of man; you are too keen in
following the customs of the picturesque and superstitious natives; you find far/
too great an interest in the concrete life itself to pay 'more- than passing tribute'
to the abstract . theories of government that arise. 'Mr. Irvine has evidently ap
preciated this fact and has cut down all sociological discussion to a minimumâ
he gives just enough of it to make the story consistent. , '
This colony that sets out from the United Slates to make a home on a far-,
away tropical isle is the scheme of Captain Swanson, an old: sea captain who
has made a fortune and now proposes to spend it in trying a philanthropical idea.
Thfe voyage of many weeks on a sailing vessel is not made without many ad
ventures. The author gives their sea experiences in>good swinging style. His de
scription of the storm and attack by pirates has the ring of Cooper. â¢
. The natives give the prospective home bujlders hearty greeting, and as Swan
son speaks their language all goes well. The ship is sent back to America for
more supplies and the colonists go to home building. . Their, pleasant" round of
daily life and the step by step progress made toward an ideal community in an
ideal spot will/make any reader envy these people; for the scenes that Mr.' Ir : J
vine depicts are to be duplicated inireallty in these. distant fairyllke Islands. He
certainly deserves credit that he can draw his pictures with so'sure a hand/ .
The tragic element Is Introduced in the character of Bill- Banks; beachcomber.
This man, through a few feats' of sleight of hand and ventriloquism so works
on the superstitious savages that they- take; his word for law and are begin
nins to look.upon the colonists with suspicious eyes. Swanson is equal to the
occasion and arranges an incantation scene In the depths of , the forest that out-/
rivals anything that Banks ever could attempt. He so: wins over the natives
that they make an example of the beachcomber.
This realistic bit of tragedy sets out the more strongly the Idyllic passages
that have preceded it. ,,â¢ : ' Â¦ ' '. : .
In thjs book Mr. Irvine' shows great versatility. It is said that- he is soon
to publish another novelâ a romance of Hawaii' called "The .Old Editor."

I was 3 years old when my family left

During my boyhood I made two visits to
the capital, one when i was 7, the other

strong now, I was small and sickly at that
age. I had my first schooling at the Col

Literary Notes.
The verses of Lilian H. Shuey that have
appeared in various periodicals of the
United ' States have been gathered to
gether and published in dainty form un
der the title "Among the Redwoods."
The collection should be prized by Call
fornlans on account of the author's evi
dent appreciation of the natural beauties
of the State. The verses all have a pleas
ing metrical swing and best of all ring
so true of the beautiful scenes: and life
amons the redwoods. This little book will
make a pleasant souvenir for Eastern
cousins. (Published by the Whltake.r &
Ray Company, San Francisco. In paper,

"The Transfiguration of Mlssi Pbilura"
Is a novelette by Florence Morse Kings
ley. This sprightly little story is woven
round the "New Thought," which is find
ing expression in Christian Science, Divine
Healing, etc. In the course of the story
Miss Philura makes drafts upon the All-
Encircling Good] for a husband and vari
ous other things, and the All-Encircling
Good does not disappoint her. Some who
have seen the story have said it is a
satire. Others are sure It is not. but that
the author deals In a frftndly and sincere
way with .the belief which supplies the
motif of her story. The first class find
amusement, at least. In the adventures
of the demure little heroine. Â¦ The second
class see in them also an acceptable illus
tration of the practical workings of. their
belief. (Published by Funk & Wagnalls

Although Selma Lagerlof's masterpiece,
In 'Â¦' the opinion of her countrymen, Is
"Gosta 'Berllngs Saga," her more general
reputation as the best exponent of the
"new mysticism" Jn Sweden rests upon
her short stories rather than upon her so
called novel. In this long work of fiction
the reader'* interi.Mt flags, owing to the
fact that the chapters are not thoroughly
welded together. But the short stories
hold the attention from beginning to end.
Thlf: Is particularly true of the young
writer's latest volume, "From a Swedish
Homestead" (McClure, Phillips & Co.) In
this collection of short stories, which Jes
sie Brochner has rendered Into English so
charmingly, there is a wide range of sub
jects, from Icelandic saga to biographies
of the saints. .The volume contains a
number of sketches of modem Swedish

From a Swedish Homestead.
Herein lira a radical difference between
the two translations. Sewall arranged
his fourteen-line poems in blank vers*.
maintaining that in that form he could
adhere to a more literal translation. Tay
lor rhymes carefully according to the
abba-abba scheme followed in the
original, ,
Whether, he gains or loses the poet's
spontaneous ardor is a matter of taste.
It is interesting to compare tho two trans
lations in one of their tropical pictures.

Long ages from the time when Chaos was.
The fire in torrents spouted from this mouth:

The lava, stiffening, leaves It In repose.
And yet, last effort of the ancient flame
Around the crater's. rim forever chilled.
Flashing acroes the pulverized recks.
Like clap of thunder in the silence's midst,,
Powdered .with gold by their own pollen shed.

' Taylor's form, is this:

The soil has found inviolate repose.

"In"' Search of Mademoiselle," by George
Glbbs, Is a rattling historical novel, well
above the average. Mr.' Gibb3 Is a clever
artist as well as. a writer; in. fact, the Il
lustrations In the book are all his own.
Perhaps it is this artistic sense that gives
him such eloquent powers of description
and accounts for his presenting his char
acters in such picturesciue lights. Even
his villain is a devil that attracts atten
tion for his points of physical beauty.
This De Bacan is a Spaniard who would
have been an adornment as an Inquisitor
at any inquisition party of the ancient
clays. and a" man with whom none other
than the hero could cope. Kllllgrew, that
Mr. Glbbs sets against this doughty don,
Is a giant Englishman and; a foeman
worthy of his steel.
Mademoiselle, who figures as the hero
ine, Is interesting in a quiet way, but It
Is in painting men and braye deeds that
the author is at his best. She wins the
heart of Kllligrew, of De Bacan and then
of an Indian called Olotoraca. Every one
who sees her falls in love, and that gives
the motif of the story. Kllllgrew meets
her first when he saves her from De Ba
can on a captured Spanish ahlp, and with
him it is love ht first sight. Their lives
ppern thrown together, and later they find
themselves on the same ship bound for
the wilds of America. The Spaniards
massacre the French, colonists,' and Made
moiselle Is lost felght of until near the end
of the story,, when the gallant Killigrew
finally finds her in an Indian village, pro
tected by the young chief Olotoraca.
Do , Bacan and Kllligrew are enemies
from the first page, and both wish to win
Mademoiselle. The lady hates the Span
iard,' but he has made 'up his mind to
have' her love him whether or no. Both
these men are giants among. men and ex
pert In the uee of arms. They meet many
.times through the story, -and in the de-.
ecrlption of these encounters the author
Is at his best. The book is published by

I saw his object. He sought to unsteady my

"Mademoiselle is in the hands of her friends,
senor. Come now! Enough! You have your,

I threw oft my morion to keep my brow cool.

he leaped for me, engaging with such incom
parable swiftness that I broke ground and gave
back- ten â twenty â paces under his fierce as
sault. But we fought on, our. eyes looking Into
each other's, glittering and more piercing even
than the swords we wielded. Shouting was
now most plainly to be heard the direction,
from which we had come. I heard Job God

journey, for I heeded only that at the end of
it lay Parts. I. reached the " city one day
, at Fundown, and entered without a passport
fit the' St.' Denis gate, the warders being hardly
fo strict as Mayehne supposed. I was dusty,
footsore and hungry, in no guise to present
myself before Monsieur; wherefore I went no
farther that night -than the inn of the Amour
de D!?u. in the Rue des Coupejarrets. :
Far below my garret window lay the street â
a trench between the high, houses. Scarce eight
feet off loomed the dark wall of the house
opposite. To me, fresh from the wide woods
of St. Quent'n, it seemed the de?lre of Par!3
folk to outhuddie in closeness the rabbits in
a warren. So ingenious were they at con
triving to waste no inch of open apace that
the houses, standing at the 'base but a scant
street's width apart, ever Jutted out farther
at each story , till they looked to" be fairly
toppling together. I could see into the win
dows up and down the way; see the people
moving about within; hear opposite neighbors
call to each other. But across from my aery
were no lights and no people, for that house'
was shuttered tight from attic to "cellar, its
dark front as expressionless as a blind face.
I marveled how it came to stand empty * In
that teeming quarter.
Too tired, however,' to wonder long, I blew
out the candle and was asleep before 'I could
thut my, eyes.

Henry of Navarre was bombarding Paris.

nolee was thunder. . . â¢ '
From the window I peered into floods of rain.
The peals died away. Suddenly came a ter
rific lightning flash, and I cried out in aston
ishment. For the shutter cpposlte was open,
and I had a vivid vision of three . men in the
window. Â®*eK3
Then all was dark again, and the thunder
shook the roof.
I stood straining my eyes Into the night,
waiting for thÂ« next flash. When It came it
showed me the window barred as. before.
Flash followed flash; I winked the rain, from
my eyes and peered In vain. -The shutter re
mained closed as if It had never been opened.

as she thought of him. It may have been
that Â«there swept across her a fore
shadowing of what the future held in
store.
The gift of a dog, even of one so very
valuable as Nero, ought, not result 'n
crime; yet this simple, transaction, willful
on the part of the dog. purely whimsical
with the girl, and to a large extent cheer
ful on the part of Antone, lÂ«d up to a
murder which startled the community
and developed one of the most remarkable
trials in the history of crime in California.
Not more than three months after the
incident at the Mission el Carmelo, Dolo
res Aguirre and Robert Blair were made
husband and wife. Â¦" ', Â¦
Thereafter for nearly six months in the
year Blair's duties as mining .engineer
took' him away from home, and as his
trips were^generally in the roughest por
tions of the mining districts the wife was
left much to herself. â
The pair were settled comfortably in one
of the less fashionable sections of Oakr'
land and after three year's two children
had come, to occupy the time and add to
the cares of the young mother. . . '
Nero was her constant companion and
the children were his especial care. Hap
piness, as happiness goes, certainly found
a niche here and. undisturbed, remained.'
After a time, however, strange' storios
reached \ the ears of . Mrs. j Blair, and - one
day a lady, elegantly dressed, alighted
from a carriage at her door "and brought 1
misery in her train. ' * Â¦ .
Her visit was at once an accusation, a
condemnation j and a , curse. ; JjjHefly, Blair
was not Blair; he was ifct a mining engi
neer; he did not spend six months of the
year in the mining districts. . j
He was Robert Thorpe; had jbeen. for
years a resident . of Oakland.* married for
years, and his absences from Mrs. Blair
were the periods he passed with his
legitimate spouse in a costly residence on
East Oakland Heights. " , Â¦
This is the .skeleton of what Mrs.
Thorpe brought, but when. she. had
clothed it in words it' was a horrible vul
ture of blackest cruelty destined forever
to flap its uncanny wings before this
broken-hearted woman and cry her
.Mrs.. Thorpe- classed her. among the
abandoned of her sex, who had lured an

this ' poor sufferer , until at last ' the' woman
within her finding its powers of self-as
sertion,' she 'rose, majestic as a queen,
and through her proud eyes gleamed and
blazed the fire of a long life of unsullied
purity as she cried, "Go, fiend,' for you
are not human, or I will kill you.".
Through the doorway, as Mrs. Thorpe
hastened ' herv exit, ; there floated back to'
the woman without a name, as she heard
the prattle of her j children In the yard,
one . word Â¦ that broke her- heartâ"bas

That night Blair visited the home .which
he had wrecked. What passed;' within
those walls which had known so much of
happiness, it were better not to record.
He had come prepared to Â¦ make \ such
amends a ji lay within his power. He. had
executed In her name deeds of valuable
property and. policies: of life insurance,

Hl3 custom had. always been to cross a

tion of the city and to this place : Nero
had ' always . accompanied him" and thence

him. Even the brute avoided * his com
panionship! This night, as -usual, he tra
versed the vacant square. ,â¢ â¢ He ' never
emerged from it alive. ' ' . ' Â¦"'. ;'..;
Some hours later a patrolman found him
lying, : his spine broken and his jaws'. wide
open, his eye's' staring with. horror. 'â¢Â¦';.
As Blair entered .the square the officer
had seen a . woman ; crossing :' the street
toward him. .Aside from this there .was'
little' clew, save Â¦ that ; in the dead man's
mouth there .were some shreds of cloth,
torn from a garment in the effort of the
murderer to stifle his victim's cries..
The doctors attributed the death to suf
focation, claiming that the spine must
have been broken as the man fell..
( When the Coroner's jury was called At
torney George Daer, sitting in his office,
received a note from Mrs.. Blair request
ing him -to call. He was /accustomed to
criminal cases and doubtless his reputa
tion-had. been the reason of her selection
of , him. , '
He found -Mrsi. Blair with her children
at home. She stated that, she had -heard
it said . she would be held for the murder
of her husband." This wasnews'to Daer;'
he had not known that a breath of sus
picion pointed toward her.
She recounted what had transpired the
day and the night of the murder. Daer
questioned her carefully. 'As she proceed
ed in the narration of events. Daer began
to wish she had not 'called him into the
case, but now and again as he looked into
the depths of her wonderful eyes he' told
himself, that, she had had nothingito do

She", told" him* about the; papers. Curi
ously, enough, when the body was found
there were no papers in the pockets, ex
cept a few business cards, some hearing
the name. of Blair and some' that of
Thorpe. .
'', This reference to the' papers aroused in
Daer a -fresh - train of ; thought. ;. If Mrs.
Blair ,was interested In- securing the pa
pers, Mrs. Thorpe was equally interested
in obtaining possession of them.

platform- He has not confessed, but be
fore you I shall force from him a con
fession which shall carry with it to you
the absolute conviction of its truth. Let.
the Senor Antone Vitale be called." "
"Antone . Vitale." When Mrs. Blair
heard the name her thoughts flew back
over the years to that day at the old Car
mel Mission, and as there came back to ]
her a flood of memories of her girlhood,
daysâdays which the recent shame and*
sorrow and degradation had driven out oC
her thoughtâ she burst into tears. In
stinctively she placed her. hand on Nero' 3
head, where he crouched at her feet.
Of a sudden she forgot the wrongs her
husband had inflicted upon her, and wait
ed with a feeling of intense horror for the
appearance of his murderer.
There was a commotion and a tense
movement about the door of the court
room, when Antone Vitale walked through
the throng in the company of the Sheriff
and stepped on the platform before the
Judge and jury. His face â¢was. calm and
self-satisfied until, as he looked about the
room, his glance alighted upon Mrs. Blair,
her eyes seeming to burn into his very
soul.
His face flushed suddenly and then grew
deathly pale. He realized that that look
told him the woman was looking upon the
slayer of her husband.
Vitale was dressed in a short corduroy
coat and knee breeches, having very much
the appearance of a bicycle suit.
From a parcel he carried he took a slen
der bar of iron, and with the straps at
tached at either end he fastened it about
his shoulders "and waist. It was thus
placed extended along his spine.
He had not spoken a word. Attorney
Daer had not asked a question. The audi
ence whispered, "He is deaf 7 and dumb."
He proceeded with his plans methodical
ly. He placed a mask over his face. It
was made â¢ of Â¦ wire closely woven and
strong as- a baseball mask.
The spectators and jury whispered,
"The man Is crazy." V
These preparations completed. VitalÂ©
stepped backward to the center of the
platform "and emitted a peculiar, pene
trating, low whistle. Â¦
, From the prisoner's box there rang
forth a horrible cry and on the- instant
the spectators saw the great mastiff leap
from his mistress' side and rush toward
Vitale.
As he neared the man the latter stepped
aside, else the momentum had thrown
him to the floor. Then Nero turned
fiercely, reared on his hind legs and
threw his right foreleg clear around Vi
tale's body, the left foreleg Â¦ being bent
and pressed against' the mask.
About 'this leg there was tied a piece of
cloth. Then was presented one of the
mo3t k thrilling, dramas ever witnessed by
an Expectant throng. Back and forth,
here and there, across the stage this man
and Drute struggled in desperate en
counter. The dog. "muzzled at all times
by "order of the court, could not inflict
any injury with his teeth.. so the struggle
presented merely* a test of strength and
endurance.
Af^er a few minutes Vitale's left arm
was thrown upward in a frantic, appeal
ing gesture for help, and at that moment
the Judge, forgetting the digr.i ' of his
office. | rising from . his chair, cried excit
edly,''.'My God! .That flog is the murderer
of Robert Thorpe!"
Â¦ When Vitale, v^as rescued from the
steel-like grip of the big: brute* he fell* to
the: floor in a -faint, from which. hÂ»
shortly recovered. ;
The people then saw why he had mad*
use "of the iron bar. It had been bent by
the force of the dog's powerful foreleg so
that it pressed against Vitale's spine and
in. an Instant more would have resulted
in his death. _ The mask. too. presented a
crushed appearance, \and on some of the
broken wires were sNisnended shreds of
the cloth which had been fastened to the
animal's leg.'

verdict.. The Judge. had told the story oi

thus far had evaded those bonds wherein
man is said to give hostages to fortune.
This girl, however, struck his fancy by
her singular type of beauty. It lay in the
easy grace of her posture, the nonchalant
air cf her personality, the impenetrable
depth of her eyes. Her features were reg
ular, but without the lustrous glow of
these ver^ invLUng eyes she would have
fallen short of being more than ordinarily
attractive.
Antone caid to himself that ehe was
very beautiful, and then he asked her to
accept Nero a* a gift,
This time he did not ask her to go away

he thought, ehe laughed again and thank

mission, Nero following with a disdainful

This naturally was very disappointing
for Antone. byt he could not wait Just
now to pursuft the bent Â«f his fancy.' It
was necessary for Wra to go on to.Monte

horse and drove any 4 Of course, he in

Finally Antone sighed despairingly and
appealed to the girl to go away out of
eight. 6he looked up and laughedâ one of
those enticing* mirthful . laughs which
caused him to desire Its repetition.
Antone had had numerous "affairs," but
ing dignity as he walked off the stage.*
The next town at which he stopped he
essayed to repeat the performance, hav
ing escaped so easily at the first, but the
paternal guardian of the canine troupe
gave him such an ugly squeeze with his
teeth that Antone deemed it advisable not
to press matters, and abandoned the act.
To-day he had reached within a few
miles of Monterey, was approaching the
old Mission el Carmelo, when Nero
bounded out of the wagon and ran to
ward a young ffirl seated on a rude bench
near the entrance. When the dog reached
her he lay down at her feet with every
appearance of contented devotion, and all
the coaxings or threateniags of his mas
ter failed to affect him.
r"V ERTAINLY fate was disposed to
I f be fickle nnd. in a measure, un-
I l*\ kind to the Scnor Antone Vltale.
j^ For weeks and weeks he had met
, . ; everywhere with unvarying euc
ceps, his large troupe of trained dogs had
attracted overflowing houses and he had
begun to feel that he might snap his
fingers at fate.
Possibly that is why he was forestalled.
At Santa Barbara his three big mastiffs
had shown their teclh for the first time
in their lives, as if they weren't at all dis
inclined to proceed - further than a mere
exhibition. It had come about in this
wise: The three dogs were of one family
â father and mother and son. They were
not great trick dogs, but were bo very
Â¦ beautiful that every one said it was worth
the price of admission just to see them
walk across the stage.
On this particular evening Nero, the
Fon. proved refractory and Antone, who
may have lingered too long over his din
ner and wine with one of Santa Barbara's
dark-haired senoritas. forgetting that he
had never dared correct these animals)
with a whip, raised his short riding whip
menacingly. Before he had time to ad
minister a blow both the older dogs flew
at him and he was thrown to the floor so
violently as to render him well-nigh
senseless.
At first the audience gasped with fright
over the onslaught, but when they saw
that the dogs only held the trainer down
as they glared in his face, and did not
attempt to bite him, they took it to be a
regular feature of the programme and
Btraightway applauded vociferously.
The Senor Antone was brave, but this
attack had frightened him not a little. He
realized, however, what a good piece of
-acting it inunt appear to the audience
and resolved to add It to his repertoire.
He gradually released himself and rose
to his feet, bowing his acknowledgments,
thÂ« three dogs following him with becom-

course, later on as. their acquaintance
ripened he had always protested^against
that interpretation of his ' actions and
finally he had told her that she had be
come indispensable to his happiness. â'Â¦
Suddenly as she stood stroking the dog
and communicating her worries to him,
Nero growled and the girl drew back, not
understanding his threatening attitude.
She glanced over her shoulder and taw
her lover-entering/ the mission portal.
Turning she looked past him through ihe
doorway and on . the rise .of the hill
toward Del Monte, she saw that Antone
had stopped his horse and 'appeared to be
regarding this ".fresh /Arrival curiously.
Even as she looked .the dog trainer
He exclaimed that he thought her horse
was beyond her control and j running
away and of course here was nothing for
him to do but just what had been done.
Then she burst into a gale of irresistible
laughter over the absurdity of it all, and
walking to where her horse waited pa
tiently for her, she mounted, touchedher
whip to her tall hat and laughed as she
rode away.
Then, recovering from her astonish
ment, she asked what it all meant, as she
looked up at the handsome elderly indi
vidual who had dismounted and placed
her on her feet
It was here that she had met her lover.
It could hardly be called a "meeting."* It
was an overtaking. Her horse was gal
loping at his best down near the Chinese
Camp, where the ocean surge is loudest
after one emerges from the forest, when
ehe heard a clatter of hoofs behind her
and a voice calling out, "Be brave,"
then a strong arm thrown around her
waist and herself lifted from the saddle
before she realized what was happening,
while her horse, released so suddenly from
the burden of his rider, slowed down and
came to a ready halt as any well trained
thoroughbred might.
She was as much at home in the saddle
as a trained rider could be and every inch
of the famous Seventeen Mile Drive,
through the grounds at Del Monte and
Pacific Grove, and the long avenue, of
pines and Cypress Point and Pebble
Beach was so familiar that she felt 'were
she an artist she could sketch a, perfect
and enchanÂ£ing panorama of its Inviting
length from memory. Â¦
Yesterday she had been the recipient
of an offer of marriage and to-Â«lay was
to give her answer in this very spot sa
cred to her from earliest childhood. She
knew every nook and corner of the old
structure as familiarly as the walls of her
own home, and before the old altar rail
she stood a little while pondering over
her own inclinations in the matter of
marriage.
The man in the case was certainly a
desirable partner, all things considered,
but she disliked to relinquish her own in
dependence, and as she stood in the mis
sion she stroked Nero's massive head and
told him all her perplexing doubts.
Possibly had the girl quite understood
Antone's peculiar disposition she might
not have laughed when he asked her to
go away and might have refused the gift
of even so magnificent a specimen of
caninlty as Nero, but she wa.s burdened
with other thoughts of graver import this
day and the advent of Nero was a relief
to her while that of Antone was not.
That was why she entered the old mis
sion and disappeared, glad to 'escape the
further attention whose .approach she
saw heralded in Vitale's eyes.
So, being: rid of a refractory and unap
preclativ'e dog, Antone whistled cheerily
as he took a look back at the half ruined
structure, which hid from view a maid
who was to have a distinct influence on
his future.

This is all very elaborate, and a great
development from the first Mint, in > San
Francisco.. That was established in '54,
on-* Commercial street, above Montgom
ery. When the cornerstone of the present
Mint was laid, in 1870, there*. were great
plans ahead. The cost or site and build
ing amounted to $3,130,512,150. "We must
live up to this cost," said the powvrs that
were.
So they set about making elaborate sys
tems by which to carry on the business
of the largest mint) in the world.
This system , was all to protect Uncle
Sam's money against the knave and the
fool-
It hasn't worked.
The increase of the bullion fund in the
last four years is remarkable; the credit
is doubled'. In 1897, when Frank A. Leach
was appointed Superintendent, the amount
was $54,601,411 00, and last January the
credit was over $108,000,000. .

The htad bookkeeper is cognizant of all
these complicated transactions, as all ac
counts of the various departments pass
through his hands. He compiles these ac
counts and forwards them daily, monthly
or semi-annually to Washington, just as
the importance of the reports demands.
A somewhat intricate system of ac
counts is in vogue at the Mint, and abso
lute accuracy is demanded, especially as
the sums considered are iÂ§ the aggregate
very large. For instance, computation is
ir.ade to the millionth of a cent, hence a
long row of. figures stretches before the

There is consternation but not despairâ
for there is more where that came from.
However, Uncie Sam is trying hard
enough to find the man or woman who
has the money.
The wise ones on h'.s force, and others,
are groping in the dark for the cash and
the thief. Some claim to have "struck a

âthe minority have the good, sense to

Uncle Sam will have a hard time ac
counting for the golden disks; there is a
$416,587 deficit in the San Francisco Mint
(since '54) that has never explained itself
to his satisfaction.
The first shortage in the bullion ac
counts of our Mint came forward in '56.
At the" time the melter and refiner made
a wastage of something like $153,000 in
excess of his legal allowance. The at
torneys for the defendant at the trial
made the allegation that' the flue of the
refinery was sadly in need of repair, per
mitting gold to escape in unnecessary
quantity by exhalation in the aeriform
state. .This was reinforced by the state
ment that the assayer, whose reports de
termine the value of the bullion delivered
to the melter, was "akin to madness"
and made wild, unreliable assays. This
was the best the defense could offer.
The fiue leaked "hot air."
In *C5 $20,000 dropped out of sightâ the
cashier was reported an ex-thief any
Â¦way, so he disappeared. The money
never came back.
In '67 more coin was missed. This time

money eo?
One thousand nine hundred and fifty-
Bix dollars was lost in JS65.
When a loss occurs, when sqmething is
"missed," all the money in the Mint must
be counted! That looks like a big task at
firet glance.
On second thought, however, is it a
task?

A "counting board" is used for count-
Ing- the dimes, quarters and halves, a
board for each denomination. There are
grooves cut ir. each board, arranged in
such a manner that the "half" and
"quarter" boards bold just $250 each. The
dime board holds Cl'-'j in coin, or 1250
pieces.
. When the boards are full, all you've
got to do is to count the boards.
But the chief weigher wants to be sure,
so he dumps the dimes intp a pan and
weighs them. The' weight should balance
with the count.
Gold coin is put up in sacks of $5000

Especially rigorous is the Seri law
concerning marriage (1. e., the first mar
riage, for the incidental polygamy of
later decades seems but a ripple on the
surface of deeper thought and custom).
The sacrament fills a year from the first
mootings to the final feast. During thte
period the groom is banned (under pain
of outlawry) to show perfect manhood,
according to tribal standards, by suc
cessfully passing the most strenuous tests
of providence and continence; during the
same period the prospective bride occu
pies a place of character making prom
inence in clan and tribe, and the probation
ends in a feast measuring the skill ol the
groom as fisherman and hunter and the
thrift of the bride as a maker of wares,
and hence fixing the place of the pair In
tribal esteem. A besetting fallacy pro
claims that law is lacking in primitive
life, and that the conjugal relations of
the prime were laxer than in later times.
Many recent facts point' the fallacy, but
the Clearest indication of all is found- in

Throughout .Seriland (as implied, in
deed, by the proper designation "Our-
Great-Mother-Folk-Here") the matron
holds higher rank than even the dough
tiest warrior. The tribal law is founded
oh faith and expressed. in terms of kin
ship and relative age; the kinship i3
traced only in the maternal line (in fact,
it is questionable whether paternity ia
recognizedâ the female has no word for
father, and the term used by the- male
to denote his sire seems of doubtful
meaningâ and there are no old men in the
tribe). So the matron Is priestess, law- Â¦
giver and judge, while her brothers in or
der of age are the appellate executives,
and her spiouse merely a perpetual guest
from another clan without voice In do
mestic affairs, save perchance in social
tumults attending war. The woman is
the prepotent factor in tribal existence;
she is the shaman who brews the magic
arrow poison: the Wise One who ca3t3
protecting charms over outgoing warriors
and lays spells on enemies; she is the
shaper of the life-preserving olla, the
maker of the sacred hair-corn; she is the
lady of the feast, sharing tlya portions j
and keeping alive the distributive tabus
by which the rights of tho weak are pro
tected; she is the blood carrier and the
face-mark bearer of the clan; and at
death she is buried with ceremony and
mourned long and loud as a link in the
tribal lineage, while her warrior spouse
rots where he falls.
In their own view the glory of the' Seri
tribe is in their hair; it is black , and
luxuriant, and is, worn long by both sexes,
who brush and cultivate Â¦ it with tireless
assiduity; it is not merely, admired, but
revered nearly, or quite urito worship, and
interwoven with faith in a Samsonian cult

That was the situation In surgery the
world over until Dr. J. B. Murphy of Chi
cago invented the Murphy button. This is
a small device of aluminum by which di
vided intestines can be united. The de
vice was not then perfect, but it at once
brought down the mortality from wounds
of this character ' from 97 per cent to a
little over 15 per cent. Then Dr. Nicholas
Sennâ the man who is leading the Ameri
can quartet of surgical demonstrators
abroadâ saw. that this invention could be
combined with a discovery of his own,
and so great 'was the devotion to science
of the two men that they "worked Jointly
for the good of humanity to produce a de
vice which should be perfect. This, they
think, they have found in a device which
employs decalcified bone instead of metal.
Decalcified bone is ordinary bone from
which all lime as well as the animal mat
ter has been removed. This, when used
to join severed Intestines, is absorbed by
the tissues as soon as Its mending work is
done. The original Murphy button some
times remained as a foreign body and
caused trouble! Decalcified bone plates
were first used by Dr. Senn in 1883.
This somewhat lengthy account of the
surgical wonders wrought by Drs. Mur
phy and Senn is given here because it
was the main reason which induced the
surgeons of Europe to invite Dr. Senn and
his colleagues to make their tour. Wounds
of the abdomen are the most frequent,
the most difficult and the most fatal of
all the 'wounds which surgeons meet with
in their work. In the American Civil War
CS per cent of ull wounds were^t'ounds
of the abdomen, and of these 97 per cent
died. In the recent war with Spain al
most the same percentage of wounds of
the al "(lumen veto obtained on the Amer
ican sJde. but instead of a mortality of
OS per cent* It was less than 10 per cent.
The difference was due to American sur
gery. Similar methods' were used by En
glish burgeons in the South African war
with equally gratifying results..- The^eon
eequence has been a tidal wave of appre
ciation of American surgery^ the first
ripple of which has borne away 'Dr. Â¦ Senn
and his coadjutors to give clinical'de
monstrations of their methods."
Almost every European country except
England has asked the quartet,. to hold
clinics In their capitals. The reason: that
England has not done" so is because Dr.
Senn is almost as well known in the Lon
don operating theaters'as he" is here. The
English appreciated his, methods almost
as "quickly as his own countrymen and
have carefully copied his surgical tech
ninciue." Â¦ n * Â¦" . â¢Â¦
The planned 'itinerary of the. medical
quartet began on July 4, when Drs. Senn,
MastJn and Brower sailed from New Vork
on the steamship Barbarossa. Their* first
FOUR noted American surgeons and
physicians have just started on a
tour of ths world, the object of
which is to demonstrate to the doc
tors of Europe and Asia the American
system of surgery and medicine. Tr.e
Â¦welcome which will be accorded to them
abroad will be real, for the quartet is
headed by Dr. Nicholas Senn of Chicago,
who is regarded as tTie leading American
surgeon. The other members of the par
ty are Dr. D. R. Brewer and Dr. Jacob
Frank of Chicago, and Dr. Mastin of Mo
bile, Ala. The tour is being made at the
request of foreign doctors, who are anx
ious to see a competent exposition of the
American methods of surgery and medi
cine. Dr. Daniel R. Brower is a famous
specialist in nervous diseases. The others
are surgeons. .
Until a very few years ago no American
surgeon or physician used to think his
education complete unless he had spent
two or three years In the medical schools
of Germany, England or France. At that
time it was a superstition that the Euro
pean schools of medicine were superior
to those o'f this country and that the sur
gical technique was better. Nowauiys
the situation is reversed. Every year
finds more and more graduates of foreign
medical schools enrolled In American in
ftitutlons, to which they have come to
complete their professional education.
This change has been brought about by
th<s somewhat tardy recognition of Ameri
ca's place in the field of progressive sur
gery. The world owes the boon of an
esthesia to this country. Aseptic surgery,
also. has. been developed here to a point
which was practically unknown abroad.
Then, too, men and women used to Olo
by thousands every year from a mysteri
ous disease wiilch began with a violent
prostrating pain In the right side ami
ended in death within a week. American
surgery established the fact that this dis
ease was due to an obstruction of the ver
miform appendjx, and it worked out the
now simple and cafe operation of removal
of the appendix for appendicitis. Beiure
this operation was discovered people why
died from appendicitis were given death
certificates which read "peritonitis,** or
else "intestinal obstruction."
Before the present era of American sur
gery a wound In the abdomen was thought
to be necessarily fatal. The Internal or
gans are covered with a thin and exceed
ingly delicate membrane known as the
periton<mm. " Under the old regime. If this
membrane was cut or violently bruised,
peritonitis set In and the patient died. If
a man was shot or stabbed in the abdo
men, so that the intestines were severed.
It was then a surgical axiom that nothing
could be done for the patient. He would
eurely die. The accepted treatment, was
to dose the wounded mac with opium and
professional stopping place will be at Ber
lin, where they will pick up 'Dr. Jacob
Frank, who preceded the party by some
days because he had*an urgent request to
hold a special surgical clinic at Profes
sor Landau's private'hospital for women
in Berlin. This is one of \ the most fa
mous institutions in Europe. The four
will stay at Berlin for several days, and,
although the regular terms are ended for
the season at the medical schools, a num
ber of special clinics have been arranged
at which the distinguished American sur
geons are expected to demonstrate their
methods.
If the regular itinerary Is followed, Dr.
Senn will next lead his party to Moscow,
where both Dr. Frank and Dr. Senn have
been requested to' hold clinics for the
benefit of the Russian surgeons. This will
be Dr. Frank's second visit to Moscow,
as he attended the session of the Inter
national Medical. Association held there
three years ago. At that time his methods
attracted a great deal of attention, and
It Is said that he remarked that the Rus
sians ought to see Dr. Senn, who origl-/
nated the methods he used. Sinofc that
time there has been a heavy Russian de
mand for the" presence of Dr. Senn.
About July 20, unless the plans of the
party have been materially disarranged/,
they will . leave Moscow for Irkutsk,
traveling thither by the train de lux,e of
the Siberian Railway. Irkutsk, it is
hoped by the four, 1 will be one" of the
places at which they will not be expected
to. hold a clinic. Dr. Senn and his com
panions want to; spend ten days at
Irkutsk, exploring Lake Baikal and hunt
ing and fishing.. Thence they will"jour
ney to Strctinsk nnd take a steamship
down the Amur River to a Jown with, a
name that can be spelled seven different
ways. Lago Vestsch ' -Â«k is oneof them.
Thereafter the quartet will travel among
Siberian towns with queerly. spelled names
until they finally reach "'. , Vladivostok,
which is the terminus of tho Siberian
Railroad. From Vladivostok they will go
to Korea, on their way to Japan, stopping
long enough to pay a visit to Seoul.
Â¦ t_ Â¦ Â¦ ... . .** . t .
Japan will , probably show the four
American surgeons and physicians more 1
honors than even the countries of Europe,
for, all the hospitals of Japan are ar
ranged on the American plan. Japan used
to send air'its medical students "to Eng
land, some" of them afterward going to
Germany and France to complete, their
course. , To-day very few medical student3
go to England, for Japan, -which was one
of the first countries to recognize Ameri
ca'si surgical .supremacy, long ago dis- (
covered that the, education given by,; the
best of the American medical colleges was â¢
better for practical work than that to-be
obtained In Europe. â¢ Tho theory of!sur
gery and medicine Is splendidly taught In
Europe, but for ' practice America leads. '
Japan, too, has reason to be. proud of the.
fact that s^ie has so closely ' followed
American methods. In medical science, for
It has resulted in* the little Asiatic .coun-'
try numbering among its native born citi
zens one of the most noted. bacteriologist 1 *
In the * worldâ Kitasato. To the 'labors of
Kitasato are due most of the exact facts
now known about the! microbes of "the
bubonic' plague, diphtheria andl" cancer."
Kitasato is also the inventor Â¦ of ;a great
many instruments of precision and is the
author of many valuable books and "par
pers on scientific subjects. .
The American surgeons will land at Na
gasaki and will go thence to Yokohama,
where a series of clinics will be held. The
Japanese clinics are- expected to be of
great interest to N the Americans, as sev
eral-little known diseases can be studied
there.. Moreover, someT of the Japanese
schools "still maintain, a few of the older
ajrid peculiarly. Asiatic! methods of treat
ment, and while some of these are a little
astonishing' to foreign surgeons, it is ad
mitted that they have their advantages.
These Chinese and Japanese have, for ex
ample, a most remarkable way of "set
ting" broken ribs, which; ; while drastic,
seems to '. be frequently successful. The
human rib, It should be â¢ understood, is
not often broken, as its. structure and po
sition renders a straight fracture very
difficult, but they are often so badly bent
Inward as to be spoken of as a broken rib.
It* is very difficult' for a_Â£&UÂ£asl&a sur-
geon to, straighten out^ these 'in bent ribs,
but a Chinese ( or-' Japanese surgeon, it Is
said, accomplishes the feat with- facility
and dispatch. " â¢ '"" " . .

Panama Hat Worn by Theodore Roberts of the ; Frawfley Company.

The Panama hat!
It is undoubtedly correct, and men
wHo would be up to daten.ust own
one. be it - ssnuine and worth ten
fives, or Jurt a clever imitation, whose tag
cays two-fifty.
Not for twenty years has Panama straw
been in such demand as now.
One or two of the ,hatmakers who are
arbiters cf masculine fashion are respon
sible for the resurrection, and presumably .
South American straw weavers are rising
up an I calling those autocratic gentlemen ;
blessed. The supply of finer grades of the.
straw is "already practically exhausted,
and though the cheap straw can be woven
to order rapidly, the finer quality of Pan
ama cannot be produced in a hurry, no
matter what the urgency of Â¦ the demand
may bs. * An expert cannot make, a hat
of the very best quality in less thah'seven
or eight months, and even' the hats that
are not so fine are a matter- of months. \
. Women do the weaving, the men.riever,
having been able to master the artfvin its
perfection, though . some native men do
plait straw after a fashion. The industry
is common in almost all the South Ameri-^
can countries, but the lion's share of the
best Panama straw. comes from Venezu
ela. .'Â¦;' : ; < ::".'- v,
The straw Is woven from a marsh grass,
and .the -quality, of^the finished; product
depends as much upon'" the quality, of . the
grass as upon; the ',work. ' ..~>i^. * :* !
For the best straw, the grass is careful
ly sorted 'and .selected, only .the -'finest
stalks being chosen. . â¢ Then ; the' woman
who is to weave . it" sauats : herself down!

then, you know. .one pays- for Tou
remember the summer that Panama hats
were the rage, you gave $40 for a perfect
ly plain - one â not even an egret | on it,"
she will" say.
Oh, the men who buy Panamas are lay
ing up trouble for; themselves! Still, they
buy the hats and they retreat behind the
excuse of durability.* A manidbesn't buy
a hat because- it is the fashion, even
though It is l a bit 'of mad extravagance.
Perish Jhe* thought! He invests in Pan
ama straw at $40 per because the hat will
wear forever. In all human probability,
never again, in the course of his natural
lifetime,' will he need to. buy a straw hat.
Say he." lives twenty years. '- One . $5 straw
hat a season for twenty years means $100.
That is two and one-half, times the $40
expended" on the imperishable" Panama."
The number of men who are doing that
sum to convince themselves and their,bet
ter-halves that a Panama hat at $40 is the
cheapest thing they can buy is legion.
Of course they cfon't believe it, but it
salves, their consciences to think they do.
There are : men who buy $150 Panama
hats without a quiver and are unashamed,
but they are the men who have unlimited
money or unlimited credit, which Is mucn
the same thing.
The finest Panama hat ever seen In this
..country, and probably as. fine a specimen
"of the work as was ever turned out, be
longed to General Grant. It was given to
him during his first term and was worth
$500. ;
Panama hats are bought by the import
ers in the ordinary , native shape, with
broad, flat crown and a wide rim slightly
rolled. ~in the hat factories here. they are
bleached, cleaned end shaped to suit the
prevailing styles, the Alpine shape being
the superlatively correct thing this sum
mer.' Â¦
The cheap Panama hat, so called, worn
by nine out of every ten men on the street,
Â¦is a poor imitation of the genuine article.
Many of these hats are not made of any
thing approaching Panama straw. "The
rest, aro of French Panama straw. '.Great
quantities of Panama grass are exported
from South America to France, where the
grass Is split and woven into French or
split Panama.' Even in South America
some split Panama straw Is made. The
grass is split so carefully that often no
one save a connoisseur could ti;ll the fin
ished straw from genuine â¢ whole grass
Panama; but it is far inferior in durability
and texture and isjriot worth one-fifth the
value. of the genuine Panama.
Â¦Next. to Panama straw in value comes
beside . a big, earthenware jar , of water,
takes a handful of. grass and begins her
work,' under/ the ; surface of the water.
Every inch | of -the hat is woven .under
water, this care being' necessary in order
to keep the grass j moist and prevent its
splitting and breaking during the plaiting!
-.Day after day, and month "after month,
the woman sits by . the water jar, work
ing with infinite care, and, in seven, eight
or more, -probably nine months, a hat 1 is
ready , for the Arherican or Englishman
who has money to burn. Few Panama
hats of fine "quality/are worn in 'South
America." .To be sure, little of anything is
worn by' a large part of the population,
but even the hat weaving' element cannot
afford the luxury of a fine Panama. â¢
In fact, few of the best hats ever find
their way. lnto"the general market. They
are picked up by individuals. English and
American travelers, officers on trading
ships or men-of-war, foreign Consuls or
traders -buy the hats for themselves or
for friends 'at home, and, of course, the
output is comparatively small. It has
been smaller than ever within, recent
years, for the demand has not been great
enough 'to encourage the-industry, and it
has been with the South American straw
weavers as with our Indian basket weav
ers. The younger . generation . has not
taken to the art so kindly as its forbears
did, and there are few of the young
women who can compete with their
grandmothers in weaving skill. .;
Even on its native heath , a good Pan
artla hat is expensive, one of good quality
bringing about $40 in American money and
often more, -, though/ loosely woven,' infe
rior straw hats may be had for almost
any price, even as little as a few cents in
our coin. In New York shops the price of
a genuine Panama straw hat ranges from
$12 to $150. but there are few of the latter
in stock, and the $10 or $50 hats are about
the limit of man's extravagance.
"Well, it's a love of a toque, John. Of
course, $30 doea seem a good deal to. pay
for one rose and a fold of chiffon, ,but
Â¦ . Â¦.-.Â»Â¦* Â¦. Â»
Many a wife is rejoicing over the ad
vent of tjrfe Panama, and it's a brave man
who dares to tell his wife that he paid
$40 for his straw hat. Never again can
ho indulge in the scathing satire anent
.women's bonnets that is so dear to thi
average husband. Never can he point
, with modest pride totbe $5 straw hat
that has lasted. two seasons and demon

and "careworn. He has put a weapon into
his enemy's hand, and she's no sort of
woman if she doesn't use it.
a very fine quality of split straw manu
factured in Belgium. Some of^ these hats
are expensive and the work upon them
is remarkably good.
Japan furnishes many of the straws
that are used for men's hats here. A new
Japanese braid called Kurako is popular
for sailor hats this summer. The Chinese
do a good deal of straw plaiting, but pro
duce only inferior qualities, though they
are improving in their split straw and it
is beginning to assume some importance.
France, Italy, Saxony. Belgium and Eng
land send us straw. -
Filipino straws are being worn to some
extent hene this season and have the merit
of being cool and well-ventilated, but they
are cheap and poor in qaullty. Porto
Kican hats are coarsely woven and in
ferior, but there is talk of a development
of the industry in Porto Rico, under the
stimulus of United States capital and
management, and hat makers believe that
a fine grade of straw could be made there.
In Mexico the palma grass is woven into
sombreros of varying qualities, but even
the. best Mexican hat is not worth more-,
than $25. The hat of this quality Is finely
woven, but has not the Panama, virtue of
lightness. On the other hand, the cheap
straw sombreros, woven of wheat straw,
are cool, light end practically indestructi
ble, though coarse and inelegant in ap
pearance. The Mexican straw hats are.
finding a ready sale here this summer for
the first time, and a certain type of girl
looks uncommonly fetching under tha
high conical crown and broad curling
brim. Â¦
Women are affecting the Panama hats,
too,, but in the original broad-brimmed
shape more often than in the Alpine. Tha
lightness and durability of the hats make
them eminently desirable for rough out
ing wear, but the tightly woven braid for
bids ventilation, and many a heavy hat Is
cooler than a Panama,
The man who cwns a genuine fine Pana

No straw Is woven In this country. La
bor is not cheap enough to make the thing:

made here whs the old Macklnac straw,

Although the great honor in the shoot
lngat Shell Mound went to a local man,
the Easterners did some exceedingly good
work. They struggled under adverse con
ditions, not of light or wind, but of a too
persistent - hospitality. - Shooting,, like
every, other. kind of physical competition,
demands a conditioned body. : The -East-/
ern marksmen were the targets for the
local entertainers. Rhine wine, cham
pagne, late suppers, parties in their honor
at all times, were fastened upon the shoot
ers and no refusal would hold good; Shell

men have a crystallized grasp on the rifle.
Sometimes they experiment, but .this is
rare. 'As a rule every marksman handles
his gun in a - peculiar Â¦â¢ individual way.
Years of shooting have taught their les
sons to these men, and after they pass
the early stages of sharpshooting they
form a style of their own and then seldom
deviate from It.' The ' accompanying pic

honors so bravely and honestly won.
Of all the echoes of the shooting fes
tival the one that is loudest Is the dispute
among the marksmen in regard to the
relative merit of rapid- sharpshooting or
deliberate, slow and postponed'rifle-per
formances for the kingly honors. Adolph
Strecker is a rapid sharpshooter, and he
is king with a score., of S94 . on the point
target. Louis P. Ittel of Pittsburg is a
elow performer, a man that waits upon
time, place and circumstance 'before he
steps Into the stalls for "work. "When he
shoots his bo'Jy must be attuned to the
work in front of him. He does not run
his strings out in rapid, successive order.
Strecker, on the other, hand, keeps' up a
steady flre.and In a Blnglciday finishes
the 200 shots for" the highest honors a
rifleman may reach in America. William
Hayes is also a. rapid shooter. When he
â¢won the kingship in 1898 his twenty strings
were made In five hours. Think of it, 200
shots In that space of time! Almost a shot
a minute, which is marvelous work when
the v time consumed' In filling, ramroding
and loading is considered. No wonder,
then,- that after the glory is fought for
and won the king is physically a wreck.
Unkinged William Hayes â¢ said a few
nights ago, when the. air sizzled with gun
shot reminiscences', that a feather*' blown
against him three minutes after his king
shoot would have laid him supine on the
floor. Hayes is if man of remarkable nerv
ous force and in'Iooks far more wiry and
capable of muscular .endurance than
Strecker. The California , king j scouts
every venture, into -the solution of . the
character puzzle. -Thin /and spare of fig
ure, he is a wonder, for pure .nervous
force.' After his remarkable shooting, ac
complished In a single day, he was bright,
strong and keenly alert to everything that
was transpiring about him. ,

the * record chatterers- and the ibullseye

as good as he was in the days of muscle
without adipose. His nerve and the fine
quality of precise muscular articulation
seem to vanish. . < ,

FIFTEEN HUNDRED JAPANESE SOLDIERS ARE REQUIRED TO PROTECT THE CAMPHOR INDUSTRY OF FORMOSA.
THE large Island of Formosa, off the
east coast of China, fell to Japan a
few years ago as one of the prizes
of war. The Island Is famous for
two products. The hill slopes of the west
grow some of the finest teas in the world,
the Oolongs and other Formosan teas
being highly esteemed in this country,
where nearly the entire crop is consumed.
The tree-dad mountains of. the east con
tain the largest camphor forests In the
world.. Most of the camphor kept in our
drug stores comes from Formosa. Japan
now produces only about 300,000. pounds
a year; the yield in China "has never ex
ceeded 220,000 pounds aÂ»year; but 7.000,000
pounds, of camphor were taken from the
forests of Formosa in LS93 and In the past
four years the annual yield has averaged
over 6,000,000 pounds. "Formosa' controls
the camphor market of the world and will
probably always be the/great source of
this valuable gum. For some time past
the purchasers of camphor have been
compelled to pay more for It than former
ly. The two principal reasons for the In
crease In price wUL.be mentioned here;
one of them is specially Interesting, for It
illustrates the difficulties arid dangers that
environ the camphor industry.- â¢Â« ..'
The mountains of .East Formosa are In
habited by savage. tribes' who are the bane
of the. island. Nearly, half of; Formosa* is
still occupied by. these murderous' men of
the forest whose weapons are â¢*.'- turned
against all- strangers. The Â¦! fertile 5 plains
of the west, filled with peaceful Chinese
tillers of the. soil, present a t very different
aspect. : For , many years it was almoot
certain death; for sailors to be. wrecked
on the. east coast of the island. If they
escaped the sea' they 'were murdered by
the savages, y who . were'' always*, on the
lookout- for loot from vessels driven upon
the rocks of their, inhospitable coast. Ex
plorers have', not 'dared to venture. Into
some parts of ' these : mountains ' which are
still among . the leasts knownV portions of
thci world. The : savages are full of .: cun
ning and treachery. ' They are armed, with
bows and arrows,' knives and ; swords."
They are .very dark and muscular and ro
about "culte naked," except "for > a Fcanfy
strip of blue cloth ; about, the : waist.; In
recent years many of them have, acquired
matchlocks and. learned to use them. Â¦
.' ;. One day , a . few j years Â¦ ago,' j a party of

up into the mountains and met a party of
'^natives armed with 'matchlocks. -* .They'

cost of protecting -the camphor gatherers
is added to the cost of the' commodity and
there 'seems to be no reason "to complain

. Thi3;is the- principal reason why the^

is another reason for It also," and it may
be said ; that Â¦ the Â¦, price Â¦ Is likely \ to* con

that the* amount to be produced this year
would not - exceed 40.000 piculs (5,320,000

Stiff pirme stocks have for a, long time

such as ties and ribbons and scarfs, but
betides being extremely uncomfortable
these stocks are the hottest things imag
inable. Of a necessity they must be very
stiff, and naturally- they are perfectly im
pervious to air. Their day, however, is
over, for a most delightful substitute has
been found in the mousseline collar, which

throat spoils the entire effect-.
OLLARS and stocks this season
I / are prettier and daintier than
I \\ ever, and for coolness they have
j^ yet to be surpassed. Simplicity
seems to be the keynote of fash
ionable neckwear, with a decided prefer
ence for thyj collar that is made on th'i
bodice.
The smartest blouses have the yoke and
collar fashioned together in what is called
the lingerie style. This blouse does not
look well on evtry woman, and only tho
possessor of good shoulders and grace
fully rounded throat finds the unbroken
line fiom belt to the tip of the ears par
ticularly suited to her. This collar is real
ly the yoke extended, and the bodice de
~y(sign is prettily continued to its very top.
A charming blouse that shows entre
deux of lace and fine tucking running
around has the rame scheme showing in
the neck finish. If the stripes of lace are
put in diagonally, then the collar follows
the same pattern.
Lace and tuckinsr Jn Van Dyke points
fern-, the mode of trimming on another
attractive blouse, which has a -collar to
match, or, to speak correctly, forming a
part of the hodice itst'f, for these collars
are not detachable any more than the
jokes are. The material used for this
bodice is pale pink silk mull, sheer and
delicate. The rounded yoke is formed of
the mull in tiny lingerie tucks, which are
just a pinr'h of the material caught up
and stitched so that they appear like fine
cording.
Around the' outer edge of the yoke and
In curved rows extending to the waist are
let in band* of lace inserting, made Â«n
Van Dyke points. At the base of the
threat the top of the yoke is cut in the
same points, with a row of the Van Dyke
lace inserted, fitting the neck closely.
This forms the lower part of the collar.
Above this row of lace is dovetailed a
band of the vertical cutting, cut off
Another smart ruffle Is of white net
showing a faint dot outlined in, black.
Black velvet ribbons are used with this,
and the effect, though, odd, is particularly;
gO.Q,d. _ /
For wear on days that are not too warm
ruffles are the vogue, and just now they
are broader and fluffier than ever before.
"White and black or the combination of the
two are most popular, and silk net is tha
material from which the smartest are
made. The ruffle is quite broad and i3
long enough to extend to the bust lineÂ»
where the ends are tied with knots and
long streamers of velvet ribbon. The
streamers themselves are caught about at
the waist line and fastened with a rosette
of ribbon. *At the center of the back is
another chou of the velvet. A ruffle of
all white silk net and black velvet ribbon
is very fashionable.
Among separate stocks the newest Is thi
artists* model, a pretty design fashioned
of white silk showing Roman stripes, and
when the broad bias ends cross in front
there is fastened a tiny gold buckle.
"Sometimes the top of the collarless
blouse is cut in points or it is left round,
*n which case, the finish is a band of lacÂ«
'insertion, showing, ju5.tab0ve.the edga
ot the bodice. Pearls are" appropriate foi
wear with this bodice and the crushed col
lar of tulle fastened at the back in a chou
is als.o a pretty accompaniment.
These, tulle choux are worn with both
low and high necked bodices, but they are
a fancy that will probably not outlive the
nOrCOllar fad. â¢ .
For perfection of cSofness, however, thÂ«
collarless bodice is without., an equal
among the modish woman's afternoon
blouses. The style Isn't one that should
ie.*adopte(i indiscriminately, however. ThÂ«
bodice cut ofC abruptly at tlia base of tha
throat makes, a break in line that is vastly
unbecoming to the woman who doesn't
boast perfectly" shaped shoulders and slenÂ«

drove the - Polynesian race out of India
and"-. that the Polynesians -gradually ac
quired the art of navigation, pushed out
into unknown seas and made their way to
the Pacific. : ; ' ;. .
Ages must have passed- while the people
dwelt In those parts. They became navi
gators, crossing the neighboring seas, ac
quiring^ many! customs of a Semitic origin,
together . with some : words of their - lan
guage. This racVwas probably dwelling
in Arabia r and the . shores of the Persian-
Gulf. But a : time came when the Aryan
race began to make its" appearance, in
India, a race of superior caliber and prob
ably more numerous. "Before this intrud
ing race -the ancient Polynesians gradu
ally retreated, but not at once. There was
a .period â¢ when much intercourse took
place "between 'the two races.
.There Â¦ are some who believe that the
wonderful vigor and physique of the Poly
nesians will enable the race to exist. The
Polynesians are the finest and most inter- 1
estlng native race in the world without a
doubt. They are as bold as the frontier
tribes of India, whom, Indeed-, they much
resemble . without being Â¦ so â¢ sordid.
In many . customs, words and legends
they resemble the ancient Peruviansâ the
inhabitants of Western South Americaâ "
and yet it appears that the race once in

be Indiaâ Inland India, the plains and

The origin of the Polynesian ; race! is
wrapped In mystery. Having no historical
records, their whole knowledge of the past
being confined to oral traditions, and being
a Â¦. wandering race, they knew little
themselves and less about their origin.
Our ethnologists have tried; to "trace, the

1FUCI> in my genealogical researches
regarding the Polynesian races that
the Maoris, Tongans,' Tahltians, Sa
moan3 and Hawailans can, without
difficulty, be proved one and the same
family. My researches carry us back un
erringly to a period of probably 1000 years
ago, -which may be considered as fairly
remote in two ancestral lines, as thus:
Maoriâ Tol, Whatonga, Raura. ' ; â¢::-'
Samoan- Ta. Atonga, Raulu.
Maorlori (the people, who are supposed
to have inhabited New Zealand before
the Maoris)â Tol, Hatonga, Raura.-
Here we have absolute agreement In the
order and names of these ancestors of the
Maori and Samoans. The variation in
orthography is due to the peculiar dialect
â¢which the latter have no doubt contracted
by closer contact with their barbarous
Epeaking neighbors of the west By trac
ing these lines down to the present day it
Â¦will be found that they severally give a
mean of about forty generations; some
more, others again less. Assuming twenty
five years to fairly represent a generation,
Â¦we have here a period in Polynesian his
tory of 1000 years ago; which absolutely
accords with that of their kindred of Sa
moa, whUe that of the Maoriori, whose
Isolation from New Zealand was as com
plete as that of the Samoan, also t glve the
- names in the same order. If not fully:
Raratonganâ Moemetua, Moeltiiti.
Tahltlanâ Moeteraur, Moeltiiti.
Maoriâ Mouriarl, Moitilti.
Finally, if we choose to review a period
which is at the least twenty generations,
or about 500. years earlier," 1500 years ago,
-we may do so thus:
Hawaiianâ Laka, Wahieioa, Aloha,
Maoriâ Rata, Wahiero, Aroha.
Samoanâ Talofa.

cided that Han , was too ugly to form one
party, as he wore j a beard, so it
was I decided that he should be left be
hind, for it would never do to parade such
a plain . fellow before the famous beauty '.
Rakahanga.' Thus the party, left without
him,, but Han, wiiowas a man endowed
with certain wondrous powers, hid him
self behind the prenake or bow of the
canoe which conveyed the party to
Taurariga and so. arrived -safely at the I

landed arid proceeded to the village where

Raka was much disgusted to find in him
so Ill-favored a mail, ana tnÂ« other chiefs
were much disgusted that this ugly fel
low should win so charming' a girl.
"So the Chief Kiwi disregarded" Han's
claims, took Rakahanga as a i wife for
himself Â» and accompanied : by his friend
(Weka. they started by -an inland track to

TUCSON, July 27.â Swift was'the venge
ance meted out to Ignacio Rivera, a Mex-~
lean vaquero,- by. a party of cowboys from
a ranch twenty-five ' miles south" of ..Tuc
son last night. Â¦ : Rivera's ', crime '. was the
stealing of a horseâ a capital on
the border. He was pursued by a "party
of men of the ranch from which the horse
was taken, lassoed after a chase of five
miles and strung up to a mesquite tree.
Not. until this ' morning, -when 'his body
was found swinging from a limbiwas the
fate that had overtaken him made known.
So silently and swiftly* did the self-con
stituted executioners carry out their plans
that It is not known even yet from what
ranch they came, nor has any light been
thrown upon events leading up to ihe pur
suit and. the lynching. ' Ranchmen and
cowboys In the vicinity are not" exerting
themselves to get the details, preferring
to refrain from too much curiosity. â¢
Early last evening Â¦ "Broncho Steve,"
who is foreman of the 'Sahuarlto ranch,
twenty miles south of Tucson, saw a band
of cowboys pass his ranch, riding swiftly
in the direction of Tucson. The foreman's
suspicions were aroused^when they, passed
him without utterinB>a*word. â¢ Cowboys
seldom ride hard without' yelling. Steve
decided to saddle ; his horse and follow
them, which he did at an early hour this
morning. , .';."-
Body Swinging to a Limb.
At Hart's ranch Steve found a crowd of
cowboys standing -.about the t body of'a
man swinging* to the' limb of ! a' mesquite
tree. He was a stranger to the .cowboys
in that^; section and* mystery surrounded
the affair until j^roncho^ Steve", arrived
and told'^of Â¦ tiavingr seen I the .' posse .the
night .before. His information made It
plain" that the man. was a horsethlef, who
had been pursued I and caught by. cowboys
working upon a ranch farther, south! The
lynched man was later found to be' Ignacio
Rivera; this name being written on several
letters in his pockets. Rivera wasa Mex r
lean vaquero' and was this afternoon 'iden
tified as a cowboy who had been working
at a ranch-near the border line for some
time. ' . Â¦ Â¦. . f- Â¦'.. _.' i
Cowboys at Hart's ranch, who heard
the pursuing band arrive, heard several
shots and saw a band of horsemen ap
proach in the darkness. They did not care
to inquire, into the â¢ shooting, but j one 'of
them ventured close enough to distin
guish the forms "of the horsemen and saw
that one man In the crowd was apparently
held by a rope about his* body, as though
he had been lassoed, and was emptying
his six-shooter at the party which had
come upon him.
Rope the Horsethief.
Evidently, the posse did not care to
shoot Rivera, for the cowboys at Hart's
ranch say that all the shooting was done
by j the man who was afterward , hanged.
The cowboys In the attacking party rode
about their man as though . they 'were
trying to rope him so as . to fasten his
arms to his .body and prevent him using
his six-shooter. This they succeeded' In
doing before Rivera could do any damage
to : the .' lynching party, and Rivera'\was
jerked to the ground and J dragged some
distance to a mesquite tree. The Hart's
ranch cowboys then attempted .to Inter-'
fere, 'seeing that It was 'a fight In which
one man was opposed by. a half. "dozen,
but . the lynching party drove them back,
and they were powerless to do anything, i
Rivera was placed - beneath a limb of
the tree, a rope was '.tightened ( about his
neck and thrown over the ljmb at a point
where the body. would swing free of the
ground. After hauling Rivera up they
tied the, rope about the tree.- Then the
lynching party rode' back to' the ranch
house. I'
The cowboys were not aware until, this
morning of what had been the fate of the
man they' had seen . lassoed. They Â¦: knew
that there. had been a fight, but did not
know that it had preceded a lynching.

GIANT COMBINE OF OIL INTEREST!!
A feature of the organization that' la
also encouraging to oil men Is that it re
moves, the danger .of - great activity In
drilling. when the oil mnrkot clnos not cIp
mand it. Under ( the * old condition each
company impelled' to develop Its: land
rapidly, Â»but; under the: combination of dn
terests there will be. drilling of wells only
as fast' as 'the necessity for proving land'
or the market conditions demand.' A ranid
restoration of : the equilibrium of supply
and demand is, therefore, expected to fol
low. _; i- Â¦Â¦*.,.â¢Â¦Â¦'Â¦â¢..Â¦â¢â¢'Â¦ â¢ .. . Â¦ Â¦ ,

The former price -is'- discouraging, Â¦ while
$1 a barrel leaves a good margin. of profit

The Question of the future price of oil
has been entered Into quite fully In the
discussions between the members of the
combine and It is practically agreed that
tha price will be from CO to. 60 cents. as
soor. as the arrangements are perfected
for marketing oil, that price to prevail in
tho Kern County oil fields, < from which
the freight and switching charges to San
Francisco Bay points Is 47 cents a barrel,
making a total cost, dellvered.-of 97 cents
when the price in the field. is 50 cents. '.
That the Spreckels Sugar Refinery, peo
ple expect a still higher price in the near
future Is Indicated by the reported sale
to them by the Union Oil Company, of
Hrgh. Prices in Prospect.
In marketing the oil it -Is said to be the
plan to 'construct a pipe line to San Fran
cisco Bay, unless satisfactory rates can
be obtained from the railroads. It Is hoped
by the promoters of the company that
when the great bulk of the land In Kern
County is tied up and the combine stands
ready to make long-time contracts with
the railroads, the latter will not only
make a low freight rate, but that they will
supply the equipment necessary to handle
oil on a large scale, which they aro not
expected to do as long as they stand In
fcur of lofting the business. of transporting
oi*. through the building of pipe linen. Thus
the promoters. of the project believe the
transportation problem Â¦ may be worked
cut without the necessity of building â¢ a
pipe line.
The organization of the great combine
Is not sought on any line of mere con
tract to sell the oil for a series of years,
but for the combine to acquire the prop
erty of the various companies or the con
trolling interest In their stock, taking In
both the assets and liabilities of the vari
ous oil companies absorbed, and thus it
has become necessary to provide a fund.
One of the first tasks undertaken was to
engage a competent person to finance the
combine, and it is said that I. W. Hellman
has consented to do so, taking bonds to
the amount of $5,000,000, a sum considered
ample for equipping the combine for the
work It- has in hand.
Scheme of Organization.
all signed on long-term contracts, which
will not be used against- the interests of
the combine. The Los Angeles Oil Pro
ducers' Association will work in harmony
with the northern organization. The
Union Oil Company, the largest producer
in Southern California, is working â¢ In
hearty sympathy with the. movement,
while many of the smaller companies in
other fields will be In sympathy with the
combine. Through all these agencies, it
is claimed, there will not be more than 5
or 10 per cent of the product of the State
on the open market in possible antag
onism to the combine.

?'Actions speak louder than words. Why
not apply it. to Admiral Schley? As a
Spaniard I look upon that .war as being
as unjust as the war which England is
now waging against the Boer republics.
"Schley impressed me as a gallant olll
cer and a high-minded gentloman. The
naval battle of Santiago was short and
decisiveâ so short that there was no time
for any exchange of compliments; so de
cisive that I can hardly believe that cow
ardice was thinkable. Tho fight was over
in about three hours and three quarters.
Had I been captured In the days of an
cient Rome my back might have been
used as a stepping place for the con
queror in mounting his horse.
"Admiral Schley treated me on terms of
absolute equality. His nagshlp.was west
In the blockading line, and was therefore
most exposed. She was engaged in a run
ning fight with the Viscaya and the Colon.
"When the Brooklyn and the Oregon
got within range of the Colon they opened
tire and the latter was compelled to run
ashore. The Cristobal Colon also struck
her colors to" the "Brooklyn and the Ore
gon. Â¦ -,Â¦*.
"The Brooklyn, holding the westward ]
blockading position, was within the range
pf our ships and batteries all the time,
though our -ships lacked certain things
necessary for lull effectiveness. Admiral
Schley. 'showed ability and thoroughness."

was In anyway concerned with the con
troversy refuse to discuss any phase of
the affair.
But one who was on the Brooklyn dur
ing the battle gave in a personal conver
sation this graphic description of 'the
scene immediately after tho vessel had
completed her famous loop: , -.
"As we straightened out on the course
parallel with that of the enemy.'* he said,
"I noticed that we' had three of the Span
ish ships in line abreast, the leading ves
sel being off our starboard bow. Every
gun of the Brooklyn's starboard battery
was blazing and the smoke from them
hid everything astern. I looked around
to see what our other ships were 'doing,
but could see. none of them, rolling
clouds of smoke from our guns obscuring
everything astern and to a point well for
ward of our starboard quarter. 1 * ' '
"I turned to Captain Cook, who was
standing near and said: 'We are pretty
lonesome out here.' He glared back, and
Just them we" both saw what first looked
like a small tidal wave, a ridge of water
with foam boiling about it. As wo starod
at tha apparition, which came out of fog
like emoko lying on our starboard quar
ter, the great gray bows of a battleship
came into view nnd we knew that tho
wave which hnd puzzled us was tho bow
wave which the Oregon was carrying In
her whirlwind rush for the cnomy. The
thunder of our own guns had drowned
tho crashing l-.rondsldcs of that -splendid
battleship and not until thorn did we
know that the Oregon was anywhero near
us."
NEWPORT, R. I., July 27.â The state
ment made by CaDtaln Francis A. Cook
in which he unequivocally denounces as
"outrageously Incorrect" the charges
that the Brooklyn In turning ran two
miles to the southward, continues to at
tract much attention from naval officers
here. These have not been slow to recog
nize the Importance of that statement,
for If It can bÂ« proved that the Hrooklyn
turned an quickly as her tuctical diameter
would permit, and which her commander
now asserts that she did. the whole fab
ric of accusation against Admlrul Schley
for a "caitiff night" during tho buttle
must come tumbling back upon the heads
of his accusers. Moreover, If Captain
Cook's claim Is proved, naval otticers
here pay, it will. reduce to insignificance
the tenth paragraph of Secretary Long's
precept to the court of Inquiry, the ono
involving a colloquy between Schley and
the Brooklyn's navigator, Lieutenant
Commanded A. C. Hodgson, and the "put
your help to port" order of one and "you
mean to starboard." the reply of the
other, will Iofo the importance which
hitherto attached to this alleged convert
sation. Captain Cook to-day refused to
amplify his statement, and said that he
must decline to say anything more on the
vubject.
Lieutenant Commander Hodgson, who
Is now stationed here, at llrst positively
refused to say a word for publication, but
after It had been pointed out that his
former commanding officer had made a
statement, he consented, although with
evident reluctance to appear in print, and
substantiated Captain Cook's statement
in positive sentences.
"X was on the bridge of the Brooklyn,"
he said, "and therefore had full oppor
tunity of observing all that was going on.
"To my personal knowledge, the helm
was kept hard aport during the whole
time of turning until eased to parallel the
course of the .Viscaya, then about
twenty-eight hundred yards away on the
starboard side. As the Brooklyn's tacti
cal diameter is only about COO yards she
therefore could not have run farther than
C03 yards to the southward." Â«j
As some other witnesses of the : Brook
lyn's maneuver have estimated the dis
tance she ran to southward all the way
from two to five miles, it will be at once
recognized how Extremely important for
Schley's case Is the recent statement of
Captain Cook and -this supporting testi
mony of his navigating officer.

NEW YORK, July 27.â The election
announced for tho first tlmo to
day of Alvln \V. Krech and Gen
eral Thoirms Kckert as members
. of the bonrd of directors of tho
Union Pacific Rnilrond marks n very Im
portant utep In the development of the
great alliance between the Gould railways
and tho roads controlled -by the Harrl
man-Rockefollcr-Kuhn-Locb syndicate. It
also disposes of the etory that in carry
ing out the harmony plan between J. .P.
Morgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. the
former firm was to have a representative
in the Union Pacific board.
Both Krech and General Eckert are rep

Mercantile Trust Company, whose presi
dent is General Louis T. Fitzgerald, and is
also a director In the Missouri Pacific.
Krech is also a director In the Wheeling
and Lake Erie, the control of which has
recently passed into the hands of -the
Goulds. Â¦
The harmony which prevails In ths
Northwest does not as yet extend to the
Eastern roads in which J. ' P. Morgan &
Co. and the Gould-Harrlman-Rockefeller
syndicate are Interested. George Gould
still has his eye on the Lackawanna, ami

If you do not derive prompt and satisfactory results from the use of Peruna, write at once to Dr. Hartman^

Fire Department, So. Evanston, 111.*
writes:
"/ began taking Peruna last fall
for bladder and stomach trouble. As
it seemed io relieve me I kept it up
until, now I am glad to say it has
completely cured me. â¢gÂ£ p i\ft B h Â«J
and whenever any of the boys receive a
drenching at a fire they take a dose or
two which keeps away any bad after-
effect*)."â Capt. C. Harms, South Evans*
ton, 111.
MR, JOHN SWEETING, Captain
Fire Department of Evanston, HI.,
says:
"Some time ago we had such con-
tinual hard service that I, as well
as my . men, was completely ex-
hausted and felt my nerves giving way.
One of our men had tried Peruna & couple
of years ago and he advised us to try it.
We did so and found the chango simply
marvelous. 4 dose seemed bansr than
a meal, and in ten days we were all
feeling fine."â John Sweeting.
MR. WM. SUMPTER, Lieutenant
Truck Co. No. 1, Fire Department,
Evanston, 111., writes:
"Peruna cured me offkldney trouble of
nearly six years .standing. I became so
weak that I was unable to endure any
extra strain without serious pain. Some
of the firemen had been. 'taking Pe-
runa, and as It had helped them I
thought It might 'help me. It not only
helped me, but It cured me In no time..
Fiva bottles made a now man of me,
and three more restored me to per-
feet health." â-Wm. Sumpter,

The visitor to the national capital who
has seen the Washington monument onlv
once has just begun to see it. A plain,
unadorned obelisk, it would appear the
simplest object In the world, but, In fact,
it is a3 changeable as the clouds. Never
Is It twice the same. Every change in
the point of view reveals the monument
in a new phase. It is a chameleon to the
weather. Go .close to it, and its walls
seem to rise abruptly to a height that is
overpowering. Sail down the Potomac,
and the thinly gleaming white shaft seems
to be waving a graceful farewell. Often
it is gray and solemn, a part of the every
day world of work and duty.' Sometimes
in the varying lights it loses Its perspect
ive and is a flat outline against the sky;
again, each line will stand forth with the
crisp clearness of an intensified photo
graph. In the early morning It is beauti
ful in the first rays of the rising sun; on
a moonlighted night it Is like a thing from
another world, cold, gleaming, unreal.
Many times in the course of a season the
sharp point is lost In clouds, and the
shaft ' rises like a pillar supporting the
firmament: The setting sun. paints 'the
monument with Its most brilliant hues,
and its last rays are reflected from. the
gleaming tip. At night, under the star
light, the shaft is solemn like a sentinel.
In storm it stands as a type of all that is
steadfast. In the clearness of a bright
bright summer, day It seems tremulous In
the pulsing air. 'Always the same, yet al
ways different, it is like a thing with life,
a personality, to be known and loved. It
has relatively little for the passing stran
ger, but many confidences for the old ac
quaintance.âNew York Evening Post. 1

Oriental trade. The steamers will work
in conjunction with the. road and be prac

THERE is no beer trust. Nobody
will trust you for beer. Also, the
brewers say there is none, and the
brewers should know, because
they have made the combination
that has put up the price of that humble
quencherâ steam beer.
Nevertheless, beer is up, and while there
may be no- increase in the price of a
glass of pellucid amber there is the dread
promise that the schooners that come over
the bar will be of so much lighter draught
hereafter that the fleet must be materially
increased to meet the needs of .commerce. â¢
There is a great and parching drought.
The brewers have raised the price of beer
to $6 50 for barrels, $3 25 for half-barrels, '
J2 25 for third-barrels and $125 for sixth-;
barrels â a general raise of 33 1-3 per cent. .

eral has been obliged to Issue an order
directing that the rolls and reports of the
annual musters and inspections held at
the camp be forwarded at one* to head
quarters; also that aJl proper outstand

transmitted without further delay. There
1e also an order for the immediate trans
mission of reports of practice inarches
during the camp week, together with an
note books, engineering notes,' sketches,
maps and Information . relative to the
marches. The commanders are all anxious
to enter upon the discharge of duties, but
from these orders, It Is apparent that they
are slow In making the returns of what
was accomplished. ....
Captain Cheda 6t Company D, Fifth
Regiment, has been re-elected command-
Ing .officer of 'the company.
George B. Caldwell has been ! commis
sioned a second lieutenant of the same
regiment and will be assigned to a duty
yet to be determined.
The commanding officer of the Fifth In
fantry has Issued orders relative to tar
get practice. There is a desire to discon
tinue the custom of monthly target prac
tice at 200 yards and to require the men
to shoot at 200, 300 and 500 yards, as laid
down by the regulations, as" it is believed
that practice at the three distances only
on the occasion of the State shoots, twice
a year, is not enough to perfect the men
in shooting at the greater distances. It
is believed that shooting every month at
200 yards is not conducive to first-class
marksmanship. *
Charles H. Holmes, first lieutenant ot
Company E of the Fifth, has been elected
captain of the company, W. Claypool, sec
ond leutenant, has been advanced to
first lieutenant and Charles Kohler has
been elected second lieutenant.
J. Whitney, formerly sergeant major of
the old Second Artillery, has enlisted as
a private In Battery D of the artillery
battalion, Captain Cunningham.
An effort is being made to have the com
panies of the Sixth Infantry engage in a
competitive drill for the purpose of cre
ating an enthusiasm, which at this time
is said to be wanting. It Is the Idea of
F. A. Spence of Company B, -who is the
promoter of the scheme, to have at first
such drills in each of the three battalions
and then have the best in each compete

Tha National Guard companies of Stock
ton have for some time been without a
rifle range, because the one that was at
Goodwatar Grove was destroyed by fire.
An effort is being made to establish a new
range in the immediate vicinity of the
one destroyed and to secure a locality
where a 600-yard range can be estab
lished.
In the first battalion of artillery seven
men have been discharged from the serv
ice, seven on account of removal and one
for the good of the service.
On recommendation of the battery com
manders, and good cause being shown
therefor,- the following-named "non-coms"
have been reduced to the ranks: Corporal
Harry TV. Fawke, Battery C, and Corpo
ral John A. Devany, Battery D.
At his own request Quartermaster Ser
geant Willis F. Unfred. Battery C. was
relieved from duty as quartermaster ser
geant of Battery C. Corporal Ward D.
Grant was promoted sergeant and detail
ed to fill the vacancy.
The organizatloh will have battalion drill
to-morrow night.
- Captain Nearny of the Xaval Militia has
obtained from the United States Navy De
partment a 36-f oot steam cutter for J the
use of the militia. It is a new vessel and
will be delivered in a few days. The car
rying capacity of the cutter is 63 men and
250 pounds of provisions and water. . As
soon as the cutter shall have been turned
over to the commander the militia will
commence a series of boat drills.
Captain Phelps. U. S. N.. has made a
careful Inspection of the Marion and has
forwarded his report to the Navy De

stood that he reports finding the vessel in
better condition' at this time than she
has been at any time since she was turned

had no faith in palmistry or clairvoyance,
and had come to be convinced either one
Â¦way or the other. Ismar began that easy
flow of language of hers, and half an hour
afterward the cynic left her room
wrrathed In smiles. He afterward said:
"That woman is certainly a wonder. The
way she sailed into my business affairs
and told me of my past lifeâ a thousand
times better than I could myself In that
length of timeâ is more than remarkable.
She told me of changes I have been con-
templating and advised me to make them.
She told me of family affairs that were
simply astonishing'. She also diagnosed
my physical condition and correctly
named the cause of my ailment. I shall
follow her advice and try to get well. She
certainly is all she claims to be, and I
Â¦unhesitatingly recommend her to all that
â¢wish to seek her aid and advice." The
evidence of those who have called on

Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and nutrition, and
so cures disease of other organs which
have originated through deficient nutri-

"I had been suffering with kidney trouble
twenty years," writes Miss Minnie Ryan, of
1537 Louisiana Avenue, St. Louis, Mo., "and I
had doctored with a number of the best physi-
cians. Two vears ago I commenced taking your
'Golden Medical Discov|ry' and 'Favorite Pre-
scription ' and took also several vials of Doctor
Pieree's Pellets. I took eight bottles (four of
each), and I feel now perfectly cured." j

What to Do.
There Is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney remedy fulfills every
wish* in curing - rheumatism, pain in the
back, kidneys, liver, bladder and every part
of the urinary passage. It corrects inability
to hold water and scalding pain in passing
it, or bad effects following use of liquor,
wine or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant â¢
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the-riay, and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the extra-
ordinary effect of Swamp-Root Is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its won-
derful cures of the most distressing cases.'

Charge enough to cover two days (Blumbe)

hunts ever planned in the Northwest, and
ln three weeks will attempt to marshal
great numbers of farmers in \ Western
Washington in a gunning expedition after
the colonies of crows that infest the
Puget Sound country. Ailing and other
Northwestern sportsmen have discovered
that the crows are relentlessly destroying
broods of young Oriental game birds,
besides making sad havoc Of native birds'
nests by destroying the eggs. The crows
also keep sharp supervision over farms
and commit many depredations in barn
yards, and it has finally been decided to
try to drive them out of the State. Ailing
believes his hunt will so scare the crows

man has two brothers living in San Jose,
and they engaged Bert Herrington as at
torney to defend him. Herrington was
waiting at the Jail when Coronado was
brought in and at once advised him to>
keep his story to himself. Coronado.

into the brush and ran for his life. For a
time he heard the pursuer behind him. but
ln the darkness he easily made an escape
to the house of Benjamin Ortega, where
he told of the crime.
Ortega, an old man and alone in his
cabin, was afraid to venture out, and the
two remained. behind barricaded doors un
til dawn. Then the alarm was fflvenand
a telephone report sent here to the Sherinr
and Coroner. The body was found where
It had fallen, the pockets empty and
money, watch and rings gonci. Â¦
When the Sheriff arrived ait the scene
of the crime the trail of tiÂ»e murderer
was at once taken up and he was tracked
with some difficulty through the woods
up the mountain side. About a hundred
yards from the little cabin of Albert
Coronado the trail was lost. Sheriff Lang
ford and Deputies Bache and Carson made
Inquiries of Coronado and soon became
suspicious of the man. His stories of his
movements during the, preceding twenty
four hours were- contradictory, and his
statement that he had no . shotgun was
disproved after a short search . of the
house, when an old-fashioned muzzle
loading gun was found concealed between

At the annual session of the Interna
tional Mining Congress, which has just
closed at Boise, Idaho, a long forward
step was taken by the adoption of a rec
ommendation for the formation of
branches of the congress in all the States
for the purpose of promoting the estab
lishment of a bureau of mining by the
National Government. .The matter has
been presented to the people of the mining
States on the Pacific Coast, where the
necessity for the bureau is evident. The
hard work, will be to interest the non
mining States, but these are much less
numerous than they were a few years
ago, the exploitation of mineral resources
In nearly all parts of the country having
been rapid and extensive. '.The miners of,
the Pacific Coast, who have long worked
for recognition of their, industry at Wash
ington, will be pleased with anything that
can bring the day of the establishment
of the mining department nearer.
The Assessors and mine-owners have
been busy all over the State recently dis
cussing the valuation, of, mining proper
ties for. the purposes of taxation. The
Mining and Scientific Press takes the
ground that as a mine is not a reproduc
ive property and its yield of metal is not
reproductive in' the same sense/ that "a
yield of agricultural or pastoral products
is, and as taxation of mines can. absorb
the land, mine taxation should deal with
mine production rather than with mines,'
mining lands or mining tools. The Mining
Press furnishes some carefully compiled
facts concerning, the- taxation " of : mines
abroad and says: . ,. _
Great Britain, to recover the cost of the .war
with the Transvaal, has announced an intention
of assessing a royalty on the gold production of
Mining. Properties Active.

on far higher relative assessments of valuation.

there was no protest at what would reasonably
seem an absurd inequality in comparative val
uation for taxation. -;."Y â¢

exacts 20 per cent royalty of the gross gold

royalty rates on the gross gold yield Â¦ up . to 20
per cent. One concession made ; the royalty on
all metals and coal 20 per cent. The Nether

* Outlook for a Rise.
The Bakersfield Californian is convinced
that the price of oil will soon . rise. It
says that a man offered to contract at
Bakersneld for 5000 barrels of oil per
month at the rate of 25 cents per barrel,
but he received no encouragement from
the well owners. . The same paper reports
that companies that have, owing to
straitened finances, been compelled to
market their oil that was stored up have
placed their contracts and a majority of
the remaining companies have no oil to
sell at the present prices.
The Western Oil Association has em
ployed a man to look over Its lands in
the Bitterwater district In San Benlto
County and to select a site for a well.

The sale of stock off the floor of the
Los Angeles Exchange by brokers has be
come a matter of such common occur
rence that there is much talk about it In
the City of the Angels. There were two
days recently on which not a share of
stock was sold on the floor of the ex
change. All the transactions that took
place were carried on outside. According
to the Los Angeles Herald, the prices in
the private sales have been far wide of
the mark set by the quotations in the
exchange, and as a consequence the pub
lished figures have given little idea of the
actual values of stocks In trading. The
outside sales are in violation of the rules
that are supposed to control the brokers
of the board. ,
Oil is reported to have been found at
Hiawatha, near Victor. The drill, as the
reports run, went down 700 feet to oil.

A furnace has been established at Los

An agreement of which some, mention
has been previously made in The Call is
in circulation in the Kern River district,
and the Bakersfield Californian reports
that some signatures have, been received.
The substantial part of 'the plan is to
consolidate all the oil companies of Kern
County into a corporation, with a capital
stock ef $75,000,000. The most interesting
part of the agreement is contained in one
paragraph, which is as follows:
Each present owner shall be solicited to ex
ecute an agreement of sale or "option " or
eraLnt deed, which, in the can of incorporation,
ehall be accompanied with the statutory con
sent of the stockholders, granting unto the
r.ew corporation for the period of seven moaths
from the date the privilege of purchasing all
property of eucd owners, and In the event it is j
desirable to purchase the stock of any cor- i
poration the price to be paid for said stock I
shall be arrived at by appraisement in the
tame manner as if the whole property were
purchased.
Another paragraph provides that the
cost of producing oil in the Kern River
district shall be estimated "at 25 cents per
barrel by all the subscribers to the agree
ment.

Plans for Combine.
The attempts of the oil men to solve .he
various problems that have been forced
vpon them- by reckless competition, high
freight rates and other causes contiaue.
Meanwhile the new methods that may
make the demand for the output sufficient
to solve certain difficulties are awaiting
final action. There is a general agxeenient
on all sides that only combination can put
the oil industry in the best position. The
work of development has very naturally
not been pushed as vigorously as was the
case a few months ago. for the owners
are waiting to see what it is advisable for
them to do. Oil fuel is so cheap even
"when the well owners receive a fair price
for it that there is no danger that there
Â¦will be any falling off in the demand, for
the ratio over coal In cost at a fair price
for oil remains fully three to one. The
probability is that there will be a very
different condition of affairs in the com
ing: year.

This action is the result of the dissolving

the status of the $7000 advanced by
merchant creditors . to the teachers in
March. 1900. About 400 teachers were paid
previous to the filing of , injunction proÂ»

As showing the increase in ocean facilities drawn. here to carry this increased commerce,

Only neglect of opportunity and. failure of enterprise can lose us our lead. As for our am
bitious rivals, the prospective increase in the Pacific trade will furnish them opportunities com-,
mensurate with their facilities, position and enterprise, and they will be members of a great family
of cities here, of which San Francisco will be the patriarch.

Aside from our advantage of hhrbor and inland transport atioiv by ! ail and water, this city
is at the edge of a productive field that is unlimited, almost, in its capacity to produce-whit the
world wants, from the soil. This '.will be the world's greatest market for fruit products, of all;,
kinds that can grow under temperate zone and , semi-tropical conditions. It will be all: that
Palermo is in citrus fruits, Marseilles in oil and wine, Paris in glassed goods, Valencia in raisins
and Glasgow in pulps and jams. The volume of each commercial specialty in each of those centers
will be more than aggregated here. It is, too, a production, in which we have no rival in the
world, and that iiT^plies its permanent .primacy.. Other condition's' change, but. the soil and,sun
shine are stable elements in production that nothing can change. The profits of this vast produc-/
tion that is at our doors will flow into oilier channelsof enterprise, create other- industries, sup
plement the natural; with the artificial, and be a foundation which will! bear* a .superstructure tlieV
nobility of. which .will be limited only by the enterprise and good taste of our people. ,''
The young .man '.'. who |is now getting a foothold m" ..any produciive business in California is Â¦

will make his first appearance here as a
conductor of grand opera, and from his
achievements in light opera so far there
Is everything to be hoped from his efforts.
Mr. Stelndorff is very hopeful of the work
of the orchestra and chorus. The chorus

added. The orchestra Is also enlarged,

â¢warrants one In saying that the principal

abilities are well known here, and though

TO-MORROW evening Frederick Mc-
Greer's handsome new curtain rings
up at the Tivoll on the initial pro
duction of the grand opera season
of 1901, "Aida," the operatic ancient
of days and time-honored opening bill. It
would hardly seem proper to begin the
eeaeon with anything else, even to the
audience, and with managers and singers
"Aida" has become a superstition as a
mascot opening. Not that one minds, for
"Aida" Is a delightful opera, but its In
variable appearance as the initial offering
of a season savors of the comical. One
begins to wonder what would happen if
another opera were substituted, some
thing new. to be violently original; but
perhaps that would be tempting the foot
light fates too far.
At any rate this year they are to be
appeased and we to be pleased by "Aida"

slcal usefulness has served to draw at
tention strongly to the possibilities of the
organ as a eolo Instrument, through. the
numerous recitals that have been given on
the Stanford memorial organ during the
convention. Attention has also been
called to the fact that though San Fran
cisco Is to lose the valuable services of
Dr. H. J. Stewart, who leaves Trinity
Church for an appreciative 53000 position
in Boston, we have In Mr. W. B. King
an organist amply qualified to take . his
place. Mr. King's achievements In chorus
accompaniment during" the convention
will not be readily forgotten, and his solo
work, with Its clean, crisp technique, large
grasp and thoroughly musical spirit. Is no
less brilliant. The young organist, for he
is still quite young, has also a thorough
ly artistic repertoire. In which' are to be
found most things worthy from Bach to
WIdor, whose pupil he was^-WIdor, I nat
urally meanâ during* a\twp years' stay in
Paris. The First Congregational Church
of Oakland is Mr. King's stronghold, and
if you go there you are likely to hear
some music, though the organ is only in
differently good.
Dr. Stewart will give a farewell recital

those ten, twenty and thirty cent raree
shows ', that used to be held In Â¦ that un
' syndicated basement, where he was box

Goodwin and Maxlne Elliott appeared on

he is undisgulsedly â¢ proud, too. of being

more, in September next. Fred
erick Warde will bring out a
flve-act tragedy by Miss Vlrna
Woods, a clever young -woman,
who has written a good deal, of one kind
or another, and who is a Sacramento
Callfornlan.
Miss "Woods* tragedy has been In Mr.
Warde's possession for something like a
year, and its presentation was promised
at a much earlier date. It will be placed
in Mr. Warde's repertoire for the com
ing season and is to be seen In San Fran
cisco in January next. The author will
attend the Baltimore,' rehearsals *uid wi'f
shortly leave California for tfce purpose*.
Miss Woods' choice of subject is pecu
liar and interesting. Her central figure is
Horatiusâ not the famous Roman who
has so long "kept the bridge" at com
mencement exercisesâ from whom the play
takes its name, and who turns out to
have several claims to consideration as a
tragedy hero. He Is Horatius of 700 B. C.
one of the combatants In the celebrated
battle of the Horatii and Curiatll, in which
the bloodthirsty Romans antedated by
years two thousand odd the French gris
ette's famous conception in the farewell
song to her soldier lover:
"Let those who make the quarrels
Be the only ones to nght."
It will be remembered that the bosses
of that particular battle, with a gleam of
the Inspired righteousness that occasion
ally attacks rulers, agreed to fight it out
among themselves' to save useless blood
shed. Accordingly, they chose three on
a side, with a vow to stand pat on the
result of the triple combat," in which, after
Olympic heats, Horatius was left sole sur
vivor, with a consequent victory for the
Horatian governmental trust. Also, If I
remembeÂ© aright, the hero in question did
away with his sister in picturesque fash
ion on account of her most natural love
for one of the enemies of her house,
which, by the way,- furnishes the love
interest of the play.
The scenes of the tragedy, in all five,
are. laid in and about Rome, and of course
blank verse is the form of its expression.
Concerned with Mr. Warde in its produc
tion will be Charles D. Herman, Barry
Johnstone, Antoinette Ashton, May
Warde and Virginia Drew Trescott. Mr.
Warde is' having special scenery painted
for the piece. There is a lively curiosity
among Eastern critics to see Miss Woods'
.play, for the label "Calif ornian," connect
ed with dramatic interests, as with
peaches. Is rapidly becoming synonymous
for something good. ."* Â¦ . > ;
As a rule in strike contests the kernel is hidden by the husk. The kernel is an is.sue that
usually involves sincerely the dearest rights and interests of labor, but the husk is the legal irre
sponsibility of the labor organization. That organization may wreck the employer's truck, even
when driven by himself, and the act is the use of irresponsible force.against responsible prop
erty. His only remedy is an appeal to the criminal law. Perishable freight is unloaded on the
docks by the distant producer under the implied contract with the hauler set up in the law of
common carriers, and further accented by the exaction of a license from the hauler. This whole
system of obligations and implied contracts is broken, and the producer's property rots on the
dock. Third parties. are wronged, society is damaged, and there is no responsibility. If we are
really a civilized people there must be devised for these things a remedy that is respectful 01 all
rights of all people, and its beginning must naturally be perfect equality of responsibility.
his employes.
The establishment. of equality between employer and. employe, between labor and capital,
between the labor union and the corporation, would forever abolish the invoking of the criminal
law in labor controversies. The much complained of judicial injunction ., would disappear. The
existing heat on both sides would be cooled in the presence of the equal law.
Such a condition is so far from ideal that it cannot endure. Make responsibility equal
and the swarm of deputies of the civil officers and the armed soldiery will disappear. V In a hot
dispute the employer will not invoke force against force, because the union party 'to the dispute
must respond in penalty from its treasury, or by assessment 1 of its members for any damage done'
to his property, as he is compelled to respond for any financial or physical damage endured by
We say with a full and friendly knowledge of the situation that the unions suffer from
this condition of things. By the power of organization they can compel the making- of a contract
which nothing can compel them to keep, and for the breach of which they cannot be made to
respond. Labor and capital are equal partners in production. TJ?e dignity of each requires that
they be equal in all things. Capital makes a contract with the consumer to deliver to him at
a certain date a certain thing or aggregate of things, to be produced by labor. At the same
time labor and .capital make a contract, covering hours and wages! - Labor, in its present condi
tion of irresponsibility, may break its contract, "and so compel capital to break its contract with
the consumer. But capital is financially responsible, and the' consumer can enforce against it the
penalty clause of his contract. But when capital seeks to recoup its loss by enforcing its contract
with labor it finds behind it no responsibility! On the other' hand, every court in the land is open
for the enforcement by labor of its contract against defaulting capital. Â¦ It can collect damages for
any infraction as to hours or wages. . Intelligent mechanics and laborers will see at .once the
one-sided condition which this implies, and the ultimate loss of public sympathy, for powerful
organizations whose legal irresponsibility is equal to the damage they may inflict upon others.
This question of equalityof responsibility is rapidly coming ; to _ the front, and is destined .
to work a change the labor union system by advancing it to the higher plane of legal
and financial' responsibility. Complaint is. now made that in strikes and controversies between
unions and employers the latter resort to injimction and invoke the restraints of the criminal
law., A calm inquiry will find the reason for .this in the legal and financial irresponsibility of the
union. Labor unionism is itself brought into disrepute by the acts of its members who go to
extremes that would- not be thought of if the union were liable to an action in trespass for dam
ages. Injunction is sought and military power invoked because on one side is destructible prop
erty and legal responsibility,- and on the other organization and its power without responsibility.
: This statement illuminates 'Mr. O'Connell's" declaration that, the contract has not been
broken. But suppose he is right, and it is intact and carries with it the. power, to apply -equal
artificial conditions to the whole country, if He had broken it, how could he be held to legal're
sponsibility? . ' ,Â¦ .-- -'Â¦'â¢.Â¦Â¦
The reply made- to this is that the same- artificial conditions cannot- apply to the various
natural conditions affecting the machinists' trade. The conditions under) which the material and
its transportation may be had;" the cost and accessibility of fuel, the absorbing , capacity of the
nearest market, and other, things, natural and physical, are said to make identical artificial condi
tions a misfit. This is illustrated by the difference of conditions between this coast and the East.
This is so influential that it is said by men well informed that if artificial conditions here are
made arbitrarily identical with the East the machinist's trade will disappear as a California
industry. ' >'. , . . ' \ :Â¦:Â¦'Â¦
RECIPROCAL' RESPONSIBlLITy.
L . N issue of. interest- has developed in the machinists , strike. While it is apparently an issue \<
/\ of veracity between Mr. O'Gonnell and the chairman of the manufacturers' organization,
/â \ the real question is. far away from that. â¢ v : â¢
"T v It is alleged that the employing machinists a ->year; ago entered into a contract,
solicited by their employes, one condition of which was that differences should, be '. arbitrated, in
order to prevent just such a paralysis of trade as is now alarming the country.'? It is claimed -that,
the authorities which control the strikers. violated this agreement. To this Mr. O'Gonnell rejoins
that the employers want to arbitrate locally, whicli he will not permit, as he- demands that the
arbitration and settlement. cover the entire industry of the whole country on identical, terms. â¢

agreed to take it up. In a short time
$1,000 was subscribed and as much more
is in sight. It was then decided to go on
with the undertaking n
The coal question has hitherto been the
main obstacle in the navigation of the
upper waters of the Sacramento. Each
steamer haa to carry enough coal to bring
her home sfiid that took up nearly all the
space, leaving little room for freight. The
nev* towboats are to use oil as fuel, how
ever, and the oil men have agreed to de
liver the stuff at whatever points are
agreed upon on the Sacramento. Tho
barges are each to have a capacity of 400
tons and the rate is to be not more than
$150 per ton from all points on the Sac
ramento to Port Costa. The fleet will
probably be built by Matthew Turner at
Jlenlela.
"We expect to be ready to begin carry
ing freight In six months." said Captain
Hatch yesterday. "The Southern Factne

PILOT FRANK MURPHY RETIRES
After Forty Years of Active Service
He Gives Up the Sea,
At the next meeting of the Pilot Com
missioners a change will be made In the
personnel of the pilot force. Captain
Frank Murphy has decided to retire and
his place will be filled by the appointment
of Captain M. Anderson. â¢ ,
Of all the pilots now in commission Cap
tain Murphy Is perhaps the best known
and best liked. Quiet, unassuming, cour
teous nnd before all a past master In his
business, he has made friends wherever
he went. Some time ago he began to
suffer from rheumatism and not long ago
his wife died. Then he decided to retire
from active service, but every time he de
cided to senu in his resignation some
thing occurred to make him change his
mind. This time ho made up his mind
for good and last Thursday he went out
on the Lady Mine for his last cruise.
Captain Murphy was appointed a pilot
In July, 1S62, and during his thlrty-nlno
years of service he never had an acci
dent. His judgment Is unerring and ship
masters trust him Implicitly. Ho will be
missed on the front more than any man In
the service. .
Captain Anderson, who will succeed
Captain Murphy, is well known on the
coast. He has been in the service of
Charles Kelson and ths Charles Kelson
Company for the past fifteen years, and
during that time was master of tho
schooner Laura Pike, steamers Lakme.
Centennial and Charles Nelson. He Is a
skillful navigator, a clever seaman and
very popular among the shipping men.
It Is understood that the change will take
place next Thursday.
Will Race to Honolulu.
The barks Ivalulanl and Diamond Head
said the schooner Irene Vent to Â»ea in a
bunch yesterday. The two ' former are
going to race to Honolulu, but the Irene
par(cd company with them at the hendÂ»
und started up the coast for Port Gamble,
Â¦where she will load lumber. The Diamond
Head and Kalulanl both made lone runs
from the Islands to this port, tho former
taking twenty-two days and the latter
twenty-four days to cover ' tha distance.
Captain IVtorspn of - the Diamond Head
claims it was a fair and â¢ square race,
but. Captain Dabel of the- Kalu
lanl aeBerts It was a fluke, â¢ In
any *vent Peterson says he will
prove that his veasel won on her merits
by beating tho Kalulanl to Honolulu,
while Dabel asserts his vessel will beat
the Diamond Head by at least four days.
Both vessels were to have sailed at S p.
tn., but owing to seme of the freight beln*c
late it was two hours later before they
got away, They both towed to the light
ship and then had to. beat out. to *ea
against a stronar southwent breose. The
central invpreHaTon on' the front Is that
the Kalulanl will win the race.

anss McKenzie Protests to School
Board and Claims Still to Be
a Principal.
Miss Margaret McKenzie has addressed
a protest, through her attorneys, Camp
bell. Metson & Campbell and Henry E.
Hlghton. to Superintendent of Schools R.
H. Webster, Mrs. Mary Kincaid, Cecil "W.
Mark, John B. Casserly and Jamts Den
man, members of the Board of Educa
tion, against being dismissed from the
School Department. In the protest the
proceedings of the board are reviewed,
and Miss McICenzie says that when she
vacated the Hancock schoolhouse she
yielded to. the superior force then and
there exhibited. Through the action of
the board, she says, she is prevented from
resuming and performing her duties as
principal of the Hancock Grammar
School, but she if ready and has at all
times been ready to continue her ser
vices either as principal or in any other
position of enual rank and with the same
ealary attached to which she might be
assigned by the board; and she ho!ds her
self and has held herself subject to the
orders of the Superintendent of Schools.
Her protest, which is against the entire
proceedings, is based on the claim j that
the board had no jurisdiction or authority
tinder the laws of the State, and especiai
ly under the provisions of the existing
city charter, because the charges had not
been submitted nor had any complaints
relating thereto been submitted to the Su
perintendent of Schools, nor had he sub
mitted any of them to the Board of Edu
cation. She demands restoration to an
Â«Hjual position in the department, and no
tifies the members of the beard that she
is still principal of the Hancock School
and still in the service of the School De
partment, her ousting having been llle
pal. and that she will regularly demand*
the payment to her of the salary of prin
cipal of the Hancock School.

CONSTrrUTIONAXITT" OP;
civil* service nr issue
rolnt Baised That tha Delegation of
JVIuniclpnl Function to Commis
sion Is Invalid.
Attorney Joseph C. Campbell raited a
point before Judge Muraaky Friday In
the action instituted by Al kewUd against
Treasurer Brooks for the recovery of sal
arxÂ» as a special clerk In the offlw of thÂ«
TÂ»3t Collector thae may result in Â«. judsr
mont declaring unconstitutional all or the
civil service provisions of the charter and
leave the commission without an ofneo.
Lewald served as a special deputy In the
oRiee named for a lonsrer period than six
ty days, the tenure of service of special
clerks fixed by the charter.
In his argument Attorney Campbell,
who represents Lewald, stated that the
action of the Civil Service Commission In
certifying eligible* for the positions for
merly occupied by Lewald and tho other
deputies was based on authority which
the constitution prohibits. In tho consti
tution of the State It la provided that the
Legislature shall not have the power to
delegate to any commission the perform
ance of a municipal function. Mr. Camp
bell said that the act of the Legislature
In ratifying the charter delegated to the
Civil Service Commission the right to fix
the qualifications of certain municipal offi
cers. This act on" the part of the Legis
lature, Mr. Campbell urged, operated as
a delegation to a commission the perform
ance of a municipal function, and was
hence unconstitutional..
In event Judge Murasky holds that tho
power to fix the qualifications of certain
municipal officers is a delegation of a mu
nicipal function to the Civil Service Com
mission, the same Is Invalid and the civil
service provisions of the charter uncon
stitutional. Judge Muraaky has taken tho
case under advisement- and will file his
decision during the coming week.

trade and next year will see them
running between Colusa and Port Costa,
Some time ago the farmers of Colusa
and the upper Sacramento called upon
the managers of the railroad and asked
for a reduction In the rates now In ex
istence on wheat; oats and barley. They

Says Husband Was Cruel.
' Judge Murasky made an order Frir
day afternoon ' finally dissolving the in
junction prohibiting the payment _ to
teachers of moneys due. them for services
rendered during the months of November
and December, 1897. The teachers will
now be paid their money, but as the court
practically^ held that the merchant credi
tors of the School Department were en
titled to $7000 of the teachers' funds under
an agreement reached in ~ Jâ¢"*â¢ 0 !.?^'
the case at bar, in which all of the^teach
ers are joined as defendants, will be car
ried through to final decision and proba
ble judgment in favor or the ' merchant
creditors against the teachers individual
ly for such portions of the J7000 in ques
tion as each .was. paid under the tenns,of
Frank H. Powers, representing the mer
chants." < raised the Â¦ point Friday that
although the injunction restraining the
Auditor from auditing the demands or the
teachers against the fund had been dis
solved,' still â¢ the 1 injunction was , in full
force and effect. as against the teachers:.
Attorney Olney. representing the teach
ers, said that the contention .that the In
junction was still in force : and ' effect as
against 'the teachers -was not "sound, in
asmuch : as - the . court has already decider
that' the' agreement ', between the mer-r
chants and teachers : did ' not operate as
an equitable assignment . of the : $7000 'in
question by - thte ; teachers In favor, of the
merchant creditors.- Olney also contended
that the only j remedy in the hands of the
merchant ."; creditors ; was to i permit > the
teachers to cash their warrants and s then
force them ' Individually to s pay such ' por
tion ; of .the sum -of $7000 :asithey were
given when: the ?7000 was prorated among
the teachers. ' â¢. -".-. , . Â¦.:, J â¢

CAMP REVERIE, Forest\-111e,^July 2o.
"Camp Reverie," said Lieutenant Com
mander C. G. . Calkins, "combines all' the
attractions of a Bedouin encampment and
0, wardroom mess, 'with .the addition of
shade, fresh water and good society."
"It is a good place to grow young in.
I feel younger every day,", said Mrs.
Houghton of Berkeley. . : -J
"In '. my experience," said Mrs. H. G.
Crafts, the talented organist of Oakland,
"Camp Reverie is unique. In that its ad
vertising booklet, so far from exaggerat
ing its attractions, does not state half of
them. It has far exceeded my.- expecta- j
tlons and I am more than pleased.
"T find the mental atmosphere stimu
lating without, being oppressive," said Dr ;
R. L Hill Jr. of Oakland: "Its moral
tone is above comment, and my present
physical condition speaks for its cuisine."
The doctor, who came directly to Camp
Reverie after a very severe illness, is cer
tainly now the picture of health and can
tramp half a day without fatigue. There
are a number of small boys on the place
whose scientifically bandaged fingers and
limbs attest the skillful handling of the
genial doctor, for strange as it may seem,
the laws of force and gravitation hold
good at Camp Reverie as elsewhere, and
if the right amount . of strength is em
ployed in handling a knife it will cut a
finger as readily as a stick, and if the boy
hangs on to a dead limb something is
likely to drop. 1
"It is the best summer I have ever
had "" said- with one accord four small'
boys from San Francisco. Comparisons
are odious and the boys had sojourned at
many summer resorts, so I will not quote
further from their remarks.
"First of all," said Professor J. G. Lem
mon, "It is free from church fleas, and
then there are such fine opportunities for
botanizing."' j
"Hitherto," said Ida, Mansfield Wilson,
the - authoress, "I have agreed with St.
'Paul that the kingdom of , heaven, is with
in, but now I know it is at Camp Rev
erie."' , v . 'Â¦. â¢Â¦;â¢-';-
V'lt has an especial advantage in its cli
mate," said Judge: a. L. Frick, "which is
entirely free from ocean , winds and fogs.
,The .water, too, is much .warmer and con
sequently better adapted, for swimming
than that nearer the sea. It is-a beauti
ful spot and the management is excellent.
It Is just the place to come for a rest."; '.
."It is simply paradise. I have been here
five weeks and want to stay the season.
AU my friends know what. I think ofit,
too, for I Â¦Â¦ have not spared â¢. stationery in
singing its t praises," said Miss Kate
Thomas of San Francisco, well known In
literary circles for r her clever work in fic
tion. .

Edward Pearson. ?2 Bernard street.
swore to a complaint In Judgre Cabaniss"
court yesterday for the arrest of John T.
Hogan cn the charge of obtaining money
by false pretenses. It is alleged that Ho

print the transcript in a case to be ap
pealed to the Supreme Court in which
Pearson was the clalntJfT. nnd failed to do

arrested twice before on a similar charge.

Â¦â¢Â¦A dispatch from Scandia says that rain
has fallen 1 throughout the\ northern part
of the ; State this afternoon and con
tinuing generally this I evening, with the
best of prospects for a; heavy downpour
later in the night. ' ;
KANSAS CITY, July 27.â General rains,
which have fallen over the greater part cf
Western Missouri and Kansae in the past
twenty-four hours, have given this por
tion of the Southwest temporary relief
from the severe drought. Yesterday was
the twenty-fifth successive day In which
the maximum, temperature of the two
Stales had: ranged from lOO^degrees up.
Reports received at thti railroad head-*
quarters indicate that- the rains fell In the
western half^ of. Missouri and in nearly all
parts -of- Kansas with the exception of a
few liorthwestcrn counties. The fall was
heaviest between Kansas City and Maple
Hill. Kans., four counties west of herein
some places in the eastern half of Kan
sas the fall measured two and a ; half
inches. Good rains are, also reported
along: the MempMs railroad as far south
as Arkansas and as far east as the Miss
issippi River. Rain fell at' these points all
dayar.d iacoming down to-night.
It Is believed the rain will be of little
bensfit to corn. However, with. the most
favorable conditions from now on until
the ; er.d of the season late corn,, it is
thought, "will make a third of a crop. The
rains -Bill be of great benefit to pastures,
forage Â¦ crops Â¦ and fruit, and the belief is
expressed that Kansas may yet have
enough, hay to feed stock during the com
ing '/winter.-. ' â¢ . ' ' ' ,'Â¦
Frederick Wellhouse, one of the largest
apple growers In Kansas, is. authority for
the statement^ that apples in that State
will make almost -a full crop. Peaches,
grapes, and late varieties of fruit will
make an average crop, ' it is believed, if
conditions continue favorable. Oats and
potatoes in Kansas at least were beyond
help two -weeks before the rains came.
Kansas- City stockmen rejoice over, the
rains, â¢ and ? believe that Southwestern
farmers will now have enough grass to
feed their stock and will not have to rush
Immature cattle to market. This week's
receipts at the yards were the largest in
the history of the market, amounf.ng to
over 76,000 head. The cattlemen have been
without water or grass and have been
compelled to ship In their stock and sell
at any price or let them die. , i ir
TOPEKA, j Kans., July : 27.â Kansas has
been fully redeemed from the ravages of
the "drought. The -rain, which, started in
numerous portions of the State, last night
has been continued during the past day,
and ; reports received .nerei to-night, say
that rain is st!U fallintr in several nlaces
in the State. livery indication points to a
prolonged rain spell, which has been of
Inestimable value to Kansas.-,

Gray committed the burglary, and mur

the case and said he told the woman the

In an affidavit Gray says that at the

companion named Al Foyeiwere on their
way to Albany. Hearing of the murder,
they started the other way toward Boa

Some gossips maintain that religion was*
the cause that parted the loving twain,
but those who declare that is not the rea
son of the broken engagement offer as
evidence the gracious fashion in which
Mr. and Mrs." Heyneman welcomed the
young man and their very evident pleas

p Miss Heyneman's extreme youth is an
other, reason advanced as the;, cause of
the broken engagement,' but- as there was
. no reason for hurrying the wedding day
that argument is very . easily -puf; aside.
Whatever the cause is, the Heyriemans
will not speak of it, and. from Cincinnati
no explanation Is v offered." ' If Â¦ the be
trothal was annulled solely at the instance
of Miss Heyneman's parents, then- all that

Mr. Barrett has also estimated that ca
ble connection would increase the trade of
the Philippines 8W. per cent In fifteen
years; that the growth of all Asiatic trade
in ten years should amount of 50 per cent,
and that, in ten years, with a cable, there
ought to be an Increase of American busi
ness amounting, to $800,000,000.
Four surveys have been made from Cal

Nevertheless depths of between 3400 fath
oms must be- reckoned with, between
Guam and the Philippines. : The cost of a
cable via Hawaii to the Philippines is es
timated -at 510,000,000 by the president of
the Pacific Cable Company, of New Jersey*
The cost to Japan via Hawaii has been
figured- out by James A. Scrymser. presi
dent of the Pacific Cable Company of New
York, at $7,000,000. or $1034 per mile.
The trade which is carried on by coun
tries and ports, that would be connected
with San Francisco by cable is estimated
as follows by ex-Minister Barrett:. ...
Surveys to Hawaii.
Supposedly the Eastern men are making
inquiries in the interest of the "all.Amer
lean" route. Four routes have. been pro
posed for a trans-Pacific cable.- The on<
that has been most favored- by Americans
1b from San Francisco to the Philippine
Islands, via Hawaii. This calls for a cabl<
line 6640 miles long, as against 7986: miles
for the proposed British line, via Van
couver, Fanning Island, Fiji and Norfolt
Island to New Zealand, with a brand"
line from . Norfolk Island to Queensland
Americans have maintained the view thai
the line via San Francisco is the best be
cause It follows established trade, lines
and connects countries having large popu
lation and great existing trade.; The waj
stations on the proposed English line an
without much business, ' and that route
would be unlikely to get the bulk of thÂ«
patronage of North : America,; Europe
Australasia, India and Southern and.East
ern Asia, which is essential to its.com
plete success. Harrington Emerson, Â£
writer for the Engineering Magazine, has
pointed out that "the real prize in sight
is the transmission of the Asiatic busi-
Mr. Emerson found that the ideal trans
pacific route was the one- promising tc
secure the largest amount of present busi
ness, to develop the largest amount ol
new business, to ccst the least money tc
lay, to be laid and maintained most eas
ily'and cheaply, to be operated most rap
idly and with least interruption and to bÂ«
politically the most valuable. The pro
posed English line would in its firsi
stretch, from Vancouver to Fanning Isl
and" be 450 miles longer than any cable
yet laid and would be very costly to con
struct, besides being unpromising from t
commercial point of view.
3?our Routes for Iiine.
Â¦ : Two â¢ matters of " r . information j have
reached, this city concerning the long.dis
cussed trans-Pacific cable between .Sar
Francisco and; the Fa* ' East.. The . first
comes from Monterey, Eastern; men hav
ing been examining intoMhe subject oi
the feasibility of haying a cable , station
placed there. The 'other is ; received
through trade connections, and is to . thÂ«
effect that the people back of the wire
trust have so: much hope that thonext
Congress will take action on the matter
that they, have already prepared careful
estimates of the cost , of a cable, to â¢ be
made in San Francisco. They have ever
drawn working plans. They say that ii
would take a steamer with a carrying ca
pacity of 10,000 tons to ; carry , the cable
arid that a large plant would. have to be
constructed or employed at San Franciscc
to turn it out".- - ,_ ,_ â¢ ,_ * ]
The Eastern men who have been a1
Monterey acknowledged to an inquirei
that they were looking into the subject 6i
a station for a cable landing, but beyond
that they gave â¢ no information. Thej
have since gone from - Monterey and havt
not been definitely located to the time ol

The opportunity vo hear the beautiful'
Stanford memorial organ played by Dr. j
H. J. Stewart at the first of his two fare- p
well recitals that was given yesterday aft- j
ernoon at the Mechanics' Pavilion ' was â¢
eagerly and extensively taken advantage ;
of by' the public. Not since 'the fine organ !
at St. Ignatius Church was set upâ hard- j
ly even then â has so much interest been J
Fhown here in the matter of a pipe organ,
and every hearing, only further demon-]
mates the excellence of the Stanford in
strument, j
It was of course a double Interest that i
attracted the audience of yesterday, the I
opportunity of hearing the foremost or- j
ganist of San Francisco for almost the J
last time before his departure for Bos- Â»
ton. and to hear him -on an instrument]
w orthy of him. Both organist and organ
did themselves ample credit.
Since the removal of the Epwortn j
League millinery, banners and the UKe, tnÂ» ;
organ is heard to much better advantage, j
and Dr. Stewart's programme was well :
calculated to display its beauties and his J
own attainments. His opening- number \
was the tine sonata in D minor of Guil
manU, which was excellently given, the |
"Pastorale" in particular being notably j
charming In effect through its well-chosen |
registration. The "fÂ»*U organ" in it3 j
present voicingâ the instrument not being j
voiced for the Pavilionâ lacks strength.
Dubols' always popular "Cantllene Xup- I
tittle"' followed, and served to show the
bea-uty of the oboe stop and a fine, even
tremolo. The Dubois "Toccata" went not
quite so well, but the Grison "Commu- |
nion" in F, with Its opportunfty for dis- j
playing: the lovely, soft flute stop, was en
thusiastically encored.
Guihnant's fine "Marche Funchre" fol
lowed, with a truly splendid "building
up" effect, wherein the Stanford organ's
fine crescendo pedal doubtless came Into
play. I did not so well like the reglstra- Â¦
tion of the "Chant Seraphique" that fol- j
lowed in the ham movement that floats j
above the pedal melody, but the melody |
Itself came out with noble beauty. The j
ref-t of the programme was given over to j
transcriptions from piano and orchestral j
works, the Liszt "Consolation" and the i
Chopin "Polonaise" lending themselves
admirably to the translation. Three Wag- !
ner arrangements closed the interesting I
programme, "Wotan's Farewell" and |
"Magic Fire Scene." "Song of the Rhine ;
Maidens" &r.d the splendid "Kaiser
Msrch," before which Dr. Stewart intro
duced to the audience the builder of the
crfran, Murray M. Harris of Los Angeles,
who was received with friendly enthu
siasm.
Dr. Stewart expressed himself as highly
pleased with the org:an and will give on it
his last recital in San Francisco for some
time to come to-mornm evening at 8:15, j
{ when there will doubtless be another large i
aitdience to lake leave of one Â¦who has Â¦
eened music so faithfully for so long 1 In!

Food Cure I
NATURE'S
HEALTH REGAINED VIA FOOD.
A man may try all sorts of drugs to
help h'.ra to get we'l, but after all the
"food cure" is toe method Intended by
Nature.
Any one can prove the cfilcacy of the
food cure by making iise of the following
breakfast each rcornlnÂ£T for fifteen or
twenty days:
A dish containing not more than four
heaping teaspoonsful of Grape-Nuts,
enough good, rich cream to go with them,
some raw or cooked fruit, not more thaa
two alieos of entiie wheat bread and not
more than one cup of Postum Food Co f-
fee. to be slpppd. not drunk hurriedly.
Let thia suffice for the breakfast. . .
Let one meal in the day consist of an
abundance cf good meat, potato and "one
other vegetable.
This method will quickly prove the
valoe of the salection of the right kind
of foo<3 to rebuild the body andÂ» replace
the lost tissue which is destroyed ever;'
day and must be made up, or disease of
eon:e sort, enters In. This Is an age of
epeclalist*. and the above suggestions ar<j

who died in May, 1898. " J -' - f Â¦'.
Â¦ The : contest has been conducted princi
pally by Royal :.\V. Cud worth, a son. His
appeal to thef Supreme Court was that the
executor should receive but. half the usual
fee, in accordance with the law, which
states that such payment is lawful when
no labor is. involved In the . position ba
yond custody and distribution, and that
the personal property should be consid
ered as separate holdings, in which: the
widow should have no share. The execu
tor gave evidence to the amount of labor
which .'he had 1 performed' and the court
sustained his claim.* - â¢- "
' Young Ctfilworth showed that all his
father's money : hed been made previous
to his marriage, and was therefore not
community property. Mrs. Cudworth at
tempted , to prove that her own property
had been mingled with: that of the de
ceased, 1 and that the estate was in conse
quence shared ' equally betweerMhem. i The
court held,- however." to the -contrary, and
the â¢ personal t property, ! amounting I to $58,

GOUROCK.-July 27.â The Shamrock II,
accompanied by the Erin, sailed at 10:20
o'clock this morning for New. York. Great
enthusiasm was displayed as the chal
lenger departed.
Captain Sycamore desired to go under
canvas, and he was favored with a light
easterly wind, sufficient to keep the flags
streaming in the direction the yachts had
to sail. The challenger cut a. strange flg
ure with her Â¦ stunted spars and scanty
canvas as she ran ready to start. At 10
o'clock Sir Thomas Lipton and Watson,
the yacht's designer, boarded her,, and a
few minutes later the challenger's moor
ings were slipped, her headsails broken
out and- the Shamrock. II started on her
voyage across the Atlantic.
Thousands of people gathered along the
shore and on the pier, at Gourock and
greeted the yacht's departure with a great
outburst of cheering again and again re
newed. Hats and handkerchiefs were
waved, guns saluted and steam whistles
and sirens shrieked. The Shamrock's
crew were all mustered on deck, and, led
by Sir Thomas, gave a hearty response
to the greetings. For miles along" the
shore crowds occupied every vantage
point and the cheers -passed from group
to | group- until the challenger, with her
racing flag at the masthead and the Erin
with the Stars and Stripes flying at her
fore, disappeared from sight.-. Â¦
Sir Thomas Lipton remained aboard the
challenger I until she was off Curnbraes,
when he returned on a tug. Before leav
ing, he addressed the challenger's crew,
thanking them for what they had done
already and wishing â¢ them godspeed on
the voyage and a successful finish to their

Sacramento and Oakland J faced each
other in tbe greatest game of the season
yesterday afternoon at Recreation Park,
and the cranks who wef^? fortunate
enough to.be in: attendance; witnessed an
exhibition of the national game that' is
not likely to be. forgotten while baseball
is in vogue in this city. It was a contest
replete -with thrilling incidents, -such % as
long hits, double plays and errors at crit-'
ical perio'ds, and the game was nobody's
until "Dr." Mopkiman struck out at'the
end of the fourteenth inning, with two out
and as many on bases. The Senators car
ried off the laurels by the close score of
7 to 6. â¢
It was the Dudes' lot to suffer their
usual run' of hard luck, Arref lanes being
the offender this tim <S.., With two outvin
the ninth he tried to capture a fly which
belonged to Babbitt, made a rank error,
let in a run and the Legislators, encour
aged by this gain, fell onto a few ot ! Am
brose Hodson's curves, tying . the score
then and there. After this occurrence it
was nip and tuck for five extra rounds,
; until- Stricklett came- home with '.the -win
ning tally in the fourteenth. . . - ;
It was all Oakland up to the ninth. .The
Â¦DudesT bunched their hits on Doyle and
the fans looked pleased, for they thought
that Ewing's oripnles had at Uast lifted
the*hoodoo whlcl?. has hovered over them
for so - long and would win the game
hands down. Up to the ninth inning they
accumulated six runs, one being a four
cushion swipe over the" center field fence
by '."Truck" Eagan, bringing Strieb, who
was on first, in. - ? 'Â¦' . â¢ *
â¢ In the eighth Johnson, who was doing
good work, was retired in favor of Hod
son, 1 the twirler of journalistic fame. The
disaster" occurred rin -this, round, and poor
Ambrose has succeeded in placing the
Benedicks one- step further from the top.
Such- are the fortunes of baseball, but In
the meantime Hcdson should take an oath
never again to lift his pen to write about
baseball. "-â¢ - - ; Â¦ : â¢ "-Â¦ ...
Sacramento, made. its. grand splurge in
the ninth". Two were out' when Charley,
Doyle knocked 'an easy one to Babbitt's
territory. Arrollanes tried- to get it but
failed," letting McLaughlin in; and here
begins the story of jiow the champions
took possession of the game.' . "With two
men on bases Stricklett tore off a three
bagger, bringing them in. Stanley fol-:
lowed with: a .single, scoring .Stricklett
and tying the score. Sheehan, then, made
an easy out. ending the run getting for
flve more rounds.
Neither side could do anything more un
til Sacramento's half of the fourteenth
was reached. In this inning Doyle led off
with a single, but was. forced out at sec
ond on ' Stricklett' s easy- one. At this;
juncture Matt Stanley connected with the
sphere for three stations, Stricklett com
ing in and winning" the 'hard-fought bat,
tle f or .the lawmakers. Some were of the
opinion that Stricklett should have been
out at home, as Devereaux was standing
near the home plate and in a' small way
interfered with the ball. The- umpire,
however, thought different and the matter
was ended. The score: .

of malfeasance or neglect of duty in office.
But I in Informed by the Treasury Depart
ment that the duties of the office are effi
ciently and faithfully performed and that the
rating of the Collector's office compares most
favorably with that of any. Internal Ueve.nue

choning when compared â¢with the administra

President Cleveland and is a defaulter for a
large amount for which a suit Is now pending
against his bondsmen. The term, of the Col
lector of Internal Revenue Is not for any spe
cific length of time, but during the pleasure
of the President. I have not Joined Senator
Bard in asking ' the ' removal of . the present
Collector, for the reason that he has made a

pointed, not because he was my political

principal opponent for the position I now have'
the honor to bold. I <Jo not think It would be
showing proper courtesy to them to act'with

kins.
Senator Perkins ", was asked ' if - he- was
aware . of the â¢ fact vthat John'- C. Â¦ Lynch'
used ' the Â¦ power and .â¢ patronage - .' of . ; the
Collector's office in the last pollt-.

State j Senator ' In Â¦ the * Twenty-fifth J Dls-'
tnct, and Charles. M.". Belshaw, .the Re

he had heard something of Lynch oppos

lous.to-the , generally '< known â fact that
Lynch's deputies were* out early ; and late,

him during. the' last campaign to ask him
to use his Influence, as .United-States Sen
ator to "prevent "Lynch" and ? his-deputiÂ«s
from openly knifing straight out andrcsu-
The Senator replying, to questions said,
if' Lynch used such means to. help Burns '
his conduct was. not "honorable. When
the senior Senator was questioned as to
the political sense or propriety of retain-'
ingtn Federal office a man who. was guilty
of a dishonorable act he remarked that*
removal ought not to be made at this
time.; - , ' \'i&
Mever Sent tne Telegram. â¢ ".-â¢
Senator Perkins -answered that he re
ceived a- letter' from Assemblyman Bliss
touching^ this subject, but he did . not of
his own knowledge know that Lynch had
exhibited such a dispatch as coming from
himself. The Â¦â¢ Senator ~ also said frankly
that he never Bent a telegram advising his
friends to support Burns or any other
candidate for the United States Senate. ;
Never Sent the Telegram.
The - foregoing interview , fairly repre
sents what Senator Perkins desires to say
concerning the . public . career, of Revenue
Collector John C, Lynch. -What the Sen
ator is not particularly desirous of saying
la contained in this supplementary inter
view.'. â¢ â¢ , ' . '.-' .' ' Â¦'. -' . .
Senator Perkins was asked by some one
other than himself If he did not know
that Lynch 'deserted his post of duty as
Collector of Revenue and went to Sacra
mento to lobby and scheme to secure the
election of D. M. Burns to the.Senator
ship. The Senator replied: â¢
"I understand that- he went to Sacra
mento and worked. for Burns, i I under
stand also 'that Colonel John P. Irish left
hi$ Federal office to lobby at Washington,'
and I understand further that Federal of
ficeholders other than Lynch went to Sac
ramento to work for Senatorial candidates
of their preference. Some went to help
Grant and others. went to help Bard.". ..
â¢ When asked to name the'Federal office
holders "who went to Sacramento to help
elect" Senator Bard, Senator: Perkins
named Â¦ John P.- Jackson, -and â¢*Â¦ spoke of
.two from Southern California whose
names he *lid. not give. . .
Senator PerkinaÂ«was asked if he did not
know that Lyncn produced a writing- at

. My relations with Senator Bard and our
members of Congress are of the most. pleasant
and agreeable nature." They are all very cap
able, high-minded -and honorable- gentlemen
and any difference of a personal opinion about
a particular candidate will not create, the least
friction. We all work together for the general
welfare and prosperity of our . State. Â¦
recommending Is . a gentleman from Bakers
field, who we indorsed at the request of the
State Senators from Kern and Fresno counties.
I do not think It proper or right for repre
sentatives In Congress or other Federal offi
cers . to use their influence of patronage in
favor of or against, any State or municipal
'nomination, but : when the conventions have
made their selections It Is our duty as good
citizens to stand by the party and nominees

Recurring to Lynch's Incumbency, the
Senator, added: VI am' not committed ; to

if the President sends his name to the

not â¢ surprise , me' if the President should

been recommended to, him by many lead

.between/Senator Eard'and myself. He
holds that,Lynch's-removal should be im
mediate,,' and v I, am .not in .favor of .a
change at' this, time so soon 'after July i."
; In the gubernatorial contest the Sen
ator Is neither for nor : against anybody.
He â¢ says that he respects Gage as the
chief executive and entertains a high opin
ion of Flint, because the latter -voted -for
him for United States Senator. On these
points he said: - . â¢
,."I am not taking any part in the State
contest or the .municipal contest in San

the undoubted right to do as seems best
to him, but I hold, speaking -for myself
that I ought not, as a Senator, to inter
fere. Federal office holders, ; in my 1udg
meut, should not interfere in I State or
municipal campaigns. I , am not - flghtlfig
Gage or helping him. 'I am not fighting
Flint or helping him." .
The Senator's campaign for re-election
to the United States Senate . is clearly
outlined. He is not for anybody's elec
tion or removal. In short' he is -out for
Perkins and Perkins alone. | The Senator
does, not indorse the ' interference of thÂ«

When his opinion on this intrusion ..was

tering a forged telegram is a dishonor
able act and he recalls the receipt of a
telegram in Washington from Milton
Green at Sacramento wherein inquiry was
made if he (Perkins) had advised his
friends to support Burns.
The attitude of the senior Senator is
peculiar and inexplicable.:' If a" name
other than -his own had been- used, in the
bogus telegram . his Indifference might be
accounted for on the general assent "that
it makes no difference what happens if it
does net happen to me."- In this instance
his . own name was used . without his
knowledge or consent' and dishonestly
used- to defeat Senator Bard. The bogus
telegram was circulated at the extra ses

our business agent waited upon Mr. Morton of
the Morton Draying and Warehouse Company
and stated to him that . the Brotherhood of
Teamsters would refuse to- haul the baggage
of the Epworth League, as to haul it w.ould be
a violation of. the agreement between the
Draymen's Association and .the Brotherhood
of Teamsters,: besides being contrary' to the
constitution . of the former . body, as may be
seen from section 2. article 3. which reads as
follows: "It shall be the duty of each and all
members of this association to patronlzf a. fel
low member when they need extra teams, and
no member ef this asaoclation shall furnish
teams to any drayman who is not a member."
I We ' took this step - to avoid trouble with the
Draymen's. Association, as tbat - body had ; fre
quently complained of our members doing work
for the special delivery. Our business agent,
as agreed upon,, reported to Mr. Ren
ner the following 'Â¦ day, and - found Â¦ him
prepared to back-up' Mr. Morton If he
wished to make a fieht. He ' stated that he
Â»vould brine the matter I before the Draymen's
Association meetlnsr that night. The meeting
voted to sustain Morton in event that the lat
ter should insist upon hauling the Epworth
League baggage. . .
The business agent : of the â¢ teamsters then
waited upon Mr. Morton, who thereupon de
clared that he would haul the baggage, either
Â¦with union -or non-union men. The business
agent, seeing the probability of a conflict, then
watted upon â¢ Dr. Fllben, chairman of the re
ception committee of the Epworth League, and
asked him if he could turn the baggage into
other channels and in this way avoid the pos
sibility, of any delay to the guests of the clUy.
Mr. Filben replied that all arrangements had
bee'n made and that he could do nothing fur
ther'In the matter.
On the following Tuesday Mr. Morton in
structed his drivers to go to .the depot and
haul baggage, which they refused to do. .The
teamsters were immediately discharged. On
the evening of the same day we received the
following communication: Â» .

,To the oflicers and members of the Brother
hood of Teamstersâ Dear Sirs: You are hereby

of Teamsters instructed its business ugent to
interview Mr. Morton and try to have him re
instate the locked-out men, or, failing- in that,
to call out the other drivers in Morton's em
ploy, which latter step was finally taken.
'. That evening the Draymen's Association held
a special meeting to see what . could be done
to straighten out the matter. At that meet

out the 'information that there was entire
harmony between them and Â¦. the Dray

"strike" would last only until Monday,
being confident that the difficulty across

SHOOTS HERSELF
Trouble With Fruit Merchants
Regarding the situation of tha fruit mer
chants, after several conferences between the
Draymen's Association and the latter Â». sched
ule of rates of drayasre was arranged, which,;
however, was not satisfactory, to the dray-,
men. ' Thi3 dissatisfaction was the tauee of
continual friction between both parties. Again
the Brotherhood of Teamsteis was called .upon
to straighten out the mutter, which we did.
with the assistance of Mr. Kenner. ,More
trouble, however, arose among the members of
the association. .The Lewis Packing Company
refused to advance the rate of drayaae, dis
charged their teamsters and turned over their
work to- another member of the Draymen t
Association, Sam Linderman. DUsjrusion arose
between the draymen as to who had the right
to do the haulinc. the association ; contending
that the work belonged to Murphy &. Devlin.
As Linderman contended that he had a right
to do the hauling, charges were preferred
against him in the association and he was
found guilty of violating the rule that one i
member muat nof take the work of another!
at the same rate or. a lower rate. Mr. Lin
derman was asked to give up the work > or be
expelled. Llndorman saw that the power
against him was too great. He gave up the
work at the time, but in a few days bought,
out the work and teams of Harris Bpob, and.
the Lewis Packins Company, Â¦ which belonged
to Murphy & Devlin.
Some two weeks prior to the arrival of Ep
worth League in the city we were Informed
that the Morton Drayimr and Warehouse Com
pany had entered into an agreement with the
Morton Special Delivery, which was not a
member of the Draymen's Association, which
had refused to Join the association and over
which the association had no control, to haul
the baeKage of the Epworth League from the
depot to the Morton Special Delivery Com
pany's office on Taylor street for distribution.
The butlness aÂ«rent of the Brotherhood of
Teamsters was Instructed to confer with Mr.
Morton and notify htm that we could not haul
the bacgage for the Special Delivery Company.
Our agreement with the Draymen's Associa
tion provides that when any grievance arises
the manaser of the latter and our bunlnefs
agent shall confer and if possible settle the
matter. -This we did in thecaseof the dis
agreement over the baggage. of tha EpwortK
League. Mr. Â¦ Renner requested our.-^juslness
agent to to to Mr. Morton, who was always
looking for more privileges than any. other
member of the association, and report ; to him
(Mr. Renner) what he, had aaid. Accordingly.
Into the combination.' This proposal the broth
erhood refused to indorse.
With regard. to our revised rules and regula
tions,, which we were forced to adopt , because
of the abuses of overtime privileges, and the
discharge of barn stewards and drivers who
claimed . their : overtime, we decided .'to stop
these abuses by putting into effect a more
definite set of rules. .
These rules were rejected by the Draymen s
Association, which; however, agreed , to live
up to the old rules in the future, or until Oc
tober X, when they- would expire by limitation.
. At a later period the* Draymen's Association
asked the assistance of the brotherhood in set
ting the leather and commission merchants to
raise the rates of drayage. This the brother
hood refused to do. knowing that the prices
asked were unreasonable. . The firm of Gugen
heim & Co.. which refused to accede to the
demands of the. association, preferring to deal
with its draymen only. . continued to have its
hauling done at the old rate. -The leather firms
which refused to accede to the demands of the
association at that time were as follows: Brown
& Adams. S. H. Frank. W,.D. Sumner, Kuhl
man, Salz & Co.. and several others in the
hide and leather business.
The manager of the Draymen's Association
then asked us that In event of their failure to
secure an increase in the rate of drayage, we
should refuse absolutely to use any of the
leather manufactured by these firms. This
proposition was also promptly rejected by the_
Â¦ brotherhood. Â¦ â¢'
Another instance of the same kind relates
to the contract for haulin* to the Chutes new
butloins, which was awarded to John Tuttie,
who was not a member of the Draymen's As
sociation, and who was doing work which they
claimed belonged to the members of the- latter
body The association asked . the brotherhood
to interfere in its behalf. We interviewed the
architect, Mr. Lyons, and he decided to have
none but union teamsters haul to the build-^
tng Here a dispute arose, as â¢, to the hauling
of the cement. Jacobs & Co. had an option
on this hauling and agreed tpsublet the work
to the Stetson-Renner Draylne Company at 30
cents per barrel, they ta. get a rebate of 5
cents per barrel. Then a,notÂ»ier member of the
association agreed to haul* the tement at 20
cents per barrel and secured- the Job, much to
the dissatisfaction of Mr. Renner. who be
cause the brotherhood i refuted t* Interfere in
the matter has been the cause of much dissen
sion between the association and the brother
hood. . . . . - Â¦ ' . ,Â¦ . â¢ - . : Â¦
upon yesterday. The controversy wiilprobably be settled, to-day and the men will ; return lo
work to-morrow or as soon thereafter as notices can reach them. 1 , ' } _ \- : ;
.While these conferences have been many. and neither side has expressed* a willingness
: to. admit defeat,, the. happy medium seems to have been found. Upon the strike of .the iron
workers much depended. Around that strike, national in, its importance 'and backed by the
..Grand Lodge of the International Association of Machinists, the. American Federation of
â¢ Labor; and other allied forces, pressure was concentrated; Against these were arrayed the %
owners of the various plants affectedj and the failure of the ironworkers' strike in the Eastern s
States seems to have brought about a realization ; of the conditions that would prevail, in San
EVERY indication points to an early < settlement of the troubles between, the ironworkers of ;Â¦
this city who went out on strike on May 20 and their, employers. The original demand
was for a nine-hour workday and an increase in wages then prevailing of 12, X A per \ cent.
Numerous conferences have been held, and a 6 per cent. advance was practically agreed ;

At the close of the Interview tnÂ« eom
xnittee took its departure and declined to
give an intimation as to whether it had
met with success or failure. The members
repaired immediately to headquarters,
â¢where the result of their meeting was
discussed at length.
Mr. Scott willingly told of the confer
ence. He said he did not invite It .nor
did he ask for one. He stated that- he
Â¦was always In bis office ready to see any
one who called on him. In speaking of
the meeting with his employes he said:
"I simply told them that I wanted It dis
tinctly understood before they had any
xhing to say that they did not come to my
office by my request or the request of any
one connected with the Union Iron Works.
"There were ten of our men In this com
mittee. They represented the different
<Jepartments In our yards. There was no
spokesman. Every man had his say and
I had mine.
"They were told there was no ill fueling
on the part of the Union Iron Works and
when they were ready to come back under
the same conditions of work and the same
pay that they were getting previous to
the strike they could come back. 1 told
them there would be another condition
imposed by us. and that was there was to
be less loafing than had been done pre
vious to May 20. I 6aid loafing would not
be tolerated, and I mean it. And, fur
ther, any man found derelict In his duty
would be discharged.
*'I showed the committee that the
profits in shipbuilding were not as great
as they believed. Mr. Burnet cUumed
that we made $1,800,000 profit on the bat
tleship Wisconsin. If we had I would
have retired from shipbuilding. I told
Mr. Burnet and other members of the
committee that we paid out $1,339.0(0 for
material, and if they so desired they could
secure experts to check up our boolts. I
don't suppose the men believed my state
ment, but nevertheless it Is true.
"The Union Iron Works rs moving â¢Jong

out that matters will remain as indicated

promise basis.
A special meetlnjr of the Iron-molders

At the present time there are about 100

Most of these patents, while quite simi

the same made by the steel casting com

roads. A movement will : be, made to
"standardize" by, adopting three or four
standard patterns and thus avoid the ne
cessity of forcing a railroad to carry
a stock of parts for so many styles or
couplers. The steel casting companies
own some of the principal patents and
will refuse to make couplers for thosrt

couplers is true also of brake shoes, driv

"No member of the brotherhood shall work
for any person on firm who Is not a member of
the Draymen'* Association, except that where
members of the brotherhood have been working
on teams which heretofore have- been operated
by a party who does his own work they may
continue doing that work, but no member of
the brotherhood shall work for any such party
for any lower rate of wages than herein set
forth. ' Â¦
? "No member ."Of the brotherhood shall drive
a team or do any work for any one -who has
been or may be expelled from the . Draymen's
Association, provided that if any member of
the Draymen's Association should be expelled
from the association the Brotherhood of Team

cause and to . continue to drive for. such ex

until satisfied that such expulsion is In good
faith and just.
"This agreement is to be in force for one
year from the date of signing, but any of thÂ«
parties hereto may call on the other to adjust
grievance? and may abrogate .this agreement
from cne day to one month after having given
notice to do so."
The Draymen's Association represented to
the committee of the teamsters that it con
trolled SO per cent of the draymen of San Fran
cisco, but when our rules went into effect we
found that it controlled about CO per cent only.
Thus we were confronted at the outset with
a difficulty in the effort to bring the draymen
not in the association under the rules of that
body. One firm In particular (the Globe Dray
age' Company) refused to join the association,
and the latter insisted that the members of the
brotherhood should not work <or that firm and
required us to take our members off the teams
of the latter, the association agreeing to pay
one- half of the cost of supporting the men thus
called offâ an agreement which was not carried
out by the association.
The Globe Drayase Company continued to do
business, much to the dissatisfaction of the
Draymen's Association. One member of the
former firm. Mr. Goggins, in the employ of the
\ Owl Drug Company, was compelled to sell out
bis interest in the firm, and the company itself
afterward sold out to the Draymen's Associa
tion.
The next trouble arose over the flat trucks
of the Haslett & Bailey Co.. which the asso-
I elation claimed was working a great injury
> to its business. The Draymen's Association
appointed a committee of three, namely, Messrs.
McNab, Evere and Cutter, which, falling to
effect a settlement, called uj>on the business
agent of the brotherhood to. If possible bring
about an agreement between, them. As a re
sult of our efforts a conference of all ware
housemen In San Francisco was held,, at which
an agreement on rates of drayage and storage
In excess of the former rates was reached. .
This arrangement seemed satisfactory for a
time, until Mr. Morton saw tit not to comply
with the terms of the warehousemen's combi
nation, and flatly refused to llvex up to its
rules, much to the dissatisfaction oil the Dray
nun's Association and the warehousemen. .

Again the Draymen's Association- appealed

Bales That "Were Adopted.
Prior to the organization of the Brotherhood
of Teamsters In San Francisco the dally hours
of labor of men in the teaming .Industry ran
from 5 a. m. to 8 p. m. and 9 p. m. Any man
who objected to these hours was immediately
told: "If you don't Uke : It you know what
you can do.". â¢ -- . ' -< Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ ; . ' ! 'â¢Â¦Â¦ '
Seeing that the abuses were so great, while
business in the teaming business was /good,
the teamsters banded themselves together for
their own Interests and protection. 'With this
object we formed a local . organization known
as the Brotherhood of Teams tera.
When about one week old the draylng- firm
of McXab & Smith undertook to disrupt our
organization. These gentlemen called their em
ployes together and stated Â¦ that â¢ they "must
either Quit the brotherhood or their employ."
They asked three of _ their employes It they
were members of the union, and being an
swered in th*- affirmative, these men were im
mediately discharged. The three members re
ported -the matter to the grievance committee'
on Sunday afternoon and on the following Mon
day the firm of McNab & Smith was requested
to reinstate them. On the arm's refusal to do
bo the remaining employes of the flrra were
called out, thus beginning the first strike-. oÂ£ the
brotherhood. . ! Â¦
After being out eight hours the firm decided
to take back the men, which it did, and the
incident was closed.. I

who were still employed should remain at
work until they were locked out.
The boxmakers are not on a strike, they
say.' They made no demands for rr>orÂ»

prevented the shipment of lumber or of

many of- the boxmakera were locked out
because of their union affiliations. In all
about 400 members of the union are out
of employment and five of the principal
factories of the eity are closed. Hobbs,
Wall & Co.'s factory is in operation andÂ»
is employing only twenty men. The other
factories that are affected are the Na

The Library Trustees have accepted the
building from Contractor Barrett and
maintain' that they have done their part.
The Council claims that the building is
unfinished, as none of the shelving has
been put in. It says that this . should
have been done with part of the $50,000
with which the Library Trustees prom
ised to complete the building.
The ; Trustees accuse the Council of
drawing parsimonious distinctions. They
point out the fact that the city has as
yet done nothing for the"* new library,
seeming content to look to. outside charity
to provide facilities for the free circula
tion of books. . The Trustees recently
made a strong appeal to the Council for
$10,000 with' which to provide furniture,
under which head they include shelving,
barely ..sufficient to enahle thorn to move

-as a Juvenile department and left, at their
request, for the Ebell ladles to finish.
The vestibule was overlooked in draw-
Ing up the contract. The architect claims
that It was included by implication, at
least, in the general agreement upon
â¢ which the contractor went to worfcc. At
any rate^. the finishing of this room was
not definitely specified in the contract and
the contractor refused to do the work
without extra compensation. The Trus
tees say that in this dilemma they were
forced to make terms, and agreed to give
Mr. Barrett $550 for putting in -the wood
work in the vestibule. "When it came to
doing the work they say that Barrett de
manded $700, and/ not having a written
contract for the'rormer agreement they
were forced to accede to the demand. In
cluding this $700,. for which they have pro
vided, the Trustees point proudly to the
fact tjiat the work will have cost as final
ly accepted for the city $50,250, only one
half of 1 per cent in excess of the original
stipulation. . -
The Ebell Society is making elaborate

HENSHAW SAYS
"BUY OR SELL"
Offers to Take All the
Transit Company's
; Lines.
But Corporation Will Take
Over Haywards System
From Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 27.
The final papers in the deal that Is now
pending for the sale of the Oakland, San
Leondro and Haywards Klectric Railway
will be signed on Monday, and the -Hay*
wards line will then become a part of the
system of the Oakland Transit Company.
It, transpired to-day that when William
G. Henshaw secured control of the
Haywards line he. submitted to the Oak
land -Transit Company a proposition to
purchase all of its lines or sell the com
pany the road of which he had so recently
secured the control. It was a big deal,
for the transit company values its roads
at several millions of dollars.' The Oak
land Transit Company was more willing
to buy. the Haywards line than it was to
sell its own property, and so it. was de
cided, as was announced in The Call sev
eral days ago, that the Oakland Transit
Company would purchase the Haywards
lino. 1
Mr. Henshaw was ready - to make his
deal, an'd it is said that he had behind
him the necessary financial backing to
hove taken over the lines of the Oakland
TiansltyCompany. The offer Is still open,
but has been refused by the. transit com
pany. On Monday. the deal will have to
be closed one way or the other, and It
will be closed by the Oakland Transit
Company purchasing the Hay wards line
from Mr. Henshaw.
The Realty Syndicate, which owns the
stock of the Oakland Transit Company,
to-day took possession of the old Blair
ranch at Piedmont. The syndicate as
sumed the. mortgage and paid' the Blair
heirs their equity. The, Piedmont line of
the Oakland Transit Company will be run
through this property from old Piedmont
Junction when this line is rebuilt. The
surveys for the new line have already
been made.

OAKLAND, July 27.â The suit begun by

Mrs. Walker claims that she took care
of the late mining man for thirty-seven

Pelletreau answered the suit by denying
that Mrs. Walker had cared for him for
more than twelve weeks or that her ser

and stating that ho had paid her in full
for the same.
There is only $192 C5 in' Pelletreau's es

HEROES PERISH
IN THE FLAME
From the collection of " articles at the
City Hall several identifications were
made to-day. Two large jardinieres were
found that belonged to the family of Wil
liam D. English.- former Collector of the
Port of San Francisco. They had been
taken from his residence, 12S Tenth street,
several months ago.
Edward Everett, former School Direc
tor, found two jardinieres that .had been
in the possession of his family for twen
ty-five years. - .
A discovery wag made of several rugs
hidden in the cellar of the Teeple house.
These rugs, illustrate the peculiar char
acter of these thefts. The rugs were never
used, and were simply hidden in the cel
lar, apparently with the idea of keeping
them out of sight. Yet, one of- the -ruga
was Identified to-day by Mrs. Frank E.
Brlgham of 1007 O&k street as having been
taken from her home more than a year
ago. The rug was apparently hidden as
soon as it reached the Teeple house.
Mrs. Brlgham also found a Japanese
bamboo holder for a flower pot and two
large jardinieres. These latter contained
earth and mud and "plants when they
were taken from the Brigham home, and
must have weighed between seventy-five
and 100 pounds each. This fact adds mys
tery to the strange affair, for It is argued
that the women could not have carried
these articles away without masculine
help, because of the weight. Yet not the
slightest suspicion attaches to the hus
bands. *Â»â¢."*â¢/
ilar features, and It la by far the most
remarkable that has, ever confronted the
police of Oakland. The women who are
charged with these unusual thefts are not
In a position of life where such acts.would
be looked for. The thefts were not made
for profit, because no attempt was ever
made to dispose of any of the â¢ articles
taken. They were not made because the
articles could hot be secured at home, be
cause the husbands of the two wom-an
were able and willing: to have gratified
the wishes of their wives had these wishes
been expressed. In fact, Mr. Teeple
thought that the'artlcles that appeared
in his home from time to time had been
purchased by his wife, and he never ques
tioned her purchases. The thefts seem to
have been prompted by a kleptomaniac
desire. ' . "-Â¦Â¦Â¦ '.:Â¦-.

DENVER, July 27.â Dr. Charles Gress-
well, formerly. State Veterinarian of Col
orado and at present chairman", of - the
National j Livestock Association, does . not
readily accept as correct the statement
ol Dr. Koch that bovine and human tuber
culosis are not intercommunlcable. â¢
In a letter addressed to President John
W. Springer- of the National Livestock
Association to-day,; and made public by
the latter, Dr. Gresswell calls attention to
the fact â¢ that cattlemen, if Dr. Koch's
statement is accepted as correct, will de
mand the suspens'on of. the tuberculin test
now in use to preven: the sale of cattle
afflicted with tuberculosis. Â¦ 'He asserts
that .this would cause a rapid â¢ reversion
of ~ the old-time prevalence of the tuber
culin diseases, which, he says, there is no
question these : repressive measures have
diminished. He that the- evi
dence for and against should be very
carefully weighed and final judgment sus
pended until a corroboration of Dr. Koch's
results have , been obtained by other ob
servers. ' . ' : "..-Â¦'.

The increase In farm wealth for the ds
cade amounted to 162 per cent. Of the
total number, there are seventy-one farms
of core than 1000 acres and 814 of less
than 300 acres. About half of the latter
class belong to Indians. Of the total in
vestment in farms over half, or $15,458,717,
was in livestock. The number iof cattle
is placed at 607,454 and of sheep at 668,450.
The report shows that of the total area
of the Territory a little more than one
third of 1 per cent is Improved. During
the last decade 543 miles of irrigation
ditches were constructed at a cost of $1,
508,469. The prediction is made that ulti
mately a much largos area will be brought
under cultivation by ditches than now.
The principal crop is alfalfa, of which 62,
5So acres were grown in 1899.
Â¦WASHINGTON, July 27.â According to
a bulletin issued by the Census Bureau

which 254,521 are Improved. Of these
farms, 1769 are owned by 1 Indians. In 1890
there were only 104,128 acres of* improved
lands in the Territory. In 1890 the aver
age size of farms was 910 acres, and in
1900 468 acres. The total value of the
farm land, with Improvements, imple

LOtriSVTLLE. Ky., July 27.â A flst fight
that threatened to lead to a tragedy tilled
Jefferson street, near Fourth, the business
part of the city, with an excited crowd
this afternoon. . ~ v
P. Booker .Reed, president of the Board
of Aldermen, who was last week defeated
in a Republican primary for the nomina
tion of Mayor of Louisville and who has
since made many charges concerning the
Â¦way the primary was conducted, and John
Boro. who was prominent in the Republi
can faction that defeated Reed, were the
principals In the fight, though others
joined in on both sides until the contest
was stopped.
The affray occurred in front of Repub
lican headquarters. After the men had
separated Reed went East on Jefferson
etreetf, followed by a large crowd. Present
ly he returned with a pistol in his band,
and as he was apparently making straight
for the Republican headquarters, into
which Boro had gone, the crowd in the
street looked for trouble at once. Reed,
however, turned into a saloon a few doors
from the Republican headquarters, and
after a while Boro left the headquarters
end the situation was relieved. Reed re
mained in the saloon ana the men did not
meet again.

â¢ Many a man'yrho' knows his own 'mind
has. a somewhat limited acquaintance.
The celebration at Bayreuth of the quar
ter-centennial anniversary of the erection
of the Wagnerian Theater awakens much
interest. The production last evening of
the "Walkyrie" aroused phenomenal en
thusiasm, especially for Herr Krauss in
his interpretation of the part of Slgmund.
Such applause had never before been
heard in Bayreuth. Herr Niemann rushed
on the stage and kissed Krauss. The or
chestra was conducted by Herr. Richter,
and Mme. Patti was present at the per
formance.
I am emphatically against Dr. Koch's deduc
tions. He ignores everything we owe to the
investigations and experiments; of v the Copen
hagen school. The commission' of the ' Danish
Government conducted the must thorough ex
periments, the results of which are most flatly
contradicted by Dr. Koch. â¢ You cannot say
"Rome has spoken" because" Dr. iCoch is not
Rome and Â¦ the matter â¢ is far from being set
tled.,.; . . . . ; . -. ....Â¦âÂ¦, .'-;":V ..?,';Â¦?
The German newspapers .'have printed
lengthy reports of the address of Dr. Rob
ert Koch before the British -congress on
tuberculosis, held in London this week,
but few opinions on Dr. 'Koch's address
have .been expressed. -Professor Virchow,
the well-known scientist, after having dis
sented at a meeting of the medical society
from Dr. Koch's expressions in London,
has expressed still stronger dissent from
these views in an interview, in which he
said: â¢ .. Â¦ ." â¢â¢ â¢ .
The grain duties are insufficient. The duty
on tobacco must be increased â¢ and potatoes
must .be protected. - Every exertion must â¢ be
made to transform this wholly inadequate
tariff into an effective protection for domestic
interests and the Government* must ; yield to
the full agricultural demands when the farmers
declare "Kliwand Klarr" â¢ in the Reichstag
what duties the agriculturists need to exist.
The Liberal papers say the bill can only
make Socialist votes, and in this connec
tion 'these papers point out the most re
cent evidence of the growth of Socialism
in the results of two bye-elections held in
the Memel district,^ in which the Conser
vatives lost about 2000 votes as against
their majority of 1S98, while the Socialists
gained about. the same number. In the
Duesberg-Ruhrort district in the elections
held July 25 the Socialists polled 14,000
votes, this being a gain of 100 per cent in.
the last three years. The Deutsch Tages
Zeitung opens war upon the tariff bill and
declares: . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
Bven moderate papers like the National
Zeitung confess that their worst fears
about concessions to the agrarians - are
not only confirmed, but exceeded. The
National Zeitung points out that the
agrarians gain great advantages besides
those resulting from high duties through
the abolition of the present bonded ware
house privileges on grain and the abolition
of the bill requiring cash payment of du
ties or 4 per. cent interest thereon: Some
of the German papers interpret the North
German Gazette's (inspired statement to
the effect that the . bill , is only tentative
and that .the Reichstag and Bundesrath
may change it as meaning that the Gov
ernment wishes mod era ion in agricultural
duties. All signs indicate that a heated
agitation against the bill will break out
throughout ths country. /.
With regard to paragraph eight of the
bill, the best argument for convincing for
eign countries of the value of commercial
treaties with Germany, the Liberal papers
emphasize the fact that this tariff bill
comes at a time when German Industries
are already in the throes of a severe cri
sis, and that it can only cause new con
vulsion in the industrial life. These pa
pers express the fear that the United
States will adopt reprisals upon German
shipping, and they also point "out that
Germany's allies, Austria and Italy, must
lose a large part of their German trade.
It gives us the means to protect "ourselves
against the high-handed manner In which the
United- States interprets: reciprocity. We are
decidedly discriminated against ' under present
conditions. We were weaponless against such
leonine treatment - in . tariff matters because
Caprtvl (the late former German Imperial
Chancellor) literally threw away -the 'most , : fa
vored nation treatment. . This new- tariff
shows a .determination , to insure ourselves a
place In the sun in tariff matters and we ex
pect German â¢ manufacturers to agree thereto,
since many have suffered from the supercili
ousness of Americana in tariff treatment. ,.'
The Post praises the wise moderation of
the bill, which, ; it says, renders it ac
ceptable abroad and at home. The -Post
interprets the eighth -paragraph as direct
ed against the United States, and says;
July 27.'â All the "morning pa
pers devote much space to the tariff bill.
The majority of . the : Conservative papers
give the provisions of the bill, with little
discussion thereof, the, tone â¢ of , which,
however, is that the duties have been only
moderately -increased, and not so much
so "as the agriculturists desired, but ! that
Count von Bulow, the Imperial Chancel
lor, did his - best. The Deutsch Tages
Zeituns considers the increase in' duties
set forth in the bill to . be moderate and
that foreign countries will breathe, more
freely since its publication.

1 of one month remains before the opening
of the twenty-eighth Triennial Conclave of
the Knights Templar of the United States,
to be held in this city August 27 to 30, in
clusive. Over 1000 cities and towns. in the
Union have one or more subordinate "com
manderies, with' a total membership of
125,000 Knights, and all will be represented
either through individual delegations or
through the grand bodies of the respec
tive States. ' i \f
According to contracts made for quar
ters to date, Templar visitors will be
present from the following States: Ala
bama, Arkansas, . California'," Colorado,
Connecticut, District of Columbia, Flor
ida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, In
dian Territory, Kansas, Kentucky. Louis
iana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Michigan, Minnesota, Mis
sissippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
South ' Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Ver
mont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin,
Idaho, South Carolina.
Louisville has made ample preparations
for the reception - of the- great white
plumed army and the tens of thousands
of other visitors that will . be brought
with it. A citizens' committee has raised
a fund of $100,000 for the entertainment of
the city's guests. Particular attention is
to be paid to the subject of the decoration
and illumination of the city, the sum of
$50,000 being expended in this- manner
alone. A quadruple electric arch is to be
the most noteworthy feature. This,struct
ure is now in course of erection at the in
tersection of Fourth avenue and Broad
way. . Â¦. . .
The week of the conclave will be one of
rare attractions. The State's reputation
for hospitality is to be maintained at the
Louisville Custom-house, where the
Grand Commandery of Kentucky will
have headquarters. Attractions are con
tinually being added to the, week'3 pro
gramme so that it is impossible to an
nounce the complete schedule at this date.
Divine services will be conducted on Sun
day afternoon, August 25, at Broadway M.
E." Church South by the Rev. J. C. W.
Coxe, D.D., of Washington, Iowa, grand
prelate of the Grand Encampment. An es
cort committee of 700 Kentucky Knights
will be on duty from Saturday until Tues
day morning. All incoming delegations
will be met at the railway stations and
escorted by uniformed Templars with
bands of music to their stopping place.
On Monday evening the Kentucky Grand
Commandery headquarters will be opened.
Tuesday morning the conclave proper will
be inaugurated with thegrand parade. In
dications point to' the appearance of 30,000
uniformed Knishts Templar and 125 bands
of music in the procession. The route of
the parade covers the handsomest and
broadest thoroughfares in the city. On
Tuesday evening a monster lawn fete will
be given at the Masonic Widows' and
Orphans' Home, a fireworks exhibition ac
companying this feature. . The same even
ing a chorus r.f 200 negro voices, under
the direction of Colonel Will S. Hays,
will give an entertainment at the Horse
Show building.
The second day of the conclave will be
devoted to the competitive drills. Five
magnificent sterling silver trophies, val
ued at $5000, are to be awarded as prizes.
Not since the triennial of 1S83, at San
Francisco, have the Knights Templar held
a similar contest. There will be - two
divisions in the drillsâ one -for "..infantry
corps and one for mounted troops. " Nine
of the crack drill teams of the country
are entered, as follows: Infantry Divi
sionâColumbia No. 2, Washington, D. C. ;
Allegheny, Pa., No.;35. Cavalryâ No. 3,
Parkersburg, W. Va,; Hanselmann, No.
1G, Cincinnati: St. Bernard, No. 35. Chi
cago; Colorado No. 1, Denver;- Golden
Gate No. 16, San Francisco. Mounted
Divisionâ Mount Vernon No. 1, Columbus,
Ohio, and California No. 1, San Fran
cisco. In ' connection with ' the drills
twenty-seven Kentucky belles will appear
as sponsors for the Sir Knights entered
in the contests.
The conclave ball will take place Thurs
day evening at Confederate Hall, a great
building that will accommodate 15.000
dancers at one time. This function bids
fair to surpass in brilliancy any social
event ever given in the South.

Why is It. our competitors fight and say
more against the LudwlK piano than any
other make? Because they know that there,
is more real value in the "Ludwlg" than
any other piano. It Is the best piano for the'
money in the market. They know it We i
know it and you will know It when you see
and hear it.

MONTEZUMAâ COPPER-COALâ COKE.
MONTEZUMAâ COPPERâ COALâ COKE.
. MONTEZUMAâ COPPERâ COALâ COKE.
Agreeably to promise we are enabled,
through the courtesy of California sharehold-
ers, who have Just returned from a visit to
the properties of Montezuma Mining Co., near
Fairfax. Washington, to present to the large
body of shareholders, who could not accom-
pany the excursion, and to prospective Invest-
ors as well, many strong letters o* ccm-
mendation of both properties and management
These letters are written by honorable men
who are competent to do their own thinking
and In their reports tell "the whole truth and
nothing but the truth" of the Montezuma's
great copper and coal properties. We repro-
duce below brief Quotations from these letters
Â¦R-hlch are printed in full In circular form and
will be mailed free on application.
QUOTATIONS.
"If there ever was a copper 'show* to make
stockholders enthusiastic that Is the 'Monte-
zuma's.' "
"My. specimens, taken at random from the
tunnels,' contain better values than the ore
on exhibition at the company's office."
"The veins of coal already uncovered, vary-
ing from 6 to 11 feet In width, convinced me
that my Investment was a good one."
"The great difficulties that stood In the way
of opening up this property will, when over-
come, enable the plant to be worked almost
automatically." (This refers to water power
and dralnaze tunnels.)
"Too much praise cannot be given *.o the
management of Colonel C. W. Thompson, the
president of the company. His very presence
assures one of the successful completion of
the work he has taken in hand."
"I found the properties to be much more
developed than I had expected and in my
judgment more valuable than represented. All
the work connected with them seems to have
been done in a systematic and economical
manner, consistent with a well-matured gen-
eral plan of operating a large property."
"Nature has certainly exerted herself In
favor of the Montezuma Mining Company.
Tour circulars, as eent out from time to time,
do not set forth the wonderful possibilities of
the district. I am satisfied the officers of the
company are men of integrity and ability and
thoroughly conversant with their business."
"I undertook the trip with some doubt of
the final outcome, expecting the usual exhibi-
tion of a 'hole in the ground,' 'and a voluble
description of what we are going to do, but
imagine by surprise when a full realization of
the possibilities and magnitude of the under-
taking dawned upon me. I believe rpy in-
vestment beyond the point of speculation and
in the realm of the 'sure thing.' "
"Every indication points to the fact that the
Montezuma has in this 'Tacoma' mine a fund
of almost inexhaustible wealth."
As the natural result of this visit of share-
holders and the subsequent increased sale of
shares, prices are advancing and Installment
terms are etlffenlng. All installment terms
prior to this date are withdrawn and "the
schedule given below will hold for only a
Ehort time.
PRICES:
The present price cl Montezuma shares is
15c cash or 17c on Installments. After August
1 the price will be 18c cash or 21c on Install-
ments, the company reserving the right to
withdraw these prices without notice.
INSTALLMENT TERMS.
1000 shares. $10 down and -$10 monthly.
8000 shares, $30 down and $30 monthly.
4000 shares, $40 down and $40 monthly. Â¦
6000 shares, $50 down and $42 50 monthly.
> C000 shares, $60 down and $51 monthly.
! 10,000 chares, $100 down and $85 monthly.
The quality of Montezuma shares Is evi-
1 denced by the fact' that the slump in oil stocks
and the prevailing labor troubles do not
seriously interfere with our business. Monte-
zuma has the confidence of every shareholder
and is making new converts every day.
It is the biggest and safest mining company
on the continent that offers its shares by popu-
lar subscription.
N. B.â We make a standing offer of $100 and
expenses to the person who, after visiting the
Montezuma mines, flnd3 we have made a sin-
gle misstatement thereof.

up grade or the down grade. The dealings in
vhe Steel stocks and to a certain extent in the
vJrariKors and Pacincs overshadowed the r%st of
the market. The Steel etocks were stronir on
the same kind of operations as those of yester
day, seemingly based on a belief in an early
triumph of the corporation in the strike con
test. The common stock rose an .extreme i%
and the preferred 2U. The corn-carrylngr rail

Induced no following, and covered- their short

The week Just passed has- given pretty clear
evidence of the culmination, for the time at
least, of the rpeculatlon for the decline in
tiooks and for the rise In grains, which has
been going on In the various markets during
the whole of July. The effect on the stock mar
ket has been feverish and Irregular movements
of prices with narrowing fluctuations and de
creasing volumes of business. According to the
Invariable rule in speculative movements of any
dimensions, this one >has overdone Itself. The
consequence hnÂ« been reaction from the recent
ly prevailing tendency. Stocks have recovered
and grains have relapsed. Monday morning's
prices were the low. .Â«t of the week, but did not
reach, except In a tew cases, the level of the
preceding Monday. Expert estimates of the corn
yield on the basis of the damage done reveal
that a large traffic yet remains for the rail
roads from the crop and the Important compen
sation of a â¢uereuful wheat crop Is urged. The
relatively smaller proportion borne by the grain
traffic on the Western railroads to the total
tonnage Is taken Into con8ld>r*atlon. But when
all is raid, the fact is still recognised that the
unprecedentedly prosperous conditions of the
last few years ' are already altered with tha
final outcome of the steel rtrike still to be
reckoned with. Even with the severe losses al
ready recorded from the high level of the year
in the prices of railroad stocks the fact is kept
In mind that the l>Urh level was beyond all
warrant In actual conditions and represented a
Urge degree of speculative Inflation. Question-
Ing arose, which found no place In the excited
period of bull (peculation, as to just how stocks
are to benefit in value, even supposing all that
has been related of community of interests and
passing of control of centralized railroad sys
tems be true. The process In almost every in
stance was approximately the came and In
volved the purchase of control at high prices
and the issuance of bonds ahead of the stock
of the purchasing railroad. These bond Issues
are of a volume that require high earnings of
the most prosperous years by the purchased
roads to pay the charges upon them and to keep
the system out of bankruptcy. Another consid
eration Is the enormous amount of capital and
credits tied up in the purchasing syndicates of
various control.
The beginning this week in a small way of
the transfer of currency to the interior to move
the crops calls attention to the fact that re
cent liquidation in the stock market had as its
object preparation to meet this requirement,
and not to supply means ,for a renewed specu
lation In stocks. The question also arises
whether this year will see the normal response
to this Interior movement of currency In an in
flow of gold frqm abroad. It will be remem
bered that* since the South African war cut off
the supply of gold from Europe the United
States has seen no important Inflow of gold,
when our export of foodstuffs begins to go
abroad. This was true in spite of a merchan
dise export balance in our favor unprecedented
In our history. Foreign money markets look
for a demand for gold from New Tork in the
autumn, but as to their ability to meet it au
thorities are not agreed. The speculative out
look from the present level of prices is thus

CHICAGO, July 87.â September wheat opened
T4Â®lHo lower at 69K@69%c; under the influence
of weakness at Liverpool and fair showers In
the . Northwest, almost the. only part of the
country where a bumper crop Is not yet as
cured. The bulk of .tho day's business <was
done, during the first half hour, during which
many small lines were, liquidated. This pres
sure eased later and the ro was a moderate cov
ering movement and some . reinstating of long
lines because of â¢ fear that damage might 'be
done this spring wheat crop by hot weather,
thought to bo due, following recent rains. The
market was thus woifced up to 70c. but thÂ«
close found the feeling rather weak, September
selling Tio undor yesterday at 69%c.
Corn values sagged '. lower on showers and
moderating temperatuics. Long corn came out
at the opening. At the low point of the day,
however there were crders to buy. The clote
wus easy, September H<5^4c lower at 55%Â©35isc.
Oats were moderately active but lower.' in
sympathy with wheat and corn. September
closed â¢H(!T ! Sic lower at. 34HÂ®34Hc .
The liberality of the nog movement continued
to have a depressing* effect on provision fu

NEW YORK. July 27.â The statement of the
associated banks for the week ending to-day
shows: Loans. JS67.652.400; Increase, $11,454,900.
Deposits, ?942.!>3S.500; Increase, 13,793,200. Cir
culation. $30,C37.300: decrease. $72,600. Legal
tenders. J79.942.000; increase. $1,628,100. Specie,
$178,921,200; increase, Sl.419,400. Reserves, $258,
6S3.200: increase, ?3,047,500. Reserve required,
$535,734,625; Increase. $948,100. Surplus, $23,127,
600: Increase, $2,099,200.
The Financier says: The . statement â¢ of the
associated banks last week was again- favor
able, ehowlng an Increase of $2,009,200: In sur
plus, carrying this item to $23,128,575. or the
highest amount since February, when the sur
plus was t24.630.S25. The banks may there
fore be regarded as In an exceedingly strong
position for this season of the year, and they
are presumably able to meet prospective de
mands for money from their correspondents In
the agricultural sections of the country for
crop moving purposes without being under the
necessity of restricting accommodations .. to
local borrowers. The gain of $17,917,050" in sur
plus since the first week in July has been
chiefly accomplished through Â¦ the ..heroic con
traction in loans, there having been a deduc
tion of $33,268,400 in the two weeks ending
July 13 and July 20. It is noteworthy that the
expansion of loans shown by last week's state
ment was largely Incidental to the increase in
the capital and surplus of the First National.
The payment made for the increase of $9,500,
000 capital stock of the bank was placed - in
the loan account and presumably the additional
$5,000,000 surplus was transferred to cash from
the undivided profit account of the institution.
Comparisons of gains in the items of loans,
specie, legal tenders and deposits of the First
National show an increase during the week of
$9,002,400 In loans, a gain of $6,047,000 in specie
and an increase of $100,200 In legal tenders. These
items together call for a gain of $15,177,000 in
deposits, whereas the increase shown Â¦ by this
statement of the bank was only 15,688,400, and
hence the statement of this bank does not har
monize by nearly $10,000,000. The gain of $3,
047,500 In â¢ cash showed by Saturday's return
of the associated banks . very nearly corre
sponds with the preliminary estimates, but
as above stated the exceptional gain In this
item by one bank deranges all calculations and
makes necessary a reference to the table of In
dividual gains or losses in the item referred to.
The deposits of the banks as a whole show an
Increase of but $3, 793, 200. whereas the gains In
loans and In each together call for an increase
of $14,6O2*,40O in deposits. The difference of
$10,708,000 is in great part accounted for through
reasons already given. Â¦ Â¦ , _

v LONDON, July 27.-nRumors of Impor
tant changes in the South African com
mand are increasing. Weeks ago the Out
look printed a curious paragraph- which
escaped observation. ; It said:
"Has. the. term of Lord Kitchener's occu
pation of the post of commander in chief
in Southern' Africa nearly run its course?"
And it . stated that in* London circles,
where- such - a â¢- fact -would : naturally be
Known, it v/as expected that he would ie
tu'rn to this country early "in September,
and that his successor -would probably be
Lieutenant General Neville G. Lyttleton.
That officer _Is -now in London, and is not
only in close communication with the "War
Office, .but -is .reported to be quietly select
ing, his staff and- making preparations for
his return to the front. His share in the
war in- South Atrica has thus. far been one
cf its most commendable features.
Confirming this, the Standard's corre
spondent at Cape Town forwarded by mail
a report' current there at the beginning of
the month to' the effect that Lord -Kitch
ener will relinquish the chief command in
South' Africa -at 'the end of August and
proceed to England, where he will remain
five .months before taking over- the su
preme. command in India. Sir -Blndo'n
Blood, according to this correspondent, is
expected to succeed him as commander in
chief in South Africa.

of July 26; Lord Kitchener . reporte ,to the

:. "A" detachment ; of Stelnacker's Horse,

mestic products $1,460,453,809.: The imports
by great classes in the fiscal year 1901.

curs chiefly in raw silk, hides and skins,

.the reduced value is partially due to re
duction of price rather than quantity.

value of 34.1 per cent, while the number

CHICAGO, July 27.â The Chronicle says:
Warships, not only for the "United States,
but for foreign countries, may be built on
the great lakes in the near future. To ac
complish this the shipbuilders located on
the lakes, supported by manufacturers
and concerns that cater to the shipbuild
ing business, are combining in a move
ment to demand the abrogation of the
treaty with Great Britain which excludes
warships from the lakes.
Congressman Boutelle. who will look
after the campaign at the coming session
of Congress, said: " â¢ . â¢; /
"The existence of 'Â¦ the treaty i* mani
festly unfair to the people of the lake cit
ies. In 1898 Congress appropriated $126,000
to begin the construction of a vessel on
which the naval militia of the lakes might
be trained, but it was found that the
treaty stood in the way. The shipyards
situated on the shores of the great lakes,
which employ thousands of men, are not
allowed to bid on the work for foreign
navies because of this treaty. It is time
something was done to remedy the situa
tion. \ ' -'

Cup, a "welg:ht-f or-age race at two miles
and a quarter, -was run at Bilghton Beach
to-day. It was not the. feature of the
day's eport. as had been expected, how
ever, as Prince of Melbourne 'and Roch
ester were the only ' two' to face ' the
e tarter, and It amounted to a practical
walkover for Prince of Melbourne.
All the eliglbles for the cop were bro
ken down or temporarily retired, so . the
race was a disappointment. Previous to
to-day's racing both horses were sold at
auction, G. Walbaum paying $20,500. for
Prince of Melbourne and R.' R. Rice,
owner of Wax Taper, $2600 for Rochester.
Prince of Melbourne was naturally at a
prohibitive price In the betting, being
quoted at 1 to 20, while Rochester was 12
to L
Shaw took Prince of Melbourne to the
front at the start and led by six lengths,
grolng by the stand the first time, but
rounding the first turn his mount bolted,
and before Shaw could stop him McCue
had Rochester eight lengths in front
Those who had taken a "piker's" chance
on Rochester cheered as he showed the
way for the first mile. Shaw made up his
ground gradually, however, and, taking
command in the beginning of the last
mile, romped home, an easy winner, in
the slow time of 4:03 3-5. The stake was
.worth. 357SS to the winner.
