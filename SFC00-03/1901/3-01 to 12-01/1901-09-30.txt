Hundred feet away in front of the
McKlnley vault and Is said to have
reached the ton within a few sec
onds after he heard the shot, but when he
arrived tl^e guard was at the foot "of the
slope in which the vault is puilt, where
he rolled after the assault, and the sup
posed prowlers were making their j escape
with a'good lead. Others of the company
were attracted by the report of the rifle,
but reached -the scene too late to be of
any assistance except to participate in the
pursuit and the search made of the cem
etery and in increasing the guard for the
night.
" Stories regarding the incident when
they reached the city were connected with
the jail delivery that occurred about the
same time. â¢ â¢
While there seems to be no doubt that
at least two prowlers attempted to reach
the j vault, there is much difference of
opinion as to the object of the intruders,
who evidently made good their escape,
as the cemetery has been searched over
in vain.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 2Q.â To-night Guard Deprend, stationed in the
rear of the vault in which the body of the late President McKinley
lies,was attacked by a man and cut slightly. The guard had challenged
a man seen prowling about the cemetery near the vault. A second
man made the assault on the guard. Military, men, obeying the
rules, will not be quoted on the matter, but the story in brief is stated
authoritatively as follows: Â¦ :
Guard Deprend saw a man behind a tree about 7:45 o'clock to-night.
He requested the man to halt, but the fellow dodged from his first position
to a second tree about ten feet nearer the guard. Sentinel Deprend then
raised his gun and fired.
Just as he did this a second man, Â¦ masked, who had stealthily ap
proached, knocked the jrun from its aim. At the same time the soldier was
struck a heavy blow on the back, and was assaulted with some sharp instru
ment. He was knocked into a small ravine at the vault.
Guard Deprend says the man behind the tree carried a package of white
and some instrument in his hand which showed a glint. , .
The men escaped despite the prompt rush of the officer of the day, and
other soldiers to his assistance. â¢.- N
Military men say they believe it was an attempt to blow up the vault.
To-night there are reports that men were overheard to say recently about
the vault, that there are many men who would like to see the place blown to
pieces. . ' â¢ â¢
An extra guard has been posted near the vault, and all of the seventy-two
men of the local militia company are ordered to be ready \o respond at any
moment.
There are seventy soldiers at the cemetery, twenty of whom are con
stantly on guard duty about the vault and camp.

Samar is a country about as large as the
State of Ohio and the American forces of
occupation numbered In all between 2000
and 2500 men. These are distributed among
various posts in the island, a large num
ber being located at the. more Important
centers. Spain never made any efforts to
occupy Samar, and it only has been for
probably three months past that the Unit
ed States has undertaken that work. The
latest report made by General Hughes to
the "War Department waÂ« that the num
ber of insurgent rifles In the island ag
gregated about 300. The Filipinos carried
on a guerrilla warfare and operations
against them were difficult. The disaster
to Company C of the Ninth Infantry oc
curred, it is believed, while it was engaged
In an expedition to clear the country of
roving bands of these insurgents. The
fact that the Americans were attacked
while at breakfast Indicates the daring
and pluck of the insurgents. Immediately
on receipt of the dispatch Adjutant Gen
eral Corbin cabled General Chaffee to send
t. complete report of the fight" and a list
of the casualties.
The news created a sensation in official
circles. It was the first severe . reverse
that has occurred for a long time*. ~15tllÂ»
the officials were not unprepared for news
of just this character from Samar, In
which the revolution started by Agulnaldo
still continues.
News Creates Sensation.
Mindanao and in Samar, where our peo
ple have not come In very close contact
with the natives, there Is still eome little
trouble. I saw General Hughes, .who
commands In Samar, and he assured me
that, though the situation was much im
proved and that it is only a question of
time before that country will also be
quieted, one must take into consideration
that it is a difficult undertaking to reach
the interior of all these Islands and con T
vince the natives of our sincere 1 intentions.
Samar itself Is as large as the State of
Ohio, and it is really the last of the Isl
ands in which we have undertaken the
work of reform and education." â¢
"The" conditions In, Luzon now are as
peaceable as the State of Maryland. I
went everywhere without any molesta
tion. There was never the slightest dan
ger. Of course in some of the islands the
conditions are not so peaceable. Down in
When General Corbin returned from his
tour of the islands last week he bad this
to cay about the conditions there:
' Adjutant General Corbin said , to-night
"that Eamar was one of the,', most fertile
of the Philippine Islands and had an area
equal, to the State of Ohio. It was never
subdued by the Spaniards, and Is in a
very wild and uncultivated state. Natives
near the sea are all friendly, and General
Hughes said when General Corbin visited
the island that there were only about 350
insurgents in Samar. Those, he said,
were scattered, and if he could only, get
them together In a bbdy he felt certain
he could pacify the Island In an hour. It
is General Corbln's belief that all those
insurgents collected and attacked the iso
lated company of Captain Connell and
then took to the mountains. He thinks
the officers escaped, because they were
breakfasting apart from the men. Pur
suit will be a very difficult thing, because
there are very few passes- through the
dense woods and only recently $20,000 was
sent to General Hughea to' bo expended
in road building. General Corbin has tel
egraphed General Chaffee for a complete
list of the dead and wounded. The hght;
ing must have been very severe and the
number of insurgents overwhelming,
when forty-eight men out of seventy-two
were killed and eleven wounded, leaving
only thirteen "of the entire command to
escape unscathed. Â¦â¢Â¦ " â¢
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29.-News of re

Kinley have not been received In the Phil

killed by an anarchist, and this intelli

WASHINGTON, Sept. 29.â Mr. Squlers.
the United States Secretary of Legation
at Peking, has forwarded to the State
Department, v under date of August 1. a
report from Consul Martin at Chinklang
inj.which Mr. Martin sets. out three con
ditions which he believes to be absolutely
essential to success in commercial rela
tions with Chiria:
1. If foreigners ever build up a large trade
In China it must be with the help of the Chi
nese themselves, and this can be . done only
by treating them with respect. No American
can live In China long without seeing that
foreigners are Inclined to treat the Chinese
negligently, even when their interests would
seem to indicate an opposite course. The Chi
nese resent this.
2. The entire country should be open to for
eign trade and a Judicial system should be
formulated to meet the requirements of all
foreigners in the empire. Much of the trouble
In the past has arisen from differences of
opinion as to what punishment would best
subserve the ends of Justice.
3. The likin should be abolished in favor of
some other system of taxation that would se
cure the required revenue. The llkln as now
operated I regard as the most perfect method
of extracting all conceivable profit from trade.
Its tendency is to localize trade by hedging:
goods about with such expenses that they can
not be moved. When commodities can be trans
ported from one end ot China to the- other
without any taftc' save the freight the whole
nation will teem with activity.

yrr T. PETERSBURG. Sept. 29.â Fol-
lowing up the recent publication
â 5^i of the famine conditions in thir-
teen districts, the Minister of the
Interior, M. Sipiaguine, to-day Is
sued a long statement on failure and
the measures* of famine relief upon which
the Central Government has decided.
Acting upon telegraphic reports from the
various Governments, the Government has
begun the work vigorously. The sum of
96,000 roubles has been appropriated for
the Government of Saratoff, 407,000 roubles
for Tauris, 100,000 roubles for non-military
points in the Don Basin and 190.000 roubles
with a supply of autumn seed from the
Government at Yekaterlnoslaff. â¢> "
On August 15 the Central Government s
famine fund amounted to only 530,000 rou
bles. Emperor Nicholas ordered that this
bo increased to 14,000,000 roubles.
Wfcero Aid Is Needed.
According to the reports of the Govern
ment state assistance is required in nine
teen provinces, not counting the country
of the Don Cossacks, which is under the
War Department. The reports estimate
requirements for autumn and winter only,
not mentioning the spring, when the need

The favorable American railroad re
ceipts helped to gradual recoveries not
only In the American section, but all
around, and while the closing prices were
generally below those that marked the
opening of the week, a better feeling 1 pre
vailed. "With business quiet, all sorts of
rumors are rife regarding the intentions \
of the* Amalgamated Company, the one I
most in favor of the reduction of the dlvl- '
dends. which was due to a .plan of the
managers to compel, the other companies,
notably Rio Tlntos and Calumet, to Join
hands with the Amalgamated Company
in curtailing the copper supply of the
world.
One of the ablest experts draw* atten
tion to the "utter lack of sense of pro
portion which Europe, especially Paris,
has exhibited by nearly going panic
stricken over such an apparently inci
dental affair as the copper matter." He '
points out that this serious state which
existed during the- week was due to a be- I
lief very generally held in Germany and
France that the inability of the Anaconda
people to meet expectations was only the
premonitory symptom of the collapse of
all amalgamations of capital Interests in
the United States, the methods of which
have always passed the understanding of
Old World financiers. It was several days
before Europe recognized the fallacy of
such deductions.
All the authorities agree that the key
note of the financial situation last week
was the copper position. Even West Afri
cans, Rands and "West Australians fluctu
ated in sentimental harmony with the
American market as it rose or fell In con
sequence of the varying light thrown upon
the Anaconda failure to pay the expected
dividend.

CROCKETT, Sept. 29.â While the sailor3
of the English ships now in port were
gathered last night In Murphy's saloon
discussing the yacht race they got into an
argument with several Crockett young
men. Of course the Englishmen shouted
for Lipton's boat and the -result of the
debate was that from words the two par
ties came to blows and the town boys got
much the worst of the encounter.
Elated by their victory, the Britishers
imbibed more 'alf and 'alf to celebrate the
event. In the meantime the town boys
obtained about fifty recruits and bore
down in force upon the exuberant foreign
ers.
A battle royal now took place, in which
the Englishmen were all placed hors de
combat. To-day they were all nursing
broken, heads and noses.
Sailor Jumps From Occidental and
Four Chinese Die.
The ship Occidental arrived from the

him from duty and a watch was placed
over him. He made his escape one night,
however, and jumped from the forecastle
head into the sea. The ship was hove to
and a boat lowered, but no trace of the
unfortunate fellow could be found. He
was a native of Ireland and only 27 years
old.
During the voyage four Chinese died and
their bodies were brought to San Fran

DEATH SATLS ON SHIP, ?
PBAISE FOR YACHTSMEN.
British. Critics Describe the First Con-
test as Magnificent.
LONDON, Sept. 29.â To-day's papers are
unanimous In their praise of the splendid
handling of the Columbia and the Sham
rock II Saturday, in what all describe
as a magnificent race. The outcome has
greatly raised the hopes of British
yachtsmen generally. The yachts are
seen to be so evenly matched that the re
sult cannot be predicted, but it is con
sidered that the triangular course will
prove more favorable for the challenger,
and that therefore Sir Thomas still has
a chance to lift the cup.
"The race throughout could not have
been contested more keenly," says the
Daily Mail, "or in a more sportsmanlike
manner."
The Dally Graphic points Â» to the fact
that at no period in .the race was the
challenger leading by the amount of her
handicap, and it expresses the opinion
that unless the Shamrock II shows a
sudden Improvement in speed she will
hardly win the cup. This latter opinion
's the least hopeful among those voiced
by the morning press.
The Standard, which declines to attach
importance to f he talk of .unsportsman
like conduct on the part of Captain Barr,
which it suggests could doubtless be
traced to idle gossip, .adds: . . , ,
"We are quite sure the yachtsmen of
New York would much rather lose than
owe a seeming victory to such practices."
"It would be a thousand pities," says
the Daily Chronicle, "if . the struggle
should arouse any acrimonious; disputes
of this nature. If everything done by
Captain Barr is In exact accordance .with
American rules, we presume these rules
cannot be questioned; but we hope no
body will deem.it necessary to raise any
question." 'Â¦ Â¦-
The Times says: "The quality of the
Shamrock II, or possibly her slight supe
riority in windward work, will- not be a
compensation for the-. Columbia's dread
ed superiority In a dead run before the
wind in light airs". Therefore, If 'the
weather does- not change there is 'little
likelihood that'f the "challenger will win
the cup, apart V from ii the fresh chance
which the triangular course will give
her. The best \ hdpes llle in a decided
freshening ofithe breeze."- '.:â¢ v.<
GLASGOW. Sept. 29.â Clyde yachtsmen
frankly admit-, that - the . Columbia is a
marvelously good -yacht.- They consider
the fact that a. two-year-old yacht should
have hung so close to the counter of the
Shamrock II when running â¢ free makes
the contest more difficult even for the
British. Yachtsmen and designers alike
declare that if Shamrock- II is to win the
cup she ought to have beaten the Colum
bia by nearer than three minutes on the
turn to windward. Surprise is expressed
that the challenger, should not have saved
the time allowance in the run before the
-wind.
NEW YORK. Sept 29.-An anxious
but determined lot of yachts
men gathered at the New York
Yacht Club to-night for another
talk over yesterday'3 exciting
race, the chances of the Columbia in her
next contest with the Shamrock II on
Tuesday, but above all. that, dreaded
question of the prospects of the famous
cup at last returning whence It came,
after being In American hands a brief
month over half a century/ y
The anxious members seemed to be In
the majority, although the grim air of
determination not to give up the cup was
quite prevalent. Every member frankly
admitted that he had experienced some
thing like a scare and no one wanted to
see the Columbia win another race by so
close a martin. *'*'iL'\.''*
The bulletin board on which was tacked
the committee's brief summary of yester
day's race was the chief attraction at the
club, and before it all evening was a
croup of more or less expert amateur
skippers debating the question of what
the Columbia would be able to accomplish
in the triangular race on Tuesday. Every
one hopes for the best and many recalled
that during the preliminary racing with
the Constitution and Independence the
Morgan boat had shown much speed
when sailing with started sheets.
Fast Bace Is Expected.
In the race on Tuesday, if the wind
holds true, two of tne legs of the tri
angle will be sailed under these con
ditions: One of the legs, probably the
lirst, will be of ten miles to windward,
the next will be a broad reach under the
large Jib topsails or balloon Jibs, while
the third leg will be a close fetch to the
finish line. On these two reaches .all the
racers have shown great speed and the
Columbia frequently made the ten miles
of the triangular race in something under
three-quarters of an hour. . It is said that
the Shamrock II has shown a good four
teen knot gait in a reach, which is a
trifle better than the Columbia has done,
but such timing cannot be considered
absolutely reliable. At any rate, with a
good breeze, the race on Tuesday should
be a fast one.
Much will depend upon the positions of
tin boats at the start, but at the yacht
club to-night there seemed to be the
utmost confidence in Captain Barr of the
Columbia, despite the fact that he was
out-generaled yesterday by the skipper of
the Shamrock. With the Columbia hold
ing the weather position at the start it
seemed to be the general opinion that
she would keep it to the first turn. But
here came the question of the American
boat's ability to hold the Irishman in the
next two legs. With her long lines there
were manv who seemed to think' that the
challenger might out-foot the defender
and that Captain Barr's only resource
would be in a hot luffing match.
That there will be an attempt by one
or the other skipper to luff out to wind
ward in the two reaching legs on Tues
day's race seems almost certain, pro
vided, of course, tne yachts are anyway
close at the first mark or end of ' the
beat to windward.
Captain Barr has been singularly suc
cessful all the season In his luffing
matches, with the exception of that with
the Constitution in the run from New
Haven to New London during the cele
brated cruise last month. ! He certainly
won the last race with the Constitution
by sharp sailing, and there ' were several
other occasions where he obtained a
decided advantage by such tactics, which
it may be said are perfectly fair and
honorable. It is on this that the members
of the New York Yacht Club are relying
to win Tuesday's race, the ability :bf Cap
tain Barr to berth his boat tar- windward
at the start, his sklllfulness In . holding
her there to the windward mark,, the
speed of the Columbia on a. reach and
finally, if lacking slightly In these, speed
on the home run. Again Captain Barr's
cleverness in "a. stiff luffing match Is taken
into account.
Yachtsmen Are Anxious.
If Captain Barr can win Tuesday's race
the clubmen will heave a long sigh of re
lief, but until that triangular course con
test is decided in favor of thÂ§ Columbia'
the cup will be considered, if not in actual
danger of returning, at least as rocking in
its glass case In its depository.
The owners, captains and crews of the
racers spent a quiet day at Sandy Hook
to-day. Captain Barr visited some friends
on shore, but Captain Sycamore remained
on board the Puerto Rico, the Shamrock's
tender, all day.
Soon after noon the revenue > cutter
Gresham anchored in the bay Just ahead
of the Erin. As soon as she arrived Sir
Thomas LSpton made up a party includ
ing George L. Wilson. Mr. and Mrs. Jame
son, the Duke of Alba, Dr. Mackay, Com
modore Hillyard and Robert Ure, and
boarded the cutter in his steam launch.
His purpose was not to find fault with
Captain Walker of the Gresham for run
ning down the Erin during Saturday's
race, but rather tot assure him that the
damage was trifling, and at the same time
repay a social call which the captain and
Mrs. Walker had paid him recently.
Sir Thorns and his party were shown all
over the Gresham. and Mrs. Jameson was
entertained by Mrs. Walker, Mrs. Hall and
Miss Hall. After leaving the Gresham
Sir Thomas* party at the invitation of
Butler Ames, owner of the schooner yacht
America, the famous cup winner of fifty
years ago, went on board that schooner
and took a sail down the bay. Later Sir
Thomas said:
Doesn't Blame Walker.
"Captain Walker of the Gresham and I
are old friends and the fact that his boat
ran Into mine accidentally will not mar
FAILURE MAKES
HIM A SUICIDE
i â¢
the friendship for a moment. The damage
is not so very serious. It will necessitate
docking the ship of course, but that can
be done after the races. As long as no
one was hurt on board the yacht I shall
not grumble at all, because It might have
been so much worse, you know.'
When asked If he wished to say any
thing concerning the alleged story that his
captains had sold him out last year, Sir
Thomas said:
"That Is an old story which I denied
some time ago. I really don't care to say
anything more about It Just now."
Of Saturday's race he declared he had
nothing: to say except to repeat that with
a good, strong breeze the Shamrock would
do better than she did on Saturday. .
From the outside the dent In the port
quarter of the Erin where the Gresham
struck her shows a deep depression In the
sheer strake plate. Just abaft the gang
way ladder. The after end of the plate
is pushed in and some of the rivets are
sheared. - The wooden wearing piece or
molding at the waterways is splintered,
but a little paint will cover up the dam
age temporarily. At the same time con
siderable damage has been done 'Inside,
the end of a beam having buckled, and
to repair this and the plate it will require
several weeks In dry dock, so said a naval
architect to-day, and the expenditure of
quite a sum of money.
Mrs. William F. Jameson, who was re
ported seriously hurt by being thrown
down when the vessels came together, was
looking as bright and cheerful as . ever
to-day. , .
I am not on crutches, you see," said
she, laughing:, "although I was hurt a
little."

English , Specialist^ Says

From Gout.
Ira D. Orton, A, O. Wilkens and Cap
tain Wilson, all of whom are residents
of this city, have purchased valuable
interests on Swedisn Gulch. The deal;
which is one of the biggest made In that
country, was consummated just before
Mr. Metson left Nome. . < >
i He further stated that he did not care 'to
listen to any criticism of Judge Noyes and did
not want his name even mentioned save
where the record made it Â¦ imperative. The
first case which the new Judge took up 'was
Mongollon vs. Mclntosh, in which Judge
Noyes made so many conflicting orders that
General Randall found it necessary to place
his soldiers in charge after Noyes left. Judge
Wickersham decided the case quickly.
He further stated that he would not allow
,any lawyer to talk to him privately about any
case under consideration, and that any busi
ness inrelation to any case must be transacted
in the presence of opposing counsel. Judge
Wickersham' s inaugural announcement struck
the right vein with the people of Nome and
he became popular at once.
The new discoveries practically triple the
value of Anvil Creek properties. Grass Gulch,
Hannum, Boulder and Cunningham Creek and
the lower five claims on Dahl Creek turned
out quite rich. I look for an exceptionally big
boom In that section next year.
Judge Wickersham, who was sent to Nome
to take the place of Judge Noyea, who will
soon be tried by the Circuit Court of Appeals
on a charge of contempt. Impressed me as be
ing an honest, conscientious Jurist, whose
spirit of Justice and fairness will make him
popular in that section. Upon assuming
charg* Judge Wickersham publicly announced
from the bench that he would be in court
every day and would do his best to dispose of
the many controversies over mining property
as quickly as possible. .
The mlnine and business Interests* of Nome
were in a healthy state of improvement when I
left there on the 16th of this month. Unex
pected discoveries of cold on. Anvil and other
creeks, in the immediate vicinity of Nome
buoyed up the spirits of the disgruntled, and
business picked up marvelously. Two addi
tional Day streaks have been discovered ou
Anvil Creek, and they take in the claims that
were thought to be blanks.
William H. Metson of the local law
firm of Campbell, Metson & Campbell,
who has been in Nome all summer, ar
rived home last night.. Mr. Metson is the
attorney for the Pioneer Mining Com
pany. Attorney Metson's confidence in
the Nome country as a gold producing
section was considerably strengthened
toward the end of this season when ad
ditional rich discoveries were made on
Anvil Creek, Grass Gulch and other
tributaries of the famous Anvil Creek.
Before leaving Nome, Metson, who was
foremost in the fight against Judge Noyes
and his allies, had the supreme satisfac
tion of seeing Judge WicKersham, form
erly of Eagle City, take charge of the
judicial affairs of the new camp. Regard
ing conditions in Nome Mr. Metson said:
The river steamer J. C. Powers left St.
Michael on September 15 for the last voy
age of the year up the Yukon.
In longitude 148 degrees, 47 minutes and
latitude 53 north, the Rosecrans passed
the brigannne Courtneyford in a partly
damaged condition. Her main topmast,
fore topmast and fore topgallant mast
were gone. She was spoken by the Rose
crans and reported that she was dismast
ed seventeen days out of Port Townsend
and was making good time.
The Rosecrans left St. Michael for Port
land, via Nome and Dutch Harbor, on
September 15. It was at Dutch Harbor
that the passengers and crew learned of
the shooting of President McKinley. They
did not hear of his death, however, until
this morning when they entered the
mouth of the Columbia River.
General Randall, commanding the De
partment of Alaska, will leave St. Michael
on the transport Seward in a few days
and will take up his headquarters at Van
couver Barracks.
The remaining passengers on the Rose
crans are nearly all Government em
ployes and employes of the consolidated
companies of Alaska, who are coming
either to remain permanently or to spend
the winter. Of tne troops, 199 are to be
stationed at Vancouver Barracks, having
spent their years in Alaska, while 205 of
them were brought out because their term
of service will expire before the opening
of navigation next year. Â¦ . >
PORTLAND. Or.. Sept. 29.â The United
States army transport Rosecrans arrived
in port to-night, fourteen days from St.
Michael. The Rosecrans brought 427
United States troops, under the command
of Captain Wright. They are as follows:
Company F, Seventh United â¢ States In

States Infantry, y7; unassigned, 205; hos

President Rooeevelt knows Germany and has
learned to esteem it by personal studies. His
indorsement of the reciprocity treaties will
bring both countries nearer to each other eco
nomically and Increase their common inter
ests. In 'wishing' to maintain the friendship
and guarantee the peaceful development and
national work of both nations the President of
the great republic will meet with the co-opera
tion of the German people and Government.
The National Zeltung says:
We hope that thi* is President Roosevelt's
conviction and no conventional phrase. A sen
sible American policy has no reason to antag
onize Germany.
The tariff discussion continues in a more
-lively manner. The meeting of the Verein
Fuer Social Polltik, embracing all the
leading German economists, met at Mu
nich tnis week and engaged in a lengthy
Ciscussion of the tariff bill. The criticisms
of the measure were loudly applauded,
and the sentiment that "German export
business is well suited to be the founda
tion of our economic system" met with
strong approval. While no vote was
taken, the general opinion was strongly
against the tariff bill.
The Chambers of Commerce of Essen,
XJochum, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Duis
burg, Muelheim, Ruhrort and Osnabrueck
have held a joint meeting at Essen and
passed a resolution to the effect that an
increase of the grain duties was necessary
and at minimal figures, not too high, but
the chambers rejected the minimal sys
tem altogether on the ground that it en
dangered the renewal of the treaties.
In the meantime the feud between the
agrarians and the manufacturers grows
sharper. The Deutsche Tages Zeltung, a
leading agrarian organ, prints a list of
manutacturers who oppose an increase of
the agricultural schedule, with figures
showing that an increase on their own
manufactures is much greater than on the
produce of agriculture.
Eeports in the provincial press from
Berlin eay Count von Bulow, the Imperial
Chancellor, recently admitted that a re
vision of the tariff bills in important
points was necessary.
The newspapers here make favorable
comment on President Roosevelt's letter
to Professor Hugo Munsterberg, profes
sor of experimental philosophy at Har
vard University, In which the President
eays he has at heart the warmest friend
ship between Germany and the United
States. The Tageblatt says;
The hastening of Prince Chun's return and
the selection or hie route correspond with the
wlEh of the German Government, whtch con
sider* it important that the character of the
mission be not obscured, and it would have re
carded It as being a directly unfriendly atti
tude on the part of the Chinese Government if
Jt had permitted the mission to visit other
capitals and be lionized. According: to the
peace treaty Germany alone could be regarded
as the mission's destination.
Although the semi-oflicial press denied
the correctness of the story that the Ger
man Government has hastened Prince
Chun's departure, the Lokal Anzeiger
again makes the assertion as follows:
The papers argue that a strong feeling
exists at the court against the municipal
ity. Some of them connect the above In
cidents with the re-eiection of Heir Kauff
man as Vice Mayor after the Emperor
had once refused to confirm him.
His Majesty has also rejected three
monuments and the plans for one new
bridze at Berlin.
BERLIN, Sept. 29.â The papers have
been engaged in a warm controversy this
week over Emperor William's refusal to
receive the Mayor of Berlin on the sub
ject of running the city's electric railroad
across Unter den Linden. While the pa
pers representing the municipality's \iews
admit his Majesty has a legal right to
forbid the road from crossing the thor
oughfare, they point to the hardship for
the city Involved in such a decision.

Mons of the royal train arrived here this
afternoon on time. The station and hotel
buildings were gayly decorated with flags,

dered the Duke and Duchess was most
cordial.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 29.â The roy

Glacier Is Gayly Decorated.
The Canadian Pacific Hotel In Field was
beautifully ' decorated with evergreens,
banners and flags. At the entrance to the
hotel was an evergreen arch inscribed
with the words, "Welcome to. British Co
lumbia." The population of the town was,
as has been the. case all through j the
West, on the station platform eagerly
awaiting the arrival of the royal party
and the reception tendered them was. en
thusiastic and hearty.
FIELD, B. C, Sept. 29.â This morning
dawned bright, clear and cold at Banff
and the beauty of the scene as the sun
rose over the mountain peaks, covered by
their mantles of snow, called forth ex
clamations of pleasurable delight from
those on board the royal train, who were
early astir. After breakfast a start was
made, the first section leaving Banff for
Vancouver at 8:15 o'clock, followed short
ly afterward by the second section, with
the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and
York on board. The run to Laggan,
where the first stop, was made, was a
most enjoyable one, for as the sun be
came stronger and brighter the lights and
shadows of the mountains became more
distinct. The day was absolutely perfect
for viewing the glories of Canada's great
range. Not a cloud was visible in the
sky, which showed a deep blue above
peak and valley.
At Laggan, B. C, the station wa.Â« taste
fully, decorated with evergreens and flags,
while the small population of the place
Â¦was out- in full force on -the station plat
form to get a " view of the royal train
and, If possible, to catch a glimpse of, the
Duke and Duchess. ' The children carried
Union Jacks In their hands and gave a
hearty and loyal welcome to the future
sovereign and his royal consort when they
appeared on the platform. â¢ . .
The stay at Laggan was brief. During
the stop everybody left the cars and en
joyed a walk in the brisk mountain air
and bright sunshine. The Premier of Can
ada. Sir Wilfred Laurler, spent the time
chatting with friends. on the station plat
form. .
Bach Town Gives Greeting.
During a brief stop of the pilot special
at Revelstoke late in the afternoon the
Countess of Mlnto laid the corner-stone of
Victoria Memorial College Hospital, the
fourth of the kind organized in Western
Canada. The Countess of Minto organized
the movement for the establishment of
hospitals at remote places unable to sup
port a large hospital.
The Canadian Pacific officials used every
possible precaution to guard 'against ac
cident. The track was carefully patrolled
at every danger point arid a guard stood
at every : switch. : The divisional Â¦ officials
were all : on duty and personally super
vised the handling of the royal specials.
The Countess of Minto and several mem
bers-of her party made the ride down the
loops from Glacier to Illeflllewaet on ths
cow-catcher platform of the engine of the
pilot special. .They all enjoyed the thril
ling experience.
The royal passengers got away from
Banff at 8:30 o'clock in the morning. The
entire population of the little mountain
town turned out to see them oft and cheer
the royal couple. On through the moun
tains until long after night had settled
down there were crowds at all E the sta
tions for a glimpse of the Duke and Duch
ess.
t They were particularly interested in
Kicking Horse Pass and glacier at
Glacier. The royal train was run very
slowly through the former and stopped
at the latter. There was ample time for
the observation of beauty. /' Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦' Â¦Â¦'.'Â¦ '

sustaining damage Immediately after the
arrival off Santiago. Though the sea was
not rough, there was a heavy swell on the
afternoon of May 26 and on May 27, which
made coaling dangerous. The American
men-of-war had not had much practice
in coaling at sea and the experience of the

Signals and the Loop.
The squadron ' was directed by signals
made by the direction of Commodore
Schley to -attack the Colon at a range
of 7000 yards. \ Commodore Schley was not
responsible for the failure of the captains
of the fleet to obey the signaj. The block

though ordered to Santiago, the squad

a course that Â¦would have brought it to
the* coast of Haiti, finally stopping' at a
point twenty-five miles southeast of the
Cuban port. Without undertaking to coal,

so, and without endeavoring to obey the

In his communication to the. Senate
Naval Committee, Schley asserted that he
left Cienfuegos at seventeen minutes after
5 o'clock on the afternoon of May 24. He
did not leave until 8 o'clock. The Mar
blehead .signaled the fleet of the appear
ance of a strange vessel. The fleet lay
to at quarters, but no attempt was made
to board the suspfcious. vessel and ascer

traband of war. / ./
The Failure to Coal.
Coaling operations were carried on at
Cienfuegos showing 1 , that the sea was not
too heavy to have prevented Schley from
sending ashore and establishing commun

seen which caused .considerable discussion
among the officers" of the fleet, but noth
ing 'was done to investigate them.
From the i>ofnt of view of . the Navy
Department the . evidence thus far ad
duced before the court of inquiry has fully
established Its charge that Rear Admiral
Schley was guilty of reprehensible con
duct during the Santiago campaign. Rear
Admiral Schley, knowing his own destin
ation and aware that the Marblehead had
just left Cienfuegos, should have signaled
to Commander McCalla to board the
Brooklyn and acquaint him with the con
ditions at that point.
Sampson's frinds are equally confident
of a decision against Schley for these rea

"Whereas, The daily Examiner, of, San "Francisco has, through its columns.
\erily, it would appear that the workingmen of. San Francisco have reason. to
pray to be delivered from their friends. God knows that in the struggle now
on their loV is -a hard one. . Deprived of labor themselves, there is want in thÂ»
home3 or thousands. The conditions that have kept the necessities of life from
wives and children would long since have ceased, and the trouble would now be
over, but for the Examiner's course. And now this demagogic priest., whoso
occupation and prominence gives weight to what he may say. no matter how
unreasonable and ridiculous, adds fuel to the fire and urges strikers to a course
that means their utter ruin should they follow his advice.
;, The Stockton Daily Independent, on September 28, published the. fol
lowing- editorial r ~ '/ , :_"--; 1
"As of old the refractory slaves were lashed hito obedience, so now American
citizens in San Francisco are to be clubbed into slavery. How long will ye stand
it, ye wage earners of San Francisco?"
W^at Is it that this -priestly Yorke would have the laborers of San Fran
cisco do?^ Does he wish them to arm themselves and correct the evils he claims
exist with rifle and bayonet? Does he advocate the shedding of blood because
a policeman exceeds his duty? Granted for the sake of argument that the po
lice are guilty of the crimes of clubbing the inoffensive, robbing the unwary
and acting "as never did the police of. Russia act," does this hot-headed priest ad
vise the handful of strikers to take the law in their own hands?
"Before I close let me say one word on the general question of violence I
have warned the men against it. but I am beginning to cast in my mind If there
be not worse things than violence. Violence is to be reprobated when the law
protects you, but if the law is perverted, what then? The action of the Dolice
In this city, especially within the past few days., has been intolerable I have
seen an old man with gray hair and of venerable aspect ridden down and
clubbed by one of Sullivan's Bashl Bazouks. Every hour peaceable citizens are
held up, searched. . robbed, assaulted and there appears to be no remedy Never
in Russia did the police act as they are acting to-day on the water front* of San
Francisco and in our streets. .
"People of California, what Is done to-day to the longshoremen may be done
to you to-morrow.
. ' "Wage earner of San' Francisco, will you stand by and see your brethren
clubbed into submission to the Employers' Association?
In his latest article he wrote:
He devotes column after column to a senseless scolding of The Call hut as
.this is purely a personal matter, the public has little concern, with it. Whe'n how
ever, the priestly agitator openly advises violence and disobedience of the' laws
his utterances become significant. *
A FOOLISH ADVISER.
The Irreverend Peter C. Yorke is amusing himself and disgusting the Dublle
by publishing in the Examiner a series of articles that for choice invective and
unbridled abuse would not be decent in a layman, but which in his position ia
positively shocking.
The Mayor sent the Examiner a positive denial, declaring he had said nothing
of the kind, and that th'e accusation was wholly false. The denial was shown to
the priest, and In yesterday's Examiner it appears side by side with a communi
cation from nim in- which he has. the impudence to repeat the original assertion
and to say that it Is borne out by an affidavit from Andrew Furuseth, also
printed.
The affidavit wholly fails to support the priest's position. In fact, the only
words it attributes to the Mayor are these:
"I have listened to your story and I think you ought to go to work. The duty
of the city government Is clear. We must have peace al all-hazarda."
The affidavit concludes with an expression of opinion from Furuseth to thÂ«
effect that he came from an interview with the Mayor impressed with the idea
that "the clubbing of peaceable, Innocent men would continue until they would
consent to resume work." But Furuseth is very careful not to put any such
words in, the Mayor's mouth.
If the matter were not so serious. Father Yorke would appear supremely ri
diculous by this weak and foolish attempt to bolster up his false and slander
ous charge. His brazen repetition of so great a falsification, coupled with fur
ther low appeals to the passions and prejudices of the strikers, â¢ is disgraceful
and indecent, and tends to bring reproach upon the sacred calling which he pro
fesses, v - â¢' ' . ,
To discerning persons it is plain that no statement of fact -which Father
Yorke may hereafter make is entitled to belief, In this or any other controversy.
The Daily Californian, of Bakersfield, published the following editorial
on September 27:
On Thursday last the Examiner reported Father Peter C. Yorke as havln*
charged Mayor Phelan with saying, regarding the strikers: >.
â¢ "IÂ£ they don't -want to be clubbed, let them go to work."
A GROSS FALSIFICATION BRAZENLY REPEATED.
' The time is not far distant when the workingmen of San Francisco will
use of and concerning Peter C. Yorke the same bitter language they now employ
in mentioning the hated name of Harry Knox.
The following is also from the Sacramento Bee of September 28:
And yet he cares not, so long as he can flount himself in the light of day.
Peter C. Yorke cares no more for the workingmen of San Francisco than for
the dust under his feet. He is infatuated only with his own notoriety. If he
were not delirious with the publicity which environs him he might pause to
consider that the counsel he Is giving the workingmen of San Francisco is that
of a man who preaches the blessings of suicide. He knows the cause for which
he shrieks is lost. He knows the advice which he furnishes points to the
Tarpeian rock, over which the strikers will' dash themselves if they follow
where he beckons.
The words of Peter C. Yorke in Thursday's Examiner mean Â» nothing less
than that. ' No other , interpretation can be put upon them by any one who
comprehends the meaning of English words.
There is a "soggarth" in San Francisco, but none of the "aroon" attaches
to him. \ . . ' .
Instead of preaching peace he advocates disturbance. In place of directing
his flock in the ways of moderation he endeavors to Incite them, to deeds of
turbulence. 'When disorder occurs he blackguards the authorities who have
endeavored to preserve the peace and protect the citizens from assault and
murder. When tae laws are being violated and men are assaulted and maimed
for- no other crime, than an endeavor to work In order to support their wives
and their children, he shrieks- at the police who are trying to maintain order,
and denounces, in the most atrocious billingsgate, honest, upright, generous and
manly American citizens Â¦ whose only crime is that they have the audacity to
endeavor to conduct their, own In his French-Revolution harangues
<he, has been"" as7 'sparing of the truth in his statements as ' of - common decency
in his language. ' J "' <Â¦ ' Â¦ .Â¦'.. Â¦ ;
., ClSth^&'^vlth the"* authority ~6f' a Catholic priest, he has acted," not as a
counselor, but as a firebrand; not as one pointing the way to peace and moder
ation, but as one inciting to assault and riot. When labor leaders have advised
their followers to tread the ways of quiet protest, it has remained for this
alleged man of God to harangue them to deeds of desperation. With all the
demagogy and little of the cunning sagacity of Mark Antony he has
endeavored to incite the very stones of San Francisco to mutiny, to riot and
to crime. Instead . of counseling his hearers to obey the law and to respect an
authority exerted only to maintain order and protect the lives of American
citizens, he has denounced the preservers of the peace as criminals and haÂ»
endeavored â by every artifice known to a demagogue who has no regard for
truth, no respect for the rights of citizens and no consideration for upright
Americans whom he malignsâ to precipitate the strikers into a combat with thÂ«
authorities.
Time was when the "soggarth aroon" went among the poor, dealing out
charity and lo\'lng kindness to all, tending the sick, ministering: to the dying,
and not only offering prayers for the dead but giving good counsel and fatherly
advice to the quick.- â¢ He taught his flock not only how to die, but as well how
to live. Ho instilled" into them the doctrine oÂ£ affection, not the creed or
hate. He taught them for all mankind, not bitterness against political
, opponents and malice to employers. He Inculcated In them a regard for order,
an obedience to the 'law, a submission to necessary and salutary authority,
and a love for their, country. In times of heated industrial turmoil he cham
pioned when they were right and eluded when they wore wrong. But as he
,. championed he counseled. He ever preached the ways of peace: He ever
warned against violence and riot. He ever stood by the side of his flockâ with
. one hand keeping back to the extent of his power those who would wrong them,
and with the other restraining his children from overt actsâ the while be
preached moderation and that gospel of ChriÂ«t:
. : "Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you."
The most lovable type of the "soggarth aroon" ever known on the Padflo
Coast was the priest and hero of Virginia City, Patrick Manogue, who died ,
as Bishop of Sacramento. In the Jurbulent times of the Comstock he was the
idol of the Miners' Union. There w'as n.> miner's home in all that section. where
the" wife did not pray every night for God to .bless Patrick Manogue. There was
not a house â be it of the rich or of the poor â In which he was not welcome. .
Doing God's work humbly and faithfully, he hesitated neither to reproach Capi
tal nor to criticise and even to lecture Labor. He feared only to do wrong.
In his humble sphere he was as the heart of Bruce, which the Scots threw
ahead of them In battle in the hour of their desperation, and, casting them
selves upon the foe, cried out: "Heart of Bruce, we follow thee!"
In the darkest days of the laborers on the Comstock they exclaimed with
one voice (Protestants as well as Cathelics): "Direct, Father Manogue, and we
obey!"
On one wild night In Virginia C:ty h-> stopped the hotheads of the Miners*
Union from deeds of desperation and crime. In all that camp of excitement and
of fierce will he was the only man with the influence and the pluck to stem
the current- of riot' and violence. And before the sun had reached its meridian
on the morrow he had exacted from the bonanza kings a promise that the
men. should all go back to work at the wages which they asked and to which
- they were entitled. . . ' .
That was the "soggarth aroon" of Virginia City and Sacramento.

There are things that need to be said, and that can be said NOW. , . ,

Is nil life hereafter to be lived in a graveyard by Americans and by American Journal
ism lest when death comes to a public man the severe word, Ihe light* word and the funny
jilcture may be produced in the death chamber?â New York '^Journal, September 22. . â¢
So this is the apology. Is itâ this the defense? \ You r- were "human,":''ani
mated" and â¢â¢entertaining"' In your assaults on the late chief magistrate? - it
was merely -political controversy," was it. that fined your columns in Â¦Â¦ your
presentation of and comment upon the 'policies of the .McKinley administra
tion in peace and war? It is only "light" werds or ."severe" 'words -that you
have spoken about social Institutions and prominent men generally? So you
say, so you ezcote yourself.
Then it was '-human" and "animated" to intimate by parallel the violent
death of William McKinley within five years? It was "entertainine" to pre
dict "an awful bloodv Quarrel" between him, "the Commander-in-Cnlef,
who had surrendered the control of the army and navy to the trusts."
and the "American peasant." to whom he had "tossed the answer 'the
trusts can do no -wrrons' " with his "fat. white hand." You say it was.
It was only a "lieht" or possibly a "severe" wordâ illustrated. by "funnv"
pictures, which we have been requested repeatedly to reproduce, but which for
decency's sake, we have declinedâ to name him as "an obedient lellvflsh." a
"Doliticastro." cue "ready to surrender every particle of national honor
and dismitv"P So you have written it down. ;
it was your notion of "politiaal controversy" to call him "an abiect.
weak, futile, incompetent poltroon," "bar one. the most despised and
hated creature on the hemisphere, his name hooted, his nsrure burned
in efflev." So you have said in plain print.-
There are other "light" or "severe" words on which stress might be laid. Such
is your advice to anarchists to leave things alone and come and blow up Amer
ican bankprs. manufacturers and corporation presidents. Such is your exhorta
tion, to society to treat a certain rich man "like a wild beast" â merely because
he Is a rich man. Such is your complaint after a collision between police and
rioters that "there have not been enough shot. No trust manager has ever had
a scratch." But we shall confine- the relation to these "light" words you spoke of
IVilliam McKinley. , . .
They "human"? They "animated"? They "entertaining"? They the language
of "political controversy"? When you" say so, Hearst, you flee for refuge within
that illimitable comparison of the martyr, who said of your pupil, "Poor fellow, he
did not know what he was doing." You palliate, in so grotesque a distortion of
the plain meaning of words your morai monstrosity with mental deficiency. You
proclaim that your counsel has advised you, too. that "your only defense is in
eaiiity." As your accomplice would escape in the straltjacket of the lunatic so
would you In the motley of the fool. - . Â¦ .. .-
The Nashville (Tenn!) American said editorially on September 24:
FROBLEM OF YELLOW JOURNALISM.
The Chancellor of Syracuse University, James R. Day, upon being questioned
by the New York Journal for an expression upon PresidentMcKinley, sent the
following: ... , ; Â¦ :. . Â¦' . : â¢ :
Samuel Hicks, General Manager New York
Journalâ Dear Sir: Will you please never send to
this office any matter bearing the "imprint of the
New York Journal ? I loathe the New York Journal
as I do the unspeakable wretch who shot our great
President. I believe your paper, more than any other
agency in this country,' helped to make the conditions
which encouraged such assassination. To have our
institution commended by such a paper would be a
[burning disgrace. ; JAMES R. DAY.
But what difference does this make to the Journal? The leading preachers,
lawyers, politicians and editors erf New York City continue to write for its'col
umris. No New York paper can boast of such a stanT of special contributors. As
long as eminent leaders of thought earn pin money writing for the Journal, how
Is the "common herd" to know its other pages reeking with foul scandal, and
sensational fakes should be shunned?
When the Maine was destroyed the Journal telegraphed over the country
asking prominent citizens to accopt a place on its committee to erect a national
monument by popular subscription to' the men who went down with the Maine.
Most of the prominent citizens. Governors, etc.. accepted. One of the invitations,
however, was addressed to the Hon. Gnover Cleveland, and was answered In
this manner:
PRINCETON*. N. J., FÂ«>b. 58. 1898.â To W. ,R. Hearst. New York Journal, New Torkâ I
decline to allow my Borrow for those who died on the Maine to be perverted to an adver
tising Bcheme for the New. York Journal. GRQVER CLEVELAND.
Mr. Cleveland's 'was the dignified and sensible answer to a cheeky request,
what business was Jt of a newspaper's to raise a monument to the Maine's vic
tims?
But it Is difficult to draw the line between honest and intelligent criticism of
public officers and the ravings of the yellow Journals -which' hold them up with
pencil and brush as enemies of mankind. r .
Â¦ The yellow journal evil is well summed up by a Minnesota Congressman,
who says:
The evil of yellow Journals consists' in their pandering to the worst tastes of the Ignorant
and depraved. Intelligent readers are not affected by their utterances, or by the persistent
reiteration of false charges against public men. But to the uneducated man, coming from
a foreign country, and knowing little of American institutions, the vilest cartoons and the
moet Impossible accusations are taken at their face value. This man knows that in Aus
tria. Germany or Russia the Government would not allow such pictures to be printed or
utich charge* to be repeated, and the fact that they are published here in every conceivable
form is evjdence to his mind that they are true. He is not a wide reader, and some cheap
and pestiferous sheet is probably the only thing he ever sees. He learns from it that the
ruler* of the nation are men of the worst type; that they are personally responsible for pov
erty and misery. He comes to hold them to account for whatever he may himself lack of
the g-ood things of life. What wonder that he becomes a grumbler, and finally an anarchist?
But we are told the people are responsible, that the yellow papers but give
them what they want and that is what they should do. Ought ignorant and
untutored minds be given what they want? Mentally they are children. Do we
Clve children .what they cry for? ..If we did their appetites, would soon become
weak, capricious when satisfied, and not contented with simple and wholesome
food. . . -â¢Â¦Â¦.â¢ '
A minstrel show in town last week gave black-faced representations of Mr
Bryan. Senator Depew. J. Plerpont Morgan and other well-known citizens Of
course., the galleries roared at their antics, and any respect it may have had for
any of these gentlemen vanished when they cake-walked across the stage. This is
an invasion upon the personal liberty of these gentlemen. This Is a free country
but it is the essence of tyranny for a man's personal .' appearance to be carica

The Ledger, of Tacoma,' Wash., published the following in its editor
ial columns on September 25: ;

When the Examiner was charged. with having- created the state of mind' that

him with great Interest. : " ' â¢"Â¦ , " . Â¦ > ' â¢ , â¢ . . \ , . ..

The prime causa of anarchy Is liberty unrestrained by . moral law;

all that was imbecile, all that was merely a tool, forgetful of his oath, forgetful of his honor and forgetful of his
American citizenship and the trust reposed in him by the people?

Was it not an assailant of law and. order, of a good,cause and of good institution when it declared, that
thereupon "an awful," bloody war would break out between. the Commander-in-Chief and the peasant"?
Was it not an assailant of good causes and institutions, of authority, and an assailant of the church
and of the state when it held up to the anarchists the example of Louis XVII, and the peasants of France, with
the King beheaded and the peasants all eatingâ and this in. the self -same article in /which it ; portrayed the
President bating, the peasant starving and the throwing of the ribband to - the peasant by "the white, tat hand"

And with it all; with the blood from, the wounds of the dead President yet undried; with.the grief of the people
yet unassuaged, the New York Journal announces its determination to resume and' to continue the stream of ma
lignity against authority, of vituperation against the Chief Magistrate, and of malevolence against the ' state and
established institutions by the employment of
"Brain and pen and artist's pencil, with argument, cartoon and satire.'" . .

couple have known one another for many
years and for four years their friends
had considered them engaged. A few
weeks ago Goodman did or said some
thing which displeased Miss Shaw and
after that she treated him rather coolly.
The break finally came when he was in
formed that she no longer loved him.
Goodman entreated her not to Judge him
harshly and to give him another oppor
tunity to place himself aright. He visited
her on Friday evening to plead with her.
The girl had determined to inform him
at the outset that she could not alter her
decision. She did so and Goodman
promptly killed himself In her presence.

Specials Tell Straight Stories.
The specials who were fired upon tell
straight and circumstantial stories of the
attack made upon them. Captain Sey
mour questioned % each separately. To
him W. P. Rawley said:
There Â¦was a party of five (of which I was
one) at the Thalia Theater on Turk street.
We left there about 1a.m. A number of men
left the dace at the same time and followed
us down the right-hand side of Market street
to Kearny. '. .
After we had turned on to Kearny street
and were about half a block from Market, and
on the east side of Kearny, we heard several
shots. "W. C. Beehler, one of our number,
said, "I think 1 am hit," and, putting his
liand on his ankle, said, "I am sure I am."
My friends then began shooting at the men
who wtre shooting at us and several police
officers came. "We had had no trouble with
the men nor did we know them.

far as Kearny street with us. About fifty
yards from Market street we crossed to the
east side of Kearny street. The -officer was
still standing at the- corner when we heard
a number of shots fired and Beehler said he
was shot. We then began shooting:, and the
policeman who was on the corner and who was
with U3 came running up to where we were.

us nor did I have any trouble with them.

STRIKERS ASK
REINSTATEMENT
Officers Thomas Murphy and George
Doug-las arrived at this time and started
in to disperse the crowd. They used their
clubs effectively and drove many into
Geary street and others into Morton.
Captain Wittman came running down the
latter street, and although cautioned not
to gro into the affray succeeded in hold-
Ing the crowd at bay until other officers
came up. As a result of the captain's
Tillman tried to drive the crowd back when
the first ehota were fired In the vicinity of
OÂ«ary Etreet at the men who were a few feet
beyond the corner. Somebody in the crowd
there may have been one or twoâ fired at Till

end I Kot out of the way as fait as I could,
but I eaw a number of men et&ndlng in the
street firing at the five men across the street,
who, until after I had been shot, had not fired.
All reports tend to show that the first
shots were fired by the strikers and their
sympathizers. The first attack made was
at LfOtta's fountain, where Officer Till
man made his stand. The five specials
and Rowley crossed to the east side of
.Kearny street, while the strikers scat
tered. Some advanced into the center of
Kearny street, at the Junction of Geary,
some ran up that street, and others
followed along the west side of Kearny
Weapons were discharged indiscrimi
nately on Geary street and at the Junc
tion of Market street, where Earl Ful
lington. the messenger boy. was struck
in tne leg by one of the bullets intended
for Police Officer Tillman. Then the tide
of battle waged northward until the^ spe
cials made a stand on Kearny street, di
rectly opposite Morton. Here the great
est damage was done and the course of
the bullets can be plainly seen.
In front of Harshall's tailor shop at IS
Kearny Etreet the specials began firing.
Their bullets shattered the window In
Raphael's clothing store and others land
ed in the windows of the wholesale de
partment of M. A. Gunst & Co. on Mor
ton street. The heaviest firing was di
rected toward the special officers. Brass
signs on the east side of the street show
many bullet holes. Mme. Pilger's sign,
a few doors below Harshall's place, is
punctured twice and holes can be found
in the door casements.
Two of Harshall's windows were de
stroyed and the brass sign in front of
his place gives evidence of a dozen more
bullets. Further up the street, in the
direction in which the specials retreated,
more signs show that the strikers shot to
kill, for few of their bullets ranged above
the height of an ordinary man's body,
although the majority went low. Many
struck the sidewalk.
Earl Fullington, 17 years of age, was
first wounded. He was standing in front
of the cigar store at the junction of Mar
ket and Geary streets when the attacked
party and Officer Tillman came along.
He saw the riot begin. Hetsays:
Strikers th.e Assailants.
Heretofore strikers have not been

underground resort on Turk street,
whence came the mob of rioters yester
day morning. The place was well chosen.
Â£or all classes of people are wont to con
gregate there, ana the word once passed
around that trouble was brewing would
soon lead to the gathering of many of
the toughest characters In the city.
Not alone was the battle fought on
Kearny street, but every point where a
striker could discharge a weapon, with-^
out regard to the course the bullet might
take, was utilized to carry terror to the
multitude and give an Impression to the
public of the "rights of the strikers."

I AM highly pleased with the stand
taken by the special officers this
morning," said Chief of Police Sulli
van yesterday. "It shows that some
of them are made of the right stuff
and will resist attack. Since the pa-
trol has been established on the water
front, none of the union pickets will dare
venture out after dusk. We have there
fore redoubled our energies In other di
rections. _,We hardly expected that the
strikers would carry their rioting right
into the heart of the city, but they did.
They did not catch us napping, however,
and at the sound of the first pistol shot
officers were hurrying from every direc
tion: It is to be regretted that we did not
have enough officers to surround the dis
trict and prevent the escape of any of the
strikers in the assailing party. This riot
can only be laid at the feet of one man-
Father Yorke."
A blackjack was the only weapon found
by the police when the riot district was
visited yesterday morning. As none of the
men arrested had weapons on them when
searched at the Hall of Justice it is sub
posed they passed them to confederates in
the crowd. The police are investigating
a report that two wounded strikers were
carried down Annie street after the shoot-
Ing, but no trace of them could be found.
Thousands of "people viewed the scene
of the riot yesterday and put their fin
gers in the shattered windows and felt
the bullet holes in the signs. One ques
tion that none could solve was as to
who would be responsible for the* dam
age. ..
Damage to Buildings.
Careful estimates place the loss in plate
glass alone at over $300. Then there is
the damage to sign3 and buildings, awn
ings, etc. It is a well-understood propo
sition that when a riot occurs in a city
the municipal government i3 responsible.
A claim " made against the Brotherhood
of Teamsters, whose members formed a
majority of the rioters, would be futile,
for it is a well-known fact in strike cir
cles that its treasury is depleted. The
matter would therefore come back on the
city, even though the police did every
thing in their power to disperse the crowd
and prevent bloodshed and damage.
Further investigations by the police
seem to indicate that Ward Miller, tha
only man who was seriously injured, was
the man who fired the shot at short
range at Officer Tillman. Miller is de
tained at the Receiving Hospital and at
a late hour was on the way to recovery.
He will not be released until his ante
cedents are inquired into and he gives a
plausible excuse for his presence among
the rioters.
The other wounded men were dis
charged from the Receiving Hospital yes
terday. Young Fullington was the last
to be removed. He was sent to his room.

BATTLE ON KEARNT STREET. EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, WHEN
\\ , FIVE SPECIALS WERE ATTACKED BY A LARGE BODY OF STRIK
ERS. THE PICTURES ARE THOSE. OF THE PERSONS WOUNDED.
That the crisis has been nearly reached
all draymen agree. It Is generally be
lieved that a break is a question of a few
days only, and that_the increase in vio
lence precipitates rather that retards
that result. >
A prominent drayman said yesterday
that the destitution among the teamsters
was so great that it is now a question of
going back to work or starving. The
men have grown exceedingly restive un
der the long strain, and according to au
thentic information they were willing to
quit the fight. Were it not for the fear
of inviting trouble at the' hands of their
fellow-strikers a large per cent of the
teamsters would go to work to-morrow.
The developments in the teamsters*
strike this week will be watched with in
terest by the draymen. There were signs
of a decided break among the fruit team
sters last week, and the Indications.yes
terday were that the discontent among
the fraternity was increasing to the point
that definite action on an important scale
would develop before Wednesday.

DRAYMEN" ARE CONFIDENT.
Of those injured during the night, but

a carpenter." He lives at 822 Howard
street, and claims to have been on his 1
way home. As a bullet pierced his lung,
the physicians at the Receiving Hospital
declined to permit him to talk. -
Patrick Sullivan, employed by the Over
land Freight and Transfer Company, who
was found at the corner of Market and
Geary streets about 1 o'clock yesterday
morning, was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital. He had been' struck on the face
and was unable to see. He said that
eight men had attacked him at the corner
of Third and Market streets. He was

Beehler was suffering greatly with the
wound in his leg, the bone having been
shattered. He said he was glad he es
caped without more serious injuries.
Each one of the strikers arrested is loud
in his protestations of innocence. One
admits that he was in the Thalia, but
says he was thrown out because he was
drunk. The others claim that they were
going in different directions, but happened
to meet in the proximity of the shooting,
being attracted by the noise. They will
be held .until they are able to prove they
had no part in the riot.

Detailed accounts of the sinking of the German torpedo
gunboat Wacht in the Baltic on September 4 -was a case which
will no doubt be serious to the commanding officer. The steer
ing gear of the Wacht had become disabled during the maneu
vers and the vessel was being navigated by an emergency ap
paratus when the collision with the Sachaen took place. The
Wacht was rammed between the engine room and another
compartment, destroy ing. the bulkhead between the two com
partments. All of the crew sprang overboard, only the captain,
first officer and the chief engineer remaining with the ship.
The vessel sank In twenty-two minutes In twenty-flve fathoms
and the Sachscn proceeded to Danzig for repairs. 'Â¦ .

PROSPERITY EVERYWHERE.
BECAUSE the Bohemian Club ordered the. Examiner off the club files apd out
of the clubrooms, Hearst has attacked the club by asserting that a suit for
divorce in this .city owes. its origin. to the fact that the husband in the case
was led to neglect and to ill treat his wife by reason of his association with "dis
solute" members of the club. That lie was refuted yesterday by a statement of the at
torney for the lady and its publication was characterized^ by him as "a dirty trick."
Because The Call, as a part of its business as a legitimate journal furnishing the
public with the news of the day, reports the various expressions of popular indignation
against the yellow journals,' the Examiner has sought to convey the impression that The
Call commended Emma Goldman and her teachings when she was in this city in 1898.
That lie also was refuted yesterday by the republication in The Call of the Goldman inter
view, which the Examiner garbled, and of the editorial on the day following,- in which
anarchy was denounced and the immorality of its teachers exposed by The Call. That
lie of the Examiner then may also be characterized as a dirty trick of the same kind as
the assault on the Bohemian Club. .
The two instances are recalled because they give notice to the public of the methods
by which Hearst will endeavor to retaliate on those who condemn him and his journals.
It will be well for the people to bear them in mind, for there is no telling who will be the 1
next victim of a dirty trick.
The Examiner and the other Hearst journals will have no lack of judges upon
whom to turn their yellow malignancy. Here are some of the judgments that, have
been pronounced upon Hearst and his papers in the East and in the West:
The New York Sun meets the defense published by Hearst in the New York
Journal by saying: "This shameless publication would, have it believed that the impres
sive and destructive condemnation of it which the outraged and indignant American
public has expressed through the reputable press is in fact mere newspaper attack upon it
because of jealousy cf its superior enterprise and novelty. * * * The utter perver
sion of the thing known as yellow journalism was never shown more conclusively or of
fensively than in this hypocritical pretense to exalted motives in connection with other
ends as a cloak to complicity in a crime that has shocked the country."
The New York Post says: "The real offense of yellow journalism is not so much
that it holds a public man U P to undeserved ridicule, or visits upon him censure which he
does not deserve, as that its pervading spirit is one of vulgarity/ indecency, .and .reckless
sensationalism; that it steadily violates the canons alike of good taste and sound morals;
that it cultivates false standards of life and demoralizes its, readers; that it recklessly '.uses
language that may incite the crack-brained to lawlessness; that its net influence makes
the world worse. . A force working to such ends ought surely to be restrained, and public
opinion ought to be brought to bear a'gainst it in the most effective possible- ways." ' /"
The press of California, where .Hearst's methods of, journalism have been paraded
in the Examiner, are as vigorous in condemning him as those of New York, where he is
known by the Journal, and those of Chicago, where he is known by the American. ".
The Los Angeles Express says: "Herr Most has' uttered nothing worse in ;his
viperous den than. has the New York Journal, and Emma Goldman's wicked appeals
from the curbstone have scarcely equaled the editorial ravings of Hearst's Chicago Amer
ican." ... ' , â¢ " : .'Â¦.; " .' â¢Â¦.
The Alameda Argus, after quoting a specimen of the editorials of the Hearst pa-
pers, says: "Anybody who might think this an extract from one of Emma Goldman's
speeches would be mistaken. It is a part of a Hearst editorial which appeared in the New
York Journal barely two months before the President was shot. Is it any wonder that
the people are aroused from one side of the country to the other?" â¢ .. Â¦Â¦
The Santa Clara Journal gives warning to the Examiner in the statement: "There
is a limit to the anarchist teachings of the Hearst papers that will yet cause trouble tp its
proprietor if he fails to observe it." _' â¢ Â¦ ..'â¢.".: -
The Mail of Woodland, in describing the tone of public sentiment on the subject,
says: "The feeling against the Examiner is very strong. While going to the city the
othfcr day we met the newsboy after he had passed through three cars on receiving his
morning papers and were unable to obtain a Call or a Chronicle from him, he having
sold; them all. \ He had a large bundle of Examiners, but was only able to dispose pf
three in the car we were seated in. The people absolutely refused to purchase that
paper and deferred reading the morning news until they arrived in the city."
The Petaluma Argus says of Hearst's three' pipers: /"The 1 opinion very" largely
prevails that these papers are justly condemned for their vituperative, false and malicious
attacks upon Mr. McKinley and the party he so fully and grandly represented. There
seemed to be nothing too severe, nothing tob slimy, false or vituperative for these papers
to hurl at an innocent man', even to the most hatred-breathing epithets and charges
that a vile heart could conceive or pen or tongue could utter .or. express." â¢ Â¦ .â¢ *
The Los Angeles Times says: "The Hearst papers were indecently insulting to
the late chief magistrate and his administration, and more or less so to everything that
stood for law and order. It is entirely proper and fitting that those American citizens
who believe in the maintenance of law and order, who believe- in respectability and de
cency and fairness, should show, their indignation and contempt against these miserable
gutter sheets which pander to the baser passions of . human nature and are to a great
extent responsible for the spread of that spirit of anarchy which found- its latest vent in
the cowardly assassination of the late President." . â .
The Humboldt Standard says: "Such papers as Hearst's Examiner, "Journal, and
Chicago American have reeked with anarchistic rot, foul detraction and cruel calumny
directed at the very man whom Czolgosz slew. The Examiner even went so far as to
suggest the assassination of McKinley after the assassination of Governor Goebel of Ken
tucky." /, ; Â° : Â«' .
Here are further expressions from the East: ' Â° â '
The Philadelphia Sunday Item says: "That abusive and licentious journalism was
largely responsible for the President's assassination is evident to all thinking persons. The
fact that the New York Journal was flooding the land with vile cartoons, deriding and
belittling President McKinley doubtless caused those who favor war with all govern
ments to believe that a large section of the American people were bitterly hostile to him.
It is natural to suppose that their meeting places were plastered with these' cartoons and
that the spirit they breathed made the leaders of the assassination conspiracy! believe that
the time was ripe to strike the blow."
The Chicago Journal, in reviewing the defense made by Hearst's paper in that city,
the American, says: "Hearst has' been a fomenter of strife; a stirrer up of class hatreds, a
breeder of anarchy. Even anarchists like Johann Most place the burden of the crime of
Czolgosz on Hearst's yellow journals. By. their fruits ye shall know them, and no de
fense at this late day will be able to clear this unscrupulous, reckless and mischief-makinÂ°
man from this great and terrible responsibility." -. 0 â¢ , .
The New York Press, as an illustration of what Hearst has done to promote
anarchy, prints this from tho New York Evening Journal of May 22, 1901:
"What is an anarchist? . :',
"According to accepted definitions issued by the higher class of society an an
archist is one who tries to do something useful that has never been done before.
"There is a change coming some day, whether the gentlemen who denounce char
ity as anarchy want the change or not."
Upon that statement no comment is needed. The Press gave none and neither
shall we. It stands as Hearst published it. .
BUSINESS was not very eventful last week, but
the showing was good. The bank clearings
of the country exhibited a gain of 49.3 per cent
over the corresponding week last year, and what was
significant, every large city recorded an increase. In
deed, of the eighty cities and towns reporting weekly
bank clearings, only ten showed a loss as compared
with 1900. If this does not indicate a general expan
sion of business throughout the country nothing
does. The gains among the first-class cities were
large, New York -heading the list with one of 63.9
per cent, Chicago showing 25, Boston 57, St. Louis
49, Pittsburg 46, and so on. The failures, however,
continued to run ahead of those last year in point of
numbers, those fcr the week being 227, against 205,
but none of them were sufficiently large to attract
attention.
The distributive trade, as will be inferred from the
increased clearings, is everywhere good. This con
dition, thcugh general, is more pronounced in the
West and South than along the Atlantic Coast,
though the latter section reports an increased retail
demand. Dry goods are quoted quieter at many
points, but this is offset by a larger distribution of
clothing and boots and shoes.
The settlement of the steel strike, as was expected,
has resulted in a marked increase in business in this
line, and the demand for almost everything is brisk.
The inquiry for steel rails is breaking previous
records, and is so sharp that the amount of old orders
to be carried over for delivery into next year is esti
mated at from 250,000 to 400,000 tons. Some Chicago
mills have orders for general steel products booked as
far ahead as the close of 1902. This abnormal busi
ness is hardening*prices, and a number of descriptions
have advanced during the week.
Cotton goods are still unsettled, owing to the weak
ness in raw cotton, but the mills are evidently not
losing money, for several have advanced the wages of
operatives. Hides rule firm in sympathy with leather,
which is in demand, both for export and domestic
consumption. Wool and woolen goods are in fair de
mand and firm, without especial feature.
The cereal markets are quiet. Wheat shows little
fluctuation either way, as the best estimates indicate
a world's crop slightly in excess of the normal con
sumption, hence operators at the leading markets do
not look for much variation in prices until conditions
change. Provisions have been unsettled at Chicago
and other Western points, and while the tendency in
quotations has been upward of late it is now reported
by private wire that the strength has become some
what fictitious, and that the market is being held up
by the large packers, and whenever they relax their
support it immediately weakens.
Wall street has been quieter. A flurry in copper
shares enlivened the street for several days, but
beyond this there is little excitement Fluctuations in
all classes of securities are narrower than for some
little time back, and there is no change in the money
market sufficient to create any especial activity, one
way or the other.
In our local market conditions remain pretty much
the same. The wearing out of the strike is eas
ing up matters, though the improvement is grad
ual. ' Goods are being moved with greater freedom
and in larger volume, however, and the situation is
much clearer than a month or even a fortnight ago.
Country produce is still selling well at good prices,
and the outlook is for another prosperous winter.
In a few days San Francisco will be called upon to
welcome another distinguished body of men and
women. The men will represent the highest thought
in the Episcopal Church in almost every civilized land
under the sun. It goes without saying that San Fran
cisco will extend to her visitors a welcome as gen
erous and as broad 23 it has given to the thousands
of other distinguished visitors who have honored us
with their presence.
From the frequency with j which Southern news
papers point with pride to' the fact that Roosevelt's
mother was a Georgian, itVould seem that there may
arise a^Roosevelt. party in that section that will make
Democracy look like thirty cents at the next election.
The report that President Roosevelt said he would
not be a candidate in 1964 has now been denied, and
all aspirants who thought of putting up rods to
attract Presidential > lightning will of course , take
notice without further warning.

An international peace conference, which was in
session at Glasgow at the time of the assassination of
President McKinley, closed its proceedings by
adopting a resolution urging the civilized nations to
"put an end to international anarchy and convert the
money now expended in armaments to the uses of
commerce and industry." The curious use of the
word anarchy will be noted. It is going to be so after
a while that a man cannot swear at a dog without
calling him an anarchist.

NOTES OF THE PROGRESS IN THE UPBUILDING
OF THE NAVIES OF THE POWERS OF THE WORLD
They got four months of idleness, during which, to nurse
their discontent; four months of oratory from the sleek and
well fed "walking delegate," who rides in Pullman cars; four
months eating into the little nest egg laid away for a rainy
day; four months of picket duty, trying to keep their fellow
workman from earning an honest living and winning his bread
by honest toll, so that he could go home at night to his wife
and little, ones every inch a ' man and share with them, the
fruits of honest toll; four months living on a pittance doled
out in meager sums by the sleek, fat hands of the officers of
the union, who toil not, neither do they spin; four months of
either prowling, pantherlike, -at night and springing, catlike,
on their brother workman and brutally beating him into in
sensibility for no other crime than that he tried to earn his
bread by honest toll, or else trying to explain that the union
In whose interest these crimes were committed was not re
sponsible for their commission; four months' resistance
to law and authority; four months' business drifting to other,
cities not so thoroughly Â° supplied with the .Vblesslngs" of
unionism; four months* prosperity turned into depression /and
ruin, the fruits of which, if preserved, would have been shared
to the full by evWy man on strike for principleâ fruit blighted
in the bud and withered in the blossom; four months to ac-
The larders of the workmen were filled with the comforts
of life; the little ones were well clothed, well fed, well schooled
and happy. They felt that it was but Just that they share to
a still greater extent in the results of prosperity and de
manded ten hours' pay for nine hours' work. Or, to put it
more plainly, they demanded that their employers give them,
either from- their capital or their earnings, one hour's pay each
day without giving an equivalent in work or anything else.
This demand would have been conceded to the workmen and
they; could have reaped to this extent where they had not
sown. Did they stop there? No. They demanded the privi
lege of running their employers' business and forcing their
brother workmen to join the union and contribute to Its sup
port or else remain Idle and starve.
â¢. . Did they v get their demand? No. What did they get? Let
us see.
The visit of our late lamented President to the city turned
the eyes pf the country toward San Francisco and gave it an
advertisement far more valuable than could have been secured
by tho investment 'Of money or the efforts of any commercial
body.
. Wo find that In May of this year the city was en
joying Industrial prosperity to an extent never before seen in
nil its history; the recult of tho Spanish war upon the city of
San Francisco was beginning to make it apparent that the
city had entered on a period of growth and prosperity that bid
fair to result In a largo increase of population; an increase in
trade and commerce; a new and bright era In Its commercial
life, and its workmen found a market for their labor at re
munerative rates, with steady employment in- sight.
TO the Editor of Tho Call: I desire to review, for tho
careful consideration of tho laboring men of San Fran
cisco, tho labor situation in our city, as it furnishes, to
eny tho least, food for reflection.
cumulate debts to be struggled under for the next four yean;
four months In which to sell or pawn for the bread of Idleness
the things which decorate and beautify tho home; four
months to prove to the employer of labor that the union work
man cares nothing for Justice and equity, and to warn him to
withdraw his capital and retire to a quiet life, where the
unions cease from troubling and the weary find some rest;
four months to read tho "yellow" Journal and learn that the
man who has money to create work and pay for It on payday
is the mortal enemy of the union; four months to test tha
great benefits of membership In a union.
What of the next four months? Your ranks will be broken;
the gentlemen of leisure who fatten best when strife Is hottest
and.whose vocation Is gone when labor Is contented and happy
will retire to the obscurity from whence they came: they will
not be much in evidence around your homes replenishing your
depleted cupboards or administering to your pressing needs,
and If they preach any gospel at all it will bo "every man for
himself." Your places will be filled by the man you have been
taught to call "scab," which Is a modern Greek word which
means "an American citizen who has not sworn away his
liberty to work for an honest living." and you will have plenty
of time to answer the question: "Does unionism pay when it
goes out of |ts legitimate field of work, which is the moral and
Intellectual betterment of its members? When it 1b not con
tent to treat with employers on the question of wages and
hours alone, but demands the right to arbitrarily run Its em
ployer's business, and, failing to do this, malms and wounds
his fellow laborer because he exercises his right asan Ameri
can citizen In selling his labor in the open marketr You win
have time to figure as to whether the dues you have paid to
the lodge and the four months of enforced idleness, with its
consequent results, have been a good Investment, and you will
be able to answer intelligently: Does it pay to belong to a
union? If not. why not? ,^^
Also which Is the greatest tyrant, labor or capital? Which
has caused the most tears to flow, the labor leader who or
dered the strike or the employer who refused to yield to his
demands? Also which of the two classes mentioned below has^
contributed the most to the prosperity of the city and directly
to the pockets of the workmen? Namely, the Scotts, tha
Hendys the Gibbses, the Spreckels. the Rlsdons and tha
Strausses as employers of labor or the labor leaders, namely
the Vuruseths, the Rosenbergs and the Caseys? Furthermore,
it might be a liberal education if the striker would devote the
next four months in attempting to balance the following ac
count, which will serve as a sample for all:
Machinists' Union of San Francisco
To John Doe, Striker. Dr.
To four months' dues, at $150.per month WOO

DENOUNCES INFLAMMATORY WORDS OF FATHER YORKE
"What can we do about it? We o'ught to do something if we can. Even criti
cism loses its power when it overreaches Itself to such an extent, and when- the
people know that Washington and Lincoln and the noblest men of tho world are
defamed, tho very object of the criticism is destroyed.
"There aro only two things we can do. We cannot apply law to them, because
in that it would be worse than to let them have their way; but decent people in
New York can stop buying the paper. It coats a cent; some of tho more decent
ones cost two or three. If there is any man in my congregation who decides to
buy the New York Journal on account of its costing less than the others, or who
can't afford another, if ho comes to me I will pay the difference and give him
a decent paper."

Had McKlnley been tho creature portrayed, and Ignorance fed on Incendiary
counsel might â¢ easily have so imagined, a sigh of relief would have been tho
acknowledgment of thÂ« news of hla murder. Iiut he was a man, pure, upright
and strong, and tho country wept. When tho yellow Journalist penned fair words
of condolence ho stamped lilmHolf as a liar and a hypocrite; a yellow Journalist.
The quotations answer all the questions* Hearst h papers have Injured a
"good institution": thoy have injured the Government. They have sought to
make it appear an organized crime, an outrage, a form of oppression and a
meunÂ» of robbery.
They have assailed tho state, whether this be taken to mean so
ciety at largo or tho common wealth of California. At present the San
Francisco Examiner Is bending its malign energies to the production of
industrial ruin, to the embittering of class against class, to the encour
agement of a lawless rabble and to the overthrow of municipal au
thority.
They havo assailed the church, because they have sought to lower the
moral tone; becauso they have painted vice in alluring colors; poisoned the
mlndu and Inflamed tho pnHfllnns of tho young; because the success they have
MTincil to achieve has been due, not to honest effort, but to fraud. Thoy havo
stolon the robe of charity to hldo their nlns. Thoy havo printed fictitious In

The celebration of tho Independence of
Mexico, which was held by the Hidalgo
Club last_night Jn^Odd^Fellows'^Hall,
proved'one of the most Euccessfuranni
versary festivals ever conducted In this
city. The hall, which was brilliantly dec
orated with hundreds of multi-colored ln
candeecent lights and with long streamers
of intertwined blossoms and evergreens
suspended from the center of the celling,
was taxed to Its greatest capacity. Every
seat was occupied and hundreds stood in
the aisles and along tho walls, while hun
dreds more were turned away.
Tne celebration was to have been held
on Septemberr 16, but was postponed until
last night in deference to the nation's
Borrow over the death of its beloved Pres
ident. The programme consisted almost
entirely of patriotic selections. A. Forbes
delivered an oration in Spanish, in which
he naid a glowing tribute to the achieve
ments of the Mexican republic. He was
followed by II. V. Morehouse, who spoko
in Kncllsh.
The electrical display, which was re
served until the end of the programme,
proved one of the interesting features of
the evening. The chorus, which waa com
posed of young ladles robed in white, pre
sented a beautiful spectacle and acquitted
itself in a commendable manner. The cel
euratlon was concluded with a grand ball.
Ramon Merel acted as president of the
evening". Henry Alvarez as vJco president,
V. D. Medina as treasurer, Gulllermo
Kotta as secretary and A. Armendarls as
nsslstant secretary.
HTDAXGO CLUB OBSERVES
NATAL DAY OF MEXICO
L>adarro was employed nn bookkeeper
in the hospital for two years and wan
implicitly trusted by the manujjerB. One
year ago ho wui mado uhhIhiuiu tmpcrtn
tendont in recognition of IiIh vcuuable
services. Ho waa under bondH in the turn
of liooo. K is believed that his friends
will come to his rescue as soon as tho
shortage is actually known. Tho man
agement says that i,ni!urrÂ« will not be
placed under arrcsi, in the expectation
that the deficit will ho mado wood, in
which event there will bo no prosecution.
L,adarra is a married innn about 30
years of bko and reside* at 433 Fuurth
avenue. Ho was not known to hnvo nny
bad habits and his friends are at a loss
to know what prompted him to approprl
ato the funds of tho hospital. A rumor
was current that L.odarro hitd left the
city, but >t could not be verified.
It is not exactly known how Ladarre
diverted the funds of the hospital to his
own use. It is thought that he doctored
thÂ« accounts in the ledger and that fic
titious memoranda were delivered by
him to the cashier In order that the two
accounts should balance. The deposits in
the bank are made dally and the pecula
tions have been KolriK on dally for some
time. It is not thought that they amount
individually to more than a few dollars,
but the aggregate would make a large
sum. Â«'.- - .*">Â¦ '.Â¦
An examination of the books was com
menced on Friday and a cursory Inspec
tion showed that Ladarre was short some
$1500 in his ledger accounts. As. the ac
counts were in such a tang-led condition
it was deemed advisable to press an
expert Into service in order to fix the
amount of the shortage definitely.
Henri P. Ladarre, assistant superin
tendent of the French Hospital, Is short
In his accounts and an expert . has been
engaged to go over his books to ascer
tain the exact amount of the suppesed
defalcation. Superintendent Mlqueu made
the discovery last Thursday that all was
not right with his subordinate's books
and he immediately reported the matter
to the board of managers.

SAN FRANCISCO.
The past week's series of ball games at
Recreation grounds and at Oakland was
a repetition of the same old storyâ tho;
Los Angeles team arriving here with its
average fattened by many victories on the
home grounds and within striking dis
tance of the lead, only to have its fond
est hopes shattered by the overwhelming
defeat administered by the San Francisco
champions. The Redlegs were completely
outclassed yesterday both at Oakland and
on the local grounds, and finished the
series with but a single victory to their
credit. They brought a strong team and
fought hard, but luck seemed against
them. If they do not take a majority of
the games from the Oakland cripples next
week the^oveted pennant will go to the
Germans. \
1 Pabst was the first man to come home.
In the second inning lie hit out. a double,
took third on a wild pitch and came in on
Krug's hot drive to Reitz, which was
fielded too slowly. Schwartz scored an
other run in the fourth by means of two
errors by Hall. Whalen and Wilson mads
the rounds in the fifth by means of a pair
of hits, a passed ball and an error by
Householder. In the sixth and seventn
the German side of the score went two
higher, aided by the clean hitting of
Schwartz, Shay, Whalen, Nordyke and
Wilson, giving the locals six runs and the
game.
Reitz opened the sixth round for Los
Angeles with a hard drive to Reilly, whicli
Josh overthrew, putting "Oriole" on sec
ond. He soon scored on Atherton's two
bagger, the latter following on a couple
of infield outs. In the seventh and -eighth
a home run by Atherton and hits by Spies
and AUrock netted two more runs. The
game went to the home team by a score
of six to four. V
Whalen and Altrock. the southpaw, did
the slab work. Both were hit hard. vThe
Germans' hits, however, were more time
ly and they were clearly entitled. to the
victory. "Chimmie der Whale" sprung a
surprise on the crowd by rapping out two
safe onesâ a double and a single. For
the "Looloos" big Atherton did the heavi
est hitting, getting a home run over tho
center field fence and two clean two-bag
gers. Hall, the new Angel shortstop, had
only two chances. He missed them both,
letting In a run. Hemphill was put in to
bat in place of Altrock in the ninth, but
could do nothing with "Chimmie.'
Notwithstanding the wet weather the
grounds were packed and the vast throng
cheered wildly every time a GermarMnade
a good play. Oakland and Los Angeles
will play here next .week, while the
Wasps will journey to the. Capital City
to ! argue with . the Senators.- Following

against him. In the run up the field he
showed his previous hard work had had
no bad- effect. He led the fast black dog
to the hare and beat him in the work.
This course, too, was a long one, and the
talent, figuring that the winners was no
match for the lapid Aeolus, his next op
ponent, laid 4 to 1 against his chances.
Again the youngster showed his game
ness, and Aeolus retired.
"When the sensational runner was
slipped for the final he had Royal Archer
for an opponent. Archer had just beaten
Tralee Boy, a 1 to 4 favorite, and with his
total of 96 seconds against Martin's 185,

Place Second Win of a Valu

Credit.
The bicycle riders sporting the colors
of the Golden Gate Athletic Club Wheel
men of San Jose placed the second win
to their credit yesterday of the Baker &
Hamilton cup, the most beautiful tropiy
ever raced for on this coast by wheel
men. >>;^:" â¢ .rÂ»'\ Â¦ .:â¢â¢'
The cup was offered for competition in
1898 and was won by the Acme Club of
Oakland. In 1807 the Bay City Wheel
men won It. In the two succeeding years
it was won by the Olympic Club Wheel
men, while last year the Garden City
Wheelmen placed the first victory to
their credit. It must be won three times
to become the property of a club.
The race is held annually over a twenty
mile course commencing at Fitchburg.
four miles from San Leandro. Two cir
cuits of the famous /"triangle" course,
which commences at/ San Leandro, com
plete the twenty miles. Kach club enters
nve riders. They are started In groups
made up of one rider irom each cIud.
These groups are started five minutes
apart.
A. McDonald of {5an Jose made the
fastest time yesterday, riding the twenty
mhes in fifty minutes and fifteen seconds.
Burton Downing, a club mate, took four
iifths of one second longer. Edwin a\
Russ Is credited with the fastest time In
the race, having covered the distance last
ye%r In forty-nine minutes thirty-seven
and three-fifths seconds.
The total time required by all the
Garden City team yesterday to cover the
course was three minutes fourteen and
two-fifths seconds less than that required
by the Bay City Wheelmen. This Is the
basis on which the race is decided. The
time made by each rider is shown In the
appended table: ' .
The officers of the Associated- Cyclists
have a delicate question of racing ethics
to decide before the cup will be placed in
possession of the team which finished
first yesterday. Since the last race the
club has changed its name from the
Garden City Wheelmen to the Garden
City Athletic Club Wheelmen, having
consolidated -with an athletic club. Its
officers remain the Same, and none of the
men on its racing: team have been drawn
from the ranks of the athletic club. Its
team was not strengthened in the trans
action. The cup was withheld pending Uia
decision of the board of officers.

A description of. some of the San Ber
nardino County . gold mines is given by
the Times-Index. The Gold Mountain
mine, which Is in the Holcomb .Valley
mining district, has a history .that, goes
back about thirty years, when a 40-stamp
mill was - operated. . One of the original
owners was "Lucky"" Baldwin. â¢ Captain
de la Mar acquired the mine about two
years ago. A 40-stamp mill has been' built
farther up the mountain. The Rose mine
is much more extensive than the Gold
Mountain mine. The high grade ore. is
shipped to the Pueblo smelter. The low
grade, ores are handled by the cyanide
process. . ' vU' '

On. October 14, 1899, Robert Woodburn deeded
to Messrs .Hall 4rtd Duvergey the Globe, group
of mines near Canon Creek for ; the sum of $25 -
000. Fourteen days. â¢ later he' brought suit In
the. Superior Court of the county to rescind the
contract, alleging In his complaint that he had
been Induced by fraud to part with his prop
erty for Â¦ a sum below its actual I value. â¢ The
answer of the defendants denied all the allega
tions'of the complaint. After â¢ the; usual pre
llmliiary' sparring; the case was set for trial
on. June .4, 11900. Owing to ;. the 111 health of
Judge Jones, Judge Edward" Sweeny presided.
The pleadings were not settled, and after argu
ment by counsel the case tvas continued. Sick
ness of counsel and other,' complications inter
vened so that the . case - dragged along until
last ' Monday, when : the i. court, Judge Amot
presiding," began i the ; trial. â¢_;Â¦ Â¦ - t ','. .:
A suit Is before theSuperlor Court;in
Trinity County involving the Globe mines
The Trinity Journal gives the facts of
the case as follows: . ; .}'â -â¢
Suit Over Klines.
.The Pandsburg Miner reports that the
old Panamint 'mines, In which large sums
were sunk by Senator Jones and Senator
Stewart, will be reopened after being shut
down "for Â¦ twenty-five years. The mines
nre on Peak, at an altitude of
10,000 feet; The property, was sold for de
linquent taxes amounting to a few thou
sands of dollars. The former owners lost
something like three-quarters of a million
dollars' operating this property, but the
more economical processes that have
since come Into vogue hold out fair pros
pects'of a margin of profit above the cost
of mineral production.
The expense attached to mining borax
in Southern California, so says the Los
Angeles Herald, Is very small compara
tively. Transportation â¢ to the railroads
constitutes the chief element of cost.
Cheap transportation would remove the
temptation that now results In great
adulterations . of borax, because under' fa
vorable conditions for getting the product
to market the price could be made so low
that" adulteration would be unprofitable.
The output of: borax_ in this State last
year is estimated by the State Mineralo
gist at $1,013,251. .

new field, which la between forty and fifty
miles from the present center of. the ac
tivity of copper mining in Shasta County.
The locality picked out for exploration Is
on the Pit River, southward from the
Kosk Creek mines. The preliminary re
port Is that there are outcropplngs which
have lent hope to the prospectors. The
local papers of Shasta County express the
opinion that the new field, promises . well.

The grand march of the participants
The Carnival of Ancient and Modern
Art which opens at Native Sons' Hall this
evening promises to be one of the most
beautiful spectacular entertainments ever
seen In Ban Francisco. The affair will be
In charge of the Woman's Educational and
Industrial Union, of which Mme. Louise
Sorbier Is president. All the members of
that body, together with hundreds of so
ciety belles and matrons, have interested
themselves in the promotion of the enter
tenment, and the Indications' are that
it will prove a brilliant success in every
particular. â¢ v / ,
The primary purpose of the affair is-to
raise funds for the erection of a perma
nent home for the Union. If the present
indications are to be relied upon, the sum
now in the Union's treasury will doubt
less be largely increased. The popular
interest taken in the event is intense and
indicates the estimation in which the no
ble purposes of the Union are held. The
aims of the organization are to instruct
unskilled women in branches which will
make it possible for them to earn a liv
ing. Classes in music and general stud
ies are maintained, I and graduates from
the classes are provided with lucrative
positions. It is the only organization of
its kind in the city, and its usefulness is
generally recognized.

Lillie went to where he had burled the
balance of the money that was, left after
paying his bills yesterday and turned
something more than $400 into the hands
of Chief of Police Hodgklns.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, 'Sept. 29.
The remarkable story of being robbed
of $700 on the streets of Oakland, told by
W. V. Lillle to the police last night, was
without the slightest foundation. It was
told by Lillle in .order to cover his
financial difficulties. .Lillle' had drawn
about $550 during the afternoon, had paid
$109 to his men and settled material
claims amounting, to $22 50, leaving some
thing over $400 in his .possession, Instead
of $700, as he claimed.

New Field Wins Notice.
Much attention is being paid to the new
field near Santa Maria. In Santa Barbara
County. There appears to be a largo
amount of natural gag there. An aban
doned well la reported to have filled With
oil. This well was broken off some time
ago by an earthquake. The Graclosa.
Company, In which Henry J. Crocker Is
Interested, la sinking a well near the wella
of the Western Union Campany. This
company has a tract of 7500 acres.
The contract for delivering oil at Kah
ulul and other points In the Hawaiian Ia
lands to L. M. Thurston for the use of
sugar companies calls for about 123.00*
barrels per annum. There was only one
bidder, the Union Oil- Company. Plans
have been prepared for a tank steamer to.
be used by the Union Company in this
trade. The price is ?1 40. a barrel, deliv
ered at the Islands. . â¢ â¢Â¦Â».
The Pacific Coast Oil Company will
have a minimum capacity for refining 2000
barrels a day at its new plant at Point
Richmond. Contra Costa County. The she
that has been purchased for the plant Is
110 acres. The removal from Alameda was
due to the lack of sufficient room and
deep water to accommodate the larger oil
steamers that will soon be running. The
entire plant will be removed from Ala
meda to. Point"" Richmond as soon as pos
sible. The works in Alameda have been
in existence upward of twenty years* .. - .
Approaching a Climax.
The Redding Searchlight has the fol
lowing to say concerning the quest for oil
in Shasta County: .
Affairs, are approaching a climax with the
oil Industry in Shasta County. The Shaft*
Consolidated Company, the local corporation
that was much the strongest, has reached tKa
end of Its financial rope. In fact, the com
pany has used up all of its money and is al^
ready slightly In debt, but the directors of the
concern stand ready to meet any Indebtedness.
For about two weeks the whole string of
tools has laid at the bottom of the welt and
continuous fishing has so far been unsuccess
ful. The directors held a meeting Tuesday
evening and IV was decided to continue th â¢;
fishing until Saturday.
The result of the endeavors of the next ten
days will determine the course of the company.
If the tools are not recovered work will be
suspended, probably for good. If, they j arÂ«Â»
taken out the well will be closed for some time,
but in all probability drilling will be later
resumed.
The proposed method of "raising the wind"
for further drilling shows the faith 6t the in
terested parties In the presence of oil at a
greater depth. The directors and others pro
pose to go down in their Individual pockets
to the tune of $100 each.
It Is to be regretted that the funds gare out
at this time. The presence or absence of oil
has not yet been determined. At the Shasta
Consolidated well the formation throujrb Â¦
which the drill passed was favorable through'
but. The most sanguine had not anticipated
the striking of oil short of a depth of U 1 "
feet. The well Is now between 900 and ld(W
feet deep. It is to be hoped a greater depth
will be attained.
The Standard seems to bÂ« having; ioim trou
ble in filling its fifteen tanks, already com
pleted In the Kern River field, with " Â«nt
oil. Seven of the tanks have not as yet nad *
drop of the product of the local wells turned
Into them anil the ot)iÂ«r eight are not filled to
overflowing. Yet the syndicate seems to havo
no apprehension about procuring all tne oil
needed as is evidenced by the plans already,
wet forth to construct an additional fifteen
35,000-barrel tanka. The workmen who wÂ«rÂ«
employed In putting the root on the tanks nave
been laid off for thirty days owing to the
scarcity of lumber. The carpenters are now
planning to build a model office bulldln* for
the local managers near the company s load
ing racks.

Trains may be running Into the Sunset
district this week. Additional extensions ..
of lines in /he oil region may be made
by the Southern Pacific Company. The
oil men say that therewfll.be a revival Of
activity in new work In Sunset now that
there are facilities In sight for transpor
tation. At present there Is little drilllnc
going On there. Several companies" are
drilling in the McKittrick district. The
shipments from the latter field average
about eighty barrels a day.. Most ofthÂ«
wells are capped while the owrlers arÂ«
waiting for more satisfactory prices."

siderable activity in the Coalinga field.
Work has begun on the Main State Com

cess of the Standard Oil Company in Â¦ fill

I'.akersilfld Uallfornian says: . :
The class hatred which prevails in countries
where hereditary classes rule has no place in
this free land. As President McKinley said
In his address to the high school here:
"There In no position In thl* country so high
but that the boy from the forge, the factory
cr the farm may aspire to and achieve It."
In Europe society Is stratified like the rocks,
where the upper stratum hold* the lower down
forever. . but with us society Is stratified like
the waters of the ocean, where each drop is
free to move and the lowest may rise and
clitter on the crest of the highest wave.
Friends, class hatred can rear no factories;
it can only close or festr v those already
reared. It can fill no granaries, but It can
hurl a firebrand Into those that Industry and
enterprise have already filled. The Interests
of capital and Ichor are rot a seesaw In which
one is only ud when the other is down, but
their Interests are Inseparable and identical.
The vast majority of capitalists are only
successful workers and their capital is accu
mulated savin**.* If that employer will draw
off his glove you will see the broken nail, the
stiffened finger, the stumo left by the buzz
uw or the calloused palm, the badge of honest
toll. Tho great publishers started as typeset
ters, the great Studebakers sandpapered wagon
bodies and the great merchants began as er
rand boys. That railroad oresldent "hit the
roa<^" a* a brakeman.
Any attempt to stir up class hatred is un-
American and vicious. To hear some agitators
talk, one would think that the American work
ingman was sinking year by year Into a more
hopeless servitude and slavery, that every
man's hand Is against them outside their own
ranks, and that there is a Klprrritic conspiracy
to oppress and rob them. While It is true that
labor does not yet receive Its full share of the
benefits of the great era of Invention and
wealth In which we are. living, still -the position
of worklngmen was never oo erood as It Is to
day. During the last century the average In
come In the United Btaten increased fivefold
but that of the workingman six and a half
times, and the report of the Senate committee
shows that the average dally wage has two
and a half times the purchasint power It had
in 1540.
Conditions Never Better.
I tell you when men confederate together to
prevent others by force from doing the work
they refuse to do they are fighting not for but
against the most sacred rlg-hts of man. There
Is no difference between them and the most
tyrannous monopolist who ever bankrupted his
rivals; there is no difference. If they resort to
violence, between them and the anarchist who
sets all government and all law at defiance.
Here Is a man whose wife is sick and his
children are home crying for bread; his rent
is due and he must pay it or be turned into
the street; the tenderest and holiest ties of
life call upon him to go to the shop and earn
a little to keep the wolf from the door and
his dear onea from the potter's field: and be
cause he tries to eell his labor, his cr.'y asset,
for bread he is set upon and beaten into a
Jelly.
We have swept away slavery at a great cost
because it permitted a man to say to his fel
lows: "You shall work on my terms whether
you choose or not." But worse than slavery
Is that other despotism which says "If you
work when I do not want you to do so. I will
malm your horses, I will beat you, I will kill
you."
To-night I charge those who directly or In
directly conspire to prevent others by force
from doing the work they themselves refuse to
do as being anarchists and enemies of society.
My sympathies are naturally with the toller.
I have earned by labor (25 a month and > lived
on it. There is scarcely a tool of manual la
bor that I do not know how to use. We are all
worklngmen here to-night. People say that
worklngmen do not go to church. The trouble
is, as Bishop McCabe cays, they do not know
us Methodists when we get our Sunday clothes
on; they think we are all bankers and mil
lionaires. It Is religion and not wealth that
makes us look eo prosperous. And as for a
strike under one aspect It Is a perfectly proper
and lawful thing. No one can question the
right of one man or of 100;) men to quit work
If unjustly treated. Indeed, there Is something
sublime and heroic when men choose to quit
work and suffer hunger and privation in order
that manifest wrongs done to some of their
number may be righted. If strikes were always
lawfully conducted no one need dread them
but the oppressors of the poor. But frequently
strikes inspired by visionary and ambitious
leaders who array class against class destroy
the peace and subvert the social order of com
munities, ... â¢âÂ».;.. Â¦ i '

Class Against Class.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Sept 29.
Rev. E. R. Dille of the First Methodist
Church preached this evening upon "The
Crime of Arraying Class Against Class."
His sermon had direct application to the
conditions that exist in San Francisco to
day and was a very powerful exposition
of the effect of striKes. Dr. Dille has
always been in deep sympathy with the
worklngmanâ was a workingman and a
soldier himselfâ and his utterances upon
Industrial topics have always been re
garded as most liberal. His sermon this
evening has special significance in view
of these conditions. He took the ground
that strikes were Justifiable, but violence
was not; that strikers never -built up
anything, but onfy destroyed. Dr. DillÂ«
cnarged that those who prevented others
from doing work they would not do
themselves were anarchists." During his
wrmun Dr. Dille said:
On Saturday afternoon next the

childhood of San Francisco with a per

Pollettini repeats her very good reading
of last year of the harlequin's part.
The next production of the Joseph Ha

house will be "The Merchant of Venice,"
Â¦with Mr. Haworth, of course, as Shylock.
The character is one of the strongest In
the actor's large repertoire and is a con

"showman, phrenologist, hypnotist and
palmist." Hans F. Roberts and Charles

clever blackface work; a novelty musical
act by Carl McDonald and Parshley, and
the Zeb and Zarrow trio in sensational

joct, not to Kpoak of some new songs.

Mr. \V. himself is a delight as usual,
with his customary acreage of waistcoat.
.Â«mile and chrysanthemum, and the
? 'hesterfield of interlocutors never looked
l>etter in epite of his not very distant se
vere illness. The minstrels this year are
Karbed gorgeously In satin of the reddest
and shrined In a handsome Venetian gar
den, and number among themselves some
new voices of the best. Perhaps the
finestâ always after that melodious organ
of Billy Van'sâ is that of a youngster of
eighteen, one Georgie Jones, who sings a
manly eong in a fine, deep baritone that
tvlns the house at once. Ills song was
new and taking, and called "Th* Game
of Eyes."
In epUe of "Mistah Johnson's" aspiring
fiancee's dictum as to "end men's jokes,"
and her laudaole decision to spend "Mis
tah Johnson's" solitary sous only "when
Shakespeare comes to town," a full house
laughed for all it was worth In old-time
fashion with West's minstrels last night
at the California Theater.

Once Destroy the Dandruff Germ, and
Hair Grows Luxuriantly. .
Any one can have nice hair If he or she
has not dandruff, which causes brittle,
dry hair, falling hair and baldness. ;To -
cure dandruff It Is necessary to kill* *.he
germ that causes It and that Is just what
Newbro'a Herpiclde does. Cornelius
Grew. Colfax, Wash., says:
"One bottle of Herpiclde completely
cured me of dandruff, which was very
thick, and It has stopped my hair from
falling out." It makes hair soft and glos-
sy as silk; delightful odor and refreshing
hair dressing. It will positively make hair
grow abundantly, and kills the dandruff
germ. -

V UPON ETEENAL JUSTICE
Cays It Is the Greatest . Attributs;
Known to Hen and That Its
Vindication Is Certain..
The Rev. Philip Coombe preached at the
Richmond Congregational. Church last
evening on the subject, "The Vindication
of Eternal Justice." He said in substance:
The Question which we have asked ourselves
&g-aln and again is why did God allow such a
noble man as William McKlnley to be mur
dered eo cruelly and treacherously? We must
believe that be could have prevented the trai
tor from carrying out his purpose, that he
could have Inspired pood men .to foresee the
action of the free criminal and to forefend his
crime. Men in our city were influenced to
prophesy the wicked deed. Why were not men
in Buffalo led to suspect the covered hand and
to keep back the hidden bullets. The only
answer to this question that satisfies my mind
Is that he allowed the criminal to carry out
his purpose against McKlnley for the same rea
son that he permitted Judas to band over Jesus
to his crudners. namely, that men might be
filled with a demand for Justice, inspired to
manifest justice and that eternal justice might
bÂ« vindicated.
I need not tell yon that jus tire Is none too
prevalent In the world to-day, that it is often
times travestied in our courts and buried be
neatb legal technicalities ; that it ia ignored in
theology, eet aside in politics and sometimes
forgotten by the press. But it is comforting In
our present sorrow to remember numerous his
torical Illustration* in which Justice has been
exalted In human thought through (tome great
tragedy like thst which is universally lamented
Â» ana regretted to-<Jsy.
Justice Is thÂ« greatest attribute known to
men. It U th* foundation upon which rests
Ood'a throne in the universe. The court of
heaven Is the court of juitlee, the attribute
<rtth which tha sinner has to deal in seeking
salvation-
If the tarrtfirt Â«f eur beleved and honored
ettfeen has filled us with a demand for Justice
â¢ nd * dectre to manifest It; If the sentence ef
Ms murderer Is Â«. vmtirat inn af eternal justice,
let us thank Ood, even though we do so with

Mrs. Bush, the landlady of the house,"
says that she saw Growney Saturday af
ternoon. He was then in his usual jovial
epirits. The only complaint he had ever
made was that his heart was troubling
him. His son William also saw him Sat
urday morning and he seemed to be all
Â« right then.
â¢Growney was the complaining witness
In a case last week against Kittle Ma
loney, charged with grand larceny. He
iccused her of stealing $140 from him
while he was In a room in a lodginghouse
at Eighth and Folsonv- streets Tuesday
evening. He alleged that the woman and
her brother, who has not yet been ar
rested, came Into the room, blew out the
fas and took the money from him. The
woman was arrested, and the case I is
pending in Judge Cabaniss' court.
Â¦ Growney came into prominence during
thÂ« sand-lot agitation more than twenty
years ago, and was one of Denis Kear
ney's lieutenants. He was arrested along
"with Kearney and kept in Jail for six or
seven weeks at that time.
The old man had been suffering for
several years from heart disease and it
Is supposed that death resulted from that
cause. A tumbler was found on a ta
ble -at his bedside, however, with some
liquid In It that smelled strongly of pep
permint. This liquid will be analyzed to
seÂ« if It contained poison. /It was said
that Growney was very fond of pepper
mint, and some peppermint lozenges -were
found in his room by the Deputy Coroner.
Dr.' Bacigalupl will make an autopsy, and
if it is found that death was' not aue to
natural causes the stomach will â¢ be sent
to ChÂ«ni6t Green to be analyzed. â¢?.
Â¦Â¦^Theodore Growney, an engineer 72 years
of age, was found dead in bed In his room
at 14S Eleventh street yesterday morning
shortly after 11 o'clock. The Mor%ue offi
cials were notified and Deputy Coroner
Brown took charge of the body.
Politicians refer to a recent interview in
which Wells indorsed the
Phelan administration. This utterance
ascribed to Wells is the topic of comment:
"And no one except he be wilfully blind
will deny that the charter has given us
a government of which every citizen
should feel proud."
If tWs Is so every assault on the Phelan
administration Is out of place and the
plank in the Republican platform assail
â¢lng the Board of Public Works is libel.
\ The question Is asked: "How could Re
publican- orators arraign the Phelan ad
ministration in the face of this utterance
of the Republican nominee for Mayor?" *
It may not be too late for revision of
the platform to harmonize with the senti
ments of Auditor Wells. It is eaid that a
new plank will be added to the platform
to-night In the shape of a resolution in
dorsing the administration of Governor
Gage. The resolutions submitted by the
committee and adopted by the convention
last Thursday night did not even hint of
the existence of a Governor, or acknowl
edge that any such thing was known to
politics and a State administration.
Whatever may be the gossip touching
the relations of The Call and Governor
Gage, it cannot be said that this journal
has given him the far away, cold over
look. He is not the brightest or sunniest
chief executive the State has ever had
but he is the only one we have now, and
as he was nominated by a Republican
State convention and elected by Republi
cans, he is entitled to â¢ the courtesy of
mention by the Republican local conven
tion. Doubtless Dr Lawlor has friends
among the delegates, and they might con
gratulate the executive on the removal of
Dr. Osborne from the Homt of the Feeble
Minded to give Lawlor an inning.
There were no indications last night
that Burns and Herrin had changed the
programme for Wells' nomination. Be
fore a ballot is taken Mr. Wells will be
called to the platform to pledge himself
to support the nominees, and declare his
allegiance to the principles of the party.
It is understood that he will be courteous
ly requested to state the time and place
of his meeting with Colonel Burns and
W. F. Herrin, and tell the delegates what
took place.' It goes without saying that
the request will be courteously presented,
for Chairman Rlordan would not permit
the venerable aspirant for the honors of
Mayor to be rudely addressed. Many of
the delegates hold, however, that in all
fairness, they are entitled to know all
about the interview, if the topic discussed
related to the aspirant's nomination for
Mayor by the Republican convention.
In the Republican camp last night there
were many remarks of this nature: "If
the Democrats nominate Harry Creswell
or Franklin K- Lane. Wells will be de
feated."
There is an apprehension that the Au
ditor has not the strength, the stamina
nor vigor that conditions require. All the
citizens are saying that the Republicans
ought to put up a strong man for Mayor.
Politicians who claim to be in posses
sion of inside points make this forecast
of the ticket:
Mayor, Aea R. WellÂ«; Auditor, Harry Baehr;
Treneurer, W, Z. Tiffany: County Clerk, Bert
Wahoney; Tax Collector, Ben Salomon; Public
Administrator, John Faraham; District Attor*
ney, A. O, Fiek; City and County Attorney,
K. w, Uejcher; Sheriff, John I^ackmann; CorÂ»
oner, Pr ( keffler,
Jt seems to be settled that Charles A,
Low will be one of the Police Judges,
Should the manipulators change their
minds tQ'day concerning the advisability
of nominating Mr, Wells for Ma/or, a, ro.
vlPlon of the programme would follow, Jt
wos rumored late last night that the Â«n.
timi of tha, eonferenea at tha Palace
Hotel fn the Indorsement of Wells was
not final,
The BemeeraJlo local ponvenlion will
meet at Qdfl KallflWi' Hall thin evening,
Republicans of (tie rank and file are not
enthusiastic over the news j that Asa â¢ R.
Wells is slated as the candidate (or Mayor
on the party ticket.. There was a good
deal of talk last night to the effect that
the school teachers would turn out and
vigorously oppose his election.
