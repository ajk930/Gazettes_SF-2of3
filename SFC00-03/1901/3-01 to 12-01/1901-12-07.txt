PORTLAND. Ore., Dec. 6.â Eastbound
passenger train No. 2 on the Oregon Rail
â way and Navigation line, â¢which left this
city at 9 o'clock this evening, was wrecked
twelve miles west of The Dalles this aft
ernoon. The engine turned completely
over and the mall car left the track, but
turned only partially over. The composite
sleeper and diner were derailed, but re
mained upright. The other cars, including
a private car containing -Colonel R. C.
dowry, general superintendent of the
_"Western Union Telegraph Company, and
l party, remained on the track-
Engineer Maurice Cavanaugh was bad
ly scalded and internally injured- He
died in the hospital here to-night. Fire
man Frank Chase was seriously injured.
None of the passengers were hurt.
The disaster was undoubtedly the work
of train wreckers, as an examination
showed that a seven-eighths-inch square
nut had been placed on the outside rail of
a three-degree curve. Another nut was
. found on an outside rail about 100 feet
ahead of the first one. The company has
offered $1000 reward for the arrest and
conviction of the criminal.
Four tramps are under arrest in The
Dalles on suspicion of having been con
cerned in the wrecking of the train. A
negro who is detained in The Dalles on
suspicion of having a knowledge of the
crime said that he heard the tramps, who
were put off a train to-day, make threats
against the railroad company.
Engineer Cavanaugh is survived by a
widow and four children.
COURT-MARTIAL VERDICT

Jfavy Department Announces That
the Marine Officer's Conduct
Was Not Scandalous.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â It was an
nounced at the Navy Department that
the court-martial which tried Colonel
Robert L. Meade of the marine corps at
the Brooklyn Navy Yard on charges of
drunkenness on duty, and "scandalous
conduct tending to the destruction of
good morals" has acquitted that officer,
and he has been restored to duty at the
Brooklyn Navy Yard pending the formal
review of the proceedings of the court
by Judge Advocate General Lemly and
Secretary Long's approval of the find
ings.
It is stated that the court makes no
mention whatever in its finding of the
connection of either Colonel Denny or
Major Lauchheimer with the case. It
was at the instance of these two officers
that the court of inquiry which preceded
the court-martial was ordered. It is the
opinion of naval officials that this case,
so far as Colonel Meade is concerned, is
closed and that the formal proceedings
yet remaining will not change the ver
dict cf the court-
PEAISES THE PKESIDENT.
Spectator Declares Boosevelt Has the
Moral Vigor of Cromwell.
LONDON, Dec. 6. â An article on Presi
dent Roosevelt will occupy considerable
space in to-morrow's issue of the Spec
tator. His message to Congress is highly
commended.
"Here, at any rate," says the Spectator,
"is a man who knows what he means
and who means that the world shall
know, it also."
Briefly, the Spectator will approve of
President Roosevelt's attitude both in re
gard to the trusts and the foreign policy,
but the paper will admit that European
powers will never accept Monroeism in
theory and only in practice as long as
the American navy is strong enough to
support it. The Spectator is especially
glad that President Roosevelt is inclined
to face the possibility â¢ of the need to
amend the constitution, which American
statesmen always regard as too sacred
to be touched.
The Spectator will also contain a highly
eulogistic article on President Roosevelt's
essay, "The Citizen and the Public Man,"
and will say that in this essay one sees
a man with the inflexible moral vigor of
Cromwell.
"We are convinced that President
Roosevelt is going to play a great part
and a good part if he continues his work
In the spirit which inspires this remark
able sermon. He will prove the most
sweetening Influence in the whole lump
of civil life in America that has been
shown for many years."

CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMEN ARE ACTIVE
IN SHAPING NEEDED LEGISLATION
Anarchists Will
Get Short
Shrift
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â
Reports of the anarchists' meet
ing in Chicago last night, at
which Abraham Isaak is said to
have praised Czolgosz, and the name of
the assassin was cheered, have been read
by public men to-day in disgust.
Senators and Representatives are par
ticularly incensed, and some are urging
the meeting and violent language used as
only further evidence of the necessity of
immediate action on some one of the anti
anarchist bills now before Congress.
In speaking this afternoon on the Chi
cago meeting. Senator Cullom said:
"Such a thing is outrageous, and esps
cially so in view of the awful tragedy in
Buffalo. I am in favor of sweeping all
those fellows off into the sea or sending
them somewhere far away from decent
people."
Ought to Be Snuffed Out.
Senator Foraker said:
"If this man is no better than-Czolgo?7! r
as he said, he can't be executedtoo quick
ly. My opinions on this question of vio
lent anarchists are already well known.
Such fellows as this Chicago man ought
to be stamped out of existence without
ceremony."
Senator Hoar said:
"I do not feel called on to express an
opinion every time one of these men uses
violent language. I think the suggestion
which I made yesterday in the Senate to
deport dangerous anarchists to some lone
ly island- where they can govern them
selves a good one for this man from Chi
cago."
. Representative Crumpacker said:
"It is difficult and sometimes dangerous
to deal with these men for the use of lan
guage alone, but the case is becoming ag
gravated and something should be done to
put a stop to such occurrences."
Representative Landis said:
"An island should be dedicated to anar
chists, where these fellows can talk xnil
cut and slash and shoot to their hearts'
content, under their own laws."
Necessity of Legislation.
Representative Ball of Texas said:
"Such occurrences onl^ go to emphasize
the necessity of enacting legislation to
prevent the use of violent language. . I
realize that It is a delicate question, but
it seems to me that something can be
done."
Representative Hamilton said:
"These men ought to be executed in a
lawful manner. If it cannot be done ac
cording to the constitution, let us have
the constitution amended so it can."
BERLIN, Dec. 6.â The long reports of
the proceedings In the United States Sen
ate concerning anarchy which have been
printed here are attracting much atten
tion. Newspapers here express the hope
that the anarchistic breeding grounds In
the United States will be closed to Euro
pean fugitives, thus materially aiding the
efforts of the Continental police.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.âRepresenta
tive Metcalf eays the interests of the
Mare Island Navy Yard will not suffer
by his transfer from the Naval Commit
tee.
"Members of the Naval Committee have
assured me," he says, "that these inter
ests will not be affected by my going off
the committee. Besides, Senator Perkins
is the ranking member of the Senate
Naval Committee, and will see that Mare
Island is well taken care of. I believe I
can do valuable work for the Pacific
Coast in my new position."
Senator Perkins is to be a member of
the Senate Commerce Committee, whlcli
has charge of the river and, harbor and
shipping legislation. He urged the ap
pointment of Senator Bard, but the Sen
ate managers insisted upon Perkins tak
ing the place or H would be given to Sen
ator Mitchell of- Oregon, a candidate for

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1901.
Coast Congressmen Are Working
Hard to Exclude Chinese
Labor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â
The Chinese exclusion bill intro
duced in the House to-day by
Representative Kahn and to be
offered in the Senate next Monday by
Senator Perkins was prepared by Chi
nese Inspector Dunn of San Francisco
and Commissioner of Immigration Pow
derly. This and all other similar meas
ures Introduced in both branches of Con
gress will be considered by a committee
of Senators and Representatives from the
Pacific Coast States which was appointed
for that purpose at the conference of del
egations of California, Oregon. Washing
ton, Nevada and Idaho held to-day. .
This committee expects to submit to the
next conference, on December 16, a meas
ure providing for Chinese exclusion' which
shall meet the approval of the delegation
and which shall contain the important
provisions of all bills 'introduced relating
to this question. The measure as finally
agreed upon will be offered in both
branches and action urged upon it as em
bodying the legislation desired by the
Pacific Coast. . â¢ .
Representative Loud, who presided at
the conference/ appointed the following
committee to take the matter under con
sideration and report its findings at the
next meeting: Senators Foster of Wash
ington, Mitchell , of Oregon, Heltfeld of
Idaho, Representatives Metcalf, Loud and
Coombs, of California and Newlands of
Nevada. .'...- . j
Representative Loud favors the Lodge
Chinese exclusion bill repealing the' lim
itation clause of \ the present act. This
bill, he says, has stood the test of the
courts, while the constitutionality and
legality' of a new bill would probably be
questioned, with perhaps adverse decision
on the material points. .
At the conference to-day Loud was
chosen chairman and Senator Dubois sec
retary. There was a large attendance of
members of .both political parties and the
expression, of opinion in favor t of vigor
ous and effective work was quite general.
Senators Mitchell and Heltfeld and Rep
resentative Loud were especially earnest
in urging action. They took a position in
favor of making the Geary law immedi
ately effective, declaring that' the Chinese
multitude should be kept out of the coun
try for all time.
Chinese Inspector Dunn, ' who is sta
tioned at San Francisco, also made an
address, In which he detailed his experi
ences in this work, pointing out "â¢many
evils which he contended are included in
the promiscuous admission of Chinese.

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOLDEN STATE WHO HAS BEEN
PLACED ON THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE. AND
j * OTHER CONGRESSMEN ASSIGNED BY SPEAKER HENDERSON.
Metcalf 's Appointment May Mean
there Will Be No Revision
of the Tariffs.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1405 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.âRep
resentative Victor Metcalf has
been highly honored by Speaker
Henderson, who to-day i appointed
him a member of the Ways and Means
Committee, which is the most important
committee in the House* of Representa
tives, just as the Finance Committee is in
the Senate. This is an honor that seldonij
falls to a member in his second term, and
Metcalf is receiving the congratulations
of friends. ' , . :.
California has not been represented on
the Ways and Means Committee since Mc-
Kenna was a member. McKinley was
chairman and his every-day contact con
vinced him of McKenna'a ability, and on
becoming President he made him Attor
ney General and then elevated him to the
United States Supreme Court bench; to
succeed Justice Fields.
Metcalf, on this Committee of Ways and
Means, will be in a position to do much
for California, should there be an attempt
to revise the tariff. It Is questionable,
however, whether there will be any at
tempt at revision on the part of the Re
publicans, though, of course, the Demo
crats will urge it. Members will, however,
proceed Immediately to frame a Philippine
tariff bill. ,
No Tariff Revisions.
The selection of Metcalf, it is believed,
indicates the purpose of the House lead
ers not to make tariff revisions or revenue
reductions during the present session.
Republican members of the committee
held a session to-day behind closed doors
to arrange a programme for the early
work of j the session. - After the meeting,"
which lasted an hour, one of the members
said no action was taken except: to dis
cuss the Philippine tariff matter. He said
it was : the intention of the majority to
prepare a bill for immediate Introduction
to meet the situation created by the de
cision of the Supreme Court. He thought
the bill i would be ready next 'week and
would re-establish the old rates.
In connection with the Philippine tariff
a clash has come between- the Senate and
the House. '-' Members of the . Ways and
Means Committee resent the introduction
of the Lodge bill in the Senate and insist
that it robs the House of its constitutional
prerogative of Initiating all legislation for
raising revenue for the Government.
Will Not Accept Lodge Bill.
Chairman Payne was asked by The Call
correspondent to-night if he would accept
the Lodge bill and introduce it In the
House. .
"I shall not," he replied. "We shall have
a- bill of our own."
. There is a precedent for returning Sen
ate bills for raising revenue without ac
tion by, the House, and should the Lodge
bill be sent over this will be done.V V.!i
A leading member of the House said the
probable outcome would be that the House
bill would go over to , the Senate, where
the Lodge bill would be allowed to quietly
drop out of existence.
Import merchants in Manila are prepar
ing a petition, which will be presented to
Congress, asking that Manila be made an
American port, free of duty.

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.âRepresenta
tive Ball of Texas to-day introduced a
resolution ' providing for . a special com
mittee on trusts. In explaining the meas
ure this afternoon Ball said:
"My object Is to eliminate politics from
consideration of the trusts. During the
last session the same trust bills were re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee, which,
by rule adopted for the purpose,- prevent
ed Democrats from even offering amend
ments .or substitutes. The methods* of
getting at the trusts by national legisla
tion are already difficult enough wtlhout
Involving the . matter still more ' by the
referrence of bills to different commit
tees. I have put in three bills attacking
the trusts and they have all gone to sep
arate committees. If the Roberts matter
can have a special committee it seems to
me that the trusts are entitled to It, for
they are of vastly more Importance to
the American people.". .

DEATH LURKS
IN WATER OF
LOBOS CREEK
Spring Valley Company
Must Stop Supply
ing It to City.
Supervisors' Health Commit
tee Hears Testimony of
Experts.
Recommends Passage of Resolution
by the Board Finding That Source
Is Contaminated and Shall â  jj
Be Abandoned. .*?. j5j
The Health Hospital Committee of tha
Board of Supervisors met yesterday . and
recommended the passage of a resolution
ordering the Spring Valley Water Com
pany to Immediately discontinue supply
ing Its consumers with water from Point
Lobos Creek. This action was taken
after three expert city officials, each pur
suing an Independent investigation, had
reported that the water Is contaminated
and a menace to the health and lives of
those who drink It.
There Is hardly a doubt that tha
board will adopt the resolution and In
that event the corporation will have to
draw on Its other sources at the rate of
2,000,000 gallons daily to supply the Inhab
itants of the Richmond district, a largo
portion of the Western Addition and part
of North Beach, who are at present using
the water of Lobos Creek.
. The first report presented to tha com
mittee which had ordered tha taking of
expert evidence on the exact. condition of
Lobos Creek and its watershed was
that of City Engineer Grunsky, who pro
nounced the supply unsuitable for hu
man consumption. His report says:
Lobos Creek Is Polluted.
As heretofore stated In my progress report en
the investigation of water supply for 1900-01.
Lobos Creek is not to be considered a desirable
source of supply and I do not believe that It
would have again been brought Into use had
it not been for the fact that water Is low In
the peniilsula reservoirs of the Sprlnj Valley
system. -
No assurance can be given that Lobos Creek
water can be kept unpolluted. Owing to the
density of population in its watershed the
possibility of pollution must be recognized and
the danger of such pollution will continue to
Increase with the increase of population. Lo
tos Creek should not be- considered a suitable
source of water supply for domestic use. 3
The drainage basin of the creek extends as
far south as Twin Peaks. Including the entire
Alrashouse Tract, and has no visible outlet.
All the run-oft* from the upper portions thereof.
Including a limited quantity of sewage. Is ab
sorbed by the sands south of the park.
City Chemist Green stated that he
would not care to condemn the water
from the limited investigation he had
made. "On account of the presence of
nitrites," said Dr. Green, "the water is
suspicious for drinking purposes, but the
bacteriological examinations are neces
sary to determine if it is polluted. The
water of the deep water wells close to
the sea hold large solutions of sodium
chloride, the presence of which, however,
is not always due to surrounding sew
age."
Water Full of Bacilli.
City Bacteriologist Kellogg testified
that he had examined samples of the wa
ter and found that the bacilli ran about
3300 to the cubic centimeter and some
cases 7300. Some of these were the Vcolon
bacillus" shewing intestinal formation.
Kellogg stated that should typhoid ba
cillus get into the water the danger to
health would be alarmingly increased. \
Dr. H. L. Ryfkogel also made bacterio
logical examinations and corroborated
the findings of Dr. Kellogg in every es
sential detail. He said that to render
Lobos Creek water potable from a bac
teriological point of view It should be
subjected to such filtration as will re
duce the -bacteria to less than 100 per
cubic centimeter.
Attorney Kellogg of the Spring Valley
Company requested that the hearing bo
postponed In order that further examina
tion of the water could be made and that
Chief Engineer Schussler might be heard.
Kellogg would not answer a question as
to the reason why the Lobos Creek water
was utilized when, according to Schusa
ler's last report, the company had a
never-falling supply of pure water.
Chairman D'Ancona ruled that the bur
den of proof was on the company to prove
that the water, which was admittedly
contaminated, had been subjected to per
fect nitration extending over a period of
one year. Dr. D'Ancona had pursued an
independent investigation and put the fol
lowing question to the Spring Valley Com
pany's representatives, who were unable
to answer them in the affirmative:
Efficiency of Filtration.
1. Has a systematic Investigation through a
rainy season ever been mad.:- to determine if in
fact such filtration does occur, or if on the
contrary-, much of the water Is surface water
reaching Lobos Creek without filtration?
2. Has a series of analysis extending through
out an entire year been made to determine If
the efficiency of the filtration is maintained
under different conditions of rainfall throughout
the year?
3. Has a systematic series of chemical and
bacteriological - examinations been made
throughout an entire year to determine the
actual efficiency of the filtration?
4. Has a systematic chemical Analysis been
made showing positively the absence of prod
ucts and derivatives of animal digestion, putre
faction? etc.
Drs. Kellogg, Ryfkogel and Green and
City Engineer Grunsky agreed with Dr.
D'Ancona that the questions contained
the specific requirements to make the wa
ter potable. Representatives of the Rich
mond District Improvement Club urged
immediate actlon'on account of the immi
nent danger to the health of those who
drank the water which was drained
through cemeteries and Inhabited dis
tricts. They deprecated Attorney Kellogg'a
remark that the Point Lobos Improve
ment Club/ was satisfied with the water
and that they were not influenced by good

SENATE COMMITTEE DECIDES
IN FAVOR OF CANAL TREATY

WASHINGTON, Die. Â«5.-The
Senate Committee on

to report favorably the new
Hay-Paunccfote treaty . pro
viding for the construction df an isthmian
canal.
The committee was In session nearly

previsions of the convention. No votea
were cast against It, but it was criticized
very sharply by Senators Money and Ba

treaty. They took especial exception to
the provision continuing in force the neu
trality provision of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty, and also made exception to the
clause specially authorizing the United
States to police the canal, as placing a
limitation upon the power of this country
to absolutely control it. The contention
was made that the effect of the treaty
Â»s sent to the Senate would be to deprive
the 'United States of control of the canal
in case of war. **
One of the Objections.
Especial attention was called to the
provision in the preamble of the pending
treaty reserving article VIII of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty from the repeal
provision of the new treaty. The por
tion of this article of the old treaty to
which objection was made reads as fol

Senators Money and Bacon did not go
to the extent of voting against the re
port of the treaty, and they acknowledge
they are anxious to see It ratified because
of their great desire to have the canal
built. Still they Insisted that the treaty
as it now stands Is very .objectionable in
case of the contingency, of. war.
Rapid Action Is Desired.
Senator Frye presided over the meet
ing, and he authorized Senator Lodge to
report the treaty to the> Senate on Mon
day next in case there should be an ex
ecutive session on that day. It was also
the sense of the committee that the con
sideration of the treaty should be pressed
as speedily as possible, in /the Senate,
some Senators expressing the hope that
action might be secured before the ad
jourriment for the holidays. The com
mittee also voted to recommend that the
Injunction of secrecy be removed from
the treaty.
Senator Bacon moved the revival of the
amendment to the original Hay-Paunce
fote treaty, which' was suggested by Sen
ator Davis, then chairman of the com
mittee, and adopted by the Senate. The
amendment provided, that nothing in
the treaty "should apply to measures
which the United States may find it nec
essary to take for securing, by its own
forces ihe defense of. the United States
and the maintenance â  of public order."
The amendment was voted down viva

Wounded Insurgent ' : Leader s Tells
How Fighting Will Continue.
COLON, Dec. 6.â Colonel Barrera, the
wounded Insurgent leader, who surren
dered and waÂ» brought to Colon, believes
that the revolutionists , will confine fight
ing in the interior of ,the idepartment;-oC
Panama and will certainly not attack'
along the line of the Panama railroad be
fore nest March. Me declares that Gen
eral Porras, the revolutionary leader, has
about 500 men and a good supply of am
munition. Colonel Barrera considers that
practically all of the best insurgent offi
cers on the isthmus have surrendered.
No news has been received from Agua
dulce, where, it is believed, some of Gen
eral Alban's troops have attacked the in
surgent forces under General Victoriano
Lorenzo.
Captain Galloway of the British cruiser
Tribune, with General Alban, left last
evening for Bocas del Toro to settle the
trouble arising from 'the ill' treatment of
two members of the Tribune's crew by
the Colombian Government soldiers.
The Washington Club, composed of em
ployes of the Panama Railroad Company,
entertained on Tuesday evening the offi
cers and crews of all the warships In the
harbor of Colon. The Washington Hotel
was decorated with flag's of the United
States, Great Britain, Germany, France
and Colombia. . -.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.-Secretary Long
has ordered Captain Perry of the battle
ship Iowa, now at Panama, to proceed
down the Chilean coast to Talcahuano,
where the ship -is to be docked and over
hauled. He has also ordered Commander
McCree of the gunboat Machlas, at Colon;
to bring his vessel north, stopping at San
Juan, Porto Rico, on her way home, for
coal. The gunboats Marietta at Colon and
Concord at Panama will remain at their
respective stations for a time and then
they, too, will leave the Isthmus if affairs
retain their present quiet aspect. *

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The Navy De

to-day, dated November 29,- stating , that
the gunboat J Vicksburg went into dock
for the winter at Nieuchwang, China; on
that date. This information relieved' the
naval , officials of quite a ; little anxiety
felt in regard to the welfare of this' ves
sel. It Is explained that the' cable facili
ties near Nieuchwang. are very poor and
accounted for the absence of information
here as to the .Vicksburg's ". whereabouts.

Military Governor Gives the
Reasons for Guerrilla
Warfare.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The War De
partment has made public the first an
nual report of Major General Adna K.
Chaffee, military governor of the Philip
pine .-Islands. ..General -Chaffee sums up
the situation inVthe Philippines f rom= a
.military i point 'of view by., stating -.that
the provinces of'Batangas 'and .Laguna,
in Luzon, and the iislands of ; Samar. Man-;
.dora.^Cebu and Bohol, constitute the. area
ndw disturbed; by any, embodied force ot
Insurgents. says that tb v the physical
character of the country, : to the nature
of the warfare of the rebels, who are
amigo and foe in the same hour, to the
humanity of the troops, which is taken
advantage -of.. by the rebels, and to the
fear ;6f. assassination on the part of
friendiy- disposed if they give information
to the American forces is due the pro
- N lqugatioV of the guerrilla warfare.
â¢ ", Commenting on the plan of gradually
replacing military with civil administra
tion Ueneral Chaitee says:
* "The withdrawal of interference with
'^ivil affairs does not contemplate wlth
draw^i;of the troops from their stations
to any considerable extent; on the con
trary, this should' not be done hastily and
when undertaken -should be gradual and
moro in the nature of concentration than
reduction of force or abandonment of any
considerable area of territory."
He therefore recommends mat there be
no further material reduction of troops
before January, 1W3. The governments
which are being organizedâ provincial and
municipalâ General Chaffee says, are both
new and untried, and there Is but one
certain and reliable method of ascertain
ing the- progress of the Filipinos' in self
government,, namely, observation by. the
army*.*' On the subject of the military gov
ernment ;"of the J city of -Manila General
Chaffee 'saj's:. ;
Order Reigns in Manila.
"In the government of Manila for three
years if the military have done nothing
more it is everywhere apparent that an
excellent foundation has been laid and a
turbulent and hostile community brought
to observe the laws and individually be
orderly. This has been done without un
due harshness or severity of treatment of
the inhabitants."./- -..,,
âIn anticipation of a partial concentra
tion of the troops in the Philippines next
year General Chaffee submits estimates
of cost for the construction of barracks.
He recommends that a permanent, post
be* constructed at once in the vicinity of
Manila 'for a garrison of two squadrons
of cavalry, two batteries of artillery and
two full regiments of infantry, together
with a hospital and storehouse, the whole
to be under the command 'of a brigadier
general. V He gives '$500,000 as a rough es
timate fit cost for this project and says
that $20O;0OO should be available immedi
ately in order to take full advantage of
the dry season for the construction of
permanent quarters at other points .which
may be determined upon. During 1 the
fiscal ydar ending June, .1903. he estimates
that $2,pOQ,000 .will be required: , ;
Slaughter in the Ninth.
General Chaffee devotes a good part of
his report to the terrible disaster which
befell Company, C, .Ninth Infantry, at
Balarigfga, Samarkand which,, he says,
was largely due to overconfidence in as
sumed pacific conditions and in a people
"who to a great extent as yet are strang
ers and unappreciatlve of our humane
policy j>t liberty of beliefs and actions."
*-A tabljfe is submitted, showing that since
June 10 last, the 'date of the last table
submitted .by General MacArthur, yr* to
September 15," 361 Pilipino officers and 3838
men surrendered to the American military
and twenty-six officers and 489. men were
captured. â 
In an appended report General J. P.
Sanger. inspector general of the Division
of the Philippines, in speaking of the dis
cipline of the troops in the aslnnds, notes
a commendable absence of excesses and
serious Infractions of the regulations, but
says that there is great room for im
provement in the matters of dress, ' de
meanor and show of respect in saluting
superior officers, the criticism applying to
officers as well as soldiers. ' -
Judge Advocate General Groesback says
that the suppression of brigandage in
the Philippines most probably will be one
of the trying problems of the future. If
the military arm was left free to deal
with the marauders, he says, there would
be no doubt of their final suppression, but
the Incoming of civil authority compli
cates the military situation.
Great attention is paid in appended re
ports to the subject of the prevalence of
venereal diseases in the army of the Phil
ippines and the vjgorous measures taken
to- segregate dissolute women and by rigid
physical inspection, guard against the
spread of such diseases.
With his own report General Chaffee
submits, those of the commanders of the
military departments in the Philippines
and of the heads of tlie several -staff- de-'
partments.. â¢ â¢: v â Â»*â¢?*â â¢ ?-â¢ 'â¢-â¢'-' â 'â¢â  " ; â  â¢â¢ â  :

Celebrated Trader Leaves
Property Worth Million
Dollars.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Dec. 6.â Mrs. Cathe
rine O'Keefe>0f. this .city received to-day
a letter â  from Joseph Michaels of Yap,
Caroline Islands, a'dvising her of the
probable loss at sea' of her husband, Cap
tain'David B. O'Keefe,.and the fact that
he had left" property - worth probably
91,000,000.'< Michaels has â > applied to the
American Consul at Hongkong to protect
OKeefe's property. Mrs..O'Keefe has en
gaged a law tirm here to look out for her
interests. ..-â <â¢
David O'Keefe was known.in the Orien
tal trade as "King" O'Keefe of Yap,
which island he virtually owned. When
O'Keefe landed at Yap, thirty years ago,
the cannibal natives thought him a demi
god on account of his white skin, and
made him their king. He built up a
profitable trade to Hongkong and owned
two barks that traded between the Caro
lines and Chinese ports.
Last June he went with copra and
other native products to Hongkong, from
which point he sent his wife in this city
a check for 51500. After leaving Hong
kong, the vessel disappeared and Is sup
posed to have teen lost in a storm.
King O'Keefe was 56 years of age and a
native of this city.

Holland Queen Binds Wounr

. band Injured.
LONDON, Dec. 6.â A dispatch to the
Evening News from The Hague, published
to-day, says: "Peace reigns again at the
palace, and the happiest man in Holland
is Major Van Tets, who was wounded in
defense of Queen W'ilhelmina by Prince
Henry, or, as all Dutchman now con
temptuously call him 'the German.'
'â¢Van Tets is one of the ten noble
youths who formed the body guard of the
smiling young Queen when she was mar
ried in February, and who have been since
at their royal mistress' beck and call on
every occasion. They pride themselves on
iheir servitude, and in this matter-of-fact
twentieth century their chivalrous devo
tion to Queen Wiihelmina is a pretty thing
to see.
"It is whispered that every man of the
ten handsome youths who surround her
Majesty's carriage when she drives
abroad, skate with her when she skates,
ride with her when she riaes end dance
attendance on her generally, has been at
one time or another over head and ears in
iove with the dainty little lady in whom
-tioiiaiid's hopes are centered.
â 'Official contradictions notwithstanding,
nobody at The Hague doubts for a mo
ment that the Queen and her consort have
been at loggerheads practically since the
wedding, .frince Henry is an unpleasant
person. He eats too much, drinks too
ireely, and hunting occupies him far more
than his wife. Wiihelmina, on her side, is
jjot a woman to allow herself to be neg
lected with impunity. It is said that she
stanched Van rets' wound with her own
hands and insisted on her husband beg
ging pardon of the Jonkherr as well as of
herself, before she would forgive him. All
the romance of the marriage of Wilhel
xnina and the man she herself chose has
disappeared."

rZLZGATSS DISCUSS
LAW OF PROFESSIONS
Pan-American Congress Votes on
the Question of State
Diplomas.
MEXICO CITY, Dec. 6.â The session to
day of the Pan-American conference was
taken up with a discussion of Chile's
proposition Â» regarding the practice of
learned professions, chiefly whether, even
if accepted, the convention would be of
any practical value. These doubts were
strengthened by the explanations of C. M.
Pepper of the United States delegation to
the effect that in his country" this mat
ter came under State legislation, over
which the Federal authorities had no con
trol.
Gil Fortoul of Venezuela asked Pepper
whether a professional diploma issued in
one of the States of the United States
was recognized in the others. Pepper re
plied that each State made its own terms
and that there was no obligation on the
part of any of them to recognize diplomas
issued in another. Gil Fortoul said that
that was really very serious and he did
not see the use of going any further.
The question was whether the delega
tions were in favor of the proposed con
vention in a general way. This being put
to a vote the convention in general was
accepted by seventeen votes. Bolivia vot
i-g adversely and Uruguay's representa
tive beins absent.
John Barrett of the United States dele
gation presented a letter from E. S. Good
win, director of the Pacific Commercial
Museum of San Francisco, asking that the
branch of the projected Pan-American
Bank be established at San Francisco,
which would enlarge trade relations of
the entire Paciflc Coast with South Amer
ica. The letter was referred to the Pan-
American Bank committee.

SAVES CHILDREN
FROM THE FIRE
Heroic Father Battles
Against Advance of
Flames.
PITTSBURG, Dec. 6.â Two persons were
burned to death and ssven injured in a
fire at Carnegie, Pa., this morning. The
dead are:
MRS. SARAH KLEE, aged 43 years.
MARY KLEE, aged 9 years.
The injured are: Samuel Klee, aged 50
years; Ida Klee, aged 20; Anna Klee,
aged 17; Rachel Klee, aged 14; Eva Klee,
nged 10; Jennie Klee. aged 6; Harry Klee,
aged 4.
The Klee residence was a two-story
house on Broadway, the ground lioor
front being de voted to a grocery store
kept by .Kiee and the rest of the house
being occupied by the family.
The tire was discovered about 4:40 this
morning by the grocery clerk, Morris
Fizis. He immediately gave the alarm,
but the Hames spreaa so rapidly that. the
occupants of the upper story were shut
off trom the stairway. Klee and his wife
realized that the only way to save the
chllaren was to drop them from the win
dow, a distance of about twenty feet.
One by one the children were brought
to the front window and dropped to -the
ground by the father. All of them, were
more or less seriously injured, but all es
caped death from the flames except Mary.
By* the time Harry, the baby, was
reached, the father was almost exnaiisted
and the little one's face and feet and
hands were blistered and burned. He
was snatched from the flames just in
time and it is thought he will survive.
After rescuing his baby, the father
looked around for his wife and being un
able to locate her, he became almost dis
tracted. It seems that while the father
was rescuing the youngest and most
helpless child his wife was making an
attempt to save the life of Mary, and In
doing so gave up her own life. <
The House was destroyed. The charred

WASHINGTON, Dec. ' 6.â During the ex
amination of Dr. "W. P. Carr, who was
called as an expert by the defense to
day in the case of Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine,
on trial for the murder of James Sey

tions of Mrs. Bonine and Ayres when the
shots were fired. . ; .-â¢ â  .
District Attorney Gould said, that the
only person able to give such information
was Mrs. Bonine herself. Counsel for the
defense answered, that the detectives and
the District Attorney and his assistant,
with* their skill and. experience, had elicit
ed from the defendant at. police, head
quarters' a detailed, statement of every
fact and circumstance, and that placing
her on: the stand would adduce nothing

sel based their defense.
j The court held that the question could
be asked as to the effect of the tiring pro

from the object, and also within what
distance the person using the pistol
might have stood in order to inflict
wounds such as were. found upon Ayers'
body. . . â  . ; â¢

ONE MORE JUROR
TO BE SELECTED
Eleven Men Are Sworn
to Try James W.
Brown.
ALTURAS, Dec- 6.â "With the choosing
of one more juror the State will be ready
to .proceed with the trial of James W.
Brown, the alleged leader of the mob
that lynched Calvin Hall, his three sons
and Daniel Yantis near Lookout. In all
probability this twelfth man will be
sworn to-morrow and the opening state
ments of counsel will be made on Mon
day.
Venireman Theodore Lee, during his ex
amination to-day, said that he believed
lynching to be justifiable when the vic
tims were assailants of women,; but in
such caso only. He was sworn. H. P.
Read and "W. L. Smith were both passed
after brief examinations. Read later
asked that he be excused . from serving
on the jury. Under re-examination he
said that he believed his opinion would
influence his verdict, as he believed the
defendant was guilty. Read was the first
talesman to express an opinion unfavor
able to Brown. Deputy Attorney Gen
eral Post asked for an order of court
that Read remain in Alturas as a wit
ness for the people.
/W. T. Smith was sworn to try the case,
making the ninth juror. A. F. Spicer was
passed by both sides, although he said
that he would not believe an Indian's tes
timony. C. H. Caldwell was closely ex
amined by the prosecution as to his sym
pathies with Lookout people, as he lives
near that place, and especially as to his
feeling toward Eades and Levanton, two
of the defendants, with whom he said he
was on very friendly terms. He was
passed by both sides. S. A. Billlck was
passed. He testified that he did not be
lieve in lynch law. Billlck was formerly
a guard in Folsom Prison and testified
that in enforcing law there his
term 'he was obliged with two other
guards to kill a prisoner to prevent a jail

a guard of the Tell County Convict Camp,
last. September, was hanged to-day at
Danville. The trap was sprung at 9:45
o'clock and at 10:05 the body was lowered

Before the lid was placed upon the coffin
the body began moving about. "Wilson
opened his eyes and his whole frame
shook with tremors. He was taken from
the coffin by deputies and carried up the
steps to the scaffold for the purpose of
hanging him again.
When the platform was reached the
body became rigid, remained so for a mo

examined carefully by the physicians, who
finally pronounced him dead, death being
caused by strangulation.

BASEBALL STARS PLAY TO-DAV AT RECREATION PARK
HUNTING MEN
ANTICIPATE A
GREAT SEASON
Interest in the San Hateo
County Hounds
Increases.
Down in San Mateo County a number
of wealthy sportsmen are supporting the
San Mateo County hunt, the only pack
cf drag hounds in all the West. In the
height of the season the fields of horse
men are large and exceptionally well
mounted.
Owing to the nature of the country and
its proximity to the city it is impossible
to hunt either foxes or hares, so recourse
is had to the aniseed bag. The drag is
laid over fixed territory and leaves a
ecent which the hounds follow. To any
one who has never ridden across country
this sounds not only prosaic and com
monplace, but possibly ridiculous. If such
a man, first having learned to ride with
ease, could mount a steady, although not
necessarily a costly, horse he would find
life well worth living; be assured sound
deep, good appetite, good digestion and
be a most desirable companion
either at home or in his place of business.
The "drag" hunt is the only hunt which
can be practiced near San Francisco or
near any large city, owing to the stand
taken by some property owners who ob
ject to having their land ridden over. A
business man vvho cannot leave his office
to hunt the customary, two days a week
can readily utilize the Satursay half-hol
iday. He can easily travel by rail or
el*?ctrie car with tirae to spare bÂ«fore the
master of the hunt calls out, "Now,
Jerry!' 1 to Keating, the clever club hunts
man. â  - â  --'
Most of the men who ride with the San
Mateo hounds have been educated to ride
according to some good method. As far
as hands, seat and the control of a horse
are concerned, they compare favorably
with the best riders in any country.
When the drag hunt of necessity takes
the place of fox hunting it is highly de
sirable to have the hounds well matched
in speed. A few hounds with superior
epeed help ruin eport by giving men who
"bunt to ride" an opportunity of getting
between the leaders and the body of the
pack. They foil the scent with their
steaming horses and unfairly test the pa
tience of the master of the hunt.
A little feeding on the morning of the
hunt will be found a remedy to take some
of tbe pace out of fast bound*. As for tail
hounds, they are of little account in a
run after a drag.
It is highly desirable that gentlemen
who ride with hounds would bear in mind
It Is due master, huntsman and hounds
that they should be free from all undue
Interference by impetuous members of
the hunt, who should Inform themselves
of the* etiquette of hunting. The breed
of hounds known as English fox hounds
are not as musical as some of Grau's del
icately throated operatic stars, and when
ridden over they give up their place in
the concert and instead of leading they
follow the cavalcade.
The effort is to imitate a fox hunt and
not a point-to-point steeplechase. For
the latter Tanforan" racecourse would
bftter be utilized.
The hunt means a gallop across country
of from ten to fifteen miles, with many
Intervening jumps to be negotiated. The
riders should not know in which direction
they are to be taken. Herein lies the
charm of hunting of which a writer has
Bald: "Hunting le the sport of kings, the
image of war without its guilt and only
five and twenty per cent of its danger."
The hounds follow the scent, which has
previously been laid over a zigzag line,
for which ample time should be afforded
the drag boy- One of the chief pleasures
of the sport Is watching the hounds make
their cast as they follow the scent, which
Is apparent to them alone.
The Ean Mateo County hunt will meet
to-day at Moormeads. J. J. Moore's
country place at Fair Oaks. The hounds
â¢will be laid on at 10 o'clock. After the
hunt the members of the fleld will be en
tertained at luncheon by Mr. Moore.
On Wednesday next the meet will be at
Laurel Creek at 2:30 p. m. One week from
to-day the meet will be at Uncle Tom's
Cabin, San Bruno.

GUNMEN SECURE
SMALL RETURNS
OWING TO FOG
Ducks Keep to the Bay
and Avoid Baited
Ponds.
The dense tule fog of last Saturday and
Sunday was like a pall to the gunmen. It
spoiled the shooting for an army of
sportsmen as the news spread about after
Thanksgiving day that the marshes were
full of birds. The trains going to Alva
rado and other points along the southern
bay shore were crowded with men who
expected a good day's shoot. The birds
kept on the bay and were hidden by the
fog. The fog upset all calculations and
instead of ducks tbe shooters gathered
mushrooms, the majority returning to the
city heavily laden with this delicacy.
The reports from Suisun are the same,
none of the preserves yielding any birds.
The majority of the clubs in this district,
including the Ibis and the Teal, are said
to have had their best shooting for this
season, owing to the large quantity of
water about the marsh.
Mr. Morse of the Spooney Gun Club was
the most successful of the members who
shot over the club preserves near Mount
Eden last Sunday. He proved the best
shot of the day, getting nearly the limit.
The other members in attendance affirm
that he was lost to their sight in the fog
for a time and hint at his possibly hav
ing met a market hunter. Mr. Morse
thinks this is merely a little professional
jealousy.
Ed Kerrlson and a friend killed thirteen
canvasbacks last Sunday near Collinsville.
Down at Mount Eden Frank Schultz
killed six ducks in the dense fog. Al
Thlebaut killed 6, Max Rosenthal 19, Al
Newman 12 and Billy Farren 8.
John W. Gates, the steel trust magnate,
and his friends created the greatest stir
of the week among the sportsmen who
find pastime in handling a double-barreled
shotgun. Last Sunday "Billy" Kittle and
other members of the Country Club gave
them a pleasant day on the Marin County
preserves after quail, snipe and ducks.
On Tuesday, despite the rain, they went
to Ingleside and spent the afternoon at
the traps. One member of the party is
American amateur champion and another
has for several years shot at all the big
European meetings, so they had no favors
to ask from the local experts. Otto Feud
ner won the freeze out, but he and Haight
lost the match race, although the former
shot to form and upheld his corner of the
contest.
The visitors all possess the finest guns
to be" obtained. The majority of them
cost more than $500 each and are by, the
most celebrated makers. The trap
shooting experts of the party use the
hammer guns, preferring them to the
hammerless variety. There is said to be
less chance of a miEsflre, which would be
fatal in a tournament where men are
closely matched.
At the annual meeting of the Empire
Gun Club, held on Tuesday, the following
officers were elected for the ensuing year:
James P. Sweeney, president: ,W. O. Cul
len. vice president: J. B. Hauer, secretary
and treasurer; J. Peltier, manager; J. H.
Durst, captain; A. J. Webb, lieutenant
captain, and C. A. Bennett, sergeant at
arm*. The club is In a most prosperous
condition. The members expect good
shooting for the remainder of the season
on their preserves. The recent rains filled
the ponds, which are heavily baited. Birds
in large numbers are seen about the pre
serves daily. Early next year the trap
shooting programme wjll be arranged. It
Is intended to offer valuable prizes in both
open and club events.
Will Play "Sport Vasco."
Eder Jai, the royal Spanish handball
sport, has been transplanted to Central

games will be played this afternoon at 2

The All-Americas and San Franciscos
will open the winter series at Recreation

there are many stanch admirers of the

that he has not forgotten how to casti
gate wrongdoers, and Betsy Bird, in her

Morgan City Insurance Case.
The most, interesting witness yesterday
in the United States Circuit Court in the
case of the Ladue Gold Mining and De
velopment Company against the * Frank
fort Marine Insurance Company was
Captain William B. Seabury. The cap
tain testified that he had recently seen
the wreck of tbe Morgan City and that
it would probably continue to be seen in
the same place for some years to come.
This testimony was drawn out incidental
ly as tending to show that there was a
probable salvage for the underwriters.
The remaining witnesses were R. J.
Tyson and Nathan Frank. The trial will
be resumed this morning. .
Charles Sutro Left Large Estate.
The estate of Charles Sutro has been
appraised at $141,266. The. report of the

BIG WINNINGS
OF PALO ALTO
IN COURSING
Eugene Geary's Phenome
nal Greyhound Heads
the List,
George McE. Malcolm, secretary of the
California Coursing Committee, has com
piled some ihteresting coursing statistics
for volume 7 of the American greyhound
studbook. The book is in the hands of
the printer and will be ready for distri
bution within a week.
A prominent feature of this year's vol
ume and one that will be of interest to
leashmen, is a carefully prepared list of
winning: sires. The data comprise not
only the records of local sires, but those
of noted dogs from every coursing park
in America, whose get reached first or
second place in authorized meetings.
The late Emin Pasha, J. H. Rosseter's
celebrated- greyhound, heads the list of
winning sires. During last season the
get of the celerbated courser figured
twenty-five times as stake winners and
gave to their -sjre a record far In ad
vance of any other dog in America. These
winners â¢ were out of twelve successful
dams. Hs> ... , â  _â  â 
St. Lawrence is second on the list with
seventeen winners out of eight dams;
Skyrocket third, with eight winners out
of five dams: For Freedom fourth, with
eight winners out of five dams, and Bor
der Ruffian fifth, with seven winners out
of five dams. Caliph, the sire of Mon
soon, the winner of this year's Ameri
can Waterloo at St. Louis, figures weli
up on the list.
For Freedom holds first place on the
list of sires of winning puppies, with
five of his get out of two dams to his
credit. WildvTralee and Glen Ayr, a St.
Louis stud dbg, come next, with three
puppies out of one dam credited to each.
St. Lawrence is fourth, on the list, with
two puppies out of two dams as winners.
In the matter of individual'perform
ances Eugene Geary's phenomenal
greyhound Palo Alto again lays claim to
championship honors and makes good
with eight stakes won and second place
in four events.
The fact that the champion has per
formed in high class events and has
competed for laurels with the best cours
ers in the running in his past two seaÂ»
sons of supremacy adds a luster to his
record and classes him as the wonder of
the coursing world. . ,
In giving credit for second, place on the
list of individual performances the rec*
ords are left to speak for themselves.
In the number of winning stakes D.
Walsh's Sacramento Boy figures a point
below Palo Alto, but this record was not'
made in stakes of the class In which
Geary's courser was forced to compete
in his struggle for the season's honors.
One of Sacramento's victories was his
defeat of Beacon in the final of the John
Grace Challenge Cup stake In a hotly
contested course that has gone on record
as one of the best ever witnessed on a
coursing field.- Another was in a class
event, but the remaining five were in up.
country stakes, principally at Sacra
mento, and admittedly not of the stand
ard of the events at the local park.
Jimmie Anthony has six stakes to his
credit, but his winnings, too, were from
performers that are not stars of great
magnitude, and were on outside Jields.
Sylvanus closed the season under similar
conditions, with five winning brackets.
Wedgewood has figured as final flag-get
ter in five events, all in fast company.
Little Sister has four victoricc to her
name, Mayflower four, Flying Fox three,
SIsquoc three and a like number of sec
ond place winnings.
Curtis' Flying Fox and ' Narcissus
showed through the season as winners
whenever they reached a final, and Sterl
& Knowles' uleta has earned a similar
record. Beacon has figured but^once as
â¢a stake winner and once as runner-un
That fact will give his admirers who
have classed him above Palo Alto some
food for thought.
' In the number of stakes won by get
of sires Emin Pasha again leads with
41 entries; St. Lawrence follows with 32,
Skyrocket 11, Border Ruffian 9 and
Royal Flush, the one-time record hold
er, figured twice in finals during last
season.
OPPOSED TO FAKE FIGHTS.
Licenses Will Hereafter Be Issued
Only to Bona Fide Clubs.
The members of the Judiciary and Po
lice committees of the Board of Super
visors placed themselves on record yes
terday as being opposed to fake fights.
A, resolution was adopted increasing the
license tax of $1200 a year to $2500 upon
al Lbona fide athletic clubs to hold boxing
exhibitions next year. , â 
Chairman Reed said the attention of
the Chief of Police should be officially
called to thÂ« fact that all so-called ath
letic clubs which are promoting prize
fights and not athletics should not be per
mitted to hold fistic â¢ exhibitions, even
though they have paid the annual license
tax. '
Supervisor Comte favored an annual
license of $10,000, but this was deemed ex
cessive and might prevent competition.'
Supervisor Stafford thought $2500 a'rea
sonable sum, and in his opinion would
prevent the "Eastern men" from invad
ing the field as in the past.
The resolution adopted provides that
hereafter no license will be granted to
any but bona fide athletic clubs having
gymnasiums and other paraphernalia Be
longing thereto, together with a bona fide
membership list. ' '

RIVAL BOXERS
ARE READY FOR
A HARD FIGHT
Heagerty and Lavigne Ex
pected to Show a
Bustling Bout.
Kid Lavigne and Tim Heagerty are
ready for their fifteen-round bout which
takes place before the Acme Club, Oak
land, next Thursday night. Both light
weights are reported in excellent condi
tion for the battle and a lively bout is
expected. Lavigne will be the favorite
in the betting. The several good battles
the great little man oi lists from Sagmaw
has put up in this city make nira popu
lar here. . JLavigne's long rest irom xne
nghting game and his temperate habits
have maue a new man of him, and tnose
who have seen him work at nis training
quarters down at Bianken's say he win
snow his old-time form.
The resuit ot this contest means much
to .Lavigne. If he succeeds In polishing
ott tne sturdy hgntweignt cnarnpiun ot
Australia ana shows again the lightning
speed he possessed betore he took his
hrst step aown tne ladaer of pugilism
I^avinge will go alter Erne. Lavigne was
tne greatest lightweight nghting machine
the world ever saw. Constant training
impaired his speed and he had to lay oft.
Lavigne's trainers say he is in better
shape now than when he fought Erne
and McKadden in the East Tne Kid Is
confident he can defeat the fighter from
the Antipodes. He says he was never in
better condition, except the time he
trained out here tor his famous fight with
Waicott.
"I feel strong and expect to win easily,"
cays Lavigne. "I am not underrating
Heagerty, however. I have studied his
record. He has beaten some good men.
A number of people in the East think I
can never regain my old form, but I v. Ill
prove I can. . I have taken excellent care
of myself for a year past and will go into
the ring fit to do myself justice."
Heagerty is in excellent condition to
make nÂ»s debut as a fighter in this coun
try. His trainers realize that Lavigne is
perhaps the most formidable man in the
lightweight division, and they are leav
ing no stone unturned to get their man
In shape for the fight.
Considerable interest is being evinced
in the possible outcome of the clash be
tween the lightweights both here and in
the East. * Lavigne was disappointed at
the defeat of Terry McGovern. Had
Terry won he promised Lavigne the next
chance at 128 pounds. Lavigne is much
lighter than when he was on the coast
before and says he can make that weight
nicely. _
The fight will be held in the Exposition
building, Oakland. A large number of
boxing enthusiasts - from this ; city will be
at the ringside. The majority will leave
on the 7:30 p. m. narrow gauge boat. Jack
Kitchen, the official referee of the Acme
Club, will be the third man in the ring.
, Alex Greggains has secured two inter
esting bouts as preliminaries to the meet
ing of Gardner and Carter in Mechanics'
Pavilion on the 20th lnst. Toby Irwin
and Arthur Granfield will box ten rounds
and Billy Snailham and Tommy Gilfeath
er will go the same distance. The latter
bout is for the feather-weight champion
shin of the coast.
Carter is said to be in rugged form.
The "dope book" men will find difficulty
in figuring a winner. Gardner defeated
Carter decisively, although the latter
claimed he was below" weight. Gardner
was defeated by Walcott and Carter In
turn made Walcott strike his colors.
Jim- McDonald will referee the fight. .

GOODALL CUP
THE OBJECT OF
GOLFERS' ENVY
First Match for the Valu
able Trophy To-Day
at Oakland.
On the Presidio links the competition
for the Council's cup is dragging its
weary way along, the second or semi
final round having been reached. It
seems likely the final round will be be
tween John Lawson and H. C. Golcher.
The latter has. been playing a strong
game and for some weeks past has lost
scarcely a match.
No arrangements have been made yet
with regard to the home and home
matches between teams of the San Fran
cisco and Oakland Golf clubs, and it is
not likely the first of the meetings will
take place before the end of the month.
No agreement has been reached as to the
number of men to be included in the
teams, but it is the desire of both cap
tains to make the teams as large as can
satisfactorily be done. It is not unlikely
that they may consist of a dozen men
each. The Oakland team will be chosen
from the following: Ernest R. Folger*
W. P. Johnson, F. S. Stratton. R. M.
Fitzgerald, C. P. Hubbard. J. O. Cadman.
D. T. Be'.den, A. H. Higgins. Arthur
Goodall. J. H. Ames, G. S. Wheaton, T.
R. Hutchinson, J. A. Folger and C. M.
Gayley.
The play in the first competition for
the Goodall cup to-day will give Captain
Orestes Pierce a good idea of the number
of men who may safely be counted on aa
representatives of the Oakland Golf Club.
The contest will be over thirty-six holes,
medal play. In order to get it finished
this afternoon the first couple will be sent
out at noon, the others following aa
quickly as possible. Owing to his excel
lent performance in the contest for the
Mud Lark cup en Thanksgiving day R.
M. Fitzgerald will find himself without a
handicap to-day, though on the holiday
he received ten strokes from E. R. Fol
ger, F. S. Stratton and W. P. Johnson.
Heavy ground suits his style of play, and
he should make a good score this after
noon. W. P. Johnson did not hand in so
good a score on Thanksgiving day as
might have been expected, as he waa put
off his game by having to wait in the
rain while a player preceding him took
sixteen strokes to make the eighth hole.
Though none of the ladies handed in their
scores on Thanksgiving day, some â went
around the course. Some will appear in
the contest this afternoon. With no hand
icap exceeding eighteen, however. It is
hardly possible for a- lady to come out
high in the competition. The struggle
will be among the scratch men, one of
whom is almost certain to prove the win
ner. To become his permanent property
the handsome trophy must be won twice
by the same golfer.
It is to be hoped that some contests
may take place between class B men of
the San Francisco and: Oakland Golf
clubs, as such trials of strength tend to
interest several players who would not se
cure a place on the first team and yet
are enthusiastic golfers. Plenty of ma
terial to make up second teams can be
found In both clubs.
The contest for the Foster cup, now
held by F. B.Findley, was to have been
held on the Fort Baker links. Sausalito.
on Thanksgiving day, but was postponed
on account of the rain and the heavy
condition of the roads leading to the
course. It will be held on the first day
on which the course is in fair condition
and the players can meet.. The military
establishment at Fort Baker Is expected
to help the Sausalito Golf Club materially
as several officers will be quartered there'
Most of them will be likely to take ui>
golf as a means of recreation. The too
luxuriant grass on the Sausalito course is
now being kept down by a flock of sheep
the continual passing of which tends to
level inequalities. It haa been found
however, that the thin sward of Califor
nia Is not so well adapted to sheep as the
deep turf of moister regions, as the feet
of the animals tend to make holes the
turf hot possessing enough resistance

TENNIS COURTS
ARE IN DEMAND
AT ALL TIMES
Inclement Weather Does
Not Dampen Ardor
of Players.
The inclement weather, instead of caus
ing a falling off in the attendance on the
local tennis courts, seems to have in
creased the desire of the experts to play.
As a result when the courts are dry the
players are out in force. The lower class
enthusiasts, who are mostly boys Just
learning the game, are enthusiastic and
are at practice every day the -weather
permits. Most promising of these players
are: J. G. Gibaon Jr.. Harry Gorham,
Herbert Schmidt and Ben Wood. Gorham
and Gibson play a remarkably strong
game and have an excellent style. They
will undoubtedly be heard from shortly.
Schmidt, who has not played for several
years, recently took up the game. He Is
one of the most graceful players in the
club and has pretty strokes, but lacks am
bition and seems to have no desire to win
any of his matches. When he overcomes
this indifference he will surely Xorge to
the front rapidly.
As was expected. Harry Wiehe. the
Stanford crack, and Grant Smith won the
scratch doubles tournament held last
Sunday. Collier and Crowell were the
only other team that had a chance and
they gave a good account of themselves in
the finals^ Smith and Wiehe had never
played together before and their joining:
forces was in the nature of an experiment.
They are probably the best two in the
first class. It was thought they would
make a stronger combination than Smit>
and.JMacGavin, winners of the all-comersj
but those who witnessed their play are
satisfied the latter make a much stronger
team than Wiehe and Smith. Wiehe
plays a better volley game than Mac-
Gavin, but the latter is much stronger at
lobbing. The success of Smith and Mac-
Gavin is due greatly to their ability to
lob, at which style of game they are ex
pert.
The Wood brothers caused a genuine
surprise on Sunday by beating 1 Kuehn
and Gibson, two of the best men in the
third class. The Woods are fourth class
men, but are rapidly coming to the front
as a team and will bear watching in fu
ture handicap events.
The tennis players of the University of
California are already practicing con
stantly and look to be sure winners In the
next Intercollegiate games. The Stanford
men are at a disadvantage, as the courts
at that place are not fit to play on. Stan
ford is badly in need of some good courts
and until they are built she will not cut
much of a figure in tennis. The Stanford
men can get no practice, as local players
will not play on their courts. Berkeley
has but one court, but It Is a first-class
one. while Stanford's four are In fact not
courts at all.
There will be a handicap doubles tourna
ment for the Davis cups to-morrow. The
present holders are Chet Smith and James
Code. Other teams that will compete are:
Collier and Crowell. Hunt and Cornell.
Kuehn and Gibson, Gorham and Erskine.
P. Collier and Powers. Parker and Gard
ner and the Wood brothers.
The biggest tournament of the year is
being planned for Christmas day. It will
be a class singles. The tournament will*
be started on the Sunday before Christ-^
mas and as much of it finished as pos
sible. The finals will be played on Christ
mas.

BIRKENRUTH TAKES A TUMBLE
PILOTING ONE-EYED SUGDEN
.Sir Lewis Outfoots the Speedy Muresca, Winning
Handily â Buchanan First on Waterscratch.
JUST at this stage of the game
Birkenruth is experiencing more
trouble at Oakland track than a
hobo trying to break Into an
"empty" among one of the east
bound freights out of Sacramento, Only
Thursday Louis Ezell's promising light
weight earned a fifteen-day vacation on
the ground for causing a mixup at the
Hr&t turn, and yesterday Sugden fell with
him on the far turn. It occurred in the
last race and the intrepid youngster es
caped with a coating of mud about two
feet thick. He was mounted on Sugden,
the heavily played 2 to 1 favorite for the
last race, and was lying third to Gusto
and Ben Ledi when the horse stepped in
a hole and went down. The mishap oc
casioned much sorrow among the already
thoroughly subdued talent. The event
â went \o Gusto, which breezed in before
Ben Ledi at odds of S to 1, with Hoar In
saddle.
The track was dry, sticky and slushy In
spots, and some of the fields resemoled
pool balls on a table, so scattered were
the starters as their pilots. endeavored to
pick the better footing. Altogether it was
a most trying day on â â  bettors and their
finances, as all six < favorites were
knocked down. Only one real rank out
sider stepped in, the other five purses
falling to second and third choices.
While the maiden two-year-old event
looked a good thing for Budd "Wade,
which was Installed a 4 to 5 favorite, the
Schxelber entry again failed to - land.
Cathello, the Burns & Waterhouse cast
off and 9 to 1 in the ring, won by a
length. The favorite was ridden out to
bea Rosarie for the place, '
Bedner, which Frank Doss purchased
Eome time ago from P. Ryan, took the
live and a half furlong sprint for all
ages at odds of 5 and 6 to L Edinborough
led almost to the wire, when under Bull
man's vigorous riding, Bedner collared
and beat him a neck. Nellie Forrest
came from far back, finishing a good
third.
A mixed bunch of starters In the third
number finally saw Alzura go to the post
a mild favorite. She displayed no decided
fondness for the track, finishing unplaced.
Buchanan on the two-year-old â Water
scratch rode a well judged race, beating
out the 15 to 1 shot Parsifal two lengths.
Quadra "showed."
There probably never was a more lucky
horse than Imperious. . At the start of
the mile selling run Merops, the favorite,
"bucked," losing a dozen lengths or more.
This gave Matthews on Imperious an op
portunity to steal away, and when it came
to the closing argument, the old fellow
lasted long enough to beat the first choice
out half a length. But for his display
of temper Merops would have won hands
down. Alicia made a poor showing, fin
ishing a trashy third.
Lightened by several pounds from her
previous race Muresca. came very close to
landing the three-quarter selling sprint
Not that she was best, for Sir Lewis al
ways held her safe, only Larry Daly on
the latter nearly tossed it off through
overconfidence. As it was. Sir Lewis got
the verdict by a head. Colonial Girl had
s=uch a string of followers that she closed
favorite,- but never got near the firing
line.

because of getting left at the post on

was assessed $50 by the judges for rough
riding. He carried wide and bumped

for her new owners.

ANOTHER CLOSE
BASEBALL GAME
IN THE SOUTH
Nationals Defeat Angels
by a Score of
4 to 3.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.â The Nationals
took another game to-day from Los An
geles by the narrow margin of 4 to 3. It
all came in the latter half of the ninth.
Up to that point Hale had held the East
erners down, to three scattering hits. It
was a splendid exhibition of ball all the
way through. The locals played with a
vim and determination that has seldom
characterized their work. - â â â  \
Hall did the best work, accepting many
chances and fielding every bail" perfectly.
Keilley was at short and Kelly on third.
The latter's error in the ninth inning was
responsible for one run. Hale pitched
great ball up to the disastrous ninth,
when the heavy sluggers from the East
lined out three 1 singles and a double,
which, with two errors, gave them the
game. Doyle for the visitors was given
splendid support. Carr's failure to ac
cept two chances in right field gave the
locals two runs.
Van Haltren's base-running and Beck
ley's batting were features greatly ad
mired by. the spectators. Tip O'Neill Is
worrying over the non-arrival of Lee,
star twlrler for the Nationals. He was
expected yesterday, but has not put in
an appearance and cannot be located. -
brasswork on the boats stolen. The thieves
did their work so roughly that the boats
were badly damaged and will need exten
sive repairs.
The Dolphin . Boating Club will hold an
al fresco dinner on Arcadia Island on Sun
day, December 15. The members are tak
ing a good deal of interest in rowing dur
ing the winter and from time to time en
gage in barge . races, ; the losers providing
dinner for the winners and themselves.
Early next year the Dolphins will give
an entertainment and ball in place of the
annual picnic, which will be discontin
ued. There was some : talk of giving â  up
the regular annual dinner of the mem
bers, but it is probable it will take place
as usual. early next year. As many, ex
penses have been incurred during 1901
which will not be necessary during the
coming season the club expects â¢ to have
a full treasury. . . . , . .

PEKING, Dec. 6.â The principal object
of the visit to Peking of Yuan Shi Kal,
the new Viceroy of Chili, who arrived
here December 3, is to induce the foreign
powers 'to relinquish their control of-.the
government of Tientsin; Yuan Shi Kal
has assured all the Ministers of the for

able and willing to maintain order at
Tientsin and in the province.
The Russian, American and Japanese
Ministers are inclined to comply with this
suggestion of the Viceroy, but the major

that the powers retain control of Tien

SEVENTEEN MONTHS ON THE SEA
AND COMES BACK IN DISTRESS
Schooner Cordelia Heald Leaves Here for Alaska, but
Erratically Sails Far From Her Course.
THE STEAM" SCHOONER CORDELIA HEALD THAT HAS BEEN TRYING VAINLY FOR SEVENTEEN MONTHS
TO MAKE ST. MICHAEL AND HER CREW, WHO APPEAR NOT IN THE LEAST DISCOURAGED BY THE
WEARISOME STRUGGLE AGAINST FATE. -'?.';
A. FTER seventeen months spent In
a vain attempt to reach the gold
fields, the steam schooner Cor
delia Heald returned to port
yesterday. She passed inside -tho
gate early in the morning, but at 3 p.m."
had failed to reach . Fort Point. It was
blowing hard, but the craft would not
steer and every wave threw her two
points off her course. When a Call re
porter went aboard the little craft off the
Cliff House the first thing Captain Heald
asked for was tobacco. -Luckily the crew
of Peterson's launch had three packages
of fine cut and these were taken aboard.
Mate Platt made himself a cigarette and
the ; captain filled -his pipe, . but it was
burned out, as he had been smoking tea
leaves for ten days. "Now if I only had
a pipe," said he, "I would be in heaven."
Artist Bronstrup had a pipe and offered
it to Heald, who seized it and in two
minutes the dingy cabin of the Cordelia
Heald . was filled with the fragrance of
cavendish. 1
Even a couple of bottles of beer 'and a
package of sandwiches that were passed
aboard could not tempt the men to de
sist from smoking. While the captain and
the mate were below the vessel was left
to the tender mercies of a reporter whom
the captain took to be a pilot. The news
paper man kept her clear of Point Lobos,
but his heart was in his mouth when the
steamship John S. Kimball bore down on
the schooner and the Heald I would not
pay off.*-'- The danger was averted, how
ever, and then Captain Heald took charge.
Regarding his trip Captain Heald said:
The Cordelia Heald was built, by me in : .San
Francisco about two years ago. My wife and
I -cleared the vessel for St. Michael and we
sailed on August 24, 1900. We had a 'terrible
time and were driven â  back I every time we
reached the Columbia River. Finally, on De
cember 21, 1900. I found myself off San Pedro
and we put in there.
My wife,' after whom the boat Is named, got
tired of the venture at this point and . went to

MALVERN, Ark., Dec. 6.â Five more

night. Maggie Stevenson, colored, of

again for Alaska. That was on July 27, 1901.
The full crew list was myselfâ Captain John
L. Healdâ George H. Moseley. first mate, and
A. A. Platt,. second mate and cook. After we
were out forty-three days I decided it was
time to put into Port Harford and get some
more stores. We secured a liberal supply and
once more started north. .
By this time I had decided to make for the
Kla math River, but every time . we came
within - striking distance something happened
to drive us back. â 
Now I'll tell you something In confidence.
The Cordelia Heald is the finest sea boat afloat.
Never a sea broke over us and she is now as
dry as a bone, but she. can't sail' and she
won't steer. Otherwise she Is the finest vessel

as Mendocino and twice found ' ourselves off
Point Reyes we came â  to "the conclusion' to
make one more try. Then occurred the only
disaster.- We were- Once more off the Oregon

This was- on 'the night of October 8. Platt
and -I were asleep. Suddenly there was a
racket Oil deck and Moseley was tumbling down
the companion way, while the vessel was roll
ing her masts out. I rushed on deck and Platt
took care of the injured man. He only, lived
a few minutes, as his skull was fractured. I
think he wag struck by the main boom and
knocked down the stairs.
We could not give him a fair burial, but
Flatt sewed him up in a spare sail and brought
him aft to the wheel, where I was on duty.. I
said a prayer,' keeping an eye on the foresail
and the heave of the sea at the same time,
and- then the body was thrown overboard.
Moseley was a native of Rutledge, Ga.. and
was 25 years old. He served In the United
States army in the Philippines and had a good
record. After that accident we ran for San
Francisco and reached the Farallonea in six
days. Off there a pilot-boat came up to us
and a "pilot came aboard, but I didn't want
him. Lucky for him. â  He'd have been ten days
at sea. We have plenty of provisions, except
tobacco and butter, and the former you have
supplied us with. I'll get to an anchorage In

PAOIB 10 CODFISHERIBS.
ONE of the large industries of the Pacific Coast
which at this time needs from the Govern
ment an assistance it can readily give, but
which no other power can adequately provide, is that
engaged in codfishing. In the industry there have been
invested many thousands of dollars, and it employs
many hundreds of men. It is capable, under proper
supervision, of continuing indefinitely as a source of
wealth, and consequently merits such protection as
the Government can bestow.
At the present time the industry, has a Tight to ex
pect from the Government two services. The first is
diplomatic, and involves the settlement of the right
of American fishers to catch cod in certain portions
of Okhotsk Sea, ov^r which Russia claims control.
The second is that of providing for the propagation
of codfish at certain stations along the Alaskan coast
where the conditions for the propagation are most
favorable. \ .
The Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
have taken the subject up and have prepared an in
structive memorial upon it. It appears from the
statements of the memorial that within the last few
years our codfishing industry has so expanded as to
enable us not only to supply our own market but to
place our product in Chicago in competition with the
Atlantic cod, to compete on the west coast of South
America with goods from Norway, in Australia and
New Zealand with the ling cod from Scotland, and
to replace in a great measure with our codfish the
dried fish from Japan, in Hongkong, the Philippines
and the East generally as far as the Straits Settle
ments. Statistics compiled by one of the fishing com
panies show that since 1870 there have been brought
into this port Pacific codfish to the wholesale value
of $5,130,000.
It will be conceded that an industry of such mag
nitude and with such possibilities is worth preserving.
It is threatened, however, by the interference of Rus
sia with American fishers in Okhotsk Sea and by the
diminishing number of fish along the Alaskan coast.
Concerning those difficulties of the industry the
memorial says: "In former years the greater por
tion of our supply of codfish came from Okhotsk
Sea, where the fishing banks are much more extensive
than are those of Bering Sea, but a ruling of the Rus
stafi Government imposes a license on all vessels fish
ing within thirty miles of the shore, and in 1892 one
of our vessels narrowly escaped seizure for getting
within the prescribed zone at a time when the ex
istence of the regulations was not known here.
Being driven from the Okhotsk, all the fishing vessels
are compelled to rendezvous in the restricted fishing
grounds in Bering Sea, where the supply is notably
growing less.". - â  ;
Upon that showing two things are asked: First,
that the Department of State make an early deter
mination of our rights on the fishing banks of
Okhotsk Sea, thereby, if possible, enabling our craft
to renew operations in those waters. Second, to pro
cure the establishment and maintenance on the coast
of Alaska of one or more hatcheries for the propa
gation of cod, similar to those maintained by tfie
Government, on .the coast of Massachusetts.
The requests are not excessive! It is only fair that
the Government pay as much attention to Pacific
fisheries as to those of the Atlantic. It is gratifying
to have po energetic a body as the Manufacturers'
and Producers* Association at work In promoting
the interests of this as well as other Pacific Coast in
dustries, and our delegation in Congress should, co
operate in the work and urge the matter upon the
immediate attention of the Government.
If is said that Americans at the Pan-American
Congress' who went there for the purpose of seeing
what they could do in the way of arranging for trade
have found the South American delegates very af
fable and polite, but extremely evasive on business
propositions. They are willing enough to talk, so
long as the talk doesn't bind them to a trade.
Sir Thomas Lipton has said that only a pulse boat
was between him and victory in the recent yacht
contest. This may be one way of taking consolation
cut of the stem fact of defeat
CONGRESS AND ITS WORK.
DESPITE the fact that Congress is, not ex
pected to get to work before the holidays,
there has been a notable activity in getting
ready^for it. Upon many important subjects, such as
the isthmian canal, Chinese restriction and the Philip
pine tariff, bills have been already introduced. These_
will be put into shape by the committees presumably
without much delay and will be ready to be taken up
at any time. Consequently it is hardly fair to say that
no work will be done before Christmas, for good
preparation counts as work as well as does accom
plishment.
One of the notable features of this'Congress is the
confidence with which the public -waits its action.
At the time of the assembling' of a new Congress for
many a year past there has been always more or less
doubt as tc'what action it would take on many meas
ures of grave public concern. It can be readily re
called with what anxiety the business world waited
to learn what was to be done with the tariff, the cur
rency and the situation in Cuba. E-ven when the pre
ceding TTongress met and when there was no longer
any question of the financial or the fiscal system of
the nation at stake there was uncertainty concerning
cur trade relations with Porto Rico and the Philip
pines. No such anxiety is felt now. It is everywhere
taken as well assured that the reciprocity treaties will
be rejected by the Senate, the Philippine tariff will be
made to correspond with the needs of American in
dustry, an isthmian canal bill will be enacted and the
exclusion of Chinese will be adopted as a permanent
policy of the country.
By reason of the confidence felt by the country as
to the action of Congress on all these issues which
are uppermost in the public mind it would seem that
the proceedings of the session would be dull and un
interesting. Where a given decision upon any issue
is a foregone conclusion people are not likely to pay
much attention to the formal proceedings that lead
up to it Therefore if this Congress had nothing
else to deal with than the subjects which have been
so much discussed it would probably interest few
people. It happens, however, that there will come
before Congress during the session several measures
of importance which as yet have not attracted much
of popular attention, and out of some of them there
may arise discussions which will become more or less
exciting to the country as a whole.
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that while the
Republicans will be content to let well enough alone,
and would be satisfied with a quiet and uneventful
session, the Democrats will do their uttermost to
force a fight on some question that will give them a
cause upon which to appeal to the people in the Con
gressional elections next fall. At present that party
has no national policy; it has not even an issue. It
is therefore up to the Democratic leaders m Congress
to do something this winter that will give rise to
party division and a party fight.
It is not clear what' course will be pursued in the
search for the needed issue. Such attempts as were
made in the Democratic caucus to outline a policy
for the session had no other effect than to cause dis
sensions in the caucus itself, and in the end all reso
lutions of the kind were referred to fi. committee,"
The prospects of the party, therefore, are not bright.
It is probable even that by the end of the session they
may emerge without having formed a single* issue
upon which they can make a united fight in the fall
campaign.
In this "condition of affairs there is nothing to be
regretted. We are now in the full flood of prosperity, .
and two years of business unfretted by political dis
turbances will be beneficial to all. The failure of the
Democrats to find an issue is not due to their stupid
ity alone, for as a matter of fact there is hardly any
issue to find. The affairs of the republic are well ad
ministered^ and where legislation is needed, as in re
gard to Chinese immigration- or the isthmian canal,
no party divisions are possible. A . quiet session,
therefore, would be acceptable to the whole country.
As a rule New Jersey is too well satisfied with her
self to take notice of criticisms, but just now she is
trying to explain why it is that both plutocrats and
anarchists are making their homes there in greater
numbers than in any other part of the Union.
RAIN, COMMERCE AND POLITICS.
FOR a long time it has been known to observant
students of politics in countries where govern
ment is dependent upon the popular will that
in years of prosperity the majority vote is on the side
of the party in power, but in bad years the majority
votes with the opposition. The principle underlying
that phenomenon has been presented in an interest
ing article in the current number of the Popular
Science Monthly by H. Helm Clayton of the Blue
Hill Meteorological Observatory, ,and the facts cited
by him show a close coincidence ofj commercial
panics and political disturbances with seasons of defi
cient rainfall.
Mr. Clayton says: "As a professional investigator
of science I am frequently brought to consider the
tremendous influences that natural phenomena in the
earth,", air and sky have on human affairs and to
wonder that .these influences on man's political and
business relations are not more frequently consid
ered." As a matter of fact they have been consid
ered much more frequently than scientists suppose,
but the consideration has not led to any valuable re
sults because the details of the subject have not been
scientifically studied by competent men and the con
clusions presented in a convincing way. It is for that
reason that even this brief presentation of Mr. Clay
ton's studies will be received ; with gratification as a
valuable contribution to a subject which has long en
gaged more or less of public attention. *
The statistics of rainfall presented in the paper
show that a deficient rainfall preceded the panic of
1837, the panic of 1857, that of 1873 and that of 1893.
Each of those panics was followed by a vote of the
people adverse to the party in power. There was a
deficient rainfall in 1863 and- 1864, but in those years
the disturbances of business and politics caused by
the Civil War were so great as to rendep.it impos
sible to, determine how far-the lack of rain, affected
either the one or the other. j:/;^/.'^.
It is well known that' parties in power always claim
for themselves whatever prosperity prevails in the
country at the time, and, judging by, the popular vote,
the people appear to admit the validity of the claim.
Commenting upon that fact the writer says:'' '-To
designate as a superstition the belief in the capacity
of the various political parties in power to make pros
perity may be extreme, but; certainly careful thinkers
will join 7 in the wish that such relations to natural
phenomena as are here outlined might be carefully
studied by trained investigators using well-known
scientific methods. Perhaps,; then, a unity of belief
as to the causes of commercial distress might be ob
tained equaling that which has prevailed since Dar
win's day as to the caus'es of variety and changes 'of
form in 1 he animal kingdom." JT".^ 1
It -will not be denied that the scientific study; pro-
THE SAIN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1901.
posed would be beneficial, but it is safe to say . it
would not have the r far-reaching effect. Mr. Clayton
supposes. Parties in power do not' control the rain
fall, nor can they prevent the hard- times which follow
the consequent loss,cf crops, but they can. do much,
â¢to relieve- the distress by- the enactment of legislation
intelligently! devised to malte.'the," : best ofa bad situa
tion. To that extent, therefore, a! party is really re
sponsible for the condition of industry and. com
merce. We had an example 'of it in the immediate
resumption of industrial and commercial activity as
soon as the. election. of McKinley restored confidence
in financial circles^ Politics is not so blind, a thing
as scientists suppose.. The people are not* wholly
superstitious fools. "They generally know what set of
m&n is best to trust" in any' particular emergency, 1
and 'they vote accordingly. .
A seat in - Congress this winter is more pleasant
than ever before, for^instead of' the old-fashioned
cane-bottom chairs the members now have elab
orately upholstered mahogany, and can sit with
something of the dignity of a plutocrat on velvet. .
AN American traveler and observer in Germany
reports that in Saxony there exists a curious
but efficacious way of collecting delinquent
taxes and bad debts. ~ The law, it is said, provides;
that whenever' a citizen neglects, to pay his taxes or a
debt for which judgment has been obtained
him his name shall be posted officially in every: beer,
garden or^eellar in the city, and so long as it remains
there no dealer is; permitted to sell him a ; drink.-
Failure to obey the' law imposes upon the beer seller!,
a heavy fine for the first offense, and for the second:
a forfeiture of his license.
Whether such a law exists may be doubtful. The
Germans may have a way of joshing Americans
even as we josh foreigners who visit us,- and besides
the law appears to be too wise to be really practicable
in any community. Nevertheless, it has features that
merit attention. How -would it work in San Fran
cisco, for example?
How many bad debtors we have in the community
we know not, but there are enough delinquent tax
payers to give the measure a pretty severe trial. Sup
pose all their names were to be blazoned in every
drinking-place in town. There would be a good job
and a long one for the name-poster to begin with.
Then when the saloon-keeper realized that he had to
know all those names and the men who bear them he
would have to hire one or two employes to attend to
that part of the saloon business, and that would af
ford work for more of the unemployed. Thus the
industrial condition of the city would be improved
at once and the law would score a public benefit at
the very start. :.
Next there would be the moral improvement. The
delinquent taxpayer who could not get a drink would
perforce remain sober. He might never pay his
taxes, but in every other respect, except a tendency
to profanity, he would be a better man. What the
saloon-keepers lost might go into the homes of the
community, or perhaps be dropped into the hands
of the Salvation Army for the benefit of the poor.
There would thus be an increase of happiness in the
home and charity on the streets that wbuld make the
city glow with a new light, and San Francisco would
be an illumination to all the surrounding country.
In the very midst of these sanguine expectations,
however, there comes a thought that gives us pause.
Perhaps if delinquent taxpayers and bad debtors in
San Francisco were debarred from drinks the saloons
would close up and quit business. Instead of employ
ing new men they would discharge those they have.
The ranks of the unemployed would be increased.
The delinquents might move to Oakland to live and
leave the city depopulated. InÂ«short, the law is prob
ably too good for our stage of civilization. It will
do for a subject for academic discussion, but it won't
fit into our politics. The Saxons may keep it.
Eastern students of sociology have noted of re
cent years a marked increase of suits brought " by
men against others for damages for an alleged
alienation of a wife's affections, and they are de
bating whether the increase signifies a rise in the
market value of a wife's affection or only a keener
desire on the part of the husband to get what it is
worth, no matter how little.
GRITICISMS upon Commissioner Evans for
his management of the Pension Bureau have
been so frequent and at times so strong that
reports have been again and again in circulation that
he would be removed from his office. It is therefore,
interesting to note that'his work" has been cordially
commended by his superior, ; the Secretary of the In
terior, and it would appear, therefore, that he will
be sustained by the administration, notwithstanding
the powerful influences opposed to him. , r ,;
'In referring to, the work of the Pension ; Bureau
during the past year the Secretary begins by saying:
"The report of Commissioner Evans should be care
fully read by his countrymen in order that they may
properly understand the great responsibilities of his
office and the exceeding difficulties which he has en
countered in faithfully discharging' its duties. He
has no option, and should have no desire, to do
otherwise than conform to the plain direction of the
law in the disbursement of the enormous appropria
tion made for the payment of pensions. The veterans
have no m*re sincere friend than their comrade, the
Commissioner, who himself served as an enlisted man
in the armies of the Union; and he but maintains
and defends the honor of their, patriotic service when,
refusing to ignore both the letter and spirit of the
law, he declines to permit the impostor, whether
claimant or agent, to share in the bounty which is
provided for'tlie veteran and those dependent upon
him." â 'â¢
It is not customary for. the heads of the great de
partments of the Government to speak so^ warmly of
the work of their subordinates, and the commendation
given to Commissioner Evans. may therefore be ac
cepted as a reply 'to the attacks made upon him. It
is an- official notice that the- administration indorses
his management of the bureau, and regards an attack
upon him as in some measure an attack upon itself.
There can be but little doubt that the public will in
dorse the action of the. administration in this matter
as cordially as the Secretary has indorsed the Com
missioner. -':- Many of the attacks upon Evans are
based upon: Charges essentially false. . Himself a
veteran of the Civil War, he certainly has no preju
dice against his former, comrades in arms. His fight
has been against fraud" and not against the claim of
'any one justly. entitled to a pension. Â»In short, he has
been a faithfulofficer and merits the support due to
the right man in, the right place.

OF THE LATE PRESIDENT McKINLEY.
CHICAGO Jewelers have Just Joined in the recently launched movement to
have the hands on dummy clocks, which since 1865 have pointed to 8:18
: o'clock, changed to 3:55, which is the time when- McKinley was shot.
. all over the country have been discussing the feasibility of
: -the change, but not until a few days ago had it been tried. L. S.
.Grout painted the first clock faca with the hands at the new hour. "Daddy*
Washbura, the New York sign painter who is said to have originated the plan
for. honoring Lincoln, has not as yet given an opinion on the change, although
he. is still in the clock painting business. .
. The clocks referred to are sign3 .which are hung in front of jewelers' shops.
L. S. Grout is a sign painter who makes a specialty of dummy clocks. Of the
1000 of these signs which are sold every year in this country Mr. Grout Is cred
ited with the creation of 600. He makes clocks of all sizes and of all degrees of
elaborateness. â ' .-â¢".â¢ :

Lovers of beautifuly bound books ar^
intensely interested in the Grclier So

been started In Great Russell str

the United States.
The Grolier Society, as the name sug
gests, is intended to supply but one com^
modity of booksâ that class of books only
which will meet the requirements >
lectors and connoisseurs who appr
limited editions, bold type, broad mar

fine, and. indeed, 1s expected in a few
years to be worth three times its present

I hear that about a hundred different
biographies of the King and Queed are
in preparation and will see the ligh'
next year.
In his attitude toward the literary
Â¦world the King, I hear. Is continuing th Â¦.
wholesome tradition established by Queen
Victoria. Presentation copies of new
works which are sent by authors with i
view to self-advertisement are returned
or ignored, but the utmost consideration
is given applications for permission t >
forward a copy to the Royal Library.
In these matters the Windsor librarian
âand it is only he who comes in contact
with the authors in this aspectâ has suit
able discretion, which he e-xercises. It is
admitted, with care and satisfaction.
Some important works are sent to th^
Royal Library by their publishers under
well understood discretion exercised by
themselves, but there is no systematic
examination of new book lists with ,i
view to purchase.
Three of the most notable books of tho
autumn publishing season are from the
pens of well-known society women.
"La Chartreuse of Parma" has been
translated by Lady Mary Lloyd, who is
aunt of Lord Dondughmore and his two
pretty artistic slaters.
Lady Mabel Howard, who wrote "The
Failure of Success," is a sister of Lord
Antrim. Lady Mabel married Mr. How
ard of Greystoke Castle, Penrith, over
twenty years ago. Husband and wif^
have just been entertaining their kins
man. Sir Redvers Buller, whose cause
they are enthusiastically championing,
and Mr. Howard has abandoned Liberal
Unionism as a protest against the treat
ment meted out to the general.

MERCHANTS SEEK
RAILROAD'S GOLD
Sue to Recover Millions
Prom the White
Pas 3 Line.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C, Dec. 6.â A suit in
volving many millions of dollars will be
instituted soon by Higgin & Elliott of
this city against the British Yukon Com
pany, under which name thj White Pass
and Yukon route is registered, on behalf
of a number of Victoria merchants doing
business with the Yukon district. The
claimants ask for the return of all
moneys the White Pass and Yukon Rail
way has taken for freight and passenger
traffic since the railway was put into
operation in 1898. The action will .be tried
before the Supreme Court in Victoria and
will go In turn to the highest court in
the land, the Imperial Privy Council. Â«
The contention of claimants is that un
der its charter the White Pass and
Yukon Railway is compelled to have its
schedule of rates approved by the Do
minion Government. According to ad
vices received from Ottawa this approval
has not been ordered, although agents of
the railway company are now in Ottawa
endeavoring to make arrangements to
that end. it seems that the railway com
pany did not submit its schedule in Ot
tawa until this year and the schedules
have been returned by the Minister of
Kail ways for adjustment-
Claimants contend that the rates
charged by the White Pass and Yukon
Railway were extortionate and that they
are entitled, therefore, to a return of,
their money. Not only do they allege
that the rates were extortionate, but that
secret rebates were granted to competi
tors. When the amount of the total rates
paid to the company since its operation
are taken into account, the sum to be
refunded, should the action be decided
iigainst the company, will run into the
millions.
The claimants meet the suggestion that
the road starts from Skagway, in Amer
ican territory, by the claim that Skagway
is in Canada and is claimed by Canada.
The charter of the railway company
reads that the road shall be built from
some point at the head of Lynn Canal to
Selkirk, In Northwest Territory. The mer
chants who are suing rely on section 290
of the Canadian railway act, which reads:
Every person from whom any railway com
pany exacts any unjust or- extortionate - toll,
rate or charge shall, in addition to the amount
po unjustly exacted, be entitled to recover from
the company, as damages, an amount equal to
threÂ» times the amount so unjustly exacted.
A number of cases are instanced where
b jits have bern decided against railway
companies on this ground.
Pinioned Under Fallen Tree.
SANTA ROSA. Dec. Câ Henry Cox of
Occidental had a narrow escape from
death yesterday. He was engaged . in
chopping down a large oak tree. . It fell
in the wrong direction and pinioned him
to the ground. After an hour's work
Cox'* companions extricated him from
his position. While one of his legs was
broken in two - places, he was not
badly hurt otherwise. One of the limbs
had prevented the body of the tree fail
ing directly upon him. although he was
pinioned just beneath it.

DRUGGIST FACES
MURDER CHARGE
Serious Accusation Is
Preferred Against
T. M. Lash.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 6.â T. M. Lash, for
twenty years a druggist In this city and
known throughout the State as the manu
facturer of certain proprietary tonics and
bitters, was arrested this afternoon on a
complaint charging him with murder. The
accusation was sworn to by Mrs. Virginia
Buck, mother of Mrs. Xellie Dewey, who
died on November 15 and was buried four
days thereafter. Mrs. Buck charges that
Lash caused her daughter's death by
means of a criminal operation. The Coro
ner was not notified of the death, and the
certificate, signed by Dr. C. O. Cartwrlght,
one of the most prominent physicians in
the city, gave blood poisoning as the cause
of the young woman's demise. Afterward
It developed that when Dr. Cartwright
was -called into the case he informed Mrs.
Dewey's relatives that she had . been
wrongfully operated upon. After her
death they complained at the police sta
tion that Lash had performed the opera
tion but they Could not at that time pre
sent evidence sufficient to justify an ar-
Since then Lash has stated his case to
the public, declaring that he is entirely
innocent of the charge; that the only deal
ing he had with Mrs. Dewey was to sell
her a bottle of one of his standard prepa
rations, and that when a few days later
he found she was very sick he advised
that an experienced physician be sent for.
He says that the husband of Mrs. Dewey
has- since admitted that his wife had by
her own act brought on the condition
which resulted In her death.
It appears, however, that the authorities
will proceed with the case on the conten
tion that Lash caused the death, and that,
If he is not guilty of actual murder, he is
guilty of manslaughter.

AN ENTERPRISING AMERICAN
OFFERS TO RESCUE CAPTIVE
â¢-V ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N. W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â There is one
Â£ enterprising American who is prepared to rescue Miss Stone from the clutches of
the desperate brigands who holcLher captive. The State Department has received
a letter from this adventurer announcing that for $10,000 he will guarantee to save
Miss Stone and deliver her safely to the American legation in Constantinople. He shrewdly
figures that as $66,000 has been raised to ransom the woman, the Government or Miss Stone
herself will be $56,000 better oft by employing his services. The application has not been
granted by the department, which proposes to continue its diplomatic efforts to effect
the prisoner's liberation. â  . â  .
Another cable dispatch was received by Secretary Hay from Spencer Eddy, American
charge in Constantinople, regarding his negotiation with the brigands. Communication is slow
and Eddy is experiencing great difficulty in convincing the brigands that it is impossible to

of Lockjaw in Santa
SANTA ANA, Dec. 6.â That tetanus
may be successfully treated with the new
ly discovered serum has been demon
strated in Orange by Dr. Wood of that

PRICE OF RAISINS
MOVING UPWARD
Movement on Foot to
"Corner" Remainder
of Crop.
FRESNO, Dec. 6.â There Is a movement
on foot to corner the remainder of the
crop of raisinsâ in fact, the move is prac
tically consummated, according to the
best advices. The "approved" companies
composing the American Raisin Packing
Company, familiarly known as the "High
Five," are the principals in the deal. The
"High Five" Company has nearly all the
raisins of the California Growers' Asso
ciation in its grasp and its agents are
securing the outside crops, which have
been held by growers In the hope of high
er prices. There Is a great demand for
raisins and the price has advanced from
2V> to 3% cents per pound.
: Speculators are in the field, hoping to
realize on the turn in the market. The
packers who failed to get the approval of
the Growers' Association at the begin
ning of the season are in the scramble
for raisins, as are Eastern brokers. The
Growers' Association has sold to the
"High. Five" 2200 carloads of raisins and
the association has on hand 400 carloads
not confirmed. The "High Five" has of
fered to take the 400 carloads at the old
figureâ 2^4 centsâ but th? association is
holding them for an advance. Growers
outside of the association have sold 750
carloads, and it is estimated they hold 300
carloads unsold. The struggle is for the
possession of those 300 carloads. Rosen
berger Bros, of San Francisco, acting as
agents for the "High Five," offered 3^4
cents in Fowler yesterday and Inderrieden
& Co. of the "Low Five" offered 34 cents.
Although the American Raisin Packing
Company has shipped the 2200 carloads
East, it is strongly suspected that the
raisins have not been sold to dealers, but
are held for speculative purposes.
President Kearney's cut in prices early
In the season, to punish outside growers,
has acted in the nature of a boomerang,
as the outsiders are being paid more i for
their raisins than are the association
growers.

CUSTOMS AGENTS
SEIZE A PAYCAR
Accuses Southern Pacific
Men of Smuggling
Cigars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz... Dec. 6.â The paycar
of the Southern Paciflc Railway was held
up in Nogales yesterday by the Custom
house authorities and Paymaster C. J.
Robinson and Guard M. A. Wilson were
arrested, charged with smuggling! Mexi
can cigars across the border. The cigars
were found in the paycar and the cus
toms laws allow the Government the
privilege of confiscating any conveyance
upon which the smuggled goods are
found- ; ,
Although the cigars were of lnsignltt
cant value compared with the amount of
money the paycar contained, yet Cus
toms Collector Doane and deputies held
the car for twenty-four hours, unt'.l
proper action was taken by the Govern
ment prosecutors. The affair was a seri
ous one- for the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and it at once appealed to the Sec
retary of the Treasury, who ordered the
car released. At a late hour last night the
paycar was turned over to Paymaster
Robinson, he having obtained his own re
lease upon bond. Both Robinson and Wil
son were allowed to go upon giving bonds
to appear on January 10 before the
United States Commissioner in Nogales.
The customs officers claim that Pay
master Robinson had frequently smuggled
cigars from Mexico while he was in
Nogales paying employes of the Southern
Pacific, and upon the appearance of the
paycar yesterday Collector Doane de
tailed deputies to watch him. It Is al
leged that guards saw a Mexican enter
the car with boxes of cigars, which were
brought from the Mexican side of the
line The deputies then seized the car
and' searched it. finding twenty-three
boxes of cigars, which the Mexican had
delivered. Paymaster Robinson and
Guard Wilson were immediately placed
under arrest. ;
The Customs Collector claims to have a
strong case against the paymaster and
guard and proposes to place his evidence
before the United States Grand Jury.

STEAMER ELK
SAFE IN PORT
Last of the Nome Fleet
Has a Tempestuous
Voyage.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Dec. 1â
The long overdue steamer Elk No. 1
arrived to-day, forty-seven days from
Nome. She is the last of the Alaska fleet
of steamers to arrive. The Elk brought
five passengers, and, according to their
story, the vessel had a most eventful
voyage, with many narrow escapes from
being wrecked. On the way down the
Elk encountered an almost continual gale
and was compelled to seek shelter at
every available place.
The first of the Elk's mishaps occurred
on the night of November 3, when her
rudder was carried away. When daylight
came It was found that the craft had
drifted dangerously close to the rocky
beach and Captain Dunham determined
to run the vessel on the beach. A jury
rudder was rigged and while seeking a
favorable place the Elk struck a rock,
carrying away her condensers. She was
successfully beached, but before her rud
der and condensers could be repaired a
storm came up and the craft had to be
worked off by the use of sails. For three
days she was buffeted about in a helpless
condition.
On November 10 Kadiak was reached,
wliere the rudder and machinery were re
paired and the little craft again started
on her journey. Between Unga and Ka
dlak the severest storm was experienced
and all on board had given up hopes oJ
reaching shore. Besides having a tumultu
oua sea to contend with her safety was
endangered by ice forming from spray.
and several times all hand3 were called
to cut away ice.
The Klk reports having sighted the mall
steamer Discovery at "Wood Island on
November 14. Grave fears have been en
tertained for the safety of the Discovery.

Fruit Growers Complain
of Heavy Refriger
ation Charges.
Better Service Is^ Necessary
to- Insure Profit on
Shipments.
A decided stand was taken yesterday
by tbe Fruit Growers' Convention against
the practice of the railroad companies
confining: the refrigerator business to pri
vate parties or corporations. A practical
monopoly of this Hrfe of business now ex
ists and, according to the statements
made on the floor of the convention,' the
fruit grower is subjected to the most un
just and exorbitant charges.
The matter came up during the morn-
Ing session when the report of the perma
nent committee on transportation was
taken up for discussion. R. D. Stephens
of Sacramento, chairman of the commit
tee, and who has borne the brunt of the
light for lower rates and better service
on behalf of the fruit growers of the
State, spoke to his motion, asking "thÂ«i
adoption of the report.
After explaining in detail the work of
the committee, he said in part:
The reduction / of time is one of the mosl
important factors, because as much good can
com* from that to the fruit 'grower as from
any other thing-. We must impress upon the
companies that unless the fruit arrives in the
Eastern markets in better condition than in
the past it cannot be distributed. The Im
mense profits from refrigeration have per
mitted those interested to virtually control not
only the distribution but the values of fruit
to a greater or less degree. AH the growers
of California ask is to be placed on an equal
ity, one with the other. The tact that the past
season has been comparatively prosperous is
dangerous from the fact that we might re
main dormant and not make any protest to
the railways against renewing contracts with
the refrigerating companies who had an abso
lute monopoly of refrigeration.
The slogan raised against Mr. Earl was
that he not only had controlled refrigeration,
but that he had a freight interest in transfer
ring and selling fruit. We want the railroad
companies to put on refrigerating cars as
they are doing in Washington and Oregon-
The growers are not charged one cent for re
frigeration from those States. Their fruits
are sent to markets in competition with ours.
It would be wrong for this convention to ad
journ without taking positive action in tills
matter. The fruit growers are masters of the
situation. The companies realize that as a
result of the memorial of May 21. I therefore
move that the convention Indorse the demands
madÂ« in the transportation committee's report
objecting to the railway companies renewing
or entering into contracts with Earl or
Armour or any other line; that we are opposed
to the private ownership and control of re
frigerator car lines; that we want the rail
way companies to carry out their contracts
made with the growers as a result of the
May memorial limiting the transit of decidu
ous fruits to six days to Chicago and nine days
to New York, and that the railway companies
own their refrigerating cars as does the Great
Northern Railway.
Edwin F. Adams of Santa Cruz second
ed the motion.
W. H. Aiken of Santa Cruz, speaking
to the question of time in transit, said
it was a most important factor, it was
true, but that care in packing for East
ern- markets was also essential. He re
lated incidents of a recent visit to New
York and the methods of handling fruit
in the auction houses, saying that the j
loss to poor packers in the lots he saw
was considerable. i
"It Is nice to meet here annually," said
E. Berwick, "and pass resolutions and
throw bouquets at the railroad companies.
If they promise to deliver fruit in New
York in nine days, let them do it, but
don't let them always make the poor fruit
grower their scapegoat."
A. N. Judd of Watsonville, an exten
sive shipper of apples, told of his expe
riences gained during a recent trip
through Oregon, and explained the differ
ences in freight rates. He said in part:
I found that every point was a terminal
point, and at points where they were paying
sixty cents to Missouri River points and sev
enty-five cents farther east per hundred
pounds on apples, I found from similarly lo
cated points we were paying $1 05. Refrigerat
ing charges instead of being $33 were $10 and
117 50, and no extra charge for Icing en route.
The growers shipped 30,000 chests of strawber
ries last year from the Hood River country
and are planting trees on that section to in
crease their orchard areas from 300 to 500 per
cent. Their prunes are competing with ours
and what they lack in sweetness they make
up in size. When I told them I was from
California they chuckled at the differences
among the Santa Clara growers, and said,
"You are making a market for our prunes
right along." These people are able to ship
apples oves. two long mountain ranges cheap
er than we can from Watsonville.
The report was adopted. As two of the

MONGOLIAN ASSASSIN SLAYS
LABORER IN VIEW OF WHITES
Hired Murderer Shoots Down His Victim on Business
Street in this Broad Light of Afternoon.
IN the presence of at least half a
dozen white men Wong Get, a Chi
nese laborer, was fatally shot on
Commercial street, near Kearny, at
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, dying
a short time after receiving his wounds.
Four shots were fired at him at close
range, all of which took effect. Sergeant
Conboy, Detective Tom Gibson and Offi
cer Herlihy arrested three Chinamen on
suspicion of being implicated in the mur
der. One of them, who gave his name
as Yee Loon, was identified later by Dan
nie Love, a 14-year-old boy, who lives
at 1710 Stockton street, as the man who
fired the fatal shots. Love's story of the
shooting is as follows:
I was walking along Commercial street and
when near Kearny I saw two Chinamen fol
lowing another. When within a few feet of
the Chinese who was alone one of the men
who were following him drew a long revolver
and fired four shots at his victim. As he fell
to the sidewalk the man who did the shooting
threw the smoking revolver away and ran into
a house a few feet from wherfc his victim lay
breathing his last.
I stood in front of the murderer, hoping to
force him to run down the street, where a
number of white people were standing, but ho
brushed me aside and ran up the stairs.
I called to several police officers who had
arrived on the scene and hastily told them
of what I had seen. They quickly entered the
house into which the murderer ran, and lying
on a bed, partly undressed, they found Yee
Loon, the man who did the shooting. I am
positive that he is the murderer.
Witnessed by Whites.
At least twenty white people were
crossing ' Commercial street on Kearny
when the murder was committed. Many
of them, after the first shot was fired,
took to their heels, fearing that a gen
eral fusillade was about to .follow. As
soon as the police reached the scene the>
found the wounded. Chinaman lying in
the doorway of a house at 711 Commer
cial street. He was able to speak, but
members of the former committee are
out of the State, Chairman Cooper will
announce their successors in a few days.
N. W. Motherall of Hanford, on behalf
of the Supervisors of Kings County,-ex
tended an invitation to the convention to
meet in that city next year.
D. C. McCallum of Oroville presented
the claims of the northern citrus belt, and
John Dore of Fresno named Los Angeles.
Several of the delegates named San Fran
cisco. A vote was taken by the showing
of hands and the result was announced
as follows: Hanford 9, Los Angeles I,
Oroville 2 and San Francisco 17. As the
State' Board of Horticulture has the se
lection of the place of meeting, the result
of the vote will be sent to that body.
The chair announced the appointment
of the following committees:
Awards on fruit exhibitsâ E. Berwick, Pro
fessor HauBmann and Edward M. Ehrhorn.
Nicaragua canal-^E. Berwick, E. F. Adams
and B. N. Rowley.
H. P. Stabler in his paper, "County
Horticultural Boards and What They
Have Accomplished," which was read by
Secretary John Isaacs, said that there
were boards in twenty-nine of the coun
ties of the State, and that they were con
tinually working to exterminate fruit
pests and diseases and enforcing quaran
tine laws. . r â â â 
J. W, Nelson's paper on "The Fruit
Grower and His Work" was also read
by Secretary Isaacs. He said the fruit
industry at present brought to the State
$40,000,000 annually, and soon would reach
$100,000,000.
An interesting history of fruit pests,
parasites and insect life was read by Ed
ward M. Ehrhorh. The paper showed a
deep research and close acquaintance with
the habits, habitats and enemies of the
bane of the orchardist. â¢
Professor C. W. Woodworth of the de
partment of entomology of the Univer
eity of California gave a history of the
white flies of. California, illustrating his.
lecture by a series of charts. Â»

E. Jaffa of the University of California,
wae an able argument for the establish
ment of a State bureau of inspection
which would have power to examine all
samples submitted to it, declare the re
sult and publish the name of the offend
ing manufacturer. He said such a plan
had been followed in many Eastern States
and was productive of much good. He
devoted considerable attention to the use
of preservatives and explained their ac
tion on the human stomach.
Alexander Craw's paper dealt with
"What California Has Done for Agrioul
ture." He gave a history of the efforts
to exterminate insects and enforce quar
antine laws.
W. 0. Emerson closed the programme
by an entertaining essay on birds in their
relation to horticulture and agriculture.
The final business of the session was
tbe passage of votes of thanks to - the
State; Board of Horticulture for the ex
cellent programme -presented, to the press
for Its reports, to Chairman Cooper and
Vice Chairman Wickson for their fair
ness and courtesy and to B. N. Rowley,
Chairman of the > committee of ; arrange
ments, for his work.
The convention then adjourned without

could not give the name of the man who
shot him.
"He shot me from behind," said tne
dying Chinaman. "He did not give me a
chance for my life."
As soon as possible the unfortunate
Chinaman was removed to the Receiving
Hospital, where a hasty examination of
his wounds showed that he was fataiJy
wounded. . â  ~;
Two bullets had entered the back," pass
ing through the body, tiie third through
the left leg and the fourth tore away the
thumb of the right .hand. Fifteen, minutes
after being taken to the hospital Wong
Get was dead.
The, police believe that the shooting was
the outcome of the bitter feud that exist?
between the Wong ana Ohin families.
Since the two families declared:, war
against each other several of their num
ber have been murdered and as many
more have been shot and wounded.
Shooting of Little Lou.
The shooting of Little Lou and his body
guard as they were entering a gambling
house on Waverly place a few nights ago
intensified the bitterness between the two
families. Lou was a member of the.Bing
Kong Tong, but his sympathies were with
the Wong' family. -His father- was foully
murdered while standing in the doorway
of his store some years ago and as It wa3
supposed that the assassin was a .Chin
man Lou swore he would have revenge. It
is known that on many occasions he pro
tected the members of the Wong, family
against the assassins hired to slay, thorn,
and as the result a' price was. placed on
his head. Learning that they were after
him, Lou never left his home 'without his
bodyguard. ~ After he was â  shot about
twenty gun fighters wore brought from
the interior â¢ and ordered to avenge the
shooting of the noted gambler.

pital, but he expects to leave there in a
few days. He threatens to make it lively
for his enemies after he recovers.
More Trouble Expected.
In anticipation of more bloodshed, Chief
Wittman has increased his forces in
Chinatown. Orders have been issued to
the men to search every known high
binder for weapons. All suspicious char
acters are to be locked up and held pend
ing the settlement of the bloody feud.
Last night the Chinese Consul met with
a number of the prominent members of
the two families and endeavored to bring
about a reconciliation. After advising
them to peaceably settle their trouble, bui
without getting much encouragement, he
dismissed them after warning them
against further bloodshed.
Last night the. police found another boy
who was a witness to the murder. His
name is Ernest Olsen and he lives at 614
Kearny street. He was within a few feet
of Wong Get when he was shot and killed.
Olsen is positive that Yee Loon, who is
under arrest, fired the fatal shots. He
says the murderer' was accompanied by
another Chinaman who threw away a
long Colt's revolver immediately after the
last shot was fired. His revolver and the
one that was used in the assassination of
Wong Get are in the possession of the
police..
Chinese Stabbed by Roommate.
Wong Lee and Wong Bon, who live at
15 Waverley place, quarreled about 6
o'clock yesterday morning about the pay

Lee on the right ~ arm. Wong Lee was
sent to the Receiving Hospital and Wong
Bon was locked up in the City Prison and
will be charged with assault to murder.

IN SYNAGOGUES
Jews Celebrate Impres
sively the Feast of
Lights.
Special services were held at the syna
gogues yesterday, beginning the celebra
tion of the "Feast "of Lights," or the
Chanukah Festival. The feast celebrates
the victory of the Maccabees over the
Syrian Greeks.
A special choral service was held at the
Bush-street Synagogue in the afternoon.
The Rev. Cantor Salomon conducted the
musical service and was assisted by the
organ and a choir, of twelve ladies of the
congregation. The ceremony of lighting
the Chanukah lights was carried out with
impressiveness.
The Rev. Dr. Myers will deliver a ser
mon this morning at the synagogue, his
text being "Light Out of Darkness." To
morrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock a special
service will be held for children as part
of the Chanukah festival.
At Temple Emanu-El a special service
was held last night, though the ceremo
nies of the festival were not observed.
Special music was rendered by the choir,
under the direction of Cantor Stark, in
which Homer Henley, David Manlloyd,
Miss Daisy Cohn and Mrs. Kelly were
heard in solos.
The Rev. Dr. Jacob "Voorsanger
preached on liberty of worship as sym
bolized by the feast of lights. He said, in
part:
Rights with us ln this country have become
institutions and must be respected. The Declar
ation of Independence was the new revelation,
a new definition of rights, a new commentary
of liberty.
There is still a difference between toleration
and a right. I thank you for your tolerance,
but I want none of it. Tolerance means conde
scension, right stands for a very different thing.
There are but two countries â the United States
and France â where liberty of worship is recog
nized as a right. In all others it is merely a
privilege exercised by the tolerance of a state
church. It Is so in England, ln Scot
land, in Ireland, in Germany and even
in that sturdy champion of liberty, Hol
land. The difference ia constitutional â whether
the right to worship as one chooses is recog
nized or on the other hand a religion may ex
ist only by the tolerance of a state church,
however surrounded by safeguards this toler
ation may be.
. Even in the United States we do not fully
realize what liberty of worship means. "We
must learn that all religion is divine though its
interpretation may not be. We must disci
pline ourselves to the idea that religions are
Indeed Bisters. There is no greater evil in
modern times than intolerance and the church
does not exist that has not yet to teach Its
children reverence for all religions as -all com
ing from the mind of God. That, we hope, is
the degree of liberty to which the people of the
United States will become educated.

SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 6.â The conven
tion of the American Federation of Labor
disposed of much routine business to-day.
Two sessions were held. The afternoon
meeting was adjourned an hour earlier in
order that the committees which were an
nounced by President Goxnpers could or
ganize and take up the work that has
been laid out for them.
The overshadowing feature of the day
was the able address of Edward F. Mc-
Shweeney, deputy commissioner of Im
migration at the port of New YorK, on
the subject of immigration. He spoke for
more than an hour and was generously
applauded for the great amount of in
formation that he save the delegates.
During the course of the two sessions
eighty-eight resolutions were presented
and referred to committees. They cover
nearly every variety of subject that af
fects workmen. One of them contained a
denunciation of "Wu Ting Fang, the Chi
nese Minister, for an alleged derogatory
remark against the American people, and
another also contained "the sincere
and hearty thanks of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor" for President
Roosevelt for the position he took on the
subject of Chinese exclusion. â 
The committee on resolutions made an
other report on contested seats at the
afternoon session and their recommenda
tions were accepted except in. one in*
stance. Among the more Important reso
lutions presented at the afternoon sessions
were these:
Denouncing Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Min
ister, for having made the alleged remark that
when the American people "are biased they
are beyond argument and reason doea not ap
peal to them."
Asking workmen to unite for independent po
litical action in a party having for lta avowed
object the overthrow of thÂ« capitalistic system
of production and distribution and the estab

as to exclude Chinese, Japanese, Malays ap<t
all people of Asiatic extraction and to prevent
the use of the American Pacific island posses
sions as a bridge over which excluded races

POSTUM CESEAL.
HIGH ALTITUDES.
Tood Cannot Be Boiled as Quickly as
in Low.
The curious experiences people have
with coffee drinking are worth pondering
over if any one is ailing and does not know
the exact reason thereof.
Coffee la a secretive worker, and
through the nervous system affects differ-
ent parts of the body In different people.
A youns married woman, Mrs. T. I*
Blackmon, Oswego, Montana, had a con-
clusive experience in the effects of coffee
on her eyes. She says, "I have used coffee
pince a. child, but a short time ago rny
eyes began to grow weak, and the least
exertion, such as reading or sewing, would
cause shooting pains and wavy lines of
light, bo that I could see but little else for
minutes at a. time.
"This alarmed me and I earnestly sought
the cause of the trouble. Some one told
me *hat coffee sometimes affected the
eyes. I at once decided to quit It and see if
I would be benefited, but I must have
t omethlngr to take the place of coffee, for
I wanted to modify, as much as possible,
the sacrifice of giving it up.
"So I decided to try Postum for myself.
When it came I made it strictly according
to directions and was wonderfully sur-
prised and pleased with it- Husband says
that my Postum is very different. Indeed,
from that he once drank at a friend's ta-
ble.
"I frankly own that I like Postum better
than I ever Uked coffee. It has a rich body
to it that coffee lacks. I boil it longer than
twenty minutes and it improves it. Per-
haps it requires longer boiling in the high
eltitudesi I think it does.
"For three months now I have been
tising Postum and have been wonderfully
benefited. My eyes no longer pain me, and
are as strong as they ever were. My com-
plexipn, instead of being sallow as former-
ly, is clear and rosy. I know to a certain-
ty that my improvement has been caused
by leaving off coffee and using Postum,
for that is absolutely the only change I
have made, and I have taken no medicine.
"A Mr. Randall, a friend of ours,- has
obtained relief from his stomach trouble
and headaches by leaving off coffee and
taking Postum. .We think we know eoroe-
thlng of the facts about coffee and about
Postum."

KERSHOW WILL CONTEST
DRAGS ALONG IN COURT
Attorneys Bix and Xowalsky Vary
Monotony by Indulging in
Numerous Spats.
Outside of the occasional spats between
Attorneys Kowalsky and Rix there was
little to enliven the hearing of the Ker
show will contest case yesterday. J.-Mor
gan Smith was on the witness stand all
afternoon. Despite the severe cross-ex
amination to which he was subjected by
Attorney Rix, he held his own and stuck
closely to the story he told Wednesday
of the writing of the will and the attend
ing circumstances.
Attorney Rix sought to elicit from the
witness an answer regarding the time
the various talks Smith had with Ker
show were held, but failed. Smith's an
swers, though given in a hesitating man
ner, confirmed his previous statements, j
Attorney Rix also closely examined the
witness about the numerous Interviews
he had had with Attorney Kowalsky con
cerning the will, but did not succeed in
getting the information he evidently ex
pected. He also examined Smith about
his discussions with Meadows, the second
witness to the will, but was unable to
shake Smith. . â 
The case will go on again to-day.

MAYOR INVESTIGATES
SWEEPING OF STREETS
Private Detective Reports That Gray
Brothers Are Not Complying
With, Specifications.
Gray Bros., who have the contract
for sweeping the streets In the down
town districts, are under Investigation
again by Mayor Phelan. His -; Honor
has had a private emissary quietly
watching the manner in which the
streets have been swept by the firm, and
he has reported that the specifications
have not been lived up to. â¢'â¢
The Mayor's detective reports that piles
of dirt have been frequently permitted
to remain on the streets over night, and
that certain blocks on Market and Val
encia streets were not swept at all or
very Imperfectly. So startling */ere the
findings of the investigator that the
Mayor referred his report to the Board
of Works, which directed Chief Heath of
the Bureau of Streets to report on the
matter. - â¢
The Mayor was so displeased at the
faulty manner in which Gray Bros.- were
reported to have swept the streets that
he threatened to decline to approve the
sweeping bills for December unless t.iey
were swept better than they were in No
vember. Chief Heath's report was trans
mitted to the Mayor yesterday, and' does
not bear out the one filed by the private
detective. The Mayor has reserved his
decision. - . , '

where such results followed. There were
no leaks in the San Rafael boilers.
Mates and Deckhands Testify.
Then came the testimony of the mates
and deckhands. Charles Jansen, second
â¢mate of the San Rafael, heard the fog
signals two points on his starboard bow,
then two whistles, followed by three from
the San Rafael, which were answered by
three from the Sausalito. The first fog.
blast of the Sausalito sounded far away_.
He reported to the pilot house.
John Nelson, deckhand on the San Ra
fael, had a similar story of whistles, only
his was supplemented with life saving.
He warned passengers, lowered boats,
took charge of one and acted the part of
human fisherman. He saw the men in the
boats picking up people. Captain McKen
zie, according to Nelson's testimony, cried
out to the Sausalito: "For God's sake,
give us a line."
Assistant Engineer Martin Christensen
of the San Rafael, Second Mate John Pe
tersen of the Sausalito and Joe Freitess,
a deckhand on the Sausalito, testified in
turn. Freitess was rather '.forgetful about
whistles, but said he helped ladles and
men into the ferryboat.
Henry C. Martin has sent a letter to the
inspectors saying he has good testimony.
The inspectors will treat his letter as
anonymous unless he appears. An ad
journment was taken until Tuesday after
noon.

LYNCH RELIES
ON DEMOCRATS
President Evidently Is
! Posted Concerning
the Fight.
Reason Why ,the Revenue
Collector Provokes
'Party Strife.
-The politicians -were somewhat sur
prised when they. read the news that the
President had "advised Senators Perkins
and Bard to .'settle the controversy con
cerning- the internal Revenue Colector
ship. It seems that President Roosevelt
is pretty well informed touching affairs
in California. No doubt he has made
close inquiry to' ascertain why one of the
Federal officeholders in this State is so
unpopular that-his .retention -is resisted
by many leading public men. Other citi
zens holding office under* the National ad
ministration manage to get along without
provoking public indignation. The Col
lector of the . Port, the Surveyor, the
Naval Officer, the United States Mar
shal, the officers of the Land Department,
the Postmaster, the* Superintendent of
the Mint, the Shipping Commissioner, the
Appraiser, the United States District At
torney, and others, do not by their con
duct excite a spirit of hostility. They in
terest themselves in political affairs and
support the candidates respectively of
their choice. Perhaps some favored Bard
for -Senator and others preferred Barnes
or Burns. -; No one â¢ challenged their right
to express judgment as to the merit and
fitness of candidates. If the Collector of
Internal ' Revenue . had followed the ex
ample of other federal officeholders there
would not be a popular protest against his
retention in office. He started off wrong
by recognizing the Southern Pacific Rail
way corporation as the Government, and
sought, the attorney of the . corporation
for advice in affairs political. When' he
was ordered to fight Republican candi
dates and support Democratic nominees
for the Legislature he obeyed orders. He
interfered in Democratic as well as Re
publican â  faction â¢ controversies. The
leading .Republican journals in every Con
gressional district of the State
would like to see a good, square,
sensible ; man appointed to ; succeed
Lynch. The only newspaper support
Lynch receives is from the Democratic
press,, for favors extended to Democrats,
and his chief reliance is that support. So
long as. he remains in office and takes po
litical orders from Herrin there will be
discontent and factional strife. The Presi
dent may wisely determine to take af
fairs in his own hands and remove tho
cause of the strife.
Can Be Removed Any Time.
It happens, fortunately, that there is no
fixed term for the office of Collector of
Revenue, The President can. make the
change at his pleasure.. Lynch has al
ready served more than four years. In
his fight to hold on Lynch relies on the
support of the yellow press and the pull
of the Southern Pacific corporation. i
The peculiar attitude of Senator Perkins
creates a surmise that the Senator has
been promised railroad help in his cam
paign for re-election to the Senate. It is
a known fact that Perkins did agree to
join in recommending to the President
any worthy man that his colleague should
recommend for the Revenue Collector
ship. Senator Perkins will not deny to
the President that he readily consented
to join in a recommendation of Dr. Rowell
for that office.
The new apportionment of Congression
al districts in California takes effect on
the first of next month. Two strong Re
publican Assembly districts â the Fortieth
and Forty-first â which added largely to
the party majority in the Fifth Congres
sional District, will henceforth be em
braced within, the boundaries of the
Fourth Congressional District. It fs said
that Julius Kahn's friends at Sacramento
were active in bringing about this trans
fer of Republican strength from the Fifth
to the Fourth Congressional District. Â»>
The Fifth District, represented by Eu
gene F. Loud, is regarded as safe for the
Republicans, notwithstanding the loss of
the two Assembly districts mentioned.
The safety of the Fourth for Mr. Kahn
may depend somewhat on his record in
the present session of Congress.
Districts Are Established.
Under the new apportionment the Con
gressional districts are established as fol
lows:
First Districtâ Del Norte, Humboldt, Siski
you. Trinity, Tehama, Shasta, Modoc, Lessen,
Plumas, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado,
Amador, Calaveras, Alpine, Mono, Maripoga
and Tuolumne.
Second District â ilendoclno, Glenn, Colusa,
Butte, Sutter. Yuba, Sacramento. Yolo. Lake,
Napa, Sonoma and Marin.
Third Districtâ Alameda, Contra Costa and
Bola.no.
Fourth Districtâ A portion of San Francisco.
Fifth Districtâ A portion of San Francisco
and the counties of San Mateo and Santa Clara.
Sixth Districtâ Santa Cruz, Monterey, San*
Benito, Fresno, Kingrs, Madera, Merced, Stan
islaus and San Joaquln. .
Seventh Districtâ Los Angeles.
Eighth Districtâ San Luis Obispo, Santa Bar
bara, Ventura, Kern, Tulare, Inyo, San Ber
nardino, Orange, Riverside and San Diego.
Frank L. Coombs, who represents the
First District at present, will be in tho
newly created Second District His
chances for renomination will depend
largely on the record he makes in Wash
inton this winter. y â *Â«Â»
There is no scarcity of candidates in tho
newly created Eighth District. State Sena
tor S. C. Smith appears to have the lead in
the northern or upper end of the district.
If the active contest among the southern
aspirants continues Mr. Smith will likely
capture the prize.
George C. Perkins, who is a candidate
for re-election to the United States Sen
ate, and Henry T. Gage, who desires an
other term as Governor, hardly speak
when they meet. The Governor snubbed
the Senator at the San Pedro celebration,
and is therefore held mainly responsible
for the rupture. Nobody knows to a cer
tainty what the Governor's provocation
was, but something caused him to ignore
the Senator. At that time it was surmised
that Senator Perkins and U. S, Grant were
in league against Gage, but subsequent
events have caused the Impression that
Grant has lost faith in the senior Senator.
There are no signs at present that Gage is
mixing in the Senatorial contest, and Per
kins is too cunning to commit himself for
or against anybody for Governor. Perkins
is for himself first for Senator, but it is
no secret that his second choice is General
W. H. L. Barnes.

STAGE REALISM
AT THE CENTRAL
Actor Hallett Thompson
Burned by Premature
Explosion.
Hallett Thompson, leading- man of the
Central Theater, was severely burned
about the face last night by a premature
explosion. His eyesight may be affected
and he may not be a.ble to appear on the
stage again for some time. The accident
occurred during the fire scene of "The
Streets of New York," now being played
at the theater. To make the scene real
istic a barrel containing black powder is
exploded. Through some oversight or
carelessness of the stage hands the pow
der was ignited when Tnompgon was di
rectly over It. The audience waa startled
to see him jump about the stage in pain
and marveled as the curtain was low
ered.
As "Badger" In the play it is the duty
of Thompson to climb a ladder and enter
a burning building and secure a certificate
of deposit that enriches the muchly
abused heroine. In thei performance,
Thompson climbs Into the building, gets
the paper and reaches the ground in safe
ty before the barrel of powder stored in
the building: Is set off. This plan haa
been followed with success until last
evening,. Thompson was in the act of
climbing the ladder when the explosion
occurred and instantly he was wrapped in
a sheet of flame. He was forced to jump
to the stage and he staggered for a mo
ment before hia blackened face gave the
audience an indication that he was the
victim of an accident.
Thompson was taken to his dressing
room and a physician called to attend
him. His eyebrows and lashes were badly
burned and a portion of his hair waa
singed. He managed to go on in the last
act, however, but the scene was necessar
ily cut short as he was in no condition to
continue the performance.
The Central Theater management
claims that Thompson is not badly in
jured and states he 'will be able to con
tinue his work.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market
KEW YORK. Dec. 6.-Fears of money strin
gency gained the upper hand in the stock
"rcrt"* to-day and precipitated active selling
throughout the list. The bears were active
Â«nd energetic in taking the market away at
each recurrence of elgns of selling, and their
buyirg to cover at frequent Intervals caused
many irregular rallies and checks to the de
cline. The demand quickly fell away on these
rallies and the activity in the market was
only renewed when prices began to give way
again. The apparent running out of the re
cent speculative movement In Manhattan and
the consequent realizing by the longs was a
feature of the market. The stock made an
effective rallying point for the bears in their
aggressive onslaueht on the market. In the
late dealings the stock fell to 135%, represent
1ns an extreme decline of 1%. At the same
time Amalgamated Copper, which had fluc
tuated rather eluggishly but heavily all day,
tj k a new downward plungs to 68%, compared
â¢with its previous low record of 71%. This un
settled the -whole market and made the clos
ing active and easy, but with the selling press
ure much less acute in the general list than
In the stocks named. The deposit at the sub
treasury lor transfer to the Interior of $1,000 000
completed the fright over the money prosnt-ct
which had been gathering lorce all day. with
the contemplation of the preliminary figures
of tie week's currency movement. It appeared
from these that the banks had gained on the
Â« *Â£5?2L â¢ OTem Â« n t by express more than
tUlW.000 up to Thursday night, thus seeming
to offset that tar the week's loss to the sub
treasury, which footed up last night $7,115,000
Â« f^^ week^ B los * to the s Â«b-treasury nearly
fi.CK'0,000 represents deposits of legal tender* to
retire circulation and withdraw Government
bonCs. These bonds have not been offered for
redemption and there is lacking this offset to
the decrease in the circulation. The payment
for the $2,000,000 gold exported is also included
in the sub-treasury operations. New York ex
change at Chicago, which fell to 50c discount
at one time yesterday, stiffened to 30c discount
to-day, as a result of the currency shipment
These unexpected new demands upon the local
money supply were reflected in calling of leans
and marking up of money rates. Banks
marked up their call loans rate over the coun
ter to 5 per cent and exercised stricter dis
crimination as to Industrial collateral. The
easier tone of the foreign exchange, market
â¢was lost sight of in this new development, al
though it promised relief from the further
gold exports threatened next week. A rise in
the New York money rate will help to prevent
eold exports, but not to the relief of the specu
lative borrowers on call. The few stocks which
rra4e a show of strength during the morning
ruccumbed to the weakness. . .
Lotnes of 1 to 3 points were made by the
majority of the prominent active stocks. Gen
eral Electric, after rising to 2S9S4,. broke to
2S014 Â°n the declaration of only the regular
quarterly dividend an.l then fluctuated wiMly
above the lowest.
Bonds were easier in sympathy with stocks.
Total sales, par value, $3,9S9,C0O.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

Bradstreet's on Trade.
*â â â : : _4
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.-Bradstreet's to-morrow
will say:
Retail distribution, stimulated -. by cold
weather and, holiday Influences, -has been very
large and has reflected in a decidedly good re
asserting demand from jobbers. Holiday trade,
in fact, promises to be of unprecedented vol
ume, with demand for better class of goods.
In the great industries, such as! iron, coal,
lumber, , the textiles, boots and shoes and the
various kindred and subsidiary branches, ac
tivity is widespread. , . â
The' trade in good staples and metals is the
basis for the apparent resumption in the ad
vance of the general level l>f prices noted for
November. Iron and steel are stronger at the
highest prices of the year. Inability to obtain
supplies , is complained all the way â  from the
furnace to the finished products. The switch
men's strike affects Pittsburg and further ag
gravates the car shortage trouble. Some mills
are closing for want of steel and some fur
naces for want of fuel. Merchant furnaces
are reported.-, running onljw half their capacity.
Steel is practically unobtainable for prompt
delivery. , Wire and nails alone are weaker in
price, on competition. Plates are stronger and
structural mills are crowded with orders. Bar
steel is scarce at Chicago. .Rail, buyers arÂ»
numerous, but sellers are â¢ indifferent. Foun
dries have booked orders months ahead. Orders
for railroad cars are very heavy.
The original impetus for wheat has this week
been aided by the widening out of speculation
owing to buying being a feature, aided by*the
smaller run of receipts at the Northwest. Tha
highest price paid for - seventeen months has
been reached in the face of the largest gain- in
stocks, both- here and abroad, reported in any
month- for years. Wheat in- the United > States
and Canada increased 21,000,000 bushels in No
vember, an increase nearly- five times the gain
shown a year ago. Corn and oats are higher
than at any -time since- 1891. Hog " products
and provisions generally ' are In better' specu
lative demand and statistically â¢ the position
has many points of strength.
Wheat, including flour, ' exports for the week
aggregate 4,604,846 bushels, against 5,117,478
bushels last week, and 3,432,159 bushels in. this
week last year. Wheat exports, July 1 to date
(twenty-three weeks), aggregate 132,423,906
bushels, . against 80,175,178 bushels last season.
. After a slight breathing spell In October,
prices, influenced chiefly, by the cereals, pro
visions and metals, apparently resumed their
upward course in - November, and ' the - index
number, on December 1. as reported by Brad-
Etroet's, is S5.773, a gain of seven-tenths of one
per. cent over the' index number of November
1 and of 2 per cent over the low water mark
of June 1/ but a- decline of 8, per cent from
the hich water mark of February, 1900. In
all. six out of thirteen classes of products ad
vanced during November, they beins bread
stuffs, wovl3ions, livestock, the metals, coa)
and coke and miscellaneous products, forty-five
products advancing, twenty-three declining and
thirty-five remaining unchanged as a result of
operations during that month. Compared with
a year ago, fifty-one products are higher,
forty-two lower and thirteen remain un
changed. V
Business failures in the United States for
the week number 236, against 189 last week, 283
in this week a year ago, 220 in 1S99, 237 in 1S0S
and 292 in 1397. Canadian failures number 23.
against 26 last week and 27 a year ago.
Dun's Review of Trade.
* : â¢!â 
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will to-morrow say:
- Current trade is of ample dimensions, but
traffic congestion grows worse and laboi con
troversies add to the embarrassment of ship
pers, j If consignments of fa.ncy goods for the
holiday- trade are delayed much longer there
Will be serious loss. Prices of commodities
tend upward.
Activity and strength are conspicuous in the
markets for domestic wool. Coates Bros.' cir
cular makes the average of one hundred grades
17.51 cents, which is the -best price recorded
since May. Concessions are not ' secured â¢ by
purchasers, but on the other hand, holders grow
more â¢ confident. Des=aite recent phenomenal
sales at . Boston, . there is steady, buying. and
stocks ;do not accumulate, although arrivals
are liberal.. Makers of heavyweight woolens
received good duplicate orders, while contracts
for spring lines come forward freely. Foot
wear factories are busy on spring goods, many
having contracts for spring lines. â  Chicago
shows a further decline, but imported dry
hides are well sustained. Staple products con-,
tinue advancing, corn making a most sensa
tional gain. Extraordinarily high prices for
corn tempted many traders to sell future con
tracts in expectation of a sharp reaction, but
a further violent rise* to the hiKhest ..price for
many; years compelled covering at a. severe
loss. This grain is not covered ; by precedent,
the smaller exports for many years failing to
produce any. effect. Shipment from Atlantic
ports reached the lowest point since 1894. *
Wheat was also sharply advanced to the best
price of the season, largely through sympathy
with corn.- for wheat was freely substituted.
Poor weather for new crops of wheat and de
mand were also strengthening features, : be
sides . resorts from all parts of the United
States amounting to 4,815,000 bushels for the
week against 3,255,211 a year ago. ; â ..'
New York Grain and Produce:
;NEW YORK, Dec. 6.â The regular session of
Brain markets did not provide much excitement
t'p-day.i but curb trading, after the regular
close, was one of the heaviest In months and
revealed a shortage among pit. traders that ex
ceeded all, calculations. So vigorous was this
demand from scalpers who had been pounding
the market all day In a vain effort to for<:e li
quidation by outsiders that May wheat Jumped
from 85c to 85%c, representing - the highest
point on the crop. Corn sold up sharply, but
failed to reach Its previous high point of 72%c
for May. â  . â

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 6.â Wheat started In with a
small demand, which. was taken to indicate a
continuation of the bull movement. ! This
brought good advances at the opening, but
profit-taking, dull trade, poor cables and out-
Side declines brought a sharp slump. Late In
the day strength at St. Louis and buying
orders from the Southwest started general buy
ing again. , During the last twenty minutes of
trade prices jumped forward and backward %c.
Though all the advances were not held, the
close of the pit was very firm. December
opened %c up ati76Vic, sagged oft! to 76%c, re
acted and closed firm, %@%c up at 75%@76c.
May opened %c to %o up at 80c to 80%c, sold
to SC'Uc, fell to 79%c, reacted and closed firm,
%@%c up at 79%@80c.
Corn was moderately steady, trading being
narrow and comparatively limited to local in
terests. There was a lack of outside support,
sucn as has been present for several days, and
fears of an increased country movement and
slackened spring demand induced many hold
ers to realize in anticipation of a setback from
top prices. Toward the close the wheat
strength helped ' materially, but the closing
figures were only steady. December unchanged
at 64^4 c and May a shade higher at 67%c.
Oats had a comparatively small trade over a
narrow range, with almost featureless opera

WHEATâ The foreign markets 1 were barely
steady, and Liverpool futures declined.
Chicago opened firm and advanced from 79%c
to SOVic, but fell back again to 79%c. Wires
to M. Blum & Co. said: "There was heavy
general buying at the opening, and the other
markets were relatively stronger than Chicago,
but heavy selling by brokers, presumably for
local account, caused a quick break. St. Louis
and New York were unchanged, but the North
west was %c off. The professional bull ele
ment seemed determined to take profits, figur
ing that the market was overbought. This,
supplemented by short selling, gave the mar
ket a scf t appearance. Later on free buying
by St. Louis caused a sharp rally."
Wires to Bolton, de Ruyter ' & Co. said:
"The public have taken hold with confidence,
and are not i to be shaken off by slight reac
tions. The country buying continued enor
mous, and the professional trade cut no figure.
Outsiders and Wall street were the best buy
ers, and the purchases of the latter checked the
decline. A big line was reported worked for
export. Realizing was liberal, â¢ however, there
were a lot of selling orders In at 80c, and
Omaha and the Southwest were heavy sellers.
There seemed to be plenty of wheat for sale."
This market fell oft slightly on calL with a

The, latest thing In this market Is the tem

ness and activity, and are rapidly moving out
of first hands. Prices are very strong, but
not yet actually higher. Local dealers say
that general trade in Dried Fruits is now bet

STOCK MARKET.
As was expected the publication of the pro
posed entrance Into the light and power field
of the California Gas and Electric Company
with a capitalization of $30,000,000 affected the
stock of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company, and on the morning session of thÂ«
Bond Exchange the quotation dropped from
$43 37% to $41 50. subsequently recovering to
$42 50, with' fairly active sales. There were no
other fluctuations worthy of comment. Bank
of California stock sold at $412.
The only new feature in oil stocks was Â»
partial recovery in Hanford. which sold down
to $S9 on Thursday, to $31 bid. Rumors of a
possible suspension of the dividends, although
unconfirmed, led to the break in this stock.
In the afternoon Gas and Electric recovered
to $42 75@43 12%. Market Street Railroad was
higher at $33 50 and Alaska Packers' at $156.
Paauhau Sugar was lower at $10 25. Hanford

ADVERTISEMENTS.
WHAT CAUSES DEAFNESS.
] 2 he Principal Cause Is Curable but
Generally Overlooked.
.â* Many things may cause deafness, and
r Very often it is difficult to trace a cause.
people inherit deafness. Acute dls-
I eases like scarlet fever sometimes cause
deafness. But by far the most common
cause of loss of hearing is catarrh of the
head and throat.
A prominent specialist on ear troubles
gives as his opinion that nine out of ten
cases of deafness are traced to throat
trouble; this is probably overstated, but
it is certainly true that more than half cf
all cases of poor hearing were caused by
catarrh.
The catarrhal secretion in the nose and
â¢idjroat finds its way Into the eustaciii.-m
if.e and by clogging it up very soon *f-
ffcts the hearing and the hardening of
tne secretion makes the loss of hearing
permanent, uniess the catarrh whica
â m caused the trouble is cured.
Those who are hard of hearing may
think this a little far fetched, but any
I one at all observant must have notictd
how a hard cold in the head will affect
the hearing and that catarrh If long .ne-
glected will certainly impair the sense cf
hearing and ultimately cause deafness.
If the nose and throat are kept clear
and free from the unhealthy secretions of
catarrh, the hearing will at once greatly
improve and anyone suffering from deaf-
ness and catarrh can satisfy themselves
on this point by using a fifty-cent box of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a new catarrh
cure, which in the past year has won tlis
approval of thousands of catarrh suffer-
ers, as well as â¢ physicians, because it is
in convenient form to use, contains no
cocaine or opiate and Is as safe and picas â¢â¢
ent for children as for their elders.
Stuart's Catarrh . Tablets is a whole-
tome combination of Blood Root, Guala-
col, Kucalyptol and similar antiseptics,
and they c'ure catarrh and catarrhal deaf-
ness by action upon the blood and
mucous membrane of the nose and throat.
As one physician aptly expresses it:
"You do not have to draw upon the im.ig-
Ir.ation to discover whether you are get-
benefit frcm Stuart's Catarrh TÂ«ib-
}*2f; improvement and relief . are appar-
Â«tj from the first tablet taken."
Ail druggists sell and recommend them.
They cost but fifty cents for full sizcÂ«d
package and any catarrh sufferer who
has wasted time and money on sprays,
1 calves and powders, will appreciate to the
full the merit of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
let*.
BOARD PUNISHES
SALOONKEEPERS
Men Who Kept Open on
Election Day Must
CJose for Week.

The Board of Police Commissioners took
steps at Its meeting last night to punish

MOLE'S MURDER MAY NOT
BE FIXED ON DOLAN
Hugh B. B. Chapman, the Principal
Witness, Goes Back on the
Prosecution. i
The preliminary examination of John M.
Dolan on the charge of murdering Albert
A. Mole In front of 239 O'Farrell street on
the morning of November 22 was con
cluded before Judge Conlan yesterday. At-'
torney Bert Schlesinger, on behalf. of the
defendant, made a motion to dismiss the
case, but the Judge decided to reserve his
judgment till Monday. ' . ,
The testimony given by Hugh B. B.
Chapman, the murdered man's friend; who
swore to the complaint, was entirely dif
ferent from that given by him at the Cor
oner's Inquest. There he testified that
there was a fight between Dolan and Mole
and that he saw Mole fall to the ground
and Dolan run away. He made the same
statement to Detectve T. B. Gibson. Yes
terday he said he saw no fight, but that
Dolan dashed across the street as Mole
fell. â  -. : . . ~
The other witnesses examined were
Clara Wallace, who lived with Dolan; H.
C. Hudson, Dolan's partner; and Detec
tives Hamlll and Gibson. Their evidence
was not material, however. Gibson de
tailed the conversation he had with Chap
man when the latter stated that Dolan
and Mole had a fight and as Mole fell Do
lan dashed acroBs the street.- As it was
only hearsay it was stricken out of the
record. "

OIL COMPANIES
IN A COMBINE
Consolidation of Large
Firms Announced in
â¢ Texas.
Capital Amounting to Many
Millions Involved in
a Deal.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN. Tex.. Dec. 6.â T. B. Long, an
oil producer of Beaumont, who is also
extensively interested In the Pennsyl
vania oil fields, was here to-day, and is
authority for the statement that the J.
M. Guffey Petroleum Company, an Eng
lish corporation which has for many
years been a strong competitor of the
Standard Oil Company in the oil trade of
Europe and Asia, was combined with the
Shell Transportation and Trading Com
pany. Long says that it the opinion
among oil men that it is more of a con
solidation of the interests of the two
companies than an outright purchase.
The J. M. Guffey Petroleum Company
has a capital stock of $30,000,000 and the
capital of the Shell Transportation and
Trading Company is $10,000,000. A few
months ago the J. M. Guffey Petroleum
Company entered Into a contract â with the
Shell Transportation and Trading Com
pany for the transportation and sale of
its oil in European and Asiatic countries
and a number of vessels of the Shell
Transportation and Trading Company
have already -taken cargoes of Beaumont
oil to foreign markets. '.
Among the incorporators of the J. M.
Guffey Company are Colonel J. M. Guffey,
John H. Gafey and H. C. Frick, of Pitts
burg, Pa. It owns a number of produc
ing- wells and other -very valuable prop
erty in the Beaumont oil fields.
UNDEB SHEBIPF BETTJBNING ,
WITH HAYES ALEXANDER
Han Wanted in Ventura County
"Waives Extradition From Ari
zona Territory.
PHOENI?, Ariz., Dec. 6.â Under Sheriff
Snodgrass of Ventura, Cal., left here to
night with Hayes Alexander, wanted
there for a variety of crimes. Alexander
consented to go without extradition pa
pers, knowing he would eventually have
to go anyway.
Alexander's alleged criminal record Is
a long one for a man of his age. This
is not the first time Snodgrass has trav
eled with him. "When Alexander was 13
years old the officer took Wm to the re
form school at Whittier. He had beec
convicted of larceny. Soon after his re
turn to Ventura he committed a forgery
and was convicted and sentenced to three
years in San Quentln. Snodgrass accom
panied him on that journey. After doing
time Alexander left California and came
to Arizona. Nearly two years ago he
committed a larceny in this county and
disappeared. He â went back to Ventura
and two months ago committed a series
of crimes, beginning â¢with the robbery of
a friend of property valued at $100. He
also raised money by means of three
forged checks. The Ventura authorities
suspected that he would return to this
county, as his mother and two brothers
had removed hither some time before.
Local officers -were notified and Alexander
was arrested last week under the name
of H. H. Martin.

sational Testimony in the San
Jose Trial.
SAN JOSE. Dec. 6.â Sensations are de
veloping in the second trial of Nolberto
Coronado, now, in progress before Judge
Lorigan, for the murder of Frank Norona
at Guadalupe on July 26. Mrs. Adelina
Patron, who has been housekeeper for
Nicholas Coronado, the brother of the de
fendant, swore to-day that Coronado had
confessed the murder to her. She testi
fied that a few days after the crime she,
in company with the wife of the accused,
visited Coronado In the jail. In the pres
ence of Mrs. Coronado she asked the pris
oner: .
"Why did you do It?"
To this Coronado replied, "I did It to
accomplish good."
When . asked why he did not hide the
gun, Coronado said he never thought he
would be suspected.
Mrs. Patron also testified that on the
occasion of the visit to the jail Coronado
had told her and his wife that at the
time the Sheriff was searching his cabin
he bad gone to the door and tossed a $20
piece he had taken from Norona's body
into some brush near by. He told them
where they could find It. A few days later
the witness and Mrs. Coronado .went to
the place near the cabin and got the coin.

Drastic Punishment for Craven

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.â Chief of Po

Woman's Christian Temperance Union of
the causes leading to vice In Los An
geles at their meeting held to-day.
"That alcohol," said the Chief, "Is the
root of all evil my experience in police
work leads me to believe. The elimina
tion of the liquor traffic would result In
the reduction of the- police force of Loa
Angeles by one-half. I find that most of
our criminals come from broken families.
"What is to be done with a man who
desert3 his wife and children In this fash
ion? The offense la severe, and I would
provide a severe penalty. There ought to
be established In every Jail of the United
States a whipping post. The craven who
deserts his family ought to . receive a
thrashing at the hands of the law. The
whipping post. I firmly believe, is the
best method of dealing with such scoun-

DECISION IS AGAINST
JONATHAN SWEIGERT
SAN JOSE, Dec. 6. â Schmoll vs. Swel
gert, one of the most important cases
ever before the courts of this county,
was decided by Judge Rhodes to-day. By
its terms Jonathan Swelgert. ex-Sherift
of Santa Clara County, must turn back
into the estate of Adam Swelgert, de
ceased, a sum approximating $68,000,
which Jonathan Swelgert claimed his
father had left as a trust fund, and
which, according to the court, the de
fendant had disposed of in part by gifts
to himself and various members of tha
family.
Adam Sweigert was a pioneer of this
county and died in 1899. His will waa ad
mitted to probate and Jonathan Sweigert,
his son. was appointed executor. His
property was bequeathed in three equal
parts to Jonathan Sweigert, Caroline
Schmoll, a daughter, and four children
of a deceased son, Adam. Upon the fil
ing of the inventory Mrs. Schmoll and
the grandchildren claimed that the exec
utor had failed to account for a larga
sum of money. Jonathan Swelgert In
sisted that this sum was a trust and that
a part of it had been given to himself
and family by the decedent. Suit against
him was commenced and the court now
decides that there was no trust and that
the gifts were made not by the decedent
but by Jonathan himself.

Indictments of Grand ,
Jury.
Former Nurss Accused of
Having Poisoned Three
Persons.
BARNSTABLE. Mass.. Dec. 6.-Mlss
Jane Toppan of Lowell stood up in the
Superior Court room late this afternoon
and heard . the Grand Jury's indictment
charging her with the murder of three
persons whom she had been engaged to
nurse back to health, but who had died
under her charge, and, according to the
indictment, by her band.
The indictments, and there are three
one' charging her with the death of Mrs.
Mary D. Gibbs, a second with the death
of A. P. Davis, both of Cataumet, and
the third with that of Mrs. Genevieve
Gordon of Chicago â alleged that the cause
was . the administration of poisonous
drugs. . â 
For ten minutes the woman stood tight
ly clutching the rail while the clerk read
the .Indictment charging her with the
murder of Mrs. Gibbs. At length Miss
Toppan's counsel spared her further
agc.ny by waiving the reading, and all
that remained was for her to plead.
Three times she was asked if she was
guilty of the murder and three times she
replied, "Not guilty."
After the woman had entered her plea
her counsel asked that the State appoint
counsel for her, and Chief Justice Mason,
who presided, took the matter under ad
visement. â¢
Miss Toppan was then led away to her
cell, where she will remain until some
time early next spring, wnen she will be
given a trial by jury.

Ing, the room being filled with illuminat
ing gas and the stopcock of the gas

SPEAKS WELL
FOR THE NEGRO
Georgia Bishop Makes a
Strong Appeal for
the Race.
Education in Industrial Lines,
He Says, Is Needed
Most.
ROCHESTER, N. Y., Dec. 6.â The third
day's session of the Episcopal Missionary
Conference opened with holy communion
In the churches. This was followed by a
conference on recognized agencies in sSt-
Luke'a Church. The Right Rev. George
W. Peterkln gave an interesting address
on "The Clergy," and was followed by
John W. Wood on "The Laity." Tne
Kev. Dr. H. L. Dunning was the third
speaker of the morning, taking the sub
ject of 'The Children."
This afternoon the subject, "What We
Are Doing for the Negro," was treated
by Bishop C. Kinlock Nelson of Georgia.
He made a strong appeal for the educa
tion of the colored race along industrial
lines. He declared emphatically that
there is no decent, capable negro in the
South to-day who need be witnout work
lor twelve hours. Continuing, he said:
"The Southern people as a class have
no sympathy with the outrages that are
perpetrated. The best of them are op
posed to the disregard for law and order
tfeat is sometimes manifested, and I wish
to warn you against believing all you
read about the, enormities that are chron
icled. Too often these are the products
of the imagination of sensational news
papers and have no foundation in fact!"
In closing Dr. Nelson said that the con
tributions that have been made for the
prosecution of work among the negroes
in the South had been deplorably inade
quate.
Bishop Kinsolving of Brazil said that
when he went to that republic he found
himself in a land of spiritual death,
among 18,000.000 people, four-fifths of
whom were utterly illiterate, and that
practically the same conditions prevail
to-day.
The growth of our work in Brazil,
however," said Dr. Kinsolving. "and the
growth of our church and the liberality
pf the native Christiana have no parallel
In history. '
IROQUOIS CLUB MUST BE
ABSOLUTELY DEMOCRATIC
Faithful Members Are Required to
Vote Straight Party Tickets in
All Elections.
The Iroquois Club held a lengthy meet
ing last night at its headquarters in
Pythian Castle building.
The principal business of the 1 evening
wa3 the proposed amendment to the pre
amble of the club's constitution, to strike
out the word "municipal" in the clause
which pledges the members to support
Democratic principles in "national, State
and municipal elections." The supporters
of the proposed amendment argued that
it was impossible to force members to
vote a straight party ticket in municipal
elections, while the opponents of the
measure claimed that to allow the club
members to vote as they pleased in local
affairs would result in the destruction of
the Jeffersonian party. The amendment
was lost, as it failed to secure the requis
ite two-thirds' vote.
The committee on public utilities of the
club presented a report suggesting that
the Democratic clubs, the labor organiza
tions and the Improvement clubs each
have six members added to the body. The
majority of the members present opposed
selection -by the committee of the repre
sentatives from the bodies named and the
matter was referred back to the spec'al
committee for another report.
The . following were placed in nomina
tion for election as officers for the ensu
ing year: President. J. B. Keenan; vice
president, J. C. Gorman; first vice presi
dent, W. H. Kline; recording secretary,
E. R, Zion; corresponding secretary, H.
L>. Beanfield; financial secretary, A. G
Pratt; treasurer, W. A. Asmussen.
For trustees, seven to be electedâ W J
Bryan. L. Metzger. Charles Glldea. A. D.
Lemon, C. J. R. Buttlar, A. Leaf, L V
Merle, W. J. Locke and C. W. Moores.

TOLD STORY OP EABLY
DAYS IN SAN FBANCISCO
Interesting lecture by Miss Lucile
Eaves Before South Park
Settlement.
Miss L.uclle Eaves, formerly teacher of
Pacific Coast history in Stanford Univer
sity, . delivered an interesting lecture on
the subject, "Early Days In San Fran
cisco," under the auspices of the South
Park Cottage Settlement at 86 South Park
last night. A large audience was in at
tendance.
The lecturer told the romantic story of
early San Franciaco in a graphic manner.
She pointed out how the pioneers, like
Caesar, - came, saw and conquered. Ily
the aid of stereopticon views the history
of the early days of the city was compre
hensively Illustrated. Views of the plaza,
the water front, historic structures, some
of which are still to be seen, together
with scenes during the vigilance periods,
served to render the lecture enjoyable as
well as instructive. The story told by
Miss Eaves began with the days of '43
and ended with a general purvey of the
city in 1856.

PAVILION SITE
FOR A LIBRARY
Supervisors' Committees
Favor Purchase at
$650,000.
The Judiciary and Public Utilities com
mittees of the Board of Supervisors held
a joint meeting yesterday and finally de
cided to report in favor of the purchase
of the Mechanics' Pavilion property as a
Bite for the Carnegie library at a cost of
Â£30,000.
This proposition, with many others, will
be voted upon by the people at a special
election to be held under the provisions of
the charter. The committees discussed
the various matters at length and made
recommendations which must meet the
approval of the board before being sub
mitted to the electors of the city and
county for their votes.
The library site matter occasioned little
discussion. A resolution approving the
site was adopted some time ago, but on Its
reference to the City Attorney that official
found flaws in it which necessitated fur
ther action. The clerk of the board was
instructed to draft a resolution in accord
ance with the City Attorney's instruc
tions. As a majority of the board was
present it goes without saying that the
resolution will be adopted. If the acquire
ment of the Pavilion site for the sum
named is satisfactory to the public the
gift of Carnegie of 5750,000 for a free libra
ry building will be realized within the
next two years.
Proposed Public Playground.
The matter of acquiring half of the
block bounded by Sixth, Seventh, Harri
son and Bryant streets for a public plav
ground was favorably discussed. The half
of the block extending from Harriet to
Seventh was declared by the Board of
Works to have a value of $361,000, and the
committee decided to report in favor of
acquiring the property for the sum and
purpose named. This proposition must be
passed upon by the electors before the ob
ject is finally attained.
Several ladies of the California Club ad
dressed the committee in favor of beauti
fying Telegraph Hill, and they urged that
the recommendations of City Engineer
Grunsky in this connection be carried out.
The purchase of property rights on the
hill was urged, and the committee agreed
to refer the matter to the voters
The acquisition of the old Jewish Ceme
tery property, on Guerrero street, by the
city, was considered with favor by the
committee, and the matter will likewise
be. submitted to the people for their rejec
tion or approval.
Street Paving to Be Delayed.
The proposition of providing for new en
gine houses was not favorably acted UDon
Supervisor Comte said that if too many
propositions were placed before the voters
at one time they might retaliate by de
feating them all. It was decided not to
present this matter until two years hence
The matter of doing street paving on a
more extensive scale was deferred for a
similar period.
The completion of the Dewey boulevard
was also discussed and it was agreed to
report in favor of a resolution asking for
an extension of two years' time for the
Vi, 00 * 1^! 6^ 118 part of the contract
with the Adolph Sutro estate.
A. resolution was adopted requesting the
.Merchants Association to meet with the
committee next Friday and give its views
â upon the various matters passed upon bv
the committee. It is understood that no
proposition will be submitted to the people
if it can be shown by the association that

STATUTE FAVORS
AMERICAN SHIPS
Foreign Steamers Will
Lose Large Share
of Business.
By. the terms of a telegram received
yesterday from the Treasury Department
the O. and O. and the Japanese lines of
steamers, being foreign bottoms, are pro
hibited from carrying freight from the
Philippines to this port.
The clause of the statute under which
the decision was made reads as follows:
No merchandise shall be Imported (trans
ported) under penalty of forfeiture thereof from
one port of the United States to another port
of the United States in a vessel belonging
wholly or In part to a subject of a foreign
power. â â¢
In the case which forms the basis of
the decision, the merchandiseâ twenty
cases of hatsâ was shipped from Manila
to Hongkong on a British vessel and
transferred at Hongkong to the Nippon
Maru of the Japanese line and brought
to San Francisco. The Collector seized
the hats for violation of the statute just
quoted, under the recent decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States to
the effect that the Philippines art a part
of the United States.
A telegram received by the Collector
yesterday is signed by H. A. Taylor, As
sistant Secretary of the Treasury, and
reads as follows:
Forfeiture or penalty. If any. Incurred ' by
reason of the shipment mentioned in your tel
egram of 4th instant on foreign vessels to
Hongkong and then on Japan steamer Nippon
Maru to your port hereby remitted. Shipment
was made before recent decision of the Su
preme Court in so-called Philippine cases.
The foreign steamers now plying be
tween this, port and the Orient will not
be allowed to take freight from the Phii
lippines or any other territory of the
Lnited States for transportation to any
other port of this country. In view of
the Supreme Court decision, it is authori
tatively reported that- the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company will start a new line
of steamers to ply between the Philip
pines, Hawaii and -San Francisco. Cap
tain W. B. Seabury will start for the East
next week for Newport News to bring out
the J? rst of the line> the steamer Corea of
10,000 tons.
WANT STEAMSHIP LINE
DIRECT TO PHILIPPINES
Commercial Hen Attempt to Revive
Project as Result of Supreme
Court. Decision.
The decision of the United States Su
preme Court in the matter of customs on
goods imported from our Insular posses
sions in the Far Bast has roused the com
mercial men of San Francisco to new ef
forts to secure a direct steamship line to
Manila. ,
The question was agitated some time
ago and aid . was practically, promised
from, the Government, but the matter was
allowed to drop because . the risks of se
curing trade seemed too great. A through
bill of lading can now be issued where
the goods are to go on an American ship
and since the Philippines are considered
domestic territory, a profitable trade can
probably be escablished.
A committee to look after the matter
has already been appointed. W. J. Park
ing has been chosen president and E.
Scctt of the Chamber of Commerce secre
tary. Strong representation will be made
to the Washington authorities through
W. M. Bunker, the Chamber of Com
merce representative, and the regular
California delegation.
