RUHLIN, PROVING EASILY
HIS COMPLETE MASTER
No Man Before the Public, Apparently,
Has a Chance to Defeat the
Present Champion.
JAMES J. JEFFRIES retains the
title of heavyweight boxing cham

Ruhlin handily last night In five
rounds at Mechanics' Pavilion,
showing such ability as to stamp
- Him at* once the .master, of the
ring. No man who aspires to the cham

Ruh*.in was not knocked out. Billy
Madden, his manager, # who for more than
five years has coached him. Â¦ carefully in
ail the arts of the prize ring, . with the
one hope that some day he would be the
heavyweight champion, saw Jeffries was
his master last 'night' and threw up the
sponge before the gong sounded for the
sixth round.
This came as a. surprise to Jeffries and
to the spectators. After the second round
it did not require the eye of an expert to
note that Run',: strength was fast ebb
ing away. Jeffries' blows to the body,
v.-hich would have killed a man not
trained to withstand th^m, sapped all the
strength from the Akron giant and gave
him a wholesome fear of the relentless
man in front of him. Jeffries, on the
other hand, was as unconcerned as he
might be in the fastnesses of the moun
tains about Harbin Springs.
When the end came he was sitting in
his corner scorning the attentions of his
seconds, as the work he had dona was

no mere than gentle exercise. He leaned
nver to address a remark to a friend
amcr.g the spectators when Billy Madden
threw the sponge into the ring acknowl
edging defeat.
Throws Up the Sponge.
"They've thrown up the sponge," said
De Witt Van Court, one of his seconds,
touching him on the shoulder.
A look of surprise swept over Jeffries'
face. In a moment the big Pavilion was
in a turmoil. The spectators, hissed and
jpered Ruhlin and a rush' was made for
the ring. Police Captain Wittman and
his men soon stopped this, keeping the
crowd back. Jeffries went about shaking
hands v.ith friends. Ruhlin and his at
tendants were the first out of the ring and
were hissed and jeered on their way to
his dressingr-room. Ruhlin said afterward
that in the third round everything seemed
black to him. He lost his ability to judge
distance in what attacks he made and had
but little control over his powers of loco
motion.
As an exhibtion of boxing the fight was
a fiifappoiiument, but as proving- Jeffries'
claim to the championship it wan Â¦
marked success. Ruhlin's new blow which
he had been practicing was evidently a
right cross after a clinch. He tried this
repeatedly without success. Jeffries
avoided it by keeping close to Ruhlin,
making the blow ineffective.

classed him from the tap of the
gong in the first round. The
champion pegged merrily along
the road to victory with a pal
pable confidence that he was Ruhlin'a
master at the game of fisticuffs and the
only time he looked worried and disap
pointed was when Billy Madden tossed
into the ring the time-honored symbol of
defeat. I, too, was disappointed and so
HARRY E. CORBETT
waa the crowd, it was a bad ending for
' a world's championship battle, not. be
cause the average ring follower glories in
brutality and likes to ree the defeated man
Â¦ pummrled into a -pulp but because the
boxing-loving public is better satisfied.
; when the victors supremacy is clearly es
| tablished by the counting of the fatal ten
, :<- conds over the prostrate form of his de
| feated opponent:
This is the first case I believe in many
i years where a likely aspirant for the
world's championship struck his colors to
the champion by tossing up the sponge.
Of course Ruhlin was out for all light
ing purposes when Billy Madden formally
acknowledged his defeat, but at that it
were better for all parties concerned, in
cluding the spectators, who support the
boxing game, had Gus Ruhlin been al
lowed to toe the scratch for the sixlh
round and face the inevitable knockout.
Manager Madden, of course, has the
interests of his protege at heart, but the
battle would have gone to a more popular
finish had he not thrown up the sponge.
The exhibition was not brutal. Ruhl'n
was wobbling on his pins to be sure,, but
he was not badly punished nor was he
likely to be, for Jeffries kept.rfls head
and a few well-directed blows or perhaps
one would have sent Gus to the mat for
the limit. Then the people could have
filed out of the big pavilion feeling that
they had seen a spectacular finish to a
rather disappointing fight.
It was all over, to my mind when Jeffries
landed a hard right and left on Ruhlln's
battlements in the third round. When
ho went down and I began to count off
the seconds I felt that Ruhlin's chances
for lasting out the round were very slim.
The blows were terrific.
Ruhlin got up and fell into a clinch.
Jeffries coolly untangled himself from the
knot and then the gong sounded. Ruhlin
went to his corner very weak, but the
minute's rest revived him greatly and he
came back apparently strong.. He met
Jeffries with a hard right in the ribs, but
the force of the blow threw Ruhlin a
trifle back and partially around and Jeff
quickly countered him on the jaw. The
blow was a glancing one, but it dazed
Ruhlin. Again Ruhlin seemed to go to
pieces for a moment, but they- clineheu
and Gus came out of it with a clear head.
He fought like a man whose head was al
ternately befuddled and clear.
Kuhlin's Blows Are Weak.
About the middle of the fifth round Jef
fries fiddled Ruhlin around the ring and
into the Akron man's corner, where they
exchanged blbwe. Ruhlin crouched and sent
one or two weak lefts to Jeff's head, which
fell short, and the champion, after letting

STIRRING INCIDENTS
AND SCENES ATTENDING
CHAMPIONSHIP CONTEST
Description of the Crowd and How It
Behaved During the Progress
of the Battle.
TEN thousand disappointed sport
ing men left the Mechanics' Pa
vilion last evening. They had
gone there to watch two of the
leading exponents of the game of
fisticuffs battle for a champion
ship, and they came away feeling that
they had been handed another pugilistic
goldbrick. No one was willing to say that
the ending of the Jeffries-Ruhlin contest
was a fake, because they saw some fierce
blows struck during the progress of the
battle. The majority condemn the de
feated man for not taking his medicine
and few applaud him and his manager for
giving up the fight without a knockout
blew having been dealt.
Never in the history of boxing in this
city has such a vast crowd attended a
contest. Never in its history has Me
chanics' Pavilion held a more enthusias
tic and orderly crowd. Every seat in the
immense structure was filled and every
inch of standing room on the floor or in
the gallery was occupied by spectators
eager to see two humans batter each
other into insensibility. Men and boys
sought" places of vantage in the rafters
in order to get a better view. Others
crowded closer to the ring. Fortunately
no accident marred the sport. The police,
vr.der Captain Wittman, guarded every
part of the building. People were direct
ed to their seats and warned where dan
ger lay. Every precaution was taken to
prevent accidents and Jhere were none.
The incidents and scenes at the ringside
will long live in the minds of those who
were present.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
It was here that the business man
brushed elbows with his clÂ«rk, the pro
fessional man chatted with the laborer
and the youth expounded his knowledge
of the art with men i;i ;er and wiser than
himself. The smoke of the perfecto roae
in the air and mingl.'d with the fumes of
the "coffin-nail." Strangers discussed the
merits of the contestants or addressed
one another with the ''amiHarity of long
acquaintance. The excitable man amused
his neignbors by leading with his ann 3
or ducking his head every time a blow
was struck. The seasoned ring-goer sat
back in his hard chair and speculated how
long the battle would last.
The roar of the elements was a whisper
when compared with the tremendous
cheering that numan voices made when
one of the contestants scored heavily. The
hooting of the mob. the groans of the dis
appointed, the cheers ot the enthusiasts
filled the spacious structure.
Long before the hour set for the open
ing of the doors of Mechanics' Pavilion
the streets leading to the amphitheater
were black with people. They filled the
sidewalks and =treets. making it difficult
for pedestrians and vehicles to make their
way. The Pavilion wa.- the Mecca of all
men. They journeyed there afoot, in
cars, carriages and even automobiles. Po
licemen, mounted and afoot, kept the
crowds moving and prevented blockades.

TOO HIGH CLASS
FORGUSRUHLIN
Continued from Page One.
In the first two. rounds Ruhlin hit
cleaner than Jeffries and scored the most
8, but they lacked the terrible pun
ishing power of the champion. Jeffries'
hardest blow was a short right to the
body, which the spectators could hardly
see. as- it traveled but a short distance.
Behind it is Jeffries' tremendous strength
of shoulder and back, reinforced by his
femendous weight. He times his blow to
a nicety, delivering it just an instant be
fore a clinch and with his opponent com
ing toward him. Human flesh cannot
withstand this, as it tears and rips like a
shell from one of the Oregon's big guns.
This is the blow which took all the fight
out of Tom Sharkey.
Condon and Curtin Draw.
The evening's entertainment opened
with a preliminary bout between Billy
Condon and Mike Curtin. In. the very first
mix-up both men clinched and fell out
side the ring. The ropes were very loose
and the ring faulty. The first two rounds
were full of wild swings. Condon landed
a few heavy smashes* and scored first
blood. Curtin showed confidence in tha
second and worked to better advantage.
In the third Condon wrestled Curtin to
the floor and the latter remained down
until the count of five. He arose and both
men mixed. Condon was the aggressor
in the fourth, but he missed nearly every
time he led. Near the close of the round
Condon landed a heavy punch over his
opponents heart and tried to follow it
up with a heavy left swing that fell
short. The gallery became dissatisfied
with their fighting and loudly cried to
the referee to put both men out. They
improved in their work in the next round
Both men fought wild and in the clinches
landed a few on the referee. Condon tried
a left shift, but Curtin drew out of dan
ger. Condon had the best of the round.
; The seventh round found both men
tired. Condon did the leading and scored
repeatedly. Curtin was hissed for hitting
in the clinches. The eighth and last round
was fairly good. Both men ' tried hard
for a knockout, but neither could score a
winning punch. Reieree Levison right
fully called it a draw.
Welch Wins a Good Fight.
"Snider" Welch and Joe Fields were
r.ext to do battle. The lads presented dif
ferent appearances In the ring. Welch
was lanky and towered over Fields, who
proved to be a small edition of Sharkey.
The first round was full of fast woric.
Fields assumed the aggressive and landed
gome heavy blows qn his opponent's body.
"Welch retaliated with straight lefts in
the face, but Fields was not feazed.
The second round was replete with fast
fighting. They sailed in and pummeled
each ether so willingly that the crowd
went wild with delight. In one mix-up
they held on and rained heavy blows on
each other's head and body. Fields sent
Welch to the ropes with a right smash
and the lanky one bounced back with a
left on Fields' head. The round put the
crowd in good humor and it cheered when
the gong sent them to their corners.
Fields was beaten down in the third
with lefts on face and body. Fields held
ca and the gong saved him.
Welch went right at his man in the
rext round and Fields met him half way.
Fields was sent down for the count of
three. He arose and staggered Welch
with a right on the jaw. For a minute
it was either man's fight. Both men were
staggering, tut kept boring in. Fields
I roggry, but pluckily kept up the
fight. Welch was overanxious and swung
wildly. He balanced himself for a mo
ment and near the close of the round the
"Spider" swung a left on the jaw and
Fields went to the floor and was counted
out. It was the- best preliminary battle
Been in this city for years. Welch won
because he could take a punch and de
liver them with plenty of steam.

reached Ruhlin directly in the solar plexus
with a vicious left hook. Ruhlin winced
and stumbled to the floor, but he man
aged to get up inside the limit. Jeffries
stood off and let Ruhlin make one or two
weak attempts to reach his vulnerable
spot with the left and then Jeff sent in
another hard right to the body. At the
close of the round Ruhlin went to his cor
ner very groggy and then Madden threw
up the sponge. I walked over to Madden
and asked him why he had thrown up the
sponge, and he said:
"Harry, there's no use letting him stand
up there and take all that punching for
nothing. He can't win."
As far as Maddens statement about
Rhulin not having a chance is concerned,
everybody who saw the fight knew as
well as he did that Ruhlin could not win,
.but I believe In common with the ma
jority of those at the ringside that had
Madden sent him up for the next round
Jeffries would have knocked Ruhlin out,
and then everybody would have been bet
ter satisfied.
As a championship battle the contest
was not a success. When the two men
faced each other it could be seen that
Ruhlin was uncertain and fidgety and a
trifle timid. He might have been using
careful tactics, but Tie looked to me like
a man who felt a bit frightened. In the
first two rounds Ruhlin did some fairly
good fighting. He backed away from Jeff
repeatedly, but when the champion bored
in on him Ruhlin met him once or twice
with hard jolts in the body. In the sec
ond round Ruhlin smashed Jeffries In the
mouth and drew blood. Jeffries became
riled and returned the compliment with a
succession of jolts in the stomach.
Once in the third round Jeffries sent
Ruhlin up against the ropes with a
straight left in the eye, and followed it
with a smash in tho stomach. Ruhlin
backed further up against the ropes and
murmured something about the. blow be
ing foul, but I had my eye on both
punches, and the las; blow was well
above the stomachy Ruhlin complained'
several times about Jeffries boring in
after the breakaway, but this to my mind
was perfectly fair. If Jeffries did not Â«cc
fit to step back after a breakaway In
which he made no attempt to hit Gus' he
had as much right to lo it as Ruhlin had
to break ground.
Taking everything Into consideration
both men fought a good, clean battle in
which nobody figured as a winner but

1 a million to land even an accidental punch that would have turned
the tide of battle in his. favor, there are many sporting men who be
eve that as long as a seemingly defeated man is on his feet the unex
pected might happen, and had Madden allowed Ruhlin to come up for
the' sixth round for his medicine I think everybody would have been better satisfied. The
punishment Jeff was inflicting on Ruhlin was not brutal. It was not a case where one man was
a chopping-block for the other. Ruhlin, course, was weak and in distress, but at the same
. time he was able to protect. himself fairly well. Jeffries was timing his blows too well for the
bout to have developed into an inhuman affair. ;, I think it was * only a question .of about
twenty or thirty seconds of the sixth round when Jeff would have polished Ruhlin off with a
well-directed sleep-producer, and then the thousands who paid their good money to see the
championship battle would have left the big pavilion feeling no disappointment. The almost
imperceptible jar of Jeff's punches told on Ruhlin. I could see the effect of ' Jeff's punches
better than those who sat away from the ringside. k When Ruhlin went down f or 'the count in
the second round I thought then that a few more seconds of the round would end the bout.
Ruhlin 'complained several times about Jeffries pressing him in r the breakaways, but Jeff had a
perfect right to bore in as long as Ruhlin broke ground. If Ruhlin objected to Jeffries'

JEFFRIES WILL TJMPTBE
A LEAGUE BALL GAME
After searching over the entire country
for a man capable of umpiring a base
ball game to the satisfaction of both
â¢ r
sides and the spectators Included, the
management of the California League
have hit upon James J. Jeffries as the
man to fill the long felt want. The cham
pion was last night chosen to umpire the
game between Los Angeles and Oakland
next Sunday at Recreation Park. Jeffries
is fully capable of fulfilling these arduous
duties, having played ball since boyhood.
There is no danger that his decisions
will be doubted by the players. Jeffries
will be too big for the ball tossers to at
tack unless they use a bat. Instead of
fining them for giving "back sass," Jim
may show the spectators his method of
beating champion aspirants and unruly
ball players.

his father, took up positions in line in
order to secure the beot seats in the gal
lery. They waited pauently all the aay,
and as the hours passed they were rein
forced by hundreds vi others, until a line
wound itself around tlic Pavilion until it
met at the entrance.
The small boy reaped a harvest by dis
posing of hia place 111 line to late comers.
The ticket scalper sold tickets at a pre
mium that added to hia bank account. t>o
eager were men to see the championship
battle that they were willing and did give
double the price on the face of the ticKet.
Before the doors were thrown open the
house had practically been sold out. It
was then that the SDeculator came for
ward and lured shekels by his enticing
pasteboards.
Crowds Grow Impatient.
Owing to a misunderstanding the doors
were not opened until 7:15 o'clock. The
crowds became impatient at the dela
gave a welcome shout when they began
to move toward their goal. Then there
was a hurrying and scurrying, pushing
and shoving that made an animated pic
ture. The building echoed with the shouts
of the crowd and the cries of the ushers
and the ever-present peanut butcher.
It was noticed that the house was filled
with strangers. They came from, every
portion of California, from nearby States
and from the distant East. All were
anxious to witness the championship con
test and they will return home with a
morsel of conversation*that will last them
many a day.
The \ight-flngered gentry plied their ne
farious calling and gathered enough val
uables to start a small-sized jewelry store.
The more bolder thief, anxious to view
the contest without depleting his purse,
snatched pasteboards and escaped in the
crowd. The unfortunates were tauwht a
lesson, took their loss philosophically, and
bought other tickets.
The Pavilion tilled up very rapidly. An
announcement, had been made that the
champion and the aspirant for champion
ship laurels would appear in the ring
promptly at 3:15 o'clock. This promise was
kept and the public was satisfied. The
preliminary battles were interesting and
occupied the attention of the spectators
during the interim.
Jeffries arrived at the Pavilion shortly
after 8 o'clock and wint to his dressing
room on the second fleer. He was accom
panied by his trainer, Billy Delaney; his
sparring partners. Jack Jeffries and Bob
Armstrong, and intimate friends. The big
fellow was in high spirits and displayed
none of the nervousness one would ex
pect a champion to show on the eve of
a battle. He laughed and joked and gave
every indication that he was full of confi
dence. How different was it in Ruhlin's
dressing-room. Here everything was sub
dued. A feeling of Impending dtsaster
hovered in the air. Ruhlin tried to appear
happy, but his mtnd was filled with the
contract before him. He rested up to the
hour of going into the ring.
Jeffries Warmly Received.
"When the preliminary contests were
concluded workmen spread a nice new
canvas over the ring. Its whiteness was
reflected in the powerful light given by
eighty arc lamps suspended from an as
bestos canopy over the rins- The light
was dazzling at first, but the people close
to the ring became accustomed to it.
Jeffries was first to put in an appearance.
As the champion's form was discerned in
the semi-darkness a mighty cheer rent
the air. He was clad in a red sweater,
and his powerful jaws munched a hunk o*
gum. He was greeted on every side and
he responded to the well wishes with
smiles, happy replies and nods. In hi.*
wake came his trainer, the ever faithful
Delaney, and his seconds. Within a few
minutes Ruhlin followed and received a
hearty reception. The aspirant's features
wore a half smile, but he seemed to be
Imbued with a feeling that he had a harH
contract on hand and he had careworn
lines on his face.
The moment the men were in the ring
there was a craning of necks. Men in
the anxiety to get a better view of the
ring pressed forward and were in danger
of meeting with an accident. In the gal
lery they pressed again3t a balustrade,
but were dislodged from their dangerous
position by the police. There were cries
of "sit down" mingled with derisive yells
Pandemonium reigned until the gong 3ent
the men to their work. Then a silence
stole over the building that contrasted
strangely with the noise of a minute be
fore. It was an expectant hush and wad
broken from time to time by the shouts
of approval given for either contestant
Before the battle Harry Corbett was pre
sented with a miniature bear by the mem
bers of tha Bakersfield Bear Club in ap
preciation of Corbett's prowess as a
hunter.
During the progress of the battle Billy
Maddens face was a study. The heavy
blows Jeffries landed on Ruhlin seeme-l
to give Madden greater pain than his pro
tege. There was suffering in his face and
nervousness in his demeanor. Many
watched the manager throughout the bat
tle and pitied him every time he winced
Eddie Miller, a lame boy. who has al
ways acted as mascot to Jeffries when he
fought in this city, was present last night
The boy was in his element, and wai
proud that he brought luck to the cham
pion.
Eager to Pose,
At the close of the battle youths anx
ious to have their faces appear in the
moving pictures jumped into the ring and
performed for posterity' 3 benefit. Some
jealous individual seated close to the pho
tographing apparatus tried to foil them
by placing his hat over the camera. When
this was discovered by the operators the
mischievous person was given a beating
The crowd quickly dispersed. As soon
as the Pavilion was cleared the lights
were extinguished and the telegraph op
erators, anxious to send the news of the
battle to other cities, i.eked off their news
with the aid of candies.
There was g'.oom in Ruhlin's dressing
room after the content. Every one felt
sad. Friends tried to enliven the defeat
ed man, but their words of cheer had lit
tle effect. A scene of rejoicing was pre
sented in the victor's dressing-room. Jef
fries was like a schoolboy. He was show
ered with congratulations, but had pres
ence of mind to tell his trainers to look
after hi 3 costume, as certain people might
carry the garments off as souvenirs
"Syndicate" Bob Armstrong wore a smile
as large as a slice out of a piece of water
melon. Delaney was contented, and the
others were alike happy.
Acquitted on Murder Charge.
J. Menander, a longshoreman, who wai
charged with the murder of James Peter
son, a marine painter, at Battery and
Jackson streets, by stabbling him twice
was acciuitted by Judge Cabaniss yester
day after Attorney Caldwell had made a
motion to dismiss. The jury at the In
quest Thursday brought in a verdict of
justifiable homicide, aa Menaader had
acted in self-defense.
Administered Knockout Drops.
John Baker was held to answer before
the Superior Court by Judge Cabanlss in
$1000 bonds yesterday on the felony charge
of administering knockout drops. He met
William Street, a machinist from Vallejo,
in a Kearny-street saloon and put several
drops of chloral into his beer. Street had
to be taken to the Receiving Hospital and
for a time was in a serious condition.

Hood's Pill* cnrÂ« livÂ«r fIU : the non-irritating Mid
only cathartic to tafca with Hood's SarMparluZEXPERTS SAY RUHLIN COULD NOT WIN
DELANEY SORRY CONTEST
WAS SO UNSATISFACTORY
ELANEY, Jeffries' manager, said: "I
knew Jeffries would win. I saw that he
had Ruhlin's measure from the very out
set, and I thought it was but a question of
time when Gus would be forced to give
up the battle. lam very much pleased
with the result, but would have been bet
ter pleased if it had ended in another way.
It is the first championship battle that was
won and lost that way. Although the man
was punched harder than the spectators appreciated, still it
would have been better if Ruhlin had been counted out. It gives
the people a chance to talk, and this has a bad effect upon the
fighting game. Jeffries cannot be blamed. He did all the forc
ing, and followed his opponent all over the ring from bell to
bell. Jim was in splendid condition. Not a blow that Ruhlin
landed caused him any bother. He had not begun to fight. Had
he gone at his man as we all know he can, he would have made
things lively. He has a punch that hurts when it lands. Ruhlin
simply could not stand those he received. When he went to his
corner at the close of the fifth round I knew that Ruhlin was
beaten. It therefore did not surprise me to see Madden throw
up the sponge. I felt all along that Jeffries would win, and the
same confidence I had was felt by the champion. He was as
cool as a cucumber, and fought just as I wanted him to fight.
He did not hurry, because he had plenty of time before him.
That Jim is entitled to the title of heavy-weight champion of
the world was borne out, in my opinion, to-night. He is now
ready to fight Fitzsimmons or Tom Sharkey. Jeffries will go
out of training for a week or so and then return to Harbin to
prepare for his next contest, if one can be arranged.' 1

CHAMPION'S MOTHER HAS
FAITH IN HIS PROWESS
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 15.â Mrs. Jeffries, mother of the redoubtable James J., had
such an abiding faith in her son's prowess that she would not leave home to-night, but
retired early, just about the time her son entered the ring. So confident of the outcome
was she that when asked if she cared to come downtown and read the reports of the
battle in the north, she said:
"No, I will wait until the morningâ we will all know then. That will be soon enough "
Mrs. Jeffries believed that a few hours of waiting would not change the outcome a bit
and so she looked at the matter in a philosophical way. She has not heard from Jim re
cently and does not know much about the fight.
"You know more about it than I," she said this evening. "None of us know anything
for sure. \\ c wil| all know in the morning."
Mrs. Jeffries does not approve of her son's business, but inasmuch as he has adopted
fighting as a profession, she is proud to see him at the top of the list.
The champion's mother expressed some solicitude when informed that it was raining
in San Francisco, but concurred in the belief that those who had journeyed so far to see the
battle would not be deterred from seeing it by a little thing like rain.
"I suppose they already have bought their tickets," said Mrs. Jeffries. She knows her
son is not fighting for his health, and properly has an eye to the main chance.
John Jeffries, the preacher, the father of the champion, has written from Europe that,
though he despises his son's occupation, he hopes that, so long as James is fighting, he will
be successful. The elder Jeffries was confident his son would be returned a winner in his
fight with Ruhlin.
Jim's sister looked at his battle much as did her mother. She had the same abiding
faith in the man's strength and good fortune as had others of the Jeffries family. None of the
family seem to think that this was the time James J. Jeffries was to lose the championship.
Mrs. Jeffries agreed that "they all must lose some time," but she did not think the occasion
had yet arrived.

THE RIVAL GLADIATORS AND SOME NOTABLBS WHO SAW THE FIGHT.
JEFFRIES' HARD BLOWS
IN THE FIRST ROUND
TOO MUCH FOR RUHLIN
BEFORE the last brace of boxers
In the preliminary bouts were
out of the ring, men representing
the Edison Company appeared
with a new canvas of dazzling
Â¦whiteness for the ring floor. This
was intended to reflect the fierce
light which beat down upon the boxers
and make sure of the success of the pic
ture machine.
A frame suspended over the ring held a
number of arc lamps which threw a total
of 80,000 candle-power light upon the ring.
When the light was turned on the faces
of the spectators near the ring were
thrown out in bold relief. A ripple of ap
plause went through the house as the
view burst upon the spectators. It was as
light as noon-day in the immediate vi
cinity of the ring, the remainder of Ihe
pavilion being In semi-darkness, as the
other lights were turned out. Jeffries was
the first of the boxers to put in an appear
ance. He came down the aisle dressed in
a bright red sweater and black trousers
and shaded his eyes with his hand as lie
entered the ring. Following him were Dc
ianey and his attendants.
Ruhlin climbed through the ropes from
the opposite side of the ring and imme
diately sat down. Jeffries eyed him cu
riously, and then strolled about the ring,
testing the holding quality of his shoes
on the new canvas. Some friend at the
ringside handed him up a gray golf cap,
which he put on, doing away with the
necessity of shading his eyes.
Ruhlin selected the southwest corner of
the ring-. There was a short discussion
as to where the men should sit, resulting'
in Madden and Delaney tossing a coin for
choice. Delaney won, and chose the cor
ner in which Ruhlin was sitting. Jeffries
was seconded by Billy Delaney, Jack Jef
fries, Dewitt Van Court and his sparring
partner, Bob Armstrong. Behind Ruhlin
were Billy Madden, Charles Goff, Denver
Ed Martin and Young Gibus. The time
keepers were: For the club, George
Harding; for Jeffries, Jack Roberts, and
for Ruhlin, Phil Wand.
Fighters Are Introduced.
Billy Jordan, the master of ceremonies,
presented the men to the spectators. He
first led out Ruhlin and, with a wave of
his hand, said, "the Akron giant, Gus
Ruhlin." He then took Jeffries to the
center of the ring and announced him as
"the only champion of the world, James
Jeffries." "Harry Corbett will referee
this contest," was his introduction of the
referee.
Police Captain Wittman entered the
ring and he was handed the gloves the
men were to wear. He felt of them care
fully and pronounced them satisfactory.
Madden and Delaney also Inspected the
gloves and apparently had no fault to
tind with them. The usual conference in
midring between the principals and the
referee was a brief one. They shook
hands and agreed readily to the instruc
tions given them by the referee. Tim
McGrath challenged the winner on behalf
of Tom Sharkey. The friends of Harry
Corbett from Bakersfleld at this juncture
sent a toy bear into the ring and this was
presented to Harry Corbett. It bore the
following inscription:
"Presented to Harry E. Corbett, the
bear hunter, by the Bakersfleld Bear
Club."
There was a slight dispute as to wheth
er Corbett or the timekeepers would count
off the ten seconds if either man was
knocked down, Delaney said: "We agreed
that Harry Corbett was to do the count
ing.'' He then directed his conversation
to the timekeepers and said: "No one is
to count out loud except the referee."
When Jeffries stripped down it was seen
he was dressed in black trunks with an
American .flag around his waist. Before
he commenced fighting he removed this
and attached it to the ring post in his
corner. Ruhlin wore closely knitted white
trunks.
Billy Jordan announced: "This fight is
for twenty rounds, Marquis of Queens
berry rules. Will break at the order of
the referee."
The two principals and the referee were
left alone in the rinp. and the gong sent
them together for the first round. They
fiddled about for a few moments, when
Ruhlin led with his left, landing lightly
on the body. Jeffries then crowded him
around the ring, Ruhlin backing off and
poking out his left. Jeffries led and land
ed lightly on the body. He showed the
utmost confidence in himself and did not
try to evade some of the blows. Ruhlin
jabbed Jeffries on the mouth and Jeffries
followed with a right io the body. Ruh
lin sent a right to the heart without re
turn. Jeffries missed a left swing and
Ruhlin ducked another on the breakaway.
There were some light exchanges, and
then Jeffries sent a right to the body,
which Ruhlin claimed after the fight
shook him up considerably. It appeared
Ruhlin intended to make a runaway fight,
as he kept backing away from Jeffries
during the latter part of the round.
When the men went to their corners
Ruhlin looked far from being happy,
while Jeffries had apparently not done
enough work to make him breathe hard.
He required no attention from his seconds
Continued on Pag-e Five.
SILER SAYS RUHLIN HAD
ATTACK OF STAGE FRIGHT
GEORGE SILER, the oldest and most prominent referee in America, who came here to
report the fight for his paper, the Chicago Tribune, was disappointed at the outcome
and had very little to say about the result. In an interview he gave his views tersely.
"I thought in the beginning that the result was a foregone conclusion. I was
very much surprised, however, at Ruhlin's poor showing. I thought from the reports I had
of his good condition and the speed he showed while boxing with Ed Martin that he would
give Jeffries a pretty good fight. Of course we all know he easily outpointed the champion
in the first four rounds. His hitting was very much the cleaner, but his alleged redoubtable
left on which he depended to win the fight was not in evidence. He landed with it often
enough, but there was no steam behind it. His best blows, those which proved to be the most
effective, were rights to the body. Ruhlin was nervous, had no confidence, and seemed to be
troubled with stage fright.
Jeffries, fought just as I expected. He said weeks sgo that he would not stay away
but would force the battle, which he did. He found in Ruhlin rather a hard man to catch 1
thought the fight would end in the third round, when Jeff landed a hard left hook Ruhlin
was clever enough to stay the round out by clinching. The fight was the poorest champion
ship battle that ever occurred in this country. It is questionable whether Ruhlin could have
gone much farther at the time he stopped. It is a difficult thing to gauge the shape
he was in after receiving several hard punches in the stomach from a hitter like Jeffries. Mad
den declared he saw no use in having his man butchered, and he is a good judge. If Ruhlin
could have fought all night he would have had no chance to ultimately win. In a word the
fight was in every sense unsatisfactory, and I was greatly disappointed at the weak battle
that Ruhlin put up.
MADDEN EXPLAINS REASON
FOR THROWING UP SPONGE
ILLY MADDEN has this to say:
J "After the third round I saw that my man
ras out of it, and when Jeffries slugged
im all over the ring in the fifth round I
new it was no use letting Ruhlin stay
lere. Therefore when he came to his cor
er at the end of the fifth round I decided
d throw up the sponge. Gus was weak
nd almost defenseless and I did not want
> let him go up for the terrific grueling
received in the sixth round. Fitz gave
in the same round of their fight,*and
when I saw that Ruhlin did not have a single chance in ten mil
lion to win I did what I thought was a humane thing to do.
There is no use letting a man stand up and take punishment sim
ply because the audience want to see a man knocked out. lam
more disappointed over the result of the battle than anybody
knows. I thought Gus would win to a certainty, but fate was
against us. Jeffries is a big, strong fellow with a terrific punch,
and he got the lead on my man in the third round. He hit Gus
several stp raps on the jaw which dazed him and left him open
for left and right hand jolts in the stomach. I think the body '
blows did the trick. Ruhlin might have fought a round or two
more and he might not. At any rate he had no chance to trim
the boiler-maker, and rather than see him unmercifully pum
meled I threw up the sponge. In the first round Gus hit the
champion several hard jolts in the ribs which I think hurt Jef
fries. He sent a straight left to Jeff's mouth which drew blood
and shook the champion up a bit, and if Ruhlin had a chance to
win it was then. If Jeffries had not caught Ruhlin that left
hook in the body in the third round there might have been a dif
ferent story to tell.
BETTING THE LIGHTEST
EVER KNOWN ON CONTEST
IN CHAMPIONSHIP CLASS
THE betting on the fight was t)ve
lightest ever known in a cham
pionship fight here. The chief
reason for this was that oppor
tunities for extensive wagering
were not present owing to the
anti-gambling law. The principal
places where money couid be placed were
the cigar stands in the lower part of the
city.
Hardly more than $20,000 was placed on
the outcome of the fight, as the money
was chiefly placed in small amounts. The
betting opened yesterday at 10 to 5, but
the avidity with which the admirers of
Ruhlin snapped at this price sent the odds
to 20 to 9. This was the price throughout
the day. After the price became settled
betting men who favored Jeffries figured
a way by which they could get better re
turns for their money. They bet even
money Jeffries would win inside twelve
rounds. All afternoon the admirer, of
Ruhlin were ready with their money ?u
small amounts, but men to back Jeffrie*

FOOTBALL GAME FOR THE M'KINLEY FUND
LOWELL SCHOOL
ELEVEN MEETS
SANTA CLARA
Sharp, Snappy Play Looked
For From the Clever Teams
on Folsom - Street Field
THE football, elevens of Lowell
High School and Santa Clara Col
lege will meet this afternoon at 3
o'clock at Sixteenth and Folsom
streets. The game is under the
direction of the Academic Athletic League
officials and is for the benefit of the Mc-
Kinley memorial fund, the entire receipts
being devoted to that object.
The Lowell team has won every game
it has played this year. Berkeley High
and Napa High have each won their sub
leagues and will play a game Saturday.
The winner of that gameâ probably
Berkeleyâ will play Lowell for the cham
pionship. These two teams also were in
the finals last year. The style of play of
the two teams is similar. Both play a
speedy game and masses on tackles and
loose formations on end runs are much
used â¢Â¦ by them. Berkeley is also strong
on the defense, while this is Lowell's one
rather weak point. They are, however,
practicing daily to overcome this weak
ness.
Lowell will be given an excellent op
portunity to show its ability to-day. San
ta Clara has, excepting her first game, Â¦
won every game this season. Since the.
Berkeley-Stanford game several Berkeley
men have been assisting the Lowell team
in their work, and the result is already
being seen in practice.
Mr. Castlehoun, a Berkeley tackle of
two seasons ago, assisted by Pete Cook,
an old Lowell guard, have worked dili
gently in Lowell's behalf. With a small
squad they have built a speedy, scientific
eleven which, though light, is still a line
smashing team. Lowell has not been
scored again this season and 'â¢ recently
placed and defeated two teams in one
afternoon.
The Santa Clara team Is a much heav
ier team. They have played a great many
games this season and only in their first
against the Stanford, freshmen were they
beaten.
Santa Clara's defense is her strong
point, though under competent coaching
her end formations have a clockwork reg
ularity and her mass plays great force.
End running seems to be Santa Clara's
favorite play, and on the defense her ends
have seldom been run around this season
for anything like a sure gain. The line
is particularly strong and the center trio
work well together. Cutter, an ex-Olym
pic player, acknowledged by many to be
the best punter on the coast, plays full
back for them and should do good work
for his team. Against him in punting is
Hamilton. Lowell's young kicker. Hamil
ton's strong point is kicking goals from
the field, having accomplished this feat
several times this season Iron) behind the
25-yard line.
A pretty contest should result from the
kicking. Both men punt high. Both
teems have fast, speedy ends that get
down the field on punts.
There should be a good attendance. The
field will perhaps be heavy, but not
enough so to spoil end running. The
teams will line up:

CRACK FOOTFALL ELEVEN OF LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL WHICH PLAYS TO-DAY FOR THS BENEFIT OF McKINLEY FUND.
DECLARE MEET
AT PETALUMA
BIG SUCCESS
Local Leashmen Satisfied
With Outcome of Recent
Coirsing Away From Home
The coursing men of this city are more
than pleased at the outcome of the open
plains meeting, held this week at Peta
luma. Not that they came home with
increased bank rolls, for the Egg City
sports on the second day of the meet
had the visitors all but out. Luck and
good coursing had brought D. J. Healey's
great little performer Fcr Glory to the
final to compete with Aeolus. Petaluma
was behind its representative to a man
and was not slow at making good in the
pool boxes. The city delegation kept re
sponding until they had forced their
choice from even money to odds of 5 to
4. Aeolus showed a great lead and despite
the fact that For Glory had the favor
of the hare and at one time was within
a point of his score, outworked the Henley
kennel entry for the flag in a fine trial.
A feature of the meeting and one that
was responsible to a great extent for its
ultimate success was the grand showing
maile by the dogs of the Prinoe of Peta
ruma. Seven time 1 ? in the rurf down the
hounds t>f his kennel were sent to the
slips and on every occasion were returned
winners. After each victory a crowd of
the new enthusiasts would line up at the
pool box and cash for food suims. Their
repeated successes made new converts to
the cport and before the tirst round was
finished money was freeiy offered at even
that the star performer of the kennel,
Sisqiioo, would carry off first honors.
\ hile no doubt many of the bettors of
fering the price were carried away with
local pride, the offer at that time looked
an even proposition. The following day,
however. Sisquoo met his fate in his trial
with Slim, his half-brother. No one looked
for anything but a one-sided trial. Slim
proved a surprise evvn to his supporters,
who played him for luck alone because
of his long price. Slim nipped the hare
but lost it and Sisquoo by killing made
it an undecided. In the next trial Slim
was saved by the kill. Then in a hard
course Sisquoc won out. After beating
Miss Wilson in a long go. Sisquoc put up
a wonderful trial with St. Ives and was
in possession when the course ended.
The one sad feature of the meeting was
the death of Achilles. Mike Nealon's besi
performer. Achilles was liberated in an
InclofUre near town for a romp. Nealon
missed him but after a search found him
dead, near the fence. Ills neck was
broken.
Wasps and Senators Tie.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 15.â The San
Fr%.ncipoos and the Sarramentos played
a nine-inning tie game this afternoon, the
score standing: 5 to 5 when the game was
called on account of darkness. Both
Stricklett and Iburg were found frequent
ly, but it was Doyle's throw in from right
field that lost the game for the locals.
IFis throw landed near the pitcher's box
and as none of the infield were there to
receive it. as they should have been, the
ball rolled out to the bleachers and al
lowed two runs to score. The attendance
was light and the day cold and cloudy.

FLYING CRUZADOS GALLOPS HOME
FOR ANOTHER PURSE AT OAKLAND
LUCKY" BALDWIN'S sensational
colt Cruzados gave another pleas
ing exhibition of speed over a
muddy track yesterday at Oak
land. The son of Emperor of
Norfolk practically fell heir to the purse,
for the conditions let him in with a
bur.eh of plebeians when compared to
this equine. A 1 to 8 favorite, he won in
a Â«rreat, big gallop. Lengths in his wake,
Phyllis, a 20 to 1 shot, outgained Dr.
Scharff for the place.
Favorites began by taking the first
three races off the reel. Then there was
a reaction and the remaining three
choices went down to defeat. When the
inclemency of the weather is considered,
the attendance was large.
Quite a number of short end players re
ceived a severe jarring over the downfall
of Andrisa in the six and a half furlong
sprint. It was the St. Andrew mare's
first start at the meeting and, with La
Goleta scratched she ruled a 2 to 5
chance. Evidently a trifle short, the fa
vorite was led from start to finish by
Prejudice, the second choice. There were
but four starters.
Duckoy, with â¢â¢Jess" Matthews up. was
s<nt to the post an even money favprite
:,'ii(i won "a city block." The balance of
the rifld was strung out for a sixteenth
of a mile. Rasp beating the tiring Letiger
for the place. |
Jack Atkins useful throe-year-old DJd^
rot. with O'Connor in the saddle, held
first place in the betting on the third
evtnt, a six-furlong run. Maresa cut out
the running to the stretch, with Mrs.
HrunHl at her heels. O'Connor now hus
tled the favorite along and, assuming the
lead, led Bernota out three lengths.
Again Bangor, the notorious sulker,
proved a good friend of the layers of
orids. Sent out an X to R favorite "for the
r.ilc- and three-sixteenth numl>e.r, he foil
out of it. and then coming from the out
skirts finished second. Galanthus, a 5 to
1 chance, piloted by Fauntleroy, won all
the way under closely reefed sails. Ar
tilla dropped into the show.
Nothing like the reversal shown by
Cutto in the last event has been sei'h
since the meeting opened. The betting
and everything connected with the horse's
win was so glaring as to be really invig
orating. Ridden in absurd fashion only
two days ago, when heavily played by
the public, he finished last, Logue taking
him completely out of the running on the
i far turn, yesterday, with Ransch up and
bet on by a select few, there was noth
ing to the race from start to finish but
Gusto. Away poorly, Dunblane, the fa
vorite, led out Reina de Cuba for the
place.
Track Notes.
Otey Evans and Henry Flittner, two
well known employes of Bookmaker
George Rose, arrived on last night's over
land. Otey is rapidly recovering from a

SANITARIUM DECLARED
A PUBLIC NUISANCE
Mrs. Reeves Atkinson Arrested on
Complaint of One of Her
Neighbors.
Mrs. Reeves Atkinson, who has a pri
vate sanitarium at ISIS Sutter street, was
arrested yesterday on a warrant charging
her with maintaining a nuisance. The
complaining witness is J. H. BonMg, 1714
Post street, and he declares that the san
itarium is a nui?ance to the neighborhood
and tenants are threatening to vacate
their houses owing to the unearthly noises
made by the inmates at all hours of ths
night.
Mrs. Atkinson was released on $50 cash
bail. She says she will fight the case to
the bitter end. Some of the most prom
inent men in the city, she says, are or
have been inmates of the sanitarium, and
she deems it a oublic necessity. Attempts
have been frequently made by residents
in the neighborhood to have the institu
tion removed, but they have always sig
nally failed. Mrs. Atkinson denies thac
the noises are as bad as the residents as,
*ert. and certainly not enough to be called
a nuisance.

TENNIS COURTS
ATTRACT MANY
NEW PLAYERS'
Ladies Show Most Marked
Interest in Pastime Which
Is Experiencing a Revival
Many tournaments are being planned
by the tournament committee of the Cali
fornia Tennis Club. The next event will
be held to-morrow. The handling of the
mixed doubles tournament caused dissat
isfaction on Wednesday, as no member of
the tournament commUtee was present.
The women should be given all the en
couragement possible in order that they
may at least make a showing against th?
Suttons next year. They were enthusi
astic and turned out in force, but tho
men were scarce. The low standard of
play among the local women is largely
due to the men, who do little toward er
couraging them. The women are already
planning another tournament, which wtU
be In the form of a doubles, partners to
be drawn by lot.
Most of the playing on the local courts
is done between * and 5 o'clock in the aft
ernoon, when the courts are hardly nu
merous enough to accommodate the play
ers. Among the most regular attendant
are Judges Sloss, Kerrigan, Hunt and
Troutt. The two former are usually op
posed to the latter, with honors, as a
rule, about even. Judge Sloss is easily
the best player of the Judges, but he has
had more experience than his colleagues.
Others who play almost every day ar.il
who are showing constant lmprovemen;
are John Gibson Sr., Hugh Hume, C D.
Galvin, Gorham and J. Gibson Jr.
Many ladies put in the mornings on the
courts and some give promise of develop
ing into good clay* rs. The most promis
ing are the Mlsaea Smith. Giestlng. Whit
ney. Farnsworth, Salisbury, Meyer an-1
Hoar.

the public courts in Golden Gate Park.
On the contrary, as the courts improve
the attendance becomes much heavier.
The park players seem to be learning ttu;

the San Francisco Golf Club is nearlng m
conclusion, \V. H. La Boyteaux having
won a place in the final 'round by defeat
ing Captain D. J. Rumbaugh 4 up 3 to

bot-Golcher match. The trophy is a dark
oak cup with horn handles. Few of the
Presidio golfers have improved more rap
idly than H. C. Golcher, whose game is
strong and steady. In the second rounl
of the handicap tournament he received
three strokes and beat John Lawson 2 up
1 to piny. At this rate he will soon be the
strongest of the native-born golfers of
this city.

OTTO FEUDNER
ENJOYS YEAR'S
RECORD SHOOT
Secures Forty Fine Drake
Mallards and Ten "Cans'"
at Denverton, Near Suisun
Otto Feudner has been the most envied
sportsman in the city during the pa3t
week owing to a grand shoot he enjoyed
last Sunday at Denverton, near Suisun.
He was the guest of Mr. Stewart and shot
ever the preserves bearing that gentle
man's name.
Â©tto secured the limit bag of fifty duckÂ».
but they were so numerous he could have
killed several times as many. He con-
tented himself with biding his time and
picking out the best of the great flight
of ducks. As a result his bag was made
up of ten "cans" and forty splendid mal
lards. Of these thirty-seven were drakes,
being picked out by their green heads.
Otto was so pleased with the quality of
the sport afforded that he will endeavor
to form a club to take over the ponds for
the season. The only drawback to them,
is that they are nine miles from S.uisun.
although the road is a good one.
The conditions were favorable at the
majority of places about the bay. A i
army of men were out and few returned
empty handed. The conditions are again
favorable this week if the impending
storm does not break. The pools In the
interior fields formed by the recent rains
have dried out and the birds are expected

Judge Carroll Cook of . the Superior
Court rendered a decision recently vital
interest to sportsmen and dealers In game
as it bears upon the section of the Penal
Cede which prohibits the sale of certain
game birds and animals. He denied a
writ of habeas corpus sued out by S. Ken
neke. He followed the decision of tha
Supreme Court, which held valid a stat
ute almost identical In words with he
one in cuestlon in the case before him.
The section of the Penal Code in question
follows:
Every person who buys, sells, offer* or ex
pose., for sale, barter or trade any quail
partridge, pheasant, grouse, sage-hen ibis or
plover or any deer meat, whether taken or
killed in the State of California or shipped Into
the State from any other State. Territory or
foreign country. Is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Judge Cook's decision in part follows:
"Respondent cites several cases from the
Eastern States, wherein similar laws ha\e
been sustained, but If a decision of this ques
tion rested solely Tipon the cases so cited. I
hardly feel that I would be justified Jn ac
cepting them as authority. The ; identical
question here presented has, however been
passed upon by our own Supreme Court, ana
a statute almost identical in language has
been held by the Supreme Court of this State
to be valid and within the power of the Legis
lature to enact. Until, therefore. - the- >Â¦ last
mentioned decision shall have been overruled
by our Supreme Court It is my duty, m well
as that* of all Superior Courts of this State.
to follow, as the law or t*Â»e State, that decision
irrespective of any opinion I myself might have
as to the validity of this statute. .
The learned Justice who wrote the opinion
:n that case, after devoting some space to a
construction of the statute, decided that it
meant not only game killed within the State
of California, but also that which had been
killed elsewhere and brought into the Slate,
proceeds to discuss the question of its validity
and in that portion of the decision uses the
following language:
"Nor do we think that In giving the act this
effect It contravenes the constitution of this
State as being in excess of the police power'
of this State. The wild game within the State'
belongs to the people in their collective, sov
ereign capacity; It Is not the subject of private
ownership,' except In so far as they may elect
to make It bo; and they may if they see fit
absolutely prohibit . the taking of It or any
traffic or commerce in ft If deemed necessary
for Its protection or preservation or the public
good."
The protection and preservation of game has
been secured by law In all civilized countries
and may be justified on many grounds, one of
which 19 for the purposes of food. The meas

lature to determine, and courts cannot review

FIGHT AGAINST
TAX REDUCTION
Ways and Means Com
mittee Favors Cau
tiousness.
Brewers and Distillers Will
Make Strong Effort to Cut
Down War Revenues.
Â»^
Special Dispatch to The Call. .
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET N. W.,
WASHINGTON, Nov. Members of the
House of Representatives who are in fa
vor of avoiding tariff reduction by abol
ishing all war tuxÂ« will not find plain
sailing. Already there is opposition among
members of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, and Representatives Hopkins and
Tawney, both of whom returned to town
to-day, expressed themselves most decid
edly in favor of proceeding with caution.
Payne, chairman of the committee, is said
to be preparing a bill fcr a. heavy reduc
tion to be introduced at the "opening of
the session, and this early division of
opinion in the committee indicates that
Payne's plan will have bitter opposition. '
Hopkins is most decided in his views
and will urge a postponement of any re
duction until it is known what the ap
propriations will be for the coining year. Â¦Â¦
"Let us first hear from the appropri
ations committee" he said, "how much is
this canal going to cost. If the ship sub
sidy bill gets through, how much will that
bill amount to? There will be the usual
big demand for river and harbor improve
ments and public buildings, and all around
there will be a big increase in Govern
ment expenditures. Let us go slow. We
have had experience. It is much easier
to cut down public revenues than to add
to them."
Tawney thoroughly agreed with Hop
kins and was quite' as emphatic in urging
conservatism in all matters of revenue re
duction.
Similar opinions are expressed by other
returning Congressmen and already the
difficulties of even a partial reduction are
becoming apparent. The strongest pres
sure for bringing down the war taxes will
come from brewers, who will be here in
force this winter to have the tax reduced
to 60 cents a barrel. It Is also said that
whisky distillers want the tax cut down
from $1 10 to 70 cents a gallon, and they
wi!l have strong lobbies here who will
work for lessening these taxes.

with a "bunch" of the yellow metal, 'tis
said. Wyatt once tried refereelng but
says he has given it up. Al Martin, a
well-known horseman who also got hold
of considerable gold in the northern coun
try, kept him company.
Best known among the Livermore con
tingent were Lew Crellin, well known as
backer of the deceased driver. Tommy
Keating. Norman McLeod and Crellin
went on a still hunt for Ruhlin money,
but a dark lantern failed to show any up.
Constable George Secord of Napa had
among his crowd "Jack" True, Charley
Reams, Guy Young and "Billy" Cronin
of Sunol. They also paid for several
pounds of excess baggage in the way of
Jeffries money. Charley Reams' only
"kick" was that the party was not in
kinetoscope pictures.

From away up in Mendocino County
Sheriff Smith came down to Bee the two
gladiators, accompanied by Deputy Sheriff
McLaughlin, Deputy Sheriff Buchanan
and J. P. Murphy, under sheriff of Chico,
joined the men from Mendocino in the
pavilion pilgrimage. All were as tickled
at the "scrap" as a lot of Borneo head
hunters with nothing in sight.
Dixon was always a game little town,
and C. Horrigan, the cafe proprietor,
came down to pick up news for the rural
visitor to his establishment. There were
several in his party.
Under Sheriff Thomas Robinson, of Sui
sun, is a member of a half dozen gun
clubs and things of that sort, but thought
his pugilistic education needed "sprucing
up." He said he never witnessed but one
encounter before and if Gus Ruhlin is pos
sessed of good horse sense he'll stay away
from the Suisun marshes when in search
of canvasbacks.
Probably the notoriety achieved by Tom
Sharkey gave Vallejo its lirst taste of
pugilism. At any rate, a warm bunch of
sports came down from the Navy Yard
.town. Even Chief of Police Stanford laid
away his star temporarily and went out
with the boys. In fact the County of
Solano turned out a noble representation.
County Treasurer Jr.mes Keyes and
Henry Stahl of the "Vallejo News" were
very enthusiastic supporters of the husky
Angeleno.
Little Betting at Bingside.
There was no ringside wagering In

picked up a hand. He was a Jeffries man
from shoes up, but E. Scherrer and J.
Kelley Russell set 'em up on the other
alley. They fancied the chances of Ruh

a visit.
Along about 7 o'clock Marshal Charles
Holmes of Santa Rosa, in company with
Jeff Parker, was still without a ticket

Rosa was a "very pretty little city."

Something happened to her tail shaft and

VESSELS SINK
DURING STORM
Further Details of Dis
asters Along British
Coast.
LONDON, Nov. IG.â The tale of wrecks
due to the recent storms is not complete.
It has been ascertained that as many as
four vessels foundered at the mouth of
the Tyne during the storm of Wednesday
night with all hands, according to the evi
dence of the coast guards, and the wreck
age washed up. It Is feared also that a
small steamer from Ayr to Dundalk, Ire
land, had been lost with eight hands. The
body of the captain has been washed
ashore at Wlcklow. The floods caused a
big bog slide near Lisconnor, County
Clare. Much damage was done and sev
eral farmers were ruined.
The gale has been succeeded by frost
and snow of unprecedented severity so
early in the season. Ten to fifteen degrees
of frost are common, while the snow on
the northern hills is seriously impeding
railroad traffic and is causing the rivers
to overflow. Hundreds of sheep have been
drowned in the neighboring meadows. ThÂ«
lakes in the northern parks are covered
with ice.
QUEENSTOWN, Nov. 15.â The White
Star steamer Cymric, which arrived here
this morning from New York November

verse gales.
ST. JOHNS, N. F., Nov. 15.â A terrible
gale has been raging along the coast since
last night, and it is feared that many fa
talities have occurred among the fisher
men. The hulls of all the steamers which
were wrecked on the Cape Race peninsula
during the past season have been broken
to pieces and the cargoes, which were still
on board, washed away. One man who
was working on the wreck of the Swedish
steamer Vera, wrecked near Renews, Au
gust 2, was killed by a stone blown from
a cliff. Another man perished from ex
posure while crossing from the wreck
through a forest to his home.

The passengers were still clamoring for
a chance to get home, so the Hancock
was dispatched to Nagasaki on "rush"
orders. She arrived on time and the pas
sengers were again transferred and an
other start made for home.
Among seafaring men and particularly
among those who have traded in the
Orient the supposition is that the Han
cock went on a sandy beach and is prac
tically uninjured. The Japanese pilot was
in charge, but Captain Struve was un
doubtedly on deck and it must have been
some remarkable stress of weather that
drove his ship ashore.
Uncle Sam will now be short of trans
ports, and the chances are that some of
the vessels now in port and lying idle
may be requisitioned.

JEFFRIES' HftÃfl BLOWS,
Continued Page Three.
whatever and in fact scorned this
throughout the five rounds. In the sec
ond round Ruhlin landed a right to the
body as they met in the center of the
ring. They clinched and Ruhlin com
plained that Jeffries was hitting in the
breakaways and leaning on him. The
referee told him to let go and that he
would make Jeffries back away.
When they came together again Ruhlin
landed his right to the body and then
he kept away, Jeffries chasing him around
the ring. Once Ruhlin sent his right to
Jeffries' head and the crowd cheered.
This blow opened up Jeffries' sore lip
and sent a tiny stream of blood trickling
down from the corner of his mouth. Ruh
lin landed a right on the ribs and tried
to jab Jeffries with hia left, but fell short.
Jeffries rushed in and landed a right to
the body and a left to the face. Ruhlin
stumbled and nearly fell in one of hia
efforts to get away. In this round Ruhlin
scored the most blows, but they were not
effective.
Ruhlin Loses Desire to Fight.
It was evident early in the third round
that Jeffries could end the fight at any
time he wished. Mo landed several times
on the body and took all desire to tight
out of Ruhlin. One of Jeffries' great lefts
to the face sent Ruhlin staggering across
the ring, and it was only tne ropes that
kÂ«pt him from falling off the platform.
Jeffries caught Ruhlin two glancing up
percuts on the body while he was retreat
ing, and immediately afterward Ruhlin
ducked into a left which caught him flush
on the mouth. Jeffries again rushed at
him and landed two light lefts on the
face. They exchanged lefts without either
being- damaged. Ruhlin was circling
around Jeffries, but the latter quickly
stopped his movements with a left to the
jaw. When Ruhlin went to his corner it
was seen he had a nasty cut under the
right eye, which was puffed and bleeding.
in the fourth round Ruhlin was the first
to lead, trying a right to the body which
landed, but without any force behind it.
Jeffries beat a tattoo on Ruhlin's bad eye
and was all over his man. Ruhlin came
back with a right to the head and then a
heavy smash over the kidneys. Jeffries
had him in his corner #t this time and
roughed him with his elbow. Jeffries
stood and took several blows in the face
without flinching. He said afterward he
knew Ruhlin had no force in his blows;
that there was no danger. Toward the
end of the round both men took matters
rather easily. Ruhlin was still backing
away and ducked away from a left.
Jeffries caught him a hard right **nd
left to head and body, which apparently
hurt Ruhlin considerably. Ruhlin
clinched to save himself from further
punishment. Jeffries landed a right to the
head and then a hard right to the body.
He then brought his right to the body
after a pretty movement, in which ho
shifted suddenly from left to right, the
blow knocking Ruhlin down. He went to
his knees and remained down while eight
seconds were being counted off. Imme
diately after he stood up the gong sound
ed, sending them into their corners.
Madden Tosses Sponge Into Ring.
Ruhlin's seconds worked over him
assiduously, giving him smelling salts

WILL SHIP SEED
TO PHILIPPINES
Cabinet Considers Agri
cultural Needs of
Islands.
President and Advisers Also
Talk Over Some Impor
tant Appointments.
WASHINGTON, Nov> 15. -Considerable
time at the Cabinet meeting to-day was
devoted to consideration of the agricul
tural conditions in the Philippines. From
reports received at the War Department
it is evident that the vegetables grown
there are "running out," and there 13 ne
cessity for immediate distribution of new
seed. Secretary Root told the Cabinet
that not enough rice, which is the chief
staple, was grown within the islands to
supply the demand for local consump
tion.
Secretary Wilson has decided to send
one of the department's experts, with a
full corps of assistants, to the islands to
investigate the situation. Upon ascertain
ing the needs in respect to seed, the de
partment will ship to the islands such
seed as may be required. It is expected
that many things not heretofore grown
in the Philippines can be produced there.
The seed will be distributed gratis. Al
though men from the Agricultural De
partment will do the work, they will be
commissioned by the War Department for
this purpose.
The President and Cabinet also talked
over a number of appointments under tne
various departments of the Government.
Except where there is some urgent rea
son for immediate action, no appointment
is to be made until Congress meets.
It is understood that the New York col
lectorship and appraisership were not dis
cussed at the Cabinet meeting. The
President Is possibly so well versed in
these affairs that he is attending to the
New York affairs himself. The message
to Congress is practically completed, al
though on several subjects the final draft
has not been finished. It is understood
that the President will lay the situation
before Congress and call attention to the
recommendations of Secretary Gage, but
he will not make any direct suggestions.
LABOR OPPOSES
SUBSIDY BILL
Assembly of Knights Is'
Against Hanna-Payne
Measure.
INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 15.â The general
assembly of the Knights of Labor to-day
devoted most of Its afternoon session to
consideration of a resolution introduced
on Wednesday by a seaboard delegate,
denouncing the Frye-Hanna-Payne sub
sidy bill now pending In the United States
Senate.
It was bitterly opposed by six members
and was referred to a committee on legis
lation, who reported it back within an
hour unchanged, when it was adopted by
an almost unanimous vote. It is as fol
lows:
Resolved, That the development of the
American merchant marine Is greatly desired;
that we believe that American freights ought
to be carried In American bottoms, built in
American shipyards by American mechanics,
at wases commensurate with the American
standard of livinâ¢.
Resolved, That the present bill Dendinjc in
the United States Senate known as the*Frye-
Hanna-Payne subsidy bill Is not drawn in the
interests of the American shipyards nor Ameri
can laboring people, and therefore the Knights
of Labor oppose Its enactment, believing that
some measure can be and should be presented
that will encourage the building of ships by
American workmen and maintained by Ameri
can citizen seamen which should meet the ap
proval of the whole people.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions
be sent to each member of Congress by the
general secretary-treasurer.
The report of the committee on legis
lation was submitted. It says the evolu
tion now taking place in the industrial
Held through the rapid concentration of
capital has filled the working classes
with alarm for the future welfare of the i
country and declares it is time to call a I
halt on municipal. State and national
lesislation in granting further privileges
which go to fatten already large private
fortunes.
Resolutions submitted with the report
demand from Congress such legislation
as "will provide for the utmost publicity
of the affairs of all corporations conduct
ing an interstate business."
Such laws are demanded as "will pre
vent the capitalization of any corpora
tions above the amount of money actu
ally Invested, whether said investment be
in cash or plant."
The resolutions also declare that Con
gress has no right to tax all the people.
for the benefit of a few and that ':when
ever Government aid is extended to pri
vate corporations it means robbery of
te whole people."
and what proved to be the last round.
Both led and then they clinched, from
which Jeffries broke away and landed
his right over Ruhlin's heart. Ruhlin's
movements were noticeably slow after
this, his legs almost seeming to have lost
their power of locomotion. Acting under
instructions from Delaney Jeffries forced
the fighting and pegged away at Ruhlin's
body.
Ruhlin was In very bad shape. Jeffries
landed a right on the body and imme
diately after a right on the chin, which
knocked Ruhlin again to his knees. Again
he took the count of eight seconds. When
he stood up Jeffries balanced himself,
and taking heed of Delaney's orders.
"Downstairs, Jim, downstairs," kept at
Ruhlin's body. It was evident to all the
spectators that Ruhlin was directing all
his energies to lasting the round out and
avoiding a knockout. The men had been
in their corners about a hrflf-minute when
Madden tossed r. spoi>ge into the ring. It
came as a surprise to the spectators and
to Jeffries.
Opinions of Spectators.
The spectators came away from the Pa
vilion differing in opinion as to Maddens
act in throwing up the sponge and saving
Ruhlin from an Inevitable knockout in
the sixth round. Some held that, being a
championship fight, Ruhlin owed it to
himself and to his future career to have
toed the mark until the decisive blow
had been delivered and he had measured
his full length on the floor of the ring.
Others who watched the agonized play of
Maddens features after the second round
felt his interest in Ruhlin was greater
than that of merely a manager, and he
did not want him punished unnecessarily.
It was the consensus of opinion that had
Jeffries turned loose in the third round
he could have ended the fight then and
there.
The illumination for the taking of pic
tures was one of the hits of the evening.
Notwithstanding the great number of
lamps required to generate the required
light there was no heat noticeable. The
spectators at the ringside were suddenly
thrown out in bold relief when the cur
rent was turned on. It apparently had
the effect of magnifying all objects in the
immediate vicinity, each face standing out
sharply against the black background.
Complains of Soreness.
After the fight Ruhlin complained of his
body being sore from the hammering he
received. He also claimed he felt the
effects of a foul blow he received in the
third round. This was an unintentional
foul and passed unnoticed. Ruhlin's face
will carry Jeffries" trade-mark in the
form of a black eye for several days. It
is a question if Ruhlin was not slightly
overtrained, judging by his movements in
the ring. They did not show the briskness
expected from an athlete who had under
gone so careful a preparation as he did
Jeffries, on the other hand, showed him
self to be in perfect physical condition
to go any distance at any pace.
LONG REPORTS
NEEDS OF NAVY
Recommends an Increase
of Officers and New
Warships.
Secretary Also Asks That
Office of Vice Admiral
Be Revived.
m
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BURKAU, MM G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â 1n his an
nual report Secretary of the Navy John
D. Long lenews his recommendation that
the office of vice admiral be revived. He
also asks that the number of lieutenants
be increased from 300 to 350, and that the
limit of the number of junior lieutenant*
and ensigns be made 600; that the present
enlisted force be increased by 3000 men;
that the marine corps be increased by 750
men, as recommended by the general
board.
In conclusion the Secretary says:
The navy to-day is a far greater factor In
cur relations witb the world than it was be
fore thfc recent national expansion which now
includes Potto Rico, the Hawaiian Islands, the
vast area of land and sea in the PhiUppinus
and our obligations to Cuba. If we ari to
have a navy at all it must be commensurate
with these great extensions â greater In inter
national evon than ir. territorial importance.
This necessarily involves the construction of
more naval vessels, their manning, exercise
and maintenance.
The general beard, cf which the admiral la
president, recommend the lollowins increaa*
of the navy:
Four first-class battleships.
Two first-class armored cruisers.
Four picket vessels of about 660 tons trial
displacement, with a sea speed of 1J knots.
with twin screws, carrying a battery of four
C-poui:der and two Colts guns and a coniple
n.ent uf 60 officers and men.
Six sheathed and coppered seagoing gun
boats of about 10U0 tons trial displacement,
with moderate sail power, similar to the An
napolis class.
Six light-draft steel gunboats of about 800
tons trial displacement, for insular service in
the Philippines.
Six light-draft, steel gunboats of about 200
tons trial displacement, not to exceed 6 feet
draft, for insular service tn the Philippines.
Six steel sailing training ships of about 2000
tons trial displacement.
One collier of 10,000 tons cargo capacity and
a sea speed of 12 knots. i
Three thousand enlisted men, in order that
they may be enlisted and drilled In prepara
tion for the completion of the ships.
Seven hundred and fifty marines. (This num
ber needed for duty on board ship, and does
not include the necessary garrison for posts
at home and in our Insular possessions.)
An increase of 50 per cent in the number of
naval cadets now allowed by law. in order
to provide for the increase of officer* needed
for the ships recommended above.
The board on construction recommend:
Three seagoing battleships of about 16.W0
tons trial displacement.
Two armored cruisers of about 14,300 ton*
trial displacement.
Six gunboats of about 1200 tons trial displace
ment.
Six gunboats of about 600 tons trial displace
ment.
Six gunboats of about 200 tons trial displace
ment.
Two colliers) af about 15,000 tons trial dis
placement.
One repair ship of about 7500 tons trial dis
placement.
Six training ships of about 2000 tons trial
o fsplacement.
Four picket, boats of about 650 tons trial dis
placement.
Four tugboats.
All the vessels thus recommended arÂ» desir
able in the prospective and harmonious devel
opment of our naval force. A larger increase
than usual is also desirable in view of the
fact that none was made last year. Some of
the vessels above recomm*nded, however, can
better than others be omitted for the present
from the list and await appropriation here
after. Among these are the gunboats of 600
tons displacement, in case the picket boats of
similar dimensions are authorized: also the re
pair ship and a portion of each of the other
classes of smaller war vessels. The depart
ment therefore recommends:
Three first-class battleships.
Two first-class armored cruisers.
Three gunboats, each of about 1000 tons trial
displacement.
Three gninboat?. each of about 200 tons trial
displacement, for insular service.
Three picket boats, each of about 850 tons
trial displacement.
Three steel sailing training ships, each of
about 2W tons trial displacement.
One collier of about 15,000 tons trial displace
ment.
Four tvÂ« boats.
The department will submit to Congress In
December next, as directed by the last naval
appropriation bill, a general description of two
seagoing battleships and two armored cruloers.
according to which the battleships and cruisers
above recommended shnuld be built If appro
priation 13 made therefor.

THE RAIL COMBINE.
THE placing of the operation of the leading
Western railways in the hands of a combined
management, in which their stocks are merged
in a common issue, is a momentous action, the effect
of which will be watched with interest by the whole
country- There is no doubt that such an operating
system will increase dividends by its superior
economy. If it seek such increase, however, by rais
ing rates it will provoke a storm of legislation com
pared with which all of the granger and anti-railroad
legislation of the past will seem to have been pro
rail and friendly.
Ever since iB6O we have had in a smaller field just
what has now taken possession of a large field.
Prior to that time roads leading in the same direction
were not what are now called "trunk lines." They
belonged to entirely separate and often antagonistic
corporations. They had no common time schedule,
nor interchangeable checks and tickets. The rail
travel itself was a great advance in speed and com
fort upon the Concord coach, but its delays, the in
convenience of changing trains, rechecking baggage
and taking fresh tickets would not now be endured by
the traveling public. The first consolidation of link
lines into a trunk system occurred on the Chicago
and Northwestern, and its success stimulated rapid
imitation, so that when the first overland roads were
built it was the obvious intention of Congress that
the} 1 should be trunked and under one management.
When theje consolidations occurred freights and
fares became cheaper, because the many operating
staffs were consolidated into one, and the economy
of operation was bestowed upon the public.
The recent grand combination is but the extension
of the old principle of consolidation, and that its su
perior economy will at once appear we know by what
has taken place in California since the prac
tical combination into one trunk line of the
Southern Pacific and Union Pacific roads. If
the combine is contented to get its profit
out of this economy, and, as it increases, to divide it
with the patrons of the road by cheaper rates, the
popular objection to such an aggregation will be ap
peased, as it was in the case of the old consolidation
nkt iiito trunks. If the opposite result, the op
position may be soon inflamed into measures of re
s?Â«tance that will try the strength of the combined
forces. The decision of the Supreme Court affirm
ing the constitutionality of the interstate commerce
law confers wide and generous powers upon Con
gress, and their exercise in restraint of such a com
bination as this will be easier than it has proved
when brought to bear upon a large number of com
peting roads.
In addition lo the power of Congress that of the
States remains unimpaired over all State commerce.
If properly and judicially exercised this power of the
States through which the combined lines pass is of
immense force, and that it will be invoked let no man
doubt.
The men who have made this combination say that
they are business men, engaged in railroading and
not in politics. If they consider wisely and well the
business aspect of their responsibility and recognize
their community of interest with the people they will
not need to go into politics. Otherwise they will
find it impossible to keep out.

Now that nearly every State in the Union has in
some sort of fashion adopted a State flower, a move

get the National Government to adopt a Union flower
and the carnation has been suggested as a good one.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. NOVEMBER 16. 1801.
PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT.
IT is not pleasant to read that the institution of
civil government in the Philippines was prema
ture, and to have the opinion of army and navy
officers that military rule and garrison government
must be again resorted to there and be maintained for
many years to come.
It may be possible that we have forgotten that
those people regard themselves as conquered by our
superior military power, and that they have just the
same feeling about it that is common to all races
under the same circumstances.
If tbey are in this mood it is to be expected that
the}' will use any authority conferred upon- them to
reorganize resistance, and it is clearly the opinion of
our military officers that they have been doing this
ever since civil government was instituted' among
them. To hold such a vast number of people indefi
nitely under the rule of the army is to be avoided
if possible. It is more costly than civil government
and less satisfactory to our own people. It gives
less opportunity for the incidents of conquest to be
forgotten and practically suspends all training for
civil government.
It may prove to have been a mistake to treat them
as if they were of our own blood and therefore
ready to appreciate offered education, limited self
government and a prospect of larger freedom. They
have known but little of these in the past, under
Spanish rule, and have been made treacherous by
treachery.
The late convention of the Federal party held in
Manila was an encouraging sign. Maybe that atten
tion to one of its recommendations would have a
pacifying effect. It asked for an issue of $100,000,000
in bonds to repair the waste of war and help restore
the destroyed substance of the people. When we
read of the burning of all the houses in a town by
our troops we recognize it as a hard military neces
sity. But there is another side to it which will have
to be considered in all plans for the placating of the
people. The burning of three hundred houses by a
punitive expedition to admonish the people against
harboring the opponents of our arms means the de
struction of the property and the shelter of that many
families. The burning of rice fields is adopted to cut
off a military resource in the form of food, but it
means famine for non-combatants. Perhaps an hon
est inquiry into the material condition of the people,
to develop the extent to which their power to support
and feed themselves has been abridged by the neces
sities of our conquest, would be in the line of infor
mation upon which our Government could act with
a soothing effect.
Heretofore American visitors have perhaps too
mifch considered the natural resources of the islands
in the light of their profit-producing capacity for our
benefit and too little the economic condition of the
people we have conquered. There are two ways of
overcoming resistance. One is by the diplomacy and
the immediate benefits of civil government, and the
other is by the avenging military arm. The experience
of mankind is that the latter makes the beneficial use
of the former more difficult, and it must be continued
to the complete exhaustion of physical opposition by
the entire destruction of all who are capable of of
fering it. It will be better to turn public opinion in
this country away from the mere gloating over the
natural riches of the islands to the more humane task
of healing the wounds made by war and the uplifting
of the people into forgetfulness of our necessary
harshness in the greater abundance of our kindness.
No race has ever sincerely submitted to conquest
in the generation thai felt the hard hoof of the con
queror. To greatly prolong military government in
the Philippines will probably mean the rearing of
generation after generation under the exact condi
tions of conquest, by that means postponing indefi
nitely the pacification of the country. We said long
ago that the real crux of the question would appear
when we attempted civil reorganization of the isl
ands, and it is upon us. The task calls for the for
bearance, the patience and the humanity of our peo
ple. Administrations cannot do it all. Our policy,
wise or otherwise, must come up from an informed
and enlightened public opinion. No administration
took the Philippines. That was the act of the people,
and an administration merely registered their will. It
could not do otherwise. To take was easy. It was
merely a question of physical force. To hold wisely,
govern humanely and make friends of twelve millions
of conquered people is not a physical feat. It calls
for moral courage, for self-examination, for the' high
est and best conception of the characteristics of those
people that they deserve.
Our own administration needs the spread abroad
of these considerations among us, and it needs the
obvious crudescence of the public opinion which
should result.
Despite the failure of the Pan-American Exposi
tion at Buffalo and the extensive preparations making
to hold one at St. Louis, Boston is talking of raising
$10,000,000 for exposition purposes, and it would
seem that not even philosophers can profit by the
experience of others.
HUNTING DOWN THE EOERS.
GENERAL IAN HAMILTON, who left Lon
don a few days ago to act as chief of staff to
Lord Kitchener, is said to have taken Avith
him a plan prepared in* London for a more vigorous
campaign, with a view to ending the' war before the
time comes for the coronation of the King. The plan
includes a scheme for enlisting the loyalists of the
colony as a mass, the dispatch of additional cavalry
from Great Britain, and, in short, exerting the full
force of the Cape and the empire in the effort to hunt
down the Boers and terminate the struggle.
The details of the new plan to be submitted to
Kitchener by General Hamilton have of course not
been given out, but in a recent speech at Dover Mr.
Wyndham, M. P., gave an account of the process of
hunting down the Boers, which is now in practice,
and it is probable the new programme will differ
from the old only in being a little more drastic in
nature. Wyndham is quoted by the* Westmin
ster Gazette as saying: "The only plan was to hunt
down each commando by mobile column as a sleuth
hound tracked and hunted down its prey, or shut off
the enemy in other regions by groups of blockhouses
from recruiting in richer lands. The Government
held that Lord Kitchener could, and they could not,
prescribe the particular mode of operation best suited
to different districts or the subordinate general best
qualified for the work. * * * More columns,
more men and more horses would be sent out as they
were wanted, and, in fact, were being sent out to
South Africa. Irksome as the delay was, the hunt
went on, and it would not be helped by either crack
ing whips or shouting at the hounds like cockney
sportsmen. Almost each day meant a few Boers
killed and a few more captured, or a greater number
of horses, and the scent grew hotter, as was shown
by the discarded baggage of sick men and by the sick
horses which the enemy left behind in his flight."
To such a hunt Mr. Wyndham said "there can be
only one end." It would seem that he must be right.
According to recent British estimates there are nol
more than ii,qoo Boers left in the fighting column.
They are being gradually worn down by overwhelm
ing numbers, and it must be admitted that the num
bers are being urged forward with tireless energy by
Lord Kitchener. He has spared neither men nor
horses in his pursuit of the foe, and nad not the
Boer commanders been generals of high capacity as
well as stanch patriots they would long since have
been surrounded and captured.
It is announced that General Joe Wheeler is to
leave the South and make his home in Philadelphia,
and now if the citizens would organize a political re
form cavalry brigade and give him command of it
Philadelphia might be redeemed from the gang that
rules her.
SALISBURY'S SPEECH.
FOR many a year past the British public, and to
some extent the civilized- world, has carefully
noted the speeches made at the annual banquet
given by the Lord Mayor of London to the Ministers
of the crown. It has been the custom of the Minis
ters, and particularly of the Premier, to make use of
the occasion to announce to the country the policy
they intend to pursue and for which they wish popu
lar support. These addresses, therefore, have be
come-far more important than the perfunctory ad
dress of the sovereign from the throne upon the
opening of Parliament, and they are always awaited
with a good deal of interest.
At the recent Lord Mayor's banquet public expec
tation was disappointed. Lord Salisbury spoke, in
deed, at some length, but it was noted that he spoke
without vigor either in manner or in language. Ac
cording to the reports that come to us his appearance
betokened a man whose career is virtually finished
and who lags superfluous on the/political stage.
Weak as he is, however, he is none the less Prime
Minister of the British empire, the responsible head
of the administration, and the one man who can. speak
authoritatively for the Government. He renewed
his oft-repeated declaration that Great Britain will
see the war in South Africa fought to a finish by
the complete conquest of the Boers, no matter what
the cost. He pointed out that guerrilla warfare is al
ways long and tedious, but did not undertake to say
when the struggle in South Africa would be ended.
"We cannot," he said, "tell you publicly all that is
going on. We should be gravely neglecting our
duty if we did. All I can say is, and I am speaking
the judgment of those who have the best opportunity
for determining what is really going on, that we are
making month by month and week by week sure,
steady and substantial progress." He asserted that
the prolongation of the war has been due in nowise
to the lukewarmness or neglect of the Government,
and insisted that the Ministers have given to the gen
erals in the field every reinforcement they asked for.
Continuing his speech the old statesman deplored
the frequent manifestations of pessimism on the part
of his countrymen. He could not say when the war
would close nor promise a reduction of taxation, but
fty way of cheering his countrymen he reminded
them of the benefits obtained through what is known
as the concert of Europe. "In considering," he said,
"the embarrassment and difficulties in which it may
be thought our country is standing, it is a matter for
congratulation that the peace of the world has been
on the whole so little disturbed, and that we have
found a kindly feeling and such a correct attitude on
the part of all the powers with whom we have been
in alliance. I venture to say that fifty years ago that
would not have been the case."
That claim of peace maintained through the con
cert of Europe was the one word of cheer the Pre
mier gave the British public. For the rest he sought
to rally the people to his support by declaring that
the interests as well as the prestige of the empire
depend upon a successful conclusion of the war. Of
the financial burdens laid upon the taxpayers, of the
waste of war and the increase of the national debt he
said nothing. It is therefore not strange that Lord
Rosebery in speaking at Edinburgh on Thursday
evening should have said: "I would like to see an
experiment for a year of a Government formed en
tirely of business men, such, for example, as Mr. Car
negie and Sir Thomas Lipton, instead of politicians.
I ask you: Are we getting our moneys worth for
the money spent?"
If Pierpont Morgan and J. J. Hill do not look out
they will form so many combinations of railways and
steamship lines that after a while there will not be
competition enough to make life interesting to them.
THE RAINY SEASON.
BY the opening of the rainy season with good
showers in nearly all parts of the State Cali
fornia is given promise of an abundant pros
perity to follow. The experience of the dry seasons
of a few years ago is still so fresh in the minds of
the people that they are not free from fear of a repe
tition of the disaster. Warm and dry weather in the
fall would unquestionably have a depressing effect in
some quarters, but all fear of that is now dispelled,
for there are ample reasons to justify the expectation
that from this time on we shall have abundant rains
to provide for the crops of the coming year.
In more ways than one the beginning of the season
of general rains is felt beneficially throughout the
State. The showers bring a blessing to the cities as
well as to the fields. They clear the air and flush the
sewers. They give an enlivening tonic to the atmos
phere and a new vigor to all who breathe. The
freshening effect will be felt everywhere. Men and
women will move forward to the Thanksgiving sea
son with brighter faces and happier hearts. There
will be an increased activity in trade in cities, towns
and villages. A fuller confidence will be felt by the
farmers in their fields, orchards and vineyards, and,
in short, everybody will be better for the coming of
the health-giving and wealth-giving showers.
A good and prosperous season for the fruit men of
the State in the coming year will advance California
by something more than ordinary progression. For
a series of years many of them have worked against
adverse lr.ck. Years of drought were followed by
cold springs, whose frosts in many sections of the
State caused immense damage to the young fruit and
in some cases well nigh ruined the growers. This
season there is a promise of better things. We do
not have frequent droughts in California, nor a long
succession of cold springs. The prospects are there
fore excellent for all kinds of rural industry. Those
prospects have been brightened by the coming of
rains this early over such widespread portions of the
State. In the coming of the showers, therefore, we
may well feel something of a general joy. They are
a part of our Thanksgiving.

THE SUNDAY CALL, A WESTERN I
M PAPER lOR WESTERN PEOPLE.
GOSSIP FROM
LONDON WORLD
OF LETTERS
Of the trade transacted during the last
month by far the greater portion has con
sisted of 6-shilling novels.
I saw it mentioned in one daily paper
that as many as ninety new novels had
been issued in one day. That was a sen
sational figure and. though the issue has
not reached quite so many, still the out
put has been very large, and some sixty
new volumes have appeared in the fiction
line during the month of October.
A fair percentage of these have been by
authors of repute. Many of them, there
fore, commanded a ready sale.
It looks as if Rudyard Kipling's "Kirn"
bad sold mnpt freely, nearly the whole of
the first edition of 50,000 copies being dis
posed of. while its popularity has causei
an increased demand for the other works
of this author.
"The Benefactress." by the author of
"Elizabeth and Her German Garden," has
been very much in request, as also havrÂ»
"The Right of Way," by Gilbert Parker;
the "New Canterbury Tales." by Maurice
Hewlett: "The Purple Cloud." by M. P
Shiel; "The Flower and Thorn," by Miss
Beatrice Whitney, and "The Giants'
Gate," by Max Pemberton.
"The Eternal City." "The Herb of
Grace," "The History of Sir Richard Cai
mady" and "The Luck of the Vails" have
also continued in steady request.
"Light Freights," by W. "Vtt. Jacob*,
proved no exception to the customary
success of that author's humorous pro
ductions, as it has been in constant de
mand.
Prise gift books are pouring: in from
various publishing houses and works from
the pens of those prolif^ writers for
youthful minds such as G. A. Henty, G.
Manville Fenn, Dr. Gordon Stables anil
others have already begun to be sought
after.
It is said that Graham Salfour's "Lif^
of Robert Louis Stevenson" is already in
its seventh thousand. In this connection
it is perhaps worthy of note that the
Christmas number of the Pall Mall Maga
zine will contain a character sketch of
Stevenson from the pen of W. E. Henley,
who perhaps knew him better and under
stood him better than any of his contem
poraries.
Now that the woman publisher has
come on the scene, there Is a possibility
that the book trade may have to be dis
cussed before long, from the woman
po.nt of view. Women booksellers, of .
course, have long existed in London, but
mostly as dealers in second hand books.
There are two well known women book
sellers In Kensington, however, who open
ed a regular shop as an experiment about
eighteen months ago, and who have made
a great success of it. Bookselling, they
dâ¬ clare, is a delightful business for a
woman, and one in which she has every
oportunlty of excelling.
Miss Florence White, the new publisher,
begins appropriately with the home series
which she edited for Grant Richards and
which she has taken over from him. Her
imprint may also be seen on a new hand
book on smallpox.
The death of that great Chinaman LI
Hung Chang gives point to a book whi^h
Mr. Murray is just about to publish. It
is a series of anecdotes of John China
man," illustrating his character and cus
toms, and is derived from the author's
own personal experiences in China. He is
E. H. Parwer, who to now professor of
Chinese at Owens College. Manchester,
and for years was in the British consular
service in China. He has both a knowl
edge of the people and an appreciation of
them. He thinks with Sir Robert Hare
that any attempt to crush the Chinese
spirit is a mistake which will have to be
paid for in the future.

LONDON POLICE
STILL HOLD DIX
Prisoner Makes Strong
Plea to Be Released
on Bail.
Officials of United States Em
bassy Aek That He Be
Detained.
LONDON, Nov. 15.â H. St. John Dix
was brought up on remand at the Bow
street Police Court to-day, charged on a
provisional warrant with larceny com
mitted in the United States, and was
again remanded for a week. The prisoner
was represented by the Hon. Charles Rus
sell, who made a strong plea for bail on
the ground that his client was a British
subject and that he had never been nat
uralized in the United States. The offi
cials of the United States embassy op
posed the prisoner's release on bail, say
ing that papers were expdected here by
December 5.
The prosecution believes that Dixs real
name is Jenkins: that he was engaged in
literary work in America under the name
of Henry St. John, and that he subse
quently adopted the name of Dix when he
started i/i business as a banker.
Among the papers secured at the time
of the prisoner's arrest was a dishonored
draft for $3000, drawn on New York and
signed "John Bruce." The prisoner de
nied all knowledge of the draft and said
he had never seen it. It was apparently
drawn by his attorner. Bruce, with whom
he was domiciled in London.
It is alleged that EL St. John Dix ob
tained control of three banks in the State
of Washington in 1900, and that he subse
quently wrecked the Scandinavian-Ameri
can Bank at Whatcom, Wash., and dis
appeared with over $8000.
.Dix was arrested in London November
S. and was remanded after formal evi
dence of his arrest had been presented.
Some weeks previous to Dix being taken
into custody the authorities of Scotland
Yard informed the officials of the United
States embassy that Dix was available if
required. The usual inquiries were insti
tuted and the authorities at Tacoma sent
a recuest for Dixs arrest.
H. St. John Dix, or H. St. John (or Jen
kins), according to his own story related
to confidential friends at Whatcom,
Wash., is the eldest son of a British peer
raid is entitled to succeed to the peerage
on his father's death. He was one of the
principals in the ltata affair, when the
ship left the harbor of San Diego, Cal.,
during the late civil war in Chile, loaded
with munitions of war for the insurgents,
after the American Government had pro
hibited her departure. She was chased
and captured by an American warship
and St. John was thrown into prison at
Valparaiso. He was subsequently released
through the influence of the British Min
ister there.
St. John accompanied Coxey's army
from Massillon, Ohio, to Washington as
commissary general, acting at the same
time as correspondent for a Chicago pa
per.
Later St. John formed a plan for the
establishment of a string of banks to
reach from Vancouver. B. C., to San Di
ego. Cal. He borrowed $9000 from a Se
attle bank with wnich to buy a controll
ing interest in the Scandinavian-American
Bank at Whatcom, paying $3000 for the
use of the money for eight days. He
then took the deposits in the Scandina
vian-American Bank and purchased the
Bank of Blalne at Blame, Wash., and
bought the Citizens' National Bank at
Fairhaven. Wash. He also entered into
negotiations for banks in Seattle. Tacoma.
and Everett, but eventually fled, telling
his associates that he was going to get
help and that he had a $100,000 insurance
policy in London that had just matured.
GERMAN PAPER ATTACKS
CONSUL GENERAL MASON
Seriously Objects to His Reflections
on the Business Situation in
the Empire.
BERLIN. Nov. 15.â The Kreuz Zeitung
to-day makes a savage attack upon Fran
rip Mason. United States Consul General,
because in a recent consular report the
latter said the business situation in Ger
many could not regain Its former pros
perity as long as the future respecting
duties continued uncertain and the danger
of foreign reprisals remained.
In Mason's report the Kreuz Zeitung
sees a. censure of the German Government
and answers that duties in Germany arÂ«
not more uncertain than in the United
States, and that Germany is only exact
ly following the example the United
States has set in raising its duties. â¢
The paper in question concludes by
saying:
"Let the United States make and inaug
urate a tariff reform favorable to com
mercial treaties before accusing other
countries of endangering trade relations
..rough preparations for tariff legisla
tion."
REGARD LODGE'S SPEECH
A WARNING TO GERMANY
English. Press Thinks German Em
peror Will Proceed to Create a
Great Fleet.
LONDON, Nov. 15.â The Spectator,
commenting upon Senator Lodge's "very
important speech" last Saturday night in
Boston, will say to-morrow:
"Europe is in fact forbidden to acquire
even a coaling station in either of the
Americas. As Great Britain and France
already have possessions in America, it
can only refer to Germany. The warning
is to her, and it will stimulate Emperor
William's plans for creating a great
fleet."
The Outlook, reviewing the position of
the navies of the world, predicts the
United States will yet have a fleet second
only to that of Great Britain.

ROBBER SUSPECT
NOW IDENTIFIED
Proves to Be a Noted
Criminal Wanted for
Murder.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 15.â A telegram has
been received by Chief of Detectives Des
mond from Sheriff House of Concho Coun
ty, Texas, stating that the picture of
Longbai:gh, the train robber suspect held
at the Four Courts, had been identified as
that of Ben Kilpatrick, "the lone Texan"
who is wanted there for murder. Kilpat
rick escaped at Sonora last April when
Bill Carver was killed. The woman pris
oner, Laura Bullion, is also well known
there. More of the stolen Helena, Mont,
bank bills are turning up in circulation
about San Angelo.
Chief Desmond "sweated" Kilpatrick
again to-day. He acknowledged that he
had been reared in Paint Rock, Texas,
and knew Sheriff House.
"You are wanted for murder down
there," said the chief. "Now whom did
you kill?"
"I don't remember being In trouble
down there," replied the prisoner. Then
he stopped talking.
In the minds of the St. Louis police
there is no longer any doubt that the
Montana train robber suspect is Ben Kil
patrick of Paint Rock, Texas. Another let
ter containing an authentic picture of Kil
patrick was received this afternoon from
Sheriff House. The likeness between the
picture and the prisoner is unmistakable.
When the photograph was shown to the
prisoner every muscle in his body quiv
ered. He compressed his lips, but did not
say anything. _"
A telegram was received from R. B.
Kirk, the Sheriff of Ballinger County,
Texas, saying that the picture of the
supposed Longbaugh had been positively
identified there as that of Ben Kilpatrick.
SITE FOR FIiOUB MILL
SECURED IN THIS CITY
Chicago Capitalists Prepare to Take
Part in San Francisco's Indus
trial Activity.
Upon the block bounded by Kearny,
Montgomery, Chestnut and Francisco
streets the McDonald Grain and Milling
Company will erect a large flour mill
upon the expiration of a land lease next
year. The property was recently con
veyed in part through the agency of
Baldwin & Howell from Edmund K.
Scott, Alice M. Wilmot and Eva and
Charles F. Scott to the milling company
for $42,500. The sellers own an undivided
three-eighths in the land. The other five
eights are owned by Andrew B. Mc-
Creery, Peter J. Donahue and the Burke
estate. A division of the block will be
agreed upon which will give the milling
company 137:6x275 feet upon which to
build.
The expectation is that the mill will
cost about $200,000. The site is only about
200 feet from the belt railway and is prac
tically on the water front, so that it is
easily accessible to both rail and sea
transportation.
W. E. Keller, the manager of the mill
ing company, has been here recently
making the deal for the land required.
Several places were considered before the
selection was finally made. The company
is operating a large mill at Los Angeles.
The people concerned in the company are
Chicago capitalists.

POLITICAL PULL
WILL NOT AVAIL
President Annoyed by
Army Officers Seek
ing Promotion.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â 1t was an
nounced at the War Department to-day
that the names of the officers to fill the
vacancies in the grade of brigadier gen
eral will not be announced until Congress
meets, as it is not deemed desirable to
make ad interim appointments. In addi
tion to this statement and in view of the
great pressure that has been brought to
bear, it has been deemed proper to make
the following official declaration:
The Secretary of War and the President have
had Informal discussions on army matters on
several occasions and it is understood that the
President has expressed himself raost positively
on the use of political and social influence by
officers for the purpose of obtaining changes
of stations, leaves of absence, modifications of
orders, etc. Of course, It Is understood that
officers often deem it necessary to have atten
tion called to their cases by political friends
for appointments, especially cases of young
volunteer officers who have recently been ap
pointed. It is safe to say. however, that at
no period in the history of our Government
has the matter of record been used to such good
purpose as during the present reorganization of
the army, when the greatest possible care has
been taken in the selection of persons for ap
pointment to the reorganized army
The President has not hesitated' to Inform
Senators and others who have applied to him
that no officer will improve his chances by
sending his friends to annoy the President in
his behalf. On the contrary the effect which
will be produced probably will be directly op
posite to that which the candidate hopes for.
Several Senators and Representatives have
had some disappointment because the per
sons in whom they are Interested have not
received the appointments and stations applied
for by them, but the administration as a whole
is evidently of the opinion that the good sense
and Judgment of public men will lead to the
same conclusion as that arrived at by the
President and Secretary of War, that Is. if a
system of records be thoroughly established
at the War Department, showlrg the progres
sive work of officers frqm year to year. It will
be far better for the officers and men, as well
as public officials, that such a register bo
made the guide for selections, details etc.,
rather than influence. The appeals of Indi
viduals to their Congressmen for their personal
assistance in the matters above enumerated
necessitate public men giving up a great deal
of their time in locating the proper office at
which to apply for Information and the filing
of appeals. This takes them away from their
legitimate duties while Congress is in sesrion
and also interferes greatly with the public ad
ministration of the departments. It Is fully
recognized by public officials that the proper
men in the first instance to establish the char
acter of an applicant for office are the Sen
ators and Representatives from their own
home, and it is eminently just and proper that
their influence should be respected and they
should be responsible for the character of the
persons recommended for office, but once in
the public service it is only fair to the ad
ministration that not only army officers but
all other classes of public office-holders should
rely upon their own merits and not upon the
further use of political Influence.
AN INADEQUATE VERDICT
SET ASIDE IN NEW YORK
Supreme Court Justice Severely Criti
cizes Action of Jury in a
Damage Suit.
NEW YORK. Nov. 15.â Justice O'Gor
man in the Supreme Court to-day of his
own motion set aside a verdict for $300 in
favor of Julius Wiltsen, who sued the
Metropolitan Street Railway Company for
$15,000 for the death of his five-year-old
son Lawrence on the ground that such a
verdict was utterly inadequate. The ac
tion taken by Justice O'Gorman is said
to be without precedent in the New York
courts. In setting aside the verdict the
Justice said:
"The verdict rendered in this case Is so
grossly inadequate and indefensible that
it should not be allowed to stand. The
verdict is perverse and the damages arbi
trarily and capriciously fixed at such a
low figure as to shock the moral sense.
"The plaintiff is in no manner responsi
ble for this miscarriage of justice, and to
impose costs as a condition of setting the
verdict aside and granting a new trial is
to emphasize the wrong to which the jury
has already subjected him."

DARING BURGLAR
KILLS A WOMAN
Shoots Her in the Head
When She Finds Him
in Her Room.
Husband of the Victim Then
Riddles the Murderer
With Bullets.
GALENA, Kans., Nov. 16.â At Central
City, a mining camp, thirty-five miles
west of Galena, at 2 o'clock, Mrs. Kramer,
wife of a merchant, was shot dead in her
bed by Ed Watkins, a town tough, who
had" entered the house for the purpose of
robbery. Kramer then shot and killed
Watkins. Watkins had formerly been
employed by Kramer in the tatter's gen
eral store. Kramer had disposed of con
siderable property in town yesterday and
was accompanied home by Watkins. Mrs.
Kramer was awakened in the night and
found Watkins standing over her bed and
pointing a revolver at her. She managed
to exclaim, "Why, man, you wouldn't
hurt us, wouldyou." when Watkins, with
out paying heed to her plea, fired, the
ball entering Mrs. Kramer's temple and
killing her instantly. Kramer arose by
his wife's side and fired three times at
Watkins, each ball taking effect. After
Kramer's first shot Watkins called to his
partner, who was in an adjoining room,
"Ed, do your duty." Then Watkins died
without speaking another word. His pal,
whose name and identity are unknown,
escaped.
Kramer's eighteen-months-old girl was
sleeping between her father and mother
when the mother was shot.

Suicide of John W. Hummell.
John W. Hummell, an assayer recently
employed in the Union Iron Works as a
machinist, was found dead yesterday on
Ninth avenue in Golden Gate Park wth
a bullet wound in his forehead and a
pistol near his right hand. The discov
ery was made by a mushroom picker, who
notified George Ireland, a saloon-keeper,
who in turn notified the morgue officials.
In the pockets of the dead man was found
$93 10. Hummell was a widower and re
sided at 760 Harrison street. In the even
ing he attended Van der Naillen's Mining
School at 113 Fulton street. He had been
subject to epileptic fits and it is thought
that* despondency led him to make away
with himself.

ident.
Union Pacific Has One Rep
resentative in Each Class
on the Board.
NEW YORK. Nov. 15.â The directors of
the Northern Securities Company met to
day and confirmed the. election of the fol
lowing officers: President, James J. Hill;
vicfe president, John S. Kennedy; second
vice president, George F. Baker; third
vice president, D. WiUis James; fourth
vice president, W. i. dough; secretary
and treasurer, W. J. Nichols; general
counsel, W. P. Clough; executive commit
teeâthe president ex officio. chairman;
John S. Kennedy, George F. Baker, D.
Willis James, E. H. ::..rriman and W. P.
Clough.
It was announced that in audition to the
confirmation ot the election of officers
only business of a routine nature was
disposed of.
The board of tlSrectojs has been classi
fied according to ler.gtn of service, one
third of the ard going out of office each
k year, as follows:
. One yearâ Hill, George F. Baker, La
n.ont. fc-tiilman, Terhut:e.
Two yearsâ Thorno, Perkins, Schiff,
Clough.
Three yearsâ Kennedy, James, Nichols,
Bacon and Harriman.
Union Paciric interests have one repre
sentative in each cUi:js of the directors,
but the other lour of the one-year di
rectors are all representatives of the Hlil
interests. "
The Evening Post f^ys: It is not the
intention to make changes in the officers
of any of the three great railroads con
trolled by the new priprietary company.
J. J. Hill has no present intention of re
signing the Great Northern presidency.
Despite reports from Chicago that Presi
dent Harris of the Buiiington, who is now
on his way Ea?t, has resigned, it may b3
stated authoritatively that he will con
tinue as president of that company by
Hill's expressed wish, llellen will also
continue as president of the Northern Pa
ciflc, directing the operations of that
property as heretofore. While it is com
mon knowledge that Slellen antagonized
Hill when the two railways in the North
west were operated as rivals, it is known
that Hill recognizes The special capacity
of Mellon for the Northern Pacific presi
dency and the line record he has made in
that property, and is anxious for him to
remain in the presidency, and has re
quested Mellen to continue in his office.
Of the new officers, the secretary and
treasurer is secretary of the Great North
ern: the vice president is one of Hill' 3
business associates, and generally regard
ed as the largest holder of the Great
Northern railway shares; Baker, presi
dent of the First National Bank, was
Hill's most active associate in the Bur
lngton stock purchase, and Clough is vies
president of the Great Northern Railway.
James is a director of the Northern Pa
cific.
BAVARIA STANDS LOYALLY
WITH THE GEXMAN EMPIRE
Regrets Her Inability to Take Steps
in the Interest of the Brave
Boers.
MUNICH. Nov. lo.â ln the Bavarian
Chamber to-day, during the debate on the
general internal situation, there was
much criticism of the crabbidness of Ba
varia's representatives in the Dundesrath
in regard to the South African war and
In connection with domestic matters. The
Premier. Baron yon Crailsheim, in the
course of an emphatic general denial of
the allegations made declared that, how
ever regrettable, i: was irnpo^tible for
the Imperial Government to take steps
in the interest of "the brave Bbers."
It was a great advantage for Bavaria
to be a member of the German empire,
which, no more than any other great
power, could nowadays evade the worM
policy. As to the charge of Caesarism,
it was a matter for congratulation that
the Emperor took such an energetic view
of his mission. Bavaria would always
stand loyally "i ire. As to the
words attributed to the Prir.ce Regent,
'I will not allow anything to be wrung
from me." they were never uttered, for
the simple reason that no one desired to
wrins anything from Bavaria.

Only the other day an application was made by Sir Evelyn Wood for another aid de
camp. As the commander in chief was not present Secretary Brodrlclc took it upon himself to answer

Secretary of War.
Thowe who are likely to know prophesy an early outbreak in Pall Mall. The storm brewing
cannot be delayed very much longer. Dissatisfaction at the War Office is nothing new, for it is an
old story, lÂ»ut military men nay things have never been so bad as they are now.

CRUELTY CHARGE
AFTER AN OUTING
Humane Agent Accuses
Ministers of Abusing
Horses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Nov. 15.â Charges of cruelty
lo animals have been filed with the State
Humane Society against Rev. Henry A.
Buchtel, chancellor of the University of
Denver; Rev. Marvin A. Rader of Grace
Methodist Church, Denver, and several
other pastors of small churches in moun
tain towns. The charges are made ,by
residents of Eagle, Colo., from which a
parly of ministers, conducted by Rev. Air.
Gordon of that town, started last summer
on a hunting trip in the mountains. The
party was gone nearly a month. Ten
days before the others, Rev. Mr. Gordon
left the party. When the other ministers
returned to Eagle, it is said they left
their mounts tied to hitching posts outside
the station, and a few moments later
bearded the train for Denver. It is
charged when the owners came- to claim
their animals they found most of their
horses nearly famished for lack of food
and water and with backs and legs cov
ered with sores.
"We have not yet concluded our in
vestigation," said Humane Agent White
head to-night. "I have secured consider
able'evidence. Their cloth will not pro
tect the men accused."
Chancellor Buchtel denies the charge
and intimates that it is an attempt to
blackmail.
FOOD INSPECTORS MAKE
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY
Find That the Chicago Markets Have
Been Flooded With Adulterated
Honey.
CHICAGO, Nov. 15.â Glucose honey, un
der the attractive guise of "pure clover
honey," is invading the Chicago markets
to such an extent that the efforts of the
State pure food inspectors are largely di
rected toward investigations of thia im
position, says the Tribune. One entire car
load of "honey" consigned to California
was barred from the markets yesterday,
except as a plainly labeled adulteration.
The analysis of the "honey" composing
the assignment showed that it contained
from 50 to 60 per cent of glucose, and as
"pure honey the stuff was condemned.
The consignee had the choice of selling it
as a glucose mixture or of sending it back,
and he chose the latter course, at the
same time canceling other orders which
would have brought other large quanti
ties of the glucose honey to Chicago.
Unlike many of the adulterations which
flood the market, the glucose honey is not
regarded as an injurious mixture, and
the Pure Food Commissioners affirm that
the imposition on the purchaser is one
which injures his pocketbook and not his
health.
It is worth about one-fifth as much as
real honey.
BOOSEVELT FAVORS
A SCIENTIFIC TARIFF
D. O. Haynes of New York Tells of
His Interview With the Chief
Executive.
CHICAGO, Nov. 15.â D. O. Haynes of
New York, who is in Chicago to-night,
said in an interview that the published
reports of his remarks last Wednesday
evening in St. Paul about President
Roosevelt's views on tariff were incor
rect.
"Of course, I did not say that the Presi
dent gave the positive assurance that he
would make no reference to revision of
the tariff in his forthcoming message,"
Bald Haynes. "I called upon President
Roosevelt some four weeks ago to ask
him to make some reference in his mes
sage, if possible a recommendation for a
permanent tariff commission. The Presi
dent stated that he could not include this
subject in his message without discussing

OIL COMPANIES
WIN ON APPEAL
Important Opinion Is
Handed Down by
the Court.
Judges Gilbert, Morrow and Hawley,
sitting as the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, handed
down two opinions yesterday â one by
Judge Hawley, affirming the decree of the
Circuit Court in the celebrated oil land
cases entitled The Pacific Land and Im
provement Company vs. The Elwood Oil
Company, and The Cosmos Exploration
Company vs. Gray Eagle Oil Company,
and the other by Judge Gilbert, dissent
ing.
The history of the case is as follows:
On December 23, 1899, J. R. Johnston se
lected the east half of the southwest
quarter of section 4, township 29 south,
range 3S east, M. D. M., in Kern County,
consisting of eighty acres, in lieu of a
tract of eighty acres non-mineral land
included within the limits of a public for
est reservation, for which the United
States had issued to him a patent. On
April 11, 1900, Johnston conveyed this land
to the Pacific Land and Improvement
Company.
The claim of the defendants was based
upon a certain placer mining location cov
ering the southwest ciuarter of section 4
in June, 1899, by eight persons, who con
veyed their rights to the Elwood Oil Com
pany, and upon the contention that the
location by Johnston was void for the
reason that no discovery of oil or other
mineral was made until after the selec
tion by Johnston. After the lands were
se4ected by him certain of the defendants
flled a protest, alleging that the same
was mineral land, and the defendants
forcibly entered upon the property, erect
ed derricks and other machinery and pro
ceeded to extract oil.
Courts Without Jurisdiction.
The complainant asked for an injunc
tion restraining the defendants from us
ing the land. In the opinion the court
sav.s:
"We are of the opinion that the Federal
courts are without jurisdiction to entertain a
suit to determine the respective rights of the
parties to any land to which the title remains
in the United States Government in regard to
which a contest is pending in the Land De
partment between the Â»arties. An action of
ejectment cannot be maintained in the courts
of the United States on a merely equitable
title. The averments in the bill are suscep
tible of the construction that the defendants
are In possession of the land in controversy
While such a bill might be entertained In a
State ccurt. It Is not cognizal.le by a Federal
court of equity, the remedy being at law. The
general ruls is well settled that the right to a
patent once vested is treated by the Govern
ment in dealing with the public lands as
equivalent to a patent issued, and when a
patent does issue it relates back to the incep
tion of the right of the patentee. It is true
that no valid location of a mining: claim can
be made until the discovery of mineral. It
does not, however, follow that because no min
eral was found the land in question was unoc
cupied.
The possessory rights of the minerg have
been recognized by law, although in all such
cases the legal title to the land remains in the
Government. No right can be initiated on
Government land which is in the actual posses
sion of another by a forcible, fraudulent or
clandestine entry thereon.
The judgment of the Circuit Court in
both cases is affirmed, with costs.
Judge Gilbert Dissents.
Judge Gilbert, in his dissenting opinion,
says that the marking and establishing
of four corners and posting at one of
them a notice of the claim do not by
themselves give any right whatever to the
locator. Land covered by such a claim
is truly "vacant land, open to settle
ment," as is any other land of the public
domain. There is no statutory right of
possession or occupation or any other
right whatever conferred by any statute
prior to discovery, save and except the
right of exploration. The right of ex
ploration for miners upon the public do
main is but a license. It does not, prior
to discovery, constitute a legal right in
or to the land on which exploration is
made. Until discovery of the mineral the
law gives him no right whatever, except
to defend himself against the invasion of
another who has no greater right.
Spain Will Not Retrench.

Deputies to-day, by a vote of 148 to 28,

TEXAN JUSTICE
DEFIES THE LAW
Counts Himself Into Of
fice When Defeated
at the' Polls.
Issues Certificate of Election
to Himself and Retains
Seat.
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 15.â Thousands
of newspaper readers who have heard of
"the law west of the Pecos," in Texas,
v.ill be interested in learning that the lew
will be administered for the next twj
years, as it has been In the past, by
Judge Roy Bean of Langtry, Valverde
County. The result of.the recent election
in this county was brought here to-day
by Edward W. Cartlidge of Mexico City.
Bean has long been known to tourists
who pass through Southern Texas and to
newspaper readers as "the law west of
the Pecos." He presides over a saloon in
Langtry, and when the occasion demands
turns his refreshment stand into a bar
of justice and deals out justice with as
much profit to th.c house as he obtains
from his more tangible merchandise. It
is related of him that he has been known
to hold up a trainload of tourists and
collect 25 cents each from the men be
cause a, passenger on a preceding tram
had failed to pay for a bottle of beer.
On another occasion a tourist offered him
a $20 bill in exchange for a bottle of beer.
The Judge did not have the change and
as the easiest way out of the difficulty
he convened court and fined the tourist
$19 75 for contempt of court in using pro
fane language. He keeps a six-shooter
handy to enforce objectionable decisions.
The voters of Valverde County refused
to sanction such methods of dealing out
justice and the face of the returns at the
recent election showed thart Judge Bean
had been defeated by a majority of 107
votes. As soon as this information wag
brought to Langtry, the Judge convened
court and ordered his Constable to bring
in the ballots. He found that 110 fraudu
lent ballots had been counted for his op
ponent and he declared himself elected
Justice of the Peace of Valverde County
by a majority of 3 votes. He now holds
a certificate of election issued by himself
to himself, and no man has yet appeared
who is disposed to challenge his right to
hold the office.
FRENCH MINISTER OF WAS
ORDERS ARMY STORES SOLD
Finds That a "Laxge Quantity of
Canned Provisions Have Seri
ously Deteriorated.
PARIS, Nov. 15.â La Liberte to-day as
serts that two million francs' worth of
deteriorated American tinned foods have
been discovered among the military stores
at Verdun.
General Andre, the Minister of War,
has consequently ordered all tinned foods
among the army stores, whether French
or American, to be sold, on the ground
that it would be better to have no stores
at all than to depend upon canned provi
sions, which would be found to be bad at
the outbreak of war.
DEEP-LAID PLOT
TO ROB MEALEY
Consul Hanna Reports on
Celebrated Mexican
Mine Case.
DES MOINES, Nov. 15.â Philip C. Han
na, Consul General of the United States
for Northern Mexico, received the records
to-day in the celebrated Mealey case. He
is urged to act promptly, and has accord
ingly hastened them to Washington with
recommendation. He emphatically states
there is a conspiracy to persecute Mealey
and that unless the Government secures
his release at once and obtains redress
the rights of all Americans will be jeop
ardized.
Mealey was confined in a Mexican dun
geon on what he alleged was a trumped
up charge of contempt of court. He al
leges it is the result of an effort to dis
possess him of valuable mining property.
He says those contesting his title Include
prominent officials and relatives of mem
bers of the CaDinet. He alleges he was
given the alternative of signing away his
rights or imprisonment.
Sighs for Inquisition,
LONDON, Nov. 15.â Extracts from the
Chicago translation of the Bible were
published here to-day. The Evening
News comments on the work as follows:
"In Chicago even the masterpiece of liter
ature is not sacred. Twenty misguided
inhabitants have just issued a translation
of the New Testament into modern
American. Such an atrocity almost
makes one sigh for a few hours of the
inquisition."
Story of Railway Purchase Denied.
PARIS, Nov. 15.â The president of the
Compagnie Generale de Traction professes
to know nothing of the story published
in the United States that a group of
American capitalists, headed by John D.
Rockefeller and others, had practically se
cured cortrol of his company.
DALIaAS, Texas, Nov. 15. â There Â¦was a kill

Special Dispatch to Che Call*
REDDING. Nov. 15.â 1n the Bast the
name of Shasta has a glamor about it,
end many are the Eastern, people, who,
upon finding that a > relative who had
cme to this county to mine has died, im
mediately begin a quest for the fortune
cr gold mines which they presume . he
most have left. An instance of these
jyttfl for mythical fortunes has just
-it : ded hero in the marchers finding them
selves badly mistaken.
James Yearsley, an attorney of Phila
delphia, was recently retained to make
investigations in this vicinity on. behalf
of Harry W. Henderson of Norwood, Pa,,
who was appointed by numerous sup
posed heirs to inquire after the fortune
left by Thomas Glasgow Grider of Back
<-ye, Shasta County, who died several
months ago. The people represented by
Henderson are relatives of James Dia
mond, who met a tragical death in his
cabin in Uuckeye in 18S2. He was a part
ner of Grider and was believed by the
relatives to have been mulcted of his for
tur.e by Orider. Letters from Diamond.
v.rittcn in US, stating that he had
enough to last him until death, are held
Â«is evidence that the miner had ample
means. The heirs obtained their sup
posed information regarding the big for
tune left by Thomas Grider from an
liastern newspaper.
The attorney completed his Investiga
tions here yesterday. It develops that
Diamond and Grider were partners, but
that their claims at Buckeye amounted
to little. Instead cf bein? murdered. Dia
mond got out of bed in his cabin while ill
i:i ISS2, rolled into the fireplace and was
burned to death. The- climax is reached
in the discovery that Grider had dropped
his surname and that he was the Thomas
Glasgow who, instead of leaving a for
tune, died penniless three months afro at
the county pocr farm.

Abandoned.
SEATTLE. Nov. 15 âThe Times prints
the following from Valdes, Alaska: The
Â¦work on the all-American trail from this
place to the Yukon has ceased for the
winter, and there is some fear here that
it is likely to be suspended or abandoned
If Congress does not make an appropria

A roadway Is absolutely necessary' for
the opening up of the great interior of
Alaska. Through Port V aides is the only
known gateway or entrance to the inte
rior of the country that is open the en

the building of roadways would be left to
private enterprise, but this is essentially
a public work, and there is no means of
deriving any revenue therefrom except
through the work.
In the work already projected and part
ly completed under the supervision of
Major W. R, Abercroinble about $193,000
has been expendedâ sso,ooo in exploration

Less Than One Hun
dred Feet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 15.â Prom indications
and developments made in boring for oil
San Jose is destined to be in the center
of an oil district. The Orchard Crude Oil
Company, which is sinking a well on the
Main ranch, six miles west of this city,
has struck a small quantity of oil at less
than 100 feet from the surface. In going
down but 115 feet two strata of oil were
struckâ one at 60 and the other at 80 feet.
This is so encouraging that the promoters
hope to strike a gusher. Experts declare
that a good stratum of oil exists in that
locality.
Near the well now being bored oil was
found at a depth of 600 feet a few years
ago, but because of the breaking of drills
the well" had to be abandoned. That well
has now filled with oil, and the company
is pumping it out and using it for fuel
in boring the second well.
Two more wells are being sunk within
a few miles of the Main ranch.

to-day obtained farms in the Olympic for
estry reserve, following the proclamation
of the President throwing the lands open
to settlement on November 1Â». The United

suitable claims. The tract, which consists
of about 50,000 acres, is in the northern
part of Chehalis and the western part of
Jefferson counties, and contains fine tim
ber and farm lands.
No trouble ensued, as the settlers had
arranged most of their differences before

The lands were subject to any kind of
entry under existing laws, but actual set
tlers were given first preference. While
these lands might have been taken under
grants by Congrss, the State land com
missioners determined not to put in an
replication, owing to the fact that the

LOSES HIS LIFE
ON THE TRAIL
Clark Moore of Visalia
Disappears Near
Valdes.
Known to Californians in
Connection With Pursuit
of Ohris Evans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 15.â A letter fro.m Val
des, dated November 5, says: Clark
Moore, the 'silent prospector," as he was
known among his many friends in this
place, has been missing for three months
and it is generally believed that he has
met with some fatal accident or likely
succumbed to starvation. It is known
that he had no horse and when last seen
in July had only what supplies he carried
on his back.
Moore left State Creek in July for the
head waters of the Shushetna River and
no one has seen him since. His sleeping
bag, with his name written on it, was
found hanging in. a tree by some pros
pectors, who were on their way to Val
des. This was 200 miles from this place,
In a rough, wild country.
Clark Moore came here in 1898 with the
Copper River rush and has been prospect
ing along that river and Its tributaries
ever since. He seldom had a partner and
was of a quiet disposition, not given to
talking and afraid of nothing. He trav
eled alone. Moore was from Visalia, Cal.,
where he was well known. He will be
remembered in that State as the man who
visited Evans and Sontag's hiding place
in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, when
the detectives of California were looking
in vain for these train robbers. Moore
was arrested for complicity in the rob
bery, but a jury in Fresno acquitted him.
Every prospector in this locality was a
friend of Moore's and he had no enemies.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 15.-
Two carloads of the beautiful stain ?d
glass windows which are to ornament the
new Memorial Church have arrived on
the campus and will be placed in the im
mense structure by the designers, Charles
and Frederick Lamb of New York, at an
early date.
Mrs. Stanford, when seen this after
noon, said that the windows were forty
seven in number, all being life-size por
trayals of Biblical characters. Twenty
seven of them, she said, would illustrate
the life of ChriÂ«t from his birth until his
death, and the other twenty will repre
sent prominent characters in the Old Tes
tament. The color scheme in the win
dows has been so arranged as to produce
a most beautiful effect from the interior.
Mrs. Stanford is having the work on the
church hurried forward with all possible
speed in order that the edifice may be
complete and ready for dedication by
March 9. She said this afternoon that
the designers of the windows. Messrs.
Lamb, would arrive from New York next
week and would begin the work of put
ting them in their permanent locations
immediately. The windows were on ex
hibition at the Pan-American Exposition
and were the objects of great admiration
to the many visitor* there.

Bandit Not Yet Captured.
CHICO, Nov. 16.â Officers who were out
until noon to-day searching for the lone
highwayman who attempted to rob the
Chlco and "West Branch stage yesterday
afternoon returned to West Branch this
afternoon. Owing to tiie rough nature of
the country into whfth the robber fled
the officers were able to follow the trail
but a short distance. The ridge on either
side of the canyon into which the robber
retreated is closely guarded by deputies,
and if he emerges he is almost certain to
be captured.

Their Campaign Is Directed
Against Ranchers Near
'^ m - Guaymas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUSCON, Ariz.. Nov. 15.â A special from
Batomatal to El Correo de Sonora, pub
lished in Guaymas, says that Yaqul In
dians have killed Don Pedro Moreno, a
prominent rancher near Santa Maria, and
his foreman. The two men were riding
together when a shot was fired from am
bush and the foreman, fell dead from his
horse. Senor Moreno jumped from hia
horse and had no sooner touched the
ground than he, too, was shot, two
wounds belngrinflicted which, caused hi.s
death later. ThÂ© shoothig could be heard
at Santa Maria and a posse of troopers
left at once in its direction, only to find
the foreman and Senor Moreno lying mor
tally wounded. Santa Maria has a troop
of soldiers and the entire force was sent
into, the field to hunt the Indians, who
could not be found.
The Yaquis seem determined to kill the
most prominent ranchers in the valley and
their guerrilla warfare makes travel
risky.
The widow of Don Jesus Palmas has is
sued an open letter to the Government
calling for aid in suppressing the Yaquis.
Don Palmas was killed by Yaquis a few
days ago, having been shot from ambush.
General Torres is now in the field with a
troop of, cavalry and was reported to
have surrounded a large band of the In
dians.
ADVEBTISSMENTS.
lifiSsiifjjsTiiicTior
Rich and Poop Alike Suffer From
Catarrh in This Climate.
All observant physicians have noticed the
enormous Increase in catarrhal diseases
in recent years, and the most liberal and
enlightened have cheerfully given their
approval to the new internal remely,
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, as the most
successful and by far the safest "remedy
for catarrh yet produced.
One well known catarrh specialist; as
soon as he had made a thorough test of
this preparation, discarded Inhalers,
washes and sprays and now depends en-
tirely upon Stuart's Catarrh Tablets in
treating catarrh, whether in the head,
throat or stomach.
Dr. Risdell says: "In patlent3 who had
lost the sense of smell entirely and even
where the hearing has begun to be affect-
ed from catarrh I have had fine results
ifter only a few weeks' use of Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets. I can only explain their
action on the theory that the cieansins
ai.d antiseptic properties of the tablets
destroy the catarrhal germs wherever
found, because I have found the tablets
equally valuable in catarrh of the throat
and stomach as in nasal catarrh."
Dr. Estabrook says Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets are especially useful in nasal ca-
tarrh and catarrh of the throat, clearing
the membranes of mucus and speedily
overcoming the hawking, coughing and
expectorating.
Any sufferer from catarrh will find
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets will g\v3 Imme-
diate relief, and being in tablet form, and
j>lea*ant to the taste, are convenient nml
til-ways ready for use, as they can be car-
ried in the pocket and used at any time,
as they contain no poisonous drugs, but
only the cleansing antiseptic properties
of Eucalyptus bark, Guaiacol, blood root
and Hydrastin.
All druggists sell the tablets at 50 cents
for complete treatment.

FOOTPAD LOSES
HIS OVERCOAT
Well-Dressed Men Try to
Rob Bettor of His
Winnings.
Countryman Claims to Be a
Victim of Knockout
Drops.
Theothile Lavori, a Frenchman, who re
sides in Petaluma, and who came to this
city yesterday to attend the Jeffrles-Ruh
lin contest, was held up last night at the
corner of Sansome and Halleck streets by
two men who, he believes, followed him
from the ringside. The timely arrival of
Officer Fred Green saved Lavori the loss
of a considerable sum of money, the
greater portion of which he had won on
the light. The men who attempted the
hold-up were evidently not common foot
pads, as in the struggle which one of
icem had with Lavori at<the approach of
Officer Green the footpa* lost his over
coat. The garment proved to be of the
very linost and most i-xpensive material,
resembling more that worn by a prosper
ous .â¢Â¦Â¦port than the poor apparel of an or
dinary knight of th- road.
At the ringside the Frenchman had been
a liberal supporter of Champion Jeffries,
and had backed him with JlOu at 5 to 1.
In his enthusiasm over the victory of his
favorite he foolishly flashed his winnings
before the crowd. When he left the ring
side to go to his home he was followed
by two welt-dressed men. At the corner
msome and Halleck streets one of the
men struck him on the head with a beer
bottle. Â»
P.clieeman Fred Green, who saw La
vorrs plight, ran immediately to his as
icc At his approach the would-be
footpads attempted to escape, but La
vori, although of small stature, seized
the overcoat of one of the men and held
to it so tenaciously that in the struggle
it was wrenched from the wearer's body.
The police are of the opinion that the
men were of the sports that had 'â¢gone
broke ' by backing the Akron giant.
When Lavori flashed his gold in their
faces they were tempted to become foot
pads.
John Morgan, a Redding merchant, who
also came to the city to witness the
championship contest, claims to have
beer, given knockout drops and to have
been robbed of $125. He was found in
an unconscious condition on O'Farrell
street. On being searched a gold watch
and a ticket to the fight were found in
Ms pockets. When he was resuscitated
ne claimed that he had been around town
seeing things and that in the course of
events he had taken a few drinks. He
thinks that knockout drops were adminis
lruhea JÂ° hinf in the drinks and that
while he was unconscious his money was
taken from him.

SUPERB MUSIC OF "DIE WALKUERE"
HEARD BY FASHIONABLE AUDIENCE
Grau's Grand Opera Singers and Orchestra Interpret in Fine Man
ner the Wagner Story of Mortals and Immortals â Society
Will Listen This Evening to Sybil Sanderson in ?" Manon "
Blanche Partington
WHETHER it was the cast last
night, or whether "Die Walk
ure" is too essentially Wag
nerlan to suit any but the
deeply dyed-in-the-wool Wag
nerite, or whetherâas was whisperedâ
the other* "ring" up at the Pavilion
proved the stronger attraction, last
night's house for "Die Walkure" was
noticeably smaller than that of "Tann
hauser" on Thursday evening. This, too,
in spite of "Die Walkure's" comparative
novelty, for it has only once been heard
here before, last year, with the rest of
the "Ring" cycle. But, be the reason
what it may, for this apotheosis of the
genius of the great master dramatist, the
house was not by any means what it
should have been. Perhaps the people
really are pining for "The Bohemian
Girl." One never knows.
If there had not been the superb mem
ory of last year's performance of "Die
Walkure" in the way, last night's render-
Ing might have pleased more than it did.
But there was the brilliant memory of
Nordica's Brunnhilde and Van Dyck's
Siegmund, as against the virgin warrior
maid of Louise Reuss-Belce, and the
Siegmund of Dippel, and neither are at all
comparable with the first conceptions of
the roles. The Brunhilde of Reuss-Belce
promised disaster from its melodramatic
beginning, and she was almost through
out vocally inadequate in the exacting
role. In spots she showed fitness for the
part, but as a whole her performance fell
much below the required standard. Dip
pel has broadened since last year, ma
tured in voice and gained in poise. His
voice sounds young and fresh and strong,
but he has not yet the vocal or dramatic
weight necessary for the fulfilling of the
Siegmund part. ,
Still, it is a pleasing conception, and Mr.
Dippel is more nearly Siegmund this year
than he would have been last year. He is
more capable of sustained effort, has
gained strength all around, and the fine
freshness of his voice falls gratefully

TION, "DIE WALKURE," AT THE GRAND OPERA-HOUSE.
upon the ear. He acts with ample intelli
gence, though without much power, and
looks, acts and sings, in short, like a Van
Dyck In little.
Gadski, as last year, was the Sieglinde,
and though perhaps hardly roused to her
best was a tenderly beautiful figure. She
has some strong dramatic moments, as
well as an eminent gentleness, and her
voice serves her equally well in express
ing one thing or the other. Her scene wjth
Siogmund as they enter the valley where
Brunnhilde is hiding, was a gem in its
way.
Mr. Bispham's Wotan, though true to
pitch and consistent in conception, seems
to me to be of too small pattern. He
does not wholly satisfy one's notion of
the ruler of Walhalla. But it is only that
there is not enough, quite, of what Mr.
Bispham gives, not that what he gives is
not of the necessary quality. He was in
excellent form last night, and his valua
ble voice seems to find its best place )n
anything he attempts. Hunding was
splendidly sung by Mr. Blass, who invest
ed the part with a fine, somber feeling
that added much to the atmosphere.
Schumann-Heink's Fricka was just the
wonderful bit of artistry that one would
expect from the distinguished singer, and
as Waltraute she added her gorgeous note
to the chorus of the Walkure.
Wagner is at his most wonderful In the
Walkure chorus', and the nine prima
donne that it takes for Its interpretation
got all there was out of it but the last
brilliance of Brunnhilde's part as Nordica
alone can give it. But it was magnificent
even so, and the orchestra did itself
proud. Not all the conventions of ap
plause by the Wagner schedule could pre
vent a wild burst of applause after the
final triumphant shout of the warrior
maidens, both for their Berseker dithy
ramb and the tense dramatic tumult of
the orchestral accompaniment. Here the
untrammeled genius of Wagner has full
fling and with an effect unequaled In or
chestral annals. The opera was cut con
siderably, and in spite of this and Its
early beginning endod close on to mid
night. To-night Sibyl Sanderson will be
greeted by a- "sold-out" house, and the
same may be said for this afternoon's
performance of "Faust," with Sembrich
as Marguerite.
Says the Girls Robbed Him. '
Ed Collins, alias "Bull" Collins, Jerry
Daly, a bartender, Lily Johnson, alias
May Daly, alias Nellie Murphy, and Kitty
Evans were arrested last night by Ser
geants Wolfe and Shaw on suspicion of
having stolen $150 from W. Jorgensen, a
visitor from the rural regions. Lily of the
many aliases was charged with grand
larceny and the others were booked as
vagrants. They are all hard characters
and well known In City Prison circles.
Jorgensen claims that he met the girls
on Fourth street and accompanied them to
a saloon near Stevenson street. While
he was drinking Kitty's health Lily re
moved the $150 from his pocket. He dis
covered his loss and the girls fled with
the country visitor after them. Just be
fore he overtook them, however, Collins
and Daly grabbed him and held him un
til the women made good their escape.
Jorgensen then went with his story to
Captain Spillane and the sergeants round

abled to gain admission to the United

THE presentation of Wagner'f,
"Die Walkure" last evening at
the Grand Opera-house was not
listened to by as large a house as
was expected by the worshipers
of the famous German maestro. Sad to
relate, there were vacant boxes and seats
in the theater, and the memory of last
season's performance of the same opera,
before a crowded house, was vividly re
called.
Is it possible that Wagner's operas are
not as attractive a$ they were a short
year ago, or was It that the flstlc en
counter of brawny giants elsewhere af
fected the attendance at the Grand Opera
house?
Society was well to the front, however,
last night when Director Damrosch start
ed the orchestra in the weird strains of
the mythological composition and the
scene of brilliant gowns and costly gems
of the fair sex was again witnessed.
The story of the mortals and immortals
was listened to with rapt attention. The
marvelous musical recital was well worth
the price of tickets, and though it was
not up to the standard of last year, it
was voted a success by all.
Singers and Orchestra Cheered.
There were cheers last night for the
singers and for Damrosch and his orches
tra. Artists and vocalists both earned
their shares of applause. Gadskl, Reuss-
Belce, Scheff and Schumann-Heink, to
gether with Blspham, Blass and Dippel,
Interpreted the Wagner music as only
singers of absolute merit could do.
Singers and orchestra were themes of
conversation between acts. Many men
in the audience gathered in the lobby
and dozens of ladles were in the upper
promenade and they discussed the effec
tive work that had been listened to dur
ing the previous acts.
The house was not an enthusiastic one
at the start, but when the divine notea
of Gadski and Dippel closed the first
scene there were encores in number. The
same scene was repeated after the second
act. Again and again were all the sing
ers summoned to the footlights, and Dam
rosch came in for an ovation when he
was called to the stage.
The most ardent opponent of the Wag
ner school could not help but be moved
by the magnificent "Walkyre chorus "
that opened the last act. The alternate
wailing and sonorous bursts of melody
from the orchestra seemed to hold thu
audience spellbound, and a thunder of ap
plause greeted the ending of the con
certed song of the maiden messengers of
Odin as they hurled their summons to
the warriors, destined to fall in battle, to
enter the halls of Walhalla.
Audience Laughed at Magic Lantern.
The magic lantern effects showing the
Walkyres riding on the clouds were not
In harmony with the scene. The audi
ence laughed each time the pictures were
flashed on the cloth drop, and the Wag
nerltes shuddered in tiorror. It is not to
be expected that the intricate machinery
used at Bayreuth or at the Metropolitan
Opera-house in New York to carry tKe
Walkyres through the air could be
brought here by Manager Grau, but the
little magic lantern should have been
eliminated. It was a blot on the per
formance.
This afternoon "Faust" will be given,
with Sembrich, Campanari, Dippel and
De Reszke In the leading roles. To-night
Sybil Sanderson will make her first ap
pearance in "Manon," and society is
waiting expectantly to see what the Cali
fornia girl will do. "Boheme" is to be
sung to-morrow night

WORK CUT OUT
FOR THE LEAGUE
Primary Election Law
May Need Friends
in Court.
Allied Corporations Plan to
Herrinize the State
Conventions.
The Republican Primary League will
soon begin operations for the State cam
paign of 1902. The election next year will
determine who shall succeed George C.
Perkins as United States Senator and
Henry T. Gage as Governor. The chief
purpose of the Primary League 13 to en
courage good citizens to take an active
interest in public affairs, to the end that
clean, progressive government under the
auspices of the Republican party may be
secured. The league will put forth every
legitimate influence to uphold the primary
election law. The bosses are already plan
ning to knock out the law in the Supreme
Court, and thereby open the way for ap
pointment of delegates to the nominating
conventions. The Kelly-Heriin machine
gained control of the so-called Republican
I County Committee through the agency of
the boss-ridden convention that nomin
ated Asa R. Wells for Mayor, and com
placently accepted Her/ins list of Super
visors. The allied bosses secured a smash
ing defeat at the hands of the people, but
they will make a final effort to Herrinize
the Republican State Convention of IW2
through the machine committee.
The first duty of the Primary League
will be in the direction of district organ
ization. The new apportionment law goea
into effect on the first day of January
next, hence there must be complete reor
ganization of district clubs to conform to
new boundary lines. Citizens, for exam
ple, who have been active in affairs of the
Forty-first District will. find by reference
to the new apportionment that they will
belong after January 1 to the Fortieth or
Forty-second districts. Notable changes
have been made in the districts south of
Market street.
The main effort of the Primary League
will be devoted to bringing out the best
elements of citizenship in every one of
the new districts, so that creditable and
representative men may be sent to the
Legislature and State Convention. In
every district a good ticket will be put in
the field to be voted for at the primary
election. Assuming that the primary law
cannot be overthrown by the allied corpo
rations the bosses will be compelled by
the logic of events to nominate some men
of good character. The outlook for a klgii
grade State Convention is therefore
auspicious. Better men tor the Legisla
ture than the San Francisco delegation
usually presents are likely to be nomin
ated.
The league has no candidate for Gov
ernor, and no favorite for United States
Senator. The Idea of the organization Is
that representative men chosen by the
people shall have a voice In the nomina
tion of a Republican for Governor and in
the election of a Republican to the United
States Senate. It ought to be pretty well
understood by this time that the Inde
pendent Republicans, comprising a ma
jority of the voters belonging to the
party, will not accept a programme pre
pared by W, F. Herrin, Martin Kelly and
John C. Lynch.
Senator Perkins, who has a long record
of good luck in politics, seems to stand a
fair chance of re-election to the Senate,
but in his great balancing act he may trip
up when he least expects a mishap. It
is said that the Congressional delegation
is determined to make him take a stand
one way or another on the proposition to
remove John C. Lynch.
DESPERATE STRUGGLE
WITH TWO BURGLARS
Attorney Thomas Quigley Has an
Unpleasant Experience in His
Bedroom.
James Wilson, 52 years of age, and
Frank Hayes, 17, were arrested about 6
o'clock yesterday morning at 712 Kearny
street by Policeman Lycette and booked
at the City Prison on a charge of attempt
to commit burglary. The complaining wit
ness against them is Attorney Thomas
Quigley.
Quigley has a room In the house, and
about 6 o'clock he was awakened out of
his sleep. He saw the door of his room
open, and about the same time he was
startled by observing Wilson going
through his vest pockets. He jumped out
of bed and grappled with Wilson, throw
ing him through the glass door, th 2
breaking glass attracting the attention ot
the landlady. Quigley got Wilson on the
floor and commenced to choke him, while
the landlady screamed for help. Hayes
rushed to Wilson's assistance, and seizing
a chair struck Quigley on the head with
It. Quigley made for him, but he ran
into a room and locked the door.
The Central police station was notified
and Lycette appeared oil the scene and
arrested the two men. They had been
rooming in the house for three days, but
as they did not pay any rent the land
lady locked the door of their room Thurs
day night so that they could not gain an
entrance. The police are of the opinion
that Wilson has a criminal record.

WATCHFUL CLERK
SAVES JEWELRY
Rescues Valuable Stick-
Pin Prom a Clever
Thief.
The police are assiduously searching for
a clever Jewelry thief, who entered a
Geary street jewelry store yesterday aft
ernoon and attempted to purloin an ex
pensive stick pin. He was detected in the
act by a clerk, who was so overcome by
the boldness rf the attempt that he al
lowed the thief to escape after securing
a return of the jewel.
The would-be thief is described as being
tall, slender, dark corcplexloned and at
tired in a dark suit. He entered the store
as a prospective purchaser and requested
the clerk to show him some lockets and
stick pins. While examining the Jeweiry,
turning various pieces toward the light
and twisting them about after the man
ner of a connoisseur to note their great
est luster, he slipped the stick pin into
his vest pocket.
When he thought that he had the pJn
safely concealed he tuined to go, with the
remark that the Jeweiry was tpo expen
sive for him to purchase. The clerk, who
had seen the pin disappear, requested its
return. The request was immediately
complied with.
Â¦ The thief was almost overcome with
confusion, but tried to smooth matters by
asserting that it was very funny how the
pin had found its way Into his pocket.
Although the clerk failed to perceive the
wit of the situation no neglected to cap
ture the thief. The etise was at once re
ported to the police, who are now looking
Tor the suave stranger. Because of the
meagerness of the description which they
have of the man the police entertain lit
tle hope of finding him.

upon the scene juat as the man who com
mitted the crime was ready to leave and
assisted in the escape.
About 8 o'clock Miss Rose Rosset
alone in the store, when a stranger en
tered. He asked for 15 cents' worth ot
candy and after his order had been flllel
heuded out a 50-cent piece in payment
Miss Rossetti turned to the cash register
opened it and dropped the coin in. Sha
was just picking up the proper change
when her customer sprang over the coun

to prevent an outcry, held her fast
The thief, after he had transferred
about %lo in coin to his own pocket re
leased the woman and dashed out of the
store. For a moment Miss Rossetti stood
dumfounded. She was just about to give
an alarm, when another stranger came
In from the street and asked what the
matter was. Upon being told of the bold
robbery, the last stranger quickly volur
teered to pirrsue the thief and started out
Miss Rossetti trusted to him and did not
raise a cry. This clever ruse frustrated a
capture.
Sergeant Christiansen and Officer Rob

learned the girls story, but she was too
excited to give them an accurate descrip

Horses with docked tails are not wanted
by President Roosevelt, and as he is de
termined to secure horses with long tails
he Is experiencing considerable difficulty
In securing suitable animals for * his use.
The President is looking for a span of
bay geldings that have not docked tails
and which come up to the high standard
set by him. The White House stableman
has visited Baltimore and other nearby
cities In search of horses of the kind in
dicated, but he has not succeeded in find
ing them. In discussing this matter one
of the White House attaches said recent
ly: '
Any number of w>lendld horses with short
tails are to be had, but the President will not
have that kind. He is opposed to the docking
of horses', tail*, believing the practice cruel
and unnecessary. He will not indorse the fad
by driving: behind a pair of short-tailed horses.
The difficulty In finding; suitable horses -is
caused by the horse dealers themselves. A<Â«
â¢oon as they ret a first-class horse they dock |
its tail to make It a better seller. Conse
quently when a buyer demands a first-class
long-tailed horse he cannot -i*t it.

Senator Clark of Montana, who was to
add another palatial house to the already
large list of magnillcent private resi
dences In course of construction in Wash
ington, has decided to defer the matter of
building for some time yet. He has taken
the former residence of Representative
Thropp of Pennsylvania, located at 1915
Massachusetts avenue, and will make it
his home for the winter.
Senator Clark is said to have abandoned
the Idea of building an Immense apart
ment-house on Dupont circle, upon the
former site of the Stewart mansion, and
while in Europe is studying styles of
architecture suited to the size and shape
of the ground.
All of this revives the old story of the
Senator's engagement. The lease of the
Massachusetts avenue house, in the vicin
ity of the lots on Dupont circle, strength
ens both stories, and it is supposed that
the Senator, who is really a judge of
architecture, will superintend the con
struction of his' house himself.

SURGICAL OPERATIONS
Many of Them Unnecessary. Mrs.
Pinkham's Advice and Medicine
Have Saved Many Women From
the Surgeon's Knife.
Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ -
Hospitals in our great cities are sad places to visit.
Three-fourths of â¢ the patients lying on those snow-white beds are
women and girls.
Why should this be the case ?
Because they have neglected themselves.
Every one of these patients in the hospital beds had plenty of
warning. in that bearing-down- feeling, pain at the left or right of the
womb, nervous exhaustion, pain in the small of the back. All these
things are indications of an unhealthy condition of the ovaries or womb.
What a terrifying thought ! these poor souls are lying there on those
hospital beds awaiting a fearful operation.
Do not drag along at home or in your place of employment until
you are obliged to go to the hospital and submit to an examination and
possible operation. Build up the female system, cure the derangements
which have signified themselves by danger signals, and remember that
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has saved thousands of
women from the hospital. . Read the letter here published with the full
consent of the writer, and see how she escaped the knife by a faithful
reliance on Mrs. Pinkham's advice and treatment by her medicines.
If in doubt write to Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass., for free
advice ; her experience covers twenty years.

Judge Hunt Sets Judgment Aside.
Judge Hunt yesterday set aside the de
cision he rendered two weeks aga in the
suit brought by Isaac Trumbo against M.
M. Estee to recover $8000 loaned to the
Superior Judge of the Territory or" H
on a promissory note. At the time the
Judgment was given In favor of Trumbo,
Estees attorney was not present in court
arid it now transpires, according to a
number of affidavits riled yesterday, that
through a misunderstanding of a tele
phone message sent by Trumbo, by the
clerks in the office of Estees lawyers,
the legal representatives of Estee thought
that the case would not come up for m
week from the day the message was sent.
Consequently, when the matter was
brought up Trumbo's lawyers had it all
their own way. The matter will be tried
a^ain next wppk.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Hew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.â There were further
efforts by professional bears during the early
hours of to-day's stock market to renew the
decline in prices which was in lorce yesterday,
but the evidence was pretty conclusive that
the urgent gelling to realize protits was com
pleted and tVe bears renewed the covering at
Aorta which was a feature of the last hour of
yesterday's market, he demand to cover short
contracts was a considerable factor all day
in the strength of the market, but there were
evidences here and there or a renewal of the
speculation lor a rise or of buying of a sub
stantial character for reasons not disclosed.
This was notably true in the local traction
group. Metropolitan Street Railway rising 1%
and Brooklyn Transit 1%. The buying of the
Reading stocks was on a large scale and caused
sympathetic strength in most of the other coal
ers. The copper stocks made strong recoveries
to the accompaniment of p- ">rts of improving
conditions in the trade. Amalgamated Copper
was lifted over ( points and Anaconda 1%.
There was also an advance of 3>4 In American
Smelting and of nt in the preferred. The Pa
cific Coast stocks made notable recoveries from
recent heavy declines and there were points
of decided strength among the Southwestern*.
The more cheerful prospect in the money mar
ket was the dominant influence in the re
covery of stocks. The fact that no cold was
engaged for export to-morrow relieved an ap
prehension on that score. The market closed
firm at considerable net gains scattered through
the list. â¢
The railroad bond market was moderately ac
tive and irregular in its changes. Total sales.
53.275,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last rail.

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK. Nov. 15.â R. G. Duns Weekly
Review of Trade to-morrow will say: A few
months ago Injury to the corn crop aroused
fears that the railroads would be seriously
handicapped by the loss of tonnage, yet the
season of grain traffic has not only failed to
produce decreased earnings, but there is such
a scarcity of rolling stocks and motive power
that numerous industries are badly demoral
ized. In so far as these interests are con
cerned the reduction in corn freight proves a
blessing. Railway earnings in October were
1.3 per cent greater than last year and 21.2
per cent over IS9S, while those roads reporting
for the first week of November showed an
average gain of 9.8 per cent. A heavy demand
is reported throughout the country in all lead
ing lines of merchandise, while sales of winter
goods have attained normal proportions and
holiday business promises to surpass all rec
ords. In manufacturing there was never be
fore such well-sustained activity with con
tracts running nast the middle of next year
This is especially true in the case of steei
rails and many other products of iron while
in building material, felt, footwear and most
textile branches there is little prospect of
idleness. Money circulates freely, making col
lections satisfactory in most sections Bank
exchanges in New York for the week were $ S
per cent larger than a year ago and 3' 1 per
cent over 1899, while at other leadin* cities
the gains were 10.2 and 9.2 respectively
Failures for the week number 215 in the
United States, against 217 last year and 27 in
Canada, acainst 33 last year.
Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.-Bradstreefs to-mor
rcw will say:
Favorable features are still largely in the
ascendant and the current of business Is run
ning full the country, over. In some directions
Indeed, notably in the matter of forwarding of
general merchandise, grain, ore, coal, iron and
lumber, complaints of insufficient transporta
tion facilities have become more marked. Sea
sonable weather conditions East, North and
West have expanded retail trade and enlarged
reasserting orders from Jobbers. Weather
conditions at the South /lave, however net
been entirely favorable and complaints of slow
ness of collections, due to the backward cot
ton crop or the lower prices paid therefor
have been more numerous.
A favorable feature as regards this latter sit
uation, however, is the turn for the better in
prices. Following the active buying by manu
facturers some weeks ago at the East wool
has had Fustained activity at leading Eastern
and Western markets, without, however any
special gain in prices. An unfavorable feature
noted at the West is the continuance of the
drouth in parts of Kansas and Missouri, where
livestock is being rushed to market because of
insufficient water supplies.
Demand for iron end steel is heavy and near
ly all lines share In the strength. Pig iron
is active at all markets at 25 cents per ten
premium for immediate delivery. Stocks aro
smaller than a month ago. Steel billets are
also in demand and find ready sale at $28 per
ton at PittÃburg-. The rail situation Is one of
special strength, the leading Interest bÂ»ing
reported as having its output for the year
02 booked. New rail orders at Pittsburg tins
week aggregate 100.0 CO tons, and mills in that
district are sold up to next December. No
advance in the price of rails Is looked for and
railroads not already booked are not likely
to receive their quotas much before the Ihi'o
summer. The shortage of cars restricted fur
nace operations In the Central West and com
plaints of lack of motive power In addition
are heard. Some Improvement Is looked for
when the lake movement of coal and ore stops
and cars employed therein can be released. In
woolen goods the scarcity of men's overcoat
ings has .been marked and demand in this line
is active. More orders for spring delivery are
being received by the mills. .
AMde from the strength in raw cotton, the
features have been the increased strength in
such cereals as corn and oats, due to the
springing up of a better demand, some slight
firmness # in lard, a reasonable advance in but
ter and eggs and other dairy products, and
the stimulation to prices caused by close con
trol of spot supplies. Whept and also flour
have weakened, due mainly to realizing upon
the late advance, but renewed speculative in
terest is evident on every decline, and though
prices are slightly lower on the week the tone
of the market is much better than some weeks
ago.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the week
aggregate 4.983,734 bushels as against 5.469.145
bushels last week and 4,062.020 bushels in this
week last year. Wheat exports July 1 to date
(twenty weeks) aggregate 117.182.652 bushels, as
against 70,417,817 bushels last season.
Continued activity is noted in shoe manu
facturing and kindred trades. Eastern ship
ments are 19 per cent larger than the same
week a year ago and 14 per cent larger for the
season. Boston advices are that the strength
of the demand for spring goods will prevent
the usual between-seasons shut down. No
sign of overstocking is yet visible in the
leather and hide market.
Failures in the. United States for the week
agpregate 213. against 191 last week, 227 in this
week a year ago 199 in 1899 and 223 in 1898.
Canadian failures for the week number 30,
as against 35 last week and 25 in this week
a year ago.

Chicago Grain and Produce.
CHICAGO, Nov. 15.â Corn traders ignored a
heavy European situation as indicated by
lower cables at the opening and started De
cember unchanged to %c higher at 59%0 to
GOy^c. The rapidly growing strength that has
manifested itself lately in the pit began to
dominate the whole board. New arrivals are
in great demand and the presence of Kansas
City grain men here bidding for caiioad
offering^ for shipment to Kansas and Okla
homa is *a dead weight to the bear argument.
New corn was bid for far beyond the supplies
at hand, No. 4 bringing 59c to 60c and No. 3
6o_ to Clc. December advanced quickly to
60% c. At this price, however, profit-taking
was popular and prices eased off somewhat.
Toward the end 01 the- session the demand
sprang up again and December closed strong,
%@%c up, at 604@60%c.
Undoubtedly the greatest support to wheat
was the strongly bullish tendency of the corn
and oats markets. Wheat opened strong, con
sidering the weaker cable list, large receipts
md only fair clearances. Early offerings v.ere
light, the outside markets were bullish and
December, which started unchanged . at 7?4c
10 72Hc quickly sold up to 72% c. High prices
resulted in considerable liquidation, but the
market stood it well. Later reports indicating
a poor condition of the winter crop and that
ireezing weather would find the grain too
weak to live brought another advance, Decem
ber closing firm, 4c up, at 72%Â®72%c.
The bull factors in oats were the same as
they have been for the last two days, a
strong cash market and the corn advance.
December opened 4c lower, but quickly re
covered on active buying and a short demand.
Belore noon prices had passed yesterday's high
mark. May selling at 41% c, the highest price
In seven years. Selling was scattered until
high prices influenced profit-taking. Decem
ber closed, firm, %@4c higher, at 40%Â®40-%c.
Provisions were quiet with an easy tone and
a fairly steady market. January pork closed

WHEATâ Liverpool futures were weaker and j

generally unchanged.
Chicago advanced a few fractions. General
confidence In prices gave the market an up
ward tendency. Cables were disappointing, but |
were outweighed by the strong domestic situa- !
tion. The exports for the week, according to
Bradstreet's, were 4,983,000 bushels.
This market was steady as to shipping grades,
while futures were somewhat higher.

to the lack of raw Corn. The Chicago market
continues to advance, and the heavy demand
for the Southwest continues.
This market has shown no change worthy of |

insufficient to absorb them.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The Butter market continues soft under large
stocks, and receivers are making concessions
to work off the goods.
Egss remain about the same. Ranch continue
scarce, but no further advance is noted. Ar
rivals of this grade are still light, and buyers
have to pay about what sellers choose to ask.
They purchase only from hand to mouth how
ever, as the warm, moist weather and grow
ing grass tend to Increase the production.
Cheese is quoted firm, and prices are a frac
tion higher. Stocks are fair, though som*
dealers are carrying much more than others,
the distribution being very unequal at the
moment. â¢'Â¦(:"- â¢

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
Eggs are still dearer. Butter and Cheese
are unchanged, but the former is getting
cheaper in the wholesale markets.
Poultry and Game are about as quoted laÂ»t
week. The former is plentiful, while the lat

housekeeper.
The rains are finishing up the summer fruits
and summer vegetables are nearly done for as
far as the nearby product is concerned. The
southern part of the State is now beginning to
send in Green Peas and String Beans, how
ever, so there will be no break in supplies.
In meats. Hams and Bacon are a litti*

MAKES A HIT WITH
KING OF CAMBODIA
Dentist, Who Is a Graduate of the University
of California, Travels iooo Miles to Re
pair and Pull Molars of Royal Sufferer
OAKLAND* Nov. 15.â Dentist to the
King of Cambodiaâ that is the
office which an Oakland boy, an
alumnus of the University of
California, was recently commis
sioned to fill. Dr. Paul T. Carrington is
the name of the physician who was part
and parcel of the retinue of an Easter.i
potentate, and he is a son of the Rev.
John Carrington of Siam and Mrs. S. K.
Carrington of 1285 Castro street, Oak
land. He filled the office and the Kings
teeth to such a nicety that he came away
under a shower of commendations and
Â¦with a medal on his breast.
Since his graduation from the State
University in 1597 Dr. Carrington has beer,
practicing dentistry in Bangkok, the cap
ital of Siam, where he was born twenty
five years ago. American dentistry is
away ahead of anything -else in the far
East, and the doctor's services have been
mostly required by princes and princesses
during his residence there. He has an
office in a f^ncy building on the King's
highway, which an imperial edict de
mands shall be kept aflutter with flags
all the time.
Recently King Noradome of Cambodi?.,
having heard of the fame of the Ameri
can dentist and read in the papers all
about his feats of painless extraction,
dispatched an Kmbassador to make over
tures to Dr. Carrington. These negotia
tions were carried on amid an extrava
gant unwinding of red tape, at last reach
ing accomplishment with prepayment into
the hands of the United States Minister
of the fee agreed upon.
King Ncradome Suffers Much.
Penom Penh, the capital of Cambodia,
miles from Bangkok. It took Dr.
Carrington. accompanied by his brother.
Eiirtine Carrington, five days to get there
âthree days by steamer on the Gulf of
Siam and two days on the river. Dr. Car
ringtor. found King Norodome suffering
immensely from aching molars. His Ma
jesty's household was in a state of great
agitation. The King was irritable and
the servants hung on his words, fearful
of his wrath. They had tried every means
to alleviate his shooting pain.?. The
French and the Chinese dentists had
failed in their attempts to supply him
with imitation teeth. Those fitted by the
Frenchman were held with a lot of
springs, so that when the royal sufferer
talked they bounded out of his mouth or
sometimes held his ja\*.;s so he could not
close them. Those furnished by the Chi
namen were composed of ivory from the
tusks of the elephants, and they wobbled

;.used by his failure to send money
to his absent son. On the contrary, Mr.
Noggl' had supplied the young man with
money, and on the day he ended his lif<;
had sent him a draft. It is believed that
young N aggie's deed was brought about
by mental aberration due to the use of
drugs to which he became addicted after
taking them for medicinal purposes.
The funeral will be held Sunday after

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1901.
GRADUATE OF UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA DENTAL DEPART
MENT WHO REPAIRED TEETH
OF CAMBODIA'S KING.
bo much that they gave the King a lan
tcrn-.iawed aspect. They also tied the
King's head up in poultices to reduce the
swelling, but these only succeeded in
making the martyr monarch the harder
to get along with.
Dr. Carrington's first duty was to re
move all of King Noradome's aching teeth
âa feat which gave his Royal Highness
a great deal of pleasure. The few that
were left he drilled and filled with gold
and the vacant places he supplied with
false molars and incisors. He also sup
plied him with black substitutes. The
white teeth the King exhibits when he is
in the company of white people, but when
he gets among his own race he changes
them to black. It is part of the religion
of the Cambodians to wear sable teeth,
lhat is why they chew the betel nut con
stantly. Use of the nut from childhood
puts a polish on the teeth like burnished
ebony, but It also destroys the gums, and
half the population is toothless before it
la o" years old.
During Dr. Carrington's professional
visit he was the guest of King Noradomo
In his palace. He was pretty much of a
king himself and when his employer be
gan to feel a little better they used to go
driving together in the royal coach and
four.
The King was very much impressed
with Dr. Carrington's brother and wanted
to retain him as his private secretary,
bul business engagements prevented. At
the end of two months Dr. Carrington's
mission was fulfilled. Just before his de
parture King Noradome gave a feast and
theatrical performance in his honor, when
there were great things going on. The
King wept on the doctor's neck and pre
sented him with a badge resembling the
emblem of the French Legion of Honor,
which he now wears on his breast. Each
of the brothers was given a golden cigar
holder at this royal entertainment and
thanked effusively for their many kind
nesses.
Writing to his mother of the methods
employed by Chinese, who up to a few
yean ago were the only dentists of the
Orient, Dr. Carrington says that they are
mest crude, though ingenious, and the
sufferings of the patient are most intense.
He says further:
The Cambodians are very fond of short, even
teeth ntid will suffer much to have them so.
although nature sÂ«ems to have Intended other
wise. For this operation the patient is placed
in a reclining position, a small block of wood
being U62d as a bite block. The operator then
proceeds -with a coarse mechanic's tile to
shorten the anterior teeth, apparently not be
ing particular about wounding the patient's
mouth. If the teeth prove to be too hard for
the flle a saw is then used and with painful
destruction of the teeth and soft parts. The
operator knows nothing about nerves, but sim
ply thinks of the 30 cents (Mexican) which 's
to be his fee for the operationâ lf satisfactory
to the patient. This minor operation is com
pleted in about two hours. Resardless the
Cambodians endure this operation, while they
shrink from the extraction of a loose tooth.
Dr. Carrincton is still a member of
King Noradome's staff and he is under
contract to again travel the expanse of
1000 miles whenever his Majesty's teeth
begin to ache too hard.
PARTIES TO VENDETTA

George and Mike Caldarella and
George Orlando Have Cases
Continued.
Three of the participants in the vendet

family appeared in Judge Cabaniss' court
yesterday on the charge of assault to
murder. They were George and Mike Cal

the Receiving Hospital are doubtful of his
recovery. Frank Manginl, who started
the shooting at the Roylance Brass
Works, is still at large, but the police ex

TRAVEL THROUGH
DRIFTS OF SNOW
Hard Journey With Bod
ies of W. C. Giles
and Wife.
Sixteen Miners Carry Their
Charre4 Remains Over
Trails.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 15.
Through deep snowdrifts and over rough
mountain trails sixteen men carried the
chaired bodies of Mr. and Mrs. W. C.
Giles from the scene of the unfortunate
fatality at the Dingce mines to the rail
road station at Cisco, fifteen miles dis
tant. The party arrived there this after
noon in charge of Edward McGary, sec
retary of the Contra Costa W r ater Com
pany and an intimate friend of Mr. and
Mrs. Giles.
At Cisco the bodies were shipped to this
city, arriving here late to-night. The
journey out from the mines was fraught
with much difficulty. The miners had to
plow through the drifts and by sheer
strength pack the heavy boxes which
formed the temporary caskets containing
the unrecognizable remains of the mine
superintendent and his wife, who met so
frightful a death.
The road from the mine was little more
than a mountain trail, rendered the more
unsafe because of the piling snow. It was
a journey of many hours, but thanks to
the sturdy men who had volunteered their
services, it was accomplished without ac
cident.
Friends of the deceased couple had
made all arrangements for the funeral
services,' which will be held at -11 o'clock
to-morrow morning from the parlors of
Henry Evers, Washington street, near
Seventh. The Rev. E. R. Dille, pastor of
the First Methodist Church, will officiate.
The interment will be in Mountain View
Cemetery.
IORCES CORONER TO
TAKE CHARGE OF CASE
Health Department Secures Investi
gation Into Causes of a
Woman's Death.
OAKLAND, Nov. 15.â Because of a re
port that suspicious circumstances sur
rounded th# death of Mrs. Mary E. Van
Wye the Health Department refused to
isfcue a burial permit until an autopsy
had been held under direction of the Cor
oner. A certificate of death had been
signed by Dr. J. C. Stout, who attended
Mrs. Van Wye, and the cause of death
there set forth had been indorsed by Dr.
John B'earn, who assisted during the wo
man's last illness. The postmortem ex
amination verified the physicians' declara
tions and set at rest the reports which
reached the Health Office.
The action of the Health Department
forces Coroner Mehrmann to hold an in
quest, but the burial permit was issued
this morning after that official had re
ported the result of the autopsy.
The funeral services, which it had been
feared would be interfered with because
of the Health Department's action, were
regularly conducted this morning from
Thirteenth-street parlors, the Rev. J. K.
McLean officiating. Oakland Lodge No.
18 of Rebekahs had charge of the ser
vices. The inquest will be held to-mor
row evening. Friends of Mrs. Van Wye
are trying to trace the source of the re
ports which gave them so much annoy
ance in their preparations for the last
rites. ""
ESTORES FUBNITUBE TO
A DESERTED WOMAN
Mrs. Grace Clement Secures Return
of Household Wares Her Husband
Surreptitiously Sold.
OAKLAND. Nov. 15.â Police Judge
Smith to-day restored to Mrs. Grace
Clement furniture and other household
effects which her husband had sold to a
second-hand dealer, disappearing with
the money. The distressed wife told a
story of suffering and hardship due to the
dissipation of her husband, to whom she
had been married twenty years.
After a long separation she had agreed
to his return. During his absence Mrs.
Clement, with the assistance of her two
sons, had earned enough to pay for a
modest stock of household necessities.
These had been installed in a cottage* at
C 64 East Eighteenth street. D. L. Clem
ent, the husband, went there during his
wife's absence and removed the goods,
selling them for 535. Mrs. Clement and
the two children with her were left with
out a blanket to cover them.
In ordering the furniture returned
Judge Smith explained to Mrs. Sarah Ja
cobs, the dealer who purchased them,
that she could swear to a warrant for
Clement's arrest, as he had no claim to
the wares, which had been purchased
with his wife's separate money.
ABBOTT WORTH ONLY

mony â Jacobsens and Others
Separated by Divorce.
OAKLAND, Nov. 15 âClyde E. Abbott,
who is being sued by his wife, Maud B.
Abbott, for divorce on the ground of cru
elty, testified in Judge Greene's court to
day that all the money he had in the
world was 75 o.ents. He was being inter
rogated as to his financial standing, his
wife having had him summoned to an
swer a motion for alimony. Mrs. Ab
bott's attorneys attempted to show that
he had transferred li<s interests in a
Berkeley stationery score to his mother
to avoid his wife's importunities, but he
said he never owned any real interest in
it. Mrs. Abbott asks for $40 a month and
attorney's fees. The inquiry will go on
to-morrow.

cobsen a divorce from Jacob Jacobsen on
the ground of cruelty. The couple had

other.

and Algernon Hall frun Lillian Hall, the
ground in each case being desertion.

MARIAN'S TUMBLE FROM HER COUCH
STARTLES THE SLEEPING HOUSEHOLD
Former Boss Servant Girl in Horne,of George H. Bew, Aiameda So
ciety Leader, Meets Erstwhile Employer on Common Footing
in Police Court and Denies Special Fondness for Yin Pasteur
ALAMEDA, Nov. 15.â "When our
first servant fell out of bed
Wednesday night the house shook
as if it had been struck by a run
away Kansas cyclone," testified
George H. Bew in Judge Morris' court to
day during the trial of Miss Marian
Campbell, who two weeks ago reigned as
dictator in the culinary department of the
Bew residence and who was finally ar
rested on a charge of disturbing the peace
of her employer.
It was during an argument between Mr.
Bew and Miss Campbell about wages that
the alleged disturbance occurred. The
Bews are leaders in the social sets of
this city and Oakland, and their appear
ance in the dingy court room of the local
Justice of the Peace attracted much at
tention. Mr. Bew is a pioneer Of Alameda,
having been for many years in the drug
business here.
"How do you know that it was the first
servant girl, this defendant, and not the
second girl that tumbled out of bed and
rattled your domicile?" asked Howard K.
James, the lawyer who represented Miss
Campbell.
"Well," replied Bew, "I know that there
was only one person under the roof that
could jar my residence and my family so
and that was the boss servant girl.
Whether she had a nightmare or a pipe
dream I am not sure, but I am quite posi
tive that she took a tumble to herself
because she was woozy from doses and
overdoses of â¢my choice Yin Pasteur,
which she had smuggled out of my cel
lar."
"Yin Pasteur! Why. Mr. Bew, you know
yourself that my favorite tonic is claret;
I wouldn't taste that dark brown stuff of
yours," excitedly exclaimed Miss Camp
bell, before Bailiff Brown and Judge Mor
ris could put the vocal brakes on the de
fendant.

METEORS SHOOT
ATHWART SKIES
Brilliant Shower of Leo
nids Is Seen From
Mount Lowe.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 15.â The follow
ing description of the shower of leonids,
as seen from Mount Lowe, is furnished
by Edgar L. Larkin, director of the
Mount Lowe observatory:
The first meteor was seen at 11:55
o'clock, and during the five minutes to
midnight four were seen, and 653 from
midnight to 5:40 o'clock Friday morning.
They all seemed to emerge from within
the sickle of the zodiacal constellation
Leo. None were actually seen to come
out of It, but their bright tracks prolonged
backward would converge there. Many
were of great brilliancyâ many times
brighter than Venus, the brightest planet,
now evening planet. They were all white
but thirteen, which were white, tinged
with red, and two quite red. About half
left long, luminous streaks, which re
mained from half a minute to the un
usual length of twenty-four minutes.
Meteor No. 229 was perhaps the bright
est that passed the zenith. It was re
markable in brilliancy and width of trail.
Its solid portions were dissipated with
cosmic dust by friction against the air,
and therefore did not explode. The
streamer was persistent, because very
wide bent over the west like the letter F,
the top of the F separating from the up
right and drifting toward the Hyades.
The meteor vanished into the trail midÂ«
way between Orion and Taurus. The dis*
ruption of the glowing stream was at the
star P. Oronis. The detached mass moved
to Aldebaran, eight degrees, where it be
came faint and disappeared in the bril
liancy of that first magnitude sun. The
original portion remained visible to the
unaided eye for twenty-four minutes, and
still longer in an opera glass.
Just before the time of rising the spec
troscope was arranged and the mirror of
the heliostat set to secure spectra of the
meteors as they emerged from their cen
ter. But disappointment was in store,
for not one meteor came "head on," that
is in a straight line from their point in
space of radiation. So the opportunity of
a lifetime was lost, for astrophysicists
have long sought the spectrum of a
meteor.
Licensed to Marry.
OAKLAND, Nov. 15 âLicenses to marry
were issued to-day to Joseph Mendoza,
aged 21 years, and Mary Travassl, 18,
both of San Lorenzo: Henry Murphy, 27.
and Charlotte Harder, 20, both of West
Berkeley. _
of the night everybody woke up to sleep
no more," continued Bew. "In the morn
ing I went upstairs and inspected the
room. It resembled the site of a lyddite
explosion. The place was a total wreck.
That settled me as far as Miss Campbell
was concerned, and I decided to give ncr
the grand bounce then and there. Later,
when we were trying to reach an agree
ment over money matters, she flew off
the handSe and used my telephone to call
the police* to arrest me in my own house.
That was too much for one man an-l I
had her ai -rested."
"Marian simply didn't know how to
cook ye*terv.lay morning. It was awful."
said Mrs. Bew. with an emphatic sigh, as
she stepped down from the witness stand.
Charged B"er With Yin Pasteur.
Miss Anna B'oche, second girl for the
Bews, testified for her employers and
against Miss Campbell.
I am certain, that I didn't fall out of
bed Wednesday xiight." said she. "When
Marian came downstairs in the morning
she acted funny queer. She hooked
on to the carpet cleaner and began to
chase it round antl round the kitchen in
circles. I saw she -was not right and car
ried her upstairs niter she had tried to
cook* the breakfast put her to bed.
I tied a towel arou^tl her heaa and put
hot bottles to her fee<, and she fell into a
peaceful doze. About half-past 1 in t'ae
afternoon she came downstairs and went
poking around to find a bottle she hi.d
hidden under the buiTec in the dining
room. Then she met Mr. Bew."
"I drink nothing stronaer than claret,"
answered Miss Campbe.U in reply to s.
question from Barrister James. "It was
my custom to take a glasas every evening:
at 8:15 for my nervous s.vi'tem. I nev*"
indulge in Yin Pasteur. I ii d not fall out
of bed Wednesday night, as Mr. Bew said
I did. Anna did not carry' me upstairs,
and put me to bed Thurstiiy morning,
and I think it is real mean >f her to aay
so after I had given her some of my
wine. I did not spoil the col tee nor burn
the hot cakes. The trouble lieÂ«tween Mr.
BANK EMPLOYES
STEAL BIG SUM
Williamsburg Institution
Looted to Extent of
$60,000.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.â Defalcations'
amounting, it is claimed, to $88,000 have
been discovered in the* accounts of the
Williamsburg Savings Bank, an institu
tion conducted at Williamsburg, Brook
lyn. General J. V. Meserole. president of
the bank, is authority for the statement
that the persons implicated in the affair
are Harry E. Corbett, a former paying
teller of the bank, who died November 2,
and George Zolleinhofer, a receiving tel
ler, who, it is alleged, gave the first in
formation leading to the discovery.
The bank is fully protected, it is said,
by the bonds of both Corbett and Zoliein
hofer. Harry E. Corbett had been in the
employ of tne bank for eighteen years.
He was looked upon as a' man of exem
plary habits and not the slightest sus
picion attached to him up to the time of
his death.
According to General Meserole on Fri
day of last week George Zolleinhofer, one
of the receiving tellers, went to Cashier
William Burns and confessed to him that
he (Zolleinhofer) and Corbett had for the
past two or three years taken funds from
the institution for the purposes ol stock
gambling, and that so far as he could
estimate the amount that had been lost
was between 150,000 and $60,000. Cashier
Burns had Zolleinhofer repeat his confes
sion to President Meserole and a meeting
of the trustees of the bank followed.
The examination was not concluded that
day, nor is it yet concluded, but irregu
larities enough were found to show that
Zolleinhofer had not exaggerated the ex
tent of the defalcations.
Zolleinhofer, after making his confes
sion, placed himself in the hands of the
trust comaanies and is aiding them in
their investigation of the books. He was,
with one exception, the oldest employe
of the bank, having been with the insti
tution for thirty-three years. He is 60
years of age. Corbett died in his apart
ment in Brooklyn of pneumonia on No
vember 2. He and his wife were highly
respected. The depositors are in no dan
ger, a3 the bank has a surplus of over
$8,000,000 above the deposits of $40,000,U00.
So far as could be learned to-day Zollein
hofer had not been arrested, and it is
understood that he will merely be kept
under surveillance while he is aiding the
bank to untangle its accounts.
The most careful sailors are said to be I
the most wieckless.

He charged me with six bottles of Vta

Miss Campbell was found guilty, but

Twelve members of the crew of the Al

yesterday went back to get the few re

OCTOBER EXPORTS REACH HIGHEST
FIGURE IN HISTORY OF THIS PORT
Custom-House Records Tell Startling Story of Increase in San Fran
cisco's Foreign Trade, of Her Invasion of New Markets and
of. Her Growing Imporance as a Great D stribu:ing Center
The total foreign exports from San Francisco for the month of October, iÃpp, including
exports to the Hawaiian Islands, amounted to $2,654,910. The total foreign exports for October,
1901, cxdusii'c of exports to the Hawaiian Islands, amounted to $4,903,567. Exports to the
Hawaiian Islands now average about $1,500,000 monthly. The Custom-house records show this
to be the banner month in the history of the port and also demonstrate San Francisco's growing
importance as a distributing center.
CONGRESSMAN LOUD said the
other evening that the inaugura
tion cf trans-continental railroad
communication and its subse
quent development had cost San
Francisco its position as the distributing
oict for the entire West. There is a
long, narrow book in the custody of the
auditor of the United States customs at
this port which, without contradicting the
Congressman, shows San Francisco a dis
tributing point such as few realize, even
of those actively concerned in its busi
ness development.
Ear. Francisco's right to the title "Queen
of the Pacific " is in that book, written
plainly and distinctly. It tells of San
Francisco no longer the sea port of a
stretch of inland territory, but as one of
the great sea pcrts of the world, the dis
tributing center for a territory covering
all the ports and islands of the Pacific
and reaching to the interiors of Austra
lia, Russia. China, Japan and even South
Africa. 4 , ,
juung the last few years there has
been a steady increase of foreign exports,
but it is only of late that the Custom
house officials have realized the enormous
growth of the business going out to tn-2
whole world from this port.
October was the banner month of tne
ports history. The long, narrow book of
the auditor tells this much, but does not
tell the whole story. Included in the for
eign export figures there is nothing of the
trade with the Hawaiian Islands, whicn
amounts to over a million dollars every
m The exports which go to make up the
grand total for October are very general

in nature. There is no phenomenal in
crease in any one product. A careful re
view of the items shows simply a strong,
healthy increase of all the exports and a
reaching out for new fields which prom
ise an endless development for. the trade
at the port.
The long, narrow book contains noth
ing but figures systematically arranged
in columns. It makes interesting reading,
however, and tells a tale of San Fran
cisco's growing importance in the econ
omy of the commercial world full of good
cheer to all whose interests are bound up
in the welloeing of the port.
In October, 1599, the total foreign ex
ports, including those to the Hawaiian
islands, were $2,654,970.
During the October just passed the to
tal exports, excluding nearly $1,500,000 to
the Hawaiian Islands, were $4,003,567.
During the present month the exports
have been heavy enough to insure an
equally good showing for November.
Everybody connected with the export de
partment "of the Custom House is work
ing overtime and realizing, by the piling
up of export documents, that this port is
passing through a stage of rapid but
healthy growth which will soon call for
an increase in the Custom House force.
The most substantial item^ of export
during October are breadstuffs to the
value of over $2,000,000; canned salmon,
about $1,000,000; canned fruits, $52,000, and
manufactured cloths over $300,000.
It is the location of the markets to
which the exports were consigned, how
ever, which tells of San Francisco's grow
ing importance as a distributing center.
Into some of the fields this port goes as
the rival of long established distributors,
some of the fields have been her own for
years, but many of them are new fields,
cap.ible of almost unbounded development

Kngland and Ireland took nearly
*2,000,000 of last month's exports and Brit
ish Columbia 578,455. Exports to the Chi
nese Empire, Russian China, Hongkong,
Japan, Korea and Asiatic Russia amount
ed to over $1,000,000. Nearly $600,000 was
distributed in Costa Kica, Guatemala,
Honduias, Nicaragua, Salvador, Mexico,
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In
British Australasia, British Oceanica,
French Oceanica and German Oceanica a
market was found for over $720,000. Little
Guam, received about $SOOO, Pago Pago
$154S and the Philippines over $70,000. To
British South Africa there was sent in
October exports to the value of $41,U0u and
to Portuguese South Afnca just $204,755.
Trade with South America is still in its
infancy, while Russian China, Korea and
Asiatic Russia are comparatively virgin
fields. The islands of the Pacific are all
capable of development into important
markets. Capital is turning toward them
and as they grow in prosperity so will
they add to the prosperity of that point
most central in their line of communica
tion with the outside world.
The long, narrow book in the auditor's
office is neither a monument to the book

tell of importance achieved and promises
of future prosperity to which no limit can
be lixed.
New steamers are being built for the
trade of this coast, new combinations of
capital "formed to handle and develop it
and the waterway between the Golden

DANGERS THAT
MENACE SOCIETY
Plain Duty of Man Is to
Correct Evils That
Exist.
Interesting Lecture by Rabbi
Voorsanger at Temple
Emanu-El.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger delivered an in
structive lecture at the Temple Emanu-El
on Sutter street last night, his subject
being the dangers that menace society,
and the duty of men to correct existing
evils. In his preface he alluded to the
war of the Vendee in France in 1792,
which necessarily brought into play' the
national characteristics of the revolution
ists. It was then that Danton cried out
in the National Assembly when he sought
to restore peace, "'Let my name be blight
ed, so that my country may be free!"
Rabbi Voorsanger said in part:
It was this remark which made Danton fa
mous. There are characters wno sought fame
through the commission of infamous acts, and
who gained infamy instead. Was not the as
sassin of our martyred President actuated by
a similar motive? He sought fame and won in
famy. Now that his monstrous crime has been
expiated, it might be well for us to pause and
consider in how iar existing conditions are re
sponsible for this crime which piunged a nation
into grief. It is the duty of the pulpit, the
platform, the press and Congress Itself to de
termine whether we are not Individually and
collectively responsible for this crime against
the constitution of the United States.
It Is a matter of serious doubt if our edu
cational systems are complete. Good and evil
are two mighty 1 actors which are constantly
operating in society. This is the best Govern
ment in the world because it is the most demo
cratic; and yet, while we believe this and con
demn in unsparlnsr terms assaults upon this
great man, we should delve beneath the sur
lace and ascertain the cause of discontent if
any exist, and which we know exists. We
should find out If the people are unhappy, and
why. It is to this apathy to existing conditions
we too often display that these periodical out
bursts of individual hatred for the representa
tives of the nations of the world are mainly
due.
Tne speaker expressed the conviction
that men should learn to know each other
better. He discussed the question of ad
vancement of the world on religious,
moral, intellectual and industrial lines. All
great movements not based on sound mo
rality must necessarily fail. The well be
ing of society and of the world was best
subserved by a strict adherence to moral
and religious laws in all the movements
projected by man.

RUSSELL WILL CONTHTUE
AS SUPERVISORS' CLERK
Judiciary Committee Places His Ap
plication for Leave of Absence
on Pile.
The Supervisors' Judiciary Committee
yesterday recommended the placing on
file of the application of John A. Russell,
dork of the Board of Supervisors, for a
six months' leave of absence. Edgar
Painter addressed the committee and
urged that the leave be not granted, but
that the application be placed on file.
Painter argued that Mr. Russell's sick
ness was legal cause for absence and that
no formal permit was necessary.
The committee was of the opinion that
the board has no power to grant a leave
of absence with salary. In vle"w of the I
long and faithful service of Mr. Russell, |
he will be allowed to retain his position
during his temporary disability.
The committee referred to the City At
tcrr.ey the proposed ordinance fixing at
$2 50 the daily wages of employes of the
Park Commission and those on any public
utility that may hereafter be acquired.
Tho official's opinion is desired on the
point whether the Board of Supervisors
has the power to fix the compensation of
such employes.
The bill providing for the appointment
of a Board of Examining Engineers to
license engineers of portable and station
ery engines was reported against, as the
charter does not provide for such a board
A new bill will be drafted so as to place
the power in the Board of Public Works,
which will employ one or two examining
engineers for the purpose, the City At
torney to pass on its validity.

GRIEF-STRICKEN
BOY ENDS LIFE
Antone Revezzani Could
Not Endure His
Sorrow.
For seven months Antone Revezzani, a.
17-year-old boy, grieved for his mother
who was dead. Yesterday his sorrow be
came too great a burden for him to bear
and he hanged himself.
Revezzanl's body was discovered sus
pended to a piece of water-pipe that iuns
across the top of a hallway in his home
at 4H Union place. Life had been extinct
10- some minutes. A handkerchief con
cealed the features, giving evidence of
the delicacy of feeling with which the
lonely boy prepared for fiis tragic act.
Last April Mrs. Revezzani becama ill
and after two weeks of suffering sne died.
During her sickness she was faithfuily
attenaed by her son. The boy. when the
end came, seemed to lose all interest in
his associates anrt his labor and since
has been moody and melancholy. Many
times he has expressed a desire to die,
saying that he had nothing on earth to
live for since his mother passed away.
Last evening he ate his supper with his
father During the meal he was particu
larly downcast, but the father, appre
hending no serious results, left him. and
went down town.
Young Revezzani then made his final
arrangements. He dragged an ash bar
rel directly under the pipe and stood
upon it. Then he fastened a clothes line
over the pipe and about his neck. These
things being done he kicked the barrel
aside. The force of the fall was so
great as to break his neck.
UNIVERSITY GRADUATES
FOBM BUCKET BRIGADE
With Aid of Fire Department They
Extinguish Blaze in Their
Lodging-House.
A blaze In the lodging-house called
"The Abbey," at 711 Taylor street, owned
by Miss A. C. Howe, did damage yester
day to the extent of $150. The fire was
caused by the defective pipe of a heating
stove located in the back portion of the
house and was discovered by Fred Healy,
who immediately turned in an alarm.
The occupants of the house are mostly
university graduates. They immediately
organized a bucket brigade, headed by
the Chinese cook.
The blaze had gained some headway be
fore the arrival of the fire engines, but
all the furniture had been removed from
the room. A well-directed stream of
water put out the ftre in short order, but
not before considerable woodwork was
burned. Among those who performed gal
lant service in saving the effects were
H. Edward Greenfield, Algernon Poet
Charles Hillyer, Peter George, James
Beattie and Thomas Siemen.
