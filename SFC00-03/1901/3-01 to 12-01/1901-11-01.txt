WARLIKE PLANS OF FRANCE IN ORDERING CAILLARD'S SQUADRON TO TURKEY
APPEAR TO BE MODIFIED BY SUDDEN RETURN OF THE VESSELS TO TOULON
PARIS, Oct. 31. â Late to-night the following dispatch was received from Toulon: "The complete Mediterranean squadron returned to Toulon this evening and anchored in the roadstead." This would include Admiral
Caillard's division, whose departure has thus either been countermanded or postponed. If the dispatch be correct, it would imply that the Government has received news from Constantinople since morning, which has not
yet been divulged, and which has induced a change of plan. \
It is reported that Admiral Caillard has been ordered to cruise within reach of a dispatch boat to-day for further instructions, and it is significant that the torpedo-boat Hallebardo left Toulon at full speed
during the afternoon to rejoin the squadron.
A dispatch from Toulon to the Figaro confirms the report of the return of the entire squadron, arit] adds that Admiral Caiilard's division is still held in readiness to sail at a moment's notice. Editorially the
Figaro and other morning papers express surprise at this perplexing and unexplained move after the dispatch of Admiral Caillard to the Levant has been officially announced. The Marseilles correspondent of the Matin says
the return was due to the fact that the squadron was supplied with only two days' rations.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
XV., WASHINGTON. Oct. 31.â Despite
the efforts of the American officials and ;
missionaries to convince the brigands
holding Miss Stone captive that it is im
possible to raise a ransom of 5110,000, the
latter have thus far declined to reduce
their demand by a single dollar.
While this is a discouraging feature of
â¢ he Stone case, the fact that negotiations

Jean legation at Constantinople has been
advised that there is no likelihood of any
considerable addition being made to the
simount collected. Through missionaries
â¢irho are in communication with the brig
ands this information has been conveyed
to them. It was stated by a high official
to-day that the Turkish Government has
Ijiven assurances that until Miss Stone is
liberated no military movement will be
made against the brigands.
Turkey Now Explaining.
In connection with the explanation of
Â¦:he Sublime Porte cabled to-day from
Constantinople that it is not responsible
for the abduction of Miss Stone the au
thorities say that the question of the
responsibility of either Turkey or Bul
garia has not been fully determined and
they reiterate that the collection of evi
dence to support a claim for reparation
will not be prosecuted until Miss Stone
has secured her freedom. Â¦
At this moment the view of the officials
Is that while Miss Stone was seized on
Turkish territory the brigands who ef
fected her capture are Bulgarians, and a
â¢ suspicion is entertained that behind the
brigands were the Macedonian committfe
and Bulgaria. It is this suspicion that
is responsible for the belief at one time
prevailing that Miss Stone's release would
be secured without the payment of a ran
eom, the political motive â of stirring
up trouble between the United States and
Turkey â been productive of no re-

Companion Reported Dead.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 31â is
again rumored that Mme. Tsilk, the com
panion of Miss Stone, and her child Cborn
since her capture by the brigands) are
dead.
The Turkish Government is preparing
to resist the anticipated demand of the
United States for the repayment of the
ransom necessary to secure the release
of Miss Ellen M. Stone. The Porte re
pudiates all responsibility for the kidnap
ing of Miss Stone, and maintains that the
United States has no claim against Tur
key, and that, therefore, the latter is
Justified in refusing to recoup the United
States for the money expended in her
rescue.
Claims Will Be Resisted.
A high Turkish official said this morning
â¢that the Turkish resistance of any claims
â¢would be based upon the contentions, first,
that Miss Stone, although warned of the
dangers of the road, persisted In travel
ling; second, that she did not notify the
authorities of her intention, in order to
obtain an escort, which precaution even
â¢he foreign Consuls always take when
â¢traveling in such outlying, insecure dis
tricts of the empire, and third, that the
'brigands who kidnaped Miss Stone and

WARSHIPS ARE UNDER SEALED INSTRUCTIONS TO BOMBARD
IF THE SULTAN RESISTS COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS RECEIPTS
PARIS, Oct. 31.â The officials of the
Foreign Office confirm the report
that a squadron of the French
Mediterranean fleet, composed of
three battleships and two cruisers,
under the command of Admiral Caillard,
has proceeded from Toulon to the Levant
to make a naval demonstration against
Turkey.
A Foreign Office official, in communicat
ing the foregoing, said:
"The squadron sailed with sealed or
ders and proceeds first to a Greek port,
the island of Syria, I think, where the
admiral will receive definite instructions
as to carrying out his sealed orders. I
am not at liberty to say what the sealed
orders avii btit the seizure of customs at
Smyrna would be a very effective way of
convincing- the Sultan that France's pa
tience is exhausted and that we have de
cided to enforce an immediate settlement
of the Turkish Government's engage
ments. We, however, are very hopeful
that the Sultan will not compel us to go
to that extreme.
Would Have to Bombard.
"Our squadron will not reach the Greek
port before Sunday. The Turkish Gov
ernment has thus still three days' grace
and we trust in the meantime to receive
complete satisfaction. We have act^d
very considerately toward Turkey, hoping
up to the last moment that she would
carry out her engagements, and It Is only
now, when we find that there is no serious
inaication of her doing so, that we have
reluctantly resolved to put stronger pres
sure to bear in the shape of a naval dem
onstration. It is now two months since
the French Embassador, M. Constans, left
Constantinople. His departure failed to
produce the desired effect. On the con
trary, even the Tubini question, which
was settled by the Sultan's irade, remains
unadjusted.
"The internal situation in the Turkish
empire deterred us for some time from
taking drastic measures to enforce our
demands; but the dignity of France could
not permit the present state of affairs to
be prolonged indefinitely. We sincerely
hope the Sultan will fully appreciate the
fact that we cannot any longer be trifled

with and relieve us from taking further
steps to safeguard our interests."
The official was asked what would hap
pen in the event of the French squadron
being ordered to seize the customs and if
the Turkish authorities resisted, and he
replied:
"That is a very unlikely contingency,
but if it occurs I suppose we shall have
to. bombard that port. We do not want
bloodshed, -and I do not believe there will
be any occasion for it."
France Upheld by Russia.
The decision to make a naval demon
stration against Turkish ports was taken
at a meeting of the Cabinet Tuesday at
which M. Delcasse, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, explained the Sultan's
procrastination regarding the French de
mands.
Admiral Gaillard's squadron consists of
the armcred cruisers Admiral Pothuaw,
Chanzy and La Touche-Treville, the sec
ond-class cruisers Dv Chayla and Cassard
and the third-class cruiser Gallilee. The
crews aggregate 2286 men, but the vessels
will also carry landing parties.
The newspapers approve the Govern
ment's â¢decision. The Journal dcs Debats
says:
"Every one at Constantinople and the
other capitals must be aware that France
and Russia are completely in accord in
this matter. Under these circumstances it
is difficult to believe that the Ottoman
Government will not come to its senses
and, recognizing Its error before it is too
late, relieve us of the necessity of using
other means than those of diplomacy and
courteous discussion."
La Liberte remarks that the fact that
Admiral Galllard has embarked 2000
marines is a warning to the Porte that
France will not stop before a slight show
of resistance, but will go to the end, even
though war should ensue.
Germany Strictly Neutral.
BERLIN, Oct. SI.â A diplomatist said
to-day in regard to France's naval demon
stration In the East:
"Germany will observe a 6trictly neu

stration takes place. In view of the pow

The press Is still very reserved In its

doubts as to whether the opening up of
the Eastern question will be .agreeable to
Russia at the present moment. The

WASHINGTON. Oct. 81.â M. Margerie,
the charge d'affaires of the French em

Secretary Hay this afternoon, after which
the Secretary left at once for the White
House. Mr. Margerie may be considered
an expert in matters pertaining to the
Levant, having spent several years at
Constantinople recently as an attache of
the French embassy. He feels confident
that there is not the slightest danger of
a dissolution of the concordat owing to

to the concordat understand the situation
perfectly, and in fact most of them have
grievances and claims themselves like the
French complaints, so they may look with
complacency upon the effort to make the
Porte meet its obligations. There also is
precedent for this action, for a few years
ago a French vessel seized a Turkish port
in the Guif of Alexandria and held it un

did not cause protest by the other powers
or even attract much attention.

CALL BUREAU. 1106 G STREET. N.
TV.. WASHINGTON. Oct. 31.â Whether ,
because of a desire to seek refuge in the
United States or in order to carry out a
plot formed in Europe, a notorious an
archist named Jaffei, charged by Italy
with being an accessory to the murder of
King Humbert, is now on his way to this
country-
Official information in regard to the
plans of this man was received by the
State Department, and Commissioner Gen
1 eral of Immigration Powderly, In com
! pllanee with a request of Secretary Hay,
! Jpmafl instructions this afternoon to all -
immigration officers to detain Jaffei
should he appear at any of the ports at
which they are stationed. Jaffei would
be excluded if he applies for admission
i and the steamer bringing him here will
Â¦ be compelled to return him to the port
from which he sailed.
Will Exclude Jaffei.
Secretary Hay's request contemplating
the exclusion of Jaffei is based upon an
official report sent him by the American
'. embassy in Rome. This report states
i that "Italian anarchist Jaffei started for
! Antwerp September 7 from Milan and
' will probably go to the United States."
'Â¦ This description of Jaffei accompanied the
message: Â¦â¢*"
"Jaffei, who was a member of. the
Guardie Flnanze in Rome, a body of men
corresponding to customs guards, deserted
the service and went to Switzerland. He
is said to be a violent anarchist. The
Italian Government found among the ef
fects of Brescl a letter from Jaffei and
demanded his extradition for complicity in
the murder of King Humbert. Switzerland
surrendered Jaffei on the understanding
that he should not be tried on a charge of
desertion, but only on a charge of com
plicity in the assassination of the King.
His trial occurred, but he was not con
victed and the Italian Government di
rected that hebe sent out of the country."
Instructions to Officers.
The facts contained in the report of the
embassy as given above were telegraphed
by Powderly to all immigration officials
with instructions "to keep a careful look
out for the said Jaffei in order that any
possible* violation of law may be pre
vented by his exclusion."

PLAIN BUSINESS ISSUES OF MUNICIPAL CAMPAIGN LAID BEFORE THE PEOPLE
IN ABLE SPEECHES BY MAN WHO PLEDGES HIMSELF TO HONEST ADMINISTRATION
TOBIN PUTS IN STRENUOUS DAY
AND NIGHT AMONG THE VOTERS
AND EASILY HOLDS FIRST PLACE
Candidate Is Received With Expressions of Con
fidence and His Election Seems to Be Accepted
as a Foregone Conclusion in All the Districts
/ OSEPH S. TOBIN last night addressed meetings of citizens
tS of five Assembly distrkts. Wherever he appeared the courtesy
of a crowded hall and the compliment of rousing cheers
greeted him. He confined his speeches strictly to the issues of the
campaign. He laid stress on the fact that the selection of civic offi
cials should have nothing to do with politics, that municipal govern
ment was a business proposition and that upon property-owners
rested the responsibility of selecting business men to administer civic
affairs. Although the candidate for Mayor yesterday went
through a particularly trying day from both the mental and the phy
sical standpoint, he was as vigorous after his last speech as when
he started out early in the day to visit Butchertown.
JOSEPH S. TOBIN put In last night
about the hardest work of his cam
paign. He addressed meeting's In
the Thirtieth, Thirty-second, Thir
ty-third. Thirty-fifth and Thirty
sixth districts. After he delivered his
last speech, which was at Sixth and
Shipley streets about 11 o'clock, the can
didate for Mayor was apparently as fresh
as when he started. Wherever he spoke
he was well received; whatever he said
was in the same frank, vigorous strain
that has distinguished all .his utterances.
His round of meetings last night was in.
the nature of a triumphal procession, and
wherever he appeared all the signs told
of Joseph S. Tobin, next Mayor of San
Francisco.
Tobin spent the whole day in Butcher
town, and was there treated with all the
distinction due the choice of the people
for chief magistrate.
His first meeting last night was at
Wackenruder Hall on Bernal Heights. He
was greeted by a large delegation of citi
zens of the Thirty-fifth District, and when
he commenced to speak the . hall was
crowded to its full capacity. Â¦ .
At the close of his address, in which he
reviewed the issues of the campaign, he
hurried to Maennerbund Hall, Twenty
fourth street and Potrero avenue. This
audience was gathered from the Thirty
second and Thirty-third districts. When
Tobin essayed to speak a small body of
leather-lunged young men tried to raise
a cheer for Schmitz. The cheer was
given, but was answered with a Tobin
cheer which was still echoing through the
hall when he commenced to speak. When
he concluded somebody remarked, "Whc
is Schmitz, anyhow?" Tobin spoke .as
follows:
Mr. Chairman, ladles and gentlemen: Let us
get right down and talk business. What is
the Issue in th's campaign? What do we rep
resent? What does our party represent? What
record have they given to guarantee their good
faith? Are you property holders, are you citi
zens, do you pay taxes? Then let us talk to
you. You are the men that we want, to talk
to. We stand upon our record. There It 16.
We stand upon our platform. You have read it.
Stands Upon the Record. \ , :
We stand upon the fact that we have -on
fronted every corporation in San Francisco
and done our duty. We stand upon the fact
that we have lowered your taxes to the lowest
notch ever experienced in the city of .- San
Francisco. (Applause.) We etand upon Â¦ the
fact that we have given you the lowest water
rate that you householders have ever paid be
fore in your history. We stand upon the fact
that we have given you the lowest gas rate
that you have ever paid In your history. (Ap
plause.) We stand upon the fact that we have
lighted our streets better and cheaper than
they have ever been lighted in the history of
San Francisco. (Applause.) We stand upon
the fact, gentlemen, that we have cleaned the
City Hall. We stand upon the fact that we
have cleaned your parks. We stand upon tha
fact that we have given you an honest, decent,
economical administration, and what in heav
en* name can any taxpayer demand more?
(Applause.)
We do not come now before you to cast
aspersions upon any man or to discuss the
personnel of any ticket. I have met them and
they are all good men and honest men as far
as I know. But that is not the question, gen
tlemen. You have got your money invested
here; you own a house or you pay taxes or*
your money goes into the City Hall every half
a year and goes there for a purpose. Who is
going to handle that money? Who has handled
it in the ;>ast with honesty, economy and effi
ciency? That is the question, gentlemen. (Ap
plause.) This is not a question of economics;
this Is not a Question of politics: this is a
question of business. These men that I am
addressing now are American citizens who un
derstand their riehts and understand the law
and understand the fact that they are taxpay
ers and that the men they elect must be hon
est, must be experienced, must be independent.
And where can we look for those men ' upon
the other tickets offered us? I have nothing
to say, I repeat, about the personal repute of
any man. I have treated them fairly and I
expect the came treatment from them, and
no doubt I will tret it. (Applause.)
Question of Business.
But what I say is, gentlemen, that this is
not a Question of politics. This is not a ques
tion of political economy. This is a question
of business. Who are the men that have dis
charged their duty honestly? Where are they?
Upon what ticket are they? Who are the hon
est Supervisors? For the first time in the
history of San Francisco they sat in the City
Hall and did their duty well by you-rmet the
water company, met the gag company; met the
railroad company and discussed openly, hon
estly and considerately and moderately with
them their demands and then did â¢heir duty
by the people with no hands behind their
backs. (Applause.) Â¦ â¢;"'-
Gentlemen, when some years ago this coun
try stood before the nations of the world on
trial, etpod there a young, vigorous, as yet
untried democracy before the strained eyes of
Europe waiting the hour of trial, when for the
first time in its history In modern years the
rape of battle was thrown at its feet, and
r^hen tre President called upon the citizens
to Jump forward, spring to their feet and grasp
their arms, did he say "Democrats, Republi
cans, labor unionists" or anybody else? No.
he eaid "citizens." Now, gentlemen, I say
that to you. The duty is be-fore you Just as
It confronted the whole nation then. Your
duty is to defend the city of San Francisco
r-gainst corporate aggression, corporate greed,
corporate debauchery, and, gentlemen, the duty
rests heavily upon you now. You cannot stop
to discuss political economy. You cannot stop
to discuss questions of whether a man Is a
Democrat or a Republican or a Labor Unionist.
The only question for you to discuss now Is
Â«-hat men have shown you in the past that
they are Independent of corporations, that they
knew their duty and that they will discharge
it as they find It. (Applause.)
Honesty Is What Is Wanted.
Every* man in this audience that pays his
taxes must calmly, considerately, conscien
tiously weigh in his mind that question. What
party in the past ha* done the best by you?
What men have discharged their duty honestly
In office? After all, gentlemen, all you want
in political life In . San Francisco, aa far as
thÂ« municipal government Is concerned. is hon
esty. You want to know that if you go to the
City Hall you will get a fair deal them. You
want to know that if your taxes are paid there
they will be dealt out honestly. You want to
know that every man that Is in there is as good
as his bond, and, gentlemen, let me tell you
that as honest, patriotic, independent, far-see
ing, practical business men the enly guarantee
that you can find of such a character is In the
record that is laid before you. And now, gen
tlemen, we point to our record and ask you to
Judge us by that and cast your vote by the
record that we have made. I thank you gen
tlemen. (Applause.)
SPEAKS ON" BEBNAL HEIGHTS.
ToMn Declares That Issue of Cam
paign. Is Non-Partisan.
From Twenty-fourth and Potrero a
rapid trip was made to Bernal Heights,
â¢where Twin Peaks Hall was Jammed to
Its full capacity with voters of the Thir
ty-sixth District. Tobin's address was as
follows:
Mr Chairman ladles and gentlemen: The
lewue that I have thus far presented In this
campaign I have endeavored to confine within
buÂ»inese lines. We bÂ»vo said, and we shall
maintain it to the end, that there is no other
question concerning the citizens of San Fran
cisco than an honest, economical, independent
administration of the city government We
do not contend, ladies and gentlemen, that
there cannot be found upon the other tickets
men of independent, honest and patriotic chai
acter. We do not contend that all these quali
ties can be found solely upon the Democratic
ticket, but we do contend that the record that
the Democratic party offers to you at this time
entitles them to an Indorsement of their ad
ministration.
As taxpayers we ask you to look at our rec
ord. We say as men who pay their taxes in
San Francisco, who own their own homesteads,
who have their money inveEted in savings
banks, that the only question for them to con
sider at this time Is where can we look for
an honest, independent, economical adminis
tration of the city's affairs? This, ladies and
Kentlemen, is not a partisan Issue. There is
neither Democracy nor Republicanism nor
labor unionism in cleaning the streets, in im
proving the sanitation, in keeping the City
Hall in proper condition. These things can be
performed ar.d will be performed as they have
been in the past by the same officials who dur
ing the last two years have performed them,
if we re-elect them to office.
We do not come here and say to you elect
us because we are Republicans or because
we are Democrats or for any other similar
reason. We offer you our record. We say
we have lowered your taxes; every man who,
at the end of six monthe, goes to the window of
the Tax Collector and gets his bill will find
it lower by Just bo many dollars and cents
than It was last year. Who has done this?
Who Is responsible for this reduction in. your
taxation? The men who have acted honestly,
decently, cleanly in public llfÂ«, who have eom
pelied the corporations to pay their just share
of the taxes, who have lowered the water rates,
who have dealt honestly by the city in every
respect, those men have done this for you. And
as men possessing that characteristic of Ameri
cans which If prominent, "fair play," what is
now your duty to those men who have discharged
honestly their duties of public office? Gentle
men, all over the United States to-day there .
Is prominently a disposition, in all the large
cities for clean, honest, independent civil gov
erment. Men of learning, of independence of
character, have come together and have deter
mined that, putting aside all partisan Ideas, 1 "
their whole aim, as citizens, shall be to have a
clean administration of city affairs. We have
given you this during the past two year*.
Our record has been absolutely clean. We
have done all that wa possibly could do. And
no.w, g-antlemen, â¢?Â» home before you for an
indorsement of that record. I can quote you
figure upon figure of the condition of the City
Hall before we entered It and as it stands at
the present time. Let me call your attention
to one fact alone. The city formerly paid to
the Spring Valley Water Company for its hy
drants that you pee on every corner $220,000 per
ypfir. The present Board of Supervisors cut
that down to $SO.OOO. The city now pays for
it? hydrants $80,000, effecting n. saving to the
city of $140,000. which has bee.j set apart for
the improvement of its streets and for the im
provement of its parks. Is It any wonder,
therefore, Â¦ gentlemen, that at this time
we are confronted with the opposition of cor
porations, with the opposition of corporate in
fluence in politics, with the opposition of men
who make their money as go-betweens between
the city and corporations who would corrupt
the city officials?
Gentlemen, the strength of the opposition at
this time is based upon the fact that behind
them are banded corporate aggression, corpor
ate debauchery, dishonest bosses and all the
evil influences that heretofore have been a
blight upon the city of San Francisco. There
is only one question, gentlemen. Where can
you find the honest men who have given you
a guarantee of good faith in the future? We
ask you to study our record, and in the light
of that record to cast your vote, and if you
do that as taxpayers, as practical business men
who have their money invested in San Fran
ciFfo and who would see to it that their taxes
which they pay are honestly administered, you
can vote for but one ticket, and that Is the
Democratic ticket. I thank you. (Applause.)

peared and its greeting was as warm and
significant a tribute to his popularity as
any candidate could wish. No other can
didates appeared at the meeting. Colonel
T. F. Barry performed the remarkable
feat of talking for two and a half hours
and was still on his feet when Tobin ar
rived.
"When the cheers of greeting had sub
sided the candidate for Mayor spoke as
follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: I want to
thank all you gentlemen for waiting here so
long, but It has not been my fault. I have
been going around town and visiting all points
of the city and it has delayed me until this
late hour.
The issue in this campaign has been present
ed here so often and by so many speakers it
is hardly necessary to refer to it again at this
time. The proposition is, gentlemen, what has
the present city government done for the peo
ple In this part of town that we should re
turn here now and claim your vote? I want to
read to you the ordinances that have been
passed by the Board of Supervisors and in re
turn for that we ask you now at this time
before casting your votes to consider what we
have done for you. We have fixed the wages
of Janitors in the City Hall at $2 50 per day.
This was passed unanimously by the present
Board of Supervisors. (Applause.) We have
fixed the Allied Printing Trades' stamp to all
stationery as a guarantee of fair hours and
wage?. This was done unanimously by the
present .Board of Supervisors. We have en
forced the cight-bour law of the charter on
all city work, and on all sub-contracts. This
was done by the present Board of Supervisors.
We have, at the request of organized labor,
permitted street advertising by the labor unions
for the reason that the unions could not af
ford newspaper rates. We have fixed the rate
of car fare for Bchool children at 24 cents.
This was done by the present Board of Su
pervisors.
Now, gentlemen, aa a counter balance for
that, as an off-set to that, what has either of
the other parties done for you? What ordi
nance have they passedâ placed upon the books
that In any way benefits any laboring man?
In what way have they alleviated, as far as
statutory law is concerned, the condition of one
laboring man in San Francisco to-day? We
point to our record. We show you what we have
done. We do not simply say we will do this
we promise to do thisâ but we say we have done
this. That is the difference, gentlemen. Re
member it. (Applause.) And, gentlemen, we
have not one set of arguments for this part of
town and one set of arguments for another
part of town. We have represented the entire
city of San Francisco. The taxes that have
been collected have been collected south of Mar
ket street as well as north of Market street
and, in the distribution of those taxes, south oT
Market street has shared just as fairly as north
of Market streM. We have placed south of

We have decreased the water rates south of

more deeply interested. For that reason The Call has pre
pared to give the most complete and speedy returns.
we have done throughout the balance of the
this is-Hbt a sectional Issue; this
is not a class issue; this is an issue of good
citizenship. Every man that pays taxes In
the city and county, of San Francisco to-da>
is interested in putting honest, independent, ex
perienced men in the City Hall. (Applause.)
I ask c.cry man when he goes to the window
of the Tax Collector at the end of this month
or the beginning of next month to get his tax
bill to look into the difference between his
taxes this year and his taxes last year. His
taxes will be lower this year than he has ever
paid before. That difference, in dollars and
cents represents clean government. Bt repre
sents' honesty in public life. It represents in
dependence and, gentlemen, that is what we
want. We do not care about Republicanism or
Democracy or labor unionism as an issue. What
we want are facts. What have they done for
us? Gentlemen, I refer you to your tax bill.
Consider that. That is a tangible fact upon
which you can base a reasonable conclusion and
by which you may be guided in casting your
vote.
After all gentlemen, there Is nothing In
volved in this election In the way of political
economy or anything of that sort. It Is sim
ply a matter of each man taking care of his
own house and seeing that his own house is
kept in order and thereby and judging there
from and reasoning therefrom that the en
tire city is kept in order, that the streets are
kept clean: that the taxes are lowered; that
the corporations get as much as is coming o
them and not a cent more.
That is all, gentlemen. Let us not talk
about anything else. Let us Judge this thing
as business men, as taxpayers, as men who
are interested In the welfare of the city. Let
us look at it plainly, honestly, generally. We
do not want to talk about Reoubllcan princi
ples and Democratic principles and all that
sort of thing. It is not Involved in this elec
tion at all. Why, gentlemen, the only reason
that we have an election at all is to Improve
the condition of the city; to put good men in
office And if you elect a man simply because
he has the label of an old party, what is the
use of having an election? You want to get
Â»r>od mÂ«*n in office, honest men In office â men
that you know will not be subject to bribes
by corooratlons and cannot be controlled by
bosses. (Applause.) '
Gentlemen, I want to talk to you Just as I
have talked to everybody else In thlÃ city
whom I have met. I have endeavored to im
press upon them that this is neither a per
sonal 'issue nor a political issue nor a time
for anybody to gratify any personal animosity
that he may have against another. It is a
time simply for men to say, "Now, here, who
is eoine to do the work of the city honestly
and conscientiously if he gets in the City
Hall?" That Is the only question, gentlemen.
What is going to be done with the money that
I. put in the City Hall In the shape of taxes
in the coming twelve months? This is the only
question, gentlemen. Let uÂ« not talk of any
thing else and get off on all sorts of questions
of political economy, labor unionism and the
like.
After all It is a question of what is going
to be done with your money when it is put In
the hands of the city for the coming twenty
four months. What guarantee have you got
that when you turn over your taxes to the
city your money that Is received by the
city will be distributed for the benefit of every
man in this audience? Let us get dowiLto that
finally and ultimately, because that is^he only
question to be decided. If the nominees upon
the Republican ticket or the Labor Union ticket
can give you a guarantee as sound, as rea
sonable, as unanswerable as that given you
by the Democratic ticket that they will dis
charge their duties as well and that they have
the experience to discharge them well, that
they understand municipal government, that
they have had an experience in municipal gov
ernment, that they are not subject to cor
porate control, then I say to you "vote for
the nominees of the Republican or the Labor
Union ticket as the case may be." But, gentle
men, if looking over the record of the Demo
cratic party for the last few years, if, taking
into consideration as property-owners and as
taxpayers and as license payers, no matter
in what shape the money is paid to the city,
if, looking over the record of the past two
years, you are confronted with the fact that
the taxes are lower, the water rates are lower,
the gas rates are lower, the City Hall Is
cleaner, the streets are better paved, the
streets are better lighted and cleaned, the la
boring man is better paid in the service of
the city, the laboring man has received fair
treatment at the hands of the city in the
shape of wages and hours, city contracts are
performed and regulated by the rates of labor
unions, if you find all this in the record of
the Democratic party, why should you change?
Do not swap horses while you are crossing a
stream. (Applause.) You have got a good
thing now and you had better keep It. (Ap
plause.)
And while I am on this subject, I want to
say right here that I am in favor of the city
government paying the best wages for labor.
The city government should be an example to
individuals; it should be the very best employer
of them as regards wages and hours of labor.
I am In favor of the strictest enforcement on
the part, of the city of the eight-hour law. If
I am elected I will see that every department
of the city is regulated by the eight-hour law.
That the Police Department is regulated by the
eight-hour law. That the city parks are reg
ulated by the eight-hour law. And, gentlemen,
as a guarantee that I will do this I aak you to
look at our record in the -past few years with
respect to the payment, the regulation and the
enforcement of the rights of labor. Gentlemen,
I thank you. (Applause.)

WEAKNESS OF WELLS AND DANGER
OF ELECTION OF SCHMITZ SEND
MANY VOTERS INTO TOBIN CAMF
Shrewd Politicians Concede the Defeat of Re
publican Candidate, While Union Labor Party
Leader's Utterances Alienate Conservatives
]\ sfANAGERS of the Republican boss ticket secretly acknowl-
IVI edge the defeat of Wells, but they will not concede the elec
tion of Tobin. Wagers were laid yesterday that Schmita
would get 20,000 votes. Estimates of the vote next Tuesday range
from 55,000 to 60,000. Last night, when the news was received at
Republican headquarters that Colonel T: V. Eddy, an old-time ora
tor of the party, was addressing a non-partisan audience at Met
ropolitan Hall and advocating the election of Schmitz for Mayor
and Byington for District Attorney, there was consternation in the
boss camp. The bosses are using the plea that Schmitz is deriving
'most of his strength from voters who formerly affiliated with the
Democratic party. The facts are at variance with th* plea.
Schmitz is drawing largely from the Republican ranks, and the ac
tive leaders in his campaign battled for the Republican cause in the
contest last November. The election of Schmitz can be averted by
open determination on the part of conservative Republican ctfizens
to lend their support to Mr. Tobin.
vyj-^ OLinCIANS whose Judgment 13
POLITICIANS whose Judgment
not warped by prejudice or party
W*** enthusiasm assert that the race
JX for Mayor is between Tobin and
Schmitz. At Republican head
quarters the opinion is expressed that the
contest will be close between Wells and
Schmitz. At Democratic headquarters the
statement is advanced that Tobin is in the
lead and Schmitz is next. All the politi
cians recognize the danger of Schmitz's
election. There Is no certainty that the
danger would be diminished by the with
drawal of Wells from the field, for in that
event partisan Republicans, having no
party candidate to support, would resent
the withdrawal by transferring their sup
port to Schmitz, who is a Republican, a
Native Son and a director of the Repub
lican Primary League.
The only safe course for Republican
business men and property owners to pur
sue is to come out frankly and openly for
Tobin, a young man whose record in the
Board of Supervisors is commendable.
Moreover, he has positive opinions regard
ing the management of municipal affairs,
and he has the courage to define his atti
tude on questions of franchise and public
order, which deeply concern the people
of San Francisco.
The conservative elements of the me
tropolis should unite to prevent the elec
tion of a class candidate, especially as the
candidate, Schmitz, in a recent mass
meeting declared in effect that if he were
elected Mayor the police should not be
used to protect merchants in the transac
tion of lawful business.,. He means that
the whe<3s of commercial industry shall
not move when the strikers and agitators
resolve to tie up the town. Schmitz in
effect announces that he will take orders
from the Caseys and the Furuseths. The
business men of San Francisco do not
want a man for Mayor who will disregard
law and justice to catch the applause of
labor agitators.
Party issues cut no figure in this cam
paign, and even if party issues were in
volved the partisans could find no real
Republican ticket to support. The ticket
put forth by the bogus Republican con
vention was made up from top to bottom
by W. F. Herrin, a noted if not a notori
ous Democrat. He was assisted by Dan
Burns, Johnny Lynch, Jere Burke and
Max Goldberg. No party obligation to
support such a ticket exists.
There are several good reasons why
many workingmen, merchants, property
owners and taxpayers generally cannot be
persuaded to lend their support to Wella.
In the first place, the workingmen, me
chanics and laborers who are not in the
ranks of the Union Labor party will not
tolerate Wells, because he is on record a-,
an opponent of the eight-hour principle.
The liquor dealers and corner grocery
merchants repudiate Wells because he is
on record as an advocate of high license.
Property-owners and residents of the
Mission district will not support Wells
because he has declared against compell
ing the Southern Pacific to remove the
tracks at the Mission. " Improvement
clubs throughout the city are opposed to
Wells. They cannot get from him any
statement of his intentions respecting
public improvements. Independent, antl
boss Republicans cannot be persuaded to
support Wells because he derived his
nomination from the bosses, and because
he now turns to the bosses for ad vie 3
and counsel. â. Â¦. *

SCHMITZ TAKES WORK
GLADLY FROM SHOPS
THAT ARE NON=UNION.
EUGENE E. SCHMITZ is a traitor to the cause he pre
tends to represent. When he tells on the platform of
his loyal interest in the cause of labor unionism he
tells what is untrue. He has forfeited all right to call him
self a union man. He has used his union membership as a
cloak to cover his acts of treason.
The story of some of his treachery was told yesterday.
That story he has tried to explain away. The Call is not
satisfied with the explanation, but will let it go if Mr. Schmitz
will harmonize the following with his public declarations:
Some time last June the Risdon Iron Works received
from the Oceanic Steamship Company an order for a refrig
erating plant for the steamship Alameda The machinists'
strike was on and the engineering company found itself un
ab'e to get out this work in time. They offered part of the
Job to Eugene E. Schmitz, who stars in the industrial world
as the Economic Gas Engine Company and poses on the po
litical platform as the friend of labor and the stanch sup
porter of unions.
Schmitz took the Job. Schmitz, at his shop, during the
strike, did ail the machine work on the compressors of a re
frigerating plant for the steamship Alameda He did it from
plans and patterns supplied by the Risdon Iron Works, The
Risdon Iron Works paid him something in the neighborhood
of $1500 for the work.

spoke as follows:
Ladles and. Gentlemen, Fellow Republicans:
I stand before you this evening as your candi
date for Mayor. I am the representative of the
Republican party for this campaign at the head
of the ticket. Should you elect me, I trust
that you will never regret It. Whatever they
may say, I am an Independent man and I shall
conduct the affairs of the city government In an
honest, upright way, the same as I would
should^ it be in my private business. I am glad
to see so many young men nere this evening.
I can say to you that all that I have ever done
for myself I have done In this vicinity. Every
dollar that I have made I have made honestly.
I employed men in this vicinity for many years
and I have yet to hear of one complaint frotn
those whom I have employed and some of them
worked for me for more than thirty-five years.
I always upheld large wages. I paid the same
wages to my men a year ago when I closed my
business that I did twenty-five years ago, and
when, as you know, profits were very much
larger, and the men worked more hours; but
never has there been any complaint from the
men that worked for me. I always took an in
terest in them. I assisted them in making their
Investments; in procuring their own homes and
their settling around them friends that have
stayed with them for years and years. Their
families have grown up when they worked for
me; their children have been educated and
some of them married, and I saw their fath
ers married also while at work for me. If, as
anybody says, I have ever been unfriendly to
the worklngmen, I can say that that is not so.
You don't hear me going around from place to
place talking to the poor worklngmen. I as
sure you. my friends, that I know of no class so
independent who can travel around the world.
If they shall, comfortably, and enjoy them
selvesânobody, I say, so independent as a
skilled workman. I say this because I see many
here that I think are workmen and I think are
in sympathy with what I say; and I can say
to you farther, my friends, there is none of you
but what is just as likelyâ whose prospects are
Just a3 good of your being wealthy and being
Mayor or' this city, as I was when I was of
your age. Now, my friends, I don't know as
there Is any great question you want to hear
from from me. All of the Issues have been
talked over, and while they have not been
talked over as they have been referred to In
the papers, I can see nothing that requires any
great discussion and that you care for, more
than that the affairs of the city in which your
Interests are are in safe hands; that I am un
der no obligation to any manâ any corporation,
or anybody whose interests are different from
yours. I thank you for this reception.
Favors Mission Railroad Tracks.
The Republican meeting; in the Thirty
fourth District was held in the Mission
Opera-house, Mission street, near Seven
teenth, and It was a doleful affair. Every
one was glad to get home as soon as
Wells had appeared and made his speech.
The hall was far from being filled and a
number of boys sat in the front chairs
and guyed the speakers with cries of
"Mission hot air."
I. J. Truman presided and speeches
were made by John Lackmann, Percy
Beamish, J. S. Nyland. Clifford McLel
land, Charles A. Low, W. H. George, J.
M. Wilkins, Arthur G. Fisk and Senator
Burnett.
When Wells appeared the band played
in order to help out the welcome and the
candidate for Mayor at once started to
talk on the question of the removal of the
Mission railroad tracks. In one breath he
said that he favored the removal of the
tracks and in the next contradicted him
self by telling how convenient it was to
leave a train at Valencia street and in
sisting' that the voters would surely not
ask that the tracks be removed.
The speech in which Wells favored the
retention of the tracks was as follows:
I/aales and Gentlemen: I don't intend to say
very much. They say that I talk too much.
I appear before you as your candidate for
Mayor and as the representative of the Repub
lican party and at the head of this munici
pal ticket. I don't know what I can say to
you that would be new in the matter of poli
tics or to announce my Intended administration
In case I should be elected. For this vicinity
I have recently heard that you had a great
question here. The papers, according to an
interview that they had with the candidate
for Mayor, was in favor of doing a great
wrong In the matter of the railroad tracks.
Prom that interview I do not see how such a
story could be formulated, but it was, all the
fame. I said to that committee which came
to visit me, which I afterward found was
representing a paper, that I would not do
anything for the people in the matter of those
tracki. That was certainly not what I did
say. On the contrary, I tried to impress upon
that committee the fact that whatever the
people wished In that matter, and If I could
be of any assistance to them, I would certainly
put forth my best efforts.
To be criticized about a question of that
kind and in the matter of a few minutes tt
was pretty hard for me at least to decide what
would be the beet, or even what they wanted.
It is no doubt time that those heavy trains
should be taken off the tracks through the
Mission. I have thought so for several years,
but would you yourselves wish to have the
passenger trains, or at least some of them.

SCHMITZ ADDRESSES FOUR LARGE AUDIENCES
AND MAKES PROMISE IF ELECTED TO DO ALL
IN HIS POWER TO PROMOTE CAUSE OF LABOR
t-^Â«^UGENE E. SCHMITZ, the Labor
candidate for Mayor, made the
" rounds last night and was accord
(^ ed warm receptions by his parti
sans at no less than four places.
Members of the old-time parties who wit
nessed the demonstrations in Schmltz's
behalf were convinced that concerted ac
tion by those who favor wise and con
servative local government was impera
tive if it is expected to defeat Schmitz and
his following of candidates.
Schmitz's first appearance during the
evening was before the people of thÂ«
Forty-second District at Pixley's Hall,
corner of Polk and Pacific streets. The
hall was filled to overflowing and great
enthusiasm for the cause of the Labor
ticket was manifested. Schmitz wag
given an ovation on his entrance into the
hall. The demonstration was repeated
when he rose to address the assemblage.
He said in part:
I thank you for this cordial reception. If I
had any doubts as to your friendship this re
ception has effectually removed them. You
have heard that the nominees on the Labor
ticket are unworthy of support because they
represent a classâ the working class. What are
the nominees of the Republican and Democratic
tickets but representatives of a class â the cor
poration and boss class. I have been criticized
by the press in statements which tend to show
that my election would be in the nature of a
public calamity. Thus far no charges attack-
Ing me personally have been made and none can
be made. I think my record as a man will
compare favorably with those of my opponents.
If I am elected I will be the Mayor of the whole
people and not of a class. I will prosecute
such Improvements as your section may de
mand. As for the Geary-street franchise I will
say that I favor its acquisition by the city in
accordance with the ter ns of the charter. I
am opposed to corruption in office, and If you
honor me by electing me your next Mayor I as
sure you I will do all In my power to promote
the cause of labor along the lines of progress,
my motto being special privileges to none, but
fair treatment to all.
Appeal to the Cooks and Waiters.
Schmitz was excused and he hastened

to 316 O'Farrell street, where a meeting
of the Cooks' and Walters' Alliance w.is
being held. He was given the privilege
of addressing the meeting, and his speech
was received with manifestations of ap
proval. He appealed to the sympathy of
his audience by stating that his opponents
were rich men and therefore representa
tives of the capital class, while he was
comparatively a poor man, selected by
the people to represent them. Resuming,
he said:
My opponent, Mr. Tobln, has declared that
good citizenship and honesty were the main
issues of this campaign. While I deny this as
sertion, I will say that my citizenship and
honesty are as unimpeachable as Mr. Tobln' s.
Mr. Tobin is the possessor of great wealth,
not one dollar of which he earned himself. I
have no wealth, but what little I have I made
it myself by honest toil. How can a millionaire
sympathize with the wants of the common peo
ple, with whom he never comes in contact ex
cept about election time when he Is seeking
votes? I have nothing to say against Mr. Tobin
or Mr. Wells. One Is backed by unlimited cap
ital, and the other has behind him corrupt rail
road and political Influences. I have none of
theae recommendations for your suffrage. All
I have is my good name, and the respect your
kind reception assures me I have won. If you
elect me as your Mayor I assure you I will not
betray your trust. I will be the Mayor of the
people as a body and not of any particular
class. 1
Warm Reception at Temple.
The most demonstrative meeting at
tended by Schmitz was at Metropolitan
Temple, where a large audience awaited
his coming. The meeting was held under
the auspices of the non-parti.san conven
tion of the Federation of Municipal Im
provement Clubs. A set programme of
speeches and musical numbers was ren
dered. These included addresses by
Chairman H. V. Morehouse, T. V. Eddy
and several candidates on the labor
ticket, among them being Messrs. Robert
J. Loughery, McEntee. Dillon and
O'Brien. Songs were rendered by ama
teurs, to the delight of the audience, anil
music was furnished by a quartet of Fili
pinos.
When Schmitz appeared on the plat
furm the audience rose to its feet in a
body and cheered wildly. The demon
stration lasted fully three minutes, and
when quiet was restored Mr. Schmitz
said in part:
I sincerely thank you for this kind demon
stration. It goes without aaytng that I hayÂ«
the welfare of the city at heart. It has been
said by my Democratic opponent that my elec
tion would plunge the city In turmoil and
trouble. Your reception convinces me you do
not share that sentiment. I wish to acknowl
edge the indorsement given my candidacy by
the Non-Partisan party. You who are taxpay
ers and property-holders hare given me your In
dorsement, and I am amply satisfied.
They have circulated false stories about mÂ«
in this campaign, but thus far not a single
newspaper has found anything of a personal
nature to urge agaidst me. I think my record
will bear scrutiny. It is not probable that I.
who have made this city my home and reared a
family here, would do anything to plunge the
city in turmoil and trouble. If my election were
to result in that, it were far better I should be
defeated. If I am elected I will endeavor to
administer the duties of my office conscientious
ly honestly and fearlessly. After my term ha 3
expired I believe there will be nothing they can
say against me.
No Policemen on Trucks.
Schmitz next appeared before an au
dience in McGraths hall at 532 Third
street, whfre about 100 people were in at
tendance. He spoke briefly here, his
principal statement being that under his
administration as Mayor no policemen
would ever be employed at dr'ving
trucks. The statement was received
with cheers. Later in the evening
Schmitz addressed a small meeting of the
Sailors' Unton on East street, he a*Â»ur
'.r.g hi 3 hearers that if elected he would
leave no stone unturned to better the lot
of the laboring classes in the city. The
campaignit.g for the evening closed with
a brief talk before the Owls at t.ieir ball
in Washington-square Hall.
There is an unprecedented activity in
the building of churches in Chicago at
the present time, and, in spite of the la
bor difficulties which extended far into
the fall of last year, twenty-one churches
have been built since then or are still
building.

JEFFRIES SAYS HE CANNOT OUTLINE MANNER IN WHICH HE WILL FIGHT
WHEN HE STEPS INTO RING AT MECHANICS' PAVILION TO FACE RUHLIN
Champion's Plan of Action Will Depend on What
His Opponent Will Do--Promises a Merry Mill
if Ruhlin Stands Up and Exchanges Blows
MARBIN SPRINGS, Cal., Oct. 31.
Jeffries was in a reminiscent
mood yesterday. He seldom
voices his views, but when he
does his auditors pay heed to
what he says with a view to getting a
l:ne on the style of fighting he Intends
adopting when he meets Ruhlin. That
he Is going to play a tattoo upon Gus'
stomach is a certainty. He says two or
three "nlcs" in a man's eating apartment
usually make him think of protecting
that portion of his anatomy, thus leav
ing his head open for the coup de. grace.
"Choynskl," he said, "is the only man
in the ring who ever landed a blow
upon me that* I felt. It. was a straight
punch In the nose and made me rock.
Any other man would have given up the
struggle then and there, but I went right
after him. I would have had little trou
ble in defeating Joe that night in WodH
ward's Pavilion, but the Chief of Police
told me before I went into the ring that
if I roughed it he would stop the fight.
During the whole evening he had a cap
tain of police next to him, and I thought
it best not to go in too hard, for fear
they would stop the bout. I was
pretty green then. Choynski after
that fight picked me to be the coming
<-hampion of the world. He went to Chi
cago after the fight and told his friends
to look out for the big Californian. 1
know that Joe bet on me in every sub
sequent fight and won money.
"Fitzsimmons will never fight me
again. I feel sure of that. He practically
told his best friends, Lou Houseman and
George Siler cf Chicago, that he could
never liok me. In my fight with the
blacksmith he tried the left shift three
times on me and only landed once. The
blow was a heavy one and made me cau
tious. The next time he tried this pet
blow I stepped in and placed my head
upon his shoulder and laughed at him.
He tried it again later in the fight, but
1 side-stepped away.
Jeffries Discusses His "Weight.
"When ' 1 fought Fitzsimmons , I
weighed about 207 pounds. That is my
best fighting weight. My friends all think
I am at my best at âd pounds, but that
is not so. The night. I battled with Bob
I was In grand shape. We went at it
hammer .and tongs. I had not started
to fight when I knocked him out. I felt
then as if I could have fought all
Bight."
When Jeffries came in from his long
run last night he weighed about 215
pounds. He believes he can come down
to a lower notch on the balancing rod
and feel strong. Although he -weighs in
the neighborhood of 220 pounds he is as
active as a lightweight.
In speaking of his tight with Sharkey
he says the sailor should have won that
right as he was handicapped by an in
jury to his left arm.
"That night I actually had Sharkey
whipped in the first five rounds, but my
arm failed me. The first three wallops
with the left had Tom staggering. When
my left became crippled I simply used it
for blocking and used the right. I cer
tainly gave hint a terrible beating, and
1 do not think he has recovered from it.
He should have laid off two years, but
I guess if he had done so he would have

been a back number. I was not In the
best " of shape when I fought the sailor.
You can rest assured I will never be
caught out of condition again."
Some friend wrote Jim that Ruhlin was
cultivating a stomach so as to enter the
ring heavy. Jeffries said this was bad
Judgment upon Gus' part. He stated
that no man could fight fast with a stom
ach, nor could he go the route In that
direction.
Jim received a number of visitors yes
terday. The first thing he did was to in
vite them into his â¢'menagerie." He calls
his Bleeping apartment such because of
the firearms, cartridges and other sport-
Ing paraphernalia that litter the room.
Having shown them his guns he laugh
ingly told of hla experiences while out
shooting. Jim is an interesting talker.
He narrated the story of the coon hunt
and the capture of the animal at the ex
pense of his good-natured sparring part
ner, Bob Armstrong.
In the Handball Court.
Jeffries still taboos boxing. He is not
taking any chances with his right arm.
He strained it while playing baseball at
Latalina Island a few munths ago. It is
gradually losing its soreness. He punches
the bag with incredible speed, skips the
rope, rows and piays handball. Yesterday
he gave an exhibition of his prowess at
the game. His speed in the handball
alley was remarkable. Corbett certainly
played a fast game and Jeffries is not far
behind him when he warmed up to his
work. He played handball with The
Call's correspondent and beat him three
straight games. The contest was highly
t-xciting and the spectators enjoyed the
big fellow's fast foot Â¦work.
Jim is strong and rugged. The -month's
stay in this vicinity has done him a world
of good. The tramps he has taken over
the mountains have benefited his win']
and added strength to his underpinning.
He believes this is one of the best places
in the country for a man to gain strength.
Corbett was the first boxer to train at
Harbin. The Hay-es Valley boxer trained
here for his memorable barge fight with
Joe Choynski. "While up here Corbett
made a record climbing the steep moun
tain in front of the hotel that stood for
many years. Jeffries believes in hill
climbing, but, like a wise man, does not
risk his neck breaking records.
"I have been asked time and again how
I am going to fight Ruhlin." Jeffries said.
"The question cannot be answered at this
time. It will depend wholly upon my op
ponent. If he stands up and gives blow
for blow there will be a merry time in
store for him and the spectators will see
some real fighting. If, however, Ruhlin
should run away I will simply stand and
laugh at him. It would be a waste of time
to chase him around the ring. We are
both there to test our supremacy. I will
po to the center and -vrlll not break
ground. I have never done bo and actu
ally don't know how to retreat."
jim was in a happy mood last night.
With brother Jack and a few others he
tied a cow bell under Bob Armstrong's
bed. and when the big colored boxer was
dreaming of chickens Jen* gave the stringr
a couple of jerks. The old bell clanged
loudly In the still night and Bob jumped
Crotn the bed with a yell. He soon dis
covered the cause of the disturbance and
opened his window and admonished tho
jokers to "go awa-a-a-y back and sit
down."
H. Williams Jr. said his club had prom

of ten of his racers.
The Mount Vernon filly brought the best
price, Â£3200. Watershed, the winner of
the Cambridgeshire stakes yesterday, for
which Mr. Whitney paid Â£200 when J. B.

It was decided that the usual practice
of issuing complimentary passes to the
! track should be totally abolished. Thifi
action rnei with the hearty approval of
! the stockholders.
The directors also decided to abolish the
recall flag in starting. This action will
no doubt please horsemen, for they seem
a unit in declaring against the ilag.
Â¦ Mr. Jerry Driscoll, representing Kainey
& Driscoll, came before the board and
said that because of the fact that the
stockholders, with the consent of the
board of directors, had decided to charge
an admission fee to the track of $1 50 for
men and 11 for women, the firm desired
to withdraw its bid for the privilege of
the field books. The withdrawal was ac
cepted, and the field book privilege is
therefore now open to the highest bidder.
Joseph A. Murphy, accompanied by his
family, arrived from St. Louis yesterday
and registered at the Occidental Hotel.
The Mound City racing official will, as
usual, fill the position of presiding judge
at Oakland to-morrow. He reports that
Dan Honig recently purchased a couple
of horses and would undoubtedly make
the California trip.
Starter "Jake" Holtman, looking the
picture of health, stepped off last night's
overland after a very successful season
with the flag on the Chicago tracks. Jake
favors the recall flag, but said "All right,
if the public don't like it give them what
they do like." Mrs. Holtman accompanies
her husband.
E. T. Martin, who booked successfully
at Harlem and the other Western tracks,
is due here to-night. Henry Frolich and

Exciting Bouts at Hayes

The monthly exhibition of the Hayos
Valley Athletic Club was held last night
in Mechanics' Pavilion annex. Con Shee
han, George Green's newly discovered
light heavy-weight, and Ed Smith, Bay
City Athletic Club, were programmed to
furnish one of the main events of the
evening. After a hugging match that
lasted about half a round Smith's Jaw
collided with Sheehan's left hand and he
went to the canvas and was counted out.
J. J. Dukelow, champion welter-weight
of America, and Charles Hawley, Bay
City Athletic Club, were also down on ..he
bill as another main tvent, but Dukelow
robbed the bout of interest by landing a
terrific right swing in the first round
which sent Hawley to the floor In a heap.
He took the count and stumbled to his
feet only to be knocked down again.
Dukelow went right to his opponent,
knocking him down five or six times. In
the second round Dukelow drew Hawley
out with a feint and then sent a trip
hammer right to his short ribs. Hawley
went to the feathers for keeps and was
counted out.
Billy Ingnam and Harry Bowers
weighed in at 160 pounds and furnished
the most exciting bout of the evening.
When the gong brought them to the cen
ter of the ring they went to work with
a vim. Bowers caught Ingham with a
right Jolt on the Jaw and for a moment
It seemed all over but the shouting. Ing
ham managed to last the round by clinch
ing, and at the close landed a swing en
Bowers' Jaw that put him on his
haunches. In the second round Ingham's
head cleared and he did some fast fight
ing. Bowers met his onslaughts with
right and left counters, but Ingham man
aged to land a left hook on his oppo
nent's jaw which ended the bout.
Barney Driscoll and Mart Attel, two

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 31.â
Tickets for the Intercollegiate football
game on November 9 were placed on sale
at the gridiron box office at 1:30 o'clGck
this afternoon by Treasurer Edwards. In
less than three hours over seven hundred
tickets had been ' scrld, realizing about
$1500 in cash. Students lined up before the
office at least an hour apd a half before
the sale began in order to get first choice
of seats. Many of them purchased the

sirable seats for friends unable to come
to the office early in the afternoon. The
remainder of the tickets will be sold at

are pointing to an exceedingly large sale.
Bert Oliver is said to~ be the choice of
the majority of the college coaches and
officials for the exacting position of ref
eree at the intercollegiate football game.
Coach Fickert of Stanford is, it is
claimed, the only one holding out against
his selection. Oliver has proved the best
official seen here this season. He under
stands the game thoroughly and insists
on everybody on the field playing fairly.
He has allowed no side line coaching.
Tickets for the game will be placed on
sale in this city to-morrow at noon at
Clabrough, Golcher & Co.'s and H. Skin
ner's.
The Reliance and Olympic Athletic Clib
teams have let up in their training. They
will resume practice again- at once if a

The Challenger for the Championship Expresses
Confidence in His Ability to Wrest the Title
From the Angelano at Their Coming Meeting
JOE KENNEDY trudged over the
Six-mile House hill to Blanken's
yesterday to see Jim Jeffries' next
opponent. Ruhlin was in the gym
nasium doing his daily afternoon
stunt when he spied Joe coming down the
road and went to the door to meet him.
The two big fellows shook hands warmly
and the ta!k Instantly centered upon Jef
fries and the coming fight.
"If you went at it the other night over
in Oakland as cautiously as you did when
you fought me out here," said Ruhlin, "I
think you would have stayed the limit."
Kennedy laug-hed and replied, "Well,
Gus, I hope you do better than I did. but
when I went into that ring with Jeffries I
had no intention of simply trying to stay
the limit. There was a chance for me
to secure the heavyweight title and I
went right to my quarry to win."
"i have seen Jeffries in a great many
of his fights, Joe," put in Ruhlin. "but the
best showing- I ever saw him make was
with you the other night. He fought
faster and cleverer than ever I saw Mm
before and the battle gave me a line on
several things that are going to help me a
great deal in this fight."
Kennedy, and Ruhlin talked seriously in
this strain for several minutes and then
commenced to joke one another about the
time Joe gained the decision over Gus in a
twenty-round contest at Woodward's Pa
vilion. While Charlie Goft was rubbing
Ruhlin down after his afternoon "gym"
work Kennedy commented upon Ruhlin's
fine appearance. Joe admitted that Ruh
lin looked fully twenty pounds heavier
than he did when he boxed him.
Some Fun With Jeff's Picture.
In Ruhlin's training quarters there is a
large sized lithograph of Jeffries. Ruhlin
takes a look at it now and again and then
turns loose some of his ready wit. While
sparring around the room at an imaginary
foe Gus often stops in front of the pic
ture and feints and fiddles in a way which
gives rise to all sorts of expressions from
the spectators. The picture is directly be
tween puhlin's big made-to-order punch

SENATORS WIN A GAME CLEVERLY
FROM UNCLE'S BASEBALL STARS
The baseball enthusiasts so fortunate as
to be rjresent at Recreation Part yester
day saw one of ti:e greatest games of the
year, incorporated with which were a
number of play 3 not often seen here. The
Same was won in the tenth inning by
Sacramento by a score of 2 to 1.
Â¦\Vhalen pitched for Uncle Henry's men
and was unusually wild, sending eight
men to first on passes. This did not have
any bearing on the outcome of the game,
as none of the men scored.
The Wasps scored their first and only
run in the fourth. Hildebrand bunted to
Pitcher Dojrte, who threw wild to first,
sending "HiMe" to second and then to
third. Pabst hit a hot one to Devertaux,
wi-o recovered the ball in time to retire
thj: batter at first. Hildebrand scored on
thi> play.
Stanley was the first Senator to make a
circuit of the bases. He hit to 'Jimmy' 1
Whalen, who fumbled the ball, letting him.
reach first in safety. He went to second
on a passed ball and scored on Sheehan's
hit over second, on which the batter made
second. With two out and the bases full
Hoffer flew out, retiring the side.
The winning run was scored in the last
half of the tenth. Davis, the first man
up. sent the ball put to the left field fence
for two bags. McLaughlin hit to Whalen,
who threw wild to rhird to head off Davis.
The Senator raced home with the win
ning run.
In the seventh Sheehan hit safely. the
ball rolling between "Josh" Reilly's legs.
He stole second and third and started
home on Courtney's hit. Flood, who was
coaching at third, ran in ahead of him
to rattle the catcher. Flood crossed the
plate and Sheehan was called "out" be
cause of the coacher's interference.
Coachers have often run part way home,
but It is a long time since any one went
to the extreme which Flood did.
In the ninth inning your I'ncle Henry
Harris showed how well up he Is on
technical "baseball. With one man on base
and two out Courtney, the star batter of
the league, was up. A hit meant a run
and the game. Harris told Whalen to
pitch to the first baseman instead of tak
ing a chance with Courtney. This resulted
in giving the Senator a pass to first.
Hoffer forced him out at second, retiring
the side. The score:

Oakland Plays Badly.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 31.-The Oakland
Cripples put up a miserable exhibition to
day. There was scarcely any competition
to the game. Babbitt piled up three er
ing bag and a sack of grain suspended
from the wall by a heavy cord an im
provised deÂ«d bag. as It were, whlcr.
bangs away at to get the range and sen
sation of punching a man 3 body
takes a turn at the regular ball rtrs
Ing at it with terrific power and spe^-i.
and then suddenly switches with a side
step to the sack of grain. In makins thia
switch yesterday Gus let a terrific left
hand rip go toward Jeff's picture and then
pulled it back just in time to save his mite
from Injury on the thick wall. "If it was
only as soft as that," laughed Gus as he
turned his eyes, which were shining with
an amused light, toward the lithograph.
Predicts a New Cnampion.
"You can say for me that there will be
a new champion after we get together,
said Ruhlin as he stepped into his clothes
after his rub. "I feel more confident
of winning than I ever did in any of my
fights. I don't know why this is so, but
I really feel as if I am going to give bin.
the same medicine I gave Sharkey. I
won't even give him a look-in If ever U
starts to come my way."
Ruhlin is one of those fighters who can
take a beating when tlie tide of battle is
ebbing against him, and on the other
Land when it comes his way he generaily
flghts his man as near to the floor a-*
the referee will let him.
Gus is a believer in novelties in train
ing. Unlike the large percentage of fight
ers who train according to strict rules,
he has methods of his own. Instead of
doing his road work all muffled up with
extra sweaters and cumbersome clothes.
Gus takes to the road clad in a woolen
suit and a light sweater. In the gymna
sium he works out in a small breech
cloth. He believes the body should be
lightly clad on all occasiona to allow thÂ»Â»
free flow of perspiration.
Speaking of the plars to take the pic
tures of the fight, Ruhlin said his mana
ger Billy Madder, would do whatever ho
thought best in the matter. "Persona My.
I have no objection to fighting before a
camera." he said. 'If it ia bad for
me it will be equally bad for Jeffries."
Madden was in town all day arranging
matters pertaining to the proposed plan
of taking pictures of the fight.

NOTEâ In the above exposition of the tides
the early morning tides are given in the left
hand column and the successive tides of the
day in the order of occurrence as to time: the
fourth time column gives the last tide of the
day, except when there are but three tides, as
sometimes occurs. The heights given are in ad
dition to the soundings of the United States
Coast Survey Charts, except when a minus < â )
sign precedes the height, and then the number
given is subtracted from the depth given by the
charts. The plane of reference is the mean of
the lower low waters.

THE CHOICE OF SUPERVISORS.
FOR obvious reasons the railroad bosses, Herrin
and Burke, and their allies, Burns, Rainey,
Gunst and Goldberg, are not making any con
spicuous display of their candidates for Supervisors.
Ever since Mr. Wells declared that if he had known
what sort of a gang was to be nominated for that
office he would not have accepted the nomination for
Mayor the bosses have kept their Supervisor candi
dates as much out of sight as possible. The public,
however, should not be deceived by such tactics.
These candidates are still in the field. The bosses
are working fcr them as far as they can without en
dangering the few remaining chances of electing
Well?, and consequently there remains a danger that
they may be elected.
The Burke and Herrin ticket for Supervisors is
pledged not only to the corporations which Herrin
serve*, but also to Burns and to Gunst A victory for
the ticket would mean not only the granting of undue
favors to the corporations, and the looting of the city
in that way upon a large scale, but it would also mean
the surrender of the city into the hands of those who
wish a wide-open town. It would mean a renewal of
track gambling, the reopening of poolrooms and the
revival of the side-door saloon. In short, it would
restore all those evils whose suppression cost the city
to long and so hard a contest in the past.
It is not for nothing that Dan Bums, Sam Rainey,
Mote Gunst and Jere Burke have formed a combi
nation to support the ticket which Herrin and his cor
porations dictated to the so-called Republican con
vention. These men have united to do politics, and
their politics, if successful, will consist in doing San
Francisco. They have nominated for Supervisors a
f men almost all of whom are utterly unknown
to the city at large. They are men who in office will
Lave no other policy than that of doing the bidding
of the bosses. Mr. Wells has sai(J they could do no
harm in office, because the charter will prevent. The
people, however, know better. Once in office that
gang would do every harm that is included in the
phrase, "i wide-open town."
We have had a long fight in this city against Ingle
side track gambling, ogainst downtown poolrooms
and against side-entrance saloons. The people are
well aware of the manifold evils which emanated from
those sources. They can recall the records of the
police and the criminal courts, showing & long and
ever lengthening line of crimes ranging from petty
thefts to murder or suicide., which were due to the
temptations and the degradations of the various kinds
of gambling-rooms. Therefore, when Mr. Wells says
the corporation ticket for Supervisors can do no
harm the people do not believe him. The decent and
intelligent people of San Francisco know full well
that if the city be run as Dan Burns and Mose Gunst
desire, the amount of harm done will be so great that
it will affect all conditions of society and bring loss
anti sorrow and even shame and ruin to many a
home.
The voters of San Francisco can afford to take no
chances with the Supervisor ticket. We have now in
office a Board of Supervisors that Mr Wells himself
lus described as the best he has known in San Fran
cisco in forty years. It has been honest and it has
been efficient. Most of its members have been re
nominated. They ought to be re-elected. They are
pledged to no corporations and they will be the crea
tures of no bosses. What they have done in the past
is the best guarantee of what they will do in the fu
ture. Between them and their opponents on the Her
rin ticket it is a plain issue between good government
and a gamblers' government. Dan Bufas and Mose
Gunst ire not unknown in this city, and the gang they
support is a gang that honest men will distrust.
According to the Boston Globe the "Philosophical
Anarchists" of that city are thinking of changing
?heir name, but it would be better if they would also
chanre their thoughts and their associations.
THE B3C^.3ytI3SrER.'S PURPOSE.
IT is now plainly seen by all men that since Mr. Hearst came here to personally
direct the course of his paper, it is supporting Schmitz for Mayor and giving the
influence of its political department to the ticket and policy which he represents.
Mr. Hearst does not live in California, and keeps in hiding when he visits
here. His paper is responsible for many things inimical to the interests of this city. It
put the first bitterness and spirit of violence into the late strike, for that purpose coining
as a pretext some flagrant lies about Mr. Symmes and, in general, about the merchants,
manufacturers and business men of San Francisco. It drew the boycott as a weapon ot
vengeance and incited disrespect for law and order. It assailed the police from Chief to
roundsmen, supported the prosecution of members of the force who did thejr duty in
maintaining order, and furnished an object lesson of what may be expected if it and the
lawless agitators succeed in securing control of the city and the power to direct its ad
ministration. Its ferocious slanders of every man who has business investments here and
is part of the commercial force of San Francisco, trying to hold the position of this city
as the metropolis of the coast and to increase the lead it has ahead of its competitors, are
fresh in the memory ot men.
That paper balanced with some skill in its action upon the issues of the coming
election until the arrival of Hearst, hen it threw off the mask and is so openly urging the
Schmitz ticket that Schmitz himself has found it necessary to deny that he secured its sup
port by promising that it should have control of his patronage if he is elected. This denial
amounts to nothing, since such a promise would, under the law, vitiate his election if he
succeed in getting a plurality of the votes. His denial is therefore formal and for the pur
pose of saving the legal point and protecting the title to the office which he hopes to
secure at the polls. Everybody knows that the formality of a promise is not required in
such cases. Everybody knows that if Mr. Hearst succeed in electing Mr. Schmitz the
Examiner will dictate and direct the official course of Mr. Schmitz.
What will be done then is no secret. It was declared in the Schmitz meeting on
Tuesday night. Chief Sullivan will be expelled from the headship of the Police Depart
ment, and Captain Wittman and every captain, sergeant and member of the force who
by protecting person and property saved the city in the late strike and excited the ire ot
the Examiner will be put off the force. The murderers of Rice and the other support
ers of Schmitz who are waiting trial for their savage crimes during the strike will
go free. The police must prosecute these men and the police force will be reorganized
against such prosecution. Mr. Hearst is here, then, to set free red-handed murderers, to
reorganize the police on the basis of non-enforcement of the law. He is here to strike
a foul blow at the prosperity and progress of San Francisco and to give the city a back
set that will shrink its business and dwarf it for years to come.
The roar of indignation that went up from the clergy, colleges and homes of the
United States when his invitation to assassinate the President was accepted by Czolgosz
has driven him away from meddling with national affairs. The local situation in New
York compels his paper there to refrain from supporting Tammany and its support of
Low would not be permitted, so it is doing its Sally Ann and Simple Simon editorial
stunt, while a great fight rages around it, and Hearst comes here to treat San Francisco
as a dog to try poison on. He has no dollar invested in the business of this city. His
paper is an investment, it is true, but it is to prey upon the business of others. His hope
to control the police under Mayor Phelan was defeated. His plan was too rank. When
it failed he blacklisted the Mayor, the president of the Police Board and the Chief of
Police. The election of Tobin will not enable him to wreak vengeance upon those who
foiled him and at the same time grasp the power for which he lusts. The election of
Schmitz will open the \v?y to accomplish his purpose and his paper, therefore, is promot
ing Schmitz' fortunes.
A class government for this city would be bad enough, it would be hard enough
to bear for reasons inherent in such government itself. But when such government
carries under its fangs Hearst and the Examiner as the poison with which it strikes at
law and personal liberty, the situation becomes so serious that the city may well be
alarmed. Let even' man recall the expressions of the Examiner during the strike and
seriously ask himself what will occur if those utterances become the policy of a city ad
ministration! Haviag lost his prestige by the popular resentment of his course toward
President McKinley, and being outlawed by the thinking people and good citizens, of
the whole country, he seeks to become the leader of the lawlessness and discontent ot
the country by securing control of the government of this city.
Of course, he will injure his dupes and will undo such laboring men as take his ad
vice. Hundreds of families are still suffering here because he counseled their heads un
wisely. The mothers, wives and children of the murdered are in sorrow and will be in
want as a result of his appeals to the spirit of murder and disorder. The wounded, with
bruised bodies andÂ« broken bones, are still lying helpless in hospitals or in their homes, and
there are others advised by him who go about with crime upon their souls. They v ere
upright men before he tempted them, and now they do not look their fellow-men in the
eye. He caused them to stain their hands with blood.
Do men with property and families realize that if he accomplish the purpose for
which he came here to lurk in hiding, the area of violence will be enlarged? During the
late strike his dupes, inspired by him with recklessness and violence, entered the homes
of laboring men who desired to support their families by work, and in the presence of
their wives threatened them with death if they attempted to work. At this moment men
dare not go before che Grand Jury to testify against the criminals he encouraged for
fear that Rice's fate may be theirs. The law is helpless and Justice is hamstrung by the
still existing reign of terror which he inspired. Let him get control of the government
of the city and ruffians will visit business men and employers in their homes, to threaten
death as the penalty of resisting any demand that his associates, the agitators, may
make. We see the law failing now because witnesses are threatened with murder. How
will it be when the barbaric, sentiments uttered in Tuesday's meeting for the Hearst-
Schmitz ticket are emblazoned in the City Hall as the principles of the municipal gov
ernment?
It is time for business men to assume the offensive against Hearst and his poison
paper and nefarious influence. It is time to repudiate a man who dare not walk openly
the streets of the city where he was born. It is time to end any form of vassalage to a
non-resident conspirator against the peace and prosperity of San Francisco, who lurks
hidden in the hills like a bandit watching a chance to sack the town.
LET US TALK, JMLTI. WELLS,
SINCE Mr, Weils was asked to answer some
questions of vital importance to the people, he
has continued to make speeches. -On Wednes
day evening he spoke twice.
You are aware, Mr. Wells, that you were requested
to tell why you stayed on the ticket when you said
you would get off. You will remember that the peo
ple asked you to tell who made you stay on, who
made you support a Supervisor ticket that you said
was unfit for support. The people asked you how
you stood on the municipal issues of interest to them,
They expected your answer on Wednesday night.
You spoke twice, and in your first speech you an
swered these important questions by saying; ''I feel
that I am either at home or very near home, for I own
a large house right up the avenue here. I don't live in
it just now, but I did live in it for some time."
Now, really, Mr. Wells, does that large house an
swer the questions that are put to you? The people
ask a question and you answer with a house "up the
avenue.' Nobody said that you did not own a house
up the avenue. No one denied that it is a large house,
and if you will tell how many rooms are in it the num
ber will be admitted. You need not offer the house as
a witness, for the people will admit all it can testify to.
We grant that it is a house; that it is a large house
up the avenue; that it is a large house up the ave
nue, where you used to live, but where you don't
live now. If you will mention the color of the house
we will admit it in order to get on with the case.
After you had sworn your large house as a witness
you had another chance. You went to another meet
ing the same night. The questions of the people fol
lowed yott. Who made you stand up when you
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1901.
wanted to lie down? Who made you swallow the
Supervisor ticket? How do you stand on the fran
chises? In that second meeting, Mr. Wells, with these
questions ringing in your ears, you rose and answered
them by saying, "This is quite a distance from the
northern part of the town, I find."
Now, really, Mr. Wells, was that an answer? Is It
not a fact that all places distant from each other are
not as near as other places not 60 distant? We ad
mit that it is quite a distance from the northern to the
southern part of the town, and your admirers are glad
that you were able to notice it, but why do you play
the two ends of the town against the middle as an an
swer to the questions of the people? What has that
distance to do with your ultimatum, with refusing
Flint a place on the ticket, and your swallowing the
Supervisor ticket? Mr. Wells, yoti may be arte
sian, but your answers to these questions are not
deep. They don't seem to apply; they are not sat
isfactory to the people. You answer in architecture,
real estate and furlongs, when the people want to
know something that cannot be told in the terms of
either. Linear measure, fifty-vara Jots and large
houses are inoffensive in themselves, but they are not
issues in this campaign.
You have until Monday night to answer what the
people ask. Please, Mr. Wells, cease retrospection
and reminiscence, revery and irrelevance, and answer
those questions.
It is worth noting that the spread eagle orators of
the country are no longer speaking of the republic
as extending from Florida to Cape Nome, but from
"Maine to Manila."
MISS WU MAKES INITIAL BOW
IN SAN FRANCISCO SOCIETY
PRETTY little Miss Wu Chingr L-lng,
the adopted daughter of Mme. "Wu,
Â¦wife of Minister Wu, has made her
initial bow into San Francisco so
ciety. No fair society bud, fresh
from a Nob Hill seminary, could have de
ported herself with more becoming grace
under the circumstances.
Ho Vow, the Chinese Consul, "with
charity to all and malice toward none,"
had decreed that those who were anxious
to see Miss Wu could have a personal In
terview with the young lady at the con
sulate on Stockton street at 11 o'clock
yesterday morning. At the appointed
hour several ladles were present. A num
ber of artists and six latest Improved
cameras were formidably arranged in a
row suggestive of the new guns that were
recently placed in position at the entrance
to the Golden Gate.
With a pattering of little feet and sup
pressed laughter as a befitting overture
Miss Wu was led into the room by her
adopted mother. The child was deathly
pale and appeared to realize tha enormity
of the situation. She was directed to a
chair by Mme. Wu and allowed to re
gain her composure. In the meantime the
women folks were taking in the child's
costume from head to toe. Miss Wu'*
hair was arranged with much skill. It was
uaintly plastered down and in the front
there was a Jaunty part. The end of her
hair was plaited and gathered in a knob
just over the right ear. She wore a gor
geous blouse of pink, yellow, black and
v/hite.
After the young lady's wardrobe had
been thoroughly absorbed she was cross
examined by the interested visitors. Mme.
Wu kindly acted as interpreter, but after
a time the wife of the able Chinese diplo
mat decided that she would answer the
questions herself.
"Please ask her if she can dance?" said
a visitor, addressing Mme. Wu. As Miss
Wu has a foot only about three inches
long Mme. Wu took it upon herself to
answer the question and said "No."
"Do ask Miss Wu what her favorite
dress is," was the next Interrogation.
Mme*. Wu stated that her daughter was
then and there wearing her favorite cos
tume. In this manner the questions were
plied and answered by Mme. Wu.
The young lady sat silent with her eyes
cast down and apparently felt that the
sooner the reception was over the bet
ter.
Ho Vow, who acted as master of cere
monies, hurried the camera fiends. Snap
shots were taken of Miss Wu, and with a
look of relief she toppled off upstairs lean
ing on the arm of her servant. â¢
Miss Wu's debut thus became history.

LAGUNITAS RANCH
SCENE OF REVEL
Witnesses Describe the
Late W. B. Fme's
Visit.
SAXIXAS, Oct. 31.â Revelations as to j
how the sale of the Lagunttas ranch was j
made to thÂ« late W. B. Frue were con- ;
tinued in the Superior Court to-day in j
connection with the trial 8f the cross- i
complaint in the suit brought by the Com- '
r.ercial Bank of San Jose to recover from
the estate on a note and mortgage. Val
entine Koch, ex-Councilman and ex-
KayOT of San Joee and ex-director of
the Agnews Insane Asylum, swore that :
Mitchell Phillips, knowing he was lnti
xrate with the late W. B. Frue, sought j
an introduction for himself and Moore. :
They called upon him and requested a i
private Interview, during which Phillips j
asked Koch to intercede and try to sell
the ranch to Frue. He eaid it was worth
$43,000, but that he would take $25,000 and ;
would pay Moore and Koch $1000 each to
aid in making the Bale. Witness Koch
f-p.ld h<? indignantly informed Phillips that '
hij would not have anything to do with
such a bargain. Pc was Invited to the
fishing and hunting trip at which the
effort to sell the ranch to Frue was to
hive been made, but refused.
Hackman Henry Barry described th^
swift evening ride under direction of Phil
lips, when he took Frue to g<Â«t money
from the Union Savings Bank in San Jose
on April 13, 1897.
When Edward Bole*, manager for Phil
ltpe on Lagunitas ranch, took the stand
Ff-nsatlon followed sensation. He said the
ranch buildings were old and dilapidated.
He had received notice from Phillips that
a party of four men was coming down to
thtj ranch, ostensibly for a hunting an'l
fining trip. He was to have everything
ready, as Phillip* believed the trip would
end In a sale. The house, barn an'i
grounds were cleansed, and wine, whisky
and beer were procured. During the
party's stay at the ranch Frue was in
toxicated continually. The sideboard' was
never empty. Phillips' instructions being
p it filled.
The witness at Phillips' request one
month after Frue bought the place had
made en inventory of the property. He
was told by Phillips to make the value of
articles as "high as he possibly could. He
appraised the personal property at double
its actual value. One surrey, valued at
$69, was appraised at $300.

YOUTH IN TEENS
THE ROAD AGENT
Puyallup Valley High
wayman in the
Toils.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Oct. 31.â Perry Reynolds, an
18-year-old youth, is believed to be the
boy bandit who has beer, terrifying the
Puyallup Valley for several weeks past.
During that time farmers and their fam
ilies have been frequently held up as they
were driving along lonely country roads.
Last Friday three Tacoma women were
driving in from Sumner, when a high
wayman stepped into the road and leveled
a revolver at their carriage. He was sur
prised to find that it was occupied by
ladies and permitted them to pass. On
Thursday John Ucheff was held up on the
Edgewood road, but luckily had no money.
On the same day a boy was halted by a
masked robber in that vicinity. The
masked highwayman held up M. F. Sager
and family on Saturday morning as they
were driving to Tacoma. All the money
and valuables they carried were taken.
Later in the day two men were halted and
relieved of their cash.
No less than a half dozen other rob
beries have occurred between Bismarck
and Puyallup. In every instance the
highwayman was masked with a dirty
white handkerchiefâ just sucli a handker
chief as was found on Perry Reynolds
when he was arrested on Monday even
ing by Detective Moran as he was com
ing toward the city. A 3&-caliber nickel
plated revolver was taken from the young*
man's pocket. A similar weapon was
used by the masked man. M. F. Sager
positively identified as his money bag a
pouch taken from Reynolds.
The lad was arraigned this afternoon on
a charge of highway robbery and held for
trial. Numerous witnesses were on hand,
ready to swear that the young man is the
one who last week halted them and at
the mint of a revolver forced them to
hand over their ready cash and other val
uables. Reynolds maintains his inno
cence, but "offers no explanation of his
sion of numerous articles taken
from persons who were robbed.

MEXICAN TROOPS
ROUT THE YAQUIS
Battle Is Fought in a
Narrow Canyon Near
Guaymas.
Indians Retreat t) Moun
tains, Leaving Many Dead
and Wounded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz., Oct. 31.â After weeks of
raiding of ranches and haciendas and
murdering ranchers, the Yaqul Indians
have met their first formidable opposition.
A courier arrived in Guaymas yesterday,
bearing the news that a band of Taqui3
was coming toward that city, well armed
and mounted. Ueutenajit Colonel Quin
tro at once ordered his 300 troops Into the
field, and the little army started out to
attack the Indians, They came upon them
in La Tuna Tanyon and there a battle
took place.
The Yaquis were taken by surprise, as
they believed there were no troops in So
nora. The soldiers, with Lieutenant Col
onel Quintro at their head, charged into
the narrow canyon. The battle was faat
and furious and lasted almost a half hour;
A large number of Yaquia were killed or
wounded. Heveral troopers were wuund
ed, but not a Mexican was killed.
The Yaquis scattered in an attempt to
escape, but the troops followed them out
of the canyon. The Indians fled to the
mountains, pursued by the cavalry. There
were several hundred Yaquis in the band.
They went toward Yaqul Valley, which is
their stroijghold.
The YaquiÃ had been robbing ranches
for some time in the valley close to Guay
mas and a half dozen Mexicans had be*>n
killed by them. Hundreds of horses have
been stolen, corn packed away and other
provisions taken from the haciendas. At
San Lorenzo yesterday the band which
was afterward attacked by the cavalry
destroyed a house and drove off the
horses. They also visited La Misa rancho.
which had been deserted several days ago
on account of the Yaqui raids in that
vicinity. It is believed the Yaquis will b<2
overtaken by the cavalry and that an
other fight will occur. Lieutenant Colo
el Quintro Is highly commended by the
Guaymas newspapers and the people gen
erally for his bravery in attacking the
Indians and driving them back to tha
mountains. The Indians have plenty of
horses and provisions and are in a posi
tion to continue the war. Lieutenant Col
onel Quintro will no doubt be reinforced.
The Mexican people of Guaymaa have
been fearful lest the Yaquis enter that
city to plunder and murder. Their out
rages during the past week were com
mitted within fifty miles of Guaymas.
The Yaqui war was Bu#t>osed to be at
an end and Federal troops were with
drawn from the field after a year of fight
ing in Yaqul Valley. When Tetebite, the
Yaqul chief, was killed a few months ago
it was declared by the Mexicans that the
struggle was at an end forever. But a
new- chief has evidently taken charge of
the Indians and is pressing them to re
new the warfare with the Mexican Gov
ernment. Yaqui Valley is very rich and
the Indians refuse to leave and go to the
southern portion of the republic, which
is the desire of the Mexican Government.
There are several thousand Yaquis and
the Mexicans find it hard to battle against
them in their strongholds of the valley.
Hundreds of peaceful Yaquis are- said
to have Joined the warriors during the
past week. Those who are familiar with
conditions in Sonora believe that, now
that the Yaquis have renewed the war
fare in earnest, only their extermination
will bring permanent peace in that region.

TACOMA, Oct. 31.â Late arrivals say
that the last steamers from. Nome left net
less than 1000 stranded persons there, who
will be dependent on charity for mainte
nance during the winter. G. L. Rlckard,
a member of the Nome City Council, who
has arrived here to spend the winter, says
there was much disappointment over the
failure of the Government to send a trans
port to bring down the penniless pros
pectors. Food supplies at Nome are plen
tiful but they are In hands of. the well

MODOC LYNCHING
CASES IN COURT
Motion to Set Aside
the Indictment Is

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALTURAS, Oct. 31.â The case of the
people versus J. W. Brown et al., the al
leged Lookout lynchers, was called
in the Superior Court this morn
ing before Judge J. W, Harrington.
J. B. Baker, for the defense, moved to
set aside the indictment found by the
Grand Jury upon the ground that the
names of the witnesses who testified be
fore the Grand Jury were not mentioned
in and Inscribed upon the indictment, and
that persons were allowed to be present
tit the session at the Grand Jury Mho had
no official connection with the case; also
that certain depositions were not intro
duced. Judge Harrington denied the mo
tion and granted the defense until to
morrow to file a demurrer. A motion to
set aside the ii.dictment of Eades will be
heard to-morrow.
REDDING, Oct. 31.â A .strange story
was told in Redding to-day bjt a man of
unquestioned Integrity, and conversant
with the facts, which indicates that that
portion of the people of Modoc County
who take any active interest whatever
In the late Lookout lynchings have
leagued together to prevent the convic
tion of any of the men accused of partici
pation In the crime and to stop all pro
ceedings as speedily and effectually as
possible. The man who says this is a
well-to-do farmer of Modoc County, who
Is a member of the Grand Jury that in
dicted lsom Eades, James W. Brown
and Robert E. Leventon. He Is extremely
anxious to see Justice done, but it is wise,
he says, not to talk too much in that
county. The men who are talking most
there are not men with any Interest or
relationships that might suffer.
This grand juror says that the men
who lynched Calvin Hall, his three sona
and Daniel Yantes were fourteen in num
ber, and that :heir identity is known to
nearly every resident of the Lookout dis
trict. He says that the mob was gathered
hastily, that the men who composed itâ
nearly all of them .young menâ reside In
Lookout and in the immediate vicinity,
and that that community has set Itself
solidly to thwart all efforts to ferret out
the guilty men and to retard any prose
cution. The rest of Modoc County is de
scribed as being too fearful or too apa
thetic to do anything to aid the cause of
justice.
"The three men In jail and about eleven
others." Bald the informant, "are the men
who did the lynching. Their neighbors
know who are guilty, and any clever per
son can find out who they are. But I
believe not one of them can be convicted.
Somebody must turn traitor if a convic
tion Is had on anything but circumstan
tial evidence, nnd this no one is apt tc
do. Some want to, but are afraid. Nearly
every one of the guilty men testified be
fore the Grand Jury. It will be a bitter,
bitter day for the first man that turns
State's evidence. If none of the lyncheru
are members of the Grand Jury, at least

ENDS HER LIFE
WITH A RAZOR
Mrs. John T. Chestnut
of Pacific Grove a
Suicide.
â i Â»
Fear That She Is Becoming
Insane Leads to the
Sad Tragedy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Oct. 31.â Mrs. J. T.
Chestnut, widow of thte late John T.
Chestnut, and one of the prominent resi
dents of Monterey County, committed sui
cide at her home in this city this after
noon while suffering from acute melan
cholia. She left a letter which bids fare
well to her family and gives as a reason
for her suicide that she knew she was
becoming, insane and wished to die while
in her right mind. The letter would in
dicate that the writer was suffering from
mental aberration.
Shortly before 5 o'clock Mrs. Chestnut
was found by her son-in-law, I. K. Mil
ler, lying upon the floor of her room, with
her throat cut. A bloody razor, the in
strument with which she had ended her
life, lay beside her. Nothing is known
of the circumstances of her death as she
was alone In the house all afternoon.
Mrs. Chestnut has been more or less
affected by melancholia since the death
of her husband about a year ago. Lately
she had grown so much worse that her
family became alarmed, although a trag
edy such as that of to-day was not ex
pected. Mrs. Chestnut's daughter was
preparing to taktÂ» her away for a change
of scene, In the hope of bettering her
mental condition, and It is believed the
slight bustle incident to preparation for
the trip was too much for her weak,
nervous condition.
Mrs. Chestnut leaves three daughters,
Mrs I. K. Miller and Miss Bessie Chest
nut of Pacific Grove and Mrs. Elmer P.
Alexander of Salinas.
Southworth-Nicholas Wedding.
SAN RAFAEL., Oct. 31.â A quiet wed
ding? took place In the home of Mrs. T. W.
Park in this city to-day when her sister,
Miss Belle Carter Nicholas, was united in
marnage to Frederick Bates Southworth.
The ceremony was performed by the Rev.
J. 8. McDonald. The house was beauti
fully decorated. Only a few intimate
friends witnessed the ceremony. After a
wedding 1 breakfast Mr. and Mrs. South
worth departed for Del Monte, where they
will spend their honeymoon, afterward
making this their home. The bride has a
large circle of friends. She is a charm-
Ing young woman and possessed of rare
gifts of mind.
they have a strong influence In that
body."
The Mo<3oc farmer says that four mem
bers of the jury opposed the indictment of
Eades, Leventon and his young- brother
in-law Brown in unmeasured terms. Tho
indictments were found only after these
men had exhausted their last resource
to prevent suc-h action. It is said around
lookout that certain men who own ex
tensive stock interests are prepared to
spend everything they have in an en
deavor to prevent the conviction of any
of the three men in jail.

WEAVING A WEB
ABOUT BUCKLEY
Witnesses Testify as to
Murder of George
W. Rice.
From Back View One of
Them Identifies Buckley
as the Shooter.
The preliminary examination of William
Buckley, Thomas Moran. Charles Donnel
ly axiu Edward Duncan on the charge of
murder for killing George W. Rice, a non
union machinist, at Twentieth and Howard
streets on October lh was continued be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday. The prose
cufon Is weaving a web around Buckley
which has not yet befen completed.
Louis R. Levy, 2736^ Howard street, was
the first witness examined. He testified
that he was on the car on the right side
of the front dummy and when it stopped
at Twentieth street he heard a shot on
the left side. He jumped off the car and
started to run round to the left side, when
three more shots were fired. He saw two
men running down Twentieth street and
ran after them for a short distance till
they turned into Shotvrell street.
Buckley was made to stand with his
back toward the witness and while he
was in that position Levy identified him
as one of the men who had run away.
Oeorge E. English, 2417 Howard street,
testified that he was on the car. At
Twentieth street Rice got off, as did three
or four others. One of them grabbed hold
of the back of Rice's coat and hit him
five or six times on the head with a club.
After Rice had fallen some one ran
toward him and stood over him, firing
four'shots at him. He was on the left
side of the car. The shooter and the man
who had done the clubbing ran down
Twentieth street and the witness ran
after them till he saw them turn into
Shotwell street. He could not identify
Buckley as the shooter, but said he was
about the same build and very much the
same as regarded his face. Levy took no
notice of the man who did the clubbing.
The witness was very much excited at the
time.
Policeman Brown testified to chasing
and capturing Buckley, who at first said
he was running to catch a Harrison-street
car as he had to meet a lady, and later
paid he had gone to Twentieth and How
ard streets to see a "scab licked." The
witness took Buckley to the hospital and
R;cc said he looked like the man who shot,
him and described him as wearing a white
Â¦Ml and gray coat.
Corporal Russell showed a diagram of
tht scene of the murder and the case was
cortinued till this morning.
BAILBOAD MAN MAKES
BIG HIT AS SALESMAN
John S. Inglis Sells Shirtwaists and
Hats Damaged by Fire tc His
Friends.
Yesterday was bargain day in the Union
Pacific Company freight offices at 5 Mont
gomery street. "Jack" Inglis officiated
as salesman and floor walker and was
kept busy all day selling men's hats and
ladies' shirtwaists.
The Union Pacific had a train wreck re
cently and had a lar.se shipment of goods
damaged by fire. This included hand
some silk waists consigned to a local dry
goods house, and the latest designs in fall
hat were to go to a popular hatter
on Market street. After deliberation It
was decided to let the railroad people and
their friends take advantage of the bar
gain sale. The young lady stenographers
telephoned their lady friends that there
was a chance to get a swell shirtwaist
cheap. The offices were soon besieged
by a line of the fair sex picking out the
latest things from New York. In the
same way the railroad men soon heard
about the hats, and by night the entire
shipment of goods was sold.
Furey Would Not Prosecute.
The case of J. A. Knapp, charged with
assault to murder, was dismissed by
Judge Cabaniss yesterday. Ed Furey, the
complaining witness, who was formerly a
special officer, said he would not prose
cute Knapp, as he was one of his best
friends. They had a fight in Green's sa
loon, Eddy and Mason streets, and Knapp
fired a shot at Furey.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
SEASONABLE HINTS. .
Guard Your Health, in Fall and Early
Winter.
A change from warm to cold is always
attended with more danger than from a
cold to a warm temperature, hence the
greater mortality from lung and throat
diseases at this season of the year as
compared with spring.
The best protection against colds Is not
bo much in extra clothing as in good di-
gestion.
If the digestion and circulation are good,
colds will be unknown.
Poor digestion causes poor circulation
of the blood, and when in this condition
severe colds are contracted on the slight-
est provocation.
People who make a regular practice of
taking Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after
meals are free from colds simply because
their digestion is perfect, the heart strong
and regular, and the whole system forti-
fied against disease. â¢
It requires little argument to convince
any one that the best safeguard against
colds, pneumonia and changes of temper-
ature is a good stomach.
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meals are dissolved, and mingling with
the food cause it to be promptly digested
and assimilated; they do this because they
contain nothing but harmless digestive
elements, which digest meat, eggs and
other food even when the stomach itself
is weak and flaccid.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets make people
â¢well and keep them well, and the best
habit you can acquire is to keep daily use
of them at meals to make the digestive
organs strong and vigorous.

ROBBERS FIRE
UPON CITIZENS
Kansas Bandits Burn a
Stable and Wreck
a Depot.
LARNED, Kans. . Oct. 31.â Snell's livery
barn was burned early this morning, to
gether with twenty-five horses and a large
lot of buggies and harness. At the same
time the Santa Fe safe was blown to
pieces Â¦with dynamite and the depot badly
wrecked.
It is believed the safe-blowers set the
livery stable on fire in order to attract the
crowd to another part of town. Over a
dozen shots were exchanged between the
robbers and citizens who rushed to the
depot. In the darkness and confusion the
robbers escaped. They secured no booty.
MATLOCK, lowa, Oct. 31.â Early to-day
the Bank of Matlock was robbed by six
men, who secured about $2000. Of this
amount $300 was in silver. Four of the
men stationed themselves so as to guard
all points while the other two went inside.
They made use of dynamite, three heavy
shots being fired, waking many people.
The safe and vault were shattered and
the building was badly wrecked. There
is no ciew and no effort was made to fol
low the robbers because all were so heav
ily armed. The total loss in money and
damage to the safe and building is over
$4000.
DES MOINES, lowa, Oct. 31.â Robbers
during a heavy rainstorm last night blew
open the safe of the Bank of Orispe, in
the town of Orispe, in Union County. They
obtained $300 in cash and a large amount
in negotiable paper. There is no clew to
the robbers.

Dozen Americans Defeat
a Large Insurgent
Force.
MANILA, Oct. 31.â Advices just received
here from Catb'alagon, island of Samar,
say that twelve men of Company G,
Ninth Infantry, under command of Ser
geant Wilford, who had been sent from
Bassy to San Antonio to investigate and
report in regard to the number of bolo
men in the vicinity, were viciously at
tacked by 140 insurgents, who killed two
of the soldiers andwounded two others.
Wilford remainw cool and collected
during the attack, and the survivors say
he acted splendidly. Fourteen of the In
surgents were killed. Captain Bookmiller
of Company G recommends Wilford for
a medal of honor and Privates Swanton
and Vero for certificates of merit.
General Hughes reports the complete
surrender of the insurgents of the island
of Cebu, consisting of 400 men and sixty
offlcrs, with 150 rifles and eight brass field
pieces.
The pouring of troops into the island of
Samar is believed to have had a good
effect on the Cebu insurgents, who had
been wavering for some time. The mal
contents kept up the conflict by saying
that a majority of the American troops
had left the Philippines.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31.â An important
cablegram was received at the War De
partment this morning from General
Chaff ee. It follows in part:
"MANILA, Oct. 31.â Adjutant General,
Washington: The following from Briga
dier General Hughes: "The insurrection
forces on Cebu Island have taken the
oath of allegiance in good faith. Sixty
officers and 400 men have surrendered
arms.'
"This settles for the present, at least,
the disturbance heretofore existing in
Cebu. Future disorder in that island will
be made by deliberate action of inhabi
tants, as peace may be easily preserved
if the people are disposed to do so. I shall
advise Hughes to waste no time, but move
on Bohol immediately. CHAFFEE."

Serious Demonstration by Soldiers

CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 31.â A muti
nous demonstration was made in front of
the Admiralty Offices Tuesday by 600 Â©ul
cers- and non-commissioned Bashi-Ba
zouks, which caused dismay among the
occupants of the Yildiz Palace. The pay
of those who took part in the demonstra
tion is several months in arrears and
only a promise of prompt settlement pre
vented the carrying out of threats of fur

All troops, with the exception of the
w.arines, are paid with fair regularity be
cause they furnish the guard at the week

Howards Reach, a Compromise.
REDWOOD â¬ITY, Oct 31.â Judge Buck
to-day appointed Anna D. Howard and
Edward W. Hcrward aa special adminis
trators of the estate of William H. How
ard. The appointment was made with the
consent of all persons interested in the
estate and thus one threatened contest
was avoided. To-day's compromise, how
ever, does not decide which willâ that pro
duced by the son or the one presented by
the widow of the deceasedâ shall be ad
mitted to probate, and there may yet be
a contest over the property.
OVERHEAD WIRES
MAY COME DOWN
Supervisors Favor Dras
tic Measure Toward
Corporation.
Would Force Market Street
Company to Keep Its
Obligations.
In order to force the Market-street Rail
way Company to keep Its promise to take
up Its abandoned tracks and restore the
streets td their original condition, the Su
pervisors-- Public Utilities Committee de
cided yesterday to recommend an ordi
nance requiring the street car corpora
tions to. take down all overhead electric
wires in certain districts. When the com
mittee met there was no representative
present from the Market-street Company,
although Jere Burke had promised at the
last meeting to have Superintendent of
Construction Lynch appear to answer cer
tain questions.
The committee waa pot pleased at the
absence of Burke and {Lynch, and after a
spirited discussion agreed that something
should be done to compel the big corpor
ation to fulfill its obligations. It was the
sense of Supervisors Reed, McCarthy and
Connor, composing the committee, that a
district should be created wherein no
overhead wires shall be permitted to be
maintained. This district, as suggested
by the committee, is to be bounded by
Van Ness avenue. Eleventh street, Chan
nel street and the bay.
It was also resolved to ask the Attor
ney General for permission to sue the
Market-street Company for forfeiture of
its franchise on account of its refusal to
keep the law in regard to paving the
streets between its tracks after tearing
up its abandoned rails and slots. The
ordinance will be drafted so as to forbid
overhead wires on Howard, Ellis and
Post streets where the company has neg
lected to live up to the terms of its fran
chise.
Jere Burke came in after action on the
proposed ordinance had been taken.
Burke asked that the hearing on the mat
ter be postponed for one week, as Super
intendent Lynch was unable to be pres
ent. The request was granted, but the
ordinance agreed upon will come before
the Supervisors nex. Monday.
A resolution was also adopted calling
on the Spring Val' y Water Works, the
VlÃitacion Water Company and all others
having existing water works capable of
being used to supply water to the inhabi
tants of this city to offer their plants for
sale to this city on or before November
18, 1901. This ie in accordance with the
charter, and the lowest offer will be pit
ted against the proposition to bring water
from the Tuolumne River when they are
submitted to a vote of the people.
NOE VALLEY WILL SOON
HAVE NEW SCHOOLHOUSE
Auditor Wells Signs Demand for
Payment for Site at Twenty-
Fourth and Noe Streets.
Acting on the advice of his attorney,
Reuben H. Lloyd, Auditor Wells yester
day audited the demand for $10,465 for the
property recently purchased at the cor
ner of Twenty-fourth and Noe streets by
the Board of Education. When the de
mand was presented to the Auditor one
month ago he refused to sign it, because
he denied the power of the board to ac
quire property in Its own name. The
Question was referred to his attorney,
who pronounces the transaction perfectly
legal.
The Board of Education will shortly
have plans prepared for an eight-room
schoolhouse in this district, which sauly
needs it. The Board of Public Works will
be asked to make an estimate of the cost
of the butldingr as soon as the deed is
signed by the former owners of the site â
Mary E. Gies, Christina Gies, James M.
Curtin and Mary Tobener.

Chinese Wife Applies to Charitable
Society for Assistance in Im
proving Hi 3 Conduct.
Sam Gin Wah. a Chinaman who has for
many years been conducting a lucrative
laundry business on Jessie street, near
Sixth, has proved himself unable 1 :o bear
prosperity and is now in danger of prose
cution by Secretary White of thÂ© Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
for abusing hia wife and family.
Mrs. Gin Wah states that her husband
will not furnish sufficient money for food
and clothing, but is constantly away from
home on a drinking spree, which has al
ready lasted several years and whicti
seems likely to continue unless forcible
measures are taken to put a stop to it.
Sam's five little children have to atay In
the house because hey have no clothes
which are suitable for street wear, and
their education is consequently sadly neg
lected.
Their mother says that sha does not
care if Sam drinks himself to death, for
very likely the god 3 have ordained that
such shall be his end, but she asks that
he be compelled to support the family.
She thinks that her husband will listen
favorably and respectfully to the advice
of a Police Judge.

EASTERN MARKETS.
t
New York Stock Market. Â¦]-
NEW YORK, Oct. Except for special
averages lnÂ«a few individual stocks, to-day's
market ran down near stagnation many times.
There was no pressure to sell, but prices
gravitated to a lower level owing to the par
alysis of demand. The central cause of this
stite or affairs was the advance in the dis
count rite of the Bank of England to 4 per
cent, compared with the 3 per cent rate which
has maintained since June 13 last. This gives
unmistakable notice that further demands are
pending upon the bank's stock of gold, which
the rise in the discount rate is Intended to
protect by diverting the damage upon New
York. No doubt seems to be entertained that
this object will be achieved. In fact, arrange
ments were perfected to-day for shipments of
gold to Paris next week. The weekly state
ments of the Bank of England and the Bank
of France shows the need for the former to
chock the I- rench demand upon their reserves
and as clearly the necessity of the latter for
recuperation. The French bank has gained in
told duriner the week what the English bank
has lost. In Paris the requirement is supple
mented by a pending Stock Exchange settle
ment, so that the bills discounted have been
increased nearly {45,000,000 and the note circu
lation has been expanded over {45.000.000 dur
ing the week. These conditions serve to ex
plain the large recall of Paris credits which
has beer, going on for sjme time past, although
it has been suggested also that foreign lenders
of money are thus expressing dissatisfaction
with some of the syndicate purposes to which
the borrowed lunds have been put. The gold
export* figured in the Sub-Treasury statement
to-day, bringing ui> the day's , gain by
that institution from the open market
to S3.lCS.ofco and the gain since Friday
last to J3.053.C00. Chicago exchange on New
York also weakened to-day and $140,000 was
deposited at the Sub-Treasury for* trans
fer to New Orleans. On the other hand the
eub-TreaFury paid out over half a million
dollars en account of gold deposits at San
Francisco and Seattle and made a payment of
13. 127 for redeemed bonds, thus clearing up
the last of the acceptances under the late offer
of the Secretary of the Treasury. Renewed
doubt as to the extent to which the foreign
demand for gold may go chilled all speculative
enthusiasm. Hones r.re pro Jessed that to-mor
row's dividend and interest disbursements will
soon came back to relieve the money market,
but this did not seem to revive any feeling of
cheerfulness In the stock market. Neither did
the announcement of the determination of the
treasury to i'l 11 111 bond purchases, altnougn
the inclusion in the offer of long fours is
likely to attract considerable tenders, Judging
by the experience of the -past summer. Among
the stocks advanced to-day without any special
reason assigned were Delaware. Lackawanna
and Hudson, a number of. the Vanderbilts and
Chesapeake and Ohio, the last on Philadelphia
orders attributed to Pennsylvania account.
Amalgamated Copper was depressed upon .the
inclusion of new plaintiffs in Montana suits
agairst the company. The stock closed above
the lowest. The Northern Pacific settlement
fell Into the background with th? heaviness
and neglect of the Pacific?, which continued to
the close and made the market easy. There
was considerable selling In United States
Steel, and Glucose and Smelting were weak.
' There were some strong spots in the bond
market, but the price movement was irregu
lar. Total sale.-,, $1.165, 000. United States
bonds were all unchanged on the last call.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market to-day was idle, in anticipa
tion of to-morrow's holiday. The rise in the
bank discount rat<? from 3 to 4 came as a sur
prise end suggests the belief that heavy money
demands are impending but the market was
glad to have the matter finally settled. Amer
ican stocks were firm with the coalers leading.
London regards New York gold exports as a
bull point, since thfy divert the French demand
from this center.

CHICAGO. Oct. 31.â Corn was given an im
pettis at the opening by Improved Liverpool
cables and December opened unchanged to *4@
%c higher at 57*;(g57;fcc. Wet weather in the
West prevented free movement of crops and
advanced prices and on small receipts shorts
began to* cover, soon sending December to 68c.
Advices indicated a poor average in quality and
quantity, being fed to stocK rrom the shock.
There was also a fair improvement in the
shiping demand and some news of lots taken
for export. Trade in the May delivery was
prominent. At the high price there was a set
back due to profit-taking and a quiet trade
until December sold back to its lower opening,
closing firm, %@U;C higher, at 55%@56c.
Wheat in the main had an easy feeling on
numerous bearish influences, but, supported by
corn, held well throughout the day. December
opened a shade lower to a shade higher at
70%@70%c on weaker cables. Primary receipts
were almost double those of the opening day
last year. Clearances also were small, but
upon the corn bulge December advanced quiet
ly to 70%#70%c, closing at that figure, %c
higher than yesterday.
There was t-ome activity in the oat pits fol
lowing the strength in corn. December cloÃed
firm, %c higher, at 37c.
Provisions were dull and steady. Prices were
unchanged at the opening, though there was
an easier feeling in the hogr market. January
pork closed unchanged lard 2%@5c lower and
ribs 2%c down.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The foreign markets showed little
change. A German authority estimated that
German import requirements would call for
100,000,000 bushels of Wheat and 33,000,000 bush
els of Rye.
Chicago was inactive but firm at an advance
of several fractions. Coarse grains were strong-,
particularly Corn, which helped Wheat. The
interior situation was extreme bullish. Kxports
were reported above the average, but specula
tion was slow. New York bought on cold
wave pfospects, but rains were reported over
the Mississippi basin. The elevator people sold.
Southwestern receipts were larger than last
year, something that has not been seen for
some time.
This market was lower and very dull on call,
but shipping grades remained without change.

BARLEY â The rise in futures on Wednesday
was caused by the advancing of the market by
an. operator who was long to the amount of
8000 or 10,000 tons of December, and who bid up
the market on the shorts. Tnis movement is
said to be speculative. There is, however, an
increasing steadiness all along the line, ac
companied with a corresponding improvement
in the demand, though the market is quiet at
best. Possibly, if cars were more available,
business would be better. Futures were dull
again yesterday.

THE EXECUTIVE
Colombians Are Con
spiring Against Act
ing President.
Affair Considered Serious
One for the Unstable
Country.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31.â Mall advices
received here contain brief reference to
a conspiracy having for its object the
ousting ef Vice President Marroquln, the
acting- executive of the Colombian repub
lic.
The couj> d'etat was scheduled to take
place on the 23d of September, and was
isald to be the outcome of dissatisfaction
p^fc-ith the existing Government regime. It
â¢ wm to have been participated in by an
element of thÂ« Liberal party and by two
of thÂ« branches of the Conservative party,
each of which wa* to have two repre
sentatives in the Cabinet of six members.
It â¢waÂ» proposed that after MarroQuln had
been deposed the former President was
to be tailed in office, there to remain
tor a, short time, after which General
Osploa, who had resigned his position as
Minister oÂ£ War. and who was said to be
implicated in the conspiracy, was to as
sume the office of President.
Aa shown by the press dispatches, how
ever, tan plot failed. General Ospina's
coanecticia with the alleged plot. Jt is
caid, -was after his resignation as Min
ister of War. resulting from the iate
Cabinet crisis while he was in that office,
as woulcl bÂ« the natural Inference from
the pres* dispatches. The whole affair Is
regarded as very unfortunate for Colom
bia In the present unsettled condition of
affairs In that country-
The Navy Department has made public
the following extract from a mall report
received under date of October 21 from
Captain Thomas Perry of the battleship
lowa, which has been lying at Panama
watching; the progress of affairs in that
quarter:
I bar* the honor to report that at this mo
ment activities are taking place on thÂ« part
of the liisuxretitt who have, until recently.
bÂ«*n In the neighborhood of Cnorrera. On Bat
urtar, October IS, it was reported that Chor
r*r* had seer evacuated by the Insurgents and
that several hundred of them had marched
from there toward Empire, a station on the
I .nama railroad, about twelve mile* from
"T mama. The Government sent a forge of
'â¢bout 160 men by rail from Panama said to be
destlaed for Empire and Culebra. ' Insurgents
were eeen on October *>, in email numbers, on
the hills -west of and near Panama. It Is
eaid this movement on the part of the insur
gents had been forced on them before they
were ready by the presence of smallpox in
their cerr-p at Chorrera, the disease atacking
their members to such a degree that they
were obliged to leave to save their entire force
from becoming hore de combat.
In the report of Lieutenant Commander Mc-
Cres, commanding the Machias. dated October
3. 1901. a copy of which was received by me
â¢?ter the original had been sent to the de
partment appears the following statement:
â¢General AJban is building stone barricades
m the outskirts of Panama toward La Boca "
This is t mistake, as no barricades have been
built cf nry material on the outskirts of Pan
ama.
Popularity of Buller Increases.
LONDON. Oct. Sl.â General Buller
threaters to biossom into a British Boul
anger. He does not appear to court pri
vacy or to discountenance demonstration*.
He attended a theater in London last
evening and when he was recognized and
cheered he rose to his feet and bowed his
acknowledgment*. Outside the building
General Buller was surrounded by cheer
ing crowds and the police had to be called
in tn floor a n-ir

â¢WHITE WINGS" CAHILL
PASSES AWAY AT OAKLAND
John Patrick Cahill, "White Wings," is
dead. There is not a baseball "fan" In
California, nor in the East, for the mat
ter of fiat, who will not learn with deep
regret >.f the passing of this old-time idol
of the diamond. He died yesterday of
-motion at the home of his mother
!n Oakland.
kahili was Immensely popular at the
H&Jpnt-street grounds of the old Califor
nia L^Â£4E-ue. where he played with the
Haverlys. He ranked with the best play
err and could fill any position, except that
of catcher. His favorite positions were
chortstcp and third base.
It was at Haight street he was given
.-he sobriquet of "White Wings." He
/Trade a sensational slide for- second base
resulted in disaster to his blua
Knickerbocker*. For the take of the pro
prieties he was compelled to retire back
ward to the clubhouse. He reappeared
shortly afterward attired in white knick
erbockers. The song "White Wings" was
popular at the time and the wags on the
nleacherÂ» commenced singing It. That
fixed his nickname.
Cahill went East In 1884 and played with
the Philadelphia Reds, at that time Phil
adelphia's record nine. The following
year he went to Atlanta, Ga., where he
captained the team.
Her* :ae was truly the popular idol. A
street wae named after him, likewise a
brand of cigars. He returned to this
coast and played under Colonel T. Peren
nial Robinson, on the Oakland team.
Since then he has played in Texas. Ari

MORLEY PLEADS
FOR THE BOERS
British Statesman Se
verely Condemns
War Policy.
LONDON', Oct. 31.â John Morley, M. P.. i
addressing his constituents to-day at j
Arbicath said:
The Government Is aggravating the essential
mischief of the situation in South Africa by
1tÂ» management of the concentration camps.
The death rate of children, measure It as you
will, is hideous, excessive and appalling. The,
policy of devastation has been admitted to be
a mistake.
I wonder what Lord Palmerston would have
said of a Government Justifying themselves by
say-Ing that Russia iji Poland and Austria In
Bosnia had done something like the same.
The war hae entirely changed in character,
and !Â« drifting into a war of extermination of
a p-ole fighting for their own land.
The policy of unconditional surrender and
submission means extermination and annihila
tion. The present attitude of the Government
is one of sullen desperation. There is nothing
worse than mettle in a blind ho.se. The King
wiil. perhaps at no distant date, have tÂ« seek j
other Ministers with a better insight and a
more pliant mind in the face of the dangerous
and complex situation which confronts the
country.
ALDERSHOT, Ofct. 31.â 1t is understood
that mm a result of the conclusion arrived
at by th 9 Cabinet Monday every available
Infantryman here will be sent to the front
between now and Christmas. The- troop

TOLICE WORK HARD
TO COLLECT EVIDENCE
OAKLAND, Oct. 31.â The police con
tinue to accumulate evidence against
members of the gang captured Tuesday
afternoon that fixes responsibility upon
them for recent burglaries. A junk dealer
has identified one of the number as hav
ing sold a lot or tools to him that wer.i
stolen from Sohsfs carriage factory sev
eral nights before the capture of the
crowd. Merchants and householders
throughout the city, as well as the po
lice, are happy lhat the nine are safely
behind the bars, for the evidence is strong
enough that they had started upon a
winter campaign of burglary. Among th.Â»
number under arrest aro several men who
could be used as a reconnoitering force,
paving the way for successful raids upon
homes and stores. At least three of the
nine will be directly connected with the
recent burglaries, and the detectives now
at work are satisfied several more of
their prisoners will have to defend them
selves against felony charges.

messages of appreciation for the work
that was done in rounding up the gang.

OAKLAND. Oct. 31.-The Mac
donough Theater was reopened
to-night after having been closed
during the greater part of the
present year. The people of Oak
land showed an Inclination to give the
new management of the theater a wel
come and they turned out in such num
bers that the entire theater was filled.
Not a seat was to be -had in any part of
the house when the curtain went up.
C P. Hall, lessee of the new theater,
and C. Henry, who is associated with him.

ing the preliminary arrangements. Mr.

PLAGUE INVADES
GLASGOW HOTEL
Three Cases of the Dis
ease Discovered in
the City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GLASGOW, Oct. 31.â The bubonic plague
has reappeared here. Four persons sus
pected to be suffering from the disease
were lately removed from the Central
Station Hotel. Subsequently three were
certified to have the plague and one died.
The hotel has been closed.
LIVERPOOL, Oct. 31.â Owing to the
precautions that have been taken against
the spread of the plague here the Con
suls have not yet recommended shipping
restrictions. The American Consul, after
communication with Washington, says
that American ports are not likely to bar
passengers from Liverpool.
BORDEAUX. Oct. 31.â Ministerial- in
structions have been received to disinfect
all vessels arriving at Bordeaux from Liv
erpool.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31â The United
States Consul at Liverpool has cabled to
the State Department that two cases of
bubonic plague and some other suspicious
cases have developed in a hospital in Liv
erpool. The facts were communicated to
the marine hospital service. Surgeon
General Wyman has cabled Past Assist
ant Surgeon Thomas, who did similar
work in the outbreak at Glasgow some
months ago, to proceed to Liverpool and
Investigate the outbreak and keep this
Government advised of the situation.
This is the first outbreak of plague in
Liverpool in the recollection of the au
thorities here. No immediate danger to
United States ports is apprehended, al
though there will be a much more rigor
ous examination of incoming vessels and
passengers from Liverpool by the health
authorities than heretofore. The official
reports received here do not indicate if
the ease's are of a .violent type.
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.â Dr. Doty, health
officer of the port of New York, is not
alarmed ever the fact that Liverpool has
been declared a plague infected port by
the Italian and French governments. He
said to-day that New York's health is
in no way threatened. He explained that
Liverpool has only two authenticated
cases of the bubonic plague, and these
were conveyed there from another pore,
being taken at once on their arrival to
the hospital, so that the general public is
in no sense involved.
Charged With Involuntary Homicide.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 31.â Allen Watsor.
the colored scorcher who ran down an-}
killed Norman Campbell, has been held
to answer to the Superior Court on the
unusual charge of involuntary homicide.
E. W. "Walker, his companion, was dis
charged. The evidence showed that the
two men had been racing down the street
at a furious rate of speed when they ra i
Jnto the children.
Oakland and his other theater properties
in Fresno. Sacramento and San Jose. It
is probable that Oakland will be the home
house for the circuit controlled by these
gentlemen.
The people of Oakland to-night proved
themselves ready to give encouragement
to the new management should they profit
by the mistakes that have been made with
the Macdonough in the past. The people
of Oakland are ready and anxious to
patronize their theater at home if the
proper encouragement is given them, but
there is no community that can let a
theatrical attraction so thoroughly alone
as can the people of Oakland if they feel
so Inclined. This has been demonstrated
to the satisfaction of several managers,
some of whom made successes and others
who did not.
The opening night was certainly all that
could be desired in point of numbers. The
play, "In Old Kentucky," has been pre
sented in Oakland before and has always
proved popular. Two more performances
will be given Friday and Saturday even
ings, but there will be no matinee.
IRE ENLIVENS
THE CONGRESS
Delegates to the Pan-
American in Exciting
Debate.
CITY OF MEXICO. Oct. 31.-The Pan-
American Congress has received from thÂ«?
Spanish colony at Buenos Ayres a cable
gram congratulating it upon the senti
ments favorable to Spain expressed by
General Rafael Reyes, delegate of Colom
bia at the municipal banquet.
The session this morning, which finally
resulted in the admission of the members
of the press to the sessions of the confer
ence, was very interesting. The first prep
osition submitted was that of Peru, whose
delegates asked that as many of the press
representatives as the hall would hold be
admitted, their number being left to the
discretion of the conference. This propo
sition was rejected by the votes of Chile,.
Colombia, Uruguay, the United States/
Mexico, Brazil, Haytl, Guatemala, Hon
duras, Salvador. Nicaragua and Costa
Ricaâ twelve votes against seven.
The next proposition, presented by
Chile, differing slightly from that of Peru,
was taken up. It had been expected that
Peru and its allies would vote against
Chile's proposition, which, united to the
votes of the delegates hostile to" the ad
mission of the press in any form, would
have defeated It. thus excluding newspa
per representatives. However, Senor Al
zamora, for Peru, supported Chile's pro
posal, saying. "We consider principle, noi
persons."
Senor Carbo of Ecuador jumped to his
feet and said that the last expression was
a reflection upon the other delegations ami
called on Alzamora to withdraw his
words. Alramora declined, antt the inci
dent was assuming a somewhat threaten
ing character when the president of the
congress. Senor Raigosora, intervened,
saying that he saw nothing censurable in
Alzamora's words.
Chile's proposal, owing to the action of
Peru, was adopted. There are those her-Â».
however, who say that Chile's reel object
was to defeat the admission of the press,
and that Peru's stand was a great sur
prise to Chilf.

COURT WANTS
NO REPETITION
Witnesses at Schley In
quiry Relieved From
Service.
Marine Corps Officer's Praise
Completes Admiral's
Case.
WASHINGTON, Oct. Sl.â ln the Scnley
court of inquiry to-day a number of wit
nesses were introduced by Judge Advocate
Lemly to testify in rebuttal of the evi
dence given in Admiral Schley'Â» behalf.
The court decided early in the day that no
witnesses could be introduced at this
stage of the proceedings to give testi
mony on immaterial points. This an
nouncement was made in connection with
an effort to prove a conversation on board
the Massachusetts, In which Lieutenant
Sears, who was Admiral Schley's flag lieu
tenant, was reported to have said:
"For God's sake don't discourage him
(meaning Commodore Schley), It's all that
we have been able to do to work him up
to this."
It had the effect of relieving Lieutenant
Commander Grant, Lieutenant Command
er Potts and other officers of the Massa
chusetts, who had been called to testify
concerning this conversation with Sears,
which is said to have occurred on the
Massachusetts just before the reconnois
sance of May 31.
Reiteration Is Barred.
On the other hand the court held that It
was not bound by the ordinary proceed
ings In civil cases aa to the time when
testimony can be taken and that wit
nesses might be called or recalled at any
time for the purpose of making additions
to former statements, but that none of
them could reiterate testimony previously
given. This decision was rendered out of
an objection raised by Raynor to allowing
Captain Sigsbee to give new testimony
when called as a witness for rebuttal pur
poses.
The witnesses called in rebuttal were:
Captain Charles D. Sigsbee, Captain
French E. Chadwick, Captain Joseph G.
Eaton, Lieutenant John H. Roys and
Chief Quartermaster Neil Anderson, all
of whom testified to the incidents con
nected with the^ campaign of 1898.
Captain Chadwick in his statement to
day said that the precautionary dispatches
from the Navy Department in regard to,
attacking the Spanish shore batteries had
not been communicated to Commodore
Schley. This statement is regarded as of
great importance by Admiral Schley's op
ponents, as it distinctly contradicts the
admiral's own statements.
Sigsbee on the Stand.
Captain Sigsbee testified concerning his
Interview on the Brooklyn with Commo
dore Schley. Captain Eaton was the com
mander of the dispatch boat Resolute dur
ing the war and his testimony related
largely to events which occurred just be
fore and just after the battle of July 3.
Lieutenant Roys served on board the
Eagle and his statement bore upon the
Eagle's meeting with the Brooklyn when
the latter was en route to Cienfuegos and
again while the flagship lay off that port.
He stated that Lieutenant Commander
Southerland had asked not to' be sent to
Port Antonio for coal and had asked to be
allowed to coal from the Merrimac.
Anderson was chief quartermaster of
the Brooklyn during the Spanish war and
was at the wheel during the battle of July
3. He said that Commodore Schley had
given the order of "hard aport," but that
when the order was given the vesel was
then hard aport.
Before these witnesses were introduced
for the department the court heard Cap
tain T. S. Borden of the Marine Corps,
who served on the Brooklyn, in Admiral
Schley's behalf. He was the last of the
admiral's witnesses and he testified that
the admiral had borne himself honorably
during the battle of July 3.
ER33S3LAUER ARRESTED ON
EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGE
He Claims It Is Owing to a Discrep
ancy in an Account for
Wool.
J. B. Monroe, a wool grower of Wood
ville, Tulare County, secured a warrant
from Judge Cabaniss yesterday afternoon
for the arrest of L. Breslauer of L, Bres
lauer & Co., wool merchants, 49 Bluxome
street, on the charge of felony embezzle
ment. The amount alleged in the com
plaint to have been embezzled is $626 09.
Monroe has been around the Hall of
Justice since Monday endeavoring to get
the warrant. The police referred him to
the District Attorney's office and Assist
ant District Attorney Alford took the
matter in hand and finally gave instruc
tions that the warrant should be irsued.
Breslauer was arrested yesterday after
noon, but was soon released on bonds.
His statement, which is corroborated by
his partner, is to the effect that the
trouble grows out of a dispute as to a
discrepancy in an account of $1079 for
wool. Breslauer & Co. had offered to set
tle with Monroe, but he wanted more
money than the firm contended was due
him.
No Bond Was Filed.
BERKELEY. Oct. 31.â The California
nd Nevada Railroad line through this
flty, at present owned by the town
through the forfeiting of Its franchise
by the road, will probably be returned to
the company at the meeting of the trus
tees to-morrow night on the road's pay
ment of back taxes. The company
agreed Monday to pay the taxes, amount
ing to $999 97, on the return of the fran
chise, but the Trustees refused and en
deavored to get a $5000 bond, which the
company was supposed to have put up as
a matter of good faith. The bond cpn
not be found, and Samuel Heywood, who
was president of the Trustees at the time
the road was built, has no recollection
of the bond being filed, nor do the town
records show that it was. As the Trus
tees cannÂ«t get the bond they will be
satisfied v.'ith the taxes.
Â£. W. Maslin's Resignation.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 31.â E. W. Maslln has
tendered his resignation as vice presi
dent and director of the Unitarian
Club, and the same has been accepted.
Mr. Maslin Is a member of the b^ard of

for the library is completed, he feels,
will recuire all his spare time and at
tention. _.

WOMAN AND JAPANESE ALMOST
PERISH IN JONES-STREET FIRE
Suspicious Circumstances Surround Origin of the
Blaze and an Investigation Will Be Made as to
the Cause of Conflagration by the Authorities
FIRE in a boardingr-house at 802
Jones street caused excitement In
the uptown hotel section shortly
after 9 o'clock last evening. Its
origin is a mystery. The flames
gained headway so rapidly that two peo
ple were overcome by smoke before they
could gain an exit. Both were rescued.
Mrs. Hattie Towne, the aged mother of
Percy Towne, an attorney with R. H.
Lloyd, was rescued by A. P. Girard, son
of Colonel Girard. She was picked up in
a hallway where she had fallen. A Jap
anese servant was hemmed in by the
flames and was carried out by H. Harris,
a shipping clerk, who found him almost
suffocated in the basement.
The house â¢was owned by Mrs. Mitchen.
This lady had arrived home but three
minutes before the fire was reported to
her. Then the basement was ablaze and
a passerby had rushed to the nearest
alarm box to ring the alarm.
The flre gained rapid headway and
smoke filled the house. Mrs. Mitchen ran
into the street and shouted to the crowd
of gathering spectators that there were
other people in the burning structure.
Girard started up the stairway leading
the prime reason for the company's pur
chase of the property.
There Is a possibility that two stories
will be added to the present height of the
yellow building when the new structure
is erected.

to the front door. As he did so he heard
a woman's scream. The smoke waa so
dense In the hall that he was obliged to
grope his way along. He had gone some
distance when he stumbled over the pros
trate form of Mrs. Towne.
The aged lady was in her room on the
second floor when she became aware that
the house was on fire. When she opened
the door leading into the hallway the
smoke was clouding up from the basement
and she was unable to see her way. By
groping around she found the stairway
and managed to stagger to the bottom of
it, where she fell insensible.
. H. Harris, a shipping clerk, was riding
home on a Jones street car. He saw the
flames in the basement windows and
heard a Japanese shouting Inside. Break
ing a window Harris tried to reach the
imprisoned man. Failing in this he broke
down a door and after several minutes
grasping the prostrate servant dragged
him into the street.
Fire Marshal Towe is investigating the
origin of the fire. The Japanese em
ployed by Mrs. Mitchen, It Is claimed, was
at night school when the flames broke
out. The servant who was dragged from
the house in a half-suffocated condition
is employed by a family in a house ad-
Joining. Despite the fact that he was
rescued by Harris the Japanese denied
that he was in the house.
Mrs. Mitchen says she uses no lamps;
that the place is entirely lighted by gas.
One theory advanced is that a cigarette
carelessly discarded started the fire, but
the fire marshal and police intend to
make an investigation. The loss is about
$5000.
FEMALE "UNIT
WORKER " CAUGHT
Marie Smith Is Finally
Run Down by the
Police.
A well-dressed, middle-aged woman
giving the name of Marie Smith was ar
rested yesterday afternoon by r>etectives
Dinan and Wren, and charged with ob
taining money by false pretenses. For
some time past Mrs. Smith has been col
lecting various sums of money from char
itably inclined Individuals on the repre
sentation that the amount was to go to
the Uttle Sisters' and Infants' Shelter.
Yesterday Captain Seymour was told that
the woman was an impostor, and he de
tailed Dinan and Wren to arrest here.
By. dint of inquiry the detectives learned
that Mrs. Smith was in the vicinity of the
wholesale district "working" unsuspect
ing merchants, and they started after her.
Recognizing her as she left the office of
Robert Dollar of the Usal Redwood Com
pany at 204 Front street, they placed her
under arrest and took her to police head
quarters. In her pocket was found $5
which she had obtained from Mr. Dollar
on the false representation that it was to
be used in helping defray the expenses
of the Little Sisters' institution. The
woman was accompanied by a nine-year
old boy, who, she claimed, was her son.
To Captain Seymour Mrs. Smith said
that her husband had died some time ago
and that she was forced to take in sew
ing to support herself and child. Refer
ring to the charge against her she said:
"If I have done anything wrong I did
not mean to. Several weeks ago I met a
woman, who told me her name was Mrs.
Wright, in a coffee saloon on Eddy street,
where I generally have breakfast. After
a short conversation she informed me
that she was connected with the Little
Sisters' Shelter and that she wanted me
to help her in arranging a benefit for the
institution, as it was heavily in debt. She
gave me a book, on tho fly leaf of which
she wrote that I was authorized to col
lect funds for the proposed benefit. I
admit that I collected several hundred
dollars for the benefit, but I defy any
body to prove that I obtained it under
false pretenses."
Shortly after the woman had been ar
rested the detectives went to her room
and found a memorandum book showing
that she had collected more than $500 for
the alleged benefit. Written on the fly
leaf were the words: "We hereby certify
that Mrs. Wright is authorized to collect
money for the benefit of the Little Sisters'
and Infants' Shelter at 512 Minna street.
(Signed.) Mrs. W. Pierson, president; Mrs.
J. A. Sampson, secretary."
Investigation revealed that Mrs. Pier
son's name had been forged and that Mrs.
Sampson had been dead over three years.
The alleged Mrs. Wright, whose name ap
pears in the book, is supposed to be a
myth.
Among the woman's victims are' the fol
lowing:
John Rosenfeld's Sons, $5; L. T. I^asretto
$3 50; Alaska Commercial Company, $5; A. L.
Bryan Shoe Company. $2 oO; Jesse Moore-Hunl
Company, $5; Alaska Packers" Association, fo;
Pacific Tool and Supply Company, %" 50; Stock
ton Milling Company. $2 50, and the Fidelity
Mutual Aid Association, $2 50.
The name of Frank J. Carolan, the well
known clubman, is also written in the
book, but investigation showed that it is
a forgery.
TRIES TO KILL HERSELF
WITH A BIG REVOLVER
Gertie Wilson Does Not Care to Live
After Desertion by Man She
Loved.
Gertie Wilson, a young woman who has
been flitting about the tenderloin for th<;
last few years, tried to end her unhappy
existence with a gullet at about 6 o'clock
last night. Gertie's aim was rather bad,
and she is now in the Receiving: Hospital.
Love, broken promises and ail that sort
of thing led to the young woman's at
tempt at a tragic ending in front of Ed
Wilson's cigar store at 131 O'Farrell
street. Wilson, whose real name is Ed
v.ard Gosliner, has been living with the
wouid-bt suicide, according to her story,
for years, but recently he transferred his
affections to another. Two nights ago
(jertie wrote letters, one addressed to an
evening paper and another to a sister,
Mrs. Katie Dunn of Reno, Nev. In these
letters she told of her contemplation of
suicide. She also wrote to Wilson, telling
him that if he did not return to her she
would kill herstlf. Last night she went
to Wilson's store, and when ordered out
by a clerk she declared lie would have to
carry her out.
\ ith that she drew a big revolver and
fired a. shot which pierced her bosom. She
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where the bullet was extracted. The
wound is not dangerous. The woman says
she gave Wilson the money with which to
start in business, and that he promised
to marr;- her.
Henarie Will Contest Settled.
Judge Coffey yesterday granted the pe
tition of Heziah Henarie and William
Radjesky for the partial distribution of
the estate of the late D. V. B. Henarie
who died November 28, 1899, leaving an
estate valued at $383,000. The court also
granted the motion to set aside the pe
tition to revoke the probation of the will
made by Mary A. Henarie, widow of the
deceased liquor dealer, who, since the pe
tition was presented, has passed away
This practically settles the legal battles
over the estate which have been carried
on since the will was filed.
Shoe Thief Sentenced.
William Jackson, a colored man, was
sentenced to six months in the County
Jail by Judge Mogan yesterday on the
charge of petty larceny. He entered thc
store of Williams-Marvin Company sts9
Market street, and stole eight pair's of
shoes, which were found in his possession
when arrested.
LUNACY BOARD
TAKES A HAND
Troubles at St. Elmo
Hospital Subject of

Dr. Hatch Is Prepared to
Make Necessary In
vestigations.

Alexander Murdock, the superintendent,
was asked on Wednesday to tell who
were the directors of the institution, but
said he could not recall them all at the
time. Yesterday he gave the following
written statement to a Call reporter:
As per your request, St. Elmo Hospital-
John Russell. J. M. Dunne, W. McCarthy, T.
C. Collins Joseph Duffy, one share each; Alex
Murdock, 1600 shares. Total of shares. 25M
at $10 a share balance of stock not yet Issued ;
Â¦we rent from Maclean Hospital with a pros
pect of purchasing. Corp. books can be seen.
ALKX MURDOCK,
Superintendent St. Elmo Hospital.
What Superintendent Says.
When Murdock was interviewed on
Wednesday afternoon he denied that S.
P. Blumenberg, erstwhile managing direc
tor of the Hotel Nymphia, had anything
to do with the management of the St.
Elmo Hospital. Before Murdock assumed
control of the hospital he was bookkeeper
for the Gordon Sanitarium and collected
the rents from inmates of the Hotel Nym
phia.
How Blumenberg got control of Bt.
Elmo Hospital is best told in suit No.
76,047, filed in the Superior Court a few
days ago. This is an action wherein W.
P. Reed appears as plaintiff against the
Maclean Hospital, a corporation, and its
directors. A large number of reputable
physicians are made defendants. The
story in brief is as follows:
In March, 1894, an action was com
menced by E. J. Malmgren and D. J.
Lawrence against J. T. Harris and Dr.
M. H. Logan. Dr. Logan, one of the de
fendants, had purchased 1400 shares of
the capital stock and indorsed a note for
one Harris. During the absence in the
East of Dr. Logan judgment waa obtained
against him. Later a renewal of the
judgment was obtained, and one L. Nath
an bought in Dr. Logan's stock for $2.
This was later transfered to Blumenberg.
The physicians who were associated with
Dr. Logan in the enterprise claim they
were not advised of the proceedings. Soon
thereafter Blumenberg assumed full con
trol, and elected a number of serviceable
tenderloin habitues as trustees. One of
the directors is the husband of Elizabeth
Dunn, who owns considerable property in
the disreputable quarter of the city and
who has frequently figured in the Police
curts. Of another director of the St.
Elmo Hospital but little is known, save
from the Police Court record. Murdock
formerly collected the nightly rentals
from the unfortunates that occupied tho
apartments in the Hotel Nymphia. He
has held a number of positions in cor
porations organized by Blumenberg for
controlling the money to be derived from
the habitues of the quarter in which
Blumenberg operates.
Question About Certificate.
\Blumenberg has a certificate entitling
him to practice medicine, but how he got
it is a question that the examiners of the
Institution say they are unable to explain.
Under the guise of this diploma Blumen
berg has been working.
When Dr. Frizell was selected as resi
dent physician of St. Elmo Hospital he
was told that if he worked the first two
weeks for nothing he would be paid $300
a month thereafter. His first month was
up the night he was discharged, and he is
still looking for hia money.
A number of the physicians who were
interested in the Maclean Hospital are
considering- ways and means to expose
the Blumenberg method. An appeal to
the Grand Jury has been prepared and
will be placed in the hands of the com
mittee in the next few days.
Another matter the directors are inves
tigating is the alleged sale of the furni
ture and fixtures of the asylum. It is
said that Dr. Frizell was requested to
read off the list of articles in the asylum
when Blumenberg obtained control. .A
few of the attaches were present, and as
each lot of articles was read off Murdock
said. "I'll take this," or "I'll take that."
The same plan was pursued in disposing
of the stock.
Dr. Frizell and some of the former di
rectors have addressed a letter to the
foreman of the Grand Jury, asking a full
investigation of the management of the
hospital.
Perjury Before the Commissioner.
John Savory was discharged yesterday
by United States Commissioner Manley
after preliminary examination on a
charge of having accepted $5 from E.
Conheim. a sailor, as a fee for obtaining
employment for Conheim. Savory swore
that Conheim had committed perjury
when he testified that he gave Savory
$5, and that all that Conheim gave him
WU a cheap cigar. Shipping Master Cap
tain Austen testified that Savory had of
fered to pay him for giving Conheim em
ployment. "Owing to the conflict of testi
mony the Commissioner discharged Sav
ory.

DAY IS SPENT IN THE NOME CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS
IN SEVERE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF WITNESS FROST
CA. S. FROST, the younp man
with many governmental titles,
publicly announced during the
3 morning -session of the Nome
contempt proceedings yesterday
that he had troubles of his own and that
he was busy with them. E. S. Plllsbury.
amicus curlae, heard the statement, and
the work of the day before Commissioner
Heacock was an attempt to uncover all
the troubles that fell to Frost's lot while
in the rold Arctic country.
The proceedings opened with a continu
ation of the direct examination by
Attorney Heney. This was soon
ended, and Plllsbury began the cross-ex
amjnatlon with alacrity and rapidity. But
he soon struck a snag. After asking the
witness a question or two founded on the
Lekely affidavit Frost shied out of the
road and the attorneys, audience and
Commissioner filed out of the room and
into the Circuit Court of Appeals to lay
the matter before Judges Morrow, Gilbert
and Hawley.
The question to be argued was whether
or not Ir'illsbury had the right to take an
affidavit ana ask tne witness if there was
any statement in it which he knew to be
false. The bulk of the affidavit was hurled
at- Frost and he rebelled. So aid his at
torneys. After deliberation the court
ruled that while the question was not in
the best form the witness should read the
amd.'ivit and point out such passages as
he believed to be divergencies from the
truth. This was done and the morning
session was consumed.
Appointment of Detectives.
The work of the afternoon was confined
to the detectives Frost appointed, the rea
son for their appointment and what he
knew of the arrest of McKenzle and the
bank disturbance. Frost was very delib
erate in his testimony and recited events
with a care. Despite this the amicus
curiae thinks he has brought out several
important discrepancies.
Frost appointed detectives while he was
special examiner to ferret an attempt at
corruption in the impaneling of a jury. For
this reason he says he appointed George
Carson and L. D. McLaine, and their re
ports were turned over to the District
Attorney's office. He said:
"It came to my mind that namea were
being furnished for a jury panel. It was
to find the person who was to furnish the
names and corrupt panel that Carson was
appointed. I heard In St. Michael on
July 25 and 26 that attempts would be
made to corrupt the jury panel for the
August term of the court and that names
were being furnished."
â¢'Who furnished the information?" In
quired Pillsbury.
"That is a confidential matter which I
cannot tell you," responded the witness.
"What instructions did you give these
detectives?"
"I told them what I heard without di
recting them to watch any particular peo
ple. The reports made to me were confi
dential."
"They were filed in the District Attor
ney's office and were accessible to all,
were they not?"
"No, sir; they were kept in the District
Attorney's private box, which but few
had access to."
"How long did these investigations con
tinue?"
"Until October."
"During that time was any jury
drawn?"
"About the 22d of August. "
"When did you first speak to Wood
about it?"
"I don't remember what the occasion
was or .the exact time of It, " responded
Frost.
About Jury Frauds.
According to the testimony the gTand
and trial Jury had been drawn when the
300 names were selected. Frost said they
tried to get interested persons on the Jury.
"Did you ever make any inquiry about
this matter in the clerk's office, or did
you ever report any dereliction of duty
in the clerk's office?" queried Pillsbury.
"No, sir." answered the witness.
It was the duty of the clerk to furnish
150 names, the jury commission the other
150. The witness drew within the shell of
confidential communication, saying that
information in this matter came from an
official residing at Nome, and he refused
to divulge the name.
"Did you V.ne any information relating
to the clerk?" continued the amicus
curiae.
"Not at that time," was the reply.
"Any concerning the action of a jury
commissioner on the subject?"
Another declination followed.
Judge Noyes and Frost discussed this
matter about the corruption of the jury
panel. . Frost said Judge Noyes showed
him an affidavit stating that certain per
sons had been furnishing lists of names
for the panel, the lists being in the hand
writing of a person whom he knew.
"Who was the commissioner who drew
the 150 names?" asked Pillsbury.
"I think it was Major Strong," respond
ed Frost.
"Did Judge Noyes tell you where he ob
tained these lists?"
"They were attached to the affidavits."
The witness then testified that Noyes
