Then began a series of questions on Mc-
Laughlln's part which went to the mak
ing of the three affidavits by Hume. A
"To whom?"
Creek claims. Some discrepancies exist
between this affidavit and Hume's direct
testimony.
The witness denied having made the
affidavit, or .at least having signed his
name to it and being cognizant of the
facts contained in it. The third affidavit,
that of June 18, is voluminous and full of
such facts as were brought out in the
testimony, with an occasional discrep
ancy. This, Pillsbury, according to ths
suppositions of respondent's attorneys,
is supposed to have received from Nome.
"Were there any other conversations
with Judge Noyes in regard to the writ
of supersedeas?" began Judge McLaugh
lin at the opening of the morning session.
' "I haven't any recollection of other
meetings," said Hume.

"When did you first tell this story that
you related here?"
"I think that it was in the spring of
1901; no, in the summer of 1900, in Au

the attorneys over" the' rights of the wit-

"Did you make another affidavit before
Mr. Bruner. about 'the 15th day of July?"
"Did you at that time make an affi

"No, sir."
"Did you make one at that time for nny
purpose?"
"Some time after the conversation with
Fincke and Orton, Fincke asked me. if I
would make an affidavit for Mr. Pillsbury.
I had no. objections and' made one."
"Have you seen a copy of that since?"
"Yes, In Mr.' Metson's office, i This af
fidavit was made In 'June, -1901:" '

"No, sir." . ;
"I arrived in San Francisco about Sep
tember 30 of this year and was advised
to call upon Mr. Pillsbury and was Inter
viewed by him.". . r '\u25a0-.
discussion arose between Attorneys Mc-
Laughlin and Pillsbury whether or not
the witness should acknowledge the mak
ing of these affidavits without the pro
duction of the instruments. After much
argument Pillsbury finally won .out, the
papers were produced. and identified by
the witness, all but the October affidavit,
which Hume would not admit to be genu
ine.
Then McLaughlin went at the witness
for facts concerning his relations with
Pillsbury. To the first question Hume re
plied:
When shown the affidavit of July 15 the
witness, declared that that was: not his
affidavit. After reading It he said he did
not swear to any such statement of facts.
"I have no recollection of this affidavit,
was not at the courthouse on that day
and did not sign that affidavit before John
P. Reed. I heard that something of this
sort washout, and I have-taken pains to
make sure of .where I was on .that day.
I will not swear that this is not my sig
nature, but I have no recollection of how
it came there. I never swore to the fact3
on page three, knowing the statements to
be as they are. I might sign a paper not
knowing the contents,' relying upon the
honesty of the person presentlng.lt."
McLaughlin then offered the affidavit in
evidence and it was introduced and la
beled, ."Exhibit 1, respondent Noyes." TIm
morning session ended with the reading cf
the affidavits in the record.

Authorities at "Washington Inclined
to Believe That Miss Stone Has
Been Killed.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. IC.
W. t WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.â Though
Mr. Eddy, secretary of the American
Legation in Constantinople, is Indirectly
in communication with the brigands sup
posed to hold Miss Stone captive, no
word concerning the condition of the
woman has been received by the State
Department for some days. This lack of
information leads many of the Washing
ton authorities to believe that she is
dead. The State Department officials,
however, still cling to the hope that she
is yet alive. They believe that informa
tion of her death would be promptly
communicated to them. Convinced that
the Turkish and Bulgarian troops will not
attack as the result of representations of
the United States, the brigands are prob
ably awaiting the production of the entire
amount of ransom originally demanded.
The State Department continues to urge
the Boston Board of Missions to endeavor
to collect the sum required.
LONDON. Oct. 18.â The Globe this after,
noon says it fears that the safety of Miss
Ellen M. Stone Is seriously compromised
by the attitude of Consul General Dick
inson in refusing to pay the ransom and
in demanding that Bulgaria arrest the
loaders of the Macedonian Committee as
the real authors of the missionary's ab
duction. The paper says the situation con
tains all the factors of a grave interna
tional complication and threatens to as
sume Importance far beyond the person
ality of any individual missionary.

HOPE TO CALL INTO QUESTION THE CREDIBILITY OF THE TESTIMONY; GIVEN BY W.- T. HUME
AGAINST JUDGE NOYES BEFORE UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER HEACOCK. . . -.\u25a0..-. -
The affidavit of October 20 was appar
ently a surprise to Hume when presented.
It contains an account of Hume's efforts
to find the clerk of the court, with whom
he wished to file the complaints and
orders for the receiverships of the Anvil
The affidavits were the central point of
the day's proceedings. There are three of
them â one executed on the 20th day of
October, 1900, the second on June 18, 1901,
and the third on July 15, 1901. The July
affidavit is in the handwriting: and bears
the signature of Hume. It follows:
That reserving from the effect of this affi
davit any statement made to me by Alexander
McKenzie, I will state that I do not know
of my own knowledge, nor have I been in
formed, nor do I believe, that Arthur H.
Noyes has as presiding Judge of the District
Court for District of Alaska, Second Division,
received any money or pecuniary considera
tions, nor demanded the same to influence any
decision. Judgment or decree rendered or to be
rendered by him as such Judge. .<
Francis J. Heney fell Into the attorneys'
battle over these same affidavits. He act
ed as reader, and after using his voice
for a good half-hour expressed a soulful
desire to shirk the reading of the rest of
the document. The amicus curiae was
not of the same mind, so the reading went
on. Heney accused Pillsbury of an at
tempt to try the cases in the newspapers
and wanted the affidavits ; read for the
benefit of the reporters. Pillsbury was re
lentless, so court, court reporter, attor
neys and all had to listen.
SOME HUME AFFIDAVITS.
So far the attorneys have been courte
ous almost to an extreme, but yesterday
afternoon a bit of testiness was displayed
which is likely to lead to an occasional
fling of sarcasm. This testimony taking
before a Commissioner offers but little
opportunity for the interposition of ob
jections by attorneys.
Once during the morning session, when
an affidavit and the identity of a signa
ture was called into question, Pillsbury
expressed a desire to go downstairs and
have It out before the Judges of the Cir
cuit Court of Appeals. McLaughlin did
not press matters and the crossfire went
on.
noon he was the target for
questions on cross and redirect examina
tion before Commissioner Heacock, and as
yet his sensational, startling evidence
given against Noyes, McKenzie and "Wood
remains practically unshaken.
tiume was taken in hand at the begin
ning of the morning session by Judge Mc-
Laughlin. He' displayed the same cool,
self-possessed, and cautious spirit which
characterized his manner on the stand
during the proceedings of the first day.
On the face of it his testimony has a
damaging look to Noyes, but the latter's
attorneys smile and cry "Hearsay, hear
say." That will be their plea, and they
are working toward that end at present
In this cross-examination. An attack
against Hume's credibility was made yes
terday by the Introduction of three affi
davits, all of which were read into the
records and labeled as exhibits in the
case. Hume did some clever unimpeached
explaining of these affidavits, and when
the afternoon session closed the - amicus
curiae, E. S. Pillsbury, had him well in
hand reciting instances of Judge Noyes'
peculiar methods of distributing justice.
The evidence of yesterday brought forth
no startling new facts, except in the re
direct examination, when Hume began to
recite the instances which led him to a
belief in Judge Noyes' corruptibility.
WT. HUME, star witness in
the Nome contempt cases,
had another day of it in
_ the witness ~ chair yester
â¢ day. Morning and after-
PROTECTED HIS CLIENTS.
The rest of the afternoon was consumed
by an attempt on Pillsbury's part to show
by a redirect examination that .Hume's
reasons for his withdrawal from the
Noyes-McKenzle combination were found
ed on the broad principles of honesty.
"At the time I acquiesced to McKen
zle's propositions," said Hume, "it was
only a resort to protect my clients. At
that time I did not anticipate the full
scope of the scheme. In course of three
weeks, when I discovered the full facts
and meaning, I then tried to retire and
practically' did retire from any connection
with â¢ McKenzie, "Wood and that entire
combination.
Hume also wished to correct the state
ment that the affidavit of October 20 was
not founded on fact in its entirety. He
admitted that some of the statements were
true, but he said that on the date of the
execution he wasOirrying the burden of
the law office, and it was just possible he
signed -without reading the paper clearly.
Pillsbury then took the witness and
"Did you know of a letter written and
signed by Fincke or by Johnson or by
Jackson, addressed to Pillsbury, detailing
service you had been to them in getting
the facts and asking Pillsbury to use his
offices to protect you in the district of
the northern part of the country?"
"I never knew cf it, never sought pro
tection of any kind because I committed
no offense^ If it was written I can con
ceive of a reason for it, for I knew of a
change in the atmosphere at home which
changed the opinion of these men in re
gardÂ«to my conduct In Nome in the sum
mer of 1900."
McLaughlin then asked Pillsbury for the
letter, If he had it in his possession. The
latter said that he did not recollect it, but
If he had he would certainly produce it.
McLaughlin wanted to make doubly sure,
so he asked Pillsbury In the event of his
having sent \ the, letter in question to
Washington would ho look over his letter
copies and favor him with a reproduction.
Pillsbury was . trebly sure that he sent
nothing to Washington.
"I recall this : much," said Pillsbury.
"Private papers were sent to me, but they
were'lost from the mail or maybe stolen."
McLaughlin. pressed the Washington
business further, but Pnlsbury flatly de
nied any connection with the Washington
end of things.
"Personally, I have nothing against
Judge Noyes, but on account of my
knowledge of what I have suffered at the
hands of Noyes, Woods and McKenzIe in
making the one mistake of my life, I
have interested myself in this case. Judge
Noyes has done much to provoke my offi
cial interest In the matter. I did not be
lieve him honest."
McLaughlin did not like this, so he
moved to have the 'matter obliterated
from the record as not responsive to his
questions.
"Did Mr. Fir.cke, Mr. Johnson or Ken
neth M. Jackscn ever say they -would see
that you would be immuned from prose
cution for the making of the affidavit for
Mr. Pillsbury?"
"No, sir."
"No, sir,", was Hume's ready reply.
"Have you suggested names of parties
who would or who would not make affi
davits in this case?" Hume, said he had
not. and then continued: .
HTTlffE AND P3XLSBTJRY.
, "Have you been promised immunity
from prosecution of contempt if you tes
tified as you have?" said Judge McLaugh

BEAR ALMIEAL EVANS
TO ARRIVE HERE SUNDAY
The fact that the Navy Department has
deemed it necessary to send officers of
high rank to Tutuila for the purpose of
Inquiring Into the alleged mismanage
ment of affairs by Tilley is an Indication
that the department knows enough facts
to warrant this very unusual and expen
sive undertaking. The administration is
humiliated by the thought that the effort
to Americanize its colony in the Samoan
Islands has been thwarted by the misbe
havior of one who was supposed to stand
for what is best In American citizenship.
It seems that Commander Tilley was
at Tutuila only two and a half months
out of a year during the time that he
was supposed to be Its Governor ani
his presence was, through his habits, a
distinct misfortune. According to the
charges, he not only did not do his duty
by the natives but made It impossible for
others to fulfill these duties and meet the
wishes and expectations of the American
Government. Aside from the moral fail
ure at Tutuila it is charged against Tilley
that from $20,000 to $30,000 worth of land
was bought by him for the Government
without authority and paid for In notes
which have .since gone to protest. As a
result of this mismanagement natives
and traders have been ruined and dissat
isfaction has ensued.
The Secretary for Native Affairs whom
Tilley appointed is an Englishmanâ one
Gurr. To say that the commander's fail
ure to appoint an American to the posi
tion created surprise among the Ameri
can colony is expressing it but mildly.
Government Is Humiliated.
Absent From Post of Duty.
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct. IS.â The news
that Commander B. F. Tilley, U. S. N.,
Governor of Tutuila, Samoan Islands, and
commanding the collier Abarenda, had
been detached through charges preferred
by missionaries was a sensational sur
prise to the friends and associates of that
officer. His previous record was so clear,
so strong and so thoroughly satisfactory
that it seemed impossible he should have
at this late stage imperiled his reputa
tion and even his position by almost in
explicable conduct. He graduated at the
head of his class at the Naval Academy
and within a few days has been commis
sioned a captain. It has leaked out that
the charges against him include misbe
havior with native women, intoxication
at his station at Apia, at Auckland and
on hla ship, and a reckless disregard of
his duties as an officer and gentleman.
The charges are doubly mortifying frdaa
the fact that the German officials at Apia
have achieved a distinct success In the
management of that colony. By care,
skill and tact the Germans have pushed
i Apia ahead on social, educational and
business lines. In sad contrast Tutuila,
except for the good work of subordinates,
has gained little from American occupa
tion.

"I noticed her a little abaft our starboard
beam. Captain Clark at the same time noticed
her and called my attention to her and told
me to look out and avoid a collision. No col
lision was very imminent, but we did change
our helm and passed on. I did not see any
more of the Iowa. After the action com
menced we passed the Texas. The only ehip
then ahead of us was the Brooklyn. She was
well off her accustomed position, well off to
the westward. All the Spanish ships had
g-ot out by this time and we were pursuing
them, heading for the leading ship. We noticed
the Maria Teresa drop astern at less speed
than at first, saw flames leaping up and out
from her. which convinced us she was on fire
a few minutes after that the Oquendo appeared
to be covered with smoke and we concluded
that she also was on fire, which proved to be
a fact Just about this time the Viscaya
which starboarded her helm, seemed to head
off to the southward and went toward the
Brooklyn and fell out of line. It then became
evident that the Colon was pulling out of bat
tle aad running along the shore, but it was
developed that she was running away and had
more speed than all the other ships The
Viscaya headed toward the Brooklyn. She ran
that course for some time and then straightened
out again; then turned inshore and in a few
minutes after that ran ashore also. There is
no doubt about the Viscaya pulling out of the
Spanish line to the southward, because a short
time after this Captain Clark turned around
and called my attention tc some objects in
the water that looked like floating buoys an
parently three or four f*et above the water
We thoucht they were nets with torpedoes'
being probably thrown out to injure the ship
I ported the helm and before I could do any
thing we passed over the spot and found that
we were in the wake of the Viscaya."
Commander Nicholson then' detailed the chase
of the Colon, the subsequent roing ashore arid
"Well Done, Oregon."
"Occupying the position I did during the day
of the engagement, I necessarily' saw consider
able of it. The Incidents of that day com
menced about S:SO or five minutes before, when
the first call to quarters had been sounded.
Then the Spanish ships v. - ere seen coming out
of the harbor: were seen, in fact, by practically
the whole crew at the same time. When the
first ship started to go around the cry went
up. 'There they go." I looked toward the har
bor and eaw the first ship. Her bow was
making a turn into the last reach of the harbor
on her way out. She was followed in succes
sion by the others. I went to my station, first
on the bridge, then down to the conning tower,
and saw that the proper connections were made.
In the meantime the signal had been sounded
to general quarters and by this time steam was
coming up, all the boilers and blowers were
going full tilt and a few minutes afterward
Captain Clark came up. We turned the ship,
going glowly at first, the speed increasing all
the time; turned with a starboard helm and
started in toward the enemy. They came out
at full speed, apparently much faster than we
were at that time. By the time we were
straightened out well to the westward they
were all ahead of us. The Iowa started in, she
being to the westward of us apparently got in
closer to the enemy than we did. because we
passed under her stern. A few minutes after
that, on our course to the westward, we passed
under the stern of the Texas, apparently still
in the water. I called Captain Clark's atten
tion to this. Of course, firing commenced on
both eides at the time the first ship cleared
the mouth of the harbor. We returned the fire
at long range, probably from three and a half
to four miles off at that point. When we
crossed under the Texas' stern we saw the
Iowa coming out on a course nearly parallel
to a converging course with ours.
Lieutenant Commander Nicholson of the
Oregon was then called and began his recital
of the .story of the battle of July 3, which he
had observed as navigator of the Oregon. He
was, he said, on the deck of his vessel, and
added:
Nicholson Called to Testify.
"Under the circumstances may you have not
failed to hear all that Captain Sigsbee said?"
"After hearing the conversation which I have
given. Captain Sigsbee and the commodore
walked aft. so I could not hear what was said,
and I went below."
Captain Lemly asked: "May not Captain
Sigsbee have said: 'I have been here about a
week and have not seen anything of them,' or
\u25a0words to that effect, meaning the Spanish
flett?" â¢
"No. sir. As I remember it he said 'They
could not be here unless I knew it.' "
"To whom were these remarks addressed
solely? Were they addressed to you at all?"
"No sir."
While Ensign Marble was on the stand for
the purpose of correcting his former testimony
he was further interrogated by Judge Advocate
Lemly concerning the conversation between
Captain Sigsbee of the St. Paul and Commo
dore Schley, overheard by him (the witness)
when Captain Sigsbee came aboard the Brook
lyn off Santiago, May 20.
The list of witnesses called for to-day in
cluded Lieutenant Commander Reginald F.
ICicholson, who was navigator of the Oregon
during the campaign of 1S98; Dr. Charles M.
Devalin, passed assistant surgeon; Captain J.
L. Hannam, retired, who was chief engineer on
the Brooklyn during the war with Spain; Lieu
tenant T. F. Carter, Ensign W. P. Cronin, Car
penter J. H. Warford. all of whom were on
the Brooklyn; Mr. Hunlc-y, who was chief
machinist on the Teias, and Lieutenant B. W.
Wells Jr.. who was Admiral Schley's flag lieu
tenant. It is expected that Captain Clark of
the Oregon will be among the witnesses to be
heard early next week.
\u25a0WASHINGTON. Oct. 18.â The list of yester
day's witnesses called before the Schley court
of inquiry at the beginning of to-day's session
for the purpose of correcting testimony was
exceptionally long, comprising eight persons.
There were, however, not many hew questions
asked of any of them, and, as the testimony
was comparatively brief in each case, the time
consumed in hearing them was not great.

SCHLEY'S GAIXA2TT CONDUCT.!
FRENCH DEFEAT
IN WEST AFRICA
-With reference to the McCall memorandum,
saying- that a good landing place could be
found on the- coast of Cuba thirteen miles to
the westward of Cienfuegos, it was shown that
it .had been received at 8:15 p. m. on May 25,
and the witness said that as the Hawk had ar
rived at that time he thought the memoran
dum had not been received until then. No. 8. a
dispatch from Admiral Samusoh, sayine that
the Spanish squadron probably was at San
tiago arid directing Admiral Schley to proceed
there with all dispatch if satisfied that the
Spaniards were not at Cienfugos, also was re
ferred to, and It was shown that according to
the receiving stamp imprint it had been re
ceived at 8:15 p. m., May 23, and that another
copy had been received on the following day.
While the McCalla memorandum was under
discussion. Lieutenant Wells stated that there
was but one copy of it received, and then Ray
nor asked him.
"Do you recollect any 'other copy of this
-memorandum or.McCalla's being sent to Com
modore Schley, or through you to Commodore
Schley, except this one memorandum that I
now show you?", ......
. "I .only recollect, receiving this one," re
plied the witness. ,' ;
\u25a0'â¢Lieutenant Wells said he did not know what
had become of ' Commodore .Schley's papers.
He said they.were all boxed up- when he left
the Brooklj'n and' turned- over to him. - . -;
Mr. Raynor. also questioned- the witness con
cerning the visits of. Admiral (then captain)
Cotton to the Brooklyn on May. 27 and 30. ; Ad
miral Cotton, was then in" command of thu
Harvard and the dispatch which he had taken
aboard ' the. flagship was presented and read.
This dispatch was from Admiral Sampson and
was 'directed to Captain Cotton. Another dis
patch which was presented while Admiral Cot
ton was on the stand was read by Raynor.
It likewise was from Sampson to Cotton and
was as follows: r . \u25a0 ..
' "The Spanish squadron at Santiago. If pre-r
vlous to May 19 scout off Santiago. Commu
nicate with Schley if they moved -west. Schley
is expected May 24 at Santiago from Cierf

letter for Schlsy, then go'otf "Santiago" to' meet
him," etc \u25a0\u25a0-.\u25a0-\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0
The witness said in response to questions by
Raynor that he did not remember the- receipt
of this \u25a0 last â¢ dispatch on. board the Brooklyn,
p.nd Raynor said that while the dispatch had
been introduced when Admiral Cotton was on
the stand, he had asked for the original "of it,
but had failed to receive it. He remarked at
the same time that he had doubts that the
original would be supplied and that the re
quest merely had been overlooked by the rep
resentatives of the Navy Department.
Captain Lemly assured him that the original
would be produced. :. . ;'â¢â¢â¢;

"I saw during this ' action a number of ' dis
charges of . smokeless powder from the slope
to the westward â¢ of . the entrance. Several
shells passed over us . and dropped near us.
The commodore at, that time made a number
of Joking remarks about some of us dodging.
I don't think he dodged. Hei seemed to m>Â» at
that time to be - wholly self-possessed and
without any perturbation." 1 .
"Was he laboring under any mental excite
ment at that time?" .. . #
"None at all, that I could see. He was in
a very natural frame of mind."
Mr. . Raynor. questioned the witness a: con
siderable length concerning the receipt of dis
patches while the flying squadron lay off Cien
fuegos and alao after it had arrived at San
tiago. . He first directed the witness' attention
to dispatch No. 7, known as the "Dear Schley"
letter, and elicited from him the statement,
based upon notes upon the oack of copies of
the", dispatch presented to him for identifica
tion,- that two copies had -toeen" received, the"

had heard orders given to the New Orleans to

Objects to Criticism.
Lieutenant Wells' Story. '
Lieutenant B. W. Wells Jr.. who was Com
modore- Schley's flag lieutenant during the
Cuban campaign, was called. Lieutenant
A\ ells gave a detailed account of the entire
campaign, beginning with the dsparture from
Hamilton Roads, the stay at Cienfuegoa, the
cruise to Santiago, the retrograde movement,
the blockade of Santiago, the bombardment of
the Colon antl the battle of Santiago. DMCdb-"
ing the blockade of Cienfuegos, . the witness
spoke especially of the appearance there of the
British steamer Adula on May 23. which he
said, brought a war bulletin from Kingston,
containing . the information that the Spanish
squadron had gone into the harbor at KantU
ago but had subsequently left. He remembered
the meeting with the scout-boats St. ; Paul.
\ale and Minneapolis on the evening of \u25a0 the
26th and also the visit at that time made to
the flagship by Captain Sigsbee and the signal
to return to Key West, via the Yucatan
Channel. ' \u25a0 '
On the 2fth the weather having abated, the
commodore signaled to ask if the Texas rculrl
coal, to which the reply was:' "Can try."
The Texas and other vessels having coaled,"
th; fleet headed to the eastward, arriving oil
Santiago about sunset. The next morning the
squadron had steamed In more : closely anj he
had seen two of the Spanish ships.
Coming to the bombardment of the- Colon
on May 31. the witness undertook to quote
from memory a publication by the Navy De
partment which had, he said, aiven him the
impression that the land batteries there were,
manned by large guns. Captain Lemly obÂ«
Jected, saying the publication itself should be
produced. Some controversy between counsel
ensued, arid Raynor spoke of the objection
as a mere frivolity.- To this Captain Lemly
responded:
oft We attempted first to drop his body over
board on account of the blood on the deck,
but the commodore said to carry him aft, not
to throw him overboard, and that he should
be buried on land."
i ," D l d , you see Commodore Schley about that
time? _
"All the time.".
"What was his manner and bearing, as they
Impressed you?"
"Admirable, I thought."
"Was his position â¢ one of danger?"
His position was on a little bridge ruilt
around the^ conning tower and he was on the
fighting side of the ship all. the- time as- far
as I could see." \u25a0 '

CASTRO'S FOES
AGAIN AT WORK
Captain Kannum Heard.
Dr. Devalin was then excused, and: Captain
John L. Ilannurn was called. He was the chief
engineer on board the . Brooklyn and " of the
flying squadron during the Cuban campaign.
Captain Hannum's testimony, aside from re
plies to questions by the court, related entirely
to the condition of the', collier Herrimac on
May 27 and 28. He saW that on the forenoon
of the former, date Commodore Schley had or
dered him to go aboard the collier; that having
done so he found her Intermediate valve gear
entirely disabled. He also said that while the
Merrimac was not entirely helpless her horse
power was reduced one-third and that she was
able to hobble along only at the rate of four
or five knots an hour. -
The court asked Captain Hannum the fol
lowing questions: \u25a0 . .
"What was the Brooklyn's most economical
speed and how much coal. per day did she burn
at that speed while you were her chief en
gineer?"
"Her economical speed, I think, was about
ten knots, burning from seventy to -seventy-five
tens of ccal a day." ...
"Were the fires laid ready for. lighting under
an boilers not in use. by the Brooklyn? if not
why not?" ' - ' .'â¢--\u25a0:.
"I think the furnaces were coaled I am
pretty sure they were ready to throw a shovel
ful of coal on them and start them." â¢ \u25a0
Captain Hannum was then excused and Lieu
tenant Thomas F. Carter, passed assistant en
gineer, who was in charge of the machinery
or the main engines of the Brooklyn during
the Santiago campaign, was called. In reply
to a request from Raynor he gave a statement
concerning the condition 'of the engines of the
Brooklyn on the morning of the battle of Jiily
3. raying:
"The after main engines were not used. The
*"I may have so stated, but I do not now
remember and cannot " repeat any conversa
tion of the kind."
"Have you not heretofore repeated it?" .
At this point Raynor interrupted Captain
Lemly's examination with a protest against
the putting of his question without giving the
names of persons with whom witness was sup
posed to have had the conversation in ques
tion, but Captain Lemly objected to this in
terruption and insisted upon the regularity of
the proceedings. . . : â¢ . \u25a0 - .-\u25a0â¢-.
Speaking for the court Admiral Dewey sus
tained Raynor's point, saying: "We know
more law now than we did berore. Time, place
and names of individuals should be given. I
would not like- myself to have such a- question
put to me; no one would like it." \u25a0
Captain Lemly then asked: "Did you tell
Lieutenant Ward in Portsmouth, N. H., on
August C that you had heard a conversation
in which the word 'Texas' was used?" .
The witness said he had no recollection of
saying anything at that time about the Texas.
Dr. Charles M. Devalin followed Commander
Nicholson. He said that he had been medical
officer on board the Brooklyn and -had observed
the battle of July 3 from the forecastle. He
gave a brief description of the battle, saying
he had been present when Yeoman - Ellis was
killed and that he had observed Commodore
Schley during the entire engagement.
"His conduct and bearing," said the witness,
"were all that could be expected. He seemed
to know what he was about and to be doing
all that he wished to do. He was in perfeat
control of the situation."
In response to questions from Captai-n Lemly
the witness said that he had heard Commodore
Schley give tha order "Helm hard aport." and
had heard no one else give it. In response to
a question he said he had at that time heard,
no colloquy or altercation concerning this or
dar. ' ' .â¢;:â¢â¢ .(
"Haven't -ou stated, heretofore, that you did.
hear such a conversation?"

"When the Oregon changed her direction to
ward the Brooklyn had the Brooklyn completed
her turn?"
"I am under the impression that she had;
she must have done so."
"What was the position of the Oregon when
Fhe turned with Ftarboard helm during the
battle off Santiago?"
"She was lving still In the water, and we
turned to head off the Spanish fleet. We over
took all but the Colon very quickly."
"The Iowa was due south; .the Texas'on.her
port hand and the Brooklyn farther off to the
westward. The Oregon was to the right of the
Iowa and the Indiana inshore to the eastward,'
with the New York in the distance. I remem
ber looking for the flagship, and saw her off
seven or eight -miles tpward Siboney." -... . .'
"Did the Oregon at any time pa^s. between,
the Brooklyn.' and the Spanish ships?"/' "!.'..
"Not when they were offering any; ;actlve.*re
sistance; she did as the Spanish vessels turned
to po ashore." - - - â¢ : - -j .

position when the Spanish ships started out?";
â¢ "Practically, yes." â¢ '.>'
! "What was her course with reference to' the
Morro?" '> t \u25a0 â¢ . .
' "About four miles distant and a little east
ward to south of it." / . . \u25a0 /
â¢ "What was the distance between the block
ading:-positions of the Oregon and Brooklyn?"
i "From three to ' four miles in the daytime;
they were nearer together at night." .'
"What was the relative position of the Amer
ican ships when the Spanish vessels came out?"
j In reply to Hanna the witness said he had
observed the Spanish fleet as it came out of
the harbor at Santiago they were in column
and in order, three or four ships' lengths apart;
that all ported their helms and turned to the
westward, apparently with the intention of go-
Ing ashore if necessary. During the early part
of the engagement he had seen none of the
iSpanish vessels turning . toward any of the
American ships and he was sure there- was
no well developed movement. in' that direction.
Yet the smoke was dense and- he could not
be certain of all details.
i The court asked questions ' of Commander
Nicholson as follows: â¢ \u25a0' \^ " â¢ .-
In response to another question by Captain
Lemly Commander Nicholson said: "!\u25a0 thought
the Oregon was nearer the enemy during the
chase than the Brooklyn, but the distance
varied somewhat. At one time ths Brooklyn
had apparently turned to head oft a turn of
the Colon toward' Cane Cruz. 'A .
In reply to questions by Raynor the witness
said he could nut say positively that he had
Been the Brooklyn make her turn, but that he
had seen her chanee her position. He had
never peen the Brooklyn and the Texas when
they were closer together than a" mile or a
mile and a half. He also said that he did
not remember any signal from the Brooklyn
to the Oregon to use her 13-inch guns on the
Colon.
"Did the Oregon use her 13-inch guns early
in the action?" Captain Lemly asked, as his
first question on cross-examination.
"Oh, yes," was the response. "But she
stopped using them during the chase of the
Colon as that vessel was so lar away that to
use them \u25a0 would have been a waste of am
munition."

nals from the Brooklyn on the day of the
battle, among others one at the beginning of
the battle to close up and another at the close
of the engagement saying: "Well done,

"As for the first signal," he said,- "we -were
already closing in and it did not influence us."

Captain Lemly replied that he did not relish'
such 'conduct- with "imputations- on one hand
and apologies on the other." \u25a0
Raynor responded that he was sorry he
(Lemly) had been so badly hurt. ' '\u25a0 .
' Hunly- was then'excused and "Lieutenant J
P. J. Ryan, who was assistant engineer on the
Brooklyn, was called. Describing the battle
off Santiago, the witness said:
"I passed ranges from. -Yeoman. -Ellis into
the forward turret until Ellis was killed
These ranges varied. The last range I made
a mistake in passing. I thought he said 700
when he said 1100 yards." .
"Were you present when. Ellis was killed?"
"Yes. sir. I was standing alongside of him
A shell from what I thought was the Colon
struck him in the face and took his head
"I don't know; I was ordered to come."
Captain Lemly asked Raynor to state the
purpose of the question. He went on to say
that this was an imputation which he resented
Replying Raynor. said lie had meant no im
putation; that Admiral Schley had not had
the witness summoned and' that he (the ad
miral) had accidentally \ found the witness
here. .
"Nothing at all. I don't remember stopping
or backing. The only orders I remember were
to 'slow. down' and for. 'full speed.' "
"Do you know of anything that was dbne
on the starboard side?" . â¢ â¢
"I do not."
Raynorâ Who summoned . you here?
An Imputation Resented.
"Is there anything to fix the signals given
In your mind?"
"No, sir," the witness replied.
"Was the port engine of the Texas either
stopped or backed?"
"No, sir." .
"Was it slowed down?"
"Slowed down; yes, sir." ' !
Hanna cross-examined Hunly who said that
he had .been on duty all the time during the
battle.
J. L,. Hunly. who was chief machinist on the
Texas during the battle of July 3.' was called.
He said that during the engagement he had
been on duty at the throttle of the port en
gine. He said. in response to a question by
Raynor that he knew Alfred Claxton 'â¢ who
had previously testified that on the day of
the battle he was standing at I the throttle of
the port engine. â¢
"Is that correct?" asked Raynor, quoting
Claxton's testimony.
Warford said that Commodore Schley's con
duct and bearing during the battle were \u25a0 that
of a fearless officer. He said that during the
engagement the turning tank of the Brooklyn
filled with water.
When Cronan was excused. George H. War
ford, who was carpenter on the Brooklyn, was
called. Describing the battie of July 3, he
said that early, in the action the order was
passed by a marine orderly, "Stand ready to
ram." He also said that later and during the
chase he had seen the "Vlscaya turn as if to
ram ! the Brooklyn, . before the former -went
ashore. He said he had made a personal ex
amination of the Brooklyn after the battle
and found that she had- been struck thirty
times.
"Stand Ready to Earn."
In reply to a question by the court, Cronan
said that so far as he knew neither the Eagle
nor the Vixen had made any signal requesting
the squadron to slow down on the cruise from
Cienfuegos to Santiago.
Cronan continued his testimony at the opening
of the afternoon session. He related the details
of the battle of July 3 and described the turn
of the Brooklyn. He observed, he said, that the
first ship appeared to be heading toward the
Brooklyn, creating the impression that either
she meant to ram the Brooklyn or the Brook
lyn to ram her. This contingency, however, was
avoided by both the Brooklyn and the Spanish
ships putting the helm to port. /
"Yes, sir. That morning I was on watch on
the after bridge of the Brooklyn. We sighted
the-* three ships bound for Key West, one of
which was a converted yacht. -The Scorpion left
the column and went over toward the yacht and
communicated with her. The Scorpion came
..back and communicated a megaphone message
to . the Brooklyn. The substance of this mes
sage was that the Nashville was returning to
\u25a0Key 'West broken down; that the Cincinnati and
Aesuvtus were patrolling Yucatan channel, and
that Captain McCalla reported he had' seen
nptning of the Spaniards at Cienfuegos."
i "Who received that message?" asked Raynor.
'-."To the"besÂ£of my remembrance the commo
dore and flag lieutenant were on'the brldga'be
sides myself." -. .
\u25a0 Relating' his experiences during "the voyage
from Cienfuescs to Santiago, he said:
"It was the roughest weather we had had
since I had been on the Brooklyn. The ship
had more motion than I have seen her have.
It ..was a short, heavy head sea."
The witness placed the dis.tance'of the-block
ading line at Santiago at from three and a half
to five miles from shore, saying that he had
been watch officer and had made close obser
vations. â¢ There were picket boats on the inside
of the line.
Lieutenant Carter+v/as then excused and W.
P. Cronan, v art ensign; who : served as signal offi
cer t; on . the >., Brooklyn during the Cuban cam
paign, was called.*; Raynor asked him whether
he .-remembered ai'.incssaEe from the Scorpion
to- the Brooklyn -on May. 19 as he was going
from Key West to Cienfuegos. The witness re
plied: â¢\u25a0' - ' â¢
Ensign Tells of Messages.
"The two after boilers had no water in them.
Those .fires were not laid until after the battle
call was sounded, .but the other boilers not in
use did -have fires laid. As to when they were

water in them had',tKeir furnaces' charged and
those without water were kept uncharged."
. "When were the fires laid "in the boilers that
were not in use when. the battle began on the
morninsr of July-3?'-' t
"Were the engines at any time stopped, re
versed or slowed?"
"The engines., were not at any time during the
battle stopped or reversed. I. have no recollec-'
tion of their ever having been slowed. They
certainly were not stopped nor reversed."
At ,Raynor's request. the witness presented a
written memorandum, which he had prepared,
showing the speed of the Brooklyn during the
day of battie, arid indicating a gradual increase
from llij to 14 knots per- hour..' ; The memoran
dum was based on the basis of the revolutions
of the propeller. In response. to questions by
Captain Lemly, the witness stated that he es
timated the entire distance traversed between
9:35 a. m. and 1:15 p. m. at 52.5 knots..'

ing messages- during the battle, tha .witness re
plied that he had; and that. some of the mes
sages' were from': Commodore'' Schley, others
from Â£a:uain Cook and .still others from As
sistant'Engineer Ryan. . .
The court .then asked the following question:
Engines Not Keyersed.
"Every effort was made to economize steam
and get the most power out or it, the most turns
of the engine. There was a steady increase in
the number of the turns of the engines from
the beginning to the end." \u25a0

At this' point Raynor stated to the court that
he desired, to interrogate Wells with "reference
to the battle of July 3. but that, as the hour of
adjournment was approaching,, he "would not
have time to conclude his examination of the
witness upon this branch of the inquiry. He
therefore asked to be allowed to postpone fur
ther questioning until the next session of the
court. He also requested an adjournment of
the court until next Monday. Both requests
were granted and the court adjourned until 11
o'clock Monday next. -

"Have you any recollection how far off shore
the squadron was when these signals were
made, from your own observation?"
"Well, the squadron's general distance was
off shore about three, or four miles, and we
stood to 'the southward , about' eight miles, I
should say. We were twelve or fifteen miles
off shore." - - ' '.' -
"When did you first distinctly find out where
the Spanish squadron was?" ..
"When we saw the Colon at the entrance to
the harbor of Santiago on the morning of the
29th of May."
"Do you know, from your own knowledge,
about the difficulty of coaling the Texas on
May 27 p.nd 2S?" V;
"I recollect that there was a -signal, which
was 'the subject of some, conversation, relative
to the fact that the collier and Texas had both
suffered from injury' at that time and, later, a
day or so, I remember seeing on the ship's side
evidences of some repairs being made; in the
nature of red lead and touching up."
"Do you know Whether any report was made
to Commodore Schley at the time of the recon
noissance of the fact that the ship was not on
the range that had been determined on? What
was the range determined on?"
"Seven thousand yards or 7500 yards. When
first we closed in, my recollection is that Mr.
Potts reported to Captain Hlgginson that the
ship was about that range.''

Every Sufferer .fiom; Catirrh Knows that
Salves, Lotions, Washes, i prays and
â¢ Touches Dj-Not Cure. s
Powders, lotions, salves, sprays and In-
halers cannot really cure Catarrh, because
this disease is a blood disease, and local
applications, If they accomplish anything
at all, simply give transient relief. .
The catarrhal poison is In the blood and
the mucous membrane. of the. -nose, threat
and trachea tries to relieve the system by
secreting. large, quantities-, o.f. mucus, .the
discharge - sometimes closing up the.. nos-
trils, dropping -into the .throat, - causing
deafness, by closing the Eustachian tubes,
and after a time causing catarrh of stom-
ach or serious, throat and lung troubles.
' A remedy to'really cure catarrh must be
an internal remedy which will cleanse the
blood from catarrhal poison and remove
the fever and congestion from the mucdu3
membrane. .; \u25a0 .- â¢'.' :
The best and. most modern- remedies for
this, purpose are antiseptics scientifically
known as Eucalyptol, Guaiacol, San-
guinaria and Hydrastin,, and while each
of .these has been successfully used sep-
arately, yet -it has been difficult to get
them all combined in one palatable, con-
venient and efficient form. . v
The manufacturers of the new catarrh
cure. Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, have suc-
ceeded admirably in accomplishing this
result. ' They are large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, to be dissolved in the mouth,
thus reaching every part of the mucous
membrane of the throat and " finally the
stomach, r . : â¢ \u25a0 < . â¢ .
. Unlike many catarrh remedies, Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets contain no cocaine, opiate
or any injurious drug whatever' and are
equally beneficial for little children and
adults.- \u25a0 '-' ., \u25a0 \
Mr. C. R. Rembrandt of Rochester, N.
Y., says: "I know of few people who have
suffered as much as I from Catarrh of
the head, throat and stomach. 1 used
sprays, inhalers and powders for months
at a time with only slight relief, and had
no hope of cure. I had not the means to
make a change of climate, which seemed
my only chance of cure. \u25a0 .
"Last spring I read an account of some
remarkable cures made by Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and promptly bought a
fifty-cent box from my druggist- and ob-
tained such positive benefit from that one
package that I continued to use them
daily until I now consider myself entirely
free from the 'disgusting annoyance of ca-
tarrh; my head Is clear, my digestion all I
could ask and my hearing, which had be-
gun to fail as a result of the catarrh, has
greatly improved until I feel I can hear a3
well as ever. They are a household neces-
sity in my family." .
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by
druggists at 50 cents for complete treat-
ment, i and for convenience, safety and
prompt results they are undoubtedly the
long-looked-for catarrh cure. . .

The progress in Samar is satisfactory in some
ways and not in others. The subduing of the
fighting propensities of the war faction Is re
duced almost to a nullity. The growth of our
strength in the estimation of the people is also
quite satisfactory. The fact is. their love for
the flesh pots, and incidentally for the Ameri
cans who represent said pots, is growing bur
densome, as the securing of the hemp with
which to pay for rice is becoming a heavy busi
ness. In nearly all 'our posts where the com
mander has exercised good Judgment, colonies
of natives have come In and settled and con
cluded they would set up their lares and pen

strength, but in this vicinity, or b*tween the

thousand have come in. In the interior Blanca

WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.â Henry E.
Cooper, Territorial Secretary and for sev
eral months prior to his departure for the
United States acting Governor of Hawaii,
has discussed with Secretary of Agricul
ture Wilson the conditions in the Terri
tory. One of the main aims of Cooper's
trip here is to acquaint the administra
tion with the actual situation in Hawaii.
In his conference with Secretary Wilson
he emphasized the seriousness of the la
bor problem. The natives are dying off
rapidly, the mortality being In the neigh
borhood of forty deaths to the thousand,
and foreign laborers are getting out of the
country much .more rapidly than they are
coming in. The encouragement of Chi
nese labor, said he, is regarded as the
most promising solution, and the Territo
rial government is anxious that large
numbers of laborers shall come in from
China. The sugar cane crop that should
have been harvested at the beginning of
juiy 'he saia, is not >et oif. me iieid and
win not be harvested before next month.
The natives generally will not work. Tne
coftee industry is languishing, and many
things that snould be raised there have
to be bought outside the islands. Secre
tary Wilson informed Cooper of a report
from the superintendent of the agricul
tural station in .Honolulu showing, among
other things, that it costs $26 an acre to
fertilize the cane crop in Hawaii, and
pointed out the big farm wage which has
to be paid to farm laborers, viz., $40 a
month, including board, which Is, approx
imately, $10 more than in this country.
Cooper suggested that the average farm
wage might be even greater. '\u25a0. \u25a0
Secretary Wilson told Cooper- of the
plans the department was making for
Hawaii and said that he intended to build
up the coffee, spice and rubber and other
industries and to help to diversify the Ha
waiian Industries. No attention will be
paid to the sugar industry there, as Wil
son contends that that already Is devel
oped to the limit.- The department pur
poses, said Wilson, to make all these isl
ands within the United States raise what
ever is adaptable to them Individually and
to furnish everything that is needed
among, themselves. T â¢ ,
Cooper called at the Interior Department
to-day and finally revised his annual re
port which he has submitted to Secretary
Hitchcock. He says all experiments have
shown that the Americans are not fluted
for labor in the islands, and that there is
nothing to do but to get' foreign labor.'
Cooper says this in nowise will affect the
labor conditions in the United States, as
the entrance of foreign labor already is
sufficiently guarded here. He
points out that' $20,000,000 worth of ma
chinery and similar supplies had to be
bought from the United States for use In
Hawaii " during the last year, I and said
that improved conditions there would ad
vance commercial conditions \u25a0 here. â¢ He
will leave for Hawaii next Thursday. â¢
Officer Saves Him From Suicide.
7VALLEJO, Oct. 18.â Charles Lehan, a
sailor on the French collier Marguerite
Mollneux, tried to hang himself In the
City Prison to-day, but was J discovered
by Officer Scully, who cut him down be
fore life was. extinct. The man had writ
ten two letters, one to his father In
France and the other to the French Con
buI in San Francisco. It was on com
plaint of the captain of the. vessel that
the sailor was arrested and he was in the
City Prison awaiting trial.
Tip to 2500 men, but additional men cannot
be spared from Luzon because of the dan
ger of an outbreak on that island. In his
annual report Adjutant General Corbln
says that the force in the Philippines will
be reduced by r.ext June by 20,457 men in
consequence of the expiration of their
terms of enlistment. Troops will be sent
to the Philippines to replace these men,
and it is prooable that reinforcements
â¢will be dispatched in order that action
can be taken which will stamp out the
la ft vestige of the insurrection in all the
islands.
The following brief cablegram from
General Chaffee reporting the fight of the
Ninth Infantry in Snmar on Wednesday
was received at the War Department this
afternoon:
MANILA, Oct. IS.â Corbin, Adjutant General.
N'egros and Panay continue In tranquillity.
It ia my intention to leave one battalion of the
Sixth Infantry and the native battalion in Ne
gros; in Panay six companies of the Sixth In
fantry, four troops of the Tenth Cavalry and
th? <?. ,h TÂ° n f S Â°. r na r tlve *- Tw Â° companies of
the Sixth Infantry I expect to bring, tempo
rarily, at least, to the west coast of Cebu.
Our cause is growin? stronger with the peo
ple in Cebu, and while the outlaws there will
have to be roughly dealt with there is no doubt
that we will find much assistance from the na
tives themselves in doing so. I hope to be able
to go over there in personNby the 1st of Sep
tember and try to push matters.
In Leyte the last, surrender was that of the

The people of Bohol seem to be gradually
coming to the opinion that they made r a mis
take and are showing symptoms of a change of
front.
quite easy if all officers of the organizations
were present, but it Is fully appreciated that
some of the detachments are commanded by
officers who hai'e really never been snot over.
Just at this date the bulk of the rifles seem
to be in the region Just west of the" Calublgr
River. There are now five detachments in there
making it uncomfortable for the people; one on
the Pambujan, one ; on the Mondragon, two
moving east from the Upper Calarman and one
moving north from Taviran and San Enrique.
The Pambujan Mountain is the objective,
speaking generally, of all these detachments.
FIske Warren, the first man to take the
oath of allegiance required under the re
cent act of the Philippine <Sommission of
all suspects wishing to land, has been
closely identified with Sixto Lopez. Many
treasonable and inflammatory proclama
tions were found in his baggage. Regard
ing this he said he held only one copy of
each, having retained these as souvenirs.
It is known also that he was intimate
with the members of the junta in Hong
kong. He at first objected to taking the
oath, saying that he was a loyal citizen,
but he signed it when notified that on no
other condition would he be allowed to
land.
Some of his fellow passengers told Civil
Governor Taft that Warren and Lopez
shook hands and retired for consultation
upon hearing of President McKinley's aa
sasination. ' :
Governor Taft considers the action of
the commission in requiring all suspects
to swear allegiance perfectly justified.
MANILA, Oct. 18.â Five hundred bolo
men attacked a detachment of forty-six
men of the Ninth Infantry at Bangajon,
on the Candara River, island of Samar,
Wednesday, killing ten and wounding six.
The remainder of the company arrived on
the scene in time to prevent further
slaughter and routed the enemy, kiHing
over 100 of them. It is believed that the

SPOKANE, Oct. 18.â Miss Mary Knud
son of Moscow. Idaho, says that she ar
rayed herself in bridal robes and waited
in vain for the Rev. John W. Spencer to
coma and marry her. Her parents had
prepared a wedding supper, but their la
bor was in vain/ Spencer's father is said
to have come between the loving hearts.
To-day Miss Knudson filed a suit for $10,
100 for breach of promise. The $10,000 is
for alleged injury to feelings and the J100
for the bridal ccstume and the supper.
.Miss Knudson is the daughter of a well
known farmer. The Rev. Mr. Spencer Is
an itinerant preacher and the son of a
wealthy farmer. Mi?s Knudson says they

day Judges would be elected who would
not "turn the women down."
Mrs. E. L. Smith of San Jose urged the
formation of a I Â»nd of 100 or 200 women
taxpayers to w rk in the tax-protest
movement. If su ha league, backed by a
few millions of capital, were to begin op
erations the demands of women would be
respected.
The matter of the formation of a league
was discussed. One delegate wanted to
know in what way capital could be effec
tive in forwarding the suffrage movement
in the courts. Mrs. Smith answered that
capital is a power even In the courts. All
men. even Judges, respect wealth and if
the interest of wealthy women Is enlisted
in the movement the woman suffrage as
pect will change materially.
One of the most thoughtful addresses of
the afternoon was delivered by Mrs. B.
Fay Mills on the subject of the new wom
an. The age demanded new women as
well as new men, she said. Tne Idea that
the new woman must necessarily sacri
fice her domesticity and womanhood by
taking up the higher thought seemed re
pugnant to the speaker. The argument
that women who pay taxes should not
vote while that privilege is granted to
male inmates of the almshouses all over
the land was ridiculous. There Is too
much nonsensical talk about the equality
of the sexes. You might as well talk aoout
: the equality of a circle and a triangle.
The only equality is in the association of
, the sexes in a common aim.
PRINCIPAL. SPEAKER AT THE
OPENING SESSION OF WOM
AN SUFFRAGE CONVENTION.
Mrs. Lucy W. McMann, an attorney of
San Jose, in 'discussing the general ques
tion of woman's said It was nec
essary for women to study the . iaws of
their State as relating to the rights and
privileges of â¢ their sex. It too often hap
pened that women demanded the enact
ment of laws which were already on the
statute books. There was no use cutting
a pathway through a dense chaparral to
the Temple of Justice standing on the hill
when on the other side is a wide road
way already in existence. Continuing she
said:
We'll reach the temple some day, but we
won't do so unless we know more of the laws
governing our sex. The laws of this State are
fairer to women than they are to men. For
instance a woman may place a homestead upon
her husband's personal property, but the man
cannot in any way incumber his wife's personal
property. . Class legislation is unconstitutional
and if we want to win our flgrht we must take
the matter into the highest court of the land.
"We took It there once," said a dele
gate, "and the court 'turned us down.* "
Mrs. McCann replied that the judiciary
of the land was elective and that some
The afternoon session of the convention
was opened with the reading of a paper
by Dr. Alida C. Avery of San Jose. She
referred to the assassination of President
McKinley by an anarchist and said the
national cry of "Down with anarchy"
made the establishment of schools where
the right of- franchise may be truly
taught imperative. If women had the
right of suffrage much of the crime aris
ing from the misuse of the franchise
would be impossible. It was a shame, she
concluded, that women who bore their
shares of the expenses of government
should be denied the right to declare by
their, vote bow that government should
be conducted.
Mrs. A. L.. Corbert of Palo Alto followed
with an address, In which she recounted
her personal experience in woman's suf
frage clubs. She found that it was essen
tial to think of things which would give
women something to do.
Reference was made by the speaker to
the tax protest movement as growing
everywhere, and she suggested that- some
action be taken to make it a State move
ment. ,
Suffrage Would Check Crime.
The following were appointed as a com
mittee on resolutions: Mrs. William
Keith, Berkeley; Mrs. J. J. Scoville, San
Francisco: Mrs. McCowan, Ukiah, and
Mrs. L.. W. Taylor, Santa Clara,
A paper on the subject of taxation with
out representation was read by Mrs. Bes
sie Blodgett of Massachusetts. Mrs. Em
ma Shatter Howard spoke on coeducation.
Dr. Minora Ribbe reported that there
are five clubs in this city with a member
ship of HI. State Treasurer Mrs. Schling
heyde reported $101 21 In the treasury.
That part of Judge Sloss' opinion which
seemed to place women in the same cate
gory with idiots, lunatics and children
represented by guardians was vigorously
criticized by Mrs. William Keith of
Berkeley. Her remarks were warmly ap
plauded. \u25a0 "â¢
of officers the decision of Superior Judge
Sloss on the application of Mrs. A. A. Sar
gent to be placed on the register of vot
ers was read and discussed. Mrs. Sar
gent's suit was brought on the ground
that being a taxpayer she was In^ justice
privileged to cast her vote as a 'citizen.
Her prayer being denied by the court,
Mrs. Sargent said that the courts were in
the habit of construing the law as it suit
ed their convenience.

On August 12 George Barnes, aged 61
years, obtained a licvnse here to marry
Elizabeth Barnes, aged 4S years. Both
were residents of Pulo Alto. According
to the certificate filed here a few days
ago the couple were married in San Fran
cisco on October 8 by the Rev. A. H.
miggs of the Central Methodist Episco
pal Church. C. 0. Burton and Everett
R. Brent were witnesses. When the cer-
Ulicate was sent here to Recorder Owen
he noticed the marriage had taken place
outside of the county. He at once wrote
to Barnes at Falo Alto informing him
that in his opinion the marriage was. not
valid. To-day Recorder Owen received a
reply from Barnes, who stated the min
ister told him the license was good any
where in the State. He asked to have
the certificate sent him. as he wanted to
go to San Francisco and ascertain wheth
er he was. really married or not.
SAN JOSE, Oct. IS.â Through a misun
derstanding of the law Mr. and Mrs.
George Barnes of Palo Alto have been

Probably the cleverest \ sketch of the
personal traits ' of J. Pierpont Morgan as
he has appeared in his- present visit to
the West has been written for this week's
News I^etter' by Morrison Pixley. The
featured editorial of this week is a some
what sensational expose of the real ex
tent of gambling as it is carried on ..in
San Francisco. This article is entitled
"How San Francisco's Tiger Is Fed," and
is well worth reading. The Town Crier
has : trumped- up a lampoon municipal
ticket which he has labeled "The Anarch
ists' Ticket" and filled with some very in
congruous candidates. The columns of
Lady Algy, Mrs. Chauncey de Wit and
the Looker .On are, as usual, splendid de
partments, and the editorial, and .critical
discussion is scholarly and timely. " â¢, .

"On July 15 Bruner called on me at the
noon recess while the case was being tried
and told me that unless I made an affi
davit that Koyes was not corrupt Blake
would have the case go against me. After
refusing for some time I sat down and
wrote out the affidavit. It was made out
at 1:30 p. m. July 15. At 2 o'clock the de
murrer was overruled. That affidavit was
true,' 1 for outside of McKenzie I did not
know that corruption existed on the part
of Judge Noyes."
Other cases were then cited by Hume
in which he was interested and which re
ceived an eccentric judicial cognizance
from Judge Noyes. Continuing this line,
he said: ,.
"In Park vs. Overman I was attorney
for Mr. Park in regard to a piece of prop
erty known as the City Bakery. I was
notified that if I should withdraw the case
might be won and unless M. J. Corcoran
was employed we would lose. The case
was tried soon after and Park got the
decision. In Burgstrom vs. Plow the ver
dict of the jury was against me. I made
a motion for a new trial, but it was de
nied. Then, to my surprise. Joseph K.
Wood went before Judge Noyes and was
successful, though my client gave me no
warning that another attorney was called
in and I objected to it as soon as I dis
covered the facts."
Other cases were cited In which Hume
retired. Woods being substituted with
good results.
"What action was taken by the court"
said PHlsbury. The witness thought the
cases were then settled.
"I will say that Woods was in consul
tation with the Judge about this time,"
concluded Hume. The hearing- was then
Continued, to be resumed to-day at 10
o'clock.
"In the fall of 1900 I began an action,
Blake vs. Haglin, involving a grub stake
contract. When the suit was brought Mc-
Kenzle demanded that all of. our interests
in this litigation should be turned over to
him or we would get no receiver appoint
ed and that we could get no hearing be
fore Judge Noyes. I was informed at the
close of navigation that if I did not re
tire from the matter the case would never
be heard. I did this and Bruner was sub
stituted.
"Will you state the circumstances under
which you made the affidavit of July 15."
"How long were you with Noyes when
he .signed those orders," said the amicus
curiae.
"I. could not have been in the room
more than twenty to thirty minutes," was
the answer.
asked for an affidavit of October 20. The
witness went over such portions as he
knew to be untrue.

bitration as yet has been enacted only in
the Australasian colonies of New Zealand
and West Australia, where the system is
very far-reaching. The representatives of
employers and w r orkingmen who have tes
tified before the commission almost uni
formly have opposed compulsory arbitra
tion. Several State boards of arbitration
In the United States also have expressed
their opinion against compulsory arbitra
tion as a general principle and one or two
of the boards have specifically opposed it
in any form. State arbitration boards In
Kev/ York. Indiana, Ohio and Illinois
have compulsion in certain cases, as
where life and public welfare are endan
gered or great inconvenience and loss are
entailed on the people, as in railroad
strikes.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.â The Industrial
Commission to-day made public Its report
on labor disputes and arbitration. It is a
comprehensive document, reviewing the
testimony of the witnesses that have ap
peared before the commission on the sub
ject, and takes up in detail the evidence
on collective bargaining, conciliation. and
arbitration and the laws and court deci
sions governing labor combinations. .Local
systems of collective bargaining and
agreements between employes, it is stat
ed, have been most highly developed in
the building, brewery, boot and shoe,
woodworking and metal trades, - some
branches of the clothing trade and in the
tra importation business; in other words,
both employers and employes are strong
est organized.
By tar the largest number of written
agreements prescribing the conditions of
labor are made between organizations of
where both employers and employes are
strongest organized.
There Is a growing movement in favor
of collective bargaining, conciliation and
arbitration as between organizations of
emplovers and employe*, covering an in
dustry throughout the country, or
throughout large sections, where the con
ditions of business are generally similar.
A growing movement is noted toward es
tablishing- State and local machinery for
arbitration, in the bituminous coal indus
try, where there is now, at least in most
mining districts, no effective method for
disposing of the miner disputes which
arise from time to time. Systems of. ar
bitration as to specific disputes have been
established in a formal manner and on a
national scale in the stove molding, the
general foundry and machinists (now not
in existence) and the printing trades.
Among these the printing trade i3 the
only one which provides for reference of
the dispute to an ' outside person where
tho direct representatives of the two
sides fail to agree. The report praises
State boards of arbitration for doing
much toward furthering industrial peace.

GRAND CHAPTER HAS
INSTALLED OFFICERS
The Sisters of the Holy Family are
working hard and assisting the ladles in
charge of the booth? in completing prep
arations. The priests of the cathedral
are giving their personal attention to the
details, and when the doors open to-night
the programme will be complete. Arch
bishop Riordan will deliver the opening
address. Professor S. J. Sandy will have
cbarge of the Cathedral Choral Society,
and the Knickerbocker quartet and the
Cathedral Mandolin Club will also figure.
Another feature will be the refreshment
booth, in charge of Mrs. Connolly. Every
thing in the line of edibles that man can
wish for will be on the tables, and from
11 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon
a lunch will be spread. This is going to
be an anomaly In church lunches, and the
ladies expect that encores will be the or
der of the days during which the fair is
open.
Mrs. Dr. Pawlicke has the booth of
which she is in charge decorated in rose
pink. â¢ A bevy of the handsomest young
ladies in the parish will assist her in dis
posing of chances and alt kinds of bric-a
brac and fancy things.
A generous rivalry is on between the
Young Ladies' Institute and the Catholic
Ladies' Aid Society as to which will gar
ner the greatest harvest. Both booths are
decorated in the highest style of the art,
and both promise to bring in large re
turns.
Friendly Rivalry Between Them.
Mrs. Mary A. Tobin has a portrait by
Genthe of Archbishop Riordan which is
very lifelike. This is in the cathedral
booth, resplendent with electric lights.
Another thing the ladies have decided
upon Is a contest for the -most popular
candidate for Mayor. Thougn suffrage is
denied them,, tney are prepared to stuft
ihe ballot-box at the rate of 10 cents pet
vote. Registrar Walsh and the Board of
Election commissioners have decided in
this particular instance to overlook any
violation of the election laws.
The State Board of *lsh Commissioners
has given a license to conduct a tish pond.
This will be an elaborate affair, in whicn
gold fish will swim about until the angler
nooks one with a numbered tail.
A splendid lunch will be served. It is
expected that the bazaar will be a grand
success, and if the ladies can do anything
more to make it go they are bound to
do it.
Prepared to Stuff Ballot-Box.
-Â«. replica of a most ancient cathedral
will greet the eye of the visitor upon en
tering. Thence through, the vast hall will
rise bcoth after booth, where matrons and
misses, all in the cause of cathedral
linances, will sell ticKets, raffle! chances
and do all other things that serve to make
a church fair so interesting..
American Beauty roses will be the cen
ter of attraction at St. Mary's grand ba
zaar, which opens to-night at the Me
chanics' Pavilion. It is a long time since
the parishioners of St. Mary's Cathedral
have been called upon to assist in clearing
off the indebtedness that, despite the most
earnest efforts of Archbishop Riordan and
Vicar General Prendergast, hangs over
the sacred center of the Catholic church
in this city.
In the Mechanics' Pavilion ladies who
have long been associated with the church
have prepared a number of enchanting
booths, whore colors symbolizing the vari
ous emblems of their faith have trans
formed the usually bare interior into a
thing of radiance. The color scheme has
been carried throughout the building. One
side is in gold and white; on the other are
all the colors of the rainbow.
LABOR DISPUTES
AND ARBITRATION
The delegates of the Labor Council sincerely
regret the withdrawal of Cariwnters' Union
â¢183. but v/hen the labor movement in any lo
cality arrows strong the employers always try
to hurt it, sometimes throuph forced strike e.
Gometimes through apparent division caused by
the tools of the employers. But the labor
movement has come out with honor from the
recent fights with its enemies and this at
tempt to hurt it will also fail. Th- rank and
file of all the unions of the city will soon rt
alize that labor's strength lies in unity, not in
division.
Labor's Strength in Unity.
The action of the Building Trades Council in
forcing unions out of the Labor Council is in
violation of the law of the American Federa
tion of Labor and the aitlliated national
unions.
The policy of the Building Trades Council
Ik making for the division of labor 1 s forces in
this city and inevitably will result disastrously
to the building trades unions, but as for the
effect of this action on the strength of the
Labor Council this can bo said: There arÂ«
now, as there were yesterday, ninety-eight
unions afttliated with the Labor Council,
another union being admitted to the council
to-night.
To prevent the disintegration of their union
the membeis of 4i3 voted to temporarily with
draw from The Labor Council, leavinar this
matter to be adjusted by the American t edera-
Uouj of Labor and the national unions in
volved.
To Be Adjusted Later.
That union was forced out of the Labor
Council by the action oÂ£ the Building Trades
Council, which under a constitution recently
adopted forbids any of its autliated unions to
belong to the central labor council. Carpen
ters' Union No. 4s3 voted to withdraw from the
Labor Council because members of other
building trades unions struck on buildings
against members of Union 4b3.
A notion was also passed congratulating
Carpenters" Union No. Hi lor its loyalty to
unionism and the hoi>e was expressed tor the
speedy return 01 that union to tne Labor Coun
cil.
'Ihc "following statement given out last
n'gnt by the Labor Council is self-ex
planatory:
The notice of withdrawal from the Labor
Council nnt by Cau>enters" Union Xu. 4&J
was accepted by the council, ana the retiring
president, \\'. H. Goff. delegate trom that
union, was eiven a nsics vote of thanks lor
all the good work done by him lor tne L,abor
council and the cause of traues union. s. n.
Carpenters' Union No. 483 last night
withdrew from membership in the Labor
Council. \V. H. Goff, president of the
Labor Council, being a delegate from No.
4S3, was obliged to retire along with the
othr-r five delegates from his union.
Michael Casey of the Brotherhood of
Teamsters will act as president of the
Council until the election of Goff s suc
cessor.
Matters Will Be Referred
- to National Organ
ization. .
The speaker was severely wounded, but
he nevertheless retained his command
until Atlanta was won. He paid tributes
to the bravery and gallantry of the
enemy. The lecture was frequently inter
rupted by loud applause.
General Howard is visiting relatives in
the city and expects to remain l^re for
some time. He is an enthusiastic church
worker and the proceeds of his lecture
'.ast night will be devoted to association
v.-ork.
General Howard's lecture was chacty,
confidential and interesting. No attempt
at oratory was indulged In by the veteran
warrior. He related numerous anecdotes
of that memorable campaign, dwelling
upon the characteristics of the intrepid
Slierxau, whose genius conceived the
great movement and whose soldierly
qualities that brooked no rebuffs enable*!
him to carry it througrh to a successful
conclusion. Due attention was given to
Snerman's brilliajit generals on tfcst
famous march, and without such men as
Schcficld, Thomas, Logan and Kllpatrick
the invasion of the very heart of the Con
federacy might have ended differently.
The lecturer graphically described the
incidents of the march, which began In
April and ended in September. 1864. Op
posed as the Union army was by sucli
men as Joe Johnston. Hardie and Hood,
every step of the way was bitterly con
tested and marked by the blood of thou
sands. One could almost hear the shn-.-k
of the shells and grape hurtline through
the trees and the ping of musket bu Is
that whistled like hail in every direction.
Gcncr.il O. O. Howard, one oÂ£ the few
Uiiioj! tjcnerals of tho great rebellion still
alive-, and who won fame as '"the Chris
tian soldier," addressed a large audience
at ihc Your.g Men's Christian Association
auditorium on the subject of 'â¢Sherman's
March to the Sea." General Howard took
a:i active part in that significant and d.ir
i;:g movement cÂ£ lSb4. by which the back
bone of tho Confederacy was broken iti*d
jioace ultimately brougtit to a suffering
i.alicn.

Even our discovery of a means of producing plati
num cheaply enough to make it useful in the manu
facture of articles of general use proves to be after
all only the revival of an ancient art. An Egyptian

centuries before Christ.
The Canadian Forestry Association estimates that
the spruce forests of the Dominion are sufficient to
supply the world with pulp wood at the present rate
of demand for 840 years. The showing is good, but
as it takes no account of the waste of forests by fires
it will not be long before a very different estimate
will have to be made. The people of the United
States have had an experience in that way. It is not
leng since some of our experts were estimating that
pine forests were inexhaustible in States where there
is now hardly any pine at all.
General Baden-Powell, whose defense of Mafeking

of men at a tea is so unusual and so very
desirable that I am going to put their

EDITH PRESTON and Willard
Drown are engaged. Handsome
Edith told her happy secret to her
friends, who went down to con
gratulate her sister Norms yester
day afternoon. Although all of us were
unprepared for the splendid news, none of
us were astonished. Previous to Miss
Preston's departure for Europe I was
among the many who asked her v lf she
was engaged to Willard Drown, and I was
also among the select majority to whom
Miss Preston declared "there is not one
word of truth in it."
However, it is out now, and we are all
delighted. There is any amount -of nice
things to be said of the happy young
couple. Willard Drown is a son of A. N.
Drown and a member of the law firm of
Drown, Leicester & Drown. He is a Yale
man, and equally as popular in profes
sional as In social circles.
Edith Preston is one of the handsomest
of the many beautiful girls of the young
er set. She is the daughter of E. F. Pres
ton, the well-known attorney, and Mr.
Preston is not a little proud of the' fact
that his charming daughter is the image
of her dad. Miss Preston, however, has
more than her beauty to recommend her.
She is charming, accomplished and has
unusual tact. While the wedding of Miss
Norma Preston and Worthington Ames
will take place in the very near future,
it will be some time before Edith Preston
becomes Mrs. Willard Drown.
By Sally Sharp.
It appears the fight will have to be made with the
utmost energy, for the danger is seemingly much
greater than Californians expected. The Times says
in the South there is a d*emand for Chinese labor to
supplant the negro, and of the East it says: '-The
general feeling seems to be that the Chinese as we
know them, are a peaceable, industrious race, who
trouble nobody, and if not molested. by hoboes and
Hooligans mind their own business and fill a very
useful place. The excitement of twenty years ago
over the inundation of this country by a tidal wave
of Mongolian immigration has completely subsided
and it would be impossible to revive it." . .
If such statements represent Eastern sentiment we
may as well get ready for a hard contest this winter.
The work of educating the East must begin all over
again. Evidently Minister Wu has been sawing wood
while we were asleep, and it looks now as if he had
the exclusion law very nearly beaten.
In discussing the question the New York Times
recently said: "The initiative in the opposition to
the continuance of the restrictions now imposed
comes naturally from the Chinese, but if the reports
which reach us are correct the movement is gaining
strength among Eastern and Southern Congress
men, many of whom are reaching the conclusion
that there are large areas of the United States where
an important increase of cheap labor would be ad
vantageous. The interest in continuing the present
stringent law is confined largely to the Pacific Coast,
and whether it is there as strong as the leaders of the
labor organizations would have us believe is a ques
tion which it is difficult to answer without a more in
timate knowledge of public opinion on this subject
than can be gained from the newspapers of the Cali
fornia cities."
If Eastern people do not believe that the white peo
ple of the Pacific Coast are universally agreed in
favor of Chinese exclusion they are the victims of a
delusion. The fight against anything like unrestricted
immigration from China will be made not only by
labor leaders and the newspapers of California cities,
but by well nigh every fighting force among the
people.
ONE of the notable phases of drift of public
sentiment at present is the increasing favor
with which a considerable number of influen
tial people in the East regard the possibility of an
unrestricted Chinese immigration to this country.
It required a prolonged and often an excited cam
paign of education to convince Eastern people years
ago that Chinese immigration would be a curse, and
now the moment the processes of education have
ceased they seem to have relapsed into their former
condition of ignorance or indifference.
. It is stated by the Consul that although the topo
graphical features of the country will render the work
of construction difficult, and the severe winters will
close the canals for a considerable time each year,
the system will be of incalculable benefit to the whole
country, and will connect Austria more closely with
Germany and with Russia. It is said that not only
will the cost of freights from the German seaports be
appreciably less, but many portions of the interior
now practically inaccessible to extensive trade can
then be successfully developed.
The undertaking of an enterprise of such impor
tance and of such undoubted benefits to the people
will of course go far toward relieving the discontent
of the people. There will be employment 'at good
wages for thousands of men, and the money put into
circulation will increase trade 'and activity. The
scheme is therefore an exhibition of a high order of
statecraft on the part of the Austrian Ministry. It is
better to put an end to discontent by furnishing
work and wages than to" try to suppress it by the
despotism of the sword.
In the aggregate the new canals will open upward
of 1054 miles of navigable waterways, and it is esti
mated the cost will be about $152,000,000. The money
is to be provided by the co-operation of the prov
inces, districts and cities that are to be mainly bene
fited with the Government. The work of construc
tion is to begin not later than 1904, and is to be so
calculated that the whole system will be completed
within twenty years. To provide money for imme
diate use the Government is to issue 4 per cent, tax
free, bonds, redeemable within ninety years.
CONSUL GENERAL HURST of Vienna has
furnished to the State Department an inter
esting report upon the grand scheme of canal
construction which has been undertaken by the Aus
trian Government for the double purpose of improv
ing the commercial facilities of the different parts of
the empire and of holding it together as a political
unity. In its entirety the plan is larger than any
other designed for canal work in Europe, and when
completed will provide Austria with a system of in
ternal waterways that will prove of immense advan
tage to her people. . .
The measure recently enacted by the Government
provides for â (1) a canal from the Danube to the
River Oder; (2) a canal from the Danube to the
Maldau, near Budweis, and the improvement of that
river so as to fit it for canal boats from Budweis to
Prague; (3) a canal from the Danube-Oder canal to
the Upper Elbe and the improvement of the Elbe as
far as Melnik; (4) a canal from the Danube-Oder
canal to the Vistula and to some navigable portion of
the Dniester.
.CHINESE EXCLUSION.
AUSTRIA'S 'CANAL. SCHEMES.
The assumption that mere public ownership of a
water supply makes it potable is not borne out by the
facts, since its potability depends upon the vigilance
with which its purity is preserved, and there is no
evidence that this will be any greater .under muni
cipal ownership. Indeed, the presumption . is the
other way, unless municipal government can be in
faitd with a different spirit and a greater fidelity to
the trust imposed upon it. We desire merely to curb
the enthusiasm of the advocates of municipal pater
nalism by bringing them down to consider that every
large city rises between elections to complain of the
bad state of its streets, gutters, sewers and all other
things that are now the objects of municipal care and
administration. If the New York Journal see bugs
in Croton water and declare that it smells to heaven,
compelling the purchase and use of spring* water to
avoid fatal results, and the Examiner see in muni
cipal ownership water purified, glorified and made
perfect and potable, there is a jog in the testimony
that makes thinking people pause and consider.
The death rate in San Francisco is given at 23.6
per thousand. We suffer in the statistics from the
location of the city and its being the last refuge of a
large number of sojourners who come here stricken
and die. It is to be regretted that such cases are not
segregated from the deaths of our resident and per
manent population. But New" York, that is not
sought as a health resort, has a death rate of 28.6, and
Boston of 24.8, Washington of 25.8, and Philadelphia
of 22.6. Eliminating the deaths of sojourners, there
is no doubt that the rate per 1000 of our resident
population is less than the lowest.
We have pointed out the neglect of cities which
own their water supply to purify it, and have
shown the power of cities to compel the purification
of a supply in private ownership.
WE recently quoted from a Philadelphia
paper in relation to the prevalence of ty
phoid in that city, dne to the water supply.
The Examiner retorted statistically in vindication of
the purity of water effected simply by change from
private to public ownership. We have no doubt that
the public water of Chicago, Philadelphia, New York
and Boston saves many lives in the same manner that
lives are saved by brass pins â by not swallowing
them. .. Within the last eight months the New York
Journal published accounts of the filthy condition of
the Croton water, and showed how fortunes were
made by peddling spring water in that city for drink
ing purposes at a high price per bucket. It is not un
usual for the Journal and Examiner to sing one tune
in the spring and another in the fall.
WATER .AND TYPHOID.
At present we have no advice to give beyond again declaring that all voters wh<J
are interested in the welfare of the city should accept for a fact that there must be a
substantial pooling of their votes for one of the regular candidates for Mayor. Their,
choice must be guided by the action of those candidates. If either of them do not see
this, and weaken himself by follies that eannot be condoned, his fate be upon his own
head. Never was there less prompting to merely partisan action than now. Never were
party lines more obscure and party feeling less spontaneous. Never were there less obli
gations to party and greater to the welfare of the whole city.
As far as loyalty to the Republican party is concerned, it was not present in the
so-called Republican convention. The loyalty of the majority of that convention ran to
influences outside the party that are degrading. The convention's loyalty to these in
fluences was disloyalty to the party, and,, per. contra, loyalty to the party means repudia
tion of the convention and its works.
The painful /and pitiful situation was foretold by, The Call, and we' did what we
could to prevent it. But our warning fell upon deaf ears, and the party name and pres
tige were seized to make a banner for elements that are as unRepublican as they are dis
loyal to every municipal interest.
One could wish that in the face of the peril that is seen by all clear-eyed men, the
men who usurped control of the organization would be sobered and chastened into the
correction of their, blunders, and would at least try" tc put the, head of their ticket in a
position to offer the best hope ior the city's rescue. But, as to do this would be an ex
hibition of natural politics, they have proved so far incapable of it, and appear to de
pend entirely upon the base and artificial methods with which they are best acquainted.
We have refrained from sudden judgment of their acts and have warned them in time to
enable a change in their methods. We warn them again that we speak for a multitude
of the best Republicans in this city, and with a desire solely to avert a misfortune that
will leave welts upon San Francisco as if she had been scourged with whips.
Yet the politicians, who are supposed to have sense enough to consider the com
munity as a whole, have created a highly artificial situation in which it is possible for I
strictly class ticket to hope for success. . â¢ , ,
SINCE our last reference to the risk that lies in the coming city election, events
have brought more clearly before our people a prospective result of the gravest
I character.
The situation emphasizes the political folly of permitting mere artifice end
scheming to control the action of conventions called and held in the name of a party ?nd
supposed to represent its organization. Had natural politics been permitted, the Repub
lican party might have been represented by a ticket that throughout would have com
manded public respect and have been assured of victory from the moment of its nom
ination...'Unfortunately the Democratic ticket, except the candidates for Supervisors,
offers certain elements of political and popular weakness where it should be in both re
spects strong. We arc convinced that the head of one regular ticket must be elected
Mayor if the future sufcty of the city is to be considered. Just why the head of the Repub
lican ticket continues to increase the improbability of his success, is unknown to us, and
perhaps to himself. Republicans would prefer to sail the city into a calmer future by
supporting the head of the ticket, if he would permit them to do so.
;Thc present situation is risky of a result that will give to the, head of the class
ticket a fictitious strength, which will be mistaken by those who made that ticket for real
strength, and for an indorsement of the excesses which marked the progress of the late
industrial disturbance. All men know what this will mean, but it will be too late to cor
rect the mistake when capital is in full flight and labor is pinched by , the exiling of
enterprise. | N .
The only rift in the cloud that overhangs the city is the straightforward declara
tion of the Building Trades Council that "this municipality is . best governed when
public servants are selected from the entire community, without regard to any par
ticular class." â¢ i - '\u25a0 â¢ v

minutes west, the American passed the
British bark Formosa from Antwerp for
San Diego. The captain asked to be re

coaling in the West Indian port she met
with a mishap that will necessitate her
going on the drydock here. The tide went

The Australia was delayed at Papeete
owing to the arrival of the Australian
mail steamer Taviuni. It is a rule of the
port that any vessel which has discharged
must gi into the stream to make room
for the next vessel that comes in. Ac
cordingly, when the Taviuni came in the
Australia had to zo into the stream to
make room for her and in consequence it
was Sunday afternoon instead of Satur
day morning when the mail boat got away
for San Francisco.
On September SO. in latitude 10 degrees
south, loagitude 145 degrees west, the pas
sengers and crew en the Australia wit
nessed the formation of a waterspout.
Captain Lawless says that in all the
years he has been to sea he never wit
nessed such a sight before. A cloud no
bigger than a man's hand appeared on
the horizon and approached the steam
ship rapidly, growing as it advanced.
Suddenly it stopped and a white space,
like a funnel, appeared in the midst of it.
Simultaneously the ocean under the cloud
began to boiJ and gradually rise up to
meet the vapor. Several times the water
fell back, only to rise higher the next
time, but just .as water and cloud were
about to join the disturbance made by
the Australia as she rushed through the
water broke the connection and the dis
play was over.
The Australia took the account of Pres
ident McKinley's death to Tahiti. She
signaled the news of the assassination to
the man-of-war Durance and the captain
of that vessel sent the news to the United
States Consul, and at the same time put
his flag at half mast.
The Australia brought up nineteen cab
in, seven second cabin and five steerage
passengers. Those in the first cabin were:
parted were the Pacific Mail Com
pany's Acapuleo, which sailed for Pana
ma and way ports, and the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company's Arequipa for Cen
tral and South American ports. The
American-Hawaiian Steamship Com

before daybreak and the Oceanic Steam

D. T. Ames, who was chief of the hand
writing? exDerts employed by the Govern
ment during the famous Molineux mur
der trial, states that in his opinion the
decision recently rendered by the New
-York State Supreme Court will result in
the acquittal of the young millionaire.
; The chief factor in the evidence result
ing in the conviction of Molineux at the
former trial was the testimony of the ex
perts that the person who addressed the
package which poisoned Mrs. Adams wa3
the same as the one who was responsible
for the Barnett.and Cornish forgeries. In
the forthcoming trial this evidence can
not be admitted, and as there is little else
detrimental to the defendant's case it is
quite possible that he may go free.
Mr., Ames savs that he is firmly con
vinced of ' Molineux's guilt and that an
acquittal will be a gross miscarriage of
justice. To prove that Molineux wrote
the address on the fatal package of bro
mo-seltzer it was necessary to use the let
ters which it is alleged he wrote to va
ritms medical firms under the names of
Barnett and Cornish. The court holds
that the latter were not sufficiently au
thenticated to be used as a standard and
the prosecution loses the groundwork of
I its case.
Supreme Court Decision Is
Death Blow to the
Prosecution.

The principal island of the Marquesas is
750 miles from Tahiti. Governor Feutier
is very anxious that ]the steamers should
call at this island, both going and com
ing. He says this Island produces the
largest quantity of mother-of-pearl of any
place in the world, and a mutual benefit
could be established by the steamers call
ing in there.
Inspector General Lefevre is also en
route to Paris. He is returning after a
tour of iiispeet!on of the military force
stationed at Tahiti.
Governor Paul Feutier of the Marquesas
Islands arrived here yesterday en route
to Paris to take a vacation and Is staying
at the Grand. He says that the new
steamship service between this port and
Tahiti, which was instituted by the
Oceanic Steamship Company, is of great
tx-nelit to everybody.
Governor Fentier cays the commerce
between this city and Tahiti is rapidly in
creasing and that within a short time all
the merchandise purchased in the islands
will come from San Francisco.
The natives of Tahiti are not anxious to
work, says Governor Feutier. as nature
in that part of the world is most gener
ous. The natives live on a vegetarian and
fruit diet. Bananas and bread fruit grow
in great quantities, and consequently the
natives do not have to work. On the next
trip of a steamer from San Francisco a
large shipment cf meat will be made as
an experiment.

WHAT CAUSES DANDRUFF.
Greatest European Authority on Skin
Diseases, Savs It's a Germ.
The old Idea that dandruff Is scales of
eHii thrown off through a feverish con-
dition of the scalp is exploded. Professor
tTnna. Hamburg, Germany, European au-
thority on skin diseases, says dandruff is
a germ disease. The germ burrows under
the pcalp. throwing up little scales of
cuticle and sapping- the vitality of the
hair at the root. The only hair prepara-
tion that kills dandruff germs is Newbro's
Herpicide. "Destroy the cause, you re-
move the effect." Xot only cures dan-
druff, but stops falling hair and causes a
luxuriant growth. Delightful hair dress-

"NEW YORK, Oct. IS.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Unfavorable signs are rare in the business
outlook. Manufacturing industries . enjoy ex
ceptional activity and most jobbers and re
tailers find no occasion for complaint. Mild
weather is the one influence that j may be
charged with retarding retail merchandise dis
tribution, yet it is the general opinion that
sales thus postponed will be made up later.
The same Influence is invaluable In facili
tating the handling 1 of crops, erecting buildings
and other outdoor work. Although a fifth of
the year is still to be heard from, including
the usual interrUDtion of elections and possi
ble disturbance of legislation, there is good
evidence that the volume of legitimate business
will largely exceed all rrevious records. Specu
lation is comparatively quiet, both in securi
ties and outlons, on leading products, whicli
emphasizes the activity in trade channels, as
shown by bank exchanges for the week at New
York 33 per cent larger than last year and 8.4
above IS99, while at other leading cities the
gnins were 16.3 and 9.1 per cent, respectively.
Strength without inflation still characterizes
the iron and steel situation. .Despite two
months of Interruption by the strike, evidence
accumulates that the year will surpass all
records in production of finished material and
consequently in consumption of ore and
plgircn. Orders already booked for de
livery far into 1902 promise that next
year will bring still higher records, and
the steadiness of prices makes the outlook
especially favorable. Mills a3 a rule have
practically closed contracts for all the order*
that can be filled this year and future devel
opments can only affect conditions In 1902 as
to finished steel. Heavy orders are recorded
for rails, with a free movement of structural
material, while wire and wire nails go abroad
in large quantities. Pieriron is hardening un
under the various demand, forge and Southern
foundry securing definite advances, and Bes
semer in Plttsburg is firm at $16.
Tin nlates are almost restored to normal
prices. Since domestic mills have resumed and
imports ceased the London market has de
clined sharply. Copper rose In the face of re
r-orts that a large reduction in list prices was
contemplated by leading producers to reduce
stocks. Footwear factories still have many
weeks' full employment on heavy-weight goods
for winter. Supplementary orders for season
able lines still arrive from Eastern Jobbers.
Prices . are not quotably higher, though the
rapid rise of leather and hides has taken so
much of the profit that shoes must soon de
tprlorate In quality, if better quotations are not
forthcoming. C
Leather has berun to exhibit symptoms of
speculation, but buying by the leading manu
facturers for actual consumption "also reaches
a lanre total. ....
"Woolen Roods are more quiet, yet shipments
of ovpr 5.000.000 pounds of wool weekly from
Bnrtcn indicates no decrease in activity at the
miRs. \u25a0
â¢Fluctuations In cereals were small, with
market!" d>:ll and featureless. "Wheat -lost a
little of the early* gain, although declining
prices a year ago make the difference smaller
than it has- been at any time this crop year. I
Forpisrn buylnÂ«r of flour is still unsatisfac

NEW YOHK. Oct. IS.â Attention was wholly
centered en the Northern Facific question to-
Gay, end the more the operators In stocks
ptud'.ed the problem the more they did not
understand it. The continued activity of
"Vortbern Pa<-:Sc preferred, in striking con
trast to its stagnant condition up to yester
dav over since the corner of the common
KlJck. was the occasion of interest in the street.
Conjecture exhausted itself in framing rumors
that would givv a plausible explanation of this
development- The c&aciusion seemed unavoid
able tr.at active steps were- being taken in the
Northern Pacific settlement, although there
were some observers bold enough to claim that
the transactions in Northern Pacific preferred
did not represent genuine transfers of the stock
at ali. Th:s interpretation wss strained, but
it serves to illustrate the completely mystified
condition in the street. Another rather far
fetched explanation was that the new Burling
ton raiiwav incorporated "Wednesday would ex
change its' stock ior the bonds which were is
eued jointly by Northern Pacific and Great
Northern in exchar.se for the Burlington 6tock
purehafc. This operation would be in effect
to canoe! the whole Burlington deal and thus
remove the cause of conflict for control of
Northern Pacific. But this would not explain
the absence cf a Fir.gle share of Northern Pa
cific common In the dealings. That it might
be a satisfactory solution to some of the cap
italists concerned In the venture was not
doubted. The broad intimations from sources
usually accredited to Morgan influences of the
undoubted right of the Northern Pacific Com
pany to retire Northern Paciflc preferred caused
an uneasy feeling that the whole dispute was
In danger of breaking out again, although the
urging of such a .c'.aim without enforcing it
might be des'.Eneil to exert moral influence
upon the points in the settlement.
The source of the selling in Northern Pacific
preferred continued to be shrouded in mystery,
and the fact that Harriman brokers were
employed in come of the selling added to the
confusion of sentiment, whether designedly or
:io. As it is believed that the Morgan-Hill
claims to aticolute control rest entirely upon
their holding of a majority of the common
stock with a proposed retirement of the pre
ferred, it was ingeniously ruggested that their
holdings of tha preferred might be coming
upen the market. But this would not explain
the advancing price of the preferred, which
reached 1C8% at one time to-day. This served
also to refute the suggested retirement at par.
Another suggestion was that a valuation above
par might be designed for the Mock in the
terms of exchange v.-ith the stock of the in
tended recurities holding company, it was
significant that in all this whirl of rumor and
FUFjrCFtion thrre was no further sugges
tion that the plans for community of interest
were to be taken j:p where they left off when
the May 9 cyclone interrupted them. The
course of the market was generally downward,
resulting in reducing or wiping out the early
fTainK except in F;>ecial instances, notably
Hrork'yn Rapid Transit and Amalgamated
Copper. There was ancther sale of 200 shares
of Lake Shore at a further advance of lo
lio!ntf=. There was strength in Lackawanna.
the J.!Â«nnÂ«apolis and St. I^ouis stocks, the Iowa
Or.tral stocks. Leather preferred and other
]*tb jirominent stocks. To-morrow's hank
statement, with a decrease in cash indicated
of leFS than two million dollars, will depend
upon the loan account. Total sales were 516.000
shares.
The railroad bond market was pretty firm,
owing to the demand for some of the converti
ble bonrls. Total sales, par value, $2.06i,OOO.
I'nited States bonds were all unchanged on

CHICAGO. Oct. 18.â December wheat at the

response to an advance at Liverpool and ad
ditional news of the evil effects of dry weather
in Argentine. The market started with sales
ranging from 70%@71c to 70%. Liberal buying
for the long account .and covering sent the
price up to 71',ic during the afternoon, and
although there was fair selling by traders who
were disappointed at the slack export demand
and an advance in ocean freights the market
held firm and December closed %c up at 70%@

Corn was moderately active and prices held
steady under the strengthening influence of
wheat. December closed %c higher at 56%Â®

Wheat and Other. Grains.
WHEAT â The market is showing more tone
all over the world. Paris and Liverpool fu
tures were both higher. The Continent, how
ever, is responding slowly to the Improvement,
at least as far as American wheat is concerned.
Argentine cables report 6till further damage
to the crop by drought, and say that the pros
pects are for a small crop. The amount on
passage to the. United Kingdom has decreased
materially during the past month. .
Chicago opened firmer on the better foreign
advices, and rose lc. There was some foreign
buying. There Is still .a large short Interest
to be reckoned with, however. The West and
Southwest and commission houses are big buy
ers.
This market was more active and higher
again on call, but the shipping grades showed
no further "Improvement.

Harrison's circular ?ays:
â¢â¢During the wtek there have been five c!eliv
cries ot Washington coal, 14.7bS ton.*; two trom
British Columbia, SSSO ton*; two trom Oregon,
1'j70 tons;, one from Caru'Lf, ' Â£<7S tun.;; to.<tl,
27,-ia*i tons. For the moment thcr..- U uufflcicni
coal en hand for all immediate demands, and
every endeavor is being mailu to get enough
shipped so as to create- a resrrve to yard tor
the winter requirement*. As neari;- ait tha
coal now being mined in British Columbia awl
'Washington Is transported to market by .steam,
any shortage here can bo speedily male sou. I.
It is believed the recent accidents to the Well
ington colliery will be seriously felt by tha
retailers here, aa this is the atasoo when tnU
grade is in active demand for domestic use.
Substitutes will be provided, *i> that consum
ers will not sutler for fuel, and prices will rÂ»
main undisturbed; besides, there will be oc
casional cargoes of Wellington coal received.
Steam grades arc in fair supply at ruling rates-,
and fuel oil Is being freely =hippe<l. A canvass
has been made of the number of consumers who
have modified their plants aince the beginning
of last year from coal to oil, and it is founj
that very nearly 150 are now using oil ex
clusively. As several of these were very heavy
buyers, coal producers thus find their saies
diminishing. If oil had not intervened this
year to aid our steam production we wouM
have had a partial famine in the coal market."

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Canadian failures for the week number 29, as
against 35 last week, 22 in this week a year ago,
20 in 1S99, 24 in 1898 and 48 in 1807.
Failures in the United States number 198. as
against 173 last week, 283 this week a year ago,
221 in 1899 and 213 in 1898.
Cooler weather and fear of frosts, coupled
with good reports from the print cloth industry,
have stimulated raw cotton and this In turn
is restricted in higher quotations for nearly all
leading bleached cottons. 'Woolen goods are
rather quiet as regards new demand, but the
mills are busy on heavy-weights and when these
are out of the way a large volume of orders for
spring weights guarantees continued activity.
Wool is steady and firm with a large con
sumption progressing.
Iron and steel consumption continue fully
equal and, in some cases, in excess of produc
tions. Features. this week have been the sale
by merchant furnaces In the Plttsburg district
of 75.CC0 tons of Bessemer piglron to leading
interests at from $15 25 to $15 50 per ton at Val
ley furnaces. Steel billets have continued scarce
and are practically unobtainable for prompt de
livery, though $27 and ?28 per ton is offered,
against the nominal quotation of $26 for dis
tant delivery. Pigiron stocks in the Central
West are said to not exceed one week's supply.
Orders for fully 1,000,000 tons of rails for next
year's delivery have been booked, although the
principal consuming interest has not yet ap
portioned its business, which is expected to ex
ceed 165,000 tons. Plates, bars and sheets and
structural material are all active, but iron bars
are reported easier. Tin-plate mills are catch-
Ing up with their orders and a cut Is reported
in the price of wire nails.
Railroads are in the market for cars and one
"Western system has bought 20C0 this week.
Export business in iron and steel is not prom
isins.
NEW' YORK, Oct. IS.â Bradstreefs to-morrow
will say:
Among the notable features brought out in
trade dispatches to Bradstreet's this week are
the reports of stimulated retail trade, due . to
cooler settled weather and advices of continued
activity in all leading Industrial lines, notably
iron and steel, shoes and leather, coal, lumber,
jewelry and cotton and woolen goods. The
shipments of products of these industries and
of groceries to consuming sections continue
heavy and are accompanied by reports of de
lays due to the scarcity of cars. Another one
of those slight upward swings in prices of sta
ples, so numerous of late, has also occurred by
which the general level of cereals, raw cotton,
dairy products and lake copper has been raised.
Clearings have expanded because of an exten
sion of interest in the security markets, but
also because of continued good collections,
which, in turn," have induced rather more ease
in money rates at leading markets. Advices
from the South are still of a backward cotton
crop movement, hampering fall demand and col
lections, but even here there has been an im
provement noted this week.

TRIBUTE TO MEMORY
OF AGNES M. MANNING
Wells was in Austin's house, claiming
to be there to protect Mrs. A. Hamilton,
who had sworn to a complaint charging
the saloon man with battery. Austin de
manded admittance and on being refused
he kicked the door down. W ells fired trom
the Inside and Austin returned the lire,
both men emptying their pistols. They
then erappled and beat one another with
the empty weapons. When they could
fight no longer they agreed to quit and
walked to town a quarter of a mile and
had their wounds dressed by physicians.
Both men will recover. Austin was be
hind his bar two hours after the shoot
ing, apparently little the worse for the
bullet wounds.
MADERA, Oct. 18.â Howard Wells, a
Deputy Sheriff, and George Austin, a
saloon-keeper, engaged in a shooting
scrape this afternoon, in which both men
were wounded. Wells was shot in the
left hand, and Austin was shot once in
the right thumb, once in the right arm
and once in the left breast just below the
collar bone.

On the afternoon qf Thursday, October
31, a vaudeville entertainment . is to be
given at the Alhambra Theater for the
benefit of the Nurses' Training School and
Home at the. City and County . Hospital.
Many ladies influential in, society, in phi
lanthropy and in the clubs are deeply in
terested in this affair and they promise
that it shall be musically, dramatically
and socially a grand event.
The Associated Theatrical Managers,
through their secretary, Melville. Marx,
have promised the free use of the Alham
bra; Mr. Morrisey will direct the talent,
which will be x>t the most popular and
superior class,, and a bevy of beautiful
girls will form the reception committee.
Dashing posters- from well known-artists
will soon appear in conspicuous places an
nouncing the event, and the programme
is to be something unique and surprising.
It will be designed by Mrs. Susan Loosely.
The beneficiary institution, the San
Francisco Training School for Nurses, has
now been for six years under the prln
clpalship of Miss Mary Patton, who has
been assisted in the duties of instruction
by an able corps of San Francisco's lead
ing physicians. From seventeen pupils zlx
years ago the student body has grown to
a membership of fifty, and ninety well
trained nurses have been graduated into
professional life. Several of these hold'
positions of exceptional trust and respon
sibility. The undergraduates perform all
the nursing duties and the ward house
keeping of the big hospital, and this.serv
ice, unknown before the days of the train
ing school, has created a most wholesome
revolution in the methods at the hospital.
The physicians greatly appreciate the
trained aid given them, and the patients
have an intelligent and constant care
given them equal to that of any institu
tion in the country. ,
The funds derived from the matinee of
the 31st will be devoted to the furnishing
and arranging of a commodious reception
room, at the hospital, where the students
may assemble for rest, 1 recreation and
study. At present they have only th'eir
crowded dormitories, where the receiving
cf friends or any real relaxation from
their strenuous duties is impossible
The patronesses of the affair are the

Shortly after O'Brien gave the option,
for $2500, which was at the rate of $4 50
per acre,' gold was discovered on the land,
and John Hays Hammond and his associ
ates offered O'Brien 5100 per. acre, for the
same, but tl*e option stood in J.he way.
O'Brien's land and other lands embraced
in the options mentioned above were de
sired by the California Debris Commis
sion as a site for a restraining dam to
check the flow of slickens into the
Feather and Sacramento rivers. The
hydraulic miners were very anxious that
the deal with the Government should be
consummated so that they might be per
mitted to resume work in that vicinity.
Strong representations on their- behalf
were made to the United States Attorney
General, and he sent a telegram to United
States District Attorney Woodworth .to
institute proceedings against O'Brien to
enforce the option so that the work of
constructing the dams may begin at once.
The suit was filed yesterday in obedi
ence to that Instruction. Mr. Woodworth
is confident that the Government will win
the suit and that in a very short time the
work of constructing the dams will be
under way. . \u25a0

The purpose of the festival is to raise
money for the completion of the new
Church of the Redeemer. It will continue
for all of next week. ,
The bazaar which is being held in the
Church of the Redeemer, KIghteenth and
Diamond streets, is proving an unpre
cedented success. People not only from
Eureka Valley but from all parts of the
city visit the festival nightly. They are
drawn thither by the attractively deco
rated booths and the equally if not more
attractive young ladies who have charge
of the affair.
The ladies of Rev. Father McQuaid's
parish have worked incessantly to make
the bazaar a complete success and to their
efforts its undiminished popularity Js due.
One novel' feature of the bazaar not be
fore attempted is the entire absence of
the use of persuasion in securing pur
chasers for the articles in the booths.
The articles are left to speak for them
selves. The receipts of the bazaar thus
far show that the new plan is working as
well if not better than the old.

COMMITTING BOBBERY
Zachary T. George Jr.. an employe of
the Santa Fe Railroad Company, will
have to pay his wife, whom he is suing
for divorce on the ground of desertion, $20
a month alimony while the suit is pend
ing. When the suit was filed by George
his wife filed an answer and cross com
plaint, in which she also alleged deser
tion. She then brought suit for alimony,
which was opposed by her husband on the
ground that she had money enough to
support her. Mrs. George, who before her
rr.arriage was Louise Arguello of the fa
mous Spanish family of that name, testi
fied yesterday that she had inherited $45,
000, but of that sum, owing to misman
agement, she had received only $6000. She
said that through her husband's misman
agement of her affairs the last named sum
had been dissipated and that all she pos
sessed now was $500, which was loaned
out. Her husband's lawyers sought to
prove that she had money enough to pay
Attorney Thomas Cannon $50 for a decree
of divorce, but Judge Graham stated that
he had heard enough and ordered the
young husband to pay, in addition to the
alimony, $40 counsel fees.
Philip Carroll, an employe of the Con
sumers' Ice Company, was adjudged
guilty of contempt ot court by Judge
Sloss yesterday because he had not paid
his divorced wife $25 a month alimony
since 1894. Carroll will be punished for
his dereliction November 8.

COURT ORDERS GEORGE
TO PAY WIFE ALIMONY
Judge Ellsworth's decision was rendered
in a case especially designed to test the
decisions of Judges Troutt and Belcher,
declaring that marriages contracted in
Reno or any other place outside the State
within a year of divorce are illegal. Under
the decision of Judges Troutt and Belcher
it was held that -divorce in California did
not become absolute until a year after
the decree was handed down. Upon the
point of time when absolute divorce be
gan Judge Ellsworth differed from this
opinion in that he maintained that it en
sued immediately after the decree was
handed down. And it was upon thla point
of time that the entire decision rested.
The suit decided to-day was a friendly
one brought by Mrs. Mary C. Wilson
against her husband. John L. Wilson, to
test the validity of their marriage on
March 12. 1900, at Reno, after the husband
had secured a divorce from a former wifo
in California. Mrs. Wilson lived apart
from her husband after having employed
Attorney Colvin In prosecute the action
for an annullment of the marriage. She
expressed her pleasure when the decision
was rendered against the contention for
which she had engaged counsel. . \u25a0 â¢
â¢Reno marriages â the kind that Califor
nia divorcees enter into because the law
makes them wait a year after their disen
gagement from the old tie before they can
again be wedded â are held by Judge Ells
worth to be legal, in contradiction of
Judge Troutt and ex-Judge Belcher of the
San Francisco bench, who threw several
hundred couples into confusion some time
ago by deciding that such contracts are
illegal. Judge Ells worth's decision, which
follows that handed down by Judge Heb
bard of San Francisco, does not ease the
consciences of the Reno-married a bit, for
they won't be certain now whether they
are married or not, the judgments of the
well-known jurists named conflicting.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. 18.
At the meeting were present the prin
cipal members of the Suey Donsrs and the
Quong Ducks. Both factions have been
warring for some time. After the presi
dent of the Six Companies announced that
it had been decided to recompense the
widowed mother of the slain Chinaman
the member? of the fignting tongs agreed
to call it off. The "pipe of peace," the
symbol of the Six Companies, was then
alternately smoked by the rival factions
and present hostilities were formally de
clared cff.
It was understood that on account of
the peace settlement no further attempt
would be made to avenge the murder of
Yee Kitt or assist the police in running
down his cowardly assassins.
There will be no further trouble in
Chinatown, if the word of the warring
tcngs can be relied upon. Last night the
Chinese Six Companies met and decided
to pay the mother of Yee Kitt, who was
foully murdered a short time ago, $300;
The money was given to the brother o*
the murdered man, who faithfully prom
ised not to avenge the assassination of
his relative.

"How to stop the use of coffee was a
question.
"The doctor told me I had a coffee liver.
"I knew I was a' wreck, physically and
nervously, but I never dreamed that cof-
fee was the cause of the trouble. I
could not drink milk, and tea was as bad
for me as coffee. ,
"Hot water was nauseating. I therefore
turned to Postum Food Coffee, got a pack-
age and made it according to directions
end found it just the thing I needed.
"Husband had no faith in it, so I made
coffee for him and Postum for myself.
For three years I used Postum and the
change it has wroug-ht is wonderful.
"Instead of being thin, sallow, nervous,
weak and miserable. I am plump, with
clear complexion, pink cheeks, and seem
to have the endurance and vitality of a
young woman of twenty, although I am
J twice that age. Husband, after seeing
\u25a0^ the change Postum has made, finally
\ ask?d me not to make coffee for him any
more, as he preferred Postum. It has tnien
a Godsend to our family." Myra J. Tul-

AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 18.â "William H.
Mealey, the American mining- man. who
was imprisoned at Porfirio Diaz, Mexico,
for several days -without cause, as he and
his friend claim, has appealed to tho
authorities at Washington for the ap
pointment of a commission whose duties
it shall be to make a thorough investiga
tion of the alleged persecution at the
hands of the Mexican authorities. Mealey
asserts. that he\ has been defrauded out
of his rights to mining properties valued
at nearly $2,000,000, and he wants a thor
ough and impartial investigation made of
the whole matter. In a letter received to
day from Mealey he reviews the difficulty
that was experienced in satisfying the de
mands of the Federal District Judge at
Porfirio Diaz in the matter of the bond.
The bond was fixed at $3500, and the Judge
insisted that the bondsmen be residents
of Porfirio Diaz, a little town containing
few Americans and where Mealey was lit
tle known. Mealey's friends finally got
the order rescinded and then tendered
$3500 in gold. The Judge refused to accept
the gold, and -lemanded that the bond be
made of national bank bills. State cur
rency of general circulation was also re
fused. There was not a sufficient amount
of national bank bills in the town to make
up the bond and there was considerable
delay in getting them from other parts of
the country. It Is asserted that there is a
small business combination or clique re
cently established in Mexico which, com
posed as it is of descendants of Mexican
families of high official power, is exerting
an influence most baneful on American
investments and which is Imputed" to have
taken an active part in Mealey's prosecu
tion, with the object of forcing him to
desist ftom asserting his legal rights to
valuable properties which are claimed by
Mexicans. â¢

Owen Bly, the section boss in charge of
the work, was placed- under arrest. He
was later taken to the Harlem Police
Court and remanded to the Coroner's of
fice, where Coroner Zucca paroled him un
til to-morrow.
When the rescuing party began to re
move the rock they found the mangled
bodies of O*Hara, Kelleher and Coronski.
The bodies of Madden and Danife were
burled under masses of rock which had to
be shattered by blasts before they could
be removed. No more bodies were found
and it is now believed no more lives were
lost.
Domenico de Petro, taken to the hospi
tal with scalp wounds and broken leg 1 .
Italian laborer, name unknown. Injured
about the left foot.
The section of the tunnel where the
cave-in occurred is 105 feet below the sur
face. A shaft leads to the tunnel, and
from the shaft headings extend north and
south, each being about 700 feet long. The
accident occurred in the south heading of
the tunnel, about 640 feet from the shaft.
A gang of twenty rock drillers was work
ing in the extreme south end of the head
ing, and about fifty feet from the end a
gang made up of twenty muckers and a
foreman was removing the debris pro
duced by the blasting.
Without warning a mass of rock sixty
three feet long, eleven feet wide and ten
feet high and weighing about 150 tons, fell
with a tremendous crash directly where
the muckers were working, almost clos
ing the tunnel and creating a panic among
the two or three hundred men at work in
othsr sections. Great clouds of dust filled
the whole excavation.
At first it was supposed that at least a
dozen men had been buried under the de
bris. Word of the accident had been
quickly spread and soon an anxious crowd
gathered around the shaft, scores of men
and women crying and wringing their
hands, while the rescuers worked with
tremendous energy to reach the entombed
workmen. j .
NEW YORK, Oct. IS.â Five men were
killed and two injured to-day when an
enormous mass of rock caved from the
side and roof of the Rapid Transit tunnel,
in course of construction on Broadway
about the line of 164th street The dead:

The explosion was heard at the Cen
tral police station, which Is a few. blocks
away: < .
Sergeant Donovan and a posse of offi
cers were at once dispatched to the
scene, and after interviewing the propri
etor of the store, came to the conclusion
that the dastardly work had been done
by highbinders. * . _
Some time ago Wong You. claimed that
his safe had been rifled by two polict
men, who were then attached to the
Chinatown squad. After an investigation
the officers were acquitted by the Police
Commissioners, who were satisfied that
they were innocent of the charge.
According to Wong You several high
binders since then have repeatedly
threatened to kill him, but for what rea
son he does not know. At the time of
the explosion he and two of his assist
ants were in the store.
Wong You was knocked down by the
force â¢ of ' the explosion, but quickly \u25a0 re
covering his feet, he procured a revolver
and went in search of the men who were
responsible for the dastardly deed. He
says he knows who the miscreants are,
and to-day he Intends to swear out war
rants for their arrest. . :
'A desperate attempt was made at-mid
night hist night to blow up the merchan
dise store of Wong You, at 1021 Dupont
street. Several enemies of the proprietor
placed a can of powder under the window
on the Baker alley side of the 'store and
then set a fire to a fuse leading to it.. In
an Instant there was a loud explosion,
at least a. half-dozen Chinamen, who
were in the alley, being knocked down by
the concussion. Special Officer George
Downey, who was only a short distance
away, ran to the. scene, but failed to get
a trace of the men who caused the explo
sion.
An examination of the store disclosed
the fact that the explosion had torn a
large hole, sufficient to admit â¢ a man's
body, in the side wall and I partially
wrecked . the interior. Several panes of
glass in a store on the opposite side of
the alley were also broken by. the concus
sion. " . . \u25a0 "S-.V*""* i*

Whether or not O'Donnell's name will
be placed on the ticket 'will -be decided by
Judge Seawell this morning. '
Dr. C. C. O'Donnelll stands a Very poor
chance of .having his name as an inde
pendent candidate for Mayor placed* on
the ballots to be used at the coming elec
tion if the testimony given by Registrar
Walsh and Deputy Registrar Zemansky
yesterday before Judge Seawell is. aa
strong as It appears. .
The Board of Election Commissioners
refused to place- 0*DonneH's name upon
the; ticket on the ground that he had not
a sufficient number of signatures on his
petition to be placed thereon. O'Donnell
forthwith sued for a writ of mandate,
compelling the board to give his name a
place on the ticket. 1
The reports of the 'clerks in the Regis
trar's office were read in court yesterday
by Zemansky, - and they â¢ showed that
O'Donnell's petition contained the
names of only 1282 electors, instead
of the 1955 names required by
law. The petition consisted of eleven vol
umes, and In each the report showed that,
while the number of names was large
enough, a number of the signers were not
registered and therefore were not qual
ified voters.; While Zemansky was read
ing over, the' petitions he discovered that
since leaving the Registrar's office they
had been tampered with. It was learned
that Dr. O'Donnell had taken the books
from the courtroom â¢ and ". endeavored to
strengthen his case by adding his name
to three of the books in places where he
had failed to do so. â¢
Dr. (yDonnelFs Fate.
Many of the clerks in the City Hall,
who believe that the law of self preserva
tion should be carefully observed in elec
tion times, have made up a ticket for
themselves. They are advocating Tobin
for Mayor, Lackmann for Sheriff, Mahony.
for County â¢ Clerk . and the Democratic
nominees for Supervisors.
The LJquor Dealers' Association will not
take definite action before October 24. It
is yet an open question whether there will
be any indorsement for Mayor. General
inquiry along the line of wholesalers 'and
retailers establishes the belief that the
contest for indorsement will at once nar
row down to Tobfn and Schmitz. Ten
days ago many of the liquor dealers, if
not really all who are identified with the
protective organizations, were confident
that Schmitz would be indorsed, but
since that time a change of sentiment has
taken place. They concede that Tobin
stock is going up and that they might find
themselves in an awkward position if they
declared against him. Conservative and
far seeing merchants in this line of traf
fic are advising against the indorsement
of any nominee for Mayor.
The Republicans will hold a ratification
meeting at Metropolitan Temple this
evening. All the candidates are expected
to be present. Asa R. Wells, the nominee
for Mayor, will probably speak at some
length in explaining the policy , he will
endeavor to pursue in the event of his
election. , . .
Clerks Make Up Ticket.
Thomas P. Riordan, chairman of . the
late Republican convention, is somewhat
disgusted and demoralized. At one time
he was willing to pay $5C0 out of his own
pocket if Wells. would get off the ticket.
Riordan's disgust is not limited to the
head of the ticket. At last accounts he
was . circulating the cards of P. Boland,
Democratic nominee for Public Admin
istrator. This action Is remarkable, as
John Farnham's nomination by the Re
publicans is generally applauded as one
of the best selections made by the con
vention. Riordan's open- defection adds
to the confusion and distress in the camp.
points secret meetings with no
torious bosses and then requests 1 the
newspaper reporters to make no^mention
of the fact that the bosses were present.
The result of his weakness and indecision
is demoralization in the ranks of his
would-be supporters. Other candidates on
the ticket are breaking away and striking
out for themselves.
The candidates have little confidence in
the campaign committee of which Max
Goldberg is the chief manager. It is true
that assessments according to agreement
are being paid in and there must be a
considerable sum of money in the com
mittee's possession at this time. -The
nominees, apprehending that the money
already collected may not be expended to
their advantage are making-independent
arrangements to win the favor of voter.5.
Some money is to be put in to help
Wells. It is hoped by such means that
the bad effect of his "confidential" talks
may be counteracted. The management
of Wells' campaign is to be entrusted to
ex-Assemblyman W. H. Cobb, who is a
candidate for Supervisor on the Republi
can ticket. Rooms on the second floo- of
the Grand Hotel have been engaged for the
use of Mr. Cob and his assistant; Jacob
Steppacher. Everything possible will be
done by these managers to place Wells in
a creditable light before the voters. \u25a0: He
will be advised to say nothing to-news
paper men or others regarding his privnte
conferences with Goldberg, Burns .and
Herrin. â¢

thoroughly disgusted over the

for Mayor on their ticket. He ap-

CHARLES KAISER KILLED
BY FALLING FROM WINDOW.
Tragic Death of Superintendent of
the Water and Electric Works :
of Reno.
Charles Kaiser, superintendent of the
water and electric works at Reno. Ne
vada, was accidentally killed yesterday
morning by falling out. of a third-story
window of the lodging-house at 703 Sutter
street. Mr "Kaiser was 70 years old and
very feeble on account of sickness. He
had been subject to dizziness and faint
ing spells for a long time; and less than
two weeks ago came to this city; with his
wife and son on the way to Santa Bar
bara for the benefit of his health. Not
improving there as fast as he had expect
ed he returned to this city, intending to
proceed to his home in Reno.
After having dressed himself yesterday
morning, and while his wife and son -were
in the room, he walked to the window and
fell out of it, striking on the sidewalk.
The testimony taken at the Coroner'3
Inquest yesterday convinced the jury that
Mr. Kaiser had been taken with an attack
of vertigo, which caused him to fall. A
verdict of accident, was returned..

MISS HARRIET JOSEPHIXE
HASSEXMUL.L.ER is another
fair California girl to be added
to the list of those who have
gone East to study and have
come back home covered with honors.
Miss Hassenmuller has just returned
after a six months', course in one of the
finest schools of elocution In the Empire
City. She graduated with highest honors,
and although the metropolis made her all
sorts of tempting offers to- remain she
felt she must come home to show her
friends what she can do.
Miss Hassenmuller has studied elocu
tion because of her inborn love for it. Al
though extremely talented, she does not
intend to go upon the stage. She will,
however, appear at some of the swell
charity affairs of the winter.
He spent the entire afternoon talking In
support of the latest move of the lawyers
for Mrs. Craven and at 5 o'clock Judge
Troutt continued the case until Monday
at 2 p. m. . .
Mrs. Craven appeared In the courtroom
attired in black. She appeared -to be in
good health and gave no evidence of the
strain to \u25a0 which she has been subjected
for the last few years.
Maguire reviewed the proceedings of the
former trial in. his arguments, going over
the case in a thorough manner and ad
vancing many points in favor of his mo
tion.
That document had no connection with the
case. Mrs. Craven had no interest in the docu
ment, which did not make her a devisee or
legatee in any manner. It . was . introduced
solely because it was found in her possession,
and it was introduced only that it might be
proven false. â¢ â¢ / .
Maguire also laid particular stress upon
the introduction of the lead pencil will as
evidence ] during the trial of the famous
case. He said:
Mrs. Craven's new counsel then made
his motion for a new trial of the suit to
quiet title to the properties on Mission
street and Pine street. Maguire moved
for a new trial on the following grounds:
Insufficiency of evidence; that the decision
of the court and judgment is against law;
errors in law, irregularity in proceedings
and newly discovered evidence.
In support of his plea that the decision
of the court and the judgment were
against law he said:
The decision was against the law because
the suit was commenced by the special ad
ministrators. The law does not devolve upon
them the power to commence suits or action to
quiet title. The function of a special adminis
trator is to take possession of and hold the
property during the probating of the wllL
Their duties are to care for and preserve the
property and not to enter into suits to quiet
title.
The affidavit filed by Mrs. Craven, stat
ing that Judge Troutt was biased is
founded on the belief that in passing
judgment upon her suit for a family al
lowance from the Fair estate he formed
and expressed an opinion prejudicial to
her interests and that therefore he could
not treat the testimony offered in sup
port of the motion for a new trial of the
case decided by Judge Slack four years
ago in an impartial manner.
An exception was taken by Maguire to
the ruling of the court on the charge of
prejudice and he asked for ten days to
prepare a bill of exceptions.
Judge Troutt has refused to grant the
motion of Mrs. Nettie R. Craven, for a
transfer of her cases against the Fair es
tate to some other department of the Su
perior Court of this county. Judge Troutt
denied the motion for a transfer yester
day, after listening to the reading of an
affidavit of prejudice by Judge James G.
Magulre, attorney for Mrs. Craven, just
previous to his making a motion for a
new trial.
Judge Troutt Will Hear the
Case Despite Affidavit
of Prejudice.
