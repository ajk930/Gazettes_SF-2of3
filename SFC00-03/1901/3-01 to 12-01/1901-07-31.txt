HE meeting: of the Steamship
1 1 Managers' Association held^ ye3
|| terday afternoon was largely at-
JJL tended by those vitally interested
in the actions of the men called
out at the meeting of the City. Front Fed
eration Monday night. The managers of
the various lines running in and out of
this port, as employers of fully one-half
the men affected by the order of the as
sociation of labor unions, talked long and
earnestly on the situation, and the trend
pf each speaker's remarks showed that
the managers would do everything In
their power to secure an amicable settle
ment of the conflict now raging between
the men of capital and the brawny son3
of toil.
The meeting- -was a general one and -was
called for the purpose of enabling tho
managers to thoroughly canvass the situ
ation. A resolution was adopted by tha
body expressing confidence in the board
of directors and the executive committee
of the association and authorizing them to
act as they saw fit.
The managers of the various lines of
steamers reported that there la a fairly
good prospect of getting all the vessels
scheduled to sail this week out on time.
All of the men employed did not go out
yesterday morning. With the aid of those
who remained faithful to their employers
and the crews of the vessels, many mem
bers of '.which are not union men. the
steamship men state that they will be
able to handle all the freight hauled ta
the wharf.
They contend that the men who walked
out on orders from the association quit
their work mainly by reason of the en
thusnasm which the general strike spiric
has developed. This enthusiasm, say the
shipping men. will soon be lessened. anJ
as their enthusiasm wanes they will be
come more amenable to the arguments
and evidences of a desire to conciliate
matters, which will be put forth by tha
water front men.
Many of the" members of the associa
tion told at the meeting yesterday of the
sorrow evinced by many of the men or
dered out over the* fact that they were
compelled to take part in the strike. A3
stanch union men they could do nothing
else, ard gave their support to the strik
ers and locked-out men mainly because
of their affiliation with kindred bodies.
, The shipping men are of the opinion
that the situation, though very serious,
will not cause the hardship along the
front that is expected. There are plenty
of laboring men to be had to take the
1 places of the strikers. They admit they
are greatly Inconvenienced by reason of
the . fact that the breaking in of green
hands necessitates considerable expense
and loss of time.
The members of the association claim
that they have the situation thoroughly
in hand and will be able to transact their
immense shipping business without 'delay.
They have formulated several plans for
the settlement of the difficulty, but will
not put them in action until the strike de
velops.
They have placed.no ban upon the men
who quit yesterday morning. On the con
trary, they are perfectly willing to havo
the longshoremen return to work, but un
der conditions at present existing.
ENGINEERS KEMEMBEBED.
Given Bonus of Month's Salary for
Faithful Service.
On her last trip to Honqjulu something
went wrong with the boiler tubes of tho
Oceanic Steamship Company's Zealandia.
Owing to the strike in the islands*, the
boiler-makers would not make the re
pairs, so Chief Engineer KelJar and hi3
men had to do the best they could. The
steamship was fixed up as well as possible
under the circumstances and a start was
made for San Francisco. "When twenty
four hours out the tubes began to lea'c
again, so Captain Dowdell put back to
Honolulu, where Chief Kellar and his
men worked night and day until a goo-i
job had been made, and the Zealandia
came home in good time and without a
mishap.
When John D. Spreckels, president of
the Oceanic Steamship Company, was told
of how faithfully the engineers and crew
had worked, he at -once ordered that each
man be given a bonus of a month's pay.
The following letter tells the rest of tha

SEATTLE, July 30.â Seattle is vitally
affected by the strike of the longshoremen
Â¦ and sailors which was ordered In San
Francisco this morning. As a result all
freight traffic between this city and the
California metropolis, which forms one
of the heaviest volumes of business- in
Seattle's marine traffic, is stopped entire
ly. The loss to this city and to the num
erous steamship companies operating be
tween here and San* Francisco will mean
thousands of dollars a month.
Seattle merchants are affected. similarly.
The, merchants here are already heavy
losers on account of the teamsters' strike
in San Francisco, and the local strike and
the sudden stoppage of supplies via tha ;
water route from California, greatly com
plicates the situation. â¢
Washington Port.
Sail Francisco Strike Means Loss to
filling the trays with cans for shipment.
This wholesale desertion of the men and
boys forced | the company to close down
the factory at noon. In all about 400
hands, 300 of whom are women and rlrls,
were thrown out of employment.
The America^ Can Company is the prin
cipal source of supply for the canneries
of the city and If within the next forty
eight hourB the factory js not able to re
sume operations, the canneries will be
compelled to close their doors, which
would mean th*t 6000 people would be de
prived of their employment. â¢ The serious
aspect of the situation may be partly ap
preciated when it is considÂ«red that the
raising havoc with the business of the
river- transportation companies plying be
tw&en San Francisco and Stockton. In
fact, the shipping businecs ls nearly para
lyzed both ways. Boats are still able to
deliver freight to the wharves in San
Francisco , and ' to vessels whose crewa
handle the goods. Coaling is done at
Pittsburg,' ao that as long as the supply
holds out the steamers are all right on
that score. The strike means a big loss
of business to the boat lines.
Business has fallen off greatly since tlie
strike and the general tie-up means a f Â»r
theT decrease. : It also brings a big loss
to the farmers who have shipped fruit to
San Francisco. The 'plums and pears on
the wharf are still in good condition, but
thousands of boxes of peaches have been
thrown Into the bay. The farmer not
only loses. the fruit, but has to pay the
freight. ' Af^

MEN WHO HAUL
SAND WILL GO
OUT ON STRIKE
When the meeting was called to order
the meeting hall was packed to its ut
most capacity. The greatest enthusiasm
Â¦prevailed among the teamsters. Secre
tary Rosenberg explained that the Labor
Council deemed- the strike necessary to
more effectively cripple the employers.
The- vote on the question of declaring a
sympathetic strike was unanimous. It
was decided to 'defer carrying the strike
into effect until Thursday morning, in
order that all the members of the union
might be notified and might act in con
cert. , Â¦Â¦
1 Secretary Rosenberg, after the meet
ing, stated that while the strike of the
sand teamsters will concern directly but
530 men. it will indirectly affect the* EOO0
men who are engaged in the building
trades o-f the city, and that during its ex
istence it would put an end to all build
ing construction. He also stated that the
men would go on strike with no en
mity toward their employers, for whom
they entertain the best of good feeling.
The officers of the union are as follows:
President, M. A. Longshore: vice president,
William Mills: financial secretary, P. Burke;
recording secretary, D. Burke; treasurer and
conductor, Walter Duryea: warden,- Patrick
Kelley; business manager, J. D. Harper- trus

orders when these are "contrary to law or
good morals or public policy." The point is
well made; but who, may we ask, ls to be
the Judge of these matters? The Employers'
Association by denyinr the right of its em
ployes to an equal voice in the terms of em
ployment, as It impliedly does, takes the posi
tion that it shall be the sole Judge In the
case. In & word, we are given to understand
that the terms "law," "good morals" and
"public policy" are synonymous with "good
business" for the Employers' Association
There can be no other understanding where
onÂ« party assumes the right to dictate to the
other.
With reference to the contention of the Em
ployers' Association that "they want -every
business to stand on Its own legs," we can
only say that Buch a contention is entirely
opposed to its own practices, to the very fact
Of Its own existence, and. Indeed, to every law
social and physical. What the Â¦ association
really means by this ls that it wants every
trades union to "stand on its own legs " Pre
sumably, it is only motives of policy that keep
it from saying that it wants every employe to
"etand on his own legs.;' Taking the actions
of the association together with its statements
we consider Its underlying desire ta be that
labor should remain divided in order that it
may be conquered.
There ls but one other point that we deem
night at 228 Eighth street and de
cided to go on a strike Thursday morning-.
The strike was declared purely in sym
pathy with the teamsters, who struck
rather than work for the Morton . Deliv
ery Company. The action was taken after
much deliberation and with the advice of
the San Francisco Labor Council, which
was represented at the meeting by Presi
dent W. H. Goff and Secretary Ed Ro
senberg.

THE American Can Company,
whose factory is at the corner of
Seventh and Townsend streets,
was among the first of the impor
tant manufacturing concerns to
directly feel the effects of the porters',
packers' and warehousemen's strike. The
seventy-five porters and packers who
were- employed by the company com
menced work as usual yesterday, but at
10:30 o'clock, after everything had been
prepared for the day's work, they all
walked out. Their action was followed
by about 150 boys who were employed in
worth noting- in the communication. Mayor
Phelan in his statement accompanying the
communication of the Employers' AESociatlon
quotes the latter as saying:
The employers on their part do not in
tend rand their organization refuses to ad
mit that they ever countenanced such ac
* tion) to refuse' to sell goods to any one'
who is solvent and able to pay for them:
that they will not refuse to sell goods to
any man who may have yielded to union Â¦
I demands. .
We have no hesitation In characterizing this
etatement as a deliberate falsehood. . Either it
ls that or the Employers' Association stands
convicted of ignorance of its own acts. The
present situation has beep brought about
mainly through the interference of the asso
ciation to compel employers who had no dis
pute with their employes to compel the Utter
to withdraw from their organizations. In
these cases the Employers' Association delib
erately contradicts its claim that it want*
every business to "stand on Its own legs." In
the cases of the wagon-makers, butchers, cooks
and waiters and others that might be men
tioned, in which the relations of employer and
employe were mutually satisfactory and har
monious, the association Issued its ultimatum
and compelled the employer, by threats of
shutting off his supplies, to sever these rela
tions and take sides with the . association in
the business of destroying the trade unions.
Taken as a whole and in detail we, see noth
ing in the statement and communication of
the Employers' Association that would Justify
any course other than active resistance to the
thinly disguised purpose of the association -to
deprive the workers of .their only means of
self-protection, the trade unions. . . Â¦.

STOCKTON" FEELS EFFECTS?
River Transportation Suffers From
Tie-TJp of Water Front;
STOCKTON, July 30.â The general tie
un on tha San Francisco water front la
and they and the non-union and amateur
teamsters made a pretty mess of many a'
dray load, but freight was moved and
orders were filled and a point was made
agsinst the strikers.
The most notably serious effect was in
the case of the American- Can Company,
which was compelled to close its doors,
throwing 400 persons out of employment.
Canneries dependent upon it for their sup-
Pjy of cans employ 5000 men, women and
children, and unless the factory can start
up again within a few. days they will all
be 'thrown out of employment.
Employers assert their confidence in the
ultimate collapse of the strike, though
many of them fear the struggle will be
prolonged. They say they will suffer any
loss to maintain their right to hire ca
pable employes, whether union men or
not.
The labor leaders are Just as confident
that the employers will soon grant con
cessions, now that they know the threats
of strike- were .not .mere:.'."blunV'- ,. They :
say their fight is to preserve to the work
ingmen the. right to organize. Tho life of
trade unionism in San Francisco, they
say, is at stake. s .
Though entering upon the contest with
moderation, the labor leaders hint that if
any attempt be made to bring in non
union firemen, sailors or longshoremen
from the outside the strike will be extend
ed to Include every port, on the coast. â¢
- Strikers' ', Credit Threatened.- - : r f
| Some consternation was caused by a re
port that the wholesalers had informed
the retailers of the city that after a stipu
lated time they must extend no credit to
strikers, but: must sell, to them for cash
only. . R. H.- Bennett Jr.. secretary for
the Associated Wholesale Grocers, and
M. F." Michael, attorney for the. Employ
ers'.Association, each denies that his.or
ganization has resorted or intended to" re
sort to the use of that kind of weapon '
: It is estimated. that more than 12,000-men
Quit work as a result of the Â» decision
reached Monday night by the City Front
Federation; That tho number did not
reach 15,000.* the approximate number of
members of the unions interested who
were employed when the strike was or
dered, was due to several causes. Some
of the marine firemen were notcalled out,
for special* reasons, and In some cases
large numbers of loyal members could not
be fiotifled. by ; the delegates. â¢ ,
canneries furnish means of livelihood for
a great portion' of the poorer class of the
city and if they are forced to shut down
many will be reduced almost to destitu
tion.
The factory, besides furnishing the great
er portion of the cane used in this city,
supplies about twenty-five canneries in
various parts of the State. It has a man
ufacturing capacity of 300,000 cans a day
and a shipping capacity of 1,000,000 cans.
Although the management of the com
pany was totally unprepared for the de
sertion of the porters and packers, an

Non-Union Substitutes Shoot
at Menacing . Crowd and
an Innocent Man Is Hit
OLD TEAMSTER
IS WOUNDED BY
NEGRO DRIVERS
P*ttpÂ«^HE first serious affray between
I the union and non-union teamsters
J .occurred yesterday morning about
Jl 7 o'clock at Eleventh and Harri
son streets, when Peter Lynch, a
striker, living at 351 Eleventh street, was
shot in the hip by either Roscoe Horn or
William Ferguson, colored men, employed
by G. W. Emmons & Co.
" Horn and Ferguson were on their way
to Emmons. & Co.'s barns to start work
for the day, when they were attacked by
a crowd of strikers who, they allege,
threw rocks and boards. Each pulled out
a revolver and commenced shooting. Horn
fired three shots, and Ferguson five be
fore the crowd fell back and allowed them
to reach the barns. One of the bullets
struck Lynch on the hip and he we"nt to
thÂ» Receiving Hospital, where- Dr. Millar,
after examining him, concluded that the
wound was not dangerous. The bullet
could not be located and the X-ray will
be called into requisition. Â¦
Horn and Ferguson were arrested at
the barns by Captain WIttman and Ser
geant Campbell and taken to the City
Prison, where they were booked on a
charge of assault to murder. Each is
about 24 years of age. They were re
leased on $100 cash ball each, put up by
Attorney Joseph Coffey, who represents
the Employers' Association. The bail was
accepted by Assistant .Warrant Clerk
Greeley. .
Horn claimed that he and Ferguson
were attacked Monday night by strikers
after they left the barns and they bought
the revolvers so as to be prepared for
trouble, as they had been threatened with
further chastisement if they attempted to
work yesterday morning. .
Speaking of the shooting, Ferguson said:
"As we passed Eleventh and Harrison
streets we saw a gang of men in a va
cant lot watching us. After we had passed
them they started after us, throwing
rocks and clubs. Just then another gang
came toward us and we were between the
two. We were struck several times, and
then when they made a combined rush
upon us I fired over their heads to fright
en them, but it had no effect and I fired
straight at them. Horn was shooting by
-this time, and the Â¦ mob - scattered. We
continued toward the barns, keeping our
revolvers leveled on the crowd. We had
a right to shoot, a3 our Jives were In dan
ger." , .......
Lynch is 62 years, of age and has. a fam
ily of seven children. He was, until the
strike, employed as a drayman by Bar
rett & Co., and is highly respected among
his neighbors. He said he was walking
across the street when he was shot. He
did not take part In the demonstration
against the "colored men. He declared
that the union pickets were not making
any disturbance- when the colored men
began to shoot.
Stephen O'Neill, who lives at 13S^ Silver
street, called at the Warrant Clerk's of
flco yesterday and asked for a warrant
for the arrest of Policeman O'Meara on
the charge of battery- It was not issued
O'Neill said he was on his way home yes
terday, morning and at Fourth and Silver
streets he stood for a moment among a
crowd of eight or ten men, whenthe offi
cer-came-with his Â¦ drawn clnb and or
dered them to move on. Before he could
get out of the way he was struck on the
forehead, ribs and arms by the officer's
club and had. to be taken to the Emer
gency Hospital to have his wounds and
bruises attended to.
James Ga-llaghcr, while driving 1 his own
team off Mission-street wharf, -was mis
taken by the strikers for a non^nlun
teamster and he was attacked and struck
over the head. He went to the Harbor
Hospital and had a lacerated wound
dressed. 'â¢Â¦Â¦â¢' ' â¢ â¢ . - . .-.-â¢...
Dan McKinney, a striking teamster

objected to RlcKlnney's plan and. in the
mixup the striker was struck on the head
with a club. McKinnev had his wounds
dressed at tho Harbor Hospital. :
Despite - the enormous reinforcements
that the army of strikers received yester

pyi-Â«^HE City Front â¢Federation met
II last evening and discussed ways
it and means of strengthening- the
Jt position taken by it the night be-
lore in the present labor difficul
ties. The resolution which called out the
members of the unions forming the fed-
eration was the main topic under dlscus
eion. According to many of the members
it did not- cover sufficient ground and
afforded the Employers' Association too
many chances to secure union labor with
out causing the men to break faith with
their unions.
The first radical change made in the
resolution added to the difficulties of the
shipowners. The original document af
fected only the "port of San Francisco,"
thereby making it possible for the own
ers of vessel* to secure the unloading: of
their cargoes by union hands at near
by j>orts. To prevent this the resolution
was changed to read so as to cover the
entire "bay of San Francisco."
Tho other changrss were of minor im
portance, such as changes in the phrase
ology, but they all tended to strengthen"
the position of tho strikers.
Tho delegates from the various unions
reported that In every instance the mem
bers of the unions they represented had
10 obey the orders cf the federation and
quit work. The men will commence to
register to-day, so that the federation
wlJl be able by to-night to know exactly
how many have quit work.
A resolution was presented and adopted
Framing permission to the members of
the Coal Teamsters' Union to haul coal to
the different newspapers, hospitals, asy
lums and charitable institutions. 1
President Casey of the City Front Fed
eration in an interview after the meet
ing said: "We only met to-night to per
fect our plans for the battle between the
laboring men and the Employers' Asso
ciation which is now on. The Teamsters'
Union is out to a man, and I do not think
there will be. any doubt of our soon being
able to report that every other union
affiliated with the teamsters will make
-.he same report. Everything- looks favor
ible to the teamsters' cause, which is now
:he cause of every union in the Federa-
Jon. We have carefully planned a cam
paign and we do not intend that it shall
>e a losing one."
There are 1200 members of the Pacific
Marine Firemen's Union out on
strike. There are 1500 members in the
union. The 300 men who remained at
Â¦work are tboee employed by GoodsJI, Per
kins & Co. and on the tugboats.
The firm of Goodall, Perkins & Co.
employs only union firemen and recog
nizes the Firemen's Union as a body. The
firm signed an agreement some time ago
to that effect and have always liVed up
to it, and for that reason the men em
ployed by them were not included among
those called out
The union determined to allow the fire
men working on the tugboats to remain
at their posts. To remove them would
place the vessels coming in and going out
of the harbor entirely at the mercy of
the elements and endanger the lives of
hundreds of people. The tugs, therefore,
will be ready at any time during- the
strike to speed to the assistance of any
vessel which may get into difficulties,
either in or out of the harbor.
QUESTIONS AT ISSUE.
Federation Replies to Michael's Let
--" ter to Mayor.
The City Front Federation issued last'
(night the following additional statement
under the nead, "The Association's Posi
tion": ., ; .
ThÂ« communication submitted by the Em
1-loyers' Aseociation to the representatives of
the City Front Federation may mean anything
or nothing, according tÂ» the point of view. It
is a document the meaning of which can be
gathered only by experiment*and demonstra
tion. The experiment made with it â¢ imme
diately upon its receipt proved that it
nothing at all eo far as the labor organizations
are concerned.
â¢In the proposals of the City Front Federa
tion ft was distinctly stated that as a neces
sary step to the re-establlehment of peace, the
employers should establish the "status quo
ante." That is to say. It was proposed that'
all hands should go back to the condition thst
existed prior to the rupture between the Dray- .
men's Association and the Brotherhood- of
Teamsters, the idea, of course, being: that then
the terms of agreement between the two or
ganizatlons might be peaceably reviewed and,
where necessary, readjusted. While the re
ply of the Employers' Association does not di
rectly intimate acquiescence in this proposal,
the fact that it was submitted at all seemed '
to Justify a construction favorable thereto. !
Consequently, and In order to test the real :
meaning of the document. Mr. Casey, of the
Brotherhood of Teamsters, immediately pre
rented a cony of the communication to Mr.
McNab of .McXtb & Smith, with a request
for his views upon it. Mr. McNab was asked
if, so far as the Draymen's Association was
concerned, the reply of the Employers' Asso
ciation would be construed as establishing the
status quo ante. Mr. MeXab replied that he
Cia not know; that he knew nothing about the
matter. Thus, when put to the only, and the
best test, possible, the communication of the
Employers' Association was found to be merely
b. mass of words having: no significance what
ever that could be considered as the basis of
further negotiations.
A perusal of the document Issued by the
Employers' Association shows that tt contains
a great deal of generalization and absolutely
no real nubstance. So far as any real mean
lnir can be gathered from it. It is simply a
declaration that the employers propose to con
tinue In their policy of Ignoring the right of
their employes to stipulate and make good
through the power of organization, the terms
cf employment. Such Js the only meaning that
can be gathered from the declaration that the
employes roust "faithfully obey all Instructions
and orders of thÂ»lr employers." Considering
the fact that the trades unUms have never ques
tioned the right of the employer to instruct
and order his employes In any matter con
cerning the Interests of the former, the state
ment mentioned is susceptible of but one eon
etruction. namely, that the employe Is re
quired to "faithfully obey all instructions and
orders" in matters that are properly the con
cern of the employe himself.
In other words, we construe the requirement
cf the Employers' Association to be that the
employe mvrt work ae long and for as little
pay as the employer may see fit to give him
or her. ' : ' 4 â¢< ~
We note that the Employers' Association
makes the reservation that it shall not re-
Quire faithful obedience to its instructions and

ECHLEY PREPARING FOR COURT.
A letter has been received at the Navy
Department from- Admiral Klmberly
risking to be excused 'from the Schley
court of inquiry on ncount of the state of
his health. Tho admiral is understood to
be Buffcrlnpr from heart trouble. The ap
plication wns placed in the hands of Sec
retary Long, who will dispose of the mat
ter from his home in Bingham, Mass.
John R. dos Prssob hast been named as
the probnble ehief counHel for Schley
Commander, John E. . Plllsbury will act

asked whether he did not make the state
ment in a magazine article that he was
informed the Spanish cruisers would leave
Curacao for Santiago. If Rear Admiral
Sampson replies in the. affirmative, as he
is expected -to do, the attention of the
court will then be called to the fact that
the commander in chief, with a formida
ble squadron, was on May 15 at Capa
Haytien, Haytl. the day on which Ad
miral Cervera left Curacao far Suntiago.
The admiral will be asked why he did
not go directly to Santiago, where i he
could have intercepted the Spanish fleet
before It entered the harbor on May 12.
Regarding the character of the blockade
that was made by Commodore Schley. nt
tentlon will be called to the size o"f tho
squadron which he commanded. Schley
had six vessels, and it was advisable If ho
wero to- be In condition- to defeat the
enemy that he should keep his squadron
well together.
This, It is contended., was the reason
why he nlwnys retained It In squadron
formation. and why he retired a short dis
tance nt night from the harbor.
. Admiral Sampson stated that the log of
tho Brooklyn shows that the squadron
was at night twenty-eight miles to the
southward of Santlapo. , The loir of the
Brooklyn will bo produced to show that
this is not the case.
With respect to the propriety of Rear
Admiral Schley's action In determining to
return to Key West for coal it will be
contended that Rear Admiral Sampson's
conduct was equally tut culpRble, if any
Rear Admiral Schley. on the other hand,
carrying >fcut the department's instruction
to ascertain whether the Spanish fleet
was In the harbor, made a reconnoissance
on the afternoon of May 31 "to develop
fortifications, with their character. The
reconnoissance was intended to injure and
destroy the Colon, the reconnoissance de
veloping satisfactorily the presence of the
Spanish squadron lying behind the island
near the inner forts, as three fired over
the hill at random." â
Rear Admiral Sampson, who arrived at
Santiago about 6 o'clock on the morning
of June 1. had four hours and twenty min
utes in which to attack the Colon and
Vizcaya. He failed, however, to fire a
single shot at them.

(I . "If Rear Admiral Schley were
guilty of a dereliction of duty in
failing to destroy the Cristobal^
Colon as she lay in the mouth of the har- ,
bor of Santiago de Cuba, then Rear Ad
miral Sampson was likewise guilty of the
same charge."
This will be one of the strongest points
which will be submitted to the court of
inquiry in behalf of Rear Admiral Schley.
In his complete report of operations un
der his command. Rear Admiral Sampson
states that immediately on arriving at
Santiago, "I steamed down past the en- ,
trance to Santiago harbor and "saw lying
close within the Cristobal Colon and one
of the Vizcaya class. Both of these got
up steam and moved up into the harbor
out of sight."
It is contended by friends of Rear Ad
miral Schley that this statement lndl-,
, cates that the Spanish ships immediately
hauled up and steamed back into the har
bor. As a matter of fact, they did not
leave their anchorage for four hours and
thirty-five minutes.

Secretary Williams paid matters were in
such a enr^ition that nothing could be
made public.
At the close of the day's session the
members of the board slipped avray one
by one to their respective homes until no
one was left at headquarters but Presi
dent Shaffer and Secretary Williams.
They at first refused to give any informa
tion, but Shaffer volunteered the state
ment that an adjournment had been taken
until to-morrow. Further than this he
r.-ould say nothinp. and admitted that
even the announcement of adjournment
was mere tban he should have said.
At the afternoon meeting of the board
all were present who had taken part dur
ing the early session, with the exception
of Garland. Soon after the session began
C. W. Bray, chief engineer of the Ameri
can Tin Plate Company and one of the
former conferees for the manufacturers,
called at the offices. President Shaffer
was called from the room and held a five
minute conversation with him in the hall
and then returned to the meeting, while
Bray left the building. The conference
between these two men was apparently of
a. friendly character and indicated that
there was at least no strained feeling
there.
During the intermission representatives
of the association were in communication
with New York over tne long-distance
telephone.
Will Hold Another Conference.
Secretary Williams read his report of
the conference and also the propositions
that had been made bv the officials of the
l"nited States Steel Corporation. The dis
cussion that followed continued until after
the noon hour and then the meeting ad
journed until VSt o'clock.
It is doubtful if the members of the
general executive board of the Amalga
mated Association were ever more un
communicative and reserved than during
and after the meeting which was held to
day. The full board \vaÂ«= present with the
exception cf National Trustee John.
Pierce, who was away on official business.
The members gathered at the. general
offices of the Amalgamated Association
early in the morning and at 9:30 o'clock
were called to order by President Shaf
fer. Those present, in addition to the of
ticlsls of the board, were Joseph Bishop,
former president of the association and
now a member of the Ohio board of ar
bitration, and il. M. Garland, also an ex
president of the organization. When the
meeting was opened all but the conferees
were requested to leave the room. The
discussion started after President Shaffer
had gone over the details of the confer
ence he had had with Morgan and Presi
dent Schwab in New York.
All i? conjecture, however, as it is im
possible to get any definite statement as
to the day's conference from any of the
persons interested. When the board dis
persed, at 6:30. every member was way
laid by persistent newspaper men seek
ing information, but every question was
answered by tht stereotyped phrase: "We
can say nothing. There is absolutely
nothing to give to the public at this
time."*
Conferees Are Setieent.
The protracted session indicates that
the beard is not satisfied with the pro
visions of the compromise measure and
unloss some modifications are made its
ratification is doubtful. The opening of
union mills to ncn-union workmen is the
point on which it is believed the board
hesitates, and the long-distance telephone
between New York and Pittsburg was
worked frequently to-day to get a modi
lioalion of this clause. The workmen
hoM -. hat this would grlve the mill owners
full opportunity to crush the union work
iTien without a strike, by finding excuses
to discharge union men and then fill their
places with non-unionists. Another rock
of dissension is said to be the retention
in their present jobs of the men who
worked as "strike breakers" at the va
rious mil'.s during the strike. It Is said
that these men have been promised the
protection of the manufacturers in case
of a settlement and that the mill owners
will not concede their dismissal at the
request of the organization. The work
ers, it is said, are willing to declare the
mills now working non-union open mills,
but strenuously object to having all the
mill? of the combination classified as open
mills.

When the conference opened to-day It
was confidently expected that an agree
ment would be reached in a short time,
but after a session lasting from 9:30 a. m.
until 6:30 p. m. the meeting adjourned
without arriving at any conclusion, so far
as known, to meet again to-morrcw morn

a suit to oust him from office because he
left the State on April 3 and was absent
fifteen days without obtaining permission,
it Is alleged, from the Board of Supervis
ors. A petition to file a quo-warranto suit
to accomplish this has been filed with At
torney General Tlrey I... Ford by T. D.
Livingston of this county through Attor
ney F. C. Scherrer. The petition seta forth
that on April 3 last Stern made a trip to
Seattle without first obtaining permission
to leave the State, and because of this
be has since usurped and unlawfully held
the office of Supervisor in the Third dis
trict. The petition asks that Stern be
ousted and the office be declared vacant.
- Supervisor Stern, through Attorney S.
F. Leib, has filed an answer In which he
practically admits the facts set forth, but
states he told the other members of the
board he intended to make the trip and
they made no objection. No resolution
granting Stern permission to leave the
State was passed, and ne sets forth in the
answer that he could have had such a res
olution passed had he asked it. It is also
held ' the law does not state how such
permission shall be granted.

SAN JOSE, July 20.â Supervisor Fred M.
Stern of this county id confronted with
Baptists. '
SANTA CRUg,. July 3O.-Much interest
was excited at the Christian convention
in Garfisld Park to-day over suggestions
made by a committee, from the Baptist
Assembly, conaisUng of the Rev. A. P.
Banks of Sacramento, the Rev. J. Brown
of Fresno and the Rev. J. A. Coombs.
The committee brought a greeting from
the Baptist convention. Dr. Banks em
phasized the growing tendency toward a
union between the Baptists and the Dis
ciples. The report states that the time
is almost at hand, if not now here, when
the brotherly love they bear to each other
should be shown in some more tangible
and substantial way Â¦ than by annual
greetings. Then follows:
"We would commend to your earnest
attention that in many small villages
where there is only room for one small
church of our belief, both the Christians
and Baptists exist as rivals. Is there not
some plan which we could agree upon by
which -we could unite our forces in these
fields and avoid all such useless duplica
tion of church plants in the future by a
system of comity and local union?"
The Â¦ report was received with enthusi
asm. A committee was appointed by the
Christian convention to confer with the
Baptist committee to agree upon some
plan in accordance with suggestions.

E. C." Starks, are making an Investigation
of the. local seal rookeries for the Gov
ernnTent, .which may add volumes to the
present knowledge of seals and the In
dustry of sealing.
For some weaks they have been engaged
in, visiting the rookeries of San Miguel
and Santa Cruz Islands, two of the is
land chain which bounds the Santa Bar
bara Channel. It has been held that the
seals /were destroyers of edible fish and
for this reason fishermen have regarded
them as their enemy. In former times
all .these -channel islands were inhabited
by thousands of seals, but the ravages. of
the hunters have thinned them out until
only a few rockeries remain. Hunters
have been allowed to enter the rookeries
at breeding- time and wantonly kill them.
The species -which inhabit this coast, have
a value of only* about 75 cents per skin
to the hunters, so that to make wages
the. slaughter, must be wholesale. Sea
lions . have also been destroyed.
The work of the Stanfond men has been
to ascertain whether. the seals were flsh
eaters. . For this purpose they chartered
a schooner under Captain Vasquez of this
port. They did not confine their search
to one locality, but took seals from every
part of the island where they are found.
On their first voyage sixty-three were
captured' and killed for examination of
their stomachs. Out of the slxty-threa
only three were found to contain edible
fish. .There were, devil fish, squid and
shell fish; discerned by microscopic analy
sis,.in the stomachs of the seals, but oth
er kinds were not there. This was taken
as a proof that the seal is not an enemy
but a friend to the fisherman. In the
stomach of one huge bull seal were found
fifteen pieces of rock, each larger than a
hen's epg.
The Stanford men sailed to-dav for the
lower end of Anacapa island, the farth
est island southeast In the chain. They
will return here for supplies on Monday.

THE Kosmoa liner Anubis arrived
from Hamburg, via . South and
Central American ports, yester^
day. She brought up sixteen cabin
passengers,, two second cabin pas
sengers, and one In the steerage. Off the
River riatte the Anubis was caught in a
pampero, and for three days a â¢ storm
raged that tested the qualities of the ship
to tho utmost. A quantity of wreckage
was passed, and 1 Captain Behrmann ex
pected: to hear of a disaster at Valpa
raiso. Upon arriving: at that port he
learned of the abandonment of the flve
masted French bark France! and later
met her master. The France was bound
from Newcastle-on-Tyne for Valparaiso
with a cargo of coal and was caught in
the same storm as the Anubis,
Some of the spars were carried away and
the vessel was thrown on her beam ends.
All the masts were cut away in an at
tempt to get her on an oven keel, but it
fulled. Tho crew consequently abandoned
the France and later were picked up by. a
passing' steamer and taken to Monte
video. The France was last seen on May
13 in latitude 32 degrees 22 minutes south,
longitude 59 degrees 27 minutes west. She
was ono of the tho largest sailing vessels
afloat, being 8942 tons burden, 361 feet long,
48 feet 8 Inches beam, and 25 feet 0 Inches
deep.
The cabin passengers on tho Anubis
were the following named:
From Callnoâ Arthur Hansen and wife, San
Joae de Guatemala: Roberto Cabrera, Mazat
lan; Eugene BchmttU, wlfo and threo children;
Juan du FrÂ»sne and wife. F. Rivers, Jose Blu
Inguanzo, Eladlo de la Rocha and sister and
Pedro Echesruren.
The Anubis will take on a general cargo
besides 1000" tons of barley and 1000 tons
of flour for South nnd Central America.

After a delay of two hours the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company succeeded in
getting the Walla Walla away for Puget
Sound. The strikers informed the com
pany that this would be the last vessel
they would get away until after the ter
mination of the strike. Captain Wallace,
superintendent of the company, says it
has an agreement with the firemen for a
year, which has yet ten months to run.
He says the firemen have agreed to stand
by that agreement. Outsiders say they
will go back on the agreement and that
there will be a general tie-up of the com
pany's vessels. Captain Wallace is san
guine there will be no tie-up. He stated
yesterday that ho would use every effort

udmltted to him that the men were more
than satisfied with the treatment they hal
received, but were compellod to leave the
vessel through sympathy with the other
unions. Mr. Spreckels asked the dele
gates whether the food he furnished the
men was not better than tho regulations
called for, and they said it was. He then
informed them that the action In taking
men off his ships simply had a tendency
to drive men like himself Into Joining the
Employers' Association. Ho said he was
perfectly satisfied with the men and stat
ed that they had been in his employ for
many years. He said he could not see
where the fairness came In when they
wanted to do him an Injury simply out of
sympathy for other men.
The .Spreckels tugboats are still run

The situation at tho headquarters of the
Porters. Packers and Warehousemen' Â¦
T T nlon at 109 California street was fraught
â¢with significant Intercut to the hundreds
of strikers who thronped tho place
throughout the day. President John
O'Neill was on hand constantly with
Â¦words of encouragement for every strik
ing delegation that arrived from hour to
hour. The reports from tho various firms
and warehouses affected were most en
couragltiR to the (strikers, all of whom ex
pressed the opinion that of the 2000 mem
ber, of the union less than fifty would
decline to walk out.
At 2 o'clock nearly C00 members of the
union had registered at headquarters.
Only those were allowed to register who
had talked out In response to orders re
ceived from the union. Fifty pickets
were sent out durlnsr the day to secure
recruits from the ranks of the members
who wavered, and of these pickets few
reported that their efforts were fruitless.
In several Instances the men were not al
lowed to enter places of business to talk
to the toiler*, but the preater number wero
reached durinjr tho noon hour and tho slt
tyitlon explained to them. . Tho result was
a steady Increase of the ranks of strikers.
At noon it was reported that all of the
â¢warehousemen belonging; to the union,
with the exception of those employed by
th<> Haslett Warehouse Company, had
walked out and that of the twenty-nine
warehouses of that corporation less than
Bix wer*> open for business. At 2 o'clock
the pickets reported that the Pacific Can

had closed down, owing to the walkout
of fifty men, not Including an army of
boys and slrls. In this instance) many
non-union men "went on strike with their

well until the prospect of a strike loomed up
on Paturdsy. Then the men asked us if they

to do as they wished. The result was that
every man renlgned. Hence when the order to
strike was Issued It did not affect the men

great inconvenience to us in that It Interferes
with our shipping facilities. If we cannot ship

ground that thev belonged to the union, but
because we could not employ men In whom we

well fatl*fled with their treatment at our
hands and none of them will walk out of
positions which they may hold durlnar their

The future of tho,Btrlke In Oakland rests

conditions here are practically controlled
from tho other side of the bay, although
tho local Brotherhood of Teamsters has
full authority to take such independent
notion as Its members shall consider to
be best.

considerable inconvenience to tho shop
keepers who have orders unfilled In San
Francisco houses. With the walkout of
this morning the transfer companies
which handle the bulk of this buslneHB
have given notice that thoy will center
their efforts upon the handling of crosH

Now the companies maintain that they

The direct effect of the local strike has
been to render the freighting of merchan

their full service on account of the walk

The sun came up out of the ocean In a
splendor that he seems to assume only in

OAKLAND, July 30.â Two hundred
teamsters and helpers employed by the
various express companies engaged in
trans-bay freighting went on strike this
morning, in accordance with the action
taken in San Francisco. These 200 men
comprise about one-third the membership
of the local Brotherhood of Teamsters.
The draylng firms whoso business is con
nned to hauling within the limits of this
city and the merchants who handle local
traftlc only have not been afftcted by tho
strike. So far as their teamsters are con

Company on this side of tho bay took
charge of the two teams they had in ser

team- all day and handled such freight
from San Francisco as the limited facili
ties enabled the company to move.
No suggestion of disorder was mani

tempt to Interfere with any of tho men
who were handling their own teams.
There were some mutterlngs about the
headquarters of the strikers with regard
to the Austin Freight and Transportation
Company which put threo teams at work
this morning with non-union crews. Three
policemen, Keefe. Jacobus and Brannan,
were detailed to guard the drivers, tho

Rev. Father John A. Lally of All

Father Lally, like the rest of those who
made the trip, was delignted with the ex

much valuable information regarding the
islands he visited.
"It was one of the most pleasant trips
one could ever hope to take," said Father
Lally. "The passengers actually hated to

had been such a pleasant home to them.
Going and coming the weather was par

Once the leading industry related to the soil, there
arc some startling indications that it is permanently
declining in this State. While it may not yet be- called
a dying industry, it is evidently at a standstill, if not
retrograding. This is said from no pessimistic mo
tive. Nothing is more* common in 'the history Â¦â¢ â¢ of
American agriculture than the agony and bloody
sweat that go into the change of its crops by a'farmf
ing community. Louisiana underwent it, exchanging
indigo for sugar-cane, and parts of the wheat belt
of the Upper Mississippi Valley had 'to abandon that
crop and seed the fields it had impoverished to dairy
grasses and take up' butter and cheese. It is known
Â¦' v" . Â¦ Â¦ . ms Â¦ - . Â«Â¦ .Â¦
The answer of the railroad to their request was that
the reductions in wheat freights made in the last few
years were all that could be expected, and that if
there were any further reductions they would be all
taken up by advances in ocean freights. Deep-water
freight seems to be the pinching point. The num
ber of vessels in the wheat fleet has fallen off, having
been absorbed in the great increase of general ton
nage required in ocean traffic. It is believed, too,
that the introduction of oil as a fuel has affected wheat
as* to transportation,' because the demand for coal is
less, and the fleet that brought coal to carry away
wheat has decreased. Wheat feels all these adverse
influences and has ceased to be the profitable crop
that 'it was in the days of Dr. Glenn and his 6o,ooo
acre wheat. field.
But we did not intend to stray into the esthetic
and away from the practical features of this interest
ing traffic. There may be some reason why the farm
ers of the upper valley cannot in the same way com
bine and provide wheat barges and steamers to tow
them to Port Costa, or some other point where they
meet deep-water ships. If there he no other reason
except failure to take advantage of an opportunity,
the matter is worth examination.
It is somewhat surprising that the growers fail to
take advantage of the river. The farmers on the
delta lands of the Sacramento long ago promoted
their own line of boats, which ply regularly through
out the year bringing down fruit, vegetables, grain,
hay and what other produce they have for market.
Their lands are so situated that it is impossible to
ship by rail on any terms, so the land-owners joined
and provided their own transportation. The traffic is
most picturesque. When freight waits at a landing
a flag is hung out, just like an express call in the 'city,
and the boats zigzag up nrid down the stream in
making the stops on cither shore where they are
wanted. The stream is beautiful, its banks tropical in
the luxuriance of their foliage, and the cargo is aro
matic with the odors of fruit and melons.
A RECENT conference between the Sacramento
Valley wheat-growers and the Southern Pacific
Railway, though futile in effecting its object,
which was a reduction in freights, brought out some
interesting facts. ". Â»V;

J. J. McCarthy, president of the Iowa Bar Associ
ation, in a recent address at a meeting of that body
said: "One of long experience on the bench writes
me that in his opinion about one-half of all evidence
received on behalf of the defense of criminal cases is
false. Another judge of equally high repute writes
that he believes 75 per cent of the evidence offered in
divorce cases approaches deliberate perjury. Another
writes that perjury is committed in a majority of
important lawsuits and that the crime is rapidly
increasing." Either that js a very pessimistic view of

Between now and Saturday, when registration
doses, every effort should be made by all who are
in favor of honest politics, genuine Republicanism and
good government to see to it that every true and
stanch Republican who is entitled to registration
should get his name on the rolls. There are of course
many things in business affairs to distract the atten
tion of men from their political duties, but these
should not be permitted to lead any one to .neglect
the issue that is now before San Francisco. . If the
Republican party submits to boss rule at the primaries
it may bid farewell to any hope of carrying the city
when the municipal election takes place.
So many men have looked upon the primaries in the
past with distrust that some may be inclined to dis
trust them now. On the other hand, others may be
so sure that under the new law corruption will be
powerless that they will' not deem it worth while to
vote. It is these two elements that constitute the
danger of the" situation and gives the bosses their
only ground for expecting a victory. The bosses
know that primary elections have been neglected by
many good citizens in the past, and they i expect a
similar state of things this time. With a light vote
they can win. To defeat them there will be needed
a heavy vote. It is for good citizens to see to it that
the vote is heavy.
It is to be borne in mind that the primary elections
this. year will be quite different from those of "the
past. The old scenes of fraud and violence which dis
gusted honest men with such elections cannot be
repeated under the new law. If Kelly and Hcrrin win
out this time it will be only because they can bring
to the polls a number of rounders large enough -to
outvote the better elements of the party. Of course
that cannot be accomplished if good citizens attend
to their political duties. If there be a full registra
tion of all good citizens and a full vote on election
day, the end of boss rule in San Francisco will have
comei

FROM the Republican Primary League there has

REGISTER AT- OIJOE.
That mournful question has been promptly an
swered. Up from New York itself there have arisen
voices of protest. It is announced by some of them
that never was the banjo more musical or more popu
lar than now. It is not the banjo that is passing,
says one authority, but the old-fashioned way of
teaching" and playing. Another expert says: "I find
that true and capable' exponents of the banjo, .with
their good instruments, have more engagements at
the functions, of the Four Hundred than they can at
tend to." Such infoimation will bring a world of
comfort to the American public. The., banjo 'is our
only national musical instrument. It has been a joy
in the past, and may it live forever.
The New York Sun took up the theme and poured
forth' upon it a stream of words that expressed a
considerable amount of banjo lore in sentences whose
melancholy cadences sound like a funeral dirge. It
told how in 1848 Joe Sweeney, the minstrel, intro
duced the instrument to the New York public, how
it roused a "languid interest," how the gifted Sweeney
added the. E string, how Barnum took it up in 1858
and had banjo concerts at his museum, which were
followed by a flash of . popularity during the . war.
How banjo solos were for a time played at Wallack's
Theater between the acts, how the banjo artists threat
ened the supremacy of violinists and pianists, how in
1883 there' was a craze on the subject, and so on
down to the time when newspapers devoted columns
to banjo concerts. Then the Sun says: ."With the
original Spanish Students who appeared at Booth's
Theater came the mandolin, and its tremulous tinkle
marked the first jangle of the banjo's death knell.
The Students made a tour through the country and
the first wedge to knock out the banjo had been
driven in. And, alas! where is the banjo now?".
A SHORT time ago in commenting upon filing
a petition in bankruptcy; George C. Dobson, a
veteran banjoist in New York, declared that the
day of the banjo is over. He is reported to have said
the bicycle, the camera and golf have proven so at
tractive to the young they have no longer any time
for the banjo and that instrument as a pleasure maktr
is among the things of the past.

THE shipping industry of the city of Nome has been cn-
Vtirely revolutionized. Until May of this year all mer
chandise that was brought north by steamers was, land
ed on the beach. Steamers waited days and days and
.sometimes weeks for the Ice to break up before they
could unload their freight. -Va'.vY " ; Â¦ ââ¢'Â¦
The steamship Jeanie arrived ten miles from Nome on May
25 of this year. The residents of the far north city claimed
that the steamer would have to wait perhaps a month before
she would be able to land her passengers and freight. Bat the
vessel's master was not of the .waiting kind. He sent for dog
sleighs and unloaded his passengers and freight on the Ice ten
miles from the busy place. The scheme worked well, and In
the future all steamers will unload their freight on the ico
when possible, thus escaping the risk of spoiling their mer
chandise while crossing the breakers near the beach in, open
boats and lighters. The above picture was brought down from
Nome by J. J. Shaughnessy, the well known traveling man.
Â¦ THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE STEAMER JEANIE LANDING HER PASSENGERS AND DISCHARGING HER CAIU
GO ON THE' ICE SOME MILES FROM NOME. THE FREIGHT AND BAGGAGE WERE HAULED ASHORE
BY HORSE AND DOG TEAMS.
"Hast thou seen a dog bark at a beggar and the
wretch run from the cur? There was the image of
brief authority. Even a dog is obeyed in office."
There may b> cases in which it is less ignoble to
have a pull. One can imagine approaching by such
means an authority that has strength, if not dignity,
and therefore is entitled to some respect. But when,
as in this case, the authority approached has neither
strength nor dignity, but only an inflated sense of
power, it is like the king of beasts soliciting a flea
for permission to live in the jungle.
The schools are likely to suffer from the spirit of
intrigue and prejudice which the board inspires.
When it is notorious that the way in or the way out
for a teacher bears no relation to merit and worth,
experience and excellence, then the worthy must de
scend to the methods of the unworthy to get favor
and hold position, or go out carrying the sense of
gross injustice tempered only by having retained man
hood or womanhood by refusing to bow at the shrine
of upstart selfishness and parvenue authority.
We mention the lady and the personal phases of the
case only to illustrate the methods which are dis
turbing our schools. She is unknown to us, and her
case is interesting only as a type and her treatment
only as a symptom. â¢
It is hardly thinkable that members of a board
should not only work up a false case against such a
teacher, and prejudge while pretending to fairly try
it, but also accompany the rendering of. an unjust
judgment by personal taunts. The members of that
board might be ignorant of their duties, as most of
them are,. out of touch with the spirit of our public
schools, as some of them are, and by reason of in
firmity of temper, sordid prejudice, lack of judicial
mind unfit to sit in judgment, as they all are; but it
is too much to find them also wanting, in the human
ity that must inspire the character of man and
woman, else it is not gentle, no matter what the
length a pedigree may have.
: The lady had in early life by her own will and exer
tions prepared herself for her profession. Her inheri
tance was poverty, in a material sense, but in a higher
sense she inherited from her ancestry a firmness of
purpose and a genius for work that are better than es
tates and bank accounts. Her career for years was
distinguished by success of the most gratifying na
ture* and in spite of all the errors and / sometimes
crimes of school boards her high merit. held her in
the schools. I*-: ; . :
Finally her place so well filled was wanted by the
favorite of a millionaire, and under hxs imperious in
fluence she was transferred to the plafe where the
present board found her. and whence' it has expelled
her, unlawfully and irregularly. It is said ' that the
president of this board even taunted her that she had
sprung from the loins of labor, and therefore would
of course accept injustice and misfortune with a feel
ing less keen than if "gently reared." The daughter
of the people will probably accept whatever comes,
and she will as probably test the issue whether there
is justice in the courts and a defense against the snob
bery and lawlessness of this board.
SCHOOL POLITICS.
THE case of Miss McKcnzie, summarily and ir
regularly dismissed from \ the schools of this
city, may well cause alarm in all teachers who
are not in possession of a "pull."
But nowhere has the soil gone back to nature, or
farming ceased with the passing of wheat, nor will
this happen in California.
We know how hard it is to turn the practiced wheat
raiser away to other crops, but if the problem of
prices and freights prove : insoluble by any persua
sion the wheat-growers can bring to bear on the rail
roads or ship-owners, and they cannot use the river
as suggested, we see nothing in the future except a
change. It is useless to take a pessimistic view of
this necessity. It has" been upon the people of other
States, and has been manfully' met without harm to
the fortunes of individuals or injury to the prestige of
the commonwealth. Every part of the United States
that is_growing wheat must soon or late face the same
situation. The famous wheat fields of seventy-five
years ago are famous nb 'more. â¢ Who 1 hears of the
Genesee wheat of New York, that once had world
wide fame? The soft wheats of Minnesota and the
Red River of the North are declining,' and last year
the mills of Minneapolis had to run on wheat im
ported from Kansas. The latter State stumbled on a
variety of Russian. wheat brought by some immi
grants that was the means of recovery; of her posi
tion as a wheat-grower after all American varieties
had palled on her soil.
The lesson of the wheat-growing situation seems to
be a change of rural industries. On account of our
climate we have a wide range' from which to make
selection. We are doing almost nothing in textile
plants, while there is no' known reason why hemp and
flag: should not be ' profitable, or that experiments
with jute and ramie would not succeed. Our large
importation of cured pork products. should stimulate
hog-raising, which goes well with dairying, and is
not unnaturally associated with fruit farming. If we
are to "be protected against cane sugar from the islands
there is a call upon California sugar beets, the richest
in saccharine in the world, to supply the whole Amer
ican demand for that article. With irrigation other
root crops on a large scale are possible, arid as a
resource for stock feeding should be profitable.
It is evident that wheat exhausts soils in Califor
nia. The straw seldom goes into the manure heap to
be returned to the ground, and the assimilation of
manures, where irrigation is not used, is not- as feas
ible here as in' the v East.
that dairying returns to the soil .a larger proportion
of the plant food it takes therefrom than any other
form of agriculture.

Says That Shareholders
of a Defunct Concern
Were Robbed.
LONDON, July 30.â At the first meeting
of creditors to-day and at a subsequent
meeting of the shareholders of the Stand
ard Exploration Company one of the min
ing concerns known as the "Whittaker-
Wright Group," the official receiver made
such astounding revelations that he drew
from the excited shareholders demands for
the lynching of the persons implicated.
The receiver said that the estimated as
sets were farcical. The fourteen mines,
valued at Â£767,000, had earned nothing.
The company started with a cash capital
of Â£r>00,000. but the directors took little
interest in the company's mines and de
voted themselves to stock exchange spec
ulation. "And that'8 where your money
has Rone." said the receiver. "Â£228,000

1 Council of the Improved Qrder of
I Red Men of the reservation of
H California will be held in the "long Â«
house" of the order on Post street
on the 13th sun of the sturgeon moon,
which in ordinary English means Au
gust 13.
All the great chiefs, in high fettle, and
the representatives from the various
tribes will be present at the kindling of.
the council fire and will listen to the long
and the short talks that are to be made
by the great chiefs while following the

is likely to be a spirited contest in the
"long house" for the position of great .
junior sagamore. The known aspirants are
Thomas R. Roche of San Francisco and
C. S. Davis of Angels Camp, with possibly
two or three more to hear from. Porter
R. Bliss, great chief of records, and "W. J.

re-elected without opposition. Three rep
resentatives to the great council of the
United States are to be chosen and for
these positions there are named O. F.

ha; Annie E. Gillgreat, prophetess; Mrs.
E. J. Brazille, great keeper of records,

lines, and in the last year has done* a
great deal of good for its members.
The special features during the session
of the two orders will be a grand ball to
be given on the night of August 12 in Me
chanics' Pavilion, and a contest by teams
of the following tribes in the adoption de
gree: Manzanlta, Modoc, Pocahontas and

Second Performance of Old Grand
Opera Favorites, Who Are
Warmly Welcomed.
"Rlgolotto," second bill of the Tlvoli
grand opera season, last night introduced
to another overflowing house the second
contingent of the Tlvoli artists for the
seasonâ Ropctto, Poletini, Russo and Fer
rari.
Rigoletto was excellently done by Fer
rari, who received an ovation, and whoso
fine barytone is in admirable trim. The
mercurial little tenor, Russo, is naturally
castas the Duke of Mantua, and he sings,
as usual, with fire, sweetness and utmost
facility. He is a graceful figure as the
Duke, but plays altogether too much to
the gallery, creating a quite illegitimate
amusement in the last act. His perform
ance is utterly out of key there. But he
can sing! 'And there Is no doubt as to
his appreciation by the audience.
Repetto, the little pocket Melba, is as
charming a little artist as ever, and sang
'most delightfully' as Gllda, in that fine,
.pure, sweet, small voice of hers. Her
"Caro Nome" was beautifully given and
lavishly applauded,- and she received
many flowers as tangible appreciation of
her efforts. Poletini- repeated her last
year's good Magdalena, and Nlcolinl sang
and acted the small part of Sparafucile
to admiration. . .
The orchestral work was not up to Mon
day night's high level, being almost con
sistently overloud throughout, especially
in the violins, and more particularly in Re
petto's'solos and duets with Russo and,
Ferrari. Neither was the ensemble so
good, but it will doubtless be all right
on its second rendering to-morrow even-
Ing. To-night "Alda" will be given. â¢

"When Payne's syndicate secures control
of the 'Equitable Gas Company and the
Central Light and Power Company it will
join issues with the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company and its present
ally, the Pacific Gas Improvement Com
pany, and rates will be put up to the old
basis.
Payne does not represent the Baltimore
syndicate that recently purchased the
San Mateo and Sutter-street car lines.
The Pepper and Register syndicate of
Baltimore purchased the car lines men
tioned and It can be stated authoritatively
that this syndicate will not invest a sin
gle cent in any gas or electric light stock
in San Francisco, notwithstanding state
ments to the contrary.
Payne recently put up a forfeit of $20,
000 to neoure the property of the Equitable
Gas Company and the Central Light and
Powav Company. The Eastern capitalists

purchase price for the two companies
within ninety days. The plants of the
companies will be improved and a com
bine will then be formed with the San
Francisco Gas and Electri* Company and
its aid; tho Pacific Gasr .Improvement
Company.
It was predicted last evening that when
this combing takes place customers of
tho consolidated companies will be forced
to boar "nil the traffic will stand."
Paynels syndicate will not wage war
againstlthe San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company and the Pacific Gas Im
provement Company. The two latter
companies have for a long time worked
hand in hand. . The Pacific Gas Improve
ment Company is only to cut gas rates
where the mains oâ¬ the Equitable Com
pany supply, consumers. The San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company will not
reduce its rates In its own territory.
Despite every effort to keep secrecy ' It
was learned last evening on positive au
thority that an important deal is nearing
consummation in connection with the
affairs of the Equitable Gas Company
and the Central Light and Power Com

pass into the hands of a Baltimore syndi

XEW YORK, July 30.â The stock market this
morning confirmed the Impression created by
yesterday's market when the accumulation of
favorable factors over the Sunday signally
failed tc awaken any Interest in the specula
tion. Mindful of yesterday's experience, the
traders were even more disinclined to attempt
a movement of prices to-day. The dullness
and sluggishness of the market exceeded any
thing that had been seen last summer and
autumn, after the fall in prices on account of
the spring wheat shortage had been succeeded
by the period of waiting preceding the national
election. The extreme fluctuations reached as
high as a point in only a limited number of
stocks and in them as in the general market
the movement was wavering and uncertain.
The largest part of the dealings was in the
United States Steel stocks.. But the reports in
morning newspapers of the good prospects of
a settlement of the strike were ineffectual to
cause any strength in the stocks. Apparently
speculators were dissatisfied with prospects
however favorable of a settlement, and were
waiting for accomplished facts and signed
papers as a basis for determining the present
value and future prospects of these securities
There was a feeling of uncertainty also as to
how far the strike settlement had already been
discounted In the recent advance in the stocks
The few desultory advances in individual
stocks, some of them in obscure Industrials
were indifferently held. The whole market
sank more and more Into a waiting attitude.
The present ease of money takes that factor
out of immediate consideration. But the future
of the money market and the cautiousness of
bankers in locking up capital in long time
loans serves as a warning of possible future
contingencies. The course of the Government
revenues is a disappointment to those who
hoped for relocation of demands on the money
market from that source." In spite of the oper
ation of the amended revenue law, the Gov
ernment's receipts continue to run well over
those of laet year, while the expenditures thus
far this month have fallen more than $800 000
below those of July last year. As a conse
quence the Government deficit for this month
is only a little over $2,000,000, whereas It had
amounted to $4,665,639 by this time in July of
last year. The sub-treasury at New York has
taken over a million dollars from the market
since Friday last. For the last week in July
last year, preceding the Government Interest
disbursements in August, the sub-treasury
yielded a small amount to the money market.
The continuance of these unlooked-for condi
tions of the Government revenues will materi
ally affect money market conditions during the
period of interior crop demands upon New
York. These doubtful factors In the outlook
discouraged any buying demand and made the
market eoft and yielding even to the light sell
ing pressure that was brought to bear upon
it. The reactionary tendency gained force and
the closing was dull and weak at about the
lowest, many Important railroad stocks showing
net losses of a point or more. .
There was- some early show of strength in
the railroad bond market on a well diversified
demand, but best prices there were yielded in
the late dealings.
Total sales, par value. $1,123,000.
united States bonds were unchanged In quo
tation on the last call. Â¦

nearly normal, with hot days and cool nights
in the Interior, and warm, pleasant weather
w!th fog's along the coast.
Harvesting, threshing and hay baling have
progressed rapidly. In all sections north of
the Teha<hspi the yield of wheat, barley and
lye Is reported considerably heavier than that
ct last season, and late reports state that In
porticr.s of Southern California the yield of
wheat ar.d barley is much better than had
bf-en expected ; the grain is of excellent quality
in ell rectlcns. There is an unusually heavy
crop cf hay in tome districts, and farmers are
unable to secure presses for baling as rapidly
as desired Sugar beets, beans, hops and corn
ore in good condition, and will yield nearly
overage crops. A good crop of alfalfa Is being
harvrstcd. Irrigation water i* plentiful except
in portions of Southern California.
Th* yield of deciduous fruits is much below
overage, but in some sections the fruit is turn
ing out considerably better than was anticipated
a tew weeks ago. Peaches, pearb and prunes
from th? foothill districts are of excellent qual
ity. J'ickiiig. canning and drying are progress-
Ing. Graces are becoming quite plentiful in

hopf., pugar beets and corn are making good
growth, and large crops are expected. Fruit
drying nnd canning sre in progress. The yield
Is below average, but better in some places
than estimated a few weeks ago, and the qual- J
lty is generally excellent, especially in the
foothill districts. Blackbarries are abundant.
Grapes are in good condition, but the yield
will be light In many places. Citrus fruits con
tinue thrifty.
San Joaquin Valleyâ Clear and seasonable
weather has prevailed during the past week,
which was favorable for the ripening and har
vesting of all crops. The grain harvest is
progressing rsjidly. and in some sections is
about completed. Most of the grain is being
Etored in the warehouses. Deciduous fruits are
ripening rapidly, and in most sections the crop
is good and the quality excellent. Dryers and
canneries are in full operation. Peaches and
melons are plentiful. Grapes are making good
progress but as yet the supply in market is
light. In come eections the third crop of al
falfa is being cut. and Is fully as gpod as the
eecend crop. Stock of all kinds are ta good
condition and feed Is plentiful. Water in the
Irrigating ditches is commencing to get low.
Southern Californiaâ Warm days and cool
nights, with fogs along the coast, have been
favorable for crops. Citrus fruits and walnuts
ere in excellent condition, and will yield good
crops. Apricots in the vicinity of Santa Paula
are yielding better than expected. Beans are
looking well, and will yield a fair crop in most
reetions. though probably less than average.
The corn crop will be light. Wheat, barley,
hay and potatoes arÂ» yielding much better
crops, than anticipated, and in some places the
hay crop is nearly up to. average. Irrigation
water is falling off. Hay baling is progressing.

chipped in considerable quantities.

The Weather and Crops.
"Currants are about steady a.t S?i(g'9c for
good- quality. Holders as a rule are quoting
9c, but sales are being made right along at the
lower figure for small lots. Raisins are dull.
Apples are firm, with a good Jobbing demand."
"The scarcity of small fruits throughout the
country, particularly In the WeEt, has resulted
In more activity for dried fruits on the spot.
Both prunes and peaches are in good demand
from Jobbers and some Inquiry is noted for
round lots. Prunes are firm, especially on the
larger sizes, which are scarce. There was
come inquiry from the West in the market
yeFtÂ«?rday for choice peaches in bags. A fair
jobbing trade is doing in goods of this descrip
tion at 6%c up, according to quality. Only a
email trade is doing In apricots on the spot
and but small interest is manifested in new
'ccts.

Sympathizers Enjoy Treat by Cali-
Three immense casks of sparkling claret
wine from the California Wine and
Brandy Association, whose warehouse Is
fit the corner of Eighth and Brannan
streets, became dislodged from a truck
yesterr"3v afternoon shortly after 2 o'clock
at thr corner of Sixth and. Brannan
streets. The truck, which belongs to Stet
son Renner. was being driven bj' a, non
union driver, whose experience In the
handling of reins was not of the best. In
attempting to cross the street his truck
became caught in the Sixth street car
track, which caused it to suddenly lurch
thus spiiling the wine casks Into the
street. The driver dismounted and at
tempted to replace the liquor on the truck
hut was driven off by a band of sym
pathizers. â¢
After they had rescued the wine from
the driver the crowd, which was gaining
reinforcements from every side, broke In
the bunps. Great quantities of the liquor
were spilled into the street. It ran in
"reams down the gutter to the sewer.
BuTkets. bottles, jugs and even cups were
brought to the casks and quantities were
carried away. A perfect bucket brigade.
fully equipped, worked heroically to save
'he precious juice. Little boys filled the
vessels, while their elders "toted" them
away. Although the crowd worked stren
uously, both with mouth and buckets, the
major part of the beverage T*ent in a scar
let stream down the throat of the sewer
pipe. After the casks had been complete
ly emptied, a gas pipe, was secured and
several cf the crowd proceeded to batter
the casks to pieces. They had succeeded
in effecting- the ruin of one when Sergeant
Shaw, with a force of police, arrived and
drove the crowd back.
â¢
POLICE FORCE IS INADEQUATE.
Most of the City Is Left Unpro-
Four hundred members of the San Fran
cisco Police Department are at present
engaged by the strike. This means that
every man capable of performing duty is
engaged in preserving peace and order in
the district affected by the strike. The
number of policemen engaged in office
duty has been reduced to a minimum, and
the jails have been left to the care of but
two or three men.
The outlying districts are being pa
trolled by a half dozen men. and only two
are doing crossing duty on Market street.
The officers perform twelve hours' duty
at a stretch.
The preservation of law and order Is
under the direction of Captain Wittman.
His men have been 'given orders to pre
vent the congregating of any number of
people in the district wherein trouble is
likely to occur. They have orders to lisa
their clubs on any one who- shows a desire
to cause a disturbance and to protect the
men who are taking the places of the
strikers.
Chief of Police Sullivan said yesterday
that the rumor that he was to turn the
task of preserving peace over to the Sher
iff was wholly unfounded. The Chief says
his men are capable of performing- their
duties In preventing strife and bloodshed
and that there will be no necessity for
calling for assistance from any other
municipal department.
ARBITRATION IS URGED.
Federation of Improvement Clubs
Would Settle Troubles.
The Municipal Federation of Improve
ment Clubs held a meeting last night for
the purpose of discussing ways and means
to arrange a conference between the Em
ployers' Association and the laboring in
terests. A resolution to Increase the in
dustrial conciliatory council to 100 mem
bers was voted down as being premature.
It was decided to instruct the secretary
to canvass the names of members of the
federation with a view toward inducing
100 of them to sign a written agreement
to perform active work in the line of con
ciliation.
A resolution was adopted earnestly ap
pealing to employers and employes in the
name of the welfare of the city to meet
in conference and by both sides making
concessions restore peace and industrial
activity.
J. McDonald deprecated the alleged In
trmfon of the Employers' Association to
crush unionism, and advocated the pas
sage of a resolution asking the employers
to give the employes a hearing. Speeches
v.-ore also made by Charles Alpers, E. A.
I^orenzo and N. B. Greensfelder.
O. K. Cushing presided at the meeting
and E. A. Lorenzo was secretary.

CHINESE MURDERER
ABRESTED IN" NAPA
Detective Ed Gibson Leaves to Bring
Jue Lin Ong Back to the
City.
' Captain Seymour received I a dispatch
yesterday morning from Sheriff Dunlap of
Napa that a Chinese had been arrested
there answering the description of Jue
Lin Ong, who murdered the Chinese boy,
Jue Do Hong, at 828 Washington street
Monday morning. The arrested man had
papers in his possession that showed his
identity. The captain at once instructed
Detective Ed Gibson to leave for Napa to
bring the prisoner back to the city.
Yesterday afternoon Seymour also re
ceived a dispatch from Chief of Police
Elton of Los Angeles that a Chinese, who
gave the name of Fong Yung, had been
arrested on the train that arrived from
this city. He answered the description of
the murderer, except that he had two
gold teeth in his lower Jaw instead of hla
upper Jaw. A poll tax receipt found on
him was in the name of Chew Len Ong. .
It 1b believed that the Napa man is the
one wanted, but Seymour wired Chief El
ton to hold Fong Yung till Gibson re
turned from Napa, when it will be defi
nitely known If the prisoner, there Is .the

V CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, July 30.â In ad
vance of the question coming before him
officially, Commissioner General of Immi
gration Powderly willl j not express an
opinion as to whether the sugar planters
of Hawaii can import Filipinos or Chi
nese from the Philippine Islands to work
on their planta-tions. The planters com
plain of the great scarcity of labor and
contend that they will not be able to se
cure sufficient help if they are not al
lowed to contract for Chinese or other
laborers.
They tried the Porto RIcans without
good results, as the natives of that island
were not accustomed to such hard and
continuous work as was required of them
by their Hawaiian employers. Powderly
Inclines to the belief that the labor
problem of Hawaii would be easily solved
if the planters were willing to pay wages
which would attract the kind of labor
they require. There are in the Southern
States of the United States thousands of
colored men who would make Ideal la
borers on the Hawaiian plantations If
they were offered sufficient wages to in
duce them to leave their homes here and
remove to the islands. The contract labor
law does not stand in Â¦ the way of their
employment, but as far. as is known in
Washington no effort has ever been made
by the planters to secure the colored la
bor from the Southern States.

The information concerning the ambus
cade and slaying of Tetabiate came to
day to R. P. Sharp of the Rey Del Oro
Mining Company of Mulatos, who is at
the Hollenbeck Hotel. The letter telling
of the last stand of the Yaquis was sent
from Guaymas by Dr. Elliott Wolfe, for
merly of this city. It contained no de
scription of the battle between the Yaquis
and the Mexicans, but Dr. Wolfe says the
killing of the chief and the demoralization
of the band means the termination of thÂ»
two years of murder and slaughter that
has clouded the history of the republic.
LOS ANGELES, July 30.â Tetabiate, thÂ»
warrior chief of the Yaquis, was am
bushed and slain several days ago near
Potam, Mexico. Fourteen of his braves
were killed and forty-seven captured by
the Mexican troops under General Torres.
This victory of the Mexican troopa has
caused general rejoicing- throughout that
portion of Mexico lying east of Quaymas.
and it is considered by all that the Yaquis
have made their last stand.

Commander of the Colon Says Nice
Things of th.s Admiral.
NEW YORK, July 30.â A Journal spe
cial from Madrid says: Captain Emilia
Diaz Moreu, who commanded the Cristo
bal Colon during the battle of "Santiago,
paid a glowing tribute to-day to Admiral
Schley and the Brooklyn. He said: '
"All the American officers, with no excep
tion, did their duty in the naval battle at
Santiago. So did we. although It "Is cer
tain we were vanquished by superiority
of force. It is absurd and unpatriotic to
make an exception in the case of Admiral
Schley. It Is absurd because the Brook
lyn was in the thick of the fight through
out. She was at the mouth of the harbor
when we tried to pass out and engaged
us with a terrific fire, doing frightful dam
age- to the end. We surrendered to the
Brooklyn forty-five miles west of San
tiago. f
"The Brooklyn was the first to encoun
ter us as we were coming out and the first
to lead In pursuit, and she kept up tha
lead, with the Oregon vastly aiding. ThÂ«
Brooklyn's conduct was brave; henc*
Schley's was brave. Schley was on a
post, where he was put by Sampson.
After the battle commenced each com
mander acted according to circumstances,
and events show the Brooklyn bore a
brave part.
"Of all the American ships the Brook
lyn was the most exposed to our fire, and
to that of our batteries. Schley's own re
port was a model of plain, sailorllke and,
gentlemanly statement. Schley directed
that our officers retain their personal ef
fects. A coward Is never generous. The
suggestion of cowardice probably cornea
from cowards." n

The swindlers owned a yacht called the
Westesmine, on board of which' tneir

plucked. The police also traced to the
gang the promotion of a number of fic
titious mining and coal companies. The
investigations of the police led to the
flight of the swindlers. Several of them
have gone to Abyssinia. Herebout sailed
for Holland. The revelations have caused
a sensation in club and sporting circles.
A majority of the members of the gang
had assumed high-sounding titles and fre
quented fast circles and clubs. One mem
ber, a brother of a -well known Abyssinian
explorer, who styled himself "Count."
was arrested. Two others were self
styled barons and one had given himself
the title of "Prince." They occupied
sumptuous apartments in the Champs
Elysee and Madelaine quarters, to which
they inveigled gilded youths and swindled
them at baccarat. The losses of Prince
Karageorgovitch and four young men of
good families, who complained to the po
lice, alone amounted to 370,000 francs.

betting 12 to 1 against the horse. A week

NEW YORK, July 30.â Dr. A. J. Res
tapo, agent of the Colombian insurgents,
and Raoul Perez, who was General Uribe
Uribe's private secretary, declare, the
Times will say to-morrow, that the gen
eral is now In Colombia. / They refused
to tell just where he is, but said that they
expect cable advices from him to-mor
row. He will' have the assistance, they
say, of General Herrera and General Ma
rin and their armies. The latter has 3000
men in the Interior of the Department of
Tollma.
Senor Perez explained that In Colombia
there has always been a certain degree of
antagonism between the Freemasons and
the clergy, and that this fact was taken
advantage of by the insurgent party.
Sympathizers all over the world, he aver
red, contributed $200,000 for munitions for
General Uribe Uribe's operations. Dr.
Restapo. Senor Perez further explained,
while he was In . Europe bought 15,000
Mauser rifles of the most modern pattern.
He also bought 2.000.000 cartridges with
the funds. Uribe Uribe being in need of
ammunition. All this armament, Senor
Perez says, was shipped months ago to
Cclombia In sailing vessels, labeled as po
tatoes and asparagus.
Still further, according 10 X^erez, If the
Liberal party, of which General . Uribe
Uribe Is the head, succeeds in overthrow
ing the Conservative party's Government
the French Panama Canal Company will
be notified that all of Its concessions are
void, that company having been notified
some time ago if it bought concessions
when the Government was willing to sell
it would gain nothing if the Liberals won.

â¢ The Chilean lejratfon in London does not
consider the situation In any degree men
acing. The work of arbitrating the bound
ary dispute, which was undertaken by
Great Britain, is goin^ on steadily. The
rumors of war preparations may be only
political moves, and neefl not necessarily
be taken as indicating a change in the
relations between the two Governments.
It is certain, however, that any Increase

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July 30.â The
National Socialist convention made an ef
fort to-day to harmonize and was par
tially successful. A message was sent to
Eugene V. Debs declaring the convention
to be harmonious.
Eugene V. Debs, . when asked at his
home in Terre Haute to-night for an ex
pression concerning the action of the con
vention toward him, said:
"The term' 'shelved' has little or no sig
nificance with me. They may shelve me
if they like. I have no personal desire to
be called a leader. The action of v the
Springfield faction does not disconcert me
in the least. It is simply an effort on the
part of the Eastern faction to dictate to
the Chicago' faction, of, which I am a
member. The convention In Indianapolis
is not a representative body of Socialists,
as the Springfield faction is largely in the
majority and is in a position to dictate."
The platform committee reported at 3
o'clock this afternoon. The platform as
reported declares that private ownership
of the tools of production and distribu
tion Is responsible for the ever-increas
ing uncertainty of livelihood and the pov
erty and misery of the working class,
and it divides society into two hostile
classes â the capitalists and wag-ework
ers. It advocates as "immediate de
mands" public ownership of all means of
transportation, communication and other
public utilities as well as all industries
controlled by monopolies, trusts and com
bines; the reduction of the hours of labor.

Footpads, appreciating the fact that
owing to the strike the residence portion
of this city is without police protection,
have begun to operate. A young man
was found unconscious last night shortly
after midnight on Jackson street, near
Oough, and his appearance Indicated that
he was the victim of robbers.
His pockets had been turned inside out
and everything that would lead to his
identity removed.
The cuff buttons had been wrenched
from his shirt sleeves, and his clothing
save evidence that it had been thoroughly
searched.
The victim of the footpad was found
lying near the edge of the sidewalk by
Special Officer McMahon. He was breath
ing heavily and evidently suffering from
a heavy blow on the head.
The special summoned the ambulance
and sent the young man to the Emer
gency Hospital. On examination there it
was found that his unconscious condition,
was caused by a blow on the back of his
head, evidently from a slung-shot-
The doctors tried to revive the thug's
victim, but their efforts were fruitless.
They fear the blow will prove fatal.
Â¦ The victim of the robber is about 23
years of age, and is well dressed.

' Agreeably to promise we are enabled,
through the courtesy of California sharehold-
ers, who have Just . returned from a vUit to
the properties of Montezuma Mining Co., near
Fairfax. Washington, to present to the large
body of shareholders, who could not accom-
pany the excursion, and to prospective Invest-
ors as well, many strong letters of ccm-
mendation of both properties and management.
These letters are written by honorable men
who are competent to do their own thinking
and in* their reports tell "the whole truth and
nothing but the truth" of" the Montezuma's
great copper and coal properties. We repro-
duce below brief quotations from these letters
which are printed in full In circular form and
will be mailed free on application.'
â¢ quotations.
"If there ever was a copper 'show' to make
stTckholders enthusiastic that is the 'Monte-
zuma's.' "
"My specimens, taken at random from Ihe
tunnels, contain better values than the ore
on exhibition at the company's offlce."
"The veins of coal already uncovered, vary-
ing from 5 to 11 feet in width, convinced me
that my investment was a good one."
"The great difficulties that stood In the way
of opening up this property will, when over-
come, enable the plant to be worked almost
automatically." (this refers to water power
and drainaee tunnels.)
"Too much praise caffnot be given 'to the
management of Colonel C. W. Thompson, the
president of the company. His very presence
i assures one of the successful completion of
the work he has taken in hand."
"I found the properties to be much more
developed than I had expected and in mi-
Judgment more valuable than represented. All
the work connected with them seems to have
been done In a systematic and economical
manner, consistent w.ith a well-matured gen-
eral plan of operating a large property."
"Nature has certainly exerted herself In
favor of the Montezuma Mining Company.
Your circulars, as sent out from time to time,
do not set forth the wonderful possibilities of
the district. I am satisfied the officers of the
. company are men of integrity and ability and
thoroughly conversant with their business."
"I undertook the trip with some doubt of
the final outcome, expecting the usual exhlbl-
'. tion of a "hole in the ground," and a voluble
description of what we are going to do. but
â¢ imagine by surprise when a full realization of
the possibilities and magnitude of the under-
taking dawned upon me. I believe my in-
: vestment beyond the point of speculation and
' in the realm of the 'sure thing." "
"Every indication points to the fact that the
Montezuma has in this 'Taeoma' mine a fund
of almost inexhaustible wealth."
As the natural "result of this visit of share-
' holders and the subsequent Increased sale of
shares, prices are advancing and installment
, terms are stiffening. All Installment terms
prior to this date are withdrawn and the
schedule given below will hold for only a
. short time.
â PRICES.
The present price â¢ t Montezuma shares is
15c cash or 17c on installments. After August
1 the price will be ISc cash or 21c on install-
ments, the company reserving the right to
withdraw these prices without notice.
INSTALLMENT TERMS.
1C00 shares, $10 down and $10 monthly.
SCOO shares, $30 down and $30 monthly.
4000 shares, $40 down and $40 monthly.
C0OO shares. $30 down and $42 50 monthly.
6000 shares, $60 down v and $51 monthly. â¢ : â¢ '
10.M0 shares, $1CO down and $85 monthly.
The quality of Montezuma shares is evi-
denced by the fact that the slump In oil stocks
and the prevailing labor troubles do not
seriously interfere with our business. Monte-
zuma has the confidence of every shareholder
and Is making new converts every day.
'It is the biggest and safest; mining company
on the continent that offers its shares by popu-
lar subscription.
N. B.â We make a standing offer of $100 and
expenses to the person who. after visiting the
Montezuma mines, finds we have made a sin-
gle misstatement thereof.

PRINCIPALS IN A ROMANTIC
MARRIAGE WHICH OCCURS* AT
RENO TO-DAY. ADAMS PHOTO.
?
. Secretary Emery of the Board of Health
made the discovery yesterday that Chi
nese were recording their certificates of
birth in Ithe Recorder's office many years
after the" births occurred, whereas the law
requires that they shall be recorded with
in thhtydays. Emery sees In this viola
tion of the law a chance for the wily Ce
lestials to evade the . exclusion act by
sending the certificates to Chinese in the
Orient who are desirous of quitting China
and who use this method to defeat the
ends of the act. â " : ,
Recorder Godchaux states that during
the last year and a half more than_500
Chinese ihave appeared before him with
affidavits signed by notaries public show
ing that tho former were born on a cer
tain date In San Francisco or some other
American city. Many of <the Chinese
were born 1 thirty or more years ago and
r.o registration of their birth was ever
made.. The purpose of obtaining a certifi
cate, many of them state, is to -guard
against complications in . the^ event of a
visit to China; It is held that certificates
Issued after a lapse of thirty years, when
all evidence as required by law _is_ de
stroyed,, are illegal. Recorder Godchaux
has directed the attention of the Mayor
to the facts as' noted in his annual report,
filed with that official yesterday. The re
port further says:
I deem it! my duty to refer to the necessity
that exists for greater care and diligence In

law requires that a report of all and

roll themselves on ! their club register,
with the view of electing a superior class
of. delegates to the nominating conven

These remarks were indorsed by

foremost in advocating clean politics and
good men for office. Mark Anthony was
emphatic in his denunciation of corrupt
methods': in politics. Zacharias Taylor

Republican In the district, was outspoken
against boss rule.

signs point to anti-boss triumph at the

abandoned the plan of putting up straight

Mitchell bringre word that W. T. Jeter
of Santa Cruz, who was the appointee of
Governor Budd as Lieutenant Governor
of the State; Barney Murphy of San Jose,
r.owa bank commissioner; Dr. Washington
Dodge.' City and County Assessor of San
Francisco, not to mention former Gover
nor Budd and' Mayor M. P. Snyder of this
city, all have their admirers for the nom
ination, among northern Democrats.
"We are. in no mood," concluded Mitch
ell, "to chase strange gods any further,
but will next year go before the people
with a ticket and platform of the variety
which was utilized before Bryanism was
known to the party."
The local Democrats, not to be outdone,
are also talking of available timber. John
"W. Mitchell of the Democratic State Cen
tral â¢ Committee has just returned from
San Francisco with the boom of Garret
McEnerney' in his waistcoat , pocket.
Mitchell is certain that Garret McEner
ney would prove the most formidable
candidate the Democracy could find for
the head of its State ticket, but he quali
fies his opinion with the statement that
the well-known San Francisco lawyer
could probably not be induced to accept
the nomination." Â¦: ~. â¢ "
The latest aspirant for the chief office
of the State is a man between 40 and 45
years of age. He is spoken of as a man
of a retiring "disposition, who thinks and
acts, but seldom talks at any great length.
He is a Native Son of the Golden West.
Furthermore Power has amassed a tidy
fortune in the mining business, which will
enable him. to carry on a vigorous cam
paign. . .;.
John F. Kidder, who came to California
in the days of gold, wanted to represent
the Second Congressional District in that
convention. Kidder died a short time ago,
leaving a considerable fortune. During
his long life in the mining districts of the
State he had only to ask a favor at the
hands of. the Republicans to have it grant
ed. For many years Kidder was State
Debris Commissioner. .When he became
a candidate as delegate to the convention
which named President McKinley^for a
second term he found that Harold Power
was also a candidate for that honor. After
a hard fight Power won out. In winning
from so formidable an â¢ opponent, Power
proved beyond any question his strength
in the mountain districts.
Jacob Neff,. Lieutenant Governor of Cal
ifornia,, whose feeling for, Governor Gage
is known to be none too friendly, is said
to be the man who will urge and fight for
Power's nomination when the proper time
comes. While Power's name is hardly one
to #onjure with at the present time in
southern political circles, he has a brief
political history. In the Xhirty-second
California' Assembly he represented Pla
cer County, but he " showed his greatest
strength when delegates were elected to
the last national Republican convention
at Philadelphia. - .

The ' regular - Democratic Club of the

following officers: . - '
President, â¢- Saul Magner; first vice
president, Joseph B.: Kennedy r second
vice president, Thomas J. Cooney; secre
tary, John C. Quinlan; treasurer, Joseph
P. Marshall ; - nominating - committee-

Russell.-
Manzer and Robert Haight.' in which the
hundred Democrats present a- were . , ex
horted to maintain organization to insure
the success of the -party at the:next
election. Mayor Phelan was- roundly
scored for using his high office to further
his own political 'aspirations. 'â¢Â¦ i .'"Â¦ Â¦
"In the first place, the majority of the
streets under which the cables -are laid
are paved with asphaltum, and water does
not percolate through that substance. In
addition to this surface protection, the
asphaltum rests on rubble and sand, whils
the lead-encased electric/cables are em
bedded in terra-cotta conduits surrounded
on all sides by four Inches of concrete. â¢
"It would be impossible for water to
percolate from the surface of the streets
to the -cables." â¢ .,
"Another false statement is the one that
'the cost, of tearing up the streets to lay
the gas mains deterred the establishment
of the Independent Gas Company.'
"The matter of laying the pipes in the
streets has been hel<? up. owing to an or
dinance passed by < the Board of Supervi
sors requiring the company to pay for the
cost of inspection of the pipe . by the
Board of Public "Works. This would en
tail an extra expense of $60,000 on the com
pany. The amount is not of such vital
importance, but it is the principle of the
thing. . :
"The old gas company was not required
to have its ; pipes inspected and pay city
officials for doing so. It is to the inter
est of the new company to lay its pipes
in proper manner. Claus Spreckels i says
that he will not lay a single pipe under
such an ordinance. The old company was
not required to do so, and it is unjust and
unfair that the new company should be
thus imposed upon. \ *
"The oft-repeated absurd stories made
in the morning and. evening yellow .lour-"
nals that the underground cables of the
Independent Electric Company .were'af
fected by water in rainy weather serve
to amuse practical electricians. The many
thousand citizens , who * saw the work ; of
placing the cables under the streets can
readily realize the absurdity of such
statements. . .
"It is false to say that the Independent
Gas Company has vanished. On the con
trary, the work at the Potrero of build
ing the generating houses and gas hold
ers is progressing actively and will be so
continued until the works are finished.
Gas Plant to Be Finished.
"Not a single piece of gas pipe has been
shipped from this city to be sold else
where. The gas pipe was shipped to San
Francisco via Seattle, and that is the only
manner in which Seattle can be. men
tioned in connection with the pipe of the
Independent Gas Company.
"Another statement that is false is the
one that says a large quantity of gas pipe
intended for the Independent Gas Com
pany has been shipped io Seattle and sold
in that city. Â¦..Â».â¢
"Neither Attorney Preston nor myself
have ever met these gentlemen in con
nection with the sale of the Independent
Company. We are not conducting any
negotiations of sale; we have not done so
art do not propose to do so.
, "The statement that Attorney Preston
and myself have conducted negotiations
for the safe of the Independent Company
'.and that we have met the other side, as
represented by I. W. Hellman, Henry
Wadsworth, Antoine Borel and Daniel
Meyer, is absolutely, false.
Report of Negotiations False.
"The sale of the Independent Light and
Power Company has never been thought
of by us. Another false statement in the
article i3 the one that customers have
fallen off. As a matter of fact, customers
are conning in every day to sign contracts
and expired contracts are being daily re
newed. Eight to a dozen contracts are
signed daily. The workmen of the com
pany are kept busy from morning till
evening making connections from the
street mains to houses and places of busi
ness of customers.
"It is false to say that competition in
lighting in this city is .to end. Claus
Spreckels proposes to run- the companies
I have mentioned on the same lines he
has followed from their inception up to
the present time. *f .
"There is not a single word Â»of truth
in the article as to the plant of the Inde
pendent Light Company being more cost
ly than expected. On the contrary, the
cost of equipment has been less than was
estimated when the work commenced.
Claus Spreckels returned last evening
from Lake Tahoe. but an interview was
had yesterday with John D. Spreckels. In
speaking of the publication in the Ex
aminer Mr. Spreckels said: "There is not
a word of truth in this article from its
beginning to its ending. My father, Claus
Spreckels, has not sold the Independent
Electric Light and Power Company and
the Independent Gas Company â¢ to any
competitor.
Positive Denial of Sale.
The ma so of falsehood and fabrication
only served to create amusement to the
few readers of 'the sensational morning
paper and, when an equally saffron-hued
evening paper swallowed the Examiner's
wild and lurid tale, publishing it with
many embellishments, more - amusement
was caused.
As a matter of fact, the Independent
Electric Light and Power Company is
signing daily from eight to twelve new
contracts with city consumers of electric
light and power and the workmen of the
company are kept busy, making . connec
tions from the street mains to the places
of business of patrons..
The Examiner manufactures a - tale Â¦ of
how 'Claus Spreckels was "tired of the
electric light business," and says it was
"no easy task to get customers." The pa
per then enters into a stupid explanation
of "high and low voltage currents," and
in its ignorance endeavors to 6how that
the power of the Spreckels company wa3
too costly for this city.
Equally false statements appear in the
article as to the cost of .the. Independent
Electric Light and Power Company's
plant, and the paper tells of the "costly
mistakes made by the engineers" who had
the work of construction in charge.
Contracts Signed Daily.
Not content with making the statement
that Claus Spreckels "was prepared to sell
the two companies, the "monarch of the
dailies" goes into details as to the*alleged
negotiations and, I without the 'Sghtest
authority, quotes the names of prominent
citizens who are "conducting the negotia
tions."
The article, displayed with strong head
lines and occupying almost a "column, has
not a single line that contains jsven the,,
semblance of truth.
Among all the "fakes" it has published
in the last few weeks none has been more
willfully false than its statement made
yesterday that the Independent Electric
Light and Power Company and the Inde
pendent Gas Company would be sold by
Claus Spreckels to the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company. . - . Â¦ (v.
