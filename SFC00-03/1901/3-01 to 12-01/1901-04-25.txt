"CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W..WASHINGTON, April 24.â Complete In
dependence as an indispensable preliminary
to a discussion of the question of future
relations between the United States and
Cuba is what the delegates from the Cu
ban Constitutional Convention will ask of
the administration to-morrow. The mem
bers cf the commission who arrived In
Washington this morning are Domingo
Mendez Capote, president of the Cuban
Constitutional Convention; Diego Tamayo,
member of the National party; Pedro
Gonzales Lorente, lawyer and scientist;
General Pedro E. Betancourt and Rafael
M. Portuondo. They are accompanied by
Pedro N. Entenza. as interpreter, and two
representatives of the Havana press.
Wood's Course Is Upheld.
Primed with facts given to them" by
Brigadier General Leonard Wood, who
also arrived this morning, the President
and Secretary Root will receive the Cuban
commissioners to-morrow and will tell
them that the Platt amendment must bo
accepted before the United States will
withdraw from Cuba.
As the result of a conference lasting two
hours this afternoon, tha President ha*
unreservedly approved General Wood's
course In the negotiations with the con
stitutional convention. This approval had
been anticipated by Secretary Root, with
whom General Wood was closeted this
morning for almost four hours, and who
had * commented favorably upon his
course.
Courtesy of the Commission.
The commissioners were met at the rail
road station by Assistant Secretary of
State Hill. Assistant Secretary of War
Sanger and Captain Sawtelle and Lieu
tenant Overton of the army, who escorted
them to the Shorehani Hotel, where rooms
had been engaged. They remained at tho
hotel during the forenoon and Assistant
Secretaries Hill and Sanger left cards for
the Secretary tf State and Secretary of
War. They went on a shopping expedition
at noon and In the afternoon had a con
ference In their rooms to discuss their
course of action while in Washington.
One of the points- determined by the
commissioners was that they would not
say anything for publication regarding
their mission to "Washington until after
they had called on President McKlnley.
President Capote and General Betancourt
were very courteous, but declined to talk
on the ground that their position was one
of extreme delicacy and that courtesy to
the President required that nothing should
be said through the newspapers until
after they had talked with him. The
other members of the delegation took the
same stand. t
â¢Independence Comes First.
The delegation has not come to Wash
ington in any spirit of hostility toward
the United States. They believe that SO
per cent of the Cubans desire absolute In
dependence and thev have come to voice
ttvit aspiration. Until this question of ab
solute independence has been definitely
settled they will nut discuss any other
basis for future relations between their
island and the United States.
What the Cuban delegates desire, next
to independence, Is an arrangement by
which the products of their island may
be admitted to the United States on pay
ment of reduced tariff taxes. This will
be strongly urged upon the President and^
Secretary of "War. but It Is a matter with
which the administration has not full
power to deal.
Reciprocal Reduction.
In order to bring about a reciprocal re
duction of the tariff between the United
States and Cuba there must either be
direct legislation by both 'houses of Con
gress or a treaty must be negotiated
which would requlie the approval of tho
Senate.
The President can so no further In this
direction than to promise the Cubans that
he will try to brtng, about reductions of
the tariff on article* imported from Cuba,

The banquet will take place simultaneous

every effort will be made by the fair host
esses to make the welcome accorded the
ladles oft the Presidential party of equal
warmth and splendor to that which will
greet the President and his suite. The
entire second floor of the California Ho

cluding 1 a eulte of dressing-rooms on the
third floor, witji a corps of waltins
women in attendance. General Warfleld
l;aa also placed the large dining-room of
the hotel, at the service of the ladies and
he has promised the finest menu ever
served In Ban Francisco for their enter
tainment. The Hawaiian band and tne
]..-::..- orchestra will furnish sweet mu>
eic for the occasion,
forgetting that'many of the
visitors will be ladies, are preparing for
them a welcome as fitting and hearty as
that which awaits the chief executive and
his officers. There are many of the events
which are necessarily for the men exclu
sively and the- ladies of San Francisco
have taken advantage of these intermis
sions to plan receptions and banquets and
feminine functions galore; and the most
prominent of these is the banquet planned
by the ladles of the Ohio Society.

tinguished guests, the affair will be strict
ly^ private. It is on the same afternoon
and "during, the same hours as the recep
tion to the ladies to be given In', the Hop

plenty of time for the ladles of the Presi
dential party to attend both functions.

Oakland School' Children Are to Be
in Line.
OAKLAND, April 24.â The school chil
dren of. Oakland will be one of the* feat
ures; of the visit of President McKlnley
to this city. Oakland is proud of its
schools and its Bchool children and tho
local; committee has decided that no bet
ter reception could be given the President
of the nation than to have the rising gen
eration give him a welcome. Incidentally
It will give the children an opportunity
to see the man who has been making the
history they will read about In after years.
.The school children of Oakland will bo
lined up. by schools. and classes along the
line of the President's drive through the
city. The line of children win begin at
the . corner of Purant and Franklin
streets and will run alone Durant street
tÂ« JacKeo,n,'d.qwn JaoHspn street to ThlrÂ«

Webster, The. children will be drawn up
on each side ef the streets for ever a

In. order to. prevent & repetition of -etieh
an" Incident the children will not be trust,

given small American flags. The ' local
committee has placed an '< order for S000
of .these flags and the Presidential optics
will be .safe.
to be a speaking likeness of the leader of
our ..Government. The President has
promised a sitting to the artiste during

DISSENSION OVER BTTDGET.
Who Offers to Resign.
LONDON, . April , 25.â The date of Lord
Salisbury's .return to London from the
Riviera is still problematical and the
rumors of Cabinet trouble over the budget
are assuming greater consistency In the
lobbies of Parliament. According to the
Daily Mail, tfie framing of the budget
revealed considerable dissension. Cham
berlain, the Colonial Secretary, wanted
the whole cost of the war. raised on the
credit of the South African colonies and
had "schemes of his own for providing the
interest on the loan and the Increase of
normal expenditure.
To these schemes, however, with the
exception of the coal duty. Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach turned a deaf ear, and on
being pressed, he offered to resign. Cham
berlain, according to the Daily Mail, fa
vored the resignation, but Lord Salisbury
and Balfour strongly opposed it.
Now it. Is said that . although" at first
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach did not advo
cate a coal tax, he now declines to drop
it, thinking his reputation would suffer,
now that he Is committed to It., He has,
however, agreed to give careful consider
ation to the alternative proposal to sub
stitute an ad valorem duty, on a basis of
8 or 9 pence on Inferior coal, rising to
18 pence on the best Welsh coal. While
this would mollify the northern colliery
owners, it Would intensify the opposition
from Wales, and the belief prevails that
the upahot will be either the abandonment
qf the tax ftUegether or the resignation
of the Ministry. â¢

LONDON, April 24.â J. X. Merriman, the
former Treasurer of Cape Colony, who Is
how a representative of .the Afrikander
Bund in England, speaking at a meeting
of the League of Liberals to-day against
aggression and militarism, said military
law, the abnegation of all laws, was
established in Cape Colony.. The news
papers had not heard of the treachery and
espionage going on. Respectable people
were committed upon the evidence of na
tives alone. They were brought up and
fined for â¢ harmless observations, called
seditious, and the town guards harried
them. These things created greater Irri
tation and Indignation than actual vio
lence.
Ittay Lose South Africa.
' The press was deliberately stopped and
four editors had been sent to jail. The
fruits of this policy would be bitter, as
the memory of these insults burned in the
hearts of the people.
Merriman detailed instances of punish
ment of the Dutch under military law.
usually upon the testimony of natives and
employes. He mentioned an Instance of
a "cheeky girl" being, fined for saying
things against the town guards. Martial
law and the censorship throughout Cape
Colony prevented the people of England
from knowing the hardships of the Dutch.
As an Englishman , Merriman ,said he
viewed the policy pursued in Cape Colony
with the blarkeÂ«t dismay. . If-ptrntsted
In... South Africa, was lost to the British
empire. The only thing that could save
It was the recognition that the . people
wanted self-government, and were de

The majority, of the women had been
placed In them against their will. Their
homes had been burned and their posses

the military authorities, through the Gov

DYING WORDS
ARE RULED OUT
Prosecutors in Eastman
Case Lose Important
Point. '" '"'Â¦"Â¦'
CAMBRIDGB, Mass., April 24.â The
prosecution lost Its first critical point in
the admission of evidence against Profes
sor Eastman of Harvard College, who Is
on trial in the Superior ' Court charged
with the murder of his brother-in-law,
Richard Grogan Jr., when Judge Gaskill
stated that certain evidence, in the form
of a repetition of the statement alleged to
have been made by Grogan as he was dy
ing, was not admissible in a certain fonn
which tended to convey the' opinion ami
not " the. fact as to 'whether he ' (Grogan)
had been v "killed" or "murdered."- The
point raised by Attorney Elder for the
prisoner apparently was unexpected by
the Attorney General.
â¢ Lota Broughton, a witness, was asked
to repeat what, she had heard Grogan say,
her testimony having already gone beyond
the point where It had been shown that
Grogan was wounded. Elder, interposing
said he anticipated the answer to be,
"Charles, you've murdered me," and to it
he objected as incompetent evidence upon
the plain ground that It was Grogan's
opinion, not a specific declaration of the
dying man. ; On the same ground he ob
jected to evidence already presented,
which in effect was open and not bare
statement of fact. : Â¦
Attorney. Knowlton took the opposite
ground, but the decision was against the
government in almost every particular,
the exception- being that the identical
words objected to were allowed to stand
In the direct testimony of Titus, a drug
gist, who saw the struggle between Gro-'
gan and Eastman and heard the former
speak immediately of having been shot.
The concluding witness, and one whose
evidence was expected to be Important,
was Belle Bryan, the :â¢ housekeeper for
Mrs. Grogan. Her story had not: pro
ceeded enough at to-day's adjournment to
disclose the government's strength' at this
point in its chain of circumstances.

YOUNG CUDAHY TELLS
HOW HE WAS KIDNAPED
Omaha Boy on the Witness-Stand in
the Case Against James .
Callahan.
OMAHA, April 24.â The case of the
State against James Callahan was briefly
presented to the jury by County Attorney
Shields this morning, and E. A. Cudahy,
one of the central figures in the kidnap
ing incident, took the stand. Mr. Shields
said that the State would seek to identify
Callahan as one of the men who. in the
guise of a county official, seized young
Cudahy in front of his home. He will
further endeavor to show that Callahan
stood guard over the boy In the house on
Grover street.
After the jury in the Callahan case had
Inspected the scene of the kidnaping to
day the chief witnesses in the case.' E. A.
Cudahy and his son Howard, took the
stand, and the latter's testimony was not
concluded when court adjourned. Young
Cudahy described the journey to the
house on Grover street and related at
length his conversations with his. jailer,
who is thought to have been Callahan.
The boy later listened to a conversation
in Chief Donahue's office between the
Chief and Callahan, and the. identification
will rest on a recognition of voice rather
than any similarity of feature. The other
testimony of the youth was substantially
au has appeared In the press reports.
In the examination of the elder Cudahy
the attorney for the defense brought out
the point that the packer had surrendered
the $25,000 without compulsion. The State
followed, the allegation In the ."complaint
set' forth that a robbery was committed
when. the gold was extorted from Cudahy
through 'threats- on his son's llfe. : Mr.
Cudahy conceded that Tie gave up the
money freely, without, expectation of get
ting it back. I : .

LOS ANGELES, April 24.â The Democ
racy at this end of the State is to be re
organized and the process is to begin
with Los Angeles County. The big north
ern party leaders have selected for the
task John "W. Mitchell. An important con
ference was held in San Francisco last
week, to which Mr. Mitchell was invited.
He was asked If he could not become a
member of the party's State Central Com
mittee at large to succeed the late Sena
tor Stephen M. White. Mr. Mitchell took
the proposition under advisement and to
day, before he had an opportunity to
signify an acceptance, the appointment
reached him by mail. â¢_Â¦â¢ *
The new deal will have a far-reaching
effect upon the party, especially upon its
local organization. It means that a de
termined effort is to be made to swing the
State into line three years hence for David
Bennett Hill. Â¦
"There is a future ahead for the Demo
cratic party of this city, county and
State and for the country at large," rer
marked Mitchell to-day, "and victory can
be won all along the line in California
next year. The party throughout the
State is to be reorganized and whipped
into a thorough lighting machine and I
shall do my small share toward bringing
order out of chaos If I finally conclude to
gro back actively into harness
"There -will be no more aueer alliances
with other forces that are not In real sym
pathy with Democratic principles if I can
prevent it," added Mr. Mitchell, "and you
may say it as broadly as you please that
my choice for the Presidential nomina
tion is David Bennett Hill of New York."
John \V. Mitchell is one of the best
known Democrats in the State. - He is ag
gressive and outspoken to a fault, a fact
that led to his temporary political undo
ing in the campaign four years, -ago. Mr.
Mitchell's appointment was largely due
to the efforts of Mayor M. P.^Snyder,
ex-State Senator R. F. del Valle and I. B.
Dockweiller. all of whom joined: in their
demands that he be named as the succes
sor to the late Stenhen M. White.

Special Utepatch to The Call.
BERLIN, April 24.â The Berliner Tage
blatt's correspondent In St. Petersburg
sends the following telegram regarding
M. Delcasse's mission to the Russian
capital: The dual alliance to-day is clos
er than ever. The visit of the French
Minister of Foreign Affairs took place at
the express desire of the Czar, which his
Majesty, intimated to Paris through the
French Embassador here. Marquis de
ilontebello, at the same time expressing
regret that he was unable to visit Paris
last autumn.
â¢M. Delcasse has given assurances at
St. Petersburg that the Waldeck-Rous
se&u ministry, -with which the Russians
Government was not always content, will
6tafcd fast by the dual alliance. The situ
ation in China, which Count Lamsdorff
has of late described as . very serious,
formed the chief subject of his confer
ences with M. Delcasse. According to the
Russian view. France has not shown her
solidarity with . Russia energetically
enough. Russian diplomatists are more
than ever convinced that Germany
brought about certain things in China,
probably with a secret arriere-pensee of
immobilizing Russia In the far East and
by attracting her attention from the
Orient.
. To discover the best , means of putting
an end to Chinese "adventure" Is the chief
aim of the Interviews between M. Â¦ Del
carse and Count Lamsdorft*. Russia con
siders that the Macedonia question is very
disquieting and is preparing a firm basis
for common action by Russia and France
in the Balkans. M. de Wltte has also
taken advantage of the opportunity af
forded by. M, Delcasse's visit to treat for
closer economic and industrial relations
in view of a probable tariff war between
Germany and Russia.

The Germans have been ordered back

havior for the last week or so has caused
great indignation in Peking, not only
among the Chinese, but among the.for
eigners as well. Carts, horses, mules and
ponies have been impressed for transpor
tation purposes, coolies have been made
to work for nothing, and even educated
Chinese have been impressed. A coo
tractor working- for an American quarter
master was impressed while at work and

when 662,000 shares of the common stock

hands. .
"Never before were there such large sales
In a single stock. It means that Hill's
Burlington deal has completely changed
the complexion of the railroad situation,
carrying with it the possibility of a rail
road from. New York to San Francisco.
The Union Pacific Is the missing link In
any railroad chain which may be
stretched between the two oceans. Â¦
It means, too. that William K. Vander
bilt has revived the old-time dream of be
ing the greatest railroad man of this
famous railroad family and making him
self famous as the Vanderbilt that
planned and controlled the line whose ter
minals should be in sight of Sandy Hook
and the Golden Gate. The buying was
attributed to persons associated with the
Vanderbilts and to what is known as the
Harriman syndicate. Harriman la now
about to bring to light his conception of a
scheme whereby the Union Pacific, the

DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.
The New IHscovery for Catarrh. Seems
to Possess Remarkable
Merit.
- A new catarrh cure has recently - ap-
peared, which so far as tested has been
remarkably successful in curing all forms
of catarrh, whether in the head, throat,
bronchial tubes, or in stomach and liver.
The remedy Is in tablet form, pleasant
and convenient to take and no special
secrecy is maintained as to what it con-
tains, the tablet being a scientific combi-
nation of Guaiacol. Eucalyptol, Sangulna-
ria, Hydrastln and similar valuable and
harmless antiseptics. .
This safe and effective catarrh cure may
be found at any drug store under name
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
"Whether the catarrh Is located in the
nose, throat, bronchial tubes or stomach,-
the tablets seem to act with equal suc-
cess, removing the stuffy feeling in head,
and nose, clearing the mucous membrane
of throat and trachae from catarrhal se-
cretions, which cause the tickling, cough-
ing, hawking and gagging so annoying to
every catarrh sufferer.
Nasal catarrh generally leads to ulcera-
tlon. in some cases to. such an extent as
to destroy the nose entirely and in many
old cases of catarrh the bones of the head
become diseased. Nasal catarrh gradually
extends to the. throat and bronchial tubes
and very often to the stomach, causing
that very obstinate, trouble, catarrh of
the Stomach. .-.â¢Â¦Â¦â¢ > ;Â¦ â¢Â¦â
Catarrh is a systemic poison, inherent In
Â¦the. blood, and local, washes, douches
salves. Inhalers and sprays can -have no
effect â¢ on the real cause of the disease.
An internal remedy which acts upon the
blood is the only rational treatment and
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets i9 the safest of
all internal remedies as well aa the most
convenient and satisfactory from a medi-
cal standpoint.
Dr. Eaton recently stated that he had
successfully used Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets In old chronic cases, even where, ul-
ceratlon had extended so, far as to destroy
the septum of the noae. He says: "lam
pleasantly surprised almost every day
by the^ excellent results from Stuart's
Catarrh /Tablets. It is remarkable how
effectually they remove the excessive se-
cretion and bring about a healthy condi-
tion of the mucous -membranes of the
nose, throat and stomach." ~

the tablets at -50 cents, and a little book

Although the 1 Monterey oil district is
comparatively new, claim-jumping has al
ready been reported. In this immediate
district one company is preparing to de
velop a quarter section of land taken up
by a San Francisco ! syndicate. As the
latter corporation is strong enough to
fight its own battles, trouble is likely to
ensue when it is ready to put its drills at
work. One" or. two other scattering cases
of claim-jumping are reported.
This is the programme as given out by
the men who are endeavoring to get oil
promoters interested in the vigilante
proposition. It is likely that they will
have little trouble in interesting legiti
mate claim-holders. Already a sort of
vigilante organization exists in Kern
County, but it has as its basis simply the
unwritten law of the oil region and has
not come into evidence except in the re
cent Midway affair. A more general or
ganization, whose existence and power
would be recognized, would afford . a
powei'ful medium of protection for poor
claim-owners , against the sending in of
armed ruffians to seize their holdingsâ a
practice not infrequently followed by
powerful corporations.
SAN ARDO, April 24.â As an outgrowth,
probably, of the recent ' trouble in the
Midway oil district of Kern County, end
ing in the battle last Thursday between
vigilantes and claim- jumpers, in which
two of . . the latter , .were .. . dangerously
wounded, several Kerri County men' are at
work in this vicinity sounding oil men on
a preposition to start a protective organi
zation to embrace the entire oil region in
Central California. The organization is
to be in the nature of a vigilance body,
which shall defend the rights of each in
dividual member. It is proposed that
where a claim^is jumped attomej's for the
vigilantes shall endeavor by peaceable
means to induce the interlopers to. move
on. Should these means fall, others
more drastic will be adopted. Each mem
ber of the organization shall pay into the
treasury a certain prorata, to be used in
the protection of its members individually
and in the fighting of any battles -which
the organization as a whole might find
itself compelled to wage as a result of
the aforesaid drastic measures. ,'Â¦ .

Accusation Against Colonel Wright of Southern Pacific
In the meantime Mrs. Harrison and
Mrs. Moser came over to Tacoma and had
him arrested on a charge of bigamy.
Both women will appear against him at
his trial next month.
Next it was discovered that Sturgeon
had come to Tacoma and was married
under a faJse name and address, giving
his name as S. M. Sturgeon and his resi
dence as Kent. /The wo*.nan victimized
this time was Marie EEteo. They returned
to Seattle and were living together when
tho third wife appeared on the scene. She
had no money to employ attorneys, and
had to accept Sturgeon's statement that
the Idaho marriage was void until an
other attorney told her the Idaho mar
ria;;e was valid.
Oq this discovery Marie Estes promptly
left Sturgeon. . Â¦ Â¦
Sturgeon went to Montana in 1SS3 and
returned with a divorce from his first
wife. Then he remarried Mrs. Harrison
in Washington, which legitimatized the
cnlldren. 'iney lived together until Isa2,
but she claims he treatea her cruelly ana
she left .him again, in tne course of two
or three months he went to SpoKane, ap
plied for a divorce and obtained it by
oefault, on the ground of desertion. Sne
claims she knew nothing about it. She
learned of it afterward and at once at
ia.cke<i the decree on the ground of /raud,
but bturgeon was diplomatic and they
had a settlement. He agreed to let her
have the custody of the little girl if she
would let the aecree alone. Sne signed
a. tuner to that effect.
That night Sturgeon, with the aid of an
cmissarv, stole the children and left the
country- Mrs. Sturgeon resumed her
mciden name of Harrison. She next lo
cated him at Friday Harbor, whence he
went to Seattle. Mrs. Harrison was then
in Montana, but she followed him to Seat
tle. There she found that after Sturgeon
had got the divorce in Spokane he went
to Idaho with Ella Moser, who also had
been granted a divorce within the six
months' preceding, and they were mar
ried. Tnis was in 1892. Then they re
turned to Spokane and lived together at
i'riday Harbor and Seattle until 1899.
The third Mrs. Sturgeon went to Spok
ane for a visit and on her return to Seat
tle found him living with another woman.
He told her the Idaho marriage was void,
because they were married within a
period of six months after procuring a
divorce.

erence in his testimony, is a former asso

Colonel J. B. Wright was asked to-night
if he desired to make any statement with
reference > to < the charge contained â¢ in . the
Interview, with Mayor C!ark:.that he had
been interested In , the poolrooms. Said
Cblonel Wright: '.-Â¦:Â¦
B. W. Cavanaugh was a partner with
Daroux In the poolrooms. % It is expected
that he will be called to the stand to-mor
row and that sensational testimony will
be given by him, but he declines to state
what this will be or to say anything
further than that he will tell all the truth
if called to the stand.
iThe incident before the board of trus
tees to which Clark makes reference in his
statement was when 15. L. Kripp, then an
owner of one of the poolrooms, charged
that Mayor Clark once had an interest
with. him in the poolrooms. At the time
this incident occurred '. Mayor Clark [ was
addressing, public â¢Â¦ meetings and church
congregations upon the evil of the pool
rooms and the necessity of an ordinance
to close them. . . .
During his campaign for the office of
Mayor Clark had the support of J. B
Wright, and this continued, according- to
statements made by Clark, up to the time
when Mayor Clark declined to appoint
Railroad Detective William Ahern Chief
of Police, but gave the position to John
E. Sullivan. The falling out with Wright
and the others over the oil land transac
tion followed.
.1 am not at all surprised that Jack Wright
is now seeking to win his lawsuit by the tes
timony of Â¦ Bart Cavanaugh and Frank Daroux
and that they go Into court prepared to testify
to anything that desires. They seem
to labor under the delusion that they are con
ducting one of Wright's primaries at present
in the Superior- Court, but I am confident that
such instruments used by Wright will be of
no avail to him and his associates. Â¦
The story of Daroux is absurd. The same
sort of thing was endeavored to be stated be
fore the Board of Trustees when I first closed
the poolrooms in this city. I never had any
interest in any poolroom of any sort in the
city of Sacramento I and nobody knows that
better \ than Daroux. M. F. Rowland, who
was a go-between, asked me if I would meet
Cavanaugh and Daroux last July and I told
them, that they could see me at my office at
any time and they met me at the Mayor's
office one* evening last year. It was during
the poolroom i agitation and Cavanaugh and
Daroux begged me at that time not to close
the poolrooms. . They told me that I was In
juring not only them but Colonel Wright, and
that he tadan interest in .the poolrooms; that
while they could go to Sausallto and open
new ones he would be unable to go there. 1
told them then, aa I have always told them,
that the poolrooms in this city would have
to close. That was tne substance of our in
terview.
Mayor Clark was asked by The Call

with reference to the testimony of Da

typewritten statement, as follows:

when he declared that Clark was his part

quently -when he challenged the attorney
to bring Clark into court was decided and
even violently angry. The sensation in
the courtroom was so great that the
bailiff had difficulty in restoring order.
PRINCIPALS IN A SENSATION
AL LAWSUIT AT THE STATE '
CAPITAL.
Some men use Sunday as a sort of
sponge to wipe out the sins they commit
ted during the previous six days.
Senator Ashe was a tenant of Mrs. Bell
on her Beltalne ranch last year. Through
a lawsuit she recovered possession of her
land, alleging 1 that the Senator had not
paid the stipulated rent. He then re
moved his livestock and' personal prop
erty ; to his Kenwood ranch. Mrs. Bell
now claims that he took five horses, -four
head of cattle, two wagons and other
property belonging to her. It is this prop
erty she seeks to recover. Â»
Senator Ashe claims to have bought the
livestock from Mrs.. Mary E. Pleasant,
more familiarly known as "Mammy"
Pleasant, the old negress, who was for
merly a servant in the Bell household.
That Senator Ashe will resist Mrs. Bell
in her attempt to obtain possession of
the property is certain, as he has declined
on a number of occasions to compromise
the case, on the ground tnat Mrs. Bell
has no just claim to the property.
SANTA ROSA, April 24.â Civil action
against State Senator RV Porter Ashe of
San Francisco will . be instituted by Mrs.
Teresa Bell in the Superior Court of this
county on Friday for the recovery of
about $600 worth of personal property. T.

Q. â Your poolrooms did not run,' did they?

The Sacramento Dally Bee closed the pool
rooms. Mr. Clark was my partner in the pool
rooms.
H. W.- Johnsonâ I would like, your Honor, to
send for Clark, so that he may be here.

Q.â What do you call a bookmaker?
A.â Selling pools on horse races.
It was at this point' that the sensational
episode occurred. Hiram W. Johnson, of
counsel for Mayor Clark, angrily took the
witness for cross-examination, and tle
manded:
Q.â Are you friendly to Clark now?
A.â Well. I don't know.
Q. â Well, are you or are you not?
A.â Well. I wouldn't be friendly to a partner
that would double-cross me â no, no!
Q.â You are a good friend of J. B. Wright
though, aren't you?
A.â Well, not particularly friendly.
Q.â You handle his money and do his politics
for him, don't you?
A.â Never handled a dollar of J. B. Wright's
money in my life. Never asked a favor of him
in my life.

Q-â Will you please state all that was said
and who opened the conversation and who took
part In it and what Mr. Clark said?
A.â All that was said at that meetingâ at
that meetinj. sir?
Q.â About this matter; about the sale of his
stocli.
A.â "Well, there was a whole lot of things
said there. Do you want it allâ everything?
The courtâ About this stockâ the sale of this
stock.
A. â Well, after we got through doing our busi
ness (we transacted some business) I became
very friendly with Mr. Clark all at once.
Hadn't been very friendly with him, and I
sa id, "George, 1 am very sorry to see that you
have soldâ to hear that you have sold your
Interest In the Sacramento OH Company "
'â¢Well," he says, "I am glad to get out of it;
I set a price and I have sold, got my money
glad to get outâ tickled to death." I asked
him who he sold it to, and he said he sold it
to a man named Samuels. I don't think I
asked him who Samuels was. He said' that he
had made a good profit on the investment;
that if he made as much on every investment
as he did on that he would be satisfied.
Q.â Was any sum mentioned in that conver
sation?
A.â I don't think so. He asked me if I
had an Interest in the Sacramento Oil Com
pany. I told him yes; that I had 1500 shares
of the Sacramento oil stock. "Well." he said,
"If you get a good price for it get out."
Mr. McEnerneyâ Take the witness.
A.â Yeo, sir.
Q- â Now, during that interview, was there
anything: saidâ you have already stated that
there was something saidâ by Mr. Clark about
the Bale of his stock in the different corpora
tions?
Frank Daroux was placed on the stand
late this afternoon to tell of a conversa
tion had with Clark in April of. last year,
in which Clark had expressed himself as
satisfied with the sale of his share In the
oil lands. Daroux testified that the in
terview occurred in the Mayor's office,
that the appointment was made by B. W.
Cavanaug-h and that -there were present
besides himself and the Mayor, Cava
naugh and Michael Rowland.
The examination of Daroux by Garrett
McEnerney of counsel for the defendants
follows:
The plaintiffs had finished, their case,
their contention being that the fact of
the true value of the land had been with
held from them and that deception had
been practiced upon them. The defense
then sought to prove that the transaction
was a fair one, and that, after selling,
Clark and Booth had expressed satisfac
tion at the profit they had realized from
the eale.

at $100 per acre. It was claimed that two
days prior to the sale oil was struck on
the land, and that it became Immensely
valuable, although these facts, it was al
leged, were concealed from Clark and
Booth. They brought suit in January of
this year to be reinstated as owners with
the several defendants in the oil lands,
alleging, as showing their value, that in a
few months 60,000 barrels of oil had been
taken therefrom, worth $50,000. The suit
has been in. progress in. the Superior Court
for a week, but beyond the prominence
of the principals in the litigation there has
been nothing of an unusual or Interesting
nature until this afternoon.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY,; APRIL 25, 1901.
SACRAMENTO, April 24.â A sensa
tion was sprung in the Clark and
Booth oil land suit in the Superior
Court this afternoon when Frank
Daroux, a local Republican politi
cian and poolroom owner, declared under
oath that Mayor Clark was a partner of
his in the poolroom business. Scarcely
less sensational was the statement of
Mayor Clark to-night that Daroux and
Bart "W. Cavanaugh told him that Colonel
J. B. Wright, one of the defendants in the
oil land case and division superintendent
ol the Southern Pacific Company at this
point, had an interest with them in the
poolrooms. In this statement. Mayor
Clark brands the testimony of Frank
Daroux in relation to his own partnership
with Daroux as absolutely false.
Clark and Booth, who are business part
ners in this city, were interested with D.
W. Carmichael, W. T. Sesnon. J. L. Gil
lis. J. B. Wright, W. E. Knowles, A. J.
Samuel and.B. S. Porter in a large section
of oil land in Kern County. On January

Shouts of encouragement and sympathy
from the lips of fair ones were heard last
evening in the gymnasium of the Olympic
Club during tho progress of the amateur
championship wrestling tournament. The
contests were held in honor of the ladles,
and they filled the gymnasium to over
flowing.
The wrestling contests were highly ex
citing and were greatly enjoyed. Eugene
Van Court refereed the bouts, Fred R.
Butz acted as timer. G. A. Hensley scorer,
and Robert McGibbon announcer. More
than a score of bouts were contested, and
out of the seven championships decided
the Olympic Club wrestlers captured five,
which speaks well for George Miehling.
the club's Instructor. Chris Peterson, a
veritable hercules, defeated W. R. Mc-
Cullugh in the heavyweight division, and
H. M. Platt of the Reliance Athletic Club
defeated- J. C. Kahn of the Multnomah
Athletic Club in the 125-pound class. G.
W. Braun entered in three .classes and
managed to secure first place in the 135
pound and 158-pound classes. He was
thrown cleverly by R. S. Wixon In the
welterweight division. Platt of the Reli
ance essayed- to win out in the 135-pound
class, but Braun proved too much for him.
R. B. Cornell had the hardest work of the
night. He won in the welterweight class
and might have defeated Braun for mid
dleweight honors but for his exhausted
condition. He fainted after hi9 final bout
with his clubmate, but soon revived and
was able to walk out of the ring.

The defendant Is charged under section 415
of the Penal Code with the crime of disturbing
the peace. The evidence shows that the of
fense Â¦ is an aggravated one, viz: using ob
scene language in speaking over tho telephone,
and addressing the same to . a young lady, a
6tranger to the defendant, who happened to
be telephoning" on the . same party line. I
have heard many similar I complaints, and . I
believe that an example should be made of
any individual who is proven guilty of such a
cowardly act. If such practices are not dis
couraged It will be impossible for any . one to
use a telephone without being . subjected to
insult Â¦ from some concealed scoundrel who
feels secure from detection and who delights
in ublng obscene language. This class of of
fenders, and those guilty of similar offenses,
to. wit: I using vile and . obscene 'language on
street cars and in public places in the pres
ence of women, need not expect . rftercy : from
me, I if found guilty. The extreme j penalty in
this case by fine is $90, -and by Imprisonment
ninety days. : I will not allow Â¦ this defendant
to pay a fine, but will sentence him to impris
onment - in the : County Jail for the term of
one month, and I hope i that : after serving: , his
sentence he will see the error of his way. and
that the; example of his punishment will de
ter others from the commission of similar of
fenses. ;'..j â¢ â¢....,-.

Cancilli is employed in his j brother's
fruit store at 160 Fifth street, and on the
night of April 16, while Miss Annie Cas
tro, a dressmaker at 837. Howard street,
was talking over the telephone to her sts
ter on Fell street, Cancilli, whose tele
phone is on the same "party line," chimed
in; and made an insulting proposal to her.
She handed the receiver to her other sis
ter, who was with her, and walked quick
ly to the' fruit store, discovering Cancilli
at the telephone. He had done the same
thing before. Cancilli was convicted and
appeared for sentence yesterday. In sen
tencing- him the Judge said:
Men who use the telephone for the pur
pose of insulting women by Â¦ vulgar and
abusive language had a lesson taug-ht
them yesterday -when Judge Mogan sen

. Great regret -was expressed that C. E.
Maud of the Riverside Polo and Golf Club,
C. E. Orr of the Pasadena Country Club,
and Walter Cosby of the Los Angeles
Country Club, were not' able to play in
the - tournament. Notwithstanding . the
absence of these experts the representa
tives of Southern California did very well
yesterday, taking four out of the six
highest places. H. M. Sears of the Los
Ang?les Country Club turned in. the best
r-core of the dayâ 176, John Lawson's score
being eleven higherâ 187. E..R. Folger of
Oakland handed In a score only one high
er than John Lawson's. Several players
went out to the links quite early in the
morning in the hope of finding a still at
mosphere, but in this they were disap
pointed, for a strong wind blew across the
course all day, being especially cold and
disagreeable in the afternoon. The course
and greens are very fast, the ninth green
being reached in two. several times. On
his third round J. "WV Bryne's second shot

was not quite completed, however, ! as
qualifying scores may be handed in up to
1 p. m.- to-day.' Of the sixteen competi
tors the thirteen first named in the list
given below are practically sure to be
within the charmed circle of sixteen. who
will be qualified to play in the opening
match play round this afternoon. The
last three named, J. S. Cravens, J. J.
Creeks and R. G. Brown, are by no means'
sure of their places, as "Warren; Gregory,
Captain D. J. Rumbaugh and J. H. Mee,
all pf the San Francisco Golf Club, are
aulte likely to beat 210.
Of the members of the San Franciso

play the qualifying round, B. D. Adamson.

The game yesterday attracted scarcely
any spectators, but this is to be attributed

that the real contest had not begun. Some

To-Day's Entries.
Â¦ On Tuesday, in the race won by Bound
lee. Jack Martin and "Ixmgshot" Conley
indulged in a splash of rough riding and
repartee. The pair repeated it in the third
event yesterday, and were cautioned by
the judges that unless it was discontinued
both riders -would be set down.
Track Notes.
LOXG shots in the betting- swept
nearly everything before them at
Tanforan Park yesterday. Had It
not been for the win of Rollick,
outsiders would have had a clean
pcore. The fusillade began with Cousin
Carrie, followed by the victories of Torso
Maid, Beau Ormonde, Doublet and .finally
Matt Hogan. ICash Turner alone remains
to represent the fashionable division of
jockeys and he failed to distinguish him
self particularly. The exceedingly good
card attracted u large attendance.
While the bookmakers made The Fretter
favorite for the free handicap, with his
â¢ 115 pounds in the saddle, the sharpshooters
unloaded on Boau Ormonde, cutting the
j.rjr-e from Vfa to 1 to 13 to 5. Of the other
time starters MacGyle was the only one
conceded a .chance. The pace set in the
race was not a. fast one. and Gouin, on
lieau Ormonde, was in the lead all the
way. stalling- off tho late rush of MacGyle
and winning all out by a neck in 1:48%.
Malay ran third and the favorite last.
Homage, run in her new owner's colors
fcr the first time in the opening live and
a half furlong sprint, a mild favorite In
the betting, nn!s-hed back in the ruck. At
the start Fauntleroy, on the 12 to 7 out
sider. Cousin Carrie, sneaked away in the
lead, beating the second choice. Screen
well take, four lengths at the wire. Jack
Marttn.-on Merida, finished third.
Alexander, the colored rider who rode
the 7 lo 5 favorite. Jarretierre d'Or. for the j
two-year-old tptfnt over four and a half
furlongs, met with a bunch of mishaps.
Soon after the Ftart his mount was cut off
and then, ridden in and out, finished
fourth. Jack Martin made all the run
ning with the 12 to 1 shot Torso Maid, and
in sl fierce three-head drive with Royalty
rind VasaHo was returned the winner. A
lurlong from the f=tand Ransch, astride
Vai-aJlo, was cut off by Royalty or he
would undoubtedly have won.
After many nervous pulsations in the
ring, the betting on the seven-furlong run
for three-year-olds finally resulted in Rol
lick closing a slight favorite over Ada N.
Luck favored ihe former, for he had clear
sailing from the kick-off, and won hand
ily. Ada N was cut off at the start by
Cougar, and then finished a good second.
"Chub" Russell" landed the 8 to 1 shot
Doublet first for the fifth number at six
furlongs. Gibraltar, the favorite, sulked
after running a quarter. Andrattus led
into the stretch, when he was headed by
Uoublet, which horse downed Princess Ti
tania half a length in 1:13%. Tommy But
ler, on the last named filly, met with poor
racing luck in getting cut off, or she would
have been first. ;
Billy Magrane had Matt Hogan fit to go
the Derby route, and the Wagner gelding
defeated a fair bunch of sprinters in the
last event with astonishing ease. Ransch,
who had the leg up, trailed the favorite.
Saintly, into the stretch, and then forging
to the front, scored by over a length.
Show honors fell to Invictus.

like his father, would unite serious duty
with the buoyant spirits of youth.

authorities and clergymen. Emperor Wil
liam and the Crown Prince stood at a

hopes of which he had elven promise as
a youth. The strong arm of the Emperor,
said Rector Lavalette, secured Germany's
frontiers and the German flag waved over
all the seas. Art, science, trade and com
merce flourished under the wise protec

Emperor as a student had won the hearts,
of all so would the Crown Prince soon
learn how truly and warmly all hearts
beat in unison with his.

New Companies Formed.
The Bakersfield California^-, says that
the company that has recently been or
ganized to furnish water to the McKitt
rlck, Sunset and Midway districts Â¦will
have a supply for all those sections. , The
magnitude of the undertaking is indicated
by the fact that the main pipes, if the
entire scheme is carried out, will extend
at least twenty-five miles and the water
will have to be elevated 750 feet.
Two days before the expiration of the option
Bob telegraphed his trusted, brother on the
spot that the deal would be- closed the fol
lowing morning and that he . would telegraph
cash immediately. Alas, for the uncertainties
of fate and human depravity, the money was
never Bent. On the eve before the great event
in the career of Rader brothers,- and -while
faithful Bob lay dreaming vivid golden dreams
in the little out-of-the-way Missouri town, the
cashier bt the only bank in the place was
realizing on the cash on deposit. â¢ Quietly and
without so much as a farewell, he slipped out
of town with something like $60,000 hidden in
a grip. Unfortunately for the would-be in
.vestors and the enterprising Rader brothers,
the cashier never returned, and the residents
of the little Missouri town were forced to face
a financial famine' that put oil speculation
quite out of their reach. Since that eventful
failure the Rader brothers have scratched all
entries to oil propositions, believing their field
is In another direction.
The Los Angeles Times tells a hard luck
story that explains why the Rader broth
ers of Bakersfield failed to go into the oil
business. One of the brothers went to
Missouri -and there found 1-eady 'capital
in the shape of bank deposits to secure
an option on certain lands. The 'Story
continues: ; . . . ' *
Save an Odd Experience.
According to the Santa Paula Chroni
cle, Messrs. Norrls and Newell and their
associates of San Francisco have pur
chased the controlling interest In. the
holdings of the Santa Paula Gravity Oil
Company with land in Timbrel Canyon
and will at once proceed to sink wells. /
Through' the local field yesterday scarcely
anything was being talked of by the producers
aside from the efforts now ' on to bring: the
price of oil to the dollar mark, and the produc
ers seem ready to join with enthusiasm in .the
work. A few of the companies have not been
selling of late on account of the low price,
and a number of other companies are prepar
ing to store their product for a time, there
having grown up Mn the last rew days a gen
eral faith In the advance of price at an early
date. The fact that a number of* companies
have laid their drilling rigs aside will very
soon reduce the production materially through
the regulation shrinkage In each well during
the first few months it is pumped.. V
'.The Los Angeles Herald says that some
of the Los Angeles companies have not
been selling oil lately because of the low
price, and adds: .
The Santa Fe Company will double its
force of drillers in the Kullerton field.

Work in Districts.
The committee ; of the oil producers,
which has been : considering t plans for
some form of co-operation among the va
rious sections and all the owners of the
wells, held another meeting in this city
yesterday afternoon, but the members re
ported that they were not yet in position
to tell what they did.* They are hopeful
that the agreement,' when it is finally
adopted, ' will be what .is needed for the
common protection of the interests of the
oil men of the Â¦ State- and are taking a
good deal of time that the matter may
be considered in all its bearings. While
this Is â¢ going on, a rumor is circulating
in Bakersfleld that a syndicate is forming
to construct a pipe line from the Kern
River district to tide water. "The opera
tors, of the several fields in the county,"
so runs the rumor, "are to be solicited
to agree. to give their business to the lino
In case it is ever laid, the shipping charge
to be 20 cents. In the event that suffi
cient support is guaranteed the laying of
the pipe will begin." "
"The man -with the speculative turn of
mind," says the Los Angeles Times, "will
be given a chance on the floor of the Los
Angeles Stock Exchange. At a meeting
of the membership the open house policy
was adopted, and henceforth margin ac
count trading will afford inducement for
speculative flyers. There was not a dis
senting voice registered against this class
of trading and the plan went through
with a rush. Under the new system brok
ers will be able to trade in. oil stocks by
putting up 10 per cent of their value."

The Speaker replied briefly, thanking
the regents for. their courtesy and promis
ing -that" although he lived a "long dis
tance from the, seatof the war" he would
be as faithful as possible in attendance
and Interest.:- .'Â¦ Â¦
We are glad to welcome you, and hope that
you will take the same deep and affectionate
interest in the affairs of the . university that
your predecessor Â¦ did. .: â¢-, . .
Speaker Pendleton attended the meet
ing and was introduced by Regent Rodg
ers. General Barnes, who was In the
chair, said: .
' I am convinced we ought to follow Director
Campbell's advice. He Is a conservative man
and a very great man, destined to stand at the
head of his profession in this country.
Â¦ The Lick Observatory budget as recom
mended by the committee and president
was adopted. It includes an increase in
the salary of Assistant Astronomer C. D.
Perrine from $1500 to $1600; in that of As
sistant Astronomer R. G. AitlÂ«en from
$l*>00 to $1300; in that of Assistant Astron
omer W H. Wrisht from $1200 to $1300;
the appointment of H. M. Reese, now a
fellow to an instructorship at- $800; the
appointment of R. H. Curtis to the va
cant fellowship .at $600, and the appro
priation of $1000 for the salary of an in
strument maker, instead of tfwo.the usual
appropriation. â¢ â¢
The' new salary list Is $21,440, as against
$21 220 for last year. The salary of an as
tronomer paid Professor Campbell before
his promotion to the directorship, $2400, is
saved by the non-appointment of the as
tronomer.- Director. Campbell's recom
mendation that no new appointments be
made and the salary saved- be devoted to
increase of all salaries to the old scale
was not followed. Regent Barnes said in
this connection: ..', . :-., ..' .
Lick Observatory Budget.
"That involves a. very important ques
tion," Regent Rodgers said. . "I am op
posed to shouldering any greater burden
for the support of the medical college.
If the department is necessary, let. it be
established, so that the work shall be
done as a part of the university, curricu
lum, and not in the medical college."
Regent Hough ton said there would not
be a voice raised against Presiuent
"Wheeler's recommendation if it were not
for the impression that it would be the
entering wedee to saddle the entire ex
pense of the support of the affiliated col
leges upon the university funds.
On motion of Regent Rodgfers, the rec
ommendation was referred to the com
mittee on the status of the medical de
partment to report at the . May meeting
some plan by which the' proposed depart
ment of anatomy might be established at
Berkeley rather than at the medical col
lege.
Among those to whom the criticisms by
the regents would apply are the follow
ing "named: Dr. John M. "Williamson,
president of the Board of 'Health, who
is professor of anatomy and lecturer on
surgery in the medical college; Dr. Louis
Bazet, police surgeon and professor of
gynecology: Dr. T. B. "W. Leland, Coro
ner and professor of .internal medicine,
and Dr.-Washlngton Dodge, Assessor and
professor of therapeutics.
The medical college was brought Into
the line of fire by President Wheeler's
recommendation that a department of
anatomy be established, to consist of a
professor on a salary of ?3000 or $3500 and
probably two assistants on salaries that
would bring the cost of the department
up to $5000 per year. President Wheeler
said that the department of physiology
in the university was already on a good
footing, and pathology was well cared for
in the medical department. To lock .this
work together and give proper scientific
foundation for medical education . a de
partment of anatomy should be estab
lished. ,
Questions by Regent Rodgers developed
the fact that for the present the work
of the professor of anatomy would have
to be done at the medical college.
Professors in Hine of Fire.
Regent "Waymire suggested that the res
olution might apply to such cases as that
of Professor Moses, who Is on leave of
absence, serving as a member of the
Philippine I Commission. The resolution
was referred to a committee consisting
of Regents Waymire, Budd and Foster,
to report at the May meeting upon Its
scope and application;- - .-Â¦ .... ..
It is the duty of the regents to give loyal
support to the medical college and to attempt
the correction of any faults that may^axist in
It along certain lines. Some of its professors
have used their names In connection with po
litical parties and political- offices. I do not
believe that any of them should be connected
in any such manner with any political party.
I have heard it said that the medical college
was weak and that the weakness was due to
the professors. We are supposed now to pass
upon the qualifications of professors In that
department, and if we are to make the medical
college a credit to the State and the university
the sooner we start to clean out the stables the
better.
Mr. Foster said in this connection
Resolved. That the professors of the uni
versity shall hold no office which shall violate
or tend to violate the above provision of the
constitution, or which shall be inconsistent
with the efficient prosecution of their duties
as such professors or shall be prejudicial to the
best interests of the university.
Whereas, The constitution of the State of
California provides that the Unlvarslty of Cali
fornia "shall be entirely Independent of all
political or sectarian influence, and kept free
therefrom, in the administration of its affairs."
The resolution offered by Regent Foster
was as follows: .
Political Offices Tabooed.
I am pleased to know that President Gllman
when he took hold of the University of Cali
fornia saw the need for better medical educa
tion, as I do now. Â¦:. He realized his ideals, but
in Baltimore, not here. He did for Johns Hop
kins University what he would have done for
Californiaâ he built up the strongest medical
college in the United States, if not in the
world.
President W^heeler also gently chided
the regents for the silurlanism of their
predecessors. He said:
The trouble has been that the Instruction lit
the medical college has been taken up by prac
titioners to get the entree into wards of hos
pitals and to get their names printed as mem
bers of the medical faculty.
â¢ President Wheeler himself was severe
in his criticism of the department during
the afternoon-. He was speaking of the
need of the State for better education in
medicine and of his desire to strengthen
the scientific work in the university and
the curriculum and instruction of the
medical college. In the course of his re
marks he said:
., A recommendation by President "Wheel
er for the establishment of a department
of anatomy was refused Immediate adop
tion until it should he assured that the
work of the professor would not be der
voted to the medical college. A resolu
tion offered by Regent A. "WV Foster and
directed against these same members of
the medical faculty who have political
ambitions was referred to a committee
instead of being immediately adopted only
because there was fear that it might be
too broad in its application.
The medical department of the Univer
sity of California was under fire at the
meeting of the Board of Regents yester
day afternoon. There was plenty of criti
cism for the affiliated college, Its stand
ards and the attitude of some of Its "po
litical professors," and no regent raised
his voice in defense of the assailed school.

A suggestion of the American Bureau of Statistics
that, an effort be made to promote American Â¦ com
merce by means of a floating exposition of American
products has been warmly taken *up, and it is now
announced that such an exhibit will Soon be sent out
to make a tour *6i the South American coast and from
thence to' other parts of the world. The idea is not
original with this country, for theGermans have al
ready tried the experiment. It is said an exhibition
of the kind was* organized in Hamburg two years ago,
and. the results were in' excess, of .the most sanguine
expectations. The total cost of the enterprise was
about $200,000 and the' trade resulting from it amount
ed to about $5^230,000. With such an illustration of
the effectiveness of the scheme, it is hardly likely
enterprising Americans will be slow to adopt it.
No plan -of action proposed m the discussion has
received more general. approval, than that of Dr;
Henry Shaw, and it is probable that it will, be vir
tually adopted should the State.- decide to . assume
control.' The plan is thus stated by. Dr. .Shaw, him
self: "If the State owned four small farmsâ say at
Middieboro. Wilmingto::, Sterling and Chesterfield,
there would be few plates which would not'be within
thirty. miles of one of them, and all. except Chester
f.cld. would be within easy railroad communication
\vilh all surrounding' 1 territory. In each of them a
small farm might be br-ught. and its buildings,, put in
condition to receive travelers. Let every person going
from place to place without definite destination, if
needing or asking relief, be sent at the expense of the
While the British are rejoicing over that unex
pected ray of brightness in the general gloom caused
by the war and diminishing trade with increasing
taxes, the more thickly settled. States of our own
country are finding the iramp problem more vexatious
thÂ«-n ever. In Massachusetts .the evil has become, so
great the relief bfficeis of the commonwealth are
seeking to provide a better* system of dealing with
it. At the present time many Massachusetts- munici
palities furnish food and lodging- for tramps,~but at
the same time compel those who apply to do a cer
tain amount of work by way of compensation. ' The
plan is not' adequate to the requirements of the
problem, because some communities do not provide
such homes for tramp;, nor in any â¢ way enforce the
general regulations -concerning vagrancy. It. is now
proposed that the- State shall deal directly with the
subject, instead of leaving- it to local authorities, and
to effext that end a campaign of 'education has. been
btarim.
The Westminster Gazette in commenting upon the
decline says it is "so remarkable, indeed, that if the
numbers decrease to the same extent during the next
for.i years the workhouses in the eastern counties ma?
shut up their casual wards, for there will be no tramps
left to use them. The figures showing the number
of casuals relieved in the different unions have just
been compiled by the poor-law inspector for the East
ern District. In Norfolk 29,037 casuals were reported
hy the different unions in 1897. In the following year
this dropped to 24,128; in 1899 it went down to 15,095,
and last year it was only 9739-Hust a thir'd of what it
W3S four years ago. The decrease is spread over every
union in the county. In Suffolk the figures for the
four 3'ears beginning with 1897 are: 23,903; 22,385,
17,655 and 12,838. Here the decrease is not quite so
great as in Norfolk, -but it is very nearly half. < Evi
dently the tramp is becoming scarcer each year." -
BRITISH sociologists are delighted, but at the
same time puzzled, by the remarkable decrease
in vagrancy that has taken place in Great Brit
ain during the last four years. There appears' to be
iic self-evident explanation of the decline, but 'of the
fact there is no doubt whatever. It is made clear
by reports from all parts of the country, and particu
liuly from the eastern counties, where the tramp evil
has in former years been most notable.
THE TRAMP PROBLEM
A local attorney has announce^ to the Federal
court that he will prova that a conspiracy exists . to
keep Chinese but of this' country. The lawyer appears
to have undertaken a r?sk which for others would be
as simple as it is easy. Everybody, having at heart the
welfare of the city is in the conspiracy.
LAST year was a Mine of violence and disaster on
the arid granges. As their use in common as
part of the public domain progressively de
stroys the feed, the contention over what is left grows
more fierce. As the fo-age decreases the moisture
goes with it. and increasing aridity renders the region
less fit for agricultural settlement, and the demand
for Government aid for irrigation grows more per
sistent...
The forces which made the last a season of blood
shed are already in the field. A month ago cattle
rr<en with Winchesters were patrolling -a frontier of
forty miles in Western Colorado to keep out hun
dreds cf thousands of sheep, which had eaten up the
r^r.ge in Utah, and were driven to repeat the destruc
tive operation in the adjoining State. Within the last
ten days a dead line bas been established in Wyo
ming, and those who patrol it warn intruders that
death i;; the penalty for crossing it with stock. In the
sn me State thousands of animals have died in the last
month. because ovcrstDcking the free range has de
stroyed the feed and ibi stock starves and dies in its
tmck^.
The casualties in the range battles last year wer;
the most numerous in the history of the frontier, but
wii! be greatly exceeded this year.
It may not be complimentary to the intelligence of
the American people that they seem indifferent to
the useless destruction of the sole value of the graz
ing country, and as- a result suffer such an advance
in the price of beef tli-it it is gradually disappearing
ficm their tables. At the same time that they are
ivtfncjsing the passing of that food beyond the reach
of many purses it is proposed to tax thtm by appro
pi iatior.s in the river and harbor bill to irrigate lands
mnde increasingly arid by the wasteful policy which
h:is increased the cost of their beef supply.
Protecting the ranges by leasing them to their
users would restore thcii forage, compel 'those who
profit by it to pay foÂ»" its use; would restore beef
to tabics on which its <ost is making it a rarity, an 1
would furnish ample wvns to provide public irrigi
tion without further burdening the taxpayer by Con
gressional appropriation 1 :.. The question is not sec
tional to the arid region. It is a national question.
No national question is more important than one
which concerns a necessary food supply, the protec-,
tion of public property, the extension of the arei
occupied by productive agriculture,- and; the conser
vation of crder, -by substituting, law. for lawlessness
over a vast region. When these four objects can be
accomplished by one simple act of legislation there
should be intelligence enough somewhere in the
country to frame such an act and reason enough in
the Government to m?.ke it the" law.
Ir the arid West are many large Indian reservations.
They are of the same character and capacity for stock
rarges as the region in which they are located. The
Government is charge 1 with their care and preserva
tion. It is leasing the:n as ranges to stock men. The
leaseholders are restricted against overstocking, and
the destruction of the forage is thereby prevented.
The result is that the reservation ranges are con
stantly increasing in value and are real oases in the
blear desert around them, which is exactly the same
kind of land and under the same climatic conditions.
This object lesson teaches the dullest that, outside the
reservations, the same policy will produce the sams
dotirable results.
The income. of the Icar.es on the reservations goes
to the Indians, as owncs of the domain, and may Jic
applied to irrigation \vh: n possible on their lands. It
p: elects them from the former lawless invasion cf
tiuir reservations by stock men. and puts an end to
tbe frequent combats between the invaders them-
Srl\CS.
So it will bf seen tits whole leasehold -policy, with
all its benefits, is already operated' by the Govern
ment for the benefit of the Indians.- What possihle,
reasonable, impressive objection can be made to it?
extension to the whole grazing region on the public
domain, which is the property of all the people of
tbu country?
BATTLE FOR THE RANGE.
BOSS CROKER, finding himself in control of
the Democratic party of' New York on the
eve of the Presidential election, did not hesi
tate to use his power t>'the uttermost for the purpose
ai crushing David Bennett Hill. Doubtless the Tam
many boss believed. he could drive Hill out of poli
tics altogether and get rid of him forever. Croker
has now an opportunity to meditate upon the vanity
of revenge and the" impolicy of hitting a man when
lie is down. Tammany is in sore straits, and Hiil,
emerging from the retirement of Wolfe'rt's Roost, has
taken to the warpath with a scalping-knife as keen as
a razor and as big as a scythe.
There was recently organized at Carnegie Hall in
New York a political faction which took to itself the
title, "The Greater New York Democracy." We learn
that the floor of the hall has a seating capacity of
1000, and every seat was occupied. Moreover, the
tiers of boxes above v wcre also filled. Nor was it a
casual gathering of idle meh brought in from . the
streets by the attractions of a brass band and the ex
pectation of hearing red-hot speeches. It was really
a notable gathering, and included some of the fore
most Democrats of the city.
From first to last it vvas a Hill meeting. Whenever
his name was mentioned it was applauded. Whenever
Croker's name was heard it was hissed. The burden
of the speeches was the necessity for reorganizing the
Democracy of New York and the overthrow of Tarn-'
many Hall. One of the principal speakers, Joseph
F. Daly, a former Justice % of the Supreme Court, 111
urging Democrats of .conscience and intelligence to
break away from Tammany, asked: "How can men
lay their heads upon their pillows after thanking God
for the purity of their homes and the innocence of
their children and forget that the political institution
they support with their votes is filling the streets with
outcasts, the penitentiary with criminals and paupers'
graves with victims â victims once as pure as the
child at its mother's knee?"
As an expression of its purpose the organization
adopted resolutions declaring Tammany Hall respon
sible for existing abuses in the administration, of city :
arfairs, that its permanent overthrow is an essential
prerequisite to the success of any attempt to secure
better local government, and pledging the organiza
tion to oppose the election of any candidates at -the
coming municipal election "nominated by the so
called Democratic city ?nd county conventions to be
held under the auspices of Tammany Hall." ;
In addition to the resolutions there was adopted an
address charging that New York is suffering from
"vile misrule and degradation," that the present city
administration has perverted the functions of munici
pal government "not only to establish a nursery and
asylum for a horde of political camp followers who
prey upon the taxpayers but to foster a system of ex
acting seÂ«ret revenue through a loathsome covenant
with crime." j It says that under Tammany rule there
has been a tremendous increase in the municipal ex
pense's amountingHo $2S,ooo,ooo in three years, while
the real estate valuations have been increased by
$743,000,000. The address contains this sentence:
"Worse and more intolerable than this burden of
crushing taxes is the degradation/ the infamy, which
brings a sense of shame to every reputable citizen of
New York. This city, instead of shedding its luster
abroad, stands forth, to-day in glaring discredit as the
shelter and victim of the most depraved and mer
cenary government in the civilized world."
Among other things the address demands the "elec
tion of a Mayor whose conscience cannot be refrig
eiated," and; when that was read the applause was
tumultuous. Mr. Croker will take notice that David
Bennett Hill. is still alive, and kicking. " .' .

The Call does not bold itseir responsible for
the opinions pablished in this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest.
Â¦ To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I take
It from your recent oditoriala that you have
become an outspoken and energetic opponent of
municipal ownership ot public utilities In gen
eral and In San Francisco in particular, never
theless* the fairness with which you treat the
subject encourages me once more to trespass
upon your attention. la the communication
from me which you published on April 13
statistics were presented which show that
water supplied by municipal ownership la thÂ«
United States averages 40 per cent cheaper
than that supplied by private corporsXions. and
that of the fifty larseat cities In the United
States only nine have private- ownership of
their water supplies.
You argua against the force of these facts
by saying that the water supplies of Chicago,
Philadelphia. New York and Beaton are bad
during portions of the year. As you know
Chicago has recently spent a yreat many mil
lions of dollars in constructing a draina**
canal by which the sewage of the city will
be diverted from Lake Michigan Into the Illi
nois River and finally to tbe Mississippi. As
soon Â»3 this was even partially accomplished
typhoid fever in Chicago showed a remarkable
decrease, thus proving that the sewaffe which
formerly went Into Lake Michigan and polluted
the water supply was rtlrectly responsible- for
the large number of case* ot typhoid fever la
the city. . '
Tcu say that the water supply of Philadel
phia is bad, but that ctty baa recently ap
propriated *12.00O>00O for a complete filter sys
tem to remedy the defect. Â¦ We find the dues
of Chicago and Philadelphia spending million,*
of dollars to purify their water system, What
is the Sprlnar Valley Water Works doing In
San Francisco? The only one. of the ten largest
cities In the United States that Is supplied by
a prlvata corporation?
What Is the death rate in San Francisco, as
compared with Chicago. Philadelphia, NÂ«w
York and Boston, whose water supplies you say
are bad, and what Is the rate of deatha from,
typhoid fever in thoae several cities as com
pared with San Franci3co? The Oakland En
quirer presents these figures: In San Fran
cisco the death rate Is 20.73 In each thousand
cf population: in New York It Is 13.01; la
Chicago. 13.01; In Philadelphia. 13.9Â«; In Boa
ton, 19.41. In San Francisco the percentage of
deaths from typhoid fever Is 2.48. while in New
York it is .082; In Chicago. 1.73: In Philadel
phia, 3.S6; In Boston. 1.4S. In other words the
death rate Is higher in San Francisco, whoea
water Is supplied by a private corporation,
than it is in those cities whose water supply
you condemn, and the death rate from typhoid
fever is likewise higher In San Francisco as
compared with the cities wnoee water supply
you condemn except In Philadelphia, and la
that city a perfect system of filtration is now
being constructed.
Whatever the death rate In the cttles whose
water supply you condemn may be the con
ditions are far worse in Sari Francisco, whose
water supply is controlled by a private cor
poration. If the argument is worth anything
It proves that private ownership is bad as com
pared with public ownership.
I In your editorial of April 23 you say a
municipal plant pays no taxes, therefore the
share which It should pay Is borne by other
property and Is added to the taxpayers* bur
dens. This is an argument which Mr. Symmea
advanced in the recent debate on municipal
ownership at the banquet of tbe Merchants'
Association of this city, but It is entirely
groundless. The people of the city and county
of> San Francisco pay the taxes of "the Spring
Valley Water Company at the present time.
Under private ownership it is held that the
water company is entitled to receive first its
taxes and operating expenses and then a
reasonable return upon the actual value of Its
property used In supplying water to the mu
nicipality. The Sprins Valley Water Com
pany's taxes for the coming year will be flSt*
t'CO, almost all of which will be paid in San
Francisco. Of this about one-third goes to the
State and two-thirds Into the city treasury.
Under municipal ownership the taxes paid to
the State would be saved entirely, while the
burden of the municipal taxes would remain
where It is now â on the rate-payers of the city.
'Municipal ownership therefore represents a
saving of the State taxes, and the municipal
taxes will continue to be paid by the people
vof the city.
' You also say "to put a municipal plant In
condition for comparison with one In private
or municipal ownership it must be charged
â¢ â¢ * with interest on the cost'ef the plant."
This is always dene, but to the disadvantage
of private ownership. The city of San Fran
cisco . can borrow monty at 3 per cent, but .
we pay the Spring Valley Water Works 5
! per cent on the value ot the . property ; henea
municipal ownership would represent a savin*;
of 2 per cent in interest. This Is one of. the
1 strongest Â¦ arguments In favor of municipal
ownership of the wate;- supply of San Fran
cisco.
1 You also say that the municipal plant must
"be made equal to the private plant by using
the same filtering and other devices to make
the same potable." As we have seen the death
rate is less in the citie.. under municipal owner
ship than in San Francisco and yet those
cities are using every endeavor trf benefit their
water supply by filtration and other devices.
The water used in San Francisco is not filtered. Â¦
however, and there is no way that the Spring
Valley Water "Works can bÂ» made to filter Us
supply and thus assist in lessening the largo
death rate In San Francisco and the large list
of casualties from typhoid fever.
To recapitulate: The Call argues that under
municipal ownership the large cities of th*Â»
country have poorer water: they lose the taxes
which private plants would pay; Interest on
the cost of public plants is not regarded, and
public plants are obliged to put in filtration
systems In order to make the water safe. AÂ«
a matter of fact the death rate In San Fran
cisco is higher than In any of the large cities
owning their own water supplies; the death
/ate from typhoid fever Is higher in San Fran
cisco than In any large city owning Its own
water supply except Philadelphia: the State
taxes on Spring Valley Water Works would
be paved under municipal ownership and the
burden of the rnuniclnal taxes would remain
the same as at present: the city can borrow
money for 2 per cent less than we now pay
to the Spring Valley Water Company, effecting
a saving of nearly &GO.00O a year, and the
Sprinz Valley Water Works does not have
any filtration system and cannot be made to
put one In, however 'desirable - lt may be to
have our water filtered. The one way to Im
prove our water system is by municipal owner-'
ship, and under municipal ownership we could
have an unlimited supply of water from the
Sierras, than which there Is no better la tha
world. Yours truly,

AN ADVOCACY
OF MUNICIPAL
OWNERSHIP
Consumptives Can Recover Anywhere
Heretofore it has been considered neces
sary to send the patient to the Klviera, to
the Aips, to the Black Forest, to Califor
nia or to Colorado. Many physicians
practicing at these so-called wonderful
climate cures deluded themselves into be
lieving their particular climate necessary.
The time is nearly past, however, when
the climate enthusiast will have the tem
erity to rise in a medical meeting and
proclaim any one section the sole place
m which consumptives can recover, and
tho sooner the poor consumptive knows
this the better for him and his family,
and, too, for his community. I know that
the arid . West, that high mesa land
stretching for hundreds of miles through
Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, a small
strip of Western Texas, and away into
old Mexico, is undoubtedly the best for
the average consumptive, but the poor
man cannot go to health resorts, nor. can
he well change his environment. Just
think of the good that would result not
alone to the individual, but to society at
large, if such a person could only know
and have faith to believe that.it is possi
ble for him to recover in his own city,
be that in Maine or Oregon, California or
Florida, Louisiana or Ohio. I say, possi
ble to recover, and it must be thoroughly
understood that what is claimed is that
he can .recover, if he will faithfully live
in the open airâ in sleet, snow, wind or
rain â yes, even in the fogs around Lon
don. \
I firmly believe that if the diagnosis is
made early, in the first stage, and /the
patients are sent constantly into the open
air in all kinds of weather, a large per
centage, over half anyway, will be per
manently cured, while many other cases
will be arrested. No one must be misled
by this statement. The diagnosis must
bo early. The patient must know his con
dition-before he has been run down by
fever and has lost his appetite, strength
and weight. Whenever one. has a cough
with expectoration and his . cough â¢ lasts
longer than a few" days his case requires
ihe immediate care of a competent physi
cian. It is in such cases that a patient
may and probably will recover by tbe
â¢ outdoor treatment, no matter in what city
ho stays. If the case has advanced be
yond the first' stage it is possible to ar
rest it and, in a few Instances, cure it
without the necessity of going away from
home. . - Â¦.Â¦ â¢"
Patients That Have Recovered.
What I say must be accepted as a firm
conviction and as free from special in
terest in any locality, for the changes in
the Government service have taken me
into Â¦ nearly every section of the United
States. In all these places I saw the con
sumptive sailor because I had to, for he
was my patient. I also made It a point
to see the native consumptive in his home'
and in his â¢ hospital. I know of consump
tives who are still living after ten, fifteen,
twenty and in one case forty years of
suffering and struggle in unfavorable cli
mates. . These, however, were- persons
with indomitable will power. I know
cases which have recovered in Chicago
and St. Louis. .
'Â¦ From a time in the remote past con
sumptives have died by hundreds of thou
sands every year. Great men and women
and even kings have given their lives to
the study of the disease, and this slow
but steady evolution from the mere
physic-giver to the seeker after cause and
effect haa brought about a united move
ment among medical men throughout the
world. The result proves againthat when
once the composite medical mind becomes
fixed upon what is thought to be a right
principle, something wonderful must hap
pen for the benefit of mankind. The med
ical man has said that the filthy.tene
ment death traps, which are breeders of
tuberculosis, must go; - that the spitting
nuisance must cease and that' con
sumption must be stamped out. Already
hundreds of old buildings in London, Ber
lin, Paris, Philadelphia and New York,
which were known to be badly infected
with tuberculosis, have been pulled down
and replaced with good buildings, because
of the nressure brought to bear on mu
nicipal authorities to remedy the evil.
The movement for the better housing x>t
the poor has spread over the entire, world,
even to Japan. It has been shown that
in nearly the same proportion as the poor
are housed In well lighted and well ven
tilated quarters, where there is abundanc?
of fresh air and life-giving: sunshine, does
the percentage of deaths -from consump
tion drop off. This is not hard to under
stand, if one will but recall that domestic
animals do not thrive in the dark and
dampness, s ;Â¦â¢..>/.".-Â¦Â¦?
Need of Awakened Public Sentiment.
It is estimated that 120,000 people die in
the United States every year from con
sumption. ' If the same number of persons
who died last year in any American city
from consumption were to die In that city
next year from - smallpox, yellow fever,
cholera or plague panic would follow. Let
me put this a " little more forcibly. In
the home of yellow fever, whence we de
rive nearly all our epidemics, viz., Ha
vana, a thousand inhabitants died of yel
low fever from 1890 to 1894. To combat
this it cost the United States many thou
sands of dollars annually to keep a corps
of marine hospital officers, with their
thorough equipment, always at work in
preventing panic in the United States.
Bear In' mind the horror occasioned, by
yellow fever and then make a mental note
of this: In this same city of Havana, in
the same yearsâ 1890-1894â there were 7000
deaths from consumption. . Yet the public
remains indifferent to the" insidious'dan
gers of tuberculosis. Zc.is high time that
such ruthless annual slaughter sutruld
cease. There are many reasons for this
condition, some of which are not yet fully
understood, t even by the .-medical profes
sion, but for our purpose we may say that
it is mainly due to the fact that the aver
age man is careless in the habit of spit
tingâcareless everywhere; in the club, in
the street cars. In the railway station. ! '
To try to check, the "spread of the dis
ease .societies have been formed .which,
with State, municipal and philanthropic
donations, have built sanatoria and in-"
duced : hundreds 'to go to â¢ these places,
where they are taught how to cure them- |
selves and prevent the spread of the tils- !
ease to others. The city of Chicago early
undertook.. to care for. the consumptive
poor Â¦ in better auarters than the county
hospital by erecting buildings especially
for: this disease at Dunning. For many
years Thiladelphia has cared for many
sufferers from this malady and there are'
hundreds of men and. women now earning
a living in .that city who have recovered I
or had the disease arrested' in places of I
fresh-air treatment right In3ide the city
limits. With these home sanatoria in one's
own city or near- by -many, homes have
been kept intact -and the family earnings
have gone on; If every good citizen would
begin at once to talk for more light, more
air, more sunshine, better housing of the
poor. and the immediate, care- of the-con
sumptive in sanatoria laws could soon be
enacted which .would restore to every man
his birthright of fresh air and sunshine.
Much of the iWhitechapel district of Lori-
Frcm time immemorial it has been
known that consumptives get well in cer
tain climates. In those long-ago days, an
equable climate, such as Italy possesses,
was considered necessary. Of course, we
now know that warm climates are not
absolutely essential to a. cure, and yet it
was because of this very belief that cli
mate-cure .came to be well known before
the present time. In" a Â¦warm climate, the
consumptive could be out of doors "all the
time" without discomfort, and he very
soon learned that this was best for him,
thus being misled into the belief that that
particular place and climate had some
miraculous power to recuperate his fail
ing health. Camping expeditions, long
voyages 'in open boats, and other out-of
door exercises, helped to raise the ques
tion to a scientific level. The greatest
drawback in, the light against "the great
white plague," tuberculosis, has been the
fact that the niedical profession, as well
as the laity, believed superstltiously in the
fetich of a certain "place which alone had
wonderful powers to heal.

Proper Sanatorium Treatment.
In all parts of the country the sanato
rium treatment of consumption is now be
ing considered. These sanatoria are noth
ing more nor less than specially construct
ed houses situated in as favorable local
ities as the environs afford. Here one can
go and live under rigid rules. No claims
are made for any specific benefits except
those derived from fresh air, good, whole
some food and close adherence to the dis
cipline of the place. The patient very soon
learns one thing which aids him material
ly. He learns that many consumptives
recover and that the uatients soon make
ligrht of their troubles and try to help in
every way to regain health. They learn
to keep Quiet when their temperature
ranges above the normal or below it: how
to take chest gymnastics, to aid in ex
panding the diseased and restricted lungs;
how to eat slowly and chew the food well;
how to keep cheerful and not to fret.
Most of all, they learn to toughen them
selves to prevent catching cold and to get
along without being coddled by overanx-
ioua relatives and friends.
I wonder if the consumptive knows now
much good he is doing the community by
going to one of these places? By leaving
his, home he ceases to be a most serious
menace to his own relatives and is indi
rectly benefiting the community at large.
By example he is. aiding in the advance
of sanitary knowledge.
A Great Movetoent Well Under "Way.
In just fifty years' time the sanatorium
movement has received an Impetus that
cannot and must, not be checked. Started
on a small scale at Gorbersdorf by the
illustrious Brehmer, aided by some trust
ing and philanthropic friends, the plan lias
been adopted in nearly every civilized
land. To-day there are hundreds of such
places scattered here and there in Eu
rope, the Americas and Japan.
Â¦ Tuberculosis has spared the rich very
little less than the poor and monev has
lately been forthcoming in enormous sums
for the better care of the consumptive.
The movement is thus not alone due to
philanthropy, but Is one of self-preserva
tion. Of all the gifts in the name of suf
fering humanity I cannot conceive of one
more humane or one indicating more,
sound judgment than the erection of a
sanatorium for the care of the consump
tive poor in one's own community. The
folly of this age of philanthropy lies in
the erection of monster buildings for hos
pitals. The consumptive does not need a
hospital. He needs to be helped into the
open ' air and guided and directed in his
treatment by some one who is thoroughly
acquainted with' all the routine of this
method of cure.
Arid Climate Is Desirable. .
There is another side of this question,
that cannot be ignoredâ viz. : That favor
able climates are desirable, and many
times more beneficial than those places
which we have spoken of above. It is^
useless for medical men in the East to
decry the advantage of the arid West,
and by the arid West I mean Colorado,
Arizona, New. Mexico, a small strip of
Texas near El Paso and the mesa lands
of Old Mexico.. I have seen the consump
tive in nearly every portion of the United
States, and I am sincere in saying that
I. have seen the, mest astonishing results
in this country with some patients, both
in acute 'and In old cases: The improve*
ment was so rapid in some instances that
I would not have believed it if I had not
seen it. I have nothing but a passing in
terest in this western country, but as one
interested only in what is the very best
lor the consumptive, I say to the person
with means: Go to some point in Colo
rado. Arizona, -New Mexico, El Paso or
Old Mexico, just as soon as your disease
is discovered. E>o not be misled by ex
travagant advertisements, for one place
is as coodas another in the sections
named, in so far as climate is concerned.
Do not wait, do not take chances, but go
at once, and, as all patients are benefited
by change of environment, 1 one is more
apt to receive the greatest benefits in the
arid region by going there early. If he
does go under these conditions I believe
that I am safe in saying that he has over
80 per cent of chances for his permanent
recovery. No patient, however, should!
come to this country without the advice
of a physician. There are certain condi
tionsâwell known to medical men, which
would prevent one's coming here.
â¢ Best Place for Consumptives.
If you are able physically and have the
money, there are many places where one
may go and. live comfortably. Of course
Denver and Colorado Springs have the
greatest reputations and most liberal ac
commodations, but scattered throughout
Colorado are many smaller towns where
there are good hotels. Coming south,
there are Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Phoe
nix, Tucson and El Paso, with good hotels
which have been recently improved. There
are many smaller places to which the con
sumptive may go, but in many of them
the food and rooms are poor.
These smaller towns have Just as good
climate as the larger ones, the only dif
ference, so far as the consumptive Is con
cerned, being the lack of accommodations
In the small places. At first it may be
better for one to go to some one of the
larger cities just mentioned and then
change to a smaller town if desired. But
whatever place is chosen, whether in this
almost boundless west or near one's own
home city," let this advice guide you as
the cloud by day and the pillar of flre
by night: Come what may, discourage
ments, backsets, or even hemorrhages, re
solve that you will live steadfastly in the
open air. t '.
1â HERE is growing a great pressure in the South
for the seizure of Cuba. The spirit of Buchanan,
Mason and Slideli, as uttered in the brutal Os
tend manifesto, is abrcad in that section' and >th=
Democratic supporters of Bryan are possessed by it.
it is known that almost all the Democratic Senators
were in 1S98 Cuban- ar-hexationi'sts, and now . they
covertly favor taking the island. The most earnest
arguments in favor of that step appear in the South
ern prcs3. The "solemn duty" part is left to Major
Henry Watterson of the Louisville Courier-Journal. .
.Henry has an inventive imagination. He invented
the Gold Democracy in 1896, and then invented a
reason for going into the Bryan camp in 1900. He
is now inventing reasons for taking Cuba. He ladles
out sentimental loblolly 1 - on that subject as generously
as the stills of his State run bourbon.
He seems never to have heard of the declaration of
war, and if he know of our pledge of abstention from
the sovereignty of Cuba regards it with fides Punka,
and as a very proper promise to be broken. Through
out the South there are many who follow this lead,
and if Cuba hold out until 1904, and the Democratic
party, controlled by the South, get power, Cuba* will
be gobbled with the joyous alacrity and appetite
shown by the python when it swallows a cassowary,
regardless of the consent of the cassowary.
â¢Mr. Watterson recently proclaimed the unalterable
union of destiny between the United States and Cuba,
the same being closer than that between pie and its
crust or sausage and irs case. He said: "The inter
ests of the United States and Cuba are inseparable
The' island must prosper as we prosper, and we must
suffer with it through- maladministration and neglect.
The Cubans are realizing this, and it is not surprising
that the saner minds among them look upon annexa
tion as the perfection of their government."
Upon such rot is faithlessness fed. Cuba has about
as much influence up.on our destiny as a fly on
a steer's horn has upon the export of beef. It is a bit
c: Wattcrsonian grandiloquence, which passes for pro
fbundity in a State where they rotten-egg Carlisle and
make Joe Blackburn Senator.
Cuba affects us. as much and no more than Hayti,
San Domingo, Jamaica and the Carib Keys. The
idea that this great country, capable of producing all
that it consumes and having a surplus large enough to
fr-ed and clothe the world, must suffer whenever a
flea-bitten and fever-plagued island in the tropics has
a fever of revolution or a spasm of murder is pre
posterous.
We join Mexico, with no ninety miles "of water be
tween us. Mexico has chilled and fevered, hungered
and fed, had all colors of fever, and epidemics of
brigandage and vomito, with no effect on our pulse"
or temperature. Canada has had rebellions, reverses
and upsets of all kinds, while we have kept our head
cool and feet warm through it all. .
Major Watterson's hysterical howl ii the worst case
of the tail wagging the dog that has been proposed.
If there is no better reason for the policy of lying and
stealing in the case of Cuba it would be better to give
none ai all. \* .â¢.â¢Â¦'â¢' 'â¢â¢ "',* .-'.:Â¦
In truth it makes but little â¢ difference to us who
governs Cuba, or how. . W.e, are far more interested
in a decline of the census of murder in Kentucky, for
that is an 'American Srate, though it has Corsican
manners. When it is safe for men to go out after
dark in Kentucky Vithout wearing
clothes it will be. time to fret about the disorders and
the destiny of islands where the water, .land and air
are poison, and the fleas' and . mosquitoes spread
cholera and yellow fever. . . . ;

The simultaneous decline of vagrancy in Great
Britain at a time of something like industrial depres
sion, with a notable increase in New England during
a period of general prosperity, affords a very inter
esting problem for sociologists to study out: Possibly
the explanation is to be found in some method of
treating tramps in British workhouses that/ inclines
them to keep away. If so it might be well for Mas

company failed after the hull had been
built at a cost of $2200. It is 300 feet long,
45 feet wide and 25 feet high. The S. H.
Harmon Lumber Company secured a lien'
on the hull, which lay partly on land
owned by the French Savings Bank and
partly on Mason street. As the â¢ bank
wanted to have free use of the land, on
which a building is- being erected. Presi
dent Edward J. Le Breton notified the
Board of Public Works that he wanted
the hull removed. .The board replied that
they had no authority to do so, but that
the Chief of Police had the power under
section 31 of ordinance 1588.
Police Captain Wlttman appeared in a
new rolo vestertlay afternoon and ac
quitted himself creditably. He was or
dered by Chief Sullivan to auction the hull
of a steamer that had been obstructing
the street on Mason street," between Jef
ferson and Beach, and he executed the
order.

First Count for Har
mony Made by Union
League Club.
Deputy Attorney General
Abbott Â¦ Seconds the
, Governor.
Peace hath rpread her wings over the
executive and law departments' of the
State of California, and there is no longer
war or rumor of wars In the two camps.
The coming ot President McKinley and
the progressive tendencies- of/the Union
League Club contribute to the establish
ment-of harmony. Governor Gaga, is on
the list of new members proposed tor ad
mission to the League, and will be unan
imously elected at the next regular meet
ing of the board of directors. . ' *;y
Politicians attach a deal of significance
to the fact that the Governor's application
for membership, indorsed by General W.
H. L. Barnes, is seconded by William M.
Abbott, deputy in the office of Attorney
General Tirey L. Ford. The opinion was
once entertained in the executive depart
ment, at Sacramento that the office of At
torney General Ford was Inhabited by
statesmen and orators who were deficient
in knowledge of the law. In the office of
the law department the impression gained
force that the denizens of the Governor's
office were illustrious Los Angeles lawyers
whoso early training in statecraft had
been deplorably neglected. â¢ v
On the outside there was all around ad
mission that the talent in the Capitol
building at" the command of California
was adequate to the requirements of two
States, but expert observers â¢ contended
that the people had misplaced itâ that the
statesmen filled the places reserved for the
lawyers, and the lawyers occupied the
premises eef apart for the statesmen.
Opinions of this kind may yet be enter
tained, but they are not expressed in offi
cial or semi-official correspondence be
tween the two departments.
When the President comes to California
he will have the pleasure of. seeing the
Governor and Attorney General under one
roof.. This will signity complete restora
tion of harmony in the Republican camp,
and incidentally add prestige to the Union
League.
The luncheon to which the President is
invited must, in the order of things, be an
exclusive function, because only members
of the club in good standing will be en
titled to participate in the feast. Any cit
izen of gentle demeanor and good char
acter may obtain admission to the grand
banquet in honor of, the President pro
vided he can produce $20 to buy a ticket,
but twenty times twenty double eagley
cannot purchase a place at the Union
League banquet in the Maple Room, un
less the applicant Â¦ is a duly registered
member of the League.
When Senator Bard came down from
Sacramento a year ago with the Senator
ial toga in hlu valise, the League gave
him a reception, but tho list of the in
vited did not embrace the names of all
the orators whose educated lungs had ex
panded for expansion's sake, and bitter
ness rankled for awhile. The hope is ex
pressed that the Presidential function will
reatore the harmony which was lost in the
Senatorial reception and that no orator
will leave the banquet board with the
feeling that his services to the country and
the Republican party have not been ap
preciated. . â¢ .

Careless With a Bottle.
While Marian Brown, 1016 Leavenworth

playing In the yard of the Denman School
at Bush and Taylor streets yesterday at
noon, an empty quart bottle, thrown from
a window in the Bella Vista Hotel, struck
the girl on the back of her head, knock
ing her down. If the bottle had not first
struck on a shed one of the children might
have been killed. Detectives Ryan and
O'Dea discovered that the bottle thrower
was J. L. Brown of Akron, O., a guest at
the hotel, who is to leave the city to-day.
He was taken before the principal of the
schcol, who declined to prosecute him as
the girl was not seriously injured.
The Government tug Elen this morning

A number of sugar vessels are about

Lieutenant Thomas M. Cobb Jr. of the

were held/on quarantine island and the
body was cremated.
The session of the first Territorial Legis
lature is now drawing to an end, and it is
admitted that tlichome rule programme is
dead. Not one of the many radical and
important measures which the majority
Intended to pass has reached the Governor
and none will so to him until after the end
of the fiftieth day of the -session, when
his power of veto Is absolute. City gov
ernment for Honolulu has been abandoned
in the House and the county government
bilj drags very slowly, with . doubtful
chances of being passed at all. Taxation
measures have been lost sight of and the
proposed new election law is buried In
committee, awaiting action.
The House has killed the bill to give
former Queen Liliuokalani $150,000, owing
to a discovery that the measure was-il
legal. Other bills for her pension are be
fore the- House, but they will not pass till
the end of the session.
The liquor dispensary law was killed in
the Senate this morning. By a vote of
eight to seven the subject was laid over
for consideration by the next Legislature,
two years from now.
The strike among employes of the Hono
lulu Iron Works still continues, and the
company is sending a lot of contracts to
San Francisco, as it is unable to fill them
now. By the Mariposa about $100,000
worth of work that was to have been done
in Honolulu is sent to the coast. Â¦
HONOLULU, April 17.â The . transport
Kilpatrick arrived here on- the 13th from
San Francisco with two cases of smallpox
on board and several cases of mumps and
measles. She Is in quarantine outside the
harbor and will not leave Honolulu until
she has been thoroughly cleaned and
fumigated. All the soldiers on board will
be transferred to another vessel while the
steamer is being cleaned. The Board
of Health has refused to allow the men to
be landed hero as proposed by the army
officers, and the latter will probably
charter the schooner Mary E. Foster as a
hospital ship to quarter the men while the
transport is being freed from danger of
further infection.

Is Prepared to Bring Desired
Fluid From Coyote

A 'delegation of Eastern capitalists,
consisting ! of Messrs. Russell, 'O'Boone
and Bullard, waited on the Board of Pub
lic Works yesterday for the purpose of
submitting a proposition to supply this
city with water from Coyote River In
Santa Clara County. The three Eastern
ers represent a wealthy syndicate which
has made it a business to supply cities
with a stated number of gallons of water
dally and they were referred to the Board
of Public Works by Mayor Phelan. to
whom they first stated the object of their
Visit. . /
There wore present at the meeting 1 Com
missioners Mendell. Manson and Magulre
and City Engineer Grunsky, who listened
to the proposition as set forth by Mr. Rus
sell, who acted as spokesman for the
party. Â¦. .â¢""Â« Â«j:
"We desire to know," said Mr. Russell,
"If the city is sincere In the matter of
acquiring Its own water works. We will
meet any proposition tha Board of Public
Works is willing to make. We propose to
bring water up to the Santa Clara Valley
and will be able to supply San Francisco
with 50,000,000 gallons dally. The water
supplied to the district contiguous to the
Santa Clara Valley will pay the Interest
on the entire cost of the plant." .
After being assured that the city was
serious in Its intention of owning Its own
water -supply," Russell stated that the
syndicate which he represented owned 418
square miles of watershed in the Coyote
Valley, near the base of Mount Hamilton.
The storage capacity of the watersheds,
be Bald, was not less than 32,000,000,000 gal
lons. Colonel Mendell, who has already
niade an exhaustive report on the source,
disagreed with Russell and claimed that
the capacity of the watersheds In that re
gion is only 30,000,000,000 gallons.
Russell further stated that his company
has already made elaborate surveys of the
drainage areas and sub-service of reser
voir sites and that It was prepared at any
time to furnish San Francisco with a big
supply of pure water at once. , Russell
declined at this time to state a price, but
at the end of the conference promised to
submit In writing' detailed figures as to
the cost of each of several, propositions
which would be submitted to the Board of
Supervisors for consideration.

NEW YORK. April 24.â Among the many
broken precedents which have been recorded
in the present great Wall street speculation '
must be included the scale and character of
the professional manipulation for purely sen
timental effect on the speculative public at
large. No euch fight against a prevailing
tendency in the market was ever before wit
nessed on the New York Stock Exchange as
that of to-day. Some of the leading operators
in the recent epeculatlon are accredited with
the assertion that there is no amount, of stock
which they will not buy in order to sustain
the market for the protection of their favorite
stocks. â¢ Such statements in Wall street are
always accepted with the allowances due to
assertions palpably made for effect. Yet to
day's market gave evidence of astonishing
boldness and aggressiveness in supporting
prices by the expedient of simply buying
everything that was offered. Prices were also
boldly bid up in spite of the increasing weight
of the selling on the advance. ' The burden of
rupport seemed to grow too heavy 'toward the
latter part of the day. although the market
had been fairly bought to a standstill after
the opening. In the latter part of the day,
however, the bull pool seemed to concentrate
attention more on the stocks which had been
Â«>lt>ctÂ«Â»tJ for the most aggressive manipulation
for sustaining effect on prices generally and to
impress the public mind. Union Pacific was
the most conspicuous of these, but the spec
ulation also was very heavy In St. Paul,
Northern Pacific and Southern Pacific, and
Burlington, though not largely dealt in, was
very jealously supported. The total dealings
fn Union Pacific reached an aggregate of 662,
800 shares. As the total Issue of the com
pany's capital amounts - to less than 960,000
pharos of common stock, it is evident that to
day's sales would have been sufficient to
transfer the control of the company had they
represented actual transfer of stock In any
larrr proportion: Add the sales of Monday
and Tuesday with those of to-day, and we
have a total of 971,000 shares, which Is much
more than the total common stock issue. â¢ Yet
no hint is heard from any source :hat Union
Pacific is changing hands. In fact, there was
no fresh news at all to account for to-day's
vioie-nt rise in the stock which reached an ex
treme $%. closing practically at the top. . This
case is typical of the intensely speculative
character of the recent enormous dealings In
the stock market, although to-day's business
was even more congested in a few stocks than
at any time hitherto. In fact the general mar
ket did not at -any time fully respond to the
manipulation of the leaders. Union Pacific
at the beginning of the last hour of the day
was left alono in its upward course, the sell
ing having embraced practically every other
Ftock in the list. When Union Pacific itself
psve way the slump of prices became general
throughout the list. In the principal active
Ftocks it amounted from 2 to 5 points and
from 1 to 2 points all through the general
lift. This decline offered attractive Â¦ profits to
the room traders and when Union Pacific mart*
|ta final spurt the covering by the bears caused
Fome feverish rallies, but the closing was er
ratic with new points cf weakness develop
ing. The action of the market Is difficult to
explain from any news of the day and seamed
to be wholly due" to technical " causes. There
are those who believe that a very 'widespread
feÂ»linp exists that the speculation and the
advance In prices have been overdone." and that
there Is danger of a tight money market
which would force liquidation on an over
strained market. The disposition to draw in
speculative lines and reduce commitment* . Is
the outcome of this feeling, but it Is evident
that it Is contested by a. very powerful com
bination of speculative interests who hope to
renew thÂ» speculative activity and advance.'
Union Pacific convertible < bonds were the
leaders of the bond market at an extreme ad
vance of 2%. The market Â¦ otherwise was fair
ly active, but '-the movement -of prices was
irrprular..* Total- sales, par value. $6,325,000.

New York Stock Market.
CHICAGO, April 24.â The concentrated con
dition of May corn in the hands of Phillips
and his following of bulls was fully apparent
in the course of the market. Bids on an as
cending scale which set a ' fresh high record
for the crop at every fractional spot brought
out only meager sales and this was in the, face
of the assertion by elevator interests that
country acceptances last night Were consid
erably larger than for some time. On the other
hand, however, was a firm foundation for bull
Eentiment. } The' day's receipts, eighty cars,
with only ten - of contract grade, were the
smallest In eighteen 'months. Crop .bulletins
reported that no corn had been planted north
of the Ohio River and/for the first time in
some days there was a cash Inquiry. - It - is
doubtful if any actual transactions took place
for shipment, however, Phillips bid 50%c
in the open market for No. 3 and got none.
May opened unchanged. to %c higher at.46&@
47c. and in a few minutes shot up to 48c. The
short interest, apparently, has been pretty
well eliminated, as the bidding â¢ was mostly
by bulls, led by Phillips. He wanted May all
the way up, but. got pnly 400,000 bushels. At
the top this support was withdrawn for a
time and the market reacted suddenly to 47c,
where it steadied on the renewed bull sup
port and ' reacted sharply to 48c, advanced
further -to 48^4c, reacted to 47%c and closed
strong, l%c higher at 48%c. The July option
was but little affected by the course of May.
Traffic in wheat futures was active. May
opened %@%c higher at 71%@71%c because
cables were stÂ»ady and in sympathy with corn.
Country belief in gorgeous crop prospects was
reflected in selling orders, and for a few min
utes-there were indications of easiness. May
hpwever, worked only to 71%@71&c. - Outside
sentiment turned bullish following this and
ruled -thus to the end. The . aggressive corn
strength and highly encouraging export - talk
were the main factors, but a heavy world's
visible decrease was also Influential. â¢ May as
cended steadily to 7254c, , but worked back to
72@72Hc on profit-taking. .The close was strong
%o higher at 72%c. ' ', . sirung.
Oats were strong In sympathy with wheat
and corn, an excellent demand for the cash
article and unfavorable weather. May closed
%c higher at 26%c. ,. 3 >Â¦-;,.
. Provisions were. dull and neglected, but were
strong in sympathy with the cereal market
July pork closed 7%c higher, lard 5c up and
ribs 2%c- better. :
- The 7 leading futures ranged as follows:

The pressure has fallen rapidly during the

Weather Report.
Mail advices from New York 6ay: "The
trade is buying in a hand-to-mouth way in
practically every line of dried fruits. Some
dealer* in currants report a very slight im
provement in consumptive demand; there is. a
ccntinuance of speculative inquiry from a cer
tain large local jobbing house and figs continue
to fell quite freely, but otherwise conditions
prevailing throughout the market are dis
couraging. Stocks of California prunes are 4n
crf-asir.g and prices are weakening, with buy
ing all for immediate wants. Supplies of Ore
eens also are becoming excessive for this sea
sen of the year, and some sales at extremely
low prices are heard of. Â«jne lot of about a
car It was Ftated yesterday, which were marked
20-SOs, but counted nearer 30-40s, were sold at
6 '4c in 25- Jp boxes. Forties to fifties can be
bought at 4%c. Trade in seeded raisins, both
en the spot and from the â¢ coast, is small.
There would be more business in goods from
the coast but for the special label which the
association has specified must be printed on
each carton. This feature is strongly objected
to by the trade without exception. Trade in
loose raisins is very light. Apples are quiet,
Â¦with few goods of etdcily prime quality to be
had." â¢

CLOSING,
NEW YORK, April 24.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London, financial ..cablegram, says:
The stock market ,here was engrossed In . the
settlement to-day, after' which the tendency
to buy for speculative ' account was generally
smajlâ except in Americans,' where it was very
large and required prolonged arrangement.
Trading in the American department ; became
heavy and everybody was inclined to sell on
the break yesterday afternoon and. the day be
fore in' New York. But early purchases of
Union Pacific hardened the list, then New
York opened strong and there was a great de
mand for Union Pacifies, which advanced 'by
leapstjand bounds. The Northern Pacific issues
and SC-Paul also wera wanted and the bidding
for these hoisted the most of the list. . Lon
don, however, . is rendered very apprehensive
by. these' sporadic movements." Money was
hard owing to the Â¦ large sums locked up
against the new issue of consols. Silver was
weak on profit-taking for speculative account.

New York Metal Market.
BOSTON, April 24.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter . to-morrow will say: Aside
from the liberal purchases of fine Australia
and Ohio Delaine at the very beginning of the
week under review, by a well-known mill,
which practically cleans up the supply of such
stock in this market, <he usual trade has ruled
very dull and has presented locally few features
of interest. . The sales referred to consisted of
something like 1500 bales of Australian; which
were taken, it is reported, at prices ' ranging
from 32c to ' 34c, equivalent to a clean cost of
65@67c. The Delaine wools amounted to about
150.C00 pounds Â¦ and the . prices paid are under
stood to have been 28@29c. The sales reflect
the tendency of the demand toward fine wools,
which are relatively much stronger than me
dium and low-grade wools,' and they indicate
the confidence of consumers in this class of
stocks for which prices are firmly held. Tak
ing, the market as a whole the purchasing has
been mostly of a piecing-out character. | There
is no disposition to anticipate future require
ments to any great extent and no speculative
tendency . Is Â¦ noticeable. While trading may be
very dull the tone of the market, as far as
prices are concerned, is very steady. The sales
for the week in .Boston- amounted- to 2,591,000
pounds Â¦ domestic Â¦ and â¢ 690.0CO pounds foreign,
making a total of 3,281,000 pounds, against a
total of 4,108,000 pounds for the previous week
and; a total, of 2,256,000 pounds for the corre
sponding week last year. The sales since Jan
uary 1 amount to 76,123,000 pounds, against
52,159,200 pounds for the corresponding time
last year. â¢â¢Â¦'.Â¦.' . :' . '. .

a Question that some resi
dents consider from a standpoint
of art and others from the
standpoint of their pocketbooks.
And while the fun is going on it Is not
pafe to ask a. Belvedere resident. "How
would you like to be the postman?"
The whole trouble centers around a mail
bnx. The Postmaster has the boxes on
s-ale and has kindly and politely Invited
the islanders to come and buy. With one
exception, however, they have said him
"Nay, nay," and have then proceeded at
once to violate the sacred laws of art, for
which aristocratic Belvedere is noted.
The trouble has been brewing for some
time. Late in March the Deputy Town
Marshal O. M. Olson sent the following
edict throughout the length and breadth
and height of the island and started the
mischief-making ball a-rolling.

The package was addressed to a United

package and he paid the duties upon it,
amounting to $8 75. A man standing by
offered to take the package and ship it to
the-a"ddress of Simon in the East, and the
soldier, thinking him to be an expressman,
gave him the package. The failure of the
goods to reach their destination was re

REDDING, April 24.â But for up-to-date
inventions of this prosaic ageâ in this case
a telephoneâ a pretty romance of Trinity
County might not have reached a success
ful termination in Redding last night.
The marriage of Jesse Costa and Mary
Delano of Weavefville was opposed by
an unyielding brother of the girl. Love
found "a way in a hurried flight to Red
ding. The brother learned of the plan
shortly after the pair had left. Quickly
jumping- into a buggy behind a fast horse,
he started in pursuit, with the avowed
intention of preventing the marriage by
fair means or foul. He even said he
would swear the girl was not of age.
The sympathy of Trinity County people
was ' with the lovers. Sheriff! Bergin of
Trinity telephoned to Marshal Fisher of
Redding to instruct the County Clerk to
issue a license despite the brother, say
ing the girl was of age. The trio landed
in town after their fifty-mile drive at
about the same time, and they all met
at the dinner table in a local hotel. The
brother realized he had been checkmated
by telephone. A reconciliation followed,
and the lovers were married to-day.

satisfied that the charges preferred
against Attorney J. N. E. "Wilson by
Frank Collins Tuesday morning were un
just, and that the attorney had used all
diligence in the premises. A bill of ex
ceptions had been prepared, but it did
not prove satisfactory to Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Greaney. An order of the
court was made last January for the
court stenographer to write up the evi
dence, but it had not been done. Greaney
is in Santa Barbara and his explanation
cannot be heard until his return.
Collins has written to the Bar Associa
tion. He tsays that he has languished in
Jail since 1S99, when he was sentenced.
At that time he had paid Wilson $200 to
carry the case to the Supreme Court, and
he had now found that no bill of excep
tions had ever been made or placed on
file and that his case stood just as it did
when he was sentenced. He said he
wanted to go to San Quentin without fur
ther delay and beg-in serving his term.
He also wanted to take steps to have Wil-
Bcn disbarred, as he believed the attorney
had trifled with him and misled him.
He had received a letter from Wilson re

compelled to be absent from the city, but

prominent Cascade County sheepman,
were burned to death last night on Six

found under the dirt roof of their cabin.
It is supposed the cabin caught fire while

The story told is borne out in some
part by the officers here, who say that a
deserter was returned to the Albatross
from San Francisco the night before she
sailed. . . !
The stranger said he had a friend who
was engaged to a young lady in San
Francisco. A short time ago the lovers
quarreled and the young man shipped
aboard the Albatross as a cook. After
ward they effected a reconciliation and
thereafter the sea had no charm for the
Albatross cook and he deserted. He 'was
captured and returned to- the vessel some
days ago. His friend to-day said that he
had vowed never to sail away from the
harbor and his sweetheart.
SAN RAFAEL, April 24.â The mystery
surrounding the drowning of a sailor who
leaped from the United States steamship
Albatross off Sausalito yesterday after
noon soon after the vessel had raised an
chor and started for Seattle remains un
solved. Along .the water front at Sausa
lito it is believed that the man was a de
serter from the Albatross, and this view
is shared by an unknown man who came
from San Francisco to-day to learn some
thing about the drowning. Hints dropped
by the stranger made it appear that there
was a romantic storv back of the drown

The ladies of Belvedere have a griev
ance all of their own in the postofflce mat

been discourteous enough on certain oc
casions to refuse to wait while the ladies
penned a reply to the letters he climbed
several hundred steps to deliver to them.
The ladies, however, have taken no ac

is the way the residents treat the post
office. They expect splendid service and
yet they do all they can to lessen the
revenue of the office, the only way thev
can make the perfect service possible.
Greatest among the grievances is this
one: The residents carry all their letters
to San Francisco and mail them there.
Whereas if they mailed them in their
own place they would not only benefit the

Declares Boxes Inartistic.
Belvedere did not take kindly to the
edict. It declared that post boxes were
inartistic and would have none of them.
"When, however, the Postmaster declared
"N'o box, no mail delivery." it put aside
all question of art, nailed cigar boxes and
soap boxes at their very gates and laugh
ed at the "box approved by the Postofflce
Department for rural delivery service" at
the rate of $3 per box.
Only one man followed the Postmaster's
office Department for rural delivery service
may be Been at the postoffice.
It 6houl4 also be borne In mind that the
postmaster requires a.n order for the delivery
of mail to the Deputy Marshal for delivery to
the addressee.
â¢ O. M. OLSOX, Deputy Marshal.
C. O. Perry has followed the advice of
the Postmaster, but he did not buy one
of his boxes. He got an old tin can and
with a few deft touches turned it into
shape so artistically that it looks like the
real thing to every one but the Postmas
ter.
Dr. Edward. "Will Pownlng and J. D.
Maxwell have agreed that a post box is
inartistic and therefore a thing to be dis
pensed with. These gentlemen have no
boxes and consequently are obliged to
send to the postoffice for the mail.

cannot understand the artistic aristo
cratic residents of beautiful Belvedere.
"It is not the matter of the post boxes
that I am complaining: of," he said. "It

a box and placed it in a prominent posi

BAKERSFIELD, April 24.â A heroic act
was performed to-day by J. A. Bennett,
a young oil man from Petrolia, when he
rescued a two-year-old child from a bug
gy to which was attached a madly run
ning horse. The flying rig- with its little
passenger was. first seen by Bennett as
it crossed Nineteenth street, going south
on Chester avenue. Bennett dashed out
from the crowd, boldly leaped into the
buggy and within 100 feet had the. fright
ened animal checked and the child safe
In his arms.
Thunderous shouts went up from the'
spectators and soon a great crowd sur
rounded .man and baby, showering con
gratulations on the hero and sympathiz

more than $100 was contributed to pur
chase a token to award Bennett, in the
name of the people of . Bakersneld.
Charles Badger, a lineman, is also to be
remembered, for he tried the same feat
Bennett accomplished and got painfully
crippled in the act. He was knocked

his interest in the welfare of the lodge,
decided to make him an honorary life

presented him with a handsome en

emphatically not a play for the young

befits the brutal subject, but in spite of
that and its numerous sins of construc

The play is well taken care of by the Al

FOR STOMACH DISORDERS,
GOUT and DYSPEPSIA,
There are other reasons why those who
eat Grape-Nuts look nourished and well
fed. The food is made of parts of the
f.eld grains which Nature makes use of 5n
rebuilding brain and nerve centers. Proof
will follow use.
Grape-Nuts food is pre-digested and
also helps in digestion of other food.
The doctor's plan might do for a variety,
hut Grape-Nuts and cream alone are
considered ideal by hundreds of thou-
sands of brainy people.
Dyspepsia and bad teeth are the results
if this practice is continued. True, one
can eat soft food witliout detriment if the
necessity of chew'ng is remembered.
Grape-Nuts food 1j so crisp and brittle
and withal so pleasant to the taste that
the user cannot fore-et to chew and thus
the teeth get the necessary use- and the
glands of the gums are made to give the
juices that Nature intends shall be mixed
with the food befort it enters the stom-
ach. A Xew York doctor says many
New Yorkers put a little sugar on oat-
meal and then cover with Grape-Nuts,
and this method compels the chewing
necessary to digest the oatmeal.
Dentists agree that teeth must be used
to properly preserve them and therefore
they urge people to chew their food
thoroughly, but tfcft nervous, hurried
manner of eating is altogether too com-
mon among people and when fed on soft
mushes they are liafclc to swallow the
food without chewing.
The finest specimens of teeth are seen
In animals and human beings who chew
the foÂ»d thoroughly.

Judg-e -Murasky. made an order yester
day denying the motion for a nonsuit in
the action instituted by Horace W. Phil
brook against Van R. Paterson. The de
fense then opened. Judge Paterson tes
tified that he had no malice against Phil
brook. He did deem him erratic, however,
having seen him act peculiarly. To show
that he bore no malice toward 'Phllbroolc,
Judge Paterson stated that he had often
permitted him to use his stationery and
transact his .business- in. the '. office of
Rodgers, Paterson & Slack. J This privil
ege was accorded Phllbrook, the witness
testified,- until he abused- the same-and
cpmplaint was made against him by thÂ©
employes of the office.
Attorney Joseph. C. Campbell testified
that he had frequently seen - Phllbroolc
acting. strangely, throwing his arms up
ward and giving : other evidences of ec
centricity. Robert Y. Hayne and ex-Judge
"Wallace testified on behalf of the defend
ant. Judge Hayne directly contradicted
Phllbrook as â¢ to advice given by Judge
Hayne to Philbrook as to the best way
to proceed-to secure a review of the dis
barment proceedings against the last
named. Judge Wallace denied Phllbrook's
charge that he tried to intimidate- Phll
brook during the trial of the Levinson,
case, and 7 gave ..other evidence favorable
to the defense.
The case will go on again this morning.

ing^ Motion for: Nonsuit and

Mrs. Eugenia A. McGowan Has Her

Gowan, on the charge of threats against

living at 800 McAllister street. She said
McGowan, who is president of the Rocke
feller Oil Company, with offices at 401 Cali
fornia street, is a drinking man, and when,
in his cups very quarrelsome. Tuesday
night he purchased a revolver and when
he came home he pulled it out oJ his
pocket and threatened to shoot her. She
and the landlady had to flee for their
lives. They .went to the Grand Hotel and
stayed there all night.
Mrs. McGowan said they intended going
back to the house yesterday morning, but
were warned not to do so by a friend,
as McGowan was still holding the fort
and declaring that he just wanted to see
his wife for three minutes. Her husband,
she said, was of a jealous disposition, and
drink made him crazy. The Judge fixed
the bonds in $3000. . .
McGowan was arrested at- the MoAl
lister-street house yesterday afternoon by
Policeman Barry and locked up in the
City Hall station, being later transferred
to the City Prison. The landlady and

A SOLEMN requiem mass was cele
brated last Monday in St. Pat
rick's Church for the reDose . of
the soul of Sister Mary Lorenzo
O'Malley. Sister O'Mallev, who
died on Low Sunday just at dawn, had
been a member of the order of Our Lady
of Mercy since 18G0. Her life was devoted
u> teaching, she being at different times
connected with St. Joseph's Convent, Sac
ramento; Our Lady of Lourdes' Academy,
East Oakland; Our Lady of Mercy's
School of San Francisco, of which she
was principal for four years, and St.
Peter's School of this city, of which she
was principal for fourteen years.
Rev. P. S. Casey was the celebrant at
the mass. Rev. James M. Donald deacon.
Rev. William Lyons sub-deacon and Rev.
Thomas Larkin master of ceremonies.
The pupils of St. Peter's School sane:
"The Miserere" before the celebration of
the holy sacrifice and after the ceremo
nies they sang "De Profundis."
Rev. P. C. Yorke preached the sermon.
He said in part:
Sisters of Mercy.
While credit must be given to the faithful
Catholic people who have made countless sac
rifices In order that their children might have
the blcFCings of a Christian education, and
while we mast not forget the priests who have
given up much to endow their parishes with
schools, and while we must bear in mind that
the brotherhoods of men have done no mean
part in this important work, we must acknowl
edge that the success of the church In the
United States to-day is the success that God
gave his people at the time the Lord chose
untrt himself niÂ»w wars and Deborah arose a
mother in Israel. If the battle for Catholic
education has been well and successfully
fought in this country the credit of the vlc-Â»
tory belongs to women.

Sister Mary Lorenzo was one who did her
daily work well, yet she could look above and
beyond it. She saw that as the church Is a
teacher it Is necessary that the church schools
should teach in the best manner possible. It
is not Bhameful to acknowledge that even in
the best systems there may be room for im
provement. There is room for improvement in
our Catholic schools. Sister Mary Lorenzo
realized this truth, and If during the past
decade since the establishment of the Catholic
Teachers' Institute, of which she was the first
president, there has been Â¦ a steady upward
movement in Catholic schools, not a little of
the credit belongs to her.
But hardly for that will you remember her
now. Will you not rather keep her in your
minds as the kind friend, the tender mother,
the confidant of your Joys and sorrows? Un
der her gentle hand many of you have grown
up. How often her words have cheered you
and strengthened you on your way. You will
net remember her as she was set to rule over
you, but rather as she lay these last few years
on her -sick bed suffering untold agony, but
prayerful and resigned to God's wilL Her days
of work were ended. The rest was . coming,
but oh! with such suffering; yet her mind was
lifted above all these crosses and her lips were
ever moving in prayer for you Â¦who as little
children were in her charge. .
Need I speak to you, dear brethren, and to
you, children, many of whom have experienced
her kindly care, of Sister Mary Lorenzo, who
for fourteen years directed the destinies of this
parish school ? Need 1 tell you 'of her bright
intellect and of her devotion to work?. In the
world, there are always prizes for intellect and
work, ' but God's arm is not shortened and he
can to-day by a word call* the most gifted to
serve him and his little ones and to give to
his church services that money cannot buy.
Services Money Cannot Buy.
fiorely reeded, it has spread through all the
world and has well earned its title by devot

speak to ycu of the work the Sisters of Mercy
have done in this town. Their praise is in
the mouths of all. Whether in the sunshine or
under the cjoud. in good or in evil report, they
have Â«rone unostentatiously about their work,"
not beeklnsr for human praise, but content to
rest on Him who Beeth in secret and in secret

CHRONOLOGICAL
ORDER DOOMED
School Board's New
Rules for Teachers'
Appointment.
Committee of Educators Not
' in Favor of Priority
System.
The Board of Education is preparing to
do away â¢with the chronological order
heretofore followed in the appointment of
school- teachers in the department.- At
yesterday's meeting the committee' of
prominent educators recently selected' to
formulate a plan for the appointment of
teachers filed its report, which recom
mends the abolition . of the priority
of service method, and. while no i ac
tion was taken thereon it is understood
that the new rules will be adopted by the
board at next Wednesday's meeting. The
committee consists of David Starr Jordan,
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, Thomas J. Kirk,
Klwood Cubberley, Frederick Burk and
Elmer E. Brown. '':.'â'â¢ Â¦ Â¦ ,-rÂ« J J>
In its report the committee refers to the
fact that it was requested to draw up .a
pian for the election of teachers on the
basis of merit. It says: >
Successful Experience Necessary. Â¦
The principles underlying the selection of
teachers demand that no one should be em
ployed as a . teacher who does not possess high
personal character, liberal education and bodily
health and vigor. Successful experience is
manifestly, the best evidence of fitness for ap
pointment. ' Professional training in the prin
ciples and practice of teaching is desirable and
Is increasingly demanded In systems of public
education.
The employment of any \ sort . of personal or
political lntluence to secure appointment to the
teaching force or the urging of any'Considera
tion other than fitness for the work of teaching
as a ground for 'such appointment is held to be
an act of unprofessional conduct.- , .
The reform which you propose ia more sorely
needed than any other in the administration of
public schools. The Inertia of established cus
tom and many private and personal interests
are opposed to the change. We believe, how
ever, that public sentiment will support you in
this movement If you will make It clear that
you are acting upon sound principles and that
you have adopted wine and practicable meas
ures for carrying those principles into effect.'
The chronological order will not be af
fected in so far as the teachers at present
employed in the department are con
cerned. The rules of procedure provide
that all new assignments to teaching po
sitions in the schools of San Francltsco
shall be from an "eligible list." This eli
gible list shall consist of U) experienced
teachers who have shown themselves un
usually efficient on the initiative of â¢' the
board; (2) unusually promising graduates
of training schools, also on the initiative
of the board; (3) other qualified teachers,
on application and competitive examina
tions. The rules as submitted by the ed
ucational committee follow:
Formation of Eligible List.
The eligible list for assignment to. positions
In primary and grammar schools shall at no
time contain more than eighty names and that
for high schools fifty names. No person shall
be considered for appointment to the eligible
list for primary or grammar schools who has
not had a good secondary education' or who
shall not have demonstrated by highly success
ful teaching that he or she has had equivalent
training, and for high schools. who has not
had a good collegiate education or ; equivalent
training. Â¦ . -'...â¢Â¦
Appointment to the eligible list shall not be
regarded as complete until the person . ap
pointed shall have obtained from a consulting
physician of the board a certificate showing
that the holder is sufficiently sound in health
and possessed of sufficient bodily vigor to do
effective teaching.
The list of substitute teachers shall.be made
up independently of the eligible list, but the
persons on the eligible list may be employed as
substitute teachers.
It shall be the duty of the Board of Educa
tion to take the initiative in acquainting them
selves with the work of teachers, within prac
ticable geographical limits, who have achieved
unusual distinction in the work of teaching.
Whenever adequate evidence of the superior
worth of any teacher shall have been obtained
the board may by unanimous vote appoint such
teacher to the eligible list. But such teacher
must furnish the board Â¦ with all information
called for In the case of regiilar candidates and
must be subject to the general rules governing
such election. The board may. also by unani
mous vote appoint the graduates of institu
tions which give thorough courses in the prac
tice and theory of education, provided that at
no time shall more than 15 per cent of the
names on the eligible list be those of persons
selected in this manner. The board shall con
duct annually a competitive examination, pro
vided that not more than 50 per cent of the
names on the eligible list be selected in this
manner. The rules for examination are prac
tically the same as those now in' force. â¢ Â»
* Miscellaneous Provisions.'
AH applicants, unless excused by unanimous
vote of the board, shall I>e' required to appear
in person for a brief oral examination. . . . :
No member of the board. shall promise or give
any sort of assurance that any given individual
shall be appointed to the eligible list or that
any given individual shall receive his vote for
such appointment.
If any applicant shall approach any member
of the board with any argument or plea foi" his
appointment to the eligible list, assignment to
a probationary teaching position or election to
a permanent teaching position other than evi
dence of professional qualification such person
shall be deemed guilty of unprofessional con
duct.-
It is the duty of any member of the board
whenever any attempt is made to employ per
sonal, political or other improper influence to
report the facts to the board, and the appli
cant concerned In such improper approach
shall not thereafter be considered for appoint
ment. â¢ f - "â¢
When any name has remained on the eligible
list for the term of four years it shall then
be stricken from that list, unless retained by
a unanimous vote of the board.
Assignment to Positions.
"When any vacancy occurs in a teaching posi
tion the names of all persons on the eligible
list, whose qualifications are of the kind and
grade called for in the vacant position, shall
be read before the Board of Education, and the
board shall then canvass, thoroughly and im
partially, the qualifications of all such persons.
Priority of appointment to the eligible list
shall not be considered in the selection of the
person to- fill any such vacancy, nor. shall any
other condition or circumstance be so consid
ered, except superior fitness for the discharge
of the duties of the position to be filled. When
the qualifications of all persons available have
been fully canvassed the board . shall proceed,
without nomination, to ballot for the selection
of a person to be assigned to the vacant posi
tion. The person receiving three votes shall
be so assigned. ."â¢-Â¦-â¢Â¦ . â¢ . â¢ â¢â¢Â¦.-
Every person assigned from the eligible list
to a teaching position shall be on probation,
before final election, for . a term of not less
than two years, if such person shall have had
successful experience In teaching â¢ for a period
of two years prior to such - assignment; and
every person so assigned shall be on probation,
before final election, for a term of. not less
than three years, if such person shall not. have
had successful experience in teaching for a
period of two years prior to such assignment.
. Denman "Wants Charter Obeyed. .
Dennian made a futile' effort to induce
the board to co'mnly. with * the charter in
the repairing of. schools. He was opposed
to giving' the work out by the day or per
mitting â¢ the Board Â¦ of Public "Works to
have its own men perform the work. He
said that there should be competitive
bidding, so that the work could be done at
the minimum of cost. A resolution was
then adopted requesting the Board of
Works to prepare plans and specifications
and estimates of cost for adding another
story to the Buena Vista schoolhouse.
Denman's resolution that the Board of
"Works be requested to let all contracts
for repairs'on school buildings which shall
exceed $250 to the' lowest bidder was lost.
Leaves of absence were gTanted to Miss

If any tell-tale lines on her mobile coun
tenance. Her eyes are brilliant, her hair
a bright golden shade, and her â¢ figure
slight, yet shapely,, like a 'girl Mn the
sprlnsr time of youth.
"I have come' back- to .California," said
the charming little woman, "solely In the
hope that. the climate may prove of bene
fit to my mother. She is 81 years old and
her health Is very poor. ' â¢
"I have left the stage for good and all,"
she declared, after enthusing about Cali
fornia scenery and climate. "I have made
a farewell tour, but, nevertheless, I made
my farewell tour eight years ago. I have
had numberless offers' to return to the
Â¦stage, but have never considered any. I
have never felt any desire to return to
the theater, and I cannot say that I have
ever missed the glare and glitter of the
professional life or the i applause of the
admiring public. It takes all my time to
look after my business interests."
Lotta declares that the development of
business cuallflcations with her has been
a matter of slow movement.
"I just had to take hold," she explained,
"or else some one else would, and perhaps
so completely that there would have been
nothing left for me. I have considerable
property." in s New York City - and Boston,
and some little real estate in San Fran
cisco, and the proper management of. it
all requires my entire time and atten
tion." , - >. â¢ -Â¦
Â¦ Lotta's stay in California is at present
a matter altogether, and delightfully in
definite. ! Â¦ .:Â¦:
"It all depends on mother." she says. .
