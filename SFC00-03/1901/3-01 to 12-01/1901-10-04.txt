Much valuable time was taken up by the
discussion as to whether the body should
not secure another building for its meet
ings, . and much confusion was caused in
the morning by the inability of deputies
in the rear of the church to hear the
speakers on the platform. In some
instances deputies voted for certain reso
lutions when they were of opinion that
the motions were entirely different. The ,
local committee received instructions to
have certain alterations made- in the
interior of the church, and it is hoped that
the erection of screens will remedy the
defects that caused so much trouble yes
terday.
The most important work done by th/
House of Deputies yesterday was the aff
ceptance of certain amendments to thÂ£
constitution, as reported by the special
committee appointed in 189S. The amend
ments as accepted appear in the annexed
report of the proceedings of the House of
Deputies. â¢ - -

The resolution was placed on the cal

TO CHANGE NAME OF
COMMON PRAYER BOOK
Rev. Dr. Taylor of Los Angeles then
presented a resolution, looking to the
change of name of the book of common
prayer. The resolution was as follows:
Resolved. ' the House of Bishops concurring.
That the title page of the Book of Common
Prayer be as follows: "The Book of Common
Prayer and administration of the sacrament
and other rites and ceremonies of the Holy
Catholic church according to the use of the
Protestant Episcopal church In the United
States of America, together with the psalter
of the P6almb of David."
"At some proper time," said Dr. Tay
lor, "I hope to have something to' say. It
is not a proposed change of name at all,
but it is a proposed description of what
the Protestant Episcopal church is, and I
ask that it be referred to the committee
on the prayer book."
Deputy Baker of New Jersey moved
that a committee be appointed to arrange
for the formation of a special fund to
assist clergymen whose salaries are In
sufficient for their work. The resolution
was referred to a committee.
Deputy Lewis of .Pennsylvania precipi
tated a debate by introducing a resolution

Rev. Dr. Greer of New York then pre

with the- resolution received from the
upper house. The committee appointed by
the chairman consisted of Rev. Dr. Greer
of New York, Rev. Dr. Lynes of Florida
and Rev. Dr. Lewis of Pennsylvania.
Deputy Morehouse of Milwaukee pre
sented a resolution that the name of the

sionary Bishop of South Dakota, spoke on

Rev. Dr. Egar explained that no change
could be made in the proposed amend
ment and that it must be accepted or re
jected in its entirety. The only plan to
get rid of the third section, referring to
the presiding Bishop of the church, was
to pass the entire article and then move
to amend by changing the objectionable
section 3.
Some of the deputies objected to delay
ing the matter for three years, and while
the discussion on the article was in prog

WHEN the House of Deputies met
in the afternoon Mr. Morehouse
of Milwaukee was recognized.
He took the platform and asked
the delegates whether it would
not be better to refer the first article of
the constitution back to the committee
for amendment before it was passed on
by the House of Deputies. He argued
that this would be the wiser course. He
therefore offered as an amendment to the
resolution that action on the article under
discussion be postponed until 12 o'clock
Monday. .
A motion was made to lay Mr. More
house's resolution on the table and It pre
vailed.
DR. ROGERS OBJECTS
TO THE AMENDMENT
Rev Dr. White of Maryland and Rev.
Dr Rogers of Fond du Lac also advanced
objections to the passage of amendment
3 of article 1, which provided for the suc
cession by priority Of consecration of pre
siding bishop. Dr. Rogers proved an able
orator. His voice was strong and could
be heard in every part of the church.
His argument had a telling effect on
his hearers. He said it was a constitu
tional question- and a very important one.
.Continuing he said: Â¦. .
This is a question that is going to radlcally
change the organization of the American
church, as Bishop Ferry very well points out
in his VHistory of ' the Constitution of the
American, Church." When those first dioceses
came together they did it upon the basis ot
absolute equality, and. as he says,' they have
here asserted, directly and indirectly, diocesan
independence in all matters not bpeclrlcally
surrendered, since all dloceae3 are authorized
to demand a vote by -orders. We are going, in
other words, on an entirely different line when
we elect a presiding Bishop of this . church,
and the most feeble and infirm ot all, and put
him In- charge during the vacancies in general
conventions- during recesses, in charge of mis
sionary Jurisdictions, in charge of many other
duties that are given to him by the House of
Bishopsâ I say we are going to radically change
the system of organization by the influences,
the position arid the titles which we are now
giving to. an officer of the church. ;
Though having voted to postpone action
until next Monday Dr. Rogers moved for
a - reconsideration. Dr. Egar rose to a
point of order. He claimed this matter
was. passed on by members of the last
general convention who knew, what they
were about. Any motion, he said., to post
pone is irrelevant and the only thing for

Dr. Huntington recurred to the question
which Dr. Egax's motion had temporar
ily sidetracked and brought on a renewal
of the discussion and entanglement by
raising the point of order that a grave
doubt existed as to whether the result of

order, improper and inexpedient to pro

plain that the declaration of the result

actual flsrures of the vote.
Dr. Egar then submitted article 2 of
amendments to the constitution and tho
assistant secretary read it aloud while tha
delegates followed the reading from pam
phlets in their possession.
The delegates were In great doubt ax
to whether the first article- had passed

DELEGATES VOTE IN
F0VOR OF NEW LAW
The chairman ruled against Dr. Rogers
and he therefore moved to take the reso
lution of postponement from the table.
Dr. Huntirigton rose to a point of order
that blocked this move, and the conven
tion voted on the subject. The following
amendment to the constitution was
adopted by a vote of 64 to 39; divided, 9:
article I.
Section L There shall be a general conven
tion of this church, consisting of the Hou3e of

Rev. Dr. Huntlngton of New York City
then moved that his motion, of the pre
vious day that the first amendment to
the constitution proposed by the last gen
eral convention for adoption by this con
vention be made the order of the day at
the noon hour be taken up.
Rev. Dr. Fulton of - Pennsylvania
thought that the house should- not take
such a step until an order of business was
established by the two houses, as the
joint committee would undoubtedly make
an early report.
Rev. Dr. Greer of New York moved to
amend Huntington's resolution by adding
the words "until or unless a different or
der of business be reported by the joint
committee of the two houses on order of
business."
Huntington accepted . the amendment,
which was put to a vote and carried.
The house then proceeded to take action
on the amendments to the constitution as
reported by the committee appointed" in
1898.
Rev. Dr. Egar of Central New York
Â¦was elected to "lead" the debate and he
took a seat on the platform. Printed cop
ies of the amendments were distributed
to the deputies by the pages.
Dr. Esar moved- that the first amend
ment be adopted, â¢ which was done by
unanimous vote.' A discussion followed as
to the matter of reconsidering the vote,
many of the deputies stating that they
had not heard the reading of the resolu
tion, while some of the, speakers. objected
to' the omission of the words, "the House
of Bishops concurring,"; in the preamble
to the amendment. Considerable opposi
tion was expressed to section 3 of. the

ferred to the committee on unfinished

Rev. Dr. Easton of Tennessee moved
that a committee be appointed to draft
resolutions on the death of President Mc-
Kinley. The resolution was adopted and
the chair announced that he would ap
point the committee later.
The chair appointed the following- com
mittee on the question of a sustenance
fund for clergymen with small salaries:
Rev. D. N. A. Baker of New Jersey, Dr. J.

Rev. Dr. Davenport of Tennessee, a
member of the committee on canons, pre
sented a resolution recommending that

frage Bishops be discharged from fur
ther duty. It was so ordered.

THE temporary home of Bishop

of Clay and Laguna streets was
the scene of a brilliant reception
to the visiting Bishops last night.
Those who attended pronounced it one of
the most pleasant features -of the gath
ering.
The handsome parlors were prettily dec
orated for the occasion, their appearance
adding greatly to the warmth of the wel
come extended by the California Bishop
and his charming wife to the visitors and
their wives and daughters.
The reception was an Informal affair
but an imposing one, and afforded those
present an opportunity to judge of the
wealth of hospitality which Californians
are prone to lavish upon visitors to their
State.
Following is a list of the Bishops, many
of whom were accompanied by their
wives and daughters, who attended the
reception:
Rt. Rev. Dr. Tuttle, Rt. Rev. Dr. Morris,

residing therein and settled and qualified -as
above provided.
Article six was introduced by Dr.* Egar.
He saJd it was new and was a needed
amendment. It was read, and the Rev.
Dr. Mallory of Milwaukee found some
objection to it on the ground that It was
ambiguous. Dr. Egar removed the doubt
that existed in ' the clerical delegate's
mind, and he called upon Judge Fair
banks of Florida, who was the father of
the amendment. His explanation was
satisfactory and it . was passed unani
mously. It is as follows:
Section i: The House of Bishops may es
tablish missionary districts in States and Ter
ritories or parts thereof not organized Into
dioceses. It Â¦ may also from time to time
change, Increase or diminish the territory in
cluded in such missionary districts In such
manner as may be prescribed by canon.
Sec. 2. The general convention may accept
a cession of the territorial Jurisdiction of a
part of a, diocese when such cession shall
have been proposed by the Bishop and the
convention of such diocese, and consent there
to shall have been given by three-fourths of
the parishes in the ceded territory, and also
by the same ratio of the parishes within tho
remaining territory^
Any territorial Jurisdiction or any part of
the same, which may have been accepted from
a diocese by tho General Convention under the
foregoing provision may be retroceded to the
eaid diocese by such Joint action : of all the
several parties hs Is herein required for Its
cession; provided, that such action of the
General Convention, whether of cession or re
trocession, shall be by a vote of two-thirds
of all the Bishops present and voting and by
a vote of two- thirds of the House of Deputies
voting by orders.
Sec. 3. Missionary districts shall be organ
ized as may be prescribed by canon of the
General Convention..
After the reading of the following
amendment it was adopted:
Dioceses and missionary districts may be
united into provinces in such manner, under
such conditions and with such powers, as
shall bo provided by canon of the General Con
vention; provided, however, that no diocese
ehall be -Included In a province without Its
cwn consent.
The Rev. Samuel Hart, secretary of the
House of Bishops, brought the following
message from that body and it was re
ferred to the committee on the Book of
Common Prayer:

DR. COWDEiN" IS REFUSEÂ©
â¢ A WRIT OF MANDATE
Judge Hunt Decides That State Board
of Examiners Has Power to
Â¦Withhold Certificate.
The application of J*- J. Cowden, a grad
uate of the Pacific Coast Regular College
of Medicine, for a peremptory writ of
mandate to compel the State Board of
Medical Examiners to Issue to him a cer
tificate authorizing him to practice' medi
cine, was denied by Judge Hunt yester
day. \
Cowden was refused a certificate by the
Board of Examiners on the ground that
the Institution was not a college in good
standing. He appealed to the courts and
the Board of Examiners was ordered to
give him a further hearing. The result of
the hearing was a second refusal to issue
a certificate.
Cowden then applied for the writ of
mandate, which was refused by Judge
Hunt yesterday. His Honor held that to
Issue the writ would be an interference
with the duties of the board, which was
empowered to grant or deny a certificate
to practice- i

BRITISH- AMEBICAOJ- TTNTON
EXPRESSES ITS SORROW
Passes Resolutions Deploring the
Assassination of the Chief Ex
ecutive of the Nation.
Dr. Robert Mackenzie delivered a lec
ture Wednesday night before the British-
American union on the life and death of
our late lamented President, William Mc-
Kinley. Mrs. Stadtfeld and Mrs. J. J.
Newbegin rendered several solos.
The following 1 resolutions were adopted:
Whereas, William McKinley, the honored
chief magistrate of this nation, has been
stricken clown by the hand of a foul assassin;
now therefore be it
Resolved. That in the death .of this Christian
gentleman the nation lias lost a wise ruler,
the heart-broken wife a devoted husband, ! and
the world a brave apostle of civil and religious
liberty; and
Resolved, That we, members of the British-
American Union, regard the dead Presi
dent as a martyr to principle; and that we
hereby emphasize our detestation of the crime,
and our abhorrence of tha man or men *ho
could sanction or encourage ao base a' deed;
and - . ... . .
Resolved, That the well-being of society de
mands that strenuous laws should be speedily
passed to crush out anarchy; and that if
necessary the nation by concerted action
should take vigorous measures to thwart thia
vile conspiracy against God. and mankind; and
Resolved, That we extend to the dear woman
who mourns In thÂ» desolate home our heart
felt sympathy and assure her that If the tert
der solicitude of ths good in all lands can
afford her consolation it Is hers.
The following officers and directors were
elected for 1901-02: ' .

president, Dr. F, W. d' Evelyn; -second vice
president, J. J. Newbegin; third vice president,
of union teamsters could be made.
The smaller draying firms had little
trouble in securing their old teamsters.
Notwithstanding this, however, very few
men returned to their trucks. Manager
Renner of the . association estimated last
night that 'the number of teamsters who
returned during the day will not exceed
fifty. His firm, the Stetson-Renner Dray
ing Company, had succeeded in securing
only two. J. S. Jacobs Company ten, C.
B. Rode & Co. four, Englander Bros,
seven, and G. W. Emmons four. A few of
the smaller draymen who employ from
one to six teamsters secured their old
hands, but the number is not large.
Messrs. McNab & Smith retained the
services of their special policemen at their
own expense yesterday. This firm has kept
about a hundred' non-union teamsters con
stantly employed, during the strike. Many
of these men proved themselves to be
faithful and competent, and when the de
mand -was made that they be discharged
In favor of a union crew, the demand was
refused. The firm announced that it
would take back twenty-five of its old em
ployes, and when this was made known at
headquarters it was decided that no
union teamsters would be allowed to re
turn to this firm until a more satisfac
tory arrangement as to- tho employment

J~y UT a few hundred of the thousands of strikers ivcrc able to return to work yesterday. A scries
Â£~j of misunderstandings prevented the teamsters from taking the trucks out, and along the
" zuater front not many strikers found work waiting for them. Much dissatisfaction with the
terms of settlement developed, but the Brotherhood of Teamsters determined last night that its mem
bers should apply to their former employers for ivork this morning. No action adverse to the settle
merit has been taken by any of the water front unions, and rumors that the strike is on again are un
founded.
Father Yorke addressed the meetings of the Brotherhood of Teamsters and the " Sailors'
Union at night. He advised the teamsters to go back to work and renew the sinews of zvar, and said
that they could "attend to the 'scabs' later."
unions are upholding the peace agreement
Brotherhood of Teamsters Approve the Settlement and Members Will Apply This Morning to Former Employers
for Positions, Consenting for the Present to Work With Non-Union Men Who Have Proved Efficient*
pÂ»rj=^HE members of the Brotherhood
I of Teamsters gathered in force .at
1 Turk-street Temple last night and
11 after a heated debate, to which
was added the fiery eloquence of
Rev. Peter C. Yorke, formally ratified the
terms of settlement of the strike and
agreed to apply this morning to their for
mer employers for work.
That there was a wide divergence in
sentiment . concerning the terms upon
which the strike was adjusted was evi
dent during the progress of the meeting.
That element which was unalterably op
posed to the idea of fraternizing. with non
union drivers was with difficulty recon
ciled to the thought of working by the
side of men with whom they had been at
open war for so many weeks. In order
that their scruples miÂ»ht be overcome it
was decided to send for Father Torke, and
when that prelate took the platform the
hall was crowded almost to suffocation. â¢
Father Yorke recounted the facts In con
nection with the settlement of the strike
and explained the terms the substance of
which was published by The Call yester
day. He assured them that they had en
joyed a signal victory and that their tri
umph, although not now recognized,
would ultimately be acknowledged.
"How about working along with the
'scabs'?" shouted a man in the rear of the
hall.
"You can attend to them later," was the
reply, as repeated afterward to the re
porters outside by an officer of the union.
Michael Casey also made remarks. He
told of the meeting of the Governor and
representatives of the Draymen's Associa
tion and said the terms were satisfactory.
There had been some misunderstanding
among the men, but when the terms were
explained all dissatisfaction, was- dissi
pated. â¢" *'. ' V- â¢Â¦
A motion was subsequently made ratify
ing the terms of agreement and it was de
cided that all union men should return to
work ..as soon as possible, fulfilling the
contract by applying at once for their for
mer jobs.
LEADERS ADDRESS SAILORS.
"The Governor will give out whatever
is intended for publication. We have
promised to say nothing." This is all
the strike leaders had to say. â¢ .
Prior to his visit to the Sailors' Union
Father Yorke addressed the Longshore
Lumbermen's Protective Association. He
exhorted them to be loyal to their agree
ment, saying that it had been made after
careful consideration and with a single
eye to the best interests of the city, and
that the people of San Francisco looked
to all parties to observe not only its let
ter but its spirit.
Both the longshoremen and the sailors
passed resolutions indorsing the peace
agreement.
At a special meeting of the Sailors'
Union last evening Andrew Furuseth,
Michael Casey and the Rev. Peter C.
Yorke In addresses to the sailors re
viewed the situaticn and tried to impress
rpor. the men the necessity tor their ac
ceptance of the terms of settlement as
made by those to whom that task had
been delegated. The meeting was largely
attended and the trio of orators left the
Fathering apparently well satisfied with
then efforts.
Neither Casey nor Furuseth would dis
cuss the situation.
Almost all the members of the Sand
Teamsters' Union, which went on strike
in sympathy with the Brotherhood of
Teamsters, returned to work yesterday
morning. None of the sand teamsters
knew what the terms of settlement were
and Business Agent Harper In an inter
view stated that he had not yet been
informed of the nature of the agreement.
In very few instances had the places of
the sand teamsters been filled by non
union men and in consequence the con
tractors were ready to take back their
former employes.
Gray Bros., who have the contract for
sweeping and sprinkling the streets, re
ported that many of their old teamsters
were taken back yesterday and that
more would be re-employed to-day.

A rather pathetic Incident of the recent
ctrike developed yesterday at the City
Prison when Charles Lynch, aged 12, and
tv.-o companions, James Bryant and Al
bert Edberg. aged 12 and 13. respectively,
were arrested on a charge of having
etolen a few handfuls of iron nuts from
the Southern Pacific Company. Bail was
fixed at $2000 in each case Shortly after
the three youngsters arrived at the prison
it was learned that the Lynch boy's
father. Peter, who was shot at the cor
ner of Eleventh and Harrison streets on
July 31, during one of the labor scrim
mages, was dying. Attorney Martin
Qulnlln took pity on the youths and,
after explaining the predicament of the
Lynch boy to Judge Fritz, succeeded in
having' the ball reduced to $50 In each
rase, which he immediately furnished out

Hurries Away to Dying Father.
George Hart, manager of Farnsworth &
Ruggles. reported at the office of the
Draymen's Association that his men were
intimidated- by the union strikers. As a
result of these threats, few of his teams
were out. Mr. Hart thought the outlook
for an amicable settlement of the trouble
Drivers Fear Violence.
At the stables of the Western Transfer
Company, on Harrison street, near
Fourth, there were threats openly made
against non-union drivers, the result be
ing that twelve of the drivers resigned in
order to avoid trouble. The company con
sulted with a committee of the strikers
and offered to take back half of its old
employes. The teamsters refused to con
sider the proposition, "but referred the
company to the union officials. It was .de
cided under tha circumstances to discon
tinue the trucks .until some arrangement
could be made with Michael Casey. Mean
while the non-union teamsters declined
to risk themselves on their trucks with
out police guard, and a few police were
sent for and employed.
The teamsters did not carry out Mr.
Renncr's idea. The old-time pickets went
on duty, and when a teamster showed up
at any of the stables south of Market
Â¦street he was instructed to go to head
quarters before entering upon his em
ployment. At the Overland stables, on
Bryant, between Fourth and Fifth streets,
a large crowd fathered, and when the
non-union teamsters appeared on their
trucks they were greeted with derisive
laughter and cat-calls. Several hoodlums
threw rocks, and in therabsence of police
escort the teamsters decided that it would
be unwise to go out. The -company tele
phoned for specials, who arrived within a
short time. The crowd then dispersed
and the trucks went out. as before, under
guard.
An immense gathering of teamsters at
their headquarters on Fourth street was
noticeable at 6 o'clock yesterday morning.
Fully 1000 men were congregated at that
point in anticipation of the arrival of the
draymen, who, it was understood by
them; were to come to headquarters for
the purpose of re-engaging their old
teamsters. The only drayman to appear
was C. B. Rode, who had discharged his
non-union men and was desirous of tak
ing back his old teamsters. He succeed
ed in finding his men and they accompa
nied him to the stable. The failure of the
other draymen to appear on the scene
caused some dissatisfaction among those
who did not understand .the situation, and
some bitter language was Indulged in.
About 7:30 o'clock Manager George Ren
ner of the Draymen's Association, who
had been notified that a misunderstand
ing prevailed, went to the teamsters'
headquarters and formally notified the
leaders that the men must apply to their
employers if they desired to drive trucks.
He further advised that those belonging
to the larger draying firms send a small
delegation to the firms with a complete
list of the men who desired reinstatement
and then await developments.

DID NOT CHANGE CKEWS.
With the circumstantial detail with
which only a Hearst publication dares to
garnish a deliberate falsehood the* Ex
aminer yesterday morning announced
that the steamships Sierra and Walla
Walla would sail with union crews and
that the men engaged under strike con
ditions had been discharged simultan
eously with the announcement of the set
tlement of the strike and their places
given to members of the union.
The crews for both these vessels were
chipped in the regular course. The crews
of both vessels were non-union and not
only did each vessel sail with the com
plement originally shipped but the mat
ter of making any change was never con
sidered either by Captain Wallace of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company or Cap
tain Howard of the Oceanic Steamship
Company, as the men had been engaged
before the strike was declared off.
So circumstantial was the Examiner's
fabrication of the changing of crews that
a number of the firemen on the Walla
WaJla were all prepared to go ashore
when Captain Wallace "arrived on the
dock. He promptly disabused their minds
cf the idea and furthermore assured
them and everybody else on board that
he was perfectly well satisfied with them
rnd as long as they did the work they
could remain in the employ of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company.
Neither on the Sierra nor on any of
.the Spreckels tugs did the settlement of
the strike cause any changes. Both tugs
and steamship are equipped with com
petent crews.
THE promise of a speedy return to
normal industrial conditions was
not fulfilled yesterday. Of the
thousands of men out on strike
but a tew hundred returned to
â¢work, and the undercurrent of discontent
seemed to grow even more portentous.
However, the peace agreement still holds,
and union men are instructed to uphold
it by applying this morning to their
former employers for work.
The teamsters, acting under instruc
tions, gathered early in the morning at
their headquarters to wait for the dray
men to appear and reinstate as many as
needed. The draymen understood that
the -teamsters were to apply at the stables
for their former jobs, and the misunder
standing delayed the hoped lor readjust
ment. During the day a number of dray
men were informed that the non-union
men must be discharged, and for a time
a repudiation of the settlement by the
teamsters seemed imminent. Dissatisfac
tion was also rife on the water front,
where the strikers found little work for
them to do at once, and rumors became
current that both the teamsters and' the
longshoremen would refuse to return to
work unless all non-union men were dis
charged. Many employers felt that the
situation had become more strained than
before. Manager George Benner of the
Draymen's Association voiced the gen
eral query when he said, "The strike lead
ers have agreed to termsâ can they deliver
the goods?"
The strike leaders were busy at the
evening meetings of the unions "with plans
"to deliver the goods," and though the
report had become general that the strike
was on again they succeeded in keeping
the men in line. Andrew Furuseth, Father
Yorke, Michael Casey and Walter MacAr
thur adflressed the teamsters and the
Bailors and impressed upon them the
necessity and the wisdom of accepting
terms to which their leaders had pledged
them.
The Brotherhood of Teamsters formally
ratified the terms which were published
in yesterday's Call. By this act they
agree to apply for their former jobs under
a year's guarantee that the old schedule
of v.-ag-es, hours and overtime shaJl not be
disturbed. They lose the "barn steward."
they consent not to molest non-union men
employed with them and they agree to
obey orders. The employers agree to give
as many of them work as there are places
for and not to discriminate against union
men.
As a result of a threatening attitude of
the union men toward non-union drivers
yesterday the police has again been or
dered to report for duty at the stables,
with trucks and in the "danger district."
ICon-unlon teamsters will be protected as
before the strike was declared off. Cap
tain Wittman said last night:
There will be no further . violence If I can
help It. As a precautionary measure I have
ordered all the policemen, including the spe
cials, to report for duty at 6:30 o'clock in the
morning. They will take their old places on
the teams and In the stables. Just as though
the strike was still unsettled. The non-union
men must be protected and I prooose to use
every precaution to prevent attacks "being made
en them. Until peace has been completely re
stored the police will continue guarding non
union men and their teams.
COMPARATIVELY few union m*n
went to work yesterday along the
water front. In spite of the fact
that the strike is declared off. the
members of the City Front Fed
eration were not, on the first day of tha
peace, in urgent demand. More will go
to work to-day and as the days pass
many will secure their old or new posi
tions, but they have all learned that it U
much easier to go out on strike than to
get back on a payroll.
In the course of a few weeks the Pa
cific Mail Company will probably be in a
position to offer work to a number o>
longshoremen. At present the number of
men on the dock Is greatly in excess of
the requirements. The City of Sydney
and the Peru are the only vessels in port,
at present. They are receiving freight,
but this work gives employment to but a
small number of the men regularly estab
lished on the dock. A crowd of union men
assembled at the dock gates yesterday
morning and announced their willingness
to go to work. None were called on, how
ever, and little encouragement was of
fered for the immediate future.
The Pacific Mall Company has never
recognized any union either on Its ships
or on the dock. They will not discrimi
nate, however, against union men and
when the necessity warrants it many of
the old hands will get a share of th*
work.
A number of union longshoremen apÂ«
plied for work at the army transport
dock. They were told that instead of
looking for men the army authorities
were discharging laborers. Seven were
paid off yesterday and more will follow
to-day.
Steuart-street dock, devoted to the busi
ness of Williams-, Dimond & Co., was an
other unfruitful field for the searcher for
work. The non-union men engaged dur
ing the strike have proved to be an ex
ceptionally able lot. Most of them will bo
retained as long as they wish to stay.
Negroes to Be Discharged.
At Howard-street wharf No. 3. where
the Panama Railroad Steamship line' 3
Enterprise is discharging, no union men
were engaged yesterday, but it is expect
ed that about forty will be put to work to
day. On this dock the work is not regu
lar, and those in charge of the loading
and discharging 1 have not been able to or
ganize their non-union laborers as has
been done on the inck>sed docks of other
regular lines. For the past few days over
a hundred easy going "darkies" have been
toying with the freight brought by the
Enterprise. These longshoremen will be
paid off and their places taken by the
men that have been out on strike.
On the Oceanic dock there was no de
mand for labor, Captain Howard having
organized the men secured during the
strike Into as able aa aggregation of
freight rustlers as ever worked along the
water front. These men will also be ra
tained as long as they wish to stay.
A similar condition of affairs exists on
the docks controlled by the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company. Captain Wallace
has more than enough men for- the re
quirements of the company's business and
will decline to discharge any of those able
and willing to do the work. This applies
to the company's steamers as well. Tha
violation of the contracts made with the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company has
cost the sailors and firemen of this port
one of their very best friends. Andrew
Furuseth visited the company's offices
yesterday for the purpose of finding out
something of the prospects of work fcr
those who had been out on strike. He
was told that for the present there were
no vacancies and that the company would
make none, but that in the event of va
cancies occurring they would be filled
from the ranks of applicants without re
gard to their relations with any labor or
ganization. Captain Wallace has told the
men at present employed on the docks
and steamers of the company that their
positions will not be in any way affected
by the settlement of the strike.
Union Men on Lumber Schooners.
The steamship Columbia, which has
been carrying an enlarged crew during
the strike for the purpose of working
cargo independently of conditions ashore,
is loading with her own men. These ex
tra men will probably be paid off at the
end of the present trip and the work of
loading and discharging will be performed
by regular longshoremen labor.
The schooner Lizzie Prien yesterday
commenced discharging her lumber with
union men. The schooner Jennie Thelin
went to sea with a union crew, but the
workÂ«of discharging the Alaska Packers-
Association vessels continues with labor
engaged during the strike.
At Main street a few union men were
engaged and they worked In harmony
with a number of the men taken on dur
ing the strike. The HelenÂ© and Irmgard
yesterday shipped union crews and the
ship Emily has half union and half, non
union men.
The British ships Clan Mackenzie. Aus
tralia and British General will all com
mence discharging to-day with union
h Â£ lp - * The Haddon Hall, almost dis
charged, will finish discharging wlth.her
own crew.
Many of the coal teamsters engaged
during the strike will be retained ferni
anently. W. G. Stafford has taken back
all his old employes with the exception
of his foreman and three yard hands
Dunsmulr's and Rosenf eld's made no
changes yesterday in their teamsters and
will make none. . yTfc
About fifty sailors were shipped daring
the day and more will be ensued as t hi
tied-up vessels get ready for sea. Thl
sailors crowded the office of the Shfn
ow ne , Â£ s ' Assocjatton all morning, but it
will be some little time before many of
the participants in the strike find them
selves afloat again. The work of the
shipping master is for the present a dead
letter. The sailors are attending to this
business for themselves and for once
blood money does not enter into tha
bargain.
A Matter of Time.

returned _ to work but it will take time
before the shipjoiners. bridge builders

find occupation for their trades. With
the ship s cooks and stewards it will also
be a matter of time.
The union marine firemen were In evi
dence yesterday at the . dock offices of
the various steamship lines, but for the
present but few of them were shipped
and that only on the smaller boats. As
the big liners of the Pacific Mail Com
pany and the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany come to port a number of them will
find employment, but it will be several
weeks before anything like ante-strike
conditions will be resumed.

and through his testimony Taylor was
convicted. While awaiting sentence Tay

remote section of Pecos County. Taylor
was shortly afterward recaptured, but he
again escaped from Jail a few weeks ag-o.
At the time of his last escape he said he
had a few old scores to settle with those
who had turneJ against him. He added
that when he had done with them he

Captain Lemly began his cross-examination
by asking the witness whether he was as sure
of the position and actions of the Brooklyn as
he had been of the way the Brooklyn had been
turned on the day of the Santiago battle.
The witness replied that he wan more certain.
He repeated his statement made yesterday that
he had made the entry in the log that the vessel
had turned with a starboard helm, when in fact
it had turned with a port helm. He said he
had not consulted with any one except Com
mander Sharp before he changed the entry.
The questions were then asked by Hanna, who
traversed the same ground gone over by Cap
tain Lemly In the examination in chief.
Hanna cross-examined the witness regarding
his testimony bearing upon the battle off San
tiago, asking him first as to the direction in
which the Spanish ships were headed as they
came out of the mouth of the harbor.
Witness Cross-Examined.
Admiral Benhamâ Did you read the signal?
"I did not, but I understood what it was, and
If I am not mistaken it was McCuuley, an en
sign we had on' board, who made the signal
himself. Shortly after this the forward turret
and starboard turret of the Brooklyn' were di
rected to load the guns with armor-piercing
shells. The forward turret was directed to fire
first two shots, which it did. The shots fell
short. Then I was directed to fire and I fired
at a range as I now recall of 6500 yards. We
tried both guns at that range. Those shots fell
short. We loaded again in the starboard turret
and I increased the range to 6700 yards and fired
the right gun. It went a little to the right of
the Colon, as near as I could judge, but the
range was very good. The Colon very shortly
after that went ashore. We steamed up to her
and proceeded to get out a cutter for Captain
Cook to go over and receive her surrender."
order was to man the starboard battery. 1 got
out of the turret through the roof, that being
the most convenient way of getting out, and
crossed over to the starboard turret. . As I was
going into the starboard turret I had an oppor
tunity to see the Spanish ships. They were
then a little on our starboard helm. As soon
as I had charge of the controller which, up to
this time had been in charge of 'Wood-ward, I
swung the turret around on to. the starboard
bow. In the meantime some of our forward
guns had fired. The volume of smoke was so
great that It must have come from one of the
eight-inch guns of the forward turret, so I was
entirely shut out from seeing the enemy. While
the guns were in this position Mason, our exec
utive officer, passed down the starboard gang
way, calling 'Sharp on. the starboard quarter.'
The interval of time from the time the guns
were on the starboard bow- or starboard quar
ter. I. think must have /been two minutes. I
swung the guns around to the starboard quar
ter and then we picked up the enemy. The
range at which I fired, to the best of my mem
ory, was about 1400 yards and from then on it
was a constant fire, training the guns until we
finally got them on the starboard beam. The
range increased up to 20C0 yards and during
the run after being parallel with the SpanlBh
ships the range varied from about 2300 to 1S0Q
yards. I think when the Viscaya went inshore
the ranee was then about 1800 yards. Imme
diately before she turned in she made a sheer
with her starboard helm, apparently coming to
ward us and then immediately put her helm
around the other way and went inshore. From
then on it was a chase after the Colon. At the
time the Viscaya went ashore, the Colon, by
working up inside of the other Spanish ships,
had secured a very long lead. I should
say she was at least five or six miles, perhaps
more, on our starboard bow, well in shore. The
order was given to cease firing and to come out
of the turrets and take a 'spell' during the
chase of the Colon. The Oregon, during the
chase and while we were on the top of the
turret, was directed to try her 13-Inch guns in
the chase, which she did. and the shots fell
short. In a little while they were tried again
and came a little closer."
Admiral Deweyâ Directed by whom? .
"By Commodore Schley. sir, by wig- wag sig
nal, as I remember It."
Admiral Dewey â You saw the signal?
"Yes. sir, I saw the signal being made."-
The witness was then, requested to give a
brief account of the part taken by the Brook
lyn In the battle of July 3, which he did,
repeating what he had said yesterdaj-.
After stating the preliminaries Lieutenant
Doyle related his observations of the battle
in the following language:
"I fired Â¦ the left gun first and . Halligan
shortly afterward fired the right one. Then we
began to load the guns again. It was neces
sary then after loading the guns a second time
to turn the turret directly ahead, as our ship
was apparently shutting the enemy out by
turning with a starboard helm. Immediately
after firing that left gun the second time the
Brooklyn's Part in the Battle.
The reply was: "Smoke w.is observed rising
in the harbor on July 2 and my impression
now is and -always has-been since that night
that that information- was conveyed to the
commander in chief."
Captain Parker announced his willingness to
"open the door wide." He wanted the entire
matter Investigated and would have the
eearchlijrht turned upon every individual, from
the commander . in chief to the lowest officer
t'.nder him.
Raynor was then permitted to ask his ques
tion, which he did in the following words:
"Was the smoke observed on July 2 by Com
modore Schley communicated to the squad
ron?"
Captain Lemly objected and Raynor said
that his purpose was to prove that it was
believed at that time that the Spaniards were
preparing to withdraw from the harbor and
that Commodore Schley had communicated the
facts to the squadron. It was competent, he
baid, to prove the conduct of the commodore
under the department's precept. . . . .
Captain Lemly and Hanna contended that
the certain effect of these questions would be
to open the gates for an interminable in-
Quiry and if one side should enter on such
questions the other must also be allowed to
<!o so. They did not object, except for the
reason of time involved.
Raynor then asked the witness whether on
July 2, 1898. he had observed smoke coming
from Santiago harbor over Zocopa Hill.
"I did not have an opportunity, as the com
modore -was near or at the conning tower, to
observe his conduct during the battle, but Im
mediately previous and after I did have an
opportunity to ; do so. Ke always struck me
as being just about as well possessed as it
was possible for anybody to be under ihose
circumstances."
""What was his conduct? I refer you to the
first specification of the precept: 'His conduct
through the Santiago campaign and his con
duct at any time during either the bombard
ment or the battle of July 3, when his ship
was under fire.' "
"Bvery time we were under fire." he re
plied, "during those bombardments and in
the battle of July 3." . Â¦
Schley's Conduct in Action.
Replying, Lieutenant Doyle said that at the
bombardment which had taken place June 6
the Zocopa battery had replied at first very
spiritedly, but that it soon "went out of
business."
After the ships withdrew the enemy had
again manned their runa_Â«nd then shot at
the ships. On the occasion of the second
bombardment they did not remain so long.
"They always took a snapshot at ua as we
left." he said.
Raynor then asked Lieutenant Doyle how
often he' had Been Commodore Schley under
fire during the Santiago campaign.
"What do yÂ»u know from your own ob
servance in reference to the strength of the
shore batteries and guns? I want the result
of your observation at Santiago acquired by
you at any time without going .nto any gen
eral or specific details as to the bombard
ments."
Before a reply could be given the court
retired for consultation. At the conclusion of
the conference Raynor changed his question
so as to read as follows:
tho shore batteries as a result of any bom
bardments in which eha had participated in
June.

But while all agree that it would be desirable
to have the case terminated at an early day,
they also agree that there is little prospect in
that direction. Judge Advocate Lemly probably

J-ut Raynor has almost forty numbers on his
ligt. He says, however, that he does not ex
p<?ct to examine mere than half of this num
ber. Still, he will not undertake to name a
day for the close of the trial -within a month
from this time. He does not expect to call
Admiral Schley to the witness Etand.for some
time ypt. Raynor expects his client to make
a complete review of the case and it le proba
!i> that the admiral will be on the stand longer

Both the court and counsel are beginning to
Fhow the effects of the arduous duties Imposed
by the trial. Especially heavy is it upon the
attorney*, both foT Admiral Schley and for the
Navy Department. Their duties do not cease
when the court adjourns In the afternoon, but
they extend far into the night, and often they
are found at their labors before the breakfast

WASHINGTON-. Oct. 3.â After
Lieutenant Doyle, formerly
of Commodore Schley's flag
ship, the Brooklyn, had com-
Captain W. A. Dawson of the United States
. Marine Corps was then called as the next wit
ness. He was the signal officer, on board the
battleship Indiana during the battle off San
tiago and said that during the battle he had
occupied a place on the .bridge beside Captain
Taylor and had been able to see well. He said:
"I had a clear view of all the vessels up to
the time the Indiana was directed to return
during the chase of the Colon." '
In reply to a question from Captain' Lemly â¢
the witness said at this point he had seen no
signals from the Brooklyn directing. the move
ments of the fleet during the battle. He then
told of the action of the Brooklyn in running
eouth shortly after the battle began, saying he
thought that the vessel was disabled and was
retiring from action. Later he said the Brook
lyn steered a course parallel, but a mile or a;
mile and a half to the southward, skirting
along the column formed by the fleet. By that
time the chase was well under way and the
relative positions of the vessels were not
chansed.
Keynor's cross-examination of Captain Daw
son was directed toward showing that his testi
mony was based upon recollection and that
I consequently he was liable to be inaccurate.

"The first one must have been southwest.
They steamed right toward us, that is, when
I first saw them they were on our starboard

After Lieutenant Doyle was excused Lieu
tenant Commander Clifford J. Boush. who had
made for the court the large chart of the
positions of the vessels of the American squad

those charts and to state the date upon which
they were prepared. Â¦ â¢ â¢ ' â¢
By the courtâ What direction did the Span
ish ships take immediately after clearing the
entrance to the harbor?
"At the time I referred to the Spanish ships
were in column, standing right toward us and
about a point on our starboard bow."
"You have stated that while you were on
top Â¦ of the starboard turret ! it ' looked very
much as though there was going- to be a gen
eral melee' or mix-up with the Spanish ships.
I want you to give as nearly as possible the
relative positions of the vessels, Spanish and
American, to the Brooklyn at the time you
refer to."
"What orders were elven by signal from the
Brooklyn to the fleet during the action of
July 3?" ... . . ; Â¦â¢
"I do not know : except what I have already
testified to about the wig-wag." -
The witness replied that: there had been no
effort except in making inquiries of the cap
tain of the British vessel Adula.
Captain ' Lemly then asked a number of
questions. The first of these called for an ex
planation of what tha witness meant yester
day when he said h9 thought that Just after
the beginning of the battle of July 8 there was
a prospect' of a. melee. ;
"I thouKht," responded the witness, "that
the ships were coming- right toward us. I
thought they would get into us, and I thought
we would have a mix-up, as they were about
1400 yards distant."
Judge Advocate 1 â Do' you mean 'that "the
course of the Brooklyn took her acrosa the
Spanish line and that she necessarily ma
neuvered so as to make a turn to avoid that?
"That is what I mean."

TlÂ« afternoon session began "with Inquiries
concerning the wig-wag signal to the Oregon
from the Brooklyn to fire her 13-inch grun. The
witness said that he was sure he had seen
the signal made, but that he was unable to
find an entry of the signal in the ship's log.
"How sure," asked Hanna, "da you feel of
your recollection as to the way they were
headed at that time?"
"That is one of the things that most firmly
impressed itself on my mind."
Lieutenant Doyle said he had made his ob
servations of the battle through the peep-hole
from the sliding head and again related how
the enemy had been cut off from his vision
by the smoke of one of the Brooklyn's big
Ifuns. The cross-examination upon these In
cidents was in progress when the court took
its mid-day recess for luncheon.
; "They were. certainly firing- in our direction,"
was flie response. The witness said that after
that the firing was from both sides of the bows
of the enemy's vessels.'

THE GREAT,
IN NEW AND MYSTIFTINO ILLUSIONS.
:. â¢â¢ ::.-- SEATS NOW . READY.-...,... ... _ ,
William C. Whitney has retired from the English
turf. This is generally accepted as an indication that
the English turf is not what it is represented to be.
Almost without exception the press of England is
expressing the hope that the. administration of Presi
dent Roosevelt will be an absolute success. This is
one"of the English hopes entertained in reference to
American affairs which without. question will be abso-
It is becoming more arid more evident that the
advocates qf the reciprocity .treaties! are going to
make a vigorous fight for their adoption" this winter,
and unless California interests are carefully guarded
by her Senators, they ; will be. sacrificed for the sake
of promoting Eastern, trade. . . ,
'There are already: signs that President Roosevelt
will have enough hardjWork in the White House to
satisfy even his delight in the strenuous life. â¢ It is
said he will be expected to straighten out the Re
publican party in the South and Republican faction
fights in New York in addition to administering the
affairs of the nation.
FROM time to time there have come discour
aging reports concerning the prospects of the
. approaching Pan-American Congress which is
to assemble during the present month in the Gity of
Mexico. First, the antagonism of Chile to certain
proposals for submitting boundary disputes to ab
bitration was declared to be an insuperable ob
stacle to success, and when that was overcome a new
set of obstacles was found in the disturbances in the
isthmus and the threatened outbreak of war between
Colombia and Venezuela. â¢
It now seems that diplomacy, backed by resolution
on the part of our Government and working with
patience and with tact, has at last made the way clear
for the accomplishment by the congress of a consid
erable part at least of the good work that is expected
of it. Many of the diplomatic representatives at
Washington of the Central' and South American
States have been appointed by their Governments to
represent them at the congress, and that in itself is
promising of good. Those delegates will not meet
as strangers. They will carry from Washington to
Mexico a good understanding of. one another and a
friendliness born of long social and diplomatic rela
tions that will be helpful to the congress in many
ways. It is to be noted, moreover, that many of the
other delegates to the congress have visited Wash
ington for the purpose of having -conferences with
Secretary Hay as a preliminary to proceeding to
'Mexico. Some of these are to stay over at the cap
ital until the time comes to start for the congress, '
and then they will make the. trip together in a special
train.
Out of all the preliminary canvassing of: the ques
tions that are to come before the congress it is reas
onable to expect that a basis of agreement on many.
THE PAN AMERICAN CONGRESS.
Washington City has long desired the Government
to construct a monumental bridge . across the Poto
mac as a memorial of the reunited Union, and as Mc-
Kinley was strongly in favor of the enterprise it has
now been suggested that it might also be made to
serve as something of. a monument to him, since he
not only fought for the Union but during his Presi
dency did so much to put an end to sectional feeling
arid establish a genuine harmony between the people
of the two sections.
Under any circumstances the sound statesmanship
and common sense that are expressed in those words
would have won for them the approval of thinking
men, but they have now an added significance since
they come to us as something like the last political
will and testament of the great man to whom Ameri
can industry arid the American people owe so much.
It was not a new subject to him. In his last mes
sage to Congress he said: "American vessels during
the past three years have carried. about 9 per cent of
our exports and imports. Foreign ships should carry
the least, not the greatest, part of American trade.
The remarkable growth of our steel industries, the
progress of ship-building for the domestic trade and
our steadily maintained expenditures for the navy
have created an opportunity to place the United
States in the first rank of commercial maritime pow^
ers. Besides .realizing a .proper national aspiration
this will mean the establishment and healthy growth
along our coasts of a distinctive national industry,
expanding the field for the profitable employment of
labor and capital." ' .^ . . . ; 'â¢â¢"'
President Roosevelt's declaration of an intention
to carry out McKinley's policy in its entirety cart
leave no doubt of his willingness to approve any
well considered measure designed to bring about in
our merchant marine the improvement which his
great predecessor, so much desired. It would seem,
therefore, that at last -the Republican' party is about
to fulfill its'pledges to the people on this subject, and
that American commerce will not much longer have
to seek transportation in foreign ships.'. ' >
own. The consequence has been that remarkable
development of German industry and trade which is
one of the salient features of the history of the last
twenty-five years.
In his speech made at Buffalo just before his as
sassination President McKinley said: "Next in ad
vantage to having the thing to sell is to have the
convenience to carry it to the buyer. We must en
courage our merchant marine. We must have more
ships. They must be under the American flag,
built and manned and owned by Americans. These
will not only be profitable in a commercial sense;
they will be messengers of peace and unity wherever
they go."
DISPATCHES from Washington announce
that Senator Frye has been in conference
with leading Senators and business men for
the purpose of framing a merchant marine bill which
will be adequate to the needs of the country and at
the same time satisfactory to those Republican Sen
ators whose objections prevented the passage, of the
shipping bill at the last session. The report says the
changes to be made from the former bill are not ex
pected to be important; "they will hot touch the
principle involved, but will merely alter some minor
details upon which the opponents of the measure
have heretofore hung their objections."
â. It is gratifying to learn that the conferences have
been such as to, justify Senator Frye to expect the
passage of a merchant marine bill at the coming ses
sion. He will have his new measure ready for pre
sentation about as soon as Congress meets, so that
it can be promptly taken up and acted upon. Sev
eral of the former opponents of the -measure are an
nounced to have already declared a willingness to
support the modified bill, so that the outlook for ob
taining the legislation needed to develop our ship
ping upon the high seas is much brighter than ever
before. -; '
It is certainly high time something should be done.
We are now producing in many lines of manufacture
much more than our own people can consume, and
accordingly we have to find markets for such goods
in addition to the agricultural products we have so
long been exporting. The new expansion of our
trade brings us into direct competition with the great
manufacturing countries of the world, and we must
meet that competition or suffer. The Germans long
since perceived the advantage Great- Britain was
drawing from .her hold upon ocean commerce, and
they set about building a merchant marine of their
OUR . . MERCHANT MARINE.
It is stated that among the papers of President Mc-
Kinley there were found upward of 5000 letters re
questing his autograph. ' It was the .custom of the
President to write autographs for applicants when
ever he had leisure, and the applications found among
his papers were those that had come in during the
vacation. It appears from this that the army of
autograph seekers is even larger than was supposed
and if the gang were to organize they might elecf a
President of their own. :
When his own partisans tell Mr. Bryan directly
that he is excusing anarchy by an untruthful* state 1
ment, in impeachment of his own country, it would
seem to be time for him to recall his raw fancies and
grill them awhile over the fires of common sense.
Again, a murder-inciting phrase is used, with no
specifications. Where in all the world are human
rights as well protected, as much respected and as
secure as here? Where, indeed, is money as much
subordinated and property as much subjected to the
absolute control of the whole people as here? Noth
ing can be held as property, as wealth, except by the
consent and creation of society. Here the voice of
society is uttered with power by the majority, which
rules. The safety of property in the United States
lies in the fact that here more men own property than
elsewhere in the world.
Mr. Bryan's third argument for anarchy, "the fat
tening of the few at the expense of the many," is an
untruthful statement. The enterprise of the people,
wrought upon the richest natural resources in the
world, has made the few rich and the many prosper
ous, and this nothing can prevent except repeal of
all laws creating and protecting property. In the
direction of such repeal Mr. Bryan has appealed to
the people for eight years unsuccessfully. He has
failed, not because too few have property, but too
many, for his purpose. If the conditions he pictures
existed anywhere except in his inflamed and vagrant
fancy, his impassioned appeals would have produced
results, not in murder, but in a political revolution.
As they did not exist, his appeals have touched only
the idle, thriftless and criminal minority, who would
not be industrious, thrifty and law-abiding under any
conditions nor under any form of government.
We do not charge that Mr. Bryan has intended it
to be so. Shallow and ignorant as he is, he may be
able to cognize as facts the creations of his fancy.
His intentions may have been good, but all that does
not change the fact that he has defamed his own
country by misrepresenting conditions which he as
cribes to the administrations of its government.
We have no partisan motive in saying these things.
Indeed, the New York World, lately a bitter partisan
of Mr. Bryan, rebukes him with great energy, and
says: "It is by fostering such ideas that shallow
speakers and reckless newspapers do infinite harm.
This is the best country in the world for working
men, as the constantly inflowing tide of immigration
proves. Instead of teaching that 'we should avoid
those things that breed anarchy,' all public speakers
and teachers ought to proclaim the truth that there
is never any excuse for anarchy, nor is anarchy a
remedy for any evil or wrong that exists anywhere in
the world." ' '
Mr. Bryan's statement of.it means that his school
of politicians intend to persist in the propagation of
anarchy by persistent misstatement of conditions and
of the responsibility of government therefor. He de
clares the conditions which: he describes to exist in
this country, and ascribes their existence to the favor
of the government â that is to say, to the administra
tion of which the murdered President was lately the
head. His expression is in generalities. "Partiality
of government"â what i3 it? In what special act or
acts of the government is it manifested? Who are
its beneficiaries and on whom does it place burdens
that justify murder? Mr. Bryan gives no bill of par
ticulars. He makes a statement, sinister and mis
leading, against his own country, and every man who
for any reason, usually because of his own incapacity,
is not successful as he wishes, immediately shifts
the blame from himself to the Government and be
comes a potential anarchist. Then Mr. Bryan con
tinues to rub the blister he has raised by proclaiming
that the Government has compelled "the exaltation of
money above human rights.". . *
"creed of; anarchy. and its. reason for. being..' Gori and
Bakounin in collaboration could'inot have more^x*
actly stated the reason for the anarchist organization
of "the propaganda of the deed."
Mr. Bryan, discussing such laws, says: ; "While we
are legislating to prevent^any manifestation of the
anarchistic spirit on American soil, we should avoid
those things which breed anarchy. Partiality in gov
ernment kindles discontent â the exaltation of money
above human rights, the fattening of a few at the ex
pense of. the many ? the making of artificial distinc
tions between citizens and the lessening' of the
sacredness of human life- 1 â all these in their full de
velopment breed anarchy."
That is an exact and condensed statement of; the
OUR prediction was a safe one to make that
the discussion of laws suppressive of anarchy
would occasion a revival of demagogy.
BRYAN STILL AT IT.
points will have been reached before the congress
meets. Consequently we may have important re-,
suits, notwithstanding the gloomy situation. _at .., .the
isthmus. In fact.'o farirpm the strife in that quar
ter resulting in a failure of the it is quite
possible the congress .may result iuiipujtting an end
to the strife.
The issue is one of importance to us as well as to
the countries south of us. In a recent article in the
London Saturday Review it is estimated that the
European capital invested in Central and South
American countries aggregates the vast sum of
$2,500,000,000. Most of the invested capital is Brit
ish, but the Germans,, are pushing their commerce
with all the countries south of us, and- their- monetary
interests there are very large. We. cannot afford to
sit idle and permit the trade of these Amerioan states
tobe^taken away from us. Ifis therefore to- our in
terest to do all we can to" bring the" Pan-American*
Congress to a happy conclusion, and- in 'particular to
strive' to so direct its proceedings that the actions
of the congress with, respect to international com
merce will Â¦ be' mutually beneficial to all American
countries.

AiNSWERS TO QUERIES.
Mr. Flint is a resident of the Thirty-ninth
District. This district is' not represented among
the Republican nominees for Supervisor, while
the Fortieth has three representatives. The
suggestion Is made that W. H. Cobb would
willingly retire, but I understand that he is a
good lawyer and a very capable man and I am
Looking Toward the Fortieth.
Mr. Wells replied: "I did so signify."
Concerning W. F. Herrin's connection
with the incident the nominee for Mayor,
responding to questions, said:
I did not go with Mr. Goldberg in a carriage
to see Mr. Herrln, but it was reported to me
that Mr. Herrin said my wishes in this regard
should have been respected. He. holds with me
that Mr. Flint should go on the ticket. It is a
question now of taking some one on* the. ticket.
The interviewer asked: "Did you signify
that you would retire from the contest
if Mr. Flint was not put on the ticket for
Supervisor?"
Mr. Flint is also a man of fine business.at
tainments. I have known him for many years
In the commandery.' We have served together
on important occasions. I urged him to allow
his name to go before the convention as a
candidate and he reluctantlyâ very reluctantly
acceded to my wish. I was surprised and some
what indignant when I learned that he was
not placed on the ticket, as this was the only
request that I made in regard to the Board of
Supervisors. Perhaps in my warmth I ex
pressed my mind too freely to Mr. Goldberg
and Mr: Riordan. ' â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦ - Â¦
I did send In a request that B. P. Flint should
be placed on the ticket for Supervisor and was
greatly disappointed when I found that he was
not nominated. I was particularly anxious for
his nomination. I know him -well and appreci
ate the strong points of his character and know
that he possesses superior ability as a presid
ing officer.
Mr. "Wells Quite Surprised.
At the Pleasanton Hotel last evening
Mr. Wells accorded an interview to The
Call. Tbe chief topic embraced in the in
terview was Mr. Wells' expressed desire
for the nomination of Mr. Flint. On this
point the nominee for Mayor said:
ranks of the party to which
Mr. Wells belongs. Every possible effort
was made last night by the managers of
the late Republican convention to iron
out the wrinkles in the programme, and
several of the leaders went so far in ef
fort to produce smoothness and harmony
as to challenge the accuracy of a state
ment published in an afternoon paper
that , Mr. Wells threatened to withdraw
from the race if B. P. Flint were not
placed on the ticket for Supervisor.
ASA-R. WELLS, -Republican noml
' nee for Mayor, exploded a shell in
the political camp yesterday. The
explosion created alarm in the
Thomas D. Riordan, chairman of the
Republican Convention, made several
statements yesterday as to his conver
sation with Mr. Wells. In an interview
a representative of this paper had with
him # on Montgomery street he denied
Chairman Biordan Speaks.
At this hour my decision- to retire from the
ticket if- Mr. Flint is not put on for Supervisor
is unchanged.
Brilsford P. Flint, the particular friend
of Mr. "Wells, ran for Mayor twenty-four
years ago and was defeatedby I. S. Kal
loch. Max Goidberg, who goes on the
campaign committee, is an alert shaver of
demands on tho city treasury. He ran for
delegate to the Republican local conven
tion, but was turned down by the people
of his district. "Whenever delegates to a
convention. State or district, are appoint
ed Max Goldberg gets in. When the vot
ers are consulted he is generally kept out.
Asa R. Wells' predicament in the mat
ter of B. P. Flint's aspiration for ser
vice on the Board of Supervisors is the
result of neglected opportunity. Mr. Her
rin being engaged in other duties cort
nected with the railroad delegated to Jere
Burke the task of selecting for the Re
publican convention a list of eighteen can
didates for the Board of Supervisors. Mr.
Wells should have made his wishes known
to Mr. Burke before the slate was closed.
This after growl places the railroad com
pany in. a very embarrassing: position
and causes the push to swear that the
nominee for Mayor is a political lobster
of the seventeenth degree.
As. late as 11 o'clock last night Mr.
Wells said:
Should Have Seen Jerry Burke.
I am .familiar with the custom, as I have
served on two campaign committees. It was
a surprise to me when I heard that Max Gold
berg was not placed on the campaign com
mittee, but this can be rectified by the en
largement of the committee. Chairman Rior
dan can add Mr. Goldberg to it. Mr. Goldberg
is an able and useful man. He is familiar with
the duties pertaining to the management of the
campaign.
not willing that he shall -be displaced. The
committee can adjust this in some way.
I am familiar with the duties and responsi
bilities of the work at the City Hall and know
how important it is that the Mayor should be
strongly supported by the Board of Supervis
ors. Yes, I understand. that Mayor Phelan was
consulted in all the Democratic nominations for
the board, yet I only made one suggestion re
garding Supervisors and that was Ignored.
Speaking of the campaign committee,
the nominee for Mayor remarked that it
was customary for the head of the ticket
to name or be consulted in naming such
committee. Mr. Wells said:
Mr. Riordan also stated that in tha
conversation about Flint not being a can-*
didate for Supervisor. Mr. "Wells asked;
"Did you ever know a case where that
Mayor had not something; to do with thei
naming of. Supervisors?"
Mr. Riordan replied: "I know of but:
one case â¢ where ho didâ that of Mayotf
Phelanâ and the board he named was the,
worst the c'ty ever had." Continuing
Riordan said: "There are eighteen As
sembly Districts In this city, and don'C
you suppose that the representatives oÂ£
those districts know better who they*,
want for Supervisors than you do 2'*
PERSONAL MENTION.
Mr. Wells most either be daffy or erazy, and?
I would be willing to give 5300 personally If
he would withdraw from the ticket.
I have no doubt Mr. Flint would have been
nominated for Supervisor had Mr. Wells* re
quest been made a little earlier. However. I
never knew that Mr. Wells desired any man to
be nominated until I talked with him this
morning. One fact I will emphasize again, and
that is that Mr. Wells, did not threaten -to
withdraw from the ticket during the conver
sation I had with him this morning.
A few hours later Mr. Riordan was in-Â»
tervfewed again on Market street.
He was asked flatly it it was not at
fact that llr. "Wells had stated that heÂ»
would withdraw from the ticket if B. P,
1-IInt was not nominated for Supervisor.
Mr. Riordan said then:
Says "Wells Must Be Crazy.
Mr. Wells certainly felt hurt that Mr. Flint
â¢was not nominated, but he certainly said noth
ing to me about withdrawing from the ticket
if Mr. Flint was not given a place.
Max Goldberg, nor any other man, was pres
ent at our interview. In reference to Max
Goldberg all that Mr. Wells said was that ha
would like to have him placed on the campaign
committee. In the afternoon I acceded tq his
request by appointing Goldberg to the com
mittee and having his certificate filed wlUx the
Registrar.
emphatiennjr that Mr. "Wells had In
formed him that he would withdraw from
the ticket unless B. P. Flint was placed
upon the ticket as one of the Super
visorial nominees. Mr. Riordan said:
I called upon Mr. Wells In hla office in ths
City Hall yesterday morning and after greet
ing him as Mr. Mayor, discussed the political
situation in general.
Mr.- Wells expressed his displeasure that Â»
certain gentleman was not placed upon the
ticket as a nominee for Supervisor. He did
not mention the gentleman's name, simply say
ins he -was an excellent parliamentarian and
that ho 'knew he would not only make an ex
cellent Supervisor, but would be able to serve
as president pro tern, of the board In his (Mr.
Wells) absence. I did not learn that Mr.
Flint was the gentleman Mr. Wells referred
to until afternoon.
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR MAYOR
THREATENS TO ABANDON THE RACE
WHILE the Protestant Episcopal church in
this country has a less number of communi
cants than several others, it ranks among
the foremost in wealth, in the prominence of its mem
bership and the eminence of its clergy. It conse
quently exerts an influence upon public and private
life second to that of no other denomination. Its
power happens to be greatest in the richest and most
populous States in the Union, and that fact adds to
its prestige throughout the country.
Since the foundation of the republic the growth of
the church in numbers and in wealth has been extra
ordinary. Statistics show that while in 1800 there
was but one Episcopalian to every 584 inhabitants in
the Union, there is new one to every 106. Thus
Episcopacy has increased even more rapidly than the
increase of population. The growth, moreover, has
been much more rapid of late than in the earlier
years of our history. In 1873 there were 235,100
communicants; in 1901, 719.540. In 1873 the con
tributions were $6,187,000; in 1891, $16,069,000.
There are thirty-nine parishes having incomes in 1900
that are each larger than the incomes of all parishes
in America in 1800, and there are fourteen dioceses
having in 1900 more communicant members than
there were members in the whole American Episco
pal church in 1800. Connecticut, Long Island, Mas
sachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania have each
more communicants to-day than there were in the
whole country as late as 1832.
Under any circumstances the assembling of a con
vention of such an organization would be a matter of
interest and importance, but there is a special inter
est in this convention, inasmuch as .it is the claim that
the convention is more thoroughly representative of
every State, county and city in the Union than is the
general convention of any other religious body.
Moreover, it is to deal with several problems in
which nearly all the people of the country are inter
ested, regardless 'of their church affiliations, and
whatever action the convention may take upon them
will unquestionably exert an influence far wider than
even the widespread membership of the church itself.
Another salient feature of the gathering is the ex
traordinarily large proportion of eminent men among
its members. Whether attention be directed to the
House of Bishops or to the House of Deputies,
there will be noted in the list of members name after
name of men whose repute is as wide as the nation,
and some, indeed, who have a world-wide renown.
If such men came to us in even an unofficial capacity,
they would command honor by their personal dignity
and merit, and would receive it from all who - are
capable of appreciating the worth of high character
and the usefulness of noble service rendered in the
name of religion.
It is "gratifying to San Francisco to have this
notable convention, and the influence it will exert
upon the community cannot fail to be helpful in many
ways. It not only affords us another opportunity to
display the proverbial hospitality of San Francisco
and ,pf California, but furnishes an added proof that
the city is no longer regarded in the East as a place
remote from the life of the; nation, too far from the
center for general gatherings of conferences and con
ventions. . We have, therefore, a double reason to be
pleased at the presence of so eminent a body of men,
and the pleasure has been abundantly manifest in the
cordiality of our welcome.

PHOENIX. Ariz., Oct. 3.-The El Paso,
Phoenix and California Railway Com
pany, whose articles of incorporation
were filed yesterday with the Territorial
Secretary, is said by its promoters to be
a bona fide railroad building enterprise,
backed by New York capitalists. The
tacit admissions of some of the incor
porators warrant the assertion that it is
a proposed connecting link between the
eastern terminus of the San Diego and
Yuma Railroad, now building, and the
Phelps, Dodge and Palmer Railroad, now
building from El Paso to Benson, Ariz.
The latter road is admittedly working in
harmony with the Rock Island route, now
in El Paso, so that with the completion
of the other roads named the Rock Island
will eventually have a Pacific Coast ter
minal in San Diego.
These facts are not publicly announced,
but the inference Is ciear. The life of the
Arizona legislative act exempting rail
roads from taxation for twenty years ex
pired last August. Previous to that date
notice of intention to build was filed with
the Territorial Secretary by several com
panies, among them the El Paso, Phoenix
and California, the legal requirement be
ing that construction work shall begin
within six months. By the 31st of August
the articles of incorporation were pre
pared, with the following named incor
porators: Ex-Governor M. H. McCord, J.
A. Kurtz and J. L. B. Alexander of Phoe
nix, and J. J. Hodnett and M. E. Curry
of Tempe. The capital stock was $10,000,
000.
Capitalists' Names Withheld.
Hodnett went to New York, where he
secured favorable consideration, and re
turning filed the article^. When seen to
day by a Call correspondent Kurtz said
he was not at liberty to give the names
of the New York capitalists, but that the
road was an entirely independent organi
zation, however harmoniously it might
work with connecting lines. The men be
hind it are amply able to carry out the
work, and he has every confidence that
they will do so. Some preliminary sur
veying has been done and the route has
been carefully gone over.
The line will run from Benson down the
San Pedro Valley to the Gila River, then
down the Gila to Florence and across the
rich mesa land from there to Phoenix,
thence west to the Colorado River. It will
run through rich mining or agricultural
country practically all the way. F. M.
Murphy, president of the Santa Fe, Pres
cott and Phoenix Railroad, and associates
have organized a company for the con
struction of a line between Phoenix arid
Benson over practically the same terri
tory, except west from here to the Colo
rado River, and their engineers are now
in the field. Whether they contemplate
extension to California or not, or simply
to connect with the Santa Fe, Prescott
and Phoenix at Phoenix is not known.
When the matter of parallel lines from
here to Benson was suggested to Kurtz
he said:
"Mr. Murphy's operations were Inaugu
rated after our notice of intention was
made public. I -lon't know what his plans
are, but we are organized for business."
J. L. B. Alexander, a stockholder in and
attorney for the company, said in answer
to a request for information:
"I can't tell you anything now. The
first thing is to arrange matters with the
capitalists who have agreed to take out
bonds, the trustees. New York bankers,
etc. I can simply say that the New York
parties have approved otir articles and
returned them with instructions to pro
ceed, which we are doing."
Terminal Still a Secret.
He was asked about the Â¦western ter
minal or connecting line. He replied that
the articles read: "On the Colorado River
at or near Yuraa. Our organization and
exemption is confined to Arizona. Beyond
that I have nothing to say." * ;
Asked if the line would not amount to
an extension of the San Diego and Yuma
road he said, "There you are," in a voice
that indicated that that conclusion Is
Â¦well founded. Still he insisted that no
plans were made further than the Colo
rado River, and that the road might con
nect therewith any road it chooses, now
operating or to be hereafter built. Hod
nett's remark3 Indicate that the road Is
more likely to connect with some line now
in existence, or to be built, having a ter
minal In Los Angeles. He said that if the
Nicaragua canal is built In the near fu
ture, or steps taken for its construction,
San Diego Â¦would be a preferable outlet,
otherwise Los Angeles would be the'ob
jective point.
The company will hold a meeting In a
few days for the election of officers. The
incorporators are all representative Ari
zona citizens, though not wealthy men,
and all announce that the capital for the
enterprise will come from New York.

CASHIER DISCOVERS .
"GOLD BRICK" IN TIME
GRASS VALLEY, Oct. 3.â A Chinese
yesterday appeared at the Bank of Ne
vada County here, offering gold for sale.
Cashier Root found the yellow metal good
and made a purchase. He told the Chi
nese he would like to buy any more which
that individual or his friends might have
for saie at any time, whereupon the Chi
nese drew a gold bar from his blouse and
offered It for sale. It fell short in weight,
and the assayer of the bank was called In
to apply a test. The assay disclosed the
fact that although the "gold brick"
weighed fifteen ounces, it contained just
28 cents worth of gold. The rest was
copper or brass composition.
The Chinese, on being questioned, said
he bought the brick long ago from a white,
man, paying $43 for it. However, he did
not seem surprised at the result of the
assay and refused to talk further. He has
not been seen since.

TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 3.â Executive
Commissioner Johnson of the Washington
Pan-American Exposition Commission
has received a letter from Archie B. Mc-
Ardle, telling how Washington's big tree
stump, sent to Buffalo to demonstrate the
size of Puget Sound fir timber, has been
the means of reuniting two lovers who
were parted years ago by a petty quarrel.
The letter was written from Independence,
Iowa., and reads:
"Ten years ago, while living In a town
not far from Buffalo, I was engaged to
Miss Margie Hunter, and we were about
to be married when a small dispute arose
and in a moment of anger she insisted on
breaking the engagement. As every one
knew we were to be married In a few
weeks I was 'deeply chagrined, and the
next day left town, going to Colorado and
securing work In a mine.
"I heard occasionally from my old home
and learned that the girl with whom I
was so deeply in love had moved with her
parents to Iowa. I never heard directly
from her and, of course, never wrote her.
After a few years I lost all track of her.
Early In August, with a party of friends,
1 was visiting the Fan-American, and in
the course of sightseeing cam$ into your
big tree. The side walls were covered
with names and addresses. I was about
to write mine on the only space I could
see that was not covered, when, I dis
covered the name, Margie Hunter, Inde
pendence, Iowa.
"Next day I wrote her from Buffalo,
telling her of the peculiar way I had dis
covered her whereabouts. She promptly
replied, asking me to call and see her on
my way home, which is in La Junta, Col.
This I did. The invitation to the wedding
which I inclose tells the rest."

Catarrh
Cured
*
Some people have had catarrh as long
as they can remember â to cough, choke
and constantly gurgle and expectorate
is a regular habit â sort of second na-
ture, but vile and annoying.
Catarrh in the head is an inflamed
condition of the mucous membranes in
the nasal passages, often caused by a
cold.
Now, unless this inflammation is
drawn out, the catarrh will continue to
do endless damage. It will rot the
bones in the nose, cause deafness, injure
the sight, cause a foul breath.
Indigestion will also follow, for the
stomach has work of its own without
trying to digest the foul chunks of de-
cayed matter that slide down the throat
from the head while the sufferer is
asleep.
Halpruner's Wonderful Medicine
cures catarrh, drives the inflammation
out of the body, purifies the blood â
gives tone and vigor to the membranes
and health to the whole system. It
cools, allays and heals and you are well
in short time at very small cost.
Go to your druggist and ask for
and be sure that you get it Many
druggists will try to talk you out of
Halpruner's because they want you to
take some concoction they have mixed
in their cellars or back room. Some of
them even go so far as to label their
bottles with the names of Eastern con-
cerns to further mislead you. Beware
of the druggist that tries to talk you
out of purchasing Halpruner's.
If vou will telephone to Bush 463. HaJ-
pruner Medical Manufacturing Co., 28

to you.

Oakland won the game from Los An
greles by default yesterday at the end of
the tenth Inning with the score standing
3 to 3. The events leading up to this re*
suit were of a sensational character.
They furnished an afternoon of great
sport for the followers of baseball so
fortunate as to be present, providing one
of the greatest struggles of the season.
The Los Angeles aggregation could not
hit Schmidt, the Oakland pitcher, until the
ninth, when they tied the score, running
up three tallies. In the first half of the
tenth Oakland went out quickly. The
best it could do was to send Mohler to
second.
Then the fireworks commenced. Reitz
and Hemphill went out for Los Angeles at
once. Householder got a pass to first
and stole second and third as the ball
was lost. It hit the catcher's mask and
rolled off toward Oakland's bench. Kihm
also got a pass to first, by design, as the
Oaklands were waiting- to get Kelly at
bat, believing him. to be a weak man with
the stick.
At this stage of the proceedings the
Oakland men used every device to delay
the gaxne In order that it might be called
on account of darkness. All their shoe
laces seemed unloosed as if by magic
and required a lot of attention. Tne mem
bers of the team also entered into heated
arguments with one another about noth
ing in particular.
Atherton. who was batting for C. Rellly,
preceded Kelly at the hat. He is one of
the strongest of the Los Angeles hitters.
Earlier In the game he was robbed of a
possible three-base hit by Streib, who
made a sensational running catch of his
fly over near the right-field fence.
Schmidt. Oakland's pitcher, tried to pass
Ath?rton to first. This angered the man
from the South. He finally stepped out of
the box and hit safely down the line past
first base. Householder came home on the
hit and the Los Angelas rooters became
almost hysterical. Umpire Hardie quickly
put a damper on their spirits by calling
Atherton out for stepping out of the bats
man's box. thus retiring the side. The
Los Angeles players then sulked. The
umpire took out his watch and as they
were not ready to play when he called
time on them he awarded the game to
Oakland. The score:

With all respect for Mr. Huggins' opinion,
we were not dealing with Reiff on what he

what he did at the finish. Regard for Mr

ALL REAL INTEREST GONE.
English. Press Congratulates America
on Having the Better Boat.
LONDON, Oct. 4.â For Britishers all real in
terest has now dropped from the international
yacht races. Their only desire Is to get the
matter ended. "If we are to be thrashed
again," says the Daily Chronicle, "we had
rather take our gruel at once with all the
good humor at command."
In short, the editorials published this morn
ing do not make the slightest attempt to ex
plain the defeat. They frankly admit that the
Shamrock II was beaten in her own weather
and under conditions most favorable to her
and they congratulate America on being pos
sescod of the better boat.
i "As a matter of fact," remarks the Dally
Graphic, V on none of the former â¢ occasions
when the boats have met has the Shamrock
II ever been so far in front of the Columbia
as to have her time allowance in hand."
The Daily Mail says: "The Columbia has
demonstrated her superiority on all points of
sailing."
The Standard says: "Apparently there was
nothing to choose between the contesting cap
tains and men in point of Judgment and smart,
ness. Therefore the result was decided solely
by the Intrinsic capacity of yachts. The Sham
rock is a very fine boat, but not quite enough
for the defender. Tet the Interval between them
was not great enough for despair."
LONDON, Oct. 3â The extent of Great
Britain's disappointment at the defeat to-day
of the Shamrock II can be thoroughly appre
ciated only by those who saw the thousands of
spectators lining the embankment. Almost to
a man they were expectant of victory. The
early editions of the afternoon newspapers an
nouncing that it was the Shamrock's weather
had keyed up hopes here almost to a pitch of
?Â£ * a ,1. ty and many pe Â°P le entertained the idea
that, the depression over South African affairs
might be relieved by a victory of the Sham
rock II.
The latter* s lead in the early part of the
race so strengthened this impression that Lon
don threatened a repetition of Mafeklng night,
ihe crowds greeted the green lights on the
towers and on the launches which paraded the
Thames with wild delight.
But Columbia's red slowly crept up and
motor cars with megaphones dashed up and
down the embankment proclaiming Columbia's
lead. The yachts in the Thames reversed the
position of their lights and those on the signal
towers were changed. : The crowds stood await
ing the final messages. America's cup dinners
were advertised at the embankment hotels and
overlooking the river many fashionable people
dined, watching the moving lights until red
from all sides was flashed out.
"Columbia wins!" was shouted through the
hotel corridors, and the throngs dispersed.

this campaign depended the election of a
Democratic Governor and a Democratic
President, and attacked so-called reform.
In the preamble and resolutions the con

With the wind forward on the port beam and
with a tiny Jib topsail set on the Shamrock
.and a much larger and better pulling sail on
the Columbia, the boats started out on the
first leg of the triangle. During the first few
minutes it was impossible to say whether the
Columbia was gaining or not. In the gusts
of wind she seemed to heel over less than the
challenger and also appeared to steer a slight
ly higher course. The wind, though heading
true from north-horthwest, varied in violence.
Occasionally a heavy squall would strike one
of the racers, causing her to heel, but taking
the mean of the puffs, neither could be said
to have been favored. It soon became appar
ent that the race was to be sailed in very
quick time. The gain of the Columbia, which
the . turn of the first mark proved she had
made, was almost imperceptible. Toward the
mark the wind had changed. The Columbia
with a lesser sail spread seemed to stand
stiffer than her rival, but there was little to
choose between them. They smothered along
toward the mark and when they rounded it the
Columbia had gained only twenty-two seconds..
The gybe on both craft was well done. Under
the same sail as they started, they both stood
for the second mark. The wind piped stronger
and in the strongest of the puffs the Shamrock
had to luff a little to ease her to the force of
the breeze. The Columbia, on the contrary,
was allowed to feel the full power of every
squall, never being eased, and it was this that
helped her ahead. In spite of the larger sail
spread of her antagonist she was never left
behind, but kept top with the challenger. It
became apparent at the time that the Colum
bia had sailed over one-half of the second leg
that she had saved her time and was, barring
accidents, a winner.
Her skipper, instead of nursing her through
the squalls, let her feel the strength of them,
while the Shamrock's larger spread of sail
caused her to make imperative luffs or else
carry away something. In a reaching breeze
closer, and finer sailing perhaps was never seen.
There were frequent occasions when the col-
The yachts heeled to a scupper breeze when
the preparatory gun was fired at 10:45. The Co
lumbia far to the eastward stood down be
fore the wind for the line; meanwhile the
Shamrock was circling around the lightship.
Before the warning ' gun was fired, ten min
utes after the preparatory signal, Columbia
was ahead and, not wanting to cross the line
too early, luffed up with her headsall, shak
ing until she almost stood still. This put the
Shamrock in the better position, < and wearing
close around, she crossed the line almost at the
gun. while the Columbia elected to cross con
siderably more than one minute behind. Many
experts thought that the Columbia would be
handicapped, but Barr was on the alert and
sent her acros3 the line in time to save him
self.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â The tow-out of the
racers from their anchorage to the starting line
was devoid of interest. There was no hea\y
swell to cause skippers anxiety about their bob
stays. Thus it was that the .Shamrock' set
the largest of her club topsails, ; and nothing
daunted, the Columbia followed suit. When
the preparatory gun was fired It waa clearly
evident that the Columbia cared little for the
start, which was made to leeward on a close
reach, the triangular course offering no bene
fit to the craft Â¦ first away. There was no
true battle for position.
The committee boat Navigator dropped anchor
in her usual place south of the lightship, at
10:30, and at that time both yachts, in tow
under bare poles, headed up in the wind and
hoisted their mainsails. Their headsails were
already in stops. The Shamrock was first to
cast loose from her tug and a moment later
her headsails were broken out from their stops
and she made a clean run for the lightship.
The Columbia, which had been hugging the
easterly end of the line, eased off sheeta and
stood for the mark. Signals were hoistea from
the committee boat that the course would be
triangular, which meant that there would be
two close reaches and one dead beat to wind
ward for home.
But the Columbia Outsails the Chal

Mr. Morgan said the combination of
Jameson and Sycamore was a hard onÂ© to

Captain Barr said:
"We won the race against a very
powerful adversary."
Captain Sycamore of Â¦ the Shamrock
simply said: â¢ Â¦ .
"We did our best, and were fairly beaten
by a better boat."
Captain Bob Wringe, who sailed the
Shamrock I in her race against the
Columbia in 1S99, said:
Edwin D. Morgan, the Columbia's man
ager, when seen on board the Park City
after the race, said:
"We won against an excellent foe. I
always thought such a day as this would
be a Columbia day. Both boats were
superbly handled. We have now two races

supposed to be Shamrock weather. There
was no reason why the Shamrock should
not win, and, therefore, I believe the
Columbia is the best racing yacht in the
world." â¢ â¢
Best Racer in the World.
Sir Thomas said that what he was most
disappointed about was the defeat of the
Shamrock in the windward work.
"We were all so sure she would do well
in that, and in such a breeze, but she
seemed to 'pound* too much."
He added that there would be no
changes in the trim or the sails of the
Shamrock.
"I am very much disappointed at the
result," added Sir Thomas, "and the only
consolation is that I know I have been
licked by a good, honorable opponent. 1
know that the wind was true and that the
Columbia won without any flukes."
When asked by a visiting yachtsman if
he felt despondent, Sir Thomas replied
pluckily:
"As long as the Shamrock flag flies
there is just as much fight in me, and
until I am beaten In the third race I am
just as hopeful."
Speaking of Designer Watson, Sir
Thomas said: -
"I feeL very much for Mr. Watson. He
has done his best, and if he does not
succeed it is simply because he has a
more able man to meet on this side In
Mr. Herreshoff. He has worked hard for
two years on this boat and he has
neglected nothing that he thought would
helj) her."
"1 admit frankly that I got licked by
the best boat, in a fair and square race,
and I maintain and believe that there la
not a better skipper afloat than Captain
Sycamore, nor a better crew than mine.
1 have as much esteem for my captain
and crew as when 1 came to this side, but
they can't do impossibilities. They took
as much out of the boat as could bÂ»
taken.
Sir Thomas Lipton, although plainly'de
pressed at the result, stood bravely at
the gangway of the Krin and bade cordial
adieu to his guests. He also entertained
a large party of yachtsmen and ladies
who visited the Erin after the day's
guests had departed.
When asked what he thought of the
race he said:
Lipton. Is Still Hopeful.
The rival crews cheered each other as
they were towed home behind their,
tenders, escorted by the whole excursion
fleet.
Within a half hour : after the conclusion
of the race the committee boat, in accord-,
anoe with the agreement to race dally
from now on, set the' signal for a race to
morrow. Â¦ .
pion, But, like a good, game sportsman,
after the Columbia went over the line, he
ran the American flag up to the forepeak
and fired a salute in its honor.
KIDNAPING CASE
MAY CAUSE WAR
Sir Thomas Lipton on the Erin did not
approach -within half a mile of the finish
line. He had seen his high hopes blasted
and probably did not care to be in at the
jubilation over the defeat of his cham-
In five minutes after rounding the sec
ond mark It was apparent that the Colum
bia was footing faster and pointing
higher. She went through Shamrock's lee
like' a quarter-horse. The rush of the
leviathians on the final tack was magnifi
cent. The excursion â¢ boats, black with
people from gunwale to pilot-house, gath
ered about the finish in a great horseshoe.
The great white flyer came on well in the
lead. The patriotic skippers with their
hands on their whistle-cords, could hardly
restrain themselves. As she swept across
the finish the din was soul-destroying.
Whistles split the air and steam sirens
wailed, drowning the crash of the bands
and the cheers of the people. The concert
of sound was terrific. Until after the gal
lant Shamrock, beaten, but not disgraced,
crossed a minute* and eighteen seconds
later, whistles and sirens were kept go
ing. When they died away the bands
could be heard playing "Columbia, the
Gem of the Ocean," "Yankee Doodle" and
other patriotic airs.
The steam yacht Corsair was the first
to signalize the American victory by set
ting the starry banner at her masthead.
By this time all the skippers had had
ample time to ransack their lockers, and
within a minute afterward every vessel
in the fleet was alive with American flags.
Leaving the first mark on the starboard
the racers gybed over the big booms and
went careening for the second mark, the
Columbia gaining slowly but surely. They
had covered the first ten miles in a little
over fifty minutes. When they swung
around the second stake they took in their
baby Jib topsails and hauled their wind,
for the beat home. Both yachts heeled'
until their underbodies were lifted high
out of the water and their lee rails dipped
a foot into the swirling billows.
Columbia Foots Faster.
there was no windward berth in a reach
where the boats could lay their course
straight for the mark, and that the posi
tion astern, where Barr could keep his
eye on every move of his rival, was the
commanding one.
He could watch Sycamore like a hawk,
knowing that when the gap between them
was closed the race was his. For the first
fifteen miles no human eye could tell
which boat, if either, was gaining, so
closely were they matched. But gradu
ally^it became apparent that the Colum
bia was overhauling thÂ».flying challenger.
Slowly, inch by inch and loot by foot, the
white boat gained. Both were going at
a terrific pace. The patrol fleet to wind
ward, steaming line ahead at intervals
of 400 yards, had no difficulty in keeping
the excursion fleet clear of the winged
giants. Everything in the fleet had to
crowd on steam to keep the racers in
sight and the gait at which they were
going left tugs and some of the steam
boats astern. The guide boat, which
started fifteen minutes before the racers,
dug out at full speed, but she- was hardly
able to log off the distance and get the
float overboard before the racers Â¦ were
upon her. While going out, the North
German Lloyd liner Deutschland, outward
bound to Cherbourg, went through the
edge of the excursion craft a half mile to
the southward. The fleet seemed
anchored, so fast she went, looking like
a big, swiftly moving summer hotel. In
twenty minutes she was hull-down on the
horizon.
As the yachts approached the outer
mark a stream of signal flags were set on
the revenue cutter Gresham, the flagship
of the patrol fleet, instructing them in the
universal language of the sea to change
direction by the right flank. The patrol
boats swung around to line of west and
charged down upon the excursion fleet.
The latter, with bells clanging in the en
gine rooms for more speed, turned tail
and the whole fleet rushed madly to lee
ward of the last leg of the course.

did not."
TAMMANY RULE
PROVOKES STORM
BOER COLLAPSE
NOW PREDICTED
The Yankee victory began with the
start, when the crafty Earr, by a system
of maneuvering, convinced his adversary
that he was trying to cross the line first.
Captain Sycamore promptly took the bait
and rushing his boat into position sent
her away almost in the smoke of the gun.
Thereupon Captain Barr, having accomp
lished his purpose, tacked about back of
the .line and held off for more than a min
ute. Then, with a flying- start, he went
over just before the handicap gun was
fired. Some of the patriots were disap
pointed until the experts explained that
Victory "With, the Start.
Reaching for the first mark, ten miles
down the Long Island shore, with the
wind abaft the beam, she gained twenty
two seconds. In the closer reach for the
second stake she gained thirty seconds,
and in the thrash to windward on the leg
home she gained exactly two minutes.
Not perhaps as thrilling as the remark
able contest of last Saturday, to-day's
race was, nevertheless, stirring from start
to finish, and as a marine spectacle it
could hardly have beÂ£n surpassed. It was
an Ideal October day at sea* There was
just enough frostiness to clear the atmos
phere and make the whole course visible
from shore. The breeze from the land
piled up little swells, but it was strong
enough to whip the froth out of the rac
ing waves until it whitened the face of
the sea. Its claws caught the black
smoke from the stacks of the excursion
fleet and the wiiite steam from their ex
haust pipes and tore them into fragments.
The ensigns and flags with which the ves
sels were dressed stood out like painted
boards. The tail, canvas-clouded racers
heeled as the wind smote them until their
crews could with difficulty keep their
footing on the slippery, sloping decks, and
the spurting spray was tossed thirty feet
high as they shook their lean noses free
from the foaming crests. On the thrash
to windward their decks were a smother
of white, and fountains of foam circled
away from their graceful bows. â¢
The wind to-day was strong- and true,
blowing about eighteen, knots from the
northwest, and at every point of. sailing,
except perhaps running- before the wind,
in which the defender has already "taken
the measure of the challenger, the.Yan
kee sloop proved herself abler than the
Watson model. From the time she crossed
the starting line, one minute and thirty
four seconds behind the mug-hunter, until
she picked up and passed the Ir4sh boat,
three miles after rounding the second
mark, the Columbia's pace was faster and
she behaved becter than her rival.
Wind Is Strong and True.
the foaming seas, Herreshoff's
white wonder, the Columbia, to-day beat
Watson's British creation, the Shamrock
II, over a triangular course of thirty
miles by two minutes and flf ty-two sec
onds, actual time. With the forty-three
seconds which the Irish sloop must allow
the t American boat on account of her
larger sail plan the Columbia won the
second race of the series by three min
utes and thir^-flve seconds.
The fastest race ever sailed in a cup
contest, it was noX only a royal struggle
from a spectacular point of view, but it
was absolutely decisive as to the merits
of the two racing- machines. There is not
a yachting sharp who witnessed the race
to-day who is not firmly convinced that
the defender is the abler boat, blow high
or blow low, beating, reaching or running,
and that Sir Thomas and hia merry Brit
ish tars are doomed to return home emp
ty-handed.
Again the ancient piece of silver, which
was brought noross the western ocean
fifty years ago, Is safe. ' Again American
supremacy in marine architecture has
been vindicated. Sir Thomas has been
wishing for a breeze that would bury the
Shamrock'3 lee rail, and to-day he had it,
just as hÂ«i hai a similar breeze in the
concluding race two years ago, when the
Columbia in a driving rinish beat the first
Shamrock over six minutes.

The marital infelicities of the Ledewigs
were under discussion in Judge Seawell'a
court yesterday afternoon, and It required
several hours f cr the witnesses summoned
by Ledewig, who is suing for divorce on
.the ground, of cruelty, to tell what they
knew of Mrs. I.edewlg^s behavior on the
14th and 15th of May at, the office of the
real estate firm of Bovee.Toy. & Sonntag,
where Lcdewig is employed as manager.
The suit is the result of the alleged bad
behavior of Mrs. Ledewig at the office
where her husband is employed last May.
H. P. Sonntag, Mark E. Lewis and G. D.
Toy, members of the firm, testified that
on the 14th and 15th of May, 1901, Mrs.
Ledewig came to the office and proceeded
to make -things decidedly uncomfortable
for her spouse and Miss Emma Ransome,
the stenographer, the young lady whom
she accuses of accompanying Ledewig to
French dinners and theaters.
On May 14, the witnesses testified. Mrs.
Ledewig- entered the office of the firm at
624 Market street, slapped Miss Ransome s
face, called her a "chippy" and threatened
to "fix" her. . . '
The witnesses also testified that she
called -her husband a "yellow dog" and
used very vulgar language, all of which
was corroborated by the clerks and col
lectors employed in the office.
The slapping evidently did not affect
Miss Ransome's appetite, for Mr. Lewis
told how she told him she was hungry,
and he escorted her to lunch "to protect
her from Mrs. Ledewig."
The same witnesses described the be
havior of Mrs. Ledewig the next day,
when, they said, she came to the office
shortly after 5 o'clock and by her vicious
manner caused them such fear that they
summoned a policeman. '
Mrs. Ledewig. continued the witnesses,
wore a short cape at that time, and when
the officer searched her he found a raw
hide whip concealed underneath it. The
Vv'hip was taken care of by Mr. Toy, who
brought it to the court to show that Mrs.
Ledewig meant business.
Frank Sexton, a roomer at the Ledewig
home, told how he followed Ledewig one
night because Ledewig's wife's sister was
interested, and. when asked by Attorney
Linforth if he was acting as private de
tective he replied, "You can call it that if
y The entire afternoon was devoted to
this sort of testimony, and the case was
continued until Monday at 2 p. m.

"It seems to me that Chief of Police Sul
livan ought to make a thorough investiga
tion into the death of Yeaxgruy, as I am
satisfied thnt ho was murdered."
"As he fell to the sidewalk two men.after
kicking him, dragged him down Minna
street and threw him in a doorway. I
quickly walked over to the unfortunate
fellow and found him bleeding from a. deep
gash in the throat. His head was -also
cut and realizing that he was seriously
hurt I had the ambulance summoned.
After Yearguy had been taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital I learned that he had
been first attacked in the saloon and then
thrown into the street.
"I was walking up Minna street on the
night of the trouble, and when near Fifth
1 saw Yearguy, whom I did not know, be
ing thrown out cf the saloon.
Jacob Yearguy, who was brutally beaten
by a gang of men at Fifth and Minna
streets last Monday night, died in the
City and County Hospital yesterday from
his injuries.
According to several witnesses of the
assault Yearguy was drinking in a saloon
at Fifth and Minna streets -when he made
some flippant remarks about the strikers.
There were a half dozen men in the saloon
at the time and as Yearguy uttered the
rem.irk they attacked him. After giv
ing him a severe beating his assailants
threw him out of the saloon and as he
fell his head struck against the curb
stone, fracturing- his skull. Shortly after
ward the unfortunate man was found ly-
Ing in a doorway about twenty feet from
the saloon and removed to the Receiving
Hospital. After his wounds were tempo
rarily dressed he was sent to the City and
County Hospital, where he died yesterday.
Al Hoffman, a mining- engineer, was a
witness to the assault. When seen last
night he said:
After Being Assaulted He Is
Left Unconscious in â¢
a Doorway.
Kicked anch Beaten in

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND.
A PROCLAMATION.
Paine'sCelery Compound
the National Remedy.
â
Endorsed by Leaders in
Every Walk of Life.
Present Wonderful Demand
the Result of Merit.
House of Representatives,
Jefferson City, Mo., Sept 2, 190L
Wells & Richardson Co.:
Gentlemenâ Paine's celery compound Is
the great national family remedy. I can
cheerfully recommend it. "Very truly
yours, EDWARD McKENNT.
Since the day when the great surgeon
and practitioner Professor Edward E.
Phelps, M. D., LL.D., announced the dis-
covery of the formula of Paine's celery
compound and .first prescribed it with in-
variable success in cases of nervous pros-
tration, insomnia. Indigestion, rheuma-
tism and other diseases that have their
origin in a. disordered nervous , system â
HON. EDWARD McKENNT.
the demand for this one remedy has gone
on steadily increasing, until to-day
throughout every civilized country more
bottles of the remedy are prescribed by
physicians and used by those Â¦who are
sick than of probably all other prepared
remedies combined.
Tho formula of Paine's celery compound
â which Professor Phelps freely gave to
the medical profession â ranks in import-
ance in the medical world with the anti-
toxins and anesthetics.
Its discovery marks a new era in the
practice of medicine, as the discovery of
ether marked a new era In the practice,
of surgery-
The above unsolicited testimonial from
the Hon. Edward McKenny is one of
thousands which might be published.
In calling for Paine's celery compound
be sure that no quack medicine of pat-
ented name Is palmed off on you in Its
stead.Â£Â° COUP â¢â¢ 138% Do.2d3 .81

Chicago Grain Market.

CHICAGO, Oct. 3.â Conditions favored an ad
vance in corn at the start. The cables were
unchanged and there was a scarcity of offer
ings, which caused December to open % to V 4 c
higher, at 56%Â©56%c Though there was little
trading there was an Inclination on the part of
recent long liquidators to reinstate.- The
scantiness of offerings pointed to a considerable
shortage outstanding and December corn ad
vanced to 57%c. The bear crowd, while not
telling, was inclined to antagonize the advance
and late in the session, when a report that the
Iowa crop report would give a condition of 70,
against September's 50, prices began to sag
and December closed easy, %c higher, at 56%c.
Wheat followed the lead of. corn in a dull and
weak market. December opened a shade to %@
%c higher, at 69<Â§69%c, on better cables and the
buoyant feelings in corn. >Most of the traders
deserted the wheat pit for corn and what little
business there was was among scalpers. When
corn advanced wheat followed and later when
corn sagged wheat dropped in sympathy. De
cember closed weak, %@'4c lower, at 68%c.
Oats were dull, but firm. December closed
easy, %c higher, at 35%c.
There was almost no interest in provisions,

The weekly report of the climate and crop
service of the Weather Bureau on the Oregon
crops is as follows:
"The r^st week in Oregon has been unusually
Â¦wet. The night temperatures were seasonable,
but during the daytime the excess in
cloudiness caused the temperatures to
average about 10 degrees below normal.
The maximum temperatures during the
Â¦week in Western Oregon ranged between
53 and 66 degrees and the minimum between 44
E:id Â£2 degrees. In Eastern Oregon the maxi
mum temperatures ranged between 50 and 68
degrees and the minimum between 32 and 50
degrees. Sharp frosts occurred In Kastern Ore
gon on several mornings and an occasional
light frost was reported from the western por
tion of the State. These frosts did no damage
of consequence, bb the staple crops of the State
had been secured before they occurred. The
rains have been unusually protracted, and they
have done some damage to prunes by bursting
them and also delayed the work of harvesting
the crop, but the benefits derived from the
rains have been much greater than the losses
The rivers have all risen to a good boating
Etage. the ground is now thoroughly saturated
end fit for fall plowing and a new growth of
grass has started in the pastures and ranges.
The following is the total rainfall reported at
Weather Bureau stations during the week: As
toria, 1.94 inches; Portland, 1.53 inches; Rose
burg, 0.S4 of an inch; Baker City, 0.S3 of an
inch.
"The ground ie in excellent condition for fall
plowing and seeding, and this work is well
under way. although it has been more or less
interrupted by showers.
"The harvest of sugar beets is general. The
crop is good and the quality above the average.
The sugar factory has started and is now run
ning night and day.
"High winds during the week have caused a
great many apples to fall in the coast counties, '
and the crop in that section of the State will
be light."

"Opening prices on new California raisins
were made yesterday afternoon at 3%c, 4%c and

are very low and the trade placed orders
freely.
"There -waB a very fair trade yesterday on
epot, but outside of seedless Muscatel raisins
buying was practically entirely confined to
small or medium sized lots. Seedless continue
to be wanted by mince-meat men and further
sales of about two cars were reported, while
there was a fair request ror smaller than car
lots at 6%c. Only a few cars of the 27 bought
on the coast by a local syndicate some time ago
and brought to this market are said to be still
unsold. Seeded raisins in cartons are in good
request at 7%*?7*ic. Some goods 'without the

"Spot prunes are in some request. The car of

taken to-day for an overhauling and a re
adjustment generally of current quotations for
Industrial stocks. An extensive assortment
came under the purview of the professional
traders on the exchange, who went systemat
ically throug-h the whole list with a testing
process of what is called "offering down."
If no purchaser was forthcoming for a stock
at the last quoted prices it was offered at
successively lower prices until the making of
a purchase fixed the new price level. The
results of this process demonstrated a barren
ness of the public appetite for these securities,
which is a revelation to many- persons who
have been Impressed with the quoted prices
ruling in the market. These prices in many
cases were made during the period of active
speculation, when purchasers could be at
tracted by the mere device of a sudden ad
vance in market quotations. Actual transac
tions in a number of the securities have been
few and far between for many months past.
To-day's operations revealed the fact that the
supporting; orders which were Kept in these
stocks while there was any hope of outside
1-urchases had been entirely withdrawn and
the quotations crumbled away into fragments
under the offering down process above de
scribed. Some of the sufferers in the various
movements were affected by specific develop
ments, such as declining earnings and actual
or .threatened new competition, but the whole
class of stocks was too generally affected for
any explanation to suffice except one of gen
eral application. Of course the results amount
to a clear demonstration that ruling prices
have been the result of flagrant manipulation.
The severe speculative losses caused by the
recent collapse in the price of Amalgamated
Copper is probably the immediate cause of
the spirit of distrust engendered against the
industrials as a class. The action of the
United States Steel Corporation on Tuesday
in publishing aÂ» statement of monthly net
earnings induced a feeling that other indus
trial corporations must follow suit or suffer
loss of confidence. A statement of the extreme
declines recorded will serve to complete the
story of the day. These were: National Fait,
15 l i. no sales of the preferred, but quoted at
55(g60 at the closing, compared with the pre
vious sale of 75H: International Power, 32%;
New York Airbrake, 7*4; Glucose, $%; Bargen
County Gas and United States Rubber pre
ferred, 5; National Lead preferred, 3%; Amer
ican Wool preferred and United States Rub
ber common, 3%: American Smelting, 3*4:
Tennessee Coal. Twin City Rapid Transit and
People's Gas, 3. The list of industrial stocks
which declined from 1 to 2 is too long for
specification here. The railroad list was ex
tremely dull and rather sluggish, but it is
â¢significant of the spirit of the speculation that
New York. Chicago and St. Louis second pre
ferred relapsed 5V4 points, the common 3^4,
and the other Vanderbilts from 1 to 2 after
their recent manipulation. The whole market
closed active and weak after showing some
resistance during the day owing to the weak
ening effect of the industrials.
Railroad bonds were irregular. Total sales,
par value, $1,990,000. -
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Chicago was steady, with a good
cash demand. Inquiries having been sent out
to conservative millers throughout the West
as to whether it were true that wheat and low
grade flour were being fed to stock, it appears
from their answers that such is the case. The
low grade flour is run into mill feed, and con
siderable wheat is being fed to stock. This ex
plains the light receipts of winter wheat. This
feeding must soon become a factor in the mar
ket. .Minneapolis stocks will probably V in
crease 300,000 bushels for the week. Heavy
frosts were predicted for the Central West
St. Louis reported a good deal of long wheat
coming out. â¢ . .Â¦ â¢ â¢

carried up by the fancy brands. Cheese has
not changed for some ' time.

for Eggs, though there has been a steady ad
vance for some time.. There is no accumula

rain and some Intended for the East have been
diverted to this market on this account. The
poor condition of the' fruit interfered with the
shipping demand for the north yesterday.

ket was steady.

The shipping demand for fruits continues
good and dealers have no complaints to make
on this score. Mail reports from New York,'
published, elsewhere, indicate a slow improve
ment in the demand for Prunes, following the
receipt of the first lot of new crop in that
market. Raisins continue very unsettled, ow
ing to the lack of 'co-operation among the
growers and packers, which makes Eastern
buyers wary about taking hold.

of the Bond Exchange. Honokaa recovered
from its decline of the day before and sold
up to $10 37%, the lowness of the quotation
attracting buyers. Market Street Railroad

is due to the fine condition of the company
and the unvarying regularity of its dividends.

stocks, though prices showed little change.

THE first military appointment of
note by President Roosevelt is
that of Lieutenant Colonel L. rL
Rucker, whom the President
named yesterday for a colonelcy.
This appointment is of interest to Califor
nia, which may be considered the home
State of Lieutenant Colonel Rucker, for
here his family resides, though the of
ficer himself is on duty in the Philippine
Islands.
The appointment of Rucker was made
to fill the vacancy in the Eighth Cavalry
caused by the retirement of Colonel Bell,
the famous Philippine scout. Rucker was
chosen from among the line officers on
duty in Uncle Sam's island possessions.
At the outbreak of the war with Spain
Rucker was ordered to the Philippines,
where he made a brilliant record in the
field. He had already acquired a reputa
tion as an Indian fighter with the Ninth
Cavalry, and to this- he added in the Fili
pino insurrection. His regiment was the
first in the islands and the first home. In
1900 he was made acting superintendent of
the Yosemite National Park, making an
admirable superintendent. In March of
the present year he was made Lieutenant
Colonel of the Sixth Cavalry and again
ordered to the Philippines, where his spe
cial service in the establishment of civil
government In the islands brought him
his appointment as colonel at the hands
of President Roosevelt. Colonel Rucker
will now be ordere to Cuba to join his new
regiment. **

The Eureka Company will erect works
with 'a capacity of 1000 barrels of cement
daily and will employ about 300 men. The
price paid for the Dickie property was
$20,000. In addition to the land rights of
way have been secured over adjoining
tracts a distance of two miles to the
Southern Pacific Company tracks for a
private railway.
The projectors have organized the Eu
reka Portland Cement Company, and
among the incorporators are the follow
ing wealthy San Francisco firms: John
Rosenfeld's Sons, Pope & Talbot. Good
all, Perkins & Co. and John D. Spreckels
& Eros. Company. The company is capi
talized for $1,000,000. the entire amount of
which has been subscribed.
BUISUN, Oct. 3.â One of the most im
portant deals in real estate ever recorded
in Solano County was closed to-day, when
a deed for 149 acres of land was made by
A. A. Dickie to John Rosenfeld's Sons of
San Francisco. The property is located
about five miles northeast of Suisun and
contains immense deposits of lime rock,
which has stood successful tests for the
manufacture of Portland cement. Messrs.
Ro.senfeld were induced to take an op
tion on this property several months ago
by E. Dinkelspiel of Suisun, who had pre
viously caused experiments to be made of
the rock.
The responsibility of conducting the in
vestigations was intrusted to R. H. Dool
in. a San Francisco cement expert. While
sinking shafts and drilling test holes
through the rock Mr. Doolin discovered
that an immense deposit of blue clay un
derlies the lime rock and extends to oth
er portions of the tract. All that is re
quired for the manufacture of Portland
cement has been found on the place, and
the work of the erection of factories will
soon begin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Miss Earle's resignation was read and
accepted unanimously. It is as follows:
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 3, 1901.
Berkeley Board of Educationâ Gentlemen: I
wish to tender my resignation as teacher of
the stenographic department of the Berkeley
Commercial School, to take effect October 4,
1901, owing to the fact that the principal and
- myself cannot agree. I am willing to render
my services after that date until some one is
secured to take my place. Respectfully.
GERTRUDE EARLE.
Mr. Atherton's resignation, immediate
ly following, was accepted by the board.
The board then adjourned.
Miss Earle presented hery resignation
this morning and afterward received the
letters written to her by Atherton. The
Directors had decided that as the prop
erty was hers it should be. returned as
soon as her retirement was assured. She
said to-night In reference to the letters:
If Mr. Atherton is reinstated I shall make the
letters public and fight to the end and I shall
win. If he is kept out I shall say nothing, but
forget that the affair ever happened or that the
school ever existed.
Statement to Pupils.
This morning Superintenderit Waterman
and President Little, immediately after
securing Miss Earle's resignation, closed
the shorthand department and dismissed
the pupils until after the vacation of next
week. At that time it will reopen under
a new instructor. Superintendent Water
man went before Mr. Atherton's class
and made the following statement:
In justice to Mr. Atherton I want to say to
you that any statements made to the effect that
he has been dismissed from the department are
false. It is true that there is trouble In this
school. We had hoped that it would escape
undue publicity. The present trouble was pre
cipitated by the ill-advised action of the stenog
raphy teacher in speaking of it before her class
yesterday. The shorthand classes have been
stopped until after next week's vacation, but
the school will continue throughout the year.
There is no doubt of that. The Directors do not
open a school to close it. In all this 'matter
they have acted fairly and have done what they
believe to be right. '
Miss Earle's Resignation.
Communications from Miss IJarle, charging
Sir. Atherton with certain unprofessional re
marks, also a communication from A. TV.
Atherton denying the same, and also a com
munication from Mr. Atherton charging ! Misa
Earle with incompetency and insubordination
were read. Resolved, That the resignation of
Mr. Atherton, now in the hands of the super
intendent, be produced at the next meeting of
the board for action. Passed unanimously.
The president was requested to ask Miss Earle
for her resignation. Passed unanimously.
The report was received and adopted
and the clerk wrote the following peti
tion:
To the Board of Directors: We the under
signed pupils and parents of the Berkeley Com
mercial School here express our wish to retain
the services of Mr. Atherton as our instructor,
realizing *his ability in the commercial depart
ment.
The petition was signed by forty-four
pupils and twenty-four parents.
President J. R. Little called the meeting
to order and requested Superintendent
Waterman as secretary to report the ac
tion of the committee of the whole, which
met In private session Tuesday night.
Superintendent Waterman reported as fol
lows:
Tuesday Night's Proceedings.
The board, in view of the resignations,
simply filed these communications. All of
the directors and Superintendent S. D.
Waterman were present at the meeting.
â¢ Berkeley Board of Education â Gentlemen: It
has developed since the election of Miss Ger
trude M. Earle that she la incompetent and
insubordinate. I am prepared to furnish nu
merous specific instances of both.
A. W. ATHERTON.
Principal Berkeley Commercial College.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 1, 190L
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 1. 1901.
To "the Berkeley Board of EducationâGentle
men: I understand that a paper has been
filed with you to-day by Miss Earle alleging
that I have said something out of the way
to her. I have not seen the paper, but beg
to state that any uncalled-for, unwarranted.
Intemperate or unprofessional remarks attrib
uted to me are absolutely false and a part of
a well-laid scheme to "break me in one way
if not in another." Respectfully. â¢
A. W. ATHERTON.
The chief development in the Berkeley
Commercial College upheaval to-night was
the making public of the proceedings at
the secret committee meeting Tuesday
night, when the charges and denials by
Miss Earle and Principal Atherton were
heard. There were three letters read, as
follows:
BERKELEY, Cal.. Oct. 1, 1901.
Berkeley Board of Educationâ Gentlemen: I
deem it necessary to report to the members of
the Board of Education the conduct of Prin
cipal A. W. Atherton. I make a direct charge
against him for not only threatening my life,
but that of every member of my family. To
day he insulted me as no gentleman could or
ever would, using: the worst and -most vulgar
language possible. He went so far as to tell
me he would slap my face and throw me head
long down the stairs â not only that, but mak
ing boasts as^to what he intended to do in
the way of blackening my character. Gentle
men, you may call on me for anything in con
nection with what I state. Respectfully,
GERTRUDE EARLE.
Letters in the Case.
BERKELEY, Oct. 3.-The Board of Ed
ucation to-night closed the scandal in the
Berkeley Commercial College, so far as
official cognizance went, by accepting the
resignations of Principal A. W. Atherton
and Miss Gertrude Earle of the steno
graphic department, who had charged her
superior with misconduct. The action of
the board had been forecasted. It was
sharp and decisive. Ten minutes' time
sufficed to cover the formalities of the
session, and when all was over, Miss
Earle, escorted by her father, and her for
mer friend, Atherton, disappeared from
the lobby, where, with scores of pupils of
the school and their parents, they had
been hearers of the proceedings.
The bunch of letters which form an ele
ment in the spicy pedagogical scandal
were returned to Miss Earle, who declares
she will retain the missives from the late
principal unless Atherton's friends at
tempt to secure his reinstatement. In
that case the young woman threatens
that she will tell the whole story, putting
letters and all under the limelight of pub
lic criticism.
' "I remember on one occasion we waited
a long time, for him to come down stairs
before saying prayers at the breakfast
table, and finally we had to say them
without him. After breakfast we heard
him up stairs, singing to himself, and
upon investigation I found that he only
had a nightshirt on. That was while he
was staying at my house."
"Did you ever receive letters from him
indicating anything wrong In him?"
"Yes. I received a letter from him of
many pages relating all his troubles, and
particularly referring to charges that had
been made against him for. being intoxi
cated. It was a very incoherent letter."
"Did he appear to you to 1 be logical or
illogical in his conversation?"
"Well, we couldn't agree always. He
probably thought he was logical and I
thought I was logical."
"Did you ever notice that he drank
liquor?"
"No. I never observed that he was in
toxicated, though, of course, I had heard
that he drank.'"
The Rev. Mr. Ely, who followed the
Rev. Mr. Hewitt, testified that he attend
ed the same college with Adams, but that
he had not met him for twenty-five years
after they graduated until 18%. when Ad
ams went to Cincinnati. He was instru
mental in getting Adams the rectorship
of a church in the suburbs of the city.
Not long after Adams was given charge
of the church he began to drink again
and was attacked with delirium tremena
and was taken to a sanitarium for treat
ment.
"Did you see Adams at the sanita
rium?"
"Yes. He was in bed, looking much the
worse for wear, but sober."
"Did you say anything to him?"
"Yes. I told him he couldn't stay at
the church any longerâ that I was respon
sible for him and that he would have to
go. He didn't combat the command X
gave him, but he seemed to think he
might go back."
John J. Bandman, a mining engineer of
San Francisco, and.V. B. Allen, also a
mining engineer, were the last witnesses
of the day. They testified concerning acts
of Adams and paid they considered him
Insane. The case went over until to-mor
row morning. The defense will probably
finish its case to-morrow, .when the prose
cution will begin putting in testimony in
rebuttal. .
Adams Was Eccentric.
The afternoon furnished something of a
surprise when two Episcopal clergymen,
who are visiting the coast as delegates to
the Episcopal Convention, were announced
as witnesses for the defense. One was the
Rev. John M. Hewitt, rector of Grace
Episcopal Church of Columbus, Ohio, and
the other the Rev. John A. Ely. rector of
Grace Episcopal Church of Cincinnati.
Ohio, both former associates of Charles
G. Adams, the last named having attended
the Baxley Gambia Theological Seminary
with him in 1869.
The Rev. Mr. Hewitt was the first wit
ness. He testified that he had met Adams
in 1871 while they were rectors of country
churches in Pennsylvania. They became
firm friends and frequently exchanged
pulpits.
"When you first saw Mr. Adams, Mr.
Hewitt, what was his manner?"
"He was a very earnest man and great
ly Interested in his work. He had a phil
osophical mind and was considered a bril
liant man. He preached over the heads
of his hearers â what I mean is, that his
parish was not a particularly brilliant one
and they didn't understand his sermons."
"What were his habits of dress when
you first saw him?"
"Well, when 1 first saw him he looked
as if he had come out of a bandbox, but
I noticed in 1856, when I last saw him,
that he was very slovenly in his appear
ance. But I didn't attribute this change
to drink. I thought he had merely ac
commodated himself to his environment."
"What was his demeanor when you saw
him in 18%? Was his conduct peculiar?"
"He was considered eccentric then. For
instance, he used to wear a silk hat and
a Prince Albert coat while riding around
in a, sulky, which perhaps no farmer
would do." â¢ . "
"Were there any other eccentricities
that you recall?"
Clergymen Testify.
"There was no improvement in hia
habits. His speech was moody and dis
connected. He continued to drink heav
ily and would cry out in his sleep."
"Do you remember any particular act
of violence on his part while there?"
"In December of 1898 he attacked with
out cause a negro who .was chopping
wood. We heard the sound of the chop
ping and father rushed out after the man
witn a revolver in his hand, threatening
to shoot him at once. The colored man
became very angry but I finally pacified
him and he went away."
"Did he do anything else that would
show that he was not in his right mind."
"Yes, On another occasion lit Hanford
he ran out of the house after he had pre
pared to retire and discharged a pistol in
the air. He said he was afraid of demons.
His eye was glassy and his hair stood on
end. After he came into the house he
trembled like a leaf."
Miss Adams said her father kept up hi3
drinking while at Hanford until he was
again on the verge of delirium tremens.
His actions became scandalous and fin
ally he was to leave the church.
Shortly after leaving the rectorshio he
was unfrocked by the Bishop. The attor
neys finished with Miss Adams just be
fore the noon recess and she gave a sigh
of relief as she left the witness chair.
"Yes. A portrait of Bishop Williams,
who was at time the presiding Bishop
of the Episcopal Church in the United
States, excited him very much and he used
to say that it was a. picture of the devil."
"While you were in Cincinnati was your
father an inmate of any asylum?"
"Yes. He was confined in a sanitarium
for some time to cure him of an attack
of delirium tremens."
"Did he have charge of a church at that
time?"
"He was the rector of a church in the
suburbs of the city."
"Where did you go after leaving Cin
cinnati?"
"We came to California in 1898. Father
was offered and accepted the rectorship
of the parish at Hanford."
"How did he act white there?"
Aversion for Bishop's Picture.
Miss Agnes S. Adams resumed her place
in the witness chair this morning in Judge
Mel vin's court to describe the many
drunken escapades of her father prior to
the shooting of Dr. John G. Jessup in
Berkeley. Miss Adams began at the point
wh?re she left off when the court ad
journed yesterday afternoon, after she
had related all that had occurred between
the time when her father first began to
drink in 1888 up to 1806, when the family
removed from Fremont, Ohio, to Cincin
nati. Miss Adams testified to a series of
events in the unfrocked clergyman's
career which revealed that he saw, during
the past five or six years of his life, very
few sober moments. He was almost con
tinuously under the influence of liquor and
he was unable to retain a rectorship for
any length of time because of his failing.
"How did your father conduct himself
after your family went to Cincinnati in
1896, Miss Adams?" asked Attorney
Church.
"Father drank worse than he ever had
after we went to Cincinnati," replied the
witness. "He had an attack of delirium
tremens there. He would imagine that
little devils were sitting upon the picture
frames in the rooms of our house and he
would scream frightfully at all hours of
the night.": t
"Did he manifest aversion for any par
ticular picture in the rooms?"

VANCOU VKK, B. C, Oct. 3.â Five
thousand Vancouver citizens gathered at
the depot this morning to speed the de
parting royal guests. There were no
lormalities and a number of citizens
greeted the Duke and Duchess of Corn
wall and York In true democratic fashion,
without being presented. Their royal
Highnesses chatted affably with all who
approached them.
The only matter of programme was the
reply of the Duke to an address pre
fcented to them three days ago by the
Port Simpson Indians. Upon his return
lrom Victoria this morning the Indians,
dressed in skins, with painted faces, a^
f-embied on the wharf and greeted the
Duke with profound veneration when he
landed from the steamer Empress of In
dia- Then the head chief doffed his mag
nificent headdress and presented it to
the Duchess. Her royal Highness turned
it over and over and thanked the Indians
again and again as she admired it.
The present was the "kiti-uia-shamor-
ETat," or "hat of the chiefs," an article
always recorded by them with the great
est veneration and of priceless value,
owing to its antiquity and associations.
The headdress takes the same place In
the minds of the Indians and Is as highly
venerated as the royal crown is by the
people of the British nation. It is in
fact called the crown of the Tsimpsian
tribes. It is made of hairs and bristles
pulled from the beards of seallons, and
the Indians claim that It has been In the
possession of their tribe for "hundreds
of generations." It wiU probably go to
the British Museum.
As the train pulled out thn Duke and
Duchess from the rear platform waved
their hands and bowed to the crowds.

Heirs "Wanted in Kansas City.
Captain Seymour received a letter from
Kansas City, Mo., yesterday asking- him
to find, if possible, J. Hurbart "Wisner
and his starter, Bertha, who is married as
they are heirs to an estate there valued
at $100,000. They are believed to be In this
city or State.
Â¦ Whereas,' We believe " that the most potent
remedy for such I evils is the expression and
vigorous enforcement of a clean and healthy
public opinion which will condemn and will
not tolerate the kind of Journalism that de
bases Instead of elevates; now, therefore,
Resolved, That the board, of trustees of the
Toung Men's Christian' Association of San
Francisco in a . Joint meeting held - this day,
October 3, 1901, do hereby express our' con
demnation and abhorrence ' of â¢ such " vulgar,
scandalous, wanton and wicked Journalism, and
that we bar their admission to the reading
room and library of our association; and we
hereby pledge ourselves and the body which
we represent to use every effort in persuading
our people to discontinue and withdraw their
support from the offending portion of the press,
and to^use every honorable effort to stamp out
and destroy that kind of Journalism In our
country. , - .: Â¦ Â» : â¢ . Â¦Â¦ :
Whereas The death of our late -beloved Pres
ident; William MoKlnley, at the hands of a
brutal and cowardly assassin, a representative
of a class of persons who are the avowed ene
mies of organized society and of all govern
ment has not only shocked and plunged into
the deepest sorrow the nation and the whole
Christian world, but has also brought home
to us a realizing sense of the great dangers
which threaten our most cherished institu
tions from vulgar and Incendiary teachings and
the dissemination of disrespect and contempt
for the constituted authorities of our Govern
ment; and
Whereas. The spirit of lawlessness which
leads up to such a direful calamity as the
murder of the President of the United States
can have no Justification, even the most re
mote, in a free, democratic and Christian na
tion; and .. Â¦.
Whereas, It Is our belief and conviction that
the responsibility for the conditions that make
such crimes possible is largely due to the vul
gar, scandalous, wanton and wicked sensa
tionalism of a portion of the press, which,
instead of trying to educate and elevate the
people to higher Ideals in the great . princi
ples of morality, economics and* government,
constantly panders for selfish gain to the low
and brutal passions of the mob, and strives to
sow the seeds of discontent' and discord, and
to breed enmities among our people, needlessly
arraying one portion of our people against
another; and

' RETURNING FBOM RACES
The records of the San Francisco Police
Department and Morgue contain no ref
erence to a suicide such as is described in
the above dispatch, nor do the names
Lenson or Snyder appear.
Lenson says he then left San Francisco
for another town and there he heard the
report of the supposed suicide of his
sister. â¢ When it was all over he traveled
about. The thought of having murdered
his sister weighed so on Lenson's mind
that he Is now at times a maniac.
Finally, ten months ago, Lenson says
he came across his sister on a street in
San Francisco. He stopped her and tried
to persuade her to leave the man. Later
they went to a room to talk the matter
over. There, Lenson declares, he- shot his
sister. He left the revolver by her side
and then wrote a note in her style of
handwriting saying that she had become
tired of the life she was leading and de
cided to commit suicide. To this he signed
his sister's name.
LEAVENWORTH, Kas., Oct. 3.â The
Leavenworth police have encountered a
queer proposition in the person of J. R.
Lenson, who was arrested last night by
Detective E. .C. Murphy. â¢ Lenson is at
times a raving maniac and again he is
perfectly sane. When placed in a cell in
the City Jail he tore all th'e clothing from
his body.
"While in a rational condition during the
night he recounted a most remarkable
story of himself to the police. He says
that about fourteen months ago his sister
ran away with a man named Snyder Â¦ of
Pittsburg, Pa., against the will of her
family. Lenson determined to separate
the pair and started in pursuit of them.
He says he followed them all over the
United States, but they always eluded
him.
