LEADVILLE, Colo., June 9.â Winfield
B. Btratton. the millionaire mineowner of
Cripple Creek, has .redeemed the Match
less mine, in Leadville, for the widow of
the late Senator Tabor in fulfillment of
the promise he was reported to have
made several days ago.
The story of this action of the Cripple
Creek magnate is fraught with an abund
ance of romance. Years ago Senator
Tabor advanced some money to Stratton
when Stratton was a poor struggling
miner, and he never forgot it. When
Tabor died he had lost almost everything
and he was vainly endeavoring to save
the Matchless mine, which he always In
sisted still contained millions In Its lower
contacts sever explored. The I property
was sold some months ago at Sheriff's
sale, and final title would pass on July.
4 to the new:owners. . *"-.
For a year past Mrs. Tabor has been
endeavoring to save the mine, but despite
the fact that there are hundreds of. people
In Colorado that Tabor helped when he
was rich, she could not raise the money.
Stratton heard of her trouble and as
sured her that If the title to the property
was all right he would assist her. " The
title is clear, and a, check for $15,000 will
be paid over to-morrow arid the title. will
revert to Stratton, who will on July, 4
turn the mine over to Mrs. Tabor. : It
was on July 4 that Stratton discovered
the Independence mine, which made him
famous, ' and * It ' Is a strange coincidence
that on that day he will return a kindness
to the widow and fainlly of the man who
helped him when he waa poor.
Senator Tabor was one > of the best
known characters of the "West. He spent
his millions freely and died a. poor man.
It was he who gave the city of Denver
its first start. .

Chief of Detectives Will Make No

Prisoner's Statements Are
Contradictory.^ â¢ -"Â¦', '<
Harry Jackson, assistant janitor at the
Page-street Armory, whose ' . name was
mentioned in connection with the brutal
murder of Robbie Hislop, was arrested
yesterday-- by order of Captain Seymour
and locked up In the tanks , pending a 1
thorough investigation into his move
ments on the night of the awful, tragedy.
For several hours yesterday .afternoon
Edward Linehan, who lives at Octavia
and Oak streets, and Jackson were in the
office of the Chief of Detectives undergo
ing what Is known In police - parlance as
the "sweating", process. Notwithstand
ing the reticence of Seymour arid his men
it is known that the two men were sub
jected to the most'" rigid examination.
After.it was over Seymour released Llne
han but ordered Jackson locked up. "
On the evening of the murder Jackson
and Linehan engaged In a ' fight in the
armory, the last named getting the worst
of the encounter. After leaving the scene
of the. battle Linehan went; to his home
arid securing a hatchet started to return
to the armory. On the way he met an
attorney named Ed Shortall. who upon
learning that Linehan intended to kill
Jackson took the hatchet from him.
Linehan was seen by- several persons
walking along the street ; with his face
bathed In his own blood. Thinking that
he might have had something to do with
the murder, of young Hislop those who
noticed his condition lost no time in no
tifying the police. He was closoly. ques
tioned at the time, but as it" was- evident
that ' he was innocent of, any] connection
with, the murder he was not ferrested. . .
i Just what evidence the
against. Jackson,"! "Â¦.Captain : Seymour -'''re-'
fuses to -state. 'When â¢questioned last
night the head of the 'detective depart
ment iaughingly remarked that he was
justified In arresting Jackson* as he was
a deserter from the cruiser Philadelphia.
"Do you suspect him of having any
thing to do Â¦with the murder?" was asked.
"I have nothing to say at the present
time," he answered. "I have seen fit to
detain Mr. Jackson, and that is all there
is to it."
Jackson prior to Joining, the navy was
a member of Company A. First California
Infantry. 1 He returned from Manila with
his health greatly impaired, but soon re
covered.
While admitting that he and Linehan
had a fight on the evening of the killing
of little Robbie Hislop, Jackson denies
any knowledge of the murder.
"Linehan and I had a , wordy \argu
ment," he said last night, "and blows fol
lowed. .1 soon convinced him' that I was
far cleverer with my fists, and he quit.
Some time afterward I heard that he had
a hatchet which he â¢ intended to use on
me, but I religiously kept out of his way.
I was greatly pleased when I was told
about an hour later that the hatchet had
been taken ,Â» Way from him, as I was
afraid that he would hurt me with it.
"I know absolutely nothing about the
murder of young Hislop, and am at a loss
to understand why the police see fit to
detain me." ' . . ,'..'.- *

SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY;, JUNE 10; 1901.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.'WASHINGTON, June 9.â The slight Im
provement in Mra. McKlnley's health
which manifested itself the latter part
of the week continues, and hope begins to
be felt that she may after all recover
from the present attack. The improve
ment, however, is so slight as not to
change materially the extreme gravity
of the case. The usual consultation oC
the physicians . was h^eld this morning,
and at its close the following bulletin
was issued:
11:13 a. m.â Mrs. McKlnley's physicians re
port that she passed a very comfortable night
and continues to tmorove.
The fact that Mrs. McKlnley has mora
than held her own and that no unfavor
able turn has occurred Is considered In
every way encouraging-, but as this re
sult is due . partly to the constant use o'
powerful medicines the physicians fear
the effect of reducing the stimulants, and
likewise have to cope with the effect on
her system of the constant administra
tion of the only means of prolonging her
life and making ultimate recovery at
least a possibility. These stimulants and
the complaint from which she suffered in
California, which is now under better con
trol, have so weakened her powers of re
sistance that apprehension is ever pres
ent that a sinking spell may occur sud
denly from which she cannot be rallied.
Dr. Rixey regularly makes three visits
each day, one in the morning, when
there is a consultation of physicians; an
other in the afternoon and a third in the
evening. He called this afternoon about
3 o'clock, and finding Mrs. McKlnley
comfortable and progressing as well as
could be expected he and the President
went out for a long drive, lasting more
than an hour and a half, both going to
the sick room at once upon returning.
Subsequently tl.e doctor said that no ma
terial change had occurred since the
morning bulletin.
Friends, official and personal, of the
Presidential family, continue to show
their sympathy by personal inquiries at
the door and by leaving their, cards.
Even the members of the Cabinet, as a
rule, merely leave their cards in order to
avoid disturbing the patient. Mr3. Charles
Emory Smith, Secretary Long, Lieuten
ant General and Mrs. Miles. Assistant
Secretary of War Sanger and Miss Hitch
cock were among those who thus ex
pressed their sympathy during the day.
Dr. Rixey after his visit to the Whits
House to-night said on leaving at 10:30
o'clock:
"Mrs. McKlnley is slowly improving.
She is resting very comfortably now and
is doing very nicely."
Mrs. McKinley will be taken to Canton
whenever she is In condition to make tho
Journey. Extensive improvements have
been made at the McKinley home in Can
ton, and it was planned last autumn that
she and the President should go to Can
ton about July 1 of this summer. In case
of Mrs. McKlnley'a recovery this plan
1 will be carried cut, though it is not ex-
I pected she would be strong enough to
I .leave here the 1st of July, even if im-
I provement should continue steadily.

NEW YORK. June 9.â That army offi
cers should continue their schooling as
long as they are In the service of the
United States is the policy urged on the
Government by Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheel
er president of the University of Califor
nia, who has Just come to New York after
spending a week at West Point as one of
the President's representatives on the
Hoard of Visitors at the United States
Military Academy.
"Army officers ought not to regard their
education as ended on their graduation
from West Point." said President Wheel
or to-day. "They are professional men
and a system should be established by
which they may from time to time engage
in systematic professional studies to
bring' themselves abreast of the times.
"West Point is the best military school
in the world. It represents the liberal
military education, as contrasted with the
extreme specialization of the military
schools of France. Germany and Russia.
The West Point cadet is soundly trained
5n the foundation principles of all the four
great branches of the service â engineer
in?, artillery, cavalry and infantry.
"But in provision? for keeping our offl- I
cers in touch with advancement in their
profession we lag: behind other countries. 1
The necessity of spending several thou
sand doliars a year more than his income
which devolves upon the military attache
at an American legation abroad makes it
possible for only a few of our officers to
onjoy this great opportunity to learn.
Once in four years every officer should
have a furlough of from four to six
months to study foreign military meth
ods."

CHICAGO, June 9.â Twelve hundred
dollars may be an extravagant sum to pay
for a canary,- but Louis M. Hedges of 59
Warren avenue does not think so. He says
that he considers a bird sufficiently pa

worth even more. Â¦ Â».
Mr. Hedges has just purchased a two

in St. Joseph; Mo. It appears O'Brien,
while sitting at his bench, varied his peg
driving by whistling "Yankee Doodle."
The canary sat perched in its cage direct

Moore acquiesced, with the result that an
advisory committee, consisting of him
self. Secretary Lawall and Press Agent
Marvin, was appointed to have full con
trol at the exhibition.
Secretary Lawall returned from Buffalo
yesterday, bearing. information that Com
missioner Moore has disregarded' the
wishes of the advisory committee and has
tried personally to control the display. It
is claimed he has issued checks without
the knowledge of other members of the
advisory committee, and that the entire
work has been badly handled. ,For in
stance, lumbering, the State's greatest in
dustry, is absolutely unrepresented at
Buffalo, and the commission had to ar
range to-day by wire to make a pigmy
forestry exhibit of two Â¦ carloads.*
It was also learned that one shipment
of freight remains unsent at the Tacoma
depot because Moore failed to arrange to
pay. charges on the same.-' The situation
was thoroughly discussed by Levi.Ankeny

night. Finalactlon will be taken at an

OF A THIRD TERM FOR McKINLEY
It Is rather, to be regretted that James
Neill has chosen to give as his last week's
programme Â¦ "A Parisian Romance," pre
sented at the California Theater to a fair
ly good house. last night. Neither for Mr.
Neill nor for any member of his good
company, is there a part in the play that
fits with any degree of comfort. That of
Baron Chevrial, roue, cynic, courtier, is
several sizes too large for Mr. Neill him
self, whose fatal amiability simply smoth
ers every sinister, suggestion in the part.
Not a creep, nor a shadow of a suggestion
of a thrill. is there in the conception from
beginning to end.. His villainy does^ not
horrifyâit is too patently assumed; his
tyranny does not enrage â it is too obvi
ously artificial; his greed does not con
vinceâhe - is â¢ too evidently - good-natured.
He is simply a rather amiable old person,
forced against his better nature by an
exacting playwright into a - wholly un
congenial naughtiness, . and quaintly re
liant on his audience's sympathy with his
underlying righteousness.
Julia Dean has an uncongenial part as
Rose Guerin, 1 * an actress, but does well
with such opportunity as lies in it. Miss
Chapman did - good -work as Madame de
Targy, and is well supported by Frank E.
Camp, who, as Henri | de Targy, gave a
manly and striking presentment of a
pleasing conception." Lillian 'Andrews,
Maude GorSon and Louise ' Brownell were
also pleasing, and John W. Burton took
good care of the part of Dr. Chesnel. The
piece is excellently mounted.
Frank Barton, Ethel Barlow and the
Samayoas are the Olympla's attractions
this week. .
At the .Columbia Theater this evening
Henry Miller will present, for the first
time en any stage an entirely new ro
mantic ! play, entitled "Darcy of the
Guards." This play has been in prepara
tion by Mr. 1 Miller and his company for
some time, and a \ production much out
of ; the -ordinary may be looked for. The
story deals with - people of 1777, and the
locale is Philadelphia at the time of
that city's occupancy by the British un
der Howe and Cornwallis. The title
role, played by Miller, is that of a
young Irish officer of the Grenadier
Guards, on the staff of Lord Cornwallis.
He falls in "love with a pretty colonial
girl, and their story is told most ef
fectively by the author.
The first production - in English i of
Saraou's play, "The Empress Theo
dora," will be given to-morrow night at
the Grand Opera-house, with Florence
Stone In the title role. Melbourne Mac-
Dowell will appear as Andreas, one cÂ»
the traitors to the Emperor Justininn,
with whom the Empress is in love. The
play has not been seen here since it
was given some years a^o by Bernnardi.
The play will be staged with the same
Ep'enaor that has dihtlngtifhed the set

Officer of Miles' Staff Who
Started the "Embalmed
PITTSBURG, Pa., June 9.-Major W. H.
JJaly. surgeon general on' the staff of Gen
eral Miles in Porto Rico, committed sui
cide at his home this morning: by shoot
ing himself In the right temple. The body
of the doctor was found in the bathroom
fry Miss Mary Short, the housekeeper, ly
ing in a pool of blood, with a SS-caliber
revolver near by. Dr. Foster, who was
summoned at once, found a bullet hole
in the temple and announced that death
n *5 taken place several hours before.
Jttiss Short remembered having heard a
fharp report about 7:30 a. m.. but believed
it was the quick closing- of a window.
>.o cause is known for Dr. Daly's deed,
unless it be that insomnia drove him tem
porarily insane. For some time he has
been unable to sleep reg-ularly.
The doctor was a widower and leaves
no immediate family. He was 59 years
of age, and for many years has been
prominent in medical eircles. He gained
international prominence during: the Cu
ban war, as it was his report to the com
manding general of the armv that started
the "embalmed beef" inquiry.
Lieutenant General Miles said to-night
that he was not surprised at the suicide
of Dr. Daly, in view of the great personal
bereavement that the doctor had suf
lered recently, and the undermining- of
his health by a severe attack of the grip
last winter. General Miles esteemed Dr.
Daly very highly and the two were inti
mate friends. His death came as a se
vere blow to the general.
Dr. Daly was in the city last March,
when he came to lw present at the second
inauguration of President McKinley. If
General Miles can arrange matters he will
attend the funeral of his old friend.
Surgeon Daly was a deputy to Assistant
Surgeon Charles 1. Greenleaf on the staff
<>f the commanding general during the
Spanish-American war. and General
Mijes testified to-night to the thorough
ness with which he performed his duties
in attending to the wants of the sick, car
ing for the wounded and establishing hos
pitals. It was due to Dr. Daly's allega
tions that the beef furnished the army
had been tampered Â¦with and preserved
with acids, which he alleged were detri
mental to the health of the soldiers, that
a board of army inquiry conducted the
celebrated beef inquiry during the Span
ish war.

REDWOOD CITY, June 9.â An answer
has just! been filed in an action brought in
this county by Josephine A. Phelps, exec
utor of the last . will and testament of
Timothy Guy Phelps, deceased, which
puts in issue the title to property valued
at more than $50,000. The suit was com
menced to recover $7120 and interest from
November 13, 1894, at 9 per cent per an
num, on a premissory note executed by
W. I. Wadleigh to T. G. Phelps. Accord
ing to the complaint neither the principal
of the note nor any part of the interest
has been raid.
The property involved in the answer
consists of real estate In Nevada County,
commonly known as the liberty Hill
mines; also real estate in San Francisco
and in the State of Washington. All of
this property stood In the name of Mr.
Phelps at the tima of his death, having
been deeded to him from time to time by
Wadleigh, . and was inventoried as. a parr
of his estate.* . .
While the deeds are absolute in form,
yet the defendant in this action contends
that they are but mortpages, having been
given* to secure i the promissory, note of
$7120 sued upon. . The answer further al
leges that the property .Is of the- value
of more tfjan_-$5Â© ,090. *.-Â¦*â¢- ."Â¦. ' ~. ? . V; Â¦--â¢ s
It is then set, out in' the 'answer that
after November 13, 1$94; It was agreed
that Timothy Guy Phelps might mine,
upon and 'work the properties in Nevada
County, and that all the. profits arising
therefrom' should be credited upon the
amount due upon the note for 17120, "and
that thereafter the said Timothy Guy
Phelps did mine and caused to be mined
said mining claims, and from the opera
tion of said mines received large sums of
money to his own use and to his own
benefit, which sums of money should have
been but never were indorsed or credited
upon said note." -
The defendant then asks that the plain
tiff be compelled to account with him for
all moneys received . by Timothy Guy
Phelps from the mines, and that if upon
such acountinar it appears that the note
has been fuljy paid the executrix shall
reconvey to him all of the real estate in

LONDON, Ontario, June 9.â Crazed by
love for his young wife, whom it Is- said
he had driven from his home in- Chicago.
Herbert Fulford, a prosperous Chicago
contractor, last night killed his mother
in-law, Mrs. Jennie McCord and then blew
out hi3 brains. The tragedy occurred on
the McCord farm at Ilderton; near here.
The victims were first cousins. Fulford
married Gertie McCord seven years ago,
his first wife having secured a divorce
from him: Three. weeks ago Fulford and
his wife had a dispute and she returned
to her parents. Fulford followed Satur
day.--He drove to the McCord ..farm and
demanded that Mrs. McCord, who was
milking in the yard, tell him where his
wife was. She refused and he fired four
shots from a revolver into her body, kill-
Ing - her Instantly. He then turned the
weapon upon' himself, blowing out ' his
brains.
President Charles M. Hays of the South
ern Pacific Company returned Friday
evening from Portland, Or., where he ha*
been on a tour of inspection. He was ac
cqmpanled on his trip by H. E. Fitzhugh,
who is shortly to fill the position of as
sistant , to the president. General Man
ager Julius Kruttschnitt completed the
party. "While in Portland they inspected
the new machine shops that have been
recently erected there, and Hays express
ed himself as greatly pleased with the
plant. He found . no fault with the way
that business is conducted in the north
ern division.
On the way north President Hays made
special Inspection of the rolling stock. He
found a great deal of fault, and one of
his first steps on his return was to order
some new passenger cars. Hays does not
do things by halves and an order was
sent East- for fifty coaches. Thirty of
these will be the now popular chair cars
and the rest of the order will be made
up of modern day coaches. All the cars
ordered will be sixty feet long, the big
gest ever ordered or used by the Southern
Pacific. The new cars will be used on
the overland service and will certainly be
an acquisition to the road.
On his way down President Hays stop
ped off long enough at Sacramento to pay
a visit to the railroad shops. The addi
tions to the rolling mills have been com
pleted and they will have twice the ca
pacity thaj they had in the past. A larg
er number of men will necessarily be em
ployed and work will be completed with
greater dispatch.
Grading for. the double track between
this city and Millbrae is being pushed
along with vim. Seven miles of this track
has already been completed, eighty-pound
rails being used. As soon as this work la
finished the line will be placed in the
same condition all the way to San Mateo.
When these heavy rails are laid down
faster time can be made 'with safety and
the roadbed will be much smoother to
ride over.
New oil tank cars are arriving here for

TWO EUROPEAN SPECULATORS.
ONE of the most curious results of the recent
crisis in Wall street is the revelation of the
extent to which European financiers were in
terested and involved in it. There have just occurred
the failures of two noted financiers, the one German
and the other Russian, and in each case, according to
the reports, the failure was mainly due to speculations
in American stocks and securities.
The Russian failure is that of President Altschensky
of the Khardoff Chamber of Commerce, said to be a
financier of great influence, being president. of the
Agricultural Bank and the controller of- one of the
largest iron works in the empire. His liabilities are
estimated to amount to 20,000,000 .rubles, and it is
reported his failure involves and embarrasses so many
important financial institutions that the Imperial Bank
of Russia has found it advisable 'to go to their relief
to prevent further failures.
Sfill more remarkable is the case of Commercial
Councilor Sanden of Berlin, who is described as hav
ing had financial charge of the private fortunes of the
imperial family, and whose downfall' is attributed to
his having been caught in the Northern Pacific corner.
The reports say he lost something like $8,750,000 be
longing to members of the court. The Emperor is re
ported to have.lost over $3,000,000 of his private for
tune by the failure arid the Duke of Schleswig-Hol"
stein is said to have been completely ruined. In tlje
same report it is added: ' .. , - ';
"Except for the protest of! the Ministry the Em
peror would probably have turned over to Sanden the
'iron stock,' or the family-fund of the royal family,
amounting, to $25,000,000, and now invested in gilt
edge London and New York real estate." .
Of .course, the stories are doubtless exaggerations,
but the very fact that they are told in explanation "of
the collapse of financiers in Berlin and St. Petersburg
is an evidence that the. connection of the financiers of
those . countries : with -jAVall-street , speculations is so
common that.avcrashjin"* the street is not deemed 'an'

PROBLEMS OP CO-OPERATION.
RECENT reports ifrom European countries con
cerning the conditions and the prospects of co
operative societies of one kind or another show
that w-hile in the main these movements have attained
a marked degree of success, they are nevertheless
hampered by a good many difficulties of operation and
are far from furnishing a complete solution to the in
dustrial problems they were called into existence to
meet.
In Great Britain, so far as the late accounts go, the
results attained have been better than in any other
country, and the movement toward further co-opera
tion goes forward with vigor. Official statistics for
1899 show that in Great Britain, exclusive of Ireland,
there were 1632 registered co-operative societies, with
a membership of 1,720,000, a share and loan capital of
Â£27,000,000, and a reserve of nearly Â£2,000,000. The
total trade of these societies for the year was estimated
at Â£69,000,000, on which there was made a profit of
Â£7,800,000 after paying 5 per cent on a capital of nearly
Â£30,000,000. The co-operative stores employed about
20,000 "committee men," chosen by the members to
manage the business, and over 78,000 other employes,
â¢while the population directly affected by the move
ment is estimated at 6,000,000.
The "problematical" work in which British co-oper
ation is now employed is that of bringing about a
practical union of labor and capital in . the form of
business partnerships. In the reports that come to us
it is stated that there have been 102 such partnerships
formed, with a total capital of Â£2,500,000, but that while
the copartnership principle has been favored by the
Scottish Wholesale Society it is opposed by the English
Wholesale Society. The basis of the opposition on
the part of the wholesalers is not stated. The chief
weakness of co-operation in Great Britain is said to
be the reluctance of the members of the societies to
pay salaries high enough to command first rate admin
istrative ability in their management.
French co-operative societies have had a difficulty
peculiar to themselves. It appears that a considerable
proportion of the whole number of such organizations
in that country have borrowed money or obtained the
capital necessary to organization by issuing shares to
outsiders, who have been given the privilege of voting
on their stock. The practice has had the effect of con
verting a good many associations organized 'for co
operation into what are virtually- joint stock compa
nies. Moreover, the same tendency is noted in or
ganizations where there were no shares issued for
borrowed capital. It is said one shareholder after an
other drops out, the more enterprising members buy.
up the less enterprising, some die, and in one way or
another shares come into the' possession of a few men,
who perhaps retire on their incomes. The number, of
employes not owning shares increases, and as the
concern prospers in a business way it contracts as a
co-operative association, 'until -those who own the
stock develop into full-fledged' capitalists. ({
i Contrasting the work of British and of French in
Â¦ the 'way of, co-operation a recent writer on the sub
ject says the French do not aim to affiliate '' producers
, with consumers as do the British, and instead of ~pr6r

CONDITION OF TRADE.
THE weather was the principal factor in business
last week. The East enjoyed the first real warm,
sunny weather of the season, and it was imme
diately responded to by an increased demand for many
kinds of goods, the retailers reporting more improve
ment in this respect than the wholesalers, though the
latter also reported a larger trade in some lines. The
reverse was the case in the Northwest, where rains,
long needed, stimulated the demand for merchandise.
In the Southwestern wheat belt, again, dry weather
cut down the crop prospects materially, especially in
Kansas, and thereby diminished the demand for
goods. As the contrary conditions almost offset each
other, the general state of the country remained about
the same, the bank clearings showing a gain for the
week of 61 per cent, every important city except Min
neapolis exhibiting an increase over the same week
last year. The failures for the week were 163, against
184 for the same week last year.
The staples, which have been featureless for some
time, showed signs of increased life, accompanied by
more or less irregularity. The iron and steel trades
were visibly quieter, owing largely to the non-settle
ment of the labor troubles, which caused considerable
hesitation at Chicago, Cincinnati and other important
markets, all of which reported diminished inquiry for
goods. Again, owing to the labor conflict, many
manufacturers have avoided seeking any new business
after July 1, and this adds to the general dullness. The
consumption, however, is seemingly as large as be
fore, though new business is falling off, and pig iron
has declined 25 cents per ton. The inquiry for agri
cultural implement material has also fallen off, point
ing to expected hesitation in this line.
Against this poorer showing in the iron trade, how
ever, the boot and shoe manufacturers report a stimu
lated demand in their line, the shipments for the week
being 20,000 cases more than during the same week
in 1900, and 90,000 more for the season to date, sur
passing all previous records. Future orders, however,
are slow in coming in. Textile goods are also quoted
in better demand, woolens being wanted for fall and
cottons for summer delivery. The raw wool, how
ever, shows no improvement in price, while the me
dium and lower grades are still in the buyers' favor.
Railroad earnings continue to make a good show
ing, those during May being 9.6 per cent over May,
1900, and 23.2 per cent over May, 1899.
There was a somewhat better tone to the stock
market during the early part of the week, due princi
pally to the gradual clearing of the railroad combina
tion atmosphere and the expectation that there will
be further large deals later on which will result in a
revival of speculative activity.. But, as the midsummer
season is at hand, the volume of business shows no
increase, and the public will probably not re-enter
Wall street until after the dog days.
The conditions here in San Francisco and on the
coast at large show no change worthy of note. For
eign exports from this port show a decrease thus far
this year from the same time in 1900, but are still
large and require all the vessels available. Local and
interior trade is reported good by the wholesalers,
and as the general tone of farm products now coming
in is firm, there is a feeling of confidence throughout
the business communitj\ Some wholesale houses re
port a lessened demand for several lines of goods in
consequence of local strikes, but this falling off is
neither serious nor general. In the main the mer
chants consider business fully up to last year and not
a few report it the best year thus far that they have
DISPATCHES from Washington announce that
in the opinion of many of the South American
diplomatists in that city "all that Blaine did for
pan-American harmony has been spoiled by the diplo
matic snarl j that !j has resulted from j the attitude as
sumed by <Qhile, encouraged by the State Department,
in regard to the discussion of arbitration in the pro
posed Pan-American Congress to be held in the City
of Mexico." . ' â¢
Such a statement emanating from diplomatic
sources shows the irritation that has arisen over the
arbitration programme that was to have been pre
sented at the meeting. of the Pan-American Congress.
The dispute, it is evident, has now reached. a point
that endangers the success of the congress, and it is
possible the meeting may be abandoned.
â¢While the congress was to consider the commercial
relations of the varidus countries of this hemisphere
and to devise ways and means for promoting their
international trade, the chief object of those who pro
mote it has been to bring about some method of set
tling the various disputes â¢ among South American
countries and thus put an end to controversies that
threaten war. It has. been said that it was Blaine's
central idea to establish peace rather than to promote
commerce when- he called;the first Pan-American Con
gress; and the executive "board of. the congress that
has been called to meet in Mexico has sought to make
arbitration the dominant issue before the delegates."
The .board consists of the United States Secretary
of -State and the Ministers Plenipotentiary at Wash
ington' of Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Costa
Rica. In reply to an invitation to take part in the
congress Chile intimated" an unwillingness to do so
unless the programme proposed by the executive
board were so amended as to confine the principle of
arbitration over boundary disputes to future occur
rences. That meant, of course, that the long dispute
between Chile and Peru over the provinces of Tacna
and Arica should not be arbitrated; and it appears
the executive board for the sake of future good agreed
to the stipulation. Now Peru and other South Ameri
can countries protest against the exception, and the
whole movement is in danger of coming to
It will be remembered the Chileans were not repre
sented, in the Pan-American Congress , called by
Blaine. They feared then, as they fear now, that under
anyarbitration they would have to surrender the two
provinces they took from Peru and also a seaport they
took from Bolivia. "Their fears appear to be well'
founded so far as the Peruvian question is concerned,
for their claims to the disputed provinces are seem
ingly without any justification whatever.
By the treaty of Ancon, made between Chile and
Peru in 1884, it was provided that Tacna and Arica
should be held by Chile for ten years and that at the
end of that time it should be left to a vote/. of : the
people of the two provinces whetKer they should-re
main Chilean or be restored to "Peru. 7"' When? the ten
years expired Chile took no step to'^ submit" the ques
tion to a vote, but in 1898 negotiations were started
to submit the issue to the Queen Regent of Spain.
For three years the Chilean Chamber of Deputies
dallied over the matter and early in the present year
broke off the negotiations altogether. It will be seen
that her case is so bad she can hardly hope to retain
the two provinces upon any other terms than those
which wall exclude them from arbitration altogether.
The issue raises the question of how far the principle
of international arbitration can be enforced. Our
Government did not hesitate to interfere under the
Monroe doctrine to compel Great Britain* to arbitrate
her boundary dispute with Venezuela, but we are not
likely to compel Chile to arbitrate. Perhaps inter
national authority may be eventually enforced upon
the unwilling by war, but as yet the world is not
ready for. such active interference by a concert of
powers. It will be seen therefore that the Pan-Ameri
can Congress may be as futile" as was the famous
Peace Conference at The Hague. ;

A resume of boiler data in the German

Marine Rundschau. It embraces seven
types of boilers placed in forty ships, and
the data are the results obtained from
actual results at sea under forced draught,
highest speed under natural draught and
ui^3er cruising speed. These data are of
interest to marine engineers and cover a
wider range than has hitherto been exhib
ited In 'so comprehensive a form. In the
following condensed table the data, ob
tained under forced draught speed, are
briefly summarized:
THE PRIMARY. LEAGUE.
WITH the declared purpose of the newly in
corporated Republican Primary League all
good citizens will sympathize. As set forth
in the articles of incorporation, it is "to foster and
maintain the political principles of the Republican
party, to arouse and maintain the interest of all elec
tors in the maintenance and enforcement of the pri
mary election law and of all laws pertaining to elec
tions.". If to that main purpose the league remain
true and steadfast its service will be of benefit not to
Republicans only, but to all good citizens; for what
soever tends to eliminate boss control from the pri
maries of any great party must be of benefit to the
whole community.
In one sense it is unfortunate that it should be nec
essary to organize and incorporate an association for
such purposes. It would be better if all citizens could
be brought freely and of their own individual will to
the polls in every election, from the primaries to the
final vote. Experience, however, has proven that such
spontaneous action on the part of all cannot be at
tained under present conditions. The business men of
the community, absorbed in their private are
apt to neglect politics. They are especially apt to
overlook the primaries, owing to the fact that those
elections take place before the campaign opens and
the excitements of the contest attract the 'attention of
the general public. Such being the case, it is necessary
that something be done to bring the better elements
of the people to the primaries, and consequently the
Primary League promises to supply a genuine need
of the time.
Of the importance of primary elections under our
system of party government every citizen is aware.
It has been through them that the bosses and their
gangs, by the practice of fraud or bj r resort to open
violence, have obtained great influence and some
times complete control over nominating conventions.
Thus good citizens have found themselves virtually
excluded from the primaries, and sometimes on elec
tion days have been compelled to vote against their
own party ticket as the sole means of rebuking the
bosses and making it known to them that while they
could nominate a bad ticket they could not always
elect it.
A long-continued agitation for reform in the pri
maries has brought about the enactment. of the present
primary law, and its efficacy is now to be tested. It
goes without saying there is nothing in the law that
can of its own vigor purify politics. If any consider
able number of good citizens remain away from the
primaries the bosses will be able to elect a majority
of the delegates to the nominating conventions under
the law just as easily as in the old days when there
was no law. The issue then in the end depends upon
the citizens themselves. Unless they take an interest
in politics, go to the polls and vote for good men,
thus assuring honesty and fidelity in the nominating
conventions, the law will be as worthtless as if the
Supreme Court had declared it invalid.
It is to be hoped the incorporation of the Repub
lican Primary League and its immediate activities will
have the effect of awakening the interest of all
citizens in the approaching primaries. It is desirable
that working men, business men and professional men
should take as earnest a part in public affairs as do the
bosses and their gangs. Only by the exercise of such
public spirit on their part can we attain that efficiency
of municipal administration as will enable us to make
San Francisco all that it should be. The primary law
is now on the side of good men, and all will be well if
good men range themselves in active work on the side
of the law.

XVH.- J. HOWARD HALE.
From early boyhood J. Howard Hale has
been known as a hard worker. His father
died when he was a mere lad, leaving his
mother, in meager circumstances. The
small farm was not overproductive and
young Hale soon learned what it was to
shoulder grave responsibilities. He had
very limited opportunities to attend
school.. He .was a" keen observer, however,
and rapidly accumulated a store of infor
mation as he came in contact with others.
Blessed with a strong constitution and a
will power that was not easily swayed,
his own experiences" in his youthful days
were a substitute for university lectures.
These first encounters with adverse condi
tions developed a character well fitted to
conduct the great enterprise that he now
manages and "controls.
About thirty-three years ago he con
ceived the idea of transforming some' of
the abandoned New England hill farms
into berry beds and peach orchards.'- He
began in a. small way at first, testing va
rieties and studying the underlying prin
ciples of fruit growing. Having demon
strated that the neglected and forsaken
Connecticut hills on the old home farm
would produce as fine peaches ' as were
grown anywhere in the world, in company
with his brother he borrowed money and
planted his first commercial orchard In
18S0. Mr. Hale never for a moment thought
there was any doubt about linal success
of his venture; but the good old deacons,
themselves engaged In tobacco culture,
who were responsible for a $2000 loan- of
the church funds, felt so uneasy about
the money that they requested the pros
pective fruit-grower to give better secur
ity than a first mortgage on the farm or I
to pay off his debts at once. Young, Hale
did not tell them that he then had his
first good crop of peaches on his trees,
but asked them to wait two months and
he would give the desired security. In Au
gust and September $7000 worth of peaches
were sold from the farm that the neigh
bors thought, was not good security for
$2000. The deacons were paid the full
amount of their claims.
A Great New England Peach Farm.
This was young Hale's first real encour
agement from the money point of view.
For three successive years the crops had
been killed- by late spring frosts. Here
again the resolute qualities of the lad
stuck out. His early experience with the
push cart, borrowed from a neighbor and
afterward bought for $1, in which he de
livered his fruits in the local market, was
of inestimable value in buoying up the
spirits of . a boy, j whom the neighbors
called a wild dreamer." When. the little
cart was loaded, as it often was, it took
lots of push to start it; hanging back
would not budge it. an inch, but an ever
lasting push kept it moving slowly ahead.
This, young Hale discovered, was the only
way to get ahead and that lesson of push,
learned from experiences with the old
hand cart, has stimulated and carried him
over many discouraging any trying pe
riods. â¢ ' â¢ :
Since the first big crop was secured and
the mortgage lifted and other debts paid
many larger crops have been gathered.
To-day tho old Hale farm, in the family's
hands for over 250 years, is in better con
dition, more productive and of far greater
value than ever tefore. The once aban
doned hilltops covered with rocks and
overgrown^ with underbrush and birch are
now cleanly cultivated and studded with
great peach orchards, which during the
latter part of May present one grand bou
quet. The delicate Â¦ pink of tho peach
bloom on. nearly a . hundred thousand
trees planted on terraces, in contrast with
the green wooded background of higher
and rougher hills and the river and valley
fields below, have made the Hale farm
famous throughout New England, to say
nothing of the carloads of luscious fruits
produced later in the season. The little
push-cart has long since given way to
more modern means of transportation.
The Hartford street railway has run a
sidetrack into this farm and the fruit is
packed in cars, constructed for that pur
pose, and rushed by electricity to the
steam railway, nine miles distant. This
is the first fruit farm in the Uaited States
to adopt the trolley car for handling fruit
direct from-the orchard.
Growing Peaches in Georgia.
Having thus made a fair start in Con
necticut, Mr. Hale wanted to extend his
orchards. After visiting, every peach
growing section in this country, he locat
ed a tract of about 2160 acres in Central
Georgia, near Fort On this im
mense plantation he fcus developed the
largest individual orchard in the world.
Over 250,000 trees are fruiting and younger
orchards are coming on each season.
Trees are set with perfect regularity thir
teen feet apart and the orchard is laid off
into blocks 1000x500 feet each way. The
avenues are thirty feet wide and the cross
streets twenty-six feet wide. The former
â¢are named after the great.peach-produc
ing States, California, Michigan, Ohio,
Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Con
necticut, Georgia, etc., while the latter
are called Downing, Wilder, Warder,
Thomas, Barry, Gold, Bailey, etc., after
renowned horticulturists. Thus the whole
system is unique. From the main pack
ing shed stretching away for two miles Is
one great forest of peach trees. â¢
Mr. Hale has systematized every detail
of this industry. During the height of the
season in June and July over 800 persons
about equally divided between white and
black are employed and they camp on the
place. The first bell rings at 3 o'clock in
the morning, which serves as a signal to
the superintendent that the stableman is
at his post feeding the horses and mule3.
At 4 o'clock, through the gray of the
morning, the merry procession starts
through the orchard, singing. From
morning till night the plantation echoes
the refrains of the negroes, happy and
contented, hidden among the foliage. The
Jxees are headed low and all the fruit,
even on the oldest trees, can- be picked
from the ground without a ladder. The
pickers are divided into gangs of about
twenty, each with a foreman. Every
picker is numbered and furnished with a
bunch of cards bearing his number. When
he begins picking he drops a card in the
bottom of the basket. All fruit must be
picked according to a standard of ripe
ness and variety, i If a basket is too ripe,
too green or in any way deficient, it is de
tected In the packing house and the num
bered card in the bottom is given to the
field superintendent, who is constantly in
the saddle. He gallops away to find the
offender arid brings him to task.
Packing Peaches for th.3 Market.
By 5 o'clock In the morning the wagons
begin to bring the fruit into the packing
shed and there is a constant stream of
fruit pouring in all day long. The bas
kets, set upon the platform, are immedi
ately taken by the assorters, who divide
the fruit into three grades In long canvas
trays stretched upon a table before them.
On the opposite side of these long tables
hundreds of white girls and boys of the
most refined classes, including * school
teachers, musicians, artists and others,
pack the fruit in small four-quart baskets.
Six of these baskets constitute a carrier
or crate. Every peach must be up to
standard size, without blemish and in a
perfect state of ripeness before being
placgd in one of these baskets. A gen
eral foreman keeps close watch in the
packing shed and before the lid is nailed
on every crate is inspected by an expert,
who makes sure that every, piece of fruit
is what the guaranty carries with it, in
a perfect condition and the same all the
way through. If a single peach is found
containing a bruise or blemish of any
kind the entire crate is returned to the
packer and as a penalty it must be re
packed. The girls handling this fruit be
come-very expert and from eighty to 100
crates a day is considered a good pack,
although some experts pack from 175 to
200 crates. Each carrier contains from 100
to 210 peaches, depending on the grade.
Each packer handles during the day from
20.000 to -30,000 pieces of fruit in addition
to handling the baskets and carriers.
Every basket, crate and even the cars
are labeled with Mr. Hale's red label.
Last summer a Northern man who was
visiting this orchard timed two of the ex
pert packers, a man and a woman. Each
removed three baskets and the middle
partition, handled 132 peaches and set the
carrier aside for shipment In two min
utes and twelve seconds. The same day
another expert, who was packing canta
loupes handled forty-six melons and pack
ed them ready for market in twenty sec
onds. The boys who nail the lids upon
the packages also become experts. One
lad drove six nails in nine seconds, while
his competitor drove the same number
and set the package aside in ten seconds."
The fruit is parsed directly into refriger
ator cars from the shed. Less than an
hour elapses from the time the fruit is
plucked from the tree until it is in cold
storage. During the rush of the season
a car is loaded every hour through the
day. It is a rare sight to see an entire
express train carrying the products of a
single orchard. The cars are iced five
times after they leave the orchard before
they reach the Northern markets.
Music for the Fruit Packers.
During the heavier part of- the packing
Â¦season Mr. Hale noticed that many girls
left the sheds at night in a rather melan
choly mood, and decided to try a new plan
to stimulate and give them new life the
latter part of the day, when the hours
seemed longer than usual. Here he exhib
ited his ingenuity, and, much to the de
light of the packers, the following after
noon about zo'clock a band, consisting of
the star players of the neighborhood, was
placed upon the platform in the shed.
They were instructed to play any kind of
music they chose the early part of the
afternoon, but to have strains of a lively
character later, and at the close of the
day nothing but the genuine old South
ern hoe-down would suffice. When the
quitting hour arrived the band was play
ing the liveliest tunes known to the lead
er. As a consequence the girl packers
left the sheds every afternoon in a happy
and contented frame of mind, rested and
refreshed, in condition to enjoy a good
night's sleep. At the same time, much to
the surprise of Mr. Hale, he found that
while the music rested his employes and
made them much more cheerful the aver
age pack was 30 per cent greaterâ enough
to pay for music and leave a profit.
There are nearly forty â¢ miles of graded
roads in his orchard, and -one can drive
all. day long through vistas of peach
trees. The railroad was constructed in
1S95 through the heart of the estate by' the
Central Railway of Georgia. All details
of management are planned and given
out by Mr.* Hale from his Connecticut
office, he going to Georgia only during
the packing and shipping season. In ad
dition to the two packing sheds there is
a large, "well-equipped evaporator estab
lished, in which all fallen fruit and fruit
of an inferior quality, speckled or bruised,
is thoroughly prepared and dried. The
Red Label Hotel is another interesting
feature of this orchard. It is built accord-
Ing to modern plans and accommodates
about 250 employes. It i3 managed on a
co-operative basis, and the young men
and women secure their meals at actual
cost, paying nothing for room Â¦ and other
accommodations. Some of the young men
club together, recure a cook and provide
their own meals.

AMUSEMENTS.
S^pâ r^HE parishioners of St. Peter's
r II filled St. Peter's Hall last night,
II being assembled to celebrate the
H twenty-fifth anniversary â¢ of the
ordination of Rev. Peter S. Casey,
who for twenty-three years has been the
pastor of that church. A musical pro
gramme was rendered and an engrossed
set of resolutions -was presented to the
pastor.
The programme was opened by an intro- .
ductory address by Thomas B. Slevin,
chairman of the committee having the
celebration in charge. After several mu
sical numbers ' were rendered , Thomas R.
Curtis read the engrossed resolutions and
made the Â¦ presentation. Following is a
portion of the resolutions:
It 'gives "us unaffected pleasure, reverend and
dear Father Casey, to call to mind to-day the
many claims you have upon our gratitude, our
esteem and our love. No work has been too
hard for you, no trouble too great when our
Interest or our convenience has been concerned.
You have been a 'stanch friend and a wise
counselor. You have been kind and gentle
with us in our many failings and shortcom
ings. You have known how to rejoice with
us In our joys and you have known how to
sorrow with us in our sorrows. By the sick
bed your voice has added comfort to the sacra
ments of the church. In the house of mourn
ing your very presence has been a consolation.
When â¢ we look back upon the past twenty
three years and see all' that has been done in
this parish we' cannot but wonder at the en
ergy and perseverance, and foresight you have
displayed, for you are the master builder and
architect of it all. We worship In a church
as beautiful' as the Anos\ beautiful on' this
coast, and to your energy the credit is due.
That church is adorned . and furnished as be

most important of all matters, the cause of
Christian education? Our children and our
children's welfare have always been your daily
solicitude. Since you came to us you have
cherished and fostered the Sisters ot Mercy,
who have in St. Peter's Academy done such
noble work for the young of this district. Even .
though burdened with the task of building the
new church you had courage enough to under
take the foundation of a Fecond school, and it
is to you we owe the inestimable blessing of
the presence of the Christian Brothers. Your
hands never grow weary in well doing, and it
Is to you we are indebted for the most neces
sary project to complete and round out the
endowment of the parish â a project whose ac
complishment, we hope, will mark the Jubilee
year. â¢ We mean the new residence for the
parochial clergy.
To you, reverend and dear Father Casey, we
We have, therefore, reverend and dear Father
Casey, many reasons, both public and private,
to congratulate you on this auspicious an
niversary. With all. our hearts we wish you
well. Be assured your people not only honor
you as a priest, but they . esteem you as a
man and love you as a friend. To us all you
are the sosarth aroon. We pray< that the
years that are before you may be even more,
and happier, and richer in results than the
years that have gone by. There Is no honor
owe under God that we have here an ideal
parish after the mind of the fathers of the
council of Baltimore.. And it was no mean
testimonial to your personal worth and to your
administrative capacity that when the 'decrees
of that council were put in force concerning
the erection of irremovable rectorates St.
Peter's parish should have been among the
first to be so designated. . â¢
In the afternoon Father. Casey Â¦will re
ceive his friends at the parochial resi
dence. To-night the closing exercises of
St. Peter's Academy will be held.
The celebration proper will take place
this morning. Solemn high mass will be
celebrated at 10:30 o'clock by Rev. Father
Casey. Rev. Peter C. Yorke will preach
the sermon. Archbishop Riordan will be
present, and fully fifty clergymen are ex
pected to be in attendance.
Father Casey responded with much
emotion. He assured his â¢ parishioners
that their affection and co-operation had
made possible whatever results had been
accomplished, and he bespoke their con
tinued co-operation.
The musical programme included the
following numbers:
Piano solo. Miss Florence Coonan; selection,'

The Germ That Causes It Has to Be
Destroyed to Cure Dandruff.
Many a woman spends an hour twice a
week scouring her scalp, thinking sciub-
bing off the scurf will cure the dandruff.
Two hours a week, at the age of 40 years,'
she has spent 260 days of 12 hours each, or
two-thirds of\a year of her life, in that
vain hope: vain, because you can't cure
dandruff without killing the dandruff
germ, and the only hair preparation on
earth that will do that is Newbro's "Her-
picide"â also a delightful hair dressing,
and thoroughly antiseptic against all con-
tagion frpm use of others* hair brushes.
It is also a delightful hair dressing.

twirled for Los Angeles, put up good ball
tossing, and only allowed nine hits, but
the errors on the part of his field were

MANY MARKSMEN
AT SHELL MOUND
Amid the lusty cheers of encouragement
given by his fellow clubmen, and in fact
by all the cyclists who were present.
Burton Downing, the pride of the Garden
City Wheelmen, crossed the tape* yester
day morning on the San Leandro triangle
In what proved to be the fastest time ever
made in a twenty-five mile road race on
this coast. He completed the quarter of
a century ride In one hour, six minutes
and three seconds, or two minutes and
seventeen seconds faster than the pre
vious record, which was made on a course
S00 yards shorter than that which was
ridden over yesterday. The race, aside
from the remarkable time, was note
worthy because of its exceedingly excit
ing finish. In the bunch which Downing
led across the tinish there were at least
a dozen other riders, none of whom were
more than .a quarter of a second behind
the winner.
The occasion was the seventh annual
twenty-tive-mile handicap road race of
the California Associated Cyclist! The
contest, although scheduled to start at 10
o'clock, was about one hour late. The
contestants from the very start set a hot
pace, and for the first lap the scratch men
were unable to gain in the least on those
who had handicaps. In fact, with very
few exceptions the men maintained their
positions until the last lap. Then- the
scratch men and those who had strength
in reserve began their spurt.
Lea Inglis of the Olympic Club, with a
seven-minute handicap, finished first. He
was closely pressed by O. F. Lind, who
also had a seven-minute handicap, and by
C. Clifton with a five-minute handicap.
Scarcely had they crossed the line, how
ever, when the main bunch loomed up in
the distance. As they neared the tape
their wheels were so closely locked to
gether and they were traveling at such a
terrific pace that the judges could . not
distinguish the numbers of all the con
testants, and therefore some whose names
should appear among the Â¦winners were
lost.
While rounding the turn on the Hay
wards road Lace Downing was. thrown
from his wheel and withdrew.
The following are the winners and their
net time:

Annual Twenty - Five - Mile
Race Results in a
Close Finish.
a;, r. Curtis' young greyhound Rector
won first prize in the Class , Reserve stake
at Union Park yesterday, beating W. C.
Glasson's Dewdrop in, the course for final
honors.'.
To' see Rector's colors raised at the fin
ish of the stake was not what the ones
who keep posted had anticipated, not that
they figured him lacking in speed or clev
erness or that he was not. the eaual of
his opponents in a trial, but simply be
cause they thought him incapable of go
ing the whole distance of seven courses.
As the final pair was slipped Glasson's
[dog took the lead and.it looked a cer
j tainty that second place was awaiting
Rector as a* claimant. It was in the work,
however, that Rector showed to advan
tage, for when the kill was scored the
determined courser .was even sticks with
Dewdrop. In the run-off Rector's back
ers were not so hopeful and withheld the
odds they had offered. The dog proved
better than was expected and finished the
stake infirst place, score 6 to 2.
Dewdrop ran well throughout the stake
and won his courses without a point be
ing scored against him until the Â¦ semi
final. In that trial against Young Game
Boy luck was with him and the favor of
the hare had much to' do with hoisting
the flag in his color. America and Ever
Sure performed well and reached good po
sitions. War Eagle, j the stake . favorite,
was put out by the ! ultimate winner in
the fifth round after a close go.
-Favorites held their own, nine upsets
being recorded in this event. 'Anchor beat
Bona Fide, Motto beat St. Ives, John Doe
beat The Grafter, at 2 to 1; Real Article
beat Narcissus, Ever Sure beat Brutus,
Rector beat War Eagle, at 5 to 3; Chicago
Boy beat â¢ Lawrence, i Agamemnon beat
Mayflower and Echo beat Vulcan, at 5
to 4. . Â¦ Â¦ â
In the Puppy Stake E. M. Kellogg's
Modest Lad Won first money, beating P.
M. Curtis' Miss Pye in the deciding
course, 5 to 4.
' Royal Tick looked to have a chance for
the stake, but was a victim of coursing
luck -in going against a trained hare.
Charley Griswold had boxed up Old Ga
zabo, the pest that* gave the dogs such
severe work last season, and it fell to
the lot of Royal Tick to chase him. After
playing with the pair of youngsters for a
while, the educated jack distanced them
to the escape.
Four short ends landing showed that
the talent was not good in picking win
ners in this stake. Sir Pitt beat Royal
Archer at 2 to 1 and was beaten by Mod
est Lad at the same price. 'Miss Pye beat
Royal Dick at 5 to 2 and lost the final
with Modest Lad, when the odds were 5
to 4 on her chances.

THE Police Commissioners have de
cided to place Captain James W.
Gillin on the retired list. For about
five years Captain Gillin, who is
one of the most popular members
of the Police Department, has been in
charge of the Miss'on district. Some time
ago he became incapacitated from duty,
due to a severe injury to the kneecap re
ceived while raiding a Chinese gambling
joint. At first he paid little attention to
the injury, but as it grew worse he con
sulted a specialist, who advised him to
submit to an operation. Since the opera
tion the unfortunate officer has been con
fined to his bed, practically unable to
move. Several months ago his relatives
had him removed to St. Mary's Hospital,
where another operation was performed,
but without benefiting the invalid. To
complicate matters rheumatism set in,
adding to his suffering.
From the hospital Captain Gillin was
taken to some hot springs in the northern
part of the State, as it was thought that
the change might do. him some good.
Since then his condition, if -anything, has
become worse.
Realizing that Captain Gillin will never
again be able to do police duty, the Com
missioners have decided to retire him on
a pension at the July meeting of the
PRESIDENT OF THE JUNIOR
COUNCIL OF YOUNG MEN'S
INSTITUTE.

The amount of subscription or donation Is
optional with the Individual, who is expected
to gauge contributions by the degree of his or
her sympathy for the victims of the most
dreaded of all incurable diseases.
The Jews of the Pacific Coast are expected
to do their share, and in placing the matter
before them we feel assured that a plain state
ment of facts will be sufficient to stir the
generous Impulses, without attempting to draw
any vivid pictures of the ravages of this dire
disease or describing the agonies of its much
to be commiserated victims, whose only solace
has heretofore been the comforting embrace of
the silent grave. Now we may, If the disease
be taken in time, check Its progress and arrest
Its development by contributing a fair amount,
either as a donation or. membership -fee, as
can come to the rescue " of Â» hundreds of suf
ferers â fathers, mothers and fondly loved
Â¦-â¢hildren â whese lives may be ! prolonged and
whose families may not only be made happy
but nerhaps spared the degradation of taking
alras.
When the new structure is completed it will
require at least . $60,000 per annum to operate
the Institution, and as the burden Is to be so
widely spread, there can be no room to doubt
that the money wlll.be forthcoming.
It is now proposed to enlarge . the hospital
by erecting another ward near the main build
ing, to which â¢ it will be connected by a cov
ered way. Funds are urgently needed both for
the building and for the proper maintenance of
the Increased number of Inmates. At' present
$26,000 is expended annually to support the | In
stitution. That is at the rate, of $1 18 per day
per patient. This includes the cost of medical
attendance, too, and as all the patients are
indigent and cannot pay anything, this small
sum provides for all their needs.
The hospital Is now a national - institution,
deriving its support from the entire Jewish
community of the United States. There la,
however, at present accommodations for only
sixty-three patients, and as the waiting list
has always been a Ions one, the hospital has
always had to take care of that, number.

Drillers have begun to Investigate
'-he subject of foundations for the mil
lion-dollar hotel to be erected by the
â¢rocker heirs on the northwest corner of
Powell and Geary streets. This was so
near the begirring of the actual con
struction of that splend'd structure that
many spectators gathered around the
derrick and the few men at work and
manifested lively interest. Fifteen year*
l^ave changed the surroundings of Union
square so much for the better that it i*
hardly like the former locality. Two
â¢ hurebee, both large and held by wealthy
Â°"Sregations, have now given way In
hat section to the demands of business
a its westward march. The old property
Â¦ f the Red Mei, fronting: en the square,
will be adorned with a fine building in
;he not distant future. The city is going
ahead so fast now in the matter of solid
end costly structures that no past period
in the history of its advancement has
been comparable .to the present. The
signs are everywhere observable that the
immediate future is equally bright. The
f=ale of the Blythe property and the plans
for the Mutual Bank and the new Flood
buildings imply j-plendid progres for Mar
ket street. Two sales announced this
week were coupled with the information
1 that warehouses w^re to be built on each
of two properties in the manufacturing
an<j warehousing section of the city.

NOW OPERATING
Nearly- as Big as Jliyer
; Steamer and Very
Costly. ;
Prospects Favorable ; for a
Good Season ; Upon
; ; Mother Lode.
The largest gold dredger -In the United
States has Just . begun to operate in the
Oroville dredging â¢ field. .It is so remark-,
able in several' ways that, although allu
sion has been made to, it before, it will
justify some further statement of facts ,
concerning it. Â¦, ;Â¦ '
The.hullJs eighty-six feet long, thirty
feet wide and seven feet deep and it
weighs, without-any 'machinery, 1 approxi
mately 135 tons. Â¦ The machinery weighs i
about 130 tons additional. It is the prop
erty of the Boston and ' Oroville Gold
Dredging Company. It is working .west
of the river, in South Thermalito, about
two and one-Half miles west from, Oroville.
The apparatus will work at a depth . of
thirty-five -feet below the surface and at
tacks tailings to the height of thirty feet
above the surface.: Electricity is the mo
tive _power, from the Butte County electric
power-house on Butte Creek. The cost of
handling the material is estimated to be
about four cents per cubic yard or even
less. Sight men are employed as the crew.
Four other dredges are to be built for the
Bame company by .the Risdon Iron Works
of this city. ;
New Smelter Working. .
The first copper blocks have been turned
out by the new smelter- at De Lamar, in
Shasta County. A road has been graded
so that bullion can be loaded for hauling.
The works are running smoothly, accord-
Ing to the local accounts. Â¦â Â¦ Â¦ .
The Redding, Free - Press renews the
rumor that the Mountain Copper Com
pany will get the Balaklala mining prop
erty. The Balaklala management recently
purchased a group of thirty-two claims
located in the Flat Creek district, which
have been held for many . years by the
Murrays, Ellis and Willett. C. A. ..Malm
is at the head of the Balaklala Company.
â¢ The smelting works at the Needles may
be. sold. â¢ Negotiations are pending. The
Philadelphia and Arizona ; Mining Com
pany has been negotiating for the prop
erty. I Several mining claims are owned by
this Eastern concern. If the deal for the
purchase of the- smelter goes 'through
thero is a fair chance that mining in that
'district may be revolutionized. The aim
will be to secure all the fluxing ores from
the Chloride district. A proposition is also
made to put on . freight wagons between
Chioride and Kingman, a distance of
twenty miles. This is expected to reduce
the cost of transportation, which is $3 10
per . ton by rail. The Waliapai Mining
Company is back of the proposition for
the new freight route. The company owns
the Tennessee mine and other large prop
erties. The management of that com
pany is reported to have entered into a
contract with the owners of the freighting
teams in that district, the letter agreeing
to haul ore at a stipulated price for one
year Other companies have signified that
they will follow this lead.
The stockholders of the St. John Quick
silver Mining Company have elected P. B.
Lynch president and treasurer, D. J.
Vogelmann vice president, A. A. Tregidgo
general manager and J. A.' Harvey secre
tary and attorney. These officers, with
James Cline, compose the board of direc
tors. The annual report 'of the manage
ment to the stockholders shows that in the
past two years $12,500 has been expended
in the work of cleaning and retimbering
the tunnel, which had. caved in during the
twe/ity-one years that it has been in dis
use. .
On the Mother Lode;
The past week, so says the Stockton
Independent, has been a busy time on the
mother lode. Large quantities of ore are
coming up to the surface and the stamps
are dropping by the hundreds all along
the lode. Another rain storm has filled
the reservoirs to overflowing while some
additional snow has fallen In the high
Sierras. This has been one of .the most
favorable mining .seasons of several
years. The rain and the snow fell at
intervals and the" reservoirs were kept
full all the time and very little of the
water has gone to waste, much less than
in former years, when the storms oc
curred less favorably.
At the Oneida mine, in Amador County,
there are constantly dropping sixty
stamps, each weighing 1200 pounds. They i
are propelled by a 150 horse-power elec
tric motor. About 300 tons of ore crushed
in* the mill is the daily record. The mill
is one of the largest and most perfect in
the State.
The Pacific, Indiana and Phoenix min
ing properties at Plymouth have passed
into the possession "of Alvinza Hay ward
by virtue of a judgment obtained eigh
teen months ago; so says the Amador
Ledger. . â¢
| The International Mining Congress is
about to, meet. : The dates for. the session
are July 23, 24 and 25. The place is Boise
City, Idaho. The miners from. the south
ern portion of California have arranged
for an exhibit of minerals produced in
this" State to be carried to Boise. Three
large cases of samples are packed -for
forwarding when the time comes. Twen
ty-five persons from Los Angeles are ex
pected to attend the deliberations of the
Â¦ congress. . The programme of â¢"â¢ exercises
closely. , resembles those' of , preceding
events of the same general nature, in
cluding the discussion of many prac
tical subjects touching upon and directly
related to the mining industry..
Officers Are Elected.
The Nevinsville Mining Company has
elected the following officers: â¢ James T.
Hallett, president; Â¦ G. JP. Rixford, secre
tary; A. Van der Naillen general
manager; A. L. Shelf ord, superintendent.
The last named officer recently went
from this city to the mine owned by the
company at West Branch Butte, in Ore
gon, to begin operations there. Â¦
The Golden Key Mining Company re
ports the election of the following offi
cers: F. A. Wallin, president; P. West
water, vice president; Charles Cowherd,
secretary and 'treasurer; A. W. McQueen,
A. E. Shaw, C. R/ Dalton and L. M.
Sherwood, directors. The property of the
company Is in Tuolumne County,' south
from Chinese Camp. .
The Siskiyou Hydraulic Mining Com
pany is about" ready to start to work sev
eral claims.: "The Scott Valley Advance
says that when the Wild Cat property is
fitted up: the company will .have one of
the largest hydraulic outfits of any com
pany in the northern part of the State.
A sawmill is -turning out lumber as fast
as possible, and supplies are coming in
from other sources. The lack, of lumber
for the flumes .has retarded the com
pany's operations.
There has been a deal I of some size in
the Yreka Mining and Milling Company
at -Salmon 'River. Judge O'Neill has sold
out a one-twelfth interest in the property
for $10,000, according to ; the Yreka Jour
nal. A company is -arranging to place a
dredger upon Â¦ McAdams" Creek . to handle
the bedrock gravel rof, the; stceam. - v
Operations in Nevada.
The Carson Appeal says that any one
who supposes- that Nevada Is played out
as a. mining field would do well to look
around,- for in all sections there J are evi
dences i of mining . activity, add . nearly,
every county in the State. is having pros
perous times in \ mining. Says -, the Ap

Morrison ' Fellows, who hasbeen working In
and around the smelting works and mines near
Yerington," returned ' to ' Carson '. Sunday. He
says that- the . company* operating, ig working
"everything on a'.big. scale, i It takes 160 tons of
ore to run the works twenty-four hours and the
way they are turning out metal Is a . wonder.
The matte Is not , refined at Â¦ the . works, but j is
'sent below. ~ The copper, as incomes; from the
furnace Is worth $400 per ; ton.; It looks , more
like iron than copper, vbut evidently carries the
value, I as I the company | operating : is . satisfied
with the results.- One â¢' hundred . and twenty
five men are employed at the mine and smelter.
The; work at r the mines , is thorough. ' ; ;

As soon as the- arrest had been made
Captain, Seymour* telegraphed East to
to New York police, and yesterday he
received a letter saying that some one
would start West at once with the neces
sary papers to secure an extradition. It
is understood that Vernon will make a
hard fight against taken back to
New York. â¢ . .
i As soon as Captain Seymour received the
warrant .for the arrest, of Vernon,' or
Geirshofer, he sent Detective Hamill
over to San Rafael to notify the Sheriff,
of Marin County and arrest the man,
who was known to have a residence in
Mill Valley. For "some time the police
have known that -Vernon and Geirshofer
were the same man, but It was not known
that Vernon was j the head of any com
pany in this city, jj He was found and ar
rested Â¦ without trouble. '- . . Â¦-
Mr. Auerbach says that, in his opinion,
between $10,000 and $20,000 had been placed
in Geirshofer's hands for investment.
He declined to mention the names of his
friends who also had placed confidence
in Geirshofer, arid: said that he did not
know whether they Intended to bring
action against him. â¢
Amount of the Steal.
. By nrearrangement we were to meet
on January 1 and settle all outstanding
accounts. About Christmas Gelrshofer
wrote me that his wife was ill, and that
he had obtained a vacation of a week
In order. to take her. south. At the end
of that time he did not return, and our
suspicions were aroused. I' went to the
office of Hallgarten & Co., 'and asked one
of the members of the firm whether per
mission had been granted, for Gelrshofer
to make use of confidential, information.
It was told that no such permission had
been given, and it' was then that .we
placed the matter in the hands of the
police." . â¢ . â â¢Â¦ .
"We' gave him money from time to
time, and he told us that he had invest
ed it. When a dividend was declared by
any of the corporations in which he had
invested Geirshofer would pay' each one
of us his share of the profits, and in
case any stock was sold we received the
money that "was our due. We never
questioned Geirshofer closely. â¢
"This story seemed plausible and sev
eral of my friends joined me in trusting
Geirshofer. "We had known him . in a
business way for many years and had no
reason to suspect him of being dishonest.
Trusting Friends Taken In.
"Geirshofer told me." said Mr. Auer
bach," "that he had little money him
self and had therefore come to me. This
was his proposition: I or my frlend3
should advance money and he would in
vest it in such a way that it would always
be on the side of pools engineered by
Hallgarten & Co. or J. P. Morgan & Co.,
for he also averred that he had inside in
formation in regard to the Morgan syn
dicate." ; Â¦ â¢,
According to the story told by Mr. Auer
bach before the Grand Jury, Geirshofer
had defrauded several brokers and spec
ulators. He said' Geirshofer came to him
about a year ago and told him thatif
he had money to invest and would place
confidence in a "confidential clerk" he
would ,be assured a princely income.
Geirshcfer had told him, Mr. Auerbach
said, that Hallgarten & Co. manipulated
several uools each year and that, he had
been granted permission to utilize for his
individual gain the information that nec
essarily came into his possession.
Captain Titus ordered Detective Ser
geants Clark and Fay of the central of
fice to locate Geirshofer. After a search
of two months they .learned on Saturday
that he was living, in San Rafael, Cal.,
where hs, was known as Howard E. Ver
non. Captain Titus immediately tele
graphed to the San Francisco police to
arrest the man and hold him for extradi
tion. It was said to-night at police head
quarters that a marshal would be sent to
San Francisco to-morrow.

NEW TORK, June 9.â Edgar Geirshofer,
alias Howard E. Vernon, who was ar
rested in Escalles, Cal., yesterday by
Sheriff Taylor of Marin County and De
tective Archie' Hamill of. San Francisco,
was for many years confidential clerk of
the brokerage firm of Hallgarten & Co.
of Exchange place and Broad street.' He
was arrested on the complaint of Robert
Auerbach, a brower of 58 Wall street, who
asserts that Geirshofer by false pretences
obtained from $10,000 to $20,000 from sev
eral men who !had placed trust In him
and that he had then attempted to flee
from the country. The, arrest was made
at the request of Captain Titus of the de-,
tective bureau. Mr. "Auerbach made the
complaint against Geirshofer early In
April. He was indicted by the Grand
Jury and a bench warrant from the clerk
of the Court of General Sessions was is
sued on April 3, 1901. Secrecy was main
tained that "Geirshofer mipht not learn
that legal steps had been taken to obtain

BEADY TO HOLD
YEARLY SESSION
Why do we refer to those times, crimsoned
with the best blood of our race? We do bo to
demonstrate once more. If necessary, that the
ooldier spirit of the Celt is yet as virile and
as fearless as it was three thousand years ago,
and that it was this same noble spirit which
fired the eoul of the gallant exile, John Mc-
Bride, to take the sword and oh the South
African veldt, with the splendid -chivalry of
his race, fling himself into the fight for liberty,
and by his valorous achievements before an
admiring world prove once again that the chil
dren of the Gael are still a force to be counted
In the, world's economy.
, This is why the Irish people should give tes
timony of their admiration to this splendid
Irishman. And it is In order to afford our
people such an opportunity that the Knights
of the Red Branch invited Major McBride to
San Francisco.
Knowing that the Irish people love valor and
virtue and are ever ready to honor those su
blime qualities In all men, but particularly
when the possession of them by men of our
race Is exhibited In so conspicuous a manner
as in the case of Major McBride, : we confi
dently appeal to you to assist by co-operating
with us in our efforts to make the reception
to this heroic exiled soldier one worthy of the
cause and of tbe man.
Father Yorke will take part in the re
ception to Major McBride, which will also
be in the nature of a celebration of the-
Wolfe Tone anniversary.
A communication has been addressed to
all Irish societies in the city by the recep
tion committee. It states that June 22 was
chosen as the date of Major McBride'a
lecture because it is the anniversary of
the birth of Theodore Wolfe Tone. After
dwelling upon the heroic and bloody
struggle of the Irish people in times gone
by to throw off the oppressor's yoke, the
circular says:
Irish Nationalists met at 1133 Mission
street yesterday to arrange for Major Mc-
Bride's reception. There was a lusty spirit
of independence in the proceedings and
many a cheer for the struggling Boers. It
was decided to send a committee to Port
Costa to meet the gallant major, and that
there might be no hitch in the proceedings
a committee consisting of Jeremiah Deasy,
chairman; Colonel J. C. O'Connor, Cap
tain Peter Dunne, James J. Cunnife, Wil
liam J. Hudson, Frank J. Kierce and T. J.
Mellott, was appointed to arrange the de
tails. The Knights of the Red Branch
Rifles will escort Major McBride to the
Occidental Hotel, where he . will remain
during his stay.
It may perhaps have been the irony of
fate that made Major John McBride, who
espoused the Boer cause at Johannesburg
September 9, 1899, the captor of his fellow
countrymen, the Dublin Pusileers, who
fought under the English flag. Major Mc-
Bride is to be treated as a hero whÂ«n he
arrives in this city to-morrow afternoon.
Every Irish society in the city will assist
in giving him a hearty welcome.
Irish Nationalists Make
Preparations for
Reception.
HONOR TO HERO
OF BOER CAUSE
The father of Hugh Tevis bequeathed
all his property to his. wife, but it is said
that she in turn settled upon each of the
children $2,000,000.
There were many callers at the Tevis
home yesterday, but only the most inti
mate friends were admitted. Messages of
condolence were received by the hun
dreds, and manv comforting words were
cabled to the young widow, whose honey
moon has been ended so tragically.
Gossip is busy with the financial affairs
of the dead capitalist and the amount
of the estate which will be divided be
tween the heirs. It is said that after his
marriage to Miss Cornelia Baxter Hugh
Tevis made a will. It is surmised by his
friends that he has bequeathed his for
tune about equally to his widow and his
daughter by his first wife.
Little Alice Tevis. the eight-year-old
daughter of the deceased, is with' her ma
ternal grandmother at the Boalt place at
Cloverdale. Little Alice, who was pas
sionately devoted to her father, has not
yet been told the sad news.
Grief broods over the' mansion on Tay
lor street, where the members of the
Tevis family have gathered. . . At first
grave fears were entertained for Mrs.
Lloyd Tevis, whose health for some time
has been in a most precarious condition,
but she is surprising her family and lov
ing friends and bearing up nobly and
bravely.
The. Tevis family no longer expect any
tidings from the widow. They feel that
the relict of Hup.i Tevis is prostrated in
her grief and unable to cable any of the
sad particulars.
No word has come from Japan to tell
how poor Hugh Tevis met his untimely
end. Since the cable brought the brief
news of death," no news has been received
from the young and beautiful widow,
who, all alone In Yokohama, must be at
tending to all the many necessary- details
that will permit of her bringing the. rer
mains home.
