When the applause, in which the beat

a.! follows:
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the
Ohio Society: It gives me very great pleasure
to meet with the former citizens of Ohio, now
residents of the State of California. The next
best thing to being a citizen of Ohio le to be
a citizen of some other State (laughter) and I
am sure those of you who have selected this
(.â¢olden State as a place of residence can have
no cauw for regret. We are In the habit
of saying in our State that "Once a Buckeye,
always a Buckeye," and that no matter where
we eo or where we reside, we still have in
our heart* that warm love and devotion for
the old State and Its cherished memories.
I meet Ohio people wherever I go and the
fiurprise to me in how we have gotten on so
well when so many of you have left us.
(Laughter and applause.) And tUen I have
that other reflection, how would the other
fetatea have gotten on it we hadn't loaned you
to them (laughter), for In every State the Ohio
man has taken an honorable place, whether
in business or politics, and has carried the
htm tr ?? itl ? n ? of the old commonwealth' with
A Glorious Old State.
It Is a glorious old State. Glorious names ar*>

and then we never forget that Grant was born
in Ohio (applause), he who girdled the globe
with his fame as he marched in the pathway
Â¦ of the eun. Nor that Sherman, he who made
that magnificent march from Atlanta, to the
sea, wan born in Ohio. (Applause.) And that
that gallant little Irishman, Phil Sheridan
(applause), who didn't permit Jubal Early to
rest in the summer of 1SC4 in the Shenandoah

GRAPE LEAP BEETLE
IN SONOMA COXTNTY
Pest Makes Its Appearance There
and Alarms the Owners
of Vineyards.
The grape leaf beetle, an Insect pest
that has wrought havoc in vineyards
throughout this State, has made its first
appearance in Sonoma County. For a
number of years past it has claimed the
attention of vineyardlsts in other portions
of the State, and it seems to change the
location of its operations. After settling
in a section it breeds rapidly and before
the end of the season destroys much of
the budding fruit and leaves.
A report on the pest made by Alexander
Craw, Quarantine Officer and Entomolo
gist of the California State Board of Hor
ticulture, is as follows:
I received specimens of this destructive beetle
in May last from Horticultural Commissioner
William II. Robinson of Stockton; also grape
leaves allowing the result of their work, an il
lustration of which Is herewith appended. I
afterward received specimens from other
grapu-erowlns districts, which prove It to be
widely distributed.
They are nearly one-quarter of an â¢ Inch In
length; some specimens are clack, others red
dish brown. The base of the antennae and the
tibiae are reddish. Â«. They attack the leaf, cut
tlnff Ions, narrow silts, and where very num

Visits the Hospital.
At the close of the President's speech
three cheers were given by the soldiers as
the commander in chief was escorted from
the parade ground to tne general hospital.
General. Shafter introduced Colonel A. C.
Girard, assistant surgeon general ' in
charge of the hospital, who conducted the
President through the various wards. The
nurses and doctors were complimented by
the President on the neat appearance of
the buildings, -and he had many kind
words for the Invalid soldiers who saluted
him. There were many occupants of the
wards who were unable to respond to the
order "attention." and the President's
lips were noticed to quiver and his eyes
were moist as he saw tne helpless condi
tion of the poor brave fellows.
In ward J the President was attracted
by the youthful appearance of Private
Clarence Leggett of the Forty-sixth Reg
iment. Leggett is but a lad of 20 years and
fever has wasted his form to a shodow.
"How old is he?" asked the President of
the white-gowned nurse, and on learning
Leg-gett's age the chief executive said:
"He is very young for a soldier," and
smiled kindly on the fever stricken lad.
The President visited the kitchens, din
ing-rooms and ofilces of the hospital, and
on leaving the building complimented
Colonel Girard on the perfect condition of
the institution.

PRESIDENT McKINLET*S visit
to the Presidio yesterday will
live long In the memory of the
gallant soldiers who were greet
ed by the commander in chief of
the army. The men of the For-
ty-fifth and Forty-sixth Volun
teer regiments, 3000 strong, recently re
turned from the Philippines, listened to
stirring words from the head of the na
tion, while the wan and wasted faces of
the sick soldiers in the General Hospital
brightened as the President passed
through the wards and gave a kindly
word to the men who lost their health in
far away jungles while fighting for the
stars and stripes.
Thousands of citizens flocked to the Pre
sidio yesterday morning to witness the
ceremonies of the day. The big parade
ground, facing the General Hospital, was
the spot where the volunteer soldiers
gathered to listen to the words of greet
ing from the President. The space was
kept clear by the Eighteenth Infantry
end dÂ» difficulty .was experienced in hand
ling the crowds of sightseers.
Shortly after 10 a. m. the twenty-four
companies of the Forty-fifth and Forty
sixth Volunteer regiments marched from
their camss to the parade ground. At
about the same time troops H and I of
the Fifteenth Cavalry galloped from the
Presidio by the L<ombard-street gate and
drew up a few blocks away from the res
ervation, prepared to receive the Presi
dent and escort him to the parade ground.
The escort was commanded by Major
Craig, Captain Andrews and Lieutenant
Boyd.
A batterv of the Fifth Artillery took
up a position on the hill near the Lom
bard-Street gate, ready to thunder a sa
lute when the President should arrive and
another on his departure from the Pre
eidio. Captains Califf , James and Lieu
tenant England were in command of the
saluting batten'.
Colonel J. B. Rawles, commandant of
the reservation, was in charge of the ar-
rangements of the day and with his staff
saw that every detail of the reception was
attended to.
Major General Shafter. accompanied by
his aids. Captains Wilson and Plummer,
arrived at the Presidio shortly before 11
a. m. and was received with military hon
ors.
The President Arrives.
For half an hour the two regiments of
volunteers stood at rest, awaiting the ar
rival of the President. Suddenly the
thunder of the suns told of the approach
of the commander in chief and a tumult
of applause greeted him as his carriage
and escort swept past the thousands of
sightseers. The band of the Third Artil
lery struck up "Hail to the Chief" as the
President's carriage drew up at the re
viewing platform.
The President was escorted to the plat
form by General Shatter, Irvlngf M. Scott.
Colonel Rawles, M. H. de Young and Sec
retary Cortelyou. As he walked along the
President rlanced with pride at the 2000
stalwart men who stood rigidly at atten
tion. The soldiers wore blue coats and
trousers, brown leggins and brown slouch
hats and carried no arms.
General Shatter advanced to the front
of the platform and, with cap In hand,
said:
"Officers and men of the Forty-fifth and
Forty-sixth regiments, I have the honor
of Introducing to you the commander In
chief of the army."
As the President advanced to the front
of the platform the buglers sounded the
salute and the cheers of the soldiers rent
the air In mighty volume. The President
raised bis hand in salute, and when the
cheering subsided addressed the men in
terms of glowing praise. He eaid:

UNION LEAGUE GREETS PRESIDENT,
Continued from Page" Two.
Continued From First Page.
' Â¦ a few moments yesterday
| afternoon the President ap-
B peared in Union square to at-
U tend the ceremonies of breaking
e ground for the monument to be
-*L erected in honor of the navy and
the men it hasjrtven to fame.
The monument is that which has been
provided by a committee of citizens who
had in view the commemoration of the
battle of Manila Bay. The necessary
money was raised in this city, and of the
designs submitted that of Robert Aitkin,
a tall shaft with appropriate emblems,
was accepted.
The President came down town to at
tend a reception in Native Sons* Hall, but
before entering he was driven to Union
square, where everything was in readi
ness. Within a few minutes he had been
addressed by the Mayor and had replied,
a bronze spade had been handed to him
and he had turned over the sod that had
been cut from the grass. Then Reuben
H. Lloyd ran the flag to the top of the
staff, the President shook the hands of De
Rome, who had cast the spade, and of
Aitkin, who hiid designed the monument
to be erected, and in another minute,
amid the cheers of the crowd, he had en
tered his carnage and was whirled away.
The center plat In Union square had
been roped off in readiness for the cere
mony, and before the President arrived
it was surrouniied by a big crowd of peo
ple. The President left his carriage at
the curb on Post street and walked
Through the crowd to the green under the ;
flagstaff, and there he was met by Mayor
Phelan. who lest no time in addressing
him. The Mayor said:
Mr. President: On behalf of the committee
having the matter in charge. I have the honor
of inviting you to break the ground in this
Union square for the monument to be erected
to the American navy In commemoration at
Admiral Dewey's victory at Manila Bay.
Prior to the memorable May 1, 189S, the peo
ple living in this city, knowing the presence of
a Spanish fleet In the Pacific feared that our
California coast might be ravaged, and they
patriotically and gratefully regarded the
splendid victory of Admiral Dewey at Manila
Bay. and decided by public subscription to
erect this monument in honor of the event.
I will ask Mr. Reuben H. Lloyd, on behalf
of the Park Commissioners of San Francisco,
having Jurisdiction over this ground, to raise
the flag and receive the tender of the monu
ment, while you. Mr. President, will perform
the first act looking to its construction upon
this spot.
Mayor Phelaa also read the following
letter written io him by Admiral Dewey:
WASHINGTON, May 14. 1901.
Dear Sir: I have received from your office
an invitation to be present at the ground
breaking for the monument which It Is pro
posed to build at San Francisco to commemo
rate the victory of the American navy at the
battle of Manila Bay. It has given me the
greatest pleasure, as one of the 1900 persons in
the naval service who participated in that bat
tle, to learn of this recognition to be shown
them; and I earnestly hope that it may be
found practicable, as intimated In the invita
tion, to have the additional honor of the
President's assistance at the ceremonies in
connection with the breaking of ground for the
monument. Very truly yours.
GEORGE DEWET.
The President replied as follows:
It affords me great pleasure as well as honor
to break the ground in San Francisco that is
to commemorate the great victory of Manila
Bay in honor of Admiral Dewey, his brother
officers and the men behind the guns, whose
achievements made history and added new
fame to the American . aavy. 4
Mayor Phelan then' presented the little
bronze spade and the President turned
with it the sod of earth and grass that
had been loosened for him. At once
Mayor Phelan proposed three cheers for
the President; which were given with a
will, and the fag was raised. Louis de
Rome, who cast the spade and also did
the casting of the Donahue fountain,
which the President admired greatly, and
also Robert Aitkin, the designer of the
monument, were presented to the Presi
dent, and for each he had a pleasant
word. That ended the ceremonies.
In presenting the spade to the President
Mayor Phelan told how it had been cast
during the preceding two hours by Mr.
de Rome and from the metal of the
whistle of the Spanish warship Don Juan
de Austria, one of the vessels sunk in
Manila Bay during Dewey's famous fight.
It bears this Inscription:
This bronze spade was cast by Louis de
Rome from the steam whistle of .the Spanish
warship Don Juan de Austria and was used by
President William McKinley In breaking the
ground in Union square. San Francisco. May
26, 1901, for the monument to the American
navy In commemoration of Admiral Dewey's
victory at Manila Bay.
The gpade was given to the President.
GREETS THE PIONEERS AID I1TNES
eluded California, in passing through which,
Mr. President, you found its mountains stored
with treasures and its valleys lavish with
fruits, a delight and a marvel, unequaled else
where on the face of the globe. â¢
We have with us here a portion of the pio
neers of 1S49. In that year 75,000 or more ad
venturous youths came to the Golden West,
and among their first acts was the organization
of a State and the attempt to secure admission
to the Union. .....
And we have with us Native Sons and
Daughtersâ California's noblest products. The
accomplishments and graces of the daughters
and the character and ability" of the sons at
test the character of the pioneer mothers and
pioneer fathers. ,
This' assemblage of Veterans, Pioneers and
Native Sons and Daughters â¢ la delighted that
you have honored us to-day with your pres
ence. We are proud to have with us the chief
executive of this republic, flne who possesses,
aside from his high office, the confidence and
esteem of the entire nation. On behalf of these
organizations I extend to you a cordial wel
come.
Speaks for Native Daughters.
Judge Cotton then introduced Mrs. Gen
evieve Baker, gTand vieÂ© president of the
Native Daughters, who in a graceful
ppeech presented to the President the al
bum of twelve- paintings of California
scenery which is the offering of the Na
tive Daughters of the Golden West to the
President. .
Coombs Is Eloquent.
Grand Welcome to McKinley.
Congressman Frank L. Coombs was in
troduced to present a souvenir on behalf
of the Native Sons, the Pioneers and the
Mexican War Veterans. He spoke with
eloquence, which aroused much enthusi
asm. His speech was as follows:
The year 1S46 was fraught with great events.
In that year was begun the war in which the
valor of American soldiers won and dedi
cated to freedom that vast territory of which
California was a part. In that year also the
Stars and Stripes, emblems of liberty, waa
first raised above a California stronghold and
that movement begun which saved the empire
on the Pacific for a State of the American
Union.
It is In behalf of the Mexican war veterans,
the California -pioneers and their descendants,
the Native Sons of the Golden West, that I
have the honor to present to you, Mr. Presi
dent, a gift emblematic of the Golden State,
typifying its wealth of resources and the
traditions of Its history. '
It Is not alone, sir, that you are President
of the United States that we have prepared
this gift for you, but that we have discovered
In you an appreciation of the romantic tradi
tions and historic grandeur of those early days.
Â¦ Accept it, then, from veterans and pioneers
and native sons of a State most rich in tradi
tion and famed in story and song, and with
it our pledge of esteem and affection.
McKinley was received with thunder
ous applause as he stepped forward to
speak and frequent outbursts of cheers
punctuated his sentences. He said:
Mr. President. My Fellow-Citizens: I
have been absent from the capital of the
nation for now nearly four weeks, and dur
ing that period it seems to me that for the
greater part of the time I have been either
on historic ground or in the midst of sacred
and historic memories. (Applause.) I stood
within the walls of the old building: in the
city of New Orleans where that mijhty
transaction took place which transferred the
vast territory of Louisiana from the flag of
France to the flag of the United States.
(Great applause.) I stood on that sacred
ground in the State of Texas where men fell
for liberty and independence. And now to
day I am brouuht face to face with the
veterans of the Mexican War. with the
pioneers of California and with their sons
and daughters. (Great applause.) It is
a proud honor and privilege to me to pay
my respectful, aye. more, my affectionate
homage to the brave men. who snatched this
territory and dedicated It to freedom for
ever. (Great applause.) And It gives me a
natlsfaction which I cannot find words to
express to meet the builders of the State,
the pioneers of California, the adventurous
youth*, as your president has said, who
penetrated this distant, region In the mem
orable year of '49. (Great applause.) God
bless the veterans of the Mexican War and
the pioneers of California and their de
scendants forever more. (Continued great
applause. )
Liberty and Expansion.
The American people never extend their
territory that they do not extend liberty.
(Enthusiastic apiileause.) When you forty
nlnem came here you brought with you the
eplrit or '76. (Applause.) You brought with
you the traditions, the character, the agplra
tlona, the alms of the Government of the
United States and Its people. (Applause.)

Pleasant Little Breakfast in Home of
Irving M. Scott Before Events
of the Day
Continued From First Page.
r Â¦ > HE President filched a few mln
. 1 utes from his busy morning ye3
1 terday to drive to- the home of
1 Irving M. Scott at 607 Harrison
I street, where he took breakfast
M. with, Mr. Scott and a number of
friends. The breakfast waa
strictly private and a most enjoyable af
fair. The President, relieved of the worry
over the illness of Mr3. McKlnley, Was in
the best of spirits.' and in the congenial
company around the table he enjoyed a
pleasant half hour, leaving with regret
that he could remain no longer.
It was 9 o'clock when. the President left
the Scott home on Laguna and Clay
streets and drove to the Scott ' home on
Harrison street. Waiting to receive him
were Mr. and Mrs. Irving M. Soott, Sec
retary of State John Hay and Mrs. Hay.
Dr. and Mrs. Reginald Knight Smith. Mr.
and Mrs. Charles A. Moore, William
Keith, Miss Barber, Miss Car o Crockett
and Lawrence I. Scott.
There was a wait of a few minutes while
the guests chatted in the parlor and then
all were escorted - to the dining room,
where a dainty little breakfast was ready
to be served. It was a hurried meal, for
the President's day was to be a busy one.
but still there was time for a sociable talk
over the coffee cups/ After the breakfast
the guests were shown the art treasures
of the Scott home, and then the Presi
dent waa driven back' to the house on the
hill just in time to take Op the first of the
functions which the day brought with it.
M EVENING WITH OLD COMRADES
cordial reception. We cannot all of us dwell
on those serene heights of non-partisanship
where the President walks with such dignity
and wisdom, and so for myself. I can say that
I feel nowhere in the world so happy as In a
Re-publican club. (Applause.) I am glad to
be with you here to-day and to congratulate
you upon the splendid work which the Repub
licans of California have done in many hours
of etorm and stress since you became a State
and since the Republican party was founded.
(Great applause.)
Escapes the Handshakers.
The president of the club announced
that the President of tho United States
having other engagements to meet should
be privileged to take his departure.
A rush was made by members to grasp
the hand of the President as he was step
ping from the platform, but the clever
ness of Private Secretary Cortelyou, Chief
Sullivan and others of the President's
party of escort checked the handshaking
movement. The orchestra rendered "The
Star-Spangled. Banner" as the assemblage
dissolved. Many members of the leagu*
lingered . to talk of the affair, and the sen
timent was expressed that the receptior.
would be recorded as one of the greates*
events in the history of the league.
Surrenders the Cliarter.
At the conclusion of the President's hap
py response Post Commander General
Barnes said:
"The purpose for which McKinley Pro
visional Post was established having 1 bee:>
accomplished. I now tender to the Presi
dent of the United States unconditional
surrender of our charter."
The President replied :
"General Barnes. I accept the charter
and promise that I will not lose it."
This closed the exercises.
And all the great powers went and the
day was saved, and It was given to a young
American lad to scale the walla of Peklnj,-.
(Great applause.) And I don't know but he
belonged to California. (Laughter.) The
State has pretty mnch everything. (Con
tinued laughter.) But, my countrymen, we
are not a military people. We don't like
war. We like p ice and we have been pur
suing- peace, with a little war thrown In
(laughter and applause), for while we were
fighting the battles over in the Philippines,
our great captains of Industry, our great
manufacturers and our producers were In
the city of Paris at the great International
exposition maktnir more â¢xhlblta than any
other nation except France and receiving
more prizes far their skill than were
awarded to any other power. (Applause.)
That ia one of the victories of peace that
we are glad to record. We only go to war
to make peace. (Applause.) Wo never went
to war with any other design. We never
went to war with an Ignoble purpose. And
we never fought battles that were not for
liberty and civilization and humanity
(great applause), and I trust we never will:
we carry the national conscience with uÂ»
wherever we go. (Applause.) We respect
property. (Applause.) And we show the
highest humanity. It was that gallant
captain. Robley Evans (applause), who told
the boys to atop firing, that men w.re
drowning, to get out and pick them up.
and hundreds there were brought in safety
to his ships. (Applause.)
Now, my comrades, I am sore you will
excuse me from saying anything more than
to thank you for the privilege you hav*
given me of meeting you here to-night and
telling you how much good it does me to
look into your faces again, to feel your
hearts still throb with patriotism, and to
say to you that the most Interesting years.
whose memories will longest be cherished,
are those from 1S61 to 1S65. And all we have
got to do is to give our loyal support to th"
Government we have saved, and when we
are gone our children and the generations
that are to follow will see to It that this
free government shall be transmitted to tira
generations yet to come, undimtnlshed In
principle and virtue and unabated In vigor
to uphold the interests of the people. (En
thusiastic applause.)
The Day "Was Saved.
Mr. Lincoln said in 1362 that there wai
not a regiment in the service that did not
have In It men capable of being Cabinet
Ministers,, of being members of the Su
preme Court of the United States, and of
filling; the office of chief executive. And
the Grand Army of the Republic has the
exceptional distinction of furnishing from
Its ranks five men to Â»erve as President of
the'Unlted States. (Great applause.) They
nerved with you. fought with you. suffered
with you. and with you shared in the tri
u-nphs of the war.
Not only, my comrades, did we have a
splendid army, but when the war was over
the army constituted a loyal cltUenship.
There Is not a man who served in the Civil
War that was not a better citizen when he
came home (applause), and ever since the
surrender he has been engaged In uphold
ing the â¢ Government that he helped to
save. (Applause.)
There la another thing the Grand Army of
the Republic has done. It contributed from
Its own firesides for the Spanish war.
(Great applause.) A good many of the
veterans went in themselves, but if they
did not go. their sons did. (Applause and
cries of â¢â¢Good.") And I want to tell you.
the boy who livea in a family over which a
Grand Army man presides Is sure to be an
American patrlQt. . (Applause.) And those
boys went and fought our battles in Cuba,
in Porto Rico. In the Philippines and in
China and did honor to their country and
to every old soldier of. the war of 1861.
(Applause.) Was there ever more manly
beliavlor on the part of an army than was
shown by ours in those distant islands and
later In China? When the word came that
our Ambassador a and Ministers and those
of all the powers were In siege and were
being attacked and the Government was
unable to protect them, and when it was
said, and in many quarters believed, that
the lives of every one of them had, been
taken. It was an American officer who
said "TVe will go to Peking: with the men
we have got. and wait no longer for rela
forecementa." (Applause.)

history. Tou and your associates whr>
answered the call of Abraham Lincoln have
accomplished treat deeds for humanity.
You made thlÂ» Government a nation. You
vindicated the principles of government by
the people and macla the declaration of In
dependence,-which for nearly three quarter*
of a century had been only a promise, a
glorious fulfillment. You established ths
fact that free government was not a fail
ure or an experiment, but had demonstrated
its fitness to be numbered among the gTeat
â¢ nation* of the world. You made liberty
universal. You put the constitution of the
United States where it never had been be
fore, and where, under God. it shall stand
forever, with civil and political equality to
every citizen beneath the flag. (Great ap
plause.) And, my comrades, what nobls
manhood made. up that splendid army! We
are in the habit of .*aylng that mustered
for the preservation of the Union was the
best blood of the republic, and It is true.
We had from every State and Territory of
the Union the brightest and the best, the
old and the young and those in middle life;
those who gave up everythingâ home, fam
ily, comfort, wealth, great careers in civil
lifeâ all were grlven up that they might
aave for themselves and their children the

Barnes Presents McKlnley.
In presenting- Comrade McKinley to the
Povisional Post bearing his name Post
Commander W. H. L. Barnes made a
speech of glowing eloquence, which
evoked many demonstrations of enthusl
ann.'r-He'spok* of Comrade McKinley's
career as soldier, legislator and of states
man In the zenith of his glory as President
of the United States. Tributes were paid
in eloquent language to the bravery and
indomitable courage displayed by Ameri
cans in battles on land and sea. An Inci
dent of the famous charge at Mission
Ridge was described by reference to the
recorded fact that General Grant was
about to censure the commander. of a di
vision for advancing 1 his troops beyond
the point designated, but was told that
when the word forward. was given all â
could not check the column. .. 1
Triumphs of the American navy In the
far away purple sea were ' depicted in
glowing words. He pictured to the as
sembled veterans the scenes of 1S61, when
Comrade McKlnley as a boy went to the
front at the call of President Lincoln for
men to preserve the Union. He dwelt
upon the prosperity, the national unity
and the civilizing prestige of the nation
to-day, and closed a burst of masterly
eloquence with a quotation from Daniel
Webster's famous speech, exacting the
sentiment of "liberty and - union now and
forever, one and inseparable."
The fervid eloquence and tender pathos
of the speaker charmed the Illustrious
guest of the evening. At the close of the
speech the President gave the orator a
cordial grasp of the hand.
A. mighty shout of applause went up
when Comrade McKlnley arose to speak.
The President said:
Compliments Barnes.
My Comrades of the Grand Army of the
Republicâ It would have been more pleas
ing to me and I am sure quite as satisfac
tory to you if we had bsen permitted to sit
durlnsr the evening under the spell of the
thrilling eloquence of General Barnes. (Ap
plause.) No one can tell the story of tho

The adjustments reported this afternoon
show a gain in New England of 1500 in
the number of . men returned to work
with the demands granted; of 500 or 600
in Ohio, and i probably 1000 in Pennsyl
vania. About 1000 men struck to-day.
There are some additions in Philadelphia
and some In the Seaboard Air Line shops
Of Americus, Ga. Our policy is to dis
courage bringing out any more men than
is absolutely necessary to effect the suc
cess of the movement."
O'Connell said a strike of the machin
ists on the Seaboard Air Line would oc
cur to-morrow morning. He said the
strikers' would number between 600 and
600. - Advices to . headquarters here lndi
.cate that at San Francisco many of . the
smaller concerns, are ready to grant the
demands, but are not ready to sign the
agreement.' At Indianapolis the American
Bicycle Company is reported as agreeing
to the demands, but refusing to sign the
agreement. The same condition exists
at several other points, and the matter
is being left to organizations to settle.
O'Connell said to-night that he could
not understand such a policy on the part
of employers, . but was .not disposed to
haggle over a minor issue. , He said that
the organization of the men is sufficient
to enforce their demands, and that the
question of signature was comparatively
trifling.

Britain's bonds would sell with equal fa

sold at par and 3 per^ cent bonds would

DEATH TO MANY
will be docked for a thorough examina
tion. Sir Thomas Lipton, George Watson
and W. G. Jameson visited the boat to
day and decided that six weeks would be
sufficient to put the crippled yacht again
in racing trim, and that it will probably
be necessary to ask for a delay In the
day of the cup races for this length of
time. In their opinion, most of the other
spars were fiuite heavy enough and the
whole trouble arose from the breaking of
a Hhroud and the bobstay fastenings. .
Sir Thorfias Lipton takes the accident
philosophically, but the comments of the
men show that this culminating misfor
tune, coming on top of the minor acci
dents which have happened at nearly
every trial, has quite taken the heart' out
of the crew. Past mishaps, which were
glossed over at the time of occurrence,
are now magnified, and not one of the
crew has a good word to say for the boat.
It is now admitted tnat all are. bitterly
disappointed â¢with her form as' against
that of the old boat, and the general hope
is expressed that Sir Thomas Upton will
decide to build a new yacht before sailing
off his challenge.
LONDON, May 23.â An editorial In tho
Yachtsman, written before the accidents
to the Shamrock, says: "The trials of tho
two Shamrocks have shattered our faith
In the new boat. Wo cannot sec what
prospect of success Lipton has."
Tugs were out all day searching for the
spar and gear that were. cut adrift, but
owing to the rough sea thqy found only a
topsail yard.
A German salvaee company will bo
asked to send steamers to continue the
search, for although the recovery of the
blocks, gear and iittings in this way will
cost more than It would take to replace
them, it is believed 'that time will be
saved. It is thought that tho sails are
destroyed or buried in the sand.
As soon as arrangements can be made
the Shamrock 11 will. bo towed to the
Clyde and handed over to tho Dennys. Or
ders for new spars were sent off an hour
after the accident and the work. on these
la already well under way. ' .
PHILADELPHIA, May 23.â With elo
Â«ju<-ncÂ« born Â©f tho pol?mn Importance of
the Question. commte*lotieri* to the J'reÂ»
byterian General Aawmbly to-day began
in* debate on the rpvlgion of tho Con
t< ?r)nn of Faith. I'.r illlimt leaders of the
church advanced their views In a, calm,
d!*pa*glonate manner, and the entire dlÂ»
rurKion was devoid of acrimony. With u.
full realization, of the great Importance
of the subject, tho assembly proceeded
to consider and investigate thoroughly
every detail of the proposed changes in
the creed.
Calvary Church was not large enough
to accommodate the throngs who clam
ored for admission. Many of the spec
tators did not leave the church during
the noon recess. Although frequently re
quested to avoid demonstrations, the au
dience repeatedly applauded the speakers.
Among the audience were many clergy
men of other denominations. Rev. Dr.
Herrick Johnson and Rev. Dr. Samuel J.
Niccolls aroused the unbounded enthusi
asm of the audience by .their brilliant
presentation of the revision faction's rea
sons for desiring a change.
Rev. Dr. George T. Purves spoke
against revision, as did Rev. Dr. George
D. Baker. Dr. McKibben favored a modi
fied change. There are 250 commissioners
committed to dismissal, but they have
expressed themselves as open â¢ to convic
tion. â¢'

Debate. .
SOUTHAMPTON'. May 23.-At a
conference of his constructors
and advisers held this afternoon
on board the Erin Sir Thomas
Lipton told the gentlemen that he
was determined to go ahead with Sham
rock II. and left it to them to decide how
this best could be done. He had a Ion?
discussion with Watson, the designer of
the Shamrock II; Ratsey, the sailmaker;
Wand, manager for the Dennys, builders
of the yacht; Captain Sycamore, her skip
per, and. Hilliard and Ure, amateur
yachtsmen, "who have been sailing on
board the Shamrock II, and it was agreed
to cable the Kew York Yacht Club, asking
that the date of the contest be postponed
until the first week in October, in order
to allow time for the necessary repairs.
This extension will give the designers and
Ratsev time to do their part of the work-
It was decided to lose no time, but to go
ahead under full pressure while awaiting
reply from the New York Yacht Club as
10 whether the postponement would be
granted. . ...
Sir Thomas Upton expressed himself as
extremely sorry for being forced to make
any request upsetting the arrangements
alieady made, but he was left with only
the hull of his yacht. Without this ex
tension of time he would be totally un
able to bring his boat over in anything
like good form, and he said he sincerely
hoped his request would be granted.

Speaking of the Â¦ improvements on" the
Shamrock I, Sir Thomas Bald he had no
doubt that this yacht had improved much

that he felt perfectly certain she was far

6ir Thomas has received dozens of ca
bles of sympathy from the United States
and hundreds of similar telesTams from
all parts of Great Britain. Thomas W.
lAV.Hon cabled to Sir Thomas his deepest
mrret at the accident and his heartiest
<-ongTatulations that all on board had es

ho deprived of seeing the Shamrocks this
reason but if It were impossible to bring
them over he expressed his wMjngnesa
to take the Independence over to Lnpland

in British waters. Sir Thomas replied to

fer, which he thoroughly appreciated, but
he said he waÂ» going over with the nev
Shamrock, and if an opportunity offered
he would be delighted to race the Inde

Â« An engraving that shows a view from
the capitol grounds at Washington in 1825
discloses that Pennsylvania avenue was
planted with Lombardy poplars. They,
began to be imported to America soon
after the revolution, and their popularity
grew through the advocacy of Jefferson.
They came to be regarded as a symbol of
democracy and the domination of French
ideas. They were therefore profoundly
hated in some communities. -In-Salenva

night by ardent federalists. They "were,
planted along the new turnpikes which,
.were being built eveÂ«y where. . But few of
these old poplars still, stand anvwhere in

killed old settlers" and some 3craggly
young growth. They proved a 'poor sub

1820 there was so much display, of dress

'Scant Education for Girls.

When such an offense is committed from such a

happy and contented in Hawaii
It was their right to migrate from one part of the
country to the other, and to prudently provide for
their welfare by covering their future by a contract.
The tornadoes and political changes, in Porto Rico
had rendered such migration, either temporary or per
manent, a necessity to them. California is in every
way unsuited to them. They have no knowledge of
our industries and no skill in their pursuit. They find
no place here into which they fit" The Examiner's
fake condemned them to misery and exile. Under
the pretense of a humane purpose it inflicted in
humanity upon them, used them for its mean purpose
and abandoned them to their fate.
The Porto Ricans of the same party who went on
to Hawaii are happy and contented, and their reports
sent back are the means of inducing many others to"
follow them to* the Pacific."
The Examiner did not scruple to misrepresent and
deceive these poor people to advertise itself.

THE Examiner is just "now advertising itself by
another race around the globe. The time since
ladies were doing that racing for newspapers as

fake renewable. The last effort of that paper to
attract attention by other; than legitimate newspaper
methods was its crocodiling over the Porto Ricans
who were migrating to Hawaii on labor contracts. It
sent a corps of "commissioners" to meet their train,
and by industrious lying about the islands and the
slavery into which they were being entrapped induced
a number of them to desert. The public has not for
gotten the snivel and snort which filled columns. It
assumed guardianship of its dupes who deserted and
continued to use them as sandwichmen to advertise it
until the fake was played out Now those deserters
are deserted by the Examiner, and some of them have
been reported as public charges on the counties to
which they were sent.

When they left the > dame ".school their

taught seventy years. Josiah Quincy said
he studied it through twenty times before

WASHINGTON,, May 23.â The following
CALITORNIANS IN" WASHINGTON"
; It will be seen that the preparations for the face'
are in a most unsatisfactory condition. If Lipton
comes over with a hastily patched up yacht to compete
with a yacht . whose owners have barred out other
yachts from competition, it is not likely thete will be
much satisfaction to any, one no matter how the
contest goes. : . , â¢ . ' * -
The word "any", in that clause is construed by
Boston yachtsmen as entitling their yacht to enter
the trials. Secretary Bliss of the Massachusetts Yacht
-Racing Association says: "I do not see' how the In
dependence can be shut out from the trial ..races. u.n-,
der the deed of gift except by the most arbitrary ac
tion on-.th'e part of the New ( York Yacht-Club." On
the other side a member of the New York club is
quoted as saying: '-The America's cup is in the cus
tody of the New York Yacht Club, and it isthe re
sponsible custodian and probably, will remain so" as
long as the cup is held on this side of the water. The
challenge for the, cup was. made to the New York
Yacht-Club and must be raced for under the rules
agreed upon. The club isjresponsible for the conduct
of the race, and if Mr. Lawson wants to come. in he
must submit to these rules just as Sir Thomas Lip
ton must." , . \
Th. e Boston men base. their claim to a right to en
ter the trial races; upon a claus'e in the deed of gift
by which the survivors of the syndicate that built
the America 'turned the famous cup over to the New
York Yacht Club. The clause runs as follows: "Any
organized yacht club of a foreign country, incorpor
ated, patented or licensed by the Legislature, Ad
miralty or other executive department, having for its
annual regatta an ocean watercourse on the sea or
an arm of the sea, or one which combines both, shall
always' be entitled to the right of sailing a match for
the cup with any yacht propelled with sails only and
constructed in the country to which the challenging
yacht belongs, against any- one yacht or vessel con
structed in the country of the club holding the cup."
The wreck of the Shamrock II shows that she was
not strongly constructed, and for â¢ that defect
Thomas Lipton himself .appears to be to blame.' It
was announced long ago. that the' designer of "the
yacht desired to make her, fit for the heavy seas
around the. British, Islands, but that J Sir Thomas-had
been so impressed by. the light winds and quiet seas
that prevailed off New Y^ork harbor at the time of his
first contest that he forbade the construction of a
heavyweather boat, and insisted upon one of lighter
build. He has now had occasion to repent; of his
folly, but it is announced he is as determined as ever
to make the race with Shamrock II and will spare no
expense - f tb have her ready if a f postponement be
granted.
. . The wrangle between the New York Yacht Club
and Thomas W. Lawson and his Boston colleagues
will not be settled as easily as Shamrock II can be
repaired. The New Yorkers have decided that the
Independence shall not be permitted to enter the
trial races andcompete for the privilege of defending
the cup. The decision*is final so far as the race is
concerned, for the New Yorkers hold the cup; but it
has increased rather than settled the agitation on the
subject, for~under the decision it will not be known
whether the defender is the best yacht that American
skill can construct, and consequently the public in
terest in the event will be less than it would other
wise have been. .
THE '' AMERICA'S*; CUP CONTEST.
EVERYTHING goes wrong this year with the
preparations that are being made: for the 'inter-'
national yacht race for the ; America's cup!
Sir Thomas Lipton's new challenger, after having
been beaten in one test; by I, has been
almost completely wrecked, and it is said . to be
doubtful if she can be made ready for a match even
if the event be postponed '.to a monthlater than the
date fixed. 'That will,, of course, tend to weaken
British interest in the race, while in this- country the
unfortunate; wrangle between the New York Yacht
Club ;'and ; the Boston_ men' who have constructed the
yacht'Independerice to'compete for the honor of de
fending the cup has .been almost as depressing to
American interest. In fact, it. is a bad year for .the
contest, and perhaps no_one would be very sorry if
the event were postponed for 1 a*. year.
We submit to the President that this is grossly un
fair treatment of California. The Chinese, instead of
resisting the purgation of Chinatow*n, have effec
tively co-operated with, the Governor in that work.
They are not fairly under suspicion of concealing
anything. Their conduct" might well be imitated by
the officials, who will privately admit themselves, to
be wrong in reporting the April case but refuse to
make that,.admission public.
It is a matter of vast importance to hundreds of
thousands of people in California. The President has
been with us. He has broken bread and eaten salt in
cur tents, and.it Js_ not' too much to expect tha,t he
will do what he may to lift this incubus from the
prosperity of the State* A consultation between him
and the State' authorities would be highly proper, to
arrange a common ground of action.
Here, then, we have the testimony of the sick and
death rate of both races, and the fearless compla
cency of the Chinese themselves, and the testimony
of our most reputable physicians that "the ailment
alleged to be the plague has been identified in China
town constantly for thirty years, being nothing more
than a disease and complications not unknown
among white people but modified by. the peculiarities
of the Asiatic constitution. Yet the report that we
have the plague persists, and receives, we regret to
say, official countenance. To show what this amounts
to let Â£ne fact be stated. ;The report of the surgeon
general shows one case of bubonic plague in San
Francisco in April. Upon attention being called to
it and an investigation being made it was demon
strated that the report was wrong, and the admission
is on record that the case was not plague at all. Jus
tice required that the Federal and local health ser
vice'should publish this admission. " Nothing could
.have, gone further to. overtake, the untrue statement
that the plague exists. But was this done? No. The
officials would go no further than to omit the false
report. from subsequent bulletins of the ensuing
months! . Â¦
As far as the vital, statistics of the Chinese are con
cerned, their sophistication is impossible under the
regulations of the law and the customs of those peo
ple. Every one of their dead must be returned to
China to rest with his family and his ancestors. This
is the highest obligation of the living to the dead
Chinese. It is under such regulation that the identi
fication and numbering of the dead must be accurate
or this obligation cannot be discharged. So no con
cealment in Chinatown is possible. But there is an
other''evidence better than anything else. The Presi
dent and nearly all of his Cabinet have been. in San
Francisco for a long time. The Governor of Ohio
and members of Congress from that State sojourned
here and saw the town at leisure. The Governor of
Oregon and the Governor of Arizona have been here,,
with the same opportunity for observation. Most
of these gentlemen have been back and forth through
Chinatown.. They have seen its teeming streets and
visited its theaters, temples/ restaurants and stores
by day and by night. They have seen the Chinese
going about their business and their places at all
hours, with no sign of fear or panic upon them, i
Now the Chinese know the. plague, its signs and
symptoms^. as..thoroughly. as. do -the bacteriologists. -
They know it as we, do smallpox, and 'shun it in greater!
fear. "As the Governor of California has pointed out,'
if plague were in Chinatown not all the ropes that
could be stretched, around it,, nor all the troops the .
Yresiderit saw at the Presidio, could keep the Chi
nese there. They run from it as we run from small
pox and cholera, and recognize it as plainly and as
quickly.
. One heed not resort to the microscope to demon
strate this. During the entire period since the world
was frightened and Chinatown was roped in between
midnight and morning the sick rate and death rate
here have not advanced a point beyond normal.
These rates in Chinatown have been, if changed at all,
below normal and average. But, when this showing
is made, the reply of the Federal authorities has been
that this very condition is suspicious, and implies that
the rates of sickness and death are being sophisticated.
This charge is untrue. It is known that. the local
Board of Health has ; striven to prove its original
statement that plague was here.-* It has- charge of our
vital statistics, and any sophistication would be" more
likely in the interest of the board's position. ./Â¦
THE time has come when California must strive
earnestly to get ju-stice'in regard to ,the bubonic
plague scare," which is" already an incubus upon
our industries and threatens at any time to effect their
destruction. No matter what may be said or done by
men who" are under bonds to professional -courtesy,
or are unwilling to change preconceived opinions that
were not justified at their- formation, there is no bu
bonic plague in San Francisco nor in California!

It is not likely : Quay's retirement from political
leadership .will be so complete' as is" asserted in that
speech. His words .vyere evidently' spoken in a mood
of despondency, the natural reaction the ardent
feelings that animated him \while the fight waygoing

to the fray, as eagerly as ever, j None the less his words
are interesting as an .illustration of the essential vanity
of human ambition.^ If -the. speech of Quay in his
triumph were placed" alongside 'the letter written by
Ingalls when he learned of his -defeat, the contrast
between /the, two . would be striking. \ The
statesman, in the actual loneliness of his Kansas farm,
was cheerful and serene, while the victor, amid the
shouting thousands of .his admirers, felt his life gliding
through a wilderness almost desolate.

It was the annual basket-ball gamo be

Mission High School and the seniors won
out by a narrow margin from the agile
juniors, the score standing 15 to 11 when
hostilities ceased. The contest was waged
in the gymnasium of the high school, and
fully 200 girls enjoyed.it. As usual, man
was barred from watching the game.
Many of the male scholars agreed to pay

When one of the players made a par
ticularly clever play the maids on thÂ©
side lines, yelled "Goody-good" and used
other strong adjectives to emphasize their
pleasure.
The senior team sported the cardinal,
while the juniors wore the blue. The par

their team and yelled encouragement with
the abandon of a lot of college "rooters."
Both teams showed good form and played
cleverly. Miss Augusta G. Kelly, a pop
ular teacher of thej school, had coached
the teams, and she was assigned the ardu

shirtwaist and golf skirt, the referee
made a pretty picture in thÂ© center of the

NEW YORK, May 23.â Commando, the
eon of Domino, won the classic Belmont
stake at Moms Park to-day and stamped
himself the best three-year-old of recent
years. He was a strong favorite in the
betting at 7 to 10, made all the running
ana won galloping by two lengths in 2:2L
the track record for the distance. It was
the last day of the Westcnester Racing
Association's spring meeting, and a crowd
of at least 15,000 people was in attendance.
Only three horses went to the post for the
Belmont. Commando and The Parader both
opened at even money, the former being
backed to 7 to 10, while The Parader went
up to 7 to 5. All Green went begging at
15 to 1. They were sent off on the first
break to a good start, and Spencer took
Commando to the front and led by two
lengths up the backstretch. Going up the
hill The Parader moved up to him, and
they ran neck and neck around the far
turn. For a few jumps The Parader
showed in front, but it was only on suf
ferance, and when Spencer called on Com
mando at the head of the stretch he came
away and won easily. The Parader was
under the whip through the last furlong
in a fruitless effort to get up. All Green
was a bad third. Commando got an ova
tion when he returned to the scales. Sum

fij-rf-^HE atmosphere of the Olympic
I Club last night during the 'second
1 and final installation of the boxing
ii. . tournament was free from squalls
on the -outside- of .-the ring, but
"stormy and choppy within the ropes. A
larger crowd gathered to see the finals,
and the sport was of better quality than
on the night preceding. Ed Smith of the
Reliance Club acted as referee, neither of
the belligerents, J. B. Smith or President
Greer Harrison, being. in evidence.
As a chief 'morsel the Snailham-Hag
gerty match for the 115-pound champion
ship was preserved until' the last. It went
the three full rounds, but Snailham's
rooster action and spiral arm twists were
too much for scissor-like Haggerty, so
Greggains' pet will wear another medal
on his chest. All Haggerty will have to
wear Is his clothes.
W. J. Leonard and Danny Danziger,
both of the Olympic Club, fought it out
for the 125-pound honors. For two rounds
Danziger set the pace and scored a slight
advantage. Then Leonard broke loose,
and when the .gong sounded the end of the
fistic embroglio Danziger was beginning
to see strange lights and hear strange
sounds. These two fought before, Dan-

James Pallas of the South End Rowing
Club and Mat Breen of the Olympic v Club
came together for the welter-weight med
al. In the first round Breen was knocked
down twice, the last time remaining on
his knees after ten had been' counted. â¢
Harry Foley of the Ariel Rowing Club
brought William Kelly to terms in the
third round j of the middle-weight finals.
He placed a stiff right four times in suc
cession on Kelly's chin, and the i latter
forgot to get up when the referee had
done with his arm-swinging.
Then came the 168-pound class, which C.
Mllward of the Olympic Club won from
Charles Gallavin of the Pacific Athletic
Club. Milward got the decision.
Hammer and tongs was the heavy
weight fight between Joseph Millet of the
San Francisco Athletic Club and Gus Mac-
Intyre of the Olympic Club. Millet seemed
to be in bad siiape during a part of the
second round and Maclntyre accordingly
grew gay. Then , something happened to
him. A right-nand smash of Milletâ the
mallet landed on his chin. The referee
did not even take time to count, and the
crowd knew that the question of revival
was one of minutes, not seconds. Macln

Track Notes.
RACING was resumed by the Cali
fornia Jockey Club at Oakland
track yesterday before the usual
crowd of racegoers. The track
. was fast and favorites captured
three of the six events decided. F. 12.
Mulholland replaced Jake Holtman as
Etarter, and with one exception his work
was uo to the average.
The sport opened with a sprint over the
Futurity course, for which Jerld. ridden
by llenrr Shields, ruled an even money
choice. The chestnut horse did his best
tor a time, then faded away to nothing.
Glissacdo assumed the lead in the stretch,
beating out Rio Chico a length. .
Hoar had the mount on Mike Strauss,
favorite for the six-furlong run that fol
lowed acd won all the way. Ruiz on El
Mido arrived in time to down Irate four
lengths for the place. Screenwell Lake
was probably afraid to drop into better
than fourth position.
Once in a -while, when the coin Is down
right, "Chub" Russell does put up a good
ride, but the Judges have certainly stood
for his coarse work a long time. He had
the mount on Carlo, which closed a slight
favorite over Achilles for the live and a
half furlong dash for two-year-olds and,
riding an excellent race, wpn easily from
the first choice. Daady, a CO to 1 shot,
ran third. Ccllis. who had a world of
trouble around the California circuit,
obligingly pulled up Huachuca.
Fortune favored Jim Hale, favorite for
the rive and a half furlong scramble fol
lowing, and only for a streak of good luck
he would never have won. Bassinger on
the 40 to 1 shot Gaylon Brown succeeded
in bea-ting the barrier after an extended
delay, caused by the unruly actions of
Rio de Altar, but his mount could not
last out. Collis brought Hale up just in
time to beat Rio de Altar a neck on the
wire.
Three noses on the wiie marked the fin
ish of the sprint next decided. Valen
cienne, piloted by Collis, ruled favorite,
and after striking the stretch second to
Midlove was placed third to Vantine and
Mocorito in the closest fit of the dav.
Russell rode the winning mare, which was
bet on by his clique.
On the ferry-boat home some very tart
remarks were made over the result of
the closing: mile run, taken by Hagerdon,
the favorite. Sullivan's ride on Rio Shan
r.on, the second horse, beaten but a neck,
came in for caustic comment, and it must
be admitted that the rider's effort was
6imply shameful. Basslnger's piloting of
Goldone was no better.

LOS ANGELES,
The fielding: throughout the game was
good, but not sensational. Brockhoff mis
judged a couple of flies and Arrellanes
lost control of his top piece in a critical
moment. Both pitchers twirled in good
form, but in the fifth and sixth innings
Jones suffered a slight bunching of safe
ones. The score:
In the fifth Oakland was lucky, Francks
and Lohman scoring, chiefly on a poor
decision by Donohue. In the sixth Dun
leavy rolled out a 'two-bagger and scored
on Francks' two -bagger.
Several weeks have elapsed since the
Los Angeles team has played on a local
diamond and the home fanatics have been
hungry for a sight of the nine orangemen
who did so well the last time up. They
did fairly well yesterday, but were not
lucky, nor did they find Moskiman with

MANY CHINESE CROSS

American Immigration Commissioner
in Vancouver Beports on In
sufficiency of the Barriers.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 23.â David E.
Healy, the American Immigration Com
missioner at this port, has just sent a re
port to Washington dealing with the num
ber of ' Orientals who are crossfng the
boundary line from Canada into the
States. The Commissioner has just re
turned from a visit to several places along
the border, and he says that the inspec
tion Is now so Incomplete that Chinese can
cross the line nearly anywhere between
the coast and Ryckerts, B. C, a distance
of 400 miles. At the Oriental Commission
In this city recently evidence was given
that very few of the Chinese who arrived
in Canada from the Orient went back the
same way they came, but all made for the
southern side oi the line. Commissioner
Healy thinks that, the year around, there
are a hundred Chinese every week who
unlawfully crosa the boundary line. ; .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B.-C, May 23.â Because
the survey of 1S59 was indifferently done
Canada has been occupying a piece of ter
ritory about seven miles wide through the
Mount Baker District, which has all this
time rightfully belonged to the United
States.
J. M. McArthur, the Canadian Commis
sioner, who will act with the American
Commission under J. B. Sinclair, arrived
her yesterday after' a short look over the
Mount Baker District. He says that the
result of the short survey made last fall
by the Canadian Goverrnment was to
show that the line should be some dis
tance north of where it has been supposed
for so long to be. There are half a dozen
large gold mines and many promising
claims now in the district and these will
all go to the American side.
When the survey was made in the early
days it was left incomplete because ! tho
country was rough. It was frequently
twenty miles .between posts and the lat
ter were placed wherever convenience
suggested, for^the surveyors then consid
ered that they were so far from civiliza
tion that it would never matter. Now the
whole line la to be renewed from the
western base to the main Rocky Moun
tains to the coast, and the Canadian Com
missioner thinks that the United States
will have decidedly the best of it. As it
now is, both Americans and Canadian
customs officers are claiming: property at
the boundary, and since the trouble last
autumn business has been at a stand
still. Professor Macoun. an eminent geolo
gist, will accompany the party through
the districts and the finished survey will
likely take in the- neighborhood of three
years to accomplish. â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦' Â£

W., WASHINGTON, May 23.-Instead of
belnjr assigned to duty In the United
States upon the expiration of their pres
ent leaves of absence Brigadier General
Fred D. Grant and Major General J. C.
Bates will return to their stations In the
Philippines. At the same time a compara
tively large number of officers with the
rank of major general and brigadier gen
eral who will shortly be available In con
sequence of the suppression of the rebel
lion in the Philippines will probably fill
departmental commands In this country.
When Major General Arthur MacArthur
returns to this country he will probably
be given a short leave of absence and will
then be given command of the I>epart
ment of Dakota. This department Is now
under command of Major General Otis,
who Is also In command of the Depart
ment of the Lakes. Major General Shaf
ter will be relieved next, month of the
command of the departments of Califor
nia and Columbia by Major General S. B.
M Young. The Department of Columbia
will eventually be separated from the De
partment of California. A separation will
also occur In the commands of the De
partment of Missouri and Department of
Colorado, now under Brigadier General
H. C. Merrlam. . M
Â¦ . The Department of Texas is commanded
by Colonel C. McKlbbin, Twelfth Infan
try, and will be available for the assign
ment of an officer of higher rank. There
Is also talk in army circles not authori
tative of the re-establlshment of the De
partment of the Gulf, with headquarters
at Atlanta. Ga. Four commands for offi
cers of the grade of major general and
brigadier general will thus be provided.
As it will be necessary to keep 40.000 men
In the Philippines, half of the brigadier
generals must be retained In the archi
pelago. __^_

Since the day that Maxine Elliott and
Nat Goodwin presented "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" upon the greensward In
May, 1895. there has not been a more
epectacular or pleasing entertainment at
Stanford. The travesty entitled "The
Princess of Leeland" Is the Joint produc
tion of W. M. Erb, '.01, and C. M. Brad
lev, "01. The plot presents tw'o suitors for
the hand of the beautiful Princess Lee
land, one the repulsive and dissipated
King of Milpitas. the other Phillip of Pes
cadc-ro. the man of science In disguise.
The Klzig of Leeland has made an offer
of the hand of his daughter In marriage
to any one who shall kill a monster
dragon which la laving waste his estates.-
With this as a basis the authors .have
created many thrilling and laugnable
scenes. Throughout the v play local hits

CHURCH RALLY
WILL BE HELD
Beginning Saturday, June 1, the Santa
Fe will operate its new freight station
at Francisco street, on the Harbor Com
missioners' Belt line tracks, just opposite
the south end of section 2 of the seawall.
Thereafter all outbound less than carload
shipments of freight -will be handled
there instead of at Spear-street terminal,
as at present. Freight in ' carload lots,
both inbound and outbound, | will be
handled as at present, to wit, at either
Spear-street terminal or on the Belt line
tracks, as may. at the time be most con
venient. All inbound merchandise in less
than carload lots will continue to be han
dled at Spear-street terminal, as hereto
fore, and at this place the principal local
office will be maintained. This will prove
a great convenience to the commission
merchants and others shipping in less
than carload Quantities to San Joaquln
Valley points.
On and after June 3 the Santa Fe will
discontinue the daily service of the Cali
fornia limited. The train will Â¦ be dis
patched semi-weekly, leaving this city on
Mondays and Thursdays. The overland
time schedule will be faster through the
San-Joaquin Valley, and the train that
leaves here every day at 4:20 will In the
future run to Fresno, while in the past the
trip terminated at Stockton.
H. E. Fitzhugh, formerly, of the Ver
mont road, is still in San Francisco." He
stated yesterday that there had been no
change in the situation as far as he is
concerned since his arrival here. He has
been away several. weeks, and during that
time has been traveling over the entire
Southern Pacific system -In- the 'southern
part of this State and has even gone as
far as the Mojave Desert; By old railroad
men this' is looked upon as- an ; effort on
Fitzhugh's part to get thoroughly : conver
sent with- the workings of the-road -before
he accepts any position that President
Hays may offer him. . Â¦ Â¦â¢ Â¦ .Â¦ .Â¦;â¢_;â¢-.
Sproule said yesterday that It will be
impossible to run 1 on the time that the
fruit growers demand unless the fruit is
consigned in trainload lots to one given
point. Under this . new time . table, fruit
shipped from Sacramento on a. Monday
before midnight will arrive in Chicago
the following Monday . morning. In that
time 'a deduction has to be ma.de for the
inspection of the fruit at Â¦ Ogden, ,. which
consumes two hours, and two hours more
are -lost -in the change ; = from' "Pacific to
Central time.
The Southern Pacific Company has
made extensive preparations tor the hand*
ling of deciduous fruit this fall. .William
Bproule, freight traffic manager : of tho
company, gave out yesterday, a brief
schedule of the rapid manner In which the

The Star of Bengal left Chemainus on
the 13th lnst. and ran into some heavy
weather off Flattery. Captain Henderson
was BUffering'from a sore throat when the
vessel left the Sound, but thought the sea
air would cure him. The storm off the
coast made him worse, however, and he
decided to run for San Francisco. On the
pilot-boat Captain Henderson could^ only
speak In a whisper and he. seemed to suf
fer a great deal. It will be some time be
fore he can leave the hospital.
As soon as the owners of the Star of
Bengal were notified of Captain Hender
son's illness they at once secured the
services of Captain Uhlbergr, who went
out to the bark and took command. The
vessel was at once put on her course and
â¢before sundown was Â¦well on her wav to
Australia.- Captain Uhlberg. who took
command of the Star of Bengal, was for
merly in the Abby Palmer and is well
known on the coast. Should Captain Hen
derson recover in time he may sail on the
Mariposa for Australia to resume com
mand of his vessel.

For fifty years the Schlitz Rg

They are twenty years old FrO

Schlitz beer was famous in mj3,
Siberia before a railroad was WM
thought of. fM
When Japan and China Hi
first began to awake, Schlitz ggj
beer was advertised in their HR
cewspapers. Kj^
Almost as soon as Dewey hjfm
captured Manila 216 car- IS|
loads of Schlitz were sent B|
there. â¢Â» K|>l
Today Schlitz agencies so LJ
dot the globe that when it is KS
midnight at one it is noon- md

The quality by which Qy
Schlitz beer has won distinc- M|

CHICAGO, May 23.â The wheat market
opened with a display of strength seemingly
out of harmony with the extent of the wet
ting which the crop has received and the fact
that cables were indifferent. July opened un
changed to He lower at 73&@73Hc, touched
1i%z and then reacted to 73H@73Vic during the
first half-hour of bear activity. Heports of fly
damages from the North Central States and
repetitions of German claims of deterioration
of both rye and wheat, combined with a good
demand for spot, caused covering by shorts
under which July during the next half-hour
rallied to 73%S'74c. Long wheat was for sale
at this advance and as the Â¦ market began to
show an easier tone the bear party resumed
operations and forced July back to 72%c. Here
the market steadied on the export sales, re
ported at sixty-six loads, and the' close was He
lower at 73!ic
The feature of operations in the corn pit was
the liquidation by Phillips of 3,600,000 bushels
of May corn, believed to be the lost of the
heavy line accumulated during his manipula
tion of the market. This was sold between
'the high prce, 47Vic and 43c. At one time the
July, September and May corn were all quoted
at one price. July was weakened by heavy re
ceipts, lower cables, the decline In May and
fine growing weather. July closed %o lower
at 44Vic. May closed 4Ko down at 4 Hie
Oats were fairly active, but steady when the
corn weakness and the good weather are con
sidered. July closed HÂ®'/ic lower at 2S%@
2$%o.
Provisions opened firm and held steady for a
time, but eased off In sympathy with .corn.
Trade was quiet. July pork and lard each

on the advance was very heavy, blocks of 6000

V8rjflc was the first stock to show notable
weakness, possibly due to the fact that the
KovÂ«>rnl:jg committee of the Stock Exchange at
yesterday's meeting refrained from action on
the orrilicatlon of the company to list $100,-
UiO.eOO of convertible bends. London was an
active seller during the <Jay. The lesson of the
Northern Pacific corner was shown by the
timidity of arbitrage brckers about going short
of stock even on arbitrage account, where a
purchase in London had first been made against
t!ie sale here. Northern Pacific sold up to 205
during the day. The demand was believed to
be due to the requirements of London shorts. .

cislon'i-uspending tha rule for buying In of
Northern Pacific stock until June 10. But the
movement of the Etock Indicated that the Lon
don shorts had received some sort of warning
to prepare for a settlement. Anything con
nected with the Northern Pacific corner has
not lost its power to disquiet and it was a
disturbing Influence to-ciay. The statement of
the Hank of England for the week and the
hardening of the London money market lifted
the sterling rate to a higher level. The sharp
advance in sterling in Paris indicated the re
lief there over the closing- of subscriptions to
the Russian loan and suggested a cessation of
pressure for gold. Exchange experts, however,
believe that more gold will go out from New
York â¢ this week. The final selling movement
In the etock market carried prices down from
2 to over 4 points. The weakness was severest
in the leading grangers. Pacincs, trunk lines

Dried Fruit in Nrju York.
Mall reports from New Tork say:
"Conditions In the dried fruit trade are very
quiet, business being almost entirely of a band
to-mouth character. Prunes are not at all
plentiful, but with the light demand, the mar
ket Is barely steady. The very small sizes,
from 100s up, are in a tairly good request from
jobbers at our quotations. This size Is in light
supply et the moment. There are a number
of lots of very poor stuff of all sizes on the
market, holders selling; at almost anything: they
can get. California raisins are dull in a Job
bing way. Seeded are In fair demand from the
consumptive trade.
Imported Valencia raisins are meeting good
request from tbe Canadian trade, some fair
sized lots selling from 4Â»4@5Â»i in bond. Hallo-
Mi and Khadrawl dates are dull and easy.
There Is a little demand for Sairs. which are
quoted at 2%c Figs meet with a steady small
request. Low rrades are most wanted. Cur
rants are firm, but actual business is not ex
tensive, the trade generally not being anxious
to buy at the advance. Low grade peaches con
tinue in some demand, sales being reported at
b@5*Ac in bars.
Evaporated apples are firmer but quiet. Hold
ers ask 5%c for prime, with buyers still bid
ding 4%c. Chops are quiet. Waste is quite ac
tive and is higher. Bales of several cars are
reported at $1. Something: of a feature of the
consumptive trade in dried fruits is a consider
ably more active demand for apples, due un
questionably to the late season for fresh
fruits."

WHEATâ There are signs of a livelier mar
ket at Chicago. Phillips, who worked the Corn
deal, has entered the wheat pit and was trying
to break the market yesterday. Liquidation of
long wheat caused an advance In the morning,
and there was considerable short selling. Ship
ping business wan disappointing. The feeling
afterward became easier on moderate rains,
which led to some bear prenaure. Htlll later the
tone was firmer, and the shorts covered on re
ports of serious damage by Hessian fly devel
oping In Indiana, Another source of strength
waÂ« the free bidding for a large quantity for
German account. Iiroomhall cabled that the
official German report announced that 47 per
cent .of the wheat and 11 per cent of the rye
area had been abandoned. Wall street bought
July; the Southwest also bought freely and
nfty.three loads were taken for export at New
York. These bullish conditions rendered hold
ers very firm, and gave strength to the market.
This market opened firm on call, but subse
quently fell hank.

through General Francis M. Greene, one

communicated with the War Department
this morning anoV informed Secretary Root
that the five young men had called upon
him in a contrite and repentant state of
mind, asking for his advice and assist
ance in shaping their future. They stated
that no turpitude was involved in any
thing that was charged against them, and
General Greene apparently was of the
same opinion, for after hearing their
story he proposed to Secretary Root to
employ the men in the service of the as
phalt company. Secretary Root promptly
responded that the "War Department had
no objection, and that it was true there
was no charge touching the integrity of
the boys, but only a technical violation of
discipline. So one of the young men will
go immediately to -Venezuela, General
Greene having taken them into his ser

The fact that the city and county has
lost $61,513 58 delinquent taxes on an as
sessment on the franchise, fixtures, sol
vent credits, agency - accounts, coin and
20 per cent raise ordered in 1896 by the
Board of Equalization on "Wells, Fargo &
Co 's bank will probably result in a
change in the system heretofore employed
to collect delinouent taxes. For some
vears past the labor of collecting delin
quent taxes has been entrusted to npecial
attorneys, but an effort will be made to
place this responsibility upon the shoul
ders of the City Attorney.
Speaking about the Wells-Fargo case
City Attorney Lane said:
This case- was brought and conducted by
special counsel, engaged, I presume, by the
Tax Collector, and properly so within his
charter-given authority. The City - Attorney
ehould have charge of all suits for delinquent
taxes. At present I have no knowledge of
what delinquent tax suits are brought, nor
how they were conducted nor what their re
sult. . .
The change that I suggest would do away
with all temptation to cinch the unfor.tunate
delinquent taxpayer, of which there has been
so much complaint. There Is no reason m
the world why a man who has paid all but
say 5 cen*s of his taxes should be compelled
to pay ?2 or $3 coetB. The amount . of fees
which could be imposed as costs - should be
regulated by law, and If ..the work werÂ« done
throuph the City Attorney's office such costs
should not be hlsher than a few cents. Â¦
A change of a few lines in the charter would
effect this, and I have no doubt the city
would be the gainer. _

his chosen profession, while the ink is
scarcely dry upon the diploma that con

Southard has announced to his friends
that he has accepted a position with the
James Neill Company, now playing in San.

appearance will be next Monday, when he
will be cast In "Phroso." Later he will
be seen in "The Colonial Girl." His ulti

the stage in Paris and other capitals and
centers of dramatic art in Europe.
During his four years at the university
Mr. Southard developed remarkable nat

that direction during his college career
gave him much prominence. While his
bent was toward the stage his friends are
much surprised that he should have de
termined to use his abilities to shine in a
professional way. They predict much suc

even more candidates than the Knights.
Allended happily,- however, and the prin
cipal officers for the ensuing term are:
Grand chief, Lillie Samuels of Oakland;
grand senior, Mrs. E, S. Prlngle of Santa
Cruz;. grand junior, Maud Sheehan of Sac
ramento; grand manager, Aim Wyatt of
Salines; grand protector, Mrs. Clara Mar
tin of Stockton.
The session, opened . promptly at 9
o'clock. Grand Vice Chancellor Calkins
presided in the absence of Grand Chancel
lor Jeter, who was granted leave of ab
sence for twenty-four hours. Grand Vice
Chancellor Calkins added zest to the open
ing proceedings by having the members
join in the ritualistic ode of the subor
dinate lodges. As many of the represent
atives are good singers the occasion was
inspiring. . " .
After rollcall George Samuels of Oak
land exemplified the unwritten work in ft
comprehensive manner. The matter of the
Supreme Lodge and Supreme Assembly in
San Francisco in 1902 was discussed. The
per capita tax of 75 cents was continued
by resolution. There is $9000 in prizes to
be distributed next year in competitive
drills, and the crack teams from all over
the United States will compete. A reso-'
lution was Introduced that a committee of
three be appointed to submit a memorial
to the sub-lodges, containing the proposi
tion for building a Pythian Home, the
matter to be settled at the next session of
the Grand Lodge. The grand chancellor
appointed P. C. Nyland, G. M. E. Little
and G. G. C. Lindsay.
The work of the Rathbone Sisters at
Pythian Castle other than the election
was r of a routine nature. A feature of the
session was the presentation of beautiful
flowers to the temple by the ladies of the
First Christian Church. The flowers were
in turn presented by the temple to Su
preme Mistress of Records and Corre
spondence Josie A. Nelson of Indiana.
The grand ball to be given- â¢ to-morro-w
night will take place at the Masonic Hall.
CONSTITUTION DOES

Beports From Washington- Announcs
That United States Supreme ')
Court Will So Decide.
CHICAGO, May 23.â The Record-Herald
prints to-day from its Washington Bureau
an article to the effect . tRat- the decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States
will be that the constitution does not fol
low the flag. The article goes on: "This
decision, the most important that the
great tribunal has ever made, will be
handed down next Monday. The-only ele
ment of doubt as to the appearance of the
judgment on that day lies in the fact that
one or two of the Justices may not have
their opinions finished and that out of
courtesy to them it will be necessary to
have further delay."

THE PRESIDENT IN SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA: Depicted in the "Wasp's
Presidential souvenir number. Sixty pages
of reception pictures. 25 cents. â¢
.which, has for two days listened _to the
evidence in the case of Mrs. Emma Lucy
Judd,. wife of one of the. officials of John
Alexander Dowie's Zion, to-night returned
a verdict holding Dowie, H. W. Judd,
husband of the woman, and Mrs. Sprecher
and Mrs. Bratsch to await the action of
the Grand Jury. The two women named
in- the verdict were in attendance upon
Mrs. Judd prior to her death. The charge
against them is "criminal- responsibility"
for the death of Mrs. Judd.
The evidence, given at the inquest. by
some of the leading . physicians of the
city, who had examined Mrs. Judd's body
after it had been ' exhumed, . was to the
effect that the most simple surgical care
would have prevented' the woman's death,
which resulted from the rupture of a
blood vessel. They testified that. she was
allowed. to die when the slightest attempt
to save her- life would have been success
ful. This evidence induced the jury, to
declare that the people -named were re
sponsible for the woman's death...
Papers were at once made out and of-,
fleers sent to arrest Dowie, Judd. and the
two women. "When the officers arrived at
Zlon - Dowie was not to be found. Mrs.
Bratsch was arrested in the building and
was â¢ promptly sent Â¦ to the County Jail,
but H. \V. Judd and Mrs. Sprecher were
no more in evidence than was Dowie. It
was announced by the police that the
search would be kept up until the missing
three people were taken into custody. It
was the opinion of the officers that Dowie
had gone into hiding for the night, know
ing that he would hardly be able to fur
nish bonds in time to prevent. a night. in
jail. If not found during the nighf it is
expected that he will appear in the morn
ing prepared to give bail for himself and
three companions. . ~
A mob of 1000 people paraded through
the streets of South Chicago - to-night,
carrying an effigy of Dowie, which was
finally deposited in a large bonfire. About
three weeks ago Mrs. Christenson, one of
the Dowie followers, was burned in escap
ing from her burning dwelling house. She,
refused the aid of physicians and died
within a week. The courts took from her
and her husband the custody of a little
daughter, who had been severely burned.
The girl is now practically recovered.
There has been much feeling against
Dowie in South Chicago since the death of
Mrs." Christensen.

School and Van Ness Seminary in aid of
the Boys' Club of the San Francisco Set
tlement Association. The commodious
gymnasium of the school, at 1849 Jackson
street, was crowded to its utmost capac
ity by an appreciative audience. A play
in three acts entitled "An Old Story Re
told" was presented, and scored an- artis
tic success. It was written and directed
by Miss Maud Marion Taylor. The play
was founded upon incidents preceding the
Trojan war and was based on Professor
Charles M. Gayley's rendering of the
Greek myths in his "Classic Myths." The
judgment scene was adapted from Tenny
son's "Oenone," Original music, written
for the play by Miss Marie L. Weldon,
was rendered by Mrs. Grace Morei Dick
man, the well-known contralto, and Miss
Constance Jordan, accompanist.
Miss Taylor displayed great literary
ability In putting her difficult play togeth
er. The roles were taken by the pupils
of the school and the young ladies dis
played histrionic ability. Their efforts
were amply rewarded with flowers and
enthusiastic applause. They were attired
in Grecian gowns and presented a charm
ing picture. The entertainment was so
successful that it will -probably be given
again at some future day. Following were
the characters in the play:

GREEK PLAY
TO AID BOYS' CLUB
The country home of the tittle Sisters'
Infant Shelter was opened Wednesday
and there was heard the delighted ex
Â»-:amations of the first seven < children
: ruught over from the city to spend a
week, in Mill Valley. They were brought
â¢ uer Wednesday morning by Miss Daisy
Hums, president of the Ladies' Auxiliary
of the organization, and in an hour they
.iad become settled and contented and
prepared to make the most of their time.
me Infants' Shelter is a home for the
children of working parents, and its ob
ject is to care for the little ones while
ineir mothers are away earning enouch
io keep soul and body together. There
are fcfty or more children in the shelter,
some being oared for from month to
month, others being brought in the morn
iujj and taken home each night. They are
veil cared for in the home, but the ladies
of the auxiliary have conceived the plan
of establishing a place in the country,
v.nere the little ones could be taken dur
ing the summer, just as is done In New
York, where the plan has been so suc
cessful as to attract national attention.
A cottage in Mill Valley was secured, a
small one, for the funds of the auxiliary
aie not unlimited, and a matron and her
daughter were installed to care for the
cbilcren as they tvere sent over. The
larder was stocked with the best obtain
able, most of it being the generous gift
of merchants, who saw in the scheme a
worthy cause, and some email concessions
were made by the railroad. Then every
thing was ready and the first installment
<>f children was brought over and turned
loose on the hillsides overlooking the town
of Mill Valley. The place Is but ten min
utes" walk from the station and is big 1
enough for any number of children, but
ihe c-apacity of the cottage is limited, so
the tine had to be cut down in order that
all the children of the home could be
gives g few days out in the country air.
The rent of the cottage for the three
months it will be used by the auxiliary
was paid by some unknown friend of the
organization. There are other expenses,
however, that are being met as best the
ladies can, but they hope that, with the
aid of friends, they will Install the idea
as one of the regular summer works of
charity that the city can give to those
who need it most.
The officers of the Ladies' Auxiliary are:
Mips Daisy Burns of 1506 Washington
street, president; Miss Mabel Wheaton of
2S10 Washington street, secretary, and
Miss May Billings of Mill Valley," treas
urer. The home is at 512 Minna street.

Commissioners Declared
Not to Have Juiv

Supreme Court Decision Is
, Against the Citizens
of Fresno.
. â ? â | â
The people of Fresno lost their rate case
yesterday in the Supreme Court,. a deci
sion being handed dawn in favor of the
defendant, the Southern Pacific Company.
The- decision . handed down says .that
Judge Bahrserred in granting the prayer,
of the Fresno people, which was that the
Southern Pacific Company, had â¢ no right
to change the price of passenger transpor
tation ; between here and Fresno without
the consent of the Railroad Commlssion
i et3 -' 'Â¦-- ' â¢'--.'Â¦;' Â¦Â¦ Â¦ -
The. cause of the present suit arose In.
May, 1900. The Santa Fe Railway the mo
ment that it began operating between
here and Fresno cut the fare between
these two points to |3 75. The Southern
Pacific Company, which - had previously
charged $5 SO, met the cut and made the
same low: rate; Soon afterward a com
promise Was made between the two roads
and the Southern Pacific Company re
sumed its old rate. This raised a great
deal of discontent among the residents of
Fresno and they appealed to the Railroad
Commissioners. That body took the mat
ter in hand and decided that the Southern
Pacific Company had no right to raise the
price of transportation in this State with
out first consulting it. The railroad com
pany replied that the special rate of ?3 73
was an "excursion rate" and that it was
not raising the price of transportation.
The case was taken to the Superior
Court by the Railroad Commissioners and
was entitled "E. B: Edson, the Railroad
Commissioners vs. The Southern Pacific
Company." Judge Bahrs rendered a deci
sion i;i favor of the Railroal Commis
sioners and the case was then taken to
the Supreme Court. - . - Â¦ Â¦
In its decision the Supreme" Court says:
Â¦ It is a matter of hlstcry that section 20 was
adopted by the convention before It was agreed
to create the commission, subsequently estab
lished by section 22--a fact strongly emphasized
by the. language of the latter part of section
20, Tviiere, instead of naming the Railroad Com
mission, resort Is . had to the awkward phara
phrase above quoted, '-the governmental au
thority In which shall be vested the power to
regulate freights and fares." . Â¦ ... -.
'When the section was adopted it was .'under
stood that the power to regulate freights and
fares might be, left, along with the -mass of
legislative powers, to trie Senate and Assembly
and, of course, It was not then supposed that
any infraction of it3 provisions would be real
ized otherwise than through the medium of
appropriate proceedings In the courts. The
subsequent adoption of section 22 required no
change in this respect, and none seems to have
been Intended. r .' -
The Superior Court therefore erred In treating
the findings and order of - the Railroad Com
mission as final and conclusive adjudication
against the defendant, and In basing its de
crees upon the pleadings alone without proof
of the facts alleged In the first count of the
complaint. ' .
As this error of the Superior Court necessl- '
tates a reversal of the judgment, it is unneces
sary, and, as we think, undesirable, that we I
should at this .time undertake to decide the
constitutional questions which lhave been so
elaborately . argued in the briefs. , i
.The opinion is written by Beatty and
concurred in by Henshaw; McFarland,
Temple, Van Dyke and Garoutte.
The ' case now reverts â¢ back to the Su
perior Court, and what line of attack the
Railroad Commissioners will take, has
not yet been decided upon by Ihem. *

NEW MERCHANTS'
EXCHANGE BORN
Directors Are Selected
to Erect Immense
Buildino-
... / - â¢ Â¦Â¦'Â¦'Â¦ ' - ? â :
Institution Incorporated to
Aid Commercial Co-* /"^
operation.
- The new Merchants' Exchange of San
Francisco; came into existence yesterday
by the election of .the first board: of ; di
rectors and " the approval i of articles^ of
incorporation! One of the first results" of
the new organization will be the erection
of , a splendid structure eight to ten sto
ries high on the site of the present build
ing of the oldf Merchants' Exchange on
California street, for the purpose of hous
ing all the commercial . organizations of
the city that desire to avail "themselves
of the opportunity held out to them.
The directors selected represent all the
leading commercial and financial Inter
ests of the city, being as follows: - .
Henry F. Allen, merchants; "William Babcock.
shipping; Thomas Brown, banks; Andrew Car
rigan, hardware and metals; B. Faymonville,
insurance; E. W. Hopkins, capitalist; L. Kauff
man, grain; George Â¦ AV. Â¦ McNear, grain; Leon
Sloss, transportation; Claus Spreckels, capital
ists; H. C. Somers, hay;'R. P. Schwerln, trans
portation; F. W. Van Sicklen, groceries and
provisions; William H. Talbot. lumber; F. W.
Zelle, banking.
The General Plan..
The work of getting general consent to
the establishment of the ; new exchange
has been progressing for some "time .and
, has been principajly . conducted by Secre
tary T. Cary Friedlander, of the San
Francisco Produce Exchange, which or
ganization owns a- majority of the fetock
controlling the California street property.
For a time success was doubtful. Now
the San Francisco Produce Exchange
and also the old Merchants' Exchange
Association will be sold out and will dis
appear. In their' places will be the new
organization. The articles of . incorpora
tion make the duration of the association
fifty years and set forth the purposes to
be the establishment and maintenance of
a commercial exchange in San Francisco;
to acquire property .and to erect a suit
able building for the purposes of the ex
change; to establish and maintain uni
formity in commercial usages; to acquire!
preserve and disseminate valuable busi
ness information, and to adjust ' contro
versies' and misunderstandings between
the members; also to secure to members
the benefits of co-operation In the fur
therance of .their legitimate" pursuits.--^
â¢ The corporation- has no capital stock or
shares. : The holding of property is limit
ed to enough for the purposes of incor
poration. The officers provided for. are a
president, vice president, treasurer and
secretary. The control of the property is
vested in a board of ' fifteen directors.
The president and vice president will be
elected by i the board of directors. The
directors will have power to levy assess
ments upon the members and will have
charge and control of the property of
the exchange. '
, ToCentsr Business. .
In a general way the purposes of the
exchange mav be defined to embrace the
enrollment- of merchants, > of tho3e en
gaged Â¦ in the city - in ' shipping, in the
handling of grain, hay and produce, in
the coal "and lumber trades ; also banks,
insurance companies, real estate agencies,
and the financial institutions of the city.
There are institutions In the East upon
which the Merchants' Exchange of San
Francisco is modeled.
The Chamber . of : Commerce, the San
Francisco Board of Trade, the Merchants'
Association, the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association : and various ex
changes that are now scattered through
out Â¦ the business section of the ' city, .may
be centralized in the new building when
it is constructed. -There will be assembly
halls and the exchanges and . associations
will also have their separate quarters 'for
the transaction .of their business. No
plans have been made for the new build
ing. It Will be modern in every way.
As soon as possible the old building,
which. has so. long been a landmark on
California ; street, will be demolished to
give way to something equal to. all de
mands that may be made for many years.

Â¦ THE TIVOLI, WHILE THE OTHER IS .TO APPEAR ON MONDAY '
. NEXT AT THE GRAND OPERA-HOUSE IN "CLEOPATRA."
THE Toymaker," the charming
operetta holding the boards at the
Tivoli, has made a tremendous
hit at this popular house and has
given the Tivoli prlma donna.
Miss Annie Myers, the opportunity * to
make the hit of her stage career â an op
portunity the charming little lady has
availed h.erself of completely. As Elsa,
the toymaker's daughter, who pretends to
be the wonderful automaton doll that her
father's genius has created and her clum
siness has destroyed, Miss Myers does
some splendid work that stamps .her not
only as a singer but as an actress of un
usual ability. Especially is this tho case
in the last scene, where Frederick (Ed
ward Webb) discovers that she is not a
doll, but a real live woman, a scene that
wins for the talented little lady nightly
many recalls.
"The Toymaker" has given to Miss
Myers stellar honors. , Â¦
Melbourne MacDowell, who is to appear
with the Morosco stock company next
week, is said to receive the magnificent
salary of $1000 a week. This is to be the
first engagement of MacDowell in which
he will not be featured as the entire show
and where his name will be printed in the
same type as those of the other members
of the supporting company. During Mac-
Dowell s stay at the Grand he will appear
in the plays that won for him fame and
fortune when <he was co-star with his
wife, the late Fanny Davenport.
Tho opening play of the MacDowell sea
son Is to be "Cleopatra." and the Morosco
management promises to give it the same
gorgeous mounting and careful attention
to detail as it received at the hands of
Davenport.

The Supervisors* Finance Committee
submlted to the local board last night its
estimate of the necessary expenditures of
the municipal government for, the next
fiscal year, which it places at $5,470,100.
This sum is the same as that estimated by
Auditor Wells, but the figures for the va
rious departments have been chnnged in
a number of- instances. To raise this
amount the committee figures that a tax
! rate of $1 on every $100 assessed valuation
will be reauired on a valuation of $400.

come from licenses and other sources.

A GAY OUTING
; The Supremo â¢ Court handed down a de
cision yesterday i which establishes the
precedent, that banking Institutions can
be i assessed and- compelled to pay tho
taxes "on money; which Is, owed* to them
from without the State, provided that It
constitute a "solvent credit."
The. Pacific Coast. Savings Society,
against which the decision was rendered,
transacts a building and loan business In
San Francisco; 1 . and ls.corinected with the
New York firm of J. & W. Seligman.
with whom in the | course of commercial
operations it frequently has : a large
amount of money.
Prior to March '1, 1896, : the local Savings
Society had $100,000 with â¢ the New Tork
firm, resulting from the sale of. bonds in
London. At the, time the local Assessor
requested a statement of personal prop
erty from the Savings Society, which oc
curred - shortly after this sale, there re
mained, but $65,000 of the original sum on
deposit and , no return .was made of this.
The Assessor later discovered this error
and requested additional' taxes.' This was
refused and the -taxes were finally paid
under protest. â¢: . " '_
Legal, proceedings, were, instituted and
the Superior : Court f upheld the â¢ Assessor
in his action. Appeal . was : made to the
Supreme Court.. and yesterday an opinion
affirming the' judgment and, order of the
lower court was filed. ' . .Â¦ "~.*<^\- ~
"The following statements appear In tho
decision: ,
The relation between a general depositor of
money . with . a . bank and that * bank is that ' of
debtor ' and creditor.? â¢ â¢ â¢ The general . rule
,1s that debts attend the person of the creditor
and are taxable at his domicile. 1 . ? â¢ â¢:â¢ It was
Â¦therefore assessed ; as solvent credit and aa
property In San j Francisco, belonging to It on
that; day. 'Â¦ â¢ Â¦ . ~ _.
The <' decision . was 'â¢> rendered by Justice
Harrison, Â¦* with .. whom Justices Garoutte
and Van Dyke concurred. ,'.;Â¦'. 'Â¦

SUPREME COURT
SUSTAINS CITY
On account of Fltzhugh's protracted
stay here it was whispered that Krutt
schnut would have to go, 1 but su<tfi Is not
the case.
Rumor* to the effect that General Man
ager Julius Kruttschnltt of the Southern
Pacific Company In , about to bo called
upon by President Charles M. Hays to re
sign are erroneous. Mr. Kruttschnltt is
on the most friendly terms with the new
president, and, what is still better, Hays
has more thon once expressed himself as
highly pleased with his management and
executive ability.
Where the rumor started is hard to find
out. Kruttschnitt, like other public men,
has many enemies, who think, no doubt,
that by circulating a report of -this kind
they can be instrumental in "securing his
discharge. But those who are . practical
railroad men know that Kruttschnltt Is a
valuable' man to the company. Besides
being a good operating official he is also
an educated man, who can compile' sta-'
tlstlcs showing the workings of the road
at a glance. He is also a thorough rail
road engineer. His services are most val
uable when construction work is being
done. â¢ . â¢â¢."â¢â¢
Rumors That His Head
Is in Danger Are .
False.
