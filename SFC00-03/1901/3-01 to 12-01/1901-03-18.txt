Burial ol Benjamin Harrison
Wiffi Honor Befitting
His Memory.
. â¢ a/x-
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. March 17.â Tn
the center of a hollow square composed of
fully 15,000 of his fellow citizens the re
mains of Benjamin Harrison were this
afternoon Interred In the family lot in
Crown Hill Cemetery- Close by the grave
were the members of his family. Presi
dent McKlnley and other visitors o#-*vdis
tlnctlon and the more Intimate frle^ oÂ£
treneral Harrison. Back a distance oi
fifty yards, behind ropes guarded zealous
ly by a large force of police, stood with
uncovered heads the great multitude who
knew him not so well as did they wt?o
stood beside the freshly-upturned earth,
but who honored him and admired him
fully as much. It Is doubtful If any pub
lic man. at least In this generation, was
borne to his last resting place among so
many manifestations of respect. The'e
was no exception anywhere to the ex
pression that the nation had lost one of
of its ablest men and the greatest man
of his generation In his own State.
By the grave stood the chief magistrate
of the nation, and behind the ropes were
all the street arabs of General Harri
son's cityâ every grade of human life In
America, between the two. was repre
sented In the crowd, and In them all there
was but the one feeling â that a man had
died who was. honest at all times with
himself and with others, and whose ability
and character were such as the nation
could ill afford to lose.
The weather, like that of yesterday,
was unsurpassable, with bright sunlight,
the warm breath of spring In every
breeze, and yet in the air a touch of win-
ter that brought the blood to the cheek
and. a sparkle to the eye.
The services a^ the church and grave
werÂ». simple In the extreme, all .In most
excellent taste, and. like the proceedln-r*
yesterday, * there was an utter absence of
friction In everything 1 that was done. All
was well ordered and well performed.
Arrival of President.
At the Harrison home â¢ before the re
mains were taken to the First Presby
terian Church, where the full funeral ser
vice was held, there were brief exercises
for the members of the family and more
Intimate friends of General Harrison. Po*-
sibly 130 people were present. Mrs. Harri
son did not appear, but remained In her
room until it was time to leave for the
.church.
President McKlnley, accompanied P.r
Governor Durbln, called at the houso
about 1 o'clock. At about the same tlmo
came the members of President Harri
son's Cabinet, and others continually ar
rived until the short services were over.
Dr. Haines read a short passage from th-->
Scriptures and made a few remarks
touching the life and character of Gen
eral Harrison, as did Dr. Nichols of St.
Louis, and after a brief prayer by Dr.
Haines the services were over.
The Funeral Procession.
The funeral procession was to have left
the house at 1:30 o'clock, but it was fully
thirty minutes later than that when ev
erything was In readiness. The doors
were thrown wide o5*n, and the honor
ary pallbearers, who were General Ben
jamin F. Tracey of New York. John Wan
amaker of Philadelphia. W. H. H. Miller
of Indianapolis. John W. Noble of' St.
Louis arid Charles Foster of Fostoria.
Ohio; General Lew Wallace of Indianap
olis. Judson Harmon of Cincinnati anl
William A. Woods of Indianapolis, came
slowly down the walk leading to the
street. After them came the active pall
bearers, bearing the casket. They were:
A. L. Mason, James Whitcomb Rlley.
Evans Wooten, Harry J. Mllligan. Clif
ford Arrick, William C. Bobbs. H. S.
New. Howard Cale. John T. Griffith-.
Newton Booth Tarklngton. Hilton U.
Brown and Samuel Reid.
While the casket was being placed In
the hearse the honorary pallbearers stood
to one side- with bared heads. As soon An
the hearse had moved 'from the front of
the house the carriages came up rapidly,
and the family and visitors entered them.
Behind the casket came Mrs. Harrison,
with her brother, Lieutenant Commander
Parker of the navy, and llttie Elizabetn
Harrison. Then came Secretary TIbbÂ«tt
and Mrs. Tibbett, then Mr. and Mrs. Mc-
Kee, Russell Harrison and Mrs. Russell
Harrison, then the other relatives or the
dead ex-President. Directly after ,Â«M
members of the family came President
McKlnley and Governor Durbln. and. fo%
lowing them, the friends of the farai'y.
Twelve mounted policemen led the way
and cleared the streets.
Thousands Are Gathered.*
There were several thousand people
around the Harrison residence as the
funeral procession moved away, but the
crowd there was Insignificant to that
which was gathered around the church.
Two hours before the time set for the
commencement of the services the people
had begun to gather at this point, and by
the time the funeral procession arrived
there was a *olid mass of humanity
stretching a block away on every side of
the walk.
While the carriages were discharging
their inmates at the door of the church

BERLIN, March 17.â The Lokal An

Germany will soon discharge many labor
ers, being compelled to take this course
by the Increased cost of production due
to the high price of coal. According to

The North German Lloyd line has re

LONDON, March IS. â One of the Her
reshoff family, who Is now in Glasgow,
on Saturday allowed himself to be inter
viewed for the Dally Mail. After giving
some particulars of the new America's
cup defender, he expressed an 'opinion
regarding Shamrock II, which he had
seen at Messrs. Denny's- yard, at Dum
barton.
He said the present challenger, like the
Columbia in 1S39. will have a bronze bot
tom and steel top sides, and will be very
much like that boat In appearance. The
fact that she was designed by Mr. Wat
son goes to prove that she will be a good
representative of the type of boat which
Great Britain can produce.
"The taking of the British boat across
thÂ« ocean has been thought by some to
favor America, but at the present time,",
says' Mr. Herreshoff's Interviewer, "the
best authorities consider this not to be
the case. When a boat under a Jury riff
Is eased In a sea she has not one-half
the strain on her that she would be sub
ject to when under racing Balls and
forced through all kinds of sea."

with regard to the terms of the amend

whether it is final and m the nature of an

have been made by'th; Military Governor
regarding its finaMty. Some members of
the convention are i:?pcsed to submit
proposals substantially modifying the
terms of the amendment if it is rot abso

The genera! ceatfcneat of the Committee

PEKING, _*arch 17.â The health of LI
Hung Chang Is again a matter of grave
consideration to the Ministers of the
powers. Mr. Rockhill, the American spe

yesterday, says he is a physical wreck
and apparently In a state of utter collapse
although mentally as bright as ever. Mr.
Rockhill would not be surprised to hear
of his death any moment.
The removal of Li Hung Chang by death
or any other cause at the present moment
would be very unfortunate. M. de Glers.
the Russian Minister, said to-day:
"Li Hung Chang Is a great diplomat,
and his influence with the Chinese court
Is absolutely unique. No other man In
ChinrÂ» ayproaches him In this respect.
This influence is not temporary, but it is
particularly effective at important mo
ments like the present In the history of
Cuina."
Senor ' de Colonogan, Spanish Minister
and Royan of the diplomatic corps, said:
"The Chinese court could not appoint a
plenipotentiary of the same caliber and
having eaual influence with the Chinese
and the foreigners. Although many of
the Ministers of the powers object to his
political methods and regard him as es
sentially a trimmer, nevertheless they
realize that he is the best possible man to

troops In the country for at least two
years. Most of the officers take a different
view of the matter, believing that the best

EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION.
Financial Way.
State University Well Cared For in a
The State University has fared well
financially, but the support comes mainly
ln~"the form of special appropriations, a
plan which has never found favor in the
eyes of the friends of the institution. At;
the beginning of' the . session . there were
several bills to provide new taxes. to swell
â¢the university fund. One was a tax on
direct inheritances. Another was a tax
"n naturalization, and a third was a grad
uated-tax on incorporations. It soon be
came known, however, t that 'these bills
would never pass tho Governor^ so there
was much conferring and "caucusing, and
finally all wore abandoned for a bill ap
propriating" $200,000 straight, another ap
propriating $50,000, which might be used
if necessary to pay any deficiency In the
endowment caused by losses in the Turner
mortgage, and a third, bill declaring thÂ«
Institution a permanent charge In the gen
eral appropriation bill. The Governor
wished to add the $48,000. remaining in the
fund for the Governor's mansion fund, but
after a ''wall from Â¦ Sacramento this Idea
was abandoned. Tiie bill putting the uni
versity into the general appropriation bill
to the extent of $100,000 Â¦ a Â¦ year was ob
jected to as an-effort to bind future Legis
latures, and it was amended so as to be a
declaration of the policy of this Legisla
ture. Then all the bills went 7 through
and all have been signed. 1 ', .The bill pro
viding for a tax on incorporations was re
vived as a feeder for the general' fund of
the State. Â¦-â¢â¢ Â¦ . Â¦â¢ - . -Â¦ . . :
Stanford University got all it asked. \ It
was allowed . ftill corporate privileges,
which will allow it tc accept and hold tho
Stanford lands and dollars, Its bonds were
exemptedvfrom- taxation and its College
buildings, and equipment, as. well. .* ;.. -â¢
The;mQst important; of the educational
bills .passed is -the committee, substitute
for Senate bill 603-the text-book measure.
It creates the. Text-book Commission, to
consist of -the Superintendent of -Public
Instruction and .the -, State Printer, and
gives the commission various powers, sub
ject.to tbe approval of the State Board of
Education. The most important Innova
tion embodied In the bill is the authority,
to purchase copyrights or plates of text
books from Eastern publishers."
The general certification bill, prepared
by the Calif ornla - Educational Commis
sion, passed the Assembly as Assembly
bill 706, by Dunlap.- All existing teachers'
certificate . are protected and provisions
are made for their renewal. Primary
grade certificates are â¢ abolished, making
it necessary for. air teachers to be able to
.pass the examination for grammar grade
.certificates. By way of compensation,' a
grammar grade certlflcate Is to be recog

ceives 5100,000 for a building. The Los
Angeles Normal School was given $10,000
for Improvements, but the Governor has
vetoed the bill. The San Diego Normal
School asked for a $30,000 appropriation,
but the bill was withdrawn upon recom
mendation. A j"5,000 appropriation for the
Chico Normal has gone to the Governor,
and an Assembly bill appropriating $55,000
for the San Jose Normal is also in the
hands of the Governor.
The California Educational Commis

proval.
The two most important forestry meas
ures passed were the Sempervirens Club
bill appropriating $250,000 for the purchase
of the magnificent redwood forest 1 of the
Big Basin tract, in Santa Cruz County,
and its maintenance as a State park, and
the "water and forestry" bill, appropriat
ing $107,000 for the investigation of the
State's water resources and the best meth
ods for the preservation of our forests,'
to be conducted under the supervision of
the United Stales Geological Survey, by
which a like sum will be expended. The
Big Basin purchase bill has been signed
and the other has been vetoed,' as the
Governor did not want to pass two such
largo appropriations on similar subjects.
DIVORCES REVOLUTIONIZED.
Governor Gage.
Sheridan's Bill Now in the Hands of
The Sheridan divorce bill will revolu
tionize divorces In this State ifjt meets
with the approval of the â¢ Governor, j In
whose hands it now Is. 'It provides for an
interlocutory decree upon the hearing of
the evidence in the suit, the decree to.be
final as to the existence. of a ground for
divorce, alimony, property division and
custody of; children. At the end of six
months, if the decree has not been re
versed on appeal or a new trial granted, a
final decree is issued dissolving the bonds
of matrimony. Either party has then the
status of a single person and may marry
again. By implication the act repeals the
act prohibiting remarriage within a year
after divorce. Fisk's blir specifically re
pealing the latter act was defeated In the
Senate. Â¦ - ; "., â¢ . .

vorce laws of the various States by pro
hibiting divorces v on causes which were

tt and has kept it ever since.
Many bills relating' to public morals
were Introduced and most of them died in
committee'- or on file or were defeated on
the floor.of one house or the other. Such
was the fate of the antl-poolselling bills,'
Ashe's bill restricting racing to forty days
in the year, the local option bills and the
anti-cigarette- bills. Knowland's Chinese
slavery bills passed both houses without
opposition. One makes a felony of holding
a person in bondage, and the other pro
vided for . the temporary " guardianship of
minors-^-an . attempt to facilitate the res
cue of Chinese slave girls. The guardian
ship, bill was .vetoed,, while the other was

rigorous punishment . of -crimes against

RAILROAD IS WELL TREATED.
Four of Its Pet Schemes Enacted by
the Lawmakers.
â¢ The railroad' has hardly missed a. .trick
this session. It had Innumerable small
bills, Jaut, It had^ourbie ones, till of -which
went through. ;One off these was' the
street-railway franchise* bill;, a second
was amendment 2S; a third was a bill
giving the Governor the right to make po
lice out of the train hands and railroad
employes, and a fourth, and. by far tha
most Important of all, was a bill to pro
vide for the consolidation of railroad
companies in this State.- The last two are
In the Governor's hands.
Just what the possibilities of the con
solidation bill are is (something only time
can prove. It allows railroads to come
together and for each to acquire all tho
rights and privileges, franchises, proper
ty, stock and rights of way of the othor.
Tne other measure is ostensibly to allow
railroad employes police powers on tho
company's property, so as better to pro
tect passengers; but, as Davis pointed out
on the floor of the Senate, in time of
strikes every employe could be made a
policeman, and every striker who dUi
his bidding would be adding "resisting an
officer in the discharge of his duty" to"
his other troubles. There was an attempt
to pass a bill providing .that delinquent
tax titles could not be acquired â¢ by the
State when the land taxed was in tho
name of the United States, . a measure
which woul'd allow, the railroad to retain
thousands of acres upon which it ' paid
no taxes during the years "in which, it
was acquiring title to it from' the Federal
Government. The bill .was beaten in the
?. jnate after a hard parliamentary fight.
The banking laws were not touched 10
any great . exteat. A bill to allow the
stockholders of an insolvent bank to elect
a receiver passed both houses and Is now
with the Governor. There was also a
bill to abolish the Bank Commission, but
that was defeated early In the session.
In insurance the only bill of -real im
portance was that providing for the pay
ment of the face values of l ollcles in case
of total loss by fire. This was amended to
make such payment contingent upon
agreement between insurer and insured.
The Governor now has the bill. '
Legislation affecting the courts . was
confined mostly to the county govern
ment bill, which fixed Judges' salaries, to
bills relating to the Supremo Court and
to constitutional amendments providing
courts of appeal. The idea of intermediate
courts of appeal found but little., favor,
for committees in both houses fiddled
over amendments until late in the, sea
sion, and then one constitutional amend
ment was sent into each houes. They
were- both practically, the old -idea of
three courts of appeal of : three : Judges
each, and each to have Jurisdiction over j*
district.- -The Assembly amendment went
forward the- quicker, and met defeat- ' IiÂ»
the Senate.- . , . :
The well-known bill to Tcnock out . th.v
Supreme 'Court -Commission -~ came Â¦ up
again., and. was defeated. A measure . t-j
increase the Judges of the Supreme Couit
to ten, 'with three 'departments, was also
passed up to third readine. . where it
remained. The .-ea was that the ten
Judges could clear up the calendar,' anj
then. In two or four years, three of them
could be dropped. There were also a
number of little bills regarding procedure,
and a bill by Ashe. regarding the feesof
Public Administrators, was passed , with
much effort through the Senate,-; but Â¦ it

affecting; municipalities.
Several j Important Measures Placed.
Upon the Statutes.
The law of municipal corporations . .has
Â¦received a" good deal of attention, ' mostly
from -Taylor of Alameda, and some "'new
and ; valuable legislation; is the result;.-: A
bill to : provide ;a ' hew. method of _\ street
assessment has been signed by' the'Gov
ernor. Â¦ It; provides that -the -. assessment
may be collected in ; advance, Â¦ bo = that
when the bids are "made the money is
waiting, and extra charge for risk of non
payments is , not-, figured.- into the bids by
the contractors.- The bill provides,- also,
that if the assessment cannot be collected
at once it may 'be- paid In Installments
repchJng; over not more than i ten Â¦ years.

Another -tilll, also signed by- the Gov
ernor, allows the .'Esuance of -? municipal
bonds . for: forty ; years or- less,- Instead -of

the' law. and simplifies the procedure rand

Another important measure, which be-

ff^ RAMENTO. March 17.â Starting
a bravely. Â¦ with a Republican ma
h. jority sweeping and overpower
v %^^ ing, and free from the entangle-
ments of a Senatorial contest.
the ' thirty-fourth - session of ,
thÂ« Legislature has Closed -oh . two
months of the driest, ' most monoton
ous, molt profitless legislation , the
State has Been. It has been an eminently
respectable Legislature, and Its members
are going: home with clean* hands and
pockets honestly empty. Occasionally the
chink cf the lobby coin has been heard,
bui it has not been loud and it has not
often come upon the floor. Bills were not
r.cmerous, a greater percentage than
usual were unimportant and no one
worked hard except the presiding officers
and the secretaries.
The session started, too. with the best
intentions. There would be barrelfuls of
bills was the prediction, for there were no
Senatorial complications and the net re
sult of the session would be pure legisla
tion. But it seems that Senatorial pro
grammes must be good things on which to
hang measures, for the bâ Is this year
have fallen far *elow the record of two
years ago, when nothing was thought of,
apparently, but who suould sit in the
VrAted States Senate.
There were five things this Legislature
had to do besides junket and draw pay.
It had to pass a primary. law; to decide
upon a system of apportionment In con
formity with the last census and to pro
vide a district for the new Congressman
allowed the State; to pass a county gov
ernment act to adjust salaries which had
not been adjusted for four years at least;
to receeive the report of the Code Com
mission, consider it and revise the codes
in pursuance of the report and such
amendments as might be made to it, and
to pass a general appropriation bill. All
of these things it has done, and it has
worked but two Saturdays and but ten
days' overtime. But beyond these five
pieces of legislation it has done practically
nothing of importance.
It ratified the China . Basin lease; it
passed a constitutional amendment pro
viding for a State commission with wide
powers of fixing rates and charges cf
quaFl-public corporations and common
carriers; it overturned the State Printing
Office and made the Superintendent ap
pointive instead of elective; it Allowed a
new Polytechnic School to San Luis
Obispo County: it passed bills to protect
the State against disease: it passed a fran
chise bill that gave it a good fight in
each house: It tried to patch up the morals
of the State a little and it showed a strong
inclination to kill cinch bills and let their
counterparts In railroad measures go
through, and it did a good many more lit
tle things and dodged several more, big
and little. So It was not wholly without
result, but it was not a great Legislature,
nor did It 'make any history to speak of.
NEW PBIMAEY REGULATIONS.
Every of the Supreme Court
Has Been Met.
The primary law finally passed was a
pubstltute for a number of bills submitted
by various Senators and Assemblymen
and gathered from various sources and
considered in joint cessions of the # Elec
tions Committees of both houses.' 'There
were no fewer than seven primary laws
FUbmitted and thesÂ» were boiled down
into one. Then anything that did not re
late directly to a primary law was elim
inated- from the bill and that was molded
fo as to meet every objection the Supreme
Court has ever made to such legislation.
The "bill provides that primaries for all
parties and all conventions shall be held
on the same date anl in the same booths;
that each man voting shall be given a bal
lot pnnted for the party with, which he
wishes to vote, and which, he fiiu.n jnaTl:
with the names of his party's delegates;
that the primary clectlnn officers shall be
paid and that the "it-ft" shall be the sim
ple affirmation that the Voter is voting at'
the primary with the party he will sup
port at the next' general election. ! The
Assembly enlarged this test-Hran oath
that the voter supported 'the principles
set forth "In his party's last platform as
well, but the Senate refused. â¢ the'amend
ment and tbe bill went through w}th- the
more simple ' test. â¢ '
The-apportionment- problem promised all
sorts of puzzles .from. the. first, and even
now the echoes of the last wrangle in
caucus have hardly died away. It took
conference after caucus and caucus after
oonference to settle the Congressional
lines, and 'ttien^- thwo was more trouble
over the lines of lasser districts, but it
has finally been put through on a scheme
gn&ranteed to return Republicans ! f roiri
<"aeh Congressional district, nearly all the
Senatorial districts and most of the As
sembly districts â that is, unless -there be
a change of heart among too many peo
ple. It is acknowledged to be a good piece
of work â politically â and also as to allot
ment. Tbe districts, with few exceptions,
are all close In population to -tbe allot
ments, decided upon by a division of the
State's inhabitants under the new census.
The county goi'ernment bill deals main
ly with salaries. It was evolved after
suggestions made by county representa
tives, end in all cases their wishes were
deferred to as much as possible. There
was practically no contest over it on the
f5oor-of either house. It makes few im
portant changes In salaries and very few
of these are reductions.
Code revision was the cause of a great
deal of worry, first over the magnitude
of the work and again because the dis
position to discuss each amendment upon
the floor of each house, indicated* that the
Legislature would sit until October next.
i5ut word was passed around that those
bills had to go through, and like a thor
oughbred touched with .the whip, they
suddenly speeded up, bounded through
both houses, anS went to the Governor.
The -revision consisted of removing the
dead clauses and sections; reconciling
contradictory provisions or eliminating
the more useless: clarifying the language;
taking out those portions which were but
re-enactments of provisions of thecon^
stltution; cutting out provisions that went
against the constitution, and pruning and
trimming and. raking over what 'was loft
until the. codes are now In apparently
Tgood shape.
Three of them are revisedâ the ? Civil
Code, the Penal Cede and the Code of
Civil* Procedure. The Political. Code.- the
indices to the four codes and .the-revision
of the statutes were left for. the commis~
sion during the next" two years;* after a
bill to dissolve the commission had been
stoutly fought; for and against, and had
been finally beaten.
TAX LEVY IS KEPT DOWN.
General Appropriation Bill Less Than
That of Two Years Ago.
The general appropriation is the usual
column of figures. It called for the appro
priation of $5,007,570 for. the two years to.
come. This was $11,000 less than the bill
passed two years ago, and it contained
several "items not formerly included in the
measures. The hand of the Governor can
be seen through it all. Indeed, it' was
he who finally handed it to the commit
tee with the remark that he "didn't want
any changes made in it." Nor were any
of particular Importance made. Beyond
increasing the appropriations for agricul
tural fairs by 25 per cent each, and al
lowing SSOOO more to the Board of Exam
iners, changes which added about $50,000 to
the total, it passed very nearly as it was
introduced. Its companion, the tax levy
bill, fixes the State tax rate at 48.2 cents
for the fifty-third fiscal year and 40.2 for
the fifty-fourth fiscal year. This is on
the IKK) valuation of 51,156,290,672, and will
provide, $5,419,506 for the fifty-third and
$4,419,500 for the fifty-fourth years for all
needs of the State. â¢
While humdrum legislation was the rule,
there were several bills that broke the
monotony of proceedings In both houses
whenever they came up, and they practi
cally fought- th^ir way through. The most
important of these were the bills ratify
ing ihe lease of the China Basin to the
Santa Feand altering certain provisions
of the codes so that nothing could Inter
fere with it. The bills were introduced by
Davis in' the Senate and by Brown of San
Mateo in the House. It was Davis' meas
ures, however, that- got Ihe lead and went
through. There was talk of a "stand up",
en the part of the opposition, -but not a
dollar of Santa Fe money could be found.
It was told to one of the opposition that if
$10 could buy both houses the bills would
be allowed to die on file before it would be
put up. It was a clean, hard fight, and
the push was. downed in the end. Smith
of Kern and Davis of Amador delivered
two of the best speeches of the session
in support of the ratification measure,
and the figiit in the Senate was won only
after the. evening session had nearly
passed. In the Assembly the fight was
nearly- as bitter, but not so long. The
accompanying bills followed ' the ratifica
tion bills without much opposition. .There
is another bill bearing on the same sub
ject, and a constitutional amendment as
well, but .. these, were allowed to die on
tile, as they are not of much importance.
The other bills are in the Governor's
hands.
' The bill r introduced in the Senate by
Simpson and In the Assembly by Brough
ton providing means whereby, street rail
way franchises might be 'bought and sold
was another that left a-traij of wrecked
hopes, roil calls and negative votes in its
track. It has become a law by the lapse
of ten legislative days. The bill's princi
pal provision is that when a franchise is
put up for competition and sealed bids are
received, the bidding does not stop there.
It may be continued in open competi
tion until one bidder wins out. It waa,a
railroad measure; and was drawn to give
the corporation with the longest purse
control of the franchise field. It has bfe
come a law by the lapse of ten legislative
days, . ' â¢ Â¦ -, . '
; Another hard fought piece of legislation
waji Assembly constitutional amendment
No. 2S, introduced by Laird. of Bakersfleld.
It provides for a. commission of five mem
bers â¢which will have complete control
over rates ' on gas;.' water. 1 , electricity for
light and power. . telephones and tele
prams, expressage and express compa
nies, sleeping ' car companies, railroads
and all other common carriers, and to
have general control over those compa
nies. The amendment slipped through the
Assembly without much opposition, but it
was bitterly fought in the Senate down
through final passage and reconsideration.
It has got to pass a vote of the people.
It was known as a railroad measure, but
all corporate influences were behind it.

'session. The one appropriating $100,000 for
the State Board of Health, to be used In
dealing with the plague problem,', went
thfougrh easily, but one of the other meas
ures met with furious opposition. This
was the bill making it a felony to publish,
by writing -or printing,^ that Asiatic chol
era, bubonic plague or other infectious or
icontagio-us disease- exists or has' recently,
existed within, the State unless .the fact
has been "determined : by the State Board
of Health and entered upon its minutes;
'The. opposition was so strong that amend-
I rnents were â¢finally accepted cutting â¢ out
"or. other Infectious or contagious dis
eases" and "or has" previously existed,"
and permitting local health officers to
make their regular reports. In the form
it passed it is not regarded as a menace
to freedom of speech or of -the press.
The last of the stubborn contests came
on the-Curtln franchise assessment bill
It was not well understood, and during
the course of the tight members frequent
ly changed fnJm one side to the other and
back again, now convinced that it was
equitable and now that it was a piece of
most -rlcioue legislation.'. The bill Is In
thct Governor's hands. "If Is a measure
that, the banks wanted and that the MaV
ket-etreet Railway wanted. As amend
ed, the assessable value of a franchise
must be determined by subtracting from
the full cash value of the corporation's

NO MONEY FOB HIGHWAYS.
Veto Awaits All Bills of This Nature
That Passed.
The subject of highways caused a great
deal of discussion, for it was feared to
open up the question because of the num
ber of bills which were being held in
readiness. As it was", bills providing for
the appropriation of '$1,200,000 were intro
duced. It was finally decided to let only
a few of them go through, but the Gov
ernor has vetoed the first and most im
portant, the Yosemite road bill, and in
doing so he has declared he will veto
all others. ' ."! Â¦
The gist of the State highway matter
was summed up by the Senate Finance
Committee in a constitutional amend
ment which passed both houses.
Under the present law' the State can
not aid a county road. The only thing
the State can do is to take possession of
the road, make it a State highway and
pay all expenses of construction, care and
maintenance. By the . amendment, pro
posed the 'State is allowed to aid county,
roads without going further than that.'
The mining debris bill appropriating
$150,000 for co-operation with the Federal
Government in the construction of a de
bris Â¦ Impounding system on the Yuba.
River, was a bone of contention for a

and received the Governor's signature.
The salary of the Debris Commissioner
was reduced from $3000 per year to $800.
A bill creating a State Inspector of
Mines was defeated in the Assembly.
A bill providing for the provisional lo
cation of oil claims pending, discovery
died on the file. A bill compelling the
plugging of water flowing wells in order
to prevent the water from working Into
the oil bearing sands has gone to the Gov
ernor; also one regulating the proper
marking of oil products. '
The general appropriation bill allows the
State Mining Bureau such a sum as will
Insure a thoroush investigation of the
State's oil resources during the next two
Great care was devoted by the Irriga
tion committees/of the two houses to the
study of the problem of how to furnish a
method by which irrigation districts or
ganized under the Wright act might be
dissolved. Senator Nutfs bill passed both
houses, but was vetoed by the Governor.
The Assembly committee also prepared
a bill providing for the refunding of the
bonds of Irrigation districts, but it failed
to get further than simply on the file.
' The cuestion of woman's suffrage at
schcol electio-s came up through the As

Cutter's constitutional amendment to al
low socials to be held in churches with
out forfeiting the right to exemption
from taxation, was beaten v ln the Senate.
Taylor's amendment exempting State and
municipal bonds -from taxation, the same
that was defeated at the rkst election,
passed both houses and will be submitted

High Schools to be included in the tax
levy, one to provide for amending char
ters, one to divide the State into fish and
games districts, one to maKe eight houw
a day the limit on State work, were
adopted and will also go to the people.
The ease with which corporation and ad
ministration measures went -through
stamped the character of the Legislature
as a whole. The Assembly was a rank
railroad house and the Senate belonged to
the Governor. It was boasted more than
once, and verified in dozens of roll fall*,
that there were forty-seven sure railroad
votes â¢Â¦ in the Assembly and twenty-four
sure votes for the Governor Jn the Sen

ways , but perhaps wrought harm Jn

â¢who has been In charge of the offices eft
seed and plant introduction In the Depart
ment of Agriculture, has been directed to
start In a few days for Honolulu to es
tablish an agricultural experiment station
there. As director his first work will be
to teach the Hawaiian people how to

ported from San Francisco. They will be
taught also the value of dairy cows among
poor families, butter and cheese making,
the forage plants most economically pro
duced for Hawaiian consumption and the
value of poor families raising: chickens
and pigs. This agricultural missionary
work In the Interest of the common peo

sidered. There are 200 acres, running from
the coast to the top of a mountain, set
apart by the Hawaiian Legislature for
this purpose. These matters win be given
attention near the coast, coffee raising
will be studied on the higher elevations
and forestry work will be done on the
mountain tops.
the wild clanginsr of a fire engine gong
was heard, and down the street at . top
speed came a dashing fire truck. Its way
lay through the crowd beyond where the
police lines were formed. The people
made wild rushes In every direction to es
cape ; the threatened danger, but the
driver of the truck handling his horses
skillfully., all escaped without injury.
President MeKinley was half-way be
tween the sidewalk and the church when
the confusion attracted his attention, and
he stopped short with an expression of
anxiety on his face until the truek had
passed and done no harm.
Scene at the Church.
It was 2:30 o'clock when the procession
arrived at the church, and for one hour
and twenty minutes before that time the
edifice had been packed to its utmost ca
pacity. Directly after the morning re
ligious services in the church the ushers
who were to take charge of the crowd
during the funeral service of the after
noon, went â¢ into the church to complete
their final arrangements. Lons ribbons of
silk, white upon one side, black'on the ref
Verse, were stretched around twenty pews
In the body of the church and fifteen on
each side, making a total reservation of
fifty pews for the family, pallbearers and
visitors. While the ushers were still at
work the people holding cards of admis
sion to the church commenced to arrive.
The honorary and actuai pall-bearers
came slowly up the north center aisle,
filing Into the seats at the side. The ush
ers, forming in column near the door,
came up the south aisle acting as an es-
I cort to the President, who was accom
i panled by Mrs. Durbln. As the President
: reached the pew set apart for him tin
! ushers turned and facd him. He bowed
I his thanks for the honor and then, usher
! ing Mrs. Durbin into the pew, followed
I after. Governor Durbin and Secretary
Cortelyou filled the pew. Immediately in
front of the Â«casket and bnhlnd the pall-
I bearers came Rev. M. L. Halnes and Rev.
' Samuel J. Nichols.
! Immediately following the casket wero
Lieutenant Commander Parker and Mrs.
Harrison. They occupied the second seat
from the front to the left of the , north
center aisle, corresponding to that of the
President on the south aisle. With them
were Frank Tlbbett, General Harrison's
private secretary, and Mrs. Parker. Foi
fowing' these were Mr. and Mrs. Russell

Widow Controls Emotion.
Gathered around the Harrison lot in
Crown Hill Cemetery anu standing, in
solid masses- along the winding road
wnich led to the place were thousands of
people who with bowed heads ; and â¢ mani
festations of sincere sorrow watched the
funeral procession take its way . through
the grounds. HMHBTC9 aaa Ml!Â£9MBMflK
On the arm of ' Lieutenant ' Commander
Parker Mrs. Harrison took her â¢Â¦ place at
the head of ; the ; coffin, which : had s been
borne to the side of the grave by. the pall
bearers. Through the Â¦ heavy. ... mourning
veil . which she wore - there ' were . visible
signs of the grief through - which *; she
had passed. Her lips trembled and it was
evident that she kept hej* emotion' under
control by the greatest effort.
Near her on the left stood the igeneral's
son, Russell B. . Harrison, vwlth his -wife,
and Mr. and Mrs. McKee. 7 Mr/. Harrison
kept his eyes fixed upon the casket, -never
turning them away from â¢ it during - the
service. Mrs. Russell Harrison and : Mrs.
McKee were composed, but now and 'then
a little storm* of emotion, would shake
them and their faces would' be .buried In
their Â¦ handkerchiefs. The -brothers " of :
General â¢ Harrison. John ., Scott â¢. Harrison
and .: Carter ..B. Harrison, stood 'close to

President' McKinley. came to the grave
with Mrs. Durbln and stood -with her dur
ing the brief service. When â¢ the prayer
was offered the President was seemingly
deeply in thought and remained bo with
bowed head after the linal word had been
said.
While some around the grave raised
their hats to protect their neads, the Pres
ident kept his in his hand throughout the
service. Beside him were Governor Dur
bin and Private Secretary Cortelyou.
Fifty _ yards away from the circle .of
mourners and from the tomb were thou
sands who heard and watched the cere
mony. The burial service was very simple
and very .brief . Rev. ; Mr. Nichols read
the short committal and burial .service,
and Rev. Mr. Halnes followed with a
prayer.
White Flowers on 'Coffin.
Instead of following the usual practice,
which consists of dropping a few grains
of dust on the .coffin, three white carna
tions were placed upon the lid. When the
last word had been said and the service
was over the attendants lowered the cof
fin to its. place. To the last It bore the
wreath from Mrs. Harrison and the bou
quet of lilies of the valley from little
Elizabeth. On "the coffin was placed a
heavy walnut protecting cover, and then
the granite roof of the tomb was lowered
and closed.
The " last resting place of ex-President
Harrison Is a tomb five feet deep, encased
In granite four Inches thick and covered
with a granite top of the same .thickness.
On the reverse Bide of the cover is the
simple inscription, "Benjamin Harrison,
1833-1901."
The interior of the tomb was decorated
with ferns so; profusely that no sign of
earth or stone was visible. Dozens of ex
quisitely beautiful floral tributes were
placed on the tomb and on the ground
close by.
There seemed to be a hesitation on the
part of the spectators to leave when the
services were over. After the mourning
party had left and was being placed in
the carriages the thousands of spectators
stood and looked long at the grave.

American Republics All Ac
cept Invitations to Big
Conference.
WASHINGTON, March 17.â Responses
have now been received from practically
all of the South and Central American re
publics accepting the Invitation to partic
ipate in the conference of American repub
lics, which is to be held in the City of
Mexico next October. The preliminary
work of the congress has been directed
from' Washington, as the United States
Government has taken great Interest in
the meeting and has had the co-operation
nere of the representatives of the south
ern countries. Several a of the republics
already efther have chosen their delegates
or have names under consideration.
The Guatemalan Minister in Washing
ton. Senor Lazo Arriaga, has been desig
nated by his Government to represent it,
but he has not yet determined whether he
will accept the mission. It is understood
that the Brazilian delegates have been
chosen, and that the names of those who
will represent Chile 'are selected, condi
tional upon the extent of participation
which Chile will have in the congress. The
personnel of the delegates from the United
States is beginning to' attract attention,
and In South American circles there is an
earnest desire that at least one of the
delegates from this country shall sustain
some official relation to the State Depart
ment. In the former congress. Â¦. held . in
Washington, Mr. Blaine 'was a conspicu
ous figure, and the southern republics are
desirous: that there be like prominence
at the coming congress, v-v v,
Little attention has yet been given \to
the consideration of particular names
yet ; among - those Informally mentioned
are Assistant Secretary of State Hill, Di
rector Rockhlll of the Bureau of American
Republics and John Barrett Moore, who
was Assistant Â¦ Secretary of State during
Judge Day's administration of the State
Department. Mr. Moore's name has come
up In connection with the researches he
has . made on the subject of arbitration,
which promises to.be one of the 'most In
teresting themes before the congress. The
South American republics have shown a
strong Inclination toward arbitration In
the settlement of their frequent boundary
difficulties, r. and :â¢Â¦ there Is a tendency - to
adopt this method quite generally, and if
possible i universally, to avoid border : con
flicts and: their menace of war. Some. of
those Interested In: the congress have
hoped to see it bring results similar to
The Hague Â¦ congress, with -. a'- permanent
court >' of Â¦ arbitration for the western-re
publics' like that at The Hague for inter
national ! conflicts, In which the countries
of Europe and the United States might be
Involved. : None of the southern republics
was represented at The Hague conference.
The sentiment .for. arbitration wa3
strong Hn -the last^South; American con
gress,' and in the recent congress at > Mad
rid it again took Â» form.' ,'At the same time
it. has been '-understood r that Chile might
not desire : ;; to participate Â¦ if r the . subject
was ' to be 'discussed In such form as to
involve the ; pending controversy between
Chile,. Peru and ; Bolivia. 'Â¦- In _ signifying
her purpose , to accept the Chilean author
ities <said^ In; substance' that 'it. would be
conditional upon the discussion of no top
ics .which would involve pending questions
in * which ithat '-Â¦Â¦ country was Â¦', concerned.

NEW YORK, March 17.â The steam
ship New York reached her dock at 10
o'clock to-night after a. passage in which
an explosion of an ammonia tank and a
broken shaft caused loss of life and
much damage to the vessel.
As a result of the explosion fifteen men
Â¦were overcome by the fumes of ammonia
ca Thursday last and seriously prostrat
ed, two deaths following. Both victims
were buried at sea. Several others were
cuntir.ed to the ship's hospital for some
time, and one was etlii m tne hospital

Onboard with Engkvist were his three
children, all of whom are young and who
will go to the home of an aunt. F. Col

lroqj inflammation of the lungs.
Superintendent Hakes Statement.
According to a statement made by Su
perintendent James A. Wright of the
American line after he had gone on
board the vessel and talked with her of
iicers, the explosion or escape of am
monia, as it was termed by Mr. Wright,
occurred at half-past 6 o'clock Thursday
morning: The bonnet of the condenser
on the refrigerating apparatus was forced
in some manner. The apparatus is in the
after portion of the main deck, on the
starboard side.
JCear the refrigerating apparatus at the
time were eleven stewards, steerage and
cabin, and fifteen steerage passengers.
When the ammonia fumes burst out into
the compartment, which is on the same
deck as the main dining saloon, there
was a mad rush for escape. Some were
overcome by the fumes and dropped to
the floor. Others were able to get out of
the room and others at once made to
open up the compartment and let the am
monia escape. This took some time, how
ever, and those who had first escaped,
after petting a breath of pure air. rushed
back into the place and assisted those
â¢who had been unable to get out.
All Are Prostrated.
All these were more or less prostrated
by the fumes, but only a few had to go
to the ship's hospital. The stewards.
Kent and Colston, -were among them, as
was Engkvlst. Engkvlst's death, accord

Wright, was primarily due to heart dis
ease, but It was said that it was super-

The breaking of the shaft occurred at

The shaft broke near the propeller on the
port Elde of the ship. It did not drop out
and a boat was lowered and the propeller

GREEN INSTEAD
OF OLD GLORY
SPOKANE, March 17.â The American
colors flying at half-mast from the High
School tower in memory of the late Ben
jamin Harrison were torn down to-day and
green bunting was substituted .by, some
unknown 8t. Patrick's day enthusiast.
The substitulon was discovered early in
the day and rectified. Much indignation
has been expressed by the school authori
ties and others. Several ministers con
demned the act from their pulpits.
The attention of School Superintendent
Saylor was called to the substltulon
about 10 a. m. With the Janitor pro
ceeded to the rchool. They encountered
difficulties in getting into the tower. The
St. ' Patrick's day enthusiasts had taken
off the tower door and braced it above
the hatchway leading to the attic, so that
one side of the door was directly over the
trap and the other resting against the
wall, its resistance proving quite effectual
for a time. What appeared from a dis
tance to be a fine green silk flag turned
out to be a mere piece of bunting, fifteen
feet long and four, feet wide, which was
removed with all speed and lcis ceremony.
Mr. Saylor procured an American flag of
his own immediately and had It hoisted.
It is believed that students stole the tow
er key from the secretary's office and
made the substitution last night. Efforts
will be made to discover and punish the
guilty persons.
"It was the wish of President McKin
ley," said Mr. Saylor. "that on every pub
lic building In the United States the Stars
and Stripes should fly at halT-mast to-day.
It is my . sentiment that no flag should
ever supersede the American emblem."

their lives. He was at last killed by an
electric wire which he tried to pull down.
His skin alone weighed 1100 pounds. The
skeleton, which is fifteen feet high, is now
on exhibition. One tusk weighed 217
pounds. The town in which he was killed
looked as If it had been visited by an
earthquake.
"The last part of January was .very
mild, but this month beats them all. It
is from 40 to 60 degrees below zero every
day. The town Is overrun with mad dogs
and ladies cannot go out at all. The po
lice have killed hundreds of the animals
already and shoot every one running loose
on the street. Poor food and cold weather
is the cause of it. and scientists say the
brain becomes frozen. The^ays of the
dog are numbered in DawsoiTand horses
will take their places.
"A lady froze to the sidewalk last week
while talking to a friend. A waterman
had spilled some water on the walk, and
she stood on it, her shoes freezing tight
to the ground. When she started to go
she could not move and fainted. Some
men secured an ax and cut her loose.
Since that time no one is allowed to walk
on the street on such a cold day. Next
month cannot be so cold, as the sun is
too high already.
"Dawson is overrun with rats. In every
house there are hundreds, and as they
run between the paper walls and over the

A clipping from the Klondike Xugset en

the cold that prevailed in that section
when the letter was written. The clip

"The fact that the Indicator In the ther

the neighborhood of 50 degrees below has
brought to the attention of the public a
realization of the fact that winter is not
yet a thing of the past In this portion of

little below 40 degrees, was much more
biting and chilling than a few weeks ago
when It was fully 20 degrees colder.

STREET, N. W., WASHINGTON, March
17._If the view of the administration is
supported by the next Congress, the
President will be given discretionary au
thority to acquire cither the Nicaragua
or Panama canal route. Thus has the
stock of the Panama Canal risen since the
adjournment of Congress.
Several prominent members of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee favor
the idea of empowering the President to
choose the route he thinks more advan
tageous, although the bill which passed
the House and was pending before the
Senate during the last session provided
for the adoption of the Nicaragua project.
Secretary Hay requested Mr. Sllva. the
Colombian Minister, to Bubmlt a formal
memorandum, embodying verbal pro
posals regarding the American acquisition
of the Panama canal route which were
submitted a few days ago.
It has practically become a case of
Colombia bidding against Nicaragua and
Costa Rica, with the United States acting
as both purchaser aad auctioneer. The
situation Is. therefore, such that this Gov
ernment will obtain the most advan
tageous terms. It is believed the arrange
ments would be still more favorable to
the United States if the bill to be enacted
should place in the President's hands .the
choice of the two routes. The authorities
understand there is a strong probability
that Congress will abrogate the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty.

ST. .PATRICK'S DAY dawned this year upon
an Irish people well-nigh united on the chief
subject of their immediate political aspirations.
Whatever differences of opinion may exist concerning
home rule, there are almost none upon the question
cf.establishing a peasant proprietorship of Irish land-;.
That much was made evident by. the recent debate
upon the question in Parliament. Not only did all'
the Nationalists support the measure but many.Union
ists did so, and the London Times Has 'said that suciv;
Unionists as vbtefcj with ihe Governmentvvere induced
to . do so solely by Balfours appeal to them'not to
join in what would be recognized as a vote of censure.
It is therefore fair to infer that such Irish members
as voted with the Government on that occasion did so,
not because they, oppose the land purchase plan 'but
because they believe that on the whole the present
Ministry should be retained in" power. , : â¢
It .is ;admitted by. the leading^British papers that
the land purchase .question is. not.g;mere" repetition of
the old Irish discontents, but is 'a new phase "of Irish *
development.-.. The act carried by Gladstone in i8^r
establishing land coiuts to fix rent] rates in Ireland
has proven a failure. The land courts, in jfact, have
disturbed the relations of landlord and. tenant without:
helping either. They .have destroyed the responsibility
of the owners of the property) but have. not ' protected"" Â¦
'the rights ofthe renters. In a recent speech in Parlia
ment Mf. : Redmond described the landlord in IrelariJ
LAND PURCHASE IN IRELAND.
It h noted that of the twenty-seven towns or camps
icporJed in Alaska by the census of 1900 only nin?
n-ere in existence in i3oo. Of the new places Nome
City is the metropolis. It is credited with having last
year 2 population of 12^468, and may fairly claim to
be :hc Empire City of the Midnight Sun.
The height of side protection has de
creased from 13 feet 8 Inches to H feet In
the Duncan class now buildtnjr. The qual
ity of armor has passed from, compressed
to Harveylzed and Krupp and has kept
well In advance of tho guns, and the bat
tleships now under construction for the
several navies are undoubtedly less liable
to be destroyed by projectiles than those
built with the Inflexible in 1S81. ' ?i .
CONTINUED COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY.
TRADE last week stood about as it did the pre
ceding week. There was the same activity in
iron, recalling il.e boom of 1S89, the same good
Â¦ retail irade throughout the West, Xorthwest^and;
South, the same strength in lumber and the s^me'la's
5?tude in' woolen and cotton fabrics. There was noth
ing going 0:1 in Wall street worthy of extendel
mention, prices ruling; strong with a number of ad
vance*, though the peblic were not in it and thi
professionals had the market pretty much to them
tclves. Purchasing cf the-bestiuui safest bonds and
'stocks lor' dividends contimieS 0 the feature of the
street, which is a very good Mgn. The money market
continv.cd easy, the disbursement of some $25,000,003
in dividends and the .'â¢nnounccmfnt of an enormous
quantity of gold in the United States treasury pointing
to a plethora rather 1'ian a scarcity. The amount was
$^8.2.91^,000. against 54 16.2 18,000 on the same date lasf
year, the amotir.t now on hand breaking all previou
records. The increase in the gold holdings of Axw
Government during. thi past year haÂ« been $65,654,800.
and is still going on at the rate of about $5,000,000
per month, though it will decrease when the new rev
enue law goes into effect. In view of this immense
supply of gold and the continued increase in railroad
earnings it is pretty hard. to muster any bear Â¦feelinp:
in Wall street. The bank clearings, too, continue to
add their influence .0 the bullish sentiment.'.'tbe In

being 30.7 per cent, and every city of any consequence
except Minneapolis showed a gain. The failures- are
, still exceeding those of ipoo, however, those' for the
week being 217, again'st 100 last year. â¢ .- â¢ ..
The main feature of the* week was the upward turn
in wheat, which advanced fclightly every day during
ihe latter half, under the influence of the Government
report, which showed 30,000,000 bushels less in farm
ers' hands than a year ago, and decreased shipments
from the Argentine. Foreign exporters came out -of
their holes and began. to buy, and it looked as if the
export business had again acquired steerage way.' 'ThÂ»
raw wool situation, too, seemed to be clearing, saleÂ»
being larger, Eastern stocks smarter and declining and
the foreign markets stronger. The shortage of cars
throughout the country which has lately been disas
trous to the California orange trade accentuated thi
reports of an active railroad movement The West
reported an active market for dry goods and clothing,
and the New England boot and shoe factories liberal
orders, some of them having their full capacity en
gaged up to September, while leather continues firm
and active. But the iron trade still leads all others,
as it has done for several years. The steel; mills^are
away behind in their orders, and the greatV-develop
ment of the oil industry throughout the country is
causing an active demand for pipe and drilling mate
rial. Steel rail contracts are being increased and the
railroads are ordering additional rolling stock. AM
these conditions indicate great commercial activity in
the United States. Â¦ Apparently the immense improve
ment in business which followed the first election for.
President McKinley has not. yet passed its zenith,
though nobody expected that it would last as long as
it has... . . x-'It't 'Â¦Â¦- .
Locally there is nothing new. San Francisco re-.
, fleets the prosperity of the East in most' liries bf
- merchandise^and produce. Even the dried fruit mar
ket is picking up, an.1 for a fortnight or "more "then
has been an active demand for prunes at Eastern
centers, which, if it continues, will mean much' to o
number of important agricultural districts around the
bay. Wheat jind prunes have for months been the
dullest articles of farm produce in the list, and their
awakening into activity may be the herald of increased
life all along the line. Certainly the crop. prospects
could not be more brilliant, and as money continues
in large supply at easy rates,- the general expectation
of a prosperous year seems well founded. ' â¢

to-do even, tapers rolled from old news
papers were constantly employed In light
ing lamps and starting fires, to husband
the high priced matches. To increase the
consumption of the match company's pro
duct it must be sold for less money, and
yet there must remain a profit.
Mr. Barber has toiled all his life at the
task of improving methods of manufactur
ing matches. Notwithstanding the won
derful success which has attended his ef
forts in this direction, he is still striving
to make further Improvements In the
matches turned out by millions by the
corporation of which he is the head.
Making the World's Matches.
When the Diamond Match Company was
organized in 1SS1 Mr. Barber, because of
his commanding position in the trade, was
made the president of the corporation. He
still occupies that position. A small num
ber of Independent match companies were
brought under one management In the be
ginning. The greatest growth of the busi
ness has been in the wonderful extension
which the Diamond Match Company has
made. In addition to Its commanding po
sition in the United States its enormous
trade and its profitable holdings, includ
ing vast pine forests worth millions of
dollars, the company has built factories
in many foreign countries. It was Presi
dent Barber who secured Government
concessions and privileges in Europe
which are of very great value, The court
esy and business , shrewdness which he
found essential to success as a salesman
of matches to country storekeepers In
Ohio many years ago have stood him in
good stead in these far greater transac
tions with foreign governments of later
days.
The making of matches r.ow has been
reduced to a point that Is positively mar
velous, largely through O. C. Barber's in
creasing efforts, his disposition to be en
tirely satisfied with nothing and his un
failing belief that further improvements
are always possible. To-day blocks of
wood are fed into a machine and come out
finished matches. Great sheets of straw
board are fed into another machine and
are" delivered in the shape of finished
match boxes.
Combating Hatch-Makers' Malady.
- In the mlddlo history of match manu
facturing phosphorus poisoning was the
bane of the business. The diseaseâ for
such It wasâ often resulted In death, and,
if not that, at least in the removal of a
part or. all of Ihe afflicted person's jaw
bone. Mr. Barber undertook, years asm,
to remove this curse and thus lessen the
danger to his employes. The Diamond
Match Company now pays a'high salary
to an expert dentist who gives all his time
to examinations of the teeth and gums of
its workmen, seeing to it that they are
sound and well cared for. The company's
shops are ventilated with the greatest
care by a system more complete, it is as
serted, than that used In any other line
of manufacturing, so that the fumes from
the chemicals usedâ especially the phos
phorus fumesâ may be quickly carried off
and thus rendered harmless. By these
precautions th* number of cases of-phos
phorus poisoning has been reduced of late
years by more than 90 per cent.
Mr. Barber, who has been 111 himself
scarcely a day in his whole life, takes a
great Interest In the Akron City Hospital
and has plans in view for many improve
ments in that institution. At this time an
offer made by him to give the hospital
$100,000 is pending, while other citizens
are' subscribing $15,000 to pay the hospi
tal's debt, the only conditions he Imposed
in his proposition thus, to aid the charity.
Growth of Barberton.
The town of Barberton takes much of
Its founder's time. Every year he Is there
to make -the Fourth of July address at
the annual celebration. He has given, a
library to the town and has subscribed
most generously to other public under
takings. Â¦ He has secured many factories
for the little city and is proud of Its
growth. "Some day we shall annex Ak
ron," he Is fond of saying. "There Is not
an old man In our city. We are in our
infancy now."
His faith In Barberton Is shown by his
large investments there in many lines, of
manufacturing and in real estate. The
tract of 360 . acres . on . which he Intends
building: a handsome residence to he sur
rounded by a park cost him $66,500 tho last
year. It was Mr. Barber's intention at
the beginning to establish at Barberton
a great factory for the manufacture of
soda ash. â¢ Before his plan took definite
shape, however, he had interested himself
in a- similar enterprise near Cleveland
But he decided to build up Barberton in
eplte of his change of plan. Slowly at
first, then more and more rapidly, as he
placed factory after factory upon his
farm land, a town grew up. There is
every prospect that, when Its founder
shall look over Barbfrton In years to
come from his. new home on the hilltop.
It will be worthy of the name of city. Al
ready it has surpassed his expectations,
but, as is characteristic of him, he 13 not
and will not be content to have It stop
growing.
Mr. -Barber. married Miss Anna Brown
of Akron when a young man. Her death
occurred several years ago. He has one
daughter. Anna, the wife of Dr. Arthur
Bevan of Chicago.

THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION.
WITH something. of gratification the people. of
California can review the proceedings of the
- recent session of the Legislature and compare
them with the proceedings of. former sessions.. There
has been this year no disturbance of legislative work
by Senatorial contests or by county division scheme;.
There have been no rc&ndals of a serious nature, and
hardly even any intimations of bribery and corruption.
The utmost of that, kind that has appearedhas Keen
in the nature "of signs of an eagerness on the '"part
of some of the legislators to obtain money for their
votes, but no evidence has b'een forthcoming to justify
suspicion that they received it. â¢ , ' Â¦â¢ Â»Â¦
Taken as a whole,/ tht "Work of' the session has
been well done, and /in many, respects it has beei
important work. '* The Ratification of the lease of China
Basin to the Santa 'Fc. Railroad, the passage" of the
code revision bills," the 'adoption of a" primary law,
the appropriation of $250,000 for/the University of Cal
ifornia for the next biennial period, and the vote of
an equal sum for the purchase of the Big Basin red
wood forest, are each and all of them measures which
deal with great issues of State politics and will be of
lasting good to the community. Thus, while there has
been little evil to complain of, there has been' much
genuine work to note with satisfaction.
â¢ There will, of course, be differences of opinion con
cerning the relative merits of the measures, adopted.
That much was made evident by the reviews of the
session furnished to The Call by leaders ofsthe Senate^
and of the-Xssemblyiand published yesterday. "Thus
Senator Davis says that while the large majority of
the dominant party "might have invited recklessness
or extravagance, no session has been freer from scan
dals and no session has accomplished more in the way
of positive legislation." He went on to say: 1 "The
general appropriation bill has cut off all needless ex
pense of maintenance in the public service, and the
State tax rate is the lowest in many a year." On the
other side, W. F. Cowan, who represents the minority,
says: "Extravagance has been the keynote for the
majority of the members. Very few bills or. resolu
tions carrying appropriations have met with defeat.
The barriers of the Bclshaw act were let down and
attaches came in swaYms." â¢ â¢- â¢-:,,â¢
Another difference 'of opinion appears in the judg
ment^ upon the primary election law. 'Senatpr Davis
says: "Every effort has been made to frame an hones*,
primary law, and I. it is believed the -bill passed will,
if it be approved, make it possible for political decency
to. control the organizations of both political -parties
in .the. large- centers of. population and ior the San
Francisco delegation in our State conventions to be
something more than a bunch of asparagus tied by
a string in the hands of a boss." On the other, hand,
Mr. Cowan says: "The test adoptedabsolutely vitiates
the bill, and it will be with poor grace that the Repub
lican party^may lay claim to "any glory for reform in
this direction."
Such differences of opinion are largely due to par
tisan points of view. ; : Mr.Gowan'natufally : seeks in
the action of the session for such material as can be
used, in campaigning against the Republican party.
He is quite right in condemning the excessive number
of employes put upon the payrolls of both the Senaje
and the Assembly.. Whether his objections to/ the
primary law are valid remains to\be!seen. Untifit
lias been tried before the Supreme Court and in prac
tical operation no one can accurately judge its merits.
Meantime it is gratifying to have such a biira'dopted.
Altogether the most important development of the
session is that brought out by Senator: Smith in the
statement: , "A notable feature 'of .the treridof legisla
tion is found in the ; increasing demands upon* ths
public treasury for public improvements. 'The. ini*
pounding V)f debris,. the improvement of navigation
and drainage, the 'storage and conservation of water
for irrigation, the purchase of forests for recreation
grounds and the construction of public highways arc
but a. portibn,of the subjects, proposed,; and in -each
case urged with great vigor by at least a portion of
the people." â¢ .'
/These are indeed the chief issues that confront Cali
fornia, and it is inevitable r they should soon become
the* main questions of State politics. -To properly. deal
with them ' it ; will be necessary for the people to ) elect
to the Â¦Legislature." men /of -progressive' ideas, genuine
patriotism V and; a high'r degree, of statesmanship. It
cannot be questioned that we have .in- California men
vQ'uite' competent to'. solve* all the problems such issues
present, nor can it be doubted that the people have
sufficient intelligence to /elect: such men as soon a*
it /.becomes . recognized that their services are needed.
Consequently we can look forward to an improvement
in politics as well as in; other things; from the .appear-'
arice'of these problems in the 'field of State legislation.
., The outlook : is. therefore brigiity* We liave begun
A h J? n e .w cehtury,;by a legislative session -without scan
dals and without "any/controversies that leave* behind
them bitterness - and ili-will. Democrats will, of
course, find cause for denouncing; the majority, 'but.

ton-Thompsbn's wild animal stories.
Beginnings of a Great Business.
Ohio C. Barber was only 8 years old
when he was set to work making splints
for the manufacture of matches in his
.father's , barn, at Middiebury. now a par;
of Akron. His father was Ueorse Barber,
a poor man, but awake to the needs of his
day and generation, is his son has been
after him. This characteristic in the elder
Barber led him to begin tho manufacture
of matches on a scale as erreat as hH
means would permit, about 184.0. In those
days the lucifers were made by a gang
of 'fine circular saws, so that when the
operation was completed the strips resem
bled a 'double-edged, coarse-toothed comb.
.The open ends of the strips having been
dipped in a composition made principally
of sulphur-;-*.- slow-ournlng, expensive
match was secured by 3awlng through the
center of the comb lengthwise and sepa
rating the teeth toy splitting each - from
the main body. In the beginning th-j
matches had been marketed without be
ing split apart, because of tho theory that
they would ignite themselves if packea
more closelr.
There was not much play for little Ohio
Barber. He went' to school when there
was a school to which he could go, but
his holidays and odd hours were spent
in the primitive match factory- His
father, though a man of little learntng,
had the foresight to know that his busi
ness,' unless calamities befell, some day
must be of such proportions as to require
a. manager possessing a fair, education.
So he hired other help and sent his boy
to school. But young Ohio was -an en
thusiast In the business of making
matches and even as a boy had many
ideas about - improving the methods of
their manufacture. He was only 16 when
his father agreed with him that he could
read and write and cipher sufficiently
well, to permit of his giving his time en
tirely to business. However, the learn
ing he had was too valuable to permit
.of the -lad- being employed at common
labor .in the shop and tho father was
able to do all that was necessary in work
requiring skill. Young Barber, therefore,
was provided with a horse and covered
wagon and put uppn the road as a trav
eling salesman. His territory included
all of Ohio. He sold the product of his
father's little shop to country merchants
and dealers in the larger towns and
cities. His industry and success as a
f.i losnian brought more work for .tho. fac
tory and from time to time additions
were made to the force of workmen and
to the Investment in machinery.. ..
How Progress Was Brought About.
"We are too plow, father," the young
salesman said upon returning from one
of his strips. "We must make matches
by ; some faster -process,,, and we must
make use wherever we -can of the rail
roads that are being built, to get our
goods into the hands of the wholesalers
and retailers more quickly. We shall
have to confine ourselves to the. whole
sale trade before long."
The elder Barber < agreed with his son.
who picked up ideas rapidly during busi
ness trips. He had already made some Im
provements In the method of match manu
facturing, and father and son worked' to
gether to make still others. They suc
ceeded, and year after year .the business
prew.*-. When- the son was 24 years oldâ In
1865â the Barber Match Company was or
ganized, and the business was removed to
largo' brick- building in Akron. Ohio C.
Barber was . made secretary of the com
pany.* His acquaintance with the trade
in Ohfo and elsewhere made his services
especially valuable. It was not long be
fore he was at the head of the business.
"Wejrnu&t make matches more econom

peasant proprietors. It is said that small owners could
not drain the swamps and f that, while Ireland is m

THE RACE TRACK VETO.
yvyi AYOR PHELAN, by vetoing the Ingleside
I V track gambling ordinance; has saved the city
from the curse which menaced it. He has
prevented the resumption of an evil which in tim;s
past brought. . upon the community every form of
crime' from petty larceny' to suicide, and . which, .'if
tolerated/. would, undoubtedly have produced. similar
results in the future. By his action the Mayor has
. Â¦ Â«i Â¦ *-â¢ -Â¦ . : ' - . Â¦â¢Â¦,,
upheld the morality* and the well-being of the city,
and in this connection deserves the commendation of
all good citizens. . â¢ ";
There is -the more reason for a public expression
of approval of the Mayor's action because it has
brought upon him the condemnation of many who
have heretofore posed as. his friends and of all those
who expected to profit by the reopening of gambling
at Ingleside. These men have impugned the. Mayor's
motives in vetoing the ordinance and are endeavoring
to discredit the action by every means in their power.
Against such assaults the voice of the better elements
of the community should be heard in protest.
The Call does not pretend to be able to penetratq
the Mayor's heart and discern his motives, nor, so fa
as the public interest is concerned, does it matter what
his motives were. Whether his action was designed
â¢for political purposes, for personal advancement or
for "any form of self-interest; matters nothing. The
one thing of importance to the people is that he has
prevented track gambling at Ingleside and has main
tained the cause of morality, and good government.
It is well known The Call has not been a supporter
of Mayor Phelan. It has criticised him unsparingly
in the public interests and has condemned every action
of his which it deemed prejudicial to the welfare of th:
community. That antagonism which The Call ha?
hefd toward the Mayor's general policy and toward
many of his particular measures does not, however,
blind it to the merit of his present action. In this
instance, at any rate, he has acted wisely. He has set
aside the claims of those who have been acting with
him and has championed the cause of the, whole
people. The Call, though a steadfast political oppo
nent, will never permit partisanship to prevent it from
acknowledging the worth of any official who does his
duty to the public; and therefore, in the name of the
better elements of the* community, it says to, .Mayor
Phelan: In vetoing the race track gambling ordinance
you luve'donc well.
THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAW.
DESPITE the ordinance of this city forbidding
track 'gambling at Inglesidc certain men claim
Â¦ ing to represent the wealth and respectability
of the State, and making the further claim of actin.7
in xite interest of honest sport and of horse breeding,
deliberately violated the law on Saturday by holding
a racing meeting at Inglesidc and sanctioning ponl
'feJliri.g"a"ri9?b<^.k'making in the inciosure. These same
in en have "announced positively that they will hold a
racing meeting at Tanioran Park to-day, nbtwitltttind*
ing the fact that the law of San Mateo County forbioj;
any such- meeting.
Such are the facts iliit confront the officers of the
law in this county an j in San -Matco.' The violation
was dorc defibcfately'urthis'cojirity" on Saturday. A
signed statement by Mayor Pjlelan, published in an
other column this morning, asserts that the me.i who
held the racing at Ingleside track on that day were
informed on Friday that the ordinance permitting
poolsclling and bookmaking within that inclosure had
hcen VctocH* '"Notwithstanding; that knowledge; re
ceived" directly from' the- Mayor himself, they went
forward with their illegal programme. They now pro
pose to show an cquil contempt of law in San Mateo
County. â¢
The duties of the. officers of the law under such
circumstances 1 are clear. The guilty parties, should
be. arrested, brought into court and evidence furnished
to convict them. It is to be borne in mind that th:
persons -'wbo are morally and legally most guilty are
iÂ«ot clerks and other: subordinate persons but the men
who control the track and who direct and carry out
the.; violation of the law. The fact that those men
are rich should not be sufficient to enable them to
escape the penalty of their actions. This is not a
government which has one law for. the rich and an
other for the poor. It is a land where laws' apply
equally to all, and the officers will be negligent of
their ;'drty and false to their oaths if they arrest a
icvi poor, men 'in .."the employ of the rich violators of
the law and .leave., the employers to go scot-free.
" The people of this and of San Mateo County have
enacted ordinances forbidding bookmaking and pool
selling within their limits. Certain men well known
to the officials have sjready violated the law in this
city and purpose to violate that of San Mateo. Is it
too .much to expect that every "one of those parties
shall be brought to inswer for the offense before the
bar of impartial justice? Â»

AUSTRIA WOULD
BAR OUR GOODS
Indications Are That New
Tarifi Will Ee Framed
to Accomplish This.
WASHINGTON. March 17.â There is a
strong movement in Austria against thÂ«j
importation'; of American products, ac
cording to a dispatch received at the State
Department from -United States Consul
Hossfeld at Trieste. The expiration of
the tariff treaties of Austria-Hungary in
1D02 will 'necessitate a general revision of
the customs laws of the country.and Con
sul Hossfeld. says there is certainly every
indication that the new tariff law will
be framed with a.special view- to v .pro
hibiting'the importation of American
products.-, A "major ty. of Austria's econo
mists * have : no fear of American' retalia
tion, states -the Consul, because Austria
buys from* the United States more than
she sells to her., .
In conclusion, the Consul says that pub
lic opinion certainly appears to be with
the prohibitionists, who are a -well-organ
ized and active body. ..
â¢ The German meat inspection law, abso
lutely prohibiting the importation of
American corned ,. beef, sausages, etc..
which' went â¢ into ; effect some time â¢ ago
has " made no friends, . according to a Â¦ re
port-received at the State Department
from United- States Consul Diedrich at
Bremen. The law has been ' the object . of
very severe criticism in Germany, ac
cording to the Consul, and one of the mo-t
pointed arguments against it is that it do
teats its avowed': purpose of promoting
public health, because the resultant prices
of meat lessen its consumption, while tha
health j of the German nation | demands an
increase.' The:, fact that ;: the meat .In
spection has put the prices up -is -.a
well-established- fact, according to Con
sul ; Diedrich, and . especially among th 3
laboring classes is the , loss of American
corned beef at a' low figure most strongly

ties. When the present Board of Super
visors went into office under the charter
they were confronted with an enormous
debt of $125,000 and were forced to adopt
measures of the strictest economy. At the
beginning of the fiscal year J30.000 was
made available and committees were im
mediately appointed to investigate the
water supply of the Sierras. Their report,
which is now being prepared, will show
how many sources of water supply are
open to the city and what the cost will be
to bring water from the Sierras.
"The people have always looked upon
Lake Tahoe os the favorable source of
supply, Jaut this investigation shows that
the people of Nevada are depending upon
that supply for irrigation purposes, and
that not. one gallon can be taken by us
from the lake. For us to take water from
the lake would damage the people of that
State to the extent of $4,000,000.
"If the rainfall . is not soon materially
increased the reservoirs of the Spring Val
ley Company will be exhausted within two
years. At the end of the present year that
company will have only a half-year's sup
ply on hand. When the water lowers In
the reservoirs the fish and other animal
organism will die, and this will be produc

Decision of Supreme Qpurt of .United
States Removes All ' Doubt
of Ownership.
The numerous suits over the ownership
of the Blythe property have at last been
finally decided, and as a result the prop
erty is in the' market.
The UnIte<K States Supreme. Court,
through Justice Peckham, rendered a de
cision recently which said among other
things: ...
"The right of the defendant in error to
this property has been in litigation for
more than fifteen years, many years after
courts of competent jurisdiction have de
cided in her favor, and we think this writ
of error, judging by the character of the
questions sought to be raised under It, has
been taken for delay only." ;
This decision was handed down In Feb
ruary and confirms the title of Florence
Blythe Moore to the property.

be true to their religion.
The regular choir of the mission sang
the hymns "The Son of God Goes Forth
to War." "My Faith Looks Up to Thee"
and "Guide Me, O Thou Great Je

those confirmed:

It is predicted that the highbinder war
which was transferred from San Jose to
this city some <lays ago will be one of the
fiercest and most severe in. the history of
Chinatown. : Two powerful tongs, the Hip
Sings and the Bow Ons. are at war, and
their determination to spill blood Is man
ifested by the influx of hatchetmen.who
continue to arrive from the interior on
every train. 'â¢'â¢'..
The most alarming feature . of f the war
Is the bitterness felt by the murderous
Mongolians against the police.. The ru
mor has. been prevalent for several days
that a price had been put on the head of
Lieutenant Price and some of his squad
now on duty in the Chinese quarter. The
aggressiveness displayed . by the officers
In their, efforts to ! disarm Chinese j j and
prevent crime has caused much feeling
against them, and while the story .that a
price has been placed on their heads can
not be verified by the heads of the Police
Department it is certain that it is the in
tention of some of the highbinders to make
the officers targets for bullets at the first
opportunity. ' - .'Â¦â¢"Â¦
Friday night the police received Infor
mation that three hired assassins were
lying in wait for Price at the corner of
Dupont and streets, but the
would-be murderers made j their escape,
and have not since been located. - ,
Last Tuesday night Ah Bow made an
attempt to murder Policeman Taylor, and
the policeman had a hard battle to save
his life. â¢ . Taylor also met three armed
highbinders Friday night and had to use
his club to disarm, one of them. Â¦
Friday . night j 100 highbinders arrived
In this city from San Jose for the purpose
of taking part In the hostilities. As the
struggle will not be wholly abandoned In
the Garden City, sixty dangerous Chinese
were sent down from San Francisco. The
exchange was made that the marked men
may not recognize the persons who have
been hired to kill them. The local high
binders are so well known to the mem
bers of each faction in this city that thÂ«r
game usually avoids them. The same
condition of affairs exists in San Jose. >

pointless. In the champion event of six
teen entries, D. J. Healey's Slsquoc took
final honors from the stake favorite, Palo
Alto, in a short run.
The story has been told of how JImrale
Dean sold Sisquoc back to Healey, who
captured first prize with the dog in last
Sunday's event. Now comes Sisquoc to
the fore again, and by way of repetition
snaps a victory from tne stake favorite
in the champion event in yesterday's meet-
Short enders -made a good showing in
both events, though as a rule the betting
was at close odds. In the morning Bona
Fide had | bye with Motto, her kennel
mate. The talent made a mistake in
guessing this one. Bona Fide was quoted
a 5 to 1 favorite, but failed to raise the*
flag. Rollicking Airs followed by beating
Warship in the next go at the same price.
Aeneas surprised t'ut backers x>( Honor
Bright, a 3 to 1 favorite, and in the cham
pion event Ireland beat Mose pointless at
those figures. The seventeen other up
sets averaged at less than 2 to 1. After
Bona Fide's defeat j in the bye Ripple
Bcored two points against her. while her
other opponents â Rollicking Airs, JImmIe
Anthony and Random Aimâ met defeat
without scoring. - '. .
Palo Alto and Sisquoc made short
courses of their work. "When they met
Geary's fast one wa.i made the choice at
2 to 11 As usual, the black and white
champion shot ahead, taking-a good lead.
When nearing the game he eased up, hes
itated, and second money was the best he
could see. Sisquoc took advantage of the
lull, bolted to the front, made a pickup,
and the stake was r.Is.
Random Aim was lucky in making sec
ond place. Jimmle Anthony made good
to those who playe-1 him for a repeater.
He beat America, a 2 to 1 favorite, then

HANDICAP DOUBLES WON
BY OOBNEIX AND SlkTITH
Match Between These Two and Col
lier and Crowell Best of
the Day.
The handicap doubles for the Davis
cups played j-esterday at the California
Club courts were aprain won in clever
style by Ray Cornell and Grant Smith,
this being their second consecutive win.
The other teams that have their names on
the cup twice are tne 'Whitney brothers
and Collier and Crcwell.
"The entry list Was rather small, but
there wa-s a large crowd of spectators on
hand, which was treated to some very
good tennis.
The first match of the dar was between
William Collier and Harold Crowell and
Paul Jones and Orville Pratt. The for
mer allowed the lattr.i odds of half thirty
and won in straight setsâ 6-2, 6-4. Jones
and Pratt were slightly off in their game,
while their opponents played up to their
usual good form.
The next match, between Ray Cornell
and Grant Smith and Collier and Crowell,
was the best one of the (lay, and brought
out the best tennl3 of the tournament.
Collier and Crowell allowed their oppo
nents odds of fifteen and were beaten
easily-6-2. 6-4.,
In this match Cornell played a very
steady game and ably assisted Smith, his
partner. Much surprise was occasioned
by the ease with which Cornell and Smith
disposed of their opponents. Had the
handicap been half fifteen the match
would probably have been much closer.
The final match was between Chester
Smith and Sidney Salisbury and Ray Cor
nell and Grant Smith. On account of tho
lateness of the hour the finals were made
two sets out of three, instead of three out
of five. Cornell and Smith allowed
their opponents half thirty, and after be
ing almost beaten finally pulled them
selves together and won out by a small
margin. The game put up by C. Smith
and Salisbury In the first two sets was a
surprise to everybody. Salisbury's accu
rate driving and the smashing of his part
ner enabled them to win the first set
handilyâ 6-2. With a lead -of 4-2 against
them in the second set. Cornell and Smith
braced up and by some fast work won the
Bet _6-4. The. youngsters seemed to fall
off in their game in ilie last set, which fell
to their opponentsâ 6-2. In the early part
of this match Cornell played very er
ractically. but in tit's last settled down
and played good tennis. Throughout tho
tournament Grant Smith played his usual
aggressive net game.
Next Wednesday nfternon there will be
a scratch singles tournament ror ladies at
the California Club courts, on the corner
of Bush and Scott streets. \

Ineleside, all the paraphernalia of a race
track has been loaded on tho cars and the
word given "from Ingleside to Tanforan.".
A nervous atmosphere hung" about the,
San Francisco Jockey Club offices . yester-.
day. Prince Poniatowski came ud, from
his Burlingame home, Alfred . Bouvier
drifted in and out with a patent perturba
tion of spirit, secretaries, ' clerks and
officers, all were there, full of mystery
and secret thoughts. First- the suggestion
went out that the jockey club would . fly
in the face of police authority and mayor
alty negation and race at Ingleslde Just
as if nothing had happened to the bill
passed by the local Supervisors. But soon
after there was more discretion than valor
Interjected into the plans, and It was. de
cided 'that the racing should be con
ducted at Tanforan. "â¢
Mayor Phelan has this statement to'
make to the public: "
MyÂ» position on Ingleside opening Is "clear/
and there is no necessity for a misunderstand
ing. . Â¦â¢. : '. â¢ ;
When Ingleslde was closed -two years ago
I approved the measure by signing it at once.
"Unrestricted betting had produced a crop of
embezzlements and crimes. The city treasury,
the United States internal revenue office, busi
ness houses and Individuals were its victims.
Later Tanforan was opened in San Mateo
County, and Emeryville, near Oakland, out
side the city's jurisdiction, yet patronized al
most exclusively by our own people. .
The present Board of Supervisors, In the.
same spirit of checking gambling, passed an
ordinance against bookmaklng on prize-fights,
which I approved, and Â¦ the**|jeople at' the elec-'
tlon ratified it. In my message to the board
in January. 1900, I. condemned unrestrained
gambling as a great public evil. Â¦ I stand by
that. ... - ; â¢ -
When the <juest#Â«n came up recently. I
favored in an authorized Interview and In
an address before .the citizens' meeting called
by me, the NÂ»w York law, which limits rac
ing to forty days. Here we have 180 days' ac
tual racing and S65 days possible. There was
no State law on the subject, and hence Emery
ville and- Tanforan were free to do as they
pleased. I told the meeting that the remedy
lay in the Legislature. I asked a prominent
citizen to move the appointment of a commit
tee at that meeting to visit Sacramento and
secure a limitation of the season as the best
practical remedy. He did not act, because
he was convinced at the meeting, I suppose.
that the evil should be suppressed, not regu- â¢
lated. I took the ground that we could afford
a: limited season v of racing In San Francisco,
but that we fhouhl secure the sport at the
least possible price to the community.
The bill was introduced in the Legislature,
and I awaited results. -It failed of support. â¢
I had but one Interview with the managers
of Tanforan,- and â¢ stated- theso views. Â¦â¢â¢ ; 1 in
sisted on a State limitation. I was surprised
when Supervisor â¢ Tobin introduced the -bill In
the Board 'of Â¦. Supervisors, and . absolutely ad
vised no one and kept my hands off In order
to be. perfectly free to act -when the bill came
to me,- should it pass. It passed the board. ,
Â¦Mr.-Bouvier, an unfortunate diplomat, called
on me, .and I told him to let me -know by
letter if the season could be voluntarily, "re
duced by agreement with the other track. . In
stead of that he tried to make engagrements
by telephone,' but I did not want to subject
myself to personal pressure, so insisted *on
written 'communications, -which' were not sent.
I' correctly assumed that no agreement could
be made, -and that the Legislature would not
act. so, consistently with all my public and
authorized statements, I decided to veto the
bill, and did so on Friday, the last day, giv
ing the racing people all- the. time possible
for me to.glve them. They were notified by
telephone at 6 o'clock Friday that the > bill
was vetoed. I consented to see Mr, ' Bouvier
that evening, and he. . unexpectedly brought
Prince Ponlatowpki and others, which merely
resulted In a long Interchange of views. They
knew â¢' at 6 o'clock that the bill was vetoed.
The conversation fieveloped" that the Prince
failed In negotiations for a short season with
the rival â¢ track owners, that the Legislature
was controlled by the Emeryville gambling in
terest and would not act. I told the gentle
men that my sympathy was with them as
between .factions, but I never let sympathy
Interfere with what I regarded as my duty
in the' premises and" wlÂ«i sound public policy.
When I left them, the Prince understood . that
I, would, not yield and recall the veto, if that
were possible, and he then declared what he
would do and which I do not feel'- at liberty
now to state, as it affects his private business.
He presumed a great deal in arranging for
the race Saturday, of which I had no knowl
edge until .Friday, midnight. Of course he
could race any time without bookmaklng.
The present conditions are these: Two tracks
within eaey dlstancÂ» of San Francisco have
now unlimited racing, bookmaklng and pool-
Felling, and run six months In the ,year. I
have been laboring to reduce the length of
the season, as a practical measure of partial
relief. What I desired was that both rival
interests should Â¦ agree to a short season. I
have done the best I could to effect that re
sult. I have had no communication directly
or indirectly with the managers of Emery
ville, leaving that to the Prince. As the case
stands .the rival tracksâ in Oakland and San
Mateo â are now on an equality, and Ingleside
Is closed.
Let it remain closed until the racing men
make some adequate concession.
In any event, the next Legislature will be
asked to cut them off with- forty days all told
In this vicinity. .
Here is another problem that confronts
the San Francisco Jcckey Club and must
be solved early to-day. It is claimed by
the club that only thirty-three out of the
thirty-Hve days allowed it by law under
the limitation measure have expired. But
the officers of San Mateo County think
otherwise. They declare the thirty-five
days of racing permitted by the limitation
measure have been exhausted, and as the
rescission of this ordinance permitting un
restrained racing combined with poolsell-
Ing does not go into effect until March 19.
the San -Francisco' Jockey Club . will
violate the law if it races at Tanforan to
day. The following showa what action
the officials of San Mateo intend to take:
REDWOOD CITY, March 17.â An at
tempt will probably be made to run races
at the Tanforan track to-morrow, al
though by doing so the management of
the association will be subject to arrest
and , prosecution for violating a county
ordinance. On February 5 of this year
an ordinance went into effect which
limited the racing eeason to thirty-five
days in each year. The thirty-five days
expired March 15. On the 4th of March
the Board of i Supervisors . passed an
ordinance which repealed that of Febru
ary 5, but which does .not go into effect
until the 19th, hence, until this last date
the ordinance of February 5 is in force.
By conducting their races to-morrow the
association will unquestionably be violat
ing the law.Â» P. H. McEvoy, chairman of
the Board of Supervisors, was seen at his
home in Menlo Park to-day. He stated
that it would be unlawful for races to be
run in the county to-morrow. When
asked if an effort would be made to stop
the races, he said that that was a matter
for the peace officers of the county to at
tend to. The -Jurisdiction of the Board of
Supervisors ends with the enactment of
the laws, he said, and the enforcing of
them is a matter that relates to another
department, namely, the peace officers.
Â¦What action they would take he did not
know. '
It is expected that Sheriff Mansfield and
Under Sheriff Butts will prevent any vio
lation of the law should such be at=
tempted. J
While the San Mateo officials figure that
the San Francisco Jockey Club has had
thirty-five days "of racing, the club offi
cials contend that they have had but
thirty-four days and that there is an
other day due them, which Is to-day.

when he vetoed .the ordinance.. psrraitting the reopening of JEngleside; "To Tanforan", is the cry, for it is

The automobiUsts took advantage of the
beautiful weather yesterday to take a run
out to Haywards and back. Three horse
less carriages went over on the 9 o'clock
creek boat to Oakland, the rendezvous be
tstg at the store of the Locomobile Com
pany, on Telegraph avenue. Here they
were Joined toy nine Oakland automo
biliFts. After repairing some tires that had
been punctured a start Â¦was made at 10:25
a. m.. Miss Beth Hamilton, with Judge
W. TV. Spinks of British Columbia, lead
ing. The chauffeurs went out along
TweJfth street, crossing Lake Merritt and
making good speed along a well bitumln
lzed road. Thence the route lay along
East Fifteenth street and out along the
San .Leandro ' county road, bordered by
preen fields and orchards, many of the
latter being in full bloom. At the Hotel
EFtudillo. In San Leandro, the autos took
water and the mobilists ginger ale â and
other things. Getting under way again a
pleasant run brought the whole party to
Haywards, where the chauffeurs took din
ner at the hotel. At intervals of half an
hour or thereabouts ail along the way
Hops of a few "minutes had been made
for the purpose of having pictures taken,
and at Haywards the whole dozen autos
were drawn up in a double line while P.
F. Rockett climbed the upper piazza of
an adjoining house and took a shot at the
party. At Haywards half a dozen of the
chauffeurs decided to return by the way
they had come, while the rest varied the
monopoly by going through Castro Valley
end climbing up the hills bordering one
Fide of Lake Chabot. The latter proved a
picturesque trip, but one that severely
tried the climbing capacity of the autcs.
and also their ability to force their way
through deep rvlobe mud. One or two of
the autos were mirod. but by backing and
getting on a good headway contrived to
emerge on the other side. The varying
rtewi of Lake Chabot from the ridge were
flr.e. and, wh<>n Fan Leandro avenue was
*afel>- reached, all agreed that the experi
ence and mud a<-quired were extremely
valuable. From San Leandro the party
reached Oakland without further adven
ture or mishap.
The following named made the trip to
Haywards s.nd back:
F. A. Hunt and L. T. Andrews. J. A. Meyer
and II. D. W. Schmidt, in the "Pioneer";

As the racing season now in progress
begins to show signs of age. several of
the big Eastern stables are getting their
belongings together and will soon be
beaded for Memphis, Tenn. The Schorr
string, in charge of Trainer Murphy, will
be snipped to the southern country . to
day, and in the same car Louis Ezell will
send along the pick of his stable, one a
two-year-old sister to The Lady, that
gives bright promise of being a "cherry
ripe" one. Later in the wec-js. probably
on Thursday Green Morris, with his
stable of cracks, will be started on the
journey across the hills. In this bunch*
are the great two-year-olds Cunard and
Golden cottage, the latter a very high
class fellow that will bear watching.
With the Morris string Tod Sloan will
load on the car his aristocratic timber
topper Credo, one of the very best ever
seen in these parts.
From, all accounts, Sam Hlldreth is
thoroughly disgusted with the local turf
aspect. Sam expended about $1000 in fit
ting up handsome quarters at Ingleside,
and then came the Mayor's veto. Hll
dreth said yesterday he would leave for
Memphis as soon as a car could be ob
tained. *
Peter Reilly, the bookmaker, together
with his crew, leaves for the Eastern
country to-day.
Tod Sloan will take his departure for
New York on Tuesday.
On Saturday last all of the records on
file of the American Turf Congress, of
which E. C. Hopper was secretary, with
headquarters at Lexington, Ky.. were
seized by F. F. Fowler. The latter is the
new secretary of the Western Turf Con
gress, and the action was no doubt tak
en to prevent the records from falling
â¢nto the. hands of the new Western
Jockey Club. Â¦ Â¦
Jockey Claude Burllnirame has been
notified" that h* ran accept mounts at
Oakland track. Claude is one of the best
light-weights riding here.

The cycling season opened in earnest
yesterday, all three local clubs holding
big read races to prepare their men for
the annual relay race in May.

mile handicap from Sen Leandro to Hay
wards. There were thirteen starters, of
whom ten finished. Fred West won fir?t
place from the 30-second mark, and H. D.
Bean won tho time prize from the scratch
mark. The club has a ten-mile event
planned for April 3.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen held in
unpaccd j sealed handicap over a . new
course, about eleven miles long, starting
at the cyclers' fountain in the park, vta

California Associated Cyclists will bo
held at the Olympic Club on Tuesday
evening, April 16.
The Nobles were victorious over tha
Golden Gates yesterday afternoon at
Recreation Park In a very poor exhibition
of the national sport. Although South
paw Tyson, who did the twirling for tha
winning aggregation had the opposing
team completely at hi? mercy at
every stage of the game, the re
sult was In doubt until the last
ball had been tossed over the
rubber. The work of Pitcher Tyson, both
in the box and at the bat, was spectacular
in the extreme. Out of four times at tbe
bat he negotiated four base hits, two Of
which were for two cushions. He alloweJ
but few bases on balls and struck out
ten of the Golden Gates. The stickwork
of Left Fielder Shea materially as
sisted in winning 1 the game. Thomas, at
third, made a brilliant one-handed stop,
for which he received an ovation from tha
gallery.
McMenomy. who officiated In the box
for the Golden Gates in the first part of
the game, received good support, but tn
the latter part he weakened and his team
went to pieces.
In the ninth inning, when the Xobles h*d
the game all but won. they lasped into a
state of lethargy and nearly forfeited thÂ»
victory- At this poinl the score stood 6
to 10. with two hands gone. Johnson went
to first on a hit. and .was followed by
Poulter. Both scored on a Ions fly to
center, which was missed by Ford
CJynes came home on a single by Shen.
The good work was. however, interrupted
when Egan flew out to J. Shea. The score:

MRS. MAYBRICK MAY
REGAIN VAST LANDS
Release From Prison of the American
Woman Will Probably Cause
. Trouble for a Syndicate.
LONDON, March 17.â Friends of Mrs.
Maybrick are not abating their appeals
for her liberation which they renewed on
the King's ascension, although so far the
authorities have made no favorable sign.
It fs a fact, a certain land syndicate on
the other side of the water stands to lose
several millions of dollars the moment
Mrs. Maybrick is released.
For some time prior to her arrest the
agent of the syndicate tried to purchase
an enormous area of real estate in which
Mrs.* Maybrick and her mother possessed
reversionary interest.' Having no occa
sion, to sell their rights they . refused, but
when the enormous debt of the defense at
the trial put the ladles in monetary diffi
culties the case was otherwise. By some
mysterious coincident the agent appeared
at a critical moment and offered to buy a
small portion of the land for iOOO pounds.
The deed was actually signed by Mrs.
Maybrick, without being read.' during the
time the Jury was deliberating on their
verdict. Eventually it was found that the
wnole area of land, estimated to be worth
' $8,000,000 had been technically included in
tho deed. Mrs. Maybrick's mother, who is
now practically penniless and Infirm, took
steps to invoke American law on behalf
of justice, and the title of the syndicate
has been suspended. Sir Matthew White
Ridley was appealed to to allow Mrs.
Maybrick to make an affidavit in prison
relating to this deed, but even this simple
privilege vras refused.

! Is the canal bill, which was passed by the
; Houxe at the first session, and which it was
i hoped the Senate would pass during the ses
sion Just closed. That it would have been.
!t is certain, had it not been for the complica
tion (trowing out of the Ilay-Pauncefote treaty.
The failure of England to accede to the amend
ment made by the Senate rendered It Impos
sible to take action on the canal bill without
a violation of our honor as a nation In dis
regarding a treaty which our constitution
makes the supreme law of the land. There-
I fore It became necewary to permit the bill
Â¦ to lapse with the session. If England does
not consent to the amended Hay-Pauncefote
treaty It will be abrogated and the canal .built
bv the United States.
Another bill of very great Interest to the
Paelne Court, because of the increase in Trans-
Pacific commerce which Is sure to occur, is
the ship subsidy bill. It 1*. I think, very
generally agreed that something should be
done to encouraee the American merchant
marine and to induce the establishment of
new lines to foreign ports under the American
flag that our roods may have behind them In
foreign countries the prestige which a great
fleet of merchant vessels glvee.
i Contained Objectionable provisions.
But' the bill introduced In the IIoura and
Senate contained provision* which did not
commend themselves to the friends of thÂ» prin
ciple and It was opposition to these particular
provisions which prevented definite action at
the past session. One of the moist Important
objections was the provision admitting forelxn
butlt ships to American registry and to ttie
.benefits ot the euhsidy, which was thought
would militate against the American ship
builder and would co far to defeat one of the
object* of the measure, which le to stimulate
shipbuilding In America. It was thought. â¢ too,
that the provisions of the bill would tend to
benefit existing lines rather than to encour
age the eeubllfhment of new lines so much
needed, bo that in reality the benefits to com
merce would not be no great as designed.
There were a few other objections which,
however, could have easllr been met by amend
ments", but those mentioned above appecr to
have been those which finally prevented action
on the bilf. '
I am Mire, however, that another bill will
be introduced at thr next session, and I hope
will be of such a character ae to commend it
eelf to all. The subject, however. Is a very
complicated one, and it- doea net surprise me
that the true basis of ruch a bill as Is needed
was not found during the short time that it
has been under discussion. This discussion,
however, has been more full at the past ses
sion than ever before, and I am hopeful that
the different problems arf now so well under
stood that as unobjectionable bill may be
framed.

The Alhambra has this week a lurid
melodrama of low life-in New York, called
"The Angel of the Alley." A large house
greeted the opening performances yester
day and seemed to enjoy the drama.
There are all the usual ingredients and
more â the make-up of the "Angel," abduc
tions,. murders, saintly heroines, black
browed villains and the like; but there is
also a tough girl, very well done by Belle
Darling 1 , and a May Irwinlsh figure, Kate
rlna Katzenjammer, cleverly played by
Miss LillJe Hall. The angel of the alley is
done by Miss Vera Hamilton, who is dis
tinctly worthy a better part. The scenes
are laid In the Bowery of New York and
at Sing Sing prison.
To-night begins the second and final
week of "The Telephone Girl" at the Cal
ifornia Theater. "The Telephone Girl"
has found much favor with the patrons of
the theater, anl the Nix eccentricities, ex
cellently acted by Harry Hermsen, are
nightly greeted with roars of laughter.
"The Highwayman" will hold the boards
at the Columbia Theater for yet another
week, with Lole Fuller as the attraction,
and will then give way to "The Little
Minister," a Frohman production, which
will be seen here for the first time.
The Tivoll will present to-night Stange
and Edwards' "The Wedding Day," when
Paul Steindorff. late conductor of the

MISSING CASHIER
CAUGHT AT LAST
At the risk of hfs own life George B.
Horsfull, who resides at 1103 Broadway,
Oakland, plunged Into the breakers near
the Cliff House yesterday afternoon and
saved James Graham, a youngster of 9
years, from drowning. Graham was wad
ing In the wash of the breakers, and not
appreciating his danger turned around to
watch the crowd on the beach. A giant
breaker rolled in, and before the lad could
take action to save himself he was thrown
from his feet and washed to the outer
breaker line. The 'lad screamed for help,
made a few frantic efforts to swim and
then went under.
Horsfull. who was on the beaca near by.
threw off his doat and vest and plunged
through the breakers. After reaching
deep water he was forced to swim some
distance before getting to the spot where
the boy went down. Suddenly youns
Graham was tossed to the surface. Hors
full with a few powerful stroke*
reached the lad's side, grasped him and
treaded water until thrown Into the shal
lower region Â»>y the breakers. The Jour
ney to thA beach was then easy.
Police Officer Jackson assisted Horsfull
to carry young Graham to the Seal Rock
House, where he was soon resuscitated.
He was then taken home by his father,
who resides at 625 Goiigh street. Mr. Gra
ham was so afforted over his son'a escape
from death that he could hardly speak,
and his only words were thanks to tho
lairs rescuer. Horsfull was complimented
many times for his heroic action, but he
refused to admit that he had done other
than a very ordinary act. Those who
witnessed the rescue of the drowning lad
thought otherwise, however.
Mounted Officer J. H. Cavanaugh
through quick action yesterday afternoon
stopped a runaway near the music stand
that might have resulted seriously. As it
was, the horse was so quickly brought to
a condition of calmness that It was not
deemed necessary to take It to the sta
bles, and the lady and gentleman who
were riding in the buggy were allowed to
proceed on their way. but not until tha
driver had taken an extra grip on his
lines.
An unusually large crowd enjoyed the
various features at the Chutes yesterday.
A regular St. Patrick's day crowd assem
bled at the pleasure resort and passed &
pleasant afternon. The crowd at Sutro
Baths was also larger than usual. Fol
lowing are the results of the aquatic con

MAN SAVES BOY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 17.â Reports of rich
discoveries of gold made since winter be
gan In the Nome district were received
here to-day In a letter from W. A. Aber
nethy, an experienced Alaskan miner, to
Charles Sinclair, hla partner, who has
spent the winter here.
Abernelhy, writing under date of De
cember 10, states that a few days pre
viously a miner arrived at Nome with
over fifty pounds of dust and nuggets
taken from a creek in the Arctic district
about Pixty miles north of Cape York.
John Dunsmuir, another prospector from
the same camp, brought in five pounds of
large nuggets and a considerable quantity
Of dust.
The largest nuggets weighed from five
to ten ounces each and the smallest was
half an cunce. The two men refused up
to the time Abernethy wrote to divulge
the name of the creek or its exact loca
tion.
Rich strikes on Wheeler Creek, a trib
utary of the Bluestone, were being fre
quently reported at Nome. Two miners
are said to have taken out $4000 from a
\Vheeler Creek claim in less than a week's
work. Another claim on the creek is said
to have yielded as high as $90 to the pan.
Remarkable strikes are also reported in
the Kougarok country, especially on
Quartz. Coffee and Creedon creeks, and
gcod finds in the Corwin coal fields, north
of Bering Strait.
It is to this part of the northern district
that the expedition sent out by Captain
Frank Tuttle and Sol G. Simpson of this
city will go in quest oi the rich gold lands
reported fifty years ago by sailors from
a whaling vessel.
Abernethy's letter conveys the first
definite information of gold strikes in and
north of the Nome District since tne close
of Bering Sea navigation. Sinclair and
others here who know Abernethy say he
Is absolutely reliable.

Fortune Hunters.
VICTORIA. B. C. March 17.â After an
a.bsence of two years cpent in prospecting
on the Flr.<21ay River, in Northern Brit
ish Columbia, W. C, Boyer reached here
to-day and reports that the next big Brit
ish Columbian placer find will be on the
Findlay. He and hie partner. H. A. Cu!
lin, left for the Skeene River In 1899, and
from the headwaters of this stream pros
pected to the headwaters of the Findlay.
When the ice opened they proceeded down
the latter 150 miles. On their way they
prospected every bar and tributary creek,
and Boyer is enthusiastic about the riches
to be obtained in some places.
That portion of the Findlay traversed
by the prospectors has been up to the
present time totally unexplored, the only
surveying: party ever employed on It hav
ing stopped at the Still Water, near Big
Canyon, under the impression that It was
Lake Thuda, from which the Findlay
takes Its source. Boyer says he found
mineralized veins everywhere throughout
the country, some quartz and float cop
per, but no free milling gold rich enough
to work at that distance from transporta
tion.

The delegation had secured the Insertion In
the sundry civil and river and harbor bills,
mainly through amendements to the bills In
the Senate, of appropriations for California
and, Alaska of nearly $2,000,000. but all this
Â¦nas lost when the bill was defeated by Senator
r S rter in the verv last hour of the session.
The appropriations effecting California that
thus failed are as follows:
Appropriations That Failed.

Much legislation that was passed by the
Finale failed In the House. Speaking of
this Senator Perkins said:
Several important bills were passed by the
Pirate, but failed In the House. One of very
prfat importance was that providing for the
â¢ rÂ«ction cf a new custom house in San Fran
cisco, on the site cf the present structure. The
!i!l introduced by me was pasted by the Sen
nte, appropriating Jl.WQ.OOO for construction.

Another bin of great Importance to com

mÂ» Â«n<l was passÂ«i by the Senate. It wu

The Howe Committee on Interstate Commerce,
which committee failed to report It back. I
rffered an amendment to the sundry civil bill,
appropriating KCO.'/O for makinsr and laying
a cable from San Francisco to Honolulu, but
the House of Representatives, having declined
to p& s * the bill that the Senate adopted one
vrÂ«r apo. this amendment was not agreed to.
Tbe bill Introduced by me. providing for the
mint in Pan Francisco, was also passed by the
Kenate and was reportPd back to the House
bv the Committee on AVeys and Means, but
was never brought before the House for a
vote. .
Cable Bill Defeated.
I r*tr*t exceedingly the defeat of the bill
providing for a postal cable to the Hawaiian
I*IandÂ». as I de*m Jt not only a tnÂ«u>ure of
rreat importance to the Government, but also
to the commercial Interests of our country.

In the pceond cession, but. In eplte of every
effort. It could not be brought up In the -HotiKe

have to be made to preserve these trees for

ment amor.* thos* lntcrffted In the matter In
California a* well as elsewhere. It waÂ» net
Â¦further pushed.
In view of the development of the mineral
oil Industry In California, the bill Introduced
In the Benate by me, authorizing the entry and
patentlnu of land* containing petroleum and
chiefly valuable therefor, vu Important, and
j r , r r> t that no action was taken on It owing
to the pressure of business at the short seÂ«.

The mineral land bill, providing for the pctr
reitatlon of the mineral lands from the agri
cultural lands, failed to r"Â»RS either Houi-e of
<~on*:res8 et thli Â«eÂ«elon. The miners are much
Interested In thin measure, and I am very
Korry the opporltion to 1U passage developed
so much rtrencth.
I think that the credit for the defeat of the
Jamaica reclproclay treaty is due to the Cal
ifornia delegation, which ehoved that the

waÂ« to eonclurtve that the Committee on For

Affaire and General Appropriations, I secured
an authorization for the Secretary of War and
SÂ«fptary cf the Navy to contract for the sup

It Is reported that Count Tolstoi, .who
ever since his excommunication ' has been
loudly cheered whenever he has made his
appearance, is taking an active part \ in
the, disturbances at Moscow, where the
situation is complicated by a strike of the
operatives of several largo^actories. .
Eight hundred students of the Univer
sity of St. 'Petersburg, virtually all re
maining here.- met last Friday and re
solved not to attend further lectures. The
police subsequently arrested sixteen. Four
hundred students of the Technological
School entered the courtyard of the Insti
tution ; to hold a motting; and* the police
inscribed all their names.. The Mining
Academy Is already entirely closed.
ST. PETERSBURO. March 17.â In con
seQuence of the riotous disturbances fol
lowing, the demonstrations promoted by
university students, the Government "has
proclaimed 1 a state* of siege at Odessa,
Kieff and Khartcoff. It is reliably report
ed here that a student died at Kharkoft
from injuries sustained in the disorders
of March 4 in that city. ': : *

Â¦Mr. Hill has been In NewTork for more
than a week in connection with this deal,
but so secretly were the negotiations con
ducted that the announcement of his ac
quiring control comes as a surprise. When
asked In New York a- few days ago
whether he was frying to obtain control
of the Burlington, he said most emphat
ically that he did not own and was : not
buying a share of the stock. This re
moved all suspicion, and the conclusion
was jumped at that the Pennsylvania
Company .was buying the Burlington
stock and ' causing its phenomenal rise.
But the Pennsylvania people" promptly de
nied the story. . ' ; Â¦

The Morgan and Harrlman Interests ob

Mr. Hill has been negotiating Â¦Â¦Â¦ for the

marked the beginning and culmination of
the deal.

BUSY DAY FOR OFFICERS
OUT AT THE PRESIDIO
Herzog visited Captain Seymour yester
day and requested the Chief of Detectives
to communicate with Colonel Rawles ask
ing for military protection. Herzojr says
he will close out his business, but he has
a quantity of pawned property that ho
wished to have redeemed, and wanteo
protection until such time as he was able
to dispose of It. Detective Reynolds wa3
detailed to confer with Colonel Rawles
and will visit the Presidio to-day.
Private James Budrow of Company I.
Thirty-sixth Infantry, who claims he was
robbed by Herzog, intends getting out a
warrant for the latter's arrest. Bud
row claims he was perfectly sober at the
time he was refused his change and of
fers a good army record as indicating that
he is a man of veracity.
The small sauad detailed to subdue the
mob arrived on a run and the trouble was
ended. The crowd coula not stand the
presence of a half dozen armed men and
a determined lieutenant and when the lat
ter issued the order to disperse the men
slunk away and went quietly to the:r
quarters in the Presidio.
Before the sruard reached the scene sev
eral stones had been hurled at Herzog's
place of business and it was apparent that
any moment might see violence and de
struction committed.
After retreat the men aro free until 11
p. m. Shortly after 7 o'clock the number
of soldiers increased about Herzog's store,
they forming into a number of small
squads. About 8 o'clock they assembled
in large numbers until fully 3000 men were
gathered together. ' Angry mutteringa
could be heard by the police officers and
they quietly dispatched a soldier for the
guard from the reservation.
The departure of Herzor somewhat
cooled the angry passions of the men. but
they were closely Â¦watched for the rest of
the day. Sergeant Harper, fearing trouble,
sent for- three additional men and sta
tioned them near the wrecked store.
I.ate In the afternoon the soldiers start
ed for their auarters within the reserva
tion, but as they could go and come at
will, a close watch was kept upon their
actions.
Herzog was finally extricated from his
dangerous position, and under the escort
of three police officers taken to the Union
street cars.
. The trouble of the preceding night was
resumed in the morning upon the appear
ance of the proprietor of the store. Hun
dreds of soldiers who ara still of the
opinion that â¢ Herzog robbed their com
rade stood in front of his place and when
he made his appearance rushed toward
him. With yells for a rope and crying
"Lynch him!" "Kill him!" "Burn his
house down!" they crowded around the
pawnbroker, and the police officers had a
hard time preventing the infuriated men
from carrying out their designs.
All day long hundreds of soldiers were
congregated at the corner of Greenwich
and Lyon streets awaiting an opportunity
to destroy the property or wreak personal
vengeance upon N;|T. lierzog, the pawn
broker, whom they charged with robbing
a comrade .. and whose Dlaco they had
wrecked the night before.' The oolice of
ficers on duty were oqwerless and could
do no more than reason with the angry
soldiers.
Three thousand angTy soldiers bent upon
doing mischief gave way to the authority
vested in a simile lieutenant and six pri
vates of the regular army last nigrht near
the entrance to the Presidio. For an hour
before the appearance of Lieutenant El
tinge and his guard of a 1 half dozen men.
the soldiers had been actinsr as If the
world was their own, but their turbulent
spirits were quelled at the sight of a few
determined men. They knew an order is
sued by the officer In command meant its
execution.
