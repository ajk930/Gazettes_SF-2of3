Facts Before the Court.
Facts : The flying â¢ squadron, consisting of
the Brooklyn. Massachusetts. Texas and Scor
pion, under the command of Commodore W. S.
Echley. U. S. 1C-. sailed from Key West about
6 a. m. of May 19, 1888, with orders from the
Navy Department and from the commander In
chief of the North Atlantic station to proceed
with dispatch (utmost) off Cienfuegos to cap
ture the enemy off that port, if possible, or to
blockade him. asd to make the blockade as
c1obÂ« as possible. -
The flying squadron arrived off Cienfuegos
on the morning cf May 22 and established a
blockade. During the day the ships lay off
'-the port at \-arious distances. In no particular
border. At night they formed In column of ves
sels, headed off shore.' and moved at only suf
ficient speed for keeping positions. The small
vessels performed picket duty inshore of the
Jarge chips.
Commodore Echley did not proceed with ut
most dispatch off Cienfuegos and block that port
as cloee as possible. At 10 Â«L m.. May 22. the
Pupor.t arrived at Cienfuegos with a dispatch
from the commander In chief dated Key West,
May 20. 1SOS. which Informed Commodore
F'-hley of the probability of the Spanish squad
ron being in Santiago de Cuba, and ordered

OrL Shown by Memorandums.
â² memorandum dated off Havana May 21,
The San Francisco Call.
1808, which directed Commodore Schley to
mask his movements In leaving Cienfuegos.
A memorandum which stated that a good
landing: place had been found by Commander
McCalla 13% inlles weft of Eavanilla Point;
that the Cubans had perfect knowledge of what
was eolns; en within Cienfuesos; that the
Cuban forces in the San Juan Mountains con
trolled the railway between Cienfuegos and
Trinidad, and that there were fair roads from
the landing places to Cienfuegos.
At 8:30 a. m., May 23, the Castine and the
collier Merrlmac arrived at Cienfuegos.
At ooon on the same date the British
steamer Adula was permitted to go Into Cien
fuegos.
At 7 a. m.. May 24. the Marblehead. Vixen
and Eagle arrived at Clenfueeos.
About 10 a. m. the Marblehead and Eagle
proceeded to the landing place 13% miles west
of Eavanilla Point, communicated with the
insurgents, landed stores for them, learned
that the Spanish squadron was not in the har
bor at Cienfuegos, rejoined the squadron at
3:30 p. m.. and reported to Commodore Schley
the Information obtained.
After the receipt of this Information Com
modore Schley wrote a dispatch to the com
mander in chief in which he stated: "I shall
move eastward to-morrow." He also wrote
a dispatch to the commandant? of the naval
base at Key West In which he stated: "As
It Is found impracticable to coal the Texas
from the collier here, where there Is so much
swell. I shall proceed to-morrow oil Santiago
de Cuba, being embarrassed, however, by the
Texas' short coal supply and her inability to
coal In the open sea. I shall not be able to
remain off that port on account of general
short coal supply of squadron, so will proceed
to the vicinity of St. Nicholas Mole, where the
water is smooth and I can coal the Texas and
other ships with what may remain In collier."
Fails to Communicate.
JCo work was. apparently, In progress on the
fortifications of Cienfuegos while Commodore
Schley was off that port.
No efforts were made by Commodore Schley
to communicate with the insurgents to dis
cover whether the Spanish squadron was in
the harbor of Cienfuegos prior to the morn
ing of May 24.
Signal lights were displayed on shore at
night May 22 and May 23, but Commodore
Schley had no Information which enabled him
to Jnteroret tbem.
Before sailing from Cienfuegos Commodore
Schley received reliable information that ships
could be coaled In the vicinity of Cape Cruz
and In Gonalves channel.
The flying squadron, with the exception of
the Castlne. sailed from Cienfuegos about 8 p.
m. of May 24, the heavy ships In column of
vessels, the light ships on the right flank and

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1901.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GALL BUREAU,. 1406 G STREET,
N. .W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.-
Blame and praise. This is the
verdict of the Schley court of In
quiry handed In to-night. It Is
more blame than praise, because while
Admiral Dewey. president of the court,
gives him all of the credit and glory for
the destruction of Cervera's fleet, as
senior In command at the battle/ and the
entire court finds that his conduct was
that of a man of courage in action, the
unanimous finding is; made that Schley's
conduct in the Santiago campaign prior
to his supercesslon Â«by Rear Admiral
Sampson was characterized by vacilla
tion, dilatoriness and lack of enterprise.
The Investigation, unique in naval an
nals and of great historic importance,
was intended to end the controversy
which has not only disrupted the navy,
but which has rent the entire country
Instead, further bitterness has probably
been added to the controversy, for while
Admiral Dewey gives It as his personal
and individual opinion that to Rear A.d
miral Schley belongs the credit of the
victory off Santiago, Rear Admiral Ben
ham and Rear Admiral Ramsay, two
junior members of the court, .declined to
append; their signatures to such an ex
pression. '

and Secretary Long's statement that
while Schley did his duty in. the battle
of Santiago as commander In chief of
the flying squadron, he lacked push, judg
ment and steadiness of purpose. But
Rear Admiral Schley has established, by
the opinion of Admiral Dewey, that he
was the hero of the battle of Santiago,
and in this he has confounded Rear Ad
miral Sampson, who attempted to claim
the credit for the Victory.

POINTS AGREED UPON
BY THE ENTIRE COURT
JJ DMIRAL DEWEY and Rear Admirals Benham and
jF^ Ramsay agree on these points:
That Schley did not obey the department's order of May 2$
to go with all haste to Santiago, find if the' Spanish Heet was
there and not leave* without decisive action. He; did not en
deavor to capture or destroy the Spanish fleet at the mouth of the
harbor May 28 and 29.
He did not use his utmost endeavor to destroy the Colon
while anchored at the month of the harbor on May 30.
The effect' of the hop of the Brooklyn was to lose the
distance and .position of the Viscaya and Colon. The loop was
made to avoid dangerous proximity with the Spanish fleet, ana it
caused the Texas to stop and back her engines.
He did an injustice to Lieutenant Commander Hodgson in
publishing only a' part of his correspondence.
His conduct prior to June 1 zvas characterized by vacilla
tion, dilatoriness and lack of enterprise.
His coal reports .were inaccurate and misleading.
His conduct during the battle of July 3 was self-possessed,
and he encouraged the offictrs and men to fight courageously.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.â "My honor has
been vindicated and I am satisfied with
the decision: cf the court."
This, was the only, comment Rear Ad
miral Schley would make after hearing a
synopsis of the two reports of the court
of inquiry. ,'. Schley I remained /at his
apartments at* the Hotel Richmond all
evening, evidently awaiting the report of
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Santiago was made with as much disi
patch as was possible while keeping the
squadron a unit.
"The blockade of Santiago was effect

"Commodore Schley was the senior offi
cer of our squadron off Santiago when the
Spanish squadron attempted to escape on
the morning of July 3. 1898. He was in ab

credit due to such commanding officer for
the glorious victory which resulted In the
total destruction of the Spant3h ships.

Admiral Schley came down Into the
smoking-room of the hotel about 8 o'clock
and stated that he had not received a
copy of the' report and suggested that it
would probably be mailed to him, so that
he would get it In the morning. He was
attired In dinner costume and puffed
carelessly at a cigar as he chatted with
a few friends.
Admiral Schley had Just finished an In

settled himself back in a large chair and

The coal supply of the vessels of the flying

FEW PEOPLE REALIZE ;
The Danger In That Common Disease,
Catarrh.
Because catarrhal diseases are so com-
mon and because catarrh is not rapidly
fatal, people too often overlook and ne-
glect it until some incurable ailment de-
velops as a result of the neglect
The inflamed condition of the membrane
of the nose and throat makes a fertUe soil
for the germs of Pneumonia and Con-
sumption, in fact catarrhal pneumonia
and catarrhal consumption are the most
common forms of these dreaded diseases,
which annually cause more than one-
quarter of the deaths In this country.
* Remedies for catarrh are almost as
numerous as catarrh sufferers, .but very
few have any actual merit as a cure, the
onjy good derived being simply a tempo-
rary relief.
There is. however, a very effective rem-
edy recently discovered which is rapidly
becoming famous for its great value in re-
lieving and permanently curing all forms
of catarrhal diseases, whether located in
the head, throat, lungs or stomach. -
This new catarrh cure is principally
composed of a gum derived from the Eu-
calyptus tree, and this gum possesses ex-
traordinary healing and antiseptic proper^
ties. It Is taken internally in the 'i'rm
of : a lozenge or tablet, pleasant ' to the
taste and 60 harmless ; that llttje children
take them with safety and benefit. - .
Eucalyptus oil and the bark are some-
times used, but are not so convenient nor
to palatable as the gum.
Undoubtedly the best quality is found in
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, which may be
found in any drug store, and any catarrh
sufferer who has tried douches, inhalers
and liquid medicines will be surprised it
the rapid Improvement after a few days'
cse of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, whk-h
are composed of the gum of the Eucalyp-
tus tree. . combined with other, antiseptics
which destroy the germs of catarrh in the
blood and expel the catarrhal poison from
the system.
Dr. Ramsdell in speaking of catarrh ttÂ».d
its cure says: t' After many experiments
I have givfcn up the idea of curing catarrh
by the use' of Inhalers, washes, salves cr
liquid medicines. I have always had the
1 best results from Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets; the red gum and other valuable anti-
eeptjes -contained in these tablets make
them, in myopinion, far superior to any
of the numerous catarrh remedies so c\-
terisively advertised." , The fact. that Stu-*
art's/ Catarrh , Tablets are sold -In : drug
stores under protection of a trademark
thould not prejudice conscientious physi-
cians sgalnst them; because their, un-
doubted merit and harmless â¢ character
make them a remedy which every catairh
sufferer may. -use with perfect safety ai-.ii
the prospect cf a permanent cure.'
For colds in the head, for coughs, ca-
tarrhal deafness and catarrh of the stom-
ach and liver, people who have tried them
cay tliat Stuart's .Catarrh .Tablets . are a
household necessity. / .... .' .

LAWYERS ARGUE
THE TIME AWAY
Lookout Lynching Case
May Last Through
the Winter.
Special Dlsr<atch to The Call.
AL.TURAS. Dec. 13.â The trial of James
W. Brown, the alleged. LooKout lyncher,
bids fair to last through* the entire win
ter. Each question asked of a witness
by counsel for the State brings nn o'j
jectlon from the defense. Then follows
nn argument over the point involved, the
discussion lasting from fifteen minutes to
upward of an hour. During these argu
ments Judge Harrington finds it neces
sary to excuse the Jury from the court
room, as the lawyers for the prisoner at
tempt to place before the twelve men al
leged facts and hearsay evidence that
has not yet been introduced through the
medium of witnesses. The patience of
the court is about exhausted, and there
are frequent clashes between Judge Har
rington and the defense.
The witnesses so far called have shown
marked reluctance toward giving testi
mony that might Injure the chances of
Brown. Singularly enough Justice of tlie
Peace Myers, whose examination wa3
continued to-day, had heard but one man
hint that there would be a lynching" in
Lookout, and that man had since died.
The next witness, however, declared that
only the day preceding the tragedy the
Justice had said to him thtrt he was
afraid the Halls and Yantis' would .. ber
strung up.
When the examination of Justice Myers
was resumed this morning the witness
swore that he had no idea or knowledge
that there was to be a lynching at Look
out. Pending argument on the objection
to the question which brought forth the
statement, the jury was excused from the
courtroom for forty-five minutes. Myers
said that the only man he had ever heard
advocate the lynching was the late W. D.
Morris of Lookout. He heard Morris re
peatedly declare that he would like to
pull at the end of a rope. Myers believed
that Morris was "talking to hear himself
talk," and dldÂ«ot give any weight to his
remarks. Morris was at one time elected
to the Legislature from this district, but
was of late months considered of unsound
mind. Myers said that after the lynching
occurred Morris bitterly denounced it and
said he would give twenty-five dollars
toward the prosecution of members of
the mob, because he was a friend of Cal
vin Hall.
Ira Cannon, Grand Juror and ex-Super
visor of Modoc County, swore that on the
afternoon of May 30, the day prior to
the lynching, Judge Myfers and himself
went riding and - that during the ride
Judge Myers spoke--Â«f a lynching ; and
said he was afraid something like that
might occur. He did not speak of Morr's
having threatened to hang the five prison
crs. *
j" E. Kresge, who lives near Lookout,
was called. At the beginning of Kresgo's
testimony Raker, for the defense, started
to make an argument on an objection and
the court excused the Jury from' the.
courtroom.- The argument lasted an
hour, after which the jury returned. -
Kresge said that on May 25 he with
others formed an arresting party. They
met trt his place and- Levanton asked him
to go. Kresge then detailed particulars
of the arrest of the Halls.

DEBTOR CAUSES
BANKER'S ARREST
William Beckman Re
grets the Lending of
Five Dollars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Dee. 11â William
Beckman, president of the People'a Sav
ings Bank, former Railroad Commission*
cr from this district and one of the most
prominent citizens of Sacramento, was
served by United States Marshal Shine
this afternoon with papers charging him
with felonious use of the malls. I'ock
inaji was brought before Township Jus
tice of the Peace Jay R. Brown and his
bonds were fixed at $2500. These were
promptly supplied by George W. Lorenz
and Al Folger, and the date for the tak
ing of depositions in the case was set for
Saturday, December 21.
So quietly were the proceedings con
ducted' that not an inkling of them be
came known , until to-night. The com
plainant in the case is the wife of Paul
Wickersham, who is represented as 1 a
writer on the San Francisco Wasp and
a clubman of that city. Mr. Beckman
was visited by The Call correspondent to
night and asked for a statement. He re
ferred his inquirer to his attorney. Clin
ton L. White, who recounted the" circum
stances leading to the filing of the charge
against the bank president.
According to White, Wickersham ac
costed Beckman in San Francisco in Sep
tember last, told him a story and bor
rowed from him $5, at the same time
promising to pay It back the next day.
He did not do so, however.
"Ordinarily," said White, "Mr. Beck
man would not care for the loss of a
mere $5 piece, but he was under the im
pression that in this particular instance
he was the victim of a case of
misplaced confidence and he was
particularly anxious to collect the
loan. In furtherance of this intention he
Bent letters and postal cards to different
places, in the hope . of reaching Wicker
sham, reminding nim of the debt. I think
he sent three letters, and five postal
cards. Instead of remitting the $5,
Wickersham sent his wife to the United
States Court in San Francisco and swore
to a complaint charging Mr. Beckman
with violating a United States statute.
"The complaint served on Mr. Beckman
recites three counts. It alleges that Mr.
Beckman, some time in October last, ad
dressed a postal card to Wickersham,
saying he had borrowed $5 and promised
to pay it and that he wanted him to da
so immediately. The next two counts
allege that Mr. Beckman sent Wicker-'
sham two more postal cards on the same
date, one in the care of the Wasp and
the other in care of the Bohemian Club.
These postal cards set forth, so it is al
leged, that Beckman had written him two
letters and twenty-five postal cards and
had received no reply and that he wanted
Wickersham to reply immediately, so as
to save Beckman from purchasing 100
more postal cards." ~ ' r?
It appears that the complaint is drawn
up under the United States statute, enact
ed in 1888.' to reach certain collection agen
cies, which used postal cards and wrap
pers upon which . to . Inscribe . demands,
which were generally of. a ' threatening
character. The extreme penalty attached
is 55000 fine or five years' .Imprisonment,
or both. " â¢ ,/ . ..
Mr. Beckman's : friends say that the
feature of the case which annoys him is
that the man who owes him the money
should seek to turn the tables on him in
such a manner. It is not charged 'that
there was any .threat, unless the .state
ment that' he would purchase â  100^ more
postal cards may be, construed as- such.;:

COLLIER'S CREW
SAFE ON ISLAND
Steamer Leaves to Pick
Up Seamen of the
Matteawan.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Dec. 18.â The lighthouse
tender Mansantta, Captain W. 12. Greg
ory In command, left last night for De
struction Island, forty-three miles south
of Capo Flattery and three miles oft tho
Washington coast, whe're It Is believed
the shipwrecked crew of the collier Mat
teawan Is awaiting rescue. On Tuesday
night the Manzanlta passed the Island on
her voyage from Astoria to this city and
noticed signals of distress being made,
apparently by some shipwrecked crew.
The weather was so stormy that it was
then impossible to reach land. Captain
Gregory decided to come to Seattle to coal
and then go back to the rescue. This
course he followed, departing again for
the island last night.
Several things led Captain Gregory to
believe that the stranded mariners on the
island were . the crew of the Matteawan.
It is not actually known .that the big
collier is wrecked as yet, but she is now
out twelve days â  f rdm Nanaimo to San
Francisco, and wreckage bearing the
ship's â  name - has come ashore south ; of
Cape Flattery. The fact that lends color
to the belief that the crew of the coal
carrier will be. found on the island is that
Second Mate E. C. Wilson of the vessel
was formerly a second mate on the Man
zanita and was familiar with the land-
Ings on Destruction Island. At present
there is a Government station, with four
employes, on the island, which is in close
proximity to where the wreckage bearing
the name of the collier was found by In
dians. -- ,
The Manzanlta should have reached the
island some time to-day and, providing
the weather allowed a safe landing, will
arrive at Astoria to-morrow. It is from
that point that the first news will come
as to the identity of the shipwrecked men.
Even if they are not from the Matteawan,
there is no question that they compose
the crew of some ship that has met grief
off the storm-swept coast during the past
week. â 
; "The signals," Captain Gregory ex
plained, "consisted of flashes from
torches, evidently in the hands of per
sons on shore, and made to 1 attract at
tention from the Manzanlta, the only ves
sel calling there regularly." |
j The steamer was turned around and the
captain beat about the island for some
time, but finding that . communication
with the shore was impossible, he came
on to this City. ' ' â '* 'â â 'â â 
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 13.â According to
advices received here the missing steam
collier Matteawan, which sailed from
Nanaimo on December 2 with 4986 tons of
coal/ was'last sighted by the crew of the
United States, lightship No. 67, stationed
off Umatilla reef,, on the afternoon of De
cembers... This was the day of the terrific
southeast gale, that caused bo much de
struction to shipping. The big cdlller sa
luted the lightship with three prolonged
whistles, and the crew of the lightship
said .that she was laboring heavily in the
storm, which hourly increased In vio
lence. '. .
1 The Matteawan's case is very similar to
those of the steam colliers Kewanaw and
Montserrat, which were lost off the cape
in a November gale seven years ago, both
vessels going down in the same storm.

charged with the murder of James Sey

this city on the night of May 13, to-night
returned a â¢ vrnlloi of not guilty, and tha
defendant was tet at liberty.
. Such a conclusion of the trial was gen
erally expected, the popular Impression
here being that from the evidence sub

Its case against Mrs. Bonine, The jury
was out less than five hours, retiring a
few minutes after 4 o'clock in the after
noon and reporting their verdict shortly
before 9 o'clock to-night.
The attendance In the courtroom when
the jury returned was limited to the
members of the bar, representatives of
the press and the employes of the court.
There was some little attempt at a dem
onstration of approval, but this was
quickly suppressed' by Judge Anderson,
who had previously warned the specta
tors against manifestations of any Char
acter.
Mrs.- Bonine was in court at the time
the verdict was returned, and with her
were her husband and her two boys and
several of her relatives, all of whom have
shown their sympathy for her by their
constant attendance during the long trial.
The jury was discharged, and Mrs. Bo
nine and her- friends left the courthouse
by a back door. .
Judge Anderson's charge to the jury to
day was very general In character. He
wound up by saying that the jury could
bring in any one of four verdicts, viz :
That of guilty as indicted, with capital
punishment; guilty, as indicted, without
capital punishment, which would mean
imprisonment for life; manslaughter the
punishment under which would be im
prisonment for a term of years, or, last
or all, a verdict of not guilty.
Mrs. Bonine maintained the calm de

CONTROVERSY HAY
GO TO CONGRESS
CALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, K.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â A further
investigation of the Schley controversy
by Congres3 is among the questions prom
inently discussed to-night. A resolution
of Representative Williams, presented in
the House and now before the Committee
on Rules, is the only measure in Con
gress bearing on the matter. This calls
for an investigation by a committee as'to
whether or not the Maclay proofs were
shown to Admiral Sampson and other
officers of the Navy Department. It does
not involve, except indirectly. Admiral
Schley's conduct.
Williams says there is only one object
of ihe resolution and that is to find out
if the Navy Department officials saw the
Maclay book before it wa3 published. He
thinks this should be done, and will press
his resolution. Representative MudcTs
opinion that Schley's friends will not let
the matter rest here is not shared by
many Senators and Representatives so far
as Congressional action is concerned. The
Southern Congressmen as a rule do not
anticipate an investigation as a result of
the findings of the court.
A group of Democratic members of the
House, while discussing the verdict of the
court, expressed the general opinion that
Admiral Dewey's minority report woula
be accepted as final by the large majority
of the American people. Leadlnsr mem
bers of the Senate and House committees
on naval affairs refused to discuss the
question of further Inquiry, giving as a
reason that they might later on have to
pass officially on the question.

This Course is from the Pea of tho Well
Known Authority, Osorje H. Powell.
[From "Success."]
Mr. Powell, who furnishes the matter
for the entire series, Is a man of untiring
energy and enthusiasm, having devoted
his entire life to the practical, theoretical
and artistic study of the subject. He is
conversant with the most successful
methods employed in the production of
effective advertisements, booklets and
auxiliaries which are of value in secur-
ing that most desirable element known as
publicity.
Mr. Powell is to-day considered by
those best competent to judge as one of
the most skillful planners and writers of
advertising: in America. Some of his
achievements are notable.
Entering the field In 1891, he quickly
revolutionized bicycle advertising and set
a pace that was never equaled. Later he
astonished patent medicine men by dem-
onstrating his ability to float a new arti-
cle and make it highly profitable the first
month.
Next came Mr. Powell's work in build-
Ing up the advertising department of one
of the largest woman's publications in
America, and In a year his methods added
nearly $50,000 worth of extra business, be-
sides materially Improving the quality of
the advertising.
About three years ago Mr. Powell es-
tablished himself in New York, and be-
sides making thousands of dollars fiom
another proprietary article of his own,
he has helped scores of others to win
through up-to-date publicity.
As a counselor and planner of - adver-
tising campaigns Mr. Powell stands first
among experts, and he is paid tha highest
fees by scores of our largest advertisers
with whom he Is in constant touch. There
isn't a week that he is not sought for in
pushing to the front stock deals or new
manufacturing enterprises.
To benefit hundreds who are anxious to
earn from $25 to $50 a week in advertis-
ing writing, and to supply advertisers
with competent he.n, Mr. Powell will' give
free Instruction to all who take advan-
tage of the opportunity. Address George
H. .Powell, lo* Temple Court, New York.

San Francisco. Cal,PLAN REVENUE
FOR PHILIPPINES
Lawmakers Submit Re
ports on the Tariff.
Measure.
Congress Urged to Educate
the People and Open
Commerce.
WASHINGTON. Dec 13.â The House,
after less than an hour's session, ad
journed until Tuesday. The bill to tem
porarily provide revenue for the Philip
pine Islands was reported by Payne and
by unanimous consent an order for the
consideration of this bill on Tuesday and
Wednesday next was adopted, the gen
eral debate to close at 4 o'clock Wednes
day, when the bill will be placed upon
its passage.
The majority report on the Philippine
tariff bill cayÂ«:
This bill Is designed to raise revenue for the
government ana benefit of the Philippine
Archipelago. It is intended to restore the
6t&tus which existed prior to the late decision
of tha Supreme Court in "the diamond xinrs
cue." Prior to that decision the Government
hÂ«4 been collecting duties on goods coming into
the United States from the Philippine Archi
pelago at thÂ« same rates as those provided in
our tariff laws for like articles imported from,
forelgrn countries. The court holds that the
Philippine Archipelago is not a foreign coun
try, and. therefore, the general tariff law does
not apply. This bill extends the rate now ex
isting upon Imports from foreign countries to
articles brought In from the Philippine Islands.
In the Philippine Archipelago the United
States Philippine Commission prepared a tariff
act alter much care and study. The chief ob
ject has been and .is to raise euf flcient revenue
to support a government in the Philippines, to
provide amply for the education of the people,
to open up the highways of commerce, both
foreign and domestic, and, to provide ample
police force for the preservation of order.
These different forms of tariff in force there
Jiave produced a surplus after paying the ex
penses of the government. This bill proposes
In the first section to make this Philippine tariff
a part of the statutes of the United States.
Money Greatly Needed.
The necessity for a continuance of revenue
which ehall be both ample and certain is im
perative. If we continue the police and con
stabulary system which has been Inaugurated
and which is doing eo much to restore and con
serve order in the islands it will call for a large
increase in appropriations. We have enrolled
l.%0,000 school children In the public schools. Of
this number more than one-half are without
any school house accommodations. It Is nec
essary that we build suitable houses at once.
Ten thousand adults were at last accounts en
rolled for night schools, and we are told that
this number has since increased probably to
at least 35.C00. These people, anxious to learn
our language and to better their mental con-f
ditlon, must be amply provided for. Four
thousand teachers have been employed, nearly
all of them recently, and their salaries must
be paid. This great work of education must
not be crippled, even for a short time, for lack
of funds.
Our Government has gone to work systemat
ically through the commission for the improve
ment of the harbor at Manila. They have let
the contract, after a public advertisement and
competitive bids, to the lowest bidder. This.
contract calls for the expenditure of three mil
lions of dollars in the near future. Roads are
bping constructed, and the building of roads In
this tropical country are expensive. These are
but a few items of expenditure which are im
perative. All these expenditures are preparing
the way for a reduction of the army and In the
end will prove of direct benefit to the taxpay
ers of the United States.
Trade Among the Islands.
The bill also provides for the collection
of tonnage taxes on vessels plying be
tween the ports of the United States and
the Philippine Archipelago. It further
provides that "vessels not of the
United States may ply between these
islands, notwithstanding our coastwise
navigation laws, until the . first day ot
January, 1505, when it is believed these
islands may safely come under the op
eration cf uur present statutes and ves
sels only cf the United States be em.
ployed in our commerce with them."
Representative Robertson presented to
the House the minority report on the
Philippine tariff bill, signed by all the
Democrats of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, except Robertson. The report
says in part:
The measure Is but another step In the well
marked line of Imperialism. It is "enacting; a
policy of pure colonialism and the worst form
of that policy. We are opposed to our Govern
ment attempting to hold territories as colonies
and treating the Inhabitants therof as subjects
and imposing upon them a government of
force. This is the method of the empire instead
cf that of the republic. We oppose the whole
policy of the majority in dealing with the
Philippine Archipelago. We believe that ln-
Ftead of the effort they are making to 6et up
and hold permanent colonies there we should
long since have Inaugurated a policy assuring
to the people of those islands stable govern
ment and their ultimate independence.

POLICE AWAIT
HIS AWAKENING
Slumbering Hypnotist
Has Legal Surprise
in Store.
Former Wife 'Says That He
Retains Her Share
of Receipts. . ';
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA. Neb.. Dec. 13.â Carl Atheno,
a hypnotist, lies in his coffin, having com
pleted five days of this week in self-im
posed sleep. Two wives are waiting for
his awakening, one with a warrant for
his arrest. Since the financial success of
the slumber was assured Mrs. Lottie Mc-
Manigle of Kansas City has appeared to
contest the right of the present Mrs.
Atheno, now keeping watch beside the
coffin.
Mrs. McManigle says she was married
to Atheno three years ago in New York
and that the hypnotist has since changed
his name for esthetic purposes. Although
Atheno has lately cleared $1800 by his ex
periments. Mrs. McManigle says she has
been obliged to get along with only $5 as
her share. She has sworn out a warrant
charging Atheno with abandonment and
is only deterred from Including blgainy
In the complaint through the difficulty of
locating the second Mrs. Atheno's mar
riage record. The reigning Mrs. Atheno
says she is Atheno's lawfully wedded wife
and that all will be explained satisfactor
ily when the sleeper wakens.
For three days Atheno rested beneath
six feet of ground. He was disinterred,
however, by order of the Mayor, who
feared that the extreme cold weather
would convert the apparent corpse into a
real one and that the city might thereby
lay itself open to a damage suit. Atheno
now occupies a well-heated grave in a
hall. Near the bier sits a policeman ready
to arrest Atheno the moment he regains
consciousness. r ..

CHILE, VEXED BY MORE DELAY,
SENDS ARGENTINA A LAST NOTE
Thousands of Troops : of One of the Quarreling Republics in
South America Are Reported to Have Been Ordered Out and
in Readiness to Take a Quick Part in the* Possible Hostilities
UENOS AYRES, Dec. 13.-Accord
ing to â¢ the latest advices from
the- Chilean capital, Secretary of
Foreign Affairs Senor Tanaz has
tendered to the Argentine Minis
ter, Senor Portela, a new proposal for a
settlement of the dispute.
It is understood that Chile will not
make another proposal if this new one is
rejected by Argentina. In case Argen
tina rejects the proposal a view will.be
taken that peace with Chile is , not de
sired and that war is acceptable. \
The Argentine army has now been in
creased to 60,000 men. It is believed that
with the police the total ' force will
amount to 80,000. Chile is mustering her
forces. - :
A dispatch from Santiago says that the
Brazilian. Minister to-day visited Presi
dent Riesco and tendered the good offices
of his Government, but that President
Riesco thanked him for the offer and de
clared that mediation was not necessary.
He added that the dispute would be set
tled amicably between the two govern
ments. Official reports give the follow
ing account concerning the offer of medi
ation by the United States:
The United States Minister in Santiago
informed his Government that President
Riesco was disposed to accept mediation.
Secretary Hay thereupon Instructed Min
ister Lord here to extend his good offices
to Argentina. Minister Lord yesterday
conferred with the Foreign Minister,
Senor Alcorta, who declared that he did
not believe it opportune to accent foreign
mediation at the present time.
The Tribuna, President Riesco's organ,
strongly denies the truth of a dispatch
sent to the London Daily Telegraph from
Washington announcing that the Argen
tine Minister, Senor Garcia Merou, ! re
quested the mediation of tfle United
States. The paper says the Argentine
Minister in Washington never did such a
thing.
Brazilian and Uruguayan papers declare
that neither country could remain neu
tral in case of war, in view of the'impor
tance of the interests which would be af
.fected by the struggle.

embarked upon a crusade to drive the
tiger from his lair in Redding. She has
caused the arrest of Bemis brothers, on
a charge that they maintain a gambling
game upon their premises. The affair
has caused a tremendous sensation. It
was the outgrowth of City Trustee Cline
schmidfs love, for, gambling and his
wife's opposition thereto.
No one was more surprised than the
City Trustee when the arrests were
made. H. A. Bemis is a guest of the
Temple and a close friend of Cline
schmldt. The latter implored his wife
not to press her complaint, but she Is
inexorable. He has now asked the two
brothers to plead guilty and allow him
to pay their fines. Clineschmidt denies
that he has lost money through gambling,
declaring that he is ahead of the game.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
day's date says: "The alarm manifested
in Argentina Is declared in Chilean offi
cial circles to . be unwarranted. In the
opinion of the Government the boundary
dispute will not justify a rupture."
A news agency here this afternoon re
ceived a dispatch from its . office at
Buenos Ayres, dated 11 o'clock this morn
ing, confirming a dispatch from Buenos
Ayres last night, announcing the calling
out of the Argentina army reserves, and
â adding that at the request of the Gov
ernment the*Chamber of Deputies had
sanctioned a bill setting aside the conver
sion fund to be used for the national de
fense. Continuing, the dispatch from
Buenos Ayres sa^s:
"The, report that fhe United States will
offer its good offices is confirmed. At
Chile's request the American Minister has
sounded the- intentions of the Argentina
Government. Brazil has offered, media
tion also. It was announced here that
Chile has called out 15,000 men, but the
news is questioned, because, according to
the officials here, Chile does not possess
the means to equip and move such a body,
of men. Much anxiety prevails here in
view of the fact that a decisive conference
on the boundary dispute and other mat
ters Is to take place at Santiago to-day.
Public feeling is very strong.
"Senor Anchorena has offered to bear
the expense of a regiment during the en
tire ' campaign, and patriotic ' offers of
various descriptions are arriving from all
parts of the country. Nevertheless, in
certain quarters, the opinion is persistent
ly held that war between Argentina and
Chile is improbable."

,W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.âPan-Amer
ican circles in Washington are In a fever
of anxiety to-night as a result of the con
ferences held to-day in Santiago by the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile and
the Argentina Minister. 'Senor Infante,
Chilean Charge d' Affaires, is confident
that war will not occur. His confidence
is based upon . this dispatch, which
reached him to-day from the Chilean
Minister for Foreign Affairs:
"The alarming reports published .by the
press are all without foundation. The
Government of Chile is confident that the
conference which will take place to-day
between the Minister for Foreign Affairs
and the Argentina Minister will result in
an amicable settlement."
Senor Infante said that this' message is
in line with many others which he has
received. â  .

Dupe of the Zion Leader Tells How
He Was Bunkoed Out of a
Fortune.
CHICAGO, Dec. 13.â Gaping crowds
thronged Judge Tuley's courtroom and
the adjacent halls to-day, curious to hear
disclosures against "Dr." John Alexander
Dowie in the suit for the appointment of
a receiver for his Zlon lace industries.
Samuel" Stevenson was on the stand most
of tr>e morning, and continued his testi
mony charging Dowie with defrauding
him of large .sums of money. Letters from
the "General Overseer" to Stevenson were
read and created a buzz of comment. The
plaintiff's testimony tended to show that
"Dr." Dowie used honey words and a
show of considerate feeling to induce
Stevenson to part with his money, but
that later when Stevenson learned that
Dowie claimed entire ownership in the
lace industries, Dowie's attitude toward
him turned to one of abuse. The plaintiff
testified that because he demanded his
rights in the business transaction Dowie
had abused him from the pulpit of Zion
Tabernacle and had unmercifully flayed
him through articles in Dowie's "Leaves
of Healing." . :

always entertained the belief that peace
â¦ill be ' preserved and I see no reason to
change that view." - \. *. â,_â
Senor Infante denied to-day that . Chile
is endeavoring to purchase warships m
the United States: He said that reports
to this effect probably arose out of the
efforts*, of private firms to buy warships
in the hope of selling them to Chile. It
is learned from an authoritative source
that Chile has. been negotiating for men
of-war in Japan, but it is not known that
her efforts have been suceeissf ul.
No word has been received by the State
Department from Minister Lord at
Buenos Ayres \n relation to . the attitude
adopted by Argentina to . the intimation
given to I her that the United States is
prepared to exercise Its good offices,
Chile having expressed willingness that
they should be used. Argentina will un
doubtedly refuse to permit mediation, be
lieving that a settlement should be effect
ed directly between herself and Chile.
If war occurs it will not be so much over
the question of where the boundary shall
be placed as to Whether Argentina or
Chile shall be the dominant power of
South America.

SANTIAGO DE CHILE, Dec. 13.â A
contingent of the Chilean reserves has
been called to arms. It numbers about
50,000 men. No movement of the. military
forces under arms has occurred, how
ever. Everything is quiet here in expecta
tion of the announcement of Chile's an
swer to Argentina, which, according to
public opinion, will be firm and serene.
The Brazilian Government has proffered
Its amicable mediation in the Argentina-
Chile ' dispute. It would seem here that
this action will not be necessary, as both
the Argentina and Chilean governments
hope to come to terms.
LONDON, Dec. 13.â The Associated

that the Chilean reply to the representa
tions of the Minister of the Argentine
republic to Chile was presented to-day
Confidence is expressed by the officials
here that the basis for a settlement pro
posed will lead to a satisfactory arrange
ment between the two governments.
The Daily Mail has 'received dispatches
from Valparaiso and Buenos Ayres ex
pressing the belief that peace will be pre
served and stating that Great Britain has
notified both the Argentina and Chilean
governments of her willingness to medi
ate if requested to do so. The Chilean
State Council, the dispatch adds, recom
mends that the strength of the navy te

YEARS OF HIS
LIFE A BLANK
Prank Strong Victim of
Peculiar Lapse df
Memory.
Missing Mississippi Lawyer
"Comes to" in a British
Columbia City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, - Dec. 13.â The
story of Franklin Strong, who was lost
four years and "found himself" yester
day in New Westminster, promises to be
at least a nine days' wonder. His experi
ence was a strange one. Four yeara^ago
he left his home to go to his office in
Aberdee.n, Miss.; in the regular course of
business. He remembers nothing after
that until he came to himself on Tuesday
of this week on Columbia street. New
Westminster. He was living In Aberdeen
four years Sago, and where he has been
and what ne has been doing since then
he does not know. The period was a
blank to him, and, strangely enough,
when his senses returned he remembered
only the moment when four years ago he
was walking down to his ofnee in Aber
deen. ,
Another peculiar fact is that, although
a lawyer with a good education. Strong
was another man since 1S97. From the
appearance of his hands he has been en
gaged at hard manual work and evidently
his education and attainments were of lit
tle use to him. . v - . â¢â¢â â ;
Strong seemed surprised when Dr.
Boggs tola him that he was in â  New
Westminster, and not in. the State of Mis
sissippi. He appeared to be in good
health, but complained that he had lost
money in miningâ where he could not re
member. He asked about President Mc-
Kinley and was horrified to learn of the
martyr's death. He said he remembered
something about the Cuban war. but hajfT
no idea how It had ended, and, so far as
the Boer, war and other important events
were concerned, his mind was a blank.
Strong asked for no assistance from
either Dr. Boggs or Dr. Kendall. Dr. Ken
dall offered to pay for his bed at a hotel,
but the man refused. He said that he
would go to the police station and he in
sisted on having his own way in that re
spect. He spoke several times of the
horror he had of the publicity that he
would attract when the story of his
strange experience became public. He
knew that it would attract attention be
cause ne remembered the notoriety he got
when a lad of 16 years. At that time he
had a lapse of memory and wandered
.away from home. He came to himself
three weeks afterward and found himself
150 miles away from his abode.
Strong was put under no restriction and
to-day went for. a walk. Since then no
trace of him has been discovered.
PHILIPPINE STOCK

Secretary Wilson Guards Against tho

mal Diseases.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â The accept
ance of Andrew Carnegie's gift of $10,000,
000 for educational purposes was dis
cussed Informally at the Cabinet meeting
to-day, but no definite conclusion was
reached In regard to it, and probably will
not be for several days.
The Cabinet also discussed a special or
der subsequently promulgated by Secre
tary Wilson prohibiting the landing at
any ports of the United States; Hawaii
or any of the dependencies of this Gov
ernment of any livestock of any kind
from the Philippine Islands. The order
takes immediate effect and is due to the
prevalence of infectious animal . diseases
in the Philippines.
It was announced after the meeting
that J. H. Colbert had been selected by
the President for United States Marshal
for the Southern District of the Indian
Territory, vice John Hammer, whose
term of office expires January 19. Col
bert was a member of Roosevelt's Rough

Hay Will Be the Orator.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â The Joint
committee of the two houses of Congress
appointed to make arrangements .for a
memorial service In honor* of the late
President McKlnley held a meeting to
day and decided to invite Secretary of
State John Hay to be the orator. This
selection was made upon a motion by
Senator Fairbanks, who briefly addressed
the committee, speaking feelingly of Pres
ident McKinley, referring to Secretary
Hay's fitness for the task and outlining
precedents. The date and time â  for hold
ing the service will be fixed later. . *

BERLIN, Dec. 13.â The most recent In

cants for the same number of vacancies

TURNS WRATH
ON UNCLE SAM
Venezuela Displeased at
Attitude of this
Nation.
Gerieral Uprising May Occur
in the Little Re-
WILLEMSTAD. Island of Curacao.
Dec. 13. via Haytien cable.â There has
been a halt In the exchange of communi
cations between Germany and Venezuela,
owing to the publication in the newspa
pers of Caracas of cable dispatches from
the United States setting forth that the
Government at Washington will not op
pose any steps which Germany may take
to enforce her rights in Venezuela, with
the exception of preventing the annexa
tion of Venezuelan t'erritory. .
As a result the newspaper attacks on
Germanuy have ceased, but the semi-of
ficial papers are now attacking the
United Mates, saying that Washington,
in authorizing Germany to take action
in her dispute with Venezuela, looks upon
the latter country as being part of tha
territory of the United States.
It is believed here that Germany at the
end of the present month will taKe steps
to obtain a due acknowledgment of her
claims for $2,000,000 arising from losses
sustained by German citizens during the
last revolution here and ..disallowed by
Venezuela, who answered last year that
Germany should present her claims be
fore the special Venezuelan courts ap
pointed to pass upon such matters. But
Germany^ the United States, Great Brit
ain and I'"rance refused to appeal to these
courts. Italy alone, being bound by a
former'treaty, was obliged to present her
claims to the Venezuelan courts. The
claim of the Disconto Eank of Berlin will
probably be included In the claims pre
sented by Germany.
The situation in Venezuela Is critical
and fears are expressed of a general up
rising there in January.

WINTER SPORTS AND PASTIMES INTEREST DEVOTEES
EQUESTRIANISM
IN THE PARK
GROWS POPULAR
Automobile Fad Makes No In
roads on Ranks of Horse
Loversâ San Mateo Hunting
The recent horse show In ICew York was
the most successful ever held there and
refutes the claims of the automobilisbs
that the horse will be relegated to ob
scurity either as an animal for pleasure
driving or for utility. The same claim
was made when cycling had apparently
led captive the young and the old, the
rich and the poor. â¢
To-day the show and parade of the bi
cycle is at an end and the wheel is play
ing its utilitarian part in the world with
out the glitter and pageantry which
marked its use at the height of its glory.
The automobile will always be more
costly than ite lowly relative, the
bicycle, and can never attain the popu
larity which marked the vogue of the
latter. For one reason the American
roads are against its development. When
the manufacturer turns out a machine ca
pable of attaining a speed of more than
liity miles an hour its owner can find no
stretch of road over which he can travel
with safety at any such rate. In France
this is possible, and in England and Ger
many it is also . possible, although in a
lesser degree.
The horse has stood the test of time
and to-day is more firmly Intrenched in
the affections cf the people than it has
been in years. This was shown in the
monster sale of standard bred trotters in
New York some weeks since, when a
half million dollars was paid for light
'.. harness horses. It is shown in this city
in the increased number of equestrians
and drivers seen In Golden Gate Park
throughout the week, and especially on
â¦Sunday. The riding academies are turn
ing cut accomplished horsemen and horse
women by the score and interest in the
healthful pastime is steadily on the in
crease.
The Park Commissioners have done
much to foster this by building bridle
paths through picturesque parts of their
domain. The paths are soft under the
horses' feet and wind in and out, reliev
ing the tedium of a straight, hard road.
The San Mateo County Hunt will meet
at 2 o'clock to-day at Uncle Tom's Cabin,
on the San Bruno road. Next Wednes
day, the 18th inst., the meet will be at
the Dairy, Millbrae, at the same hour.
On Saturday, the 21st. hounds and hunters
Trtil rendezvous at San Carlos station on
the Southern Pacific Railway.
Last Saturday morning the hunt met
at 10 o'clock at Moormeads, Fair Oaks,
the home of J. J. Moore, acting master,
The scent led through the Selby property
to Redwood City, where there was a
check. Thence the run was in the rear of
J. L. Flood's estate to Palo Alto, where
there was another check. Resuming the
chase, the hounds led the way over the
Payne lands Into the Hearst estate, and
thence Into Bedding's property. There
were several stiff fences, and In the
course of the run J. Athearn Folger, J.
J. Moore, Charles Dunphy and Parker
Whitney came down. Owing to the soft
ness of the ground they suffered no se
rious harm. After the morning's sport
the members were entertained at luncheon
by -Acting Master J. J. Moore. Among
these who followed the hounds were J. J.
Moore, Harry and Mrs. Howard, Walter
S. Martin, Charles Dunphy, J. Athearn
Folger, Jeff Moore. Walter and Mrs. Ma
gee and Parker Whitney. On Wednesday
last the hounds met at Laurel Creek.
Horses selected for hunting purposes
Bhould be patiently and thoroughly
trained to lead over any reasonable Jump.
They should be led over "trappy" places,
as an occasional fall will make them
careful. A small trench on the take-off
side of the fence has a most beneficial
effect on their education. A young horse,
thoroughly trained to lead over fences,
inay be ridden with hounds at short no
tice. This training of a hunter is always
& labor of lore for a hunting man. A
long, plain snaffle bit of medium sub
stance, with double reins stitched, not
buckled in, Is the favorite in the Irish
hunting field. The lower reins should pass
through the martingale. .The fashionable
hunting bridle, however, is the bit* and
braddoon.

one, as it is practically certain that yice-
Csmmodore E. F. Sagar will receive the
nomination for commodore, while Thomas
Jennings, part owner of the sloop Speed
well, will be nominated for vice-commo
dore. The office of port captain will con
tinue to be filled by. John H. Keefe, that
of treasurer by C. L. Barrett and that of
secretary by J. C. Brickell. It will be
necessary to select a yachtsman to fill the
vacancy left by the retirement of Com
modore H. D. Hawks from the board of
directors. The next event "among the
Corinthians will be the annual dinner on
New Year's day. The annual meeting and
election of officers will be held on the last
Wednesday In. January next. â¢,*
The California Yacht Club at the last
meeting of the directors appointed August
R. F. Brandes, E. Boquet and W. M.
Ramsey a committee to prepare the list
of nominations for officers to serve dur
ing the coming year. If Commodore S. S.
Marshall will not consent to succeed him
self, it is likely that Vice-Commodore C.
E. Clark, owner of the yawl Gypsle, will
take the ofHce. It is not at all certain
who will receive the nomination for vice
commodore, but it is likely to be one of
the following yacht owners: George E.
Miller of the sloop Occident, Dr. R. F.
Miller of the sloop Lapwing, R. Vincent
of the sloop Alert or E. Boquet of the
sloop Hope. If Vice-Commodore Clark is
selected as commodore it is probable that
A. R. F. Brandes, who lives in Oakland,
will be chosen as secretary, as it is de
sirable that these two officers should re
side on the same side of the bay. G. L.
Wakeman, the present secretary, who is
a clerk in the Bank of California, finds he
cannot satisfactorily fulfill the duties of
secretary- Allen M. Clay of the sloop
Pactolus will continue to hold the office
of port captain, and John T. Carrier,
owner of the sloop Jessie E, will retain
the office of measurer.
Cricketers Seek a New Field.
At the meeting of the California "Cricket
Association held on Monday evening Cap
tain John Metcalfe's prizes were present
ed to the winners. Harold B. Richardson
received the bat for the best batting aver
age In association matches during the
past season and Bert Bird the bat for' the
best bowling average. In the absence of
the donor. President Edward Brown pre
sented the prizes, commenting on the ex
cellent work indicated by the averages.
The pennant for the highest percentage
of matches won by any club was awarued
to the Alameda Cricket Club.
President Edward Brown, speaking- in
support of the remarks of A. E. Acklow,
said he hopes that means may be found to
provide the - cricketers of San Francisco
and neighborhood with a ground '. really
suitable for the gameâ level, well turfed,
inclosed with a substantial fence and pro
vided with a pavilion for the comfort of
tha players and spectators. The president
believes such a ground would add greatly
to the enthusiasm of cricketers, and the
quality of the game would be improved
and the number of men playing it wou'd
be Increased. He will appoint a commit
tee of five to investigate the chances of
carrying out the plan. If the committee
reports favorably a Ground Association
will be formed, and the British residents
of San Francisco and neighborhood asked
to support it.
The Alameda Cricket Club seemed like
ly to find Itself without any delegates to
the California Cricket Association. J. J
Motiartyis in' Southern California and
R. B, Hogue expects to leave for Austr â¢-
Ua. early In the new year. To guard
against the loss of representatives in' the
association . the annual meeting of .'the'
club, which was not held until March,
1901, has already been held for 1902, Har
old Ward and H. W. Brown having betin
chosen as delegates. Harold Ward ha.?
been accepted already in lieu of J. J,
Morlarty, and H. W. Brown will step Into
Hogue's place on the latter's departure.
Inasmuch as it will not be possible to
procure and put in order a : new cricket
ground in time for next season's play, it
is proposed to do some work upon the old
ground al Webster street, Alameda. Dur
ing the winter it will be plowed and grass
seeds sown, so as to improve it a little at
least. As the country clubs play some
matches on the Alameda ground, it is pas
posed the association contribute toward
the expense of Improving it. This, how
ever, will not be done without the consent
of the country clubs, which have been in
formed of the proposed outlay by the sec
retary of the association and requested to
express their sentiments. .:

Warren Gregory, 2 up I to play on Tues

As Far as His Fight Went
He Showed All His Oldtime
v Agility and Hitting Towers
The showing made by Kid Lavigne in
his fight with Tim Hcagerty In Oakland
on Thursday night was a surprise -to the
admirers of the Saginaw Kid. By living
a temperate, and an out of doors life for
a year past he rounded into unexpected
form. As far as the tight went he seemed*
as good as when he was successfully de
fending his title to the lightweight cham
pionship. â  What would have happened
had the fight been prolonged will never
be known. ; - â¢ . / . .
Heagerty. saw yesterday the folly, of
mixing things wtih such a master at in
nghting as Lavigne. He funy intended
to stay away from- tho Kin, but lost his
head and whatever chance he had of win
ning. ; The idea that he must, win quickly
tooK possession ot him and he cast dis
cretion to the winds.
Lavigne will proDably fight Art Simms
or JacK O'Brien next month. Heagerty
has been promised a reiurn matcn m

night was about 2%0o. The nghters' sn&ru
was $1200, which, it is: said, was: divided
between them.
The last important light of the year
will be the meeting between George Gard

Mechanics' Pavilion. ' When, they first
met Carter claims he was away below

EASTERN DOGS
TO COURSE ON
LOCAL FIELDS
G. Lacy Crawford of St. Louis
Wifl Send on His Kennel
to Winter in California
The prosperous condition of the coursing
game in California has attracted the at
tention of Eastern leashmen. The predic
tion is generally made among local advo
cates of the sport that the pick of the
crack coursers from the other side of the
Rockies will be sent on to compete dur
ing the winter months for our rich
stakes. *
Climatic and other conditions advance
the Idea of such a proposition and the out
look for the Easterner is pleasant except
on the point of easy winnings. The game
sportsmen of the East and the Middle
West have some well bred and fast grey
hounds which are looked upon at home
as champions. When pitted against the
campaigners of the local kennels the in
vaders will find themselves in a class a
notch or two above anything they hava
met.
G. Lacy Crawford, a young millionaire
Ieaahman, and an enthusiastic member of
the Pastime Coursing Club of St. Louis,
has signified his intention of giving his
best dogs a try with the class hounds ol
this State. He has about completed ar
rangements to ship his star performers
here for the winter. That means thac
within a few weeks the dogs will be en
tered to the stakes at Coursing
Park
The' Crawford kennel enjoys the reputa- j
tion of having- the best lot of greyhounds^
now running in the East on it3 list and
with, this addition to the fast aggregation
of coursers local patrons of the sport can
look forward to a lively winter in cours
ing circles. " â â - 'â _
Among the pick of the Crawford kennel
that will be sent on la imported Warbur
ton. Barton Tag. Reckless Archer, pur
chased as a. puppy from J. H. Rosseter,
and Boundless, winner of a recent puppy
stake at St. Louis, by Waratah, out of
Anchorin Leland.
Reports from Butte. Mont., show the
coursing season Just ended has proved a
successful one. G. H. Macdougall. well
known to the local leashman, heads the
list of winners. His dog Lethbrldge took
first honors in stake money. Chilco, an- '
other of Macdougall's coursers, was third
on the list. King Cashier finished in sec
ond place with six stakes to his credit.
Lethridge won two, Chilco divided onn
and Spindle won one. Lethbridgo and
Chilco were each four times in second
place and took third money four and
three times, respectively. King Cashier
was their undoing on these occasions" and
proved too hard a game for them. As a
rule Macdougall's coursers reached their
finals after hard going and in tired con
dition. Cashier started nine times and
Lethbridge fourteen. Lethbridge had the
record for winning courses, getting the
flag *a thirty-eight out of forty-eight
Slips. - " :.
King Cashier will be remembered by tha
Union Park, talent Â« as a courser that
made them distribute considerable money
to the pikers about a year ago by his
unlooked for winning 1 style when he was
considered - an -outsider. . The youngstec 2
got .the flag from some good performer* |A
when the odds were as strong as 15 to l**J
against his chances.
A lively season ia predicted for next
year's meeting at Butte. â  â

Fred K. Bushnell has lost by death his
great St. Bernard champion, Le Prince
Jr. The dog died yesterday at San
ClementÂ© of dropsy, from which he has
been suffering for two months. Mr. Bush
nell refused an offer of $5000 for him
when he was in the height of his prize
winning on the bench show circuit.
He purchased him as a puppy from his
breeder. C. A. Pratt of Argyle kennels.
LJttle 'Rock, Ark. The dog was pro
nounced by competent Judges the finest
smooth-coated St. Bernard in America.
His Bire, L* Prince, a rough-coated dog,
was never defeated on the bench. His
dam, Judith Rachel, was a smooth-coatÂ£d
St. Bernard. In color Le Prince Jr. was
deep orange, with correct white mark
ings and dark shadings.
Le Prince Jr. made two circuits of the
Eastern bench shows, where he swept
everything before him, winning first and
special in every class to which he was
eligible. The breed on this coast suffers
a distinct loss in his death, while his
owner can never hope to replace him, as
two 6uch splendid dogs seldom come to
one man in a lifetime.
FATHER JAOQUET'S BEAB,
CUBS AHE HEARD FROM
Professor Huber Traveling Overland
From Seattle and Exhibiting
Th.em En Route,
SAN JOSE. Dec 13.â There is a mystery
surrounding the non-arrival of two bear
cubs shipped from Alaska by ' Father
Jacquet for Santa Clara College and the
Academy of Notre Dame of this city.
When Father Jacquet left St. Joseph's
Church last summer to do mission work
in Alaska he promised the academy and
college that he would send them a pres
ent characteristic of Alaska. About the
first of November word was received that
two young cu'os had been shipped to this
city in the care of Professor Huber and
that they were then in Seattle. A day
or so later Huber sent word that tha
bears had become fatigued by the ocean
voyage and that he would give them a
four days' rest in Seattle before proceed
ing to this city.
That was the last direct news of the
bears or the professor. Now, however,
information has come to the college -from
private sources that the professor is
coming overland and is giving exhibitions
along the route. It is said the bears are
well trained and that by representing that
they belong to the Santa Clara College
he is gathering in a rich harvest of dimes
and nickels.
Current Breaks Up the Ship.
TACOMA. Dec. 13.â Hoquiam dispatches
say that the cause of the breaking up, of
the French bark Ernest Reypr on ihe
beach at the mouth of Quinault *liver was
a peculiar one. The Ernest Reyer was
resting nearly crosswise of the outlet cf
the stream, with the current passing
around each end. The current finally
worked through under the center of the
ship and deepened the channel rapidly,
until the vessel rested on her two ends.
Her back is steadily breaking. Had the
vessel been lengthwise of the channel her
prospects for getting away uninjured
would have been "good.
Oil in San Mateo County.
REDWOOD CITY. Dec. 13.â Oil pros
pects c'n the coast side of this county are
beginning to interest prospectors and
there is promise of great activity. At the
Holje place on the western slope of the
mountains, at an elevation of 500 feet,
wells have been sunk from which a good
supply of oil is being taken. It is pro
posed to sink a large number of wells
within a small radius, so that they may
be operated by one engine. There is talk
of a pipe line to facilitate the shipment
of the product.
Sonoma County Gold Strike.
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 13.â The residents
of Bloomfield and vicinity are gTeatly
elated over a gold discovery. A quartz
ledge on the mountain ranch of Cannon
brothers was recently unearthed, and
upon being assayed was found to contain
gold, silver and cinnabar, the yellow
metal predominating ar.d running about
512 to the ton. Similar ledges have been
discovered on the Hinshaw and Johnson
ranches adjoining.

OAKLAND AGAIN
FALLS BEFORE
THE AMERICANS
Waterbury Plays Good Ball,
but Receives Rank Support.
Dudes Hit Fraser Freely
The high-salaried stars from the Amer
ican Baseball League again handed it to
the cripples yesterday to the music of
1 to 6. The contest was. a decided im
provement over that of Thursday, though
the cripples were woefully weak in the
outfield. Dr. Mosklman, as if to have re
venge on his colleagues for the way they
treated him Thursday, was . the arch of
fender. He dropped a simple fly from
Fraser's bat In the fourth when two were
gone, which finally let in two tallies. Im
mediately after he failed to run fast
enough after fly. This re
sulted in a two-bagger tor me batsman,
though, the ball snould- certainly have
been captured. Hamilton also shared in
the ragged fielding, dropping a liner trom
Lajoie's bat, whicn allowed a couple.more
of the Americans to trot home. x
Waterbury, hiwing's amateur, was on
the slab for Oakland and he did himself
proud, allowing but six hits, three of
which should nave been prevented. He
also hit out a clean single, scored a run
and made a great stop of Pickering's hot
grounder in the sixth round. Altogether,
Waterbury did gilt edge workâ much bet
ter than those who have had more ex
perience. .
Each side scored in the first inning.
Devereaux walked, took second on Moh
ler 1 s pass, went to third on a throw-in
from right field and, scored on Streib's
out from short to first. For the Ameri
cans Barrett hit, stole second, took third
on an infield out and crossed the pan on
Lajoie's hit.
Hamilton's error in the third was re
sponsible fax^ two â¢ runs, and' Mosklman' s
poor fielding let In three more during the
next round. The Easterners made their
last point in the seventh, when Barrett,
after getting four bad ones, sprinted
home on Lajoie's double.
With the score standing 2 to 6 against
them, the Dudes made a final rally in the
seventh; when hits by Waterbury Dev
ereaux, Streib and Dunleavy, combined
with a couple of bases on balls, netted
three runs and nearly tied the score.
-Chick" Fraser of Philadelphia handed
the curves and shoots for the Eastern
men. He was much easier than "Rube."
as the cripples secured nine safe ones
from him. Mercer's great throw from
right field, which caught Dunleavy at the
plate in the seventh, was the most bril
liant feature of the game. The score:

BIDES ON HIS BICYCLE â¢
XTP ICE-BOUND YUKON
Klondiker Narrowly Escapes Death
During Novel Trip Out From
Dawson.
TACOMA, Dec 13.â Klondike passengers
with Dawson advices to November 28 ar
rived to-day. W. B. Sanford of the Daw
son Electric Light Company was one of
them. Robert Young, also of the Klon
dike, came as fax as Skagway, his home,
where both arrived on December 7. Young
rode much of the way up the Yukon on a
bicycle, breaking through the Ice at one
point and narrowly escaping drowning.
Sanford, traveling by sled and on foot,
made better time. â¢
Skagway telegraphic advices from Daw
son tell of a small stampede during the
first days of December to Hart Creek, -a
tributary of Peel River. The latest rush
for gold appears to have been precipitated
by the mysterious actions of a pioneer
prospector named James Bull. With sev
eral natives and a long string of dogs he
arrived from the Peel River country De
cember 2 and began purchasing supplies.
While declining to make any public state
ment he quietly told some of his Klondike
friends that he had made promising dis
coveries hence the rush.
The winter stage service was instituted
this week between White Horse and Daw
son.. Passengers were to be carried by
December 14.

FAITH WITH SHERIFF
Allowed to Make Trcmg Trip Alone
When Court Had Denied
Him Bail.
CONCONULLY. Wash., Dec. 13.â W. W.
Landes, a prisoner convicted of horse
stealing, sentenced to three years in the
State prison and refused bail while his
appeal Is pending, was allowed to ride
alone to Looxnis on private business by
Sheriff H. H. Nichols. So much Indigna
tion was expressed over the Sheriff's un
usual action that the officer started after
Landes, but of his own accord the pris
oner returned after two days spent in
Loomis. He is now In jail again.
Sheriff Nichols' peculiar course is ac
counted for by his friendship for Landes.
Before the man came to trial he* was al
lowed to go hunting with the Sheriff and
was given many privileges not usually ac
corded prisoners accused of. horse steal
ing. The Sheriff scouted the idea that his
friend would give him the slip while in
Loomls. Now ne Is trying to raise a fund
to send Mrs. Landes to Walla Walla with
her husband until the man's appeal can
be heard. ;::; .

Court of Napa for a writ of habeas cor
pus in the case- of her daughter Henri

her liberty at the Napa State Hospital. It
is alleged in the petition that the daughter

commitment was made is void and un
constitutional.' The writ was issued and
the time for hearing it was set for Tues

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SATUHDAY, DECEMBER 14. 1901.
ROYAL FLUSH GALLOPS HOME
BEFORE A VERY TRASHY FIELD
Jockey Redfern Makes His Appearance^ Capturing; the : Handicap
With Princess Titan ia---Katie' Walcott and Vantine Score at
Long C)ddsâ -Sister Jeanie Disposes of Her Rielci: Very Cleverly
THE hooded Britisher Royal Flush,
running in the colors \ of ; Green
Morris, fastened on to his first
purse earned on American soil at
Oakland yesterday. â  The distance
was one mile and his odds were played
down to 7 to 10. The pace set' by Rush
fields and Goldone was ridiculously slow,
and when O'Connor got ready he moved
to the front with Flush, winning in a can
ter. Rushfields downed Goldone" a neck
for the place, with Brutal, the only other
starter, a neck farther away. The mile
was covered in 1:43*4, making it the poor
est race of the day from a time stand
point. â¢ â¢ â  , â¢â¢â¢â ..â  . r : -
First choices, ran into squally weather
at the start, and only on two occasions
escaped disaster. Katie Walcott, Posi
tion, Princess Titania and Vantine were
all quoted at luscious prices in the ring.
The air was crisp but hot cold, and the
attendance large, betting being especially
lively. â¢ â "â â¢â â¢
Little Jockey Redfern, just about as big
as a minute, was not long in placing a
winner to his credit. . He finished second
on Dawson in the first event, and later
on had the leg up on Princess Titania, an
86-pounder in the three-quarter handicap.
According to the market prices in the
ring it looked a. very open thing, .but
events' showed the Princess to be several
pounds the best. : She was cut off soon
after the start, and when under full sail
again Redfern found. himself pocketed on
the rail behind Frank Bell and Articulate:
Taking -the outside from the head of tho
stretch home the precocious youngster,
crouching very low, hand-rode his mount
and beat Frank Bell and Fitzkanet more
than a length in 1:13%.
Owen Mounce started the game by put
ting Katie Walcott, a 15 to 1 shot, over
the plate first in the opening sprint, for
which Courtier went to the post favorite.
Never worse than fifth, Katie finished
resolutely, downing Dawson a length. Al
moner finished third and the favorite
next, hard ridden by O'Connor. . â¢
For a time it looked as if Relna de
Cuba would succeed in stealing the mile
selling purse. She backed up '-awfully;
though, the last eighth, and Position, a.
6 to 1 chance, also piloted by Mounce,
scored easily by a length. San Venado.
the favorite, took some hard riding,- but
couldn't get up. â¢ .. â  :â 
gister Jeanie, the entry of "Walter Jen
nings in the two-year-old sprint, received
splendid handling at O'Connor's hands,
defeating The Giver cleverly Â« at the wire.
The winner closed a 9 to 5 favorite, while
15 to 1 was laid about The .Giver. ' Dean
Swift, the second choice, fared badly.
Starter Jake Holtman's lasf start in a
Futurity course spin turned out a ragged
one. Away in the first section, Vantine
passed Abba L, and at 12 to 1 ran in two
lengths before Dangerous Maid, the favor
ite. With an equal break the last-named
mare would undoubtedly have won.
Track Notes.
The stewards fined Lee Jackson $50 yes
terday for rough riding the previous day
on Romany. â 
McGinn, who finished : second on Rush
fields, rode with more than ordinary suc
cess on the Eastern tracks the past sea
son. His engagements while here will be
made by "Doc" Robbins.
Master Redfern, considered by ' many
the coming lightweight of the country,
will ride next season East for Colonel
Pepper at a salary of $8000. " ' . " "
Mounce and O'Connor each landed a
brace of winners. The former rider la
growing .and taking on weight rapidly,
and will soon be a member of the heavy
weight division."- -/â 
When here a year, ago "Boots.". Durnell
gave â  as his" opinion that" Royal Flush
could give any horse in England a beat-
Ing over a mile course.
Tommy Burns, the well known rider,
was an onlooker yesterday. Tommy had
a hard fall at the recent Bennlngs meet-
Ing, but will be in the saddle again In
about a week.
George Rose will assume control of the
field books to-day and will also put on a
book in the ring.
"Dell" Fountain won a small fortune
on Katie Walcott and added to it in the
next race by the win of his horse Posi
tion.

ing reported the true state of affairs.
Thomas R. Elphick, the husband of the
accused woman, also appeared in court
and informed the Justice that his wife's

WIFE UPSETS
BRIBER'S STORY
Margaret Lynch Causes
Sensation at Chicago
Trial.
CHICAGO, Dec. 13.â Mrs. Margaret
Lynch, wife of ex-Bailiff James J. Lynch,
the confessed jury briber, was the star
witness to-day, in- the early session of the
trial of Alexander Sullivan, charged with
alleged conspiracy to keep Lynch from
being tried for his crime. She. gave the
lie'direct to much of her husband's testi
mony, on ] which ' the State had largely
based its case.- -She has been separated
from her husband for some time.
Mrs. Lynch denied emphatically that
Alexander Sullivan's name was mentioned
either by her husband or. by George P.
-Murray on the night when Murray is said
to "have called on Lynch to ask him to
accompany him to Sullivan's house.
Lynch testified some time ago that Mur
ray said he called at Sullivan's behest,
and that Sullivan wanted to send Lynch
to Canada In. order? to avoid being tried
for. jury bribing. Mfs. Lynch further tes
tified in contradiction to Lynch that
Lynch had expected Murray to call on
the night in question.
Joseph G. Mann, an attorney of Dan
ville, -,111., testified .that he .was Alexander
Sullivan's associate in. the case where jury
bribing was charged and that. he exam
ined the jurors. He stated that he had
never had any suspicion' of any tampering
done by Lynch, and that, he himself had
never had any. dealings with the prose
cuting witness. .' A strong objection was
made to admitting this testimony on the
ground that it- was immaterial. Mann,
however, ' made a personal, plea -to the
court: that his good , name might not bo
sullied by suspicion-cast upon him, and h-i
was allowed- to speak. â . . â¢ â  â¢ â >

YOUNG JANES
DEFEATED BY
MONROE GREEN
With. Victory in Sight He Is
./Compelled to Abandon
the Handball Tournament
i Monroe Green and Charles Melrose
the right. to the championship of
;the second and. third classes last night Jn
the handball tournament that has been
.In' progress, at the Olympic Club during
tho past three weeks.
Green met George "Janes, the phenoma
naFyoung player, who ha3 gone down thÂ»
line defeating the best in his class. Janes
had . victory In his grasp, but bis hand
gaye^ out and in the third game he re
luctantly quit the court, leaving Green
master of the situation. The contest be
tween Janes and Green was productive, of
clever playing. In the first game Janes
gave a wonderfully ciever exhibition and
easily defeated Green. In the second
game Janes had 14 to Green's 4. and was
in line for victory. His hand gave out
at this - critical point. Every time the
game youngster struck the ball he would
wince with pain. Green, seeing his op
ponent's weaknsss, played all the harder
and took the game in good style. Green
played with renewed confidence and was
winning in his own way. Janes could
barely use his right hand, and seeing his
case was hopeless wisely gave tip the*
contest.
Charles Melrose outplayed T. I. Fltz
patrlck In the final game in the third
class. The rubber was full of long rallies
and interesting plays, Jbut Melrose always
came out the victor. Fltzpatrick had no
toss and all his points were made in open
play. Melrose "killed" cleverly and put
up a heady game.
On Sunday afternoon George Janes and
Jack Gleason will contest for the'cham
pionship of the first class. ' This game has
attracted a great deal of interest and a
large crowd will be present when these
players meet.
The scores were: Melrose, 21, 21: Fitz
patrick, 19, 16; Green, 13, 21, 21; Janes, 21,

TARIFF STRIFE IN GERMANY.
REPORTS from Berlin show that the tariff con
troversy in that country is being carried on
with much more heat and bitterness than such
controversies ever excited here. In fact, the German
agitation approaches the fervor that marked the free
trade movement in Great Britain when for a time the
4emand for a repeal of the corn laws came near to
breaking out into something like civil war. The
German opponents of the Kaiser's tariff scheme are
not talking of insurrection, but nevertheless they are
displaying an antagonism that threatens to array class
against class and seriously disturb the whole social
organism.
The Kaiser desires an increased revenue and has
sought to obtain it partly by an increase of customs
duties. He himself has in all probability no preju-.
dice in favor of one kind of duty rather than an
other. He lias always held himself carefully aloof
from parties, and therefore it is hardly fair to hold
him responsible for the schedules of the tariff that
has been submitted. His Chancellor has doubtless
drawn up the bill as best he could to obtain the sup
port needed to carry it through the legislative
bodies. In doing so he has conceded so much to the
agrarians that he has aroused the intense opposition
of the workers in the cities, who perceive that higher
duties on agricultural products will mean an in
creased cost of bread. Their fight, therefore, is the
same that the British factory workers made against
the corn laws. It is a cry for food.
The bitterness with which the debate is carried on
was shown by a recent incident in the Reichstag.
Herr Bebel, in opposing the bill, denounced it as a
"hunger tax" and argued that its direct tendency is
toward a reduction of the working people to starva
tion. Warming to his theme he appealed to the sen
timent of his hearers and told a pathetic story of a
dying child in Berlin who said, "I will be glad to
get to heaven because there is no hunger there." The
pathos was spoiled by a shout of mocking laughter
from the agrarians, and one of them said the child's
hunger was doubtless due to the fact that her parents
spent their money on beer rather than bread. ;..
That meant of course that the agrarian landlords
have no sympathy with vvorkingmen and are not to
be moved by tales of starvation. Those stories, how
ever, have a profound effect upon the working
classes, and it will be seen there is an antagonism of
sentiment and sympathy that is decidedly dangerous.
Free trade was carried in Great Britain by a series
of bad years that ruined crops and brought something
like famine to the people. . In the face of the need
of more food it was impossible for the Government
to retain the corn laws. What would happen in Ger
many if at the present juncture a bad year should
come and the people actually feel the pinch of star
vation it is impossible to say. It is certain, however,
the agrarians are playing in big luck in having a
chance to present their tariff at a time when crops
are abundant and food is not scarce in any part of
the civilized world, unless certain remote parts of
Russia be called civilized.
The international effect of the tariff is not likely to
be anything like so acute as the domestic effect.
There has been much talk of its interference with
American trade, but it may prove less hurtful than is
feared. Our chief interest in it lies in the reported
statement of the Kaiser that if he did not get re
ciprocity he would "get in and smash things." Well,
he is not going to get reciprocity, and if the new
German tariff is an illustration of his idea of smash
ing things we need not be alarmed hereafter by any
thing he may say in his moments of exuberance.
The managers of the ceremonies of King Edward's
coronation arc said to be trying their best to get rid
of a great deal of the ancient tomfoolery that has de
scended with the aristocracy from the middle ages,
and as a result a good many lords and titled dames
have reached the conclusion that the managers are a
set of tomfools themselves.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1901.
AN UNWISE COUNCIL.
PROFESSOR COUNCIL imparts lore to the
students of the Alabama Agricultural and Me
chanical College. We have not at hand the
catalogue of that able institution, and therefore are
not prepared to say whether he teaches the proper
method of ringing the rooters "of. the primitive pigs
of the region, which exist on the roots of the forest
and fatten on its oak mast, or whether he; instructs
in the proper tone in which the milky mother of the
herd is to be called "So, boss)" and made to "hoist,"
in preparation for the bi-daily manipulation of her
dugs. However, no matter what the line of learn
ing he pulls in the college, we discuss him in his more
exposed, public and prominent role as a teacher of
wisdom in ethnology,' politics and etiquette.
Incident to the recognition of Professor Washing
ton by President Roosevelt there has been a renewed
agitation in a certain section of the South of the fear
that the "damnigger" is going to walk away with the
birthright of those proud people. We notice that the
sense of desecration of the White House mahogany
by having Washington's black;legs under it has not
caused any of the Southern Senators and Represen
tatives to decline President Roosevelt's invitation to
dine with him, and perhaps sit in the same chair oc
cupied by the negro, eat from the same plate, maybe,
and with the same knife and fork, wiping their chaps
on the same napkin. Senators Pettus, Mallory, Fos
ter of Louisiana, and Clay, and a large number of
others, have accepted the same hospitality that was
enjoyed by Washington and have not been asked to
resign by their constituents.
What the consequences would be if Professor
Council were invited we are not able to predict. Of
course he would decline, but the form of his declina
tion must be contemplated through smoked spec
tacles or some other medium to protect the eye from
the lurid language in which it would be/ couched.
This opinion of Professor Council is based upon a
recent delivery that has brought him into the fierce
focus of publicity.
Until a few days ago he was as unknown as was
our vermiform appendix until the surgeons opened
an abdominal flap and detected it in the- act of at
tacking the rest of our insides. ' But he is known now.
He has publicly laid down three propositions on the
sectional and race issue and thereupon challenges all
comers. These are: "1. That the^nly pure Anglo-
Saxon blood to be fcund in the United States is in
the South. 2. That this pure Anglo-Saxon blood will
rule by the ballot, if possible, but by the bullet if
necessary. 3- That when the negro undertakes to
step over the line separating the two races he will
step from life to death."
It is news that the Anglo-Saxon is prevalent in the
South and is found there only. In the Carolinas a
considerable part of the early settlers were Gascons.
They came from that part of France where an ele
vated imagination and a hereditary habit of lying has
made mountains out of mole hills, eagles out of mud
hens, and has turned gray geese into swans. So we
have the term "gasconading" to describe that sort of
swashbuckling which has come down even to this
generation. The two greatest natives of South Caro
lina were Calhoun, a Scotchman, and Andrew Jack
son, of Scotch-Irish lineage. Then the Huguenots
peopled the South and gave us the long and illus
trious line of the Bayards of Delaware, the Maurys,
Le Contes and many more. The French Acadians
settled Louisiana, in company with a direct immi
gration from France, and gave us Pierre Soule and
a distinguished company of publicists and statesmen.
The Jews were not behind the rest, and a long pro
cession of them was led by Judah P. Benjamin. But
we will call the roll no further upon Professor Coun
cil. In the elucidation of his thesis of three horns
he takes occasion to assert the general superiority of
the South over the North and its greater skill in
handling the gun and his general contempt for every
thing up our way, which he boldly refuses to conceal.
ft is only the knowledge that his own section will
laugh at the chattering jay that makes one at all pa
tient with his vanity, bad manners and ignorance.
But he got his name in the papers, and that was
probably the object of his effort.
Reports concerning Major Van Tets, the Dutch
officer who resented the treatment of the Queen by
her husband, Prince Henry, are various. Some say
he was killed in a due! by a pistol-shot, others that
he was wounded with a sword in a scuffle, while a
third report is that lie was kicked in the stomach.
All agree, however, that he interfered in a family
quarrel and got the usual reward.
ALASKAN POSSIBILITIES.
WHEN the time came for Governor John C.
Brady of Alaska to issue his Thanksgiving
proclamation last month he began by say
ing: "We in Alaska, in comparing our blessings
with those which our friends enjoy in other places,
find that we have much for which to be thankful.
Some things are so common and constant with us
that we scarcely appreciate them â our equable cli
mate and the abundance of rain. The terrible heat
of the past summer in the East: did not disturb our
comfort, but "aroused our sympathies for those who
had to endure it. Drought and arid wastes we can
not complain of. We have an abundance of grass,
and where men have attempted to till the earth it has
yielded many fold, and those who have tried it are'
satisfied that greater things are in store for them." >
When the Alaskan gives thanks for his climate
and for the abundance of grass and the bright pros
pects of .his agriculture we are inclined to believe a:
joke is intended. However, there is no joke in the N
Governor's proclamation. He went on to, point out
that in addition to the equability of the climate, the
abundant rainfall, the absence of torrid heats, the
profusion of grass and the prospects of good results
from the tillage of the soil, the people of Alaska have
reason to be thankful because their fisheries are
profitable and the mineral wealth is more promising
than ever before. Now all of , those statements, with
the exception of that referring to the climate, are in
dorsed to some extent in the official report of the
Secretary of the Interior.
When William H. Seward induced the Government:
of the United States to pay out a large sum of money
for Alaska he was .ridiculed, and his purchase' was
made the subject of no end of jesting and sarcasm.
In fact, Congress was induced to carry gut the pur
chase more out of friendship to Russia than out of
any liking for Alaska. Events have proven that
Seward builded wiser than he knew. Alaska is really a
rich country in its way and is worth many times over
the price that was paid for it. In fact, it is stated by
the Secretary that from the Nome district alone the
output of gold this season is estimated at $7,000,000,
just about the amount that Seward paid for the whole
vast region.
The productiveness of Alaskan gold fields is, how
ever, by no means, so interesting astory just now as
that portion of the report relating to the possibilities
of tilling the Alaskan soil and getting. from it enough
in the. way of food. to enable any considerable popu
lation to live there, and enjoy that climate.
. The report *says that market 'gardens are now found
near Skagwayy Daiwson and Eagle"- . and at j various
points in Central. and Southern Alaska. It is added
that along the banks of the great rivers there are vast
tracts of arable land. Hay can be cured in the val
leys to the north of the Coast Range, but along the
southern coast the frequent rains render the drying
of hay a difficult â â¢ matter. In that region, however,
the silo has been used with success. In fact, such
experiments as have been made in the way of. agri
culture or market-gardening in Alaska have been, so
successful as to lead the Governor to recommend an
increased appropriation for an extension of the ex
periment stations. >>";â¢_ 'â "!;-,
It will be seen that Governor Brady's Thanksgiv
ing exuberance was hot without something of reason
to justify it. It may be a long time before people will
go to Alaska "for an equable climate, but there seems*
every assurance that it may .develop -into. a\-country
where a high degree of the comfort 'of civilization ;
may be maintained. : At any rate, it must ' be gratify
ing to the pioneers of the Territory â  to'* know that
their Governor is a boomer and not a pessimist. He
is not going to. give 'Alaska a black eye either inan
official report- or a Thanksgiving proclamationr
The British War Office complains that while there
is no difficulty in getting recruits for the war in South
Africa very . few of them know how to shoot, so if
they are accepted by the army they are of. no use
until they have been through a long course of >< in
struction. The consequence has been a movement
for the organization of rifle clubs- among the""peo
ple, and ere long the average Briton will know a
gun when he sees it and also what to do with it when
he gets hold, of it. .â '*â '
AN IRRIGATION PRECEDENT.
PRESIDENT cordial in
dorsement of the policy of providing irriga
tion for the arid regions of. the country,
wherever such irrigation can be economically main
tained, has had the effect of bringing the issue into
the domain of practical politics. It has been under
discussion a long-time and several tentative meas
ures have been enacted by Congress for dealing
with it. The prospects are that it may noWbe soon
taken up in a comprehensive way and a scientific
plan devised for redeeming millions of barren or
semi-barren acres.
Senator Bard is quoted as saying that at present
the chief difficulty in the way of providing for irri
gation is a difference of opinion on matters of detail
among those who favor the policy on general prin
ciples. That of course might have been foreseen.
The discussion up to this time has been almost
wholly academic, and every one interested in it has
felt at liberty to devise his own scheme for, carrying
out the project. Now that the time for action is at
hand it is necessarily difficult to harmonize conflicting
views. Among practical statesmen, however, that
difficulty will not be insuperable. In fact, it ought
to be possible for the irrigationists of Congress to
get together on some bill at this session and press
it to a vote so that the people may understand who
are for it and who are against it'.
If any precedent were needed to demonstrate anew
the value of irrigation carried out on a large scale
it would be found in what has been accomplished by
the British in Egypt... In a recent report on the sub
ject Lord Cromer states-that since 1885. the govern
ment of Egypt has expended over $35,000,000 on pub
lic works connected with the Nile. That is an enor
mous outlay for a country so poor as Egypt, but
the results prove it to have been one of the most suc
cessful achievements of British rule. ' It has had the
effect of doubling the cotton crop and adding, up
ward of $25,000,000 annually to the income of; the
people.
Basing conclusions upon the results thus obtained
by improved irrigation facilities in Lower Egypt, the
British are sanguine that an even larger proportional
benefit will be derived from comprehensive irrigation
along the Upper Nile. It is proposed to dam one of
the lakes which form the sources of the Nile and so
create a' huge reservoir to draw upon at need.
Sir William Garstin, who has charge of the en
gineering problems involved in the scheme, states in
a recent report that a series of dams aud canals can
be so constructed that the completed work will not
only provide irrigation for millions of arid acres, but
will also drain extensive swamps, and, finally, im
prove the navigation of the Upper Nile as well: The
accomplishment of three such important benefits by
a single scheme of improvement will certainly rank
among the best things the white man has yet per
formed in the task of improving the condition of in
ferior races.
What Great Britain is doing for the poor people
of Egypt the United States can certainly undertake
to do for the benefit of its own people. Modern'
engineering is quite equal to any task the policy will
impose upon it. We cannot afford to let Egypt beat
us in the work of turning the desert into a garden.
The Immigration Restriction League is busily en
gaged in the task of educating, Congress up to the
point of adopting a thorough educational standard as
a requisite for admission of immigrants, and as pub
lic opinion favors the idea it is quite possible we may
have such a standard provided at this session of Con
gress.
It is now fairly certain that none of Kasson's re
ciprocity treaties will be ratified : by the Senate/but
the Commissioner can find consolation in the fact
that he held a high position, did a good, deal of din
ing with the august diplomats of Europe and will get
a good salary for having had a high time. â¢
The automobile that won the "endurance race from
New York to Buffalo last September, has been re
cently used to open up a snow-filled road, and the
farmers along the way have now a respect for the
machine that is said to be something immense.
It is now reported that Bryan is willing to become
a candidate for the Governorship of Nebraska, and
should he fail to get the nomination he is willing to
run for Congress. In fact, he seems willing, to- do
anything that will give him a chance to talk.
When Lord Kitchener sent Miss Hobhouse back
to England he doubtless thought he i s had got rid.of
her, but he, was mistaken. She is going to j sue him
for damages, and he will have to "follow Boer tactics
and keep out of the way. .
It is said to be, much easier toselect an appropriate
present for a woman than for a man, and perhaps that
is the reason why the . course of ' Christmas giving
runs mainly in the direction of the ladies., i
With every wise woman the motto of the season is;
"Shop early and avoid the rush.'' V

Even if Connecticut has lost the art of
making wooden nutmegs, it still possesses
similar ingenuity in other directions. In
the efforts of the tobacco growers of that
State to drive the Sumatra wrapper leaf
from the market they have evolved a
means of artificially producing the light
brown spots that are found in the Sumat
ra leaf, and which is one of the char
acteristics that' give it popularity with
smokers. â¢
* For many years experimenters were try
ing to produce these spots in the domestic
leaf, but any preparation that was strong
enough to spot the leaf was strong enough
to/burn a hole through it,. aritU* spoil it.
Now a spotting fluid has been discovered,
and plants still standing are sprayed with
it.: ' â â â  - â â¢ 'â  --- : -
The man who does the spraying, takes
a bottleful of the yellow- caustic potash

with the spraying attachment, and starts
down the tobacco row, giving each plant
a dose as he passes. And thus Connecti
cut tobacco with Sumatra tobacco spots

The Moon Is Receding.
Scientists say that the moon is receding
farther and farther from the earth, and
will continue to recede for countless ages
until the terrestial day is shorter than the*
lunar month. Millions of years ago, when
the earth was a molten mass, It revolved
around its axis once every .five or six
hours. The moon then. was a part of the
earth, but in time was broken off and be
came its satellite.
Aa the motion of the earth decreased
and the day became longer, the distance
of the moon became greater. Our day
is now twenty-four hours long and tl>e
moon is 240,000 miles away. As the length
of the terrestrial day increased so did ;hÂ»
distance of the moon. The two quantities v/

Urge Action on Hep
burn Bill.
Congressmen Unite in Plan
to Secure Rapid Leg
islation. â¢
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â The Mouse
Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce at its first meeting fo-day
voted to favorably report the Hepburn
bill providing for the construction of
the Nicaragua canal. Representative
Fletcher of Minnesota was the only mem
ber voting against reporting the bill.
Before the vote . was taken several
amendments were proposed. One by
Adamson of Georgia was agreed to, pro
viding that the expenditure of 510,000,000
as provided by the bill shall be made on
warrants signed by the President of tne
United States. Other amendments, fix
ing a minimum and maximum depth for
the canal were voted down, the desire
being Â»to retain the original form of the
Hepourn bill as nearly as possible. Chair
man Hepburn was directed to urere the
measure ta consideration and a vote in
the House at- the -earliest practicable
time.
Hepburn said after the meeting tbat he
would push the bill in the House as one
oÂ£ the tlrst measures to be taken up after
the holidays. The unanimity of the com
mittee to-day was .gratifying to the
friends of the canal measure. Adamson,
a Democrat, of Georgia, moved to report
the bill, and the entire Democratic mem
bership of the committee voted for . the
bill. Adamson Is co-operating with
Chairman Hepburn on the floor of the
House with a view to securing united
action when the measure comes up.

SHIP JAMES KERR'S WILD
EXPERIENCE OFF CAPE HORN
Gale Drives Her Down to Sixty South Among the Icebergs Near
the Poleâ Bering Brings a Million-Dollar Cargo, Which Is
Largely Composed of Furs From the Siberian Coast
THE BRITISH SHIP JAMES KERR IN THE ICEBERGS NEAR THE SOUTH POLE. SHE WAS DRIVEN OFF.
CAPE HORN IN A GALE AND FOR A TIME BOTH CAPTAIN AND CREW THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD
GO DOWN.
A GENERAL average has been de
clared on the British ship James
Kerr. She was caught in a ter
rific gale off the Horn and driven
south until she was in the Ice
bergs near the pole. At times the mem
bers of the crew thought it was all over
with them and many a day they had to
go aloft in order to loosen the roÂ»es in
the frozen blocks. Regarding 1 the perilous
voyage Captain Powles said:
"We were in latitude 60 degrees south
when the men suffered most. Everything
was frozen tight and as the ship had suf
fered in a storm none of us knew just
where we were. Luckily the weather
changed and we rounded the Horn in
safety.
"We were on our way here from Ant
werp and had reached the eastward of
Staten Island when the gale came up. It
was a strong norther and on November 12
it started in to blow a gale from" the
northwest. When we were down to 60 de
grees south I hove the ship to under up
per topsails and lower " main topgallant
sail and jib. We were then on the star
board tack and had to keep the ship
sharp up in order to hold her own. Luck
ily a calm came and for three hours we
could not get a knot an hour out of her.
I wore the ship and in half an hour afte*
doing so a hurricane came down that near,
ly buried the vessel. In order to save the
masts everything had to be let go, and
for hours we drove along under bare poles.
When the hurricane subsided we bent new
Â«sails and in spite of our many mishaps
we made the run front 50 to 50 in sixteen
days."
The James Kerr will load wheat at
Crockett for Europe.
SOME OVERDUE COASTERS.
Fears .Are Expressed for Them on
Account of Matteawan's Fate.
The suppqsed loss of the Matteawan
has caused owners to look nearer home.
Some of the fleet now on the coast are
a little behind time and while some have
been delayed by adverse winds it is proba
ble that others have been in trouble. The
schooner Gotama is out seven days from
Eureka: the Mary Etta, fourteen days
for Siuslaw; the four-masted schooner
Philippine, seventeen days from San
Pedro, for Tacoma; the barkentine
Retriever, twenty-four days from San
Pedro, for Port Hadlock; the Bchooner
S. Danielson, sixteen days from San
Francisco, for Siuslaw, and the schooner
Una is out eighteen days from San Diego,
for Coos Bay.
Brings Home Valuable Cargo.
The barkentine Bering made port early
yesterday morning with the most valuable
cargo of the year. She came from
Petropaulovski in twenty-eight days, one
of the quickest runs on record, but the
Russian-American Company thinks more
of the safo arrival than they do of the
quick run. Among the cargo of the Bering
are 2S3 ermine skins, 455 red fox skins, 102
white fox skins, 170 other skins, eight
glutton (sloth) skins, thirteen wool skins,
118 bear skins, 770 squirrel skins, and 400
cases of salmon. All told the Bering's
cargo Is worth much more than $1,000,000.
Arab Has Been Sold.
The British tramp steamer Arab has
been sold to the Dollar Steamship Com
pany and will in future have San Fran
cisco as her home port. She formerly
came here to carry freight and mules to
the Philippines for Uncle Sam, but when
half way to Honolulu broke down and had
to be turned back to port. On her arrival
here the strike was on and thÂ© repairs to
her machinery and boilers could not be
made. Now she is almost ready for sea.
On her next voyage the Arab will fiy the
Dollar flag.

TKOUBLES OF BIG DRUG
FIRM AIRED IN COTTRT
Manager of Wakelee & Co. Claims
He "Was Threatened by His
Assistant.
The trial of the suit of C. W. Randall
and others against Walter M. Willett
commenced in Judge Seawell's court yes
terday. The plaintiff seeks , an order of
court restraining "Willett from attachins
the business of. Wakelee & Co., the whole-
Bale druggists, and to set aside an agree
ment which Randall claims Willett forced
him to sign by threatening him, with ar
rest on a charge of embezzlement.
Randall, his wife and daughter own a
controlling interest in the drug company.
They borrowed $16,000 from Willett and
his wife on a note which will not become
due for live years. In consideration of
the loan Willed was taken into the firm,
and given the position of assistant man
ager at a salary of $200 per month. Ran
dall Is manager of the liipn, and in the
affidavit he riled yesterday he says he
could not get along with his assistant.
Under an agreement made at the time
the loan was secured Randall was to
draw certain sums from the business,
and one-half of the money so drawn was
to be paid to Willett. Willett says Ran
dall consented a short time after the
agreement went into effect to allow him
(Willett) to keep all of the moneys
drawn.
According to the affidavit, Willett want
ed to run the business, and when he
found that he could not he threatened to
force the Randalls to pay him the amount
of the loan, and also threatened to have
him- arrested on a charge of embezzle
ment, claiming that he was guilty of that
crime when he drew funds from the busi
ness.
Randall claims that Willett forced him
to sign a contract agreeing to the pay
ment of a certain sum by threatening him
with attachment proceedings and arrest.
He supports his claim by affidavits made
by his wife and daughter. In which they
state that they were also forced by Wil
lett to sign the document.
Randall submitted affidavits yesterday
from various prominent business men and
lawyers certifying to his honesty and
business abilities, and also a statement
of the assets and liabilities of the firm,
which, he claims, he has. managed for the
last twenty years. .
Biagini Family in Court.
Mrs. C. Florindo, grandmother of Laur
lndo Biagini, appeared in Department No.
9 of the Superior Court yesterday to sup
port her petition for letters of guardian
ship over the girl. The petition Is op
posed by Zaffiro Biagini, the father of the
child. A week ago Biagini attempted to
secure possession of the child by habeas
corpus proceedings, but his petition was
denied by Judge Seawell. Mrs. Plorlndo
contends that the father Is not a fit per
son to have the custody of the child. The
hearing of the case was continued for
one week.
Ex-Soldier Clark Asphyxiated.
Thomas W. Clark, a discharged soldier
of Company L, Twenty-second Infantry,
U. S. A., was found . asphyxiated in hla
bed at 765 Market street yesterday morn-
Ing. The gas was turned fully on and
the room was filled with the deadly

from the Philippines and waa on his way
to his home In Kentucky. Clark was
only 22 years of age.

FIRST SYMPHONY
CONCERT PLEASES
Paul Steindorff Wins
New Laurels as a
Leader.
The first concert of the San Francisco
Eymphony Society, given yesterday after
noon at the Grand Opera-house, must be
voted a genuine success. The compara
tively large house that greeted the new
leader and his men shows a highly en
couraging interest in the society, and the
work done yesterday afternoon by the con
ductor and the orchestra more than jus
tifies all, the interest shown. It Is not
quite the kind of thing that was expected
from Mr. Steindorff as a leader, but it is
something just as good and perhaps safer.
He surprised even his best friends yester
day afternoon by the general excellence
of the work done under his baton as well
as by its unexpected conservatism, and it
was found lacking only in those qualities
that time alone can furnish.
Mr. Steindorff has a particularly good
orchestra at his eommand, strong In the
strings and well balanced throughout,
though through the exigencies of the
Grand Opera-house stage accommodations
the wood wind loses its weight and the
whole tone of the orchestra is slightly
thinned and deadened. But practically all
of the best orchestral material In town Â»s
to be found in -the orchestra, though there
are still a few names that should not be
among the missing. Yesterday's work in
Its solid grip, balance, precision and sin
cerity amply proves that the orchestra
has "found a fitting leader In Mr. Stein
dorff. It Is a less spirited leadership
than had been looked for. from the enthu
siastic conductor of the Tivoll. but that
the spirit is there Mr. Stelndorff's efforts
during the Tivoli grand opera season wit
ness to full satisfaction, and' that he has
thought fit to sacrifice the easier enthu
siasm for a more classic correctness at
the outset of his gymphony career prom
ises well, Indeed, for his future work in
the society.
The programme of yesterday was a
modest one â rather a lightweight pro
gramme, in fact, and perhaps Insufficient
ly varied in character. â¢ The "Academic
Overture" of Brahms came first, with Its
ingeniously interwoven student melodies,
rhvthmlc fun, noble harmonies and large,
joyful spirit, well . interpreted by the or
chestra, though on -the whole it was tech
nically the least satisfying number on the
programme. There was admirable work
done in the Raff symphony "Im Walde,"
that followed, delicate, well poised, finely
balanced work, that showed Mr. Stein
dorff in his newer light to befet advantage.
The *'Largo Traumerei," with Its muted
string accompaniment and lovely echoing
flute and oboe melodies, was ! charmingly
given, and the dainty scherzo was also
given with elegance and spirit. One felt
a lack of climax in the heavy finale, but
it wag an excellent reading on the whole
and most promising. Two light numbers
of Moszkowsky's warmed the house up to
encore point, and the Spanish dance was
repeated to its evident enjoyment. The
pretty, abrupt ' Volkmann â¢ serenade, for
strings, came next, and the Slavic -color
and brassy richness of Liszt's "Rakocsky
March" closed the enjoyable programme.
Considering the refrigerator-like atmos
phere of the Grand Opera-house â like
every other symphony concert-house, . by
the way â the audience was an enthusias
tic one, . though on the whole it would
have been better satisfied with heavier
fare. It wijl get that at the next concert,
on January 10, when the following pro
gramme will be given: Overture, "Uebor
Zwel Thueringische Volkslleder" (first
time), Lassen; symphony No. 5:; C minor,
L. von Beethoven; scherzo, "Midsummer
Xight's Dream," Mendelssohn; prelude
from "Die Meisterslnger." Wagner;
"Rouet d'Omphale," symphonic poem,
Saint-Saens. " â¢ -
Meantime there - is everything to be
hoped from the new band and its leader.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. DECEMBER^ 14, 1901.
LITIGATION MAY
FOLLOW RULING
Par-Reaching Effect of
Decision Regarding
Insanity Law.
Bondgnien of Treasurer and
Auditor Thought to
Be Liable.
The decision of the Supreme Court in
the Lambert case, filed a few days ago,
may prove a bombshell to various Supe
rior Judges and city officials and result in
suits against the bondsmen of the Auditor
and Treasurer for the recovery of some
$25,000 paid out of the city treasury for
the examination.' and commitment of in
eane persons since 1897.
Under the decision all persons who were
committed to asylums for the insane may
secure their release on habeas corpus, it
having, been held by the court that thÂ»
statute under which they were committed
was unconstitutional and therefore void.
Auditor Wells has been notified that ha
will hereafter audit claims of the Com
missioners of Lunacy at his own risk, and
he is now investigating the matter.
Should he find that he or his bondsmen
are liable under the law. for the expendi
ture of money in this respect he will re
fuse to audit the said claims, which ag
gregate sums varying bet-ween $300 and
$600 each month.
The attention of the Attorney General
has been called to the situation resulting
from the decision in the Lambert case,
and as he is the proper official to see that
the rights of the people of the State are
properly guarded he may take steps to re
cover the money which has been paid
without warrant of law under the act now
declared to be unconstitutional. ; .
Improperly Restrained of Liberty.
The Lambert case, which is responsible
for the trouble and litigation wheih seems
inevitable, was an appeal from the Supe
rior Court of Napa County. W. H. Lam
bert alleged that he was improperly re
strained of his liberty by A. M. Gardner.
Lambert was an inmate of the asylum at
Napa, and he applied for a writ of habeas
corpus on his commitment to that institu
tion by Judge A. J. Buckles, of Solano on
November 9, 1S98. He alleged in his own
behalf that the act of March 31, 1S97
(Statutes of 1897, page 311), known as the
insanity law, under which the proceedings
for his commitment were had, was uncon
stitutional, in that he was thereby â  de
prived of his liberty without due process
of law; that the proceedings thereunder
â were insufficient to authorize his commit
ment, and that upon the application
therefor the Judge of the Superior Court
had no jurisdiction or authority to make
that order, and that the said order, to
gether with the documents accompanying
the same, did not justify his detention or
confinement.
Law Declared Invalid.
The Supreme Court analyzed the law of
1897, which provided for the organiza
tion of a State Commission in Lunacy
and denned its powers. Under this law
an accused person was arrested without
notice, and after a purely ex parte ex
aminationâby a commissioner acting un
der the authority of court was either
committed or released in accordance with
the evidence adduced. The court, in hold
ing this procedure to be contrary to the
provisions of the constitution, which
guarantee liberty to all citizens accord
ing to prescribed formulas, went on to
say:
An order for the commitment of a person
to an insane hospital Is essentially a judg
ment by which he is deprived of his liberty,
and it Is a cardinal principle in English juris
prudence that before any Judgment can be
pronounced against a person there must> have
been a trial of the Issue upon which the judg
ment is given. * . â¢ Â» â¢Tne constitutional
guaranty that he shall not be deprived of his
liberty without due process ,of law is violated
whenever such Judgment is 'had without giv
ing him an opportunity to be heard in defense
of the charge, and upon such hearing to oiler
evidence in support of his defense. If his
right to a hearing depends upon the will or
caprice of others, or upon the discretion or
will of the Judge who is to make a decision
upon the issue, he is not protected in his con
stitutional rights. (Underwood vs. People, 32
Mich. 1.) To say that, if he Is In fact Insane,
therefore any notice to him would be vain, is
to bsg the very question whose determination
underlies the right of the State to deprive him
of his liberty. The fact of his insanity is to
be determined before his right to his liberty
can be violated. If that question is determined
against him without any notice or opportunity
to be heard, or to introduce evidence in his
behalf, and under such determination he Is
confined In the hospital, his constitutional
guaranty is violated. - , . .
Under the foregoing considerations it must
be held that the insanity law of 1807, to the
extent that it authorizes the confinement of
a person in an insane asylum without giving
him notice and an opportunity to be heard
upon the charge against' him, is unconsti
tutional, and that the proceedings by. virtue
of which the petitioner is held by the respond
ent are invalid.
It is ordered that the petitioner be released
from the asylum.
Effect of the Decision.
The effect of the decision will be to
place all persons who have been commit
ted to the various asylums for the insane
in the State since 1897 in a position to
successfully apply for -writs of habeas
corpus. In this city alone the commit
ments numbered from twenty-live to one
hundred people a month. Other counties
of, the State have sent a proportional
number to the asylums at Napa, Stock
ton, Ukiah and Agnews. Of course the
decision applies to only such persons now
confined in the asylums whose liberty
would not be a menace to the lives and
welfare of others. In cases of insane
persons with homicidal manias, whoso
liberty . would be fruitful of harm, the
court might order their temporary deten
tion until the Legislature could enact a
law not in conflict with the constitutional
rights of citizens or. until â  a legal com
mission in lunacy might be convened.
The spirit cf the decision quoted is to
give every man charged with being insane
the right of trial by jury and the addi
tional right to offer testimony in his own
defense. . It is because of the lack ,of
these requirements that the law of 1897
has been declared unconstitutional. The
law did not provide the proper machinery
for depriving insane people of their lib
erty, and in the eyes of the law an ex
parte examination by which any one is
deprived of his constitutional rights Is of
no effect.
Under the act of 1897- there have been
four .physicfcinsy appointed by the Supe
rior Judges, who served alternately each
month as Commissioners of â¢ Lunacy
in this city. .The fee in each case exam
ined, whether the accused is committed
or not. is $5 for each physician. : The'
Commissioners are usually employed -' an 1
hour each day < and their compensation
rarely averages less "than $150 a month.'
Their demands are presented to the Su
pervisors, and after being passed upon
by the Finance Committee are sent to
the Auditor. They are then audited and
paid by the Treasurer, v
I It Is quite likely that until his personal
liability .is. determined In the premises
the Auditor will audit no more demands
of the Commission of Lunacy. < The out
cqme of the tangle will be watched with
interest by the attorneys and public gen
erally. â¢ v_ ., . ;

Commerce File a
Protest.
A special meeting of the board of trus
tees of the Chamber of Commerce was
held yesterday afternoon to act upon the
report of the committee on foreign com
merce and revenue laws, to which the
matter of trade relations between the
United States and Cuba had been re
ferred. President George A. Newhall pre
sided. The board authorized the president
to sign a petition to the California J dele
gation in Congress to use its best efforts
to induce Congress to maintain the coast
wise shipping laws between the United
States and the Philippine Islands, which
provide that all trade between the islands
and the United States shall be in vessels
carrying the American flag. It was also
decided that ,the president should tele
graph William M. Bunker, the permanent
representative of the Chamber of Com
merce in Washington, to confer with the.
California delegates in an endeavor to
have the present duties on rope and man
ufactured cigars coming into this country
from the Philippine Islands maintained.
The board indorsed the resolutions of the
National Rivers and Harbors - Congress
which will be presented to Congress by a
committee of twenty-two, composed of
delegates from each State represented at
the Harbor Congress in Baltimore, the
object of the resolutions being to impress
upon the National Congress the urgent
necessity of providing ample funds In the
rivers and harbors bill for the proper im
provement of rivers and waterways.
The following resolution adopted by the
board was telegraphed to Mr. Bunker at
Washington at the conclusion of the
meeting, with a request that a copy be
given to each member of the California
delegation: 'â¢ " ' â 
Whereas, Strenuous efforts are now being:
made for the establishment of reciprocal trade
relations between the United States and Cuba;
and whereas, such trade relations would seri
ously injure the agricultural and horticultural
industries of . California and â  other States;
therefore be it â¢
Resolved, That the Chamber of Commerce of
San Franciaco hereby earnestly protests against

LOCATES WRECK
OF SAN RAFAEL
Captain Rogers Fastens
Drag on Sunken
Ferryboat. .
The wreck of the San Rafael has been
located and lost again several times. Now
Captain H. J. Rogers and his assistants
are certain they have the reniains of the
vessel for good. Yesterday they were out
on two of Crowley's launches and after
drifting for an hour the drag held. Then
the assistance of the Spreckels tug Relief
was called in and the remains of the ill
fated vessel were finally located. Regard
ing the belief that the wreck has been lo
cated Captain Silovich of the tug Relief
said:
I am certain we have located the remains of
the San Rafael. Our drag anchor held and the
nukes and chain are marked with white and
green paint. We were almost in a straight Hue
from the Alcatraz light to the gas works and
the hull lies In twenty fathoms of water.
There is fourteen fathoms over her, but on
each side of her there i3 a rail of about thirty
feet. She could not have drifted more than
a quarter of a mile after she collided with tbe
Sausalito before she went down.
Judging from our soundings she must be
lying on her side. I am sure they, have lo
cated her but whether the hull will ever be of
any use even if it is recovered I don't know.
The machinery is the best of its kind and is
well worth saving. .
Divers will /go down to-day and make sure,
but to my mind there Is no doubt that
they have the wreck. If it Is in the position
we think -then both the captains were wrong
in their calculations. .

MYSTERY RULES
COPPER MARKET
London Speculators Un
able to Fathom the
Affair.
LONDON, Dec. 13.â The directors of the
Rio Tintos Company have been meeting
here dally, though quite informally, since
the copper crisis became acute. It was
officially stated after to-day's meeting
that whatever settlement may be arrived
at now lies entirely with the Amalga
mated Copper Company. The Rio Tintos
Company has made all the propositions
which it intends to make, but so far has
received no indication of the action the
Amalgamated Copper Company proposes
to take. A feeling prevails that the con
ditions will not be altered at present.
The Pall Mall Gazette says that if Rock
efeller has really thrown down the gaunt
let to the Rothscnllds, which the paper
thinks improbable, there can be little
doubt of the Rothschilds' victory. .The
paper adds:
"The Rio Tintos Company is in a posi
tion to regard with equanamity a further
drop of 20 shillings per ton, but -not so
the Standard Oil Company, which has to
consider the possibility of a general
smash of the American market."
Rio Tintos fell three-eighths at the
opening to-day, but subsequently regained
this and slightly improved on last night's
price. The copper market is still gov
erned by jnysterious influences, the gene
sis of which even the dealers are unable
to understand. It is gaid to be remarka
ble that, in spite of the selling pressure,
coupled with the gloomy reports from.
New York, the price of the standard
grade has only shrunk three shillings per
ton. The first change in the price to-day
was when 1200 tons were soM at Â£52 for
all dates up to February 28, and at Â£51 6a
for the three months. The heaviest sell
ing was from a fresh quarter. It excited
curiosity, but no explanation was forth
coming. . *â¢â -;.
It is believed in many quarters that the
most important London houses consider
the present prices to be justified by the
great expansion ' and consumption of re
cent years, and thatj consequently, they
are willing to lay in considerable stock3

Companion of a Sus

Is Sentenced.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 13.â Laura Bullion, tha
female companion of Benjamin Kilpac
rick, the Montana train robber suspect,
who was yesterday convicted of having
in his possession forged national bank
notes, was to-day sentenced by United
States District Judge Adams to five years'
imprisonment In the Federal prison at
Leaven worth, Kans. Kilpatrick yester
day received a sentence of fifteen years'

F. D. Elliott, representing the Great
Northern Railroad, called at the Four
Courts and announced that one-third of
the $5000 offered by his company would be
awarded the six detectives who arrested
Kilpatrick, one of the alleged Great
Northefh train robbers. Twenty per cent
of this will go to the Police Relief Asso
ciation. This will leave a reward of $y)
each for Detectives A. L. Guiot, John Me

OF POLITICIANS
Bright Prospects for an
Unpledged State
Convention.
George Hatton Now Politi
cal Manager for Senator
George 0. Perkins.
At the hotels, clubs and other places
â¢where politicians happen to meet and In
cidentally epeaij of the coming State
campaign the opinion is generally ex
pressed that a large majority of Repub
lican delegates will go to the convention
free and unpledged. The change of sen
timent in this regard since the muAfipal
election in San Francisco is remarkable.
Among the active advocates of an anti
programme State convention are Republi
cans -who were formerly classed as out
and out followers of the Herrln-Gaee-
Lynch machine.
The sentiment In the party in favor of
adjusting all differences on the floor of
the convention and giving every candi
date for the gubernatorial nomination
free rein for an* open contest is wide
spread. It is the judgment of the wisest
politicians that the rank and file of the
party will not stand for programme nom
inations. The voters may abide by the
result of an open light in the convention,
* J" u not con sent to secret settlement
Â° \.< th^ e contest in advance. The system
which allows two or three men to sit
down In the Palace Hotel and prepare a
list of nominations for the convention to
indorse has been played to a finish so far
as the Republican party of California is
concerned.
Exhibits Independence.
San Francisco, the banner county 'of
the State, gave an exhibition of independ
ent voting at the late municipal election
which may be accepted as an index of
what other Republican counties will offer
in the event of raw programme work in
the State convention. At the present
time the list of available men in the Re
publican party for Governor embraces the
names of E. F. Preston, Thomas Flint
Jr., Henry T. Gage, E. B. Edson, Harold
T. Power, John F. Davis, E. C. Voorhels
George C. Pardee, Jacob H. Neff, Victor
H. Metcalf, N. P. Chlpman, George Stone.
Frank H. Short and Van R. Paterson
The Democratic list Includes the names
of Washington Dodge, Mayor Snyder of
Los Angeles. William T. Jeter, Senator
Sims. R. H. Beamer. Ed E. Lcake, James
D. Phelan and Thomas J. Geary.
The Republicans will settle the fight for
the United States Senatorship, as the
Democrats cannot hope to elect a suffi
cient number of Senators and Assembly
men to overcome the holdover strength
cf the Republicans. It Is no longer a
secret that George Hatton is the politica'
manager of George C. Perkins in the lat
ter's candidacy to succeed himself in the
United States Senate. Opposition to Per
kins' re-election, which does not appear
formidable at present, may develop later
on. No doubt Hatton will keep him post
ed and perhaps advise him to beware of
a too close alliance with the Gage-Herrin-
Lynch machine.
Senator Bard Was Advised.
It is reported on the best of authority
that Dr. Rowell at the earnest request o*f
Lieutenant Governor Neff and Harold T.
Power urged Senator Bard not to op
pose the recommendation of William S.
Graham for United States Surveyor Gen
eral, District of California- The argu
ment was advanced that Northern Cali
fornia was recognized when J. M. Glea>-es
was appointed and that the recognition
should be continued by the appointment
of Mr. Graham. Senator Bard was ad
vised . against weakening his position in
anbtfier direction by Insisting on the ap
pointment of ex-Senator Boyce of Santa
Barbara to the Surveyor Generalship.
There was a conference of some of Sena
tor Bard's friends at the Union League
Club in this city recently and there the
points involved were considered. MeES
asres were sent by wire to the Senator,
and a reply was received which indicated
that the advice was regarded as prudent
and timely.
Major Frank McLaughlln, who left here
seven months ago for New York, returned
to the city last night. He goes to Santa
Cruz to-day.

on here and there they carried out the
plan. . ~- .
Every debutante of the Â£ season was
present.
Mrs. Brigham and her two daughters
were exquisitely gowned in white. They
received the guests without assistance
and were equal to the occasion.
A new ballroom was especially built for
the occasion. Although there were two
large rooms that could be opened Into a
ballroom it 'was deemed advisable to add
another and larger room.
The house was decorated in an artistic
manner, many American Beauty roses,
ferns and palms being used.
The guests began to arrive at 9 o'clock,

CONFER ON BOND
ISSUE MATTERS
Merchants and Supervi
sors Meet in a Joint
Session.
Continuous Matinee Perform
ance by the Judiciary
Committee.
The Judiciary Committee .of. the Board
of Supervisors gave a continuous per
formance yesterday afternoon with other
Supervisorial committees and a delegation
of the Merchants* Association. The star
act of the day was the joint ' meeting of
the ' Judiciary and Public Utilities com
mittees with the merchants for a discus
sion of the bond issue appropriations to
be presented, to the voters for ratification
at a special election. ;.; ; .'Â« â ,
Mayor Phelan was on hand, the Firo
Commissioners, .were- there, and also
merchants and manufacturers. They dis
cussed the city's needs, the practicability
of admitting certain appropriations on
the special bond, issue, and came to a
general understanding on what the ciiy
ought to have by the issuance of bonds
instead of the old-time method of Super
visorial appropriation. In certain In
stances definite conclusions were reached,
but in the majority of cases suggestion
and advisement .were the sum limit of
work done.
After the -matter of Justice Daniels*
courtroom was adjusted and the.commit
tee agreed that Judge Dunne should go
to the Hall of Justice for M3 courtroom,
the merchants filed in and took seats
around the long table preparatory to
their heart to heart talks on the bond is
sue. Supervisor Brandenstein was the
chairman and- Frank J. Symmes repre
sented the Merchants' Association.-
Views of the Merchants.
Symmes said that the Merchants' Asso
ciation felt that it .'was not prepared to
express itself fully on the question of pub
lic improvements. The committee of
merchants was in accord with the Super
visorial committee in regard to beautifv
lng the .city by public parks. In regard
to the sewer system the merchants are
still in doubt. It is the sense of the
merchants, he said, that the City and
County Hospital occupy its present site.
The addition to Lafayette Park, which
would cost $200,000, was deemed extrava
gant and unnecessary.
Ex-Mayor Pond was In favor of issuine
bonds for street improvements, but talked
against additional bonds for the park In
vehement terms. The St. Mary's PariÂ«
apportionment did not receive the mer
chants' approval.
In regard to the $2,055,000 allowance for
schools and sites, the merchants were
generally in favor of it.
The price asked for the Mechanics* In
stitute property was adjudged unwarrant
ed and the suggestion made that the Lin
coln school property be used for the ii
brary. . . . .
Much argument was indulged in when
tne lelegrapn Hill improvement appro
priation of 1554,020 came up for consider
ation. Engineer Grunsky was called to
explain the tunnel scheme, but no definite
recommendation was made.
Argument on Streets.
By far the most keenly -debated ques
tion during the conference related to the
Improvement of streets. The Merchants'
Association recommended the insertion
among the declaratory bills of a $1,000,000
appropriation for the repavement of
streets. â 
Mayor Phelan argued that as street im
provement was altogether different from
permanent improvement no appropriation
should be. made. by the bond issue.
Frank Symmes said the streets were
"so far behind In condition that we should
do something to catch up." . . .
The committeemen then argued until
their throats were dry, and the matter
went over â¢ until the next conference,
which will be on Friday next.
Charles Wesley Reed was strong in his
demands: for a street improvement ap
propriation, while Mayor Phelan quoted
figures to show that the streets could be
Improved from time to time out of the
current revenue. Third street was cited
by the merchants as a most deplorable
thoroughfare, and was made the moral of
the tale.
The Fire Commissioners adjusted their
difficulties without much waste of tim<_\
Rolla V. Watt and Colonel Hecht present
ed claims for a $350,000 bond issue for the
Fire Department. They wanted eight cr
nine new houses and general sanitary im
provements in all but a very few of the

South End Hen Lose.
The Payne estate and South End Row
ing Club controversy was considered
when the Judiciary and Street committees
met in joint session. Alfred Wheeler, rep
resenting the Payne estate,, said that. the
South End Rowing Club had pre-empted
a site on Third street eighteen years ago
and blocked' the street, to the detriment
of property owners. On' the facts tlie
committees favored a removal of the ob
struction and passed a resolution to that
effect. The matter will come up before
the Board on Monday. . --â¢
Then came a lonely meeting of the
Judiciary Committee, Brandenstein and
Comte being. present. The Grand Jury
had sent in a communication that the
theater ordinance was not being obeyed,
so the clerk was ordered to notify the
police to that effect. The committee ruled
on the high fence ordinance, receiving
with favor the. opinion of. the City Attor
ney that violation of the fence ordinance
was a criminal offense.

Operations if or Ovarian Troubles In-
.';.': creasing in Our Hospitals.
Mrs.; Eckis Stephenson of Salt^ak^City Tells How
1 Operations May Be Avoided.
The nniversal indications of the approach of woman's great.enemy,
mation and' disease of the ovaries, are a dull throbbing pain, accompanied by a
sense of tenderness, and heat low down in the side with occasional shooting pains.
On examination it may be found that the region of, pain will show some
swelling. This is the first stage of ovaritis, or. inflammation of the ovaries.
1 If the roof of yonr house leaks,- mydear sister, you' have it fixed'at once ;
why not pay the same respect to yotir .body?; .. Keglecf and. the dreadful
surgeon's knife go hand in hand. How many tBbusancfo of our poor suffering'
sisters might have escaped the hospital and its dreadful experiences if they
had only done as the lady w.hose portrait and letter we are permitted to
publish. Oh, what more can we do to make women believe. * â  '
MRS. ECKIS STEPHENSON,
State Chairman Young Peoples' Temperance Union, Salt Lake City, Utah.
. "Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â I suffered with inflammation of tha
ovaries and womb for over six years, enduring aches and'pains which
nonfe can dream of but those who have had the same experience. Hun-
.dreds of dollars went to the doctor and tb.e druggist I was simply a
walking medicine chest and a physical wreck. Sly sister residing in
Ohio wrote me she had been cured of womb trouble by using Jjydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, and advised me to try it. I then
discontinued all other medicines and gave your Vegetable Compound a
thorough trial. Within four weeks nearly all pain had- left me ; I rarely
had headaches, and my nerves were in a much better condition, and I
was cured in three months, and thus avoided a terrible surgical opera-
tion.'' â Mrs. Eckis Stephenson, 250 So. State St., Salt Lake City, Utah.
Another Operation Avoided in Philadelphia.
*' Dear Mrs.. Pixkham : â Some time ago I was taken very sick with pains
caused by internal trouble, (ovarian) and was unable to attend to my house-
hold duties. I consulted several doctors but got no relief. They advised
an operation which I was almost tempted to. undergo when I read in the
paper of the wonderful cures Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
was making. So I began taking it and now after taking several bottles feel
like a new woman. Is o praise is too great for it. It is woman's friend and
no woman should be without it." â Mbs. Lizzie Milnee, 1616 Taniata St.,
Philadelphia, Pa.
Remember, every woman is cordially invited to write to Mrs.
Pinkham if there is anything about her symptoms she does not
understand. Mrs. Pinkham's address is Lynn, Mass., her advice
is free and cheerfully given to every ailing woman who asks for
it. .Her advice has restored to health more than one hundred
thousand women. "Why don't you try it, my sick sisters ?

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â Stocks scored quite
a notable recovery in to-day's market. The
market was very irregular during the early
part of the day and distinctly weak In spots.
This was due to the residue of uneasiness com
ing over from yesterday's events and the fear
that money stringency would develop during
the day incident to the carrying over of loans
until Monday. Borrowers on call paid as high
as 8% per cent early In the day, but they had
no difficulty j n obtaining accommodations at
the prevailing rates. There was no further
calling of loans by the banks or forcing of
liquidation in comsequence. as was the case yes
terday The call loan rate yielded as the larger
demands were satisfied and fell below 6 nW
cent at the c;o?e. Perceiving the course things
were taking the bears be?an to buy to cover
their short contracts, which had been consid
erably extended in yesterday's decline. There
was some buying also by inside Interests In
the various stocks, especially during the morn
ing, for the purpose of support. Under these
influences prices began to recover and touched
the high level of the day during the afternoon.
This level was not fully maintained, but tht
closing was steady and dull, only a traction
below the top level. Yesterday's anxiety over
tne rumors circulated of the embarrassment oÂ£
a large international mercantile house was re
lieved by assurances that the trouble was tided
over This was a factor in the recovery except
tor the rubber goods stocks and United States
Rubber, which lost from 1 to 4 points The
preliminary figures of the week's mov.'-moius
?>L C^ Pfomlfeed. a loss of upward of $(1,000.
000 for the banks, but the easier tone of the
money market hilped to a more hopeful senti
ment over the future. In the late strength of
the market, gains of 1 to 2 ooints were estab
lished among the local tractions, trunk lineÂ«

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW 'YORK, Dec. 13.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
It is most fortunate that the vagaries of specu
lation are not always deleterious to legitimate
business. Railway stocks fell sharply, yet full
returns for November show that earnings were
11.5 per cent greater than In the same month
last year and 11. S per cent over those of 1809.
Industrial and traction shares were even more
violently disturbed, yet the manufacturing
plants of the nation were never more j fully
occupied. Numerous labor controversies haye
been settled and tlie rate of wages is at the
highest point ever attained. Retail distribu
tion is of massive proportions, with dealings
in holiday goods the conspicuous feature. This
class of business so far surpasses all previous
records that it alone gives an unmistakable
indication of the nation's prosperity, even if
other more definite measures were not avail
able. Conditions in the leading industry are
stiH most strikingly promising. Despite the
full engagements of most of . the . steel mills
well into next year the week- has brought a
large amount of new business, particularly in
railway equipment. Stability of prices con
tinues the best feature. Reports from the
great iron centers during the closing week of
November dwelt upon the scarcity of cars and
motive powers, implying that furnaces could
not secure coke and were going out of blast
while pig iron could not be moved from the
yards to the mill. Hence it was generally ex
pected that the output would show a- material
decrease while : furnace . stocks of iron . were
thought to be somewhat augmented.' Instead
the Iron Age' has issued a most encouraging
report of 200 furnaces in blast on December 1,
with a capacity of 324,761 tons weekly.
Western grain producers and dealers have
expressed great faith In the future of prices,
many announcing their intention to hold their
supplies until spring, when the scarcity would
be marked and quotations reach a more profit
able point. â  ' ':â¢â â 
Bradstreefs on Trade.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13. â Bradstreet's to-mor
row .will 6ay: Holiday trade 1 B in full swing
at all markets, while jobbing distribution
naturally shows a quieting down . preparatory
to stock taking. Nearly all advices touching
these latter branches of business are. encourag
ing; and the year's results, so far as ascer
tained, are on the whole very favorable. Among
the Industries iron -and steel =are easily first
in strength of demand and prices and the word
buoyant about accurately describes the situa
tion as regards the feeling In" the trade gen
erally. Though strong this : trade is â  still con
servative as a whole, as . evidenced by : the
pegging of Iron ore (old range) quotations for
the coming year at. old prices in the face of
a temptation to advance that and finished pro
ducts. â¢ Probably never- before ,wa 8 so much
business hooked in . advance aÂ» - there ' Is at
present in pig iron, rails and finished products
The -former is in better demand and $16 can
be had at valley furnaces, though $15 25 is the
nominal rate. . Production is at an unheard
â¢of/ rate, despite car shortage stopping coke de
liveries and stocks of : pig iron â¢ are still de
creasing. < <â¢ . - .
The crest of the recent rise in cereals was
for the present. reached on Saturday last for
coarse grains and on : Monday,' . December , 9,
for wheat and provisions. The 'proportions* of
the recent rise " Induced ' enormous realizing,

movement â¢ and . Increases in visible supplies.
added to the - : freaking of the drouth , in the
South and the * tightness of money, left the
beats masters 6f the field. The steady. rise in
wheat and corn prices shown in the early part
of .November had resulted in a gain of about
13c each in wheat and corn, from which the
rail this week is only about 3 cents. . Provisions
sympathized with the movement and the high
price of low-grade foodstuffs is still a feature
of note. ; .
Woolen "goods are in good demand, particu
larly, for dresp wear, and many mills are busy,
on heavy-weight orders. Wool is strong, though
unchanged, on good demand, slightly higher,
on Merinos and unchanged on crossbreds.
Boot and. shoe manufacturers are still busily
employed and shipments still heavily exceed
last year. Leather Is firm and while hides are
easier tanners are not anxious to buy largely.
Higher prices of cereals check our export
trade in that direction and shipments of bread
stuffs, live animals, cotton and ojls all de
creased from October totals.- Compared with
November a year ago provisions, cottons and
oil exports are all heavier. â¢ â¢ â  "' .
Wheat shipments in November were 50 per
cent larger. For the calendar year 1901 ship
ments of breadstuffs, animals, cotton oils and
provisions aggregate a sum 5 per cent larger
than in any previous year. -
Wheat, including flour, exports for the week
aggregate :5 t 879,809 bushels, against 4,604.046
bushels last week and 4,785,577 bushels in this
week' last year.
Wheat exports/July 1 to date (twenty-four
weeks), aggregate 136,303,715 bushels, against
84,060,729 bushels last season.- i
Business failures in the United States for
the week number 233, against 237 last week
and 247 in this week a year ago.
Canadian "failures, for the week number 23,
or the same number as last week and 'com
pared with 18 in this week a year ago.

Chicago Grain Market.
* : __*
CHICAGO, Dec. 13.â Wheat crept back
slowly into the eighties to-day. The absence
of Liverpool cables and the heavy fall of snow
and rain throughout' .the country kept, th*
talent guessing. London was rather weak in
tone, and though the winter wheat belt got a
good soaking, the approach of blizzards was
much feared. Other conditions early were
bearish. â  The cash demand was slow, receipts
were Kberal , and clearances small. St. Louis
reported a continental .inquiry, but in general
the early trade <vas Â«f the selling kind. May
opened unchanged to %c up at 79 %c to 79 %c,
but soon sold down to 79c. At this price shorts
covered freely and some professionals began to
acquire lines of long wheat again. The
weather report frightened holders and trade
toward the close became .'brisk.. Prices re
acted well and May advanced to 80%c, closing
strong, %Â«. higher, at 80%c.
Corn was fairly active, making gains and

New York Metal Market.
NEW TORK, Dec. 13.â The local copper
market Is demoralized. The ' Metals Selling
Company reduced prices l@1^4c to-day. The
street looks for a further reduction. â¢ It is said
that the' company has been making contracts
for a great deal of copper at prices even lower
than covered by to-day's reduction, j Everybody
seems ' to be at sea | regarding the future . of
the market. Reports current that the reduc
tion was made as a move in the copper stock
war . were denied by parties who are on the
inside. The decline was evidently made to try
to get prices down to a free selling level, or
In other words to a commercial basis. The
local prices are now as follows: Lake, $15 37%
@15 62 &; electrolytic, $15015 25; casting, $15.
The London copper market fell off 10s to-day,
thus making a new low record for recent years.
Spot and f utnres - were quoted at ' Â£S2. The
London market for pig tin was unchanged, but
the local market was about }Â£c higher, closing
at $24 85@25 12>,4. London tin closed with

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The foreign markets continued
â weak and there was less steam at Chicago,
though prices \ advanced lc. At the opening
Ne# York and St. Louis sold freely, consider
able' long Wheat was thrown on the market
and in addition there were a good many stop
orders at 79c, below which commission houses
had unlimited orders to buy. Later on the feel
ing changed and St. Louis and New York
bought freely, and the market advanced under
local speculative buying, the Southwest pur
chasing heavily and the shorts covering. St.
Louis reported good foreign buying and the
Chicago crowd appeared to be oversold. The
weather was wet with an extereme cold wave
coming. The Argentine crop showed decided
improvement. 'â

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been the following deliveries of coal -
Ten from Washington, 24,734 tons; three from
British Columbia, 6195 tons; two from Oregon
1150 tons; total 32,079 tons. Notwithstanding
the few arrivals from British Columbia, the
quantity received is ample for "our Immediate
needs A few cargoes of good domestic fuel
would ; find ready sale at a. profit, but steam
coal is offered by importers -at less than cost
without finding buyers. This is attributable
to the Inroads of fuel oil Into the market as a
steam producer, as it proves to be. more easily
handled, delivered as . needed and costs much
less than coal. The annual import 3 of coal
this year will compare favorably with last" Its
consumption will not. fall off more than about
10 per cent, notwithstanding there will be dis

MARK ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION
Sacred Heart Parish Prepares to Honor Pastor Who Has Guided
Members a Quarter of a Gentury and Select Day as Appro

OAKLAND. Dec. 13.â In celebration
of the silver anniversary of Sa
cred Heart parish the cornerstone
of the new church, which Is In
course of construction on For
tieth street, near Grove, will be laid Sun
day afternoon at 3 o'clock. Archbishop P.
4 VT. Riordan of San Francisco will of-
J^nciate, with the assistance of the Catholic
clergy from both sides of the bay.

SABIN RETURNS
FROM CHICAGO
Tells of Improvements
in the Telephone
System.
John I. Sabin. who left this city last
.April to assume the presidency of the
Telephone Company. arrived
Lome last night to spend Christmas with
his family. During his official career in
the Windy City President Sabin succeeded
in effecting many important improve
ments in the Chicago telephone system.
I'Tider his supervision the system was
greai.lv extenaed and the conaition of the
operators improved. He will return to
Chicago after Christmas.
In speaking of the Chicago telephone
system last nigbt President Sabin taid:
The Chicago telephone field Is unsurpassed
ty any in the United fetates. There are 40,wo
lihones in use there at present and prepara
tions have been made lor increasing that num
ijf.r to lOU.OUO within the next two year*. In
the Chiearo and Central Union Telephone Â£>â¢Â»
ttms wttnln the last teven months there lias
been a. net gain ot 3O,UOO telephones, or an
increase equal to the entire number of phone*
in ut>e in ban Francisco.
I have 2W),0<jO stations under my charge;
1 10 feOO on the Pacific Coast. 50,000 In the Chi
cago Company and IOO.OOu In the Central Union
Conpeoy. 'Abe iatter company has its Held
in Illinois. Indiana and Ohio.
The service in Chicago it. unexcelled. Vie
naturally look after the welfare of our operat
ors as it is through them that the company
comee in contact with the public. I regard
the expansion of the telephone as bounded unly
by the education of the people. In Chicago
we are introducing the telephones into restau
rants and other public places. I believe the
time will come when the phone will be con
bldered indispensable Uj a home or to a busi
ness bouse.
I'eople are sraduallj- beingr educated up to
llie etiquette of the telephone. When the
Mcycie and the automobile first made their
Bppearanceg people did not know how to re
ceive them. They did not know what rights
â¢Â« w8j- to assign to them on the public etreets.
Â£â  as the public became accustomed to these
'7n\iern Improvements in locomotion ;t learned
the proper way to treat them. So It will be
with the telephone. The time will come when
a patron will not think of making a poor tel
ephone trirl'm life miserable becauae the hap
pen* to inake a mistake in a switch. He will
treat hÂ«r as politely as he would a girl whu
eerves him in a store.
In Chicago we make 600,000 switches in a
day and only about 500 mistakes are made.
Considering the vast number of switches that
are made I think that it is marvelous that eo
few mistakes ere made. The record is about
b* near perfection a* man can make it.

FUGITIVE SAILS
FROM VERA CRUZ
Advices Report Fleish
man to Be on Gulf
of Mexico.
Dispatches 1 Say That He Is
En Route to Republic
of Honduras.
Special Dispatch to The CaH.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 13.â While local
detectives who have charge of. the searcu
for Henry J. Fleisljman. the absconding
cashier of the Farmers' and Merchants'
Bank, are maintaining secrecy regarding
the progress of their quest, it leaked out
to-night that advices have been received
that the fugitive is now well on his way
down the coast to some Central or South
American port. Rumor has it that these
advices are official and that the cashier
was traced aboard a steamship leaving
Vera Cruz for the south. His destination
is presumed to be Honduras, between
which republic and the United States
there is no extradition treaty. As ii is
likely that. Fleishman posted himself in
regard to extradition treaties and other
conditions while planning his flignt, and
as his destination was at first believed to
be Vera Cruz, to-night's report lincis ready
belief.
, The statement that Fleishman has
sailed from Vera Cruz does not conflict
with the known facts concerning his Jour
ney, It is not likely that, after he met
and was recognized by Mr. Bhanks, he
would continue on to Guadalajara,' as ne
said he would. Had he gone on to Guad
alajara he would have reached there on
Wednesday morning. If he turned at
Aguas Catiente* and made connections
for Tamplco or Vera Cruz he could have
reached the former, port on Wednesday
evening and the latter the following day.
There are at least seven lines of steam
ers sailing from Tampico, but Fleishman's
friends believe he would have kept away
from that port, as there are a number of
Angelenos living there and Fleishman
was well aware of this factt
EL PASO. Tex., Dec. 13.â Fleishman,
the absconding Los Angeles cashier, was
due to leave Guadalajara to-day by stage
for Tepic had he followed his original
plan. Three stages per week- run from
Guadalajara to Tepic, and from the latter
place he was expected 1 to go by boat to
the seaport town of -
Officers here are thoroughly convinced
that Fleishman is in Mexico, but the
Chief of Police expresses the opinion that
the Los Angeles authorities are not anxi
ious to apprehend the fugitive. As an
evidence of this he oites the fact that he
has not yet been officially notified to ar
rest Fleishman, except -by a detective
agency in San FranciscoJ Not one word
has come to him from the Los Angeles
Chief of Police. Constable Thomas Ben
dy, who proposed to pursue and capture
Fleishman if his expenses â were paid, re
ceived a telegram to-day saying that a
reward had been posted, but no mention
was made of the expense money.
DIRECTOR MARK ADMITS
THAT HE IS PREJUDICED
Director C. W. Mark of the Board of
Education admitted to Judge Hunt yes
terday that he had made the remark ac
credited to him by Stephen V. Costello
concerning the sanity of Miss Mary C.
McKinney and informed, the court that
he would not participate in the trial of
the lady onvthe charges preferred against
her by the principal of the school where
she taught. On this condition Judge Hunt
dismissed the writ of restraining the
Board of Education from trying Miss
McKinney, which was obtained on an af
fidavit accusing Mark of prejudice. â¢ â  â¢

ing her trial on the charge, was heard
by Judge Seawell yesterday. Miss Dwyer
testified that she was summoned from her
classroom July 22 by the principal anfl
notified that she was suspended. Judge

/ /-^s. AKLAND, Dec. 13.â The mystery
(t \V of the attempted suicide last
Vl If nl S nt from the ferry steamer Bay
x^Jr City has been solved. The
woman whose determined effort
at self-murder sent . thrills through the
passengers on the' 6:45 trip from San
Francisco was Mrs. Frank Kantz, 1011
Franklin street, Oakland. The little girl
whose presence of mind prevented the
tragedy was her 6-year-old daughter
Josie.
According to the despondent woman, her
husband, Frank Kantz* employed up to,
last Monday by the Contra Costa Water
Company, deserted , her and their child
last Saturday. Hearing that her husband
waa in San Francisco, Mrs. Kantz, ac
companied by her little daughter, crossed
the bay to find him. Unsuccessful in their
errand they were returning to Oakland,
when Mrs. Kantz made a determined at
tempt to commit suicide by jumping over
board through a window in the ladles'
dressing-room.

Jumped on her back, caught my arms around
her waist and tried to pull her !n.
Mamma said, "Don't, Josie. I can't live this
â¢way I'll be better, oft out there."
Then I stamped my foot and told mamma to
be 'shamed of herself: that it was dark and
cold and wet; that I was too little a; girl to
be left alone and she just must come home.
Mamma wouldn't stop, though. She turned
around and kissed me and tried again to get
through the window. I took hold of her shirts
and Just screamed and hollered till a lpt of
ladles came in and Just made mamma go into
the saloon. ' â  -
Then I went and found Mr. George Carr. who
lives in the same house with us. He took us

MIDNIGHT RIOT
IN DANCE HALL
Drunken Soldiers Wreck
Pacific-Street
Resort.
Policeman Nelson Narrowly
Escapes Death at Hands
of a Mob.
A mob of about forty soldiers of the
Fifteenth Cavalry, which is stationed at
the* Presidio preparatory to being sent to
Manila, went on a wild rampage on Pa
cific street shortly after 13 o'clock last
night. They todk possession of the Camp
Fire Dance Hall at 519 Pacific street and
completely wrecked the place. Officer
Nelson, who bravely attempted to combat
the mob single-handed, had a narrow
escape from being killed. . . -
The unrestrained soldiers in their drunk
en fury entered the dance hall and drove
out the -â  proprietor. Officer Nelson, on
Jjearlng the uproar, ran to the scene. He
was surrounded by" the drunken soldiers,
who were too frenzied to be quelled by a
single policeman, and forced back against
the walL The soldiers struck at him with
broken billiard cues | and broken chairs.
Only the arrival of a number of policemen
saved Nelson from being killed.
While part of the mob held Nelson at
bay the rest completely destroyed tho
furnishings of the dance hall. The bar
was overturned, Dottles were broken and
the liquor spilled about the floor, billiard
cues were smashed and the soldiers pulled
the chairs to pieces so as to obtain clubs
with which to continue their wanton
demolition. Nothing escaped their fury.
A young man who happened to be in
the dance hall and witnessed the plight
of Policeman Nelson ran for assistance.
He informed Officer Peters of the trouble.
Peters turned in the riot call. A squad of
policemen under the. command -of Ser
geant Donovan were hurried to Pacific
street from the Hall of Justice. They suc
ceeded in driving the mob back and res
cued Officer Nelson, who escaped serious
Injury.
The officers piled their clubs with good
effect and very few of the drunken ma
rauders escaped with sound heads. Twen
ty-eight of the mob were arrested and
taken to the Hall of Justice. They will
be charged with disturbing the peace.
Officer Naylor stood at the head of the
steps leading from the dance hall and
used his fists in suppressing the soldiers.
The 'dance hall after the mob had been
dispersed looked as though it had been
swept by a Kansas cyclone.

requires physical and mental
ability of a . high degree to
. withstand its hard labors. The
high tension to which the
nervous system is constantly
' subjected, has a depressing ef-
fect, and soon headache, back-
ache, neuralgia, rheumatism,
sciatica, etc., develop in severe
form. ' Such Was the case of
Mail Carrier S. F. Sweinhart,
of Huntsyille, Ala., he says:
' "An attack of pneumonia left me
with muscular rheumatism, headache,
and pains that seemed to be all over
me. I was scarcely able to move for
about a month when I decided to give '
m?,:;. Pain Pills
and Nerve Plasters a trial. In three
x days I was again on my route and In
two weeks I was free from pain and -
gaining in flesh and strength.

Snow Falls in El Cajon Val
ley for- Third Time in
' Its History.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
LOS- ANGELES, Dec. 13.â The lowest
point the mercury has- reached around
Los : Angeles Is 31 degrees. Citrus fruit
has not suffered in the cold snap that has
prevailed since Wednesday. Confidential
reports from agents, received by the
Southern California Fruit Exchange to
day, were to the effect that there had
been no damage. The wind prevailing
last night and at an early hour this morn
ing saved the citrus fruit. At the office
of the | Fay Fruit Company it was said
that .while there had been some alight
damage lp' certain sections, the prange
crop had not suffered perceptibly. The
Earl Fruit' Company reports no damage
as far as heard frpm. The Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific unite in saying that tne
cold snap has npt been productive of
harm. The temperature was lowest in
the vicinity of Santa Ana and the south
ern coast section, where the mercury fell
to 29 degrees..
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 13.â This section ,is
experiencing the coldest weather that has
been known here in years. In low places
in the valleys and along the coast there
was -a slight frost last . night. In San
IMego the weather bureau reports a min
imum temperature of 35 degrees, but that
is at the weather station at the tdp of
the Keating block. It was cooler than
that on the street below and much colder
at the sea leveL White frost was seen
on the wooden sidewalks, a new sight for
San Diegans. . In Mission Valley, at Na
tional and at Chula Vista the vegetable
gardens were quite badly frost bitten, and
there was some fear that oranges and
lemons might be affected disastrously,
but citrus fruits are not set out . In the
low places of the valleys and along the
coast and that is where the extremely
low temperature is always found. To
night seems as cold as last night and
orchardists fear for their trees. Snow, fell
this morning In El Cajon Valley for the
third time' in its. history. â 
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 13.â Sonoma County
has had very heavy frosts the last few
mornings, but it is generally believed
that they have been a help rather than a
detriment to the fruit. The warm rains
three and four weeks ago. advanced the
crops to such an extent as to alarm
farmers, but the frost will keep back the
buds. In the northern part of the county
it slightly damaged citrus fruit.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 13.â The frost this
morning did some damage to lettuce, caul
iflower and asparagus. While it thus af
fected tender garden plants and flowers,
reports received from the fruit growing
sections indicate that it has done no dam
age to the citrus fruits. Weather Ob
server Scarr had warned the orchardists
and gardeners of the. approach of. . the
frost, and in consequence they were pre
pared to meet it and minimize its effects, j
The state of the atmosphere to-night
would point to more frost in the morning.
REDWOOD CITY, Dec. 13.â For several
nights past this neighborhood has been
experiencing very cold weather. This
morning . the ravages of frost could be
seen on every hand. Gardens were blight
ed and young vegetables killed. Consider
able harm has also been done to pastur
age, which was becoming very luxuriant.
The^frost lasted until well along in the
day. To-night gives promise of" being as
; cold as last night, and another severe
frost is looked for.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 13.â The ground
this morning was white with frost. The
early hours were - the - - coldest recorded
this season." The standpipes about the
city were frozen and have bursted, and
from many residences come reports that
water pipes are frozen. The sky is clear,
and, though there is a slight wind, the air
is e'xceedingly cold and frosty.
SALINAS, Dec: 13.â There have been
killing frosts In this vicinity the past
three nights. The minimum temperature
registered was 28 ' degrees. Orchardists
are pleased, as this will have the effect of
keeping back the buds and young shoots
which were forming under the last warm
spell. Although ice formed in many
places, no damage is reported except to
light vegetables and flower beds. Beet
gathering Is progressing finely.
PACIFIC GROVE, Dec. 13.â This entire
section was visited by frost last night.
Tender plants and shrubs were affected,
but no material damage is reported. The
weather for the past forty-eight hours
was the coldest of the season.

MILITIA INCURS
THEIR CRITICISM
Labor Delegates Talk of
the and
v Strikes.
SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 13.-Thp conven
tion of the American â¢ Federation of . La
bor held three sessions to-day arid dis
posed of more business than on any pre
vious day. of the meeting. One of the
principal features of to-day's proceedings
was the refusal of the proposition to in
crease the number of vice presidents from
six to eight. . ' '
A resolution instructing unions to hold
aloof from the militia of the several
States was tabled. Strong language
against the militia in times of strikes was
used. The convention decided to increase
the per capita tax of national and inter
national unions from one-third to one
half of 1 per cent per member per month,
and also organized to raise the per cap
ita, tax of Federal and local trade unions
from 5 to 10 cents a month for each mem
ber, the increase of 5 cents to go toward
the raising of a defense fund for those
unions. ' . ' â¢
The convention decided to taJse no ac
tion on a. resolution condemning anarchy
and a resolution protesting against ship
subsidy legislation, because the American
Federation of Labor is already on record
as decidedly against anarchy and ship
subsidies. The federation decided to drop
the resolution denouncing the English
Government for its war against the
Boers, because the American Government
is now engaged In 1 a movement of a simi
lar character, and Because such a reso
lution has no place in a labor convention.
These resolutions were adopted:
Instructing the president to telegraph a
protest of the American federation of
Labor to the President of the United
States against the confirmation of the ap
pointment of Frauds Baker as Judge of
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals in Indiana, on the ground that his
father, Judge John H. Baker, had grant
ed injunctions against union workmen; in
structing the legislative committee to In
vestigate the report that the immigrant's
killed in the railroad wreck near Seneca,
Mich., recently were brought to this
country In violation of the immigration
laws. . â¢
Consideration of the report of the com
mittee on boycotts consumed much of
the time of the evening session. There
was a struggle over the matter of boy
cotting a cash register company of Ohio.
The company was placed upon the "un
fair" list by a. large vote.

ADOLPH OPPENHEIMER'S SLAYER
IS NOW KNOWN TO THE POLICE
Detectives Searching for Intoxicated Stranger Who Wandered Into
the Shooting Gallery, Accidentally Gave the Proprietor His
Death Wound and Then Fled in Fear of Consequences
THE police have evidence of the
identity of the slayer of.Adolph
Oppenheimer, the shooting-gal
lery proprietor who was killed
Thursday night at his place cf
business, 416 Dupont street, and expect to
have him in custody before many hours
have elapsed. The man who fired the
fatal shot was intoxicated and the deed
was accidental, wholly without premedi
tation or malice.
Until the arrest is made the detectives â
Wren, Dlnan and Whitakerâ are con
cealing the name of the man whom they
are seeking.
The four soldiers â who entered the gal
lery immediately after the shooting, and
who supposed Oppenheimer had fallen
asleep, were George Weiss, Martin Dun
bar, Louis Mehringer and Frank Cor
neliusen. They reported the fact to the
police and were interviewed at the Pre
sidio yesterday afternoon by the detect
ives. An intoxicated stranger was in the
gallery at the same time, but it is not be
lieved that he was the man who shot Op
penheimer. ;
Oppenheimer's cashbox, with about $6 in
It, was found yesterday afternoon when
the detectives made a search of the gal
lery. It was on a chair, where it had
been placed by Patrolman Brady, and
covered with a newspaper soon after the
shooting. The supposed disappearance of
the box was responsible for the robbery
theory. When the body was searched at
the Morgue $25 45 was found in the pock
ets of the clothing.
The autopsy showed death to have re
sulted from hemorrhage of the lungs.
The bullet, of twenty-two-callber short,
had entered the body four inches from
the epine, passed through the eighth rib
on the left side and had ranged down
ward through the lung and into the stom
ach. No powder marks showed on the
clothing. The police regard the wound as
remarkable, for ordinarily a bullet of
that caliber would have been deflected by
the clothing and rib and its velocity
checked to a degree that would have
made it comparatively harmless.
Captain Seymour and his subordinates
who investigated the caseâ Detectives
Dinan, Wren and Whittakerâ all held
that some careless or drunken man
â¢who. had wandered into the gallery fired
the shot accidentally, probably while
Oppenheimer was on his way toward the

have staggered back toward the counter
and sank to the : floor, â¢ his shoulder rest
ing against the wall, in which position
the body of the dying man was discov
ered. Frightened at what he had done,
the police believe, the stranger, put down
the rifle and hastened away, fearful that
he would be held for murder, if. he gave
the alarm. â  . . â. â 
Morris Oppenheimer, the 16-year-old son
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1901.
of the slain man, was studying in a room
just above the gallery. About 11:30
o'clock, he says, he heard a single shot,
a muffled groan and a few quick steps.
He thought his father was putting some
unwelcome visitor out. A few minutes
later he heard several, men enter and say,
"Wake up, old man, this is no place to
sleep." He heard no response from his
father, and when after firing six or seven
shots at the targets the visitors departed,
one saying "Let him sleep if he wants
to." the son hurried downstairs to inves
tigate and found his father dying.
Oppenheimer was 47 years old. He for
merly conducted a little jewelry store at
405 Dupont street. During the Durrant
trial he identified Durrant as the man
who had tried to pledge the Lamont ring
to him. His testimony was one of the
strong links in the chain of evidence.
Prior to Oppenheimer's going on the
stand he received an anonymous letter
offering him $250 If he would not make
his identification of Durrant positive and
threatening his life if he. should so make
it or if he should report the receipt of
the letter to the police. None of the po
lice, however, believe that the tragedy
of Thursday night had "any connection
with .the Durrant case.
Oppenheimer is the fourth important
witness in that case to die. Mrs. Leake
and Mrs. . Crossett died from natural
causes, and . Starr Dare, son of United
States Appraiser John T. Dare, was
killed in. battle in Cuba, /

MUST PAY LOSS
ON MORGAN CITY
Frankfort Marine Com
pany Loses Suit in
the Circuit Court.
Jury Exonerates Captain
John Barneson,; Agent
for the Owners.
It required but one ballot and no de
liberation at all for the jury in the case
of the La Due Gold Mining and Develop
ment Company vs. the Frankfort Marine
Insurance Company to bring in a verdict
yesterday in the United States Circuit
Court for the plaintiff for the full ' sum
asked, . $18,888 89, being on the
charter party of the Morgan City,
wrecked on the coast of Japan. The jury
also awarded interest on the sum named
at 7 per cent from July 6, 1900, to the date
of the verdict. . ""*â > v
The insurance company refused to hon
or Its policy on the Morgan City's char
ter party on the' contention that the char
ter party was' void because' Captain John
Barneson of the firm of Barneson & Chll
cott, agents for the owners, was also an
officer of the Government, namely, ma
rine superintendent of army transports at
this port, the Revised Statutes making it
unlawful for an officer of the United
States to be interested in contracts with
the Government. The charter party, it
was contended, was therefore void and
the defendant could not be bound by it.
Early in the case United States " Circuit
Judge \ Morrow decided that Captain
Barneson, having been appointed to his
office by an official other than the head of
a department, was not an officer of the
United States under the act, and counsel
argued therefrom that anything he might
do in " the matter could not vitiate the
charter party.
Then an attempt was made by. the de
fense to show that the Morgan City was
lost through unskillful navigation on the
part of her officers, but that branch of
the case did not occupy much time. - - '
Peter Dunne was leading counsel for
the plaintiff. In his address to the jury
he contended that the defendant had ac
cepted the premium "on the insurance on
the charter party of the vessel; that the
vessel was -wrecked by. accident, owing to
usual perils of the sea, and that the only
proper course for the defendant â¢ would
have been to pay the loss without re
course to the courts. E. S. Plllsbury,
leading â¢ counsel for the defendant, re
ferred to the letter introduced in evidence,
which showed that certain parties in New
York were to be "placated" with money
for their assistance in high places in ob
taining, the charter party for the La Due
Company, owner of the Morgan City.
Deputy United States Marshal George
Burnham turned the key in the lock of
the jury-room at 3:30 o'clock in the after
noon, and before he reached the Marshal's
office down stairs the bell rang and the
jury announced that they had agreed
upon a verdict. They were brought into
the courtroom, where Judge Morrow and
the counsel were awaiting them. Their
verdict was recorded, and Judge Morrow
thanked them for the attention they had
paid to their duty.

DUNPHY PLEADS
SELF-DEFENSE
Tells Jury, the Causes
Leading to Killing
of Stan ton.
The circumstances that led up to the
killing of . Edward Stanton September 27
at the corner of Minna and Mary streets
were told by James M. Dunphy yesterday
to a- Jury in Judge Cook's court. The
prisoner made nis statement in a
straightforward manner. He testified
that when ! he learned from, his
mother that his sister Kate had been de
ceived he was almost crazy and could
neither sleep nor eat. As Stanton waa
not 21 years of age at the time of his
marriage on August 25 to Miss Bryant,
the defendant thought the marriage could
be annulled. He came to the city to see
Stanton and ask him. to right the wrong
done his sister. Stanton had been brag
ging about his deception at the Mare Isl
and Navy Yard,, where he was employed,
and all Vallejo was talking about it.
Dunphy then told of nis search for
Stanton and declared that when he met
him Friday evening, September 20, Stan
ton and his brother, Maurice Durbin, and
four or live friends were all armed. As
he had been warned by his mother and
friends in Vallejo that Stanton -was al
ways armed, he bought two revolvers
after the Friday night incident to be pre
pared for trouble. When next they met
Stanton refused to speak to him about
his sister and told him to write him if
ho had anything to say. On the evening
of the shooting Dunphy had Just left a
corner grocery and was lighting a cigar
ette, when Stanton suddenly appeared
and said: "You have been following me
and it must stop. If you don't I'll blow
the roof of your head off." Stanton made
a motion with his left hand for his hip
pocket and then Dunphy shot him
Dunphy said he did not know how many
shots he fired, as he was excited at the
time. : . . â  -
Mrs. Catherine Dunphy, mother of the
defendant, testified- that she visited Stan
ton in this city and asked him to marry
her daughter, but he refused. When she
asked if it were true that he was al
ready married he told her it was none of
her business. Stanton, she testified, had
been very attentive to her daughter and
had almost lived at their house. When
she was forced to tell the defendant that
Stanton had deceived Â»his sister he was
almost crazy and could not sleep nor eat
She warned him to be careful, as Stan
ton always went armed.
Lloyd W. Bryant, whose sister Stanton
married ; Joseph F. Cavanaugh and Wil
liam Collins, all residents of Vallejo, were
called to testify as to Stanton's habit of
carrying a revolver. When Collins was
being- cross-examined by Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Alford he was asked if he
had ever been convicted : of a felony, and
replied; "I don't remember." To other
questions of a similar import he returned
the same answer. Alford claims that
Collins was sentenced. to three years' Im
prisonment in San Quentin for abducting
two young girls. Judge Cook ordered Col
lins to remain In attendance on the court
and directed him to-be present next Tues
day, to which time the trial was con
tinued. , '' â¢- .. ; /

RABBIS' THEMES
ARE MOMENTOUS
Rev. Nieto Speaks of
"Our Forefathers and
Ourselves."
There waa a large attendance at the
synagogues last night, Rev. Dr. Nieto
at the Congregation Sherith Israel taking
for the theme of his sermon "Our Fore
fathers and Ourselves," \ while Rev. Dr.
Voorsanger at the Temple Emanu-El de
livered an impassioned sermon an the sub
ject of "Free Thought." The Rev. Dr.
Nieto In making a comparison in the
treatment of his theme said that the
prime Idea was that it could be proved
that the moral sentiment which actuated
our forefathers to religious thought and
action was prompted rather by fear than
by piety. â¢ .
Justice with them was not a duty which It
was Imperative for the strong, the good and
the true to perform, bat rather the unanswered
cry of the weak. It was not the piteous spec
tacle of the defenseless widow and her orphans
at the mercy of the, world, going about from
place to place and begging mercy, that moved
them, but rather the thought expressed, "LeÂ«t
your wives become widows and your children
orphans." If to-day Tire could only appeal to
the selfish motives of people, to their fears for
their own welfare, if we could only obtain as
sistance for the needy, the destitute and the
sick through an expressed dread, we would
scarcely call ourselves moral or pious or deem,
ourselves possessed of virtuous sentiment.
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger during his dis
course on "Free Thought" declared that
people could not epeak freely and act
freely, but must obey the laws of God
and man.
Speech must be conditioned by sentiments of
propriety and law.' One could photograph an
infidel with the sneer upon his face question
ing revelation, law and righteousness. The
free thinkers of years ago interpreted tradi
tions of religion and faith In a free and easy
manner and there was something uncanny
about them, but to-day times are changed, and
from ten thousand pulpits in the United States
there are opinions of a far more radical tend
ency than those expressed a generation agoi
