Thomas Filben of .the general committee
when, at 2:30. o'clock, he arose and form

ranged directly beneath the grand chorus

vocalists were massed in the rea,r be

siderably above, the level of the gallery
floor. The sounding board bore In letters

Our Chief Aim Missionsâ 1901." The
ladles comprising the chorus appeared for
the greater part in white gowns, and with
their . handkerchiefs, which were freely
used in greeting the State and city exec
utives, as well as the chairmen of the
general and music committees, presented
a charming sight.

T. B. Hutcbinson of Napa proved an
exceptionally bright and entertaining
speaker and was heartily applauded
throughout his discourse. In which he
said: * -. #
To-night we meet here under the auspices of

OPENING SESSION OF CONVENTION
Man}' a church to-day would hardly have the
name to live were it not for the presence and
jx)wÂ»r of those belonging to It who- are under
U years of age, and I further boldly aver that
no MÂ«?*-hodist church can be found to-day
which cannot honestly, attribute much of its
life and power to Its Epworth Ueague. Pews
long vacant are now filled with >nsplrlnt
vouth. and every pastor finds his loyal legion
to be composed almost wholly of those who
wear the Epworth badge. If the future church
Is to have proper leadership, the young mem
bers should be carefully trained for such re
sponsibilities. We have discovered that our
denominational Bociety has proved Itself K^ed
lor such training. All departments of churtn
life ha\'e felt the quickening powers of this
er*Â«.t movement.
The wonderful nineteenth century will be re
membered on history's page for many things,
but lor none more than for this: The young
Christians cf North America, banded together
for Christian sen-ice, came to know no section.
Hast or West, North cr South, not - even a ,
national boundary line between the tnited
States and Canada, They recognized two nags,
It la true but they both stood for the same
noble principles. The language, the liberty,
the Institutions, the civilization were the same
under each. Every Britisher was at home un
der the Stars and Stripes and every American
came to feel- safe and secure under the Union
Jack, whether he was In Toronto, London, Cal
cutta Hongkong or Cape Town. This glorious
brotherhood has Jieen enhanced by the young
people's movement of the nineteenth century.
Preparation and Achievement.
The Rev. G. W. Kerby, A. B., of Mon
treal spoke on the "Young People s Move
ment in the Twentieth Century." He was
continually applauded during his remarks.
He said:
The Hible 1Â« "the living link" bindlng'the
centuries together. Ihe Bible and young peo
ple's movement were the two great determin
ing factors of the twentieth century. The
nineteenth cÂ«ntury was the period of prepara
tion. The twentieth will be the period of
achievement. We are setting up our banners
to-day for the twentieth century. The Bret
banner bears the Inscription: "My Life lor
Chrlet." or the soldier's sense of consecra
tion. This is the starting point of the twen
tieth century army â a new sense of consecra
tion needed. The eolfiler for Chrtrt must live
the separated, detached, self-abandoned ' t lite.
Th; second banner: "My Fellow for Christ,"
cr the rente of personal servlc* and responsi
bility. PlaLs. resolutions, committees are good,
but they cannot regenerate .society or save
rc^n. It was not a commute? that kindled the
revival of the eighteenth century- It was John
Wesley. The third banner: "My City for
Christ," suggesting the claims and obligations
of citizenship. The city was -the strategic
point. The best way to raise the standard of
citizenship was by the power of -example. If
yoa would clean tne 6heet and close the saloon,
you must vote that way. The presentlve min
leterles must also be emphasized.
We muet save our br-ys and young men. drive
party politics out of city governments and
form a federation of all .churches against cr
ranlzed Â«vil. The fourth banner: "My Coun
try for Christ." or the Christian sense "of pa
triotism. "America for Christ" and "Canada
f5r Chrift" are the patriotic banners we lift
up to-day. We have had enough of the Jingo
rpirlt. We need more of the Christ spirit. The
fifth banner: "The World for Christ." sug
gesting the Ideas of humanity, brotherhood
End world-wide evangelization. The Christian
who only tries to win a little bit of the world
for Christ will be a little bit of a Christian. In
twenty-five years the Epworth League on the
continent ought to be winning 500.000 souls and
raiting- $1,000,000 a year for missions. Then a
generation ehall not pass away until the gospel
cf the Kingdom is preached to every creature.

During the song service the Rev. G. W.

core, but Mr. Watt announced that It

devotions, after which the ReV. H. M.

necessary announcements.

preparation which has been mniHnu all thing*

part the work of Presbyterian, Congregational.
Baotlst and other Christian minds and hearts
and hands. Thousands of Christian Endeav
orers Join as heartily in tie rejoicing of this
hour as If they were all Methodists. WÂ« havÂ«
been getting ready sines long before the con
vention in Indianapolis. But yoa will flnrt
that all the paraphernalia of our preparation
forms thÂ« very least part of the welcome wa
have Intended to give yoa.
"Welcome Is a Sacred Thing.
That Bomethlnjr which we call "Welcome" Is
a very sacred thins. .And yet the word Is not
to be found in the Bible. It Is a thing of the
heart and very Uttle at It ever gets Into speech.
There ta no more necessity for proving the ex
istence of light than that of hospitality. WÂ«
have hoped that you would find something more
.In our welcome than a room, some straw and
water. And many Â» way-worn traveler on these
bleak and rugged hills has found colossal com
fort in some poor roan's cabin with no more
material provision for his welfare. "Hospi
tality must be tor service, not for show, or
It pulls down the host." We are your servants
who love hospitality and will use It without
grudging for your sake. If we are good serv
ants you will know it and we will know It.
"The worst part of a bad servant la hla
tongue." If many thing* with which you hav*>
been familiar tn your Eastern homes cannot
be found amid thÂ« simplicity or rusticity of
our horaea, you will find ample magnificence in
the wide open fields, majestic forest*. Inspir
ing canyons and transporting mountain rang-a
of California. Tou have welcome there to helo
yourselves from our splendid abundance. Shel
ley rave a good definition of hospitality in tha
hymn to Mercury when he wrote:
Tou must come home with me and be my guest.
Tou will gtve Joy to me, and I will do
All that is tn my power to honor you.
The definition given In the street by one of
the newsboys to one of the first-comerm to this
convention, however, was tntended doubtless to
express Just as much ninceritv and warmth.
He said, "You will find a Western welcome
Is a yard wide and all wool": that Is honest
and warm. Tou will find It U chivalrous to
chivalry. There is a solrtt of knighthood in
the herolo oourteay of Western manners. But
In your welcome, as "tn the legends of Parsi

elements are welded together." The only chiv
alry worth having is that which is the read
iest to pay deference to righteousness and
truth, and therefore the good of all ages.
"When a man becomes a Christian." said
Drumraond, "the living Christ enters into his

Dr. Joseph IV Berry: My
heartiest congratulations on
GOOlf WISHES
FOR SUCCESS â
OF .GATHERING
GROWTH OF METHODISH
IN NINETEENH CENTURY
1. Methodism must put noble Ideals before her
leaguers. She must rouse their socialjconsclcncs
and thrust them oat into the thick of the fight
for the enthronement of righteousness. Let it
once be told in the lower regions that Chris
tians have left our cities to be managed by
uneodly men and hell would hold high carnival
and Satan proclaim a holiday for festivities.
She must constrain them to independent service
for God. Comroltteeism is rampant and we are
in danger of having Christ say to us: "I was
sick and your committee visited me."
3, She must teach the stewardship of money.
A colossal question before this century la to get
Christ's lordship acknowledged in material
things. The trouble wltn me church is pa
ganized money. <
3. She must set a high standard of Christian
living before the world. Other churches are
-waking on the question of holiness and we must
beware lest thoy take our crown. The glorious
light of sanctlflcation must flame forth from
our sanctuaries to win the world.
4. She mast keep in touch with the toners.
This Is one of the biggest questions on the top
of the earth. Methodism must grasp tha
bronzed hand of tha toller Just as heartily and
tenderly as the gloved and jeweled hand of the
rich. She should have an employment bureau
in every church: she should advocate profit
sharing and compulsory arbitration and evary
movement for their good. She must do her ut
most to put the hand of capital into the hand
of labor and say: "Those whom God hath
joined together let no man put asunder."
- 5. She must preach to save. Our greatest
need la not a million dollars, but a million
souls for God before -we have marched a de
cade Into this century. The people are not
clamoring for infldel notions and destructive
criticism, but an intelligent discussion of tha
old' gospel of salvation, Nothing will draw
like it. The pastor that does not preach to save
will not keep step in the century, and the
church that does not organize and conduct suc
cessful revivals ought to fall out of line and
join some other organization. labeled:
**A cool retreat for retired Christians.**
Devotions were conducted at the close
of and during the meeting by Rev. P. A.
Cool, D. D.. of Spokane. Wash., and thÂ«
song service "was under the direction of
"W. C Stadtfeld, musical director.
THE meeting at the Alhambra
Theater was largely attended and.
the audience was roused to a
high pitch of enthusiasm by sev
eral eloquent speakers. The the
ater was handsomely decorated
with- -the Epworth- colors-and &
profusion of choice cut flowera lined the
front of the stage. -
The meeting was presided over by Rev.
M. A. Crews, secretary of the Epworth
League of Canada, who opened the pro
ceedings with a few brief but felicitous
remarks.
The Rev. a. Monk of Knoxville, Tenn..
was introduced a3 the first speaker of the
evening, his suject being "The Young
People's Movement of the Nineteenth
Century." Dr. Monk traced the growth
and development of the young people's
efforts in the line of religious work, which
he said had accomplished much for Chris
tianity. He exhorted his young headers
to help in the battle agratnst vice and to
do all In their power to aid in the conver
sion of the people of less favored lands.
Young People's Movement.
Rev. Matt S. Hughes of Kansas City.
Mo., delivered an interesting address on
"The- Young- People's Movement of the
Twentieth Century." He outlined what
would be expected of the future leaguer
and predicted that the success of the
movement In the last century would be
surpassed by the results achieved in the
present century. The gTeater success, Dr.
Hughes said, would come because the
young people of the coming cycle .would
be fortified with the knowledge and ex
perience gained by their predecessors.
Continuing he said:
The future leaguer will be a higher type than
the leagruer of to-day. The heir of tho nine
teenth century, he has exceptional opportunity.
He begins, not as a pioneer, as did his father,
but as a capitalist. He has the advantage of
popular favor of established institutions of com
plete equipment and organization for Christian
work: the advantage of co-operate denomina
tionalism. The leaguer la no longer an experi
ment, but has a definite place in the programme
of the twentieth century.
Twentieth. Century Methodism.
Probably the best address of the even
ing was delivered by the Rev. E. E. Scott,
Vancouver, B. C, who in an eloquent and
forceful manner spoke on "The Method
ism of the Twentieth Century." Dr. Scott
told some plain truths In vigorous style,
and his remarks were punctuated with
frequent applause. His address was Inter
spersed with witty anecdotes, each of
which was In Itself a sermon and pointed
a moral. Dr. Scott said In part:
"The Methodism of the Twentieth Century?"
Such a theme is enough to kindle the specula
tive fancy of a seer ana to call forth a pro
phetic message worthy of a Hebrew sage. When
Methodism speaks to twice the population of
Judea In the zenith of her glory under David
and Solomon, surely the turning of the hinges
of this new century requirrs aome . new Isaiah
to do Justice to the vision. Seeing I am but a
child and no prophet, let me outline some of
the things upon which we must put the empha
sis to justify our claim to stand in the van of

the Epworth League, presided at the
meeting. The first speaker of the even
ing, the Rev. Dr. C. "W. Millard, presiding
elder of Ycmkers. N. Y., took for his sub
ject "The Young People's Movement in
the Nineteenth Century." He claimed
that the nineteenth century.- with its tre
mendous possibilities, has been essentially
a century for the young people. Through
his address he advanced argument to
Â£how that a society or an organization
without the influence and foundation of
spirituality is doomed to failure. In
speaking along this - line he said: "Be
hind social forces is the great influence of
religion and behind religion is the great
sustaining power of spirituality. Spirit
uality, while distinct from emotionalism,
elevates and purifies it. The greatest man
is he wnose virtues are grounded in spir

You will find San Francisco to be a cosmopoli
tan city, composed of people from all States
and countries, and its broad and generous spirit
gives welcome to all. Our commonwealth was
founded by the pioneer, whose rugged sense of
right and whose love of Justice, although at
times it was rudely administered, has made
him a distinct character In history. He was en
terprising, fearless, tolerant and Just. He laid
the foundation of an American State, true to
American Ideals, and excluded slavery from its
constitution. He established schools, universi
ties and churches. And to show conclusively
that this generation sympathizes with the
cause of morality and education, and regards
such Institutions as instrumentalities for the
promotion of both. It may be said that at the
last election universities ana cnurches were by
popular vote exempted from taxation. Whereas
In the beginning. of San Francisco the turbu
lence of a mining camp was part of its dally
life, yet out of the confusion of those times
Mayor Phelan was next introduced. He
was received with enthusiasm. He said
he was glad to extend a welcome to the
delegates In behalf "of the people of San
Francisco, and then alluded to the early
pioneers who came in armies from the
East In the days of '49 and made their
homes here because they were attracted
by the goddess, California. Resuming, he
said:

paramount policy of this country that no al

be free from the dominance of sectarian creed,

TO-DAY'S CONVENTION PROGRAMME
The Rev. Dr. C. F. Reid of Iowa, a mis
sionary who is now on his way to preach
the gospel in the countries of the Orient,
contributed the" closing remarks of the
evening. He selected for his subject
"Methodism of the Twentieth Century."
He enunciated the principles and alma of
the Methodist church and told how It^
field of activity might be greatly -widened.
His remarks were Interrupted with fre
quent applause>
There Is one national funeral that ought to
be celebrated, and that Is the funeral of
bigotry. There would be no mourners and no
eulogy. It should not be burled In the land
but in the sea, ten thousand fathoms deep.
There should be one day set apart in each
year on which the whole human family could
unite In partaking of the Lord's Supper. A day
on which there would be no Catholics and no
Protestants. You may talk about poetry, but
â¢what idea or thought could be more beautiful
and inspiring than that of the whole human
race uniting In one brotherhood for the Â¦worship
of their God?
"Young People'siMovement in the Twen
tieth Century" was the title of a very en
tertaining address which waa made by
the Rev.- Dr. John Coleman of Glens Falls.
N. T. In the course of his remarks he
said:
izations are , those which are backed by
that imperious power." Â¦ '. Â¦ . -
The speaker devoted his closing' remarks
to the Epworth League, arguing that It Is
exemplary Of denominationalism among
the young people, and that its members
should be encouraged to cherish the mag
nificent inheritance of Methodism.

and social distinction of the other. If the lines
still further cross the Atlantic Ocean and go
on to the Bast, the State Is seen to lie in the
latitudes corresponding: to Spain. Italy, the
Mediterranean coasts and the Holy Land. With
the Japanese stream and Alaskan current along
our coast, the trade winds In from the south
west, and the mountains to hold back tha
storms from the Fast, we have the climate of
both the temperate and torrid zones. But what
shall It profit us if we gain. the whole world
and are profligate with our privileges? The
throne of- righteousness is the throne of em
pire. Righteousness tendeth to life. Right
eousness exalteth a nation. California needs
nothing so much to-day as the controlling In
fluence of more righteous men and women.
Now that you are all here, you can do nothing
better for us than to stay. What a crusade it
would be for 30,000 Christian young men and
Â¦women to build their altars over- against our
worship of Mammon and the god of this world, j
If. you will think of It and stay, we will make
Â¦your welcome life-long. Itjis more to be de
sired than gold. . Yea. than much fine gold..

ination. Any members from other
churches are cordially invited to partici
pate with us in this service."
The Rev. G. W. Kerby and the Rev. G.
1 R. Turk of Canada rendered "I Shall
Know Him" as a duet with much feeling
after which Dr. Beard made the confes
sion, and the communion was adminis
tered by the Revs. Good sell, Beard and
Shore. - Â¦ * -
At the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church Dr. John J. Tigert of Nashville.
Tenn., presided. The entrance to the
church was tastefully decorated in paper
and two large American flags. Streamers
were suspended from the choir loft, and
on the organ pipes hung an Epworth
League badge in colors. The Rev. W. P.
Thirkield, Rev. T. A. Monk, Rev. J.
Young and Rev. Van Anda assisted In the
service, which was simlar to the one at
the Howard-street church. Dr. Tlgert
making- a few earnest remarks on the pur
pose of the gathering:.
Simple yet impressive were the services
held at the First Congregational Church-
There was no sermon or extended musical
programme, but only the presentation of
the solemn ritual service of the Methodist
Episcopal church. Bishop Isaac "W. Joyce,
president of the Epworth League, of
ficiated, and numbers of delegates attend
ed the service in the hope of hearing him
preach, but in this they were disappointed.
In opening the services Bishop Joyce of
fered a fervent prayer for the success of
the great convention and that the delib
erations might be guided by the divins
spirit. In conclusion he invited all the-
Epworth Leaguers, all the Methodists and
all thejjecple of other denominations who
were present to partake of the sacrament
of communion. Almost* 1000 advanced in
turn to the chancel rail and kneeling de
voutly, in accordance with the custom of
the Methodist church, received the sacra
ment of the last supper.
In the services and in administering the
sacrament Bishop Joyce was directly as
sisted by the following clergymen: Rev.
Dr. W. S. Matthew, presiding elder at
Sacramento: Rev. Dr. S. G. Dale, presid
ing elder of the Napa district; RÂ«v Dr.

The old-fashioned homestead
Where I dreamed my dream of dreams.
Well, you are In California, Have you all
ifcandoned your Imaginations yet? Have you
vividly realized all you expected before you
i :ame! I trow not. The country is far from
finished, but it Is no longer a mere strip of
orean-dunes and sandbanks with an uninvit
ing background of barren rocks and inacces
sible mountains at which the Spaniards flung
are the latest mÂ«*s6engers from the old homes.
Are we not glad to see you? Did not the
bowels of Joseph yearn upon his brother? He
sought where to weep. He commanded the
steward of his house, eaying: "Fill the men's
eacks with food; as much as they can carry."
We all wish we could put every one's money
in his sack's mouth. I see yonder the men
and woiaen of Massachusetts. Many of you
have come from Boston, as Emerson eaid,
"That darling town of ours": some oÂ£ you
have come from "the old Granite State"
where "the hills"â but not the mountainsâ are
"so lofty, magnificent and great." I Â«ee some
of the Van Twillers from the Knickerbocker
State; "the Pennpylvany Dutch"; eome of you
are from "the Eastern Sho' "; a few of the
*'F. F. V.'s" are here from "Ole Vlrginy";
, and you might as well admit It. there is "a
lot of Georrfa Crackers." I know there arc
pome here from "Tenn-e-see." How many are
Wolverines. Badgers, Buckeyes. Hoosiers, Suck
ers and all the rest 1 do not know? You are
all come from the
Home that our feet may leave, but not our
hearts.
What a meeting of the dans -there will be!
There win be many an hour for reminiscence
which is not put down on the ! programme.
There will be n-.any Inquiries by thexld'Call
fornlans for some word from â
hyterlan. . There were 18.934 Presbyterian com
municants; 36,874 Methodist. The total poula
tlon of 'the, Roman Catholics was 157.346, or
abouf one-eighth of the population of the State.
The population of the Methodists was 129,059.
These figures will be 1 greatly modified when
the census which was recently taken Is re
ported. . â¢ ; ' 'Â¦ .
In the Eyes of the "World. *
California is neither at the world's end.
where it costs a fortune to go. nor hidden from
the world's view, so that nothing can be seen
of what it may. say -or, do. It Is more in the
eye of. all the people to-day than any other
political State east or ' west, north or south,,
the earth ; over. .... - .-. ; Â¦
"Westward' the course of empire takes Its
,way." The. first great drama was acted upon
the waters of .the Mediterranean; for 400 years
the play has been .upon the Atlantic Ocean:
time "shall close the drama with the day" on
the Pacific- California has the vantage ground
of the . world.' The : lines of our latitude when
stretched across the continent include the At
lantic coast from Boston to Charleston. We
may. hope some day to have the character and
culture of the one with the pride of ancestry
THE preliminary, communion serv
ices of the Kpworth League were
he4d in the Howard-street and
Central M. E. churches and the
First Congregational Church yes
terday morning 1 . They were very
lightly attended, not more than
six cr seven hundred participating In the
three combined. Being strictly of a re
ligious nature, the public apparently took
little interest in them.
The Howard-street Church was taste
fully decorated with red, yellow and white
paper festooned around the galleries, ceil
ing and organ loft, with Epworth League
flags on the stations. The congregation
began gathering early and fifteen minutes
before the hour set for the service began
singing familiar songs. . Rev. J. A. B. "Wil

OPENING SESSION OF CONVENTION
THE presiding elders and all the
other members of the Epworth
League who are interested in
missionary work held a special
conference yesterday afternoon in
the art gallery of the Pavilion.
Although the meeting was essen
tially preliminary, considerable was ac
complished and plans were laid fcr arous
ing the delegates io more enthusiastic
support of the foreign and domestic mis
eIo.is.
W. W. Cooper called the conference to
order and said that mission work was the
primary aim of the Epworth League. Rev.
Dr. H. M. Du Bose, general secretary of
the Epworth League of the M. E. Church
Bouth. and Rev. Dr. Joseph F. Berry,
general secretary of the Epworth League,
delivered short addresses in which they
explained the necessity for increased ef
forts in the missionary field. Dr. Berry
presented an official statement from the
cabinet of officer.* to the effect that the
coming year has been specially conse
crated to missionary work. In this en
deavor, during that period, it is the inten
tion of the league to utilize all available
energy.

two bullseyes for his last two shots. Then
pandemonium broke loose and stayed at
large for the day. . .
BUT THREE BULLETS
MISS TARGET'S "BLACK."
Of Strecker's 200 shots, 146 were within
three inches of the center, or "needle
point," of the target. Of this 146, sixty
one were within one and a half inches of
"r-eedle point"; fifty-one more bullets
struck within six inches "of the center.
The three shots that went wild, so far as
results were concerned, struck -within half
an inch of the "black," or within six and a
half Inches of the center.
"I am glad," Strecker said afterward,
"that I was able to do so much to. dem
onstrate the prowess of California marks
men. If it be my fortune to win the hon
ored title of shooting king I would not
surrender it- for a present of the finest
he me on Asbury Heights. I am a poor
man, but money would not tempt me to
part with the honor." ..â¢- ...
"Strecker is king," F. C. Ross, king of
the first National Schuetzenfest .and a
royal good fellow, said. "No one expects
his wonderful score to be beaten. It was
a great exhibition, and none of the East
ern cracks hope now to win the crown.
American marksmen lead the world," and
Callfornians lead America. The conditions
are right for it here. Your atmosphere
is superb for shooting. Opportunities for
practice here are most favorable also.
You have an open Sunday, and men of
moderate means are able to go to the
ranges on that day. In consequence you
have ten active marksmen to our one,
though our Schuetzen clubs have a much
larger membership. Again, we have to
shoot through "port holes" located thirty
feet from the targets. These port holes
are about six inches wide by twenty
inches high. The object of this arrange
ment is to prevent stray bullets doing
damage in adjacent houses. Here your
shooting ranges are remote and the tar
get is open, affording better practice. But,
however attained, results count, and
Strecker has done a wonderful. thing."
MOST WONDERFUL FEAT
OF ALL COMPETITIONS

the festival. In 1897 Strecker won first
prize at the man target, scoring 97 out of

Yesterday was International day. Hon.

KING HAYES SHOOTS ... Â¦ .
BUT MAKES SMALL SCORE
King Hayes shot a number of rounds at
the various targets yesterday, but failed
to make a score in keeping with his rec
ord. He has not been able to round into
form . during . this festival, and in no in
stance did he make a score that would
entitle him to a place among the top
notchers against whom he was pitted.
His best score yesterday was 19. 25, 18, on
the honorary target. He was beaten by
four points by President Kuhls of the

markable shooting of any tournament. It
was wonderful, superb, and the rifle with
five little holes in the end of the barrel
showed itself to be about right."
"That record will stand for years," Cap

that no other marksmen would score

Strecker.
Adolph Strecker first came into,promi

The War Office issued late to-night a
dispatch from Lord Kitchener giving the
correspondence between Mr. Reitz and
Mr. Steyn that was captured with the
latter's baggage near Lindley, July 1L
Mr. Reitz, under date of May 10, wrote
Mr. Steyn that a meeting of the Trans
vaal Government had been held, attended
by General Botha, General Viljoen and
Mr. Smutz, to consider the national situa
tion. He went on to catalogue the diffi
cultiesâthe numerous surrenders of bur
ghers entailing a heavy responsibility on
the Government, the rapidly decreasing
supply of ammunition, the disintegration
of the Government and the lack of any
definite assurances of European interven
tion. . Â¦ - * â¢
"In view of these facts," he said, "the
Government has decided to address : a
message to President Kruger, pointing
out the terrible conditions. The time has
passed for us to let matters remain as at
present We must take a final step."
Mr. Steyn, replying May 20, upbraids
Mr. Reltz with weak-heartedness, saying:
"Thera is still sufficient ammunition to
continue the struggle. You ask what
road, will sever his connection, with the
road, with which he has been connected
so long, and. that he : will ..soon assume
active direction of the affairs of the Min
neapolis and St. Louis and the Iowa Cen
tral. Both these roads have, now their
main offices located in the same suite of
rooms in. the. Broad Exchange building,
and an adjoining office is now being fitted
up for Mr. Hawley and one for H. E.
Huntinston. â¢
It was said to-day that Mr. Hawley's
resignation was to be tendered at the
meeting of the Southern Pacific directors
held to-day, but Chairman Tweed said
that this report was incorrect.' At the
office of the Iowa Central it was said that
Mr. Hawley's friends believed he -would
soon sever his connection with the South
ern Pacific to devote his entire time to
the duties of president of the Minneapolis
and St. Louis, a position. he has held for
several years. . ..-,Â¦â¢-

God?
"I have seen recent European newspa
pers and I firmly believe that complica
tions will occur in Europe in the course
of a few months which . will secure our
good fortune."
Mr. Steyn also says the fact that Mr.
Kruger and the Boer delegates remain in
Europe convinces him that they consider
the case not beyond â¢ hope. . He adds that
he has summoned â¢ General Dewet -andi

Officers.
ON the fifth day of the Schuetzen
fest a new claimant of regal
honors gave signal proof of 'his
prowess at the ranee, and there
are none who have the hardi
hood to deny him the crown.
Adolph Strecker. a Callfornian. a San
Franciscan, has broken all records at the
king target and he will be "Schuetzen
Koenig" of the Third National Bundes
fest, unless by miraculous marksmanship
some other contestant snatches the honor
from him.
It Is not at every shooting festival that a
world's record is broken. Never before
has a Californian proved himself to be
the premier marksman of the world, and
Callfornians were not slow to recognize
the worth of the man whose steadiness of
.nerve and muscle and keenness of eye
eclipsed the greatest feats of the sharp
shooters of all ages. The Eastern crack
shots bend the knee to him and join in
the acclaim which greets the new shoot
ing- king wherever he appears. For while
Strecker is still uncrowned there is
scarcely a chance that any one will sur
pass his record and take the honors of
the tournament from him.
Strecker completed his 200 shots at the
king target at 9:30 a. m. yesterday. His
total of points scored was 394â so far be
yond previous achievements that all
marksmen characterize his shooting as
marvelous. European records are left far
behind and so high a mark is set by the
California rifleman that experts sav it
will not be excelled within fifty years.
William Hayes of Newark won the title
of shooting king fn 1898 by a total of 373
points, or twenty-one fewer than Strecker
made fn the achievement which he com
pleted yesterday. And Hayes' shooting
was hailed as the greatest the world had
seen. Three years prior to that, in the
first national Schuetzenfest, F. C. Ross

SILVER ' CUPS , PRESENTED
TO, POPULAR MARKSMEN
One of the prettiest features of the day
was the presentation of a festival cup to
Edward Goetze by -President Kuhls. -The
presentation was made in the-presence of
a number of friends of the popular-lieu
tenant. A' neat little speech, was made by
President Kuhls. as he handed the silver
token to the marksman who had won it
by scoring more than 300 points. ' It was
filled immediately with foaming, sparkling
wine and passed to the friends of -the win
ner of the cup. It-was filled and emptied
several times before it was given back to
the marksman whose skill .had enabled
him to thus add a pretty touch of senti
ment to the schuetzen festival.
Fred Bushnell also won a cup yesterday
at the butts. He scored more than 300
points on the standard target and was
presented with one of the handsome silver
goblets. %
Al Lehrke, who has been one of the
steady shooters since the opening of the
fest, made the last bullseye of the day.
While he has not made a brilliant score,
his shooting has given him rank among
those who are called "cracks."
The best . shot on the bear target yes
teurday was made by C. Leighton of Los
Angeles. He scored 12 out of a possible
18 points.
BELKNAP AND RODGERS
TIE ON PTJBLIC r TARGET
F. W. Belknap of Los Angeles shot 74
on .the public point target yesterday, and
for a time was looked upon as one of the
big winners of the festival. His score of
24â25â25 out of a possible 75 was an ex
ceptionally good one. and few of the
marksmen figured that it would be
equaled, s Congratulations were" showered
upon him," and he opened several bottles
of Rhine wine on the strength of his
shooting. It was while helping several
friends to" dispose of a few quarts of the
German exhilarator that he received word
that his score had been tied ' by Dr. L.
O. Rodgers of the Golden Gate Rifle and
Pistol Club. Dr. Rodgers and Belk
nap were close friends, and the news that
.he , had been removed from the sharp
shooters' by Dr. Rodgers gave
him. no displeasure. He relinquished hia
seat of honor" to Dr.' Rodgers in a~courtly
manner, and wished ' the genial medico
all success in the trial for supremacy

tlons, with less In honor and prizes at
stake and less of excitement to unnerve
the contestant, has Strecker's feat ever
been approached.
It was a great day at Shell Mound Park,
and It will live always In the memory of
the marksmen who were so fortunate as
to be present. Â¦ More than the usual num
ber of sharpshooters wore present, and as
Strecker drew nearer to the two hun
dredth shot every one of them grave over
individual efforts and watched breath
lessly as the peerless marksman scored
centers and bullseyes one after the other.
And when the last shot had been fired
and the full Import of it all dawned upon
Strecker'* local admirers and the visitors
from the Bast, the ranges rang with
cheers and the crowd gave way to. wild
enthusiasm such as had never before been
seen at a Schuetzenfest in the New World.
For the remainder of the day there was
but -one toast, "Zum neuen Schuetzen
Koenig,"-and that was drank numberless
times in the rarest of . Rhine wines and
the dryest of champagnes. The re
mainder of the day was a celebration â
for all but the marksmen who kept dog
gedly to their work. With hope low â¢ in
their breasts, but with prim determination
they did their best, though the crown of
the shooting king seemed no longer among
things attainable.
Strecker began shooting at half past 8
o'clock. He had already flred 160 shots of
his 200, and was only six points below the
"bullseye average," as marksmen put it.
He had slept but three hours, so great
was the nervous strain upon him, and he
began the day with the fear that his
nerve would fail him. But he warmed up
to the work and soon he was oblivious of
all surroundings . and as calm and steady
of nerve as if it were only practice shoot
ing. He shot steadily and rapidly, and
within less than an hour he started upon
his last ten shots. He scored seven bulls
eyes in succession, and then something
happened. - .
"The strain became unbearable," said
.Strecker afterwards, "and from pure nerv
ousness I saw the bead of my rifle double.
I knew I ought to wait, but I had to make
an end of the agony. So I picked one of
the beads and fired. A missâ I had picked
the phantom bead, and the bullet went
wide of the black."
1 But the error served to steady the
HAIL!. HAIL! The king has come." This was heard on
every side yesterday at Shell Mound as Adolph Strtck
er passed in and out of the shooting boxes. Not yet
.vested with authority nor king b>' right he is the man of the
hour on the Shell Mound ranges. His scores shattered into
bits everything that has ever been done on the point target
here or anywhere. Of course there is a possibility that some
greater shooter may be developed before the Third National
Bundes Festival is a thing of the past, but there are no men in
Shell Mound these days with a liking for the short end of three
to one bets that he will not be produced. Strecker's score of
394 points stands by itself and will make him famous through
out the land and in the country across the water where native
Germans shoot as if it were their religion. King Hayes is not
yet dead, but his shooting life blood is oozing out of his veins
every minute. His body is not yet cold, but the populace is
shouting "King Hayes is dead! Long live King Strecker."
"THE KING IS DEAD
LONG LIVE THE KING"
THE contest for final honors on the ranges is narrowing
down. It' is no longer the East against the West, for the
West is capturing prize after prize in unremitting fashion.
Withvthe kingship practically settled and imposed, the inter
est "Â¦'. has switched from tHat point to the honorary target.
In the glass cases the fierce rifle battles from which no casual
ties result will furnish the sport for spectators and participants.
.Good shooting is so common at Shell Mound that 'even extra
| ordinary; scores go for nothing. Only the miraculous is of any
consequence. These men, local and Easterners, are showing
. what'. it'is;to have .hairbreadth sights and iron nerves. There is
/a feverish, nervous atmosphere in the shooting section, and con
rviviality "is being postponed until the close of the festival.

SEATTLE, July 18.â Marked with the
scars of many battles with the Ice In
northern waters, with one of her plates
on her port bow stove In by the treach
erous masses, and after an absence of
fifty days, the ] steamer Roanokeâ the
famous treasure ship of the. north â under
the command ' of Captain H. P. Weaver,
arrived in port at noon to-day, with . over
$1,000,000 in gold on board and'slxty pas
sengers. /
It was four years ago that this same
ship arrived in. Seattle from St. Michael
with treasure on board which set the
world afire and started a stampede for the
gold diggings which must forever -stand
unequaled- In the Â¦ history of the world.
Nome was not even thought s of at that
time and the treasure was obtained from
the interior of Alaska. As it was then,
so it- is to-day, for the mines of the In
terior'continue to contribute their yellow
treasure to the marts of .the world, while
a backward season prevents any fair es
timate being inade of . the wealth of the
newer country. - ,
The Roanoke - left Seattle on her first
voyage north -for the present season j on
the morning of May 30, and arrived at
Nome July. 16, being the fourth. vessel to
reach that port this year. Rainstorms
and squalls and occasional hailstorms be
set the vessel on her, northern trip. Dutch
Harbor was reached June 7, and the first
ice was met with fonr days later. All the
afternoon and evening of June 11 the ves
sel did battle with the floating ice, and
at 10:30 p. m. a hole was stove in the port
bow. Fortunately the leak was slight and
temporary repairs were speedily made,
the vessel proceeding on her way.
Vessel Stopped by Ice.
June 14 was spent in' drifting with the
ice-floes, and seldom did; the speed attain
two knots an hour. Nome was reached
on June 16, and from that. date until July
3 the steamer was icebound in Norton
Bay. Â¦ 'Â¦ \. ' Â¦ ; '
The Roanoke left St. Michael on July-5
on her homeward voyage, with sixty pas
sengers and $1,000,000 in gold. Most of the
passengers were from Nome, while fifteen
of them are from the lower Yukon points:
The treasure was consigned to the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company, and nearly $3,500,000 was left at
St. Michael for future shipment. When
the Roanoke left- St. Michael there was a
great rush -from all interior j points for.
Nome, and all down-river streams were
crowded. .The- "steamer Santa: Ana,' the
Government trarsport "Warren, the steam
ers St. Paul, Conemaugh, Buckingham
and'Sewardvwere all In port at " St. Mi
chael. There" were, also the barges Eric
and Ontario; which arrived in tow of the
tug Holyoke July 4.. The steam whalers
Belvedere,- Karluk and Jennie were at an
chor in the harbor. , 'â¢"Â¦ |
Other vessels. reported by the Roanoke
were, the steamship Charles- D. Lane,
which sailed from St. Michael for Seattle
by way of Teller City on the same day
the Roanoke departed; the Nome City,
which arrived at Nome on July 7: the Jen
nie at Dutch Harbor on: the. way to Seat
tle and the revenue cutter Grant and the
whaler Fearless. . â¢ .
The remains of Charles W. Young, who
died at Nome last October, were brought
to Seattle, whence they will be shipped to
the home of the deceased in Michigan. . P.
Harris, a whaler, who boarded the Roa
noke at St. Michael and was on his, way
to. the Marine Hospital at San Francisco,
died at sea of, heart disease on the morn
ing of July 11;- and the body. was. interred

on June 15, causing a loss of: over $50,000.
The flood swept i down Fish' River, "de
molishing buildings, swÂ«eping- away stores
and houses and carrying general devasta
tion in its wake; The damage was almost
entirely confined to Council City and
when the Roanoke departed from Nome,
Council City was said to be in ruins. Only
one house in the whole town was left
standing. "Most of the buildings at Coun
cil City were located on the flat.
On June 17 at midnight the ice broke,
and sweeping over the flat, destroyed
every structure but the Dauntless Hotel,
owned by Joe Dexter. â¢ That was saved by
a heavy log cabin, the property of Harry
Koetz, and although the cabin was de
molished it turned the ice and thus saved
the- Dauntless. The 'North American
Transportation and Trading Company
buildings were located on the flat and all
were demolished and about ten tons of
freight damaged. The people are living
in tents on the hills.

The items given of. Government expenditure show
that while the war tax' has been reduced the expen
ditures for war go on. Thus it is stated that for the
first ten days of this fiscal year the war item amounts
to $6,450,000. Next come the pensions, with $5,810,
000. The civil and miscellaneous budget ranks third,
Despite the increased income the accounts of the
treasury for the first ten days of the fiscal year show
the usual deficit of the season. It amounted this year
to $4,583,815, while last year it was for the corre
sponding period $4,523,287. In spite of the deficit at
the beginning of the last fiscal year the Government
closed the year as a whole with about $75,000,000 to
the good, and it is expected there will be another
favorable showing this year. In fact, the treasury
officials are reported as saying the returns for the first
ten days afford little indication of what the results of
the new revenue law will be.
WHEN the reductions in the war revenue tax
went into effect on July 1 it was expected by
the treasury officials that there would be an
immediate decline in the income derived from them.
There was therefore a good deal of surprise in the de
partment when Â«the receipts for the first ten days of
July amounted to $10,084,495. as compared with re
ceipts of only $8,681,381 for the corresponding
period last year.
An inquiry into the cause of the unexpected in
crease disclosed the fact that a large number of manu
facturers of beer, tobacco, cigarettes, etc., had been
holding off from buying stamps until the reductions
went into effect and then purchased large quantities.
It is said the demand for the new sta'mps is so large
that the stamp division of the internal revenue de
partment has been working overtime in order to sup
ply the new stamps and to take care of the^ old ones.
During the week preceding July 1 the shipments of
new stamps aggregated in value more than $20,000,
000 and weighed about fifteen tons.
NATIONAL REVENUES.
If King Edward is to give James J. Van Alen the
cross of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem in recog
nition of Van Alen's gift of $25,000 to equip a' field
hospital in South Africa, how many crosses could
Pierpont Morgan get if he felt like cornering trie
market? . .
To admit the graduates of one year without exami
nation, while requiring examination of all future
graduates, will seem to the latter and to the public
to be discrimination of a marked character." How
ever, the admission of the present graduates on their
diplomas is so much accomplished for justice. Per
haps others will obtain an equal justice later on. In
the meantime, it is gratifying to note that the con
stitutionality of the law. under which the board is
operating is to be tested in the courts. As has been
pointed out in The Call, there are many objectionable
features in the manner in which it is now being oper
ated, and an investigation in open court may lead to
their elimination.
President Searby's statement was to the effect that
at the June meeting of the board it was decided to
extend the time for filing applications upon creden
tials until August 1 for the express purpose of giv
ing the new graduates of the College of Pharmacy
an opportunity to register without, having to un
dergo examination. He added, "We did this so
there would be no discrimination."
The statement of the president is different from
that originally given out by the secretary of the
board, who in an interview, with a representative of
The Call, published on Wednesday, said: "It is a
fact that all graduates in pharmacy of whatever school
must take an examination before the State board
before they will be registered as licentiates," and when
he was asked if that included graduates of the Cali
fornia College of Pharmacy he replied, "Yes; grad
uates of every college." , /
FROM statements made by President Searby of
the State Board of Pharmacy it appears that
graduates of the California College of Pharmacy
who received their diplomas at the close of the term
just past will not have to pass an examination before
the Board of Pharmacy provided they file applica
tions before August 1. After that date examinations
will be required. 1

PERSONAL MENTION.
ONE of the greatest freaks of nature has recently been discovered close to
the immense tunnel that is nearing completion on the line of the Southern
Pacific running along the boundary line of Los Angeles and Ventura coun
ties Â¦ Â¦'. Â¦
Some workmen employed by the company discovered an immense rock
that Is a perfect.lmage of a man's head. A photograph was taken of this freak of
nature by one of the workmen who had a camera In his possession and it was sent
to ChfefEnglneer Hood of the Southern Pacific. A reproduction of the picture ac-
COn T^e 1 photograph C has been shown to numbers of scientists and globe-trotters, and
they all claim that there is no other rock in existence that is such a perfect rep
resenta ion of a man's head. The rock will no doubt, be looked upon in the future
as one of the points 'of interest in California. Americans can now proudly claim
that California has a sphinx that is just as imposing as that of far away Egypt,
ana that the fpWnx of California took a long time to be discovered, but that It is
older than the Egyptian sphinx and was not made by man. . .
The rock is on Chatsworth Park rancho, the property of Mrs. Johnson.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.

SUBSIDIESâ Subscriber, City. In early
use, subsidy denoted a special tax; then
it was used to' signify the payment of a
sum of money to an ally for assisting In
war. Now the term is applied to pecu
niary aid rendered by a state to Industrial
enterprises of individuals. The granting
of monopoly rights was the earliest form
of subsidies in the United States.
SIGHINGâ A. O. S., Oakland. Cal. A
sigh, about which a great deal of senti
mental stuff has been written. Is, when
viewed in an unsentimental light, a deep,
long drawn, audible respiration. Dr. Car
penter says that sighing is nothing more
than a very long drawn inspiration In
which a larger quantity of air than usual
is made to enter the lungs, and that It
occurs particularly when the attention is
released after having been fixed on an
object which has strongly excited it and
thus has prevented the person from feel
ing the insufficiency of the ordinary
movements of respiration.

The change of front made on the eve of battle
is a remarkable one. Two years ago, when McLean
was nominated for Governor, the Ohio Democrats
declared: "We continue to demand the free and un
limited coinage of silver and gold as equal and pri
mary money at the ratio of 16- to 1, independent of
all other nations in the world. The Hon. William
J. Bryan still retains our entire confidence, and we
demand his renomination in 1000." Mr. Bryan was
renominated in 1900 and the result was so disastrous
to his followers that they have no longer any con
fidence in him or his platform. This year they are to
make the fight without him. It is a complete re
versal of position. The general has been sent to the
rear and the rear guard is given the front place. What
will be accomplished by such tactics remains to be
seen, and that alone gives interest to a campaign
whose results in other respects are in~the nature of
foregone conclusions.
In the field of municipal politics in the'larger cities
the situation is much more interesting. In the spring
contests the Democrats were successful in St. Louis,
Chicago and Cleveland, and consequently they have
high hopes of carrying the elections in other cities.
The chief fight is to be in New York, where various
elements have combined to defeat Tammany. The
combination thus far is but a loose one, and may
not be able to hold together when the strain of the
contest comes, but still the outlook is very promis
ing. Some of the ablest and most influential Demo
crats of the city have pledged their support to the
movement, and it seems therefore that Tammany will
not be able to poll the full party vote in opposition
to the supporters of a ticket pledged_ to reform and
an^hones^ municipal administration.l^,-
It was 'noted in Chicago, St. Louis and Cleveland
that the Democratic successes Were due solely to divi
sions caused in the Republican ranks by the revolt
of the better elements of the party against corrupt
bosses who had obtained control of the party ma
chinery. The moral of that lesson has been thor
oughly learned in other cities. It is safe to say that
in the municipal elections of the fall there will be no
such thing as a boss ticket nominated by a Repub
lican convention in any city of importance from New
York to San Francisco.
It is possible something in the way of national in
terest may be aroused in the Ohio campaign by rea
son of the new depaiture the Democrats have made
in cutting away from Bryanism. The experiment is
certainly worth watching, for the vote will show
whether or no the new departure is sufficiently suc
cessful to make it worth while for Democrats of other
States to take it up next year.
POLITICALLY speaking this is to be a year of
municipal elections. Such State elections as
are to take place are of comparatively little in
terest because the results are not at all doubtful. No
one questions how the majority will vote in Iowa,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio and Virginia.
Four of the five are so strongly Republican that the
Democrats have no chance, while in V rginia the Re
publicans will hardly go through the form of making
a. campaign. â¢
ELECTIONS OF THE YEAR.
'Not a single case of yellow fever appeared in Ha
vana in the month of June, and it is said to have been /
the first time there has been such a clean bill of health
for more than a hundred years. Clearly, therefore,
we have given the Cubans something much better
than the Platt amendment.
This condition reveals the preparation that must
be made before entering upon municipal ownership
if it is to be adopted as a policy beneficial to the
public. The politician and demagogue scout the idea
that anything is necessary except to acquire and
operate. Putting aside' the conclusions of all stu
deuts of the science of government, they assume for
it an inherent virtue which in the. nature of things
is impossible. If a corporate water supply is bad,
they foretell its purification by the simple process" of
changing to municipal ownership. If street cars are
not on time, they will be prompt under municipal
paternalism. And so on to the end of the chapter.
At the same time the demagogues who are out of
office charge up to the demagogues in office the filthy
gutters, the Ifnclean streets, the choked sewers, the
rotten schoolhouses, tlrie swindling contracts, the in
efficient police and .ill the other failures of municipal
government, including its perennial waste and dis
honesty. But the ins and the outs both join in shout
ing for a policy which Will bring about municipal
paternalism over public utilities and give government
more duties to neglect and public officers more
chances to steal.
So far every effort to reform municipal methods
has been a failure. That which the criminal law would
do promptly for a corporation is left undone in the
case of a city.
There is a crying need for legislation that will com
pel public and corporate, or business, bookkeeping
to be identical. All who know anything about cor
porate accounting know the necessity for the great
exactness of it. If the accounts of any great cor
poration were kept like those of any large city in the
country the stockholders would have cause of crimi
nal action against the directors, of which existing
law would take cognizance. This is a startling fact,
that acts criminal in the individual or the corporation
are the settled rule of conduct in municipal adminis
tration.
The public authorities of Tauntbn, Mass., brazened
it out by omitting repairs and betterments on the mu
nicipal electric light plant, until at last the foreman
employed to manage it reports the, plant worn out,
the buildings in danger of falling down, the power
insufficient and the machinery obsoleted by modern
appliances. Yet that plant has figured among those
operated at a profit.
The statement is made that the same vices of account
ing prevail in European cities where municipal pater
nalism is in vogue. There is no sorcery in public
ownership that exempts the plant of a public utility
from depreciation and the necessity of renewal, yet
it is a common thing in American cities to omit re
newal altogether, or, if made, to charge it to another
fund, in order to show a profit upon public opera
tion. The municipal lighting' plant of Alleghany City
has been pointed to as a model example of the great
possibilities of municipal paternalism in the way of
making a_ profit out of public ownership. But an
examination of that plant turns the surplus into a
deficit because the item "depreciation of plant" had
been ignored or charged off to a general fund.
Two remarkable results have followed investigation
of the subject. The first is the discovery by, experts
employed by commercial bodies in New York and
Chicago that it is impossible from the books kept by
the city to ascertain the cost of water, and the second
is 'the stubborn' resistance of city officials -and politi
cians to the institution of a system of bookkeeping
by which the cost can be known. The Illinois Legis
lature at its last session passed a law to reform pub
lic accounting, but it was vetoed at the solicitation of
municipal politicians.
This trick of bookkeeping by which to conceal the
fact that^the waste of public ownership equals the
profits of corporate administration has been found in
operation wherever public ownership is on trial. It
is for this reason that we have been inclined to great
caution, and to resist a plunge into public ownership
on the assumption that its success is demonstrated
by the experiments already made. -
â¢ It is the same story that 'has' been- told. of public
ownership of public utilities everywhere. The Cana
dian Minister had charged the cost of maintenance
and renewal to capital instead of income,, and was
thereby able to show a surplus of earnings over the
cost. of operation.
CANADA has been experimenting with the
public ownership and operation of railroads
on a small scale. The Dominion Minister of.
Railways has been "able to show a surplus every year
from their operation, but at trie recent Session of Par
liament it was shown that .under his , administration
the railroad debt has increased $13,000,000!

It is a striking illustration of the vast wealth", of
this. country .that the; Government can carry on that
amount of expenditure without imposing taxes that
are felt as burdens ito the people." Still it is not pleas
ant-to note that our war expenditures in these times
of peace exceed $640,000 a day. It is now conceded
that we obtained 'little glory out of our war with
Spain, and it begins to be doubtful whether, we are
being $5,670,000. The navy cost $1,870,000. Interest
was $1,700,000, and Indians got $250,009. The total
expenditures were $21,750,000. - " â¢
Max Pemberton will succeed L>r. Conan
Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story in the
Strand Magazine with a serial entitled
"The House Under the Sea," and H. G.
"Wells has just begun a new. serial in
Pearson's for July under the title of "The

a humorous story, being the account of

her experience of submarine life. "Wells
wishes his readers to understand that
mermaids have plenty to read, that they

it by way of argument in favor of the
adaptation of novels to the stage.
By a curious coincidence- two English
novelists have been engaged simultane
ously on stories of the sea, and, what Is
still more strange, stories of under the
sea.
Brereton says the recent production by
Annie Hughes of a dramatic version of
"Vanity Fair" and the coming presenta
tion of another adaptation of the same
novel with Miss Marie Tempest has given
rise again to the statement that popular
novels do not make good plays. Thl3 may
be so in a special sense, but they often
lead to a huge popular personal success.
Brereton, who in such matters is a living

stance of Miss Jennie Lee as Joe in the
dramatization of "Bleak House." It Is a
quarter of a century since Miss Lee made
her first appearance In London as the poor

It will interest readers on both sides of
the Atlantic to know that Austin Brere

Illustrated American, has been appointed
dramatic critic of the Sphere. â¢ Brereton
contributes an agreeable letter. In which
he refers to a subject which, has often
been one of controversyâ namely, do
novels as a rule make good plays?
The injury alleged by Godfrey was that
he has been made the principal character
of the novel and that there are passages
in it calculated to do harm to his profes
sional reputation. Evidently the Jury did
not assess the* damages very highly.

IMPOSING ROCK THAT HAP BEEN RECENTLY DISCOVERED IN THE
SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE. BEARING UPON IT A REMARK
ABLY PERFECT REPRESENTATION OF A.HUMAN HEAD.
No Republican ever answered him or defended the
plank he attacked. The financial doctrinaires who
fortunately dominated the campaign fearlessly denied
'the assumption of the Lodge plank. They denied
that bimetallism was desirable, with the consent of
Europe or without it. They denied that the nations
combined could create value by legislation. They
compelled Republican abandonment of the plank and
a complete commitment to the single gold standard.
As far as we know Mr. Lodge himself never offered
a word in defense of the proposition. It was con
sidered expedient though unprincipled when adopted
'by the convention, and when the high action of the
campaign came on it was considered both unprin
cipled and inexpedient. It held no votes to the party,
and if defended would have repelled many. For
tunately for the party the doctrinaires won, and when
all that they stood for is crystallized into legislation
our financial system will not soon be successfully at-
Had money been a side issue that plank was well
enough for use as a doublc-ender. The party could
have been declared to be in favor of sound money as
2. domestic proposition, but ready to dilute the stan
dard whenever the country could find foreign part
ners in financial folly. But when finance became
the sole issue the small but powerful guild of doc
trinaires could not be trifled with, and when Mr.
Bryan went forth declaring that the Lodge plank
â¢meant that bimetallism was a good thing and neces
sary but we must deny it to ourselves unless Europe
permitted us to enjoy it he made the only point in
all the ocean of words that he uttered.
There are mysteries in the impression upon poli
tics of the minds of men who are apparently non
participants in political effort. It is apparent now
that a powerful portion of the people, powerful in in
tellect and knowledge though not in numbers, be
lieved that the industrial disorders of the country
were of financial and not fiscal origin, that they were
caused by the condition of our basis financial legis
lation and not by changes in our revenue laws. This
powerful intellectual impression existed in both par
tje*. There were clear thinkers in each in this State
and everywhere who held that opinion in common,
though they had never been together to discuss it,
and they acted as one, without organization. Their
position was suddenly strengthened after the Chicago
convention nominated Bryan and denounced the
Cleveland administration for impoverishing the coun
try by its financial policy.
The situation was more- than singular. The cam
paign turned on the money question, and the Repub
licans found themselves defending the financial
measures of Mr. Cleveland, while if they attacked his
tariff views the Democrats were compelled tb defend
him in that particular. In the midst of such hopeless
confusion of issues the compact body of financial
doctrinaires kept the money question above the flood
and led the public sentiment of the country. This
they did by practically leaving the bimetallic plank
in the Republican platform undefended, for the ex
cellent reason that it was incapable of defense.
IN a controversy over the authorship of the bi
metallic plank in the Republican platform of 1896
it has been decided that it was written by Sena
tor Lodge of Massachusetts, to whom has been paid
the $100 which was staked upon the result of the in
quiry.
The authorship of that plank is a doubtful honor.
The most that can be said for it is that when it was
adopted it was not foreseen that the. campaign would
turn upon the money question. The tariff was the
expected issue. The melancholy results attributed
to the Wilson tariff had patched the trousers ef the
country, on teat and knee. The seat was worn out
by sitting in idleness and the knee in praying for
work, wages and better times. Therefore it was in
tended to attack the Cleveland administration on
tariff lines and treat the money question as a side
issue which could be safely temporized with.

CAMP REVERIE, July 16, 1901.â The
weather at Camp Reverie continues perfect,
with no hint of the fog which dwellers in
the bay districts about San Francisco go
away in summer to avoid. Twenty-six
arrivals were registered yesterday, giving
promise with this influx of new talent of
a gay week at the camp.
The impromptu evening entertainments,
where persons of so much and such
varied ability are concerned, must con
tinue delightful. One of the latest pro
grammes gave a piano and flute, duet by
Mrs. Alice Cramer and Dr. Hoppe; a reci
tation by H. R- Wiley: piano selections
by Mrs. Crafts, Oakland's talented or
ganist, and recitations from Tennyson by
Austin Lewis. The whole was inter
nnersed with the humorous stories of Eu-
Kene Del Mar; "The Whittling Philoso
pher" of. the camp, and those of Its pres
ident B B. Payne, whoso fund of post
prandial wit is perhaps only equaled by
that of Chauncey M. Depew.
Since however, as I overheard a lady
say "None but delightful people come to
Camp Reverie," we shall doubtless take
new delight in the arriving speakers of
tvin week Mr. Harry Culmer, the cele
brated artist from Salt Lake City, Pro
fessor Lemmon and others.

It was not until she had her daughter
under the influence of the whip that Mrs.
Thomas began to talk at length.
"Lillie, Lillie," she shouted . again and
again, "ain't you ashamed? I've treated
you so well. Here you've disgraced me by
making me bring you to this notorious
co't and to this notorious whippin' post."
And all this was punctuated with blows.
The Judge stopped the woman when he
thought the girl had been whipped enough
and mother and daughter left the court
together.
Mrs. Thomas, who persisted in calling
the Judge '"Boss," was pleased when he
told her she might whip her girl and then
take her home.
"When niggahs get bad you have to use
de rawhide," was her comment.
Last Monday Llllie Thomas of 609 East
Fifteenth street became very lonely. Lillle
is 12 years old and very black. Her mother
was away from home, and in looking'
about for a good time Lillie took $3 from
Mrs. Martha Elwell, a neighbor. Soda
water, lemonade and candy made rapid
inroads on this capital, and by the time
Mrs. Elwell had told the girl's mother of
the affair Lillie had not one cent left. She
was a very much scared girl when she sat
in court and was told of the gravity of
her offense. %
KANSAS . CITY. July IS.â For the first
time since his "whipping post" has been
established Justice "Walts had a girl
whipped in hia court this morning. Be
fore this the lash has been used on boys
only. A number of them, have been'
whipped for minor offenses, principally
theft. The Judge wa3 unwilling to punish
a girl in this manner, and it took a good
deal of pleading to convince him that such
a course was a good one. The girl's
mother and her lawyer both asked to have
the girl whipped rather than sent to jail.
Finally the Judge yielded and the mother
gave her child the best whipping she has
had for some time. It was, however, so
the mother said, only a forerunner of
what -vtas to come.

The Government has fixed up and
rrjuipped a lighter on which the biff guns
for the Point Bonita fortifications will be
carried. Four permanent ways have
been laid from low water to the top of
the cliff and two B^-inch steel cables
have been affixed to them. When the
barge and her load arrive at the Point
the cables will be made fast around It,
and barge, guns and fittings will be
hauled up over the permanent ways to
the top of the cliff. The first test of the
new scheme will be made with a load of
Lighter for Point Bonita.

NEWS OF THE NOME FIsEET.
The five drunken sailors, who, it Is sur
mised, set fire to the ship, quit work and
went up town just when they were most
wanted. Their excuse was that they were
not supposed to work on Sunday. Later
they wÂ»ere arrested and will have to tell
all they know about the blaze.
While the fire was at its height Captain
Brokaw of the Fearless and Captain Colly
of the Bryant made a daring attempt to
entf-r the hold of the burning bark. They
Â»pre driven back but made a second at
tempt and succeeded. They located the
danger point and after getting back on
deck were able to direct the different
streams of water to the best advantage.
The weight of water gave the bark a
big list to port, but with the aid of a der
rick she was straightened up and then the
Fearless pumped her out. With the ex
ception of the machinery the cargo will be
a total loss, while the bark was consider
ably damaged and will require a thorough
overhauling on her return to San Fran
cisco
As soon as the carpenter discovered the
ship to be on fire he notified Captain Colly
ar.d then an alarm of fire was turned in.
The tug Fearless. Captain "Gil" Brokaw,
late of San Francisco, was soon on the
scene and put five streams into the hold.
The fire department also responded and
pouied water into the bark from, four en
gines. Even with this weight of water
the fire was slow in dying, so two holes
were cut in the port side about five feet
below the 'tween decks and the water
forced into the hold through those. It
took over five hours of constant work,
however, in order to drown out the blaze.
THE bark C. D. Bryant, which left
here June 19, had a narrow escape
from total destruction by fire on
the morning of the 8th lnst. As
It was the vessel had to be prac
tically scuttled before the flames were ex
tinguished. The Bryant arrived at Hono
lulu on July 3 with a cargo of hay, grain,
whisky and machinery- Her deck load of
lumber and livestock had been landed and
some of the merchandise had been re
moved from, the hold. Saturday night
when the men quit work all the hatches
were battened down, but on Sunday
morning when the fire was discovered
by the carpenter the covering of the for
ward hold had been removed. It was in
this hold the whisky was stored, and as
the five sailors on the bark" were drunk
when routed out of the forecastle the sup
position is that they broached cargo dur
ing the night and fired the ship by care
lessness with the matches they used. \

â¢ "I went back to the home," said Beam
er, "and Mrs. Wilson led me to a wood
shed in the rear of the House, where she
said her husband used to-keep his pistol
In a box. I found the pistol in a box that
was at the entrance. It was wrapped in
a piece of cloth and smelt of powder. One
chamber was empty. It contained two
-blank cartridges and three loaded car
tridges. I showed it to AV11
son. 'That is my pistol,' he said. 'It is
the one I had when I was on the force.' "

ing, and that he did not -know when the
other shot had been discharged.
With Wren's testimony the prosecution

ABE FRANK OUTFOGTED
AT THE CHICAGO TRACK
Beaten by Sir Oliver and Memnon in
the Hyde Park Stakes.
TUB preliminary examination of
ex-Policeman Wilson for the mur
der of little Maggie Hartwell was
brought to a sensational close in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday
afternoon. The machinery of the law had
moved slowly. The testimony of all the
witnesses offered by the prosecution was
in. The case had been submitted and the
Judge in even tones had reviewed the
details of the brief trial.",
"I hold," said his Honor, "that the evi
dence introduced in this case tends to es
tablish the fact of the killing of Maggie
Hartwell by the defendant here, Robert
G. Wilson. I further hold that he be held
to answer in the Superior Court before a
jury of his peers. And furth.er that the
charge remain as it is, murder without
bail."
The last word had hardly passed the
Judge's lips when Mrs. Hartwell. the
mother of the little murdered girl, tot
tered to her feet and in shrill toneS called
out: *
"God bless you. Judge Conlan, for that."
A shiver ran through the courtroom.
The defendant's eyes opened wide with
an awful hunted look in them. The
Judge turned, frowned and whispered an
admonitory "hush," and then Mrs. Hart
well lay back with a deep sigh. She had
swooned.
There were many of Mrs. Hartwell's
Shipley street friends in the courtroom.
They rushed to her assistance, and with
the aid of a little cold water and a
draught of cool air they restored the be
reaved mother to consciousness. The
crowd filed out of the courtroom and the
incident was closed.
F. I. Fitzpatrick was the first witness
called. Fitzpatrick took the dying state
ment of the murdered cfiild in the Re
ceiving Hospital on â¢ the evening j of the
Fourth of July. He declared there were
present at the time Officer Folev, Ser
geant Shea, Detective Wren and Dr. Ste
vens. He told how he had questioned the
little girl about the shooting and how she
had told him that she was playing on the
street with other girls and boys shooting
off firecrackers and how ex-Offlcer Wilson
George JlcOermott, the last of the "lion
comiques." died recently in London. It
was he who introduced the song:, "We
Don't Want to Fight, but by Jingo If We
Do."
The plans of the buildings, which are
twelve in number, -were drawn bv a Gov
ernment architect. They represent build
ings of the mission type and all are to be
completed by next March. The total cost
will be $159,uO0.
Features of unique interest were the ad

Evans was hit freely, and at times was
rather wild, giving free transportation to
six of the Dudes. Croll made a sensa
tional catch of Moskiman's long hit to
center in the fourth, robbing the "Doctor"
of a two-base hit. Drennan also accepted
a hard chance in the eighth, making a
long running- catch of Croll's hit to the
center garden.
The same teams will line up for battle
to-day. Following is the official score,
which tells how San Francisco lost the I
grame:
SAX FRANCISCO.
Two more runs were added to Oaklad's
score, one In the sixth and another in
the seventh, making a total of five, Mos
kiman, for the Dudes, pitched a good,
steady game, allowing but three scatter
ed hits and walking only two men. He
also distinguished himself by putting the
ball over the center field fence in the
sixth, but, fortunately for the Germans,
the bases were empty. Arrellanes, Dren
nan and Francks also shared honors in
the batting-, the first named hitting- out a
three-bagger and each of the latter get
ting a two-cushion swipe.
San Francisco and Oakland opened this
week's series at Recreation Park yester
day afternoon with disastrous results to
the locals, they being outclassed at every
point in the game by the balltossers from
Oakland. Uncle Hank's men secured bul
one run to five scared by the men from
across Hie pond.
San Francisco started out like a sure
winner. Croll sent, a hot one* to Francks,
who threw badly to Eagan, "Steamboat"
taking second on the play. Hlldebrand
KacrlHced, advancing Croll to third. Pabst
followed Iiildey's example, scoring Croll.
Ivrugr then hit an easy one to Arrellanes,
retiring the side. This ended the run
getting of the home nine.
Neither Bide did anything more until
the fifth, When Drennan got to first on
Krug's error. Moore hit to Schwartz,
who made an error out of an easy one,
putting two men on bases. "Dutch"
Streib advanced to the plate, straighten
ing out one of Evuns' curves for a sacri
fice nnd advancing- Drennan and Moore.
"Truck" Kagan lined out a hot one' to
Krug, who succeeded In piling up another
error, Drennan scoring on the play. The
'Germans seemed to go to pieces in this
innlne and when the dust had cleared
a'/ay the bell rang three times for Ew
ing's men, Dunleavy and Eagan having
scored in the mlxup.

either time. Last year he stood at twenty
yards In the target handicap, but did not
get a place In the first sixteen. This year
the handicapping committee placed him
at nineteen yards, and after a spl'endid ex
hibition with the shotgun he beat all the
others, breaking: So out of 100 targets.
F. V. Carlough of Rutherford. N. J.,
shooting from the sixteen-yard mark,
broke ninety-three and secured second
money, while Charles Wagner of Sche
nectady, N. T., broke ninety- two at a
distance of seventeen yards from the
traps.
On the whole the conditions to-day were
satisfactory, as the weather -was clear and
a good light wind prevailed. Five sweep
stake events, each at sixteen yards rise,
were decided prior to the handicap, and
in these Crosby carried off the honors, as
he did not miss a single target, making: a
continuous run of eighty-five straight tax
gets. Following is the score:
Before the handicap 'was shot off five
sweepstakes events were decided. Results;

The Heal Cause of Dandruff and

At one time dandruff was attributed to
be the result of a feverish condition of
the scalp, which threw 'off the dried cu tl-
Â¦cle>'ln - scsiles."l' Â¦'Â¦*' Â¦Â¦^^-^- 'Â¦'â¢'. " ' *sx
Professor Unna, ' Hamburg. Germany,
noted authority on skin diseases, explodes
this theory and Bays that dandruff Is a
g-erm disease.
This germ Is really responsible for the
dandruff and for so many bald heads. It
can be cured if it is gone about ln the
right way. The right way, of course, and
the only way, is to kill the grerm.

f OIL JOED AX A CO., 1051 Market Ht. S. F. Von horseback; and our. Methodism, has been on
the go or t"he gallop ever since. . ' I do not In
dulge ' in anything like poetic license when I
-Â«ay that these old saddle-bag preachers who
crossed the line together with their successors
did mere to lay the moral foundations of our
country than any -other agency. The dust of
many of those American pioneer preachers
bleeps in many an unmarked grave, but some
of them deserve a cenotaph in Westminster
Abbey.
They were mighty men. They were not all
college bred. In ridicule some of them have
been called graduates â¢ of bush colleges and
fellows of swami) university, but they were
the men who knew how to reach the hearts oC
our people and struck at the evils of their
times as with the strokes of a sledgehammer.
Yes, they were great men. They belonged to
a ssecial and spiritual peerage. It is true
they lacked the dilettantism of the modern
divine, who described a tear as that small
particle of aqueous fluid trickling from the
visual organs over the facial lineaments, in
dicating ecstatic- joy or bitter grief, but their
preaching often brought tears of penitence to
eyes that had never, wept. for sin before. Like
Bruce's army at Bannockburn, these men won
their victories upon their knees. But it was such
preaching and praying that gave us a Chris
tian Canada, bo that the 'bond that binds our
hearts to your treat Methodist church is'one
that can never be broken.
. And, sir, in Canada we Â¦were constantly re
minded'that all your great men are not dead.
,We had evidence to that effect. â¢ if such were
needed, -at the last international convention oÂ£
Epworth Leaguers which met In Toronto.
â¢ The closing remarks of the day were
made by H. M. DuBose, general secre
tary of the Epworth league. of the M. E.
church South. He also spoke In the high
est terms of appreciation, of the royal re
ception and welcome which the Epworth
League : delegates have received in this
city and State. He dwelt eloquently on
the great achievements which have char
acterized the course of the league in the
past and drew a brilliant picture of Its
future possibilities. Notwithstanding the
lateness of the hour and the number of
speeches which had been made previous
ly, his remarks were received with ap
plause.
Just previous to adjournment a tele
gram conveying the congratulations and
best wishes of State President Lyonel S.
Rodgersof the State Christian Endeavor
Union was received and read.
The proceedings of the initial day of the^
great convention were fittingly brought
to a close with music from the choir and
prayer by Bishop Joyce, president of the
Epworth League.

;, The^ following song of greeting . has
served to -while away the weary hours
passed by the Alameda County section
of the reception committee while waiting
for belated ; trains. It was comDosed by
Miss May Dunsmore, a member of the
Chester Street Epworth League' of Oak
land, and A.. Sandholf of the Swedish
League of Oakland, both of whom are
aids .in the Oakland section. It is
adapted to the air of "When the Roll Is
Called Up Yonder," and when sung with a
full chorus has a peculiar effect:
EpworthXeague Welcome Song-, 1901
California bids you welcome to this land of
sun and flowers.
To this land beside the wide Pacific Sea,
We greet you, Epworth Leaguers, and a happy
band is ours, â *

ROCK COMfeS
IN WINDOW
Narrow Escape of Ep
v worth League
Guests.
BERKELEY,' July !Â§.â Without the
slightest warning some 'one hurled a rock
through the front window of Judge' W.
G. Witter's house, at 2301'Durant avenue,
last night at 9:30 o'clock. The parlor was
crowded with guests and splinters of
glass flew over the people, cutting several
but none seriously.
Judge Witter was entertaining friends
from Wisconsin who are delegates to the
Epworth League convention when the un
provoked assault occurred. After the
first excitement several men ran from the
house in an effort to catch the miscreant,
but no one was found. The rock, although
not large, was heavy enough to carry
well. '* :'Â¦Â¦ â¢' Â¦Â¦- , - â¢
Judge Witter has lived here but a short
time. He can give no explanation for the
attack. .He has offered $50 reward for the
capture of the rock thrower. . Â¦:Â¦,

WHERE CANADA
GOT METHODISM
Rev. J. Henderson of Toronto
.Speaks of League in His
v -Country.
Rev. James Henderson of. Toronto, Can
ada, responded to the welcome in behalf
of the Canadian contingent. He said in
part: '
I am reminded to-day of our great obligation
to ycuâ that which has made us largely what
we are. It was from- you, sir, we got much
of our- Methodism. Your adventurous -Wil
liam Losee was the morning star of the Meth
odist church in the wilds of Canada. And
among the names which shine the brightest on
the â¢ roll of Methodistic Â¦ fame in our coun
try are those of Dunham and Ruter and Bangs
and Black and Freeborn Garretson, the latter of
whom,. sir, you will remember was converted
LEAGUE TENETS :
ARE OUTLINED
Eloquent Address of Bishop
I. W. Joyce/: President j
of the League. ;
The first response to the welcomes ex
pressed by the previous speakers was
voiced by Bishop I. W. Joyce, president
of the league. When the applause that
greeted his appearance in the rostrum had
subsided he said, in' clear, resonant tones:
Mr. President: "We are glad to have theee
words cf greeting and of welcome.. They do us'
good. Kind words., are always refreshing â
especially to strangers. Â¦ This Epworth League
Conference Is made up of representatives from
the country charge, the village church and the
city station. We come from the farm, the
store ar.d the' shop, k from' the factory and the
of rice. We come from " the academy and the
college and the schools of - the great profes
sions. â¢- ' - Â¦ Â¦ . . . -
Ministers of the gospel are here. Lawyers
and physicians are present; Editors and re
porters are of Our number, and one spirit ani
mates all these delegations and the entire con-
ference. One purpose will give coloring to all
utterances and: actions during this conference,
and that will be how to better serve that for
which the Epworth League stands, s'o that'we
can best serve Jesus Christ.and.his -world-em
bracing cause. Many of us â¢ have been for. a
long- while looking forward to this occasion â
been anticipating the pleasure of the journey
to this city. :â¢'; ' . , â¢ .
Well we have seen the attractive plains and
pawsed through the fertile hill country, and we
have been made glad by the scenery of Â¦ the
mountain ranges, . and the ride down the Pa
cific slope has. satisfied us in every particu
lar. We are here from all parts of the United
States and from the- Dominion of Canada. . In
deed, I would not be far from the ' real facts
If I should say "the blood- of: marty nations
is represented in this < Epworth . Conference."
And if I may Be allowed"' Â«. *en1i-prophetic
view of what may take place in the coming
years, I would say "It may be that some fu
ture Epworth .international conference will be
made up of delegates from every, nation on the
faca of the earth."
An Occasion of Gladness.
Our surroundings at this hour are most
happy, and the occasion is' filled with the
spirit of a great gladness. In the providence
of God we are here in the city of San Fran
cisco.
We recognize the fact that many thousands
of people during the years pass through this
citj. going to the most distant parts of the
earth or coming from the same. Some of these
multitudes are missionaries, going in the name
of our Lord, with the Word of .Life to heathen
people, and others are of the same class,^re
turning from their distant fields with broken
health, coming home to rest, regain health
and return to their deeplv loved work.
Others of these numbers are in queBt of for
tune, or of health, or of intellectual gains, or
of pleasure, while in very recent years thou
sands of American boys have passed through
this city to render service under the Stars and
Stripes in the interest of humanity in dis
tant lands. Many of them were members of
the Epworth League and there on the fields,
of battle, as everywhere, they were true to a
great principle, and did their duty well.
We also recognize the fact that in this city
there are many who love the Lord Jesus
Christ, and are in alliance with' him for the
best service they can render In enlarging' the
kingdom of our Lord In the earth. â¢ We wish
to say to these friends that we hope 'our com
ing among them will be to them a spiritual
blessing.
To the best of our knowledge and belief
every one of these thousands of leaguers come
from a Christian home and each one is him
self a Christian.
The city will suffer no ill from the presence
of such a company of people. They will send
their prayers to heaven in your behalfâ that
God will bless you in all things and keep you
in great peace.
This Epworth conference, Jt seems to me.
should be a blessing to this, city and to our
selves also. - -
THe purpose in coming here is not a common
or an ordinary one. It is to help and be
helped.
What the Emphasizes.
The things the Epworth League emphasizes
indicate its character and reveal the kind of
.service it tries to render. They are:
First â Right personal relations with God.
. Secondâ True Christian character.
Thirdâ Best Christian living.
Fourthâ Courageous, useful, Christian service.
The central secret of the whole Is fellowship
with God.
It is a great work to win men to Christ; to
build them up in righteousness- and send them
forth for high service in the interest of the
kingdom of Jesus Christ.
In this way- Christ becomes more than mere
teacher. He becomes Savior to each one;
purifier of the soul. He becomes leader in
paths of safety that lead to victory.
This enriches with the strongest thinking,*"
the purest affection, right living, and bravest
doing, and these\ will crowd the best workers
to the front In all forward movements in the
church of God.
The hope of humanity Is in Jesus Christ.
The doctrines he taught and the principles
he announced grow upon the conscience and
judgment of thoughtful men as the centuries
go by.
The Epworth League Is intended to stand
for him, and to contend for everything he
taught, and for everything he wants men to
be and to do.
We cannot overlook the fact ' that problems,
world wide in importance and interest, con
front the church of Jesus Christ to-day. Some
of them are of a character she never faced
before. They affect the man and the child,
the home and society/the State and its Instil
tutlons. Multitudes of the most devout aTid
thoughtful men and women in the land are
deeply concerned over the gravity of the sit
uation indicated by .some of these problems.'
Rev. J. C. Simmons Believes
Young Leaguers Do
Much Good.
The Rev. J. C. Simmons of Woodland
was introduced as the Nestor of Jhe Meth
odist Episcopal Church South. The-vet
eran minister was accorded a flattering
'reception. He expressed the welcome to
the delegates in behalf of California
Methodism. He said In part:
When California opened her .heart to entend
an invitation to the great International Ep-'
worth League- Conference, she had back of
that a welcome as cordial as the invitation.'.
California is known all over the world for its
big things. We can fearlessly throw down the
graur.tlet and defy the world to beat ftsâ even
In bragging. And I fear if we were to tell
you how welcome you were to our hearts and
our homes you could â¢ hardly, .comprehend us
and would perhaps think we were bragging.'
But it will require only a few. hours' inter-,
course with us to convince you that all we -say:
is hi sincerity. -, â¢ .' '
"., But. .while we sive you a welcome as wide
as our fertile 'valleys and ' as . deep as ' our
mighty rivers, yet we do not want' to give all.
We look to you fora great spiritual, uplift that
will make California, rood as. well as great..
We look to you to burnish our gold and to set
it with new and rare gems and to glorify It
â¢with the splendors of a. holy zeal for the cause
of- our common .. Master. "â¢ We â¢ expect great
things from you and trust, that yomvlrifluerice"
for good will be; as -wide as : the; welcome we'
give you. T " *'.'Â¦-Â» Â¦.â¢Â¦,' â¢ .' â¢'Â¦':'.â¢% ' Â¦Â¦ , 'â'Â¦â¢â¢â¢'Â¦>â¢ Â£?*
The Rev. Mr.. Simmons'- address was In
terspersed with humorous y anecdotes,
which kept the convention in high good
humor. When, in 'his peroration, 'he al
luded to God as knowing no difference be
tween a Methodist from the North or
the Methodist' from the South. 1 the au
dience rose to its feet in v a burst of en
thusiasm. 'At/the close ' of the address
Rev. Mr. Simmons was cheered. . -"* *

announced that after three
months' trial of a provincial
form of government in the
Islands of Cebu and Bohol and -the prov
ince of Batangras, Luzon, control of those

CHICAGO, July 18.â Early reports of inter
est to corn traders gave the impression that
last night's rains were more liberal than was
afterward thought, to be. the case, and in con
sequence sufficient corn was offered to depress
the price from %c to %c. There was a steady
country demand, however, and a rally from
tO@SO%c, the opening figures, to 51%c ensued.
Profit-taking caused a fractional setback, but
sentiment was gradually becoming decidedly
bullish on - numerous damage claims which
came in a flood from the corn belt. â¢ Finally
the Impression became general that the rains
last night had been little better than local
showers In scattered districts, and a rush of
buying sent September to 52c. The close' soon
after was strong, l%c over yesterday, at 51%c.
Oats were strong and active, advancing with
scarcely a setback throughout the day. The
corn strength was of course a help, but in the
main the advance' was due to continued buy-
Ing for the country account, apparently con
firming reports of a short crop. September
closed lVi@l%c higher at- 33@33%c.' '
Reports of beneficial rains in the wheat zone
remained an influence in the wheat market
throughout the session, its greatest potency
being at the opening when September sold
from %@"ic lower at. 67%@67%c. Buying large
ly for the Southwest .caused a rally to 68%c
early, but In sympathy with weakness in the
markets of the Northwest, a further decline
to 67Vic followed. Later. damage claims from
the spring wheat territory, the strength of the
coarse grains and heavy exports resulted in a
rally to CSHc and the close was firm %c lower
at 68%c.
Provisions were dull, fluctuating: narrowly,
but holding steady In sympathy with corn and
on higher prices at the yards. September pork
and 'lard closed 7>4c higher and ribs unchanged.

cults turned out much better than expected.
In spite of the damage done, therefore, it
6â¬-en;s probable that we shall have a crop of
at Least ].&O0.fiO0.OW) bushels, which at the high
er prices current will bring increased prosper
ity where crops are good, as a partial offset
to losses where crops are bad. A smaller crop
of oats is expected than last year, but the
yield of this grain promises above the aver
age. A marnificent wheat crop is practically
assurc-d ml over 700.0on.00O bushels, the heaviest
on record; and as Europe will be forced to
make large demands upon our surplus the bene
ficial effect of this upon Western trade and
our foreign trade balance will be important
latT on. While crop damages must be con
ceded there is nothing yet approaching a cala
trjty."
How Wall street looks at the crop prospects
Is set forth in the circular of Henry Clews,
under date of July 13, as follows:
"Factors unsettling the stock market were
the etee! strike, the threatened war of rates
In the "tVes=t and crop damages. Only the lat
ter cause was entitled to any serious consid
eration. Strikes and railroad wars rarely as
sume serious proportions in prosperous periods.
The injury to the con crop, however, is a much
more important matter. Very likely present
reports of damage are much exaggerated, yet
It Is certain that rerious damage has been
done in Kansas and some other regions, so that
roads dependent upon those sections must ex
pect to suffer in earnings. Kansas is fifth
among the great corn-producing States and
turned out 163.S0O.CGO bushels of corn last year,
or less than S per ce-.t of the total crop. Last
year we had a drouth scare in July, but re-
Wheat, Oats and Corn.
â¢â¢Apricots are going out a little more freely,
both td the domestic and export trade, demand
being- mostly for fancy grades. There is a
fair busiVss in a small way also in the fancy
peaches and in prunes. Evaporated apples are
firm at unchanged prices, with some demand
from Jcbl>ers for prime. Chops and waste are
quiet and rather easier."
â¢Trade In dried fruits continues to be con
fined almost to buying for immediate wants,
but orders range a little larger and the de
mand is more active than it has been. The
epot mark<?t Is featureless, however, and the
business doing Is well distributed among the
leading lines. Raisins locally are in fair re
quest, sale of one lot of about 100 boxes of
3-crown layers being reported at {1 50. Coast
advices report the purchase by a prominent
California packing company. with Eastern
headquarters in this city, of around 5300 boxes
of 2, 3 and 4 crown layer raisins. This sale,
it Is said, cleans up the association's holdings
of layere. There are rumors of important
raifin deals pending: here on present associa
tion holdings. Imported Sultanas are meeting
With some sale at the lower quotations of
11%, 12% and 13%, for 2. 3 and 4 crown layers.
Mall advices from New Tork say
Raisins and Dried Fruit in New
104%. compared with 102% last night- and of
St. Paul 8000 at 165%@165, compared with 163%
last night. United States Steel was also dealt
In to the extent of 8000 shares, varying in
prices from 40%@41U. compared with 40% last
night. The price of this stock at cho opening
was the highest of the day and It was under
steady pressure through the mutations of the
market, getting down nearly a point under last
night and closing at a fractional net loss. The
whole market felt the effect almost immediate
ly of enormous realizing sales and the succes
sive declines suggested the conjecture that in
side Interests, which bought stocks yesterday,
were selling out to take profits. The belief pre
vailed In the board that the large capitalists
who supported the market on Monday and
Tuesday by buying practically all offerings of
the leading stocks were lightening their load,
taking of the Northern Pacific an
nouncement to reduce their holdings. The rath
er palpable manipulation of the market and
the circulation of vague intimations that fur
ther disclosures were coming of additional ar
rangements under, the Northern Pacific settle
ment added to this impression. Rather frank
admissions were forthcoming that the an
nouncement of the Northern Pacific settlement
was timed with a view to quieting apprehen
sions in the stock market, against the earlier
deciMon of those interested to withhold the an
nouncement until a later period. This gave
color to the belief that the policy . thus
adopted to rally the stock market had in view
as well the moral effect upon the steel
strike situation of an advance in the Steel
stocks. These conditions served to take the
edge off the fact of the announcement of
the Northern Pacific settlement. There was a
period after midday when, the general level of
prices had receded well below last night, even
Union Pacific and St. Paul showing losses. The
weakness in Atchison, Rock Island, the coal
ers and some of the Southern lines was quite
pronounced. It was late In the day when
Union Pacific began its final upward movement.
The demand for the stock was apparently in
satiable, blocks of 1000 to 4000 shares succeed
ing each other in quick succession. Every ef
fort was also apparent to bid up the price of the
stock. It touched 109 before the close, and St. .
Paul was lifted to 16SV4. and Southern Pacific
to 57. The market rallied in sympathy but
did not generally get back to the best. Chi
cago and Northwestern rose 6 and General
Electric 8H- The buoyant rise in Union Pacific
revived the belief In further developments In
the. community of interest plan in the West.
The closing was feverish and irregular below
the best.
The railroad bond market was" active and
continued slightly- Irregular, in spite of a late
improvement. Total sales, par va'.ua $2,
970.000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

EARL RUSSELL
GOES TO PRISON
House of Lords Gives
Him a Term of Three
Months.
Accused Nobleman Pleads Ig-
norance of the Law as
) His Defense,
LONDON, July 18.â Earl Russell, ar
raigned at the bar of the House of Lorda
to-day on the charge of bigamy, pleaded
guilty after lengthy arguments against
the Jurisdiction of the court. The trial
was carried on with all the quaint middle
age ceremonies. The arguments lasted
one hour.' Both the Earl and the Coun
tess (Mrs. Somerville), through their coun
sel, pleaded that they did not know they
were doing wrong, but had acted on thÂ«
best legal advice obtainable in Nevada.
The Peers reached their decision after
consideration of the case, lasting twenty
minutes. Earl Russell was sentenced tot
three months' imprisonment as a first
class misdemeanant.
In anticipation of the arrival of Lord
Russell the officials of Holliday Prison
have prepared for his reception one of tha
rooms formerly o'ecupied by William. T.
Stead, the editor, and members of tha
Jameson raiders. It is a commodious
apartment, in which his Lordship can ba
supplied with his own food and wines.
Ancient Ceremonial in Force.
The scene In the Royal gallery, tem
porarily converted into a court of Justice,
when the Lord High Chancellor, Lord
Halstoury, who had been appointed Lord
'High Steward for the occasion, took his
seat upon the dais and the quaint cere*
monial began, was most picturesque. Tha
hall was a magnificent blaze of color, pro
duced by the robes of the Peers, the aca
demic robes of tha Judges and the bril
liant uniforms of his state officers. Al
though the House of Lords was not rep
resented in its full strength, about 200 of
Earl Russell's peers attended his trial and
made an imposing array as they filed into
the hall, two by two, from behind tho
throne. Lord Salisbury, the Premier,
brought up the rear of the procession and
was almost unnoticed as be took his seat
near Lord Halsbury.
Immediately beneath the dais eat tha
ten Judges in their gorgeous robes, sur
rounded by a phalanx of lesser legal
luminaries. On either side of the Judges
were ranged five benches filled with Peers,
whose ranks were distinguishable by tha
varying number of rows of ermine and
gold lace on their scarlet mantels.
The benches reserved for Peeresses were
amply filled, while the space allotted to
distinguished strangers was crowded with
the diplomatists and their families. In
cluding the United States Embassador,
Joseph H. Choate, and the Secretary oC
the United States Embassy, Henry White.
Mollie Cook, otherwise Mrs. Somervllle,
Earl Russell's present wife, entered tha
hall by ticket and sat facing the benches
occupied by members of the House- o2
Commons. She was accompanied by a.
young woman dressed in gray and wear
ing a hat trimmed with cream lace. Mol
lie Cook appeared no more concerned than
the other witnesses of the interesting
scene.
Nevada Judge Present.
Among the witnesses who entered the
hall was Judge Curler of Nevada, who
took a seat beside the clergyman who
married Earl Russell to Mabel Scott, his
first wife.
The court was formally opened with a
series of quaint ceremonies and the ex
change of stately phrases prescribed In
the ancient legal procedure.
Beside Lord Halsbury, in his Earl's
robes and a wig, stood General Sir Mi
chael Blddulph, gentleman usher of tho
black rod, and William Henry Weldon,
Esq., the Norroy-king-of-anns, in a re
splendent tunic
"Our sovereign lord and King, shouted
the Norroy-king-at-arms, "charges and
commands all manner of persons to keep
silence on pain of imprisonment."
Another official, on bended knee, handed
the commission to the Lord High Chan
cellor, who, while handing It to another
kneeling clerk, said:
"Let all be uncovered while the com
mission is read."
After the necessary ceremonies, Earl
Russell was conducted to the bar. Ha
calmly surveyed his Judges and Peers.
Then a clerk of Parliament cried loudly:
"John Francis Stanley, Earl Russell,
come forth and surrender to bail or for
feit recognizance."
"How Say You, My LordP"
Then Black Rod, bedecked with medals
and in uniform, approached the bar,
which was raised as the Earl drew near,
and surrendered Earl Russell. Upon
reaching his appointed seat. Earl Russell
stood leaning against the table and then
made obeisance three times to the Lord
High Steward. He remained with bowed
head until the latter addressed the ac
cused. Then the Indictment was read by
the clerk, who concluded with these
words:
"How say you, my Lord, guilty of
felony, or not guilty?"
Before Earl Russell could answer his
counsel objected to the indictment on tha
ground that the alleged offense was com
mitted outside the dominions of His Ma
jesty, King Edward. During the course*
of the technical and tiresome argument
by the Earl's counsel the prosecution
summoned Judge Curler within the bat*
to confer on certain points raised in coun
sel's argument.
After the reply of the prosecution to tho
argument of counsel for the defense Earl
Russell, In a voice scarcely audible.
pleaded guilty. His counsel then ad
dressed the House in mitigation, urging
that the accused had acted on the best
legal advice obtainable in Nevada, that
the offense was merely technical and that
no harm had been done. Lord Russell ad
dressed the House in the same strain, say
ing the decree received in the United!
States gave special sanction to a new;
marriage.
Earl Russell said he proposed to re
marry Mollie Cook as early as possible.
Concluding, he said he placed himself in
their Lordships' hands, that he had acted
in ignorance and with no intention of
willingly defying the law.
The .peers retired to consider their ver
dict. When they had reassembled tha
Lord High Steward called for the prison
er. The whole House rose to its feet when
the Lord High Steward proceeded to de
liver the judgment. While the crime could
not be passed over, said the Lord High
Steward.- there were several mitigating
circumstances. In consideration of and as
a result of these their Lordships had
unanimously declared that justice would
be satisfied by his being imprisoned In
Holloway prison for three months as a
criminal in the first degree.

CRIPPLE CREEK,' Colo., July 18.â The
Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress
to-day completed the most important of
its work by adopting resolutions covering
a multitude of subjects of interest to the
great West, and selecting, the Twin Cities
âSt. Paul and Minneapolisâ as the next
place of meeting. The only debate of the
session which at any time threatened to
disturb the harmony of the occasion came
up over the resolutions proposing the es
tablishment of Government departments
of mining and of commerce and industry.
Tho friends of the former feared that the
adoption of the latter would; be inimical
to their hopes, the danger being that. the
mining- industry might be relegated to a
bureau of some other department. The de
bate was led by H. R. Whitmore of St.
Louis and F. I. Thurber of New York. on
the side of the department of commerce
and industry- - Hon. B. "F. Montgomery,
Speaker of the Colorado Legislature, and
former Governor Adams of Pueblo, Colo.,
spoke foa the mining department. Finally,
on motion of ex-Governor Prince of New
Mexico, the industrial feature was strick
en from the resolution advocated by the
Eastern delegates, and both Â¦ departments
were then unanimously indorsed.
Many Recommendations Made.
Governor FIshback of Arkansas, chair
man of the committee on resolutions, read
the report of the committee, which was
adopted after considerable debate. Among
other measures It favors the construction
by the general Government of reservoirs
and canals for the reclamation of arid
lands, and the enactment of laws, State

Shaffer Goes to Wellsville.
The following was received to-day from
Wellsville: "The storm center of the
great strike was to-day moved from
Pittsburg tbthis little Columbiana County
village. News that the Wellsville plant
of the American Sheet Steel Company
was now in shape to run in full and that
men would be Imported from Vandergrift,
Pa., and other points to work all mills,
caused President Shaffer of the Amalga
mated Association to 'rush here from
Pittsburg to give courage to the striking
millmen.
"The Amalgamated officials. Trustee
John A. Morgan, Vice President John A.
Chapelle and President Shaffer were al
most smothered by the crowd which
greeted them here on their arrival. A pro
cession of several thousand people fol
lowed them to the city hall, where the
public meeting was held, and at which
President Shaffer was the principal
speaker. About 2000 people were crowded
into the hall before the party from. Pitts
burg reached the platform. The address
of President Shaffer was listened to with
deep interest. President Shaffer cautioned
the men to keep within the bounds of the
law, and, above all, to abstain from,
drinking."
Firemen Must Resume Work.
WILKESBARRE. Pa,, July 18.â The
coal operators and the striking- station
ary firemen of the Wyoming Valley take
opposite views of the action of the execu
tive committee of the United Mine Work
ers, which met in Scranton to-day. The
committee decided that all firemen -who
are members of the United Mine Workers'
organization must return to work.
The operators think this is a severe
blow to the men on strike, and one from
which they cannot recover. On the other
hand the strikers claim that it will not
affect them much, as only a compara
tively few firemen belong to the United
Mine Workers. It would seem that a
settlement of the strike now rested with
the mine employes themselves and not
with the operators. The United Mine
Workers have apparently declared for
one policy and the stationary firemen for
another. There are 70.000 miners in the
Wyoming- and Lackawanna region Â¦ and
only about 1800 firemen. If the coal com
panies can secure enough firemen who
are members of the United Mine Workers
to do their work in the boiler-rooms there
is nothing to prevent them from start
ing their, collieries. '

as English; in favor of establishing a ju

the addition of an insurance feature to
the scope of the order's activities.
Reports received from the various subor

PITTSBURG, July 18.â Most Important
of all news regarding the steelworkers'
strike that reached Pittsburg to-day was
the action of the men employed in the
Duncansville plant of the American Steel
Hoop Company. A. telegram was re

in the morning, asking if they should
strike. The message was a surprise for
the Amalgamated people, as they were
not looking for this news so soon. Presi
dent Shaffer answered, telling the men not
to go out unless they were organized. If
organized, they should strike, for they
were needed. In the afternoon a telegram
was received .from Duncansville, asking
that an organizer I be sent to them at
once. '
In compliance with this request Vice
President John Pierce started for Dun
cansville this evening to complete the or
ganization. The Duncansville plant is the
last of the hoop plants to remain at work,
and the Amalgamated Association officials
say that if they are successful in closing

STRIKE IS GIVEN
UNEXPECTED AID
If the men In the employ of the Morton
Special Delivery Company cannot be In
duced to Join the local Brotherhood of
Teamsters, or if that concern does not
recognize the union, there will be a team
sters* strike. Some weeks ago the San
Francisco Labor Council declared its in
tention to levy a boycott against that
company, but no further action was taken.
There arÂ« two companies bearing the
r.ame of Morton. One is the Morton Dray
age end Warehouse Company, and the
other the Morton Special Delivery Com
pany. - â¢Â¦-'.â¢â¢
The former Is a member of the Dny
men's Union and employs none but union
men. The latter is not a unltJh establish
ment, but has business relations with the
former. Brothers are the active mana
gers of both concerns and other business
relations are as equally intimate as they
are fraternal. For some reason not ap
parent as yet the Bromerhood of Team
sters has declared war upon the Morion
Drayage Company.
It u-as generally expected that a large
amount of baggage would have to bo
handled in a hurry during the rush of visi
tors to the Epworth League convention,
tnd this time was considered appropriate
to declare war against the Mortons. But
&s most of the visitors were traveling
"iight," the occasion only arose once
where an outside truck v.-as needed. This
was loaded up and since then the Morton
Special Delivery Company, with its regu
lar force has been enabled to handle all
baggage intJ usted to its care.
Both the Draymen's Association and the
Btotherhood of Tenmstc-rs heid meetings
vt-sterday. but r.o definite conclusion was
reached." The Brotherhood of Teamsters
had a long meeting- last nipht and decided
practically lt> await the action of the
Draymen's Assuciaiion. The latter has
decided to nutrt again to-night at the Al
cazar building and take such action as
mav be required. Neither side was pre
pared yesterday to take definite action.
Secretary Geosg<? Etetmer of the Dray
mpn'.-; Association s^ys ihe men have been
fc-ranted all their aemands. and that tiie
Draymen's Association, of which the Mor
ton Drayage and Warehouse Company is
t member, will be sustained, as the eon
trai'i aritb ilif Morton Special Delivery
Company was made nine months ago, long
before tiie Brotherhood cf Teamsters pre
sented the demanis for wages and hours
which were Jaier grunted. Both sides are
Â¦tnbbora a::d are watching each other's
moves.
Aseptic Eules for Barbers.
Ajoir.t meeting of the Master Barbers'
Association, ihe journeymen Barbers' In
ternational t'nion a:id the Barbers' Pro
tective Union was b. !d last night to dis
cuss the new sanitary rules proposed by
the State Board of Barber Examiners for
the consideration of the State and local
Boards of Health. Some barbers have ob
jected to the proposed new rules, as they
were likely to cause considerable ex
pense. A long discussion, in which every
feature was considered, consumed the
greater portion of the evening-, and while
no definite result was reached a commit
tee was appointed to consider the plans
end co-operate with the State Board of
Barber Examiners. A further meeting
will be held on Monday night at 32 O'Far
rell street, by which time It is hoped to
have the report ready.
In order to prevent a repetition of the
troubles between the street sweepers who
have been discharged by Gray Bros, and
the men working at present a large force
of police guarded the sweepers last night.
Harry Gray says the disturbance of
Wednesday night was caused by men for
merly employed by the City Street Im
provement Company, who. Gray claims,
were incited to this action by President
Mcl>or.ald of that company.
"We have men coming to us and crying
for work." said Gray yesterday, "among
them many strikers. They say their fam
ilies are crying for food and they must
pet some work to keep their larders full.
We are promised all the protection need
ed for our workmen."
The strikers claim that the charter pro
visions are being- violated by Gray Bros,
by employing: aliens.
Secretary Wisler of the local machinists'
union says that the striking steel and
iron workers who returned to work yes
terday at the Judson mills at Emeryville
did so under an agreement to obtain a 5
per cent increase in wages on August 1.
"The statement has been published,"
eaid Secretary wfsler. "that these men
returned to work because they did not re
ceive a sufficient amount of money from
the strike benefit fund. They were not
entitled to any. When the blacksmiths
and machinists went out on May 20 the
proprietors of the Judson Iron Works
wanted some of these men to take their
places. Each shop requires one or more
blacksmiths or machinists to keep the
tools in repair. The steel workers would
not do this, and as the proprietors of the
works would not give in. the men walked
out. Now they have contracts giving
them more than was originally de
mended."
Sooks for Early Settlement.
Fourth Vice President Wilson of the In
ternational Association of Machinists
says he Is very much encouraged at the
outlook In this city and confidently ex
pects an early settlement of differences.
A compromise has been effected between
the Brewers' Protective Association, rep
resenting the employes, and the members
of- the local brewery workmen's union,
who have demanded an eight-hour work
day, in accordance with the contracts and
agreements heretofore submitted. The
difference between workmen and employ
ers was small. One question was regard-
Ing the time taken from work during
which the men might drink beer. The em
ployers waived this. The elg-ht hours a
day and other demands were granted by
the employers. On the part of the brew
ery workmen it was decided to allow the
employers to discharge such men as they
saw fit and to draw from the eligible list
of union workmen such men as they de
sired to employ Jn the event of any being
discharged. It is expected the contract
will be 6igned at once.
I>onations have been made tÂ«> the San
Francisco Labor Council for the benefit
of the striking machinists by the Sand
Teamsters' Union of $5C and the Long
shore Lumbermen's Union of $100.
The executive committee of the Labor
Council Is preparing- to go before the
Board of Health and ask that measures
be taken to put an end to Butchertown.

RECEIVE THEIR FRIENDS
Tirst Social Venture at the Firm's
Big Store Is a Complete
Success.
The first reception given br the em
ployes of M. Friedman & Co. last night
was a success from every point of view.
The third floor of the firm's extensive es
tablishment, at 223 Post street, was given
up entirely to the dancers, and made an
excellent ballroom. It was elaborately
decorated with flags and bunting, and in
a side room the committee having the af
fair in charge served claret and lemonade.
The grand march was called for 8:30, and
promptly on time the music began. The
march was led by Miss Aggie Kilday and
H. E. Lyons, head bookkeeper, for the
firm. Miss Kilday wore a becoming gown
of some filmy pink material, and looked
very charming. The couples fell in line
after the leaders and the march was both
intricate and beautiful.
The employes of the firm were all pres
ent, of course, and so were the Messrs.
Friedman themselves, and as each em
ploye had the privilege of inviting friends 1
the crowd was both large and select. The
floor, in fact, was filled with merry
dancers and ths fun was kept up until the
small hours. The committees in charge
of the affair were:
Floor managerâ E. T. Lampe. . ' .
Assistant floor manager â M. J. Shlely.

FARMERS DESIRE
L0W WHEAT RATE
V ' ?
A Conference With the
Carriers Takes Place
To-Morrow.
Growers Claim the Freight
Charges Eat Up All
the Profits.
The Sacramento Valley Development
Association will meet in regular session
to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock at the
Palace Hotel and a large number of mem
bers will be present.
The association meets for the purpose
of conferring with the transportation
companies engaged in carrying wheat to
Port Costa and securing from them a re
duction in rates. It is claimed by the
association that the wheat rates have not
been reduced in fifteen years, while the
price of the commodity has steadily de
clined, thus working a hardship on the
farmers.
At' the last meeting of the association
the question was discussed and facts and
figures will be presented at the meeting
to-morrow for the consideration of the
representatives of the carrying compa
nies. â¢
The sentiment of the members of the
association is that unless a material re
duction is made in the rates to Port Coata
the farmers will be compelled to substi
tute grazing for wheat raising to a great
extent, thus reducing the volume of wheat
production.
Many heavy dealers in grain in this
city and some, of the prominent wheat
growers in the northern valleys of the
State are expected to be present at the
meeting and urge that the carriers make
the reduction in rates.
Inquiries made yesterday of gome of the
officials of local commercial bodies and
from grain dealers show that they are
heartily in sympathy with the aims of
the association and will lend moral sup
port to it.
The call for the meeting has been is

- at Night by the Ex

â '-4 .
JACKSAN. July IS.â A few days ago
Chinese commenced a frame building on
the site of the old Chinatown which was
recently wiped out by flre. Much feeling
was aroused and indignation was ex
pressed at the prospect of another China
town in the business section.
Shortly after midnight last night a loud
explosion was heard. The concussion
shook the entire town. Giant powder had
been placed at each corner of the build
ing on the flooring and it was then fired.
Only one stick exploded, but it partially
wrecked the structure.
The act 13 strongly denounced. It is
reported that the Chinese have presented
the -matter to the Consul in San Fran
cisco. No arrests have been made.

Directors Kincaid, .Mark and Denman,
the last named in an undertone, voted In
favor of the resolution, while Casserly,
who had seconded . it, was recorded as
voting no, so O'Connor gets his extension.
Secretary Hansen received a letter from
Mrs. F. S. Baker of 506 South Sixth street.
San Jose, stating that she knew of at
least twenty vacant teacher positions in
various country schools. The salaries av
erage from $50 to $65 per month, and the
trustees of .the schools desire to appoint
the teachers immediately. Mrs. Baker
also filed application to be reinstated in
her position in the school department of
this city. - Her request was taken under
advisement.
"Well, I'll second it to bring it before
the housa," said Casserly, after a little
more silence. . .
Willieboys and other local wearers of
diamonds will be interested in the news
that there has been another advance in
the price of the gems. The sparklers are
now nearly 25 per cent higher than they
were two years ago, and the tendency, ac
cording to the local dealers, is still toward
greater prices. One of the leading dia
mond dealers of the city declared yester
day that there would be profit in buying
from him now Â£.nd selling the same stones
to him a year hence. The Rothschilds,
who control the market, will sell only a
stated number of diamonds, no matter
what the demand may be, and pearls and
rubies have been advanced in price. In
the last fortnight there have been repre
sentatives of several importers of dia
monds in the city, and they have tried to
make it appear that their goods are cheap
to stimulate purchasing by the dealers
but there is no disguising the facts when
the expert views them.
Not long ago an attempt at fraud that
was quickly detected was mado on a
Kearny street store. At the present valu
ations there is large money In getting
hold of the fine stones at what would have
been deemed fair ratings a year ago. One
day there came into the Kearny street
place before alluded to a man who said
he had a supply of fine blue stones to sell.
They looked well and were seemingly a
bargain. The diamond dealer told the
party to come back soon and he would
give him an answer. In the interim the
diamonds were "boiled out," and the re
sult, was that they were discovered to be
the cheapest sort of yellow stonea. No
comment followed the detection of the at
tempted fraud, "but there was no deal.
O'Connor, principal of the Mission High
School and now employed as companion
of a pupil who Is racing around the world
against time, had his leave extended un
til August 22. Mark rather sheepishly in
troduced the resolution on the subject,
and there was a painful silence.
"I hear no second to the resolution"
said President Kincaid.

committee of freeholders that drafted the
charter for San Francisco. By unanimous
vote Mr. Britton was elected president of
the committee of freeholders, and he
steered the child of his brain through
many perilous storms and squalls until it
was accepted by the majority of the vot
ers of the municipality.
Joseph Britton waged a fight against the
Central Pacific Railroad Company when
the company sought to secure Goat Isl
and and when it tried to get an eastern
entrance into San Francisco to the ex
clusion of any other transportation line.
At another tinie he fought the proposition
of the same railroad to secure a right to
a spur track through Golden Gate Park.
No arrangements have been made for
the funeral services, but it is expected -
that the obsequies will be of a semi-public
character.

Superintendent Webster explained that
he had received numerous complaints of
the dereliction mentioned, and he recalled
that the pupils of" the .Spring Valley
School had not been sent up for examina
tion. The board thought that it would be
setting a dangerous precedent to adopt
the resolution, and decided to take it un
der advisement. The board was unable
to find any circular of instructions regard
ing the examinations, and it is thought
that some of the principals misunderstood
them when they were issued at a meet
ing. * â¢ 'Â¦ â¢Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦
Hope for Miss McKenzie.
The information given by Webster will
play an important part in clearing Miss
McKenzie, principal of the Hancock
School, from charges on which ' she has
been tried by rhe board. ; Miss McKenzie
had neglected to send up for examination
the pupils of the eighth grade who had
failed to receive 70 per cent during the
term. The published accounts of the
board's apparent hostile attitude toward
the lady because she had dared to criti
cize the course of study has caused the
members to recede from their positions,
and it is certain that she. will not be dis
ciplined. She made application yesterday
to be transferred to the principalshlp of
the Spring Valley School, and aa she has
apologized .. for her mild strictures It is
highly probable that her- request will be
granted. r \
The board reconsidered Its action of
Wednesday in rescinding the leave of ab
sence heretofore granted â¢ to Miss . K.
Hodgklnson. The lady's sister explained
that: Miss Hod^kinson was really ill when
she applied for her leave, and that her
subsequent marriage in Washington, D.
C, was | an after-consideration. On that
showing the Directors, who do not desire
to be accused of playing favorites, j re
granted I tbTfe leave : to Miss Hodgklnson,
who will not lose her position.
Resolved, That the principals of the Lowell
and Girls' high schools are hereby authorized:
First â To examine all pupils who In tho May-
June examination. 1901, secured an average
record (term and examination status combined)
within 3 per cent of the required standard of
promotion, to wit: 70. per cent, and if said
pupils secure such a standing ih the re-exam
inatlon as shall give them an average of 70
rer cent (term and examination records com
bined) they shall be promoted.
Secondâ To examine all pupils of thla de
partment who because of absence from the
city or illness were absent from the May-June
examinations, and to admit to high schools all
who secured a record of 70 per cent, term, and
examination status combined.
Superintendent Webster caused some
thing of a sensation at yesterday's meet
ing of the Board of Education when he
informed the Directors that the principals
of three grammar schools had failed to
send up the pupils of the eighth grade,
section B, who failed to secure a term
standing of 70 per cent to the High School
entrance examinations. In presenting
the facts of the case Webster introduced
the following resolution with a* view to
ward correcting the oversight:
Webster Informs Board
of Oversight of
Principals. ' Â¦
RE-EXAMINATION
IS PLEADED FOR
AT headquarters of the Republican
Primary League, 930 Market
street, last night there was^a con
ference of league directors with
, . the presidents and secretaries of
the district clubs. Seventeen of the
eighteen Assembly districts were ably
represented at the meeting. The reports
of progress in the enrollment of members
were gratifying in the highest degree. In
the Twenty-ninth District " the League
Club will do up the bosses In good style.
Indications point to an anti-boss victory
In Martin Kelly's strongholdâ the Twenty
eighth District.
The outrageous interference of the Re
publican State Committee In local affairs
has created a widespread feeling of In
dignation among taxpaying citizens. The
intrusion, instead of dampening the ardor
of the league, has inspired the anti-boss
forces with renewed determination to
wrest control of party affairs from the
parasites and taxeaters. Independent
clubs that formerly declined to affiliate
with any central organization are now
falling into line under the standard of the
Republican Primary League. The lines
will be sharply drawn before the day of
the primary election. On one side there
I will be the reputable citizens and tax
payers of San Francisco battling for good
and honest municipal government under.
Republican auspices. On the other siae
will be arrayed the predatory classes, the
rlace hunters, the opium fiends, ex-con
victs, the idle, dissolute and degraded,
who. vote as the bosses direct, as they
have n"o interest in the maintenance of
good government. Â¦
Appeals to Respectable Element.
In order to protect property interests
and defend the honor of San Francisco
the worklngtnen, merchants and manufac
turers will be compelled by the force of
events to rally in every district and cast
the weight of their numbers and influence
against boss rule.
The ballot-boxes cannot be stuffed and
smashed on August 13 next, as they were
last fall, when the rounders and roughs
marshaled by Kelly and Crimmins had
their own creatures in charge of the poll
ing- places. The primary election â¢will be
conducted under the safeguards of law.
Stuffing and repeating, if attempted, will
be promptly checked.
The fact should be recalled to the minds
o-f the people of California that the TT1
den committee, which the Republican
State Committee has been called to recog
nize as the regular organization of the
party in San Francisco, is the product of
fraud â¢ and violence. The Republicans of
the city had no voice in the creation of
the committee. It was appointed by Kelly
and Crimmins to perpetuate boss rule.
There are signs that the session of the
Republican State Committee to be held in
this city to-morrow afternoon will be
lively. While interior representatives of
anti-boss sentiments readily concede that
the Kelly-Crimmins local committee will
be recognized by the State machine, a
vigorous effort will be put forward for a
call of the roll on the proposition. Plain
words may be used by the minority mem
bers in the discussion of the topic. Lead
ing Republicans of the interior take the
ground that the ultimate general engage
ment between the people of the State on
one side and the political bosses and tax
eaters on the other cannot be postponed
indefinitely. The battle may begin to
morrow in San Francisco. . f~ :
Bosses Knew Beforehand. . !
It now transpires that the bosses knew
as a fact several days before the notice
for the meeting was. Issued that the
chairman would call the members to
gether in San Francisco, hence proxies to
be used by the bosses were solicited be
fore the chairman sent out the call for
the meeting. An eminent Republican
from, the south remarked last evening
that the appeal of the boss committee for
a meeting, of the State governing body
was a confession "that the Primary
League would win -out if the State-com
mittee did not interfere.
"Do you suppose,' 'said he, "that tfie
Night.
MADMAN GIVES
JUDGE A "TIP"
?
Mysterious Visitor Meets
Guarded by a Vigilant
Bulldog.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Marin Official at
House of Angellotti Is Now
SAN RAFAEL, July IS.â Superior Judge
F. M. Angellotti had an involuntary meet
ing with a madman last night. That the
Judge is alive to-day is probably due to
the fact that he retained his presence of
mind and by soothing answers and pol
ished conduct turned away the wrath of
his strenuous interviewer.
About 8 o'clock the Judge entered. his
front gate and mounted the steps to his
house. As he put his foot upon the ver
anda he observed a lengthy individual un
coil himself- from a hammock and
straighten upward till he seemed to bear
something of a resemblance to an Egyp
tian obelisk.
"Your Honor," spoke the stranger. In a
firm voice, "I take a great Interest In
Superior Judges." Â¦ â¢ â¢
The stranger accompanied . these words
by thrusting his hands m his trouser
pockets. Such action might well have In
timidated the | most courageous of men,
but his Honor never flinched.
"I assure you. my friend," he said, "that
Superior. Judges. are a proper subject for
people' to become interested in." .
"Yes, oh yes, I have a great interest,"
responded the visitor. "And I have some
ideas, too," of what they should do. In tiie
first place, they should hold court till 4
o'clock In the afternoon; from 4 to 5 they
should study and from 5 to 7 o'clock they
should, eat."
At this point the Judge looked- across
the lawn longingly.
"Fromi 7 o'clock," continued the man,
"until 11 they should devote themselves
to recreation; then retire to an earned
rest. In the morning, while fresh, they
should spend considerable time endeavor-
Ing to reconcile the conflicting decisions
of the Supreme Court.
Now let me see," said the man, as he
thrust his hand toward the Judge's
throat. His Honor stepped back. "I
only wanted to point out, the lecturer
resumed, "that you have a speckled
necktie of many gaudy colors ornament
ing your neck. Bright colors do not be
long to the bench. You will do well here
after to wear a plain tie and a turn-down
collar."
"Now, my good sir, while perfectly
agreeing with you," spoke the Judge, "t
came home to get my overcoat and intend
to call on a sick friend. I am glad to
have met you and shall certainly profit by
the advice you have so kindly given."
The stranger promptly went down the
steps, and as he reached the gate he
yelled: "Judges shouldn't wear bloomers
or live to be over 40 years old. I'll sea
you to-morrow."
After his visitor had gone Judge An
gellotti went downtown to find the strange
individual. He ,was located in a cafe,
but he became suspicious and ran out
the back way and disappeared. Who the
man is no one knows. That he is insane
there Is but little doubt. Judge Angel
lotti says that the fellow made him a
present of enough evidence to warrant
committing him on sight. To-night the
Judge sleeps with a shotgun at the head
of his bed. A sharp-toothed bulldog
sleeps on the front porch.
Marshall Moran, the bartender charged
with stabbing George Blrdsall at the
Chutes last Sunday morning, again ap
peared before Judge Mogan yesterday.
The Judge was informed that Blrdsall was
improving and he continued the case till
to-day. A doctor's certificate will then be
produced and the case will be set for hear
ing.
George Birdsall's Assailant.
Beware of of unscrupulous dealers who refill
Jesse Moore bottles with Inferior goods. â¢
bosses would drag the State committee
into this contest If they were not con
vinced that the Primary League had the
upper hand? Do you suppose the bosses
would appeal for outside assistance if
they had any confidence whatever in their
ability to win out unaided? It Is my
judgment that the Republican Primary
League will be greatly strengthened by
this movement of the boss element. The
agitation resulting from" the interference
will awaken the citizens of San Francisco
to a sense of the danger confronting the
city. There should be a free expression
of sentiment at the meeting next Satur
day. I know that several members of the
committee will speak out plainly if they
can obtain recognition from, the chair
man. The old boss dodge of refusing to
recognize speakers other than those who
are prepared to Bpeak in behalf of the
boss elements may be attempted, but 1 1
do not believe Colonel Stone will lend his
support to such a programme. The fight
in the Republican party between the
boss politicians and the taxpayers may
be on. It is bound to come some time,
and to extend to every county In the
State, and it might as well begin now. In
this proposed interference in San Fran
cisco affairs the State co"himlttee, accord
ing to my notion, has committed a gTlev
ous blunder."
Republican Primary League.
The rooms of the Republican Primary
League, 930 Market street, are thronged
every evening. Citizens assemble there to
exchange views regarding district organ
ization. The rooms of the Kelly-Crim
mins committee are deserted and deso
late. A few place-hunters of a low grade
wander In and out occasionally. The
bosses are practically without control or
district organization and are simply
awaiting State recognition in order to
have something to offer to the indepen
dent district clubs. In the Forty-first
District the bosses have offered to com
promise with the Central Republican
Anti-Boss Club on a basis of giving the
club twelve of the eighteen delegates. If
the independent district clubs are wise
they will spurn all propositions of compro
mise with the bosses, and the hotel tag
enders, because neither faction has
anything to lose and everything to
gain. The Republican Primary League
is the only central organization Â¦ that
represents the anti-boss Republican
sentiment of San Francisco. The
league is not advocating openly or
under cover the cause of any candidate
for office. The league is fairly represent
ative of the good citizenship of San Fran
cisco, and was established under forms
of law for the purpose of creating public
interest in the primary election, to the
end of attaining good municipal govern
ment under Republican auspices. Its ef
forts in this direction should be applauded
and commended by the Republicans of
California. Republican bosses In their des
perate measures to prevent the extension
of league influence are programming with
Democrats. It is expected that Sam
Rainey will line up the Democratic push
to help the Republican bosses. Of course
Democrats cannot be nominated for office
on the Republican ticket, but Republican
candidates acceptable to the Democratic
push may be named by the bosses. Al
ready ex-Assemblyman Flsk Is slated for
nomination for District Attorney. The
Hearst-Rainey combine, It is said, sug
gested Fisk for the District Attorneyshlp.
The motive for this particular deal may
be disclosed when the Democratic conven
tion meets.
Thirty-tWrd District.
There will be a meeting of Thirty-third
District Republicans at Maennerbund
Hall, Twenty-fourth street and Potrero
avenue, this evening.
The State Committee.
The Republican State Committee will
meet at Golden Gate Hall to-morrow aft
ernoon. Many leading Republicans of the
interior, who regard the proposed inter
ference of the State body in municipal
affairs of San Francisco as detrimental
to the Interests of the party, will attend
the session. Several leading- men have
resolved to speak their sentiments freely,
if discussion be permitted.
The attorney will return to Los Angeles
to-day, but. before going he will interview
German Consul Rosenthal to find out if
he will vouch for the Baron. It is gen
erally conceded that Von Polenz is a real
Baron, but it is thought that he has long
overstayed his leave and that he is not
at present in good standing in the Ger- \
man army.
An attorney was dispatched to this city
to verify the Baron's claims and arrived
here "Wednesday. He was authorized by
the Baron to search his trunks, which are
held by the Palace Hotel management as
security for a $100 bill. In these trunks,
the Baron claims, are papers that will es
tablish that he is a real Baron, the son of
a noble sire, and not an impostor. The
attorney saw Colonel Kirkpatrick, who
gave his consent to the searching of the
Baron's trunk. Cashier Clarke of the Pal
ace was instructed to go with the attor
ne" down, into the deepest depths of the
basement and see what the Baron had In
his trunks. After the trunks had been
opened Clarke refused to allow the attor
ney to search for . the precious ' papers.
Clarke said that the Baron's effects Â¦would
more than settle his bill and that was all
he cared about. . . .."
In Los Angeles the Baron was just as
indifferent about his bills aa in this city.
His affairs there are in a bad shape and
his creditors are clamoring. A resident
of Los Angeles holds a patent, however,
which he wishes to sell to the German
Government. Baron von Polenz claims
that he is still in good standing In the
Kaiser's army and that he will place the
patent before the right kind of army peo- 1
pie if he is assisted in this hour of his
financial troubles.
The Baron neglected to either settle his
bill at the hotel before departing or to
notify the management that he was going
to leave the house. He left his trunks
and personal effects in his room, even to
his cavalry saber, with which he had
created havoc among the Boxers, and his
helmet, which was so heavy that it gave
the average civilian a headache to look
at it.
The Baron went to one of the most fash
ionable tailors in town and ordered the
latest things in clothes. About this time
his money was getting scarce. The tailor
made the clothes and the Baron wore
them, but failed to settle for them in full.
A collector was called in by the tailor
and the Baron was put to the humiliation
of being held up in the courtyard of the
Palace for the money. The bill was set
tled and the Baron soon after left for Los
Angeles.
.tsaron von Polenz came rrom cnina a
few months ago and engaged rooms at
tne Paiace. He said he was on his way
to Berlin and that he would remain in this
city for a few days to view the sights.
He visited the racetracks every day for
several weeks and "Plum Pudding John
nie" is credited with saying that "the
j Baron was so easy that it made him blush
to take his money."
It Is easier to get into financial difficul
ties than to get out of them, at least that
will be about the conclusion Baron von
Polenz, who claims to be a German cav
aJry officer, will come to before he has
straightened out his affairs with his
creditors here and at Los Angeles. ; .

Unidentified Man Drowned Wnile
Bathing Between Point Lobos
and Bakers Beach. -
Lrlgi D. Bacigalupi, while walking yes
terday morning along the beach between
Point Lobos Rock and Bakers Beach,
found the nude body of a man floating
in the surf. A few yards away, partly
hidden behind a rock, was the clothing
of the dead man. The body was taken tc
the Morgue, where it will be exhibited for
identification.
The corpse was that of a man about 35
years old, 5 feet 9 Inches in height, with
light hair and complexion, blue eyes and
a pointed chin. The clothing consisted
of a black derby hat, coat, trousers and
vest of brown and black check goods,
black congress gaiters, white linen shirt
and turned-down collar, with plaid tie.
Ar. empty purse, two keys, a comb and
a pair of spectacles were found in the
pockets. There was no name on any of
these articles by which the remains
might be identified. The body had been
in the water less than forty-eight hours.
NUDE BODY IXOATHTG
IN THE OCEAN SUEF
Full of Years â¢ and Honor Joseph Britton Passes to His
Eternal Rest, His Last Thoughts, Being of the Welfare
of the City for Which He Toiled So Unselfishly
JOSEPH BRITTON, distinguished aa
a public-spirited citizen, died last
evening at the ripe age of 76 years
at his residence, 829 Union street.
Death was due to ' a general
.breaking down of the system, but to tha
last Mr. Britton maintained his mental
vigor to a remarkable degree. Though
he was confined to his bed for some
â¢week* he took the liveliest interest In
municipal affairs and each day he would
ask his nephew or one of his nieces to
read to him the latest news.
As the "father of the San Francisco
charter" Joseph Britton will be ever
known to fame, not only In this city but
all over the United States. His unselfish
spirit was shown In his refusal of mar.y
offices tendered to him during his long
residence in this city. He labored for the
welfare of the people and lived to see the
accomplishmnt of one of his most cher
ished plans.
Joseph Britton was born in Yorkshire,
England, in 1S25. He came to the United
States when a lad and the news of tne
discovery of gold in California led him to
Join the Argonauts in 1*49. He Joined the
George Gordon party and sought the El
dorado of the Pacific with other hardy
epirits. The party left New York by
steamer and came to this coast via the
Panama route after a most perilous Jour
ney.
Until 1852 Britton lived in various min
ing, camps and then came to San Fran
cisco. In this city he met J. J. Key and
with him established the firm of Britton
& Rey. lithographic printers. This firm
exists to-day as one of the most stable
business concerns of the Pacific Coast.
Joseph Britton was never married. His
sister married his partner, Rey, a few
years after she came to California to Join
her brother. Mrs. Rey died a few months
ago. Her husband died some years a^o,
and -was succeeded in the firm of Britton
& Rey by his only son, V. J. A. Rey. Mr.
and Mrs. Rey were survived by this son
and three daughters, who watched by the
bedside of Joseph Britton with unceasing
care, until be .was called to his eternal
Test.
When the vigilantes of '49 determined to
rid the new city of the West of the crim
inal element Joseph Britton was a leading
figure axnong the reformers. When A. S.
Hallidle Invented the cable road Joseph
Britton was one of his most earnest sup
porters. With the inventor, James Mof
fitt and Henry L. Davis, Britton built the
Clay-street cable roadâ the first cable road
In the world.
In the early '50' s and in 1S70 Joseph
Brittoa served as a Supervisor of this
city.
For many year$ Mr. Britton devoted his
entire energy to forming the Taxpayers'
party, which r.fterward grew into the
