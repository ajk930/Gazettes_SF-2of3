The decision of - the Supreme Court
handed down. last Saturday, by which the

brought joy and gladness to. the hearts of
the holders of office affected by the ruling
of the appellate court.
Yesterday In places "where men do con
gregate" Â¦ dozens of the county deputies
met and discussed the decision. The feel
ing that their positions were secure was
most . pronounced, and many bumpers
were quaffed to the health of the Justices
of the Supreme Court who had delivered
a body blow at the Ironclad rules of the
charter ..and the merit system.
On the other hand, those Â¦ deputies in
county offices who had secured their po
sitions by reason of c'.vil-service examina
tion were in a state "of tension yesterday,
for the ruling of the Supreme Court gives
the power to the heads of departments to
oust from office the "merit" holders and
place their own friends "In the positions.
"Much speculation was rife yesterday as
to what action might be taken to-day by
the county officers toward their deputies.
Nothing definite could be learned, but
whispered consultations during the Â¦' day
led to statements that "something might

The general opinion was that Mayor
Phelan and the "reform", element were in
the minority and that there would be
room in city jobs for others than members

would receive the appointment. He repre
sented the President at the Queen's jubi
lee in 1897 and he expected to be appointed
embassador to England to succeed Choate.
but that ; gentleman declined the invita
tion to a seat in the Cabinet. Some of
Reid's' friends insist that he is to go into
the Cabinet, succeeding Hay a3 Secretary
of State, but if Hay concludes to remain
Reid will be again sent to London as the
President's special ambassador.
"- Senator Allison has great influence at
the "White House and Carnegie is an old
friend of McKinley. While he was op
posed to the President's policy in the
Philippines and has been one of the most
earnest anti-imperialists, he and the
President have remained personal friends

probably will appoint Carnegie for this
honorary assignment, but he must take

SALT LAKE. April 7.â Vice President
Bancroft of the Oregon Short Line an
nounces to-night that his company will at
once build to Los Ansreles over the sur-
vey made by the Union Pacific. In 1SS9.
Work was begun at Lvada to-day with a
force of 100 men and one mile was com
pleted. v^" f r x^^
The aim is to shut out Senator TV. A.
Clark's road, which naa obtained a title
to the grade below Uvada, Attorney E. O.
"Whittemore of the latter road is at Ploche
to get out an injunction to prevent the
Short Line building on the grade. The
Short* Line has owned the grade slnea
18S3, but never attempted to use It until
the Clark road appeared to be a certainty.
The Short Line's objects the opposition
declares, is to be to check the Clark road
and then do nothing:. .
As projected row, the Short Line pro
poses building from Uvada to a point be
tween Beaumont and Banning, a distance
of 440 mile3, where connection can Â¦ be
made with the Southern Pacific
The important decision of the Register
and Receiver of the Land Office at Car
son in favor of the Los Angeles road and
against the Oregon Short Line In the
matter of the old grade In Lincoln Coun
ty, Nevada, is a very important feature.
Here arises quite a question of railroad
and land lawsâ whether the decision of
the Register and Receiver of the United
States Land Office at Carson is strong
enough to cause a Judge to Issue a re
straining order. Tlie decision will be
taken as prlma facie evidence that the
Utah aa<l; California has & right to .tha
grade, -Wd -*Â© couri Is .expected to
hold. The order, however, would be but
a temporary Injunction pending the ap
peal to. the Commiss'loner of the General
Land Office or higher authority. Such an
order could emanate from a Nevada Dis
trict Court or the United States Court.
Facts point to one conclusion, and that
is that if the Oregon Short Line suc
ceeds in strangling the embryo San Pedro.
Los Angeles and Salt Lake, no line of
railroad will be built from Nevada to an*
all-rail connection with Los Angeles for
some time to come, simply because the
Harriman syndicate would not build a
third line to parallel its three existing
lines to the coast, thus dividing its traf
fic into four parts instead of three. As
long as the Southern Pacific was a friend
ly yet dictating connection of the Union
Pacific, the latter was prevented building
when It wanted to. The Utah and Pacific
was,- to all Intents and purposes, built by
the Union Pacific, but when called to ac
count the line could be pointed out as
an independent company. The Short Line
wanted an Independent company to build
the line, and It is a fact that when the
Clark project was first broached there
were several good reasons for believing
that the Oregon Short Line waa not
averse to the plan..
When the great deal for the purchase
of the Southern Pacific by the Union Pa
cific tvas started the entire situation waa
changed, because a line from Salt Lake
to Los Angeles and San Diego would di
vert traffic from the Ogden-San Francis
co and New "Orleans-Los Angeles routes,
and naturally decrease the earning power
of the Southern Pacific.

ST. LOUIS, April 7. â Sparks from a
switch engine to-day set fire to the big
elevator owned by the St. Louis Elevator
and Storage Company, and within less
than two hours the building was reduced
to ashes, entailing a loss of $650,000. The
building and contents, which consisted of
about 800,000 bushels of wheat and corn,
were fully insured. *
The elevator, which was situated on. the
river front at the foot of Biddle street,
was the second largest in St. Louis and
was used for storage purposes by others
than the members of the St. Louis Storage
Company, but the latter just at this time
happened to own almost all the grain.
The building contained corn and wheat of
grades below No." 2: Only a small amount
of high-class cereals was stored there.
H. C. Haarstick, president of the com
pany, gave it as his opinion that the loss
of the grain would not affect the local
market. Â¦ : ..-â¢Â¦
The building was insured for $90,000 and
the storage company's grain for $550,000.
Other insurance on private storage will
aggregate 550,000. Nearly every insurance
company represented in St. Louis carried
policies on the grain. There will be little

TICKET-OF-LEAVE MAN
CAUSES WIFE'S ARREST
Alleges He Gave Her Large Sums
Ignorant That She Had Ob-
tained Divorce.
CHICAGO, April 7.-Daniel F. Doherty.
an English ticket-of-leave man, who is
well known in gambling resorts of New
Tcrk and London, has caused the arrest
here of his former wife, Mary Doherty,
whom he charges with obtaining money
from him under false pretenses.
Fifteen years ago in London Doherty
shot and killed Colonel George M. Gra
ham of New York, following a dispute
over a poker game that begun on a trans
continental liner and was continued at the
Churchill Club in Piccadilly. Doherty was
sentenced to life imprisonment fend -was
confined until 1S98, when he wa^ released
on a ticket of leave;
Doherty bases his charge against his
former wife upon allegations that she se
cured a divorce fr&m him while he waÂ«: a
prisoner, but withheld the fact Jjpm him
and continued to take money from him
for her maintenance. He alleges that
since she obtained a divorce from him in
Philadelphia, in 1S3S, she has had from
him about $7000. He also states that when
he went to prison he gave her over $15,000.
Mrs. Doherty's friends maintain that the
divorce was not secured until a few
months ago, and that, since being sepa
rated from him she has had no money
from him. .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. April 7.â Major Gen

to repress the murder of innocent Fllt
plnos by American soldiers.
Secretary Root has received from Gen
eral MacArthur a report of a crime of
peculiar atrocity committed by Privates
Edward M. Brodie and James F. Coffey,
of troop C. Third Cavalry. Brodie and
Coffey were tried for murder and se i
tenced to be confined at hard labor for life.
Commenting upon the case, General Mac-
Arthur said:
"The evidence upon record is conclusive
that they. In a spirit of wantonness,
murdered, by shooting, a harmless boy
whom they met on the highway. The
taking of the life of this innocent being
was, under the circumstances, showii
upon the record, a crime of peculia
atrocity that might be viewed with hor
ror by the most debased savage. As sol
diers In the army of the United States,
they should have been helpers and de
fenders of the Innocent. Returning alon<Â»
from a tour of detached duty to the sta
tion of their troop, they, in wantonness,
perpetrated this crime for which any
penalty known to the law is not too great
punishment."

EASTER SUNDAY
IN NEW YORK
NEW YORK, April 7.â Lawyer . Albert
T. Patrick, who is charged with the mur
fier of Millionaire Rice, made a statement
to-day concerning Hh6 case!: He had been
asked to say... something- concerning a
story printed in a morning paper to the
effect that Valet Jones had spent several
hours, /accompanied by a '-policeman at
tached to the District Attorney's office, in
touring the tenderloin district. According
to this story hotels; concert halls and gar
dens and theaters had been visited by the
prisoner and: his- attendant" and dozens of
drinks taken. On this -point Lawyer Pat
rick said: ' ' ;
"I have known that thj3 kind of thing
has been going on for some time. I could
not have sworn that such was the case,
but" I -have heard' from;, various sources
that Jones was;; plentifully supplied with
money, was taken out buggy riding and
was otherwise treated .with kindness and
consideration." .. .' r r v.' s '.Â»
Patrick then went. on to speak of the
Rice murder case. This is the first time
that he has made any- statement since his
arrest. He said : . â¢'
Jones never killed VT. M. Rice. Had he done
so he -never would have testified to it, espe
cially as the District Attorney has promised
him no immunity, nor .-would hla counsel, even,
though provided by Captain Baker, have per
mitted him to do so. His confidence is due to
the fact that TV. M. Rice, at the age of S4,
died of heart failure, as did hla brother. F.
A. Rlc yesterday, at the age of 70, and there
will never be any proof otherwise. The only
crime of which Jones is guilty is that of con
spiring: against the. 1900 will and that of per
jury In the Â¦ present proceedings. His fairy
ato#y 13 the result of a. collaboration with,
James A. Baker; Jones* lawyer. Mr. Battle,
who is hired by Baker, Assistant District At
torney Â» Osborne and Professor Witthaus, the
professional expert, whose report Osborne for
the. last six months has been expecting in a
few days, and who swore* that Rica died of
mercurial poisoning if he did not die of some
thing else. . ... ', - -i
. Details a Conspiracy.
: The' object Of Jones' story Is to have me
I held in prison pending the will litigation. I
have already been in prison six months on the
I forgery charge without even being indicted,
and I do not believe that there is any serious
intention to try me on a criminal charge before
â¢ a Jury- My arrest on a murder Charge and
the desperate attempt to hold me is due en
tirely to my ability and attempt to give bail
upon any less serious charge. The stock in_,
trade of the opposition to the 1900 will is thelr*^
already demonstrated ability to control the
District Attorney's office; that 13 to say, that
portion presided over by Osborne, over which
there seems to be no administrative supervis
ion.
So far the tactics employed against me have
been the giving out by Mr. Osborne continually
of statements known by him to be false, in
order to cause the public to prejudge me guilty.
so as to Justify the false imprisonment and
to prevent a fair trial; the wrongful Imprison
ment of myself and the hounding by detectives
of those who appear, to favor me; the abuse
ot the process of the courts by wrongfully
Bubpenalr.fr. in the name of the court, per
sons to personally appear before him and sub-*
mlt to examinations in his office. . -
- The use of men under the guise of profes
sional handwriting experts to swear that the
signatures of the 1900 will, checks, assign
ments, etc.. are forgeries and the procuring
of false testimony are all in the same line.
Jones swore on the witness stand and Osborne
admitted It in open court that Jones had In
formed Osborne in January that Jones had
killed Mr. Rice with chloroform; and that
subsequently In collaboration. with Wltthaus on
February 21 the present complaint " charging
me with killing Rice with mercurial poi3on
was made at the instance of Osborne in an
attempt to deprive me of all knowledge of the
rature of the accusation against me until he
had used as witnesses those "who are sup
posed to be for me. â Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦â¢:Â¦
- I have been Informed that Jones 'has been
for several weeks past permitted to roam the
streets. So far as I am concerned I have no
objection, provided that Jones be - kept within,
the Jurisdiction of- the court.: .Â».<.; -s-j
Warns His Former Valet.
It would take but little corroboratlon td con
vict Jones upon his own confession, but It
would take a great deal to convict me upon
: Jones' accusation. If I am held or. Indicted
for murder Jones will certainly be also, and I
would surely be acquitted, but In his effort
tD have himself corroborated he mlgrhf be con
: victed, - innocent. Â¦ though - he Is. and then,, .ho
1 would surely be electrocuted. ' for no hand could
cave him.
' Jones Is staking his life upon 'thÂ» ability
1 of the handwriting: experts to d! :red It Rice's
signature, which Jones saw him write, and
which he shows by. his numerous statements
and uncertain testimony that, ha knows Rice
' signed. *' "'.' '.
Jones may rest assured that those for whom
he has outlawed" himself from mankind will
abandon him when they can no longer use
him.
As to my own position, I can only Â«ay that
I will be vindicated and will be able to dis
charge all duties devolving upon, and maintain
all rights belonging' to me. all of which, how
ever, is in the hands of my able and. con
servative attorneys.
Â¦ Of revenge I have no thought, but If I am
convicted of Rice's murder I shall do my ut
most to convict all Implicated. In which event
I am sure I can proves the motive for the
alleged will of 1896 and the- instigators to be
persons striving to uphold it and proving that
Jones did the deed, believing that he could
thu3 prevent the consummation of Mr. Rice's
plans through me. . â¢
District Attorney Phllbln was asked to
day what he knew of Jones' alleged tour
-of -the tenderloin. He replied that he knew
nothing whatever except what he had
read. : â¢ â¢ -
"HavÂ© you at any time given permission
for him to absent himself .from the Houaa
of Detention except when he was In at
tendance at court?" . '
"I have not," he replied. '
" Mr. Osborne said: "I have read the
statement made by Patrick and have*
nothing to say. I cannot make myself pop
ular with the criminal classes and expect
to be maligned at every chance." ,

the health of the Filipinos will not suffer,
because they are acclimated and If they

for them to recover in the Philippines.

Good results have been obtained from thij

it is pointed . out that whether the Su

inference that diplomatic .relations be

Borne of the i Ministers of the powers
begin to think that so large a force aa
21)00 troops acting as legation guards in
the city proper would be a great mistake.
Such a body ,would have to remain in a
space of one â¢ square mile. The troops
could not be allowed outside the legation
quarter armed, and it probably would
not be â¢ safe for them to go un
armed. It is thought by some of the
Ministers that If the encampment were
made from twelve to fifteen miles away,
with the necessary stores, the arrange
ment would be much preferable, as a tel

immediately. ,

Thus Declares the Secretary of the
Better Terms.
WASHINGTON. April 7.â In her official
note to the powers in answer to the de
mands made by the foreign representa
tives in Peking. China earnestly appealed
for better terms. . A copy of the note has
been receivf d by the State Department. It
says in part: ,. 'il : i
We point out that In the Interior of China
local banditti are to be found everywhere, and,
what Is more, they carry firearms and weap
ons of a similar nature, mostly clandestinely
imported from abroad. Unless Chinese sol
diers, told off to hold them in check, are
armed with efficient ' weapons it would be dif
ficult to maintain order; and should these ban
ditti create disturbances and make . trouble
traders and others, Chinese or foreign, can
hardly avoid being Injured thereby. We would
accordingly request 'that some fixed term of
years be agreed upon, at the expiration of
which purchase would be allowed as hereto
fore. Material for â the manufacture of muni
tions of v.ar consists of many kinds, and as
far as those which are indispensable for Gov
ernment use are concerned, the Tsung LI
Tamen ought, on. giving notice in writing, be
permitted to buy them as occasion requires.
As legation guards we would earnestly beg
that a fixed number be decided upon and
minute regulations for keeping them under
control be drawn up, so that they . may not
stir up trouble outside of their own lines.
X preliminary- consultation between the
powers as to how many men of each nation
are to be, employed for keeping open communi
cation, what the total number is to be and
what separate points are to be occupied,
should take place and the result communi
cated to us. Further, the powers should draw
up regulations for keeping the troops under
control, so that no cause for alarm would be
afforded to the Inhabitants of the country'
around. Such troops shall be sent solely â¢ for
the protection of foreign officials and mer
chants ; they will have nothing to do with
Chinese territory and Chinese travelers.
The territorial authorities of China have on
repeated occasions had their responsibility as
regards the protection of foreigners Impressed
upon them by imperial decree. Should any
disturbances break out hereafter, resulting in
loss of foreign life or bodily Injury to foreign
ers, those concerned must, of course, be se
verely dealt with In accordance with law.
In assessing indemnities China's resources
must. In our opinion, be taken Into account,
and a broad' and comprehensive grasp of the
entire situation is imperative. . Either some
extended limit of time must be granted within
which to make . payment, or, after careful re
view of the circumstances, a reduction of the
amount demanded must be considered. China's
annual receipts â¢ and expenditures are well
known to the powers, and the present Indem
nities constitute an -extraordinary' addition to
other liabilities. We therefore venture to ex
press the hope that the nations will give their
consent to the adoption of any measures which
China may bring forward with a view to cre
ating additional revenue, such as lacreaslng
the customs tariff, raising the mining duties
or a universal postal, system, introducing the
stamp duty already in operation in other coun
tries.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
From the Milwaukee News we learn .that the San
Francisco. order is Having- a great vogue in the' East.
It says: "This merry form of hold-up has made
Buffaloes out of nine-tenths of the United States Sen
ate, almost all of the lower house, and worked success
fully on no' less than seven Governors, one of whom,'
Dietrich of Nebraska, paid $20 to learn the .cardinal
principle regarding change. .No less a personage
than Vice . President Roosevelt fell a victim of .the
wiles of a member desirous of getting square, and the
strenuous-lived ' Teddy was ' bunkoed to the extent cf
A certain Colonel Sol Bloom, who is reported to
be authority on the subject in Chicago, is quoted as
giving tins explanation of the order: "The prime
principle of the 'Buffaloes' is never to return anything
given to a member, and all members use their left
hands for everything. For instance, when a member
joins a party of friends, and the crowd adjourns to .1
bar to get liquid refreshments, the one whd holds his
glass in his right hand has . to settle for the drinks.
Should a man give me his watch I cannot give it back
to him, but he may buy it from me by buying refresh
ments for the crowd. In San Francisco, where the
joke started, it was customary to tell a friend you
would initiate him and tell him all the points of the
order for .11. cents. But in that part of the country
pennies are seldom seen, and it is a hundred-to-one
shot he will hand you anything from $5 to $20, ex
pecting to get his change, b\it he doesn't get it. He re
ceives the pleasuteof being with the crowd that help
spend his money. When it is spent he is a full-fledged
'Buffalo/." V^r'-
The Chicago man got into trouble by obtaining
$100 from another citizen of that town by a means
which that other citizen regards as a violation of law
and an offense to "good fellowship. T^he offending
party offered to initiate- the other into the "Order of
Buffaloes" upon the payment of a fee of 11 cents. The
aspirant for membership did not have the exact sum
with him, so he gave up $100 and waited for the
change. Imagine his Chicago expression of pain
when he was told: "The Buffaloes give no change.
You are now buffaloed and authorized to initiate
others." The victim has gone into the courts suing
to recover his money, and there is trouble for the, jolly
Buffalo.'
WE regret to learn from our Eastern exchanges
that a citizen of Chicago has got into trouble
because of a movement which is said to have
had its origin in this city. San Francisco influences
are as a rule so helpful and sweetening to human life
that any exception to the rule, even if it be only an
aberration caused'by individual temperament, is more
or less painful. We present the case of the Chicago
man, therefore, in order that something may be done
to infuse a more temperate spirit into this particular
Californian movement, so that hereafter it will not
hurt anyone whom it may strike, even if he be a
tenderskin as well as a tenderfoot.
A BUFFALO IN TROUBLE.
Witty Bishop Creig-liton.
Once, -when the late Bishop Crelgrhton
was at Tottenham laving the foundation
stone of St. Peter's Church there, he was
asked by a leading local resident how ho
liked the place. "I should. like it better."
said his Lordship, "If some Tottenhamite
had not annexed my umbrella this morn
ing. I don't know whether the experiences
of other prelates are similar to my own,
but it seems to me that a bishop's umbrel
la has a special individuality and is pe
culiarly marked for spoil." This remark;
reminds one of his friends of the im
promptu skit the Bishop Jotted down on
a pad at the. Church Congress In London
In 1899:
The rain. It ralneth every day
.Upon the lust' and unjust feller;
But chiefly on the Just, because *
The unjust takes the Just's umbrella.

King "Edward may not induce Parliament to let

the substance of imperialism even if he fail to get the,
feathers.
On this coast there is little new to report, A heavy
frost in the middle of the week did more or less dam
age to fruit here and there, but this is a regular annual
occurrence. Light raius have freshened the growing
crops and softened the surface of the ground, which
had been hardened by a week or. two of north winds,
ro the crop outlook is again nattering. The down
town merchants report continued, activity An almost
&!1 lines of trade, with collections up to the average
and money in abundant supply at easy rates. There is
an upward tendency in a number of lines, notably
ptovisions. hogs, hops,. wine, wool, prunes, salt, grain
bags and barley. The only important lines showing
dullness and weakness are hides and dried fruits.
The country's bank clearings showed a gain for the
week of 31.3 per cent over the same week in 1900,'
Milwaukee and Omaha being the only ""important
cif'es to show a loss. The failures for the w6ek were
iSS against 182 for the same week last year. The
failures for the first quarter of the year were more
numerous than during the corresponding quarter cf
1900, but the liabilities were $21,532,000 smaller â quite
a difference. The end of the present prosperity is
evidently not yet in sight.
The excitement in Wall street was intense. There
was such a rush to buy and sell that on one day it
was almost impossible to keep track of the momentary
quotations on the Stock Exchange. The presence of
th.. public in the market was more pronounced than
fo<- years. Everybody seemed bent upon buying or
selling, it made little difference which. It was an out
break of speculative fever. Some stocks went up and
others down, but the general tendency was upward.
During the early part of the week offerings of shares
were extremely heavy, but the public took them all
and bid for more. Toward the close, however, the
efflux was so enormous that even" the fevered demand
y. as satisfied, and the market yielded. The principal
factors of strength were increased railroad earnings,
an easy money market, the continued activity in iron
and steel and the infection communicated to the spec
ulative public by rumors of all sorts of gigantic trusts
and combinations meditated by the vast money powers
*The merchandise staples as a rule were much
stronger. The wool market was apparently working
around into better condition, with more buying and
steadier quotations reported, though the improvement
v as not pronounced. Cotton, too, emerged from its
obscurity and scored a slight reaction, though statis
tics are still against the market. Boston reported
tteadily increasing shipments of boots and .shoes,
though the recent declines in hides and leather tend to
ffiford the small manufacturers an opportunity, to cut
prices if they choose. Provisions continued in light
supply and good demand at all points, with advances
reported fcere and there. The outlook for iron and
steel continued brilliant^Most works are still behind
with their orders and Western wholesalers are com
plaining of the tardy deliveries of farming implements.
INDICATIONS OF ANOTHER BOOM
TRADE seemed to expand to the dimensions of a
boom last week. Just what caused the sudden
expansion is not dearly manifest. But along the
whole line of commerce, from the speculative field in
Wall street to the remorest rural parts of the country,
tie quickened impulse was noticeable. Rains over a
lai ge portion of the country disturbed the retail trade
somewhat, but this temporary halt was completely
overshadowed by the enormous gain in business where
the weather had less effect
A discussion now going on concerning the merit
of the plans upon which the new fortifications are
being made has had the effect of bringing about the
publication in the London Chronicle of a report
made by Sir Andrew Clarke in 1884 when he was
holding the position of Inspector General of Fortifi
cations. The report says: "Spanish guns mounted
in extemporized and well concealed batteries near
Algeciras, or still more effectively near Campo, would
practically render Gibraltar useless to us as a coaling
station. *' * * The only course. left to us in the
event of Spanish hostility during a war with another
power woqld be to land men and destroy the guns.
This would involve operations on a considerable scale,
since it. would entail the holding of Spanish territory
so long as it was necessary to maintain the inviola
bility of Gibraltar Bay. Considering the nature of ihe
country, and that our hands might be sufficiently full
elsjpnrhere, such operations would be extremely se
rious. The pamphlet â 'Las Haves de Estrecho'âpub
lished in 1882 by General Dominguez, shows that the
Spaniards are* fully 'alive to the new power which
long range guns have conferred upon them, 'and if
they : fail to adopt the measures which the writer ad
vocates it will be solely on account of economical
considerations.". %%?: ; u
v It is to guard against such possibilities that the new
works have been undertaken. In fact, it is now con
ceded that Gibraltar itself is not a strong fortress for
defense in modern war. Sir Andrew, suggested that an
effort be made to exchange it for Ceuta or to arrange
to get possession of Tangiers. Neither of these sug T
gestions is feasible, So. Great Britain is doing, her
best. to make the big rock as strong and as useful for
naval purposes as an ordinary, harbor would be:. As
a natural fortress Gibraltar is, a back number.
i â * OT? many a year the Rock of Gibraltar, from
I which Great Britain has guarded and dominated
* the entrance to the Mediterranean, has been re
garded as the world's strongest fortress. The name
has, in fact, become synonymous with defensive
strength, and to say that a thing is as strong as Gib
raltar has been virtually the same as asserting it to
be impregnable. It will, therefore, come as a surprise
to many to learn that recent improvements in military
weapons jhave rendered the famous fortress by no
means a secure defense, and the British Government
is at present expending large sums of money and
carrying on extensive works to strengthen it.
WORK- 'AT. GIBRALTAR.
If the two movements attain anything of success
in the East there will be much encouragement for the
earnest "workers who have been striving to provide
school gardens and playgrounds in California. There
is no land on earth where such things are more needed
than here, nor is there anywhere they can be expected
to yield greater benefits. ; California may not attain
to leadership in either r of Â¦Â¦ the two ; movements, but
neither should she be a laggard. in either. . .. -
' A somewhat similar movement is that for providing
playgrounds in the city. That movement appears to
have had its origin in London, where so much is'be
ing done in the way of improving 'the conditions" of
the poor and giving young men and boys an oppor
tunity,to find an outlet for- their energies in healthful
games and sports rather than in loitering: about the
streets at. night, and engaging in hoodlum ourages.'
In fact some of the more ardent advocates of play
grounds are sanguine that by means of them more
can be done to rid London' of toughs and young hood
lums than by all the reform schools and prisons of
the country. : â¢ Â«.
. So strongly has the subject been taken. up! in the
East that in several State Legislatures during the past
winter bills were introduced providing for the estab
lishment of such gardens as ; a part of public school
education. It has-been argued by the more zealous
supporters of the movement that even in large cities
similar courses of instruction and recreation might
be given, since the improved facilities for rapid traiy
sit now make it possible for such gardens to be estab
lished in the suburbs and yet be within easy reach of
the pupils of city schools. \ / â¢
The inspiration of any movement on the Atlantic
Coast comes largely from Europe. It is from France,
Belgium, Holland and Denmark that- ouK. Eastern
Slates are learning the benefits of school gardens. It
is reported that in those countries every rural,or-vil
lage school has its plot of garden ground cultivated
under an educational programme of. study and. of
work. Other countries in Europe are following the
example of those named, and not only Germany and
Austria have been active in the movement, but also
Russia.' ' â¢.Â¦.;â¢!' ; ;-;' â¢ . .} , .,/Â¦Â¦_ y
WITH the return of spring the thoughts of the
people of the Eastern. States have seriously
turned to the question 'of providing school gar
dens in the country and playgrounds for boys and

iu this city and in the State generally toward provid
ing such grounds and gardens, and therefore it will
be of interest to note the progress that is making in
the East. - v :

FRITZ AUGUSTUS HEINZE.
Twelve' years ago there arrived in the
great copper mining camp of . Butte a
young man with but . sufficient funds to
meet his' ordinary living expenses for a
period, of three months. His name was
Fritz Augustus Helnze. . - < .
â¢ Born in Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1871, he took
a course of study in geology and engi
neering at an institution in that city, and
then, at .the age of 18, started for Mon
tana. He- soon found ; employment in
Butte with the. Boston and Montana Cop
per-Mining Company as a civil en
gineer at a modest salary. He was thus
given an early opportunity to test his
theories j regarding veins, apexes and
hanging walls, and, incidentally, to study
the entanglements of ownership due to
old," loose! locations and the wide differ
ence in' the sizes of the various claims,
some of which were acquired by the'r
owners under the laws of 1862, while
others were relocations, and yet otherj
were acquired under the present "law.
To his mind there were great mines yet
unappropriated. He felt also that he
could effect large savings in both mining
and metallurgy over the systems in vogue.
So impressed was he with these opinions
that at the end of a year he went to New
York to organize a company. A year was
consumed in this task, during a portion
of which he served oYi the editorial staff
of the Engineering and Mining Journal of
that city.
. Some of His Successes. ,
Â¦ In 1891 he returned to Montana and be
gan the, erection of a smelter. He ako
leased a "mine and pushed its development
rapidly, accumulating a large quantity of
ore for treatment. Then the owner of the
mine concluded that he was entitled to
better terms for his property than the
contract allowed him, and so instituted
suit for an accounting and an annulment
of the lease, obtaining an injunction
which shut Mown the mine. This appar
ently meant ruin to Heinze, fox in a few
weeks his smelter would be without ore
and his business would be at a standstill.
It seemed probable that his opponent
would soon get possession not only of tho
mine but of the smelter, too. However,
Heinze, undismayed, secured the right to
work the Glengerry mine, a property that
had been in the hands of various persons
and had been abandoned by. each as
worthless.. Heinze went at this new en
terprise with vigor, and within thirty
days was digging out some of the finest
ore in Butte, and in such quantities that
he had to enlarge" his smelting works. Â¦
Then he turned on his enemy in the
courts and routed him, . again securing,
possession of the other mine. Within a
few more months he was able to purchase
the Rams mine for 5400,000, a property
which_he had long desired to own, it being
an extension of the great Anaconda lode.
He developed the Rarus on a large scale,
and it was soon one of the leading pro
ducers of Butte. He has recently refuse!
an offer of $10,000,000 for it.
In 1896, learning of the rich strikes of
copper in the vicinity of Rossland, B. C,
Heinze wÂ£nt thither and secured charters
and land grants and built a railroad and
a smelter. Rossland grew rapidly and the
Canadian Pacific decided to build a branch
line to the town, but Heinze's railroad oc
cupied the only available mountain pass
to the new camp from the north. This
railroad connected the leading mines of
the district with his. smelter. The Cana
dian Pacific, discovering that he had the
situation so Â¦well in hand, purchased both
the railroad and the smelter, and Helnze
left Rossland with a clear profit of $1,000,
000 and 500,000 acres of timber and mineral
land.
H3a Resists a I>an{rerous Attack.
"While Heinze was in Canada two pow
erful mining companies had attacked him
in flank and rear, laying claim to the
Rarus mine and instituting proceedings In
court to recover $720,000 worth of ore
which Heinze bad taken from it. Thus
originated one of the greatest mining
eases known to the history of the West.
Its trial consumed three months in the
United States Court at Helena and result
ed in a sweeping victory for Heinze.
Then Heinze assumed the aggressive
and attacked the company which was his
chief antagonist and which had been
transferred to New York. Helnze assert
ed that the transfer was Illegal and asked
the court to appoint a receiver for the
company -on the ground that a corporation
whose property was situated in Montana
under the statutes of that State could not
be operated from New York. A receiver
was appointed, and thus the $100,000,000
worth of property belonging to the com
pany was taken out of the hands of its
owners. The Supreme Court of the State
affirmed the action of the lower court,
and thus it became necessary to relncor
porate the company in Montana. Helnze
went even further. He contended that the
60,000,000 pounds of copper which the New
York company had . sold at 12 cents a
pound should be restored to the Montana
company. 1 This meant a liability of about
$3,000,000, at the ruling price of copper, for
the directors of the New York company.
Heinze's contentions . were â¢ sustained by
the court, but the matter has been ap
pealed and is now pending before the Su
preme Court. * ; . â¢ .
Becomes a Great Copper Producer.'
In the meantime Helnze had purchased
more valuable property. He paid $100,000
for a half-interest in the Snohomlsh mine
and $100,000 for the Sullivan mine. Then
he instituted suit against his old enemy,
the mining company, for $SOO,000 which he
asserted to be "the value of the ore ex
tracted from .the Sullivan mine through
one of the company's- mines. He also
bought the larger part of the Nipper mine
for $150,000. These and other claims and
fractions of claims he has since developed
until at present he is producing about
3,000,000 pounds of copper a month, or one
seventh of the amount of copper produced
by the Anaconda, the world's greatest
Coppermine. . '^'-iV*-''' :
Retaliating on an Enemy.
Heinze's enmity toward .the company
that had made the chief attack on him
was unrelentirfg. One form of punishment
inflicted upon it was as follows:
He bought a- one-sixth interest in a
mine for $15,000, his enemy owning the
other five-sixths. He then appeared be
fore the court and asked that a judicial
order, which had been made several years
before, for the sale of the mine, be exe
cuted. This was done, despite the protests
of the other part owner. The mine was put
up at auction, a deposit of $25,000 being re
quired. John MacGinniss, Heinze's chief
lieutenant, paid down the sum and "Will
iam Flannasran, ex-auditor of the Ana
conda Company, also deposited the same
amount. It was generally believed that
Flannagan was bidding for Marcus Daly.
As a matter of fact, he had been brought
from Chicago to assist Heinze, who also
caused the manager of a large Canadian
bank to "visit Butte at the same time. The
bank manager stood by MacGinniss and
occasionally nodded in response to a whis
pered question from that bidder. The rep
resentatives of Heinze's enemy knew
nothing of the comedy that was being en
acted, and they bid eagerly for the prop
erty. Heinze' stood by watching the bid
ding, his plan being to induce the enemy
to buy his one-sixth interest at a high fig
ure. To- his amazement the property was
bid up to $601,000. at which price it went
to his enemy, Heinze thus realizing $100,000
on his $15,000 investment.
Resistance to a Copper Trust.
Numerous efforts have been made by his
powerful opponent to Induce Heinze to
abandon Butte. but this he declares he
will never do. He and W. A; Clark are be
lieved to be the only obstacles to th^ form
ation of an international copper trust.
Heinze avers that he will never join such
a combination, but that he will develop
his mines to the fullest extent and become
the greatest copper producer in Montana.
Heinze has purchased claims In the new
copper district near Helena, and is inter
ested also In the new copper district at
Spring Hill, Bozeman. His every effort has
'been crowned with success, and while he
admits that he has an ambition to add
greatly to his enormous wealth, this mas
terful young man declares that every dol
lar coming into his possession must come
honorably.
Helnze is a power in Montana politics.
He is a writer of promise and an excellent
musician. He is unmarried.

WORLD'S NAVAL NEWS
Thus the victory is with the people upon every
point at issue, and the thanks of the public are there
fore due to the, men who had the courage to resist
the exactions of the -.ompany and make the fight fgr
the vindication of the law. Should a similar contro
versy arise in the future, it is to.be hoped it can be
brought to a prompter decision. The people have not"
forgotten how quickly the courts brought to a de
cision the unconstitutionally of the income tax im
posed by the Wilson act; and they have been curious
to know why the validity of all other acts affecting
the people as a whole could not be decided with an
equal promptness. It would seem that law questions
arising from acts of national taxation might be given* 1
the right of way in ill courts so that the practice of
tax shirking could be stopped at once.
Concerning the war tax itself the decision' of the
court upholds the view taken by The Call that it was
the plain intention of Congress that express com
panies and not the public should pay the tax.; Upon
that feature of the 'question the court said: "If a
decision upon this point had been necessary, we enter
tain no doubt that but one conclusion could have been
reached â that this duty is primarily upon the carrie-.
The language of the act seems to foreclose any con
troversy upon the matter."
That declaration of the law is one of which the pub
lic should take due note, for it is hardly likely that it
is in the matter of war^taxes only that'Wells, Fargo
& Co. have made arbitrary exactions upon some ship
pers and not upon others. All such exactions are 1 ille
gal, and if the parties 'imposed upon resent and resist
the wrong, the courts will grant a remedy."
It is to be noted that the decision of the court is
based upon a principle that affects more than the war
tax. It is a decision that express companies cannot
exact from the public, or from a portion of the public,'
anything more than their regular charges.- Referring
to the particular case before it, the court said: "Here
it is true that the exaction is small, amounting to oniy
one cent, but, if the principle is good, it would apply,
eqrally well if the amount were large! Being an arbi
t;j.ry demand of the' company, that is to say, a demand
which it could waive at pleasure, it would mean, if
the principle contende-i by an appellant be upheld,
that one shipper mights receive the services of the
express company upon payment of the regular charge,
while others for the same service would be compelled
to pay varying sums, arbitrarily exacted, in addition to
the regular charge. So stated, and we think the state
men^ a fair one, it will not need discussion to show
that' the principle is em neous, and that this may not
be done. ,Each and every shipper is entitled to the
services of the company upon the payment- of the reg
ular charge for the same service."
It is to be regretted that the slow machinery of the
courts has so long delayed the decision; that the ex
press company has with almost complete .impunity
been permitted to violate the law and profit by illegal
exaction for more .than two years. It is, however,
a consolation to, know that at last the law has been
vindicated and the fact made known that the statutes
cf the country cannot be set aside or be treated with
contempt by corporations.
BY the decision of the Supreme Court on Satur
day, to the effect that Wells, Fargo. & Co. and
other express corporations must pay the war
revenue tax imposed upon express shipments, a not
able victory has been- obtained for the people . over
the tax-shirkers. Every point of, the contention of
The Call against the greed, the partiality and the ille
gality of the tax-shirking*corporations'has been sus
tained. Wells, Fargo & Co. have been violating the
law from the startâ have in fact been virtually ex
torting money from the public. So says the Supreme
THE TAX-SHIRKERS BEATEN.
In all of that there is so much of general satisfaction
that the Chicago mishap' must be regarded as truly
deplorable, and it is to be hoped the case can be
settled out of court. In our sympathy with the Chi
cago victim, however, we must not overlook" the fact
that he is himself much to, blame for the bad habit of
carrying $100 bills around with him" for pocket change.
A man who is guilty of that practice ought to be
taught ' a lesson, and perhaps on the whole the price
he had to pay for it was not too large.

DISMASTED BARK
All Topmasts, Save the Jig
ger, With Everything
. Attached, Gone, i
Disabled Vessel Is Seen Abqut Twd
Thousand Miles Off Shore and j
. Heading for San
Francisco.
- It is many a year since the dismasting
of deep water vessels in the month of
March was of such frequent occurrence in
the Pacific as now. The cases of the Otto
Guildermelster, Willscott and Olympic
are only a few weeks old, and their mis
haps were all. discussed again yesterday,
when the news; came that another dis
masted vessel was off the coast.
The matter was' reported by Captain
Ward of the schooner Rosamond. The
Ottillie Fjord, twenty-four days from
Mahukona, and -the brig. Consuelo, seven
teen days from.Kahului, also arrived, but
neither of ' them saw the vessel, in dis
tress. The memorandum of the Rosamond
is as follows: ,
March 20.â Passed a' four-masted Iron vessel
with the lore, main and mizzen topmasts car
ried away with everything attached. She had
a reef ed . foresail and mainsail, two staysails
and a reefed spanker set. The spankennast
was intact. The wind was easterly and the
vessel was .heading about north by east. She
was about ten miles oft and displayed no sig
nals. , . : '. Â¦ .. . - . -. '
"The passengers who came up on the
Rosamond say the dismasted bark was in
ballast. J Mortimer Stevens of the Ha
waiian Advertiser was a passenger on the
schooner and says the vessel was painted
black and that her > water Une, could be
seen from the deck of the Rosamond. A
good breeze was blowing and the stranger
seemed to be making good headway for
San Francisco. There was one yard left
on the fore, two on the main and one on
the mizzen mast. ' â¢'
When sight'ed by the Rosamond the bark
must have been about 2000 miles off Santa
Barbara. Being in ballast if would look
as if she was from one of the nitrate
ports, but the fleet coming from South
American ports is hardly due and none of
them fit the bill. As the crippled vessel i3
right in the track of shipping the chances
are that some of the fleet bound here from
the islands and Australia will bring in
her name. Â¦ . Â¦ â¢ - .. '
The schooner Mary Etta went to sea
Saturday night, but had to put back
owing to the strong northwest breeze that
was blowing.
The ship John McDonald, now out 203
days from Baltimore for San Francisco,
is considered a poor risk even by the
gamblers, and the underwriters are pay
ing 75 per cent to reinsure their chances.
.An electric launch for use at Catalina
formed part of the steamer Hawaiian's
cargo from New York. It was launched
yesterday, and. when fitted out will go
down the coast under Its own power.

SACRAMENTO. April 7.â H. H. Johnson
shot and instantly killed William Baker
at 8 o'clock to-night in the saloon kept
by Johnson and Rufus E. Derr, at May
hews, a few miles east of Sacramento, on
the road to Folsom.
Baker and a man named William Dolan
had spent the early part of the evening
drinking in Samuel Pugh's saloon at
Perkins, a couple of miles west of May
hews, and it is said were heard to utter
threats that they intended to go to John
son & JDerr's j>Tace at Mayhews and
"clean out" the establishment. It appears
that the grievance of the two men lay in
the fact that last summer Johnson . &:
Derr had brought an attachment suit
against Dolan. The latter and Baker
were fast friends, and when Dolan . re
turned from Wheatland to-day they maOij
common cause of Dolan's troubles and de
nounced the Mayhews saloonkeepers in
strong language.
It is thought that some traveler on the
road to-night brought word to Mayhews
from the scene of the Perkins saloon reve 1
that trouble might be looked for. At any
rate, when Dolan and Baker arrived Â»t
Mayhews, Johnson was ready to receive
Perkins. Deputy Sheriff Hinters, who live?
in the vicinity, placed Johnson under ar
rest. Coroner McMullin has left Sacra
mento to secure the remains of Bakev.

them. Two young men named McDer
mott and" Maxfleld were out In front of
the saloon and Dolan and Baker forth
with engaged them in a quarrel. "While
this disturbance was at its height Baker
and Dolan called upon Derr, who, besides
being part owner in the saloon, is a
deputy constable, to come, out and stop
the row. : It is believed that this move
was a ruse from the start to bring Dei: 1
out of the saloon and leave Johnson . in
there alone to make , the cleaning out
process the easier. As soon as Derr came
out a rush was made for the saloon.
Derr drew a revolver and warned the. in
truders to stand back.. Baker paid no hesd
to him but made in the direction of John
son, who was behind the bar. Â¦ Â¦.
"Stop where you 'are," , cried Johnson,
raising a shotgun, "or I'll shoot."
Baker still moved . . forward, however,
and Johnson discharged the weapon in his
face. The shot severedithe jugular. vein
and caused death. ; , - . *
Neither Dolan nor Baker was prepared
to fulfill their alleged threats, since no

Special Dispatch to The CalL
AM sure no trouble can come to a mod
ern bride after marriage. She has all
her troubles before she marches proud
ly down the center aisle to a Men
delssohn accompaniment.
I don't believe there Is a girl who has
had more responsibilities during the past
few weeks than pretty Charlotte Cun
ningham, who on Wednesday night is to
wed Lieutenant Kessler. Lottie has been
attending to all the details of her wed
ding, and her woes have been trying and
many.
The last serious problem the sweet
young bride-to-be has encountered is
the flowers her bridesmaids are to carry.
First it was decided that they were
to carry roses. Then one fair bridesmaid
discovered that roses were covered with
thorns, and that thorns meant disaster
when maids wore fluffy chiffon dresses.
A substitute for roses had to be found,
and carnations were agreed upon. Now,
this is not the season for carnations, and
no florist, would promise that he could
furnish enough carnations for nine bridal
attendants to carry..
When carnations were out of the ques
tion Easter HMes were mentioned with
favor. The scheme was to have the girls
carry great big bunches pressed "close to
their sides, like sabers. At first some girls
opposed the Easter lily proposition. "Too
much like a funeral," they said. They
were finally made to look with favor upon
the lilies, and then the florist killed the
proposition. "Couldn'.t get enough lilies
after Sunday," he said.
I have no further information on the
question. The last time I saw Charlotte
she knew her attendants were to carry
some flowers, but she was waiting for a

I never saw anything daintier than the
decorations at the dinner given last even

wear.
It was a Dink and white dinner and the
pretty oval table was made beautiful with

BULLET FROM BARTENDER'S PISTOL
KILLS A THREATENING VISITOR
Lyllyn and Mr. Mathias were to have
been married after Easter week; only the
court calendar interfered. The groom,
who is a prominent attorney in Chicago,
had a big case coming up and knew it
could not be disposed of, until long after
the arranged wedding day. So he had an
obliging judge postpone the case three
weeks and hurried out here. When Mr.
Mathias reaches his home In Chicago with
his bride it will be seen that he made the
best of his time. He spent a week in this
I never saw a more simple and impres
sive ceremony than the one which made
sweet Lyllyn Ruggles Mrs. Lee Mathias.
And back of it all there wag that pretty
romance that hurried the wedding day,
and which, I am sure, we all thought of
as we heard the two loving hearts plight
their troth.
The gift that -caused this all-round Joy
was nothing more nor less than a baby
picture of Miss Baxter. Tevis' fiancee
went up to Taber's last week to be pho
tographed, and there learned the delight
ful news that they had a baby picture of
herself, taken when she was about 2 years
old. Miss Baxter carried the picture of
her baby self off in triumph and that
same evening presented it to Hugh Tevis.
The baby picture of Miss Baxter shows
that the fair miss was born a beauty. Her
soft, rounded face, great blue eyes and
marvelous complexion were just the same
when she was learning to walk, with the
aid of a chair, p.s they are now. The soft
blonde down that crowned the baby head
has giveh place to a wealth of golden
hair. Otherwise ' years have neither en
riched nor robbed the beauty in any par
ticular.
Beautiful Cornelia Baxter gave her
fiance her first present the ' other day.
Tevis was more, than delighted with the
remembrance from the fair one whom he
loves best of all, and the prettiest part
of my story is that the present caused
both the happy tfonor and the fortunate
one to whom it was given an equal
amount of pleasure.

VEINS OF GOLD
IN A LOST MINE
Arizona Prospectors Dis
cover a Famous Old
Treasure Field.
Ir. a Shaft Hidden by Bocks and
Shrubbery Flakes of the
Yellow Mital Are
Abundant.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 6.-Hllary Dock-
Bon and Jacob Bush, two prospectors who
went into the Xavajo reservation when it
was cpened to miners two months ago,
have four.d the famous lost mine of Bald
Rock.
Bush reached Holbrook on Monday ana
renewed the stocic of provisions. He and
Dockson, he pays, made no particular ef
fort to locale the traditional treasure
vault, and, in fact, had not believed in its
existence. They were prospecting on the
south eide of the Carriso Mountains, near
the head of the Gothic wash, in the ex
treme southern ?art of the reservation,
when they came upon the entrance to the
ehaft. hidden by large rocks and bushes.
The two men followed the shaft down for
fifty feet and found a series of tunnels
reaching as far in several directions. On
all sidCs of the shaft and tunnels were
streaks of gold-bearing ore, some of it
showing free gold In large flakes.
From all indications no human being:
had been in the mine for years, but many
wild beasts had made their dens there.
The underground workings were foul with
thousands of bats, and snakes had taken
up their abode near the entrance.' It has
uiv.-aya been the belief that the Navajos
obtained a steady supply of goid from the
famous lost mine, but it is likely they
abandoned it when the supply of visible
trt'e gold began to dwindle. It is the
opinion of the discoverers that the mine
will prove fabulously rich and that the
original workings did not reach the best
bodies of ore.
According to general belief the Bald
Rock mine was first operated about forty
five years ago, and it was aoout two years
later when the party owning and working
It was attacked by Indians, who have un
til now persistently refused to allow min
ing in tnelr territory. Oc>e Peterson, the
only member of the party who succeeded
in escaping, told of the tremendous wealth
of the mine, but could never relocate it.
"Pogleg" Smith, the famous owner of
the mythical "Pegleg" mine, was thought
to have got gold from -the. Bald Rock
mine. Smith was known all over the West
in the early days. He had prospected
every range in the Sierra Nevadas, and
often struck it rich. For a lone time he
lived in Southern Utah, and from some
source had obtained a big bag of gold
<lust. His hospitality was known for hun
drfds of miles around, but never to his
best friends would he give up the secret of
his gold. For nearly a year he was in the
Navajo reservation, and it was the gen
eral belief that all his Â¦wealth came from
there. Smith was always able to elude
the watchful Indians, although they suc
oecded in keeping out nearly all pros
pectors.

Sacramento 4, San Francisco 6.
Over at Freeman's Park yesterday
morning the Oakland enthusiasts shouted
at the, Sacramento and San â¢ Francisco
teams in the first game of the season on
the; other side of the bay. Fireman Fitz
turned on the curves for the 'Wasps and
Red Dog Devereaux was on the slab for
the Senators. '
. Devereaux was exceedingly good v f or
a time, no bunching of hits being prac
ticed upon him, but in -the eighth inning
there came a tidal wave of slashings right
i and left. A half dozen hits made Dever
eaux look like half of thirty. cents. Fitz
patrick, elevated in wind by his homt
run performance â over the left field he'
sent the spheroidâ also fell from grace.
In this same inning he was peppered for
three hits, as many runs resulting. The

ELEVEN INNING GAME.
Oakland Defeats Los Angeles by a
LOS ANGELES.
LOS ANGELES, April 7.â In an eleven
inning game to-day Oakland defeated the
home team by a score of two to one.
Oakland's victory was largely due to the
excellent box work of Moskiman. Twelve
local men Â¦were left on bases, the Los

Warne is in Anaconda, having been tak

The fire was discovered by Watchman

he was unconscious, and. Sergeant Wolf
ran and dragged him to a place of safety.
He was sent to the Receiving Hospital for

SAN FRANCISCO.
Sacramento 5, San Francisco 4.
O- UT of the series of five games in
which San Francisco and Sacra
mento have been crossing sticks
during the week past the local
team has taken the odd trick. The
closest of all the. games was that played
yesterday afternoon which ended in a vic
tory for the visitors- by a score of 5-4, a
fitting wind-up to'the season's prelude on
the diamond.
By sure and steady playing- the game
progressed smoothly until the last of the
third inning, when the storm gathered
about the heads, of the local diamond ex
perts. The Senators then fell upon
Whalen for a couple of hits and, with tho
assistance of San Francisco errors, scored
four runs. Devereaux received free trans
portation privileges to the first station
and stole his way to the midway point,
crossing the rubber on an error of Hilde-.
brand, who dropped a fly from Eagan's
bat after a long run. Then Courtney hit
and Hanlon followed with a double.
Pabst, by a glaring error, helped the
bad work along and when the spasm was
over the boy at the bell worked off four
clangs on the quiet Sabbath atmosphere.
The local team scored in the second in
ning and in the fifth raised the enthusi
asm of the bleacher congregation by a-1
dlng two runs to the list. McHale it was
that did it and he did it well. Reilly and
Whalen had worked their way honestly
to third' and second when McHale came
to the batj After two strikes had been
called he swung and landed. Reilly and
Whalen dallied with the rubber. Tho
run that tied the score is a short taleâ :
Hildebrajid a double and Schwartz a
single.
In the eighth the deadlock was spilt
in simple fashion. Hanlon entertained
the "vast concourse'/ by a double turn
and McLaughlin did the very same thing
in pure imitation. Krug and Graham
unloaded another piece of spectacular
fielding in this inning. With the bags
filled and two men entombed Graham
threw to Krug to catch Knell nappinir."
McLaughlin, who was on third, starte 1
to come homeward and -was caught be
tween the plate and the three-quarter
sack. The score: .

AUTOMOBHilSTS .RUN
THROUGH THE PARK
Only a Dozen Chauffeurs Have
Passed the Scrutiny of Park Â«
Engineer.
A large number of chauffeurs gathered
yesterday morning on Van Ness avenue,
and at about 11:30 a start was made, un
der the leadership of S. D. Rogers, pres
ident of the Automoblie Club of Califor
nia. All went well as far as Uncle Tom's
Cabin, but when it was learned that only
these chauffeurs to whom licenses had
been issued by the Park Commissioners
would be permitted to pass through
Golden Gate Park, the party separated.
H. T. McKnight. E. M. Briggs, E. Courtney
Ford and Arthur Inkersley went up Stan
yan street to McAllister, and thence out
to the Casino, where a stay of some
time was made for luncheon. The run to
the cliff was made via the Presidio. At
the Cliff House, where 1 light refreshments
were served in the headquarters of the
Automobile Club, certificates and num
bers were handed out to those who had
already qualified, the numbers being af
fixed to the backs of the seats of the
machines. Those having numbers return
ed by way of Point Lobos avenue to De
visadero street, whence they made their
way to the Waller-street entrance of the
park and took" the south drive to the great
highway, then back through the park to
the Waller-street entrance, and so to the
starting point.
Among thos who were out. In addition
to those already named, were W. H. Tal
bot and wife, E. C. Anthony, F. A. Hyde,
P. F. Rockett and wife, Dr. Kellogg,
George P. Moore, Joseph C. Saxton, A.
C. Barker, J. R. McKay, C. J. Heineman,
E. L. Brayton, W. L. Elliott, W. H. Dem
minc and William Ede.
A few gf the chauffeurs, after re-enter
ing the park, proceeding along the great
highway and home by way of the Dewey*
Boulevard and the Almshouse road.
As the park engineer did not receive the
instructions of the Park Commissioners
until a few days ago, and. did not hold
his first examination of the chauffeurs
and their machines until Friday, . only
about a dozen owners of horseless car
riages have up to the present secured the
licenses entitling them to enter the. park.
The park engineer will be on hand, at the
park lodge at l-p.'m.- to-day to â¢ examine
applicants for licenses.
Came Boy, a For Freedom-llayflower
Puppy, Reaches the Final by
a Clever Bit of
Work.
Sisquoc, th- hound that D. J. Healey
bought back from Jimmie Deane, added
another 'scalp io his belt by winning the
132-dog open stake yesterday at Union
Park.
That the Petaluma leashtnan turned a
good trade when he took Sisquoc back to
his first wigwam Is made plain by his
good showing. Since the last change In
ownership the dog has started in four
events. Three of the stakes were annexed
hy the hardy son of Emin Pasha and the
fourth was lost to him only by his defeat
by 'Warship in the deciding course.
A glance at the scores shows that the
winner was not lacking in determination.
For five rounds not an opponent scored a
point against him. Then in the semi-
TiiiMl Beacon took two points to Sisquoc's
three. "A bit lucky in that go," was the
general comment of even the backers of
the stake winner. The- big blue dog had
the foot o%*er his opponent by at least two
lengths, but ran off the game. Sisquoc
took posscsslon._an<i â¢with two wrenches
and a kill put ah end to a course which
was at least a close_ call.
The most interesting feature of the day
was the phenomenal work of Game Boy,
a For Freedom-Mayflower puppy, who
Â¦was the runner-up in the stake. "War.
Kagle, Brutus, Sir Laurence, Chicago Boy
and Santonin. '.ried and seasoned couser3,
went down before the great youngster.
His showing will be talked of for some
ttme by the gossips. Game Boy is still
eligible in the puppy class. Santonin by
his continued improvement has been a
producer for his owners. An undecided
with llamie Pleasant In the fourth was
his undoing, though he met Fiery Face
in the fifth and after a hard go won on
the short end at 2 to L Game Boy beat
him pointless in the semi final. The Aus
tralian dog, The Chief, was beaten point
less by Log Boy in his lirst course.
The short ends were: Manila beat Dew
drop, Lundin Links beat Olita, Concord
beat Aeneas. Motto beat Lady Clare. Fiery
Face beat Erin at 3 to 1, Flora McDonald
beat Charta, Lawrence beat King Cotton,
Santonin beat Mose, Game Boy beat Bru
tus, Sisquoc Deat Beacon at 5 to 3, Game
Boy beat "War Kagle, Santonin beat Fiery

died on May 24, 1900, the discoverer of the
famous Yellow Aster mine, left 7000 shares
of the mining stock to his three brothers,
5000 shares to his son, Edwin D. Mooers,
and 2650 shares to his widow. Mrs. Mooers
objected to the disposition of the prop
erty according to the will and filed a
contest in which she alleged mental un
soundness, undue influence and fraud ex
ercised by Charles H.. Mooers. She al-
Jeged that her brother-in-law prejudiced
the mind of her husband against her.
In their answer the defendants claimed
that "several years -before his death Mr.
Mooers gave to his wife 10,000 shares of
his mining stock and that she combined
with others : to defraud Frederic M.
Mooers of his property.
-The trial of the case was to have begun
before Judge Shaw next Monday and the
widow came: out from the East several
days â¢ ago to watch her interests.' , Since
her arrival there have been several meet
ings between the contestants and the de
fendants. They have concluded that their
differences were caused largely through
misunderstanding and decided to dismiss
the case. By the terms of the compromise
the. widow abandons her contest of the
will and Charles H. Mooers withdraws his
charges. The estate is valued at $1,000,000.
TRIES TO END HIS LIFE
WITH A RIFLE BULLET
Saloon-Keeper of Blacks May Survive

"â¢'. , â¢ Suicide.
,WOODLAND,,April 7.â W.~C. Burger, a
saloon-keeper, attempted suicide at Blacks
at noon yesterday.. He left a note at the
house of a neighbor, the purport of which
was .that his body would be found cold in
death in one of the'rooms of his residence.
W. H. Black went at once to investigate
and foundone of the rooms with the door
and ; windows, locked" Â«nd the curtains
drawn.' The door > was forced and Burger
was. found lying on the floor. Beside him
was a- rifle.
Burger had put the muzzle of the rifle
under his chin; In touching off the trig
ger the rifle was shifted a little to the left,
and the ball entered near the point of the
jawbone, knocked out several teeth and
passed out close to the cheekbone." He
was very weak from loss of blood, and his
fate is in the balance. His act was due
to domestic troubles, his wife having re

ENGLISH VETERINARIAN WILL
TEST CATTLE FOR CANADA
Animals Coming Via Dominion to
America Must Be Examined.
by Experts.
WASHINGTON, April 7.â As a result of
.negotiations" between Secretary of,'Agri
culture Wilson and the. Canadian Minister
of Agriculture an agreement has been
reached between the two administrations
by which Canada is to have a first-class
veterinarian stationed in England to test
for tuberculosis all British cattle shipped
to this country via Canada. The Cana
dian administration wanted cattle to be
admitted from Canada without tests at
the border by American experts. The de
partment at Washington would not agree
to this.
Secretary Wilson said, however, that if
Canada would send to England an agent
who should have sufficient expert knowl
edge of the subject the United States
would admit cattle upon his certificate
that the cattle had been tested and found
free of tuberculosis. This was agreed to
by the Canadian Minister. It is officially
explained that about 10 per cent of the live
stock in the United States and about 40
per cent in Great Britain have tuberculo
sis. The cattle on the continent of Europe
are so diseased that this Government will
not permit the admission of any animals
from there.
FOREIGN LIVESTOCK BARRED.
British Cattle Only Ones Admitted
Since the Outbreak of Epidemic.
WASHINGTON, April 7.â The officials
of the Agricultural Department are watch
ing closely all reports from abroad regard
ing the extent of the foot and mouth dis
ease, a fatal malady that is raging among
the live stock in almost every country
throughout Europe. For the last three
years the outbreak has been general on
the European continent and the recent re
ports from various foreign ports do not
indicate any dimunition in its extent. This
Government, as it has done since the ep
idemic reached such alarming dimensions,
is refusing- to 'admit any cattle, sheep or
swine except from the British Isle. This
is done not only to "protect the vast live
stock interests of this country, but also to
protect our $30,000,000 or $40,000,000 annual
export trade in cattle. - .

FROST'S HEAVY DAMAGE
IN SHASTA ORCHARDS
Fruit Crop in the Valley Districts Be
lieved to Be Almost a Total
Loss.
REDDING, April 7.â The fruit crop of
the Anderson, Happy Valley and Churn
Creek bottom regions, the three most im
portant fruit districts of the county, will
be an almost total failure this year owing
to the heavy frost cf Friday night. It is
said the almond and apricot crops will be
a total loss. There will be but one-fifth
of a crop of peaches and prunes. Pears,
the great staple of the districts, suffered
the least from the severe weather. It is
computed there will be a loss of but one
third of the crop of that fruit.
The cold snap which created such havoc
was an especially severe one. In the An
derson lowlands ice lay on the ground un
til nearly noon. The districts affected are
almost the sole fruit producers of Shasta
County. The industry represented in them
has become quite an important factor in
the county's wealth-producing agencies,
and Its almost total absence this season
will be severely felt.
PACIFIC GROVE, April 6.â This entire
section is undergoing an extraordinarily
severe cold spell, and fear is entertained
that if the present sharp wind continues
fruit hereabouts will suffer greatly. Frost
the past three nights is ,reported from
Carmel Valley and other fruit-growing
districts. -
I7EVADA COUNTY MINES
PRAISED BY PROFESSOR
Andrew Lawson of the University of

of Observations.
GRASS VALLEY, April 7.â Professor
Andrew C. Lawson of the chair of geology
and mineralogy In the University of Cal
ifornia, who has been here for several
days in charge of the senior .class in the
school of mining of that institution, mak
ing a study bi the mines, has given out
an interview contrasting the mines of
Nevada County with those of the mother
lode.
Â¦ "The mother lode is remarkably linear
in Its extent," said Professor Lawson,
"while in Nevada County there is more
of a network of veins. The former are
larger, but not so rfeh. The problem of
reducing the cost of milling ore to the
very lowest amount does not enter into
the problem in the handling of the ores
of this rich locality. In this region I do
not know of any mines that are of such
low grade as to require such great econ
omy in milling."
Professor Lawson and the class left for
the coast this morning.
BIGS THE GUILXOTINE
THAT ENDS HIS IiTFE
SAN JOSE, April 7.â The body of John
Connelly, a woodchopper. was found In his
cabin in the Santa Cruz mountains ne-ir
Wrights with the head severed from the
body. -The neighbors who found the body
believed that he had been murdered, but
after an investigation and Inquest by. the
Coroner to-day it was decided that it waa
a case of suicide.
Connelly had rigged up a guillotine and
cut off his own head. He swung a fcroad
ax by a rope in such a position that when
he cut a cord the ax would fall across his
neck, which was stretched on a block of
wood conveniently located. The plan
worked effectively, as death was prob
ably instantaneous.
The Coroner's Jury fixed the date of the
suicide about March 27, as the body waa
much decomposed.' and it was about that
time that Connelly was last seen alive. He
was 57 years old and unmarried so far as
known. Little is known of his history. v .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, . N.
TV., WASHINGTON, April 7.â The Call's
news of the rejection by the Cuban con
stitutional convention of the relations In
sisted upon by the United States was re
garded here to-day as the most Important
bearing on the'Cuban situation since Con
gress passed the Platt amendment to the
army bill. In Cabinet circles the special
cable from Havana was eagerly read and
seriously discussed. The discussion led to
the announcement of this dictum by one
cf the President's closest advisers:
"American occupation of Cuba must
continue until terms satisfactory to the
United States have beon agreed to.
"There is nothing for the President to
do," the Cabinet official added, "but to
continue the present military government
cf Cuba. Congress has authorized the
President to withdraw from Cuba and
turn the Government over to the inhab
itants of the island upon the acceptance
by the Cubans of certain conditions. The
President cannot withdraw the military
government until these conditions have
been accepted by Cu%a or until Congress
has modified its directions. There Is no
reason for any excitement, either here or
in Cuba, on account of the failure of the
convention to accept the terms which
Congress prescribed. I have no doubt that
matters can be satisfactorily adjusted
r>Â«>xt winter.
"The action of the Cuban convention is
not altogether unreasonable. It perhaps
would have been better if- the relations
between the United States and the new
Cuban republic could have been adjusted
by negotiations. Congress, however, rath
er than face the probability of an extra
session, anticipated any negotiations by
I>rescribing in advance the conditions un
der which the President should turn over
the government of the island to its peo
pje. This was done in our blunt Anglo-
Faxon way, which the sensitive, excitable
people with whom we are dealing could
not thoroughly understand. This has
grated on the sensitive nature of the
Cubans.
"There is no reason, however, to believe
there will be any difficulty in reaching an
agreement. It is probable that the Cubans
will appoint a commission to come to
Washington and discuss with the repre
sentatives of this Government the future
relations of the two countries. The con
ditions laid down by the Platt amendment
are, in my opinion, wise on the whole.
Their acceptance by the Cubans, I believe,
would have been to their advantage-, as
well as to the' "advantage of the United
States. Yet I will not say that they might
not be modified somewhat without de-
Ftroylng their value. It would be possible
to modify them in a form so as to make
them more acceptable to the Cubans and

SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, March 3Lâ
Governor Allen has within the last month
or so made several trips Into the interior
and across the western end of the 'island.
On his return on each occasion he has
given to the local press optimistic state
ments regarding the condition of crops
and the outlook generally; but hie opti
mism cannot surmount facts.
Hundreds of persons in this fert'le isl
and are actually starving to-day, because
the plar.ters who formerly employed them
have not the small capital necessary to
plant and cultivate crops. The poverty-
Ftricken condition cf the laboring classes
is shown in their willingnes to emigrate.
There are at present on the island immi
gration agents for .three different associa
tionsâone in Hawaii, one In Cuba and
one in Ecuador. None of these flnd it dif
ficult to obtain laborers.
One day last week I was in Guanica In
vestigating cemdittons under which emi
grants sailed for Hawaii. I counted near
ly 900 men,- women and children about to
embark for another land. Seventy-five
per cent of the men were so emaciated
through hunger that it actually tired them
to climb the ship's ladder. The majority
of them had only the clothes on their
backs and absolutely no household be
longings. The children were mostly
naked.
The emigrants to Hawaii are, beyond
denial, well treated At this end of their
journey. Those who went to Cuba are
â¢well provided for. But 2000 who have
Fignod to go to Ecuador are being urged
to break their contracts, and English
emigrants who went from Jamaica are be
ing held up as examples to them.
While it may be a good thing for the
laborers to emigrate, yet agriculturists
are becoming alarmed and are calling for
Government interference. The island press
is unitecfln opposing extended emigration.
The work of the Porto Rican Commis
sion eent to Washington to protest against
the Hollander tax law is already bearing
fruit here. The law is being enforced as
leniently as possible. Property-owners are
being asked to make their own valuations.
While there has been a pretense of ap
pointing assessors, yet Instructions seem
to have been received from Washington
not to allow any political animosity to in
fluence assessments. < .

VANCOUVER, B. C, April 7.â The
steamer City of Seattle arrived late to
night from Skaguay. .Her seven Dawson
passengers report the trail still fair, but
the Ice was broken in several places and
early opening of navigation is expected.
Several deaths have occurred recently in
Dawson from pneumonia. Frank Belcher,
owner of No. 3S above Bonanza, died ten
days ago. He became sick Monday and
died Thursday. United States Consul J.
C McCook had been sick of pneumonia
for several days and. was not expected to
live, according to R.' Nixon of Seattle,
who is on his way to inform the relativca
of Michael Quette of Seattle of his death,
also from pneumonia. Quette had arrived
in from' the outside only four day3 before
his death.
The last passenger stages were to leave
White Horse and Dawson simultaneously
on Saturday, so that until navigation
opens travel will be light.
Dawson gambling houses were closed
from Saturday night until Monday morn
ing, but are now running wide open. The
official statement is that they will be al
lowed to run until June 1.
A renewal of the old-time mining excite
ment has been caused by a strike made
on No. 3 above El Dorado, owned by Hal
stead and Mills. The bedrock there was
rotten and a new bedrock was found
twelve feet deeper. This, held a gold
gravel that is turning out as high as $13
to the pan.
On Tuesday a slide occurred on tns
White Pass line, which knocked the
snowplow off the track, but did no fur
ther damage. The . line was clear n:i
Wednesday. Twenty-seven sacks of ma'l
from the interior from as far as Teller
and Port Clarence, arrived at Skaguay
Tuesday. The carrier left Teller City
January 9, and Nome on the 15th.

BOISE. Idaho, Aoril 7.â One of the most
diabolical crimes in the history of this
State has come to light at Payette. It
has developed that the nine-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Hull,
who live there, was assaulted and then
murdered to conceal the fromer crime or
died from the effects of the attack made
upon her. The crime was committed at
Baker City, Or., last July. Although the
police authorities have been at work on
the case the facts have not been published
before. The people of Payette are aroused
over the matter.
The girl. Delia Fay Hull, went to visit
at Baker City, accompanying 1 some friends
who had been visiting at her home. She
stopped at a boarding-house at the Virtue
mine, near Baker City. At the end of
two weeks the girl's mother wrote from
Payette, asking- her to come home. Mrs.
Jacks, who conducted the boarding-house,
answered the letter, saying that the girl
was having a good time and would be
home soon. Other letters to the girl were
also answered by Mrs. Jacks, all stating
that the grfrl would be sent .home soon.
Then like a thunderclap came a telegram,
signed R. H. Butler, saying: "Come im
mediately; your daughter, Fay, is dying."
It has since been learned that the girl was
dead when the telegram was sent. . . : â.
Mrs. Hull -went to Baker City at once,
and was told on her arrival, that her
daughter was dead. It was stated she
had died from diphtheria, although the
mother had never been advised of any ill
ness. The mother' was not allowed to
handle the body, which had been em
balmed. A physician's certificate declared
that the girl had died from diphtheria.
Butler, who told Mrs. Hull he was fore
man at the Virtue mine, and Mrs. Jack3
accompanied the body and Mrs. Hull
home.
Butler never left the unopened casket
until it was lowered into the grave. He
returned to Baker City, after paying all
the expenses of preparing: the body for
burial and. its transportation to Payette.
His actions aroused the suspicions of Dr.
A. T. Kimmell, who, with Dr. Ira R.
Woodward, local doctors, exhumed the
body. They found absolutely.no evidence
that the girl had died from diphtheria, but
they did flnd unmistakable proof that
she had been assaulted. The result of the
autopsy was laid before District Attorney
White at Baker City, who has not as yet
called it to the attention of the Grand
Jury. The matter was effectually hushed
up until investigated ox the instance of the
Boise Statesman.
The girl, though only in her tenth year,
Â¦was a handsome child and' large for her
age.
The name of a prominent mining man
and others will be called to the attention
of the authorities, as steps are being
taken in this Stata to force a thorough
official investigation in Oregon. The the
ory of the Idaho officers is that Butler
had nothing- to do with the crime, but
has full knowledge of the facts, and was
merely employed to shield the real cul
prit.

SACRAMENTO. April 7.â The Sacra
mento Street Fair and Trades Carnival
will open ilay 6 and continue to May 11.
Contracts have been let for the erection
of triumphal arches and a throne for the
May queen, and for pillars, to be placed
twenty feet apart, on the streets sur
rounding Capitol Park to support many
thousands of colored electric lights strung
in festoons across the thoroughfares. The
Midway, which will run directly through
Capitol Park on Thirteenth street, will
afford scores of attractions, not a few of
which will come here directly from the
East. Altogether the street fair this year
will be conducted on a scale of magnifi
cence not approached by the Initial ven
ture last year, although the latter won
for the capital city the praise of the en
tire Pacific Coast.
A unique incident of the street fair is
the inauguration in the various towns of
Northern California of local contests for
the selection of maids of honor. The
choice of the May queen will be entirely
local to Sacramento, and the voting la go
ing on with a fervor promising a rich re
ward in nickels. But instead of the selec
tion of her suite being left to the May
queen, the street fair committee has de
cided to show 5ts appreciation of the sup
port rendered It by surrounding commu
nities by allowing them representation on
the great white throne. Therefore Nevada
City, Grass Valley, Auburn. "Woodland.
Redding. Stockton, Placerville and sev
eral other cities and towns will each send
one of its prettiest girls to vie with the
beauties of Sacramento- and to show to
the thousands of visitors who are expect
ed during carnival week that Northern
California can produce rare types of wom
anly lqveliness as well" as* choice fruits
and flowers.
That the street fair committee is not In
spired by a selfish motive is proved by the
circumstance that each town has been
told to use every cent realized from, the
maid of honor contest in the purchase of
a suitable wardrobe for the fortunate
winner. The street fair committee will
house and entertain the maids of honor,
and they will take a leading: part In the
great floral pageant of May 8, in the court
ball and in all the brilliant functions of
the week.
In response to the unanimous request at
the street fair committee and of the com
mittees from the three local parlors of the
Native Daughters of the Golden West
having the event in charge, Secretary of
State Charles F. Curry ha3 Agreed to act
as grand marshal of the floral parade.
Several hundreds of dollars will be offered
as prizes for turnouts in this pageant .
and it promises to present a display of
floral wealth such as has never been seen
in the past, either in Sacramento or else
where.

The bay schooner Katie S took on board
178 tons of coal last Saturday and went
alongside the fhip Occidental in order to
be ready to begin discharging . to-day.
Captain Nels Schou and all hands went
ashore as soon as the schooner was made
fast. During the night it began to blow
and a swell came up, which broke over
the Katie S and soon flooded her so that
she sank. When the crew got down to the
front Â¦ yesterday the schooner was at the
bottom of the bay. The wrecking schoon
er Catalina was hired to raise the Katie
S, but had not succeeded last night. The
cargo of coal will have to be taken out of
her before the hull can be raised. A diver
was sent down yesterday morning, and
he says that the schooner is not damaged
to any extent. Â¦ . }

Burglars entered the residence of I.
Sampler, a cigar merchant, at 625 Octavia
street Friday afternoon' and carried away
valuaoles to the extent of $600. The thieves
were evidently frightened away before
they had a chance to search the . entire
house, and overlooked gold and eilver
plate valued at $2000.
Mrs. Sampler left her residence about 2
o'clock In the afternoon to call on a
neighbor. She returned in a short time
and found that the bureau drawers in one
of the rooms had been ransacked and a
jewel box taken.
In the box were two ladies' jeweled
watches, two chains, two pair of diamond
studded bracelets, four diamond rings and
five Dins set with valuable stones.
Just before makins the call Mrs. Sam
pler had laid her plateware from the side
board on the dinins-room table, prepara
tory to cleaning it. When the detectives
visited the premises they expressed the
opinion that the lady's sudden reappear
ance caused the thieves to make their es
cape before they entered the dining-room.

The police are firmly convinced that
Chin See, the Chinaman who was found
dead at 1024 Stockton street Saturday
night, did not commit suicide, but \ was
foully murdered. Two highbinders who
were seen leaving the place shortly after
the body was discovered are suspected; of
having committed the crime, and Detect
ive Edward Gibson, who Is working on the
case, expects to arrest them to-day.
The dead man was known as one of the
most peaceable residents of the Chinese
quarter. A short time ago he signed -a
contract to work at a cannery in , Alaska
and was given the usual' advance money.
It being suspected that he Intended to vio
late the contract and not go to Alaska,
two notorious highbinders were sent to
round him up. They met him on Dupont
stree* Saturday afternoon and asked him
for the advance money.
See refused to give up. the coin, where
upon one of the highbinders struck him
with some blunt instrument, knocking
him down. After he regained, his feet
they told him that unless he returned the
amount he would be killed.
' . See hunted up a policeman and told him
of the threat, and was advised to go to his
home and pay no attention to the men. .
From the investigation made by the po
lice it appears that the unfortunate China
man could not have been in his room
more than a short time when his assail
ants entered and, failing to force him to
give up the amount advanced by the can
nery people, strangled him to death.
The rosition of the body when it was
discovered shows conclusively, according
to," the police and the Morgue deputies,
that the Chinaman did not commit sui
cide. The rope which was around his neck
did not touch the flesh, it presumably hav
ing been loosened after the stranglers
had completed their work.

Henri Dallemagne, the newly appointed
Consul General of France for this port,
arrived in this city with his wife on the
Coast Line yesterday morning and regis
tered at the Palace. M. Dallemagne came
from New Orleans, where for tae last year
he has occupied the post of Consul Gen
eral for the French Government. He re
tired to his apartments immediately upon
his arrival and denied himself to all call
ers. He will assume the duties of his of
fice to-morrow morning and contemplates
no changes in his official staff..
1.1/ Dallemagne began his diplomatic
career as head secretary of the Minister
cf Foreign Affairs in 18g8. He was after
ward successively Consul at Ahlon. Bel
gium and at Bosna Serai, and upon his ap
pointment as Consul General was assigned
to New Orleans. During his .tenure of
office in the Crescent City he had in hand
some important diplomatic matters, that
city having a large French population.
His assignment to San Francisco was
made in February of this year. Among
the distinctions which he bears is that of
a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.
â¢The Consulate in this city has been filled
by Baron Houssin de Saint Laurent, the
Consul at Vancouver, ever since the de
parture for Liverpool of M. Alphonse de
Trobriand, who succeeded M. de Lalande
in November. 1898. Baron Laurent has had
a varied experience in French consular af
fairs. He was an attache of legations at
London and Athens, secretary in the con
sulates at i Chicago, San Francisco and
New York, and vice consul at Quebec. Af
ter belns made Consul he served at San
Sebastian. Spain; Philadelphia and Van
couver. When M. Dallemagne assumes his
new post the Baron will return to Van
couver. .

. One of the '. strangest features of this
case is the' fact that the* detectives of
Scotland -Yard . have known that Adam
Worth stole the picture from William Ag
new & Â¦ Sons. They knew . it, but they
could not prove it. * Thus there Â¦will be no
surprise to them .when they learn that he
has at last disposed of = the canvas. .
â¢ : . v hen shrewd lawyers obtained the re
lease ; of the â¢ man . in trouble in ; France
Worth . retained possession of the paint
ing, expecting, that he would.be able, to
return it to its owner, receiving In return
a big reward- His expectations have been
realized after twenty-five years. Worth
returned -to England' and, having fallen
heir. -to . a few hundred . pounds, Â¦ settled
down, determined to live an honest life.
Worth was always a man of quick wit,
and devised the scheme of obtaining pos
session of the famous Gainsborough,
which was then. on exhibition, In the hope
that William Agnew would go bail for one
of the band arrested in Paris, If by so do
ing he could get his picture back. Susko

hoisted Worth upon his shoulders and
helped him through the window, that had
been left unfastened by a careless clerk.
Worth was smaii quick and wiry. - He
was In Â¦ the â¢ room less- than five . minutes,
but that was long enough to enable him
to cut the Gainsborough masterpiece from
its frame. . â¢
After having had the famous painting
under his control for . twenty-five years,
lacking two ' months, Adam Worth, on
March 26 of this Â¦: year returned it to C.
MonandAgnew. The .transfer was made
in the Auditorium Hotel in Chicago, the
details, having been arranged by the two
principals, who dealt through Detective
Pinkerton and Patrick Sheedy, a gambler.
NEW YORK, April 7.â The police say
the man who took the Gainsborough pic
ture is Adam .Worth. Time, however, has
outlawed the crime, and though Worth is
well known to the Scotland Yard author
ities and to the police of this country he
has no fear of prosecution. .' '
From Its Frame Safe From

Thief Who Cut the 'Costly Canvas
ADAM WOBTH IS THE MAN
WHO STOLE THE PICTURE
Â¦Later, while on a trip to Europe, Lees
stopped over in Cincinnati to give testi
mony against the same gang of forgers,
which resulted in their conviction. He has
followed their movements ever since, and
unhesitatingly declares that the reason
for the stealing of the picture was soon
made known to every detective in the
country, and that while its location might
have- been known -years ago there were
reasons why it was not secured. The
mystery regarding Its location and the de
lay of the owners in reclaiming it are
shrouded In as much mystery as the iden
tity of the man for whose release it was
stolen.
Â¦Former Superintendent C. E. Vannetta
of the local Pinkerton agency, who was
in the field while the early search for the
picture was being conducted and who is
conversant with Becker's - history, says
that he doubts if the latter had anything
to do with the theft of the picture. To
the best of his recollection he says that
Becker was in prison at that time. He
also took a hand in the search for the
picture.
Confinement Is wearing on Becker and
he is anxious to turn his talents into a
larger field than is afforded in the re
stricted confines of San Quentin. He lias
yet some years to serve, but has seriously
been considering the advisability of ap
plying for a parole. , To some one he has
confided this intention, and to a betrayal
of this confidence he lays the foundation
of the story that he was interested in the
theft of the picture. He has served about
one-half of his term of seven years, and
as â¢ the Bankers' Association, for i whose
benefit } the Pinkertons . prosecuted him,
keeps an eye on his movements it is not
considered probable that the Prison Di
rectors would grant him a parole. â¢
Of the gang of forgers who were con
cerned in the theft of the picture but few
are left. Ivan or John Siskovitch, better
known as John Grande through his moth
er's matrimonial vagaries,' was arrested
and convicted through the instrumentality
of Lees. His mother was first married to
Siskovitch, by whom she had four chil
dren, all of whom turned out badly. ,Later
she married Grande, moved, to San Jose
and then resumed marital relations with
Siskovitch. She and -one or two of her
sons are living in the southern part of the
State.
One of the Siskovitch brothers was con
cerned with the Brotherton brothers In
the forgery on Hickox & Spear, in which
some $14,000 was obtained, and. also in the
Wood & Cheeseman forgery in the Bank
of California, where a lesser amount was
secured. In unearthing these forgeries
former Chief of Police Lees played an im
portant part.
Becker 3>esires a Parole.
CHICAGO, April 7, 190Lâ Becker does not
know all the circumstances or would not say
the original picture had not been recovered.
The identification made in this city was per
fect. There is no possible doubt ot a mistake.
During the years Becker has been In confine
ment he has had no chance to have any
knowledge of this picture and he never did
know its whereabouts. He never had any in
terest in it further than the theft being com
mitted for the purpose of furnishing bonds for
one of Becker's gang then In custody. He
was not actively connected in the theft of the
picture. The original Picture has been re
stored to its owners. W. A. PINKERTON.
That the original picture has been re
stored there is not the . slightest doubt,
and some one has reaped a rich reward
after many years of patient search. A
special dispatch to The Call sets all doubts
at rest. It reads as follows:
Pinkertons Substantiate Story.
Former Chief of Police Lees and Cap
tain of Detectives Seymour, who were in
terested in the apprehension and convic
tion of the Becker-Creegan-Deane band
of forgers, know much about the history
of the case. Lees was instrumental in
bringing the "forgers to justice, and rem
nants of the same bÂ£i.nd of men who ter
rorized the banking institutions of Eu
rope, committed murder, forgery and les
ser crimes,- finally paid the penalties of
the law in this State. The last of them
is Carl Becker, known as the prince of for
gers. Another is Ivan or John Suskovitch.
alias " Grande, who died while serving a
sentence of twelve years in the same
prison in which Becker is now confined.
As to the participation of Becker in the
crime of stealing the portrait, those most
ly concerned In his apprehension are
doubtful. It is probable that he was in
jail in Constantinople irnen the other
members of the ban.i of forgers murdered
Mrs. Chapman wife of one of their num
ber, in London." Efforts to trace his move
ments at that time liave so far been
futile, although all the energies of the
Pinkerton agencies were concentrated In
the effort. -
A peculiar local interest attaches to the
recovery of the celebrated Gainsborough
portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire,
concerned in the stealing of which was
Carl Becker, now serving a term in San
Quentin prison for participating a few
years ago in a- forgery, of which the Ne
vada Bank was the victim. It was to re
lieve the pressing necessities of the gang,
of .which he was a leader, that the pic
ture, now restored or in process of tran
sit to its owners, was tstolen.

Dr. Walter B. Coffey. chief surgeon of
the Southern Pacific Hospital, corner of
Fourteenth and Mission streets, had an
exciting adventure with footpads while ou
his way home. Saturday night.
He left the hospital at 12:30 o'clock ani
proceeded up Mission street toward Six
teenth, where he was going to attend a
case before going to his home at 11S2
Valencia. As he neared the corner of
Fifteenth two men started diagonally
across the street in his direction. They
approached him silently from behind be
fore he turned and saw one of them with
his hand in the air apparently about to
6trtke him. The man grasped something,
but whether it was a sandbag or a re
volver or some other weapon, Dr. Coffey
did not see.
The doctor was carrying a light cane
and when he saw the two men he turn-; 1
just as one warned the other off. The
man who had attempted to strike came
on, however, and Dr. Coffey kept him off
only by swinging his cane in front of
him.
Matters were at this critical point when
three or four young men were heard com
ing down Fifteenth street. The doctor's
assailants took to their heels and, run
ning up Fifteenth street, turned up e lite'e
thoroughfare called Julian street.
Dr. Coffey sought a special officer anJ
told him of the attempted assault and
then Informed the Seventeenth-street po
lice station. Several policemen Â¦were sent
out after the two footpads and six or
eight men who could not clearly explain
their presence on the streets at that i;our
were locked up on charges of drunken
ness or vagrancy. They were held unt'l
I>r. Coffex could pet a look at them, but
he failed to Identify any of them as the
nien who had waylaid, him. He says it
was Quite dark where he met the two
men and anyway it all happened so
quickly that he had no time to do any
more than note that thÂ§y were roughly
dressed.
The doctor had $30 with him, besides
a watch and a diamond pin and some
small jewelry.
Dr. 6. E. Whltcomb. a dentist, reported
to the police yesterday that his offices, on
the corner of Third and Howard streets,
had been ransacked Saturday night and
some of his valuable instruments stolen.
