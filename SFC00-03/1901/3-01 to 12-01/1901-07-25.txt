Engagements and Carried About
VIENNA. July 24.â Albanian Insurgents
and Turkish regulars have had several
encounters on the Turkish. frontier. Many
have been killed and wounded on both
sides. It is reported that the Albanians
cut off the heads of their prisoners and
triumphantly carried them on poles
through Albanian towns. It is also re
ported that the Turks massacred their
prisoners.
T,he Albanian revolutionary committed
has called a congress of Albanian dele
gates to Dulelgno in Montenegro to decide
as to future action. A band of marauding
Bulgarfar.s near Ghevgheli, intrenched In
a* farmhouse, were stormed by Turkish
troops and killed to a man.

LONDON, July 23.â "Rev. Mr. Todd, an
American clergyman.' was robbed of Â£1000
while on the Paris-Geneva express." says
a dispatch from Geneva to the (Daily Mail.
"He is one -of the numerous victims of
two fashionably dressed women and two
preventable men."
\ There have been only two prior In
stances In the navy where officers of high
rank were court-martialed, charged with
cowardice. Th^ first was that of Captain
James : Barron, Â¦ whose ship, the Chesa
peake, was captured March 16,'lS07, by the
British frigate Â¦â¢ Leopard. Barron was
charged with cowardice, found guilty and
sentenced 1 to suspension for. live years.
.' Since thÂ» close of the Spanish-American
war a. multitude of histories have been
written chronicling the events of that
brief but .'interesting episode., .They are
all' more or less glorifying: Sampson and
'belittling "Schley,- but* the 'latest attempt
at^nayal history, that of. Edgar 8. Maclay,
Is so decidedly biased ~ and abusive of
Schley, as to Indicate beyond a doubt that
tho ;'real. historians are the partisans of
Sampson : nnd that the. alleged compiler
and writer was simply hired at Govern
ment expense to. further the Interests of
a cllfjue. This hired historian charges
Schley with cowardice nnd fnlsehood, and,
strangely enough, has nothing' but praise
for all tho othrr officers. Maclny was for
some yours In tho services of thn Usht
houso Department .ijÂ» keeper at V>l<l Field
Point, New York, drawing n weekly sal
ary of $10. It was thoro thnt he completed
for publication tho tlrst. two volumes of a
history of the. United States navy up to
ISM. The wnr with Spain necessitated an
tulilltlxnnl volume, nnd tho compiler was
given a plnco In tho Nrw Vork Navy
Yrrd, with the rating ns special laborer,
nt the munlllccnt per diem pay of J2S0.
It !s a rivttng the giving of which Is sub
ject to the approval of the Secretary of
the Navy- or. nny of the bureau chiefs.
This ambitious but careless historian al
leges that proofs of his books were sub
mitted to the officers that related to them
personally. The preface'' la dated New
York Navy. Yard, April last, the very time
when Schley was on his way back to this
country, and a delay In the publication of
one -month would, have enabled the his
torian to submit proofs of matter relating
to Schley to the person most Interested,
and rio doubt some modifications In the
severity of judgment . and considerably
less vituperation would have been printed.
The proof has not been established that
Schley was a coward and liar, but it has
been pretty conclusively proVed that these
charges hold good against the clique that
hired a person at Government expense to
malign a brother officer and take undue
advantage of his absence. .Naval officers
have complained over the baiting to which
they have frequently been subjected in
the public press, but no newspaper criti
cism ever . approximated the abuse and
serious charges made by this, cabal of
naval officers against a member of the
service. The most effectual way of put
ting a stop to this degrading practice of
vilifying a defenseless officer is for Con
gress to Investigate the matter thoroughly
and Impartially; to punish Schley If the
charges hold good or to acquit him. His
powerful enemies In Washington make It
impossible for him ,to obtain a fair trial
by his brother officers. It Is also essential
that the Navy Department should enforce
the regulations prescribing the conduct
of officers toward one another and impose
the penalty, of dismissal for acts such as
Chadwlck was guilty of two years ago. The
charge, that Secretary Long is prejudiced
against Admiral _, Schley la, no doubt,
groundless, but It la evident that he per
mits grave' offenses against good disci
pline to be committed.

of the two officers. Â¦
tion, However, Has Precedents.
The Internecine war between the Samp

been In progress for over three years. It
Is without a parallel In our naval history.
Its nearest approach . being: that of -the
Dccatur-Barron feud, beginning in 1807
and terminating in 1820. Then, as now,
meddlesome friends and partisans were
largely responsible for the trouble, and as
dueling Is no longer permitted it Is most
likely that this scandalous affair will con-

"The whole business is inspired by mal

Continued on Page Four.
According to advices from Nome, that
live Alaskan mining town is shaken to its
foundations by new phases of the receiv
ership scandals. Judge Noyes and his
friends h,ave concentrated their energies
in an effort to oust George V. Borch
eenius. clerk of the United States Dis
trict Court, from office, and the â¢whole
town is agog over stories of corruption
and attempted jury-packing which this
effort and Its apparent purposes have set
afloat.
Borchsenius received a letter from Judge
Noyes on July 11. requesting him to resign.
T'p to 2 p. m. of July 12. when mall brlng
lnp to San Francisco the most recent ad
vices of the situation In Kome departed,
no response had betn received from
Borchsenius. The clerk was evidently
nonplussed as to how to comply with the
demand and at the same time protect his
own honor against an enforced retirement
and his bondsmen against loss through
Irresponsible handling of about $30,000 of
public moneys then In his custody.
Resignation Demanded.
The letter received by Borchsenius was
fts follows:
NOME. Alaska. July 11. 1*01.

The same day that the resignation of
the clerk was demanded Harry Steel, a
young man who has been active In the
A f.f rnyf . O f j u dgÂ«Â» Noyes nnd In vitupera
tion cf the. latter's enemies, was busy
obtaining bonds to qualify ns Borchsen

UWUCM are In the very thick of the atorm
centrr wrre thrown Into n new state- of
excitement, nnd the assertion became
limited al>Â«ut that Noyes nnd his friends

office and to appoint a elork whom the
Judge could control In the matter of tho
srleoilon nf Jurors, for on thnt peg hangs
\he plan. It Is Mnted. which Judge Noyes
and rÂ»lstrl<-t Attorney Joseph K. Woods
have formed to resist prosecution for con

Noyrs and Woods have both been cited
to appear before tho T'nlted States Circuit

Judpe Noyrs returned from St. Michael
July 4 and was soon after served with the

their common danger has closed the
breach, and they are now co-operating in
framing a defense, and also, it Is asserted.
In planning reprisals upon their enemies.
Judge Noyes has said that he intended
having Attorney Samuel Knight indicted
and William H. Metson disbarred from
practice. It was believed In Nome that If
Noyes succeeded in getting Borchsenius
replaced by a man to his liking indict
ments would bo freely returned against
ell who had been active in opposition to
McKenzie, Noyes, Dubose and the rest
of that crowd.
Charges Against Deputy Clerk.
Borchsenius received his appointment
through the influence of Senator Spooner
and other Influential men in the "States,"
and has not felt himself beholden to
Noyes or others at Nome. Chief Deputy
Clerk Reed, however, waa not an ap
pointee of Borchsenius. and he and the
clerk are at outs. Borcbsenlus has made
serious charges against Reed, but the
court has refused to permit the clerk to
discharge his own chief deputy.
The friction between Borchsenius and
Reed began when Reed, upon Instructions
from the court, attempted to collect his
living expenses. As Reed was appointed
deputy clerk resident at Nome, Bochse
nlus held that he was not entitled to ex
penses. Inasmuch as he was not required
to be absent from Nome. Later Borch
senius detected Reed In accepting papers
in court and taking moneys there, and
afterward depositing the papers among
the flics, preventing 1 Borchsenius from
having any means of checking up the
money that came into his office and for
which he was responsible.
Rumors at Nome credit Borchsenius
with muth graver charges against his
deputy, whom he cannot discharge. One
of these Is that he caught Reed putting a
rubber band around certain names In the

his friends to-day that a thorough inves

An Important Feature.
An important feature In . the . order
directing the court is ' that specif ylng
whether it shall state only the facts
found, ar. shall also give an opinion based
on the facts. Unless the order expressly
requires the members of the court to
give their oplnlon^they are confined to
stating the facts found. It is considered
quite probable, ho'wever, -that .in a case
of this importance the order .woulJ
direct the court to record Its opinion' as
well as its conclusions of facts*.
Congress in 1S95 established the principle
that no court-martial could be held two
years after the occurrence under investi
gation. This is known as the Naval
Statute of Limitation, and while it bars
a court-martial relating to the Santiago
campaign, It does not bar the court of
inquiry. In this case the court of inquiry
would' be " effective only In establishing
records, and would not be preliminary to
a court-martial.

The information that Admiral Schley' s
letter asking for a court of inquiry had

series of press comments have been sent to me
from various parts of the country of a book
entitled "The # History of the Navy," written
by one Edgar Stanton Maclay. From these re

Admiral Schley'B letter is as follows:
GREAT NECK. Long Island. N. Y., July
While Secretary Long was not asked
whether the, court of inquiry would be
asked to form and submit an opinion upon
the facts disclosed by the Investigation,
It Is considered quite probable that this
course will be pursued. Unless the order
convening the, court expressly requires
this opinion to be expressed its report
must be confined to stating the racts
found.' i ;7.> J
Secretary Long said that the personnel
of the court would be made public to
morrow, at which time also the precept
convening the court probably will . be
issued. Meanwhile, there is much specu
lation as to the members of the court
other than Admiral Dewey. The -Secre
tary himself says there Is no warrant of
the announcement of any particular name,
as he still has the question under advise
ment. He has been making inquiries dur
ing the day as to the availability of cer
tain officers and it is understood that
some telegraphic inquiries have been made
of those absent from the city to see If
there is any reason why they should not
serve.
Must State Facts Found.

the naval regulations restrict mo to tho

the personnel of the court to-morrow, and
this will give the Judgo advocate and re
corder nmple tlmo to prepare a list of wit
nesses who are to be summoned. This list
will be necessarily quite lengthy" and ' It
will take some little time to assemble the
officers. I do not believe that the session
of the court will be prolonged, because,
after all, a great deal of the talk over
the Santiago campaign is like the genii's
Vapor, which can be condensed In a small
bottle,"
"Will Admiral Schley be allowed to
name witnesses?"
"Admiral Schley," was the reply, "will
be afforded every opportunity for the ap
pearance of all the witnesses he may de
sire. He is also entitled under the naval
regulations to be represented by counsel."
Sessions Will Be Open.
"Will tho cessions of tuo| court be
open?"
"Unquestionably," was the emphatic re-
court of Inquiry to examine into the entire
matter of Admiral SchleyVcourse. In the
Santiago naval campaign. Later the Sec
retary announced, that owing to the ex
tremely hot weather the court would not
meet until September, and that he would
turn ovor-hls reception room to-the-oburt.
The Secretary eald:
"It !s too hot now. and I do not believe
It would be. very comfortable for officers
to sit In their heavy full dress uniforms
during August. I issued an order some
time ago dispensing with the wearing of
full drees uniforms during a court-mar
tial, but this case will be so Important
that every form of official dignity will te
observed, even to the guard of marines at
the. door. I propose to give the court the
use of the large reception room adjoining
my office, which Is a convenient and com
modious place."

pendent ticket. Driver ran for Clerk and
Bowen for Sheriff on the Democratic
ticket. The returns showed that Driver
and Bowen were elected and they have
held the two offices since. A contest was
instituted in the courts, and the County
Court declared Lovewell and Rhodes
elected. The Circuit Court held to the
contrary, and on appeal the Supreme
Court of Arkansas, on July 23. sustained
the County Court and remanded the cases.
Governor Davis thereupon revoked the
commissions of the incumbents.

Don't You Want to
There was still another case some years
ago somewhat similar to that of the cabal
against Schley. An officer who fed the
boat expedition against the rebel schooner
Judah at the . Pensacola Navy Yard and
captured the vessel lÂ»y boarding on Sep
tember 14, 1861, was highly complimented
at the time for his bravery. Thirty years
later, when a bill was before Congress to
reward this oflioer by promotion, another
officer suddenly revealed the fact that the
alleged hero was lying a* the bottom of
the boat half scared to aeath, and that
while hiaKmen had risked their lives he
had simply acted the coward. This ad
verse recital of the affair was freely dis
cussed among officers and also found its
way into print, resulting In hanging up
the promotion and reward. The victim ol
this slander died a few years ago, but his
traducer still lives and no doubt con
scientiously believes that he had only per
formed his duty as an officer and a gentle
man. He was somewhat slow about it;
thirty* years is a long time to take to con-
Upon his return to the navy after the war
of 1812 he sought reinstatement to active
duty, but was opposed by Commodore De
catur. The quarrel between the two cul
minated in a duel March 22, 1820, in which
Decatur was killed and Barron severely
wounded. Captain Barron remained in
the navy, but was never given a ship, and
he died in 1851, after nfty-three years'
service, of which only four years eight
months was credited to service at sea ana
thirty-three years unemployed.
The second case was that of Commodore
T. Craven, who on March 24, 1865, while
commanding the United States ship Niag
ara, lying in the bay of Coruna, Spain,
failed to accept the challenge of the Con
federate ironclad Stonewall on the ground
that the odds were too largely in favor of
the enemy. A court-martial, composed of
Vice Admiral Farragut, three rear ad
mirals, three commodores and two cap
tains, declared him practically guilty as
charged and sentenced him to suspension
from duty on leave pay for two years.
Secretary Gideon Welles returned the rec
ord to the court for revision, the findings,
in his opinion, being contrary to law, but
the ccurt reiterated its former decision.
The Secretary wrote a letter stingingly
rebuking the members of the court-mar
tial and wound up by setting the proceed
ings aside and relieving Commodore
Craven from arrest, the " sentence being
deemed entirely inadequate as a punish
ment for an offense for which the articles
of the navy may Impose the penalty of
death.

Remedies for dyspepsia have multiplied bo

DECIDES IMPORTANT *
POINT IN-MINING LAW
Locator of a Lode May Follow Its
: Dip Under Adjacent Patented
Land.
RENO, Nev.,' July 24.â The mining case
of Widekind vs. Bell was decided by
Judge Talbot to-day In favor of the plain
tiff. This suit was brought to test the
right of the locator of a lode to follow Its
dip under -land covered by a Unlteo
States agricultural patent, and Is of great
interest to mine owners along the Pacific
Coast. Judge Talbot held that when the
top or apex of a lode was within the ex
terior lines of a valid mining location the
locator had a right to follow its dip into
adjoining patented land, mineral or agri
cultural. This decision gives the Wide
kind location and also the Bell location to
'ohn Sparks, who recently bought the in-
them. When Agnew and Ross learned
this they made George take up the lines.
Ross then sent a man to get them that
they might take them back to McNear
and see if they could get some of their
money back.- Â¦
The prosecution made a vain- attempt
this morning to Impeach Agnew's reputa
tion, but a number of - prominent mer
chants of the city took the stand in his
behalf. Attorney Thomas P. Boyd, for
the defendant.' in his closing address â¢Â¦ to
the jury bitterly arraigned the prosecu

trying to convict an innocent man. > The

Last March, before Agnew was appoint

John George, a Greek fisherman residing

after it is all over everybody who has had anything to do with
either affair Is filled to the brim with a torrid, double-barreled,
back-action tired . feeling that threatens to throw the entire
community into an irredeemable state of lethargic desuetude.
The departure of the city's guests is an occasion for popular
sorrow and rejoicing. . Sorrow because of the sundering of
social ties which the reception and entertainment of strangers
necessarily createdâ rejoicing because in the fullness of time
men become full of a good thing to the paradoxical point, and
then they rejoice at the loss j of that which for an interval
caused them the keenest enjoyment. We are glad they came,'

it is welcomed as a consummation devoutly to be wished for.

PITTSBURG. Pa., July 24.â Two moves,
it is reported, were made by the aggres
sive officials of the American Sheet Steel
Company to-day toward the breaking of
the strike. One was the shipping of some
of the- non-union men that have been
employed in the Vandergrift mills of the
company to Wellsville to assist in the
starting of the plant there. It was stated
that the men were to be shipped to Wells
villÂ© during the early evening and would
reach there after dark. As a consequence
of this report there is suppressed excite
ment pervading Wellsville, which at any
moment may break out into a serious
condition. Both strikers and officials of
the company are on the alert and ready
for any emergency. The impression is
strong to-night that the general officers
of the United States Steel Corporation
have become determined on the subject
of an early breaking of the strike and
to ultimately force the operation of all
the idle plants.
Second Important Move.
The second move that is understood to
have been initiated to-day is the starting
of the long idle Hyde Park plant of the
American Sheet Steel Company. This
plant was taken into the combination,
burdened with objectionable contracts
made by the former owners and has re
mained idle since. .The long idleness of
this mill has caused most of the men for
merly employed there to leave Hyde
Park for other places, and the company
believes there would be less difficulty in
starting this plant than where the Amal
gamated Association has control.
It was apparent In Pittsburg this even-
Ing that fresh and decidedly important
developments in the strike of the steel
workers were about to take place.
At the Amalgamated headquarters the
two leading officials of the association
were absent during the greater part of
the day. It wa3 stated that President
Shaffer was away on personal business
and had nothing in hand concerning the
strike. The absence of Secretary John
"Williams was also accounted for in the
same manner. The conference held on
Tuesday night, which kept President
Shaffer and Secretary Williams out until
early this, morning remains as mysteri
ous as before. None of these officials
would give out any hint as to what ha<3
taken place aside from stating positively
that thev had not met any of the officials
of the "United States Steel Corporation.
Whatever the object of the meeting, it i3
believed to have been continued to-day,
and much of importance is expected to he
developed from the conference.
Question of Injunctions.
The question of the manufacturers se
curing injunctions against the Amalga
mated Association was discussed guard
edly during the day. Assistant Secretary
M. F. Tighe said he did not 'think the
measure would be resorted to at this
stage of the proceedings, -even If it was
contemplated for a later day. There was
practically no cause for such a meas
ure, and if there was he doubted if, un
der the conditions that exist at present,
the courts would grant such orders. ' Par
ticularly is this the case in Pennsyl
vania. In Ohio President Shaffer seemed
to Â¦ feel confident that such injunctions
would not be granted. Those best ac
quainted with the feelings of the manu
facturers say there is, in their opinion,
little cause for believing that such meas
ures will be resorted to at this time.
terest of George Widekind in the Reno
Star. .
A few weeks ago Judge Curler denied
Widekind an injunction to restrain Bell
from taking out ore en his claim adjoin
ing the Reno Star on land upon which
Bell held a United States patent. The de
cision was followed by the present suit,
and In the Interim Bell put up steam
hoisting works and worked his claim to

who shqiÂ»himself near Congress. A few
days ago Miss Ethel Kent was accident
ally ohot and killed by Ohmerty's gun,
which he had leaned against a rock near

down and it exploded, giving her a wound
from which she died a few hours later.

in sight, either in Kansas City or any
part of the Southwest. In the twenty-four
hours the rain .reported has been showers
at Hayes, Central Kansas, last night, and
at El Reno, O. T., at noon to-day. Five
deaths directly attributable to the heat

TOPEKA. Kans.. July 24.â The heat
record for Kansas was broken again to
day. This has been the regular announce
ment for several days past, but to-dav the
official record at the University of Kan
sas showed a temperature of 10S degrees.
In Topeka the Government's record gave
it as 106 degrees, while good thermometers
on the street registered 110 and 112 de
grees. Manhattan reports 112 degrees.
Emporia 112. Ottawa 110, Wichita 104 and
Abilene 10?. Numerous prostrations are
reported, and In Abilene there were three
deaths.
No rains of any consequence have fallen
in the State during the day. Central Kan
sas was the only place having even light
thunder showers. "What rains fell yester
day served only to temporarily reduce the
extremely high condition of the atmos
phere. To-mght no relief is in sight.
There was some thunder early in the
evening, but it looks now as if the threat
ened rain had passed over again, as it has
done a dozen times within the past two
weeks.
Everything is stifled with dust, and the
people of Kansas are beginning 1 to realize
in all its fullness what a drought is. The
financial part of the situation is lost sight
of for the present. What is being thought
of now Ss the extreme physical discom
fort resulting from the heat, the alarminp
scarcity of drinking and stock water and
the prospect of much sickness after the
heated spell.

SenatorBulla, BelleveChances for Wresting Con
trol of Southern California From Gage Are Bright
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 24.â There Is little
doubt that former State Senator Robert
N. Bulla will lead the forces of Thomas
Flint Jr. against those of Governor Gage
in the coming battle for supremacy south
of the Tehachapl. Senator Bulla declared
himself for Flint some weeks ago. Sen
ator Flint will not say that he has select
ed his Southern leader. He says that he
is "looking around" and Is pleased with
.conditions as he has found them. Senator
Bulla is equally non-committal, but those
who are informed in things political are
well aware that Flint is In the fight and
that Bulla Is to be his prophet.
The Governor's followers are confident
that Los Angeles is safe for them. The
Flint people are confident that they have
something better than a fighting chance
and declare that the hardest battle that
will occur between the two opponents will
be fcr the control of Southern California.
Senator Flint spent most of to-day in
band, who Is living In Utah, and that "Will
Baker Is young Bender.
Mrs. Ayres denies that she Is Kate
Bender, and declares that she will prove
an alibi. She Is about 50 years old. It is
said that Edward L. Burton, a lawyer of
Oswego, Kan., together with an old resi
dent of Galena, who knew the Benders,
are at present in Fort Collins for the pur
pose of making a positive identification of
the persons suspected if possible.
Governor Orman is out' of the city,' but
his private secretary says that the requi
sition papers mentioned in the Topeka
dispatch have not yet been received.

Another favorite method employed by
Judge Noyes, according to Clerk Borch
senius, was to direct the clerk to select
but two or three names from the jury box
and then to issue a special venire from
which to complete the i panel both for
grand and petty jury purposes. By such
manipulation and by watching the juries
and discharging the recalcitrant mem
bers, Borchsenius claims, it was possible
to obtain Juries that could be â¢ depended
upon to find in favor of the claim jumpers.
Those who give credence to these
charges -point -further to the fact that
though Judge Noyes had given â¢public no-
Borch&enius and reputable attorneys at'
Nome are recalling the fact that the
grand jurors impaneled for the first term
of court held at Nome by Judge Noyes did
not suit the court and they were dls-1
charged. Neither did the next jury please
his fancy, nor the. next, until nearly 200'
names had been drawn from the Jury box. ;
More recently, it is alleged, grand jurors
have been excused in great numbers and
others â¢ selected without a discharge of
the grand jury or the issuance of &Â¦ spe-'
cial venire. Â¦ . Â¦
It- is claimed that District Attorney
"Woods and Reed selected twenty-four
names fiom the Grand Jury panel of 300
names to be drawn for last February.
Judge Â» Noyes, rumor- has it, asked
Borchsenius to draw those names, but the
clerk refused to comply. Judge Noyes said
that In Minnesota, Dakota and all Federal
courts in the States it was usual for the
clerk to ignore the jury box and make
selections after scrutinizing the names of
the panel and deciding what names it was'
Â¦wise to have drawn. Borchsenius, how
ever, was obdurate and the names .were
regularly drawn.
These rumors, bruited about among min
ers wildly excited on account of litigation
over claims in the Kougorok, . Bluestone
and other districts lying north and west
of Nome, as well as over the Topkok and
other Nome receivership cases, include
stories of alleged ' irregularities on the
part of Judge Noyes himself. Borchsenius
is made sponsor for these charges also,
and, as in the case of Reed, jury-fixing
is the particular form of the alleged In
iquity. - -v.
jury box, so that he could detect them
upon putting his hand in the box to draw
the jurors. Another is that he detected
Reed carefully arranging certain names
in a bunch, putting the bunch directly .be
neath the opening of the box and taking
excessive care that the box was not
shaken before the jurors were drawn.

The Republican Primary League's ef
forts to arouse public interest in the pri
mary election are appreciated. Activity
prevails at league headquarters. Inter
ested citizens from the various Assembly
districts meet daily at 930 'Market street
Baldwin Annex, to compare plans. The
Kfclly-Crimmlns rendezvous is deserted
while the league rooms are crowded. This
signifies to observers of the contest that
the allied bosses will be beaten out of
Eight August 13.
Proof that the bosses are weakening is
found in the fact that the Kelly-Crim
mins Club of the Forty-first District last
night proposed to compromise with the
Anti-Boes Club, of which Horace Davis is
president. The boss contingent put for
ward a flimsy pretense that harmony was
desired. The motto of good citizens in the
Forty-first should be "No compromise
Republican Primary League.
There is yet some talk of Henry T.
Gage going before the Republican con
vention of 1902 and asking for renomina
tion for Governor. Reports from the in
terior are to the effect that Gage stock
is on the decline. A definite announce
ment to the effect that he is not a candi
date would not surprise the politicians.
The contest for the United States Sena
torship is assuming such peculiar shape
that Gage may accept the original pro
gramme and enter the field as a candi
date to succeed Perkins in the Senate.
Politicians who are well disposed toward
Gage say that there is no force in the
suggestion that the south should not have
both Senators. It is recalled that San
MateÂ© County once had both Senators â
Leland Stanford and Charles N. Felton.
San Francisco has been so honored'sev
eral times. Should Gage decide to enter
the contest for the Senatorship he would
doubtless cast his influence in favor of a
man from the north for Governor.
The recent Interference of the State ad
ministration in the municipal affairs of
San Francisco has intensified the unpop
ularity of the Governor. He is unpopular
in San Francisco and in a political sense
almost friendless ia Santa Clara. San
Joaquin, Solano, Sonoma and Sacramento

State Board of Examiners, is also expert
in making enemies for the administration

adversaries without half trying that it is

Gage and the Senatorship.
IN the Republican State Convention at
Sacramento in 1S9S the Northern Cal
ifornia delegations were outvoted and
outgeneraled. In the make-up of the
ticket little or no recognition was
given to the Republicans of that region.
They .accepted the decree of the con
vention, promised to stand by the
ticket and fulfilled the pledge at
the polls. Next year the northern
delegations will demand recognition,
and the wise politicians predict that tha
demand will be respected. One of the
three nominations for the Supreme bench
will probably go to a northern candidate.
Edward Sweeney, Judge of the Superior
Court of Shasta County, is in the field
again as a candidate. It is supposed that
he is in sympathy with the movement to
displace W. H. Beatty and promote C. H-
Garoutte to the office of Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court. John F. Ellison. Su
perior Judge of Tehama County, is highly
Epoken of by the lawyers of Northern
California. He is not a politician or a
seeker of office. Ten years ago he sur
rendered a lucrative law practice in re
sponse to a pressing demand for his ser
vices on the Superior bench. There is a
sentiment among Republicans in the
northern counties in favor of his nomina
tion for Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. The terms respectively of W. H.
Beatty. Chief Justice, and C. H.- Garoutte
and Ralph C. Harrison, Associate Justice,
will expire one year from next January.
Beatty is from Sacramento, Garoutte from

i Ihe clerk and Judge Noyes had a tilt
also over the handling of public moneys.
The Treasury Department a year ago in
structed Borchsenius by letter to send all
moneys held by him to an outside Gov
ernment depository when at the end of
any quarter it should exceed $3000. Noyes
desired to keep these funds in Nome, sub
ject to his orders. To checkmate the at
tempt of Borchsenius to comply with the
department's order, the Judge made an
order -changing the beginning of the li
cense year from July 1 to November 1.
As navigation closes by November 1 at
the latest, Borchsenius was prevented un
der the new order from sending the li
cense moneys in his charge beyond Noyes*
Jurisdiction. -
tice, on June 14, of a term of court to con
veneatNome July 15, and had set for
trial two cases to take precedure over all
others on the calendar, up to the' after
noon of July 12 no attempt had been made
to impanel a jury for the term. The In
ference was plain, the opponents of Noyes
claimed, that the court was waiting until
a plastic clerk should be substituted for
the obdurate Borchsenius.

Many hair preparations are "fake" be-

They often cause a dryness, making- the
hair brittle and, finally, lifeless. Dandruff
is the cause of all trouble with hair. It is
a germ disease. The germ makes cuticle
scales as it digs to the root of the hair,
where it destroys the hair's vitality, caus-
ing. the hair to fall out. . To cure dandruff
the germ must be killed. "Destroy the

The plan to put an electric lighting
plant In Tosemlte Valley met with an un
expected check at the meeting of tne'
Ccmmlssloners yesterday, and It may re
sult in' the postponement of the work until
next year. There were but three Com
missioners at the meetingâ W. "W. Foote,
Charles G. Clinch and Frank. H. Short ot
Fresno. On motion of Foote, Short took
the chair, and Secretary Lermen, after
reading, two or three ''unimportant letters
from the guardian of the valley, said that
the next business in order was the con
sideration of the proposed | electric light
ing. Secretary Lermen said that he had
been in consultation with a deputy in- the
Attorney General's office who had called
his attention to an old law, under the
provisions of which, it was "the opinion
of the deputy, no work of the character
contemplated could be done until the
commission had advertised for plans for
the- work, paying a premium for any
plans that might be accepted. The deputy
had advised Lermen to ask - for aa - opin
ion from the Attorney General upon, this
point before going ahead, and as Com
missioner Short, who had been consulted,
had given like advice Lermen had ad
dressed a letter accordingly to Attorney,
General Ford: â¢ . Â¦ - â¢Â¦ ; Â¦Â¦'"Â¦ : j
"And how long will that take?" asked
Foote. Â¦Â¦â¢ . - . â¢ â¢. ~- - -
"Well," replied Lermen, "I could pos
sibly get an opinion to-morrow. Then we
would have- to, advertise for plans for,
say, five days." r
- "And -consider them and approve one,
perhaps," said Foote, "and then adver
tise for bids, for the work. I suppose that
would take two months." . Â¦"
, "Not more than that," said Lermen.
â¢ "Then" the upshot of It would be that
we could do nothing this year," said
Foote, with, some disgust. "Now, I'll tell
you what, I don't want to turn thia money
back to the State." ' Â¦';jy > ' r '
The Work Must Wait.
"The deputy I saw said we could not
do much before .the first of the year, any
way," said Lermen.' ; -
"There seems nothing' else for It .than
to wait until we hear from the Attorney
General,, now that we have asked his
opinion," 1 Clinch observed.
"Why can't we go ahead and advertise
anyway?" Foote asked. "It would do no
harm even if it should be held that this
law does not bind us. J do not think it
does, anyway."
"Neither do I," agreed Clinch.
"All the same, it would be better to
wait," said Short. ,< '.
I And so it was agreed, on motion of
Foote, that the secretary be instructed,
if the Attorney General rules that it is
necessary to advertise for plans, to go
ahead and advertise, the commission ad
journing to meet next Wednesday at 4
p. m. to approve whatever he might do
in the meantime and to proceed with
such, further action as new developments
might seem to warrant.
Engineer Corey, who was present with
plans and specifications already prepared,
showed by his estimates that the water
system it is proposed to install in the val
ley would cost $1315, the electric lighting
plant for the hotel and public buildings
$21,605 and the freighting of material into
the' valley about $400. This approaches so
close to the limit of the appropriation ot
$25,000 that the proposition to throw
searchlights- upon Yosemite Falls will, in
all. probability, be allowed to go over un
til the next Legislature can be asked for
an appropriation for the scheme.

' Fire Marshal Towe Injured.
Fire Marshal Charles TbweV met with
an accident yesterday : which will leave
him with a stiff knee for several months.
He had been to St. Luke's 'Hospital, ; and
as he was about to . step Into his buggy
he observed a runaway, horse approach
ing. He had barely time to turn A his
horse's head toward the sidewalk before
the runaway struck the rear wheel of his
buggy. Towe's horse reared and in com
ing down -struck Towe on the left knee
with his fore foot, inflicting a deep lacer
ated wound. Towe was taken to the hos-'

Mr. Campbell criticized California Con-
ordered the Oregon. "Wisconsin and Iowa
away from California for repairs. The
Bennington. Wentworth and Concord were
repaired elsewhere.- Large sums of money
were exnended for the repairs of these
vessels, all of which ought to have come
to California. No fight had been made,
the reason being the delay of the Secre
tary of the Navy In signing the papers
necessary for beginning work on the stone
drydock, which had been tied up eighteen
months. Campbell said he believed that
Jim Hill of the Great Northern and the
business men of Seattle were back of the
movement to delay the stone drydock and
hnd used their influence .with the chief
of the Bureau of Yards and Docks to that
end, that Port Orchard might be profited.
Mr. Campbell also described the hardships
that result by the laying off of men. Five
hundred had been taken off and there
would be additional reductions. The Val
lejo people would be glad if the Scotts
could have fifty., ships to build, but that
was no reason why Mare Island should
not have one. The Cincinnati. Raleigh,
Newark and Baltimore were all ordered
to the vard. but other influences prevailed
and they were sent East. This meant a
loss of $1,000,000. Mr. Campbell represent
ed the Vallejo view of the situation.

business was booming on the Boston navy
A. A. Watklns, president of the San
Francisco Board of Trade, announced that
resolutions that had been submitted would
be referred to a committee of the Board
of Trade for action. They were not read.
A. C. Rulofson of Baker & Hamilton
deprecated criticism of California Con
gressmen and Â¦ others. . He submitted a
practical suggestion, which was that a
representative, or perhaps two, in touch
with California's business interests should
be kept continuously at Washington to
keep Congressmen Informed, to let the
people here know what was going on in
the departments and to. do other useful
work.
Brace Hayden of the Dunham, Carrigan
& Hayden Company advocated unifV and
favored the idea advocated by Mr. Rulof-
The whole matter will come soon before
the San Francisco Board of-Trade, and
other commercial organizations of San
Francisco will be requested to take ac
tion to influence the proper authorities to
do justice to Mare Island.

â¢ SCENES INCIDENT TO VISIT OF
SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS MEN
TO MARE ISLAND.
p-u^a HE Mare Island Navy Yard yester-
I day had the undivided attention of
â¢ & great number of San Francisco
jl business men. mainly -wholesalers,
who represented every mercantile
ine. At 10 o'clock they embarked on the
tteamer General Frisbie. They were es
corted by a live delegation from Vallejo
ind officers from the navy yard. C. W.
Edgcumb* of the navy pay office, who
was largelr Instrumental In the excursion
plan, iras of the party. In all respects it
was a Mare Island day. George J. Camp
oell Jr. of the Vallejo Board of Trade
x.ade an eanifst speech early in the day,
n which he pointed out a programme for
:he benefit of the navy yard. The party
urjehed on the steamer. At Mare Island
:hey were escorted about the yard by offl
>Â«?rs of the navy. The navy yard band
serenaded thÂ« *-isit<Â»rs. On the homeward
trip there were more speeches.
Xo new work was in progress at the
navy yard and the repair work was at a
low ebb. ThrrÂ« conditions and the spec
tacle of the diversion of the work of the
oaval vessels on the Pacific Coast and on
the Asiatic elation to the navy yard at
Port Orchard and the Atlantic coast ship
yards f urnistif d the -motive for the excur
sion. The sp*Â«Â»ches of the day were all
strongly in favor of sending repair work
to Mare Island and for exercising all pos
sible pressure to that f-nd. As auxiliary
thp speedy completion of the stone dry-
Sock and the deepening of the channel to
Mare Island were urged.
Campbell Speaks for Vallejo.
George J. Campbell Jr. opened the dis
cussion. H> said that Vallejo merchants
had for many years labored to establish
trood will between San Francisco and Va!
i<?jo. They believed that Vallejo was of
as much interest to San Francisco as'anv
action in the city. Kver.v dollar's worth
of goods bought an<3 consumed in Vallejo
rarne from San Francisco. He was glad
to see the merchants of San Francisco
gressmen and the Secretary of the 'Navy.
Congressmen had, he said, failed to act
vigorously in behalf of Mare Island, the
deterring force being the Union Iron
i "Works. The Secretary of the Navy had
expending $100,000,000 to $123,000,000 for work
on \ its naval vessels, Mare Islandls get
ting only a small share. That was due to
lack of unity and proper exertion. Secre

ENLARGING OUR FACTORY.
Â¦ An architect has draw n plans for an addition to the Regal fac- '<
tory. . The building is now being. erected. This addition will add
to the output of Regal Shoes fully 331-3 per cent. The increased .
capacity is needed to supply the demand for Regal Shoes.- The .
' demand for this popular shoe has been so great that the manufac-
turers have been compelled to enlarge their factory eight times
within seven years. At no time within the past seven years have
Â¦the manufacturers been able to make Regal Shoes fast enough to
Â¦ supply the demand. â¢ This demand is the natural result of a meri T
torious shoe. If Regal Shoes were not good shoes the manufactur-
ers-would , not need the. service of an architect, their 'fac-
tory would not have needed enlarging eight times in seven years,
Â¦ and the shoes could, easily be made as fast as' they could be sold.

by their neglect of political duties they .show
of self-respect, for what honorable man can tamely
submit to permit his party and his city to be domi
nated by such a creature as Kelly and the gang who
surround him.
Throughout the Republican ranks is at this
time a strong movement against the bosses. Its
effects are to be seen in all sections of the city, and
in every district where clubs are being organized for
work during the campaign. Still there are a number
of men who stand aside and take no part in the fight
They are not unintelligent men and they would rightly
the rank and file of the Republican party to-day just
as boldly as it confronted the Legislature of Illinois
at the last session. The victory for honest politics,
genuine Republicanism and good municipal govern
ment can be won only by good men who are reso
lute to perform all their political duties.
To every stanch and true Republican- the issue
comes as a matter of personal duty. It is even, one
duties are giving such a boss as Martin Kelly a
chance at least of obtaining domination in municipal
affairs? The issue of boss control is drawn as sharply*
t in this city as in any other in the nation. It confronts
legislation of the last session of the Illinois Legisla
ture. He is reported to have added that the man who
exerted that control took little part in debates, was
rarely heard on the floor, and showed no outward
manifestation of leadership, nevertheless his dictation
was %'irtually undisputed. His power was due to the
fact that he represented the political machine.
Republicans of San Francisco will hardly read that
declaration without pronouncing some sort of con
demnation upon the people of Illinois who submit
to such domination at the hands of bosses. They will
admit that if the statements attributed to Lieutenant
Governor Xorthcott be true, then the freemen and
voters of Illinois are false to every duty of American
citzenship, and are scarcely worthy of the franchise
bestowed upon them.
What, then, shall be said of the Republicans of San
Francisco who through indifference to their political

That is the value put upon rain by people from whom
it has long been withheld. The lesson ought not to
be lost upon any part of the country west of, the Mis
sissippi, for over all this vast region there is danger
of dry years. The conservation of water should be
one of the most careful tasks of every Western'com
munity. The duty is as important in California as
anywhere else, and it is to be hoped it will soon be
undertaken- oh scientific principles and on a com
prehensive scale. Â¦; v..
The intensity of the heat and the damage done by
it to the farmers can hardly \ be understood here,
where even in the dryest years we never have any
thing approaching the fearful conditions that npw
afflict nearly^ the whole of the great valley of the
Mississippi. Some idea of the condition there may
be formed from the report that a rain of fifteen min
utes around Wichita was estimated by the people
of the district to have been worth $10,000,000 to theTr
fruit and corn. , . >*.
One of our exchanges in describing the joy of the
people at the coming of the rain says: "The farmer
who drove into town announcing the first raindrops
caused a jubilatioa. It brought out the brass bandT
Hundreds of men and women began to cheer" and
sing hymns as the rain fell. Factories closed to allow
their employes to stand in the rain until soaking wet,
for the mercury had been standing at 115; degrees.
The whole was followed by a grand march of the peo
ple into the churches, soaking wet' where thanksgiv
ine was offered." . â¢ _ .
ONCE more a blasting wave of heat has af
flicted the corn States, and this visitation ap
pears to be even worse than the former one.
The rains of a few days ago which promised to break
the heated spell and mark the beginning of cooler
weather have proven deceptive. They have passed
rapidly, away and the intense heat returns. In the
country crops are being blighted in. the fields, and
in^the towns and cities men and animals are falling
prostrate in the streets.
,THE V^LTJE OF 'WATER.
In one of the suburbs of Chicago the authorities'
collected 101 unlicensed dogs, and then offered
a prize to the man who could kill most of them in a
given time. The prize was won by a policeman, who
dispatched thirty-six.
Â¦Warming up to , the real issue of .the subject, the
writer goes on to say: "The role of fat in political
physiology cannot be summed up in a simple
formula; but for practical purposes it will be found
tolerably safe to assume that thinness s makes for
revolution and fleshiness for repose, which, expressed
in terms of politics, means conservatism. The. ideal
demagogue is leanâ tourmente par son caractere, as
Mme.de Stael said Napoleon ought to have been. . A
man who has a full, round belly, with good capon
lined, is by the law of his physical being a conserva
tive, whose principle is quieta non movere, though he
may delude himself and others with the fancy that he
is a radical. Those of our American friends who think
that the well being of the United States depends on
the maintenance of a republican form of government
will do well to take steps . at once to repress the
tendency to abdominal expansion among their: citi
zens, or they may live to see the President trans
forfned into an: emperor."
1 There then is the danger that confronts our. Deoole
Having that statement of facts to start- with the
Medical Journal proceeds to argue that fat men are
not so enterprising. or so pugnacious as lean men.
It recalls the remark of Caesar that men who are, thin
as Cassius was are dangerous, .but that no harm is
to be feared from those who are fat and sleep at
night. It cites the opinion of military experts that'
the main cause of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo was
that he was too fat to act with his old time vigor,
and says:* "If Louis XVI. had been less protuberant
in the paunch he might have kept his head on his
shoulders." Thence it proceeds to lay down the
proposition that the increasing corpulence of the
American people may have very important conse
quences in the world of industry and of politics.
The prediction is due to certain studies, made by
some statistical fiend concerning the increase of cor
pulence among the people of New York. The in
vestigator is said to have discovered that among New
Yorkers over the age "of 20 a large per cent showed
an abnormal development in the abdominal region.
The report goes on Â¦ to v say : "In a poor quarter the
percentage of fat men was about 14, but in Broad
way, where the well-to-do most do congregate', it was
35. In the corridors of ahigh class residential hotel
the number of obese individuals in a. total' of 100 was
70, while in a humbler caravansary the percentage sank
to 11, the lowest point anywhere noted. Altogether
among 1500 adults, taken at random, 447 were cor
pulent to the degree of deformity, giving an average
of 29.8 per cent."
WHILE we are rejoicing in our vigor and
are sanguine that for many a generation yet
to come the American race will go forward
to new enterprises with undiminished vigor, the
British Medical Journal forecasts a change in our
characteristics and even intimates that we are in
danger of becoming conservatively sluggish and fall
ing under the dominion of a fat emperor.

Let me ask you to look over the names of thos^ who have
been apprehended for violations of the 'game and/fish laws of
this State and see if you do not find nine-tenths of them to be
foreignersâ men who would not be allowed to have a gun in
their possession In their native country. But the moment they
arrive in this glorious State of ours, where they are permitted
to own a gun, the first thing ' they do* is to jret one and go
forth and shoot anything they see, regardless of law or nature.
This State Is full of this class of people, and particularly where
j.he most game Is, and to this class of people Is due the rapid
decrease in our supply of game and fish. They care nothing
for you or I or the future. It Is the present with them and
the .."almighty dollar." This, class of men have invaded our
fields and streams with every device conceivable for 'the de
struction of our game -and fish,- in season and out, until our
supply of game Is nearly^all gone and it is hard to take a re
spectable bag of game or a decent creel of fish;* and to these
I was born and raised in this State, and ever since I was
old enough have hunted and fished from Oregon down, and I
believe that I have some practical knowledge' of the deer as
well as other game.- Had such a law as the present one been'
in force in this te for the past fifteen years there would be
plenty of gamÂ§ for all now, and I speak from personal knowl
edge.
I have seen the natural resorts for game of all kinds de
stroyed by the rapid advance of civilization. Deer, duck and
quail have been shot, trapped and driven from their natural
resorts and breeding grounds at all seasons of the year, and no
regard has been paid to them except by a few sportsmen of
this and near-by . States, until now they have become very
scarce. While on a hunting: trip in Southern Oregon in August,
1892, I counted the carcasses of seventy-two deer lying along
side the trail I was traveling in one day. All these deer had
been killed for their hides; aqd on the same trip I met two
half-breeds with nearly 300 depr hides on two mules. These
deer had be<Â»n killed on Government land that had not even
been sectionizecl. -They informed' me that they got from 30 cents
to 65 cents apiece for these hides.. These men could have been
easily prosecuted, but there was no Warden,' no Judge and ap
parently no law, and if there was. there was certainly no re
gard for it. These deer had been killed during the spring and
while they- were following up the "snow and when no man
would kill a deer under any circumstances. The hides were
taken across the line to "Smith River Corners," In California,
and sold, and the half-breeds got on a drunk with the proceeds.
Even in this late clay mother quail have been, shot off their
nests and their young left to perish. This "was done in this
county the other day. However, I was fortunate enough to
convict the violator for his dastardly work; but in some locali
ties, notably in the vicinity of San Jose, juries composed of
those who call themselves citizens and men havd released the
violators when the wardens have been able to detect them in
the commission of their crime.
The Call does not hold Usel* responsible for the' opinions published in this column, but presents them for whatever value they may have
as communications of general Interest.
Editor San Francisco Call: For a great many years I have
been a subscriber to and an admirer of The Call and its policy,
but I cannot agree with it in its views in regard to our game
laws. . â¢ " . /
pot-hunters and poachers is due the depletlonof our fields and
streams.
We have as good a set of game laws to-day as it has been
possible to get with our present constitution. Any kind of a
law, unless rigidly enforced, is of no avail, and if such great
papers as The Call would look carefully into the matter and
instead of trying to tear down what honest and true sports
men have built up would lend their power and influence toward
the enforcement of the Jaws we have, and the betterment of
them, we could accomplish much. Such editorials as the one
of July 14 in a paper like^ The Call conveys to those not thor
oughly informed a disregard for the law. &nd instead of assist
ing in creating- a healthy respect for the value and benefit of
our game .and the necessity of good laws to protect It. and the
rigid enforcement of such laws as we have, in order that wo
imay revive our ? fast decreasing supply of game, it leads them
to believe that they should regard no law, and that In violating
the law they would receive the support- of your valuable
paper (which I do not believe they would receive). Neverthe
less It creates a disregard for the law anil makes It hard far
wardens to make them see the wrong they are doirsg. It iÂ«
true that there are a few minor changes that might be made
in the present law, but they are of no very great importance
where one law has to cover the whole State, as the present
law does under our constitution. The sale of game should
never be permitted. The sale of game places a bounty on Its
distribution, and it can never be successfully protected as long 1
as it can be sold.
In my'' opinion. If the quail law oners on October 1 the deer
law should run until October 13. This would give those who go
out Into the mountains on a hunting trip a chance to shoot
deer, quail and catch trout for fifteen daysâ or in other words,
would leave an open season of fifteen days on all game and
flshâ which I believe w<juld be right and would result in no
harm. .%.â¢*Â¦;
A limit should be placed on the bag that may be made in
one day and in the number of trout that may be taken In on*
day. and these laws â all of them â should be strictly enforced
without fear or favor. Wardens should be appointed irre
spective of politics or pull and should be maintained as long ks
they perfrfrm the duties of their office faithfully, and wtien
they neglect their duties they should immediately be dis
charged. The wardens should receive the support of the pub
lic and the press in the discharge of their duties In the en
forcement of the law-relative to the protection of same and
fish. As a warden I have no. hesitation In doing my utmost to
enforce the present, game and fish laws, as I believe they are
about as near right as it is possible to get them under the
present circumstances. There are a few minor measures that
may be improved upon, but in the main they are all right. I
have hunted for market and sport and sneak from my own
personal knowledge coverinsr a period of thirty years, not one
of which have I ever missed being: In the field
Hopinsr you will excuse mÂ« for taking un so much of vour

THOUSANDS of people in every part of the world will
feel a pang of regret at the intelligence that the original
of Charles Dickens' "Old Curiosity Shop" is to be torn
down to give place to a modern structure. It is said by
â¢ those who watch the sightseers that no place except the
Tower of London attracts so many intelligently interested vis
itors as this queer little place that lives in the memory of
every reader of Dickens as the home of Little Nell and Grand
father. Looking into the old-fashioned windows from the
street one can imagine how the impossible Quilp back of one
of them lay and gurgled in the tiny bedroom of Little Nell
while she and her grandfather stole out and away from the
sorrow that had cast so deep a shadow over them.
"The place," says Dickens, "was one of those receptacles
for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd cor-
nera of this town, and to hide their musty treasures from the
public eye In jealousy and distrust. There were sult3 of mall
standing like ghosts In armor, here and there: fantastic carv
ings brought from monkish cloisters; musty weapons of vari
ous kinds; distorted figures in china, and wood, and Iron;
tapestries and strange furniture that might have been de
signed in dreams. The haggard aspect of the little old man
was -wonderfully suited to the place: he might have groped
among the churches and tombs, and deserted houses, and
gathered all the spoils with his own hands. There was nothing
in the whole collection but was In keeping with himself; noth
ing that looked older or more worn than he."
The queer old place has been turned into a waste-paper shop
in recent years, but has never lost that curious appearance
which must have originally attracted the novelist.
IT WILL INTEREST EVERT READER OF CHARLES DICKENS TO KNOW THAT THE "OLD CURIOSTTT
SHOP," ABOUT WHICH THE GREAT ENGLISH NOVELIST WROTE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL STORT. 13 TO
MAKE WAY FOR AN UP-TO-DATE STRUCTURE.
It would seem from that statement that the British
are at last willing to abrogate the old treaty, and that
we are in a fair way of getting rid of that ob
stacle to the much desired canal. It will then be
seen what new' objection the opponents of the en
terprise can make. Public expectation of an early
beginning of the work has been so often disappointed
that few persons will be sanguine of immediate suc
cess even now. Still there is good cause for gratifi
cation in the reports of progress made in preparing a
satisfactory treaty, and the people of this country will
cordially share Lord Pauncefote's hope that it will be
of such a nature as to meet the approval and receive
the ratification of the Senate.
The main point of the controversy is the abroga
tion of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and the recognition
of the right of the United States to fortify the canal.
It will be remembered the British stremgly combated
the right of the United States to annul, the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty, and insisted that it should not be super
seded without giving Great Britain something in the
way of an- equivalent.
Since Pauncefote has hopes that the new treaty, will
be satisfactory to both . nations, it is fair to assume
that the old stumbling-blocks have been j removed.
He is reporte'd as having said in the course of his in
terview: "It goes without saying that the President
has made himself cognizant of the opinions of the
Senate and of the Secretary of State. * * * You
may be sure whatever is agreed upon between the
two Governments will meet the approval of the
Senate."
It is well known that ever since the British Min
istry rejected the treaty proposed by the. Senate Sec
retary Hay and Lord Pauncefote have been busy in
drafting a new one. Â¦ Mr. Hay has been in consulta
tion with- leaders in. the Senate, and o,f course - has
sought to frame a treaty in accord with their .views.
It is understood that Pauncefote carried that treaty to
London with him,' : and his recent statement to the
press is taken as an assurance that the British Min
istry accepts it. The rest remains with the Senate.
; That statement is pertinent to the recent dispatch
from London that Lord Pauncefote made a statement
to the Associated Press to the effect that on his return
to Washington in October he will bring withMiim a
new isthmian canal, treaty, which he "hopes" will be
satisfactory to President McKinley, the Secretary of
State and the Senate. In expressing the "hope" Lord
Pauncefote .was doubtless using language that has
more sincerity than is usually found in diplomacy. In
view of the rejection of the former treaty made with
Secretary Hay, and Cleveland's reference to the "cus
tomary disfigurement" of treaties by- the United States
Senate, it will be recognized that his Lordship is not
justified in' entertaining anything more than a hope.
G ROVER CLEVELAND in his Princeton lec
. ture on the VeneziHelan boundary "con
troversy says in reference to the settlement
of the question: "The fact must not be overlooked
that notwithstanding this treaty was promoted and
negotiated by. the officers of our Government; the par
ties to it were Great Britain and Venezuela.' This
was a fortunate circumstance, inasmuch as. the work
accomplished was thus saved from the. risk of cus
tomary disfigurement at the hands of the United
States Senate."
A NEW CANAL TREATY.
Southern people who ; erit North to spendâ the
summer this; year 'are now wishing they had stayed
at home, but had they done so they, would probably
be wishing they had done the other thing^ In fact,,
the. only, way to be contented in summer is: to come,
to California.
We are, with our present lights, Moable to "see
wherein sportsmen themselves can disagree with the
foregoing statement of our position. As for the ex
isting law, whatever its defects, we will do what the
press can in supporting its enforcement for the salce
of the measure of protection it affords.
We believe that the people would sustain a close
season for deer of five years, with five years limited
open seasons to follow, and so on alternately; and
that like close periods for other game, determined by
its breeding and the rapidity of its renewal, would
be sustained. But the law-must not exclude the pub
lic from its benefits and include therein the small mi
nority of sportsmen.
The present season deer will be killed lawfully that
are unfit for ; food. They will be killed because it is
the only chance to take them, and the venison will be
wasted. It is just as much waste as that wanton sac
rifice by the hide-hunting Indians of Oregon de
scribed, by Mr. Welch.
But such laws are for the benefit of all the people,
and not for a class. ' Here we part company with our
very able correspondent, Game Warden Welch. A
game law that forbids the sale of game and is for the
benefit of "sportsmen" only is class legislation, re
pugnant to the people. Let the game be rigidly pre
served, the bag that one gunner may take limited,
but let his. surplus go into the market, where the pub
lic can buy and enjoy it. No one man can eat/ three
deer. Let one man take only three and send
what he does not use to market. The result will be
a reasonable supply forthe benefit of the public. The
same limitation of bag may apply to ducks, . quail,
grouse, woodcock and other game birds, but let the
surplus of the bag, over what its taker can consume,
go to market. Only a small minority of the people
are of the sportsman class. The kind of law favored
by Warden Welch would be for the pleasure of that
minority only, and the general public would never
know the taste of game at all. y
Having no interest in the law its enforcement would
be difficult, for Americans even on juries resent par
tial and class legislation. The people would not re
spect a law which, furnishes the spectacle of well
equipped sportsmen from the, town roaming the
fields and beating the cover for game which . is
denied to the use of the public.
This State has the best facilities for the permanent
preservation and supply of game that can be found
on the continent, because more than half its area,
being mountainous, will never be permanently inhab
ited, and if protected from fire will always offer ade
quate cover. Therefore we agree with all that is said
in favor of strict and wise game laws strictly enforced.
"|~^OR the great value of many of its statements
M and for the frankness of it all we are glad to
(f publish the letter of Game Warden Welch.
He is entirely in error, however, as to the position
of The CalL We can see no propriety in destroying
game that is in stock in' the normal course of. business
at the end of the open season. It is a waste of food
and a loss to the dealer. Nor do we believe that the
same date for an open season is applicable to ..the
whole State, for it finds birds and deer in one section
nesting and rutting, and unfit for food, while in other
sections they have passed into the state of edibility
and may be taken for the only purpose for which they
should ever be killed, for hitman food. It is a ques
tion for further consideration whether these features
in the law are corrigible under our constitution. .By
reason of varying altitude California has the physi
cal differences and conditions that by latitude on a
level reach from the_ Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic
circle. Naturalists readily understand what this means
as-to the conditions of animal and vegetable life.

An army of workmen was busy at the
Pavilion yesterday at the task of clearing
the building of its thirty booths, miles of
bunting and 9000 chairs used by the Ep
worth League Convention last week. The
scene Was a busy one and contrasted sor
rowfully -with the work of upbuilding
which was iri progress a few days ago.
The headquarters of the general com
mittee on the second floor facing on Lar
kin street was shorn of its furniture and
gaudy trappings by a force of laborers
during the morning. The Epworth colors
and league devices, the miles of gay red,
white and yellow bunting that adorned
the reception, entertainment and registra
tion booths were torn down, leaving grin
ning skeletons of frail woodwork exposed.
The mission booths and quarters occupied
by, the county exhibits in the gallery were
similarly treated by the matter-of-fact
workers.
Under the direction of the decoration
committee the strings of flags and league
colors which fluttered gayly for one week
along Market street were removed. Be
fore noon the streets had lost their holi
day aspect and San Francisco assumed Its
former businesslike look. By to-morrow
every sign of the Epworth League will
have been removed.
The publication by The Call of tha
facts in the case of Rev. R. I* Sprin
kle, the minister and a league
delegate, now lying at the Bellevue
Sanitarium, a 'Victim of inflammatory
rheumatism, has excited general interest
among the local Methodist clergy, and it
goes without saying that he Â¦will not be
allowed to suffer. The matter has been
reported to the Masonic relief board and
steps will be taken to relieve his necessi
ties. ,
The various exhibitors at the Pavilion
last week are confident that the State will
reap unlooked-for benefits by reason of
the convention having been held here.
Among the leaguers here were several
merchants with capital. All of them left
orders for goods manufactured here, as
well as for fruits of all kinds. Not a few
have announced their intention of making
this city their home in the near future.

Water Front Notes.
Captain Hills of the steamer Glenlochy
Is a very sick man. He is suffering from
locomotor ataxia and has not been ashore
since the vessel reached port. ; He was
here last in 1838, and commanded -the
Glengyle when that vessel made a number
of trips to the Orient for the Pacific Mail
Captain Pritchard of the British ship
Glenesslin is waiting patiently for. the
Haddon Hall to arrive from Liverpool.
His brother, whom he has not seen for
twenty-one years, is in command of that
vessel, and he expects ! to have a few
weeks in port with him. The Haddon
Hall is now out 164 days and should get in
any time. .
The steamship St. Paul goes on the dry
dock to-day for a cleaning and overhaul
ing. She will sail again for Nome the lat
ter part of the week.
A. Cunningham, a sailor on the river
steamer Columbia, fell overboard Tuesday

assistance. Cunningham was pulled out
more dead than alive. '
The scow schooner Emily Martin went

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
BOUND FOR THE GOLD FIELDS.
p*TT*^ HE schooner Muriel of Hind. Rolph
I e Â¦ & Co.'s fleet has just completed a
I record round trip to the Siberian
H ccast. Â»?he sailed from litre on
May 2 for Petropaulovski and ar
rived there June 6, making the run in
thirty-six days. After discharging and
taking In ballast the Muriel sailed for
Puget Sound, where she arrived on June
19, thus making the round trip in two
months and a halfâ a splendid perform
ance.
The barkentine Behring sailed from here
on April 20 for Petropaulovski, and as her
cargo was wanted first the Muriel was
held here until May 2 eo as to give the
barkentine a good start. When Captain
Weikunder sailed for the Amoor Kiver
there was still no sign of the Behring, and
so far her arrival has notjbeen reported.
The chances are that she nas arrived and
the steamers from Petropaulovski for Ja
pan have failed. to report her. .... ,
The Muriel is a four-masted schooner
and was built in San Francisco. She is
one of the fastest vessels of her class
afloat, and rarely or ever makes a long
passage. She is now loading at Port
Blakeley for this port.

Nczv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The dullness and the
feebler fluctuations in prices in to-day's stock
market reflects the flagging of speculative in
terest which is usual after an active specula
tive movement has expended itself and has been
followed by reaction. By this morning the fact
had become quite obvious that yesterday's vio
lent recovery in the prices of stocks had been
principally based on the relapse in the grain
crops. The consequence of this revised view of
yesterday's movement was some renewed mis
givings lest yesterday's report of benefit from
rains had been overstated. These misgivings
were accentuated by published estimates from
exhaustive Inquiry showing heavy damage al
ready Inflicted upon the corn crop. The sharp
opening declines, however, met considerable
effective support and substantial rallies fol
lowed. The weakness was again renewed in
the stock market when the grain markets
opened and showed notable strength, both for
corn and wheat, the resulting declines In stocks
exceeding those at the opening and extending
from the grangers into other portions of the
railroad list. The tendency of stocks to rally
from declines showed the growth of a feeling
among the speculators that, even conceding sub
stantial damage to the corn crop, the decline
already effected In prices In stocks has fairly
discounted this damage. Another party argues
that prices of stocks are still unduly high com
pared with previous years, notwithstanding the
wide declines that have occurred from the
year's high level. Thus there fs room afforded
for two contending parties In the speculation
and the irregular fluctuations In prices, which
constitute what Is called a traders' market.
Money market considerations again loom Into
some prominence as a factor In the activity of
speculation. It Is realized that the heavy liqui
dation in stocks of the last few days had In
view preparation to meet the crop moving re
quirements and not renewed speculation. The
transfer of funds from Xew York through de
posits at the Sub-Treasury is the signal fhat
crop requirements have begun. The necessity
must therefore be recognized of adjusting spec
ulative demands upon the money market to this
prior and more urgent requirement. The lack
of definite conviction regarding the outlook was
evident from the confused and irregular move
ment of prices. An attempt was evident to lead
an upward movement by bidding up of Union
Pacific and the Wabash issues and there was
some show of firmness among the Southern
roads and seaboard soft coal carriers. But the
market yielded at last to renewed weakness
when the room traders attempted to take their
profits and the lowest prices for the grangers
and Pacifies were made slightly before the
close, which was feverish and irregular. At the
lowest the declines were: Missouri Pacific, 3%;
St. Paul. 3%; Union Pacific. 3U: Atchison. 2%;
Kansas and Texas preferred. 2Â«; while in the
general list declines of 1 to 2 points were very
general. Total sales, 500,000 shares:
The railroad bond market was dull and heavy.
Total sales, par value, $1,315,000.

Boston Â¦ Wool Market.
BOSTON. July 24.â The American Cotton
and AVool Reporter will say to-morrow:
The wool market has continued active and
strong. Fine wools are tending upward and
the strength of the situation is intensified by
the report that prices at tho London sales have
hardened still further. The mills are well em
ployed and the prospects are for a good light
weight season. Both the large and small mills
have been" buying and the business of the past
week has been more generally distributed than
previously. There Is still free buying of wools
in Montana, although the excitement is less
pronounced than It was at one time and the
buyers in some instances have slightly reduced
their limits. The present month will prac
tically wind up the season In Montana and in
dications are that the great bulk of the clip
will have been, purchased' outright.
The sales for the week In Boston amounted
to 6.093,000 pounds domestic and 475.000 pounds'
foreign, making a total of 6.750,000 pounds,
against a total of 6.960.000 pounds for tho pre
vious week and -a total- of 6,347,000 pounds for
the corresponding week last year.
The sales since January 1 amount to 128,3-42.
600 pounds, against 74.2S2.600 pounds for the
corresponding time last year. . â¢

firm, with a further advance, in futures at

In France.'
Chicago was very unsettled, rising from 7096c
to 73c, declining to 71V&C, recovering to 72%c and
falling back to 72%c. There was no rain of any
consequence anywhere, which caused renewed
excitement in all markets. Predictions of pos
sible showers and cooler weather in the North
west gave the market an easier feeling toward
the close, and 'the feeling was -that with more
favorable weather the current advance has
been sufficient.
The damage in the Northwest, however, Is
reported serious.. The crop there is estimated
at 200,000.000, bushels. The Northwest and
Southwest are both buying. France bought
liberally in New York and at St. Louis.
The San Francisco market was stiff, and fu
tures recovered the ground lost on the preced
ing day. Spot prices stood the same.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The situation was rather clearer yesterday.
Owing to, the notices sent out to 'the growers
by the commission men receipts fell off sharp
ly, and as most of the merchants preferred to
drive a truck themselves than to allow even
a load of fruit to go to waste the goods that
came in were got off the wharves as a rule
The canners also succeeded in getting some
supplies. To-day, it is expected that no fruit
of any consequence will bo received, as tho
shipping trade will be worked from interior
points as far as possible. Most of the fruit
still left on tho wharves comes under the head
of swill, ' having been there for several days 'â¢
Under the current conditions quotations are
largely nominal. Peaches are the chief suffer
ers from the strike and are especially weak.
Plums . and Prunes hold un remarkably well
and Bartlett -Pears- show no decline.' Prices for

were awarded second and the Chicago

most' unique display in. the pageant.
The parade waa by all odds the most
beautiful and successful of its kind ever
seen in Milwaukee. Fully. 5000 Elks took
part. It was made up of seven different
divisions. About fifty lodges from all
parts of the country took part. Half of
those brought bands of music, which pre
ceded the marchers.
The Grand Rapids Elks were attired in
new white and navy blue sailor suits and
large black neckties and wore white caps
which bore the name of their city on the
hatband. They also wore white shoes.
This delegation numbered 218 men.
The "Cotton Pickers" from Greenville,

darkles, were a feature In their unique
outfit. They had a wagon, on which were
several bales of cotton fresh from the
fields. A fire run and contests were the
features to-night and were followed at
midnight by a "ghost parade," in which
many took part. The costumes were of a
grewsome order, the skull and crossbones
playing a prominent part In their make

NETV YORK. July 24.â Late this after
noon It was discovered that several of
the suspension rods of the north cable o?
the Brooklyn bridge were broken. The
damage was small, but it caused a fu
ror for a time.
Some excited person circulated a report
that the bridge waa In a dangerous state
and an order to suspend traffic ..wn the
structure waa issued through the office of
the Commissioner of Bridges, police re
serves were called out and presently tho
crowd of Brooklynltea and other resi
dents of Long Island which daily
throngs the Manhattan end of tho bridge
at 6 o'clock were thrown into much ex
citement.
Tho car service was stopped altogether,
aa was the driving of all vehicles. Pedes
trians were, however, allowed to walk to
the Brooklyn side along the promenade.
Tho congestion on the Manhattan side
was relieved by this permission, but the
Brooklyn ferries carried thousands more
than they usually do.
When tho brldgo and Brooklyn Rapid
Transit Company authorities found how
greatly the damage had boen. exaggerated
the traffic waa partly resumed. By 0
o'clock the bridge cars wero running once
more.
Chief Engineer Probasco of tho Depart
ment of Bridges said to-night that to
morrow all tmitle would bo resumed, and
that tho broken rods would bo replaced in
two or three daya. Tho breakage, ho said,
wns due to expansion, presumably from
tho heat.

SERIOUS ILLNESS
OF EDWASD H. SHELDON
Worthington Is popular around the yel
low building, as he has . distinguished
himself as a gentleman from his first ap
pointment with the company. He is looked
upon as a coming man in railroad circles
by his friends, and they predict that now
that he has a good chance to show his
ability he will go right to the front. He
leaves for Tucson to take up his new
work In a few days.
Worthington succeeds Epes Randolph,
the latter accepting a position as man
ager of the street car system of Los An
geles.
in his office, every day he received re
ports of the different trains, both freight
and -passenger. 'and he was able at- a
glance to tell how much freight had come
over the road and the amount that every
individual train carried. His position was
most responsible and he took a great In
terest in it. Hays was impressed with
Worthington's ability when he first met
him. and many times the new president
sent for him and sought information from
him in reference to the workings of the
road. â¢*;" .
B- A. WORTHINGTON is hereby
'-. appointed superintendent . of
the Tucson division.'" Thus
i 3 reads the first official circular
issued by J. M. Herbert, the
new general manager of the Pacific sys
tem of the Southern Pacific. With Worth
ington's appointment the new policy of
the company is illustrated. It shows that
good men who understand the railroad
business, who are young and active, will
not only still retain their positions, but
will be promoted.
With the changes under the Hays ad
ministration a cry went up that the new
president had no use. for Western men
and that he was going to bring cut his
own friends from the East and place
them in good T)ositionp. Such is not' the
case, however. Worthlngton up to the
lime of his present appointment was in
charge of the tonnage rating of locomo

To August Hinrichs, the accomplished
conductor of Fischer's, the artists now in
possession of the popular concert house
will give a benefit performance next Tues
day evening. Ampng the unique features
will be a one-act opera by the eminent
Danish composer August Enna, and in
addition an excellent programme will be
given. Seats for the performance are
now on sale at the box office of Fischer's.
The Chutes and zoo will have the
usual amusing "amateurs'" bill this

Miss Lilian Levey and Arthur Parent,
two clever young vaudeville artists, are to

Parent has won favor as a singer and
dancer. Both are graceful cakewalkers,

PITTSBURG, Mass., July . 23,-The
prosecution rested this afternoon in the
trial of Robert H. Fosburg for the alleged
killing of his sister. May. The conclusion
was as sudden as it was unexpected, j It
being known that there were witnesses
held in reserve, a number having been
summoned by the prosecution only yes
terday. â¢ . . Â¦ . .
The defendant's junior, counsel set forth
the facts upon which the: defense Is
based. There was a sensation, at the
opening of the court this morning when
Judge Stevens ordered the expulsion i of
several representatives of the New York
papers because of an article which had
been published In regard to an alleged
episode at the grave of the victim of the
tragedy. * â¢ â¢â¢ - Â¦ . â¢ â¢ . . Â¦â¢ .. : .

edy, and Â¦who had- found the single shoe
which- has figured .as ,a portion of. the
Government's chain of evidence.. was also
a witness to-day. .: â¢'â¢ ;â¢ .--
At the conclusion of .the Government's

NEWPORT, R. I., July 24.â While heavy
gun practice was going on at Fort Adams
this afternoon several pieces of shell
went Â¦ whizzing up one of Newport's
streets, but no serious damage was done.
Officers at the fort say that the pieces
were not from, shells used by them, but
the fact remains that the shell fragments
dropped into the town.
It was about 5 o'clock when persons in
the vicinity of the City Hall heard a
whizzing sound in the air. This was fol
lowed by the falling of a limb of a tree
in front of the public building and. then
a piece of projectile was seen. to graze
along the side of the stone building, mak
ing a cut in the stone as clean as if work
ed with a chisel. At the same time a tree
a little farther up the street was struck
by another piece of projectile. Â¦ The piece
that struck the City Hall landed beneath
the window of the office of the Board of
Health.
Just previous to the incident the report
of one of the guns at the fort was heard.
On inquiry at the fort it was learned that
firing was being done with the 10-lnch dis
appearing guns that guard the entrance
to Narragansett Bay, and that the charge
used in the shells was simply a reduced
charge of eighty pounds as a preliminary
test for trials to-morrow with the full
charges of 280 pounds.
When told that the City Hall had been
struck a non-commissioned officer said it
would be impossible for a piece of the
shell used at the fort to burst, as no
bursting charge was used. There had
been more or less saluting from warships
in the harbor all- afternoon, but there waa
none being done at that time. This even
ing one piece of shell was found. It look
ed like a part of one-pounder ammunition.

SAN JOSE. July 24.â Charges of derelic
tion of duty and the squandering of funds
of the estate of Minerva M. Wheelock, de
ceased, .have been made against Andrew
J. Clunle of San Francisco, G. M. Bruce
and M. M. Bruce, executors of the estate,'
by the Erring Woman's Refuge of Chi
cago. This society Is a beneficiary under
the will of deceased to the amount of
$100,000, and from the petition filed it ap
pears it has never received its bequest.
Mrs. Wheelock died in this city on. May
I. 1893, leaving an estate valued at $100,000.
Shortly , afterward the executors took
charge of tho estate.
The petitton filed In Judge Rhodes' court
to day by the Erring Woman's Refuge
states, that the executors have been dere
lict in their duties; that more than.$10.
000 has come into their hands since July
II, 1893, and no account has been tiled as
to the distribution of tho funds; further,
that this amount has been dissipated and
is not now In the hands of th>< executors.
It Is. declared that at the time of the
admission of the will to probute the ex
ecutors were required to give bonds in the
aum of $33,000 oaoli, and that these bonds
nro wholly inadequuto and irresponsible
financially. Since the appointment of the
executors one of them, G. M. Bruce, has
died and no ono has been appointed in
hiH place,
The potitton nsksi that tho executors
bo forthwith required to fllo an account
of their proceedings and of all moneys
received nna disposed of in tho estate,
nndthnt on failure to* do ho tho letturi
testamentary b* revoked nnd Bomo aulta-
I'lo pernon be directed to tnko charge of
the estuto and tho moots thereof. Tho
court is asked to compel tho reimUnlnR
oxututors, A. J. Clunlc and M. M. Bruce,
to give new bonds in tho sum of $3K,ooij
each.
Judge nhodes made an order for tho ex
ecutors to fllo an account,, together wltn
vouchers, before August 7, together with u
how bond in tho sum of $33,000 ench, and
thst on August 0 they anall uppenr In
court and show cause why the letters ls
sutu to them shull not be revoked.
Andrew J. Clunio, who Is named as 'one
of the defendants in the 8an Jose suit,
was seen at his residence in this city last
night.
"This suit," he said, "is 'nothing more
or less than the outcome of a kick on the
purt of a man named Beggs, who is at the
head of the Erring Woman's Refuge of
Chicago, because the executors were not
in a position soon .enough to pay off a
legacy left the refuge by Minerva Wheel
ock. The delay in paying off legacies has
been due to the fact that the probate of
the Minerva Wheelock estate has had to
wait for the probate of the estate of O. L.
Wheelock. the deceased husband of the
aforesaid Minerva Wheelock. The bulk of
the O. L. Wheelock estate is embodied- in
real estate in Chicago. Realty -values in
Chicago have been at a low ebb lately
and therefore the executors have been
holding off In the hope of getting a better
price before soiling. This is not only the
judgment of the executors, but also the
request of the heirs. The Erring Wo
man's Refuge is a beneficiary under
Minerva Wheelock's will and not the O.
L. Wheelock estate. So far we have been
able to pay, off only one-sixth of " the
Minerva Wheelock estate to the heirs. Th's
latter have all expressed themselves as
satisfied with the administration of., tho
estate. This outsider, Beggs, seems to-be
the only kicker." . Â¦ .â¢â¢ Â¦ Â¦ " -Â¦'

C0NSTITUTION
AGAIN A VICTOR
NEW LONDON. Conn., July 24.â In a
fine southwest breeze over thÂ» thlrty-nine
mile course from New Haven Breakwater
to. Sarahs Ledge at the mouth of New
London harbor the Constitution again
showed what a superb racing craft she Is
in light -weather and smooth water. She
beat the Columbia to-day eight minutes
and twenty-three seconds fairly and
squarely. There were no flukes, the wind
holding true and steady, with the excep
tion of a shift of a couple of points after
two-thirds of the distance had been cov
ered. The breeze at no time was of suffi
cient strength to raise a single whitecap
on the waves.
.The race between the two 90-footers was
contested every inch. After going along
for two or three miles they Indulged in a
luffing match. In which the Constitution
came out a winner, obtaining a lead of
nearly a quarter of a mile. At 12:30 the
Constitution had gone about fifteen miles.
Soon after she set her spinnaker to star
board, carrying It until Cornfield light
ship was reached, when it was taken in
again for a few minutes and then reset
for the run to the finish.
The Constitution kept a mile closer to
the Long Island shore than her rival until
Bartletts Reef was reached and she fin
ished a good mile in the lead, having gone
the thirty-nine miles in four hours thirty
two minutes and twenty-seven seconds
while it took the Columbia to go' over the
same distance four hours forty minutes
and fifty seconds. This was remarkably
fast when the comparative lightness of
the breeze is taken Into consideration, and
also that the tide was against them over
the greater part of the course.
Yachtsmen are now convinced that the
Constitution is faster than the -Columbia
on every point of sailing in light weather,
but in a heavy blow and a rough and
tumbling sea many believe that the Co
lumbia will prove tho speedier. Summary

islation In regard to the notification of
the authorities of the existence of tuber
culosis and the disinfection and salu
brlety of hotels, railroad cars and steam
boats, thus preventing the spread of tu
berculosis. Â¦
Professor Brouardel. who Is dean of the
medical faculty of Paris, maintained that
the disease was curable. He said any
measure tending to limit the ravages of
alcoholism would diminish the mortality
from consumption, and referred to the
great danger of hawking pieces of meat
in public places and in the sale of milk
which had not been examined. He be
lieved these dangers could be remedied by
legislation. Professor Brouardel compli
mented the United States on its "realiza
tion of the dangers of expectoration and
on its legislation in the matter."
Professor Brouardel declines to accept
Professor Koch's theory that tuberculosis
cannot be propagated by the meat and
milk of tuberculous cattle, and said he
thought It right to protect the population
from tills contagion by legislation. V
In an important paper on the question
of tuberculosis. Dr. G. A. Herron of Lon
don paid a warm tribute to the researches
of Professor Koch. He said that the
prejudice against tuberculin arose from
the ignorance of those who had attempted
to use it, while disregarding the explicit
Injunctions of the discoverer, particularly
in applying it In unsuitable . cases. He.
pointed out that a very frequent mistake
was to administer an overdose and to fail
to reduce or suspend the application when
the temperature rose above the normal.
The only chance to cure consumption.
Dr. Herron asserted, was to begin In the
early stages. The surest method of
diagnosis was by the application of tuber
culin. He expressed himself as entirely
confident that this could be done with ab
solute safety. "Had tuberculin served no
other purpose than diagnosis," said he.
"it would be worthy of the highest praise
and appreciation."
Professor Koch, who was present, was
warmly cheered. He spoke briefly, in
dorsing Dr. Herron's observations as to
the necessity for caution in the use of
tuberculin. . - ',
At a banquet given to-night to Professor
Koch, Sir James Crlchton Browne an
nounced that the British authorities had
appointed a committee to Inquire into the
relations between human and bovine
tuberculosis.

AN OILY HABIT.
There are people who become uncon-
sdouEly addicted to the butter habit: that
is to eay, they like butter and gradually
cat a little more as the months go by,
until they find they have consumed each
meal quite a quantity of fat. that they
have not vitality enough to properly di-
pest.
This indigested substance causes more
or lees catarrh of the stomach and trouble
with the bowels.
The remedy, of court*, is to largely cut
Cown the allowance of butter and for two
or three nights sup nearly a quart of very
hot water, just before grofngr to bed. This
washes out the ftomach and bowels and
gives them renewed vitality. Then ths

be called upon to assist the teamsters
and none can tell where the struggle will

This action was uniooked for on the
part of the Brotherhood of Teamsters, for
it has been maintained by the executive
officers that the men were locked out and
did not intend to strike. This action indi
cates that other measures may be taken
to .settle the controversy, but how far

Outside of a few foolish demonstrations
by ovcrzqalous .teamsters, the day passed
quietly. Although Business Agent Casey
announced on Tuesday night that out of

situation yesterday by the refusal of the

explanations to offer.
"We told those fruit men we would han

to the conclusion we could not do so with
justice to ourselves. The reasons for this
we are not ready to disclose."

McLaughlin of the Brotherhood of Teamsters th?.t all the men re
maining at work, with the exception of those employed by the Pa

MORE TEAMSTERS 'WILL QUIT THIS MORNING
INTEREST in the local labor contro
versy now centers Itself around the
possible action to be taken by the
members of the Car Employes' Union.
A strike is scheduled for Friday or
Saturday. As was printed exclusively in
The Call, some twenty-five men connected
with the various branches of the road
were discharged last week. Manager Vin
ing had a conference with the men on last
.Monday, and they were ordered to report
for work, but as yet have not secured
their old runs.
The matter has since been called to the
attention of the union and in the absence
of ai;y regular meeting a round robin
has been sent' out. In order to strengthen
the cause of the conductors and gripmen,'
the engineers, fireman and others em
ployed in the car Louses have joined
hands. The latter body of workers is
newly organized, but is strong, and as the
men Â«-HI have the support of their na
tional organization an i the "sympathy of
affiliated bodies throughout the State,
they are prepared to insist upon a com
pliance with their demands. The new
strike order will go into effect either at
noon to-morrow or at the same hour on
Saturday. A sympathetic strike is looked
for in;the cities adjacent to the bay.
The organization of the car employes
embraces nearly every man connected
with' the Market-street system, either as
conductor, gripmau.. motorman. engineer,
fireman or laborer. The organization also
embraces the wime class of men on the
rabl*-, electric and liorse car lines not affil
iated with the Market-street pyptoni

MEET HIS EMPLOYES
V. Pisa, a gunsmith whose place of
business is at 320 Broadway, had an ex
perience yesterday with a dangerous ap
paratusâa shell-loading machine. That'
he was not killed in an explosion that
wrecked a portion of the interior of his
shop and shattered it's windows, as well
as those In adjoining buildings, seems
miraculous. He was seated at tho ma
chine loading cartridges when the powder
chamber exploded, but walked out of
the ruin well and sound, except for a few
minor cutsand bruises.
Pisa was at work feeding powder Into
the empty shells. He had a number of
them already loaded, on a shelf near by,'
when one for some unknown reason ex
ploded. The concussion caused the powder
in tho chamber on the machine to ignite
and Instantly there was a deafening report
and the room filled with smoke. Pisa was
knocked to the floor, but to his surprise
found that ho had not been injured. As
soon as tho smoke cleared 1 away ho
walked to the door and met a large crowd
that had been attracted by the noise, and
then surveyed the wreck of his shop.
Tools had been scattered about in dis
order and woodwork shattered. The iron
of the machine was twisted and separated
and windows were broken. The shock
shook -buildings In the neighborhood and
glass in an adjoining store was also
cracked, -v. â¢ ' \ Â¦
A queer-looking contrivance found in
the 'doorway of the saloon of Thomas' F.
Hayden at .Broadway and Kearny street
was turned over to the police yesterday
morning and will be examined by experts.
Captain of Police Wittman has possession
of the supposed infernal machine and aa
yet has no report as to its contents.
The contrivance' was found yesterday
morning by Hayden and John Torrato. a
cigar dealer in the neighborhood, shortly
after 10 o'clock near the doorway of the
saloon. Thinking it might have been left
by somebody and would be taken away
again, they allowed it to remain where it
was found for two hours. No claimant,
however, appeared and the finders carried
it to the counter, where they . made a
hasty examination of it.
1 The box in which the mystery is in
closed is covered with wires. When the
top was unscrewed two small sticks
wrapped in glazed paper were discovered.
It is thought that these may be dynamite
or some high explosive. They were sur
rounded by cotton saturated with some
moist substance, and 'the wires from the
outside '-.of the box connected with them.
Hayden at once notified Captain Witt
man and the machine was transferred to
his office. It was later turned over to ex
perts and an examination will be made.
owners of the teams are holding the
reins, not being able to secure competent
help. We can never afford to surrender
our rights and allow others to dictate our
business to us. We can never treat with
-the brotherhood. â¢ When we hire a man
at ?.T or $3 50 a day, we consider that we
have a perfect right to say where, when
and for whom he shall work. In regard
to the brotherhood's offer to allow their
men to 'return to Â¦work on condition that
they be not required to haul for the Mor
ton Drayage Company I will say that we
cannot possibly become a party to any
such an agreement.
"The- major portion of the union drivers
are already dissatisfied with their en
forced Idleness. Just as soon as we are
able to assure the teamsters that they
w'll be amply protected while performing
their work, they will return to. work."
Additional police were on duty all dur
ing: the day, 'and in guarding the teams
that were running succeeded In relieving
In a measure the glut of freight that ac
cumulated.
A dispatch from Petaluma says: /
"Several experienced teamsters from
local transfer companies leave to-morrow
to enter the employ of McNab & Smith
during the strike. They are offered wages
of $12 a day.
"The strike has greatly Interfered with
shipping all along- the line of the Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway. The com
pany will not take carload lots and sldlngd
and warehouses are stocked with the
large crop of hay. The egg and produce
expressage from this city has been great
ly hampered." , i
It is not probable that the drayage com
panies are offering ?12 a day to teamsters,
as there are enough unemployed local
men to till all places at the regular union
schedule of wages.
A Tew Teamsters Desert.
Despite the fact that great crowds of
the strikers congregated all day yesterday:
along the water front, not the least dis
turbance occurred. As on the preceding
day a few teamsters i were induced to
desert their wagons after .they had
reached the wharf with loads of mer
chandise. This was due entirely to peace
ful persuasion. '
AVhila a large truck belonging to F.
H. Hammer & Co.. shipping and commis
sion merchants at 215-217 Davis street, was
being transported to this city yesterday
afternoon on one of the Oakland boats,
some one unscrewed the nuts from the
rear wheels. , As soon' as the truck
reached this side of the bay and wad
being rolled down East street one of the
wheels came off, disabling the truck, at
the. corner of Mission and'Kast streets, on
the Mission-street car track. A large
crowd soon gathered around the broken
vehicle but not a single person assisted
the teamster to replace tho wheel. The
truck resting on the ear track caused a
Borious blockade of the street cars and
a considerable portion of tho traffic In
the neighborhood.
