IT.in bow an undisputed fact that
Czolg-osz, the assassin of President
MeKinley. was In California during
the Presidential visit. Yesterday It
was discovered that Czolgosz -was In
San Francisco and received mail at
the general delivery window : at : the
main postofflce on a number- of occasions.
The discovery of the fact that the assas
sin was here at that time is due .to the
article published yesterday in The Call, it
announcing that Czolgosz under the name
of Fred Neiman had paid visits . to the
postoffice in Pacific Grove while the Presi
dent was at that place.
Clerk W. E. Reed, who delivered the
letters here, is very positive that he can
not have made any mistake. He declares:
that Czolg-osz called repeatedly for mail.
Reed has been a clerk in the general de
livery department for nineteen years.* His
description of Neiman coincides with the
telegraphic accounts of Czolgosz, with the
exception that the- man who got the let
ters from Reed was much stouter than
the murderer of the President is de
scribed to be. That Czolgoez is much
lighter now than when he was In San
Francisco is easily accounted for by. the
fact that the weather, in . the Bast has
been extremely hot and the. 'assassin may,
as has nearly every one in*the East, lost
considerable weight during the hot spell.
When Czolgosz came to California has
not yet been discovered. It is, presumed
that he traveled from town to^ town. fol r
lowing the President and ' coldbloodedly
awaiting a favorable opportunity to as
eaesinate him. s . . â¢ - . : .

SACRAMENTO. Sept 16.-ThÂ«
Board of Directors of the Cali
fornia State Agricultural Society
adopted resolutions to-day on the
death of President McKinley.
The resolutions place the respon
sibility for the dastardly crime
which deprived the" nation of one of Its
best Presidents' upon the attacks made
upon public men by the yellow press. They
follow: . -
The board of directors of the California State
Agricultural Society have learned with deep
est sorrow of the death of the President of the
United States, William McKinley. In his Ufa
is exemplified the career of a true American,
and the success that can follow the exertions
of . even the humblest child of America. As
a boy, respectful to his parents and obedient
to their teachings: as a soldier., brave and
patriotic; as a citiaen, honest, and enterpris
ing; as Congressman and as. Governor of hia
native State of Ohio, displaying such rare
qualifications for public Service that his ele
vation to the position- of Chief Magistrate of
the nation was but the â¢ natural sequence of
the years of his life. > Â¦ Â¦
His management of the vast business of our
great country for the past four and a half
years has been so wise as to procure the
plaudits of his political enemies, actuated as
it has been by the purest motives and dominat-'
ed at all times by the central thought that
America and American Interests would be ad
vanced and protected. , .. Â¦ Â¦Â¦- â¢
His private life was a model; a dutiful son.
a lovingf husband and an - upright man. He
proved that a man in this free government
could be a Christian statesman. . .,
His murder' shocks the senses of all the
people of all the world, not merely- by reason
of the cowardly assassination, but -because ot
all men In ! public office in this or any other
land. William McKinley had been the friend
of the poor, the champion of the oppressed,
the one man that even the ' wicked anarchists
should have spared. . jÂ£ ~
"We bow. In the last words TaOhlm whose
memory we -honor, to the ' wtlt?W God, but
our sorrow is great and our country suffers.
His murder was the direct result of
permittlngrtlie advocates "of ; anarchy
"and opposition to .law and' order to
poison the minds and inflame the pas
sions of the people by verbal and
printed attacks upon public men.
"We tender the widow and relatives of the
martyred President our heartfelt sympathy,
but bid them be of good cheer in thq certainty
that though dead in flesh, the spirit of William
McKinley will ever be in the hearts of his
countrymen, ' and that he is receiving now/
from the ruler of the universe the reward \p
heaven for bis good deeds on earth.

BUFFALO, . Sept. 16.â Leon F.
Czolgosz, alias Fred Xeiman,
was indicted to-day by the
County Court Grand Jury for
murder in the first degree, for
fatallv shooting President Mc-
Kinley at the Temple of Mu
sic of the Pan-American Exposition at
4:15 o'clock on the afternoon of Septem
ber 6. .
When arraigned before Judge Edward
K. Emery in the county court the prison
er stubbornly refused to answer questions
repeatedly asked of himby District At
torney Penney as to whether he had coun
sel or wanted counsel. The District,At
torney then suggested that, inasmuch as
the defendant refused to answer, counsel
should be assigned.'
Witnesses Who Testify.
Judge Emery assigned Loraine L. Lewis
and Kobert C. Titus, former Supreme
Court Justices, of this city, whose names
had been suggested' by . the Erie County
Bar Association.
Czolgosz probably will be arraigned
again to-morrow morning to plead to the
indictment. . -
District Attorney Penney presented the
evidence in the murder case to the Grand
Jury. . v.
Aside from the Â§urgeons and physicians
in the case no witnesses were sworn other
than those who were in the ! Temple oT
Music and witnessed the ' sh'ootlng. The.
complete list of witnesses in the order
in wnicn they -appeared to testify follows:
L>r. Herman Mynter, Dr. M. K. Gayior,
Dr. H. CJ. Matzinger, Dr. M. D. Manti,
Secret Service Detective Gallagher, At
torney James L.. Quackenbush, Attorney
Louis L. Babcock, Harry Rlnshaw, Gap

K. C Knapp, llrs. Vandenborgh Davris,
John Branca, a colored porter; Captalu

Superintendent Bull and Assistant Super
intendent P. V. Cusack of the local police
department; Fred Leigh ter, Charles J.
Ciose. .Exposition Guards Westenfelder
and James, Detectives Geary and Bolo
man of this city.
At 4:15 o'clock this afternoon, just ex
actly ten days after the shooting, the
cirand Jury voted unanimously to indict
Czolgosz for murder in the first degree.
At, 4:41 the indictment was presented to
Judge Kmery in the county court.
Courtroom Is Crowded.
Then ensued a wait of an hour. The
rumor that the murderer Â¦was to be ar
raigned spread and in a short time the
courtroom was crowded. Great secrecy
was maintained as to the place of con
linement of the prisoner, but it is believed
that he was locKed up in the temporary
jail at the Erie County penitentiary, where
prisoners have been kept while the jail
has been undergoing repairs. After the
indictment was reported the prisoner was
driven from the penitentiary, a mile from
the City Hall, to the jail across the street
lrom the hall.
Czolgosz was then taken under a strong
guard from the jail through the tunnel
under Delaware avenue to the basement
of the City Hail and up the stairs to the
courtroom on the second floor.
The prisoner was shackled to a detec
tive and another detective held his other
arm. Assistant Superintendent Cusack
marching in front and a number of'patrol
men behind. When the prisoner was tak
en before the bench the crowd from the
courtroom surged about him on all sides.
They were compelled to resume their
teats.
Czolgosz is of medium height, of fairly
good build and has light, curly hair, but
a ten days* growth of beard on his face
pave him an unkempt appearance. Ap
parently he feigned Insanity, not stupid
ity, ana his glance roamed aooui, but his
eyes were always downcast. Not once
did he look the county prosecutor or the
Judg-e In the face.
"Czolgosz, have you got a lawyer? Do
you wish a lawyer? You have been in
dicted for murder In the first degree. Do
you want a lawyer to defend you? Czol
cosz, look at me and answer."
District Attorney Penney fired these
questions at the prisoner, his voice rising
with each succeeding question, but Czol
gosz Btubbornly refused to answer. The
District Attorney respectfully suggested
that counsel be assigned to defend the
prisoner and ascertain what he had better
do as to his plea to the indictment before
arraignment.
Counsel Is Appointed.
Judge Emery then asked the" prisoner
before the bar If he hadcounsel.'but there
was no answer, despite the fact that the
police officers told him the Judge was
i-peaking and that he must answer.
The court then said: .: Â¦ , :. â¢.
"Czolgosz, you having appeared for ar
raignment in the court - without counsel,
the law maJces it the duty of: the court to
assign counsel. The Bar Association of
our county has considered the matter and
suggested the names of certain gentlemen
of high character for such assignment.
The court has seriously considered the
question and after much consideration has
concluded to follow the suggestion made

Telegrams from the provinces continue
to furnish worldwide evidence of respect
for the dead President. The Parliament
of New Zealand will adjourn out of re
spect on the day of the funeral.
The Globe ihlnks President Roosevelt
has already, shown -such ability that he
would have succeeded to the Presidency,
in 1905, and Is confident that he will prove
to be a strong and able President.
After alluding to the Alaskan boundary
and Nicaragua canal questions, the paper
asks: "Will his impulsiveness lead. him
to take short cuts that may prove long
and expensive? Time and experience can
alone determine."
"His accession to office is fraught with
great possibilities," says the Westminster
Gazette. "To a great extent a new ele
ment has been brought into the politics of
the world."
By command of King Edward, the union
jack, which floats over the round tower of
Windsor Castle during the absence of the
court, is half masted as a tribute of re
spect to the late President McKinley.
The London Stock Exchange will "be offi
cially closed on Thursday next, the day
of interment of President McKinley at
Canton, OKlo.
Evidences of mourning for President
McKinley are widespread at Cork. The
Lord Mayor of Cork, Sir Daniel Hegarty,
has convened a meeting of the Corpora
tion for September 25, to pass a vote of
sympathy with Mrs. McKinley and the
citizens of the United States.
President Roosevelt's personality 'at

"It would be an unique opportunity,"
the Westminster Gazette says, "of show
ing British sympathy with the United
States, owing to the accidental fact that
the King's son is near at -hand, and it
would, we are sure, be appreciated by the
American people."
The newspapers here continue to express
the hope that the Duke. of Cornwall and
York will be able to attend the funeral of
President McKinley, but it seems now ex
tremely doubtful if it can be arranged,
especially since the ceremonies' at the
Capitol have been fixed for Tuesday. Gov
ernment circles seem to think that direct,
immediate action on the part of King Ed
ward is the only way to bring about the
attendance of the Duke at Washington.

only lights to, be seen were those In the
room where his comrades kept watch over
the dead chief. .
Yesterday the President gathered to
gether some personal friends in Buffalo
and those members of the Cabinet who
were here and gave to them such ideas as
he has already formulated for the conduct
of public affairs and his own policy. In
no sense are they divergent from >. what
has been understood as Mr. McKinley's
policy. This policy, as outlined to his
friends at yesterday's conference, will be

They came to pay their tribute of re

music. Amid the hush of the great

When the sad cortege arrived at the.
White House the hearse stopped under
the porte cochere. The body bearers took
the coffin upon their broad shoulders and
pasSTn? up the three or four steps, waited
until President Roosevelt and tho mem
bers of the Cabinet had alighted from
their carriages and then followed them
through the wide doors Into the east
room. Just in the center of the room,
under the great chandelier, they deposited
their precious burden on a. black draped
base and stood at salute while the -new
Chief Executive and the Cabinet mem
bers with bowed heads passed by. Fol
lowing them came the chiefs of the army

were a half hundred floral emblems, ex
ceptionally beautiful, and * as many more

The carriage containing Mrs. McKinley.
Drs. Rixey and Abner McKinley had pre
ceded the funeral cortege to the White
House by some little time. Dr. Rixey was
the first to alight and then Abner Mc-
Kinley. They tenderly assisted Mrs. Mc-
Kinley to the stairs. With her right arm
resting heavily and wearily upon the
shoulder of her dead husband's brother
and supported on the other side by Dr
Rixey, she walked slowly along into the
house. She was closely veiled, but her
feeble steps told the story of her great
suffering. She was assisted at once to the
elevator and to her old room, and soon
retired. . Dr. Rixey and Mr. Cortelyou

Bugle Sounds "Taps."
Ae the casket emerged a bugle note rose
clearly and taps rang out. That was the
only sound that broke the dead silence.
Just before the entrance to the station
President Roosevelt, with the members of
the Cabinet, had paused and had taken
station so as to leave a broad space for
the funeral cortege. They ranged them
selves on the sidewalk In double rows op
posite each other and stood with bared
heads aa the corpse was carried to the
hearse. The hearse was an exquisitely
carved affair and was drawn by six coal
black horses, each of which was led by a
colored jrroom in black livery.
Just as the body was being placed in
the hearse an Incident occurred that
caused a murmur of disapprobation. A
photographer from a near by window sud

The flashlight and accompanying noise
made people shudder. â¢
President Roosevelt seemed to be mo
mentarily disconcerted. The hearse bear

moved away and was followed at once by
President Roosevelt and those accompany

â¢ General Â¦ s Boyd, â¢ assistant passenger
agent, had personal charge of the train.
The train left Buffalo at 8:30 o'clock this
morning and arrived . at - Washington at
8:33 o'clock to-night. In twelve hours it
is estimated that over half a million peo
ple saw the coffin which held all that was
mortal of President McKinley.
There was no spot of color to catch the
eye on this train of death. The locomo
tive was shrouded in black, the curtains
of the cars in which sat the lonely, strick
en widow, the relatives of the President,
Cabinet and others were drawn. The
whole black train was like a shuttered
house, save only for that hindmost car,
where the body lay guarded by a soldier
of the army and a sailor of the navy. ,
- Mrs. McKinley stood the trip bravely.
In the morning soon after leaving Buffalo
she pleaded so earnestly to be allowed to
go into the car. where her dear one lay
that reluctant consent was given and' she
spent half an hour beside the coffin. All
the way the train was preceded about fif
teen minutes by a pilot engine, sent ahead
to test -the bridges and switches to pre
vent the possibility of an accident to the
precious burden it carried. The train had
the right of way over everything. Not a
wheel moved on the : Pennsylvania Rail

mourning. At all the larger towns and
cities after the train got Into Pennsylva
nia militiamen drawn up at "present

\ "/Silence Is Oppressive.
- The silence with which the countless
thousands viewed the remains of their
hero and martyr was oppressive and pro
found. Only the rumbling of the train's
wheels, the sobs from men and women
with tear-stained faces and the doleful
tolling of the church bells broke upon the
ear. At several places, Williamsport, Har
risburg and Baltimore, the chimes played
Cardinal Newman's grand hymn. Taken
altogether, the' journey home was the
most remarkable demonstration of univer
sal personal sorrow since Lincoln was
borne to his grave. Every one of those
who came to pay the last tribute to the
dead had an opportunity to catch a
glimpse of the' flag-covered bier elevated
in view in the observation car at the rear
of the train. ' â¢- '
The line had begun its march at 7:30.
Half an hour later, with measured step
and to the strains or the constantly play
ing band, the line turned into Exchange
street, where the railroad station 13 lo
lated. As the cortege passed Ellicott
street It was met by the carriage bearing

On the Solemn March.
From the City Hall.
Exactly at the appointed hour, 7:43, the
escort was in perfect readiness. In clar
ion tones Major Mann, commanding the
escort, delivered the order "Present
arms." Noiselessly the arms leaped to
position; the commanding officer turned
about, and. facing the house of the dead,
brought his sword to "present."
A minute of awe-inspiring silence and
then, emerging from the doors 'of the City
Hall, there moved eight body-bearers,
â¢four soldiers and four sailors. On their
shoulders rested the casket Inclosing the
body 'of the country's beloved one.
Away down the line of soldiery from the
Sixty-fifth Regiment band came the
strains of "Nearer, My God, to Thoe."
Behind long ropes the throng uncovered
and, with bowed heads, . waited and
watched in silence. Tenderly the precious
burden was borne slowly down the stone
steps, along the curved approach to the
hearse. The flag-draped casket, was
lifted gently into the hearse and the doors
closed. Through the windows of the
hearse , naught but a mass of flags, sur
mounted by a single sheaf of wheat,
could be seen. In - front came troops
wheeling Into line and' moving down
Franklin street. Once more the strains
of music, this time Chopin's funeral
march, accompanied by the tolling of the
church bells. Behind the troops came the
carriages of the members of the Cabinet.
Then came the hearse and following were
comrades of the Grand Army wit.:i a
company of local militia bringing up the
rear. The cortege passed into Church
street, winding past . St. Paul's Church
into Main street. Down Main street the
procession moved between masses of p?o
ple, all uncovered. The high winds -.from
off Lake Erie snapped and whipped the
bunting and crape . with which every
building was draped. Above the buildings
American flags awl black streamers hung
at half mast. .
and secret service men were near by. Oth
erwise there was nothing to distinguish
the President from any ordinary citizen.
The slow and stately progress of the
President's body from the City Hall to the
railroad station afforded the people at
Buffalo a last opportunity to do honor to
the memory of the lamented executive.
Statue-like, the guard of honor at the
catafalque maintained its position
throughout the long hours . of the nigiit.
There was a sergeant of artillery at the
head of the bier, a marine at the foot. At
one side was a sergeant of infantry, on
the other a marine. It was a few minutes
after 5 o'clock when there came signs of
life from within the corridor, where the
body of William McKinley reposed. The
doors were flung open, the gates swung
ajar. At 7:07 forty sailors from the steam
ship Michigan swung up Franklin street,
the first detachment of the cortege's es
cort. The bluejackets wheeled into line
directly opposite the entrance of the City
Hall. Four minutes later the four-horse
hearse drew up and a company of marines
filed Into position. Five of the Cabinet
officers arrived In Jiwo carriages. The

Then from down the column came the
mournful sound of the "long roll." As it '
ceased there arose, clear and sweet, the
notes of the beautiful hymn, "Nearer, My
God, to Thee." The soldiers raised the
flag-covered casket on their shoulders and
moved toward the train as the band took
up the air of the grand old hymn, "O
God, Our Help In Ages Past." On tha
curb stood President Roosevelt, with Sen
ator Hawley, The former had refused
the advice of the police to move into the
aepot yard and with his hat In his hand
he stood silently watching the body being
removed. General Brooke and his staff
fell in directly behind the casket: then
came the President, Secretary Cortelyou

with his cane for assistance, followed
Senator Hanna, accompanied by his son.

Two series of resolutions, expressing
the sentiments of the assembled represen

presented before the convention held last
night at B'nal B'rlth Hall. Norman W.

It was then unanimously decided to con
fine the exercises to the -Mechanics' Pa
vilion, after W. Greer Harrison had
stated that it would accommodate 14,000
people. Mayor Phelan suggested a change
In. the arrangement of the Pavilion to im
prove the faulty acoustics. . General
Barnes said the acoustics were not- as
poor as generally supposed, and he com
mended tfce selection of the Mechanics'-
Pavilion.
Some of the committeemen favored the
holding of an auxiliary service In Golden-
Gate Park, but no action was taken.
Rolla V. Watt suggested that the
churches be requested to hold services In
the evening, but the committee thought
the churches should not be interfered

Mr. "Weill's suggestion was opposed by
several of the committeemen, as a parade
Â¦was net considered appropriate. General
S. B. M. Young informed the committee
that he had received instructions frcm.
the War Department regarding the man
ner of the -military' celebration. He said
that the instructions comprised the firing
of guns with a parade of the troops on the
parade grounds. General Young said he
could not promise to turn out the United
States soldiers in a general parade. He
opposed the parade proposition on the
ground that it was not an appropriate
manifestation of respect -to â¢ the memory
of the deceased President, and thought
the celebration should be confined to the
memorial exercises. â¢

Calling the meeting to order Mayor
Phelan paid a feeling tribute to the
character and worth of President McICIn
ley, wbo In life had endeared himself to
the people of San Francisco on the occi
6lon of his recent visit.
"The President of the United States has
proclaimed Thursday as a day of gen
eral mourning," said the Mayor, 'and
Governor Gage has designated the same
day a iegal holiday, and it now becomes
our duty to arrange for a memorial cele
bration in which the people as a whole
may take part. Gentlemen, it is now for
you to make suggestions regarding the
character of the services."
Raphael Welll. after a touching refer
ence to the untimely taking off of the
nation's chief executive, urged the com
mittee to arrange for a parade of mourn
ing. He argued that the largest building
In the city was incapable of holding more
than 12,000 persons, and this would neces
sarily exclude many thousands of peo
ple who would wish to testify their grief
at the loss of their beloved ruler. Mr.
Weill favored a magnificent street pa
ceant. In which all the people could be'
represented, in addition to the services in
the largest building that can be pro
cured.

Christian f a3th which was evinced by the
last words of her devoted husband, "It is
Gods way; his will., not ours, be done."
.Notwithstanding the national calamity
that has fallen upop us, the assassin's
hand shall not stay the onward and upward
progress of the republic. Our confidence
remains unshaken In the people and In thÂ©
servants of their choice. Anarchy must.be
allowed no hiding place In this free country,
rpr its aim is the destruction of all govern

would destroy the peace and safety of our
country must be extirpated; no Just concep

Justify, a license the logical result of which
is assassination and murder.

After the reading of -the resolutions
every delegate rose to his. feet and gave
his assent to their adoption. . " , '
Â¦ that forced praise and admiration even from
his political foes.
Wise In council and brave in action, his
loss ' Is an Irreparable one. In him we lose \
the noblest and ablest exponent of our times
of the doctrines and principles of the Kepub

party leader.. He, was a' clear-headed, and,

' :sumed the functions of the highest and most
.'.honorable office In the gift of the > people'
;- f of the United States he became', the devoted

and its welfare," progress and prosperity and
the welfare and prosperity of all Its citi

. chief care and purpose. â¢ ' '
Â¦ Â¦ Therefore, be it resolved that 1 in this the
nation's creat bereavement Â¦Â¦ we extend our*
Â¦ profoundest sympathy, and. consolation to his',
stricken wife. Her grief is ours. A nation's
tears' mingle with hers. In spirit we stand
' 'by "her side at -the. bier- of the illustrious . -.
dead to comfort and- protect her in this the
.supreme hour of trial and sorrow, and as we
reverently eaze upon his noble face, once - j
full of life and purpose, but .now cold and '
calm in death, we solemnly ' repeat his dy
ing words, "Thy will be done."
Further resolved that as ' a token of â¢ our?

Out of respect to President McKinley
the convention adjourned to September 26
at 8 p. m.
Resolutions ""of sympathy to ! be later
telegraphed to Mrs. McKinley. were adopt
ed on motion- of Leon B. Samuels.
The names selected by the delegates
were as follows in the order of Assembly
districts: ...
J W. Larsen, Thomas Bird, S.- Schloss,
Thomas P. Saunders. J. B. Lewis Jr., J. C.
Â¦Welch. Clifford McClellan. Merton C. Allen.
Frank French. Thomas V. Maxwell. I. Gold
man. Marc Antony. Edmund Tauszky. C. A.
Murdock. Charles Sonntag. R. H. Warfleld,
Charles Sheble; George \V. Kingsbury.
District -suggested: the appointment of a
committee of one from each of the As
sembly districts on platform and resolu
tions and ' order \of business. This pro
voked another debate, the question being
whether the chairman of each delegation
or the chairman of the contention should
appoint. For a few moments It was ap
parent that- the convention was a free
and-easy one, and a rollcall was ordered.
Before the result could be announced a
number of the delegations changed their
votes, the final result being in favor of
the amendmentâ the "appointment of the
committee by. the delegates and not by
the chair. ' The' result as announced was
178 for. the amendment, and 169 against.
Martin Kelly took a prominent part In
the debate for. the nomination of the com
mittee by the chair. Â» "
Members of the Committee.
Walter- S. Brann of the Forty-second
District named Thomas D. Riordan as
temporary, chairman and he was unani
mously elected. There was considerable
discussion as to the policy of electing a
chairman,- %any delegates expressing a
desire to adjourn without this formality.
A heated .debate followed, but Riordan
was finally chosen. On assuming the
chair, Rioi dan t-aid that he regretted that
a motion to adjourn had been presented
at such. an early time, as the law. was
plain *and enforced -updn the convention
certain'' perfunctory duties. . He paid a
high tribute to the deceased President. Â¦
"it Is only meet and proper," he said,
"that -we should put a plank In our plat
form, demanding that Congress should
control, immigration; not to shut out the
honest farmer or artisan, but the nihil
ists; the anarchists and the socialists. In
this hour, of our crisis let us ail forget
factional 'differences and unite_ as only
Republicans' can be united." ; . ".
On- motjon of W. W. Shannon of the
Forty-third Dltrict A. K. Daggett of the
Forty-fourth District was elected tempor
ary secretary.
! Frank French of the Thirty-sixth Dis
trict suggested the appointment of a com
mittecof one from each Assembly district
to. pass upon the qualifications of dele
gates, i This provoked another long dis
cussion,- the members not understanding
apparently that under the law the Regis
trar's certificate was sufficient. '
Onmotion of W. H. R. McMartin of the
Forty-second Assembly District the tem
porary I officers of the convention were
elected as the permanent officers.
. H. G: :\V. Dinkelsplel of the Forty-first
. After adjournment delegates represent
ing ; the Thirty-third and Fortieth, who
were counted on to uphold the pro
gramme, denied that they misunderstood
the question and insisted that they voted
clearly and intelligently against the
proposition ' to allow the chairman to
name the. committee. . Politicians discuss
ing the break expressed the opinion that
the manipulators could not hold the con
vention to a programme of nominations.
Predictions were^freely^made that n-juiy
a slate would be smashed before the
wind up.*, T " "Â¦-' '"Â¦"-"-'Â¦'- ' -
Augustus Tilden called the convention
to order. The roll call disclosed the pres
ence of 251 delegates. Â¦ Norman XV. Hall
presented. a series of resolutions in eulogy
of President McKinley. but these Â» were
temporarily ruled out of_ order as the or
ganization of llie convention had not been
effected...' . ;
By a vote of ITS to 169 1-3 the conven
tion upset the Herrin programme and
declared that each delegation should have
a member of the platform committee.
The unique spectacle of the Forty-first
nnd Twenty-eighth districts voting to
gether on a declaration of independence
was presented.
Upsets the Programme.
â¢ A programme motion that the chairman
should: appoint a committee of eighteen
on platfonn and ' j esoiutlons, one from
each Assembly district, caused the sen
sation of the evening. Prank French of
Â¦ the.Thirty-sixlh and General R. H.; War
field of the Forty-third led the pro
grammers; A motion was quickly maOe
thai each district delegation select its
member to the platform committee. The
first expression on the question was viva
voce and It seemed clear to delegates and
spectators' that the convention by living
voice had in favor of choice by
district delegation, but the chair ruled to
the contrary. Then the storm broke.
Then the programme was broken, in
stantly a hundred delegates clamored for
a roll call. Delegates, fearing that the
chairman would ignore the demand and
declare the amendment lost, intensltied
the clamor for roll calls. Twe sergeants-at
arms were dispatched to the Twentv
eighth district 10 keep an eye on Boss
Kelly. Chairman Ulordan announced that
the roll call would be called, but the din
was so great that delegations could not
hear his voice. > . :
Order/ was restored when Chairman
Kiordan took the gavel, but a tumult oc
curred when a programmer moved for the
appointment of a committee to pass upon
the qualification of delegates. Martin
Kelly rushed to the front and declared
that. the list supplied by the Registrar bf
Voters should . govern. The convention
sustained -him. V: "Â¦,Â¦Â¦;.Â¦
M?.rtin Kelly Gains a Point.
â¢-Â¦ Atter-a "succession of spirited scenes and
sqmc . aroitrary rulings on the part of
Augustus Tiiaen, cha.rman of the County
Coniinittee^a temporary organization was
effected -by the election of Thomas D.
Riordan chairman. Tilden refused to en
tertain a resolution to adjourn in respect
to the memory of President McKinley,
holding that not even a motion to adjourn
could be entertained before, organization
was effected. This ruling, evoked stormy
protests..- . - v â¢â¢Â»*Â¦'; . '
., -The ..Republican municipal convention
met : and - organized last evening. Dele
gates displayed their independence by re
fusing to accept the programme in its en
tirety. The break astounded the friends
of Herrin and they sought to explain it on
the ground that tne Thirty-third and For
tieth district delegations voted under a
misapprehension, .it was. noted as a sig
nificant tact that Martin Kehy was one
of â¢ the leaders in the movement to upset
the progcarrnrne. The boss did not ascend
to , high flights of oratory, but in ample
exercise ot lung. power he commanded the
notice of the cmtirman and obtained rec
ognition. : Doubtless he is holding his
gr>Â»at oratorical effort in reserve.

PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESI
DENTâSubscriber, City. According .to
the accepted theory and practice In all
cases in which the Vice President of the
United States has succeeded to the office
of President through the death of the
President he has succeeded to tha title as
well as the office and all executive docu
ments have been signed as President. In
tho meantime the duties he performed as
Vice President devolve upon the Presi
dent pro tempore of the Senate, who la
law is known only by this latter title.
The reason for this is In the following:
1. The Vice President Is directly a crea
ture of the constitution, whereas tha
President pro tempore is a creature of a
Congressional statute. 2. Ther Vice Presi
dent is elected by the suffrages of the cit
izens of all the States as a representative
of the entire country, whereas the Presi
dent pro tempore of the Senate first by
choice of the Legislature of only a single
State as Senator for that State, and sec
ond by choice of the Senate as Its pre
siding officer. While he he re
tains his rights as a Senator, and whereas
the Vice President cannot vote except
when there is a tie, the President pro
tempore can vote a 3 freely as If he wera
not the presiding officer. In cases where
a two-thirds vote is requisite, as In tha
overriding of a Presidential veto, this Is
a material matter. 3. The Vice President
succeeds to the office of President for the
entire period of the unexpired term of the
.President removed or deceased, whether
that be but a few days or, as In the case
of Fillmore and Johnson, nearly the whole
of Hhe four years. On the other hand, the
President pro tempore of the Senate can
In no case succeed to the office of Presi
dent, for by the act of 1886, In case of no
President and no Vice Presldlht to take
the office of President, the office of Presi
dent goes in the following line of succes
sion: To the Secretary of State, of the
Treasury, of War, of the Navy, Postmas
ter General. Secretary of the Interior and
Attorney General. The compensation of
the Vice President Is $5000 a year v The
Revised Statutes say: "Whenever there 13
no Vice President the President of the
Senate for the time, being is entitled to
the compensation provided by law for the
Vice President."
UPHARSINâ G>A. S.. Cummlngs, Cal.
Smith, in his Dictionary oC the Bible,
gives the following as the definition of
Upharsin: "It Is Chaldean. Mene, mene.
tekel upharsin â Numbered. numbered,
weighed and dividinss, according to Wil
liam Gesems In Hebrew Lexicon. The
mysterious inscription written upon the
wall of Belshazzer's palace in which Dan
iel read the doom of the king and his
dynasty. The Interpretation is given In
Daniel v, verses 26 to 28. In verse 28, peres
(a Chaldean singular participle: peres â
divided or broken) Is substituted for
upharsin (composed of the conjunction U
and plural participle parsin. which be
comes pharsln when the conjunction Is
prefixed." .
BALL GROUNDSâ Q. H. f City. The ball
grounds at the corner of Folsom and Six
teenth streets are on the northeast cor
ner, that Is as designated generally. Fol
som street from Eleventh street to the
bay is northeast by southwest, from Elev
enth to Fourteenth streets It makes a
curve and from Fourteenth street out
Folsom is almfst north and south. Six
teenth street , runs from southeast to
northwest just enough at each end to take
it off true east and west.

secretary of the soldiers' home. An ap
plicant who desires the sea breeze should

around the world against time, and as you

this department cannot answer your ques
tion in its prssent form.
TO-MORROWâ Constant Reader, City.
It Is not correct to say "'to-morrow is
Wednesday," because "is" Is indicative
of the present, while "to-morrow" refers
to the future. Therefore it Is correct to
say "To-morrow will be Wednesday."

Physicians throughout France claim
that this is one of the most Interesting
experiments which have been performed
in our time, since it, shows that the mae

surgical -instrument. Â¦ .
He knew that pieces, of metal had been
extracted from eyes In this way and he
thoughtit barely possible that he ml~ht
be able to extract the aalL Consequently
he provided; himself with a magnet and
having made the necessary Incision in the
skin, he placed it as near aa he could to
the nail. The result was exactly what he
had hoped for. The nail left its lurkinir
place in the child's throat and fixed it
self to the magnet. At once the child's
cough ceased and It is now in perfect
health.
An experiment, the first of Its kind was
successfully performed a few days ago by
Dr. Garel, a well-known 'Â¦ physician of
Lyons. France. Being called upon to pre
scribe : for an infant who was suffering
from an incessant couirh, be fancied the
trouble might be due to Â§ some . foreign
body which was clogging the respiratory
organs, and a . test whiten - he made with
Rontgen rays' satisfied him, that he was
right, for they showed distinctly that one
of the bronchial .tubes was obstructed.
He learned then from": the mother that
the infant had swallowed' a large â¢ nail
about two months before that time, but
that, as no grave symptoms had appeared
at the time little. importance had been at
tached to' the accident. Dr. Garel felt con
vinced that the nail was sticking in the
throat, but what puzzkd him was how he,
should extract It. Finally he determined
to try an electro-maeniit.

The people weep, but not in despair of their insti
tutions. They are all American, the growth of our
genius, and the President "who takes the great oath
over the slain body of his predecessor will not suffer
their least abatement or decline,
He has been a copious writer. .Not being a- man
of inherited fortune, he has acquired what he has by
legitimate business operations and by his pen. All
that he has written hss for; its theme the encourage
ment of truth, manhood and courage, and the incul
cation of faith in American institutions. He has
never hesitated in advocating the right when it was
unpopular. Indeed, he has never made the art of
popularity by suppressing, convictions a study. He
doesn't know how. Show him a great truth, repressed
by misconception and unpopularity, and no paladin
ever exceeded the hero spirit in which he will battle
for it.
He peculiarly illustrates executive ability. His leg
islative experience is confined to service in the New
York Assembly. As Civil Service Commissioner,
member of the Police Board of New York City'
where he and General Fred Grant served together',
and as Governor of New York and Assistant Secre
tary of the Navy, his duties were purely executive
and administrative, and his discharge of them was
without fault or flaw.
That was uttered many years ago, before the young
student had a man's beard, but it now comes forward
as testimony of the first importance to the vitality of
American liberty and its immortal element. v Since
then the career of the young man, who was regarded
as so typically what an American of the first order
ought to be, has been so thoroughly American that
his elevation to the first office has a reassuring effect
upon his countrymen and upon that intelligence
abroad which is in sympathy with our institutions.
The virile and rugged elem.ent in his character, that
has sometimes unfavorably impressed men, has in
fact always been subordinated to law, order and
proper public policy. Expressed by him with great
frankness in moments of confidence with the people,
in his official relations, this abounding sense of life
and force has become the energetic impulse of qf
ficial conduct always in the right direction and for the
general good.
In nominating Mr. Roosevelt for the Vice Presi
dency the National Convention wisely treated the
action as the selection of a possible President, and
sad and tragic events have vindicated its wisdom.
When Theodore Roosevelt graduated at college, a
professor, who had a high conception of his qualities
exhibited as a student, but who withal was some
what cynical about American institutions, said that
the capacity of the people for self-government and
the quality of permanence in our institutions would
be measured and judged by "the height to which they
would permit Theodore Roosevelt to rise.
Under the first plan, Adams, Jefferson and Burr
achieved the Vice Presidency. Under the second,
George Clinton, Elbridge Gem-, Daniel D. Tomp
kins, John C. Calhonn, Martin Van Buren, Richard
M. Johnson, John Tyler, George M. Dallas; Millard
Fillmore, William R. King, John C. Breckinridge,
Hannibal Hamlin, Andrew Johnson, Schuyler Col
fax, Henry Wilson, William A. Wheeler, Chester A.
Arthur, Thpmas A. Hendricks, Levi P. Morton,
Adlai E. Stevenson, Garrett A. Hobart and Theo
dore Roosevelt were elected. Of these twenty-one
Vice Presidents, six have become President â Van
Buren by election as Jackson's successor, and Tyler,
Fillmore, Johnson, Arthur and Roosevelt by the
death of the President.
But the original intent of the constitution has
been faithfully followed by the great parties, and the
nominee for Vice President has been selected with
a view to his fitness for the Presidency itself.
This plan was followed until the people divided
into political parties, when it became evident that
working under it might change the political character
of an administration, since the second choice of the
people would naturally be of a minority party differ
ing from the majority. The twelfth amendment,
adopted in 1804, therefore changed the plan to con
form to the existence of parties, and provided that
President and Vice President should be voted for on
the same ticket, practically, by arranging that the per
son receiving the highest number of electoral votes
for Vice President should fill that office.
THE constitution intended that the Vice Presi
dent should be a potential President. In carry
ing out this intent the first provision for the
great office was that the winner of the second highest
number of electoral votes "should be Vice President.
AN AMERICAN CAREER.
PERSONAL MENTION.
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
MISS HELEN MORTON, the most beautiful of former Vice President Mor
ton's daughters, who is engaged to marry Count Boson de Perigord.
second son of the Due de Talleyrand, is the best dressed athletic girl
in New York. She wears the smartest sporting clothes and is the best
all-around athlete among ,the young girls of the fashionable ,se.t. Society
men are united in their admiration of her vigorous stroke on the golf links and
the way in which she serves a tennis Â£aLI. She is a crack whip, too, and a daring
cross-country rider. ' . ' Â«
But when society women talk of Helen Morton it Is about her marvelous
sporting clothes, their beauty, style and originality, for she is s.n acknowledged
leader of fashion In all costumes for outdoor sports.
One has only to catch a glimpse of Miss Morton in the ballroom or on the golf
links to recognize In her splendid young beauty the typical athletic girl of the day.
She is remarkably tall, and, although slender in m appearance, is really broad
shouldered and muscular. The wild rose tint of her complexion is one charming
proof of her healthy outdoor life and another is her springy, graceful walk.
Again we rest in presenting the indictment found by the American press and people
against this mari and his newspapers. He threatens retaliation! Well, a rattlesnake may
do that. But William Rattlesnake Hearst must retaliate on the whole people and his
poison, great as it is, will not hold out.
The New York Press prints the following^letter: "Sir: Last Saturday afternoon while
discussing the assassination of the -President" a large number of citizens of the United
States formed a league known as the Anti-Anarchh.t League. We are associated to in
fluence our friends and their friends against the Yellow Journalâ an instrument in -.the
hands, of W. R. Hearst. CHARLES B. CAROLAN; President.";
' The New York Sun of the 13th inst. prints two solid columns, of letters from citi
zens denouncing Hearst and his papers. '
Springfield (NlaSS.) Union: "That these utterances have incited to such. Â« crime is
even admitted by that anarchist of anarchists, John N Most, who bluntly blames the New
York Journal for the dastardly crime of, Friday." . Â»
Western Christian Advocate: "Seeds of calumny and defamation have i fallen on
fruitful soil. These sheets like the Journal of New" York have printed articles wherein
sympathy with assassination as a proper means of. venting malignity against order and the
laws of society was disguised. How long shall they be endured?"
. Dayton (Ohio) Journal: "At tfie door of Hearst may be laid this despicable deed.
He is quite right in his estimate of the mental capacity of the spawn of fiends. The honor
of feeding the food most 1 easily digested, by the brains of anarchism belongs to the pub
lication society headed by .Willie Hearst."
This and columns like it of encouragement to disorder and murder is being repro
duced in the. Eastern press. Commenting upon it the Brooklyn Times says: "Mr. Hearst
is responsible for what has been said in his own paper under his own name. For the pur
pose of increasing the sale of his paper among the discontented he has permitted utter
ances against the President that 'should long" ago have been silenced."
New Haven Register: "The conduct of the chief sinner in yellow journalism, with
his publications in New York, Chicago and San Francisco, has been responsible."
The New York Journal, Hearst's Eastern organ, said not long ago: "Do you doubt
that Mark Hanna, acting for McKinley, will increase the army and if occasion arise use
it against organized labor, which he so much hates? 'Of course, looked at from high up,
society seems almost as important as the scum that rises to the top of a kettle of honest
soup. Good soup is all beneath the society scumâ and very often that scum has to be
skimmed off, as in the French revolution. And our little society is so harmless it will
be easily skimmed off when the time comes."
Chicago Journal:* "Is there any remedy for this yellow peril? Must; it > continue as
long as men incited by a spirit of mischief choose to publish newspapers that pander to
the lower instincts of humanity? This has been Mr. Hearst's idea of a newspaper, aid
he has made his papers vehicles for the dissemination of all kinds of reeking tales that
smell of the muck heap. Just as long as people patronize such papers they will be pub
lished. The, remedy for the yellow peril lies with the community."
New York Post: "Free discussion does not mean freeclorri to incite violence. ."" We
allow religious liberty, but no* man can plead his religion as an excuse for. committing
bigamy or murder. In the same way the advocate of violence in any form/whatever his
political tenets, is amenable to punishment. If he urges defiance of law in a. strike he
shares the moral and legal responsibility for the deaths which will follow. If he "suggest
the shooting of Presidents, even though he himself may stay cajmly weaving silk in
Paterson, his hand is red.'V *
"Slander is not of the essence of the Declaration of Independence, nor is libel
licensed in the constitution. Why should any newspaper enjoy" immunity for obscene
and cruel attacks upon the. man whom millions have chosen as their chief, for. a fixed
term, when, were the same man in private life, a tithe of the abuse would subject the pub
lisher of the paper to imprisonment and his pocket to heavy drafts?
"Have we done away with pillory and stocks ol wood to replace them v/ith
those of ink and paper?
"There .are certain newspapers in this country that Mr. McKinley's assailant
read. Who can measure the force or extent of the influence published 'ribaldry had
upon his vulpine mind?" ".".* â¢-â¢Â¦
Times* Minneapolis: "Among the rights of Americans is that of a free press.
It should be, and is likely to remain, an inalienable-right as a general possession. When,
however, a newspaper persistently, consistently and maliciously misrepresents, holds up
to scorn, viciously and untruthfully attacks, the person and character ; of the nation's
chief magistrate â when these printed attacks are supplemented by pictures calculated to
cast contempt upon the highest office on earth, then freedom has v given place to license
and the offending newspaper should be punished in such measure and manner as would
insure a change of course and a due regard for decency. .
New Era> Benicia: "Hearst was bright enough to see profit to be gained by catering
to depraved demand. He has made money by doi-jg so, but he has produced a monster
in journalism which before it dies of its own rot is, likely to do untold harm." - '
New York Press: "Under the Chicago anarchist decision the District . Attorney of
Erie County could probably indict if not convict William R. Hearst for conspiring, to as
sault William McKinley. It was thought a joke, to watch the antics of the demented yel
low editor who raved that the President of the United States was delivering to 'the
financial oligarchy' the machinery of this Government. ; It was a joke to hear his shrieks
that 'the trusts control the present commander in chief of the army and navy "of the United
States.' It was a joke to hear him chatter that when the starving populace was crying at
the door of the White House for bread 'a fat white hand will toss its answer/but of the'win
dow â a trust can do no wrong!'. It was a joke to hear him rant that the aim of the
President of the United States was to make of the poor men 'slaves in a. pen.' It ,was
a joke to hear him scream that assassinations â the murder of Lincolnâ^'hastened the
A'merican era of good feeling and possibly prevented the renewal of, fighting among
brothers!' The' American people did hot approve such sentiments and outcries. -So rhey
took it as a joke to listen to the shrieks of the insane man and laughed' at them and
him. They are not laughing now, nor seeking any more of those yellow jokes. .They
are numb and sick and white with horror and shame. The American spirit has^bnly to
shut the door of every American home in the face of such journalism, in theschoor and
pulpit to call it not a joke, but what it is, the gospel of assassination, ancLthen it will be
dead, its excesses and crimes ended and the American people will march oh to the aims
and ideals of the American spirit."
Reedley Exponent: "The people are now wondering;if jttie Examiner was honest with
its readers when it was cartooning the President and pandering to the worst element. ot
society, or is it now, while lamenting over the heinousness of the crime of the cowardly
assassin." , â¢ - ':Â¦'â¢Â¦â¢ Â¦
The Marysville Appeal says: "The Examiner is largely responsible for the prolonga
tion of the strike by reason of the unscrupulous support it has given the strikers, par
ticularly because of its conscienceless appeals to. their prejudices and passions against their
employers. Deeds speak louder than words, and , surely the advertisers of San Francisco
must see that the Examiner instead of being their ally is in reality their malicious enemy."
'Alameda ArgUSI "The Examiner set the strike going all right, and kept it up for a
time, but now it can't stop it with any "safety for itself or its dupes. -That is different."
Â¥ T, PON the concurrent .lines of its so-called _ policy the Hearst newspaper school
I continues to receive the Jash of the press all over the country. Ah occasional
I spasmodic attempt is made to attribute this to business rivalry. The country
â^ press all over the land feels no rivalry with the three Hearst papers! It pro
ceeds as if they were not in existence,- and treats them only as it does any other conspic
uous evil, dangerous to the general welfare. â.';- ; ' :

was all that could be desired. . The play
affords Mr. Haworth the opportunity that
he makes the most of, and that enables
him to give the San Francisco public a
taste of his real quality. The piece is
splendidly scened and costumed, and the
setting of the gardens of the Louvre .in
the fourth 'act are especially applauded
and admired. The star is to be congratu-"
lated upon the support given him by Her
schell Mayall, whose De Mauprat is virile
and soldierly, as the author intended that
it should be. Mr. Mayall divided the hon
ors with Mr. Haworth and Miss Stone and
well earned them. Harry . Plimmer's De
Baradas may be criticized on the score
of being, a little too dramatic, but that
fault is preferable to the opposite ex
treme, and when we can't get what we.
want on the stage we are thankful for
the next best. Richelieu is a success,
abounding in clean, honest work, and de
serves the best reception that the theater
going public can bestow. 1
Grand Opera-House.
of Montanari Slgnorina Barbareschi sang
the role of Marguerite, considerably to the
betterment of the balance of the opera.
The part is much more grateful to Bar
bareschi than to Montanari, and the
former Is Indeed doing excellent service
this season. The cast as now arranged
is the best-balanced and most effective of
the seasonâ Dado in his splendid Mephis
to, Agostinl's fine Faust and Salassa a
magnificent Valentine. The Siebfcl of Pol
lettinl has also improved amazingly this
week, and her hearty encore for . the
"Flower Song" was well won. Barba
reschi sings to-morrow evening also, and
the opera is decidedly worth hearing. To
night "Carmen" is again the bill, with the
same cast as last week. Those holding
tickets for last Saturday's matinee and
for Thursday evening next are requested
to exchange them as early as possible.
"Nabucco," a rarely heard Verdi opera,
with Salassa In the fine name part, Is one
of next week's attractions.
The Orpheum, as usual, was crowded to
its utmost capacity last night, and every
number on the new programme was
heartily applauded. Dorothy Morton sang
splendidly and was rewarded with three
encores. "The Bridegroom's Reverie,"
presented by "the Misses Delmore and
Walter Caryll, is a pretty piece, full of
romantic novelty.
Ernest Hogan became hoarse, so often
did he have to reappear on the stage, and
Orpheum.
The rest are cardboard figures merely,
with about the same relation to life as
tha ancient and respectable tintype, and
the acting is on a par with the author's
conceptions. The plot is sufficiently In
genious, - and . handled differently would
have made a success, but the treatment
is haphazard in the extreme and the hit
of the evening was the coon song lugged
In by the ears when Mr. Seabrooke < wisely
decided there was nothing better to do.
After the hopeless muddle of the first
act the second flops unexpectedly into a
mildly humorous scene and the audience
hoped for better things. But the third
act, where the heroine,' attired in dodo
birds and a Parisian cut of a Samoan
bark toilet, with a similar inspiration to
Mr. Seabrooke's, is persuaded Into a
timid cakewalk, effectively disposed of
any expectations of that kind and the
impatient ones who did not leave after
the second act found their way out then.
One caught a glimpse of what Mr. Sea
brooke can do when he is not trying to
play multi-millionaires, and one. wished
him, for his own sake, safe in the bosom
of the Orpheum, where he belongs. He
has the pleasantest voice in a song, and
if he would but yield to his own inclina
tion and sing some more, it, would be bet
ter for the play. Lynn Pratt, In his sup
port, shows possibilities. Leighton Leigh,
Helen Gladstone and Isabella Evesson are
also much better than their parts.
GUISARD.
"Not quite bad enough to bo funny,"
I heard my neighbor at the Columbia
say last night, after three acts .of Mr.
Sydney Rosenfeld's new comedy, "A Mod
em Crusoe." And that is as fit and pat
phrasing of the truth as may be. "A Mod
ern Crusoe," If worse, would be funnier.
It Is a queer v mlx-up of socialism, sentt
mentallsm and : pathos, with occasional
glints of genuine humor in the plot, and
a lavish absence of anything approach
ing character drawing. Mr. Seabrobke
has the only part of any weight In the
playâ a multi-millionaire helplessly de
pendent on the push-the-button- habit,
who Is cast on a desert Islandâ and he is
evidently not at his best in it.

CHICAGO', Sept. 16.â December Wheat opened
%<BV*c higher at 70%@70^c, the strength | of
stocks being Influential in preserving confi
dence in the financial stability of the country
After touching 70%c. December dropped to 70",!
@70%c.on profit taking fey scalpers.
There were a number of resting orders to buy
which came out on the reaction. Offerings be
came light and a fair total demand sprang up,
somewhat influenced by the- strength of corn
and the market advanced to 71Hc The heavy
receipts' and rather bearish statistics caused
liquidation on the advance, but the market re
acted only to 70H^70%c and the close was firm,
December Â«6@%c higher it 70%@70%c.
Confidence that the monetary situation has
been undisturbed by the calamity at Buffalo
together with a fear or frost, was the control
ling influence which resulted In an advance In
Corn prices. Trade was local but fairly active,
and although there was considerable profit
taking on the advance the dose found the
market in a strong position. December closed
%c up at 57%(fti)7%c.
Oats were quiet but firm, the corn strength,
light receipts and a decrease In local stocks
giving the market an independent strength.
Local shcrts did most of the buying. December
closed %@>y&c higher at 36c.
Provisions, the most sensitive market on the
board to the action of stocks, were considerably
strengthened by the Wall street market.- A fair
cash demand further; aided a good tone. ThÂ»
market, however, was not active and part of
the early advance was lost on profit taking.
January Pork closed 6c higher at $15 80. Lard

Although receipts of Potatoes were very
heavy, amounting to 96S5 sacks, the ' market
was firmer, with better prices realized on the
wharf. ' Onions, on the contrary, were rather
weak than otherwise. Sweet Potatoes were
slightly lower, with the arrival of two cars.
All kinds of Vegetables were in liberal sup
ply^ and as there was a good deal of Satur
day s stock on the market low prices ruled.

Condition of the Treasury
WASHINGTON. Sept. 16.â To-day's statement
of the Treasury balances in the general fund,

cash balance, $186,139,195; gold, $118,788,017.
Salmonâ The reports of the heavy pack on
the Fraser River ar.d at Puget Sound tend to
keep spot prices Irregular, and the fall^rom top
quotations of a month or so back is a heavy
one, rarticulariy ' n the case of Fraser River
ealmon. The present prices are causing -a
largely increased consumption. Reliable figures
as to * : he pack on Fraser River and at Puget
ScuTin are not yet obtainable, but, while.it Is
not disputed that the i>ack at these two centers
is an exceptionally heavy one. it is pointed jut
that the supplier forwarded to the British n.ar
kcts will not necessarily be proportionately
large. The consuming pov:ers of the Immense
population in the States can absorb huge sup
plies of tinned ' goods, and. if prices here go
exceptionally low. doubtless some portion of
the usual consignments may be diverted. Liver
poolâIt is possible that it may be found that
the decline in prices has already been dis
counted as much ss is necessary, and there Is
a steady consumptive demand at current rates.
There If no doubt the reduction in the price
lias brought a large number of consumers on
to the coods and considering the very high
l-ates for provisions of all k*nds H Is rot to b-^
rendered at that salmon should be so much
called for.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 1Câ A rampant bull stock
market on the first day of trading following the
death of the President of the United States Is
an anomaly. Baldly stated, that is ' what oc
curred to-day. Xo one, not even the most Ean
guine, was prepared for the action of the day's
ptock market. Much was heard on Saturday
and has been published since of the length to
which the lamentable outcome of the Presi
dent' 6 hurt had already been discounted in the
operations of last week and especially those of
Friday. In part these assertions were made
â¢with a view of Influencing speculative : senti
ment and keeping up the courage of those. who
feared a collapse in the market. | Those' '.who
made the assertion sincerely probably, had no
id<Â°& of the- extent to which the recuperative
forces of the' market j would be affected, but
supposed merely that demoralization would be
checked and the market be able to. resist vio
lent losses. Confidence rvas felt. In fact, that
the purely speculative -pressure on the market
would be successfully overcome, owing to the
extent to which speculative selPng had already
gone and to the ample preparations and con
certed measures adopted by the Clearing-houte
banks and great .capitalists to arotect the
money market and resist declines In the stock
market. The portion of the problem remaining
to be 6oJved was the effect which would be pro
duced upon business sentiment in general
throughout the country and among the substan
tial investment holders of securities. A move
ment to liquidate on the part of this element,
actuated by the conviction that a prolonged
period of .doubt and apprehension was to be
faced, would inevitably overcome the market,
in spite of the most strenuous efforts of manipu
lation. The day's events seemed to demonstrate
a 6trong underlying confidence In the future of
business a^idthe continuance of the country's
prosperity. Powerful manipulation avowedly
had its part In the day's rise, especially in the
opening, u-hich was designed to Intimidate the
speculative bear element. It not only had that
effect, brt caused a scramble to cover on the
part of the uncovered shorts who looked for a
decline. There also was an abatement of orders
to buy at prices below the market on the part
of investors and bargain hunters, which served
as a protection against bear aggression. There
was a considerable element, as well, which
looked for an opening break in. prices and
hoped to secure bargains by placing orders to
buy at the market. As the event proved the
opening market was from 3 to 6 points higher
than on Friday afternoon. There was a lack
of confidence -in the early strength -of the mar
ket, and there were many-realizing movements
during the day. but the absorptive power of the
market proved equal to all of these and with a
steady uplift the trading closed active and firm
at about the top level of the day. ' . The solemn
RÂ«puranees given -by the new President of his
purpose to maintain the continuity of the Gov
ernmental policies -was Â¦ a relief - to capitalists'
conservative dread of change. The tank state
ment of Saturday encouraged the hope that the
Treasury's relief â¢ of the money â¢ market would
prove effective against , money ,_ stringencies.
Large dividend payments to-day, including a
distribution of $S,000,000 to Standard Oil . stock
holders, made themselves f elf in the money

The most sensational episode in the trou
ble between " Treasurer. Nourse of the As

tee on student affairs occurred in a meet
ing of the Associated this aiter
noon. The metting was called for' the pur

executive committee â¢â¢ of the Associated
Students power to remove any official of
the organization, thus covering the aase
of Treasurer Nourse. This resolution was
laid on -the table and -one expressing con
fidence in. Nourse was passed almost
unanimously. .
This action came as a complete, surprise
to a majority of the assembled students
For a. moment after., the measure waa
voted upon there was dead silence, and
then the applause that followed showed
how great was the friendly feeling toward
Nourse on the part of at least a ; lar&re

was the appointment of a commission,
consisting of J. N. Beard, E. R. Dille, M.
D. Buck, W. S. Urmy and *\ D. Bovaia,
to make the apportionment of all church
benevolence. A lengthy and heated dis
cussion preceded the vote on this ques
tion, as it touches a vital point of church
work and the present method of appor
tionment has been found inadequate. â¢ Â¦
Bishop McCabe announced the transfer
to this conference of F. Sheldon from Dea

The work of the conference was re
sumed at 9 o'clock, reports of standing
committees being the first business of the
morning. The report of the Sabbath ob
servance committee was notable for a
statement that anarchy was the logical
result of a desecrated Sabbath, on the
ground that violation of divine laws en
genders violation of human laws.

NEW YORK, Sept. 16.â At a session of
the Chamber of Commerce to-night, after
paying a tribute to the dead President.
Abraham S. Hewitt, ex-Mayor of Now
York, said: \ v "
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 16.-The Los
Angeles Jobbers' Association has scored
what is in all probability the greatest vic
tory ever achieved for the commerce of
this city. After contending for months
H-or a readjustment of freight rates to
, r points In the San Joaquin Valley, which
would give this city an equal footing with
ban irancisco, a compromise has been
reached which in some lines will give Los
Angeles absolute command of trade in a
large section which it hag heretofore been
able to reach only against a serious han
dicap. While heretofore there has been a
email differential in favor of San Fran
cisco for trade at Bakersfield and greater
differentials in favor of the metropolis at
all points north of Bakersfield, Los An
geles now has a good differential in its
favor for the Bakersfield trade and is in a
position to share the trade of towns as far
north as Visalia, with small differentials
against it at that extreme distance.
How tliÂ© Victory Was Gained.
The Issue was first raised In a petition
to the Southern Pacific Company for a re
duction of rates from this city. This
appeal was turned down abruptly by the
railroad officials, who gave tnls citv to
understand that any change In the rela
tionship of rates from San Francisco and
Lob Angeles was out of the question.
An effort was then made to bring the
issue before the courts, but the Attorney
General decided against the suit being
brought and it was annulled.
Some days ago, however, the question
was brought up again and a consultation
was held. In which the Jobbers' Associ
ation was represented by President M II.
Xewmark, F. W. Braun, C. C. Reynolds,
L. C. Scheller and Will S. Bishop. The
Stuthern Pacific Company was represent
ed by Messrs. Stubbs and Sproul of the
general traffic department, and by G. \\\
Luce, assistant general passenger agent
in Los Angeles.
The question was under discussion for
,-<<ome days, ending in a compromise very
t-atisfactory to the jobbers of Los Angeles,
though the official figures have not been ,
made public. It is understood that the i
new rates will be made effective within
ten days. â¢ - j
For nrst-class commodities the reduc- j
tions in freight rates range about 12 per <
cent, while from that the , percentage of!
reduction in rates ranges down to about
3 per cent for fifth class (carload) ship
men tE.
Extent of San Francisco's Loss.
The point of equilibrium between San
Francisco and Los Angeles rates is moved I
about fifty : tniles nor'h of Bakersfield. !
But, as or.e town can invade the territory
in which another has the advantage of a
*mall differential. Los Angeles will be '
Able, in many lines, to compete- with al
most equality as far north as Visalia and.
Porterville.

A committee from the coupling tap in
the tube works at McKeesport demanded
that Superintendent Mowatt reinstate
twenty men who were discharged this
morning." He refused, and the couplers
voted to stay out in a body. That de
partment was running with a full force
to-night.
The results of the strike In McKees
port are: â¢ Wood mill probably lost to
McKeesport; Demmler lost to McKees
port; Demmler lost to the union. More
than $1,000,000 was lost in wagea as fol
lows: 9500 National Tube men out five
weeks $750,000; S00 Wood men out eleven
weeks, $165,000; TOO Demmler men out niuÂ«
weeks, $30,000; total. $1,003,000.
The indications that the tin workers
will withdraw from the Amalgamated
Association shortly and form an independ
ent organization are becoming stronger.
Many of the more prominent workmen
are active in suggesting this course, and
of giving united aid to those men who
are standing out in the Star and Monon
gahela .plants.
The reports from the National Tube
Company mills showed that over 4000
strikers in McKeesport asked for work
there in the various plants during the
day. Of this number about 2000 were em
ployed. The other 2000 were not em
ployed owing to the mills not being ready
for them.
It is expected that they will all return
to work during the week. ,
At 6 o'clock to-night President Shaffer
left the office for his home. He looked
neither to the right nor to the left. Ha
seemed much depressed and wanted tt>
avoid every one. Other officials of the or
ganization busied themselves circulating
among the angry about the offices
and making a plea for quietness and pa
tience. They insisted that the settlement
would not prove to be so bad as had been
reported., None of those who did this
work was ready, however, to give any
inkling of the terms granted the Amalga
mated Association or how it affected thÂ»
men on strike.
A meeting 1 of the tin-workers of the
Star mills was held during the afternoon
and the matter of the strike settlement
was taken up. After the meeting the men.
announced that they had decided to re
main out and keep up the strike until they
had heard from President Shaffer. Tney
added that In case the terms were sucn
as to make the Star mill non-union they
would positively refuse to return to worlc
and would fight the battle single-handed.
The American Sheet Steel Company re
ported that the strikers had returned to
the Idle mills in New Philadelphia. Ohio;
PIcqua. Ohio, and the Etna Standard
mills in Mingo Junction, and that some
had asked for work in the Canal Dover

PITTSBURG, Sept. 16.â It was a turbu
lent day for President Shaffer and the
general officials of the Amalgamated As
sociation. The headquarters of the or
ganization were crowded to-day from
morning to evening with delegates of
strikers awaiting word from the leader
regarding th6 settlement of the strike.
The callers at the general offices were all
more or less excited, and many were deep
ly incensed. Many of the strikers declared
they would not respect the order calling:
the strike off before they were given full
particulars of the settlement, others were
calling boldly for the resignation of Presi
dent Shaffer and another class demanded
the -withdrawal of their lodges from. tb-Â»
organization.

A peculiar feature of this house is that
it is practically a network of electric
wires. In every joist and molding there
are electric wires running up and down
the walls. Brickwedel says that they were
there when he took the house and cannot
see of what use they are. His wife claims
that they must have been used by Isaak
and his anarchist friends in a private tele
phone system. She said last night that
often during the week when she is in the
back part of the house or in the yard she
hears a . mysterious electric bell ring.
When questioned more closely she said
that it sounded like a telephone bell and
that it certainly did not sound like, a bell
ringing in the house, but that it sounded
as if it had been placed between her house
and the next.
Mrs. :Heal says that, when Isaak left
her house she was glad to see him go.
She says that she mistrusted him and told ;
him that she did not care to rent him her
rooms any longer. She says that he moved
from her house to lodgings at Valencia
and. Eighteenth streets. -.There- was a
lodging 'house there up to a few months
ago, when the furniture was sold, -and one
family now occupies the whole premises.
House Mysteriously Wired.
Brickwedel, when he first became an oc
cupant of the house, found the place In a
very dirty condition. He said- yesterday
that' the place was strewn with papers
and he regrets now that he threw tnem
away, as he thinks that they would have
been of great value to the police.'
In a corner of the hall stands a : large
safe. Brickwedel had -ittempted to open
this safe on a number of occasions. After
the assassination of President McKinley
a rumor was circulated that this safe con
tained valuable papers and had been used
at one time by Isaak. Another rumor was
to the effect that the safe was filled with
dynamite. Brickwedel was seen yesterday
in regard to these rumors and he said
that Be had heard such rpports and was
not in a 'position to deny them, 'as he had'
never attempted to' open the safe.. He
said his wife was anxious to have the safe
moved out of the house, as she was nerv
ous and afraid that it might be filled with
explosives. â¢ - -.
â¢ Last evening The Call engaged an ex
pert and took him to the house to open
the safe. Ifrook this skilled manipulator
of safes from 7 o'clock till 11 in the even

safe was empty, but the residents of the
neighborhood will now rest easier that the
mystery is solved. v .
The former residence of Abraham Isaak
and the meeting place of the anarchists
of this city several months ago is situat

presslon to the deep sense of loss they
feel through the death of William Me-
Klnley. The meeting- was held In respect
to< the memory of the late Chief Execu
tive, and although called by the Berkeley
Republican Club it was a citizens' meet
ing in every particular. '
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of* the
University of California delivered the
principal address,' dwelling upon the
theme of the late President's great and
natural interest In mankind. The gath
ering was held in Odd Fellows' Hall and
was presided over by Thomas Rickard,
president of the Republican Club. . Mr.
Kickard, in calling the meeting to order,
said: â¢
i As president of the Berkeley Republican
Club, I have asked you to Â¦ come together
to-night, not ' as Republicans, but as citi
zens, to ; give . expression of what we feel
concerning: the loss the nation has sustained.
President Wheeler then' addressed the
meeting, saying. in part:
. 1 am glad to be here as a citizen of
Berkeley and join with you in an* ex-:
. presslon concerning our . beloved President. â¢
I trust that the whole body of citizens will
assemble Thursday morning next in Har- 'Â¦
mon Gymnasium, where the university, the j
churches and the people will join together
for an expression of ' last thought' and
action. President McKinley was thor
oughly human. He was a man among men,
" spontaneously interested in all Â¦ mankind. "
Any one who has seen the light in his eyes ;
when he looked into another's must have
known his peculiarly kindly nature. His
>. wonderful influence over man was due. to
the interest he took in their affairs. Prob-"
ably no President has ever been so near the,
people. His sympathy | with other men
enable him to mold a wonderful influ
ence in Congress. * ' Â¦ . Â¦ * ' .
He has given us the best 'â¢ realization " of .
.any President of the smooth action, of this
.; Government when all parts run together.
! Never has there been a time perhaps when :
the different forces that go to make the
Government worked together so well as In
McKinley's administration, especially . dur
ing: the trying times Just preceding the
" Spanish War.
When Mr. McKinley made his recent tour
through the country I think he found out
.what we have all recognized, that his ad
ministration was popular with the people.
. As we think of the party divisions of a few
months'agro this stands as a warning to us
not to be led by partisan ardors to do
things we do not mean to do. Many men-.
. cast . their â¢ ballots because of party tra
. dltions and not according to their best
judgment.- ~ ' "Â¦? :Â¦:Â¦: *
His administration was more popular than
the election 'returns show. Mr. McKinley
Â¦ showed a perpetual sympathy to his Invalid:

H. B. Griffiths was called upon and

The effect of eating Grape-Nuts ten
days or two weeks and the discontinuance
of ordinary while bread is very marked.
TkÂ» user will gain rapidly in strength and
PCjelcal and n:en?s*Â»health.
In this way the starchy part is trans-
formed into grape-sugar in a perfectly
natural manner, without the use of chem-
icals or any outside Ingredients. The lit-
tle sparkling crystals of grape-sugar can
be seen on the pieces of Grape-Nuts. This
food therefore is naturally pre-digested,
and its use in place of bread will quickly
correct the troubles that have been
brought about by the too free use of
starch In. the food, and that is very com-
mon in the human race to-day.
Email wonder that appendicitis, perito-
nitis, constipation and all sorts of trouble
exist when we go so contrary to nature's
jaw. The food experts that perfected
Grapft-Kuts Food, knowing these facts,
made use in their experiments of the en-
tire wheat and barley, .including all the
parts, and subjected them to moisture
and long continued warmth, which allows
time and the proper conditions for devel-
oping the diastase outside of, the human
body. "
This diastase Is absolutely necessary, to
digest starch and turn It Into grape sugar,
â¢which is the next form: but that part of
the wheat berry makes dark flour, and the
r^dern miller cannot readily sell dark
'Mur, fo nature's valuable digester la
tnrown out and the human system must
handle the starch as best it can, without
the help that nature intended.
Up under the shell of the wheat berry
nature has provided a curious deposit,
which is turned into diastase when It Is
subjected to the saliva and to the pan-
creatic juices in the human intestines.
Bread dyspepsia is common. It affects
the bowels, because white bread Is nearly
all starch, and starch Is digested In the
Intestines, not In the stomach proper.

Summary.
No better or more exciting sport could
be desired than that which marked tha
opening: of the Golden Gate race meeting
at Emeryville track yesterday. The asso
ciation caters to both the harness and
running horse elements, and, strange to
relate in this section of the country, the
2:14 trot was the salient feature of tha
entertainment. Seven subbornly contest
ed heats were necessary before the roan
horse Dan W, driven by J. Albertson, was
eventually returned winner.
The attendance was surprisingly large,
there being a bis gallery, and the rinj
was crowded with speculators dressed m
their best betting clothes. Three regrular
books and a combination book had all the
business they could attend to. Besides
the trot four running: events were de
cided, with the choices all bowled over.
"Chief" Russell and "PI" Ruiz each pilot
ed a brace of winners. . - - .
Unfortunately the programme was te
diously drawn out, through no fault qf
the management. Some of the horses
were late In arriving from Sacramento,
but this will be obviated to-day and the
racing will begin promptly at 1 o'clock.
Bookmaker Caesar Young lost the ser
vices of his consistent mare Good Hope in
the Golden Gate handicap, at six fur
longs. She was a hot favorite, with
Ransch up, and about three furlongs from
home, while leading, was cut down. An
examination showed the tendon complete
ly severed. Her racing days are over.
An upset closed the session. "Butch"
Fisher sent Helen Smith # to the barrier
for the first time, and at odds of 15 to 1
the Trentola filly landed the merchandise.
Russell let her slip to the front and she
lasted just long enough to beat Mike Rice
a half-length. Jim McCleevy, the favor
ite, ran third.

slx months' imprisonment in the- Alatneda,-
Jail for contempt -of court .committed./ by :
him when he adx*ised his clients to dis-r

raony, and. was released on 71003 bail. The

â¢Manager Renner of the Draymen:s As
sociation said there was nothing new: in
the situation. ' He- had heard" of no team
sters \ returning* to Â¦ work, nor did he ex
pect any to return until ample police pro
tection was assured every man who show
ed up. .He contended that many of the
teamsters were, more than anxious to re
turn, but that "the fear of \-lolence ; de
terred them from doing so. .'' r -"'..-.Â¦ V
. The draymen are perfectly at sea when
it 'comes to predicting when the strike
will end. 'The reports of defection in the
ranks of the strikers so often heard, and
usually- believed, are now listened to with
caution by the. employers. ..While the sen
timent is general that the strike is Â¦ wear
ing itself- out, recent developments have
proved the futility of accepting as true
the thousand and one rumors which are
floating about, and which invariably/prove
to *be without foundation. y v--.-.
/' The break, among the striking teamsters
which: was -expected to. occur yesterday
did not .materialize. This event was pre
dicted by some' of ! the draymen,, who
claimed to ; have inside information^ of Â¦ a
reliable character. The leaders â¢ of the
teamsters were .out with increased forcts
and promptly nipped the matter In the
bud, if,- indeed, the dissatisfied teamsters
were ready and - willing to desert the
cause of their union.'.-
No Break /Among Teamsters.
.John Parry of. 512 Mission street is = a
non-union boiler-maker. He was home in
bed and asleep when a number of strikers
called at his residence. They sent up
word that he was - wanted â¢ right- 'away
about some work. He arose, dressed and
went, to the door. He- was immediately
seized, dragged out to the sidewalk and
when, a half-hour later, he was removed'
to .the Harbor Hospital it was found 1 that
he had sustained a laceration of the right
ear, a laceration of.- the nose, numerous
contusions on the face, two ', lacerated
wounds of the left eyebrow and asimilar
wound of the right eyebrow. His nose is
probably broken. ,.Â¦â¢ Â¦' Â¦;...-'-.
John Sternberg, a deep s.ea sailor just in
from a long voyage, was attacked on
East and Folsom streets.'He was knocked
down and robbed of $6. The hospital rec
ord of nis case tells of . a lacerated scalp
and lacerated wounds of the left eyebrow
and the right cheek. Â£ ..,'.-. .,-Â¦.â¢..-..Â¦.
John Kaiser, a miner just arrived in the
city from Trinity County, was accosted on
Mission .and Ste'uart streets by three
strikers: They asked him for 10 cents, 1 ; He
took out; his purse, which was immedi
ately grabbed. - He recovered his money,
but at .the hospital Dr. McElroy put
stitches in a lacerated wound of the" left
cheek, In a similar - wound on the scalp
and -also- joined together the upper and
lower halves of the "miner's right ear.".
. Arthur. Burrows, a sailor, was accosted
by three. men on East street, just where,
he does < not remember. He sustained a
severely lacerated scalp," a j broken nose
and a deep cut under the right eye. .
Some of the Injured.
The belligerent striker'was in bold]evi
dence last night In the neighborhood of
the docks and wharves. He knocked men
down, he cut, kicked and robbed them. He
worked quickly and . openly. He was
vicious. of attack and. speedy of . retreat.
"HisvicUms went to the hospital all more
or loss bruised an<l mutilated. He and his
kind are still at. liberty in spite of- the ac
tivity, of the little police guard which is
doing active work in the strike district.
The police look for still more serious signs
of his activity in the- immediate future.
With the, vanishing. of 'the fear of mili
tia reinforcements for the police the cam
paign of violence along, the water, front,
which . had ceased for- a . spell, broke out
last night afresh and police officials and
hospital attendants had their hands full.
Tha expected break in the ranks^of -the
teamsters dM not Â¦materialize and the day
fora general, resumption of work is again
postponed. -Â¦' ) V * ' :Â¦Â¦Â¦ : Â¦ ' Â¦
