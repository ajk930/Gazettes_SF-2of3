Mr. Martin's i arrival at Newport will

delightful because they will be informal. -
Peter Martin, however, did not have to

As a result of this agreement every

troops.
Cause of the Battle.
The battle of to-day grew out of the
strike inaugurated on the Smuggler Union
mineV on May 1. The management of the
company for some two years prior to that
date had been letting contracts for break-
Ing part of the ore produced by the mines.
From the start the union complained
about the contract system of breaking
ore. claiming that a large number of the
contractors could not make wagea and
that some even came out in debt to the
company at the N end of the month. The
manager of the company was called on
by the local officers of the union and
asked that the contract system be either
abolished or the contractors guaranteed
district wages of $3 per day In case they
failed to earn it contracting. The man-
ager declined to secede to the request,
and a strike en this particular property
was ordered.
Mills Had Resumed "Work.
The mines and mills were shut down
and remained idle until the 17th of June,
when enough non-union men and union
men who were dissatisfied with the strike
returned to work in the mines t3 break
sufficient ore to keep one of the mills run
ning, the other being dismantled for re
pairs. "With this limited force the mill has
been kept steadily .running until , this
morning.
During this" time the local officers of the
union Interviewed the manager of the
company several times, "endeavoring to
bring about an amicable adjustment of
the difficulty, but their efforts were fu
tile. Some two weeks ago a Mr. Sullivan
of the executive committee of the "West
ern Federation of Miners arrived In Tellu
ride, consulted the manager and he also
was unable to accomplish anything. Tha
prolonged strike was having suet a de
pressing influence on the business inter
ests of Telluride that last Friday a com
mittee of business men and mine man
agers of Telluride was appointed to try to
satisfactorily adjust the controversy.
Owing to the absence of the manager of
the mine this committee has been, unable
to take any action.
The officials cf. the local union severely
denounce the violence resorted to this
morning. Since the resumption of work
on the mines a feeling of bitterness and'
resentment has been growing against the
miners who returned to work.
TROOPS IN READINESS
Governor Orman Acts Promptly la
the Miners' Riots. r ..
DENVER. Colo., July 3.â When Gov
ernor Orman received word, from Sheriff
Dowtain of Telluride telling him of the
riot at the Smuggler-Union mine and ask
ing for five hundred militia, he immediate â¢
ly issued a call for the companies locate!
at Denver- and Pueblo to assemble at
the armories and .await further orders.
Then began telegraphic correspendenca
between the San. Miguel office and th9
Governor, the latter asking definite In
formation as to the need for trooi>3. In
the meantime State Senator Buckley
wired the Governor not to order out troops
until he heard further from him. At 10:43
o'clock the Sheriff -wlred s the Governor
that the strikers had taken forcible pos
session of the mine during the truce and
had I run the employes over the range.
The latter made no resistance and at that
time everything w"as quiet, with the strik
ers guarding the property to prevent the
return of the men. The Governor decided
to disperse the troops, but It Is under
stood instructed them to be in readiness
to respond at a moment's call.
p-Â»T|--a ELL.URIDE, Colo., July / 3.â Great
% II excitement, which prevailed all
I day over a riot at the Smuggler
*--*' Union mines, is rapidly subsiding
this evening. A deadly controversy
has been satisfactorily adjusted for the
present and everything is quiet in Mar
shall and Savage basins.
Early this morning word was received
. in town that there was considerable
shooting agoing on at Smuggler at 5 o'clock
and many kinds of rumors were afloat.
The trouble is only a part of the strike
trouble which has been brewing for some
time. The first rumor to reach town was
that eight or ten had been killed, but this
provedv not to , be true. However, it Is
positive that Will Jordan was shot In the
right hip; Charles Becker,: superintendent
of the mine, had his right arm broken
and badly shattered from a bullet: Shift
Boss Nicholson was shot In the head, and
a Mexican trammer by the name of J.
Lujan and John Barthtell, a miner, were
killed.
Jordan was brought to town about 2
o'clock this afternoon by five of the men
who were working for him on the Sheri
dan dump. His- wound is quite painful,
but not necessarily serious.
Doctor Attends Wounded.
Dr. Sheldon .was called to the Bullion
tunnel to dress the wounds of the Injured
men, and sent a message about noon say
ing that Becker had a bad arm and that
Nicholson, who was shot in the head, has
a chance to live, but that is about all.
At that time those were the only men on
either side whose .wounds be had attend
ed to.
Most of the forenoon shots were ex
changed between the miners* deputies and
guards, but at 10 o'clock Â«ll,was quiet,
with the exception of a few shots now
and then. Some time this j forenoon one
of the cabins near the office building was
blown up, but it is impossible to learn
what damage, if any, was done.
The Liberty Bell and Tom Boy miners
have all practically gone out in sympathy
and those properties are all but idle in
the way of active operations. Miners are
seen coming over the range this morning
frcm the Ouray and Silverton sides, and
it is reported that the Camp Bird and
Revenue mines are also out in sympathy,
but as to these last named properties
there can be no verification. The Mayor
has ordered all saloons to be closed from
6 p. m. to 6 a. m., until otherwise notified.
Telephone wires have been cut and there
has been no communication between town
and Smuggler Hill all day.
About 6 o'clock this afternoon the corpse
of a man was brought to town from the
basin and it was found to be John Barth
tell. a Swedish miner, who was killed at
about the first shot fired. Barthtell was
fighting with the union miners.
All of the wounded except the last were
working in the mines.
How the Conflict Commenced.
As near as can bs learned the fight was
precipitated at the Sheridan tunnel which
is about three-quarters of a mile above
the Bullion tunnel, through which the
mines are worked and where the principal
boarding; and bunk houses and other
buildings and the upper terminal of the
main tramway are located.
During last night a number of union
miners went, up to a point near these
'places and at 5 o'clock this morning, it is
said, sent a man with a message to the
men working with William Jordan to the
effect that if they would stop work and
come down the hill there would be no
trouble. Â¦ In response to this message it
is said the union men were fired on, re
sulting in the instant killing of Barthtell.
Jordan and his crew then sought refuge In
an old tunnel and it^ was while running
for its mouth that Jordan was . shot
thrdugh the hips>At about 11 o'clock an op
portunity was offered to bring Jordan" to
town by an old and unused trail, all other
avenues to the basin being stronglj*
guarded by the union men. The firing
gradually worked down to Bullion tunnel.
, . Communication Is Cut.
Telephone wires leading "from town to
the mines in Marshall and Savage basin
were cut at an early hour and communica
tion shut off until a- late, hour this after
noon. It is impossible to learn any par
ticulars of the fighting, as both sides re
fuse to say anything.- During the day. all
kinds of rumors were rife, some that fif
teen men were ..killed., Late this evening
Dr. Sheldon, who went up this morning,
telephoned that ten men, including the four
mentioned, above, were ' injured and that
they would be sent down as rapidly as he
could dress their wounds. Dr. Sheldon was
shot through the hand by a stray bullet.
The Tom Boy . and Liberty Bell miners
who went to the - Smuggler early this
morning r compelled those properties to
close down and returned to their respect
ives mines this afternoon after it was an
nounced' that a temporary agreement had
been reached by the union arid Edgar Col
lins, .assistant manager. This agreement
is said to be that the company win
draw - all â¢ men from " the mines except a
few watchmen and make no effort to re-

NEW YORK, July 3.â The rain
storms of to-day, with the con
sequent fall In temperature, were
a godsend to the bulk of swelter
ing humanity in this city. As
soon as the last storm of the afternoon
had passed over the temperature imme
diately began to recede. The wind which
blew during the storm also commenced to
abate very rapidly, until it assumed the
proportions of a slight breeze only. These
atmospheric conditions, coupled with the
very considerable humidity which came
ts an aftermath of the downfall of water
from the clouds, made the suffering al
most as intense as It was when the ther
mometer had registered several degrees
higher.
Most of the hospitals are already crowd
ed to their utmost capacity, and many of
them have erected tents in their grounds
for the accommodation of the heat vic
tims.
Rapid Increase of Deaths.
The death rate has Increased with such
rapidity that the Morgue Is being taxed
as it never was before, and every avail
able foot of that institution is now occu
pied by corpses. Hospital attendants are
collapsing under the extraordinary strain
to which they have been subjected, and
were It not for the volunteers who have
come to their aid the situation would be
greatly aggravated by enforced neglect of
heat patients.
Although the ambulance service has
been augmented by the addition of auto
mobiles, which hare been* loaned 5 for the
purpose. It is greatly inadequate. The
horses used have been most carefully
nursed along to preserve their stamina,
but notwithstanding this many of- them
have given out. Their places are being
filled from outside sources, and so great is
the scarcity of available animals, because
of the combination of heat and grip with
which New York horses are afflicted, that
it has been necessary to send to other
cities to get a fresh supply.
Rain Reduces Temperature.
When the first downpour of rain struck
the city to-day it was accompanied by
thunder and a fair sized gale, which soon
reduced the temperature 15 degrees. The
humidity made the air so sultry, however,
that the great reduction was not percept
ible to the extent which most people
would imagine. At 12:30 p. m. the temper-,
ature registered S4 degrees, and hajf an,
hour later it had dropped two degrees.
Then it continued to fall as the rain and
â¢wind appeared, and at 3 o'clock It reg
istered only 76 degrees. By 4 p. m., how
ever, a rise of four degrees was noted. An
hour later the temperature dropped back
one point. Then It went forward again,
and at 5 p. m. it was 77 degrees, and 6
o'clock 78 and at S o'clock SO degrees.
The wind and lightning, which accom
panied the rain, did much damage in the
city, especially out toward Harlem. Many
trees, awning? and buildings were Injured,
but up to 10 o'clock no casualties had been
reported.
Death and Prostration.
There were eighty-nine deaths and 107
cases of heat prostration in the boroughs
of Manhattan and the Bronx during the
hours between 2 a. m. and 10:30 p. m. to
day.
At 12:30 o'clock this (Thursday) morning
It was estimated that the total number of
deaths from heat in the last six days In
Greater New York were 600.
BALTIMORE'S HOT WAVE.
ported Up to Midnight.
Twenty-Seven Additional Deaths Re-
BALTIMORE. Md.. July 3.âTwenty
eeven additional deaths from heat were
reported to the police dp to midnight to
night. Of these fifteen died yesterday but
were not resorted until to-day. Thirty
flve cases of prostration Is the record for
the twenty-four hours ending to-night.
The grand total thus far Is eighty-three
deaths and more than S00 cases of pros
tration. While the maximum tempera
ture for the day was not so high as that
of yesterday, the relative humidity was
greater and the oppressiveness much more
severe. The highest point attained by the
mercury was reported at 3 p. m..' when it
showed 97. six degrees lower than the top
r-oint of yesterday. Shortly after 4 o'clock
a brisk wind and a brief thunderstorm
cooled the air and the mercury dropped
to 84 at S p. in., at which point it remained
until midnight.
DISTRESS IN PHILADELPHIA
for Those Prostrated.
Many Emergency Measures to Care
PHILADELPHIA. July 3.â Although
the temperature did not reach the record
5t made yesterday and Monday by four
degrees, the suffering from the heat and
the fatal results from the torrid wave
Â¦were nearly as great as on the two pre
vious days. The maximum temperature
to-day was reached at 2 p. m., when the
Weather Bureau thermometer registered
S& 2-10 degrees. . An approaching thunder-
storm then sent the mercury downward,
and at 8 o'clock to-night, when the, storm
arrived, the tempera tare had gone down
to 80 degrees. Humidity, however, then
began to play Its deadly part. The storm
brought only a light shower of rain,
â¢which was soon dried up by the sun
baked streets, and the percentage of hu
midity went up from 40 to 45, leaving the
city still in an uncomfortable state. |
Up to midnight the number of deaths
attributed to the excessive heat reported
since last midnight was 47, and the pros
trations over 250. The further .reports
from the police stations and hospitals will
considerably increase these numbers. Yes
terday there were more than 50 deaths
and over 300 prostrations. _, ;
Hundreds of horses have perished since
the hot spell began. Many industrial es
tablishments were again either shut down
or working short hours. It was estimated
that only one-third of the working popu
lation of the Kensington manufacturing
district was at work to-day. *
In order that . heat patients can be
promptly attended to the city authorities
have Issued orders that policemen may
seize any near-by team so as to get a pa
tient to a hospital quickly. Tents have
been erected In various parts of the city
to care for the prostrated.
Reports from interior towns of the
State indicate only slight moderation in
the excessive heat of the two previous
days. Nearly all report further prostra
tions, with here and there a death directly
attributable to the heat.

WASHINGTON, July 3.â Hot weather
continued to-day in nearly all sections
east of the Rocky Mountains, but
as a rule showed some, abatement from
the previous day. Reports received at
the Weather Bureau show that
temporary relief came from thunder
showers In many localities. There are no
Immediate prospects of a general break
in the hot spell. During the afternoon
showers In the Upper Ohio Valley and the
Middle Atlantic States caused a. decided
fall In the temperature. Almost similar
conditions are expected to-morrow, except
that the area over which the storms may
appear may be extended. The slight dis
turbance noted last night in the West In
dies Is not making any marked advance
and the relief hoped for in that direction
is not materializing. The area of low
pressure In the Lake Superior region is
moving very slowly .to the northeast and
remains practically Mifeless, so that lit
tle relief is expected from that source. It
will be warm again in the morning,
Weather Bureau officials say, and the
only appreciable breaks In temperature
will result from local storms.
Ninety degrees and over were recorded

Hot weather generally prevailed in
Kansas and Missouri, these States getting
little relief.
In Washington the thermometer reached
a maximum of 96, but toward evening it
grew gradually cooler, until at 8 oldock
SO degrees prevailed. There were fifteen

WASHINGTON, July 3.-No official in

Warner-Quinlan syndicate has taken pos
session of the Felicldad asphalt property
under authority of a decree from the
State Court in Venezuela, and that after
ward the New York and Bermudez Com
pany had re-entered with a strong guard.
Â¦The department has unofficial informa
tion that the Warner-Quinlan Company
had what purported to be an order from
the State Court authorizing it to , take
possession, but that the court in Caru
pano subsequently declared this order to
be invalid and refused to issue an order
giving it possession. In view of this
decision by the Carupano court and re
peated statements or President Castro
that the matter Is to be left to the courts
it is believed by the State Department
that the President will' not furnish; mili
tary support to the Warner-Quinlan Com
pany, and it is believed that no further
attempts will be made to oust the New
York and Bermudez Company pending a
decision of the Supreme Court on the
question of ownership.- - -
Quinlan will petition the Government
on behalf of his .syndicate that troops
maintain possession of the mines. This
request, it Is thought, will be granted.
It is probable that a conflict will take

THE OFFICIALS
PITTSBURG, July 3.â There were
few developments to-day in the
strike situation of the sheet steel
and hoop workers. Neither of the
combines affected has seemingly
made any attempt to break the solid front
of the men at any of the union plants.
They still announce that mills not running
this week are shut down for repairs.
President Shaffer of. the Amalgamated
Association stated this morning that he
had called upon officers of the independ
ent sheet plants in reference to the recent
cut in prices made by the sheet combine,
and they all agreed that the reduction
was made to keep the independent con
cerns out of the market.
- "If they persist in this," said, he, "I will
call a conference with the independent
people next year and arrange a scaie with
them."
"When asked if he expected any develop
ments soon he said:
"I expect to get into communication:
with the combine people soon. They called
for me by long-distarice telephone yester
day, but when I reached the office I was
unable to get them. I am to call them up
Boon and there may be some results."
"When seen later President Shaffer said
the telephonic 'nterview with the combine
officials had been unsatisfactory on ac- .
count of the wire condition and was bar
ren of results.

The order enjoined the defendants from
picketing or patrolling around the fac
tories of the plaintiffs and from guarding
the doors or the streets in front of the
factories and from interfering in any way
â¢with employes now in the factories. It also
forbids the use of violence, threats or in

Attorneys for the defendants complained
that the allowance of a temporary injunc

After an extended hearing counsel for tha

George Dodwell Practically
Confirms Report of
-Transfer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, July 3.â The report of tha
transfer of the Northern Pacific steam
ship line to the big transportation corn
bine of J. Pierpont Morgan and James J.
Hill is practically confirmed, by Georga
Dodwell, head of the firm of Dodwell &
Co., owners of the line. Dodwell, who
was in Seattle to-day, declared the report
of the sale to be premature, but made no
denial. Well informed transportation
men here, who have followed the move
ments of Morgan and Hill very closely,
say that the transfer of the control of the
Northern Pacific line has already been
made and It Is now a part o:f the around
the-world- combination. The line will con
tinue to be operated from Tacoma. in con
nection with the Northern Pacific, but
will bear the friendly relation with the
Nippon Yusen Kaisha,. the Great North
ern steamship line from Seattle, that ia
known to exist between the two trans
continental railways.
Another important move was made here
to-day, closely connected with the opera
tions of the big combination and looking
to the amalgamation of Important inter
ests in Puget Sound and Alaska transpor
tation, now represented separately by
Dodwell & Co.'s Washington and Alaska
Steamship Line and the line of the Pa
cific Coast Company. A conference was
held here, attended by George Dodwell,
Fred Dodwell, hl3 brother and partner;
J. D. Farell, president of the Pacific Coast
Company; Samuel H. Piles, attorney for
the latter company; Hugh C. Wallace of
the Northern Pacific Steamship Company
and James M. Ashton. lately attorney of
the Northern Pacific and owner of a num
ber of Puget Sound craft. The confer
ence. It is said, looks to the consolidation
of the Dodwell and Pacific Coast Com
pany lines to Southeastern Alaska, and,
further, to the Pacific Ccast Company ob
taining control of the Dodwell and other
steamers plying between Puget Sound
ports and Victoria, B. C. As is well
known, the Pacific Coast Company is iden
tified with the Great Northern Railway,
while the local and Alaskan lines of the
DoOwells have always handled the North
ern Pacific business.
The combination to-day made an offer
to Ashton to purchase the Sound steam
ship State of "Washington and to John II.
Thompson for the purchase of the newly
launched Majestic, which was built for
the Victoria run. Both vessels, It Is said,
will be procured.
The ultimate intention of the Hill-Mor
gan interests, as made plain by recent de
velopments, is to control the large share
of trade from the ports of Puget Souni
to the California ports by the Pacific
Coast Company, to Alaska by the Pacific
Coast and Dodwell lines and to the Orient
by the Northern Pacific Steamship Com
pany and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha.
GREAT NORTHERN
SLASHES RATES
Railroad War Begins for
the Summer Tourist
Business.
ST. PAUL, July 3.â The Great Northern
to-day met the action of the westward
lines through Kansas City and Omaha in
placing low rates In effect to Salt Lake
and Denver for the summer tourist busi
ness by cutting first-class rates to Mon
tana points and Spokane to the lowest
figures they have ever reached. The ac
tion was without warning and precipitates
a severe fight for the summer movement
west.
The new Great Northern rate to Bu]tte.
Helena, Great Falls and the principal
Montana point3 is $15, with a limit of
August 13. and gives a round-trip for only
$3 more than the present first-class fare.
The Spokane return rate Is 540. The new
rates will go Into effect Saturday and
will continue for one week.
Officials of the road were unable to state
whether the new rates would be continued
more than a week. It Is probable that the
action of the Great Northern will be fol
lowed by a similar announcement from
the Northern Pacific.

NEW ORLEANS, July 3.â The South

great revival in the last few days. Four
British transports have reached here this

j and four more are dated to arrive during
the week. One thousand mules left on the
Jamaican to-day, BOO mules and horses go
to-morrow, 1500 mules and 1000 horses the
next day. British officers think the pres
ent activity will continue until Christmas.
The British Government has 8000 head of
mules and 7000 horses at Kansas City,
which will be shipped to New- Orleans as
fast as vessels here can load them.
Dr. E. B. Richardson, who has Just re
turned from South Africa, where he has
been in charge of shipments of mules and
horses. Bays the more experience British
officers have with American animals the
better pleased they are. Richardson
thinks the British are very hard on
horses, and the heavy loss of animals is
due to this strain. The horses are allowed
only one day's rest after a sea voyage of
a month and are then hurried forward to
the seat of war. They are put into actual
service at once and get no rest from that
time forward until they are worn out.

GLOBE, Ariz., July 3.â The fire that
broke out yesterday in Knight Parker's
two-story frame building was caused by
fhlidren experimenting at developing ko
dak pictures. The conflagration spread
southerly, destroying the G. S. Van
Wagenen liquor store and lodging-house,
and threatened to cross Pinal Creek in
spite of the efforts of the locaJ nre com
pany. Suddenly the wind shifted and
saved the town.
The conflagration then turned north and
east, laying the block in ashes on both
Fides of Broad street from the Van Wage
ncn building to the Cochot residence, in
clusive.
The losers and their approximate losses,
after considering insurance, are as fol
lows: Knteht Parker, $2000; Mrs. Grant
Allison. $2000; G. S. Van Wagenen, $3000;
Pascual Xigre. $1000; McKibbett. $3000;
Mrs. Cochot, $1500; Lee Middleton, $800; J.
P. McNeill, ?2500. The personal and inci
dental losses are serious.
The fire, while destroying a few valu
able buildings, operated principally in the
poorest part of the camp, the whole of the
business part of Globe narrowly escaping
by the change of wind and the unprece
dented efforts of the fire company. No

were in charge of expert vaqueros, but
despite the best efforts of the men the
horses were not rounded up till long past
midnight and were then far out of town.

animals scattered and ran in every direc

streets of the town and along the beach,
where there were many people, and others
rushing through the open gates of the Del
Monte grounds, over the flower beds and
lawns, through shrubbery "and past guests,

that it was impossible for her to regain
her feet.

any too soon, for Mrs. Burnett was thor

the breakers. Mrs. King could not man

ALTURAS, July 3. â Out of the lynching
of old Calvin Hall, his three sons and
Daniel Yantis at Lookout there have de
volved feuds and bitter quarrels that
threaten te involve the people of Modoc
County for years to come. One of the
most sensational incidents resulting from
the lynching occurred to-day, when Su
perior Judge Harrington gave Attorneys
J. E. 'Raker and G. F. Harris the alter
native of paying fines of $500 each or serv
ing five days in the County Jail for con
tempt of court In all probability the
two will serve time rather than pay the
heavy fines.
Raker and Harris appeared' . before
Judge Harrington to-day and applied for
a writ of habeas corpus in the cases of
R. H. Leventon, Isom Eades and J. <W.
Brown, who are under indictment for
having led the mob that lynched the
Halls. They asked that the defendants
be released, alleging that Judge Harring
ton and District Attorney Bonner had
given Witness Colburn "money to remain
in Alturas and testify against the de
fendants; that when Colburn became
frightened and started to leave town the
District Attorney had him placed in Jail
for safe keeping.
Judge Harrington became furious over'
the contents of this application for a writ
of habeas corpus,- and after a terrific
tongue lashing he pronounced sentence
upon the attorneys for contempt of court.
The Judge gave them until July 5 to pay
the money or go to jail.
The attorneys for Leventon, Cades &
Brown, on Monday applied to the court
to learn who sent certain telegrams to
the newspapers in regard to indictments
being found against the prisoners by the
Grand Jury. It seems that the prisoners
under arrest have not been shown the in
dictments against them and have not
been informed officially of the charge un
der which they were arrested, so they
are standing upon the constitutional pro
vision that it is unlawful to detain a man
in prison without Informing him of the
charge against him. They claim that,
while they are kept in ignorance of the
charge, the newspapers are informed of
the secret proceedings of the Grand Jury
and the court.

man, who was about five feet six Inches
in height. He wore a mask over his face
and sacks on his feet and carried a double
barreled shotgun.
The outlaw commanded Driver Henry
Crockett to stop. Crockett replied in a
jocular way, and the command was re
peated. Crockett shouted that he would
be."cussed" If he would stop, whereupon
the robber shot the horse nearest him.
Having thus brought: the coach to a
halt, the highwayman commanded the
driver and the passengers, five in num
ber, to throw out their purses and Wells-
Fargo's box. About $20 was thrown upon
the ground, together with the box, which
contained $50 in money billed to J. G.

VICTORIA, B. C. July 3.â "ThÂ© Nippon
Tusen Kaisha's steamer Takasagro Maru.
which arrived here from Cheru," says
the Nagasaki Press of June 17, "appears
to have had a " narrow escape from de
: struction, as she was fired on by a Brit
1 ish warship outside .the Island of Linkung
tao. The mail steamer left Chef u, and
when she was running- on a course from
Eddy ''Island to a point two miles off
Â¦ the Â¦ Shantung promontory two British
', warships â the cruiser. Terrible and the
battleship Oceanâ supposed to have been
engaged in gun practice, . made their ap
pearance off iWelhaiwei. A distance of
about seven miles separated the Japanese
steamer from the; two -warships. One
of the passengers, who was watching
through his glasses the movements on
the British vessels, remarked that the
battleship was preparing to fire. Shortly
after this a shot fell into the water at
a distance of 200 yards from the steamer,
on her starboard side. The steamer pro
ceeded on her way, but one of the pas
sengers advised the officers to display the
ship's flag in order to show the nation
ality of the vessel. This advice was not
followed.
"The vessel had covered another three
miles when the passenger who was
watching through his glasses said that
the battleship was again preparing to
.fire. This time the shot came much
closer and fell about 100 yards from the
steamer. The second shot caused great
consternation among the passengers, who
beseeched the captain to heave to and
show his colors. This the captain did by
-hoisting a large Japanese flag on the
main topmast. This flag was seen by
the warships, which then disappeared
from the scene and the Japanese steamer
resumed her journey.'.'

When there is a natural and healthy circulation of the blood, the entire
quantity, estimated at one-eighth the weight of the body, passes through the heart
every five minutes. This rapid flow of the blood through the system prevents the
entrance of disease germs and impurities of every description. It filters out all that
is not necessary or good for the growth and development of the body and nourish-'
ing and strengthening the muscles, tissues,' nerves and bones. But, unfortunately,
few persons can rightly cjl&n an absolutely pure blood supply and perfect and
unpolluted circulation, ana in consequence are exposed to innumerable diseases.
Contagious Blood Poison, the greatest enemy- to mankind, enters the system
through the blood, , and Cancer, Scrofula, Rheumatism, Catarrh, Eczema, Salt
Rheum, Psoriasis, Tetter-^- in fact the majority of human ailments â are caused by
poisons or humors that are engen- Â»Â«^Â» Â¦ â¢ .#>

and impoverished blood. Old ' m 'Â¦ __*
sores, chronic ulcers and rheumatic pains are com- OÂ« ASS StfGtlOiSt
mon, especially among old people,^jyhose blood
naturally grows thin and palebecause of the lack of the red corpuscles that give
color and strength to youthful blood. Sallow complexions and rough, oily skins
evidence some constitutional or blood trouble, -which salves, lotions, powders nor
any, external treatment can cure. Diseases that originate in the blood, -whether
they manifest themselves as ulcers, tumors, itching eruptions, muscular or bone
pains, require a tonic and blood purifier such as S. S. S., which not only antidotes
and neutralizes blood poisons and humors, but possesses health-giving tonic proper- !
Â¦ ties that no other blood medicine does. Â¦ It goes down to the very foundation of

BtÂ°BQtSS DlSBS&SB new strength and vitality to the old innutritious
.blood, and when the arteries and veins are once
more filled with new rich blood/ the general health begins to improve, muscles
grow stronger, and sores and eruptions of every kind disappear.
'".'Â¦ S^S.S. is the only guaranteed purely vegetable .blood purifier, and the purest
and most reliable in all blood diseases. It has been tested in thousands of cases

Will Sail for Wallace Trophy.
To-day the annual contest will be held
for the Wallace Trophy of the California
Yacht Club over the usual course from
the southerly pierhead .of the narrow
gauge mole to and around Presidio Shoal
buoy, leaving the same on the port hand;
then to the finish across the startling line.
The trophy is at present he.ld by Vice
Commqdore Sagar's sloop Edna of the
Corinthian -Yacht Club. The contestants
will be Commodore S. S. Marshall's sloop
Thelma, the sloop Jessie E. and probably
also the sloop Pactolus. These dropped
down the creek and anchored off the, mole
yesterday. . .
The Corinthian Yacht Club received an
invitation to Napa City for to-day and
the following two days, but as it -was
Polo Pony Races at
Hobart's Track.
As was expected the second day of the
championship tennis tournament was pro
ductive of much better tennis than the
first day. Â¦Â¦"Â¦, . Â¦ ' . .
The. first match yesterday was between
Merle ; Johnson and John Hoffmann. The
latter got away: well, but when Johnson
got fairly started he proved much too
strong for his left-handed ppponent. Hoff
man made a good stand In the last set,
when the score was 5 â 1 against him, pull
ing it up to 4â5. The complete score in
favor of Johnson was 7â5, 6â1, 6â4.
. The next match was between Grant
Smith and Alex Stuart of Oakland, and
proved to be very one-sided. The score in
Smith's favor was '6â0, 6â0, 6â1.
One of the best matches of .the tourna
ment was between R. N. Whitney and
Fred Brown. Both players ran in on their
service and were- continually fighting for
the net. Brown played a very good net
game, while Whitney shone in the back
court. The latter's drives, both fore and
back hand, were 'exceedingly swift and ac
curate and won the day for him. The first
two sets fell to Whitney, 6 â 4, 6 â 4. In the
third and final set Brown ran the score up
to 5â 2 in his favor -and Â»it began to look
as' if he would win "the set easily, >but
Whitney took a brace and pulled it up to
5â5. At this point the real struggle com
menced,- and after some long and fierce
rallies Whitney finally came out a win
ner. The score in his favor was 6â 4, 6â4,
9â7. â¢
: ' This ' brought play to the semi-finals, in
which George Whitney was pitted against
Merle Johnson and R. N. Whitney against
Grant Smith. Champion Whitney was in
better form yesterday than on the pre
vious day and had little trouble in dis
posing df Johnson, â¢whom he defeated In
three straight sets. The score in Whit
ney's, favor was 6â1, 6â2, 6â 2. ,By win
ning this match Whitney . is entitled to
play in the finals to-day.
The last match of the day was between
Jt. N. Whitney and Grant Smith and, al
though the former won In straight sets,
the contestants were evenly matched and
the play was very close. In the first set
every game was deuce and vantage, but
most of them went to Whitney. "With the
score 3â0 against him Smith pulled iip'to
3â3 and 30 love, but > lost: the next three
games. In the second set Smith seemed
discouraged and Whitney won easily. In
the last set Whitney won 1 thej first two
gaTne3, but the next four, went j to Smith.
The latter made a fine stand in this set,
but Whitney was right on edge and won
out, 7â5. Smith .was in poor condition and
seemed somewhat off in his game.
The two third .prizes will -go to Merle
Johnson and Grant Smith. At 2:30 to-day
the Whitney brothers will settle the ques
tion of supremacy.
i Bob Whitney has been putting up a
great game of late, while his brother
George seems to have lost some of his
former skill. The former is picked by most
people to win the match to-day and there
by become the champion of California.
The drawing for the consolation tourna
ment was held yesterday afternoon and
resulted as follows: \J. Craig vs. R. Ers
kine; C. Elston a bye; J. Hoffmann vs.
Carl Gardner: C. Kuehn vs. C. Smith; O.
Hoffmann a bye; W. B. Collier vs. J. D.
MacGavin.
One match was played in the consolation
tournament and resulted in a victory for
MacGavin over Collier, the score being
8â6, 1â6, 7â5. Both men played good ten

footer. Constitution has not proved definite
ly her superiority to the 1899 champion, the
Columbia, for the second " contest to-day
between the two big racers was nipped in
the bud through the unfortunate buckling
of the Columbia's martingale, when the
yachts had sailed nearly three miles of
the race. The accident took place when
the boats were sailing very fast on the
wind and so close were they that there is
considerable difference of opinion as to
what the outcome would, have been had
they continued on their ten-mile beat to
the first mark, the race being a triangular
one of thirty miles. . *â¢
Columbia again crossed the smarting line
ahead of her rival, just eighteen seconds in
the lead,' and had established herself in a
good berth to the weather of the Con
stitution. Many of the yachts which fol
lowed the boats believe that in three short
miles the old boat pointed higher and
footed as fast as the. Constitution, while
there are others who are equally certain
that; the Constitution,, while admittedly
behind, was nevertheless forereaching
the Columbia and- would have eventually
beaten her to the first mark.' .;. -
The Columbia had the advantage of the
use of her baby jibtopsail at the start,
while the Constitution did not set hers

' The Pennsylvanians won their heat in
great style. They were never extended
and it is now freely admitted by those
who thought the Leanders had a certainty
for the Grand Challenge Cup that the
Americans are extremely dangerous.
"I don't like the looks of it," said the
Triumph of the Americans.
The Pennsylvanians came down to their
boathouse at 11:30 a. m. They all declared
themselves fit and confident. "Bob"

"No American crew was ever at Henley
with better prospects. They are in splen

In my opinion, meet Leander In the finals,
when. I fear, the Englishmen will beat
them." a&IW
The regatta began under favorable con
ditions. The sun was bright and warm
and a cool breeze was blowing off the
lowpath. J The attendance, however, did
not equal expectations', and in no way
equaled Yale's year. Comparatively few
American flags or prominent Americans
were visible.

The Pennsylvanians, after their heat for
the Grand Challenge cup, which they
won, disembarked at their boathouse ap
parently as fresh as when they left it.
There was no sign- of exhaustion on the
part of any member of the crew. The
stroke, Gardiner, said:
"We pulled pretty lively at the finish,
but there was no time in the race when
we had any doubt about the result."
Ellis Ward, the coach, said:
"The crew did the work to-day which I
expected. Their performance, I believe,
was most creditable. But, to me, it was
in no wise a surprise. There was no ad
vantage whatever in the stations to-day,
and all the conditions of the race and the
management were as perfect as any one
could desire. I can say no more about

The most encouraging feature was the

Angels Against Frisco.
"Won. Lost. P. C.
After an absence of four â¢weeks the Los
Angeles team returns to-day to play a se
ries of six games with San Francisco.
The two teams are billed for a double at
traction at the ball grounds to-day. A
postponed game will be played off in the
forenoon, starting at 10:30, and play will
be resumed, with a change of pitchers, at
2:30 in the afternoon.
The Los Angeles players have been pre
senting a fine quality of ball since their
last appearance in this .city. They have
won. nine out of twelve games and are
now in a position to dispute with the
Germans over first place. They have been
strengthened somewhat by the acquisi
tion of Henry Reltz, who was formerly
with the famous Baltimore team in the
days when it was invincible. Through
failure to keep in condition he was unable
to stay with fast company, but he lately
rounded into form and is now playing with
his old-time dash. The Orange Growers
have also signed a new pitcher named
Wittredge, who was lured from an East
ern minor league.
Following is the line-up for the morn
ing game: Â¦ Â¦â¢ . .-. '

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
THE Kosmos liner Hermonthis,
which arrived from Hamburg via
South and Central American ports
yesterday, had a very hard time of
It in the Atlantic. Bad weather in
the English Channel, a pampero off the
Platte and a hurricane lasting three days
off the Straits of Magellan were some of
the experiences.
When the Hermonthis was Rearing
Sandy Point, at the entrance to the
straits. It began to blow. The sea got up
very quickly and the vessel began to la
bor. For twenty-four hours, with the en
gines going full speed, not a mile of
progress was made. The decks were
swept, ventilators carried away, cabins
flooded and the hull strained. Captain
Knudsen says that in ten years he never
experienced anything to compare with
that three days* gale.
Passing through the Straits of Magellan
the crew of the steamship saw a good
deal of the Patagonians. They used to
c-cme alongside every night when the ves
sel anchored and barter skins for odds
and ends. At Valparaiso the Hermonthis
was detained fourteen days. Nearly all
the time it blew a gale, and Captain
Knudsen took advantage of the delay to
fix up three plates that were damaged ln
the storm off Sandy Point and make oth
er necessary repairs.
At all the Central American and Mexi
can ports the Hermonthis was delayed,
and in consequence she Is away behind
time. From here she goes to Puget Sound
and will come oack to finish loading. She
is the largest vessel of the Kosmos fleet.
leing 3096 tons net burden. 3S2 feet long,
4S feet 2 inches beam and 26 feet 2 inches
deep. This is Captain Knudsen's first visit
to San Francisco in a steamship, but he
was here twenty-five years ago in a saiU
ing vessel. The Hermonthis comes into
port in splendid shape, and Chief Steward
Fordsen has the cabins and staterooms
looking like those on a yacht.
The Hermonthis brought up the follow
ing named cabin passengers:
Jucn Rios, George Schmuck, Francisco Bo
pan, Miss Paula Schoeffer and maid, Panta
leon Eaauerra, Miss Marie Esquerra, Carlos
Linga and Candalarla Ochoa.
Mr. Esquerra is the head of the Mazat

comes here for medical treatment. Mr.

IS THE BALAENA A WRECK?
Shipping 1 ilen Seem to Think There
Is a Mistake.
A dispatch frcm Seattle published yester
day morning states that the steam whaler
Balaena was wrecked on St. Lawrence Isl
and en May 1 and that Captain "P. F.
Cotte" and his crew had been saved, but
had endured much hardship before being
finally rescued. In whaling circles and
among shipping men the impression is
that the Balaena is all right, and that
the wreck was probably that of the steam
whaler William Baylies.
The William Baylies left here on March
32 for the Arctic in command of Captain
S. F. Cottle. while the Balaena left April
7 in command of Captain Leavitt. The
Baylies would be in the vicinity of St.
Lawrence Island about May 1, but the
chances are all against the Balaena get
ting there by that time, even if she went
all the way under steam, which is not
probable. Then Captain "P. F. Cotte" is
very like S. F. Cottle, and not a bit like
Leavitt. From these facts seafaring men
argue that next advices will show that it
â¢was the Baylies and not the Balaena that
was wrecked. Then again Captain Cottle
of the Baylies may have taken the news
to Nome and In that way got his name
mixed up in the wreck. The St. Paul,
which will be due next Sunday, should
bring full particulars of the disaster.

23 First Street, Ban Francisco.TWO or three days of hot weather tell on horses more than on human be
ings. To prevent heat prostration, a straw bonnet is the latest novelty for
horses in Philadelphia. It is designed to shade the animal's head, keep
ing the brain center cool. The Philadelphia Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals has adopted the device and reconimends it to horse
owners.
Dolly and Colonel, the team of grays that hauls the society's ambulance, have
been equipped with the unique sombreros. The conical crowned skypieces are
held in place by bands of bright red, tied In a bow around the neck. Two open
ings in the brim admit the horse's ears and insure stability.
It is proposed to distribute these bonnets in needy cases called to the society's
attentionâ cart horses, owned singly by poor men who can't afford luxuries for
themselves, let alone their horses. The brim of the hat does not fit tightly
over the head. There is space for the breeze to play. The crown wards off the
penetrating sunbeams and lends a chic air. The straw is of light, perforated
variety, woven in one piece.
As the summer waxes warmer straw hats for horses will be In greater de
mand.

IN ANSWER TO
QUESTIONS OF

It la much easier, to collect , a crowd
than a dollar for charity. '
The'subject is not one that requires much exhorta
tion. It is well known that there will be a great many
firecrackers exploded in all parts of the city during
the day, and the evening. In thousands of. instances
the papers of the exploded crackers, still burning with
slow fires, will be blown about by the winds and may
be carried into almost any yard or alley way. If then
there be left about the city any rubbish piles contain
ing inflammable material or bits of papfr scattered
about the yards or alley ways, there will b'e danger of
fire. It will not be difficult for each householder and
property owner to see to it that no>asily ignited sub
stance is left on his property within reach of explod
ing crackers. To that duty he should give his atten
tion before starting upon the celebration of the day.*
NO man's holiday will be marred by the exercise
of due. care to prevent an outbreak of fire
resulting from the use of fireworks and fire
crackers in t the celebration . of the day. Carefulness
will cost nothing, but carelessness may cost an enor
mous sum. It has many times occurred in these.United
States that fires entailing a loss running into the mill
ions were caused by a firecracker starting a blaze that
at first could have been extinguished in a moment and
almost without exertion.

"Itis sufficient to state these facts to
show that the possibility of signaling to

human resources." â¢
"The very largest city that this earth
has ever known would be altogether too
small to be visible to a being dwelling on
the planet Mars, even if that being: were
endeavoring to see it with a telescope as
powerful as the greatest and most perfect
instrument in any observatory on this
globe. . : *
"If the . whole extent of Lake Â¦ Superior
was covered with petroleum, and if that
petroleum was set on fire, then I think
we may admit that an inhabitant of
Mars who was furnished with a telescope
as good as that which j Percival. Lowell
uses at Flagstaff, might be able to see
that' something had happened. But we
must not suppose that the mighty con
flagration would-'appear, to. the Martian
as a very conspicuous object. It would
rather be a very small feature, but still
I think it would not be beyond the reach
of a practiced observer in that planet.'
On the other hand, if an area the size
of Lake Superior on Mars was be
flooded with petroleum and that j petro

pect to ; witness the event ' from here not
as a great and striking conflagration, .but

MORE MONEY NEEDED.
FROM the committee in charge of the work of
preparing for the convention of the Epworth
League there has been issued an appeal for addi
tional subscriptions to the funds required for the
work. At the time this city was fixed upon as the
place for holding the convention it was agreed by the
representatives of San Francisco that the sum of
$25,000 should be raised to defray expenses. Prepara
tions have been made on that basis and they cannot
be changed. It appears that . up to this time only
$14,000 has been subscribed It will be seen there is
urgent need for prompt subscriptions.
This is a good day to think the matter over and
decide how much you can give. The Epworth League
is one of the largest organizations of its kind in the
world. It represents character, religion and youth. Its
members are just the kind of people we wish to have
interested in California, i Many thousands of them will
attend the convention, and it will be well worth' our
while to give them the kind of entertainment which
has made us famous for hospitality.
San Francisco cannot afford to fail in this under
taking. The convention will attract the attention of
the whole United States, for the delegates are to come
from all sections. We wish these bright young men
and young women to be pleased with our city so that
they will carry to their homes good reports of us. To
that end everybody should contribute. Ii each gives a
little no one need give much.

PERSONAL MENTION.
THE GLORIOUS FOURTH.
ONCE more the people of the" United States
are called upon to celebrate the anniversary of
the Declaration of Independence. The man
ner of the celebration will be that which has come
down to us from the days of the fathers of the repub
lic. Throughout the land the people will to-day
respond to the words of the poet: *^:.-
Go, ring the bells and tiro the guns
And fling the starry banners out;
Shout "Freedom" till your lisping ones
Give back their cradle shout.
Â¦ In an especial sense the day has become the great
holiday of the American boy. It is, his day of freedom
with a full right to wave banners, beat 'drums, sound
trumpets and explode crackers and roman candles to
his heart's content! This element in the celebration
gives it an enthusiam that never grows old. It remains
immortally young with the youth of the land, and will
be as joyously and as nd*isily hailed to-day as when it
was first greeted by the boys of the brave days of old.
While there has been no change in the celebration
of the day by^, the boys' there has been considerable
change in the tone and temper of the oratory which
forms so important a feature in the celebration of
adults. In the early days Fourth of July oratory "was
such an exuberant outburst of perfervid rhetoric that
it became something of a jest even among the most
patriotic. Only now and then did some Webster,
Everett or Prentiss deliver a Fourth of July oration
that men delighted not only to hear but to read. In
our time that early fervor is well nigh gone. The
orators who hold the attention of the American people
to-day will be expected to deal with some of the more
serious problems and issues that confront the nation.
Instead of the glowing rhetoric and flowery phrases of
the former oratory there will be earnest thought, and
it is a safe prediction that from many of the speakers
there will come almost as much of warning as of glori
fication.
The change in the style of oratory corresponds with
a change in the dignity and responsibility of the
people. The republic has now become the foremost
nation of this age, and is unquestionably the mightiest
that ever existed. It holds Within its domain the
largest extent of fertile land that was ever included in
one country, whether republic or empire;- it has in its
population a larger number of energetic, educated, law
abiding men than ever before sustained any govern
ment, and its power for industry, for commerce or for
war is so vast that it could withstand the assaults of all
other nations combined.
In the deep consciousness of this national power
and magnitude, the American people no longer feel a
desire for oratorical exaggeration. We have become
sobered by the responsibilities of greatness. We are
aware that with our increased wealth and strength
there have come increased duties to the world. Our
republic no longer stands alone. Our flag flies over
islands in both the Eastern and the Western Indies.
Our troops have served as allies of those of European
nations in the war in China. We have become a world
power and must adopt a world policy having obliga
tions which we must fulfill as well as rights which we
must maintain.
It is not our foreign relations only that have
changed. Within the republic itself there are growing
up many problems that force themselves upon public
attention and compel the consideration of thoughtful
men. These come naturally to the mind whenever a
review is made of the advancing prosperity and great
ness of the country. Never before in all human history
has there been a nation that rose so quickly and so
peacefully to the highest rank; nor. is there one
whose prospects at home or abroad are so gratifying
to the ardent patriot. But the very brightness of all
that is around us serves but to show more clearly how
much danger there is that we may become intoxicated
by empire or by commercialism, and, for the sake of
wealth or power, barter away our ancient heritage of
peace and freedom. Â¦
When full consideration has been given to all the
serious aspects of the situation of the people or of the
nation^ the healthful thinker will find no cause for
doubting the future grandeur of the republic or the
happiness of those who live beneath its flag. The
ideals of liberty and law expressed in the great declar
ation and embodied in the constitution hold the first
place in the minds of American youth as well as in the
minds of their fathers. With each return of this hol
iday the people dedicate themselves anew to the im
mortal principles which have come down to us from
the men of 1776. So it is with.us to-day, and so it will
be with true Americans for all time to come. There
may be times of doubt, times of mistakes and times
of wrongs, but always the common sense and patriot
ism of the majority will suffice to rectify the course of
the nation and make sure that a government of the
people, by the people, for the people shall not perish
from the face of the earth.
The most cheerful optimist of the country is an un
known man whom a Philadelphia' reporter met on one
of the hottest days of the season, and who, when told
of the number of sunstrokes and prostrations in the
city, said: "This is good weather for corn."
THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIMARIES
BY the advisory committee of the* Republican
Primary League there has been adopted a series
of resolutions indorsing the objects and pur
poses of the league and commending "the faithful and
honest work thus far carried on by Its members." The
work has been that of awakening public interest in
the approaching primary elections and uniting and
organizing the various elements of the Republican
party for the campaign that is to come.
Concerning the importance of the immediate issue,
the resolutions declare:
Recognizing that the primary elections are in reality
the fundamental and important basis of every project
making for good government, it Is heartily to be hoped
that all good citizens of every party will do their utmost
toward calling out as large a vote as possible at the
ensuing primary elections, which are now, by force of a
beneficent law governing: primary elections, surrounded
by the same safeguards and securities against frauds
and violence as are regular elections. It is only by the
Epathy cf the gTeat body of good citizens that the ever
vigilant boss cliques may rule and ruin our city govern
ment. As the day fixed by law for the next primary
election, namely, August 13, 1901, has now on the petition
of the Republican Primary League been declared a legal
holiday, there is no Justifying reason for the failure of
any good citizen to do his share, large or small, in secur
ing a representative vote at said primary election.
No intelligent citizen will be inclined to deny any of
the propositions embodied in that statement. Primary
tlections are indeed the fundamental and important
basis of every project making for good government.
From them proceed lhe delegates who are to draw up
the platform of party pledges and nominate its candi
dates. Unless the delegates be animated by an earnest
desire for good government they will readily fall under
control of professional politicians, and boss domina
tion will result.
In times past the extent to which fraud was possible
at the primaries afforded some excuse for good men
in refusing to take part in them, but since the adoption
of the law assuring honest elections at the primaries
that excuse is no longer valid. Under existing condi
tions the bosses can triumph only when the better ele
ments of the party are apathetic If all genuine Repub
licans will register and go to the polls on election day
those pretending schemers who have acted as Repub
licans only for the sake of spoils will be defeated all
along the line!
It is to be borne in mind that the issues before the
people in the contest are not slight. As the resolu
tions of the advisory committee say: "The primary
election being held to select delegates to a convention
which will nominate a Mayor, Board of Supervisors
and all municipal officers is of prime importance to
every citizen who favors a strong, clean and sound
municipal administration."
The Primary League stands for no faction; nor is it
for or against any particular candidate. Its object is
to enlist public interest in the primaries and the elec
tion, and to organize the forces of the Republican
party for the establishment and maintenance of an
honest and efficient city government It is, therefore,
an organization which can rightly claim the support
of every genuine Republican. Its .work with respect"
to the primaries, however, is not for the party only
but for the whole community. All good citizens
should register and get ready "for the primary elec
tions, no matter to which party they belong. Under
the new law there is a chance for all parties to put
their best men in the field, and it is desirable they
ihould do so. Apathy at this juncture is a lack of civic
patriotism. ' 'Â¦"'...-:.':.Â¦;

SEARCHING FOR AN ISSUE.
HAVING wearied their brains in vain in search
ing for a Moses to lead them out of the Egyp
tian darkness in which they are wandering, the
Democratic organs and orators who find it necessary
to do something to keep themselves before the public
are now trying to find a new issue. They repeat to
one another with great unction the sententious wis
dom that the issue finds the man, and accordingly they
conclude that all they have to do is to either discover
an issue' or make one.
The recent declarations of certain Republicans in
Congress and out of it in, favor of tariff revision have
given great hopes to the issue hunters. Many of them
are eager now to start another free trade agitation.
The Washington Post has encouraged the new craze
greatly by saying:
We can conceive of no happier fortune for the some
what demoralized and disheartened Democracy than to
be endowed with the campaign thunder, the political
capital that will be in its hand if Congress adjourns
without having put away the flagrant abuses that are
sheltered behind some of the schedules of the tariff
Of 1897.
That statement has given high hopes to a number of
Southern Democrats who have never liked Bryan nor
free silver nor Populism. â¢ They believe they see in
the tariff a chance to win back the Federal offices for
which they yearn. They have come to the conclusion
that the Republican party can never' revise the tariff.
One of them says: "The strength of the trust in
trenchments behind the Republican guns forbids any
revision at Republican hands, such as will be satis
factory to the people." In \that hope some of the
seekers after new issues are content to rest. They
have begun to cry out for tariff reform, and are wait
ing to see what sort of a man that .issue will bring to
All Democratic papers, however, are. not enamored
of a tariff fight. A good many of them remember what
resulted from tariff tinkering before, and are not will
ing to try the experiment again. Some of that class
A NOTABLE extension and improvement has
been made in the reports issued by the local
weather bureau. . It consists in what is called a
"special daily fruit service" and contains reports from
various fruit centers giving the maximum and mini
mum temperature for the day, the direction of the
wind, the state of the weather and the amount of pre
cipitation, with additional information concerning the
progress of harvesting fruit. Thus a specimen report
of yesterday was: San Joseâ Maximum temperature,
7i; minimum, 55; direction of wind, northwest; state
of the weather, clear; precipitation, .00. An accom
panying note was to the effect: "Strong northwest
wind; picking apricots in the foothills; drying will be
gin in ten days."
These reports come from fruit centers generally and
thus give information from many points not included
in the regular weather .reports. Their' value will, of
course, be considerable, as they will enable dealers to
follow accurately the progress of fruit harvesting and
to know under what weather conditions the fruit is be
ing picked. They will also enable the fruit men of any
locality to know the conditions which .prevail else
where.
The extension of the service thus made might be
carried further so as to include reports of the supply
and demand for labor in the orchards of any particular
district. There are many persons looking for work
who might readily obtain it in the orchards and vine
yards if they kne,w exactly where to go. It may be
that there are insuperable objections to making that
addition to the reports that are now being obtained,
but, if so, it will be worth while for the officials of the
bureau to bear it in mind and consider whether they
may not -undertake it later on.
What has been done will be hailed with satisfaction
throughout the State. It is an important extension of
the service rendered to the public by the bureau, and
it is to be hoped it will not only be permanent but will
grow and expand with the years.
SPECIAL "WEATHER - REPORTS.
The deadlock among the powers on the Chinese In
demnity question may yet afford the high court of
nations. a chance to show that it holds the key.
That is a fact -which the Democratic seekers will
have to face. The chances are that when the election
year is at hand the objects of their search will still.be
undiscovered, and they will have to take the old plat
form and either the old leader or some man he may
name.
As for William Jennings Bryan, he will either be
nominated three years' hence by the Democratic Na
tional Convention or he will dictate the name of the
man who will be nominated. He ia young 1 enough to
run at seven different Presidential elections. I really
expect to seo him elected to the Presidency.
Of the accuracy of those statements there can be
no doubt. .Democracy stands for certain positive prin
ciples, and among them are free trade and free silver,
and Bryan intends to hold the party to the platform.
Whether he -can succeed or not may be doubtful, but
the Hon. Champ Clark of Missouri, who has been
.traveling extensively through the country, has recent
ly summed up the result. of his political observations
by saying:
The Democratic Â¦ party stands for definite, positive
pripciples, and unless I mistake the sentiments of the
masses the voters will insist upon adhering- to these
principles, in spite of the threats of reorganizes. Those
who argue from the standpoint of expediency will not
have influence with the voters, because no one can say
what is expedient. "We may deserve to win and yet
lose, but it still remains that to deserve to win Is the
surest road to success. â¢ -
While those various efforts to find a new issue and
a new man are going on Bryan watches the game
closely and occasionally reminds the seekers that they
must follow his rules. He- has recently said:
believe in waiting for an issue to come along and offer
itself instead of trying to make one by a forcing
process. ;

TEA TN TRANSIT MAY
NOT BE REPACKED
Treasury Ruling That "Will "Work
Hardship to Many Importers
in San Francisco.
The Secretary of the Treasury communi
cated yesterday to Customs Collector
Stratton the decision en the appeal of
Folger & Co. from the action of the Col
lector preventing the repacking of tea in
transit. The department upholds the or
der of the Collector.
Until recently It had been the practice
to allow merchants having tea in United
States bonded warehouses in transit for
Mexico and Central America to repack the
same in one pound and half pound pack
ages and replace them in the original pack
ages. Recently a special agent of the
treasury called the attention of the Col
lector to the fact that such repacking,
while not fraudulent, was in violation of
the regulations of the Treasury Depart
ment, and upon that representation the
Collector refused to grant any further
permits to repack teas.
As the prohibition worked much hard
ship to tea importers. Folger & Co. pre
pared a test case and the matter was pre
sented before the Secretary of the Treas
ury, who ruled against the tea importers.

BRITON'S FEAR
FOR THE NAVY
Sharp Criticism Disturbs
Ministers of the
Empire.
LONDON, July 3.â During the debate to
day In the House of Commons on naval
estimates the Cabinet Ministers were
heckled on all sides regarding the condi
tion of the navy. It was asserted that
the British Mediterranean fleet was inad
equate to meet the French and Russian
squadrons, that it was under-manned and
unequipped, especially with modern guns;
that It lacked colliers and that the coal
depots were all exposed to an enemy's
fire. The members generally predicted
that in case of war the Admiralty would
break down as completely as the War Of
fice did.
P. 0. Arnold -Forster, Secretary to the
Admiralty, in replying -referred to the
great demand on the Admiralty for ser
vices in South Africa and China, and
promised to strengthen the Mediterranean
fleet when new battleships were available
and to add to the fleet cruisers and tor
pedo boat destroyers.

In the Divorce Court.
Louisa A. Short Tvas granted a divorce
from Bert W. Short yesterday on the
ground of extreme cruelty. May Belle
Trachy has sued Philippe Trachy for a
divorce, alleging failure to provide as
cause of action. <
Decisions as follows have been promul
gated by- the Internal Revenue Commis
sioner:
Deeds and mortgages executed before
July 1, 1901, must be stamped at the rate
provided for in the old law, even though
the instruments are recorded on or after
July 1, 1901. It Is the date of execution,
usually the date of dellvery ( that deter
mines the taxability of an Instrument.
The date of recording is immaterial.
The new act reduces the tax on deeds
to $5 cents per $500 on the amount over
$2500, deeds where the value of the prop
erty or the consideration is not over $2500
being exempt.
A quitclaim, deed given merely to- cor
rect an error in a former deed and con
taining a recital showing the purpose of
its execution and stating that it is given
without valuable consideration is not tax
able. The same rule applies to a quit
claim deed given by a person who has no
title, provided the grantor receives " no
consideration for the deed.
No tax accrues on gift deeds, nor on
deeds from a husband to a third ' party
and from that party to the wife of the
first grantor, when such conveyances are
executed for the purpose of making a gift.
Partition deeds executed by and be
tween Joint tenants or tenants in com
mon, where no valuable . consideration,
passes, are not subject to tax.
No stamp taxes are required on deeds
to or by trustees executed without valu
able consideration.
Where real property is conveyed sub
ject to a mortgage, if the deed Itself con
tains an agreement that the grantee shall
assume the mortgage, thereby becoming
liable for a deficiency Judgment in case
of foreclosure, then the deed must be
stamped for the amount of the mortgage
in addition to the value of the equity of
redemption. If there is no agreement
making the grantee liable for payment of
the mortgage the deed Is to be stamped
at the value of the equity of redemption
alone. Â¦ However, where the - mortgagor
conveys to the mortgagee and part or all
of the consideration is the release of the
mortgage, or where the grantor pays
only a portion of the consideration in
money and gives a mortgage for the re
mainder of the purchase price, the deed
must be stamped for the full. value of the
property. Â¦ . .> .
A legacy to an adopted child Is "taxable
as to a stranger in blood, unless the
adopted* child happens to be related as
nephew or niece, etc. . ...
Bonds of brewers, cigar and tobacco
manufacturers and distillers delivered
after July 1. 1901. require no stamps.

NEW DECISIONS
ON WAR TAXES
Although many conflicting statements
were made as to the cause of the flre,
Captain Comstock of the Underwriters'
Fire Patrol is of the opinion that hot
ashes in a wooden barrel were the means
of starting the conflagration.
The rapid work of the Fire Department
prevented what might have been a holo
caust. In the early hours of the morn
ing, when the inmates of the houses were
sleeping soundly, the dread alarm of fire
was sounded. The old shanties burned
like tinder and only the heroic efforts of
Chief Sullivan and the men of the Fire
Department kept the flames within
bounds and permitted of the escape of
the occuDants. ':Â¦
The residents in the burning houses
were panic stricken and in the excite
ment of escaping many persons were re
ported to have lost their lives.
After the flames were quenched a care
ful investigation was made and the only
accident reported was that in which Mrs.
Antonia Taratini was fatally burned.
The unfortunate woman was unable to
leave her room at 3 Prescott place, being
a sufferer from paralysis. Her son-in
law, M. Garcia, first conveyed his wife
and child to a place of safety and then
returned for his Invalid mother-in-law.
The old lady was lying near the burning
walls of her room and almost every por
tion of her body was deeply burned. She
was hastily conveyed to the street by
Garcia and removed In a patrol wagon
to the Harbor Hospital. Her injuries
were attended to there and later in the
. ner of Vallejo street and Prescott
place, between Montgomery and Sansome
streets. Mrs. Antonia Taratini, an aged
widow, who resided at 3 Prescott place,
was terribly burned. She died last even
ing in the Emergency Hospital.

I>andruff. Is Eradicated.
Sealskin is admired the world over for
Its softness and glossiness; and yet the
human hair is equally as soft and glossy
when healthy; and the radical cause ot all
hair trouble is 'dandruff, which is caused
by a pestiferous parasite that saps the
vitality of the hair at Its root. Newbro's
Herpicide is the only preparation that Is
fatal to the dandruff germ. Without dan-
druff no falling: hair, but a luxuriant
growth of glossy, soft -hair is certain."
Scouring the scalp won't cure dandruff.
Kill the dandruff germ. Thousands of
women owe their -beautiful suits of hair,
to Newbro's Herpicide.

Increased no very extensive speculation in
Ftocks can be carried on without Incurring a
uringent money market. As soon at July dis
liurpenientE are made some relief will be afford
*d. smd there is no telling bow far the big
tei&tn of securities may be able and willing
to aid the money market. Large rams are Btlll
known to be locked up in syndicate operations,
mud the release of these amounts would be fa
vorable to ease in July and August. The seo
end consideration, the crisis in Germany, is
entitled to more weight than it receives. Ger
many is tuffering acutely from the consequences
cf overspeculation in industrials during.Xhe last
ivo or three years. Inflation was the order of
the day and reaction followed Inevitably. The
German bank failures show a very unsatisfac
tory condition of affaire, and it is by no means
certain that the end of theee disasters has yet

oonfidence are the greatest dangers at present.
General business Is eo satisfactory and. pros
perity eo general that it is hard to resist the
unusual temptations. The speculative spirit Is
thoroughly aroused and needs restraint, and
just such exjieriences as last week's, unpleas
ant as they may be. are ne<led to keep specula
tion within bounds. Fcr the present we advise
sÂ£ainÂ£t indiscriminate buying. The money mar

NEW YORK, July 3.â To-day's stock market
Â¦was little more than nominal. The volume of

have been attached to the fact. The subject

Monday next- When this was accomplished it
â¢was greeted Â¦vrith cheers all through the Wall

SteeL That etock reflected clearly enough the
disappointment of holders over the dividend, or
raiber over ihe wording cf the dividend decla
ration. The omission of the word quarterly in
conmction with the 1 per cent dividend on the
common stock was alleged to throw doubt on
the continuity of the dividend rate thus estal>
liEhed. The argument of the friends of the
stock tbat room was thus left to Increase tbe
rate ejs well as to decrease It did not assure
the speculators and they 6old the stock freely.
The preferred Buffered even more markedly, de

There was a general hope and expectation
among professional operators in stocks last
week that there would be some revival of
speculation this week, which has been total
ly disappointed- It is not' likely that quite
favorable developments would have proved in
adequate to overcome the repressive influence
on Etock ojjerations as on every other form of
human activity, owing to the terrible heat.
Business at the exchange was of such small
proportion that the price changes offer little
1 significance. There has been an undertone of
uneasiness as an outgrowth of the discussion
and criticism of the affairs of the Seventh Na
tional Bank and Marquand & Co., whose fail
ures were of moderate effect on the market last
week. The Burface of affairs, while quiet, has
reflected that a process was going on of the
ovet hauling of collateral in loans and tha
operation of credits lacked the perfect smooth
ness and facility which have characterized the
money market since recuperation was fairly
established after the May panic Certification
of checks for the large amounts employed by
stock exchange houses has-been less ready.
Conjecture regarding the character of collateral
for bank loans in seneral was stimulated by
this condition and also by the closing of two
banks in Buffalo, not in" themselves of import
ance. In the publio discussion which has been
going on the argument has been frankly ad
vanced that some of the methods of the failed
bank which have been most criticized and
which are admittedly in contravention of the
statutes are really essential to the conduct of
business in the Wall street district and are
entirely In common practice among New Tork
City banks. There has been as usual a bear
contingent of professional operators ready to
make use of all available means to force a re
action. They have had on their side the cur
rency reports In London reflecting on the se
curity of New Tork bank loans. The feeling
thus engendered has had the effect of re
pressing rather than depressing speculation.
The hot weather of the week has caused
anxiety regarding the crops, especially the corn
crop, and corn carrying railroads have natural
ly been specially affected. '. The inauguration
of a strike by the Amalgamated Association of
Â¦ Iron Steel and Tin Workers has given pause
to speculation based on the prosperous and
acti-ve condition of these trades. The real
scope of the subject is little understood.
The success of the semi-annual settlements
in Berlin has afforded relief to the money
markets of the whole world and money has
cheapened bo suddenly In London as to threat
en withdrawals of French capital invested
there, .but this ease of money is considered
transitory and the needs of the early autumn
are already considered both In London and
New Tork. "With a heavy wheat crop to move
large demands~\for money In the interior are
looked for, notwithstanding the present large
supply of interior capital. Part of this capi
tal has in fact been invested in the New Tork
money market while rates were Inactive, and
is subject to withdrawals to meet immediate
needs. Its deoline in Chicago exchange on
New York this week to twenty-five cents dis
count, compared with twenty-five cents pre
mium last week, is significant. The ability of
foreign markets to meet New-York's demand
on them for gold when the grain export move
ment grows is a factor in the money problem
of the future. It la not expected that the
Blow I liquidation in Germany has been com
pleted here and the shortage with -which her
grain crop .threatens continued depressions,
pointing to action of idle money in banking
centers.
Railroad bonds have been as much neglect
ed as stocks and. have moved narrowly.

CHICAGO, July 8.â "Wheat opened firm on
higher cables, due to further reports of French
crop damage. The market was heavj^and fluc
tuations were confined within a narrow range.
Most of the buying orders came from outsiders
and certain local shorts who were evening up
over the Fourth. Continued favorable accounts
of winter wheat harvest were the chief hin
drances to any pronounced bullishness. Sep
tember opened a shade to higher at 66V4
<g66%c.
â¢ The bulk of the trading was done around 66%
<f?66 ] ,ic and the close was %c higher at 66%@
C6%c.
The corn pit furnished the most Interest to
traders to-day, but the opening was somewhat
easier, due to prevalence of thunderstorms div
ing the past twenty-four hours. The situation
in Missouri and Kansas, however, where rain
was most needed, remains unchanged. Longs
were anxious to secure profits. September
ciosed %c lower at 46%c.
The early tendency in oats was toward a
lower level, mostly In sympathj* with corn. Un
favorable weather held the market firm. Sep
tember closed with a loss of V*c at 27%@27%c.
Provisions were dull with a general downward
tendency. The opening was lower on small re
ceipts of hogs and lower prices for the same.
There was some liquidation by outside longs
and also some selling for short account In a
moderate way. Trade was small and following
the rather sharp break at the opening there
were no violent changes in prices. Local pack
fers bought on the decline. September pork
closed SOc lower, lard 15c lower and ribs 20c.

The market for Apricots seems. t{> be improv
ing, and a scarcity of good canning stock isÂ«
becoming apparent. Large yellow Apricots are
even now scarce, but there is plenty of small
and scaly stock on the market. The canners
do not want white Apricot3, either large or
small. This fruit is coming in sunburned from

sioners decided yesterday that the sea
wall lots, now used as a repair yard by
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company,
shall be set apart for a railroad freight
terminus. The steamship company has
almost moved all its plant away and the

on the snace are to be connected with
the belt railroad and all the hauling and
switching is to be done by the State em
ployes. In moving the adoption of the
resolution. Commissioner Herold said the
needs of the port required extra facilities
for handling railroad freight and that the
space proposed to be set aside was the
most desirable now available. The other
members of the board agreed with him

Crashed Into the Wharf.
The tug Active ran into the Clay-street
bulkhead yesterday and did several hun
dred dollars' worth of damage. .There
was a misunderstanding of signals and
the engines were put "full speed ahead"
Instead of "full "speed astern," and then
the crash came. Two 12x12 stringers
v.erÂ« cut clean through and the planking
for a space of fifteen feet was torn up.
Colonel Tom Burgoyne was standing -with
liis hack to the steamer and when the
wharf began to rise under his feet he
got a scare that made his hair stand on
end. The clock In the chief wharfinger's
office stopped and Assistant Chief Wharf

building is coming down!" For a mo
ment he thought it was an earthquake
and feared for the ferry tower.

ALAMEDA. July 3.â The. proposition to
raise money for school improvements by
issuing bonds was the principal matter
for discussion before the Board of Edu
cation last night. It was decided that at
least $100,000 will be needed to carry out
the plans of the School Directors, and the
City Trustees will be asked to submit a
proposition for raising that amount to the
voters of the city.
For this amount the Board of Educa
tion expects to build a brick high school
building for $53,000, buy a site for It for
$10,000, add four rooms to the Wilson
School building for $8400. add eight roorn3
to the Mastick School building for $16 800
purchase a lot adjoining the Wilson
School building and pay $7800 for equip
ments.
It Is for the City Trustees to decide
finally whether they will submit the mat
ter to the people and it will be put into
their hands by the Board of Education
at their next meeting.

The Judge said all he desired was that
the witnesses testify in open court, and he
would instruct them all to be present to
morrow-morning. He asked Detective Mc-
Mahon to swear to a complaint on infor
mation and belief, but Captain Seymour
objected, as the firm had refused to pros
ecute. The captain, however, said that he
would nee that Collins was in court to
morrow. ~
ney. said the court had lost its jurisdic
tion when the case was dismissed Tues
day, and Collins could not again be
brought into court unless a new complaint
was sworn to.
Attorney Ach. who was engaged by
Charles S. Bier of Rinaldo Bros., from
whose warehouse Collins was accused of
stealing the cigars, said that Bier had no
right to swear to the complaint originally,
and he would not allow/him to swear to a
new one, as he would leave himself open
to prosecution for false arrest. There was.
in his opinion, absolutely no case against
Collins. The cigars were not marked and
could not be identified, and there was
nothing to show that those purchased by
E. Blrdsej', the saloon-keeper, were not
sold by the firm in the regular course of
business.

The case of Matthew Collins, special po

A late report says the amount secured
from the through safe was $50,000. The
express company has offered a reward of
$5000 for the arrest and conviction of the
robbers. .

and -was shot in the right arm, but not
seriously injured.
Conductor Smith notified all passengers
as fast as he could go through the train
to keep out of sight, which they did by
getting down in. the middle of the cars.
Dynamite was then applied to the ex
press car.
A sheepherder riding about a quarter of
a mile from where the express car was
blown up was fired upon by the robbers.
The bullet struck his saddle, but did not
Inflict any serious wound nor hinder his
horse from making a wild dash for lib
erty. The sheepherder reported the rob
bery at Wagner about 3:35 p. m., and a
posse of men from Malta, Mont., twelve
miles # from the scene of -the robbery,
and a posse of men from Glasgow, Mont.,
seventy miles east, were started within
fifteen minutes by special train. A special
train was also started from Havre with
doctors to attend the wounded.

Politicians out of a Job fc are very. much
interested in the outcome of an applica
tion made to the Treasury Department by
Customs Collector Stratton for the ser
vices of an additional Deputy Collector in
the Custom-house at this port to take
charge of the. Bureau of Navigation, now
handled by Deputy Collector Newton S.
Farley. The business of the port has in
creased so rapidly since the beginning of
the war with Spain that there is too much
work even for a deputy and a half, and
an additional : deputy for the Bureau of
Navigation is imperatively demanded.
The salary, of the position Is $3625 per
year. The plum will be large enough,
coupled with the permanency feature of
the civil . service, to attract a large, num
ber of prominent politicians. Among. the
possible candidates mentioned are Wil
liam B. Hamilton. John P. Jackson Jr.,
Senator Jack Tyrrell and Alva Watt.
A Fat Deputyship.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 3.
"Dorothy Studebaker, society -vaudeville
balladist," as Mrs. Scott McKeown is
known on the stage, returned from an
Eastern engagement to-day in response
to a' telegram' urgently requesting her
presence at the bedside of her mother,
who is critically ill at her home, 118
Twelfth street.
The story of the McKeowns running
through with the bride's $100,000 dowry
in Los Angeles before the end of their
honeymoon is still fresh in the public
mind, as is the young wife's debut at the
Orpheum last February, when want
stared them in the face.
In the brief Interval since that time
Dorothy Studebaker has become a recog
nized star in the vaudeville firmament and
has a number of lucrative offers for the
coming season.
. "My husband dosen/t like the idea of
my being on the stage," said the singer
to-day, "but It paysâ and we had to have
the money. I went alone; he said he
didn't want to be 'excess baggage.' I've
met lots of charming people and some not
bo nice; it's just like life elsewhere. The
audiences have been awfully good to me
and I've had nice press notices. I dread
to look at them, however, because people
tell the papers such ridiculous stones
about me.
"My work is very simple. I just go on
and sing two or three ballads and then
I'm at liberty.' It isn't hard. ;
"I used to be stage-struck,' but I'm not
any more. But I doubt whether I'll ever
leave the stage as long as I have my way.
I shall probably go. on in burlesque in â¢
New York next season."
Mrs. McKeown will return to the East
as soon as her mother's health permits. '

Revised Law.
OAKLAND. July 3.â The Oakland Tran
sit Company filed its new mortgage with
the County Recorder this afternoon. TnÂ©
face of the mortgage is $3,000,000, which
represents the bonded indebtedness-au
thorized to cover the entire system,' in
cluding all of the old lines of the Oakland
Transit Company and the San Pablo ave
nue and Telegraph avenue lines, which
have been added. The Transit Company
delayed filing this mortgage, though the
bond Issue was authorized several months
ago. until after the 1st of July, when thÂ©
new revenue law went Into effect. ThÂ©
new revenue law does not require rsvenue
stamps upon mortgages, and by waiting 1
until to-day the company saved $1500 In
revenue stampsâ quite a little Item when
this would have had to be raised by car
fares.
This mortgage will cover the balance
upon the purchase price of the San Pablo
and Telegraph avenue lines, which was
$1,500,000, with $100,000 paid down. The
balance, $1,400,000, will be Issued to the
public and sold to make improvements
and reconstruct most of thÂ© old lines of
the comnany.

Stare of Lifeless Eyes
Transfixes a Po
liceman.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, July 3.
_In the dim light of dawn this morning
Policeman Frank Lynch, while on his
beat, saw a woman's form in a sitting
posture at a window of the Newlands
House, northeast corner of Seventh and
Washington streets. A peculiar stare
about the face attracted the patrolman's
attention, and he became possessed of an
uncanny feeling.
Again he gazed at the figure, and again
he was moved to stop and scan still more
closely the form that had caught his pass
ins glance. .
He could not tell what impelled him to
go over to the lodging-house and arouse
the landlord. The policeman, after gain
ing admission went to the room, and fail-
Ing to get a response to his repeated
knocking, forced an entrance. His pre
monition that something was wrong was
verified. He found the occupant of the
chair at the window â¢ dead. Indeed, the
gaze that had been so unexplalnable to
the blue-coated patrolman was the stare
of death. The roomer was Mrs. Francis
Gleason, an aged housekeeper, formerly
employed at the Newlands House. Some
time last evening she had seated herself,
fully clad, in a chair, and while there
death had summoned her so quietly that
her body remained in a natural position.
The Coroner took charge of the case.
It is supposed that heart disease was the
cause of death. Little is known about the
woman. She had of late been manufac
turing a patent metal polish of ber own
invention. Roomers at the place said she
had a husband and a son. but none was
able to give a clew to their whereabouts.
Correction of Assessments.
Only thirteen applications have been
filed by property owners with the- Board
of Equalization in the- last two days for
correction of assessment. They are all for
small amounts except one filed by Alex
W. Wilson, who petitions that the assess
ment on a lot at the southwest corner of
Turk and Taylor streets be reduced from
$40,000 to $20,000, on the ground that the
improvements consist of an old â¢ frame
building remodeled. James R. Gamier
ask* that the assessment on his property
on Pine street, Â¦ between Hyde and Leav
enworth, be reduced from $12,940 to $8627.
The Park Congregational Church and the
Bethlehem Congregational Church want
the assessments on' mortgages on their
property, respectively on Hayes and on
Vermont streets, canceled, under the law
exempting church property from taxation.

NEW CALVARY PRESBYTE

APPEAR FINISHED.

The laying of the corner-stone will be per
formed by the Rev. Dr. Hemphill. Prom
inent clergymen of the various denomina
tions have been invited to be present and
Invitations have been accepted. A very
good attendance Is assured, as the Cal
vary Church congregation is large, and
the structure will be one of the finest on
the Pacific 'Coast.
On the other hand Grunsky has the
following note after his statistical sum
mary:
It is to be understood that the prices allowed
in the above appraisement for outside lands
and. water rights are made liberal, being in
tended to cover whatever allowance would
ordinarily be made for the fact that the busi
ness was an established one. The values put
upon lands in reservoirs now in service should
be considered as including also such expendi
tures as may have been necessary to clear the
site and prepare it for use. For reservoir and
other properties directly connected with the
service in the city, an addition of 25 per cent
is made as a reasonable allowance for value
due to this fact.
From Schussler's note it appears that
he considers the Spring Valley properties
to be worth. Including the assessed value
of the franchise, $45,631,750, or $20,933,950
more than Grunsky allows. *
In the complaint filed by Attorney Kel
logg the valuation Is not definitely made,
but the sum of $35,000,000 Is mentioned in
the following: >
Secondâ That 'plaintiff Is entitled to have rates
for supplying pure, fresh water to said city
and county and Its inhabitants for the fiscal
year commencing July 1, 1901, and ending June
30, 1902, bo fixed that they will In the ag-gregrate
afford a just and reasonable compensation for
the services rendered and will yield a sufficient ,
annual income to the plaintiff to pay its operat
ing expenses and taxes and to realize, in ad
dition, the rate of 7 per cent per annum upon
its property in actual use in 6O supplying said
city and county and its inhabitants, and that I
such value of said property is a sum largely In
excess of J35.000.000.
Eejections by City.
The large differences in valuations may
call for some explanation on the part of
the differing engineers.-
Grunsky reports that the statements of
the water company may be accepted for
the present as conclusive concerning the
capacity of the works. . He says that the
upper dam of the Pilarcitos reservoir
works, which is by the company enume
rated as among the properties of the
company now In use, having been sub
merged when the main lower dam was
built in 1668-69, should be considered as
having gone out of service. It will be
noticed that there is; a difference between
the two engineers of $400,000 in. estimating
the value of Pilarcitos.
Grunsky also refused to consider part
of the Lochs Creek line, above Aponollo
Creek, near San Andreas reservoir, and
the works above the creek as in service.
He claimed that the repair of the works
would practically mean reconstruction.
Pipe (thirty-Inch) displaced by forty-four
inch pipe at San Andreas; the dam of the
main or lower Crystal Springs reservoir,
the Lochs Creek aqueduct work, the old
works of the Alameda Creek system from
a stone dam about two and a half miles
above Nlles to a junction with the new j
thirty-six-inch pipe on the south side of
Alameda Creek, at Niles; the Searsville |
reservoir site, the Lobos Creek property
and the rights controlled by Spring Valley
on Pescadero Creek, are all either excluded
by Grunsky from valuation for purpose
of rate making or are considered to be re
duced In valuation.
Gransky [Discusses Point.
One of the points discussed at length la
the value of a franchise. Concerning this
Engineer Grunsky argues for the city
that*
It will suffice to say that no franchise has
any value beyond the capitalization of its net
earnings. When earnings can be determined
with fair precision the value of the franchise
is easily estimated. When earnings are un-

Franchises and Bonds.
Wlth~"his estimate Schussler has a foot
note Id which he says: "This total does
not include the assessed value of the
franchise, which is nearly $5,400,000. and
on which the Spring Valley Water Works
paid taxes last year amounting to about
$S7,000." He also says:
It has been considered by some of the muni
cipal authorities of Sari Francisco that the face
value of the stock -and bond issue of the Sprins
Valley Water Works should be taken as the
value of the works; but It must be remembered
that, even when these are at par in the pub
lic market, they represent only the public esti
mate of value, when and after they have been
assailed year after year by Incessant attacks
upon and reductions of the company's revenue
far below the Just income warranted by the
actual values of the properties acquired for
and employed in the public service.
From the careful and conservative estimates
above made of what ths plant in worth in
reality, it can readily be determined what
prices the stocks and bonds would bring In the
market if rates commensurate with the values
were allowed.
The public estimate, based on the present
premises, is neither a safe nor a just guide, nor
is the cost of the properties, which makes no
allowance for enhanced value from any cause.
Could it be assumed that if the actual value
had depreciated, say. 50 per cent below cost,
such members as may now favor cost as
the basis would" then favor it. If not, then
the rule Is radically wrong, for â¢ It will not
work both ways.
That the pretended bill or ordinance, the
water rate order, be declared null and void;
that rates shall be fixed at the rate of 7 per
cent per annum on its property in actual use In
supplying the city and inhabitants with water;
that the Supervisors shall be compelled to fix
the rates for the fiscal year and that they shall
be based on 7 per cent per annum on the value
ol the properties actually supplying' water with
operating expanses and taxes; that a perpetual
injunction shall lie against the enforcement of
the water order now in question and to re
strain the -bringing of any suit to enforce the
ordinance; that the court shall determine the
value of the company's property actually in
use and also what Is a reasonable and just
r.et income, and also what Is a reasonable
amount to allow for operating expenses and
taxes on the property and what is the legal
basis for determining such amount, and what
is a reasonable allowance for the depreciation
of the plant; that the court shall adjudge that
a judgment dated July 20. 1889, Is res adjudi
cata between the city and the company on the
value of the properties, the value being then
fixed at $25,000,000. and that the city and the
Supervisors be estopped from placing any lesser
value thereon.
There was a full public hearing; the deter
mination of. facts was based upon expert testi
mony and an allowance of reasonable interest
upon the real value of property actually in use
and supplying San Francisco with water. I
do not see how any court can go back of the
proceedings of the Supervisors, so safeguarded
have they been. I suppose that the water com
pany nas taken courage from the decision Of
an Oakland Judge in the Contra Costa Water
case, where he taxes the community with a 7
per cent charge on a fictitious valuation. Here
tofore Spring Valley has been satisfied with 5
per cent interest.
So the only real question before the court is
the proper valuation of "the company's prop
erty. As I said before, the valuation that haÂ«
been adopted by the board has been fortified
by the opinions and Judgment of the best en
gineers on the Pacific Coast. What more can
be said? ,
The Company's Wants! Â«
'Attorney Kellogg, for the Spring Valley
Water Company, said that there was no
doubt in his mind that tne proceedings of
the Supervisors were irregular and illegal,
and that the court would overturn the
water rate ordinance and direct that a
new water order should be made. - In the
complaint Attorney Kellogg asks:
The board gave a full hearing to Mr. Schuss
ler on the last day of Ifebruary. Schussler
concluded his testimony and stated that he had
concluded. He attempted to get into the com
mittee rooms afterward, but the testimony was
all in and that court was drafting its findings
and preparing its decision. All requirements of
the law were complied with.
On this appraisement we have allowed 5 -per
cent Interest. That is more than the company
pays on its average bonded Indebtednes and
floating debt and is enough for stockholders
representing the real value of the company's
property, so the board allowed 5 per cent in
terest and taxes and operating expenses.
The testimony and report furnished by them
to the Supervisors satisfied the Supervisors con
cerning the real value of the Spring Valley
property, which was fixed at $24,667,800. The
Supervisors deducted from this the value of
properties which are not used in supplying San
Francisco with water and upon which the com
pany is not entitled to receive interest from the
city. One of the items deducted was the build-
Ing in which the City of Paris store is. That
building pays for itself In rents. The abandoned
site of the Market street reservoir was de
ducted, but that produces' no revenue. In the
valuation by the Board of Works was a large
item for "good will." amounting to $1,400,000.
The -appraisement made was liberal and repre
sented a sum considerably In excess of the
amount of money actually invested. â¢ .
Point About Interest.
Mayor Phelan- made the following state
ments in an interview with a reporter for
The Call:
There were no irregularities in the proceed
ings in the Board of Supervisors attending tha
fixing of the water rates. This was the first
time that the Supervisors had means to ascer
tain for themselves the real value of the
Spring Valley Water Works, and they appro
priated money to find out. The Board of
Works and the City Engineer were requested
to make the proper examination and they com
plied. They include perhaps the ablest and
most experienced civil engineer on the Paclne
Coast, Colonel Mendell. Marsden Manson and
Mr. Grunsky.
Mayor Phelan's Views.
In estimating the income the Spring Val
ley Company should receive there is an
open difference of 2 per cent per annum,
irrespective of valuation. The water rate
ordinance was based on a 5 per cent per
annum rate on the valuation adopted by
the Water Rate Committee and by the Su
pervisors. The Spring Valley, according
to Attorney Kellogg, wishes 7 per cent on
its own valuation. This is another of
the radical disagreements.
Perhaps all that is needed to complete
a fair general statement of the diver
gence in view of the opposing parties. to
the litigation is to furnish an interview
with Mayor Phelan, which is appended,
and the summary of wants presented in
the Spring Valley complaint.
certain the determining value of"#. franchise
is much more difficult. When, as in the case of
the Spring Valley Water Works, rates are fixed
by the consumers, the creation or destruction
of the franchise value lies in the hands of the
municipal authorities. The franchise in this
case is moreover not definable in terms of a
specific agreement with this city. Whatever
there may be of value in it is due to the fact
tfiat the business of the company is an estab
lished one. It is, therefore, to be considered
as included in the valuation of lands and water
rights in so far as it appertains to works out
side of the city. That portion of it due to the
fact that the city distributing system is es
tablished and in operation is at least equivalent
to the expense which would now have to be
incurred to connect all services with a new
system of street mains.
HE suit of the Spring Valley Wat-
I er Works against the city and
I county of San Francisco, the
iL Board of Supervisors and the
members of the board individual
ly to overthrow- the water rate ordinance
for the current year Involves such a rad
ical difference between the municipality
and the water corporation that the in
volved facts are possessed of much public
Interest.
On one side the city and county con
tends that the income to which the water 'â¢
company is entitled is $1,689,986. including'
$425,000 for operating expenses and $196,000
for taxes. The corporation, on the other
hand, contends that it is entitled to 7 per
cent interest on $35,000,000, which amounts
to $2,450,000. Thus there is a difference,
excluding operating expenses and taxes,
of at least $700,000 in the two estimates.
The city's estimate is taken from the re
port of the Committee on Water, which
was the basis of the action of the Super
visors. The water company's figures are
contained in the complaint drawn by M.
B. Kellogg; attorney for the company, in
the pending suit. Â«
The city and county and the water
company will soon begin to discuss tha
fundamental facts before Judge Seawall.
Whatever value Â¦ may be attached to the
points raised by the attorney for the wat
er company concerning the legality of the
acts of the Supervisors while the water
rate ordinance was up for passage and
the counter contention by the city, the
public will be most concerned by the tes
timony promised concerning the valuation
of*the Spring Valley properties, which has
been the subject for debate annually for
many years.
The Valuations Differ.
The Board of Public Works instructed
City Engineer Grunsky to appraise the
Spring Valley properties. The City Engi
neer's conclusion was that the total value
is $24,667,800. The Board of Public Works,
in a communication to the Board of Su
pervisors, adopted the conclusions of
Orunsky and held that "this conclusion
indicates that the properties of the Spring
Valley Water Works now in use outside
of the city have value in excess of cost,
namely, franchise and water right val
ues." The Committee on Water Rates of
the Board of Supervir-'-s deducted from
the value fixed by Grunsky the sum of
Jl, 975,078. The deduction was "upon prop
erty not actually in use for the water sup
ply." The items enumerated by the com
mittee to make up this total are: City
property, $1,056,718; Searsville property,
$471,730; Calaveras property. $631,360; value
of franchise. $50,000.
Hermann Schussler, chief engineer of
the Spring Valley Water Works, prepared
several pamphlets while the fixing of the
water rates for the year were under con
sideration by the Supervisors. In one of
these pamphlets Schussler estimated the
value of Spring Valley properties. He
maue the total $40,231,750, the difference
being $15,563,950 as compared with Grun
sky's total.
Bases of Estimates.
There being such wide divergence in the
vk-ws of the engineers, Grunsky and

THREE OUTLJLWSJIOLp UP A TRAIN
Manager Kruttschnitt. in speaking
about the new order, said there were a
number of reasons why the saloons should
be done away Â¦with. One is that the
Southern Pacific does not have to be in
the liquor business, and another that the
room occupied by the saloons is valuable
space and should be used to afford more
comfort to travelers.-
.William McCormick has owned the bar
privileges on the Oakland boats for many
years. It Is said that he has amassed a.
fortune by selling cocktails and beer to
the weary travelers. He received a no
tice yesterday that his contract would be
canceled. H. P. Flannery, who also holds
contracts, will . have to retire from busi
ness. . :
Manager Kruttschnitt said to-day that
the train news agents would not be in
terfered with at present, because the
Denison News Company, handling that
service,' has a long-term contract with
the company. All saloon contracts, con
tain a "thirty-day". or a "ten-day" notice
to terminate clause. â¢â¢â¢ 'â¢
The decision to abolish the saloons
means an estimated loss of revenue to
the company of J30,000 a year. Most of
the bars have paid under their contracts
about $10 a day for the privilege. All of
the ferry-boats on the broad and narrow
gauge routes between Oakland and San
Francisco have bars, including the Oak
land harbor steamers. The river boats
are also thus equipped.
From railroad headquarters in San
Francisco the responsibility for this or
der is placed upon President Charles M.
Hays himself. During a recent trip across
the bay on the Berkeley he discovered
that a bar was conducted on that vessel.
He immediately made inquiry and then
declared that the saloons must go. The
move is in line with Manager Krutt
schnitt's abolition of liquor selling on the
trains of the company. It was explained
to-day that 'the ferry-boats operated by
the company in the Kast are not equipped
with bars, and that President Hays de
cided they could as well be dispensed with
at this end of the system.
The, commuter from dry Berkeley has
cultivated the habit of taking his morn
ing bracer on the ferry-boat and the
thirsty ones from the neighboring burgs
of Oakland and Alameda have contrib
uted largely to swell the profits of the
dispensers of the joyful glass. Indeed, so
important had this business become that
when the Southern Pacific built its new
Berkeley it made special reservation be
low decks for the accommodation of the
commuters who take a drop on the cross
bay journey. Then the other ferry-boats
were remodeled on the same lines. But
the bay tourist will have to find a new
source of supply. The company has not
only flatly and firmly ordered the saloons
out- but it has officially declired that it
will be the policy of- the company In the
future not to permit the selling of liquor
on any ferry-boats controlled , or owned
by the Southern Pacific Company. It Is
said that depot saloons will also be abol
ished. â¢
This is a drastic move on the part of
the railroad . company, for these saloons
have been conducted on the bay ferry
steamers ever since the system was
opened. For nearly thirty years the trav
eling public that had a thirst to quench
on the trip between Oakland and San
Francisco has had the means at hand.
The proprietors of the bars on the
cross-bay ferry-boats, the Sacramento
River boats, the Carquinez Straits trans
fer boat Solano and the Southern Cali
fornia ferries between Los Angeles and
Catallna Island have been notified that
they must get out of business before Au
gust 1. Some of the floating liquor dis
pensaries will be boarded up by July 10,
as the contracts with the company in a
number of instances _-. only require . ten
days' notice, and the company, through
General Manager Julius Kruttschnitt,
dated the summons July 1.
OAKLAND, July 3.-The Southern Pa
ciflc Company has put. its corporate foot
down' upon the saloon bars that for years
have been permitted to operate upon the
ferry-boats owned by that railway sys
tem. Before August 1 every bar on every

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 4, 1901;
of Worship That Will Be Oiie of the Finest Structures for
Use of the Presbyterian Denomination Upon the Coast
Impressive Ceremonies Are to Mark Formal Beginning of House
CONGREGATION IS READY TO LAY
CALVARY CHURCH'S CORNERSTONE

great legal battle is about to take place in the courts and the outcome is of much importance.

A person can pass through weather that
may be intensely hot Jn a comfortable
manner if the food be properly selected,
and the above suggestions can be put into
practice with most excellent results.
We phould follow this hint of nature,
end particularly in hot weather should
ovoid much butter, meat or any of that
class of food. Perhaps a little meat once
a day Js not amiss, even In hot weather,
but the breakfast end luncheon should be
made of fruit, one or two slices of entire
â¢wheat bread and some Grape-Nuts and
cream. Grape-Nuts are mentioned be-
cause they furnish the ideal cereal food
In a most palatable and delicious form,
In addition to which they are ready
cooked and require no attention whatever
from the cook.
Temperature Increased or Seduced
by Food.
The old army ration for the tropicE has
been very sharply criticised for the rea-
son that It consists of articles of food that
any person even s-lightly acquainted with
the elements of food knows is not adapt-
td to the needs of the human system In
hot weather. Nature shows forth in the
folection of food by inhabitants of vari-
ous countries: for instance, the Esqui-
maux in a cold climate selects heavy, car-
bonaceous foods, tallow, bacon and such;
while the Hindoo and Inhabitants of hot
countries turn to the cereals for susten-
ance.

The cTiarge preferred against A. J. Mar

The testimony showed that Martin, who

The â¢ safe door was unlocked as usual

Reports of "Widespread Ob
jection to Removal of
: Troops.
MANILA, July 3.â Congressman Hull of
Iowa, who accompanied General Chaff ee
on his southern tour, characterizes the
newly established provincial government
as "hothouse plants, unable to withstand
adversities." He said to a correspondent
that there will be many difficulties under
the ; dual civil and military government
which will be inaugurated to-morrow.
Hull believes that their natural richness
Insures tho eventual prosperity of the Isl
ands, but he is convinced from conversa
tion with. the Governors and army officers
that in the new southern province poverty
and other obstacles will prevent the suc
cessful collection of land taxes.' He be
lieves that the salarjes, excepting those
of the clerks and minor employes, are too
high from the Commissioners downward,
and "that the provinces ought to have far
larger areas and fewer officers. The
United States Commissioners agree with
this, but have deferred to the wishes of
the inhabitants. Â¦ .
Hull approves of the provincial laws,
but is of the opinion that the bulk of the
territory should be under military gov
ernment until absolutely pacified and
cleared of ladrones. He is convinced the
natives in general are not concerned
about the government. These views are
typically those of the generality of army
officers. The American civilians,, as a
rule, are not Inclined to await a fair trial
of the experiment of partial self-govern
ment and neither the natives â¢ nor the
army officers are in favor of any removal
of troops. :
General Sumner urges that the native
police of Tayabas province ought to.be
disarmed or. controlled by the. Military
Governor. Colonel Gardiner of the prov
ince insists upon controlling the police.
The pending bill for the organization of
the entire insular police provides for civil
control of the police, and army officers
predict clashes unless the military control
the police in the -disturbed localities.

Fight for High-School Principalship.
OAKLAND, July. 3.â The postponement
of the election of a T principal for the Oak
land High School has caused' every one of
the candidates to become more active.. J.
Fred Smith of Campbell, Santa Clara
County, had the necessary votes to elect,
but now he is confronted by more active
work on the part of the friends of the
other candidates. Pond of Sacramento
has developed some influential friends
who are aiding Vim, and S. P. Meads,, the
present vice principal, has a host of work
ers who are in favor of an Oakland man.
The State University at Berkeley is de
sirous of having It known that it is

contest. Smith. Meads and Pond have
been Indorsed as to their competency, but
no one man against the others.

Miss Ethel V. Hill died early this morn

case may call for a Coroner's inquest.

2 -o'clock : in . an unconscious condi
tion in the doorway of 27 Bartlett alley,

later. Pinned to his vest was a badge of

Policemen Hackett and' Ca'yott were at-~
tracted to the spot by a police whistle.
They found Harry Tremble, a boy living
at Montgomery avenue and Vallejo street,
bending over Dolan,' and William A. Mas
sey, 311 Grant avenue, standing beside the
boy.~ | Massey said j he thought some one
had struck Dolan on the head. ' The of
ficers found'a slight abrasion on the back
of the head. . - * .,.
From:Massey's statement Captain Sey
mour thought that Dolan might have been
foully dealt'. with, and he detailed Detec

Tremble and Masseyto police headquar

they did not know anything. Â¦ They saw
the man lying in the doorway, and some

he did not recollect saying that some one

Â¦ The -police came to. the conclusion that
Dolan had been in the. house and on com
ing out missed a step and fell. Dr. Gian

by a fracture of the opclpital bone, but
as there was no laceration of. the scalp,
which; would .be produced by a weapon,
he thought the. fracture might have been
caused by a fall. ,\

City May Not Sell Fran
chise to Highest
Bidder.
Attorney Gartland of the Board of
Works states that in the application of
the Standard Company for a permit it did
not specify what kind of fluid It vwas in
tended to supply. If a new application is
filed stating that the company, desires to
furnish electricity for illuminating pur
poses only the permit will be granted un
der the City Attorney's opinion.
On the other hand. If the Standard Company
Is. an electric lighting company, whose busi
ness it is to furnish electric light, and which
wishes to enter into competition with existing
electric lighting companies In the furnishing
of light to the people of San Francisco, there
Is no necessity for a franchise from the muni
cipality. It Is given the privilege of entering
the city, and using the streets : by the consti
tution itself. -
It ia not to be understood that the Board
of Supervisors may not limit by reasonable
regulation the use of the streets by, electric
light companies. This city has already de
termined that within the fire limits all elec
tric light wires shall be underground, and it
could Htill further extend this district, I have
no doubt. It can regulate the number, of poles
that may be erected Â¦ by any company in â¢ a
block and the height and character of such
poles.
City Attorney Lane Informed the Board
of Works yesterday that It has the power
to grant the petition 'of the Standard
Electric Distributing Company, of which
Prince Poniatowskl is president, for the
erection of poles outside of the fire limits.
In his opinion Lane declares that the
charter conflicts with the State constitu
tion as to the granting of franchises for
furnishing electric light in San Francisco.
He says the provision" of the charter re
quiring competitive bidding and payment
of a percentage of the gross receipts in
granting franchises. to lighting companies
is unconstitutional. The opinion says:
It does not . follow that . the Â¦ charter is un
constitutional as to power companies. ' On the
contrary, assuming, this matter of regulating
the granting, cf- franchises -to vbe'one properly
within the"purview of a~ municipality charter, .
I am of the opinion that the provision of the
charter , above quoted Is thp - law which ' gov
erns the granting of a. franchise to an electric
power ' company. It would therefore.be beyond
the oower of the Board of Public Works to
grant a permit for the erection of poles upon
the streets used by an electric power company
in the absence of a frajxAIse granted by the
Board of Supervisors In the manner laid down
by the charter. Â¦ Â¦

A testimonial concert was tendered last
evening to the Dominican Sisters 'by the
residents of the Sacred Heart parish on
the occasion of the sisters retiring from
the parochial, School, where they have
taught for the last eight years.' ' ; /-
The concert was given at Native Sons',
Hall, and the large attendance testified to
the appreciation, by the parishioners of
th e_untirlng work of the sisters. ' .

charge of the education of the children. .
Father Lagan, who is in charge of the
parsh, stated after, the -concert that the
Pfifh -school had been closed as the
building was -unsuitable for school pur
poses. It .was learned that the parishion
ers had purchased 1 the old Sutro resi
dence, corner of Fillmore and Hayes

parochial school there/but that the build
ing was again on the market. :â¢Â«
Many of- the ladies of - the i parish ex-*
pressed deep regret last, evening at. the
departure of tire Dominican Sisters, and
declared that a fund of ?40,000'Would be
raised to erect a school if the sisters
would be given charge of. it. The sisters,

SCHOOL CLOSING
CAUSES REGRET
ALTHOUGH it was a day ahead,
the air yesterday, and particu
larly last evening, reeked of
powder smoke and was filled
with the noise of bursting bombs
and firecrackers. Those who could not
wait were responsible for the preliminary
racket, but to-day every one will turn
loose and revel in all the noise a cltyful
can make when It tries.
The preparations for the Fourth of July
have made less stir this year than in the
past. The recent visit of the President
gave the city a premature jollification,
and the people have not quite got over it;
still the day will present all the attrac

fers, and thererneed not be any looking In
vain for patriotism or for personal pleas

There will be a parade, for the Fourth
without a parade would be like a chil

of military bodies and will not be long,

The demand of the jobbing butchers that
the union cards displayed in restaurants
be taken down by 3 o'clock last Tuesday
afternoon, under penalty of a refusal on
the part of the jobbers to supply meat,
met with a general response. While in
a f,ew instances the restaurant men kept
up their cards, the majority of the 130
who had them at the time they were noti
fled returned them during the day. Some
of those who held out had laid in a sup
ply of meat for several days. In dis
tricts where union feeling runs strong the
cards were persistently retained.
Dr. Chalmers reported to the Health
Board yesterday that Market Inspectors
Jonltn* and McEnroe had quanantined
thirty head of slaughtered cattle, 104 sheep
and thirty hogs, brought here from Port
land, Or.,* by Charles Weiby in response to
an order from Chris Merchant, a Sixth
street butcher. Welby says that Mer
chant came to him ten days ago with the
story that the wholesalers had refused
him meat because he is a union butcher.
Welby agreed to get a carload of meat for
Mei chant from the Zimmerman firm In
Portland. When the meat arrived Mer
chant refused to accept the consignment,
claiming that he had no money. A large
portion of the meat was condemned and
Welby figures that he has lost several
hundred dollars. Welby believes that the
Â¦wholesalers, angered at the importation .of
meat from Portland, induced Merchant to
refuse it 'Â¦Â¦
At the meeting last night of the execu
tive committee of the San Francisco La
bor Council it was decided to thoroughly
investigate the conditions surrounding
the controversy between the jobbing
butchers and the restaurant keepers. An
effort will be made to find out how many
union cards have been returned. What
is called an "unfair notice" will be issued
against such butchers as refuse to furnish
meat to restaurants displaying the union
card and who are most active in fighting
for the removal of the cards.
A delegation from the executive com
mittee visited several retail butchers dur
ing the afternoon, but no definite informa
tion was received, according to Secre
tary Rosenberg, except over the telephone
from one of the proprietors of the Mont
gomery Market, who responded that he
was ready to sell meat to any one who
had the money to pay for it, whether he
conducted a union restaurant or not. Ow

ACTIVE INQUIRY
There is a shortage of $30,000 In the
United States Branch Mint in this city.
A thorough Investigation has been made
by Superintendent Leach and his chief
deputies, but up to this time no trace of
the missing money has been found. The
genral supposition is that the coin was
abstracted from the vaults by employes,
though the chief clerk holds the shortage
Is due to an error in bookkeeping.
The shortage was discovered last Fri
day by George E. Roberts, Director Gen
eral of the Mint, who, with three assist
ants, was sent out here from Washington
to make an annual inspection of the books
of the local institution. June 30 Is the last
day of the fiscal year and these agents
are expected to make a -searching Investi
gation into the affairs of the Mint with a
view toward finding discrepancies, if
there be any. In counting the money in
the vaults it was discovered that six bags
of gold, value'd at $5000 each, were missing.
Believing that a mistake had been made
in counting, the experts repeated their
task, with the same result.
Dimmick Says There Is an Error.
The news' of the shortage spread
throughout the Mint very rapidly and all
the employes were. sworn to secrecy. It
was thought that the discrepancy would
be traced to the bookkeeping department,
but it was found that the books tallied
with the reports of the various depart
ments.
Chief Clerk Dimmick was of the opin
ion that there was no shortage. He still
believes that the money is all accounted
for and that an error in bookkeeping has
brought about the trouble. If it is found
that $30,000 has been taken from the Mint,
Mr. Dimmick may be held, in a way, re
sponsible for the loss. It is understood
that it is his- duty to count the money in
the trays and in the vault at the close
of each, day and report his result to the
superintendent.
According to one of the employes of the
Mint, this .money could easily be ab
stracted from the vaults by a person who
had access to them. A sack of gold con
taining $5000 weighs about twenty-two and
a half pounds, and is no larger than an
ordinary sack of salt. This might be car
ried out under an overcoat and not missed
by reason of hundreds of similar sacks
being in the vaults.
Coin May Have Been Stolen.
Frank A. Leach, superintendent of the
Mint, said of the shortage when seen In
Oakland: "This is very mortifying to us
all. The inspectors had Just pronounced
our record for this year the best made by
any Mint in the history of the country.
"The allowable waste on this year's
coinage would have been about $157,000.
The actual waste was $3709. Now this dis
covery has cast a cloud over the year's
work.
"We discovered the shortage, six bags
'of gold, coin containing $5000 each, last
Saturday. Since then we have been work-
Ing on the theory that a mistake in mak
ing up accounts had occurred. We have
run down every conceivable clew of this
kind with no result,- and seem forced to
the conclusion that the coin has been
stolen. The shortage was discovered in
the secretary's, or 'working' vault. Its
contents were the last to be counted. All
the bullion weighed in correctly and the
coin in all the other vaults, amounting to
$85,000,000, checked up all right. There was
$25,000,000 in the secretary's -vault. It is
supposed to hold only $6,000,000 when full,
but we have been so overcrowded, owing
to the Â¦ fact that the Sub-Treasury could
not take our -surplusage off our hands,
that the vault was piled full.
Impossible to Count at Glance.
"Owing to this fact it was impossible
to count the money at a glance, as Is the
case when the bags of gold are pigeon
holed, as is usually the case. For that
reason the loss of six bags might easily
pass unnoticed.
"But how that amount of coin could be
carried from the vault and then from the
building Is a mystery. There are three
ways in which it is remotely possible that
this, occurred. In the first place a mis
takemight have been made in paying out
some large sum. We sometimes make
single payments of a million dollars. It
seems hardly credible, however, with tho
checking and rechecking habitual in mak
ing these payments that an error of any
kind could have crept in.
"Then a few months ago the secretary's
vault became so full that its entire con
tents .were transferred to another vault.
The transfer was performed by our most
trusted men and a rigid tally was. kept
on every sack handled. I cannot see how
the money could have been taken at that
time.
Vault Constantly Watched.
! "The third possibility is, of course, that
some one went to the vault and took the
money. This again seems hardly rational.
Six bags of gold containing $5000 each is
a big, bulky load for any one to carry.
The vault is kept closed and under con
stant surveillance, and I donoUsee how
that amount in actual coin could have
been taken. While called the secretary's
vault, this is really the working vault, out
of which payments are made. There is
absolutely no clew and no suspicion, for
only the most j trusted and responsible
men connected with the Mint have access
to this vault."
>' There is at the present time more gold
in the Mint than at any other time In its
history. There is $60,000,000 in gold coin
stored In the two big vaults. The money
is in sacks of $5000 each. This vast sum
has accumulated during the last year by
reason of the heavy shipments of gold
from the Seattle assay office. The Alas

HOSPITAL RULE
IMPERILS LIFE
Patients in Emergency
.Cases Must Wait for
Dr. Bunnell.
Coroner Leland held an Inquest yester
day upon the body of George Price, the
colored soldier, who died July 1 from a
wound received by the discharge of a
pistol In the hands of Fred Bonnetti, a
clerk in Hirsch's store on Montgom
ery avenue. Price went into the store
with a\ fellow soldier to buy a revolver
of the same pattern as that of his friend.
The other soldier took a revolver out of
his hip pocket and handed it to Bonnetti
for examination. Bonnetti, forgetting
that men carry pistols usually loaded,
pulled the trigger and the bullet entered
the abdomen of Price and inflicted a
wound from which Price died.
Price was taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital and was allowed to lie
for three-quarters of an hour bleeding in
ternally until I>r. Bunnell arrived to per
form the operation of laparotomy. There
is a standing rule at the Central Emer
gency Hospital that all capital operations
must be performed by the surgeon in
charge, who in this case was Dr. Bunnell.
The doctor was not at the hospital when
Price was brought there, and the man
wounded in the intestines was obliged to
wait, for three-cuarters of an hour be
cause of a rule that assumes the incom
petency of the surgeons except Dr. Bun
nell to perform capital operations.
The jury ueturned a verdict of acciden
tal death and exonerated Bonnetti from
all blame.
Gardelli Pronounced Insane.
Francisco Gardelll, the male companior
of Julia Gonzaliski, a thieving domestic
whose case Is now pending- before Judge
Cook, -was taken to the Stockton Insane
asylum yesterday by a deputy sheriff.
Gardelll while confined in the County Jail
became suddenly Insane and destroyed the
furnishings of his cell.
