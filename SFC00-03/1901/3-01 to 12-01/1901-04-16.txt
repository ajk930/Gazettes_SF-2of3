"The next six weeks," says he, "will sse
a resumption of active campaigning. Lord

troops, including 60,000 mounted men. with

secured in Cape Colony alone. The army
is in gcod spirits and Lord Kitchener -is

ing dispatch from Lord Kitchener, dated
Pretoria, April 15:
"Colonel Sir Henry Rawlinson's column

SENATOR CLARK
IS NOT ENGAGED
The Pontiff then spoke of the position
of the Pope, which, he said, was most
shamefuj and disagreeable.
Alluding to the divorce bill drawn up by
a Socialist Deputy of the Italian Cham
ber, the Pope said:
"To the ancient -insults leveled at the
church it is desired to add another, pro
faning the sanctity of Christian marriage
and destroying the bases of domestic so
ciety.
Â¦ The Pope deplpred the seriousness of the
present times and foresaw a still graver
outlook in the future. He urged society
to have recourse to the light of God, and
concluded by announcing the appointment
of the new Cardinals, as already cabled,
of whom Mgr. Delia Volpe and Mgr. San
.Miniatelli are reserved in petto.
Russian Bishops of Mohilbw and Luzk
were appointed. 'X :'Â¦ \*'-

dinal and receiving his Insignia of office
from the special envoy which will come
from Rome to the cathedral at Baltimore
for the purpose of giving It to him, the
present delegate will remain in this coun-
ROME. April 15.â At the consistory
held to-day Archbishop Marti
nelli, the papal delegate to the

dinals were created as follows: Mgr. Fri
petl. Mgr. Cavagr.is, Mgr. San Mlnlatelli.
Mgr. Ceunarl. Mgr. Delia Volpe, the Arch
bishop of Benevento, the Archbishop of
Ferrari, the Archbishop of Prague, the
Archbishop of Cracow, the Bishop of Ve
rona and the Bishop of Pavla.
The consistory to-day was secret. A
public consistory will be held April 18.
Sod and Dangerous Events.
The Pope, in his allocution, said sad
and dangerous events have come to pass
and were becoming more serious and
spreading from one part of Europe to an
other. Several states, widely "separated,
but united by an identical desire, had en
tered into open war against religion. The
campaign was directed against the reli
erious congregations In order to destroy,
them gradually. Neither common law,
nor equity nor the deserts of the congre-'
gatlons have prevailed to prevent their
destruction. The desire was also mani
fested to prevent the y.outh from being
educated by the congregations, of whom
many pupils had become illustrious. .

WITH AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
try for a few months in order to get thi
business of the delegation in shape t<
turn over to, his successor.
Several names have been mentioned by
rumor as being those of men who were
likely to succeed Martinelli In the position
of representative of the Pope to this
country and It was at one time quite gen
erally believed that Mgr. Falconio, the
Apostolic Delegate to Canada, would be
transferred to Washington and given
jurisdiction over both the United States
and Canada. A little: thought will show
the extreme Improbability of any such
action. Canada and the United States are.
under entirely different governments and
their individual interests are often con
flicting. It has never been the custom of
the Holy See to send the same delegate
to two different countries, because of the
difficulty of reconciling clashing interests
and differences in ecclesiastical laws. .'
Those in Rome who are best posted as
to the plans obtaining in the Vatican are
now agreed that Mgr. Mery del Val, now
the president of the Pontifical Academy
of Nobles, will be sent to this country by
the Pope to succeed Mgr". Martinelli. Mgr.
del Val occupies the same position as did
Mgr. Satolll when he was sent as dele
gate to Washington, and he is a great fa
vorite with Leo XII, who has for some
years shown him every evidence i of
friendship and has allowed him to occupy
apartments in the Vatican. Mgr. del Val
is yet a young man, not over 35 years of
age, and Is a Â¦ descendant from one of
Spain's noblest families. His mother was
an English woman and he was "born in
England, receiving his early education
from. Â£he Jesuit Fathers In Stonyhurst Col
lege. His higher education, was received
in the Academy of Nobles in Rome, the
institution of which he is now president.
FEDERAL Quarantine Officer Dr.
John J.'Kinyoun has been trans
ferred to St.- Paul, Minnesota,
and Dr. .', Carm!chael. Federal
Quarantine Officer at Honolulu,
has been appointed his successor at this
port. The change will take effect on
May 1.
There is no doubt , that the action of
the United States Surseor.-General of the
Marine Hospital Corps in making the
transfer' has been In response to the
unanimous demand of the commercial or
ganizations of San Francisco, voiced
through California's Congressional dele
gation.
Dr. Kinyoun was the worst enemy the
State had ever had. His circulation of
bubonic plague reports inflicted incal
culable injury upon the State in general,
and San Francisco In particular. The
salient fact that the number of deaths in
the Chinese quarter, during the past
twelve months, with Dr." Kinvoun's bu
bonic nightmare thrown in, was no great
er than for any one of the preceding
years, could not star the damage
done by Kinyoun' s sensational declara
tions.
Added to his medical record he was
personally discourteous to the point of
rudeness, and he leaves this port the
most unpopular man in the State. No
tears will be shed over his going; no
hopes will be expressed for his . return.
His transfer has been made in acknowl
edgment of a great mass of protests sent
by business-' men from all parts, of the
State.
The removal of Dr.' Kinvoun came as a
genuine surprise to that official. He had
defied public opinion and entrenched him
self behind the dignity that doth hedge
in a medical official: No preparations for
departure had been made by. him: on
the contrary, all his preparations had been.
In the line of a nrotracted stav. In fact
he looked upon his retention here as a
victory for himself aga'nst the outraged
and insulted community, and it is said
that when yesterday morning he. open

"Washington ordering his 'transfer he
was so thunderstruck that he lost the
power of' speech '/for several seconds.
Later in the day after ho had pulled h"m
self together he Informed his medical
associates of the order which he had re
ceived from Washington lidding this com
munity of his presence.

while they were substantially correct in
their evidence they had misunderstood

Oii direct examination Ripley stated
that he had been talking with the boys

about getting up a company of cavalry.
'He came to Frankfort first on January 16,

IBVIHG AND MISS TEBRY
"From an abstract point of view every
American would naturally want the
United States to fortify and .absolutely
control the canal. But from a practical
standpoint this is Impossible. The evils
to arise '"from 'fortifications would': be
greater than those from neutrality. Forti
fications are expensive and could with dif
ficulty be maintained at such -a distance
from the United States.- If our fleet is de
stroyed "the canal^ in case we build it un
der our sole protection, will be taken away
from us and will' become a possession of
our enemy. Again, if the canal be built
without the establishment of general neu
trality every nation whose territory or
commerce is expanded will be interested
in anv movement â¢ to overcome us, which
may bring about a free canal. I think the
best interests of the United States demand
observance of the principle of neutrality."
. Rear Admiral R. D. Evans, president of
the board of inspection and survey, and
Commander J. M. Hemphill, a member of
the board, are opposed to fortifications.
Rear Admiral Evans said the j soldiers
manning, fortifications would be subjected
to malarial disease, while a fleet could He
a few miles off' and blockade the canal.
The advantages - in favor of neutrality
were greater, in his opinion, than could
be derived from fortifications, and this
opinion was joined In by Commander
Hemphill. . ;
Long interviews were had to-day be
tween Secretary Hay and Senators For
aker and Lodge, supposedly with refer
ence to the proposed canal treaty which

as Secretary Hay succeeds in his task of
reconciling the. views of -the Senate and
the administration. The talk that the Sec
retary of State has thus far had with Sen
ators on the subject ofÂ»a canal treaty has
revealed considerable opposition to any
treaty at all, some Senators insisting that
nothing more is requisite to the construc
tion of the canal than the abrogation > of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and it is' still
far from certain that a treaty can be
drafted that will command the support of
two-thirds of the Senate and still be rea

WASHINGTON. April 15.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day decided a
number of cases involving the validify
in one State of divorce decrees granted
In other States. The court held practi
cally that in cases in which the decree is
granted in States where the husband an-J
wife have made their legal residence it
Is valid In any part of the United States,
but that in other cases in which there i.s
no legal residence in the Stale if) which
ine decree is granted they are. invalid.
The opinions were handed down by Jus
tice Gray and involved the cases of At'i
erton vs. Atherton, Bell vs. Bell and
Streitwolf vs. Slreitwolf. .
In the Atherton case the husband ob
tained a decree of divorce in Kentucky,
where they had resided as husband and
wife, after the wife had left the husband
and gone to the home of her parents in
Clinton, N. . Y. In his opinion Justice
Gray called attention to and laid stres.s
upon the fact that Kentucky -was' th<y
place cf their marital residence and ho
also brought out the fact that notices of
the husband's petition for divorce haÂ«J".
been forwarded to New. York and that
she had made no response. The Kentuck /
court thereupon had granted the decree.
The question involved " was,, he said,
whether the decree was*, valifl in Nev
York, the question having been raised by
a counter proceeding of the wife for'di
vorce in New York. He concluded that
owing to the fact of her former 'residence
in Kentucky and the fact that due no*
tice had been given her, Mrs. Atherton
was as much bound by theKentucky de
cree as if she had been present in the
court when it was granted. Hence, ths
decision of the New York Supreme Cpu-t
in favor of the wife j and against the
validity of the Kentucky decree was re
versed. " Â¦â¢
The other two cases also came from
New York. In the Bell case the question
of the validity of a decree granted to the
husband in Pennsylvania was raised and
in the Streitwolf case the same question
was raised concerning a decree granted
to the husband in North Dakota. Â¦ In bo'.h
these cases, the decrees were held to be
invalid because neither the husband noÂ»"
t.ie wife had domiciled in the/ State in
which the divorce was granted. In tho?=e
cases the findings of thÂ« New York courts
â¢were affirmed.
In the Atherton case Justice Peckham
dissented on the ground that the husband
had been himself responsible for the
wife's change of residence.

DECISION ON DIV03CE LAW.
WASHINGTON'. April 15.â The United
States Supreme Court, through Chief Jus
tice Fuller, to-day issued an order grant
ing leave to iiie a motion for a rule
against the Circuit Court cf Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit to permit the filing of
an appeal in ihat court from a decision
of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in the
Wilder Steamship Company case. The
rule was made returnable May 13. Pre
vious to this action a rule was promul
gated attaching the territory of Hawaii to
the Ninth Circuit, with headquarters at
San Francisco.
The action of the court in assigning the
Territory of Hawaii to the Ninth Judicial
Circuit, and at the same time issuing a
rule to the Circuit Court of Appeals to
show cauÂ«? why it should not take, juris
diction of an admiralty case originating
in Hawaii involves an interesting general
question relating to our new territorial
possessions. The application in this case
was made by Duane E. Fox in behalf of
the Wilder Steamship Company of Hawaii
aginast Hind, Spreckels et al. Under the
act of lfSl organizing the Circuit Court of
Appeals they were given jurisdiction in
appeals from the Supreme Courts of Ter
ritories, and the Supreme Court was given
authority to assign the Territories to the
several circuits.
But the courts in the Territory of Ha
waii were organised by the act of April
30, 1S00, on a different basis from other
Territories, and the same distinction was
made ss in courts of a State as to writs
of -error and appeals, and. the Supreme
Court of the United States made no order
assigning the Territory. The act also por
vided that cases pending at the date of
the organization of the Territory should
be carried on to final judgment and ex
ecution in the corresponding courts of the
Territory. It also established a District
Court, having the -jurisdiction of United
States Circuit .md District courts.
The Supreme Court of the Territory
rendered judgment for $55,000 against the
Wilder Steamship Company, and then
when the company attempted to appeal
the Circuit Court of Appeals, on April 1,
1900, refused to entertain the appeal, hold
ing that the judgment of the Territorial
court was final.

NOW THE ISSUE
To-day's opinion affirmed the opinion -of

leged in behalf of the Call that while that
paper was taxed at the rate of $5 per 100
words, the Jcurndl was required 'to pay
only $150 per 100 words. The telegraph
company contended that its services to
the Call Company, were a matter of Inter
state commerce,' subject to regulation only
by Congress.' krid not by. State-or bycon}- ;
mon law. and that as Congress had taken
no action the- telegraph company could
not be restrained. ln r the opinion , of the
cdifffc 'Justice Brewer 'asked :.Â¦ â¢ : Â¦ ; t , <: " â¢ ". #?
."Can . It " be right that ttie great multi
tude r of; Interstate commercial transactions
'are freed -from the burdens incurred by
â¢the conimori law as'; so' defined and are
subject to no rule except that to be found
in the statutes of. Congress? We are clear

that the principles of the common law
.are operative,upon all interstate commer
cial transactions, except so far as they
are modified by Congressional- enactment."
WASHINGTON, April 13.â The case of

vor of the newspaper by the. United States

the oDinion. The Call is a Lincoln news
paper ar.d the suit was based upon the
allegation that the telegraph company had

Supreme Court Gives an Opinion
DECISION FOR NEWSPAPER.
"The validity; of such taxes is not be
fore us for determination," he said, "and
therefore we must decline to express any
opinion thereon, and yet it may not be
Improper to say that even if the sus
gested result should follow. It furnishes
in reason for not recognizing that which
in our judgment is the true construction
cf the constitutional limitation.'.'-. j.
Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of
the dissenting Justices, basing it upon the
ground that the precedents justify the
tax on foreign bills. Justice Brown con
curred only on the result reached by the
majority.
I The judgment of the District Court was
i reversed and the case remanded with ln
1 structions to grant- a new trial. -In the
' course of his opinion Justice Brewer took
cognizance of the contention that if the
duty on foreign bills of lading is not sus
tained it will follow that tonnage taxes
and stamp duties on manifests must fail
i also.
"We are of opinion that a stamp tax
on a foreign bill of lading Is in substance
and is equivalent to a tax on; the articles
included in that bill of ladinf*, and there
fore, a tax or duty on export%and in con â¢
flict with the constitutional prohibition."
The case came to the Supreme Court
from the United States District Court of
Minnesota. The decision of that court
sustained the valiaily of the law impos
ing a tax of 10 eems on expert bills of
laairsg, Fairbank being tinea $25 for his
supposed offense. Ke is an agent of the
Northern Pacihc Railroad Company and
was convicted of violating the law m
March, 19(X), the specific charge being that
of Issuing bills of lading on wheat to be
exported to England without attaching
the stamp to them as required by lav/.
The tax was resisted on the ground that
it violates the provision of tne constitu
tion requiring tr.at no "tax or duty, shall
be laid on articles exported from any
other State." The substance of thij
court's decision was embraced in the con
cluding paragraph, which follows:
WASHINGTON, April 15.â In the United
States Supreme Court an opinion was
handed down to-day In the case of Fair
bank vs. the United States. The case in
volved the constitutionality of the war
revenue law,- imposing a tax upon export
bills of lading. The court decided against
the Government, holding that provision
of the law unconstitutional. The opinion
was handed down by Justice Brewer, anJ

DECIDES AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT
As a clincher to his argument Gardiner
cites the decision of the Supreme Court
in the Neely case. .Â¦ Â£ ,
At a meeting of the National Bar Asso
ciation in Albany last January Gardiner
delivered an address in which ho answered
arguments ad\aticed by former President-
Harrison against the position of the Gov
ernment. This address attracted much at
tention an"d resulted in Gardiner being re
tained by the New England Tobacco
Growers' Association to prepare a brief in
support of the power of the Government
to levy duties on goods imported from
Porto. Rico into the United SUte3. *
Gardiner presents a line of argument to
which Attorney General -Griggs. and So
licitor General Richards devoted little or
no attention. ; He bases his argument on,
the broad ground that the "United States
is a sovereign nation; it possesses all na
tional powers enumerated In the constitu
tion and all unenumerated powers re
served to the people. . These aggregate all
powers of the most potent sovereignty and
the National Government can exercise
them all. unless expressly prohibited by
the constitution." ThhÂ» contention is the
keystone to Gardiner's brief, for it is fol
lowed by the contention that the "acqui
sition of Porto Rico and the Philippines,
the- mode and extent thereof, the delimi
tation of the boundaries of the United
States, the disposition and government of
the islands and their inhabitantsâ these
ana all similar questions in the cases' at
bar are political and not judicial and.
therefore, not within the jurisdiction of
court."
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, X.
W., WASHINGTON, April 15.â Into the
Porto Rican -and Philippine cases now
pending In the Supreme Court a new ele r
merit was introduced to-day when Charles
A. Gardiner o,f Xe-nT^Tork filed a brief on.
behalf of, the New England Tobacco Grow
ers' Association. Gardiner puts into the
record far .the first time the contention,
as in the Neely extradition case, that the_
Insular issues raised are political ques
tions with which the court has nothing
to do. The fact that the Government's
counsel objected to the reception of the
brief indicates that' they are confident of
winning: the cases.

On Friday the first husband returned

She prefers her second husband, andwill,

When the company's .latest action be
came known the citizens became greatly
excited- and hasty meetings were called
to talk over the situation. These confer
ences had but one effectâ to arouse the
populace still further against the railroad
and solidify the resolution to fight this
battle to a finish. It was declared in con
ference that if blood must be shed in pro

This morning the City Trustees, met and
granted the First street franchise to the

the action was received from the South

the city had no right to grant tl fran

claimed, included all of Firsf street. As
soon as the ordinance was passed by the

notified the company and it- at' once pro

The three prisoners were taken to En

vessel in. which the guano was to have
been taken away, was given a double
sentence of twelve months in the~ En
senada Cuartel. For some' reason un
known and without ev/n.tae form of an
explanation to Ithe captain, his sentence
was extended to eighteen months.
"I was treated like 'a wild animal," said
Captain Â¦ Thornsan to-day, "and if I at

prisoners, who were given more liberty
than I, they would run away and lock the
doors. When I- was taken to jail I had

only one- suit of clothes and one blanket
to cover me. â¢Â¦ My bed was the concrete

Thornsan was the captain of the junk

Island more than a year and a half ago
by the Mexican man-of-war Democrata.
In company -with two. other small ves

kong was being used by guano poachers.
There were, seven men in the enterprise
and four of them were able to get away
from . the gunboat, though their vessels
were taken. Captain Thornsan and his
crew of two men were captured and con

caped lived on Ellda Island for a few

VANCOUVER, B. C. April 15.â John
Llndstrom and Andrew Barton, two coast
prospectors, arrived to-day from Texada
Island, sixty-five miles from Vancouver,
with samples of one of the richest strikes
of cold ever made in British Columbia.
The free gold samples give assays of more
than $1000 to the ton, nuggets half as large
as a dime belne scattered through the
quartz. Lindstrom and Barton made the
alscovery a week ago, but did not hurry
to bring the news to Vancouver. They told
their story to miners at Vananda, on Tex
ada Island,, and about twenty men there
quit work and went out to stake claims on
the new ledge, which is about five miles
away from the water. It is situated not
far. from the iron mines which are con
trolled by the Union Iron Works of San>
Francisco. *
Lindstrom says it was only by accident
that they found the gold. They had pros
pected several hundred feet along an ordi
nary-looking- ledge showing pyrites, -and
suddenly came upon pieces of glittering
metal.- Then they dug deeper and found
plenty cf ore within a few feet of the sur
face. The ore yields several hundred dol
lars-to the ton. Apparently the find 1* an
extensive one, as they prospected the lead
for a considerable distance.
Each of the men recorded a claim for
himself on this lead and one for Allayne
Jones of this city, who had "grubstaked"
them. They -filed their papers at Vananda.
and when they had turned loose the popu
lation in that direction of the new find
they came down to Vancouver to make re
ports. Several prospecting parties are be
ing formed here to go over the district
thoroughly to see if another ledge Ilka
this- one can be found.

TERRIBLE Terry Â¦ McGovern ' and
his retinue of trainers, managers,
announcers and baggage did not
arrive ' in the city yesterday ac
cording to schedule. His coining
was eagerly awaited by the Twentieth
Century Club managers, a half-score of
newspaper menand an anxious public, but
the distinguished traveler from the classic
shades of Brooklyn did not loom up on the
horizon/ A train wreck on the route over

of his reaching the scene of his next fistic
battle before some time to-day. .â¢ â¢
Somewhere on the Nevada desert. Terry
and his retinue whiled away the fleeting
hours playing golf, with a boxing glove
for a ball, a baseball bat for a brassle and

Manager Kennedy has procured rooms
at the Palace for the McGovern party.
The featherweight champion will remain
at the hotel for a few days and then will

THE long-standing California rec
ord for six and one-half furlongs
of 1:19 3-5. made by Geraldine In
1891, was erased by Fred Cook's
crack pprlnter Tayon, i winner of
the fourth event at Tanforan yesterday,
which horse covered the route in 1:19^4.
Tayon is a prepossessing piece of racing
material when right up on edge, but the
impression generally prevailed that Head
water held him safe, and the betting Indi
cated as much, for Headwater, with
Thorpe up, closed a 9 to 5 favorite. After
Tayon the Macdonough- entry. Beau Or
monde, was next fancied. As is generally
known. Headwater Is a-horse that likes to
come from behind, and Thorpe followed
instructions to the letter. A few thought
he waited too long. At any rate, after
Sad Sam had stepped off a half in 47 sec
onds he was practically out of business,
and Domlnick on Tayon took the lead. The
last furlong the favorite closed up a
couple of lengths of intervening daylight,
but Tayon did not back up noticeably,
winning hard pressed by a half-length.
Mounce astride Beau Ormonde moved
along from sixth position, finishing in the
chow.
ICot only this particular number, but the
entire card, had a fresh look, calling out
a large gathering of turfgoers. It was
"blue Monday" so far as the favorites
were concerned, for Pat Dunne's Star
Chamber alone captured a purse. Still
the books did not keep everything in
eight, for Donator, Catastrophe. Louwel-
Bca and Tayon were well backed.
A mishap at the barrier spoiled the
chances of Hiudoonet, touted as the real
thins for the opening event and sent to
ihe j>oft favorite. When the bunch was
dispatched by Holtman, Hindoor.et in
some way got mixed up with the webbing
and was never h factor. Donator took the
lead from Rinaldo headed for home, beat
ing out the 15 to 1 outsider Gusto easily.
Alaska ran a good third.
Merops Js far from being the horse he
was last season. Favorite for the mile
and a furlon? selling affair, he led for a
mile, and then Bassinger began riding to
hold his position. . First Catastrophe, then
Faunette went by the choice, the former,
well handled by Gisbcrn. scoring by a
length. The winner was played from 7 to
2 down to 13 to. 5. Â¦- . Â¦ .. â¢ - -
"Ex-Jockey' Tom Magee's . filly Muresca
made her second public appearance in the'
baby race, at four furlongs, and, a 7 to 10
favorite, was 'gnominiously defeated. She
looked rakish but altogether too light,
and was out of It before the paddock was
reached. Louwelsea, from Johnny Camp
hell's string, piloted by Thorpe, outfooted
Toreo Maid, getting the verdict by a neck.
Of the Quartet starting in the mile run
Star Chamber looked best, and 3 to 5 in
the ring early became a scarcity. ; For
over six furlongs Dr. Cave sifted along
looking like a winner, and then resigned.
There was nothing to it though when Tur
ner called on the favorite, for he waded
to the front and Â¦won easing up from Dan
gerous Maid. Rosormonde ran as If her
best racing days were over.
Marty Bergen landed the last purse with
Silver Garter, a 20 to 1 shot, which downed
the favorite, Montallade. a nose. Marty
got his mount away well, lost no â¢ ground
and cutting away at Just the right time
had his number displayed first by a very
narrow margin. Valencienne was plunged
on at 6 and 7 to 1. but went to pieces after
leading: to within a sixteenth from the
stand. . " '

WASHINGTON, April 15.â The State
Department has been advised through the
American Embassador at . Rome and the
Italian Foreign Office that Bar^n Fava
will be succeeded as Embassador from
Italy to this country by the Marquis Obiz
zo Malisplna dl Carbonara, at present Min
ister for Italy to the Argentine Republic.
The Marqufs.has had a wide diplomatic
experience and served in Washington a3
one of the attaches of the Italian lega
tion about ten years ago. He will receive
a substantial promotion by his new ap
pointment, rising from the. rank of Min
ister to that of Embassador.
Baron Fava, the- retiring Embassador, is
a man of remarkable diplomatic experi
ence, his service in behalf of his country
covering some of the most exciting pe
riods in Italian history. He is about 65
years of age and began his diplomatic
career as secretary of the : legation at
Trieste. He subsequently took a promi
nent Dart in, a successful effort to feder
ate the Italian states, and re-entering the
diplomatic service under the famous Car
bour Ministry he became First Secretary
at Berne. Thence in turn he went to The
Hague, to Constantinople, to Roumanla
and finally to Buenos . Ayres, where he
was Minister, just as his successor is to
day.
Baron Fava came to Washington in 1881,
so he has seen twenty years' continuous
service at the American capital. In 1893
he was dean of the diplomatic corps and
only relinquished the position through the
failure of his Government to' act as
promptly as the British Government in
the matter of raising their Minister to the
rank of Embassador.
EHiringr his /diplomatic experience here
the Baron has exhibited great tact and
has passed through some- trying condi
tions. During the incumbency of Secre
tary Blalne at the State Department oc
curred the killine of the Italians in New
Orleans, Â¦which caused a serious strain
upon the relations between the United
States and Italy and incidentally led to
the recall of Baron Fava by his Govern
ment for a considerable time. Since that
event others of a like character have oc
curred, but they have all been settled sat
isfactorily, in large part owing to the tact
of the Embassador. . *
Baron Fava to-night furnished 'this
statement: "Baron Fava has not been
recalled. Owing to Important family af
fairs which require his presence in Italy
he has applied for his retirement. Baron
Fava on his return home will resume his
duties in the -Italian Senate."
Retiring Nobleman Has a Long Rec
ord of Success in Many of the
. Legations Throughout
the World
Prominent Diplomatic Offi
cial Will Now Succeed'

- The parishioners of St. Peter's Church
assembled last Sunday evening after ser
vices in St. Peter's Hall for the purpose
of taking steps toward the erection of
a new parochial residence. The meeting
was called to order by D. F. Keefe and
Dr. J. H. Doyle was selected to serve as
secretary.
It was decided that the proceeds of the
next annual parish outing: be devoted to
building a priests' I house to replace the
old structure now used for that purpose.
The project was first broached at the re
ception given to Father Casey after his
return from abroad and Instantly met with
the encouragement it deserved. Much en
thusiasm was shown by those present and
the outing gives promise of being a great
success. The carishioners of St. Peter's
Church have always been noted for their
readiness to contribute to the wellbelng
of the parish, as proven by the Easter
collection, which amounted to a considera
ble sum. and will be devoted to the build
ing fund.
Chairman Keefe appointed John Kenny
L.. Cull. Joseph I. Twohlfr. Thomas Doyle
and John E. Behan a committee to confer
with the railroad officials regarding the
selection of a suitable park for the picnic.
Later on he will appoint committees to
take the active management of affairs in
order to insure a large gathering.

PROTEST AGAINST
HIGHER LICENSE
Supervisors to - Reconsider
. Bill Raising Tax on
Street Cars.
Grand Jury Did Ifot Recommend In
crease â Ordinance Eliminating
Certain Territory From
Fire Limits Passed.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday re
referred to the . License Committee the
ordinance increasing the license tax on
street cars from $15 to $50 per annum.
Comte stated that the ordinance was hasU
ily passed to print on the alleged recom
mendation of the Grand Jury, whereas
only two of its members had requested Its
passage.
Two protests were filed against the in
creased license, one by Vice President
Holbrook of the Market Street Railway
Company and the other by Secretary
Clayton of the San Francisco and San
Mateo road. The former says:
Claims Notice "Was Not Given.
The Market street company does not wish
any litigation with tne city and desires not
to be forced into the courts to protect its
rights. Its stockholders number nearly six
hundred and its franchises are contracts of
the most binding character. There was in
corporated In these franchises a provision that
no greater sum than J15 per annum should be
Imposed as a license tax upon each car. The
tax on Its franchise ucts the city over $200,000
per year. Besides this it pays over *7Â»,000 for
repairing streets. This makes its contribution
to the public revenue amount to over $1000
per day. In addition the . company transports
iree of charge the members of the Police and
Klre departments and the school children lor
tall-fare. TlÂ« company Is entitled to pro
tection, not only from infringement of Its
ltgal rights, but also from such an unfair
tax as Is attempted in the proposed ordinance.
Secretary Clayton asked that the mat
ter be referred back to the committee on
the ground that the companies had not
been officially notified of the contemplated
raise. He refers to the franchise of the
company, which provides that no greater
sum than $15 per annum shall be collected
on the cars. His communication con
cludes:
It is unfortunate that this Question was
brought up at this time. The railroad com
panies receded from what they believed was
a legally Impregnable position in the matter
of half -fares for school children. The privilege
was conceded as a conciliatory measure â in
fact it was a chance of policy, that If the
railroads showed a disposition to treat the
public with consideration the public would not
be less generous to the railroads. At the very
first meeting after the concession there is
passed to print an ordinance more than trebling:
the license on street cars â passed In the most
arbitrary manner, without even offering the
railroad companies the courtesy of listening- to
any legitimate objections they might have to
offer.
Secretary E. P. Danforth of the Grand
Jury informed the board In a communica
tion that the ordinance increasing the li
cense was not the result of any recom
mendation of the Grand Jury, but of two
members only. Messrs. Dunn and Badger.
He states that the original resolution pre
sented by Dunn Â¦was lost by a vote of
15 to 1. Afterward Dunn asked to have
the resolution reconsidered and that mo
tion was lost.
Dunn Sends Communication
Dunn also sent a communication, in
which he says that he informed the Grand
Jury that he would present the substance
cf the recommendation, that the license be
increased, to the Supervisors, signed Indi
vidually or with such other Grand Jurors
as approved the same. Dunn says fur
ther:
In connection with the Grand Jury com
munication now beforo your honorable body I
have to state that thirteen Jurors being pres
ent, seven voted to send it while six voted no.
It will be seen that a minority of 6even has
VÂ£ed the name of the Grand Jury, which con
sists of nineteen members. It seems there is
an Intention to use indirectly whatever pres
tige may attach to tlie name of the Grand
Jury to prevent the final passage of the or
dinance.
The protest of the Fire Commissioners
against the elimination of certain terri
tory from the fire limits was referred -to
the Kire Committee, The commission
claims that the Supervisors have no au
thority to reduce the area covered by the
present limits nor to change them, except
by extension. The ordinance denning the
limits was, however, finally passed by the
board. '. > .
The ordinance imposing a license of $40
per annum on runners and solicitors'
agents was finally passed.
The ordinance for the prevention and
punishment of frauds upon street rail
roads in connection Â¦with the pupils' half
fare ordinance was finally passed.

Police Officer Henneberry had a lively
encounter on. East street yesterday after
rioon Â¦with a number of soldiers. He ar
rested a man dressed in the uniform of a
sergeant of cavalry, and was taking him
to the Receiving Hospital. The man gave
his name as John Lynch and admitted he
Â¦was not a soldier. .Henneberry was sur
rounded by a howling mob, an alarm was
rung in and Sergeant Shaw and posse,
dashing up in a patrol wagon, rounded up
five soldiers. They were charged with dis
turbing the peace at the Harbor Station,
but, on the. arrival of an armed guard

Uippon Maru Has Boug-h Trip.
Recent advices from Yokohama indicate
that the Nippon Maru of the Toyo Kis jn
Kaisha line. Captain W. W. Greene com
manding, had a very rough time on her
last voyage from this port, commencing
on February 9. Scarcely had the Nippon
Maru cleared the Golden Gate than her
nose stuck into a gale which lasted until
within a few hours of Honolulu. After
leaving the Island port more trouble was
encountered. On February 21 a big sea
cerried away the gangway ladder and
awnings on the upper deck, besides twist
ing the iron stanchions. On February 23 a
heavy squall, accompanied by thunder
lightning and a heavy rain, made things
un comfortable for all on board. On March
5 the seas broke over the bridge. Yoko
hama was reached on March 10. The
steamer had 60 cabin and 200 steerage pas
6enÂ£-ers.

WISCONSIN BACK FROM CRUISE.
Went to Magdalena Bay for Target
The United States battleship "Wisconsin,
Captain Reiter commanding, returned
from her maiden cruise yesterday and the
officers and men speak loudly In praise
of her sea-going qualities. The "Wisconsin
left here on March 12 for Magdalena Bay,
an average speed of 10 knots being main
tained going down, the bay being reached
on the morning of the 17th. As soon as
the preliminary preparations had been
made, target practice was indulged in.
Every gun on the ship was fired and the
results are considered remarkable, espe
cially in view of the fact that the crew
has been in service only six months. A
mountainous bluff was whitewashed and
marked off to resemble a ship. Every
shot struck. The big guns were fired at
ranges of 2600 and 3400 yards.
Then the men were landed and all kinds
of drills were engaged in. The Mohican,
was in the bay at the same time and two
races were held between the rival crews
for purses of $S0 and $40 each. The Wis
consin's gig crew won the three mile and
a half racw*y three minutes and the ap
prentices won the- second race of two
mile3 by twenty seconds. Considerable
money changed hands on the results.
In his report of the cruise to the Secre
tary of the Navy Captain Reiter sneaks
highly of the results. Out of 444 men in
the crew 137 qualified as first-class marks
men, 156 as second class and 86 as third
class. The prize-winners were fifty-nine.
They were required to make 66 points out
of a possible SO. The highest individual
score was 75 out of a possible SO.
The concussion of the big guns did but
little damage, although a couple of chairs
were knocked down, one smashing the
panel of a door In the after cabin.
Going down the -trip was made under
four boilers, but on the return trip six
were used. As the vessel has not been on
the dry dock since she was launched slow
time was made. The "Wisconsin left Mag
delena Bay last Thursday and came in
through a dense land fog yesterday morn
irg.

A CHANCE TO SMILE
DEMOCRACY being in need of a new leader
and not perceiving any sign of one in the do
main of national* politics is now engaged in
looking for the object of desire among politicians of
local repute. In the search attention has been natu
rally given to the" three Democrats who were suc
cessful in the municipal elections in Chicago, St.
Louis and Cleveland. Neither of the three would ever
have been thought of iri times past as a Presidential
probability, but times have changed, and now each of
them has a circle of admiring friends who suggest that
h? would make an excellent substitute for Bryan on
tlie next national Democratic ticket.
All suggestions of that kind in regard to Harrison
of Chicago have met with rebuff ' the moment they
were heard of outside the city. Mr. Harrison is too
well known. The supporters of Wells of St. ' Louis
have also had to face a cold reception.'. Mr. Wells 'is
not sufficiently known. Thus the third man,
the noted Tom L. Johnson of Cleveland, has some
thing that looks at this stage of the game like a walk
over. At least he is so far ahead of his rival municipal
magnates that unless some man of national repute de
velop an unexpected stiength, or some dark horse as
yet unheard of be brought out, it is probable that for
a little while at least Tom Johnson will have -the big
gest Presidential boom in the Democratic camp.
The friends of Johnson assert that he possesses ex
actly the faculties that are needed in a leader and a
statesman. Heis'-a successful man* of businessman
ardent politician, a consistent Democrat to the extent
at least that although opposed to free silver he sup
ported Bryan, and, finally, is said to. have the vim,
vigor and energy that are required for success.' . He is
better and more widely known than Wells of St. Louis'
and not so thoroughly known as Carter Harrison:
People have heard of him outside of his own city'.and
his own State, a'nd have not heard anything ; worse'
about him than that he is a Bryanite. Finally,, as his
friends never fail to add, he is an Ohio man. .-
By way of disclosing to the people at large the
quality of their candidate the friends of Johnson are
chculating the story: of how he defeated a scheme
TOM L. JOHNSON HAS A BOOM.
Spring has opened up in the East this year with
more than its usual severity; where there have not
been wind storms there have been floods; and the
Pacific Coast appears to be theonly part of the Union
where one can sing without swearing the good old
refrain: "Hail, gentle spring."
It is probable that whenever the small college is
assailrd that sentence of Webster's will rise in its de
fense.
Dartmouth is identified with one of the greatest
professional triumphs c 1 Daniel Webster. In thar
case he established a precedent in favor of vested
rights which long stood undisturbed. It is worthy of
rote that, incident to that celebrated case, was the
charge by the opposing interest that Dartmouth was
a small college. This fv.rnished Webster' the oppor
tunity to make one of the few displays of sentiment
known in the presentation of cases before the Supreme
Court of the United .St-itcs. In his oral argument tc
that dignified bench he r.aid: "It is true that Dart
mouth is a small college but there are those who love
it." No phrase could b? more simple, but uttered by
Webster, in a voice that perceptibly broke, it brought
bctore the mind's eye cf the grave Judges and of
many in the distinguished company within the bar of
the court all the pleisure and the pathos of early,
memories and the debt due for sound training in somt
small college or humble school and the beginning
therein of honorable careers. It is # said that a thrill
seemed to pass through the audience and the robed
court, and every man was for an instant a youth once
more, with ambition swelling his heart and the fu
ture rising before him like a land of enchantment.
The sons of Dartmouth are widely scattered over
this country and the world, and everywhere bear tes
timony to the soundness of their mother college.
He will find here no unfriendly atmosphere. When
antagonism between the smalland large colleges ana
tuuversities was suggested not long ago President
Jordan nobly vindicated the smali institutions and de
clared that mere size was no guarantee of usefulness
and excellence. President Wheeler was equally m
phatic in demonstrating that the heads of our great
institutions feel no jealousy of the small ones.
In the discussion of ihe proposition "no small col
lege was more frequently quoted as an example than
Dartmouth. The presence of Dartmouth's president
In California suggests that such institutions may se:
their future welfare in such visits as Dr. Tucker. iÂ«
n-aking.
At first glance it ii somewhat difficult to see at
v.hat point legislation could unfavorably affect the
small colleges. Still, t'.iere are many ways. The value
of the degrees they confer may depend upon their
corporate existence, inÂ«i the law can take the life
of a corporation or ;o enfeeble it as to destroy the
force upon which its influence depends. The use"
of the power of taxation has proved a potent weapo'i.
We have seen it used hy the Federal Government to
destroy State banks of issue, and, lifted out of its
primitive purpose, which was the raising of revenue,
it is invoked to impair the manufacture of certain
articles which compete with products already estab
lished. Of this the oleomargarine legislation is an in
stance. As most of the small colleges aresupportel
by private contributions, many of them depending
upon religious denomiiv-lioris, it is shrewdly suspected
that this novel movement originated with the people
and the denominations' which bear the burden of their
endowment and maintenance. It is by no means. an
unlikely supposition. But, whatever its origin, the
proposition did not find favor with the thinkers and
educators of the country. The small colleges have a
record that cannot be impeached and by their work
have proved their right to exist.
DURING the past winter there appeared in sev
eral States a tei!d"ency toward legislation un
favorable to the continued existence of small
colleges and universities. The origin of the move
ment was obscure. It was not traced to the direct
a^encj- of the large institutions. The institutions
which enjoy a large private endowment seemed as
clear of the charge of promoting it as did the great
Stite universities. Yet the movement was apparent
and threatened to become formidable. . . i-Jl
DARTMOUTH COLLEGE.
The influence of Germany in the Pacific
has been brought - about chiefly, through
the work of chartered companies. > Her
protectorate in China over the territory
German Authority in China,
Such was the condition of things when
Germany entered Africa, where most, of
her colonies are, and precipitated the-par
tition of that continent in 1884. Up to that
'time the colonization movement from the
political point of view had not found
much: favor in the eyes of German offi
cials. Even as late as' 1884 Prince Bis
marck asserted that It was not . the In
tention of Germany to found provinces,
but rather to promote, trade . enterprises
(kaufmannische unternehmungen). He
had in mind giving charters to trading,
companies, as England had done earlier,
and such charters, guaranteeing protec
tion '_ were issued in 18S5 by, the. Emperor
to two companies, the "Society for Ger
man Colonization" and the "New Guinea
Company." â¢
â¢ Yet in spite of the want ; of initiative
on the part of the . Government, there
grew up . on its part, after the founding
of the empire* the practice of settling Cer
tain difficulties which arose in the colo
nies; this in turn led to Germany's assum
ing control over those colonies. whose ter
ritory was not under the immediate con
trol of other nations. Thus, in southwest
Africa, where British protection had dwin
dled to almost nothing. Germany stepped
in ; and established between - 1884 and 1890
a protectorate over considerable territory
just northwest of Cape Colony. In much
the same way, and by making treaties
with the native chiefs, protectorates were
established even earlier over Togoland
and the Cameroons. along the Gold coast.
After the protectorate on the west coast,
such protectorates became a positive pol
icy on the part of the" German Govern
ment.' In the scramble for territory which
followed between Germany and the other
nations. Germany secured between 1885
and 1S50 the territory in East Africa,
which is her largest colony. .-.. ' â¢
Hand in hand with the aroused interest
at home, another factor looking to the
holding, of colonies was . the growth . of
the German navy, which not only took
large numbers of German sailors and ex
plorers over the seas and acquainted them
with new countries but was absolutely
necessary before territory could be held
in distant lands. .
Charters for Colonizing Companies.
It was reserved for the German Colonial
Society, founded at Frankfort, December
6, 18S2, to turn attention to a . country
where the political control of territory
might be obtainedâ Africa. By the follow
ing year this society had a membership of
over 3000, which since then has increased
to considerably over 20,000. The year fol
lowing its organization it gave the colo
nial movement a great impulse by issuing
a manifesto in which it stated that the
activity of the society would be directed
toward certain districts, especially the
basins of the Niger and the Congo, where,
it was urged, the German Government
should take steps to prevent other Euro
pean nations from getting a foothold.
Even as early as 1881-2 Prince Bismarck,
urged by these different societies, had en
tertained serious plans for acquiring a
hold in the Congo basin. A, year or two
later, after asking the Chambers of Com
merce of Hamburg, Bremen and Lubeck
to express their views as to what would
be the most effective means of protecting
and encouraging German trade in Africa,
Bismarck received replies pointing to an
nexation. The Hamburg Chamber of Com
merce especially urged the annexation of
independent coast regions. General inter
est in the movement was fostered by the
publication of jnany books on the subject,,
as well as periodicals, of which Export
and Deutsche Kolonlal Zeitung are repre
sentative.
Turning Attention to Africa.
In 1868 another most important society
was organized, whose objects were "the
study of those lands in which organized
German settlements already exist; the
study. of the social and commercial condi
tions and the spread of information there
on; the promotion of emigration to regions
where settlers of German origin* are al
ready established Under conditions favor
able to the genius of the German people;
the promotion of intellectual and material
intercourse between colonial' settlements
and the Ge.rman fatherland, and', lastly,
furthering the establishment of trade and
navigation and the acquisition of colo
nies." This society, which- was called the
"Central Society for Commercial Geogra
phy and the Promotion of .German Inter
ests Abroad," had its headquarters in Ber
lin, with branch establishments in the
leading cities of the empire, and even in
Brazil, the Argentine republic and New
South Wales. In. the decade following a
number of othor societies were organized,
with branches wherever German commer
cial interests could be promoted. These so
cieties, however, while directing their ef
forts toward countries where large cum
bers of German settlers were to be found,
were I directing them toward , countries
where political control was out of the
question, as the territory was already un
der the jurisdiction of other nations.
Another Important Society.
Brazil. A considerable share of emigra
tion was turned to that region, where to
the present day there are numerous flour
ishing German colonies, or, as they would
better be called, settlements, for the terri
tory which they occupy belongs to the
Brazilian Government.
Cost of German Colonies.
The total cost of administering the col
onies in 1808-9 was nearly $5,000,OQI}.- while
the revenue was considerably less than
$1,000,000. the deficit of about $4,000,000 be
ing met by imperial grants. Togoland
alone is self-supporting, having a reve
nue and expenditure of about $100,000.
Many of the imperial grants are made for
the purpose of building railroads and
bridges, improving harbors, etc., and as
yet it is too soon to look for returns. It
is an investment with the hope of returns
at a later day. Nor has trade with her
colonies increased Germany's commerce to
any considerable extent. In 1S96 the value
of all the imports of the colonies amount
ed, in round numbers, to $5,600,000, while
the value of their exports was only $2,900 -
000. Of the imports of the colonies Ger
many sends but 42 per cent, while Great
Britain and her possessions send 25 per
.cent, and varioÂ«s other colonies are the
scene of steady development. In Africa
the territory is. being surveyed, a scien
tific meteorological service has been estab
lished and various experiments are being
made in developing the natural resources
of the country, so that of all the colonies
there those of Germany bid fair to be the
most fully studied and the best known.
Even if they should not become com
mercially profitable; Germany, no doubt
will continue to hold its colonies for the
sake of political power and prestige.
A glance at the map will show that
nearly all the German colonial territory is
in the tropical or subtropical regions, and
is, therefore, not well suited to German
emigrants, and but few have gone there,
as the above figures show. The larger por
tion of these emigrants still go to more
congenial regions in the temperate zones.
So far, therefore, as colonizing her own
emigrants goes, the German movement
has not been a success. Nor has it been a
success as yet from the financial point of
view.
Â¦ Togoland, on the Gold Coast, has an
area of 23,000 square miles and an estimat
ed population of 2,500,000, of whom only 107
are Germans. An imperial governor rep
resents the empire there. The Cameroons,
situated farther down the coast, have an
area of over 191,000 square miles and a
population of over 3,50tr,000. Of this num
ber only 425 are Europeans, and of these
only 348 are Germans. The government is
administered 1 by an imperial governor.
German Southwest Africa has an area of
322,450 square miles and a poulation of
about 200,000. There are 2S72 Guropeans,
of whom only 1557 are Germans. An im
perial commissioner administers the gov
ernment. German East Africa has an area
of 334,180 square miles and a population of
over 4,000,000.- Of these 1090 are Europeans,
Â£81 being Germans. In Togoland and the
Cameroons the chief products are palm
oil, palm kernels, caoutchouc, ivory, bark,
cacao and coffee. Southwest Africa-ex
po: ts hide3, horns, ostrich feathers, tan
ning materials, guano and raw hides.
From East Africa the chief exports are
ivory, gum, â¢ cocoanuts and hippopotamus
tusks. The islands of the Pacific under
German influence have an area of nearly
100,000 square miles and a population of
400,000, and are all under the direct control
of the New Guinea company, excepting
the Marshall Islands, which are eon
trolled by an imperial commissioner. The
products are, of course, tropical. Since
1894 the control of all the colonies has been
in the hands of the imperial chancellor.
Germany in tlie Colonies
is controlled by an imperial governor and
a garrison of 1500 officers and men.
The surest and safeit way" of getting good citizens
to the polls is to nominate men in whom such citizens
have confidence, and for whose election they are will
ing to work and to voh\ A compulsory law might
force such men to go tc the polls, but if they liked
the candidate of neither party they would scatter their
votes and no particular bertefit would result from.it.
The advisability .of compulsory voting has, however,
been so lorlg discussed that it would be well to have
a commonwealth of the first rank, make an experiment
with it, and if Pennsylvania enact such a law the rest
of the country will watch the result with keen interest.
It will be conceded that absenteeism from the polls
is a grave evil/ for strangely enough the absentees
Â£.re generally of the better class of citizens, the men
upon whom a community depends for- the election
of capable and honest officials. Anything which can
induce the attendance or such men to their political
duties is beneficial, but it is doubtful whether a com
pulsory voting law would have that effect. It not in
frequently happens that the good citizen remains away
from the polls* not because he is indifferent, but be
cause he has sound reasons for objecting to the can
didates of his party.* lie remains away as a rebuke
to the bosses, as a means of proving to them that they
cannot count -on the vote of good citizens when weak
men or "ring" men are nominated.' .
A similar condition of'affairs prevailedjin Chicago
In the . strong Republican 'wards - of that city the
Republican vote fell off 37 per cent from the vote of
last fall, and throughout all. the wards there was^an
almost equal decline in the voting strength of the
party. In that city, then, as well as in St. Louis,
Democratic victory implies no increase of Democratic
strength, but only a spirit of political apathy on the
part of thousands of citizens who usually vote the Re
publican ticket.
, Upon that showing there has arisen in the East a
discussion of the advisability of enacting a compulsory
voting law, imposing penalties upon the citizen who
willfully neglects that important duty. A bill of the
kind is now before the Pennsylvania Legislature and
appears to have a fair chance of passage. â¢ !
A COMPARATIVE study of. the votes cast at
the recent municipal elections in St. Louis an'l
Chicago shows tliat the Democratic successes
were due solely to the* fact that Republican voters ic
mained away from the polls in greater numbers than
Democrats. Thus in St. Louis the Republican vote
in the Presidential election was 60,608, and the Demo
cratic vote 59,941. In the recent election the Repub
lican vote, fell to 34,84c", while the Democratic vote
was 43,012. It will be seen that' upward of 17,000
Democrats stayed at home on the day of the muni
cipal election, or voted for the "Municipal, Owner
ship" candidates, while about 26,000 Republicans
showed the same indifference to the contest.* .

Cal. The following is given as the
method for tanning any kind of skin
with the fur on: "Cut oft the useless

move the fatty matter from the Inside
and soak in warm water for an hour.
Next mix equal parts of borax, saltpeter
and glauber salts in the proportion of
about half an ounce of each for each
shin with, sufficient water to make a thin
paste; spread this with a brush over the
inside of the skin, applying more on the
thicker parts than on the thinner. Double
the skin together, flesh side inward and
put in a cool place. After twentysfour
hours wash the skin clean and apply in
the same manner as before a mixture of
one ounce of salsoda, half an ounce of
borax and two ounces of hard white
soap melted slowly together without be
in? allowed to boil; fold together again
and put in a warm place for twenty-four
hours. After this dissolve four ounces of
alum, eight ounces of salt and twa^ouncea
of saleratus in sufficient hot rainwater to
saturate the skin: when cool enough not
to scald, the hands soak the skin in It for
twelve hours, then hang it up to dry.
Kepeat Â«oaking and drying two or -three
times untir the skin is sufficiently soft.
Lastly smooth the inslde f> with fine sand

The German colonies and protectorates
are "spheres of influence" rather- than
colonies in the usually accepted sense of
that term; and they lie In Africa, the Pa
cific Ocean and China. The aggressive
movement for territorial extension began
during- the Chancellorship of Prince Bis
marck, -with the rise of the German navy
and the organization of a large number
of societies, whose chief object was the
extension of German commerce. The first
of these societies was organized as early
as. 1843, in Dusseldorf, for the promotion
of .emigration to Brazil. Other similar so
cieties were soon established, some di
recting- their attention to Texas, some to
the . Mosquito coast and still others to
Nicaragua and to Chile. ; In 18S9 a society
was founded at' Berlin for the purpose of
directing colonization toward Southern
along Kiaochau Bay. which is the most
recent acquisition of importance, was
brought about by the murder of
two German missionaries, who had
lived for some time in an inland"
village, wherevtheir presence had become
obnoxious to the natives. They were pre
paring: to â¢ celebrate a church festival In
a manner which offended the natives. Tna
result was an uprising, in which the mls-J
sionaries were murdered. Time was not
allowed the Chinese in which to make an
investigation. Within two weeks a Ger
man sauadron appeared in the bay. Ad
miral Diedrichs, who was in charge of
the squadron, was greeted with courtesy
by the Chinese officials, who looked upon
his. visit as one of ceremony â and so it
was. An indemnity for the murders, con
trol over 2740 square miles was obtained,
with mining and railway concessions in
the province of Shantung:, and a German
protectorate was established. The prov

PARTISAN 'rancor, worked out through > the
courts of law,, or directed to the destruction of
their independence, has been checked in two
Southern States, and the check must somewhat re
pair the self-respect of the people of that section.
The Kentucky Supreme Court has granted new
trials to, the two men convicted of the murder of
Goebel. The crime itself was an appalling assault
upon civilization. The offenses of Goebel against the
suffrage were corrigible by legal methods and by or
derly processes. They were scarlet sins against the
genius of free government. But free government is
a worthless fiction unless it carry within itself the
means for peacefully righting every wrong that may
be committed against it. If assassination is. the only
resource in such a case the government is worthless;
it has no self-healing." power and only cumbers the
earth with something in;t useful to mankind.
The assassination of Goebel was a confession that
5:i the conception of its authors free government is a
failure and a fraud, and that the 'only basis of social
order is force, not publicly but privately "and crimi
nally administered. But Judge Cantrill's court accepted
just that view of government, only amending it so
as to make a court of tew the instrument of the law
less use of power. His rulings and his partisanship in
the trial'of these men were the most farcical travesty
of justice. The offer of a reward of $100,000 for thj
conviction of somebody for Goebel's murder set the
perjury machine in motion, and in the trial every rule
of evidence, by law and procedure established for the
security of rights, was shamelessly violated. Quaking
wretches, whose perjury had been suborned, confessed
their offense, but their sacramental lies had weighed
with the jury and counted in its verdict.
The Supreme Court has vindicated justice" and has
recorded the certificate of its belief thai free govern
ment can correct all disorders without violating a
single rule of law or requirement of justice.
The wretched victims of the misuse of judicial
power may be guilty, but their conviction by irregu
lar and outragous judicial vengeance established a
precedent that might cost many an innocent man his
life had it been allowed to stand unchallenged by su
perior judicial authority. Let them be tried again by
processes purged of their partisan poison, and if fairly
convicted let them suffer the penalty. J â¢
In North Carolina partisanship attempted the im
peachment of Republican Justices of the Supreme
Court upon the pretense that they had usurped the
functions of the Legislature. The usurpation con
sisted in passing upon the constitutionality of the acts
of that body. But what are constitutions and courts
for? If a man find his enjo3'ment of rights, guaran
teed to him by the constitution, taken away by the
Legislature, where shall he go, under our system of
government, to seek recovery of what he has lost?
The courts are constituted for that very purpose. To
them alone' can the divested citizen go for reinvest
ment with that which the constitution gives and the
Legislature tries to take away.
The effrontery of the attempt to impeach the
Judges was exhibited when it was shown that the
Democratic Justice of the court had done exactly
what the Republican Justices were impeached* for
doing, -but he was left cut of the proceedings, and
with the foul spirit of & harp3' aided all he dared in the
attempt to convict his colleagues! The leader in the
Legislature for impeachment is an aspirant for the
United States Senate, and took such desperate means
to make himself solid with the party. But, as in the
Kentucky case, free government was vindicated and
the Judges were acquitted.
; John Marshall settled it; for all time that American
courts are the custodians of. the constitutional rights
of the people. The legislative branch of the. Govern
ment may err, ignorantly or with design. It may
contravene the constitution and exceed its powers.
If its acts are not subject to judicial review by the
rationalizing processes of the courts the constitution
becomes waste paper, as void of saving virtue as the
wrapper of a pound of tea.
" These two incidents mark the turn in the tide of
public opinion. Ever since Mr. Bryan adopted the
Chicago platform there has been a growing disposi
tion to either dislodge judicial authority altogether or.
to use it for partisan ends.
The culmination of this tendency was reached in the
Kentucky trials and the North Carolina impeachment.
The reversal in one case and failure in the other mark
the death of Brytmism. The two decisions are its
epitaph. It is buried like a dead swashbuckler, and
no mourners go about the streets.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The soundness of such statements is unquestion
able. Mr. Johnson must give three-cent fares to the
people of Johnstown cr else Democracy will have to
start once more on her forlorn search for a Bryan
beater.
It must not be supposed that Johnson's boom meets
none but favorable responses. The Johnstown (Penn.)
Democrat, for example, says: "There is a disposition
in some quarters to make three-cent fares for Johns
town a test of Tom L. Johnson's sincerity. Mr. John
sn:i is the president of the Johnstown Passenger Rail
way Company, and it h said that. he is in absolute
control of the property as the owner of a majority of
the stock. If that be the case those who are already
figuring on having to beat him for President in 1904
are prepared to bring forward a failure on his part to
reduce fares in this city as proof that he has been
talking in Columbus and Cleveland for effect. And of
course he and his friends would find such a situation
rather an awkward one to deal with when it came to
an explanation. It would be difficult to make it ap
pear that three-cent faros were all right in Cleveland
and not all right here. It would be equally difficult
to show why he favored three-cent fares for street car
lines controlled by Mark Hanna and opposed three
cent fares on a road controlled by himself. A small
matter like this might discredit his whole claim upon
the public confidence. It might make his nomination
impossible; or, if that were gained, it might defeat
him at the polls." â¢
to transfer a part of the '-lake -front- at Cleveland to the
Pennsylvania Railroad. It appears that the City
Councilhad passed an ordinance making the transfer
arid it was known that the Mayor would sign it. The
rest of the story is thus told by the Springfield Re
publican:. "Johnson went into court and secured an
order restraining the Mayor, for a stated period, from
signing the bill. That penod expired at n o'clock last^
Thursday morning. At 23 minutes after icr o'clock
Johnson went before the City Cle^k and asked for the
certificate of his .election, which had just been pre
pared. He then presented his official bond duly made
out, took the oath of office before a notary and had
public record made of the exact hour of the dayâ
having in mind possible legal proceedings from the
railroad company. He then hastened to the Mayor's'
office and took possession â the retiring Mayor being
unceremoniously requested to move out. Thus John
son came into possession of the office a few minutes
before the court's order expired, and the ordinance in
question will not be signed."

Analysis of the causes of the big busi
ness attending the* production of "The
Idol's Eye" at the Tivoli is perhaps futile;
the people fancy it, and that is enough to
insure success. . That the music Is catchy
is beybnd question, for people "leave the
theater hummingthe air of "Fairy Tales"
and other numbers. The dialogue and situa
tions are funny, for the people laugh. But
there is something more in the piece than
a mere blending of music and wit and that
is the way in which one situation is dove
tailed Into another. One complication
follows another with remarkable rapidity,
but there is a bearing, a connection, . in
short there is a plot, which many of the
musical pieces of the day lack. Then
there is the Occidental dress In the Orien
tal surroundingr, which is another factor
that aids to popularize the production '
The whole thing is farcically breezy, and
there you are. The house is,- filled to

The farce comedy, "Oh Susannah," was
revived at the Alcazar Theater last night
to a crowded house and the laughter was

Another "best ever" is the record of the
Orpheum this week, with a varied and ex
cellent bill. Leading- the interest Is Frau
cesca Redding and her company in one
of Will Cressy's sketches entitled "Her
Friend From Texas," a laughable one-act
farce. . Miss Redding as the willful widow
Is amply entertaining- and Arthur Larkin
does a clever sketch of the newly fledged
society youth. Horace Goldin, Illusionist,
does one of the neatest conjuring acts we
have seen here for oome time, capably as
sisted by Jean Fransldi and company.
Nice Barbaresehi and Vittorio Castellano,

companies, are well received in some se
lections from grand opera â which possibly
might be better chosen. Miss Barbareschi

The staging of the play is always satis
factory and sometimes, as in act 2, really
beautiful. A realistic mob and fairly
played minor parts add to the interest of
the performance. Considering the small

hide its diminished head, being glad to
confess that there is much to praise and
little to blame. L. DU PONT SYLE
Those who saw that bad play, "Quo
Vadis," last year at the Columbia Thea
ter may remember that there was one
good actor among the many bad ones
who then strutted their little hour upon
the stage. That actor was Mr. Mason
Mitchell, whom it was a pleasure to see
last night worthily enacting a worthy
partâ that of Clssius. As to Mr: Cum
mings (Brutus), that gentleman was evi
dently suffering from a bad cold, which
made it impossible for him to do justice
to his lines. His action was dignified and
appropriate. Mr. Robert Scott played
Caesar excellently, making as much of a.
success as was possible out of a char
acter of which the author has confessed
ly made a failure. Mr. Downing I hal
never seen except as Spartacus; as An
tony he was a pleasant surprise. There
is a tender side to that highly dib
reputable â¢ ward politician, man-about
town, captain of horse and master of
rhetoric, which Shakespeare has indicat
ed clearly enough, but which neither Mr.

they fail to do he does and does well.
After a long series of rapid and lurid
melodramas the Central Theater last
night made a successful attempt at some
thing better by producing "Julius
Caesar." For this play you need at least
four good actorsâ that is, three more than
are commonly found at a lo\v-price*d thea
ter. I cannot truthfully say that in my
opinion Messrs. Belasco & Thall have
given us four of this production, but they
have certainly given iis three and I am
therefore three times as thankful as I had
any right to hope I might be.

The Union Fish Company's vessel Czar

crew of the schooner Anna, consisting of
the captain and nine men. The Anna be

long fishing trip. . â¢ Â¦
The two v vessels were fishing In close
neighborhood to each other, and during
the winter,' when a severe storm arose,
both made fdr the island of Samak, an
choring in harbors only a few miles apart.
The storm was one ! of exceptional vio
lence, and being In an exposed situation
the Anna's anchor dragged and she was
cast on the beach.
The crew with difficulty escaped tor land
and made the best of their way across the
island to the Czarina. They were taken
aboard and worked with the crew of the
sister ship during the remainder of the
season. .The Anna and her half-cargo were
an entire loss. â¢ â¢ Â¦ ,-'

RECALL DAYS
OF DARTMOUTH
The coming session of the Grand Parlor
cf the Native Sons of the Golden West,
Judging from present indications, will be
productive of some of the stormiest con
tests In the history of the order. Besides
the three keen fights which are being
made for the offices of grand second vice
president, grand secretary and grand trus
tees, an amendment to the constitution
will l^e Introduced which will undoubtedly
arouse great opposition. The proposed
amendment is for the purpose of making
the order more exclusive by restricting
the membership to persons born within
the State on or prior to September 9, 1900,
or to persons who are the lineal descend
ants of those born within the State on
or prior to September 9. 1900.
As the constitution now reads a family
may come from the Eastern States and
locate here and a child born after their
arrival, when he attains the age of 18
years is entitled to become a member of
the order. The amendment is calculated
to change this. It is argued by the spon
sors of the amendment that as. the order
was founded for th'e perpetuation of the
memories of pioneer life its membership
should be restricted to the sons of the
pioneers and <he early settlers, as they
are the ones bcft capable of appreciating
and venerating California's early histor
ical events and traditions.
The object of the amendment Is not to
curtail the membership of the order, but
to increase it by making It more distinc
tive and a source of family pride. The pro
posers of the change claim that it Is nat
ural for man to be proud of the heroic
achievements cf his ancestors, and that
he will join with others similarly affected
in commemorating their valorous deeds,
but that he will not so willingly associate
himself with strangers who have no per
sonal interest Â«n the natter.

NEW YORK. April 15.â It was plainly to be
teen to-day that the influential assemblage of
professional operators in stocks which has led
the great bull market of this year throughout
was " making an abrupt shift from the high
priced railroad' stocks into the industrial 6tocks
Ot all grades, down to many that are in the
Stock Exchange category of "cats and dogs."
Very buoyant advances were effected in many
of these.' and the unfailing following of out
â¢ld'it speculators which has quickly followed
this leadership for many weeks past continued
Its docile. response to-day. There was a very
flagrant manipulation in the caee of many of
these advances and in others there was a
very large and apparently urgent demand
which argued knowledge of coming favorable
developments. A very notable feature of the
market was that profit-taking in the railroad
list persisted throughout the buoyant . rise
among the specialties. Prices of the railroads
Â¦were opened high, helped by some speculative
demand for London -account, the latter factor
being especially notable in Southern Railway
preferred. But the opening prices in the rail
roads or those made during the first hour
proved to be the highest In very many cases.
Railroad Etocks generally show net losses on
the day, although an effort was made to sup
port them at the last, lifting some of them
from the lowest New York Central had re
ceded to lMV. in the last hour and was made
to sell on the next and last eale at 152%, the
closing bid dropping back again to 151%. with
l.'l% asked. By far the most conspicuous move
ment of the day. owing to the enormous vol
ume cf the dealings, was in Amalgamated Cop
per. The stock fell back at Intervals on-profit
taking after its wide opening at 117 to 120.
compared with 115 at the close on Saturday.
In the final dealings it was rushed up through
a flood of offerings to 124%, closing at the top
notch. There were notable upward movements
In all the gas stocks, led by Consolidated Gas
and Brooklyn Union Gas with advances of
6% and 10 respectively. People's Gas rose at
one time nearly 5 points. There wÂ«re gains of
4% In Metropolitan Street Railway, 3\i in
Sugar. 7H in Chicago Terminal, 8 In -the pre
ferred, I0Â«i in Colorado Fuel and 4 in Tennes
eee Coal. Other gains of from 1 to ( points
are accounted for by such stocks as Interna
tional Pump, Texas and Pacific Lartd and Trust-
National Lead, American Unseed Oil stocks
National Salt preferred, American Snuff prel
ferredi Glucose Â¦ and New York Air Brake.
The only real notable advance In the railroad
Itet was In the high-priced coalers. Cleveland.
Columbus, Cincinnati and St. Louis, which
rose 4%, and Mexican National, which was
lifted 2\* on large buying. Burlington was at
one time carried Vk under Saturday and Rock
Inland 2 points. Call money did not rise
â¢ bove C per cent to-day, and eased off during
New York Stock- Market.
EASTERN MARKETS.
Â¦S : X
CHICAGO, April 15.â So thoroughly . had
traders discounted the bearish statistics Sat
urday that when the imposing figures appeared
to-day the wheat market was In a position to
ignore them. World's shipments last week were
10,105.000 bushels, while the amount of wheat
and flour on ocean passage increased 3,480,000
bushels, swelling ! the amount to 49,548,000
bushelsâ the largest aggregate ever known.
Added to these statistics was the perfect April
weather, which completed the array of bear
news. On the other hand cables were steady,
though lower, receipts moderate and the cash
demand, according to reports which helped
the market from time to time, better. Heavy
clearances from the seaboard and the visible
decrease also contributed to the . strength.
Trade was generally dull and lacking in specu
lative features. May opened %c lower to a
shade higher at 70%@70%<570%c and gradually
advanced, mostly on covering by local shorts,
to 70%@71c, closing firm, %c higher at 70%c.
Speculative action in corn was almost at a
standstill. The Philllns "May deal" is ap
parently affecting Â¦ traders but little, although
there is no evidence that the young bull leader
has relinquished his heavy line. He has
changed some May corn over to Jnly. Un
favorable seeding weather, firm cables and
sympathy with wheat gave the market a firm
tone. May closed %c higher at 43%c.
Os.ts were dull, but firm. May closed %c
higher at 25%c
Dullness, ruled in the provision pit most of
the day, especially m products of May de
livery, the bulk , of business now being done
for July delivery. May pork closed 15c lower;
July, 12%c down; May lard, 5c depressed, and
July a shade easier; May ribs 7%c higher and
July unchanged. . .

Raisins and Apricots in New York.
Mall sdvices from â¢ New York say: "The
market on California raisins was greatly ex
cited and urset yesterday by the announce
ment of a cut on coast seeded raisins in 1-lb
cartons to 5c. f. o. b.. California. This will
permit the coast product to be laid down here
Lt 6^c. or lVit'Sl^c lower than the spot market
"at the time the news of the cut came to hand.
Uood quality coast eeeded have been selling
of late at 7U<&7V-c, and in some cases at
'slightly higher quotations.
"One of two houses on the street possibly
had a few hours' warning of the contemplated
move by the Kaisin Growers' and Packei-s'
associations, but to the trade generally the
drop came absolutely unheralded, and the lo
cal market at once became demoralized. Al
though no new goods can be brought to the
New York market from the coast in several
weeks, some -holders here dropped prices prac
tically to the basis of the quotation estab
lished by the association. One prominent Job
bing house stated that they would sell at 6%c,
and there were renorts that a quotation as
low as 6c, or %c under the new coast basis,
had been made by another holder. This last
price, however, could not be definitely con
firmed, and It Us understood a certain large
JobtÂ»er would take in a block at that figure.
Â£l>ot stocks of coast seeded are said to be
chiefly in the hands of three holders. Soles of
about 300 boxes of fancy seeded are reported to
have been made on Monday at 7%@7%c.
"The buying of apricots in this market last
week, it la Uarned, was practically all by a
large local jobber. The purchases by this
house, which are reported to be in the neigh
borhood of eight cars, are generally regarded
in the nature of speculation, though the buyer
states that the goods were bought for his regu
lar trade. ?.n important part of which is ex
port in character. Most of the goods bought
were extra choice to fancy stock, and the
buver is still looking around for more goods
at low prices. Many holders are firmer in their
ideas, tome having advanced prices as much
as a cent. Others will sell at about the same
prices they have been quoting right along.
â¢â¢Arrivals of prunes continue light and prices
are firm. Demand, however, is not par
ticularly active at present. Currants are lower,
with prices in buyers' favor. Consumption of
this article is slow. Trade in figs is cood, and
the market is slightly firmer. Demand for
lower grades is particularly active, and layers
of s-ood 6ound quality at 6c are likely to be
6carce soon, it is reported. Fancy, from &c up,
are in very limited supply also. Dates are in
<juite good demand. Apples are very quiet and
unchanged."
the day. Speculative sentiment, however, is
not free from misgivings over the future of the
money market. It is to be borne in mind that
the lending In New York for account of West
ern banks which has been a feature for sev
eral days past' is effected' by drawing upon
the New York deposits of those banks. The
result is to give the benefit of the higher in
terest rate to the Western banks rather than
to the New York banks, but lt is simply by a
transfer of account which does not . afford
relief to the money market The high money
rate here, however, has checked the interior
demand for cash, and the rise in the New York
exchange rate at Chicago to par suggests the
imminence of the return flow to New York.
The unsettled condition of the London money
market pending the budget statement in Par
liament which is fixed for April 18, and which
is awaited for light on the amounts and terms
of the new issue of consols, is an influence
upon money lenders in New York, and, in fact,
all other money centers. Estimates of the
amount of the loan vary from $250,000,000 to
$300,000,000. But in any event the likelihood is
presented of periodical monthly calls upon the
London money market for the next twelve
months for from $10,000,000 to $12,300,000.
The bond market was strong, Mexican Cen
tral incomes being in notable demand and a
large business transacted in Union Pacific can-
vertible fours. Total sales, par value. $6,690,000.

CLOSING.
The stock market - here was waiting to-day,
business being reduced pending the statement
on Thursday of the budget and the policy of
the Government in raising money by another
war loan or by taxes. The tone was very ir
regular. American shares, although inactive,
were firm on Saturday's bank statement and
the Government's purchase of bonds, both of
which incidents were read rearsurinsly. Ber
lin bought Eries early, giving the list a lead
toward better prices, but when New York
prices came over with the news that Wall
street was dull a sagging movement set In
and lasted up until the close. The favorites
here were Southern Railway preferred, the
Union Pacifies." and on the expectation of a
two per cent dividend on the common Atchi
son â¢ issues. Common shares of the Mexican
Railway spurted on the belief that American
combination in Mexican must eventually in
clude the English roads.

NEW YORK. April 15.â Less than 10 points
variation occurred in cotton prices to-day. The

a turn when May reached $8 04 and July $7 95.

turned to about the final basis of Saturday's

NEW YORK, April 13.â Speculative Interest
in. the metal market was generally withheld.
The market for tin to-day, although denoting
a rise of about 25 points on asked prices with
a firm tone was anything but satisfactory,
th'ere being little or no trading at the ad
vance, which was principally due to the .posi
tive strength in that metal abroad. The close
here was flrni at $25 85@26 25, against the nom
inal close of $26 on Saturday. In London an
advance of Â£1 5s was recorded, making spot'

business executed -at $17 for Lake Superior.

ket closed at $17 for Lake Superior and $16 62%
for casting and electrolytic.

however, a further decline of Is 3d occurred,

while at London quotations went oft 2s 6d,
closing at Â£16.

WITH ABMED FOOTPAD
Seattle Newspaper Artist Beceives
Serious Injuries, but Saves
i His Valuables.
SEATTLE, April 15.â C. A. Bobbett, a
Post-Intelllgencer artist, had a hand-to
hand conflict with a footpad to-night, in
which a bulldog revolver In the hands of
his assailant and a heavy walking stick
used by Bobbett to protect himself played
an imporan t part.
The attempted robbery occurred at 13
o'clock on Madison street, directly' under
the bright glare of an electric arc light.
Notwithstanding the fact that cable cars
and pedestrians are almost continually
passing the spot, the robber fought with
Bobbett until the latter had punished him
terribly over the head with his cane.
Then the robber, realizing that his efforts
were futile, dealt Bobbett two stunning
blows on the head and made his escape
in the darkness.
"My assailant approached mo from be
hind," said Bobbett. "He had thrust tha
muzzle of his revolver against my breast
before I realized his object. The act was
accompanied with the customary com-'
mand, 'Hands up!' I Instantly seized the
revolver and struck at the robbÂ» Â«â¢ with
my . cane. He attempted to wr : bis
weapon from my hand, but I continued
to rain blows on his head. We struggled
for fully a minute and my assailant final
ly wrenched the revolver from my grasp.
He did not desist, however, but contin
ued to strike at me. I returned the blows
with my car.e and I landed two on his
head after his revolver was free. Finally
the robber made a. feint and landed two
blows in quick succession on my head
with the weapon. I became dazed and
sank on my knees to the sidewalk. The
fellow then turned and fled up Summit
avenue.*' :'-"â¢Â¦ â¢
Bobbett appeared In the- .Post-Intelli
gencer office at 11 o'clock, his clothing*
and face covered with the blood flowing
from the wounds, which t consist of two
deep gashes, one in the center of the
forehead, and the other on the crown of
the head. It required a dozen stitches of
the surgeon's needle to draw the flesh to
gether. Bobbett's skull was not frac
tured and his wounds, though painful, are
not of a. serious nature.
SUES FOB A BECOUirr-
OF JUDGESHTP VOTES
SAN BERNARDINO, April 15.â In the
Superior Court this afternoon Benjamin
F. Bledsoe filed a suit for a recount ot all
the votes cast * here at the election last
November for the judiciary. Bledsoe <D.)
and Bennett (R.) each polled the same
number of votes. Since then the incum
fcent, Superior Judge Campbell, has con
tinued in office. Judge Campbell contends
there is no vacancy, as no choice result
ed from the election. Other prominent
members of tho county bar insist that an
appointment should be made, and several
of them have filed petitions with Governor
Gage In an effort to get the position, which
is for six years and worth $4000 per an
num. It is said Governor Gage has sev
eral names under consideration for the
place.
Bledsoe. In his complaint, alleges there
was much illegal voting.. He claims .to
have ample proof that several men whoso
names were not on the great register cast
ballots. Permission was obtained from
Attorney General Ford to-day to com
mence the action. The contestant Is but
26 years old and is a Native Son.

SAN DIEGO, April 15.â Ex-Mayor "Will
iam H. "Carlson, who for the past threÂ«
years has been in the employ of the Gov
ernment, the last year as Commissioner of
Railroads for the Island of Cuba, returned
to San Diego to-day on a short vacation.
Ex-Mayor Carlson was always an en
thusiast on' the subject of building a rail
road from San Diego Bay to Yuma, and
he says that he is now prepared to go
ahead, with backing from three sources,
to build the road If the citizens and City
Council in San Diego will grant to him n.
clear title to the franchise which he ones
owned. He was then stopped from build
ing, by the injunction of the Santa Fe
Railroad, but : he declares that he has
found ample backing to put .the road
through now if he- can get the same sort
of concessions from the city.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 15.â A report
from Apache County saya that Ed Beeler,
former. Sheriff of that county, was am
bushed and killed on the Arizona-New
Mexico boundary line, near Slenega post
office. Cowboys found him dying shortly
after the shooting. Twelve shots were
fired in rapid succession from behind a
stone "fence, and smokeless powder was
employe'd. Th'e Sheriff and a posse are
searching the hills for the fugitives, with
fair chances of overtaking them.
Tho murder was one of the most cold
blooded and deliberate in the history of
Arizona, and the prominence of the vic
tim has instilled double life into the effort
to run down the fugitives. One theory
advanced is that tho ex-Sherifl's murder
ers are members of the gang of cattle
rustlers and murderers who cut a wide
criminal swath through Southern Utah
and Apache County two years ago, wind
ing up their career 'In that county by kill
ing two promirjtni citizens who were
members of a pursuing party.

PROFESSOR. FEEYEE TEULS
OF CHINESE! FEMALE LIFE
"The Influence and Position of Woman
in China" was the subject of an interest
ing lecture delivered last night at the
Academy of Sciences Hall by; Dr. John
Freyer, professor of Oriental languages
and literature of the University of Cali
fornia. â¢ Â¦
Dr. Freyer; spent a number of years, in
the land of Confucius and during the
course of his remarks referred to many
incidents connected with the life of a Chl
neso .female that came under his personal
observation.
"The virtues of women which are ex
tolled in Christian countries receive no
recognition in China," said Professor
Freyer. "The life of a Chinese woman
is one of service. She is not taught to
read or write. When tutors are engaged
to teach the males of well-bred families
the females sometimes .have a chance to
acquire knowledge. Notwithstanding the
disadvantages under which they labor
they sometimes rise above them and in
many cases rule, the husband. Henpecked
husbands are not so scarce In China as
this description would lead one to be
lieve." â¢ '.Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦;
Speaking of the "foot-binding." to
which Chinese women of high rank are
subjected. Dr. Freyer styled the custom a
cr>ing evil. The question of infanticide
was also discussed by the lecturer who
said: ' : â¢
â¢"The Catholic missions have done a
great deal of good in collecting thousands
of female children and bringing them up
In foundling asylums. ' Â¦ , â¢â¢ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
The lecture was largely attended and

DEMANDS THAT THE NEW
COPYISTS BE NOT PAID
Civil Service Commission Notifies
Auditor That Appointments
Are Unlawful.
The Civil Service Commission will make
a determined effort to â¢ prevent the four
new copyists appointed by Recorder God
chaux from receiving any salary. ' At a
meeting last night the commission pre
pared' a communication to be transmitted
to Auditor Wells, In which that official's
attention is called to the alleged unlawful
appointment of the four additional copy
ists, "who were not certified by the com
mission fr.om the eligible list. The
ground for the request is that the recent
decision of the Supreme Court relates
only to deputies in the so-called county of
fices. â¢ The. communication says:
The majority opinion of the Supreme Court
states" that the only Question presented In the
case is whether the city and county â¢ of San
I'rancisco can through its Civil . Service Com
ir.ission prescribe the qualifications of deputies
of certain county officers. They alone- are In
volved and a. "copyist", cannot legally or
logically be held to be a deputy. The appoint
ment' of the aforesaid copyists by the Recorder
is in violation i of the civil service provisions
of the charter and we ask that you decline to
audit their demands.
: President Freud states that should the
Auditor refuse to comply with the request
the Treasurer will be asked to refuse pay
merit. on T . the 'salary demands. : If the
Treasurer declines to so act the matter
will be taken to. court to determine - if
copyists are exempted from the civil ser
vice clause in the charter. When God
chaux appointed the four, additional copy
ists Auditor Wells assured him that their
demands would be audited by him, and, as
the Treasurer -always j honors demands
signed by. the Auditor, it looks as if the
commission must seek relief in the courts.

This. Is the 'first that has been heard of

NEW SCHEDUXE OF PRICES
Sunday and Holiday Snavers Will

Fully eight hundred members of the
Journeymen Barbers' Union attended a
meeting in the Shiels building last night
and cheered the various sentiments of the
members who gained the "floor and ad
dressed the assemblage.
The efforts of Manuel Azevade to have
his name placed on the roll as a journey
man barber precipitated a debate that
lasted for several hours. He had been
admitted to membership at a previous
meeting, but developments proved that he
had not served a sufficient length of time
in mastering the art. of shaving and hair
cutting to make him eligible as a journey
man. The members of the union took the
stand that their rules were made for the
purpose of preventing an abuse of jour
neymen barbers' privileges Â«jid .as a result
the name of Mr. Azevade was dropped
from the membership roll and added to
the list of apprentices.
J. J. Calish presented a resolution bear
ing Â¦ the signatures of 500 bosses, which
provided for the raising of the price of a
shave to 15 cents on all' days other than
Sundays and holidays. Twenty-five cents
-was named as the price to be charged on
the last named days. Â¦
The resolution further provided that the
raise in prices should go Into effect
Wednesday. May 1. 1901.
A partial report -submitted by Secretary
Currier showed that the picnic given by
the union at Germania Gardens last Sun
day was decidedly successful.
The salary of Secretary Less was placed

given as the reason for the increase.

Possibility That All Employes in
Branches of United States Steel
Corporation Will Save
, aPart.
PITTSBURG. April 15.â As a result of
the 'dispute that for a week past has in
volved the employes of the W. Dewee'a
wood plant of the American- Sheet Steel
Company at McKeesport, about half of
the men are on strike- to-day and the
operation of the plant is' badly crippled.
The cause of the trouble was the recent
discharge of. seven men, who," the- men
claim,' were dismissed because they were
members of the newly- organize^ lodge of
the Amalgamated Association.. .
The strike was ordered at a meeting of
the local lodge ye3ierday . afternoon and
went into effect at 1 o'clock this morning.
All is quiet about the works to-day. None
of the discontented workmen are loitering
about the mill and there is- no prospect
of trouble. The members of the firm say
that they will continue the operation of
their plants and that if they are troubled
by the strikers at McKeesporÂ£' they will
ship their material elsewhere for. manu
facture. The mill employs about 800 men
and about half of them are now out.
The event is looked upon as momentous
throughout the iron and steel trade of- the
country, from the fact that it is the first
conflict between organized labor and the
new United States Steel Corporation- and
because of . the announced i intention to
day'of President TV J. Shaffer, the head
of the Amalgamated Association of Iron,
Steel and Tin Workers, to tie up every
plant of the new combineâ steel, tin, tube,
structural iron/ wire and all â if necessary
to win the fight. - :
.As to the chance that tho men in all
the mills of. the United States Steel Cor
poration will be called- on to come out no
one connected with- the management of
any of the organized plants in the new
corporation will consent to be quoted. The
only underlying companies in the new
corporation whose- mills 'are entirely in
dependent of the Amalgamated Associa
tion are the Carnegie interests and tho
National Tube Company. The mills of the
American Steel Hoop Company, the
American Tin Plate Company and the
Republic Iron and Steel Company are all
organized, while most of those of the
American Sheet Steel Company and the
National Steel Company and a few of the
National Steel, American Steel and Wire
and American Bridge plants work under
the Amalgamated Association. Most of
the American -Steel and Wire plants are
controlled by the rod mill men. . . â¢

men to represent the Prudential in all
parts of this State and "Washington. For

From a synopsis of the twenty-fifth an
nual statement of the Prudential Insur
ance Company of America, which com
pany has recently commenced operations
In California and "Washington, It is shown
that this progressive institution made
large gains during 1900. Figures regard
ing such a life insurance company are al
ways interesting to note, and -it is safe
to eay that no one will be more Interested
in the company's prosperity than Its 4,000,
000 policy-holders. The policies of the
Prudential are issued upon the most mod
ern and improved plans that can be de
vised by life " underwriters. " During the
twenty-five > years of. its existence the
Prudential has paid to its policy-holders
over $49,000,000. Of this amount it â¢ paid
over $7,000,000 to beneficiaries during- last
vear. At the end of 1900 the -company's
assets were over $40,000,000, while it had
over 5604,000,000 of insurance in.force. The
surplus at theend of 1900 was over $6,000, -
000. One of the sure tests of a life in
surance company's prosperity is its. in
come, the Prudential's record in this par
ticular for 1900 being over $24,000,000. "While
many other figures are shown in a more
detailed statement of -the company's an
nual report, those given above reflect with
particular credit upon the management of
this great institution.
A letter addressed to the president of the
company, Mr. John F. Dryden, Home Of
fice, Newark, N. J.. or to their local repre
sentatives In California or "Washington
will bring any information you may desire
with reference to the policies issued by
the Prudential.

. During the past few nights several be
lated citizens have been held up and
robbed by the same man. Last night i a
number of policemen dressed In citizens'
clothes patrolled the streets in the "West
ern Addition in the hope of catching the
footpad, but they failed to get a trace of
him.
'Guggenheim described the robber as be
ing about 5 feet 10 inches in height and
weighing about 170 pounds. He wore a
slouch hat and a. dark suit of clothes. '
"I had just left my brother's house," he
said when telling his story to, the police,
"when the robber, who wore a mask, sud
denly confronted me and" placing a re
volver In proximity to my. head,, or
dered me to throw up my hands. As I
did so he placed his disengaged hand in
my pocket and helped himself to a small
amount of money.;. Determined to save
my jewelry If possible, I yelled for help.
At that the footpad, with an oath, took
to his heels and disappeared down Gough
street." / .
A lone robber Is operating in the "West
ern Addition. Late Sunday night he held
up J. D. Guggenheim on Gough street, but

in which it was held that a Chinese person
being denied a landing at the port of San
Francisco might be taken to Mexico or
any other foreign port selected by tue
Chinese. , . , J- Â¦ . .
The recent ruling was probably brought
about by the experience of Federal of
ficials in San Diego three weeks^ ago.
Fifty-two Chinese were landed at that
port and James K. Dunn. Chief of the Chi
nese Bureau, went to San Diego with a
staff of stenographers and interpreters to
hear the applications to land. The result
of the inquiry was that two were landed
and fifty denied. These fifty, under- the
departmental ruling, were allowed to be
taken to Ensenada, Lower California,
from which place, it was subsequently
learned, they had made their way across
the Mexican border into California.

The arrest of Julia Gonzalerkl and

j?lven considerable satisfaction to the
Police' Department here. Th*>. woman
and the man have been apparently work
ing together to plunder houses where the
woman was employed. Mrs. Catherine
Espinoza". 2400 Harrison street, engaged
the woman on March a as a domestic,
and on March 21 while the family wad
temporarily absent, she absconded with
510<W worth of jewelry. 'The police wcrd
notified, but nothing was heard of tin

ENGINEER HERLIHY
LOSES ON APPEAL
Judge Morrow Decides That He Must
Take His Case Before Captain
Bermingham.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow de
cided yesterday that his court had no
power to interfere with the judgment of
Captains O. F. Bolles and J. K. Bulger.
United States Inspectors of Local and
Foreign Steam Vessels, in revoking the
license of P. H. Herlihy, formerly chief
engineer of the Rio de Janeiro.
During the investigation by the inspec
tors into the matter of the wreck of the
Rio de Janeiro. Engineer Herlihy's own
testimony proved to the satisfaction of the
inspectors that he had been guilty of
neglect of duty and they revoked his li
cense. From the decision of the inspec
tors an appeal may be tatcen to Supervis
ing Inspector Captain John Bermingham,
but Herlihy. instead of taking that course,
hired a lawyer and appealed to the United
States Circuit Court. First Assistant
United States District Attorney Banning
appeared for the inspectors and interposed
a demurrer on the ground that Herlihy
had an adequate remedy at law by taking
an appeal to the Supervising Inspector.
Herlihy, in his appeal, alleged that Su
pervising Inspector Bermingham was
prejudiced against him, because Captain
Bermingham had signed and approved the
Judgment of the inspectors. The matter
â¢was argued before the court by Mr. Ban
ning and Harry W. Hutton and at the
close of the argument Judge Morrow sus
tained the demurrer and dismissed the ap
peal.

The purpose of the simple plan of greet
ing the distinguished comrade is to make
the visit agreeable and restful to him
from his point of view. It is well known
that he views the i;rogramme of San
Francisco functions as something that
may impose a. jrreat tax on his time and
strength. Appreciating his desire for rest
and recreation during his outing, his com
rades of the Grand Army have resolved
to make it easv for him.
The Grand Army posts have also de
cided to make it easy for the public, as
the chairman of the citizens' executive
committee has been informed that the
posts of the city will supply all the funds
needed to carry out the plans adopted by
the veterans for the entertainment of the
President.
It is no longer a secret of the order that
every post of San Francisco is gifted with
orators cf rare fluency. As any post, sin
gle handed, can present a formidable col
umn of talkers, one can fancy what the
President will bump up against when he
joins a meeting composed of all the posts
of the G. A. K. in San Francisco.
The President, as a member of the or
der, will be advised of a post meeting in
the city and if he fet-ls inclined to join
his comrades in the simple, ordinary fash
inn of fraternal assembly he will go to
the hall, give the national countersign and
ask for admission, lie will be announced
as Comrade William McKinley, Post 60,
Canton. Ohio, a visitor in the city. No
doubt he will be able to convince the com
mittee appointed to inspect his creden
tials that he is a comrade in good stand
ing who wants to get "on the inside. '
Without undue ceremony, the greeting ac
corded to visiting comrades v:ill be ex
tended to him by the post - commander.
If the jrer.eral talk of the session inclines
him to join in the talking, he will find in
terested listeners.
Some evening during the Presidential so
jcurn in San Francisco a meeting of the
post will take place, perhaps at Native
Sons' Hall. The hull will be equipped to
meet the recuirements of a post meeting.
At the time appointed for the meeting
the pest will be called to order in th>i
usuai form, and even* comrade of the
Grand Army in good standing will be ad
mitted, provided he gives the countersign.
A committee representing the Grand
Army posts of San Francisco has devised
a simr>ie but Interesting method of ex
tending a fraternal greeting to President
McKinley. According to this plan George
M". Mott, department commander, will be
requested to erant official permission for
the creation of a provisional post, consist
ing of Lincoln. Thomas, Garfield. Mcade,
Cass and Liberty posts of Â£an Francisco.
The provisional post so established will
elect a commander and other officers.
No Parade or Extra Ceremony Pro
videdâPresident Will Simply !
Give the Countersign and
Go Inside.

Is Expected to Attend
a Post Meeting.
PLANS ADOPTED
BY GRAND ARMY
of Charles Pratt, 3S years old, single, a
ship carpenter, who died yesterday at the
City and County Hospital after." being
operated on. for a fracture of the skull,
inflicted, acording to a statement made by
Pratt last week, by footpads on the night
of April 6. -..
On, the night In question Pratt was
found at the corner of Third and Natoma
streets by Police Officers Clark and Orr."
He was under the Influence of liquor and
was taken to the Emergency Hospital for
treatment. Drs. McElroy and Boscovitch
found that Pratt had a lacerated scalp
wound, but no signs were present of a
fracture of the skull. The wound was
treated and Pratt was locked up in the
Southern police station. The next day
he was set" at libert".
Pratt lived at 657 Howard street and his
landlady, Mrs. J. E. Langille, noticed that
her lodger was a sick man when he re
turned home on April 7. Pratt informed
her that he had been held up and robbed
by four men on the' previous night and
after being knocked on the head was
robbed of his watch and chain. Pratt
grew worse and last Thursday was unablo
to leave his bed. - On Saturday he became
unconscious and wds removed to the City
and County Hospital. He showed all
symptoms of a fractured skull and yester
day morning was operated upon by Drs.
Morton and Dodsworth.
On the left side of the head, directly be
neath the scalp wound, the doctors dis
covered that there was a fracture of the
inner plate of the skull, tne outer plate
being intact. The skull was trephined
and Pratt was removed to a ward, A few
hours after the operation the patient died
and his body was removed to the Morgue.
Drs. -McElroy and Boscovitch said last
evening that they had taken every pre
caution to discover if Pratt had. a frac
ture of the skull when he was brought to
the Emergency Hospital. They declared
that absolutely no clinical signs of frac
ture were observed and they discharged
the man from the hospital after treating
the laceration. â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ -. â¢ " , '.
Dr. ' Morton went to Sacramento last
evening aijd Dr. Dodsworth declined to
give any information on the; subject.
"The case is in the hands of the Cor
oner," said Dr. â¢ Dodsworth, "and I don't
propose to give my opinion as to the
cause of Pratt's death. The man did not
die en the operating table as reported;
he died some hours after the operation."
-Dr. rBacigalupi, autopsy surgeon to
Coroner Leland. held an autopsy on tin*
body of Pratt last night. The result of
the examination showed that Pratt died ,
from intercerebral hemorrhage, caused by
a blow on the head, and that the shock
following the operation performed at the
City and County Hospital was a contribu
tory cause.
Dr. Bacigalupi stated that It was impos
sible for him to tell whether Pratt had
sustained injury by a fall .or from a
weapon. The evidenee was destroyed by
the operation at the hospital, when two
large pieces of Pratt's skull were remove!
by trephining. . ,
The positive statement of the doctors
at the hospital that Pratt had a fractu'o
of the inner plate of the skull was proven
errdneous by the. autopsy. Dr. Baciga
lupi was surprised to find that Pratt's
skull had been trephined on the right and \
left sides,' the pieces of skull removed be
inf as large as half a dollar.
"Just why the skull was trephined on
both . sides,'! said tne autopsy surgeon,
"I -am at Â¦ a loss to* understand. The
symptoms of pressure on the brain, fol
lowing an injury to the skull, are such
that it is possible to determine exactjy
the seat of trouble." Coroner Leland wul
hold ' an inquest and the doctors of the
City Hospital, who operated on Prat*,
will be called upon to testify.
