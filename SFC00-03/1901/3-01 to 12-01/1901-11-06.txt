SCHMITZ WINS BY A SAFE PLURALITY OVER WELLS

Union Labor Candi
date Runs Well in
All Districts.
AT the hour of going to press thÂ«
semi-official election returns Indi
cate the election of Eugene E.
Schmitz, the Union Labor candi
date, as Mayor of Ban Francisco.
The returns up to 2 o'clock gave
Bchmiti a lead of some 2300 votes over
"We Is, and it Is beyond question that he
will maintain his lead with little variation |
to thÂ« end of the count.
The election of the standard-bearer of
the Union Labor party to the responsible
position of Mayor of a municipality such
es this Is due to the operations of Herrin,
Kelly, Burns, Burke, Lynch and the Re
publican push who sought to cram a set
of candidates down the throats of the peo
ple without regard for their fitness for
the public service.
The Republican ticket was made up of
men who were pledged In advance
to carry out the behests of the
bosses If elected and the people
would not have it. At the time thi6
ticket was nominated the Democratic
party was divided and the success of the
Republican party was assured provided
capable men were placed in nomination.
Instead of doing this the bosses selected
â¢ men whom even Wells was forced, to re
pudiate, and when this became a matter
of public comment self-respecting Repub
licans cast their votes for Tobin in the
vali hope that by thus combining the
Â«leÂ«tion of Schmltr might be defeated.
Bui: the effort failed.
The defection of the Republicans was
the very means by which the election of
a class ticket was accomplished. What
ever the results may be to Ban Francisco
by reason of this radical departure from
established precedents, Herrin and his fol
lowing of bosses must accept the responsi
bility therefor. The repudiation by the
popular votÂ« of the Herrln-Kelly tainted
ticket will be a repudiation of this gentry
for all time.
Nearly all of the candidates for the
minor offices advocated by ThÂ© Call were
elected. Almost the entire present Board
of Supervisors Is re-elected. Members of
all- parties rallied to the support of the
present members of the board, whose offi
cial reoord during their term of office was
untainted by a single scandal.. The elec
tion of Lane for City Attorney, Lackmann
for Sheriff, Leland for Coroner and Farn
hara for Public Administrator is certain.
" Th* total vote, It Is estimated, will reach
16,000.

LIBERAL
POLICY
Mayor-Elect Will
Recognize No
Class.
Regards His Election
as a Rebuke to
the Bosses.
AT his comfortable and attractive
home on Fillmore street, near
Green, Eugene E. Schmits last
night outlined the policy of hi 3
administration. A survey of the
return* at hand had convinced
him of bis election to thÂ« office of Mayor
and he spoke frankly of his plans for the
management of municipal affairs. He de
sired to remind the people of San Fran
cisco through the columns of The Call
that he did not entertain radical or revo
lutionary sentiments and that he would
be guided by a purpose to give the city
an extremely conservative administra
tion. He remarked:
"I believe that one result of ray elec
tion will be the establishment of more
friendly relations between the employers
and employes and I will endeavor to
bring about a feeling of harmony :n this
line, believing that it will conduce to the
welfare of San Francisco. I shall give fair
consideration to invested capital. I said
to the convention of the Union Labor
party before I was nominated : 'I am con
servative in my ideas and am not In fa
vor of a radical revolutionary policy, my
motto being equal rights for all men. spe
cial privileges to none. I am in Savor of
peaceful measures at all hazards between,
employers and employes and deplore all
resort to violence in the settlement of any
differences.'
"I spoke to the committee frankly be
fore the delegates gave me the nomina
tion, and now. after my election. I assure
the people of the city that It wtll be my
aim in offlte to do everything in my powoy
to honor San Francisco and promote thu
prosperity of the city.
Fair Representation.
"As San Francisco is my birthplace,
and as my father came here in 1349 an
actively devoted himself to the building
up of the city, it will surely be my desira
to make a most creditable administration.
All classes and all elements will have Junt
and fair representation in the commis
sions to be appointed by the Mayor. I wiM
consult the best interests of the city in
making changes, and will fully respect
the non-partisan spirit of the charter.
"The Union Labor party did not exact
a pledge of me. All that the delegates
asked of me was fairness and equs.l
rights. I have made no pledges, and
therefore am in position to exercise my
own judgment in the important duty of
appointments to the various, commissions.
Since you ask the direct question, I w:!l
answer frankly that I will make some
changes, but will exercise great care -n
the selection of men."
When requested to give hi 3 opinion as
, to the chief significance o* his election,
Mr. Schmitz said:
"While my election is a victory for the
Union tabor party, it is also a great vic
â¢ tory for independent anti-boss Republi
cans. I am a Republican, and If partita
swing back -to their natural position I
will be found in the Republican camp. I
regard my election as a just and over
whelming rebuke to bossiam. The Re
publican candidate derived his nomination
from a convention dictated to and con
trolled by Herrin and other bosses. The
Democratic candidate was nominated by
a convention representing Phelan and
McNab. Independent Republicans and
Democrats, as a .protest against boss n
nipulation, cast their votes for me. Un
doubtedly my election is a rebuke to tho
bosses.
Proud of His Support.

licans, I am glad to say, voted for me, as
indicated by the vote I received la the

BATTLE OF THE BALLOTS ATTENDED BY LITTLE EXCITEMENT AROUND BOOTHS
AND CHARACTERIZED BY THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ANY SERIOUS DISORDER
LIGHT VOTE CAUSES
GUESSING AT NOON
Election Officers Suffer Ennui During Most
of the Day, but Late-Comers Bring Total
Up to Numbers Estimated by Experts
Varying Reports From Different Sections Keep
Hope of Candidates' Partisans Alive Un
til Long After the Beginning of the Count
A MORE quiet, uneventful elec
tion day could not have been
made to order. From the time
the polls opened until they were
closed at 5 o'clock there was lit
tle excitement anywhere and
few attempts at interference
with the legal procedure or with indi
vidual rights.
In the outlying and north of Market
districts there was a rush to the booths
in the early morning and then a lull.
South of Market street there was a re
markably light vote polled in the fore
noon and at noon the report of the Reg
istrar that a total of but 29.554 votes had
been cast led many to the conclusion that
a singular apathy existed and that the
total vote would fall much below the esti
mated numbers.
In the afternoon, however, the scenes
around the South of Market booths
livened up and after 4 o'clock voting was
livelier in the Western Addition and Mis
sion districts. As a result the total vote
easily reached the estimate's made by
those best qualified to figure on the prob
lem.
At Union. Labor Headquarters.
The condition of affairs in the various
polling places south of Market street,
where it was expected Schmitz would poll
practically a unanimous vote, was the
subject of serious comment early in the
afternoon among those gathered at the
Union Labor headquarters. The great
falling off in the vote in all parts of the
city was regarded by the Schmltz sup
porters as a hopeful sign as far as the
chances of their champion was concerned.
The day was a quiet one, but the Union
Labor party managers did not relax their
vigilance on that- account. Reports were
received from union watchers .south of
Market street that attempts would be
made to count Schmitz out in certain pre
cincts. The Labor watchers were in
structed to notify headquarters at once
should such attempts be made while the
count was in progress. A large force of
union men was in attendance at head
quarters all day in readiness for any ser
vice that might be required of them.
In the first precinct of the Twenty
ninth district several of the Rainey crowd
took charge of the polls and far some
hours intimidated every one whom they
suspected to be Schmltz voters. When
this fapt was made known at headquar
ters. Secretary Parry dispatched ten men
to the scene with Instructions -to give the
Rainey men "all they wanted in the way
of trouble if they were looking for it."
There was little trouble experienced in
ridding the booth of the objectionable ele
ment, so that order was the rule for the
remainder of the day.
The decreased vote caused considerable
speculation among union men as to the
outcome. While all pretended that the re
turns would be satisfactory, there was,
nevertheless, a gloomy spirit manifested
by many. The failure to secure a heavy
vote in districts where the union men
talked loudest during the campaign con
vinced the most ardent Schmitz man that
there was treachery somewhere in the
ranks of union labor. The only, grata of
comfort to be gathered from the reports
received during the afternoon was the fact
that the vote in all parts of the city was
comparatively light. It was argued from
this that Schmitz'* chances for election
were increased thereby, as it was claimed
that many Republican votes were being
polled for Tobin. â¢
. Out in the Western Addition the general
relief was that everything was going for
Wells. In the Forty-first, Wells' own dis
trict, it was said that the Republican can
didate was holding all his party strength
and the vote was heavy "on the hill,"
while in "Cow Hollow," the Democratic
end of th district, there were more
Schmitz than Tobin votes being cast.
Throughout the Western Addition there
was the utmost order around the booths
a quiet almost like that of Sunday prevail!

Money Used in the Forty-Third.
With the exception of a wordy dispute
between two opium fiends the election in
the Tenderloin district passed off without
the least trouble. Wells workers were at
the polls as soon as the voting commenced
and remained until the last ballot had
been cast. Money was freely used by
th* different factions. One of Wells' work

ers openly declared that he had been
given $1000 to influence voters to cast their
ballot for the Republican standard
bearer.
At the polling place on Grant avenue,
between Sutter and Bush streets, a crowd
of Tenderloin habitues who were out for

fluence voters in favor of the Republican
candidate. Their operations became so
brazen that the police were forced to
drive-them away.

of Ellis and Powell streets. Both claimed
that the Tenderloin district would roll
up a handsome majority for the entire
Republican ticket. ,

carefully watched the voting, expecting
that the Flsk workers would attempt to

and between Twelfth Btreet and the wat

The election officers had so little to do
early in the day that they sunned them
selves in front of booths between votes.
Most of the afternoon was spent In guess
ing as to the results.
Joseph S. Tobin went to the polls about
10 o'clock, his voting booth being in the
rear of the Palace Hotel, in front of tne
army headquarters on New Montgomery
street. He was the sixty-third voter. He
stood the ordeal of the snapshot fiends
without flinching and marked his ticket
from top to bottom. His friends cheered
him as he left the booth.
In none of the precincts of this portion
of the city did any of the election or po
lice officers have any trouble in preserving
the peace. The districts where trouble
usually occurs were as quiet as on a Sun
day.
There was little in the Mission to indi

TEST OF ITEW PROCESS
FOR SMELTING ORES
California Company Hopes to Revolu
tionize the Methods That Aire
Now in Use.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. s.â The plans of the
California Iron Company for the first
demonstration that the Trapp heating,
roasting and smelting furnace can turn
out pig iron from the ore in much shorter
time and at a much less expense than by
old processes are about completed. The
demonstration will be made on 100 tons of
ore from the Tepustete mines of Lower
California within two weeks.
The company has been incorporated in
Phoenix with a capital of $1,000,000, but
San Diego is given as its place of busi
ness. It is proposed to handle iron, cop
per, gold and silver ores â in fact, any ore
that has to be smelted. I For the furnace
it is claimed that with a plant costing
only one-tenth of what present smelters
cobt the smelting can be done at little
more than BO per cent of the present cost
of turning out the metal from the ore.
The one furnace now erected has a ca
pacity of about forty tons a day, and the
size of the njant can be increased simply
by increasing the number of similar fur*
races. The money is behind the com
pany for the erection of a large plant as
soon as the practicability of this first fur
r.ace is demonstrated.

of a few of the adherents of the candi

one, there being no disturbance of any sort
in any of the districts occupying that por

At every voting precinct in the Thirty
fourth, Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth dis

number of voters gathered at the polls
and voted, and from this time until the
polls closed at 5 o'clock the boou.s were
never crowded. The number of ballots
cast in the Mission districts did not equal
the numbers party leadere predicted.
Unusual quiet marked the passing of the
day in the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth

"Although I have been attacked severe
ly and unjustly, I bear no malice toward
my detractors. I have no political or per

The Mayor-elect said last evening that
he would leave the city in a few days for
two weeks' quiet sojourn in the country.
He prefers not to take the public into his
confidence regarding: the place of resort he
has in mind. He feels that he is entitled
to a rest and intends to take it on the
quiet.
Joseph S. Tobin said in an Interview
last evening when he was informed that
Mr Schmitz was elected Mayor:

the good judgment of the people. The is

When the count was commenced in the
Thirteenth Precinct of the Thirty-ninth
District an effort was made to rush it
through by tallying off a number of bal
lots at once. This confused the clerks and
after the count had progressed for about
an hour there were many serious dis
crepancies in the tally sheets.
A recount was commenced, but for some
reason the old difficulty again presented
itself. After a third attempt the mistakes
were rectified.

SANTA ROSA, Nov. 6.â The Tordl will
contest came to a close her* this evening
when the Jury found a verdict upholding
the will and deciding against the propon
ent, Mrs. x Sarah J. Yordi. The Jury was
out but fifteen minutes. The . verdict was
brief and was to the effect that the will
of December 24, 1900. was not executed by
the deceased by reason of undue influence
The contest was over a will left by the

Chapelle Is Complimented.
ROME. Nov. 6.â The Voce Delia Verita
the organ of the Vatican, publishes a let
ter dated October 28. from the Pope to
Mgr. Chapelle. in which His Holiness re-
Jo^ at the excellent manner in which
in spite of the difficulties encountered'
Mgr. Chapelle has accomplished his ml*
son in. the Philippines, and highly â¢m"
EoÂ£L him UP Â° the results of his la"!
The Fanfulla announces that Mer Sbar
ettl, having been appointed apostolic de\"
egate to the Philippines, Mgr Chapelle"
will now resume the bishopric* of New Or
a beer glass. The warm belt of the Mis
sion became as hot a* a glass retort and
even the chilly precincts of thÂ© Potrero
and South San Francisco were surcharged
with a torrid atmosphere that obviated
the necessity of side-stepping the bay
breezes to keep warm.
It was certainly a memorable election
day. Out in the Thirty-nrst "Lefty"
Bannon managed to slide through the day
without being "pinched" for voting dead
men, and down in the Twenty-eight "Split
Lip" Collin3 succeeded in doing his an
nual election stunt without getting a black
eye.
Warrant Clerk Johnnie Greeley was
called away from the booth on Second and
Bryant streets several times to get con
stituents out of jail for violating the 100
foot regulation and Larry Conlon spent
his time driving hackloads of challenged
voters out to the Registrar's office.
Sam Rainey held down his usual seat in
the Bush-street stables and nearly had an
attack of heart failure when the fire bell
rang about 4 o'clock.
Henry â¢ Gallagher. Harry Brennan and
"Hot Air" Kelly drove down to the elec-,
tion booth on Harrison street, near
Fourth, about 4 o'clock in the morning |
and waited there until the polls opened
BO they could vote for Tobin before the
teamsters from, the Overland barn got out
of the stable.
In the Thirty-second a labor agitator
spoiled a ballot. One of the Inspectors
opened it up and found a cross behind the
name of every Democratic candidate from
the Mayor down to Police Judge.
A son of Erin stood outside an election
booth on Brannan street declaring his
principles to a crowd.
"Faith an' I'm .a Schmitz man," he
yelled at the too of his voice. "Sure, an"
he's wun iv our own kind iv people. Ha
hez a Ditch name, but his mother wuz a
Clare woman an' phawt is the loikes of
me doin' wid th' loiks iv Joe Tobin an'
hiz red coat, anyway." When he came
out of the booth one of the bystanders
asked him if he had voted for Schmitz.
"You kin bet yu're hod agin a clay
poipe I did," he said. "I put me little
chross behint th' name iv both Wells an'
Tobin!"
Eddie Graney had an opportunity to
blow off steam. Eddie spends his time
between elections listening. He is known
as the best listener in politics. Graney
will listen to any kind of political guff
fro^n the time-worn story of how Boas
Higgins used to manage things down to
the details of how Captain Crowe and Jim
O'Brien did the funeral stunt that mada
them political powers in the Thirty-first.
Yesterday Graney went from one booth,
to the other in the Thirty-eighth giving*
up his yearly horde of political gossip.
When the news that Schmitz was elect
ed spread through the south side last
night there was a general scramble to the
corner grocery stores. The proverbial can
worked overtime, and the ifs and the
ands and the whys and the wherefores
of the campaign were forgotten in the
inauguration of a session of jollification
that is quite likely to last a week.
FATE OF CORONADO
IN A JURY'S HANDS
Twelve Men Trying the Alleged Mur
derer Are Locked Up for
the Night.
SAN JOSE, Nov. s.â The fate of Nol
berto Coronado, charged with the murder
of Frank Narona at Almaden on July 28
last, is in the hands of a jury to-night.
Attorney W. A. Bowden finished his ar- I
gument for the defense this morning, and
District Attorney Campbell closed for the
people at 3 o'clock this afternoon. Judge
Lorigan then charged the Jury, which re
tired shortly before 4 o'clock to deliberate
upon a verdict. At 9:30 o'clock to-night
the jury had not agreed and was locked
up for the night.
The evidence against Coronado Is purely
circumstantial, but the prosecution has
made out a strong case against him. A
feature of the trial was the testimony of
eO Si Spesser, the convicted murderer*
i. Â° n * r ff Farley of Monterey County,
who claimed Coronado had confessed to
him.

CELEBRATED LOOP OF THE WARSHIP BROOKLYN
A THEME IN ARGUMENT AT COURT OF INQUIRY
WASHINGTON, Nov. s.â The
time of the Schley court of
inquiry was devoted to-day to
hearing argument in the case
of Admiral Schley. Hanna
finished his argument in behalf of the
department, which had been begun yes
terday, and Captain James Parker began
but did not conclude his presentation of
the case for Admiral Schley.
Hanna to-day considered the retrograde
movement, the bombardment of the Colon,
the famous loop and the charge made
against Admiral Schley of disobedience of
orders. He had only reached the coaling
question when the court adjourned. Cap
tain Parker will conclude his speech to
morrow, when Mr. Raynor will begin.

INFLAMMATION
THE CAUSE OF NEARLY ALL SUFFERING
Dr. Halpruner's Wonderful Medicine Will Remove In-
flammation From the Body, No Matter in Which
Part It Is Located, Whether It Be in the Feet, the
Lungs, the Throat, the Head or the Hands. It's a Re-
markable Remedy.
The original meaning of the word "in-
flammation" Is to set on lire, to inflame.
Inflammation in the body is practically
the same as fire in the nouse â it means
that some part of your body is on lire â
the parts are ltd, inflamed, and general-
ly in pain.
For instance, catarrh in the head is in-
flammation of the mucuous membranes of
the nasal passages; sore throat is simply
inflammation in the throat; if you bruise
your linger with a hammer, inflammation
is immediately caused; if you have swol-
len, aching feet, you have Innammation
in the feet; if you have a cold in the head,
it is Inflammation, and a medicine that
will remove inflammation will cure your
complaint.
Halpruner's Wonderful Medicine is pre-
scribed and compound*! and put up to
rid the body of inflammation; it puts ouc
the inflammation, just the same as waiei
puts out the flames of tire. It is a medi-
cine that acts on the blood, the pores of
the skin and upon the whole system, giv-
ing it the strength and vigor sufficient to
assist it to work off and work out the in-
flammation, stopping the pain and curing
the disease.
Dr Halpruner spent many years of his
life studying the cause and cure for in-
flammation. He compounded his W onder-
ful Medicine to act upon the cause of dis-
ease and to remove that cause, and there-
fore cure the disease.
But it is not a medicine that will do any
one any harm, because it is made only
from vegetable matter. It is extracted
from roots, barks, blossoms, gums and
flowersâ it is a medicine practically made
by nature and compounded in such por-
tions as to make a very effective and
quickly curing and instantly relieving
remedy.
"While many medicines have been com-
pounded to do this same thing, few have
been successful, few have been made in
the right manner to bring about a curs
required and desired. -â¢.Â«Â«_*.
That Dr. Halpruner's Wonderful Medi-
cine is an effective cure is proven by th?
thousands of people who have received
beneficial effects from its use. In Dr. Hai-
pruner"6 office there are over 5000 names
of people who have used this medicine
with good results. If any one doubts that
this medicine will do as we claim,
they are at liberty to call at the office and
look over the names and write to any they
choose. We also have hundreds of testi-
monials voluntarily submitted, praising
Dr. Halpruner's Wonderful Medicine.
Cold in the Head.
If you have a cold in the head inhale the
vapor of the medicine for immediate re-
liefâtake a teaspoonful in a glass of
water every two hours for a permanent
cure The most serious cold 6 have been
broken in less than a day by this treat-
ment " Honolulu. June 20, 1893.
Dr Halpruner: Please send me four bot-
tles of your medicine, $5. a bottle. I find it
plendid for colds and give it to all my
friends, and they alMike^t.^ rogTER
Catarrh.
Catarrh in the head is a perpetual cold
in the head, but Halpruner's Wonderful
Medicine will cure it if taken consclen-^
tlously and continuously. Most cases of
catarrh are of long standing and requitu
persistent treatment.
I have been afflicted with chronic catarrh
for many years. I have traveled all over
Europe. AEla and Africa. I have taken
many remedies and without avail, but since
I have taken Halpruner' s Wonderful Medi-
cine as prescribed I feel in good condition.-
My catarrh has entirely disappeared and

Rheumatism.
No matter how severe is your case, Hal-
pruner's Wonderful Medicine will give
you immediate relief and remove the
cause of your trouble. There never was v
medicine so well compounded and pre-
scribed to cure rheumatism as Halprun-
er's Wonderful Medicine. It is a wonder-
fully penetrating medicine, and once ap-
plied to the afflicted parts will remove
the pain, giving you the relief you ought
to have. If you will take it internally, as
directed, it will soon remove the cause
and free you from this annoying, painfui
complaint.
I have suffered with rheumatic pains for
some time and after having received a com-
pound fracture of the \eg suffered consid-
erably. I found Dr. Halpruner' 6 Wonderful
Pain Remover a satisfactory and immediate
cure, and I take great pleasure In recom-
mending it as a perfect family medicine.

Sore Throat.
Bore throat is a complaint that you can-
not permit to get the best of you. Do not
allow it to continue, expecting it to cure
itself. It will not do it. Unless treated
at once, the inflammation will continue to
spread until it affects the bronchial tubes,
and perhaps tho lungs, then you will have
a difficult time to got cured. Apply Hal-
pruner's Wonderful Medicine to the
throat at once, as soon as you feel the
slightest symptoms of soreness. Rub it in
well. It is a wonderfully penetrating
medicine, and enters the pores of the skia
and drives out the inflammation. Tako
a few doses imc-rnally to strengthen an 1
overcome the cause of disease. It oft-;
cures a serious case of sore throat in one
night.

When this disease was attacking the
people of this city some years ago, Hal-

appetite ceases and you begin to get out
of sorts with yourself, get Halpruner's
and take it as directed; take it conscien-
tiously and give it a fair, square trial, and
you will be relieved of the Grippe. The
following letter from a La Grippe sufferer
praises our medicine a great deal more
than we ever could.
Gentlemen: In the interest of those who
are Buffering from colds, neuralgia, la
jn-ippe. I want to say that I have used your
Â¦Wonderful Pain Remover with most excel-
lent results.
I went to New York in October, 1900, and
while there caught a severe attack of la
grippe. After suffeiing for several weeks I
returned to California, believing the change
of climate would cure me. It was a hard
trip out in the train and I suffered more
than ever and arrived in San Francisco a
very sick man. I purchased a- bottle of Hal-
pruner's "Wonderful Pain Remover and In-
haled the vapor of the medicine and also
took it* internally mixed with milk, and be-
gan to improve at once, and within a few
days was entirely cured.
Since that time we keep this wonderful
medicine in our house, for it Is a splendid
family remedy, and use it for most every-
thing. I would not be without a bottle of
Halpruner's Pain Remover.

Neuralgia.
Neuralgia comes quickly â comes by sit-
ting in a draught, riding on the dummies
of street cars, being caught in a shower
and sometimes from nervousness. Hal-
pruner's Wonderful Medicine will give
neuralgia sufferers the Immediate relief
they must have. Rub the medicine on the
afflicted parts, inhale the vapor, that will
give you instant relief; take two tea-
spoonfuls in a glass of water every hour,
and ir. less than two hours your neuralgia
will have disappeared.
Through the solicitation of a friend I was
induced to try a bottle of Dr. Halpruner's
Pain Re-mover and found it a remarkable
curative for rheumatic and neuralgic
pains. MRS. E. F. KING,

Swollen and Chilblain Feet
Lots of people think because Halprun-
er's "Wonderful Medicine is good for rheu-
matism and sore throat it cannot be good
for the feet. As we said in the first part
of this article, inflammation is the caus-
of sore throat, neuralgia, rheumatism and
nearly every other complaint, as well as
swollen and chilblain feet. Halpruner'g
Wonderful Medicine will remove the in-
flammation quickly, and when it does so
the pain and annoyance go with It.

Dr. Halprunerâ Dear Sir: Please give two
$1 bottles of your highly beneficial Rheu-
matic Cure and Patn Remover to my young-
est brother, S. J. llaggetti. We have a boy

chilblains. The other day I applied your

your medicine cured him so quickly. Re-

Removes Pain.
It drives it out of the body, removes the
cause of it and makes sick people wel!,
and is a medicine that should be in every
home for the thousands of little ills thai
come to the members of the household
unexpectedly at all hours of the day and
night. It is a medicine that should be
constantly on hand for Immediate use. It
is splendid for tootchache. headache, ear-
ache, cuts, bruises and burns; for flea
bites, mosquito bites.
Athletes Use It.
Halpruner's is good for a rubdown after
exercising; athletes use it, and, by the
way, those who use it are the ones who
most generally excel in athletic sports. It
makes the muscles supple and gives them
strength. It takes out stiffness and sore-
ness, and gives- the athlete the strength
he needs.
I know positively that Dr. Halpruner's
Wonderful Pain Remover is a medicine of
exceptional merit, for my family has used
it for many years. I would not make this
Ftatpment without a positive, personal
knowledge whereof I speak, for I do not
believe in recommending medicines without
merit. As a # family remedy good for catarrh,
sore throat, colds, headaches, cuts, bruises,
sprains, rheumatism, neuralgia, in fact,
what all good medicines are good for, I
ctrongly advise the ÃBe of Dr. Halpruner's
Wonderful Medicine.

fered yesterday had disappeared.
In opening Hanna briefly reverted to the
cruise of the flying squadron from Cientuegos
to Santiago for the purpose of showing ihat
neither the Vixen nor the Merrlmac had been
the cause of delay on the voyage. He con
tinued his discussion of the retrograde move
ment, saying that but one explanation had
been given for It in Admiral Schley's dispatch,
namely, the inadequacy of the coal supply, al
though in his testimony before this court Ad
miral Schley gave four reasons for leaving his
station off Santiago.
Hanna contended that while Commodore
Sehley was acting under the orders contained
in dispatch No. 8 when the retrograde move
ment began, May' 26, that order was superseded
by the dispatches delivered on the Brooklyn
May 27 by Captain Cotton, in command of the
Harvard, and in one of which it was said that
"All the department's information indicates
the Spanish division is still at Santiago de
Cuba," and to which the order was added:
"The department looks to you to ascertain
the fact that the enemy, if therein, does not
leave without a decisive action." Hanna took
issue with Admiral Schley that this was a
suggestion and not a mandatory order.
"So far from being suggestive, doubtful or
uncertain are. the terms of this order that they
approach the verge of reproof," said Hanna.
"Their Incisive distinctness is notable, so much
bo that I think few subordinate officers, had
they turned their backs on a task to which
they had been assigned, would care to have
received such a telegraphic order from a super
ior couched In such terms."
Hanna quoted Admiral Schley's dispatch of.
May 27, in which he expressed regret over not
being able to obey orders, saying that as tt
was written after the Cotton dispatch had been
leceived it was an explicit confession that the
Cotton telegram was an order. Commenting
upon this dispatch he declared that It was
"the most remarkable one to be found in the
annals of the American navy." He contended
that the repairs to the Merrimac could have
been made, as they were, without going to
Key West, and that the Texas was not in
severe straits for fuel. As for the Vixen, he
said, she was not a fighting ship and could
have been sent for coal. He asserted that the
weather waa rough only on May 25, and that
therefore Commodore Schley's assertion that
the weather had been boisterous was un
founded.
The speaker also controverted the statement
made In Schley's dispatch to the department to
the effect that "it is not possible to cruise to
the eastward of Cape Cruz in the summer on ac
count of the southwest winds," alleging that
the wind was not from the southwest. Quot
ing from the same dispatch "it Is to be re
gretted the department's orders cannot be
obeyed," Hanna said the action of Admiral
Schley in abandoning his station/ off Santiago,
thus, as he himself states, failing to obey the
department's orders, created grave anxiety in
our national councils. Taking up the coal sup
ply of the fleet as required by specifications of
the precept, Hanna said:
The Supply of Coal.
"From the story of the commanding and
other officers of the Brooklyn, the lowa, the
Massachusetts, the Marblehead and the execu
tive and other officers of the Texas, and from
the steam logs of those vessels, it would ap
pear that fully and completely as any fact
can be shown by evidence it has been estab
lished that the fiytng squadron was on May 27
1898, fairly well equipped with coal."
Specification No. 7 was next considered. This
requires an inquiry as to whether every proper
effort was made to capture the Colon as that
vessel lay in th<# harbor at Santiago, and re
ferring to it Hanna said:
"Certain cautionary orders, some cf them

department and printed In the records and
also in the appendix of the Bureau of Naviga
tion, have been cited as forbidding the expos
ure of vessels to the fire of batteries and as
Justifying Commodore Schley's conduct of the
so-called reconnaissance of May 31. Assuming
that the substance of these orders was com
municated to Commodore Schley by Admiral
Sampson at Key West on the 18th of May, 1898.
It Is clear that they have no application to the
conditions existing at Santiago on the 31st of
May."
Hanna then referred to the eighth specifica
tion of the precept, concerning the withdrawal
of the ships of the flying squadron from the
vicinity of the harbor at Santiago at night.
Of this be said:
"It does not appear from the testimony ad
duced before this court that the vessels of the
flying squadron were withdrawn from the en
trance to Santiaco harbor to a distance at sea,
and therefore the extent and character of such
withdrawal need not be discussed."
Taking uo the blockade of Santiago, Hanna
said he did not feel compelled to discuss it,
and therefore would content himself with out
lining the charge. He said that beyond the
Brooklyn's turn the battle was not involved In
the Inquiry. He quoted Captain Evans of the
lowa and Lieutenant Nicholson of the Oregon
to sustain the contention that the Texas came
to a stop. Thus, he argued, a battleship was
not only imperiled but delayed by the danger
of collision at this critical time.
After the noon recess Hanna continued his
remarks concerning the Brooklyn's loop, con
tending that it was not made to avoid the
Brooklyn's beinsr rammed, as there â¢ v/as no
such effort at that time. He quoted Comman
der Wainwrlght's testimony to the effect that
the Brooklyn's turn left a gap for the escape
of the enemy.
Hanna also discussed the reported colloquy
between Commodore Schley and Lieutenant
Hodgson, which forms the tenth count in the
precej<t, in which Schley was reported to have
said during the turn, "Damn the Texas." This
remark. Hanna said, showed a lack of Inter
est in another ship of the fleet. He expressed
the opinion that there was much to suatain
Hodgson's recollection of this incident. He
also discussed the question of the correspond
ence between Admiral Schley and Lieutenant
Commander Hodgson on this subject. That
correspondence had been initiated by the ad
miral, said Hanna, and he made the point that
in his letters Hodgson had maintained the cor
rectness of his original position. With his re-,
marks ur>on this correspondence. Hanna con
cluded his speech at 2:30 p. m., having spoker.
about four and a half hours.
Captain Parker, Junior counsel for Admiral
Schley, then began his address In support of
Admiral Schley? Â¦
"I doubt." said Carteln Parker, If the
naval history of the world presents or ever has
presented a case of the importance and char
acter of the case we have st long been en
caged UDon. I doubt if a tribunal more ex
alted In the character of the persons who com
pose it ever sat in Judgment UDon a
brother officer. I doubt if an officer with the
life-long cbaracler and standing and conduct
that Admiral Schley has always displayed was
ever called upon before to ask an investiga
tion of his conduct as a victorious commander
Continuing. Captain Parker compared this
ease with the charges at the battle of Luke Erie
Then there might have been some foundation,
but in this there was no foundation whatever.
He said the court had in Its wisdom presented
romrarison with other officers engaged in the
Santiago campatgn. "There is no accuser here."
he said, "nobody is on trial, and yet the case
has been conducted s*. though Commodore
Schley were on trial. We get, it." he went on.
"in the order of the argument now being made
here. We nre compelled tc consider the inquiry
as a trial."
Sampson's Orders to Schley.
Taking up the events of the campaign in
their sequence. Captain Parker spoke of the
interviews between Admiral Sampson and Com
modore Schley at Key West, saying that he
would not give Admiral Schley's testimony on
this point. He pointed out, however, that
Schley was not then Informed that the Spanish
fleet had left Curacao, notwithstanding Samp
son had been in possession of this information
for three or four days. He then quoted Samp
pon's orcWs to Schley tv proceed to Cienfuegos
and there establish a blockade, and quoted
Schley's testimony to the effect that Sampson
told him he had at that time no advices as to
the whereabouts of the Spaniard?.
Speaking of the cruise to Cienfuegos, Captain
Parker said it was inconsistent to criticise Ad
miral Schley for stopping to take Captain Ches
ter on board while at the same time criticising
him for not calling Captain McCalla aboard.
"We can't," he said, "blow hot and cold in
the same breath. The truth Is there was no
real delay in the voyage."
Reverting to the claim that Commodore
Schley had not made proper efforts to locate the
enemy at Cienfuegos, Captain Parker said that
the task of landing a boat on the coast was an
exceedingly dangerous one.
"There is no evidence." he said, "to show
that Captain Mc^alla made attempt to
s^nd his men on shore, except during his cable
cutting expedition, when the results were dis
astrous. He assumed, and rightfully assumed,
that Hie people there were enemies and he
acted accordingly."
As for the Cienfuegos blockade, he held it
was sufficient that no vessel had gone in or
out without permission. Admiral Schley had
taken all steps to ascertain if the enemy was
there. The question of the signal lights on
shore at Olenfuegns was also reverted to and
the speaker said it was certain thnt Commo
dore Schley had not known anything of their
significance until Captain McCalla arrived.
What earthly reason Captain Chad wick had for
not communicating the signals to him. Captain
Parker said, was beyond his comprehension. So
far as seen Chadwlck was the only person to
whom McCalla had communicated his code
Hence, if Chadwick had prepared the McCalla
memorandum it could very well be inferred, as
he had Information that no one else had. that
he would have regarded the memorandum in
a different light .from others who knew less.
"I contend," he said, "that up to this time
so far as the blockade is concerned, so far as
his conduct there is concerned, there is abso
lutely nothing to show by the testimony fn
this case of the slightest suspicion of fault to
be placed upon Commodore Schley."
i' ,â¢ ;â¢,..â¢. .. . . â Â/. â *
The speaker then read the "Dear Schley" let
ter of May ' 20, In which Admiral Sampson said
he had decided not to change his plans to hold
Cieniuegos, as he felt .that even if Cervera
had taken refuge at Santiago he must Inevi
tably i still 'go . to - Clenfuegoa, and commented
upon It at some length. He Â¦ contended that
both this dispatch and No: 8 had been sent at
a later date. than had been suggested by the
naval ', officials. Sampson had, . he said, in
structed Schley to remain at Cienfuegos, not
withstanding the department's advice to pro
ceed to Santiago, .' and 'in No. 8 discretion hacf
plainly been given to Schley. i _'â¢
"Suppose," he said, "he had gone off and it
had been found that the Spaniards were there;
he would have been condemned, and justly, and
in '}. case :of : court-martial learned friends here
would have thundered against him. I say that
no criticism 'is- deserved for the commodore's
conduct at Cienfuegos." -- â¢
Taking up the question of the progress of
the flying squadron from Cientuegos to San
tiago, . Captain Parker said if any one Would
take the trouble to look at the logs of the
ships it will be seen that there is nothing in
that charge. . . â¢
"I'preier to take what the officers wrote at
the tune rather than what they say now."
Parker claimed that In the passage from
Cientuegoa to Santiago the speed of the slow
est vessel of the squadron must be the speed
of > the squadron. It would not have been the
common sense idea of the situation he said, to
have abandoned the collier and make all speed
lor Santiago. . \ , .
Â¦ Captain Parker also â¢ commended Commodore
â¢ Schley' s conduct of the cruise to Santiago. He
said he . had acted according to the dictates
of his best judgmentâ a judgment which, the
captain said, was better than that of less ex
perienced officers," an experience which had been
gained Â¦in ; command "under circumstances of
every nature. In the Arctic, around both eapes,
on every sea and under every sun. He was
at least ias likely to be as correct as those
young . officers who for the first time in their
lives were given command of a small boat."
Taking the fleet to the southward from San
tiago, May 26, Captain Parker detailed the
meeting with the scout boats - and said that
the condemnation of the commodore for not
communicating with Captains Jewel and Wisa
was puerile. ' . , .
"Air that Wise had to do," he said, "was to
signal that he had important information and
he would have been asked to come on board.
It is the business, the clear duty, of any sub
ordinate officer to make known to his superior
any information he may Mb. ye."
-; In - the - absence of . information by the cap
tains of . the Yale and Minneapolis Captain
Parker held Commodore Schley had a right to
suppose that Captain Sigsbee had given all
the information to be had from the scouts.
Captain Parker said that officer was "curiously
blind, not purposely blind, but curiously blind.
He not only had not been able to find out
anything about the Colon, but when she was
there and in plain sight on May 25, a clear,
bright day, when 'Sigsbee was off the harbor
he failed to see her. This is to me one of
the mysteries of the campaign."
' Commodore Acted Wisely.
j Continuing, he said that with the Information
given Schley had acted wisely in turning back
to Key "West. "Whether he acted wisely and
his judgment was sound is for you, gentlemen
of the court, to say, not with the information
that has come since, but with the light that
the commodore had at that time." â¢
Going back to the cruise to Cienfueeos Cap
tain Parker referred to the sending away of
the Eagle. - He said that Commodore Schley
had not sent that vessel away from choice,
but because of his great " need for auxiliary
cruisers. Captain Parker referred to the dis
patch from the department received by the
Harvard at Mole . St. Nicholas. May 26.
"Proceed at once and Inform Schley and also
senior officer present off . Santiago de Cuba,"
he read from the dispatch. "That -dispatch
does not 'contemplate at all that Admiral
Schley Is at Santiago," he continued. "It Is
to Inform Commodore Schley and also the com
manding 'officer off Santiago. So that at that
time. the department evidently did not contem
plate that Commodore Schley had arrived at
Santiago, and yet we have heard it said he
was due there on the 24th."
. Quoting frqm the dispatch Captain Parker
read: "The department's information Indicates
the Spanish division is still at Santiago."
"Is there anything positive about that?" he
asked. "If the department had chosen to Bay
that the Spanish squadron was at Santiago,
that would have been another thing, but it did
not say that. There were still some doubts
apparent in the mind of the department on that
subject."
Referring at -this point to the testimony of
Captln Sigsbee. Captain Parker said it was not
necessary to, impeach anybody's veracity. "But
slippery memory, after all these years, is a
very unsa/o . thing to go by." he ' continued,
"and the/memory of four or five persons as to
what' Sigsbee said is better than that of Sigs
bee. I think the court can be sure that Cap
tain Sigf-bee did say to Commodore Schley when
he came aboard the Brooklyn that 'the Dons
are not, there.' " ;
Again quoting from the dispatch, Captain
Parker read: . Â¦Â¦ ...
"The department looks to you to ascertain
facts."
"Did not the commodore ascertain facts?"
he asked. " "And that the enemy therein does
not â¢ leave without decisive action' " he- con
tinued, reading. /"Well, was there not decisive
action?" he asked. "The poor old Spanish ad
miral came out with his tiags flying . gaily at
his mastheads on that Sunday morning and be
fore 1 o'clock of that day he saw his ships on
the beach burning, blowing up and all de
stroyed. He came on board the American ship
without shoes for his feet or. hat for his head,
in a pair of drawers and an undershirt. De
cisive action! Was there anything that was
more decisive than that?"
â¢ Captain Parker then took up Commodore
Schley's dispatch forwarded by the Harvard
and defended the position - taken by the com
modore in that message. He then referred ti
the sentence In which the commodore informed
the department that he had been unable to
obey orders, "earnestly as all have striven."
If a subordinate informs us that he is unable
to obey . orders we -do not charge him with
disobedience. We censure him for bad judg
ment, but for nothing more serious.' Failure
under such circumstances is not always diso
bedience. We can all look back and see how
we could have done differently. "Now I say
that Commodore Schley never had any orders.'
It was merely a suggestion as to what he did
do. He was to find out if that squadron was
there and to see that it did not leave without
a decisive action. Even if it is true that the
commodore committed gross errors of - Judg
ment, Â¦ which I do not admit, he had no motive
but to do his whole duty, as from the begin
ning be has always done it, no more, no less.".
Â¦ Concluding his remarks for the day, . Captain
Parker said:.
; "That brings us to a discussion of the so
called . reconnaissance, which I think can be
summed up in a very few words. We have had
the Information of all the gentlemen who were
clothed with no responsibility in the case that
they -could" and they would, etc., etc. Well,
perhaps they would, undoubtedly ' they could
nave gone in, -the whole of them, and risked
the. ships and been called fools for their pains.
They might have come out successful, they
might have done something to the Colon which
was. not done; they might have sunk her. I
do not think that Is In the least probable.
There, is one little Incident about this matter.
We are . permitted to get up to the Ist of June
and" we see by : the log of the Colon / that she
was there. until 1:35. At 7 o'clock l/i the morn
ing, the commander, in chief. Admiral Sampson,
came there and the Colon was pointed out to
him. . and I there . she lay for four hours and a
half without a. gun being fired at her. I am not
blaming anybody for this. Â¦
"The exercise of the slightest judgment,"
the Â¦ speaker said, when the clock struck four. .
"Time's up," said Admiral Dewey. and with
out giving the captain an opportunity to con
clude : the sentence the court adjourned.

First Returns All for Schmitz.
The first precincts heard from were
from the districts south of Market street.
They Bhowed an almost two-to-one vote
for Schmitz. In many instances Schmitz
polled twice as many votes as his oppo
nents' combined votes. The bulletins con
veying this information were invariably
given publicity first by The Call, and it
was before The Call screens that the bulk
of the crowd was congregated. The Schmitz
people in the crowd cheered each suc
ceeding bulletin over and over again. The
Wells and Tobin supporters could scarce
ly give credence to the authenticity of
the figures presented. At first they deem
ed the returns erroneous, but this impres
sion was fast removed as bulletins fol
lowed one another with the same story
of Union Labor pluralities all along the
line in Democratic districts. The faith of
the Wells and Tobin men was at 9 o'clock
pinned to the Republican districts, in
which It was hoped Wells would gain a
lead with pluralities which would soon
overcome Schmitz's strides south of Mar
ket street Even this hope was shattered
later, when The Call bulletins showed
that in the stronghold of the Republicans,
as well as in Democratic precincts,
Schmitz held his own. All hope was
abandoned at 10 o'clock, when it was
whispered among the crowd that Maurice
Asher, chairman of the Republican Coun
ty Committee, had conceded the election
of Schmitz. When the bulletin express

Wells Men Regain Hope.
Men of wealth stood beside sturdy sons
of toil, and did not disdain to argue the
issues of the hour with them. When a
Schmitz bulletin told the story of his ad
vancement to the front with a particu
larly favorable showing, the Schmitz
sympathizers cried out, "Give It to 'em,
Schmitz."
When a bulletin showed Wells to be In
the lead In some Republican precinct the
same men would yell, "We expected that.
It's no use though. Wells can never re
gain his lost ground." For Tobin there
were few who had aught save kind words
to say In his behalf. The manly battle
waged by Tobin throughout the cam
paign evoked admiring- comments on all
sides, and his hopeless defeat awakened
the sympathy of all save those radical
men who see no virtue In the opponents
of the men whose cause they have es
poused.
Shortly after 10 o'clock the bulletins be
gan to show gains for Wells, and the ad
herents of that gentleman began to dis
play unwillingness to admit his defeat un
til the very last vote was counted, and
their hopes reviving. An occasional cheer
could "be heard when a Wells bulletin was
displayed. But a moment later, a Schmitz
bulletin would tell another story, and
then the Union Labor men would make
the welkin ring with their shouts. Still,
for some time the filial result waa doubt
ful. At one time Schmitz was losing
ground, and at another Wells was closing
the gap between himself and his youth

ful rival for Mayoralty honors. The
crowd grew feverish. The first reports
pointed to Schmitz as a sure winner, and
later "Wells began to forge to the front.
It was a time for speculation, and men
speculated freely. Hundreds left for their
homes at 11 o'clock with the conviction
that while the indications at that hour
pointed to Schmitz as :he next Mayor,
the result would not be definitely known
until the last precinct had been heard

Spec Hal Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Nov. 5.-Rear Ad
miral Bowles, Chief Constructor, has
taken measures which will result In the
destruction of many documents bearing
upon the history of the sailing navy of
the United States.
For eighty years plans of old vessels,
reports ana specifications, list 3of con
struction stores and papers descriptive of
every foot of live oak cut on Government
reservations for men-of-war have accu
mulated in the Construction Department
and have filled up all the room available.
The needs of the modern navy are such
that It is imperative that space shall be
provided for reports and other documents
relating thereto. Rear Admiral Bowles
has therefore directed the transfer to the
navy yard of something like 35,000 plans
which will be stored in a fireproof vault
at that point.
Reports and documents relating to mat
ters which can never arise again will be
put aside for destruction. Before they
can be disposed of It will be necessary
under the law for Congress to appoint a
committee of Senators and Representa
tives to examine them.

NETV TORK, Nov. s.â Seth Low,
former president of Columbia
University, end four years a&J
the Citizens' Union candidate
for the first Mayor of Greater
New York, was elected to-day
the second Mayor of Greater
â¢few York by a plurality ranging any
mhere from 80,000 to 40,000, defeating Ed
ward M. Shepard of Brooklyn, the Dem
ocratic nominee. The campaign was an
exciting one, and the vote, though some
what lese than in the Presidential election
b. year ago, was the largest ever polled in
a municipal contest in this country.
In addition to the canvass for Mayor,
public interest largely centered in the
nomination by the fusionists of William
Travers Jerome for District Attorney and
Mayor Robert A. Van Wyck by the Dem
ocrats for Justice of the Supreme Court,
who v.-ere voteo for only in the territory
contained in Now York County. Returns
received up to 11 p. m. indicate that
Jerome has been elected by a comtortabie
plurality and that Mayor Van Wyck has
oeon defeated, the latter running behind
his ticket from 15.000 to 20,000.
Triumph for Fusion Ticket.
F.eturns also indicate the complete tri
umph here of the Greater New York
fusion ticket, Charles Vincent Fornes,
the nominee of the Citizens' Union and
the Republicans for President of the
Bo;ird of Aldermen, defeating George M.
Vai Hoesen, the Democratic nominee. E
M. Grout, for the past four years LVmo
< ratic President of the borough of Brook
lyn, now the fusionist nominee for Comp
troller, has also defeated W. W. Ladd Jr.,
Democrat.
Returns from the local, borough and
county tickets are incomplete. Complete
returns received from Staten Island, how

been defeated in his canvass for President
of the borough of Richmond by George

Victory Throughout the State.
Reports received from the various sec
tions of New York State show that the
Republicans will retain control of the
lower house of the State Legislature, the
number of Republican and Democratic
Assemblymen not differing materially
from the figures of preceding years. In
the various municipal contests reported
trori up the State the most interesting
elections noted were those of Albany,

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A Sour Stomach
Is Often the Real Cause of a i
Sour Temper.
That the condition of the digestive or-
gans has a marked effect upon the charac-
ter or disposition If a trui?m as old as j
the hills. Old Ben Johnson wisely said, |
v|**
"thÂ« pleasure of living depends upon the
liver, and it is a fact which none may
dispute that a sunny disposition more
often results from a healthy digestion
than from any other cause.
Acid dyspepsia, commonly called sour
stomach or heartburn, is caused by slow
digestion of food; Instead of being prompt-
ly digested and converted into blood, bone
and muscle, it lies in the stomach for
hours, fermenting and decaying, creating
gases which cause pressure on the lungs
ard heart, short breath and general dis-
comfort and Irritation.
Such half digested food is Indeed poor
nourishment for the body, brain and
norves and the result is shown In irritable
tempers, unaccountable headaches and
that depressing condition usually called
the "blues." But how quickly all these
disappear when appetite and digestion are
restored.
Laxative medicines only irritate the al-
ready irritated stomach and bowels and
hav.j no effect upon actual digestion of
food. â¢â¢Â¦ "j v I
Trie sensible course to follow is to. make
use of simple natural digestives like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after meals
until the stomach has a chance to recup-
erate.
The natural digestives which every heal-
thy stomach contains are peptones, dias-
tase and Hydrochloric and lactic acids
and when any of them are lacking the
trouble begins. The reason Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are so valuable and suc-
cessful in curing stomach troubles is be-
causie they contain, in a pleasant concen-
trated tablet form, all these absolutely
necessary essentials for perfect digestion
and assimilation of food.
Henry Kirkpatrick of Lawrence, Mass.,
save;: "Men and women whose occupation
precludes an active out door life should
make it a dally practice to use Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after meals. I have
don-i sc myself and I know positively that
I owe my present health and vigor to
their daily use.
"From the time I was 22, when I gradu-
ated from school with broken health from
overwork, until I was 34. I scarcely knew
whs.t it was .to be free from stomach
weakness. I had no appetite whatever for
breakfast and very little for any other
meal.
"I had acidity and heartburn nearly
every day and sometimes was alarmed by
irregularity and palpitation of the heart,
but all this gradually disappeared after I
begun using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and I can eat my meals with relish and
satisfaction which I liad not known since
1 was a growing boy."
The MOM and popularity of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets is enormous, but it is
deserved, and every druggist in the United
States. Canada and Great Britain has a
good word for this meritorious prepara-
tion. ... - .

ITALIANS BURN
CROKER'S EFFIGY
Chief of the Tammany Tribe
Not Popular in Latin Quar
ter of Greater New York
NEW YORK, Nov. s.âRichard
Croker was burned in effigy by
several hundred Italians to
night. A life-size figure was
suspended between two houses
in Elizabeth street. The Ital
ians danced around it, prodding
it with sticks and knives.
"Hurray for Set' Low" some cried.
"Tell wid da Crok' " "shouted others.
In the meantime boys gathered boxes and
barrels. These were piled high, below the
figure, and then set on fire. Before the
fire had been burning long firemen from
truck 9 came running to the scene and
soon extinguished It, not, however, before
the stuffed figure had been badly burned.
The city of Albany was carried by the Re
publicans, ex-Senator David B. Hill taking
no active part in the local canvass. The
election In Troy was a lively one, a num
ber of arrests for illegal voting being
made. Former United States Senator
Murphy headed the fight for the candidate
of the Democrats, while former Governor
Black managed the campaign for the pro
gressive Democratic-Republican ticKeL
Daniel E. Conway, the candidate for
Mayor, supported by ex-Governor Black,
wai easily elected. In Buffalo the entire
Republican city and county tickets were
elected. Erastus C. Knight, the State
Comptroller, being chosen Mayor. The re
sult in Rochester was close, but Mayor
Warner's friends claim the election of the
Republican candidate.
Battle of the Ballots.
After several weeks of the hottest cam
paign fighting ever seen in this city over
a municipal election, the day when the
ballots were cast passed with unwonted
quiet, considering the high feeling that
had previously been exhibited. There were
a few fights at the polls among individ
uals, but none of a serious nature and
out of the scores of arrests made few
prisoners were held by the magistrates.
The great feature of the voting was the
early casting of ballots. There was a
drizzling rain up to 9 o'clock, but after
that hour there was nothing to keep the
most fastidious voter from the polls. Seth
Low. Fusion candidate for Mayor, cast
his ballot at 7:55 a. m. Edward M. Shep
ard. the Democratic candidate, voted at
1:25. Richard Croker and his two sons
were numbered one, two and "* three at
their polling places a minute after 6 a. m.
Senator Depew dropped his ballot into the
box at 5:45 a. m. and Mayor Van Wyck
waited until 3 n. m.
The practical use of a voting machine
was demonstrated in the Eighteenth Dis
trict, Brooklyn, and the result was known
at 5:02 o'clock in the afternoon, imme
diately after the polls were closed. No
difficulty was experienced in recording the
vote and in many instances men cast their
votes in lesr; than three second?.
An incident which attracted attention
in New York City was the refusal of the
election Judges In one district to allow
one voter to cast his ballot because he had
made a bet of a box of cigars on the result
of the election.
Tammany Men Get Returns.
Richard Croker received the returns in
what is known as "the private room" of
Tammany Hall. The leader was sur
rounded by a crowd of men long promi
nent in the organization, among them
John Carroll, deputy leader; Mayor Van
Wyck, Corporation Counsel Whalen and
City Chamberlain T. C. T. Crane. Croker
sat at the press table and listened with
his customary lack of expressed emotion
as the bulletins were read. From the first
they were unfavorable and the crowd of
leaders heard the figures called off with
out comment.
Croker directed that from time to time
comparisons be made with tne vote of last
year.
Mayor VÂ»n Wyck. who was a candidate
for the Supreme Court bench and who
was bitterly assailed during the campaign,
was an interested listener as the returna
came in.
Crowds such as are seen on the night
of Presidential elections surrounded the
bulletin boards of the newspaper offices.
Because of the danger of accidents re
sulting from the subway excavations
near the City Hall some 500 policemen
were on hand. A cordon was formed
which practically shut off Park Row from
the head of Beekman street to the bridge
entrance, and the streets leading into
Park Row at that point were closed. The
street cars were stopped at Center street.
REBUKES f AJOIANY ORGEE.
NEW TORK. Nov. s.âAbout 11 o'clock
to-night Seth Low gave out a formal
statement, In which he said:
The outcome of this election Is a. splendid
vindication of unlversel suffrage. From all
parts of the city have come the votes that have
rebuked the Tammary orgle of the last four
years. All the patronage of the city and limit
less money hn\ re not availed azafnst the
aroused inditrnatlon of the peoDle, and it Is
safe to say that absentee government and gov
ernment for private Bain will not be seen
again In New York for many a day. This Is
no man'F triumph, but It Is the people's vic
tory- The agencies that have brousrht it
about ere manj-. Those who labored bo long
and so patiently to bring about the successful
fusion of many elements and those who have
supported the fusion so loyally are all entitled
to the greatest credit. For myself. I a.k for
the generous and constant support of the com
munity in the great task to which it has sum
moned me.
Low Is in receipt of hundreds of tele
grams from prominent men, not only In
the city but also from different parts of
the State and country, among them being
congratulations from President Roosevelt
and Senator Foraker of Ohio.
Republicans Elected Mayors.

A Democratic Mayor was elected In Utica,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1901.
MAYOR GEORGE H. CLARK ROUTS
HIS OPPONENTS IN SACRAMENTO
Making the Race as an Independent Candidate, He Is Re
elected by a Vote That Dazes the Managers of the Re
publican Organization, Carrying Nearly Every Precinct
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. s.â George H.
Clark has been re-elected Mayor
of Sacramento, after one of the
bitterest and most exerting cam
paigns thl? city has even wit
nessed. To-night he walked
through the downtown streets,
escorted by nearly 2000 cheering support
er? and a brass band. When the crowd
rauhed the block on which are located
the Bee and the Record-Union offices,
both of which papers fought his candi
dacy, Clark was lifted on the shoulders of
his adherents and waved a good natured
salute to his journalistic opponents.
The regular Republican organization is
fairiy dazed by the rout. The victory of
Clark over the Republican nominee, Land,
is regarded as a step toward the realiza
tion of his ambition to control local Re
publican politics. He has carried nearly
every precinct In the town and even in
Land's strongest quarter his majority has
been considerable. The vote of James H.
Devine, the Democratic candidate, has
fallen far short cf expectations, while
General L. Tozer, the Municipal League
candidate, polled but a small vote, as did
also S. Edgar Alderman, the Socialist
nominee.
Republican Ticket Weak.
The Republicans here, as in San Fran
cisco, are blamed for having put up what
was in many respects a weak ticket, and
thus jeopardized the' life of the organi
zation. In fact, this criticism has been
most pronounced on the part of some
high in the councils of the party, but
whose advice was not heeded. The Re
publicans lose their Trustee in the Sec
ond Ward, Charles Paine, who Is defeated
by J. Grant Black, a Democrat, and their
Trustee In the Ninth Ward. J. H. Dolan,
who is defeated by Edward Carragher,
Democrat.
FUSIONISTS ARE DEFEATED.
Republican Ticket Is Successful in
Nebraska.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Nov. 6, 1 a. m.â All
returns received up to 1 o'clock this morn
ing indicate that all the Republican ticket
has been elected perhaps by as much as
10,000 majority. The figures upon which
this estimate is made is based upon pre
cinct returns, which show average Re
publican gains of about 4 to the pre
cinct.
The returns from 158 precincts outsidÂ«
of Lincoln and Omaha give Sedgwick
(R.) for Supreme Judge, a total of 15,970,
against 12,293 for Hollenbeck (Fusion;.
These same precincts a year ago gave
Marsh (R.) 17,532 votes, against 14,891 for
Svboda (Fusion). This means that Sedg
wick's majority in these precincts Is about
1,000 more than the majority received by
Marsh. As Marsh carried the State by
nearly 5000, this means that if the re
maining precincts make the same compar
ative showing there can be no question
as to the election of Judge Sedgwick by
a very handsome majority.
Chairman Lindsay of the Republican
committee, who throughout has been con
servative, says the Republicans have
carried the State by not less than 5000.
Chairman De France of the Fusionists
does not concede defeat. The city of Lin
coln and Lancaster County furnished a
surprise by giving Sedgwick nearly 1400
plurality.
Veterans at the Polls.
LEAVEN WORTH, Kans., Nov. s.â The
Veterans at the National Military Home
here voted in .the election to-day for the
first time under the act of Congress giv
ing them the franchise. They cast a light
vote. Bleakley, Republican for Commis
sioner, is elected by about 800 majority.
Small Vote in Virginia.
RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 6.â The weather
reduced the vote in the State. Returns
up to 2 o'clock this morning sustain last
night's dispatches that the Democrats
have elected their State ticket by some
25,000 majority and a big majority in the
General Assembly.
Republicans Elect Judges.
SIOUX FALLS, S. D., Nov. 6.â Eight
Circuit Judges were elected In this State
and the Republicans claim all. The Dem
ocrats do not concede Republican success
in the Third and Seventh districts.
Murphy Elected Governor.
TRENTON, N. J., Nov. s.â Republicans
claim that Franklin Murphy is elected
Governor by 10,000 majority over James
M. Seymour, the Democratic candidate.
A large vote was polled.
While personally a man of probity and
worth, William Land was not considered
as possessed of the elements necessary
to successfully oppose Clark, who, de
spite public criticism of his acts, rias al
ways maintained a strong personal pop
ularity with various classes of voters.
Clark's adherents declare that to-day's
victory means the overthrow of Colonel
J. B. Wright and J. L. Gillis as directors
in the Republican ranks. Certainly it
nas the appearance of a body blow from
which they may not soon recover. It is
not remembered that an independent can
didate, indorsed by no party and having
no newspaper at hi 6 back, has ever be
fore won his way into an office of such
importance in the city or county.
Colonel Wright's Defeat.
Even the personal entrance of Colonel
Wright into the fight and his opening of
headquarters, where he besought the rail
road shopmen, his former allies, to vote
against Clark, has been barren of effec
tive results, and where Wright's future
power is to come from is not discover
able. It is true that the central commit
tee remains with him but its handling of
the campaign has not been regarded as
brilliant or as assuring strength to over
come the fight for control which Clark
is so boldly making. Clark owes much
of the success of his campaign to the
clever management of Hiram W. John
son, bis attorney in the now famous oil
land case against Wright.
The late returns indicate that Clark's
plurality will reach nearly 1000.
S. Luke Howe (R.) was elected City
Atttomey: Dr. F. F. Tebbets, RepublG
can candidate for Trustee in the Second
Ward, has defeated George K. Rider by
a few votes; Charles M. Prodger (D.)
has been elected City Treasurer over A.-
L. Frost (R.).
On the water question more people have
voted for Sacramento River water as it
is than have voted either for water from
the east side wells or filtered river
water.
CROKER WILL RETIRE.
Tammany's Leader Says He Has
Made His Last Campaign.
NEW YORK, Nov. s.â Richard Croker.
Maurice Untermeyer and Senator T. D.
Sullivan were together at dinner to-night
and It is said on good authority that a
little later Croker said this was his last
political fight. Croker asked Senator Sul
livan whom he desired as leader. Senator
Sullivan answered that John F. Carroll
would be pleasing to him. Then and there.
It Is said, Richard Croker abdicated his
leadership of Tammany Hall and turned
it over to John F. Carroll.
There was some discussion as to the
plans of a reorganization of Tammany, In
which Croker took no part except to sug
gest that younger blood be admitted to
the inner councils of the wigwam. The
party proceeded to Tammany Hall, where
John F. Carroll was awaiting them. He
was apprised of the purpose of Croker,
but said nothing. He accompanied Croker
to the Democratic Club In a cab and re
mained closeted with him for nearly an
hour. It was after this conference that
Croker announced: "This is my last cam
paign."
It is now said that Daniel F. McMahon
will call a meeting of the executive com
mittee within a week, when Croker will
tender his resignation and on motion of
Senator Timothy D. Sullivan John F. Car
roll will be elected the new leader of Tam
many Hall.

NEW YORK, Nov. s.â Following Is a

Kansas Republicans Successful.
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. s.â Local Â©lec
tions were held In every county In Kan
sas to-day, County Commissioners and
School Trustees being the only officers
elected. Republicans were generally suc
cessful. The Republicans claim that in
the results of to-day they can forecast a
safe majority for the Republicans la the
next Legislature.
BIG PLURALITY
OF REPUBLICANS
Voters of Ohio Re-elect Nash
Governor on Hanna's Ad
vice to "Let Well Alone"
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. s.â The
Republicans to-day carried Ohio
by such increased plurality on
their ticket and with such an en
larged majority in the Legisla
ture as to cause all sorts of
comment on "what did it?"
The result continues the Republi
cans in power In the State, mak
ing an epoch of twelve .years In succes
sion for that party in Ohio, and It in
sures the re-election of Senator Foraker.
The extent of the Republican success is
attributed to the Silver Democrats not
voting; to the attitude of John R. Mc-
Lean, the Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor two years ago, and the Ohio mem
ber of the National Democratic Commit
tee; to the superior organization of the
Republicans and other causes. The Re
publicans attribute the result largely to
ihe popular desire not to disturb the
prevailing prosperity, In accordance with
Senator Hanna's appeal to "let well
enough alone"; to the desire to support
President Roosevelt in carrying out the
policy of the late President McKlnley,
and to indorse Governor Nash and Sena
tor Foraker. "
The Republicans are so elated over
their triumph that they are talking of
Congressman Dick, who has been chair
man of their State Committtee for eleven
years, for Governor two years hence,
when Senator Hanna stands for re-elec
tion, and it is generally predicted that
John R. McLean then will be the Demo
cratic candidate for Senator. It Is be
lieved that Charles R. Baker of Cincin
nati, who has been an avowed candidate
against Foraker, will receive the com
plimentary vote of the Democratic minor
ity in the present Legislature for Sen
ator. Hamilton County, which includes
Cincinnati, sent a mixed delegation to the
last Legislature, when John R. McLean
(D.) carried that county for Governor.
The delegation then had only two-Repub
licans. This year the delegation consists
of thirteen Republicans. Lucas County
had two Republican members In the last
Legislature, but under the new census It
has four members, all Republicans. The
Democrats gain four members in Frank
lin and one in Adams and Pike conn
ties. The Republicans gain one member
each In Summit. Muskingum. Ross and
William counties. In the last Legislature
Montgomery had one Republican and one
Democratic member. This year that
county elected three Republican mem
bers. So far as the returns indicate, the
local option candidates of both parties
for the Legislature have been defeated.
The liquor men are especially jubilant
over the defeat of T.-H. Clark, one of the
Republican candidates In Franklin
County, who was the author of the local
option bill that was defeated in the last
Legislature.
KENTUCKY DEMOCRATS WIN.
New General Assembly Will Elect a
United States Senator.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. s.â The Gen
eral Assembly that was elected In Ken
tucky to-day, with the exception of half

do not show the election of a single Popu
list to the Assembly. In addition to elect
ing a United States Senator the new As

and Circuit Court districts for ten years.
In the city of Louisville the Democrats

AND EASTERN VICTORIOUS
CANDIDATES.
CRANE SECURES
VAST MAJORITY
Defeats Josiah Quincy for
Governor of Massachusetts
by Over Seventy Thousand
BOSTON, Nov. 5.â W. Murray
Crane (R.) was elected Governor
of Massachusetts for the third
time to-day by a majority of 70,408
over Josiah Quincy, the Demo
cratic candidate. The Republi
cans also elected their entire
State ticket and will have a heavy major
ity In the House and Senate. Returns
from all the towns and cities In the State
except Dartmouth give Crane 186,500,
Quincy (D.) 115,370. Dartmouth last year
gave Crane (R.) 247 and Paine (D.) 27.
The total vote of the State ran over SOO,
00, the largest vote ever cast in the State
In an off year. The Legislature of 1902
will stand 199 Republicans, 79 Democrats
and 2 Social Democrats on a joint vote of
both houses. The Democrats made a gain
In the House, but suffered a loss In the
Senate.
Much interest in the returns centered In
this city, which went for Quincy by about
700. The Democrats also elected all their
candidates for off years in Suffolk County
by much larger margins than that given
Quincy.
SLOW RETURNS IN COLORADO.
Republicans Show Their Strength in
Several of the Counties.
DENVER, Nov. s.â The returns re
ceived up to 11:30 o'clock indicate that In
this (Arapahoe) county the entire Demo
cratic ticket Is elected by from 2000 to 5000.
Some of the Democratic candidates were
scratched heavily, but all are elected. Re
turns from the State are very meager.
Dispatches from Pueblo indicate that
Pueblo has gone Republican and news
from Colorado Springs is to the same ef
fect regarding El Paso County. Leadvllle
dispatches claim a Republican majority
of 500 in Lake County. Teller County (the
Cripple Creek mining district) is Demo
cratic, but figures are unobtainable at this
hour. In many counties of the State local
Issues governed. The day passed without
serious disturbances so far as heard from.
Mississippi Elects Democrats.
JACKSON, Miss., Nov. 5.â Private tele
grams from the large towns indicate that
the Incumbents, George W. Carlisle and
Joseph TV. Power, who are appointees of
Governor Longino, have been elected
State Treasurer and Secretary of State
respectively. Full returns will not be re
ceived for a day or two, as numerous pre
cincts are off the railroads and without
telephone connection. All the candidates
were Democrats.

Congratulations to Mr. Low
WASHINGTON, Nov. s.âPresi
dent Roosevelt returned to
the city to-night at 3:30 from
Oyster Bay, where he cast
his ballot. With him were
Mrs. Roosevelt, Secretary
Cortelyou, Private Secretary
Loeb and Dr. P. M. Rlxey. The party oc
cupied the private car Lucania, which
was attached to the rear of the Florida
and Southwestern express of the Pennsyl
vania Railroad. On arrival here the
President, after shaking hands with the
porter, led the way with Mrs. Roosevelt
to the carriages in waiting and the party
was taken directly to the White House.
Quite a number of persons were as
sembled at the station, and the President
lifted his hat several times in response
to their saiutationa.
An extra detail of police and a large
force of secret service officers were on
hand to see that no harm befell the chief
executive. The President's trip from New
York to Washington was without special
incident. The party remained in the car
anc" avoided moving about to any extent.
At Jersey City the President shook hand*
with a number of friends while waiting
for the train to leave.
President Roosevelt was kept Informed
of the results of the election during the
evening while aboard the train returning
to Washington, and later at the Whit*
House, by the Associated Press bulletins
and by private dispatches. While anxious
for news from every quarter, his great
est interest centered in the result in New
York City, and he expressed keen satis
faction over the election of the fusion
ticket there. Soon after reaching the
White House he telegraphed his congratu
lations to Mayor-elect Low and after
ward when the election of Jerome ap
peared to be beyond question he sent a
telegram* to the new District Attorney.
BIG PLURALITY IN IOWA.
Cummins Is Elected Governor by
Ninety Thousand Votes.
DES MOINES. lowa. Nov. s.â The re
sult in lowa is remarkable. With a
marked falling off in the vote through
out the State, the loss in some precincts
being 40 and 50 per cent in the total vote,
and the average loss for the State being
one-fifth of the total of two years ago,
A. B. Cummins, the Republican candidate
for Governor, has been elected by a plu
rality of something like 90,000, the largest
ever given a Governor in this State.
The entire Republican State ticket is
elected by similar pluralities and some ex
traordinary gains have been made. Chair
man Spence of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee said at midnight: "We
will carry the State by i>o,uoo, and will
make good gains in the Legislature. "
The Republicans claim that in the Leg
islative contests they have gained two or
three members to add to their majority
In the Senate, while in the House their
great majority will be Increased by seven
or eight. Cummins said:
"The percentage of majority for the Re
publican party is as large as the party
has ever had. It could not Â¦well be great
er. I am well gratified at the result."
Connecticut Names Delegates.
NEW HAVEN, Nov. s.â Connecticut to
day chose delegates to the first constitu
tional convention to be held in the State
since 1818. Of the 168 towns in the State
165 have been heard from, showing that
Republican delegates were elected in 105,
Democrats in 44 and Citizen or Non-Parti
san candidates in 18. Two cities of the
State. Ansonia and Bridgeport, held city
elections and surprises developed in both
cases. In Ansonia Stephen Charters, can
didate of the Democratic and Labor party,
was chosen Mayor by a majority unusual
there. In Bridgeport the Democrats also
scored a notable victory.
Republicans Rule Rhode Island.
PROVIDENCE. R. 1.. Nov. 5--In thÂ«
election of Governor Gregory and the en
tire ticket by a plurality of at least 6000
the Republicans of Rhode Island, with %
majority in both branches of the General
Assembly, have again retained the guid
ance of the State's policy. The Democrats
cut down by 3000 votes the plurality of the
Republicans in the last election. The
Democrats elected their Mayoralty can
didates by substantial pluralities in Prov
idence, Pawtucket. Woonsocket and New
port and the Republicans were successful
in the city of Central Falls.
Amendments in Pennsylvania.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. s.âPennsylva

THE RIGHT SUPERVISORS.
ALL citizens of San Francisco who desire good
government and who believe that fidelity in
office should be fitly recognized by the people
can congratulate one another this morning upon the
election of Supervisors. A majority of the present
board has been re-elected. These men have most of
them been tried in office and have been found faith
ful and efficient. They have worthily merited the
honor of re-election, which has been accorded them
by their fellow citizens.
For many a year past in the history of San Fran
cisco no party has ever thought of renominating men
who have been tried in the Board of Supervisors.
Neither would it have happened that the voters would
have re-elected any former board for a long time past.
In fact, each succeeding board, until the present one
took office, seems to have been a little worse than its
predecessor. Year after year there were stories of
the "solid nine." and scandals of their jobbery and
corruption. With a few notable and honored excep
tions the career of a Supervisor was limited to one
term of office, during which time he made as much
as he could for his own pocket and then retired to
the obscurity from which he had been brought by the
bosses who gave him the nomination. The excep
tions to that class of men on the board served only to
deepen the disgrace ot the majority, and were pow
erless to redeem them.
With the accession of the present board to office a
change came over that branch of the city government.
They did not satisfy everybody, nor was it possible
for them to do so, but they did satisfy the city at large.
Not a single scandal has arisen during their term of
office. They have never been charged with jobbery
nor suspected of it. Intelligent and fair-minded men
of all parties have perceived that on every issue that
arose the majority of the board has been desirous of
doing what is best for the community as a whole, re
gardless of parties or of special interests. They have
not been subservient to corporations nor have they
been unfair to them. In a word, they have sought al
ways to do right.
To have defeated men of such tried and proven fit
ness for the office of Supervisor would have been in
the nature of a public calamity. It would have been
taken to mean that the people of San Francisco are
indifferent to the honesty of the members of the mu
nicipal legislature. It would have been construed in
some quarters as an indirect approval of the "solid
nine system" of conducting the work of the board,
and the political manipulators of corporation jobbery
would have been quick to take advantage of it.
With the election of the men who were chosen
yesterday the people have assured the continuance of
good government so far as it depends upon the Su
pervisors. The schemes of the corporations to get
control of the board have b?en baffled, and it will
not be in their power to impose extortionate rates
upon the city or upon the people for water or for
gas. The same honest conservatism that has reduced
the rates of those necessary articles in the past will
continue to control the board and shape its policy.
It is not worth while now to point out over again
the evil that would have resulted from the election of
a majority of the candidates for Supervisors named
by the corporations, or those named by the class agi
tators. It is enough to know that the danger was
appreciated by the voters and those candidates have
been defeated. For the present all is well and good.
The right Supervisors have in the main been chosen'
It is time for congratulations.
Wow that the incident is closed and everybody is
filling to forget the wretch and never mention his
Hame, there arises in Boston a gentleman of learn
ing who claims to be familiar with Polish, and says
that if we pronounce Czolgosz as "soldiers" we will
come as near to the Polish pronunciation as it is pos
sible for the Anglo-Saxon tongue to attain.
THE ELECTION OF SOHMITZ.
EVERY indication of the returns from the polling places points to the election of
Mr. Schmitz, the Union Labor candidate, as Mayor of San Francisco. It is not
probable, though of course it is possible, that the official count will change the
result.
The election of Mr. Schmitz follows from causes which will have to be carefully
studied and discussed later on, in order that its full meaning may be understood by the
people. It is almost the only victory achieved by the Union Labor party, for with few
exceptions every candidate supported by The Call was elected. The meaning of the suc
cess of Schmitz will be dealt with later on, for it has a moral that should not be over
looked.
Since he has been made the choice of the voters the Mayor-elect deserves and
will have the respect due to his office. It will remain with him to prove himself worthy
of it. I
Though he has been defeated, the friends of Mr. Tobin salute him with undimin
is"hed respect. He stood for the welfare of the whole community and declared the whole
creed of municipal government. \,
Of course we regret that our advice was not followed. We regret that the ma
jority bisected itself into two minorities. We regret that the Republican primary gave to
the bosses the power to elect Schmitz. We regret that the so-called Republican ticket
had Platitude for its head, Plunder for its tail. But we do not regret that we sounded
the alarm as each process leading to this result was unfolded, and we declare that the
new class government will be impartially treated by us, and rebuked in its fury and com
mended in its wisdom, if it have any. San Francisco will survive the injury and cast off
the burden. , Â¦
THE PAN-AMERICAN- CONGRESS.
PRESIDENT DIAZ in his address of welcome
at the banquet given in the C^ of Mexico
to the delegates of the Pan-American Congress
said: "I express the hope that the conclusion of our
high deliberations may be of such a degree fruitful in
benefits for the people of this continent that their fu
ture relations may ever be governed by the upright
spirit which animated Washington, Hidalgo, Bolivar
and San Martin in the most momentous and charac
teristic episodes of their heroic and public careers."
In reply the temporary president of the congress,
Gonaro Ralgosa, said that the delegates to the con
vention will have no other aim than "to contribute
to the consolidation and sovereignty of the different
states, each one in its own limits, and to promote
the free and progressive development of democratic
institutions in America on the footing of the most
ample recognition of one another's rights."
Banquet speeches are always bright and pleasing.
It is not to be expected that the delegates of the
various countries represented at the congress in Mex
ico will live up to the promise of the glowing words
of Diaz and Ralgosa. Still a great deal may be ex
pected in the way of benefits to the whole of Latin
America as well as to ourselves. As was expected,
Chile has proven to be the most troublesome factor
in the congress. Almost as soon as business was be
gun a resolution was presented by the delegates from
Argentina expressing the hope of the congress that
the dispute between Venezuela and Colombia might
be settled by amicable and fraternal agreement. The
Chileans at once took alarm and opposed the resolu
tion on the ground that it intimated that the con
gress is in favor of retroactive arbitration, a policy
to which the Chilean Government has more than
once declared it will not submit.
The attitude of Chile is the more provoking be
cause the Chileans are decidedly the most enterpris
ing, the most aggressive and most potent population
in South America. They represent a stronger feel
ing of nationality than any other people, and by rea
son of that spirit they exert an influence altogether
out of proportion to their numbers or their wealth.
It seems to be conceded that Chilean co-operation
must be had in order to make any programme of
work adopted by the congress effective. Conse
quently tact has to be exercised all along the line.
It is better to obtain something surely than to strive
to obtain too much and involve the congress in con
troversies that will break it up and render all its
efforts futile.
It would seem, then, that the hope of obtaining
the establishment of a system of arbitration to settle
disputes between American countries will have to be
abandoned for the present. There may be expected,
however, much in the way of work that will promote
trade and commerce. It is evident that a majority of
the delegates are animated by a sincere desire to pro
mote amity and friendship among the nations and
the peoples whom they represent, and as a result
there is sure to come enough of good to justify the
expectation of a greater good to follow when the
spirit of pan-Americanism becomes more generally
infused among the various peoples.
Lombroso. the famous Italian expert in crimin
ology, is reported to have said in a lecture in Paris a
few days ago that the Czar of Russia is "merely an
amiable and melancholy idiot and not a criminal luna
tic." that King Edward is a "general degenerate of
mediocre intelligence, incapable of sound thinking,"
and that the Emperor of Germany is an "irrespon
sible and irretrievable criminal, a brawler who would
have gone to jail and died on a scaffold had he not
been saved by the accident of being born to a
throne." It will be perceived that as a lecturer Sig
nor Lombroso is desirous of making a sensation and
making it quickly.
Mr. Chamberlain's latest utterance on the war in
South Africa is that it is "not over the question of
franchises, but on the issue whether Briton or Boer
shall be predominant." The statement is frank, and it
is to be noted the Boers are apparently just as willing
to fight it out on that basis as on any other.
In a recent interview Sir Thomas Lipton was asked
if he would again challenge for the America's cup,
and replied: "Nobody ever saw me. put on my coat
in the middle of a fight, and the fight for that cup is
only begun. I certainly mean to have another try
for it. Maybe several."
Curiously enough, General Duller has become the
popular hero of the London music-halls, and the

It was announced some time ago that Roosevelt's
message to Congress would be short, but ever since
there have been coming from Washington report
after report of the things he is going to say, so the
chances are it will not be short enough to startle any
body.
A Eastern investigator announces that if men would

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1901.
ONCE upon a time it was believed by good
people that trade tended to friendly rela
tionships among men and nations, and that
the development of an epoch when commerce would
be the dominant factor in civilization would be equi
valent to bringing in the dawn of universal peace.
Perhaps there are a few persons who still hold to that
theory, but the majority of men have learned its false
ness. Many a war has been occasioned by the rival
ries of commerce, and now we are threatened with
another, for the controversy in which the French and
the Turks are engaged is the direct outcome of the
expansion of French enterprise, industry and trade.
French capitalists have been engaged in financing
certain railways in Turkey, and a French company
has a concession for constructing quays and docks
at Constantinople. The French financiers claim that
they have not been repaid the loans they made to the
railways, nor even the interest. One of these com
panies alone claims that the amount due it, with un
paid interest, is nearly $9,000,000. The company
holding the docks and quays concession claims that it
is neither permitted to go on with its work nor of
fered a fair sum to surrender the concession and turn
over to the Turkish Government the work that has
been thus far constructed.
In his address the other day M. Delcasse, Foreign
Minister of France, said: "The Government inter
vened in the quays question in order to get Turkey
to fulfill her engagements. If the Government had
not done so there would have been an end of the nu
merous enterprises which France had created in Tur
key in the shape of railroads, roads, lighthouses and
banks. The debt had been reduced by a large per
centage, and the Porte in August agreed to give sat
isfaction, but on the morrow these arrangements
were forgotten and others were proposed. Our Min
ister then ceased official relations with the Porte.
There was no ultimatum, but the cessation of rela
tions indicated that the Government took the Porte's
word seriously, and that it intended that the engage
ments entered into should be respected."
Of course along with the fight to enforce commer
cial engagements there goes also the invariable ten
dency to represent it as a fight for a higher civili
zation. In this case the claim is well made. It does
not seem possible that there can ever be a worse civil
ization than that which the Turks have imposed upon
the people who have fallen under their empire.
Should the controversy with France lead up to open
war, and that war spread until it brings about some
thing like a revolution in Turkey, the results could
hardly make affairs worse than they are now.
Despite the justice of the French claims, it must
be admitted that the Sultan is not altogether to blame
for delaying to satisfy them. It is said he dare not
give the quays fcack into the hands of the French for
fear of assassination, and at the same time cannot
obtain money to pay for them. He is therefore in a
position that would lead almost any man to equivo
cate and evade. Now that France has taken steps to
compel him to act \ve may be approaching the end
of the condition of affairs which has enabled the
Turks to play fast and loose with civilization for a
century. The concert of Europe may prevent the
outbreak of a war, but when once France has forced
the hand of the Sultan other nations will assert an
equal right to enforce their claims and the old order
of things in Turkey will have come to a close.
The bicentennial anniversary of the grant of the
original charter to the city of Philadelphia occurred
on October 25, but no effort was made to celebrate
the event. One of the reasons given by the press of
the city for permitting the day to pass unnoted is
that "no respectable citizen could afford to identify
himself with a celebration under a Mayor who has
fouled the good name of the city and sunk its affairs
to the lowest pitch of infamous corruption." It will
be seen that during the 200 years of its life the city
of brotherly love has got a long way from where
it started.
Grover Cleveland has made a little speech to the
public and stated a conviction that there are too
many people in this country who think only of get
ting rich. Probably he believes it would be better if
more men would go fishing, and stay at it longer
when they start.
Mr. Edwin Mead, a New England authority, has re
cently predicted that some day Ireland will be a State
in the American Union, but he neglected to complete
the prediction by foretelling whether the new State
would take its stand in the Republican or Democratic
column.
This century is hardly old enough to have made a
record for itself, and yet one can already note a ten
dency on the part of orators to refer to the nineteenth
century as a crude and uncultured epoch in our his
tory.
It has been suggested by a learned man that the
wireless telegraphy now coming into use shall be
called ethergraphy, but the chances are the man of
the street will be content to call it "wireless."
The elections are over, the Schley court of inquiry
is about to wind up its talk, the rainy season is at
hand and everybody feels in a humor for Thanks

FRANCE AND TURKEY.
TWO LIVES ARE SAVED BY HEROIC
ACTS OF YOUNG GIRL AND BOY
AN Incandescent lamp exploding
and a live wire dropping Into a
pile of fluffy feathers started a
fire yesterday afternoon on the
second floor of E. R. Sullivan" 3
pillow and mattress factory at 244 Steven
son street. In a trice the flames devoured
the flimsy material and breaking through
the windows mounted the four stories of
the brick building, consuming everything
combustible.
Arthur Jenkins, an employe, gave the
alarm. Girls and men were warned and
while the flames darted out of the build
ing in fiery sheets all the employes save
three escaped by the staircase exit. So
quickly did the flames spread that three
young women, two on the third floor,
and the other on the fourth, were pre
vented from escaping down the stairs. On
the third floor were Miss Nellie Healy
and Delia McGrath. But one hope was
left for themâ the fire escape.
Down on the street the crowd gathered
from all directions. In a moment the real
ization came upon the excited spectators
that the building was not entirely freed
from human beings. The faces of two
girls at the -windows on the third story
brought terror Into the hearts of all.
Shouts came from below "The fire es
cape, the fire escape."
And while the shouts were still ringing
in the air a young girl appeared at the
fourth floor platform of the fire escape.
Down she came as fast as her feet could
carry her and a great shout of joy rose
upward from, the crowd.
Delia McGrath on the third floor next
followed the suggestion of the fire escape.
She climbed out on the platform and came
down step by step as fast as her inter
fering skirts would permit. Fifteen feet
from the ground the tire escape was cut
off and from that point to the pavement
was a clean drop. But there was a pipe
running from the ground along the entire
length of the escape and Miss McGrath
made use of this to steady herself. In
another second all would be safe. Over
come with the heat and the excitement
she fell when close enough to the ground
to avoid any serious Injury.
Boy Hero on the Scene.
A great cheer went up from the crowd
and willing hands carried Miss McGrath
off to safety. Hardly had the applause
died away when another figure appeared
on the escape. This was Nellie Healy.
For a moment she appeared dumfounded,
as the flames bursting out of the win

DARING RESCUE OF A GIRL FROM THE FIRE THAT GUTTED THE

dows seemed to reach toward that very
part of the iron ladder on which she stood.
The crowd hung breathless below, expect
ing to see her fall at any moment.
Suddenly a boy of small, lithe stature
broke through the pack of people In the
street and began to climb the iron pipe
to the flre escape. Some one appeared as
suddenly with a ladder and with quick,
cool judgment the boy, Frank Gorman by
name, swung from the pipe to the ladder.
HÂ© clambered up to the girl like a sea
soned sailor. Just as he reached her she
was about to fall. When she felt Gor
man's protecting arm she steadied her
self and both came down the ladder to
gether. At the end of the escape Gorman
passed Miss Healy to Bernard Cappel,
who in turn carried her to the ground,
safe, but badly scorched. Then Miss Healy
fainted.
Gorman, who played the part of a hero,
Is thoroughly unconscious of his brave
act. All the time he bore the burden
down the escape ladder rung by rung the
fierce shafts of flame skirted his descent.
Miss Healy's face and arms were badly
burned and Gorman's left arm is blistered.
The young lady was carried at once to the
drug store on the corner of Stevenson and
Third streets, where her Injuries received
immediate attention.
Nellie Healy's Heroic Act.
Frank Gorman is but 19 years of age
and lives at I*4 Preclta avenue. At pres
ent he is one of the striking riveters, a
mere apprentice at his trade, and is out
of work. Two years ago he completed a
course at the Naval Training School,
where he acquired his agility and nimble

It is the above facts coupled with an
editorial from the U. S. Health Reports
that have at last compelled the regular
medical profession to accept Hyomei, the
new dry air germicide, as their only hope
of stamping out these diseases.
This editorial, published January stli,
1900, says: "No other treatment or rem-
edy has had anything whatever to do
with bringing about this reduction."
Probably not over half of these people
were cured of the disease consumption it-
self, but as coughs, catarrh and bronchitis,
which furnish nine-tenths of all the vic-
tims of consumption, cannot exist where
Hyomei is used, Hyomei by reducing the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1901.
the port of Syra and received from the
telegraph station a batch of dispatches
containing definite instructions from the
French Government regarding carrying
out of the sealed orders, which were hand
ed to the admiral previous to his leaving
Toulon. These dispatches directed Ad
miral Caillard to proceed to the island
of Mitylene, where he will seize the cus
toms of Midilli, and at another port.
The Foreign Office here has not yet re
ceived the Sultan's reply to the note pre
sented by M. Bapst, Counselor oÂ£ the
French legation, following out the in
structions of M. Delcasse of the Foreign
Office, under date of November 4. The
correspondent here of the Associated
Press is enabled to make the following
statement:
France Acts Cautiously.
"When the French Government decided
to send a French squadron to Turkey it
debated whether to seize the customs at
Salonica, Beirout or Smyrna, as it was
realized that the receipts of one of these
three big ports would be required to pro
duce a sufficient sum to pay off the
French claims without a long occupation,
which was considered inadvisable. The
occupation of Salonica was at once dis
missed, because it might create the false
impression that France was aiming to re
open the Macedonian question. The occu
pation of Beirout was also set aside, ow
ing to the French position and interests,
and Smyrna, where the population looks
upon France as a protector. The occu
pation of Boirout was certain to produce
offense and perhaps even rebellion. The
choice of M. Delcasse. consequently, fell
on Smyrna, which offers equal advan
tages to the other ports, without their
political drawbacks. Saturday, however,
came the dispatch from M. Bapst, an
nouncing the issuance of the Sultan's
irade accepting the Lorando claim in its
entirety, as France demanded. This dis
patch slightly modified the aspect of the
situation, inasmuch as M. Delcasse came
to the conclusion that the Sultan would
now settle the money claims and would,
within a few days, produce guarantees
which France demanded for their pay
ment.
Expect Sultan to Settle.
"The necessity for seizing big customs,
therefore, became less pressing, although
the necessity for occupying Turkish ter
ritory_ in order to exercise pressure and
compel the Sultan to concede the demands
respecting Turkey's disregard of French
treaty rights, still remained urgent. The
Government, therefore, decided that Ad
miral Caillard should occupy a couple of
ports on the island of Mitylene, which is
conveniently close to Smyrna. It is the
Government's impression that the Sultan
will satisfactorily settle the monetary
question should the customs recipts
prove not sufficient to satisfy the French
demands, and Smyrna can yet be occupied
In the meantime the occupation of the
ports of the island of Mitylene is more
convenient from a military point of view
as the French cannot easily be disturbed,
whereas, Smyrna, being on the main
land, its occupation might have more
serious results than desired. The French
Government, however, trusts that Hie
whole controversy will shortly be ar
ranged to its satisfaction, and hopes
that the treaty stipulations will be carried
out by the issue of irades, such as giving
certain French schools permission to in
struct, which thus far has been withheld,
and also by giving official recognition
throughout the Turkish empire to di
plomat lsued by the French medical fac
ulty at Beirout, etc."
Admiral Caillard Reports.
Following is the dispatch received from.
Admiral Caillard: "
"MITYLENE, Nov. 4. 11:40 a. m.-Ar
mored division arrived at Mitylene."
The dispatch does not mention any in
cident atending the landing, but it seems
certain that the French commander car
ried out his instructions, which were to
occupy three ports of the island and to
seize the customs.
One cruiser and three torpedo catchers
got separated from the squadron, owing
to the speed of the latter. The dispatch
boat, Mouette, which had joined the
squadron, was sent to meet them and to
accompany them to Mitylene.
America Watches Events.
WASHINGTON, Nov. s.â The seizure of
the Turkish island of Mitylene by France
may result in the collection of customs
from American ports in part satisfaction
of the French claims. To what extent
American commerce figures in the trade
of Mitylene the State Department is not
advised, but the fact that a consular
agent is maintained there is an im
portant indication that American goods
are imported into the island. While
American interests are not immediately
affected by the action of the French Gov
ernment, the dangerous complications
which may arise have undoubtedly caused
the authorities to look into the future and
consider what this Government shall do
in certain eventualities.
Secretary Hay and Embassador Choate
during their conferences to-day undoubt
edly referred to the Franco-Turkish ques
tion. The time is not yet ripe for the
United States to even formulate a policy
of action. France, it is believed, was
moved to adopt her present belligerent at
titude because of the fact that England's
hands are tied in South Africa. Even
should the Sultan appeal to Great Britain
to lend her assistance In the preservation
of his Asiatic territory, the London Gov
ernment would prefer to rely upon diplo
matic protests rather than force. Ger
many's interests in Northern Syria are
such that she would object to Turkish
partition unless she received proper rec
ognition. The possibility of a European
war is never lost sight of by the authori
ties and such an advent would naturally
deeply affect American interests. For this
reason it is proposed to keep a sharp
watch on developments now that the
French have gone so far as to seize ter
ritory. This Government has no desire to
force itself into European affairs and for
this reason the State Department has not
asked the Navy Department to send a
ship to the Eastern Mediterranean.
SULTAN RECOGNIZES
AN AMERICAN CONSUL
TJncle Sam's Representative at Har
put Has His Exequatur For
mally Conferred.
WASHINGTON, Nov. s.â The State De
partment has been informed that the
Turkish Government has issued an ex
equatur to Dr. Thomas Herbert Norton,
United States Consul at Harput, Turkey!
who was appointed to that position in
June, 1900. Dr. Norton has been without
the authority of the Porte to perform his
functions for nearly a year and a half
However, through the energetic efforts of
Lloyd Griscom, formerly United States
Charge d'Affaires at Constantinople, he
has been discharging informally for some
months past his regular functions in lieu
of the formal conferring of his exequatur
Turkey objected to the establishment of
an American Consul at Harput on the
ground that there was no commerce at
that place, but a short time ago Turkey
permitted the British Government to es
tablish a consulate at Harput and the
United States renewed its efforts to se
cure Dr. Norton's exequatur.

FUGITIVE PRESIDENT
OF BANK SENDS OFFER
Agrees to Return Misapplied Funds
if Criminal Proceedings Be
Dismissed.
NEW WHATCOM, Wash., Nov. s.âDe
positors of the defunct Scandinavian-
American Bank of this city have received
an offer* of settlement from Its fugitive
president, H. St. John, otherwise known
as Dix, who last January absconded after
looting it of every cent of deposits and
taking a goodly share of the money pom
in for its capital stock, more than $25,000
all told. The offer came in a letter de
livered to-day to Receiver Muir by a man
whose identity the receiver was pledged
in advance not to disclose.
The fugitive says that if the depositors
will sign an agreement to dismiss all
pending criminal and civil proceedings
against himself and other officers and di
rectors of the looted Institution he will
make a cash payment of 25 per cent of
their claims and payment of the remain
ing 75 per cent in quarterly payments, all
to be paid within one year.
The letter is believed to have come from
South Africa. St. John says that Cashier
Oleson and a former attorney for the
bank, S. M. Bruce, are with him.
ACCUSES HER
OF MORE CRIME
Massachusetts Chief of
Police Tells of Top
pan Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Nov. 5.-Chlef WadÂ© of the
State Police said to-day that Nurse Jane
Toppan, now awaiting a hearing on a
charging of poisoning Mrs. Mary D. Gibbs
at Cataumet last August, had been un
der suspicion before the four people com
prising the Davis household were taken
ill. He added that while the newspapers
had commenced with the deaths at Catau
met and traced Miss Toppan in Loweil
and Cambridge, the authorities had their
attention attracted to a case in Middle
sex County and after inveatigating the
nurse's life in that county they had been
led to Cataumet shortly after the death,
of Mrs. Davis.
Chief Wade said that Detective Whit
ney commenced an inquiry during the
early summer at the request of District
Attorney Weir, who had reason to believe
that one of Miss Toppan's patients had
not died from natural causes. For weeks
he followed the cases Miss Toppan had
treated in Cambridge and Lowell and was
accumulating a great deal of evidence cal
culated to confirm the belief that there
was something wrong about the nurse' 3
methods.
While Weir and Whitney were in the
midst of their investigation in Middle
sex County Mrs. Davis died in Cambridge
a-nd Miss Toppan went to Cataumet.
Chief Wade then advised Whitney, who
was the only officer familiar with what
had been done, to go to the Cape and
learn what he could find there about the
nurse, at the same time keeping track of
her movements.
CHARLES COLLIER JR.

SAN DIEGO, Nov. s.â The announce

candidacy of Charles Collier Jr. of this
city for the Republican nomination for
Congress in this district. Mr. Collier de
nies that he has ever said that he was a
candidate, but will not speak so stoutly
in reply to a question as to whether he
will be in the future.
The district is unrepresented at present
â that is. Congressman Needham, who re
ceived his support from most of the coun
ties of this district, does not now reside
within its boundaries, his county having
been joined with San Joaquin County In
another district. This ground is therefore
considered open to all candidates and Mr
Collier's friends have been urging him to
enter the lists.

TRIBAL FIGHT AMONG
INDIANS NEAB SITKA
Adoption of the Frog as a Family Em
blem Leads to a Clash, of
the Natives.
PORT TOWNSEND, Nov. 5.â A severe
windstorm has prevailed all day on the
straits of San Juan de Fuca and oft Cape
Flattery, causing delay to shipping. This
morning the revenue cutter Bear started
for Comox^ B. C. to coal before sailing
Â£"*. San Francisco, but after reaching
Â»l"i t^. llson returned and remained her*
until this evening.
A tribal fight between Indians residing
near Sitka, which a few months ago near
ly precipitated riot and bloodshed, has
been settled by the courts, according to
advices from Sitka. The trouble com
menced over one tribe using the frog as
a family emblem and engraving a frog on
an immense totem pole erected at the en
trance of their village. Members of an
other tribe that for generations had
claimed the frog as its emblem gathered
in large numbers and proceeded to de
molish the totem of the offending tribe.

In the orfrans themselves is quite clear and
full, but how these changes operate on the
nerves and spinal cord center are mysteries to
the medical profession. Whatever the morbid
change may be. however, the effects are ap-
parent in the embarrassed sufferer; these '
troubles being symptomatic of the above men-
tioned and well-defined morbid conditions, it -
seems that even the unprofessional patient
must understand that stomach drugging will
not cure, but efforts directed toward repairing
the damaged tract will restore. In practice
such is the case, as the treatment on these
lines never fails to accomplish the desired re-
sult. Colored chart of the organs sent on ap-

Contracted Blood Disorders,

Treatment.
After ten years' use of this method we hayÂ«
had no reason to change: on the contrary, our
belief increases daily from reports of patients
treated who have married and suffered no re-
lapse. It offers the following advantages, via.:
Saves time for the physician and patient, as
well as labor, office visits being rendered Infre-
quent. Besides, little change Is necessary in
diet or habits of life, the disease is readily
concealed and permanent cure is effected in
a short time; the stomach is not drugged, and
the precise dosage is obtainable. The expense
also is greatly reduced.
Contracted Disorders.
Under the treatment pursued before irriga-
tions were established six weeks was deemed
the duration of an acute contracted disorder.
If it proceeded beyond six weeks It was con-
sidered to have gone into chronic condition.
From statistics compiled from our practice in ?
the past five years, covering over &JOO cases, we
can show thai 90 per cent of our patients have .
recovered in fourteen days or lees. It 13 there-
fore equally proper to hold that a case not en-* I
tirely cured within two weeks must be con-: Â¦
sidered a chronic one, and some complication
has arisen for which the patient should see a
I specialist. We invite free consultation on this
subject, and offer an experience of over twenty
years; in fact, we can positively assert that'
we have never failed to cure in a single ts>Â»

RIVAL COLLEGES MAKING FINAL SELECTION OF MEN FOR FOOTBALL TEAMS
BOTH ELEVENS SHOW IMPROVEMENT
ON THE FIELD IN THEIR PRACTICE
Bert Oliver, Former Reliance Guard, Will Referee the Big
Game Saturday, Dr. Walter E. Garrey, a Former
Chicago Player, Being Umpire â Ax Rally at Berkeley
AT BERKELEY OVERALL, THE RIGHT GUARD ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL ELEVEN,
DEVOTES ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PRACTICING PLACE KICKING FROM THE FIELD. THIS IS THE
PLAY WITH WHICH STANFORD WON THE INTERCOLLEGIATE GAME LAST YEAR.
BERKELEY, Nov. 6.â The Califor
nia football eleven scored three
touchdowns against the scrub
team this afternoon, redeeming
itself In a measure for the poor
showing; it made yesterday. Much spirit
was shown by the varsity, and although
the second eleven played a gritty game It
was unable to stop the bucks through its
line and the runs around Its ends for long:
and repeated gain*. Practice lasted
twenty minutes.
The line-up of the big eleven showed al
most to a man those who will play Satur
day. Gendotti was back at center and
Overall and Albertson were in their po
sitions oi right guard and left tackle, re
tpcctively. Stow is undoubtedly out of
the game said Freshman Stroud now holds
his place at left guard. Braly is also out,
Hansen having secured right tackle. Starr
played left end and Hudson right end.
More played quarter, Womble right half
and Mini left half. As Duden is etill suf
fering from bruises Hamilton was put in
at full. The line-up in the Intercollegiate
will take in the men who were on the
gridiron this afternoon, excepting Hamil
ton. There will be some shifts in posi
tions. More cannot last through a i big
game. Il.j<Jfon in that event will go to
quarter. . Womble to end and W hippie to
half. Starr and Dlbblee will both play at
left end.
In to-night's play Womble made two
touch-downs and Overall one. But one at
tempt was made to kick a goal, More
sending the ball between the posts with
precision. The men had no lack of
coaches. Besides Simpson and Hopper
there were on the field Prescott Scott and
George Cadwalader, old Yale men, and
Clay, Kerfoot, Thane and Whipple,
former college players.
To-morrow will be the last day of heavy
practice. Thursday and Friday the men
will run through the signals, the closing
work being done in secret.
The famous Stanford ax. which was
captured two years ago by Berkeley root
enÂ» ( will be brought to the gridiron to
morrow afternoon at the beginning of
practice. The rooters will assemble at the
gymnasium at 4 o'clock and In procession
will inarch to the field. They will be led
by the college band and by Football Cap
tain Womble, who will carry the ax.
Womble' s successor a 6 custodian of the
ax will be elected and an ax rally held.
On Thursday evening a smoker will take
place in the gymnasium. Among the
speakers will be Dr. G. C. Pardee, J. R.
Glascock, W T . R. Davis, Frank Powers,
Professor T. R. Bacon, Professor W. A
Setchell, E. E. Harris, W r . E. Creed, J. W.
S. Butler and J. H. Steinhart. A quartet
from the Medical College will sing.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 5.â
The air was just right for hard work on
the gridiron to-night, and the two elevens
"mixed" things vigorously. The secon-1
team repeated last night's performance
by plowing through the varsity line time
after time, at one time bucking the var
sity nearly the length of the field before
losing the ball.
However, during the greater part of the
practice the bis team demonstrated clear
ly its superiority. The men appeared
somewhat erratic, at times playing star
ball and frequently being exceedingly
ragged in their work. The coaches are
trying a number of different men for
nearly every nosition on the varsity, so
the line-up for the big game seems to be
by no means decided. To-night Smith and
Allen were played at ripht half, and both
showed well, especially on end runs.
Smith at one time getting loose for twen
ty-five yardÃ around left end. Roosevelt
was tried at left tackle on the varsity,
playing the position creditably, at times
even brilliantly, scoring a touchdown on
a thirty-yard run around right end. Van
Sirkle was substituted at right guard for
Barnhisel. showing up well, particularly
in smashing up interference. Lee played
varsity center during the entire practice
to-night.
Cooper Clark, Tarpey. Preston and
Butterfleld were all given a chance at
playing end positions this evening. It Is
hard to choose the best two men of the
bunch, but Cooper would certainly be one
of them. Tarpey distinguished himself by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1901.
a brilliant run of sixty yards around left
end for a touchdown. This was the most
spectacular feature of the practice, and
the stocky freshman captain showed he
knew how to give the "straight arm," for
he left several would-be tacklers in his
wake.
"Guiby" Dole, fullback on the second,
and Dougherty, right half, played in
varsity form, going through for good
gains repeatedly.
Treasurer Edwards to-night announced
that Dr. Walter E. Garrey, a former Chi
cago player, will officiate as umpire in
the intercollegiate game, while Beit
Oliver, former Reliance guard, will re'
eree. Dave Brown, Stanford '97, and Ev
erett Brown, California, will be the time
keepers, and J. T. Nourse, Stanford '99.
and Clay, California, linesmen.

soon as he took up his daily gymnasium
work. After playing handball he punch
ed the bag. In the midst of his exercise
he told Trainer Billy Delaney he felt lazy
and thought he would do no more indoor
work that day. Jeff said he had visited
a neighboring spring Sunday and sam
pled all the waters to be found within a
radius of two miles, and as a result grew
heavier. In order to take off the extra
weight and return to his normal condi
tion, the champion donned heavy clothing
in the afternoon and went on the road.
"Kid" Eagan drove a fast horse to pace
the big fellow. Jeffries returned three
hours later soaked through and through
with perspiration. After being rubbed
down with coarse towels, Jim mounted
the scales and, much to his satisfaction,
tipped the beam at 214^. pounds. He felt
proud of his achievement of taking off
twelve pounds in an afternoon.
Jeff is satisfied with his condition. He
says he proved to his own satisfaction
yesterday afternoon that he was in shape.
He told his training mates he had the
endurance and strength to go a great
distance and all he needed now was
greater speed: that in future he would
eschew all beverages, and would go into
the gymnasium with a view to getting
speed.
It seems almost impossible for Jim to
become any faster on his feet. In hand
ball he skips around the alley with the
speed of a lightweight. When boxing he
moves fast and never tires. Delaney is
glad Jim is to give up road work. He
feels that it will do his protege harm if
he does too much of this kind of train
ing. Delaney likes to see the champion
box speedily and take exercise that will
fit him "or a fast pace.
No Wrestling for Jeffries.
Jeff seems to have the utmost confi
dence that he can handle Ruhlin despite
his great size and bulk. Sim. is a giant
in strength, and therefore takes it for
granted that Gus will not be able to bus
tle him around the ring or act badly in
the clinches. He has therefore taken no
wrestling exercise. Fitzsimmons, Corbett
and others always had a heavy wrestler
in camp they could haul around at will.
Jeff does not do this, because he has had
little trouble handling opponents who
tried to hang on or act roughly in the
clinches. In his memorable battle with
Sharkey in the Pavilion at San Francisco
some years ago the sailor tried to rough
it. Jeffries did not like tuis style of light
ing and wanted to break clean. Tom,
however, continued his tactics, and the
next time he tried to throw Jeff around
the champion grabbed him by the arms
and Shook the "marine" as he would a
misbehaving child. Sharkey quickly dis
continued this style of fighting. It was
then that ring goers marveled at Jeff's
great strength.
The big fellow is a pleasant sight to
look upon. He is the picture of health
and he walks with a briskness that de
notes strength and agility. ills skin is
tanned and is as velvety as a babe's. His
muscles are supple, yet as hard as iron
when contracted. His legs are like col
umns of stone. Colonel Fuiton J. Berry
of Fresno, who is staying in camp,
watched the big- fellow move toward the
gymnasium to-day and he confidently
told Brother Jack that as soon as Jim
was through fighting he would borrow
the fighter's underpinning for his piano.
Jim's eyes are as clear as crystals. In
handball he rarely misses a stroke; in
boxing he seems to see every move his
opponent makes, and in shooting at a
mark or a bird he invariably makes a
bullseye. He has been in these moun
tains now nearly two months and the air
and surroundings have fitted him to enter
the arena ready to go any distance at any
pace.
Delaney's Views on the Hen.
Billy Delaney was asked to-day to give
his views to The Call on the men who
will soon battle for the championship.
The veteran trainer reluctantly did so,
because he is averse to talking for pub
lication. He prefers to let his work show
in the ring. However, he spoke as fol
lows:
"Jeffries possesses qualifications that no
other fighter his weight enjoys. He is the
heaviest pugilist the world has ever pro
duced. He can run as fast, if not faster
than any man his weight. He can hit In
proportion to his weight. In fact, he can
deal a knockout punch with either hand.
It has been proven conclusively that the
champion is a glutton for punishment.
There is no doubt about his gameness.
His record in half a dozen battles has
proven he has determination and courage.
In all his fights he has shown that he pos
sesses endurance. The longer the route
the stronger he appears to be.
"Jeff went to work in the iron foundry
whan a boy and his training has stood
him in good stead. I have always had a
theory that there is no pasture for a colt
like hilly pasture and Jeffries' early train-
Ing bears this out.
"Jeffries is but human and has his lit
tle vices, but unlike the many of his fel
low-men he does not carry his vices to
excess. Jim is not of an excitable nature.
He does not lose his head when he has
his man whipped. He does not rush in to
give the finishing blow, but like the care
ful ring general he is, he awaits his op
portunity and then lands. In my opinion
Jeffries is the fairest fighter that ever
stepped Inside the ropes. Although not a
Corbett in regard to cleverness, he pos
sesses a style of his own and manages
to hit his opponent, no matter how shifty
he may be.
"As to this match with Ruhlinâ l was
always opposed to it because I consider
Gus to be the most dangerous man in the
heavyweight division. As for Ruhlin â he
is also young, strong, clever in his own
way and has a heart in proportion to his
body. I mean by that that Ruhlin can
take a beating. If there is any yellow in
his composition it has never come to the
surface. His twenty-round draw with
Jeffries must not be overlooked. It Is true
that both were inexperienced, but they
were on even terms. Their progress has
been rapid and the question to be decided
is, "Who has made the most of his op
portunities?' Both men have had fine
training quarters and every opportunity
to get in condition. Ruhlin is In good
hands and if either man goes to the post,
out of condition he has no one to blame
but himself."
RUHLIN BEFORE THE CAMERA.
Goes Through Training Exercises in
Front of Moving Picture Machine.
When Gus Ruhlin awoke yesterday
morning he thought he saw before him a
comparatively restful day, but before he
got through with Photographer Burns,
representing the Edison Company. Gus
found that doi/fg training stunts before a
moving piGture machine was not as soft
a Job as he thought it would be. It is
quite certan he will hereafter consider the
moving picture man a synonym for hard
work. For two hours Ruhlin worked out
before the camera. He did not omit a
single training stunt.
The camera was set up on the road
outside Blanken's, and Gus did all his
work in the open air. He went through
it with his usual snap and vim. It was
not a mere show-off before a camera,
but a sesslqn of hard training. Ruhlin
cut out his usual road work, but gave

OUT A HEAD FOR THE HANDICAP
San Venado Takes the Opening Event at Oakland â Heavily
Played at Short Odds, Obia Runs A\yay From Her Field.
Gibraltar Succeeds in Earning a Pair of Brackets
JOCKEY WINNIE O'CONNOR
spoiled an excellent break for the
books at Oakland yesterday, when,
on the favorite Janice, he beat the
outsider Varro a head for the free
handicap. For a time it looked as if the
last named horse had the purse at his
mercy, as he was only galloping with
Waterbury and his light impost of 95
pounds. Meehanus was me runner-up,
but under protest. After none too pleas
ant a voyage from the time of leaving
the seven-furlong post, O'Connor moved
Into third position with Janice In the
stretch. Stealing up under full pressure
of whip and steels, he nailed the two
leaders and in a furious drive got tue
verdict by a head. Varro only beat Mee
hanus a neck, and Waterbury was
blamed for throwing the race away.
However it must be considered, O'Con
nor has had possibly a month or so more
experience than the younger boy. Brutal
started, but was bumped at the start.
Flush of Gold did not make much of a
showing, nor did Sir Dougal.
There was an excellent attendance and
a vast improvement in the betting was
noticeable. Favorites divided honors with
longer priced horses, winning three
events.
Sandy McNaughton's brown horse San
Venado made his introductory bow in the
opening sprint. Even with O'Connor in
the saddle, the ring laid 5 to 1 about San
dy's latest purchase, and he disposed of
Blanche Sheppard, an outsider, by half a
length. McNamara, the favorite, cut off
before reaching the stretch, finished in
the show.
El Oriente, from the Baldwin stable,
could have walked in ahead of the big
bunch starting in the mile selling run,
but injudicious rating landed him fourth.
After moving up into first position from
far back in the rear, Lodestar, piloted by
Burlingame, was nabbed and beaten a
neck by Tony Lepping, a 9 to 1 shot.
Mortgage, the favorite, early had a gen
teel sufficiency of the game.
Royalty appeared minus any sort of
condition in the two-year-old sprint,
which left it an easy mark for Hainault.
Ed Lanigan's youngster closed a 6 to 5
choice and won on the bit from Botany.
The Schorr entry, Commissioner Forester,
ran third.
Quite apparently by the betting on the
mile and a sixteenth selling affair, Fly
ing Torpedo was not ready, and the price
about Obia fell from o to 5 to 7 to 10. Sir

the camera man a shot at him as lie
usually comes In from the road. Then a
race was arranged between RuhUn.
"Denver Ed" Martin and ' Charlie
Goff. While this is not one of the fea
tures of Ruhlin's training it illustrates
his hundred-yard dashes which improve
his wind. All three pugilists were on
their mettle for the race. They got an
even start, but Ruhlin, who was in bet
ter physical shape, won easily. The boys
tried to jolly Ruhlin into the belief that
they could beat him if they were In as
good condition as he is, but Ruhlin called
their defi by offering to bet them any
amount of money he could leave them be
hind In or out of condition. When Gus
told his sparring partners that he could
do 100 yards in twelve seconds they
laughed at him. Ruhlin got a bit net
tled and offered to bet any amount that
he could do the distance in that time
right then and there.
Billy Madden came to Runun s aid and
the argument gave way to a rope-skip
ping exhibition, all of which was taken
in by the camera. Gus performed all his
feats in regulation gymnasium costume.
The most interesting part of the day's
work was the one-round boxing bouts be
tween the Akron fighter and his two
trainers. The first round Ruhlin took on
"Charlie" Goff, who is a fast, clever
fighter. They went at it hammer and
tongs, Ruhlin of course holding back the
full power of his punch.
He banged Goff about the body and
face in clever style and showed a marked
improvement in his boxing. The fact
that he has not done any boxing for
some time made him fast and lively, and
the exhibition was exciting. After the
bout with Goff Ruhlin and "Denver Ed"
Martin went together for a fast round.
They pummeled each other hard and
often, and in this bout Gus exhibited a
remarkable improvement. Those who
have not seen the big Akron fighter han
dle his mitts since he fought "Joe" Ken
nedy here two years ago would be sur
prised at his rapid strides toward per
fection. His delivery and defense have
been strengthened and he looks every
inch a match for Jeffries.
Ruhlin holds himself practically in an
upright position and maintains this po
sion except occasionally, when he as
sumes a slight crouch to block or jab
with his left. In fiddling his man out
Ruhlin keeps both arms switching up and
down between his stomach and jaw,
forming a barricade that the quickest of
boxers would find hard to break down.
This manner of defense Ruhlin claims is
equally as good as the crouch. Instead
of smothering a blow Ruhlin meets it
with his arms and sends it off in another
direction, leaving his opponent open for
a hard counter.
By the time Gus was finished with the
camera man both he and his manager,
Billy Madden, thought it was a full day's
work.

FIND A BODY
IN A BARREL
Chicago Authorities Are
Puzzled Over Mys
terious Crime.
CHICAGO, Nov. s.â The remains of a
man whose head had almost been severed
from his body were discovered in a flour
barrel on a strip of prairie near Rice
street and Western avenue today.
The victim's feet were securely bound in
a gunny sack and the body was doubled,
from which It was apparent that difficulty
had been experienced in forcing It
into the receptacle. Besides the wound
in the neck there was a deep gash on the
man's face.
Roccio Cantre. a saloonkeeper, identified
the body as that of Antonio Napoll. who
left Chicago a year ago and whom Cantre
had not since seen. Napoli was in a party
of twenty-five Italian laborers who
reached Chicago last night from lowa
Center, lowa. Chief of Police O'Neill
suggested that the man had been the vic
tim of a vendetta, as a dollar was found
on the body.
The place where the barrel was found
has been used for years as a dumping
ground. Twelve years ago it furnished
another murder mystery which has never
been cleared up. The victim of this other
crime was Amelia Olsen, a domestic

POSTUM CEREAL.
PARALYSIS AND COFFEE.
Symptoms Disappear When Drug Is
Abandoned.
"Tea and coffee were forbidden by my
phjTrtclan, for I had symptoms of paraly-
sis, and It wu plain that the coffee was
the cause of the trouble. I began using
Postuin Food' Coffee and am now a steady
advertisement for Poetum. The old symp
tome of paralysis disappeared In a very
brief Ume after I began the use of Pos-
tum and quit '_he use of coffee. Do not
use my name publicly, if you please.

CoffÂ«-e is such a direct poison to th-?
nerve centers of many highly organized
people that it produces all sort 3 of disor-
ders, :'rom stomach and bowel troubles,
palpitation of the heart, kidney troubles,
etc., etc., up to more intricate nervous
diseases, auch as paralysis. The way to
Â¦"veil is to leave off coffee or any
Ti destroyer of that sort, and use Pos-
um Food Coffee, which is a direct re-
builder of the nerve centers. Sure and
Vell-d<;nned improvement in health will
follow this course, ac can be proven by

The many friends of Judge William L.
Pierce and Mrs. Honora Sharp will . be
surprised to hear of their marriage, which
was quietly celebrated yesterday after
noon in the presence of only their imme
diate relatives.
Judge Pierce has resided in this city
for the last five years and was formerly a
Judge of the Superior Court of San Diego
County. He was a widower for some
years and is the father of two daughters
Mrs. L. R, Works, wife of a well-known
attorney in San Diego, and Miss Opal
Pierce, who has resided with her father
at 912 Bush street.
Mrs. Honora Sharp was the widow of
the late Attorney George F. Sharp, who
died In 1882. She is possessed of a laree
fortune. George F. Sharp aiÂ»d his brother
Sol Sharp, were pioneer attorneys of Cali
fornia. Reueben H. Lloyd entered their
offices when a young man and secured
considerable of the firm's patronage when
the members passed away.
Judge and Mrs. Pierce left last night
for the East and will be absent two
months.

Herbert C. Porter, who died last Satur

At last, after much perturbation, the men
of the society Florodora sextet have de
cided upon the details of their costume.
It Is to consist of a frock coat, silk hat,
patent leather ties, white spats and a
huge chrysanthemums for a boutonniere.
Yesterday two more boxes were disposed
of. The purchasers were Mrs. Edward
Barron and Miles T. Baird.
Yesterday afternoon the girls of the
sextet met at the residence of Miss Ber
nice Landers and spent the hours in mak
ing the fetching pink boas, which will be
one of the prettiest features of their cos
tumes.
The box holders have also had their
troubles. Naturally it was the dress ques
tion that caused the annoyance. In fact,
what to wear became with them such a
complex problem that many of the box
holders got together to discuss the all
important subject. Finally it was decided
that full evening dress, as for the opera,
would be de rigueur for the opening night.
Saturday night's costume is left to the
discretion of the wearer.
The doll's house is now at Sloane's re
ceiving the careful attention of the men
in the carpet department. When the car
pet layers and furniture makers get
through with it it will probably be the
handsomest doll house ever seen In this
city.

Charity Ball Draws a
Throng of Fash
ionables.
ONCE in many moons one's wildest
dreams apropos a social function
comQ true. Such a realization
was' last night's charity baitâ a
magnificent affair, with nearly
twice as many men as women present.
I do not know how the ladies having the
affair in charge happened to bring Â»botrt
such a delightful state of affairs, but this
I do know, every girl present was de
voutly thankful for it.
I never saw a more elegant gathering
than that one assembled in Golden Gate
Hall last evening. This, too,. In spite of
the fact that many of the girls and a
large number of the men had accepted for
the Dunham ball, to which they managed
to go later in the evening.
This,' the first charity ball for many
many seasons, showed that an affair of
this kind may be altogether exclusive an.l
still yield a large sum for the intended
charity. Tickets for last evening were
sold at $2, and the long list of those pres
ent will make the Children's Hospital
many dollars the richer.
The ladies of the auxiliary, who had
the affair in charge, acted as a reception
committee. They were:
Miss Carolan (president of the auxiliary),
Miss Genevieve Carolan, Mrs. Gus Taylor, Mrs.
Will Taylor, Miss Georglna Hopkins, Mrs. Law

Wonderful Enid Brandt.
A large audience gathered last night at
Sherman & Clay Hall to hear little Enid
Brandt's first recital of this season. The
child has grown amazingly In the last
year, and her difficult programme was
rendered with a technical mastery, a
grasp of her subject that astonfahed and
delighted her hearers. Last year the lit
tle girl's tiny hands could not reach the
octave; this year she plays all the diffl
fiUlt octave work In the "Weber Concert
Stuck without missing a note. In other
ways, too, her technical grasp has broad
ened, her tone deepened, and It is Indeed
difficult to believe, if. one closes one's
eyes, that It Is only a ninevyear-old" child
that is playing. The Weber Concert
Stuck is an extraordinary effort of mem
ory, besides Its other difficulties, but Enid
seemed much more than equal to her
task. Other numbers on the prograrrima
were the Chopin Nocturne In E flat; a
splendid rendering of Mendelssohn's
Spinning Song; "Flatterer" of "Charml
nade," played with an almost comical ma
turity; Thome "Mandoline." Chopin E
Minor Waltz, Mendelssohn's "Rondo
Capriccloso," and two wonderfully clever
little compositions by the gifted child,,
valse "La Petite" and "Danse An
tique." The amusing "Musical Teleg
raphy" experiments were repeated and
aroused anew the wonder of the audi
ence. Little Miss Brandt is to play agafn
on Saturday afternoon next and no one
can afford to miss her.

up." Paterson asked him to come outside.
Menander started to go out and Paterson
struck him. knocking him aown. Menan

knocked down. The third time he got
outside and they started to tight, but

that they will prove fatal. When he was

Dies After Violent Hysteria.
Jack Baker, a laboring man, who was
brought to the Emergency Hospital from
33 Tehama street at midnight Monday
in a state of violent hysteria, died yester
day morning at 11 o'clock. The hospital
physicians were unable to decide the
cause of his death and the body was re
moved to the Morgue, where an autopsy
will be performed to determine the cause
of death.
The swiftest bird known to the natural
ist is either the vulture, which is said to
make 150 miles an hour, or the English
kestril, which can probably equal, if not
exceed, this speed.

The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie, section
fiirector of the climate and cror> service of
the weather bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature has been nearly normal
throughout the State during the week. With
the exception of light showers on the north
west coa^t no rain has fallen since last Mon
day, but heavy dews and fogs have prevailed
in some sections.
The damage to grain and hay by the rain
of last week was much less than anticipated,
Beans were considerably damaged in some sec- j
tions, eÂ£r>ecially on the low lands, but as '
wtrm. ckar weather followed the rain the crop i
was not injured to the extent estimated at the .
time. Alialfa lands, pasturage and early sown
grain were materially benefited by the rain,
and in many places the soil was moistened
sufficiently to permit of cultivation. New grass :
is â¢â¢ing rapidly and early sown grain has
made a good start. Bean harvesting and"
thrashing will be completed in about two
weeks-. A large acreage of wheat and barley
will probably be sown in the great valleys.
Raisins were not materially injured by the
rain, and the crop is nearly all cured and un
der cover. The last crop of wine jsrapes is
being rapidly gathered 2nd sent to the winer
ies. Orange picking and shipping axe pro
gressing rapidly in the central and northern
sections and the fruit is reported of excellent !
quality.
COAST AND BAT SECTIONS.â The temper
ature has been nearly normal and no rain has
fallen since the first of the week, excest on ,
the northwest coast. Beans on high ground ;
were not materially damaged by the rain of
last week, but the crop on the low lands was
seriously injured. Hay was slightly damaged,
but grain was mostly under cover. New grass
has made rapid growth, and in some places
is highe enough for grazing. Hay baling con
tinues in some sections. Sugar beets are yield- \
Ing a Bood crop in San Benito County. There ;
Is a short crop of potatoes in Sonoma County. '
Heavy dews have been very beneficial to veg- j
etation. Plowing and seeding are progressing.
A correspondent at Campbell estimates that Â¦
the prune crop for this season is not more than i
one-fourth that of last year.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. normal
temiÂ»eriture has prevailed during the week and
conditions have been very favorable for early ;
t,own grain, pasturage and Citrus fruits. Grain
is making rapid growth and green feed is plen- ]
tiful. The rain of last week caused no dam- ]
age. Plowing and seeding are in progress. j
Orchardists are pruning-. Grapes and deciduous
fruits are all gathered. Oranges have ripened
rapidly, and heavy shipments have been made;
there will be a large crop, superior in quality.
Olive picking is progressing
SAN JOAQCIX VALLEY.â The weather has
been generally warm and clear, with cool
nights end heavy dews. Raisins are nearly all Â¦
cured Mi under cover: there was very little >
damage done by the rain of last week. All
other fruits, except a few wine Â«rraoeÂ«,- are !
gathered, and the last crop of grapes will soon
be disposed of. Oranges are ripening rapidly
and shipments have commenced; there will be â¢
a good yield, excellent in quality. Early sown :
grain, alfalfa and pasturage were greatly ben- Â¦
efited b^- the rain. In some sections the farm
ers have burned off the stubble and in others
have plowed it under. Plowing and seeding !
are progressing favorably. Cattle are in good .
condition.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â GeneraIIy fair :
weather has pre\ ailed during the week, with '.
foggy nights and mornings along the coast.
The rain of last week did not injure the bean
crop as much as then estimated, as it was !
followed by warm, clear weather. Bean thrash. i
Ing is progressing rapidly and will be com
pleted in about two weeks if the weather con
tinues favoratle. No othPr crops were in
jured by the rain and orchards and pasturage '
were greatly benefited. Plowing has com- |
menced in some places. Oranges are ripening j
rapl-ilv. The yield of hardshell walnuts will
be .lit. Â¦ - â¢- - ' ..Â¦ '
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Rain was fol- >
lowed by fair, warm days pnd cool nights; '
the effect if shown I" &M 'coloring of oranges. ;
The rx'i p=t ground in fi ne condition. Plow- |
Ing and seeding have begun. The rain was i
equal to irrigation in most orchards.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. s.â Everything in the wheat
situation to-day pointed to better prices and
more active trade for some time to come.
Slightly improved cables from .Liverpool, Paris
and Antwerp, based supposedly upon the re
c-eSit rise here, were the initial influences for
the advance. There was continued independ
ent strength in the corn situation, and this
gave an added impetus to wheat. December
o|Mr ed only a shad<Â» higher, but rose steadily
throughout the sesFion. January shorts who
have tried to bear the market were forced to
buy in at a loss and turned bulls when news
arrived of shortages in the Russian md Ar
gentine crops and of the removal of the im
port duty on wheat into Mexico at thirty cents
a bushel. Sales to Mexico vvere reported and
Just before the close of the session came re
ports of a decline in British consols, probably
the result of the war scare.
December and May were both bulled by pro
fessionals and gold at a difference of just 3
cents. December closed strong l<gl% cents ad
vanced.
Corn was active during most of the session,
with a strong undertone. Commission houses
were buyers and the selling was mainly by
longs taking profits.
December advanced to 59%<g59%c at one time
and closed firm %c higher.
Oats were active and strong. December closed
half up at 37% c.
Provisions ruled heavy early in the day.
Later there was a demand by shorts based
partly on the grain situation. January pork
closed 2%Â©5 cup at $14 82%. January lard 5@

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There was nothing new In the Butter market
yesterday, stocks being large and the demand
very light, owing largely to the municipal elec
tion. The houses kept open as usual, but hard
ly did business enough to pay them for it.
Cheese remans unchanged. There is plenty
here.
Some dealers are quoting a firm market for
strictly fine ranch Eggs, while others say that
they see no improvement. It is largely a ques
tion of supplies. All dealers, however, quote
a dragging market for everything but the very
best soods.

GLIB WITNESS
FOR THE JUDGE
Cochran Says Nome Mil
itary Men Had a
Price.
Gives Some Ancient His
tory About Mining
Claims.
Amicus Curiae Pillsbury had a few de
lighful moments at the close of the after
noon session of the Nome contempt in
quiry yesterday. That glib witness, M. J.
Cochran, one of Judge Noyes' pet ap
pointees, was on the stand. He said the
military could be induced to violate the
law of the district for a price before
Judge Noyes came into the country, es
pecially when approached by any of the
corporations. He even specified which cor
porations, meaning the Lane crowd. Thi3
it was that angered Mr. Pillsbury and
forced him to drive the witness.
"What do you mean by a price?" asked
Pillsbury.
"I mean that the military could be in
duced to violate the law of the district
and pose as preservers of the peace when
ever a certain class used its influence,"
responded the witness. Then he specified
time, place 1 and circumstance. When
Major yon Orsdale arrived, according to
Cochran, all was good and pure. Lieu
tenant Craigey was the bad man, he said.
The day's work closed with Pillsbury
still on the hunt for the price. He'll try
to get it this morning, when the cross ex
amination continues. The witness had
other things to tell of during his stay and
Metson came In for a fair snare.
Cochran Enters.
"Billy" Metson, terror of gun
I fighters, figured in another role in the far
away arctic country- He was the leader
of a gang of Swedes as well and with
this bticking and the moral support of a
] small and select coterie, proved quite a
power when the time came for action.
Such is the testimony of Cochran. Un-
I der McLaughlin's guidance Cochran went
j way back to times long ago. He gave a
' dissertation on mining and social condi
tions at Nome. He spoke of William H.
Metson and one Herrin, not the great Wil
liam F., but plain "Billy" Herrin. who
was of the Lane crowd that organized
the Swedish army of claim owners in the
j vicinity of Nome. Cochran certainly en
j joyed his position. He talked for hours
I and when the time arrived for adjourn
ment he looked longingly at Commissioner
Heacock and his eyes begged for more.
Cochran was put on by the respondents
to weaken the testimony of W. T. Hume,
After his direct examination Lafe Pence
j was put upon the stand, but little time
was consumed over him. When the ami
| cus curiae reached Cochran he went at
! him with earnestness and persistence.
Metson occupied his old post, that of
1 passer of yellow slips, these slips bearing
j questions. His fingers became cramped
i during the last minutes of the afternoon
j session and his advice was then bestowed
upon the amicus curiae by word oi
mouth.
So absorbed was Judge McLaughlin in
i the examination, of Cochran that he forgot
1 to go before the Circuit Court of Appeals
j to ask for an examination of Judge Noyes
I before the court. This will be done, how-
I ever, this morning. an>i in all probability
I Noyes will testify in his own behalf thia
i afternoon.
Vawter Against Noyes.
Major Thomas Turnbull was the first
I witness to take the chair. He overheard
! a conversation between Marshal Vawter
I and several others in the Palace in which
I the Marshal threatened revenge.
"Do you remember hearing Vawter say
in presence of a number of people in the
Palace Hotel that he would get even with
1 Judge Noyes?" interrogated McLaughlin.
"He said he would get even with him
yet," was the answer.
"What was the manner of Mr. Vaw
ter?"
"He was Quite earnest."
That was all there was of the direct
examination. On the cross-examination it
developed that the witness overheard the
conversation casually, and one day as he
listened to Marshal Vawter giving testi
mony in this case he recognized the
speaker in the Palace. He then wrote a
note to Judge McLaughlin acquainting
him with the facts.
Quick work it was and then M. J. Cock
ran was placed on the stand.
He was appointed by Judge Noyes as
commissioner of the Kaugarok. The first
questions led up to the Park versus Over
man case, in which W. T. Hume and
Cochran were both connected.
This was the case in which Hume testi
fied that his efforts were unproductive j
until Cochran came into the litigation,
and as a friend of Judge Noyes moved
things swimmingly. Cochran's testimony i
was to the fact that Fark, the plaintiff, j
insisted that he should go into the case '
on account of. Hume's conflict with the '
court, and that it had already cost hfm j
$75,000. Hume seemed glad to have Coch
ran in the ca.de.
To Repudiate Hume.
"Did you hear Hume make hostile
threats against Judge Noyes?" asked Mc-
Laughlin.
/ "Yes, every time we met and Judge
Noyes' name came up he said he would do
all he could to injure him. I remember
that when Senator Mitchell of Oregon was
elected Hume said that now he would
have Noyes removed."
Then the witness delved deep into -the
deplorable Nome conditions, social and
otherwise. As far as he was concerned
he was of the opinion that things were
greatly exaggerated and that "really it
was very much like a peaceful New Eng
land village." He was satisfied with
everything but the "sour dough" ele
mentâthe miners who could not be
miners.
Lafe Pence, the quondam Colorado Con
gressman and attorney for Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven, took the stand at the call of the
amicus curiae. Pence said adieu to the law
when the Nome fever reached- the city
and since then has been several kinds of
a miner. He testified as to the facts sur
rounding the receivership, the arrest of
McKenzie and the day of violence.
The rest of the day was occupied in the
cross-examination of Witness Cochran.
Many pointed questions were put by the
amicus curiae, but the witness denied j
them all with a rapidity and suavity that !
took the breath from all but the cross- i
questioner. Cochr#n's afternoon tale was
an attempt to picture a lang-grabbing
scheme on the part of Charles D. Lane.
Pillsbury tried to draw from the witness
an admission of knowledge on his part
that Lane bought up all the properties
which he possessed.

MANILA, Nov. 5.â A plot to massacre
the American garrison at Moncada, prov
ince of Parlac, island of Luzon, has been

spirators. Several town officials are im
plicated.
The woman who revealed the plot hid
a detective beneath a house in which the
leaders of the conspiracy were meeting.
Arrests followed and many incriminating
papers were seized. The plan was to set
fire to a house close to the barracks after
dark and when the soldiers came out to
assist in extinguishing the flames 150 con
spirators, armed with bolos, were to rush
on the guard, capture their arms and pro
ceed to massacre the garrison.
Commissioner Wright to-day took the
oath of office as Vice Governor. He will
be Acting Governor during the conval

will be unable to resume his duties tor
some weeks to come. The newspapers

HURLS HIMSELF
BEFORE A TRAIN
San Franciscan's Spec
tacular Attempt at
Suicide.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. Nov. s.â Ferdinand Win
ters of San Francisco attempted suicide
here by throwing himself in front of the
Sebastopol train this morning as it was
pulling out. Fortunately Winters was too
close to the engine when he made the
leap, and, instead of falling under the
wheels, he struck the fender of the en
gine. This lifted him off the track and
he received only a cut on the head, ex
tending from the middle of the forehead
around the right side of the face to his
chin. Eighteen stitches were required to
close the wound.
The attempt at suicide was made at the
crossing on Sebastopol avenue, Just at the
outskirts of the cliy. Engineer Byrnes,
in charge of the engine, saw him rush for
ward from the side of the track and throw
himself in front of the train. He quickly
stopped his engine and backed up to the
prostrate man, who was then brought to
town and afterward taken to the County
Hospital.
Winters recovered consciousness soon
after the dressing of his wound, and said
he had come up from San Francleco this
morning. He had resided in that city but
a short time. He formerly lived in Los
Angeles. Winters is 31 years old, well
dressed and carries an elegant gold
watch. His appearance is that of a man
of means. He says he has no recollection
of his attempted suicide, and does not
know why he did such a rash act. The
only theory is that he was temporarily
out of his mind when he tried to end his
life.

told him to mind his own business, and
they continued to wrangle about it till the
car reached Tenth and Mission streets,

fused to give him a transfer, and he said
he would stay on the car. The conductor
and motorman then announced their in
tention of throwing him off. and ne defied
them. The motorman pulled off his han
dle bar to prepare for action and Harrold

STUDENTS TO ACT
AS INNKEEPERS
Mrs. Stanford Advances
Plan to Solve a
Problem.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 5.â
The problem of providing desirable eat
ing facilities for the large number of stu
dents residing on the campus, particular
ly those rooming in Encina Hall, the
men's dormitory, seems in a fair way to
be settled since ib.rs. Stanford has in
terested herself in the affair. Negotia
tions are being made with the students
in Encina Hall with the view of having
the University Inn opened under their
management on a co-operative plan simU
lar to that In vogue in Memorial Hall at
Harvard University. Concessions will be
made that have not been allowed to pri
vate managements in the past, principal
ly as regards the rent of the University
Inn building, Wnich will be lowered con
siderably. It is understood that the uni
versity autnorities desire that the co-ope
rative management attempt the task of
supplying board at the rate of $16 a
month. The students would, of course,
be obliged to employ a professional ca
terer to have charge of the inn.
It is commonly rumored in coWege
circles that with iue opening of college
next September stuuents desiring to take
gymnasium work will find the facilities
greatly improved. The present wooden
gymnasium is to be replaced by a hand
some stone structure, rr.uch larger and
with all the modern Improvements. These
will include a large swimming tank,
which will be constructed at the edge of
the arboretum, northeast from the library
and directly opposite the museum. Noth
ing definite has been given out in regard
to the plans for the building, but students
generally are rejoicing over the prospect
of a new and well equipped gymnasium.
QUEENAN AND KANE
AGAIN TO CONTEST
Beturn. Match Is Scheduled Between
These Clever Boxers at the
Reliance Club.
OAKLAND. Nov. s.â Followers of fistic
sport have evinced much interest in the
return match between Perry Queenan and
Jack Kane, which will be contested
Thursday evening at the Reliance Club.
When the pair met there in September
their fifteen-round go was pronounced to
have been the best glove contest ever wit
nessed before the club. The men fought
hard and were clean and clever through
out. During the early part of the go
Queenan was almost gone, but he recov
ered and got the decision because his op
ponent was suffering from lack of condi
tion. Kane is now prepared to make a
rattling fight, and Queenan has a reputa
tion to maintain.
There will also be in addition to th : s
fifteen-round go a ten-round match be
tween Louis Long and Frank McConnell.

FULLER'S CAREER
IN GARDEN CITY
Man Arrested in Seattle
Is Wanted in San

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. s.â William S. Fuller,
who was arrested in Seattle yesterday on
a charge of embezzlement, was until a
few months ago manager of the Standard
Oil Company's office in this city. It is
alleged that he was short $500 In his ac
counts, and a warrant charging this was
swam to a few days ago before Justice
Cobb.
Fuller cut quite a swath as a sport here
for some time before he disappeared. He
was on a spree at the time he left and
telephoned his resignation to the com
pany. Fuller deserted a wife and child.
Some time before he left. Fuller, it is al
leged, posed as a single man and courted
and became engaged to a young lady
bookkeeper in a grocery store here. As
she was on a visit to friends in San Fran
cisco at the time he departed a story be
came circulated that she had eloped with
him, but this afterward proved to be un
true.
Fuller was located in Stockton and Los
Angeles, but before he could be arrested
he left those places. A surety company
that was on his bond has hunted him
down.
Fuller, it Is claimed, took the money in
small sums, which he spent gambling and
drinking. He will be brought back here
for trial.

badly to the British wounded."
Lord Kitchener further reports that

OPERA SEASON
CLOSE AT HAND
First Note of Welcome
Sounded by \ Walter
Damrosch.
The welcome first note of the Grau
grajid opera season was struck yesterday
afternoon at the California. Theater in
the lecture on "Parsifal" given by Waiter
Da.mrosch. A large and fashionable audi
ence greeted the favorite Wagnerian con
ductor, who seems to possess all his old
charm and power. "Parsifal, " last of the
Wagnerian operas to leave the strong
hold at Bayreuth. the lecturer ranks as
the crowning glory of Wagner's life
work. Written in the fullness of the great'
ma-ster"* power, it possesses in the high
est degree every distinctive quality of the
genius of the composer. The theme of
"Parsifal," the redemption of the world
from sin through love and pity, was
brought out in a clear and forceful fash
ion by the lecturer. He told the story of
tbe sin Â«f Amfortas, knight of the Holy
Grail, fallen from his high place as its
chief minister through the temptation of
the senses. Then Parsifal, the divine fool,
through whose purity and pity Amfortas
and the world itself is redeemed, was
clearly and sympathetically pictured.
Then Kundry. half god, half devil, with
her wild witch theme, was picturesquely
described by Damrosch in word and
music; witty Klingsor of the slumberous
heavy theme, the ethereal flower maidens,
the wonderful chant of the chapel of the
Holy Grail and the marvelous music of
the forest. Illustrating now by word, now
effectively on the piano, and again croon
ing a theme in a pleasant voice, Mr. Dam
rosch left a cleaY and comprehensive im
pression of the opera on the mind of his
nea/ers, who now only regret that "Par
fil'a!" cannot be among the Grau reper
toire. The next lecture will be on "Die
Meistersinger." that will be given by the
Grau company, and will take place to
morrow afternooaj at 3:15 o'clock.
Ladies' Club.
This may very properly be the designa
tion of the composite observation car
which will be run on "Sunset Limited"
for New Orleans and New York tn-week
ly, commencing December 6. Contempla
tion of the varied scenery from easy
chairs on the roomy rotunda may be al
ternated with letter writing, scanning
books or periodicals from the library or
in receiving- pleasing attention from" the
trained maid constantly in attendance.
This highly attract.iveÂ«feature of "Sunset
Limited' is indicative also of the high
standard of excellence attained by th?
Southern Pacific Company in the equip
ment and service of this model train.

POINT RICHMOND. Nov. 5.-The offi
cials of the Santa Fe system have de
cided to build a temporary shop of wood

OWENS ROBBED
IN HIS HOME
Daring Burglar Takes All
His Victim's Ready-
Cash.
L. D. Owens of the firm of Owens &
Varrey was the victim of a daring rob
bery early yesterday morning at his
residence at 3232 Jackson street. The rob
ber secured all the available money that
Owen had in the house. $80, and several
pieces of Owens' wearing apparel.
It was shortly after 5 o'clock when
Owens was aroused from a sound sleep
by having the glistening barrel of a re
volver placed near his face. The man
who held the weapon wore a mask and
told Owens that unless he gave him all
his money and made no outcry he would
shoot him instantly.
Mrs. Owens, who has been sick for
several weeks, was sleeping in the next
room, ajid Owens, being afraid that a
phock to her might terminate seriously,
gave the robber all the money he had
and told him to leave the house as quiet
ly as he had come.
Mr. Owens' daughter, who was sleeping
in the next room, heard the whole con
versation, but kept her presence of mind
and made no outcry. It was fortunate
for the robber that Owens had not an
available weapon handy at the time. He
is credited with being one of the best
pistol-shots on the coast, and no doubt
if he had had a pistol handy he would
r.ot have given up his money so easily.
SIXTEEN- YEAR-OLD BOY
KILLED BY A BASEBALL
Joseph O'Donnell Accidentally Struck
on the Forehead and Knocked
Senseless in a Game.
A baseball flying with great velocity
struck 16-year-old Joseph O'Donnell on

identity has not been disclosed, batted
the fatal ball. O'Donnell was standing
with his face to the sun, and could not
see the ball coming. He was struck In tlv?
middle of the forehead and knocked
senseless. He was removed to his par
ents' residence, at 476V^ Eighth street, but
in spite of medical attendance, never re
covered consciousness.

geon for the Coroner, found that deatn
had been caused by hemorrhage of a rup
tured blood vessel in the brain.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVE.UMR 6, 1901.
LARGEST FOUR-MASTED SCHOONER
EVER SEEN HERE COMES INTO PORT
The Alpina Carries an Enormous Lumber Cargo, and Her
Managing Owner Says She Is the Finest Vessel of Her
Class Afloatâ Whalers Make Port With Only Fair Catch
THE NEW FOUBT-MASTED SCHOONER ALPINA, WHICH MADE PORT SUNDAY WITH THE LARGEST CARGO
OF PILES EVER BROUGHT TO THIS PORT. SHE IS FOR THE LUMBER TRADE AND WILL RUN ON
THE COAST, WITH AN OCCASIONAL VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA.
THE four-masted schooner Alpina,
now at anchor off Meiggs wharf,
is the largest vessel of her class
that has e\per come to San-Fran
cisco. She is 1000 tons gross bur
den, 206 feet long, 41 feet beam and 16 feet
5 inches deep. She was built by Hall Bros,
at Port Blakeley and brought 1,200,000 feet
of lumber. Captain George Brikholm
commands the new vessel and J. H. Bax
ter is the managing owner. The Alpina
is intended for the coast trade, but may
make a trip to Australia with a lumber
cargo.
Steam Whalers Arrive.
The Narwhal of the Pacific Steam Whal
ing Company's fleet, and the Bowhead,
owned and managed by Captain Cook, ar
rived from the Arctic yesterday. Both
vessels did fairly well, but the Narwhal
in spite of her showing on paper has not
more than made expenses. She left here
in March, 181*9, and wintered off the mouth
of the Mackenzie River. In the season of
1900 Captain Cumisky took his vessel out
and secured five whales. Everybody on
board was joyous, and when the vessel
went into winter quarters there were vis
ions of a twenty-whale catch all around
the forecastle. During the winter, how
ever, their spirits sank, and in the spring
of 1901 the men were not so jubilant. Cup
tain Cumisky stood to the westward,
and while there were plenty of whales in
sight it was impossible to lower a boat.
Storm followed storm, and while the cry
of "there she blows" could be heard at
least twice a day, still the waves were
rolling so high that nothing could be done.
In consequence but two whales were
taken, and Captain Cumisky considers
that his run to the westward from the
Mackenzie River was of no avail.
The Bowhead brought in 21,000 pounds of
whalebone and 300 barrels of oil. Captain
Cook says he had a most uneventful
voyage, and is only too glad to get home.
An open sea and heavy weather made it
impossible- to get any whales to the east
ward, so his spring catch was nil. Never
theless the Bowhead did fairly well.
He Wanted to Die.
B. Nasu, a Japanese, jumped from the
ferry steamer Piedmont yesterday morn
ing. He escaped the paddle wheel, and
after six minutes of battling with the
waves was picked up by the ship's boat
and resuscitated. After the vessel reach
ed San Francisco he was taken to the
Harbor Hospital, where Dr. Yon der Leith
attended to him. Nasu said he had drunk
a quart of gin and two pints of whisky
before jumping overboard. He was tired
of life and had not the courage to com
mit hara-kiri. He is now well on the road
to recovery.
Schooners in Collision.
The schooners S. Danielson and W. F.
Jewett were in collision yesterday. The
Danielson lost her topping lift and the
Jewett lost a little paint.

FRUIT ASSOCIATION IS
LOSES IN TEST SUIT
Supreme Court Holds Grower* Liable
for Only Two Per Cent on
Contracts.
Ihe California Cured Fruit Association
will not in the future be able to control
the raisin and prune product of the State.
This is the result of a decision rendered
by the Supreme Court yesterday.
There has been a bitter controversy be
tween the growers and the directors of
the association as to the liability of the
former in cases where fruit was sold to
firms not in the combination. It was de
termined to test the law and a- suit was
commenced.
N Alnsworth, a fruit grower, who had
a corftract to turn over all his crop to
the association, which was to its
sale and receive 2 per cent of the pro
ceeds sold ten tons of prunes to the
Phoenix Raisin Seeding and Packing Com
pany The Cured Fruit Association de
manded $700 damages, the value of the
The Superior Court decided in favor of
the growers. Appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court, which declared that Ains
worth was liable, according to contract,
for only 2 per cent of the sale price. As
this amounts to only $14. tue case is not
within the jurisdiction of the Superior
Court It is a death blow to the asso
ciation, which will now probably go out
of existence.
CHINESE CASE GOES
TO SUPREME COTJBT
Alleged Native Born Chinese Woman
Resists Her Attempted Deporta
tion to China.
Weoy Ho, a Chinese woman, arrested
recently for being- a subject of the Chines:-
Empire unlawfully in this country, was
released yesterday by the United States
Circuit Court :>f Appeals on filing a bor.d
in the sum of $2500, pending an appeal
to the United States Supreme Court.
The decision of the Supreme Court whl
be waited for with interest by Mongolians
affected by the exclusion act, as it will
fest the legality of the ruling of the Sec
retary of the Treasury to the effect that
the Collector of the Port shall be satisfied
by competent evidence that the Chinese
person before him is entitled to admis
sion and that the Court Commissioner
and the court shall likewise be satisfied
in cases coming before them, in which
the Chinese alien shall have been charged
with being illegally in the country.
In the case of Weoy Ho, the defendant
alleges that she was born in California
and does not, therefore come under the
nrovisions of the exclusion act. The
Court Commissioner decided that the evi
dence did not satisfy him as to the truth
of her assertion, and ordered her to be dÂ«j-
P< Thts is* the delicate question that the
highest tribunal in the land will be calleJ
upon to settle.
The dry weather seems to agree with
roaches. They are almost large enough
to run from.
