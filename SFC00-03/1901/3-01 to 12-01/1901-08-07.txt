Some twenty-five or thirty years ago a
robbery on like lines was planned In con
nection with the Sub-Treasury on Com
mercial street, in' this city, but It. was not
carried through. Crooks from the East
came: to San Francisco and rented a place
a door or two above the Sub-Treasury
building which they fitted up as a saloon
at j a cost of several thousand dollars.
"When Â¦well settled and fully acquainted
with the surroundings they started a tun
nel in the cellar of their building, toward
the vaults of the Treasury in which at the
time were nearly 5100,000,000 in gold. Run
ning short of ready cash, they did some
work on the side and thereby aroused sus
picion on' the part of the police, perceiving
which they levanted. On examination of
the place after their departure their work
so far as done was discovered and thfl'ul-'â^
timate design made evident.
Several robberies of banks In the East
by which large amounts were â secured
have been effected by tunneling, but thÂ©
plunder was in the shape of currency and
bends easily carried on the person or in a
hand satchel, but never before has such
a weight cf precious metal been secured
and carried off by cracksmen. The rich
ness of the haul would have made Captain .
Kidd or Sir Walter Raleigh turn green
with envy, even though they worker!,
openly and U3ed cannon -to enforce their
demands. .
"When the session of detectives ended
there was much talk about the robberies I
of other days. In the detective mind the
following noteworthy events in robbery
were lun over again:
At the meeting of detectives last even-
Ing a machinist testified from an expert
viewpoint- that the hole in the bottom of
the safe was cut out by a professional
on account of the mathematical accuracy
of the borings. The plate wa3 lifted off
after the least possible number of holes
â¢was bored.
Then the red pepper came up for dissua
sion. ' It was agreed that the pepper wa3
on hand for the purpose cf throwing It .
into . the eyes of any possible disturber
during the busy hours of the night when
the gold was removed. An inquisition of
the storekeepers in Vallejo Junction ami
Crockett revealed nothing in regard to
the purchase of an extraordinary quantity
of red pepper.
Two theories of escape were discussed.
The detectives have divided themselves
into the land sharps and the water sharps.
The upholders of a water escape baae
their judgment on the 'trail of pepper to
the water's edge, the tying of the boat
to the piles nearby and the relict of goM
bricks. The other partisans bristle with
the belief that the gold and the men
whose backs must ache from the packing
of It have turned Inland. Sunken treas
ure or escape up the river or out into the
deep waters have no. charm for them.
Their "ideas run to burialâ an earth con
cealmentâand a hiding. Thinking that
the gang who so boldly and successfully
accomplished the robbery must nave
herded together before the blow was
struck a rigid search will be made for a
camp.

agreement that the Pacific Coast Com

raisins had not been legal and that the
growers outside of the "big five" com

titled to the raisins.
Accordingly yesterday morning about 4
o'clock Lee Gray, Frank Gray. Thomas

and did not wake up until two cars wera
loaded. He immediately swore to com

continued and the train returned to

place regularly at the tournaments of the

teams usually consisting i of four men
from each of the associate . and allied
clubs comprising the association. . Â¦

the contest.. Mrs. R. Gilman Brown of the
San Francisco and San' Rafael Golf clubs
and Mrs. H. H. . Sherwood of the Oakland
Golf Club, are: already practicing on the
Burlingame links, and several ladies from
the south are expected to come up for the
event. Â¦
It is now certain that the open competi
tion for amateur and professional golfers
to take place August 24 at Del Monte will
be a very interesting event. T..P. Gower,
the secretary of the Pacific Coast Golf
Association, announces that the follow
ing amateurs, who rank among the best
In the State, will take part in the event:
E. R. Folger of the Oakland Golf Club,
winner of the first championship of the

Sir William .Vernon Harcourt and
FKOFOSED GRA3TT IN AID
OF TRANSVAAL DISCUSSED
Since the discovery of the robbery, how
ever, Incidents connected with the sailing
of the vessel have caused a suspicion to
arise that the schooner was not anchored
in the bay near the Sausalito shore be
cause of the strike, but because she was
to be used by .the thieves to carry off the
gold bricks. *-
The schooner attracted the attention of
John Hayes, night watchman of the pool
room3 at Sausalito, and of Paul Truett,
schooner was anchored off
Sausalito for several days and but little
attention was paid to her, as it was
thought that she was kept there until an
opportunity was af|orded the owners to
place a non-union crew, aboard.
ton iyuj '^ HE mysterious departure of a
'. k from her anchorage In
Ej the bay off Sausallto may fur-
K nish the first clew to the where-
R abouts of the men who' robbed
**â¢ the Selby bullion vault./ The
night watchman of the town, both of
whom watched her closely. Both of these
men witnessed the incidents which serve
to connect her with the great robbery.
Night Watchman Hayes in discussing
the departure of the vessel last night said:
"Both Truett and myself watched the
schooner for several nights, as we were
anxious to know what success the owners
would meet with in getting a crew for
their vessel. We knew of nothing else but
the lack of a. crew owing to the strike
that wculd" cause them to keep her an
chored where she "was. Since we heard of
the robbery of Selby's vaults, however, we
have thought of several incidents which
cause us to think that she was connected
.with the bullion steal.
"Monday night two men, claiming to be
the captain and mate of the schooner,
came to Sausalito on the 12:15 boat. They
had a small boat at the wharf and jumped
into it and pulled out to the vessel. We
thought they had been across the bay
searching for non-union men and of course
did not pay much attention to them. . .
"About 3:30 a. m. we saw a naphtha
launch coming down the bay from the
direction of Alcatraz Island, heading for
the schooner and- Immediately, came to
the conclusion that the scab crew was on
board. The launch tied>up to the schooner
and remained for some time. The next
sign of life we -Observed was the launch
pulling ahead of the schooner, evidently
towing her.
"Both craft went right out to sea and
we thought no more of the incident until
we heard of the great crime." -
Inquiry along the water front brought
to light the fact that there was but one
schooner anchored off the Sausallto shore
waiting to secure a non-union crew. This
was the schooner Occidental, and she left
the harbor yesterday morning. Arrange
ments had been made with the Red Stack
Company to tow her out this morning,
and a tug was cent over for that purpose.
The Occidental, however, was not at her
anchorage, having taken advantage of-'the
tides and sailed out of the harbor on her
voyage to Humboldt.

It developed to-night that twelve more
strikers who were among the sub-leaders
were deported this afternoon and to
night. Some of the strikers have held
a number of meetings during the day se
cretly and have conferred with a num
ber of lawyers with a view of taking
some action. No one would take the
case. They have also appointed new com
mittees to carry on the work, and in the
case cf each committee five different
ones were created, so that when one is
taken away another will take his place.
A proclamation was issued here this af

It says In part:
"To the anarchists and professional la

not permit you to destroy this prosperous
city. If you have regard for your safety
you will shake its dust from your feet.

Several Sub-leaders Deported.
Various rumors as to their disposition
have been circulated In this city to-day,
it being- most generally reported that they
were taken into the Gulf in an unknown
and mysterious vessel. All of the de
ported strike leaders were Spaniards and
Cubans.

purpose being to catch them all in a

had been provided and the streets
were lined with thousands cf peo
ple. Shortly before the posse of citizens
reached the place the news reached the
etrike leaders and they quickly dis
appeared. The crowd was not daunted
and commenced a man-to-man search
through the streets and snatched the men
from the crowds. They were placed in
carriages that had been provided, between
heavily armed guards, and driven, away.

"No man ever tried to dispose of 'crook
ed' gold who didn't have something about
him that aroused suspicion.
"People who wish to dispose of gold
here must first gro to the receivins clerk,
who takes their names, the weight of the
gold and data, as to where it was ob
tained. Then the metal is sent to the
melter. The melting process will deter
mine whether or not the gold Is plugged
Â¦with lead or anything elseâ preventing us,
in fact, from being given a 'gold brick,'

Crooked Gold Brings Suspicion.
"People who bring gold here to be
coined do not have to tell you where they
got it?" was asked of the superintendent.
"No, they don't have to, but if they re
fused to answer the auestions we ask
they would naturally arouse - suspicion.
We keep a book of records that shows
where all gold conies from- This is kept
for statistics among other purposes.
Further than this, we know about all the
sources of the gold supply and where the
principal mines are. Consequently if a
man brought in a large supply of gold,
especially if it was refined, we would be
curious at once, and if he couldn't tell a
straight story as to where he got it we
would be suspicious. If he refused to an
swer questions at all we would be doubly
suspicious.
any man brought 'crooked'
gold to s. mint something would cause eus
picion to be aroused before he went out.
In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
where men steal any great amount of gold
they are caught." j
This is what Superintendent Frank
Leach of the United States Branch Mint
in this city said yesterday when question
ed as to the chance the men who robbed
the Selby works had of disposing of any
of their plunder at Uncle Sam's coining
establishments.
WE can't force a man who
comes here to sell bullion to
go to the Government to teir
where it came from, but if
"Yes, the men who stole the Selby
bullion could remelt the bricks that are
stamped if they could find some place
where they could keep a fire going for
their apparatus without being discov
ered."
"Supposing the thieves took the gold
from . the Selby Works to some Mint in
another part of the country â to the one at
Denver or that at Philadelphia. Couldn't
they easily dispose of it?"
"No easier than they could here. They'd
arouse suspicion. No, the /act that the
gold was refined wouldn't necessarily
show that it was stolen from a smelter,
though the smelters pay the owners of
ore in coin and not in bullion, for some
mines melt the gold. These are better
known than any others, too. â¢
"Yes, but all sources of gold supply are
so well known that when chunks are
being handled illegitimately suspicion Is
aroused." ' * " ""
"Couldn't bricks be cut up Into small
chunks and sold to pawnbrokers and
others?"
"Well," said the Mint superintendent,
"we'd hang that money up on some pre
text or another until we found out
whether or not we had received 'crooked'
gold."
"But if the man who left the bullion
couldn't be forced to answer questions as
to where he got it and could walk away
with his money at the end of twenty-four
hours, there wouldn't be time in which to
secure evidence upon, which he could be
held, would there?"
Would "Hang- Up" the Money.
"We'd notify the Secret Service agents
as -soon as the suspected person had left
the Mint," was the reply. Â¦ â¢
of the bullion has deposited It at the Mint
he is paid its value in gold coin. Theo
retically the bullion brought us is coined
into money, which is handed out to the
owners. In reality Uncle Sam only buys
the bullion, which Is In some cases not
coined for a long time after its receipt."
"If a person can deposit gold and get
its equivalent in coin within . twenty-four
hours afterward, the Mint officials
wouldn't have much chance of working up
a case against any suspected person,
would they?" was asked.

cloudburst at the head of Mono Creek, in

curred in August it was greater than any
thing ever known in winter months.
For a week it had been damp in the
mountain, and on Sunday there was a
light sprinkling of rain*, Stoddard and
Hildreth were where they could see Mono
Canyon, a gorge fifteen miles long, but
very narrow. Suddenly an intense roar
like thunder was heard from the head of
the mountain. At the head of the can
yon a white line of foam came rushing
down to -the valley. It was a solid and
irresistible wall of water of eieht to
twelve feet high. The roar of the flood
was terrific. It rushed down between
rocky walls over a dry bed. In its wake,
grinding, tumbling, smashing, came thou
sands of bowlders. The rush of waters
lasted for twenty-four hours, delaying
the men from returning to their cabins,
because no one could cross the creek.

and In Niles It has a plant employing the same
number of men. In Niles, also, the Tin. Plate
Company operates a plant of 600 men. and In
Warren the Steel Hoop Company's mills are
idle and 500 men are out. .They are all or
ganized and have nearly all secured jobs In
independent mills and outside works. The only
move expected in the valley at an early date
is the strike of the blast furnace men.
MONESSEX, Pa.â The tin mill is running
and the strikers have so far failed in their
efforts to get the non-union men out.
BEI,L,AIRE. Ohio.â From present indications
at the Bellalre works of the National Steel
Company the men will not come out on the
call of President Shaffer. An organizer has
been here, but could not get enough men to
start a lodge, as there are not many men In
this mill that the Amalgamated Association
would allow to become members, but it Is
thought here that If all the other trades come
out this mill will close down.
WELLSVILLE, Ohio.â The same namber of
mills are working and the temper of the men
toward. the company and the officers has been
In no wise altered. The arrest of H. B. Hen
derson, president of the Wellaville local lodge
of potters, on the charge of riot has deeply in
censed all the pottera In the Ohio Valley.
To-morrow at noon a kitchen will be estab
lished in the mill yard and the non-union men
will be furnished their meals within the mill
yard Instead of having them passed through
the fence as heretofore. Manager Brookman
absolutely refused to admit a reporter to his
office and .will not even tell the number of
mills now working.

Discussing the feature of the strike that
would- bear directly upon the- prosperity
of the country President Shaffer said: -
Will Be : Felt by All' Classes.
This will, bring "about -.1500 men out In the
National Steer plant In that town.- You. seÂ»
we have to- be on the watch for just euch
moves ' by the trust' as this one. â¢ â¢ We Â¦Â¦ know

are. fully prepared to meet every move they
make. ."5d^Â£M38SwÂ£iHEIflBBHMHHÂ£I3Bi
At" noon to-day I called out all Â¦ the men em
ployed In the Newcastle mills of the National
Steel Company. They .will stop . work at ;â¢ 12
o'clock ito-nlght. My purpose In doing this
was that ' I learned , . that ; the < trust . has been
piling up â¢ union-made bars In the old housings
of the -dismantled Jennings sheet mill for the
purpose of supplying the non-union mills when
the plants shall be shut down. It was a clever
trick, but it did not work. The trust. will need
all' the bars they have stored now bad- enough
before they are through with this strike. After
sending this telegram ; to .^Newcastle si re
ceived a reply which read , as follows: "Mill
wllUclose. Men are all firm.",, .. '
'The attitude of the men of the United
State Steel Corporation so far not affect
ed , by the strike has been .carefully can
vassed since the futile effort to arrive ] at
terms of peace in New York last Satur
day. Most of the nine vice presidents of
the different.' districts have been among
their men, arid their reports have reached
headquarters. In a general way the tone
of these reports Indicates that .the
men will support the stand of their of
ficers. An aggressive move upon the Car
negie mills Is Â¦ Intended. - -' Â¦.'.
â¢President-Shaffer .said to-nleht: , "We
want no one;tojcome out with us unwill
ingly. "If our people are not in full sym
pathy with our fight we would rather they
remain at wort. , They will not be. asked
to decide hastily."' ."They will have until
Saturday night; of this week to think it
over. When they, finally do decide: they
will come out' prepared for the battle.
There will be no: faltering, no indecision,
no ignorance In action, but a- unity of pur
pose and a determination to stand for
their rights." â¢ ... . Â¦ .â¢â¢ Â¦
After issuing the official call for next
Saturday night President Shaffer said:
Men Will Stand by Officers.
In the most extensive plant of the
National Tube Company, at McKeesport.
the organization is new and the effect of
the strike ordor is uncertain. The works
employ more than 8000 men.'
It has been the purpose of President
Shaffer to give the operating officials of
the remaining constituent companies of
the steel corporation time to anticipate
the calling out' of their men. If it was
intended to give these managers any
formal notification this plan was waived
to-dav, although they will still have till
the closing of operations on Saturday to
prevent the striking of their men.
The; call to the men of the three com
panies in the mills of which the Amalga
mated Association is strongest Is expected
to â¢ be generally and promptly responded
to. The movement will, it is expected,
radically suspend operations of the Fed
eral Steel Company and cut off half of the
production .of the National Steel and
plational Tube companies and throw more
than 40.000 men idle.
The attitude of the federation remains
uncertain, and- the president of the Amal
gamated Association is unwilling to dis
cuss it, although support has been prof
fered by officials of the federation. This
has been without concerted action upon
the part of the federation executive board.
Many affiliated bodies of the federation
have annual or long term' contracts with
their employers, and beyond financial and
moral support it is hard to tell how the
federation may go.
Attitude of the Federation.
The - order of President Shaffer is ex
pected to. swell , the number, of idle men
to over 100,000 at the end of the week.
President Shaffer was asked if the order
was intended to go to the union men in
the Carnegie Steel Company. He said that
he answered no questions on that score.
The Amalgamated Association has lodges
in the upper and lower union mills of the
Carnegie Steel Company and a foothold
in the Homestead, Duquesne and Braddon,
mines of the great bulwark of non-union
ism. In conformity to statements that
have been made by President Shaffer be
fore, these men will be expected to join
the strike, as will all Amalgamated men
and sympathizers In all plants of the
United States ' Steel Corporation. The
other companies of the steel corporation
not mentioned by the Amalgamated presi
dent and whose operations the association
will seek to hamper are the American
Steel and Wire Company and the Ameri
can Bridge Company. In the wire com
pany the Amalgamated Association has
only lodges in the Cleveland Rolling Mill
plant and the Joliet Rod Mill plant of the
company. The former Is now idle. -
In the plants of the American Eridge
Company there is no organization of the
men. The outside men handling and
erecting the woik of the American Bridge
Company are organized as the Bridge
and Structural Iron Workers. They are
not affiliated with the American Feder
ation of Labor.
Swells Idle Men to lOO,0OO.
No notice has been or is being sent to the
managers of the mills. We think their notice
has come from the' other side and they have
been warned of this ever since the Inauguration
of the strike. That ought to be sufficient.
' The call goes to the vice-presidents of the
districts in which there are mills owned and
operated by the National Steel, National Tube
and Federal Steel companies, as Â¦ well as to
the officials of the lodges In the mills. â . Â¦
President Shaffer added this statement
The strike call Includes practically all
Amalgamated men In the United States
Steel Corporation's employ not now on
strike. It was issued from the Amalga
mated Association headquarters and
mailed to all amalgamated lodge officials,
who are expected to call their men into
the strike. '
â sands of- men marshaled \ under
yie banner of the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers is
fairly- on. The long talked of general
strike order was issued - by President
Shaffer this â¢evening, ; to take t effect after
the last turn of the , mills on August 10.
What the result will be no man can fore
tell, but Judging by the expressed deter
mination of both parties to the contro
versy the battle will be waged to the very
last ditch. Much money will be., lost,
thousands upon thousands of men will be
idle, great suffering is looked for and even
bloodshed and death are possible and
feared.

It Is too serious a matter for stage play. The
Amalgamated men fully realize the task that
Is before them, and have been prepared for It.
They are. I believe, ready to suffer long for
what they firmly believe to be their rights,

ascertained from him that he had given
utterance to no expression of opinion re
garding the merits of the Sampson-Schley
controversy.
The department announced that Admiral
Howison would accept the detail. Admiral
Dewey was notified of Admiral Howison's
selection, arid the department sent to the
latter a copy of the precept, together with
Admiral Schley's letter relative to the
fifth paragraph of the precept and the de
partment's responses thereto, with cor
respondence in part of the official record.
Youngest Retired Admiral.
Rear Admiral Howison is one of the
youngest retired officers of his grade, hav
ing retired October 10, 1S99, when he reach
od the age of 62. During the early part
of the war he served principally on block
ade duty, but later participated in the
Viattle of Mobile Bay as commander of the
V. S. S. Bienvllle. It is an interesting co
incidence that he was in command of the
cruiser Vandalia at Samoa, which later
went down in the hurricane In Apia har
bor while flying the flag of Rear Admiral
Kimberly, who had succeeded him as se
nior officer on the station, and whom, he
now succeeds on this court. He was in
command of the Boston yard during the
Spanish war, and later was commander of
the South Atlantic station. He made the
famous long-distance cruise around Africa
In the Chicago as the last act of his ac
tive career, arriving in New York the
day before Admiral Dewey arrived in the
Olympia. It will be remembered that al
though he outranked Admiral Sampson,
who was in command of the reviewing
fleet at that time, he refrained from as
suming command, but courteously allowed
Admiral Sampson to do the honors upon
that celebrated occasion.
"Witnesses Being Called Home.
A preliminary list of the witnesses who
will be called to appear before the court
has been prepared at the Navy Depart
ment. Some of these officers are on for
eign stations aiid will be obliged to leave

Admiral Schley has submitted a list of
witnesses, some of whom are on foreign
stations, and these also will be ordered
home.
Among the witnesses desired by Ad
miral Schley is Lieutenant Benjamin W.
Wells, Admiral Schley's flag secretary
throughout the Spanish war. There are
no Spanish officers on Admiral Schley's
list.

asked regarding the Sampson-Schley in

The next step that the Employers' Association
took was to intimidate the Draymen's Associa
tion, to disrupt the Brotherhood of Teamsters
using the argument that If the brotherhood was
disrupted the Packers, Porters and "Warehouse
men would also be disrupted and they then
would turn their attention to other unions as
they came along. "When' the situation grew
critical, that Is when the Draymen's Associa
tion, at the dictation of the Employers' Asso
ciation, decided . to take up Morton's fight
against the Brotherhood of Teamsters then
the merchants who make . up the Employers'
Association changed their tactics a little The-v
represented to their employes that they werft
being treated all right and that they should be
satisfied with the'r situations under existing
conditions.
Move Against the Unions.
The four men In question were reinstated at
their old wage rate and the Incident was closed
for the time being, but from that dateâ last
Marchâ dates the existence of the Employers'
Association, organized to fight, the Packers.
Porters and "Warehousemen in particular and
all trades unions in general. The Employers'
Association, after being organized, lost no time
In' throwing Itself Into the general labor up
heaval. It has interfered in the carriage -work
ers' strike, " the big hardware supply houses
down town refusing supplies to carriage manu
facturers who recognized the union, and it is
safe to say that but for their interference the
carriage workers would have had no trouble. '
The next move of the Employers' Association
was to prevent' their own employes from Join-
Ing the union. Several firms gave their em
ployes to understand that If they Joined the
cnlon they (the firms) could not employ them
any longer. "W. "W. Montague, on Market
street, and Sachs Bros., on Sansome street
gave their men the preference of the union or
their Job. The men remained with their work
and from thone two firms no men Joined the
union. The only reason that more firms did
not follow their example was that about the
time the employers organized the union had
succeeded In getting nearly all the eligible em
ployes of the different business houses to Join
the union.
Â¦ So In the natural/ course of events there
came a time when the men employed as pack
ers and porters and -warehousemen awoke to
their condition, for It will not be denied that
the worktngman has been asleep for a long
time, and hence their organization. As is al
ready known, the big merchants of the city
took a stand against the packers, porters and
warehousemen some months ago and the Em
ployers' Association was organized only after
one of Its foremost membersâ a member of
the firm of Dunham, Carrigan & Haydenâ
had a brush with the union, because the above
mentioned firm took it upon' itself to cut th~
wages of four union members employed there.
Workingmen Were A9leep.
JN. 0'NEIL.Iy, . president of the
Porters', Packers' and Ware
housemen's - Union, has Issued
i*~, the following statement:
The employers In .the mercantile district of
this city â and when I say employers I mean
the wholesale dry poods merchants, the -whole
sale Iron and hardware firms, the wholesale
grocers and produce men. the cereal mill own
ers and managers and the different warehous
ing firmsâ are. with but very few exceptions,
paying comparatively low wages to their em
ployes, notwithstanding the fact that the work,
to a great extent. Is of an exacting nature
and requires. In every instance, that the ap
plicant be fairly educated and possess a cer
tain amount of experience.
When tho big merchants of this city learned
that there was such an organization as tbe
Packers, Porters and Warehousemen In ex
istence, they lost no time in declaring tho
said organization to be a menace to their
business. It 13 not the few extra dollars that
they will bo asked to pay to their underpaid
help that they care about, but it is the fact
that their employes are fully aware that they
are not receiving a just wage, and the mer
chant does not like to admit that he Is paying
wages to hla help that barely provides for the
necessaries' of Hfe. and.it ls'a fact that cannot
be contradicted that many firms in this city
are paying very low wages. Low wages Is
the groove in which the mercantile employers
of this, and of every other city. too. have been
in for the past ten years, and, being In a
groove, and such a groove as it is. it is not to
be wondered at that their progress has not
kept pace with the times. It has ever been
the policy of all employers to force men to
work for them for little or nothing, and with,
as stated above, some few exceptions the em
ploying element of this city are no exception
to tho general, rule.

The statement of P. EL McCarthy, pres
ident of the Building Trades Council, that
less than 250 painters are now on strike
is declared by E. H. Black,, president of
the Master Painters' Association, to>* be
absurd. . The additional contention of Mr
McCarthy that. the striking painters had
virtually won their fight and that there
is now no controversy between the jour
neymen painters and the association Is
characterised by Mr. Black. as ridiculous.
President Black 'Stated last ' night that
nearly 1000 painters were out of work as
the. result of the union's demands. Some
thing- like 100 master painters are doin?
business In this city and of that number
99 per cent belong to the association.
A few union painters have remained at
work, the employers state, and some non
union men are working, but many shops
have no painters at all at work. - -

CHANGES AGAINST BBOPHY.
The leaders also complained of â¢ the
action of the police officers In driving the
strikers away from their headquarters on
East street. Captain Dunleavy, Sergeant
Cook and two officers attacked the crowd
congregated there yesterday and drove
them all off the street. The two officers
were stationed in front of the sailors'
headquarters after the men had been
driven away and were given, orders to
keep the men from assembling there
apaln.-
The two policemen were removed a few
hours ' later at the request of Secretary
Furuseth. who told Captain Dunleavy
that since the inception of the strike there
had been no trouble of any sort at the
headquarters and" that his action vras jll
advired. The secretary said yesterday
"The men have their headquarters on
East street and the police have no right
to prevent them hanging: around there.
They have never created any trouble
there, but on the contrary have beer most
quiet. If there is any violence It will be
caused by the police trying to deprive the
men of their rights."
The leaders stated that the matter had
been brought to their attention- by people
who had overheard the sergeant urging
laborers to go to work as non-union men;
Unless immediate action is taken and the
eergreant prevented from interfering in
the labor strug-g-Ie the strikers say â¢ they
will report the matter %o the Police Com
missioners.
The . labor . leaders of the City Front
Federation visited Captain Dunleavy yes
terday and complained of the actions of
Sergeant Brophy of the harbor police.
They "stated that Information had been
given them to the effect that the sergeant
had 'been acting as a sort, of employing
agent for the. boss stevedores -of the
water front and had used his best endeav
ors to bring idle men to the' front to take
the places of the strikers. * .

When Cole's friends learned, that' hls.life
was in danger - they called aXi? police

vis' arrest on the charge of assault ; t to |
When Henry Davis reached his home
and had the blood washed from his face
he resolved to make another attempt to
reach his employer's . stables," at the.cor
ner of Webster and McAllister streets,'
where his team >was awaiting him. He
succeeded In getting aboard -a Howard
street car without, being molested. â¢ but
when the car arrived between Fourth and
Fifth streets a crowd of strikers entered
and dragged Davis from the car. By that
time they had learned that- the. shot
which had been fired by Davis had found
lodgment In, the breast of one of their
comrades, ' and in consequence they
showed no mercy to the boy. He was
hurled- to the ground and kicked and
beaten until the blood streamed from his
face. When he. was finally rescued by the
police he was scarcely able to walk. He
waa removed at once to his home.
A Second Beating.
Cole, the Â¦ wounded man, ran Immedi
ately to tils home and until he had
reached his room scarcely knew that he
had been shot. As soon as possible a
physician was summoned. It was discov
ered that the bullet had entered the left
side and. had passed not far from â¢ the
heart, but owing to the weak condition
of the patient it was not deemed advis
able to probe for it. ' ' ' *
In speaking of the events which led up
to the shooting Cole said that he had of
fered no violence to Davis, but that he
and John Connelly, and a few other mem
bers of .the- Brotherhood of -Teamsters,
had gone to Davis' home in the hope of
Inducing him by peaceful means ; to leave
his position. The wounded man declared
that when the shooting occurred he was
standing near the sidewalk and -almost
thirty feet from the man who shot him.
The other members of the brotherhood
who took part in the affair also claim
that Davis was not subjected to any .vio
lent. treatment, but that he was simply
requested to become" one of the strikers,
upon "Which he drew his revolver and fired
into the crowd.'
After Davis' face had been badly .beat
en he finally freed himself from the strik
ers and ran Into the middle of the street,
closely pursued by his assailants: When
he reached the car track he drew a revol
ver and fired a shot In the direction of the
strikers. No one fell. After firing the
shot Davis ran across the street and into
his, house. ' The strikers disappeared. from
the* vicinity of the shootin;? and no one
for a Â¦ moment suspected that Cole had
been shot. . Â¦- Â¦
Fires Into, the Crowd.
There were about five strikers In the
party which attacked Davis. One of them
approached Davis and after a very short
conversation struck 'him a 'blow which
felled him to the sidewalk. The com
panions of the man who started the fight
then rushed to the attack. "While Davis
was lying prostrate on the ground they
proceeded to beat and kick him about the
face and body. .
ble Is being done to save his life, but it
is feared he cannot survive. . â¢' Â¦ Â¦
The shooting Â¦ occurred at the corner of
New Montgomery and Howard streets.
Davis, - who since . the. beginning of
the strike has been In the employ of C.
A. Worth, a drayman whose office is at
316 Market street,- had just left his home
and was standing 1 at "the corner of New
Montgomery stieet, awaiting the" ap
proach of a Howard street car. One of
the few witnesses to the encounter gave
the following version of the shooting
yesterday afternoon.'
Jack Dorney, proprietor of a saloon at
6S4 -Fourth street, was before the
board to show cause why his li
cerse should not be revoked. Sev
eral days ago Sergeant Duke, meeting a
crowd of striking teamsters in front of
Dcrney's saloon, ordered them to dis
perse. Duke claimed that the bartender
told the men not to obey him, and dared
him to interfere with them. 'Dorney ex
plained that he was not present at the
time, otherwise he would have called the
barkeeper to an account Upon this
showing and 'the statement of Attorney
Archie Campbell, who defended Dorney,
that the latter was friendly to the Police
Department, the charge was ignored.
Police Officer Timothy Cronln was fined
$50 for reporting off duty in an In
toxicated condition. Cronin was de
tailed to protect a non-union team
ster, and after seeing him . . safely
home he took several ' drinks ot white
wine which "went to his head," as he
expressed it. As this was his first of
fÂ« rsÂ« the Commissioners decided to let
him. off with a fine.
The Police* Commissioners met last
night and granted 137 permits . to carry
ccncealed weapons. Amongr the persons
â¢who were given the privilege of carrying
"guns" were Robert Morrow of the Sut
ter-street Railroad Company; Ward Mc-
Allister, who Is a member of the Pacific
Vrlon Club, and Abe Goldstein, the
"fighting barber" who fired Into a crowd
of . strikers who attempted to wreck his
place of business on Fourth street a few
nU'htt ago. John Curtin, who conducts a
private detective agency, was given per
mission to arm forty-four of his men,
who are employed in protecting non
union men In the wholesale district. Thir
teen permits were granted to members of
the Merchants' Association on the rep
resentation that it was necessary for
them to protect themselves in case they
were attacked.

Friction trtth the police Is becoming
more and more galling: to the strikers on

The officers jumped from the wagon
with clubs In their hands 'and dashed, into
the mob,: .which j numbered by this time
fully 200 men. They struck right and left
with their clubs and soon had the crowd
breaking for cover.; The strikers ran Into
the -neighboring saloons, but the police
followed them in and. drove them out. and
continued driving .them' until there : was
not a'man to be seen on the streets. ' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
1 Michael "Doyle, one of the mob who
persisted ; in ; remaining , in the i neighbor
hood.'lwas arrested and charged with dis
turbing the peace.
The conflict was caused by an attack
made by several of the strikers on a deaf
mute, whom they mistook for a deaf mute
who had been at work on the Mall dock.
Tl*e mute: was walking Â¦ , up -Brannan
street last night about 7 o'clock when he
was stopped by , several union . men. He
could not answer -.their queries and they
proceeded to beat - him. The street was
crowded at the time with strikers and it
was feared that they would attempt to
make a raid on the non-union men em
ployed on the Mail dock. Captains Ander
son and Wilson witnessed the attack on
the unfortunate mute and tried- to rescue
the man. The crowd was too dense, how
ever,, and they could not reach him.
In the vicinity of the Mail dock are sev

Ing for a committee of three to meet a like

N. Kuss and H. F. Wagner. The request was
again complied with, the committee met, and.,
as Mr. Black says, the results were not satis
factory. -This may be quite true, and. Judging
from past experience it could not be otherwise,
and the blame for the same must certainly not
be charged up to the Building Trades Council
and certainly not to the present movement,
since It was sent out five days prior to the
request of the Building Trades Council In be
half of Painters' Union No. 73. Â¦' Which Â¦ re
quest was acknowledged by Charles A. Lytla
Esq. on May 20. 1901. In which tie sa!d that
it was referred to the Master i Painters' Asso-
"At a meeting of the Master Painters' Asso
ciation of the Pacific- Coast, held March 2, 1900.
a resolution was passed to have your union
appoint a committee of three to meet, a like
number of our association on Wednesday even
ing, March 7, at 7 o'clock, at the store of P.
N. KVS3 & Co.; 20S Post street. Respectfully
yours, HENRY V. WAGNER, Secretary."
This communication was by motion of Paint
ers' Union No. 73 ordered received and filed
and the request complied with. The members
of that committee on the evening of March 7
called st the p.bove mentioned location and
waited for a reasonable time, with the result
that nt-ne of the committee from, the Master
Painters' Association put in an appearance,
go much for letter No. 1.
The rvbove statement, if true, would place
Painters' Union j No. 73 in anything but a
pleasant position. It is unfortunate for Mr
1 Slack, however, that the facts in the case do
not bear him out. The first letter written by
th.? Master Painters' Association is dated
March 5, 1900, which reads as follows:
"One of the reasons why we shall not grant
this demand is the increase in the cost of ma
terial. Oils and leads are higher now than
they have been for some time arfd to pay out
man more than â¢ they are receiving now would
mean ruin to our business."
"We have decided that the condition of our
business doe3 not warrant the payment of
higher wajres to brush hands. We pay the
men what they are worth, and every member
of the association has men in his employ to
whom he pays more than $3 50 per day. Evi
dently the order issued by the union does not
affect these men, for they are still at work.
Mr. -Black* says that "we were informed
three months ago that an increase of the pay
of oalnterp would be demanded by the union
August 5. We appointed a committee to meet
with a committee from the painters, but the
meeting resulted unsatisfactorily. The mem
bers of the association, have met often since
then and thoroughly canvassed the situation.
As a result of our deliberations we have de
termined to refuse to grant the demand. Our
members are unde.r $500 bonds to live up to
the laws of the association, and so far only
one member has shown a disposition to grant
the increase.
Many statements emanating from employing
painters appeared in the press of to-day,
especially that of Mr. Black, which may be
taken as representative of the whole.
P. H. McCarthy, president of the Build
ing Trades' Council, sent the following
statement to the press late last night,
regarding the painters' strike:

BOX MAKERS DECLARE STRIKE
Secretary Rosenberg of the Labor Coun
cil addressed the committee at some
length. Reports were received to the ef
fect that the entire membership of the
union would walk out to-day without fail.
The entire strength of the organization,
numbering about 530 teamsters, will walk
put this morning. It is expected that this
will seriously cripple the building crafts,
as no mason work can be done on build
ings now in course of construction or to
be erected without the co-operation of the
sand teamsters. It was estimated by a
builder last night that the walkout of
the -teamsters would within a short time
throw 2000 carpenters and allied building
craftsmen out of work.-
The executive committee of the Sand
Temsters' Union met at the union's hall

From the foregoing it will readily be under
stood that these firms have selected the easiest
plan to secure non-union or scab help. It will
also be understood why all the packers, porters
end warehousemen did not respond to the call
of their organization and those who did not
respond to that call have violated a solemn
obligation; they have soiled their honor and
have 6hown themselves to be utterly without
principle, and that the dictates of their vicious
Plan to Get Non-Union Help.
When the general walkout was ordered, and
*ven before that date, certain firms tried (and
the firms mentioned below succeeded) to have
their employes sign a typewritten resignation,
thereby hoping, it is presumed, to change the
existing circumstances. The firms that suc
ceeded in this plan are the following: William
duff & Co., 20 Front street: Baker & Hamil
ton. Pine and Market; South San Francisco
Packing Company, Schloss Crockery Company.
Zellerbach & Co.. Gulf Bag Company. Oriental
"Warehouse. Eagle Warehouse. M. Ehrman &
Co.. Dairymen's Union, R. K. Xason Jones,
Paddock & Co. '
It is against such a class of men that the
tinions are making their manly fight, and these
menâ I mean employersâ have shown them
selves to be devoid of every principle that Is
manly and of all that it good and just.

In conclusion let it be noted that the mem
bers of the Employers' Association are for the
most part the very employers of the packers,
porters and warehousemen, but that fact docs
not deter its members from making a pro
longed and strong fight and the few who did
remain at work and those who did not have
the manhood to continue the fight the organ
ization is well rid of and the members of the
union are thoroughly glad that the present
crisis has come about, if for no other reason
than to know who are the men.
Believing that the public should know the
exact position of the Packers'. Porters' and

Further complications are expected in
the event the lumber Is discharged, as the
union lumber teamsters not yet on strike
will refuse to. handle any cargoes dis
charged by non-union hands.
The status of the teamsters' strike on
this side of the bay remains unchanged. .
The Humboldt Lumber Company has
cargoes on the Fteamer North Fork and
schooner Bella, which will be unloaded to
morrow if non-union men can be secured.
The steamer Mandalay, carrying 180.000
feet of lumber consigned- to the Humboldt
Lumber Company and E. B. & A. L.
Stone Company, was discharged to-day.
The Howard Company's engineers have
not been ordered out yet, because the
company has not attempted to discharge
any vessel the crew of which is on strike.
Two engineers and a fireman were called
off the coal bur.kers of the Pacific Coast
Company by Stationary Engineers' Union,

elation. . This request called for a reply deal-
Ing with the contents <Jf the same, which re
ply never came, so the public can readily see
that if the master painters were desirous' of
conferring with the council they had plenty of
time to do so, and it will not now do for Mr.
Black to say that they conferred with No. 73
with bad results. The fact is that the em
ploying painters are themselves to blame and
I hope they will cheerfully take upon them
selves the responsibility of this controversy
now troing on and not try. to place it on the
shoulders of Xo. 73, which is not entitled nor
called upon to bear so heavy a burden.
It is not fair to the material men to say
that they have raised material so high that
with an Increase of a few cents a day in
wages paid the men it prohibits painting. This
I know to be incorrect. AYhen material and
wages are low very little improvements are
going on ; when lumber can be purchased ' for
$9 per thousand and oil and lead are low few
people can be found who care to build, but
when they are high, as Mr. Black says of the
present, building and every other industry is
brisk. Some of Mr. Black's own patrons stated
no later than to-day that his views were not
shared in by them; that if he insisted on his
low wage scale some other, employing painter
would have to do their work. With reference
to his $500 bond I desire to say that it is a
very convenient bond and binds no one only
inasmuch as they desire to be bound by }t.
It was put up when the master painters came
together for the purpose of arranging a sched
ule of prices, below which no man doing a
legitimate trade could figure, and not for the
purpose of fighting the men that do the work
or opposing -a living wage. Thus it will ,be
seen the bond, as I have stated, is a very
convenient one. The Building Trades Council
is in this Instance very sincere and honestly
working to elevate not alone the Journeyman,
but also the employers, and is Â¦willing to co
operate with them at any time for the best
interest of this city and State.
During the past week a number of men
have been rounded up here In Los An
geles and sent by one route or another to
the present scene of Clark's operations.
J. W. Miller of this city has acted in the
capacity, of "enlistment agent." Another
lot has been rounded up In Arizona, and
will congregate at the same center.' Every
man has been asked to go to work at
either driving stakes, packing chain or
handling powder, but at the same time he
has been given to understand that danger
would probably attach to his work, and
his willingness to make a flght If neces
sary has been determined in that way.
When interviewed to-day neither of
Clark's representatives would admit that
a fighting force had been sent to the
desert. ,J. Ross Clark said:
"We have been employing a large num
ber of new men lately, both in the engi
neering anfl other division, and I- think
our interests on the desert are now so
well protected that there Is little danger
of any further action, such as the taking
of the Meadow Valley grade. The men
we have sent in have been picked up here
in Los Angeles and through the country,
and they have been very well provided
with necessary 'camp equipment." "
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 6.â Senator W. A.
Clark and his Los Angeles and Salt Lake

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
The new tactics may not prove more successful than
the-old, but they certainly cannot be worse or more
ineffective. Kitchener's huge, army has had no more
chance to catch the nimble Boers than, an elephant
would have, to catch a flea. Ifjias entailed a heavy
expense and it has accomplished nothing beyond cap
turing towns and burning farmhouses. A smaller
army, but with greater mobility, will not cosKso much
and may be- more effective. The reopening^of the
mines will unquestionably be an -important feature in
the new situation. Even if the -Boers do "not come
in to share in the work and the wealth that will result
from mining activity, the community" as a whole will
be benefited. Anything that tends to revive the in
dustries of the Transvaal will be better than the policy
of destruction which has prevailed hitherto.
The new tactics are said to have been suggested by
Lord Milner. ' It is the belief of that statesman
that while little has been gained for the British by
burning the Boer homesteads, much might be gained
by reopening the mines and reviving industry/The
argument is that. if work'' be resumed and money be
once more plentiful in and around Johannesburg a
good many Boers who are now on the warpath would
be inclined to settle down and go to raising N supplies
for the miners. In other words, the Boers are to be
coaxed to come in and make money. Those who do
soare to have the security that the British garrison
can give. Those who do not are to be hunted over
the veldt and, the' hills: by the ,'50,000 horsemen
specially detailed for that purpose.
The withdrawal of so large a body of troops still
leaves Kitchener with an army in excess of 200,000
men. He has 50,000 : men organized and drilled as
mounted infantry, and -with these he intends to camp
on the trail of the Boer commandos and follow them
wherever they go 'or until the last one of them sur
renders or is dispersed and broken. With the re
mainder of his force he will guard the railroads lead
ing to Johannesburg,, and establish in that district a
sufficient army to protect the gold mines and those
who operate them. . .
SOMETHING like 70,000 troops who have been
serving with the. British colors in South Africa
are to be sent home. One story says the :,men
have been recalled by the British War Office because
they are needed in India. Another story says they
are to be sent home by Kitchener because they are
not needed in Africa. As to which of the reports is
true no outsider can decide at this moment. The
one undisputed fact js that the troops are to be sent
away from the seat of war and that new tactics on the
partÂ»of the British a,re*to be employed.
The experience of the army posts seems to be the
same everywhere, though the effect upon the men at
posts in the tropics is likely to be more serious, since
the use of whisk}' there has a very bad effect on the
health of the men. 1 . , >
"I am of the opinion that the temperance people,
with the best of intentions in the world, have made
matters worse. It was one fight where the saloons
and those who oppose them were together when Con
gress abolished the canteen. The whisky men wanted
it done away with so that they could have the'soldiers
to trade with, them and' drink their whisky. They
saw the inevitable resu^. The temperance people did
not see it as a choice between two evils, but, jumping
to the conclusion that they could abolish drinking by
doing away with the post canteen, aided the whisky
men right along." '
Captain Slaker, the commander of the post, says:
"Since the . abolition of the canteen, where the men
could have their beer, right at home, there has been
an increase in the number of arrests. The change has
not been effective to prevent the men from having 1
drink at all. If it did it would be all right, but it has
driven them to seek the saloons,Â»and there they get,
not beer, but whisky. The strong drink is what makes
the trouble.
the men are more likely to get drunk and make
trouble." ;
There is a great increase in drunkenness among the
enlisted men, and the change from the light beer of
the canteen to downtown whisky has had a very de
moralizing effect. The city police are in continual
trouble with the drunken soldiers from payday until
the pay is spent in the deadfalls. The correspondent
says that "the rules are such that after a man has com
pleted his duties, if he is not on guard, he may be
absent until retreat: is sounded, and then until 'lights
out' he is free once more. , This gives the chance
needed to try and drink all the whisky in town, and
the men who carouse will take it. In former times
they had the post canteen, where they would gather
and gossip and drink beer. The beer did not hurt
them much in such surroundings, and the results of
the operation of the system on discipline seemed the
best, when it was considered that the men would
have their liquor. Now when there is no restraint of
the camp around them, when they have whisky in
stead of beer for their beverage, the officers say that

quirer, writing from Honolulu, says that since

years of age are to vote without -challenge, as are
all who have borne arms in the service of the United
States, of the Confederate States or of the State of
Virginia. But no veterans who draw salaries or pen
sions of any sort can claim exemption, thus barring
from the benefits of the waiver all the white or colored
ex-soldiers who have taken or wish to take advantage
of the Federal pension laws. His scheme also pro
vides, like that of Alabama, for the establishment of
election boards having authority to admit to registra
tion as voters all "persons of recognized good moral
character."
The Tennessee movement has not yet advanced far
enough to disclose clearly what restrictions will find
favor among the Democrats of that State. In Tennes
see the negroes were never numerically strong enough
to control the politics of the State, and the effort to
exclude them from the polls can be due to nothing
more than a desire to imitate the action of other
Southern States.
In the meantime a number of negroes, of means in
Louisiana have organized. to raise an issue before the
courts which will test the constitutionality of the suf
frage law in that State. From that organization much
good may come. It is quite possible,' that all these
ingenious suffrage schemes which the Southern
leaders have so cunningly thought out and so boldly
pat into effect may burst like a -bubble at the first
?Â¦ouch of the constitution of the United States.
or understand it when read." All persons over 60
The plan proposed in the Alabama convention pro
vides that all men, white or black, must qualify them
selves for the elective franchise by paying their poll
taxes, proving their ability to read and write and
showing that they have been engaged in lawful occu
pations for twelve months. For the purpose of en
abling illiterate and thriftless whites to escape the re
strictions it is provided further that all old soldiers
or their descendants shall have the right to vote, pro
vided they pay their poll taxes. Boards of registra
tion are tc be appointed in each county to determine
the qualifications of voters and to register them. It
is expected, of course, that the boards will let the
whites in and shut the blacks out, but it is said the
requirement of a lawful occupation is aimed not at
the blacks but at gamblers whom the convention de
sires to deprive of the franchise.
In the Virginia convention Senator Daniel is said
to have devised a plan which differs slightly from that
of any other State. He proposes that a voter must
hereafter possess property valued at $300 at least,
must pay a poll tax of $2 at least six months before
election day and must be able to read the constitution
OF old it was known and said, "Evil communi
cations corrupt good manners," and the
rapidity with which the Mississippi plan of
suppressing negro suffrage is spreading over the
South affords a new proof on a large scale of the truth
of the proverb. Perhaps the Southern manners in
that respect were not very good to begin with, so
that process of corruption has been easy; but under
any circumstances the promptness with which State
after State is following a plan which when first pro
posed was considered unconstitutional and revolu
tionary, is something remarkable. Louisiana, South
Carolina and North Carolina have already suppressed
negro suffrage by law; Alabama and Virginia are at
present working to the same end through constitu
tional conventions, and it is now reported that a
movement has been started in Tennessee to suppress
the colored vote there.
It is to be noted that no two Southern*States have
adopted exactly the same plan in dealing with the
issue. That in itself is not surprising since no one of
them is good enough to incite imitation, but the vari
ation ma}' be due to an intent on the part of the
Southern leaders to try as many plans as possible so
that in case some of them are declared by the Su
preme Court to be unconstitutional, one or more of
them ma}' stand the test and serve as a guide for the

He was asked a number of questions, all
of which he said he was unable to an

he testified that tlfe railroad company only
expected to transport crushed rock for
road purposes for but a short distance
and therefore would have .to charge a
higher rate than for long hauls. In re

barges that will cost $50,000."
The most important witness Interrogated
yesterday was Captain Albert H. Payson,
second vice president of the San Francisco
and San Joaquln Valley Railway Com
pany, which is now a part of the Santa
Fe system. Attorney Short interrogated
him on the cost of the road to Bakers
field. * He said it cost 521,000 a mile. He
stated that $8,500,000 had been expended in
building the road and that there had been
a deficit in interest so far as the road is
concerned. He said he could not give the
amount of the deficit. The witness stated
that the company had not completed its
improvements and that thousands of dol
lars more would be expended. He 3aid
the road is still in process of construction.
"My estimate of the cost of the road," he
said, "does not Include the ferry system.

SOUTHERN SUFFRAGE SCHEMES
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Attorney Short In an interview after
adjournment stated that the case for the
oil men was practically in; that from the
testimony of the witnesses for the railroad
he felt that even a stronger cas* than
expected had been made out; that the
evidence had dicclosed the fact that tho
railroad company was earning on a basis
of J1.000.0CO a year from Kern County
alone, which would probably be doubled
within a year from this time: that their
earnings on the Kern River spur
amounted annually to the original cost
of construction. It. would be -made
perfectly apparent, he said, that the rail
road company was making 'a profit far
out of proportion to reasonable compensa
tion for services rendered, circumstances
considered.
Attorney Short attempted to Introduce
a pamphlet on oil, which contained clip
pings from newspaper articles on the
production along the Southern Pacific
road.- Mr. Hcrrin said he had no objec
tion to its introduction if Mr. Short
would not object to him Introducing cir
culars issued by oil promoters.
W. A. Bissell, assistant traffic manager
of the Santa Fe, was the next witness. He
denied that his line hauled oil from Coal
inga. He said the. Santa. Fe hauled oil
only from Bakersfield; that they com
menced to ship from that point as soon
as the oil fields "were opened; that at the
present time the line was shipping from
fifty to 150 cars a week from the oil fields,
and that the ousiness was constantly on
the increase/
Attorney Short asked Mr. Sproule, who
was recalled, about the McKlttrick line.
He desired to know whether the railroad
company had not received more revenue
from that line than from any similar line
In the oil fields. Mr. Sproule said the Mc-
Kittrick line was in operation long before
the oil developments were thought of. He
added that the Kern River business was
something new and he had doubts as to
Its permanancy. ,
Short Confident of Winning.
William H. Allen Jr., who said he was
connected with a title insurance com
pany in Los Angeles, was the next wit
ness examined. Mr. Allen was a willing
witness and his testimony was Interesting
to both sides. He said he was a member
of an oil association in Los Angeles
which waa organized to better the condi
tions of the oil market in that section.
He said it was because the oil business
was in a demoralized state that he ap
peared before the Commissioners in the
interests of the Los Angeles oil producers.
He 'said they were selling oil in Los An
geles at 74 cents, although some wells had
been selling for less; that they could not
produce* oil for less than 60 cents; that
the Bakersfield oil r could be produced at
20 cents per barrel, and that the price was
regulated in Los Angeles by the price of
Bakersfleld oil, with the freight, 51 cents
per barrel, added. Mr. Allen thought the
reduction would not do oil producers any
good.
schnltt whether he could furnish the en
tire list of 170 Items, and when the rail
road man replied that he could Mr. Short
allowed him to depart with the admoni
tion that he return this morning with the

We have only sought to open the way to the people to repudiate him and all his
works. That way is open now, its traverse is safe for every man. Will the party walk
therein next Tuesday?
Heretofore men have justified snubbing the primary by pleading that when they
appeared they were either not allowed to vote, or their votes were miscounted and tal
lied against the purpose they intended to express. All this was true, and it was a meas
ure of justification for the indifference which threw the city into the hands of bosses, to
be stripped like a sandbagged victim of highwaymen. ' But this is true no longer. The
primary law throws legal sanction around the fountain that is potential with government.
Every citizen is amply protected in the casting of his vote and in having it counted as
truly expressive of his purpose. The people now have it in tfieir power to forever break
up and end bossism and boss rule in San Francisco. If they are indifferent and permit it'
to win at the primaries, they will have no right to complain. If Republicans desire to
canonize Martin Kelly let them accept him as an expression of the best the party can do,
as an incarnation of its spirit, and its ideal leader, and not be ashamed to proclaim him
to the world as the excellent and full flower of San Francisco Republicanism.
We hear and attend the cry that there is no party politics in a city election. Grant
ing tfrat to be true, the city officers are elected by one party or the other. They issue
from ranks trained in one of the great schools of politics. Do Republicans intend to
admit that their politicalschool fails to train men for upright, clean, decent and honest
administration of a city? Do they intend to admit that such training and such men may
be found only in the ranks of the opposition? If they so intend how will they answer a
questioner who asks at what stage of public responsibility Republicans become qualified
for administration?
We think not, and so thinking have been willing to make a fight against a pros
pective rule that will gall the withers of the party if it come to pass. This is a Republi
can city. Every interest of its people combines to make it so.^ Its commerce, prosperity
and progress depend upon the public policies of the Republican party. In its govern
ment it should show the world the best that Republicanism can do in municipal govern
ment. It should, inspire the State with that spirit which must be depended upon in the
important elections next year. Can it do any of these, things by installing Martin 'Kelly
in power?
The Mayor now has the one-man power to remove and appoint If Martin Kelly's
ticket win at the primary and the polls, does any one doubt the realization * of this
plan of the former boss? Does any one doubt that the fire, police, schools and public
works â¢will be given Qver to Martin Kelly, farmed out by him to use as he pleases? Un
fortunately, he is at present figuring as a Republican boss. 'He desires to usurp the or
ganized power of the part]/, which is composed largely of the- intelligent, upright and public
spirited men of the city. Do they accept him as an outward- and visible sign and moral
embodiment of the virtue and genius of the Republican party? Do they expect to point
to him with pride as their party leader? ' ( .
Whenever this has been the case the business men, the citizens who /furnish the
capital* and enterprise that make the city, have gone about: the, streets Meploring condi
tions that exist solely by their permission. The municipal government originates in 'the
primary* That is the fountain head, and the stream that flows irom it will rise no higher
than its source. If the primaries are given over to Martin Kelly, and result in the elec
tion of a ticket, we will have a Martin Kelly government, and those who liave '..by- indif
ference permitted it will have no right to complain of the result. The ' outside world
will have a perfect right to say that San Francisco wants that kind of a. government,
and the finger of scorn will be pointed not at the government, but at the people of the
city. Let us be under no illusions in the matter. The charter concentrates great power
in the Mayor. That office is the prize sought by the political looters. It is the key that
unlocks the municipal treasure house to the spoilsman. The most skillful and astute boss
that ever ruled this city earnestly desired the affirmance of the right of Judge Wallace
to remove the old Board- of Supervisors. He said: "I wish that power to remove put
in. the hands of one man, one officer. Then. I will elect that officer/and if a Board of
Supervisors get stiff-necked I will oust them and appoint their successors, who will not
be so stiff." ' .
San Francisco has been boss ridden, and swarms of parasites have stung and bled
hefi She has suffered, morally and materially, from the control of men whose only in
terest in her was what profit they could get through a political control that' was sought
for personal and not public ends. - ~

THE contest at the primaries next Tuesday is for the uplifting of 'the politics of
this cltyy and putting- its public affairs in clean hands. The present administra
tion of the city 'has been repudiated by its own party and the party organ. .While
that may. not be significant, it is true that the administration has proved far from
satisfactory to the people, and those who have the most at stake in the good name and
prosperity of the city hope to see its affairs committed to more skillful and unselfish men.

The British bark Melanope arrived from

good run of 66 days. On the 1st inst. she
was caught in a heavy gale, during which
the wind blew from all points of the com
pass. Then the vessel ran Into a dead calm
and a dense fog. Early on the morning
of Monday last the North Farallon
loomed up less than 200 yards away.
Luckily there was but little way on the
vessel and the crew, by bracing the yards
up sharp, managed to get her away from
the danger point. â¢
The Melanope has completed her first
round trip for her new owners, J. J. Moore
& Co. When she last came here the cap
tain had died at Panama. The woman
who passed as his wife had died soon aft
er a start was made for San Francisco
and the bark arrived here in charge of
the mate. There was a lot of litigation
over both vessel and cargo and finally
both were sold at public auction, J. J.
Moore being the purchaser.

1 frwy^a HE Kosmos liner Iseko and the

1 gyll arrived from South and Cen-

The^Neko comes from Hamburg
and touched at all ports on the Pacific,
while the Argyll comes from Panama di
rect. The former brings but a small gen
eral cargo, while the Argyll is loaded
down with merchandise from New York.
Both vessels docked soon after arriving
! and began discharging, the Neko at the
; seawall and the Argyll at Fremont-street
wharf.
The Neko was nine weeks coming from
Hamburg and brought the following
named cabin passengers from South
America:
P T Estrado, S. Bellows, E. Tobler, Dr.
1 Broduax, Dr. Bowles, A. Canessa, E. Van der

Chairman McMillan of the steering
committee said to-night that he still felt
confident of the outcome. He claimed that
the tactics pursued by the Cummins fac
tion in forcing the break from Herriott
Â¦would prove a boomerang and would cost
Cummins more than he had gained.
"We shall certainly control the organ
ization of the convention," he said.
"There is no longer any doubt of that,
and the report of the committee on cre
dentials will be sustained by the conven
tion. After we have shown that we are
in control of the convention we can agree
upon whom shall be nominated."
The defection of Herrlott's men is con
sidered to practically settle the nomina
tion in favor of Cummins. His opponents
conceded to him early in the evening T5C
votes on the first ballot, while he claimed
791. The break to-night, even by the ad
mission of his opponents, gives him 828
on the second ballot, while according to
his own estimate he will have at least S47
on the first ballot and a total of 869 on the
second, while but 821 votes are necessary
to a choice.
CEDAR RAPIDS. Iowa, Aug. 6.â The
combination against Cummins was
broken to-night by a large number of the

candidate. They will bring to Cummins
an Increase of fifty-six votes on the
first ballot and seventy-eight on the
second.

"To the cry that this is a white man's
State," said ho, "we answer that the
negro bogey will scare no man. It is dis
pusting but humorous: it is a sham and
fraud: it is without force. The sugges
tion that more than SO per cent of the
white population of the State is in jeop
ardy from any standpoint from the less
than 20 per cent of negro population is an
insult to a brave and intelligent people,
who are Justly proud of the glory of their
State. There has never been a time when
there has not been a white man's govern
ment in Maryland, and as the percentage
-of colored people has steadily decreased
in the State each decade since 1810, when
it was 3S.22, to the present time, when it
is but 17.18 per cent, the puerility and
absurdity of crying aloud a white man's
government Is apparent."
Both nominations were made by accla
mation, no other names coming before the
convention. Interest, therefore, centered
mainly in the platform and the speeches,
all of which teemed with denunciation of
Democracy in general and former Senator
Gorman in particular. The "whites
supremacy" Issue raised . bv the Demo
crats in the platform adopted by them at
last week's convention was ignored in the
declaration upon which the Republican
candidates will stand, but it came in for
unfavorable mention in the speeches.

Contract for a New Corporation.
A suit involving the sale of the Clare
mont, University and Ferries Railroad
Company of Berkeley to the Transit Com
pany of Oakland was , filed yesterday by
C. J. Bruschke against Alvinza Hayward.
Bruschke demands $100,000 damages for al
leged breach of contract.
Bruschke alleges "that on May .8 last
Hayward contracted to sell him 401 shared
of the capital stock of the railroad com
pany. A payment of $500 was made on the
contract, Bruschke avers, the further con
sideration of $3000 being . due on July 8.
On that date Bruschke alleges he was
ready anfl willing to pay the sum named
for the stock, which would give him con
trol of the road, but Hayward refused to
deliver the same.
Attorney Bert Schlesinger, who with
Judge Denson and:.William T. Hubbard
represents the plaintiff, stated last even-
Ing that the road was worth $100,000 . to
Bruschke, who is establishing a furniture
factory in Berkeley. After the first $500
was paid on the agreed price of $3500 Mr
Schlesinger says the Transit Company of
fered Hayward as high as $50,000 for the
road,- being anxious to use it as a link in
the belt line, and Hayward accepted the
company's offer. v . â¢
Bruschke now sues to recover what he
considers his actual loss.

Mall advices from Xew York say: The spot
ni?.rkct for both loose and seeded raisins was
contiderably higher and more active yesterday,
as a result of the sale of the entire remaining
holdings of the raisin association â said to be
600 cars of loose â to the Seeded Raisin Com
pany at 3%c on the coast. It is stated the
entire quantity purchased Is to be seeded and
disposed cf before the new crop comes in, if
possible. sTnd the seeding combine has named
a price of Cc. f. Ov b.. coast, for 16-oz cartons.
Each carton is to bear a sticker which, how
ever, will differ from the one now In use on
cut-price raisins In that no price will be men
tioned thereon. The trade has been for some
litile time expecting the 6ale of this big block
cf raisins to the seeding company and the
deal had been to eoim extent discounted. As
high a price as 6c for the seeded stock had
not been looked for, hoyever, the general ex
pectation having been that the quotation would
be from Si-ieSHc. At 6c the trade probably
will net be eager to take hold, although stocks
cf seeded en the spot are light and there Is
a very fair demand. Sales of a number of
cars were reixirted, however.
Coast seeded raisins on the spot advanced
to 6Â»,4i7%c for cartons, according to quality,
Â¦while 3-crown loose Muscatels were I4@%c
higher at the close. Loot? raisins are in very
light supply in this market and the scarcity,
with the cltan-up on the coast, led to a rather
cctive buying movement on the spot, a num
ber of lots, mostly less than carlots, being
picked up around l\,c. At the close few lots
were offering at 5%c. Spot stocks have re
cently been considerably depleted by sales of
carlots to go to Philadelphia.

NEW YORK. Aug. 6.â General conditions, in- i
dependent of the strike situation, received |
more consideration to-day than for some time (
and were reflected In higher prices for securi
ties. The absence during the greater part of
the day of any sensational strike news, com
bined with the support which the United
States Steel stocks received after their opening
weakness, also aided the improvement. These
conditions underwent a radical change/. In the
final dealings when a report was current that
orders Tor a general strike of the steel workers
would be issued to-night. The professional
operators promptly put out large short lines
and brought about declines of from l.to about
3 points In the most prominent stocks. The
market in detail practically showed a pretty
steady improvement from the outset, the only
real setbacks which were forced by realiza
tions being quickly overcome by a good de
mand for both accounts and evidences of In-
Side support. London's attitude was regarded
with some interest, but arbitrage operations
proved small and were without Influence. News
front the crop regions was more encouraging
and was supplemented by the weekly Govern
ment crop report, which indicated Improved
conditions at important points. The outlook
for a large crop of epring and winter wheat,
in lddltion to some exceptional railroad earn
ings, also helped to sustain prices. Support
was noticeable for stocks which were especially
weak yesterday, these including the Eastern
trunk lines. Southwestern*, Tractions and Pa
cifies, where improvements had been made .of
fron: 1 to 3% points. Sugar felt an early re
sumption of yesterday's weakness, but after
losing a point sold up four. All these gains
were considerably reduced during the late Bell-
Ing movement and net gains were limited to
fractions. Trading in the steel stocks was
comparatively light, and there were not many
large individual blocks. But 6000 shares were
dealt, in at the opening at a gain of % per
cent. The stock soon yielded''% below yes
terday's close, but later on got % above and
ended unchanged for the day. Pressure was
noted against the preferred right from the
Etart. but after yielding % it got % above
yesterday's final figures and ended with a
loss of %. Money rates ruled easy to-day
and the chief feature of this department was
the debit of $1,392,198 by the sub-treasury at
the clearing-house this morning on account of
, drafts drawn against gold deposited at Pa
cific Coast points en route from the Klondike.
Foreign exchange rates were firmer to-day, de
mand bills bringing $4 87%, with the demand
only moderate.
Railroad bonds were quiet to-day and the
price movement was Irregular. Total sales
Â»1.07Â£,0C0.
The closing of the stock market was â¢ weak,
with business In increasing volume. United
States bonds were all unchanged on the last
call.

Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
Almost everything under this, head is in
much better shape than a fortnight ago. The
recent remarkable sales of Prunes and Raisins
have pretty well ' cleaned up the market for
these two descriptions, and given prices a
much firmer tone. The Prune crop will be
very light everywhere, and the official can
vass of Sonoma County by the association
shows only 25 or 30 per cent of a crop there.
The Santa Clara Valley is also very light.
The demand for Apples. Peaches and Apri
cots continues heavy at firm prices, and. Pears
promise to open high. There is no talk ot
Plums or new Prunes yet. Nuts are very firm
and new Almonds are bringing much higher
prices than expected, as already mentioned.
Honey is rather quiet, but prices are steady.

OATSâ There is a lively demand for the
drought-stricken regions of the West and if
the railroads will make a rate large shipments
overland from this State will result. The situ
ation is explained under the head of Barley.
The market rules firm and sellers make no
concessions. The demand in the city market is
not very brisk, but as, previously mentioned
the Government is in the market for 4000 tons
of old Oats for Manila, and this, with the
Western demand mentioned above and the
speculative inquiry already spoken of, tends to
render the tone quite . firm. Prices are un
changed at 95c@$l 02% for Black and 97%c@
$1 15 per ctl for Red.
CORNâ Chicago was easy and somewhat
lower, there being a disposition to go slow
pending the Government report. Private crop

BARLEY â A good demand, has sprung up for
the drought districts in the West.- Free ship
ments overland have already been made from
the southern part of the State and dealers say
that if the railroads will make a rate at which
they can ship there will be a very large move
ment for this account from the central and
northern districts. They are now in consulta
tion with the railroad companies. The market
is steady under this possible new demand, but
prices show no advance. The local market for
Feed continues very quiet.

LOS ANGELES SUMMARY-Heavy rain in
eastern mountains and valleys Sunday. Apri
cot drying about over; yield better than was
expected. Early peaches are ripening rapidly.
EUREKA SUMMARYâ Fogs were of tome
benefit to growing crops, but on high lands
vegetation is parched and needs rain badly.
Apples are ripening rapidly; some are on the
market. Reapers arc at work in the Â«rain
fieWs.
The treather has been generally clear and
hot durinp the week, with light showers In
com 1 ? sections and fogs along the coast. In
some places orange trees are putting out a
fiecend ret of blossoms and the 'small oranges
are tailing; there will be a light crop in the
vicinity of Pomona. Walnuts are reported in
excellent condition in Ventura County, but are
cropping badly in SMne orchards In Orange
County Peaches will yield a fair crop in
E'jme sections. Grapes are in excellent con
dition. Beets and beans are doing well and in
fome pieces will yield excellent crops. There
Is a fair yield of mustard in Santa Barbara
County. The potato crop is about average.
Barley and oats are yielding fair crops, but
\vheÂ£t is lieht.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Very warm and scrr.ewhat sultry weather
prevailed during the week, with a light sprinkle
of rain in most sections Wednesday, too light
to do damage. The grain harvest is progress
ing rarid!j", and <n most sections is nearly
or quite completed. Deciduous fruits are ripen
ins' end in most sections the crop is good ana
the quality excellent. Peaches and pears are
being handled In large quantities by the can
.neries. Large shipments of green fruit are be
ing made to Eastern points and of melons to
the Kortlnrcst. Grapes are making good prog
ress and early varieties are being marketed.
Alfalfa iE doing well and In some localities the
fourth crop is being harvested. Stock of all
kinds are in tood condition.-
SAN JOAQUIX VALLEY.
Continued warm weather during the week
has been favorable for crops. Light showers
of rain have fallen in some sections and fogs
have prevailed along the coast. Grain harvest
and thrashing are progressing rapidly. Wheat
and barley are cf excellent quality and in
some rlaces the yield is very heavy. Corn,
heps and beans are doing well and will yield
fair crops, while in other places the yield will
be very light. Fruit shipments have been
eeriously interfered with during the week and
there will probably be a considerable loss to
crchardir-te. Citrus iruits are in good con
dition.
AND BAY SECTIONS
High temperatures have continued during the
week. Light rain has fallen In the foothills;
in some places the precipitation was sufficient
to extinguish the brush and gra^s fires, but
caused no injury to crops. The extremely hot
weather has caused a rapid growth of hops
and they will mature earlier than usual. So
far as reported there has been no injury to
prapes by the heat, probably owing to the
heavy foliage of the vines. Heavy shipment*
of fruit are being made from Sacramento.
Citrus fruits are in excellent condition and
will probably yield heavy crops. Harvesting
Is still in progress anJ will continue for about
two weeks in som; sections. Wheat and bar
ley are yielding large crops and the quality of
the grain ii- excellent. The hay crop Is light
in portions of Butte County.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.
Grain harvest is i-tlll in progress, though
rapid'.v drawing to a close in most sections.
Wheat, barley and rye are yielding excellent
crops in all sections except Southern Califor
nia, and fair crops are being gathered in some
jiarts of the south. The fourth crop of alfalfa
is being cut in portions of the San Joaquin
Valley. Hops have made very rapid grrowth
curing the hot weather and will mature con
siderably earlier than usual; there will be a
good crop. Corn, beets and beans have also
advanced rapidly and good crops are predicted.
Irrigation water is getting low in some sec
tions, but is still abundant in the San Joaquin
Valley.
Conditions were very favorable for fruit dry
ing during the week. Deciduous fruits are
generally of good quality, but the yield is
much below average. Orchardists will suffer
a considerable loss through lack of transpor
tation facilities. Grapes are in good condition
in r.early all sections, but it is reported that
the yield will fall below average. Citrus fruits
er.d walr.ute are in good condition in most
Places
Nearlv normal weather conditions have pre
vailed in all parts of, the State during the
vetk. The temperature has continued high in
the interior, and warm weather, with oc
casional fogs, has prevailed along the coast.
L:^t showers have fallen in some sections,
mostly in the foothill districts.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Aug. 6.â While the Liverpool 'mar- |
ket showed -some advances -it was disappoint- <
Ing when compared .with the bulge in wheat
here yesterday. In addition it was- believed
the recent heavy movement to the other side
would show a decrease when the seaports were
heard -from. These . considerations in a re
stricted market had their natural effect at the
beginning of business, September opening
Vb@ ] /4c under yesterday at,70%@70%c- On cov
ering a small line of short wheat the price
was run up to 70?sC^within- five minutes of the
opening. For- some time .thereafter the tone
was weak, sympathy with corn and the heavy
receipts being depressing factors. Â¦ Selling was
oh an extremely moderate scale, but prices did
not steady until September was quoted at
69%c. A sharp rally to 70%c followed on re
ports of heavy export Â¦ sales, but the absence
of confirmation, of - these reports , resulted In
an equally sharp decline to. 70c and the close
found the market weak, September %@%c ua
der yesterday at IQQ'VAc.
Nervousness caused a rather narrow flutter-
Ing of prices in Â¦ the corn market, but while
messages from . the West were of the usual
gloomy tenor the feeling that all drought dam
ages : had been liberally discounted was the
ruling factor in the market. - The volume of
trade was small. September corn . closed lc
under yesterday at 56%c.
With purely local conditions governing sen
timent the oats market ruled dull and nar
row. September closed %c lower at 34%c.
Provisions . for September delivery ruled dull
and easy in sympathy with lower hog prices
and also with corn. Pork closed 20c lower,
lard 12%c down and ribs 10@12c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
The Butter market maintains the advance
with which the week opened, but the movement
is not brisk and there is sufficient here to meet
all current requirements.
Cheese continues firm with moderate sup
plies. .
Eggs are slower since prices were so sharply
marked up, but dealers report sales at full
figures. Stocks are lighter than they have been.
Receipts were 31.000 pounds I of Butter, 743
cases of Eggs. 3000 pounds of California Cheese.

0the dead. The festival usually begins with
the sound of chains being dragged over
the chairs and furniture. After about an
hour of this the tumult seems to change,
then resembles that produced when people
break up , housekeeping, accompanied by
the dull thud of falling timbers and crash
ing glass. Then follow in quick succession
until daylight a series of blood-curdling
moans, gramaphone selections and cornet
solos, above which can be heard the omin
ous rush through the air of the winged
spooks. It is all a great strain on Mr. Mc-
Inerney's nervous economy.
That the spooks are trying to break him
up in business Mr. Mclnerney does not
doubt. He has seen himself go to bed
with a great pile of bill-posters alongside
of him, but in the morning they had all
disappeared. For this reason he has been
charged by his employers with destroying
the bills, no results having followed their
outlay Jn -advertising. He -hates to have
his honesty impugned and his slumbers
destroyed, hence the arrest.

Auditor Wells requested his attorneys.
Lloyd & Wood, yesterday to furnish him
with an opinion regarding the legality- of
the tax levy for last year. The levy in
cluded a tax for interest and sinking funds
on park, school, sewer and hospital bonds,
which were declared invalid by the Su
preme Court. "Wells is inclined to the be
lief that, the whole levy may be invali
dated, because of the illegal tax for the
bonds. He. thinks that when property is
sold to the State for non-payment of taxes
the owners thereof will have good legal
ground for resisting the sale. He is about
to file his report with the State Controller
and will embody therein the opinion of
his -attorneys. ~ ..

Ar contest Is on over the guardianship ot
the limited estate of Catherine Ryan,
now an inmate of Napa Asylum. Mrs.
Ryan was divorced two years ago from
John Ryan, who is now in Australia." '
After her reparation from her hus
band. Mrs. Ryan began to fail mental
ly. A few days ago she was committed
to the asylum. Following Mrs. Ryan's
commitment. Mrs. John Pettee. president
of the Universal Service Society, applied
for letters of guardianship upon her
estate, which consists of about J60 in bank
and an income of $10 a week, from rela
tives in England.
An opposition to Mrs. Pettee's petition
was filed by Miss S. L. Morris. Mis9
Morris asserts that prior to her com
mitment Mrs. Ryan, who felt that she
was failing mentally, asked her to care
for her son and for herself if anything
happened to her. Miss Morris' assertion
is corroborated by Mrs. Ryan's son.
Arthur I* Hartridge, and by a Miss "Whit
ney, a friend of the unfortunate woman.
The case was called for hearing by Judge
Dunne yesterday, but was continued on
the motion of counsel until a week from
Thursday.

F. Beck was formerly the dairyman at the
State Hospital for the Insane and resided with
his wife on North Ophir street. In July ha
went to San Francisco, intending later to take
a trip East. A few days ago he sent his wife
a small money order and she went down to
Join him. She Is probably In Alameda, where
she has relatives. Beck was an industrious
man and his friends here believe he must
have met with foul play. He had some money.
There was also found on the body a
picture of the deceased dressed as a sol
dier. -
East Sunday Lorenz found a half
emptied box of rough on rats about 200
feet from where the body was discov
ered, also a half-filled bottle of whisky
containing a portion of the deadly poi
son. From his statement the Coroner
came to the conclusion that Beck, who,
it was said, lived in Stockton, had com
mitted suicide.
The following dispatch from Stockton
gives facts as to Beck's character that
do not coincide with the suicide theory:
The body was that of a person about 40
years of age. It "was clothed In a blue
serge suit and a black soft hat. On each
cuff was the name "F. Beck." In one of
the pockets was found a money order re
ceipt showing that the man had drawn
$7 from the Stockton Postofflce on July
19 last.
George Lorenz, "who is employed at the
Sutro Baths, last evening found the body
of a middle-aged man near Sutro Heights.
He at once notified the Coroner.
Friends Think He Was Mur
dered, Though Suicide
Is Probable.

shook a real dramatic thrill out of the

DENVER. Aug. 6.â A special to the
Xews from Santa. Fe, N. M. t says: Farm
crops on. both the east and west slopes
of the Glorieta range have been destroyed
by the flood. Fences were washed away
and along Torreon Creek the corn and
oai fields are strewn with driftwood piled
five feet high. Between Glorieta and
Lamy the public highway is practically
obliterated. Just above Canoncito the
Galisteo's swift current was eighty feet
wide and twenty feet deep. At numerous
points the railroad track is undermined
for hundreds of feet. The heavy piling
and timber guards that have protected
the roads for. years in the canyon half a
mile east of Canoncito are destroyed.
In some places the rails and ties for 150
feet are suspended in midair twenty feet
above what is now tj^ creek bed. The
two sixty-foot spans of the steel bridge
at Canoncito were carried down stream
sixty feet and now lie bottom-side up
half buried in sand. The famous well at
Canoncito was entirely filled with gravel
and wash. From all indiciat'ions it will
require at least five days to repair tho
roadbed between the top of the mountain

The bride was exquisitely gowned in a
princess robe of ivory white satin, made
with a very long train and elaborately
trimmed with Brussels lace and tulle. A

orange blossoms, adorned the left side of
the skirt, while a drapery of tulle, held
in place with orange blossoms, outlined
the edge of the train. The bodice was
made with lace yoke j and sleeves and
draped with tulle and orange blossoms.
Real orange blossoms held the long tulle
veil in place. The only ornament worn
by the bride was a splendid fleur de Us

sparkled in her hair. The shower bouquet
carried by the bride was of lilies of the

sage and hair. They carried shower bou
auets-of pink sweet peas. The brides
maids were Miss Mabel Gage, Miss Ethel

evening of Miss Elizabeth Stan

of Stephen. T. Gage and one of . the most

.The invitation list was a long one and
scores of society people returned during
the last' few days from the summer re
sorts to be present at the wedding. Â¦
Preparations for the event had been
made on an elaborate scale at the Gage
home on Harrison street, where the cere
mony and reception took place, and the
result was striking and artistic. Green
and white prevailed, an occasional sug
gestion .of color being given with pink
roses and sweet peas. In the embowered
bay-window in the drawing-room a large
white wedding bell hung, beneath which
the young couple knelt during the mar
riage service. The Rev. Robert Ritchie,
rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church,
officiated. " ' '

MRS. DELLA ROGERS. A COLORED MEDIUM, HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR DISTURBING THE SLUMBERS OF
ANGUS McINERNEY. WHO SAYS HIS REPUTATION HAS SUFFERED THROUGH THE OPERATIONS OF
SPOOKS REGULARLY EMPLOYED BY THE ACCUSED.
It" is expected that the gunboat Machals
will start in a few days, . and it would
not be surprising should Rear Admiral
Casey be directed to send one of the ships
of his command to Panama. Thus the
United States will have on both sides of
the isthmus warships which will be able
to protect not only the terminus of the
railroad, but to land men for the purpose
of traveling on trains and of preventing
an interruption of traffic. ,
Officials of Colombia in this city are
rather glad the incident has occurred.
The moral effect of the intervention by
the United States in isthmian affairs will
be great. Â¦Â¦'Â¦r-.S'-'V-;-. - .
"Liberals detained for one hour a pas
senger train at Matachin this morning.
Captured some Government officials. No
looting, no damage."
The treaty in force between the United
States and Colombia imposes upon this
Government the duty of efficaciously and
positively preserving perfect neutrality of
the isthmus, "with the view that free
transit from one to the other sea may not
be interrupted or embarrassed." In or
der to maintain free communication it is
necessary that an armed force should be
sent to Colombia.

N. W., WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â An in r
terruption of transit across the isthmus,
which the American Consul in. Colon said
last week was threatened by operations
of the Colombian guerrillas, has occurred
and it will now become necessary for the
United States to take action to prevent Its
recurrence. The interruption was short,
only one hour, yet it establishes a prece
dent which this Government cannot afford
to overlook. The facts of the incident
were communicated by Consul General

CHICAGO. Aug. 6.â Judge TVilliam Cecil
Price, United States Treasurer under
President Buchanan, died here to-day at
the home of his son-in-law, "William S.
Newberry. aged S6 years. _.__,. , r
Judge Price settled in Springfield, Mo.,
in the early 30s. An ardent believer in
slavery, he became prominent in the ranks
of the' Democratic party and when Buch
anan was elected he was given the keys
cf the Treasury. '
When Buchanan ordered Major Anaer-
Fon to reinforce Fort Sumter Judge Price
believed the South was being betrayed and
resigned his office in anger. He was with
General Price at the battle of Pea Ridge
and was captured by the Federals and
confined in the prison at Alton, 111., until
September. 1SC2. when he was exchanged.
Judge Price has been in ill-health for
some time owing to his advanced age and
the end was not unexpected. The body
will be taken to Madison, Wls., for inter

The Citizen Hook and Ladder Com
pany was organized September 16, 1876. It
has had among Its members most of Ala
meda's prominent citizens, including
Judge John Ellsworth, Fritz Boehmer and
the late John Leise.
The action of the hook and ladder com
pany leaves only four volunteer hose com
panies in the department. . The "hose
wagons manned by these companies all
have paid drivers and in case of their
withdrawal there will be only one man to
each. A hook and ladder company, is ab
solutely necessary. Â¦ â¢â¢ Â¦
The City Trustees were surprised at the
document and even Chief Krauth did not
know it was coming. President Forderer
said' it meant that the city would soon
be compelled to organize a paid depart
ment, but he could not see where the
money is coming from at present.
. Resolved, That we. the members of Citizen
Hook and Ladder Company No. 1, do hereby
mutually agree to disband, and thereby close
our services as volunteer firemen of the city
of Alameda on the 31st day of October, 1901,
at 12 o'clock midnight. Â¦
Whereas. We believe the city of. Alameda has
arrived at a period In wealth and Importance
when it is fully capable of providing for all
departments' of the - municipal -.service; and
whereas, Citizen Hook and Ladder Company
No. 1 has at all times kept up an active mem
bership and a full complement of members,
never less than fifteen (13). which number ! is
at present enrolled; and whereas. Citizen Hook
and Ladder Company No. 1 has given a quar
ter of a century voluntary service to this city
and its eitlzens, we believe that we should now
retire in favor of a paid department. There
fore
ALAMEDA. Aug. 6.â The City Trustees
were astounded last night .when .they re
ceived ; a communication from Citizen
Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 an
nouncing its Intention to withdraw' from
the volunteer flre' department at the end
of three months. As the company has
always , been the most active in the de
partment and the one organization that
kept the J volunteers together, the City
Trustees look upon this action as/the be
ginning' ' of the end of the volunteer aer
vice. The communication from the com
pany, which was in the form of resolu
tions passed at its last meeting, follows:
Beginning of the End of
Volunteer Service in

Considerable commotion was caused at
the ferry last night by John McGee. a
long whiskered old man, who scattered a
crowd of several hundred people with a
toy cap pistol and gave Officer Henne
berry a chaseÂ»for several blocks.
McGee is a laborer on the water front
and last night imbibed considerable fire
water" in the maritime resorts. After
leaving a saloon on East street, near Mis
sion, he was attracted by the crowds at
the ferry and soon leaned against one or
the pillars observing the people come and
go A number of boys commenced to poke
fun at him and, passing in a line, each
pulled his whiskers, which were long and
forcczv
Finally the old man became desperate
and pulling a glistening .weapon from his
pocket flourished it. The crowd of pas
sengers was just landing from an Oak
land boat and the pistol wielder darted
among them threatening to send every
body to the Morsue. Women screamed
and men rushed abort pellmelL A call
for the police was sent to the Harbor Sta
tion and Officer W. Henneberry respond
ed When the policeman came upon the
ooene McGee started to run and did not
stop until the minion of the law was upon
him at Market and Drumm streets. Mc-
Gee placed his weapon against the offi
cer's breast and snapped the trigger, but
he did no harm, for the gun that had
scared the crowd was only a toy cap pis
tol. " '

â¢ I get it from San Jose that the inside bat
tle going on in San Jose, .where the push at
both ends are most interested, is the coming
city election. This, of course, is to be the
preliminary to the Governor's contest a month
or two later. Now Mackenzie has Greenlnger
programmed as his candidate for Mayor.
Greenlnger Is , now trustee at the i Agnews
Asylum, holding since Budd's time. Gage has
not. reappointed* him because of his record.
Gage has passed the word at the State Normal
School at San Jose and at the Agnews Asylum
to stand for Â¦ Mackenzie against Rea. Rea
don't know this, but it is a fact. You could
get this news by approaching the doctor at
Agnews if that was net Gage's order to him.
Also -that Herrin has said Rea was expensive
and that he had to renew Rea's annual for
Mackenzie. Mackenzie told Rea he was to get
his. Herrin wants Bond of Santa Clara for
State Senator to succeed Shortrldge. Bond Is
Herrin' s personal friend and is programmed.
Sam Shortridge told Herrin he wanted Charley
returned, but he had Gage hand Charley the
Loan Commissioner to let go - for Bond. The
owner of the San Jose Mercuryâ he is from
Oregon â is Herrin' s, man. He traveled ylth
Herrin East in Â¦ a private Â¦ car and â¢ It - Is said
that Herrin is part owner In the Mercury.
These things. Rea is just finding out and that
The true business In regard to the San
Jose fight is shown in a letter written by
a well-posVed politician. The Call is per
mitted to publish this extract from the
letter: : /â¢â¢. . -.-.
When bosses fall out the honest masses
get inside information. The fight for bess
leadership in San Jose is disclosing some
interesting facts. Jim Rea objects to being
laid on the shelf and inventoried as a back
number by Johnny Mackenzie. It is com
mon knowledge in Santa Clara County
that. Mackenzie was once an understudy
in Rea's aggregation of push politicians.
It appears that Herrin and Gage took
quite a fancy to Mackenzie. In smooth
ness Mackenzie excelled. He is as "smooth
as salad oil," says Herrin. Lynch. Dibble
and Jere Burke lose no opportunity to put
in a good word for Johnny Mackenzie at
railroad headquarters. Rea has been get
ting the rough end of every deal for some
time past. â¢ 'â¢' . . . -

said John "W. McCarthy, secretary of the
Fire Commission, yesterday, "and neither
Kelly nor Rainey will have the services
of any employe of the Fire Department on
the day of the primaries or prior thereto.
"The commission has gone so far as to
deny vacations during the first half of
August, that none of the men may get a
period of freedom in which to do politics.
"When a sick leave is asked the board
requires the certificates of two physicians
before the applicant's request for a lay-off
on' account of disability is granted; then
the person securing the leave must remain
in his house during the whole period he
is off duty. The ofllcers of the department
are required to call upon all sick men to
see that they are so confined, and I visit
them myself and report to the board.
"From now until after the primaries
every fireman in the San Francisco de
partment who Is able to perform his duties
will be housed in and those who are sick
must stay at their homes. No politics
will be done by them.
"President Watt personally issued or
ders for the captains that their men
should be allowed just time enough away
from the houses on primary day, except
in case of fire, in which to cast their bal
lots; that any man staying longer without
permission would lose his place, and that
any captain who gave a man leave to stay
away longer on the day of the primaries
would be removed. These orders are abso
lute and any dlsobeyal will result in a loss
of position. Chief Sullivan and his imme
diate subordinates have been cautioned to
see that the orders are obeyed. There will
be no fireman doing politics for the bosses
on August 13."
It is evident that the Phelan machine Is
not going to allow the Fire Department
to be used by its old master, Rainey. The
Phelan combine can never itself win the
love of the men on the.fire company rolls,
but it has the power "at present to keep
them locked up when Rainey wants work
done and seems determined to do it.
Mr. Harrison was in favor of proceeding
with the election, but the members were
desirous of hearing from his lips how
the club has progressed during the past
year. He told of the obstacles that con
fronted the present, board when they en
tered office, of unpaid bills and an out
standing indebtedness of $29,000; delin-.
quent membership and lack of credit. He
then dwelt on the work of rehabilitation
and told how the board had brought the
club to its present high standing and of
the improvements effected during the past
year.
Colonel Beck then placed Messrs. Leigh
ton, Hale, Hewson, Melrose and Cunning
ham in nomination. Mr. Gleason seconded
the nomination. Clement Bennett moved
that nominations be closed and the regu
lar ticket was thus selected by unanimous
vote. . .
President Harrison called the meeting
to order and directed Secretary John El
liott to read the sectoina of the by-laws
under which the meeting was held. The
chairman* then appointed H. J. Crocker
and Mr. Thornton . tellers. Their services
were unnecessary, as there was but one
ticket in the field.
It is a foregone conclusion that the fol
lowing officers will be unanimously, elect
ed at the coming election: "William Greer

mittee. It was expected there would be
opposition to the regular ticket because
certain members 'were said to be> opposed
to George James* as captain of the. club.
The friends of James rallied to his sup
port in such numbers that the opposition
did not utter a word during the meeting.
By unanimously : selecting Charles J.
Leighton, -. Edward Hale, Nat Hewson,
Charles Melrose and John T. .Cunning
ham to act as a nominating committee
the members of the Olympic Athletic
Club last night gave their officers and di
rectors-a hearty indorsement for the
splendid work theyhave done during the
past ' year. The selection of the regular
nominating committee Â¦will ' result in tne
re-election of the entire board. .This is
what the members want, if their action

There was a large assemblage of the
Republicans of the Thirty-sixth Assembly
District at the club-room on Guerrero and
Twentieth streets last, night. The two
branch clubs, the one at Twin Peaks and
the one of the eastern end of the district,
met and made their- nominations of.dele
gates. With the view of producing' har
mony between the two clubs the Grand
Hotel representation gave the eastern
club the right to name its thirteen dele
gates, the other thirteen being named by
a conference committee from both -wings
of the clubs. This policy proved satis
factory to all parties, and all the dele
gates were nominated. They are:

The question of holding a mass meeting
on the night previous to the election was
discussed and the matter was left, in the
hands of the executive committee for
action.
Captain Lees suggested that each dele
gate personally work to secure two
friends to be on duty at the polling booths

p*"[T< HE success of the Republican Prl
11 mary League tickets a-t the polls
I next Tuesday will insure a pro
il gressive and . honest administra
tion of municipal affairs under
the auspices of the Republican party. All
the signs of the hour point to utter defeat
of the allied bosses. It Is noted with
special delight that several of the inde
pendent clubs have welcomed fusion with
the district organizations of the league.
Last night all the anti-boss elements of
the Thirty-sixth ana Thirty-eighth dis
tricts combined. This fusion will accom
plish the defeat of the bosses in these
two important districts. Last evening
when Max Goldberg heard of the union
of all the anti-bors elements in the
Tiiirty-eighth he sallied forth to find
John C. Lynch. Before midnight all the
bosses knew that their last hope of divid
ing the anti-boss forces in the district
had vanished. , ,
Consternation was created in the ,boss
camp when the news spread that all the
elements of good citizenship in the Thir
ty-sixth District were consolidating to
down the boss ticwet next Tuesday.
Last night ten of the Republican Pri
mary League district tickets were filed in
the Registrar's office. The remaining tick
ets will be filed to-night. Boss Kelly hied
six of his tickets yesterday. He is hav
ing trouble to find respectable men who
are willing to lend their names to -his
ticket. Surprise was expressed last night
that G. W. Kingsbury, proprietor of the
Lick House had permitted his name to
head the Kelly-Crimmins ticket in the
Forty-fifth District.
Leading citizens who do not want their
names associated with those of corrupt
bosses should take the earliest opportu
nity to scan the boss ticket in their re
spective districts. Time remains for
good citizens to withdraw from all sem
blance of sympathy or fellowship with
corrupt political rounders.
The rooms of the Republican Primary
League were densely thronged last night.
The intense interestâ an interest greater
than ordinarily S attaches to a general
electionâ signifies an unusually large vote
next Tuesday.
Encouraging reports come from every
district. It is regarded as sure that
Kelly will be defeated in the Twenty
eighth District: Money is offered in^
wagers that Kelly and Crimmins will.be
beaten out of sight in the Twenty-ninth
District. In the Forty-first District Dib
ble is endeavoring to rally the demoralized
boss forces, but is making 'no headway.
In the Thirty- fourth and Thirty-fifth
districts the bosses dare not put up a
ticket. â¢ = . â¢
The indications at this time point to
anti-boss success in the Twenty-eighth.
Twenty-ninth, Thirty-first, Thirty-second,
Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, Thirty-fifth,
Thirty-sixth, Thirty-eighth, â¢ Fortieth,
Forty-first, Forty-third, Forty-fourth and
Forty-fifth districts. >
At the headquarters of the Primary
League it is claimed that every dis
trict will be won. Candidates who were
on the fence at the beginning are now
seeking anti-boss favor.

Mr. Bergez, when seen, said that pov
erty should not have led Grogan to such
a desperate measure, as he had hundreds
of friends in this city who would have
been only too glad to assist him if his
pride would have permitted him to have
made his wants known. â¢
Grogan, whenever he said anything at
all about his past, always claimed that he
was related to a noble family of Europe.
Just before taking his life he write to
John Bergez of this city, telling of the
deed he had under contemplation and giv
ing ill health and poverty as the causes
that resulted in the tragedy. Inclosed in
the letter was his card, which reads:
Alejandro E. Grogan, Baron de Norden
flycht.
Finally Grogan's funds began to run
low, and some time ago he bade good
by to his friends, telling them he was
going to Chile, where he expected to re
coup his fortunes. This was the last heard
of him until yesterday's dispatch printed
in The Call told them of his sad end in
the little village where he had lived for
gotten within a couple of hours' ride of
the city where he had once reigned a
prince.
It was a little, very little, item in yes
terday's Call. So short was' this tele
graphic bit of news that told of the self
inflicted death of an elderly man at Los
Gatos, that It may have escaped the no
tice of those who hastily skim over the
pages of their paper between the break
fast hour and the daily trip to the office.
Yet to those of the old-timers who did see
the article in question it evoked a host
of reminiscences which carried them back
to the palmy days of bonanza excitement,
when every mans pocket was lined with
the rich product or California's golden
lulls, iina wnen San .Francisco was the
second city or importance in the world 01
Bohemiaâ the other one being Paris.
'ihe man who Killed himself by taking
a dose or prussic acid was Alexander hi.
Â«jrogan, or *\L,ittle iirogan," as he was
known to the multitude of friends that
were His when everything was coming his
way f when he was the miniature Beau
Brummel of the world that lives by gas
light and ttie arbiter elegantiarum among
me boys who set up late.
Grogan, during his latter days in San
Francisco, was a man of over 50 years
of age. His carefully dyed hair, pertectly
ntting clotr.ee, trim figure and generally
well groomefl appearance, however, so
well assisted time in the effort to preserve
him that he hardly looked to be more than
iO. To most of his friends and acquaint
ances he was a complete mystery, and
even his older and more intimate com
panions can now recall but little concern
ing him.
St'hough his name was Grogan, of un
doubted Celtic origin, yet the man himself
was certainly a continental " European,
though from what part of Euro'pe he came
was impossible to tell, as he spoke half
a dozen languages with equal fluency. The
name of Grogan came to him from Dr.
Alexander Grogan, a wealthy physician of
early days, by whom he was adopted. The
physician died leaving a fortune verging
close to a million, but this adopted son,
owing to an estrangement that took place
between the two men shortly before the
doctor's death* was cut off with about
a hundred thousand dollars, and on this
sum he started out to continue his career
as a good fellow. His wide knowledge
of the world, his thorough acquaintance
with all the accomplishments of - a bon
vivant, his wit, generosity and general
good nature had already made him a
warm favorite, and for a long time he
was one of the most sought after men in
the city.
