GREAT AUDIENCE AT METROPOLITAN TEMPLE GREETS

DEMOCRATS HOLD FINAL RALLY
AT METROPOLITAN TEMPLE AND
GREAT ENTHUSIASM IS DISPLAYED
Joseph S. Tobin Receives Grand Reception From
Big Crowd Which He Addressesâ T. C. Van
Ness, W. J. McGee and F. H. Gould Also Speak
BONFIRES biased away at the ap
proaches to Metropolitan Hall
laÂ«t night, a band played "See,
Our Conquering Hero Comes '
and a large and enthusiastic
audience cheered wildly as Jo
seph B. Tobin stepped upon the
stage.
A number of hoodlums who were no-
ticed a few nights* ago at a Democratic
rally in Metropolitan Hall appeared at
last night's rally and attempted to dis
turb the â¢ speakers. They were ignored
however, by the speakers and trie big
crowd.
It was the final rally of the Democratic
campaign, and there was so much genuine
enthusiasm for the Democratic candidate
for Mayor that the hoodlums finally sub
sided and listened intently to the address
or Mr. Tobin, who was frequently ap
plauded throughout his address.
A portrait of Mr. Tobin bearing the In
scription "Of the people and for the peo
ple" was hanging over the stage. Frank
H. Gould was addressing the audience
when Mr. Tobin entered the hall. With a
great wave of enthusiasm the greater
part of the crowd rose to their feet,
wavt:d their hats and handkerchiefs and
cheered lustily.
When Mr. Gould had concluded his ar
raignment of the Republican party, and
not only explained how the ticket nomi- |
nated by it Is dominated by corporate in
fluence, but answered the statements
ma<3<> on the rostrum a few nights ago by !
S. Su. Shortridge, Mr. Tobin was intro
duce 1.
Several rowdies cheered for Schmitz,
but Mr. Tobin was perfectly at ease and
stood upon, the platform smiling upon his
friends until absolute quiet reigned.
Hit epeech was in the nature of a dig
nified! statement of the main issues of the
Campaign. He explained to his hearers
to his concise and logical way his ideas
of government and won great applause
throughout, especially when he stated
that if elected Mayor he would see that
the eight-hour law would be enforced In
every department of the city government,
the Police Department as well as all
others of the municipality. His speech
throughout was an earnest appeal for
votens to be thoughtful and vote for the
re-election of those men who have proved
themselves to be true to the Interests of
the city.
There was no self about Mr. Tobin's ad
dress. It was simply a sober and manly
appeal to the people to vote for good gov
ernment.
T. C. Van Ness, who was Introduced as
< hairtnan of the mass meeting, delivered
a masterly address on the issues that are
now confronting the people. So did W.
J. McGce, while Frank H. Gould not only
held his audience's attention with a
scathing arraignment of the methods of
Republican bosses, but threw It into a fit
of laughter by the picture he drew of [
Samuel M. Shortridge, the principal orator
in tho Republican campaign. The picture
he dr 2w of Shortridge was more interest- |
ing than that from any cartoonist's pen..

SCENE AT THE FINAL TOBIN RALLY OF THE CAMPAIGN HELD
LAST NIGHT IN METROPOLITAN TEMPLE AND' SOME OF THE
SPEAKERS THAT TOOK A. PROMINENT PART.
1 this meeting to-night is called as the final
'â¢ rally upon the Democratic Bide of the
i house. This is the last opportunity we are
to have to express in good old Democratic
fashion the reasons for the faith that is
; in us; the reasons why the Democratic
; party is entitled to the suffrages of the
Â¦ people of this city; the reason why the
| vote of every thinking man, be he Re
' publican, Democrat or laboring man,
should be cast for the nominees of the
party that we are here to-night to speak
j for. (Applause.) It is proper that those
reasons should be given, and given pub
licly, fearlessly and in the open.
"San Francisco to-day faces a great
j opportunity, and upon the result of this
j election depends and will depend to some
' considerable extent the question as to
; whether that opportunity is to be taken
' advantage of, or whether, through sloth
, fulness or lack of attention to public af
lairs, it is to be thrown to one side. You
know, as I know, that the coming into
the Union of the Hawaiian Islands, the
taking under the American flag of the
Hhilippines, the developments that are
j taking place to-day in the Orient, are at
tracting to the city of San Francisco the
< yes Of the civilized world. Great steata
hip companies are beginning to estab
\ lish themselves here, transcontinental
I railroads are looking for routes through
the mountains to find their way into the
city by the Golden Gate; capital is think
. ing whether this is a place to invest; the
I skill, the intelligence of able enterprising
1 people of the world who go tq make mod
i em civilization are looking to-day to San
| Francisco as the central point from which
! for the next ten years the great opera
! lions of this world are to take place.
(Applause.)
Shall We Remain a Village?
"Shall we build or shall we tear down?
Shall we advertise to the world that we
I are a community that understand our
j selves and are in the forefront of the
i march or shall we remain a village simply
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1901.
on the western shore of the Pacific Coast?
You know, as I know, that San Francisco
has rivals to the north and rivals to the
south; and you know that you can make
no mistake that will not be taken ad
vantage of by every penny-a-liner and
every man who has a dollar's worth of
goods to sell in some other community
than that in which we live.
"You know, as I know, that one of the
necessary things to make a great city, to
give confidence to the people who are of
you, or who will be of you, is the correct
solution of the problem that is before us
within the next three or four days, to wit:
Are we to have a government for this
city such as we ought to have or are we
to put into office the tool, the creature of
interests that are adverse to us? Are we
to do that which will destroy confidence,
or are we by putting in an efficient and
honest administration to Build it up?
That is the question that you as citizens
of San Francisco will have to answer at
the ballot-box on Tuesday next.
"Gentlemen, no man need to make a
mistake, no man need to go wrong upon
this occasion for want of light and infor
mation, for the sunlight of truth is shin
ing upon the issues that are before you
and shining down upon the men who are
seeking your suffrages.
"You have three parties before you, you
have three sets of candidates who are
seeking your votes. The Republican po
litical machine is to-day, as it never has
done before, working in the straight open,
without disguise and without pretense
and without any claim to being anything
else but just a simple, plain ordinary po
litical machine hunting for the loaves and
fishes and trying to get into office that
they may subserve the selfish purposes of
the people who own them. Can the
preacher be any greater than its creator?
Republicans Not the Noblest.
"Will the gentlemen who stand upon the
Republican, ticket be better or nobler or
GRAVE DANGER
CONFRONTS THE
MUNICIPALITY
THERE is danger of
Schmitz's election to
the office of Mayor.
Unless Republicans
put aside party inclinations
and give their support to Jo
seph S. Tobin the calamity of
Schmitz's election cannot be
averted. Republican mer
chants and business men
should no longer hesitate in
the face of the common peril.
. The boss talk that Schmitz is
deriving his main support
from the political party to
which Tobin belong-s is uttered
to cloud the judgment of the
conservative citizen and cre
ate the belief that there is a
chance of Wells' success. The
Call invites special attention
to the significant facts that
Schmitz is a Republican, that
he is a director of the Repub
lican Primary League and that
his confidential managers and
his most effective workers are
Republicans. Tobin's ener
getic canvass has brought
back to the party which nomi
nated him for Mayor many
Democratic workingmen, but
Wells has made but feeble ef
fort to win Republicans away
from Schmitz.
Ordinary political issues cut
no figure in this local contest,
hence Republicans are freely
justified in putting aside par
tisan feeling tc save San Fran
cisco. It is common knowledge
that Democratic citizens have
risen above party to save the
country. Cannot Republicans
give an example of civic pa
triotism to save the cityP
purer or more public-spirited than the two
or three gentlemen who in the back room
of one of the principal professional offices
of this city have created them? You
know they won't. You can make no mis
take about that, because the Republican
ticket to-day is not representative of Re
publican thought; it is not representative
of any Republican principles; it is not
representative of anything that is for the
good of this community, but it represents
the gentlemen who put it into the field
and who intend if they can to carry it
through to success. (Applause.)
"You can make no mistak^ in regard
to the candidacy of the men who are
upon the Union Labor ticket. Their can
didacy, good or bad, frought with good
or evil to this community, is before you;
what is intended is publicly announced
from rostrum and in the press, and what
they are, and what they mean to be, and
what they mean to do they frankly and
openly state, and you can't be misled or
deceived. Â«
"So that if you cast your vote for the
one or for the other you are doing it in
telligently, and 'if you do that which is
to the injury of San Francisco to-day you
do it with your eyes open, and you can't
pretend afterward that you have been
humbugged or fooled with the molasses
that is cast in front of voters' eyes by
the political manipulators. (Applause.)
There is no manipulation this time; there
is absolutely no manipulation that you do
not know.
"Now, gentlemen, in this coming elec
tion what do you need in the form of a
government? What is a good government?
A good city government is one which will
reduce taxes, which will give us good
parks and streets, which will honestly ad
minister the affairs of the city and county
of San Francisco and which will make it
safe for every man, woman and child who
lives under the protection of that govern
ment to live within the law and, living
within the law, to be absolutely as free
to go and come and do within the law as
he pleases, as if there were no govern
ment at all. That is what a good govern
ment means, and any government that
gives a man less than that is no govern
ment at all.
Republicans' Not a Free Ticket.
"Let us turn now to our Republican
friends, because we are to show you to
night if we can why they ought not to
be voted for. What is there in the Re
publican ticketâ what is there in the can
didacy of the gentlemen who are upon
that ticket to induce any intelligent,
thinking man in this city and county to
cast his vote on Tuesday next for the
nominees who head that organization?
"Did that ticket come out of a conven
tion of American citizens? Is there a
candidate upon that ticket who, prior. to
the time that his name was sent to the
convention by the men who arranged it,
had ever heard of a majority of
them or that had the slightest idea who
the nominees were to be? Is that ticket
the result of a free, open American con
vention such as we ought to have?
"You know it is not. You know that a
half dozen gentlemen, banded together for
selfish purposes to promote selfish inter
ests, have fathered and mothered the can
didates, and from such fathers and moth
ers what can you expect but what you
have got? (Applause.)
"Let us turn to the head of the ticket.
For Mr. Wells personally I have a high
respect. I believe that Mr. Wells is in

WELLS BOOMLET GOES UP IN AIR
AND CONSERVATIVE VOTE SHOWS
DISPOSITION TO UNITE ON TOBIN
Republican Bosses Send Out Reports to Give
Impression That Their Candidate Leads, but
Polls Show Democratic Nominee Is Favorite
THE life is ebbing out of the little
boomlet that the Republican
bosses created for Asa R. Wells.
Some money was thrown out to
wager that Wells would get more
votes than Tobin, but the hand
lers of the coin were carefully charged
not to bet that Wells would be elected
Mayor. Instructions were given to cry
aloud in public places that there was
plenty of Wells money at the Union
League Club and Palace Hotel. The ob
ject of the demonstration was to check
the tide of desertion from Wells to Tobin
and make it appear to conservative citi
zens that the former was the stronger of
the two. Perhaps a few voters were de
ceived by the ruse, but the deception was
quickly removed when the money offered
was readily taken by the Tobin men.
In the parlance of the push "Wells is a
dead one." His boom has vanished. Tho
Republican managers have not yet con
ceded the election of Tobin, but they have
acknowledged the defeat of Wells by de
clining to bet one dollar on the election
of their candidate.
False Reports Spread.
Claquers were sent out from boss head
quarters day before yesterday to circulate
the report that ex-Mayor E. B. Pond, a
leading business man and prominent
Democrat, was giving support to Wells.
Mr. Pond was seen in his office on Cali
fornia street yesterday and this interview
took place:
"They say at Republican headquarters,
Mr. Pond, that you are going to vote for
Wells and advise your friends to vote for
him."
Mr. Pond replied: "I am not going to
vote for Wells and I am not advising my
friends to vote for him. He is too big a
load for me to carry. lam going to vote
for Tobin. Yes, you can publish it. "
False stories to the effect that other
leading men of the conservative class in
tended to support Wells were freely circu
lated under instruction of the bosses, but
names were not given. The effort to pre
vent an alliance of business men and
property owners in support of Tobin is
failing. Indications are that a union of
conservative elements in favor of Tobin
will be formed to-day.
Polls Show Tobin the Favorite.
The Mills building offices were polled
yesterday with the following result: To
bin 43, Wells 3-S, Schmitz 38.
In the Crocker building the poll gives
this complexion: Tobin 29, Wells 23, Schmitz
7. In the Parrott building the vote stood:
Tobin 66, Wells 50, Schmitz 37. A poll was
taken in the Western Meat Mar
ket, the American box factory and the
Southern Pacific freight sheds with this
outcome: Tobin 89, Wells 77, Schmitz 101.
Front and Battery streets from Market
to Washington were polled and the vote
stood: Tobin 144, Wells 129. Schmitz 67.
Last Tuesday the Federal Grand Jury
was polled and the return was: Tobin 16,
Wells none, Schmitz none. The Builders'
PRI(*E FIVE CENTS.
Exchange vote stood: Tobin W. Well* 20,
Schmitz 35.
If W. F. Herrin, who is managing
Wells' campaign, doubts the accuracy of
the foregoing polls and wishes verification
let him appoint a representative to go
over the same field with a representative
appointed by The Call. Any one he may
appoint, other than Crothers of the Bui
letln, will be acceptable.
Germans Vote for Tobin.
A ballot for the most popular candidate
which is being taken at the Grard Jublleo
Fair now in progress at the San Francisco
Turn Verein Hall gives evidence that Jo
seph S. Tobin has a strong following
among the German people. The voting
thus far has resulted as follows: Joseph
S. Tobin 55, Wells 42. Schmitz 19, Lack
mann 25, Boland 28. Brandenstein 19, Box
ton 4 and Dahlbender 1. The randidate
who is declared most popular will be
awarded a silver mounted cane.
A straw vote taken at Ryan's handball
court on Howard street resulted: Tobin 4J,
Wells 6, Schmit* f.
Registrar Walsh has issued the follow
ing notice for the benefit of voters in gen
eral and election officers in particular:
All citizens who registered in the years 190Â»
or 1901 and still reside within the boundaries
of the same precinct are entitled to vote, and
will find their names upon the precinct register.
Al! election officers sworn in at the City Hall
are earnestly requested to report to the In
spectors of their respective precincts not later
than 5:45 o'clock. Tuesday morning, Novem
ber 5, 1901.
Election officers will take notice that the in
dexes and registers sent to them contain the
corrected registrations, together with supple
ments thereto, and will carefully examine sup
plements attached to each volume.
Voters should be careful not to vote for mor*
than eighteen Supervisors nor more than two
Police Judges.
WELLS MONEY PROMPTLY
TAKEN BY TOBIN MEN
Sum of $3000 Is Wagered That Re
publican Candidate Will Not
Be Elected.
A statement in last evening's Bulletin
that $3000 of Wells money was witting at
the Union League Club to be taken by
Tobin backers had not been given pub
licity more than half an hour when that
amount of Tobin money in three sacks,
each containing $1000 in gold, was dumped
upon the office desk of F. H. Corey, secre
tary of the club, with the announcement
that it was to cover the Wells money on
an even bet that Tobin would defeat him.
The Tobin supporter was informed that
Secretary Corey, who had possession of
the Wells money, was out and that the
bet could not be made in his absence. Thu
Tobin man notified them that his money
was ready to be wagered against Wells
money wherever Or whenever it might be
found, and that in case he found no othei 1
takers in the meanwhile he would make
the bet upon Secretary Cory's return.
Secretary Corey came back later and tile
wager was accepted and the money locked
up pending the decision of the Ttners. JIM
Tobin backer said at the same time that
he had $7000 additional to bet on :he same
condition. He also offered to fcer. $1000 to
$200 that Wells would not be elected, but
the wager was not accepted by any of the
Wells men present.2

HOLE WEXLS WENT THROUGH.
W. J. McGhee Tells of It and Amuses
Audience.
W. J. McGee spoke as follows: I am here
to submit to the candor of your consideration
a few plain truths as to wherein I believe
that you will best serve the interests of your
self and your city, your families and your
firesides by casting your franchises oh next
Tuesday in favor of the ticket beaded by that
fearless advocate of Democracy and good gov
ernment, Joseph S. Tobin. (Cheers.)
I concede to every loyal citizen of this munci
pality that he wants to see every dollar of
tribute taken from the pockets of the people
in the shape of taxes honestly and economically
administered and expended; that he want* to
cc improvement in all its forms keep march
with the growth of the city; that he wants to
Â¦cc established and maintained here a social
condition ihst -we will not be ashamed of when
compared with the conditions existing- in other :
communities.
These high considerations, my fellow citizens,
in my humble judgment, are to-day threatened
by two impending dangers; on the one hand
we have the danger embodied in the ticket
that was brought about and vas the direct
result of the bitter feud growing out of the
great commercial strike that recently rent this
city almost in twain.
Republican Is Class Ticket.
My friends, as I said before, there are a
number to follow me and I want to hasten
on. There is another danger to these consid
erations that to my mind is as great a danger
as the other and that is the danger presented
by the Republican ticket. This ticket is Just
as much, or almost as much, a class ticket
as the other, because it represents that
very high and exclusive class of the bosses
and the allied corporations of this city.
My friends, Mr. Wells, for whom I have the
Â¦very greatest respect, every night before he
pops out to address the multitude must' read
the inscription above the figure of ljbertv on
the American dollar, because he is continually
asking the people to take him on trust.
<L*uehter and applause). Above the figure
en our dollar is written the lines "In -God we
trust"; but I thought all of the candidates for
office were strictly cash. (Laughter.)
Mr. Wells comes before the people of this
city and offers them a promise; Mr. Tobin
offers them a record. Mr. Wells offers the
people a platform of glittering generalities;
Mr. Tobir. offers the people a platform exact
in all its meanings.
Mr. Wells refuses to discuss any of the issues
of the day; Mr. Tobin has an opinion on every
issue that concerns the people and is willing
xo ypeak out that opinion. (Applause.) â¢
Mr. Welis talks to the people about where
he has lived in San Francisco, what he drinks
and what good things he has at home to drink:
Mr. Tobln. on the other hand, talks about
what he proposes to do i:" he is elected with
the Geary-street franchise, with the rate of
taxes, with water rates, gas rates, telephone
rates and with the Mission railroad. Why, my
friends, Simple Simon fishing for whales in his
mother's rain barrel and occasionally drawing
forth in great glee a pollywog is only a real
istic picture of Mr. Wells in discussing the
live Issues of the day.
Wells Had One Fixed Opinion.
Mr. Wells did have a fixed opinion on one
question, and that question was as to the hon
esty and capability of the present Democratic
Board of Supervisors. But a few months ago
be said, in speaking of this board, that It was
the best Board of Supervisors that San Fran
cisco has had for forty years. (Applause.) After
his nomination, after he had condemned his
own candidates for Supervisors, he attempted
to qualify this -declaration, and now says that
the Board of Supervisors was honest, but that
the charter made them honest. (Laughter )
I always knew that the charter was a very
virtuous instrument, but I have never heard
before even its most earnest advocates claim
that it could make men in office honest and
capable. If it can do this, it not only exceeds
the laws of Moses but even the ten command
ments themselves.
I Fvbmil to you that that is a very email
hole for the bosses' candidate for Mayor to at
tempt to crawl through. So one car. see how
lie mot through that hole, it is even a smaller
hole than the tanner's calf was supposed to
crawl through. A tanner, if you will pardon
the digression, as an illustration, once owned
a tar.ntry in the suburb* of the city. He was
In r.eed of a sign for his tanning establish
ment and he conceived the idea that a calf's
tail thrust through a knothole in the Fide of
his building would make a very appropriate
jsirn. So he acted accordingly. '
The Â¦airs tail had not been thrust through
the knothole very long until an old farmer
came along with his good wife driving to
tewn past the tannery, and when the old
farmer espied the calf's tail sticking: through
the knot hole in the side of the tannery he
was greatly excit>id. and thus ejaculated: "Gee
whiz, Marie, if 1 can see how that air calf
What are Humors?

crawled through that air knot hole." (Laugh
ter.) Mr. Wells is on the other side of the
knot hole, but nobody can say how he crawled
through. (Renewed laughter.)
This Is a Critical Day.
In conclusion let me submit to you, gentle
men, that this is a critical day in the political
history of Ban Francisco. I appeal to you. and
especially to my friends in the gallery, don't
throw away your votes on next Tuesday. Do
your duty, and do your whole duty; and if you
do this, when the last ballot shall have been

GOULD MAKES GREAT ADDRESS.
Likens Republican Ticket to a Bed
One in Philadelphia.
Frank H. Gould paid a caustic compli
ment to both Samuel M. Shortridge and
Asa R. Wells when he said in the course
of his interesting speech:
They have selected a man magnificent in
the stature of a giant; a man magnificent in
mental attainments: a man oratorical to a
fault; a man who has all of the ability both
of expression and intelligence to present to
tny audience the strongest claims that any
political party might make for the considera
tion of the citizens of the city wherein he
liveis. This gentleman needs no introduction
by name to you. He presented himself a week
cr co ago upon this rostrum, as well known
a* any man in the State of California, ad
mired, respected and loved by the people, and
his name is the Honorable Samuel M. Short
ridge. And I want you to applaud Sam.
Applause.)
Now. then, he also had another qualification
that was necessary for an advocate of this
character, and that is the devotiun to his
party, for when he was discussing these ques
tions before you he turned to his aged friend
who stands at the head of the ticket and he
said, "In him I see only the leader of my
party, and wheresoever he goes there will I
iollow."
My fr'ends, I cannot understand how my
friend Mr. Shortridge could have made a state
ment of that character, because I believe him
to be a man of bright mind and of great
patriotism, qjid I believe that any man who
utters the expressions, who gives voice to- the
principle that he will follow the leader of his
i.arty wherever he goes is placing the con
duct of hip party above the devotion that he
owes to his country.
Foemen of Progress.
I say whatever influence may dominate a
party, whatever crowd may obtain control of
a convention, for a man to say that notwith
standing all that he follows wherever they
go although it be in the hands of freeboot
ers, why. men of that kind are warts on the
tail of progress. A man of that kind, my
friendsâ but I do not include Mr. Shortridge
because he is not that kind of a manâ but men
of that character have banded together re
cently in the. city of Philadelphia, and there
but a short time since in the course of a great
campaign, one of the Republican orators there,
I am credibly informed, made this statement
1 roni a rostrum :
"Boys," he said, "stand by the ticketâ hold
your nose and vote the ticket in order thac
we may have protection."
What was the result? The result of that was
that before these people had been in office
very long there came before the Council an
order for the giving away of the franchises of
that great city and they were given away and
within two weeks after the gift was made for
nothing two great benevolent men of this
country said to the city of Philadelphia that
they would give 12,500,000 for the very franchise
that had been given away in a Â«ingle night.
Now \heee gentlemen who present themselves
in the form of a Republican party I should say
tro the Philistines in this engagement, and
Mr. Shortridge stands for them as their Go
liath. In the first place he Â«ays that this
government of which we are proud has dono
r.fthinp. What has it done? The Assessor
fleeted upon the I>emocratic ticket at the last
election has added to the assessable- property
< f San Francisco $23,000,090. placed upon fran
chises In San Francisco, of which not one dol
lar had been assessed before. (Applause.)
Work of the Assessor.
That means that from the shoulders of the
ether people who have in the past paid taxes
would be lifted an amount equal to about
4235,000 per year. Another thing: During the
last two or three years the Assessor elected by
the administration now In power has added to
the taxable property in the shape of personal
I-roperty that has never been apsessed before
the sum of forty millions of dollars which
added to thÂ« twenty-three millions gives us
.-ixty-thrte millions of dollars added to the
property of this city which never
assessed before, the taxation thereon
annually amounting' to the sum of $674 000
I want to call your attention to this fac*
that if a Board of Supervisors subservient to
the corporations whose franchises have been
taxed by this Assessor should be elected they
sitting as a board of equalization would ha\'e
lower at the behest of those who elected them
to wipe out the good work of your Assessor
and replace upon your shoulders the taxes that
these people now JuÃtly bear. (Applause.)
Therefore, I say. It behooves you to look well
to the ticket you elect for Supervisors at the
cominz election.
TOBIN THANKS HIS AUDIENCE.
Bids Them Good-By With Assurance
of Victory.
Mr. Tobin's speech was as follows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladles and Gentlemen: I
stand in need of the indulgence of this au
dience. I have spoken night after night three
to five times a night, and I trust that what
I may say will not be subject to any undue
criticism.
A duty has been performed. A campaign for
Civic virtue U all but completed. We stand
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1901.
FIFTY THOUSAND GIVEN
TO WORTHY CHARITIES
yt ' N unprincipled attack on Joseph S, Tobin is brought to public attentio-n. The Bulletin last
evening reports that Dr. J. F. Gibbon made this allusion to the Tobins at Palo Alto Hall
Thursday night: "The Tobins are very charitable zvith other people's money; they gave
$50,000 of our money to the Valley Railroad as a free gift; they had no more right to give it than
I would if I had that amount of your money in my charge. When the Valley -Railroad sold out to
- - the Santa Fe Railroad the- money zvas returned in stock or cash, and teas not returned to the Hiber
nia Bank reserve fund, where it was taken from, but was placed in the Crockcr-W oolworth Bank,
where it remained."
It may interest the" voters of San Francisco to know what became of this gift of $50,000,
which zvas returned when the Santa Fe bought the Valley road. The sum of $25,000 zvas donated
to the Catholic Orphan Asylum; the sum of $12,500 to the Protestant Orphan Asylum, and the'sum
of $12,500 to the Hebrew Orphan Asylum.
San Francisco got the railroad and the orphans got the money. Wilt the defamers of Mr.
Tobin please spring something else to assist in his election?.
here this evening looking forward with hope
and aspiration. We have thrown into this cam
paign youth, vigor and enthusiasm and pa
triotism and. ladles and gentlemen, the air
pulsates and throbs with the hope and expecta
tion of victory and success. (Great applause.)
This ladies and gentlemen, is no seinsh
struggle. When the tomb of Christendom was
in danger all Europe flocked to the standard
of a poor hermit. When San Francisco is in
peril where shall the citizens of San Francisco
be found but beneath the banner that repre
sents honesty, independence and conservatism?
Patriotism knows no partisan. Civic virtue is
the birthright of Â«very man. The young Greek
that dashed from Marathon to Athens with the
breath of victory on his lips was not stopped
at the gate wh'.le his captors investigated
whether he was a free man or a slave. I>adies
and gentlemen, do not stop to investigate
whether a man is a Republican, a Democrat or
a labor unionist, but see whether he bears
upon his brow the stamp of an honest Ameri
can citizen. (Applause.)
I am amazed at the inconsistency of some
men who up to this time have based their
principles of politics upon altruistic unselfish
motives. Now, we meet them on the streets
and we say, "Who are you going to vote
for?" and they say, "Well, I am a Republi
can, " or "I have been a Democrat," or all
such talk as that. In Â»ast times these same
gentlemen, like Diogenes, have gone through
the world with a lamp seeking an honest
municipal administration, and now when the/
are confronted with such an administration
and it seeks their indorsement they hesitate
and falter and refuse to answer.
Every Man Is Interested.
Gentlemen, this is no time for the discussion
of political economy or for discussion of the
underlying principles .cf' government. There
is nothing here, gentlemen, but the discussion
of a business proposition. Every man who
pays his taxes, who sees his money go into
the City Hall every six months, is interested
i the discussion and in the decision of this
campaign; Interested not as a. Democrat, not
as a Republican, not as a labor -unionist, but
as a citizen anxious to preserve the good name
and future prosperity of this city. (Applause.)
But they say, ladies and gentlemen, we are
opposed to corporationsâ we are inimical to
the Interests of corporations. I stated at the
outset of this campaign that no corporation
lias anything to fear from the nominees upon
this ticket. What the law says they shall de
mand of ur that -^hey shall receive in full
measure. They shall be treated just as fai-rly,
just as conscientiously, with just as much re
spect for their rights as the poorest, the low
est citizen in this land and they shall be
treated thus and in no other wise.
Gentlemen, we have incurred the opposition
of some corporations, but those .corporations,
what they are and who they represent and
they have stood for in the history of San
JPtancisco, you know. We have incurred their
wrath, but we have done them no injustice. If
v.c are elected, gentlemen, every business in
terest In San Francisco, every conservative in
terest in San Francises, will be fairly, hon
estly and justly treated and no man can es
cape from the responsibility cast upon him at
this time for voting the Democratic ticket by
the cry that we will abuse vested interests or
impair Vested rights. (Applause.) Let every
man remember how the SantaJ^e Railroad has
been treated by the present Board of Super
visors. Let every man who Is Interested in
corporations remember that. And jupt as fairly
and as honestly as we treated them we will
treat every other corporation and every other
interest in San Francisco. (Applause.)
Fire Deupxtment Out of Politics.
I was told to-day that we are opposedâ and
I cannot say that I regret itâ that we are op
posed through the Fire Department by Mr.
Rainey. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not be
lieve the Fire Department will lend themselves
to any such scheme as this. In days gone by
the members of the Fire Department â remem
ber how they were placed in power and their
tenure in office â depended upon the nod of a
man who sat in the rear of a stable or in
the back room of a saloon. They know now
that their tenure of office is secure, that they
cannot be discharged or displaced without a
fair, open trialâ and I don't believe that any
man in San Francisco can use the present Fire
Department to oust the present Rdministra
tion or to prevent an honest, fair administra
tion of San Francisco's affairs. (Applause.)
And while 1 am on the subject of depart
ments I want to say that if elected Mayor I
will see that the eight-hour law is enforced
in every department of the city as it is en
forced at the present time In the Board cf
Public Works. (Applause.)
I will see that the eight-hour law is enforced
in the Police Department as well as In every
other department.
When a mariner has been tossed for many
days in thick weather and upon an unknown
sea he naturally avails himself of the first
pause in the storm, the first ray of sunshine,
to take his bearings and ascertain how far
the elements have driven him from his true
course. Let us do this, ladies and gentlemen
From now until election day let us recall the
issue of this campaign. It is now as it was
three weeks ago, the clean, honest adminis
tration of municipal affairs. If it were aught
else I would not be here.

TOBIN ADDRESSES TWO
ENTHUSIASTIC MEETINGS
His Reception Gives Assurance of a
Sweeping Success on Elec
tion Day.
In addition to speaking at. the big final
Democratic mass-meeting in Metropolitan
Hall Joseph S. Tobin last night addressed
two gatherings in widely separated parts
of the city. He spoke at the Potrero
Opera-house and talked to an enthusiastic
gathering of citizens of the Forty-fifth
Assembly District at Garibaldi Hall.
The work outlined for ..the evening and
the long distances to be covered neces
sitated an early appearance at the Po
trero. In spite of that fact, however, and
cf the further fact that Schmitz was play
ing an oratorical engagement in the im
mediate neighborhood, the opera-house
was well filled and the candidate was ac
corded a rousing reception.

was received with cheers. His remarks
were received with the same enthusiastic
interest which has been displayed at every
Tobin meeting of the campaign.
The candidate for Mayor spent the early
part of the day in the south of Market
street district. He visited the glass works
and wherever he went was met with as
surances which point to his election next
Tuesday by a comfortable majority. His
friends are more confident of success than
ever and Tobin himself feels well satisfied
with the situation.
He was Introduced at the Potrero by-
John J. Barrett, who, in what he called
"a few plain parting words before you
discharge your duty in the voting booth,"
referred to Tobin as a man whose train
ing as legal adviser of an institution of
magnitude and importance almost the
equal of the municipality, particularly
fitted him for the office of Mayor.
Tobin spoke in part as follows:
I am not unaDpreciative of the kind words
Mr. Barrett has spoken, but I want to assure
you that the position I hold at this time is en
tirely due to the force of circumstances. I take
no particular credit for the measure of pros
perity which has fallen to my lot. I appreciate
it, but I fall to see that I have done more
than any other young man would in similar
circumstances.
Mr. Barrett has been good enough to speak
of my people and my character. I want to
say that there is no family in this district
any lowlier in station than was mine. My
father was a poor man. He knew all about
the dark side of a poor man's life; he knew
all about the bitter struggle that falls to the
lot ol! the man that has to labor for a living.
Sympathy with the laboring man was bred in
my bones and any man that says I do not
sympathize with the laboring man is mistaken
and whoever says I am not fit to represent him
says that which is not true. I defy my enemies
to point to any single act In my private or
public career inimical to the interests of the
workingman. I stand before you now just as
much a young workingman as any one in this
audience. The ticket at the head of which 1
have the honor to stand is just as much for
the workingman as any ticket in the field.
We have increased laborers' pay at the City
Hall to $2 50 a day. We have Insisted on hav
ing the Allied Printing Trades label on all-clty
printlnjr. We have* enforced the eight-hour iaw
in all contracts directly or indirectly controlled
by the citx. have given you a 2VJ-cent car
fare for school children. We have reduced
your taxes and your gas and water rates. I
ask any other party now* seeking your suf
frages to show me on the statute books any
single proof that they ever did a single thing
for the direct benefit of the workingman.
The meeting at Garibaldi Hall spoke
volumes for the sentiment toward Tobin
in the Forty-fifth District. There was no
occasion for bonfire or brass band to
kindle the enthusiasm. He was greeted
as a personal friend and given a parting
cheer which he said afterward would
make him feel always that in that part
of town he was In the territory of his
friends.
He spoke as follows:
In the course of this campaign I have en
deavored to confine my discussions to the
presentation of business principles. The prin
ciple involved in this campaign Is the same
as Induces a man to put and keep his own
house in order. This Is a duty which every
ir.an worthy of the name recognizes as im
perative. As with your household, so with
your city. I'pon you, therefor, citizens of San
your city. Upon you, therefore, citizens of San
Cisco clean and beautiful, that It may be at
tractive to visitors, and honest. In this there
Is neither Democracy, Republicanism nor
trades unionism involved. The issue in this
and any other municipal campaign is the elec
tion to office of men that will discharge hon
estly the duties of their several offices. It has
been our' aim in this campaign to speak to
you as business men to business men.
The question which confronts you Is Will
you keep your civic household clean? Will
you elect to office men capable, honest and
free from corporation control? or will you fill
these offices with men about whom the experi
ence of the past tells you nothing?
As San Francisco la well governed and or
derly so will you bo prosperous and thrive. We
have no time now to talk politics. This is
not a question of politics. We bring you the
record of our administration for the past two
years. In this and our platform you must
find what we hope to do for you In the future.
Do not be misled. You have been well
governed for two years. The next two years
is in your hands.
After the meeting in Metropolitan Hall
Tobin visited by invitation a high jinks
of the Eagles fn B'rai B'rith Hall and a
social gathering nf Pueilic Parlor of the
Native Sons in Native Sons' Hal!.
He will address a meeting at 12:30 to-day
on the United States transport dock, foot

eral meetings this evening.

Republican meetings were held in the
Richmond district, in Hayes Valley and
at the Alhambra Theater. The largest
audience was found in the Alhambra.
Even there the building was not half filled,
and many of those present were women
and children.
Wells first spoke last night in Richmond
Hall, Clement street and Fourth avenue,
which is situated in the Fortieth District.
As at the other meetings where Wells
appeared the small boys of the neighbor
hood made merry around the bonfires of
railroad ties and added their voices to the
half-hearted cheers that greeted the Re
publican nominee for Mayor.
Wells Appears in Bichmond District.
John T. Williams presided at the meet
ing in Richmond Hall and James M. Wil
kins, candidate for Supervisor, received a
hearty welcome. A. B. Mahoney. candi
date for County Clerk, also received an
ovation and short speeches were deliv
ered by other candidates.
Wells In addressing his audience said:
My friends: A few years ago I had no idea
that I would be able to address a meeting
at this place, and particularly so large a meet
ing of Republicans. Many years ago I used
to drive out over the Point Lobos road. Thm
place was a long- ways from where I lived
down en Sansome street. I said then some
time this would be a great city out in this
direction. At that time it was rolling sand.
A great many people thought that sand never
could be controlled. It was iike the snow
on the eastern hills, but they found that the
sand could be controlled, and that there was
a very large and conservative good people in
the neighboorhood of these hills. I am glad
to meet you. I don't know that there is any
thing in particular to say to you. All of thest
questionsâ the issues they call them, have been
discussed and are being discussed. The time
is too short. My ideas of the government of
this city which will be published, and 1 think
you will have a chance to thoroughly under
stand my views regarding the city's progreos
and its government and its naeds before you
are called upon to cast your ballot. I have
only appeared here for a few moments in or
der you might sÂ«e I was in the campaign. I
really think I shall be elected, and if so I
assure you that I will not forget the Rich
mond District.
Candidates Speak in Hayes Valley.
Howry's Hall was fairly well filled last
evening by the residents of the Thirty
seventh and Thirty-eighth districts, sit
uated in Hayes Valley.
George Neal presided over the gather
ing, and the audience gave hearty recep
tions to John Lackmann, J. S. Nyland,
James M. Wilkins, Fred Eggers, Colonel
Boston. Harry Baehr, A. G. Fisk and C.
H. Stanyan, all these candidates deliver
ing addresses.
When Wells appeared on the platform
the cheers were helped out by the brass
band and the small boys in the gallery.
Wells spoke very briefly, his remarks
being as follows:
My friends: I am glad to greet you as Re
publicans. I have been so many years longer
than most of you have been on earth. I was
asked by the committee to come to Hayes
Valley to look at you and I am glad to do so.
I know you are Republicans by your looks. I
cannot say much about the issues of the day.
I have given them, however, great thought and
impression, and in case I should be your Mayor
âyou know he has extraordinary powers In
the government of San Francisco, but he Is
not all. He must have good Supervisors, anC
they are the legislators of the city. If those
on the Republican ticket should be elected you
will have a good government. I do not think
it necessary to touch on the issues. I have
formulated my policy and It win be given to
you to read before you cast your vote. When
you see my declaration of policy and my Ideas
I hope you will read it with great care. 1
thank you all. Good night
Talks to German-American Citizens.
The meeting of German-American ReÂ»
publicans at the Alhambra Theater was
not a crowded one. Predictions had been
made that Wells would find the big au
ditorium crowded to the doors. But a
single row of the gallery was occupied,
and the floor showed blocks of vacant
seats. Of the long list of vice presidents
announced to be present about one-sixth
of the number were on the platform.
The audience listened to some good
speeches by candidates and others pend
ing the arrival of Wells, who received a
warm welcome from trrose present Ad
dresses were delivered by Captain Robert
Wieneke, who presided; F. M. Freund O
F. Yon Rhein. J. LJppmann, \V. SpleÂ«el
Judge Joachimsen, Albert Heyer, J f'
Plagemann, G. Hutaf and Chris Dunker'
The address of Wells was as follows -
Ladies and Gentlemen: It Is rather unex
pected to me to be here this evening. I had

Candidates Worthy of Support.
Charles F. Corey, nominee for Re
corder, is a popular and capable man,
who has demonstrated his fitness for the
public service in several important posi
tions. He was chief deputy under Al
Berthier and performed the duties of the
office in a most acceptable manner.
J. E. Barry, nominee for City Attorney,
deserves the support of citizens. His rec
ord as Justice of the Peace is one of the
best ever made. His abilities as a lawyer
are beyond question. His integrity Is rec
ognized wherever he is known. The office

ant one, but he has the ability and expe

HIS SKULL FRACTURED
BY A BLOW OR FALL
Frank Brail Found in an, Unconscious
Condition and Taken to the
Btt&pftaL
John McCallum. living at 737 Mission
street, visited the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital early yesterday morning , leading
Frank Brail, known as "Frenchy." Brail's
skull was found to lie fractured. '
Policemen Janes and Hig-h tower were
notified, and to them McCallum stated
that he met "Brail in a saloon and treated
him to several drinks. A stranger stand
ing at the bar asked McCallum for the
"price of a beer" and he offered hint ID
cents, but the stranger wanted more.
Brail advised McCallum not to give the
stranger any money, as he was a "bum, '
and McCallum put the dime in his pocket.
McCallum left the saloon, expecting
Brail to follow him. He missed him a
minute later, and turning round saw Brail
lying on the sidewalk and the stranger
disappearing up the street. McCallum
found Brail Insensible, but succeeded in
rousing him and taking him to the hospi
tal. McCallum could not recollect where
the saloon was. and Janes and Hightower
walked around with him for over two
hours, but he could not locate it. It is
supposed that the man who asked for the
money struck Brail on the . head with
some blunt instrument. As Brail was con
siderably under the influence of liquor lie
may have fallen and fractured his skull.
He is doing well at the hospital and will
recover.

BY EUGENE E. SCHMITZ FOR SAKE OF PROFITS ON CONTRACTS FOR MACHINERY
SCHMITZ TALKS
TO PEOPLE OF
THE POTRERO
Confidence of Voters in
Labor Candidates Will
in Nowise Be Abused
THE labor candidates, headed by
Eugene E. Schmitz. visited the
Potrero last night and were ac
corded enthusiastic receptions at
Penny's Hall and at the opera
house in South San Francisco.
That the sentiment for the la
bor ticket In this section Is strong was
evidenced by the large crowds that
g-reeted the labor standard-bearer. The
Kepublic&ns as well as the Democrats
who attended the meetings were con
vinced that members of the old-line par
ties must combine on Tobin If they hoped
to defeat the labor candidate for Mayor.
Addresses were made at Penny's Hall
ry Messrs. Harcourt, Murphy, Getchell,
Coghlan. Roberts and Coyle. When
fichmitz appeared he was given hearty
cheers. He spoke in part as follows:
I was convinced that the labor ticket met
with your approbation in the Potrero and your
reception has justified my belief. They are
tailing you all sorts of thing's about me and
my Â¦ ;iow candidates, but thus far they have
been unable to attack our personal characters.
They call us a class ticket. What are the Re
publican and Democratic tickets but class
tickets? They represent the railroad and
basses. You should stand by the worklngmen's
ticket because that is the party which will see
tliat your interest* are not neglected if you
place them In office. My opponents are both
rich men and how can they appreciate your
. needs? I have not the recommendation of
wealth, but I am backed by the people. That
If sufficient recommendation for me. If you
elect me as your Mayor I assure you I will not
neglect your interests. Tou need improvements
and I will see that you get them as far as It
. lie* In my power to supply your needs.
Should Support "Labor Ticket.
At the opera-house In South San Fran
cisco a large audience greeted Schmitz.
He was received with marked manifesta
tions of approval of his candidacy. He
Â«id in part:
- thank you for this cordial reception. It
proves to me that you sympathize with the
movement which makes it possible for the
workingroen to have something to 6ay about
the administration of public affairs. You
should support the labor ticket whelly, for the
candidates thereon are known and respected
5r tfaeir honesty. Mr. Tobin says the issues
of' this campaign are honesty and independence
Sn municipal government. I accept those Is
sues We have honesty on our side, and If
we are elected to office we will prove our In
dependence of the influences which at all time*
eu-round and often corrupt public officials.
'-his campaign has been an impersonal one
s' far as I am concerned. My personal char
acter has not been assailed for the reason that
' It compares favorably with that of my op
ponents and for the reason that I have lived
n upright life in the community in which I
nit** my home. If elected Mayor I will carry
ou the provisions of the charter in every re
*poct and there will be no special privileges
â¢riven to the few while the many go without.
I will be the Mayor at the people and not a
class I favor the acquisition of the Geary
*treet franchise. and I believe we should own
our public utilities. My policy will .be fair
treatment of all irrespective of conditions of
life You won't have to ride to the City Hall on
a iÂ»olo pony in order to see me. Vote the labor
tic set ttiaight and you wont have cause to
regret your action. â¢
Received by the Eagles.
Schmitz next- spoke at a meeting of
Aerie No. 5, Order of Eagles. In B'nai
B'rith Hall. The place was packed and
thÂ«? labor standard bearer was accorded
a flattering reception. He spoke briefly
and his remarks were much the same as
those expressed in the Potrero. On leav
ing this place he went to the hall above
and addressed a small gathering of sheet
irH'tsl workers. A flying trip was then
mc.de to 1113 Clay street, where a small
crowd was assembled. Owing to the late
r.<*::s cf the hour â¢ .any had returned to
thÂ«lr homes- in the belief that Schmitz
would not come. Schmitz talked briefly.
he assuring his hearers that If elected
the people of the Forty-second District
Â«^ would never have cause to regret their
'choice. He spoke favorably of his fellow
candidates and- recommended them to the
suffrage of his hearers. This closed the
evening's campaigning. (
PHOTOGRAPHS OF LETTERS AND A RECEIPTED BILL WHICH SHOW THE "KIND OF A UNION MAN THAT SCHMITZ IS."
T* /. MAHONEY of the BrotJierhood of Teamsters, one of the speakers at the Schmits meeting held on Friday night in the hall of the Sailors' Union, in the course of his
â address used these words:
"That's the kind of union man that Eugene E. Schmitz is"
The Call to-day presents photographs of three documents which should illustrate Mr. Mahoney's remark to the satisfaction of all union men.
The story told by the documents is this:
Early in June the Risdon Iron and Locomotive Works, unable on account of the machinists' strike to fill an order for certain machinery for the Oceanic Steamship
Company's steamship Alameda, offered that work to outside parties. *
Eugene E. Schmitz, not then having in prospect a place at the head of the Labor Union ticket, saw in the strait of the Risdon people only an opportwttty
to help along the Economist Gas Engine Company, the boat in which lie plows the industrial sea.
Schmitz made a bid for the work on June 12, offering to provide two ammonia compressors with engines attached for $530 each.
The Risdon Iron Works accepted his bid on June 18.
And then, while to use the words of Schmits on Friday night at Sailors' Union Hall, "the children and families (of the striking machinists) were crying for bread,"
he set the wheels of his shop in motion to do for the Risdon Iron Works that same work which the striking union machinists had refused to perform.
The next exhibit tells the story of the price paid Mr. Schmitz for doing the zvork his fellow-unionists had refused.
The object of the strike was to compel the iron works to comply with a request for a shorter day. The unions figured that being unable to get any work done the em
ployers would be obliged to grant the concession. With the aid of non-union men in their shops, however, and union men like Schmitz on the outside, the employers have so far
managed to fill orders and carry on business.
As the strike is still on, the children and families to whom Schmitz so pathetically referred must still be crying for bread.
Schmitz received $1144 53 for doing in secret the work the real union men had refused.
"That's the kind of a union man that Eugene E. Schmitz is."

LOOMIS. Wash., Nov. 1.-J. M. Hag
gerty was tarred and feathered to-day by
an indignant mob of citizens who took of
fense at his recent remarks concerning
the Palmer Mountain Tunnel Company
and its operations.
Mr. Haggerty is a Well known man in
this section. He was formerly a -news
paper man and has been interested in sev
eral mining: deals. Recently, while in

as it claimed. He deposited $50 with the
eaitor of a Spokane paper, which money

Citizens had read Mr. Haggertys state
ments and they were waiting for him
when he arrived on the stage. An im
promptu mass meeting was held in the
public square. Mr. Haggerty was accused
of giving the camp a black eye and an ex
planation was demanded. Mr. Haggertv
adhered to his statement. This enraged
the crowd and threats of violence were
heard on all sides.
Suddenly a dozen men seized Mr Hag
gerty and before half the crowd knew
what was occurring a bucket of tar and
a pillow were produced. The tar was
poured over Mr. Haggerty - head and lie
was then liberally besprinkled with feath
ers.
Escorted by about twenty men the v'c
tim was paraded through the streets for
a half hour. Then his persecutors let Mm
go. m
Mr. Haggerty scraped off such of Ihe
tar as he could and then left for his min
ing claim, about three miles from town.
.He had little to say during the tarring
and the parade, though he fought vigor
ously while the sticky mass was being
applied. Afterward he swore he would
get even with some of the mob.
There were no officers of the law in the
town during the trouble.
GERMANS TRIUMPH
OVER SACRAMENTO
Pitcher Stricklett Is Hit
Hard in the Fifth Inning,
Resulting in Many Runs
Uncle Henry's German ball players went
through the formality of playing the na
tional game with the men from the capital
city yesterday at Recreation grounds. The
fans who turned out to witness the game
were doomed to bitter disappointment
after the fourth inning. The game began
like a championship contest and ended in
a manner that would have discredited Â¦ a
band of schoolboys. Up to the fourth
both pitchers were effective, and the sup
port they received was of the gilt edge
order, so the game bid fair to become a
repetition of Thursday's brilliant contest.
Ine Wasps, however, aided by a large
bunch or nits and a coupie of costly mi:-
plays in the fifth, took an overwhelming
lead. A listless exhibition resulted for the
next five innings. . cv lor me
The Senators assumed a dangerous atti
tude in the third. Sullivan led off with
a single to left field, but was forced at
second by Stricklett. Flood followed with
an infield hit. putting Stricklett on second.
Sneehan secured a pass, and with the
bases full Courtney came to the bat Flood
began to play off the middle station, and
in an endeavor to catch him napping Wil
son threw high and Stricklett scored.
Courtney hit an easy one to Iburg, who
caught Flood at the plate. Sheehan was
soon after caught in trying to steal home.
In the fourth round little Hildebrand
sent a pretty double out ' to left field
Schwartz went out to Sheehan. Captain
Pabst followed with a hot liner to center
field, sending "Hlldy" across the rubber.
Pabst was caught while trying to make
second on the throw in.
With the Scoreboard reading one all in
the fifth the Oermans started in to do a
few things to Mr. Strickletfs polished de
livery. Krug started the annihilation and
was quickly followed by the rest of the
pretzel shooters. In all seven safe bumps
were registered, which, with the aid of nn
error or two and a couple of passes, netted
eight marks on the German side of the
book.
Not content with what they had already
accomnlished, the Wasps went after Mr
Brown. who replaced Stricken in the
sixth. The bunt was worked to a stand
still, and before the side had been retired
three more husky Teutonians went the
rout".

SCHMITZ IS CHALLENCED
TO SET FORTH EVIDENCE
/N this morning's issue of the Examiner there was published a statement given out by the ex
ecutive committee of the Iron Trades Council to which zvere attached some of the names repre
sented in that body.
We, the undersigned, on Wednesday last, published a statement over our signatures, with
out fear or favor, in which we charged Mr. Eugene E. ScJtmits with having violated his obliga
gations as a trades unionist. We made specific charges against Mr. Schmits and asked him to pre
sent his proofs in denial, namely, the books of the firms interested, as the best evidence. He has
not done so. We nozv repeat that he continued to take his castings up to Wednesday of this week

ADMIRAL SCHLEY WILL HAVE A FINAL WORD
FOR COURT OF INQUIRY BEFORE IT CLOSES
Proceedings of the Naval Tribunal Are Now Almost at an End and the
Decision Will Be Rendered Within a Few Weeks.
WASHINGTON, Nov. I.â The
hands of the antique time
piece which stands against
the wall occupied by the
Schley court of inquiry point
ed to 12:45 o'clock to-day while Judge Ad
vocate Lemly announced that he had no
more witnesses to call and Mr. Raynor
said that no witnesses would be sum
moned on behalf of Admiral Schley in sur
rebuttal.
For a moment it appeared as if the
now famous case was about to reach a
sudden conclusion. But this delusion was
soon dissipated by the announcement on
the part of Captain I^emly that he might
ask to be allowed to bring in one more
witness on Monday and also a statement
from Mr. Raynor that Admiral Schley
himself would resire to return to the stand
on Monday to correct errors in his evi
dence as officially reported.
There is probability that the admiral
will consume considerable time in going
fiver the printed record of what he said
and there also is an understanding that
he will make some additions to his former
statements. But it is not believed that
beyond what he may have to say there
will be much more testimony taken in
the case.
The only witness that the judge advo
cate still has in mind is lieutenant
Strauss, and Captain I^ehily said to-day
that if the lieutenant's attendance could
be secured he would detain the court for
a short time only. Captain Sig-sbee also
will return to the stand Monday to make
corrections in the testimony given yes
terday by him.
These details completed the argument
of counsel will begin and then counsel
and the public will withdraw and leave
the court to its deliberations. The task
before the court is not a light one and
it may be weeks before the verdict will
be reached.
To-day's witnesses were Sylvester Sco
vil, a former newspaper correspondent,
who saw service in the Cuban campaign;
Lieutenant Hood, who commanded the
H?wk during- the Spanish war. and also
a number of officers who were heard yes
terday and who returned to the stand to
correct testimony. The court he'd only
one session and adjourned until Monday.
ARRANGE ABOUT ARGUMENT.
Attorneys Announce How They In
tend to Closs the Case.
WASHINGTON, Nov. I.â The Schley court of
inquiry was six minutes late In entering the
hall this morning, this being the first time
that absolute promptness has not been ob
served. Judge Advocate L/rnly announced that
counsel had agreed on the order of speeches
in closing the case, subject to the sanction of
the court. Hanna is to open for the depart
ment. He will be followed by Captain Parker
and Raynor for Admiral Schley and Judge
Advocate Lemly will close for the department.
Adrr.iral Dewey announced that this arrange
ment was ratlsfactory to the court.
Captain Lemly then brought up the question
of the character of the argument io be made,
saying:
"I would like for my own information to ask
tho instruction? of the court as to whether
or not we are expected in the closing argument
to confine ourselves to the evidence and to
castlf. CaL, and is a pupil of Pace, who

Raynorâ Of course in making an argument
we won't pretend to refer to anything not in
the record. We are bound by that but I do
not want to have any more restrictions placed
upon my argument than I would in any other
court. I want the constitutional right to argue
this case within proper bound 6 and with great
respect to everybody concerned, but to make
criticisms as they appear proper to me, or to
make eomwrfTnt. If I should find, for instance,
that I believed a witness has not told the truth
1 should not hesitate to say so.
Captain Lemlyâ That is ri<?ht.
Admiral Deweyâ There won't be any trouble
about that. When we come to that bridge we
will cross It.
Sylvester Scovil was then called as the first
witness for the day. He said that while on
the pressboat Somers X. Smith, as a news
paper correspondent on May 27 or 28, it came
up with the St. Paul, of which SUsbe"e was
in command off Santiago. There was a con
versation with Captain Si)?sbÂ«e through the
megaphone and he himself had used the meg
aphone in conducting the interview. The wit
ness said the Somers N. Smith was about
seventy-live or r.ne hundred feet from the St.
Paul during the conversation.
"Oive us as nearly Â»y you can the words
of that conversation," said Captain L.?m!y.
Conversation With Sig-sbee.
"We had been sent to find Commodore Schley
and the first question, of course, was 'Where
is Schley?' and the answer from Captain Sigs
bee wag "You will find him in the Yucatan
passage' and then. Inasmuch as our boat was
very slow, I asked him to advise me whether
he thought we could catch Commodore Schley
if we followed him and he stated "Yes."
"The second Question was "Where is Cer
vera?' and in answer to that Captain Sigsbee
did not speak for a moment. He consulted
with somebody on the bridge of the s-hip and
then answered 'I am not sure, but we caught
an English collier trying to sneak into the
harbor this morning. 1 That was all the con
versation I remember to have had with Cap
tain Sigsbee personally. Other men on the
boat had some conversation with him."
"Did Captain SigsbÂ«e during any time of the
conversation inform you that the Spanish
squadron was not in Santiago?"
"He did not tell us that the Spaniards were
not In there."
On cross-examination Scovil sairi that he had
been at the megaphone a part of the time.
He could not say whether others on board the
press boat had talked with Captain Sigsbee.
"Then," asked Raynor. "are you prepared to
say en your oath that no one in your boat
asked Captain Sigsbee whether Oervera was
or was not in the harbor of Santiago?"
"It Is possible." was the reply, "that a con
versation might have taken place on the part
of some one else, but as the Smith was a small
boat and as conversation must necessarily
be In a loud tone of voice I think I would
have heard it if there had been any."
"Are you then prepared to say that the tes
timony of Mr. Hare, In which he said that
Captain Sigshee had said that the Spaniards
were not at Santiago, is false?"
"No. I am not prepared to say that his
statement is false and that no such conversa
tion took place, but I can swear that nothing
of the kind was said while I was conducting
the conversation and I conducted the principal
part of It."
Correct Their Testimony.
Scovil was then excused and a number of
the witnesses of yesterday were called for
the purpose of making corrections In their tes
timony. While Captain Eaton of the Resolute
was on the stand for this purpose Captain
L<emly asked him:
"Which way was the Brooklyn heading when
you saw her funnels appear out of the smoke
to the southward as you stated yesterday?"

Bepew Speaks for Reform.
NEW YORK, Nov. I.â Senator Depew
was the principal speaker "to-night at a
fusion meeting held at Durland's Riding
Academy, this city. Other speakers were
Seth Low, candidate for Mayor, and Jus
tice Jerome, candidate for District Attor
ney. The audience packed the meeting
place and overflowed by thousands on the
adjoining streets.
The witness replied: "About southwest as
I saw her nearly broadside on."
He also ?aid that when he saw the Brooklyn
making her turn "with comparative rapidity,"
the turn had been nearly completed.
Captain Chadwick, while under recall, said
in response to a question from Raynor that
there had been a practical abrogation by the
Navy Department of the precautionary orders
concerning the bombardment of Spanish shore
batteries in order to permit the bombardment
of San Juan, Porto Rico. He added that in
Ms opinion there had been a general abrogation
of the order, but Raynor objected to the giving
of opinions.
Captain Chadwick was then excused and
Lieutenant John Hood, who commanded the
Hawk during the Spanish war, was recalled
He was questioned on the point made by Ad
miral Schley in his testimony that the com
manding officer of the Dolphin had filed with
the Navy Department a memorandum in which
he said, speaking: -of Hoods return from his
mission to Commodore Schley, while the latter
lay off Cienfuegos. "Hood says a good many
officers do not believe the Spaniards are there
(at Cienfuegos) at all. but they can only sur
mise."
In reply to a question as to what report he
had made on which thÂ» memorandum could
have been based the witness replied:
"I reported to the commanding officer of the
Dolphin that I conversed with a number of
officers and that I did not belipve myself nor
did any of the officers believe, as far as I
could make out, that the Spaniards were there
that there was no reason for believing they
were and that I thought Commodore Schley
had convinced himself they were there on very
slender grounds."
Hannaâ Did you or not make any report to
the commanding officer of the Dolphin which
would warrant the use of language embodied
in that memorandum?"
"I did make tuch a report: one warranting
stronger language than that."
Didn't Board the Adula.
Hannaâ How did you get the notes in refer
ence to hoarding the Adula?
"I never boarded the Adula. I returned to
the flagship Brooklyn after collecting the mail,
under Commodore Schley's ordÂ«rs about 11
o'clock. Just as I came aboard i' met Lieu
tenant Simpson of the Brooklyn who had
boarded the Adula and had his written report
I asked him to let me see it. as there might
be valuable information in it, which he did
I theh told him I wanted a copy of it to take
hack to the admiral as there was in my opin
ion. very valuable information in it. s'impson
and myself went to the executive officer' s office
and he read the notes over. He had the ex
ecutive officer's writer make a cony for me
to take back to the admiral as valuable In
formation. He had just come out from mak
ing his report to the commander of the flying
squadron. That as quoted in the' appendix la
an exact copy of Simpson's boarding report to
the- commander in chief of the flying squad
ron." *
Lieutenant Hood said in reply to a question
from Raynor that he had not boarded the
Adula and that the notes which he h*d car
ried back to the Dolphin were those made by
Lieutenant Simpson; hence It was Lieutenant
Simpson and not himself who had boarded the
British ship.
Lieutenant Hood was then excused and a
number of telegrams and official dispatches
which have heretofore been put in, were In
troduced at this point for the convenience of
counsel.
Captain T#mly then stated that he had one
more witness whom he desired to call on Mon
day owing to the fact that he was too ill to
appear to-day and It was also stated that
Admiral Schley would again take the stand for
the purpose of correcting his testimony
Raynor said he would have no more wit
nesses, except possibly the admiral himself
There being no further business before the
court an adjournment was taken at 12 45 until
Monday at 11 a. m. '

MURDER SUSPECT
YOUNG IS CAUGHT
Alleged Slayer of Albert
Anderson Is in
Custody.
Suecia^ Oi :natch to The Call.
MADERA. Nov. 1.-The Sheriffs office
received word 'his mornln? to arrest
Frank Young, wanted in Fresno for a
small offense. When found on the street
Young, who ju^t came from Fresno on a
bicycle, asked immediately if he was ar
rested for th* murder of Albert Ander
son in Winters. Later a message came
from the Sheriff of Solano County in
structing the local officials to hold him
on that charge.
In jail Young conversed free y about the
charge. He said he had seen a. notice of
the accusation in a paper in Fresno and
was on the way to give himself up. He
denied having had any hand in the mur
der, but said he knew who die! it and that
more than one were implicated. Ander
son, declared the suspect, was on too in
timate relations with a woman and Young
indirectly but clearly accused the wo
man's father of having killed Anderson.
He would not mention names, hut said he
would tell all on his arrival in Winters
and it would cause a great sensation.
Young said he knew nothing about the
bloody shirt that was found near the
cabin he had occupied. Anderson had
had a fight shortly beforÂ° the murder

Young asserted that Anderson was in the
habit of wearing his (Young's) clothing
as they were great friends. He expressed
impatience for the arrival of Sheriff Sav

CABINET LOOKS
OVER THE LIST
Considers Appointments
President Will Send
to Congress.
\TiLSHTXGTOX, Nov. I.â The Cabinet
meeting to-day was devoted largely to the
consideration of the President's appoint
ments which the President will send to
Congress when it convenes next month.
The President is going carefully over
;liesÂ« appointments with the members of
abinet. Secretary Gage reported his
action, in resuming the purchase of bonds,
wbtc i was responded to to-day with an
offer of over $900,000. JCo announcement
Â«ef made as to the length of time the
-.ase is to continue.
The Cabinet also discussed the abroga-
C f the so-called Browning Indian
school ruling, but no further action was
taken. Secretary Hitchcock explained the
situation, and says that if abrogation
â¢ s to be a disadvantage to the In
dian children or detrimental to their best
ir.teri?sts he would recall it and re-estab
lish the Browning ruling, which was
made on September 30. 1896, and directed
that Indian agents first should build up
and maintain the Government day schools
faiid declared that Indian parents have no
right to designate which school their chil
dren shall attend.
In a public cape, however, according to
uling, where the agents think it ad
le to follow the wishes of the pa
e, that is left entirely to their own
A judgment.
The abrogation of the ruling already
has caused numerous Inquiries of the In
terior Department. The Bureau of Cath
olic Missions has been fighting for the
abrogation ever since the ruling was
made and last July calied attention of
epartment to its non-action and to
ract that Secretary Hitchcock, when
dflc Coast trip of the President
and Cabinet last summer, had telegraphed
Secretary Ryan to give Arch
p Riordan assurance that the ruling
rescinded and that Ryan wired
â¢ rchblshop accordingly. Commission
er of Indian Affairs Jones has strenuously
eied the abrogation, but finally, after
-Hussion with Secretary Hitch

BOERS WIN BIG BATTLE NEAR BETHEL,
KILLING THREE SCORE BRITISH TROOPS
Thousand Republican Troops Attack the Rear Guard of Benson's Column
During a Mist, Capture Two Guns, Kill Sixty-Three Officers and Men
and Seriously Wound One Hundred and Sixty of the Soldiers
LONDON, Nov. 2. â Lord Kitchener has reported to the War Office a disaster to the
British near Bethel, Eastern Transvaal, in which two guns were lost, several officers
killed or wounded, and -fifty-four men were killed and 160 wounded.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â Following
is the text of Lord Kitchener's
dispatch, dated Pretoria. Nov.
i: "I have just heard of a se
vere attack made on the rear guard of
Colonel Benson's column, when about
twenty miles northwest of Bethel, near
Broken Laagte, during a thick mist.
"The strength of the enemy is re
ported to have been a thousand. They
rushed two guns with the rear guard,
but it is uncertain whether they were
able to remove them.
"I fear our casualties were heavy.
Colonel Benson was wounded, but not
seriously. A relieving column will
reach him this morning."
Later Lord Kitchener telegraphed as
follows:
"Colonel Barton, who marched from
the constabulary line yesterday, reached
Benson's column early this morning
(Friday) unopposed. He reports that
Colonel Benson died from his wounds.
KILLED AND WOUNDED.
"The casualties are as follows:
"Killed: '

DEFEAT DEATH
IN THEIR RACE
Eight Children Are Taken
From Colorado to
Chicago.
CHICAGO. Nov. I.â Eight children, ac
companied by their parents, ended a 1500
mile race for life this evening at the Chi
cago Pasteur Institute. Another child
will arrive to-morrow.
The youngsters, ranging in- age from
four to nine years, came from Colorado
Springs, Colo., where they were bitten
last Sunday by a dog afflicted with rab
ies. Fearirvg hydrophobia, their parents
began the long journey to have their chil
dren treated.
The victims were met at the institute
by Dr. A. I^ogorie, who administered the
first injection of serum. To insure suc
cess Dr. Logorie prefers to administer the
first treatment within five days of the
time the bite was inflicted. If the chil
dren had not arrived to-day, he says, rab
ies probably would have developed and
death might have resulted.
Dr. Log-orle said to-night that the chil
dren would recover. His patients are:
Charles Gregory, Catherine Lamb, Nellie.
Chester and Margaret McAullffe; Hazel
and Agnes Vanderventer, and Hazel
Meech. The victims are the chuuren of
mechanics employed in Colorado Springs.
The animal which caused the trouble was
a little black and tan dog owned by Mrs.
McAuliffe.
Stanford Memorial Choir.
STANFORD "UNIVERSITY, Nov. I.â
Arthur L. Scott-Brook has been appoint
ed organist in the Stanford Memorial
Church by Mrs. Stanford. The appoint
ment was made yesterday and Organist
Brook will enter on his duties at once.
Mr. Brook will organize and train a large
choir besides performing his duties as or
ganist. With this idea in view he has
begun to interest vocal talent at the uni
versity in the movement and expects to
have a thoroughly trained choir by MaVch
9, in accordance with Mrs. Stanford's
wishes, in .order that it may take a lead
ing part in the services at the dedication
of the Memorial Church on that date.
After the formal dedication on March 9,
religious services will be held every after
noon, the hour varying according to the
season of the year.
Marietta Ordered to Colon.
.Â¦WASHINGTON, Nov. I.â The Navy De

for some months past.

of thirteen other officers who were
wounded, most of them seriously, and
then announces that fifty-four non
commissioned officers and men were
killed and 160 wounded, adding that
four of the latter have since died of their
wounds. The dispatch then says:
"I assume that the two guns have
been recovered and the enemy has
withdrawn, but I have no further de
tail.
"I deeply regret the loss of Colonel
Benson and the other officers and men
who fell with him. In Benson the ser
vice loses a most gallant and capable
officer, who invariably led his column
with marked success and judgment.
FIGHT AT CLOSE QUARTERS.
"The fighting was at close quarters
and maintained with determination by
both sides. The enemy suffered heav
ily, but I have not yet received a re
liable estimate.
"The Boers retired east"
Colonel Benson had been for some
time operating in the vicinity of
Bethel, which is northeast of Stan
derton. He surprised a Boer laa
ger October 22, near Trichards
fontein, taking thirty-seven prison
ers. Three days later, according to
Lord Kitchener's report at the time,
after a long night march, the com
mandos under Grobelaar and Erasmus
heavily attacked Benson's rear guard
flanks at Yzirvarkfontein, but were eas
ily driven away."

HAIGHT PROUD
OF HIS MUSCLE
Clubman Makes Dumb
bells Out of Wife
and Friends.
Because Harry H. Haight. a prominent
young clubman, possesses muscles of Iron
and has a desire to display his strength
upon the least provocation. He ex
ercised his mighty sinews by mak
ing human dumbbells of his wife and
her lady friends and, though the exercise
may have afforded him a great deal of
amusement, Mrs. Haight got nothing out
of it but bruises and broken bones. She
sued him for divorce on the ground of
cruelty and yesterday Judge Kerrigan
granted her a decree. In addition to los
ing his wife, Haight must pay her $75 a
month for twp Â¦ years, dating from Sep
tember 1 of this year. Mrs. Haight also
gets the household goods in the residence
at 2000 Steiner street, while the muscular
clubman retains possession of the furni
ture and household goods in the residence
at 1921 Broadway.
The Halghts did not appear In court
yesterday. The decree was granted by
Judge Kerrigan after reading about twen
ty pages of evidence taken by Court Com
missioner Thomas Mulvey, who was or
dered by the court to take the testimony
of Mrs. Haight and her friends.
In Mrs. Haight's deposition she states
that she was married to Harry Haight
at Oakland in November, 1893. She said
her husband always used intoxicating li
quors, but that after the marriage he
seemed to indulge in them to a greater
extent. She also said her husband was
very proud of his strength, and that when
he had indulged to any extent he showed
an anxiety to display his powers as a
man of brawn.
On New Year's eve, 1895, Mrs. Haight
testified, her husband came to their home
in Oakland under the influence of liquor.
He had telephoned from this city that he
was doing the "cocktail route" with tho
boys and that he would not be home, but
evidently changed his mind, as he ar
rived at his home about 1 a. m. Mrs.
Haight says she remonstrated with him
for appearing in such a condition, where
upon he "picked her up and threw her a
distance of ten feet against the side of
the house. The injuries she received
through this treatment, Mrs. Haight
stated, made her lame and sore for a
number of days.
Haighfs most wonderful feat, however,
in tossing human beings' about occurred
at a restaurant in this city on the night
of April 6, 1901.
From Mrs. Haight's deposition it la
learned that on this occasion she and her
husband were invited to join Harry Vee
der, B. G. Somers, Miss Dora Benson and
a Mrs. Gibbon at a dinner at the restau
rant. On the afternoon of the 6th Mrs.
Haight telephoned to her husband that
Mr. Veeder had asked her to come to the
restaurant a little early, in order that she
might oversee the decorating of the room
in which the party was to dine. Haight
gave his permission, according to Mrs.
Haight, and informed her that he would
bring Miss Benson.
When the time for the arrival of Miss
Benson and Haight came and the couple
had not put in an appearnce Mrs. Haight
grew anxious and telephoned to Miss
Benson's home. She was informed that
Miss Benson had left the house an hour
before. A half-hour later, as the young
lady had not arrived, Mrs. Haight tele
phoned again and was surprised to hear
that Miss Benson had returned home and
had retired. Explanations followed and
Miss Benson confessed that she was dis
gusted with Haight'g conduct, he having
telephoned her that he would meet her In
five minutes. A coupe was sent for Miss
Benson and the party prepared to enjoy
their dinner. Haight came in with the
second course, deposes Mrs. Haight,
very much under the influence of liquor
and very angry. He Inquired for Miss
Benson, and on being told that her where
abouts was not known commenced his
muscular stunts. He first seized Mrs.
Gibbon and thtew her into the air and
then held* her out at arm's length. Mrs.
R.\ight remonstrated, she claims, and
found herself in a heap in a corner of tho
room. Her husband helped her to her
feet, and in doing so grasped her hands so
brutally that he broke one finger and dis
located two others of her left hand.
Haight then threw a plate of mayonaise
dressing at his wife and finished his ex
hibition by breaking champagne bottles
and throwing all the glasses in the room
against the walls. The fact that "music
hath charms to soothe the savage breast"
saved ttie rest of the furniture and Mrs
Haigbfs bones. An orchestra in the hall
started and the muscular clubman was
attracted to the spot, and in his absence
the party left the building.
HaJsrht evidently went directly home to
1921 Broadway, for when his wife reachel
the house they found him in bed. Somers
was compelled to enter the house through
a second-story window, deposes Mrs.
Haight, as every door was locked and sho
could not get in until Somers had opened
the door.
In the decree nf divorce granted by
Judge Kerrigan an agreement signed by
Haight and his wife was incorporated
whereby it was stipulated that the costs
of suit incurred should be paid by both
parties.
suited so disastrously, or whether the
Boers who had been repulsed took ad
vantage of the mist to reattack. is un
explained. Lord Kitchener does not
give the date of the Bethel engagement.
SMALL BRITISH STTCCESS.
Colonel Kekewich Captures Seventy-
Bight Boers.
LONDON, Nov. 1. â A dispatch from
Lord Kitchener, dated Pretoria, received
here to-day, says Colonel Kekewich, dur
ing a night surprise of Van Albert's
laager, northeast of Rustenberg, about
sixty miles west of Pretoria, captured
seventy-eight Boers.
A dispatch to the News Agency from
Portsmouth says a mad Dutchman has
been arrested for trying to enter Ports
mouth Yard, saying he had come from
Canada to Induce the King to stop the
war in South Africa.
AMSTERDAM, Nov. I.â The Boer dep
utation here summoned Leyds and Van
Boescholen by telegraph yesterday from
Brussels to consider dispatches received
from the Boer leaders in the field, saying
that the fighting burghers were deter
mined to match reprisals if the British
continue hanging and shootin? rebels and
others, to the effect that the Boer au
thorities in South Africa affirm that the
adoption of reprisals would be bad policy,
and that, in order to strengthen their po
sition, they require Mr. Kruger to let
them know his position, as he still has the
greatest hold on the minds of the burgh
ers. The meeting lasted four hours, and
it was decided to advise Mr. Kruger to
comply with the request of the Boer au
thorities and to take the opportunity to
bring the subject of British executions in
South Africa before the European public
in an open letter.
Dr. Leyds has gone to Heilversum to
present the matter to Mr. Kruger.

military academy in Chester, Pennsyl
vania. With his widowed mother and an
aunt he came to California in 1886 and
lived for four years in San Diego County.
He was a civil engineer and was always
interested in the promotion of good roads
projects. Governor Budd appointed him
State Highway Commissioner and on his
reappointment by Governor Gage he
served till last March. He traveled over

PLAIN TALK
To Catarrh Sufferers.
Every person suffering from catarrh in
its many forms knows that the common
lotions, salves and douches do not cure. It
is needless to argue this point or to cite
cases of failure, because every victim of
catarrhal trouble knows it for himself If
he has tried them.
A local application, If it does anything
at all, simply gives temporary relief- a
wash, lotion, salve or powder cannot
reach the seat of the disease, which is
the blood.
The mucous membrane seeks to relieve
the blood of catarrhal poison by secreting
large quantities of mucus, the discharge
sometimes closing up the nostrils, de-
scending to the throat and larynx, caus-
ing an irritating cough, continual clearing
of the throat, deafness, indigestion and
many other disagreeable and persistent
symptoms.
A remedy to reaJly euro catarrh must
be an internal treatment; a remedy which
will gradually cleanse the system fi\>m
catarrhal poison and remove the fever and
congestion always present in the mucous
membrane.
The best remedies for this purpoc* are
Eucalyptol Sangulnaria and Hydrastin,
but the difficulty has always been to get
these valuable curatives combined in one
palatable, convenient and efficient form
Recently this has been accomplished
and the preparation put on the market
under the name of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets; they are large, pleasant tasting
lozengts, so that they may be slowly dis-
solved In the mouth, thus reaching every
part of the mucous membrane and finally
the stomach and intestines.
An advantage to be considered also is
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain no
cocoaine, morphine or poisonous narcotics
so often found in catarrh powders, and
the use of which often entailo a habit
more dangerous than the disease.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by
druggists at 50 cents for full-sized pack-
age and are probably the safest and most
effectual catarrh cure on the market.

YAQUI AMBITION.
THE renewal of war against Mexico by the In
dians of the Yatjui Valley is unexpected and
found the Government unprepared. The Fed
crai troops had withdrawn from Sonora and the
Yaqui war was supposed to be over. Only the prompt
arance and brave conduct of Colonel Quintiro
and his small force of local troops saved Guaymas
from capture in the first action of the renewed war.
The Yaquis number many thousands. They have
never surrendered their rich valley to Mexico, and
are now resisting the desire of the Government to
remote them to the southern part of the republic and
take possession of their country. They are not a
savage people, but have issued from primitive con
ditions and are an industrial community, with intense
tribai patriotism and capable of great courage and
strategy in war.
Before renewing the military struggle they organ
ized a junta and issued a proclamation, which is an
interesting thing in its way. It declares that "the
tendency of civilization is to make nations
of continents, since it is as easy to govern a continent
in these days as a county one hundred years ago.
Hence it is unjust that the people of North America
should support three Governments when one is suffi
cient. Two of the three Governments of North
America exist under false pretenses. Their consti
tutions, modeled after that of the United States, are
mockeries used as cloaks to cover their tyranny.
They support themselves by oppressing the weak and
submissive, by destroying the brave and unyielding,
and by living on the charity of the great republic
from which they draw their revenues. It is the duty
of the United States tc see that these mendicant and
criminal Governments cease to exist, since they have
proven that they do not deserve to exist, and it is the
purpose of the Yaqui people to assist the United
States in that duty. The Yaquis seek the destruction
of the Mexican Government not only to avenge the
expulsion of the Yaqui women and to prevent the
extermination of the Yaqui race, but for the benefit
of the entire continent."
After setting forth their purpose to annex Mexico
to the United State?, this remarkable document takes
a political turn of another character, to this effect:
"Only after the annexation of Mexico to the United
States will the control of the commerce of the silver
using populations by the silver-producing continent
be possible. Therefore the annexation of Mexico will
bring about the triumphant free coinage of silver as
well as the control of Panama by the United States,
thus placing in the hands of the North American
people the commerce of the world. In return for the
universal liberation that the Yaqui revolution inaugu
rates all the Yaquis expect is participation in the en
suing civilization, and, recognizing the permanent
independence of Sonora as useless, they have com
bined with their watch cry, 'Yaquis must survive,'
the motto, 'The continent one nation.' " This mani
festo is signed by Romualdo Tenebanto, Evaristo
Gutmasolco, Adriasola Cupo, Benito Gutierrez, Ale
jandro Piumoblanco, and, of course, by John Dwyer!
So, while the world rings with the noise of big
politics, these isolated people emerge upon the stage
. a programme to change the political map of the
hemisphere. What an opportunity it offers for fili
bustering from this country, provided the filibuster
spirit is still abroad among our people. The situation
is not unlike that presented by Texas from 1820 un
til 1836 and the battle of San Jacinto, and if there
were Houstons, Crocketts and Bowies here to take
advantage of it much history might be made in the
Yaqui Valley. The ambitious scheme will not prob
secure much sympathy in Mexico outside the
Yaqui country. The Aztec blood is diffused through
out the republic, and since the time of Juarez, who
was a pure Aztec, that people has been contented
the republic as it is. If, however, at any time
before the power of the Yaquis is broken there should
occur such internecine political complications as may
arise with the passing of the era of Diaz., and the
Aztecs and Yaquis get together, this plan, formed
by a junta of obscure Indians and John Dwyer, might
b* heard from again.
KTO"W, I/TJR,. "WELLS !
IN your speech at Teutonia Hall, Mr. Wells, on Thursday night, you said: "Now,
my friends, I don't know as there is any great question you want to hear from,
from me. All of the issues have been talked over, and while they have not been
talked over as they have been referred to in the papers, I can see nothing that re
quires any great discussion and that you care for."
Really now, Mr. Wells, do you believe that? Do you really* believe that the
people take so little interest in their local government ' that all they care is to
hear you say that you were born, that you were in business in one place thirty-five
years, that you tipple some and keep the finest liquors in your house, and that you
used to live in a big house you own up the avenue, and that some parts of the town are
not as near each other as some other parts?
When you spoke on Thursday night the people expected you to tell why you
support the Supervisor ticket that runs with you, and why you stayed on the ticket
after saying that you would get off and permanently retire from public life if Flint were
not made a Supervisor? There are other issues upon which the people want to hear you,
but those are issues you made yourself. You made them and abandoned them, and the
people want to know why. There is a suspicion that the influence that changed your
position is one that they do not wish to put in control of the city by your election. If
that influence could induce you to surrender what you highly call your "rights," the
people fear it can also induce you to surrender their rights. Do you see it, Mr. Wells?
By way of answer to this question which the people ask, in your speech on Thurs
day night you said: "I can say to you that all I have ever done for myself I have done
in this vicinity." Do you think that is an answer? Has any one said that you did not
do for yourself in that vicinity? Has any one accused you of doing something in any
other vicinity? Have you been accused of not doing anything for yourself in that vicin
ity? Why do you acid a "vicinity," as an issue to your tipple, your O. P. S.at home, your
large bouse up the avenue, and the distance of one end of the city from the other
end, as if anybody had required you to prove that the two ends of the city are 'not tCK
gether, like the nose and tail of a sleeping pussy cat?
The unanswered questions of the people still haunted you on Thursday night, and
while they were ringing in your ears you said: "I can say further to you, my friends,
there is none of you but what is just as likely, whose prospects are just as good of your
being wealthy and being Mayor of this city, as I was when I was of your age."
Why do you make such an assault on the English language and call it an answer?
Why stir up such a riot and knockdown between the innocent parts of speech, and set
the hand of adverb against adverb, and put nouns and pronouns, heretofore of good
reputation, in places where they don't belong, and call it an answer?
How do you know but you were speaking to some man who wants to be Mayor?
Why cut down the verdure of his ambition with a killing frost by telling him his chance
is as good as yours, when yours is not good at all?
In a second speech the same evening the unanswered interrogation point hung
over your head and you said, "My friends, I don't think I should talk any longer this
evening." Really, Mr. Wells, you might have taken five minutes in which to answer
about the Supervisors and Flint. You might have told what wonder-worker it was who
took the Supervisor ticket when its sins were as scarlet in your eyes and washed it
whiter than snow.
Before your stump campaign ends won't you speak .in some "vicinity" where
you didn't do business, and where you don't own a large house up the avenue, and that
is not far from the other end of the city, where all these issues of time, space and local
ity will be out of mind, and then answer the questions the people ask and tell them what
they want to hear?
THE SCHMITZ VOTE.
POLITICIANS are figuring anxiously as to
whether the Schmitz vote on election day will
draw more largely from the Republican or
from the Democratic party. At the beginning of the
campaign it was conceded on all sides that the votes
of union workingmen would be divided, that Schmitz
would receive a portion and that Wells and Tobin
would each receive a part. The Schmitz managers
now claim that their strength has increased among
the unionist, vote, but they are not able to point to
any recruits from outside of the union ranks.
When Schmitz began his canvass his forces were
divided about equally between Democrats and Re
publicans. The Tobin managers have made a deter
mined and aggressive fight in the Schmitz districts to
bring the Democratic forces of Schmitz back to their
party standard and have met with very considerable
success. On the contrary, the Republican managers,
through incompetent leadership and other causes,
made absolutely no effort to win back those Repub
licans who had joined the Schmitz party. The result
is that at this time the Schmitz forces are at least
two-thirds Republican. This being the case, if any
considerable number of Republicans should vote for
Tobin there cannot be the faintest doubt that he will
have an overwhelming majority on election day.
Whatever else be doubtful as to the outlook, it
must be conceded that Tobin and Wetls are not run
ning neck and neck. -Either one is' bound to get the
wavering vote that is opposed to Schmitz. Which
ever one of the two receives this wavering vote is
bound to lead the other by a very large majority.
Tobin has made the most aggressive fight. He has
addressed six times as many meetings as Wells and
has been most enthusiastically received at all of them.
He has conducted an active personal canvass in the
daytime for the last three weeks, meeting personally
at least two thousand people each day, and addressing
more than that number every night. Wells, on the
contrary, began his canvass in the districts just one
week ago. He has addressed but one-sixth of the
number of public meetings that Tobin has, and they
have not been as well attended. He has made no
personal canvass of voters in the daytime. The re
sult is that the wavering voters arc beginning to see
that Tobin is largely in the lead over Wells, and for
that reason alone in their anxiety to beat Schmitz
they are flocking to Tobin's standard.
Our Eastern friends are now excited over the an
nouncement from London that there will soon visit
New York a "mysterious oriental Prince," whose
proper title and dwelling-place are unknown, but
who has money to burn and style enough to make the
burning glow like a bonfire. He entered London un
announced, engaged twenty-three rooms in one of
the finest hotels in the city, brought with him a splen
did retinue, including musicians and dancing girls,
lived in ostentatious seclusion, and departed as he
came, leaving nothing behind him except a report
that he is headed for America.
One of the features of the municipal campaign
in New York is the publication of a circular letter is
sued to the Tammany office-holders asking for con
tributions to the campaign fund and saying: "We as
sure you that every dollar that comes into our hands
will be honestly and economically expended. Checks
can be made payable to Richard Croker, chairman of
the finance committee." The honesty and economy
with which Croker handles money is well understood.
It was by the practice of such virtues that he became
so rich he can keep a racing stable in England and
his son can pay $1000 for a bull pup.
From the vehemence with which both Turkey and
Bulgaria deny any responsibility for the kidnaping
of Miss Stone it seems there must be a very exten
sive bit of neutral territory between the two countries
in that particular neck of the woods.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER. 2, 1901.
IF SCHMITZ SHOULD BE ELECTED
MAYOR.
SUPPOSE that by a temporary loss of reason the
good people of this city should elect Schmitz
Mayor, who would be appointed Chief of Po
lice? Who would be appointed Police Commission
ers? Would these officials be appointed from his own
camp exclusively, just as the Labor Union ticket is
composed of labor union men exclusively. 1 * It is rea
sonable to suppose that such would be his policy.
What, then, if Michael Casey, the walking delegate of
the Teamsters' Union, should be appointed Chief of
Police, and Andrew Furuseth and his associates to
the Police Commission? Do our law-abiding citizens
contemplate this possibility with equanimity?
DR. ERNEST HASSE, a German economist,
noted for his study of cities, has, for the pur
pose of establishing the true limits of urban
populations, laid down a rule which will doubtless be
generally adopted by economic writers. He notes
that it is useless to rely upon corporation lines as the
boundaries of cities when their populations are under
consideration, for in many communities the popula
tion has spread out beyond those lines, and the
dwellers in the outlying districts are really living'un
der urban conditions as much as those within the city
limits.
. For the purpose of establishing a genuine division
between the urban and the non-urban residents of a
given community Dr. Hasse begins with the center
of population and around that area draws concentric
circles of varying diameters. He continues to in
scribe one area after another in these rings until he
reaches a ring in which the average density of popu
lation falls to the ievel of that of the province in
which the city is situated. The application of his
method to the city of Vienna is given as an illustra
tion of its working. Around the center of that city
the doctor inscribed a circle one kilometer in diame
ter; then another circle a kilometer distant from the
first, and so on until within the fifteenth kilometric
ring he found a population whose density was only
fifty-nine persons to the square kilometer. That den
sity is about the same as that of the whole province
of Lower Austria in which Vienna is situated, and
according to the Hasse rule all persons living within
the first fourteen circles are urban, while those in the
fifteenth and beyond it are rural.
Should that rule be applied here San Francisco's
population would include all of Oakland and
Berkeley and Alameda. We are thus entitled to a
much larger metropolitan rank than we now hold.
Many other cities in the United States are similarly
situated, for it is not always that corporation lines
include all the urban population of the community.
After an inspection of 33,000 designs the Australian
Government has selected a flag for the frew nation.
It has a red field with the union jack displayed in the
upper left-hand corner, a big six-pointed star to rep
resent Australia and her six provinces, and, finally, a
number of other stars to represent the southern cross.
It is a dandy flag.
An intimate friend of the President writes to the
Philadelphia Record that the correct pronunciation of
the President's name can be determined by the rhym
ing of these lines: "The office-seeker was in pain;
no tongue can tell the woes he felt when told he need
not call again to worry Mister Rose-e-velt."
Bryan manages to get his name in the papers once
in a while, and his latest notice has been due to the
fact that he bought a short-horned heifer for $450;
consequently the next outburst of bleating from the
Bryan farm may be due not to the Colonel himself
but to some other calf.

DUDLEY DUBOSE AND PILLSBURY'S
BROWN HAT DIVIDE DAY'S HONORS
SCENE IN COURT. WHILE DUDLEY EUBOSE, FRESH FROM LUXURIOUS QUARTERS IN THE ALAMEDA
COUNTY JAIL, WAS TELLING OF THE VALUE OF THE TESTIMONY THAT THE OLD BROWN HAT OF E.
8. PILLSBURY FREQUENTLY CONTAINED.
A STIFF brown hat and a prisoner
furnished the amusement and life
in the Nome contempt proceed
ings yesterday before Judge jrlea
cock. The hat belongs to E. S.
Pillsbury, amicus curiae, and the prisoner
is Dudley Dubose. Judging from the
amount of testimony the hat has con
tained it ought to be introduced in evi
dence. Dubose was introduced.
Fresh from a lunch of seven courses
and three ices served by Oakland's pre
mier chief, Dudley Dubose left the Ala
meda County Jail to go upon the stand
in behalf of the respondent's side of the
case. AVheji he arrived the attorneys
joked about taking him away from his
home and hoped he suffered no incon
venience. Dubcse smiled in a wan sort
of way, informing the jesters that he was
only too ready to leave his pleasant home
at any time.
The trip was hardly worth the takingâ
to anybody save Dubose, who enjoyed the
ride on the bay and the mild excitement
that prevailed in the courtroom. The re
spondent's attorneys painfully went
through certain portions of Hume's tes
timony, in which Dubose and certain con
versations between various parties were
mentioned. Dubose's testimony in sev
eral instances runs counter to Hume's
statement.
If Dubose was not worked hard Pills
bury's hat was. Trie amicus curiae sits
in the jury box with his hat on an ad
joining chair. Behind him sit Samuel
Knight and "Billy" Metson, the terror
of Nome gun lighters. They have had
Nome affairs to eat, drink and sleep on
for the last year and are full of sugges
tions to the cross-examiner. In order not
to disturb the court they write out the
Hitting idea and pass it into the hat.
Eighty-three inscribed and hatted ideas
have so far gone into the record. When
Pillsbury runs out of Questions the hat
comes into the case.
The attorneys have begun to war in
earnest. Bellicose attitudes, sharp
words and thundering voices are consid
ered very proper. The sarcasm consumes
itself, however, for the amicus curiae will
not mix in and the respondents' attor
neys quit with "some secret satisfaction"
after the witness has answered the ir
relevant, incompetent, immaterial and
otherwise objectionable question.
At the opening of the morning session
Mr. Pillsbury continued his cross-examin
ation of Witness C. A. S. Frost. Hia
questions were directed to Frost's actions
r.nd knowledge of events on the day that
McKenzie was arrested. The "whole
story of the forceful possession was
threshed over. Pillsbury tried to break
down the witness' statements about his

innocence in connection with the resist
ance of the execution of the writs. Frost
took refuge behind an occasional lapse
of memory, but more generally denied all
charges that he advised any one to re
sist the writs.
The next line of questions was directed
toward the intimacy of Judge Noyes and
the witness. The amicus curiae said the
band of Judge Noyes was to be found
in all the positions Frost assumed while
in Nome and his cross-examination was
directed toward to establishing this fact.
Not long after this the amicus curiae
provoked a tempest:
"Did McKenzie ever lend you any
money?" was the question that caused
the disturbance. MaLaughlin said bitter
things to Pillsbury and Heney jumped
into the argument before the witness
answered:
"Tes, sir; $200 somewhere along October
1, 1900. I needed the money for living
expenses. I sent for my wife and was
out of funds."
Pillsbury then tried to force the wit
ress to explain why he went to McKenzie
and not to others. The witness bristled
and told Pillsbury that he might even
ask him for a loan of $10 if they were
acquainted.
"Possibly," gaid Judge McLaughlin.
Then the amicus curiae went back to
the bank, the writs of supersedeas and
that October day when McKenzie was ar
rested. Frost replied that he did not
talk with Judge Noyes or District Attor

LA GIBONDE UNSALVED.
Samoa Returns From San Nicholas
Island Without the Schooner.
The steam schooner Samoa came back
to port last Thursday nigrht without the
schooner La Giror.de. She v.-as supposed
to have towed that vessel oft San Nicho
las Island, but the men in possession
would not allow the captain of the steam
er to put a line aboard.
The La Gironde was on her way to San
Francisco, when a dense fog came down
and she ran on San Nicholas Island. The
crew refused to remain by the vessel and
forced the captain and mate to go with
them to San Pedro. At the latter port
the captain chartered the steam schooner
Acme to go back to the wreck, but on his
arrival found a crew of salvers in charge.
They refused to give up possession, so
the Acme came to San Francisco. Then
the Samoa was sent frem here to make
terms with the men in possession, but the
latter would not treat on any terms, and
when the captain of the steam schooner
attempted to put a line aboard they pro
duced shotguns and threatened to kill the
first man who put foot on the L.a Gironde.
The matter will now have to be taken
into the courts for settlement and in the
meantime the schooner will probably go
to pieces in the first gale.
Murderer Brought Back.
The whaling bark California arrived
yesterday from Okhotsk Sea. 41 days out.
The run was prolonged owing to strong
head winds. William Stewart, the ships
Book, was brought home in Irons. For
nearly five months he has been in con
finement, but he does not show any signs
of his imprisonment. On June 6 last Stew
art ar.d a "green hand" named Otto
Schroeder got into a quarr&l. Schroeder
was getting the better of the fight, when
Stewart drew a knife and stabbed him to
death. The deceased was on his first
cruise, while Stewart had made a voyage
on a coaster. Both were young men and
previously had been friends. Schroeder is
said to have wealthy relatives in San
Francisco, while Stewart's people are all
in Los Angeles.
Soon after the murder the California
ran into a school of whales and all the
boats were lowered. One of them was
emesbed into kindling wood by a levia
'he-.n and William Faulkner was killed.
Only one whale was taken and the cap
tain decided that the murderer aboard
was-; a hoodoo, so he put into Hakodate
and tried to turn Stewart over to the
L'rited State* Consul. The latter would
not take him. however, so the bark had
to pail again with the hoodoo aboard. All
she brought into port was 1050 barrels of
pcrm and 50 barrels of whale oil and 000
pounds of whalebone.
Water-Front Notes.
The shipping of the port has been the
heavippt of any month during this year.
Iho foreign departures for October ag

Th< foreign arrivals aggregated

turn of the Santa Clara to San Francisco
the cannery fleet will be accounted for

ARMY TRANSPORT KILPATRICK SAILS
FOR THE PHILIPPINES WITH TROOPS
SAILING OF THE ARMY TRANSPORT KILPATRICK ON WHAT WILL PROBABLY BE HER LAST VOYAGE
FROM THIS PORT. FROM MANILA SHE WILL. GO TO NEW YORK AND AFTER THAT MAY BE SOLD
FOR A MERCHANT STEAMER. '
THE United States army transport
Kilpatrick sailed for the Philip
pines yesterday. The probabilities
are that she will not be seen again
in this port for a long time, as
Uncle Sam intends recalling her to New
York. It is the policy of the administra
tion to retire all the single screw trans
ports as quickly as possible and keep
nothing in service â¢ but the best of the
fleet. A single screw vessel is likely at
any time to break down completely, while
a twin-screw steamship has. always two
chances to one.
The Kilpatrick took away yesterday
thirty-nine cabin passengers and about 160
recruits, four members of the hospital
corps and four nurses. Those who went
away in the cabin were:
Captain George P. Ahem and wife, Captain
S. T. Weirick, Lieutenant W. A. Carlion and
wife. Lieutenant AVilliam G. Fleischhauer, Sec
ond Lieutenants Fred Burg, F. W. Bugbee and

Before the vessel pulled out into the
stream o.uite a crowd of young people
invaded the wharf. They were down to
bid adieu to Mrs. Lawton, who goes to
the Philippines as a brida. Rice and old
shces followed the transport in a shower
as she pulled away from the pier.
The Kilpatrick was in splendid condi
tion going- to sea, owing to* the efforts of
Chief Steward Herbert of the Grant, who
attended to her fitting out. At the last
moment Chief Steward J. J. Fallon, late
of the St. Paul, was appointed to the ves
sel and went out on her. Fallon's many
friends will be glad to learn that he is
still in the land of the living, as last win

McCLURES
FOB NOVEMBER
Contains fifteen superbly illustrated articles, stories and poems,
among which appear a thrilling account of the Fastest Race Ever
Run (the great automobile race from Paris to Berlin); a powerful
story of ward politics; an autnoritative study of the mammoth
steel corporation that is thoroughly interesting, and a heart
warming story of Thanksgiving time. The most timely article is:
ROOSEVELT
By WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE.
A masterly presentation of the man's character, written with
frank, absolute sincerity and with an acumen and insight that no
one else,
THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED FROM PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCESHIP,
has ever brought to bear upon the personality of Theodore Roose-
velt. It makes clear just what kind of a President such a man is
bound to make. There is no other writer devoting himself to this
special branch of literature â the character study â who has the en-
dowment, the literary art of expression that William Allen White
has. It is a rare and great achievement to make a real man as typ-
ical as a great character in a novel. It is an article from which
historians of the future will be able to get at the real man.

WASHINGTON, Nov. I.â ln seeking to
obtain recognition of its right to a settle
ment at Tientsin the United States is
checkmating a plan of the German of
ficials at that point to secure possession
of the land hitherto held by this Govern
ment. In connection with the negotia
tions now in progress regarding the
American settlement it was learned to
day that the Germans at Tientsin have
been endeavoring to extend the bounda
ries of their concession so as to include
land which some years ago "was placed
under American jurisdiction. The UniteÂ«J
States failed to maintain the settlement
and it has been administered as a part of
the British settlement.
The British are not disposed to prevent
the Germans from taking possession, and
in order to insure its preservation for
American settlement Minister Conger, un
der instructions from Secretary Hay, has
sought to have the boundaries again of
ficially defined. The latest advices re
ceived from Poking show that there will
be no difficulty in obtaining compliance
with the wishes expressed by Conger.

MANIFESTO OF MASSO
EXCITES THE CUBANS
New Candidate for the Presidency
Ceuses Great Stir in Political
Circles.
HAVANA, Nov. I.â The manifesto of
General Bartolomo Masso in declaring
himself a candidate for the Presidency of
Cuba has caused a stir in political circles,
it is generally admitted that he will prove
a strong candidate if he receives the sup
port of the Autonomist party. El Diarlo
de la Marina, the organ of the Autono
mists, commends the manifesto.
"It is not the redhot bombshell predict
ed " says the paper, "but a conservative
and well-ordered pronouncement. The
idea of evolving gradually into independ
ence under the Platt amendment is the
view the Autonomists take. General Mas
so's plea that the payment of the army
should be the first obligation of the re
public is a political move and has no
alarming significance, especially when we
take into consideration the conservatism
that is evident throughout the manfesto."
La Discussion ridicules General Masso's
candidacy and criticizes his bid for the
Autonomist and negro vote.
La Lucha, sounding a note of warning
for the men surrounding Senor Palma,
says:
"Unless something is done immediately
to unite the Cubans, the fierce political
struggle that is inevitable with General
Masso in the field will result in a disturb
ance of the moral peace of the island.
The official element backing Senor Palma
lacks tact, prudence and has no other ob
ject than to hold on to the present office.''

NELSON'S SKIP
ROARS WELCOME
Famous Old Victory Be
gins Salute to Ed
ward's Son.
PORTSMOUTH, Eng., Nov. I.â To-day's
naval pageant in honor of the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York was al
most a reproduction of the ceremonial at
tending their departure.
The town and harbor were astir early.
Immense crowds assembled along the sea
front and rounds of cheers mingled with
the national anthem and salutes from the
harbor ships and land batteries as the
royal yacht Victoria and Albert steamed
to meet the Ophir. On board the royal
yacht the King in the undress uniform of
an admiral stood on the after bridge at
the salute, while the Queen and the chil
dren of the Duke and Duchess paraded
the hurricane deck.
The "roads" presented a striking spec
tacle, owing to the great gathering of
warships, dressed from stem to stern, and
with their yards manned and their sides
lined with their crews. Nelson's old flag
ship, the Victory, started the salute to
their Majesties, and each ship in turn
took it up as the Victoria and Albert
moved down the Solent, accompanied by
a flotilla of older royal yachts. Off Yar
mouth, Isle of Wight, the Victoria and
Albert and the Ophir met and exchanged
signals of greeting.
About 2 o'clock the booming of distant
guns signaled the approach of the royal
vessels and the naval procession soon
hove in sight, with the Trinity House
yacht Irene acting as pilot. She was fol
lowed by the Victoria and Albert, the
Ophir and two ironclads. Guns were
fired, bands played and crowds cheered
as the vessels passed down the line of
the fleet.
As the Victoria and Albert neared the
harbor the troops ashore presented arms
and the garrison battery fired a final
salute. The bands everywhere struck up,
"God Save the King," and thousands of
bluejackets on board the ships in the har
bor repeatedly cheered the royal party.
The demonstrations were renewed as
the Ophir entered, her band playiii^
"Home, Sweet Home." The Duke and
Duche.ss of Cornwall and York occupied
a conspicuous position on the upper deck
of the yacht, respectively saluting and
bowing in response to the demonstrations
of the thousands of people lining the har
bor.
Immediately after the Victoria and Al
bert and the Ophir were moored at the
jetty the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall
and York joined their Majesties and the
children on board the former yacht.

"Anarchy is the product of disbelief and

pistol at the breast of any prominent
Christian and take him out of politics,
but God will always have another Chris

when this happens at the topmost pinna

solace in her institutions and is comforted
by God."

NOT TO REDUCE
RANSOM DEMAND
Bandits Still Insist on the
Payment of Full
Amount.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Nov. I.â An indispo
sition continues to be manifested by the
brigands holding Miss Stone to surrender
the woman until they have received the
full amount of the ransom they have de
manded. Despite the arguments used by
the American diplomats and missionaries
who are conducting the negotiations, the
brigands have not reduced the sum th^y
originally fixed nor have they intimaUju
any intention of doing so. It is evident
they believe that it- can be raised, and
having played for a large stake they do
not propose to relinquish a portion of it.
Eddy has been furnished with authority
to pay ov*r to Miss Stone's abductors
$65,000 the moment she is surrendered,- but
through the missionaries he is endeavor
ing to induce them to accept a smaller
sum.
Case Is Very Serious.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Nov. I.â The ne
gotiations with the captors of Miss Ellen
M. Stone, the American missionary, ap
pear to be going on so successfully that
her release seems now to be only a mat
ter of days. So far from there being any
confirmation of the rumors of her death
circulating in the Bulgarian border dis
tricts, it Is said here that another letter
written two days ago has been received
from her.
Later in the day, however, the case of
Miss Stone became more serious. The bri
gands are still holding out for the Â£25,000
ransom and it is feared that should they
persist in their demand Miss Stone will
have to be sacrificed. Nevertheless t':e
negotiations are still proceeding.
Anxiety prevails this evening at thd
United States Legation, whence there has
been an active exchange of telegrams be
tween Secretary Spencer Eddy and vari
ous points. Eddy to-day had a long con
ference with Sir Nicholas O'Connor, the
British Embassador here, who is actively
assisting in the efforts to bring about Miss
Stone's release.
May Kill the Captive.
SOFIA, Nov. I.â The best method of
transmitting the ransom demanded by the
brigands for the release of Miss Ellen M.
intone, the abducted American missionary,
and of assuring the safety of the captives,
are the matters now engaging the atten
tion of the Samakov missionaries, v.ho
are negotiating with thr kidnapers. It is
felt that unusual precautions are neces
sary in order to safeguard Miss Stone and
the others, as there undoubtedly is dun
g^r that the captives will be murdered
after the ransom is paid.

( Lydia E. Pinkham's t Vegetable
Compound.
If she is one of the favored daughters of wealth, âif she belongs
even to the realm of the " well-to-do/ - or -if she belongs to the un-
numbered thousands who must work in order to live â the story is
just the same ; all suffer from about the same cause, and in tnis suf-
fering "peculiar to women," all reach the same level, arid all are of the
same family.
When a woman is nervous and irritable, head and back acne, feels
tired all the time, loses sleep and appetite, has pains in groins, bearing
down sensation, whites and irregularities, she is not "worn out, but
feels as if she were.
Such symptoms tell her that a womb trouble is imminent, and she
cannot act too promptly if she values her future comfort and happiness.
The experience and testimony of some of the most noted women of
America go to prove, beyond a question, that Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound will correct all such trouble at once by remov-
ing the cause and restoring the organs to a healthy and normal condition.
If in doubt, write Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass., as thousands do,
Mrs. Pinkham Tells Mrs. Scott How to be Cured.
" Dear Mrs. Pixkham : â I have been for some years a great sufferer and
thought I would write and explain my case to you as you had helped so
many others. Menstruation is irregular and .very painful. I hare suffered
with painful periods for ten years but the pains grow worse as I grow older.
" I suffer most with my back, lower part of abdomen an 1 left side. I have
been flowing all the month and a part of August, not constantly, but will
stop for two or three days and then begin again.
" The doctor says I have misplacement of the womb. I have bearing down
pains when passing urine, and my abdomen is very badly swollen and sore-
Please advise me at your earliest convenience." â Mrs. A. V. Scott, 21 Page St.,
Kingston, Pa. - (Sept. 30. 1900.)
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham: â When I wrote to you asking advice no onÂ»
could describe my suffering. The doctors said I could not be relieved unless
I had an operation performed, but thanks to you and your medicine I got
along without . having the dreaded operation. I have taken ten_ "bottles of
your medicine and am once more well and happy. JLydia E. Pilikliam's
Vegetable Compound is a fine medicine and a God-send to suffering
women. , I trust my letter may be the means of bringing many of my suffer-
ing sisters to accept your kind" aid." â Mrs. A. V. Scott, 21 Page St., Kingston,
Pa. (Jan. 30, 1901.)
Remember Mrs. Pinkham's advice is free, and all sick women
are foolish if they do not ask for it. No other person has such
vast experience, and has helped so many women.

Golden Jubilee Fair a Success.
Because of the immense crowd that has
nightly frequented the Golden Jubilee
Fair at the San Francisco Turn Verein
Hall the management has been forced to
adopt a policy of expansion. On the upper
floor the library- room has been added to
St. Pauli, while on the lower part of the
house the basement has been transformed
into Auerbach's cellar. To-night an ex
cellent musical programme will be ren
dered by the following clubs: Alpenroesle,

THE last nail has been driven
into chat wonderful doll's house
that is sure to be one of the most
interesting features of the forth
coming doll show. For three
whole weeks carpenters were kept busy
with the miniature mansion, and yester
day the painter and frescoer and paper
hanger took possession of the doll resi
dence and will keep steadily at work at
it until the house is painted and papered
throughout. Tf the D. D.'s want to have
that house ready and in place on the day
the show opens they will have to impress
upon their workmen that they have no
time to lose. The house has ye*- to be
wired throughout. There are eight rooms
to be carpeted and furnished, a no small
task, for each room is to be different in
style and epoch.
FISH-PACKING FIRM
SITED BY STOCKHOLDER
James Craig Asks That Hume Bros*.
& Hume Be Restrained From
Fulfilling Contract.
James Craig, a stockholder in the firm
of Hume Brothers & Hume, fish packers,
filed a suit yesterday for an Injunction
to restrain the directors of the corpora
tion from consummating a deal whereby
the property of the incorporation is dis
posed of to the Pacific Packing and Navi
gation Company.
Craig alleges that the outstanding in
debtedness of the first-named firm at
the time the contract was made was in
excess of $280,000 and that the amount the
terms of the contract provided should be
accepted for the property was not in ex
cess of the debt.
He alleges that the proposed contract is
subversive of the purposes for which the
firm of Hume Brothers & Hume was in
corporated, in that it contemplates the
cessation of canning and packing of fish
and the substitution therefor of a busi
ness which consisted solely of the holding
of the capital stock of another corpora
tion.
He claims that conveyances to the prop
erty should be deposited In escrow with
the Canadian Bank of Commerce and
should be held until three-fourths of the
capital stock of the firm of Hume Broth
ers & Hume should be deposited in the
bank.
He prays the court to rescind the con
tract and to issue an order compelling the
return of the property disposed of and
for an order enjoining the bank from pay
ing over moneys.

LADIES' TAILORING HOUSE
YIELDS LARGE PROFITS
Mrs, Bowhay Claims It Pays $1500
Monthly and Her Husband
Says $700.
The attorneys for Margaret May Bow
hay, who is suing A. L. Bowhay, the
ladies' tailor at 516 Sutter St., for divorce
for cruelty, were denied an order yester
day directing Mrs. Bowhay to assume the
management of the business by Judge
Sloss. An exception was taken to the
ruling by her attorneys and ' the court
was notified that a bill of exceptions
would be filed within ten days.
Neither of the parties to the suit was
present in court and the attorneys pre
sented affidavits in support of their
client's claims.
Mrs. Bowhay claims that the ladies'
tailoring establishment was her property;
that her husband was in her employ when
she married him and that since the com
mencement of the action for divorce the
business was going to ruin because she
was not directing it. She also claims that
the profits amount to $1500 monthly.
Bowhay. in his affidavit, admitted that
half of the business was his wife's, but
placed the profits at only $700. He denied
that the business was retrograding and
said he was doing the work of two men
in order to keep it up.
In the motion for the granting of the
order made in behalf of the wife an ap
plication for $500 alimony, pendente lite,
and for counsel fees was incorporporated.
This was also refused, but the Judge cer
tified to his willingness to listen to a
plea for alimony, provided it was made
a separate cause of action.

FREAK ADVERTISING BILL
GOES BACK TO THE BOARD
Supervisors' Judiciary Committee Re
ports on the Measure Without
Any Recommendation.
Supervisor Charles Wesley Reed ap
peared before the Supervisors' Judiciary
Committee yesterday to urge the passage
of a new ordinance prohibiting freak ad
vertising. The old measure was declared
invalid by a Police Court Judge because a
proviso permitted certain advertising by
beneficial organizations. Reed argued
that the proviso invalidated the whole or
dinace, but Brandensteln held differently.
The committee finally decided to return
the bill to the board without recommenda
tion.
The claim of the Stetson-Renner Dray
ing Company for $118 for damages sus
tained by the destruction of three punch
eons of wine during the strike was re
jected, as there is no fund to pay it. It is
probable that a suit will be commenced.
The City Attorney was instructed to be
gin suits of ejectment against those ille
gally holding possession of lands situated
in the bed of the old Mission Creek. The
Board of Works was directed to fence in
the lands so as to take possession on be
half of the city. The land is described as
Mission blocks 1746 and the middle of Mfb
sion Creek.
In the Divorce Court.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by Barti Martlliano against Lena P. Mar
tiliano for desertion, Lena N. Wolf,
against E. A. Wolf for cruelty and Alice
G. Green against Charles E. Green for
cruelty. Decrees of divorce were granted
to Julius Falbe from Hazel Falbe for cru
elty and Felicia Rees from Harry L. Rees
for infidelity. Dr. B. H. Baumelster, who
runs a drugstore at the corner of Twenty
fourth and Dolores streets, was granted
a divorce from Wilhelmina Baumeister
for desertion. Mrs. Baumelster, who filed
a cross-complaint alleging cruelty on the
part of her husband, withdrew her com
plaint, and th-2 couple having fettled the
question of property rights out of court
the decree was granted as prayed for by
Dr. Baumeister.

ROBERTSON RAFT COMPANY
LOSES SUIT FOR DAMAGES
Judge De Haven Renders Judgment
in Favor of the Owners of the
Steamer Czarina.
The Robertson Raft Company "goes
hence" without damages, according to the
decision of United States District Judga
de Haven yesterday. The company had
libeled the steamer Czarina for the loss of
a portion of a log raft which was being
towed from Seattle to San Franciaco. Thd
hawser connecting the raft with the
steamer broke during the night whe.i
within two clays' voyage of San Francisco
and some of the lumber was lost. The li
belant placed the value of the lumber at
$8400. for which sum and for the service-*
of tugs employed by the libelant in recov
ering the raft damages were demanded.
Judge de Haven found that under ths
contract the Czarina people had not con
tracted to deliver the raft at San Fran
cisco, but to do their best to tow it to thlj
port.
Virginia has more educated negroes
than any other State !n the South In

JOCKEYS WILL SPORT SILK AT THE OPENING TO-DAY OF THE WINTER SEASON'S RACING
GREAT FIELD
IN HANDICAP.
Cracks of the East Will
Measure Strides With
the Local Sprinters
THE fall and winter racing season
of 1901-^2 will be Inaugurated at
Oakland track this afternoon
under the regime of the New Cali
fornia Jockey Club. Turfmen
from every point of the universe are here;
the greatest stables of America will be
represented; a fortnight more and all of
the crack jockeys of the East and West
will be- sporting colors. Layers of odds
nre in plenty, and nothing but sue-
cess can be predicted for the meeting.
With the hundreds of thoroughbreds
that have been ready for the government
test a full week or more at the track over
the bay, it was fully expected the card
for the opening day would be a stunning
one. There is no disappointment on that
score, for it surpasses all predecessors.
By dropping down the scale of weights in
the rich Opening handicap J. W. Brooks
has furnished an exceedingly perplexing
problem. Between fast workouts and
figures that never lie the "mysterious
students of the midnight oil" were divided
last night between Autolight. Nones, Fa
yonius, Obia, Sir Hampton, Hagerdon and
Rio Shannon. This is encouraging and
makes it look an easy thing to guess.
For a time there will be one temporary
setback, and one that will be impossible
to remedy until the close of the Eastern
racing season. Jockeys will be a scarcer
article than automobiles on the park
speedway- that is, fashionable ones. Win
nie O Connor is due to arrive on Tuesday
next. He will be followed by Bullman,
Spencer, Cochran, Wenderly, Winkneld,
Turner and others of the smart set. Until
then Ruiz, Hoar, Romero, See, Burlin
game, Johnny Woods. J. T. Woods. J
Ransch and Stuart will shine as stars of
the silken colors. All are good riders,
especially Johnny Woods and J. Ransch
but as yet have failed to hit the $15,000
notch. Ransch was considered about the
best light-weight on the Chicago tracks,
and Woods returns wonderfully improved
it is claimed. '
In the judges' stand Joseph A. Murphy
of St. Louis will preside, but his associate,
E. C. Hopper, will not be here until next
â¢week. Jake Holtman, whose work bor
dered on the marvelous at the Chicago
tracks, will occupy the starter's box.
Yielding to the wishes of both the public
arid horsemen in general, the Jockey club
officials decided to abolish the recall flag

Crowninshield Boat of the
Independence Type Is to
Try for Challenge Cup
Despite the heavy rain which fell last
Saturday night the dance of the San
Francisco Yacht Club at Sausalito was
quite successful and well attended. It was
the last social event of the yachting sea
son. The fleet of the San Francisco Yacht
Club is now scattered in various places
in winter quarters. Commodore W. N. Mc-
Carthy's schooner Ramona being almost
the only boat now at anchor off the club
house.
The Crowninshield-designed yacht which
is being built for the San Francisco Yacht
Club was to have been completed on Octo
ber 26, but the builders asked for twenty
more days, in which time it is expected
that she will be launched. Her sails havo
been in this city for some weeks and will
be bent as soon as the boat is ready A
crew of members of the San Francisco
Yacht Club will then be made up to try
the sailing qualities of the boat. She is of
a type almost new to this bay, the sloops
Doris II and Discovery being the only
ftnkeel craft hore. She is of the samÂ»
general type as Crownlnshield's Independ"
ence and Is expected to win the Perpetual

FAST GREYHOUNDS
MAY BE MATCHED
D. J. Healey Endeavoring to
Bring Sisquoc and Beacon
Together at Union Park
D. J. Healey, the Petaluma coursing
man, thinks he has in Sisquoc the fastest
greyhound in America. He makes this
declaiation, having in mind the defeat of
the crack from his kennel by A. R. Cur
tis' great blue dog Beacon in the John
Grace cup stakes. He offers to place $100
in a sweepstakes, the owner of Beacon lo
put up a like amount. The management
of Union C -ursing Park has offered to add
$50. It only remains for Mr. Curtis to de
clare himself in and the match will be
complete.
In the John Grace cup, which Beacon
won, Sisquoc ran like a champion until
just before the semi-finals. In this he
and Charta were slipped to a hare which
ran them foriSver three minutes. Sisquoc
won by a score of 28 to 12. In the next
round he met Beacon and suffered defeat.
It is to wipe out this, if posr.-ible, that his
owner seeks the proposed match. If ar
ranged it will be best two out of three
courses.
James Sweeney has returned with the
Pasha Kennel dogs from the meetings at
Madison, S. D., St. Louis, Mo., and
Friend, Nebr. Rural Artist and Rocker
are in good shape and will start this week.
The open stake will be run down once
to-day at Union Park, leaving the re
maining rounds and all the special stake
for to-morrow's card.
OLYMPIC TO MEET
RELIANCE ELEVEN
Athletic Club Teams Will
Play Thanksgiving Day on
Sixteenth-Street Grounds
The Thanksgiving day football game
this year v.ill be between the teams rep
resenting Olympic and Reliance Athlet.c
clubs.
For a time it seemed there would be no
game on the day which for many years
.past has been marked by the annual meet
ing of the rival college teams in this city.
The Olympic Club uirectors clinched the
matter last night and tne men will resume
practice at once. The choice of the Olym
pians lay between the Oregon Indians and
Kelianct. Ihey wisely cnose the latte*
and more formidable team.
It is expected each team will be
strengthened by the addition of some of
the men who will represent Berkeley and
Stanford one week from to-day in the in
tercollegiate game.
For the first time since IS% the Olympic
Club assumes the expenses of the team
flying the winged "O." The colleges, find
ing it necessary to have outside teams
which will afford their men practice be
fore the big game, have guaranteed the
expenses each year of two teams. The
necessary practice having been obtained
the guarantee lapses. The Olympic direc
tors at their meeting last night assumed
these obligations when the collegians
abandoned thorn.
Both teams have played some good
games this; year and much interest cen
ters around their meeting.
STANFORD MEN GROW JUBILANT;
BERKELEY ADMIRERS ARE GLUM
Cardinal Team Gains in Speed and Offensive Work,
While Blue and Gold Eleven Is Reported in an
Unsatisfactory Condition From Various Causes
BERKELEY. Nov. 1.-With but a
week's time before the intercoi
legiate game California's eleven
is still In an unsatisfactory con
dition: The work of the team as
a whole has not come up to the expecta-
tions of its supporters, nor has the eleven
reached the degree of proficiency Its
coaching would seem to warrant. Condi
dons have bear, against California. From
the start there has been a lack of mate
rial, and this scarcity of players has been
augmented by a series of unfortunate ac
cidents and deliberate desertions from the
ranks. At present the squad is made up
of but thirty men, and on occasions it
has been reduced by temporary accidents
to barely two elevens. Such circum
stances are discouraging alike to players
and coaches.
California's eleven weighs under the
average. It will not reach Stanford's
weight by nearly ten pounds to the man.
This is a condition that cannot be helped,
but the team's lack of aggressiveness as
a unit is something which will tend to
ward defeat unless overcome. Not that
aggressiveness is an unknown quantity
to the team, for the men have shown In
past games that they can be aggressive
if they will. There are individual men
who crash into opposing lines with all the
spirit and determination that any man
could have.
Several men have already secured their
positions beyond a doubt, but other places
are being contested for in a manner which
will puzzle the coaches to pick the suc
cessful candidate. Particularly is this
true at quarterback, where two men of
practically equal but different kinds of
ability are opposed to each other.
Barring accidents Gendotti will play
center. Early in the season he had More
head, the freshman, as an opponent of
ability, but a dislocated shoulder put
Morehead out, leaving the present center
the only available candidate. Gendotti
is light for the position, weighing only
165 pounds. Ht is a good player for hi
weight and is given credit for trying
hard. Overall at right guard is big and
strong and has all the physical requisites
His steady an 1 reliable playing could be
improved by more aggressiveness. His
punting has oeen good, and during the
past few games he has averaged forty
yards. In spite of much practice his place
kicking has not improved like his punting
nor as it should. His position on the
team is assured. Stow at left guard has
been handicapped by a bad shoulder His
playing., however, has been a disappoint
ment in all games which have been held
this year. His strength and experience
would seem co warrant better support
than he has given the team. .- **
Larry O'Toole had a splendid chance to
make left guard, but recently he hand* l
in his suit and left the field! Hendrick^
is a steady sub-guard. Lack of we slit
and strength are against him. Stroud is
a heavy freshman who is coming toth*
front for guard. He played center on his
team this year, and was being tried out
for that position on the varsity when th

I.â That the cardinal elev
gainingr the much desired spee>l
was evidenced by their work
against Reliance last Saturday.
In practice during the week the big team
has made a better showing than at any
time this season. Their offense is faster
and the defensive work is fair, although
there is still considerable room lot im
provement. Couch Fickert expresses him
self as well satisfied with the play of
the big eleven, but oomplains of tne lack
of second eleven material which is so
necessary in order to develop the varsit>,
especially In their defense,
.However, the second eleven, although
there axe not many players from which
to^hooae it, is a strong aggregation and
has shown well in the practice this week,
even holding the varsity on downs on
several occasions. Butterfleld, who hai
been playing half anc. end on the second
eleven, has shown a remarkable Knactc
in breaking through the varsity and
tackling benind the line. If he can keep
up the improvement .n his game he wi I
give someoody a hard tight tor the va

men have come out on the field and have
been lining up on the second, notably

and Van Sickle. Either Parker or Ken
nedy, who have been alternating at full
back's position on the second eleven, wu!
make a good substitute full should Slaked

The greatest tlrawtack in the cardinal
line-up at present is the lack of good men
at the ends' positions The loss of Boren.
who was looked upon as a fixture at iett
end. has materially weakened the team
and Stanford's chances on November 9. as
California's specialty appears to be end
running. Cooper ha 3 returned to the
"grid" and is lining up regularly at right
end, but the condition of his spranied ankle
will not allow rim to play his usual fas;
game. Clark, Kuhn and FreshmajQ Tar
pey seem to be in the lead for the pos.
tion at the opposite end of the line. Luck.
Sefton, Preston, W. Dole and Wilbur ara
also fighting hard for the position.
In Traeger and McFadden the cardinal
has two tackles that would be hard to im
prove on. McFadden advances the ball
as well as Traeger. although this Is b-.tf
first year at tackle's position. "Bill's '
place kicking, nowever. makes him th*
most valuable man on the eleven, with
the possible exception of Raitt. Hauver

other men out for the position on the var

The game to-morrow with the Univer

criterion for judging the comparative
strength of Stanford and California.
There is not nearly the feeling of confi
dence among the cardinal "rooters" in re
gard to the outcome of the big game on
November 9 that there was earlier in the
season. The line-up to-morrow will be

to scare Whipple into working hard for
half. Womble' s play improved after the
change, although old-tlmera who have
watched his work since he made the var
sity in his freshman year declare that he
is not up to the form he displayed during
his second season for California. His
work, although high in standard, lacks
the grit of Womble of old.
There comes a story from Stanford that
Womble is a marked man. For real or

to let him play out the first half. Stan
ford has always held a grudge against
Womble since Murphy, the Palo Alto ido!
played with a broken rib, for the cardinal
men have claimed that Womble played
bad ball against Murphy. Berkeleyanu
have always deniel the charge, but the
prejudice against Womble was never ef
faced.
Hudson has been playing at both left
end and quarter and may play either in
the big game, although the latter position
will more likely f;ill to him. Star-
Dibblee put up practically equal ball at
end. Both are light. Dibblee plays hard,
but a wrenched knee has put him from
the field and 'is likely to keep him out of
the game. Starr's sin Is loafing-. His play
is fierce when he gets at it. Buchanan
was a promising end candidate when ill
ness, caused by an injury, took him from
the gridiron. Williams, on the second
eleven. Is a good end man, considering his
light weight.
Who wjjl play quarter is a puzzling
question. More and Hudson are the
candidates. More played last year at

Jeff is in condition to enter the ring at
a moment's notice. He is fit to go any
distance at a terrific pace. He is strong,
Trained to the hour and extremely fast
for a big man. Jeff will not say that he
is going to adopt other than a crouching
position when he fights Ruhlin. It is
second nature for him to bend low and
then launch his heavy blows. As soon as
Gus, or in fact any other man, goes after
him he drops back into the crouching
position for which he is noted, and when
he rises a trifle to send in a blow some
thing is sure to drop.
Although perspiring freely, Jeff was not
tired after his boxing. He attacked the
bag with renewed vigor and for ten min
utes made the sounding board thunder
.with his heavy blows. The rowing ma
chine caught his eye at this time and he
spurted a couple of miles. A brisk rub
down ended his day's work. He then
started out looking for fun, and he found
it at the expense of his training mates.

who are rusticating at the springs. The
couple were put visiting and Jeff and his
assistants led a goat and a mule into the
back parlor of their cottage. An " arm
ful of hay was thrown on the bed for the

AMATEUR BOXERS
IN ROUGH BOUTS
Give and Take Hard Knocks
in the Roped Ring of San
Francisco Athletic Club
Ed Martin won a well earned decision
over Billy Ingham in four fast rounds at
the San Francisco Athletic Club's month
ly boxing bouts which were decided last
night in the Sixth-street gymnasium. The
bout was the event of the evening. At
the sound of the gong Martin went at his
man and some lively slugging ensued.
Ingham bored in often, but Martin met
him with straight lefts in the face and
soon had him in dizzy atmosphere. He
led often and landed hard on Ir.gham's
face. The second round was a repetition
of the first, Martin landing jolt after Jolt
on Ingham 's body and face.
When they came up for the final round
Martin, who was the better ring general,
drew Ingham out by clever feinting and
sent hard Jolts to the jaw. Both mixed it
willingly, but Martin's well directed lefts
and rights put him on Easy street.
Pete Carroll and Joe Crowell boxed a
good draw. J. Fairbanks and Kid Parker
furnished an excKing contest. In the first
two rounds they fought cautiously, but in
the third round Parker sent a right cross
cunter to Fairbanks' point and he wob
bled to the floor. When he got up Parker
shot a left to his stomach, which put him
on the mat again for the count. Fair
baiiks was game, however, and in a mix
up he caught Parker on the jaw and sent
him down. The crowd yelled itself hoarse
as the two feather-weights kept each
other on the floor alternately. In the last
round both scored several knockdowns
and the Judges declared the bout a draw.
Al Whiteman and Ed McQuaid boxed so
evenly the judges ordered another round.
They declared it a draw. The bout sched
uled between Joe King and Hugh Friel
was declared off .because Friel failed to
pass the doctor's examination, and King
was pitted against Pete McGee. McGee
scared King out of his wits by hitting
with one hand free in the clinches and he

Greggains ordered King out of the ring.
Joe Rix, who proved himself a clever

Estee Must Pay Note.
Judge Hunt yesterday rendered a ver
dict in favor of the plaintiff in the suit
instituted by Isaac Trumbo against M. M.
Estee for $5000, the face value of a promi3
sory note executed by Estee in October
1897, and for $2460 interest. The defensi
set up the plea that the statute of limita
tion prevented the collection of the note,
bxit it was proven by Trumbo's counsel
that Estee had at the time the note was
made waived the statute, with the under
standing that he was to render legal ser
vices in return for the amount of the
note.
Cyclist Wells Seriously 111.
Charles S. "Wells of this city, at one
time one of the most representative cycle
racing men in America, is reported dan
gerously ill in New York. Advices re
ceived by friends in this city are to the
effect that his brother, who went to New
York to bring him home, found him too
weak to be moved. The trouble is said to
be in his lungs.
TENNIS PLAYERS
SHOW ACTIVITY
Throng Local Club Courts
to Compete in Friendly
Rivalry or Special Games
Tennis at present is experiencing a
boom that has never been equaled since
its introduction on the coast. The short
ening days have heretofore been respon
sible for a decided falling off in the at
tendance on the local courts, but this
year the courts are crowded both morn
ing and afternoon. Many new players
have joined the ranks lately. The ma
jority of them are promising.
Some of the new men who are expected
to develop into good players in a short
time are J. Gibson Gorham, H. Schmidt.
Hugh Hume and Judges Sloss and Kerri
gan.
During the last two years few ladies
have played on the local courts, but of
late they have been taking up the game.
At present there are some promising lady
players in the California Club who prac
tice almost every day. The ladies who
are showing the most improvement are-
Misses Whitney, Smith, Giesting, Hawes,
Mills, Meyer and Mrs. Older. Mis 3 Laura
Farnsworth, who was formerly one of the
best lady players of the California Club,
has taken up her racket again and is fasc
regaining her former skill.
Charles Kuehn, the winner of the third
class, caused a genuine surprise last Sun
day by carrying off the honors in the class
singles tournament. His chances for first
prize were not considered good, but he
won by good, steady play, aided by a
liberal handicap. Kuehn seemed to make
but little headway when he commenced
playing, but has shown considerable im
provement of late.
H. E. Routh. by winning the singles
tournament held on the Golden Gate Park
courts last Sunday, becomes the first
champion of the park. None of the Cali
fornia Club cracks entered. Routh had
little difficulty in winning. Dunlap,
Routh's partner in doubles, is said to be
more skillful than the champion, but was
unable to take part. G. K. Bates, Routh's
opponent in the finals, played a good
game, but lacked the latter's experience.
The California Club will hold a handicap
doubles tournament for the Davis cups
to-morrow. The holder? of the cups are
the Smith brothers. Grant Smith has
won the cups twice with Cornell as a
partner, and will therefore play with him
Sunday. Collier and Crowell will prob
ably be the only scratch team. Many new
teams composed of young players will
enter. These teams are: Schmidt and Gib
son, Kuehn and Erskine, Strmgham and
Salisbury.
On Wednesday afternoon there will be
a mixed doubles tournament on the Cali
fornia courts.
li&vigne and Hea^erty Matched.
George Lavigne and Tim Heagerty
signed articles last night for a twenty
round boxing bout before the Acme Club
of Oakland on December 10. The men will
weigh in at 130 pounds at 3 o'clock on tvÂ«
day of the fight.

Builds a Road for His
Trainer, Charlie Goff,
to Latter's Surprise
OUS RUHLIN has shown a fond
ness for marked diversion in his
training. Gus is a crank on the
subject of novelty and yesterday
afternoon, instead of working
himself all out in the gymnasium, he
climbed to the top of the Six-Mile House
hill and essayed the role of rock breaker
and road builder in one. In this capacity
Ruhlin displayed strength that was sim
ply marvelous.
Charlie Goff, one of Ruhlina .rainers,
lives with relatives at the top of the hill.
In winter the road to Goff's house be
comes so muddy as to be practically im
passable. After dinner yesterday Goff
mentioned the inconvenience a spell of
wet weather caused himself and family
and spoke of hiring men to build an ave
nue from the main road to his house
"Say, Charlie, I'll build that read for
you if you promise to run with me every
morning for a week,' said Ruhiin
"You're on," chirped Gotf. thinking
Ruhlin was joking; but Gus. who had
been in the neighborhood the previous
day, had sized up the situation and knew
just how to go about it. At the top of
the hill is a rock nuarry owned by a man
named Tom Riley, a good-natured Irish
man, who is in for any kind of a lark
Ruhlin started toward the nuarry, fol
lowed by Goff and Denver Kil Martin
both of whom were laughing at the big
fellow s determination to build a road.
"He doesn't know what, kini^of a job he'a
tackling," said Goff t'> the colored boxer
"Why, it would take two men win wheel
barrows hauling rock all day to pile uj>
enough rock to bulk! the road."
Whpn Ruhlin arrived at the quarry ha
was met by the affable owner of the rock
pile. Gus told Riley he wanted to break
some rock and haul it away and the
irishman smiled knowingly at Goff and
Martin and. pointing to the hillside, tol.i
Ruhlin to go ahead. Ruhlin secured a bia
sledgehammer and went at the rock pile
as it it were so much glass. He pounded
ternhc blows on the body of rock and
each time he crumbled as much as would
a piledriver. After a half hour's har-1
work, during which time the spectators at
tracted to the scene were amazed at Huh
lins wonderful strength. there was
enough rock on the ground to build two
roads to GolTshoiM* Then Ruhlin
treated Goff and Martin to the surprise ol
the day.
"Wait till I got dis yere wheelbarrow,
Gus, laughed Martin, making a :nove to
ward a nearby wheelbarrow. "Wheelbar
row nothing." answered Ruhlin, with a
disdainful smiie, 'Tin going to take aii
this rock in one load, and i'm zoin* to
use that big cart."
So Gus went over and took hold of the
ponderous cart and placed it against the
rock pile asi if it were a toy. '
The big Akron boxer shoveled the rocks
into the dump cart and then coolly pickW
up the shafts and pushed the ca
Goff's house. The feat was a wonderful
show of strength. Ruhltn's muscles
strained and quivered under the ponder
ous weight, but he was easily equal to the
test. Ruhlin intends to m.-.ke Â«ood his
boast and finish the road on his return
from Redwood, where he goes this after
noon. Gus will box with Joe McAuliffa
at the opening of the latter' a gymnasium
to-night at Redwood, and Sunday he will
walk back to his training quarters, a dis
tance of about twenty miles. Ruhlln fig
ures that when a man is in shape for a
tight trips of this kind do him more good
than two days' regular routine.
Ruhlin took his eight-mile spin as usual
yesterday morning, and fan the afternoon
spent an hour in the gymnasium.
Henry Blanken says Ruhiin Is the most
useful man about the house that ever
appeared there in the role of a tighter.
"He can cut more wood in a minjte than
a hired man can in a week," .sail Henry
yesterday. "Ail I have to do is to tell
Gus the woodpile is getting low ar.u he is
out of bed in the morning before we're
up and by breakfast time he has enough
cut to last a week. Since Â¦ iown
here I haven't given a woedenopper a
job."

The Lumber Market.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says:
"Never before during the last few years" his
tory has the lumber trade enjoyed such a
leign of prosperity as during the last month.
Orders have been plentiful, while the quota
tions are encouraging from every standpoint.
The manufacturers and dealersâ wholesale, job
. bing and retailâ have had about all the busi
ness they could satisfactorily attend to. Red
wood and pine have equally shared in the
general Improvement In business and the mills
all over the coast, especially in California,
, have been rushed to fill the orders from for
eign and domestic sources.
"During the month the redwood manufac
turers have placed their base prices up a
trifle and the prospects point toward a fur
ther rise In the next fortnight. This Is a
vise movement and shows the education going
or. in the appreciation of what stani the man
ufacturers should take regarding their output.
Redwood and pine have been selling at too
1 m prices and the conditions of ade have
demanded these lower rates. All this is now
changed and the dealers demand better quota
tions. Contractors and builders are not cb-
Jectlr.g to the advance dot I.* the consumer,
lor the betterment of the general commercial
end industrial trade conditions admits of the
Improvement of realty even if construction
prices are higher. The consumer is getting
better rrices for his on goods and so can
aJlurd to stand better quotations affecting JTis
city and country real estate improvements."

EASTERN MARKETS.
.Yrzc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Xov. 1 â The prevailing unset
tlement of speculative sentiment was well il
lustrated by the widely diverse oriinion ex
pressed as to the effect of the renewal of
Government bond purchases by the treasury.
The wavering sentiment shifted somewhat to
the optimist side late in the day, when it be
came known that the offering? of bonds at
the sub-treasury already amounted to $1.:
thus promifinK considerable relief to the :
market. It v.af> urged this morning that the
action of the Secretary of the Treasury might
be taktn as a warning of stringent mun^
ditiene to come, and it was also argued that
the release of treasury funds would simply
ivnÂ« to facilitate the exports of cold. The
closing of the London and Paris exchanges to
day iterved to obscure somewhat the qu<
of the foreign situation and gave opportunity
for a number of favorable Influences, a few
storks show strong- gains and the leaders in
activity are a pÂ«int above yesterday In a num
ber of csiseg. Baltimore and Ohio was con
spicuous in the late dealings and it rose 2\
Â¦without definite news. Pennsylvania had tji<Â»
benefit nf the extra dividend declared, thu*
making the return to stockholders 6 per cent
for the ea!endar year, or the same as last
year. The preliminary figures of the movement
A disclosed the fact that the current of
the interior movement has turned toward New
York, 'he net gain as a result of express ship
ments amounting to $1,830.85 E. The statement
of cub-treasury operations Includes in Its net
result the payments on gold account at Pacific
Coast points, the transfers of currency through
that institution and the withdrawals of gold
for export which effect a loss to the hanks j
of $3,925,000. The loss In cash by the banks '
on all accounts seems, therefore, to be some- I
thing over $2,000,000 for the week. The easy
condition of the money market" and the action
of the stock market is a pretty clear intimation
of strength by the banks, so that there may be
changes In the loan item to offset the cash
loss. There was a number of conspicuous
movements in less prominent stocks. Minne

Bradstrcct's on Trade.
NEW YORK, Nov. I.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say:
The complaints of car shortages are repeated
this week, In even greater degree. At best,
however, this is only a negatively unfavorable
circumstance and is the best of proof that an
enormous volume of business is doing through
out the country. Unseasonable warm weather
is complained of as interfering with or check
ing retail distribution of clothing, shoes and
other fall and winter goods and dulling the
usual reasserting demand from jobbers East
and West. The holding off of killing frosts at
the South (It Is now one week behind the
average date) has benefited the crop prospects,
but coupled with immediate receipts, has In
duced a raising of estimates and lowered prices
for the week.
wheat has felt the Influence of heavy move
ment of grain at the Northwest, heavy In
creases in visible supply in Manitoba and
rather less critical advances from Argentine.
In addition, tlv; stories of dullness and depres
sion in the export business have affected trade,
though it Is to be noted that wheat and corn
shipments together since July 1 are heavier
than a year age. To smaller export shipments
ol cotton, of Iron and steel and to an over
supply of new tonnage Is probably due the
depression in ocean freights prevalent for
months past. Hog products are lower, it is
claimed, because of packers manipulating the
liog market, but the recent high prices ap-
Xiear to have checked consumption.
Among the staples advancing corn Is promi
nent, though held down slightly by wheat. A
large short interest is said to exist In that
icrain and wet weather and good buying have
stimulated prices of that product and oats
The woolen goods situation is In good shape
and the manufacturers have bought freely,
pales at Boston alone. amounting to 15,000,000 to
20,000,000 pounds. No particular change in iron
and steel Is noted, though the tendency of
hog prices is stronger, prompt shipments In
some cases being 10c per ton premium. Talk
of advancing steel rails |1 to $2 per ton for next
year's delivery- Is also heard. Steel billets are
scarce at Pittsburg and prompt deliveries bring
$27 to $28. In unfinished products, bar Iron,
sheets, plates and structural material are In
unprecedented demand at Chicago. A phenom
enal demand for structural material is noted
at Pittsburg.
Copper maintains Its former strength, an
agreement to restrict production being re
ported among the great Interests.
Wheat, Including flour, exports for the week
aggregate 6.872,868 bushels, as against 4,952,134
bushels last week and 3,618,421 bushels in this
week last year. Wheat exports July 1 to date
(seventeen weeks) aggregate 106,729,273 bushels,
as against 62.500.290 bushels la6t season.
Failures In the United States for the yeek
number 172, as against 223 last week, 165 In
this week a year ago, 174 In 1899 and 183 In
1898.
Canadian failures for the week number 17,
against 16 last week and In this week a year
ago* 21 in 1899, 31 In 1898 and 34 in 1597.
Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, Nov. I.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Â¦weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
Although the latest railway returns Indicate
.that transporting facilities have greatly im
proved, the nation's business has expanded
more rapid'y. Car shortage has in fact become
the chief retarding Influence. From all sec
tions of the country and many lines of In
dustry complaints are heard regarding the In
ability to move goods. Probably the delay has
been most aggravating in the case of coal, un
seasonably high temperature alone prevent
ing serious inconvenience. Not only are do
mestic requirements enormoUF but coal is be
coming an important article if. export, partly
owing to labor controversies in France and
Great Britain and also to the British export
tax. Mild weather afltects retail distribution to
a very marked degree, orders for heavy weight
goods being canceled in some cases where
manufacturers were behind in deliveries. That
the volume of legitimate business is not being
curtailed is evidenced by the increase of bank
exchanges In New York of 27.4 per cent over
last year and 7.23 per cent over the same pe
riod in 1899. In ten other leading cities the in
crease is also striking.
Not only are steel mills many months behind
orders and prompt deliveries commanding pre
miums, but even where goods are ready for
customers it is often Impossible to ship bo
cause of Inadequate railway facilities. Struc
tural material is urgently sought' and mild
weather prolongs the season for buying pipa.
Steel rail orders Increase and the fancy pnoea
asked for billets have brought Imports from
Germany, where industrial depression makes it
possible to sell at very low figures. Domestic
quotations do not alter, though list figures are
not considered on deliveries before the year's
end. Copper is artificially sustained by clos
ing mines.
Footwear manufacturers have made a general
advance In prices, restoring the figures of early
spring. It is obvious that the average rise of
2Vsc does not cover the enhanced cost of ma
terial, yet new orders have been extremely
light since the change, as Jobbers are resisting
the natural tendency. Textile markets are well
sustained. Woolen mills have ample orders
and take large quantities of raw material,
holding wool prices firm.
Irregularity prevailed in. the market for
staples. Speculators secured a distinct decline
trorr. the usually high position recently at
tained for pork products, while at the same
time corn made a further advance. Wheat
came to market freely, arrivals at Western
Cities amounting to 7,060.690 bushels. Atlantic
exports were less satisfactory than last week,
but including all United States ports the week s
shipments were 5,013,108 bushels, against 3,650.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Liverpool futures were firmer. It
was a holiday at Parts. The London Times
confirmed the report that Germany would need
10,000,000 bushels of wheat and 37,000.000 bush
els of rye. The quality of wheat and corn in
the Argentine was reported good, owing to
more favorable weather, there being continued
rains in the Important province of Buenos
Ayres.
Chicago opened firm, but fell back. The
coarse grains led in firmness. Broomhall cabled
from Liverpool that the Continental demand
was improving. The seaboard reported a more
active export business than for some time and
St. Louis also reported a heavy export demand
at higher bids. A heavy increase in the wheat
area was reported in Indiana and westward.
Wires from Minneapolis said that the milling
demand was urgent, the mills being sold away
ahead on flour. There were general rains in
the winter-wheat belt, giving relief there. Of
ferings in the Southwest were small, the farm
ers feeding out wheat to stock In large quan
tities. KanÃas Is especially feeding out wheat
and has already shipped 75 per cent of her
yield and her home needs are greater than
ever. Th-s market was quiet and easy.

CORNâ situation in the West is bullish
and the high prices there forbid shipments to
this market. Western Corn is offered here at
$1 55, but as our local large yellow can be
obtained for the much lower quotations below.
It will be Impossible to bring the Western here
without loss. Western speculation is increas
ing, based on bad husking returns and the
big feeding demand tor the South and West.
Farmers are selling very little and there is
an urgent demand in lowa for Missouri and
Kansas. This demand Is so sharp that the
higher prices are diverting shipments from
Chicago to those States. Snow will Issue an
estimate, placing the crop at about 1.400,000.000
bushels, and all private estimates indicate a
yield below the Government estimate. -
Local prices continue to decline, as will be
seen.

Harrison's circular says:
"During the week there have been thÂ« fol
/ lowing arrivals of coal, viz.: One from Oregon.
720 tons; six from Washington, 13,100 tons; two
from British Columbia. 8375 tons; one from
| Baltimore. 3036. t0n5; two from Swansea. 6600
tons- one from Cardiff, 3021 tons; five from
Newcastle. N. S. W.. 13,775 tons; total. 54,137
tons. The amount delivered here this week
! Is about equal to double the average quantity
! consumed here within the same time. Two
1 thirds of the above amount is Australian and
1 Washington coal. It may inconvenience some
1 of the consignees to take in the quantity that
' their charter parties call for. as most of the
! deliveries will be ex-steamers: hence a large
discharge Is called for. Probably 75 per cent of
the coal above reported has been already dis-
I posed of. so that the market will not be much
disturbed. Cargoes of fuel only suitable for
steam uses which may arrive here seeking buy
ers may have to be disposed of at a loss to
the shipper, as it comes in direct competition
with fuel oil: hence a marked shading in price
has to be conceded. Freight on coal from Aus
tralia and Great Britain must be marked up
higher unless outward grain charters shall
! show some Improvement in th? near future. The
oil business is gradually being controlled by
some' of the larger "and more intelligent oil
i producers, who combined are- laying out plans
whereby the disposal of almost the entire Cali-
I fornia output will rest with them. Thus they

ABUNDANT FOOD
Commissary of Subsist
ence Submits Inter
esting Report.
Enormous Work Done by De
partment in the Phil
ippines.
WASHINGTON. Nov. I.â The report of
General John F. Weston, commissary
general of subsistence, shows that the to
tal expenditures for the subsistence of the
army during the fiscal year were $15,622,
Â£2 S. The receipts from the sales of sub
slstence stores during the same period
ere $3,290,234. An interesting feature of
Jt.ie report is a statement from Colonel
Woodruff, chit-f commissary in the Phil
ippines, in which he says: Â¦
During thÂ» first three month? of the period
covered by this report stores for various causes
t>eoame reduced, but owing to the grand re
j-;.cnse ma 3? by the commissary general to
every call :rom this office and the energetic
action or the purchasing commissary in San
Francinco aad in New York this was speedily
corrected and this division was soon supplied
as no army of its s:ze has ever been supplied
:n the world's history.
During tha period covered by this report the
command to be supplied extended from the
Great Wall of China on thjs north to the island
of Borneo on the south and the island of Guam
on the east. There were 4mj stations In this
ij-cbipelajro. besides the troops in China and
the .prisoners in Guam.
In addition to the 65.000 troops and 3000 offi
cers in this division the subsistence department
fupplied the delicacies for the sick, rations lor
4000 prisoners of war. many of the stores for
the navy, rations for 1000 civilian employes
snd sales scores for the navy and marine. In
ether word? nearly 100.000 person?, occupying
a country almost destitute of meat and vege
tables and other food eupplies suitable for
Americans, were supplied largely from a single
base 7000 miles disuuit.
After the Etcres reached Manila they had to
be landed i:i cascos arid were then distributed
by short railroads and then poled up narrow
rivers, by vragon and carts, along almost bot
tomless roads, by pack mule* and coolies over
mountain trails, often through a hostile coun
try.
Colonel Woodruff says that during the
period covered by the report 35.000 men
have been returned to the United States
and about IS. OOO have arrived in the Phi!
->^i pines, and not a single serious complaint
".-..is been received concerning the food
topply. There have been received at tha
Manila de;xÂ»t 116.554.530 pounds of ration
articles and C 2,444,9&6 pounds of sale.?
stores. There have been shipped from
'his depot 111.771.509 pounds of ration ar
ticle* and 57,022.671 pounds of sales stores.
There has been me deterioration of
stores on sccount of poor storage and cli
r.atic contritions.
Colonel Woodruff refers to the charges
against the subsistence department and
i-ays such charges were greatly exagrger
arfd. He denies any illegitimate pur
chases of champagne and says that pur
<hf.se< ma2e were necessary for sick and
debilitated troops, vho purchased it at
4^ <'<=r.t.s a pint.
General Weston's report deals quite
.xtensively with the Chinese campaign
and quote t from officers who were in that
expedition to show that the troops were
Â¦well supplied.

Berkeley Men Win Easily.
BERKELEY, Nov. I.â Kaarsberg'g jolly
tars from Vallejo went down to defeat
this afternoon before California's eleven.
The defeat was overwhelming, as the
mariners from the naval station left the
li.-kl with only faint recollections of what
a pigskin felt like, so few times had the
ball been in their possession. Only on
four occasions in the fifteen-minute halves
did Vallejo get the ball, and then it was
lost after a few seconds' play. Twice Cal
ifornia failed to make necessary gains,
once the sailors secured the ball on a fum
ble and once through the college men bo
ing penalized because the backs started
before, the ball was snapped back. At the
close of the game the score was 1(1â0. The
teams were made up from the following
players:
Californiaâ Gendotti, Overall, Hendrlcks,
Stroud, Braly, Hansen, Womble. Wil

LARGE BLAZE
IN SANTA FE
REPAIR SHOPS
Fire at Point Richmond
Causes Heavy Loss
to Railroad.
Two Men Badly Injured by
Being Struck by Fall
ing Timbers.
Flames Break Out in the Paint Room
and for a Time Threaten to
Destroy the Entire
Yards.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 1.
Fire at Point Richmond to-night de
stroyed the Santa Fe Railroad's repair
shops and considerable valuable machin
ery. For a time the flames threatened the
roundhouse, immense oil tanks, store
house and other large structures at the
railroad yards. The loss to the company
will reach $125,000. During the progress of
the tire two men were badly injured. Wil
liam Fitzgerald was severely burned
about the arms and face and Frank Bai
ley was struck on the head by falling tim
bers. The loss is a serious one to the
company, for nearly all of the valuable
machinery of the repair shops has been
made worthless, and several weeks must
elapse before the company can replace it.
Shortly after 6 o'clock this evening
flames broke out in the paint room, at the
rear of the shops adjoining the temper
ing furnace. Before an alarm was sound
ed the end of the big wooden structure
was enveloped in flames, and the heavy
black clouds of smoke pouring from the
burning building indicated that the fire
had a good hold upon the frame building
and its highly inflammable contents. Toot
ing whistles summoned the workmen and
yard employes to the scene. Scores of men
aided the local Fire Department and the
yard engines in the desperate fight that
was made to prevent the spread of the
fire.
Locomotives Saved After Hard Fight.
The building was a temporary structure,
60 by 120 feet, and was used to shelter the
extensive repair and mechanical depart
ment until permanent brick buildings
could be erected. As the fire spread at
tention was ti.rned to the roundhouse,
only twenty-five feet away, where a
dozen big locomotives were standing.
These were run out as rapidly as possible
and by desperate efforts were saved from
the encroaching flames. The terrific heat
retarded the flre-fighters, and the dozens
of streams pumped from tanks by the
switch and yard engines were unavailing
to save any portion of the big repair
shop. All that could be done was to pre
vent the fire from spreading to the other
buildings, and particularly to the great
oil tank, only a few hundred feet away,
which contained thousands of gallons of
oil. Fortunately the evening was calm
and the absence of high wind was a ma
terial factor in the fight to prevent the
burning of â¢ the immense oil storage tank.
For an hour the danger was so great that
none believed the yards would be saved.
The adjacent shops and other buildings
were saved, however, and the fire spent
itself upon the repair shops and small
lean-tos connected with them.
It was during the hardest moments of the
battle that Bailey received his injuries.
He had been working with a crew close
to the burning shops when there was Â«i
sudden crash and down came a mass of
half-burned timbers. He was struck by
part of the wall and knocked senseless.
His companions quickly dragged him
away and he was placed under physi
cians' care. Fitzgerald fell through a
window while fire-fighting and was also
struck by falling timbers.
Repair Department Destroyed.
All that was saved of the repair depart
ment was a boiler shed and a boiler. The
origin of the fire is unknown. It is sup
posed that benzine in the paint room be
came ignited by spontaneous combustion
after the mechanics had loft the place for
the night. Although the furnace in the
tempering department was close by it had
not been in service for several days. That
was not the source of trouble, so the rail
road men believe.
Whether any of the machinery will be
serviceable again cannot be ascertained
until the metal cools and the debris from
the burned building is hauled away. The
railroad people are fearful that every
thing in the building will be a total lose,
and will have to be sold for old junk. The
machinery alone was valued at more than
$10fi,000. This loss, with that to the build
ing and material on hand, will make the
total close to $125,000.

SAY MINISTER
MADE AN ERROR
Washington People Are
Astonished at Por
tugal's Action.
Change in Diplomats a
Probable Result of
Carelessness.
LISBON, Nov. I.â Senor Hota Machadoe
has been appointed Portuguese Minister
at Washington.
WASHINGTON, Nov. I.â Shortly after
the death of President McKinley the Vis
cunt de Santo-Thyrso, Portuguese Min
ister to the United States, was summoned
to Lisbon. According to M. Louis Agusto
de Maura Pinto d'Azendo Taveria, at
present Charge d' Affaires of Portugal in
this city, the Viscount was not made
aware of the purposes of his summons to
the Portuguese capital. M. Taveria said
to-day that further than this he knows
nothing in regard to the report that the
Viscount's removal to Portugal had to do
with a premature announcement of the
death of President McKinley.
W r h.en asked whether an error of this
sort from a diplomatic representative
would be regarded as sufficient ground for
his recall, M. Taveria says that it all de
pended on the temper of the Government
In question.
The State Department expressed incre
dulity and surprise when told of the ap
pointment of a new Minister from Portu
gal, and especially of the allegation that
the change was made because of a pre
r.ature announcement of President Mc-
Kinley's death by Santo-Thyrso. This
was the first news that had reached here
that such a change had been made. The
officials were ciuite sure that so far as
tho United States Government was con
cerned, it had not been embarrassed by
any act of the former Minister, for the
records of condolences received at the de
partment disclose the fact that Portugal
conformed closely to the rules observed
by the other nations of the world.
BANK BURGLAR RICE
CONVICTED OF MURDER
Survivor of a Desperate Battle With
Officers Involved in a Con
spiracy.
MONTREAL, Nov. I.â Frederic Rice was
convicted here to-day on the charge of
murdering William Boyd. Rice is the
only survivor of the notorious trio of
Aurora bank burglars. The murder oc
curred on July 4 last. Boyd and another
Constable were escorting the three pris
oners to the jail when some one threw
two loaded revolvers into their carriage.
In the desperate fight for liberty which
followed, Constable Boyd was shot
through the head.
Counsel for the prisoner was granted Â»a
reserve case, because the jury found that
he did not actually do the shooting. They
held that he was guilty of murder, how
ever, on the ground that there was a
conspiracy between himself and the two
other prisoners, Jones and Rutledge. The
other robbers are dead. Jones was killed
in the fight in which Officer Boyd was
killed, and Rutledge committed suicide.
NEGRO AND HIS PISTOL
CAUSES TRIPLE TRAGEDY

toria Anderson, a negro woman, and
found her in the company of a negro
named Charley Williams. He at once
opened fire on Victoria, killing her in
stantly. The weapon was then turned on
Williams, who attempted to escape, but
failed and was fatally wounded. Rawlins
rushed to the door, turned his weapon on
himself and pulled the trigger, dying in
stantly.

STUDENTS TAKE
SATANIC ROLES
Stanford Juniors Par
ticipate in a Weird
Ceremony.
Youths Garbed as Imps of
Darkness Dedicate the
Class Plug.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. I.â
The class of 1903 to-night dedicated ltÂ»
class emblem, the junior plug, with fiery
and vividly infernal ceremonies. The
scene was laid in the lower regions and
the third-year men. rigged out with black
tights and hoods, horns and tails, made
very realistic devils as they surged
through the flames.
The "plug ugly," in accordance with the
custom instituted by the class of 1902, was
held on the gridiron, and the bleachers
were packed with collegians and visitors
from near by towns, who gathered to wit
ness the awful and imposing spectacle.
The Plutonian fires were produced by a
generous use of kerosene on piles of red
wood and old barrels, and the effect of
the light on the black, queerly costumed
figures was weird in the extreme.
The lighting of the fires discovered
Satan and some of the lesser devils
lamenting over their fall from the king
dom of "Soph" to the kingdom of hell.
Soon a large crowd of devils appeared,
showing evidence, by their charred and
disheveled appearance, of the fall into the
lake of fire. They brought tidings of a
land of bliss, far different from their pres
ent realm, in which annoyance by fresh
men, faculty committees and other griev
ances are unknown. "The devil of a long
time ago" spoke up and said that he
knew the way to the land, but that first
a sacrifice must be made. The spirits of
the nether world chose the' dog Cerberus
for the victim, and after considerable
hard work (with the bulldog actually
used) he was led to the lire and offered
up as a sacraflce. In preparing the dog
for the ceremony (a stuffed duplicate "of
the bulldog being used) a scroll and junior
plug were brought forth from his Interior.
The scroll contained the names of several
well known students said to be on the
'black list" of Chairman Green of the
faculty committee on student affairs, the
local hits worked in being exceedingly
clever.
After the discovery of the plug, Satan
sent out the assembled imps to procure
similar ones for themselves, telling them
that only on presentation of such an
emblem would they be allowed to enter
the promised land. They all rushed forth
and returned carrying their plugs.
The juniors ended their ceremony by
marching off the field, all joining in one of
the numerous catchy songs.
The cast of characters was as follows:
Shameless, Swindling Satan J. W. Cameron
Black, Bellowing Beelzebub C. "W. Thomas
Mad, Murderous Moloch F. E. Nangle
Devil-of-a-Coward H. L. Morrison

RURAL MAIL DELIVERY
REACHING ATT, FARMS
Inhabited Territory in the Country
Will Be Covered Within Five
Years.
WASHINGTON. Nov. I.â Within five
years every farmer, as well as every city
resident, will have his mail delivered at
his door. Superintendent Machem of the
free delivery division of â¢ the Postoffice
said to-night:
"The rural free delivery system will be
:n operation over an area of 1,000,009
square miles, and this will include all the
inhabited territory of the I'nited States.
There will be 6000 rural routes in opera
tion by December 1. Of these 1300 were
established until June 30, 1900. During the
fiscal year ending last June. 3000 were es
tablished. There are now on file 6000 ap
plications and they are coming in by hun
dreds from all parts of the country. It
will take us from a year to a year and a
half to dispose of these and in the mean
time others will undoubtedly accumulate.
The department will be compelled to ask
for a much larger appropriation from
Congress next winter than was granted
for the present fiscal year."
HERRINGS' EXPULSION
DISPLEASES YON BULOW
Berlin Officials Surprised at Action
in Case of the American Cor
respondent.
BERLIN, Nov. I.â With reference to the
expulsion from Prussia of Joseph Her
rings, the American newspaper corre
spondent, the Berlin representative of the
Koenigsberg Hartunsche Zeitung says:
"The expulsion greatly surprised Berlin
officials, who see in the police president's
communique to the newspapers evidence
that the police are too zealous for the let
ter of the law. The higher authorities
here knew nothing of the intended expul
sion. The closing sentence of the com
munique is interpreted by the officials to
mean that Count yon Bulow has ex
pressed displeasure at the action of the
police and is willing to give redress."
The whereabouts of Herrings is not
known in Berlin.
THE DAY'S DEAD,

FLOUR EXPLODES
IN BAKER'S FACE
Force of the Concussion
Throws Him Across
the Floor.
Peculiar Accident Occurs
in a San Leandro
Bakery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 1.
By the explosion of a quantity of flour
at his bakery in San Leandro to-day M.
R. Gotschang, the proprietor of the estab
lishment, was badly injured about the
face, hands and shoulders. The furnaoe
was wrecked by the explosion. Gotachang
is unable to account for the accident.
The explosion occurred while Gotschangf
was heating the oven. To quicken the flre
he used a. quantity of flour in addition to
wood and coal. The flour was the re
mainder of a quantity that he had con
demned and some of it had been acci
dentally dampened by water. He shoveled
It into the furnace upon the wood arid
then stood in front of the furnace door.
Suddenly there was a terrific explosion.
Gotschang was hurled across the floor of
the bakehouse. He did not lose conscious
ness, but soon realized that he wad
severely hurt. His shirt was torn in-.o
shreds and his face and the whole upper
portion of his body was bleeding, in a
few moments a crowd gathered, attracted
by the explosion. When Gotsehangr made
his appearance he was taken in charge by
his friends and hurried to his home,
where Dr. Tormey was summoned to at
tend him. Gotschang told the physician
and other 3 that he had put flour into the
furnace, but could not understand why it
should have caused an explosion.
YUKON RIVER NOT YET
IN CXASP OF WINTER
Stream Remains Open and Boa's
Make Eitra Trip to Bring Out
Dawsonites.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. I.â With 240
saloon passengers the steamer City of
Seattle arrived this afternoon from
Skaguay. Most of the passengers were
:rom the Klondike, having come out to
spend the winter. The most interesting
news brought concerning travel was that
the river is still open down to Dawson
and boats which were to have been laid
up for the winter are making their sec
ond extra trip and carrying more passen
gers than ever. After the fall of snaw
and the cold snap of October 1 the weath
er moderated decidedly and the thin
skimmer of ice on the river on October 5
disappeared. Since then it has been still
warmer and the result is that there is a
sort of second season of navigation. Ona
steamer left White Horse for Dawscn
last Monday and another on Wednesday
and both are now probably on their way
out, laden with passengers.
The greatest excitement was over the
finding of an exceedingly rich section of
Lower Dominion Creek. The Govern
ment concessions company operating
there and on Hunker made the find, and
so far a large amount of gravel has been
taken out, going as high as $2 to the pan.

MANAGEMENT OF ST. ELMO HOSPITAL
IS INVESTIGATED BY LUNACY BOARD
FRINCIPAL ACTORS AND WITNESSES WHO WERE CONCERNED IN THE INVESTIGATION HELD YESTER
DAY AFTERNOON UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE STATE BOARD OF LUNACY INTO THE ALLEGED
ABUSES OF PATIENTS AT THE ST. ELMO HOSPITAL.
DR. F. W. HATCH, president of
the State Board of Lunacy, as
sisted by Attorney George L.
Hughes, conducted an investiga
tion yesterday into the alleged
abuses of insane patients at the St. Elmo
Hospital. Eighteenth and Douglass streets.
This hospital was licensed on October 23
tn care for insane patients and a week
later charges of mismanagement of the
Â¦ st kind were made by Dr. John P.
Frizell. the resident physician.
Although the inquiry, according to the
Etatemem made by Dr. Hatch at the be
ginning of the investigation, was to be
confined solely to the treatment of those
mentally unbalanced patients confined in
the asylum, under the charges preferred
by Dr. Frisell the whole subject of the
management of the institution was gone
into and a large mass of testimony was
taken. As to the ownership of the hos
pital, a point which Superintendent Mur
dock tried to evade, it was clearly estab
lished both by his testimony and that of
Dr. Frizell that S. P. Blumenberg, a di

Â«OYAI. BAKING POWDER CO., 100 JBT., NEW YORK,
rector in the Twinkling Star Improvement
Company, owner of the notorious Hotel
Nymphia, was the owner of the place and
that Murdock was his representative un
der a contract to purchase.
The charges preferred in writing by Dr.
Frizell are as follows:
To the State Commission in Lunacy of the
State of Californiaâ Gentlemen: I herewith
present written charges to your honorable body
apainst Alexander Murdock. manager, and the
management of the St. Elmo Hospital and
Sanitarium, situated at 230 Douglass street, San
Francisco, California, of incomnetency of man
agement, cruelty toward patients and also as
to the character of the persons composing the
corporation controlling said hospital.
I hereby specify the above charges as fol
lows :
1. Incompetency of management â The head
nur.-fr. Mlfs la. Dugan, is allowed to administer
medicine to patients without doctors' direc
tion*. She has only had four months' experi
ence as a nurse and is incompetent for her
position. This fact is known to the superin
tendent and management.
2. Cruelty to patientsâ l also charge that Su
perintendent Murdock did give orders for a fe
male patient to be taken out of the room in
which she was placed and be taken to the attic
of the hospital. She was locked in the attic
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1901.
and by reason of his orders suffered from
neglect.
3. Character of perÃona composing corpora
tionâl also charge that the persons composing
the corporation engaged In carrying on the hos
pital are of bad reputation and morally unfit
to be allowed to conduct a hospital for the
care and treatment of persons afflicted with
mental diseases.
Dr. John P. Frizell was the first witness
called. He stated that he was a graduate
of the Kings and Queens College of Dub
lin and had, about six weeks ago, in re
sponse to a reply to an advertisement in
a morning; paper gone to 514 Pine street,
where he met Murdock and Blumenberg
and was by them engaged to act as resi
dent physician at a salary of $300 a month.
Continuing, he said:
The understanding was that I should work
the first two weeks for nothing and see to tho
arrangements at the hospital, which was then |
hardly in a condition to receive patients, al- \
though a few were there. I went ahead and |
took up my residence there. We engaged a j
number of nurses and proceeded to take in i
patients. My first objection was as to the I
competency of Miss Dugan, who had been in
stalled as head nurse.
She had had no previous experience, but un
dertook to dose patients. She told one of the
nurses to give an ounce and a half of essence
of peppermint to an old woman, when twenty
or thirty drops is a big dose. At another time
she proceeded to administer a dose of lauda
num to a patient and was taking enough to
kill a man, when, fortunately, I came Into the
dispensary in time to stop her. Orders given
by me to the nurses were countermanded by
her. She said this was done by Murdock's or
ders. I could not got from the kitchen any
special orders as to diets. I got tired after a
few experiences of this kind and did not make
any further orders for special diets, although
in many instances they were required.
In my opinion the patients did not get
enough or proper food. My orders were con
tinually interfered with.
Dr. Frizell next referred to the case of
the insane patient who was confined in
the attic. He said she was deprived of
every bit of furniture, her meals were
laid on a tray on the floor and one day
for six hours she was allowed to go en
tirely naked as her clothes had been taken
away from her by orders of Superintend
ent .Murdock.
Referring again to the matter of food
Dr. Hatch asked as to its quality. Dr.
Frizell said:
There was mush and milk for breakfast,
roast meat and baked potatoes for dinner and
"leftovers" -for supper. The meat was bad
and in many cases was tainted; in fact, 11 was
unfit to eat. It was insufficient, too, in quan
tity. Patients suffered from the lack of food
and oftentimes could not eat what they got.
When nurses were specially required they could
not be had.
The day after the mother of the young wom
an left she was removed to the attic-room.
Nurse Crap told the superintendent In my pres
ence that the patient would die of cold if not
treated more humanely and Murdock answered
that that was her lookout.
Nurses Sustain Doctor.
Dr. Frizell also referred to the visit of
inspection made by Dr. Hatch, who at the
time. asked to see the resident physician.
Dr. Frizell proved that he was in the
building at the time, but Murdock said
he was out.
"Yes, I remember that you were in the
building when I called," said Dr. Hatch.
The matter of the personnel of the board
of directors was also gone into in sub
stantiation of the last section of the
charges. Dr. Frizell stated that he had
made inquiries and found that the names
of the directors were men who were un
der Blumenberg's control and of no par
ticular standing: in the community.
Miss Mamie K. Brennan was .the next
witness. She was employed as a nurse
and was one of those discharged at the
time Dr. Frizell severed his connection
with the institution. Her testimony was
positive and was not shaken when she
was taken in hand by Murdock for cross
examination. She said in part:
The food was not fit for a dog to eat. The
steaks were so tough that you could not put
your teeth through them. The tea wad like
water. I have seen a female patient treated
roughly by Murdock. He strapped her up so
tight she could not move and when she
screamed with pain and in delirium he stopped
her cries by placing his arm over her mouth
and later gagged her with a towel.
Miss Helen M. Crap, another of the dis
charged nurses, also gave testimony. She
was an attendant on the young woman
who was left without clothing and told of
her complaints to Dr. Frizell, who was
always overruled by Murdock. Her testi
mony was as follows:
When this young woman was placed in the
attic room I was placed in charge of her.
Everything was taken out of her room. There
was not even a chair for her to sit upon. She
was always tractable. At night a mattress
and bed clothing were put in her room. One
day Superintendent Murdock ordered all her
clothing removed, as the night before she bad
CLUBMAN FALLS
FROM A WINDOW
Tragic Death of Cuthbert
P. Gordon at Cosmos
Club.
He Suddenly Becomes Dizzy
From Heart Disease and
Loses Balance.
Cuthbert P. Gordon, a member of the
Cosmos Club, was killed instantly yester
day morning by falling from, a second
story window of the club building to the
sidewalk, a distance of about twenty feet.
The fall is believed to have been acci
dental, as Gordon was suffering from
heart disease, caused by smoking strong
cigars.
Gordon was cashier for Charles Chris
tiansen, insurance agent, and had been in
his employment for twelve years. He re
tired about 11 o'clock on Thursday night
and at half past 8 o'clock yesterday morn
ing he was seen to fall from a window of
his room and strike on his head and
shoulders on the sidewalk. Dr. Plymire,
who was summoned, found that the un
fortunate man had been killed instantly:
Christiansen speaks in the highest terms
of the dead man. He had spent the even
ing in his company and had remarked to
Gordon that he did not look at all well.
Gordon replied that he was not feeling
: well and that his heart was troubling
1 him.
I torn up her nightgown. She was left nude
for several hours.
Miss Crap also testified as to the bad
quality of the food and the lack of deli
cacies oftentimes required by the sick.
A number of other witnesses were ready
to testify to a similar condition of affairs,
but their testimony was not considered
necessary. â , __
In his defense Murdock called Mis 3
Lydla F. Dugan, acting head nurse. Miss
Dugan testified that her flrst experience
in a hospital dated from June 10 of this
year, when she went to the St. Elmo Hos
pital. She denied that she ever com-,
pounded prescriptions, because, she said,
she was ignorant of the character of
drugs. She also denied that she had ever
disobeyed the doctor's orders.
Murdock admitted that for over a year
before going into the hospital he had an
office with Blumenberg at 514 Pine street.
He denied that Blumenberg was interested
in the hospital, but later, on cross-ex
amination by Doctor Hatch and Attorney
Hughes, admitted that he had a contract
with blumenberg to purchase the hos
pital. After relating in detail what he did
at the hospital, he said:
I had my office with Blumenberg for over a
year. In consideration of my doing some legal
business for him, he gave me office rent free.
I also got for him a number of shares In the
hospital sold some real estate for him, but
did not 'do any Police Court business for him
or his friends. I thought I saw a good chance
to make money out here in this hospital and
spoke to Blumenberg about it. He had an
equity in it of about $7000 and so I offered to
purchase It if I could get it on easy terms.
We decided that I should pay ?500 a year and
interest on the balance-. I organized a new
company and took charge. I am the manager
now and the principal owner.
During Murdock'a examination it de
veloped that a bill of drugs ordered by
Dr Frizell from Langley & Michaels was
ordered returned by Blumenberg, who
said: "There are too many medicines in
the hospital now." Murdock claimed that
Blumenberg had only guaranteed his
credit of ?70 at the wholesale drug house
and the drugs sent back ran the bill up in
excess of the amount named.
After the hospital cook and some of the
attendants had testified to the good
quality and sufficient quantity of the rood,
Dr Hatch announced that he would ren
der his decision as to the revocation of
the license on Monday morning at 11
I o'clock.

HIGHBINDERS
KILL LOOKOUT
Fire Two Shots at Chin
Chew Through a
Window.
Blackmail Follows Loss in
Gambling Den and
Causes Crime.
Chin Chew, a lookout at Buck Guy's
gambling house, 820 Washington street,
was murdered while sitting at his win- j
dow adjoining the entrance to the den
early yesterday morning by two high
binders, who have so far eluded the vigi
lance of the police. Two snots were fired
at the lookout, the flrst bullet strik
ing him in the abdomen, the second lodg
ing in the wall behind him.
About ten minutes to 4 o'clock the mur
derers approached the window at which
Chin Chew was seated. The window is
covered with a wire screen. One of the
highbinders placed the muzzle of a re
volver between the wire screen and the
glass and fired twice. They were seen to
run away by three Chinese, who were un
able to get a good look at their features.
The police were quickly notified and De
tectives Dinan and Bailey, Sergeant Chris
tiansen and Policeman. Peshon were soon
at the scene. They sent Chin Chew to the
Receiving Hospital, but he died a few
minutes after arriving there. The officers
made a thorough search, but could find no
trace of the murderers.
Detective Ed Gibson was detailed on the
case yesterday, and he ascertained that
the murder was due to an attempt at
blackmail following a loss at the gam
bling tables. Three highbinders had played
successful!'- about two weeks ago, win
ning about $1700. Buck Guy came to the
conclusion that they had cheated him and
he told his assistants to be on their guard
when they returned. They did so a week
ago last Monday night and they lost $350,
the assistants playing the same trick on
them that they had worked before on the
house. Since then they had threatened to
kill Buck Guy unless the $350 was re
turned to them, and failing in that it is
supposed they determined to wreak their
vengeance on the lookout. Gibson wants
Buck Guy to swear to warrants for the
arrest of the men he suspects, but is
doubtful that he will do so, being afraid
they will take his life.
About 10 o'clock Thursday night Police
man Tillman of the Chinatown squad saw
a man acting suspiciously in front of the
gambling house. The man had a paper
parcel under his arm, and when Tillman
grabbed hold of him and opened the par
cel he discovered it contained a large
Colt'B revolver. It is believed that he was
there to murder some one. He was ar
rested for carrying a concealed weapon,
and was taken before Judge Mogan yes
terday. The case was continued till No
vember 4. He -aye the name of Chin
Moon, and said he was a cousin of Chin
Chew. After he had been informed of
Chin Chew's murder he said he had come
from Bartlett Springs to protect the dead
man, as he had been notified that threats
had been made to kill him. The police do
not believe nis story.

Silk=Beaver Hats
m&L * rf^t^ Marked n0w ,Â§2.520.
**** JfW J Don't know where else you
'^fef^S^ can get them in the city under
I -TJft?- "%, 1 $3.75.
So scarce they're hard to find even at any price.
The rarest and most acceptable offer we can make in
millinery just now. For they are the hats you are air crazy
for. Our New York aids snapped up a few dozen much un-
der their worth and hurried them to us as fast as the express
could bring them. The brims are wide and quite stiff, and,
with the crown, are completely covered with long, silky
beaver. Black and colors now one price, $2.25. A dollar more
# trimmed â $3.25.
New York sends us Â¦ -
Sbme More New Veilings.
But we mark them at the same old prices. We have been getting more
than our share of the veiling business this fall, but that's what we started in

flated price.
Two prices to show you what we mean: . , _
AT 25Â«Â»â Gray mixed complexion veilings, in open and closed meshes: plain ana
dotted all-silk meshes; also white chiffon, or white velvet dots on black.
AT ?>Ocâ Fancy. Tuxedo meshes; plain and with silk chenille and self dots in
black; London meshes with clusters of three small dots; gray mixed Tuxedo
and London meshes plain and dotted: also gray mixed with clusters of black
dots, and white chiffon with black embroidered dots, and black: with white
dots. Then there are the new dotted chiffon veilings, quite \ogui3h now.

Another Big Time
In Flannelette Wrappers.
The values are strong; the wrappers are good; the prices are

more satisfactory house dresses anywhere than these. It's that
fact that has been bringing so many more women to us for
their wrappers this fall.

permanent arrangement.
