UFFALO, N. T., Sept. 21-Every
Indication to-night regarding the
trial of Leon Czolgosz, which
â *~-~ - will open to-morrow morning, is
that it will not be delayed by
technicalities or long examination of wit
nesses, and that President McKinley's
slayer will reir.al|i a living disgrace to
humanity only so long as is absolutely
necessary to meet the requirements of the
law. It remains with Dr. Carlos F. Mac-
Donald of New York and Dr. Arthur W.
Hurd, medical superintendent of the Buf
falo State Hospital, to determine whether
a defense will be made for Czolgosz. If
as a result of their examination of the
prisoner they decline to pronounce
him of unsound mind the attorneys for
the assassin will interpose little or no
/,o2ection to the talesmen, make short
cross-examinations and rest the case
without calling a witness. It was said to
night the alienists would pronounce Czol
cosz of sound mind.
Unless experts can be found to declare
Czolgosz insane his way to the electric
chair will not be obstructed by legal tech
nicalities.
No Defense Is Likely.
Judge Lewis, one of Czolgosz's counsel,
cald to-night:
"You can easily see for yourself that
the mental condition of Czolgosz offers
the only opportunity for a defense. There
is no question as to the fact of the as
sassination. The people will establish
that and we shall not attempt to disprove
it, as It would be sheer folly to attempt
to do so."
"In the event of experts being unable
to arrive at the conclusion that Czolgosz
is Insane, what then?"
"Nothing. If the man is of sound mind
â¢we have no defense and there will be
none,"
Carleton E. Ladd, associate counsel,
eaid something might turn up, but he did
not think it probable. Mr. Ladd repeated
that the only defense would relate to the
Rental condition of Czolgosz.
Mr. Ladd said that Czolgosz would not
talk with counsel.
The assassin refused to discuss the case
(when approached by his attorney.

Although great secrecy was maintained
at the District Attorney's office, it was
learned to-day that Dr. Allen McLane
Hamilton, one of the most noted alien
lets in the country, w-ho was an expert
Â¦witness at the Guiteau trial, is in Buffalo.
JCo doubt as to Czolgosz's sanity exists in
tho mind of District Attorney Penney,
bo it is presumed that Dr. Hamilton is
here merely to meet the question of In
sanity ehould the defense make any fight
on that ground. The District Attorney is
already fortified with tho opinion of Dr.
Joseph Fowler, Dr. Putman and Dr.
Floyd S. Crego, Buffalo alienists of stand
ing, that Czolgosz is perfectly sane.
Czolgcsz's trial will begin at 10 o'clock

GALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET.
N. W... WASHINGTON, Sept. 22.â
In the preliminary skirmishes in
the great naval battle between the
opponents and adherents of Rear
Admiral Schley the advantage has dis
tinctively been with the defense, Judgs
â¢ Advocate, Lemly In his dual capacity as
judge of the proceedings and Navy De
partment advocate' having so far notably
failed .to bring to light any of the start
ling revelations whlc. had been, so often
hinted'at and so glibly promised.
There is every reason to believe that
Rear Admiral Sampson will not be
brought into the case at all If Rear Ad
miral Schlcy's lavvyeis can prevent it, and
the charge of "caitiff" conduct formu
lated by Mr. Maclay against Rear Ad
miral Schley will not be preyed by the
Navy Department's representative. The
main point of attack upon the rear ad
miral will be along the line of'"repre
hensible conduct" and inefficiency while
acting as commander in chief of the fly
ing squadron. â¢ .
Few. Condemning Facts.
For an pfflcer brought to task on the
serious allegations embodied in the ten
precepts framed by the Navy Department
Rear Admiralachley has so far shown up
exceedingly well. Many . opinions have
[ been shown," but few/condemning facts
against the, "applicant" have yet come to
light. The most damaging testimony so
far is in connection with the bombardment
of the Colon, Rear Admiral Higginson,
Commander Schroeder and others having
flatly" sworn that every, effort Incumbent
upon- the commander in chief to destroy
that vessel was not made. _. The testimony
going to show that the rear admiral's
blockade of Santiago was Ineffective and
the statement of Commander Schroeder
that the flying squadron did not proceed
with . all dispatch ; when ordered j to hurry
from Clenfuegos to Santiago are .two oth
er points of importance which have been
scored. â¢ ; ,.
/Â¦"The course pursued by'thte judge advo
cate in his investigation shows plainly
that special stress is to be . laid on the
question of coal^supply, the facilities for
coaling south of Cuba and the weather
prevailing during that period in which
Admiral Schley was representing to the
department his difficulties over this coal
question.
. When witnesses yesterday were trying
to tax their memory regarding the exact
amount of coal on board at specific times
Admiral Dewey curtly interrupted to say
that the log books would give that in
formation. The Call here publishes ex
tracts from the log of the Merrimac show
ing t,hat air of- the vessels of the squad
ron were replenished with coal from May
22 to May 29. This log flatly contradicts
Schley's representations to the depart
ment.
Surprise for Schley's Counsel.
From a trustworthy source it is stated
that the publication of extracts from the
Merrimac's log will. come as a revelation
to Rear Admiral ScWiey'a counsel; that
the existence of this now highly important
document' had been overlooked by them
and forgotten as completely as the Merri
mac herselfâ the vessel which was sunk
by Hobson In.' the. entrance . to â¢ Santiago
harbor.' Here are extracts from Rear Ad
miral Schley's official correspondence on
"They talked violence all. the time, and
I was glad when they went out of tho
neighborhood. Almost every night there
was a crowd from the city at their house.
They used to come out to the farm from
the electric road, so that we could not

"The two boysâ the one that shot the
President and Waldeckâ used to come to
my house and talk to me aoout their so
cialist papers. They brought their papers
to me and tried to get me to read thenr!
Once when they were here during the
last Presidential campaign they got to
talking about President McKinley, and
one of them, said: *
Detective Schmunk to-day learned from
neighboring farmers that the Czolgosz
boys, Leonard and Waldeck, have been
readers of socialist papers for several
years. John D. Knox, an aged farmer
who lives in the vicinity of the former
Czolzosz farm, said to-day:
The fact^ttiat Czolgosz had money im
pelled the detectives to try' to learn
whence he got it. To-day his brother,
Waldeck, confessed to having sent it to
Leon under the name of Frank Snyder.
at West Senaca, N. Y.
From the first the Buffalo police and
the secret agents of the Federal Govern
ment have been strong in their belief that
there was a plot. One of the strong
elements in their belief has been the
fact that the handkerchief by which the
assassin concealed the hand in which he
held his weapon was a woman's hand
kerchief. What is more important is
that the handkerchief was bound about
the "hand in a way that he, it is said,
would not have been able to tie It him
self. . " Y
CLEVELAND, -Sept. 22.âInvestiga
tions made, to-day by Police Detective
Smunk reveal the startling possibility
that a plot to assassinate President Mc-
Klnley was laid a year or more ago, be
fore he was elected for his second term,
and that it may have been - laid - in
Orangetown, Pa., where the Czolgosz
family lived. A remittance made to the
assassin by his brother, Waldeck Czol
gosz, about a month ago led to the in
vestigation that may have an important
bearing uf>on the case. â¢

The President's walk with General

route lay through the beautiful section of

They were gone about two hours. During
the time General Wood went over much
of the Cuban situation with the President.

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 22.-The primary
at which delegates will be selected for
local nominating conventions will be held
on Tuesday next.
It is a remarkable circumstance thatnot
even th* shrewdest "politicians can say
who will be the Republican nominee for
the office of Mayor. George H. Clark, the
incumbent, was elected on the straight
Republican ticket, bujt he has no. hopes of
a renomlnatlon at the hands of that par
ty and will run independent. Talk now
seems to center upon B. U. Steinman, a
former Mayor; William Land, also a
former Mayor, and Joseph Steffens. Land
has thus far given no Indication of a
desire to run for the office, while it is sad
thnt either Steinman or Steffens would
take the nomination. \ * Â¦ ..
It seems to be the general belief that
Steinman is the choice of Colonel J. B.
Wright, whOBe power is still an element
in local politics, although he has appar
ently been divorced entirely from the rail
road IntereatH. But no man has yet been
willing to name the winner.
John C. ing, president -of the Board of

his friends declare his chances are excel

rejoicing over the discomfiture which ap

and declare that the inability of the lead

Major General Otis, when seen to-night,
said that If the officers at Fort Sheridan
gave a ball he did not care to crttlciae
them, as it was probably only a little so

that the army regulations required the
wearing of crape on the sword hilt for
thirty days and nothing more.
ABMY OFnCERS WEAR
MOURNINO AT A BALIi
In answer to an inquiry as to whether
Buffalo could take care of the crowds
that were coming. neÂ«sald there was no
difficulty whatever in this regardâ that
Buffalo could easily take care of 25^,000
ptrangers every day comfortably, and at
a reasonable rrlce. i
He said further that the attendance at
the exposition now was remarkable when
all the circumstances surrounding the
present were taken into consideration.
From every quarter telegraphic assur
ances were being received of the purpose
of the different States ' and numberless
organisations to do everything in their
power to give expression to. the warm
general feeling of Interest and commen
dation in the great work which has been
undertaken and so successfully and mag
nificently carried out by Buffalo. All
State days and other special days Bet
heretofore for this month and postponed
on account of the sad events attending
the tragic end of the President are being
reassigned and taken up by the different
States and localities interested with in
creased Interest and a purpose on the
part of every one to make them more
brilliant and splendid In every way than
would have been the case had they been
carried out as originally intended. He
added that the only problem now con
fronting the exposition was how to find
days enough within the closing weeks to
adequately take care of the many at
tractions and features now being planned.
He predicts a great attendance during
the month of October and one In excess
of the highest estimates that have 'been
made by the most sanguine.
"This one feature of the exposition,"
said the director general, "has attracted
greater comment from the millions who
have visited it than has been the case
heretofore with Latin-American exhibits
at any previous one."
Referring to President Mllburn's state
ment, Director General Buchanan said
that at no previous exposition had the
countries of South and Central America
taken as deep personal Interest in its
success as they had in this one. This
was especially true of Chile, which had
expended upon a building and an exhibit
a half million dollars, and. equally so of
Cuba, which for the first time In her
history stood independent in a great ex
poslfion within a magnificent building of
her own filled with her natural resources
and productions.
South America's Fine Showing.
"There are six weeks more of the life
of the exposition and it is in the full
bloom of its beauty and Interest. Every
feature of it has been developed to its
highest point and it is being operated in
a more elaborate scale "than ever. It Is
a complete mass of varied activities and
entertainments, more than adequately
carrying out its alms and purposes. It Is
a national enterprise and should be sup
ported $s such for the credit of our coun
try as the leading nation of this hemi
sphere. That support I feel certain it
will have In fullest and overflowing meas
ure."
"The position in whicn the tragedy found
me gave me the opportunity to Know what
was in that great soul during the hours
Just before the execrable shot. The Pres
ident had taken the deepest interest in
the exposition from the start. Its ideal
and conception are in harmony with his
wise and beneficent public policy. The
years that have been - spent in the evolu-
Iion and development Â«f the idea of the
essential interdependence of the nations
of the hemisphere, which was called the
Pan-American idea, have their full ex
pression in this exposition. It gave the
opportunity which he eulogized in that
great speech which has already passed
into history as the highest note of Amer
ican statesmanship and the most perfect
expression of the Pan-American idea. The
way in which the idea had been developed
here and the glorious setting which art
and industry had- given it gratified and
even surprised the President. He was
deeply impressed by the beauty and mag
nitude of the exposition, the wonderful
display of electrical illumination and the
evidence on every side of tho hearty co
operation of the Governments and peo
ples of the North, South and Central
Americas in making it truly Pan-Ameri
can. He told me that above everything
he wished that he could have had time
nnd opportunity for an extensive and un
interrupted Inspection of the grounds, the
buildings and the exhibits. 1 know that
had he been spared to conclude his visit
he intended to commend the exposition,
in his powerful and convincing way, to
the support of the public.
McKinley Deeply Interested.
Whin In his memorable address tho
President emphAsUvd tho Pun-Amcrlcan
idea und made it part of history tho peo
ple of JJullnlo realized that their efforts
were appreciated. They scorned contented
mill proud that us Individuals of one city
they had done tho work which might well
tia\e been the nation's undertaking. The
revulsion was terrible, und now that it
has passed the question of what is to
come is Interesting. Tho public fooling Is
strong, nnd all ono way. livery one seems
to realize that thu stockholders of the ex
position have met u great lossâ probably
of not less than Il.0o0.iwo. Thut pructlcal
ly means the citizens, for about every
liufl'ulonlan has Htuck in the exposition.
The dollars and cents seem to huve been
thoroughly eliminated from the calcu.a
tlon now. but the work to be done and
the end to be achieved seem foremost In
every man's mind. They feel now that
the exposition must be carried to a lln
ish. President Milhurn put his thought
very strongly. He said:
"There must be no faltering in our ef
forts now, considering how much the suc
cess of the Pan-American Exposition
means in the development'of closer polit
ical relations between the peoples of the
Western Hemisphere. That was a policy
earnestly, favored by President McKinley
and which interested him so deeply in the
exposition from its first inception. It is
a Etrange stroke of fate that the success
of tiÂ«e exposition should be threatened
through this fearful tragedy. We should
be lacking in loyalty to his memory if we
did not bend all our energies to crowning
the work which he had so close to his
heart. . .; ' Â¦ ' :

BUFFALO, Sept. 22.â This city is pull
!ne itself together after a fortnight of In
activity and sorrow such as It had never
before known. .What was Intended to bo
the gala period of its history was turned
into unspeakable grief, which has gone
into every home with a force hard for any
one here to realize. Buffalo was' full of
personal loyalty and enthusiasm for Pres
ident McKlnley. It has been a centor of
McKJnley sentiment all through his public
career, nnd there was no city in the coun
try whoro friendship and devotion for him
was more marked. Naturally his tragic
end while its guest depressed the city be
yond expression.
There novcr wna a community more en
grossed In a great undertaking than Unf
falo was with the Pan-American Exhibi
tion threo weeks ago. Every man, woman
und child in the city had a direct Interest
and pride in tho undertaking. It vcomed
that every ono with whom a \MtrHnirer
spoke had in mind the larKH Ideal of the
Ki-i-iu good which tho domonntrntlon of
ilio wonderful resources und abilities uf
tho WeHtorn Hemisphere was to oo for
the country. Hurtnlo people ueomed rather
proud that thu whole expttnao of tho dem
onstration hod fallen upon them and thotr
fellow citiscnii. They would cull attention
to tho fuel that all of tha funds had boon
mined In liufiulo without assistants from
the nation, thu 8tato or even tho city

BEADS MISS FERGUSON'S POEM.
It Is natural to demand the extermination of
anarchists, but it is not bo easy tÂ» accomplish
It. These mad dogs of society will continue
to appear as they have appeared for many
years, in eplte of stringent laws and ceaseless
vigilance. The evil must be remedied at Its
roots. The anarchist holds life cheap; he scoffs
at religionâ the kingdom of God is the antithe
sis of anarchism. Christ in the heart Is the
radical and permanent cure; it is the effective
preventive of anarchism. The foundation
truths of trust In God as voiced in the dying
words of McKinley â these are the hope of our
republic and the surety of Its destiny. Not our
courageous soldiery, not our navies floating
majestically on every sea. not our inexhausti
ble mines, not our countless acres, teaming
with abundant harvests ; not the/ hum of ma
chinery, not schools and universities and li
braries, but the teachings and sanctions of re
ligion make the most efficient force for the
battles of progress and the victories of peace.
The ethical fiber Of the people Is the factor of
the largest moment.
The aÂ«nasrlnatlon of President McKln'iey
brings us fare to face with an urgent and pres
ent duty. We r/iust meet and emphatically
settle the status and doom of anarchy and, an
arciilstr on American soil. Traitors are lnlour
midst and we must treat them In the only way
that there is for treating traitors. We must
do this, not as a mob,' but by due process of
law. If we have not sufficient law covering
the case of anart-hy, we must make sufficient
laws.. We must not wait until it becomes an
overt act. The execution of all the anarchlstb
In the world wculd not be a. redress for Wil
liam McKlnley's life.
The Rev. E. Nelander preached on the
subject "The Cure for Anarchy" at the
Kirst KnRllch Lutheran Church yesterday

flattered ourselves that our free Government
could not be the object of its hatred. Now we
see that It Is aa bitter against the ' freest as
against the most despotic Government Tho
assassination of our President roused the na
tions as that of no King, Emperor or Czar
could have done. The shot fired in. the Pan
American Fair was fired in the presence of th
nations there and has touched all nations more
closely - than otherwise could have been pos
sible. The effect will be to promote Interna
tional co-operation against anarchism. The act
has caused many who were unconsciously drift-
Ing toward anarchism in thought and feeling
to : halt and more carefully examine the lines
of their thinking. ' Â¦
One great and clear truth coming out of all

CUBE FOR ANASCHY.
I am not one to advocate stern
measures in avenging the death of
our beloved President. I prefer that
the law take its course, but red
anarchy must be stamped out at auy '
cost. Too long has this monster gone
unrestrained, hiding its foul purpose
behind the mask of free speech. I
think all men who by voice of mouth,
or by pencil or pen, encouraged in
any way the assassination of rulers
are guilty of a crime worse than mur
der, for they stab at the' heart of the
nation itself and should be put to
death. What shall be said of those
who by pencil and pen have held the
President up to contumely and scorn,
exciting hatred in the hearts of the
depraved and murder in the souls of
tiie wicked? Too long have we been
amicted with the loathsome disease
of yellow journalism, poisoning the
minds of our children and breeding
crime in the heart's of the people.
The time has come when the discus
sion of public questions by a free
press should be limited â when it
shall no longer be permitted to de
fame innocent public men without
cr.use. The press shell be free under
the constitution, but it shall no
longer be privileged to wreck human
lives, nor spit its venom upon unof
fending men, nor continue to light
the torch of anarchy without punish
ment. The time has come for us to
notify the world that the United
States shall no longer be the dump
ing ground for the scum of the
earth.

was ready and willing to die for the preserva
tion of the Union, which he deeply loved. His
wildest imagination could never have pictured
to him the glories of his career. Beginning as
an attorney he went to Congress and thence to
the Governors chairâ the stepping-stone to the
Presidency. In public life he was always a
shining example of incorruptible statesman
ship. And it was this man, this patriot, who
fell a victim to the foulest deed in the annals
of crime. It had not even the excuse of Judas;
but he fell because he was great, because he
was noble, because he was lÂ»eloved. He fell
a victim to that blot upon civilizationâ red an
archy.

from the Pythian ritual. The dead Pres

Light," was rendered by the Knicker
bocker quartet, and at its conclusion Past
Grand Chancellor Carl E. Lindsay deliv
ered the oration. He said in part:
Only a few- months ago this city presented a
*Jectacle which will live long in the heart of
every citizen. At that time there appeared in
our midfst a iran who held the highest fetation
within --the gift of his fellow men, the leader
and idol of SO.OCO.OO'i of freemen. He walked

of a devoted people, with no >ear of treachery
In hie heart. I-*t us be thankful that here in
our great State no '.grnoble wretch ajslded who
dared to raise hi.- hand against that sj.otless
man. William McKinley.
We who are assembled here to-day mourn
in a double senFe. We as citizens deplore the
untimely end of our chief executive, and as
Knighte of Pythias we mourn the death of a
dear brother. In early life he had learned the
etory of Damon pnd Pythias and that knowl
edge had its infiuence In shaping his mind and
developing thoee characteristics which ren

Glory of a Uoble. Example.
The service began with a voluntary on
the organ by A. O. Ecknsan, followed by
the singing of a pathetic air, "Gathering
Homeward from Every Land." by the
Knickerbocker quartet. Past Grand Chan
cellor H. R. Arndt read from the memo
rial service of the order. He was fol
lowed by Frank McGowan. with brief re
markF. in which he alluded to the ad
mirable trait? of McKlnley as a man and
brother and referred to the meeting as a
testimonial to the greatness of America's
beloved son and leader.
The hall wai handsomely draped for the
occasion with streamers of black with
white borders that covered the organ, side
walls and balcony rail. Crossed flags
suitably draped vere bestowed at inter
vals upon the streamers, while beneath
hung life-size portraits of the martyr
President. The platform was well-nigh
hidden by palms and ferns, while on the
left stood a magnificent floral piece rep
resenting the national flag and bearing the
words "Our Brother and Our Chief." Over
the console hung the late President's por
trait, surrounded by draped flags and
wreaths.
THE Knights of Pythias of San
Francisco held highly impressive
memorial service? at Metropolitan
Temple yesterday afternoon in
honor of their dead brother and
chief, the late President William McKin
ley. The seating capacity of the auditori
um was taxed to its utmost by an audi
ence of men and women numbering among
then* the best-known people of the city.
The service was beautiful and solemn and
attested to the full the high estimation in
which the stricken executive of the land
was held by a devoted people.

LONDON, Sept. 22.â The "War. Office
has received the following dis
patch from Lord Kitchener, dated
Pretoria, September 22: ',
"Kritzinger, while endeavoring
to force a passage of the Orange River
near Herschel at 1 o'clock on Friday
morning, rushed the camp of a party of
Lovatfs scouts. He failed to cross the
river, but the scouts lost heavily. Lieu
tenant Colonel Murray and Captain Mur
ray, his adjutant, were killed. I deeply
regret the loss of Colonel Murray, who
throughout the war had led Lovatt s
scouts with great gallantry.
"Under cover of darkness the Boers
managed to carry off a gun. They were
promptly followed up. and, the gun was
recovered in a smart engagement, In
which Kritzinger lost two killed and
twenty taken prisoners." \ * \.x.
Lord -Kitchener also reports that the
British captured by the Boers in the am
bush near Scheepers Nek on September
17 have been released and that the British
casualties in the recent Vlakf ontein . en
gagement, when the Boers captured a
company of mounted Infantry â¢ and two
guns, were one officer and five men killed,
twenty-three men wounded and six offi
cers and 109 men taken prisoners. He an
nounced that these prisoners have since
been released. .
They are on both the coast lines and within)
forty miles of Cape Town. Even the lntelli-*
geifte department does not know how many
Colonial rebels have taken up arms In the last
fortnight.
The town guard of Cape Town has been or
dered to hand in the magazine rifles and am
munition, ostensibly because these are wanted
at the front. Martini-Henry's have beea
served out instead.
In conclusion the writer declares that
the Dutch element in the colony is in re*
volt, and it is useless to disguise the fact,
In Boer circles in Holland it is asserted
that everything is prepared for a Dutch
rising in both Cape Colony and Natal.
A most alarmist letter from Cape Town
is published to-day by the Daily Express.
The writer says:
The Boers are overrunning Cape Colony.
Dutch Rising Threatens.
Lord Kitchener's latest dispatches, al
though they contain good news as well as
bad, have done little to reassure the pub
lic concerning the state of affairs. The
loss of Lieutenant Colonel Murray, a
brother of Lord Mansfield, is keenly felt.
There is little doubt that further details
will show that it was a serious affair.
Kitchener announces that the Buffalo
River is flooded and that there is no
change in the situation in Natal. The
latter fact shows that General Lyttlelon
has not yet succeeded In interfering with
the movements of Commandant General
Botha. P. J. Botha, whose capture Ldrd
Kitchener reports, is a brother of Â¦ the
Boer commandant. According to the lat
est advices from Cape Colony the situa
tion there is serious owing to sympathy
and aid which the -Dutch are giving the
Boer commandos. The British find it dif
ficult to obtain news of Boer movements.
General French's task is described as the
hardest allotted him during the whole
war.
At Pretoria the. strength of the Boars
in the field is now estimated at 11.000. If
these figures be correct the Boers must
be constantly gaining recruits. Their sup
ply of arms and ammunition seems to be
inexhaustible. - â¢
Is In no -way regarded as an Indication of
the intention on the part of the Russian
Emperor to interfere in South African af
fairs. Even in Paris reflection seemed to
haVe convinced many papers that there
was little In the words of President Lou
bet, and that beyond a confirmation of the
Franco-Russian alliance little has been
achieved by the visit of the Russian sov
ereigns.

attained actual rank as line officers, and tho line officers are

PERSONAL MENTION.
By the operations of the United Stateg navy personnel law
of 1889 the engineer corps ceased to exist as a distinct
branch of tho navy, and its members were transferred to the
several grades in the line. One hundred and sixty-five officers
were thus- affected, of which there ' were 8 captains, 15 com
manders, 27 lieutenant commanders, 63 lieutenants, 30 junior
lieutenants and 22 ensigns. All of the first two grades and
twenty-five lieutenant commanders were to perform engineer
duty, only, while the others were required to qualify for line
duty, by examination- after March 1, 1901, and by this time all
of the latter have passed the qualifying ordeal, except one, who
has been temporarily rejected because of physical disability.
The vacancies in the engine rooms of the ships have been filled
by a corps of one hundred and fifty warrant machinists, and
only very few of the original stock of line officers have been de
tailed for engineer duty, as was the intention of the promoters
of the law. , Engineer in Chief Melville is apprehensive that the

The naval expenditures of Japan have Increased vastly dur
ing the past ten years. The ordinary expenditures for 1891 of
$2,706,000 are now $10,085,500, and the extraordinary expenditures
have risen from $2,044,500 in 1891 to $8,477,000, the totals for the
two periods being $4,750,500 and $18,562,500, an' increase of about
300 per cent
be civilians sharin? full responsibilities with the other
Cabinot officers. The scheme also provides that the chief of
the Military and Naval -Bureau shall be independent of the
Ministers in strategical questions and responsible only to the
Emperor as the chief of the staff. This reorganization will un
doubtedly result In greater efficiency, and Is following the sys
tems of Great Britain, France and the United States, where
civilian Ministers control and are held responsible for the affairs
of the navy. The training- and environments of naval officers
are not calculated to make them politicians In the broad sense,
nor are they, as a class, good business men. If naval officers
in this country were eligible for the office of Secretary of the
Navy it Is easy to foresee the disastrous results from having a
partisan in that office. There would.be soft shore berths for the
victorious contingent and waiting orders or undesirable sea
duty for the others. It is now done to a considerable extent
through hoodwinking a civilian secretary, but with a naval
officer in absolute control the unchecked rewarding of friends
and punishment of enemies would result In utter demoralization
of the service. Tha Japanese navy has suffered from this abuse
of power for some, time, and the remedy proposed will benefit
the navy and army.
THE Japanese Government has practically decided on a
scheme of naval and. army- reorganization, In which it
is provided that the Ministers of these two branches, In
stead of being necessarily officers on the active list, may

JAPAN WILL REORGANIZE ITS NAVY DEPARTMENT
ON LINES NOW IN VOGUE IN OTHER COUNTRIES
Late reports on-the subject from Washington are
altogether favorable. The Senators who were
opposed to the first treaty have been consulted in the
formation of the one now under consideration and
there is every reason to believe a majority, if not
all of them, are satisfied. The treaty itself, it appears,
has not yet been framed. Nothing has been done
further than to settle the points' in dispute. The
formal document will not be drawn up .until Lord
Pauncefote returns to this country next month.Y That
will give ample time for President Roosevelt to "shape
it in accord with his views of what is best for the"
country. Thus the long negotiations preliminary to
the undertaking are about to end. Our Washington
dispatches say: "All signs now point to the accept
ance of the treaty by the Senate. President Roose
velt will do everything in his power to bring about
this result." ....
The news will be thoroughly gratifying to the
American people. The construction of the canal has
been long desired-. In Congress after Congress efforts
to provide for the work have been made and .at many
times success has seemed to be in sight. At each
promising juncture, however, something interfered
and a new delay took place. President McKinley was
heartily in favor of the enterprise. His treaty with
Great Britain, arranged for the purpose of enabling
an immediate undertaking of it, was rejected by the
Senate. A new treaty has been under consideration
all summer and will be ready for submission when
Congress -meets. The retirement' of Secretary Hay
would doubtless have entailed the making of another
treaty and consequently a further delay in the work.
Is is therefore gratifying to learn that there has never
been any danger of that kind. â¢"â¢
The emphatic declaration made by the President
just before taking the oath of office that he would
carry out President McKinley's policy in its entirety
did not completely dissipate the fears that existed in
some quarters at the capital, for reports came from
that point to the effect- that it was believed Hay
would soon retire from the office of Secretary of
State and that a new Secretary more in accord with
President' Roosevelt on the canal controversy would
take his place. Even the last lingering fear of that
kind seems now to have been dissipated. Secretary
Hay is to retain his place, and the special correspon
dent of The Call has been authorized to say: "The
State Department is greatly encouraged to believe
that it will be able to make a treaty embodying all
the ideas agreed to by the Senate and at the same
time satisfactory to the President and to Great
Britain."
FROM the moment that President Roosevelt
took the oath of oflice the press correspon
dents at the capital became more interested in
the eourse he would pursue in relation ' to the
isthmian canal treaty than in any other single feature
of hit policy. In their reports they have Kiven.& Rood
deal of space not only to the President's words on
the subject, but to rumors and gosyip concerning his
attitude toward it. It is hardly to be doubted that
in giving such prominence to that phase of the
change in the Presidency the correspondents have
reflected the tone of official sentiment in Washington.
The treaty is evidently regarded as the most import
ant work now in the hands of the administration, and
there has been great eagerness to know whether the
new- President would support it or not.
THE CANAL TREATY.
Here in San Francisco business is good, but it
would be much better were it not for the strike,
which is hampering the delivery of country produce
and cutting down the demand for it, which all comes
back upon the farmer in due time. For instance, the
commission merchants on the Hay Exchange report
an unusual number of orders for export and domestic'
consumption, which cannot be filled, as the goods
cannot be delivered in sufficient quantities, and the
dealers in oats say that owing to- this same strike
the consumption of oats in San Francisco ii less
than one-third of the normal at this time of the year.
These hindrances, of course, affect prices, and they
are but two out of an extended list which might be
cited. The hay men say that business would be
better by 25 per cent than ever before were it not
for the strike, whereas it is now less than usual. And
so on down a long list. Still, in spite of these draw
backs, the trade of the city, is making a good showing,
and, excepting in regard to the strike, the merchants
are not complaining.
The money market is beginning to exert an un
favorable influence in Wall street, as it is quite .apt
to do at this time of the year. The withdrawals of
currency from Xevv York to move the Western crops
have been larger than expected, which tends to
render operators wary, though this may be more or
less offset by imports of gold from Europe already
under way. Of co-rse, this westward flow will soon
turn eastward again, so the deficiency will be merely
temporary.
The other great staples are firm as a rule. Wool
has been strengthened by higher prices realized at
the recent London auction sale, and woolen goods
are firm in sympathy, though the market is .quiet.
The boot and shoe trade continues in good con
dition. Boots have been advanced and prospective
large orders' for distant delivery have caused an
improvement in the price of leather. Cotton alone
h inclined to halt and is irregular. In farm products
the feature of the week was the series of heavy frosts
in the corn belt, which did a good deal of damage
to the late grain, especially in Nebraska.
The best feature of the week was the practical
termination of the steel strike, which enabled some
50,000 skilled workmen to resume their vocations
ind started up a number of large plants which have
been lying idle or worrying along with small forces.
These improved conditions, however, were secondary
to the removal of th- cloud which has been hanging'
over this great industry, curtailing production, un
settling values and disturbing quotations in Wall
street. Now that the mills have resumed the industry
shows immediate improvement. Steel rails are in
demand and steel mills are reported sold ahead well
into 1902. Pig iron is in better request, with an
advance of 25 cents per ton at Birmingham. It is
also announced that in anticipation of an expanded
business rext year some of the largest mills are to
double their capacity.
CONSIDERING that last week witnessed the
greatest funeral in the history of the modern
world, when ever seventy millions of people
buried thtir murdered Chief Magistrate, and wheir
the fxehinfje* of several other countries were closed,
out of respect, (or one day at least,. and that the
r>pirii of a ereat nation was averse to doinÂ« any
more busiuc .Â»Â» than could be helped, the week made
a brilliant hhowini* tit, far Â«Â» trade was concerned.
The country's bank clearing made a gain of
per cent over the corrciponding week in 1900, ihnutth
uho\\[ half of the most important, cities exhibited a
loss. nsmethinR which lut not been seen for several
month*. But there were only five business days in
the week, instead of the usual six. which probably
explains this falling off. The failure*, however,
decreased materially, being only 157, against an
last year.

There is blood upon it and the red evidence of murder shows through the black ink
in which the frightened, filthy and unrepentent coward begins to write its way out of the
guilty leadership which it chose to assume." It could deceive the strikers and law-break
ers; but it cannot deceive the law-abiding people of this community. They will bring
order on the fields it has reddened with crime, and will make the street, railways and fer
ries safe without its assistance. It is not an EX-convict. It is convicted and' sentenced
by public opinion and must do a felon's time for its crimes. Decent people do not need
its help. Its lawless associates, against whom it is (jetting ready to turn, will soon be ad
ministering its punishment. * 'M
In the very issue in which it threw out this first feeler, it did as it has done from
the beginning. It suppressed and sophisticated the day's news. Renas Mathesen, sole
support of an aged and helpless mother, had dared to work for wages without permission
of the Examiner's partners in infamy, the union leaders. For this reason he . was con
demned to death and was killed. At the same time died Frank McGuire. murdered by an
other gang of the Examiner's union thugs. But that paper made no mention of these
two murders that it had procured to be done. It. mutilates meYnorial addresses and sup
presses news which expose its evil and criminal influence, -but begiris : to mouth against
violence!
After more than two thousand deadly assaults have been committed, after doctors
who attend wounded non-union men have been threatened with murder, while two mur
dered non-union men were lying dead in Oakland, and law and order have been suspended
fbr weeks by the violence it has incited, the teeth of the coward chatter with fear and its
knees knock together. It is getting ready to sacrifice the" dupes it has deceived and de
luded. As it barked and blubbered at Czolgosz, it is getting ready to betray the strikers
whom it has led into crime and trouble. â¢ , >
TT â¢ , - , . .
Having . abused the police of this city for trying to protect men in. their right to
labor, and by every possible sinister and open suggestion having advised gangs of
cowardly strikers to murder non-union men, and having done all its bad best to foster law
lessness and crime, until the city streets are safe only for ruffians and murderers, and tlje
railways and ferries have become dangerous to travelers/the crocodile is getting/scared
again, and.begins to retreat. On Saturday morning it began to turn on its dupes just as
it turned on its pupil, the assassin of the President. . Having 1 counseled and advised the
murder of non-union men, it on that day announced editorially that" "brutality cannot
win a strike." Laboring through a list of lies about the police and the employers, and
announcing that it "has protested against the employment of ex-convicts' as special police
men for the purpose of provoking strife,", that paper, which engages ex-convicts on its staff
and in its business, admits that "even if the employers publicly announced their intention
to destroy unionism in San Francisco, that would not be justification for five men'beatinp
one." 5
Again, then, the thick hide of that paper has been pierced. The gorilla turns tail,
the baboon blubbers, the crocodile resorts to tears.
r*T\ HE Examiner, after inviting and suggesting the assassinatipn of the 1 President
I for months and up' to the very morning of the day that the crime was committed,
a broke out in a crocodile blubber over the accomplishment of its work. The roar
..' of rage against it that went up from every State in the Union frightened it, and
cowardice and fear, not sorrow, made it pretend a sympathy it did not feel. A. criminal
will usually furnish unconscious evidence' of guilt. The Examiner did this when it
edited but of all memorial addresses every reference to the agency of Hearst's yellow jour
nalism in the crime that good men and women were deploring.
William McKinley merits a memorial monument in
every State in the ' Union, and there are . special
reasons why such a monument would be appropriate
here. It was under his administration that the nation
began to look across the Pacific for expansion and
for commercial greatness. His name and fame will
be forever associated with -that policy which has
carried us forward in the Orient and which in the
future is to achieve so much not for ourselves only buf
for humanity itself and for the. welfare of the world..
His part," therefore, in the destiny of California has
been a large one. and the public appreciation of his
statesmanship and his patriotism will grow with the
years. It is therefore fitting" there should be a
monument'erectcd to him in this city/ If it is to be
done, however, it should be well done and' done
quickly. We should not leave the enterprise to
linger and delay so that it will come at- last as if it
had been coaxed from a reluctant people.'
SINCE n movement has been started to erect in
this city n monumental memorial to President
McKinfcy it is to be hoped the committee
lmvinÂ« the mntter in clmrge will addre^ themselves
to it with promptness nml :'erÂ«y. .The work should

memory; Time, of course, will be.rcfiuii'cd to com
plete the monument, fyr great artistic' designs are
not to be achieved in a day, but the money required
for the cost ought to be forthcoming at once.
America is rapidly becoming noted for the magnifi
cence of bcr monumental work. Our growing
artistic taste and our increasing wealth arc finding
expression in the production of 'such structures, and
we have already several. which surpass anything of a
similar kind in any part of the world. One result
of this tendency is that as soon as a great man dies
a movement is started to erect a nfonument .to him.
Most of such movements come to nothing. A con
siderable sum of money is collected, but not enougb
for the desired monument, and after much talking
and a good deal of solicitation for/subscriptions the
affair is abandoned. We must not have an instance of
that kind in the present movement.

Nearly all the landsmen who went out
on the Mohican came from the Interior, a

many of them had never seen a warship

At a meeting of the committee to-day
it was reported that of $16,000 to be
raised only $150ff was still . lacking, and
the committee decided to advance this
sum. The presentation meeting will
probably be a public affair. It will be a
joyous occasion for Santa Clara County
Odd Fellows, and Grand Master Nichols.
Grand Secretary " Shaw, r the trustees of
both the Grand Lodge and the home, and
other grand officers will be present to
share in the pleasure. -Besides a musical
programme there will be many addresses
Judge M. H. Hyland will probably make
the speech presenting the deed to Grand
Master Nichols, and the latter .will/ re
spond on behalf of the Grand Lodge.
About $30,000 will be expended at once,"
but it is expected this " sum will shortly
be doubled. There are 120 members at
Thermalito, but in Santa Clara's climate
double this number will be assured. Of
$1C,000 subscribed, the Santa Clara County
Odd Fellows themselves ' have donated
about $12.000.; ...- . . . . : . Â¦- . , ,- -

GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER
The . Rev. Dr. Kirby did not mince
words and referred to Methodist discip
line as his authority. He said summary
removal and assignment belonged to the
Bishop alone. Dr. "Evans is popular in
Stockton, being[ a man of liberal . views
and a spirited worker in all public enter
prises. As to whether the presiding
elder's statements will widen or close the
breach in the congregation remains to be
seen.- -,
This morning Dr. Evans preached his
first sermon since his return and when
he closed the Rev. Dr. .Kirby arose and
stated in effect that Dr. Evans was here
for another year; that it was the Bishop's
will; that Dr. Evans was "captain o* the
ship,'* and | that those -who were dis
satisfied might as well understand it one
time as another.
Some of the members made an active
campaign against Dr. Evans at the Pa
cific Grove Conference, but Bishop Mc-
Cabe asserted his authority and returned
the pastor. As .Dr. Evans had himself
wished for another charge the Bishop's
decision was received here with great
interest.
; STOCKTON, Sept. 22.â There was quite
a little sensation this morning: at the
First Methodist Church when the Rev.
John Kirby, the presiding elder of this
district, laid down the Methodist law to
that portion of the congregation which
so actively opposed the return of the Rev.
"W. C. Evans to the pastorship of the
church.

De Windt's chief object is to survev the
country to the nprtheast of Yakutsk, to
which point the Russian Government is
projecting a railway next year from Irk
utsk. Yakutsk will then be a junction of
the Manchurian and Siberian sections
From Yakutsk to Bering Strait, which,
with the exception of one mountain range
is all flat, will also be surveyed in view -of
a possible extension of railways. On the
American side surveyors are already
working on the northern extension of the
Klondike Railway to the American shore
of Berlin Strait. Although comparatively
narrow, the terrific currents and ice floes
preclude the possibility of a bridge con
necting the two continents, but Belgian
and American engineers have under con
sideration the construction, of a tunnel.
LONDON, Sept. 22.â Harry de "Windt.
the 'explorer, is about, to make a third at
tempt to accomplish an overland journey
via Bering Strait between Europe and
America. On the first occasion, starting,
from New York, he managed to reach
the Asiatic coast of the straits, but owing
to his capture and subsequent ill-treat
ment by Koari, the Tchuktchi chief, he
narrowly escaped with his life and had to
return. Last year he again attempted the
journey in the reverse direction, but ow
ing to the political situation in China and
on the Amur,. Count Lamsdorf refused to
allow him. to cross Siberia, and again x De
"YVindt had to relinquish the idea. Now,
however, De Windt is receiving ' assist
ance from the Russian and American au
thorities, including Commodore Melville,
in ,Washington, as a result of which he
intends to start on the journey forthwith.
Early in November George Harding,
who aecompanied De Windt on all his
previous travels, will proceed from Paris
to Yakutsk, where he will get together
dog and reindeer trains and will await De
Windt's arrival. On December 10 De
Windt' will leave Paris and travel by the
trans-Siberian railroad ' direct to the ter
minus of Irkutsk, which place will be
reached on December 20. Thence the trav
eler will proceed to Yakutsk, ~a distance
of 1300 miles, involving a three weeks'
sleigh journey. 'Arriving at Yakutsk early
in January, lie Windt will join Harding,
who will then have in readiness the para
phernalia for the long journey to Bering
Strait. A fortnight will be spent at Yak
utsk and in the third week ot January the
two travelers will proceed northeast over
an uninhabited and practically unknown
country to Nijni Kolymsk, the most re
mote northeasterly settlement of Russia
on the Arctic Ocean. This resion was
never visited except by an occasional
Siberian trader, although one portion of it
was traversed â¢ by an American traveler
when searching: for the survivors of the
Jeaniiette. . Between Yakutsk and Nijni
Kolymskâ a distance of low) milesâtrans
port will be by means of reindeer teams.
Beyond rough Government shanties,
known as povarni, erected every hundred
versts, to enable astray traveler to light
a fire, there are no habitations, and the
travelers will have to sleep in the open.
This portion of the journey, and especially
that over the Verkhoyamsk Mountains,
will be attended with considerable diffi
culty. It is expected that the settlement
of Nijni Kolymsk, which has a population
of 2000 political exiles, will be reached in
February, and there De Windt hopes to
fall in with Tenukchi fur or ivory cara
vans, returning to one of the small settle
ments on the shores of Bering Strait. It
is, of course. De Windt's intention to care
fully avoid Oumadjik,' the settlement
where he nearly lost his life, and to make
for East Cape, 120 miles to the north and
1500 miles from Nijni Kolymsk, reaching
there in the middle of April. De Windt
will then cross on' the ice to Cape Prince
of Wales, ' the most westerly point of
America, where Bering Strait is only
about the same width as the English
Channel at Dover. Should the ice con
ditions not be favorable the American
revenue- cutter Bear will, by arrangement
with the Washington Navy Department,
call for De Windt and convey him across
the strait, whence he will return either by
way of the Yukon or Mackenzie rivers to
San" Francisco, Winnipeg and New York,
which city it is hoped will be reached in
June next.
Will Attempt Overland Trip
Between Europe and
America. > .

. Reserved seat tickets will be placed on
sale at Harry Corbett's to-day. It is
expected a large crowd will go over from
this city. There la much curiosity to see
Jeffries in action and in addition It is
thought Kennedy can make a good s how
ing if he has taken sufficient exercise to
put him even in rough condition.
In addition to the main event thera will
be two ten-round contests for decisions
between Louis Long of the Reliance Club
and Kid Chlnner of San Francisco, both
fighting at 120 poundr, and between Kid
Johnson of San Joao and Arthur Oran
fleld of the San Francisco Athletic Club,
who will meet at 132 pounds.
Under this agreement Jeffries met
"Hank" Griffin in Los Angeles last week.
He failed to stop him in the stipulated
time. As Kennedy is a clever bo:cer it
will require aggressive work on the part
of Jeffries to make him stop.
When Jeffries signer for his fight: with
Ruhlin It was with tho understanding
that ho might engage in a series of four
round . contests with aspiring pugilists
who wanted the privilege of standing up
before the champion of the world. These
contests were limited to four round!) each
and Jeffries said he would meet a few
candidates for ring honors and would
endeavor to stop them In four rounds.
The second in the series of boxm.5 con
tests between James J. Jeffries, the
champion of the world, and heavy
weights of lesser importance will be de
cided at the Reliance Club, Oakland, to
morrow night. Joe Kennedy will be the
big fellow's opponent.

Veteran Cricketers Lose.
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.â Saluted by
scores of vessels as she was towed
through the East River this morning, the
Columbia, flying the pennant of the New
York Yacht Club, looked every inch the
racing craft she is.
The Columbia reached the Morst Iron
Works, Brooklyn, at noon, and at 1
o'clock was floated Into the sectional dock
astern of the steamer Old Dominion. In
two hours the yacht was blocked up In
position for her last cleaning before the
great International race. Early to-mor
row morning men will be put to work
burnishing her bronze hull. The yacht
had many visitors during the day. The
Columbia Is using the old Defender's main
boom and the mainsail with which she
won the trial races at Newport. It is not
likely that any change will be made in
either after the first race. x
It is safe to say that fully 5000 persons
visited the Shamrock II at the Erie Ba
Â«ln drydock to-dayy Sir Thomas Ltpton,
painfully limping as 1 a result of his recent
injury, looked over his challenger early in
the morning in company with Charles
Russell, David Barrie and some friends.
He then went for a sail on the Erin.
Former Commodore John G. Prague,
who possibly won more races with his
yachts in the old days than any other
owner, said after visiting the racers:
"I like the shape of the Shamrock II.
If her sails are as good as the Columbia's
she will win the. cup. Her ringing is
strong and her mast is in the right place.
Another good feature is that her boom
comes down closo to tho deck. Sho looks
bigger all over than the Columbia, and I
feel sure she Is a fast boat."

THE trap shooting season was
brought to a close yesterday at
Ingleside grounds. The members
of Olympic Gun Club smashed
blue rocks, while the Union Gun
Club men shot at live birds. The weather
conditions were perf â¢ ct and the pigeons
the best trapped this year. The atten
dance was disappointing, many of the
men who shoot repularly throughout the
season falling to appear. The opening of
tho duck and quail season a week from
to-morrow is given as a reason for the
absence of many men. They availed
of the opportunity afforded to visit their
club preserves in order that everything
might be in readiness for the first shoot
of the season.
A. J. Webb continued his fine work at
the Olympic Club shoot.- He broke his
twenty-five blue rocks without a miss.
This, taken with his other work during
the season, entitles him to first place in
the champion class. Fred Feudner fin
ished in second place. Edgrar Forster
finished first in class A, with Clarence
Haight second, Neustadter shot up sev
eral back scores yesterday, finishing first
in class B. The following 1 la the score

SAN FRANCISCO.
The German sluggers developed a phe
nomenal batting streak yesterday, both at
Oakland and Recreation Park.- The way
they hammered the ball around the lot
was a sight to behold. Dr. Moskiman
started In to do the twirling Act for the
Fashion Plates, but after five runs and
as many safe hits were made off his de
livery it was deemed -advisable to remove
him. Schmidt took his place. The new
â¢wirier fared but little better than the
doctor, for Uncle Hank's pets went after
him for seven safe ones, though brisk
fielding kept the runs down to two, mak
ing seven in all.
Meanwhile the Dudes found Krug 1 an
enigma that could not be solved, making
one lonely point and four scattering hits.
They would have .been shut out had
BrockhofC not missed Eagan' a fly In tho
sixth.
Josh Reilly started the annihilation of
the medical man by hitting the sphere
over the right field fence. His lead was
quickly, followed by Brockhoff, Pabst,
Nordyke and Krug. "When the bombard
ment was over the result was five rings
for the Dutch, with as many hits, includ
ing a home run; a triple and a pair of
doubles. In the next round by means of
two more hits and a steal by Nor
dyke two more runs were added, cinching
the game.
For Oakland Drennan opened the sixth
with a swat for two cushions. Eagan sent
one to Brockhoff, who missed It, sending
Drennan across the rubber. The cripples
were never dangerous after that. They
could not locate King's curves.
Nordyke did rome sensational batting
for the Wasps, securing four clean drives
out of five times at bat. Reilly also per
formed creditably, making three. "Kid"
Mohler lined out two of the four hits
made off Krug. Oakland did some mag
nificent fielding in the seventh, cutting off
Krug at the plate when he tried to come
in from second on Shay's fast single.
Mohler was the bright particular star la
this mixup. The score:
San Francisco 7, Oakland 1.

LONDON, Sept. 22.â Interest in Presi
dent Roosevelt's personality is unabated.
The magazines advertise articles about
him and everything he has said of Great
Britain has been dug out of his books.
Many picturesque stories of the Presi

In its issue of Wednesday, concluding a
page and a half analysis of President
Roosevelt, will say:
Renan. when\close to hU last hour, wrote
that ho would like to survive to the middle of
this century so as to know the ultimate fate
of the young Emperor of Germany, whose tu
mult was then filling and alarming the ear
of Europe. If the great philosopher had sur
vived he would probably have found a subject
of equal curiosity and uncertainty in the ac
ces&lon to the Presidency of this restless, short
muscular man. as ready with his fists as with
his pen, eoldler and litterateur, realist and
dreamer, who occupies the bleak White House
at Washington, from which are ruled eighty
of the most active, vital millions of the hu

LONDON, Sept. 22,-Attention In Lon
don financial circles last week was con
centrated upon the New York market,
which In spite of the mourning for the
late President McKlnlcy showed firmness.
Indeed, one of the features of the week
here was the rapid improvement in Atner
can railroad shares as compared with the
end of the previous week. President
Roosevelt's announcement that ho will re
tain the Cabinet of President McKlnley
has done much to stimulate the buying
of American securities in London. The
settlement of the steel strike has also
acted in a similar direction, andthe finan
cial writers take a most hopeful view of
tho American outlook. *

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 22â The diverting
of laborers secured in the Hast for ser
vice in San Francisco to this point, which
is being accomplished by labor union
agents, is not exactly agreeuble to the
general public here. The Easterners are
being Induced to stop off at Sacramento
and in consequence they are seeking ave
nues of employment here and In the
nelshborlng country which were formerly
exclusively controlled by home laborers,
many of them with families to support.
One local employment office in one day
secured work for forty colored men who
had come from the East In the hop- of
Betting work to do in 8an Francisco or
Port Costa. Others of those who have
been Induced to stop off here are declared
to have taken to begging on the streets.
While there seems to be enough work
to go around at present, it is believed that
the glutting of the labor market will re
sult In the winter months in the saddling
of hundreds of idle men on this and sur
rounding communities.

OAKLAND. Bept. 22.~ThÂ« local union
of tratmtcrs, with the consent of the City
Front Federation, has agreed to let Its
members go hack to work under the 'old
conditions, provided they be not required
to work with non-union drivers. Some cf
tho employers consented, at a conference
to-night, to this condition, and the pro
posal will be submitted to others to-mor
row.
The People's Express was not present at
the conference to-night, and what action
they will take Is not known. The Mer
chants' Express sot around the strike by
making all of Its employes stockholders
and then working them as owners. The
Merchants' Express in this way got all
the men it needs. The Teamsters' Union
refuses to recosnlze this, and thÂ« men niv
that they will not work for the Merchants'
Express until the so-called stockhoUToin
are discharged. The Austin Freight and
Transfer Company has been getting along
with non-union help, ana wero not pros
ent at the conference, to-night.
As the business of all the draylng and

Assault on Two Men.
THE problem of restoring law and
order along the water front Is by
no means settled, though the dras
tic methods adopted by the pollre
have had their effect. Between 8
o'clock Baturday evening nnd the early
hours of yesterday morning the harbor
polleÂ© made slxty-eeven arrests. Most of
thÂ« n>*n arr^uted wero union men. many
of them engaged in picket duty. ThÂ« ef
fect of this rigorous action on the part of
thÂ« pollcÂ» vu particularly noticeable at
thÂ« Harbor Hospital. Kor tho flm time
in many weeks the houra of darkness
jnrstii without the surgeon* bcinir called
upon to patch up vlctlmi <>t striker*' bru

ThÂ« water front win comparatively

day to rest. Two tmllon and a fireman

]3iitlFh Hair ontitloH him.
Shortly after the accident at Washington
and Mason streets was reported to the
Receiving Hospital, a McAllister-street
car ran into an obstruction at McAllis
ter and Leavenworth streets and gave
Its load of passengers a shaking up. A
patrol wagon was hurried to the scene,
but In answer to inquiries of the police
the conductor reported no one injured.
Subsequently, however, Fred Simmons
and T. Flaherty visited the Receiving
Hospital to have some minor Injuries
which thoy suffered in the accident
dressed. Their injuries wero slight, and
after receiving treatment they went to
their homcH.
Every effort was made to suppress all
news concerning the accident. At the
drug store, where they were taken, com
munication with the injured was, denied,
and in the lodging-house above, which
was converted into a temporary hospital,
the same rule obtained. As soon as pos
sible the injured men were removed to
their homes.
Jeffries, the gripman of car 407, which
was demolished, was badly bruised and
was sent to his home. The conductor of
this car was turning in his fares when
the accident occurred.
L. Cracker, who resides at 1215 Taylor
street, sustained a fractured kneecap and
contusions of the legs in the accident.
The fractured kneecap was set by Dr.
Bell, after which Cracker wus removed
to -his home. . .
On regaining Consciousness he said that
ho could not account.' for the. accident.
Tho rain had rendered the truck* slip
pery, but thin fact! he pointed out, was
not alone responsible for tho accident,
which ho is inclined to attribute to a de
fective grip. After he saw that the grip
man had lost control of tho car nnd thm
he could not again regain it until level
grqund was reached, Davis said tho only
thing to do was to keep trying
with tho rear brake* and await re
sult*. Â¦ When tho curs crushed to
gether, he ! was . rendered uncon
scious and remembered none of the de
tails of the excitement that followed the
collision. After his wounds w.ere dressed
Davis was removed to the Hullroad Hos
pital.
Will Davis, conductor of the runaway
car, who wns rendered unconscious In thÂ«
accident, was immediately removed to
the Receiving Tlcmpltal. His face nnd
hands, were badly bruised and injured,
and ho probably suffered internal Injuries
lie remained unconscious for some time
after reaching thn hospital.
At tho railroad office the receiver Bald
he hHd heard of an accident, but did not
think any one had been hurt. Â¦ A vromah
was said to have been among those in
jured.
A number of pAftieiiB*â¢ were nn both
cars, but .hint how many no one cttn tell.
Bomo of them, were taken to n drugstore
In the vicinity, where their wounds were
drenBod, nnd the more serlottÂ«ly Injured
were put to bed in the lo<lÂ«lnR:.houBn on
the opposite wide of the mtreet to tho
power-hoUBc. At both placed the greatest
secrecy wnÂ» mnlntnlned and the .badly
bruised passenger* wero Instructed not to
opeak nbout the matter, except to con
llrm the Htiitvnu'tit that alRht persons
were injured.
J\mt how the accident occurred In a
question. It U nfitd that GripmHn Mitch
ell lost the rope nt the corner of Jono*
and Washington streeja, and left hli car
with hook In hand and attempted to euteh
the ropo. The enr utarted down the hill,
gaining Impetus each moment. At the
corner of Mason Btreet, It eraihed Into
ear 407 that wai Btandlng on thÂ« traelt,
and carried It to the corner of Powell
street, where both Jumped the trnek. All

REN AS MATHESEN A VICTIM
TO SAVAGERY OF STRIKERS
From the Alameda Daily Argus, September 21.
I^)EK T AS MATHESEN, a resident of this city, died the day before yesterday of wounds in
1 V Hided by strikers in San. Francisco. He desired to work and needed to work, and so accepted
a position to drive a team. But a body of men, banded together to promote the' sacred cause of
labor, pitched on him in the ratio of ten to one, because he zvantcd to work when they didn't, and in
flicted such injuries that the victim died after some days of suffering. This is one of the most pitiful '
stones that we hare read of this strike. American citizens may rcid and contemplate it with zvhat
ezcr satisfaction they are able to extract.

Crape growers are anxious about the
weather. The late table grapes are Just
coloring nicely, not more than half of the
â¢wine grapes have been picked and all the
raisin grapes are either on the tray or
the vine. A rain at this time would re
eult in thousands of dollars' damage.
GrTape-Growers Fear the Bain.
The crops which have been left exposed
to the elements are all perishable. All
through the San Joaquin and Sacramento
valleys the wheat crops are still in the
fields. These crops represent millions of
dollars in value, and should the rain
reach them the farmers would lose almost
the entire profit of their year's work.
The farmers, because of the condition of
their crops, have dreaded the coming of
an early rainstorm. They have been
taking active measures to induce the
strikers to permit them to transport their
crops, but thus far without avail. It Is
thought that the rain will induce the
farmers to take more determined steps in
this direction.
The damage In this city will be nominal
In comparison to that which it is feared
the farmers will sustain should the storm
reach the Interior. of the State. Because
of the strike the farmers of the State
have not removed their crops from the
fields, as it would have been impossible
to have them transported to the city
markets. '
For this period of the season the rain
Etorm which visited this city last night
and during the early hours of the morn
ing" was the most severe that has been
experienced in this part of the State in a
number of years. Because of the sud
denness of the deftjge considerable dam
age was wrought- So abundantly and so
continually did the torrent pour down for
a. few hours that the streets were swept
as If by a cloudburst and in many
Instances were transformed Into veritable
rivers. The sewers were flushed and
overflowed at many crossings. The be
lated pedestrians, besides being drenched
to the skin, were compelled to wade
knee deep through the slush in order to
reach their homes. Particularly was this
true south of Market street. .

; This is the day of atonement for all
Jews and services will be held in all syna
gogues from sunrise to sunset. It is a
day of fasting, penitence and, prayer, l
With our hearts purified, our souls cleansed,
our natures regenerated and our sins forgiven,
we -will be. led forth from our captivity of wick
edness amid Joy and peace, and "the mountains
shall break forth into song and the trees shall
clap their hands" when we have made our
peace with God. Â» â¢
The only way' In which we can best learn
something of God's Infinite love and mercy
is by living in that part of our nature which
is unselfish, by striving to be loving and merci
ful ourselves. . The tender appeal of the
prophet, expressed in the most musical lan
guage. Is addressed to every captive of sin to
abandon his evil ways and wicked thought and
turn to his God, and thus receive mercy and
pardon. V'Â» Israelites are standing before the
throne of God on this day of expiation when
the hand of divine compassion is specially dis
posed to receive the penitent sinners If they
seek the Lord while he is to be found, and call
upon him while he is near.
The sweetest heavenly message brought by
Moses to his people, and indirectly to the
world at large, was that "God is merciful,"
a sentiment .which has been . echoed . again and
again by the great spiritual teachers of Israel,
and which has taken deep root In the con
sciousness of the Jewish race. God's mercy Is
a shoreless and unfathomable sea, as high
above our conceptions of- it, says the prophet,
."as the heavens are above the earth."
explained ',the Â¦ passionate en
treaty of the prophet to the Jewish exiles
to draw nearer to God while he was draw
ing near to them. Rabbi Myers said,^ in
part: ...
Rabbi Myers of the Bush-street Syna
gogue spoke eloquently on "The Throne
of Mercy." â¢ - ; ."
The Throne of. Mercy.
At the Geary-street Temple to-day me
morial service will begin at 11 o'clock, the
subject of the sermon being, "O Lord,
What Is Man?" The closing address will
be at 4:30 on "The Inspiration of the
Home." . "
The consoling explanation is given in the
text. "Return, come; acknowledge your en
vies, jealousies, passions, vices and. thus cleanse
your 'stubbornness and contrast your shortcom
ings with the beauty of the Ideal In character
and conduct.'* We must rely upon the loyalty
of our men when they inquire, "Watchman,
what of the night?" and the messenger an
swers, "Return, come." So must we with one
accord say with the coming morn, we' will re
turn, we will come. There ' Is vital
ity .In a religion which charms and Inter
ests. Let us be hopeful, and when the watch
man on the tower proclaims his great message,
and when the morning light breaks forth in
splendor, tften we shall have the assurance,
"Thou ehalt call, and the Lord shall answer;
thou shalt cry and God shall say, 'Here. I
am'"; then shall we return, then we shall
come.
We are exalted by the grand outburst of the
prophet's message, "Watchman, what of the
night?" and the messenger replies, "The morn
ing cometh and also the.night. if. ye will in
quire." And what are we to inquire, what to
seek? . .' " . y.S.:. Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦ / : Â¦ .- Â¦ " 'â¢ '

It lays upon us the same chastening discipline
of self-denial which, left to ourselves, we would
shun. ' . .,'â¢'-,
â¢ The week's bill at the Central is the
charming little play, "Little Lord Faunt
leroy." not seen here for many years.
This is a play to take the children to and
at which -the grown-up can also find
pleasant entertainment. The story is tak
en from Frances. Hodgson Burnett's book
of the same name and the interest cen
ter* about a small boy of quite unusual
make-upâ the little Lord Fauntleroy of the
play. It Is to be well cast and staged. .
A special souvenir matinee will be given
on Thursday next, at which all' those at
tending will- be presented with a photo
graph of Miss Florence Roberts.
This is the last week of Miss Florence
Roberts' engagement at the Alcazar Thea
ter. In response to a large demand, the
week will be given over to a revival of
"Sapho," in which the popular actress has
achieved much favor. Scenically and also
so far as' costumes are- concerned,
"Sapho" is most satisfactory, and Its.re
vival will be on a more , elaborate scale
than the original production of the sea
son. Next week the new stock principals
will make their appearance, including
Miss Alberta Converse, Mrs. M. L. Alsop,
George Tracey and Miss Carrie Lamont.
The first production will be "Liberty
lHall.". Â¦ ' ...Â¦Â¦Â¦
Thomas Q. Seabrooke, appearing In
Sydney Rosenfeld's comedy success "A
Modern Crusoe," will continue as the at
traction at the Columbia- Theater
throughout this week, the second and
final of the engagement. Next Monday
night the^ success of three continents,
"Florodora," will be the attractive offer
ing at the Columbia Theater.- A big-or
ganization is being sent by special train
across -the continent for the engagement
in this city. Over 100 people will take part
in the production.' The advance sale of
seats-.1s Â¦ announced to open Thursday
morning..
The ' Grand Opera . House interest
switches from the historictd romance of
"Richelieu"- last week to the : psychologi
cal drama of this week, "Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde." It is .a profoundly, interest
ing study, and the double role in the
hands of Mr.. Joseph Haworth should
prove an absorbing performance. It was
a favorite part of Richard Mansfield and
was a most uncanny and thrilling per
formance. In his' hands.
The Tivoli has a bill of strong interest
this week in the popular "Carmen," to be
played - Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday
nights and Saturday matinee, and "Na
bucco" as alternating programme. "Na
bucco" Is a., distinct novelty, and the name
part, in which Salassa appears. Is one of
the biggest barytone parts among. the
operas. Salassa is said to be, and it may
well be believed, the finest Nabucco in
Italy, and he will certainly be splendidly
worth hearing. The cast is an excellent
one. Barbareschi, .who has lately been
winning laurels for herself as Marguerite
and Norma, will assume the roll of Abi
gaille, the pretended daughter of Ne
buchadnezzar, and Pollettinl will be heard
as his real daughter. Dado has the part
of ; the high priest Zaccarla, and Napo
leonl Is the high priest of Baal.
"Ah altogether amusing, mystifying and
clever performance is the work of the
Svengali trio, the star entertainers in the
Orpheum's excellent bill of the week. The
amiable wizard of the troupe, Svengali I,
in a delicious Dutch dialect that at once
wins the house, explains that Svengali II,
an impersonator, and Svengali III.' a pian
ist, who turn their hypnotic backs to the
audience, will on receipt of the necessary
suggestion from the wizard at once pro
ceed to impersonate any famous person
or. play any well-known tune that is asked
for. The wizard then comes down into
,the auditorium and with his back to the
other Svengalis takes the, whispered sug
gestions of people interested as to whr.t
famous personage or well-known piece of
music, is desired. He then with a little
effective hocus-pocus "transmits" the sug
gestion to the others and in a moment the
impersonating Svengali presents Roose
velt or the lady Svengali sings "When
Other Lips." Everything asked for was
done, and the pianist's repertoire included
last night such things as the "Jewel
Song," "Dixie," "Ah Che la Morte," "To
reador's Song" and so on. The imper
sonator was asked for portraits of every
body, from Lincoln to Roosevelt, for" Li
Hung Chang, Dewey, Edward VII, Kitch
ener (who was hissed), Bismarck and
Schley, and gave roughly effective pict
ures of them all. The crowning act was
the impersonation of famous local lights.
Chief Lees, George Gresn and Joe Walcott
being first favorites with the house. But
the hypnotist chose a well-known gentle
man in the audience, , fixed him with a.
glassy eye and then "transmitted" a more
or less elaborate caricature of his hand
some physiognomy to the audience' by
means of "the Impersonator on . the ' plat.
form. Of course, it Is a> fake, but it is a
very clever and amusing one. v r â¢
Press Eldridge is another headhner- of
the. bill and an unctuous entertainer. He
has a way with him, a rich, fat laugh and
a voice that fits his happy humor. He
has the quite unusual vaudeville faculty
of writing good / songs, and has
a timely ditty ' of Sampson Â¦ and
Schley. The Parros brothers do some
extraordinary acrobatic feats. Stella Lee
dances again to every one's delight, Mr.
and Mrs.-. Karsy repeat their extraordin
ary musical act, the Misses Delmore give
again their charming picture show "The
Bridegroom's Reverie," Dorothy Morton is
on again and Marsh and Sartella com
plete the good bill.
'Hoyt's popular farce comedy "A Texas
Steer" is being played at the California
to good houses. Both Saturday night and
last night appreciative audiences greeted
the excellent cast that portrayed for them
the well-known characters of the .Hoyt
favorite. The company is a strong one.
James R. McCann as the cattle king.
Maverick Brander, does creditable work,
and his associates complete a company of

Temperance Women to Meet.
A row in a resort at 414 Pacific street
last evening resulted in the cutting of
Mary. Cuellio and Victor Walcott and the
arrest of Tony Viola on two charts of
assault to commit murder. Viola entered
the place and attempted to claim the at
tention of Annie Schwartz. ' Walcott re
sented this and a fight ensued. The Cu
ellio woman took a hand and Viola drew
a knife, cutting them both about the head,
but not seriously. â¢ Both patients were
treated at the Harbor Receiving -Hospital.

I It is not my Intention to discourse upon the
theory of a bodily resurrection, nor to speculate
upon the perpetuity or an individual through
the boundless ages of eternity. It Is rather my
purpose to discuss the more important matter
of the amendment of human conduct to the end
that the example of -a. virtuous and well spent
life may be a living exemplification of right
eousness long after he who lived It shall have
passed away. The sages of Israel have taught
that this world is but a vestibule in which we
must make preparation to meet the king who
dwells within the temple before which it
stands. It is the perfectness of the preparation
alone with which v.e are concerned, for the
degree of perfection reached by one in this life
is after all, all that this world is benefited
by.
The prophets of Israel frequently used the
simile of a resurrection to portray the revival
of the national glory of Israel, contrasting with
this future resumption of national life the ut
ter annihilation of the pagan nations of old.
But we to-day make stfll other use of this
figure of speech. Our past is never dead;
though buried it would long have been if our
desire in regard to it were consulted. Ever
and anon some chapter of the book we would
fain seal recurs to our minds with the vldid
ness of a transaction of yesterday. To most
of us it is a disturbing element because it rude
ly interrupts our sacred service of self-wor
ship; yet, there it comes to us like a kind friend
to warn. and to counsel us against folly. The
obtrusion is a mercy extended to us. The In
trusion upon us at a solemn moment of the
acts of the past is necessary to that state of
moral perfection we hope to attain on earth.
Yea. our deadened consciences will live. Our
benumbed sentiments of religion will be
aroused; our burled instincts will be disen
tombed when the heavenly dew, the dew of
light, will be shed upon us and we cast 1 away
our baser selves. . ,

Thus the motherhood of Israel will once again
become the sacred suggestion of the deep foun
dations of society consecrated by . divine au
thority, resting In faith founded In order and
upon those conditions alone indestructible for
all future days.
Mothers make the best of teachers. Their
hearts proceed where man's solid thought will
not penetrate. Motherhood is the threshold
upon which lingers a new generation to make
or mar itself for better or for worse. If you
would ask me where is belief of God founded
most deeply and strongrly I would answer In the
sacred emotions of maternity, for not only is
their loving care a mundane attribution of
God's providence itself, but the love that bears
and nurses children is always more or 'less
fearful lest the stones of life may shatter. fond
hopes. Hence comes this longjng for communi
cation with God In whose hands are the changes
and Issues of life. Â¦ Â¦- . â¢
Hannah as a type of motherhood suggests
three ideas, the typs of divine authority, the
type of faith and the type of order. In these
three are the strongest pillars of society and In
view of the unsettled state of affairs the lesson
is necessary. ;.

who, for a long time, knew not the bless
