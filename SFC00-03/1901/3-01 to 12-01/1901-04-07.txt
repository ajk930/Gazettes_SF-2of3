A PROPHECY FOR
THE FUTURE.
As Redeemer and as Judge he shall
( come on that last day, glorious as when
'on the first Easter Sunday the Roman
soldiers swooned and became as dÂ«cid men
before the effulgence of His majesty. Ho
comes as Redeemer of thotÂ»s who have
modeled thÂ».ir lives on his, Â«-j Judge of
those who haÂ«*e despised his commands
and neglected his warnings. There is a
resurrection to glÂ«:y and a resurrection
to ignominy. Here now In our lives we
weave the vesture with which we shall
then be clothed. Our fate Is in our own
hands. Christ is our model. He is rich
in grace and power, so that what we can
not of ourselves accomplish, we can se
cure with his help. Happy for us if this
Easter Sunday we take that highest help
he gives or can give, to wit, himselfâ
that mystic food in whose strength, like
Elias of old, we may reach the mountain
or Godâ the commu.-.ion of his body and
blood by which we are made verily bone
of his bone and flesh of his flesh â for
that â¢-*: f-tery is the seed of Immortality
and the pledge of the Resurrect.on which
is the final criumph over sin and death,
the resurrection unto glory that knows
no cnJ.
Christ's resurrection is the model of our
resurrection." Even as he rose from the
dead so shall we. On the last day the
vls+on of Ezekiel shall be fulfilled and
the spirit shall blow from the four winds
of heaven on the dust of all the children
of Adam, and the sea shall give up her
dead, and we all shall stand clothed in
our proper flesh, and with our eyes we
shall see our Redeemer and our Â»vdge.
The Resurrection therefore is the great
foundation stone of the Christian faith.
It was Christ's own proof of the divinity
of his mission. They who preached his
gospel, they who sealed their belief with
their blood, called themselves martyrs,
that Is to say, witnesses, for they bear
testimony to the fact that they had seen
him alive after his resurrection, that
they had spoken to him, that they had
eaten at the same table with him, aye,
and that some of them had put their
hands into the place of the nails and into
the wound made by the soldier's spear.
This truth it was that nerved them to
do and dare all things; and well does the
apostle say: "If Christ ' be not risen
again, then are wÂ« the most miserable
of men."
But in. vain are all precautions again n
â¢ God. Christ wae offered because it wa3
his own will. He died because it was his
gracious pleasure- to go hand in har.'l
with us through the gates of the gravo
and to drink the chalice we all muit.
drinkâ the bitter cup of death. And now,
to manifest his power, and to seal his
mission, in his own good time he rtse3
like a giant refreshed with sleep, and
comes forth from the sepulcher victorious
over hell 'and death, leading captivity
captive.
The Resurrection is no Isolated, fact In
Christ's life. Toward it all his preaching
pointed. It was the complement to his
passion. "The Son of man shall be^.deliv
cred to the gentiles to be put to death,
and on the third day he shall rise again."
When his adversaries asked him for s
eign. a proof, a miracle to bring in the
divine power as a testimony to his mis
sion, he answered them: "A wicked and
an adulterous- generation seeketh a sign,
but no sign shall be given it. save the
sign of Jonas the prophet. For as
Jonas was in the whale's belly three
days 'and three nights, so shall the
Son of man be in the heart of the earth
three days and three nights." This was
to be the supreme test and the supreme
proof. "Destroy this temple and In three
days I will build it" up again." His ene
mies were to work their will upon him.
they were to bring him down with lgno-.
miny to the- grave, and then, when all
seemed lost, when his days were cut off.
when his career was ended, he would
break their bonds asunder, he would rise
in his might, he would cast their yoke
far from him, he would come forth in his
glory and ptand before the world the liv
ing son of the livinc God.
Christ was betrayed, mocked, scourged
and spat upon. He was nailed to the
cross. He died. He was laid in a
stranger's sepulcher. The door thereof
was sealed and the Roman soldiers were
set on guard. His enemies breathed free
ly. The high priest's prophecy was ful
filled. "It was necessary that one man
should die for the people."
takes the place of the old Jewish
festival which commemorated the de
liverance of the chosen people from the
house of bondage. It is the promise of
our deliverance from the bonds of death,
the pledge of our triumph over the all
conquering grave. O grave, where is thy
victory? O "death, where Is thy sting?

Presbyterians have never manifested

is not far to seek; for. these names con

â¢When in Edinburgh last year it was
with a pride that humbled and yet made
strong that I was. able to show my wife
the name of one of my ancestors on the
martyrs' monument in Grayfriars church
yard of Edinburgh. He was one of d8,000
Scotchmen who gave up their lives for
the faith In. the testing days m of the
covenant. But, Scotchmen, I am glad to
say, know how' to forget and forgive as
well as ' remember. For centuries the
names Christmas and Easter have been
associated by them with .papacy and epis

THE MEANING THAT
EASTER HAS
COME TO HAVE
AT THE
PRESENT DAY.
By George C. Adams, D.D.
THE observance of Easter has been
a growth. There is no Divine com
mand for it: to the Jew It probably
seems to be a usurper, taking tha
place of the Passover, and .n Latin
races the name for It even. Is bor
rowed from that great feast.' It simply
prew from . the great l<\ve of the early
dlscfplcs for the fact of the resurrection,
and a.i thoughts connected with it. It
grew up in diversity, Christians of Jewish
origin observing one day and those of Gen
tile birth another; then they got to calling
eaqh other hard names and that sort of
Christian warfare that has so often ap
peared in history arose, and for many
years Interfered with the Christ spirit.
The Council of Nlcaea. in A. D. 323. tried
to remedy this and make all Christians
observe the same day. They succeeded as
to the form but not as to the spirit.
Hundreds of years later came the Refor
mation and the separation of Protestant
from Catholic. The feeling was so strong
that especially among Scotch Presby-
terlans anrl English Dissenters nothing
was allowed that in any way reminded
them of Romish worship. It is difficult
now for us to appreciate the terrible ab
horrerce our Puritan ancestors had of
all forms and ceremonies: we are liable
to do them Injustice because we forget
the age In which they lived and the in
fluences under which their worship had
been established. Any kind of separation
A SERMON ON THE
EMPTY TOMB.
By Rev. A. T. Needham.
between those who have been accustomed
to worship together leads to extremes, and
minor uifferences are magnified and made
to stand for that which they never meant
before. So. Protestants would put no
crosses on their churches, allow no forms
or ceremonies In their services, observe
no special days, simply because it would
savor of the worship from which they had
separated themselves. For many years a
large part of the church missed the In
spiration of Christmas and Easter, just
because It would scera to lead back to tha
church they, had left.
We ousht to be thankful that we are
not living in a controversial age. The
world has progressed and to-day Protes
tant and Catholic can meet on common
ground; we believe in the same Savior;
we worship the same Father: tha same
day3 have significance for us. Eacft of
us loves his own church and its traditions
and forms, and expects to stick to It; but
a larger appreciation has appeared than
has ever existed before: we are drawing
nearer to the Master we serve, and as
we do so we draw nearer to one another.
And so the Easter sunshine falls on
churches of all denominations decorated
as beautifully as love and abundant blos-
MATT. 28:6. Â¦ "He i3 not here; for
he is risen, as* he said. Come,
see the place where the Lord
lay." ,
Mark and Luke inform us that
the women entered the. tomb, and saw for
themselves that the body which Joseph
of Arlmathea and. Nicodenius had con
veyed to the sepulcher was not there.
They are reproached by the angels for
'their evident unbelief. Indicated in their
expectancy to find the. body, and their
manifest purpose to embalm It. Here In
this vacant tomb they may ask "How are
the dead ralsed?'and with what -body do
they come?" but the how of the resurrec
tion' will- always â¢be ; unanswered by the
creature man.- All we have to do with
is the fact": a body was laid there inani
mate, that body is not there, was not
removed by human hands, but It does ap
pear again to the disciples, and the unbe
lieving among them are appealed to thus â
"Behold BByfhanttiJ and n|y feet, that it
13 myi'eJf; handle'me, and "see; for a- spirit
hath not flesh find bones, as ye see me
have. And when he" had thus spoken, hÂ«
showed them his hands and his feet."
(Luke 24:39, 40.)" ~
It was not the raising- of a mere ;erm:
for there was no residue of matter left
where the body had lain. It was not a
mere phantom or spirit: for it had bodily
parts that were tangible; and yet that
body came into the room where Christ's
disciples were- assembled, the door being
shut,' and after conversing with them
awhile, as mysteriously disappeared. The
whole thing rs mysterious to the disciples,
and yet palpable fact.' Their senses and
Â¦ their recsonare cognizant of the actual
facts, but there their limited, powers leave
them Shall they doubt the report of
their "senses, and disregard the conclu
sions of their reason,' and deny the facts
because the how. of their occurrence 13
Â¦beyond their knowledge? .With such pal
pable evidences of an actual resurrection
it is not Incredible that "all that are in
the graves shall hear the voice" of Him
th^t created them, "and shall come forth;
they that have done good, unto the resur
rection of life; and they that have done
evil, urto the resurrection "of damna
tion." (John 5:2S, 29.)
The mystery of creation is beyond our
ken, and ; why doubt If the 'resurrection
also coi found our feeble powers. Shall
the fact that is seen be denied because
the how of its existence Is Incomprehensi
ble? Let us not 'stultify ourselves by our
denials, or our doubts. &i\
There Is in the National Â¦ Museum - a
glass case on which are these words:
"The body of a man weighing 154 pounds."
There is no body in sight,, but there are
jars, bottles and parcels, these containing
fatty substances, liquids, gases and chem
icals .which together comprise the ingre
idlents of 'Which the human body Is com
posed. Mix these together, and still the
mechanical structure of the body will be
lacking; impart the structure; and still
the vital principle will be wanting; : and
the whole". "thing will, be but inanimate
clay. After man has done his utmost' to
create the human bodjf, he will be com
pelled to." confess^ "I am fearfully and
wonderlully Â¦ made." .
\ These bodies /of ours which have been
so .'important : a part of, ourselves, that
have beeji with us in every vicissitude of
life,; have' come' to have a peculiar rela
jtion to.every experience of the soul, and
.are not to be cast aside with as little feel
ing as when we throw off a'wornout gar
â¢inent. I know' not what .In .these bodies
may be adapted to the conditions in the
world beyond; but.it is joy to me to
know that that which in -.the grave "is
sown In corruption, it . shall be raised In
Incorruption.".- Itâ the thing buriedâ shall
not wholly pass" a way;; it shall rise again.
The' old home rehabilitated will not bo
without Its sources of 'pleasure and con
solationand'delightful association.
Whatever it may be to others, it Is a
delight to me to contemplate the empty
grave, as dispossessed of its tenant, and
companion forever. ."For when he shall
never know pain nor decay, is to be my
companion forever/ "For when He shall
appear we shall be like him," whose re
surrection is the earnest of ours.:

So the Easter of to-day stands for
Christian unity, the real unity, not forced,
not brought about by planning:, but tho
same spirit animating those of dl versa
views, and " for at least one day in the
year bringing the same thought home to
all. All the tracts that have been printed,
all the efforts of self appointed reformers
have not approached within a thousand
miles what has been accomplished In
bringing together the disciples of Jesus by
one thought and purpose permeating tha
whole sreat church. The" moment we- be
gin to try to argue ourselves together wa
succeed In arguing ourselves farther
apart: but when we drop all that, and
simply follow the leading of a great
spiritual thought, and allow the lovo of
God to have a chance at us, we are one
church. We are not likely to become one
by looking at each other and seeking some
common ground; the future unity of tha .
church is to come by the sunshine, not
the north wind, by melting together, not
; freezing together. We will foster every
thing that helps us to forget some things
. and . remember others; we will make
Easter as bright and helpful as we know
how to make it, and we will pray God for
his blessing on all who bear his name,
wb.tber they worship with us or speak
our shibboleth or not.
Easter emphasizes the fact that belief
in Christ is more deep seated in humanity
than we sometimes suppose; when we
have eliminated all that is not strictly
religiou3, the new clothing, the thoughts
of spring, the special music, all that goes
to make the day a special one aside from
its real significance, there remains this,
that we are all rejoicing in the thought
of the resurrection and the conquest over
the grave. There is a. deep seated prin
ciple that !s moving U3 all; whether we
'have ever said so or not we are conscious
that the love of our Heavenly Fath
er;, is ' about us and we are rejoicing
that it has been so manifested that It is
clear to ux" Thousands of people who
never see the inside of a church for the
rest of the year forget to go fishing or
visiting ard for once go to church: we
wish they would go every Sunday; we be
lieve It would rest them more than any
thing else, but It is a significant fact
that they go this day. and they look for
ward to it and plan for It for weeks before
and talk about It for weeks after. Deep
down under the seeming carelessness of
men Is the sense of need of a Savior and
gladness in the thought of what he has
done.' GEORGE C. ADAMS. D. D.. ,

HOW CHRIST CAME
TO HIS THRONE.
By Rey.;R^C. Brook?.
GJSE,. week before the first Eastei
i morning' the Lord Jesus entered
Jerusalem amid the acclaims of a
' great 'multitude, who, hailed Mm
as'king, strewing in his pathway
the emblematic branches of the palm.
The possession of a throne from which
to /rule the- worldâ this -was the dream ol
all men. -To Â¦ Roman and Jew alike, the
.vision of universal empire . was the dream
of life. 'The Roman citizen was eager, tc
complete the almost' finished universal
sway of Rome. . The faithful son of Israel
waited/for the" Messiah,' who should make
the Jew ruler over all nations. Had'not
.the hour come, when this man ofNazer
ethâthe most remarkable among. the sons
of menâ should -restore the \ kingdom to
Israel? So: thought .many. . But' disap
pointed and impatient, wltn one who
counted, of little worth -the applause of
men, inless than a week -they joined the
cry, "Crucify Him," and the vision of 'the
moment was completely] eclipsed. . History
has strongly reversed the verdict' which
his own generation "finally.' passed upon
Jesus, and the fanatic of Galilee, as they
counted him, .whose life was a failure
judged by ; any . ordinary, standard, -men
are now . beginning to see - lived the one
supremely successful life. Indeed 'the
most majestic and thrilling fact in human
history is; the coronation from every de
partment of human activity of this man
of /Nazarethâ the Christ of Calvary â until
all the world joins in the coronation, and
the crowning ; goes < on ,'Â¦ from age to age.
Poetry and, painting, sculpture and music,
science' and philosophy, literature and life,
haveVbronght their crowns to place upon
his head. Â¦;:;", Â¦
..How came Christ to such a throne 1 ?. He
organized no army, he sought * to found
no empire, he , established no school, he
wrote no book, and yet before the Roman
eagles perished % his ;, kingdom included, a
greater population than ancient!- Rome.
How did it come about?
.'He loved : men and gave himself for
them. That is the. whole story. .When he
saw distress he Â¦ brought relief and com
fort. When <his friends .were unfaithful
he-loved * them to -"the -end. â¢ When Peter
denied." he r.nswcred the denial ; with a
fTvHE^ â¢writer was educated; among
J Baptists who were afraid of Easter
I' They said it belonged to the Rornar
I Catholic church. We have nevei
discovered when this 'church laic
claim to It. Easter day does not belong
to any one church more than another.
Easter is a fact that belongs to the world,
We prefer Easter to Christmas. T'm
I world 'with its gay wicked-, life has
crowded itself into Christmas. It is a
holiday season. In pome places it is mixec
with merriment that* is neither sober ol
instructive. People go into debt for the
gifts they offer. Easter has no meanin?
except to' the thoughtful.' If you do not
observe it in a religious sense you cannot
observe it at all.. It' is meaningless tt
those who do. not tnink of life, death and
immortality. It is appropriate that these
subjects should claim our attention to .thÂ»
exclusion of all others, at least once, .a
year. . S ;
We prefer Easter to Ghristmas because
it is a consummation.' Christmas Is a be
ginning. Beginnings are full of uncer
tainty. A beginning contains a doubt as
well as a prophecy. "What will . the end
be? Where there is doubt there is unrest.
The Babe of Bethlehem did not seem like
ly to succeed. Easter is the climax of
that history. It is victory at -last.
"Fought the fight, the battle won." We
worship now the truly successful life.
Even if it is all a, story; as some would
have us believe, it is a story with a beau
tiful and helpful ending. The shadow of
the cross "was on the cradle. It Is on
every cradle. The glory of the crown
shines on Easter. Between the crafle and
the crown there was the perfect obedience
to the Father's will. The completed life
suggests the consecration of ChFist and
the faithfulness of the Father.
We prefer Easter to Christmas because
It is suitable to every one's experience.
The world's great heart may hot be
Christian, but it appreciates the truth or
Easter. It needs the truth, therefore- it
accepts it. Christmas tells of a .birth, but
there are thousands of homes in ".which
there is no child. There are multitudes
who, through their own choice, will never
be fathers or mothers.. Child life is beau
tiful to them, but not necessary to their
happiness. But who has not lost a friend?
Who has not parted with a" dear one at

astrologer calls attention to the number

scope, referring back to the ninth arcana
major, the Throne of Osius. A picture of

In the theme of rpvoiuticn. the sword,
scepter, and g-old are threatened by bad
aspects. Indicating that two of them will
be put to the service of the other.
Fatality of the Number 9.
The fatality of the number 9 with re
spect to this family is remarkable. The
Duke of Kent, father of the late Queen,
was one of nine children, while Victoria
was the ninth sovereign of England since
the re\ olution of 1CSS. She was born in 1819,
mounted the throne In 1S37 (1 plus 8,plua
2 plus 7 equals 19. when she was 19 years
old. She had nine children. Her eldest
son was born 1 on November 9. The Prince
of Wales married the daughter of Chris
tian IX of Denmark, who at the time was
19 years old. It was at the age of 81 (8
plus 1 equals 9> that the Queen died, hav
ing received her deathstroke. of paralysis
en January 9. Â»
The threats of the King-s horoscope co-
incide also with the unlucky month of
January, In Â¦which he ascended the throne.
His great-grandfather, George III. died
In January, 1820. His grandfather, the
Duke of Kent, died in the same month of
the same year. His great-aunt, the Prin
cess Elizabeth of Hesse-Hamburg, died
on January 5, 1840. His great-uncle, Fred
erick, Duke of York, died in January,
1827. His son, the Duke of Clarence, died
in January, Â«1S92. And his brothe.r-in-law,
Henry, of Battenberg, died in January,

Advice to the Kaiser. . .
The" Kaiser's horoscope shows no death
due at the present time. In order to throw
more light on the question one astrologer
has recourse to a kind of cabalistic analy
sis. From the letters contained in the He
brew words of the date, the question, the
Kaiser's name, and the name of the rul
ing planel at the time of the apparition,
he disengaged the following counsel:
"Shut yourself up in your proper sphere,
out of which you are speedily threatened
with deceptions, treasons and ennuis, be
cause your temperament will Infallibly
carry you beyond the Â¦ limits you have set
for yourself." .
While the new relations which threaten
the Kaiser are many, he himself is sure
to be as Injurious to them. Especially to
new and powerful friends does the Kaiser
threaten to be injurious. He will have
redoubtable enemies in the high grades
.of both the army and navy. His horo
sccpe promises him the solution. of many
difficulties " by means of secret societies,
but he is at the same time warned against
the ideas they may suggest to him and
the. acts they may lead him to commit.
Again, he must 'be on his guard against
sick people, for contagious diseases prom
ise to be injurious to him. If he be raised
to' an even higher .dignity ; than -that he
now possesses its cause will be fortuitous,
and he ought not to felicitate himself on
his supposed good fortune. It will 1 be pre-
carious, and he will have to fear reverses
whose "consequences .may.be excessively
grave. â¢ ... . "
When the Kaiser leans j too heavily on
the sword; and counts too much on force
let him remember the words,* "Who-" takes
up the sword will perish by the eword."
Nevertheless, his-own life is not' threat
ened by violence. "-Â¦ His planetary aspects
for 1901 suggest instead: ."Let your health
be dear to you. Be vigilant in your eat
ing, drinking and bathing." Saturn and
Mars this year are unfavorable to his
family. â¢ threatening . equally his royal
spouse. -
Forecast for Wilhelmina. -
The Queen of Holland received at her
birth, on Â¦ August 31, 1880. - the names of
Wilhelmina Helena Pauline : Maria, and
she is of . the house of Nassau, Â¦ whose
astrology . has been worked out a hundred
times." These names and the family name
added -together, ' caballstically give the
number, twenty-three, the first of the
minor arcana.' which Is the Master of the
Scepter. - This 'arcana.', represents the
young .! Queen beautifully, 1 because it is
symbolized by a crowned King, seated on
a throne arid holding a Fcepter In hjs right
hand. : The j maxim .which refers "to Â¦ this
arcana recommends -:- ; the - consultant to
seek , a protector and .: counselor in both
private and public acts. .' The sign .under
which" Wilhelmina , was . ,born . gives a
double character" and a cold, power of rea
soning. ' â¢ nevertheless .-: susceptible ' â¢ to
changes of ideas. The will,- though strong,
may, be ' moved by either the sentiments
of the'heart or of.interest. The sign gives
equally intelligence, ingenuity,: the love of
beautiful things, , and a j[ certain slowness
to anger.. ; It is a' double sign r arid some
times, therefore! ~! modifies the ideas and
sentiments â¢already- formed.- 1 It â¢ may - also
lead s to two Â¦ marriages. - ' Â¦ â¢ '
;. The enemies which the young Queen has
to . fear., are financiers . and : ; courtiers of
high situation. Disputes about â¢ property
threaten to "cause her much trouble. . In
the years Â¦when Saturn shall be in the
Twins,' in quadrature with Venus, there
will.be danger for marriage, or children {
apd this danger will' coma from two
causes: By the fault of the Queenâ that
is to say, a. certain haughty self-con
fidence Joined to Inconsistency of resolu
tion on -her part: and by the faults of
othfir ; wpmen and people in high places,
who may *Â¦ be a cause : of * scandals.
Treasons of friends and near relatives are
to be feared., as well as falls and sub

of the Hebrew ' letters of names, dates
and planets, spreading out the sums and

this incantation was pronounced by a

THE Germans are making arrange
ments to beat ths Americans in the
speed of their railroad trains. A
rate of from 125 to 135 miles per hour
is to be attained on the military line from
Berlin to Zossen. The cars, which will
run singly, will be propelled by electricity.
Two cars are being built, one by the Gen
eral Electricity Company, and one by the
firm of Siemens & Halske.
Emperor William, who Is always pro

has expressed himself as in favor of a
complete ' change of the entire railway

be used for the transportation of the pns-
Bengers, though for the present it will be
necessary to continue using steam for
freight. At a recent conference between,
the Kaiser and Prince Counselor Rathe
nau. superintendent of the works of the
General Electricity Company, the latter
declared that it would be a great na
tional triumph If Germany could be th*Â»
leader In the creation of the means of
T
transportation.
Several financiers and princes of In
dustry some time ago formed a society
to consider the applicatJcn of electricity
to railway roads. A result of their -wort
Is, that the military 'ine between Berlin

lovely colors, but Â¦ medicines and scents
enough" to stock . a chemist's * and * per
fumer's, soap. ,-Â¦ . . _, ':....'Â¦
.; The first man who,. 160 years ago,: tried
to \ experiment .with coal tarâa-German
called. Stauffâ very nearly died from suf
focation. - It was ; 120 years before chem
ists . learned to deal . with , coal , tar ". and
first obtained the beautiful; aniline pur- ;
pie- or: mauve dye. 'Â¦ Two ; millions . and Va
half of money- was spent' In -1S99 on coal- Â¦
tar dyes in British factories.
So great was the excitement when the
purple aniline dye was first discovered
that a - Parisian manufacturer made the
city authorities an offer of Â£8000 It ho
might be permitted to take up the as
phalt in one of the principal streets In
order to distil it for use In his dye
works. Purple became' the fashion, and
remained so for four successive seasons.
The newer coal dyes owe' their discov
ery to the quinine famine 6i 1S30. In that
year quinine became "so expensive that
Professor Dewar and other scientists be
gan experimenting to find a â¢ substitute
which would do equally well to cool the
blood in fever. The first result of their
experiments / were the delicate yellows
and brown obtained from benzine. Then
quinoline was hit upon â a drug with just
the same' bitter taste as quinine, equally
powerful in fighting fever, and leaving
none of quinine's evil effects. "Qulnottne.
also, costs . less than half as much as
quinine.
Antipyrin, even stronger and more last
ing in its effects, and without any bitter
ness at all, was- the next development.
Hundreds of. pounds of this drug have
been shipped lately to South Africa, to
help_ the doctors . in . their 'fight against
enteric, fever.'
Still; another! boon from coal tar Is the
drug Â¦called thallln, which is much the
best Â¦ medicine ; known ; to - cure a patient
of ; the dreaded, yellow fever. . In " all," sev
enteen new t medicines owe their origin to
coal tar. - '
"Extracts of new-mown bay" and other
similar delicate perfumes are obtained
from a substance called cumarin, which,
up. to a few years ago was extracted
from i sweet woodruff and other scented
grasses. Dr. Perkin discovered that
cumarin could be obtained by distillation
of oue of the volatile oils of coal tar.
"White heliotrope is also made almost en- '
tirely from coal, together with seven
other scents, generally known by the
names of the flowers they used to be ex
tracted from. The island of Mauritius
lost much of it3 scent industry through
the rivalry of coal-tar scent.
Vanillin, one of the most delicate prod
ucts of coal, is used by the gallon in
making the extract of vanila, for flavor-
Ing custards and puddings. â¢
Besides these dyes and scents, coal
tar gives us that greatest boon of the
man whose doctor won't let him tako
sugar â namely, saccharin. Of this sub
stance, one pound is equal to two hun
dred-weight of sugar, as far as sweeten
ing power goes. It Is quite wnoiesome,
and â¢ Is, Into the bargain, a capital dis
infectant. Jam made with saccharin
ought to keep forever.
Coal tar and scents are by no means
cheap and nasty substitutes. They 'are
all harmlessâ sometimes more harmless
than the original preparations they have
superseded. And, In spite of the evil
odor of coal tar, not ' cne workman has '
ever been made HI by dealing with it.â *.

SOME THING ABOUT SILK THAT ARE
NOT GENERALLY KNOWN.
<^=r? LMOST every worm of aerial

ii p The caterpillars' nests so fre

ies are no more than big. unkempt and
composite cocoons. Solitary creepers have
the same power of eilk production. . In
fact, many of them emulate those gentle

which spins a brilliant yellow silk in such
profusion the natives and the Spaniards

Italy and China furnish the best silk,

Chinese -working -women get daily wages
of 3 cents. Everywhere it is women who
do most of the work in rearing the worms.
Men bring in the {resh' leaves and culti

worms, frcm the egg to the cocoon.
Â¦ To ' keep the eggs dormant ' requires a
temperature just above freezing. They
must not .be laid in the hatching trays

molt the leaves ; axa only 1 torn. Thence-
forward they are used whole, but mutt

They are stripped from the young shoots
just before they reach full size. A tree
that has given, all its early leavfcs to - the
silkworm brood is so .weakened that > it
may die. Consequently trees are not fully
stripped unless under great stress. ' '
.After tha fifth molt the worms, "fat,
green, sluggish r-Al*-, refuse to eat and be
gin moving their heads ' rapidly from side
to side. This is the sign of cocoon spin,
nlng, so the women supply the trays with
bundles of clean, short twigs. Upon these
the worms* crawl, attach themselves and
begin spinning.- The cocoon is^ finished in
twelve to twenty-four hours. * The good
ness or badness of it is judged less by the
size than the weight and symmetry.
A percentage of the finest : cocoons are
set apart, to hatch and- produce next
year's eggs. The rest are baked at a

THERE come times in the career of
every housekeeper when either the
novelties are exhausted or she Is ex
hausted with them. Many of them
are abnormal, forced sort of things; in
gredients mingled without rhyme or rea
son, much as the clashing colors of a
hat are mingled by a desperate milliner
seeking novelty where no novelty is left
except in combination.
Once in awhile the housekeeper, es
pecially the young one. wishes she knew
the best way of preparing the old things;
the roast of beef or the broiled lobster or
the cocoa. They can never be improved
uponâ they can only be varied: and now
and then simplicity is the greatest variety
Â¦ that can be achieve*!.
It is at such times that these recipes
may come in handy. They don't pretend
to be new, but they are good.
Boast. of Beef.
Scar the beef on all sides Jn a frying
pan, then place in a roasting pan with
one cupful of water. Put In hot oven and
baste every fifteen minutes with the juice
seasoned with salt and pepper. When
nearly done place sliced cooked carrots in
the-pan to brown; serve on same platter
with beef.
The fresh ham, when it Is tender, is
altogether too delicious a meat to be ig
nored. It is good either boiled or roasted;
sharp seasoning is one of the secrets of
its successful preparation. . Don't attempt
to boil it without laying in a stock of
herbs in the first place. Here is an ex
cellent rule. . .
Boiled Leg of Pork.
Cover with boiling water a fresh ham,
adding a quarter cf a cup of salt, one
onion and one bunch of herbs. When
done score the rind and brown in hot
oven; serve on a bed of boiled kidney
beans, seasoned with salt, pepper and but

No recipe has ever been offered, how
ever, in which the lobster did not have to
be "killed. The best that can be done is
to propose the easy death of boiling

the rope and lifted the water gate, with
the result practically of diverting the

quite a stream and the water supply was
almost always ample. '
IN the RIehland County Infirmary, near
Mansfield, Ohio, sits a white faced wo
man, who seldom raises her eyes from
a heavy gold band ring on the third
finger of her left hand. For twenty-five
3 ears Jane Swank has never spoken a
tingle word to a human being.
All the light and joy went out of her
life when she was a young woman with
her heart beating tumultuously for its
I":rst sic at pcsslon. Her father hated her
lever. He bade her give up all thought
ui him. to promise never to see him again.
The girl refused and on her knees, with
tho tears coursing down her cheeks, beg-
K<>d her father to relent. The father flew
ir.tr. a fit of passion that h!s only daugh
ter should set his commands at deilance.
He picked u? a heavy cane and beat the
girl until Fhe lay insensible on the floor.
When she was found by some of her
roicrhlx.rs and cared for It was discov
ered that reafcon had fled. Since then she
hap been en inmate of hospitals and asy
lums.
Twenty-eight years ago the Swank fam
ily moved to Jackson Township, In Rich
*.and County, Ohio, from Pennsylvania
Part of the purpose of Jane's father In
moving west was to separate the girl from
the young man with whom she was very
much in love and whom the father hated.
The young man soon came out to Ohio
for a visit with ills sweetheart. Jane
promised to marry him and a date was
set for the wedding. The young man gave
Jane a heavy gold engagement ring and
then, with many avowals of love and
promises to be faithful, the two parted.
After her sweetheart had gone Jane
watched eagerly every day for his letters,
but none came, for her father intercepted
them. Finally r>ne night he demanded of
the girl to throw away her ring and to
promise to give up her lover. When she re
fused and wept the father beat her until
ehe lay unconscious at his feet. Th-Â»
neighbors heard of the tragedy and j a
lynching party was organized to hunt for
the elder Ev.-ank, but while he was hid
ing in the woods near his house during
a storm a nee fell on him and killed him.
The suitor to rhom Jane had been en
gaged hunted her up in the asylum in
which she was incarcerated and tried to
call her back to reason. But she did not '
know him, screamed when he came near
her. and he finally went away a heart
broken man.
The rrold ring was the only thing In

was lost and the poor woman procured a
piece of twine and wore that on her finger

"In the house that I told you

with water .from a beautiful clear, stream
of considerable size that ran close by one

about the bathtub at all was to put it at
the right level, and, of course, that was
the work of a civil engineer. We sent to
the neighboring town and got out an en

THE prettiest Easter wedding | this
Lenten season will be . celebrated
down in Tombstone. Arizona. â¢ It is
a romance that has its* beginning
in San Francisco, where James
Wells first met Miss Jessie Shatter, an
Arizona girl who was visiting friends in
this city. Not an exciting prelude to a
love story, but it has an interesting, pecu
liar finale that is puzzling Arizona people.
Was Jim Wells guided to the Savior
Spring by the supernatural appearance of
his sweetheart when he was perishing
of thirst on the Arizona desert, or was her
ligure merely a wild chimera- of his fev
ered brain?
That is the question the friends of Jim
Wells and Miss Shatter are asking now
that he is well on the road to health and
their marriage is on the calendar for
Easter day. * ' .
Wells' story of his adventure is a weird
one, and smacks as much of the super
. natural as anything in Pac or Hoffman.
He is well known in San Francisco,
where he is connected with several
wealthy families, but for several years
he has been in business in Southeastern
Arizona. Of late years certain prospect
holes he owned seemed to waken up in
the mining boom that has been sweep
ing over the Territory, and recently he
has been devoting more attention to their
development. It was while looking after
assessment work on one of them that he
tumbled on the abandoned Carib mines
and met with the adventure where he al
most lost his life and was saved only by
what he declares was "a real miracle."
and the saint who guided him was his
sweetheart, Jessie Shafter.
On one point, however, they are agreed,
namely, that Miss Jessie deserves to be
dubbed St. Jessie on. account of he* pure
goodness of heart, and this Easter they
are going to dance at the wedding of St.
Jessie. and Jim Wells.
Â¦ That's the story of Jim Wells* experi
ence-and that's the reason his friends are
asking each other: Was Jim guided to tb#Â»
Savior Spring by a vision of a saint or
was he plum loco and Just imagined that
he saw her? Â¦
â¢ She hastened to him and by the aid of
an unseen power guided him to a sprinsr.
Then she woke up , in a semi-hysterical
condition, "firmly believing she had had a
hideous nightmare. So overwrought was
she that she went into Mrs. Atkins' room,
woke her up and told her of the dreadful
dream she had had. 'Mrs. Atkins did her
best to comfort the girl, but the dream
had made such an impression on Jessie
that she could not go to sleep again that
night. She remained in this highly nervous
condition till Wells was driven up to the
house; in the buckboard of Billy Hinman.

a vivid dream and saw Jim struggling

"Get to the rear," continued he. In a
cool fashion; and as soon as the Confed

scribed with the names of battles and the
title' of the" regiment â Second Louisiana
Tigers. The sergeant grinned In his good
humor. He was , delighted with himself
at that moment." Standing on the staff he
ripped the flag off and stuffed It away
under his loose blouse.
"You had better ; let me j have that,"
somebody said behind him. â¢ Turning with
a jerk he saw the colonel of his regiment

briary shrubs, breathlessly going on. Then
appeared in front of him through an arch

Her forty-fifth birthday v.-ould fall upon
Easter Sunday, now but five days off.
They proposed to celebrate it by a gath
ering of no mean sort. Miss Deborali was
not ashamed to tell her age. She was
wont to say that she valued every year
ehe had lived, and would not show disre
i-peet to one cf the forty odd.
The Rev. Cecil Daneâ the straight." trim,
weil groomed gentleman to whom she was
telling her plans for the aforesaid ce'.e
braticnâwas" 50 years cf age. His eyes
were clear; his ciean-s?haven face had the
fresh color of a healthy boy; his semi
clerical attire was invariably correct; his
hands and feet were small and shapely.
THE list cf guests lay on the tab^

sparkles, also in rfcyllnafc order. Upon
the third finjjer of the hand that beat the
happy tattoo was a larger diamond in an
old-fashioned setting. The perns were
heirlooms. So was ths furniture of the
room tn which the two friends sat â a long,
low apartment, the ceiling crossed by
oaken beams. The house itself was co!o
r.lal, having been built in 1710 b" Gerar

rect line to Colonel Ten Eyck Glen, the
father of Miss Deborah Glen, the present
owner. She was the oily survivor of
eipht children bom under the venerab'.e
roof.

ness into the kind blue eyes bent upon her.
A pink mist rolled gently over Mr.
Dane's face until it lost itself in the fair
hair that was growing thin on the top of
his head. It might well happen that a
well-preserved man of 53 would.be more
sensitive as to his age than an independ
ent spinster who had. voluntarily entered
the old-maid ranks at 35. .
Mis3. Deborah ran on, her joyous. ex
citement blinding her to the possibility of
jarring her friend's sensibilities. â¢
' "I pride myself upon the ingenuity that
has devised comfortable quarters for one

VWould that - be best?" demurred the
other. , "I had thought, instead, of offer

prerogatives is -to be of service to you

/"You are mistaken there." She brought
the jeweled top of the pencil case down
upon- the table with a ringing rap. "You

into prismatic haloes upon the blackness
of the outer night. . The wind was shrill,
threatening, Insistent.
"A brutal night!" muttered the visitor,
taking off and shaking his mackintosh.

himself by sending to Glenwold a great
box of roses he had ordered from Albany,

of drifting rain that stiffened into" slant

ashore. Not a conveyance was in sight.
Nobody in his dry and sober senses would
be calling for a hack at the lonely land

seemed hardly to have heard them.

MISS
DEBORAH'S
EASTER
HOUSE
PARTYmarried John Mitchell afterward, but
that didn't make any difference. "Oh.
Loulsa.iyou did not allow euch a dreadful
thing.".' said Lauretta, and she colored up
as if John Mitchell had kissed her instead
of Louisa. Louisa didn't like it very well,
"yes, I did, and I am going to marry John
if he asks me; and -I 'can't see as I've done
anything very dreadful," said she. Â¦
."I- don't see how you could, Louisa,"
said Lauretta, and she still had that
shocked kind of look, and her face and
neck were red. ' Lauretta had the softest,
finest skin, and colored red as a rose in a
minute, and her blue eyes would widen
and grow round. I can see them now..
"You are too particular to live," said
Louisa. She told me afterward that she
didn't believe â¢Â¦ Lauretta was like other
girls. "I've seen her coming out of meet
ing actually hanging on mother's arm,
for fear somebody would ask to go home
with her," said Louisa. Louisa had ..al
ways a great many admirers, and did not
resort to subterfuges to keep themÂ«at bay.
."Edward Adams would be glad to go
home with her, 1 guess." I said.
."He's just dying to," replied Louisa. '-'I
can see him hanging around every Sun
day night after meeting-, but he can't go
home with Lauretta unless he goes with
mother; too. I never saw a girl like
Lauretta: 't;aon't believe she ever will
get. married: She won't give anybody a
chance." - .' â¢
I felt sort of sorry for Edward Adams,
because he was a good fellow and real in
tiipate . with Joseph Â¦ Greene, the man I
married three; years afterward. Joseph
used to tell me about how Edward felt.
"I never saw a man so used up as he is
over Lauretta," said he; "but she won't
look at him."
'.'She won't look at anybody elss, any
more," said I.
'. "No, that's seme comfort," said Joseph;
"but what is It, what has she got against
Edward?" vi* Â¦ - -
'Tin sure I don't know," said I.
I told JoBeph I would try to talk to Lau
retta, and see if I could iind out what the
trouble was; and so I did, but I didn t
make out much. I got a sort of idea that
perhaps it wasn't so much because she
was prim as we had always thought, as
because she didn't really believe any
young man wanted her, or loved her as
much as her mother did, but I wasn t
sure that I v/as right.
â¢Well, time went on, and Louisa and i
were both married, though Lauretta was
older. Â¦ She lived with her mother, and
clung to her just as tightly as ever. .Ed
ward Adams wasn't married either,
though he had paid attention to several.
He acted as if he had given up Lauretta.
Lauretta was 2S years old when the new
school teacher came to Ferrisville. She
was a beauty, and no mistake. I don t
know that she was any prettier than
Lauretta; but you could see her further,
and she came from the city, and knew
how to dress. Edward fro.ni the first
acted devoted to her. . He was on the
school committee, and so had a good ex
cuse to visit her school often; and he used
to walk home with her from meeting, and
take her sleigh riding, and Mrs. Lansing,
the woman where she boarded, said he
called on her real often. Folks began to
think It would be a match. That was the
winter when Lauretta's mother died, and
she was left all alone. Louisa couldn t
come to live with her, because her hus
band had his business in Morristown. and
couldn't leave; and Lauretta, though she
had enough to live on herself, couldn't af
ford to hire help. She settled down to live
alone, and it did seem real pitiful, she was
always such a timid little thing. For a
little while I used to go over and stay
all night with her; but, of course, I
couldn't keep- it up always. ' I said to Jo
seph that it was such a pity that she and
Edward hadn't got married, but he said
he guessed he'd got over it, that the new
school teacher suited him pretty well.
"I don't know," said I, "I've always
thought Edward Adams wasn't one to
shift about very easily from one to the
other; and Mrs. Lansing says he hasn't
been to call on the teacher quite so often
lately. I know he didn't go home with
her from meeting last Sunday night, and
I saw him looking at Lauretta, I don't,
believe but he has a good deal of feeling
for her, left alone the way she Is."
"More feeling than she would have for
him, I guess." said Joseph, rather grimly.
He was a little Inclined to be severe on
Lauretta; he had always thought so much
of Edward. "I guess Edv/ard is pretty
well eulted with the school teacher," he
said again: "and she's handsome as a pic
ture, a sight prettier than Lauretta."
,"I don't- know," said I, "and I don't
know about her being handsomer. You
men always think if a girl has blazing red
cheeks her beauty is settled. Lauretta
Is more delicate-looking, but it seems to
me she i3 much prettier."
"Not according to my way of think
ing," said Joseph. Joseph is a good man,
but he never trusts one woman's opinion
of another's beauty. / -, '
It was some three months after Lauret
ta's mother died, and the poor girl had
lived alone through one of the hardest
winters we had ever knownâ snowstorm
after snowstorm, and bitter coldâ and she
did have a lonesome time of it. I went in
there all I could, but much of the time
it was too bad for me to T'alk. ' I lived
half a mile away, and we didn't keep a
horse, and it was before the electric cars
were put in.' S^HS^
little droop at the corners of her mouth
and her blue eyes seemed to be always
looking past you. though she was pret
tier than ever. Black was very becoming
to Lauretta.
It was Easter Sunday when that hap
pened which no one has ever been able to
explain. I. for one. have "never tried to.
It has. always seemed to me just as well
to leave some things unexplained. Easter
Sunday was a beautiful day. the first
real mild day we had had. The air. was
s=oft as June, the snow had gone except
for patches here and there, the trees be
gan to look green\and filmy, and once in
a while you could hear a. bird. I may as
T.-cll tell It just as It happened as Lauretta,
told it to me. That Easter Sunday when
Lauretta canie downstairs fn the morning
to build her kitchen" fire she noticed a
very strong, sweet fragrance all over the
house, and the could not imagine what It
was: hut when she opened the sitting
room door she saw. There, on the table,
stood a great pot of Easter lilies. The
lamp was on the table, and the Bible and
her sewing,- and the pot of Easter lilies
scenting the whole room and the whole
house.
She just stared at It. She did not know
what to think for a irinute. Then she
saw that the window was open â the win
dow close to the table â and she reasoned
it out that somebody must have opened
it and sot the pot of lilies Inside. Then
all at once it flashed upon her that Ed
ward Adams must have done it. for .its
owned a little greenhouse, though he Uttl
not sell flowers. Ho was in the Savins*
Pank. She was sure tnat Edward
did it. and I was too when she called ire
in and showed. me the flowers. I went to
church that Sunday, and had to pass her
house, and she stood in the doorway and
called roe. "Won't you come In just a
minute?" eald she; "there's time
enough." ;.
So I let Joseph fro on. and I -went In.
"What have you got here so sweet?" said
I, the minute I. stepped inside.
"Look here." said Lauretta, and she led
me into the sitting-repxn and pointed tJ
the pot of Hlies.
I had never seen such beautiful lilies. T
can't begin to tell fcow many blossoms
there wore, and lha quantity of buds, and
anything like the fragrance. "Why, who
sent them?" said I.
"I found them here this moraine" said
Lauretta.
"Why. who sent them?"
"Who do you suppose?" asked Lau
retta. > - â¢
We looked at each other, then I beean.
to iaugh. I remembered Edward Adams'
greenhouse. "I guess It dcosn't require a
very sharp w't to tell," said I. and Lau
retta colored beautifully, and I saw thac
she thought as I did.
"Don't tell anybody." said she. She put
her arms around me when she said that,
and hid ber face on mv shoulder.
"Don't you worry, dear child." said I,
and stroked her pretty light hair. Lau
retta was Older than I. but she always
seemed younger.
Well. I had to hurry out and catch up
with Joseph, but when I saw Lauretta
come into the church a little later. I
thought I had never seen her look so
pretty. Her long black veil swept back
from her fair hair, and her face was as
delicate as a lily, with just such clear
curves, and she moved with such a shy
grace that people turned to look at her â
and I didn't wonder. To my mlrul the
school teacher, in a new Easter hat all
covered with roses, was tawdry beside
her. and I once caught Edward Adams
Jookfng at Lauretta, and I had my own
opinion.
It was such a beautiful Sunday, full
moonlight, that Joseph and I went to
meeting in the evening, and Lauretta
was there. v When meeting was over I
expected that 'she would do what she
had always done whenever she had hap
pened to be at evening meeting since her
mother diedâ edge up to me and- cling to
me going out, as she used to do to her,
mother; but that night she did not. I
looked around for her, and never was so
astonished In my life. I could not believe
It was Lauretta. She was actually mov
ing in that gentle. Imperceptible, gliding
fashion of hers, close to Edward Adams,
and she actually moved on ahead of the
school teacher. The school teacher's
roses brushed Lauretta's black veil, they
were so close together. Then I heard
Lauretta say "Good evening, Mr. Adams,"
of her own accord, and I could not be
lieve my ears. And I could not believe
my eyes when the school teacher passed
me, walking very fast with Mrs. Lansing;
it turned out afterward that she had been
engaged to somebody in Boston all the
time* and never told: and Lauretta fol
lowed behind us, leaning on Edward
Adams* arm. â¢ Â¦ ;â¢â¢"â¢Â¦
I looked around and nudged Joseph to
look. "Good Lord!" said he* so loudly
that I was afraid that tJiey would hear
him. and I had to hush him up.
Well, it wasn't a month before It was
all over the village that Edward Adams
and Lauretta, were engaged: and they
were married in the course of the sum
mer. Lauretta let her house and went to
live in Edward's. But that isn't the
strange rÂ»art of It all. Lauretta did not
say much to Edward about the pot of
lilies for some little. time; she had a sort
of feeling since he had brought th*m so
secretly, as she supposed, that there was
something sacred about it, that she would
not even thank him. So all she did was
to say how beautiful the lilies were when
he came Into the room which was so sweet
with them: and he said yes, as well he
might. There never were such lilies. But
after a while, when the blossoms had all
faded and the buds had bloomed and died,
she wondered what to do with the plant,
so she said something to Edward about
it. She thanked him for sending it. and
asked If it would not be best for him to
take it back to his greenhouse' and keep
it over until another year. Then it trans
pired that Edward had never sent that
pot of Easter lilies; that he had none like
it; that the pot was unlike anything he
had ever had; that he had never seen the
plant until that Easter Sunday when he
came into Lauretta's slttine-room.
They never found cut where that great
pot of lilies came from. Edward tried to
keep the plant, but it died before the next
Easter. He questioned all the florists for
miles about, but none of them knew any
thing about it. No one knew, and no one
ever will know. We can surmis* and
nuesticn, but we shall never know. But

]T is not in Uncle Dudley Bostwick's
nature to take things merely as they
come. While reading in his farm Jour
nal one day his attention was claimed
by an item containing the information
that cows are especially fond of the music
of the bagpipe.
"By playing a bagpipe in the barnyard."
the writer explained, "cows* can be in
duced to give more milk than they would
otherwise, and they make less fuss about
it than when they are operated on in the
ordinary way. This is a fact that has
been demonstrated by science, and the
time is probably coming when every well
rejrulatpd dairy will have its corps of paid
pipers."
T'nele Dudley, who owns a profitable
dairy a short distance from the city, was
not slow to act.
Undo Dudley went to a Scotch clothing
Ftore in town the next day and found
v. here he could hire a p!per who was out
of a job.
"I dunno," the old man said after he
had taken a long look at Sandy, "whether
you'd best come with them kind of clothes
on or not. Did you ever meet a cow when
you was dressed that way?"
"Hoot, mon! Gang awa'." replied thÂ»
piper, who was a native of Connecticut,
"grin I maun come this way, I won't come
at all."
He had once played the Laird In "Tril
by." but that was in happier days, before
Iiis thirst had become chronic. Now. the
"hlelacd" costume furnished by the clotn
lng company was the only suit he pos
sessed. His inclination to give it up was,
therefore, due to no inborn prejudice. '
"It ain't the bare less I'm thlnkin'
about specially," Uncle Dudley explained,
"but I thought mebby If you left off that
red petticoat and the shawl, i the cows
might give down better. It's all right,
though, if you can't play without 'em.
Come alonf. and we'll see how it works.
If this thing turns out proper, I'll prob
ably want to hire ' you by the month.
Couldn't you make It go all right with a
pair of them long golf stockin's on?"
The piper insisted that his costume was
ell it should be for the best results from
the pipes, nnd he arrived at the farm dur
ing- the next afternoon, when he was con
ducted through the sheds and barns by
Uncle Dudley.
"There," the old gentleman said, nod
ding at a barrel as they were passing
through the carriage-house, "is some of
the best hard cider in this county. Of
course. If you can't play as well without
the red petticoat, it's all right. Do they
take much to hard cider In Scotland 7"
"Well." replied the piper, forgetting his
dialect, "I never saw any over there."
Uncle Dudley explained how much sugar
and how many pounds of raisins were re-
quired to make a barrel of elder yield the
best results:, and then led the way to the
milking yard, where the piper was to ope
rate later in the day.
Â¦'I3o you have to have lees bare when
you're just learnln* the thing, too?" the
eld n'.r.n asked.
The piper explained that one might
learn it up to a certain point with trou
fotf on; and ether matters claiming Un
cle Dudley's attention, Sandy was then
left to amuse himself as he pleased. If
he had been watched he might have been
seen making frequent trips to the car
riajre house; but everybody about the
place was busy, and he therefore used his
long straw undisturbed.
Aunt Priscilla and her sister. Mrs. 'Wei.
don, who had been peeping around cor
ners at him without permitting them
selves to be seen thought Sandy remained
fa the vicinity of the cider barrel because
of a native modesty that he had not open-
Jy acknowledged.
"I sr'pose." said Uncle Jhidley's consort,
"he natchelly feels shy with his bare legs
around where he knows there's women. I
don't see why he can't put trousers on
when he ain't playin', though."
"Well," the other lady replied, "these
musicians are mostly eccentric one way
or another. You always hear of 'em
wearin' long hair or dressin' peculiar so
maybe this is just his way of bein' a
genius." *
Uncle Dudley had approached while
were discussing the subject, and he ex
plained that piping was an art that de-
Kianded bare knees. He had trustworthy
information to that effect, and scouted
h.s sister-in-law's theory.
"Seems kind of strange, though." Aunt
Priscilla said. "Pipers must have their
lungs in the same place other people have
ain't they?" â¢
Uncle Dudley didn't stop to discuss the
subject, but. ecing out to the carriage
house, he found Sandy sitting in the back
end of the spring wagon, with his bare
-!U S e own

Sar.dy grunted and began to pipe mourn
fully. ' .
â¢ "Or we could let you have a sheet or a
blanket, or something that would come
further down than the petticoat, If
thatâ"
The piper, emitted a blast that Uncle
Dudley interpreted as a sign of displeas
ure, and, returning to where the ladies
were, he said:
"Â¦\ye've cot to let him hare h!s own
way about this thing. It's wrong to in
terfere In professional matters a body
don't understand,' anyhow. I s'pose if we
hire him steady we'll get used to it In

The piper continued to imbibe hard elder
until mllklns time, when Uncle Dudley
found .him â¢ leaning against the barnyard
gate, laughing softly to himself. Tho
c6ws were driven up from the pasture,
and Pomeroy and the boys he had to help
him got their pails ready for action.

Presently the woman who waited upon

"A parcel? Oh!" ..

He bent down and kissed. her hands,

Of course, it was out of the question.
She would have to tell him. The letter
said that he was coming at 9 o'clock that
evening for an answer. Well, she mu.it

Oh, what was' the. good of going over
what she must be? She milst break- it
to him as gently, as she coula; that there

then she would not * probably see him

she ' added "Â¦ something ever" ' day, ha-1
grown large "enough to. pay back, in' me-e

So all the time that she was working

Mary" Kesteven's thoughts were; always
on the . same .errandâ were always ' thinn
ing, and cogitating, wondering and weary-
Ing for Jocelyn Musgrave.. .-'Â¦'â¢Â¦â¢ . .
Then came the letter from Willy Bran
don asking her to give up this daily to 1
for a jnere pittance: asking her, now that
she was a free woman and a decent in
terval had elapsed since the death of
her husband, to ..look upon him in a dif
ferent light to- what she had done hith
erto, asking her to become his'. wife "and
share his 'millions.
She Worked harder than ever, and ai
though it brought her in moneyâ tfo-i
money* which .would make her completely
freeâ her work was not such as to intei
est her or carry her out of herself. TherS
is nothing very exhilarating in polishing
the fingernails of a goddess; and most of
Mary Kesteven's clients were far from be
ing goddesses. There" is nothing satisfy
ing even in the most exquisitely scented
soap; while the powders and richest per
fumes, and hair washes, which were her
stcck in trade, were no, more than a
means to an end. They, did not interest
her in the very least. . â¢
bne was not ve-y happy at this time,
although her time' of penance had come
to an end. There was something in Bran
don's manner which made her uneasy;
there was something in Jocelyn MuÂ»
grave's letters. that made her heart pal
pitate every time that she thought abem*
him. It was nothing tangible, any more
than there was anything tangible in Bran
don's manner. She read his letters ove'
and over again. They were long, af
fectionate and kind; what was there that
made her so uneasy, that made her heart
so restless .,,and ofttimes like a piece of
molten lead within her breast? She could
not define it. and yetâ and yet it was so.
She lay there for a long time, thinking,
wondering:, cogitating, but arriving at no
satisfactory conclusion. And then the
m Â£, , w S? 1^ brin Sl n S her several- letters
which had Just come by the post. There
was one from Sir George Kesteven, mak
ing a technical inquiry for the purpose of
probate. There was one from her sister,
married happily but poorly In the far
north of England, and there was one from
Jocelyn Musgrave.
"I feel," he said, "that you have soma
special reason for remaining so long in
New York after all necessity to do so has
been done away with. Dear little woman,
at first when Lascelles Keateven was
takeaway I fancied that we should go
straight back onto the old terms againâ
that all impediment to our marriage was
removed. I did not like to put this very
plainly, because I have always been in the
habit of preserving a certain amount of
the conventionalities and the decencies of
life, but your continued absence has told
me, even better than the constrained lan
guage of your letters, that I have been
superseded. Well, dear little woman, this
makes my way more easy. I felt myself
all along bound in honor to you, but now
that more than six months have gone by
since you might reasonably have been ex
pected to return to England I may as well
confess to you that I am not the same
man who asked you to cut the knot of
your troubles by leaving Keateven for me.
I feel, therefore, that you will sympathize
with me when I tell you that I am going
' to be married next week ana that I am
under orders to go to South Africa within
a week of my marriage. This has been
rather hurriedly pushed on, first because
I did not feel myself free to speak on your
account", and therefore until a few days
ago the girl' to whom I am engaged had
no idea that I cared for her at all. You
will get this, -I have calculated, about
Easter day. I am going to be married on
Easter Tuesday. My fiancee's people live
a mile and a half from barracks. Be my
dear little woman once more, and send me
a line just to satisfy me that all Is right
on the morning of my marriage. Ever

So that had come to an end. Her eyes
had* been full of tears when the maid had
put the letters into her hand. They were
not full of tears as she came to the end
of Jocelyn Musgrave's explanation Oh
no, no! In the few minutes occupied In
reading his letter the scales had fallen

them in bewildered amazement, profound
amazement, at the depth and purity of

those pieces of paper; he had 3et her
free from all obligation to him that she
might lose no time in going back to her
own country and the man she loved. This
was love Indeed; true, pure, unselfish,
angelic love.
She fell back among her pillows, her
eyes full of tears, her mouth quivering.
"I have been on the wrong 1 track," sho
said to herself. "Not even Jocelyn loves
me like this. "What can I do? I can't
refuse them. I can't accept them. Oh,
if I were only free, I mean heart free,
that I might pay this man as he would

Yes, how angry he was! How angry!
She smiled happily as her thoughts wen:

She took a thin folder of Russian leather
Â¦with her monogram stamped in one corner
from her pocket. It only contained a
photograph and three or four letters.
From among these she selected one bear
ing a date of seven months previously, it
was written in a handwriting that was
bold and free: there was a regimental
crest on the top of -the paper.
"It is of no use." said Mary Kesteven
to herself, as her hand once more fell to

but it binds me no longer. He doesn't
know that I am waiting, waiting until
Jocelyn comes. He will be here now very
soon. I must read what his dear letter
says. Ah. it is more than six months
since I received it."
Presently she roused herself and read
the letter yet once again. It was manly,
frank, open, honest, breathing of love
such as any woman misrht be proud of.
It asked her, Mary Kesteven, to become
the wife of one of the richest men iu
America.
"It is of no use," she said to herself;
"it is the one thing I cannot do. I sup
pose I shall never make him understand.
It is natural, in a way, that he should
feel as he does; but, oh! how I wish he
felt any other way. He is so good, such
a brick, such a chum; he has 'been my
very salvation, and the one thing he asks

She did not explain the exact, state of
affairs in her subsequent letters to Jocelyn
Musgrave, because she was very proud
woman, and even of Â¦ Jocelyn she would
not like to seem to be asking a favor, and
he might feel himself bound Â¦ to offer to
lend her the money for the purpose . of
repaying Willy Brandon. ' So she simply
said in reply to. his letter that she would
not be able to. wind up her affairs in New
York for some few months. ;**f.*T?~<
**.t ter this Mary Kesteven felt that she
would rather die than ask the smallest
favor of her husband's brother. Â¦-.-.
She had been a widow for seven months
now. Her first instinct on hearing the
news of her husband's death, and the fact
that he had shown some sense of his
shortcomings by leaving the will which
he had made at the time of their marriage
unrevoked, had been to. return with grate
ful "words and a full acknowledgment, of
her enormous obligation, the money which
Willy Brandon had advanced to set- her
up In the business by which she had been
making her living. Then she had received
from her brother-in-law, who had been
the trustee under Major Kesteven's wi.l.'
an intimation that no money could be or
would be advanced until his brother's af
fairs were completely wound up.' "That
will certainly not be for some months to
come." he wrote to her. Then added:: "I
am sorry if this inconveniences you, but
as you say you have had no money from
my brother since you parted, and you
write from an exceedingly -good address
In New York, I conclude that you are not
in need, actual need, of funds. You need
not be afraid but that I shali fulfill my
trust to the utmost farthing, but it would
complicate matters were . I to send you
money at the present juncture; it would,
indeed, | really be advancing it" out of my
own pocket, which, remembering my own
responsibilities, I am not able' or willing
to do." V " .;, Â¦ ââ¢ â¢
It happened three "ears before this that
she had fled from her native country out
of the reach of her husband's iron hand,
Â¦when she had fallen upon very evil days,
and unless she had happened, as slie did,
to meet with Willy Brandon, she would
probably have starved in the streets of
New York. By sheer accident,' however,
she had been brought into contact with a
great millionaire. Nobody who knew
Willy Brandon, as he was affectionately
called by all sorts and conditions of peo
ple in all parts of the world, would have
been surprised had they known the chiv
alrous way in which he had taken up the
cause of the unfortunate girl who had
fled from her brutal husband. He had
given her no charity ..unless we call his
helpâ his timely helpâ by that name in the
higher sense of the word.
Well, six months had gone by. Death
had been merciful when it set her free
from the greatest brute that ever blasted
a woman's life.- Her first instinct had
fceen to sell up everything that she pos
sessed in New York and to go straight
back to her own country. But no, fate
came in and prevented any such end to
the story.
look, Â¦while Jocelyn Musgrravt vÂ»as Trait

that old love story in his hand, ready for
her to take up and weave into a golden,

THE TIME OF REMEMBERANCE
8fl 57 UNTING wild animals on a loco
n. motive instead of on horseback is
a novel form* of the . chase that
Â¦would even offer some hew kinds
of thrills to Vice President Roosevelt..
In the province* of Minas Geraes, a
mining region in Brazil, a hunt was con
ducted not long ago with the hunters rid
ing on a locomotive. The chase was after
gazelles, which were almost as fleet as
the lumbering locomotive that pursued
them. Only two gazelles were killed, but
the hunters had a much more exciting
experience . than they . had ever, had m
hunting in the ordinary manner.
One of the great amusements of the
Geraes region is the hunting of
antelopes in the extensive forests which
cover that section of Brazil. The hors-s
used, however, are of the small, degener
ate Brazilian, breed that are about as fast
as the ordinary street car horse and have
about as much ability to run down a-fleej
footed antelope as a grizzly bear has to
capture a cyclone.
For, that reason the antelopes', around
the mines had grown to be quite bold, and
often ' appeared near the railroad trade
and deSed every effort; of -the hunters t.-.
kill them.' "When they were pursued they
were in the habit of turning and running
straight down the , railroad track, 6n Â¦ the
level surface- of -which they could attain
their highest -speed, and soon leave the
hunters, horses and mules far behind.
Â¦ While discussing the matter, one day at
the mines it was proposed that as the an
| telopes - when : pursued generally ; ran
straight down the railroad track, itwou.'l
be a good ; idea â¢ to pursue them with Â¦ th'-j
mine locomotive. 'â¢' It was decided to haVo
the miners beat through the forest on the
morning, of the following.. Sunday and
drive as many of the antelopes as possi
bis toward "the tracks.' The locomotlvo
was .to run down the track at'daybreak
and - go in hot pursuit of every gazelle
that was foolish enough to continueKs
flight down the railroad track instead of
diving into the forest, a place where the
locomotive, for certain reasons of its own,
refused to follow them. - - â¢.
On the morning of the. hunt the engine,
with five hunters on the cowcatcher and
tender, steamed slowly down the track
until two gazelles were sighted. The en
gineer crowded. on as much steam as.pos
sible. The engine did not have'a full head
of steam on and the limit of speedcouM
not be reached. A fine . pairj'. of gazellts
we're on the track -in front of the engine,
but they kept } a good lead, and after a
chase of six miles nimbly turned aside
and disappeared. in the forest. 'Â¦-.., :
A few miles further on three gazelles
were found, but they also- kept well 'in
front of the pursuing; locomotive and out
of rifle shot,'; and after a longchase' they
also decided . to : gp into the' forest.. ) Â¦â¢
-By the time, the next pazelles were
lound the fireman had got a good head of
steam on the - engine, andO the Â¦ englnec*
cracked on full speed and gained â¢ rapidly
oiv the' fleeing quarry", and soon was bump
ing along [not; thirty, ' yards . behind ' the
antelopes. But .the great - speed-, on ' . tho
lumbering, old locomotive made . it pound
around like a ship in a gale. The hunte -s
could hardly hang on with both' hands,
let 'alone aim and : l1re.j _ : * .
- The engineer . slackened the speed some
what and the;; engine ran Â¦_ a. trifle' moi a
Bmbthly. Â¦.' The hunters hung on â¢ with one
hand, while 7 they raised "their rifles' tj
their shoulders with the other, . Five shut3
rang out simultaneously,'- but the'gasellis
only .waggled thelr_ bobtails in"a'provok
ing manner, and turning aside, sought tho
seclusion of the woods. . ' , â¢
* The' hunters "' were almost discouraged
and at the end of the line they received
any [ amount of guying ' from . the miners
assembled there. This resolved them to'
make another trip on the locomotive and
try again." ' 'â¢Â¦' ' , v"'- 1 ; ;â¢'.*:
After going a few miles four more ante
lcpes were found. TheÂ«engine raced along
at the highest notch of speed, and after
gettiner about twenty . yards , from ...the
quarry slowed down so - as not to bound
so much. All of the hunters fired at once
and one "gazelle was seen to jstagger, al
though it continued running in' the center
of the track.' ' : "
Another danger, presented Itself to tho
hunters.. If' the gazelle was to tumble
over ' the rails the engine was \ sure " to be
wrecked, as It was going at- almost -fuil
speed and could not be ' stopped short of
several hundred t yards. 'But just as the
engine -was close behind the wounded an
telope and the hunters were, about ready
to jump, the gazelle turned and stumbled
from the ; track and : died- six feet from
the rails. -/^
â¢;. Further " on the engineer " again . put the
hunters .within good rifle shot of thegame
and as> the j antelopes, left the 'track- for
the timber :: one "of their.' number fell;
pierced by two 'bullets fired by the hunt:
ers. This 'was all the game, secured, but
the .sportsmen "were salisSed.''; But -the
superintendent ; of. the 7 mine decided that
hunting antelopes with a locomotive was
a more : expensive ; and Â¦ dangerous â¢ pastime
than he' cared" to have^ his engines en
gaged' in, and so' he i put a. ban /on th}

THE origin of giving Easter eggs is
obscure. One theory is that the egg,
being emblematic of the beginning
of all things, was a fitting syno
nymy of the resurrection â the dawn
of a new life to mortals.
The egg is the germ of fecundity anÂ«l
abundance, so with the gift of a decorated
Caster egg we symbolically wish a
friend all the happy fulfillment of life's
expectances, contained in the fragilo
shellâ the one. aias! as easily and sudden
ly shattered as the other. ~--".-f*.
About the fourth century eggs were
prohibited by the church as a Lenten
diet. and. being more plentiful in th-i
spring than at any other time, there was
'such an accumulation at the end ot the
forty days that peasant and epicure werÂ«J
alike puzzled to contrive a way to dis
pose of them without loss. It Is sa'..1
some inventive mother converted them
into playthings for her children: henc3
the custom of boiling and coloring them.
The Easter egg. born of economy, has ev
oluted during the centuries till 1901 finds
It often a thing of extravagance and price.
Parisâ ever in excess*, be it pleasure, mis
ery or iavlshnessâ a few years . ago con -
ceived and executed a most beautiful
Easter offering for the Infanta of Spain.
Y. T ithln a delicate white porcelain shell
engraved with the gospel for Easter
nestled a tiny bird, which, upon tho
pressure of a cunningly devised spring,
came forth and sang twelve airs from
a3 many fashionable operas. This in
genious toy cost France 20,000 francs.
A French parent, presenting a scarlet
dyed Easter egg to a child, told him it
was a gift from Rome and bore the color
of the Cardinal's robe.
In those superstitious years English
and Irish nurses were careful to see that
their charges, after eating an egg, pushed
a. spoon through the shell . to prevent
witches from converting It into a boat. 7. '.
In France the same custom prevailed
In order to prevent magic or the black
art. It was declared that cabalistic char :
acters were often found on the inside of
egg fclaells, written by evil spirits. La
the same country trie largest and most
p ;rfect shaped eggs were h!ghly decorat
ed for offerings to the King.
On Easter morning at the conclusion of
mass lackeys brought pyramids of gilded
eggs to the palace and. after being bless
ed by the priests, they were distributed
to persons about the court. In some
parts of France it is still the custom for
priests to visit their parishioners aivl
bestow blessings, receiving in return
Easter eggs. - y : [i-A
Eggs are material, as well as poetical.
A French chef has Written a book on the
different, ways of preparing eggs for tlw
table.
They tempt the appetite of the rich,
replenish the blood cf the laborers, and.
hidden away by the farmer's wife and
daughter till a goodly number are gath
ered, are exchanged ''for many accessories
to their wardrobes.
How often have the eggs of the sea
bird kept shipwrecked ones from starv
ing!
Who has riot been Impressed with tha
pathos of the . passage of French hlstorv
-in: which we are- told that Marie An-.
tolnette, on one occasion when' a pris
oner, "to keep up an appearance of cou â¢*
age before her children, too.; two fresti
eggs from the' food set before them?"
From Germanyâ rich in weird tradi
tionsâcomes the quaint conceit that the
week before Easter rabbits are endowed
with the power to lay eggs. Young chil
dren, believing ti.e fantasy, watch in the
fields . for- rabbits, and when the startlt-l
creatures, seeing them, run, follow in
their track, . shouting "the nattering en
treaty, "Go, pretty rabbit, sweet rabbit,
and lay me a nest cf red Easter eggs."
In solid comfort-loving but thrifty and
prufent Germany the Easter, eggs for
sale in shop windows, though often nov<Â»i
in device and brilliant in coloring, rare.y
exceed in price two or. three gulden.
In Italy the peasants rejoiced in the be
lief that during- the chiming of the" bells
on Easter ' morning : angels with ? azure
wings descended ; and placed baskets of
colored eggs' in the homes, of the faithful.
Champion Small Writer
off World Has. Retired.
OILA KITTREDGE of Belfast,
champion small writer of tho
ii world, has retired from the field.
leaving his record of 46,000 words
written with a common steel pen on an
ordinary postal card for ambitious micro
scopic penmen to equal or beat. Up to
two years ago he wrote a great deal, but
now, being within a /ew months of 80,
he has given up the laborious practice of
writing volumes upon small cards, his
hand- being less steady and hl3 eya lesa
bright than in his best days.
Mr. Kittredge has long been famous for
his penmanship. ' He is a Vermonter by
birth. . His practice of miniature chlrog
raphy began early in* life and many
a time he has gone without dinner rather
than leave unfinished a piece of work.
His first serious competitive effort was
made in 1887, when some one sent to the
Belfast Journal a postal card upon which
600 words had been crowded, and defied
any one to beat it. A few day3 afterward
Kittredge handed in a postal card upon
which he had written 1000 words, and this
being beaten he produced one with 3000
words.
The . 3000- word postal card ended the
competition, but Mr. Kittredge kept on
crowding his letters and words Into still
smaller space, turning out in succession
cards .bearing 6000, 10,000 and 20,000 words.
His finest work was done In 1SS3, when he
wrote 46,000 words upon an ordinary
postal card, and the entire text of the
New Testament, about 181,000 words, upon
four postal cards.
He has written several Presidential in
augural addresses upon postal cards and
has always considered It easy to write the
Lord's prayer eight times within the
space covered by a five-cent nickeL Ha
wrote one of Gladstone's speeches upon a
postal card and sent it to the statesman,
who wrote a letter in reply, thanking Mr.
Kittredge and praising his skill..
Mr. Kittredge never used any magnify
ing glasses or other aids. He has always
worn a pair of ordinary spectacles, such
as most elderly men use, and all his
writing has been done with an ordinary
steel pen and common black ink. He has
competed with many would-be champions
who have used magnifying glasses and
sharp-pointed hard lead pencils, and he
has Tasily beaten them all, in spite of
their advantage in the matter of equip
ment.
His writing Is distinguished by Its
beauty and the artistic arrangement and
uniformity of the letters. Each letter 13
separate and distinct. â¢ and some framed
specimens were Â¦ shown at the Paris Ex
position. He says that his eyes naturally
magnify.
ueaux and sold in London for three hun
dred guineas to a traveler was exhibited
as a great mystery, for it bore on the
shell in plain white letters an Inscription
in French, which, translated, read, "Na
poleon Bonaparte will reascend the throne
of France November 15. ISIS." Since the
art of lettering eggs with chemicals has
become generally known the .mystery Is
lost in the presumption that it was the
work of some ingenious Yankee.
To-day In America Easter is exten
sively observed by the exchange of elab
orate cards and gifts and a labored dis
play of Easter finery. Who would brave
criticism and go to church and take part
in the Resurrection praise service of one
who suffered so many, many years ago,
and Is so far. off, in hats and dresses worn
through the winter?
The, grounds of the White House In
Washington are gay on Easter morning
with children, who assemble to roll eggs
down a terrace.
For children whose parents can afford
to buy them there ore innumerable beau
tiful "novelties, while the mother with
small means and abundance of love can,
as in times gone by, purchase a few
cents' worth of colored calico or dye and
boil the eggs till they are so brightly
colored that the sight of them, on Easter
morn will give her children an equal
pleasure with the children of the rich.
Â¦ The . varied Imagery in the Easter dis
play is a study. From the small end of
crystallized sugar shells wreathed in flow
ers one sees a miniature landscape or
ships, all sails set, .resting on tiny blue
oceans. Looking into an imported affair
of ostrichlike dimensions we have before
us a group of Alpine peasants clothed In
red,^purple and .orange, celebrating an
EasteV festival on the < village green.
In imitation of real "eggs are what are
known as filled eggs, which, opening in
the middle, disclose a shepherd guard
ing his flock or a fairylike bower, where
lovers are . apparently exchanging vows
of eternal constancy. Unconscious su
gared irony! Are not lovers' vows, like
the shell of an egg, easily, broken?
One might describe indefinitely the
Easter offerings for sale in the stores of
our own city. Mythology nor the "Arab-
Ian' Nights" entertainment has not,re
corded such wonderful results as the pro
ductions of mortal man to commemorate
the Resurrection. .Even, the moon is re
membered and the face of the mysterious
man who Inhabits It beams a saccharine
smile on the throngs at the windows. .
"The egg la Indeed the beginning of all
thingal What child has not delighted. ia
and ; remembered always the rhymes of
which. the egg Is the theme, and laughed
at J the : predicament â¢ of Hurnpty Dumpty
or rejoiced with the old owner of the
black hen who laid' eggs for gentlemen? '
Â¦ â¢ Easter is essentially the children's day.
God bless them as they carry their Easter
"Offerings down the aisle of the church to
lay : them at ftie foot of the cross. You
who .-' are above want remember in

nourished little children with pale faces,
"whose preternaturaily large eyes would

basket^of colored eggs : had been placed

mysterious manner. It Is *in your power

themselves will have a greater value.
Remember this, and when, clothed in.
Easter garments, you" sit on the. soft
cushions ot some fashionable church and
listen to the glorious faster music, with,
the Easter sun of 1901 streaming down
lipon you through stained glass window3
as you echo the refrain of the trained
choir, "He Is Risen, Indeed," the "peace
that passeth all understanding 1 ' will glide
Into your hearts and remain with you

DAME FASHION'S DECREE FOR
TASTEFULLY GOWNED
WOMEN
THE new frocks are a decided
credit to that domineering Mis
tress of the Modesâ Dame Fashion. -
Of course, she has borrowed
.some of her best notions" from the
styles of the past, but at the same time
she has modified ' and * modernized them,
until they actually appear something very
new and very novel. ,
.To be sure, the colors remain practically
the same, only now and then some devia
tion is made. This year the favorite colors
are blue, in many shades, all equally swell
and staple black and -white. \
English people like to think that Lon
don is responsible for this fashion, and
doubtless the. death of the Queen did go
a long way toward it. A woman In Lon
don would : be dreadfully conspicuous if
she had on any color, and Paris. isn't so
far "away, you know, and it's no use try
ing to deny that Paris leads us about by
the nose when it comes to frills and fux
â¢belcws. . â¢ Â¦â¢-â¢.â¢.' Â¦ *Â¦ .. -
V. The everlasting- Easter problem has
about been solved. Tailor suits are al
ways the proper thing, and particularly
-so this season, as they are very much
dressed up and have no end of white, red
'and gold on them that gives a general air
of rejoicing.
.One of the newest things is a costume
of black and pale gray. | People found out
last summer that white was needed more
than > fashion allowed, but this* year the -
I colors are all light and the materials very
. sheer. '
The latest Parisian novelty is the prin
cesse. It is very, very noticeable and
likewise very, very swelL The skirt is
long and has a black velvet ribbon run
' through a lace insertion about four inches
from the ground. Of course, only a per

tempt to wear one, and even then it must

minutes to work; on. It may be trimmed

Somewhere in the midst of these leaves
lies half-hidden a gold and turquoise
buckle that you seem to discover by ac
cident- Virot has pinched the stmw
crown with another of these buckles.
The pink hat from the Marescot Soeurs
is made for some wedding trousseau. No
body on earth but a bride could wear it
lor all it is worth. It is made of illusion
z.T'.d there is a good' deal of suggestion
in the name of its material. You know
It won't last but it is a rosy flight of
fancy while it still lives. Perhaps, after
all, it Isn't exactly kind to say that it
is made for a bride. .
The illusion is of dainty rose pink, laid
in pleats and folds that twirl around . the
crown as well as the brim. Three wreaths
of little round, fat pink roses follow the
circles, and under the brim are caught
three big pink roses. Not a hint of an
other color appears anywhere.
The flat crown is not to be found. Pan
cakes are extinct. Crowns are high and
irregular in form. Some are not really
crowns at all, but masses of chiffon or
crushed straw plaques that give the re
quired height.
One of the smartest high ; hats is a
brown straw placjue. A smaller plaque
of tan straw is bent into a flowerpot shape
that serves for crown. A mass of blue
chiffon is cut into th-e infinite number
of pleats that Paris natience alone takes
the time to stitch around and around "ani
around between the . cords of the' straw.
A great blue satin bow with wings spread
lies under the brim.
The wonderful . currant hat from Ca
mil'.e Roger is the only so-called "flower
hat" in the collection. It happens . to bo
made of leaves and berries, for that mat
ter, but that is all the sar^e in millinery
parlance- Narrow rolling brim and high
crown are entirely jiade of the wine-re 1
currants and- their 'eaves of .the same
shade, and Â¦ these are ; softened by a veil
of deep red illusion. A" huge velvet bow
Is the. only, trimming. It is .of the new
shade called currant red. "a j shade . that
can no â¢ more be Â¦ described than can Â¦ that
of the fruit itself. One gold buckle, the

Mrs. Gage has returned from her semi
annual Paris trip with boxes that VIrot
filled and others that bear the stamp of
the Marescot Soeurs and Camille Roger.
These geniuses have ' scattered neatness,
primness, order arid trimness to the four
winds this year and have conceived and
carried out the rashest ideas that even
Paris ever dared.
The day of the delicate pastelle shades
Is at hand. "With a few~Â« exceptions the
new colors are strong and boldly con
trasted. Lemon yellow mates with white
or black; scarlet is buckled with gold:
turquoise blue is wreathed in grass green.
The faded shades that might have come
out of a grandmother's trunk have given
way to gayety.
Black and white are strongly in evi
dence. One of these hats, a Virot for
evening wear, is all made of white illu-
Eicnâ row upon row of it, fluff upon fluff
of it. The making is done in a curious
â¢way and must have cost somebody more
stitches than several times its price
â¢would ever pay for. Long strips of the
illusion are gathered in every few inches
and belted with a oar.d of black velvet rib
bon; countless of these strips are needed
to cover the large frame of the hat. It
is as tip-tilted as all the rest of the new
patterns are, and the space at the left
Fide where the form turns up is filled in
Â¦with black velvet. So in most of the
hats, for that matter, whatever their ma
terial and color.
The trimming 1 is as simple as usual.
Two plumes are the amount of it; a long,
sweeping white plume curves from the
front along the side and 'underneath Is
tucked a short black tip.
Another of Virot's fancies Is a huge
turquoise blue straw that probably
started out .to be a plaque, but was
crushed beyond recognition. It tilts up
here and down there in the most rakish
and irresistible fashion. Under the. brim,
close against the, hair. . nestles a wreath
of tf-Â»- '-''-'-+ <~r-ci>Ti leaves, as tiny and

And she answered, "I will, ii he has," n

seemed to. know: .1 tried to, find the

Dane. ' Hurried and worried as I was 1

and. I said to myself, "If I- coulc

around me and Hoboken growing smaller

The purser had hivherto' been" hiddon

all- It will be seen that I am philcsophS

He was busy finding places at -table for
various passengers who were besieging
him, but he said politely, in his idiom:
"Ah. that is .too badly- But ycu" wi!l
make friends on the voyage."
"J3ut I'm not going, you know. I'm go â¢
ing back with the r pilot." '
The purser stared at me as if he
tiiought J was a lunatic and several of
the passensers turned and looked at mÂ»i
with amused interest. *
"The pilot departed already a half-hour

But the purser said:- "You Â¦will make
the return trip on thb steamer. She will
be back in four weeks.".',
He.seemed to think that it was quite an
â¢ordinary thing for a. man to get "carried
off to. Europe by. mistake. " '-'Â¦â¢ ' ,
"But I have only- five dollars with me.'.
I didn!t come to go. I mean I came to go

So much by way of preamble. Last

"An Eastern Easter," being a seriour
poem of some length The first copy cam;
to me while I was out and my sister Mar
cell?, opened it and then v left it lying on
the center table in the parlor. An hour
or two later I came home arid found it
there, and without s-tepping to look at it
â for I hrid airead" reen a copy at Biy
publisher'sâ I wrapped it up and ran
around the corner to give it to my- dear
friend. Eros Pan?, who was to-sall next
day for Europe on the Holl and America
line.
He was so awfuliy busy packing that
he did not open it either, but told me
that it would be h:s first pleasure after
the vessel started iÂ» read the booi, and
he would then write me a long, critical
t letter. Dane has been one of mv kindest
and yet one of my severest critics, anl
it is due to him that I ventured 'upon
writing so serious a poem as "An Eastern
Easter." which I may say, without^ of
fense, is modeled aftor Sir Edwin Arnold's
"Light of Asia." . I 0
I was a little disappointed that Enos
did not open the package; Â»s I thought
that they had hound the book, very pret
tily, and I like his judgment on such mat
ters; and 1 Â¦wouldn't have minded, to tell
the truth, if he had a?ked me to read the
first hundred stanzas or so. There are
seven hundred in all, eight lines to a
Ftanza, very easily Rowing, if I do* say
it. But that has nothing to do with what
followed. ...>^y
The next morning Uncle, Bob dropped in
Â¦while we were at breakfast, and from the
twinkle in his eye I knew that he; had
been up to one of his "benevolences," as
we call them m the family. .
"Rather nice book of 'poems that .of
yours," said he
"Oh. have you seen It?" I said, for I did
not suppose the stores- would have ex
posed it for tale so ucoh.
"Yes, 1 saw your copy yesterday after
noon. Thought I'd give it a send off.
Didn't you find the buokmarks?" 'r/v
"Bookmarks? No, " I said. "I have
hardly looked at the book, for I wanted
Dace to have the nr&t copy. You know
he suggested my writing the poem." . -
My uncle's expression changed. "Do
you mean you have given the book away
without looking -it it?" said he. hurriedly.
"Yes, I took it round to Dane last night.
You know he sails for Europe this morn-
Insâ"
"Why. man. I put ten bills of a thou
sand each in it just for a starter to bring
you good luck."
"Oh, you jewel of an uncle!" cried I,
g-lanclng at the clock.
I remember that my feeling of gratitude
was mixed up with a v.ish that he had
chosen a more conventional way* of mak
ing the gift.- Jt was 9 o'clock and the
Milldam sailed at 10. I had noticed that
in the paper that morning.
I sprang from the table. an<3 saying "I
m'jst get that book," I was gone like a
Phot, stopping oniy to pick up my hat.. 1
live in Harlem, and I had a little over an
hour to get to the company's docks at.
Hobcken, on the other side of the Hudson
River. I took an elevated train down to
Twer.ty-third street.
I may as well admit that I was" not at''
that time so well blessed wtih this world's
soods that I could hazard the loss" of ten
thousand dollars without an effort. Dane
"light look at the book up on deck -and
turn a page that concealed the bills just
*n time to catch a passing breeze, . and
then where would my money be? -U
At Twenty-third street I hailed a cab. *"â¢
a "d promised the man five dollars if he
would get me to the Holl pier ten minutes
before the boat sailed. I happened to
have ten dollars in my pocket or I would
have been in a fix. â¢ â¢' â¢-
There were no incidents connected with *
my getting to Hoboken. and. I. arrived
there in time, paid my man and rushed
up the gangplank. There I found every
thing ia confusion. I did not know the
bacx? cut, tell me. didn't .you. really
mean to come?" Then she looked me all
over, the way ? woman will, and, I could
see- that she was thinking: "He is a little
too. well dressed to be a stowaway."
When" I am perturbed I have a way of
getting mixed up in my. speech. "Why,
y6u see, I came after.' Mr.' Dane's $10,000
that I had in his bookâ tfcat is,- my untie.'
npt $10,000 in Mr. . Dane's new bookâ that

."To get the book back?" --Â¦. .Â¦ â¢
- "No,- to get the money back; and ' Mr.
Dane wasn't on board, because he didn't
go^y this line, and so here I am."
\. Miss Delplainâ for .this*' as I afterward
learned, was her name; Miss- Dorothy Del
plain of Philadelphiaâ stared atÂ« me as, if
she thought, I. was not quite right, and -
Just then the purser and the captain came
up. ~
"Here he is," said the ( purser.
.Captkin Zollikoffer was a. red-cheeked,
jolly looking fellow. . "What is this you*
have done?" cried he. "Did you come to
sae'some one off?" , Â»
Â¦Â¦"No," said I, "1 didn't come to see him
off, because I'd seen him off last j nightâ
that Â¦ is, I bade him. 'good-by last night;
but, you see, I. gave him a copy of my lat-'

eveivsaw.- He Immediately called his first
sfflcicr and told him to get the megaphone
und ask < the first 'officer of the other
steamer whether. Mr. Dane was on board.
Before the first-; officer could , get the
megaphone, the man began looking at me
;arnestly'through'.-a"palr of field glasses..
[ ran to Miss Delplain, who was sitting '.
svith her. mother. . "Come," said I, excit

As we reached the'first officer, he called
iut: "Is Mr. Dane of New York on board

The man who looked like Dane nodded
lis head, and the first ofllcer of the other
iteanier, who heard the noarse "blast of.
he megaphone, nodded also and picked
ip an â¢ old-fashioned speaking trumpet,
such. as. fire chiefs use. "Yes," said he;
'who wants him?," 'â¢
The first officer turned to me, and I said:
'Let me take the niegaphone.". Then I
Mit'it to my lips and shouted: "My uncle

The next minute the somewhat muffled
tones of Mr. Da"ne came through xhe
trumpet to usâ and by us. I mean all the
passengers who could crowd around. Ha
eald. "I opened the book In a pretty stiff
, 'â¢ breeze â do you hear?"
â¢J' "Yes. yes." I shouted. In an asony of
expectancy: "go on."
"I cpened the book in a galeof wind."
".he repeated. Dane always was a great
hand to repeat unnecessarily. "And a bill
blew away to' sea/'
Miss Delplain's hand sought- mine and
squeezed it â¢sympathetically. Just then
Dane was seized with a fit of sneezing,
and he had to Interrupt his narrative. It
seemed an age before he ceased his vocal
1 spasms. Â¦ At last he went on.
"I shut the book up,- then went Into my
cabin snd found nine other bills of a thou
sand eftch. Are they yours?"
â¢'Yes, 1 ' - 1 shouted.
_, "Have you much of a library?" said he.
;-. â¢â¢T'hat was the only book of the kind."
â¢ f Thcn he wanted' to know how I came to
be on board_ thV Milldam. and how the
money . came * to be 'In 'the book.. I ex
plained everything to him, and asked the
.captain whether I could go after my for
, tune or whether he could send sailor. I
was" rather 'relieved when . he "detailed a.
sailor to straddle one of the hawsers and
'go after. the money: and I was so afraid
that he would falk overboard on the way
back. They never could have recovered
him: and he was so valuable. But he
made the return trip in safety and band
ed me a neat package. - My eyes met those
of Miss Delplain, and (knew that my
ocean trip was going to be. good for me.
. I opened the package while my friends
crowded around me, and there were the
nine bills. I could not blame Dane for
the loss of the tenth, but I've often won
dered since whether it washed ashore at
any of the beachÂ«s. What, a beautiful lit
tle romance a man could make out of it!
But my own romance^ was good enough
for. me for the pypsent. . I asked Mrs. Del
plain's consent that evening, and in the
course of conversation It" turned out that
she was a schoolmate, of 'my mother, so,
of qo'ursG, she had not the slightest objec
tion to my marrying Dorothy.
While I was talking to 'her a brilliant
thought came into my ,head, v Induced by
what struck me as a curious coincidence.
/We had been at sea just a .week, and It
.was the day before Easter. ,
" "Would it.nbt be a happy augury for
the success of my book. Mrs. Delplain?"â
somehow I- courd talk* to the mother with
out getting all tied . up â "would it not be a
happy augury f^r the success of my '.East
em Easter' If Tve-were married on Easter
day?". <; . .-â¢ -
Mrs. Delplain, who is a Baptist and not
up in the. Episcopal time table, said she
thought it would; and then the bugle
sounded -for dinner,.: and as., she had her
sea appetite on she went down without
saying anything further.
As / fÂ«r me, having obtained her consent.
I went at once to. the Rev." Charles W.
Opdyke of Philadelphia, who, as luclc
would have it, was one of the passengers:
and I told him of the good fortune that
was to be mine and asked him If he would
unite in the bonds on Easter day. He said
that with the captain's consent nothing
would give' him greater pleasure. He al3O
said that it was a little unusual to be
married on Sunday, but that he did 'not
see any objections to it. " 'The better the
daly the betterthe deed.* when a deed is
so good as this," said he. Then I went to
Â¦ Â¦Â¦â :._Â¦ ,. â¢_â¢ .:Â¦"Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦.... ' Â¦*: ~i--f:.
sail the captain. o
"*"Why, most surely." said he. "I will
have the cook make a Wllhelmina cake
in honor of the occasion. Such an uncl?!"
It. seemed hard for him to get over my
uncle.
Then it suddenly occurred to me that I
had not told Dorothy about the date. It
would be awkward if she learned it from
another passenger.
She was, sitting with her mother In the
ladies' saloon. "Dorothv," said I, "let ma
"congratulate you. You are to be marrici
..next; Sunday." --â¢Â£Â¦â¢
." Several, passengers looked up' in aston
ishment and Dorothy blushed a delightful
shade of red. But before she could-spealc
her 'mother said: '/Next Sunday? Why,
you, :~told me that ' you wa'pted to marry
her oh Easter Sundav."
Dear Baptist woman, she had. supposed
dimly that Easter came some time in the
fall. But she was true-blue. I told her
"that I did not believe, *in long engage
ments, and that If we .waited for Kaster
to fall in the autumn we'd both pass away
unwedded, and then she said: "It's allthe
same. If you are to be my son-In-l^w, the
sooner the better."
Do you. know that then for the first time
I realized that she would be t my mother
in-law, and It gave me. a bit of a shiver,
but-only." because- the professional Jokers
have said so much on the subject. I really
had no cause for worry, and I leaned over
and was Just going to kiss her when I re
membered the other passengers, and I
didn't d.o It. . I*
I tried to get Dane to be my best manv
but- he is light-headed, and said that he
wouldn't come over the hawser for a,
-whole -book full of bank bills; but he
wished me every sort of Joy._ I had sent,
him a note explaining what was going ta
happen. â¢';â¢.'.
But. as It turned out, he was best manâ
at a distance â after all. Kaster morning
dawned, beautiful, and springlike. "We*
were married In the stern of the yesselâ
really on the steerage deck, under an
awning, for no reason In the world but
that Dane could be near us and act as
best man from the bow of the Humbug
liner.
I hadn't seen Dorothy look so beautiful-
since we left Hobokenâ never, in fact. She*
was dressed In some kind of gTay clotbi
frock, and I had borrowed a coat, alsof.
a frock, from a man not much bigger than
I, and I wore a collar that Master Eddys
Â¦Hoch of Cincinnati lent me. It was de-~
cldedly the best fit of any I had tried on
since my own became undesirable.
I gave Dorothy one of the bills as a wed- 7
ding present, and I think that that added?
" to -her. happlnesa. Â»"I jfeel that I can say 1 
this without -detracting from my own
merits. She felt more comfortable coming 11
to me not entirely dowerlesa.
a It was the event of the voyage as far as"
:the rest of the passengers were concerned
âand, in fact, as far as we ourselves were
concerned.
Â¦' When we debarked at Boulogne *I>ane;
\ and Mrs. Delplain accompanied us on a'
short wedding trip to Paris.
.Uncle Bob had evidently surmised that,
rl'had been carried off. for when Dana
went to his banker's ttere was a , cable'.

Report Tnat Famous Gainsborough
Painting Has Been Found Is
Viewed With Skepticism.
The report from the East that the fam

of Devonshire bad been found In Chicago
has created no end of discussion. Wheth
er the original has been found is still a
conjecture. .
Charles Becker, alias '.'The Dutchman,"
the world-notorious forger, now serving a
term at San Quentin, and who la supposed
to know where the famous painting is,
said yesterday:
"They, think that they have the original,
but'they have not," and refused to make
any further statement.
i A member of the firm of Messrs. Agnew
of London, who is here, said: "This is
the eleventh time the picture has been
found, and I am afraid that this will turn
out to be like all former recoveries^â a dis
appointment. The only news "we have is
a cable from Moreland Agnew stating that
he "had* succeeded in buying a Gainsbor

The decision first quotes the articles of

tion that section 12 provides for a life ten

of article XX of the State constitution.
. The decision contains the following:
Our conclusions are that these sections of
article XIII of the charter, which provide for
Â¦ the method , of. appointment, are not insepar
; ably., interwoven Â¦â¢ with section ' 12, Â¦ which deals
with removals: that those sections ' stand as

city and county of San Francisco
was decided yesterday by the Supreme
Court, which held that the rules of the
commission do not apply to the deputies
mentioned.
The cases decided by the Supreme Court,
sitting in bank, were as follows: Timothy
C". Crowley, plaintiff and respondent, vs.
J. Richard Freud et al., defendants and
appellants; S. Cahen, plaintiff and appel
lant, vs. Asa R, "Wells, Auditor, etc., de
fendant and respondent, and A. C. Bauer,

The cult of Crowley against Freud et al.
,Tva6 brought in the Superior Court to re
. strain the Civil Service Commission from
expending public money for holding ex
aminations of candidates for positions as
deputies in county offices, while in the two
other cases referred to suits were brought
In the lower court to restrain Auditor
TVells from drawing and paying any war
rant in payment of salary of the Civil
Service Commission, or for any expense
of the commission, on the ground that all
provisions of the charter on the subject of
civil service are unconstitutional and void.
Crowley secured judgment In the lower
court, and this ruling was affirmed yester
day In the Supreme Court. In the other
cases, which attacked the existence of the
Civil Service Commission, a general de
murrer was sustained in the lower court,
which judgment was sustained yesterday
by the appellate body. . .
The decision in the case of Crowley vs.
Freud et al. was written by Justice Mc-
Farland and was concurred In by Justices
Harrison, Henshaw and Garoutte. A dis
senting opinion was written by Justice
Van Dyck and concurred In by Justice
Temple and Chief Justice Beatty.
In giving its decision the court first
dwells on the ruling of the lower court,
which held that the consolidated munici
pal government of San Francisco had no
power, through its Civil Service Commis
sion, to prescribe the qualifications of
deputies of county officers, such as Sheriff,
County Clerk and Recorder.
No Power Over County Officers.
As to whether such power exists, the
court said:
The power in . Question does not exist unless
It la granted in that clause of section 8Â»$ of
article XI of the State constitution, adopted
In 1SS6. which Is as follows: "Where a city
and county government has been merged and
consolidated into one municipal government. It
shall also be competent in any charter framed
under said section 8, of eaid article XI, to
provide Icr the manner in which, the times at
which and the terms for which the several
county officers shall be elected or appointed,
for their compensation and for the number of
deputies that each ehall have, and for the
compensation payable . to each of such
deputies."
The contention of the Civil Service Com
mission, the appellants, that "there is no
. such thing as 'county officer* " in the
boundaries of the city and county of San
Francisco is briefly reviewed by the Su
* preme Court, which holds that "county
officers" do exist in this municipality and
that they are recognized by the section
. <of the Stats constitution above quoted.

stated that the Japanese Government had
decided that Russia's reply concerning
Manchuria was unsatisfactory and that
a peremptory j remonstrance, amounting
practically to an ultimatum, would be de
livered to Russia. Â¦-. Â¦ â¢ â¢ 4
This appeared to refer to Russia's latest
declaration. But on examination it is
clear that it could not have referred to
the latest Russian declaration, as this
was not sent to the powers until Thurs
day night after the warlike dispatch was
sent out from Japan.
This leaves open the question of Japan's
policy on the case as now presented by
Russia and removes, the impression that
she has peremptorily rejected the Russian
statement. The Japanese and,.- Chinese
Ministers - were at the State Department
to-day. They came, however, in, quest
of information Â¦ and to discuss the general
aspects. of the situation- i

Under , these circumstances the deputa
tion is naturally perplexed how to avoid
giving utterance to the sentiment upper
most in Roman Catholic minds in connec-.
tion with royalty and at the same timo
frame an address not replete with mean
ingless platitudes. Since the war broke
out the- public expressions of Cardinal
Vaughan have given great offense to ths
majority of Roman Catholics in England
who are Irish born. They have taken
the position that . this auestlon is one of
politics and not religion and hence are
opposed to the Cardinal's views.
A leading Catholic paper, the Catholic
Times, is outspoken in declaring that the
coronation oath. Is one which under all
circumstances should be subjected to pro
test wherever a public expression of Cath
olic opinion is made, and should the dep
utation leave out a reference to this sub
ject the result may put to a Bevere test
the loyalty of the lay Catholics toward the
Cardinal.
LONDON. April 6.â A deputation of Ro
man Catholics who will visit the King
next week to present an address have a
rather delicate problem to face. The text
of all addresses must be submitted for
royal approval before presentation for the
double purpose of preventing any false
note and at the same time of. affording
to royalty an opportunity for framing an
appropriate answer.

The case "of Frederick W. Beyer of Gera,
formerly a large Importer and dealer In
American meals, who was ruined by the
local authorities rendering his trade im
possible, is now in the highest land court
at Jena, -which has decided. that the State
does not owe Beyer the damages of 50,000
marks which he claims. Beyer will carry
the case to the imperial court at Leipsic.
The German press comments unfavor
ably on the farewell speech ' of C. P.
Bryan, United States Minister to Brazil
at Port Allegra, in which Mr. Bryan was
quoted as counseling the German resi
dents of Brazil to contribute to the wel
fare of that country without wounding
the national sentiments of the Brazilians.
A letter in relation . to this matter from
a prominent German of Rio de Janeiro
is making- the rounds of the press. This
letter says Mr. Bryan's words were tact
less and that the American Minister in
terfered in matters which did not con
cern him, and denies that Germany seeks
political Independence for the German
residents in Southern Brazil.
The fact of the matter is that the Em
peror's utterances have been interpreted
in all ways, to suit everybody's taste and
partyism. .
The paper then dissects the Emperor's
toast concerning Russian-German rela
tions, and says it is evident that some
body Is systematically trying to embroil
these hitherto friendly relations, and that
from the Emperor's hints this can only be
Great Britain or Japan. The paper con
cludes:
"Where on -earth are our new English
friends?" -
The Cologne Volks Zeitung says Em
peror William's words to the Emperor
Alexander Grenadier. Regiment upon the
occasion of their Installation In their new
barracks near the - Emperor's palace,
when he called them his life guards, have
been received everywhere with - dismay
and amazement, but sadder still is the
fact that the Emperor had the regiment's
barracks built In close proximity to the
castle, which shows that the Emperor
meant what he said upon that occasion.
BERLIN, April 6.â The entire German
press Is still greatly excited over the Em
peror" a recent utterances, on the occasion
of his toasts and the reviews in' to-day's
weekly press confirm -this condition.
Governor Allen Says the
Rule of Uncle Sam Is
Agreeable.
When asKed about tha' alleged unpopu
larity of the Hollander tax law Governor
Allen explained that there was naturally
much misunderstanding i about the inau
guration of . the pureiy American "system,
of taxation, . based upon property valua
tions, to take the place of the old Spanish
system that had been. lr vogue for over
300 years. He said that the total valuation
of the property in Porto Rico would be
close to $100,000,000 and under the law bur
one-half of l'per cent, it is believed, couM
be levied for municipal purposes and the
same for insular purposes. This would re
tire about $1,000,000. The other million
necessary to make .op the total budget
would be raised by excise taxes on rum,
cigars, cigarettes, etc.
Governor Allen explained that the corn
plaint made against the features , of. the
Hollander -law, which enly allows six
months -for the. redemption of property
sold for taxes, was one that could be. rem
edied . . by the > next LegislatU'-e, which
meets In December, Â«f thp time was found
to be too short. -Governor Allen said that
the taxation under the Hollander law was
lower J than -. In any of . the States of this
country. , '-;
Causes of the Complaints.
I believe that Senator Foraker bullded more
wisely than he knew in the organic - law cov
ering the island, and I feel, after a somewhat
ultimate acquaintance with the situation, that
that law Itself, interpreted In the spirit in
which it was made, will be found to work
quite satisfactorily In Porto Rico for some
time to come. Â¦
In the old established Industries In Porto
Rico there has been a great improvement in
all except coffee growing and production. Un
fortunately, this is languishing at the present
time. The production of sugar has been in
creased from 40,000 tons last year to probably
100.000 tons estimated for this year. The sugar
industry is bound to flourish, owing to the
tariff discrimination in its favor. Upon the
crop estimated for this year the Porto Rlcans
will save $3,500,000 In tariff duties. The orange
Industry is being increased by the Investments
of Americans. The fruit is delicious and there
Is plenty of land to be had for the cultivation
of oranges.
Recently persons who are Interested in the
growing of lilies and other flowers, as well
as onions and potatoes In Bermuda, have been
looking over the Island with a view to trans
ferring to Porto Rico the agricultural Indus
tries that have made Bermuda famous. A
faint idea of what this would met a to the
islands can be gathered from the far ttat last
year this country Imported fronr Iwmuda.
400,000 bushels of onions alone.
The civil government established In Porto
Rico Is working smoothly. â¢ The various de
partments have been organized and our . ad
ministration is seemingly giving general sat
isfaction. In a- material way there has been
wonderful progress. Most of the land . which
was not under cultivation under the old regime
is being taken up and being made profitable.
There is a great field in the island for products
that' can be shipped to the United States,, es
pecially - oranges and other fruits. The ad
vantages possessed by the Porto Rican fruit
growers, on account of the discrimination in
their favor as far as tariff duties are con
cerned, which will be Increased when all duties
are removed July 1, cannot but result In mak
ing It a great fruit growing country.
Conditions in the Island.
Speaking about the affairs of the island
Governor Allen said that the situation
had Improved very materially In every
way. since he ' became Governor over a
year ago. He said further:
It ia pretty well understood that Gov
ernor Allen came to Washington In the
hope that the President would relieve him
of his duties in Porto Rico and that he
a*ked the President to do so, but the
President prevailed upon him to continue
at the head of the administration of af
fairs of the island. Governor Allen en-
Joys the confidence of the President to
a very great degree and he felt that it
was his duty to accede to the wishes of
the chief executive.
After the conference, however. Gov
ernor Allen announced that he would not
resign and would return to his duties
about the first week In May, after set
tling up some private affairs in Boston.
WASHINGTON, April 6.â Charles H.
Allen, Governor of Porto Rico, who ar
rived in Washington this morning, had
an hour's conference with President Mc-
Kinley to-day. Great interest was mani
fested in Governor Allen's visit, on ' ac
count of rumors that have been rife ever
since he sailed from San Juan that it was
his Intention to relinquish his post in the

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
To Keep Well.
It is easy to keep well; if we would only
observe each day a few simple rules of
health. Â¦
The all Important thing is to keep the
stomach rlgrht, Â¦ and to do this It is not
necessary -to diet or to follow a set rule
or â¢ bill of fare. Such pampering-, simply
makes a capricious appetite and. a feeling
that certain favorite articles of food must
be avoided. â¢
Professor Wlechold gives pretty good
advice on this subject. He says.â ,"1 am
68 years old and have never had a serious
illness,. and at the same time my life has
been largely an indoor one, but I early
discovered : that the way to keep healtiiy
was to keep a healthy stomach, not by
eating bran crackers or dieting of any
sort; on the contrary I always eat what
my appetite craves, but for the past eight
years I have made it a daily practice to
take .one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after- each meal, and I attribute
my robust health for a man of my age
to the regular dally use of, Stuart's Tab-
lets. â¢â¢ Â¦ ' "i
-"Â¦"My physician -first advised me to use
them because he said they were perfectly
harmless and were not , a : secret patent
medicine, 'but contained only. the natural
digestives, . peptones 'and, diastase, and
after using them a few ,' weeks I - Â¦ have
never ceased to "thank him for his advice.
"I honestly believe the habit of taking.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets , after meals is
the real health habit, because their use
brings health to the sick and ailing and
preserves health to the well and strong."
Men and -women past flfty years, of. age
need a safe digestive after meals to insure
a perfect digestion. and to ward off dis-
ease, and the safest, best known and roost
widely " used is Stuart's " Dyspepsia Tab-
lets. ' - Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦ ---- â¢ : ;.
â¢ They are' found ' in every well regulated
household from Maine to California, and
In Great Britain and Australia are rapidly,
pushing. their way into popular favor. ~
â¢ All drug-grists sell Stuart's "Dyspepsia
.Tablets.: full . sized â¢ packages i at 60 events,
and for a weak stomach a 50-cent package
will of ten do flfty ' dollars worth of good.

Â¦~ He : remained in that position until a
change in the laws abolished the position
of marker and he was promoted a musi
cian. He then served In the ranks as pri
vate until an opportunity presented itself,
when he asked to be transferred to the
signal corps of the Second Brigade. He
remained with that branch of the service
until the war of 1898, when he was one of
the five accepted from the signal corps of
San Francisco ; to' serve in the United
States Volunteer Signal Corps, in which
* he was appointed corporal. While in that
service at Bacoor,- P." I., he was selected
as the bearer of dispatches sent from
United States army headquarters to Agui

won the esteem of the officers and his
comrades, who. all admired him for his
highmindedness. Upon his discharge from
. the service at Manila on account of phys

tain on his papers that which any soldier
. may. point to with pride â "Service honest
and faithful, a man of excellent charac
ter." Upon his return to this country he
served one year longer with the signal
. corps in order to enable him to secure a
ten-year service medal. ;

. f In December. 1S99, I was taken
'bfÂ£ 2 *ick with Black Typhoid Fever.
TLi 9 ' the most virulent type known
W-Â» L to medical science. I had hem-
JC^P'^v crrhagep. both nasal and intes-

Â«*/Â»Â«iÂ»Jfi* "Woo. the eminent Chinese phy-
eician. was called, and with one dose of hiÂ«
lea stopped the flow cf blood, thereby saving
my life, as I had been given up by any white
phyeician. as wÂ»ll as by all my friends. Was
unconscious four weeks, but by Dr. Wojiis Woo's
wonderful skill he saved my life from this most
fatal of all fevers. Although I was confined to
my bed three months, was able to resume my
vocation in eix months from the time I went to
bed. and now I weigh 202 pounds, more than I
had ever attained previously. I would cheer-
lully recommend IV. Won* Woo to any one in
need of a firM-rlstss physician for any cause
whatsoever.â ItALPH N. FOLKS. 315 Golden

Musical Feature of the McKinley
Parade in San Jose.
BAN JOSE, April 6.â The young ladies
cf San Jose who compose the ladies' band
have consented to play in the parade of
the Carnival of Roses. This will have
been the second occasion since the forma
tion of this unique musical organization
that it played outside of a concert hall or
the parlors of the leading hotels. Last
Fourth of July, at the Elks' celebration at
San Jose, the band rode in a fairy float.
In the parade to be given to honor Presi
dent McKiniey and his party it will ride
in a Cower-trimmed vehicle and will bd
given the first place among the musical
lealures of the procession. .,
After considerable parley the railroad
liiit luauc a. cuuct!i!>iuii m "rated t ruin ail
parts of California which is satisfactory
to the carnival management. From points
under 125 miles a one and a third fare for
the round trip will be charged; up to 200
miles one ana a fifth, the customary sin
gle-trip rate, and over 200 miles one fare
tor the round trip. This lowered rate will
bring thousands of people from not only
the near-by towns but also from the
southern portions of the State, where the
opening of the coast route has caused a
strong interest in San Jose.
The appointment by Mayor Martin of
the reception committee has been the
cause of some sad hearts in San . Jose.
There has been much rivalry to obtain
places on this committee, as it will have
to do with the personal supervision of
the President's comfort and will bring Its

OP ABANDONED MINE
Prospectors Find Edward Galloday's
Burros Wandering Alone on
the Desert.
SAN BERNARDINO. April 6.â The ef
forts of Edward Galloday, an old mining
prospector, to find an abandoned gold
mine which he supposed contained much
hidden wealth, has in all probability cost
him hla life. It is believed he has either
perished or met foul play on the desert
somewhere between Indlo and Yuma.
One month ago Galloday left Yuma for
the mountains, with provisions and five
burros. During the past few days other
prospectors have come across his entire
pack train and supplies, but no trace of
Galloday was found.
Galloday has for years been In search of
the lost mine, and crossed the desert
many times. He was familiar with the
watering places and knew the country
well, hence the belief that he has met a
tragic death. Galloday went to Nevada
in 1&C8 and located several valuable claims,
which he afterward lost. At one time he
was employed as assistant superintendent
on the Comstock. Of late he has led the
life of a hermit.
Dr. Ehuxtleff Sinking.
STOCKTON. April 6.â Dr. George A.
Shurtlefl. the well-known pioneer. Is very
low to-night and a fatal termination of
his illness Is regarded as but a matter of
a day ax the most. An attack of bron
chitis brought on the Illness and his age
is so advanced that he Is ill-prepared to
Â¦withstand It
ASYLUM OFFICES
IN THE BALANCE
San Joaquin Republicans
Recommend Two Men
for Directors.
Aspirant Who la "Turned
Down" Claims That Governor .
Gage Has Already Ap
pointed Him. ;
SpeclU DUpatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. April 6.â The Republican
County Committee to-day passed up to
Governor Gage a recommendation that
Charles 1L Kennlston and W. C. White
bÂ« appointed directors of the State Insane
Asylum In this city. There were four
men In nomination and two to be selected.
Kennlston and White received 36 and 38
votes, respectively, as against 1 for F. E.
Lan* and 7 for J. D. Gray.
/ The recomendations, though decisive as
to the desiree of the party, were not ob
tained without a bitter fight being waged
ae&lnst them by the friends of F. E. Lane,
onÂ« of whom tried to avert action In the
committee by declaring that Governor
Gact had already appointed Mr. Lane and
tna.t It would not be courteous for tne
committee to offer suggestions. This
vu the position taken by the faction
which has been fighting Dr. George S.
Harkness and the Republican County
Committee, of which Dr. Harkness was
elected chairman by an overwhelming ma
jority In the last county convention of the
party. The majority of the committee
refused to believe that the Governor had
taken action, since he had in the past
acted upon the recommendations of the
committee and had, so it is understood,
suggested that the committee be called to
gether to act in this instance.
The fact thar Mr. Lane received only
one vote in the committee naturally raises
the Question as to where Governor Gage
and the San Joaquin Republican organiza
tion can ever get together in the future,
should It prove that he has appointed Mr.
Lane. It is understood that Mr. Lane
claims to expect his commission in a few
days. ',
A resolution waa passed by the commit
tee approving the Governor's action in ap
pointing George W. Lagridge to the di
rectorate.

SHAW'S CAPTAIN BRASSBOUND'S
Conversion the Last
OF THE PLAYS FOR PURITANS.
The first reports that have .come from ! the . Duke of York since he started , upon his tour of
the British \ colonies . announce , that; his ship was caught in a storm -and the Duke Â¦ has . been seasick ;
but \ve believe the illness was not severe enough to make him throw up the trip.
Reports . from ; London announce that two members of .Parliament have been unseated. . one
for bribery and the other for "circulating false reports concerning i-his opponent during the cam
paign."^ Suppose a similar 'rule prevailed in Congress, -How many 'members of the. House of'Repre
sentatives would hold their seats. after the shake-up was over?
TIME was that Florida controlled the American orange product, arid looked upon California
as a feeble upstart in. citrus productions. Then she elevated us to the pedestal of a rival in
that line, and complained that our freight rates were too favorable, and, distance considered,
made our competition unfair. Then, frost fell upon her orchards, first taking the bloom, next the
fruit and then freezing the trees to lhe roots. She replanted,, but before the new groves bloomed
they were killed in their turn, and now the effort has ceased. The field isleft to California, and
Florida plants no more. Her citrus growers are migrating to Northern California, where they can
look on the Sierra snows, and fan themselves while picking oranges in December. The sole Flor
ida industry now is serving the winter tourists. The State is turned into a hotel, and there- the
Northern consumptive basks on the balconies, while the more able-bodied troll for tarpon and
shoot alligators.; The land of Billy' Bowlegs is asanitarium and pleasure-ground.
Now Florida looks with jaundiced eye upon California again as a rival in this new business.
The birds of passage who blow out 'of the boreal region. and retreat before the snow have discov
ered that California has ad vantages, over Florida for these purposes, and "many a tired wing rests
for the winter at San Diego, Los Angeles arid clear to the Upper Sacramento Valley. The tour
ists find here sunshine and clemency of climate joined to an energizing zest; .while in Flor
ida they find only languor and enervation. So the, neurotics, the victims of insomnia, the sufferers
from the remorse of, a guilty -stomach, as well as the* hardy but tired and the wholesome seekers
for a wholesome change, find what they want in California. They find it, too, in the midst of Lhe
finest natural scenery in the world and in the midst of the finest and most constant production
of everything that quenches the thirst and satisfies the; appetite of man. The canned goods
menu of Florida is unknown here. Our gardens are perennial as our flowers, and every ? food
from beans to, woodcock and every, beverage from the finest. water to the finest wine, grows on the
premises, and "the maidens are soft r as the roses they twine."- / .... Uf;;]
Florida will always have plenty* of tourists whose strength' or- purse is too short to go
farther and fare better, but California .'will always have. those who would rather live or die in
greater comfort. ~ \ â¢: â¢ Â¦ .. -

FLORIDA RIVALRY.
WHEN Senator Morgan .went out to- Hawaii to' persuade the people to content them
selves with annexation, a deputation" of intelligent natives waited upon him and asked
what their position would be after annexation. He replied that they would have the
same rights as the negroes have in the United States.; .V v
They then asked what were the rights of the negroes here, and the Senator v made no
reply. . ./ - : .Â»Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢ ' . . .' ' 'â¢â¢>â¢/
Since then his idea of the rights of the negro has been developed, and it is the idea of all
the former slave States. Even the border States, wherein, slavery was beginning to die before
the Civil War, have the same idea and are acting upon it, as in Maryland. . â¢ â¢
But the Alabama Senator has not left the query of the Hawaiians to-be any longer â¢unan
swered by silence, nor by events. , He has declared himself, and though the declaration was ob
viously not intended for publication, it is published.
In a letter written to Editor Greer of the Standard, Marion, Ala., Senator Morgan says:
"The apportionment bill and the counting of the â¢ electoral vote without the question being
raised as to the constitutionality of the Presidential election in Louisiana and Mississippi is a dis
tinct victory for white suffrage. \ " .
â¢ "Maryland has seen her opportunity and has hastened to profit by ' it. When things are
coming our way there is no necessity for clamorous discussion until they are settled, lest some
one might interrupt. So I think the least 'said is the best just now on the negro question. Those^
people will begin to draw off to the Philippines at an early day.. 'They are already going to
Hawaii, and we shall soon find room for white people in the South. Then we shall.be a free and
happy people.
"When the time arrives I, will elaborate these views, but at present it is better not to dis
cuss them/ We should take n lesson from the Cubans and discuss the negro question with closed
doors in our convention. . '
"The silent progress we are making is very encouraging." That may be read several
times and pondered, much. The "silent progress" made is an open nullification of the constitution
of the United States and the wresting from the negroes of any voice or influence in their own
government. They are thereby returned to the same political condition they were in when they
were slaves. But the Senator sees further happy results from this suppression .of their" consti
tutional rights. He looks -to it as a means of forcing them out of the country entirely. He
thinks that as some are going to Hawaii, the rest will follow, and that they will people the'Philip
pines, making room for white men, when "We will be a free and happy people." , .
As no one is inclined to battle for the rights of a people who will not themselves defend
those rights, it is highly improbable that any considerable number of the Northern people will be
found ready to stand by the constitution and insist that all of its guarantees shall be enjoyed by
those to whom they weregiven.- Morgan's citation of the form that nullification took in Mississippi
is especially suggestive. There is some craftiness in the Maryland and South Carolina laws, and
searching argument and analysis are required to prove them obnoxious to the constitution. But
it is not so with the law of Mississippi. It is clearly disfranchisement ofliving negroes because
their dead grandfathers were slaves. No wonder the Senator regards Northern indifference to that
flagrant provision as "a distinct victory" over the constitution, though he hides it under the
euphemism of "white suffrage." ;
We think that we are justified in concluding that negro suffrage is doomed, and that the
constitution of the United States is powerless to secure it against the determined opposition of
any considerable number of people. The whole country on a rising vote stands for white suffrage
only, and on a (fall for the negative no one rises; for the; time to do so was when* the Congressional
apportionment passed the'. last Congress. The South 1 wili be permitted to; disfranchise the negro
and yet retain over fifty Congressmen and as many votes in the electoral college, by still counting
him for purposes of apportionment and representation. Arid this, although, both are directly and
distinctly forbidden by the Federal constitution! . - . ;
This condition opens up a wide field not for speculation' but for reflection as to the future
status of Porto Rico, Hawaii and- the Philippines. We are, by the active agency of the South
and the passive consent of thcNorth, establishing the principle that this, is a white man's govern
ment. We are going back to the Dred Scott decision and accepting' that part of its dicta as a re
peal of the fifteenth amendment/ 'Â¦Â¦'â¢ Â¦-'Â¦Â¦ ' ; : , , ... ' ( ;
All this is in line 'with what we believe is the present mind and will be the future inflexible
policy of the people as to all the islands. - Their black and yellow millions will never be admitted
to equal citizenship, nor their territory to. statehood in this Jepublic.
All told, they number about 16,060,006, and the decree may be regarded as written that
they are to be permanently excluded. Much future trouble is "avoided by present frankness.. The
reported inducement held out for pacification of the Filipinos, that they are to have statehood and
citizenship, is a lure > and delusion. They., will .never have either. If they choose to take the oath
with that understanding there is" no objection, but to take it with the promise of statehood is
a process of sowing dragon's teeth. ,
With the principle of exclusive \ white government established, we will find ourselves with
13,000,000 of domestic negroes and 16,060,000 of islanders oh bur hands to be governed, Â¦without
substantial voice in that government. That will be 30,000,000 of people, denied independence,
held in political chattelry and'deprived of the only means by which they can consent to ; government.
Passive submission, or open revolt is. all that is left to them. V.
Before we bind the islands irrevocably it is well to give some thought to these con
siderations, . ." ; Â¦ , *
TO-DAY I propose to consider briefly !
"Captain Brassbound's Conver
" sion." the last play in George Ber
nard Shaw's "Three Plays for Purl
tans." Though inferior in wit to
"Caesar and Cleopatra" and In . char
acterization to "The Devil's Disciple,"
this play has an Interest of Its own In
being' what might be termed more prac
ticable. "The Devil's Disciple" requires
for thÂ« character of Richard Dudgeon an
actor as good in his peculiar line as
la Mr. Mansfield or Mr. Millerâ and the
eupply of Mansflelds and Millers is strictly
limited. "Caesar and Cleopatra" requires
for the character of Cleopatra a lady as
beautiful as Miss Blanche Walshâ only
with a stormier and more gypsy-like
beautyâ and ten years younger. Where
Is that lady to be found? Where Is the
â¢girl of 16 who could play this tigress In
petticoats T Yet without such an actress
"Caesar and Cleopatra" would be even
mora unsatisfactory than was "The Little
Minister" with Miss Adams left outâ or,
one might truthfully add, more unsatis
factory than was "Romeo and Julliet"
with .Miss Adams put in. Â¦Â¦'V'.-.
But "Captain Brassbound's Conversion"
requires for Its Interpretation neither a
MaEBfleld nor a budding Bernhardt; Its
principal character. Lady Cicely Wayn
fleete. Is well within the range of such an
Actress as Miss KIdder or Miss Annie
Russell or three or four others that
might be mentioned. Moreover, while its
Betting Is ingeniously picturesque, it is
not bodied forth on a scale of Oriental
magnificence as Is the setting of "Caesar
end Cleopatra" and would cost only a
ttthe of the $25,000 which that dream of
th* gorgeous East would cost to produce,
la It absurd to hope, then, that some man
ager may be found who, being able to
distinguish a heron from a handsaw, may
also be able to recognize in this fine play
a. work that Is not too bright and good
for feuman nature's dally food? â¢ â¢ â¢
Or, must we continue to be fed upon the
chopped straw of cheap melodrama and
vulgar farce, untilâ but Mr. Shaw has
himself described the results of (his) three
years'-Btarving upon. such diet. After
having survived the terrors of concerts
and picture galleries, the theater, he says,
struck him down like the veriest weak
ling: "1 sank under It like a baby fed on
starch. My very bones began to perish,
so that I had to get them planed and
gouged by accomplished surgeons. I fell
from heights and broke my limb's In
pieces. The doctors said, 'This man has
not eaten meat for twenty years; he must
eat it or die.' I said, 'This man has been
going to the London theaters for three
years and the soul of him. has become
Inane and is feeding unnaturally on his
body.* And I was right. I did not
change my diet; but I had myself carried
Â¦up Into a. mountain Â¦where there was ! no
theater, and there I began to revive. Too
weak to work, I wrote books and plays;
hence the second and third plays in this
volume. And now I am stronger than 1
have been at any moment since my feet
first carried me as a critic across the
fatal threshold of a London playhouse.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Why was this? What Is the mat
ter with the theater that a strong man
can die of It?" What, indeed! ! â¢
To return to Captain Brassbound. The
play opens on the coast of Morocco in a
garden belonging to one Rankln, a good
Scotch missionary. In a conversation be
tween him and Sailor Drinkwater. a pro
duct of the London slums, and Mr. Ran
kln'e only convert after twenty-five years
of unselfish to'il among the Mohammedans,
we learn that Sir Howard Hallam, the
celebrated English Judge, and his sister
in-law. Lady Cicely Waynfleete. have just
arrived at Mosador and desire to make
a trip into the interior. Drinkwater begs
that Mr. Rankin will recommend tp them
as escort, to protect them from the Arabs,
his chief. Captain Brassbound, better
known as Black Paquito.
Drinkwater (with overwhelming convic
tion)âAw"ll teoll you, guvner, wot he is.
*K's a pafflck genlmn, thet's wot 'e is.
Rankln (gravely)â Mr, . . Drlnkwotter,
pairfection Is an attribute, not of West
Coast captains but of the Maker. And
there are gentlemen and gentlemen in the
Â¦world, especially In these latitudes. Which
eort of gentleman is he?
Drinkwaterâ Hinglish genlmn, guvner.
Hinglish speakin'; Hinglish fawther; West
Hinjln plawnter; Hinglish true blue breed.
(Reflectively) â Tech o* brahn from j the
mather, preps, ehe bein' Brazilian.
Smuggler though he Is, Brassbound has
nerved with Gordon. . and . has promised
him never to smuggle slaves or gin, so
since Sir Howard and Lady Cicely are
bound to make the expedition he is en
gaged to escort them. Lady Cicely is a
type â¢ of that sweet reasonableness that
would have delighted Matthew Arnold. :
She has traveled unharmed across Africa
protected by this theory: "Why do peo
ple set killed by savages? Because, in
etead of being polite to them and saying
how-de-do, like me, people aim pistols at
them. I've been among savages, canni
bals and all sorts. Everybody said they'd
ki!l me. But when I met them I said how
de-do, and they were quite nice. The
kings always wanted to marry me."
At the first interview between Brass :
bound. Rankln and the traveler. Rankln
seems to recognize something about
Brassbound, but. cannot tell Just what It
Is. Brassbound evidently recognizes Sir
Howard, for he Is much agitated, warns
him of the dangers ahead of htm and ad
vises him not to gro.
Brassboundâ You are safft here. I warn
you, In those hills there Is a Justice that
is not the Justice of your courts in Eng
land. If you have wronged a man, you
may meet that man there. If you have
wronged a woman, " you may meet her
sen there. The justice of those hills is the
justice of vengeance. Â¦ - :
Sir Howard (faintly amused)â You are
superstitious, captain. Most sailors are,
I notice. However, I havecbmplete con
fidence in your escort. . ,. : ,
Brassbound (almost threateningly)â
Take care. 'The avenger may be one of
the escort. -
Sir Howardâ I have already met the
only member of your escort who might
have borne a grudge against me, captain,
and he was acquitted.'
Brassboundâ You are fated to come,
then?
Sir Howard (smiling)â It seems so.
Brassbound â On your head be It! (To
Lady Cicely, accepting her hand at last)â
Good-night.
He goes. It is by this time starry night.
The ' second act opens In Brassbound's
stronghold, an old Moorish castle In the
foothills of the Atlas Mountains. Thither
Brassbound has conducted Sir Howard
and Lady Cicely. One of the escort, Mar
zo, a poor Italian, has been wounded.
Lady Cicely takes Brassbound's own room
for him and in general assumes charge
of. the garrison in a way that astonishes
that stalwart buccaneer. Brassbound's
men are powerlestttfcefore her womanly
charm. When she orders Drlnkwater to
nurse the sick man, he meekly submits,
andâ more astonishing stillâ the rest of
the brigands hustle him off for a bath
at her antiseptic- command. But to Sir
Howard Brassbound is insolent. When
an explanation la demanded, he breaks
out: "You are not my guest; you are my
prisoner." ;
Sir Howardâ Prisoner!
(Lady Cicely, after a single glance up,
continues stitching, apparently quite un
concerned.)
Brassboundâ I warned you. You should
have taken my warning.
Sir Howard ; (Immediately taking the
tone of cold disgust for moral delin*
quency)â Am I to understand then that
you are a brigand? Is this a matter of
ransom?
Brassbound (with unaccountable inten
sity)_All the wealth of England shall not
ransom you.
Sir Howardâ Then what do you Intend
to gain by this? ' . - . _ â¢
Brassbound-JUSTICE ON A ROBBER
AND A MURDERER!
Then the story comes out. Brassbound
is Sir Howard's nephewâ the son of the
West Indian planter of act 1 and of a
Brazilian woman (who drank herself to
death). He had been robbed of his es
tate, as he believed, by Sir Howard, and
bis mother, attempting to get her rights,
had been imprisoned as a dangerous va
grant by this same Sir Howard, sitting aa
a criminal magistrate. Revenge is Brass
bound's Idea: he has his "uncle in his
power; he will sell him to the Moors as
a slave! How he was induced by Lady
Cicely to forego that revenge, how, with
out a suspicion of coquetry, she convert
ed him from his purpose â all this is told
in a long scene of extraordinary power,
humor and pathos. Suffice it, . his . better
nature revives at the touch of a good
woman's hand; when the Moorish chief
Sidl, to whom he has promised to sell Sir
Howard, comes for his white slave Brass
bound offers himself to pay the price
agreed upon. SIdi consents on condition
that he Is to have Lady Cicely! Brass
bound refuses; the fight that la imminent
is prevented only by the opportune arri
val, with a large force, of the Cadi of the
province, who has learned of Brass
bound's scheme, arrests him and al! his
men as abductors and prepares to hurry
them back to Mogador.
Sir Upward (dryly)â I told you you were
not In a strong position. Captain Brass
bound. (Looking implacably at him.) You
are laid by the heels, my friend, as I said
you would be.
Lady Cicelyâ But I assure youâ 1 '
Brassbound (interrupting her) â What
have you tt> assure him of? You p'er-
Buaded me to spare him. , Look at his
face, wm you be able to persuade him
to spare me?
Was Lady Cicely able to persuade him7
Or was Brassbound hanged? If he was
not hanged, did he live to marry Lady
Cicely? Does the very suggestion of this
shock you? If yes, why? And -how did
Mr. Shaw get into his play that charming
American naval captain, commander' of
the cruiser Santiago, of whom we have
yet heard nothing? And where dldLady
Cicely pick up her. peculiar Ideas about
the proper arrangements for stokers on
board an American man-of-war? And
how did she get Captain Kearney to ac
cept them? And what are Mr. Shaw's
views on phonetics and Waterloo road
ethics as set forth In the character of
that "Pafflck Genlmn," Mr. Dunkwater?â
Go to; who am I that I should answer for
you all these delightfully puzzling ques
tions, when my friend, Herbert Stone, will
answer them for you if you will but buy
a! copy -of Mr.. Shaw's "Three Plays for
Puritans," as I consider It your bounden
duty to do? 'Which duty, If you do but
fulfill, you will thank me all the days of
your life.
THE New York musical press Is just
now full of the new Reyer opera.
"Salammbo." founded on the bril
liant novel of Flaubert, which
was given for the first time In
America a couple of weeks aco at the
Metropolitan Opera-house with the fol
lowing cast:
Salammbo, Miss Lucienne Breval: Taanach.
Miss Carrie Bridewell; Matho. Mr. Ealeia:
Shahabarim. Mr. Sallsmac; Narr Havas. Mr.
Journet; Spendius. Mr. Sizes: Glscon, Mr. Gil
bert: Autharite. Mr. Dufriche: Hamilcar. Mr.
Scotti; Mancinelli conducting.
The libretto is by Camllle du Loche.
who, according) to James Huneker, has
"butchered Flaubert'3 book to make a
Parisian holiday," though accomplish
ing his task successfully according to his
lightsâ theatrical lights." Of Reyer's part
in the matter Mr. Huneker savs:
I could only distinguish two well-deflned lead
ing motives In the partition. One came from
Gounod's "Romeo and Juliet." fourth act, the
other is a slight deviation from Tristan's cry
in act three: "O Isolde." For the rest I have
a vague remembrance of cantilena without
melody, finales without climax, a thin, noisy,
shallow and irritating stream of orchestration
and a vocal score that either screamed or
roared. The harmonic scheme is dull and .there
is little rhythmic variety. Reyer, as I eald
before, has few musical Ideas, and he does
not conceal this deficiency by the graceful ex
ternals of a brilliant instrumentation. I saw
"Salammbo" twice in Paris and twice here.
I never wish to see or hear it again. As well
meant as 'was Reyer*s admiration for the Im
mortal story, a story that will outlive the
mock antiquities , of Bulwer, Ebers and Sln
kiewlcz, the French critic and composer was
not the man to give It a musical setting. Wag
ner or Verdiâ none otherâ could have made of
this glowing Oriental prose-poem a music
drama of vital power and exquisite coloring.
Of exceptional Interest to us Is the of
ficial statement of the New York Metro
politan Opera-house management, issued
last week at the close of the winter sea
son, to the effect that the Metropolitan
forces will -really be with us again next
season. It has seemed almost over-good
to be true, but there now seems to be no
doubt of the matter.,- As to who will be
heard here next season in addition to the
Grau . galaxy of last vear the oracle is
silent, but here is a list. of artists culled
from the. Musical Courier who have
signed contracts with Covent Garden for
the London season: -
Soprano â Calve, Eames, Ternlna, Su
zanne Adams, Breval, Gadski, Strakosch,
Sobrino, Bauermeister; .contraltos and
mczzcs â Brema, the Misses Olitzka, Del
mar. . Aldridge. Maubourg; tenors â Tam
agno, Knole, Walther. There will be two
new singers, a young Italian named An
selmi, who has had a good reputation In
Naples, and a French-Canadian of the
name of Mercier. Other strangers to
Covent'Garden will be Reisse, whose voice
is said to be one o$ the finest in Ger
many, and Forgeur, who comes from.
Brussels. Others who â¢will appear are
"Van Dyck, Saleza, Van, Rooy, Plancon,
Scotti, Bispham, Blass, De Clery and Gili
bert. The" conductors will be Mancinelli
and Klbn Lohse. New works to be given
are Lalo's "Rol d'Ts" and Dr. Stanford's
new opera, "Much Ado About Nothing."
The libretto of the latter opera, by the
way, was written by a Philadelphian,
Julian Sturges, and the Benedick will be
sung by another Philadelphian, much ad
mired here. David Bispham.'
It will be noted that the names of the
De Â¦ Reszke' brothers are absent from the
Covent Garden's list up to date, they
having refused the terms offered by the
new management.- Of course, if ; the re
port of the illness of the incomparable
Jean be only half true, neither Covent
Garden nor anywhere else could know
him for many months, if ever. Melba,
Nordica, Schumann-Heink and Cam
panani are also among tne missing, and
altogether, our star list of last year com
pares most favorably with that of the
great home of opera in England.
As to our own coming season. Calve
is already promised by Mr. Grau, Calve
who sings Juliet, Carmen, everything,
and who is the greatest Carmen of his
tory. It Is to be Â¦ hoped that we shall
also have Eames and Ternlna among the
sopranos, the latter of whom seems to
be possessed of ; the same universal
genius as Jean 1 de Reszke; great as a
Wagnerian singer and equally wonderful
in ltal.an opera. Her Isolde is said to be
beyond all, comparison. With these and
Jean de Reszke in addition to his brother,
it is quite probable that Mr. Grau would
again be "delighted" with his season In
San Francisco.
The American Guild of Organists will
hold a local examination for the diploma
of assoclateship in the guild on Wednes
day, April 24, } simultaneously with the
most important Eastern cltiea. Name3 of
candidates should be handed in to Wal
lace A. Sabln, the local examiner, on or
before April 15.
The many friends of Mme. Julie Rose
wald, the well known vocal teacher, will
be glad to learn of her complete restora
tion to health and of her intent to return
to California during the" summer. She
will resume her work among us, and says,
after four years* travel about the world,
that she will be well content to settle
down in San Francisco.
"How to Be an Organist Though In,
India" Is the quaint subject of a plaintive
little paper In the current number of Mu
sic. For the Occidental organist, impa
tient of the familiar freakishness of his
instrument,- this humorous plaint from
the tropics* is indispensable reading. If
he would be content to suffer in such
silence as the accident permits the
"ciphering" of a note during service, the
haughty pitch, of .the reeds when the day
It is hot, the classic sleeplessness of the
man behind the.- bellows, let him spend
five minutes with this organ-grinder in
India.
His instrument Is a small one, fourteen
stops, a rarity .in the neighborhood (no
wonder!), and tuned -once a year by a
long-distance tuner from' Calcutta. In
the tropic summer, during the season of
hot winds, its favorite amusement is to
unglue itself in every, possible place
wht-re a respectable organ goes glued.
Then the Ivory caps of the keys have a
happy fashion of projecting themselves
into space (with a preference for the or
ganist's nose) at every opportunity, and
a delightful habit of wearing themselves
curled when the weather permils. The
bellows, too, join, in the general rebellion,
and with the able-bodied assistance of the
somnolent native blower are responsible
for tho many weirdly humorous effects
peculiar to the Indian church service.
Altogether,- the life of the : organist in
India Is not a happy 'one, and the perusal
of his little tale of woe is distinctly con
ducive to a decent" content with our own
musical-climatic conditions. He has,
what I understand is termed In Kansas',
"a hot time.". .v
That was a sheer triumph, of .tempera
ment the other evening at the Twentieth
Century Club concert, when Mr. Paul
Egry, with the , Max Bruch concerto as
medium, drew a quadrangle , encore from
a popular audience for his rendering of
this /purely classical number. The vio
linist's . reception was the ' more marked,
in that he 'came" toward the latter end of
a longish programme that began almost
half:; an"' hour." late. /.This," by . the way,
was the case with^ the two former con
certs, and it Is respectfully. "suggested to
the club that It is a bad ; precedent to
establish In' a" concert : series, more *es-
pecially of the. popular kind. Let there
be added the grace of punctuality to the
many good features of these entertain
ments, with closed doors during tha
numbers, and two points toward the ethi
cal education of the audience shall have
been gained. To return to Mr. Egry.
The violinist is a brother of the well
known 'cellist, Mr. Arthur Weiss, and
was himself well known here a few years
ago as the leader of a small band in one
of the popular resorts, but he has dono
comparatively little solo work. One was
of course prepared for something rather
out of the ordinary by the player's choice
of number, and his Interpretation amply
justified the prophecy. Mr. Egry has
any amount of temperament, a big tone,
a facile wrist and a quick and sura
though not always clean technique. Ho
gave an Impassioned and spirited render-
Ing of the concerto, which, as before said,
greatly pleased his audience.
Another number of interest was the
"Elegie" and "Scherzo," from the new
Arenaky trio for piano, -violin and 'cello,
riven by Messrs. Genss. Egry and Weis^.
The "Elegie" is a graceful Dut thin move
ment witnout any attempt at elegiac pro
fundity, and the rendering of the
"Scherzo" left the Impression of lnsum
cient rehearsal. As it was heard it
seemed a rather labored effort in the di
rection of rhythmic originality, not war
ranted by any particular beauty of result.
Mr. Weiss furnished the popular classic
element with Thome's "Simple Aveu" and
the Popper "Gavotte," in the tricky ac
companiment to which Mr. Genss lost
himself slightly with the rest of us. It
is true that Mr. Weiss takes a consider
able liberty with the tempi. Mr. Gensa
solos were a musical "Night Song, of nn
own and the Schubert-Tauslg ' Mllitar
marsch." Two Bargiel "Spring Songs. 1
rendered In amateurish fashion by Mrs.
Mulcahy, Miss Lyon, SIlss Bruntsch.and
Miss Forder, and two barytone solos, sym
pathetically sung by John . Plagemann,
completed the programme.
As befits the gracious season the char
ity affair Is rather in tne ascendant Just
now.- To-morrow\ evening a talk on bl
berla from a new standpoint will be STlvea
by William Mitchell at Sherman-Clay
Hall for the benefit of the Children's Hos
pital. There will bÂ« some songs by Mian
Marie Partridge. â¢ â¢ â¢ On Tuesday
evening the bis charitv concert at tno
MarH Hopkins institute of Art. will taka
place with the societv amateur as per
former and the San Francisco Art Asso
ciation, St Ignatius Training School for
Servants. Seamen's Institute and Anni
tage Orphanage as beneficiaries. An ad
mirable programme 13 assured by tno
presence of the following names: Sirs.
Gustavus Arnold, Mrs. Jack Casserly,
Miss Bessie Ames, Miss Hulda Anderson,
the Misses Sherman. Miss Agnes Bergin.
Mr and Mrs. B. G. t.athroi>, William
Byrne and Edgar Mills. A chorus of
men's voices from the- Bohemian Club wU
add to the Joys of living and a dainty
supper will serve to annex the re*
malning nickels for the cause. Over
$1300 worth of tickets have already
been sold. â¢ â¢ â¢ On the same evening
the Tivoli gives a benefit performance oÂ£
"The Idol's Eye." with specialties from
â¢ the Orpheum. for the free ward and clinia
of the California Eye and Ear Hospital.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Yet another Tuesday affair, a very
unfortunate coincidence "of dates, la an
other of the charming song lectures by
Father McLoughlin, to be given at the
Metropolitan Temple. The lecture (I be
lieve), Is to be titled "The Rose* Sham
rock and Thistle." and any one interested
In English, Irish and Scotch song litera
ture and susceptible to the charm of a
limpid and polished English will do well
to hear the priest-singer, who certainly
has a "wonderful way" with him. â¢ â¢ â¢
I see that the ladles of the California Club
have been fortunate enough to secura
Mrs. Arnold for the opening 1 , ceremonies
of the Industrial and Allied Arts Exhibi
tion at Mechanics' Pavilion on Wednesday
evening next, and that the talented singer
will also be heard at St. Luke's Church
to-day. < ='-'

There was a very pleasant surprise
party on the transport wharf yesterday.
In response to an urgent telephone mes
sage Captain N. P. Batchelder, assistant
quartermaster, hurried down to the wharf
to be welcomed by all hands and the cook.
Be fere he could ask a question Captain
John Barneson, superintendent of the
transport service, stepped forward and on
behalf of the dock officials presented him
with a magnificent gold-mounted sword.
Captain Bachelder has just passed a most
successful examination and been pro
moted from the volunteer service to the
regular army, and the officials and em
ployes of the service took the occasion to
show their appreciation of him as an offi
cer and a gentleman. The sword bears

Â¦ Oil men will wait the outcome of the
forthcoming meeting Â« to be held in the
Palace Hotel in this city before they can
determine what the general situation Is.
With a proper issue the meeting, - which
is called by President Ach of the Monte
Cristo Company, should prove of great ad
vantage to the oil , producers, who,
seemingly, need' to be united. In fact,
union is indispensable; to concerted action
when there are so many companies to do
business in the State. ' The good to' come
to the Kern and McKittrick districts oil
men will also eventually be of advantage
to the remainder of the State. At the
present time there are all sorts 'of propo-,
sition3 to >be heard,' more or less calcu
lated to remedy existing troubles in mar
keting fuel oil. One prominent oil man
suggested yesterday â¢ that to shut down
all wells for a period, excepting such as
are filling contracts already made, would
be a measure that would be sure to raise
the price. ~ -
The Standard Oil people naturally wish
to buy, oil as cheaply as possible, that
the margin of profit may be larger when
selling it to large consumers. With di
vided forces the oil men will not be able
to have their way, which is in the direc
tion of better prices. It Is held by pro
ducers that the competition of oil against
oil is absurd when the real competition
ought to be only against coal, which the
cheaper fuel is in the field to supersede.
The situation is the most interesting that
has yet been presented in connection with
the oil industry of California. '
The Bieber Gazette says that claims for
oil have been located in the Stone Coal
Valley. Oil seepag-e in the foothills, both
east and west of Bieber, have been dis
covered. The country has been given the
name of the "Pit River oil fields" because
of proximity to the riveY. . â¢
One of the wells in Shasta County 13
down 700 feet. Gas is reported to be is
suing from another.
More than $1000 in fees, so says the San
Bernardino Sun, has been paid into the
County 'Recorder's office this month, for
the location of claims, of which the ma
jority, are oil claims. The oil locations
are nearly all near Victor, at which place
the oil excitement' continues. The Sun
remarks that it is true all . the desert
around Victor has been located.
The Antioch. Ledger reports that a
heavy flow of gas has been encountered
in a well near Antioch, which Is down
over 900 feet.
The Sunset - Oil Refining 1 Company Is
placing foundations for eight more stills
at its plant at Obispo* west of Long
Beach. The addition will double the ca
pacity of the plant, making sixteen 150
barrel stills in all. The dally capacity
will be about 1500 barrels.- At this plant
Illuminating oil is made exclusively from
California crude petroleum. The crude
oil used has a range from 16 to 28 grav
ity. About 25 per. cent is extracted in
the form of the new illuminating oil. The
product has been shipped- so far: only to:
Los Angeles and other Southern Califor
nia points. . ' \
A well will be drilled within the city
limits -of. Redding, Shasta -County.- Sur
veyor General Gleaves. is- interested in the
project,' so says the Redding Free Press.

County was ready for operations an In

The California Mining and Oil Com
pany has increased its capital stock "to
*5,000,000. ' This cor poration , is located at
Redding, Shasta County.
After receiving an opinion from Milton
McWhorter, it has been determined to
drill in Fresno County, between Lanes
bridge on the San Joaquln River and the
foothills. As a result 10,000 acres of land,
according to the Fresno Evening Demo
crat, have been bonded on both banks
of the San Joaauin' River.
The electric light plant at Sebastopol,
Sononia 1 County, will supplant wood with
oil for fuel. Two tanks will be erected
to contain respectively 30CC and 6000 gal
lons. Oil is cheaper and better than wood.
. Oil is reported to have been struck in
the middle of the Elkhorn Valley, in Kern
County. The valley is about twenty miles
long and from four to five miles wide.
Some account of San Benito wells .Is
given -by- the Hollister Bee, which says
tho Hamilton Oil Company, has drilled
down 150 feet, the San Benito County Oil
Company 985 feet, the Esmeralda 50 feet
and the Ohio Oil Company 500 feet. La
Primera has put up a. derrick. The Lon
don Oil Company t has closed a contract
for 160 acres. .
The Los Angeles Herald says:
A "successful experiment has been made in
pumping oil from a well in the Kern itlver
field with compressed air. This method has
been tried with success In the local Held, but
the first really satisfactory result in the north
ern field was in well No. 1 , of the Euclid Oil
Company. In the Kern River field the opera
tions, are troubled not a little with shifting
Ecnds. which fill up the casing, making it
necessary I to clean the hole every few days.
Under the new method the oil is forced up
from the bottom, and when properly handled
it cleans out the hole so fast that it is neces
sary to stop in order to let the hole fill. , The
hole Â¦was partly filled when the experiment was
tried, but in spite of it from the start the
well was made to produce more than "when it
was first put on the pump. The result of
the experiment is viewed with much satisfac
tion by the operators, who declare that com
pressed air pumping will revolutionize the
business. : " ...
An oil seepage Is reported to have been
discovered in Modoc County.
The directors of , the Stock Exchange at
Bakersfield have, called for bids for con
struction of the proposed building, which
will be opened, next Wednesday. The
architects are McDougall Brothers of San
Francisco. â¢Â¦ The structure will be four
stbries with basement." -It will stand at
the corner of H and Nineteenth streets.
The effect of the decision of Secretary
of War Root, permitting the continuance
of drilling for oil off the California coast,
in the ocean, is in accord with the ruling
of the Superior Court in Santa Barbara
County. This was that the War Depart
ment can grant a permit to drill under
the ocean, ; but the courts will not allow
the application of a permit in front of an
other person's property. - .
Dr. J. M. West writes to the Red Blurt
r>aily People's Cause that he and a com
pany are about to begin, operations on a
tract of 1000 acres-west of Red Bluff and
that a sufficient number of wells will be
drilled^ to fully demonstrate the existence
or non-existence 6f oil ! in that locality.
He has been . considering : the proposition
about a year. Â¦ *
The Spokane Chronicle says Spokane
and Kalispell men will drill in the valleys

By the filing of a quitclaim deed yester

RECTAL DISEASES
SUFFERERS FROM PILES AND
Have Now a Simple but Effective
Modern medical science and skill has
at last succeeded in' producing a remedy
which effectually cures that common but
extremely annoying trouble, piles. *
The Pyramid Pile Cure is the remedy
referred to and repeated and thorough
trials of the remedy during the past three
years have demonstrated that It is the
long sought for remedy which can be de-
pended upon as a genuine cure. There
are many remedies which give relief, but
such relief is only temporary and the
trouble soon - returns, as bad or worse
than ever. But the Pyramid Pile Cure
stands practically alone as a lasting cure.
It not only gives immediate relief but the
relief- is there to stay. . i Â¦ .
Mr. J. W. Rollins writes briefly and to
the point regarding his experience with
piles. He says: "1 consider the Pyramid
Pile Cure. without an equal. It cured-me
in less than thirty days. I waited fifteen
days or more to be sure the remedy had
fully cured me before writing you. I "can
now say I am cured and I shall recom-
mend the Pyramid Pile Cure at every pos-
sible opportunity because it deserves it."
We r:uote from this gentleman's letter
to- show our readers how promptly the
remedy a<?ts and also that there Is no re-
turn of the trouble.
"The Pyramid' Pile Cure Is simple and
harmless, containing purely vegetable in-
gredients, and can be used In all cases
with Â¦ perfect safety and with the assur-
ance that a cure will follow. Physicians
prescribe it and use it in all cases of piles
in preference to the danger' and uncer-
tainty of a surgical operation.. It cures
without pain or Inconvenience of any kind
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is prepared by
the Pyramid Drug Co. of Marshall, Mich.,
and sold by druggists everywhere at 50c
per package, making it the safest, surest,
cheapest pile cure before the public and
one you can try with -almost certain suc-
cess. ' , Â¦. Â¦ Â¦ .â¢Â¦:'â¢* Â¦-;

SAN FRANCISCO BOYS
â¢IN JAIL AT SEATTLE
Three Members of a Gang of Young
Thieves Placed Under Lock
and Key.
SEATTLE, April 6.â Three members of a
gang of . boys from San Francisco, who
have been making a precarious living
since their arrival from that city some
weeks ago, were arrested by Detective
Powers to-day in a disreputable lodging
house on Main street in this city. ! The
room in which they were arrested is said
to be a notorious resort for petty thieves
and it is claimed by. the police that, a
gang of about fifteen boys, all from San
Francisco, made this room their head
quarters.
| The three boys arrested gave their
names as Harry Goldstein, Eddie Miller
and John Sullivan. When they were ar
raigned in the Police Court they frankly
admitted that their actions had brought
them within the notice of the Police De
partment several times and that they
were only three of a regularly organized
gang. They did not admit any specific
crime, however.
Judge George questioned them' closely
about their homes and parents. Miller
and .Sullivan gave â the desired informa
tion, but Goldstein remarked that he did
not know his father's name. While the
Judge was questioning one of the others
Goldstein remarked sotto voce to one of
his companions:
"I don't want no blood head in a Frisco
paper about a tough aid for the old man's
benefit."
The Judge threatened to send him to the
reform school if he did not answer and
the boy did so. His parents will be com
municated with. The three boys were
sentenced to twenty days in' jail and an
effort will be made by the Police Depart
ment to locate their relatives In San
Francisco.
New Township Formed.
SANTA ROSA, April 6.â The Board of
Supervisors to-day voted to divide Sonoma
Township, making a new district to be
known as Glen Ellen Township. Another
Justice of the Peace will be appointed
and the change also calls for a new con
stable. The action was, taken principally
on account of the Sunday picnics held at
Glen Ellen during the summer months.
The new officials have not yet been
named. .- : v '
child's neck was broken and her skull
crushed In.
Marshal Kennedy of Walkerville :was
in the crowd and at once arrested
Warne. He managed with great diffi
culty to get the man away from the
scene, as the crowd had already begun
to talk of lynching. On the way to the
County Jail in this city Warne said the
Sirl. had turned over a gasoline stove.
Since then he* has refused to talk.
To-night, when the story got to be
more widely known and there were more
men away from work, active steps were
taken to organize a lynching party. At
the County Jail it was stated that the
Sheriff, fearing something of the kind,
had taken his prisoner to the penlten
tentiary at Deer Lodge for safe keeping.
BUTTE, Mont., April 6.â Evelyn Blewitt.
aged 9 years, daughter of Mrs. Blewitt, a
widow of Walkerville, was murdered this
afternoon In the cabin of the watchman
at the Walkerville reservoir and the place
is then believed to have been set on flre
with the evident purpose of concealing the
evidence of the crime.' John Warne, the
watchman, who Is 71 years old, is under
arrest, charged with the murder, and In
the excited state of feeling in Walkerville
to-night there might be a lynching if the
prisoner could be got at. Warne 1 s cabin
Is somewhat isolated and on numerous oc
caslons he has been known to Induce the
children who came near to enter the
place. Yesterday he told the little Blew
itt child that If she would come around
to-day he would give her a nickel. This
much Is known and is admitted by the
prisoner.
At 2:30 this afternon the cabin of Warne
â¢was seen to be in flames, and the Walker
vllle fire department was called out. When
the apparatus arrived, accompanied by a
large crowd of citizens, Warne was stand-
Ing outside the cabin, apparently uncon
cerned. He had not even raised an alarm.
By the time the' fire department could get
water on the cabin it was practically in
ruins. It was not until ten minutes after
the arrival of the department that Warne
told the firemen there was a little girl ln
eide. Some of those present made a rush
for the door, and wuhm on a bed they
found the body of the girl. It was badly
burned, one foot failing off as the rescuers
picked the child from the bed. Upon get
ting the body outside it was seen that the
Depositors Reach Agreement.
SAN JOSE, April 6.â The non-suing de
positors of the Insolvent Union Savings
Bank to-day agreed to relinquish the
stockholders of the institution from all
further liability if they would pay an as
sessment of $50 per share. This indorses
the plan of settlement proposed by the
organized depositors and will tend^ to an
early closing of the affairs of the bank.

afternoon on Â» complaint . of . his wife, who

sued by Justice James for. Wallace's ar
rest. . .
Mrs. Wallace has always ? borne . an ex
cellent reputation and her friends declare
that the estrangement is. not due to her
acts, but to the dissipation of her hus
band: Wallace was in considerable trou
ble a year or two ago. He was charged
with issuing bogus checks, and while the
case was pending it was supposed he had
gone East. Instead he had gone to San
Diego" County, where he waited J until the
storm swept by. He accumulated num
erous debts, which have caused him much
trouble. Until he became involved he was
regarded as a man of standing among,the
foremost ranchers of the county, i
Justice James fixed the -- bond of I Mr.
Wallace at ?1000.

letter, which was typewrlten, the 5 type
being of a large size, was as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal.
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Tilley, Capitalist,
Nevada City â Dear Sir: "We want from you
five hundred. If we don't get it both of you
will be murdered and. your property destroyed
by fire. Remember, if you tell this to . any
one at all you will not be spared under any
consideration. Put money in sack (all in gold)
and leave it at your front cate. There are
five in our sang and if you don't do just as
we say you know Just what will become of
you. We have traveled all over the United
States doing tMs business. One day one party
tried to fool us and he did not catch any of
us then, and instead has never been heard of
since. We will leave a small piece of ribbon
when we get the dough, so you will know that
we get it all rieht. This will be dropped in
your yard and the money must be delivered
the following day. We mean Just what we
say.
There is no signature to. the letter. Mr.
Tilley was at first disposed to treat the
affair as a joke, but a little investigation
soon convinced him that whoever had de
posited the letter evidently was in earnest
in the attempt to blackmail him. One of
the neighbors reported . having . seen a
stranger prowling around the Tilley home
on the evening before the letter was
found. - â¢
Having discovered that It was In reality
an attempt to scare him into giving up a
portion of his gold,* the old miner was at
a loss as to how to proceed. He was
afraid that If he reported the affair to the
authorities, the culprits might In a spirit
of revenge carry out their threat against
the lives and property of himself and
wife. For â¢several days he kept his coun
sel, but to-day he resolved to Invoke the
aid of the officials to. run down the black
mailers, and, if necessary, grant him pro
tection. An Investigation Is now being
conducted. Enough evidence has been pro
duced to prove conclusively that the
blackmailing letter was . not the produc
tion of a practical joker. It is doubted
that the culprits will carry out their
threat to harm Mr. Tilley or his wife, but
a lookout Is being kepi to prevent any
attack upon them. - '. â¢Â¦'

known reef.
Two of the crew were saved and landed
at Singapore. Vairaatea Reef was a long
way out of the Anrola's course, but ship

blow down there in one of the hurricanes

GRAPE-NUTS.
Did You Ever Try This One P
Everybody you meet on tho streets now-
adays either haa just nad the grip, is com-
ing down with it or has s sure cure for it.
The disease has "been a puzzle to physi-
cians ever since Its appearauce several
years ago and it Is as much of a puzzle
to-day as it was then. It exhibits such a
variety of symptoms in different individ-
uals . and leaves such disastrous results
after apparent recovery that aa yet its
prevention and euro has baffled medical
science.
However, there is no doubt but that the
grip is catarrhal in character and the
leading symptom in nearly every case Is
Increased secretion in the head and throat;
in fact, the first indications of la gripps
are those of a cold in the head which ex-
tends to the throat and lungs.
Dr. Johnson Ames advises as the safest
course to pursue on the first appearance
of grip symptoms to keep to the house for
a day or two and take Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets every hour th> first day and every
two hours the following day and' states
that this will break up the trouble befors
it becomes deep seated.- â¢ . . â¢ -
These catarrh tablet? are antiseDtic and
harmless and prevent fever and the fur-
ther development of grip germs and ward
off the ever present danger of pneumonia.
Dr. Gerald Simpson says: "I have
found Stuart's Catarrh Tablets a pleasant
and thoroughly .reliable remedy for tho
criD especially with elderly people with
whom this prevailing disease Is always
Â«angerous; the tablets can be found at
anv drug store and if 'used freely durinar
the first few days of the attack will break
La ' grippe is a catarrhal affection, the
~erms are In the air ana no one Is proof
apainst It, but the timely use of Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets will prevent any serious
results. â¢' Â¦ ' â¢â¢â¢-"''Â¦

is not like the common rolled wheat or
rolled oa.ts. but it is in the form of gran-
tiles, ranging from the size of a pin head
up to twice or three times that size.
It Is thoroughly cooked at the factory
and requires no preparation whatever, but
can be served instantly with hot milk or
hot cream to make a hot mush or cold
cream can be poured in the side of the
saucer and a very delicious crisp food is
the result. Not only is the taste fascinat-
ing, but the nutritive value of the food
is very great, as shown by the improved
condition physically and mentally of those
who use it ten days or two weekn.

O. A. TVKITMOE, Secretary. , . : .
The proper course for the Civil Service
.Commission to pursue would be to order
Â¦another examination for street inspectors
and-not for the particular position of In
spector of street sweepings. It is obvious
that Dutton would have a better knowl
edge-'of* the specific duties of the latter
position and would â¢ without doubt pass
the examination, though he ', failed for
street Inspector. "Whether, the Civil Serv
ice Commission will lend itself, to! such a
barefaced attempt to evade the civil serv
ice clause in the charter remains, to be
seen, but from the present attitude of the
members thereof the . little scheme con
cocted by the Board of Public Works to
retain men who held positions and failed
to pass the examinations therefor will be
nipped in the bud. Â¦ - .
the Board of Public Works
sfcnt a communication to the Civil Service
Commission stating that no change would
be 1 made in the position until the new
specifications for street sweepings were
adopted by the Board j of Supervisors,
'which would be next month. It further
said that Mr. Dutton's intimate knowledge
of the duties was such tiiat it would be
better, for the city's interests to . retain
:him until then.' Considering that Dutton's
duties- consist in seeing whether certain
streets are swept a specified number of
times in accordance with the schedule,
the Civil Service Commission fails to see
where, his expert duties come in.;, j
vf;: May Order New Examination.
', I In the meantime' the ! iBoard of Works
expects that the commission will order a
new. examination in order- to give Dutton
an opportunity to get on the eligible list.
The commission has so far taken no ac
tion, but In, view of the unfavorable criti
cism, which such a course would entail it
.is disinclined' to accede to the. request of
the Board of Public Works.
. A new phase of Â«, the controversy be
tween the two boards also, developed
when the Board of Public Works tiled
an official reaueat that a new examina
tion - be . ordered for inspector of street
sweepings, which, position Zhitton holds.
The Civil Service Commission, in answer
to the communication, stated that Dutton,
at the "special instance of the Board of
Works, had taken the examination â¢ for
Inspector s of streets when it was held
some months ago. Dutton was one of the
twelve names submitted by the Board of
Works as holding the positions of street
and sewer inspectors some time before tha
examination was held. Upon the report
of the Board of Works the questions to
be asked the applicants for the positions
were formulated. It was not stated then
that Dutton was being employed in a spe
cial capacity or that his duties were any
different than those of the eleven others.
When Dutton failed to pass the examina
tion he was retained in the position, and
in order to secure a permanency of tenure
for Dutton- the Board of Works wants the
Civil Service Commission, to hold another
examination for inspector of street sweep
ings. -:Â¦ Â¦ . -
New Phase of the Controversy.
Much correspondence on the subject has
passed between the Board, of Works and
the Civil Service Commissioners. The
latter have insisted that the civil service
provisions of the . charter be followed out
in the appointments, but have been in a
measure placated by the notification that
the twelve eligible street inspectors have
all been put to work after having been
certified by the commission. As there
were only twelve inspectors employed by
the Board of Public Works previous to
the announcement of the civil service eligi
ble list this would necessarily exclude
Dutton and McMahon from appointment.
This, however, did not bother the Board
of Public Works in the least. It selected
the twelve names certified by the com
mission and continued LHitton and Mc-
Mahon in their positions as inspectors,
notwithstanding that they had both failed
to pass the civil service examination.
That the various boards" and commis
sions appointed by Mayor Phelan have
discovered numerous ways by which to
evade the , civil service provisions of the
charter? which- they are all pledged to
observe, was again brought to light yes
terday. The Board of Public Works, in
its anxiety to reward political favorites
who had failed in the civil service exam
ination for street and sewer inspectors,
has simply increased the number of such
officials In its employ from twelve to four
teen. The men - who profit by the action
of the board are George W. Dutton and
Lawrence McMahon, who are not on the
civil service eligible list for the positions,
but nevertheless have been retained in
their, old positions. .

HOPE TO MAKE

Building Trades Council
Tells What It Demands

Harris and Emanuel the Only Men

. The Building Trades Council will make
a special effort to-day to make its boy- :

bearing signs proclaiming the boycott will
be on the streets, ; and - members of the
building " trades unions will be near, the
gates to warn " away any of their fellow
members who may seem disposed to en
ter. The -refusal of the Labor Council, to
indorse the boycott haa spurred the other
organization to greater vigilance.
'. The executive committee of the Building
Trades Council has issued the following
statement: , ."-â¢_â¢ . - ':Â¦'Â¦'Â¦ ..
To the Editor of "The Callâ Dear Sir:- i The
baseball magnates are Industriously, circulating
reports to the effect that the boycott on the

reports, no matter from whom * they may em

Building Trades Council on : Manager Harris
and his baseball concerns on account of . his
unfair acts toward jthe Building Trades Coun
cil and his avowed antagonism to union labor
is on the baseball league to stay until Manager

JAMES D. POWEH, SPECIAL
TREASURY AGENT, EXPIRES
Disease Contracted While on Duty in
the Philippines Ends Life of
Popular Official.
James D. Power, special agent of the
treasury, stationed at this port, died in
St. Mary's Hospital at a quarter past 7
o'clock yesterday morning.
Mr. Power went to Manila four and a
half months ago for the purpose of look-
Ing into the management of the customs
a.t that port. He was at that time in per
fect health and apparently in the Dink
of condition, but shortly before leaving
Manila to return to the United States he
â¢was prostrated with abscess of the liver.
He was so weak and emaciated when he
reached Honolulu that the physicians In
sisted that it would not be safe for "him
to continue the voyage, but he refused
to be put off at Honolulu and demanded
that he be allowed to proceed to this city,
Â¦where his wife and children were await
ing him. Mr. Power arrived on the Hong
kong Maru two "weeks ago last Friday,
fciid was so debilitated that it was neces
sary to remove him from the steamship
in an ambulance to St. Mary's Hospital.
An operation was performed last Friday,
which he sustained heroically, but his
system had become too much enfeebled to
rally from the shock.
Mr. Power leaves a wife, two sons and
Iwo daughters. His eldest son is Neal
Power, an attorney of this city. *
Ryan was very reticent about the mat
ter and would not state whether or not
the company intends fighting the recent
advance Â¦ in : the assessment - rate of rail
road property. The advance is 20 per cent.
E. Black Ryan, an attorney of the
Southern Pacific, returned yesterday frcrn
Nevada, where he was attending to the
company's business in reference to the
assessment' In Nevada of railroad prop â¢
A. C. Luck, greneral manager and treas
urer of the Nevada Central Railroad with
headquarters at Austin. Nev., arrived in
this city yesterday. Luck, who has nine
ty-three miles of railroad under his super
vision, is "kicking" at what he deems the
"njuft. assessment levied upon it hI de
elded upon, a plan of attack which would
Â£r k â¢rÂ£ Sta T te Controller of NevaoVplead
for mercy. Luck sent several missives to
prominent railroad officials in this dtv >
Wtaf m f oLe a n n t. lnterVleW U Â»Â° n *^&
It is believed Luck was in the hope
he could form with the Southern Padttc
Company a combination that would make
the Controller erovel in the sagebrusivand
beg for mercy. After inhaling volumes
of smoke from an English briaF root Slut
he Journeyed to the railroad buildinl to
have a consultation with some of the
prominent officials of the Southern Pa
cific. They all seemed to be out. *
Ll i ck J eft } he bu Â»ding and to-morrow

The undersigned respectfully â¢ suggest that
for a long time the fee system of the city
and county, as by various laws and ordinances
prescribed, has not been verified or checked
off with the Auditor - and Treasurer of the
city, and although Cyril "Williams is the ex

it is Impossible for him with his present duties
to properly. attend, to this necessary branch of

Finance Committee to provide a snug

| In its report the Finance Committee rec
ommends that Gordon be appointed a?
fee expert during the months of May and
June at a salary- of $100 per month. Shoula
his services be found necessary . the ap
pointment : is to be continued I durinpr the
next fiscal year by a special provision in
the next tax budeet.
Again, there is no mentioa in the char
ter of any special clerk whose duty it
shall be to verify the fee system. .. It. Is
simply an affair between the official who
collects the fee and who Ts liable â¢ on his
bond and the City Treasurer.
This action was taken notwithstanding
that the charter prohibits the creation of
any position not authorized by its Â¦ spe
cific provisions. The svstem by 'which 'a
check is kept of' the coi'ection of fees Is
such that there is no :ieed of any one tu
supervise their collection. Daily returns
are made* to the Treasurer, who. by a
system of numbered fee : books arranged
in triplicate form, is enabled to keep a*
strict account of all- fees collected by the
Recorder, Countv Clerk, Justices' cle.rk,
Board of Public Works and other branches
of the municipal â¢ government. These
books are distributed by the Auditor, who
keeps zealous watch over them, r
Considerable unfavorable^ criticism has
been excited by the action of the Grand
Jury in using its official fosltlon to secure
for one of its own members a position un

request was made that Grand Juror Jo

PLANS FOR NEW HOME
Experts Striving to Decipher
Peculiar Entries Made
by Sullivan.
Charter Bed Tape Prevents With
drawal of Deposits, Officials Be-'
ing Unwilling to Assume
â¢ Â¦ Responsibility.
Another piece of bookkeeping jugglery
was discovered yesterday in the office of
\Varrant and Bond Clerk Peery. Dan Sul
livan's retentive memory of bails deposited
Etood the office in good stead, and after
hours of quiet research it was discovered
that although the books showed that tne
entry of the bail money had been trans
ferred from the books of Department 4
to those of Department 2 the money had
been left untouched in the city treasury.
On September 5, 1900, Frank Stewart,
Ellas Frank Jones, was arrested for a fla
grant misdemeanor. He was convicted by
Judge Cabaniss the following day and
to the County Jail for five
months. After serving ten days an ap
peal was taken, and cash ball to the
amount of $125 was deposited by his at
torney. The records show that the money
was credited to Police Court 2 Instead of
Police Court L
When the experts went over the books
they found a complete history of tne case
with the exception of the deposit of the
bail money. Sullivan was appealed to by
Peery's deputies, and he fortunately re
membered the disposition of the money.
The books of the Treasurer and the
County Clerk agree that the money was
paid out in payment of his fine. After
the appeal was decided last month his
sentence cf 150 days or JIM was settled
by the substitution of his bail money, the
payment of $15 additional and a credit of
Ten days in jail. One peculiar circum
stance that is keeping the experts guess
ing is why the bail should be entered on
the register of Police Court 2 instead of
Police Â«_ourt 4. None of the attaches of
the warrant and bond clerk's office can
explain it, except by saying that it was
put on tne book of the other court because
they did not know to what court it right
lull y belonged.
The experts who are going over the
books find many discrepancies, "but de
cline to make public the present status of
their examinations, for the reason that
until all the entries are compared a posi
tive determination cannot be reached. The
task is a tedious one, involving a consid
erable amount of clerical worK and fig
uring. The records of the Police Depart
ment prove to lie of invaluable aid.
ine complications about the payment
out of the treasury of bail money is caus
ing no end of trouble and confusion
County Clerk Deane yesterday had court
orders representing &ji) for fines orderec
held from hail. Treasurer Brooks refused
to accept them, and advised Chief Deputy
County Clek Goddard to have the Auditoi
"O. K." them It-fore he would have tlu
money transferred from the bail fund tc
the fine fund.
CJoddard called on Auditor Wells, and
The latter refused to have anything to do
"with the matter, as he claims that bail
money, of v/hich he has no official cogniz
ance. Is practically a* special deposit. So
unless the matter is settled with the
Treasurer before the end of the \ month
the County Clerk will be technically
"phort" the amount of money In the city
treasury covered by the orders of the Po
lice Judges to transfer the money from
one fund to another. City and County
Attorney Lane has been appealed to in
order that theGordian knot in the red tape
of the municipal financial system, adopted
under the new charter, may be untied or
cut.
Writs of mandate and other legal pro
cesses are also talked about, but no one
seems prepared to furnish the ready
means by whicr. those who are entitled to
the return of their money can secure it.
Treasurer Brooks is obdurate, so are the
Police Judges, and in the meanwhile the
coin is piling up in the treasury.
Prior to the appearance of Sullivan be
fore Judge Cab'aniss yesterday morning
The latter went out to see Mayor Phelan,
to ask that a Justice of the Peace be as
signed to his department to preside over
the preliminary examination of Sullivan.
He met Secretary Fay, who after hearing
the reasons which Judge Cabanlss ad
vanced promised to lay the matter before
Mayor Phelan. Judge Cabaniss feels that
he is disqualified to sit at the hearing, as
he is an interested party, one of the
largest demands being that on which
Judge Cabaniss disputes his signature.
Sullivan appeared in court none the
â¢worse for his alleged Illness of the day
before. After r.n explanation from Judge
Cabaniss of his position In the case and
his visit to the Mayor's office, it was de
oided to continue the hearing of the Sul
livan case until next Wednesday, by
which time it is hoped that Mayor Phelan
will have designated a Justice of the
Peace to sit.
Members of the Grand Jury are taking
considerable interest in the matter. Fore
man Dunker and W. E. Lutz were at the
Hall of Justice yesterday and questioned
captain Seymour and the experts as to
their discoveries. An attempt will be
made to secure the names of those who
profited by Sullivan's peculations and who
are generally considered the cause of his
latest downfall.

By T. E. MTJLHOLLA1TD.
â¢r< yD HAPPIER man could be found
f^k I about Tanforan track yesterday
I than Barney Schreiber, the St.
A N Louis breeder and bookmaker.
'Â¦' Barney had double cause for re
joicing. Corrigan, the brown s*on of Imp.
Sain, carrying 123 pounds, . bred at his
Woodlands! stud, took .the .Colts,' Second
Trial Stakes, valued at $1045, and Zirl, a
black daughter of the same sire and play
mate of Corrigan, defeated a fleet field of
misses for . the Fillies' Second Trial
Stakes, worth a gross valuation of $1005.
Both were'trained by, and ran In the name
of ex-Jockey-Felix Carr. who made his
reputation as an honest, and redoubtable
rider in the Schreiber colors., Each-stake
winner was in turn piloted by the peerless
lightweight Dominick, who distinguished
himself further.by landing two other win
ners during the afternoon. .
Despite the fierce trade'winds that
sweep the,course these spring days, .an
excellent, inning "of sport was witnessed by
a large and appreciable crowd. It origin
ally looked like a favorite card, but rac
ing is uncertain, for Corrigan and Eonic
were the only short-priced ones success
ful. Undoubtedly the saddest blow ad
ministered to tbe talent was when. The
Fretter led out the unlucky Tellowtail in
the closing event. The steeplechase fell
to Negligence, a 25 to 1 outsider. ,
Only two absentees were noted from the
Colts' Trial Stake, I .which I left Corrigan
to canter to the post a 2 to 5 choice.- Â¦ Over
at' the" barrier he caused his backers some
anxiety by "displaying a tendency not to
line up. .= He broke through when the
time came and for half a mile was given
a merry chase by E. M: Brattain. Domi
nick drew his whip on the favorite and.it
worked wonders. Responding instan
taneously and catching the. Stanfield en
try, he won by three lengths in :55.' Roy
alty came from, the rear, finishing third.
Beyond question- Sister :Jeanie would
have ruled a pronounced favorite for the
filly ' stake. Unfortunately for. Walter
Jennings, she ran away* two miles while
being galloped Â¦ in the morning and was
scratched. Doreen, Â¦ from the Burns . &
"Waterhouse stable, then enjoyed first call
at even money, although it was her first
out in many weeks. She was outfooted
at the start and then pocketed on the
rail, losing all chance. Dominick on
Zirl rapidly overtook Ishtar, winning all
the way in :55#. Driving hard, Howell,
astride Flora Pomona, snatched the place
from the choice by a head.
Owner Ab Stemler felt confident his filly
Eonic would win- the. first event at seven
furlongs, and from even money the odds
were soon swiped to 7 to 10. Showing first
soon after the start, she experienced little
difficulty in passing Tenny Belle and won
easily. Tony Lepping ran third. Thorn
wild sulked from the start.
There was actually some semblance of
a contest to the steeplechase, resulting in
the win of Negligence, a 20 to 1 outsider,
with Worthington ' in the saddle. Lord
Chesterfield, the lightweight of the party,
took all of the obstacles in front, but
when it came; to the final sprint on the
flat Negligence had the most speed as
well as gameness. Periwig, the favorite,
was crowded on the rail the last hundred
yards, but was then "all in." Old Flash
light was started, and after displaying
some soeed early in the game -went an
awful cropper. . \ > . - - Â¦
Charley Ellison's Astor had a decided
calling In the betting- on the mile and a
sixteenth selling number, his price drop
ping from 6 to 5 to 9 to 10." Breaking away
in front as usual, the gelding led to the
paddock, when he was collared and easily
beaten by Goldone. against which 4 to 1
was laid. Ttedwald, pulling up very lame,
finished In the show. ,
Sam Hildreth for some reason concluded
to -set The Lady excused from* the final
mile run, leaving a new favorite to Â«/e
found in Yellowtall. Captain.' HacKett's
big fellow had only to carry 106 pounds
and was plunged on at 7 to 10. Again he
cut out the running, only to be overhauled
and downed the last few strides by The
Fretter. The latter horse shouldered 115
pounds and "Ole Man" Thorpe gave him
one of his best efforts. Rosormonde iwas
the only other starter. :Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦ â¢ -." ;
Track Notes.
Much complaint was heard on all sidea
over the discontinuance of. the 4:15 train
to the city. The management should not
be so indifferent to the wants' of race
goers.
Dominick, on Tellowtail, lodged a claim
ofi foul against Thorpe, which was not al
lowed.
Charley Thorpe- was -entitled to much
credit for his splendid ride on The Fret
ter. Probably had the track been faster
Tellowtail would have been harder to
catch. :'.â¢".-"- . '.
Imp. Sain, the sire of Corrigan and- Zirl,
was purchased In California by Barney
Schreiber and bids fair to become one of
the sensational sires of the country. The
black horse was brought to this country
by the late Marcus Daly and through his
veins r courses the blood dearest to Â¦ stu
dents'-of breeding.
Â¦ Dominick has certainly been the hit of
t-he California racing season, and if -in
creasing weight does not retire him from
the saddle early has a brilliant future^be
fore him. A perusal of -the Vdope" book
speaks worlds for the little fellow, for he
was always there or knocking on all kinds
and all priced horses. - . ;
A windfall in the shape of $352 50 in run
up money was added to the purse for the
fifth event.

CITY GOLF TEAM

All but One of the Local Bepresenta-

Opponents.
The first half of the second home-aind
home match between teams representing
the â¢ San Francisco f and Oakland Â¦ Golf
clubs was played yesterday afternoon on
the Presidio, links, and resulted In the
city team obtaining the substanlal lead of
22 up. Owing to the absence of H. D
Plllsbury and L.' O. KellogrgT, two new
men were included in the San Francisco
team. These were H. . C. Golcher -and
Warren Gregory: The latter beat his od
ponent, Arthur Goodall, 1 up, but H. C
Golcher lost 2 down to C. P. Hubbard of
Oakland. Five of the San Francisco team
scored against their opponents, the best
score being made by S. L. Abbot Jr., who
defeated F. S. Stratton 8 up. J. W. Byrne
beat R. M. Fitzgerald 6 up and John Law
son was. 6 up against W. P. Johnson. I In

disconcerted the visiting, team. The full
details are given below.
captured, the first of
{T Â¦ ,the intercollegiate baseball games
(I â¢[.- from Stanford yesterday , by a
score of 9 to 6. " The contest
was waged on the Berkeley dia
mond before a large crowd of students
and their fair friends. While the game
was not of a championship order, there
were .enough, exciting plays to arouse the
pent-up enthusiasm of the rooters. The
Berkeley boys played all round the vis
itors from Palo Alto, but the poor show
ing of the latter. may be attributed to un
familiar! ty. with the grounds -across the
bay. '
Stanford made a valiant effort to secure
the victory, but: the heavy stickwork and
excellent fielding of .the blue." and gold
players won the day. Both teams labored
under a nervous strain throughout the
match. This in a way accounts for the
many' errors scored by each side. Braly
at third -for. California and Lowenthal and
Murphyiof Stanford made the glaring er
rors. Braly had hard chances, and
coupledwith them was the fact that the
ground in the vicinity of his cushion was
covered with myriads of small rocks that
made the ball bound in all directions.
Lowenthal' s errors were glaring. He
dropped two long flies, which if captured
would have cut off as many runs. Mur
phy's errors were due to eagerness and
not to poor playing, as Stanford's famous
quarterback did excellent work in the
third corner* v
When the game opened the grand stands
were filled ..with pretty girls and rooters.
The colors of both institutions of learning
were there in profusion, and lusty voiced
youths made the welkin ring with their
college cries and derisive yells. The day
was an ideal one for the national- game.
Stanford won the toss and went first to
bat. The players were retired In short
order and the ! noise ! became incessant.
Berkeley's heavy batters marched up to
the plate and lighted on Mr. Parker's
shoots with an abandon that was ap
palling. Before It became a slaughter

California had scored four hits and threÂ«
men had tagged the rubber. Stanford se
cured two in the next Inning and Berke
ley landed another tally when they came
to bat. It was in the fifth that Stanford
not only tied the score but went the blue
and gold aggregation two better. It was
a regular balloon ascension for Stanford,
and when they came to earth at the close
of the inning- the cardinal supporters were
jubilant. Their joy was short-lived, how
ever, as the Berkeley boys evened up mat
ters and clinched the game in the next
two innings.
Overall's pitching was not the best In
the world. He was steady. . but did not
warm up until near the close of the game.
Parker was extremely nervous at times
and went up in the air. When he got into
the game he pitched fairly good ball. The
fielding of Kennedy in left field and
Gardiner's playing at first were features
of the game, as was also the brilliant
catch made by Edwards at short early in
the contest. The antics of "Micky" Mc-
Keown and Kennedy on the coaching line
were irresistibly funny and were hugely
appreciated by the spectators.

"I'm not a lobster nor a % red dog,"
chirped Devereaux in the second Inning
as he held Pabst a few feet from the sec
ond bag, which the latter did not reach,
and was" consequently called out by the
umpire, "but I would hate to tell you
what you are."" '
; "Tell it," said Pabst, "and I'll smite
your sweet young face." Then both
raised their bodies from the dust, looked
seven years' wars and were separated
from their fistic and lingual intentions
by peaceful Mr. Q'Conriell, the umpire.
-This was the third out. Then Devereaux
came to the bat and smiled sweetly as he
lost the ball in the left garden. As he
passed the first; bag, over which Pabst
presides, the "red dog" hissed between
his teeth,; "Nasty young man."
That was the, only episode of a furious
nature in the game yesterday afternoon.

The^prettiest fielding work of the day
was the nipping in the bud of an attempt
ed double steal. Mclaughlin decked the
third sack,, Doyle the first. Doyle started
to purloin second, and quick as a flash
Oraham shot the ball down to Krug.
Doyle foresaw ruin and stopped midway
between the. bags andMcLaughlin began
to work homeward. .Krug then threw
to Reilly on third, bottling up McLaugh

in the field. ...

gathering in three runs on two hits in

nothing but outs. Score:

EASY FOR THEM
CALIFORNIA DEFEATS STANFORD
IN AN EXCITING BASEBALL GAME
24
After having a round dozen of short
ends thrust at them, the form players at
Union Coursing Park were given a parting
shot yesterday In the defeat of Roman
Athlete by the Australian hound. The
Chief.
ThÂ© Pasha Kennels' top-notcher was
made a strong favorite over thÂ© Anti
podean, 4 to 1 being the ruling price. Like
all other newcomers, The Chief had a
"rep" to sustain and so far as'thÂ© fig
ures go was equal to the task. When the
red flag went up the stranger had the big
end of a 6 to 3 score and the pikers were
JoyfuL Despite the fact that thÂ© win
ner was favored, his work showed that
bÂ« has considerable Â¦ cleverness in i his
make-up. Away with the advantage of
the slip and then with the hare swinging
to his favor. The Chief won out. But at
that it Is too early in bis local career to
eay In what class ne can travel.
Bisquoc has a good chance to be a con
testant in thÂ© last course in to-day's
finals. Two weeks ago the Petaluma
hound was beaten for tiret money by P.
J. Rellly's WarBhip after a close and ex
citing go. Yesterday Sisquoc evened old
scores. When thÂ© flag went up he had
one point to the good on his former con
queror. Â¦ â¢ - . . â¢ Â¦ -
Bona Fide Is a lively candidate and the
â¢winner of the Brutus-Royal Union course
In the second round will undoubtedly be
Â¦within reaching distance when the crowd
grcts ready to go home to dinner. Beacon
won by a narrow margin from Rollicking
Airs and tbe general opinion is that he
had. not enough to spare in his work to
warrant a backing as a stake favorite.
Mamie Pleasant beat out Rural Artist
at a good price. Erin got an unexpected
decision from Harlean Gladys. In both
events the losers were unsighted and were
beaten after joining In. Tiburon put up
a 6trong course against I'Teedom's Ban
ner and won out by a point.
Recording Angel at 7 to 1 beat Master
Lawrence pointless. She went up the
field in the lead, took the turn, followed
It out and killed, nothing was allowed
for speed. -?'.Â¦'*â¢'.â¢ ~- 4 -

The frightened animal dashed out of the
lot, dragging the boy over the ground.
The cries of the people in the vicinity at
tracted the attention of Poundmaster
Wharton. 'who spurred up his horse and
lassoed the runaway animal. Kind hards
cared for the lad and he was taken to his
home. . .'
Upon examination it was found that El

"His front teeth were knocked out and his
face and head were in a pitiable condition.
Elmer took two horses belonging to Jeff
Powers to. graze In a lot on the corner of
Market and Thirteenth -streets. In order
to better control the animals .he tied one
of the ropes around his waist and held the
other line in h's hand. The horses became
frightened and began to run away. The'
little fellow let go of one of the animals
and grabbed hold of the rope attached to
his body. ' ,
Ell mer, Hopkins, a boy 12 years of age,
living with his parents at 40 Albert alley,
had a narrow escape from death yester
day. But for the timely presence of
Poundmaster Wharton the little fellow

PREPARING THE TTTKTTrR.A-R.-y.
"WASHINGTON, April 6.â Secretary Cor
telyou is daily engaged in conferences
with Senators and Representatives and
railroad {officials regarding the itinerar y
of the President's cumins tour across thÂ«Â»
continent. As near as possible Secretary
Cortelyou is trying to complete the sched
ule before the train leaves on its long
journey. The time of returning to Wash
ington will be fixed almost to the hour
before the departure, despite the fact that
the train will be away from Washington
for six weeks and will travel 12,000 miles
and go through more than half the State*
of the Union. Reports receive*! at the
White House are that the entire West is
making preparations for the trip. H. T.
Scott of the Union Iron Works of San
Francisco, where the battleship Ohio "will
be launched, is coming to Washington to
accompany . the President to California.
He also has placed his magnificent resi
dence In San Francisco at the disposal
of the President.
In Los Angeles two prominent citizens
have tendered the use of their hou3es.
While these invitations may not be ac
cepted they show tne hospitality that'i3
being offered to the President. It is not
yet known whether Attorney Oeneral
Knox will accompany the party. He had
just returned from spending the winter
in California arid may not care to return.
With the exception of Secretary Gage and
possibly Secretary Root every other Cabi
net officer willÂ«go> Each one will transact
department business aboard the train,
just as If he was at his desk in Washing
ton. The President will bo In constant
communication with Washington and will
attend to all legislative. business. The ex
ecutive machinery of the Government
will, in fact, go alone: dally to the ac
companiment of the noise of the railroad
train.
While in "Washington State the FTesJ
dent has decided to stop at CThehalls, ths
home of the Hazzard brothers, the two
army officers who accompanied General
Funston upon the perilous journey which
effected the capture of Aguinaldo. The
President probably will make a br*ef
speech there. The proposed sail by steam
er from Duluth or Chicaso to Buffalo has
been eliminated from the itinerary owing
to the fact that the ' steamers do not be
gin to run until June lb After the trip
through the Yellowstone Park the party
will so to Salt Lake City, Utah, thence
to Denver and Colorado Springs. Two
davs will be spent at the latter dace In
order to allow time for a visit to Pike's
Peak. Stops will be/ made at Kansas City
and St. Joseph. No i extended stay will bo
made at Chicago. About two days will ba
spent at Buffalo via'ttn? the Pan-Ameri
can Exposition and Niagara Falls.
gation of the Good Samaritan Mission is
loath to part with Mr. Macon's services,
but joins in sincere congratulations for
what is considered in ecclesiastical circles
as a distinct promotion. Mr. Macon is
about 30 years of age and unmarried. He
will be ordained priest the coming June.
Strike a Rich. Xnsdge.
GRASS VALLEY, April 6.â The Buck
brotbers of Moores Flat have struck a
rich ledge In their mining property bn the
Middle Yuba, opposite the Plumbago. The
tunnel tapped a ledge three feet In thick
ness, which carries a wealth of free gold.
The ore Is so valuable that Instead of
milling it a hand-mortar is being used.
THE Cathedral Mission of the Good
Samaritan Is to lose . and Trinity
Church to gain the services of one
of the most promising of the
younger generation of Episcopal
clergymen. The Rev. Clifton Macon will
on 'Sunday next assume the curacy of
Trinity and act as assistant to Dr. t'lam
pitt. Mr. Macon is a native of Virginia
and comes of an old and distinguished
family. Until 1897 he was engaged in'ac
tive business pursuits, but yielding to a
strong, predilection for the church, he de
termined to become a clergyman. In the
same year he entered the Church Theo
logical Seminary at San Mateo, and after
three years' diligent application was or
dained deacon by Bishop Nichols in June
last. ,.
. Since October, 1899, Mr. Macon, has acted
as assistant at the Mission of the Good
Samaritan and has â¢ rendered valuable
service. Under his charge the Sunday
school of the mission has increased both
in numbers and discipline. As a reader
of the services of the church Mr. Macon
excels, and as a preacher his sermons
are distinguished for their directness,
force and . evident Â¦ sincerity, always
rhetorically correct and displaying study
and scholarship. In manner the new
curate of Trinity is true to the best tra
ditions of his native State, pleasing, cour
teous and- withal . modest. His voice is
quite adequate for the large church in
which he, is to administer. The congre-
Will Reimburse Nevada County. |
GRASS VALLEY, April 6.âFor several
years past the sum of $5985 54 has been due
Nevada County from the State on account
of moneys paid by the county for orphans
and half-orphans. "Word has been re
ceivod by County Clerk F. L. Arbogast
at Nevada City.that the money will soon
be paid back from the State treasury.
Â£an Francisco has to-day practically no debt
end OtMt is why she has no schools, no hospi
tal, no sewer system and no proper entrance
to her park from the city. The city is rich;
her future is secure and these Improvements,
which can be acquired on a 3% per cent basis
will repay her a hundred fold if ehe makes
them.
The gentlemen of the Improvement club
think that the dollar limit is a trifling- thins
that <tan be idly set aside. It Is the bulwark
of the charter against raids on the treasury.
The charter makers required a unanimous
Board of Supervisors and the Mayor to eus
pend it and then only in case of "great neces
eity or emergency." The Board of Super
visors are not the anal Judges of a. great emer
gency cr necessity. The City Attorney has al
ready advised the board, under date of March
.Â£. that the charter framers. In his opinion, in
tended that the dollar limit should only be
exceeded through fire, earthquake, war or some
similar calamity.
In conclusion the Mayor says:
Mayor Phelan argues that the ad
vantage of issuing bonds is that they will
permit the completion of Improvements
lor the benefit of the people now living.
The other plan, which he calls the "in
staJlment plan," keeps an improvement
jiartially completed for a long period.
The Mayor contends that it is good busi
ness to get money at 3>4 per cent by bond
issues instead of collecting large amounts
In taxes from taxpayers, to whom the
money is worth 6 or 7 per cent. Speak
ing of the dollar limit he says:
A statement has been Issued by Mayor
Fhelan In answer to certain criticisms of
the charter, -and particularly in reply to
the petition of an improvement club that
ail improvements be made out of the tÂ»v
levy. The Mayor states the amounts re
quired for improvements as follows:
Schools, U.400,000: sewers. $*,000,000; hospital,
J475,O<Xl; panhandle, $4,530,000.

Preferring Death to the Almshouse
He Shoots Himself Through
the Brain.
Wakeman Burr, nearly 70 years old, sick
and friendless, killed himself yesterday
forenoon rather than go to the Alms
house. He had been supporting himself
for some time by gathering and peddling
watercress, and among his patrons was
Miss Elliott of 2146 Sutter street. She no
ticed the old man's distress and Inquired
into his circumstances. When she sug
gested that she could have him admitted
to the Almshouse he refused to consent
at first, but finally agreed to enter that
institution if she could secure his admis
sion. Miss Elliott succeeded in getting
the necessary permission and informed
Burr that an express wagon would call
for bis baggage at 11 o'clock in the fore
noon at his room, 152a Buchanan street.
At that hour be placed the muzzle of a
cheap pistol to his right temple and pulled
the trigger, killing himself Instantly.
The expressman was late, and wh* n- he
got to the door he met the Morgue depu
ties bringing the body downstairs. As
they were placing the body in the dead
wagon Mi.ss Elliott arrived, and on being
infonr.etl what had happened she wept
out of sympathy for the lonely old man,
who preferred death to becoming a public
charge.

FOR TRAINMEN
SAN DIEGO, A^ril 6.â The Federal au
thorities here. are considerably excited by
the disclosures which have been made
through the coming to this coast of the
Chinese passengers on the Belgian King,
who have sought to land under the provi
sions of section 6 of the Chinese exclu-,
<feion act. â¢ â¢
Once more it has been demonstrated that
on the other side of the Pacific the silver
coins of the United States are being: coun
terfeited and that the counterfeit coin is
finding: Its way back to this country. How
great has been the traffic in the SDurious
coin is not known, but It seems that every
one of the forty-five Mongolians who
sought a landing here was supplied with
bogus American silver with which they
had been supplied -in small amounts at
Canton or Hongkong or whatever large
city on the other side ' they started from
on their trin across the water.
; The Chinese seem innocent enough as
far as the counterfeit coin Is concerned,
and the Federal officers do not believe
that they knew It was counterfeit. It
was discovered by Customs Inspector
Hubbs, to .whom some of it was given
; by the Chinese to purchase supplies for
them while they were detained on board
the vessel. '
1 The coins are all quarters and they are
i as heavy and evidently contain as much
silver as genuine coins. They have been
passed here several times over, as it was
not until after the Mongolians had been
here several days that the money was
given to Hubbs to purchase supplies. Oth
ers had received it before Hubbs and had
passed it out to the supply men without
any question as to Its genuineness. The
coin was taken to several of the banks,
and while one or two of them pronounced
it spurious others believed that it was all
ripht. The auarters are slightly concave,
indicating that they are molded Instead
df stamped with a die.
On Â¦questioning the Chinese who have
the spurious money it is found that they
simply supplied themselves with . what
they supposed was a small amount of the
coin of the country to which they were
coming in order that they might have
some money to spend for necessaries as
soon as they landed.
It is, they -say, just such coin as Is
current in circles where American money
is sometimes seen in Hongkong and
Canton, 'and none of them had any idea
that it was not genuine.
Upon the report made this afternoon
by Inspector R. J. Dunn of the Immi
gration Bureau only two of the forty
five Chinese brought here on- the Belgian
King were found to be entitled to land.
The remaining forty-three were "ordered
deported on the same steamer that
brought them. The investigation â¢ has
lasted two weeks, and in nearly every
case it was proved tliat the certificates
presented had been purchased from mer
chants in China. A strong guard was put
in charge of those , ordered deported.

Superintendent McLaren now has a su
perb collection of -orchids on view in the
conservatory building, and lovers of the
rare buds will find that it is well worth a
visit to the park to inspect these speci
mens of the epiphytes family. .
"The "library will be for park purposes
only," said Superintendent McLaren. "I,t
will not be a public library in
the general : sense of the term. It
will be devoted to horticultural subjects
and will be for the use of the park em
ployes and students of botany. The Idea
that the library, will have works of fiction
is erroneous."
At the next meeting of the Park Com
mission the architect will submit plans
for -the proposed park library. The, new
library will be- situated at the rear of the
park lodge and^ will, conform with the
architecture of the present- building.
"We are at present obliged to use large
quantities of water to prevent dust rising,
and the heat of the sun soon evaporates
the moisture. Dust is simply caused by
the travel, and any one who has seen the
result of using oil on roads in the south
will realize the great' benefit to be
achieved by using it in the park.
"If the experiment Is successful, as I
have every hope it will be, then we will
sprinkle all the ariveways in the park
with oil and add to the pleasure of those
who ride and drive, as well as those who
walk." â¢'
, As soon as the rainy season. Is over an
experiment will be. tried" in Golden. Gate'
Park to determine the 'utility "of- oil -for
sprinkling the park driveways. Superin
tendent McLaren is a firm believer! in "the
use of oil for laying dust on the roads.,
and has studied the matter carefully*. IHe^
has Inspected the work done inSquthern'
California and is enthusiastic on/the sub
ject. Superintendent McLaren said yes
terday: Â¦ , .' _ Â¦ ; . Â¦â¢' -.'.!"
"We will try the use of "oil on the road
ways of the park as soon as the rainy
season is over. We will cover 'a half-mile
of driveway with oil and -give it a thor
ough test. I have seen oil used for this
purpose in Southern California, and feel
confident that we will be successful here.
We propose to use the residuum of the oil
in the same manner as It Is applied in the
south. The residium is heated In a tank,
then run into a . sprinkling cart and
sprayed over the road. Three applications
are required before the roadway, will be
free from dust.

OIL TO BE USED

Customs Collector Stratton received a
leUer yesterday morning from H. A. Tay
lor, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury,
in response to the Collector's letter of
March 19, submitting with his approval
suggestions made by Chief Dunn, of the
Chinese Bureau for the prevention of
escapes from the Chinese detention shed
at the Mail dock, Mr. Taylor states that
Chief Dunn's suggestions â¢ have met -with
the approval of the department and re
quests the Collector to take such steps as
may be necessary to carry the suggestions
into effect.
The proposition Is to appoint a Chinese
inspector to take charge of the detention
shed and to have authority, over the
watchmen employed there. He will be In
dividually responsible for the safe-keep
ing of Chinese immigrants and will super
vise personally the arrival and exit of the
Immigrants with a view to the preven
tion ot the practice of allowing Chinamen
to land and substituting in their place in
the detention shed some other Chinamen
who wish to return to China at the ex
pense'of the steamship company.
Eight Chinese immigrants made their
escape a few months ago through a win
dow, at the rear of the shed. A week or
two later three more escaped. The shed
Is owned and controlled by the Pacific
Half Steamship Company and is con
strued to be the deck of the vessel or ves
sels on which the immigrants arrive, and
they are held there by the company until
their applications to be landed have been
passed upon by the Collector. t
The Immigrants are watched by em
ployes of the steamship company and by
watchmen paid by the Treasury Depart
ment, but this fact does not render the
Government responsible for the safe
keeping of the Chinese. The United States
statutes impose a penalty of $500 in each
case upon masters of vessels who aid and
abet In the illegal landing of Chinese. A
recent opinion by the Solicitor ' of the
Treasury holds that where negligence is
shown, the master of the vessel (1. e.,
the steamship company) is responsible in
the sum of $500 for each escape, such
negligence being equivalent to "aiding anu
abetting." '
Collector Stratton has been ordered by
the department to ' request the United
States District Attorney to bring suit
against the Pacific Mall Steamship Com
pany to recover the penalty of $5500 for
the eleven Chinamen who were' allowed, to
escape from the shed. tiin â¢
The Collector placed the matter in the
hands of District . Attorney Woodworth
yesterday and the papers in the. suit are
being prepared. .. ':/_Â¦; s ,

MONTEZUMA COPPER STOCKS.
MONTEZUMA COPPER STOCKS.
MONTEZUMA COPPER STOCKS.
MONTEZUMA COPPER STOCKS.
Copper Is the best mining proposition in the
world to-day, for the following reasons:
L The growing demand for copper occasioned
by the advance In electrical construction.
2. The depletion of copper deposits upon
which the trade has hitherto largely depended.
8. . The immense bodies of low-grade ore In -
favored localities enabling companies with large
capital to make their properties dividend-payers
almost from the beginning.
4. Better than gold because "gold Is where
you find It" and, considering the large number
cf gold mines, is rarely found in paying, quan-
tities; huge bodies of copper ore carry uniform
values and don't "peter out." - â¢ ' .
5. Better than oil, because of the numerous
wildcat companies.
WASHINGTON COPPER MINES.
Perhaps the largest copper deposits \n the
world lie In the State of Washington; they were
discovered and development work begun in
some sections only a few years ago; the oldest
of these mines are great producers to-day and
are making fortunes for the holders of the
stock.
THE MONTEZUMA MINING COMPANY.
This newest and at the same time the largest
of copper companies in Washington offers pre-
cisely the same opportunities that thousands of
people tave grasped to their profit. It has
twenty-four fine properties in the famous Car-
bon River and Tahoma districts at the base of
Mount Rainier, fifty-two miles from Tacoma,
one of the most favored mining regions In the
world, by reason of the large bodies of low-
grade ore. Its proximity to rail and water trans-
portation, and the abundance of- timber and
water on the properties themselves. This and
adjacent regions have already produced values
amounting to $100,000,000, and the output has
hardly commenced.
The company is capitalized at $10,000,000, of
which $8,000,000 is treasury stock, non-assess-
able under the laws of Washington.
The four properties of the "Tacoma" group
are destined to become one of the most pro-
ductive mines on the Pacific Coast. These
alone, when developed, will bring the company's
stock to par. The ore Is 6hown In a vein thirty
feet wide, which is traceable on the surface of
the whole width of the company's holdings. The
Tacoma tunnelhas been driven over one hun-
dred feet In solid ore, running over $60 to the
ton. There are fifteen distinct veins of minerals
In the company's properties, and It is not un-
reasonable to expect that as many more will
come to light as the properties are developed.
â THE ASSAYS.
The following is the result of ten assays taken
from samples of ore In the tunnel of the Ta-
coma mine of the Montezuma Company:

HIGH PERCENTAGES OF COPPER.
"The high percentages of copper in these
northern deposits are what will attract the at-
tention of the mining world. It is nothing- un-
usual for them to run from 26 to 75 per cent of
copper. What these high percentages mean will,
be better understood when it is known that the
Calumet and Hecla mine of Michigan is paying
dividends this year (1900) of $40,000,000 from
ore carrying only 4 per cent copper."â San
Francisco Chronicle.
A NEW RAILROAD.
The power plant for an electric railroad Is al-
ready completed, and the laying of the track is
only waiting the development of the ore bodies
to that fifty tons of orÂ« a day can be mined.
This will enable the Montezuma Company to
place Its ore at the Tacoma smelter for $4 25
per ton, and at the sew Fairfax smelter for
one-fourth of that amount. â (See dispatch- in
The Examiner of March 21 for railroad building
to mines.) . -
DIVIDENDS.
All moneys received from the profits of the
Montezuma mines will be paid in dividend!* to
the shareholders. Such funds cannot be rein-
vested In the company. The opening of the
mines and ail expenses incident thereto must
be provided for out of the sale of shares until
returns are obtainable from the properties.
Stockholders will remember that in purchasing
Ehares in this company they at once become In-
terested in all the properties owned by them.
THE VALUE OF GOOD MANAGEMENT.
The success of a mining property depends In
a large measure upon the integrity and knowl-
edge of its management.
C. W. Thompson, president, is also president
of the Washington Co-operative Syndicate (a
dividend payer), was manager of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company's mining interests for
five years In Dakota, Idaho and Washington.

EXAMINATION OF THE PROPERTIES. '
Investors have only to see the properties to
appreciate their worth. With a view to en-
courage subscriptions tc the stock in 'a large
wcy we will give intending investors every op-
portunity to examine the mines where 200,000
or more shares are contemplated on 'a cash
basis. We will be glad to arrange with such
for sharing the expenses of examination.
EXCURSION JUNE 15.
On June 15 we -will run a special train of
Pullman Drawl ng-Room Sleeping Cars from
San Â¦ Francisco to Tacoma and Seattle. Fare,
round trip, $40, or free transportation to the
purchaser of stock. SÂ«i.d for excursion folder.
CO-OPERATION AND CONSOLIDATION.
Co-operation and consolidation are the watch-
words of the business world to-day. The enter-
prises which make money for their owners are
theme which are operated in the largest possible
way and with the greatest economy of manage-
ment. The Montezuma Mining Company has
been organized with thtse great facts of modern
business life fully in view. It owns and controls
twenty-four (24) mining properties, and expects
soon to acquire others. Tnis policy is pursued
because business experience has taught that
only by thus consolidating Interests can be had
the most efficient management, combined with
the lowest operating expenses, and, consequent-
ly, the largest profit. Instead of a dozen or
more feeble, struggling companies, each having"
Us official and technical staff, the Montezuma
operates an entire group of mines with its sin-
gle, highly trained and efllclent management.
Investors will not be alow to perceive that this
policy of consolidation and co-operation means
for them a concentration of values in the stock
of the company. Ei'ery single share really rep-
resents all that is back of many shares In
smaller companies.
DOES IT PAY TO BUY MINING STOCK?
Some people say it Joes not; and some people
sa.y It does.
Those people who know nothing about It say
it does not pay-
. But the people who own 1000 shares of stock
in the Quincy draw nearly $6000 cash yearly
dividends; those people who own 1000 shares in
the Tamarack received last year $17,000 in div-
idends; In the Calumet and Hecla they draw
about $33,000 yearly;' in the Alaska-Tread well
about $1500 yearly; In the Richardson of Nova
Scotia $2500 yearly, and in the Homestake of
South Dakota they draw $6000 yearly on each
1000 shares of stock. The list can be extended
to Include 256 mining companies at least in the
United States alone; to own 1000 shares of stock
In any one of them would insure a good yearly
Income.' .
If you had bought 1000 shares of the "Le
Roy" Gold Mining Company five years ago It
would have cost $50. It is now worth $40,000.

COPPER AKD COAL.
TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF COAL LANDS.
TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF COAL LANDS.
TWO THOXJ8AND ACRES OF COAL LANDS.
TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF COAL LANDS.
The Montezuma Mining Company, In connec-
tion with the Washington Co-operative Syndi-
cate, has leased for twenty years 1800 acres
of the finest coal lands in Washington, . so that
to-day there is no better -proposition in the
State. We have some twelve veins of coal
from four to nine feet in width, with an aver-
age lift of 2000 feet, and four miles in length.
We have approximately some fifty million tons
of coal. We have one vein of coal nine feet
two inches In width that Is pure # coal except
some two inches of bone; the analysis shows it
to be without a superior in the State. I give
you herewith' the analysis: Moisture,' 1.60 per
cent; volatile. 34.25 per cent; fixed carbon, 62.00
per cent; ash, 2.25 per cent .We will have in
this vein over seven million tons of coal above
water level, and nearly as much below. The
other eleven veins, although not as large, would
give us a vast amount of coal. .1 need not say
that the magnitude of our coal proposition Is a
large one; we shall expect before many months !
to be shipping a large amount of coal per day.
A part of our veins an? fine coking coal. As a
portion of our coal makes the best of coke, and
as each oven will earn about' $5 per day in
making coke, and with an unlimited demand,
this part of our business win be exceedingly
profitable. Our coal property is a little over
one mile from the railroad at Fairfax, where
we are opening up our coal. We have about
600 feet elevation, and' shall have our bunkers
at the railroad and run our coal to the bunkers
in a flume, having plenty of water for this pur-
pose and also to run all of our machinery, so
that all the handling of our coal will be done
automatically, which means cheaply.
We have with both of our companies money
enough on hand to put our coal property in
shipping order. So that we expect to be
shipping coal in May, and shall, I believe, be
able to commence paying dividends in August,
1901.â Letter from C. W. Thompson, President
DIVIDENDS THIS YEAR.
Our coal mines alone will pay" big dividends
to all shareholders when same are run at full
capacity (about thirty men being at present |
employed, the force to be increased as rapidly
as development will permit), and as soon as we I
begin- turning out "copper matte" from the
smelter these dividends will be very materially
increased. The net proceeds of each mine are
paid in dividnds to the share holders;. not one
dollar of such funds can be used for develop-
ment work.
STOCK ADVANCING.
The price of the btock of the Montezuma
Mining Company is advancing every month,
and is liable any month to make some big
Jumps. These expectations axe based upon the
following facts:
Firstâ Because the company has a large cap-
italization, which is nearly all treasury stock.
It has been the experience of the past that all
mining companies having a large amount of
treasury stock have Deen able to successfully
develop their properties, because by the sale of
such stock they have obtained sufficient work-
ing capital for all the purposes of securing and
developing their propeities, while companies
with a small amount- of such stock have failed
from a lack of sufficient working capital. *
The capitalization and organization plans of
the "Montezuma" are such that with honest
management failure la absolutely an Impossi-
bility, and the company must necessarily be-
come a great controlling power of the vast
mineral products of the Pacific Coast.
.. THE POOR MAN'S CHANCE..
' The man or woman earning wages investing
$5, $10, $15 or more per month for the next few
months in this stock may, and most likely will
in the near future receive in dividends every
month a greater income than their present
earnings.
People who make monthly deposits in banks
may reasonably expect much larger returns by
putting the same into the purchase of the stock
of this company; and those with a good bank
account will, without doubt, find It the best
investment on the market at the present time.
There has been no time in the past when the
banker and the public generally could Invest
money as safely in purchasing the stock of a
company, based upon a large capitalization,
with valuable mineral properties and doing a
legitimate mining business, with such absolute
assurance of large returns as at the present
time. . :â¢
The risks are so small and the prospects so
large that it seems to us that no one with the
slightest ambition to improve his financial con-
dition need have any Hesitation in purchasing
this* stock while he can do so at the present low
price. In a short time the price of the stock
will so advance that none but the rich can pur-
chase it, when the best opportunity of a life-
time .will be lost to you.
WHY A SAFE INVESTMENT.
' Because the company owns (or controls by
long lease) 1000 acres of rich copper properties
and 1&00 acres of the best steam and coking
coal in the State of Washington.
Because there is a constantly increasing de-
mand for' copper, the price for same being
more than double what it was a few years ago.
Because first-class steaming- and blacksmith-
ing coal and coke are in such demand on the
Paciflo Coast that the company could not sup-
ply one-half of the present requirement of the
market If they were producing at full capacity.
Because the "Montezuma'.' employs only the
most skilled mining engineers to be found on
the continent, hesitating at no reasonable ex-
pense to determine the absolute value of their
mines. v
Because the Montezuma Mining Company is
organized under the laws of the State of Wash-
ington, where protection is afforded the Investor
against fraud and misrepresentation.
Because Its Managers and Directors are men
well known for their high moral character and
business abilityâ particularly skilled In mining
and financiering.
Because the company incurs No Debts, thus
running no risk of a financial crash or panic in
the commercial world. Do you realize the Im-
portance of this? The people of this country
are slowly recovering from a great financial de-
pression; a few years of prosperity are before
us, and then will surely come the regular
period of distress, but it will affect only such
institutions as are struggling under a heavy
load of debt. .
The Montezuma Company has No Bonded In-
debtedness. Its stock i& Non-Assessable. Its
management is unsurpassed. Its products can
be easily and cheaply marketed. Nowhere In
the world can copper \ and coal be produced
more cheaply.
J. D. Mclntyre, consulting engineer for the
"Montezuma," says ta his late report on the
Coal property: "The total or approximate esti-
mate of coal within the boundaries of your
coal lands is 21,621,600 tons." which would give
an output of 1000 Tons Daily for a Period of 75
Years; 300 days to the year. Â¦ . .
A BIG, SAFE COMPANY.
Large capitalization insures the complete de-
velopment of all the properties now under con-
trol or that may hereafter J>e acquired by the
company. A development fund -Is created by
the sale of shares, and from no other source.
The tendency of the world of action now Is in
all directions toward combination of capital and
ability In great enterprises*. The time has gone
by when the individual alone, single-hnndod.
can 'make a great success. So It Is In mining
enterprises. The companies of large capitaliza-
tion, commanding, as they do; large resources,
are the successful ones. Such companies "pro-
tect their stockholders in all of their rights and
Interests, and return to them large dividends.
The losses people meet with In such Investments
are always In the small companies, for the
simple reason that their capital is too small to
successfully carry out their undertakings.
FUTURE PROSPECTS.
Every man and woman has a desire to Im-
prove his or her financial prospects.
Even' man and woman who had the gift of
tin Independent Judgment, and the courage, re-
gardless of the possibilities then existing that
every dollar he investe.l might be lost, to pur-
chase 1000 shares or mure of the stock in the
following companies and held on to It, are. now
classed among the wealthy people of the coun-
try. .
The purchaser of 1000 shares of stock in the
following companies, when It- was first offered
to the public at a merely nominal price, would
now have the followins valuations:
In the. Calumet and Hecla ...$760,000
In the Boston and Montana.... 327,000
In the Tamarack ; 194,000
In the Quincy 137.000
In the Anaconda 26,250
In the Isabella 112,000
In the Raven 68,500
In the Osceola 70,000
In the Standard 315,000
In the Butte and Boston 84,000
The above list represents only a few of the
large number of mining companies that have
made enormous fortunes for their stockholders;
PRICE OF 'MONTEZUMA : STOCK?
The par value of Montezuma stock Is $1 per
share. For a short time it is offered at 10c
cash or 12c on monthly installments. ' i-1 . v
These prices are far below the real value, but
the company wishes to carry out its co-operat-
ive idea, making Its shares acceptable to a
wide range of customers. This stock has In-
creased in value 100 per oent since we began
its eale a short time ago, and will make a like
advance within the next few months. A block
of this stock of moderate size will in a few
years provide a competency for the owner. Â¦
Remember, the holder of this stock will share
In the profits of both the. copper and the coal
mines.
Send in your subscription by return mall. Act
independently, i act promptly, thus securing the
best possible advantages, for another advance
In price of shares will soon take place.

Associated Banks' Statement.
To Start Settlement Paper.
- BERKELEY. April 6.â The college eet
tlement in West Berkeley has been pre
sented with a complete printing outfit by
Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst. The boys will
start a paper to be devoted to the inter
ests of the settlement. J. A. Olmstead.
a student of the university, will have
charge He will be assisted by Edward
Hadlen and Frank Speegen.
Auditor Wells yesterday returned with
out his approval three demands for over
time sent to him by the Board of Public
Works. The demands were drawn in fa
vor of George Keelpy for $5 63. M. Kava
naugh $7 13 and Ed Sweeney $7 S7, and rep
resents pay for extra sewer work. Wells
says that his attorneys advise -him that
the charter does not allow pay for over
time to city employes. He says the men
are caid for work on Sundays and holi
davs arid the charter says this shall be
in full compensation for their services.
No Pay for Overtime.
The Financier says: The changes in the
If sidinpr Items of the Associated- Banks of New
York for the week ending April 6 are heavier
than for a month or more past. The current
statement covers a full week, although for
two days of this period the stock and ' com
mercial exchanges were closed. The exittbit
reveals a further decrease of $2,052,525 In ex
cess reserve, bringing the total surplus above
requirements to $5,S17,915, the lowest figure
touched since December 8 last. . The contrac
tion was due mainly to a loss of $8,678,000 in
specie and legals, and the latter. In turn, re
flects in full the operations of the bank with
the treasury and the interior. It should be
understood â¢ that the " drain on the banks by
reason of gold exports, etc., counts to the
full amount In the statement, while on the
other hand receipts probably . show only aver
ages. The "week, 1 however, was characterized
by several ' temporary transactions that cut
Into the banks' totals. The gold exports have
already been mentioned. In addition a.gTeat
deal of currency has been flowing out of New
York in payment of sales of gilt-edged secu
rities in this market, and the treasury has
also profited by reason of unusual sales of
stamps and payment of taxes, etc., at- this
center. The banks, therefore, have been put
to an unusual drain, but the reduction of the
lean Item JX2.449.3OO, with the fall In deposits
cf $18,501,900. offset nearly two-thirds of the
cash loss. With reference to the changes In
the leading items it is to be noted that sev
eral large banks are responsible for the
heaviest decreases. . These. Institutions repre
sent the syndicates which have figured in deals
of various kinds for some time past, and it
Is to causes incident thereto that the bulk of
the week's changes can be attributed. As to
the 1 general . effect of the ' statement on tho
current money market it Is idle to speak at

. -visors That It Works Hardship
on Their Business.
Attorney Thomas F. Prendergast filed a
petition yesterday with the Board of Su
pervisors signed by a number of Â¦whole
sale butchers, asking for the modification
of the present pound ordinance in order
that their business may not be harassed
by the officers of the pound acting in pur
suance cf the regulations. The petition is
signed by Biggs & McCormlck, William
Taafe & Co.. II. Levy, B. Salles & Co.,
Clayburgh & George, J. G. Johnson,
Charles Rosenberg and Miller & Lux.
They represent that the pound ordinance"
works a hardship and is In restraint of
the trade of wholesale sheep butchers in
South San Francisco* or the district set
apart for the preparation of meat for the
people of the city.
That the ordinance is unreasonable and
injurious to the interests of the petition
ers was made evident, they say, in tha
recent summary impounding of a flock of
sheep near Hunters Point. That a repe
tition of such proceedings may not hap
pen, the petitioners ask that the pound, or
dinance be modified by eliminating there
from the provisions which forbid grazing
or herdine animals on unfenced lots, so
that the ordinance may not apply to the
southern suburbs.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
Master of Transportation Richardson
said last evening that the coast division
trains at present consisted of seven cars.
The cafe cars had been built especially for
the coast division service and they
would be replaced by dining cars if the
immense traffic continued. He .said the
trains could not make the time they do
at present if they consisted of more than
seven coaches. . â¢.;.%. ;,â¢; :
A number of the patrons of the road
claim that they will bring the matter to
the attention of President Hays unless
there is a change for the better. They
say that more coaches are needed and
that a dining car service should be Insti
tuted at once. â¢
Numerous complaints are being voiced
by patrons of the* Southern Pacific Com
pany who travel over the new coast di
vision line. They claim that a number
of changes should be made at once for
the comfort of the many hundreds jour
neying on the road at this season of the
The chief grievance is the poor dining
car service that is at present in vogue.
The trains that leave here and Los Ange
les carry what Is known as a cafe car.
This car has accommodations permitting
fifteen people to partake of meals at one
time. The train that arrived here late
Friday evening from Los Angeles car
ried more than 400 passengers. During
the trio up those who wanted to partake
of a meal on the train had to stand in
line and wait their turn. As an actual
fact the line at the lunch hour was of
such a length that those who were at the
end of It did not get their meal until 4:30
p m which Is pretty nearly dinner time.
On this trip two women fainted from ex
haustion while waiting Â¦ their turn to get
a meal.
The passenger car service on the coast
division Is also very bad. When the
trains lesfve xvos Angeles at this season of
the year they are crowded with tourists,
who are on their way to San Francisco.
Numerous stops are made along the road
and by the time a train arrives at Mon
terey the cars are crowded to Inconven
ience. There are always at this point many
passengers on their way to this city and
the conseuqence is that a number of them
have to either stand in the aisles or sit
on the arms of the chairs until they cr
rive here.

CHICAGO, April â¢ 6.â May. corn opened wild;
with bids ranging from- 44c to 44%c, the high
est price of the crop for delivery, next month.
These prices were % to, l%c higher than ,the
close the previous session and marked a com^
plete recovery from the demoralizing break of
the first, two,, sessions of the week. Â¦ ' Phillips^
the bull leader, who" Is"' credited with -having
control of the market, bought moderately; fjr
customers and declared that he ' sold nothing.
The demand. was broad and heavy for "country
interests, . and' at times frantic- from local
shorts. The aggregate amount 1 , of: the day's
transactions was undoubtedly enormous. . For
a few minutes at the- opening offerings were
light, but they became freer soon. Longs
profiting by recent experience, realized that the
market still has two sides and took profits.
There was, however, no indication of any bear
movement, but, on the contrary, some of the
shorts- who covered were those who "had led
in the raid Monday and Wednesday. The mar
ket yielded with the greatest stubbornness.
Shortly before noon â¢ May touched 44c. From
this It reacted to 44i,4'5'44Uc and closed %c
higher at 44Hc. The strong opening was due
to -wet weather West and to light offerings.
The reaction was influenced to a moderate de
gree by the pronounced weakness of wheat.
But sentiment, which apparently had returned
to Its previous bullishness In the majority of
cases, was -mainly responsible for the tone of
the market. : The pit was Jammed full, and
despite the activity of wheat and oats, the
coarse cereal j held the Â¦ speculative leadership
of the floor. for 'two days were 515
cars, 107 of contract erade.
The wheat' market was a striking contrast
to corn. It was easy at the opening, weaker
as trading progressed and weaker at the close.
May opened unchanged to %c lower at 72*40 tc
72c for one brief moment, supported by the
corn strength." There were no cables and the
array of news offered anything . but cheer to
the holders. Argentine shipments were 1,696,000
bushels and Snow's crop report averred that In
twenty years the spring growth had never been
better at this season. "The- new century
opened," said this report, "with-wheat in un
excelled condition and an acreage the largest
on record." Added to these was the expecta
tion of bearish statistics Monday. The light
ness 6f Australian shipments and reports of
a ' sharp cash t Inquiry and' heavy flour sales
did little to check the decline. Beam ham
mered the market down to 71c during the first
two hours. At this point stop-loss orders were
reached and, a further slump to 70%@70%c fol
lowed. The close was weak. l*c lower at 70%c.
Seaboard clearances in wheat and flour were
equal -to 676,000 bushels, while .primary receipts
were 822,000 bushels, compared with" 559,000
bushels last year. Minneapolis and Duluth re
ported 498 cars, against 369 last week and 463
Oats were comparatively quiet. There was
a heavy commission house demand as well as
covering by shorts, while local longs did most
of the selling. The reaction following the open
ing was in sympathy with wheat and cqm.
May sold between 26^c and 26%c and closed
a shade higher at 25%@25%c.
. Provisions. . especially pork, were easier on
liquidation by longs.' although there was noth
ing of a particularly bearish character appar

LONDON. Ar>rU G.â Th* tone of money was
easier to-day. The release of Government divi
dends partially relieved the short loan pressure
and. documents were: steady. Business was
quieter than usual on a Saturday since the
quarter-turn and money was more strincent.
The expected keenness ha3 been intensified since
April 1 by the Bank' of. England declining to
lend on shorter periods than a week, inslstln*
on i\t. per cent. About two-thirds of the in
debtedness, amounting to several millions, had
to be renewed April 2. only to be liquidated
with the relea.se of home and Indian Govern
ment dividends, thoush easier rates were an
ticipated. Payments for the final Installment of
Â£3.450,000 exchequer bonds of the Issue of April
12 will aeain send borrowers to the Bank of
England, especially next week, being the set
tlement, nor can marked . relief be expect*!
from ' Government | disbursements â¢ pendln* the
budget. The opportunity is open for many
clearances of protectively dutiable Eoods Im
mediately and thereafter revenue collections
will shrink. The coming loan will soon absorb
the excess of disbursements -over income and
the market doubtless will have to rely on the
bank for a very larire sum. With loan ca!Is
of seven millions ' monthlv spread over eight
months a continued disturbance of the monÂ»y
market must ensue; involving rank control.
It wi!] possibly be found, however, that the
maintenance of rates .will attrect foreign
money, the prospects of which are increased.
If a loan . Is offered at a price favorable to
French and American investment â 93V4 or 95
are now mentionpdâ it is taken for granted that
it. will be applied for many times over, espe
cially if the war in 3ou?*i Africa is real'y
ended, thus Imparting confidence. This will
be the last opportunity to buy Government
stock cheap. â¢
The reduction in the bank's supply of bul
lion this week was due to the large sums sent
to the provinces. The report that another half
million has been shipped from India is un
founded. The" half-million now in transit Is
expected next week.

Treasury does not point to an early renewal
of. purchases in London on account of the In
dian Government. Apparently the amount held
