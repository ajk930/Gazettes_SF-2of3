The Swallow and her tow were off Long
Point late Friday night, when the gale
was at its height. The wind was square
abeam and the steamer shipped great
quantities of water from every wave that
struck her. At 2 o'clock Saturday morn
ing the water was three feet* deep in the
engine room and her fires wer^ put out.
Captain Quinlan decided to abandon the
vessel. Signals of distress were given and
the towllne cut. The crew lowered the
yawl and put off. The Swallow lurched
and her deckload of lumber came tumbling
down about the yawl, but not enough of
the timber struck the craft to swamp it,
and the men reached the Manitou after a
fierce battle with the waves.
BUFFFALO, N. Y., Oct. 20.â The vessel
that foundered in Saturday morning's gale
off Long Point was the steamer Swallow,
lumber-laden, bound from Emerson, Lake
Superior, to Buffalo. The crew of ten
men were taken off the steamer by -her
consort, the wooden barge Manitou, with
great difficulty. The Northern Pacific
barge Walter Scranton picked up the
Manitou Saturday evening and towed her
into port to-night.

FOUNDERS IN A STORM
All the powder marks are on the side
of the head toward the door through
which Mrp. Mayer entered and saw the
suicide of her daughter's slayer, the bed
separating her from the murderer.
The father of the dead girl has been in
Alaska, engaged in mining for some time,
and is now on his way home. The family
were looking forward with great expec
tancy to a happy reunion. Of the mur
derer but little is known. He is said to
be a native of Smyrna, about 23 years of
age. John Bahan, a relative of the fam
ily,' said they were continually annoyed
by his persistent following of Mabel and
had done all they could to keep him
away, but he persisted in visiting at the
house.
Although the bedclothing was disar
ranged, there was no appearance of a
struggle. Stano had evidently placed the
pistol, a cheap v.capon of 32 caliber, to
the head of the child and fired the three
shots. Mabel was evidently sleeping
when the deed was committed.
The attempt of Mrs. Mayer to enter
the room apparently caused Stano to
shift his position and to walk around the
foot of the bed, opposite to the side from
which ho had fired the shots.
" 'I've killed Mabel and I am going to
kill myself.' he said. He put the pistol
at once to his head and the fourth shot
was fired. He dropped in a heap between
Mabel's clothes closet and the bed, and I
ran out to give the alarm."
"It was three short, sharp sounds." she
told Deputy Coroner McCormlck, "and I
thought some boards had fallen. I went
to Mabel's door, found it locked, and then
I went around the side of the house to
the kitchen so as to get into her room.
"Stano was standing by the Bide of the
bed. Mabel was lying as if asleep, but
there were blood stains on the piilow on
which her head rested, and blood flowing
from her temple. Stano was standing at
the opposite side of the bed with a pistol
in his hand.
In a rear room in hir mother's home
at 50S^ Jessie street, 13-year-old Mabel
Franklin Mayer was shot three times In
the head, at an early hour this morn
ing, dying ' instantly, and John Stano,
the murderer, put a bullet through his
brain, dropping doad by the side of the
bed in which his victim lay. He shot
himself just as Mrs. Mayer, mother of
the murdered girl, entered the room, say
ing as he turned the pistol on himself,
"I have killed Mabel and I am going to
kill myself."
Stano, the murderer and suicide, has
known the girl for about two years and
has been insanely Jealous of her. He
has been employed off and on as a waiter
in restaurants on Sixth street, in the vi
cinity of his victim's residence, and also
as quartermaster on the transport Meade.
The murdered girl attended the Clement
Grammar School and was considered a
bright pupil. For the last two years
Stano has been paying her attention.
He was a constant visitor at the house.
He was admitted last night about the
usual hour, but the young girl had re
tired. He went directly to her room,
which is in the rear part of the house
and connected with the kitchen. The
mother and some friejpds were in the front
of the. house.' Mrs. "Mayer was awaltlnj; 1
the arrival of some members of the fam
ily when 6he heard a peculiar sound in
the rear room.
Dr. Palmer at once dressed the wounds
cf the Injured cook and made him as com
fortable as possible. The physician found
twelve incised wounds of the scalp, all
exposing the bone, but he could not state
whether the ckull had been fractured.
The police were Immediately notified,
but as yet have secured no clew as to the
identity of the highbinder or the motive
for the crime. They believe the deed to
have been an aftermath of the recent
Chinatown war.
At this juncture Dr. Palmer and the
members of his family rushed to the rear
of the house. They had heard the cries
for help. When the highbinder became
aware of their presence he paused in his
brutal work and prepared for escape.
Turning: from his position over his bleed
ing victim he started back for the stair
way. The woman, who had already dis
played such braveryt followed and suc
ceeded in catching hold of his blouse. She
was dragged into the street and there
forced to release her hold and watch the
Chinese dash away.
As the two Chinese came out of the pan
try the servant, Agnes, attracted by the
chase, came Into the hallway. Darkness
prevented her from getting a good view
of the trag-edy that was being committed,
but she knew that murder was being done
from the agonizing cries of the cook and
the thud of the hatchet blows. Without
hesitation she ran upon the struggling
pair. The highbinder continued his ruth
less work, heedless of her presence. The
woman seized his arm and tried to
wrest the weapon from him. She was
thrust back and the hatchet blows fell as
before.
With a cry of terror the cook sprang
back and out of the room. The high
binder was after him and with upraised
hatchet followed him up the stairway
leading to the first floor. Along a dark
hallway the pair ran, the hatchet wiolder
making several passes with his weapon
as he rushed along. Where the hallway
comes to an end Tsoy saw all means of
escape cut off. As a last resort he
cafhed into a pantry and attempted to
close the door. The highbinder, with
superior strength, prevented this and
Tsoy sprang outside again. Then the
would be murderer commenced his bloody
â¢work, chopping the marked man's head
until he brought him almost Insensible
to the floor.
The cook saw the figure of another Chi
nese crouching in the corner. He realized
what it meant m an instant. A price was
en his head, and the man he had sur
prised In the butler's room was there to
claim it.
The home of Dr. George H. Palmer at
the corner of Jackson and Steiner streets
vas the scene last niffht of one of the
boldest highbinder crimes ever perpetrat
ed In this city. A Chinese cook employed
by the family was attacked in the house
by a hatchetman and his head so horri
bly chopped that death may result. The
deed was committed in the presence of
one of the women servants. Notwith
standing her presence the hired murderer
did not cease his dastardly assault until
his victim fell, with twelve gaping wounds
In his scalp, and the entire family had been
aroused and had rushed to scene. The
woman servant, whose name is Agnes,
tried to disarm the highbinder, and, cling
ing to his blouse, was dragged into the
etreet. There she was obliged to relin
quish her hold and the assassin, with the
bloody hatchet still in his hand, ran down
Steiner street and disappeared.
The victim of the attack has been em
ployed in the physician's home for nearly
seven years. His name is Tsoy Sin. He
5s steady in his habits and seldom visits
Chinatown, as is customary among Mon
golian servants working in households. H s
disposition to remain in his quarters at
nlg-ht was probably known to the tong
that designed the destruction of his life.
On thif account the old-time "custom of
watching an opportunity to commit mur
der in the streets was abandoned for the
bold plot put into execution last night.
Tscy finished his work in the kitchen
shortly after 7 o'clock -in the evening. He
started down into the basement and,
passing the butler's room, observed that
a light was burning in It. Calling the
butler's name be received no reply. Then
he pushed the door open and stepped into
the apartment.

from 1795 to 1817. Then was sung the dox
ology, and the benediction was pro
nounced by Rev. Timothy Dwight, presi
dent of the university from 1S66 to 1S95.
Services in Many Churches.
Meanwhile, special bicentennial services
were held in other churches of the city
and special sermons were preached by
Rev. Newman Smyth, in the Center
Church: Rev. Joseph Anderson of Water
bury, in the United Church, and Rev.
Walter Wesley Battershall of Albany, In

are located on the historic green, adja

This afternoon, at 3 o'clock. Rev. George
Park Fisher, president of ecclesiastical
history and dean of the Yale Divinity
School, delivered an address on "Yale
university In Its Relations to Theology
and Missions." He said in part:
â¢â¢As to the theology within the precincts
of the university in the last four or five
decades, the period is too recent to be re
viewed at length on the present occasion.
It was a period, in all enlightened coun
tries, of concentration of thought and in
quiry upon the historical foundations of
Christianity, including the life, the per
son and the work of Christ. It has intro
duced a new epoch in Biblical criticism,
which compels a reconsideration of the
crucial question of the seat of authority,
with particular reference to the inspira
tion and authority of the Bible. More
over the state of "philosophy and new
teachings and theories of natural science
have called for a reconstruction of the
foundations of theism. They have neces
sitated a new fortifying of the citadel of
all religious faith.
Yale's Higher Criticism.
â¢'It may be said with propriety that
Ya.*-- has been neither indifferent nor si
lent" on these cardinal questions of world
wide Interest. It is proper to mention that
in the field of apologetics the' effort here
has been to deal with the new problems
in a spirit of candor, with mingled fear
lessness and discretion. As to the ques
tions grouped under the head of the
higher criticism, whatever may be judged
of the wisdom or want of wisdom in the
Yale teaching, this at least can be af
firmed that there has been no evasion of
them and little inclination on the part
of Yale Instructors, ostrich-like, to hide
their heads in the sand, and, on the
whole, I venture to say the usual en
deavor has been, as in all prervious pe
riods of our academic history, to unite a
genuine liberality with a wise and ten
able conservatism." '
To-night the hotels and boarding houses
are rapidly filling, and new arrivals are
constant. The weather Is superb, and all
day the streets of the city have been filled
by sightseers. To-morrow will be de
voted principally to ceremonies of official
welcome.

General Lacuna, who surrendered last May. has complained to General
Chaffee that the terms upon which he and his force surrendered have not
been respected by the Americans. He exhibits a document signed by himself
and-General Frederick Funston in which he and his force are granted im
munity in respect to all acts committed contrary to the laws of war. Since
the document several of Lacuna's officers and men have been tried, con
demned and sentenced to death for killing American prisoners. General Fun
ston says that when it was signed he gave Lacuna orally to understand that
the killing of American prisoners was excepted. Lacuna admits that some
thing was" said on the subject, but says no thorough understanding was
reached, and he considers the written agreement binding.
FEARS GENERAL RENEWAL OF INSXTRRECTION.
â¢WASHINGTON, Oct. 20.â More troops will be sent to the Island of
Samar if the condition -does, not improve, and the forces in the Philippines
will be greatly strengthened. It is "estimated that there are at this time only
30oo,troopsirr Samar, These consist of- what the 'natives in the recent en
gagement have left of .the Ninth Infantry, the First Infantry, four com
panies of the Seventh Infantry, one battalion of the Sixth Infantry and 150
nati/e "scouts. A detachment of the Sixth Infantry has just been sent.
General Hughes, in the opinion of the War Department, has not appre
ciated the serious character of the opposition in Samar or has failed to get
the men he needed to cone with the-insurrection. General Hughes has gone
to Cebu to recuperate and General Smith is acting in his stead.
If is feared here that if quick steps are not taken to stamp out the Samar
revolt it will spread rapidly to the other islands that have only recently
been pacified after years of fighting. The policy of the department is under
stood to be to rush troops to Samar from the other islands, and, if they can
not well be spared from their present posts to fill their places with drafts
from the United States. The impression is growing that this is a time for
very vigorous measures if what has been gained in some islands is not to be
lost.
NATIVES ABE MANUFACTURING BOLOS.
nANILA, Oct. 20.â Owinjr to the vigilance of Lieutenant Thomas M.
Baines Jr. of the Ninth United States Infantry another slaughter of
American troops by the insurgents has been averted Lieutenant
Baines discovered a prisoner re-entering a cell at Carbiga. Island of
Samar, where several were confined, through a hole that had been made in the
wall. An investigation showed a plan to. fill the jail with bolomen and to call
the guard, which would be necessary to get the door open, and then to attack
the garrison. It also developed that the instigators were a priest and the
presidents both of whom have been arrested, together with several other
prominent persons.
Other attempts have been discovered, but fortunately frustrated, at Pam
bujan and other points in Samar. Several persons .have been arrested in
connection with these.
Reinforcements are beine. rushed to Samar. Three hundred and thirty
marines, under Lieutenant Colonel Mancil C. GoodrelK have gone there
aboard the cruiser New York and two battalions of the Twelfth Infantry will
start immediateFy for the same destination.
Officers from other provinces that were supposed to be pacified have re
cently arrived in Manila and they say that the news of the American disas
ters spread like wild fire among the natives, who scarcely attempt to conceal
their delight.

In an interview President Gould gave it
as his opinion that what Is most urgently

out the arid States of the West, is the es
tablishment In the canyons and on high
grounds of a series of immense reservoirs
for storing water to be used in reclaiming
great areas in the valleys and deserts.-
This, he said, would solve the question of
irrigation, and to accomplish this end, all
the arid States should work together.

GOULD GIVES HIS VIEWS
ON" RECLAIMING ARID LA1TD
One of the anomalies of the campaign
Is the circumstance that George H. Clark
has won, the indorsement not only of the
Pastors' Union, made up of the clergymen
of the city, but also the indorsement of
the Retail Liquor Dealers' Association,
comprising the saloon-keepers of the
town. The ministers have indorsed Clark
because they say he has, as Mayor,
stopped gambling, - while -the liquor deal
ers bave indorsed him because he has al
lowed their nickel-in-the-slot machines to
â¢run, without hindrance.. Incidentally the
clergymen are "catching it" from many
of the parishioners, who say that the good
men have been passed a "plated brick"
and that they should keep their hands out
of the political pot, anyhow.
Clark has established a paper of his
own called the Independent, and it fairly
bristles with the pointed sarcasm of its
reputed editor in chief, Hiram W. John
son, who, with his brother, Albert M.
Johnson, conducted Clark's side of the fa
mous oil-land suit against Colonel J. B.
"Wright and others. While the" Johnson
brothers are speaking nightly for Clark
at the tent meetings, their father, Grove
L. Johnson, is as forcibly declaiming for
Land, and protesting- that even if the sons
are on the money side the parent is not.
The current sensation is the open charge
made by Edward Bruner that the proprie
tors of the' Signal, -organ of the Council
of Federated Trades, have attempted to
blackmail William Land out of $450. Bru
ner publicly denounces the Signal men as
scoundrels, and says he Is \u25a0 prepared to
prove his charge. He declares that the
Signal held its forms back from Saturday
to 'Monday in order to permit its publish
ers to extort $450 from the Republican
candidate and, 'failing in this, the paper
came out with a scathing arraignment of
Land and has continued its abuse of that
nominee.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 2O.-The Mayor
alty campaign â¢ grows warmer aa it pro
gresses. While there are no less than four
candidates in the field the actual fighting
has narrowed down to the forces, of Wil
.liam Land, the Republican nominee, and
George H. Clark, Independent. Rival
; meetings are held on the same nights, and
vocalists, musicians, jugglers and other
entertainers are enlisted to supplement
the allurements of spellbinders in holding
the crowds. Clark goes about town with
a tent, .which \u25a0 he pitches on vacant lots,
and a band . : riding about in a tallyho
drums' up the expectant multitude.
Land, on the. other hand, affects fire
works and resounding anvils in the open
air, and both plans of campaign appear
to have caught popular favor. Meanwhile
James H. Devine, the Democratic candi
date, is making capital out of the contrast
presented by the standing alone on his
public record and declining to violate the
purity of election law by permitting ex
cessive expenditures in his interest: Gen
eral Tozer, tne Municipal League candi
date, deserted by the very men who were
foremost in forming the reform organiza
tion, is pluckily making his . fight, al
though with small chance of success.
KESWICK, Oct. 20.-A wildcat sprang
at Emll Holden's throat yesterday as he
and Dr F. W. Archer were hunting on
Clear Creek beyond Igo, and made a des
perate fight. While walking over the hilla
the hunters discovered the cat "ouched
on the branch of a tree. Th^y flred five
shots at it with a revolver. Some of tho
bullets took effect and the animal sprang
from the tree upon Holden's back.
Archer rushed to Holden's assistance, as
the animal was clawing him. He was
afraid to flre again for fear of injuring
Holden, and seizing the beast by the
throat the doctor held it tightly until he
had choked Â»t to death.

BODY OF SEKTATOH DAVIS
TO BEST IN" WASHINGTON
People of Minnesota Deplore Widow's
Decision to Remove It From
That State.
ST. PAUL. Oct. 2O.-Mrs. C. K. Davis
left to-night for Washington, where she
will hereafter, make her home. Previous
to her departure she had the body of her
late husband disinterred and will take It
to Washington for burial in the national
cemetery. The fact that the distinguished
Senator's body was to be removed from
the State which had honored him In life
was not known until to-day, and has
caused considerable comment. It had
been proposed to erect a mausoleum in
one of the city parks, wherein the body

TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 20.â To-day's Ori
ental advices state that Governors, Judges
and high military officers are included
among the eighty high officials who have
been ordered beheaded or banished by a
Chinese imperial edict for participating in
the Boxer massacres of last year. \u25a0
This edict deals exclusively with man
darins of all classes connected with the
Boxers. It recites that fifty-six man
darins have already suffered the extreme
penalty of the law for their misdeeds. The
Emperor's brother has now presented the
fresh list of mandarins deserving punish
ment. The edict directs that every per
son named on the list shall be punished,
many being sentenced to death and others
to life-long banishment beyond the fron
tiers of China. The list is a startling
one from the Chinese standpoint, but the
Shanghai papers say it fails as usual to
include the most prominent culprits. In
consequence of earnest efforts by Sir Er
nest baiow, i^riusn iuimsur at reKiug,
not less than thirty-five are ordered pun
ished for complicity in the Chuchou mas
sacre of last year. Governor Liushutang'
of Cheking has been degraded and ban
ished to his native place. Yung Chua>\
Provincial Judge and Treasurer, is de
graded and banished to Szeehuan. Gov
ernor Pao Tsulin of Chuchou is degraded
and sent in perpetual banishment in
Kashgaria. Yu, brigadier general of Chu
chou, was sentenced to perpetual banish
ment, but evaded the sentence by dying.
Ohouchite. commander of local troops at
Chuchou when .he massacre occurred,
\u25a0was executed there, and numerous other
local officials were degraded. Fourteen
of the actual murderers were executed
and nine accomplices were banished.
Scores of pirates and robbers are being
captured at Canton through informers and
executed. One informer, by whose evi
dence many pirates were beheaded, met a
terrible fate.. He was captured by a band
of pirates and cut to pieces alive.
Without regard to the proposed restric
tions in the purchase of arms and ammu
nition by China that country has repur
chased 730,00(1 rounds of Mauser ammuni
tion from a German firm at Tientsin. This
comprised a lot of ammunition captured
in August of last year by the allies in the
native city of Teintsin. Subsequently the
ammunition and other munitions of war
were sold at auction. Li Hung Chang
found that he could buy the supplies
cheaper than to manufacture . them in
\u25a0China's new arsenals and consequentlv
invested. They" will be divided amonk

Thomas J. Lowe, the father of. the young
man mentioned in the .. above dispatch,
says his son is a bricklayer 'by occupa-.

ployed about the City Hall. > He knows of
no reason for. any kidnaping and -shares
the opinion"of "the Sheriff's that it was the
result of thoughtlessness.. â¢ . \u25a0'â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0
"A few minutes after the 5 o'clock
train' left with excursionists this after
noon Mrs. Sloper came to my office and
told me her child nad been kidnaped by
a man at the station. I immediately
telephoned to Tiburon and Santa Rosa
asking the officers of. those points to
locate thebaby. As faras I know there
was no reason why ' the child should be
taken, and I imagine it was done in, a
spirit of fun or thoughtlessness." . .
Sheriff Grace said to-night: "I re
ceived a telephone message from Sheriff
Smith of Mendocino informing me that
a child had been kidnaped and was on the
down train. I boarded the train at Cotati
and found Lowe and the child in one of
the cars. The man protested that he had
intended nothing criminal and said that
some person he didn't know handed the
infant to him. Apparently he had not
been drinking: and his \u25a0explanations were
so unsatisfactory that I took him to the
jail.

County said:
Sheriff Grace of Sonoma County boarded
the car at Cotati and found the boy with
Lowe, who was taken from the train and
locked up to await an investigation.
SANTA ROSA, Oct. 20.â The holiday of
the excursionists who traveled from San
Francisco to Ukiah this morning was en
livened by what appeared to be an at
tempt at the kidnaping of the child of a
tailor in the Mendocino town. A frantic
mother's appeals and the activity of the
Sheriffs of Mendocino and Sonoma coun
ties quickly resulted in the return of the
youngster, besides causing: . the arrest at
Cotati of the alleged kidnaper. His name
is William H. Lowe, and he lives at 214
Golden Gate avenue, San Francisco.
The child, Harold Sloper, 3 years of
age, was at the station in Ukiah when
the train started for Tiburon. Lowe is
alleged to huve invited the boy into one
of the cars and permitted him to remain
until it was too late to leave the depart
ing train.
Mrs. Sloper was at the station and im
mediately noted that her child had dis
appeared. She felt confident that some
person on the train had taken him and
hurried to the Sheriff's office. That offi
cial telephoned descriptions to Tiburon
and Santa Rosa, and Mrs. Sloper started
scuth on the next train. ' .

The Real Cause of Dandruff and
Baldness.
At one time dandruff was attributed to
be the result of a feverish condition of
the scalp, whiQh threw off the dried cuti-
cle In scales.
Professor Unna, Hamburg, Germany,
noted authority on skin diseases, explodes
this theory and says that dandruff is a
germ disease.
This germ is really responsible for the
dandruff and for so. many bald heads. It
can be cured if it is gone about In the
right way. The right way, of course, and
the only way, is to kill the germ.
Newbro's Herpicide does this, and
causes the hair to grow luxuriantly, just
as nature intended it should.

of Cuba for the ten months ending April
30, 1901, and the ten months ending April
30, 1900, has been prepared in the division

"WILLEMSTAD, Island of Curacao, Oct.
20.â The sum of JSOOO became due this
month to the United States from Venezu
ela on account of mixed American claims,
j and it has not been paid. The claims
arose out of damages sustained during the
revolution of 1SS2. They were adjudicated
between Venezuela and the United States
and the former agreed to pay $32,000 per
year in quarterly payments, with annual
interest on the sinking fund, the pay
ments to be divided pro rata among the
American claimants. This is the first in
stance where Venezuela has defaulted on
a quarterly payment.
The military situation on the Tachira
frontier apparently remains unchanged,
although the scouting and restless activ
ity of General Uribe-Uribe and his fol
lowers may result in an engagement with
the Colomoian troops of more or less im
portance any day. Nor is there any
â¢changa on the Guajira peninsula.
In various parts of Venezuela guerrilla
parties of Nationalists continue more or
less armed activity and minor uprisings
are frequently reported. President Castro
is vigorously repressing insurrection
wherever he can; but repression, instead
of discouraging the Nationalists, seems to
stimulate them to fresh operations. They
are not lacking in numbers, the principal
want being arms and ammunition.

that a strike will be averted or at all

Six hundred gendarmes are patrolling
Montceau-les-Mines. The manager of the
company does not leave his office except
in a carriage and under the escort of
mounted gendarmes, armed with revolvers
and sabers.
PARIS, Oct. 21.â Two meetings of the
delegates of the Miners' Federation were
held yesterday at St. Etienne without any
decision being reached upon the question
of the threatened strike. Another meet
ing will be held to-day. Meanwhile the
papers are devoting columns to the situa
tion and generally taking a gloomy view.
Dispatches from Montceau-les-Mines say
that, while the place is outwardly quiet,
the feeling is such that a very slight inci
dent would be likely to lead to an out
break of violence among the 8000 miners
in the locality. These are divided into
two factions â the "Reds," who favor a
strike, and the "Yellows," who are op
posed to such a step. The prefect, who
has forbidden the sale of arms through
out the department, yesterday seized two
cases of muskets at St. Etienne that were
on their way to Montceau-les-Mines. It
is asserted that both factions are already
supplied with guns and revolvers, which
they have concealed in their homes. One
of the leaders of the "Reds" declares that
they not only have Gras muskets but also
Lebet rifles, ammunition and bayonets.
The chief element of danger is the possi
ble action of some. 1200 men whom the
mining company refused to re-engage
after the last strike, and who have been
unemployed since.

sonal narmony.
In consequence of the condition of the
money market domestic loans were weak.
Imperial threes lost .065 and Prussian
threes .050. There was much short sell
ing of both. Foreign holders also sold.
Another cause of weakness was the rate
of new loans and the belief that the gov
ernment continues to sell the loans pri
vately, anticipating" the issue. It is now
regarded as certain that considerable new
loans will be floated the new year, both
imperial and Prussian.
Private discount advanced on the week
% of a point to 3 per cent, which was
maintained. The impulse to this was
chiefly the scarcity of money in Paris.
Considerable French paper was offered
here for discount. Another cause was the
Reichsbank's return for the week, which
proved somewhat unsatisfactory. It is
said the bank has been compelled to pro
long a number of bills in order to pre
vent insolvencies and other difficulties.
The Bourse gave considerable attention
to the negotiations between the Algemeine
Elkektricitaets-Geseddschaft of Berlin
and the Schuckert Electrical Company of
Nuremburg for establishing a community
of interest, arranging prices and saving
expenses in selling. The shares of the
latter company improved strongly in con
sequence.
German works are now securing orders
for locomotives in India. This Is ex
plained by the possibility of more rapid
delivery, owing to the fact that the Brit
ish works have heavy orders ahead. The
Prussian railroad authorities will soon
order 400 locomotives.
The sugaT syndicate has decided to re
duce production next year, owing t,o the
low prices and the amount of stock.
The alcohol syndicate has reduced prices
four marks Der hectolitre in the case of
crude alcohol.
Foreign Loans Still Weak.
A favorable factor was the buying of
coal and iron shares for foreign account.
It is asserted that considerable French
money was invested in such securities dur
ing the week and especially in coal shares,
upon the expectation of a coal strike in
France. On Wednesday from. 100,000 to
200,000 marks were invested in Harpener
coal for Paris account. There has also
been some British buying. A number of
Inquiries were received from abroad re
garding German Industrials making good
investment. Nevertheless coal shares
generally were neglected, domestic Inves
tors being influenced by American Im
ports of coal and the impending reduction
in prices.
The improvement in coal and iron shares
reached four points this week. The coke
market is described as "very feeble."
Stocks are accumulating, and it is con
sidered certain that the situation must in
crease the restriction of the output to 50
per cent. American railroad shares were"
the strongest features. Northern Pacific
preferred was heavily bought for New
York, gaining 4.12 points yesterday. On
the week, the gain was 6.62 points, closing
quotation being 104.62. Foreign rentes
were generally strong, particularly the
Chinese loan, owing to the signing of the
peace protocol. Italians were strong on
the fall of gold premium, but Spaniards
were weak.
BERLIN, Oct. 20. â Notwithstanding
much news from the Industrial centers,
the Boerse last week was- comparatively
strong. The volume of business remains
slight, outsiders holding aloof. Neverthe
less the feeling is somewhat more confi
dent.
French Money Invested in Coal.
Mines are hard; a general dullness char
acterizing that section. The recent at
tempt to boom Kaffirs has failed, despite
the permission of the authorities for the
starting of fifty additional Rand stamps,
and mining shares all closed fractionally
lower.
Money is still easy, but unless there Is
a prompt increase in ; the open ! market
rate gold shipments to Paris and Berlin
will soon be Inevitable.
The unusually good traffic reports made
home railroad shares the most favorable
features of the week, but these had no
effect upon the seneral list.
Experts do not look for any serious
break in the market, because the specula
tive public, whose timiaity usually pre
cipitates a panic, is wholly eliminated at
present; but they think it will be a long
while before there is any decided favor

NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Joe Nelson made
a remarkable showing for a boy still In
his teens at the Vallsburg cycle track to
day. He not only defeated his opponent
easily in a fifteen-mile motor-paced race,
but created new world's amateur records
for every mile excepting the fourth and
fifth. Fulton, Nelson's opponent, took the
lead at the start, but Nelson quickly over
hauled him and led at the end of the first
mile by fully three lengths. At five miles
Nelson lapped Fulton and repeated this in
the fifth, ninth .and thirteenth miles,
eventually winning by three and a half
laps, seven-eighths of a mile. Nelson's
time for the distance was 24:55 2-5.
One of the events, a motor handicap,
was a novelty. Albert Champion, al
though on a single motor bicycle, was
placed on scratch. He won easily, mak
ing world's motor records for nearly every
mile and covering the five miles in 6:25.

Marquis Ito would not be seen, being in
disposed, but Tsudzuki, who is authorized
to speak for him. said:
I really cannot say whether Japan will join
with the other nations In regard to the set
tlement with China. I know our country
signed the protocol with the others, but I
cannot say just what will be done further. It
may be necessary that China have a new com
mercial treaty with Japan. The Marquis can
not say what we will want or ask tor In thi3
connection. He has not. I am quite sure, any
pronounced views on the question of a Pacific
cable, except that he, like all the rest of the
people, would be pleased to see a cable laid.
Marquis Ito is much pleased at the advances
this Government has made in the East, as we
are, and he and all of us hope to see further
development there on their part.
To-morrow the Marquis will visit the
State Department and also pay his re

Admiral Bowles says that the Construc

He touches upon the tests of ttreproofed

that while the products of the two pro

Admiral Bowles strongly recommends
that tr.e floating drydock at Havana, re

Dr. Orville S. Burnett was born in Hast
ings, Nebr., about 28 years ago. He was
married seven years ago to Grace Ander
son, also of Hastings, who had been his
playmate and schoolmate from childhood.
Immediately afterward the family moved
to Denver. His father was. a wealtny
stockman, and the young man lived in
ease for years. Finally his wife urged
him to take up some profession, and he
decided to become a dentist. About three
years ago he came to Chicago to study.
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 20.â Nothing
is known here of Dr. Burnett, connected
with the suicide of Mrs. W. L. Nichol Jr.
at Chicago. Mrs. Nichol was a daughter
of Dr. F. A. Shoup. connected with the
University of the South at Sewaunee,
Tenn., and before her marriage was pop
ular socially both there and In Nashville,
where she spent part of her time.
W. L. Nichol Jr. is the son of the late
Dr. W. L. Nichol of Nashville, one of the
South's prominent physicians. He is at
present commercial agent at Chicago for
the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis
Railway, but had recently been promoted
and was to return to Nashville at an
early date to assume the duties of com
mercial agent at the company's head
quarters here.
A policeman who was sent to the Nichol
home at 651S Minerva avenue to-night to
notify Mr. Nichol of the tragedy found
no. one there but the two little children of
the dead woman, one a boy of eight and
the other a little girl of four years. They
told the policeman that their father was
"Our love was still strong for each
other," said Burnett, "and she" moved to
Chicago to be near me. We were together
nearly, every day. There seemed, however,
to be a constant remorse on her- part on
account of the dual life she was leading.
On Saturday we went down town to
gether, and, after having several drinks,
she proposed suicide to me. We went to
the! Marlborough Hotel and she produced
a bottle of morphine she had hidden In
her dress. She again asked me to die
with her and I consented. Then she
swallowed nearly all the contents of the
bottle and handed It to me. I drank what
was left, but, believing that I had not
taken enough to prove fatal, -I tried to end
my life by sticking the hat pin into my
neck. I saw this was also going to be a
failure, so I turned on all the gas and lay
down to die."
Burnett stated that his wife knew noth
ing of his attachment for Mrs. Nichol.
lotte Nichol. wife of W. L. Nichol
Jr., commercial agent of the Nashville,
Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway, com
mitted suicide to-day in the Marlborough
Hotel. Burnett tried to end his life at
the same time, but was unsuccessful.
The two were found in their rooms, both
stretched across a bed, the woman dead
and Burnett with his neck pierced by a
hat pin, a bottle of morphine clutched in
his hand and the gas turned on from
everyone of the six jets in the suite. Dr.
Burnett is still alive and has been ar
rested.
In one of the rooms was found a note
written by the woman, which told of her
reason for the act. It read:
To whom it may concern : I did it because I
loved him better than anything on earth, and
he loved me and we could not be separated.
Good-bye. CHARLOTTE.
The note, supplemented by a statement
made by Dr. Burnett, tells of the tragedy
enacted by the two lovers. =
According to the dentist's story, he met
Mrs. Nichol while she was yet a young
girl, In Nashville, Tenn., and fell in love
with her. Burnett moved to Chicago and
married several years afterward. ~

ARIZONA and New- Mexico have already en
tered actively upon the new campaign for
statehood and it is a foregone conclusion
that within a short time Oklahoma will join them.
The people of these Territories have long desired that
their commonwealths have the rights of States, and
they have repeatedly sought to obtain them. In the
present campaign therefore the / promoters of the
movement will have the advantage of appealing to a
sentiment already formed. In the Territories them
selves the movement will be well-nigh universally
supported, the sympathies of the West generally will \u25a0
be with them and even in the East there will be
found a strong element favorable to the change.
The claim of each of the Territories is good, for
each has a larger population and greater wealth than
were possessed by other Territories when admitted to
statehood. According to the last census Arizona
had a population in 1900 of 122,000, New Mexico a
population of 195.000, and Oklahoma 398,000. The
smallest of these populations is larger than, that of
several of the States. Moreover each of the appli
cants for statehood has just as bright prospects for
an increase of population and of industry as such
States as' Nevada, Wyoming and Idaho.
In the present condition of American politics it is
hardly likely that partisan considerations \u25a0\u25a0will have
much influence in determining the action of Con
gress upon the application for statehood. At pres
ent New Mexico and Oklahoma are regarded as Re
publican, while Arizona is Democratic. , Partisanship,
however, appears to be out of the question. In a
recent speech at a "statehood rally" at Phoenix Gov
ernor Murphy said: "It has in the past been a political
question and politics might be expected to retard

SIGNALING THROUGH FOGS.
"The Umbria of the same line, which was lying at
the Cunard pier in readiness to sail for England, is
fitted with the Marconi apparatus. Shortly after dawn
when the fog was at its thickest the message was
flung out on the heavy air from the pier in the North
River. A few minutes later aivnaswer came out of
the mist. ' The Lucania reported that she was an
chored outsidethe bar waiting for the fog to lift. At
9:30 she sent word that she was under way, but it
was nearly 12 o'clock before she reached her pier."
In that incident we have a plain, practical illustra
tion of the utility of the Marconi system of wireless
telegraphy. If the mail tender, like the Umbria, had
been fitted with the Marconi apparatus it would have
been easy for her captain to have found just where
the Lucania lay /and there would have been no ; grop
ing in the fog. The lesson can hardly be lost upon
the Government and jj.the experience of that mail
tender may hasten the' adoption by the Government
of a wireless telegraph system at every important

WIRELESS telegraphy is no longer a world's â¢
wonder. It has ceased to attract the atten
tion of those who note the progress of sci
ence and invention only through curiosity to learn of
some new marvel. On the other hand, it is increasing
its hold upon the minds of those who are interested
in its utility to the world of commerce and trade. It
is therefore worth noting that there has recently been
given in New York harbor a striking illustration of
its value in. that direction.
A short time ago the Lucania on her arrival off
New York harbor', found herself involved in a fog
so dense that she was compelled to cast anchor twice
on her way up the bay. The mail tender that was on
the outlook for her, so as to take the mails'and hurry
th,em to port, steamed around for hours without
being able to find her, 50 that, as the New York Press
said: "The mails for the Pacific Coast missed the or
dinary connection and the steamer at San Francisco
probably will have to wait at least a day for the
overland train.".
While the mail lender was uselessly groping
around in the fog the agents of the Cunard Line, to
which the Lucania belongs, were also anxious about
the steamer, but they did not have to grope for her.
They promptly made use of wireless telegraphy. The
Press says: . "â¢\u25a0

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has set
the seal of disapproval upon the
horse with a docked tail. In the
President's stable at the White
House are three superb coach
horses, recently purchased for the Presi
dent in New York by his brother-in-law,
Douglas Robinson, who was commissioned
to select the best animals for the purpose
that money could buy. All matter3 per
taining to the purchase were left to Mr.
Robinson, the President only insisting
that the animals' have especially fine, long
tails. In England King Edward recently
declared in favor of long-tailed horses for
all ceremonial purposes.
With the President's, disapproval and
the English monarch's disapproval it
can't be a matter of much time before the
docking of horses' tails will have passed
into memory as one of the barbaric and
hideous customs of the past.
I for one feel perfectly confident that
the banishment of the short-tailed ani
mal is a matter of to-day. Fashion is
going to do what the law could not ac
complish. I know that in some States,
and I also believe that in this one, there
is a law prohibiting the docking of horses'
tails. However, the law was a weak one
and it was the easiest thing in the world
for the owner of a horse with a docked
tail to declare that the tail was docked in
some other State but the one in which
the particular law should have been en
forced. It .is a pleasant thing to contem
plate that Fashion is going to accomplish
that which the law was powerless to do.
and furthermore accomplish it in much
quicker time and more summary manner.

Mrs. George Carr, who Is rehearsing the
belles andi: beaux who are to. take part' in
the "Florbdora" sextet in the vaudeville
end of the doll show, has by this time
discovered that an impresario's couch is
not one of roses. - Mrs. Carr in her work
has the valuable assistance of Mrs. Linda
Bryan, and I do not believe that there
could ari3e any managerial difficulties that
these two clever, tactful women could not
surmount.
The time has not yet arrived to make
public the names of- those who will take
part in the sextet. The greatest difficulty
thus far has been to get girls who belong
to the same clique. Some girls chosen
won't play if other girls who have been
chosen will, and therein lies the most seri
ous problem the manageresses have to
confront.
While there are any number of obliging
and willing participants, the sextet has
not yet been completed. Those already
chosen have had several rehearsals and
are doing splendidly. Twice last week
they met and rehearsed at Mrs. Bryan'a
home, and Tuesday evening they are to
Tehearse at Mrs. Berminshatn's residence.
Some time during the week they will hold
their rehearsals on the pretty little stage
of the Bella Vista.
Another serious question Mrs. Carr and
Mrs. Bryan are facing is the color of the
gowns for the "pretty, maidens." It must
be a color that will be most becoming to
all the girls, and as there is a diversity
of complexions in the sextet it does not
taite half an eye to see the import of the
color Question.

are guarding against the possibility, of an

TRADE ACTIVE BUT CONSERVA
TIVE.
In our local market we arc still busily engaged in
working off orders for merchandise accumulated
during the recent strike and some merchants are
complaining of the scarcity of cars, which retards
this work of clearing the decks. The commercial
part of the city is active and bids fair to continue
so for some time to come. Farm and orchard prod
uce continues to bring good prices, though raisins
and dried fruits are halting at the moment, the former
in consequence of dissensions among growers -and
packers and the latter owing to the heavy buying in
August 2nd September, which stocked everybody up
for the time being. All other lines of country prod
uce are reported in good movement, while merchan
dise is being moved as fast as our supply of cars and
drays can cany it away from wharf and store. There
is no dullness in trade in San Francisco.
The distributive trade of the country is good- in
all sections, except possibly in the South, where a
backward cotton crop movement has hampered the
usual fail trade and collections, but even in this sec
tion some improvement is observed. Cooler weather
and fear of frosts have stimulated raw cotton. Wool
is moving of? freely at firm prices and the woolen mills
ere generally busy, there being no reports of slug
gishness anywhere. Footwear factories still report
an active demand for their product and say that in
view of the advance in hides and leather one of two
things must soon occur â either prices for shoes must
advance or they must be made of inferior qualit\% to
equalize the higher prices for material. r The iron
trade is in as good shape as ever, the mills being
filled with orders, many of them for months ahead.
The persistent prosperity in this line during the past
several years is surprising. Coal and lumber are also
quoted firm and active almost everywhere. The only
staples that have lagged are the cereals, notably
wheat/and the feeling in this grain has become more
bullish during the pa?t few days, owing chiefly to
persistent reports of increasing damage to the Ar
gentine ciop by drought, though much of this is
regarded as exaggerated.
But in spite of this conservatism business continues
to e.\pand. The country's bank clearings, which are
accepted as the most reliable indicator of the condi
tion of trade, show, week after week, an unvarying
gain over the corresponding periods last year. Some
times the percentage of increase runs up to 6o and
over and sometimes falls to 20 and even less, but it
is always ahead of the preceding year. The clearings
last week showed a gain of 26.2- per cent, and with
the exception of New Orleans and St. Paul every im
portant trade center in the country exhibited an in
crease. This tells the commercial story. The failures
for the week were 229. against 209 last year. They
have been running ahead of the previous 3"car for a
number of months, but are almost always small and
# unimportant. Seldom do we see one that attracts the
attention of the country at. large, as was the case five
or six rears ago.
s-^ OXSERVATISM still characterizes the b'usi-
I ness situation all over the country. At the
two great centers of speculation, New York
and Chicago, there is a noticeable lack of thst fever
ish activity which so often prevails in stock and
grain trading. Neither market is really dull, how
ever, and an occasional spurt in wheat or corpora
tion shares shows that but little stimulation is needed
to provoke eager speculation. Money is plentiful
everywhere and is easily accessible at moderate rates
ot interest, and the long period of prosperity enjoyed
by the country has thoroughly imbued the trading
public with confidence in the future. But the New
York banks are going slow. The3 r are scrutinizing
industrial securities before making loans and have
Istely been weeding out of their loan accounts a good
many which the}' consider doubtful. This course acts
as a safety valve on Wall street and maintains as
much stability in values as is ever seen in that busy
mart and imparts a feeling of confidence throughout
all lines of trade.

urge its adoption.
The suggestion in itself is attractive. A world's
exposition in our time is a very complex affair and
does not fall far short of being a veritable city during
its existence. It contains many buildings of different
kinds designed for different purposes, and it would
seem that they might be grouped in such a way with
reference to the parks and gardens of the exposition
as to form a really valuable object lesson in the art
of beautifying municipalities.
The proposed plan, if adopted, would in the first
place give the St. Louis exposition a novelty in the
way of attraction. The expositions of the past have
been planned few the purpose of producing many
kinds of architectural effect, but not. one of them has
been anything like that of a model city. Of course
much in the way of beauty and architectural
effect might be lost .-through the adoption of a
scheme that would arrange the buildings along regu
lar streets, but at the same time something would
also be gained. In the hands of competent men the
street vistas of the St. Louis exposition might be
made as effective in some ways as the great court of
honor at the Chicago exposition. - . :. .
As outlined in a- report made to the National Arts
Club the plan proposes that the departments of the
exposition which are the same as similar departments
in modern cities be treated so as* to form working
models of what such departments should be. These
include engineering, street cleaning, garbage disposal,
water supply, police, fire and health departments,
parks, tree-planting and other matters of that nature.
Furthermore, the plan involves "\ the \u25a0 treatment of
parks and plaza spaces, street crossings and other
vistas, and the grouping and architecture of other
structures and other lines in'which esthetic effects are'
desirable and practicable without sacrifice of economy
and utility. Finally, there -would be a complete ex
position of model lampposts, street* signs, letter
boxes, paper receptacles, park settees, street-cleaning
machinery and all other appliances that make up the
accessories of modern city life. .
Whether the plan can be made acceptable to the
St. Louis Commissioners remains to be seen. It will
of course be natural for the Commissioners to desire
to follow the old way and group their exposition
buildings so as to make the greatest spectacular ef
fect, and consequently a purely utilitarian grouping
may not be pleasing to them. It is certain, however,
that if such a plan be adopted and carried out with
efficiency under competent control there would be a
good deal , of gratification throughout the country.
The American people are very-much interested just
now in municipal improvement and adornment, and
a model city on a large scale would in itself prove a
popular exposition and a drawing one.
\ .
AN effort is being made by the National Arts
.' Club to induce the Commissioners of the St.
Louis Exposition to arrange the grouping of
the various buildings so as to present the aspect of
"a model city." A plan for the work has been for
mulated in a tentative way and a committee ap
pointed to confer with the exposition authorities and
A MODEL CITY.
Since young Rockefeller married a New England
girl the New England papers have been looking up
his college record and the Boston Globe reports that
he "was scrupulously exact in his accounts, 'never
believed in nor practiced the American habit of treat
ing and as athletic manager insisted that every man
should pay his own way." Nothing is said about his
standing as a student and apparently that no longer
counts in New England college life.
Logically he should carry his talents over to the
socialists and communists, whose ideas he made as
effective as possible while he was Mayor of Boston.
In this speech he said: "No intelligent observer of
politics can believe that our party is now going back
to its political attitude of a decade ago. Many point
to election returns as showing that its new spirit is
unprofitable. But it should be remembered that a
period of great and widely diffused prosperity is not
one in which men turn readily to those who offer
them radical remedies for ills in the body politic.
It was said -that Napoleon, in his disastrous winter
invasion of Russia, was defeated by General January.
In my opinion it was General Prosperity who de
feated Colonel Bryan. But General Prosperity has
always turned deserter in the past. If, unfortunately,
adversity declines to be permanently banished, possi
bly advanced Democracy may be more popular than
of late."
Is : that cynicism, pessimism or what? Does Mr.
Quincy mean that adversity is preferable to pros
perity? Does he intend to argue that his party has
no policy acceptable to a prosperous people and can
only be accepted by them in adversity? If so, it is
incumbent upon him to show that when it comes to
victory in partnership with famine, it must have the
power to restore the very prosperity upon whose
downfall it has depended for its opportunity.
The citizens of a republic may well feel suspicious
of a party which makes proclamation of its intention
to take advantage of adversity to get power. Grant
ing Mr. Quincy's entire sincerity, his declaration
can have no other meaning than that his party's pol
icy, as a minority, is to do all that a minority can to
bring adversity upon the country, to the end that its
radicalism may be more popular and that it may get
power. . â¢'. .
Surely there is but slight hope that conservative
men will see in this a reason for helping Mr. Quincy
to the Governorship of Massachusetts in order to
strengthen the party which sees its only hope of a
Federal victory in national adversity.
Following Mr. Quincy a speech was made by Mr.
Loughlan, ex-Mayor of Fall River, who said: "We
have fought the fool's fight long enough." Whether
! that was intended for Colonel Bryan or Mr. Quincy
I the ex-Mayor of Fall River did not explain.
One fails to sec anything original in this. It is a
repetition of the scheme of fusion of incongruities
which has been twice attempted by Mr. Bryan and
has twice failed. Mr. Quincy points to 22,000 votes
cast in Massachusetts for two Socialist candidates for
Governor as evidence of drift toward that political
school. If that drift is in a right political direction
why does he find fault with it? If it is wrong why
does he make a strong socialistic and communistic
platform and invite the drifters to come in and stand
on it? His whole attitude is a concession of the
rightness of radicalism. Does he suppose that it will
be satisfied to remain incorporated with the Demo
cratic party unless it can make that party represent
its radical policies? Apparently .not, for he invites
it to come in and through Democracy, as a medium
make its radicalism effective. Mr. Quincy is a very
scholarly gentleman, but he seems blind to some
things that arise of necessity in his invitation to the
men who left his party because it was too radical v to
come back and join men who have left it because it
was not radical enough. Such a union is impossible
unless it is entirely leconciled by the desire to get
office and power.
AT a meeting of the Democratic Club of Massa
chusetts Josiah Quincy, candidate for Gov
ernor, made a significant speech. Presenting
Democracy in this country as the analogue of the
several liberal parties in Europe, he declared that in
Great Britain and on the Continent those parties
were all dead and that Socialism had administered
on their estate and taken their place as the political
opposition of the parties that support the Govern
ment. He warned his hearers that the breakdown
of Liberalism abroad may indeed be regarded as a
threatening portent for Democracy in America. "I
would therefore say to the man for whom the recent
attitude of the Democratic party has been too radical,
'Come with us and exercise your proper voice within
the party to steady its action.' I would say also to
the man who complains, as not a few do, that the
Democratic party is not yet radical enough, 'Come
with us and make your advanced radicalism an effec
tive factor, instead of an empty protest.' "
This means a fusion within the party of former
Democratic conservatism with the advanced radical
ism which goes to the extreme of state communism,
all for the purpose of welding an opposition to "the
party which supports the Government."
tion would not be changed. Besides, though I am
a Republican, I would rather live in a Democratic
State than a Republican Territory."
To the people of the Territories the issue is not
one of politics merely. They are convinced that their
business and industrial interests would be advanced
by statehood. Thus at -the ..Phoenix -meeting Judge
Kebbey, a former Chief Justice ol the Territory, said:
"It is worth a great deal to say. one lives in a State.
The very word 'Territory' carries with it \ stigma
in the business world that means a loss'/o.f .business."
It is to be noted finally that the advocates of the
movement are counting much upon the well-known
Western sympathies of the President. It is believed
that Roosevelt will cordially co-operate in procuring
the desired action by Congress. The outlook is cer
tainly more promising than ever before and it is not
at all improbable that President Roosevelt will have
the satisfaction of adding three additional stars to the
glorious galaxy in the national banner.

Successful Outing Held
by Iron Trades
Council.
The Iron Trades Council held its first
annual picnic at Shell Mound Park yes
terday in behalf of the strikers. The af
fair lasted throughout the afternoon and
evening and an exceptionally large crowd
was in attendance. The entertainment
consisted for the most part of sports and
dancinsr. \u25a0
Aspirants for public office were so much
in evidence that the picnic seemed like a
political gathering at times. Candidates
of all kinds mingled with the crowds, be
stowing genial smiles and grasping the
hand of every one who looked like a
voter. Eugene Schmltz and about all of
his associates on the Union Labor ticket
appeared and were cordially received. Mr.
Sclimitz mace a brief address, compli
menting the members of the iron trades
unions and advocating the uolicy of vot
ing his way. â¢ Police Juuge Conlan and
City Attorney F. K. l^ane were also pres
ent. â¢ \u25a0
The event of most interest in the day's
amusement was a tug-of-war between the
married and unmarried men, in which
the latter came off victorious.
The picnic was very successful finan
cially, about $4500 being realized, which
will be donated to the strike fund.
Credit for the admirable management of
the outing is due mainly to the efforts of
the following committees: â¢
Arrangementsâ J. J. Wallace, L. Adams, H.

H. A. Baker with the pistol. He shot two
scores in sharpshooter's formâ a 58 and 52
â and was only beaten eight points for
first honors with the pistol during- the
day. He is a new member and the young
est shooter in the club, and bids fair to
beat the best. A. B. Dorrell led with the
fine rifle. Dr. Twist was high mafi with
the 22 rifle. A. J. Brannagan, with the
revolver, equaled the best pistol score by
Young. Ed Hovey was first in the Creed

BEACON and Rector, the fast grey- ,
hounds from Albert Curtis' ken
nel, which were nominated by
their owner for the great John
Grace cup stake, reached the de
ciding course of that event yesterday at
Union Coursing Park. It was not deemed
expedient to run the all-important final
course, as darkness had settled down on
the field, rendering it impossible to give
the fleet dogs a fair trial.
The running of the classic stake result
ed in many great trials. The spectators
who filled the stand were denied the op
portunity of seeing the best of the sport,
owing to the fog which obscured the field.
Palo Alto showed "plainly the result oE
his hard work in the run down on Satur
urday. In his course with Sisquoc he was
retired without a point to his credit. Sis
quoc had a tight hold on a chance in the
final and it seemed he was the strongest
and steadiest dog in the stake. After de
feating Little Sister,' Healey's champion
met Charta and beat her in a long-, heart
breaking course. Only the finish of the
trial could be seen from the stand, but
when Judge Grace came in from the fog j
bank he was loud in his praises of the
Petaluma courser and declared the trial"
one of the best he had ever judged.
About this time the fog settled in heavy
banks in front of the slipper's box and
James Grace was forced to give the dogs
the shortest of "slips" to keep them
sighted on their game.
Many spectators hoped for Sisquoc's
sake that the running of the semi-finals
would be postponed, but were disappoint
ed. Beacon came out a fresher dog and
defeated Sisquoc in a short trial.
Rector ran a great dog, though a trifle
wild. In the fourth round, had not Luxor
killed too soon, Rector would have been
retired.
Vandal and Charta ran well. In fact,
the stake was a succession of clever
courses. The deciding course between
Beacon and Rector will be run at Union
Park' on Sunday next.
In the Consolation stake, for dogs beat
en on Saturday, T. J. Mclnerney's Annie
Hall took first honors, beating A. T. Leon
ard's Game Boy In a course that was seen
only by Judge Grace and his attendants
in the field. Game Boy had beaten Tibu
ron in the semi-final, rolling up a heavy
score, and the talent erred in-making him
a favorite.
Greenhall beat Elista in the final of the
Special stake by a score of 12 to 8.

Oakland's infieldlng at times was a com
edy oi" errors. Some of these errors con
tributed to the three runs Sacramento se
cured in the third inning. Devereaux went
to first on four balls. Sullivan hit an easy
one past the pitcher and made first on
what should have been an out. McNeely
sacrificed, advancing each man one base.
Flood hit safely, sending Devereaux home
1'cr the first run.
Hanson. Oakland's catcher, threw to
second to catch Flood and Sullivan scored
on the play. Sheehan hit to shortstop. Ea
gan on flrst dropped the ball, which
bounded over the fence into the crowd.
Sheehan did not make the best use of his
time on the base lines, as he was caught
out at the plate when he might have
added to the Senators' score.
In the second inning Davis tried to steal
second while the ball -was in the pitcher's
hands, but failed.
Sacramento made it two straight yes
terday with Oakland, capturing both the
morning and the afternoon game. The
men from across the bay played in a per
functory manner at Recreation Park, ex
cept in the eighth inning, when two of
their runs were scored.
Drennan was given a pass to first. Han
son hit safely and went to second on a
throw intended to shut off Drennan on
third. Hamilton bunted, filling the bases.
Schmidt flew out. Mohler hit safely, scor
ing Drennan, but forcing Hamilton out at
second. Dunleavy followed with a good
two-bagger, scoring Hanson and sending
Mohler to third. Babbitt retired the side
before any more runs could be scored.
The Corinthian fleet, with Commodore
H. D. Hawks' sloop May in the lead,
cruised yesterday from Tiburon Cove to
ward Sausalito and thence with the chan
nel, where a fine sailing breeze was blow
ing. Several yachts of the San Francisco
Club joined the fleet, which presented a
beautiful sight as it beat out toward the
city front. Nearly the whole Corinthian
fleet was under way. among: the yachts
being the sloops Edna, Emma, Aeolus,
Harpoon, Merope, Nixie and the yawls
Frolic, Spray and Kittiwake. At one time
thirty-nine yachts could be counted, of
which the yawls Phyllis and Royal and
the sloops Thetis. Mischief and Surprise
carried the San Francisco flag, while Com
modore Caduc flew the flag of the Oak
land Canoe Club on his fine sloop Annie.
Dr. T. L. Hill took his sloop Cygnus up
to Corte Madera Creek, where she will lie
during the winter.
On returning to her moorings at Sausa
lito the sloop Thetis was stripped of her
grear, which was stowed in the clubhouse.
Next Sunday she will be towed over to
Tiburon Cove and will enter the lagoon
when the bridge is raised.

being 5-7, 6-3 (George withdrew).
With Grant Smitn out of the tourna
ment the first class looked to be easy for
Collier, but he went down in the finals
before Fred Brown, the University of Cal
ifornia man, who played a fine game.
The tournament committee made a mis
take when tiiey put young Graham in the
second class instead of the third. He hus
had no experience, and although he made
a good showing, he should have been a
class lower. In the second class Cornell
was a strong favorite, but Frank String
ham the class winner, beat him handhy
jn the first round. Young Smith put up a
good game but Stringham, outplayed him
in the finals.

In a close football game, exciting for
both participants and spectators, the
Phoenix Athletic Club eleven defeated
the Hammond Athletic Club team by a
score of 5 to 0 s.t the Sixteenth and Fot
som streets grounds. The teams were of
about the same weight and evenly
matched, but the winners were a trifle
quicker and more snappy in their play.
The only scoring- was done in the early
part of the first half when the Phoenix,
after bucking for about fifty yards, final
ly sent Packacher. the fullback, over the
line for a touchdown. Deane failed to
kick goal. Phoenix won by consistent,
steady team work and ability to hold
their opponent3 at critical times. Both
teams were weak on defensive work.

for the winners. The teams lined up a3

tested for rapidity of fire and accuracy,
but at the conclusion of these tests tha
most promising weapons will be taken to
Fort RHey. Kansas, and placed In the
hands of artillerymen there for further
test. This last trial is to be had because
experience in the field has shown that
many weapons that have functioned per
fectly on the well-appointed testing
grounds are unable to stand the trial ot
actual service. The fortifications board
will hold another meeting here on tha

WASHINGTON. Oct. 20.â The fortifica

Sandy Hook witnessed the preparations
making: for the approaching trial of field
guns tor the artillery. Several such guns
were already on the grounds and were un
dergoing private tests preliminary to thu
official trials which will begin next week
and probably last three weeks. The Lewis
gun, currently reported to be an improved
model of \u25a0 the French field eun. was one
of the most noteworthy pieces on the field.
Owing to the omission of the mechanics
to change the oil cylinders it appeared at
first that this gun was a failure. How
ever, the omission being discovered, tha
ensuing tests were attended with such re
markable success that the board felt war
ranted in predicting that it would prove a
formidable competitor for the first place
In the competition, the result of which will
be to supply the United States artillery
arm with a new modern gun. Another
weapon of the rapid-firing- type whtch has
attracted the attention of the board was
the new German field gun.

MEXICO flTT. Oct. 20.â Embassador
Clayton, acting under instructions from
the State Department at Washington, has
been investigating the case of W. N.
Mealey, an American mining man under
arrest at Monterey. While the Embassa
dor was working to secure Mealey's re
lease under bail, news came that he had
been released, but was rearrested â¢ on
charges of robbery and perjury. The Em
bassador does not yet know the basis, of
the charges. Mealey's case has been In
the courts more or less for several years.
As the result of the present litigation,
the arrest of Mealey came about In con
nection with mining cases, and the point
is made that an American permanently
residing in Mexico never intending to re
turn to the United States, paying no
taxes there and performing none of j the
duties of a. citizen, loses his standing with
the Mexican Government. If this prin

Working in connection with a land force,
which devoted > its attention to the
\u25a0wharves, the party on the Governor Ir
win secured a set of pictures of peculiar
value.
WRECK IN MINE
BRINGS DEATH
Another of the club's force got into quite
a serious mix-up in the Latin quarter.
Anxious to get a picture of the operation
of winemaking, n.pw in full swine: in Xiittle
Italy, he secured permission to enter one
of the numerous basements in which the
grape juice is transformed into the "red
paint" of Bohemia. Without giving any
warning he took a flashlight picture. He
was instantly attacked and his camera
taken away from* him. He was then
forcibly ejected. He recovered his camera
later, but not until somebody with a
knowledge of photography had exposed all
his plates to the light.
Taking the amateur photographer by the
arm the janitor led him, not too gently,
to the street^ As the bewildered Camera
Club man walked away he overheard the
janitor mutter:
"It '11 be a cowld day whin the likes of
him can tell the likes of me that Tiddy
Rusenfilt has a mug like that. I'll 'our
prisident' the nixt Orangeman that thries
that game wid me."
Knows Only One President.
"Ye dirty .blackguard. Now be off wid
ye! Be off wid ye! I might have let ye
take the picture. Maybe ye'd have bin
able to sell some to the old man. But
whin ye lie to me â be off, now."
vented by a burly child of Erin from pho
tographing an interior, exhibited his offi
cial badge. This badge consists of a yel
low ribbon on which is mounted a button
bearing the picture of J. W. Erwin. Un
derneath the picture are the words "Our
president." ~
The janitor looked at the picture long
and carefully. He spelled out the inscrip
tion.
ONE OF THE PICTURESQUE SNAPSHOTS TAKEN ALONG THE WATER FRONT BY THE CAMERA CLUB IN
ITS SELF-APPOINTED TASK OF PHOTOGRAPHING SAN FRANCISCO. THE BATTERY OF CAMERAS WAS
AGAIN IN ACTION ALL DAY YESTERDAY.
"Family life is the basis of social order
and individual happiness. But those who
plead for more liberal marriage terms are
not lax or immoral. The majority of them
are not men, but women. Such laws are
principally favorable to women and they
make another step toward the emancipa
tion of women. It is a move toward
greater economic independence. Women
must be able to earn a living outside law
ful or unlawful sex relations. Marriage
is no longer the only way-by which they
can obtain support.
"If the-'Bishops "seriously wish to pre
serve the family, you and I could easily
tell them what to do. They are men of
wide influence and spotless livesâ yes; but
let each of them become a total abstainer
and constantly preach total abstinence. I
think in that way more could be done to
preserve the family than by any legisla
tion with regard to marriage laws."
Emancipation of Women.
"The truth seems to be that the House
of Bishops is getting to represent reac
tionary conservatism. In the matter of
divorce, of the freer use of church ser
vice, of the extension of Episcopal care
to congregations whose clergymen had
not been ordained by the Bishops, the
upper house took an ultra conservative
position. The medieval view of marriage
which the Bishops wished to make the
law of the church would have been fas
tened on us but for such strong voices
raised in protest as those of Dr. Hunting
ton and Dr. Greer. The upper and lower
houses are pulling more and more apart.
"In the matter of divorce the House of
Bishops came perilously near putting
itself in a most unenviable position. It is
not a function of religion or of the church
to mend moral matters by legislation. Re
ligious teaching- exhorts, illustrates, but
does not force. Any effort to use force
becomes absurd when it is remembered
that Protestantism has no means of en
forcing its laws. But that is Just the glory
of Protestantism. It uses neither force
nor fear.
Two Houses Drifting Apart.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Rev. Percy B.
Grant, preaching to-day in the Church of
the Ascension, was outspoken in his criti
cism of the doings of the recent triennial
convention of the ' Protestant Episcopal
church, and especially of the attitude of
the Hous"e of Bishops toward the more
important questions before the conven
tion. Having- paid a strong tribute to the
men comprising the lower house. Mr.
Grant turned his attention to the House
of Bishops, which he said had plenty and
to spare of natural ability. .
"The House of Bishops," he said, "is a
conservative body. A newspaper the
other day said that the church itself was
conservative, and that being so it sus
tained its own conservatism by doing
nothing. The triennial convention can
hardly v.-ith advantage to the church
travel 3000 miles to ban Francisco and
then S000 miles back again without hav
ing done anything at all. And the con
vention now concluded did nothing.

Mrs. Thorpe, a middle-aged wcjman, and
her two children, aged respectively 5 and
7 years, arrived here last night from
North" Dakota and being penniless were
given lodgings in the City Prison. About
two years ago'Mrs. Thorpe was divorced
from her husband, who conducts a bar
ber shop in Fresno. Recently, she claims,
he wrote to her asking her to join him in
this city and remarry him. Thinking that
he meant it, Mrs. Thorpe at once packed
her trunk and taking her two children
with her started for this city. To her sur

her at the ferry as he promised. - She is

An old man whose Identity is yet uncer

car near the Nine-mile House yesterday
afternoon. It is supposed that he com
mitted suicide. "When the motorman first
saw him. he was sitting in the middle "of
the track. The car was traveling at a
high rate of speed and the distance to the
imperiled man was so short that the
brakes were of little service.
The motorman, as soon as he saw the
figure ahead of him, rang his bell violent
ly. Instead of arousing the man from, his
perilous position the sound of the bell did
not disturb him, and in an instant the car
struck him and knocked him several feet
from the track. The man died a short
time afterward at Ocean View. He was
severely injured about the head.
In the victim's pocket was found a pay
envelope issued from â¢ the boiler-making
department of the Union Iron "Works. The
name on the envelope was partly erased,

AND LOSES LIFE
Wilhelmlna Hupfeld, wife of Dr. Julius
Hupfeld, the capitalist and retired .physi
cian, passed away at her Oak-street home
in this city on Friday night at the age of
58 years. Mrs. Hupfeld had been ill for
some months, and weeks ago the physi
cians who were called into consultation
realized that there was no hope of saving
her life. Although paralysis rendered her
helpless during her closing days, she was
conscious to the last and accepted her
fate with cheerful resignation.
Dr and Mrs. Hupfeld had been married
forty years. Theirs was a beautiful wed
ded life, for, lovers always, the two score
milestones that they passed were but
Time's record of one long honeymoon.
Mrs Hupfeld was a woman of unusual
charm of character, and her demise has
brought mourning to many a household
to which her fine personality had en
deared itself. The funeral, which will
take place to-day, will be strictly private,
and in accordance with the wishes of the
deceased the body will be cremated at
Odd Fellows' Cemetery.

Gus Martironi of 58 Manchester street
had a lively time yesterday afternoon
with" a number of the youths of Bernal
Heights. Martironi gave a party to a
number of his friends and while the merri
ment was at its height volleys of rocks
were hurled at his dwelling. He stood
this as long as possible, but when the
broken glass from the windows began to
mix up with the salad and put a sharp
edge on the wine. he sallied forth.
Some say that he was armed with' a
pistol and carving knife. Others say he
fired at the crowd of boys as they ran
away from him. He gave them chase, was
Intercepted by a number of citizens and
taken to the patrol box at the cornerof
Twenty-sixth and Folsom streets. Tne
Seventeen-street police station was noti
fied that a riot was in progress at Bernal
Heights and Lieutenant Anderson and a
posse of officers were soon on the scene.
The boys who were the cause of the
trouble ran away on the approach of the
police. Martironi was questioned and
denied having fired a shot or used a
knife After taking his name and address
the police allowed him to go home and
join his interrupted party.

The nominees of the Union Labor party
are greatly disturbed because of their

the division In the union ranks is grad

is soon restored not a man on the ticket
will be elected. Efforts are now making
to reconcile the warring factions with a
view to harmonizing rather than dividing
the labor vote. Unless the breach be

declare the cause of the Union Labor

noon.from the effects of the wound.
Lynch, who was over 50 years of age,
was walking along Harrison street, and
when near Eighth he noticed a crowd of
strikers attacking two non-union team
sters named Roscoe Home and William
Ferguson. After being assailed with
stones the colored men drew their revol
vers and fired into the crowd. One of the
bullets struck Lynch in the groin. He
was at once removed to his home at 352
Eleventh street and the family physician
summoned. For a time the unfortunate
man seemed to be on the road to recovery,
and his family, consisting of a wife and
seven children, were correspondingly
happy. About a week ago blood-poison

Shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday after

AGED PETKR LYNCH

The remarkable speech delivered by Asa
R. Wells at Metropolitan Temple Satur
day evening was generally discussed In
rolitical and business circles yesterday.
The profundity of thought It displayed,
its wonderful depth of reasoning, its
lucidity and forceful logic have comblnou
to stamp Mr. "Wells as a campaign orator
whose talents would put the blush oi
envy upon the brazen cheek of a dime
museum sj>ieler.
The Republican nominees who heard
Mr. Wells pay a tribute to the malodorous
"solid nine" and to the present Board of
Supervisors, whose big surplus he re
garded as an excellent campaign docu
ment, are wondering if the gentleman who
aspires to the Mayoralty was- not seized
with that species of stage fright which
in the classic language of Richard Mans
field "makes one feel like the deuce of
spades with the spots rubbed off."
On no other hypothesis can they ex
plain Mr. Wells' irruption of prattle and
inanities, the conspicuous merit of which
was its utter absence of anything like
a thought worthy of imagination of a
bronze statue. His declaration that he
had served time at the City I'all was
generally regarded as a witticism, but it
loses its force under the burden of the
depressing conviction that the time was
not spent 10 advantage,
Mr. Wells' speech was a gem of its
kind, but the quality was nothing that
the most obsequious kowtowing political
parasite would care to brag about. That
it was worthy of Mr. Wells, all agree;
but that it was worthy of a nun who has
been in the public harness for three years,
imbibing knowledge of municipal affairs
with which to fortify himself for the dis
charge of the manifold duties of Mayor,
no sane man is willing to admit. In his
Xirst public discussion of tne local cam
paign issues the gentleman proved be
yond Question his thorough uniitness for
the distinguished office to which his vault
ing ambition aspires.
"Wells' Attitude Quiescent.
It is generally conceded that Mr. Wells
outlined by his silence his quiescent atti
tude toward the burning issues of the
campaign. Whether he intends to reduce
the price of gas and water to consumers,
or see to It that the Geary-street railway
franchise reverts to the city on Its expira
tion are secrets hidden In his breast
Whether it is his intention if elected
Mayor to Increase the public school facili
ties or carry to completion many needed
public improvements, whÂ»ch include the
construction of sewers and the paving of
streets, is left exclusively to the imagi
nation of the dear public â¢whose votes he
solicits. What he thinks of the extrava
gant Board of Public Works and of the
Civil Service Commission, in relation to
which his hired shouters are clamoring
for reform, tie studiously keeps to him
self.
What his attitude If elected will be
toward the granting of franchises to rail
way corporations in accordance with
charter provisions Mr. Wells alone knows,
if, indeed, he ever gave that Important
subject sf passing thought. While his hear
ers were awaiting with anxiety for his
views upon these weighty subjects now
occupying the attention of all citizens Mr.
Wells delivered himself of platitudes.
Instead of discussing topics of general
interest he told how he worked four vears
at $10 a month and was nevertheless en
abled to show a surplus at .the end of that
period. In his next breath he stultifies his
own party by furnishing his meed of praise
for the present Board of Supervisors, the
majority of which is Democratic, because
of its surplus at the close of the past
fiscal year.
He condemned his official course as Au
ditor for permitting the Supervisors to
spend $12,000,000 after the ante-election
promise of the members to run the affairs
of the city at a cost not to exceed $4,000,
* 000 a year. Then by way of variety he
paradoxically alluded to the Mayor as
being harmless unless he was surrounded
by Supervisors who operated harmonious
ly with him. He concluded finally with
the statement that if he is given a Board
of Supervisors of the same political faith
as himself "he thinks he could do as
well." And so he proceeds in a discourse
which is hopelessly devoid of sense or rea
son until thanks are cordially expressed
for a reception whose frigidity chilled the
suffering audience and his fellow nomi
nees to the very marrow.
Candidates Are Disappointed.
Several of the Republican candidates ex
pressed their disappointment quite openly
yesterday. In some instances the fear
was expressed that Mr. Wells* candidacy
seriously menaced the success of the
ticket. One candidate for Supervisor stat
ed that if Mr. Wells was allowed to make
another speech the Republican ticket was
hopelessly lost. It Is unlikely that Man
ager Cobb will allow his employer to make
any other address during the campaign
and an assurance to that effect will be
necessary to revive the flagging courage
of the Republican nominees
It has developed that the Republican
Supervisorial nominees were pledged to a
definite course of action toward the rail
way, gas and water companies through
the agency of Jerry Burke, a Democratic
politician in the service of Mr. Herrin of
the Southern Pacific Company Be'or*

Two holdups, evidently by the same
man, occurred early yesterday morning
In the vicinity of Stockton and Broadway.
Charles Romano, feT barber living at 744
Broadway, was within a few feet of his
home about 1 o'clock yesterday morning
when he was approached by a man wear
ing a mask made of a piece of a pink
shirt..
"Throw up your hands," ho said, as he
pointed a pistol at Romano.
Instead of complying, Romano grabbed
the pistol and a lively struggle ensued.
The would-be robber was a strong, man/
but Romano, who, during the struggle,
was loudly calling for the police, was get
ting the better of. his assailant, when,
noticing an officer approaching, by a final
effort the robber succeeded In getting the
weapon away from Romano.
Officer Peshon came up at this" time and
gave chase, but lost his man In one of the
dark alleys that abound in the neighbor
hood. During the struggle the mask
worn by the robber was dropped and is
now in the custody of the police. Romano
was severely bruised during the struggle,
having been knocked down, but plucklly
continued the fight. â¢ â¢
About fifteen minutes later, Antonio
Garpia, who was passing through the
same neighborhood, was held up by a
man wearing a white silk handkerchief
for a mask. Garpia was covered by a
revolver in the hands of the thief and
yielded up 45 cents. He was told to walk
on and as he '.urned a corner his assail
ant disappeared.
Garpia notified the police at once and
the description given of the thief by him
and Romano tally very closely. He is
described as being about five feet eight
inches in height, weighing 160 pounds and
broad-shouldered. A search of the neigh
borhood was made for him a second time,
but he was not found.
