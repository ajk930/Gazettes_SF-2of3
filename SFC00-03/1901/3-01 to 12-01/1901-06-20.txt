. Senator Perkins and Congressman Mat
calf have decided to renew their work at
the coming session of Congress in favor
of plan No. 3, as described in the fore
going resume.
. ' The Oakland Board of Trade has Issued
a statement concerning the matter, which
is as follows::-, - :
The appropriation which . our Senator and
Congressman succeeded in getting Into the
river and harbor bill, after s very hard fight,
was the j third estimate i of Colonel Heuer.
T36S.203. providing for 500 feet wide and 35 feet
deep to Chestnut! street, thence 300 feet wlda
and 25 feet deep to Fallon street, thenca 200
feet wide and 17 feet deep to Brooklyn Basin,
thence 300 feet 'wide " and 13 feet deep up to
and around the basin.
Owing to the failure of the passage of tha
entire river and harbor bill this appropriation
fell to the "ground.' But It Is the' belief of our
Senator and Congressman that they can secure
similar recognition in the next river and har
bor bill, but that It would be very Injudicious
to attempt to change the plan or work to which
consent has practically already been obtained
with treat difficulty.
The ' Board of Trade,- while recognizing the
desirability of having further improvements In
depth and width of channel and petitioning
therefor, also recognizes the difficulty and un
certainty that always attend the getting of ap
propriations and. concludes that It is tha wise
'.course to accept the appropriation as proposed
/in the -bill and â¢ heretofore agreed to by the
river and ' harbor i committee. ' as . in the main
it meets the pressing immediate requirements.'
'and think it wise to leave the securing of bet
terments to future efforts rather than attempt
to secure at this time amendment to the bill
already proposed which would increase tha ap
propriation, '.which Â» is already large, thus id*

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON. Ariz., June 19.â In the San
Pedro country yesterday Tom Burns,
notorious throughout Arizona and South
ern California as a gun fighter, was killed
by a cowboy named Wallace at Tom Wil
lis* ranch. Burns had been punching
cows for Willis and could not get along
with Wallace. Burns on several occa
sions had jumped off his horse' ta fight
Wallace and threatened his life.
Yesterday Wallace and. Burns were dis
charged because they were quarreling' all
the time. Burns went to the corral and
saddled his horse. Riding up to the house
he swung out of the saddle and said he
was going to kill Wallace before he went
farther. Wallace, who was in the house,
heard the threat and securing his six
shooter opened fire on Burns as the latter
entered the door. The first bullet killed
the gun fighter.
Burns was unpopular with the cowboys
in the San Pedro country. He was feared
because it was known that he was a crack
shot and fearless. He had engaged in a
number of shooting scrapes In which he
always came out without' a scratch.
Filed upon his six-shooter were thirteen
notches, which meant that that many
men had been killed by him.
Buried With. His Boots On.
. The, body jras.saeo hx.the Corpnejuand.
an inquest was held.^'^VaHac<8^(ras!*^xon- ;
erated and' Burns'" body 'was given over
to the cowboys employed at the "Willis
ranch for burial. On the way to the spot
selected for Interment the cowboys jumped
upon the box coffin and danced, shouting,
"We'll dance him into hell."
Bums was buried as he died, with his
boots on. To be buried in boots is re
garded as a worse fate than death- itself
by cow-punchers. The punchers kicked
their epurs into the side of .the 'coffin -as
they rode on the top of the bcx to the
grave, showing the disrespect Â¦ which
they held for Burns, * - . .. }]
A few years ago Burns engaged in a
shooting scrape I with a Mexican, desper
ado known , as . Gaibee , at Mammoth.'
Burns was behind the bar In a saloon,'
the bartender having urged him to take
the place, as' Gaibee was in camp and
there was s^ure to be trouble. Upon enter
ing the saloon Gaibee at* once recognized
Burns and, pulling off his sombrero, held
It in close to his body and walked toward
the bar. Gaibee had slyly pulled his six
shooter and held it behind the â¢sombrero.'
Hurns thought Gaibee was after him and
pulling his gun opened fire. Gaibee was
shot several times, but lying on the floor
of the saloon cleaned out the place. He
recovered and the cowboys believed that
Burns 'had taken an unfair advantage of
Gaibee, which turned them against him.
Chased Evans and Sonntag.
Burns for years was employed as a shot
gun messenger for "Wells-Fargo and did
a great deal of detective work among the
desperadoes of the Southwest. He was
regarded as a fearless man and would
tackle the hardest characters in the coun
try. Seven years ago, when the Southern
Pacific express was held up and robbed
near Fresno, Cal., Burns was sent on the
trail of the robbers with a posse. It was
through his efforts that the robbers were
captured. Burns was one of the men who
shot Sontag, one of the robbers. Evans,
the partner of Sontag. is serving his sen
tence at Folsom.
When the reward money was divided
there was shooting between Burns and a
man named Wittey. Both men fired, but
neither was hit. and the fight created
some eensation at the time.
Returning to. Arizona Burns was en
gaged in running down cattle rustlers. He
followed a horse thief from Florence, in
Arizona, 'to New Mexico and killed him,
bringing back the horse to its owner. He
was engaged whenever any desperate
work was reauired. because he did not
know fear. On the border he engraved in
m3ny shooting scrapes, with rustlers and
smugglers, the last one having occurred
but two years ago. During 3 the past year
Burns had been punching cows in Tonto
Basin and the San Pedro country. He
was about 40 years old and a good type of
the cowboy. He was known 'all over "Ari
zona, and his fate Is regarded as the in
evitable result of the life he led. At Will -
cox Burt Alvord, who Is now' a fugitive
from justice, attempted to kill Burns,
who was then securing evidence" against
the gang which held up the Southern Pa
cific at Cochise over a year ago. Alvord
was a member of the hold-up gang, al
though at the time he was serving as a
corstable at Willcox.

GONZALES, Tex., June 20.â A dispatch
has been received from Deputy United
States Marshal William Hansen, stating
that one of the slayers of Sheriff Glover
has been captured and one killed, and
that a posse of five officers is close on the
trail of Gregorio Cottez. This is probably
a confirmation of yesterday's report.
Rangers and officers continue to scour the
country in the neighborhood of Alice. San
Diego and Benavides in search of the
Mexicans suspected of murder. Late last
evening Marshal Noland received infor
mation that the rangers had killed a Mex
ican near Venavides, who resisted arrest.
Officers here are of the opinion that the
dead man belongs to one of the gangs
war.ted for killine Sheriff Glover.

DETTMARK MUST SELL

Demand Contained in a Note Sent
by the United States
Government.
LONDON, June 20.â The Copenhagen
correspondent of the Daily Mail cables his
paper saying that the United States has
sent another note to Denmark in the mat
ter of the sale of the Danish West Indies,
to the effect that If Denmark is not will
ing to sell the Islands the United Statea
must demand that Denmark fortify and
garrison the islands of St. Thomas and
St. John, which would command the Xic
aragua canal.
The situation is regarded seriously here,
as Denmark cannot dream of undertaking
the erection of fortifications and the
maintenance of garrisons, which would
cost several millions.

ALfTURAfi, June 19.â A fresh sensation
excited the people of Alturas last night
Â¦when It 'was learned that Mrs. Perry
Summers of Lookout had given damaging
testimony- before the Grand Jury regard-
Ing the Lookout lynching. ....
Mrs. Summers was heard to say at the
Grand Central Hotel this morning that
the testimony she had given before the
Grand Jury yesterday would compel her
to leave Lookout In order to save her life.
It afterward became known that she had
testified that on the night of the lynch
ing she heard the movements of the mob,
got out of bed, followed the lynchers to
the bridge and there witnessed the whole
affair unseen by any one. She asserted
that she at first thought it was a joke
and wished to see the outcome. She also
declared that she- identified several of the
mob and can swear to their identity.
Several of the Lookout witnesses said
to-day that the woman's statements are
not true. It is said that she has sat up
for several nights since the lynching,
armed with a pistol, for fear she would
be mobbed because of her knowledge of
the affair.
The Grand Jury will probably adjourn
to-night. All the witnesses have been ex
cused and have gone home. It Is thought
by a l2rge number here that no less than
six indictments will be found... Nothing
definite csn be learned regarding, the. In
dian scare at Lookout, but as all the wit
nesses have departed from here there will
probably be no danger from the redskins.

There was a riot of soldiers in the town
this evening, caused by the arrest of two
soldiers, one from the First Infantry and
one from the Seventh. The men were ar
rested for" disorderly conduct and were
placed In the town jail.. The word was
passed among the soldiers in town and
soon there was a crowd of one hundred or
more outside the Jail, talking and threat
ening. It began to look serious until the
Sheriff telephoned to the camp for assist
ance and In a short time a troop of cav
alry galloped up the street- -
_ The two prisoners were turned over to
the troopers and the soldiers thought they
had scored a victory. , .They were cheer
ing lustily when General Dicklnlson rode
up with two of his staff. The general
threatened to order the "long roll" if the
cheering was not stopped at once and to
arrest every man in the crowd, so the men
became silent. ..Then.the cavalrymen sur
rounded them and drove them in a bunch
out to the camp.
Capture of Staff Officer.
i Colonel Bangham. assistant adjutant
general on the Governor's staff, went out
reconnoiterirg for the First Brigade this
morning and cam* to grief in conse
quence. The First Brigade has for its
principal organization the Seventh Regi-,
ment. which comes from Los Angeles and
jts vicinity, and from Los Angeles comes
Colonel Bangham. He therefore thought
he would fall among friends until he
struck one of the outposts that made him
a prisoner. He thought It was a good
joke until he tried to break arrest, and
then he learned that his captors did real
ly intend to take him into the brigade
headquarters as a prisoner or a prize of
war. He was taken to the guard tent
ar.d there the officer of the guard believed
his protestations of peace and unwilling
ness to harm the command, so he was let
go en parole. Then he rode back Into
camp and reported his capture.
Tills afternoon at 3 o'clock the Second
It was all done on the run and inside
cf fifteen minutes the troops were all in
position and the guns had commenced fir
ing. The cams was unprepared for the
call and the result was a good indication
of what the few days' drill has done for
thp troops. When the defending troops
had been withdrawn and General Last
had approached the camp, he sent his aid.
Captain Bauer, forward to tender . a re
view of the brigade to General Dickin
son. General Dickinson sent word he
would review the troops on the parade
ground, and he and his staff were out on
the hill when Last's brigade marched up
the road and formed in line of massed
battalions on the ridge. The men had
been over a march of nine miles, but they
returned in excellent condition and swung
past the commanding general with the
fctep of veterans.
The brigade had camped near the Big
Trees and in the vicinity of the Felton
road. The detachment of the signal corps

"No;'I will dimply attend to the Union

as occasion required.
â¢ He 'did not return home last night, and
on investigation he was found dead at the
ranch house. ; The following note, evi

found on the floor, by his side,:
I ' have taken a heaping teaspoonful of
strychnine. After waiting 13 minutes I feel
no ill effects. I have no fear. I am calmly
waiting the pangs of dissolution. But they
do not come. I would smoke a cigarette If I
had one.' This is the most interesting time I
have ever had. I am beginning to feel sick.
At times my head is giddy. I am able to live,

has Just given us a picture of the iprogress
made by our fatherland In the domain of
aquatic sport. \ My whole task in the future
will be- to assure that the seeds now sown
enall spring up In peace and security. Not
withstanding â¢ the fact that we as yet havÂ»
not a navy as we should have, we have won
for ourselves a place In the sunshine and It
will now be my task to take care this place
remains In. our undisputed possession, so that
the sun's rays may- shed fruitful influence
over our. trade and Intercourse abroad and In

the German has learned to keep an eye on
the far horizon the pettiness surrounding him
in his daily life disappears. If a man. wants
to get this broad and higher view, a Hansattc
tour is surely the most suitable for him. We
have drawn our conclusions from what Em
peror William the Great and the great man
whose monument . we have Just unveiled have
left us. Those . conclusions consist . In this â
that s we start 'at the point at which the old
Hansa has to leave off, because it lacked the

profound peace, to promote and protect trade

that our new Hansa will mark out a path frr

rejoice over every Hansatlc man who - roes

where we can knock in nails on which to hang

IMMEDIATE PLANS
OF CONGRESSMEN
The Oakland committee left no chance
for the needs of the communities across
the bay to be misunderstood. They hand
ed to each member of the Rivers and Har
bors Committee a carefully prepared doc
ument which Â«5et forth that the total ton
nage of freight passing through the jetty
channel of Oakland harbor in one year,
not including Long "Wharf,- amounted to
3,373,112 tons. The requests that will be
urged at Washington for harbor better
ments were al3O enumerated. - .
During the day several important com
munications were presented to the atten
tion of the Committee on Rivers and Har
bors, which had been received from promi
nent shipping men. One of these was
written by Captain W. E. Mighell. This
inclosed a list of twenty-six vessels man
aged by Mighell which arc unable to go
to the Oakland wharves and also had a
suggestion that a depth of twenty-five feet
at mean low tide should be secured in
Oakland harbor. Hind, Rolph & Co.,
shipping men, wrote that, they have sev
eral steamers bringing coal from Van
couver Island. B. C, which are unable to
discharge in Oakland because of the lack
of deep water. They stated that this
means an extra charge of 50 cents per ton
for coal against Oakland. â¢ John Rosen
feld's Sons wrote that their coal vessels
draw twenty-five feet .when laden and
none of the larger ones can be sent into
Â¦Oakland harbor to. discharge at tho
Â¦wharves. Letters of similar import were
received from H. J. Knowles, - Williams,
Dlmond & Co. and H. S. Jerome.
FACTS SUPPLIED

The party disembarked at Adams' wharf:
rode through Oakland, the drive Including
a visit to the handsome grounds of F. M.
Smith; then proceeded to luncheon. After
luncheon, the ladles were taken In car
riages under the direction of . Secretary
Charles F. Cole of the Oakland joint com
mittee and saw many sections of Oak
land not previously viewed by them.
The gentlemen proceeded to Adams' wharf
and embarked in a launch and two small
vachts, which were towed by the launch,
and went up to the High-street bridge,
passing through the tidal basin. Once
more they took carriages and went around
to the junction of U.e tidal canal with
San Leandro Bay and then drove through
Alameda and Oakland back to Adams'
wharf. There they embarked on the Slo
cum once more and steamed back to San
Francisco, passing around the battleships
on the bay in passage and cheering and
being cheered by the crew of the battle
ship Oregon. ;
Throughout the trip Chairman Burton
stood near the pilot-house with maps in
hand, vigorously asking questions. With
him were Senator Perkins, Congressman
Metcalf, Colonel Heuer, "W. A. Boole Jr.
of. Oakland, James A. Taylor, James de
Fremery, Congressman Bankhead, Wil
liam M. Bunker and Secretary Scott of
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce. Mr. Burton had his stenographer
near and to him many observations were

in sociability, the greater part of the day
was spent in business. The Rivers and

REPRESENTATIVES OF THREE CITIES,
Barker and his wife were upon the
stand to-day. They told their story, so
far as the court would allow, answering
the questions of counsel for the defense,
and, althourh the record does not show
It. Mr. Van Winkle got reference to Rev.
Mr. Keller's alleged insult to Mrs. Bar
ker before tha Jury In one way and an
other, though the nature of the act was
not brought out. :
The purpose of Barker's testimony was
to show that, after having brooded for
a period over what his wife had told him.
he was in a morbid state of mind, and
when he came face to" face with the min
ister he was carried away by feeling and
began firing; that it was sudden, violent
and temporary Insanity, lasting but a
moment, but long enough to cover the
period of the shooting.
Barker admitted that he bought the re
volver at the time he had heard the story
which worried him and caused him sleep
less nights and great mental stress. He
denied, however, that he bought it for the
purpose of shooting' the clergyman. â¢
Mrs. Barker was a little nervous at first
but this finally wore off. She calmly an
swered the Questions of her husband's
lawyers and by the time she was put
under cross-examination appeared to be
under perfect self-control.
NEW YORK, June 19.â The fate of
Thomas G. Barker, on trial at Jersey City
for the shooting and wounding of Rev.
John Keller, may go to the Jury to-mor
row. The defense had practically finished
when the court arose this evening.

Ma.iL "readv to keep order and eject the
malcontents. The 'stalwarts' were drawn
from the low class foreign clubs In Soho.
Many of them were armed with sticks,
broomhandles and knuckle dusters, and
they acted with unrestrained violence in
excluding rowdies and throwing out un
desirable persons."
A. J. Balfour, First Lord of the Treas
ury, in a speech to-night at a. Conserva-,
tlve banquet in London, made a strong
protest against the action of the Banner
man party in countenancing the pro-Boer
movement, thereby prolonging the war
and adding to the already great difficulties
and sufferings.
"It is a scandalous arid shocking thing."
said Mr. Balfour, "that such men should,
before the whole worlS. accuse their fel
low countrymen and soldiers of carrying
on war by barbarous methods."
LOICDOX, Juna 13.â Thousands of peo
ple began collecting outside of Queen's I
Kail two hours before the advertised time
of the pro-Boer meeting held there to
night. "When the doors Were finally
opened the pressure of the surging mob
was so great that many pepolo fainted.
There vraa considerable disturbance and
windows were broken in during the at
tempts made by persons without tickets
to gala admission. Some of these were
Injured.
l>uring the disturbance many Jingoes
salued admittance to the hall, which was
crammed from floor to ceiling. Much
hooting, mingled with cheers, greeted tho
delegates upon their arrival, and, during
the evening: the delivery of speeches was
attended by some difficulty from the
same cause.
Henry Lahouchere presided at the meet
ing, and besides J. "W. Sauer, ex-Commis
sioner of Public Works of Cape Colony,
many prominent pro-Boers. Including
John Dillon, leader of the Nationalists;
David Lloyd-George (Welsh Nationalist)
and James Kerr Hardle (Socialist) were
present.
During the meeting fully 10,000 Jingoes
gathered outside the hall, blockaded traf
fic and necessitated relays of policemen
to keep a, semblance of order In the
crowd. Several men mounted the para
pet cJ the Langham Hotels and, waving
union jacks, proposed resolutions against
the pro-Boer agitation, which they de
clared to have been carried when the
meeting in Queen's Hall terminated.
The usual speeches were made and the
usual resolutions were carried amid much
commotion and excitement- The resolu
tions included an amendment In favor of
the complete independence of the Boer
republics, proposed by Baron Batterse, for
the Radicals, which did not meet the ap
proval of the Labouchere party. The
meeting ended with the singing of the
"Marseillaise."
J. X. Merriman, ex-Treasurer of Cape
Colony and now a representative of the
Afrikander Bund In England, wrote a
letter to the promoters of the meeting,
apologizing for his absence.
Several collisions occurred between the
crowd outside the hall and the police, and
the latter had the greatest difficulty la
handling the assemblage. No casualties
â¢were reported.
The Daily Mall asserts that the pro
moters of the Queen's Hall meeting pro
cured the services of six or seven hun
dred "stalwarts" as stewards. These
"gangs of foreign ruffians" were found
inside the hall, according to the Daily
Jingoes Interrupt Speakers

said she was willing to obey, the law, but
tearfully explained that she and her little

DENVER, June 19.â Mrs. N. H. Cone-

ready discarded the name Â¦ of her latest
but not lamented husbandâ has returned
to Denver and will obtain a decree of di
vorce as soon as the wheels of Justice In.
the County Court can be made to move.
Mrs. Cone has not returned to her Denver
home, but has engaged a suit of rooms at
-the Brown Palace. She has spent the time
in New York since her sudden departure
from the Golden Gate city, and Just, to
pass away the tedious hours is said to
have dabbled a little in stocks. She is
reported to have cleared 512,000 in North

But Mrs. Cone does not need to specu
late. She has informed friends since her
return that her income is $800 a month.
Apparently she no longer grieves over her
third matrimonial venture, for during the
past few nights she has been the center
of a gay crowd of young clubmen on the
balconies at the Brown, and her stunning
Parisian gowns have been the talk of the
house. Mrs. Cone is more than pretty:
she is of that type that is called dashing.

interests at Cripple Creek. He died In
Denver a little more than a- year ago,

should be understood that tonics, electricity,
etc., might cure a real weakness, but would do
harm in Inflammation. The main object Is to
reduce the size of the tender, swollen and In-

Commission agrees to give them the use
of the slip and sheds for. fifty-eight

they are to revert to the State. This - is

THE freight. transport Aztec arrived
from Manila early yesterday
morning. She left the Philippines
in company with the Buford and
they arrived at Nagasaki to
gether. Both sailed for San Francisco on
May 26, but on' June 8 the Buford found
she could not make any headway with
the coal she had In her bunkers, so Cap
tain Merkens decided to put into Hono
lulu for a fresh supply.
The Aztec made the run in thirty-two
days and her machinery is in such per
fect condition that she could go out again
to-morrow if necessary. The chances are
that all her United States stores will be
taken out of her at once and she will be
turned over to her owners. In that event
the mail company -will probably put her
in the Oriental run.
The Aztec brought over 146 passengers
all told. Among them were seven cabin
passengers, eight discharged men, eleven
deported men. Company H of the Forty
seventh infantry and a number of civilian
employes of the Government. Among the
deported men were five stowaways.. They
managed to get to Manila on the Ohio
but were promptly sent back on the Az
tec. Among them was a 14-year-old lad
named Kdward O'Neill. The names of the
others are- J. Reynolds, F. Rugby, Joe
Sullivan and Bill Joe. They were put
ashore as soon as the transport docked
yesterday.' '' ~ Â¦' i ' 'v. :' V^.r? :

All the volunteers will be home before
June 26. The Thomas, with part of the
Thirty-eighth and Forty-ninth regiments
and all of the Forty-seventh Infantry, is
expected next Saturday. The Ohio, with
the Forty-second Infantry, should get in
next Sunday. The Buford, according to
her captain's calculations, should get here
with the Forty-first infantry on the 24th
inst. The Indiana, with part of the Forty
second; Logan, with part of the Thirty

BUSY . TIMES IN . ALIi
THE TRAINING QUAETEBS
Moffatt, Gardner, , Neill and . Others
Preparing for Coming
. . ( Contests. . '.
The four gladiators who are to battle in
the arena at Sixteenth and Folsom streets
on the afternoon of July 4 under the
auspices of the San Francisco Athletic
Club are now fit to fight for a kingdom.
For the last two weeks the training quar
ters of Jack Moffatt at the Seal , Rock
House, the quarters of George Gardner
and _ Charles Thurston at the Ingleside
House and those of Al Neill at the Ter
minal have been the scene of much ac
tivity and hard work.
â¢ Jack Moffatt, the clever Chicago middle
weight, Is working faithfully for his com
ing bout with Gardner. His work is cut
out for him each day, and the manner In
which he goes about his task shows that
he enjoys it. He rises each morning at
6:30 and takes a stroll down the beach to
fill his lungs with ozone." On his return to
the Seal Rock House he sits down to
breakfast and eats as an athlete will
when In training. He afterward ' lolls
around for a few hours and then dons his
heavy sweater and shoes and tramps and
runs over the hills. He covers eight miles
each day, and on returning to his quarters
is given a brisk rub. He then has his
lunch, and at 2 o'clock enters the gym
nasium for the hard work of the day. He
punches the bag for five, five-minute
rounds and then boxes with Dukelow, his
sparring partner. He next skips the rope
a few thousand times and is then rubbed
again. This -finishes the work of the day
and he retires to rest at 9 p.m.
Moffatt is showing the effects of this
work and is in splendid shape. Gardner
is working- with "Dutch" Thurston and
Willie Snallham at the Ingleside House.
He boxes with Dave Barry, Thurston and
others and says he is in great shape.
Thurston is a glutton^ for work. He never
eeems to tire, and J the way he punches
Alec Greggalns 'would lead any one to
Â¦believe â¢ that the receiver could not enjoy
himself. ' Greggains protects himself with
an inflated cushion. .
Al Nelll its working at the Terminal. He
â¢admits being in great shape and says he
will win. He boxes with Toby Irwln.
Tim Hegarty, the Australian, Is work
ing at the same place. He is to box Tim
Callahan on the evening of the 28th be
fore the Twentieth Century Club. Jack
Root and "Kid" Carter will go twenty
rounds the same nigrht.

It is a wonderful soap
that takes hold quick and
does no harm.
No harm ! It leaves the
skin soft like a baby's; no
alkali in it, nothing but
soap. The harm is done by
alkali. Still more harm is
- done by not washing-. So,
, bad soap is better than
none.
What is bad soap? Im-
perfectly made; the fat
and alkali not: well bal-

LY ELECTED GRAND SECRE
TARY OF THE DRUIDESSES.
AT the second session of the Grand
Grove of California, United An
cient Order of Druids, yester
day the recommendation of the
noble grand arch that $40 a
Quarter be allowed to the widow of F.
Eieg. the first noble grand arch of the
order, was adopted. Mrs. Sieg, who Is
now BS years of age. is a guest at the Old
Ladies' Home, which she entered a num
ber of years a^o, at which time the Grand
Grove adopted her as its ward, providing
her with many things for her comfort.
Recently she became totally blind, and
being helpless the grand body decided to
erant her the sum named 16 pay for a
nurse.
It was decided to designate May 6 of
each vear as Druids day, to be observed
by the various groves either by a picnic
cr a bancuet.
The offer of Dr. C. CL O'Donnell to do
nate fifteen acres of land in Glen Ellen
for a Druids' Home was accepted, the
donor agreeing to pay for the survey and
abstract of title.
L. A. Wolff, publisher of the Druids'
Magazine, the official organ, was allowed
$500 for the year as a bonus for continu
ing the publication.
The committee on Galveston sufferers
reported having sent $240 for the relief of
Buffering Druids in that city.
The salary of Grand Secretary Graves
was Increased ?25 per month in conse
quence of increased duties.
The grand body authorized the organi
zation of juvenile groves and fixed the
age of applicants for membership at 12 to
IS. IJpon attaining the maximum age the
young Druids are to be transferred to se
nior proves.
The appeal case of Cordoza against Hes
perSan Grove was reopened to admit of
the Introduction of additional testimony.

o'clock this morning. The lire was pre
ceded by an explosion, in which the com
pany s private i watchman Is supposed to
have lost his life. The explosion was a
terrific one. shaking the buildings for
blocks around. The concern is one of the
largest of the land in the West

DENVER, June 19.â The Times to-day
says: A gigantic scheme Is under way to
transfer the railroads of the United States
to the Government. A financier who has
just returned from the East, where he in
vestigated the rumors afloat in financial
circles, asserts that the reports of im
pending Government ownership are gen
eral. He declared that within a few years
the Rockefeller, Harrlman, Vanderbilt,
Gould and Morgan interests would turn
over to the Government, every line in the
United States, to the total value of about
ten billion dollars andW string of banks
controlled by the same Interests to finance
the deal.' Â¦

Â£L DORADO, Kans.. June 19.â After
only, two days of testimony the State, in
the case of Jessie Morrison, on trial for
the murder of Mrs. Olin Castle, rested
this afternoon. The defense will, it is
said, spring a surprise in the introduction
of new evidence not adduced at the first
trial. When Miss Morrison took the stand
in December last to tell in her own de
fense of the- fatal quarrel with her rival,
she testified that Mrs. Castle had called
her to the house and started the trouble.
At that time an affidavit of A. J. Morgan,
a peddler, who swore that he heard Mrs.
Castle rap on the' door as Miss Morrison
was passing her house and call her in.
Â¦was presented. Morgan could not be
found, but it is now stated the defen8e
has located him and will put him on the
stand. Other new witnesses may be In
troduced by the defense to sustain the
plea of self-defense.

The employment of wireless telegraphy will render great
services. Its stationary uses include communications between
the coast and lightships or lighthouses Isolated at sea and
communications between Islands apa the coast.
In the former case wireless telegraphy will serve to extend
considerably the semaphore service of port3. Lightships float-
Ing outside the harbors can, by its agency, bo kept in constant
and certain communication with the port In. all weathers and
can signal the arrival of passing ships a long time In advance.
This has already been done at Bremen, where a lightship fitted
with wireless telegraphy apparatus is rendering excellent serv
ice as an advanced semaphore.
The Herald's wireless station, to bo placed on the Nan
tucket Lighthouse, will report ocean liners from ten to fifteen
hours before they arrive off New York harbor.
"When wireless telegraphy stations have been, established
fn all parts of the world ships at sea fitted up with the Mar
coni apparatus will In most cases be able to communicate
with the mainland. ' This will give an Impetus to navigation
and greatly reduce maritime risks. Vessels provided with
wireless telegraphy apparatus will be able to ask for succor
from land either for themselves or for oth.er vessels In distress
which they are unable to relieve.
The conclusive and continuous experiments with wireless
telegraphy conducted during several weeks past between
Antlbes and Calvl Justify the hope that France and Corsica
will shortly be placed permanently In communication by means
of this marvelous system.â Paris Edition of New York Herald.
EXPERIMENTS are being made at Antlbes with the
Marconi system. "Wireless telegraphy has already been
successfully operated between France and Corsica, The
municipal administration of Antlbes has done every
thing possible to further the experiments, which are under the
direction of M. de Bremaecker, engineer.
Professor Branley of the Paris Catholic faculty, while In
vestigating the electrical resistance of metallic filings, discov
ered that this resistance, which is ordinarily very great, dimin
ishes to an enormous extent when the filings are acted upon
by the electric oscillations known as the Hertzian waves, after
the -name of Hertz, their discoverer. Professor Branley's dis
covery rendered wireless telegraphy possible, as It furnished
the means of receiving electric oscillations at a distance. "With
the aid of Professor Branley's discovery Mr. Marconi discov
ered the wireless telegraphy system, says the Monde Illustre.
For the purpose of operating the wireless telegraphy * sys
tem between France and Corsica stations have been established
at Calvi and at Antibes. The Antibes station is situated near
the Blot Railway. The. only apparatus In the open air is the
mast and crosspiece supporting the vertical wire. The mast
supporting the coherer apparatus consists of three parts re
spectively 26, 18 and 17 meters long.
Excellent results have always been obtained during the
experiments with wireless telegraphy between Antlbes and
Calvl. The distance between the stations is 175 kilometers
(108.5 miles). This Is not the greatest distance over which the
Marconi wireless telegraphy system has been operated. Com

RAPID IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIRELESS
TELEGRAPHY BY MARCONI'S MARVELOUS SYSTEM
An event which, the .bureau considers of sufficient
importance to be noted in its bearing upon the inter
nal commerce of the country during April is the ship
ment of a carload of Valencia oranges from Southern
California to Portland, Or., destined for Vladivostok,
Siberia." In commenting, upon it the report of the
Bureau of Statistics says: "This is the first fruit ship
ment'of the kind, and illustrates the tendency in this
branch of -production to relieve itself from the neces
sity of depending solely on the domestic and Euro
pean markets. The failure of California orange
growers to find a sufficient supply of cars to enable
In Southern territory the cotton movement is the
most important, 9,384,947 bales having come into
sight.by May 1, 1901. Of this amount Texas alone
contributed 3,508,499 bales. The growth of New Or
leans as a grain port is seen in the fact that .there were
exported from that city during the four months end
ing May 1 18,022,363 bushels of grain, as compared
with 14,153,127 bushels in the four months of. 1900.
The commercial movements at "the Atlantic sea
board include grain and flour. During April, 1901,
Boston received 4,092,892 bushels; New York, 9,655,
919 bushels; Philadelphia, 4,931,597 bushels, and Bal
timore,' 6,313,254 bushels, making a total of 24,993,662
bushels for those four principal ports.
The increase of trade in the Mississippi Valley has
been mainly in the way of livestock and cereals. The
livestock receipts at the five principal markets* of
Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, St. .Louis and St. Jo
seph during 1901 show remarkable gains over last
year, both as regards April and the four months end
ing with April, the official receipts of cattle, hogs and
sheep ia the four months just ended showing an in
crease of. 359,417 head, as compared with the corre
sponding four months of 1900. The receipts of spring
and winter wheat at the eight markets of Minneapolis,
Milwaukee, Duluth, Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis,
Detroit and Toledo for the harvest year to April 30
were 10,840,722 bushels more than a year, ago, a gain
of approximately 6 per cent. .
FOR some time past the Treasury Bureau of
Statistics has been engaged in compiling statis
tics showing the leading movements in the *do
mestic trade of the country. A recently published
summary of the work in that regard contains over a
hundred tables giving figures of traffic along the At
lantic seaboard, the Great Lakes, the South and the
Pacific Coast. Among the interesting features of the
showing made by the ,tables is that of the widening
scope of internal commerce, caused by the conversion
of vacant lands into farms in the Northwest and min
eral developments in the Southwest, which sections
are enjoying a large influx* of hospitality.
COMMERCIAL MOVEMENTS.
It is not easy to explain the unsettled condition of
the weather all over the United States this summer,
but it" is worth noting that the Legislatures of Penn
sylvania and of Massachusetts have not adjourned yet
and in those centers the air is still subject to erratic
disturbances. . " ~
It was not intended to be a paternal scheme, and
therefore was not made fit for the conduct of busi
ness.
No one can plan in advance the changes that must
be made to fit such a scheme for paternal administra
tion. We only knotv that wherever the attempt has
been made waste has" resulted, causing a loss to the
people that is greater than the profit of corporate
energy in the same field of administration. ' The his
tory of such experiments by no means justifies the
rosy prospectus issued by the advocates of. municipal
paternalism. It is believed by many thinkers that
such paternalism in its cost and tyranny would ex
ceed anything charged now against the so-called cap
italistic system, and that if there is to be a change
it should not be to the incurably inefficient system of
municipal administration with its division- of respon
sibility and inevitable waste.
Municipal paternalism, the administration of utili
ties under public o\vnershipÂ» makes necessary a divi
sion of responsibility, and that is the final cause of
weakness, inefficiency end expense of administration.
In even' case in which inquiry has been made it has
been shown that municipal accounts are not kept so
that the cost of service in the case of municipal pa
ternal administration of gas, water or railway plants
can be ascertained. In many cases the proponents
and the opponents of municipal paternalism have
joined in trying to reform municipal accounting so
that cost of service can be known, but their attempts
have failed. In Chicago and New York it is impos
sible to find out the cost of municipal paternalism in
the water supply. The cost is divided among inter
est, construction, maintenance and profit and loss ac
counts, and each is so imperfectly' kept that experts
employed by commercial bodies have reported the as
certainment of cost to be impossible.
It is admitted by proponents and opponents of
municipal paternalism that if a uniform system of ac
counting, furnished and audited by the Government,
were adopted by all municipalities and all private
corporations it would disclose the administrative abil
ity of each, and that, under equal physical conditions,
it would probably demonstrate that municipal waste
is greater than corporate profit, because responsibility
is more divided in a municipality than in a private
corporation.
In administering any great American railway there
is a concentration of tesponsibility, and that rule runs
throughout all business operations. In the formation
of government, for the discharge of its proper poli
tical functions, there is, on the other hand, a division
of responsibility. Our scheme of government is
based on that principle, and hence we have the three
co-ordinate branches dividing responsibility among
them. ,
THERE is no evidence that the municipal pater
nalism which is imported into this country from
Europe will be sny more satisfactory to Ameri
cans than personal paternalism. There have been
many examples here of the failure of personal or cor
porate paternalism. TKe Pullman Company and other
large employers of labor have housed it comfortably,'
established schools, provided baths and even amuse
ments, only to find that these paternal arrangements
do not produce contentment nor happiness in their
We have endeavored to inquire, in a spirit of in
vestigation, into the results of municipal paternalism
!in the United States, and so far none of the advocates
of that system have satisfactorily answered the ques
tions, the proper answer to which must determine the
wisdom of the policy. We do not decide that it will
be unwise. We simply wait proof that it will be wise.

The rank, and file, upon whom Mr. Cleveland seems
to rely as the party's forlorn' hope, seem to be too
busy or. too paralyzed by two defeats under Mr.
Bryan to express an opinion. They know they have
been hurt by obeying orders in two campaigns.
Their general in command has flung them against in
vincible artillery. The infantry has made cavalry
charges, and the cavalry has. made infantry charges,
and. both have been mowed down. ( They feel

if they can reason why, with sufficient clearness to
put the blame where it belongs/ â¢ <
Meantime the Republican statesmen are watching
the Bryanites much as a housewife watches a cat in a
fit, wondering what it will do next.
Tillman of South Carolina holds a close second to

several sources of Democratic opinion.

Stone is a warm member, and can supply metaphor
and hyperbole, he-hysterics and political flapdoodle
enough for the next four national conventions.
The political element heretofore and now in power
in the South loves extremes. They are suited to the
Southern temper. CaJhoun andYancey, Toombs and
Jefferson Davis, are still the Southern ideals, though
the extreme, policies for which they stood have never
turned a wheel, made a dollar or produced two bales
of cotton where one grew before. The business men
of the South have never been influential in politics.
The men of leisure have always been the leaders there.
A change is brewing in that section, but there are
grave 4 ou bts whether it will make an impression
deep enough to control the Southern delegations.
Missouri, if Governor Stone speaks for the State,
is Damon to Bryan's Pythias. Stone has delivered an
interview in which he stands hovering that "young

an internecine strife. The outs in Southern Democracy
are against the ins, and are allying â¢ themselves with
the industrial and commercial conditions with which
Senator McLaurin and ex- Senator Caffery aro
aligned.
Pennsylvania -Democrats say that an 'exponent^of
conservatism will be nominated next time, and Bryan
will have but little influence.
In his own State there appears a rather determined
opposition to him, which is ascribed to the influence
of J. Sterling -Morton and other Gold Democrats.
Personally no man exceeds Morton in influence in
Nebraska. In that State there seems, to be a growing
feeling that Mr. Bryan's two candidacies were really
brought about by Republican, influence. He was

man to beat. -Be this as it may, Nebraska seems to
have wearied of his extreme position:
To determine the 'probable value of his influence
the Herald has taken interviews with the local lead
ers of his party.in all sections of the country. New
England is found to be most contented with his dic
tatorship. Everywhere there "is apparent the same
subjection to his will that made the Kansas City con
vention subservient to. him. But this may mean let
ting him down easy, since but few seem willing to
accept him again as a candidate.
BRYAN'S POTENCY.
THE -New-York Herald says that President Mc-

FOR HONEST PRIMARIES.
BY the character of the men. selected to act as
an advisory committee the Republican Pri
fmary. League has given assurance to the rank
and file of the party that its object is not to further
the ambitions of particular candidates, or to assist in
any factional attempt to control the nominating con
vention, but to promote genuine Republicanism and
to assure honest primary elections under the new law
of the State. -
The members of the advisory committee are not
unknown. They stand for something in business, in
professional life 1 and in politics. They are men of
influence and of known integrity. No one doubts the
Republicanism of any member of the committee, nor
will it be denied that they^ will uphold the best tra
ditions of the party against the domination of bosses
and their tools. v -
So important is the personality, of the committee ,
at this juncture that it will be well for .'all citizens to
read over the list and see what kind of men have been
called to the leadership in the movement. ; Here it is:

Brooks, George A. Moore, T. W. Collins, C. B. Rode,
Frank J. Symmes. . > \ . '
As an advisory committee these men will be heard
in every important step taken in the work of the
league, and the course taken in any instance 'will be
largely determined and guided by their counsel. It is
hardly necessary to say that under their guidance the
organization will never become a faction or a clique, v
nor will it ever have any oth'er objects than those
of promoting Republicanism and maintaining honest
primaries. *
These things having been assured by the selection
of an advisory committee in which Republicans can
have well founded confidence, there can be no longer
any reason why all genuine Republicans should not
join the association or co-operate with it. There has
long been a demand for a primary law, and the de
mand has now been complied with. The' law. is upon
the statute-books. It cannot, however, enforce itself,
nor can it of its own vigor overthrow boss rule. If
the better elements of the Republican party do not
'take an interest in the primaries and attend the elec
tions, the* bosses will once more control the nominat
ing conventions. \ \ , Â¦ >: â¢
As the matter now stands the issue is up to the
rank and file of the Republican party. The origin
ators of the league have pledged themselves so to ex
tend and develop, it that all who are members of , the
party and who desire to do so may connect themselves
with it. It is in no way exclusive, and is subject to
the absolute control of its members.- There is^here a
chance for every Republican to serve his party and
the city, and it should not be lost.
GLASS AND AIR.
MOST men of our time are fully persuaded that
the present century is destined to be known
as the age of steel and of electricity; that the
one will be used more and more for structural pur
poses and the other for motive power. There are,
however, riot lacking people who dissent from the
common opinion. Men of good authority as .experts
maintain that glass will be more used for structural
purposes than steel, and that the power, which will
drive the engines of the future, whether stationary or
locomotive, will be not so much electricity as com
pressed air. l
It is not to be understood that the believers in
glass and air hold a belief that we shall make no use
at all of steel and electricity. They admit readily
enough that there will be some purposes for which
those things will be far better than any other that
can be offered, just as there will always be some struck
tures for. which wood is better than metal or brick,
and some. forms of traction 'for which horse power
will be better. $han any engine. Nevertheless" they
insist that the great mass of materialised in the
structures of- the future will be glass, and the dom
inant motive power will be compressed air.
: The arguments for compressed air as a competitor
against electricity are fairly well known, for they have
been frequently stated by the; manufacturers of en
gines driven 'by that power. The glass men have of
late been making claims equally strong. It is argued
that there is an inexhaustible supply of material for
making glass and that the manufacture of.it is be
coming every year more economical. A noted glass
manufacturer of France is quoted as saying recently:
It is obvious that glass can be shaped, colored and
decorated to an extent of which no other vmaterial is
capable. ' Chairs and tables, in the new glass age, will
be made" of, vitrified material, toughe^dto the strength
of teak and mahogany. Cooking .utensils, plates and
cups and saucers will be made of the same, substance.
The new glass house will be absolutely^ clean and.prac
tically indestructible.. The whole "of its 'surface can be
washed from the top story to the, basement without a
trace of the humidity being left. Dust cannot collect on
the polished face, and the spider will find no place on
which to hang 1 Its cobwebs. .â¢'Â¦"
We are thus to look forward to an age when there
will be an acute rivalry between electricity, and com
pressed air, and within another, generation the rivalry
may be. watched by people who live in glass houses
where .cleanliness can be obtained by simply spraying
the rooms ; from a hose'pipe, and where there will be
no need Â¦ of scrubbing cloths or>soap. Â¦ The cities oi
that' time will of course be rich in decorative effects
andthe walls of: buildings will gleam' and glow with
colors of all. kinds. It is a fine future to lookfor
ward: to, for when; everybody lives in , glass houses
no one can throw stories and there will be peace in
the world. . : '

Attorney Mllburn, representing Mol
ineux, said that Hill had spoken ns If to
a Jury and claimed that he had'Improper
ly stated certain features of the case. He
again contended that the law had not
been followed in the admission of the
handwriting testimony, and that there,
had been error in admitting certain testi
mony.
When Attorney Milburn closed the case
was formally submitted. *
THE DAY'S DEAD.
Hill asserted that under the tutorship
of Mr. Carvalho, expert, in writing, thÂ©
accused learned to disguise his handwrit
ing and did disguise it in the writing he
did for Expert Kinsley. Leaving out of
consideration the expert testimony, Hill
said the State had still a complete chain
of circumstantial evidence of the guilt of
the accused. v "We have." he said, "Mol
ineux's acknowledged description of his
malady, and we have that same descrip
tion in the Marston blank. We have all
the other direct and circumstantial evi
dence that connects the prisoner directly."
In closing Senator Hill pleaded that the
case was one of Importance to the State,
that the defendant had been fairly tried,
that no substantial error had been com
mitted and that no material fact had been
excluded.
Attorney Hill said that Molineux was
a sufferer from a malady which made him
melancholy; then reviewed the trouble at
the Knickerbocker Athletic Club and pic
tured Molineux as plotting for revenge.
."The defense,"." said he, "went "through
the trial casting suspicion right and left
without reason of system, merely seeking
to avert it from their client."
BUFFALO, N. Y., June 19.-The fate of
Roland B. Molineux, convicted of murder
as the poisoner of Mrs. Katherlne J.
Adams at New York December, 189S, is in
the hands of seven Judges of the Court of
Â¦Appeals, who for three days past have
been listening to the arguments for and
against a new trial. The appeal was
finally submitted at 1:35 o'clock this aft
ernoon. The decision will not be an
nounced until some months hence, when
the court sits at Albany for the fall term.
Ex-Senator David B. Hill, for the peo
ple, insisted that it had been proved by
overwhelming evidence that Molineux had
written the letters and the address on the
poison package, and that his guilt was
clearly established. He dwelt upon the
fact that Molineux was a chemist, and
asked, "Where was the man who had
the opportunity that he had to poison his
enemies?"

FRANK G. COBURN. thÂ© pretend
ed United StateH Secret Service
operator, who tried to play a con
fidence game on United States Se-'
cret Service Agent Hazen and who
was arrested last Monday for imperson
ating a United States officer, was released
from custody yesterday on the recommen
dation of Agent Hazen.
It developed upon investigation that Co
burn had not obtained money or credit
upon his representations, and it was fur
thermore believed by Agent Hazen that
Coburn must be of weak intellect or he
would not have come to the Secret Service
office and asked Hazen for employment
on the strength of forged letters of rec
ommendation. One of iiie names forged
to the letters was that of Alfred Wilkie,
Chief of the United States Secret Service
Bureau at Washington. The signature,
however, did not resemble in the least
that of Mr. AVilkle and could not have de
ceived any one who had ever seen it
Shortly after Coburn arrived here he
called uoon Colonel Wilson, aid de camp
of General Shatter, and after introducing
himself as one of Uncle. Sam's sleuths pro
posed to accept employment to go on a
transport to Manila and unearth alleged
frauds in the commissary department.
Colonel Wilson was not in the sleuth-bus
iness and declined Coburn" a offer.
For the last three months Agent Hazen
and Operator Moffltt had been hunting
for Coburn, but they could not find him.
He was ( during the whole â¢ of Â¦ that
time working at his trade of house-paint
ing- in Woodland, Yolo County. As soon
as he returned to this city he called at
Agent Hazen's office to fill that official
with fairy tales and was bagged. Agent
Hazen confiscated the forged letters of
recommendation and advised Coburn to
mend his ways and stick to his palntpot
and brushes.

Ood is at the bottom of all true education
and tho world hns never had a great man who
did not believe in God. Education which puts
a man outside of society and out of touch with
his fellow man Is worthless. Jesus Christ came
on earth and 'labored as a carpenter. No edu

Dr. de Costa In conclusion paid a high
tribute to the efficiency of the parochtal
schools and to the Catholic colleges, and

CHICAGO, June 19.â Fine growing weather
and lower cables were the features in the
wheat situation that appeared to make the
most impression on the local operators at the
stai;t and there was exhibited a general dis
position to sell. On covering of a line of
shorts by^a local operator the^ crowd followed
the leadi causing a 1 fair upturp, but the ad
vance was not well maintained. Toward the
close there was a good cash and export de
mand, which gave encouragement to the bulls
Rains in the Southwest, where harvesting is in
full "swing, caused some timidity among the
shorts. September opened %c lower at 68%c to
68%c and, after going to 69@69%c. closed a
shade lower at 68%c.
Business in the corn pit was moderately ac
tive, with buyers largely, in the majority dur
ing the greater part of the day. Country of
ferings continue very | small and this fact,
combined with light receipts, was responsible
for the strength apparent during most of the
session. September opened unchanged at 44%c
to 44%c and on fair demand by local shorts
the price advanced to 45c. The market sagged
toward the close at 44%@44%c.
Light receipts and more or less' talk of pos
sible manipulation of July had as much to do
with the firmness in oats as anything. Sep
tember was the strongest feature, and the
greater part of the day's business was done
in that delivery. There was continued active
buying by the Interests, which supported the
market yesterday. â¢ September opened un
changed a shade higher at 26%@26%c. ' The
price was bid ' up to 26%c by local longs and
later by shorts, but afterward receded slightly
t closing %c higher at 26%c. Local receipts were
126 cars. â¢ . â¢ .
Provisions were steady and the market was
quite dull with rather an . easy undertone
There was less demand for September, which
resulted in a little setback for the whole llÂ»t
Outside longs were disposed to take profits
and local packers were also moderate sellers'
September pork closed at a loss of 10c - Lard
closed 2%@5c lower, at $8 75@8 77%. Ribs
fairly steady; closed B@7%c lower at $8 15.

ICEW TORK, June 13.â The decided activity
In to-day's stock market reflected doubts and
hesitation in the speculative mind. The many
end various fluctuations seemed to represent
cs much as anything the efforts of professional
traders to discover the actual condition of the
market by a testing process. There was un
doubtedly a considerable amount of speculative
manipulation, but thÂ« professional brokers also
had theiiÂ» share in the weakness of the market.
os was quite conclusively shown by the sub
stantial rally late in the day when they began
to lock for etocks to ccver their short contracts
tnd found a limited supply. The late rally was
achieved, however, en a light volume of deal
ings, the bidding up process by the profession
el bulls against the efforts of the bears to cov
er having Its share in the movement. It will
tx> seen that a large proportion of the trading
Â¦was congested in a few stocks, "which also
6howed the widest price fluctuations. Bt. Paul
was conspicuous In this class and the appre
hension that much 'of the recent rumors regard
ing developments in (hat stock wax purely con
ieoturaJ had much to do not only with the
movement but with the generally unsettled tone
of the trading. There wa B seemingly good au
thority cited to-day for assertions that it was
not contemplated at oil to affect any actual

Wai! Street Outlook.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"As to the immediate course of prices it
should not be forgotten that they are already
very high; some stocks have soared to dizzy
heights and are better left alone by the un
wary. On the other hand it must be admitted
there are few bearish elements in the situa
tion; in fact, almost none, except the high
prices of certain stocks and the possibility of
friction developing in some of the big deals
now under way. which would precipitate sharp
reactions, the Northern Pacific slump being
etill a smarting reminder. With easy money.
July disbursements, good crops, large railroad
earnings and good general business in sight.'
there is every prospect that the market will
gradually harden and Improve if left to itself.
What it will do under manipulation remains
to be seen. The speculative spirit is abroad
end is likely to follow any good lead until some
eccident or reaching the exhaustion point in
duces a setback. Easy money Is likely to pre
vail until the crop demand begins in August
La>t week's drop in the bank reserves was a
eurprise. but as this was due to transfers con
nected with important stock deals lt exerted
only temporary effect. In all the principal
money markets of Europe easy rates prevail,
8* illustrated by the reduction of the Bank of
Kngland rate to 3 per cent, and with Increasing
supplies of gold from the Klondike and the
Transvaal In addition to other liberal supplies
there is little prospect of any Immediate strin
gency. The June Government crop report indi
cated a heavy wheat crop in Eight with the
possibility of beating the record. Some esti
mates went ae high as 6S3 millions and others
670 mtUions. Last year we had a crop of only
E2Z millions, bo that we are comparatively sure
of ar.cther year of prosperity for the farmers
end the railroads, with a liberal margin for
later damage from weather conditions. The
wonderful demand for iron and steel has car
ried us into a new record for their manufacture,
which is now going on at a rate of over 300,000
tens per week In excess of last year's great
output. And in the face of this stocks at fur
naces show a decrease. Railroad earnings con
tinue to make very handsome gains; hence con
fidence m railroad securities is well maintained,
even at present high' prices. The latter are.
us every one knows, very largely due to the
great consolidation movement which is rapidly
placing our railroads in the control of a few
mÂ«m and insuring more stable conditions of
ra!!rosd management. Speculative operators
&re. of course, using this leverage on the mar
ket for all it Is worth, and while stocks are so
largely concentrated in strong hands as at
present, their" ability to lift prices is unusual.
It thould be remembered, however, that the big

EAN FRANCISCO. June 19. 1901â5 p. m.
The following maximum temperatures were
reported from stations in California to-day:
Eureka 58, Mount Tarr.alpais 67. San Luis
Obispo â¬S. Red Bluff 90, Fresno SS. Los Angeles

Paul or any interchange of the stock for new
bids. The absorption of a part of St. Paul
by other rival interests may go far toward con
cerning the safety of the general railroad situ
ation, but a question arises as to the increase
that would result Â¦ in the investment value of
St. Paul stock itself.' The absorption of large
amounts of stock puts it in a technical posi
tion to be easily manipulated, owing to the
large reduction in the â¢ floating Â¦ supply and
the plausibility given to rumors regarding the
plans of the .- stock. The extreme decline in
the afternoon reached 2% below last night.
Union Pacific moved in sympathy. The j ex
ports of gold - announced ..to-day .reached
only $1,230,000, leaving the week s ship
ments below $5,0O0,C00. * a â¢, further out
go is not looked for. The recogni
tion of this. fact has something to do with the
later rally of the stock market. The violent
slump in Colorado Fuel of 17 points and a sym
pathetic reaction in Tennessee Coal of 4% under
last night- were due to doubts cast upon recent
assertions that the ' company would be . ab
toibed by the. United States Steel Corporation.
St. Louis and San Francisco rose 3% over last
night late rn the day, apparently as a result
of the rights offered to stockholders in consid
eration of subscription to a cash fund. A num
ber of industrials, including American Tobacco,
gave evidence of strength without any exhibi
tion. *
The bond market was quite heavy and irreg
ular. Total sales, par value, 1,365,000. '
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

Boston Wool Market.
\ BOSTON," June 19.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: â¢ '
There- is a steady fair average business in
progress in the wool market with the tendency.
If anything, toward an Improvement. Some
houses report the trade as very quiet, but others
note an increase in the inquiry with quite an
amount of wool moving. Consumers are buying
wools only as they need them and cannot be
Induced to do otherwise, but it Is believed that
their needs are steadily but surely becoming
greater with the improvement In the goods sit
uation and as the opening of the light-weight
season draws ' nearer they will naturally be
more liberal purchasers of wool. As yet there
has been no advance in prices and any attempt
to secure an advance usually, puts a stop to
business. Medium and low wools are still bell
ing at low figures, but fine wools continue very
steady and are fully as firm as previously
noted. . â¢ ,
Territory wools are selling at practically the
same prices as those previously notedâ 40@42c.
In Oregon large sales have been made
within the past two weeks. At Pendleton
about half - a million' pounds were sold
In ; cue week, at prices - ranging f rom , 8Â®10^ic
per pound. At The Â¦'â¢ Dalles large sales are
reported as having been made to Boston par
ties In the past- week. The sales of the week
In Boston amounted to 2,182,000 pounds domestic
and 300,000 pounds foreign, making a total of
3,182.000 pounds. . against a total of 3.305,000
pounds for the previous week, and a total . of
1,484,000 pounds for the corresponding week of
last year. .
The sales since January 1 amount to 101,399,900
pounds, against 66,731,000 pounds for the corre
sponding time last year. â¢ *

/London Market.
NEW. YORK, June 19.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London â¢ financial cablegram eays:
The stock- market, to-day was an Idle one,
with quotations dropping everywhere. Ameri
can issues are retrograded with the rest. Old
time conditions of stagnation were in evidence
after the first hour's feeble trading. The open-
Ing was weak on fears that the monetary con
ditions may develop some stringency. The
market held dull and Inert after the early
decline, with no fresh movement until late in
the afternoon, when New York purchases of
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, Union Pa
cific, Atchlson and United States Steel Cor
poration caused a "better finish.

Â¦A circular for Australia Â«ays: "Since June
1 there ' have been the following deliveries of
Colonial coal, viz.:. Cardiganshire, 2109 tons;
Arracan, 3540; Spartan, 1932; Beaumonolr. 2203;
Toxteth. 3767; Lancing, 2304; total, 15.857 tons.
There are now due to arrive here from the
Colonies prior to August 1 four vessels carry
ing about 10.000 tons. The engaged list of coal
carriers from Australia, afloat and to load,
numbers only fourteen vessels with a carry
ing capacity of about 40,000 tons, whereas in
June of last year there were forty-four vesseU
engaged with a capacity of 116.C00 tons. This
is very strong evidence of how the coal business
has changed Its character and ha3 been forced
into the hands of our coast collieries, whence
our supplies are mainly drawn at present and
for many months past. Freights on coal from
Australia are declining and later on they may
be sufficiently reduced to meet our ruling mar
ket rates, but lt is improbable that the quan
tity offering will disturb present quotations.
Fuel oil is daily Increasing its sales, and at
prices that coal cannot meet. OH producers
have made a valuation for their output disre
garding cost Â¦ of producing and distributing,
hence they find the contracts they have made
for future delivery are at absurdly low prices.
What should have proved a great acquisition
to the discoverers and producers will result in
very meager returns to the investors. The car
riers and consumers are the most benefited."

STOCK MARKET.
There was less excitement In the .Gas stocks
on the morning session of the Bond Exchange,
and Gas & Electric was weaker at $43@42. The
other stocks -were quiet and not materially
changed. .. . .
The oil stocks were in fair request, though
the rccindment of the 7^c dividend which Home
Oil was to have paid to-day had an unfavora
ble effect on i the market. The dividend was
rescinded because a large customer declined
to receive any more oil under the contract.
Gas & Electric was lively again In the after
noon, selling at $42@13 23. and Pacific Gas Im

Arrested on Complaint of Annie Heg
. erty of Berkeley, Sister of
\ Carrie Sandholt.
Dr. W. H. Griswold. who has an. office
in the St. Ann building, was arrested yes
terday by Detective Coleman on a war
rant issued by Police Judge Fritz, before
whom Mrs. Annie Hegerty had sworn to
a complaint charging Dr. Griswold with
the murder of her sister. Miss Carrie
Sandholt of Centervllle. ..The arrest was
made a short time, after the Coroner's
jury had returned a verdict of murder
against the prisoner.
The doctor, when testifying before the
Coroner, swore that Miss Sandholt was
suffering from the effects of a criminal
operation when she came to him for
treatment. She informed him. ; he said,
that, she had been treated by a Dr. O'Don
nell and other physicians and that they
had left her in a dangerous condition. He
adopted the' usual course in such cases,
but the young, woman died on Saturday
of last week in the Goiden West Hotel
of blood poisoning. The prisoner admltteS
that tho patient had paid him $60 for his
services.
The most damaging testimony against
the prisoner was given by Mra. Annie
Hegerty of Berkeley. She is a sister of
Miss Sandholt. She testified that her sis
ter told her that she went to Dr. .C. C.
O'Donnell. who had given her drugs that
had no effect. She then went to Dr. Jor
dan's museum, where, after being exam
ined by a physician, she was handed over
to a young man. who took her to Dr.
Griswold. She told Mrs. Hegerty further
that Dr. Griswold had performed a crim
inal operation and that the cause of her
trouble was a young man named William
Hirsch of Irvington. _ |
DR. GRISWOIJ) CHARGED
WITH A GIRL'S MURDER
Maryland more than seventy years ago.
He went to sea as a boy, and was In the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company's service
in China when the civil war commenced.
Returning to the South he was given let
ters from the Confederate government to
operate blockade runners. He was cap
tured on the Mississippi River, took the
oath of allegiance to the United State*,
and. rendered .valuable . service to the
Northern forces. After the war he wÂ»nt
to Arizona, and later returned to the Pa
cific Mail service, being captain on ves
sels running to southern ports.
His first big stroke oi fortune was a
mere accident. He left $600 with a minin!?
broker during the big stock boom in 1877
and went to sea. Upon his return the
lucky skipper, was notified that there was
JTO.OOO to his credit in the Bank of Cali
fornia. .'.-Â¦-. . â¢
The captain did not speculate in stocks
any more, but bought real .estate, and
then spent his income like a prince. Dur
ing his Incumbency as Pilot Commission
er, under. Governor Irwin, his salary, fees
and rent roll ran into a monthly income
of $900.
The captain was a patron of the prize
ring. At the time of the Sulllvan-Corbett
fight at Mississippi City the sailor took
a "tip" from Choynski that Sullivan
would win. The captain lost $10,000 on the
.'tip. ' . ......
His property dwindled during the last
few years of his life. He was careless of
his money, and his marriages were ex
pensive to settle. -
Realizing that he was rapidly losing his
hold on his belongings. Captain Williams
last December made a deed of a $10 000
house and lot on Pine street In San Fran
cisco to Colonel C. W." Stone, upon condi
tion that Stone should pay over J60 a
month during Williams' lifetime and keen
up the property. The deed was placed" in
escrow to be delivered after Williams'
death. .-,
The captain owned a ranch near San
Jose and had some property at Â¦ Tomb
stone, A. T.. and other improved property
in San Francisco.^ A cottage at 824 Thlr
teenth street, this city, was also in his
name. . Â¦/
.Public Administrator Haines has filed
application for letters of administration
upon Captain Williams' estate, and has
set about to try to untangle the apparent
complications . in the dead seaman's af
fairs. Efforts are being made to trace the
first wife in the East, with whom Captain
Williams had been in constant correspond
ence. .His remains are being held subject
to later decision as to funeral and Inter
ment. .-.-....Â¦.. , Â¦ ' Â¦Â¦ .

by Henry Miller and his company, will
look their last on the play with the week's
end. Mr. MlUer vows that this year will
see the banishment of the pretty comedy

OAKLAND, June 19.â With the
death of Captain H.'G. Williams,
the pioneer mariner, who suc
cumbed last night at the Hotel
Crellin, the story of a romance
In his life that involves the paternity of
a beautiful girl of 1G years has been re
called. This young lady bears the name
Marie E. Williams. ,
Behind the scenes is a mysterious wo
man in widow's garb, who to-day made
her mission known to those ;who had
taken charge of the deceased seaman's
affairs. Mrs. Mary Schmidt, she says, is
her name and she declares that the tall,
willowy girl she has looked after for six
teen years is her child and that the dead
captain is the young lady's father.
This is the first suggestion of a strife
in the, courts for the fortune that, the
aged sailor is " supposed to Â¦ have left.
Three wives had Captain Williams during
his lifetime and the story of his disas
trous matrimonial ventures is hardly less
interesting than the romantic develop
ments that have followed so closely upon
the deathbed scene. Fortunes won and
lost in a day, and the exciting adventures
on sea and on land furnish a volume of
entertaining chapters that have found the
light since death's call came Â¦ to . the ' aged
seafarer. Â£
What will be done to establish the
claims of this girl is yet' to be decided by
the woman in black who asserts her
motherhood. The story runs back twenty
years or more, when Captain Williams
had exquisite bachelor apartments in the
old Mercantile Library building on Bush
street, San Francisco, the present site of
the Telephone Company's building. There
the old shipmaster, with other boon com-,
panions, held forth. Mrs. Schmidt, now a
stout' matronly appearing woman of-per
haps 55 years, was there employed.
There was a child born In the course of
the years of her employment there. =.
"The child is 1 Captain Williams' and I
am the mother," said Mrs. Schmidt. "But
all I want now is to be sure that the cap
tain Is given a proper burial. "It will be
time enough after the funeral for me to
take such steps as may be necessary, to
protect the interests of the girl." ; â¢
Then turning to her- Interviewer she
said, - with tears streaming Â¦- down her
cheeks: i "I have suffered untold agony
at the hands of Captain Williams, but for
all that I can say nothing now while his
dead body is unburied." â¢ -. .
Mrs. Schmidt refused to tell where she
resided In San Francisco, but gave the ad
dress of the girl as 815 Geary street, San
Francisco.
Friends of Captain Williams do not hes
itate In their belief that the child is his
daughter, but they declare he always re
fused to recognize her.
The' woman came into prominence In
Oakland several years ago by causing '.
Captain Williams' arrest, . after trouble
about the child while, he had rooms in
the Playter block. Â¦ The difficulty was set
tled in the courts.
DETROIT, Mich., June 19.âIn an inter
view in New York this afternoon with a
rtaff correspondent of the Detroit Jour
nal, Colonel EH R. Sutton of this city,
â¢who was the traveling companion of ex-
Goverr.or Pingree during his trip through
South Africa and Europe, said:
"Hazen S. PIngree went to South Africa
largely for jthe purpose of putting Into
practical effect three schemes for the ben
efit of the people of Michigan; first, the
reclamation of the immense pine wastes
in Michigan by planting trees; second,
the rotation of crops in Michigan; third
the transportation of every patriot Boer
and his family who desired to come to the
T'nited States. He quizzed British offi
cials on this subject, gained their ap
proval of it and had an appointment to
consult with Kruger about it. which was
prevented only by the Governor's illness.
"It was his idea to interest some
Michigan capitalists in the plan and pro
vide lands for the Boers among the rail
road systems. He thought that these cap
italists could secure very low transporta
tion rates from the seaboard to the farms
and he proposed to let the British Gov
ernment in Rome roundabout wav provide
the ships for the Boers' transportation
from Africa to this countrv. A number
of English officers now in South Africa
and some eminent public men in England
took this favorably and thought well of
It. provided it could be carried out with
out the British Government's aid in the
matter becomirig known.
"While studying the 'Black Forest' in
the interest of his reforestration idea,
Governor Plngrree even obtained the
rames of a number of Boers who were
Â¦willing to come to Michigan and assume
care of the forests he proposed to plant!"

WOODLAND, June 19.â Mrs. E. A.
Howard Is in receipt of a letter written
by Captain and Quartermaster J. S. Mor
rison of the Twentieth Infantry, under
date of Laoag, province of Ilicos Norte.
Philippine Islands, May 14, informing her
that on the previous day James Madison
Howard died of heart failure. . No papers
were found on the body that would serve
for identification, except an envelope ad
dressed to Mrs. E. A. Howard, Woodland,
Cal. This envelope was used with the
hope that it might lead to identification.
Mrs. E. A. Howard is the mother of the
deceased, who was well known and highly
esteemed in Yolo County.
Howard, after the annexation of the
Hawaiian Islands, engaged in the stock
trade of California with that country. He
made his last trip to the Islands two
years ago. His mother also went to Hon
olulu and made her home there until last
February. Howard decided to make a
prospecting trip to the Philippines and
took passage for Manila on the- 20th of
February, A few days later Mrs. Howard
Failed for San Francisco. Before Howard
left Honolulu Mrs. Howard gave him sev
eral envelopes addressed to her In Wood
land. It was one of these envelopes found
on his body that gave Captain Morrison
a clew as to the whereabouts of relatives
of the deceased.
When Howard left Honolulu he expect
ed to touch at Guam and make a stop of
ten days. So far as is known he wrote no
letters to Woodland after his departure
from Honolulu. The presumption is that
he was burled in Lanag:, although no posi
tive Information on that point has been
received.

EUVKLOPE ON BODY
BEVEALS HIS IDENTITY
Mrs.' Nellie Kelly, housekeeper at' the
Lamolle House, testified tnat Murphy was
cared, for by : Miss Smalley..
T. B. McFarland. a real estate and in
surance agent, testified that Murphy ap
plied to him for an accident insurance
policy for $20,000, which he had made pay
able to Miss Smalley. The policy had
been drawn up, the premium paid by Mur
phy, and the policy delivered to him.
Later, when the policy was sent to the
Eastern headquarters, it was returned to
the agent with the Information that the
company refused to make it payable to
vMlss Smalley, as the policy would have
to be made payable to the estate or some
of Murphy's heirs. The policy was after
ward issued payable n to the Murphy, es
tate. . _ â¢ .- .Â¦'
Murphy and Miss Smalley had visited
Mrs. Foltz Smalley in her. home, and on
these occasions Murphy had" remarked:
"She is' my little sweetheart, and is well
provided for." Witness stated that Miss
Smalley had kept the $10,000 note given
her by Murphy for services for some
months, but had given it back to Murphy
for safe keeping, and Murphy said he
would put it in a safe deposit box. What
became of the note Mrs. Smalley did not
know. At one time, the witness said.
Murphy had authorized Miss Smalley to
find a suitable home for them in San
Francisco, and he would buy It and give
the deed to her. Mrs. Smalley declared
Murphy's financial condition was not such
as to admit of him marrying at that time.
The main witness of the day was Mrs.
Bertha Foitz Smalley, a sister-in-law of
the plaintiff. She -first met Murphy in
1S94. As soon as she learned of the rela
tions existing between Miss Bertha Smal
ley and Murphy she had, discouraged
them, she Eald, and in a way ended thum.
She had visited Murphy and Miss Smalley
in San Francisco and also at the Lamolle
House in this city. Murphy had told her,
she said, that he was in love with Miss
Smalley and she was sure her sister-in
law returned the affection. On more than
one occasion Murphy had said he intended
to provide for Miss Smalley and marry
k hcr. In 1897 a coolness had developed be
tween Murphy and Miss Smalley,- and
their relations had been broken off.- The
two subsequently became reconciled.' The
witness said Murphy gave Miss Smalley
a check for $10,000 for services rendered
him fT two years, and promised to pay
her J50CQ a year until he could arrange
his affairs and marry her. This state
ment had not been Included In a deposi
tion made by the witness In Attorney
Kowalsky's office, and Attorney Delmas
questioned her in regard to It. She said
it had been forgotten.
SAN JOSE, June 19.â That the late capi
talist, James T. Murphy, intended to pro
vide for, if not marry, Miss Bertha Smal
ley before his death was testified, to in
court by two witnesses | to-day. The life
and habits of Murphy were gone into fully,
and it was stated that Murphy made Miss
Smalley his companion most of the time,
and In the three years preceding his death
she was always' with "him. "According to
witnesses he had reiterated that the plain
tiff would be provided for and that he In
tended to marry her. Besides this it was
declared Murphy had given Miss Smalley
a check for $10,000 for two years' services,
and had promised to pay her $5000 a year

SHREVEPORT, June 19.-Frank Smith,
better known as "Prophet" Smith, and F.
D. McLand. held at Benton for complicity
In the murder of John Gray Foster, were
taken out of jail by a mob to-night and
strung up to a tree. They were left dan
gling side by side. The lynching occurred
on the Arkansas road, about one mile
and a half from the Jail. Both negroes
made a statement before death, denying
that they had anything to do with the
killing. Smith, who was the head of the
"Church of God" movement in that sec
tion and was blamed as having been re
â¢sponsible for the sentiment against tho
whites which led to the death of Foster,
died praying. McLand was silent as ha
was strung up.
As Smith was being led from the Jail
prior to the execution he was heard to
say: "Lord, you promised to be with me
now."
There were about 200 armed men In thÂ«
mob and they overpowered the Sheriff
and jailer, taking the keys away from
them. The lynchers claimed that the ex
ecution of these negroes was necessary
to the preservation of the lives of the
white men in this locality.

Resolutions eulogizing the work of the
late ex-Governor . Pingree- of Michigan
were adopted. - -
J; H. Cook, chairman of the Populist
State Central Committee, . stated that he
"would soon issue a call to some of the
State Populist committees, at least those
in Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Colorado,
inviting them to take up the work of unit
ing the reform forces in the country into
the third party, with the ultimate purpose
of effecting a national organization.
The committee organized by electing J.
H. Cook, Fusion-Populist, chairman; W.
H. Hillls, Middle-of-the-Road Populist,
vice chairman; F. S.' Kowalski, Public
Ownership member, secretary.
Merri weather at the conclusion of the
conference was asked:.
"Will not your movement only result in
turning' the State over to the Republi
cans?"
"I- don't know, but I would a little
rather have the Republicans win than the
present organization of Democrats. As
Mr. Bryan said to me last Monday, "I
like an enemy under his own* colors better
than one who flies my colors."
ATLANTA, Ga., June 19.â The Atlanta
Constitution to-night, in . response to a
telegram of inquiry, received a dispatch
from W. J. Bryan denying that he is af
filiated Â¦ with the third party movement.
Mr. Bryan's telegram reads: ,- : .
IOWA CITY, la.. June 19.â The Constitution,
Atlanta: Telegram jrecelved. No truth in re
port. ' ~~ W. J. BRYAN.
KANSAS CITY, June 19.â The "allied
third '. party; movement," which; its pro
moters predict will result before 1904 in: a
national organization .. strong enough to
name a Presidential ; nominee, was
launched here this afternoon, t .-'
The conference was called, by Lee Mer
rlweather^of St.; Louis, who with twenty
two St. Louis leaders in the Public Own
ership party of that -city came to Kansas
City yesterday after a visit to Mr. Bryan
at Lincoln," where the Intention of the del
egation had been laid before the Nebraska,
statesman. Mr. Bryan, it was said, had
expressed sympathy with the movement.
Populists of , all persuasions,; Public
Ownership advocates, Free Silver Repub
licans', socialists, Single- taxers and Bryan
Democrats were represented. It was "said
that it was proposed to form a third party
in Missouri,. which. should finally be^-taken
up by the- dissatisfied in the old parties
from other States. A committee on or

Commissioner Maguire of Soard of
Works Declares Funds Neces
sary Are at Hand.
.. Commissioner Maguire of the Board of
Public Works, who has in charge the im
.provement of the Mission Road from Sil
ver avenue to Onondaga avenue, stated

in sight and the Improvement is now as
sured. Maguire has collected the sum of
53000 from property owners and other in
terested partl3-s. which, together with the
$15,000 appropriated by the Board of Su
pervisors in the next tax budget, makes
J23.000 already collected.

no trouble to collecting the remaining
S7000 of the $30,000 required to do the work.

Plans Desired for Two New
Twelve-Room School
Buildings.
Â»
Resolved, That the Beard of Public
"Works be and it is hereby requested
to advertise at once for bids for paint
ing the interior woodwork of the Hor
ace Mann and the Washington schools
and tinting the walls of the Wash
ington School.
The foregoing resolution was adopted
yesterday by the Board of Education as a
result of the expose in yesterday's Call of
the illegal invitation of bids to do the
work mentioned. Notwithstanding the
charter specifically provides that the
Board of Public Works shall have con
trol of all alterations, repairs and im
provements of schools, the Board of.-Edu
cation had decided to have the work done
on its own responsibility. Three contrac
tors received inside information from the
Directors that the work was to be per
formed and they were requested to sub
mit bids. As the estimated cost was about
$700. the only legal way in which the pro
posals could be invited would be by pub
lication for five days in the official news
paper.
Under the charter the Board of Public
Works alone has the power to advertise.
The Board of Education, however, was
preparing to award the contract to the
lowest of the three bidders when it
changed its base after Auditor Wells no
tified it that he would not sign the de
mands unless the contract was legally
awarded. - - Â¦ .
Notwithstanding that the Board of
Works consented to the illegal proceed
ing, the Board of Education thought bet
ter end decided not to ignore the charter,
but to make legal requisition on the Board
of Works for the painting.
The committee of the Association of
Collegiate Alumnae, which consists of
Emma Hefty, chairman; Julia Reid Wil
lard. Miss McNeill, Adelaide Brown and
Florence Dorsey, submitted a report of
its investigation to the Board of Educa
tion yesterday. It is recommended that
the position of supervisor of sewing be
created and a course be adopted. The
committee Itself has acted, as temporary
supervisors of sewing for the fiscal year
1900-01. The report says:
Nine schools were visited by the committee â
Crocker. Everett, Hearst, Denman, Spring Val
ley. Hamilton, Pacific Heights, Rlncon and
Clement. A very small number of children have
any instructions in sewing outside of school,
and the teaching of it in pome districts is an
absolute necessity in order to establish a spirit
of self help.
The work In the different classes varied
greatly, from that of> the careless uninformed
teacher to that of the enthusiastic teacher
whose intelligent handling of the subject was
self-evident. A well-graded course of lessons
Is unquestionably necessary In order to set a
correct standard and be productive of uniformly
good results. A permanent supervisor of sew
ing would be a stimulus to the teachers new in
this work.
The course suggested by the committee
was adopted by the board, which took the
matter of a supervisor of sewing under
advisement.
The Board of Works was requested to
prepare plans and specifications for two
new twelve-class, school buildings and for
an additional story to the Sherman Pri
mary School. The erection of the new
buildings will not be commenced imme
diately and their location has not yet been
decided upon.
The board rejected the recommendation
of the Board of Examination that Miss
Harriet E. Rademaker, Miss > D. War
schauer and Miss Ida Garbarlno be

Edgar Geirshofer, who Is wanted in New
York on a charge of grand larceny for
having, it is alleged, stolen over $16,000.
is supposed to be in hiding In this city.
After his arrest and subsequent release
in San Rafael the other day Geirshofer,
accompanied by a woman who is supposed
to be his wife, boarded a launch, which
was in waiting, and came over to this aide
of the bay. Geirshofer wore a disguise !n
the shape of false whiskers and a black
slouch hat, which was pulled down over
his face. Knowing that the detectives
were after him Geirshofer. after disem
barking from the launch, took a hack and
was driven to a house on Pacific street.
Captain Seymour, on learning that he had
reached 1 ' this city, sent two of his men to
arrest him. They visited the house .in
which he was supposed to > have taken
refuge, but failed to find him. His wife
met the detectives at the door and did not
offer any objection to them searching the
house. Since then Geirshofer has been
seen several times on Market street, ac
companied by a man who is' supposed to
have assisted him in secretly leaving San
Rafael. ' *
Gelrshofer's arrest was brought about
by a woman named Mrs. .McFarlane. She
was jealous of hi* wife, and to be re
venged she., notified the police of his
whereabouts. . Detective Hammill was
sent to San Rafael, and he had little trou
ble in finding, the much wanted fugitive.
After he was locked up Geirshofer sued
for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that
he was being unlawfully deprived of his
liberty. He was discharged from custody
after a brief hearing and at once came to
this city. Captain Seymour Is incensed at
the action of the San Rafael magistrate
in turning the fugitive loose, and he in
tends to do all In his power to again land
him behind prison bars.

claim her. The police are Inclined to be
lieve that she has been abandoned by her
parents. ' .
When the train arrived from the south
yesterday morning a lady leading a little
girl by the hand approached Sergeant Ma
honey and said that she had come from
Bakersfleld with the little girl, expecting
to meet the child's parents. She" said she
was sick and would have to return at
once, i Mahoney took charge of the child
and instructed Policeman O'Callaghan to
take her to the City Prison till her par
ents called for her. Â¦
The woman told Sergeant Mahoney that
the child's name was Josie Morgan, but
the little one says her name* is Ruth Jo
sephine | Hooker. 4 She does not know the
name of â¢ Josie Morgan. She says her
mother's name is Viola and she has a
brother 14 . years .of age, whose name is
Roy George Hooker. Her grandmother,
is called Nita and she has an uncle
named- : Frank Creo and > an aunt. Josie
Creo. The child has a. distinct straw

'j|- EROME A. FIL.LMORE of the
I Southern Pacific Company has been
I called upon to resign and. his suc-
QJJ cessor, J.. M. Herbert, general su
perintendent of the St. Louis, Iron
Mountain and Southern Railway, arrived
in the city Monday from St. Louis, accom
panied by his wife/ and' registered at the
Palace.
This- is another . aggressive '.step that.
President Hays has taken and Is evident
ly made after due consideration of facts.
Fillmore is immensely popular with- all
railroad men and his retirement, when
officially announced, will be a severe blow
to the operating department. He is the
friend of the engineers, conductors, brake
men and air others in the operating de
partments, and at all times that they had
fancied or real wrongs they went -to him
to tell their grievances and to ask him to
mediate for them. -
The cause of Flllmore's withdrawal is
not definitely known, but some who are
supposed to possess the knowledge give
two reasons. The first is that Fiilmoro
from the first never made a favorable Im
pression upon Hays and consequently
headed the list as one that was to be re
moved. The second reason given Is that
Flllmore's personality is most deceiving.
He is a biff, heavy man, slow of move
ment and entirely the opposite to Hays'
idea of a railroad manauer. v
J. M. Herbert came out from St. Loula
on a railroad pass furnished him. by. Sec
retary Ingram, confidential man.'- and
majordomo to Hays. Immediately upon
Herbert's arrival in the- city he reported
at the "big yellow building" and awaited
orders. He was informed that Hays, who
is now in Chicago, would not arrive here
until Friday and was advised- to pay a
visit to Del Monte, accompanied by- his
wife, while he had the opportunity, â¢ Her
bert went out of town at once, though he
still retained his rooms at the Palace,
leaving no address. Last evening there
was a big bundle of letters .waiting his
return, but he -is. not- expected' to come
back until President Hays returns.
With the arrival of Herbert theipayroll
of the Southern Pacific will now have two
prominent Eastern â¢ railroad men, pro
teges of Hays. H.-E. FItzhugh, who ar
rived here about two months ago, Is [ al
ready in the employ of the company, and
is at present down Jn Southern Califor
nia' inspecting- the work of . overhauling
the tracks of the new Â¦ coast B division.-
Herbert is a friend of Hays and was em
ployed by him many â¢ years ago. . He - 19
looked upon as a splendid Â¦ operating offi
cial with up to date methods. â¢ - : ,
President Hays has promised to issue an
official circular when any changes or ap
pointments of importance are to be made.
No circular has yet Â¦ announced the ap
pointment of FItzhugh; and it is supposed
that Hays, when he. hands. out his mis
sive, wants It to be full of surprises. The
resignation of Fillmore and the appoint
ment of Herbert in his place will stagger
the old railroad men. â¢ Â¦ Â¦ .

SAD ENDING TO LIFE ,
OF WELL-KNOWN WOHLAH
Urs. Minnie B. Tittell, Mother of the
Three Actresses, Expires on
'. _Train.
Â¦ Mrs. Minnie E. Tittell. mother of tha
"Tittell sisters" and herself well known,
particularly to theatrical people, died
June 9 at Florence, Kan., on a Santa Fe
train, en route to Chicago. The body was
brought back to San Francisco, arriving
Monday, and was buried Tuesday in
Cypress Lawn Cemetery. .
Mrs. Tittell Â¦ was widely known to San
Franciscans of thirty years ago. Her hus
band owned the property on the south
side of Bush street, between Kearny
street and Grant avenue, and Tittell's
Hall, where Norman's is now located,
Â¦was one of the most popular resorts in
the city. .
After her husband's death Mrs. Tittell
became reduced in circumstances, and
her three daughters, ! Charlotte, Essie
and Minnie, j went on the stage while
yet children. They became great fa
vorites with theater-goers, and all are
now high in legitimate drama.
Mrs. Tittell had lived for six years past
at 1206 Market street. Her mind became
deranged the day McKinley arrived in
San Francisco and partial paralysis fol
lowed her mental ailment. Charlotte Tit
tell had been visiting her and had left" for
New York only two days before. Her son-Â»
in-law,- George E. Crater, husband of Es
sie Tittell,' came out from New York and
-started East with Mrs. Tittell, intending
to -have her placed in a private sani
tarium, but she succumbed to her illness
en route and the son-in-law returned with
the body.
The daughters all reside in New York.
A. sister. of deceased, Mrs. Frankie King,
lives in San Francisco, and another re
sides in 'Fresno.
Peter Martin need prevaricate no
longer, nor blush progressive blushes. that
cover him from chin to brow, when lead
ing questions are put to him and the name
of Miss Lillie Oelrichs is mentioned. His
secret *is out at last and Peter is open to
congratulations. Whatever, the reasons
were, that made it necessary to keep the
pleasant news a secret they have been
zealously guarded from an interested pub
lic. The Oelrichs have been discreet and
Peter . Martin equally silent. The swell
-from Burlingame apparently believes that
discretion is the better part of a man, for
even at this stage of his romance he
maintains that it would not be gentle
manly, of him to make any announce
ment; and further, he wants Kis.friends
to withhold their well meant congratula
tions until he gets news direct from Mrs.
Oelrichs that his betrothal is announced.
Being an engaged man has changed
Peter Martin greatly. He has become
silent and even so modest that he will
not admit for publication that the heart
and the promise of the hand' of the New
York belle are his.
"I can't make or confirm any announce
ment," said Mr. Martin last evening, as
he, was enjoying his dinner in the com
pany of his mother at the family home
out.' on Broadwuy. "A gentleman never
makes such an announcement. It is cus
tomary for the family of the lady to do
that." .
"But you know that you are engaged?"
queried, the interviewer..
"I know nothing," said Mr. Martin, and
he said it so positively that there could
be no question of denying his assertion.
The. announcement of the . betrothal
causes not a -little stir in the swell New
York set. Rumors of the engagement of
Miss Oelrichs and Mr. Martin have been
so constantly afloat and so persistently
denied by, the mother of the fair young
bride-to-be that the formal announcement
of the engagement following so soon upon
a denial occasioned not a little good-na
tured -gossip.^
The news of the engagement came in
the following dispatch: N. '.
NEWPORT, . R. I., June 19.â Mr. and Mrs.
Charles M. Oelrichs announced to-day . the en
gagement of their daughter, Miss Natalie Oel
rlchs, to Peter D. Martin of San Francisco.
This engagement has been frequently rumored
of late, but the rumors have always been de
nied. . : ' '.
Society people will be glad to know that the
weddlngr will be an event of the Newport sea
son, taking place the last Â¦week in August. *
As Miss Oelrlchs and Mr. Martin are both
members of the Roman Catholic church, the
ceremony, will be performed In one of the large
Roman Catholic edifices of the city.
Miss Oelrichs, who is known to her friends
as "Llllie," has been much admired for her
personal beauty. She is a. tall, graceful girl
with light wavy hair and expressive blue eyes.
She Is a skillful whip and Is. considered one
of the most vivacious and interesting oPths
younger set ! of girls at Newport. . She has
acted as bridesmaid at some of the most not
able of recent society weddings at Newport
and in New York.
Mr. Oelrlchs.i father of the prospective bride,
is a broker In New York. He is a brother
of Hermann Oelrlchs. Henry ' Oelrichs and
Mrs. William Jay. Mies Oelrlchs' mother was
formerly Miss Blanche DeLoosey and- is a sis
ter of Mrs. Theodore A. Havemeyer.
Mr. Martin and his bride will go to Buffalo
Immediately after their weddlngr, and later
they will bo abroad to hunt in Ireland. It la

Newport and part in Burlingame.
