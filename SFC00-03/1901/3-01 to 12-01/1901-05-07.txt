EL PASO. Tex.. May 6.â The Pres
idential train left El Paso at 1
o'clock this afternoon. The first
stop to-morrow will be at Phoe
nix, Ariz. The features of to
day's entertainment of the
President and his party were a parade and
public sneaking in El Paso and a break
fast given in Juarez, Mexico; in honor of
Mrs. McKinley.
Early this morning El Paso's streets
and plazas were filled to overflowing with
people from both sides of the Rio Grande.
Delegations from Old Mexico played an
important part in the entertainment.
There were in the parade not only the
distinguished citizens of the neighboring
republic sent here by President Diaz, but
there were three or four companies of
marching: Mexicans and .three Mexican
bands of music. From a spectacular point
of view the parade was the most Interest
ing in the President's Jour
ney. There were companies of Federal
and Confederate veterans, lodges of
benevolent and fraternal societies, a long
line of carriages containing distinguished
.'guests from Mexico, platoons of police
and the El Paso fire department. A num
ber of El Paso young .men were "dressed
as Indian braves and rode their horses in
Indian file.
School Children in Parade.
Following them was the most beautiful
part of the parade. Twelve hundred school
children In columns of fours marched be
hind a band of music. In the 'lead were
the kindergarten classes, about 150 in
number and dressed alike. Each one car
ried an American flag and kept it waving
throughout the parade.
Mrs. SIcKinley viewed the parade from
a carriage.
The President addressed, a large crowd
near the principal plaza of the town. He
said: "':"â¢?

Governor's Failure to Ex
tend Invitation Arouses
Congressman's Anger
Congressman S. D. "Woods was not one
of the "Governor's party" that left last
evening by the Southern Pacific private
car attached to the Owl train. He resents
â¢Â¦deeply the failure of Governor Gage to
extend an invitation to himself and his
colleagues and is not willing- to put him
self in a position possibly to. receive a fur
ther snub from the Governor.
It has been commonly supposed that the
Congressmen received their invitations to
be present at the official welcome to the
President from the Governor, but such
Is not the case. Henry T. Scott Is3ued the
invitations. Informing the Congressmen
at the same time that J. C. Stubbs, vice
president of the Southern Pacific, would
advise with them ' in regard to . the time
and transportation to Redlands. Later
each of those invited received a second
invitation, this time from the Southern
Pacific Company, and they were informed
that a special Pullman car would be at
their service.
At no time did Governor Gage, either
orally or in -writing-, ask the California
Congressmen to participate in the formal
welcome to President McKinley.
"Gage is not fit to occupy the Gover
nor's chair." Congressman "Woods said
last night. -"and after his attitude in this
matter I do not propose to put myself in
danger of a personal snub from him. I am
a member of Congress, occupying a posi
tion of greater hon<w than a Governor
ship possesses. If I were to-be at Red
lands at the official welcome to the Presi
dent I would not consider myself a mere
satellite to Governor Gage. Yet if I took
other than such a part the Governor
might turn upon me and say, '"Who are
you, anyway? Who asked you to join
rs?'
â¢'I am not such, a fool as to go under
such circumstances. I told both Need
ham and Coombs that they were foolish
to go after one gubernatorial snub and
at the risk of another."

Haviner said this much and expressing the
very great satisfaction It has given me to
meet you here at your ' homes, seeing how
comfortable you ail are and learning vour de
votion to the great nation over which by your
suffrages I am permitted for a short time to
preside. I bid you all good afternoon and may
God bless you all.
It grlves me very great pleasure to meet the
people of this territory, who have thronged
hither to give greeting to the President of
the United States. I rejoice at the. progress
you are making, the prosperity you are enjoy
ing, the happiness and contentment I see on
vour faces and the evidences of progress every
where discernible. You gave part of your ter
ritory tp Colorado, which Is now one of the
States of the Union; you gave of your terri
tory to make the territory of Arizona, and
you still have more territory, twice over than
the United Kingdom of Great' Britain. (Ap
plause.) What you wont here is more rain
and more people. (A' voiceâ " We want to be
connected with you so as to get more rain.")
My friend says you want ' to be connected
with us. Tou are connected with us. You
are of us and close to us. The flag floats
over you as it floats over all: I; appreciate
thW the hope for association with the United
StÂ«es in the relation of statehood spring*
eternal in the. territorial bosom .(applause), and
it is a â¢ Just and honorable and proper as
piration for you to have. Â¦ ' * â¢' ; $
I am sure you will share with me.- to-day In
the expression of sympathy which all of us
feel for the great loss sustained ' in the city
of Jacksonville by the fire that swept over
that city. Thousands have been rendered
homeless and the heart of the' nation goes
out to the suffering and recalls to me, this
being my first Rtop Ktnce leaving the great
State of Texas, that it was with deep regret
that I could not visit Galveston and meet
her brave people. It was last October that
the hurricane swept over Galveston and de
stroyed a large portion of the property In that
enterprising city. The loss of life was ap
palling but with the energy and the enter
prize and the splendid spirit of these people,
all Americans, they have rebuilt that great
city, great as It was before. That is the
American spirit wherever you find it: It Is
the spirit of progre?j, the spirit of advance
ment.
I trust some time In the future. I cannot
tell when.- 1 do not know when, but some timp
in the future, the Consrress of the UnitPd
States will see- fit to make you one of the

collections of drawn work In this country,
expressed her delight at the gift. Mrs.

the conclusion of the addresses the party,
Including the Mexican officials, went for
a drive. The President expressed a de
sire to take a look over into Mexico and
was driven down to the international
boundary. There at the office of the
United States customs office he alighted
and chatted for some time with those
around him. The old church of Guada
loupe, over 300 years old, the Spanish,
prison and other interesting buildings in
Juarez were pointed out- to him. From,
the bridge he could plainly see the Sierra
Madre Mountains, sixty miles to the
southward. President Harrison in 1S91
went half-way across the bridge, but
President McKinley to-day did not so
much as set foot upon the structure. On
the way back to the city the party
stopped and cheered the Mexican con
sulate.
Mrs. McKinley and the ladies of the
party were entertained this morning in a
most unique tnanner, , when the distin
guished company crossed the Rio Grande
and spent the morning, in Juarez, Mexico.
They were the guests of Mrs. B. F. Ham

eleven of the prominent club and society
ladles of this city. :
After driving around the quaint old
Mexican town, the party was treated to
a typical Mexican breakfast in the patio
of Tnocent Ochoa, one of the wealthy
residents. Mexican wines, fruits and vi
ands of every description were served.
Every article, even the flowers and
draperies, was imported from the Presi
dent's palace In the City of Mexico. The
Tequila wine, made from the cacti and
fifty years old. was the gift of President
Diaz. The national wine, pulque, was
also served with each of the seventeen
courses. The breakfast is said to have
cost $110 a plate. The menus were paint

remove the objection raised by the Isth

Canal Company, with the approval of the
Colombian Government, has announced
the terms upon which it will sell the Pan

containing its proposition was submitted
to Rear Admiral Walker, chairman of
the commission, to-day by Dr. Martinez
Silva, Colombian Minister.
No price is ret by the company for its
property and franchise. It suggests the
appointment of appraisers, one by the
United States and Â¦ one by the company,
these two appraisers to select a third, the
estimate cf the board thus formed to be
final. No conditions whatever are at

and will, it is expected by advocates of

"The concession of the company con

WASHINGTON, May 6.â It is learned
from an authoritative source that before
Secretary Hay left here for the "West he
had several conferences with Lord

the general results of the conversations
and of the memorandum to the authorities
In London, and it is doubtless to this that
allusion is made In the London dis
patches. It is said, however, that the ne
gotiations are so tentative and informal
that they are not regarded as an official
exchange or proposition. What they em
body is not known here, though it is un
derstood they are chiefly an exposition of
the views of the United States Senators
as to the essential features which should

in the negotiations r_re 'a neutralizing of

Pleased With;the New^
SOUTHAMPTON, May 6.â The V Sham
rock II had her second spin this morn
ing. A fresh squally northeast wind
promised just the conditions' Captain
Sycamore desired to supplement Satur
day's light r breeze trial. The chief in
terest now centers in the cup challenger's
behavior when poking her long bow Into
a rough sea. . .
A preliminary brush between the two
Shamrocks , is , expected "Wednesday, but
the first match 'race round a set course is
not: likely to take place until late In "the
week or. early; next week. Mr. Fife will
arrive here Saturday to take charge of
the Shamrock:!.
The preparations for getting under way
< were started early. When the two Sham
rocks were still inside Southampton water
1 the wind drew north and became light.
The challenger set a club topsail and the
Shamrock I set a much larger club top
sail. At the start the challenger ran out
ahead, but the "Shamrock I, catching a
good breeze, soon began to overhaul her.
The challenger, set a jib and staysail, but
though the breeze here was light and the I
water smooth- the Shamrock I held close
astern, losing nothing from Nettley to
Calshot. There, they hauled in the wind
and reached along in a fresher breeze,
the challenger leading by half a minute
passing the spit light.
After clearing the spit light the new
Shamrock drew away from the older boat
rapidly. The real spin was begun later,
however, when the two yachts were lined
up off the squadron. At the signal the
Shamrock II gave the advantage of the
start to the Shamrock I, with the seeming
intention of seeing If she could make up
half a mile on the retch out of Lyming
ton. The experiment was apparently sat
isfactory, for the new yacht in half an
hour had drawn ahead und_er the lee of
the older craft. She then ' threw round
and just failed to cross ahead of the
Shamrock I. Passing close astern of the
latter Shamrock II was luffed up and
pointing very high passed the Shamrock
I wide to the weather, bearing away
across the latter's bows, offering ample
proof that she was not pushed to her full
limit. Then the Evih took up position
and the two sailing craft rounded, the
Shamrock II slowing down so that the
Shamrock I- went over the line two min
utes ahead.
All the way down the Shamrocks had
a good ten-knot breeze and a strong tide
with littfe sea with them. Under these
conditions the Shamrock 1 was no match
for the new challenger.
Jib and topsail were set as the boats
ran back to Cowes Roads. All the way
back they had a strong tide and a stern
wind, which fell lighter. Going free the
.new yacht was quite unable to catch the
Shamrock I and for five miles there was
no perceptible change in their positions.
A big reaching jib was tried on the Sham
rock II. but even then the older boat held
. her distance and at the finish of the spin
the gap between them was practically the
same as when they started.

HORSES THAT CROSSED v ,
WIRE IN FIRST PLACE
"Son of Napoleon" is an adaptation of
"L'Aiglon," in which' Bernhardt. and Co
quelin appeared some months ago at the
same house. The. audience' last night was
not as large as was expected, the title of
the play not appealing to the public ap
petite. Dramatic' situations in the piece
are few and widely separated, and It was
only the excellent acting of Florence
Stone as the Duke de Reichstadt and Jack
Webster as Michel Lambert, the soldier
of the old guard, that made the thing 1 go
at all. Great praise Is accorded the man-,
Grand Opera-House.
These are the principal characters; the
subordinate ones were taken well if not
with that unusual excellence that charac
terized the principals. The setting and
stage management showed that careful
realism of which Mr. â¢ Herne is our befct
living exponent. The inevitable roast'tur
key and the equally inevitable baby one
would gladly have missed. â¢ ,
Does Mr. Herne when himself present
allow his actors to break the dramatic
illusion by taking a curtain call at the
close of a scene? Curtain calls at the
end of acts are bad enough, but within
the acts they are simply intolerable. They
violate every principal of dramatic art
and completely nullify, the realistic effects
Mr. Henry builds up so laboriously.
Banish then the curtain calls, the baby
and the roast turkey and I know not
where you will find a -better, American
play, better acted.

Equally good, though in a.' very different
line, was \V. T. Hodge as the house, sign,
and ornamental painter and glazier and
choir leader of Sag Harbor. The very cut
of his trousers was a standing or rather
a walking joke.
JAMES A. HERNE'S "Sag Harbor,"
produced last night at the Columbia
Theater, Is the best -play that has
visited San Francisco since. Bern
hardt and Cocuelin. left us. The
story, as Mr. Herne acknowledges in his
title page, is old â the love of two brothers
for the same girlâ nor can it be said that
the treatment of this story is particularly
novel or convincing.. The interest lies.al
most entirely in the character sketching,
but how' clever and at times even subtle
that is! 'First comes ; the part Mr., Herne
wrcte forhimselfâ that of Dan "Marble,
the old captain who "scallops" in sum
mers and sails company winters; a kind
hearted old busybody, whose â¢ mistake
brings about the complication that gives
the play what purely dramatic interest it
possesses. Mr. George Woodward played
the part admirably; I doubt if Mr.
Herne himself could have played it better.
As foil to him we have Elizabeth Ann,
Turner, spinster, who for many years re
fuses to marry Captain Marble because
she will not live alone in a house with a
man, and -who succumbs at last (in the
genteelest way imaginable) only under
the influence of salted peanuts and Ro
chester champagne, at a dollar a quart
Never have 1 seen anything- more genu
inely humorous than was Miss Abbott in
this' character. Yet she had to share the
acting honors with Miss Fanchon Camp
bell, who ha3 improved immensely since
she got away from the Frawley Company
and who played the difficult role of the
heroine, Martha Reese, with a pathos that
was at once genuine and ;artistic.

The Nelll Company, in "The Lottery.- of
Love," at the California, is sure to prove
a drawing card. The play. Is bright and
Tivoli.
The fifth and last week of "The- Idors
Eye" shows no decrease in the drawing
powers of the tuneful and merry comic
opera, and the performance last night
went with as much vim as on the first
presentation. The attraction could easily
run for some time, but arrangements have
been made to produce "The Toy Maker"
next week.
"The Octoroon" opened at the Central
Theater last evening. The cast was good.
Mason Mitchell did clever work- as Wah
notee and, with Cummings, won a curtain
call for the duel scene, which was well
deserved. Lorena Atwood was an attrac
tive and sufficiently mournful Zoe. Robert
Cummings was a sufficiently good Jacob
Mcxblosky to win the heart-felt execration
of the gallery. This was manifested in
hisses as the story unrolled. James Cor
riean was good as Salem Scudder, and the
minor parts were well done. In the levee
scene there was some clever dancing and
some especially good juvenile work. Many
a - more pretentious play has been less
carefully staged. The general effect
was quite realistic. The bayou and^cane
break scenes were striking. "The Octor
oon" is billed for the week.

The comedy drama "Friends", was pre-.
sented at the Alcazar Theater last night
to a house that' was packed to the doors.
The occasion was for the benefit of St.
Brigid's church, and every seat was occu r
pied. The immense audience enjoyed the
play thoroughly. Howard Â¦ Scott did a
clever piece of character work as Hans
Otto the drunken father. He was hon
ored by two special calls before the cur
tain at the close of the third act. Bartin
Hill's John Paden Sr. was a finished per
formance and Josepn Kilgour as John
Paden Jr. and Charles Bryant as Adrian
Karje were excellent. Richard Scott as
the villain, Harold Hunting, was good.
Miss Lila Convere as Marguerite Otto
was as charming and effective as ever and
Miss Agnes Rankin as Jennie Merry
weather was clever. "The Conquerors"
will be' presented for the balance of the
week.
Alcazar.
Whatever else San Francisco lacks she
never wants for the best that is going in
the vaudeville line, and a particularly
brilliant combination of vaudevillains has
charge of the - Orpheum entertainment
this week. The Agoust family with their
wonderful jugglery a la. carte, still lead
â¢in interest, and Mclntyre and Heath are
also first favorites. The latter black
face team exploits a new coon conceit,
"The Georgia Minstrels," that is simply
luscious in Its humor and "coon" in every
chuckle of its delicious grandiloquence.
The four Huntings, eccentric acrobatic
dancers, hzg new stars of the week and
do some crxcellent work in the comic song
and-dance Une. Zeb and Zarrow are also
new and give a capital comedy bicycle
act, with some features not before seen
here. Zebâ or Zarrowâ climbs steps on
his machine, skips rope/ goes steeplechas
ing over Zarrow (or Zeb) in a highly ex
citing fashion. With a triple horizontal
bar the Patterson brothers perform some
astonishing feats; ending with a mlghty
long-dlstance hand jump from one bar
to the other clear across the stage.- Â¦
Alf Grant, with his sketches from life,
seems as great a favorite as ever and ap
pears this week in an entirely new reper
toire of songs and jokes. Barnes and

ancing feats. -

They Are Discovered in the Coroner's
Office by Detective Tom
Coleman.
The missing shoes of Fred Hathaway,
who committed suicide by Inhaling illu
minating gas a short time ago, have been
found in the Coroner's office. After read
ing the story in yesterday's Call, in which
the brother of the dead man charged the
deputies in the Morgue with failing- to re
turn to him the effects of his deceased
relative, Coroner Leland lost no time in
making an investigation. While he was
interrogating his deputies Detective Cole
man, who was present, espied a pair of
shoes on a shelf which answered the de
scription of the ones Hathaway had pur
chased the day preceding his tragic end
ing.
"Those are the shoes." answered one of
the deputies. "They must have fallen out
of the package."
Coleman took the shoes and turned them
over to Hathaway's brother. The only ex
planation of the Morgue deputies as to
how they gave the relatives of the dead
man a well-worn pair of shoes instead of
the new pair, which were purchased
shortly before his death, is that they must
have "fallen out of the package contain
ing his effects." The new hat which the
suicide wore is still missing, but the po
lice thlnk'it will eventually turn up in the
Coroner's office. , .
MISSING SHOES OF A
SUICIDE ARE FOUND
Captain Seymour at once detailed two
cf his best men on the case with instruc-
"I know he has been murdered or
Ehanghaied." sadly -*said the distracted
Â¦woman. "He would not remain away un
less something has happened to him.
On leaving me Saturday he promised to
return in a short time and bring the pro
visions that he intended to buy. I am
satisfied something dreadful has hap
pened him. He was always a good and
dutiful husband, and I am convinced that
the strange man who met him Just as he
left our house and induced him to go to
the water front with him either killed
him or shanghaied him."
Hayes left his home on Mission street
last Saturday afternoon, intending to
purchase some provisions. As he did not
return by nightfall his wife became anxi
ous and went in search of him. From an
acquaintance she learned that after
Hayes left home he met a stranger, who
Informed him that he was wanted on the
water froht. They both boarded a' car
bound for the ferries and since then
Hayes has not been seen. His Â¦wife, Â¦who
Is distracted over . the disappearance,
Jears that the stranger either put him
out of the way or had him shanghaied.
Yesterday she visited police headquarters
and invoked the aid of Captain Seymour.

ployed in the transport service, is among

'â¢ Calnan's Bonds Forfeited.
The bonds of Timothy, J. 'Calnan, the
policeman who was" arrested in July last
on a charge 'of. grand larceny for stealing
a horse from a stable oh his. beat, , were
declared forfeited by Judge Conlan yes
terday. The . bonds < were for $2000,. the
sureties ' being Daniel . Hartnett. - saloon
keeper. McAllister, street, near Larkin,
and William Gibbons, rancher, Humboldt
County. After being released Calnan dis
appeared and his ' sureties, and . the police
have failed to get any .trace of him, al
though he has since been. joined by his
wife. If he should be re-arrested .the for
feiture of the bonds will Jae set aside.
Henry Pradels, proprietor of the house
at 279 O'Farrcll street, where the defend
ant, lives, testified that the latter and
Mike Nolan had a conversation In the
kitchen about three- weeks ago, but he
did not know what they were talking
about. After Nolan left the kitchen the
defendant told him that Nolan had been
saying that if she would give the police
morey every week they would leave her
alone and that he would "fix" it.
- Nolan took the stand and denied mak
ing any such proposition to the defendant.
He said she spoke to him about Police
man Colen being "broke". and said the
new ones were chasing her off the street.
He advised her to move to some other
street, but she said she wanted to stay
where she was and would pay the police
men. She aked him to see the officers,
but he said: "Not after . the roasting I
got from Sylvester." He admitted that
he had asked Sylvester to "go easy" with
his girl, whose name was Lottie Myers.
She had been arrested three times In two
weeks last February, but not since. He
never knew of money . passing between
women in the "tenderloin"' and the police.
On April 20 he had mane a 'Statement to
Lieutenant Blrdsall at the Central sta
tion denying what the defendant had said
to Captain Seymour.
â¢ Detective Bainbridge was called and
testified that Nolan's reputation was bad
in the police community. He had failed
to provide fcr his family and had been
arrested for shooting at Billy Abbott.
Â¦ The Judge said that although, the
charge of vagrancy against the defendant
had been in a sense proved, she was not
a- public nuisance and he would dismiss
the case, but reprimanded her and told
her to quit her evil ways. Regarding the
alUjred ' bribery he was satisfied that so
far as Policeman Sylvester was concerned
there.' was nothing to support a charge
of such a damnable character against
him. He forebore commenting on Police
man Chappelle.:as his case might be tak
en before the Police Commissioners. Â¦ Two
years> ago he had demanded an investi
gation before the Commissioners then . In
office, but it was not granted. . Now. as an
honest" man, he supposed he would again
demand art investigation before the pres
ent board. - :.â¢Â¦'. . Â¦ â¢ . :
The trial, of . Angelina M. Abbott,
charged with vagrancy, and; incidentally
the investigation as to policemen receiv
ing money from women In the "tender
loin" were concluded before Judge'Caban
iss yesterday. The sensational develop
ments-promised by. the attorney for the
defendant did not materialize. The Judge
dismissed the charge of vagrancy and
made some remarks upon . the alleged
birbery. .-'

ON EXPORT COAL
Objectionable Measure
Is Passed by English
:v Parliament.
Miners' Federation Expected
to Issue Call for General
V : â¢ Strike. Â¦ â¢
/.LONDON, May 6.â There was an un
usual't,animation .and. attenda'nee in; .the
House of Commons to-day wifen the last
installment of the coal resolution â¢ debate
was opened by Sir Edward Gray. (Liberal),
who .defined the measure as harsh and
oppressive.* 1 The House 7 adopted | the coal
tax by a vote, of 333 to 227.; .The tax of a
shilling per ton on' export coal was adopt
ed by a majority of 1C6. These figures ap
parently do*' not represent^ the. feeling of
the members of the , House, but the Gov
ernment , Inade the \lssue, strictly a . party
one and secured the- record- attendance
for this Parliament By vigorous efforts
the Government polled .within a score , of
the /normal majority. ... *â¢ -~ "> C'.-.-'CajEi-'-W-f.
The principal figures during the last day
of' the discussion of the ,. coal'" tax were
chiefly' within the Liberal ranks. Sir Ed
/Ward Gray, H. H. Asquith, .William Abra
ham (Liberal) :and Charles Fenwlck all
assailed the tax. eloquently, -the last two
speaking -with 'no little pathos on behalf
of the; miners,: In whose station- of life
.they worked before coming to Westmin
'ter.' '-Â¦; â¢' Â¦ .Â¦'Â¦.-- V-V.V.
Government Bitterly Denounced.
% Perhaps: the most interesting feature
was the speech of Hon. Frederick Lamb
ton,, brother of the Earl of Durham, who,
standing -amid the Conservatives, de
nounced the Government as "a pack of
ravenous hounds- after a ewe lamb," by
which he referred to the coal industry.
He -declared Â¦ that â¢ the Chancellor : of r the
Exchequer had represented the colliers as
liars and foreigners, and he maintained
that they , were "as honorable a set of
men as ever sat : on the "Government
benches."
Sir Michael . Hicks-Beach attempted to
explain, but Mr. Lambton paid little heed.
.The sleepy peopde who had come In to
hear the final stages of the debate blinked
vigorously- as they heard the right of
miners to strike proclaimed by an aristo
crat, who declared that the miners were
"as good as many a man who has won
the Victoria Cress."
Another supporter of the Government,
John Wilson, bitterly objected to the tax
by bringing up the question of American
competition, and contending that the duty
would give the United, States a chance to
cut out the British coal. ..This started the
ball rolling, antt for some time the Hojrse
gave itself up to a discussion of thejjela
tive merits of "Pocahontas" and "sHioke
less Welsh," with frequent reference to
America's growing merchant marine and
the advantages of coal.
Balfour Defends Measure.
Mr. Balfour In rambling style summed
up the debate, basing his argument upon
the proposition . that such a great and
ever-Increasing industry -as the export of
coal could not be Seriously affected by the
imposition of a tax of a shilling a ton. He
dismissed as highly improbable the theory
that American coal . v/ould ever be able
to compete with English.
It; the division which followed there was
much cress voting. . John Morley voted
with the Government. . Several Liberals
abstained from voting, while almost all
the Conservatives representing coal coun
ties joined the opposition.
"What the miners' federation will do re
mains to be seen. Judging from . the
speeches of the labor members during the
last stapes of* the oebate the federation
is quite likely to [declare a general strike,
thus precipitating a struggle between or
ganized labor and Parliament. .Such a
collision, as was â¢ said frequently during
the ' debate, might prove ruinous to the
coal industry and highly injurious tO'the
country. *

DELAWARE. Ohio, May 6.â It has de
veloped here that Professor Alja R. Crook
of the Northwestern University, who re
cently declared in a lecture that he had
never kissed a woman, has had a romance.
Through relatives living in this city it
Js learned that the- guileless professor is
not only in. love," but is engaged to be
married. The happy event is to take
place, next fall. In connection with his
engagement there is told a most inter
esting story as to .how it. was brought
about. The story is vouched for by rela
tives of Mr. Crook. ! One year ago Miss
Grace Crook, a sister of the professor,
was married at her home at Portsmouth,
Ohic. The wedding was a large one and
there was the usual wedding party. One
of the bridesmaids. Miss Lulu Hyde of
Chlllicothe, Ohio, Â¦ so .infatuated Crook
that he was loth ,\o leave her after the
wedding was 'over. ; The incident naturally
led to , a closer acquaintance and finally
resulted in the engagement of the; young
couple. â¢
Miss Hyde Is a. i former student of the
Ohio Wes'leyan University of this city and
resided at Monnett Hall, which is noted
throughout the country for, its fair ten
ants- -The -widely advertised theory - of Â¦
Professor Crook that the love germ does
not thrive in . scientific atmospheres Is
thus jdisproved in-his own case. .

A piece, of villainy, which is. laid at the

Joseph Heifner, agent of the Iowa State
Insurance Company, who has taken "an
active part in running down the gang, es
timates that their depredations have al
ready cost the insurance companies $40,000.
They have so terrorized' the neighborhood
of Ardmore. a coal mining town in. the
southern part of the county, ..hat the
honest farmers dare not appear against
them, or even refuse to sign their bonds,
for fear their bams and even their, houses
may. be reduced to ashes. Practically all

from the field in ,that locality. â¢ " . N

CAMBRIDGE, Mass:, May 6.â This the
thirteenth day of the j Eastman murder
trial was spent by thedefense in piling up
additional evidence to support the conten
tion that the relations between the de
fendant and the victim of the shooting,
Richard H. Grogan Jr., were at all times
pleasant. The incidents of the fatal day
were scarcely touched -upon.
The evidence showed that the families
were at all times congenial, that. the two
men enjoyed many athletic sports togeth
er, but the sport which mostly took their
fancy was shooting at a mark.
Mrs. Eastman, wife of the defendant,
took the stand Just before the close of the
afternoon session and had not finished
her testimony when the court adjourned.

A DECISION was handed down by
Probate Judge Coffey yesterday
awarding' one-third of the $100,
' 000 estate of the late Joseph Ross
to" his granddaughter, Ethel
Ross, a miss of 12 years. The youthful
heiress is the daughter of Joseph L. Ross,
deceased, and Sophie Ross-Jensen, a resi
dent of this city. .
Joseph Ross' estate consists chiefly of
valuable realty adjoining The Call build
ing, on Third street, near Market. Ethel
Ross claimed one-third of the estate as
a pretermitted heir, not aa-vlng been men
tioned or alluded to In any way. in the
will of her grandfather, who died in this
city in October, 1S98,- leaving a will dated
March, 1898.
In this will he mentioned Ethel's fath
er, Joseph L. Ross, leaving, him $10 and
no more. JudgÂ£ Coffey found, however,
that Joseph L. Ross, the father of Ethel,
was dead at the time of the making of
the will. Attorney I. I. Brown and Gavin
McNab, who represented the child Ethel,
claimed that inasmuch . as Ethel was , a
presumptive heir to her grandfather at
the time of the making of the will- the
mere, fact that, a legacy was bequeathed
to her dead father did not prevent her
from asserting. her rights as such a pre
sumptive heir. ' The court adopted this
view and held that Ethel was a pre
termitted heir and entitled .to all the
rights a*' such, and gives her the same
share' In â¢â¢ her grandfather's estate as
though he had died- without leaving a
Will. â¢ â¢â¢' . '" I ;" Â¦
The point presented tOithe court was a
new one in California, and Judge Coffey
is the first jurist to pass upon the same
in this State.
The father of Ethel, Joseph. L.' Ross,
left California in 1888 for the State .of
Washington. He was last heard of In
Spokane during the month of July. 18S9.
During this period he wrote regularly to
his wife, and his letters were full of aÂ£
fection for both, her and little Ethel. Jo
seph L. Ross was never heard from after
Julv, 18S9, by his wife or any member of
his'immediate family.
ETHEL. ROSS, WHO WINS A
FORTUNE BY A SUPERIOR
COURT DECISION.
LONDON, May 6.â "There is not a man
in the Republican party wHo .could get
the next Presidential nomination easier
than Senator Mark Hanna, and not a fhan
In the United States who could be so eas
ily elected."
This flat-footed statement of Perry S.
Heath, secretary of the /Republican" Na
tional Committee, to a group of American
friends at the Hotel Cecil' yesterday, was 1
greeted with anything but unanimous as
sent. Â¦ â¢- ..',. '\ ; ... ,
"I know it sounds a bit' startling at
flrst," continued Heath, "but when, you
come to think it over you will agree with*
what I say. Some days before Congress ad T
journed-I -*as talking in Washington . on
the same sirbject with a number of-prom
inent politicians. One of them was. a
strong, candidate for the nomination" hinit 1
self. They, too, looked surprised at* the
suggestion, but when they came to think
it all over they agreed exactly with me."
"How about Mr. McKinley for a third '
term?" asked one of Heath's auditors.- V
"It Is most unlikely," promptly , an
swered Secretary Heath. "While Mr. Mc-Â»
Kinley has made a record for himself such
as even the greatest of his admirers and j
well wishers never dreamed of, I don't,
think that he himself would entertain for j
a moment the idea of controverting the ,
popular sentiment in opposition to third
nominations. Of course, circumstances
might arise through trade complications
and the consequent widespread foreign
interests of the United States which would
almost demand Mr. McKinley' s retention
of the Presidency, in whichevent the peo
ple would voice their demand in no uncer
tain fashion. But that is another thing.
Under normal circumstances I don't think
Mr. McKinley would entertain a thought
of renomination. Therefore, I repeat, the
strongest man for the nomination to-day
is Senator Mark Hanna. He would be the
easiest to elect."

The day was greeted' in New York with canl

fitted up by private subscription . for the us*
of the new Congress, was still In progress of

session for formality sake, so that as a vâ¢

whether. the old government was dead or thÂ«
new one alive. â¢ ' Prolonged storms, bad road,
and imperfect means of conveyance caused thÂ»
delay. â¢ The House organized at last with a

Â¦ The suspicion that the majority of the pupils of
the .common schools of Germany are inadequately
educated, since the teachers are so badly'paid^is con
firmed, by reports made by a correspondent Tof the
London Telegraph, who has studied the subject from
a pqinfof. view quite different" from .that taken" by.- the:
American correspondent. In â¢ giving' illustrations , ; of
the ignorance of the young .'men who . have had no
other than a common school education* he 'says: "A
The writer goes on to say: "It is far from my
purpose to say anything in disparagement of the
Prussian school system, for which I have the highest
admiration. The point of these remarks is that now
adays Germany is doing its best work in education
rather in spite of the present regime than by its aid."
It appears, then, that notwithstanding, a system that so
degrades the ; prof ession of school-teaching that more
than 5000 schools in the kingdom remain ..without
teachers, it is the belief of the writer that the, results
are -still admirable. It is probable a more thorough
examination might have led to a different conclu
sion, and that the critic would have riote'd , that in
justice done to the teaching, body has. had ill effects
upon the pupils. I
One of the authorities, a correspondent of the Bos
ton Transcript, says: "In Prussia alone, as was
shown in a recent Parliamentary debate, there are now
over 5000 vacancies among the teaclfers of the public,
schools â this in a country which has an abnormally
large proportion of university trained men and where
learning is a drug in the market." He attributes the
lack of teachers to the iiiggardly pay % allotted to, them
and to the scant courtesy they receive in society. A

GERMANY has for so long a time been looked
upon as the exemplar of national education
that adverse criticism of her public schools
ami their results has rarely been heard. It is there
fore worth noting that of late two writers on the sub
ject,, one American and one British, have taken that
critical attitude. In their judgment Germany gives
too much attention to universities and too little to the
primary schools, with the result that while the empire
has an oversupply of highly educated men, the in
struction given to the mass of the people is inadequate
and ineffective.

The last straw which should break the back of offi

The neglect of ' highways . is the more strange . be-,

of Agriculture' that while it costs the American farmer
anaverage of 25 cents to haulone ton one:mile;on
existing roads, it costs a French farmer only 6.8 cents
to haulone ton one mile; on ithe highways of France.
When the amount . of -that is done in an

Up to this time Massachusetts, New Jersey: and
Connecticut are the only ' States' in -the " Union thai
have seriously grappled with the problem of highway
improvement and adopted. a well devised system for
solving it. It has' been noted in those States that .the
construction of one good road leads to ' the under-;
taking. of another. The example is. said to^be,infec
tious. We have not had that experience in California.:
Some of our counties' have provided goodfroads! and
maintained them for years without having had the
effect T of rousing adjoining counties to imitate the
example. ,. ; . , . - : . .Â¦" ; ';'<.;. i V Â¦ : Â¦ :- Â¦ ;
Even in New York, where there was a well organ T
ized movement to bring about the enactment of a
measure designed to stimulate road improvement, and
wncre a definite plan was agreed upon in advance; the
result was to a considerable extent disappointing.
The plan. was to have the State issue bonds to the
extent of $5,000,006 to be used in highway^ improve-,
ments in co-operation with the counties: The" best'
that was attained was an appropriation of .$420,000
for that purpose. Even that is decidedly * better than
nothing, for in order, to obtain any part of the State
appropriation a county must guarantee in advance an
expenditure for such .improvements equal to the/
amount asked for from 'the State. Thus if x all be called'
for there will be expended upon permanent Statc\
roads in New York this year the sum of $840,000. Y
DESPITE the campaign of education on the
subject of highway improvement which has
been carried on with more or less earnestness
for several years, comparatively little was'accom
plished to promote the work during the past winter.
For one reason or another the Legislatures of , the
various States gave no heed to the demand for legis
iaticn on the subject, or else were unable to agree
upon any measure of the kind submitted to them.
GOOD ROADS MOVEMENT.
\Vhat_ Dr. Dillon . and Sir _ Robert Hart saw is ac
cepted as better testimony than the Minister's opinion
of whatf he did not see. ; .
Upon these strictly international subjects the views
of Minister Conger are of value, for he took part in
the things of which he speaks. His belief about things
he did not see nor take part in is no better than that
of any other who was not an eyewitness.
On our part this was diplomacy of the higher and
better sort, and we were the only nation present and
powerful that could indulge in the luxury of sincerity.
The others would have secretly exulted in the accom
plishment of Russia's ulterior purpose, because it gave
them an excuse for doing just what she intended
to do.
So far the United States has exerted a salutary,
conservative influence in the question of settlement
and has confused the other allies by taking their pro
fessions of justice to express their sole purpose. In
this way we ended the . Russo-Manchurian incident
and averted war between Russia and Japan. That con
flict was not settled in St. Petersburg and Tokio, but
in Washington. President McKinley and Secretary
Hay put Russia in a position where she could not
prc;end one thing and do another. Left to deal with
China alone, or Japan alone, or with the other Euro
pean allies which have the same ulterior purpose that
she cherishsd, Russia would have used the Manchu
rian convention as a sword to cut China in two. She
caied nothing for its text or apparent purpose when
dealing with her rivals or her intended victims; but
when our Government said that we would take that
convention to mean only what it said and to ambush
no other than its professed purpose, she saw that she
could not use it for its real purpose, and her interest
in China's signature at once abated.'
WITH the news expressed by Minister Con
ger in his communication to a New York
weekly the country will be pleased. The de
sire to impose no burden upon China that she cannot
carry agrees with American sentiment, which would
willingly accept guarantees for the future, coupled
with the opening of the empire-to the world, as far as
is consistent with its necessary complement, the equal
opening of the world to China, on exactly reciprocal
tenr.f.
Minister Conger develops very clearly the mutual
contentions and greeds of the European powers, and
makes it evident that they seek excuses for the stay
in China of their military forces,- pretending that con
tinued occupation is made necessary by a situation
of Chinese creation, when they are really there to
watch each other, every one intending to make, a
grab when the others are not looking. For such stay
on her soil, and for such purpose alone, they propose
that China shall pay the bill! They see that such
policy is a handy means for increasing the demand
for money indemnity to a sum that the country can
not stand, arid then making her physical incapacity to
respond an excuse for the seizure of territory and the
partition of the empire.
Those powers are making history, but they will not
write it. It will not be written in line with their pre
tenses, but in line with the facts, and the future will
judge them by what they do, not by what they profess
ard pretend.

The President is a cheerful', man by : nature; : he
thinks cheerfully and he talks cheerfully, but he knows
Americans are the least prudent of pecple, that they
are the most sanguine and ardent} and consequently
he preaches thrift as well as enterprise. Optimism
and prudence make a good combination, and it is to
be hoped most Americans will be able to combine
them with the sagacity. the President advises.
It would be weir if all Americans would heed those
words. There is nothing in them of foreboding, or
any suggestion of coming disaster, such as some men
have uttered, : nevertheless they constitute a warning
against the wild speculation now. going on in, Wall
street. In this time of. prosperity, we must prepare for
the coming of evil days. !Every worker should* save
a portion of his earnings.
Those were the words of the. optimist,' the utterance
of the patriot statesman exulting in the prosperity of
his country; but later on he said: -"What we want
to do now is to be prudent in our prosperityâ save
while we can, and be strong if the storms should come,
arid they do come now and then. Whatever comes let
us be fortified by the practice of economy while we
are all so well employed." ; ; ; . {. : ['.
At Roanoke he said: "We have never had so much
to' do in all our history as we have now. We never
had so much business at home, nor so much abroad.
"We never made so much and never sold so much as
we shall sell this year. We are expanding our mar
kets. Our productive capacity has become so great
that we are not only able to supply the home market,
but we require a foreign market for our surplus, and
so we are seeking an open 'door; in the Orient for .the
products of American soil arid American labor."
An illustration of the wisdom of his counsel is to be
found in the brief references he has made from time
to time to the abounding prosperity, of. the.country,
?.nd to the proper method oi profiting by it.. He is
an optimist, but he is not blind to the dangers of that
sanguine speculation into which prosperity is apt* to

XE- THE MAORIS OF - NEW ZEALAND.
Among the colored races with which the
Anglo-Saxon people have come in contact
there are few presenting so many features
of interest and none showing: such a re
markable advancement from savagery to
civilization as the Maoris of New Zealand.
The history, of their encounters .with the
white, invader of their country, of their
pacification, and of how they were turned
to the ways of civilization; though it ex
tends over but a brief period, is full of
picturesque Incident ' and may furnish
some useful lessons for the United , States
'in? dealing with the people of the . Philip
pines.^",. . -â .'. v ' Â¦. . *" '
Â» There is no record' of the .origin of the
Maoris. :, Tradition tells of their voyaging
,tb -'New Zealand j In canoes ' from some of
the ; Islands. of .the Pacific, and this tradi
tion Is accepted by students of the race,
the time of their coming being about 500
years ago.. When Tasman first sighted
New Zealand, in 1642, he found the na
tives numerous and fierce, and Captain
Cook gave blood-curaling accounts of
their warlike character and cannibalism
as the result cf his visits from- 1769 to
1774. In 1S09 3ixty-six white persons on
board the ship Boyd, which called on her
way from Sydney, to England, were killed
and eaten by. the. Maoris, and in 1816 the
crew of ,the American brig Agnes suffered
a similar fate. Â¦ However, the Rev. Sam
uel Marsden took a band of missionaries
to -New Zealand in 1814. He secured the
friendship of some of the chiefs, but was
unable to prevent wars among the differ
ent Maori tribes. When the first orga
nized band of British, settlers arrived, ten
years . later, the Â¦ majority of them were
frightened from the country by the sight
of a conquering tribe cutting up and eat
ing the bodies of its enemies.
The Treaty of Waitangi.
The missionaries, however, continued
their work, and through their influence
the active intervention of Great Britain
was secured, and in 1840 the treaty of
Waitangi was signed, -a great event for
the Maoris, who to this day regard . that
agreement as Lheir Magna Charta. It con
tained the Maoris' declaration of . alleÂ»
glance to the Queen and Great Britain's
recognition of the Maori ownership of the
whole of New ; Zealand. This treaty led
to a semblance of -peace and the'settle
ment of the couiftry. proceeded, but .the
difficulty of dealing with, the natives with
respect to their lands was soon apparent,
and the first bloodshed. after the signing
of the treaty was caused by a disputed
land transaction between the whites and
the - Maoris. The war lasted five years,
peace being eventually restored by the ef
forts of Sir George Grey, who secured the
confidence of the Maoris, dealing fairly
with them, paying for their lands, set
ting Â¦ up schools to educate \ their children
and train them in agriculture. Through
out the war a section of Maoris had re
mained friendly to the English and j had
fought with them against the hostile
tribes. Â¦ ' -" Â¦.'.Â¦Â¦
During the twelve years of .peace that
followed the ever-increasing- number of
white settlers in New. Zealand had many
friends among the Maoris. But the tribes
inhabiting the heart. of the north island
continued hostile, to, the British. They
had been always averse to the Maoris'
selling their land; and they had noted
with displeasure the increased power of
the white men. Meetings" were held and
it was < reso'lved that an attempt should
be made to amalgamate all the Maori
tribes under one king with a view to driv
ing the English out of the country. \ Te
Whero Whero was "chosen King and he
hoisted the Maori flag, but the movement
was unsuccessful and to this day there
has not been any union ' of the tribes.
There is. still, a Maori - king but his
. authority is acknowledged by only a sec
tion of the Maoris and he uses. his influ
ence not to drive the English out of the
country, but to secure from the English
representatives in Parliament the best
legislation possible for his people.
, " Pacification of the Maoris. -
The movement, 1 , however, was accom
panied by the formation of a land league
and the old trouble in connection with
the purchase of native lands led to war
in the TaranakI district. No sooner had
this rising been quelled than another sec
tion pf the Maoris, the Warkatos, were
In arms and a long and costly war fol
lowed. Sir George Grey, who had been
so successful in. the first war, arrived in
1861, but the Maoris were not subdued
until 1S66 and there were skirmishes up
to 1871.. v
Throughout the war Sir George Grey
had done much to break down the native
distrust of the English colonists and at
a critical time \ Sir Â¦ Donald McLean came
on' the scene as mlni%ter of native affairs.
During his seven years of office all traces
of. enmity were wiped away. Sir Donald
Mcljean understood the Maoris. , He paid
respect to their chief s and ' showed great,
tact- in the purchase of native lands. .He
employed a large. number of Maoris on
roadmaking, paying . them liberally.
Though obstiriate and self-willed in op
position, the Maoris ; have always been
easily : handled when ';Â¦ respectfully and
kindly treated, and ' Sir i Donald* was ever
their friend ;and counselor. They had
learned the value of money long before

conciliate them, â¢ while the roads opened
up the country for future settlement.
. Bapid Progress of the Natives.
There has been one, and only one, real
difficulty in dealing with them. The land
question has always been a source of.
trouble: It was the cause of much of the
bloodshed and has been the object of con
tinuous negotiation ever since, but suc
cessive governments since 1870 have
shown much patience and consideration
with Maori land owners and gradually
prejudice has given place to confidence
and 1 the Maoris to their ow.n benefit are
now leasing and selling their lands freely
to Europeans." The treaty of Waitangl
gave to the Maoris, numbering, at - the
time 60,000 or 70,000, an absolute title to
66,000,000 acres of valuable land and the
validity of the. treaty or the rights of the
Maoris to the land has never been dis
puted."
"When the treaty was signed the private
purchase of native lands was stopped, the
pre-emptive right of purchase from the
Maoris passing to the British Govern
ment, an officer of the crown being ap-i
pointed to determine -the titles. This
method . obtained until 1862, when land
courts, presided over by able Judges,
were set up to determine titles and pri
vate purchases were allowed up to 1894,
when the crown again took the sole right
of dealing with the Maoris. The Maoris
urged that they should have a greater
voice in the disposal of their land*. After
many consultations with the tribes the
present Premier, the Right Hon. R. J.
Seddon, has recently brought Into opera
tion the most'^promising land legislation
yet provided for the Maoris. The whole
control of the lands is vested In a board
partly appointed by the Governor and
partly elected by the Maoris themselves,,
provision being made for the majority of
the members being Maoris. The board
Investigates titles and' has power to sell
or lease land either- to private Individuals
or to the crown, but prior to any sale the
members of the board have to be satis
fied that the alienating Maori retains suf
ficient land for his own support.
Since the treaty ox Waitangi much land
has passed out of the hands of the Maoris.'
Since 1S70 the * Government has spent a
sum equal to $10,000,000 In purchasing na
tive, lands in the north island and prior
to that year the whole of the south Isl
and had been disposed of by the Maori
owners. There are still, however, over
10,000,000 acres owned by Maoris, of which
they cultivate only about 10,000 acres.
Present Condition of the Maoris.
The position of the Maoris to-day is in
many respects in striking contrast to that
of a quarter of a century ago. Unfortu
nately their numbers are decreasing.
There were at the last census under 40,000.
The half-caste population, now over 6000,
is steadily Increasing. To a considerable
extent the Maoris still live in communis
tic fashion, each village, cultivatng suffi
cient food for its own recfuirements, while
in their dealings with Europeans they fre
quently pool the proceeds for the bene
fit of the community. There are, how
ever, many . exceptions to this rule, and
as railways are being pushed through
their country and the opportunities for
earning and spending money in European
fashion are increased the little communi
ties are being gradually broken up. â¢
Of the marks of improvement shown by
the Maoris there is none so distinctly
prominent as the anxiety they display for
the education of their chttdren and their
instruction in the English language.
There are 4410 Maori children now attend
ing school, many of them are receiving
higher education and a few have been
graduated, at the university. There are
several Maori lawyers in the colony and
the roll of the Supreme Court contains
the name of at least one Maori barrister.
"When well trained the Maoris make ex
cellent mechanics and they have always
shown a wonderful capacity for making
roads even without engineering assist
ance.
Maoris in Government Offices.
In the last thirty years the Maoris have
returned four members to the New Zea
land House of Representatives and they
have at present two members of the race
sitting in the Legislative Council. The
present Â¦â¢ Minister for Native Affairs, the
Hon. James Carroll, is a half-caste, sit
ting for a European constituency. He Is
a persistent advocate of tlie cause of the
Maoris. For the election of the four
Maori members of the House of Repre
sentatives all Maoris over 21 years of age
have ' a vote. At the last election there
were twenty candidates for the four seats
and of a total population of 39,854 (includ
ing children), 13.628 voted. The local gov
ernment of Maori villages has until re
cently been left in the controli of the I
chiefs, but an act passed during the last
session of Parliament has created Maori
councils with a sort of mixed authority
comprising the functions of policeman,
magistrate and local board of health.
The Maoris are respected and admired
for their sterling virtues and their brav
ery. Obstinate and self-willed in warfare,
proud and superstitious In their subse
quent dealings with the British, they have
developed into a light-hearted, good-na
tured race, erratic and uncertain, it is
true, and possessing none of the charac
teristics of a progressive people, yet with
out doubt the best colored race in physi
que, in" character and in history that
could be found in the world-wide British
empire.

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS
If the Kaiser have a dream of racial integration and
believe that every German emigrant goes 'forth
branded as the bondman of the empire he is mistaken.
The race .was before the empire. It has impressed its
genius in Germanic institutions in England and the
United States, and its capacities are greater and its
aspirations freer than the artificial structure built in
its name over the German states of the continent.
But we have another expectation just as strongly
founded. It is that these same immigrants, having
healed their shoulders made raw by the burdens of
empire, will turn to us and themselves invoke the
Monroe doctrine for protection against the re
imposition of the load they have laid off.. We have
no doubt that should the Kaiser attempt to plant his
warlike banner over the Germans who have passed
from under its folds they would resent it as strongly
as our fathers did the attempt to make the British flag
an emblem of their oppression.
Americans are not migratory. We have verge
enough at home. All state-building or state-strength
ening immigration must be of the class that eats its
bread in the sweat of its face. It is manual labor that
builds or strengthens all foundations. Our- laboring
population governs at home and sees abroad no higher
opportunities than are at hand here. We could not
spud them to colonize South American countries if we
should invade and conquer them, and without such
colonization" the change would not be productive of
good. \
Since :he promulgation of the Monroe doctrine this
country has had but one wish as to Central and South
America, and that is for the planting there of perma
nent self-government. .To accomplish this we have
sent out no colonies, nor have we applied any force.
We have appreciated the racial peculiarities of the
people and have expected that these would become
less marked. by infusion of the blood of Northern
Europe by immigration.
In this expectation and desire we have no stronger
allies than the German and Scandinavian immigrants.
. Without any desire to impeach the judgment of the
Review, we must be permitted to" point out that its
ji'dgment'is misused. German migration carries with
it affection for the fatherland, not joined to any desire
to take also .German imperial institutions. The
United States has, offered, and offers still, a most in
viting field for German immigration/ and the immi
grants face hitherward to improve their condition in
our wider and'freer opportunities and to escape ; the
military burdens and bureaucratic Government which
bear heavily upon them at home. .There is surely no
evidence furnished by the German population in
North or South America that they are anxious to
bring their burdens with them. Th-ey are too tired
of packing soldiers at home to bring them on 'their
backs across the sea.
Germans will continue to settle in South America.
Thev will not go there as military colonists to over
throw existing governments and plant the empire, but
as peaceful citizens who will finally infuse German
love of law and order into the Governments they
find already planted. In the United States we owe
much to the German spirit. Our institutions have
been strengthened by their influence. The republi
can scheme of government had its germ in the Saxon
idess of order, which are the common heritage of the
German and Scandinavian races. Instead of being
jealous of the settlement of South America by those
iaccs> we" welcome it , as a guarantee of the future
suability of Brazil, the Argentine and all the greater
Governments of that continent. It means their closer
approximation to our own development, and that
they will be better neighbors and better customers.
GERMANY AND AMERICA.
THE London press is sensational in its forecast
of trouble between 'the United [States and Ger
many. â¢' "â¢ :j ' ' . Â¦
Â«^It is pretended that the opportunities for German
immigrants in South America will furnish the. issue to
be joined and fought about by the two 'countries. The
Saturday Review says that the Kaiser, "like a wise
ruler, prepares for'the future, to be found in the strug
gle for partition and exploitation of the great South
American continent." â¢ .

PERSONAL MENTION.
A country whose young recruits do not know .the
name of the founder of their nation can hardly be said
to have a good system of common school = education.
Evidently we can no. longer look to Germany.; as a
model in that form of instruction. . ' 'â¢
Some of the answers. given by those who had heard
of 'Bismarck and had some sort of notion concerning
him are f amusing-. Among them were these: "Bis
marck was the ; first German Emperor." "Bismarck
was a great; poet." "Bismarck was the instigator of
the Kulturkampf." "BismaVck was a translator of the
Bible." "Bismarck was the first company officer in
the ,war.V\ The.last answer was that of a recruit who
thought he knew all about his country and was giving
an excellent definition of -Bismarck. It ran: "Bis
marck was the Kaiser's "greatest enemy."
German lieutenant of infantry on 1 the west
ern frontier put two questions to: seventy-eight of his
recruits a ; few days after they Â¦ joined the regimentâ
and it should be remarked that the country folk on tlie
western frontier are'- somewhat more enlightened than
their' compatriots of the March of Brandenburg and
of "the eastern frontier: " The ! questions we're:" 'Who
was Bismarck?' t'Who; was -Windthorst?' ' Twerity-
of these seventy-eight yokels declared- they -had
never J heard 'of : Bismarck;; twenty-two : said he had
been. a. great general;, six "thought he Was a former
Minister. of War; and nine. pictured him to their minds
as "a celebrated leader of T armies." Five of them did^
knew.. that â¢ he was /the first : Chancellor of the empire,
a'lid'nirie indeed said, 'Bismarck founded the German
empire.'" ",. .:..'.- ,' . : :

NEW YORK, May 6.â The interrupted specu
lative advance was renewed to-day with great
violence, the speculative. holders of 6tocks^ap
parently having been entirely reassured by the
check to the reaction which was achieved on
Saturday. The urgent telling which was in
evidence Friday. afternoon not only on the part
cf forced sellers whose loans had" been called
or whose margins had .. been wiped'iout, but
cf those who feared that they would be, was
entirely lacking this' morning. Those who still
had their Ftocks held them" with determination;
while those who bad come to grief seemed to
be returning In vast hordes to make good their
losses, reinforced by <tn increasing tide of new
fcpeculators. Apparently the speculative public
was .convinced that Friday's sharp reaction
was nothing more than a manipulative dip,
designed to shake off weak holdings, which
ere a menace to an advance and to afford
great railroad capitalists opportunity to con
tinue their buying for control to better ad
vantage and at less expense. There was no
eisn of timidity lest thÂ« fame experience should
again overcome the weaker class of holders,
end the Wall-street- oistrict gave -ample -evl
cience that that- class of speculators was again
taking an active interest In the market. . The
effect of Saturday's market seemed to have
had time over the intervening Sunday to gain
great force and as a result there was a Heavy
congestion of urgent tiuying orders to be ex
ecuted at the opening. London prices before
the opening here indicated that large buying
orders in the American department . had been
executed there for London account bfore our
opening and there was reported- from London
increasing excitement on the part, of the Eng
lish speculators themselves over the American
booms. Large numbers of brokers found them
telves eagerly bidding against each other when
the chairman's hammer fell on the New York
Stock Exchange. Â« The result was J a volatile
epurt of prices which has scarcely been equaled |
in any opening during the present boom. -This
upward spurt of. prices proved in many cases
to be the highest of the day, although there
were constant recoveries and " reactions in. the
general list all day. Opening sales . were -of.
from 1000, to 23.000 share* in separate stocks' at"
extreme 'advances' of 4*4 points and^at prices
in gome instances varying as .much, as 2 points

Trunk lines and Southweetcrns proved to be
the most active stocks. - There was a continued

Fruits and Salmon in London.
1 The London Grocers" Gazette of April 20
Fays: Fruitsâ The im;>o6itlon of a duty upon
sugar has had a diEqu-eting effect upon this
snarket, and inquirers at the customs offices
yesterday were informed that the full duty of
Is 2d per cwt. would be payable upon the net
weight of the total contents of the tin or pack
age. This means a tax of, roughly, Is per
dozen upen all I'ruHts, and we learn that an
embargo has been laid upen the fruits now
landing at Liverpool from the IMrigro. The
r.ituation is an interesting one, inasmuch as of
the quantity of tiSO.000 cases (the total supplies
:-f last year's pack to this country) about
rCO.000 cases ara on th^ way, : while the Loudon
Hill, with Â£0,835, has Lven docked, but has not
yet commenced to discharge her cargo, and
about 30,000 cases are as yet in the Dirigo.
Endeavors will doubtloss be made "to Â¦ secure
th# partial or total remission of the tax as
. tar as canned goods are concerned on the
ground that the amount of sugar or sweeten
ing substance is but a tmall proportion of the
total bu!k. In Liverpool demand for apricots
L-ontinues and does nut seem to have been
checked by the Sd to <>d per dozen advancs
that has been put on the go6ds by holders. A
ilurther advance cf 6d is certain, because even
then holders are selling at considerably under
cost. Pears and peactios show a well main
tained demand at current limits.

London -Market.
NEW YORK, May 6.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: .
Activity was resumed In the markets here:to
day and the tone was improved, though consols
were flat on the announcement of a London
County Council loan of Â£2,000,000 of 3s. Home
rails were down on the apprehensions that the
miners will decide to-morrow on a universal
strike . against the coal tax. but the gist' of
opinion is that this is improbable.
Â¦ In- the American department a big business
was done although trading was confined more
or less to specialties. The feature from the
start was Northern Pacific, which, on good
buying, reported to be by the Morgan party,
was hoisted rapidly to a new record .price.
The whole market seemed to be starting on a
fierce upward career. Chicago, Milwaukee and
St. Paul bears were squeezed. New York
bought Canadian Pacific and there was heavy
local buying of Steel up -to 54% for the com
mon and 103 for the preferred. .

Demands, However, That Spe
cial Counsel R. Y.- Hayne
Be Dismissed.
Oaklaiid Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. May 6.
The offer of William J. Dingee, president
of 'the Contra Costa Water Company, to
rebate bills against the, city that funds
may be found with which to keep open
the high school was renewed to-night to
the City Council in an amended form.
The chief feature of the proposition as
amended in a resolution presented by
Councilman C. A. Bon was to dismiss Spe
cial Counsel Robert Y. Hayne, who has
had charge of the city's fight in the water
rate litigation, and to 'throw all further
prosecution of the litigation into the
hands of City Attorney Johnson. , -
As Dinpree's offer reads, the Contra
Costa Water Company is now willing to
take. as payment for the year in full ten
months' bill against the city, computed on
the \iater rates now in litigation, instead
of the rates upon which the company has
been collecting' from private consumers,
namely, the rates under the ordinance of
1S9S. .
The tender provides that the water com
pany does- not waive any of its legal
â¢rights or the claims it has presented at
the trial, and it is further provided thai
the remitted water bills for May and June
be used to keep open the high schools un
til the close of the term.
f Must Keep Schools Opan.
The resolution also requires that, the
Council shall provide money enough in
the next tax levy to keep open the schools
the full term and calls for the appoint
ment of a joint committee of the Council
and the Board of Education to determine
the amount necessary for that purpose.
The resolution opens with a lengthy re
cital of the present conditions touching
high school affairs, and then reads as loi
lows:
"Whereas. This Council feels that It Is its
duty to adopt all lawful and rightful measures
to keep the schools open and isecure tho pay
ment of the salaries of the teachers wltnout
compromising the rights of the municipality or
further crippling the usefulness of the other
departments of the city; and whereas, the
Council Is credibly informed and believes that
William J. Dingee, president of the Contra
Costa Water Company, has offered and Is will
ing to accept the amount of ten months' bills
computed on the 1900 ordinance, without waiv
ing any of the legal rights. of his company or
surrendering any of the claims It has pre
sented in the pending litigation, provided that
the sum embraced in the remitted water bills
for May and June, 1901; be ', used to maintain
and keep open the Central and High schools.
Therefore be It â¢ . . Â¦
Demands Dismissal of Hayne.
Resolved. That the City Council of Oakland
do hereby dismiss Robert Y. Hayne as special
counsel for the city of Oakland In the suit
brought by the Contra Costa Water Company
to annul the ordinance fixing water rates for
the year 1900-1901 and do hereby dispense, from
date of the passage of this resolution, with
the legal services of the said Robert Y. Hayno
from further connection with said litigation;
and be It further
Resolved. That the further conduct of said
litigation be placed in the hands of City At
torney James A. Johnson and his legally con
stituted assistant, with Instructions to prose
cute the same to a successful conclusion, if
possible, and take all proper and legal steps
to maintain the city's rights in the fullest sense
and establish the legality of the ordinance fix-
Ing water rates adopted April 26, 1900; and be it
further â¢ .
Confer With. Dingee.
Resolved, That City Attorney Johnson be
further Instructed to- confer with the officers
of the Contra Coeta Water Company to effect
some arrangement whereby the offer of Presi
dent Dingee may be accepted and the money
allotted for the payment of the water bills dur
ing the months of .May and June be imme
diately made available for the maintenance of
the High School and Central School, provided
such arrangement expressly stipulates for the
preservation ' of all the city's legal rights in
the pencing litigation, and in no wise com
promises the standing of the. municipality be
fore the courts In the case now at bar; and
be It further
Resolved, That this Council will In the next
tax levy make amole provision for the main
tenance of the schools for the full term en-
Buing in order to prevent a recurrence of the
embarrassing and scandalous deficits- which
threaten to cripple our educational system and
clve it a bad name for inefficiency and in

Rftsolved, That a committee of seven, com
posed as follows, be appointed and empowered

Four days ago Mr. Masten was in the
enjoyment of good health. He contracted
a severe cold, which finally affected his
heart. His constitution was greatly weak
ened by old age. and though every effort
to prolong life was made by his physi-
ton to the effect that the public subscrip
tion scheme to raise funds for the high
school was practically a failure. Parents
of pupils had subscribed $1150 and the pub
lic generally $600. Director Button said:
"In spite of this darkness we can see
a little dawn. I am informed that the
City Council has in mind a plan by which
the stringency may be relieved."
Pursuant to a conference with the Coun
cil a joint committee from both bodies
was appointed to-night to meet to-morrow

The committees are as follows: .From the

It is - estimated that the Dingee offer
will leave enough money to run the high
schools, giving the water company a cut
of about 25 per cent on its claims, none
of which have been paid during the fiscal
year because they were made out under
the old ordinance, and not the one which
the company is contesting. : .

Sec* 2. It shall be the duty of the Park and
Boulevard Commission to make a report to
the Board of Supervisors at as early a date
as the completeness of the report wll per
mit of such parks and boulevards as the fu
ture growth of the city and the wants of its
population may demand.
The object of the creation of .'this commission
is to secure by the disinterested and patrlotlo
efforts of the citizens of San Francisco a Â»en
erous anl comprehensive plan of parka and
boulevards which will render the city attrac
tive and beautiful in the highest degree and
worthy of the great future which the geo
graphical and commercial position of San Fran
cisco seems to promise, and at the same time
provide for places for the poor In the districts
which are now, or which are likely hereafter
to become, congested.
A resolution directing the Hospital and
Health Committee to make a list of the
premises in Chinatown which on a search
ing examination will be found to consti
tute a public nuisance, in order that the
board may direct such premises to be de
stroyed, was adopted. The resolution re
cites that in the recent efforts to clean
the district many houses have been found
to be in such condition that no repairing
can make them sanitary, and they are a
menace to the. health and lives of the peo
ple. . . .
The ordinance establishing certain ree
ulations concerning public and private
sewers was adopted.
The resolution authorizing the payment
of $500 each to Panhandle Appraisers
Kent, Raisch, Martin and Robinson was
finally passed.
The ordinance limiting the height of
buildings used for hospital purposes to
four stories, or sixty feet, and providing
that they shall be built of fireproof mate
rial upon a permit granted by the Board
of Works, was passed to print.
Maria SJaholm was granted permission
to complete a building now in course of
erection at the northeast corner of Powell
and Sutter streets to a height of fifty-five
feet on the Powell street side.

A F^d assemblage of men-about-town,
actors ar.ci bohemians, followed aii that
wp.s mortal of George A. Ginn to Calvary
Oenrnc-ry yesterday afternoon from an
uptown undertaking establishment.
. Ginn died Friday night at the City and
County Hospital from consumption, and
the news of his death quickly went the
rounds of hotois. restaurants and theaters,
where he had long been a familiar and
popular character. Probably no man
who ever lived in San Francisco possessed
a more extensive ccquaintance or added
more to the gayety of the town than
George Ginn. Years ago he was the bright
particular star of local amateur theatri
cals and afterward figured In various en
terpris3S, whee hilarity rather than pros
perity was the open sesame.
G5nn had lived in San Francisco since
his boyhood. He was born thirty-eight
years ago at Stockton and was a past
president of Seapoir.t Parlor, Native Sons
of the Golden West. It was chiefly
through his predilection for blackface
comedy that Ginn first attracted atten
tion when he came to this city. Afterward
he attained fame as the author of topical
pongs, one of which. "Darling Mabel
Merle," was sung all over the world fif
teen years ago. when negro minstrelsy
was at its height.
As a member of the old Clipper Min
strels Ginn made a reputation that
eclipsed the performances of any other
amateur in the country, and he ranked
with s=uch knights of the burnt Â«;ork as
Billy Emerson. Ralph Post, Billy Gilbert
and Charley Pierce, all of whom gradu
ated from the ranks of the Clipper Club
and afterward shone to advantage on the
professional stage.
Ten years ago George Ginn was rich,
handsome and a shining light of the ten
derloin district. A lucky Investment in
real estate at Sausalito made him inde
pendent, and he established there a resort
called the Hunter's Lodge that became

Judge Troutt manifested strong dis!n
cliration to hear the contest. He asked if

held up Kathlynne to the admiring gaze
of the spectators. The court fancied that
the child should not be taken from the
mother. Mr. Samuels insisted that cus
tody of the little girl should be awarded
to a third party, 1 He contended that the
best of reasons could be shown for such
disposition.
Judge Troutt indicated that questions
involved should be settled by the Supreme
Court. He disposed of the question fio far
as his own court is concerned by ruling
that the remarriage was a violation of the
decree of divorce and was, therefore in
valid. The writ of habeas corpus was dis
charged.
A SKIRMISH preliminary to the
pcneral battle for gtiardlanshlp of
Kathlynne Coleman, a pretty five
year old child, took place In Judge
Troutt's court yesterday after
noon. The little pirl is the child of John
M. and Mabel Coleman. The parents were
divorced February 16, 1901, and six days

ihc will of Mrs. M. A. Burdell, mother of
Mrs. Coleman. the child is a beneficiary to

Own usual interest in the proceedings for
guardianship.
The decree of divorce awarding custody
of the child to Mrs. Coleman contained a
provision that possession should go to the
fMher, provided the mother remarried
within one year after the divorce. As she
did remarry the father set about to gain
possession of Kathlynne, and made a de
monstration of armed force at the Smith
.Umicile. 92G Hyde street. As described in
The Call, he was resisted and arrested.
Fteps were taken for his release on writ
of habeas corpus.
Yesterday when the writ was called in
Judge Troutt's court Maurice V. Samuels,
representing the father, and Leonard
Stone,, speaking for the mother, sparred
for fifteen minutes. Mr. Samuels offered
to prove in two minutes that Mrs. Cole
man had remarried in violation of the de
rree, and thus establish the right of his
client to have and hold Kathlynne. Mr.
Stone maintained that there was no show-

N. K. Hasten for years was known as
a power In the financial world. He came

almost Immediately as a man of. rare

OLONEL JAMES R. DICKEY.
/T keeper of the famous roadhouse
(I . by the park that takes Us name
from him, passed away yesterday
at his home after a prolonged ill
ness. He was a native of New York and
at the time of his death was 75 years of
age.
Colonel Dickey has been a familiar fig
ure to two generations. His life in the
city, singularly enough, was spent among
the eandhills. From the early sixties to
the present time he was identified with
the roadhoifses, patronized by the men of
finance, politics and brain-workers gen
erally, who found temporary surcease
from business struggles in a drive to the
beach, with a breakfast or a lunch at
some popular wayside place.
S Born in Madison County, New York,
Colonel Dickey's youthful ambition took
him to the metropolis. Two years after
he had arrived there the discovery of gold
lured him to California. It was in June,
1850. that he arrived in this State. For
ten years he brushed against fortune and
misfortune while struggling for the at
tainment of wealth in the mines. Partial
success smiled upon his efforts, and with
a snail fortune, accumulated by the en
durance of hardships, he came to San
Frax.cisco, determined to win. Â¦ ,
San Francisco was at that time a seeth
ing, bristling, tumultuous community.
Men made money quickly, and it was
rpent with a lavish hand by those who
had hit the, nail of success on the head.
Men of means in their leisure hours drove
to the beach over the old road which now
runs by Ingleside to the ocean. Colonel
Dickey saw the possibilities of a fortune
in the establishment of a roadhouse at
the point of intersection of the road with
the beach. He built the old Ocean House,"
the first of its kind on this coast. Million
aires made this place famous in the old.
days. Within its four walls at one time
or another the bonanza kings, the spec-'
ulators and the gay, strong men of the
early days supped and drank in effervesc
ing wine to a life that was full of ex
citement and struggle. Colonel Dickey's
cuisine and wines became- famous.
First Racetrack Built.
Ills natrons were all men of endeavor/
Many of them owned horses of speed ond
blood. Colonel Dickey himself, was an ad
mirer of horseflesh. After a few years of
this life he conceived the idea of building
a racetrack In the vicinity of his road .re
sort." Close to the Ingleside track of to
day he constructed a half-mile racecourse.
It was on this track that the famous Nor
folk and LodI met, the first race of ac
knowledged thoroughbreds in the - far
West.
A defect in\ title drove Colonel Dickey
j away from the old Ocean House In 1865.
Colonel Dickey moved to Calistoga, where
be cenducted " a hotel I adjoining - the
springs. This proved but 'a slow, uncon
genial venture and his return â¢ to : . San
J Colonel Dickey, in company with Harris
r R- Covey, J. N. Killip and Charles M.
y Chase, built the Bay District racecourse
L in 1874. It was by all odds the finest rac
. ing grounds which had been constructed
in California up to that time, and not
â¢ many in the' United States were nearly
its equal. The Ocean View track, on
s which of the first of the $20,000 purses,
j heats of four miles, running, were run,
had become sadly dilapidated, and that at
its best was far from being suitable for a
' metropolitan racing ground.
; A half-mile track' on the Point Lobos
road was the only harness racing place
1 on that side of the bay, and while the
; track at Oakland was good in itself/the
appointments were inferior. The trip
across the bay was a great drawback, and
the Treat track, where Occident and Lucy
trotted, was still farther out of the way
and subject to the same objections.
* A ereat many of the wealthy men of
San Francisco in those' days were fond
of driving, but the Point L<Jbos road was
the only ground on which that taste could
be gratified, and the roadhouses along the
route were, not very satisfactory. /"Â¦'.â¢ >
The projectors of the Bay District were
well aware that a really first class place
2 would bring liberal success, and planned
accordingly. The track was ' expensive to
construct among the sand hills, where j
deep cuts and corresponding fills had to
be made. Quite a hill inside the limits
, had. to be cut down in order -not to. ob
struct the view. Hundreds., of Chinamen
moving the hill . into low places was a
queer sight to visitors lately arrived from
the East..,; The top. coating to cover.- the
sand had to/ be hauled from a distance,
â¢ and when course, grand stand, clubhouse,
hotel and stables were completed a large
sum was invested. The estimate that the
wealthy, .people of San Francisco' would
aid- the enterprise .was based on good
grounds. A > club was organized with a
membership fee of $500, and more than a
hundred signed the roll.
Popular. Boniface. Â£
Colonel Dickey waÂ» a potent element in
securing members. His capacity as a ca
terer was of the highest order. Urbane
and accomplished in the art of -pleasing
an old-time resident of California and ac
quainted .with nearly all the prominent
men of the State, his department of .the
partnership â hotel and clubhouseâ was
conducted in 'the best manner. His asso
ciates were capable and the place was
thronged with visitors from the day of
the opening. - Â¦ . â¢ t
Safe to say that the Bay District As
sociation contained more very, wealthy
men than any o^her company of a like
character in this country. It was the
very first club in . the .United : States to
place all the officers on the . salary list.
: Permanent judge, secretary, superintend
ent," clerk of Â»the, course/ etc.; were paid
liberally and the money, was allowed for
purses and premiums on a' generous scale.
With s the ' exception of the Â¦ first - of the
series at Ocean' View, 1 all- the big $20,000
and $30,000 purses," heats - of .four/ miles,
were seen on the Bay District. -and the
largest purses and stakes 'for trotters in
California were decided on that track. v 
; Colonel < Dickey was the' only one con
nected with the Bay District from' the day
of the opening Â¦ until it was : closed and
was the .last survivor, though â¢ the oldest
of the partners. Â¦- . . â¢/- 'Â¦.
: i\I*ast of the Old Roadsters.
; With' the .'death of .Colonel Dickey tho
last of the "old roadsters" have passed
away. In the prime of his -days Dickey's
name stood for many things and its very
sound awakens in the minds of the old
millionaires ; memories of dinners \ and en
tertainments which 1 cost thousands of dol
lars. It is said that on* special 1 occasions
when the drivers "of 'thoroughbreds had
J gathered at the old Bay District Dickey's
sheds covered. $150,000; in horseflesh, while
the owners .- on the inside made merry
j with the fleeting hours.- There'is no more
of this. now. The bicycle and. the street

resorts. The old-timer -behind, a span of

j leal influence met" in social soirit and
congeniality. Here men sat down Most

Nearly every regular patron owned one or
more fine horses. Differences of opinion,
would arise and nothing would settle mat
ters but a. race. *Â¦ . --. v .< â¢
A . few. years ago Colonel Dickey''pro
posed^a: scheme to the Park Commission- :
ers and it was all but. consummated. At
the end of the speed track, alongside the
line of sheds he planned the erection of a
park resort.. This .was to . be his last Â¦ ven

' Kinyoun : at this point, beaming' with
satisfaction, asked for a dismissal, and
De Wolfe consenting. Justice Rodden set
the ex-quarantine officer at liberty.
Sergeant Jordan, ' of the regular army,
testified that he -was stationed at Angel
Island last November, and that on the
day 'mentioned by De Wolfe a prisoner
had . escaped from the military prison.
Guards "were sent, out to search" for. the
escaped . soldier,*- and at , dusk a man was
seen working 'from the shore in a small
boat. : Failing to stop when , called upon,
the sergeant. had given orders to flre, but
fortunately, the men missed their mark.
De Wolfe got away from the bullets, and
the : escaped soldier was captured shortly
afterward. ''.'". : .
Â¦ "Oh, that's all right," replied Constable
Agnew, " "but you are not on your own
ground now, and bluffs don't go here. I
have a warrant for your , arrest, and I
propose to take you to San Rafael and
produce you in court." -
The Constable meant business, and the
"man of microbes" had to submit. When
the party reached San Rafael, Justice
was sitting in court. ' Klnyoun
â¢was arraigned and entered a plea of "not
guilty," and the evidence was . then taken.
De Wolfe, the complainant, is a deaf
mute, and he gave his evidence in the
sign language. He told how he had been
fired at a number of times while sailing
near the quarantine ground last Novem
ber,, but could not. identify 'Kinyoun as
the man who fired the shots.
"I am a government official," said Kln
youn,-"and you have no power to touch
me. I defy you to put me under arrest."
Hearing that Kinyoun intended to leave
for the East to-night. Agnew sent word
to ' the Police Department in San^Fran
clsco to arrest him. ".The doctor, thinking
discretion the better part of valor, start
ed ; out yesterday morning to face the
music and took ' the boat . to Tiburon, in
tending to give himself up. At Tiburon
ferry, . Constable Agnew made Kinyoun
his prisoner, despite the protest of the
doctor. .
â¢ The complainant charged that Klnyoun
had flred a number of shots at him, last
November, while he (De Wolfe) was)sail
ing in the vicinity of. the home for.bu
bonic plague microbes maintained by
Kinyoun at Angel Island.
Constable 1 George Agnew attempted to
arrest Kinyoun on Sunday last, but the
doctor refused : to . leave Angel Island,
and warned Agnew that he was trespass
ing on Federal ground and would get into
trouble if he did not go away. This con
versation was held over the' telephone
running from the wharf at Angel. Island
to the doctor's house.

Appeal Is Made to Supreme
Â» Court to Compel a New .
A : remarkable case was^argued \ before
the Supreme Court in bank - yesterday,
when;the attorneys appearihg'for. George
Aldrich asked; that Judge" Troutt ' of ~the
Superior Court be compelled to pass upon
the mental .'standing Â¦ of .their client, ; who
many years ago was adjudged insane', but
who has; enjoyed the freedom accorded ;to
ordinary people for the last ten' years and
is to ' all appearances in full possession of
his mental faculties. ' > : . ' . . V
' Aldrich's parents .were Hawaiians and
related to"], the famous Queen Lilioykalani.
His father acquired a large fortune in the
management' of various - sugar interests
and at ; his â¢ death devtded, his property
.equally among the children. George Aid
rich was , at the, time considered Insane
by his father, and his share of the prop
perty.was-placed' under the trusteeship' of
.his brothers sisters. Â¦ .",-' * .-'
â¢ In 18S8 Aldrich was adjudged, insane by
Judge Hamilton 'of "Alameda and; com
mitted to- the Napa Insane Asylum. ;' H-3
escaped from the asylum and was brought
back, . only, to /escape " again. '-^ Since,
he has been- living in* various- sections of
the country, in " the full enjoyment of his
freedom.; An effort to. establish his sahity r
v.'as made once before and the examining
physicians ' reported favorably, but I Aid
rich In a sudden fit jof anxiety wrote to
the Judge, offering a large amount of
moneys for the. desired decision, and the
case fell. through. , ' .- ->....
: The applicant has $150,000 In his own
right and a: strong desire. to spend It, but
at: present he receives only such an
amount as . seems \ best " to his relatives.
Judge Troutt, in a previous hearing of
the case, decided that he had no jurisdic
tion in the matter, and suggested a writ
of Habeas corpus. As no one. has posses^
sion of the person of the prisoner, how
ever, there is no foundation for such pro
ceedings. In this dilemma Aldrich's at
torneys, Woodworth & Spotswood, re
quested a writ of mandate to compel
Judge Troutt to hear and. pass upon the
case. The court ordered the case present^
ed on briefs within ten days, v
Attorney Spotswood. who is also guard
ian of Aldrich, says' that his clientis sane
ana has the testimony of prominent phy
sicians to that effect. Aldrich lives at a
fashionable hotel and moves in good so

There < is^ a probability t also that several
other distinguished gentlemen will occu^
py cells in* the' Alanieda' jail for the: same
.offense if the- courf*. thinks .wfell of a sug
gestion' made 'yesterday in court by. At
torney .E. S. 'Pillsbury. Mr. Pillsbury
called the attention of Circuit Judges Gil
bert, 'â Ross : and .Morrow tp the fact 1 that
others were equally guilty with Judge Du
bose, . namely, * United States District
,Judge~Noyes, Thomas J. Geary, â¢> Lawyer
Hume- and United States District Attor
ney. "Wood: of Alaska. . Â¦ "
Mr. Â» Pillsbury- suggested thatthe testi
mony, taken, in. the "contempt .cases
showed 'that Judge Noyes of the District
Court of Alaska had issued an injunction
after â¢ the writ of supersedeas had been
issued by the United States Circuit Court
of. Appeals, thereby violating the writ,
and that inasmuch as the coiirt had found
Judge Dubose guilty of advising Comp
tois, Mr. Geary was also equally guilty
and so was Mr. Hume. "United States
Attorney "Wood had the keys to the vault
containing the gold dust, the subject of
the writ, and refused to give them up,
which refusal compelled the United States
Marshal \ to break the locks forcibly. Â» Mr.
Pillsbury said that he did not desire to
make Â¦ any .motion; - he simply suggested
that this condition of .affairs existed, and
the court took . the matter under.advise
ment. Â¦;â¢ â¢â¢Â¦ , '.' ' Â¦ . ' .,
The opinion of the court In the case of
the contempt of Judge Dubose was .writ
ten by Judge Morrow.; The following are
extracts dealing with -the salient points:
It is charged in this case that Dudley Du
bose Esq., one of the attorneys for the ap
pellee. O. Jose Comptols, . on the 15th . day of
December, 1900, at Caoe Nome, Alaska, . advised
the said Comptols to alsobey and to refuse to
comply i with a certain order and writ of su
persedeas issued out of this court on the 29th
day of August. , 1900. by direction of one of â¢ its
Judges. ' Â¦" -,.
Gist of the Opinion. v -_
This is one of several : cases ' wherein Arthur
H. Noyes, .District Judge -for the district of
Alaska, Second Division, . appointed Alexander
McKenzie receiver. to take charge of and man
age, mine and ; work - certain placer mining
claims on Anvil Creek In the Cape Nome min
ing district. .â¢: Â» â¢â¢ -. . - . â¢â¢',
â¢ The testimony -in support of ' the charge ofi
contempt shows 'that the respondent declared)
that he advised his clients not- to obey the?
writs, of the' Circuit Court of Appeals and that
he would continue to give that advice. â¢ â¢ â¢
These writs . were "all disobeyed â¢ by Receiver
McKenzie and the plaintiffs in all j the cases
appear to have acted in concert in supporting
his disobedience; in other words, it is appar
ent that there was a. general harmony of pur
pose: on the part of the plaintiffs in all the
cases wherein McKenzie was â¢ appointed re
ceiver to resist the authority of the Circuit
Court of Appeals in granting appeals and
awarding I writs of supersedeas. ? * . * -
There can be no question as to the right of
an attorney, to advise his- client as to the va
lidity of an order" of court or of a writ issued
under its authority,: where ' such - an order or
writ affects the' client's Interests; and If; after
investigation;* it is the attorney's honest belief
that such order or writ Is Illegal anÂ«J*void his
advice to that effect Will not render him liable
for an error of. Judgment. But an attorney
cannot go beyond the right to- advise, and,
actuated by a spirit of resistance, - conspire
with' his client, or with others, to disobey an
order of court, obstruct the due administration
of the laws and bring the authority of a court
of justice Into contempt.. *,*.*" '
- Point in Dubose'sujTavor.
i- There Is but one conclusion to be drawn from
such, proceedings, and that is that the ap
pointment of a receiver to work and mine the
placer claim owned by the defendant was the
beginning and the end of the cause of action.
It is to be said in favor of the respondent,
however, and in mitigation of his punishment,
that the testimony, shows that when" the dep
uty marshals .arrived at Nome . on October 15,
1900. to execute the writ of supersedeas the
respondent expressed himself as regretting that
he had misapprehended < and misconstrued the
writ, and ' he thereupon advised * obedience to
its" requirements. This fact will be given its
full weight in the judgment of the court.'. â¢ â¢
â¢ It is, therefore, considered v and adjudged that
the respondent did ' commit'; contempt of â¢ this
court as charged, and for the contempt so com
mitted it is now ordered and adjudged that he,
the said Dudley Dubose, be imprisoned in the
County Jail of Alameda | County,' California,
for the period of six months. The Marshal will
execute this - judgment. â¢â .-Â¦: Â¦.

Waiters in French Rest

Wholesale Dealers Also May
Â¦ . Become /a. Factor in
\ Controversy.
All kinds of statements are being made
by those concerned in -the controversy be
tween the cooks arid waiters on the one
har.d and the restaurant proprietors on
the other. 7-r â¢'
As predicted by The Call yesterday,
three more kitchen crews left their work
during the day. but they were early re
placed by others. Both sides . still seem
confident of ultimate victory. Both the
Restaurant Keepers' Association and the
Cooks' and Waiters' Alliance met last
night In their respective headquarters and
discussed the situation.
Numerous restaurants throughout the
city are closed through the inability of the
proprietors to secure the requisite help.
It is claimed on behalf of the restaurant
proprietors that they are willing this
. should be so, in order that a lesson might
be taught people who are compelled to go
bungry. On the other hand, the waiters
and cooks claim that it is due to the in
ability of the employers to secure needed
help.
No definite conclusions were reached at
the meetings held last night. Matters of
detail merely were considered. The situ
ation Is not 'satisfactory to the diner out.
In many restaurants the service is bad,
and in others there is none at all. In
Bome, particularly those places having
union cards in their window^, the num
' ber of persons appearing during the busy
hours of the day is so great that the
waiters cannot attend to them.
A peculiar phase of the controversy is
the "French" restaurant proprietors.
Every effort is beins made to bring out
the employes of these places. Many have
joined the union, but so far the French
i restaurants have not been Involved In the
present embroglio. In an endeavor to in
volve the waiters in these places in the
strike some drastic measures may be at
Â¦ tempted.
Much depends on the possible action of
the wholesale dealers in the matter of
eervlng their customers. If they decide
not to supply union houses and their men
refuse, through union principles, to deliver
goods to non-union houses, an issue will
arise that will Involve more than those
who are concerned at present.
No action has as yet been taken by the
executive committee of the Labor Coun
cil looking to a general boycott

CHINESE SLAVE GIRL
CAFTTJBED OUT A BOAT
Taken to a Steamer by Tines High
binders and Concealed. Under
Some Blankets.
A Chinese fe'irl, apparently not more
than 17 or 1? years old. was captured
early yesterday morning by Chtaese In
spector John Endicott Gardner and Dep
uty United States Marshal Delanoie. The
girl had been taken from. Chinatown by
three highbinders and placed on board the
steamer Pride of the River, which was to
start for Stoeiiton at 11 o'clock yesterday
forenoon. The action of the highbinders
was observed by some white persons,
who notified Miss Lake at the Chinese
Methodist Mission. Miss Lake telephoned
to Jnspector Gardner, said the inspector
at once secured the services of Deputy
Marshal Delancie and visjted the steamer. .
They found the pirl secreted in the cook's
room under a pile of blankets.
The girl was taken to. the Methodist
Mission, where she admitted to Inspector
Gardner that she had neither been born
nor registered in this country and had
been landed here several years ago. A
charge of being unlawfully in the country
was preferred against her. She gave her
name as Tsoy Shim.
