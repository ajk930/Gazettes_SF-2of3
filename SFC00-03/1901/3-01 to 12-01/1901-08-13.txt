ters and Pittsburgh iu particular are very
orderly, however. The strikers at Canal
Dover, Ohio, have had men watching tha
mills since 2 o'clock this morning: on the
strength of a report that non-union work
ers were to be brought there. Superin
tendent Harris of the tlnplate mill has

over the showing of last night, and their
prospects for further accessions at both
McKeesport and ' Wheeling during the

Joliet and Bayview in refusing to come
out and their failure to secure any .re-,
crults in the Carnegie group throughout
the KisKimlnetas Valley and in the big
plants at Youngstown ~ and Columbus,-
Ohio, 'have been marked by disappoint
ment to them. ' They are keeping up the
fight, however, in a spirited manner, and
claim. that they have' strength in reserve
which will surprise their opponents. They
assert that they have gained a foothold
In the Carnegie mills in this city and that
at .the time desired the men will come out.
They 'are pressing their g advantages at
McKeesport and Wheeling and their or

cities. ;' President Shaffer has decided to
personally visit Wheeling and will go
there Wednesday to address a mass meet

to-morrow here directing the fight and
conferring with his associates as to plans

P1TTSBURG, Pa., Aug. .12.â The
struggle ; for mastery between
manufacturers and men in the
steel' industry is Â¦ now; fairly
launched; and on the first show
of "strength advantage is with the former.
The general strike order issued by Presi
dent Shaffer of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation has so far been obeyed by only
about 14,000 men, according to the best
figures obtainable here. The first two
preliminary calls were answered by about
45,000, men, so that the total number now
out is In the neighborhood. of 60,000.

â¢ The men who are directing the fight in
the ficld.for the steel corporation and its

cation iof; their plans for the future, and
would only discuss the situation gener
ally. A statement alleged to have been
given out officially at noon was repu

showed that the Carnegie" group,- South
Chicago, Bay View, Jollet, Youngstown,
Columbus, the Klskimlnetas Valley group,
.Wellsville and . Monessen works were
movlrig along, lull handed. Bellaire, their
advices showed, was badly crippled, but
had held on until 5 o'clock in. the after
noon and would be started up again to
morrow^ They admitted the loss to-day
of the National rolling mill at McKees
port, which they had expected to hold,
and that the Boston mill and Mononga
hela Steel Works at McKeesport and the
Republic and Elba here were tied up.
Their tube works at ft-cKeesport and here
were still at work, but menaced by a
possible "shortage of material. Their tube

' nace and coke men there were at work,
and their steel men there showed an in
clination to stay on unles intimidated.
They Â¦ also . claimed that many of their
men at. McKeesport desired to Work but
were being terrorized by the disorderly
element. They also charged that many of
their men -.were being frightened from
their places in Wheeling, and insisted that
adequate protection for the men_ there
would insure continued operations. It was
: also stated.- by the steel officials that
Clark's mill here was moving along with
its non-union crews' engaged last week,

It is" improbable also that Captain Lem
ly. judge advocate of the proposed court
of inquiry, will ask the Government for
assistance in handling the case.
Speculation has been indulged in lately
at the Navy Department as to whether
Admiral Sampson will be represented by
counsel in the forthcoming Schley court
of inquiry, and whether Judge Advocate
General Lemly will call on -the Govcrn
ment:for legal assistance in handling the
case.". Examination of the law in the
premises elicits the fact that Admiral
Sampson is not entitled to legal repre
sentation at the hearings of the court.
From an official view point Admiral
Sampson does not figure in the inquiry
at all.
Admiral Sampson has been in poor
health ever since the Spanish war, and It
Is not expected that he will be again as
signed to duty. He will remain on â¢ watt
ing orders until his retirement next Feb
ruary. Acting Secretary of the Navy
Hackett said this afternoon that he did
not know whether or not Admiral Samp
son would be ordered to Washington as a
witness before the Schley court of in
quiry. The 'admiral's testimony will be
very important.ftut it is possible that his
health will be" such as to make it Impossi
ble for him to appear before the court in
person, in which event his testimony
might be secured by sending interroga
tories to his home.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 12.â The State De
partment has received a cablegram 1 - from
Special Commissioner Rockhfll at Peking
.reporting that the draft of .the final"-pro
tocol has been agreed upon. tariff of 5
per cent ad valorem will v be "put in
force two. months after ths.slgning-af the
final protocol excepting on goods shipped
within ten days after signing, and will
continue until the conversion to specific
rates has been effected 'by the expert
commission. The Chinese free list will in
clude rice, foreign cereals, and flour, gold
and silver bullion and coin. This inclu
sion of flour in the free list is of much
importance," particularly to Pacific Coast
shippers.
Rockhill's advices that cereals and flour
have been included in the free list of the
new Chinese tariff is regarded as an im
portant provision owing- to the growth of
American exports of wheat and flour to
China. In 1899 these amounted to $2,298,023.
which was almost double the shipments
of the- preceding year. The trade has con
tinued to increase and the Pacific Coast
interests have looked forward to supply
ing China with a considerable part of her
consumption of wheat and flour, most of
which heretofore has gone from Atlantic
ports around the Horn. Recently the com
mercial organizations on the Pacific Coast
forwarded representations to Washington
showing that a 5 per cent effective tariff
on -flour would work considerable injury
to this trade. It appears now from Rick
hill's dispatch that the 5 per cent tariff
on this article has been wiped out, and
hereafter it will go to China free of duty.
The American shipments of rice and the
other articles mentioned are not very
large, and the inclusion of rice on the
free list -is chiefly due to China's need
of this staple food. J s
Owing to the frequency of drouth and
famine in China the local product of rice
often has been curtailed, .and it has been
necessary to meet the tremendous demand
by allowing rice to come In free of duty
from Slam and other rice producing coun
tries. * .--..

NEWPORT. R. I., Aug. 12.-ThÂ©
Constitution covered the triangu
lar course -of thirty miles-to-day
in 33 seconds less time than the
Columbia. .The champ'Ion of '99,
however, wins the race on time allowance
by about thirty seconds. No corrected
time can be given, as the boats have not
yet been remeasured as requested. In
previous races the Constitution had.al
lowed the Columbia one minute and
seventeen seconds. What change in meas
urement the new rig of the Constitution
will necessitate Is not known, but it is es 7
timated that she now allows the old boat
only a few seconds less time, if any..
The finish to-day was. the noteworthy
and only exciting feature of the contest.
When within a mile of the line the Con
stitution made a short tack that undoubt
edly lost her the race. Both boats were
coming in close hauled on the starboard
tack, the Constitution fully two minutes
in the lead. The light wind had headed
them a bit and it was found that 'they
could not fetch between the- committee
boat and the lightship.. .The Constitution
was pointing fairly- well and making good
speed, with a number two jib topsail. The
Columbia, with a similar jib topsail, was.
also- coming fast, 'directly astern and for.
the. last forty minutes had been .slowly
creeping up. But the line was now near
at hand, and, barring mistake, the Con
stitution looked. a sure winner, well with
in the allowance. .Not willing to leave
well enough alone,*' nowever, Captain
Rhodes suddenly put the ' Constitution
about on the port tack, crossing the Co
lumbia's bow and immediately tacked
again. .â¢ :'Â¦' Â¦ - ".
While the new boat's sails were^ twice*
shaking in stays the Columbia, with a
good full, still on the starboard tack,
A quick change was made from the
large jib topsail to the baby, and for a
few minutes- Captain Rhodes worked up
on the weather quarter of the Columbia.
Captain Barr could not come about, ao
both :boats overstood the mark. Captain
Rhodes -slowly -coming down on- his
weather and thus regaining part Of his
lost advantage. Suddenly the Constitu
tion put about and made for the line. /The
Columbia followed at once, but the new
boat having a better speed at* the time
.was quicker in stays .and 'was well away
while â¢ the:- old - boat, was tacking. She
luffed: under the bow of. the. committees
boat' exactly a minute ahead, of the Co-,
lumbia. But she had started twenty-seven
seconds -ahead, and thus in actual Â¦ tinio
'beat the old boat : only thirty-three sec
onds. '-.-â¢-Â¦ / Â¦â¢-Â¦;.â¢ j ..-â¢â¢â¢ - .;Â¦ - Â¦
Mr. Duncan said on coming ashore that
: he thought the Constitution would allow
the Columbia about one minute and five
seconds on. the new measurement, which
would give the race to the Columbia, by
about thirty seconds. Â¦â¢â¢Â¦
was bowling along at good speed, headed,
only a few hundred yards- to the lee of
the line. Â¦ The short time that the Con
stitution was gathering headway -after tha
last tack the Columbia reached through
her and went ahead, though still slightly
in, the lee of the new boat. It was an
exciting , moment and. every eye was
Â¦strained *to watch what promised to be. a
finish full of % sensation. Nor could the
Constitution fetch the line.
The Minneapolis Times says: "Europe
must be given no pretext for, interference,
for -."that would "-. mean a foothold
and an opening that might com
pel : us - either to abandon all
pretense of solicitude for republi
canism in South America or entangle us
in serious complications with England or
Germany. A show of authority now will
be the best preventive of grave trouble
later on.'-'/ . .
The St. Louis Republic agrees with
the Herald that no European power can
safely be permitted to take priority of
the United States in a course of inter
vention. At the same time the Republic
does not see that the time has arrived
for" a coercive- demonstration, either aa
interference with the domestic affairs of
Colombia, or as a prohibition of Vene
zuela's action.
Cannot .Permit Intervention.
The Buffalo Courier says of the situa
tion in Colombia and Venezuela: "With
revolutions in progress and recognized
war between two countries imminent, the
contingency" of European intervention
must be seriously considered. American
interests , must, of course, be protected,
as far as they can with justice claim
protection, and foreign intervention to
the extent of seizing South American ter
ritory certainly cannot be permitted, if
deference is given to the- sentiment of
the American people, irrespective of par
ties." - .
lutely necessary to prevent European ac
quisition of territory or the seizure of

American republics."-
mated Association will probably make an
exhaustive investigation of the action
taken by the lodges at South Chicago,
Bayview and Joliet, in refusing to make
the strike. President Shaffer has been
urged to go West and personally inves
tigate the matter, but it is unlikely that
he will be able to spare the time for the
present. A radical element in the local
lodges bitterly denounces the .Western
members and insists that there was
something irregular about the 1 matter.
Others intimate that influences that would
not bear investigation were used on the
men. It is claimed that a canvass made a
week ago showed a majority in favor of
striking, and that no reasonable explana
tion of the change of front has been
made. President Shaffer refrains from any
direct criticism of the action of the West
ern men, but it is known he deeply re
grets the loss of their support. He says
that he will await official reports before
acting, and that he can do nothing until
he returns from Wheeling. He is to be
accompanied to Wheeling by Rev. Charles
H. Fitzwilllam of Atlantic City, who will
also address the strikers. The two were
close friends when the strike leader was
in the ministry. .
DYNAMITE BOMB
WRECKS SALOON
Captain Sycamore, who is to have abso
lute charge of the Shamrock II in the
races, gave it as his opinion that the Co
lumbia Is a better boat than the Constitu
tion. . , â¢ â¢Â¦ .
"We know what the Columbia can do
We pretty nearly know v/hat Is expected
from the Constitution. The latter has not
yet beaten the time of the Columbia orran
average of six minutes, and, speaking for
myself, I do, not hesitate to say that she
must exceed that average throughout if
she is to beat the new Shamrock.""-
Captain William Matthews, the com
mander of the Erin, said: Â¦. . ' . -.â¢Â¦'..
Â¦ "We fear the Columbia more than we
do the^ Constitution. The limit has been
reached^ beyond any doubt, ; and : few
aboard believe that the Herreshoffs have
succeeded in making any noticeable im
provement upon the Columbia. The Con
stitution will doubtless be selected to
meet the Shamrock II because really she
has not had a. lair test of her ability,' and
Is likely to do better toward the end of
the^ season. Every big racing yacht does
better during- her second season, or to
war Â£ .the end of her first .year. The Co
lumbia is at her best now. She will never
again be as fast as she is now. It re-
m Â£Â« *Â£Â° , scen . lf the Constitution can
whip the Columbia repeatedly and con
sistently in all kinds of weather. Person
ally .1 doubt that she can."
Hardly had her anchor hit the bottom
of a Tompkinsville bar before throngs ap
peared on the hill and the pierheads to
study her. lines with their glasses.'
Captain. Hamilton, navigating officer of
the Shamrock, stated â¢ to a Gall corre
spondent that the yacht had been : towed
about two-thirds of the way from the
Azores. Prevailing winds from the south
southeast gave them 'a fair wind all the
way. They got into the tall end of an
easterly gale August 4 and carried away
two topsail sheets. That was the only
mishap of the voyage. The total length
of the voyage was 3769 miles and the
actual running time 14 days 9 hours and 45
minutes. Â¦ Â¦ . - . .-

Her spars are ready and there will be no
delay In getting her into racing trim. The
challenger received a lively and enthusi
astic welcome from every craft in the
harbor as she came up the bay intow of
the tug Robert Haddon. The skippers of
the 1 tugs loosed their whistles and the
New York wailed a salute with her siren.
The. Erin acknowledged the salute' with
three deep blasts.
One glance was sufficient to convince
the experts that Watson-had built a much
handsomer boat than the, old Shamrock
She looks the fastest boat ever turned out
in British waters. One of her beauties is
Watson's peculiar tilt of the counter.
There is no flatness or tumble-home along

STRUGGLE IS ON.
Continued From Page One.
LONDON. Aug. 12.â At to-day's session
of the South African Condensation Com
mission Newton Crane, counsel of the
American claimants, submitted the Amer
ican claims.
Dr. A. F. Conroy of Chicago, a member
of the Red Cross Society, asks for Â£7000
for losses of surgical instruments, horses
and wagons. A. J. Gievener, formerly of
Galveston, Tex., now stranded in Saxony,
went to South Africa In the capacity of
assayer and was deported from. East Lon
don. He asserts he is ruined in health
and fortune and wants Â£10,000. He makes
his claim in a letter to President McKin
ley, with whom, he says, he fought in the
Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War.
S. J. Ahrtug of Brooklyn, who was ex
pelled from Bloemfontein, requires Â£800
for the loss of his grocery and goods.
' Anna Wedeking of Brooklyn claims Â£134
for deportation and loss of employment
in the capacity of cook.
Nine miners claim various sums for de
portation. They were accused of com
plicity in the plot against Lord Roberts.
Crane said the claims were made in be
half of the United States Government.
Chairman Milvaln said he thought no
allowance could be made except for legal
claims. Something possibly might be
given to others as an act of grace, but
the Foreign Office has laid down the prin
ciple that the military authorities had
power to expel any one hostile or lncon*
venlent.
Crane objected to this view and pressed
the commission for a clearer exposition
of its powers.
The chairman somewhat testily told
Crane he must not interrogate the Com
missioners.
Crane divided the claimaints into three
classes â those deported for causes other
than the plot against Lord Roberts, those
wrongfully deported and those accused
of complicity in the plot. He objected to
the term "act of grace" used by Chair
man Milvain, saying it was an act of
diplomacy for the preservation, of the
comity of nations. If in diplomacy an
Embassador was told bis Government's
representations were only considered as
an "act of grace" it might be dangerous.
Less than that had produced war.
Sir John Ardagh, the representative of
the Foreign Office, contended that Dr.
Conroy's expedition was composed of
men who threw away their Red Cross
badges and joined the fighting Boers. Sir
John read a letter from Lord Kitchener
asserting that the acts of the main claim
ants justified their arrest, the accusation
of complicity in the plot against Lord
Roberts and their -deportation as unde
sirable persons. Â¦
The American claims - will be further
considered to-morrow.
Philbin telegraphed for Assistant Difc
trict Attorney Osborne to-day and the
latter came from Great Barrington. where
he had gone for a month's vacation. Phi!
bin gave him Whitney's statement made
on Saturday and Osborne went right bacx
to the country with it. He will give Phil
bin his opinion of it.
After Whitney and Burgdorf had been
again placed in the Tombs the warden In
structed his deputies not- to allow any one
to interview Whitney. For two days past
Whitney has been talking freely.
District Attorney Philbin was asked this
evening if he would request Governor
Odell to give him a special Grand Jury.
He thought he would not. but he had a
conference with the foreman of the Grand
Jury during the day. By'saying the Grand
Jury had found indictments in gambling
cases on evidence submitted he hinted
that the present Grand Jury might take
charge of any cases arising from the pres
ent excitement. Eighteen indictments
were found to-day in gambling cases on
evidence of thÂ« Society for the Enforce
ment of the Criminal Law.
Whitney Is Closely Confined.
David A. Carvalho. the handwriting ex
pert, was one of the persons who entered
the room. He remained for about an hour.
It is stated that he went over the frag
ments of the papers which Whitney tore
up when arrested Friday and threw from
a window and which were recovered and
were pasted together. It was also said
that Carvalho examined some checks and
other papers in the case.
Asked as to what had taken place Jus
tice Jerome refused to go into details. He
said, however, that he had received a let
tor from Governor Odell regarding the
alleged acceptance of money by the po
lice and that he had answered It. He
would not give out the letter or answer.
An impres&ion seems to prevail that as a
result of the inquiry warrants -will be
issued to-morrow.
Immediately after the proceedings be
fore Justice Jerome, in which the cases
against Whitney and Burgdorf were put
dver until Wednesday, a conference was
held between the Justice, Frank Mops of
â¢xhe Society for the Prevention of Crime,
and Assistant District Attorney Schru
'man, with "others from his office. Tiie
conference was in the nature of a judicial
inquiry to go over the evidence now* in
the hands of the authorities as to alleged
police corruption and to decide on further
steps in the prosecution of offenders yet
to be named. The conference lasted from
2 to 7 p. m. and Whitney and Burgdor*
were submitted to a further secret ex
amination.
Deputy Superintendent Hammond and
Agent Dillon of the Society tor the Pre
vention of Crime brought a mysterious
witness into the room and it is said the
man gave evidence corroborative of that
given by the two prisoners as to the ac
ceptance of money believed to have
reached the police from illegal resorts.
"My relations with Chief Devery at po
lice headquarters were merely those of a
business man. " I went to' see him several
times In connection with my legitimate
business as a private detective of the firm
of Burgdorf & Whitney. I will not say
whether I saw Chief Devery outside police
'headquarters. While I deny that I ar
ranged with Chief Devery at police head
quarters connections through the police
telephone operators with the precincts, I
do not say that Chief Devery did not
make arrangements."
Police Commissioner Murphy said to
day that he did not feel called upon to
take the initiative in any investigation of
Deputy Commissioner Devery or Ward
man Glennon In connection with the al
leged tipping off of poolrooms. He said
he had asked District Attorney Philbin to
make prompt and forcible prosecution of
both men in case the evidence in the Dis
trict Attorney's possession should indicate
them to be guilty.
Deputy Police Commissioner Devery,
who is at Saratoga, declined to be inter
viewed to-day concerning the statement
made by Whitney.
Governor Odell's . private secretary,
James G. Graham, called on District At
torney Philbin to-day. He delivered a
letter from the Governor requesting* the
District Attorney to inform him as soon
as possible of all the facts in the recent
accusations against the Police Depart
ment.
PhiJbln said he was not in a position to
give the facts at once, but would commu
nicate with the Governor in a few days.
Public Prosecutors Hold Conference.
ICEW YORK. Aug. 12.â Edward A.

also suffered from rheumatism of both legs.
After the first application of your wonderful
belt I began to Improve. It completely removed
the convulsions to which I had been subjected,

REDDING, Aug. 12.-JIatt Toung, a
miner, wa3 killed on Friday evening at
Cinnabar, a mining camp eighty miles
northwest of Redding, by R. W. Wallace,
a laborer. Owing to the remoteness of
the locality tho particulars of the homi
cide did not reach Redding until this aft
ernoon.
The. tragedy was the sequel to a game
of cards. Young and another miner went
into a saloon to play poker. They agreed
on R. W. Wallace as overseer of the
game, or to "keep cases" on.it, as it is
termed in gamblers' parlance.
All went well for several deals, until
Wallace accused Young of misplacing the
cut. This was virtually equal to a charge
of cheating, and the game broke up In a
ro/\\ Young became enraged and ran to
his home near by, declaring he would re
turn with a revolver and kill Wallace.
His squaw wife would not let him have
the weapon. He returned and, unarmed,
clinched with .Wallace. They were sepa
rated and some quiet talk ensued, when
all took a drink and" the. affair seemed to
have been settled. However, Young again
went .to his house and managed to carry
away an ordinary butcher knife. With
this weapon he rushed into the saloon and
declared he would kill Wallace. Â¦â¢ ;
Wallace, evidently .- expecting such a
move on his opponent's part,- had- backed
his chair into a corner of the building,
where he could be approached only from
the. front. ,' He showed no weapons, and
-Young, as he advanced on -him .with the
big knife, said tauntingly:. â¢ . Â¦ ..-.--Â¦â¢-.
"Now I've got you where I want you.'"
Wallace coolly warned Young to come
no nearer. 3 Young 'â¢ tried to < close in,\ and
three pistol, shots rang out in quick suc
cession. ;'. Young fell dead. One bullet;had
entered his lungs, another his throat and
a 'third,; possibly the first one discharged,
shattered the hand that had held the
knife. . .
Wallace is -under, arrest; and is being
taken to the jail In Weaveryille.
The missing woman is 25 years of age;
weighs 140 pounds and is of dark com
plexion, with dark hair and brown eyes.
She was dressed in a blue skirt, white
shirt waist and white golf hat. She had
with her a baby girl 12 months of age,
dressed in white. Mr. Hughes fears that
she has committed suicide. He is making
a thorough search of the towns in this
vicinity. -..-.â'
RIVERSIDE, Aug. 12.-C. S. Hughes of
Indio was here to-day looking for his
wife, who wandered away from the Ar
cade; depot in Los Angeles on Friday,
August 2. and uf whom no trace has been
found as yet. Mrs. Hughes was affected
by the heat during the hot spell recently,
and her husband was taking her to Los
Angeles for treatment- when she escaped
from him.
The defeat of Sherk's scheme is said to
have weighed heavily on his mind and
Saturday evening he waylaid McGraw, the
first man to oppose his plans, and beat
him about the head with a stick of stove
wood. McGraw lives In a semi-conscious
condition, with almost a certainty of los
ing the sight of one eye. Sherk was
caught in the act of beating his victim
upon the head after he had fallen stunned
to the ground.
Xews of the brutal attack flew rapidly
around town. The populace became
crazed and word was passed to attend
Sherk's lynching. Constable Lowell Snive
ley swore In three deputies to help him
guard the prisoner and announced that
he would kill the first person who at
tempted to take away his man. His de
cided stand carried the day. Although
angry mutterlngs were heard throughout
the night, no attempt was made to carry
out the projected lynching and Sherk was
landed in the County Jail here last night.
While Sherk is alleged to have made a
vicious attack upon Charles McGraw, a
saloon man at Harrison Gulch, fifty-six
miles southwest of Redding, on Saturday
evening, it is probable that the feeling
scainst him is accentuated by his claims
to land on which the Harrison camp of
pcfEibly 1000 Inhabitants is located. The
business portion of the town was recently
burned. Sberk then eet up his claim to
the land on which the town rests. His
alleged rights had never before been sus
pected.
Thurman & McGraw. saloon men. were
the first to start to rebuild. Sherk for
bade them to unload their lumber. A com
mittee of fifty citizens promptly helped
the saloon men erect their structure and
prevented Sherk Interfering. Squatters'
rights prevailed in the burned district
without any resort to law. Residents and
occupants of land retained Attorney C. H.
Braynard of this city, who is establishing
a townsite for them.
REDDING. Aug. 12.-E. P. Sherk was
landed in the County Jail here last even-
Ing after having been guarded the pre
vious nlgrht from the 2ngry residents of
a mining camp, who expressed a prefer
ence for a lynching rather than allow the
law to take its course. A charge of as
sault to murder rests asainst Sherk.

HEALDSBURG, Aug. 11.â R. A. Castle,
brother of ex-Congressman Castle of Mer
ced, was found dead last evening Jn a
peach orchard a quarter of a mile from
his home. A common pocket handker
chief was knotted about his neck and sus
pended from a twig no larger than a
man's thumb, while the knees and left
hand of the unfortunate man rested firm
ly on . the pround. Charles Williams, a
half-breed Indian, had gone to the river
for a swim and was attracted to the place
where the body hung by the barking of
his dogs. He reported the facts to Mar
shal Ingalls. who brought the body to an
undertaker's office in Healdsburg.
Coroner Pierce of Santa Rosa held an
Inquest this morning- and the Jury re
turned a verdict of death with suicidal
intent. The family, however, denies that
there has been anything in the recent life
of Mr. Castle to prompt the deed, Hts
relatives hold to the theory that his death
was the result of an experiment. Only, a
week ago the suicide of young Poulson
was reported, and Mr. Castle discussed
the circumstances with his family, ex
pressing the opinion that suicide by'hanp
ing was at best a bungling way of quit
ting life. On Sunday morning he planned
his work for the week. He was emploved
by a neighbor at budding trees.. Last
evening -at sundown his body was found
in the orchard," where he was to have
gone to work to-day. There was a pnun
ing knife in his pocket. Castle was al
ways investigating, experimenting and
trying to solve. problems outside the com
mon reach of men. Those who knew him
best, including Coroner Pierce, incline to
the theory that his mind was on the
death of Poulson as he wandered through
the orchard; that he experimented with
his handkerchief to learn its effect. The
end In which the knot was tied was pass
ed over the twig and the pressure upon
the . carotid artery produced insensibility
and finally death. ." . â¢ Â¦ Â¦ -.

cannery workers are flocking to the-

double pay. They are encountering no
great trouble In entering the United
States. Labor has become so scarce
among the Puget Sound canneries that the
latter are glad to employ Chinese. There
Is still a tremendous run of salmon all over
the coast, and, according to actual-com
putation, there are a smaller number of
Chinese cannery employes in Puget Sound
establishments than for three years.
There are many more fish caught In tb.9
traps than can be handled, so the demand
for expert cannery labor has increased
threefold in twice as many days. The
Chinese do all the fish cutting, cleaning
and cooking in the canneries along the
coast and there is a tremendous demand,
with a limited supply, for the work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Who is to determine this matter? Is it 'not
left . to the board at its option to decide this
question? It may divide one or more species of
property into classes of property and be of the
opinion that the other property will not admit
of a uniform value if divided into classes. J Its
power in this respect is unlimited; The act
contemplates that the board may do this, and
in section 5 provides this: "The Assessors of
the several counties of this State shall fix tin
value on all property not so designated at said
meeting in the manner now provided by law."
It will thus be seen that the present act, in
stead of closing the gates against 1 injustice,
leaves the door wide open for all . sorts of dis
crimination. Railroads are of a more complex
character than the other species of property
above named, and it Â¦ is argued by complainant
that they cannot be divided into "classes of
property" under the present act. But be that
as it may, It is apparent that the attempted
valuation in this case cannot; either upon
reason or euthority,- be sustained, because tht
action taken by the State Board of Assessors
in valuing the Central Pacific Railroad by
name without making any class of property
of railroads was not within the power granted
by the act under consideration, and upon that
ground alone, without passing upon the other
points ray conclusion is that complaint is en
titled to the injunction prayed. for. . '
Formerly the railroads in the State of
Nevada were assessed" by the officer of
each county in which they owned prop
erty, and each one of these assessments
was a county affair and independent of
each other. Some time ago the Legisla
ture appointed a board of assessors, com
posed of the Assessors of the different
counties acting together, and this board
proceeded to tax the different roads op
erating in the State, basing their assess
ment on a valuation of all the property
ow,ned in the State computed in one lot
as distinct from county lots.' ... c
As this resulted in an increased assess
ment in the case of all but one of Che
roads doing business in Nevada, the mat
ter was at once taken into court/with the
above mentioned - result.; As' the â¢ United
States Circuit Court never passes on the
constitutionality of State laws, Judge
Hawley has confined himself in his de
cision "to passing on the legality of the
action of the board and not on the consti
tutionality cf the Legislature in creat
ing it.
This decision will, mean much to the
railroads affected by it. as will be seen
from the following: schedule of raised as
sessments which they would "have been i
compelled to pay had the victory gone to
the other side: . The; assessment of the
Central Pacific w&s' raised from $11,442 t3
$20,000 and from $5000 to $7000 on its sid- s
ings. The "Virginia and Truckee rnad was
shoved -up from $1000 to $10,000. The Cary
pon and Colorado was given a boost from
$1700 to $2500, and the Nevada-California-
Oregon's .tax was increased from $2000 to
S30fi0. The only road whose assessment
was allowed to stand at the. ol<l figures
was the Eureka. Palisades and New Cen
tral, which is assessed at, $1960. . .
It is a mooted question upon which there is
ample room for a wide difference of opinion as
to whether or nbr it will accomplish the ben
eficial purposes expressed In the title for a
more uniform valuation and assessment of
property in this fcitate. .It does , not re
quire the valuation, of all property un
der its provision, or of any particular
species of v property) but leaves these
matters to the discretion of the State Board
of Assessors. The provisions of section 1 re
cognize the fact that there is property within
this- State which cannot- be designated Into
classes of property, and hence cannot be
valued by the State board.
CARSON, New, Aug. 12.â Judge Hawley
this morning rendered a decision in favor
of the Southern Pacific Company,
granting an injunction against- the
Assessors of the State of Nevada to pre
vent their taxing the company on a valu
ation of $20,000 per mile, an increase of
$8000 per mile. The opinion states that the
injunction is granted because the Assess
ors failed to properly * classify railroad
property. Regarding the State law it

The present labor controversy in San Francisco .has seriously interfered
wi h business all over the city. Many wage earners, being deprived of their
wage?, are now making every dollar count â thev buy only the necessities of life
and spend as little as possible for clothing. ThereMs no use mincing matters â
this is the situation- â '.t must be met.
We anticipated more than. our usual big tradeâ ordered our workshops to
increase their output, in order to supply our growing trade. These fall and
winter goods have been arriving day after day. and are piled high on our counters
awaiting purchasers. We must dispose of these goods, for other shipments are
coming. We must sell regardless of usual profits. The aggregate of saies must
be kept up â^tore must be kept busy. There is only one way to do this â reduce
the prices/ We have done 50. |fj8*
which have been recen'lv made up in our own workshops to sell for
$12 50 and $\$'Oo are going at $7.85. Box overcoats,, made .up to sell at $10.00,

chance to'buy goo<3, up-to-date cothing and make the dollars count.
The reductions are as we claim. Any customer who is not satisfied thar
the clothes are worth their former prices (regardless of the present selling prices)-,
'can have his money tuck. If he is pleased with his purchase we will keep the
-garments in first-ciass repair free for a year. We offer these liberal privileges to
prove what we have said and d~ne. The reductions are unusual, but "money

Thomas Spencer Brown, who was ar
rested some time ago in San Bernardino
by Sheriff Rouse on suspicion of being the
man who robbed a dental office in Po

any connection with the crime. Brown is
a machinist, who follows the business of
sharpening dental instruments. His uncle
was Minister of the Interior under the
late King Kalakaua of the Sandwich Isl
ands. He is well known in San Francisco
among the dental profession and his ar
rest more than astonished his acquaint
ances. His release on the ground of mis
taken identity somewhat atoned for the
blunder made by the officer who arrested

W. J. Kenney. the chairman, will ap
point the committee to-day, and it is ex
pected that prompt action will be taken
by the combined Interests to bring peace
out of the present turmoil. Kenney de
clared that the retail merchants of San
Francisco, if thay stood together and.
worked for peace, had it In their power
to bring the strike to a speedy close. The
employers were suffering, he said, and the
employes were in even harder straits, but
the real victim of the present struggle
was the general community.
The labor element was largely repre
sented and many of the speeches were)
hardly in keeping. with the peaceful ob
ject of the meeting. Attorney Joseph-
Rothschild, who was present as chair
man of the federated conciliatory com
mittee, called a halt when the oratory
bid fair to grow Into a debate on the rel
ative rights of labor and capital. ;
"I am here to-night," he said, "as a
peacemaker. I am here with some of my
confreres on the conciliatory committee
to extend to you our support in bringing
about an amicable settlement of the pres
ent condition of affairs. We represent
the property owners of the city, we rep
resent merchants, bankers and many oth
ers who are affected just as much as you
are by this unfortunate strike.- The time
has now come for somebody to yield. - If
we find that neither side is willing to re
cede from the present deadlock, then the
Federated Improvement Clubs will do its
best to make both sides yield enough to"
effect a settlement. We propose to go*
about our task in a dignified and peace
ful manner, however, and if you gentle
men wish to join with us on this basis"
we most gladly extend the. hand of fel
lowship and promise to give you all the
support at our command." -
Thomas McKeon thought that If the'
strike continued thirty days longer over
two-thirds of the retail t dealers in the
city would , have to go out of business.
C. L- Barrington echoed Rothschild's
sentiments, as to the method of bringing
about peace. A. Greensf elder, president
of the Municipal League, told of the ef
forts that body had been making " and
pointed out 'some of the rocks on which
their efforts had split. W. A. Cole of the
Building Trades Council made a plea for
unionism and L. H. Cohn spoke for peace.
The committee representing Â¦. the retail
merchants to be appointed to-day will be
instructed to co-operate with the con
ciliatory committee and report' the result
of its efforts at the next regular meeting
of the retailers. . . . ...
The retail merchants of the city held
a meeting last night in Native Sons' Hall
for the purpose of arranging, in concert
with the Federated Improvement Clubs,
some plan of action whereby the parties
to the present labor difficulty may be
brought together with the object of set
tling the strike. There was an attendance
of about 300, but of this number only
about twenty-five were retail merchants.
It was decided to appoint a committee of
five to co-operate with the conciliatory
committee of the Federated Improvement

Alameda County Federated Trades with
Joseph B. Reboli of the Retail Clerks'
Union as chairman and C. A. Sinclair as
secretary to handle the arrangements for
the celebration of Labor day, September

the form of a great parade in which all
of the affiliated unions will take part. The
Building Trades Council will hold a picnic
at Shell Mound Park on Labor day, with
special exercises in the afternoon. The
two celebrations will be arranged in order
that all of the .organizations of labor

in each one.
A conference of labor leaders has been
held here to discuss the question of an
independent labor ticket movement at the

embryotic, although the sentiment was in
favor of such a course. Among those who
took part in the meeting at labor head
quarters were Charles D. Rogers, .State

TiTAKTNE PAINTERS ARE READY
Join City Front Federation and Will
More than 259 marine painters will prob
ably join the â¢water front unions now on
strike some time during the day. This
union, known as Marine Painters' Union
No. 1, was organized some time ago and
recently applied for membership in the
City Front Federation. This application,
was acted upon favorably, and as soon as
some formalities are concluded will be
fully admitted.
"We are now awaiting a delegation from
the City Front Federation," said the
ppokesman last night, "to initiate us into
that body. We expect to get orders to
walk out in the morning and every one of
our 254 members will at once obey.' "-We
embrace all the marine painters in the.,
city, except the men working on the
transports. They deserted us when "we
secured for them an eight-hour work day
and $3 a day, and none of our members
will Â¦work on a ship Â¦with them."
The men who work on the transports
have a union composed exclusively of
those engaged in that class of labor. It
Is not affiliated with the City Front Fed- :
eration. The Marine Painters is probably
the last of the unions employed along the
water front" that can now be called upon
to strike.

Kast, who accepted work as a teamster
with Cutter & Co.. was treated for several
bad lacerations of the head and scalp by
Dr. McElroy at the General Emergency
Hospital at 3 o'clock yesterday morning.
Wood claimed that while sleeping at the
company's stables. 421 Brannan street, a
Rang of union teamsters dragged him
from his bunk and beat him. So deter
mined were his assailants to do a good job
that they tried to take him out of the am
bulance while it was on its way to i the
hospital. Driver Martin Walsh and Stew
ard Bert Davis were requested to stop the
ambulance by a gang of men until they
could see who was inside. . Â¦
The driver whipped up his horses and
brought Wood to the hospital.
He had received a dreadful beating
about the head and face. ' Several scalp
wounds required the surgeon's needle be
fore they were closed. In addition to these
there were several contused wounds and
possibly some fractured ribs to be nursed
before Wood will again drive a team.

Anti-Chinese Petition Heady.
At the last quarterly meeting of the
State Federation of Labor it was decided
to make an effort to secure a re-enact
ment of the Scott exclusion act. which
expires in May, 1902. The assistance of all
laboring bodies it was decided to ask, and
the San Francisco Labor Council also took
up the matter. As a result the following
petition Is beine circulated:
We, the undersigned citizens of the State of
California, respectfully urge upon the Congress
of the United States that It re-enact at tht
earliest possible moment the Chinese Exclu
sion Act, which expires on Slay 6, 1902, with
amendments to embrace all classes of Asiatics
Including Japanese, extending its provisions to
ell territory under the Jurisdiction of the Unit
ed States and making it perpetual in operation.
Leave the Harbor.
Steamer Eureka the Only Vessel to
But two vessels arrived in the harbor
yesterday and two departed. The barken
tlne Planter, from Honolulu, loaded with
sugar, arrived yesterday morning, and
the British bark Foyldale, in ballast from
Peru, arrived about noon. The Planter
was anchored off the Refinery wharf
and the Foyldale made preparations to
go to Port Costa.
The steamer Eureka, bound for the port
of that name, got away partly loaded
with a cargo of general merchandise. She
also carried quite a few passengers. The
Point Arena cleared last last night.
Gangs of men were at work on the
Olympia and the Oregonian at the
Steuart-street dock, but little was accom
plished In unloading .them.
The Achnashie and the Cymbaline,
which arrived here a few days ago in
ballast, were towed to Port Costa, where
they will be loaded with wheat.
The unloading of the colliers Is still go
ing on, but all the vessels still have a
number of tons of coal in their bunkers.
The collier .Wellington is anchored in the
stream, and the Asuncion is at Mission
flats. The cargo of the last named ves
sel is being transferred to the barge
Comanche. .
At the Mail dock there was little evi
dence that a strike was on. A large num
ber of men are at work there unloading
the Acapulco. The great quantity of
freight which during the first few days
of the strike accumulated on the wharf
has all been removed and the Pacific Mall
officials claim that in the future they will
have no difficulty in handling their car
goes.
The Argyle is at Fremont-street dock
unloading. As soon as her freight is re
moved she will be brought around to
Howard-street wharf, where she Â¦will be
loaded for a return voyage.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company will tie up the steamers Colum
bie and Geo. W. Elder upon their arrival
at Portland. So much difficulty was en
countered in getting them ready to sail
from here that the company will not try
to send them out again until the strike
is over. iÂ»^ ,'.%â¢". j
GROCERS ASK FOR PEACE.
Pass Resolutions Demanding Whole-
salers Confer "With Strikers.
At a meeting of the Retail Grocers' As
sociation held last night at B'nai B'rith
Hall a resolution was adopted* demanding
that the wholesale dealers hold a confer
ence with the strikers and with the men
who are locked out, the conference to be
for the purpose of adjusting the existing
trouble, which the retailers claim, is ab
solutely ruining business.
The Retail Grocers' Association has a
membership of about 400,. which includes
the most prominent merchants engaged
In the grocery business... It la-, believed
that their efforts will have considerable
weight in influencing the Employers' As
sociation to accept terms. t
The retail grocers do not intend to be
alone In their appeal to the Employers'
Association, but will, endeavor to have
their demand backed up by other associa
tions engaged in both . wholesale and re
tail business. The Wholesale Grocers' As
sociation, the commission men and the
Wholesale Liquor Dealers' Association
will be asked to join in the move for
peace". For the purpose of soliciting the
aid of these associations the following
committee was appointed: George Alpers,
J. M. Sullivan, I. Solomon, E. McCoy and
P. A. Buckley. .
The resolution Is as follows:
Whereas, The present strike and lockout
is decreasing the nurchasintr power of the
working people of San Francisco: and whereas,
the diminution of trade consequent thereon is
threatening the welfare of every retail mer
chant in this city, be it
Resolved, That the retail grocers of San
Francisco, for the sake of the preservation of
their business and to prevent 'â¢ the commercial
disaster that muBt surely follow a continuation
of the present -disturbance., hereby demand
that the wholesalers of San Francisco arranne
a conference with their striking and locked out
employes, to the end that an immediate set
tlsment of their difficulties shall be brought
about. Signed by the committee: '

The executive committee of the Labor
Council met last' night to consider the sit
uation, but as no reply Â»had been received
from Mayor Phelan it adjourned without
taking definite action.
"We look upon them as Pinkertons and
can see no need for their employment..
Labor- has stood a great deal from, the
regular police force, but perhaps labor
will not be so patient with these men,"
was Rosenberg's concluding remarks.
A question that was vehemently argued
was the proposed appointment by the
Board of Police Commissioners to-night
of 200, special police officers at the request
of the Employers' Association.
'?These men," said Secretary Rosenberg,
"are v nothing more nor less than men
clothed with the authority of the city as
police offlcers, : provided with pistols and
clubs .and licensed to go out and kill 1 in
the <JIscharge'of their duty. They are paid
by their, employers, will obey their orders
and can shoot and kill under the full
sanction of the authority conferred upon
them by the* municipality of San Fran
cisco.
Â¦j-jâ =fa FFORTS of organized labor are
? to be put forth to secure the re
==^ moval of George A. Newhall, the
]l | ,^ president of the Board of Police
Commissioners, who as president
of the Chamber of Commerce signed the
letter addressed by that body to the
Mayor asking him to issue a proclama
tion that violence would not be permitted
and to call upon the State officials for aid
If that had no effect.
A committee from the executive council
of the San Francisco Labor Council called
upon Mayor Phelan at his office in the
City Hall yesterday and had a long con
ference with him.
W. H. Goff. president, and Ed Rosen
berg, secretary of the San Francisco La
bor Council; Michael Casey, president,
and A. Furuseth, strike manager of the
City Front Federation, and John F. Har
per, president of the Sand Teamsters' Un
ion, formed the committee. The spokes
man was A. Furuseth, who laid down in
a forcible manner the reasons why or
ganized labor demanded of Mayor Phelan
the removal of Commissioner Newhall.
All the other, members of the committee
participated in the debate that followed.
Mayor Phelan was a patient listener for
nearly two hours, frequently asking ques
tions regarding the reasons; which
prompted the request. There was no lack
of ready answers. No result was reached,
but at the conclusion Mayor Phelan inr
formed the members of the committee
that he would probably write a letter giv
ing his views upon the matter. He de
clined, however, to : outline what his views
â¢were or what his answer to the commit
tee would be.
While the situation regarding the iron
workers strike in this city remains to all
outward appearances unchanged, both
President McCabe of the Iron Trades
Council and Secretary Wisler said the out
look was. most encouraging, as all the
"i e ?v. were standing firm. ; Yesterday mark
ed the commencement of the twelfth week
of the strike, with no evidence of yielding
Â°1 th ,? part of tne leading iron working
establishments in this city. It is claimed
by the latter that they are gradually fill
ing up their ranks with non-union men.
flfty-seven-hour week, fired all the "scabs'*
and reinstated all the strikers. This is a very
big- gain for Sharon,' for, as you are well
aware, there are thousands of other employes
employed in the mill besides the machinists. -
The statement made in circular No. 7, giving
the number of firms, ; is a. very fair barometer
of the true situation, and I am safe in saying
that at the present time we have secured the
shorter work day. for over 60,000 machinists
and at least as many other working mechanics.
The West of Castro Street Improvement
Company filed another protest against the
operation of Gray Bros.' rock crusher and
quarry at Twenty-sixth and Douglass
streets. It was referred to the Health
Committee. â¢ .
The resignation of John F. Lenahan as
assistant clerk of the board was accepted
and James Lynch was appointed to suc
ceed him.
The City Attorney wa? directed to in
form the board as to its powers In the
event of proof being made that the char
ter is being violated by Gray Bros. In re
<juirlnj? their street sweepers to work over
eight hours per day.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution directing the City
Attorney to furnish an opinion as to
whether or not the People's Mutual Tele
phone Company has forfeited its fran
chise by reason of non-compliance with
the conditions of the ordinance granting
the franchise and Â¦what steps are neces
sary to insure the collection of the $10,000
forfeited in* the bond given by' the com
pany. The resolution alleges that none of
the requirements imposed upon the com
pany have been complied with.
The ordinance limiting the speed of au
tomobiles to eight mijes an hour and half
that speed at street crossings was passed
to print after an amendment limiting their
speed to twelve miles an hour outside of
the flre limits was adopted. The Judi
ciary Committee was directed to draft an
ordinance regulating the granting of li
censes for automobiles.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
indefinitely postponed a resolution which
would have resulted In the appointment
of outside counsel to help defend the suit
of the Spring Valley Water "Works against
the city to determine the legality of the
new water rates. The resolution was In
troduced by Reed and authorized the "Ju
diciary Committee to confer with the
Mayor and the City Attorney "for the
purpose of making such recommendations
as they saw fit in preparing a defense."
The City Attorney was directed to re
port the status of the litigation involving
"Mission Plaza property."
The ordinance providing for the repav
lnj? of certain streets was amended to
eliminate the proposed .work on Spear
street, between Mission and Market. The
.work of* repaying will be prosecuted on
Spear street from . Howard to Mission;
Stockton street from Union to Pacific, to
cost- $7550; Van Ness avenue from Pine to
Bush streets, 15750; Clay street from/San
some to Davis, $7466; Washington street
from Sansome to Battery, $1907; Valencia
street from Market to Eighteenth, $23,690.
.Braunhart objected, to a reduction of
Jloo on the bill of Gray Bros, for sweep
ing the streets on the ground that the
reduction was not sufficient. Braunhart
alleged that the streets were not properly
swept and that the firm was violating the
eight-hour law. The Mayor stated that
he had received the report of the inspec
tor of street sweepings that the sweeping
had been badly done in July because of
the newness of the contract. The bills
were referred to the Street Committee for
further investigation.
The resolution authorizing the Board of
Works to repave Pacific avenue from
Franklin to Fillmore streets was defeated.
Qbjection was made because the proposed
pavement is of inferior character. An
other resolution directing the Board of
Works to repave the blocks with bitumen '
on a concrete foundation and to assess the
cost to property owners was adopted.
The Bay City Athletic Club was granted
permission to hold an amateur boxing ex
hibition on August 22.
But two steamers left the port yesterday, and the announcement was made by the Oregon Bailway
and Navigation Company that it would tie up its vessels at Portland until" such time as the strike was set
tled. The painters claimthat they are making material gains and that fourteen master painters have
signed the new schedule. The day was remarkably free from any serious disturbances. : >
A conference, with Mayor Phelan, in which some of the local labor leaders urged their reasons
for demanding the removal of President Newhall of the Board of Police Commissioners, and made a
protest against the appointment of a large number of special police officers, was ? the most prominent
event of the day in labor circles. Some forty-five tanners walked out, refusing to handle a load of goods
delivered by a non-union teamster. The Marine Painters' Union jwdll join the City Front Federation to
day, and its members .will obey the order to strike. The retail merchants organized, and the Retail Gro
cers' Association adopted resolutions demanding that the Employers' Association take steps to end the
controversy.

Dye and Stidger made charges against
Dunn of bias and prejudice against Chi
nese Immigrants and of discourtesy to
ward attorneys practicing in the bureau.
Dunn made 'countercharges of unprofes
sional conduct and asked that they be dis
barred from the bureau. Immigration
Commissioner Powderly sustained Dunn
and recommended to Collector Stratton
that Dye and Stidger be disbarred, in his
discretion. Mr. Stratton inquired into the
matter and declined, to disbar the gentle
men named. In a letter to the Commis
sioner Mr. Stratton says;
"It is sufficient for me to say that in all
that I have seen of these two gentlemen
nothing has occurred which in my opinion
should call for, their disbarment. The
matter of the relations between the in
spector in charge (Mr. Dunn) of the Chi
nese Bureau and the attorneys who prac
tice before him has assumed such a phase
that the inspector in charge has himself
requested that a hearing, be given him. In
regard to the charges of discourteous
treatment. - I do not find myself free to
follow him in his attitude toward all of
the attorneys who practice before me."
United States Immigration Commis
sioner North has set August 27 at 2 p. m.
as the time for beginning the investiga
tion Into the charges preferred against
Clarkson Dye and O. P. Stidger by James
R. Dunn, chief of the Chinese Bureau,
and also Into the complaints of discour
tesy made by them and other attorneys
against Chief Dunn. Mr. North says that
this investigation, like all others pursued
by the Government, will be private so far
as the press and public are concerned.

Veale and Constable Moiles of Crockett,
secured all the incriminating evidence in
Winters' cabin. Morse says he was the
first to tell â¢ President Ralston of Selby's
that Winters was the robber.
"I don't want any of this reward for
myself," said Morse yesterdav, Â¦ "but I
want to see that Donaldson, Sheriff Veale
and Constable Moiles get what is due
them. Detective Gibson did good work
and should share in the reward, and so
should the Pinkertons. Lees had nothing
to do with securing evidence. After Win
ters was brought to this city Lees was
given the privilege of questioning him. If
Lees thinks he is going to get all the re
ward we will give him a good fight."
Captain Seymour, Chief of Detectives,
says that he will not mix up In any fight
over the reward, and will not allow his
men to do so.
"My reputation," said Seymour, â¢ "Is
worth twice $25,000 to me. . I do not intend
to get mixed up in any quarrel over the
reward. Good work was done by some
men on the case, while others who are
claiming glory and reward did nothing."

Better Financial Showing.
During the fiscal year of the order there
were Instituted two councils, Madrona at
Crescent City and Salesian in this city.
In that time there was a fair Increase in
membership, but the gain was offset by
the dissolution of some councils. The
membership at this time Is about 4500 in
the jurisdiction, which includes California
and Nevada. In the year about $13,000
was expended for sick and funeral bene
fits, and' while there has not been any net
gain in members there is a better show
ing In finance than there was at the close
of the previous year. The experiment of
having a junior branch of the order,
which was brought about through the ef
forts of the Rev. Father T. J. O'Connell
in Alameda, has proved very satisfactory.
During the session the officers of the ju
nior branch of Alameda will exemplify the
Â¦work of initiation.
Grand President L. E. Mahan. by virtue
of his office, will become the junior past
grand president, and it is probable that
D. J. O'Leary, at present first vice presi
dent, will become the grand president,
although there may be some opposition.
T. W. Kelly of Santa Cruz aspires to the
office of first grand vice, and J. D. Wha
len would like to rank as second grand
vice. William T. Aggeler would willingly
serve another term as grand treasurer,
while George A. Stanley, who during the
time that he has been secretary has by
courtesy and close attention to the duties
devolving upon him won many warm
friends, will be retained for another term.
Two Important matters will be brought
up for discussion during the session. One
will be a proposition to change the name
of the organization to the Catholic In
stitute of America. Thoso who favor the
change declare that as the objects of the
society are "mutual aid and benevolence,
the moral, social and intellectual im
provements of its members and the proper
development of sentiments of devotion to
the Catholic church and loyalty to coun-
Although ex-Chief of Police Lees has
practically admitted that John Winters,
who stole a quarter of a million dollars'
worth of gold bullion, was promised im
munity from arrest and a monetary re
ward for divulging the hiding place of the
booty, statements were made yesterday
that Winters is to be prosecuted and pun
ished for his crime.
The general impression that Lees in a
number of "heart to heart talks" " with
Winters promised the robber leniency and
money was confirmed not only by Lees'
statements, but also by the bold and de
fiant attitude of the man held at the City
Prison.
Winters will not admit that he has bean
promised his freedom or that he is to re
ceive any money for having stolen a huge
fortune and then divulging its hiding
place.
The prisoner maintains a defiant atti
tude and seems confident that he will
soon be at liberty and have "money to
turn." On the other hand, the president
cf the Selby Company says that Winters
is to be prosecuted and that no reward
will be paid until he is landed in the State
prison.
Yesterday three heavy bars of gold
were recovered from beneath the waters
of Carqulnez Straits, where Winters
dumped his booty, the value of the bars
being $C5,5S3 13. This gold, with that fished
up last Saturday morning, aggregates a
little more than $206,000, leaving nearly
577.000 in gold bars still to be sought for in
the muddy waters.
Denies Deal With Winters.
President Ralston of the Selby Company
was emphatic in stating that Winters
Â¦would be prosecuted and punished for his
crime.
"The story published in an evening. pa
per on Saturday," said President Ral
ston, "is a gross fabrication and is an out
rage. Our company never authorized any
one to offer immunity to Winters or prom
ise him a single cent as a reward if he
would divulge where he had hidden the
bullion.
"On Wednesday last we offered a re
ward of J25.CW for information which
would lead to the recovery of the bullion
and arrest and conviction of the thieves.
AVe took every step to close any avenue
of escape and secured the services of the
ablest detectives in the State. We have
not and will not change our policy in this
matter. Xo ieward will be paid by us to
anv one until the terms under which we
offered it are fully carried out. We are
not concerned in any dispute among the
detectives and officials as to the rignt to
claim the reward.
"If any one induced Winters to confess
by promising him a share of the reward
offered or guaranteed him his freedom
It was done without our authority. We
left the matter of running down the rob
ber and the recovery of the bullion in the
hands of the detectives. The Pinkerton
agency was made the headquarters and
we referred all persons to them. It is npi
just to our. company that an impressior
should gain currency that we would make
terms with a. thief. We- have been in busi
ness for thirty years and our reputatlor
is well known in the community. I car
but repeat emphatically that we stand to
tlay just as we did when we offered th<
reward. The confession of Winters anc
the recovery of the bullion have no1
changed our views. As far as we are con
cerned, the reward of Winters for h:.'
crime will be prosecution and imprison
mpDL"
Wliat tho Pinkertons Sayl
Superintendent McParland of the Pink-
Agency stated yesterday that he
was not concerned in the dispute over the
reward offered by the Selby Company,
and that Winters would be prosecuted.
"It ir an iron-clad rule of our agency,"'
s=a:d McParland. "that none of our men
sha!! receive rewards. All this talk about
Winters being promised -his freedom and
a big bonus for stealing more than a
quarter of a million dollars' worth of gold
i= mere moonshine. You can state that
Â¦\Vinters will be speedily placed on trial
anc given his deserts.
"I was opposed to the offer of a large
regard. I suggested a reward only large
enough to stimulate the efforts of local
officials throughout the State. Winters
understood perfectly from me that we had
all the evidence to convict him and give
him a long term in prison. I warned him
that he would npver have a chance to get
near the bullion he had stolen. I told him
that if he was in prison for thirty years
when he came ov.t we would have a
man with him day and night until he'
died.
Stole to "Win. a Beward.
"I am convinced that "Winters stole the
bullion solely with the idea of securing a
big reward. His work was crude and he
left a clear trail - behind him. His idea
Â¦was to join in the hunt for the gold and
when a large reward was offered to fish
it up in the presence of witnesses and
claim the reward. 1 consider Winters a
far more dangerous criminal under these
circumstances than one Â¦who Intended to
get away with his plunder. He knew
very well that he could not get away with
any of the bullion, and he lies when he
says that was his intention. I am con
vinced that he left two gold bricks on the
rocks in order to create the impression
that the gold had been taken away in a
boat. He will be far safer in. prison than
out of It. Our organization secured the
evidence against him and the prosecution
will not be delayed."
Winters Is still in the prison at the Hall
of Justice. He will be kept there until
Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County
comes over for him and removes him to
the jail at Martinez.
May Play Insanity Dodge.
TVhen WirHers was informed that he
could be sent to prison for a long term
of years he whistled between his teeth
and then laughed. He got up. from the
seat where he had been resting, dug his
hands into his trousers pockets and
jumped around the room and giggled like
a schoolgirl.
If Winters p'ays the insanity dodge
when he Is placed on trial it would not
be surprising. He seems to be perfectly
tangulne that he will be soon at liberty
and that he will have plenty of money to
spend as a result of looting the Selby
safe and then telling where he had hidden
the bullion.
Winters made a long statement yester
day before Captain of Detectives Seymour
in which he explained how kindly he had
been treated while he was under examina
tion in the Hall of Justice. "Winters ex
plained that he was not "tortured" into
answering questions and that no threats
or promises of reward were made by Sey
mour or the men of the office In order to
secure information. Winters says noth
ing, however, as to any "heart to heart
talks" he had with ex-Chief of Police
Lees.
Bitter Fight for Beward.
The right for the $25,000 reward offered
by the Belbys premises to be a lively one.
Detective Harry Morse yesterday filed a
claim with the Selby company on behalf
of Pete Donaldson. Sheriff Veale of
Contra Costa County and himself.
In the communication Morse says that
Donaldson was the first to give Informa
tion connecting Winters with the rob-

hroughout the vast collection of things, merged as

It happened that he got the correct answer. Per
laps to many that very question of fencing is vital
n determining whether they will seek a home in Cali
ornia. All this shows that the value of an exhibit
ies greatly in the exhibitor, who must be able to ex
,-lain it intelligently to the spectators.
We use almonds and walnuts as an illustration of
he method by which the visitors to our exhibit are
nformed in detail upon every subject about which
hey inquire, from mining to fishing. It is this which
jives value to an exhibit. Questions are answered by
jrinted matter and orally. If any one think that he
â¢jsn make a printed description so complete that noth
ng remains unanswered he is greatly mistaken. A
locument giving full information about the making
)f an orchard from the first start to the first harvest
s-as supposed to answer everything. An intelligent
">bserver read it through and asked, "Do you fence
rour orchards?" Being told that we do he asked at
jhee, "Which do you find the cheaper, wire or lum
jcr?"
It is -news to thousands in the East that we pro
luce almonds and English walnuts. When they ask
ibout these they can find out the volume of their pro
luction, the parts of the State where they flourish, the.
ige at which the trees come to bearing, the method
if harvesting and preparing the nuts for market, and
til information that fixes the subject in the mind of
he inquirer, so that hereafter when he cracks an al
nond or a walnut California occurs to him, and the
tweet nut becomes an advertiser of the State.
It is not necessary for Californians to make the
ourney to see it It is intended for the eyes of those
vho ought to be in California, and for those who
tee in our great exhibit an opportunity to do profit

IT is a far cry to Buffalo, and not many Californians

omians who were in Paris last year could not find the
state in the official exhibit As far as the visiting
jeople of the world were concerned California might
:s well have not been there at alL It was merely a
>art of the general tone and Color of the exposition,
vithout individuality and impossible to separate from
he mass in which it was merged. This is not the
:ase at Buffalo. There the State is a unit, an indi

f ast and varied resources.

Did I insist in my letter that the strikers
should interfere with their business or

The employer has all the force on Ms side
in the shape of mounted police and scab
cops, all armed to the teethâ the majesty
of the law to back them up. The employer
says he recognizes the right of laboring
men to organize. Bosh! The poor man
has no rights which the rich man thinks
he ought to respect, except the right to
work at his dictation. Interfering with
and trying to run their business. More
bosh! I cannot help but laugh when I see
some of these white-handed dudes trying
to handle the heavy end of their business.
They are like a cow handling a gun. Talk
about the responsibility of the rich and
the irresponsibility, legality and all that
not comprehend, perhaps not to
suit him. Workmen are not allowed to
understand anything but work and not
work, just as it suits the employers. Talk
about contracts! The so-called contracts
that the teamsters had to sign in order to
get a job are a disgrace to civilization.
They are all' one-sided. The employer
could lay off any man at a minute's no
tice, while the worker was bound down
like a chattel slave. I did not say' in my
letter that unions never broke their con
tracts. I said as a rule unions keep their
contracts, and as a rule it is the employ

THE STATE AT BUFFALO.
Dispatches from Washington say: "It is the under
standing at the Navy Department that the action taken
closes the incident." So there is to be no examination
into the facts. We are never to know which side has
told the truth, or whether Chandler is an insect or not.
Having read the story as told by Evans^ Chandler
complained to the Navy Department that such lan
guage from an officer of the navy concerning a former
Secretary of the Navy was derogatory to the service.
His complaint has been acted upon and the "rear ad
miral has been censured. The letter of censure says:
"The text of your book it not necessary here to
recite. Nor is it needful to ask of you an explanation
why you felt yourself justified in publishing what you
have. * * * You are infor/ned'that this deliberate
publication of yours has justly incurred the displeasure
of the department. For an officer thus to attack the
former head of the Navy Department because of
orders given to him by that official is to abandon the
courtesy that should always characterize an officer of
the navy."
Report was made to the Secretary of -the Navy that
I was interfering with the political conditions in the
Fifth District, and, without asking a word of explana
tion from me, I was punished by being relieved and
placed on half Â«pay. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Finding myself on the
beach, as it were, because I would not take a hand in
politics, rather than because I had done so, and know
ing that I would not have employment again during the
time of the administration then in power, I, asked for
leave for a year, with permission to leave the United
States. In tho absence of the Secretary of the Navy the
request was granted, and I was busy making my prep
arations to enjoy it when a telegram came from the
Secretary revoking my leave and again placing me on
waiting orders. I was really of much more importance
than I had considered myself, and I must be made to
feel my punishment. However, I had felt the sting of
insects before in my life and did not consider them of
much importance. "Â¦Â»
The public, it seems, is to be left in something of
the same ignorance concerning the essential point in
the controversy between Rear Admiral Robley D.
Evans and ex-Secretary Chandler. In his recently
published book, "A Sailor's Log," Evans charged that
he had been mistreated by Chandler when that retired
statesman was Secretary of the Navy. He says he was
transferred from his position on the Advisory Board
to be Lighthouse Inspector in the Fifth District; that
while there he was asked to appoint as lightkeeper a
man who had been a delegate to a political convention
and had performed services which he and his bosses
thought should be rewarded. Evans deemed him in
competent and would not pass him.
In his book the rear admiral, after telling the
story, goes on to say:
SOME years ago there was a very popular humor
ous poem going the rounds of the press which
described in vivid language a row that took place
in a barroom because one gentleman claimed a
"whiskyskin" that had been concocted for another.
In the course of the row several men were killed and
the barroom wrecked. At the Coroner's inquest all
the facts were brought out except one â not a single
witness could remember who got the "whiskyskin." .
When once the races begin, however, we are not
likely to hear much of these doubts. The public mind
will take note of nothing but the fact that rihee more
the yachtsmen of Great Britain are trying to carry off
from this country the greatest sporting trophy of the
world, and have brought over what in their judgment
is the best boat they have, while our yachtsmen have
done their best to build a boat that will beat her. The
trial races, with all their disappointments on both
sides, are over. Now comes the contest of the cham
pions. Sometimes of course-the unexpected happens,
but this time it looks as if the' usual thing would be
repeated and another triumph scored by American
yacht-builders and sailors.
These doubts raised by the comparatively bad show
ing made by the rivals in their respective trials with
the contestants in the former race naturally put some
thing of a, damper on popular enthusiasm. The pub
lic cannot be surethat either country has put its best
boat in the race.
In one' respect the coming race, will be disappoint
ing. The trial races have by no means proven that
Shamrock II is a better boat than Shamrock I, or
that the new defender, the Constitutionals any better
than the Columbia. In fact, it has been repeatedly
said that the Constitution has disappointed her man
agers. After the trial races between the two some
yachting experts said that if it were necessary to
choose a boat to meet the new challenger on the
record made in the trials the Columbia would have
to be chosen.
The new challenger has impressed the New York
ers favorably. The dispatcher say: "One glance was
sufficient to convince the experts that Watson. has
built a much handsomer boat that the old Shamrock.
SHe looks the fastest boat ever turned out in British
waters." .
SHAMROCK II has reached New York in safety
and has been received with a genuine sportsman
like welcome. Sir Thomas Lipton has lost none
of the popularity he gained in this country when he
made his first effort to lift the "America's cup, and
therefore in the rivalry that will attend the coming
races there will be nothing but good feeling o?i both
sides. â¢ .
"WHO GOT THE WHISKYSKIN?
NOW FOR THE YACHT RACE.
THE ZODIAC-Heavenly Bound, City.
The twelve signs of .the zodiac are in tho
following order: Aries (ram), Tarua
(bull), Gemini (twins). Cancer (crab), Leo
(lion), Virgo (virgin), Libra (balance),
Scorpio (scorpion), Sagittarius (archer),
Capricornus (goat), Aquarius (water bear
er), Pisces (fishes). The signs of the zo
diac embrace the twelve important con
stellations, which, owing to the motions
of the earth, appear to revolve through
the heavens within a belt extending- nine
degrees on each side of the sun's appar
ent annual path- and within and near
which all planets revolve. Since the sun
appears successively in each of. these
twelve constellations during the yeax, the
zodiac was divided into twelve equal
parts corresponding to the months^ These
signs and their subdivisions were used in
measuring time and as the basis of as
tronomical and astrological calculations
and predictions.

Garfield never occupied the cottage, but
all the time Chester Alan Arthur was
President the cottage was again used as
a' summer residence. When McKinley was
first inaugurated there was some talk of
his moving to the Soldiers' Home, partly
because of its beauties and conveniences
and partly because he has a war record
of his own which might make the place
attractive to him for sentimental reasons.
Mrs. McKinley preferred to spend her
summers in Canton, so the President
never occupied Anderson cottage.
When Lincoln was assassinated the cot
tage was held in such reverence that it
remained empty. .When Grant became
President he occupied the cottage at in
tervals of a few days, but never perma
nently. Hayes was the 'first President
after Lincoln to make the place his per
manent summer home.
The Riggs cottage was turned over to
President Lincoln during the summer of
1861. The President was'so charmed with
the spot that he moved his family from
the White House and occupied the cottage
each summer until the end. The cot
tage was christened "The PresIdent's^Cot
tage" at first, but by Lincoln's own di
rection it was then named after General
Anderson of Fort Sumter, and is still of
ficially designated as Anderson's Cottage.

to let General Scott keep the money, but
this the general would not do. Finally
he solved the problem^by personally pur
chasing the Riggs estate and converting
it into a National Soldiers' Home.
DENOUNCES MONEY POWER AND
SAYS UNIONISM MUST REMAIN
FOR half a century the United States
has provided its Presidents with an
imposing official residence in the
shape of the White House, and also
with a more modest official retreat, .
a rambling, antique country cottage., lo
cated in the National Soldiers' Home, two
miles north of Washington.'.
It Is the only, country home officially
provided for our Presidents, and since the
time of Lincoln it has been at the disposal
of each Chief Magistrate. Now it is to
be torn down. It is an obstacle in the
path of the improvements contemplated
at the home. . The plans for the demoli
tion of the cottage and the erection of an,
imposing marble hall upon the site await
the signature of the Secretary of War.
Pressure is being brought to bear upon
him not to sign the paper which will re
tire into oblivion one oiL the most Inter
esting sights around Washington. Before^
finally approving of the plan it is hoped
thÂ»t President McKinley will . Interfere,
and as the home is the official country
residence of the Presidents of the United
Statesâ the only one, tooâ there is a pros
pect that the President will not sanction
the proposed change. '
The cottage was originally erected in
1810 by George Washington Riggs, one of
the first citizens of Washington.
, After the Mexican War General Winfield
Scott returned with his victorious army,
and among the spoils of war brought from
the Mexican capital was the sum of $70,
000 in gold, "exacted by General Scott from
General Santa Anna as indemnity for the
firing on an American flag of truce by the
Mexicans. General Scott offered it to Con-

With "Employer" on the Existing Labor Differences.
A CHANCE TO SMILE
Employer may as well saw -wood and
submit to the inevitable. Unionism has
come to stay. That is the only way that
Master Monopoly and Master Trust can
be attended to. When a rich employer
boasts that he can go to Paris and enjoy
himself until the poor man is starred into
submission it is time for the workman to
say. Let 'him go, and may he break his
neck before he gets there and give a bet
ter man a chance to run his plant. Em

nor hours. No? That's the keystone of
all the trouble, and if my brother workers
will only leave liquor alone and keep a
stiff upper lip they will win out and have
time tp improve their minds and money
to enjoy a little of the pleasures of life.
But what am I talking about? Pleasures
for a workingman? A glass of steam beer
and a 10-cent seat in the Orpheum is good
enough for him. He must not aspire to
keep himself and family in a proper way,
but be like a Japanese or Chinamanâ
simply mind his work and have no fol
lowers. Take what he gets and thank
them first and God afterward for living.
But there is a good time coming:. Only
wait a little longer. Noble manhood and
gentle womanhood, honesty and virtue
are crushed by the money power. The
money power takes good care. of its horses
and dogs. Why? Because they cost
money, while men do not. Respectfully,

We advise against such a disgraceful act. We have not omitted reasons for that
advice. We advise now, on the edge of the hour for action, that the Republicans of this
city go to the primary polls and repudiate the nasty leadership of Martin Kelly.
The Republican papers which oppose him desire to defeat the sale of the party
to an evil combination made up of the railroad and Martin Kelly. Let- Republicans who
are being plied with the argument that the newspapers must be punished reflect that
the method proposed will punish the party and not the papers. The Republican press
can survive and grow stronger while opposing filthy leadership of the party, but the
party cannot long- survive such leadership. The issue is joined. It .is not made by the
newspapers. , The Call* has no more interest in Republican purity and decency and suc
cess than has any single member of the party. What we have said in advocacy of a re
spectable leadership for the party is only what every whole-hearted Republican has said.
The only difference is that : a newspaper commands wider publicity than an individual.
Those who talk about getting even are not able to injure the newspapers. They are only
trying to get even with the element of decency and purity in the Republican party. The
newspapers did not create that element. It is in existence in the nature of things. It is
the Republican boast that the party has in its ranks a full share of the cleanness,
morality and intelligence of the community. What a vainglorious boast that ' will be if
such a party, with its eyes wide open and aware of what it is doing, shall deliber
ately vote its leadership to Martin Kelly.
The boss gang is trying to ma^e capital out of the opposition, to the bos,s.. of the
Republican press of the city. They are around advising men that it is a good time to
get even with the newspapers, and Martin Kelly a good man to use in the process.
We agree that it is a good time to decide, whether the party prefers a self-seeking,
offensive and repulsive boss to newspapers whose single offense is their opposition to
the disgrace of liis domination. _v
Let.it not be forgotten by Republicans who wish to. win the government of this
city in order to administer it in the interest of the people, tha^the last Republican can
didate for Mayor was beaten because he was betrayed into an interview with Martin
Kelly. He was a man of purity and uprightness of character who, would have scorned a
bargain with Kelly or any one else, and if elected he would have given the city a fault
less administration. Yet he was beaten for speaking to Martin Kelly. Remember this,
and then reflect what will be the result if the whole party deliberately- votes itself into
Martin Kelly's arms. Â¦
.The forces opposed to him are not in a corner nor under a mask. They are led
by men who have civic pride and the welfare of the party at heart. They are governed
by principle, and are Republicans because they believe in the party and what it stands
for. Not a Republican in this city believes that' Martin Kelly is such a Republican, or
a Republican at all from any consideration of principle. He is' simply what all men know
him to be â a boss) who deals and dickers in politics^ Masquerading as a Republican, he
controls a small and compact body of mercenaries, and throws their vote to either party
at will, as a consideration paid for by those whom he supports!
AS Republicans go to the polls of the primary to-day let them be impressed'ithat it
is now or never in the great issue of freeing the party and the city from boss
rule. The issue would be less grave if the boss were less fetid and offensive. If
the party can swallow' Martin Kelly now it cannot ; tie expected io strain at any
thing in the future. He represents every possible revolting thing that can be in politics.
He is the gangrene of public affairs. Without presence, education, propriety of life, re
putable occupation, or anything that commends one man to another, if he be' successful
now the party will take him for better or for worse, and will not find, an opportunity in
the future for dropping him. It is now or never. ,

WOMAN WINS BLIND
HUSBAND BY KINDNESS
Romantic Courtship and Marriage of
John H. Shinnick and Miss
Ellen Hayes.
John H. Shinnick, a blind man, living at
79 Natoma street, was married to Miss El
len Hayes of the same address by Justice
of the Peace Dunn yesterday afternoon.
Shinnick is 40 years of age, while â¢ the
bride is 39. .
The groom has been blind for many
'years, and some time ago Miss Hayes,
sympathizing with him in his affliction,
began to pay him those attentions which
only the kind heart knows how to be
stow. - Their acquaintance insensibly
ripened into a tenderer feeling, which
found its sequel at the marriage altar.
When Justice Dunn had performed the
marriage ceremony Shinnlck" offered to
pay the customary fee, which the Justice
refused to accept. -
"I see," said Shinnick, "that you are a
kind-hearted man. Nevertheless you must
accept the fee."
The Justice relented, and this formality
concluded the happy pair departed for
their Natoma-street home, where the
honeymoon will be spent.

TO ARRIVE.
There will be three vessels on the Hilo
route soon fitted with cold storage plants.
The Roderick Dhu has proved such a suc
cess that Caotaln Matson has determined
to install one in the Falls of Clyde. As
soon as that vessel arrives the plant will
be nut aboard and a supply of fruit, veg
etables, fresh meat, fish and game will go
down on her. As soon as the steamer En
terprise comes back from Hilo a refrig
erating plant will be nut Into her and she
will carry a supply of frozen meat to the
islands every trip and bring back nerish
able poods. The Enterprise will get away
about Thursday and will arrive back from
Hilo the first week in September. She
will then be fitted with the cold storage
and an electric light plant.

The John A. Briggs loaded coal at Ta
coma for Bar. Francisco, but when she
came to get a crew Captain Balch found
he was in trouble. The sailors demanded
$60 for the run down the coast and their
passage money back to the Sound. This
demand was refused and the ship was
moved over to Port Townsend. There the
sailors said they would take her down for
$50 and their fare back and later cut that
offer down $10. The owners in San Fran
cisco refused all offers and made arrange
ments to tow the vessel to San Francisco
and send the C. F. Sargent back with the
tug. It was at this point that the Port
Townsend people got in and manned the
ship.
The John A. Briggs is now out six days
from the Sound, and her "A. B.'s" and
"ordinary" seamen are A. M. Sewall, cap
tain and cart owner of the ship Benjamin
Sewall: William Gove, late master of the
Tyee; E. E. Hiokman, ex-ship master and
fo"rmer Chief of Police of Port Townsend;
A C Twe<Â»die, manager of the J. T. Steeb
Shipping Comoany; Frank S. Sheehan of
the Shr-ehan Hardware Company, and B.
C. Pilcher, W. W. Barrett and Chris
Stickr.oth. Before the vessel got away
the union men threatened to cut the tow
line, but thej' did not, and the Briggs got
to sea.
The John A. Briggs is owned by George
E Plummer & Co. of San Francisco. She
is 1933.S7 tons net burden. 234 feet 2 inches
lone 44 feet 10 Inches beam and 20 feet 5
inches deep. She was built in Freeport,
Me., about twenty years ago.
er. The officers are the same as
commanded the ship when she left her<\
but the hands before the mast are ship
captains, ship owners and young business
men of Port Townsend. These latter came
upon the^scene as a result of the Sailors*
Union making demands that the owners
of the Brisgs would not accede to. The
vessel was tied up in consequence, and
sooner than see the place get a bad name
the business . men got together and
manned the vessel themselves.

The JudKe continued the case till to
morrow to hear arguments on the ques
tion of jurisdiction. The defense also de
sires to make a test of the point whether
a bullet from a parlor rifle could carry
such a distance as from where the boys
were shooting to where Wissig was when
the bullet struck him..
Major Hull, judge advocate of the Pre
sidio, appeared for the defendant; and
raised tho question of jurisdiction of the
court tc hear the case. He contended that
as the defendant was on the Government
reservation when firing with his brother
at a target the Federal authorities alone
have jurisdiction in accordance with Sen
ate bill 538 passed four or five years ago.
The case of the boy Eric Kobbe, son
of General Kobbe. charged with assault

JUBISDICTION QUESTIONED
IN ERIC KOBBE CASE
Hancock stubbornly resisted Mrs. Han
cock's demand for $300 a month alimony.
He sought to prove that his income waa
$550 a month, and taxes, insurance and
improvements left but . a small margin.
Judge Seawell, however, concluded that
Mrs. Hancock was entitled to support in
keeping with her station in life, and is
sued the decree as stated. ~~
Hancock's merry times with Mrs. Lei
Wescott, whom he met as a member of a
church choir, furnished Mrs. Hancock
with grounds for divorce. The taking of
testimony proceeded behind closed doors,
though the whole story" had long been
public property. Â»A number of passionate
letters addressed by Hancock to " Mrs.
Wescott were introduced, and these, sup
ported by much oral testimony, all cor
roborative, was accepted by the court as
sufficient grounds upon which to issue a
decree.
Mrs.' EllS 1 ' ."Wood Hancock has been
granted a , divorce from Robert J. Han
cock, the well-known clubman. "With the
decree of divorce an alimony judgment of
substantial proportions Is given by the
court. Judge Seawell, who issued the de
cree, ordered that Hancock pay his
former wife $300 a month for her main
tenance and support, reimburse her law
yers for their labors in proving a case
against him with $1500 and pass over to
her the homestead at 928 Broderick street,
which is worth $20,000.
The committee having the arrangements

The party took in 15.000 "pounds of
fre'jrht with a train of eighteen animals.
They climbed Mount Dana. Mount Lyell

They thought nothing of walking twen
ty-four relies on the last day of the
tramp on the way back into the Yosemite.
and they scaled high mountains with ease.
Others who were on the grand tour of
the mountains were:
This year the Sierra Club had Its first
preneral outing. The party of 300 journeyed
from the Tosemite Valley to the high
Sierras under the general guidance of Sec
retary W. S. Colby, who proved to be
very efficient and lust the right man in
the right place. Going out of the To
semite the ladles of the party used horses
owing to the very steep and rough trails,
but after that they tramped most of the
Time, and they proved excellent moun
taineers. The following named ladies
especially distinguished themselves as
mountain climbers:
Dr. John Mulr. Dr. H. E. Merrtam, Histor
ian Theodore Hlttell, Professors Dudley, Fair
clcugh end Hen&stler of Stanford University.
Professors Soule and nichardson of the Uni
versity of Californlai Professor Joslah KÂ«^p
of Mills Collere, Principal A. C. Olney of the
Fresno Hlirh efliool. William Keith the artist.
Professor J. D. Burks of the Ptate Xormal
School of San DlÂ»go. .Dr. B. P. Wall ct Berke
ley. Dr. John C Spencer of San Francl^cn. Rev.
Kdward L. Parson* of San Mateo; Miss M.
Martin. Â«n Instructor in the State University
Â«f Nevada: Professor MMner Itoberts of Stan
ford University and Rev. Frank S. Brush of
Alamefla.
Probably the most unique mountaineer
ing tour on record In this State has just
coire to an end, and 100 ladles and gen
tlemen, among them professors in two
universities, educators, physicians and
others, have the liveliest memories of ad
ventures in the high Sierras to prompt
them to future deeds of daring. Under the
solemn old pine trees, when the days of
tramping: and camptne \rere drawing to
dusk, nightly around campfires scientific
talks were given, interspersed with songs
and the gayety that belongs to robust,
out-of-door living. There were botanizing
trips and the hunting: of hedgehogs and
other queer animals, with cameras to get
up-to-date photographs of the denizens of
the wilderness.* -

party were the following named:

was unsnarled by Judge Ellsworth this

posed widow of the late j James Johnson'
was entitled to keep property sued for by
the Public Administrator, on the ground
that she was never legally married to the

Mrs. Johnsonâ or, as she Is now entitled
to call' herself,, Mrs. Helen A.' Edgar
testified that she supposed: herself to be
the legal wife of Johnson until in 1897,
when she learned that the supposed wife
of Rev. B.F.: Huddelspn, then president
of the American â¢ Protective , Association,
was adjudged to be Mrs. James A. John
son. She discovered that- this first I wife
had been married by her supposed hus
band in 1872 and had been abandoned by
him. Mrs. * Johnson No. 1 married Hud
delsori in 1885, -and in 1897 sued him ' for

Morgan's intense acting carried the audi

of Sir Christopher Deering, but his rendi
tion of the role was colorless when con

The hearts of the patrons of the Cen
tral Theater overflowed with delight last
night at the exciting and tense situations
of the melodrama, "The Great Diamond
Robbery." The applause at the fall â¢ of
the curtain of each act was deafening
and it had to be raised again and again.
Several times the "gods" fairly shrieked
with delight, and Robert Cummings. who
played the part of Brummage, the detec
tive, met with repeated ovations.. He de
served the showers of applause, as he en
acted the part with rare judgment and
skill. James Corrigan as Senator Mc-
Sorker, the ward boss, gave a very clever
piece of character work, the interpreta
tion being exceedingly lifelike and effec
tive. Howard Scott as Dr. Livingston,
Willard Blackmore as Bulford, Stanley
Ross as Marino and Edwin T. Emery as
Kennett acquitted themselves well. Juliet
Crosby as Mrs. Bulford showed her ver
satility by playing the part. of the "ladv
villain" with marked ability, and in the
final act, when the diamonds she wore at
McSorker's ball exposed her villainy, she
was particularly effective. Georgie Wood
thorpe made an inimitable Mrs. O'Geogan
and Mabel Pennock as Mary Lavelot and
Lillian Elliott as Mother Rosenbaum did
excellent work. The piece is magnificent

There is nothing startlingly new in Miss
Thompson's play as far as the situations
go. There is a flower dance, however, or
iginal and beautiful, that tells with
charming rhythm the story of life, a tale
of happiness, love and destruction. While
in some parts of the play the dialogue
drags, there are some smart lines by
smart women that brighten the situa
tions. There were the usual waits and
drags of the premiere, but. by to-night
the play will probably run more smoothly.
Miss Roberts has cast the play to the full
strength of her company. In the role of
Laura Latimer the star finds a congenial
part. Agnes Rankin is a gentle Mary
Latimer and Marie Howe a smart Mrs.
Terhune. Georgie Cooper rather overdid
Miss Pendraon and Edith Angus was a
trifle too youthful for the awful Mrs.
Tewksbury. White Whittlesey as Gordon
Crevelt, a villain who reforms in the last
act. played with taste and discretion.
George Webster was a painstaking Lati
mer.
The play is well mounted and should do
a good week's, business.
At the end of the third act Miss Thomp
eon came before the curtain, murmured a
few words of thanks and then, pushing
Miss Roberts to the front, looked on ap
provingly while the charming little act
ress neat4y expressed what the authoress
was too nervous to say.

To-night "Otello" will be given, with
the new soprano, Linda Montanari, as
Desdemona, Salassa In his famous role
as Iago, and Castellano as Otello, one of
the best efforts of this conscientious
singer. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Agostini has at once established himself
as perhaps the best tenor of his kind
since Fernando Michelena sang Romeo at
the Tivoli, and though very nervous last
night, showed himself possessed of a
smooth, powerful tenor, admirably culti
vated, and of. superb athletic timbre. He
of course sang the part of Ferdinand,
and was sufficient, from the dramatic as
well as vocal standpoint. Collamarini
appeared as Leonora de Guzman, and
sang her part with characteristic sweet
ness and abandon. Her duet with Fer
rari â Alphonso â was charmingly sung,
though I have heard her in better voice.
Signor Dado was cast as Baldassare, and
his line bass and good stage presence
made a very effective figure of the old
monk. Ferrari as the King was Ferrari,
with perhaps a little less vibrato than
usual in his valuable voice, and Sannie
Kruger is vocally inadequate in the part
of Inez.
"La Favorita," the first appearance of
Agostini, the Tivoll's new tenor, and a
very good cast generally, drew a most ap
preciative and sizable audience to the lit
tle opera-house on Eddy street last night.
"La Favorita" is one of the least hack
neyed of the older operas, and one of the
most tuneful and might better be heard
more frequently, in place of some of the
later operas that compare with it neither
in musical nor dramatic interest. Last
night's performance was not all it might
have been, though the principals were
all in very good form. Some of the cho
rus work was decidedly uncertain, though
much of it was very good, -and the ensem
ble generally will be better to-morrow
evening. "La Favorita" does not sing
itself, like "Alda" and more familiar,
if more difficult, operas, and needs, there-'
fore, even fuller rehearsal. To-morrow
evening, then, the work will be surer, and
with Mr. Steindorff's cleverly handled or
chestra, "La Favorita" will be better
heard. ...
This is why Burlingame is perturbed;

Buriingame is stirred from clubhouse to
golf links. The aristocratic calm that is
characteristic of the placeâ a calm that
has been mistermed "dullness" by certain
iconoclastsâ has given way to intense ex
citement, and things in the exclusive
suburb now move round with the rapidity
of a roulette wheel at a country fair.
The reason for all this is the fact that
a stranger has gone into business at Bur
llngame. His specialty is house-cleaning,
and the principal implements of his trade

his industry at Burlingame has excited

FALL RIVER, Mass., Aug. 12.â The Fall
River cotton manufacturers this evening
at a meeting for the purpose of discussing
the work of reduction unanimously voted
to reduce wages to a basis of 17 cents for
weaving, the reduction to go into effect
September 3. This is about a 14 per cent
cut,' the present price of weaving being
19.8 cents. The vote was unanimous with
one exception, this man voting against the
reduction only on the question as to the
amount. An agreement will be drawn up
for signature and will be passed by the
executive committee of the association. It
will require a representation of 100,000
spindles to make an agreement to reduce
wages operative. At the meeting and vot
ing this evening there were representa
tives of nearly 1,250,000 spindles.
Representatives of the various labor or
ganizations in Fall River met directly
after the announcement of the action of
the Manufacturers' Association and a
meeting of the Textile Council was called
for next Thursday night. At that meeting
a plan of action and perhapsof resistance
will be formulated.
In regard to the adoption of a sliding
scale, which was agitated some time ago.
it is not expected that the operatives will
accept it. Â¦ v â¢â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦
The operatives on every hand to-night
talked over the movement of the associa
tion, Â«and the sentiment seemed In favor
of resisting.
BERKELEY, Aug. 12.-Word has been
received from Lowden Ranch, Trinity
County, which will probably solve the
mystery of the disappearance of Henry
Pearson, who dropped out of sight In
West Berkeley three weeks J ago to-day.
A man answering Pearson's description
commenced work on the ranch there on
August 1, about the time it would have
taken the missing man to have reached
that place. He gave his name as Henry
Peterson and his home as San Francisco,
but has given no Information regarding
his past life.
- Mrs. Pearson, after reading the descrip
tion of the "Peterson" in Trinity county,
furnished her by The Call, declared the
man was undoubtedly her husband. Me
is working with a friend, N. Anderson,
and Mrs. Pearson says that she knew
he had an acquaintance by that name.
She has communcated with the managers
at Lowden'and is awaiting an answer.
Pearson, at the time of his disappear
ance, was residing at S0O Cortland ave
nue, San Francisco. He left home Sun
day. July 21, taking with him all of the
money there was in the house, about $100,
and., leaving his wife and four children
in destitute circumstances. The next
morning he appeared in West Berkeley
and borrowed $25 from his brother-in
law, I. A. Crowther. Police and private
detectives have been working on the case,
but to no -avail.- An article published in
The Call of July 30 giving a picture and
description of Pearson has led to the
coupling of the Trinity county "Peter
son" with the missing man. >.'â¢
BAY COUNTIES FRANCHISE
REFUSED BY TRUSTEES
Matter Probably "Will Come Up
Again Next Week in Amended
Form.
BERKELEY, Aug. 12.â The Town Trus
tees refused to pass the resolution to
night granting a forty-nine year fran
chise to the Bay Counties Company to
run its lines through this city. The fran
chise' as It stood was objected to on the
ground that the town would receive no
benefit from it for five years. Trustees
Turner and Ryder advocated reducing tl?e
time of the franchise from forty-nine to
twenty-five years. It will come up at the
next meeting for another consideration.
A motion was passed to raise the tele
phone company's license from $20 a year
to $100, the company to furnish the city
with free telephones for the Town Hall,
fire houses and Marshal's office. This will
make 'the company's license practically
$50 a month, i

Ancient Order of "Workmen.
At the meeting of Magnolia Lodge, A.
O. IT. W., on the 5th inst., the lodge
closed under the head of good and wel
fare and a committee presented an inter
esting programme for the entertainment"
of the members, many of whom had re
sponded to an invitation to . "be present
and have a good time." Master Joe, the
youngest son of ex-District Deputy Cun
ningham, gave evidence of musical talent
by a vocal solo; N. Fallek favored with
vocal selections; R. N. Walsh entertained
with selections on the xylophone, ocarina
and saxophone, the performance being
warmly applauded. Then followed â¢ inter
esting addresses by Brothers Cunning
ham, Brind, Haley and Cohen. Magnolia
will have another entertainment on the
2d of September, and it extends an invi
tation to all members of the order to be
present.
Frank F. Terramose, past master work
man of Crocker Lodge, was, on the 2d
inst., presented by the lodge a very hanfl
some gold badge of the rank he holds in
the order, in recognition of his zeal for
the order and the work he has done for
the lodge,- he having brought into It
more than twenty members. The presen
tation on behalf of the lodge was by
Grand Recorder T. C. Spencer. During
the evening the 'lodge had work in the
conferring of degrees.
Unity Lodge on the 6th inst. had a
house warming in Elks' Hall, into which
it recently moved. The hall, profusely
decorated, was filled to repletion by ladies
and - gentlemen, and an excellent pro
gramme was presented. There were selec
tions by an orchestra; vocal selections by
Ethel Lucas, M. Denis, R. Jones, C. L.
Freld and Viola Gibson; recitation by Al
H. Hallett; instrumental selections by
Professor Greber's Mandolin Club, and an
addref>3 by Past Grand Recorder D. S.
Hirshberg. Master Workman C. A.
O'Brien was master of ceremonies. After
the programme there was dancing till
midnight. Among the notables i present
were Deputy Grand Master W. H. Barnes
and Grand Recorder C. T. Spencer.
On account of the declination of the
foreman elect of Valley Lodge to serve,
on the ground of business engagements
on meeting nights, there was a change
of officers on the 7th inst. Overseer Til
den was promoted foreman, Guide Allen
was promoted overseer, Brother Eldridge
was promoted guide, and Brother Doug
lass was elected inside watchman. Ow
ing to the inability of the district deputy
to be present, these officers were Installed
by Deputy Grand Master Barnes. The

Brains at Their Best.
Research has proved that the human
mind is at its fullest power between the
ages of 40 and 60. There are, of course,
exceptions to the rule, such as Byron, the
young Napoleon and Alexander, but tak
ing it "full and by" the prime age of the
mind of man is between 40 and 60. Swift
was 43 when he wrote "Gulliver's Trav
els," and John Stuart Mill 5S when hl3
essay on "Utilitarianism" was- published,
although his "Liberty" was written three
years before. When "Waverley" came
out Sir Walter Scott was 44 years old, and
nearly all of those tales which have made
his lasting fame as a novelist were writ
ten after he was 46. Milton's genius made
its loftiest flights when he was between 54
and 59. It was between those years that
he wrote "Paradise Lost." "The Task"
and "John Gilpln" were written when
Cowper was over 50, and Defoe was within
two years of 60 when he wrote "Robinson
Crusoe." Of all the writings of Thomas
Hood "The Song of the Shirt" and "The
Bridge of Sighs" are the best known and
will live the longest. Hood wrote those
two poems at the age of 46. \ ~
Darwin wrote his "Origin Of Species"
when he was 50. and was 62 when he gave
to the world his "Descent of Man." Long
fellow wrote "Hiawatha" at 48, and Oliver
"Wendell Holmes gave us "Songs In Many
Keys" when he had passed his fifty-firth
birthday. â Chicago Journal.

Catarrh is a constitutional disease â a blood disease which is frequently
inherited, and only a blood medicine, such as S. S. S., can remove the hereditary
taint, destroy the poisons that have been accumulating in the system for years
perhaps, and restore the blood to a healthy and pure condition. The inflamed
membranes and diseased glands are healed by the rich, pure blood which is carried
to them, and the offensive discharges from the nose, and the terrible headache and
neuralgic pains cease. Chronic cases of the most desperate character and apparent
ly hopeless,' have been cured completely and permanently by the use of S. S. S.

three running races. Alta Vela, S. A.
Hooper's fine bay stallion, took the first
event in three straight heats in 2:17%, 2:16

THE INVAI>EE EASILY
WINS THE SECOND EACE
. CHICAGO, Aug. 12.â In a twelve-knot
breeze and a smooth sea the Invader, the
Royal Canadian Yacht Club's challenger,
won the second race of the Internationa!
series for the Canada's cup almost as eas
ily as the defender, the Detroit Boat
Club's Cadillac, won the first race last
Saturday.
The Invader gained 4 minutes 27 seconds
on -what was intended to be a beat to
windward of nine nautical miles, but
which, by reason of the wind hauling be
rore the yacht had made two miles- to
weather, became a close-hauled reach
and on the run home off the wind the
challenger added 2 minutes more to her
lead. The elapsed time was: Invader.
3:08; Cadillac, 3:14:22.
To-morrow's race will be over the tri
angular course, as on Saturday.

To Officers of Election: You are hereby noti
fied that in tallying the votes for any name
on the pasters you must be guided by the
heading on the official ballot and not by the
heading- on the paster. For Instance, if the
heading of the official ballot should read
Democratic party, and should have a Repub
lican paster below, you must mark the ballot
void, as there are more candidates than are
allowed by the apportionment. On the ether
hand, if an official ballot should read Repub
lican party and the 'Â¦ paster should Â¦ contain
Democratic candidates.- nevertheless you must
tally the votes for such candidates in the Re
publican page of the tally sheet by 1 writing: In
the names so voted, as the official- ballot and
not . the paster determines the political com
plexion of the candidate printed thereon. A
strict compliance with this law will be insisted
on. THOMAS J. WALSH.
, Registrar oC Voters.
Thomas J. Walsh, Registrar of Voters,
has made a ruling relative to tallying the
votes of candidates where the, official bal
lot and the paster do not agree. In re
sponse to many inquiries as to the law on
this subject the Registrar has issued the
following instructions:
ISST7ES FINAL INSTRUCTIONS.
Knocking at Prison Door.
Kelly and Crimmina have evolved a
scheme to cast illegal votes. Last night
their agents were busy In the Thirtieth
District passing out slips which contained
the names of people who formerly resided
In hotels and lodging-houses and have
changed their residence since the last
election. These people would on the face
be entitled to vote on account of their
former registration. A list of fifteen
names was secured in the Windsor Hotel
and the Kelly and Crimmins push were
searching last night for men who wou'd
take a chance of reaching San Quentin
by attempting to vote them.
Before daylight on the morning of Au
gust 2 O'Brien was lying doubled up
among his bed clothes, when the guards
noticed a convulsive jerking of his limbs.
He was carried out and water thrown
upon his face to restore him to conscious
ness. A towel was tightly twisted around
his neck, and between this and the skin
he had twisted his hands in such a man
ner as to completely prevent breathing.
He was strangling when attention was
drawn to him. An hour later he sud
denly jumped off the bed headlong to the
floor in an evident attempt to snap hi"
neck or crush his skull. He was seriously
injured, but recovered "under a doctor's
care. ..

O'BRIEN TWICE TRIES
TO COMMIT SUICIDE
LAST nirht the fact came to the;
knowledge of the Primary League
that boeeÂ«s were secretly circu
lating caads containing names of
registered citizens to be voted by
rounders immediately on the opening of
the polls this morning. Officers of the
law were apprisÂ«jd of the contemplated
perjury and false impersonation and war
rants were at ones prepared for the ar
rest of such offenders.
Registrar Walsh desires The Call to
state that election officers have been In
structed to require every voter who ob
tains a ballot to sign the roll. If instruc
tions are obeyed no Tsallot will be issued
until the voter signs. Election officers
may not fully comprehend the instruc
tions in this respect, hence they are ad
vised to be very careful. Early this morn
ing disputes may arise on this point. The
ruling of the Registrar is clear. The law
requires the voter's signature, and the law
should be respected by the precinct
boards.
The Republican Primary League intends
to see that perjurers are sent to San
Quentin. The league has made a splendid
campaign, but its resources are not ex
hausted. It possesses the power and de
teimiration to promptly procure the nec
essary proof to convict rounders who may
be guilty of false impersonation and per
jury in to-day's election. Kelly and Crim
rcins may have a pull, but they will need
it to save themselves if this great city
Ehai; to-day become aroused to a sense of
civic duty.
Appeal to Good Citizens.
Every registered workingman. mer
chant, business man and property
owner of Republican faith who neglects
to-day to attend the election and cast
a vote for the delegates proposed by the
Primary League will fall short of his
duty as an honest, courageous citizen. A
vote for the Kelly-Crimmins ticket is a
vote to surrender the control of municipal
affairs to corrupt bosses.
Circulars and rumors that the laboring
men are opposed to the Republican Pri
mary League are false. It is true that
the labor organizations which contem
plate the placing In the 'field of a labor
ticket to be voted for at the municipal
election have advised their members to
refrain from voting to-day, because they
Â¦cannot subsequently exercise the right of
petition for a place on the ballot if they
have voted for delegates to a convention.
No doubt many laboring men will respect
the requests of their respective organiza
tions and refrain from voting to-day.
Last night President Sullivan and Treas
urer Richardson of the Longshoremen'?
Association visited the headquarters of
the Republican Primary League and pos
itively denied the rumor that the unions
were against the league ticket. On tl'e
contrary they asserted that they were in
favor of the ticket. For example Thomas
Westoby. secretary of the City Front Fed
eration, heads the league ticket in . the
Twenty-eighth District. liis opponent en
the other ticket is Martin Kelly, the arch
boss. It is a vile slander on honest work
ingmen to assert that they are giving
support to Kelly and Crimmins and other
degraded bosses.
Thirty-Third District.
Timely addresses were made at a rous
ing meeting of the Thirty-third District
Republican Primary League Club last
evening at Maennerbund Hall, near the
corner of Potrero avenue and Twenty
fourth street. Captain C. D. Douglas pre
sided. On the platform were the candi-
were present. Chairman J. C. KImball
presided.
After the overture by the band and the
call to order L. A. Rea delivered an ad
dress in English and Italian. He called
attention to the disgraceful politics being
done by the Kelly push and of the efforts
made by the better element of the party
to rid the organization of the bosses. He
urged his hearers to stand by the Primary
League ticket and with their help to-tiay
he was confident of success.
Â¦ Abe Ruef was the next speaker. He
discussed the issues of the preliminary
campaign in a vigorous and fearless man
ner. He' characterized the fight as .being
one not for men but principle. It was a
struggle of men for the right of voicing
their own sentiments irrespective of the
commands of a political boss. It was a
battle to throw off the shackles of a de
grading political slavery. .
Mr. Ruef denied the statements of A.
K. Daggett, Dr. C. A. Glover and others
made at a recent meeting concerning his
connection with the .Primary League
movement. He declared that their state
ments were a tissue of falsehoods. He
denied that the men advanced by the
league were job chasers, and he proved
conclusively that the men most active in
Kelly's behalf were themselves spoil
hunters. Mr. Ruef said further, amid ap
plause, that The Call was backing t ho
league movement because its proprietor,
John D. Spreckels, was desirous of purify
ing politics in this city.
"I say now upon my honor," remarked
Mr. Ruef, "that Mr. Spreckels is in this
fight purely in the interests of the Kepub
lican party and that not the slightest hope
of reward was held out to him in order
that the backing of his great paper might
be secured. Because of. this support the
creatures in the employ of Kelly have cir
culated false rumors concerning him, all
of which were inspired by hatred for liis
paper and malice against the purity of hts
motives."
In closing Mr. Ruef cautioned his audi-
ence to vote the league ticket if it was
their desire to rid themselves of the cor
rupt domination of the foul-smelling car
rion known as Boss Kelly.
D. W. Burchard made a brief address
in which he urged the voters of the Forty
fourth District to stand firm for honest
government by voting the league ticket.
The audience then dispersed with three
cheers for the league and a tiger for Mr.
Ruef.
rule should go to the polls early and vote
for the delegates, indorsed by the Primary
League. Pay no heed to ticket venders
handling other tickets. All the signs
point to a sweeping anti-boss victory at
the polls to-day. If citizens do their duty
the bosses will be beaten out of sight.
MANILA, Aug. 12.-Civil Governor Taft
in the immediate future will reduce the
police force of Manila by J one-half, i Â¦ At
present there are 1300 policemen for the
city, whose population numbers only 250,
000 souls. The Governor considers it un
necessary to have over 600 policemen, as
they are not- required for military pur
poses. | Besides in the event of trouble the
policemen of Manila would be unable to
cope with the situation and the military
forces- would have to be called upon.

The Republican Primary League Club
of the Forty-fourth Assembly District
qnÂ« a TJÂ°n Slng: meetln & Washington
??+ e , *i? 11 at Unlon and Stockton streets
last night. About 1000 men and women
The allied bosses, headed by Kelly and
Crimmins and backed by an unsavory
gang, of, opium fiends and disreputable
loafers, are resorting to fraud and trick
ery to deceive the voters of the Forty
third District. Yesterday circulars were
distributed Â¦ throughout the district. The
words "Home Rule! . Anti-Boss!" are
printed in conspicuous letters near the top
of the circular, and the names on the
Kelly-Crlmmins ticket of delegates are
printed below. The only, anti-boss ticket
in the Forty-third District is that put for
ward by the Republican Primary League
The corrupt bosses are trying to mislead
voters by putting "home rule and anti
boss on the campaign circulars. The
true anti-boss ticket is . published else
where in to-day's Call. Citizens should
compare the names published in the paper
with those printed on the paster Affix
the paster containing the Republican Pri
mar .y , Lea S ue . names to the official ballot.
In this district, and particularly in the
S S etl ? J \ S0Uth u of Bush street/citizens
sh r^ ld T, be _. on their Suard against fraud
The Registrar should instruct officers to
keep a sharp lookout in the north end of
the Forty-third. The Call receives in
formation that the Libertv lodging-housp
on -Broadway, has been stuffed .and I that
a Democratic politician well known in the
district proposes to vote the stuffers to
day. History may repeat itself. Men
have been sent to San Quentin for fraud
ulent voting., in. the Forty-third. The
bternberg case should furnish campaign
literature for Kelly and Crimmins men?
After the election, the Primary League
will assist the authorities in sending to
the penitentiary m*n who may be gfiilty
of fraudulent voting. All the resources
at the command of the league will be em
ployed to expose and punish the guilty
Forty-Third District.
In the Forty-first Assembly District the
campaign against Kelly, Crimmins and
other corrupt bosses is being directed by
the Horace Davis Republican Club. The
club has a splendid anti-boss record The
purpose of the organization is to keep
alive the spirit of municipal progress and
advocate the principles of good local jTov
ernment under the auspices of the Re
publican party. It has nominated repre
sentative menâ citizens of character and
independence-for delegates to the mu
nicipal nominating convention. Everv
good Republican of the Forty-first should
go to the polls to-day and vote for the
delegates proposed by the Horace Davis
Club and indorsed by the Republican Pri-
rorty-First District.
This is no time for citizens to shirk or dodge an issue that the bosses have placed squarely up to the peoole of
this metropolis. Every citizen with a spark of courage, who feels the glow of civic" pride, will accept the challenge of
the boss and express his sentiments at the election to-day. Only the wavering, the weak and the irresolute will Â«t*l ?
home and say, "I den't want to mix up in primary politics."- a> ; at
It is likewise true that the opposition to the Republican Primary League is sustained by Martin Kelly Phil Cri
mins and others cf their kind. It is up to the citizens to express a choice at the primary election to-day. It is u to
the citizens to ask themselves questions concerning the character of the men mentioned. Are these men whom the bosses
condemn honorable, industrious and law-abiding citizens of the community? Â«
Are they concerned in the prosperity and welfare of. this great city of San Francisco? Do they pav taxes nnrl
fulfill other obligations of citizenship? Do they respect the rights of their fellow citizens and employ their energies and
influence to better thÂ£ conditions and surroundings of their fellow men? . .
If the people o'f San Francisco' believe that John D. Spreckels, Vanderlynn Stow and M. H. de Toung are good citl
zens. who are fairly representative of the citizenship of San Francisco, then the Primarv League which ronrpsont- wi
cf their standing in the community, should be sustained in the election to-day. ' ' citizens
Let the people of San Francisco, divesting their minds of all prejudice and passion, ask themselves seriouslv th^o
questions: What manner of man is Martin Kelly? What .good influence does he possess? What . has he done to n
mote the protxPerity of San Francisco? Is he a man of honor and integrity? Does his presence in the community kT
ttr the condition of society? miy Dei "
Is he anything more than a political boss who derives revenue from creatures of his kind who find employment
in the public service? "Would the success of a ticket representing men of his character reflect honor on the city'
If a voter believes that Martin Kelly is the type of man to represent San Francisco, let him vote the tirk*Â»t n
posed to the Prtnary League. . lL " LeL op "
p^rjS HE unprincipled character of the opposition to the Republican Primary League is exemplified In a circular of
I which the foregoing is very nearly a fac simile. Thousands of these circulars were distributed last night on
I the public streets of this city by the agents of Kelly and Crimmins. Â¦
II If ttie issue is thus defined let all the people comprehend the definition. Shall the government of the citv
represent such men as John D. Spreckels, Vanderlynn Stow and M. H. de Young or shallit represent such as
Martin "Kelly and-Ph.il Crimmins? It is true that the Primary League is sustained by John D. Spreckels" Vanderlvnn
