decided that those who had '. helped ' to
build . the road and had given the best
years of their Hires to its . success Â¦ should
be retired upon pensi#s. " The first to "be
affected under this agreement was Man
ager J. A. Fillmore. and the second Steph
en T. Gage. The first was. the head of
the operating department and -the second
the head of the Internal political machin
ery of the company.
The services of Mr. Gage during the last
few years have been purely. nominal,, but
there was . no man who. was ever . con
nected with the Southern Pacific Com
pany and the . Central Pacific Railroad
Company, - not even - excepting Stanford
and - Huntington -themselves, who did
more work for- those corporations than
Stephen T. Gagei He has but a very mod
est fortune and he is devoted to his fam
ily. "While In perfect physical health, Mr.
Gage is well along in years. His wife
died some years ago, since which {line
his life has Centered around his children,
to whom he is a most devoted father.
It is said in this connection that J. A.
Fillmore Is not in the best of health and
that it Is doubtful if he could have stood
the strain of another year's work in the
position from which he has Just retired.

string this morning. The end was In the
air yesterday. Men who have hugged a
kicking rifle for seven days and shot hun
dreds and hundreds of times at the black
spots . on the buff sat around the tables
and passed confidences, told of other
shooting festivals and how incomparably
superior this was to . any and all of Its
predecessors. On the faces of many sat
bleak disappointment. The fortunate ones
jn the work at the ranges looked happy
and contented. To them the prizes they
will carry away were the only burdens
and these are burdens that will bring
nothing but pleasure to the happily op
pressed. Medals, gold and silver, flashed
on every side. It was an army of men
with .'shining chesty decorations.
Completely satisfied with their West
ern trip, the visitors 'of the third Na
tional Festival would like to return to^<
San Francisco three years hence on Just
such a similar occasionâ not entirely be
cause the hospitality and courtesy of the
local clubs have been so warm and genu
ine and freely given, but also because the
conditions, for good shooting are more
pronounced.
Dave McLaughlin entertained a small
coterie in the shooting gallery yesterday
with tales- of the New York festival three
years ago. ; He told how the lightning
played up and down the gun barrels of
the shooters and how the heat was -so
oppressive that the men dressed decollete
above the waist and in the thinnest of
duck below. He was used to full clothes
and could not shoot In a net 'undershirt
without its usual dress covering. So he
suffered the heat,, but shot . with coat,
vest and shirt. Theodore Geisel and Harry
Pope semed to steam under the recollec
tion of it. Yes, they all agreed California
was the best place for a shoot, and as an
exemplar they ran over the rccord3 of the
shooting.

On the standard American target Theo
dore Geisel distinguished himself yester
day and will probably carry off the first
prize. He shot 43 out of a posible 50,' and
as he has two 43 cards and one 47 to back
this score up, there is little likelihood of
any one else coming In to steal away the
honors and the prizes. Adolph Strecker
has 49 also, but he Is not backed up. by
any such .big scores as those against
Geisel's name. A. H. Pape has 49 backed

his eyes were those 3M points and the
kingship. It is no easy matter .for a man
to shoot against* a' 1 ' new .world's record,
and such a. towering one at that. 'Ittel's
nerve was. consummate. He Is easily the
greatest rifle performer at Shell Mound,
and although he will not wear the crown
not one- of the. shooters at Shell Mound
fails to recognize -him as a man of iron
nerve and self-control far beyond that of
any marksman who has j ever shot pub
licly in this or any country.
MASON'S ARITHMETIC,

Strecker and' Ittel are. the exalted, the
men whose names rise from the glasses
after every toast. F. E. Mason has been
toppled over.- Since his eventful perform
ance on Frfday last, when his steady
nerve, keen eye and Imperturbable com
posure at the butts brought him Into view
as a strong candidate for the purple, both
Mason and : all his friends have labored
under a grievous mistake. Mason was
only a king by the charity of his ; own
false! addition. Â¦Â¦ At no time since Friday
night did he have the gllmmerof a chance
to top Strecker's score.. When he' finished
shooting on Sunday afternoon Mason had
to his credit 295 points, and not 312. Fur
thermore, instead of having four full
strings left he had but three and six shots
of the .fourth.' -He wound up his strings
yesterday/ morning, . getting on the four
tickets' respectively 20,' 17, 16 and,23. Ma
son's complete score Is '371. -Even as It
was, he went to pieces. Racked -with the
tension and strain, he: fell from, shooting
grace and, dropping back In the ruck, fin
ished" below others whom it, was thought
he could not ' help but surpass."- So . the

At l.ioth points, which are considered by
each side to be the strike centers, the sit
ution remains in statu quo. Neither of the
parties to the controversy has made any
decided move. From the other Important
point. Duncansville, conflicting reports are
received and the result of the quiet strug
gle going on between the American Steel
Hoop Company and the Amalgamated As
sociation is still uncertain, with the com
pany's chances probably better for win
.nine in the end.
Laie this afternoon the Amalgamated
Association issued its first strike bulletin
from the general offices. The bulletin
gives an outline of the conditions pre
vailing and reproduces abstracts of Pres
ident Shaffer's recent addresses at Wells
ville and McKeesport. In the most prom
inent part of the bulletin is printed the
â¢warning -words, "Do. not drink, especially
if the trust tries to break the strike by
importing non-union men. Don't believe
any one who says the mills will be closed
forever or taken out of the community If
you <3on't go to work."
Further on are the words: "There
were not enough men in the country to
run the mills before the strike, so all you
need tc do to win the strike is, don't work.
Knjoy your summer shutdown. It means
more work next winter. This is not the
time for mill work, anyhow."
Absolute denial was made by President
Shaffer of a story that a delegation from
the Vandergrlft, mills of the- American
Sheet Steel Company had been Irj confer
ence, with him. He said he had seen no
one from Vandergrift and knew/ nothing
of their presence in Pittsburg or-\McKees
port. Whatever is being done by the
Amalgamated people at Vandergrlft is be
ing kept so quiet at present that few of
the general officials of the order are ac
quainted with the status, of affairs.
There has beÂ£n no change in the arbi
tration or mediation movements so far as
the officials of the association are aware.
The hope is general among these offi
cials, however, that a way will be found
to bring about a settlement of the diffi
culties.
President Shaffer has not yet declared
that there was no possibility of concern
on the part of the Amalgamated Associa
tion. When he was asked for his opinion
on thiÂ« matter to-day he replied that he
Â¦was unable to answer the question.
Friends of the president who have talked
to him on this line express the firm be
lief that if the proper steps were taken
the manufacturers would' find the associ
ation in a conciliatory mood and ready tor
meet any reasonable proposition consis
tent with honor. They say the whole
tone of President Shaffer's remarks is In
clined toward peace if he can secure it
.honorably.

The district of Hamakua, Hawaii, has
been visited by a large cane fire, causing
over $25,000 loss. It is supposed .to have
been started, by a camper two weeks ago
and to have been slowly working its way
towards the Ookala cane fields since then,
unseen by those on the plantation. It
broke out last week and destroyed be
tween eighty- and eighty-five acres of
young cane. It burned about 800 acres of
forest and swept over a large tract of
coffee land owned by Homer Bros., who
are the heaviest losers, except the Terri
tory, in the matter of forest. At last ac
counts the fire was still burning, though
It was reported controlled. The destruc
tion of the forest is greatly regretted, as
much attention has been given lately to
increasing the growth of trees throughout
the Islands. Â¦ /..Â¦., â¢;j.--:

diplomatic squabble over | the possession
of ordnance left by the Spanish troops
in Cuba at. the time of their evacuation of

This claim was advanced by the Spanish'
Commissioners in Cuba at the time they
were making arrangements with v the
American Commissioners for the evacu

the Spaniards, holding- : that .under,. -the
Spanish law all movable property became
immovable property, that ' fortifications

hence immovable property.; ' : . -

missioner Roekhill cabled the State De
partment to-day that the foreign Ministers
at Peking had finally decided on a plan
for the payment of the Indemnity to the'
powers by the Chinese Government. Bonds
will be issued to each power to the value
of its claims. These bonds will begin to
draw Jnterest from 1902.- It is intended
that the principal and interest shall be
entirely paid by 1940.
The plan â¢ involves an annual disburse
ment of 23,000.0^0 taels. Of this sum 18.
000.000 taels will be used the first year to
defray the interest charges. The balance
will be converted Into a sinking fund, out
of which the principal will be liquidated.
- As the principal is paid off in annual in
stallments the indebtedness will decrease,
and the amount of interest that will have
to bo paid will consequently be less each
year. In regard to the method by which
China shall raise this money the State
.Department has not yet advised.
Great Britain has accepted the Russian
proposal for increasing the customs duty
to ten per cent silver. The authorities are
awaiting a counter proposition from
I>or.don suggesting a compromise of about
ly* per cent. Under the instructions given
Roekhill he is charged to assent to the
imposition of this duty.

VISALJA. July 22.â Horticultural . Com
missioner O. S. Riley said to-day that tho
pear orchards of the San Joaquin Valley
would soon be things of the past unless
some means could be devised to check the
ravages of a disease known as pear
blight. He said that nine-tenths of tha
orchards of Kings and Fresno counties
were affected.
The blight is spreading through the Tu
lare County orchards at an alarming rate.
It attacks the buds first and then works
backward to the branch and trunk. It Is*
the most serious menace the fruit-growers
of this section have ever been called upon
to face.

Waxsmith has a bad record in this
county. Six weeks ago he attempted to
run Ventura for a day, but was promptly
placed under arrest by Constable Rus
sell, after a hard fight. Russell came
out of the affray slightly disfigured about
the face. Only a short time ago Wax
smith created a row In the town of .Ox

John Bottoms this morning pleaded
guilty, to a charge of disturbing the peace.
Judge Titus 'imposed- a.' fine of $50, which
was paid. H., "W. .Weekly, pleaded guilty

Gregg and Waxsmith, the latter of
whom shot Mayor O'Hara, will be taken
to Santa Paula to-morrow morning.
Gregg and Weekly are likely to be fined
heavily. ..-.-.
Indignation grows as events leading to
the tragedy are becoming* known. It was
learned to-day that a Mexican had a
narrow escape 'from death in -the Cerf sa
loon late Saturday night. The rioting ma
chinists were all in this house when the
Mexican entered to obtain a drink. Wax
smith wantonly fired, upon, him, the bul
let passing within a few inches of his
head. The stranger - and another Mexi
can were badly- beaten.
Constable Beard is bitterly denounced
for having refused to arrest the rioters
on the ; ground that he had no warrant.
The arrests were finally made by citizens.
VENTURA, July 22.â Feeling still runs
high in Santa Paula over the shooting of
Mayor Paul O'Hara by rioters yesterday,
and there is a probability that should the
Mayor's wound prove fatal the populace
will not wait for the slow-going and un
certain law to wreak vengeance upon his
assassin. The., chances are, greatly
against the recovery of the wounded man.
As "yet a big piece of bullet In his head
has not been- found. He passed a restless
night and was very weak to-day. Charles
Waxsmith, who fired the shot that may
cause the Mayor's death, Is still in jail
here, and precautions are being taken to
prevent an attempt to" take him from hia

trees, when he was finally overtaken- by
members of a header crew led by the
father of the boy. The horse in Its wild

of his counsel, Judge C. S. Johnson,
Schneider also let lays, and his laymen
were put in possession, there being thirty

Perish.es in the Breakers.
Mrs. Mellmore. wife of Captain William
Mellmore. was drowned In the surf at the
mouth of Sinrock River on June 26. while
the captain was attempting to make a
landing during the prevailing storm.
Captain Mellmore and his wife, during
the month of April, went to Bridget
Creek on a prospecting- tour. They were
returning- from there in an open boat and
had safely made the distance along the
coast from Port Clarence Bay around the
point, when they encountered a heavy
gale. It is supposed that, fearing to risk
it any further. Captain Mellmore, who is a.
thorough navigator attempted to make
the mouth of Sinrock River. At any rate
when they got into the breakers the boat
was capsized and before the captain could
rescue his wife t?he was drowned and car
ried away by the undertow.
Mrs. Millmore was a Miss Fulcomer,
formerly of Kansas. She was noted for
her literary accomplishments, having con
tributed many interesting and historical
articles to the leading: magazines of the
States. In iBSei Bhe went to the Yukon as
teacher for one of ihe Government schools
at Circle City, vhich post she filled with
marked ability for about one year. She
then returned to the States and came
back to the Yukon ag-ain the following
year, and in the fall of 1899 she was mar

collector cf customs at Fort Yukon. The
couple moved to Fort Yukon, remained

Heavy Gambling in Nome.
Dawson in Us palmiest days never saw
any higher bet* made on one turn of the
card than have been witnessed In two
plays in Nome this week. The first play
rame utj at the Dexter when "Bull Con"
Jack and Gus Seiffert attempted to put
\\yatt Earp and Charlie Hoxsie out of
business in a few turns. "Bull Con" made
several stiff bets, and with his usual luck,
won. and the dealer did not cut him down
until he attempted to bet $1000. It was
lucky for lhe dealer, as Jack won his $500
bet. and for some time that was the
u.=ual en a single card.
There was another stiff plav in tha
Northern when four gamblers pooled
together in order to win out enough to
Ftake themselves to a bank roll. They
started in with $S0 bets, which is the
usual limit m the Northern, and then
commenced to double, winning every bet
until they had 11050 in checks out. They
then stacked them all up on the ace and
asked the dealer to turn for the bunch
but before doinjer no the dealer asked
Proprietor James Murphy if he would
"stand for it." Â¦ â¢
"Let the boyÂ« put on as much as they
want and if the ceiling is too low we'll
tear it off." said Murphy.
"With that the dealer wet his finger and
clipped off a card. It was a great big
bullet, and four disgusted sports walked
out of the house.
A. R, Macadams, nicknamed "Checkers,"
was cne of the first prospectors to visit
Kougarok district. He was "grub
staked" by Chris Schneider, who claims
to have advanced $8000 or $10,000 In alL
Recently Schneider learned that "Check
ers" had sold his Kougarok claims, the
purchasers being a San Francisco syndi
cate composed of Count Podhorski, A. J.
Brander. E. J. Harlow and M. T. Brander.
The consideration is alleged to have been.
55000 cash and $80,000 on bedrock.
"Checkers" got the money, squandered
some of It and departed. Schneider heard
of the reported sale and immediately re
corded the "grubstake" contract he had
with Macadams, by which Schneider was
to receive a half interest in everything:
staked by "Checkers."
NOME, July 3.â Twenty men, "armed to

Quartz and other creeks to attempt to

claims on behalf of a San Francisco syn

started with a posse, heavily armed, with
the intention of reaching the claims
ahead of the San Franciscans and giving
them a warm reception. News of a battle

The condition obtaining in the business
district yesterday was a tie-up more or
less complete of all those industries
dependent to a greater- or less degreo on
tho services of the draymen. 'Where hun
dreds of trucks daily rumbled, few were
to be seen. On thft wharves large ship
ments of fruit awaited removal, but the
teamsters refused to haul them and it
â¢was found necessary to send large quan
tities to Oakland for sale over there. Any
body who had the means to carry off the
stock could get fruit for a mere song.
Demonstrations by Teamsters. .
Early In the day demonstrations were
made by the teamsters, and some of the
men driving wagons and trucks left them
in the streets without delivering tho
loads. Secretary Renner of the Draymen's
Association telephoned to police head
quarters for assistance and officers were
detailed to escort the wagons to their
destinations. Even this precaution â¢< did
not prevent a general stoppage of busi
ness. ' ,
John Law, an old man, who has been
employed as a teamster for many years
on the water front, endeavored to move
a largo lot of goods. At the. corner of
East and Market- streets a heavy case fell
As a result of this ukase, President
Tilden and Treasurer Fuller took off their
coats and managed to move a quantity of
goods, but their efforts would not win
them distinction as teamsters.
When the matter was called to the at
tention of Collector of the Port Stratton
yesterday, he notified Charles L. Tilden,
the president of the company, and J. V.
Fuller, the treasurer, that the goods must
be removed from the wharves to the
Appraiser's warehouse at once, and If
necessary the United States would place
guards upon the wagons to prevent any
interference with the drivers.
UNCX.E SAM may be "Casey at
the bat" before the trouble be
tween the teamsters and their
employers is settled. The
Overland Freight and Transfer
Company, which has a contract with the
United States Government to haul bonded
goods from the wharf to the warehouse,
has been deprived of .its usual force of
teamsters in consequence of the disturbed
relations existing between the Brother
hood of Teamsters a/id the Draymen's
Association. .
The Federated Steamship Painters,
which organization does not belong to the"
Water Front Federation, had a .contro
versy with, the Marine Painters' Union.
The former does the finishing work on the
interiov of the- cabins while- the other
union does the' outside work. The mem
bers of the Marine Painters', Union 1 re
fused to work with the Federated Steam
ship Painters and began a strike. After
: being out for several hours, the Marine
Painters' Union made overtures to the
Federated Steamship Painters' Union for
an amalgamation. It is v expected that
this will be effected yery shortly. -
An effort was made by some of the
larger business houses to utilize the
smaller express wagons to handle the
freight coming in and going out. but the
wagons were inadequate to the task. At
the Southern Pacific depot at Fourth and
Townsend streets a long line of drays
were drawn up, but the lack of knowledge
of how to ship goods congested the sheds.
The pickets from the Brotherhood 'Â¦â¢Â¦ of
Teamsters. were on hand,' and by deriding
the . efforts of the expressmen succeeded
In practically nullifying'thelr efforts.y..
. Secretary Renner of the Draymen's As

The American ship Emily F. Whitney,
which has been waiting a load of freight
at Oakland, could not be. loaded. The ves
sel was put on the drydock to make
some needed repairs pending a settlement
of the difficulty. At the Pacific Mail
dock and at the Oceanic Steamship dock
nothing was doing for the reason that
there were no steamers either to load, or
to discharge. Several are expected in
within the next forty-eight hours, and it
is anticipated that there will be more or
less trouble when they arrive.
Considerable difficulty was experienced
along the water front in the loading and
unloading of various vessels. The Brit

assistance of a few sympathizers and
succeeded in loading his wagon.

as soon as they please. When the people
of San realize the injustice of
their claims they will rise in their might
and stop all this foolishness. It Is non
sense for any man, ! or set of men, to at
tempt to dictate to their employers how
this or that business may be conducted.
We might as well fight the issue, to a
finish first as last. We are in the fight to
stay and propose to teach the laborers a
lesson. A few days of this *kind of busi

and the end will soon come. The "people
are getting tired of these 'Eastern-Induced
strikes . and as it Â¦ strikes the pockets of
every man, woman and child In the com

determined stand that can be made
against these, aggressions' is the only one
that will finally win out. That business
should be. tied up in -this manner at tho
present Um,e is a disgrace to the intelli

instigation of the strike was trivial. Busi

\ STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 22.-
President David Starr Jordan, who left
' San Francisco for the Hawaiian Islands
immediately after the university com
Â¦ mencement in May, returned home to-day.
Dr. Jordan went out as scientific head of
an expedition for the United States Fish
'. Commission. His colleague in the work
and Its business head was Dr. Everman of
the Smithsonian Institution. Besides these
two there were In the party John N. Cobb,
statistician; Mr. Goldborough; George
Shindo, a .Stanford University student,
and two artists. Dr. Everman became ill
from drinking undistllled water shortly
after reaching: the Islands and returned
to the United States, leaving Dr. Jordan
in full charge. Dr. Everman is now elow
ly recuperating at the' home of Dr. Jor
dan on the campus.
The expedition was sent out by the Gov
ernment under a provision of the annex
ation act which required, among other
things; that fishes and fisheries of the isl
ands should be Investigated and reported
upon, as a basis for Congressional legis
lation. The work has been both historical
and scientific A complete copy of all the
laws that had been passed before annex
ation was made under the direction of Mr.
Cobb and will serve as the base of his re
port.
Queer Fishery Laws.
These laws show that conditions have
existed, and still exist, that are foreign to
American laws. For example, individuals
hold as private property the bed of the
ocean for as much as a mile from the
shore. Such owners have the right to
"taboo" certain species of fish or to forbid
all fishing; within their grants. The effect
of "tabooing" Is that all persons who take
|the "tabooed" fish must give them up to
the owner of the water in which they are
Â¦ taken.
The "tabooing" of fish was one of the
royal prerogatives during the monarchy.
Frequently, in times of royalty, arms of
the bays were fenced oft from the ocean
by forced labor, and granted as fish pre
serves to private persons who were often
Americans. These various water rights,
which have survived the passing of the
monarchy and the annexation, will fur
nish themes for the consideration of
Congress.
The purely scientific work of the expe
dition has proved very important. Up to
the time of Dr. Jordan's departure 240
species had been taken. Of these fifty
â¢ were new. If nothing more had been
done than simply to secure these speci
mens the summer's work would have
been a success.
Expert Fishermen Needed.
The fish question is of great import
ance to the islands because of the de
pendence of all classes, but more par
ticularly the natives, upon fish for
food. Deep sea fishing Is little
carried on, because of lack of crews. The
natives are not good for the purpose,
and no others are to be had. Dr. Jor
dan's suggestion to obviate this difficulty
is that expert fishermen from San Fran
cisco be induced to go to Honolulu.
The supply of fish that can. be taken
near the shore Is being depleted by the
steady drain upon it. Especial recom
mendation will be made to Congress by
Dr. Jordan on this subject.
The main provisions of the legislation
to be suggested will be â First, that
fishing: in some waters be en
rtirely prohibited for a time; sec
ond, that there be a closed season dur
ing the time for spawning; and third, that
fishing with nets of less than a three
inch mesh be forbidden. The greatest
needs of the islands, industrially, is la
bor. The Chinese are shut out by the
exclusion act of the United States. Jap
anese, laborers are prevented coining by
home legislation that forbids them to emi
grate. More than 1000 Porto Ricans have
been imported, but their value as laborers
is still undetermined. Most of them, have
been 111 on first arriving, though on re
covering they seem to have proved fair
workers. The United States cannot be
depended upon for the labor supply,
since Americans are usually able to find
more profitable employment.
Politics on. the Islands.
The future of the islands politically is
uncertain. Dr. Jordan believes the Terri
torial form of government will be the
best possible. The present Legislature is
composed principally of natives, with a
few Americans and one Russian. The
legislative efficiency of the people will
continually improve with experience. It
Is Dr. Jordan's opinion that the evil of
corruption in the Legislature is little to
be feared, as mercenary considerations
do not strongly influence the native Ha
waiians. He believes, however, that it
probably would have been the wisest to
have imposed a property qualification for
voting. At present both the Chinese and
the Japanese, who compose the chief in
dustrial strength of the islands, are ex
cluded, and the qualification for others is
the ability to read and write the English
or the American language.

p^Tf*^ HE Epworth League convention,
I which closed Its labors yesterday,

the country who registered at
headquarters are gradually departing,
and ere tho close of the week the pres

a badge wi[l have become a novelty.
Nevertheless, the committee head
quarters at the Pavilion were very lively
yesterday. After to-day the committee
will take up its old station in the Young
Men's Christian Association building,
where the final business of the conven
tion committees will be completed.
â¢ Thousands of people thronged the Pa
vilion yesterday and last night. The va
rious county and private exhibits were a
source of, interest to all beholders. These
exhibjts may be inspected to-day for the
last time, as the building will be vacated
to-night. . .
The quarters of the registration, enter
tainment and reception committees will
be open to-day. Chairman ,W. H.
of the reception committee has dispensed
with the further service 'of his army of
aids Mr. Waste has been untiring in his
efforts to satiify the delegates in every,
possible manner, and his services were
highly appreciated. Yesterday afternoon,
at an Informal gathering, a number of
delegates from the East and from points
in the interior of the State voted him
thanks for his labors in their behalf.
There were some addresses, and the af
fair, proved to be a most pleasant one for
all concerned.

kinsly laurels are conceded to Adolph
Philo Jacoby, the veteran sharpshooter,
scored three consecutive bullseyes on the
Germanja target yesterday and secured
a place (n the front rank of marksmen
on that target.
SCHUE2ZEN KING WILL
The party of excursionists consists of
ninetyÂ»three members of the Independent
Kew York . Schuetzen Club, the New
York Central Schuetzen Club, the Hobo
ken Schuetzen Club and the Hoboken In
dependent Schuetzen Club.
N. Ahrens made ?3. two centers and one
23 shot, on the rins target yesterday
mornlrtff. Dr. Lee O. Rodgers of this
city and. F. W." Belknap of . Los Angeles
lead Ahrens' score- by Just one point on
the same target. Secretary L. Haake had
his first opportunity to do a little shoot
ing: yesterday and --started hl3 score on
the king target with a red flag and within
two boars from the time he commenced
he had won a silver and a gold medal and
scored $4 on the honorary target.
Captain Webber, who acted as spokes
man for the party of Eastern sharpshoot
ers, vrhlch accompanied him, said yes
terdav: "I have visited all the beautiful
spots* in the old country and I say in all
truth that there is nothing across the
vater that can compare with the beauties
of this State." The TCew York party vis
ited JjOS Angeles,. Pasadena, Redlands
and Monterey on the trip and will return
home via Seattle and Portland, thus view
ing the southern, northern and middle
portions of the State. They will go to
Buffalo from Portland,
Kuhls then ran to the window and en
deavored to catch sight of the would-be
robber, but failed to see him. No further
attempt was made to secure the medals,
as a strict watch was held during the
ni^ht.
The "Gay New Yorkers" were present
at the festival yesterday for the second
time since itÂ» commencement. They at
tended the opening: of the shooting bund,
end since the first day have been touring
the State in their special train.
While the fire which raged about tbo
Gaben Temple Sunday night was being
fought by the marksmen an attempt was
made to enter the cottage which is occu
pied by President Kuhlu and Shooting
Masters Huber and Schuster. But for the
activity of the president of the bund the
vests upon which were pinned fully $3000
â¢worth of gold and silver medals would
have been Ftolen.
The attempt at robbery was made at a
time when there was no one in the cottage
but President Kuhls. His presence In the
house at the time was due to a warning
given *iim by one of the special police
men on duty who found the golden bear,
the moFt prized trophy in the possession
of the California Schuetzen Club, outside
the fence surrounding the grounds. He
Mippected that thieves were planning a
raid, and Informed those who occupied the
residence of his suspicion. That it was
Â¦well founded -was proved a few hours
later.
Captain Kuhls, when the fire at the
prize temple was reported to him, deter
mined to remain in the house and guard
its contents. Schuster, Huber, Edward
Ooetze and William Garms rusjied to the
fire and saved the valuable trophies.* The
rescuers were severely burned about
the hands and arms, but succeeded in
saving the thousands of dollars' worth of
Filverware on exhibition in the temple'.
The bundes president, who was in the
front room of the cottage while the blaze
Â¦was in progress at the temple, heard a -sus
picious noise in the adjoining room and on
rushing in found that his vest, which con
tained medals valued at $1000. was, through
some unseen agency, being pulled toward
the window of the room. He grabbed the
valuable piece of wearing apparel and
E reverted the thief from profiting by his
oldness.

MANILA, July 22.â The conference be
tween Adjutant General Corbin and Gen
eral Chaffee, recently held here, will pro
bably result in radical economical and ad
ministrative reforms in the army of oc
cupation. It is estimated that the total
cost of maintaining the American army
in the Philippines can be reduced by sixty
per cent In the course of one year. The
principal change will be the reduction of
the prqsent force to between 20,000 and
30.000. The abolishmeut of the present
army districts If contemplated and three
brigades with permanent headquarters at
Manila, Dagupan and Hollo or Cebu will
be instituted In .their stead. The troops
will bo 'concentrated at three points se
lected,' abandoning all minor posts. The
change will result in an enormous saving
of transportation of supplies and the pay-
Ing of detail .'barracks for the offices. " At
present In' most towns, the troops are
quartered in churches; convents and pub
lic and private buildings, for the use.of
which" considerable rentals are- paid. In
"the majority oÂ£ other cases, where the
troops do not cccupy public buildfngs, it
Is believed rental' should be paid for the
goldiers' quarters if their occupancy is
continued, since these regions are pacl
: fled and -their- Inhabitants have sworn-al
legiance to the United States. - v -'
â¢ Adjutant General Corbin and ' General
Chaffee- have decided upon the construc
tion of barracks at the pumping station,
about six miles from Manila, and the
source of the city's water supplly, to ac
comodate the three regiments of infantry,
one of cavalry and eight batteries of ar
tillery as well as the general commissary
and quartermaster's store house to cost
$100,000. The erection of this latter build
ing will reduce expenses 520.000 a month,
being the rentals paid for the commissary
and quartermaster store houses in Manila
alone. An electric railway, connecting
the docks on the Paslg river and the new
store house will be constructed.
Generals Corbin and Chaffee have also
decided upon one single general military
hospital to replace the seven military hos
pitals in Manila and vicinity; one of the
latter buildings will be converted into a
hospital. The reduction of the great fleet
of government launches and small gov
ernment steamers has already begun.
Permanent barracks have been erected
at Dagupan to accomodate all the troops
necessary to Northern Luzon. Govern
ment vessels will carry supplies for the
Southern brigade from the United ritntes
direct to Ilcilo' without touching at
Manila.
The insular constabulary is now being
organized. It will be maintained by the
Insular government and is expected to be
tmply abl>? to preserve peace and enforce
the law. This constabulary will, as a gen
eral rule, be armed with rifles, but its
members have been given 5000 shotguns
and 2000 ponies relinquished by the army

Suggests Their Disbarment
Clarkson D.yÂ« and O. P. Stidger, law

In the landlna of Chinese, have been rec
ommended lor, disbarment by Labor Com
missioner Po*'derty for having- - made
themselves offanetve to* James R. Dunn,
chief Inspector In charge of the Chinese
Bureau.
A letter from Commissioner Powderly
reached Custom* Inspector Stratton yes
terday, in which letter Powderly says
that Dye and StMger have been guilty
of grossly unprofessional conduct and are
not the kind of people to whom the Col
lector should extend the courtesy of ap
pearing before the Chinese -Bureau for
their clients. The Commissioner, there
fore, authorizes the Collector to withhold
from Messrs. Dye and Stidger the privi
leges usuallv granted attorneys in . the
Chinese Bureau, should the Collector be
lieve that such a course would be for the
best interests of the bureau. As soon as
Chief Dunn had been served with an offi
cial copy of the letter he wrote a letter
to Collector Stratton urging the disbar
ment of the attorneys named, so far as
the Chinese Bureau Is concerned, as a
measure of protection to the bureau in its
efforts to prevent the landing in this State
of coolie laborers. - .
Chief Dunn made an oral statement
yesterday of the incidents that culminated
in calling down Commissioner Powderly's
thunderbolts upon the heads of the unfor
tunate attorneys. F"r*m that statement
it appears that Mr. Dye was attorney for
a Chinese laborer who wished to pay a
visit to China and return. In order to
comply with the law this Chinaman made
affidavit that he had credits in this State
covered by promissory notes. Upon this
affidavit Chief Dunn refused to issue a
return certificate, his interpretation of
the exclusion act beinff that the debts
claimed to be owing: to the emigrant
should not -be ascertained or settled debts
or covered by promissory notes or other
colorable evidence of debt.
From this refusal to Issue the certifi
cate Dye took an appeal. Dunn says. He
alleged that the promissory notes had
been destroyed after Chief Dunn had ta
ken action on his client's application, and
in his behalf he said the promissory notes
never existed. He accused Chief Dunn of
bias and prejudice against the Chinese
and of ignorance regarding the business
methods of the Chinese. Chief Dunn took
Mr. Dye to task for the allegations in
the brief reflecting upon the Chiefs mo
tives, and told Mr. Dye what he thought
of htm. . â¢ Â¦ . â¢ Â¦ .

COLUMBIA LOSES
TO CONSTITUTION
Rare Skill and Judgment
Mark Handling of Both
Vessels.
Smooth Water and Steady Wind.
NEW YORK, July 22.â The race between
the Constitution and the Columbia on
Long Island Sound to-day again demon
strated that the Constitution Is the faster
fair-weather craft In a light breeze and
smooth water, over a twenty-one-mile
course, the Columbia was defeated four
minutes eighteen seconds, elapsed time.
The cruise of the New York Yacht Club
opened brilliantly to-day with â¢ the race
for three valuable cups presented by
Commodore Ledyard. After the rendez
vous at Glencove the ; squadron got un
der way and steered for the starting line
off Matiniconk Point buoy, where the
steam yacht Revere with the regatta com
mittee aboard let go her anchor. The
whole fleet was eligible to compete and
was divided into three classes, schooners,
single masted vessels and yawls In cruis
ing trim, and the two cup defenders, Con
stitution and Columbia, in racing trim.
Naturally the principal interest was
focused on these two splendid racers,
which came to the encounter in thorough
ly fit condition. Starting in a, nice sailing
breeze, which, however, at no time ex
ceeded a seven-knot strength, the Con
stitution beat her rival, the Columbia,
smartly handled and sailed with rare skill
and judgment, four minutes and eighteen
seconds over a twenty-one-mile course.
The first leg was eleven miles northeast
by east, one-half east, dead before the
wind, the -second leg being a beat to wind
ward of five miles, west southwest, one
half west, and the third leg a stretch with
the wind forward of the starboard beam
to finish line, one mile west from Eaton's
Point light.
The water was smooth and the wind
fairly steady from start to finish. The
Constitution started absolutely last of all
the competitors. She overhauled the hind
most very rapidly and several minutes
before the outer mark was reached she
held a proud position in the van, beating
the Columbia four minutes and seven sec
onds. Luffing beautifully round the mark
she buckled down to a pretty thresh to
windward, and in this%hort leg she gained
flfty-slx seconds on her rival. In the last
leg she gained six seconds and romped
past the stakeboat a winner of the cup.
The extension of the bowsprit of the
Constitution will necessitate a remeasure
ment of the yacht for time allowance.
Roughly estimated, the Constitution
should allow the Columbia fifty-one
seconds over a twenty-one mile course,
so, on corrected time, the Constitution is
a winner by three minutes twenty-seven
seconds. It should be also borne In mln.l
that in the run before the wind the
Columbia was favored with a freshening
breeze, which helped her to materially
lessen the gap. once nearly a mile wide,
which separated her from her antagonist.
Had It not been for this the victory of the
Constitution would have been far more
decisive and convincing.
Former Cup Defenders Start.
A pleasing: incident in the contest was
the appearance of the celebrated old
schooner America, which more than half
a century ago won the historic cup for
which Shamrock II will- race this year.
Another former cup ; defender, the
schooner Columbia, which sailed several
successful races against 1 Ashbury's
schooners Cambria and . Livonia when
they came here in .1870 and 1S71, al.sd
started.
- The times at the start were as follows:
Constitution, 2:46:35. Columbia. 2:45:58.
The finishâ Constitution, 5:13:50. Colum

m The joint installation of Pacific and
Golden West's officers last Thursday night
was a- very impressive ceremony which
was witnessed by a large number of the
members of the order.
The allied bosses base their hopes of
success on a light vote at the primary
election. They concede that the Republi
can ' Primary League will win if a heavy
vote is cast on August 13. The large at
tendance of voters at league headquar
ters, Baldwin Annex, 930 Market street,
plainly signifies that "popular interest in
the approaching contest is on the in
crease. Last, night the league rooms
were crowded with representative men
from the various districts and the most
cheering accounts were given of district'
enrollment and enthusiasm. The at
tendance at the league rooms Is fivefold
greater than that exhibited by rival.as
sociations. Early in the campaign' sev
eral hundred enrollment books', each con
taining blanks and stubs for, twenty-five
names, were sent out. One hundred
books completely, filled out have been re
turned. Many other books will be filled
out and returned before the present. week
ends. Â¦ *Â¦ Â¦ ''Â¦
Â¦ The Important duty of citizens now re-,
lates to registration. On August 3 the
registration for the primary election will,
close.' The Registrar estimates that the
number of unregistered voters Â¦ approxi
mates 5000. Steps should be taken to se
cure the registration- of every .citizen
who is entitled to vote. . Â¦ ; â¢ â¢ ' .,
Property owners in e.very district should
urge their neighbors to register. Efficient,
progressive' and economical local govern
ment can be obtained if citizens will come
forward and perform | a duty to them
selves and the public. Failure to vote Is
a half vote for the bosses and taxlooters.
There is nothing vague or misty in con
nection with the contest now impending.
The bosses have lined up under the lead
ership of Gage. Kelly, Crimmins, Herrln
and Burns to force a government of cor
rupt bosslsm on the city. Martin Kelly
is the recognized archboss of the gang.
He has a little water front patronage at
his disposal, but twenty promises of em
ployment in the Stat.e service will be
given for every position at his command.
It is the general verdict of well informed
politicians that Governor Gage makes the
mistake of his life in interfering in the
municipal affairs of San Francisco. The
interference lets him out of the race for
the next Governorship of California.
Since the State Central Committee de
based Itself by recognizing the Kelly
County Committee the membership of the
Republican Primary League has increased
In a marked degree. On the other hand no
new life has been infused into the Martin
Kellv committee. The boss headquarters
Is deserted. KeputaMe citizens will not
go to tho committee rooms; candidates

At the rooms of the Republican Primary
The Board of Election â¢ Commissioners
adopted a** resolution yesterday granting
the Republican party a designation and
place on the official ballot to be used at
the primary election ! on August 13,, 1901.
In taking this action the board recognized
the petition filed by Augustus Tilden,
chairman, and A. B. Mahony, secretary,
but in doing so stated that the resolution
did not in any sense carry with it -thÂ«
right to place the names of any particu
lar set of delegates on the ballot. "Jake
Steppacher presented' the resolution or tno
State Central Committee, deciding in
favor of the Tilden County Committee,
which had been prepared last Saturday
"after hearing argument on the case.
Commissioner Kellogg -then Introduced
the resolution on the subject as follows:
After the resolution was adopted, Attor
ney Ruef asked If the recognition of the
Tilden committee would result in the
printing of the names of Its delegates on
the official ballot. Ruef explained that
many people. were of the opinion that
such would be the result.
Commissioner Kellogg assured Ruef that
the decision 'simply covered the apportion
ment asked for by the Tilden committee
and that no names would be printed on
the ballots. This wlU give citizens the
right to vote for whatever delegates they
may choose ! '
cides Important Question of In

League enthusiasm and activity prevail.
Every day adds to the strength and pres
tige of the. league. Last night at a meet
ing: of club presidents and secretaries
every district but the Forty-first was rep
resented. By common consent . the antl
boss fight in the Forty-first is assigned to
the Central Republican Club, of which
Horace Davis is president. Prom other
districts the league received the most
gratifying reports: Delegate tickets were
discussed Informally, the sentiment being
expressed that citizens of the highest
character should be placed on the tickets.

The Sierra brings the news of a bad ac
cident to the schooner Defender. She ar
rived at Hanamaula from San Francisco
en July 9 and six days later, during a
blow, her anchors dragged and she went
on the rocks. After some trouble she was
got off and inspected. She was not leak
ing, but part of Xhe shoe was gone and
the rudder and rudder post damaged.
She will be fixed up and sent to this port
for an overhauling.
The C. D. Bryant, which caught fire at
the wharf and was flooded, has since been
pumped out and when the Sierra sailed
her cargo was being sold at public auction
es Quickly as it could be taken out of the
hold. It is not thought that the huli is
much damafied.
When the bark St. James, before report
ed as partially dismasted, reached Hono
lulu it was found that her cargo of coal
was heated. Had she been out much
longer the crew might have had a fight
Â¦with fire as well as with the storm king
on their hands.

v The San Francisco Call says that Sena-/
tor E. K. Taylor of Alameda County, anV
attorney, is one of the two lawyers who
are sending circulars. to saloon-keepers In
the various- municipalities of the State,
soliciting agreements to pay a certain fee
in case a decision ,be secured from the
Supreme Court that, under a new law
passed by .the late Legislature, Boards of
Supervisors have no power to levy or col
lect a county license tax tor' the sale of
intcxicants within municipalities.
The law in question Is chapter 209 and
was Assembly bill 456, introduced by As
semblyman J. M. Kelley of Alameda.'
The old law gave the Supervisors power
to license for the purpose of regulation
and- revenue, but In the new law revenue
was not inserted. ?
v It is claimed that the change has the
effect of depriving Supervisors of the pow
er to levy a county license within munici
pal limits.
SUPERVISORS CANNOT LEVY.
The Alabama plan, to which attention was directed
some days ago, provides that any officer of the State
who fails to protect a prisoner from a mob shall be
liable to summary removal from office, and heavy
penalties are imposed upon all. who taWe . part in
lynching. The plan submitted 'in Virginia is not so
drastic in dealing with unfaithful officials, but it has
none the less "its "good features. According to the
summary reported in the dispatches the plan provides
that "the Governor .shall offer a reward for the de T
tection and convictionof persons,^ aiding a mob ;i by
which the life of any person is taken; -anyone found
engaged in such mob shall be deemed guilty of mur
der in the . first degree. When murder is not com
mitted, but great bodily injury is inflicted, " persons
aiding the mob shall be deemed guilty of riot. - The
.Governor is authorized to pay a certain sum out of
the State treasury to the heirs of any person mur
dered by '.a mob and to charge the amount .to the
county in which the lynching was perpetrated."
course neither o'f the plans proposed can effect
much unless supported by a resolute, public opinion,
but fortunately there is hope that such a sentiment
will be found. The very consideration given Â¦ to. the
subject by the two conventions is itself an evidence
that the controlling. element of the South has be

upon universal suffrage as to admit illiterate whites to
vote while excluding illiterate negroes." They have
many other problems to deal with, not the least of
which is that of providing some method for putting a
stop to the outrageous crimes committed in the name
of lynch law. In both conventions propositions have
been submitted looking to that end, and it is probable
the results may prove highly beneficial.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
I: In an issue of this kind there should be no delay
oh the part of good men in taking action. Every ear
nest Republican should use his full influence to rouse
his friends to a recognition of- the importance of the
contest. No one should be permitted to forget the
issue or his duty with respect to it. There should
be a thorough registration and a thorough enroll
ment of the rank and file of the Republican party, so
that at the primaries there will be a vote large enough
to defeat the gangs and drive the- bosses out of Re
publican politics.
In times past honest men have had some excuse
for remaining away from the primaries because such
elections were controlled by men who had no hesita
tion in resorting to force or fraud in shaping the re
sults as the bosses desired. It was by his skill in
that kind of work that Kelly rose to the evil dignity
of being an associate of Herrin, and was admitted to
"do politics" with the Governor of the State. Such
tactics, however, cannot be made use of now. The
primary law protects every citizen in his right to vote
and to have his vote counted. Consequently no valid
excuse remains for staying away from the primaries.
The Republican who negkets the election this year
will voluntarily surrender his franchise in. the interest
- of the bosses.
It is even at this time perceived that a large vote
at the Republican primaries will mean the success of
the better elements of the party, for not even with the
aid of the Democratic push can the bosses bring to
the polls a sufficient numher of men to outvote the
better element if that element be fully represented.
Everything, then, depends upon good citizens them
selves. They have now an opportunity to rid their
party and their city of the domination of corrupt
gangs, and if they fail the fault will be their own.
Such an issue appeals to the civic patriotism as well
as to the party loyalty of men, and.it is to be hoped
there will be few gepuine Republicans in San Fran
cisco who will be indifferent to it.
maries. The activity of the bosses should be met by
an equal activity on the part of good citizens.
Such a combination cannot be defeated without
earnest work on the part of the better elements of
the party. Neglect of political duty or indifference to
it on the part of any considerable number of working
men, business men and professional men will result
in a i-ictory for the corrupt elements of the city. It
is therefore important that all who are physically able
should give some portion of their time and their
energies to making preparations for the coming pri-
REGISTER AND ENROLL.
SAN FRANCISCO Republicans in their efforts
to nominate good men' for office and provide
the city with an efficient administration find
themselves confronted by the bosses. The issue is
made plain and emphatic. To the aid of the bosses
there has been openly summoned all the following
controlled by Federal or State patronage, and se
cretly the following of the bosses in the Democratic
camp will also give aid. It is a sure thing that on
election day the Kelly and Herrin gang will carry
to the Republican primaries numbers of men who are
not in any sense members of the Republican party.
Their object is to win and to force the nomination
of a boss ticket They are absolutely unscrupulous
as to the means employed to attain that end.

PERSONAL MENTibN:
. Last Saturday Conness received a tele
gram to, come to Vallejo a,nd get his new
horse. He declares emphatically thatjhe
only took one drink on tho way to Vallejo
and that he did not see "double" when
the horse waa brought out for inspection.
What he. did see was a sorrel gelding
measuring 82 inches in height at the
withers and whose head "is almost ten
feet from the ground. A man six feet
one inch in height standing beside the
animal yesterday could not look over his
"Well, money is no object," replied,
Conness, and forthwith the friend was
commissioned, to buy the animal and was
given a sack of twenty dollar gold pieces
with which to clinch the bargain.

II in San Francisco and Its owner,
rr. D. Conness, electrical engineer of
the Risdon. Iron Works, is likely
to create a . sensation . when he
drives the giant equine along Market
street. - - . .
Conness has a fad for large horses, as
the nature of his business requires that
he have a driving animal that can stand
considerable work. A few days ago Con
ness complained to a, friend that he could
not get a horse large enough.. His friend
told him that he could furnish him with
an animal that would meet all require
ments.
â¢ "I know where there is a horse that will
suit you," said his friend.
"Samson," as the beast is called, tip
ped the scales yesterday at a trifle over
one ton. A tape measure placed along
the front of his head measured two feet
IO76 inches from tip of his nose to a
point between the ears. Around the jav/s,
four feet of tape were required to get
the girth. At the hocks the animal
measured 1 fooc 6 inches. The length of
"Samson" from his* nose to' the stump
of his fail, is 10% feet. Around the body
it required . nine feet of tape to take the
measurement of the animal, and he is
said to be capable of taking on 500 pounds
more, as he is not in the pink of condl-
back, and was topped by a foot $t horse
flesh when .standing beside the
'shoulders.
An offer for the horse was received by
his owner yesterday from Sells' circus, the
proprietors having â¢ been in negotiation
with the man who disposed of Samson
Saturday to his present owner.
Conness declared yesterday that he
would have a buggy specially built for
Samson and use him in his business
around the city "Whether he will try his
giant animal on the speed track at the
park Is not yet known.

trouble to bring "Samson" to this
city. He was placed on the blgr fiver boat.
General Frlsble last Saturday evening
and some woodwork had to be broken
away in order to allow him to stand up
right. At Mission street wharf Samson
could not be landed. 'The hatch In the
side of the river boat Is as large as those

tried to step up the Incline to the dock,
his shoulders stuck in tha casing. A land
ing was finally made at Jackson street
wharf, as there is a small float there at
the foot of an Incline. Samson was able
to walk out of the hatch on the level
float and then climbed the sloping gang
way to the wharf.
Samson was raised on a farm owned
by a man named Bullard four miles from
Woodland. His tire and- dam were ordin

As we have frequently shown from official docu
ments, the freight and passenger rates of the United
States are far .below and the wages of the employes
far above those of Europe. .So here we have still no
solution of the problem that vindicates public owner
ship. .The Continental Governments, which consist
of armed camps, desire absolute control of their rail
way systems for military purposes, offensive and de
fensive^and that. is probably the underlying motiv-e of
their acquisition. England .and the United States
have no such state necessity, which may account in
part for. their abstention from such ownership. ' The
public, the users of the Continental Government rail
ways, are of secondary importance, either as shippers,
travelers or taxpayers. If the accounting were made
as in private business, it is entirely probable that the
same fact will: be found concealed behind the books
of Alameda and of 'the Continental Governments, that
government waste in administering business' is equal
to corporate profit. . .
Those who ignore these elements 'in the problem
fix their gaze upo'n" public ownership of the largest
public utiHties in Europe.' But those applications of
the policy are under . governments widely, different in
form .to ours, and to' .which purs.cannot.be approxi
mated; except by/changes so fundamental as to de
stroy its identity. But there is no evidence that even
those government's "succeed any better than pur 'cities
in public ownership. One of our Gonsuls, Mr. Guen
ther, reports that so rapid. has. been the absorption
of steam railways by Continental Governments that
England and the United States are the only private
railroad countries left in the world. But he adds that
those who" have traveled on American railways and
the government roads of the Continent prefer our
roads for comfort, cheapness and all those things
which make the use of railways desirable. :
The electric flight plant seems not to be kept, up,
but the rate of depreciation.- is unknown, as in other
items, all important to be known. In* all respects of
legitimate government Alameda" is really a model
town. Its administration of the proper police powers
of government-has been creditably free from pecula
tion and scandal. There is no suspicion that there
is any dishonesty in running its electric light plant.
What happens in that respect occurs in the nature of
vthings. Alameda, like other municipalities, ,js not
qualified to carry on business that is not functional to
government. .- . . .
The Enquirer marvels that this is so, and very prop
erly declares that it ought not to be so, but it is.
The smallest corporation in Alameda would be forced
into court, by its smallest stockholder if such condi
tions appeared in 1 the accounts* kept by order of its
directors. But Alameda itself is the greatest corpora
tion on that charming'peninsula^and its largest stock
holder, who ir its; largest taxpayer, can get no satis
faction; from his trustees and none from the courts.
It is found impossible from the public accounts 'to
tell whether public ownership of an electric light
plant by Alameda is a paying or a losing venture.
One party says it pays, another that it loses; both
complain of the^kind of service and each resorts to
the public accounts to prove its position, to find them
so kept that neither can prove 'anything.
THE "Oakland Enquirer, .which has sometimes
somewhat misunderstood The Call's position on
public ownership of public utilities, takes ! no
tice of a nearbyi illustration of that policy which points
the moral we have drawn from in Chicago,
Itfew York and other cities' where disinterested in
quiry has exposed the concealment in accounts'of the
fact that municipal waste equals or exceeds corporate
profit. Â¦ < ' . 'Â¦ ' i

CONNESS LONGS FOR A LARGE HORSE
AND A KIND FRIEND FINDS HIM ONE
Samson, a Mammoth, Equine/Seven Feet High and Weighing a Ton* Is
Brought Over From Vallejo and Will Startle San Franciscans When He
' ; Appears on the Streets of the City Attached to an Ordinary Buggy
An /examination of the two Â¦ cases as they stand
seems to demonstrate that for a brutal;father to kill
his daughter is only manslaughter, and that he' has
the right to kill any one who interferes to prevent
him killing his- daughter, incurring thereby also only
the penalty for manslaughter. t '
What are the Berkeley people to do? Shall they
lay awake nights while men murder children to whom
by law and nature- they owe the tenderest protection,
or shall they try and stop it and be shot for their
pains because they have Entered a. castle that for the
time being is used as a shambles? We are unable to
decide the point. Perhaps the middle ground would
be found in taking, a pot shot at the abusive and bru
tal.father, just to stop the abuse and see what a jury
wouH do about it. Â¦ . '
One evening the daughter of Mr. Adams claimed
protection of the neighbors, and one of them, Dr.
Jessup, entered the Adams house for defensive pur
poses and was immediately shot down by Mr. Adams.
The latter upon arraignment before a Berkeley magis
trate was held in light bail for manslaughter, his law
yer contending that a man's house, is his castle, and
no one may enter there except upon invitation. ,Now
what are the Berkeley people to do? At least what
will those do who are neighbors of men who abuse
their daughters and occasionally do them to death?.
The Â¦ neighbors of Brandes respected his castle, and
shivered in the street when they heard the thick
blows and the thin cries for mercy of the daughter he
was murdering, or, according to .the -jury, merely
manslaughtjering. They were blamed, by more dis
tant neighbors and the public for not interfering to
save the child. Perhaps stung by this, Dr. Jessup
did interfere in the case of Brandes' partner in the
amusement of abusing children, and was promptly
killed by the father.
In Berkeley is another citizen, Mr. Adams. He is
an unfrocked clergyman, who clinked the cannikin
until his presence in the pulpit was incompatible with
the ideas of that holy office entertained by worship
ing congregations. Thereafter he followed Bacchus
so closely that that patron "saint of the bibulous and
hilarious felt his heels in danger. He varied heavy
drinking by abuse of his daughter. Here we pause to
remark that as his case is before the cour^ we will
pursue the matter as personal to Mr. Adams no fur
ther, but take it up in its relation to the neighbors
and the perturbed people of Berkeley.
One morning the hapless child was found dead in
the basement, many places on- her body being re
duced to a purple pulp by the muscular discipline
heard by the passers-by and the neighbors next door
and ac/oss the street The child's cadaver bore fresh
marks of violence sufficient to cause her death, and
the testimony was duly excised and confined in alco
hol for use at the trial of her father for her mur
der. The evidence of her anatomy, added to the tes
timony of - the non-interfering neighbors, procured
her father's conviction of murder.
The justice of the verdict impressed all except the
culprit and his able attorneys, who found enough
t's not crossed and i's not dotted in .the courtVin
structions to secure anew trial. But time had lapsed.
Sun and storm and seasons finally choke the voice
of that spilled blood which is said to cry out from the
ground for vengeance. Alcohol is no kinder than
its chemical partners, and various exhibits of the frail
body used in evidence on the second trial spoke with
less certainty. Maybe the neighbors, too, had grown
less, certain of the horror with which they used to
stand outside, the Brandes gate and hear, the little
girl beaten and begging for mercy. Anyway," the sec
ond jury had enough members inclined to indifference
to force the verdict down to a mild variety of man
slaughter, and Mr. Brandes is taking the ajr at Fol
som penitentiary for a few years in expiation of a
crime which if he committed it at all was murder of
the foulest and most unnatural kind.' If he slew that

Berkeley sh6uld be a somewhat perturbed
_ community. Indeed .the state of being per
turbed may in modified form "affect all .'Alameda

quired a taste for. beating a physically infirm daugh
ter. She was a poor, hectic creature, perhaps . af
flicted with pernicious anemia. But she was hollow,
and her parent.- made the neighbors acquainted with
the gamut of misery as they listened to the.resound

to her emaciated exterior.
EVERY MAN'S CASTLE.
The plans proposed in Alabama and Virginia may
of course be modified before adoption, so it is possible
that, even better remedial measures may be provided
than those now submitted.: But of the\ changes in
their constitutions, therefore, the two States may
gain something better than restricted suffrage, and
the illiterate negro deprived of his vote mayvat least
obtain a surer protection for his life and person
against the. assaults of mobs.
i In addition to the evidence of a change; in public
sentiment in the South, which is afforded by the
efforts of the, two conventions to suppress the prac
tice, there exists another in the diminished number of
lynchings. The Chicago Tribune, which for a long
series of years has carefully kept a record of all of
fenses of the kind, recently pointed out that while in
1892 there were- 235 Â¦ lynchings in the United States
up to November 13, thelynching record for the entire
year of 1900 numbered but 101. .The record as it
stands is bad enough to constitute a national dis
grace, but in comparison to what it was in 1892 there
is evident a gratifying diminution in the frequency of
the outrages. ' ' , -
communitie? by the 'toleration of such barbaric out
breaks as have too frequently happened. /Thus,
should the proposed provisions, against lynching be
put into the constitutions, there would be a fair ex
pectation of their enforcement. ' . '

Serious Blunder in the Office
' of the District At
torney.
Samuel Spry, who was arrested last
week on a dispatch from the Sheriff at
Salt Lake City, stating that he was want
ed there on" a charge of felony embezzle
ment, Is fighting his extradition. He has
secured the services of Attorney George
Monteith, and Attorney Brayley from
Salt Lake City is here to assist.
Yesterday afternoon his application for
a writ of habeas corpus was heard be
fore Judge Cook. It was argued for Spry
that the warrant for his arrest, prepared
in the District Attorney's office here and
signed by Judge Conlan, merely charged
him, with the crime of "being a fugitive
from justice from the State of Utah,"
which was no crime, and therefore he was
beine illegally deprived of his liberty.
Monteith referred to the case of Culbreth,
decided by the Supreme Court in. 1875.
The Judge said the point was well ta
ken. - The case was precisely similar to
the Culbreth case, where it was held that
the warrant was radically defective, inas
much as it did not allege that any crime
had been committed, but simply alleged
that . Culbreth was a fugitive from jus
tice. That had been the law since 1875,
and. he could not understand * why the
proper process-, which was very simple,
had upt been followed. He did not be
lieve in arresting a man merely on a dis
patch from 'another State. â¢
Assistant District Attorney Deuprey
asked for a continuance till this morningi
but the Judge said he had no power to
grant it and issued the writ ordering the
prisoner discharged. â¢ '
Attorney Brayley asked for an order
for the return of the $420 found on. Spry
when arrested, but the Judge said he had
nothing to do with that. The two attor
neys and Spry went to the office of the.
Chief of Police to get the order and were
shadowed by Sergeant Shaw, who had
arrested Spry. They were . shown into
Captain Seymour's office, the Chief being
there.
Meantime a proper complaint and war
rant will be prepared and served . upon
Spry, and besides a deputy Sheriff is ex
pected this morning from Salt Lake City
with the papers for Spry's extradition.
Spry was superintendent of the street
sprinkling department in Salt Lake City
and is charged with the embezzlement of
$755.

"Now from Hawaii to Maui the distance
by water is thirty miles, so that the
demonstration is complete -of the prac
ticability of the use of the system for all
purposes between the Farallon Islands
and San Francisco, for the expanse of
water to be crossed is the same in both
instances. That fact alone is sufficient
to determine that the system would be a
success for San Francisco. Perhaps the
readers of The Call would like to have'
some facts about the actual use of the
Marconi invention, as I saw it in the
Hawaiian group. ; .
"My attention was first forcibly at
tracted to the matter on the second day
that I was in Hilo. On a bulletin board
was the announcement of the decision of
the Supreme Court of the United States
In the insular cases. The message had
been received from Honolulu by the wire
less system of telegraphy. Several Ha
waiians asked me what the United States
would doâ whether they would be fairly
treated. The incident led me to ask about
Marconi's system there: There is no
money with which to provide cables and
well as the humorous specialties of Mur
ray & Appell and Greiviller and Graham
are each well received. Baby Ruth. J. J.
Mackey and Mr. HInrichs' well-trained
orchestra are all popular..
egraphy among the islands of
Hawaii has , convinced him that it Is the
duty of Congress to provide the system
for use between the Farallone Islands and
San Francisco as soon as possible, as the
system Is a practical success.
"I have just come up from the Hawaiian
Islands," said Congressman Stark yester
day at the Hotel St. Denis. VI went down
there for the sake of my wife's health. I
carefully investigated- the Marconi sys
tem in its actual, daily use. It has proved
so much of a success among the islands
that the people rely upon it just as much
as they would upon a cable. Neither fog.
wind nor rain interferes with the sending
and receipt of messages. At every hotel
you will find the blanks of the Intei-
Island Telegraph Company in a rack, just
as you "see blanks of the Western Union
telegraph in all public places here. News
of importance is continually being trans
mitted from one island to another. If you
are not on the coast or are distant from
the stations of the wireless telegraph, you
can Btart via the telephone the message
that you wish to send. It will be trans
mitted from shore to shore and repeated
by telephone and wireless telegraphy
from island to island until it arrives at
its destination.
Example for This Port. *
CONGRESSMAN TV. L. STARK of
Nebraska says that careful in
vestigation of the operation of
Marconi's system of wireless tel-

pic Club and of the Masonic fraternity,

on Thursday afternoon.
Frank Arata was a man of wide charity
to more than his own people. His hand
was always extended to aid the lowly
and his purse was always open for the
doing of good. He is survived by a widow
and one daughter, the wife of Charles F.
Grondona of the A. Galli Fruit Company.
"I came up on the sailing bark Santiago
with Mrs. Stark. Early one morning Cap
tain Engels, a splendid mariner, by the
way, waked me to say that we were near
the Farallon Islands. We were surround
ed by the fog and on the ebb of the tide.
We could not see the Farallones then and
the islands did not heave into sight for
three-quarters of ah hour. Then they
were four or five miles off and not Just
where we expected to find them. We
could see the islands very well, but there
was an area, of fog all around them. Had
there been a wireless telegraph station
/at the Farallones we could have communi
cated with the shore. The Santiago Is one
of the sugar fleet. If there were four ves
sels to #o in at the same time and there
was an advantage of getting to the dock â¢
first our ydrrival could have been an- 1
nounced when we sighted the Farailones
and .we would have .been able to have
spoken for dock room then. That is an
important consideration with a vessel.
"Suppose the Rio had sighted the Faral
lones when she was off the coasV just be
fore she went to wreck. She would have
asked for instructions and would have
been saved, in all probability. 1 Put me
down as an earnest advocate of wireless
telegraphy for use between .the Farallonea
and San Francisco."
Farallones in a Fog.
"Some experimenting was necessary in
the first place to obtain desired results,
but since the first of last June there has
been no trouble about the transmission of
messages with certainty. The poles are
forty to fifty feet high. The messages are
received in the telephone offices. In the
case of the British bark Senator, which
reached Hilo leaking and in distress, the
captain sent a message up to Davis & Co.
at Honolulu. Then Davis & Co. sent a let
ter to San Francisco. From this city a
cablegram was forwarded to London and
a cablegram was sent back to San Fran
cisco. Then the mails had to be resorted
to again. Now that seemed queer that
the only part of the Â¦way where there was
no wire communication was between San
Francisco and Honolulu. That was an ob
ject lesson for Congress and for the Amer
ican people.
"I do not approve of - appropriating
money for anything purely experimental
in many Instances, but where the value of
an invention to commerce has been com
pletely demonstrated there is no excuse
for the Government if it falls to give the
public facilities that are within easy
reach. You see that the baby territory
has already something to teach in this
direction.
Experiments Bring Success.
the conditions are not entirely favorable
for cables. The answer to my questions
was that the people were greatly pleased.

vived last night to a very good audience.
The sparkling little opera seems by no
means to have reached the . limit of Its
popularity and - will doubtless hold the
house well together until the opening of
the grand opera season. It is running
now very smoothly, and Annie Myers,
Hartman, Webb and the other favorites
of the cast were received with much en
thusiasm.
Next week the grand opera season will
begin, with "Aida" and "Rigoletto" as
â¢alternate bills.
Fischer's Concert House.
This week's programme is a festival
one at Fischer's. The dliet from "La

There is a. most attractive and varied
bill at the Orpbeum this week and last
night the audience, which crowded every
part of the house, showed by their en
thusiastic applause ho* much they ap
preciated the efforts, of the performers.
Among the newcomers Ed F. Reynard,
the \ entriloqulal comedian, scored a well
deserved success. He keeps the fun going
from the time be appears till he leaves
the stage. His moving figures, particu
larly the "darky woman," are excellent
Will H. Murphy and Blanche Nicholls
present an amusing and clever sketch,
"The Bifurcated GlrL" and the finale is
sensational. The three Brooklyns are un
questionably eccentric musical wonders,
and they make sweet music out of the
most inconceivable things. Amita, the
spectacular dancer, with her exquisite
scenes, made a hit. The sketch "For
Reform,*' presented by Hugh Stanton and
Florence has a moral for young
wives and husbands. The holdovers are
the Djmni Brothers, acrobats; Charles
Leonard Fletcher, monologist and im
personator; Chevalier Enrico Mario Scog
namillo, cellist, and the American bio
graph with some new scenes.
TivolL
"The Toymaker" at the Tivoli was re-
v "Trilby," with Its loathsome Svengall,
the volatile Zouzou, the recklessly gay
Bohemian company such as Du Maurier
saw in the Parisian atelier, is the success
this week at the Central. Juliet Crosby
as the heroine has added to her bouquets
as a painstaking and finished artist and
v.as rewarded last night with numerous
curtain calls by the delighted audience.
Mr. Bronhy has never appeared to better
advantage in his present engagement than
in the role of the mesmerist musician,
and repulsive as he makes it his skill
and talent as a character actor gain for
him the honors of a curtain repeatedly
raised in response to the vociferous de
mands of a house that insists in bringing
good actors to life, even after they have
ertistically died on the stage. So it was
last night that after Svengali had turned
up his Trilbies on the table in the foyer
of the Paris theater he responded to the
curtain call, by lying across the table
dead as before, which made a great hit

Central.
Alcazar.
TVycherley's old English comedy, "The
Country Girl," crowded the house and
served to display the ability of the Alca
zar Company, of which Florence Rob
erts is the bright particular star, last
la the rolÂ© of Peggy Thrift Miss Rob
oits appears to splendid advantage. The
impersonation of the innocent country
girl, who, however, learns quickly the
deceptions of city life in London, is given
in an artistic manner. The many curtain
calls given the favorite actress last even
ing were well merited. George Webster
as the jealous Squire Moody is somewhat
too boisterous. White Whittlesey made
a gallant Dick Belville and played
throughout In a finished style. Lucius
Henderson made a. hit as the vain cox
comb, Sparkish. Agnes Rankin had but
little to do as Alithea. but >' I that little
very well. Paul Gerson as t J Harcourt
and Marie Howe as Lucy rendered effi
cient support to the principals. The cos
tuming of the play was rich and the set
tings in keeping with the period of the
ccmedy.
A good performance of Steele Maek
aye's favorite old melodrama, "Paul
Kauvar," was jnven last nigrht by the
Frawley Company at the Grand Opera
house. The play has been rearranged
somewhat, brushed up and generally
made more effective. The dream scene in
particular is well handled, and the setting
of the last three acts, the hall of the
Chateau Delaroche. is a really excellent
example of the scene painter's art.
E. J. Morgan appears in the title role,
and has therein a good opportunity for
the exercise of his peculiar tajents. He
has several strong scenes and makes the
most of them. Mary Van Buren as
Diane de Beaumont does her best work
of the present season. The role Is one
that demands a high degree of emotional
power, and Miss Van Buren last night
was fully equal to the occasion. She
played the exacting part Â¦with a surpris
ing truth and grace. It was never oxer
acted, but always of cleverly judged
emotional weight, never descending to the
bathetic that lies so perilously near.
Theodore Roberts is an admirable Due de
Beaumont, dignified and convincing, snd
Harrington Reynolds as the bad man of
the play, the Marquis de Vaux, al'as
Gouroc. was effective.
In the smaller parts J. R. Amory did a
clever sketch of the amiable coward, Dod
olphe Potin. and with Phosa McAllister,
as his wife, was responsible for xh'j
comedy of the drama. John Mason and
H. S v Duffield did excellent work in the
minor characters of General Delaroche
and Colonel La Hogue, and the rest of the
cast was acceptably filled.
As a picture of the French Revolution.
Mackaye's play is interesting, if by no

Columbia.
A picturesque glimpse of the "ould
country," a stirring "bit of romance, a
half dozen children anfi a generous num
ber of sentimental song's, are the in
gredients that are successfully mixed in
Chauncey Olcott s new play, "Garrctt
OMagh."
O'Maeh Is very like the plays that all
along have helped Olcott to sing his way
into popularity. It is the kind of a play
the public that follows the singing
comedian demands and in it he gives them
full measure of the entertainment they
desire.
Olcott carries with him a big company,
in which the juvenile â¢performers are equal
in number to the grown up members of
the company. Each person in the big- cast
has a little role to look after and which
goes to make up an altogether pleasing
ensemble.
Edith Barkus. into whose pretty ear
Olcott pours the gTeater number of his
ballads, is a very efficient support for the
star. Margaret Fitzpatrick takes excel
lent care of Mrs. Mary Derlin, the hero's
aunt, and Charles M. Collins is equally
careful of the role of Roger Xagle, the
heroine's father. Leslie Matthews, as
Alfred Spencer, is just as villainous as his
lines will permit of his being, and Louise
Marcelli, as Louise Wilton, is a very ef
ficient aid to him- in his lukewarm
wickedness. Olcott is booked for a two
weeks" stay at the Columbia, and judging
by the cordial reception tendered him last
.evening the engagement should prove a
"successful one.

ANSWERS "KIA"XEW TORK. July 22.â The unsettled condi
tion cf the speculative mind was clearly mani
fest when the stock market opened this morn
ing with a fresh batch of unfavorable news re
garding the corn crop and affecting also the
chances of the spring wheat crop. The
grangers and Pacifies and Southwesterns were
all acutely depressed and heavy blocks of
shares of each of these roads were thrown upon
the market, opening sales reaching as high as
10,000 ehares for Union Pacific. Conditions
were much like those of last Monday and the
trading contingent were Inclined to look for
some speculative support to the market as was
offered last Monday by the powerful capitalists
who have a paramount Interest In keeping up
the prices of their properties. The selling on
the thort eide alter the opening dip was there
fore conducted with signs of timidity and cau
tion. There was. In fact, effective support
offered at the opening low leveL But the in
cipient rally -was checked when the corn mar
ket opened and the excited condition of affairs
there was observed. The present market is
largely influenced by the close proximity of the
broker* In stocks and the brokers | in grains,
the Stock Exchange being in temporary quar
ters on a portion of the Produce Exchange
floor, with only half a wall dividing them. Not
only are the proceedings In each exchange to
be seen from the floor of the other, but brokers
ar* constantly parsing from one to the other
aad cj>erating en both. This jiersonal contact

NEW YORK, July 22.â The crowd which sur
rounded the corn ring was larger than usual
this morning. Brokers with their hands . full
of buying orders were constantly besieged by
messenger boys bringing dispatches that told
of continued hot, dry weather all over, the
belt. The bell at 9:30 o'clock transformed this
nervous crowd of brokers into a crowd of ex
cited men. To the gallery it looked like a
veritable Bedlam. News coming in from the
"West told of advances In price. There being
few sellers the price Jumped rapidly. Even
wheat was affected and before the day was
over robbed corn of its leading place and ab
sorbed most of the speculative interest. This
double market was something new on 'Change
and attracted the attention of the floor. The
bulls claimed tha. spring wheat was being
ruined by excessive" heat and- the public evi
dently believing the reports to a considerable
extent, sent in a stream of buying orders.
September, which closed Saturday at 73%c,
opened at li%c and by noon was up to 76c.
The strain was heavy, but as orders kept
coming prices kept rising until before the close
77%c was touched. Then a reaction to 77'Ac
followed with a later rise to . 77%c. Â» Foreign
houses bought freely on French account and
cables were generally strong and higher. Corn
although opening 2c higher at 60%c for , Sep
tember, kept right on jumping throughout the
day until 62%c was reached, or 4c rise for the
day, against 3@3 I / 4c net advance for wheat.

CHICAGO, July 22.â Wheat opened with a
/iemand for September from 69%c to 70%c, an
advance of %@%c to l%c-to l%c, due to higher
cables, rather bullish statistics, sympathy with
corn, but in greater degree to reports of heat
and drouth in the Ncrthwest coupled with
messages claiming damage had already reach
ed a serious stage. In the Dakotas and In
Minnesota many fields were said to have been
shriveled by the dry, scorching winds. Realiz
ing largely by the local professional Interest
caused an early drop to 69%@69%c. This sell
ing movement was of considerable weight, but
buying orders accumulated fast and after a
few moments of depression the market became
wild again and shortly after noon September
was' bid up to 73%c. Realizing sales again
exerted great pressure, but the market yielded
stubbornly and the close was excited and
strong, September 3%c over Saturday at 72%
@72Vic. ' Â¦ - ~
The bulk of the corn handled changed hands
at prices at least 3 cents better than Satur
day's level. There was a demand- so frantic
that It would have seemed almost reasonless
had It not been that traders were again con*
fronted with unlimited reports of . withered
crops throughout the corn belt, and a weather
forecast promising no relief. September opened
with a chorus of bids from 57c to 59c. Selling
by local longs Influenced an early reaction to
5Sc, but here the sweeping: demand from the
country, as well as from local , people, caught
the market and September scarcely stopped
advancing until 59%c had been paid for a email
lot. The close was strong, 4%c higher at 59%
@59%c. One of the reports which was Influ
ential said that a railroad was carrying back
to Kansas 200,000 bushels , of corn from Minne
sota. It was said therp were 6,000,000 bushels
more of the Kansas grown corn awaiting re
shlpment to the drouth stricken districts.
The oats market advanced actively in
sympathy with corn. It was a wide market all
day and an enormous business was transacted.
September closed 3@3VÂ»c higher at 3$Va@&>%c.
Provisions were moderately active. There
was a sharp demand for January, largely In
sympathy with corn. September was purchased,
on a more moderate scale. â¢ Septemi>er pork

Mall aflvleÂ«i from New York Bay: Further
buying of Sultana. Raisins to come from the
coast was again the only feature of interest
In the trade bere. In addition to the sales
already reported five cars were taken by local
Jobbers yesterday, making a total of thirteen
cars sold In the New York market out of the
twenty-ninÂ« cars bought on the coast by a
large commission house. New England has
taken a number of cars also and the block Is
now stated to be nearly sold up, the bulk of
bleached at Â£Â« coet. equivalent to 6%c. deliv
ered in this city. This price has now been
advanced He to 6%e here. The selling prices
of the bleached were '%c for prime. 7?(jC for
standard and f%c for choice, all delivered in
this market. These quotations etill stand,
t^pot supplies Â©f Sultanas are fair, but quota
tions are nominally unchanged.
Loose RaiÂ«=tne are dull. An order for a car
of 3-crown "mincemeat" raisins at 3%c, f. o. b.
coast, was reported turned down. Some little
demand is noted for layer Raisins. 3-crown
meeting a. email sale, at $1 50. Clusters, at
JI 75 are neg-lected. Two-crown seeded are sell
ing in a. small way at 6&c and 3-crown at 6tic
with the "etickcr" and at around C%c without
the â¢'Fticker."
Prunes are in very fair demand, considering
the seapox the poor berry crops in some sec
tions. It is believed, causing dried fruits to
receive- mow attention. Apricots are very
quiet, both, for spot and future.
Currants are uuiet and unchanged. So far
as can be learned the recent arrivals have had
no appreciable effect on prices. Mail advices,
report a decline oi 2s per cent in the London

THE COAST RECORD.
exaggerates the sentimental effect of the grain
market on the stock market. There were oc
casional rallies on the down grade, due to the
covering of board room bears, who took quick
profits. The loaning rate for stocks does not
indicate a widely extended short interest be
yond the in-and-out transactions by the board
room traders. The bearish operators are in
constant apprehension of some maneuver or
announcement by these interested in supporting
the market which would cause a sudden rally
and cost the shorts heavy losses. There was
no evidence of any such maneuver to-day, the
market yielding easily to every attack. But
there was a general disposition on the part
of the traders to close their contracts over
night and the demand from this source caused
a substantial rally in the late dealings run
ning from 1 to 3 points. At the low level the
inroads upon Saturday's prices were as fol
lows for leading stocks: Rock Island, 7%; Mis
souri Pacific, '%; Union Pacific, 6%; St. Paul,
6%: St. Louis, Southwestern preferred, 6;
Atchison. 4H: St. Louis and San Francisco sec
ond preferred, Z%; Kansas and Texas preferred
and Denver and Rio Grande preferred, 3% each.
There were many other losses of 1 to 3 points
at other points of the list and Baltimore and
Ohio was down 4% and New York Central 3%.
The United States Steel stocks moved narrowly
all day. The closing was quiet and steady,
with a good part of the rally maintained.
Railroad bonds were dull and weak. Total
sales, par value. $2,255,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

CLOSING.
The market here were upset by the flatness
in the American department which Is exerting
considerable influence here, although sentiment
was favorably disposed toward a - current
rumor that Lord Kitchener is about to resign
his post In South Africa for one in India, his
successor being General Bindon Blood. This
is regarded as an indication that the end of
the war is rapidly approaching. Americans
opened "sick" on the weakness In New York
last Saturday. There was an early rally for
about ten minutes, followed by renewed de
pression. Then New York came in as a seller,
finding few buyers here and the close was at
the lowest on the disappointing crop rumors
and a vague statement that a rather important
Wall street house was in trouble. *

: The' teamsters' strike made the fruit trade
look. very blue yesterday. Dealers found great
difficulty In receiving and delivering fruit, as
the teamsters of the large draylng companies
refused to haul to the canneries, deliver ship
ments to the steamers or haul from the wharves
and railroads to those stores which had been
patronizing jthe draylng companies. Those
dealers who own their own teams found less
difficulty, but all were more â¢ or less affected,
as the strike has many ramifications, which
operate in all sorts . of directions, and on all
sorts of dealers. An extension of the strike to
day is threatened, and this unsettled trade very
much. â¢ â¢
Under this condition of affairs ths market
was much quieter and the feeling was general
ly weak. Plums . and Pears alone â¢ of all \ the
tree f ruits. continued firm, while Peaches were
very '; weak and lower. Berry handlers report
ed considerable stock left on hand. It is feared
that a good deal of fruit will spoil on Â¦ the
wharves in consequence ot tne strike. As it is.
Peaches were - offered down to 10c per basket
on the wharf in the afternoon, and the receiv
ers were only too glad to let the surplus go at
that. , The -shipping, trade of the. port, as far
as fruit is concerned; is almost at a standstill:

The teamsters' strike Is hurting business In
this line ,by retarding the delivery of consign
ments from the country to the stores. Butter
Is In light supply, but the strike Is rendering
an otherwise firm situation weak. Cheese con
tinues firm under light supplies. Eggs, like
Butter, feel the strike, and the weakness men
tioned last week is thereby emphasized. Ranch

dealers on the outside did not lower (Prices they
quoted a very quiet and weak market.

The FORWARD REDUCTION COMPANY is, in its. own name and
through its subsidiary companies above named, the owner of
1. Dr. Chauncey B. Forward's process for refining crude petroleum and the- patents relat-
ing to and covering the same. .
This system Is particularly applicable to the refining of the heavy oils recently discov-
ered, of Louisiana. Texas and California.' Dr. Forward is a chemist and his process is
chemical, instead of the mechanical processes heretofore employed. These heavy oils do not
yield readily to any mechanical treatment, and Dr. Forward's process Is the only one which
reduces them readily enough and cheaply enough to answer commercial conditions
A reHnery to be established on tide water near the Texas and Louisiana oil fields and
capable cf treating twenty-nve hundred barrels of crude oil a day Is in process of construc-
* tlon and will be in operation some time during the present year
2. The oil rights on about 100,000 acres of land In Southwestern' Louisiana and Southeast-
ern Texas.
Several thousand acres of these lands we own In fee simple but on most of them wÂ»
have the usual oil lease which gives, us. the right to the oil and minerals on the DTODerty
.' subject to a payment to the owner of one-eighth or one-tenth royalty
In Jefferson County. Texas, and Calcasieu Parish. Louislana-whlch Include the leading
oil districts of their respective Statesâ we have larger holdings than any other oil company
The lands were selected by' Dr. Forward, or under his Immediate supervision. Those who
know the man will believe they- are well selected.
The stock of the FORWARD REDUCTION COMPANY is a particularfy
conservative investment for the following reasons:
1. The actual property rights of the company are of greater cash value than its total
capitalizationâ five million dollars. . Â¦
At tho price at which oil lands have been eelllnu In the oil regions of Texas and Louisi-
ana, ours , would bring very much more than the amount of our capitalization. On the most
conservative estimate they are yrell worth that sum. " '
2. More than half of the stock is still in the Treasury for Treasury purposes, after all
these lands have been acquired.
The process of selecting and acquiring lands is still going on. and with the experlene-
Ae has gained and the superior knowledge he now has. we may well expect Dr Forward
to do at l^st as well, with .the last half of the capitalization as he has with the first
Â¦ 3. We expect that the profits of the refining -part of the company's business alone-
leaving out of account altogether the company's investment In oil landsâ will pay substan-
tial dividends upon the cap tal stock.
i. The "reasonable possibilities before the company'' are i almost boundless. We are
' equipped with talent, expci-ience and money; and ready to take advantage of the manifold
opportunities that are now offering. . Â¦ -
If liquid fuel Is to bs. the fuel of the futureâ as many far-seeing men believeâ we shall
be among the foremost to share in the manifold profits c? its introduction.
â¢Â¦ The company is especially fortunate in. its leader. J.T. Forward Is a man of thorough
scientific knowledge, rare business "judgment, unquestioned personal integrity and with a zeal
for. this enterprise and a loyalty to -those .who support him in it such as are seldom foun.l
â¢ In men; -The company ! believe that. they, have in him a combination of those elements which
insure success.
.The names of the men associated with him In the enterprise are the names of success-
ful men who have merited and received the confidence of the community.
A limited amount of the socket the FORWARD F EDUCTION COMPANY^* o'fered

the prominent sportsman-mil
lionaire, is decidedly averse to
having his picture taken. Thus
far he has hanaged to evade the
persistent efforts of the camera fiends.
Published, pictures of the sportsman which

he is to-day.
Since the completion of his term as Sec

of the Secret Service has received a num
ber of bank notes printed from the orig
inal plates used by the State Bank of
New Brunswick, N. J., over fifty years
ago. The bank went out of existence some
time in the fifties and It was supposed
that the steel plates from .which its notes
were printed -were destroyed. It seems,
however, that these plates have fallen
into the hands of parties who have print
ed from them large quantities of notes,
which have been put into circulation from
New York to San- Francisco. A very
large percentage of the notes so far dis
covered are twos, although some ones and
fives are being sent in. Inasmuch as the
notes are not counterfeits of any United
States note or oblisatlon the makers and
passers cannot be prosecuted under the
United States laws. It appears that the
notes readily pass along the Canadian
frontier, as the takers think they are
notes of the Cajiadian province of New
Brunswick, the words "New Jersey" be
ing printed in small letters. The notes are
printed on bond paper and are quite as
good in every respect as the originals. It
is said that possibly $2,000,000 of these
notes are in circulation. . ;:Â«

ment of Justice has received a letter from
Judge Arthur H. Noyes of the United
States District Court at Nome, Alaska,
asking leave of absence to visit the
States. The desired permission was grant
ed and Judge Noyes will be allowed to
leave his post immediately upon receiving
the department's letter, which will prob
ably be in about a month.
Early in the spring the Attorney Gen
eral forwarded to Judge Noyea a copy of
the charges that had been filed In the
Department of Justice against him, al
leging malfeasance in office in connection
with the gold mining receiverships at
Nome. At that time he was . directed to
make his reply to the department by mail.
A few weeks ago, however, the United
States Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit
in California summoned Judge. Noyes i to
appear before it to answer to a charge'of
contempt in connection with the notorious
McKenzie receivership. As Judge Noyes
will have to appear in San Francisco in
October, it is presumed at the department
that he will avail himself of the oppor
tunity while in the United States of an
swering the charges against him in per
son to the Attorney General.
In Jail for Bigamy.
SAN JOSE, July 22.â Fred Noell Pinard,
a young man about 25 years of age, found
his way into the city prison to-night with
a charge of '. bigamy against him. In 1898
Pinard married Julia E. Alford, a pretty
Spanish girl. They lived together but a
short time. About ten days ago Pinard
procured a license to marry Mary Her
man. He intended to marry Stella Her
man, aged 17, but by a laughable mistake
got his prospective mother-in-law's name
instead of the daughter's. His first wife
heard of the issuing of the license, but
kept, quiet until the marriage was per
formed and the certificate recorded. Then
she went before City Justice Cobb and
charged Pinard with bigamy. Â¦ â¢

Edwards told the police that his wife
had left the house about 4 o'clock Sat
urday afternoon. He arrived home during
the evening and found her gone, the only
cause, so far as he could discover, being
the difficulties that confronted them. The
husband as the tears welled from his
eyes said: ' -
"That note convinces me that my wife
has committed suicide. She said she
would return, but I haven't seen a trace
of her anywhere, and I feel that she has
thrown herself into the bay." .
\ Edwards claimed he was unable to ob
tain employment at his trade of house
painting, because of non-membership in
the Painters' Union, being barred be
cause he is a member of the State militia.
The missing wife is 35 years of age, of
slender figure, light hair and blue eyes.
She wore a -dark skirt, light waist and
straw hat and carried away with her a
yellow hand satchel. Â¦_ , _
During her- melancholy moods Mrs. Ed
wards, her husband said, had threatened
to commit suicide. '
"Gone to the city.* Will be back-to pack
my things. Am tired of life. LETTIE."
The foregoing, written by Mrs. Lettie
Edwards on the back of an envelope, was
found by her husband, C. L. Edwards. In
their room at 542 Seventeenth street, Sat
urday evening. Mrs. Edwards left her
home a few hours before. Her anxious
spouse, after hunting without avail for his
missing wife, reported her disappearance
to the police to-day. He believes Mrs.
Edwards has committed suicide because
of despondency due to his inability to get
employment and the .urgent demands of
their landlady that they pay room rent,
now. overdue.

Alarming Epistle and
Disappears.
TIRED OF LIFE,
SAYS HER NOTE
SECRETARY WHITE of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children says he has recently re
ceived news which may lead to the
recovery of Roy Taylor and Joseph
Clifford, two little boys who wÂ«;re kid
naped in San- Francisco last spring. ThÂ»
children had been placed in the care of
the Ladies' Protective and Relief Associ
ation by relatives and mysteriously dis
appeared while on their way home from
school on April 15 of the present year. Jt
was subsequently asserted by the author
ities that the boys had been spirited away
by Mrs. Joseph Silva, an habitue of the
music halls on the Barbary Coast.
Mrs. Taylor of San Bruno and Mrs. Clif
ford of Oakland, the mothers of the boys,
immediately took up the search and no
stone was left unturned which might lead
to their recovery. Rewards were offered,
the authorities throughout the State were
*
notified and the two women themselves
hunted through all the vile dens of the
city in which the Silva woman, might be
found, but all to no avail.
The bereaved mothers are heart-broken
and exhausted with their fruitless search.
Mrs. Silva visited Mrs. Clifford shortly
after the disappearance of the boys and
threatened that if all efforts looking to
ward the recovery of the children were
not immediately discontinued, death would
be the penalty. Before the police could
be notified she was gone.
Secretary White and Officer McMurray
of the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children have been persistent in.
their efforts to find the lost ones. They
have at last got an inkling as to the
whereabouts of the Clifford boy and are
confident that Koy Taylor will Ue found
It is thought that Mrs. Silva has left the
State to avoid punishment for the deed.
She is the mother of Joseph Clifford, but
gave him away several years ago. She had
never shown any affection for the child
and the only motive which any one has
ever been able to suggest for the crime is
that she expected in some way to turn
the children into a source of revenue.

Ex-Judge Dudley Dubose arrived a-t the
Alameda County Jail this morning An
charge of Deputy United States Marshal
Gamble to begin serving his six months'
sentence for contempt of court, of which
he v.-as adjudged guilty last May, by the
United States Circuit Court in connection
with the Cape Nome receivership case
The deputy Marshal left Nome with his
prisoner July 7 and arrived in Oakland at
9 o'clock .this morning.
Dubose was cited for. contempt on ac
count of a speech in the military bar
racks at Nome last September during the
excitement over the wholesale seizure of
mines by parties" attempting to oust the
original claimants. The contestants had
Alexander McKenzie appointed receiver
pending the trial of - their claims before
the District Court. -
The original claimants secured a writ of
supersedeas from the Circuit Court : di
recting McKenzie to deliver the gold ta
ken ffom the disputed claims to the de
fendants. Dubose' s speech contained the
statement that his advice to his client, O..
J Comtois, one of the plaintiffs, as; con
testants, was, and would continue to be,
to disregard the writ and refuse to de
"Fhe^de^f the Circuit Courton which
Dubose is committed concedes that in so
far as the attorney was merely; advising
his" client of his rights on the^ ground
that the Circuit Court's writ would not lie
for lack of jurisdiction, he was justified in
expressing his opinion; but that Dubose

abetting Comtois in his resistance of the
order of the court, and thereby becoming
technically a co-conspirator to evade the
a The imprisoned attorney takes his "pun
ishment calmly, saying that there was a
differencte of opinion between himself and
the court as to whether he was in â¢ con
tempt but that the court's decision was
final and he should serve his sentence
with what grace he could master. ' . m J;
"I'm going back in six months, he
said "I have no idea of applying for a
pardon or anything of the kind. Â¦ ;
"The trouble arose- over something
which the court found I said with regard
to an order 'from the.courÂ£ last Septem
ber advising a client of mine that the
court had no jurisdiction and ' the order
was void. â¢ :
"The speech in question was made in
the barracks at Nome. A lot of the min
ers were making trouble. A mob was out
side the bank threatening to break into
the treasure vaults and -Â¦ take the money
to nay their back wages, which so far
had" been held up by the receivers. One
man tried to shoot McKenzie on the
street. Some of us? were at the barracKS
talking over the situation. - - :
"I give the story now as the court has
decided it occurred, I rose and stated, my
belief that the Circuit Court's order was
void for lac-c of jurisdiction and said that
the men who wanted 7 Major Van Arsdale,
the commander of the post before whom
the Informal conference was held, to break
into the bank and pet their money for
them were in the wrong. As a matter of
fact, I now know that the question of
iurlsdiction has been ' settled by the
United States Supreme Court in favor of
the position taken by the Circuit Court."

The deceased was born in Wisconsin,
but migrated westward in the early 60's.
For a number of years" he occupied the
humble position of stage driver and drove
out from Winnemucca. in the -State of
Nevada. Â¦ He .will probably be longest and
most favorably remembered in connection
with the faro bank conducted by the firm
of Ross, Webber & Carroll at 21 Mason
street. This bank, existing while gam
bling, with all its worst characteristics,
was at full swing in- this city, maintained
a record of unsullied fairness and honesty.
Through it Carroll won his reputation as
a square sport, who scorned' to take the
slightest advantage of- any one. Ross,
Webber & Carroll went out of business in
1895. but while they, continued in partner
ship-their faro bank was patronized, by
the. higher element of sportdom.
Although at one time Carroll amassed
a considerable fortune, he lost it through
unfortunate speculation. | For the past
few years he maintained several horses
and patronized to some extent ; the race
course. Last' spring, he 'made* a trip to
Nome, but . northern life did. not agree
with him and he soon returned to this
city. -< V - - Â¦ â¢ , '
Charitable to a. fault, while he . had
money he was. always ready to assist his
friend. He was ' never known to have an
enemy. The common mendicant of the
streets knew- him â¢ as their friend. Al
though a gambler, he was respected by
business men in every walk of life. .
He was about 50 .years of age. Some
twelve years ago he- married, but as his
domestic life did. not prove happy a
divorce soon followed. ' -

there was almost a reign of terror in the
Mission among women, owing to the ac
tions of a man who was known as "Peep
ing Tom." One woman, while in bed., had
been chloroformed by the man. He made
it a practice to : peep into women's bed
rooms while they were- retiring. He had
no .proof that Sanchiez was the "peeper,"
but there was a strong- suspicion agalnpt
him from the fact that he had been
arrested more than once for assaulting
little girls, and from his actions when
discovered by Mrs. Griffin.
Policeman Griffin said that Sanchiez
had his hands on the window of his wife's
bedroom and 1 was looking in when she
observec him.. He nearly scared the wits
out of her. The Judge said the bonds were
too low and increased them to $1000.

In Sunday's Examiner a special dis
patch dated Portland was published in
which United States Marshal J. C.
Franks was, as he avers, greatly ma
ligned. Marshal Pranks was virtually
charged with making a false return to a
process of court, and in reply thereto he
has â¢ sent the following explanatory com
munication to The Call:
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: In the issue
of the Examiner of Sunday, July * 1, my atten
tion was called- to a "special dispatch" from
Portland, Or., in which, my name is used In an
unlicensed, vindictive and libelous manner. It
Is stated that I, as United States Marshal, was
ordered to remove Mr. Carr*s fences in Modoc
County; that I went armed with the process of
the court to the scene and returned to court and
reported that the fences had been removed.
There is not one word of truth In this whole
statement, nor is there the slightest foundation
or excuse for the author of this dispatch for
making such a statement. It is viciously and
malignantly false.
The case in California courts mentioned In
this dispatch and pending while I was United
States Marshal never went to Judgment, and no
order or process of .. court. was ever issued or
placed in my hands to execute, anil the whole
statement is llbelously and maliciously false
and without any foundation in fact. I cannot
conceive where the inspiration found birth, save
as hereinafter stated, nor can I imagine who
could be so base as to manufacture out of whole
cloth a story so devoid of truth. â¢
Source of Charges.
The effect of the statement in this publication
is that I made a false return for reward and
that I am now reaping the fruits of my iniquity
by acting as superintendent of this property.
I went out of office in 1SD0, and I never had
anything to do with this property until within
the last three years, and then I bought some
stock in the Jesse D. Carr Land and Live Stock
Company and was elected its vice president,
since which time I have at times for the corpo
ration visited the property, inspected it and ad
vised with the superintendent about Its manage
ment, but -without any compensation whatever
other than to be reimbursed for my actual ex
penses. I-know of my own personal knowledge
who the witnesses are that were subpoenaed
for the Government in the case at Portland,
Or., but I do not know what they or either of
them testified to upon the trial of the case; but
I am confident that none ur them presumed to
make any such statements as would in/ any way
sustain the charges made in the dispatch men
tioned. Â¦
I therefore believe these charges emanated
from others and were inspired by one who has
large, herds of stock, three head to one owned
by our company, who ranges his stock on the
public flomaln for a distance of sixty miles,
and at times rocle>o3 them and drives them thirty
to forty miles to encroach upon the, lands in
our inclosure, and who has not been enterpris
ing enough even to build corrals within which
to handle his stock, but has used our corrals.
He has with his vast herds <M.*t=USted the natu
ral grasses of miles and mile.? of country in
and about- the Butte Creek and Yokohama sec
tion's, where there are a great many poor set
tlers with small herds of stock r.nd whom he
has attempted to drive out of tlu* country by
forcibly holding and controlling the waters of
this section. As to how this man became pos
sessed of such vast herds of stock the widows
and orphans of the community up there have
been heard to complain and some have even
gone so far as to Institute suit to determine.
True he owns some land and some he has
made partial payments on. but making default
for years in the payment of the accruing inter
est due the State and getting the benefit of the
us of them in the meantime without further
outlay. He Is practically a forager on the pub
lic domain and on his neighbors, and was re
cently indicted by the United States Grand
Jury of the Northern District of California for
having unlawfully inclosed large tracts of the
public domain.
Largest Taxpayer in County.
It is charged in this dispatch that "the
â¢cattlemen and ranchers within- 2C0 . miles of
Carr, it ia Â¦ claimed, have wittered from his
encroachments. , Fights and blood-spilling were
the rule between Carr'a men and others." Mr.
Carr, the original Â¦ owner of the property of
our company, has expended over a Quarter <if
a million dollars In improving .that country,
which gave employment to and maintained a
great many poor people, and, while it is ad
mitted that he inclosed a large area, of pub
lic land in with his private holdings, he at
the same time has purchased from and paid to
the State and Government fcr about 21,000 acres
of lands upon which he pays taxes, and, I
believe, he is the largest taxpayer in Modoc
County. Instead of our neighbors, cattlemen,
complainlne of our "encroachments." as it is
styled in this dispatch, most of them common
their stock Â«pon our lands with our cattle and
our men are instructed not to interfere with
them. ' Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦/â¢â¢jte'*?
It is not true that Mr. Carr or any. one con
nected with or in the employment of our com
pany ever interfered with .any one entering
upon the public land within our Inclosure. On
the contrary, gate3 and open ways are main
tained at convenient points in the fence to ac
commodate the neighboring settlements and no
one was ever denied ingress or egress to these
lands. In justification of Mr. Carr, let it be
known that he constructed these fences before
there was any statute prohibiting: It to be done
and at a time when the State laws recognized
and taxed Â¦ possessory claims and : authorized
the fencing of them. . Â¦ ' . Â¦
It is absolutely untrue that there were fights
and Â¦ bloodshed . between Mr. Carr's raen and
others. On the contrary, Mr. Carr has always
been esteemed by his neighbors up there and
admired for his enterprise, his neighborly kind
ness and generosity. The fact of having pub
lic lands inclosed with his own Mr. Carr never
denied, but the other charges made in this dis
patch against Mr. Carr are wholly without
foundation, and are stated with such brazen
disregard for truth that It bristles with, malice
bias and "animosity wholly unpardonable. - - -

Judge Thomas F. Graham has rendered
a decision in the Superior Court ln'which
all the allegations made In a sensational
.complaint by Allan R. Partridge against
Frank W. Page, George W. Baker. Harry
L. Baker, the Vulcan Smelting and Kefln
lng Company. William H. O'Bryan, J. D.
Heard and sixty-two other defandant
stockholders of the smelting and refining
company are found to be wholly untrue
and unsupported by any proof submitted
by Partridge. Judge Graham also said
that it was apparent to the court that the
action of F. W. Page, George W. Baker
and all other directors and officers of the
company has been fair and honest and for
the best interest of all the stockholders
and that every allegation made by Part
ridge to the contrary was unfounded and
inspired by malice. Tne' temporary in
junction against the company which was
granted on Partridge's motion has been
dissolved and the complaint dismissed
with costs to the defendant. Â¦Â»
Makes Charges Indiscriminately.
Partridge's complaint was filed last
February. In it President F. W. Page,
Vice President George IV. Baker and Sec
retary Harry L. Baker were charged with
flagrant violation of duty and all sorts of
fraud and conspiracy against Partridge,
Â¦who was a director and large stockholder
in the company. The court was asked to
remove them from office and to cancel
their stock. The averments, made under
oath, were so circumstantial that extracts
were published in The Call as a matter of
news. The case was originally assigned
to Judge Seawall for trial. Partridge dis
missed the bill on the day set for the
* hearing. He immediately filed a new com
plaint, in which the old charges were re
iterated, additional specifications were
made and fifty other defendants, the
stockholders of the company, were in
cluded. The new action was assigned for
trial to Judge Graham. .
Judge Scores Partridge.
The full text of Judge Graham's decree
is as follows:
In the above entitled action, the court being
fully advised in the premises and the whole
matter having: been submitted to the court,
upon the complaint of the plaintiff, and the
answer of the defendant, it is adjudged and
decreed as follows:
Firstâ That a Judgment and decree be en
tered herein in favor of said defendants and
all of them and against said plaintiff for their
cons herein expended.
Secondâ That all of the allegations of the
complaint, charging a fraudulent or any con
spiracy upon the part of said defendants or
any of them against said plaintiff are wholly
untrue and unsupported by any proof sub
mitted by the plaintiff.
Thirdâ That it is apparent to the court that
the action of eaid F. W. Page. George W.
Baker and all other directors and officers of
raid defendant corporation has been fair and
honest and no cause has been disclosed by the
proof or admissions of counsel to support in
any way the allegations in the complaint, and
raid action has been shown to be of such a
character to promote the best interests of all
the stockholders thereof, and that every allo
cation to the contrary in said complaint is
wholly unfounded and inspired by malicious
motives upon the part of the complainant
herein.
That the temporary restraining order here
tofore Issued by this court in favor of said
plaintiff and against said defendants and every
part thereof is hereby dissolved.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set ray
hand this 22d day of July, 1901, and have caused
the great seal of the Superior Court of the city
end county of San Francisco to be affixed
hereto. THOMAS P. GRAHAM,
Judg-e of the Superior Court.

corps of that commandery a magnificent
beauseant in token of his appreciation of
its perfect rendition of the Templar drill.
Colonel Frank W. Sumner accompanied
the presentation with a speech express
ing the sentiments of the donor. The
beauseant was accepted for the corps by
Colonel Edwards, the commandant, who
promised that the battle flag shall ever
be cherished by the corps and that wher
ever the corps goes the flag will go with
it. It was then placed in the keeping of
the color guard, Sir Knights J. R. Aitkin,
George I>. Darling - and ML Ryan, | after
which followed the impressive ceremony
of consecrating the beauseant by the
prelate and past eminent commander.
After the close of the" session of the
commandery there was an adjournment to
tne banquet hall, where an excellent sup
per was partaken of by nearly two hun
dred Sir Knights. Speeches appropriate
to the occasion were made by Riajht Emi-
nenl Grand Commander of California
George B. McKee. Colonel F. "W. Sumner,

Campbell, Past Commander Robert Mc-
Millan and J. R. Aitkin.
The beauseant is the original vexillum
belli, battle flag of the Knights Templar,
which was adopted in 1167. It became
their sacred insignia, whereby they were
distinguished when In battle, and waa
carried in every engagement with the
Saracens. It was of Â¦woolen; stuff, the up-
per half of the banner being black Â¦ and
the lower half whiter â black to typify ter
ror to the foe and white that the Knights
walked in the innocence and. p'urity of
Christ. "Beauseant" was also the war
cry of the Templars. Originally the beau
seant ' was one-third in breadth of what
it was in depth, but now it is almost
square. The one that was presented last
