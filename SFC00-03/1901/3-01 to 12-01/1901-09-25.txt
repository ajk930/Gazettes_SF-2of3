Buffalo. He said there were so many peo

CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL.
Assassin Convicted of Murder in the
First Degree.
BUFFALO, N. Y., Sept. 24.â The trial
of Czolgosz was resumed to-day with
every prospect of a swift conclusion.
- The crowd about the courtroom to-day
was slightly larger than yesterday. The
vigilance of the police was In no way re
laxed. The same careful scrutiny of each
person entering the court was observed.
The courtroom", owing to the care exer
cised by the Sheriffs and police as to who
was admitted, was nearly empty fifteen
minutes before the time of opening, but
it filled quite rapidly after that. ,s Â¦
Dr. Mann Cross Examined.
There were many more â¢ ladles in the
audience to-day than yesterday. The
prisoner was 'orought over from the jail
at S:45 and placed in the same chair as
yesterday. Members of the Grand Jury
which . indicted him were present as
guests of the District Attorney and oc
cupied seats back of the clerk's chair.
â¢Doctors Mynter, Mann and Fowler came
in early and Dr. Mann was ready to take
the stand at once for cross-examination.
At 9:50 the members of the jury filed in
and took their seats. > . : (
It became known this morning that ap
plication for seats had been made by
representatives of several anarchist pa
pers, but they have been refused.
Justice White arrived exactly at 10 and
the crier Immediately uttered the formal
notice of the. opening of court. The jury
men 1 - were polled and Samuel J. Fields,
chief engineer of the Pan-American Ex
position, was ? recalled to the witness
stand. He was asked by District Attor
ney Penney the meaning of a certain fig
ure, on the floor plan of the Temple of
Music. He said it was intended to show
the direction which the people : took in
entering the building passing in front of
the President and then out of the building.
Dr. Matthew D. Mann was then called
for cross-examination. ' ,.
"Was the condition which you' found at
the autopsy to be expected from the na
ture of the wounds which the President
received?" asked Lewis. ; ;..-.! ;<,
"It was not-expected, arid was very fun
usual. I never saw anything just" exactly
like it," replied Dr. Mann.
"To what, then, do you attribute the
symptoms ' qr indications which you dis
covered, the gangrenous condition of the
wound?" ;-,'.-
"It is very difficult to explain it. It may
be due to one of several things. I think
it would be necessary for further exami
nation to be made before any definite ex
planation could be made. That would be
the duty of the pathologists."
-' "You have no opinion in the matter?" -\
"I have no positive opinion.'!
- "I presume therefore that the optimis
tic bulletins that were issued from time
to time by; the. physicians were without
any knowledge or Â¦ suspicion of these
symptoms . that were' afterward discov
ered?" â¢' ' -:>,:'; - Â¦ 'Â¦ Â¦Â¦'* ; .'. . 'Â¦'.-. ",. ~
"The bulletins -were optimistic in that
they gave no idea of what was to come,",
was the reply. "The bulletins expressed
no opinion. They merely stated facts,, but
the opinions which were held by the staff
seemed to be fully warranted by the con
dition of the President. -We had no reason
to suspect the existence of any, such state
of affairs as was found." . /
"Now, doctor, you say it was due to
several causes.; Can. you^ give either of
them?", >%? : Â¦
v "The ' entrance of germs into the . parts
may have' been one of the . causes. "... The
very low ifltate of vitality may have been
one cause. The action of the pancreatic
juice may have been* one 1 ; undoubtedly It
contributed to it." Â¦. â¢ ; ..-'-..,â¢.- r~, -. Â¦â¢-Â¦

Justice White began his charge to the
Jury at 3:29. He arose and stepped to the
side of the bench nearest the jury box.
He said: â¢
Justice White's Charge.
"Think again, gentlemen;, here is a man
who does not want a lawyer, who does
not believe in God nor in lawâ a man who
does not- believe in the married relation
yet our laws are such that he is defended
by two of the ablest jurists in our city,
as if he were the most respected defend
ant and even comes Into' court and says
he is guilty. Yet, gentlemen, you are re
quired under the constitution to listen to
the formal presentation of the evidence,
notwithstanding that this man does not
wunt it* * " *r *'
"Gentlemen, I have said all I have to
say. I have said more,, perhaps, than I
ought to say. You have sworn to give
him a fair trial on the evidence. Now,
what is the evidence? I say as It has
been "presented to you it fully substanti
ates the crime charged.
"The duty of counsel on both sides is
ended. The court will charge you briefly;
then it will be your duty to take up the
case. No doubt the same thought, the
same object, Is in ail our mindsâ that, al
though our beloved country has lost her
greatest man, it still should maintain the
respect of the whole world, rand it should
be made known to the whole -world that
no man can come here and commit such a
dastardly act and not receive ' the fuir pen
alty of the law." i- , -. v.;".-.
"The national heart was /broken,
and it will take God's way and time
to heal it. It was broken by a class
of people who are coming to our
country in increasing numbers, and
while harbored by our laws, are pro
pagating their malicious views; a
class of people that must be taught
that we have no place for them on our
shores, a class of people that must
be taught that they cannot take the
life of any one irrespective of conse
quences.
"Think, gentlemen, of that grand man
who stood, only a few days ago, in the
Temple of Music, and how. he came from
the lowly walks of life, how he was, first
a schoolteacher,- then a lawyer, then, .a
Judge, a Governor, a Congressman and
then a President of the United States,
and, above all, a loving husband, and
that on Â¦ the last "day he [ said: "It's
God's way; good-by, all; good-by,' a man
bo gTeat- thaWhei could raise his hand and
save his own" assassin, a man who could
shake the hand of even the very worst
man you could Imagine.
-. "It is a great lesson that so great a
man can stoop so- low, that he was so
great that he could forgive his own as
sassin." He was the noblest man, I be
lieve, God ever created. A man who stood
near him in the Temple of Music said to
me: 'I have traveled in all parts of the
world and Have seen people assembled to
greet their r rulers, but when I saw the
people stand in the railroad stations and
along the country through which the fu
neral train passed, that they might get a
look at the casket of this great man, I
was convinced as never before that -there

dent, but the law must be vindicated.
This 'terrible thing has happened because
there are people in this country who, un
less they feel the irresistible force of
prompt and proper action in ; this case,
will cause something awful to happen to
our beloved^country. Â¦
The room was not warm? but he Â¦, fre
quently.took his handkerchief from r his'
pocket and mopped the perspiration from
his forehead and cheeks. <Â¦ At no time tlur-.
ing the absence of the Jury .did he; raise
his eyes or lift his .head or seem to know
that he was the object of Interest of bev
eral hundred men and women. -Every time
the door was opened air eyes were turned
in that* direction, the " evident , thought in
every mind being that thejury would* only â¢Â¦
take a few minutes to agree on a verdict.!
i It was 4;35 , when the Â¦ crier .rapped; for
: Titus also asked the court to charge the
jury v "that if they were satisfied from the
evidence that at the time of the commit
tal of the assault the defendant ; was la
boring under such a defect of reason as
not to know the quality of the act or that
it was wrone he was not responsible and
the jury must-acquit." .
I so charge," said the Judge.
After the jury had retired to consider
the evidence the- scene in the courtroom
became t dramatic in the extreme. De
corum was somewhat forgotten and spec
tators stood Up; and" many walked about
the room and engaged in â¢ conversation.
The guards about the assassin, who'still
sat in his seat before the . bench, wore
doubled. Chief of Detectives Cusac and
two of his men taking positions just back
of Czolgosz' chair. Others took seats to
the left and right, andmany plain clothes
men were seen mingling among the crowd
surging about the'room, closely watching
every i one whose face was- not â¢ familiar
to them. There was no disposition to
crowd about the prisoner, although Â¦ the
object of every one seemed; to be in a
position to command a full view of hl3
face. Czolgosz had been seated In his
chair all the afternoon, his hands clasped
on the arms of the chair and his 'head
bent forward and a little to the left. . Â¦
V Verdict of "Guilty." ; V ' '
Justice White then ordered the jury- to
retire and bring in a verdict. Just before
they did so, however, District Attorney,
Penney requested the Judge to charge the
jury that the law presumes every Individ
ual sane unless proved otherwise, and the
court said to them: ; ",.
"The court presumes the defendant in.
this case sane." . '- \ . .
Defendant Is Presumed Sane.
"If the act was not premeditated he Is
guilty of murder in the second degree. If
the shot was fired accidentally and with
out premeditation he is guilty of man
slaughter in the first degree. It is not
necessary for me to discuss the question
of manslaughter In the second degree in
this case." \ Â»
"It Is proper that I should define the'
crime of murder in the first and second
degrees and manslaughter in the first and
second degrees. If the defendant on Sep
tember 6 did wrongfully, assault, shoot or
wound William McKinley by means al-'
leged in the indictment, \ and if the act
was committed with premeditated design,
and If the act was the sole and approxi
mate cause of death, and if the defendant
knew he was doing wrong at the .time, the
defendant is guilty of murder in the first
degree. < : . . . , > .
"I ''deplore any incitement to vio
lence and the man who is ready to go
cut and commit a crime because some
other man had committed one is as
guilty as the latter, and his act is as
reprehensible." s
the defendant has acknowledged his guilt.
Such an acknowledgment in such circum- \
stances cannot go , to the jury or to the
court. The law requires that the defend
ant charged -with such â¢ a crime must be
tried. The ; law says that all the facts
must be observed and reviewed by., you.
The law guarantees that the. defendant
shall have a fair trial by twelve men- im
partial and fair, capable of taking the tes
timony of the trial and giving it thorough
consideration. . If, when all the circum
stances.of the. case are considered by you,
there still exists in, your minds a reason
able doubt that the defendant is not
guilty, you cannot find this man -guilty. <:
"The people have submitted evidence
tending to show that this, man'committed
this Â¦ crime: they-' have 'given evidence
tending to show that it was premeditated.
If you are satisfied that there was de
sign and. premeditation, and if in accord T
ance with .that premeditation and design
thes*> shots were fired, then the defendant
is guilty of the crime of murder in the
first degree. You must. consider all this
evidence that the people have submtlted

without prejudice. You are the sole
judges of the facts in this case.
"The jurors must find him guilty be
yond a reasonable doubt. You may ask
what is a reasonable doubt. While a great
deal has been written and said on the
definition of 'reasonable doubt,' in this
case it means that, the jurors are bound
to sift, compare and examine all the evi
dence, and if in their minds there is any
doubt as to the defendant's guilt they are
bound to acquit the defendant. If there is
no doubt in your, minds then you are
bound to bring in a verdict of conviction.
I am very glad that up to the -present
stage of this lamentable affair, so far. as
the. jury and the people of this city are
concerned, there has been shown that re
spect for the law that. is bound to teach
a valuable lesson. The defendant has
been given every advantage of expe

"Mr. Penney and the' Assistant District
Attorney had some conversation and then
the prisoner, in reply to questions, stated
that he had killed the President because
he believed It to be his duty. He under
stood the position in which he had placed
himself and - was willing to take his
chances. Czolgosz said he had gone to
the falls on the previous day with the in
tention of shooting the President, but was
unable to carry outh~s intention. He
came to Buffalo and got in line 'with the
people, at the Temple of Music- The de
fendant told how he concealed his
weapon; how he kept his hand concealed
In his pocket while waiting to reach a
point in front of the President's side.
When he reached a point in front of the
President he fired. If he had not been
stopped, he said, he would have fired more
shots."
: "Did he say anything about planning
to kill the President on any other occa
sion?" asked District Attorney Penney.
"He said he had been watching the
President for three or tour days for a
favorable opportunity of shooting."
"Did he give any reasons for wishing
to kill the President?"
"Yes; he said that he did not believe
In the present form of government or In
any of the Institutions in It. He said ho
had for several years studied the doc
trine of anarchy. He believed in no gov
ernment, no marriage regulations, and
said he attended church for some time,
but they talked nonsensa and he would
not continue there." ' \
"He said he did not bellove In the church
or state?" asked Penney.
"Yes; he said he believed In free love.
He gave the names of sÂ«sveral papers he
had readâ four of themâ and he mentioned
one known as Free Society."
"He mentioned several places where he
had been and where he heard these sub
jects discussed?" asked Penney.
"Yes, he said he. lived in Cleveland, and
that before he came to Buffalo he had
been in Chicago. He said he had been
informed by.' the teachings of Emma
Goldman and â¢ by another woman living
in Cleveland, whose name I don't recall."
On reaching police headquarters the

Quackenbush was shown a photograph
of the interior of the building and indi
cated the points referred to in his testl>

Cross-examined by Titus, Quackenbush
told how the President was taken from
the building to the ambulance and where
the prisoner, was at -that time. -

"No," was the reply, without hesita

When Shots Were Fired.
Louis L. Babcockj who was in charge
of the ceremonies in the Temple of Music
on the day of the shooting, followed Dr.
Mann. He gave details of the arrangt'
ment for the reception and described the
position of the President and points of
entrance and exit from the Temple .of
Music, and told where he stood when the
fatal shots were fifed. ' * â¢ .
"I heard two ' shots. I immediately
turned "to the left. I saw the President
standing still and he was deathly pale..
In front of him was a group of men, bear
ing the prisoner to the floor." .
"Did you recognize any of the men in
tha group?" ' '
"Yes, the artillerymen and two secret
service men. They threw the prisoner to
the floor in. a second. I did not recognize
the men who took the pistol away from
the prisoner. ' The hall - was at once
cleared." - . 'Â¦Â¦ â¢ . â¢ . . â¢ â¢ âââ¢
"What became of the prisoner then?
' "He was -surrounded by detectives and
secret service men. There was some con
troversy aB to who had the right to the
prisoner, but that was quickly settled and
he was taken to a side room and later to
police headquarters." -
Edward R. Rice, chairman of the Com
mittee on ceremonies in the Temple of
Music, was next called. , ' -
"Where were you at 'the time of. the
shooting?" asked District Attorney Pen-"
Rice indicated the spot on the ground

President stood. "Â¦Â¦Â¦'>'Â¦ Â¦Â¦',. â¢\ t _ i \ l
"Tell -us what you saw," .said District

"As chairman of the committee on cere

time for the reception was nearly up. At

"It is also a presumption of law that
every man is sane until he is proven in
sane. Evidence tending to show that the
prisoner was insane has not been forth
coming; it has been proven that he was
the agent of the crime, and there should
be no question in your miwis as to the re
sponsibility of the defendant.
"This is no time for oratorical display.
Counsel for the prisoner and myself have
endeavored "to eliminate all sensational
ism from this case. It is not my inten
tion to Indulge in extended remarks. You
understand the responsibility resting upon
you. The counsel has said there 'should
be no lynch law in this State. He has
told you that the people of Buffalo are
to be commended for the spirit displayed
by them since the murder of the Presl-
Presumption of Law.
"The counsel for the defense says if the
defendant was sane, he was responsible
and that if he was insane he must be
presumed to be innocent. He tells you
that this is a presumption of law.
"It Is hardly possible for any man to
stand and talk about this case without
the deepest emotion. It was the most
awful tragedy that ever came upon the
world. We have shown you how this de
fendant in the Temple of Music
that afternoon and shot down our be
loved President. We have shown you how
he deliberately planned this awful crime.
We have shown you how he attended an
archistic and socialistic meetings, at
which were sown in his heart the seeds
of his terrible act.
Titus then arose and said that Judge
Lewis had so completely covered the
ground that it seemed entirely unneces
sary for him to reiterate it, and he would,
therefore, say nothing.
At 10:30 District Attorney Penney began
summing up. He spoke in a clear, well
modulated voice, and every word could
be heard in any part of the room. He
said: U:
Lewis was crying when ne finished and
the eyes of many of those in the court
room were filled with tears.
Weeps as He Finishes.
"I had the profoundest respect for
President McKinley. I watched him
in Congress and during his long pub
lic career, and he was one of the no
blest men God ever made. His policy
we care nothing about, but it has al
ways met with my profoundest re
spect. His death was the saddest
blow to me that has occurred in many
years." â¢
"The law presumes the defendant inno
cent until he is proven guilty, and we
start with the assumption that the de
fendant was not mentally responsible fcr
the crime he committed. "We have not
been able to present any evidence upon'
our part. The defendant has even refused
on almost every occasion to talk to his
counsel. He has not aided us, so we have
come here unaided to consider this im
portant question. But I know there is In
every human being a strong desire to live.
Death is a specter that we all dislike, to
meet, and here this defendant, without
having any animosity against our Presi
dent, without any personal motive, so far
we can see, committed the act which he
knew, if he was sane, must cause his
death. How can a man with a sane mind
perform such an act? The rabble in the
streets will say, no' matter whether He
be insane or not, he deserves to be killed.
The law, however, says that you must'
consider the circumstances and see if he
was. in his right mind or not when he
committed the deed. If you- find be was
not responsible, you would aid in lifting
a great cloud from the minds of the peo
ple of this country. If the beloved Presi-'
dent had met with a railroad accident andv
been killed, our grief could not comparo'
with what It is now: If you find that-he.
met his fate through the act of an insane
man. it is the same as if be met it by ac
cident.
-"Here was a man occupying an
exalted position, a man of irreproach
able character; he was a man -who had
come here to assist us in promoting
the prosperity of our great exposi
tion. And he was shot down while
folding a reception. His death has
touched every heart in this commu
nity, and in the world, and yet we sit
here quietly considering whether this
man was responsible for the act ho
committed. That question is one that
you are called to decide. . ;
"This trial hfcre is a great object lesson
to the world. Here is a case where a man
has stricken down the beloved President
of his country in broad daylight in the
pretence of hundreds of thousands of
spectators. If ever there was a case that
would excite the anger, the wrath of
these "who' saw it was this one, and yet,
vnder the advice of the President, *L#t no
or.an. hurt him,' he was taken, confined in
our prison, indicted, put on trial here and
the case is soon to be submitted to you
as to whether he is guilty of the crime
charged against him. That, gentlemen,
speaks volumes in favor of the orderly
conduct of the people of the city of Buf

my profession, the news came that a
colored man had gone up on the shores
of.Owasco Lake and there had murdered

to -hear the news. In the course of the
afternoon It was learned that the man,
Freeman, had been arrested and was be
ing- brought to the city to be incarcerated.
The people upon the streets became more
and more excited. They began, to talk
about mobbing: the colored man when: he
arrived. William H. Seward, who lived
in that city, appeared upon the street
and counseled moderation, counseled the
people to wait and see whether the man
â¢was really guilty of the crime or not,
and permit him to have a legal trial. But
the people protested. He was guilty, they
raid, and must be disposed of. Mr. Sew
ard . insisted and they put Freeman in
jaiL It 6oon became known that Mr.' Sew
ard had volunteered to defend the negro
when he was put on trial, and indignation
arose against him, but that far-seeing
man, that statesman, saw that then was
an opportunity of giving an object lesson
to the world as to the proper disposition
of that case, and for two long months
the trial went on with Seward defending
the negro. It occupied some three weeks
in obtaining a Jury, and I sat by almost
during the entire proceedings of that trial
and listened to the defense that Mr. Sew
ard interposed. Not that he cared any
thing for the negro, but he wanted to
maintain . the law. giving every man a
trial, and to Dut-down mob violence.

man grabbed the prisoner first and then

Judge Titus, in crcss-examinatlon.
"Yes; I thought I heard him say, 'BÂ«

DR. SCHTFFMANN'S REMEDIES.
ASTHMA INSTANTLY RELIEVED
Dr. It. Schiffmann Astounds' the Pub-
lic With the Success of His
Treatment.
Residents of this place were astonished
by notifications In these columns that the
celebrated physician. Dr. Rudolph Schiff-
mann, would make public test of his rem-
edy in this city on September 19. He In-
vited every man, woman and child suffer-
ing with Asthma to call at "Win. J. Bry-
an's drug store and obtain, absolutely
free, a trial box of his medicine. Dr.
Schiffmann adopted this novel way of In-
troducing his treattaent, believing that a
'ree personal test would be the best and
only way to overcome the prejudice and
skepticism of thousands of asthmatics
who had given up in despair after going
through the whole range of so-called
cures. He has in this manner proved tha
efficacy of his remedy, and without ask-
ing the public to upend a penny. Dr.
Schiffmann hopes that every sufferer in
this town obtained one of his free sam-
ples. He fears, however, that there were
some few who did not before they were
all given out. In order to give a fair op-
portunity to those who have not yet used
the\ remedy, and also as a guarantee of
good faith, he has now requested this
paper to announce that he has arranged
with the above druggista to refund the
money to any perse n who purchases of
them either a 60c or $1.00 package of
Schlffmann's Asthma Cure between now
and October 25, and finds that It does not
do exactly as is claimed for it; the only
condltionr^being that they return not less
than three-fourths of the package to
them.' Dr. . Schlffmajin." claims that in
every case of true asthma his remedy
will give Immediate reliefâ usually, within,
fifteen seconds: always within as many
minutes. It has- positively permanently
cured thousands of cues which were con-
sidered Incurable.

Reviews Terrible Crime.
District Attorney â¢ Penney began the
summing up of the case for the prosecu
tion at 3:10. He reviewed the conclusive
evidence of the terrible crime presented
to the jury in a clear, concise manner.
They had carefully avoided, he said, any
unnecessary display, of indecency.
"The question is a simple' one," said Mr.
Penney. "No evidence has been presented
here to show that this man is insane. Un
der the presumption of the law that this
man is sane we must consider him so.
When you consider the frightful crime,
the enormity of the offense, how short
should be your deliberations. My remarks
to you to-day shall be brief. It is not my
intention to sway you by any expressions
of mine. Enough evidence has been pro
duced here to prove this crime. There is
a certain class of people in this country
who must be taught that the law is su
preme. They must be given a terrible ex
ample of the majesty of the irresistible
force of the law that they would tear
down."
During the address to the court Czolgosz
sat with flushed face, his head slightly in
clined to one side. Â¦ â¢
District Attorney Penney ended his ad
dress at 3:27.
Judge White then spoke In a clear voice.
"This man." he said, "is charged with
murder in the first degree. The law guar
antees that he shall be tried by a body of
honest, intelligent men. He has received
such a trial. If you are satisfied that this
man fired the shots that killed President
McKinley it is your duty to find him
guilty. If any doubt rests in your minds
he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.
You are the sole judges of all the facts
presented in the court."
"Guilty," Finds the Jury.
Judge White showed â¢ great emotion
when he spoke of the life of President
McKinley. In closing he said: .
"If on the 6th day of September the de
fendant did willfully, without cause/shoot
and wound President McKinley and such
assault was committed with a premedita
ted plan; if euch shooting and wounding
resulted in the death of President Mc-
Kinley. you will find this defendant guilty
of murder in the first degree."
He explained to the jury the different
degrees of murder. â¢
District Attorney Penney then asked the
Judge to charge the jury that the law
presumes every individual sane until
proved otherwise. Judge White in reply
said to the jurymen:
"The law presumes the defendant in this
case sane."
The jury retired to consider the evi
dence at 3:51 o'clock.
At 4:26 the jury returned and announced
a verdict of guilty of murder injtha first
degree. . : .
The court adjourned at 4:28. Before ad
journment Judge White announced that
he would pronounce sentence upon the de
fendant on Thursday afternoon at 2
o'clock. This was at the suggestion of the
District Attorney. Czolgosz was imme
diately taken back to his cell, and to all
appearances had been in no way affected
by the result of the trial. . .

SAN JOSE, Sept- 24â Because Dr. Ben
jamin H. Holmes loved too ardently, but
not wisely, he was committed to Agnews
Asylum to-day. Some time ago Holme*
appeared In San Francisco, and catching
sight of Miss Fife, the niece of the lata
millionaire Liming, fell desperately in love
with her. He shadowed her footsteps,
and whenever she appeared in church or
other public places Holmes was alwayss
near, iVt church he requested ot tto
ushers an introduction to her. *
About a month ago MIhs Fife's parents
removed to Palo Alto, and the young lady
was congratulating herself that she hai
shaken her admirer. Thi;Â» f eellns of free
dom was short-lived, for a day or two
later Holmes appeared. He engaged quar
ters across the street from the Fife resi
dence, and on the steps of his boarding
house he maintained a vigil day and
night. Holmes wrote lotg rambling love
letters to Miss Fife, and after waiting
some time without seeing her he called
at the house. The door of the Fife horaa
was slammed in his face, but he remained
on the doorsteps. He declared he was
going to stay there until he could see tha
young lady. .
A warrant was secured and Holmes was
arrested for disturbing the peace. Justice
Van Buren sentenced nini to twenty days
In the County Jail. There. was no ques
tion of his insanity, and when his sentence
"expired yesterday he wtis charged witn
Insanity. To-day he was examined and
committed to Agnews.
But little is known of Holmes here. It
is said that some yearn ago he was a
leading practitioner of Denver, Colo,, but
he became involved in "shady practice"
and was sued for damages by a young
lady. Holmes is believed to be a man of
means, as some bond coupons were found
in his possession.

THE HAGUE, Sept. 25.-A correspond

made in the Solr or Brussels that Kruger
has directed to send a special mission to
President Roosevelt is not correct. It ap
pears that Â»uch a project had been in
contemplation, but the idea is not likely
to be carried out, owing to the great ex

LOX1X)2C. Sept- 24. â The announced re
tirement of William C. Whitney from the
English turf occasions regret, but hardly
surprises those who have noted the recent
trend of events. There is a widecpreÂ«d
feeling that beaind Whitney's published
reasons for his withdrawal is the realiza
tion of the fact that the attitude of the
British turf authorities toward Americans
is no longer marked by the absolute im
partiality which characterized their con
duct prior to tho pre-eminence of Ameri
can owners, horses, trainers and Jockeys.
During the recent season complaints have
been frequent that the American horses
were too heavily handicapped, that the
Jockeys were harshly treated and that In
terferences during the races were white
washed, which would not have been tol
erated on the part of American judges.
It will cause no surprise if other Ameri
cans of Whitney's class follow his exam
ple, which, it is noted, came closely after
the receipt of a detailed report of the
treatment accorded to Volodyovsky in the
St. Leger.
The Dally Telegraph remarks that
\\ hitney's decision must . have ! been
reached very suddenly, seeing that only
on September 17 Whitney nominated year
lings for the races of 1904 and 1903. The
Telegraph adds:
"Some American owners have not made
themselves acceptable to this country
but Mr. Whitney la one of the exceptions
that go to provÂ«i the rule.''
The Sportsman Bays: "His retirement
will be received with regret by all British
eportsmen."
Whitney's action appears to have taken
Huggine, his trainer, by surprise.

At 4 o'clock the work on the Columbia

before morning. Sir Thomas took it all

A N defender Columbia were made
publfrc to-night at the New .York
Yacht Club. The result was in the nature
of a surprise, for it showed that the
Shamrock II, which is the larger boat so
far as sail area*and displacement are con
cerned, allows only forty-three seconds
to the Columbia over the thirty-mile
course on which the contests for the
America's cup are to be sailed. >
The Shamrock has a shorter water-line
length. She has a longer spinnaker boom,
a longer topmast, a longer gaff and car
ries more canvas. Watson, the designer
of the Shamrock II, by keeping down the
load water line length of his yacht, has
got the better of his rival, Herreshoff.
The sail area of the Shamrock is larger
and by judicious handling of his spars
Watson is only penalized forty-three sec

There was no diminution in the attend
ance at Oakland track yesterday and coin
seemed plentiful In the ring, although It
was not bet in $10,000 chunks. J. Ransch,
the Burns & WaWhouse . lightweight,
again ran away with the saddle honors,
landing first in succession on Alicia, Matt
Hogan and Parizade, favorites with the
exception of the Hogan horse, which was
quoted at 7 to 2. El Rey, another short
priced choice, arrived on time, but Pega
long dropped in at 7 to 1. â¢
' Only Dan W, Alta Vela and Boydello
started in the 2:14 trot. The track was
slew and lumpy and it proved a tame af
fair. Boydello made a mistake soon after
the trio received the word in the opening
heat and was distanced. Alta Vela, driven
by S. A. Hooper and favorite in the books,
then defeated the roan horse in three
straight heats.
D. p. Fountain purchased Pegalong
from J. D. Dunn In the morning and the
brown gelding took the first run at odds
of 7 to 1 for his new owner. Making the
pace almost from the start, he downed
Billy Moore half a length, driving. The
favorite, Mamie Hildretn, ran third. Nel
lie Forest received considerable backing
at 3 to 2, but apparently had not recov
ered from her car ride across the conti
nent.
While the barns were reported full of
three-year-old maidens, but five started
in the five-furlong dash. El Rey, with
Gouin up and an even money chance,
shook off Luca in the stretch, winning by
a length. Peut Etre took the show.
In the mile and a sixteenth selling
event Alicia, the 4 to 5 choice, and Lizzella
next in demand, fought it out the last
eighth of a mile. Hand ridden only by
Ransch, the favorite reached home first
by a neck. J. T. Woods on Lost Girl ran
third.
"Bill5 r " Magrane, whose horses only ar
rived here last Saturday, started in the
California campaign well by capturing the
five and a half furlong handicap with
Matt Hogan. Carrying 117 pounds, Matt
overhauled and passed First Shot in -the
stretcn, scoring in a hard drive by half ;i
length. Ruiz rode Etta H, the 7 to 10 fa
vorite, finishing away back in the corn
field.
All of the other starters in the two
year-old handicap got what Parizade left.
A 4 to 5 favorite, the St. Carlo filly lost
her company, disposing of Louwelsea and
Evea G by nve open lengths.
Kid Johnson, a former pupil In Alex
Oreggains' school for fighters, fought
"Jack" Granfield, . who outweighed him
fifteen pounds. Johnson was to fight
Arthur Granfleld, who could not appear
owing to an Injured arm. The bout went
the limit, the judges deciding in favor
of Granfield on points. Frank Sweeney
refereed both preliminaries.
Louis Long and Kid Chinner boxed the
first preliminary. It was scheduled for
tea rounds, but Long won In the eighth,
knocking Chinner out Long secured a
lead in the fifth round which his op
ponent could not overcome. A right to
the Jaw put Chinner out and he did not
come to for some minutes.
Preliminary Bouts.
Gus Ruhlin, who was present, said he
never saw Jeffries perform so well before
and he has been present at all his cham
pionship fight*. He usually approaches
an opponent slowly, but last night he
walked briskly up to Kennedy each time
and exchanged blow for blow.
Jeffries was seconded by Billy Delano*.
r>e\Vitt Van Court and Jack Jeffries. Ken
nedy had the services of Frank Skuce and
two others.
E. J. Smith was referee. His duties
were not onerous. The attendance was
disappointing, the gymnasium being hard
ly more than half full.
Kennedy was said to be more than
thirty .pounds above his normal fighting
weight, but he did not show it. He had
evidently trained as well as the limited
time at his disposal would allow, but he
could not wlthst^id Jeffries' onslaughts.
It 'seemed nothing human could stop
Jeffries. He was as lithe and as active
as a cat, and having satisfied himself
that Kennedy could not hurt him he look
chances he wonld not dare take with
Ruhlin and others in his class.
Condition of the Men.
In the seeend round Jeffries was after
Kennedy like a bear, giving him no rest.
As they came . together both jabbed and
then clinched. Jeffries tried a left to the
face, which sent Kennedy's head back.
Jeffries then landed three times on the
body and missed a vicious right to the
head. Kennedy came back with a left to
the face. In a clinch he slipped down,
but was up without an instant's delay.
He was still fresh and full of fight when
Jeffries landed the left jab which sent
him down and out.
Kennedy said before he entered the ring
that he would keep away from the big
fellow for two rounds and would then mix
things. He cast this good resolution to
the wind as soon as he put up his fists.
He became the aggressor. At the first
attempt he landed flush on Jeffries'
mouth. As they came together each time
Kennedy was the first to lead and usually
landed, but received Jeffries' right on the
ribs in return. Jeffries landed a right an'i
left on tlie head toward the middle of
the first round and followed It with right
and left to the body. Kennedy jolted him
on the face and then threw his right to
the body. He followed this with a light
left and then right to the face. It was
grive and take for the remainder of the
round, the pace being exceptionally fast
and the hitting of the cleanest kind.
Tremendous Force of the Blow.
. Behind the blow was the full weight of
Jeffries' body, which gave it its tremen
dous effectiveness.
The knockout blow was a wonderful
one. It was give and take for two min
utes of the second round, when for an in
stant the vulnerable point of Kennedy's
chin was exposed. Jeftries saw his oppor
tunity. His left glove hardly traveled
three inches when it came in contact with
Kennedy's chin. Kennedy was lifted
clean off the floor and fell half outside
the ropes. Â¦ He was completely out while
the ten seconds were tolled on* and had to
be assisted to his corner.
The crouching attitude was cast aside
and he stood up, advancing quickly, irre
sistibly â¢ upon his opponent. Kennedy
landed four ha id blows on Jeffries' head
in the first round, but the champion did
not seem to mind them. He kept coming
ail the time ana for every blow he re
ceived he landed two. His favorite was
a right to the tody, each time just before
they clinched. This seemed propelled as
if by the force of a battering ram and
looked as though it would go through
Kennjedy..'
Jeffries was in superb physical condition
and fought throughout like a champion.
Kennedy proved a great surprise to all
the spectators. He stood his ground and
gave blow for blow. In fact, he was the
aggressor for the greater part, of the
fight. The pity of it was there was no
steam behind the blows he landed, and
when Jeffries learned there was no sting
in them he. changed his style of fighting
at once. ..""".-.
A championship fight In miniature was
the battle between Jeffries and Kennedy
last night in the Reliance Club ring, Oak
land. From the sound of the gong which
sent the men together in the first round
until the end came unexpectedly in the
second round it was one of the prettiest
exhibitions of boxing ever seen here.

Special Officer Rescues Him From a
Gang of Strikers.
Harry Edwards, a union lronnioldcr,
who resides at iO9 Waller street, returned
to work at the TTnicn Iron Works in order
to prevent his family from starving, and
Friday night a number of strikers waylaid
him on Walier street and administered to
him a beating- which will Incapacitate him
from working for a number of weeks. The
strikers, whp were four in number, beat
him about the head and severely injured
his left kree. Only the arrival of a spe- <
cial officer prevented the assailants from
inflicting permanent injuries.
Edwards is or.e of the twenty-one iron
molders who went back to work at the
Union Iron Works. In order that he
might not be molested by the strikers a
special officer was detailed to escort him
to and from his home. On Friday night
the special escorted him as far as the
corner of Waller and Webster streets,
and as there was no one in sight and no
reason to suspect danger Edwards was
left to go the rest of the way by him
self. He had scarcely gone a half-block

NEW LINE TO DAWSON
Last evening ho attended a ; birthday
party given at the home of Miss Powell
and while left alone with the girl a mo
ment shot and killed her and fled. As
soon as the students of the school learned
of the tragedy they armed themselves
and started In search of Croswell.
Croswell was surrounded by a posse at
11:15 to-night. Before he could be taken
he shot himself; dying almost instantly.
He was found in a barn near the scene of
the crime, where he had been in hiding
since the murder.
Miss Powell was a daughter of the late
W. J. Powell, editor of the New Era of
Rclla. She lived with her mother, and
because of her beauty and personality was
a great favorite wherever known. Both
Mrs. Powell and her daughter did all they
could to dissuade Croswell from paying
his unwelcome attentions, but without
avail. - â¢ â¢ ,
. J. S. Croswell came from Boston, Mass.,
where he graduated from the Institute of
Technology. \ All of last year he paid de
voted attention to Miss Powell and was a
constant caller at the home of the young
lady.
ROLLA, Mo., Sept. 24.-Last night at 11
o'clock J. S. Croswell, an instructor at
the School of Mines and Metallurgy, shot
Miss Mollie . Bowell of this city through
the heart and'killed her almost instantly.
The motive for the crime was jealousy.
Since the capture of the rebel strong
hold and the dispersing of the forces op
posing the Government there has not been
quite as much activity, but the rebels have

'They have been beaten, but they have
I not surrendered. Reports that all of the
rebels at Old Bank, a suburb of Bocas,
were either killed or taken prisoner turns
out to be a mistake. Many, of them es
caped In canoes and reached the main
land. They are commanded by Americans
and half-breeds and are exceptionally
well armed. They get their arms from so
called neutral ports, such as Port Limon.
Many of the rebels escaped after the
fight on Old Bank and are now at large.
The people of Bocas fear they will return
and do some damage. There is the usual
number of assassinations. Both sides are
anxious to foreign commerce be
cause both sides are afraid of a conflict
with any first-class power. The cause of
the revolution is steadily losing ground.
Government troops are in possession of
the Custom-house and harbor and are
administering the affairs of all lagoons in
the vicinity of Bocas. The killed in recent
engagments were forty-five on the rebel
side and two on the Government side.
Thirty rebels were taken prisoners, and
while trying to escape were killed.
NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 24.-The rebels
were not so badly repulsed at Bocas del
Toro, in Colombia, as reported. There
has been some looting on the part of
troops of the Government, but this ha3
been confined to places of Chinese mer
chants and was started on the theory
that the Chinese merchants were sympa
thizing with the rebels and had contrib
uted to their support.
The real estate confiscated Is situated
in New Tork City and Orange, N. J. It
was originally purchased by-Carter and
transferred to his uncle. . The same stt?p3
taken to secure possession of the money
at Huntington were pursued with respect
to the real estate. The securities held in
Chicago are in the name of another of
Carter's relatives. . It is believed that
there will not be any difficulty' in the way
of its confiscation. Other points where
it is believed Carter placed the money he
embezzled, the Department of Justice is
unwilling to reveal, but confidence Is ex
pressed by the officials that they will re
cover a large portion of the amount sto

As a result of the discovery that the
relatives of Carter have held and are
holding money which he embezzled, tho
â¢department is considering the advisability
of prosecuting them as receivers of stol?n
goods. Carter is now in the penitentiary
at Fort Leavenworth. The officials say
that if there was ever any doubt of- his
guilt the fact that his relatives held* the
money embezzled ought to dispose of the
last vestige of belief In his innocence*
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 24.â Two
hundred thousand dollars In cash, and
real estate valued at many thousands of
dollars, held by relatives of former Cap
tain Oberlln M. Carter, have been seized
by the Government. Securities worth sev
eral hundred thousands of dollars, dis
covered hidden In Chicago, are on the
point of being confiscated.
Thus, as the result of the activity of
the Department of Justice, the Govern
ment is gradually recovering a consider
able portion of the money stolen by Car
ter when an engineer ofilcer in charge of
the river and harbor improvements at Sa
vannah, Georgia. The department is not
certain that It will recover the entire
amount embezzledâ $2,100,000â but it has
clews which may establish where the
money was placed before detection came,
and these will be sharply followed.
Because of its desire to get possession
of as much of the money stolen by Carter
as possible, the Department of Justice has
been reticent regarding the steps it has
taken. It was learned to-day, however,
that $200,000 had just been seized at Hunt
ington, W. Va. This money, it appears,
was in a safe deposit vault In the name
of a brother of the former engineer offi
cer. To this brother Carter had trans
ferred securities, and at a convenient mo
ment they were disposed of in New* York,
gold notes being accepted in exchange.
These notes were placed in a safe deposit
vault at Huntinglon. Learning of the
whereabouts of the money the Depart
ment of Justice secured a judicial order
under which the seizure occurred.

V VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 24.-
Six union men from San Fran
cisco were put In irons for dis
orderly conduct on the trip up
of the steamer Walla Walla,
which 1 arrived here to-day.
The trouble began when the steamer
was one day out. The .men began to
bully the members of the non-union crew
and became so persistent after drinking
freely that Captain Hall remonstrated
with them. Then they abused the ofll
cers and captain and after giving them
time to consider his threats the captain
put them In Irons and let them stay
until they had sobered up. Next morn
ing they were released and half an hour
later were engaged in lighting the non
union men of the crow, l who got the test
of the engagement. The belligerent sall
nnÂ» were put In Irons a second time and
remained so until the end of the trip.
"It's all a mistake," he paid. "I mistook
the gentleman for u non-union man."
McMahon was charged with batteryi
Klvor swearing to the complaint.
from Seattle. He was walking along the
water front in the direction of the ferry
depot when McMahon stepped up' to him
and without a question or word of warn
ing struck him a violent blow on the
mouth, knocklnr him down. Policeman
O. H. Knight witnessed the assault and
promptly urrested McMahon. At the har
bor police elation McMahon said he was
sorry he had struck Kiver.
7 HE Iron Trades Council has consented to the ironmoldcrs making the best terms possible zvith
their former employers. In consequence nineteen molders returned to zuork yesterday under a

Paris is suffering from a pearl famine;
the pearl necklace has become so fashion
able" that pearls "are fetching & enormous
prices.' In relation to this famine it would
be interesting to' know what has become
of Liriheaus' recipe for the manufacture
of pearls. That philosopher, in the year
1761, informed Â¦ the then King ; of . Sweden
that he had discovered a method. by which
mussels might be made to produce pearls
and offered to "disclose it for .the" benefit
of Â¦ the . country. Bechman says . he saw
some of the pearls produced. Â£ The offer
not being accepted, Linnaeus subsequently
"disposed of the secret for a sum of money
to Bagge of Gothenberg. In 17S0 the heirs
to Linnaeus were desirous of selling the
sealed recipe* to' the" highest bidder and
it has; been said. that the secret Is in the
possession of a London merchant. .

KIT-CAT CLUBâ Sub., City. The Klt-
Cat Club was formed in Lomlon in 16S3 by
the leading Whigs of the day. It held its
meetings in the house of a pastry cook
named Christopher Cat, who for short
was called Kit-Cat.. He supplied the club
with mutton pies and in gratitude its
members named the club for him. The
club was of a political character and its
meeting place was "looked upon as the
headquarters of the friends of King Wil
liam. On its membership roll were the
names of Addison, Steele. Walpole, Marl
borough, Congreve, Lord Stanhope and
a famous painter, Sir Godfrey Kneller,
who- painted the portraits of the mem
bers of uniform dimension to adorn tho
walls of the clubroom. The particular
size has ever since beitn known as the
kit-cat. The society was dissolved in
1720. ' â¢Â¦ r; ':'-"^-
At last we have learned In whose hands
is lodged supreme authority. Last Friday
a British sailor was beaten while ashore
in San Francisco, because he was assist
ing in unloading his ship at the Wharf.
The strikers beat him, of course. The
leaders of the strike sent word to the
captain that whenever he wanted any of
his crew to go ashore he would please in
form the strike leaders and they would
furnish a guard. "You blawsted idiots,"
quoth the skipper. Then he appealed to
the British Consul. The captain bad no
doubt heard of a thousand incidents of
men being beaten nearly to death by
gangs of strikers, and ho had no doubt
seen arms in slings, eyes blackened, heads
tied up, and had heard of eyes gouged out,
ribs broken, and many other cruel deeds
by the cowardly and criminal gangs train
ing under "union" badgos. And the lead
ers of these cowardly brutes in human
form offer to furnish a guard for men
who have the right under treaty to the
protection of the United States Govern
ment in every port of the nation. The
strikers have acted all along as though
all power was in their hands, and now
they express the thought of their heart
by. assuming to perform the function of
the United States Government. "We will
furnish your men a guard!" The Mayor
has proved' himself powerless or unwilling
to cope with conditions. , existing in his
city. The Governor has spent three weeks
traversing the streets of the dirtiest city
in' America, and has been' totally blind to
surroundings calling "for .the exercise of
his authority. Then Mr. Furuseth, the
leader of fifteen hundred striking sailors
ânine hundred of whom are, he sax3, for
eignersâsteps forward and offers the pro
tection that neither the Mayor of San
Francisco nor the. Governor of California
can give^-or, if they can, they do not give.
The British captain has sailed the -ocean
too many, years to accept such guardians
for himself or his men. If San Francisco
Is not under the heel of anarchy, it is
dangerously near it. â¢ Â¦

PARK COMMISSIONERSâ R.. Chiles,

Park, will reach them.
FROM the tone of the utterances of Mayor
Phclan at recent conferences- on the subject of
the disorders that prevail in the city it appears
the Mayor has at last awakened to a sense of his offi
cial responsibility, and that he will hereafter cor
dially co-operate with the police in their efforts to
preserve the peace and protect citizens from violence.
Surely it is time that he did so. Should he now act
never so resolutely no one could accuse him of being
over urgent in the matter. He has waited until to
wait longer would be something like participation in
lawlessness.
It has been charged by the Examiner and by the
Rev. Peter C. Vorkc that The Call has exaggerated
the number and the nature of the assaults committed
by ruffian* upon peaceable workingmen in thii city,
The reply to that charge was made effectively by The
Call yesterday when it published a list of persons
taken to the public hospitals of the city suffering
from injuries inflicted by these lawless and violent
gangs. The list included only the names of those
who are known to have received their injuries at the
hands of strikers. It did not include the name of any
person assaulted but not eo badly hurt as to require
treatment at the hospitals, nor the name of any one
whose wounds and injuries were treated in his own
home, or in the home of a friend. Yet that list, matte
up solely of victims of violence cared for at the hos
pitals, contains 160 names.
/ Many of the cases cited show such serious injuries
as to prove that the ruffians who inflicted them were
reckless of the consequences of their action and would
not have stopped short of murder had the victim
been capable of resistance. In fact two men have
already dic^d from the effects of injuries received, and
others who may live will be lifelong sufferers from
the consequences of the beating, kicking and clubbing
to which they were subjected.
Among the weapons taken from the strikers by the
police are many that show a murderous malice and
hate on the part of those who made use of them.
They include slungshots and clubs and bludgeons of
various sorts, some fashioned of heavy billets of wood
and some of pieces cf gaspipe, steel cable, or other
material of similar kinds. It is to be noted, more
over, that many of the'-assailants were so vicious that
weapons of clubbing and beating could not sufficiently
satisfy their* hate. Such were in the gang that as
saulted Isaaac Rycrson of the Hcndy Machine
Works, and after beating him tried to blind him, and
mistaking a glass eye for his perfect one drove the
glass sphere into his head.
In the face of this cutbreak of violence the public
must discriminate. All the strikers have not taken
part in the assaults," nor do the members of the va
rious unions as a rule sympathize with the outrages.
The ruffians are but a minority of the people, and
have carried cut their lawless acts only because the
law lias not been sufficiently strong to cope with
- them. It is as well to point out also in this connec
* tion that the police have done as much as can be ex
pected of so small a force in so large a city. They
have acted with sufficient vigor to bring down upon
the Chief and many of the subordinates of the force
the attacks of the Examiner, and better proof of their
efficiency could hardly be given.
v At this juncture the law-abiding citizens of the
community will ask themselves what would be the
situation now had the Examiner. succeeded in getting
one of its tools appointed Chief of Police. It will be
remembered that the scheme came very near to suc
cess. With lawless ruffians assaulting citizens on
their way to and from work, and the compliant tool
of an anarchist yellow journal at the head of the police
force, order could hardly have been restored by any
thing less than a vigilance committee..
, From that danger. we have been spared. We have
a good police force, and i(_ the . Mayor will but :
strengthen it we shall soon put a stop to the ruffians.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
SINCE W. R. Hearst has begun making ex
planations to the American people he
should at once explain what he meant
by publishing in the Examiner of Febru
ary 4? 1900; this verse:
â¢'The bullet that pierced Goebel's chest
Cannot be found in all the West;
Good reason. It is speeding here
To stretch McKinley on his bier." .
EXPLANATION NEEDED.
PERSONAL MENTION,
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
ONE of the most remarkable photographs taken in re
cent times Is that of Chan \V. Hoey, a Chtheso elec
trician living in Bcheneetady. A short time ago he vis
ited the Pan-American Exposition with his camera.
There he took a night picture of the buildings while
they were brilliantly Illuminated with their incandescent lamps.
He forget to move the film.
A ihert time afterward hÂ« vlilted Niagara Falls and tqek
a trap shot of tha cataract. When the film was; developed hh
night picture of the uulldins* of the Pan-American Exposition,
was puperlmposed upon hlÂ» day picture of Ntaeara Fall*. Both
picture* were beautifully blended, Buffalo and Niagara com'
blncd. Above the graceful roofs of the exposition building*
grent volumes of water were tumbling down.
The officer* of the exposition regard this as ens of the moat
remarkable photographs ever taken.
From that list, including as it does almost every eminent legitimate journalin the
East, it will be. -seen- that in trying to sneak outof public wrath by setting up a newspaper
fight -the yellow anarchist has hardly benefited himself. â¢ There is no other man in Amer
ica, or probably in the world, whois regarded by^ the members of* his .own ' profession
with so much of abhorrence as is this man who has sought to degrade American, journal
ism to the slums and bring the profession of Franklin, Greeley, Bryant, Prentice and Dana
down to the level of Czolgosz. ' ' * â¢
WILLIAM. R. HEARST has sought to turn aside something at least of the pub
lic indignation against him. 'by the plea that those who- charge him with re
sponsibility in the crime of Czolgosz are business rivals who are trying to ben
efit themselves by injuring him.' In his organ, the Examiner of this city, he
directed that plea on Sunday, in a special measure against The Call, and will doubtless re
peat it in the hope that by iteration and reiteration a considerable number of the people
may be induced to believe it. It is therefore incumbent upon The Call to take note of it.
Hearst could hardly have conceived a more false but. at the same time a more
cunning plea. The public cares little or nothing about controversies between rival news
papers, and Hearst is aware that if he can so shift this issue as to* make it appear nothing
more than a questio.i between The Call and the Examiner, he will be able to sneak but of
the storm and escape the punishment which public condemnation has prepared for. him.
Let it then be noted that the charge of Hearst's responsibility for anarchy and for
crime has not been, made solely by The Call. On the contrary, it .was the spon
taneous outburst of public sentiment in all parts of the country. The intelligence of the
American people had noted the tendency of the teachings of the Hearst journals and had
long since condemned them. .In that condemnation/ however, there was a contemptuous
disbelief that the vicious teachings by pen and picture could result in an actual attempt
upon the life of the President who was daily vilified and maligned. The crime of C.7.0I
gosz startled the public by a disclosure that the Hearst papers were not so harmless as
public contempt had supposed them, and at once there arose tlie cry. of the public â
"Down with the anarchists, and down with the yellow journals."
That cry came from all classes of citizens. In many parts, of the country Hearst
was hanged in effigy as an evidence of the popular rage against him, and while the masses
were expressing themselves in that or other equally forcible ways eminent men were. pro :
nouncing the condemnation of Hearst in the most emphatic manner and under the most
solemn and impressive circumstances. â¢
. Among those whose charges Hearst # has to answer, and whom he cannot set aside
by the shuffling lie that they are business rivals, are: . Grover- Cleveland, Cardinal Gib
bons, Archbishop Riordan, Bishop Cranston of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Presi
dent Wheeler^of the University of California, President Jordan of Stanford, Vice President
Cooper of Rutgers, Abram Hewitt of New York, and almost every orator who spoke at
memorial services held at every important city in the Union on the day of the funeral, of
the President. .To these are to be added the host of other men who acted as the repre
sentatives of public institutions and organized bodies! such as the Chamber of Commerce
in this city and the State Board of Horticulture.
These men were^ not vague in their condemnation. Some of them, indeed, did not
name Hearst nor the yellow journals which he supports out of his wealth, but they made
their meaning so clear and plain that no one could mistake it. Others frankly spoke the
loathed names and specified that they meant- William R. Hearst and his three papers, the
New York Journal, the Chicago American and the San Francisco Exarrfincr. .
Does Hearst deem it possible that he can induce the American people, or even a
respectable minority of them, to believe that such men are his business rivals, or in any
He has threatened to retaliate upon those who condemn him. How will lie retali
ate? Will he burn in effigy all who have burned him in effigy? Will he slander every
man in America who has refused to take one of his papers? Will he hold up the eminent
men who have spoken against him and daily vilify them for the purpose of rousing
against them some wretch of the Czolgosz type?
Should Hearst, learning discretion from cowardice, hold fast to his scheme of mis
representing the issue to the public and insist that after all it is but a newspaper fight,
he will even then have his hands full when he undertakes the task of retaliation. It is not
in California only that he has been exposed and the' meaning of his vicious teachings made
clear by the press. He and his journals have been condemned in the East almost as uni
versally as in California. In the whole of this State he has had but one or two apolo
gists, and in proportion to the number of papers he is about as badly off in the.East.
It would require more space than we caii afford to publish the list of all Eastern
newspapers that have expressed-the popular condemnation of the yellow journals. Taking
only the more important papers and those only that have emphasized the criminal char
acter of the Hearst publications by repeatedly directing popular attention to it, we have
this long array: .

Tupper reports that the San' Francisco

lamps in the' downtown districts and on

some 1500 lamps to be erected, but the
work has been stopped by the Incan

the danger to which they may i be sub

In his monthly report filed yesterday
with the Board of Public Works ' Light

tion to the fact that the service pipes
leading to the gas lamps around the City
Hall are. In bad condition.- One pipe was
found to be fun. of holes for a distance of
twelve feet. Tunper says the waste of
gas is enormous. At his request he was
given authority by Colonel Mendell, presi

at an expense of $200.

"Word has just been received from Reno
that a plant of the Vulcan Smelting and
Refining Company of this city has been
put to a successful test at the Nevada
State Fair at Reno. The result has at
tracted the attention of the mining people
all over the. country, as this demonstra
tion at Reno has been looked forward to
by many mining people who are interested
in the success of the furnace, as it virtu
ally means * the revolutionizing of the
smelting industry on the coast.
The plant was erected in the State Fair
grounds under the supervision of the pres
ident of the company, Mr. Frank W.
Page, and- ru..s were made on different
kinds of refractory ores, including heavy
sulphide ores and copper carbonates, and
as a result turned out high grade copper
ingots, going as high as 88 per cent pure
copper and carrying the gold and silver
values.
The smelting industry is one which Is
rapidly coming to the front, and this ex
hibition run of the Vulcan Company has
proved conclusively the fact that a newer
and cheaper process for reducing ores,
especially refractory ores, has at last
been ascertained, that the old methods '
are .becoming obsolete, and that this
newer method bids fair to take the place
of the old style blast stack in the near
future.
The Vulcan Company have" a number of
standing orders for their new plants,. and
thia successful run at Reno will result In
placing their plants in the different min
ing camps throughout the country.

The enterprising management of the
Emporium and Golden Rule Bazaar gavp
a highly enjoyable theatrical treat to its
3200 or more employes at the Columbia
Theater last night. The entire house was
engaged for, the occasion, and 1400 invi
tations to employes and their friends
were issued. The bill was Rosenfeld's "A
Modern Crusoe," and its humor was thor
oughly enjoyed.
It is the custom of the Emporium man
agement to entertain its army "of assist
ants Â¦ annually.' Formerly sumptuous
banquets or dances were given, but this
year a thatrical entertainment, although
far more expensive, was decided upon.
The event was in the nature of a recep
tion to General Manager Henry Dem
ham and his wife, who have Just return
ed â¢ from Europe, and to Director â¢ and
Mrs. William Kaufmann, on their return
from abroad. The directors occupied the
boxes with their wives and friends, and
the rows back of the loges were occupied
by the flfty-two department managers of
the Emporium with their families and
friends. It was a fine-looking and appre
ciative audience, a fact which the players
did not fail to recognize. The general
public was denied admittance.
Among the directors in the boxes- were
M. H. Hecht, Henry Dernham, A. M.
Davis, H. M. Davis, William- Kaufmann,
F. Dohrjnann, A. B. C. Dohrmann, Super
intendent A. H. Martin and Advertising
Manager W. E. Joslyn. Arrangements for
a dance to be given next month are in
progress.

Schooner Maid, of Orleans Battles
: With Hurricane Off the Coast.
The schooner Maid of Orleans, which
arrived from Chignik Bay yesterday, had
a hard time of it on September IL She
left for San Francisco on September 4
with 7300 cases of salmon, and for a week
all was plain sailing. When in latitude 50
degrees north, longitude 146 degrees 13
minutes west, a heavy gale came up and
the vessel was almost thrown on her
beam ends. She was hove to under a
double reefed foresail, but even under
that canvas made heavy weather of it. A
sea was shipped that washed a lot of tur
pentine drums and several barrels of
salmon overboard. The gale increased In
violence and the reefed toresail was car
ried away. The schooner was finally got
before the gale and was driven miies out
of her course. Everything movable was
washed from the deck and the crew had a
hard time cf it. The lowest reading of the
barometer was 2S.68.

Troubles of the Eoyalist.
The British tramp steamship Royalist
was again released by the courts yester
day and will probably sail for England in
a few days should not another libel suit
arise. The vend came here under char
ter to a San Francisco firm and was then
recharteiec to Swayne. lioyt & Co. for a
voyage to Australia. She was guaranteed
to carry 5300 tons dead weight at a speed
of ten knots on a coal consumption of
twenty-six ton?. The voyage to Sydney
was made in twenty-live days, which sat
isfied the charterers, but she was forty
one days coming back. There had been
trouble aboard at Newcastle, Australia,
and a new crew was put In the engine
room and some repairs made.
Leaving Newcastle the Royalist had as
mucn coal in her bunkers as when she
left San Francisco, yet when thirty-one
days out it wa.s all gone and the steamer
was in midocean. '.Then the cargo was
broached, and ten days later the vessel
reached San Francisco, having burned
4 ( W tons cf coal in that time. On her ar
rival here the sub-charterers demanded
pay for the coal burned out of the cargo,
and also an allowance for the extra time
taken to reach this port. The owners
would not make any allowance, so the
Ehip was libeled and remained in the
hands of the United States Marshal for a
month.
In the meantime the original charterer
wanted the vessel for his unexpired term
and coaled her for her voyage. As soon
as she was released on the sub-charterers'
claim another plaster was put on for the
coal supplied and the loss of a month's
time. This demand was again combated
by the owners, and it ivas only yesterday
that the Royalist was released after be
ing in .port since July 4 last. She may
now be chartered to load wheat for Eng
land, to which place both suits against
her 'have been transferred.
South S?a Whalers Warned.
The wind-jammers that leave here for
a whaling cruise in the southern and
Okhotsk seas would better not call at the
Carolines' next spring. Last season one
of the barks put Into Kusaie and sold a
number of knives and other dangerous
weapons to the natives. This kind of
traffic is expressly forbidden by the Ger
man Government, and now a guard of
fifteen men under a petty officer is held In
readiness to punish any American whaler
that may put into the Carolines with the
Intention of trading. A Japanese schooner
caught in the act of illicit trading was
confiscated and her crew sent home on a
German gunboat. This is the news brought
by the trading brig: John D. Spreckels
from the south seas. The Spreckels left
here in May last, and after calling at
Gucm went to Ruk. At that point the
wreck of the German steamer Munchen
is high and dry on the beach. She was
a trader between Hongkong and Sydney,
touching: at all German possessions. She
went ashore Â£uring a gale and is now a
total loss.
The officers of the Spreckels say that
traders of ail nationalities except German
are being driven out of German posses
sions, and that the natives are growing
restless.
Arrival of the Sierra.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Sierra arrived from Australia, New Zea
land, Samoa ar.d Hawaii Jast evening too
late to pass the quarantine officer. She
will deck early this morning.

The Mayor issued a proclamation yes
terday calling for an election on Novem

The Election Commission met yester
day and denied the petition of the.- Social
ist Labor party for a place on the munici
pal ticket at the next election. The rea
son for this action was that out of 2779
names signed to the petition only 1342
were bona fide, the other 1437 not being
on the Great Register. It is necessary for
a political party to have 3 per cent of the
vote polled at the last election a3 signa
tures to a petition. This would require
1955 signers, and the Socialist Labor party
fell short of the requirements! by 613
names. The ticket of the party was
headed by Edwin K. Carpenter,- candidate
for Mayor.

After many Inquiries as to the proper
mode of voting under the preferential or

was begun. At midnight. the last ballots
had been cast and the judges proceeded
to count the votes.
The count of 271 votes was not completed

After. the candidates for Supervisors
had been presented to the convention Del

not eligible to the office, but declined to
state the reasons in public. . O'Neill from
the rear of the hall demanded that. Ryan
prove his charges, but after much whis
pering the matter was referred to the in
vestigating committee, which reported
that Ryan's charges were based on hear

Investigating Committee Reports.
Secretary Lane of the Investigating
committee presented the following report,
which, after. much debate, was adopted
by sections: v
-:"W. P. Flynn of the Stablemen's Union,
against whom charges were made at the
previous meeting, requested the. reading
of that portion of the minutes relating to
him. Flynn demanded that-the partywho
made the accusation against him Â¦ prove
his charges. Ryan of the Brotherhood of
Teamsters replied and said that the
charges made Â¦' had been . reported to - the
brotherhood ..by five pickets,: and. insisted
that ; inyrin's name be withdrawn from the
ticket. Flynn claimed that his action was
sustained by his union and the executive
officers of the l^abor Council. On Flynn's
motion -that - portion of the minutes re
lating to his case was expunged after the
reading of that portion of the report of
the investigating committee relating to
the objections made.
The Union Labor party last night un
dertook the nomination of eighteen'Su

names "submitted the previous night. The
"preferential" plan was used and ballot

DENTED PI*ACE ON TICKET
In the Democratic camp yesterday word
was given out that Joseph S. Tobin would
receive the nomination for Mayor. The
Tobin boom -was caused by a statement
that Mayor Phelan had positively, refused
to enter the race for another term. Demo
cratic leaders were of the opinion that
Phelan's decision was final and that he
could not be induced to go on thÂ« ticket.
In the Democratic Camp.
deem It advisable to hold another session
before Thursday evening and change the
report
There will be no lack of ar*>Â«Â£i.tion In
the proceedings of the conve'Â«Â«on. Aspir
ants for recognition who do not appear to
be slated, have active and inlluential
friends in various delegations. Harry
Baehr, W. Z. Tiffany and Frank McGow
an, for example, have many earnest sup
porters, who will demand that their
favorites be placed on the ticket. Baehr s
following is thought to be formidable
enough to command recognition. Politi
cians seem to think that Arthur G. Fisk,
the Examiner's Republican candidate for
District Attorney, will be nominated, but
it is noted that Frank McGowan is gain
ing in favor. He is developing so much
strength for the District Attorneyship
that Fisk's supporters are beginning to
inquire if McGowan did not recently es
tablish a residence in Marin County In
order to make himself eligible for Con
gressional nomination in the First Dis
trict.
The convention will meet to-night at
Metropolitan Temple, when it is hoped to
complete the ticket.

Greene's lecture 'on Art.
Francis Melbourne Greene's second lec
ture on art in the free course at present
being given by the. University of Califor
nia took place last evening in the audi
torium of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation. The lecture was subdivided
into design, color and composition, and a
very careful, and interesting dissection of
the stereopticon illustrations was' made
under these heads. : The audience was
shown the development of art through
its various stages up to the modern im
pressionist school,- the good and bad fea
tures of which were shown. - The lecturer
gave valuable instruction in the way of
how to understand works of art, and also
showed how to criticize what he termed
"playing at art," or making natural ef
fects subservient to designs made to play
extravagantly on the emotions. The
decadence of modern art came in for a
share of mention, and incidental thereto
the mention of "the kind of" pictures
young ladles paint on round plÂ§ques"
brought out laughter. The lecture was
well attended. , .*Â¦...<-Â¦.
The Republican convention's committee
on order of business, H. G. W. Dinkelspiel
chairman, held a session at the chair

Colonel George Stone, chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee and
commander of the California-Nevada de
partment of- the Grand Army, is home
again. He attended the national en
campment of the Grand Army at Cleve
land and was. selected as one of the com
rades to represent the encampment at the
funeral of President McKinley. Colonel

for the office < of Mayor, but his name

Colonel Stone Not a Candidate.
The impression is gained by general talk
with delegates that the contest for Mayor
is narrowed down to Charles A. Lau
meister arid Asa R. Wells, but the merits
of other, candidates may .be mentioned.
Tlie-fact that Wells was slated at a. re
cent conference held .. at Moso Gunst's
place of business has created much com
ment among the independents. At this
conference Max Goldberg, an ardent sup
porter of Wells, was authorized to speak
for Herrin and Burns. It is said that
many of the delegates who are opposed
to the programme and who object to out
side interference in the affairs of the con
vention have resolved to give their sup
port to Laumeister. There is talk of an
early caucus of independents to effect or
ganization for the purpose of breaking
the Goldberg 3late.

Resolved, That this, the regular meeting of
the Board of Police Commissioners of the city
and county of San Francisco, stand adjourned
without transaction of business out of respect
to our martyred President.
Whereas, The death of William McKlnley.
President of the United States, at the hands
of mi aesaRstn has plunged this, our country,
in deepest sorrow and mourning: and whereas,
it is fttttns and proper that we should rive
expression to our profound grief and sense of
bereavement. â¢ .
The board granted 124 permits to carry
concealed - weapons, and also the usual
number of -saloon, restaurant and ped
dlers' licenses.
The following resolution, passed at the
last meeting of the board, was ordered to
be placed on the minutes:
Policeman Buckley was granted a thirty
day extension of his leave iot absence.
He is at Hot Springs, Ark., suffering from
various ills. Ten special policemen were
appointed. They are: R. K. Hoft, P. L.
Clouse, D. H. Sewell, F. A. Stone. H. Dlss
ler, John Ryan, L. S. Walter, F. Morris
and William Roster.
The resignation of Policeman Â¦ E. L.
Knorp was read and accepted. Edward
W. Meredith, Frederick H. Flynn and
James Bruce were appointed to the force
from the head of the civil service list. .
Pedretti objected to the statements and
assaulted Patrizi when he met him In the
Italian quarter several days ago. The case
was aired in the Police Court, where Ped
retti was fined $20.
If the Italian editors of the city are not
soon fighting a duel it will be no fault of
the Police Commission. At last night's
meeting of the board Glovana Almagia
and Etteore Patrizi, editors of the 1/Ita
lia, were given permits to carry revolvers.
It appears that in their paper they at
tacked the editor, A. Pedretti, of La Voce
del Popolo, and declared tnat his paper
was anarchistic in its sentiments.

.CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 24.â President
Roosevelt has ample power to grant the
application of the Commercial Cable Com
pany for permission to lay a cable which
shall connect California, Hawaii and" the
Philippines.
This will be the opinion which the of
ficials of the Department of Justice will
render upon the papers, of the Commercial
Cable Company now before them. These
papers were referred to the department
by the Secretary of " State. Many officials
to-day say that there are strong prece

Commercial Cable Company's application.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24.â Secretaries
"Wilson and Gage, Attorney General Knox
and Postmaster General Smith were the
only members at to-day's Cabinet meeting.
The time was largely directed, upon the
request of President Roosevelt, to the ex
planation of the scope and character of
the work of the various departments.
Secretary Gage gave a- clear idea of the
present condition of the Treasury, i He ex
plained his reasons for purchasing bonds
for the sinking fund and quoted figures
to show that the saving to the Govern
ment by these purchases would be large.
Other members followed in â¢ the same
general line. The status of the reciprocity
treaties pending before Congress was dis
cussed, the President plainly indicating
that he believed strongly in the reciproci
ty principle. It was decided that the ap
pointments made by the late President,
where no commissions were issued owing
to his illness and death, should date from
the time President Roosevelt signed the
commissions. . â¢

Owing to the Strike,
A suit which was filed yesterday in the
"United States Circuit Court to j recover
55000 on a life insurance policy* made pay
tb!e to the wife of Louis G. Weisshaar^
who was drowned last year in Golovin
Bay, near Nome, recalls one of the sad
dest fatalities which ever occurred in that
vicinity and incidentally develops a pecu
liar tangle arising from the transferring
of the policy from one company to an
other. Â¦
Weisshaar was a prominent resident of
Mayfield until last year, when he went to
Nome to engage in mining. On Septem
ber 26, 1900. Weisshaar and twelve fellow
passengers who were being transported,
from the shore to the steamer Albion were
dumped into the mater by the overturn
ing of the boat. Only three or four of the
ill-fated gold-seekers escaped with their
lives. Attorney Harry M. Wright of this
city, who was one of the fortunate few to
get out of the Icy waters alive, is counsel
for Mrs. Weisshaar. The policy in ques
tion was originally issued by the Covenant
Mutual Life Insurance Company, which
became financially involved in 1900. The
Northwestern Life Assurance Company
of Illinois took up the insurance, and it
subsequently transferred the policy to the
Mutual Reserve Fund Life Insurance
Company, against which the suit is
brought.
- The company claims that during- thÂ©
various transfers the original policy be
came weighted with a $2000 debt The
plaintiff alleges in her complaint that
when the proofs of her husband's death
were first presented the company offered
to settle the full amount of the policy,
less some six hundred dollars.

The second measure, to deed all the in
stitute property to the city in trust for
certain library privileges in the proposed
new building, was lost by a vote of 197
to 17. . :
Before this property can pass into the
hands of the city several steps must be
taken. If the price set by the experts is
satisfactory to the Supervisors an ordi
nance will be passed and the measure
placed before the people for ratification
in the November election. If the people
vote for It another special election will
be called for December for a bond "issue
to cover the purchase price. This would
be accepted by the institute some time
before March In order to save the *60W
taxes on the property.
The Mayor and several Supervisors were
in attendance, all of whom were eager for
the passage of the resolution. Tne Pa
vilion site is wanted by the present Board
of Supervisors and Mayor Phelan for a
location for the library.

The members of the Mechanics' Insti

crowded the meeting room on the third
floor of the Post-street building to suf
focation. Two very important measures
were discussed, one the offering for sale
of the Pavilion site, the other the deeding
over to the city of all the institute prop
erties in trust. Â¦ The former measure was
passed, the latter ignominiously defeated.
After much ppeechmaking President S.
C. Irving called for a vote on the follow
ing resolution, which was all but unani
mously passed:

Sylva said, to-day that the assault was
an effort on the part, of the poolmen of
Sausalito to "put him out of commis

the Trustees' meeting to-night. Some time
ego Sylva let It be known that at to
night's meeting he would, introduce an or
dinance declaring the poolrooms a. nuis
ance and abolishing them. This greatly In
censed his one-time friends, the gamblers,
while the "hill crowd" was correspond
ingly jubilant. â¢
At a meeting of. the Trustees to-night
Sylva Introduced an ordinance calling for
the abolition of the poolrooms. It. was
voted down. Both the poolroom and the
anti-poolroom men pinned their faith upon
Trustee Crompton. The "antis" claimed
him because they electejl him and the
poolroom men because they had interest
ed him in their way of â¢ thinking. To
night Trustees Harms and Sylva voted
for the ordinance, while Trustee Thomas
voted against it. Trustees Nunes and
Crompton refused to vote and left* the
building. This defeated the ordinance.
Dr Crompton did not admit that he was
In favor of poolrooms, Ibut said that. as
the season lasted only a few weeks longer
he was willing to let the gamblers stay. â¢

trouble. The assault* upon Sylva last
night put the officers on the alert. Sher

he had" avoided the other four, went up
to the animal and shook a red capote In

hooked him in the leg, knocking him to
the ground. The maddened bull struck at

LOS ANGELES, Sept 24.â A special
nseetlng of the members of the Jonathan
Club was held to-day for the purpose of
adopting suitable resolutions on the death
of President McKinley. The Jonathan is
one of the two. leading social organiza
tiens in Los Angeles. Among the resolu
tions occurs the following, which is
avowedly aimed at the Hearst papers:
We join with our fellow countrymen in the
firm resolve that under our flag law and order
will drive out anarchy. We record our great
horror and supreme detestation of the foul
crime and the murderous teachings that pollute
the eweet air of liberty.
We condemn and despise those utterances of
the puttie press that tend to subvert the right
order of social existence, that villlfy our choseti
representatives, thereby infusing a contemptu
ous disregard ' for the laws that safeguard the
iniilvidv.nl rights of each and are the bulwark
of the home, society and government. And
be it further !
Resolved. That this organization discontinue
:ts .subscriptions. If any. to any public journal
guilty of the aforesaid utterances.
The resolutions were adopted. without a
dissenting voice. %

EEBTJKES THE HEARST PAPERS
MONTEREY. Sept. 24.â This community
Is somewhat exercised over two recent oc
currences in which gross disrespect was
shown to the memory of the late Presi
dent, and the feeling is so strong that
summary punishment probably.will.be vis
ited upon any one who commits a like
offense in the future. On the day of Pres
ident McKinley's burial a stranger whose
identity is not known walked up to a lo
cal barber, who was standing outside his
closed shop, and asked when the. shop
would be open, saying that he wanted to
be shaved. The barber told him the shop
would remain closed all day out of respect
to the late President, whereupon the man
exclaimed, "Oh, damn the late President!"
and walked off before any more could be
Eaid.
The second incident was the expulsion at
the point of a pistol of a man named
O'Connel, also a comparative stranger In
town, from a New Monterey saloon.
O'Connel made several remarks relative
to the late President " which were disre
spectful in the highest degree, and for
which the proprietor of the saloon called
him to account. Both O'Connel and the
man wishing a shave have disappeared,
and nothing is known here of their where
abouts.

OF THE LATE PRESIDENT
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 24.-Former
United States Senator Pettigrew of South
Dakota arrived hers to-day on his way to
inspect a group of mines near Yuma, in
which he is interested with Senators
Jones and Dorsey.
"Throughout the country the press and
the rveople are demanding that anarchy
be killed off," said Pettigrew; "that men
professing; anarchistic belief be expelled
from the country, and that none of sim
ilar belief shall be admitted. Drastic
measures are demanded, but without ex
ception no feasible plan has been pro
posed. Who is to define, and how is it
possible to define, the extreme limit of
radical faith that may be in a man to en
able him to pass the examiners at Castle
Garden?
"In this as in other matters history
ought to teach us something. Drastic
measures have always failed of the pur
pose designed. Anarchism is the effect
following a certain cause. Remove the
promoting cause and anarchy will cease.
This can be effectively done by passing
such good laws as will enable the com
petitive system again to hold sway in this
country, instead of continuing in the pres
ent groove of capitalistic concentration.
"The competitive system," continued
Senator Pettigrew, earnestly, "has been
the very basis of our national life, but the
present trust system can only ultimate in
a wholesale socialism. The aggregations
of capitalistic power are becoming so
great that the people will liven to the sit
uation and determine to administer these
great industries for the common benefit."

WOULD DEAL XENTENTLY
WITH THE ANAHCHISTS
The anarchists arrested to-night were
taken to Spokane. They were glad to go
and will pose as martyrs. James F.
Morton, publisher of Discontent, was dis
satisfied because he was not arrested.
A warrant was issued for John Morang,
another contributor to Discontent, who
resides in Boston. Authority may Be
wired to arrest him there.
Â¦ Just what Issue of the paper was taken
by the Grand Jury as a basis for Its in
dictments Is not known. The colony has
openly advocated the doctrine of free
love and these utterances are believed
to be the ones chiefly objected to. It is
known that tho action is taken with the
primary object of breaking up the home
colony. Judge Hanford has been very
pronounced In his expressed opinions that
anarchists should be squelched every
where.
TACOMA, Sept. 24.â Three members of
the colony of anarchists at the "home"
in this county were arrested to-day by
Deputy Marshal Crosby and Postofflce
Inspector Wetland, on a charge of send
ing obscene literature through the mails.
Tne warrants were Issued by Federal
Judge Hanford In Spokane and were
.based on indictments found by the Fed
eral .Grand Jury In Spokane on Saturday.
The men arrested are James Adams, a
printer employed on the anarchist organ
called Discontent, and Charles Govan
and Jamea Larkens. contributors to Dis
content.

In the meantime Captain Seeley, recog
nizing the accident as likely to lead to
an almost indefinite passage, cut the pas
sengers and crew down to two meals
a day and very light meals at that,
though the ship's stores were sufficient
for any reasonable length of time and
could have sustained all on > board for
thirty aays in a. pinch. A week had
elapsed after the accident before the seas
calmed sufficiently to permit of any at=
tempt to rig a temporary steering ap
paratus, the vessel during that time ly
ing in the trough of the heavy sea and
drifting before the gale. Two or three
days passed before the apparatus could
be made to answer the purpose because
of the wind and seas. During the whole
of her trip after the accident the Oregon
sighted only one other vessel, and that
bo far away that she did not see the
distress signals.
"We have had an eventful voyage,"
said one of the passengers. "It looked
at one time as though we would have a
pretty hard squeeze to get out of the
pickle we were in, with the bad break
down and heavy weather, but the Oregon
is certainly a fine sea boat, and we were
lucky all the way through, besides having
things excellently managed. Of course,
the short rations caused some distress
and a -little grumbling, but on the whole
everybody was with the captain In cut
ting down in case we were not picked up
for a long time. None cf us expected to
get in without help, as we all recognized
the difficulty of steering a grÂ«tft ship like
that without a rudder; and then some of
us felt pretty badly when we saw the
Empress leaving us to our fate.
"Most of the passengers behaved splen
didly, however, and in the darkest hours
of our eventful voyage put the best light
on the affair and 'jollied' as much as pos*
sible about our situation. We even had
a literary and musical entertainment in
the social hall while we were rolling help
lessly in the trough of big seas. As soon
as Captain Seeley got his jury rudder
fixed to suit him we came along all right,
and with every mile nearer home our ra
tions were increased until it seemed cer
tain we would get in, when we got back
to a good table and three meals a day,
with trimmings to fill up the still empty
corners of our anatomy."
The Oregon lost one passenger by death,
Dan O'Brien of Minnesota, who was
buried at cea.

The Oregon left Nome at 5 p. m. on

Special r Dispatch â¢ to The Call.
MONTEREY, Sept. 24.â The maniac who
has.roamed the wilds of the Sur section
of this county for the' past two years,
striking terror to the hearts of the timid
among the women and children and elud
ing capture by Sheriffs' posses and ranch
ers alike, . has once more been seen, this
time by : Philip Dolan, a wealthy rancher
of the- Sur district.'. Dolan describes his
encounter .with the "wild man" as fol
lows: Â¦ Â¦
â¢ "I was on my way to. the woods bick
of my house last "Wednesday, and, walk
ing through thick underbrush, had almost
reached a clearing, .when . my . attention
was attracted by strange sounds. I peered
through -the dense growth and saw on.
the 3 farther side of Â« the clearing a - . man
with' long, unkempt hair and beard and
his clothing in shreds. I crept cautiously
to -within. fifty yeards of him and had a
good view. of his features. He is a large
man, muscular .and fairly good-looking,
despite his Â¦ unkempt" appearance.' "" As
soon as he caught sight of me his eyes
grew wild, like those â¢ of a terrified animal,
and he started to run for the brush, I fol
lowing at the. top -of my. speed and shout
ing to him to stop and'that I would not
harm him. 'I do not know whether he un
derstood me or not. for he : paid " no/ atten
tion what I- said, but with
incredible speed into the underbrush."
; The- "wild; man," : as;h0v is- locally
known, has lived in* the wilds and sub
sisted, by petty pilfering ' Of- provisions
from the. adjacent ranch houses. -.He has
never, .been known to speak "to . a human
being.. He has been seen even as far north
"as the Carmel, but thus far his extraor
dinary fleetness . of foot has.: enabled him
to elude all "pursuit. - - >'-. ".. Â¦:
: It Is believed that he is "either a hope
less lunatic or a fugitive from justice. '

RHEUMATISM,
â¢There Is -a great deal" more suffering
from rheumatism than there need be.
Because skilled physicians are unable
to cure rheumatic and be-
cause some medicines advertfsed for
rheumatism, are ineffective, some peo-
ple think rheumatism is incurable.
-This is not so. - -
Rheumatism can be cured, but you
must take the right medicineâ a medi-
cine made to cure rheumatism by re-
moving pain and the cause of rheu-
matism. There 'is only one medicine
that effectively does this. It is Hal-
pruner's Rheumatism Cure. It is a
cure for rheumatism that acts quickly
and .lasts permanently.
It is a rheumatism cure that can . be
depended upon to do its work well.
Halpruner's Rheumatism Cure is
composed of oils, tinctures, etc. You
can take it internally and externally.
In fact, it is good to take both ways.
Rub it on to rub out the pain and take
it internally to stop the cause. It is a
medicine that will give you instant re-
.Hef'and a permanent cure. Don't con-
tinue to suffer, but send to your near-
est druggist for a bottle of this won-
derful â¢medicine. Don't let your drug-
gist give you anything else .either, for
there, is nothing that will do you so
much good, in such a short time as
/felpruner's
"Having suffered terribly -with muscular and
Inflammatory rheumatism for about eleven
years, and last January I had It 3 so bad I- -
could hardly walk. But -through . the advice
of my uncle I sent to Dr. Halpruner for some,
of his "Wonderful Rheumatism Medicine. He
sent me two one-dollar bottles, which I hava â¢
taken Internally, as per directions. My rheu-
matism has all disappeared and I feel thor-
oughly cured. My advice to any person who "
may be suffering, with rheumatism la to pur-
chase Dr. . .Hal miner's Wonderful Medicine

them. Yours respectfully,

LIKE OPIUM EATERS.
Coffee Drinkers Become Slaves.
"The experience, suffering and slavery
of some coffee drinkers would be almost
as Interesting as the famous 'Confessions
of an Opium Eater,' " says a Boston man,
W. J. Tuson, 121 W. Newton St. "For
fwenty years I used coffee at the break-
fast table, and. incidentally, through the
day I craved it as a whisky drinker longs
for his morning bracer. I knew perfectly
well thct it was slowly killing me, but I
could not relinquish it.
*'The effect on the nervous system was
finally alarming and my general health
greatly Impaired. I had dyspepsia, seri-
ous heart difficulty and insomnia. When
I would lie down I would almost suffocate.
My doctor assured me It was due to the
action of caffeine (which is the active
principle of coffee) on the heart.
""I persisted In Its use, however, and !
suffered along Just as drunkards do. One
day "Rhen I was feeling unusually de-
pressed a friend whom I met looked me
over and said: TCow, look here, old man,
I believe I know exactly what's the mat-
ter with you. Tou are a coffee fiend and
it's killing you. I want to tell you my
experience. I drank coffee and it ruined
my nerves, affected my heart and made
me a sallow, bilious old man, but through
a friend who had been similarly afflicted
I found a blessed relief and want to tell
you about It. Try Postum Food Coffee, a
grateful, delicious beverage, 'full of nour-
ishment, that will satisfy your taste for
coffee and feed your nervous system back
into health, rather than tear it down as
coffee hag been doing.'
"I took my friend's advice, and within
a week from that time my digestion
seemed perfect, I slept a irweet, refresh-
ing sleep all night, and my heart quit its
Quivering and Jumping. I have been
Vteadily gaining in Â¦ health and vitality
right along."

Is a- golden opportunity for holders of storage

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â The weather has

â¢week. Grain threshing and hay baling are
nearly ooiroi'.pted. Ucan harvest has commenced
in Ventura County; the yield Is excellent. Su
}-ar h'pts are being gathered; the yield Is ex

COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â The cool.
*oggy weather along the coast has been un
favorable lor fruit drying, and rain at the close
of the week has undoubtedly caused consider
able damage to grain in the sack, unbaled hay,
prai cs on the vines and beans. Ample warn
ings had been Riven and it is probable that dry
ing fruits and raisins on the trays were not se
riously injured. Frosts on the fth and 16th
Ferioasly damag-ed corn, potatoes and tomatoes
in portions of Sonoma County, and injured
hops, beans and tomatoes in the vicinity of
T'kiah. Hep picking is nearly completed. The
yi<Â»id is liclow average in some places, but the
quality iE excellent. Sugar beets are turning
out well in San Benito 'County. Grain thresh
ing ard hay baling are progressing. Prunes
are yielding better than expected in some
places. Apples are plentiful and of good
â¢luality. In Sonoma County the crop is the
best for several years.
SAN JOAQL'IN VALLEY.â The weather was
Â¦a-arm with cool nights the first part of the
week, and cool and somewhat cloudy the latter.
Raisin making and fruit drying have progressed
rapidly, and a good jx>rtion of the first crop of
raisin KTHpes is on the trays. Larse quantities
of groi*-s are being shipped, and the wineries
are in full operation. The grape crop exceeds
early estimates in many places and the quality
if goort. Deciduous fruit drying is nearly com
pletcii excfju the later varieties. The first rai-
F!ns of thf- season were marketed at Hanford
on the 20th. The prune crop is light, and the
ulive croi) lfss than last year. A good crop
nf nreet potatoes is being harvested. Most of
the rrain crop is stored in the warehouses,
nain besain to fall Monday morning, and will
cause a crcat amount of damage to grapes on
the vines, unprotected grain, and fruit on the
trays.
Grain threshing and hay baling are com
pleted in M>me sections and progressing rapidly
in others. Immense quantities of hay and grain
are exrmf-ed, and it is probable that the loss
will be serious, as the rain has been quite
general and in some sections unusually heavy,
over tup inch having fallen In three hours at
lied liluff. Beans and hops have also been
considerably injured. As ample warnings had
been given, it is believed the raisin-growers
and fruit-dryers stacked their trays, and that
the damage to these fruits will be comparative
ly lijjht. Grapes on the vines will undoubtedly
be Uadiy damaged. The yield of grapes is con
siderably better than anticipated a few weeks
apo. but is below average: the quality is ex
cellent. Apples are yielding a large crop, some
sections reporting: the heaviest yield for sev
eral years and of superior quality. Hops, beans
end sucar beets are vielding good crops.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â Warm weather
prevailed during the first of the week, changing
to cooler on the ISth. Rain commenced Satur
day night, continuing at intervals through
Eaadiy and to-day; at Red Bluff the rainfall
up to 5 o'clock this morning amounted to 1.36
inches. Grain, hay and grapes have probably
been considerably damaged. but as ample
warnings lir.d been given the damage to rai
fins and drying fruits will be light. The sec
or.3 crop of grapes is being gathered; the yield
if below average in some places. Oranges con
tinue in excellent condition and a good crop is
expected. The olive crop will be light.
GENERAL SUMMARY.â Nearly normal tem
perature prevailed during the first of the week,
followed by cooler weather, with heavy fogs
along the coast. Rain commenced Saturday
night in feme sections, continuing through Sun
day, and to-day showers are falling in all parts
o* the State.

of the climate and crop section of the Weather
Burcati. for the week ending Monday, is as

The Weather and Crops.
e&ye: The salmon market had been the scene
of a considerable Flump in prices caused by the
nws of an unusually heavy pack on the Fraser
River and Puset Sound. Prior to these advices
being received, the position was believed to be
a very healthy oneâ stocks on the spot were not
cxeetsive, arÂ»d while the demand was not alto
gether satis! actory, holders were very steady
and not at all inclined to force business by a
etrikintf reduction in rates. How great a fall
there has been can only be realized by the
statement of figures, and it is no exaggeration
to state that Fraser River came down no less
than 12s per ease from the hishest point touched
this year. Tlie recent fall in prices has caused
a considerably increased demand, and .consid
erable Quantities? have been moved off during
the part week at about the Fame basis of prices
as that ruling last week. The special packages
of salmon, such as squats, J ,~-lb ovals. Vi-lb
txllE ainu 1-Ib ovals, are scarce.

In Northern Nevada, there has been a rise in
temperature of from 8 to 18 degrees.
Sprinkles of rain are reported at Eureka and
at Salt Lake City.
Forecast made at San Francisco for thirty

Northern Californiaâ Fair in southern por
tion, cloudy, threatening weather in northern
portion and probably light showers in extreme
north; warmer; fresh southeasterly winds.
Southern Californiaâ Fair Wednesday; light
westerly winds.
Nevada â Fair Wednesday ; warmer: brisk
southerly winds.
the exact position of the low pressure over

southern half of the Pacific Coast there has
been a steady rise in pressure. Over Northern
Utah there has been a rise of .60 of an inch
during the past twenty-four hours." -
I The market stands precisely the same. There
Is less demand for shipment, but stocks of
everything are moderate, owing to the short
crops, and holders are firm and generally Indif
ferent about selling. At the same time,
enough fruit Is being bought in the country to
make a very respectable shipping movement,
and excepting Apples, no weaKness is appar
ent.

ALAMEDA, Sept. 24.-Since his connec
tion with the municipal "electric lighting'
plant began a month ago Julius Wittich,
the new collector for the plant, has dis
covered that twenty-four persons have
been receiving light from the city without
paying for it. Former Collector Thomas
H. Thompson says that he knew of these
charity subscribers, but that he did not
consider it any concern of his to try to
collect from them. â¢ .
Thompson was told that the new col- '
lector had discovered the names of twen- '
ty-four subscribers whose names are not
on the record books of the department
and that these people had been receiving
electric lights and currents from the city
to the amount of $270 without having
been asked to pay for it. . ' Â¦
"Yes," said Thompson In explanation.
"I knew that there were a number of
people getting light but no bills because
I was never officially notified by the me
chanical department â¢ of the plant that
they had been put in. It was, not any. of
my concern. The mechanic* of 'the de
partment aro responsible for much of the
loss that has been charged up to It: : They
did not. notify me whea they, made 1 con
nections. !',.-â¢;â¢:' . . â¢â¢ \ â¢ Â¦
"I. knew of one caso where a club vjiext
to a restaurant was furnished light with
out paying for it. When I discovered this
Htate of affairs I told them to shut It off.
but tho mechanics did not do so until
seventeen months Rftorward. There was
a casft where light was supplied to a
dark room from tho wire of a private con*
Burner. I know of othor cases."
Thompson : says that when he flnailv
severs his connection with the department
he will give tho City Trustees a month to
dlncover other free consumer*, Still he
does not think It Ih his duty to 'expose
them. Tho manifold beauties of the
mismanagement of the affairs of Ala"
meda's municipal light plant are thus
coming to llsht ono by ono. ,
The spectacle of a man trying to batter
out his brains by butting his head against
a stone wall at the comer of Fourth and
Oak streets attracted the attention of a

ken to the Receiving Hospital, where
from papers in his clothing his name was
ascertained to be C. ,H. James. In' his
pockets were found a check for $50 and
$20 in gold coin.* '
In reply to questions James would only
say that "it had to come." He is an in
ventor, single, and 46 years of age. He
was booked for insanity. Before he was
discovered he had battered his head bad
ly, and it was necessary to take several
stitches in his scalp and use bandages at

OMAHA, Sept. 24.-Chlef Engineer Ber
ry of tho Union Pacific has. reported . ad
versely on the proposition to build a cut
off across Salt Lake from Ogden to Lucln.
Tho Southern Pacific had made such
plans prior to Its absprptlon by the Har
riman syndicate, but since then further
investigation - of. the survey has been
made and some of- the dangerous features
of tho route developed. One of the great
est of these is the fact' that the Great
Salt Lake water level changes every few
years, and it is feared this would necessi
tate the building of an embankment to
protect the tracks.
Cut Off Will Not Be Built.

SEATTLE. Sept. 21.â Professor Miller
and W. C. Boyd, who have just returned
to Juneau from Cross Sound, tell a story
that -would indicate that the Indians of
Alaska need a little disciplining. These
gentlemen declare that the Alaska Indians
are as ferocious and bloodthirsty as the
Sioux ever were," and are held In check
only by fear.
Messrs. Miller and Boyd were working
several miles from their tent. One day,
on returning to camp, they found : that
the Indians had sot fire to their belong
ings, and their tent and "contents were
almost destroyed; The only thing that
saved them from suffering the pangs* of
hunger was that a part of their stores
had been cached some distance away from
the tent. These were saved. By sewing
together pieces, of burned blankets and
an old piece of sail cloth they got enough
bedding to protect them partly from the
cold and rain, and with the supplies from
the cache they finally made the homo
journey.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
ASSAILS A WALL
WITH HIS HEAD
"We propose to stop a 'lot of this an
archistic talk that has been going
around," said Colonel Wheeler to-day,
As a result of this attack upon the in
cendiary, Harter, the men engaged in it
and others determined to more effectively
organize. Several preliminary confer
ences have been held, and before the week
is over a general meeting of citizens will
take place. The men at the head of the
movement are Colonel Roswell G.
"Wheeler, Charles F. Fletter, D. W. Mar
tin, John A. Buchannan, Alonzo Bray,
David Hirschfeld,- H. R. Taylor, F. O.
Schuman and J. A. Collins.
Preliminary Conferences Held.
The idea of & law and order league is
the outgrowth of the disrespectful lan
guage toward the late President by an
avowed anarchist named Harter, living
at the western end of the city. Harter
declared to Colonel Roswell G. Wheeler,
former City Treasurer, that President Me-
Kinley was responsible for the killing of
the strikers at Coeur d'Alene and referred
to him as a murderer. It was proposed
by several men who overheard the con
versation to run the man out of town,
but when a committee of angry citizens
called at Harter's house they found that
he had fled.
of this city are preparing to or
ganize a law and order league for the sup
pression of all Incendiary utterances and
violent attacks upon the men who are
trying to make the wheels of Industry go
around. The .'men who are back of this
proposed organization expect that their
example will be followed by the citizens
In other places, and that It will have a
wholesome effect in reducing the disturb
ances that prevail in the State.

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 21â Following Is
the proposed contract formulated by ' the
committee on organization for the estab
lishment of the Cereal Growers' Associa
tion of California:
Under ordinary circumstances the Act
ing Secretary would refuse to consider
this method of securing Miss Stone's re?
lease and would demand th4j- the Bul
garian Government take action for her
rescue. This is not an ordinary circum
stance, however, and the department
officials fear that to pursue the usual
procedure would be to subject Miss Stone
to possible outrage and death. The rela
tives of Miss Stone will therefore be
asked to indicate the amount of money
they can afford to pay.
. It is possible that the department may
find an appropriation out of which funds
can be expended for this purpose, but
thi? is a remote possibility and the offi
cials say that as promptness is indis
pensable it will be wise for the woman s
relatives and friends to lose no time in
Etating what they propose to do.
When Miss Stone is released then the
State Department proposes to act. The
attention of the Turkish and Bulgarian
governments will be called to the outrage
perpetrated upon an American citizen.
They will be requested to see that the
brigands be immediately arrested and
punished. Claims for . indemnity will
also be submitted and pressed, so that
Miss Stone's relatives will probably be
reimbursed for any money they may ex
pend in effecting her release and the
young lady herself will be indemnified
for her sufferings.
LONDON, Sept. 25.â "Turkish troops,"
savs a dispatch to the Daily Telegraph
frcm Constantinople, "rushed the village
where it was supposed the brigands held
LIlss Ellen Stone, the abducted American
missionary, but they found it empty, the
brigands having gone into Bulgaria with
their captive."
Mr. Dickinson added that he had been
advised that the brigands were prepared
to release Miss Stone upon payment of
a ransom and they were awaiting a prop
osition from her relatives. The State De
partment Is trying to communicate with
the young woman's relatives to ascertain
what they are willing to give for her
liberation. â¢

W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â Miss Ellen
H. Stone, an American missionary, who

ADVEBTTSEMENTS.
Is the only -establishment of its kind
on the Pacific Coast. Its j scope is
much broader than that of the ordinary
optical store since it- includes an
Oculists' Department, supervised by
three eminent eye specialists. Its
rooms . are j fitted up as parlors, where
examinations can be . conducted with
suitable privacy and where perfect quiet
reigns. It is decidedly the most thor-
oughly, scientific and up-to-date optical
establishment west of Chicago. All ex-
aminations are perfectly free and every
one is made to feel at ease. Prices ex-
ceedingly reasonable.

i City; Attorney Lane filed Â¦ an Important
'opinion -yesterday regarding the proposed
issuance of bonds for the purchase of
library sites on ..which to erect public
library buildings , .for . ;which ; purpose t the
sum of $750,000 has been offered by An
drew Carnegie. . Lane outlines the method
of Â¦ procedure in the ; submission of the
question to , a vote of the people.- He says
that in case it is necessary to issue bonds
the question of their issuance cannot be
voted upon at the â¢ next general election,
but must be submitted ar. a special elec
tion to, be called ' for . that purpose. The
opinion says: ; Â¦ , \ Â¦
"If the land is to be purchased ! out of the tax
levy It Â¦ is necessary to submit - the ordinance
providing Â¦ for its purchase * to the I electors; . a
majority of the - vote cast upon the , ordinance
being sufficient to adopt it.-T'. Â¦- V
- If an ordinance Is , passed to purchase out- of
tax levy funds Â» the â¢ description - of â¢ the site
should be by metes \ and . bounds or lots and
blocks, according to . recorded I or . official maps.
The section is not as clear as It might be upon
this point, but. the , only safe 'way to proceed
would be to Â¦ designate the particular piece of
property . with Â¦ accuracy . in toe ordinance. Of
course, preliminary Â¦ measures | are not Â¦ required
to Â¦ be submitted to the electors and therefore
the board - could Â¦ proceed to investigate the
various sites available and obtain .valuations
or options thereon according to the usual meth
ods only the ordinance . to .1 purchase needing
for Its validity the ratification of the voter*.
â¢ If Â¦ the . several sites -for â¢ brunch libraries I to
'Â«Â«ther involve the expenditure of over $50,0C0,
it will be necessary, to. submit an ordinance for
thei- '. purchase -, to the electors. Each propo
sltlsn to a 1 ' proposed 'bond Issue must be voted
on separately, Â¦ as library situs, library, bund-
Ing, ' school . building,' : park extension , lands,
hospital, sewers. : ' ' ,

It is likely that Cooper will be prosecuted
on a charge of bigamy and the prosecu
tion is now preparing ' its case. Bertha
Young, 'one of the Australian victims of
the Impostor, is/in daily attendance at the
trial of Cooper and is prepared to; testify
that she was . married to the arch-de
ceiver. : Norine Schneider's Â¦ marriage ' to
Cooper will clearly - establish bigamy, and
if convicted Cooper can be sent to State's
prison for ten; years. A conviction on the
charge of forging a; telegram with intent
to, deceive and defraud Norine -Schneider
can be punished .with ten . years' penal
servitude. Cooper- plainly, shows by his
demeanor that he fears' a. long term of
imprisonment if convicted on account of
his prior sentence. .'77::, ,

A joint meeting of directors of the San
Francisco Board of Trade, the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association and
probably the Merchants' Exchange, the
State Board of Trade and the San Fran
cisco Produce Exchange will be held to
morrow forenoon at 10 o'clock in the
rooms of the Board of Trade, on Market
street, the leading purpose being to still
further express the disapproval of i the
business community of San Francisco of
the course of the Examiner. Conferences
took place yesterday â¢ between leading
business men at which the Examiner was
mentioned in very . uncomplimentary
terms. It was originally expected that
the several commercial organizations
would meet separately and that the San
Francisco Board of Trade would lead off
to-morrow with a special meeting of its
directors. Yesterday representatives of
other bodies asked to be included In - the
call for the meeting- which was sent out,
and this plan was adopted. ,
The Joint meeting to be held to-morrow
will be executive, but the resolutions
adopted will be given out afterward for
publication. The action of the San Fran
cisco Chamber of Commerce in excluding
the Examiner, from its rooms and in
structing its secretary not to give to the
Examiner or to its reporters any news
has been so generally commended by the
business . community that it is expected
the Joint conference wlil make a similar
move and also pledge the individual ac
tion of the several organizations. . The
Merchants' Association will consider its
attitude in this matter at a regular meet
ing to be held Friday morning.
.Father Shahan in speaking of the cru
sades pictured the condition of the various
countries of Europe : wnen .the armies
marched to the Holy Land, at the behest
of the Pope, to wrest the . eepulcher of
Christ from the hands of the, infidel. He
described the vast 'hosts of nobles and
soldiers who bore the red cross on their
breasts as a sigh of . fealty to the . vows
they, had taken. : Â¦ .1-
The struggle between the Christian hosts
and the Moslems was described In inter
esting detail, and the speaker told of the
millions of men who fell in the cause. He
also dwelt ' upon the quarrels of the ' Cru
saders that defeated the praiseworthy aim
of .those who had roused all Christendom
to arms for. the rescue of the Holy Land.
. The I distinguished - speaker reviewed the
formation of the Knights of St.' John, the
Knights ' of the Temple or Templars â¢ and
the .Teutonic Knights | after ! the : return of
the ' armies to Europe , from Palestine. * The
experience , gained In travel and" associa
tions by the ; Crusaders had Â¦ a Â¦ good effect
upon the populations j of Â¦ European Â¦ na
tions. Art, : literature, ; trades â¢> and com
merce were. fostered, and. the political re
sults of the | crusades Â¦'- were â¢ pronounced.
Many > lessons , had â¢ been . learned that
proved "most i beneficial, and gentle man
ners were introduced among the Â¦ people. Â¦'
In, closing his lecture â¢ Father Shahan
said that the crusades of the eleventh and
twelfth . centuries Â»: were the /political
schools of Europe and: that t the wars of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were

Judge Coffey made an order yesterday
directing the final distribution of 'the $1,
000,000 estate of John H. Baird, who died
November 12, 1880. >' Under the terms of
Balrd's will three-fourths of the estate,
consisting of eight blocks of land located
eouth of the park panhandle and embrac
ing a great many lots and parcels of land
in the neighborhood of |he Chutes, was
to be held in trust un^il his youngest
child, David Jennings Baird, became of
age. Baird named as trustees his wife,
Veronica Baird. Adam Grant and Eben
eier Scott. Grant resigned his trust a
ehort time after the will was filed for
probate.
At the time of the death of Baird his
family consisted of his wife, Marie V..
John Rush, Miles, Thomas and David J.
Baird. The last named child was but 3
months old, and until August 22, 1901, when
he became of age, the estate was held in
tact, except that certain portions were
sold to raise money to defray the cost of
street Improvements and for the main
tenance of the family. <
The property has greatly increased' in
value and at present is worth much more
than $1,000,000. The present * location of
the Chutes is part of the estate.
Marie V. Baird, the eldest of the heirs,
is the wife of Barry Baldwin, son of ex-
Unlted States Marshal Baldwin. David
Baird, whose coming of age has ended the
long trusteeshin of his mother and Scott,
was a private in the First California Reg
iment and saw service in' the Philippines,
as did also his brother Miles, who was a
private In the Fourteenth United States
Infantry. John Baird is at present study-
Ing law, having but recently returned
from a tour of the worlds

Â¦Dr. Maclean says -the operation was a
capital- one, and that only heroic meas
ures could have saved the patient's life.
. '.'Now that we have recovered the piece
el.- his collar,'.'., said Dr. Lamb,: "we are
anxious .to know, what became of the col
lar button. We made fe. search for it in
the wound, but could find to trace of it."
Forsstrom, though still suffering from
the- operation, Â¦ declares 'that he feels a
much different man. The physicians are
confident that within a month he.,will be
restored to good health. . " . ,
On the afternoon of October 23 last year
Forsstrom was riding a bicycle on Golden
Gate avenue near Larkin street. Just as
he crossed the latter thoroughfare he
crashed into a light buggy driven by H.
L. Jones, an employe of a local carpet
beating establishment. The shaft of the
tivggy penetrated - his chest, Just below
the neck, carrying everything with it. The
injured man was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and temporarily treated. Â¦
Ever since the accident the injured
man has been In. a precarious condition.
At times he was able to sit -up. but was
unable to do any work.. The wound re
fused to heal, and after a long course of
treatment the physicians determined that
some foreign . substance was resting on
Forsstrom' s heart. Drs. Lamb and Mac
lean-determined upon' an operation, and
on Monday the patient was placed on the
operating table. . Â¦
An incision was made in his chest, â¢ be
tween the third and fourth ribs, and the
course of the wound was followed. There
was much pus, and after the wound had
been cleaned the physicians found a piece
of the injured man's collar, about two
and a half Inches by one inch in size,
resting directly over his heart in the pleu
ral cavity. The young man had worn a
'"turn down" collar on the day of the ac
cident, and It was one end of this that
was forced into his body.. Some months
before a shred of the collar had forced
its way out.. .. - ...
After carrying: a large* piece of his shirt
collar In his body, Just over his heart, for
eleven months, Emlle.. Forsstrom Is ex
peilencing* relief. The annoying piece of
linen was removed . on Monday by Dr. D.
Maclean, assisted by Dr. F. T. Lamb.' .
