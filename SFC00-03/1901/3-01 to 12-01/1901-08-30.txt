he retires with, Hays is a matter of con

Wright;also .made a.', favorable impres

he displayed no angerâ in fact, he was
always ready, with advice and showed as
much interest in the welfare of the com
pany as when he was, in the eniploy^ of
the, Southern Pacific.
'.Wright's "resignation came like a cloud
burst over the* serene sky and railroad of
ficials trembled with fear, thinking that
they Â¦ .might ' all be : removed , one . by one.
But, as. was announced in The Call at

results now prove that he is much ben

Wright that he must keep out of polities'
or leave the company,: Wright answered
that he would still mingle In politics

then called for " Wright's . resignation,

.*" Staff Decreased in Portland.
Markham has been in * Portland for
many years In the capacity of assistant
freight and passenger manager. With
the consolidation of the Union Pacific
and Southern Pacific offices In that- city
the staff is to be materially diminished
on the first of September. It Is supposed'
thai it is on this account that Markham
was ' ordered '. to ' this â¢ city. "When will
Shepard get promoted?" is the question
thafis now going the rounds Shepard's
friends are numerous :in this city., and
yesterday they, did not : attempt to con-
ham is a relative of Stubbs through mar
riage, and that he is on this account
pushed ahead to the detriment of others.
Shepard refuses to talk about the ap
pointment of Markham, even to his in
timate friends. When they ask him
about it' he merely shrugs his shoulders
and says: "Well, I will have to make
the best of it." Shepard has grown gray
in .the -service of the Southern Pacific
and has been a most earnest worker. He
has always been one of the first at his
desk in the morning and one of-'the last
to leave at night. In fact, a few months
ago be .was taken 111 and yet refused to
leave his post. It wa3 only after Freight
Traffic Manager Sprbule ordered him to
go home and not to return for a week
that he would leave his arduous duties.
Shepard was picked out as a man who
was sure . of promotion in the near
future, and now that Markham has been
placed over him r there has been raised
a great cry cf disapproval. Markham
is; a, much younger man than Shepard
and has not - had half the j experience of
his I future subordinate. Shepard started
in as an office boy and knows the freight
traffic, or, .as- railroad men call it. 'â¢the

WICHITA. Kans., Aug. 29.â It is stated
here on reliable authority that the* Atchi

purchased the Kansas Southwestern Rail
way, which runs from Arkansas City to
Astoria, Kans., a distance of sixty miles.
It is said that the Santa Fe desire's- the
line to prevent opposition to its proposed
road from Arkansas City in a southeast
'ern direction to Fort Smith, Ark. The
deal is said to have been made at a meet-
Ing in President Rlpley's office In Chicago.
The Kansas Southwestern was built in 18S7
and was subsequently operated by the St.
Louis and San Francisco road. Five
years ago the "Frisco" abandoned the
line and it went into the hands of a re
ceiver. It Is said that the recent owners

DURANGO, Colo., Aug. . 29.â By the
turning over of the Pullman ,on thÂ»
westbound Rio Grande passenger train
at 11:18 this morning Mother Baptiste of
Denver. Mother Superior of Colorado,
was killed and Sister Mary Nora and
Harley McCoy, also of Denver, and
Pullman Conductor Whan were injured.
The accident occurred at Lobato side
track, about 100 yards from -the high
bridge, five miles east of Chama. Rail
road men and passengers alike" are un
able to explain why the car turned over,
as the time was slower than usual, the
track in good condition, and there was
no breakage before the accident. Tne
car was dragged about 75 feet. Mother
Baptiste was sitting on the left side and
the car turned , to the right. She was
thrown across the aisle and hair through
an open window, her head and noul
ders being dragged between the tJe_of
the^car and the ties. She was be
fore any one reached her. Her head was
split open. Sister Mary Nora is hurt in
ternally, and her injuries are quite seri
ous Harley McCoy was asleep when
Sfl'jar came. His arm slipped through
the window and his hand was ground off
at the wrist. Conductor Whan had his
'eft hip crushed and was also Internally
injured. W. D. .McDowell. State Health
Inspector, was aboard the train and
cared for the injured at Chama. He was
reinforced by Dr. D. R. Russell, who
came through to Durango.
Three brakemen jumped off a mile be
low Ellensburg, after trying in vain .to
stop the train 'with, hand brakes. Before
they could hurry back .to Ellensburg ar
rangements were perfected to send Â¦Â¦ in
pursuit of the runaway Â¦ train the fastest
engine in the Ellensburg roundhouse.
With a double locomotive crew. It was
quickly switched on the main line and
orders given to catch the, missing train
at all hazards. A speed of sixty miles an
hour was quickly attained and sustained
until the freight cars were overtaken at
Rosea, twenty-two miles beyond Ellens
burg. At this point a slight upgrade Was
encountered, which somewhat slackened
the momentum of the runaway train and
made it possible to couple an engine to it.
Soon after the train was brought, to a
standstill and flagmen were sent ahead to
warn approaching trains.
The train had been, switched out on the
main line at the Ellensburg yard prepara
tory to attaching to it a locomotive
which would haul it to Spokane. In some
unaccountable manner the train broke
loose and started down the grade toward
Yakima.
TACOMA, Aug. 29.â The most unique
instance of an entire train running away
ever known in .-the . Northwest : occurred
last night at Ellensburg, when, a heavily
laden freight train of thirty-nine cars got
beyond control and rushed down a moun
tain grade for twenty-two' miles at' a
speed of sixty miles an hour. By great
good luck no other train was met and not
the slightest damage resulted. Neverthe
less the railway men stand aghast at the
thought of the frightful accident which
would have resulted had the runaway,
train met another train or some other
obstacle. ' . i

NEGRO MURDERER
STILL AT LARGE
Their Efforts.
Pursuers Discouraged
Over the Failure of
Bloodhounds Trace Him to
Coal Mine, but There
Lose Their Scent.
HOLDEN. Mo. .Aug. 29.â "Boss!Â©" Fran
cis, the murderer of Miss Mary Hender
son of Columbus, Mo., on Tuesday even
ing, has thus far eluded his pursuers and
to-night the' largo posse that has been
searching for him partially disbanded, dis
couraged over the failure of their efforts,
after having been, as they supposed, at
the point of capturing the negro. A pack
cf bloodhounds were obtained to-day from
Manhattan. Kans., and taken to the Hy
att farm, the scene of the murder. They
found the trail of Francis readily and
followed it straight to the coal mine at
Black water, owned by a negro named
John Hardy, whose wife is an aunt Â¦ of
Francis. The posse, composed of 200 men,
felt cure that Francis was hidden in the
mine shaft, but as he was known to have
two pistols none of the men ventured to
go down. Finally A. W. Rice, owner of
the bloodhounds, entered the mine, tak
ing the dogs with him, but failed to find
Francis after a thorough search.
Late this afternoon Deputy Sheriff Tem
ple of Warrensburg called a council of
the posse, and after discussing the situa
tion the men decided to disperse for the
night, leaving a- few of their number on
guard at the important points. The search
will be continued to-morrow by a large
number of men.
Charles W. Hyatt, brother-in-law of the
murdered woman, will offer a reward for
the arrest or for the body of Francis, and
this is expected to stimulate the efforts
of the volunteers. â¢-,'â¢â¢â¢ :
Francis iÂ» known to all the negroes In
the county and is very popular among
them. No one supposes that he has gone
far from Columbus, and it is thought that
no negro in the neighborhood would re
fuse him food or shelter. There are sev
eral negro settlements in the district and
there are negro cabins everywhere. All
the Resrroes have been dlsarmd by the
volunteers and their houses searched.
There seems to be no doubt that Fran
cis first fled to his uncle's house at Black
water and then took refuge in the woods.
At this season of the year the vines and
weeds along the numerous creeks make
thick shelter.
The three negroes taken to Warrens
burg. 6uspected of having aided Francis
in his flight, are in no danger, the town
being entirely quiet to-night.

Bank and the Bank of New Amsterdam,
haa made a proposition to the board of
directors of the Telephone. Telegraph and
Cable Company of America, to purchase
that corporation outright for $2,000,000 in
cash. This is the only formidable rival
of the Bell Telephone Company. Confi
dential circulars announcing: ths offer
made by Morse were mailed to the stock
holders Of the company to-day. In which
the board of directors recommended the
acce'ptance of the offer, in view of the
fact that "a-la'rge number of stockholders
are " not willing . to advance additional
funds."
Morse represents himself only in the
proposition.
The company was incorporated with a
capital of . $30,000,000 under the laws of
New. Jersey on November 9. 1S39.
Since the offer of Morse, which was
made about ten days ago, the boards of
directors of the various subsidiary com
panies of the Telephone. Telegraph and
Cable Company of - America have held
meetings and approved of his proposition
and a day or two ago. the directors of the
present organization met, with the result
that the circular of to-day followed.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â The Division
of Insular Affairs of the War Department
to-day made public the annual report of
C. M. Cotterman,- director general of posts
in the Philippine Islands. While the gross
receipts from the postal service during the
last fiscal year showed an increase over
the preceding year, the expenses were in
creased to a considerably greater extent
than the receipts. The apparent de
ficiency is explained by a statement that
considerable amounts had to be expended
during the year on mall transportation
through foreign countries, the debt having
lapped over from the preceding year. Â¦
The number of regular postofflces in the
archipelago was Increased from nineteen
to. twenty-three. . Cotterman urges the
application of United States postage rates
to the islands. He comments upon the
irregularity . of interisland mail transpor
tation and recommends ' that authority be
given to advertise for bids for a' regular
service to all Important points in the
islands and that steamers awarded con
tracts be required by law to run on a set
schedule. &
The Expenses During the Past Fiscal
Year Considerably Exceed the
Receipts.

One Berlin paper has gone so far as to
describe the agreement of 1S97 as "an in
strument to keep Austria quiet while Rus
sia is engaged in Manchuria.' ' .
The idea underlying this warning ap
pears to be that Russia, having attained
her objects in. Eastern. Asia, is now
ready to pursue similar alms in the Bal
kans. \
Immediately after this visit articles ap
peared in the semi-official Hungarian pa
pers â articles believed In some quarters to
be inspired by Count Goluchowski â warm
ly protesting against Russia's intrigues in
the Balkans. These protests were based
on rumors that 'Russia was massing
troops onÂ»the Roumanian frontier and
sending torpedo-boats into the Killa. an
arm of the Danube;, and they plainly
warned Russia that, unless she faithfully
adheres to the Austro-Russian agreement
of 1897 to preserve the status quo in the
Balkans, Austria "wiil resume her liberty
of action." Â¦Â¦Â¦ " " ' . ..-v
LONDON, Aug. 30.â The Roumanian
Premier, M. Siltrzia, recently visited
Vienna, where he had long conferences
Â¦with Count v Goluchowski, the Austro-
Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, on
the situation in the Balkans. He conferred
with General von. Beck, chief of the Aus
tro-Hungarian general staff.
Warm Protests Made
Against Russia's In
' trigues.
C. F. Ressiguie, at present general su
perintendent of the entire Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe Railway, will con
tinue to maintain headquarters in Topeka
in charge of the Eastern grand division.
Mr. Hurley will be in charge of the "West
ern grand division, with headquarters at
La Junta, Colo. -Â¦"Â¦.Â¦-.
The supervision of General Superintend
ent Retslguie will extend over the main
line, and branch lines east of Newton,
Kan., and the main line south from New
ton to Purcell, I.T. General Superintendent
Hurley's supervision will be over the main
line and branch lines west of Newton, and
over the Panhandle division, which now
includes the Pecos Valley Railroad.
In deciding- to establish two grand di
visions, . the Santa Fe management is re
turning to the system that was in effect
for several years prior to 1896. In that
year H. U. Mudge, now general manager,
was made general superintendent of the
entire Atchison, TopelifL and Santa Fe
Railway, and Charles Ijyer, now general
superintendent of the Colorado and South
ern, who had been for some time general
superintendent of the Western grand di
vision of the Santa Fe, was reduced to a
division superintendent and the grand di
visions abolished.
J. E. Hurley, at present acting general
superintendent of the Santa Fe Pacific,
Southern California and San Joaquin Val
ley roads, the Santa Fe lines west of Albu
querque, will be the new general superin
tendent. The date of Mr. Hurley's ap
pointment, which will be simultaneous
with the division of the road, has not yet
been definitely decided on. It will be
either September 15 or October 15.
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railroad proper, that portion of the Santa
Fe system extending from Chicago td Al
buquerque, N. II., and Purcell, 'I. T., is to
be divided into two grand divisions and
operated under two general superintend
ents.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 29.â The
Times to-morrow will say:
Reports from all the mills of the cor
porations show that steady gains are
being made from the force of non-union
men. The strikers bay they Induced six
non-union men to desert the Star mills
to-day and shipped them back to Chi
cago, whence they came. On the other
hand. Superintendent Piper of the Star
plant announced that he is nearly ready
to start up the other mills in the plant,
and the men now waiting for the im
provements to be completed are in
the mill. In. the 'Painter mills
the work is progressing smoothly
and no desertions are reported.
New men are being secured, though the
CDmpany officials say that on Sundays
the strikers make an active canvass of
the homes of the men at- work and seek
to induce them to remain away from the
plant. The last two mills in- the Painter
plant were to have- been started to-day,
but it was found impossible to have
them ready, and the starting was post
poned for a few days. Pickets about the
Lindsay-McCutcheon plant In Allegheny
say they turned back a new man to-day
who was bound for the mills. Other
than this there were no changes in . the
Allegheny plant.
Another Mill Successfully Started.
The only significant action . In Law
renceville to-day was the successful
starting of the Guide mill In the Lower
Union mills of the Carnegie Company.
The start was made, according to the
officials, with a fun crew and the mill
will be run without interruption. Re
garding the rumor that the steel work
ers' strike would affect the opening of
the window glass - plants . this Â« fall, a
prominent manufacturer to-day said the
reason given for this was absurd. The
building trades, he said, have not been
affected by the strike In the least, as
was asserted. The structural steel mills
have not been stopped at any time and
buildings have been carried up without
interruption. If there is a delay in start
ing the glass factory fires, they say, it
will be from other causes. . .
There was little of interest about head
quarters of the Amalgamated Associa
tion to-day. The cause of the absence of
Assistant Secretary Tighe was intimated
In a report from Chicago, which sayn he
is engaged with Vice President : Davis
in organizing a new amalgamated lodge
In South Chicago, which will take the
place of the - one expelled by him two
weeks ago. It is said that fourteen,mem
bers have been secured for the new lodge
out of the membership of the former
lodge. . â¢ Â¦
The American Tin Plate Company has
announced that -It will start the Demm
ler mills of the company next Monday.
Police protection has -been asked from
Mayor Black of McKeesport.
Officials of the Amalgamated .Associa
tion will not discuss the report of In
junctions being â¢ served against their
members at Canal . Dover, Ohio, until
they hear officially from their district
officers. It Is â¢ believed by many of the
lay members of the association that
some effective way will be found by
which lnjuctlons can be circumvented.
But Few Desertions Are Reported.
mated officials, however, assert that their
ranks are unbroken and as strong as
ever. One of the steel officials said to
day that a general mistake was being
made regarding the time it would take
to train inexperienced men and make
them capable of operating mill machines.
This has been believed to be the case so
long that few have taken the trouble to
prove it otherwise. It is now determined,
he said, to have new men placed in po
sitions that will give them a chance to
learn the skilled work and many of the
men who held menial positions in the
union mills are to be taught skilled, work
with which -they are in a measure fa
miliar through long association with the
workings of the mills. It is confidently
asserted that before many months pass
it will be possible to produce many new
men and plenty to man all the plants that
are new Idle and which union men have
refused to take hold of. The strikers
say it will take years to accomplish this.

NOGALES, Ariz., Aug. 29.â The ex

this port began* this morning. He
was - called upon to answer, on
three charges â bribery, unlawfully permit
ting Chinese to . enter the United States
and conspiracy In connection with other
officials in permitting Chinese to enter
the United States unlawfully.
The last charge implicated the late Chi
nese Inspector Jossey of Tucson, who
committed suicide, or, as the local Coro'
ner's jury at Tucson said, "accidentally
killed himself." The complaint, j so far
as heard from sittings of the case, is one
of the most strikingly sensational that has
ever been known in official life in Ari
zona. ; â¢
â¢ The abrupt demise of Jossey,' the Chi
nese inspector, leaves a page out of the
history. It is a song of gayety ended at
one step in tragedy. What the outcome
will be is of vital importance, not only to
those directly interested, but in many
avenues of official life as regards the
Government.

! As to the exact cause of the explosion
nothing is yet known, but a rigid inves
tigation is to be conducted at once.
Many of the passengers who escaped in
jury maintain that the City of Trenton,
which was late when she left her wharf
in this city, was racing at her topmost
speed? and that if this had not been the
case the accident would not have hap
pened. : /This is partly rborne out by a
statement said to* have been made by As
sistant Engineer John D. Chew. . Chew
,told his wife that he expected to be killed
by an explosion on the steamer, as the
company made the engineers keep up too
high a pressure of steam.
Although the searchers, consisting of a
corps of city police, have -been dragging
the river ever since yesterday
they have been unable to find any more
bodies. That there are more victims in
the river is the firm belief of the authori
ties, and their failure to find additional
dead is supposed to be due to the strong
current in the river at the point where
the explosion occurred.
The water was pumped out of the hull
of the burned steamer, after which a
careful search was made for additional
victims of the explosion, but none waf
found. *
Racing Causes the Disaster.

hospital in the -House of Correction,: near

was put oh the stand for the prosecution,
but objection was made on the score that
he was not eligible as a witness, because
he was illegally, in the United States. He
is the man who Is alleged to have assisted
in a scheme to smuggle Chinese across the
border. The Commissioner ruled out the
testimony â¢ of the â¢Â¦ Chinese and took - the
matter under advfsement. " . . Â»
The most damaging- evidence against
Hoey was that of George Webb, a mount
.ed inspector. He said he "got on to crook
edness" in - November 1 last and bent his
energies at getting at the bottom of facts.
It was in his room that Special Agent of
the Treasury Department Dickey was se
creted in a closet and overheard a talk
between "Webb and Hoe.y of an agreement
to divide the spoils from Chinese fraudu
lently permitted to oass across the line.
The arrangement, he said, was that Webb
was " to Â¦ get $10 from each Chinaman
passed. There was to be a mark, an "A,"
on each certificate, the holder of which
was > to pass unmolested. In all these
transactions. Webb said, he was paid his
pro-rata.
Corroboration by Dickey.
Special Agent Dickey corroborated
Webb's testimony as -regards the alleged
combine, and further stated that he had
â¢ Special Dispatch to ThÂ© Call.
The defense, in asking a continuance,
made the plea that they wished data from
the Collector's office to rebut the evidence
of Webb and others before the prosecu
tion. The Commissioner granted a recess
until 7 o'clock this evening. The night
session was taken up mostly by the talk
of attorneys, r.nd at a late hour Com
missioner George said he would dismiss
the-case in which the laÂ£Â« Jossey was a
defendant on the charge of conspiracy,
but would hold Hoey on the charge of ac
cepting bribes and unlawfully permitting
Chinese to enter the United States, and
named the hour of 10 o'clock for fixing:
the amount of bor.5. It is the general
supposition that th tf rond will be placed
at 510.0CO.
"W. S. Cudaback, entry clerk in the Col
lector's office, said Frank How and other
Chinese often came Into the office to talk
with Hoey. and at all times the doors
were secured. One day Hoey called Cuda
back in and said: "There are some Chi
nese who wish to come across the line,
and there Is five dollars, apiece for you."
Cudaback pays he replied: "That is very
small and I will have nothing- to do with
It."

morning. As a result a number of people

. The Dudes came to a sudden halt along
the line of victory when they ran against
the Wasp? yesterday afternoon at Recre
ation Grounds. Then they lost a game
before it had really got under, way and
riow Cal Ewing Is betting cigars on- an
oven break for the rest of the series. The
match was noteworthy on account of the
appearance of Shay at short and Heine
rich Krug on the slab. Pabst, with a
gloved right fist, played the Cerberus of
the right garden, Xordyke doing stunts
with the first sack. . Â¦ . .
The common opinion after the game was
that Sha.y had made good all that the
bormers had represented. He hit well
and despite his single error played a fast,
snappy fielding game. Krug until the last
part of the contest was an enigma to the
Dudes. He has a swift, speedy ball, but
is a corkscrew or two shy of curves.
Krug needs a simmering down and a les
son or two on the evils of wlldness.
In the first part of the game Francks
glowed with errors as Hodson did with a
soakable delivery. Youngey Johnson was
called in as a relief and he. kept the
"Wasps? from too much buzzing until tho
end. The score:
Saa Francisco 6, Oakland 3.
The first round brought Florence Sutton
and Alice Hoffman together, and while
the former was expected to win. Miss
Hoffman was thought to have a chance.
Miss Sutton played a beautiful game, and
at no stage of the game . was
the result in doubt, as Miss Hoff
man was unable to get a game
in either Bet. The score in tavor
of Miss Sutton was 6â0, 6â0. This is a
much worse deating than Marion Jones
gave Miss Hoffman, and makes Miss Sut
ton's chances of winning the tournament
look very bright. In justice to Miss Hoff
man it should te said that she was very
nervous and did not play her best game.
Miss Sutton was cool at all times, and her
headwork was admirable. She passed her
opponent at will.
Miss Ethel Sutton next played Miss Sey
mour, whom she defeated rather easily.
The score in favor of the former was
6-0, 6-2.
Mrs. Seymour was expected to beat Mrs.
Kincaid without an effort, but to the sur
prise of evervbody the local lady won a
set quite easily after losing the first set,
6â0. The complete score in favor of Mrs.
Seymour was 6â 0. 1â6, 6â3. Mrs. Kincaid
was greatly handicapped by a lack of
tournament experience, this being only
the second tournament in which she had
ever played. She was extremely nervous
throughout the match, and would un
doubtedly have done better but for this.
Ethel Sutton has all along been con
sidered the poorest player of the four
sisters, but her, match with Mrs. Seymour
showed that she is very little behind her
sisters in point of skill. Mrs. Seymour"
played her best, but was beaten 6 â 1, 6 â 3.
Miss Sutton's smashing to the deep cor
ners of the court was particularly good.
The last match of the day was between
May Sutton and Ruby Garland .of Ojai
Valley. In spite of the fact that ! Miss
Sutton won by the' one-sided score of
6â1, 6â1, the match was very close and
exciting. Many * deuce, vantage games
were played, biit Mies Sutton won nearly
all of them by her clever driving and
smashing. At times Miss Garland played
a brilliant game, but her opponent was
much too steady for her.
Colonel Seymour offered prizes this af
ternoon for a special doubles match be
tween May and Ethel and Violet and
Florence Sutton. After a close match,
which required the full three sets. Violet
and Florence finally carried off the hon
t>rs, the score in their favor being 7â5,
2â6, 6â1.
This morning's match between May and
Florence Sutton will surely be the best
of the tournament, and although the for
mer is expected to win, the chances of
Florence are considered very good. She
is probably not as brilliant as May, and
lacks her speed, but she is far superior
to the latter in headwork. Florence is
very steady and plays a great get-back
game, which counts very much in a tour
nament - match. The semi-final match
will be played at 10:30 and the finals at
2:30 p. m. The championship match, in
which the winner of the tournament will
meet Miss Hall, the present coast cham
pion, will be played Saturday afternoon
at 2:30 o'clock.
The first match played yesterday, in
which May Sutton was opposed to Violet,
was expected to be the closest kind of a
struggle, but the former caused a genuine
surprise by making the match a runaway
affair. The score in favor of May was
6â2, 6â L The winner played brilliant ten
nis, but Violet was a trifle nervous and
hardly at her best. Many of the games
were very close and the match was more
keenly contested than the score indicates,
In this match May played by far the best
game she has put up since her arrival
at San Rafael. . Violet is very.jÂ»uch
stronger in doubles than in singles.
In the other match of the preliminary
round, Miss Seymour of Southern Califor
nia defeated Mrs. Haslett of Alameda,
the score being 7â5, 7â5. The contestants
were very evenly matched and the out
come was in doubt until the last point
was made. Mrs. Haslett made a much
better showing than was expected, and
but for a lack of practice might have
won.
May and Florence carried oft the hon
ors yesterday. The former showed by
her play that singles are more to her
Jiking than either doubles or mixed dou
bles, while Florence seems to play equally
well in all three.
As a result of the first day's play of
the women's singles tournament for the
championship of the coast, but three wo
men are left to contend for first honors,
and they are all Suttons. Ethel Button
won her semi-final match and is therefore
sure of playing in the finals this after
noon, while May and. Florence will play
this morning to determine who will be
Ethel's opponent in the finals.

Easily.
"WOODLAND, Aug. 29.â Interest in the
fair is increasing, for the attendance to
day was the largest ever seen at the
track. Nearly all business in town was sus
pended and the Woodland people turned
out en masse. The stock parade in the
morning was even better that that of
Tuesday. Stockmen of State reputation
pronounced it the best of any district
fair. The racing, however, was not as
interesting ' as on previous days. The
horses entered were high class, but not
evenly matched.
Sir Albert so far outclassed all others
in the 2:15 pace that he was barred In
the pools. Ned" Thorn won. his race with,
perfect ease. In running: the five eighths
of a mile, Catherine Bravo was left at
the post. In the mile Boardman was left
at. the post, but the race was close and
exciting. On Friday morning there will
be another bronco busting exhibition, at
which time the winners will be an
nounced. The feature of the racing card
will be a free for all pace, in which Kelly
Briggs, Delphi, Myota, Whips, Edna R
and Floracita are entered; a trot for the
2:80 class and two running races are also
on the card. The directors have aranged
to run an excursion from Oroville and
Marysville on Saturday. The card for
that day is an excellent one, and a big
crowd is expected from Sacramento on
account of the interest In the district
road race. Ho Yow's mare, Chinese Maid,
will start in the 2:30 pace with horses that

LINE TO MANILA
D. M. Carman Gives His
Views Before Local
Merchanta
D. M. Carman, a well-known merchant,
who recently returned from the Philippine
Islands, conferred with a committee of
the Board of Trade last Monday and In
cidentally gave his views on the value of
direct communication between this porty
and Manila.
Mr. Carman delivered an interesting
talk to the committee, in which he ex
pressed the hope that if there was to ba
a direct line between this country and the
islands San Francisco would have the
first line. He said it would be a great
saving to merchants, as it would avoid a
transhipment of cargoes at Hongkong. In
part he said:
"I should say roughly almost everything
that is used here except heavy clothing
could go to Manila. Nearly everything
you use is used there. The provisions
that come in. now come largely from
Spain. There la no reason why they
should not come from here that X
can see. For instance, canned and dried,
fruits, of which they use large quantities,
come from Spain, and of which very
little comes from America at â¢ present.
They get most of their meat from Aus
tralia. . In regard to canned goods, a good
deal of that stuff comes from Australia.
There have been heavy purchases made in
Australia of canned goods and of every
thing we find in Manila.
"In regard to passenger traffic, it is not
sufficiently heavy at the present time to
make it of importance. I have heard of
passengers complaining when coming
from Australia via Honolulu on the way
to the United States, .England and else
where, that when they arrived at Hono
lulu they had to submit to detention o*
half. a day, and the quarantine officer
there tried to do more than, his duty, and
made his examination as obnoxious as he
possibly could.- After submitting to that
examination they went from one Ameri
can port to another, and the United tSatea
quarantine officer here compelled them to
submit to the same examination â¢ again.
They were detained from 9 o'clock in the
morning until 5 o'clock in the evening: on
account of the quarantine officers' exam
ination, superintended by one of the depu
ties of our friend Kinyoun. The passen
gers were pronounced in their determina
tion not to take that route again, but to
go from Australia to Victoria.
"In regard to the harbor, improvements
at Manila. A year's work on the harbor
would allow the deepest ocean-going ves
sels in there, and they would be fairly
well sheltered. When our harbor is com
pleted it will be very much better than
Hongkong 1 . It is equally as good now for
three or four, possibly five, months-iu the
year. We have a cold storage plant that
cost $1,500,000. It is one of the finest Iti
the world. .It la a Government plant, but
when I came away they were willing to
allow others to use the plant. The army
cannot use anything: like the space they
have there. It 13 four stories hijrh and,
roughly speaking. I should say it was
250 feet front and 400 feet deep. Poisibiy
it ia larser than that."

Larsen, proprietor of the Pioneer sa
loon, appeared before Warrant and Bond
Clerk Peery last evening and asked for
warrants for the arrest of Police Officers
E. C. Daltbn and Joseph F. Lycett. one
of whom struck him with a club and the
other tore his clothes. Judge Cabaniss
refused, to issue the warrants until after
he had an opportunity to investigate the
complaint. - Â¦ .
Three other men were treated at the
Harbor Hospital for injuries received in
the affray. They were John Nisbeck of
249 Steuart street, Martin Jensen of 250
East street and Henry Way of 19 Steuart
street. Many others were, injured, but
they dfd not go to the Harbor Hospital
to have their wounds dressed. . .
In such close quarters the work of the
police was telling-. Man after man, after
receiving a whack on the head, darted
for the nearest .exit and the place was
soon cleared. Walter Larsen, proprietor
of the saloon, put himself in the way of
the police and got several blows on the
head, and John Tibboel, who stood upon
his dignity and dared the officers to touch
him. received a blow on the back. , Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
Broken Heads at Hospital.
The crowd had grown to such' numbers
that the street was blockaded. Several
other teams that could not get -through
the crowd stopped on Folsom street and
the mounted olncers escorting their driv
ers left them and .went to the assistance
of the policeman surrounded by the. mob.
With drawn clubs they rode into the
crowd, and for a timo it seemed that the
riot was over. But the men were stub
born, and many of them on the outskirts
of the crowd commenced' throwing bricks
from a pile near a building Â¦ in , course of
construction on Steuart street.
Sergeant Cook anu every officer on duty
in the district, came running ..up and
charged into" the crowd. The long-'- riot
clubs fell time and again on the heads
of the strikers, but the attack seemed to
have little effect. . . , '.:-
A number of police officers charged
the mob from the rear and with good ef
fect, for the angry men ran to escape the
clubs. Those who were in front felt the
crowd behind them weakening and they
also commenced to seek shelter from the
rain of blows coming from the bluecoats.
So fiercely- were they pressed hy the offi
cers that 'they were compelled to run into
buildings in the neighborhood.
Fully llfty*of them ran into the Pioneer
saloon. The officers were close behind
them, but the door was slammed In their
faces by the proprietor, who deliberately
shook his fists at the officers as they
turned and continued driving the rest of
the crowd away. The crowd in the saloon,
safe, as it thought, from any further
clubbing, commenced to yell and jeer the
officers . and kept it up until the police
forced the doors and attacked them once
more.
Mob Blockades Street
The row was started by "the breaking
down of a truck in front of the Pioneer
Saloon and Hotel at .249 Steuart street.
Fully a hundred union men were con
gregated in front of the hotel. The
crowd started hooting the driver and
jeering at his efforts to get his team
started. The yells attracted every idle
man on' the street to the scene, and in a
short time the crowd had grown to mam
moth proportions. The mounted officer
who was escorting the driver tried to
drive the crowd uack, but they surged
all about him and his efforts were fruit

The strikers ran. into a saloon in the

Juuiie RJU. Mllitz of L Chicago, formerly
According to the police, the strikers
were impartial in their attacks upon col
ored men for the remainder of the even
ing'- -
It seems that the colored workmen havo
been In the' habit of donning their very
best clothes for the trip to and
from work. While on the street they
have posed as gentlemen of leisure. The
fashionable garb was exchanged for blue
shirt and overalls ' at the workshop or
wharf and doffed for good clothes at
quitting time. . ' '
The strikers have been puzzling for
some time over the mystery of the ab
sence of colored laborers from the ranks
of non-union men going and returning
from work. They solved the problem yes
terday and spent last night in making up
for lost time.
By this time the police had been noti
fied and before the union delegation thor
oughly realized that their "coon" hunt
had fizzled out Policeman Fraher, with a
dozen of his brothers in blue, was dis
persing the mob.
Then a committee- was appointed to
search the kitchen. They found nothing
but the tracks which told them how the
bird had flown.
Meanwhile the mob crowded into the
restaurant. They demanded the "nig
ger." The proprietor protested. They
threatened. The proprietor went to the
kitchen, but returned, saying-, "No nigger
there." '
He succeeded in clearing a starting
space. With a howling mob at his heels
and cries of "lynch the nigger scab" in
his ears, he sprinted up Mission street to
Third. Turning to the left he rushed In
at the open door of a restaurant and
without a word of explanation or apology
dashed into the kitchen, out into the
back yard, over a fence, through the back
door of a house facing on Mission street
and then, through the kindness of the
tenant, to Mission by way of the front
door. Then he, too, disappeared.
They lingered on the water front for an
hour after the 6 o'clock whistle had an
nounced the end of the working day.
They wanted the, gang to get tired and
disperse. But they waited in vain. They
finally "boarded a Mission-street car and
all went well until Second street was
reached. The gang was there. The at
tacking party piled on to the car and
just as expeditiously the colored laborers
piled off. They were eight strong. Six of
them formed a wedge, broke through the
enemy's ranks and disappeared into the
night. The seventh had scented danger
early In the game and effected an inde
pendent retreat. No. 8, cut off from his'
friends, hemmed in by the union delega
tion now doubly incensed owing to the
escape of the seven, started to fight his
way to freedom.
The colored laborers are engaged along
the .water front. For their mutual pro
tection they all live together in a lodging
house on Second street, between Mission
and Howard. They have been in the habit
of going to work in a body and returning
at the end of the day in similar forma
tion. They received information yester
day to the effect that a gang of strikers
had been organized for the purpose of
"doing them up" on their return from,
work.
A prompt and proper discretion, the
ability to sprint expeditiously and a turn
for strategy last night saved a party of
colored non-union laborers from a "doing
up" at the hands of a delegation of strik
ers.

Thomas Morgan, a union fireman, was
r-hot in the shoulder last night by Alex
Xambof. a non-union man of the same
occupation. The shooting occurred on the
Ercadwsy deck shortly after 6 o'clock.
Nambos is employed on the steamer
Santa Cruz. He says he started up the
dock on the way to his home, when a
number of union men approached
him. After a short argument the mob
crowded around and commenced to use
their fists freely, knocking him down and
bruising his head. Believing his life to
be in danger, the fireman then drew his
revolver and fired four shots. One of the
bullets struck Morgan in the shoulder
and the remainder of the mob quickly
disappeared.

Thrasher was driving along Steuart
street, accompanied by Mounted Officer

As the stable of his employers was only

policeaian to notify the foreman of what
sad happened. Scarcely had the officer
left him when a crowd of about twenty
Btnkers attacked Thrasher and dragged
pim from his s*;at on the truck. The
teamster's cries for help attracted the at

b'- -^ MPLOYING draymen and striking teamsters seemed to be, approaching
agreement for a time yesterday. A second conference was held and 'definite
terms were submitted by the draymen, embodying -an additional clause in'
lm -*^ accordance with a suggestion of the teamsters. But when the Brother
hood of Teamsters met in regular meeting at night the proposition made
by the employers, which is given above, was rejected by a unanimous vote.
The conference had ' been arranged bj* the conciliation committee of the Mu
nicipal Federation of Improvement Clubs, and the teamsters had been sent to it by
the strike leaders in the hope that formal recognition of the Brotherhood of Team
sters would thus be made by the Draymen's Association. The draymen, however,
carefully avoided such recognition by insisting that they were there as individual
draymen to meet individual employes, and not as a committee of employers to meet
a committee of employes.
The strike leaders took the ground that the.proposition was not authorized and
no settlement based upon it could be satisfactory. The teamsters, even those who
were favorably impressed by the terms offered, swung into line and sanctioned the
stand taken by the leaders.
The conference was held in the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance building. Charles
L. Tilden. Grove Ayers, George Renner and Aaron Englander were present as in
dividual draymen. The teamsters in the, meeting were Frederick Fitzpatrick, Frank
Markey. George Thomas, James Kirkpatrick and Thomas Jolley. â¢ . Â»
Â¦â>,'Â¦ Terms Modified at the Request of Teamsters.
At the first conference, held Wednesday . afternoon, terms upon which the
teamsters would be allowed to resume work were submitted by the draymen.
They were identical with the terms printed above, except that th* words "and
they may come back to work as union men," and in the next sentence, "but
will not allow the union to interfere with our business in any manner" were not
embodied in the statement. The teamsters conferred with each other, and later
offered the suggestion that if a clause were inserted specifying that the team
sters would be allowed to go back to work as union men they believed the
terms offered would be accepted by tli<^ teamsters. It -was. then decided that a
second meeting should be held the following day. "
At this 'second meeting, at half-past 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the dray
men presented the modified terms which are printed above.. They had inserted
the' clause desired by the teamsters, but had added to offset It the clause, "but
will not allow the union to Interfere with our business in any manner." -
The five teamsters retired for consultation and presently returned and put
the following question to the draymen:
Will you recognize the Brotherhood of Teamsters and reinstate the teamsters as mem
bers thereof and recognize their right to act through their organization in a collective
capacity?
The draymen replied simply by referring to the proposition they had made,
refusing to enter into any discussion or explanation of the terms submitted.
Draymen Present as Individuals. .
The teamsters asked the draymen whom they represented and what authority
they had to act. The draymen replied that they came here are individual dray-
The teamsters then asked the draymen the following question:
VClIl each individual drayman answer for himself the question: Are ' you as an in
dividual drayman willing and able to recognize and deal with the Brotherhood of Team
sters on behalf of the teamsters?
The draymen replied, "You already have our proposition and we - have "no
other answer."
The individual members being urged to reply, Mr. Ayers said, "We have talk
ed this thing all over, and 1 acquiesce with my friends, and we have given our
answer."
Mr. Renner said: "I have submitted the proposition as an individual dray
man, and we have stipulated to work under that proposition."
The conference was brought to a close, with the : understanding that the
teamsters would take the proposition under advisement. Their method, of course,
would be to refer the matter to the Brotherhood of- Teamsters and the strike
leaders.
Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the Sailors' Union, said last night before the
teamsters met that the terms would not be accepted. He said the committee
of teamsters had been induced to meet th^ draymen under the false representa
tion that the five draymen represented the Draymen's Association. Since the em
ployers were there only as Individuals, there could be no authorized proposition
worthy of consideration submitted by them.
Conference That Gave Much Promise
Comes to Naught Because Em
ployers Do Not Recognize Union.
UNION FIREMAN IS SHOT.
In the course of the meeting: expressions
were taken from a large number of mem
bers as to their opinion as to the condi
tion of the strike. They reported confer
ences voluntarily sought by their striking
employes, expressing an earnest desire for
the trouble to be over, and in every case
stating their belief that it was nearing an
end.
The meeting adjourned subject to the
call of the chair, the committee appointed
to confer with the Mayor being: instructed
if necessaiy to report progress at such
cdjourned meeting.
Further remarks were made by Police
Commissioner Newhall and a number of
other members at the meeting, all In the
direction of doing something that would

commanding that peace be kept and that
riotous assemblages on the streets be
avoided.
Chief of Police Sullivan, who was pres
ent, was asked to make a statement of
the situation. He said that the Police
Depaitment h?.d the strike situation well
in hand up to the time of the proceed
ings in Judgre Cabaniss' court, and that
when that Police Judge punished a po
liceman for doing his duiy and refused
to hold men who were guilty of breaches
pt" the peace the situation changed, and
the police naturally lost control of it. the
riotously disposed â¢Â¦ strikers saying to
them: "We do not rare for you; we have
the courts on our side." That decision,
in the judgment of the Chief of Police,
coupled with other ill-advice to the
etrikers g1vÂ«=r: by the Examiner,
led to the riotous demonstrations of
Wednesday, and may lead to other like
demonstrations. ChieÂ» Suilivan assured
the meeting of the desire of the Police
l>epartroent to do its full duty and to con
vince the disorderly and riotous that it
had the law abiding people of the city be
hind it and would enforce the law regard

Cabaniss yesterday. Anderson testified

the district in a buggy throughout the
day. Striking teamsters in little squads
visited the scene of the previous day's
battle and seemed to take keen enjoyment
in recounting the stories of some of the
hottest engagements.
"That means that you have ' decided
against us," remarked Attorney Dunne;
"but I would ask you to. defer your formal
ruling in the matter. '
The Judge said h3 would not make his
formal ruling till this morning, which was
satisfactory. . . .
"The only point," continued the Judge,
"that perplexes me, and that very little,
is the distinction that the Sheriff is a
county officer and I am a charter officer.
The Sheriff might decline to serve the
venire. Then he could be cited for con
tempt and that would te'st the Â¦ case. I
will issue the venire to the Sheriff."- T
"If," retorted the Judge, "such a ridicu
lous, folly were perpetrated it would-be a
gross and palpable error and a bar to fur
ther proceeding." . ',
"If," interrupted Attorney Dunne, "a
jury of twelve women were summoned
and rendered a verdict; would that be a
bar to further proceeding?" .
"I am also strongly â¢ persuaded â though
that might be, so far as I am concerned,
a matter of future considerationâ that,
taking Mr. Dunne's view to be the correct
one, namely, that I have r.o power to
order the Sheriff to act In this matter, but
nevertheless I do order him to act and
he does act and a venire is returned and
jurors appear In obedience to that venire,
and a trial otherwise agreeable to the
rules of law was folio-wed by a verdict of
acquittal. It seems to me, at the very
most and very worst, I would simply, ac
cording to Mr. Dunne's contention of the
law, have committed an error, and if
subsequent to the return of such a verdict
it was sought â¢ again to place Captain
Wittman on trial for thj off ense - with
which he now stands 'charged, the first
verdict would be pleaded as a bar to any
further' proceedings of that character.''
"And with reference to one point, that
is, that a verdict returned at the hands of
a jury selected by the Sheriff would 1 not
be a vindication against this charge. I
submit -with all candor; viewing the mat
ter from the standpoint of vindication for
the moment rather than from the stand
point of its legal effect or consequence,
it would be infinitely a more complete
vindication than would be such a verdict
rendered in the case at the hands of. the
jury selected in the ordinary manner,
namely, by the Chief of Police, or, actu
ally, as is practically the case, by some
subordinate of the Chief of Police.
"But It is not enough in all cases that
the duties appertaining to the administra
tion of justice have been properly per
formed. It is just as essential where it
can be so ordered that justice be admin
istered even collaterally, and by what I
might characterize as auxilary agents of
justice, in a manner to free the proceed
ing, whether it may be a trial by jury or
any other, absolutely of ?all suspicion
even. . Â¦ . : :>. .' .; .-;
this venire to the Sheriff is not at all from
my standpoint a matter of discretion, for
this reason: If I had the power to have
this venire executed, to order it executed
by the Sheriffâ my present judgment, af
ter listening very . carefully to what has
been said, is that I have that power â I
would exercise it, and I would do that not
because I assume, and, indeed, in all
frankness. I will say, not that I believe,
because I .do not believe, that if this
venire were placed in the hands of Chief
of Police Sullivan he would execute it,
and so far as he could control the situa
tion, would cause it to be executed other
wise than fairly and legally.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALt^ FRIDAY, AUGUST 30. 190 1.
-The Judge said: "I think the matter is
exactly as stated by Mr. Dunne in this
one particular, namely, the matter ad
dressing Itself to the court as to whether
or not the court has the power to send
Attorney Dunne vigorously opposed the
request and argued that under the char
ter the Juflge 'had â¢ no discretion in the
matter, but must order the Chief of Police
to serve the venire. The Sheriff was a
county offlcr and' to ask him to serve the
venire would in his judgment be a vain
and .futile act. Barrett replied . that it
would be a vain and futile act to allow
the defendant or a co-ordinate officer to
summon the jury. Much depended upon
the district in which the jurors would be
summoned, and if they were selected' in
some districts it would, be useless to try
the case* He contended that the Judge
had the discretionary power, to ask the
"Sheriff, marshal, constable or police offi
cer" to. serve the venire, which was again
combated by Dunne, who contended that
the words were distributory in theij^lnter
pretation, the Sheriff being for the.Supe
rior and Justices' courts, the marshal for
a city, the constable for a township, and
the police officer for the police courts.
The Chief of Police was a man of unblem
ished integrity and would perform his
duty in the premises fairly and equitably.
It was here that the groans of the strik
ers were uttered. -. . . , ".
Attorney Barrett precipitated a long ar
gument by asking the Judge to order the
Sheriff to serve the venire instead of the
Chief of Police.
After 'the case was called, Attorney Hos
mer entered a plea of not guilty and de
manded a trial by jury.
The case of Captain George W. Witt
man, charged with battery upon James
Masse, a striking- marine fireman, was

morning. Attorney John J. Barrett ap
peared as special prosecutor, and the de
fendant, who was present, was repre
sented by Attorneys Hosmer and- Peter
Dunne. The courtroom was crowded with
strikers, and twice when Attorney Dunne
in his argument referred to Chief Sulli
van In complimentary terms the strikers
emitted groans. The Judge said nothing
after , the first demonstration, but when It
was' repeated he said he would have the
courtroom cleared if there was any fur
ther demonstration of the kind.

Within a time comparatively short we may- expect
to see a well perfected system of the new. telegraphy
established between this city and the"Tarallohes.
The governmental authorities are now working out
such a ' system,- and - have our interests in mind, y.lil
'may be, as the Tribune has said, that the installation r
of the service ; at ; Nantucket has not received the Jat- '
It will be seen that the development of the system
is going â¢ forward with a rapidity that keeps pace
with the most sanguine expectations of those who
noted the first experiment of The Call in obtaining
by wireless telegraphy the announcement of- the ap
proach of the transport bringing home the Califor
nia Volunteers from Manila.
One of the most interesting demonstrations of the
power of the new telegraphy was obtained, quite un
expectedly during the recent maneuvers of the Brit
ish Channel fleet. A summary of an official report
on the svibject to the Navy Department at Washing
ton says: "Messages were exchanged up to a dis
tance of ninety miles between two ships, when "com
munication suspended owing to a minor break.
The instrument onone vessel was then adjusted to
send a. message to Portland, and, to the surprise of
the signaling staff, that station was heard 'talking' to
a second ship. The distance at which this'informa
tion was taken_was 103 miles as the crow flies, a rec
ord so far as the naval, service is concerned."
It is probable, however, that in the near future
there will be hardly any port of importance in the
civilized world unprovided with some system of
wireless telegraphy. The adoption of the improve
ment is going on much more rapidly than many per
sons suppose. Thus the New York Tribune, in com
menting upon the establishment of the wireless news
service of the Herald from Nantucket lightship to the
island and thence to the mainland, says: "The first
application of Marconi's invention to systematic work
in America a few days ago has hardly received the
attention which so important an event deserves. The
establishment of a wireless telegraph station at the
quaint little village of 'Sconset, on the island of Nan
tucket, ushers in. a new era in communication be
tween passengers on incoming steamships and their
friends on shore. It will also give those on board
an ocean liner earlier tidings of occurrences since
they left the shores of Europe. At least twelve hours
are now cut off from the period of enforced silence
incident to a trans-Atlantic voyage."
There is no questioning the truth of that statement,
but it should be applied jjot to the Canadian Gov
ernment only. There are other rich and enlightened
countries whose foggy coasts are unmarked by* the
new telegraphy, and among them is our own. r
BY way of preparing for the approach of the
Duke and Duchess of Cornwall to the Cana-^
dian ports on their tour of the empire, the
British Admiralty has ordered the installation of a
wireless telegraph system along that coast. Com
menting upon the fact, the Boston Globe says: "It
is a wise provision for the royal visit, but other ves
sels needing to pass that dangerous cape ought v to
be similarly safeguarded. It is little to the credit of
either the Dominion or to the imperial authorities
that a region so notorious for its shipwrecks should
have to wait for the Ophir's approach to get an
equipment that was required long ago."

A CHANGE TO; SMILE.
The threat of Texas to place a heavy tax upon the
oil output will not stop the "gushers," but it has al
ready mixed a sound of wailing with the gush.
With such prospects- ahead. :the; twentieth century,
promises to be even more 'marvelous than the nine-
.teenth. The' man of ; the past who" has had money. fo.
burn- will be as .nothing in comparison- with, the man '.
I of, the future who has aluminum for. fuel.
In commenting upon the subject Dr. Andrew Wil
son argues that the diamond, the ruby and other jew
els may be produced by such a* degree of
heat as was caused by the combustion of aluminum
during the experiments. -He says: "To produce the
diamond from carbon by imitation, of; the ways of
nature in the past intense heat is essential; therefore
the idea of iising metals as fuel may supply enterpris
ing science with' means of building up the jewel, such
as have been hitherto wanting. Sir W. Roberts-Aus
ten, indeed," himself sounds a note of hopeful augury
here: -He tells us' that', the alumina which results from
the reduction of oxide, of chromium, when ut- is al
lowed to ; cool, .'forms large, ruby-tinted: crystalline
masses, closely. resemblingTthei natural ruby.'* Again.
in an interesting peroration the lecturer tells us that
.'the burning of aluminum' as fuel gives us sapphires
and rubies iii the ukj^ce of ashes, and metallic -fuel is
burned, not .by the air, above,' but by the : oxygen" de
rived from the Â¦earth beneath, as it occurs in the fed
and, yellow oxides to, which our rocks and cliffs owe
their. color and, beauty."
Of course no such intense heat is needed for ordi
nary purposes, but science can make good use of it
in many ways, and when science has led the way art
will not be long in following. It was pointed out that
such heat will enable us to approach the intense
temperature I under which our planet was developed,
and we may thereby be enabled to some extent at
least tc reproduce the processes by which. many of
the metallic and other constituents of the earth's sur
face were -formed. That in turn would imply our
power of . reproducing them from their original
elements. â¢ ,
The report of the lecture says: * ''The oxygen for
the combustion of the metal is supplied by metallic
oxides, because these latter readily: part with -their
oxygen to the metal if it be raised.to a certain heat.-
The experiment was. remarkable, for its results. A
mixture of oxide of iron, ferric oxide and finely di
vided aluminum was ignited by a piece of magnesium
wire. The heat produced wasintense. According to
Sir W.. Roberts-Austen, no known pyrometer or heat
measuring apparatus can ; sum it up. He, believes the
heat thus evolved to' be. about, 3000 degrees centi-"
grade." - '/.
We have now had cheap aluminum for some years,
and there is, no longer^ any enthusiasm on the sub
ject. However, it is likely there will be a new and
greater enthusiasm very soon, for 'the London Chron
icle reports that in a recent address at the Royal
Institution Sir W. Roberts-Austen spoke of the com
mercial and practical bearings of. "petals as Fuel,"
and says the chief idea of the discourse, and the prin
cipal experiments,; centered around the use of alumi
num for that, purpose.
ONLY a few years ago aluminum was rare and
costly. It was "a disputed question whether
it could ever be produced in Â¦ quantities of
commercial value at anything like an economical
rate. In those years of experiment in the production
of the metal it was frequently predicted that as soon
as it could be furnished cheaply enough to be avail
able for manufacturing purposes it would work some
thing like a revolution in. the civilized San
guine enthusiasts spread abroad glowing accounts of
what great benefits might be expected when once
this light and beautiful metal was at the service of
\ humanity. â
\ ALUMINUM AS- FUEL. ~~ "
It is a sere thing to say, but it is true, that human
ity Mould rejoice at any complication that would
work retribution in behalf of a brave people, whose
only offense is love of their land and defense of their
freedom and their homes. The United States has no
other stake in the issue, as far as sentiment is con
cerned. On the material tide we have nothing to
lose. "Such a clash as is impending would defer the
proposed European trade concert to oppose what is
called abroad our commercial aggressions, and a war
would simply increase the call upon our surplus to
supply the nations involved. ; There may be another
appearance of sentiment, or many'such appearances,
but the matter goes^ deeper than any trivial dispute
between France and the Sultan. The Ottoman torch
may light, at the beginning of the twentieth, a fire as
great - as Bonaparte started at â¢ the beginning of the
nineteenth century. -. . â¢ '.'...'
">n the South African republicans is the same that
disgraced Spain in dealing with the Cubans. The
British besom has swept the Boer country clean of
all the meansÂ«of subsistence. The farms have been
burned, unspeakable outrages committed, and weak
women and children have been ruthlessly slaught
ered, by famine and disease, in the camps to which
they have been driven like cattle to be treated worse
than brutes. â¢ :
She has sought control in all the Danubian states,
and apparently has not lost the desire to dominate the
Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. It is at present a
great play of diplomacy which may easily be ex
changed for the harder game of war. In her emer
gency Turkey can rely on England, but Adam Zad,
the bear, evidently. feels that England can stand no
further strain upon her resources than the Boer war
is imposing and that now is the time to strike. The
Sultan, whose miseries are quite incapable of aug
mentation, may well feel that he has nothing to lose
by precipitating the conflict of which his empire will
.be the earliest theater. His army is unpaid. His
diplomatic representatives are without salary, and his
administration is decayed to the marrow. Revolt is
ripe for adtion among his subjects, who are no
longer restrained by the bonds even of religion. Tur
key in Europe may be about to pass away, and the
territory it has occupied will fall to the strongest.
During the last year there have been many evi
dences of a substantial concert among the Continen
tal powers, so that it is doubtful if even Germany will
actively interfere with the plans of the Czar. The
passing of Turkey in Europe would be a distinct gain
to civilization, but the greatest sentimental result of
a present conflict would be the helping of the in
domitable Boers. The English people are rest
less under the prolonged war, which is be
ginning lo reflect upon England's military pri-*
macy, and still more seriously upon her hu
manity. Admissions of her own officers are
a Wed to other evidence that her method of warfare
THE renewal of '.he French trouble with the Sul
tan is portentous. There is no doubt that
?France and Russia are in accord. Ever since
the Berlin treaty deprived Russia of the right to oc
cupy Constantinople after the Balkan campaign that
empire has pressed her Asiatic frontier southward to
reach open water. Her appearance in affairs in Per
sia and Afghanistan, in Korea and China, is in pur
suance of an aspiration cherished ever since the time
of Peter the Great. To be a first-class maritime
power Russia must have and control seaports on un
frozen water. Turkey has been used to block the
way against her frorn^ the Mediterranean to the Black
Sea, and England lias interposed between her and
the Persian Gulf.
It seems to be a foregone conclusion that if the
Czar on his arrival in Paris should express any de
sire for .a partition of Turkey, France would be very
willing to help inMhe carving.

the Lutheran church on this coast. On
his arrival here he took. charge of a lit
tle church . on' Greenwich street. From
Greenwich street Pastor Buehler_ moved
his rapidly growing congregation" to the
church on Geary street, between Stockton
Suddenly he put his hand *to his head
and gasped. His wife and daughter
hastened to his side, but too late. The
zealous Christian worker, who for forty

hastily summoned. They pronounced
that death was immediate apd gave th&
cause as apoplexy.
Death came suddenly. The pastor
had spent the evening with some friends
arid returned , home shortly before 10

Emma he sat in his study chatting about
the approaching wedding of Miss Emma
to Rev. Mr. Tietien of Crockett.

HARD AND SOFT WATER-S. X, City.
Hard water la Impregnated with earths
and minerals. Rain water Is called soft
water because it Is not so Impregnated.
Exposure to the air will soften hard
water, so will soda or borax.
The death of such a "man may be truly accounted
a loss to the whole community. It will be felt in that
way by thousands of sincere and loving hearts, and
the bereaved family in their sorrow will have every
sympathy humanity can give. â¢
The essential characteristics of the man were
hereditary. He came of a family distinguished for
faithful and worthy service in whatsoever line of work
the members of it undertook. One of his brothers
holds the position of naval attache, doing service at
the courts of Berlin, Vienna and Rome, and is" hon
ored both at home and abroad, while others of his
family, though less widely known, are held itrnot less
esteem by those who come in contact with them. -
It. is not among Lutherans only that his. services
were useful and uplifting." His - fine life has an in
fluence wider than his parish, or' -the circle of those'
who embrace his creed.'- By. the moral order of the
world a good man's life has^.- issues far beyond the
reach of his personal acquaintance. The emanations
of a noble nature reflected from' mind to mind arid
soul to soul broaden out through all the processes of
human intercourse, and affect the hearts and the con
duct of thousands who may never have met nor even
heard of the individual from whom they emanated.
Mr/ Buehler was one of those strong. natures that
constitute an elementary force in society and help to
hold the social organism together by spiritual bonds
âinvisible, but irrefrangible, and not to be broken
by force or worn away by time.
Mr. Buehler came to San Francisco forty-one years
ago and founded the first Lutheran church in this
city. He was therefore a pioneer of the State as
well as the father of Lutheranism in California.:
The success of his work is attested throughout the
length and breadth of the land. Lutheran churches
have arisen and Lutheran communities have flour
ished among us largely through his personaHeading
and the potent influence of his example. To the
younger pastors of his church he was a never failing
inspiration and help. They looked to him' as to
a father, nor ever looked-in vain for all a father's
kindly and gracious counsel and aid in any issue in;
which they appealed to him. Â¦;'
WITH profound sorrow, the . people of San
Francisco, and many throughout the- entire-,
country, learn of the death of the Rev.
Jacob M. Buehler, pastor of St. Paul's Lutheran
Church in this city. The sorrow is the more acute Â¦
because the death came suddenly and unexpectedly.:
No heart was prepared for the blow. To; his family, .
to.his relatives and. to the' wide circle of his parish
ioners and friends it has come like an appalling ca
lamity.

MANILA-Subscriber, Butte Valley, Cal.
The shortest route from San Francisco to
Manila, P. I., by steamer Is by the great
circle route, 6237 miles. Manila la con
nected by submarine cable with China.
The business men and property-owners of this city,
the vast mass of peaceful laborers, appeal for order
and safety. They counsel the mistaken rioters and^
assailants of peaceful men to pause and consider that
they endanger their own rights when they attack the
rights of others. If they will not listen to any but
the advisers who put murder in their hearts, the issue
will be met. No city has ever surrendered to a mob,
and San Francisco will not set the cowardly ex
ample, though the United States have to use its
army to help her resist. "~ ,
Government is a trust, and under our system it
never fails for lack of a trustee. The city is the pri
mary trustee of government here. If it fail the State
succeeds it, and, if the State fail, the United States
is the ultimate trustee, and so far nobody has whipped
the United States. - .
But it will "not dissolve. The business of the t United
States must go on. The transports that load and un
load at this city will not be sent to Seattle or Ta
coma because the laborers who load and discharge
them cannot be protected here from murderous at
tacks. Already fifty strikers have fallen upon eight
of these United States laborers and beaten /them
nearly to death. It was not only the act of cowards,
but of men Who have no regard either for the good
name or the prosperity of San Francisco. Let such
understand that these laborers will be protected. , If
the city government cannot do it the troops at the
Presidio will.
In no case has one man fairly attacked one man.
The strikers have gone in parties largely outnumber
ing their intended victims. This has been unfair,
unAmerican and unmanly. The men attacked have
been only standing on their lawful right to labor and
take wages. If the law cannot or will not protect
men in this, then government is dissolved.
There will be no surrender. If those who are
charged, with the maintenance of law and order skulk
and refuse to use their authority to protect life and
property, then the city will pay dearly for every blow
taken, every life sacrificed and every dollar of prop
erty destroyed. From the beginning of the strike the
mob spirit has been insidiously cultivated by the
demagogues and evil counselors of the strikers. It
has been that sort of advice that educates the man
hood out of men, destroys their respect for fair play
and makes them cowards. Hence we have seen gangs
of ten beset one helpless boy and beat him into a
pulp, and when he escaped he was pursued by the
whole party and struck' down again, and when he de
fended himself with his pistol the men who had
sought his life yelled "Murder!" : >-.Vk||
The daily attacks of the Examiner on the police,
the action of a police magistrate in fining an officer
for preserving the peace and setting free those who
broke the peace, and the incendiary advice of a law
yer to the strikers to arm and shoot policemen, all
led surely to one endâ the mob and attacks upon life
and property. It marks the end of the strike. There
can be no capitulation to violence, no surrender to a
mob." Bad advice has borne. its fruit, its intended
fruit, and has raised the issue whether government
and public order shall'surrender to violence: '
WE have referred to the bad advice to which
the- strikers have been subjected. They
.. could follow it or not, as they chose. We
regret for their sake that they have followed it to its
final and only logical conclusion", a display of mob
violence. V

PHENOMENAL INCREASE
IN CITY BANK DEPOSITS
The British steel vessel Baroda is hard
and fast on a Eandy beach nlne v miles
south of Coquille River. The vessel was
bound from Callao for Portland to load
wheat for Europe and last Sunday was
close to her destination. On the 25th Inst.
she was In latitude 42 degrees north, longi
tude 130 degrees west, and on that occa
sion Captain Hays of the St. Paul gave
Captain Marr of the bark his position. It
was very foggy at the time and a strong
current was running. Captain Marr must
have again lost his way and run his ves
sel ashore in the fog. A dispatch to the
Merchants' Exchange states that the crew
was saved, that the sta is smooth at Co
quille and two powerful tugs would stand
a good chance, of saving the vessel.
A later dispatch states that the .vessel
went ashore at l;30 a. m. yesterday. She
struck head on and swung around and is
now -lying with her bow to the sea. Cap
tain Marr has two heavy anchors out on
the' vessel and hopes to save her. Those
who have had experience in the locality
think the vessel will not be saved, how
ever. She is in ballast and It has not
shifted. , "
Captain Pedersen of the collier Tellus
says that for the last two weeks the fog
along the Oregon coast has been very
heavy A lot of smoke is mixed in with
it, which makes matters worse. On his
way north the ! captain says his usual
course is north by west half west, but on
the occasion of his last run he had to
steer north and then the -current wa3 so
strong that he couldn't keep his course.
Coming home he had to stand half a point
in all the way down. This coupled with
fog has made navigation on the coast ex
ceedingly difficult, and Captain Pedersen
thinks the going ashore of the Baroda
was due to these causes.
The local tug companies here will not
send- boats to the wreck, as they say
there are several available in the vicinity.
The Baroda Is 1353 tons net burden and
is a sister ship to the Lucknow that was
here last year. She was built in 1891 by
A. McMullan & Co. of Dumbarton, Scot
land and is owned by W. & J. Crawford
of Greenock. She is 237 feet 5 Inches long,
36 feet 2 inches beam and 21 feet 5 inches
deep. ':.; ''<Â¦ ->^ : "'-""V,::V-:

The Valencia brought down Captain W.
G. Porter of the wrecked whaler Gram
pus'from Nome and twenty-nine Italians
and fifty-six Chinese from Orca. On the
23st inst., at 7 p." m., when 345 miles west
three-quarters north of Flattery, the Brit
ish steamer Manauense, from Vancouver,
B. C, for St. Michael, was spoken with
her thrust shaft broken. Captain Graham
of the Valencia is of the opinion that the
disabled vessel will reach the Sound 'all
right.
â¢â¢The steam whaler Grampus is a total
loss near Cape Smith," said Captain Por
ter yesterday. "It has been particularly
hard this season in the Arctic and we on
the Grampus got more than our share of
it. We worked our way north from Cape
Hope for a distance of over 300 miles and
on the morning of July 17 I stood to the
eastward and encountered a heavy floe
of solid ice. The next morning the breeze
died out and the northeast current set us
down on the ice pack, then four miles
from Ehore. Eajly in the afternoon of the
ISth a dense fos set in and an hour later
thick ice was encountered.
"I did not like the look of things and
started under steam for the south. - In a
quarter of an hour we ran into great
pieces of ice and soon afterward found
ourselves caught in the pack. The Gram
pus was forced backward by the ice and
went stern first against a big ridge, which
stove in eleven timbers on the port side.
The vessel was still carried along and in
a few minutes she was fast on a sharp
point. We got the steam pumps to work
and all hands to shifting the coal and
supplies from the after hold forward. In
this way we lightened her up aft and got
her going again and finally beached her
two miles north of Refuge Inlet and ten
miles south of Cape Smith.
"Soon after the Grampus was beached
the steam whaler Jeanettte came along
and Captain Newth, our carpenter and
myself held a survey and decided that
the old vessel was unseaworthy. I sold
hull and supplies for the benefit of the
underwriters, C. D. Browers of the Liebes
whaling station and Captain Newth of
the Jeanette paying $1650 for the lot. The
Jeanette took us to Point Hope and from
there the schooner Helen took us to Teller
and the steamer Elk to Nome. Some of
the crew remained In Alaska. Fifth Mate
Paul Miller, Chief Engineer John D. Cer
rick Assistant Engineer Mitchell Johnson
and Carpenter G. C. Dawson came home
with me."

came from Nome via the canneries, the

Guam and Honolulu.
AMONG the numerous vessels to
arrive in port yesterday were the

The excellence of the programme and
courteous treatment accorded the resi
dents of this city by the employes of the
big circus have been appreciated. Every
performance has had an immense au
dience. It was feared that the strike
would have a bad effect on the attend
ance, but. on the contrary, it has not. The
circus comes once a year, and the children
look forward to a treat that the hardest
hearted parent never falls to give them
The backward dive of Le Fleur, the dar
ing work of the Halloways on the wire
and the wonderful riding of Champion
Rooney were the features of last night's
performance.
The elephants divide the comedy honors
v.ith the clowns. These big beasts' ac
tually work out a farce comedy scene with
a sense of humor that is as amazing aa
It is comical. They march, dance, play
musical instruments and dine, and finally
one of them gets gloriously "full' and is
placed under arrest by another big fel
low, who looks strong- enough to move a
building. The small boy naturally turns
to the downs. There are some thirty or
more, grotesquely busy, to give him his
money's worth. The fellows on stilts
Â¦were made a target for peanuts and wlttv
pslltes from the irrepressible youngster*
This made more fun for the spectators as
the clowns frequently got back In answers
equally as good as those sent. Every
minute of the time is occupied by excel
lent features from the opening parade to
the closing races, and the circus patrons
find a rare diversion from the worrying
care common to life. ____â-'"
The attendance at Ringling Brothers'

on the foremast hanging in rags.
After eome difficulty and at great risk,

alongside the distressed vessel in charge

ported his ship safe and declined an offer
to tow him to Nagasaki, 210 miles distant,
but asked that the Glenogle's surgeon be
put on board, as the ship's carpenter had
fallen from aloft and was seriously In

several hours with the injured man, ren

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Mr. Leach explained that he had al
lowed Dimmick to pursue his duties from
February 19 until July 31 of this year for
the reason that he had up to the latter
date a doubt us to Dimmick's guilt. Fur
thermore, he nad .given him these months
In which to look for another situation, as
he did not wish by discharging Dimmick
summarily to wreck his reputation and
disgrace him.
"I asked Dimmick for a justification of
these offenses,'' continued Mr. Leach. "I
condemned his methods and told him that
a man who entertained such ideas of pro
priety and honesty in such transactions,
notwithstanding that he might not have
any criminal Intent, could not remain
with me, and he would have to seek some
other position, and that I would give him
two or three months longer to find an
other one. ' I had such implicit confidence
in the man at that time and his plausi
ble stories deceived me to . that extent
that I felt justified in dismissing him In a
manner that would not wreck his reputa
tion or disgrace his family. After I had
occasion to look at the books and found
that he had told me things which were
not in accordance with the record, I let
it go, saying, 'Now we are going to get
rid of this man/ until the matter of the
$30,000 came up. I. wanted to dismiss him
at once, but after a talk with Mint Di
rector Roberts he wanted me to keep
Dimmick in office until we were through
with the Investigation."
The further hearing was" continued until
next Tuesday at 10 a." m. ';>
Doubted Chief Clerk's Guilt.
Superintendent Leach of the Mint was
on the Â¦ -witness :' stand . in- United States
Commissioner Heacock's court the 'whole
of yesterday afternoon under searching
cross-examination : by George D. Collins,
counsel for Walter N: Dlmmlck. 1 The
attorney was inquiring closely as
to /the , manner -of exchanging old
lead for bluestone , " between the
Mint officials and the Selby Smelting
and Lead Works.' Mr. Leach explained
that he had not thought it worth while to
keep a book or a set of books for these
transactions. The bills and other vouch
ers, he said, were kept in envelopes, and
these were indexed.
Â¦The witness called attention to one
transaction of the date of December 30,
1899, on which date DfmmicU collected
$362 47 from the Selby people for sales, and
he did not enter the transaction until
January, 1900, several days later. Â¦ This al
lowed him to carry the " money " into the
next quarter. It should have been paid
hy Dimmick into the Sub-Treasury on De
cember 31, the last day of the quarter.
The proper depository for all such moneys
until the end of .the quarter was the office
safe, which was equally accessible to
Dimmick, the witness, his private secre
tary, the bookkeeper, Mr. Symmes, and
the bank messenger. In that safe were also
kept the duplicate combination- of all the
vaults in the Mint. Dimmick kept a pri
vate box In'the safe there, and so did the
witness. He could not remember ever hav
ing seen any money in the 1 safe, but he
had so much confidence in Dimmick that
he left the matter to him entirely. After
February 19, 1901, on which date the wit
ness began to doubt Mr. Dimmick' a dis
cretion, the witness issued an order that
all moneys received for sales of by pro
ducts of the Mint should be sent immedi
ately upon receipt to the United States
Sub-Treasury by. the bank messenger On
July .31, 1901, Leach delivered a note to
Dimmick, ordering him to hand over his
keys and other official effects to B. W.
Day pending investigation into the short
age in the cashier's accounts.
" Dimmick's Duty to Count Coin.
"That shortage was in the cashier's ac
count?" asked Mr. Collins. -
VYes," replied Mr. Leach.
"Who was the cashier?"
"W. K. Cole."
"That shortage of $30,000 was not in the
accounts of Dimmick?"
"No; not that I know of." /
. "That money was not under the custody
and control of Dimmick?" - . â¢
"Well, it was his duty to count it."
Then Mr. Leach went on to tell how, on
'Friday, June 28, the' evening before the
discovery of the 530,000 shortage, he was
requested by Dimmick to go with him into
the cashier's vault and count the con
tents. " â¢
"Was not that an extraordinary re
quest?" asked Mr. Collins. Â¦ "*
"Yes; it was a very extraordinary re
quest," responded the witness. -
"And you didn't ask him for any expla
nation?"
"No, sir."
"We stepped into the vault and he made
the remark thai there was so much money
on the racks. I counted the racks and
said 'Yes,', and he then looked at the
piles in the vault and said 'There is so
much here,' but I could not count whether
there was or not. Then 'he proceeded to
count the other piles there."
.At this stage of the inquiry United
States Attorney Wood-worth came -to the
rescue of the witness with the objection
that the matter ftad nothing whatever to
do with the charges under investigation,
and Judge Heacock sustained the objec
tion. . .

Northern' Wheat Market.
CHICAGO, Aug. 29.â Disappointment at the
previous failure of the market to respond to
Â¦heavy exsorts and : decreasing visible supply,
together with a lack of outside support, wheat
opened a trifle easier. Trading was light and"
largely for local account, considerable of it be
ing in the way, of closing up , deals, over the
coming holidays. Corn exerted â¢ a powerful in
fluence over wheat and prevented any gainHn
values. December opened a shade to %c lower
at 71%.@71%c. Covering, by shorts advanced
the price to' 7isic, but weakness in corn'
caused a reaction to 71@71%c. The close was
%@%c lower at 71^@71%c.
Liberal receipts, disappointing demand and
the gradual liquidation of September, the un
favorable conditions which have caused a
weak tendency in corn for the past ten days
wjre still noticeable again to-day, and the re
6ult was a declining market. December clos^d
with a loss of ?iÂ©VzC at 56%c.
. Oats opened steady, and. fluctuations were
witnin se narrow limit. December closed %@
Uc lower at 35@3oÂ»ic. ' - -.

NEW YORK. Aug. 29.â Any hope of a re
vival of speculation at this time still further
receded to-day and the business transacted at
the Stock Exchange was about the smallest
of tÂ»Â»e year. The recessions from the best
prices toward the close of the day revealed the
strictly professional character of the dealings
and left the prices near to last night's level.
Yesterday's check to Tuesday's selling move
ment had apparently roused some hope that a
renewed buying movement in force might be
imminent. This ranged thÂ« professionals on
the buying- side and accounted forHhe upward
movement, while the closine out of their ac
counts were equally responsible for the re
action. London was reported a buyer in this
market to an effective degree, considering the
narrowness of the market. This, coupled with
a free supply of grain bills, causjd a further
reaction in the sterling exchange market. The
London money market at the eame time hard
ened appreciably, in part owing to the de
mands incident to the pay day for the Stock
Exchange settlement. Exchange authorities do
not express much expectation of any inward
movement of gold in the early future. Condi
tions in the local money market .continued
practically unchanged. The time money mar
ket is very dull, owing to the disposition of
lenders to keep their funds Â¦ in call loans to
meet any emergency. There was some special
demand at different times to-day for St. Loui?
and San Francisco and Canadian Pacific on
the laree net Â«arnlnsrs reported for July; for
Missouri Pacific on vague expectations of com
ine developments; for International Power on
the large orders for new locomotives; for the
International " Paper stocks on the conditions
reported at the annual meeting: on the Erie
on the hope of the labor difficulties among the
anthracite miners would be avoided, and for
Mexican National. Baltimore and Ohio and
for some other stocks for undisclosed reasons.
American Smelting declined further on rumors
of competition organizing, but rallied sharply.
There was liquidation of Standard Rope and
Twine lEsuee. which broke the price of sixes
4 points and of the incomes 2 points. Central
of Georela first incomes fell lÂ»i. The bond
market otherwise was slightly irregular. To
tal sales, par value, $1,820,000. United States
threes advanced H and the new .fours de
clined \l per cent on the last call.

President Stetson professed not to
know that there is such a man in the em
ploy of the company as Mundell. â¢ But in
quiry in the outer office gleaned the infor
mation that Mundell is a conductor em
ployed on the Cazadero run.
From Mr. Stetson's tone yesterday he
certainly will not relinquish his office as
manager of the road without a severe
struggle. He has been the executive head
since the company's original corporation
in 1S7L â¢ â¢
In the past few years the road has had

The new board is composed entirely of
active newspaper men. Its policy will be
to make the Press Club what it should be
â headquarters for the working newspa
per men of the city and visiting journal
ists. The club is In excellent condition,
with a large membership roll and a good
bank account. Its cozy quarters In the
Press Club building have become the pop

during the summer months. Whether
through mismanagement or through
sheer bad luck, there have been many
railroad accidents. The ferry-boats
used by the company to carry the pas
.sengers and freight, across the. bay have
very frequently broken down. A number
of the stockholders claim that with the
appointment of Mundell to the position
of manager all these accidents will cease.
The railway is on a splendid paying* ba
sis. In the last annual report of the
Railroad Commissioners the road is
quoted as earning $423,123 99. The stock
holders say that by placing in a younger
man as manager, and with a number of
necessary improvements, these earnings
could be considerably increased.
In the meantime hostilities have ceased
until the return of A. Borel, Should the
reform clique meet with victory at the
next stockholders' meeting W. R. Mun
dell will be promoted from an ordinary
conductor to the responsible position of
general manager.

can think differently. The imported coach

After the case had been submitted with
out, argument Judge Greene said It waa
plain to him that fraud had been com
mitted. He then ordered that the deeds
to Finigan's daughters be set aside.
Settlements will be made with Finigan's
creditors now at about 73 cents on ] the
dollar
The trial of i the case went on to-day
after a series of delays extending over a
period of flve years from the time FInigan
asked, the courts of Mann County to de-'
clare him an Insolvent. FInigan has been '
successful in avoiding process servers and
the attorneys for M. F. Cochran, the as
signee., have been unsuccessful in gather
ing evidence. Finigan's daughters refused
to come to his aid, though they might
have saved the property in so doing.
When pressed on the stand to-day Finl
gan admitted that he had transferred the
property in Berkeley, which consists of
two houses and three lots, knowing that
he was unable to meet obligation*
amounting to $8000 or $10,000. He also
made the admission that he made the
deeds over without the knowledge of his
daughters, which was equivalent' to ac
knowledging that there was no considera
tion. His memory served him poorly upon
most of the Incidents relating to tho !
transfers and Insolvency proceedings. He
could not recall whether he handed i the
deeds to either of his daughters, not even
when his own attorney asked him ques
tions concerning the transactions
Assignee Cochran testified that at the
time of Finigan's failure in 1S96 the only
asset he could find praa ownership in thÂ«
FInigan mine In Calaveras County It waa
represented to be worth thousands of dol
lars, but was sold for only $160. Cochran
said he did not ascertain the valueless
condition of the mine until after lie had
sent an expert up to report upon it at a
cost of $200. He had to pay the difference
between $160 and $200 out of his own pock
et, besides many"' other dollars in court
costs.

The sign license tax ordinance, by which
the City Council proposed to raise $17,
000 revenue, has beeifc declared unconsti
tutional and Invalid by Police Judge Atrior
tlmer Smith, who to-day rendered a
lengthy decision sustaining the conten
tions of Walter Meese, a* Washington
stieet merchant, who resisted payment of
the tax.
The chief point upon which his Honor
held against the validity of the ordinance
was that its previsions clearly discrimi
nated as between residents and non-resi
dents who might do business in Oakland
using signs. Judge Smith said:
"There is no question in my mind that
this ordinance discriminates against busi
ness men in this city who erect signs and
non-residents who erect business or adver
tising signs in the city of Oakland. It is
agreed by counsel on both sides that
where an ordinance discriminates in this
manner It is void. It has been held by
the Supreme Court that where an ordl
nnr.ee applies to the residents of a cer
tain county and does not apply to resi
dents of another county the ordinance is
unconstitutional and Invalid.
"You will readily see by reading section
1 of the ordinance that it does discriminate
between those doing business within the
corporate limits of the city of Oakland
and those who are without said limits,
but who erect signs for advertising pur
poses Therefore on the ground that the
ordinance is discriminating, hence void,
the court sustains the demurrer and or
ders the discharge of the defendant."
The objection to the ordinance under
Judge Smith's ruling is that it fails to en.
force the payment of a sign tax from any
person who might maintain a sign In Oak
land but did not reside here.
City Attorney Johnson announced that
no appeal would be taken, but immediate
action would be had to re-enact the sign
ordinance, with the objectionable elements
removed. Opponents of the tax declare
they have many other grounds of attack
which were not touched during the con
test, but will be utilized should another
ordinance be passed. Only $1000 had been
collected under the ordinance which was
nullified by to-day's decision.
Dispatches received from "Washington
to-day by Senator George C. Perkins re
move- all fear that the contract for the
completion of the tidal canal will be held
up bv the War Department. One of the
messages Is from Attorney General Knox,
informing the California. Senator that he
has advised the Secretary of War that
rthe contract cannot be abrogated, while
the other Is from the Assistant Secretary
1 of War, stating that he has Instructed
the chief engineer to go ahead with the
improvement. The dispatches read as
follows:
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 28.
Hon. George C. Perkins: I have advised Sec
retary of War that the Congressional provisions
for Improvement of Oakland harbor are manda
tory, and work ehoold not be euspenfled to

On top of these telegrams advices came
to-day that the Secretary of War has
signed the contracts on behalf of the
Government. The work can therefore pro
ceed without further hindrance. _.;;;
The people of Alameda especially will
breathe sighs of relief when they read the
assurances that the .canal project is to
go forward, as they have been on the
anxious seat ever since it was announced
that Chirman Burton of the House Rivers
and Harbors Committee was trying to
hold up the contract in Washington.
The contract for the completion of the
tidal canal was awarded three months
ago to the Atlantic. Pacific and Gulf
Dredging Company for $233,000. It calls
for the removal of 1,600,000 cubic yards of
earth The contractors began work Im
mediately and had spent efcmcthlng- like
$24,000 in preliminary surveys and dams
when the contract was temporarily held
up and matters came to a. standstill' to
await the action of the authorities at

Mr. and Mrs. Brunns returned home
to-day to face the ordeal. But there
was no ordeal to face. The young groom
went with his bride to her parents' resi
dence, where her father, James Woods,
an old resident of Golden Gate, was wait
ing to meet them. He remonstrated a
bit because they had not taken him into
their confidence. But blessings were
freely showered upon the elopers, and
that was the end of it.
The groom's father, D. H. Brunns, an
old-time merchant of Berkeley, had next
to be considered. With his new father
in-law young Brunns went to the fam
ily residence this afternoon and the situ
ation was explained. Again there were
murmurs of dissatisfaction that the
young man had not confided In his rela
tives. Then the Brunns contingent join
ed forces with the bride's relatives in of
fering congratulations.
There was a celebration to-night at the
Woods residence in honor of the event.
The bride Is a sister to Johnny Woods
and J. T. Woods, the clever jockeys, who
are now riding successfully at Saratoga.-
Mrs. Brunns is 20 years old, being her
husband's junior by three years.

We realize i the financial predicament of the
board and fully appreciate its condition; but in
spite of this we, the students of the school,
petition them to modify a policy which is detri
mental to our own interests and theirs.
Mr. Pond has remained non-committal on the
subject, but it must be extremely 'embarrassing
for an ambitious principal to begin his career
here after the resignation of his most . expe
rienced teachers. . ..,.,.
Oakland,, we may venture to say,, has, In the
past years won the reputation of being: the edu
cational center of the State; and this reputa
tion'has been due to the fact that she has taken
pains â¢ that her faculty should rank among the
highest on the coast. But the recent step taken
by the board in cutting down -salaries of the
teachers has obliged three. of our most experi
enced instructors to leave for more profitable
positions; not' only have some of our best left,
but more are preparing â¢ to leave. The Aegis
does not wish to be presumptuous, but if the
board will allow us a little freedom of speech
we should like -to give an expression of our
fears, for which we believe we have sufficient
ground. . The very fact that other cities are
eager to give positions to our. teachers should
convince the board of their worth to . the
school. ....:...-
When the salaries of the teachers were cur
tailed, followed by the resignation some of
our best instructors,, the members of the school
had anything: but admiration for the board; and
although this feeling of animosity has some
what lessened," we all realize that the progress
of the school has been greatly retarded. In a
way the affair seems to be hardly any of our
business, but the sentiment of the students and
our own realization of its importance will not
permit us to pass over the matter unnoticed. Â¦
The Board of Education has always listened
with respect and courtesy to the requests of the
students, and we believe if we now come to
them in the right spirit they will find no cause
for exceptions.

FOOTBALL TALK
AT BERKELEY
Action on the protests was deferred on
the motion of Wixson â¢ to refer them to
the Council without recommendation.
They will be disposed of at the next meet
ing of the Council.
The Council finally passed an ordinance
to create the position of Assistant City
Attorney to work on the water rates case
appeal.
The License Committee listened to the
protests of many West Oakland people
against saloons run by James K. Dick
inson and J. Bernardo. The._testimony of
several witnesses was- offered in support
of petitions that had - been filed by the
Protestants. - Witnesses â¢ 1 residing 11 ; in 'the
neighborhood of the. saloons .told of their
generally bad reputations.
Rev. J. B. McNally of St. Patrick's
Church addressed the committee. He said
that he had been asked by the men and
women of his parish to use his influence
to have the vice and Immorality that ex
ists in the saloons and their : vicinity
stopped. He insisted that it was the duty
of -the Councilmen to suppress the saloons
that were doing so much, he declared, to
disrupt the morals of the young and un
fortunate.
No Action on Protests.
When it was all over Cuvellier and
Dornln both explained that they had been
under a misapprehension about the sten
ographer's position, because the majority
of the Council had not seen fit to advise
them of what was intended.
"I don't care if you are taller and big
ger than I am. You've been nagging at
me ever since you came into this Coun
cil and there's a limit to things. It's got
to stop now." Â¦Â¦..,.
Wixson reiterated his opinion "of his
colleague, and pale with anger left the
room.
The tall Councilman started for the lit
tle man, who shouted: "You're a liar, a
coward and a tool." Then the blows came
rapidly and Cuvellier landed, twice before
the president and i the other Councilmen
present managed to stop hostilities. 'Â¦ '
As they led Cuvellier away he vehe
mently announced for Wlxson's benefit:
"And I am sincere in this," continued
Cuvellier, addressing Schaffer and Wix
son, who were sitting near in chairs, while
the speaker sat on a desk.
"I don't believe you are sincere," inter
rupted Wixson. Â¦ :i
"What's that?" demanded Cuvellier,
jumping off the desk and walking up to
his tall opponent, who got quickly to his
feet. â¢
Wixson continued to assert his belief,
and somebody said '"Liar." '
Doubt of Sincerity Causes Fight;
"I misunderstood the situation," Cuvel
lier was explaining. "Since then I learn
that Mr. Johnson is satisfied with the ar
rangement and that it .is not expected
that this stenographer shall be an expert
at ?50. Now I want to take back what I
said In that connection. â¢:....
The outbreak occurred immediately
after the adjournment of , the License
Committee, which had been in session in
the main Council chamber listening to
protests against. West Oakland saloons.
Councilmen Cuvellier, Wlxson, Fitzgerald,
Schaffer and Dornln had remained behind
in the chambers while the other members
of the Council had retired to the Clerk's
office to continue committee work. Cuvel
lier and Dornin on one side and Schaffer
and Wixson on the other, end, of the talk
were discussing,! the speech which was
made at the last' Council meeting by
Cuvellier.' when he scored the Council, for
creating the position of stenographer in
the water rate appeal case.
1 With that Councilman B. Cv Cuvellier
jumped from a desk in the Council cham
ber to-night,- and," letting go both fists,
landed heavily on Councilman J.^S. Wix
son, who had started the: epithet-hurling.
The tall legislator from the Second "Ward
made a pass, at his short' opponent and
the two Councilmen started to mix mat
ters, when â¢ President Louis." Schaffer
threw his bulky frame into the breach
and separated tne pugilistic city fathers.
While it lasted the battle .was warm.
As soon as the men were parted, with
cheeks glowing red and trembling from
anger, tney were led away by friends and
Quiet restored: ' - .. Â¦ . â¢ : Â¦ ,..-.

Bryan, past sachem of the tribe, who
was selected as toastmaster, was pre
sented with a rosewood and gold-plated
tomahawk on behalf of Past Great Sa
chem Henry A. Chase as a token of
brotherly love. After an introductory ad
dress by the Â¦ toastmaster â¢ the guest of
honor, was introduced and the - great sa
chem made a pleasing address. While
those at the tables were discussing Â¦ the
good things there was a programme of

our own people and to the people of the

CUBA DAY AT EXPOSITION
AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS
;The latest 'trustworthy reports show the
crop condition about August 1. Excessive
heat and aridity prevailed during the
preceding six weeks, r This. cut off the de
velopment of the grain and unduly, has
tened-maturity. Sufficient rainfall was
had only In the Western 7 and Baltic prov
inces. The winter grains naturally suffered
comparatively little from the weather,
and the. harvest of winter grain will; be
good in the provinces of Kieff," Podolia,
Bessarabia and Kherson, in > some portions
of the black earth district, particularly
the provinces of Chernigoff, Poltava, Vol
hynia, Koursk," in the provinces Minsk,
Grodno, Kovono,- Vitebsk and Smolensk,
in portions of the Baltic territory, in Fin
land and : in a : portion of -the central re
gionl. In the remaining portions of "the
empire the winter grains will'' shade.' off
from below medium to very bad. and the
official report adds laconically that "the
condition of spring grain is below that of
winter, grains." The harvest of spring
grains will be "satisfactory" in the south
west, the Vistula -provinces and portions
of the northwest. It- is bad throughout
the immense southwestern -territory be
tween the Dneiper and the Ural. Percent
age 'estimates have not been given. -.-Â¦
â¢The.: Government already -has. 'begun
preparations for the . feeding of the popu
lation In districts whese starvation is
threatened. By a law adopted some time
ago the Zemstvos, for. district assemblies,
are relieved from all responsiblity in the
matter, the famine relief funds being now
turned /over to the central government.
Agents of the Ministry of the Interior are
engaged in buying grain, though the Rus
sian . press is forbidden to mention the
matter. The precise object of this prohi
bition 1st difficult to' divine. It cannot'be
possible that the Government thinks the
grain speculators can be taken unawares,
and the secrecy , with, which the prices and
the localities of "purchase are invested
can hardly be conducive to economy.
ST. : PETERSBURG, Aug. .15.â The day
on : which the first, fruits of the harvest
were r blessed in- the churches, which!was
celebrated., throughout Russia this week,
must j I have been ( a day j of " mourning . in
many of the provinces.- The outlook . has
grown" worse almeet every/ week during
the last four weeks. -Even vegetables, in
cluding potatoes, have been largely burned
by the scorching heat in some districts.
The approaching winter wilj be one of the
gloomiest 'Russia has ever seen. . Â¦Â¦;'Â¦
Correspondence of - The Â¦ Call.
At the outset of his lecture he said _ he
was going to speak on a rather 1 delicate
subject. That it was very -hard to discuss
the claims of the Anglican church with
out stirring up a certain amount' of bitter
feeling. . Â» *Â¦?'. -Â¦
'."It' -is generally supposed," - he ' said,
"that those; who have left the Anglican
church for the Catholic church are in
clined to be' more bitter than others; that
they assume a certain kind of superiority
and take an unpleasant, delight in snub
bing in. a sort of â¢ a ; sarcastic way those
whom they have left behind. Now, we are
all human and I suppose sometimes that
the perfect satisfaction -that one feels
when he is deliverd , from all the snares
and delusions of the Episcopalian church
will lead him to speak' in such a way as to
make people think that he has 'a- decided
enmity^ for those he has. left behind. in
those errors. Still I am' perfectly sure
that this is not the general spirit of those
who have left the : Episcopalian church.'
They do not feel an aversion for those left
behind. On the contrary they show an af
fection and offer up prayers that those
who are now in darkness may, through
God's mercy, come , into the vxidmirablo
light." * â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦; Â¦ ."---Â¦â¢ â¢.
The speaker set forth the claims of. the
Church of England or t Episcopalian
church. He discoursed Â¦ at length on the
foundations of that church and j cleverly
pointed out the y/eak points. . ' Â¦
In the course of his sermon. he said that
Episcopalianism in America meant relig
ion for. the "upper ten". ; that it was syn
onymous with yachts, drags, fetes and all
kinds of luxury that could only be en
joyed by the rich. He ridiculed the form
of baptism. in vogue- in -that; church." : He
told of how the wealthy man's: child,
dressed in laces, was taken to church and
the priest would dip his finder - into the
holy water and laying it on the child's
head deliver the ceremony of baptism. He
said that one of the foundations "of the
Episcopalian church was the assumed
"Apostolic succession," which is the taking
into the office affected by the death of an
other some one to carry, on his work In- the
church . of God, as a Bishop. : Father
Woods remarked .that this jt was aptly
called "cuckoo succession." Continuing,
he said: â¢ ;
'"Even Episcopalianism is. not hateful to
the converted Episcopalian. There are so
many tenets in it that are so beautiful, so
true, so helpful that I don't think there is
one who has come out of the Episcopalian
into the Catholic church who has not been
benefited by them. Such certainly I must
acknowledge was my case. I learned the
whole sum of Catholie doctrine not within
the pale of the Catholic church but within
the pale of the Church of England. Some
people will say, 'If it taught you the
Catholic' doctrine, why didn't you re
main in that church and enjoy what the
church gave you ?' And I reply, 'It was
not the Church of England that gave me
the Catholic doctrine, but there were cer
tain things that taught me the principles
of the Catholic church. I saw it was my
duty for the salvation .of my. soul to go
â¢totnat communion, from which all- these
doctrines, -all Â¦Â¦ these truths and all these
good books have been borrowed.' "
Rev. Henry Woods, S.J., a, former
Episcopalian -but - now a' Catholic priest 1 ,
lectured last evening. to a large congrega
tion in St. Mary's Cathedralfdrthe bene
fit of the Children's Day Homes.'. His sub
ject was "The Baseless Fabric of a Vision

Lasette, Martin A. ' ' Walter, N. F.It is proposed by the trustees that Dr.
Lawlor shall take charge of the institu
tion September 1. Dr. Osborne does not
propose to surrender control . until his
books are audited. He expects that an
auditor to represent himself and one to
represent the Board of Trustees will make
a careful examination of the accounts.
There are indications that the action of
the trustees will be vigorously resisted
by the supporters of Dr. Osborne.
Dr. Lawlor was originally slated. for the
position of medical superintendent of the
Asylum,' for the Insane at Ukiah, but
something happened which rendered re
vision of the programme necessary. A
place, however, had to be found for him,
and the Glen Ellen billet seemed to the
politicians available. Lawlor was for
merly Quarantine Officer and subsequent
ly became Health Officer of San Fran
cisco.
John Mackenzie, who Is the leader in
the Board of Trustees, is the notorious
hoes of Sar.ta Clara County. He received
nis earty training in politics under Jim
Hea. The institution for the care of fee
ble-minded children was orisrinallv located
In Santa Clara County, near San Jose.
The expulsion of the superintendent,
who has served the State faithfully for
fifteen years, was brought about by a re
organization of the Board of Trustees.
The members of the board are John T.
Harrington of Colusa, Robert A, Poppe
of Sonoma, John D. Mackenzie of Santa
Clara, and H. F. Dugan and Thomas
P. Rooney of San Francisco. The
three last named were ; appointed
by Governor Gage. The institution
is located at Glen Ellen, Sonoma
County. At the brief session of the trus
tees yesterday John Mackenzie of San
Jose was elected president. Without de
lay a motion declaring vacant the place
of superintendent was put through. Col
onel Harrington of Colusa voted with the
majority. Mr. Poppe protested against
the execution of the programme. Dugan,
Rooney and Mackenzie stood for the pro
gramme. The next motion was one elect
ing Dr. W. M." Lawlor to fill the vacancy
and It prevailed. It was carried despite
the opposition of Mr. Poppe. As soon as
the business in hand was dispatched ac
cording to prearranged plans the majority

supplant him- It is said that Governor
Budd. after diligent Investigation and
thorough consideration of the welfare of
the five hundred feeble-minded wards of

â¢would be almost a crime to remove Dr.
Osborne. Â¦Â¦ , :\ 'â¢ Â¦ ; \

o'clock yesterday afternoon, dis

Dr. Osborne was called to the superin
tendence of the institution fifteen years
ago. He is a physician of acknowledged

that the matterfmay- be explained to them If

John R.- Savory ; of 1233 Vallejo street,
the well-known shipping master engaged
in business -at -11 Stuart street, was last
night brutally "iLicaulted- on Leavenworth,
between, Union and Green streets. He was
taken to tlie Central 1 Emergency Hospital,
where ifiwas found that his injuries were
very serious. His nose was'broken, his
face badly battered and up to a late hour
he had not recovered consciousness.
>.'A woman living near; where: he was

North End police station that a manhad
been attacked by a; number of others and
had been left unconscious on the sidewalk.
Near 'the spot where the injured man. was

Inches wide/in inch-thick and about thir
ty inches Ions"' was found: It : was 'cov
ered with blood 'and hair, and was"evi
dently' the : weapon- used in: the assault. V
When- first taken to the hospital/ Sa
vory was able to' tell? his. name and ad
dress and to say- that he had been robbed
of a watch "find chain -and -about %Â» in
cash., -He afterward lapsed into a state
of - semi-consciousness, and " the doctors
are ' fearful that his injuries are * even
more serlcus than his battered head and

Savory is well known in yachting

a member of several yachting^clubs and
takes an active interest , in the

morning. The crime was discovered when
the shop was opened in the morning and
the police were immediately notified.
Â¦ Detectives Reynolds arid Ryan -were de
tailed-on the case, but were unable to find
a single clew. The robbery was the work
of experienced men. There were evident
ly two in the "job." They gained entrance
to the place by. cutting the wire transom
in front/ To do this one of the burglars
was boosted up, and after cutting the wire
crawled through the opening and dropped
to the floor below. His pal followed by
using. the meat hooks outside.
;*As soon as they gained an-entrance the
burglars set about covering their work.
The arc light in the store that burns all
night was extinguished. They nearly
brought -about their own undoing, how
ever, by turning on the switch which
lighted the incandescent lamp in front of
the store. . This light was seen by George
Low, a barkeeper. In a, liquor store half a
block'. away, lie became suspicious and
tried to notify the police, but was-unsuc
cessful.; Â¦ Â¦â¢ : ., :"-,-Â¦ ' ,!â¢ /.â¢
The burglars turned off the /outside
light and then proceeded leisurely with
their, work. They first tore off the handle
of -the safe, and poured powder into' the
hole. ; A fuse was attached, and without
taking the precaution to muffle the sound
of < the! explosion they lit the fuse. The
front | door was : . blown open ; and - the Inner
door was torn off. its hinges and dropped
to the floor. .The burglars i then emptied
the, safe of. its; valuables.; They did -not
stop to place the money and valuables -in

missioned by the present Governor. It is
asserted by responsible men who have
inside knowledge of affairs at the institu
tion that Dugan and Rocney have had no
time to investigate conditions of the home
since they were appointed. The books
ana accounts of the home -are annually
experted by Lou Wadham. The law re
quires that all money received from indi
viduals for the care of patients at the
home shall be paid over to the State.

The Young Hen's Christian Association
has recently determined to inaugurate a
night law school/ should there be a suffi
cient demand among the \- men of this city
for such' am institution. The course will
extend through four years . and the tui
tion fee has -been, placed, at $50. Applica
tions for admission should be addressed to

Night Law School.
Several , sites were considered, among
them the Mechanics' Pavilion, on Larkin
street; the gore lot at Market and Oak
streets and the Fair block at Powell and
California streets. ,"W. L. Cole and Fred
Elliott, representing 1 ! the Market Street
and Eureka Valley Improvement clubs,
pleaded for the erection of the library on
the Mechanics' Pavilion block, presenting
a set of resolutions to that effect adopted
by the club. S. C. Irving stated that the
property could be acquired by the city for
a less figure than that I at which It would
be sold to other parties. Brandenstein
favored the Fair site for purpose or
beauty, but Mayor Phelan . thought the
site should be more central. The building
committee of the Library Trustees also
favored the Pavilion lot and urged that
$600,000 be devoted to the central library
and $150,000 for the branch libraries.
Mrs. Lovell White, president of the Cali
fornia Club, addressed the committee with
a plea that the top floor of the building be
reserved for an art museum.
The committee decided to confer with
the Mechanics* Institute directors at their
meeting on September 7 regarding the pro
posed consolidation of the Mechanics' and
Public libraries: also to meet with the
Fair estate managers looking toward the
acquisition of the California-street site.
The committee then adopted a resolution
requesting advice from the City Attorney
on these Questions:
1. If money is provided In the tax levy for
a site i to cost more than I'iO.OOO. or to be pro
vided by a bond issue, what are the procee<1
lnsrs necessary to be followed in either case?
2. If several sites for branch libraries in dif
ferent parts of the city are to be acquired at an
aggregate cost of more than $30,000 out of th<Â»
tax levy is It necessary to have a vote of tha
people on the question?
3. Can the cHy condemn the leasehold of the
Lincoln School lots? ; -
Supervisors * Boxton, chairman: D'Ancona
and Brandenstein present. Mayor Phe
lan, S. C. * Irving, president of the Me
chanics' Institute; Supervisor Horace
Wilson, who is also a director of the insti
tute, and Trustees "Wise, Lilienthal and
O'Connor of the Public Library were pres
ent to make suggestions for the proposed
site.
The Supervisors'- committee appointed
by the Mayor to select a suitable site for
the proposed Carnegie library met Ia3t
night at the chambers of the board, with'
Inquiry at the-Bureau of Streets dis
closed the fact that General Manager. Vin
ing wrote a-letter recently to Chief Depj:
uty Thomas," in which I the former Â¦ claims
that the, track onTehama street' is .. not
an unused' track 1 , as it .was built in. ac
cordance with the privileges given by the
company's franchise for tha purpose ' of
reaching the Tehama-street carhouse. The
records show- that ..the Omnibus Railroad
Company was granted a franchise on cer
tain streets, including Tehama street, in
1879. , A resolution of December 3, 1834.
gave the Market-streef Railway Company
the right to use electricity on- the streets
covered by the old- franchise, -but- did not
include Tehama "street. â¢ For that' reason
Braunhart holds â¢ that the track thereon
has been abandoned. >' â¢ * - Â¦? Â¦â¢ ...'â¢Â¦.
Supervisor McCarthy/'WlU cite a. second
instance of the Board" of Works' negli
gence in its failure to. require the, removal
of the cable slots on Howard; street. A
general resolution requiring' all abandoned
tracks belonging to .. the Â¦ Market-street
Railway Company to be 'forthwith re
moved was passed' several â¢ months ago.
The big ' corporation has proceeded to
carry 'out ,the; dictates of the Board of
Supervisors,'; but only- at its own sweet
will. Though: the Howard-street line has
been operated as an electric road for â¢Â¦ six
months the cable slots have been removed
only at the lower, end, while the rest, of
the street, remains disfigured..-
Supervisor -McCarthy "says he has been
informed that the reason why. the Board
of Works has not carried out. its plain
duty/ to cause the .removal of -the slots
and the restoration of the Â¦.pavement "to
its former condition is that,the:cable-al
leyways may serve as sewer conduits: in
the future. McCarthy does not- consider
this reason as sufficient and he wilMntro
duce a new resolution again directing 1 the
Board of Works to cause the immediate
removal of the cable slots. *
; The first instance of the Board of
Works' dereliction will be cited by Super
visor Braunhart, who introduced a reso
lution more than three weeks ago order
ing the' immediate removal of the tracks
on Teharna street, between Third and
fourth. The resolution stated that the
unused tracks were a hindrance to traffic
and it was , unanimously adopted after; a
favorable report by. the Street Committee.
Although three weeks have passed since
the ' action mentioned-' was taken, the
Board of Works has not made a move -as
yet to carry out the provisions â¢ of . the
ordinance. Secretary Park said yester
day that the rails would-be taken up-as
scon as teams could be secured, but. he
cculd not state when the" work would be
commenced. Â¦ ; ' Â¦ ... â¢ â¢ Â¦'Â¦'.. -' "
The attention of the Board of Supervi
sors will be called at next Monday's meet
ing to the fact that the Board of Public
Works is ignoring ordinances passed by
the first named body," directing it to-re
move abandoned tracks belonging to. the
Market-street Railway Company.
