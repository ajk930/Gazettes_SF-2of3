BUFFALO, N. T., Sept. 2.â vice Presi

til the physicians of the President issue
a bulletin or give an opinion that the
President will positively recover. To
night; in company with his host, Ansley

During the afternoon he met several of
the Cabinet officers : and Senator Hanna

and composure. Despite senseless re

by secret service, men, he has positively
declined * to ' have â¢ anything like "a guard
near him. One'of his remarks to-day. In
speaking to two laborers who greeted
him, struck a popular chord. They had
suggested that he might be afraid to be
stopped.
But fortunately there has been no such
issue presented on this occasion, and the
"Vice President -himself has been primar
ily ' responsible for the avoidance of any
thought of "the temporary exercise of ex
ecutive functions by him. Nor has there
been any occasion for the exercise of ex
ecutive authority, for such minor routine
matter as *it comes can readily be left

timately associated with the President,
and the latter are warmest In their ex
pressions of the manner in which he has
met every requirement of the situation.
Not for a moment has he permitted the
idea- to be entertained that there was
need; for considering the constitutional
disability of the President and the exer
cise of executive functions which V this
would on him. On ; thfi. .contrary r
'Roosevelt has been one of the most posi

what constituted the disability of ths

"I rejoice to hear that you so happily

The following message has been re
ceived from King George of Greece, at
Fredensbore:
MOKE GOOD WISHES.
"Everything Is all right, and if the Im
provement continues I am to go home
to-morrow."
Senator Hanna was the last official
caller at the house. He stayed only a fe.w
minutes, but during that time had a
short interview with Dr. McBurney.
When he came out he declined to talk,
further than to say:
HIGHLY FAVORABLE.
At 10;50 to-night the lights in tho
mansion, except those dimly shining in
the sickroom, were extinguished, and by
11 o'clock peaceful quiet reigned about the
Milburn home. v On the dark corner
opposite the house soldiers, policemen
and newspaper men kept vigil, however,
sheltered beneath their tents.
The 9:30 bulletin, as was promised, was
to be % the last for the night, and, while
It was brief, attention was called to the
fact that the pulsa was exactly the same
as this morning-lb-and that the temp
erature was eight-tenths of ' a degree-,
lower, highly favorable symptoms.
The police 4 did not' stop wagons from
going by the nearest corner at high
speed. The regular army guard .was not
so particular' about those who passed up
the gnarded street. The newspaper men
did not 'maintain the. quiet that has pre
vailed for the past three days. Even
those who came from the mansion where
the wounded man lies stopped on the
corner to laugh and chat. From somber
foreboding the feeling has suddenly
turned to joyful confidence that the na
tion's ruler is to be spared.
In fact, by 10:30 o'clock to-night tho
entire temper of everybody about the
Milburn residence seemed to have under
gone a radical change.
"I go back to-night because I have the
most positive assurance that the Presi
dent is going to make a rapid recovery."
Postmaster Frease of Canton, a warm
personal friend of the Â¦ President, who
came .to-day filled with anxiety, said to
night:
a 'continuance of the favor
able condition of the President, there
were many indications that the bulletins
were but meager indications of the real
improvement of the distinguished patient.
At 9:45 o'clock Miss McKinley, a sister of
the President;., Dr. and Mrs. Hermann
Baer, the latter a niece of the President,
and the Misses Barber, nieces of the
President, left the house, and, taking car-,
riages, announced their intention of re
turning to their homes to-night.
Abner McKinley accompanied them to
'the station, and to the Associated â¢ Press

"The Â¦ nearest relatives of the President
are so confident of his recovery that they
have no hesitation in leaving."

DIRECTOR
MILBURN
AIISymptomsAre
in Favor of the
Stricken Chief
General Belief That
the Executive Is
Certain to Recover
"I am absolutely confident everything
will turn out all right," declared the Vice
President, and he said he based his in
formation behind the public expressions of
the physicians. So relieved are Secretary
Gage and Attorney General Knox at the
steady improvement that they returned to
Washington to-night feeling strongly that
their chief would recover, but with the
assurance of the physicians that If a
change for the worst should come it would
be gradual and that they would have
ample time to return.
In the case of Secretary Gage there was
also a public reason why he should be at
his post. New York financiers have ap
pealed to him to relieve the situation In
the money market by Increasing deposits
In national banks and he feels that he can
hardly act at this distance from, the scene
if he finds that action is desirable.
DEVOTION" OP CABINET.
Secretary of State Hay la due to arrive
to-night and will remain with - the other
members of the Cabinet at- least for a
day or. two. The devotion of the members
of the Cabinet to their chief is touching.
All desire to remain near him â¢ until
the crucial ' period Is -passed, and Secre
tary- Hitchcock and Secretary Wilson
avow that only absolute and "imperative
public business will induce them to depart
before the President Is pronounced out of
danger. Senator Hanna will also remain
until the physicians give absolute assur
ance that Mr. McKinley.wIll live.
Controller Dawea and some of the other
eminent men connected with the adminis
tration expect to depart, to-morrow or
Wednesday if the improvement continues.
" Vice President Roosevelt has occupied
a peculiarly delicate and trying position
since the event which threatened .the'
President's life, but he has borne himself
throughout this ordeal in such a manner
as to win the admiration and respect of,
all. It has, moreover, added a new bond,
between the Vice President and those in-
MILBURN HOUSE, BUF
FALO, Sept. 9.â "God's
contribution to the Ameri
can people will be 'the
sparing of the President's
life." As the evening shad
ows were falling to-night John D. Mil
burn, president of the Pan-American Ex
position, reverently uttered these words
as he stood before the house in which
the nation's President was fighting so
bravely with death. And all who have
been at the Milburn residence reflect the
view that the battle will be won and the
world's prayers answered. -
Since last night not an unfavorable
symptom has appeared. Every hour has
been a victory. Faith in the outcome
grows stronger and stronger, and hope
mounts until in the minds of some the
danger cf all future complications -baa,
vanished and hope has become conviction.
Indeed, many of the President's friends
geem possessed with a sort of super
stitious confidence in the President's re
covery which nothing but ,an abso
lute change for the worst can shake.
GEADUAI; nuTBOVEMENT/
The basis for the confidence expressed
Is solid. There has been nothing- but Im
provement, gradual but cure. Every
bulletin, every private and public word
of the physicians In attendance,
breathes encouragement. The reports
which the physicians have given out are
facts as they exist from a scientific
Â¦ standpoint, unmixed with Bentimem.
Nevertheless, that the President is not
out of danger is the verdict by all of
them. Neither of them would risk his
professional reputation with a statement
that the President will live. All they
will say is that with every hour the dan
ger of complications from peritonitis or
blood poisoning grows less.
Dr. McBurney, the most eminent of the
physicians in attendance, expressed the
opinion that if the improvement con
tinues it will be a week yet before the
President can be pronounced out of dan
ger and convalescent. And some of the
colleagues like Dr. Mann place the limit
of danger still farther away. The fear
of peritonitis, it can be said, positively,
has well nigh disappeared. At the expi
ration of the seventy-two hour period, at
4 o'clock this afternoon, danger from
that source was almost gone. The Presi
dent himself has been cheerful and ex
pressed confidence in his recovery. To
day he asked for a morning paper, but
this, of course, had to be denied him.
TAKES UQURIK'H ivrFTWr.
-It 1> with some difficulty that ho can
be restrained from talking, and Colonel
M. T. Herrick of Cleveland la auoted as
authority for the statement that he has
spoken at Intervals of several things he
proposed to do In the future. This after-
noon he asked to be allowed to change
his poeltlon and when permission was
given, before the attendants could aid
him, he changed to a position without
pain. . Â¦ â¢ â¢â¢ ...
Mrs. McTClnley saw him again to-day for
a brief visit and Secretary Cbrtelyou was
admitted for tho nret time. No one else
â¢was admitted to see him, although he In
crlred several times who was downstairs.
He was given nourishment to-day In the
form of egrgs beaten In milk. The water,
which has been given heretofore cold, did
not aDDear to agree with him, and since
last night very hot water has been taken
Into the Btomach through the mouth with
splendid results. His bowels moved
freely to-day, which was considered an
excellent symptom. If he continues to
Improve It will be gradual. If he should
grow worse the change In that direction
also probably will be slow. This is the
opinion of Dr. Mann. There will be no
crisis. If he arrives, at convalescence
Dr. Parke expresses his opinion that it
will be three weeks before it will be safe
to move him. It Is expected that the in
terior wounds will heal first. The sutures
of the lacerated tissue were made so soon
after the bullet passed that they are prob
ably healing rapidly. With the exterior
wounds it is a slower process.
OPTIMISM OF EOOSEVEI/T.

dent and the members of the Cabinet .
I would be difficult to overstate.

OAKLAND.
In the first three innings the Dudes
landed on Stricklett's delivery for nine
safe bumps. A few bases on balls aided
the Oakland nine to score seven runs.
Hodson, as usual, twirled cleverly until
the eighth, when the Senators began to
touch up his delivery, and Dr. JJoskiman
was substituted. Op to the seventh the
Legislators swatted safely but four timea,
and only had as many, runs to their cred
it. Sheehan reached first in the eighth
and came home on Courtney's four strike
over the housetops.' Doyle followed with
a single and scored from second on Moh
lef's poor throw Â»to first of Stanley's
grounder.
It wa3 then that "Mother" Lohraan
called in Dr. Mosklznan to save the brood
from being annihilated, but all in vain.
The pills the medico rolled toward the
plate were to the liking of the Senators,
and in the ninth they landed thrice and
scored two runs, which, gave them a vic
tory. â¢ ' - ,." /-'
In their half of the ninth Oakland might
have tied the score had Drennan been in
structed to bunt instead of hitting out.
Streib walked and was advanced to sec
ond on Eagan's single. Drennan sent an
easy one to Sheehan, who threw to Court
ney and then to Ashenbach. doubling
Eagan and the batter. The next man was
an easy out and Sacramento was jubilant.
Stricklett suiked for seven innings be
cause they batted him hard, but when hÂ©
saw there was a chance of winning hÂ»
pitched as he is capable of doing. Arrel
lanes' work in left field was of star order.
He had eight chances and accepted them
all. His running one-hand catch robbed
Ashenbach of a. two-bagger.
Following is the score:
Oakland won and lost yesterday's gam?.
For seven Innings the Dudes had the
game tucked away, and then grew care
less. A costly error by Francks and a
throw to second base by Hansen, coupled
with a home-run hit by. Mr. Courtney and
a long two-bagger by Stanley, turned the
tide, of -fortune toward Â¦ the -Sacramento
team. There was. not an. uninteresting mo
ment in the game. Circus catches, spec
tacular stops and throws and all the oth
er points that go to make jip a brilliant
exhibition were enjoyed by the big crowd.

Chiarini Brothers' young dog White Hat
made 'a good showing in reaching the
final. In this he met The Grafter. The
dogs were slipped to a strong "jack" that
took them straight away upÂ« the field.
White Hat led and did the early work in
the course. He was even in points when
Grafter killed and won the trial.

Grace's official scores, follow:

Both dogs were well backed and great in

of the dogs being so evenly matched. The
Grafter won the course by a single' point.
Later the pair met again, Sacramento Boy
being run as the bye dog against his
former victor. This time the decision. was
reversed, though The Grafter was handi
capped by having run two more courses.

SPLENDID APPEARANCE WON THE PLAUDITS OF THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO LINED THE EN
TIRE ROUTE OF THE PICTURESQUE PROCESSION. \
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Sept. 9.â The news of
the President's Improved condition
had its effect on the celebration
here and to-day both visitors and
natives attempted to crowd in all
the fun that was intended for three days.
The streets were radiant with flags and
bunting. Throngs crowded the sidewalks,
Joking, laughing and bandying repartee.
Brass bands and drum corps marched
this way and that, playing every imagin
able air: people at windows with boxing
gloves attached to strings "soaked" un
suspecting passers by, who, recovering
from their surprise at the unlooked for
assault, stopped to join in^the laugh
against themselves and to watch some
other unfortunate get it. Many additional
hundreds of visitors arrived late yester
day and they lent their efforts; to th,ose
of the earlier arrivals* to keep 1 the pot
boiling. ... .-. , ;^-. :
The grand parade, which was scheduled
to start at 10:30 o'clock this .morning,
was different irom most parades, Inas
much 2s it sot away promptly. on time.
Just as the clock was striking' the half
hour Grand Marshal Edward J. Taafe
raised his baton, gave the signal and the
long line cf Native Sons and" daughters
started on their course, cheered at every
step by thousands of spectators .who
lined the streets along the entire route of
the procession.
As parlor after parlor passed, those on
the siCewalks would spy friends and
accjuair.ta.nces among the marcmng men,
whom they would hail by name, calling
attention to some special object in Â£acn
particular parlor that attracted thej at
tention ana won the approbation of the
crowd.
There were not many floats in the pro
cession, but three that caused consider
able favorable comment, were -those of
the California Ledtes' Band. La Vespera
Parlor and Vendome Parlor.
Beautiful Banner Stands.
Taking the place of the usually great
number of floats were the banner stands.
They were many and beautiful, but the
one that was easily the handsomest â was,
in fact, the prettiest feature of the entire
parade â was the floral banner and stand
of Brooklyn Parlor No. 151 of Kast Oak
land. The background of this magnificent
affair was composed of flowers giving a
white and gold effect, while the letters
wÂ«re in red and blue. It was really a
work of art, and the applause it received
wherever it was seen was hearty end
prolonged enough to compensate those
who assisted in its construction for the
immense amount of labor that must have
foefcn expended. '
Most of the Native Daughters rode In
carriages, but Oro Fina and Buena Vista
parlors had decided to walk, as did also
the Ladies' Drill Corps of La Estralla
and 1- remont parlors. These four bodies
of marchingr women attracted much at
tention and divided honors for excellence
of alignment with the two companies of
the First California Regiment, F and I,
that had come down from San Francisco
to show the natives of San Jose how
Filipino fields were won. Company F was
under the command of Captain J. F.
Eggert and First lieutenant Ben Clancy
Sjid it marched alone wÂ»th that same
*prigrhtly quickstep that tlwee years and
more ago took it up to the walls of
Manila, the first company in an assault
made by an army of 15,000 men. Company
I, "whicii also distinguished itself in the
same campaign, was commanded by Cap
, tain V. Moore.
Make-Up of the Parade.
At the last moment a number of
changes were made in the order of the
parade. Most of these were made neces
sary by the fact that some parlors which
had been expected to come as a whole
eent only small delegations and conse
quently had too few representatives here
to make a proper showing in the pro
cession. The regular order of parade, as
It took place after these changes had
been made, was as follows:
Chief of Police. Mounted
Squad of Police. Mounted.
Grand marshal. Edward J. Taafe; chief of
staff, H. W. McComas; chief- aid. George Y

port many glacial changes in the interior
and near the headwaters of the Copper

known to the, pioneer prospectors, they
say. have disappeared as if by magic.
Bowlders of mammoth size were found
rising from the . lakebeds and where
streams had been appeared rising ground.
The general topography of this section
presented the appearance of a great gla

took place in 1900. â¢ -
Sloan and Hayes, who knew the country,
well, say the changes are so remarkable'
that it was as though they had visited a

GOVELO, Sept. 9.â The body of Pren
tiss^ Hutchinson. the v missing young
huntsman from Oakland, has been found
after fifteen days- of searching- by scores
of men over rough mountains and along
brush lined streams. Â«.
Thomas R. Hutchinson, the father of
the young man, proposed this morning
that the searchers go down Rattlesnake
Creek once more.- All agreed and they
started out. They went down several
miles without success and at last started
back. After ascending the stream some
distance they came to a very rough place
and some started to go around. Mr.
Hutchinson proposed agoing through this
place, &3 he did not wish to leave any
unexplored. He had gone but a few
yards when he was startled by four or
live large buzzards arising from a spot
directly ahead of him. He. pushed on and
soon shouted; '
"I have found my, boy. "Here he is
dead."' â¢ -' ~ *- ;-'Â¦ . . : ..

Everything: indicates that., the young 1
â¢man had gone down to the edge of the
stream", and slipped and fell into the
water.. Stunned by the fall, he was un
able to help himself and drowned in only
a "few inches of water. One shoe had in
some way been slipped from his foot ana
lay close beside him. His hat and fishing
rod tiave not yet been found. From the
worn, appearance of his shoes he must
have traveled some, time and at last
wandered back to .the creek. |
Scores of men hid passed the place
where he was found and failed to see the
body. Experienced men had been on~the
trail for fifteen days and it Is a singular
fact that it was- the father who finally
came upon the body. - - .-
The remains of the young man Â¦will hÂ«Â»

SEATTLE, Sept. 9.â C. A. S. Frost of
Nome has been cited - to . appear before
the United States Court of Appeals in
San Francisco on October 16, to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt. In August, 1900, the Circuit
Court of Appeals Issued its writs of su
persedeas from " San Francisco. These
writs commanded that the golddust in
Mr. McKenzie's possession, under order
of Judge Noyes, be turned, over to the
claim owners. They arrived at Nome last
September.
.'Frost-is alleged to have counseled Mar
shal Vav/ter not to. turn over this dust.
He is alleged to have also advised the
summoning of a posse comitatus to re
sist any attempt to get the dust frpm
McKenzle. At the time - of these alleged
actions Krost .was special examiner lor
the Department of Justice.- It was. his
duty to advise the Marshal concerning
his actions in cases then before him.
Vawter's affidavit states tnat after the
writs of supersedeas/came to Nome Frost
was in the pay of Alexander .McKenzie,
and was using all the means in his povv-ei
to prevent that .official losing the gold
dust which the writs had ordered to be
turned over by him. It states that iKrost
attempted to persuade Vawter, as Mar
shal, to get armed men to hold this dust
at the expense of the United States; that
Alexander McKenzie said . to Vawter,
concerning Frost: "He is as putty in my,

by Grand. Marshal Taafe. who, surrounded
by his staff, looked ; down - from the steps
of the public building- on the gayly attired
men and women as they filed past him. ;
AfterHhe parade'those participating in
It and those who had watched it dispersed
to enjoy one or another of the various
amusements and entertainments that had
been arranged to make the day pass pleas
antly.
The great event of the afternoon was
the reception by the Jocal Native Sons
and Daughters at Turn Verein Hall.
Thousands attended it.
Festival Ends in Revelry.
To-night was indeed a night of revelry.,
Thousands danced the hours of darkness
away at Turn Verein Hall and the. big
ball-room of the Hotel Vendome was
taxed to its utmost capacity.' Not only
was the ball-room crowded, but the
guests- of 'the Oakland" contingent over
flowed into the halls and- corridors, which
echoed with the sounds of. popping -corks
and. merry laughter, while every avail
able inch of space trembled with the
vibrations of shuffling feet keeping time
to the melodious measures of the laboring
orchestra. Â¦' . . â¢ v
. This was without doubt the largest and
most successful function ever given in the
Garden City. The men who were not in
uniform were in evening dress. The
white shirt fronts and gold laced blouses
flitted here and there among the rich
costumes of the women, giving to the
whole scene a blend of oolor that con
tinually changed its tints. with the rapid
ity of a kaleidoscope. . . . - -Â¦ .
The ball was a huge success and.fitting
ly closed the round of festivity that
marked the day. Those who are to be
thanked for the arrangements . that re
sulted so satisfactorily are:H. C. Sage
horn, floor director; W. B. Staudeford,
\V. P. Martin, E. Breling, H. G. Williams*
and J. E. McElroy, aids.
The reception committee was composed

W. \\V H. Gentry. Â¦
Though all the Oakland parlors par
ticipated, Oakland Parlor No. 50 is the
one under whose name the , invitations
were sent out. ,
A feature of both the dance at Turn
"Verein Hall and the one at Hotel. Ven
dome was the number of pioneers who
were present. ' Led by "Pop" . Jerome of
the San Francisco Custom House - and
Judge James G. Boyd of . San Francisco-,
these hardy old argonauts took In all the
sights, and none danced with greater
vigor than' these same venerable beaux,
who remembered the time when the
water crept up to Montgomery street and
one rode bronco-back from San Fran
cisco to this town to attend a fandango
and whisper sweet nothings into the
willing 1 ear of the handsome daughter of
some proud old Spanish Don!
Those who composed the committees
having charge of the arrangements for

McLaughlin and Coombs Talk;
Another star feature of .the afternoon
was the literary exercises at St. James
Park. A number of excellent numbers
were rendered 'and .eloquent addresses
delivered by Grand Orator Charles E. Mc-
Laughlin and Hon. Prank L. Coombs.
In his address Mr. McLaughlin said:

creation.-, man, so should we crown our labors
for the advancement of humankind, with a per
fect, sturdy, independent manhood; ,Â« a .man
hood proudly conscious of its strength and pow

the gratification of individual passions and de
sires; a manhood having no guide but truth,
no shield but right, and knowing no purpose

which shall give this State a wealth of happy
homes, where men shall reign-as kings â men
high-minded and honorable, - brave .and:, true;

and let that reason .teach .them self-control. Â¦Â«,

WHAT CAUSES DANDRUFF.
Greatest European Authority on Skin
Diseases Says It's a Germ.
The old idea was that dandruff is scales
of skin thrown oft through a, feverish con-
dition pi the scalp. Professor Unna, Hain-
burg, Germany, European authority on
skin diseases, says dandruff is a germ
disease. The germ burrows under the
' scalp, throwing up little scales of cuticle
and sapping the vitality of the hair at the
root. The only, hair preparation that kill3
dandruff germs Is Newbro's Herpicide.
"Destroy the cause. , you remove the ef-
fect." Not only cures dandruff, but stops
falling hair and causes a luxuriant
growth. â¢ Delightful hair dressing. . s

i MILBURN HOUSE, BUFFALO, Sept.
9. â Secretary Gage has been appealed to
by aomeof the New York financial Inter
ests to relieve the money market by In
creasing the deposits In national .banks.
Representations are being made that,
while the interior Is demanding- money to
i riove the crops, public funds are piling
up in the Treasury to the detriment of
the commercial Interests of the country.
Secretary Gage declined to state what,
1 ' anything, would be done to relieve the

â¢ CHICAGO, Sept. 9.â United States se
cret service officers in Chicago, having
come to the conclusion that the attempt
ed assassination of President McKinley
was the result of a plot arranged in this
city, have telegraphed to Chief Wilkle of
the secret service, who is now in Buffalo,
asking him to send Czolgosz's coat to Chi
cago immediately. The officers believe the
mark on the assassin's coat will prove
that it was made by a tailor who lived
very Â«near the .house of Abraham Isaak,
one of the anarchists now being held on
a charge of conspiracy. This fact once
determined, the officers say,. it will be a
matter of only a few hours to ascertain
exactly where Czolgosz lived in Chicago,
the names of those with whom he asso
ciated while here and the length of time
he remained in the city. , '
Result of a Plot.
The entertainment that evening was
abandoned, and instead the passengers
held religious services, offering prayers
for the recovery of the President and the
'welfare of the country. The prayers were
Interspersed with singing of . patriotic
hymns.
When the passengers received the start
ling intelligence thero was the utmost
consternation on board, and a great many
were incredulous, believing that they had
not heard the message correctly, and it
had to be repeated. Nothing was talked
of but the awful crime.
"President McKinley was shot at Buf
falo yesterday afternoon; is still living."
The passengers, of whom there were 128
in "the first cabin,- learned of the attempt
to take the President's life when the ves
sel was about forty miles off Nantucket.
As the Belgenland was passing the Nan
tucket lightship, about 4 o'clock, two
short flaps were seen on the vessel dis
playing the letters "B. J.," which means
â¢come nearer; have important informa
tion."
Captain Hill brought his vessel in, -and
through the megaphone came the words:
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 9.â Passengers
and officers of the American line steam
ship Belgenland, which arrived early this
morning from Liverpool and Queenstown,
speak in terms of the highest praise of
the enterprise of the New York Herald,
which enabled those aboard the vessel to
learn of Colzgosz's dastardly crime thirty
eight hours before reaching port. Â¦
When the pilot went aboard the steam
ship at the Delaware Capes late yester
day afternoon with newspapers,- telling of
the attempted' assassination of. President
McKinley at" Buffalo he found that the
news had already b6en carried to the pas
sengers by wiraless telegraphy.

Danger Point Not Past.
MILBURN HOUSE. BUFFALO, Sept.
9.â Dr. M. B. Mann, who has Dr. McBur
ney as a guest, was seen after the last
consultation to-night. He said:
I am gratified at the excellent showing made
by the President and the remarkable manner
In which the case is progressing. I feel that,
although the danger point is by no means
passed yet, every day that goes by without
any unfavorable sign is a distinct and decided
grain toward recovery. I prefer to wait a time
before. rr.akiner any positive declarations on the
subject, although I expect the President will
get well unless unfavorable symptoms develop.
At this time there are no indications of such
symptoms, but on the contrary an entire ab
sence of them.
The President certainly has had a comfort
able day, and there has ben a steady improve
ment all alone: the iine. - There has not been
any unfavorable symptom. No, I cannot say
that all dancer hajs passed, but every hour
that passes diminishes the chances of trouble.
He is very cheerful In manner, a very good
patient and is easily managed. Everything is
going smoothly, favorably and nicely.
"While Dr. Mann was speaking l>r. Mc-
Burney pointed out that violent peritonitis
might have developed, but his opinion now

All Are McKinley Men.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept. 9.â Speaking
to-night at a. mass-meeting called to de
mand vigorous laws against anarchism
and to- express sympathy with President
McKinley Henry Watterson said:
"We must meet the bloodstained hands of an
archism not lnerely with cleaner hands, but
with a purer public spirit, if not a deep
philosophy. We must disseminate the lesson
that government exists not for the private
gain of any, nor for the cure of any private
grief, but for Justice, the citadel and the bell
tower of the public peace and order.
AH of us this night are McKinley men.
We pray this night that God spare his life.
LEAVENAVORTH, Kans., Sept. 9.-
George Braunraider, a member of the
Soldiers' Home, was dishonorably dfs
charged to-night ajid drummed out of the
camp for expressing- satisfaction at the
shooting of President McKinley.
Veteran in Disgrace.
In the present campaign the Democratic party
of Ohio has brought iorward as Its most promi
nent Issue the great national question with
which President McKinley has been most con
spicuously identified and has demanded "the
abolition of the so-called protective system,"
of which he has been the most distinguished,
advocate, seeking to substitute for it as a na
tional policy "the traditional Democratic policy
ot" a tariff for revenue."
If it were not b'ecoming for fidelity to Gar
field and his principles to leave the fight for
a time because the leader was stricken down,
still less is it honorable for McKinley's friends
in his own State to abandon the contest at the
time when his most cherished principles are
brought Into question as the foremost is
sue of this and succeeding campaigns. It seems
to this committee, therefore, that we can best
attest our loyalty to our leader by continuing
our advocacy of the principles which he has
always supported.
If it seems best to your committee to with
draw from antagonizing those principles and to
cease from further advocacy of politval doc
trines which the President has always believed
to be perilous to the prosperity of the entire
country we shall be very glad indeed to be ad
vised to that effect and to have your hearty
co-operation hereafter in the maintenance of
more wholesome public policies. â¢
In any event, and in accordance with the life
long conduct of President McKinley of courtesy
in all political campaigns, our committee and
the entire Republican party will be especially
glad to unite with you in whatever will soften
the asperities of the controversies, eliminate
unwarranted personalities and make the con
test one devoted exclusively to the consideration
of the great principles that separate the two
opposing schools of political opinion. Presi
dent McKinley may not survive, but the prin
ciples for which he stood will live and triumph
if we In the discharge of our duty as citizens
meet every requirement with the same pa
triotism and devotion to principles that have
characterized the life of "William McKinley.
It does â¢ not seem to us appropriate to ac
quiesce In your suggestion that we abandon our
public maintenance of the principles that Pres
ident McKinley represents and which he has
sq often and so ably presented to the people.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Sept. S.â Chairman
M. A. Daugherty of the Democratic State
Executive Committee to-day addressed a
letter to Chairman Charles Dick of. the
Republican State Committee, suggesting
that as an evidence of respect to the Presi
dent all political speeches for the cam
paign In Ohio be canceled, adding that
a similar arrangement had been made at
the time Garfield was assassinated.
To-night Chairman Dick replied to Chair
man Daugherty, refusing to acquiesce in
his suggestion and calling attention to the
fact that, ' while a similar arrangement
had been proposed at the time- of Gar
fleld's assassination, it had' not been ac
cepted by the Democratic State Commit
tee. Chairman Dick says:

Democratic Request.

REFUSES TO ABANDON
SPEECHES IN CAMPAIGN
"There remains to be trampled under
foot an element cf our population coun
tenanced and sustained by an unbridle-.i
press, an unprincipled rostrum, preach
ing the gospel of discontent. I do not say
too much when I assert that this element
delights in condemnationâ aye, con
tempt, for the powers that be."
"Tempering every breath of happiness
at this reunion is the fearful tragedy, of
last Friday," said General Manderson. "I
do not exaggerate when I say that the
example set by you for forty years luis
been one of patriotism. You have
trained your sons to be sons of America,
to know what It is to uphold the flag of
our free institutions.
Ex-Senator Manderson of Nebraska
also sounded the keynote of the encamp
ment at the reunipn to-day of the First
Ohio Volunteer Light Artillery.
"I'll back McKinley's luck every time.
The god of'battles stood by him during
the war. The god of good fortune has
remained with him ever since. He can
not die at this time and under such cir
cumstances."
"Comrades, let us thank God for the
news from Buffalo. The Lord has heard
the uplifted prayers of the civilized and
uncivilized world. Christian, Mohamme
dan, Chinese and all people have unitfd
with us In prayer that McKinley misrtil
be spared to us. That prayer Is an
swered. Blessed be the name of the Lord,
who preserved that great personality
to us." \*
Then, dropping his impressive man
ner, the general said:
General Daniel E. Sickles to-night gave
an expression to a sentiment which is re
flected in the hearts of every patriot
present. Tall and sturdy, as if the
snows of over seventy winters had noc
sifted their powder into his scanty locks,
standing erect on his crutches, he strode
into National G. A. R. headquarters and,
lifting his cap to Commander in Chief
Lee Rassieur and the other dignitar'es,
bowed and exclaimed: . . .
to participate in the annual
exercises of the G. A. R. The
center of the scene to-night was the
Soldiers' and Sailors' monument,,' which
stands in the middle of the public square
in the heart of the city.

William J. Bryan Declares Govern-
BUFFALO, Sept. 9.â William J. Bryan,
to-day, telegraphed 'the Times as follows:
"Free governments may be overthrown,
but they cannot be reformed by those
who violate the -commandment 'Thou
Shalt Not Kill.' Under a Government
like ours, every wrong can be remedied
by laws, and the laws are in the hands
of the people themselves. Anarchy can be
neither excused nor tolerated here. The
man who proposes to . right a public
wrong by taking the life of a human
being makes himself an outlaw and can
not consistently appeal to the protection
SAYS ANARCHISTS
ARE PUBLIC- OUTLAWS
dent right. This morning Assistant
Superintendent W. E. Gilbert; who had
learned of the circumstance, ordered the
acting foreman to discharge Peterson,
and this was done forthwith.
A thorough search of the lodgings of
Gordon and Nold failed to reveal anything
criminating further than a lot of anarch
istic literature. A number of letters were
seized, none having any bearing on the
crime of Czolgosz. No further arrests
were made. It is learned on what is con
sidered, good, authority that the arrest of
the two men â¢was made upon a telegraphic
request from the Police Department of
Buffalo, and that the Buffalo offlciais
have ordered them held pending further
instructions. It is^ also, said that Emma
Goldman has been located at some point
in Ontario, which gives rise to the suspi
cion that she may have been directly con
nected' with the attempted assassination
of the President.. Emma Goldman was in
this city ' Sunday. September 1, and par
ticipated in a meeting of several, anarch
ists at the house of Gordon, on Wylie
avenue. She has visited here frequently
and nothing of unusual interest attached
to her last appearance. At the time she
Â¦was supposed to be here in connection
with the steel strike, but she said she
was only on a short vacation and was go
ing to Cleveland-the next day.
There is a strong suspicion that the as
sailant of the President came to Pitts
burg with Miss Goldman on her last visit.
She came here from Rochester and on
her way stopped at Buffalo, the detectives
who have been tracing her movements
say. There. was in her company a young
man who answered in every. Â¦way the gen
eral description of Czolgosz, except that
the suspect wore a very slight brownish
moustache. This mysterious young man
accompanied the woman from the station
to the house of Gordon..
PITTSBURG, Sept. 9.â Carl Nold and
Harry Gordon, well-known Pittsburg an
archists and intimate friends of- Emma
Goldman, were arrested here this after
noon. Nold 'was a friend of Berkman, who
shot H. C. Frick.
"Was "With, the Assassin.
Not once, since his confinement, either
in talking -with â¢ his guards or* when up
for examination, has he.. asked as to the
fate of his victim. No plan for the ar
raignment of the prisoner has been con
sidered by District Attorney Penney.
It is believed that both Emma Goldman
and Julius Schwab will be detained by the
police whenever they are found. Superin
tendent Bull has made a general request
to the police of the country that any one
suspected of complicity be detained and
examined. The police of Chicago, Cleve
land, Detroit and other Midde States cities
are co-operating with the local officers in
tracing out the movements of the prisoner
before the crime, and Superintendent Bull
said to-day that he had practically ac
counted for. him for the six weeks that
preceded his arrival here. Czolgosz is still
kept secluded and the detectives are the
only ones who have access to him. He is
still strong and healthy and eats with a
will. Knowledge of the condition of the
President is kept from him. He knew on
Friday night that the President was still
alive, but has been given no information
since then. . .
After Goldman and Schwab.
The police have about concluded that
more effective work on the plot theory can
be done on the outside, although Czoigosz
probaoiy will have another experience at
the third degree of police craft to-mor
row. The general investigation of the
case progresses slowly, because the men
on it must cover a large amount of pre
liminary ground before they can do eftect
ive work. According to the local authori
ties the police of the country know very
little about the anarchists. They say that
the secret service men do not show any
special familiarity with them, and that
tnere does not seem to be a single city
Police Department in the country that has
more than a general knowledge of them.
Members of the Buffalo force admit that
they have never given American anar
chists serious consideration and that they
did not know there were any here. Since
the President was shot they have found
that there are fat least twenty avowed
anarchists in the city. Here, as elsewhere,
it has been necessary for the detectives to
first satisfy themselves as to the identity
of a lot of men whom they never had oc
casion to watph before. No other arrests
have been made in connection with the
case, and the local police say that they do
not anticipate any at present.
TMrd Degree in. Store.
. "added anything : material . . to
their 'knowledge of the case. The -chief
effort of the detectives was to draw from
the prisoner some admission as to ., his
accomplices, but he persistently stuck to
his denial that he was assisted in any
way in the -commission of the crime.
Every possible device was resorted to in
the effort to obtain the information, but
the prisoner, maintained 'his position and
could not be shaken: In answer to ques
tions he again wenb-over the events of
Friday, and Â»told substantially the same
story as in the original euiiiession mauc to
Superintendent iiuil and District Attorney
Penny.
Czoigosz carefully weighed his answers,
and wnen conclusions that he did not ap
prove were taken from his statements In
sisted upon making explanations of his
exact meaning.
BUFFALO, : Sept. . 9.â Czolgosz,
the assailant of President Mc-
Kinley, went through another
long examination' to-day: at the
hands of the police officials, but
â¢ emerged from it without having
of the Government which he repudiates.
He invites a return to a state of bar
barism. In which one must at his own
risk defend his own rights and avenge his
own wrongs. The punishment admin
istered to the would-be assassin and to
his co-conspirators, if he have them,
should be such as to warn all inclined to
anarchy that while this is an asylum for
those who love liberty, it ' is an inhos
pitable place for ! those who raise, their
hands against all forms of government.
""W. J. BRYAN."
Long Is Confident.
BOSTON, Sept. 9.â On his arrival hera
to-night from Buckfield Secretary Long
said that he had not decided when he
would go to Buffalo. He went to his
home in Hlngham to-night. Secretary
Long in an interview said:
From the first advices I have felt confident
that the President would recover. There seems
to be no occasion for considering the question
cf who will act In caas of disability; there
evidently is to be no disability.
I am not prepared to say what kind of legis
lation should be had In dealing with . this
class of crime. That whole question is moat
intricate. In each individual case the course
of the law is plain.
THE SATST FRANCISCO CAI/L,: TUEfSDAY, SEPTEMBER^ 1O,- %P9*k
Dr. Eugene Wasdin, who was with Dt. Mynter, said:
"I, too, am averse to making predictions, but X agree that
the President's condition is one that strongly favors complete and
rapid recovery.' 1
' "I have always made it a point not to prognosticate in serious
cases, for you know man proposes and God disposes. I consider the
President's case a serious one, and so I do not predict, but I may
say that at this stage the condition of the patient is remarkably
favorable, and personally I cannot expect anything except re
covery." Tv"**v- Â¦
"I am not a specialist in abdominal surgery, but from a gen
eral knowledge of gunshot wounds, I can say that the only possi
bility of complications would be by. blood-poisoning or peritonitis,
and that I consider both now a very remote probability. Peritonitis
might set in as a result of the two apertures in the stomach, but
up to tlils time, a time beyond the usual standard record, not the
slightest symptom is manifested. There is not the slightest evi
dence of blood-poisoning. As the bullet is not yet extracted, I do
not think wo need worry about thatl The presumption is. that it is
lodged somewhere in the muscles of the back. Pursuing natural
courses, it would now be cut off.fiom possible harm. There should
be no attempt to extract the bullet at present. Neither will there
be any operation for its removal at this time. I see no reason why
the President will not recover rapidly."
Dr. Hermann Mynter, -one" of the consulting physicians of
President McKinley, said to-night: -
MILBTJBN HOUSE, BUFF AÂ±O, N. Y., Sept. 9.â Dr. P. M.
Rixey, one of tfie President's attending physicians, and
also the private physician of President and Mrs. McKin

As is^well known, the purchase of these islands has'
been under consideration , ever since the Presidency
of Lincoln. At that time Mr. Seward, Secretary of
The argument for the purchase, of the islands is
directed mainly to the advantage they would give us
in case of war with any first-rate naval power. They
have little or no value commercially, industrially 'Â¦' or
financially. There are only three of them, and in the
aggregate they contain \ but 223 square miles. The
population of St. Croix, the largest of the group, is
about 20,000; St. Thomas has about 15,000 and St.
John barely 1000. '
There is of course a good deal of diplomacy yet to
be carried on in connection with the affair. Govern
ments cannot buy islands as easily as, private citizens
can buy railroads, and before the sum of $3,500,000
is turned over to Denmark and we take formal pos
session of the group. there will have to.be expended
much more time and energy than was required to
organize the famous billion dollar steel trust. When
the diplomatists have arranged everything the Sec
retary of State will inform the President and he will
inform Congress and. ask an appropriation to carry
out the bargain. It is probable there will be some
opposition to the purchase when it comes before Con
gress, but it is not believed the treaty will be de
feated. A report from Washington says the State
Department has been guided in the conduct of the
affair by the advice of the Senate Committee on For
eign Relations, and consequently it is expected the
Senate will sustain the treaty. , â¢
WHILE there has been no official announce
ment of an agreement on the part' of our
Government for the purchase of the Danish
West Indian islands, it appears fairly certain that such
an agreement has been reached. The dispatches of a few
days ago from Copenhagen announcing that the new
Danish Ministry had decided to accept the offer of
the United States to pay $3,500,000 for the islands
have not been denied, and Washington correspond
ents have obtained from the State Department no
expression on the subject further than the announce
ment that the report of the action of the Danish
Government will have to be verified through diplo
matic channels before our Government can take note

RENT â L. L., City. If a man owes rent
in any amount and it is on a verbal agree

sends a collector after the delinquent does
not prolong the life of the debt:
The ' arid States show the least- timber, which ex
hibits the reciprocal 'â¢elation between forest and mois
ture. Forest fires'are given as the most potent agent
in reducing the timbered area, and the arid States es
pecially have the greatest interest in preventing them
and in. reforestation of the area they have stripped.
In the, area of forest land California is credited^ with
44,700 square miles, and is exceeded by Texas with
64,000,- Arkansas with. 45,000, Minnesota with. 52,200,
Washington with 47,7oo, and Oregon, with 54,300. In
percentage of their area covered by forest Arkansas
with 84 and Maine with 79 per cent lead all the States!
The percentage f or \ California , is 22. The practically
treeless States are North Dakota with only 1 per cent
of. her area forested, South Dakota .3, Nebraska 3,
Kansas 7 and Nevada 6. '
Inthe statistics of the use^of trees firewood heads
the list, the consumption for fuel being put at 180,
000,000,000 feet board measure. Of course most of
this, however, is timber undersized for use as lumber
of. dimension timber, and some of it is the waste of
lumbering operations. in limbs, and trunks that prove
unfit for sawing upon being felled.
V Such, statistics should be the result of actual in
spection, and no other can be more than approxi
mate. jThe danger of incorrect statement of the forest
area is that it cools the zeal and effectiveness of those
who are trying -to* arouse public opinion to the ne
cessity of forest preservation.;,
A STATEMENT of the forest area is published,
apparently upon the authority of Federal stat
istics, which shows that 37 per cent of the total
area of the United States is covered by forest. We
are inclined to question the figures. Mr. Brown,
secretary of the Indiana Forestry Association, seems
to have es-tablished the error of official statistics on
that subject in his State. He believes that the stat
istics are made by subtracting from the total are,a the
lands devoted to agriculture and assuming that the
remainder is forest. This method would be ob
viously erroneous.

Still more notable of the change in Southern sen
timent on the subject was the recent conviction in
Alabama of a member of a mob which had lynched
a man. That, in fact,- is a clear evidence that juries
are no longer in fear of lynchers, nor in sympathy
with them. A few cases of conviction and heavy
punishment of persons taking part in the outrages
would go far toward putting an end to the barbarous
practice, and fortunately there is now reason to hope
such convictions will be forthcoming. We have prob
ably seen the worst of the evil. The better elements
of the Southern people have been at last awakened
to the appalling menace to their civilization contained
in the repeated outbursts of lawlessness and cruelty,
and have resolved to put a stop to them.
Bishop T. F. Gaylor of the Protestant Episcopal
Church of Tennessee recently preached upon a lynch
ing in Franklin County, where he has been living
for nineteen years, and after describing how "a mob
of frantic citizens, scorning the law and the dictates
of reason, dragged the murderer to the scene of his
crime, and, with 2000 men, women and children to
witness and be degraded by it, burned the criminal
to death and yelled at his torments," he added:
"Every man and woman in Tennessee is responsible
to a greater or less degree, but still respon
sible, for this public defiance, of the decen
cies of civilized life. Are we a Christian peo
ple? Are there any churches in Tennessee?
Surely no Christian consented to. such a mad exhibi
tion of base passion. This is not satire, but an ap
peal to Christ, and to the men and women who be
lieve in Christ, to every minister in this State who
preaches the gospel of the love of Christ, an appeal
for the creation of a public opinion that shall rec
ognize the folly, the inevitable ruin of lawlessness and
the moral degradation of wanton' cruelty."
The ministers of the churches have taken a noble
part in developing a better sentiment among the peo
ple. They have not shirked any phase of the issue,
nor have they dealt with the question in an abstract
way, or with reference to instances of outrage oc
curring in other States. On the contrary, they have
spoken directly of offenses committed near their own
homes, and have emphasized the responsibility of the
better classes of the South in the worst of the out
rages.
To hardly any question did the Alabama constitu
tional convention give more earnest consideration
than to providing means for the suppression of
lynching, and the removal of officers of the law who
consented to it, or even surrendered a priso'ner to a
mob under any circumstances. The 'best speech made
in the convention was that of ex-Governor Jones on
that subject, and it is gratifying to note that he car
ried the convention with him.
EVIDENCES of a revolt on the part of the in
telligence of the South against the domination
of lynch law are becoming more frequent and
more conclusive. The better class of Southern men
are no longer offering excuses for the outrages- or
even passing them by in silence. Leader after leader
in politics, at the bar and in the. church has spoken
out bravely against the wrong, and public sentiment
is rapidly forming on their side.

Dr. Osborne, ever the gentleman he . is,
made the change of administration as
pleasant as possible. He showed every
possible courtesy to the new superintend
ent, and did his best to keep the wheels
of the institution going in the same old
way. He had the interest of his children
at heart and did. nothing whatever to
make manifest to them the new order of
things.. He would make any sacrifice for
these poor "unfortunates, and because of
them he facilitated the change rather
than retarded it in any way.
In spite of all the talk, however, we
have lost Dr. Osborne and the "political
hack" is feathering his nest. ' .
The press, regardless of political faith,
has been roasting him, and politicians all
over the State have been, hurling no
comely invectives at him. As \ for the

In fact, if all reports be true the situation of the
wine producers of France is really serious. The bul
letin des Halles, one of the foremost agricultural
journals of the country, is quoted A as saying: "It is
best, in fact, to tell the truthâ namely, that unless
we are able to compete successfully with the Cali
fornia exporters of wine we had better go out of the!
business and try how the soil. will grow wheat and
sugar beets." â¢Â¦- \- : Â¦: Â¦:Â£?&] -* . .â.:â¢;. â¢;Â¦-.- -.:Â¦:'Â¦ Â¦ r ,.;...
r These reports from IFrance have a pertinent bear
ing upon the 'reciprocity treaty which' Mr/ Kassbn
negotiated with France. It v is the'purpose of that,
treaty to lower the duty on French wines, imported
into this country, and were the treaty ratified the"
French would doubtless dump a large part of their
surplus stock upon the United States. We have,
therefore, a special reason for watching' with care
every sort of reciprocity treaty which may be sub
mitted to the Senate. The Eastern people are not*
particularly interested in .protecting the wine indus
try, and California must look out for her own.
Facing the perplexities of a too abundant crop,
the French naturally turn to their ally the Czar in
the hope of obtaining from him a better market for
their wine. They claim that if the Czar is, really a
friend of France he ought to abolish the duty which
now weighs so heavily upon the wine industry. It
is _not exactly pleasant to have to ask favors of a
guest, or to insist in talking business to a ruler who
comes for the purpose of having entertainment,
neither does it sound altogether proper' to say to a
friend, "Prove your friendship," but in the present
condition of the wine industry in France it appears
the wine men feel that in the reception they are going
to give the Czar if will, be the part of wisdom to
take council of their needs rather than of their'hos
pitality. ':
The cause of the movement is Uhe extraordinary!
wine crop that is now maturing. .One of the members

But the Inability of the Examiner to assume and maintain
a genuinely patriotic attitude is fully exhibited, even in Its
issue of Monday. It had been urged at Buffalo that, for the
present ; at . least,, no undue prominence be given to the
anarchistic tool by whose hand the President was shot. The
answer of. the Examiner to this request is the conspicuous
publication' of a- picture 1 of the assassin, made up from a
description of his person, in which he is depicted with the
intelligence and firmness that might have characterized the
face of/ Brutus. Editorially, as a remedy for anarchy, the
Examiner .proposes to abolish Presidential receptions and the
custom of shaking hands,- and to analogize the representatives
of seventy-five'millions of Americans to an European monarch.
E?DITOR SAN FRANCISCO CALL: The efforts of the
Examiner â¢ to outdo its ' contemporaries in its eulogies
of President McKinley is gratifying. It furnishes
an /instructive contrast when laid side . by side
with its shameless invectives and criticisms, which were
printed even when' the President was here and when the
Examiner, in its editorial columns, was pretending to imitate
'the conduct of a gentleman. It is certainly beyond dispute that
its present obsequiousness is hypocritical, but "hypocrisy is
.the, defense that vice pays to virtue" and, in this instance, it
also illustrates an enforced submission of public opinion,
which, however, is too intelligent to be deceived.
tltes of men, to the exclusive patronage of the low, degraded
and un-American elements of the population, to _ which t
caters The next step toward a cure is to expose, whenever it
is possible, to punish and to deport anarchists fronrthe United
States The third and equally important remedy, because like
the first it goes to the root of the disease, is to prevent the
SmSratlon of the anarchistic class. Upon this last point the
suggestions of Senator Depew. with some additions are excel
lent Every American Consul throughout the world should be
a Commissioner of Immigration, and no man or woman propos
insr to settle in the United States should be allowed to land
at any American port, unless registered abroad, with full
details of name, age, occupation and nationality, from three
to six months before departure, and not then unless indorsed
bv the Consul, at least as to character, perhaps as to intelli
gence through an official certificate and as the result of
investigation. The world, and especially this country, is full
of societies into which admission can be procured only upon
application and proof of qualifications. This republic offers to
immigrants of the right quality unequaled advantages and Is
as much entitled as private organizations to the exercise of
discriminations in selecting materials for residence and
Even anarchists have their legal rights, and, in suppressing
their diabolical iniquity and systematized efforts for the
destruction of government, everything should and will be done
decently and in order. But Congress and the States should
promptly co-operate to frame and perfect the legislation that
is imperatively needed. AMERICAN.-
San Francisco, September 9.
Strives Editorially to Act With Decency Toward the Suffering Executive,
Whom It Has So Persistently Traduced, but Its Hypocrisy
* Wiir Deceive No One. *:.? ;
Treason is a crime against the majesty of the law,
and not the majesty of the person. The criminals who
attack honest laborers in this city, and beat and rob
them, are simply privates in the army of traitors of
which the assassin who spells his name in consonants
is the major general. Yellow journalism is the kin
dergarten and university, in which all thtse enemies
of Americanism are schooled. Close that schoolhouse
and the cure of the disease will have begun. ' \
The bilious sapheads, with bulbous foreheads, who
use their coated tongues and fetid breath to inform
workingmen that they are "wage slaves," and their
employers are their masters and their enemies, are
enemies of Americanism. The educated tramps and
loafers, from Bellamy to Gronlund, who never
earned nor paid wages and are incapable oi' self
support, are all enemies of Americanism. The
banded organizations which forbid to American-born
boys the privilege of apprenticeship and the right to
learn a trade are the enemies of Americanism. All
of these whining, lying, loafing elements, made up
largely of men who have not the energy to earn their
bread by any kind of work, and who spend their time
dreaming of a state of society in which what others
earn will be divided' with them, are inimical to our
country and the welfare of its working people. ' They
are the influence which makes assassins of Presidents.
A wholesome American spirit declares that this coun
try shall be made safe for the President and the hum
blest citizen by the same law, with no partiality for
one over the other.
Under these circumstances the imported labor lead
ers who incite discontent and disorder, who act as
lords of the fate of labor and command it to work or
lie idle as pleases them, are the enemies of American
ism. Every man who runs with a mob to call an
American a "scab" because he chooses to work with
out, enlisting as a bond man to such leaders, and to
beat, bruise and kill him for standing on his Ameri
can birthright to labor, is an enemy of Americanism.
Men are thinking of what it means when one of these
leaders, "business agents" and walking delegates in
Sacramento, on hearing that the President was shot,
said, "I am glad of it; it ought to have been done
when he was in San Francisco." That man is :. a
leader, with the power to order men to stop work
when they have no grievance against their employer,
and to command them to kill other men who are will
ing to work and take their places.
The United States to-day- offers the best oppor
tunity for man that he has ever had. This was so
when we were colonies and Adam Smith, in his
"Origin of the Wealth of Nations," admitted the
larger wages and superior opportunities open to labor
in America in 1776. From that original condition of
advantage we have gone forward, this country be
coming more and more the best in the world for a
man who wishes to thrive by his labor, until to-day
labor commands the highest wages and its wages the
most of the necessaries of life here. , .. T
Taking advantage of our freedom in this country
we have been invaded by enemies of Americanism
from abroad who have found allies here in the reptile
class of the American press.
Anarchy is the flower and fruitage of every misrep
resentation of our economic conditions, and. of every
lie about man's opportunity in life under our form of
government The scum oh the pond roots in the pol
lution of the water by the cryptogami that grow be
low. Anarchy and murder exist by cryptogamic fertil
ization. It is useless to plan reprisals by filing sharper
the law's teeth and protecting the person of the Presi
dent by special enactments and laws that make bat
tery upon him high treason. Such laws will do no
good. The anarchist does not fear death. Repres
sive statutes do not deter him. He can be abolished
only by dcing away with the incitement that acts .as
rennet to curdle the passions of his base mind. â¢
A DASTARDLY crime like the attempt to mur
der President McKinley is like a' flash of light
ning at night which for a moment lights the
scene and discloses its details. The flash of the assas
sin's pistol illuminates the causes at work in this coun
try to destroy our democratic institutions. Such lying
and anarchistic journalism as Hearst practices is a
sort of grand hailing sign and password, grip -and
shibboleth for all the enemies of Americanism.

Every effort is being made to expedite
the discharging of the salmon fleet. The
bark Fresno is discharging a considerable
portion of her carsro into the Ventura at
the Pacific street dock. -When the Ven
tura receives all the salmon her manifest
calls for 12,000 cases will be put aboard
the City of Puebla. The salmon will be
landed on the Pacific street dock from
the Fresno and trucked to the City of
Puebla at the Broadway dock. By this
means the non-union men will be enabled
to work inside an inclosure and will not
require police protection; as would be
necessary, if the flsh were hauled In drays.

Resolutions will be submitted demand
ing a settlement of the trouble on the
basis of a complete recognition of the
Brotherhood of Teamsters and the
power of that body to settle all disputes
between the employers and employes. It
is quite likely that this proposition will
provoke a stormy debate. It was stated
yesterday that the more conservative
members of the association will make
great efforts during the day to secure a
sufficiently large turnout to prevent the
dissatisfied minority from perfecting its
plans to rush through at a special meet
ing propositions which It would be im
possible, it is alleged, , to carry at a regu
lar meeting of that body.
The plan outlined for to-nig-hCs meeting
is to adopt resolutions calling upon the
Employers' Association to confer with
commltte.es of the strikers and arrange
for some basis of settlement. That a com
mittee will be appointed to confer with
the employers relative to the matter is a
foregone conclusion, unless.lt should
happen that the members who are averse
to mixing up in the strike should be in
the majority. In any event, the proceed

WASHINGTON, Sept. 9.â Under date of

the most disastrous Hoods are prevailing

understands that they are the worst
known by Europeans in that valley. All

and Kiu Kiang are to a large extent under
water. The farms, especially in the rice
gTowing region about Wuhu, are so com
pletely flooded that there is no hope for the
crop this year. In addition to tills thou
sands of lives have been lost and un
known numbers rendered homeless by the
overflow. The stoppage of trade is "very
serious. The destruction of the crops in

loss of the rice crops In the district of
Wuhu. the great rice producing center,
will add famine to the other difficulties

Salmon Fleet Vessels.
Special Efforts Made to' Unload
NO HOLIDAY ON WAITER FRONT.
"We have the situation, thoroughly In
hand. rThere are all sorts of rumors afloat
about the ease with which men can be
secured to take the places of the strikers,
but there Is -little If any truth in any of
them. We have representatives- of the In
ternational Sailors' Union all over the
East, and if the shipowners here were
meeting with any success in the efforts
to get nelp we .would know of it.
"After December 1, if the struggle lasta
that long, they may be able to get a few
men from the lakes, but the number will
be so small that it will hardly pay to
bring them here. ;
"A number of the men who have been
brought here by the shipowners are now
members of the union.: Last week we
added thirty names to our list and to
day we have added two. Not all "the
sailors that went out on strike are now
on . the 'beach.' A great many of them
have gone out as deepwater sailors. We
do not bother about the deepwater ships
and do not try to prevent them going. I
have seen 1200 sailors leave this port in
two rponths. so there is very little fear of
a surplus of sailors after, the strike is
settled." v u' "-i- "
Sailors Not Coining From East.
"We are being strengthened every day
by large additions to our strike guard.
The arrival of the fishing fleet from
Alaska means that we are $6000 richer, as
the men who come into this port on these
vessels are all In arrears for dues and
have. plenty of funds with which to pay
them. A great many of them will go
away to the country or. go home to Eu
rope until the commencement of next sea
son, so that they will be no expense to us.
I think we have decidedly the better of
the situation. Compare the statistics of
August a year ago with the figures show-
Ing the" amount of Â¦ business, done last
month. Up at Port Costa only about 20
per cent of the usual amount of work is
being done, while here, on the front not
more than 10 per cent of the work to be
done is being accomplished. And this
work is costing a great deal more than It
would under ordinary circumstances. It
la true that a number of vessels have suc
ceeded in -getting*. out and I expect that
a great many others will get out. but
the number Is so small that we are) not
dismayed. Take the cases of the ships
that are coming into port. It now takes
two weeks to unload a vessel that before
the strike would be unloaded in three or
four days. Steamers that arrive and de
part usually inside of four days have to
stay here ten days before they can make
another trip. â , -
Furuseth in discussing the situation
said yesterday: "1 am very" well satisfied
with 'the conditions as they exist at pres
ent. The men who are out are as strong
in their determination to win as they were
six weeks ago. when the strike com
menced. Not a man Is 'squealing.' There
are no signs of any weakness displayed,
and if the difficulty la not settled In an
other six weeks you will Hnd them every
bit as firm. And let me tell you right
here that when you hear that the strike
Is wearing itself out the 'wearing out' will
not be seen on the union side.
Furusetli Well Satisfied.
The other contingency is attempted In
tervention by the Merchants' Association.
While some have expressed the belief that
the association would urge upon the em
ployers the desirability of settlement,
even if some concession be necessary, the
strike leaders themselves are not expect
ing such course to be taken. Andrew
Furuseth regards the Merchants' Associa
tion and the Employers' Association as
being the two phases of a Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde existence, and he does not hope
that the one will bring pressure to bear
upon the other. Â¦
ADMISSION day was not a holiday
on the water front. On all the
docks gangs of non-union men
were busy handling cargoes. In
the wholesale district there was
an almost entire cessation of work, and
the headquarters of the opposing leaders
in the industrial controversy were practi
cally deserted.
To-day will bring a. return of activity
In the two camps. There will be meetings
of the executive committees of the Em
ployers' Association and the Draymen's
Association., and ,to-nlght ...the,, Merchants'
Association will meet tcrdisciiss the strike
situation. The strike leaders, who have
been directing their efforts toward secur
ing a conference with the employers, will
watch the results of these meetings with
eager expectancy. They have hope, that
one at least of two, possible steps will be
taken. The draymen will consider fur
ther the terms of peace proposed by the
mediators from the Municipal Federation
of Improvement Clubs, and their accept
ance of the terms would be good news
to the teamsters. Few, however, even of
the most sanguine, expect such action to
be taken.

RICHARD BARKER.
In the Interest of fair play and justice I cannot permlt-a-gentle
man and a patriot to be slandered in the: columns 'of your news
paper without correcting it. Very respectfully;
During the wars with Spain and the Philippines six members of
the National Guard of California* who were in 'Mr. Spreckels' em
ploy, enlisted for the Government and the war. Mr. Spreckels kept
their names on his pay roll and every one of them drew $25 per
month from Mr. Spreckels during the time of his service. After
returning from the war he procured a situation for each one of
ihem. â¢ " â¢ :
There was no teaming of any kind done from the refinery dock
and no possible excuse for a strike five weeks ago. Last week every
one worked on Monday; on Tuesday morning- the stevedores came
and took the hatches off. when the walking delegate came over and
ordered the men to stop work. The stevedores put the hatches on and
left the dock. That, of course, threw over 600 men out of employ
ment, and only eleven men had anything to do with the union. Since
then, I see by the papers, one of the number went back to work and
has been beaten nearly to death: another, a machinist, who had been
steadily In the employ of the company for twelve years and never
belonged to any union, has been beaten nearly to death, and other
brutal tactics too numerous to mention. Â¦ "* ..-.-.
Now. if the devil is entitled to his due, surely a public-spirited
American gentleman Is entitled to his due. I have worked a por
tion of every year for the past fifteen years In the employ of Mr.
Spreckels, and I brand every statement against J. D. Spreckels In
that statement as exactly opposed to the truth. The Spreckelses have
always and still are paying voluntarily the highest rate of wages
that are paid In San Francisco. At the Western Sugar Refinery
there are from 600 to 900 men working; there has never been onÂ«
Chinaman, or Japanese worked there: there has never been a union,
and yet I never heard,any one complain about the rate of wages.
During all the hard times of â¢ the Cleveland administration .when
every one else sent laborers" wages down, Mr. Spreckels kept his
men's wages up. There was only one union connected with the
whole arrangement and that was the Stevedores*, only recently or
ganized, numbering about eleven men... They discharged the sugar
from the ships on the dock: they were paid 50 cents per hour for
nine hours' work; overtime, they were paid 75 cents per hour. They
had no grievance and were entirely satisfied with their pay.
Editor Daily Morning Union and Herald: In this morning's edi
tion,of your esteemed paper there Is an article written by G. 'vT.
Lindsay, asking that the boycott should be placed where It belongs,
and after expatiating on consistency and fair play and giving the
devil his due starts In with ;i tirade of abuse against J. D.
Spreckels In the following language:' "J. D. Spreckels is directly
interested in bringing labor down to the lowest standard; he Is di
rectly Interested in seeking cheap Asiatic labor as against free
American labor; he is one of the men who deserves the condemna
tion of organized labor." Â¦ .' .
He is one of the men who deserves the condemnation of organized
labor and his newspaper is the one that should be boycotted by
every man who has the laborers" Interests at heart. But It remains
to be seen. Will It? Tours respectfully, G. W. LINDSAY.
â Grass' Valley Union and Herald. September 6.
John D. Spreckels is directly interested in bringing labor down
to the lowest standard. He is directly .interested in seeking cheap
Asiatic labor as against free American labor. He Is only one of
the many enemies of organized labor who would sound the death
knell of labor unions were it in his power.
On 'the other hand, the San Francisco Call, under the present man
agement, has always defended "scab labor" and always will as long
as It Is under the present management. There is no instance where
a controversy has arisen between capital and labor that 'The Call
did not take the side of capital.
The editorial columns of any paper Is the place to look" for the
expression of that paper's policy and Its attitude toward any move
ment or any class of Individuals.
It is not for me alone to judge whether or not the Union and
Herald has Injured the cause of labor by printing the advertisement
In question, but I can state, without fear of contradiction, that dur
ing my residence of four years In Grass Valley there has never ap
peared an editorial comment in the Morning Union on the labor con
ditions In any part of the country thnt could be taken as anything
but friendly toward the laboring people. I take that to be the sen
timent of the paper and consider such a paper the workingman's
friend.
I believe In "giving the devil his due." 60 to speak, regardless
of race, color or political or religious beliefs, so I say that whatever
harm, if any at all. may have been done by the Union and Herald
in printing the advertisement which caused the boycott to be placed
on that paper it has been offset manifold by the' good the paper has
done the laboring people in this community in the pasj. And I very
much doubt if organized labor has suffered any through the printing
of such advertisement, or 'that it has sustained any benefit by a
boycott being placed on the paper printing it.
I refer to the San Francisco Call, and I respectfully call the at
tention of every member of the Miners* Union and all Bympathlzers
with the labor cause to an editorial in the issue 'of Sunday. Septem
ber 1, of said paper, and I ask them how they^can swallow that
editorial and then go on their way with' a clear conscience. If that
article is not a "defy" "and a slander of organized, labor then my
conception of the principles which organized labor stands for must
be very much In error.
Now If consistency is to be one' of the cardinal virtues of labor
organizations then why not straightway place a boycott on the San
Francisco Call?
If the Miners' Union of Grass Valley Is looking- fpr a newspaper
to boycott it might find one â without using any strenuous efforts to
discover it. eitherâ on which a boycott would Justly fall, -without
causing any local strife. .. â¢

Santa Hosa Coroner's Jury Concludes
That Aged John Huber "Was
Murdered. â¢. .
SANTA ROSA. Sept. 9.â The , body of
John Huber, a German, 63 years old, was
found in an old bunk back of Kobler*s
saloon at Mount Olivet at 6 o'clock this
morning. ! The' verdict of .'the Coroner's
jury this afternoon was that death came
at the hands of unknown persons.
Huber was a hop-picker... He had been
drinking heavily yesterday and at night
went to sleep in the rear room of the
saloon with two -white men and- two
negroes. One of the white men, Miller by
name, is missing, but the other, Antone
Bossman, Is In the custody of .the Sheriff.'
The. fact that Huber and these two men
had been together all of yesterday and
that Huber's money was missing this
znorning directed suspicion toward, his
companions. . --. â¢ I
Coroner Pierce said that the. evidence, in
his opinion, did not warrant the verdict
rendered, as there were no visible marks
of violence. Â¦ The' dead man had I suffered
from fever and ague of late and some be
lieve that this was the cause of his death.

Dr. Mann -said that- some nourishment
had been administered to-day in the form
of an enema and he had taken water in
the stomach. It was found that cold
water did not agree with him and instead
hot as the President can bear it is being
given him. The President's bowels are
moving- freely and this is considered an
excellent . symptom.
"You may assure your clientele that all
goes well. President McKInley's condition
could have hardly, been more satisfactory.
Furthermore you may impress and em

"Besides," he said, "the cases are utter
ly different. : Garfield's wound was an ex
tremely unfortunate one In every way. ' It
was difficult to handle; it was impossible
to get at the bullet, while the wound of
President McKlnley is In many respects
a lucky one. No comparison is possible."
Turning to the correspondent Dr. Mc-
Burney said: .
Dr. Mc3urney was asked to compare the
GarfieVd case and the treatmentrwlth that
of President McKinley. He smiled as he
replied' to do' so would be to give the
whole history of the progress of surgery
during the -last twenty years.
"That is true, perhaps," said Dr. Mc-
Burney, somewhat deprecatingly, .'.'but It
is entirely, unusual. If thePresident con
tinues to Improve for. a.*. week," Â¦. he -con
tinued, "we may safely- say he is a con
valescent. It will probably-be three weeks
before it will be safe to move him. We
must wait until the outer wound is healed
and strong. ' The inner wounds, through
the stomach proper, will be strong before
the exterior wound is. How long it will
be before he will- be able to sit up will
depend upon the rapidity of his improve
ment and I may say to you further that
his Improvement, If ifcontinue. promises
to be rapid." -.. .'
"But I have known a case," put in Dr.
Mann, who was with the noted surgeon,
"to go well for ten days and then change
for the worse."
"No bad symptoms have appeared," said
he. "No one can say now that the Presi
dent Is out of danger and for a week still
the possibility of complications may exist.
At the end of that time, : if all goes well,
we may be able, to say that he is con

NOT OUT OF DANGER,

Martin's friends here profess to be alto
peiht-r ignorant of the cause that led to
the postponement. "There 6eems to be
plenty of time," is all they will say
Miss Jennie Blair, who was getting
ready to go East to be present at. the
wedding-, suddenly decided to abandon her
Eastern tri;\ and everybody else who was
lalkir.g of the Newport wedding suddenly
ceased making preparations.
The news of the postponement of the
wedding of Peter Martin and Miss Llllie
Oe'.richs was not altogether unexpected
in local social circles. The customary
two weeks previous to the date set for
the happy event had come and gone and
es no wedding invitations were received
matters began to take on a -very "post
poned ' air. Then it was known that Mrs.
Kleanor Martin, the mother of the groom,
was making absolutely no preparations
for an Eastern visit, and also that Walter
Martin and liis young bride were not busy
buying wedding presents.
No leason has been made public for thÂ©
postponement of the wedding. The young
lady's family refuse to discuss the sub
ject, and the young couple decline to
make any explanation. They are con
stantly in each other's society and to all
appearances are very devoted to one
another and very much in love.
The postponement of thÂ« wedding,
which, according to rumor, was to have
been celebrated on the 17th of* this
month, meets with the approval of the
interested parties. In fact, Mr. -Martin,
ardent lover that he is, has declared
thera was no immediate hurry for the
weddirg. end. taking advantage of the
postponed day. he has made his plans for
the autumn and winter months. These
plans are both of a pleasurable and busi
ness nature and will completely fill the
months that are to intervene before the
auspicious spring day.
NEW YORK, Sept. 9.â The marriage of
Miss Llllie Oelrichs and Peter D. Martin
has been postponed. The wedding bells
Â¦will not ring out for the happy young
couple until next spring. This Informa
tion was given out to-day by the family
of the charming fiancee, who at the same
time took occasion to deny the reported
breaking off of the engagement.
According to the Berlin correspondent
of the Daily Express United States Con
sul General Mason has expressed the opin
ion that an International conference will
meet ere long to discuss the subject.
- Nothing further has transpired as to the
tour of Emperor Nicholas, but there Is
confirmation of the report thatthe French
authorities are taking extraordinary pre
cautions for his safety;
The Daily News alone utters an editorial
warning against the danger to free gov
ernment and free opinion involved in such
repressive measures, which "would easily
result in confounding the innocent with
the guilty."
Two proposals are. now advocated by the
British and foreign papers. The first is
to 'hold another international conference
with the view of the organization of an
international police force, whose sole duty
would be to keep watch upon such crim
inals. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ ; Â¦ :
The second is to treat anarchist propa
ganda as crime.
"The auestlon of 'how to deal with an
archism Is discussed on every side. It is
felt that if the President happily, recovers
he. will not have suffered in vain if the
outrage 'results in stronger , measures to
suppress anarchism. All the- morning pa
pers have leading articles on the subject
and almost all of these are identical in
tone. Satisfaction's expressed that the
panic measures, such as vigilance com
mittees, wholesale anarchist attacks and
the like, contemplated under the first
shock of the â¢ outrage, have given way to
calmer suggestions.'. .
At the same time it is . recognized that
all danger has not passed and the bul
letins and medical opinions cabled fully
to every paper find' eager readers.
."It takes a man of strong constitution
to make his way to the head of the Amer
ican nation," saya the Dally News, "and
the belief that this strong constitution
will pull him through is 'universal." . ,
LONDON, Sept. 9.â The attack upon
President McKlnley and its consequences
still form' the principal occupation of
the British newspapers. The President's
ultimate recovery la now taken for
granted.
Cardoza, who is a Danish subject and
a native of St. Thomas, immediately took

COLON.' Sept. 9.â On the publication of
the report in Panama yesterday that a
Venezuelan squadron, consisting of four
ships,- was bombar/ling Rio â¢ Hacha, on
the Caribbean. Sea, a lawless, irresponsible
mob "proceeded to the residence of Senor
Cardoza, the Venezuelan ' Consul at Pan
ama, shouting, "Down with the goyern
mfent -of Castro." ' ' ' .
In view of the disability of the Presi
dent it is likely that the Cabinet will con
sider all important questions and deter
mine a policy to pursue, and it- is expect
ed that the next step to be taken by tha
United States in Colombian affairs will
be considered at- the first Cabinet-meet
ing. Colombia has expressed her willing
ness to have the United States use its
good offices, but Venezuela has declined,
and It will now bo necessary to make rep
resentations to President Castro's Gov
ernment to induce it to agree to permit a
peaceful settlement of Its dispute with the
Bogota authorities.

While the Tin Plate Company has put
up the most aggressive fight of the three,
the Steel Hoop. Company has been most
successful in the Eastern district and in
the West the Sheet Steel Company has
met with the larger success. With the
results known in these preliminary skir
mishes at a few chosen points, all three
companies have now prepared to carry the
fight into every union -plant without fur
ther delay.
It was stated by some of the members
pf the board that the adjournment had
left matters practically as they were be
fore the meeting had been called, and that
the strike must go on as before, leaving
arrangements for a possible settlement
through a direct conference of the repre
sentatives of the United States Steel Cor
poration with President Shaffer.
To-day completed the first thirty days
since the American Sheet Steel Company,
the American Tin Plate Company and the
American Steel Hoop Company began
their attempt to start the union plants
of the country in face of the Amalga
mated Association strike. Aside from the
Clark plant of the Steel Hoop Company
and the Upper and Lower Unloiwmills of
the Carnegie Company, where the at
tempt to render the strike effective. was
never a success, the three companies
have during the month succeeded in plac
ing in operation seventy-six mills in : the
Union plants, single turn. Indications are
that the number will be doubled within
the next ten days if the strike Is not set
tled before that time.
The semi-official report is that the prop
osition secured for the Amalgamated As
sociation through the intervention of the
representative of the National, Civic Fed
eration was unsatisfactory and that the
matter of settling and arranging was left
ror President Shaffer. The board. In its
sessions of three days, has been clamor
ing lor a settlement, but satisfactory
terms and means were not at -hand, and
the sessions resolved themselves into an

without date and without accepting any
of the peace propositions that hava come
Indirectly from the United States Steel

Wonderful Predictions.
It has been proposed to erect at Dundee,
Scotland, a granite monument over the
grave j of James Bowman Lindsay. He
was born in 1799 and taught electricity,
magnetism and other subjects in Dundee,
where he died some forty "years ago.' -In
1834 Lindsay foresaw â¢ that- ''houses ' and
towns will in a short time be lighted by
electricity instead of gas, and-machinery
will be worked by- it instead of steam."
This prediction was the result of his ob
servations of- the effects produced by. the
electric current, and not merely, by dream
ing. In 1854 . he transmitted telegraphic
signals through the water electrically, and
when the British Association visited Aber
deen In 1859 he demonstrated, the success
of his method by sending: signals across
the harbor. He also read a paper entitled
"Telegraphing Without Wires."â Chicago

' CHICAGO, Sept. 9.â The opening in wheat
was steady and trading was light with no spe
cial features. The market was Influenced most
by. the stronger tone to the stock market, due
to the more favorable reports from Buffalo
which induced two prominent local longs to add
to their lines. Smaller increase in visible than
expected, with premiums- existing for cash
grain, were also bull factors. December open
ed unchanged to V4@%c higher at 70%c to
70?i@70%c, advanced to 71@71!fcc. closing strong
and He higher at 71c.
Rain, which retards the ripening of corn, and
thus Increases the chances of damage by frost,
was the chief strengthening influence to-day,
although rumors of a bullish Government re
port also tended to keep prices up. December
closed %c higher at 57%c.
Oats were higher in sympathy with other
grains. December closed %@V*c higher at 33
@3JVfec.
Provisions were again dull but prices were
higher. Light offerings was the main cause
for the stronger feeling. â¢ Lard continued to
lead other products owing to a strong cash
demand. January pork closed with a gain of
17V4c Lard 5c higher and ribs 10c higher.

New. York Metal Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 9. â The number of shares
of stocks sold on the "stock exchange during
the five hours of to-day's session was no great
.er - than was sold during , the .two - hours of
Saturday's session. > This fact In itself , would
be indicative of a marked subsidence of the
nervousness and feverishness which 'pervaded
the stock market on Saturday, j but the table
of recoveries in prices which resulted from the
day's trading makes a really remarkable show
ing of the . recuperative power of the market.
The confident opinion of the President's physi
cians and friends that jj he is on - the way to
safe recovery from his wounds was of course
the primary cause of the buoyant rebound in
prices. This"wa3 shown ,not only in New
York, but in all the great securities markets
of the world.' . The secondary cause was; the
comprehensive and effective measures concerted
for the protection and support of Â¦ the market
by the Clearing-house banks and great finan
ciers of. the .metropolis. The effect, of these
measures was seen in the success with which
the call money ; rate was repressed to a 6 per
cent level. Just what the measures taken were
were not disclosed, but the large sums of
money in the hands of . tbe principal money
brokers on the floor of the Stock Exchange to
place In call loans at 6 per cent suggested that
money was being supplied by a powerful syn
dicate for the purpose. The Clearing-house
committee was conveniently at hand all day to
take any action that might be demanded by
an emergency, but there was no formal ses
sion of the committee and no steps were taken
by them until after tbe close of the stock
market, when a dispatch was sent to Secre
tary Gage advising him of the committee's
view that some action by the Treasury
Department was incumbent for the relief of
the money situation. The special circumstances
which make the operations of the Treasury
Department embarrassing to the money mar
ket have been too often stated to need special
description here. The enlarged surplus in the
Government revenues by reason of the great
decrease in the expenditures without . corre
sponding decrease in ! the income is taking
daily from the open market and from the cir
culation large sums of money, just at the
time When the movement of the crops. and the
expanding fall requirements are making the
year's largest demands for money. Some ex
pectation of action by the Secretary of the
Treasury^ for the relief of the money market
played Us part in the day's strength of the
market before the action of the committee was
known. The tension of the demand for money
here was shown also by the decline in ex
change on other points. [ Both . Sterling and
Continental exchange fell sharply, causing re
newed talk of engagements of gold for im
port, but none were announced. Chicago ' ex
chante on New York also rose to within 10
cents of par, but $250,000 was deposited at the
sub-treasury for Chicago and $25,000 for New
Orleans. In view of these considerations the
collapse In the money rate late In the day is
less convincing than it would otherwise be.
Its occurrence after the demand for the day
bad been largely satisfied might have been due
to manipulation. The market closed strong at
near the top, net. gains for the principal ac
tive stocks running from 2 to 4. points and for
St. Paul 6<4- Thus a large part of Saturday's
losses were retrieved.- ? , Â¦ . Â¦ â¢
Railroad bonds showed recoveries also, but
in much smaller degree than In stocks. Total
sales, par value, $2,065,000. United States
bonds were unchanged on the last call.

In his book on "The New South Africa"
Mr. Bleloch, a resident of Johannesburg,
expresses the opinion, after- a careful
study of the statistical position, that the
Transvaal's revenue, which in 1899 Â¦was
S18.500.000. will by 1305 be $37,500,000. suf
ficient to provide $13,750,000 for interest
and sinking fund on a loan* of 5275,000,000,
which will rover the Transvaal's share
of the cost of the war and the cost of the
military police, leaving a- surplus of
52,500.000 for public works. Mr. Bleloch
estimates the amount of gold in the
Transvaal rriin^s at nearly $15,000,000,000,
over threÂ« and a half billions of which
will be net profit. The Xew York World
asserts that Sir David Barbour, the finan
cial expert sent from I/ondon to Pretoria
for the purpose of sizing up the prospec
tive revenue, reports the ' Transvaa.1 able
to pay interest on a loan of but $175,000,
000. The amount which the Government
has decided to make the Transvaal re
sponsible for,. 6ays tho World, has been
increased, on Lord Milner's advice to
5250,000,000.â Baltimore Sun.
"What the Transvaal Can Pay.
A latiy was recently reading to her
young son the story of a little fellow
whose father was taken ill and dJed. af
ter which he set himself diligently to
work to assist in supporting himself and
his mother. When she had finished the
story she said:
"Now. Tommy, if pa were to die.
wouldn't you work to keep mamma?"
"Why. no." said the little chap, not rel
ishing the idea of work. "What for?
Aint we got a good house to live in"
"O, yes. my dear," said the mother,
"but we can't eat the house, you know."
"Well, ain't we got plenty of things in
the pantry?" continued the young hope
ful.
"Certainly, dear." replied the mother,
"but they would not last long, and what

"Well, ma," said the young incorrigible,

Water Front Notes.
The battleship Iowa arrived at Panama
last Saturday and anchored in the road
stead. She left here August 20 and made a
splendid run down the coast. She stopped
at Acapulco for coal and then proceeded
direct to the isthmus. It took her several
days to coal, and as the distance to Pan
ama is 3472 miles she must have averaged
about ten knots during the run from San
Francisco.
Iowa Arrives at Panama.
Henry Peterson, the well-known oars
man and launch owner, was kept busy
shaking hands with his many friends on
the front yesterday. He was away more
than eight months and during his ab
sence visited all the places of note in
Europe and then made a tour of the
United States. While in England he met
all the old-time oarsmen and was the
guest of "Gus" Brewer and later of "Tom
my" Green. The latter is the trainer of
the Oxford University eight, while Brewer
has trained some of the greatest oars
men In the world. Both of them were
very anxious to get Peterson to make a
match with an English crack named Max
well. "Pete" had a great time ,on the
Harlem and put In some time training the
Metropolitan Boat Club crew. Under his
tutelage thÂ» men won four races, and
then Peterson decided it was time to come
home. The blisters he acquired while
coaching" the crews on the Harlem left
scars on his hands that will take some
time to disappear.

SAN BERNARDINO. Sept. 9.â Three
hundred Santa Fe employes in this city
quit work to-day because the company
refused to pay them extra for working
on a holiday. The men will report J for
duty to-morrow morning, but there is
borne doubt as to whether the company
will allow them to come back. Superin
tendent W. B. Beamer said to-day that
the men who quit work need not return.
"Whether this is to be taken as dismissal
or not is a question. The officials of the
road refuse to discuss the affair.
When the employes reported for work
this morning: they found a bulletin posted
on Master Mechanic Lape's office an
nouncing that the blacksmiths, boiler
makers and mechanics would be expected
to work during tbe day. while the car
penters and painters could have a . holi
day. The machinists, blacksmiths and
boiicrm alters went to work, but before
doing so notified General Superintendent
of Machinery G. W. Smith that they ex
pected to receive extra pay for working
on a holiday and that if the company
Â¦would not agree to pay them extra they
would not work. Smith, Superintendent
Beamer and Master Mechanic La.pe held
a. conference and at 3 o'clock had reached
no agreement. The men then held a
meeting and gave the ultimatum that the
officials should reach an agreement with
in a half hour or they would quit work.
The agreement was not reached and they
walked out.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The sloop Leone was out during the
morning with' a' pleasure party aboard.
The man at the wheel tried to go around
the British bark Brussels and got too
close. The result was that the sloop's
mast caught under the vessel's stern and
the stick snapped oft close to the deck.
No one was hurt and a gasoline launch
towed the disabled craft to one of the
wharves.
The schooner Falcon and the brig Ge
neva were, in collision yesterday after
noon. The' Geneva- arrived last Friday
from Ugasik with 4000 cases of - salmon
and anchored off Union-street wharf. , The
Falcon came in Sunday and anchored
near the brig. Yesterday afternoon therte
was a good breeze blowing and a strong
ebb tide running. It was not long before
the Geneva began to drag and in a few
minutes she was down on the Falcon.
The tugs Sea Queen and Sea 'Prince were
sent out, but" It' took- them more than a
half hour to separate the vessels. Both
schooner and' brig' were considerably
chafed and had their standing rigging
damaged, but were not seriously injured.

COLLISIONS ON THE BAY.
The Curacao will take away a large car
go for Mexican ports. She. is scheduled
to sail next Thursday and will get away
at noon sharp. The Oceanic Steamship
Company's Ventura and the Pacific Mall
Company's China are also scheduled ! to
sail Thursday, the former at 10 a. m. and
the China at 1 p.' m. The Ventura will
have a green crew of firemen, but never
theless Chief Engineer Haynes says she
will easily make her contract time be
tween here and Sydney, N. S. \V.
The bark R. P. Rithet made a splendid
showing. She is anchored in the stream,
the center of a fleet awaiting a chance
to discharge. Captain McPhall did not
wait to see what the others were going
to do. but by 8 a: m. had his ship dressed
and kept the flags flying until sundown.
The Rithet arrived here from Honolulu
on the 2d Inst. and will probably go to
Oakland to discharge. -
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
fleet at the Broadway wharves flew all
Its bunting. The City of Puebla, State of
California, . Curacao, Bonita and Pomona
made a splendid showing in honor of the
day. But. little. w.ork. was done on either
wharf. The Curacao finished coaling, but
the Puebla will not begin discharging un
til to-day. As soon as hercargo Is out
she will take in 12.000 cases of salmon
from the bark Fresno.
V DMISSION day was very quietly
i\ observed on the water front.
/ \\ There- were few people." around
X VV the ;..- wharves, but the ferry
steamers were crowded all day.
There was less decorating than for many
a year. Only one sailing: vessel made any
thing like a showing and the vessels of
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company did
the honors for the other lines. British
vessels, that on other occasions were bet
ter decorated than American ones, yes
terday contented themselves with flying
the union jack, while many an American
ship, and San Francisco owned at that,
did not even fly the stars and stripes.

"The Taming of the Shrew," Shakes
peare's delightful comedy, was presented
for the first time at the Alcazar Theater
last night to a crowded house, and the
management is to be congratulated upon
the success achieved by Miss Florence
Roberts, supported by White Whittlesey
and the stock companyl The. version used
Is the one adapted by the late Augustin
Daly, in which Ada Rehan as Katherine
scored such a brilliant success. Miss
Roberts' interpretation of the part is
clever and not lacking In brilliancy. In
the shrewish scenes she was forceful and
effective without exaggeration, and when
completely tamed she was simply bewitch
ing. The scene in the fourth act, when
the taming process is nearlng Its close
was delicious. White Whittlesey is an
Ideal Petruchlo, and gives to the part that
virility and dash which make it thorough
ly convincing and appreciable. His deliv
ery last night was somewhat marred by a
slight hoarseness. Barton Hill as Bap
tista, father of Katherine: Lucius Hen
derson as Luccntlo, Carlyle Moore as
Hortensio and Paul Gerson . as Tranio
were excellent. Agnes Â¦ Ranken was a
charming Blanca, and all the other parts
were well sustained. The costumes were
elegant and the scenery splendid.

Signor Dado has wakened up. His
Mepkisto of last night was an all-round
satisfying performance and largely in
the nature of a surprise. One has known
that the Tivoli De Reszke could look and
sing the part most excellently, but his
Mephlsto in the Boito opera gave not the
slightest Indication that he could act
the role to satisfaction. His work of last
night, therefore, replete with humor,
subtlety and spirit, was as welcome as it
was unexpected, and is one of the bes-t
things of the season s<o far. One point
Signor Dado yet misses, a dear and fa
miliar expectancy with audiences, that of
taking his hearers fully into his conJl
dence in the fooling of the susceptible
Martha in the garden scene â just a glance
to share laughs with them. Thej"Calf of
Gold" was admirably sung, and through
out Signor Dado is at his best. Agnoa

he was heartily applauded for his work.

usual, however. Salassa. in blonde love

"My cousin's story is not true," said
Sinz. "It was at her. request that I went
to the house this morning, but there was
no love-making nor any attempt on my
part to caress or to woo my cousin. I did
have a bottle in my pocket, but it did not
contain poison nor did I threaten to com
mit suicide. The vial was filled with tur
pentine, which I use for cleaning my bi
cycle.
"Mrs. Lemmle asked me to go for a
walk with her, but I had not the slightest
idea what she wanted to do with me."
The police decided that there was noth
ing to be done in the case.
Sinz is a veteran of the Spanish war,
having served on the Oregon during the
trouble with Spain. He was recently
discharged from the navy and is now re
siding at 1372 Ninth avenue. Mrs. Lemmle
was divorced from her husband several
years ago. . \
"My cousin called this morning and in
sisted that I should hear of his love for
me," declared the woman. "He said he
would take poison If I did not say I loved
him and he had a bottle of poison in his
pocket with whicn. to accomplish the
deed.
"I was so frightened that I did not
know -what to do. Then I suggested -we
take a walk, so I could get him into the
hands of the officers. I wanted them to
take charge of him because I feared he
would either harm me or himself."
Sheriff Rodgers directed Mrs. Lemmle to
the police station, where she repeated her
narrative. Sinz, however, put in a vigor
ous denial of his cousin's statements, in
sisting that she was absolutely wronf in
every detail; that he had not thought of
such a thing as lovemaking.
Mrs. Lemmle, by a subterfuge, induced
her relative to accompany her to the
Sheriff's office, where she related the story
of persecution, which formed the basis of
her complaint.

Because, as she claimed, her cousin,
Charles W. Sinz, persisted in making love
to her and then threatening.to take poison

residing at 1827 Adeline street, appealed

and Pastimes of the Gael," in the Gaelic
language, was read by the composer,
Conor Murphy, after which the literary
competition began. The judges of the
contest were Rev. Father Yorke, Jere

subject for competition was "The Utility
of the Revival of the Irish Language."
There were three competitors â James
O'Leary, Michael J. O'Mahoney and M.
J. Connolly â all of whom evinced a thor
ough knowledge of the Gaelic language In
the treatment of the subject. After the
reading. of the essays the judges retired
for a brief period and Rev.. Father Yorke
announced the result. Father Yorke said
that the committee had* taken into con
sideration the style, composition, gram
mar, argument and delivery of the con
testants and It was decided to award
three trophies, in the following order:
First, O'Mahoney; second, Connolly;
third, O'Leary.

ASKS POLICEMEN
TO BLOCK CUPID
The entire work, according to Engineer
Krusi, will occupy eighteen months. This
includes facing the canal embankments
with stone to protect them from the
action of the tides.
The dredger's work will not end with
the pumping of the water from the canal.
It will be shifted to San Leandro Bay as
soon as possible, where it will work at
the pastern end of the canal. The slickens
will be emptied into a dam that has been
constructed around some 600 or 800 acres
of marsh land in the neighborhood.
When the canal is perfectly free of
water the steam paddy will begin digging
its teeth into the embankments. It will
cut away the earth and make levels for
the support of Itself and the rallwav that,
will carry away all its product. It will
dump the earth as it picks it up into tne
little cars that will be run alongside It.
The paddy's task is to dig a canal 400 feet
wide and about half a mile long. In its
course it will encounter two bridges that
have already been built. The paddy em-'
ployed in this work comes from Chicago,
where it worked on the great drainage
canal. ."Â¦
It was understood that Lthe dredger
would be in the canal at least two weeks,
but the big machine performed its work
in just eight days. As soon as it finished
work last night preparations were at once
made to remove it from the canal. The
bridge was opened by means of the
dredger's steam winch, as it, could not be
opened otherwise on account of its rusty
condition, and at high tme it steamed its
way out of the artificial waterway. Traf
fic over the bridge was closed until noon
to-day, the street car system, being com
pelled to. change its time card and bear
all Oakland bound people via the Web
ster-street bridge. - I
The dredger will now be stationed just
outside -the canal, where it will be em
ployed to pump estuary slickens until the
mouth of the ditch is completely closed.
After this work is done the Olympia will
pump the water out of the canal. Engi
neer Krusi of the contracting company
says that the machine will remove all the
water within forty-eight hours. At pres
ent the dredger works with a twenty-inch
pipe when it takes up mud and water, but
when it pumps water only a thirty-inch
pipe is used. Once the water is removed
there will be little trouble in keeping the
canal practically dry.. A small steam
pump, will then be used to take' out all
the seepage and surface water that will
run into it. Â¦Â¦...-â¢.. â¢
ALAMEDjV, Sept. 9.â The big "dredger
Olympia finished its task of removing the
mud from the bottom of the canal last
night. It has cleaned out all the refuse
that had collected in the ditch since work
on the improvement was abandoned ten
years ago, leaving it ready for the steam
paddy that will begin digging into the

AUVEBTTSEMENTS.
Tvorked its way to
the front, and is now known in every city, town and hamlet in the coun'try. Its
staunchest friends are those who have known it longest and have witnessed its
wonderful curative powers in their own families or among their friends and
acquaintances. Grateful patients in all parts of the country tell of their restoration
to health and happiness, and the testimony of these is the highest evidence of the
medicine's Â¦worth. S. S. S. is more popnlar today than ever in its historyâ uoÂ» |
Â¦ other remedy stands so high, has ever given such perfect satisfaction or is so
reliable in the cure of Cancer, Rheumatism, Catarrh, Contagious Blood Poison,
Scrofula, Eczema, Psoriasis, Salt Rheum,' Acne, or any disease that originates in
.the blood. Being strictly a vegetable preparation, you â¢will find it agrees with you
s.*nrach better than a drug store concoction or any of the "widely advertised potash
and mercury remedies, which affect the bones, muscles and stomach, causing
_, - m - Rheumatism or Dyspepsia. If you
Don't Experiment have never tried S. S. S., you will be
.<..:-,'. . surprised at the immediate good effects,-
7"Sl/f@ $m &m $0 for no sooner does it get into the circulation than the
appetite increases; you grow stronger, and gradually
but surely it drives out the poisons and restores the blood to a healthy condition.
If there is a sore or ulcer on the body, it begins to heal around the edges, the dis- .
charge finally ceases and the place gets well ; muscular and bone pains vanish, and
. the skin is relieved of all itching, irritating eruptions. Nervous, run down and
anaemiq people â¢will find S. S. S. just the medicine they need, for blood, poverty
and illy nourished nerves are responsible for their condition. For old people" and
children S. S. S. has no equal; being free from all minerals, it does not nauseate
or have any injurious effect whatever, and keeps the blood in good condition^ thus
fortifying against disease. Experience teaches what is good and what is not good ;
this applies particularly to medicine, and S. S. S., a>remedy that has retained the
confidence of the people for nearly 50 years, must have merit â IT CUKES, is the v
secret of its success. When you call for S. S. S. -^^^- iinna -.^ffi^L.'
don't be persuaded to accept something else â
there is no substitute for S. S. S. It is the only | *7â¢*m f C_^^ B f*^^3
guaranteed purely vegetable blood purifier, and \^^^ ' -\^^^/ \^^^^- \
the safest and best for all blood and skin
troubles. Do not let them force an inferior W^^^^M i^^w^Jr ft*"* Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ i^ J g
mineral remedy on you because there is a larger
profit in it. If you have any blood or skin dis- '*â**
ease, don't hesitate to write us about it; our physicians will carefully consider
TOUT case and advise you without charge. Book on Blood and Skin Diseases freÂ«b

As a specimen of what Englishmen who
become candidates for Parliamentary hon
ors have occasionally- to put-up with the
following little incident is related:,'Visit
ing a. north; country; colliery, during .the
men's dinner hour, a . certain candidate
was advised by. his agent' to ask '/Old
Ben," a supporter, who happened to work
in the pit, to say . a few .words to his
mates. After some little persuasion the
old man acceded to the request, and this
is what he said: -"Weei, mates, I ain't a
goin'' ter tell ye as we're , getten a - real
straight, fair, h6nest candidate." vYou
knows as well as, I -does as thereain't no
sich, thing as a honest politician breathin'.
Howsumever, I've heard both candidates,
an' I've picked oot wot I think is the be3t
of a sorry pair! : Ye' d better, vote for him;
chaps! This,*', indicating the by no means
comfortable candidate, , "this is 'im!" That
was all.â Chicago Chronicle. <â¢- . Â¦.Â¦â¢,-:Â¦Â¦.Â¦
The Legislature of Louisiana' in 1900
passed an act forbidding the leasing, of
convicts .to private parties and providing
that they should', remain constantly under
the control of the State, to be employed in
manufacturing, agriculture arid in such
public works as the construction of roads
and levees.' The manufacturing is confined
to the making of clothing and such other
articles as are needed Â¦ for. the convicts,
while the 'greater^ number of the able
bodied prisoners^ are employed in agricul
ture and the building of public roads and
levees. The State has purchased SOOO
acres of. land in one body on the Missis
sippi River, in West Fellciana Parish, to
be operated as a cotton plantation, and
3000 acres in St. Mary Parish, to be culti
vated in sugar cane. Crops are now being
cultivated on these plantations and every
thing, is working, smoothly. ' The. control
of the prisoners is entrusted to a State
commission, and every- provision has been,
made for the health- and "comfort of tho
convicts.â Dallas News. ?'

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
Mrs. Pingltore took the child after -as
suring . the woman that . she would take
good care of it. After waiting for several
hours and as- the woman did, not; return,
Mrs. Pingitore consulted the policeman
on the beat. He advised her to keep the
little girl until he made a thorough search
for the mother. Failing to find any trace
of the woman, the policeman at 10 o'clock
last night advised Mrs. Pingitore to take
the abandoned child to police headquar
ters, which she did. After listening to her
story Lieutenant Martin ordered the tot
turned over to the prison matron.
According to one of Mrs. Pingitore's
neighbors the name of the mother is
Gertie Dussene. She says she recognized
her while she was speaking to Mrs. Pingi
tore. - An Investigation by the police last
night failed to find any trace of Mrs. Dus
sene. - ' Â¦ ' Â»
Unless the mother of the girl calls for
her to-day it is the Intention of the police
to have her sent- to some public institu

and ' gives evidence of ; having been
neglected. ____'
'â¢Tll.be back in a' few Â¦minutes," she
said. "See that. nothing happens to the
little one until I return." - .

ers were present and delivered addresses.
Bishop McCabe, who delivered the clos
ing address and gave the benediction,
spoke in glowing terms of the work so far
accomplished and urged its continuance
on more extended lines.
Hymns were sung in Japanese by stu
dents and children, addresses were de
livered both in Japanese and English.
The children's singing took the fancy of
the audience and they were requested to
repeat all their numbers. The Rev. T L.
Pearson expressed a hearty welcome from
the people of Hawaii in their request tor
a visit from their BJshop, which the Rev.
Mr. McCabe promised to pay as soon as
his duties would permit. .-

JAPANESE ENTERTAIN
A VISITING BISHOP
Mrs. I. Vishoot committed suicide yes
terday at her home, 6 Collingwood' street,
by asphyxiating herself with illuminating
gas. She had been sick and afflicted with
nervous depression for 'the last two years,
and had made threats that she would do
away with herself.
At 7:05 o'clock yesterday morning her
husband . heard her moving about in the
kitchen.'-- He- hastened in and found her
cleaning some substance out of the sink.
He picked up a few grains of it and found
that it was rough-on-rats, that had been
taken out, of a. bottle on the top shelf of
the cupboard. She denied that she had
had any intention of taking .the poison,
and shertly afterward became cheerful.
Believing that there was no further dan
ger that she would attempt to injure her
self, Mr. Vishoot left the house at, 10:30
for his place' of business, a ladies' tailor
ing store at 1427 Folk street. He returned
at 2:05 o'clock in the afternoon, and found
his wife lying unconscious on the bed,
with one e"nd of a piece of gas tubing in
her mouth and the other end affixed to
the gasburner. Â¦ â¢
Dr. Armistead was summoned from the
Central Emergency Hospital, but the
woman could not be rallied. She was
taken to the hospital in a dying condi
tion and expired a few. minutes after ar
riving there.

',-*:- HERSELF WITH GAS
It is not absolutely certain that a Re
publican nomination is equivalent to elec
tion, but \t is quite certain that a Demo
cratic nomination is defeat registered in
advance. The Democratic organization is
blighted with Phelanism and all the
weakness that the name of Phelan Im
plies. No doubt Gavin McNab and Jasper
McDonald may find some venerable and
respected gentleman of the Monticello
Club who will take the nomination for the
pleasure of seeing- his name at the head
of the ticket, but that will be about all.
There is some talk of offering the honor
of Democratic leadership to the home
ward bound soldier. General James
Francis Smith, but statesmen of the party
do not approve of the tender, as they are
holding General Smith in reserve as the
Democratic nominee for Governor next
year. The politicians who talk of nomi
nating him for Mayor are putting up a
scheme to sidetrack him.
When Colonel Kirkpatnck speaks of
the people with whom he has been asso
ciated lor many years he means the
representatives of the Sharon estate.
Should no objection come from that
quarter the coionel would doubtless ac
cept the leadership if the convention
should decide to place him at the head
of the ticket. ir?
The three leading candidates for chair
man of -the Republican. Convention are
T. D. Riordan, Kdmund .Tauszky and
John H. -Hiliman. In regard to the
.Mayoralty mere is homing uennite. Jonn
C. KirkpatncK, Raroor Commissioner and
manager of tne .Paiace Hotel, is regarded
as a candidate who may develop winning
strengm. At this time He cannot say
positively ttiat a nomination would be ac
ceptable. When spoKen to on the sub
ject he remarked: "It is gratirying to be
told that my nomination might tend to
reconcile many of the conflicting interests
ot the party, but as to my entering the
contest notning of a definite character
can be said ai present. 1 must consult
the people with whom I have been con
nected lor the past fifteen years. Their
interests are quite extensive and their
wishes must be nrst considered."
The convention of the Union Labor
party, which organized last week, will
meet again this evening. Next Monday
evening the Republican Municipal Con
vention will meet at B'nal B'rith Hall,
organize and probably adjourn until Mpn
day, September 30. The Democratic Conf
vention will meet Saturday evening, Sep
tember 28, and probably adjourn until
Tuesday, October 1. Registration for the
municipal election will close September
25. Party nominations must be tiled be
tween September 16 and October 5. and
independent, nominations between Sep
tember 16 and October 16. On October 11
the Election Commissioners will appoint
election officers and designate polling
places. The election will take place
.November 5.
"It is to be regretted that the spirit of
harmony, that prevails in other business
communities is lacking in San Francisco.
If the people here would, unite San Fran
cisco could in a very few years be made
one of the greatest "cities In the world.
We have all. the facilities and the'oppor

our own fault if the benefits of these op
portunities go to other coast- cities. - â¢ .
. "I was in New York during the hot- spell
and Ufe was unbearable. ; I am just de
lighted to get back 1 to San Francisco and
breathe our cool ocean breezes. The New
York hotels are filled with people from

actresses are the popular idols. The con

"Henry Goodklnd. one of the bis oil men

at any time to buy oil lands at a ! good

They: will not, however, touch any of the
schemes of oil promoters that are lauded
by so-called 'experts.' .'
"California fruits and wines are all the
rage in the East. Where a few years ago
the leading- restaurants in New York did
not list our wines, now they are on every
wine list and consumed by the New York
ers. The leading fruit stores display
California fruits and advertise them as
such. I was amused when In July I paid
50 cents for four Bartlett pears. The peo
ple in the Bast realize that there is a
great future in store Â¦ for California, not
only on account of the trade with our new
possessions in the Orient, but also on ac
count of the discovery of oil here. They
have always hesitated to invest money
here for the reason that we did not have
fuel for -manufacturing purposes. Now
that we have oil - as fuel in abundance
there is. no reason why we should not
manufacture and compete with the East.
"The eyes of the financial centers of the
East are upon California." was the state
ment made yesterday by Julius W. Ra
phael, the well known business man, who
has just returned "home after a * nree
months', business trip to the Atlantic
coast.
;"During my sojourn In the East," Â¦ said
Mr. Raphael, "I came in contact with
some of the big financial men. It sur
prised me to find how well they were
posted on the products and resources of
California. Although business is fairly
booming along in the East, capitalists are
eager to invest money in our State. They
are. very much interested in the oil in
dustry and are ready at all times to pur
chase good property. The many wildcat
oil schemes are played out in the East,
though some of the rural population still
take the gilded bait offered by-unscrupu
lous promoters. - . â¢ â¢â¢

Evening Entertainment.
Throughout the world rang the cry I -
The wise, the strong, the fearless could not
wait;. . '
They came by land, by sea, far and nigh.
From these Pioneers sprang the Golden State.
On they came, firm in brawn and strong in
mind.
Heedful of the fatal errors of the past;
They were the strongest of all'mAuic'icl, i
And built a State that will forever last!
Brother Pioneers, we are particularly blessed
in being spared to see our State grow Into
a ereat and prosperous commonwealth. "When
we came here from Missouri this coast was
a wilderness. Out of that vast territory we
have seen State after State formed and ad
mitted Into the â¢ Union, so that what was once
a howling wilderness Is now occupied by a
prosperous American commonwealth.
It is said that Mr. Seward, while negotiat
ing- the purchase of Alaska, declared that
"The Pacific Ocean would .become the scene
of man's greatest achievements." Fronting on
that great ocean, as this State does, with a
coast line of some SOO miles, with one of the
finest harbors on the face of the Kiobo. and
on a direct line from the principal ports in
the Atlantic to the Orient, surely California
has a brilliant prospect.
. The "Discovery of Gold" was the theme
of Dr. Cleveland's poem which was de
livered with marked elocutionary effect.
The concluding stanzas were as follows:
In a little while the tale was told,
The most royal metal 'twas found to be;
Eureka! Eureka! We've crowned with gold;
Crowned with gold for all eternity.
Scene of Greatest Achievements.
In view of the- disturbed condition of the
country consequent upon the attempt at as
sassination of our. President, it might be
thought that we should postpone or defer al
together this annual celebration. This cannot
be done, for the constitution of our -society
declares that the anniversary of the admission
of our State shall be celebrated on the 9th day
of September. The hopes and prayers of tha
whole nation are that the President may recover
and the latest Intelligence indicates^ that our
prayers will be answered and hopes gratified.
On behalf of the Society of California Pio
neers I bid you a cordial welcome to this
celebration of our fifty-first anniversary of
admission of the State into the Union.
Pioneer Hall was tastefully decorated
for the occasion. Conspicuous over the
entrance to the hall was the bear flag,
flanked by the Stars and Stripes. Stream
ers of red, white and blue, with yellow
drapery intertwined, lent a warmth of
color to the main hall. Seated on the
platform beneath -a great American flag
were the officers of the Â¦â society. Potted
palms added to the color\effect.
A programme of rare 'excellence was
presented. There was but one set ad
dress, that of Justice of the Supreme
Court Walter Van Dyke, president of the
Pioneers. An original poem was read by
Dr. Charles D. Cleveland. President Van
Dyke spoke in part as follows: '
Vigorous, almost as in the days when
they started west, the old-timers entered
into the pleasures of the day and night
with a zest born of a love for the State
they helped to build. Heretofore it has
been the custom of the society to cele
brate the day by an outing, followed by
a banquet. But this plan was changed for
the nonce and the committee of arrange
ments, composed of Aylett R. Cotton, E.
M. Root, R. T. Kruse, S. W. Holladay and
W. B. Farwell, decided upon an indoor
celebration.
Gray-haired argonauts of *49 and silver
tressed matrons who accompanied them
across the plains or on the perilous voy
age around the Horn, together with hun
dreds of the younger generation to 'whom
has been intrusted the duty of keeping
alive the memory of those early days,
gathered at the rooms of the Society of
California Pioneers yesterday and cele
brated the flfty-flrst anniversary, of the
admission of California into the American
Union.
