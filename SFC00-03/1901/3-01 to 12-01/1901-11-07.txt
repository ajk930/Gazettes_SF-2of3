VOLUME XCâ NO. 160.
DEFEAT OF REPUBLICAN TICKET GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS REBUKE TO HERRIN,
BURNS, KELLY AND CORRUPT CORPORATION RULE IN MUNICIPAL POLITICS
CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS WHO WERE CHOSEN BY THE VOTERS OF SAN FRANCISCO AT THE ELECTION ON TUESDAY.
Removal of the Revenue
Collector Regarded
as Certain.
THE result of Tuesday's election is
accepted cheerfully by Republicans.
Many of the leaders who did not take
an active part in the campaign de
clare that the defeat of Wells will be
accepted throughout the State as di
rect and scathing rebuke to Herrin,
Burns, Burke, Lynch, Rainey. Gunst,
Go:dberg and the smaller fry of the bosses
who sought to attach the Republican par
ty to Hcrrin's bunch of corporations.
I Y'hen the election returns are carefully
Â» studied it will be found that 10,000 or 11,00)
Republican voters supported Schmitz. Of
The San Francisco Call.
this number fully 5000 voted against
Wells and for Schmitz in order to rebuk?
the bosses. It will be noted also tha.
Wells last Tuesday did not receive as
many votes, including Democrats and Re
publicans, as were thrown for the Repub
lican ticket at the primary election last
August. The conclusion is irresistible that
Herrin, Burns, Kelly, CrimminÃ, Rainey,
Lynch and Burke engaged the services
of 5000 or 6000 Democrats to create the
Republican nominating convention. The
fact that the Democratic ticket at th^
primary election received less than 4000
votes was then accepted as a sure indica
tlon that Democrats were actively med
dling in the affairs of the other party.
Last Tuesday Tobin received three times
as many votes as his party ticket re
ceived at the late primary election, while
Wells fell below the Republican primary
strength. Herein is the proof conclusive
that the 8500 votes cast by the Republican
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1901.
Election Returns Show That Asa R. Wells Did Not Receive as Many Votes
as Were Cast for the Republican Ticket at the Primaries,
Showing That Democrats Then Voted With the Push.
Primary League comprised very nearly
all of the tru* Republican vote of th-i
primary election.
Analysis of the Vote.
Analysis of last Tuesday's figures shows
that 8000 or 9000 Democrats voted for To
bin. Politicians figure that 11,000 Demo
crats voted for Schmitz and 3000 for Wells.
This gave a Democratic vote of 23.000.
Wells probably received 14,000 Republi
can votes, Schmitz got very nearly 11,000
and Tobin 4000. This accounts for 29,000
Republican votes. The total vote of the
city was 53,814. â¢
San Francisco was formerly Democratic
on a close party vote, but since 1896 the
Republicans have had the larger' number
of party voter 3. The Republican machine
bosses made a sorry blunder when they
counted on Schmitz taking three-fourths
of his strength from the Democratic par
ty. Very nearly as many Republicans as
Democrats went over to the musician.
Herrin. Burns, Johnny Lynch and Jere
Burke comprise the sorriest, the soret:
and sickest bunch of defeated machine
bosses that has ever exhibited to the pub
lic of California. Martin Kelly and Phil
Crimmins are not as sore as their con
federates. They saw the storm coming
and sought cover. The story goes tha:
Kelly evened up on Herrin. He couldn't
keep the push in' line for Wells, but ho
kept the corporation money appropriated
for the purpose of lining up the purchas
able. Kelly was the bcid boss who went
I to the front in the primary election and
I brought ever the Democratic push to vote
j the Republican ticket. It is common gos.
! sip that Herrin. at the suggestion of
Lynch and Burke, threw down Kelly, and
I the burly boss of the Twenty -eighth Dis
trlct took occasion last Tuesday to re
taliate.
Republican Bosses Badly Beaten.
In the Thirty-sixth District Frank
French was beaten out of sight. Schmitz
carried the district over Wells by 700 ma
jority. The night before the election the
bosses boasted of their ability to carry
the Thirty-sixth.
The trouncing that the allied Republi
can bosses received in the Forty-fourth
was the hardest ever seen in this city.
Abe Ruef led the Schmitz forces in the
Forty-fourth and carried the district for
his candidate by a majority of 350 over
Wells. The push, led on by Rainey, Her
rin, Johnny Lynch and Jere Burke, Max
well and Graney, sought to S"ave the For
ty-fourth for the corporation ticket. In
ternal revenue deputies imported from thf
interior joined in the fray, as word was
uttered that Lynch would lose his job as
Collector if \\\lls were defeated. Despite

The same fate was reserved for bossism

MAYOR-ELECT AND HIS DEFEATED OPPONENTS TALK ABOUT ELECTION AND EACH OTHER
MAYOR-ELECT EUGENE E. SCHMITZ
GIVES AN OUTLINE OF HIS POLICY
MAYOR-ELECT EUGENE E. SOHMITZ, like Napoleon, Is a man of destiny, who believes In a lucky star. Through
out the campaign a soft, still voice whispered to him that he would be successful, and fortified with that knowl
edge he calmly awaited the issue, which resulted in his choice by the people for the distinguished honor of di
recting the affairs of the municipality during the coming two years.
It is tut just to say in Mr. Schmitz' s behalf that he bears his i.ew-'ound distinction with becoming modesty
and ( n a manner that augurs well for his administration of public functions. Raised in a single day from the
humble station of orchestra leader to the proud and responsible position of executive of the metropolis of tht Pa
cific Coast, the chief representative of 350,000 people, rich and poor, high and low, he now occupies a pedestal which many
more able and distinguished men than he have sought 'n vain to attain. Yot withal Schmitz is not proud. He is es
sentially a rr.r.n of even temperament, cool when confronted by an emergency and calculating when the exercise of sound
Judgment is imperative. In the exhilaration that invariably attends the victor after a hard battle has been fought and
won. Mr. Schmitz has remained placidly calm. The hundreds of-messages of congratulations received from friends and
etrangers alike, the protestations of ioyal friendship by people whom he met for the first time during the campaign,
served to strengthen rather than weaken the latent forces of his character which his victory have aroused. All this, as
well ts his statements to a Call reporter last night, indicate that Mr. Schmitz will give the pe.iple of San Francisco an
administration that will compare favorably with those cf his predecessors in office.
OUTXIHES HIS POLICY AS MAYOR.
"The people of SanpFrancisco are desirous of knowing something of your proposed policy, Mr. Schmitz," said
The Call man to the Mayor-elect at his residence, 2849 Fillmore street, last night. "Are you willing to outline it for
their benefit?"
"My policy," answered Mr. Schmitz, "will be one of conservatism, prudence and as the newspapers express it,
enterprise. I intend to be conservative in all things, and in the consideration of public measures I will be as prudent
as if I were acting for myself. In the matter of public improvements. In which I am a firm believer. I will be en
terprising. I want to see this city grow to the proportions to which "sts geographical location and its rapidly increas
ing foreign trade must inevitably advance it.
"I shall favor every measure that will have for Its object the enhancement of our commercial inter
<Â¦Â»<Â«, and I shall xupport such legislation as will in my judgement advance the social conditions of onr
people. I favor the acquisition of pnblic utilities, and lower gas and water rates. I shall make it my
liuNiness to inqnire into the operations of the various commissions, with a view to reducine expenditures,
and thereby securing; a material rednctlon of the tax rate. I believe the present administration
han been extravagant, and if it is in my power, as I believe it to be. I shall without delay urge and
insist upon the practice of rigid economy in the disbursement of the public money."
"What is your opinion of the Board of Public Works? Is it your Intention to remove any of the commissioners?"
'"My opinion of the Board of Public Works is that it is a wasteful body and in need of thorough reorganization.
That too much is disbursed by the board in the payment of useless employes and not enough for the prosecution of
public improvements has been evident for two years past. While I have not given the matter of reorganization of the
board much thought as yet my present opinion is that there will be some changes in the personnel of that body short
ly after I assume the discharge of my official functions. I think I may safely promise that there will be a material
curtailment of the salary list of the board before I am in office six months."
â¢What do you think of the School Board?"
"I think there has been altogether too mnch bickering: and quarreling? among; the members of
the board to suit the public taste. While the directors have been opposing the School Superintendent
in all matters on political grounds the affairs of the public schools were allowed to saffwr. I think the
efficiency of the department has been impaired by the operations of the board. I shall deem it to be
my sworn duty to bring almnt harmony unions: the directors and the Superintendent in some manner.
If the gentlemen will not listen to reason, we will see what a few removals will acconipliHh. I regard
the school system as one of the most Important adjuncts of the municipal government, and I shall seek
to remedy some of the abuses in the department to which my attention has been called, and -which need
correction. I do not think the schools have been properly managed, and that is saying something."
CASEY WILL NOT BE CHIEF OF POLICE.
"There la a report, Mr. Schmitz, that you intend to secure the appointment of Michael Casey as Chief of Police.
What have you to say in answer to the rumor?"
"Simply that Michael Casey will net be Chief of Police. In justice to Mr. Casey you should say that he does
not aspire to the distinction of being Chief of Police. When I heard the report I asked Mr. Casey how it came to be
circulated, and he informed me that if I were elected he would in no event accept such a billet at my hands, even
were I to offer It to him. 1 will say new that I will never favor any civilian for the office of Chief of Police. The
proper discharge of the duties of that office requires a man of experienceâ a man taken from the ranks of the police.
When it becomes necessary to select a Chief I shall urge the appointment of a police officer of discretion and ex
perience. That is the unalterable stand I have taken in this matter."
"What policy shall you adopt in tne matter of appointment of Commissioners to fill vacancies after the first of
the coming year? Is it your intention to appoint union labor men to such offices exclusively?"
"I have no such Intention. In making my appointments under the provisions of the charter I
shall be guided solely by what I deem to be for the best interests of the city. It would be absurd to
appoint a man to a position for -which he is in no sense qualified. I shall consider the claims of all citi
r.ens to recognition at my hands, be they merchant, inillionnire or union labor men. I shall make my
selections for offices of pnblic (rant in accordance with the same principles I wonld apply in selecting
an employe in my own business. Mo favoritism in the matter shall be exercised. I shall be fair to all,
and there will be no special privileges given to one to the exclusion of another. In the matter of ap
pointments I may say that I stand unpledged, and when I make them I will see to it (hat the best in
terests of the city will be subserved thereby."
"What did you mean when you said in ycur campaign speeches that after your election the spectacle of policemen
riding on trucks would never be witnessed?"
"Simply that under my administration Ido not believe a strike can occur. I believe that I understand what the la
boring class want, and being one of them I am in a position to deal with them intelligently. My election will restore con
fidence between the employers and their employes. My affiliation with labor organizations will enable me to arbitrate
matters should a strike occur, and it was because of my belief that I could mediate efficiently and successfully in the
event of an industrial disturbance that I made use of the statement about policemen on trucks. Had Mayor Phelan been
in closer touch with the working people the necessity of putting policemen on trucks would never have presented itself.
I am a believer in arbitration and if a strike occurs during my administration, I believe I am safe in saying that mat
ters will be promptly adjusted/without resort to the measures which characterized the late strike and prolonged it to an
undue length."
In closing Mr. Schmitz said that the public might rest assured he would not during his administration inaugurate
radical measures calculated to disturb the public serenity. He would seek to manage affairs prudently, and no step would
be taken by him until its effect was as nearly as possible foreseen. In this way, he thought, his election as Mayor would
not prove to be the public calamity some persons deemed it to be. Mr. Schmitz expressed gratification at the receipt of
a basket of violets from Joseph S. Tobin, who extended his sincere congratulations to Mr. Schmitz upon his victory Mr
and Mrs. Schmitz will leave for a two weeks' stay in the country to-day, their destination being kept a secret.
TOBIN ACCEPTS HIS DEFEAT WITH GAMENESS,
AND SAYS THAT HE WILL SUPPORT SCHMITZ
JOSEPH S. TOBIN. as becomes the
man that made the cleanest fight

a game loser. He does not make
pretense of any particular delight
at the result of the three-cornered race
for the chief executives chair, but there
Is no sign of crape about his chambers
in the Hibernia Bank building.
He went into the fight because it seemed
to him his duty. He accepted the nom
ination for Mayor not to gratify the am
bition cf Joseph S. Tobln, Supervisor, out
to fulfill the obligation owed the commu
nity by Joseph S. Tobin, citizen.
He entered the contest for the sake of
San Francisco and not for the purpose of
any self aggrandizement. He thought he
taw in his selection as a candidate an op
portunity to do something for the better
ment of the little world to which he owes
his present prosperity.
The election returns told him that San
Francisco agreed with him that the petty
pilfering of professional politicians, the
domination of the bosses and the rapa
cious greed of corrupt corporations would
no longer be tolerated. But they also told
him that the people had decided to try-
Eugene E. Sehrritz instead of Joseph S.
Tobin to administer the new order of af
fairs.
It was for the people he had made the
fight and to the verdict of the people he
bows gracefully. He made no enemies
curing his canvass.
Hired Traducers.
He was attacked in several instances,
but the attacks were bo evidently the
work of hired traducers that in looking
back over the campaign he finds too
much pleasure in the genuine friendships
Â¦with which its labors were lightened to
remember the boughten yelps with which
c canine kennel punctuated the campaign.
Tobin turned his attention to his own
affairs as soon as the result of the elec
tion was assured and yesterday morning
bright and early he was at his desk in
his law office.

ations anyway, " he said yesterday.
"Schmitz has got a great opportunity and
for San Francisco's sake I hope and think
he will make the most of it. Anything
but Wells and what stood behind him."
In response to a request for an after
the-battle statement, Supervisor Tobin
expressed himself as follows:
"Let TJs Forget Bitterness."
"A defeated candidate is not as a rule

HEADQUARTERS
LOOK CHANGED
THE DAY AFTER
Party and Candidate Cen
ters in Hands of
Wreckers.
Republican Quarters in Grand
Hotel Continue as
. Dormitories.
The day after election is usually a per
iod of contrasts. On the street the cry
of "He can't lose" is changed for "I told
you so," "Just what I expected all along"
and -Well, if he does the right thing, I
gues he'il be safe enough for two years."
In the headquarters of candidates and
political parties the indiscriminate bustle
of campaign was changed to the business
like activity of moving day.
The campaign headquarters were far
from being deserted yesterday, but the
crowds that thronged them were differ
ent. During the campaign all the head
auarters were crowded. There were men
waiting to give the respective committees
the "low down" regarding dubious dis
tricts and tips as* to how the wavering
populace could be brought into line with
committee noints of view. There were
men waiting with stories as to the magic
influence of a double eagle placed in
proper hands for dissection; there were
men waiting with schemes for placing
before the public candidates and views of
the committees at so much per "place."
There was whispering, handshaking, mys
terious telephoning and there were meet
ings behind closed doors.
It was all different after election. There
were stern-faced janitors at all the head
quarters yesterday examining walls for
undue damage done by the tacks and
nails that had held the cards telling of
candidate virtue and party promise.
There were owners of borrowed furniture
scanning the foot-scrapes on the varnish
of their chairs and desks. There were
telephone employes unscrewing the elec
tric messenser boxes that the night be
fore had been the confessionals of the
election returns. There were agents
around for the rent or to see to the lock
ing up of the temporary capitals of
Democracy, Republicanism and Trades
unionism.
At the headquarters of the Labor Un
ion party there was quite a number of
callers. "Schmitz" was the burden of
conversation, and "Schmitz" as a text
seemed to be prolific of orations as to
how it had all been done.
The Democratic headquarters on Mar
ket street Dresented a scene of moving
day, with an occasional character on the
stEge to tell he knew all along just what
would, be the result of the election.
The Republican headquarters, at the
Grand Hotel, will continue to be used for
sleeping quarters.
RIORDAN GIVES HIS VIEWS
Thomas D. Riordan. chairman of the
late Republican municipal convention, ex
plains the defeat of the Republican can-
I didate for Mayor In the following words:
I ascribe Wells' defeat in the first place to
the fact that the labor unions have not re
ceived from either party the recogniticfn to
i which they were entitled, and as a result
f thereof, when the strike took place, they con
sidered that everybody was allied against
them. I consider that in nominations to public
j office the laboring element is entitled to as
j much consideration as the commercial or pro
f fesslonal class.
I Another cause of Wells' defeat was the small
, ness of the vote, which was due to the fact
I that many at the workers In the. party have
! not received the recognition to which they are
| entitled and were not taken Into consideration
| when nominations were made or the patronage
apportioned. This applies equally as well to
the Democratic party, as is evidenced by the
smallness of Mr. Tobin's vote.
I believe in the proposition that has been
adopted by Tammany in New York, where the
I district leaders and the district workers are
' taken Into conference when nominations are to
I be made or patronage distributed.
This election shows both to the Republican
and Democratic parties that one-man power
cannot and will not prevail. Mr. Wells Is a
man of unimpeachable inteftrity, a man with a
perfect record in business and political circles
and would not have been defeated except for
the dissensions prevailing in the Republican
I party and the dlssatipfactlon of the laboring
I element on account of lack of recognition.

BARBER CALISH SHOULD BE ASKED
TO HURRY UP HIS RESIGNATION
THE foregoing Is a fac-slmile of letters sent out before the election by J. J. Callsn, president or tnÂ» state commis
sion to Regulate Barbers. The barbers of California should take the earliest opportunity to regulate Calish. The use
of the official letter-head of the board in requesting support for the candidate of the bosses was improper, if not
indecent. The Governor cannot very well remove Calish, but the barbers ought to demand the resignation of the
offending Commissioner.
WELLS TALKS OF THE ELECTION AND GIVES
REASONS FOR HIS DEFEAT AT THE POLLS
ASA R. WELLS, the defeated can
didate on the ticker arranged by
Herrin and Kelly, and by their
permission called Republican, was
seen yesterday by a representa
tive of The Call.
"My defeat as the Republican candidate
for the Mayoralty," he said, "came as a
distinct surprise to me. I was under the
impression that I was fighting the Demo
cratic party and at no time did I con
sider the Labor candidate a dangerous
factor. I see now that I made a mistake
in entertaining that opinion.
"I consider that the immediate cause
of my defeat was the superb organization
of the Union Labor party. Almost every
single class of laborers has a union and
these were given to understand by the
labor leaders that in their support of
Schmitz lay their protectionâ their salva

"Now as I calmly and dispassionately
review the situation I firmly believe that

Result of Discontent.
"The determination of the laboring men
to stand by their leader was the direct
result of discontent at the treatment they
had received at the hands of the municipal
authorities. Schmitz rode in on a wave
of bitterness engendered during the strike
and neither I nor any other man could
have prevented the result.
"Another potent cause that surely con
tributed to my defeat was the opposition
of The Call and Chronicle. I believe that
the continued â¢hammering' of the two
journals cost me at least 2500 Republican
votes which, had I redved them, would
have turned the tide in my favor.
"These voters deserted me because the
two newspapers named prevailed on them
to believe that I was dominated by the
bosses. Although they could bring abso
lutely nothing against my personal char
acter or official life they made some voters
imagine that I was under the control of
bosses who were not good men.
"I have no regrets at my failure to bÂ«
elected to the highest office in the gifi
of the municipality."
VAUDEVILLE HOUSE BURNS.
Audience in Atlanta Theater Leaves
Before a Panic Occurs.
ATLANTA. Ga., Nov. 6.â The Lyceum
Theater, a vaudeville house, 'was de
stroyed this afternoon. A performance
was being given when the flre broke out,
but the audience was dismissed in time
to prevent a panic.
The flre was preceded by an accident,
which caused some uneasiness in the the
ater. An immense electric sign extending
across Edgewood avenue in front of the
house fell Just as the performance began,
throwing two electricians to the ground
and injuring one of them, Roy Danner.
The wires became crossed and burned out
a feedbox at the entrance to the theater.
The smoke found its way into the build
ing and caused much excitement in the
audience. Some of those inside attempted
to leave, but were immediately stopped
and urged to remain seated and the per
formance proceeded. One hour later
flames appeared on the roof of the theater
and the management dismissed the au
dience, their exit being expedited by the
ushers. In about an hour the theater was
in ruins. Fred Jones, a fireman, was
badly burned. The financial loss is $5000.
AGED HERMIT REIGNS
ON HUNTING GROUNDS
â¢'King of the Hills" Keeps Pasadena
Sportsmen Away From a Quail
District.
PASADENA, Nov. 8.â "Old Man Rob

of the hunting grounds west of this city
and will not allow hunters to shoot there.
It is a place where quail nock and which
hunters have frequented for years, but
they go there no more because an ancient
hermit with a club drives them away.
Roberts is a peculiar character. He lives
In a small observatory cabin built by Mil
lionaire C. B. Scovllle on grounds once
planned for a park. The old man owns
very little In the world, and his few uten
sils he packs into a gunny sack when he
goes out foraging at the back doors of
restaurants for food. He never leaves his
belongings at home, or separates himself
from them for a minute while away from
home. Hunters are wondering how they
are to oust the "king of the hills," whose
little cabin stands at the summit of a.
precipice, down which he might hurl
bowlders upon venturesome visitors.

ADMIRAL SCHLEY IN TEARS WHEN THE PRAISE
OF HIS CONDUCT AT SANTIAGO IS SPOKEN
â¢ . J.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 6.-The
climax of the Schley court of
inquiry came this afternoon,
when Mr. Raynor, the chief
counsel for Admiral Schley,
concluded a brilliant argument of over
three hours with a peroration so eloquent
and impassioned that all within sound of
his voice were profoundly touched.
This remarkable trial, he said, sought to
condemn the man who had brought to a
successful termination as great a naval
triumph as was ever won. In vivid colors
he painted the picture of the Brooklyn,
with Commodore Schley on the bridge,
fighting the entire Spanish fleet until the
Oregon appeared out of the smoke. The
thunders of the Brooklyn, music for the
ears of his countrymen, he said, aroused
; Admiral Schley's .envious foes. He pic
; tured the victorious sailor suffering as
! few have suffered for three long years
while the tires of persecution leaped
'Â¦ around him and now awaiting the hour of
his vindication in the verdict of the court.
"And when it comes," he concluded, "he
: can, from the high and exalted position
i that he occupies, 100k down upon nis tra
' ducers sand mahgners and witn pride ex-
I claim; *I care not for the venomous gos
' sip /6t clubs, drawing-rooms and cliques,
j aXd the poisoned shafts of envy and
I malice. I await unGer the guidance 01
I Divine Providence the verdict of pos-
I terity.' "
Impressive Scene in Court.
The scene in the court room as he fin
: ished with these words was thrilling. The
' attendance had been large an day and
i at the morning session a lady had tainted
i from excitement. As Mr. Maynor Degan
| his euiogy of Admiral Scnley those in tnÂ«
I audience, many .of whom were ladies,
Â¦ leaned forward in their seats. The spell
I of his oratory was over them and wnen
he described the* admiral's gallant deeds
; and the long persecution to which he had
1 been subjected many of them broke down
and wept.
The members of the court displayed cvi-
I dence of emotion and Admiral fachiey him
i self was plainly moved. He sat leaning
back with his hands behind his head. â¢ His
chin twitched and as his counsel said he
could afford to await the verdict of pos
terity tears rolled down his cheeks. He
i moved uneasily to conceal his emotion
' and, under thÂ« pretense of adjusting his
. glasses, brushed the tears aside. For fully
I thirty seconds after Mr. Raynor closed
; there was not a sound. Then the ten
i sion broke in a loud burst of applause.
Admiral Dewey, after about a half mm'
' ute. arose to remind the spectators that
j such a demonstration was out of plae^.
A moment afterward the court adjourned,
the judge advocate pleading that he
could not well go on to-day.
Then a remarKable thing happened. As
! soon as the gavel fell the entire audience
I surged forward to shake the hands of
, Admiral Schley and Mr. Raynor. But the
! on-coming spectators fell back a moment
i as they saw Admiral Dewey and his two
assistants move around the table, as if
by a common Impulse, and congratulate
: Admiral Schley and his counsel. Even
j Captain Lemly, the judge advocate,
! joined in the congratulations. Then the
! public had its inning and for fifteen min
i utes after the court adjourned Admiral
J Schley and Mr. Raynor were kept busy
shaking hands. '
Argument for Schley.
Raynor's argument consumed the whole
day of the court, except for a half hour
at the opening which Captain Parker, his
associate counsel, occupied in concluding,
j Raynor took up the speciiications one by
' one. reserving those relating to the- retro-
I grade movement until the last. So far
I as he was able to do so he used the tes
; timony of the department's witnesses to
I prove his contentions. With regard to the
' retrograde movement, which he discussed
I with greater seriousness than the other
specifications, he adduced in justification
, not only all of Admiral Schley's reasons
for believing the Spanish fleet was not in
Santiago, but argued that every officer
taxed with the responsibility of command
; necessarily must be clothed with discre
tion in carrying out instructions. He dis
played good temper in adverting to the
testimony of most of the officers, especial
ly the ranking officers who seemed to
: contradict his case, giving them in each
case credit for honesty of purpose. But
; Â¦with a few he dealt unsparingly. Wood,
'. Potts and Bristol he held up to ridicule.
\ Captain Lemly will begin the closing ar
! gument to-morrow afternoon, as the court
I will not hold a session to-morrow morn
! ing. -
CONTROVERSY IN" COURT.
Echley's Representative and the
Judge Advocate Clash.
Â¦WASHINGTON", Nov. 6.â Admiral Dewey an
nounced privately before the openinp of the
Schley court of inquiry to-day that there would
be no morning session of the court to-morrow.
Mrs. Dewey had been indisposed recently and
the admiral will fievote the forenoon to remov
ing her to their city residence from the sub
urbs.
Captain Parker concluded his address and
was followed without loss of time by Isidor
Raynor, Admiral Schley's chief counsel. Par
ker maintained that the blockade of Santiago
was effective. He commended Admiral Schley's
I I iilllliilâ nri of May Cl, saying he had a<te<i
wisely in determining the actual conditions
In this line of policy he snid that Commodore
Schley's conduct was paralleled by th.it of Ad
miral Dowey in Asiatic waters when the lat
ter remained for several days in Mirs Bay.
Regarding the loop made by the Brooklyn Cap
tain Parker declared it was the wisest move
that could have been made. All talk about
the Brooklyn going to the southward he char-
Eed as "moonshine."
"If tbe Spanish gunners could have shot as
the Americans did." concluded Captain Parker.
â¢'Admiral Schley, instead of being on tria! as
he is to-day, would he in a sailor's grave."
Referring to the Hodgson controversy < 'attain
Parker declared he believed Hodgson desired
t tf-11 the truth, but unfortunately he had told
a different story every time he had opened his
mouth.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1901.
Attorney for the Distinguished Naval Off cer
Delivers an Exceedingly Impressive Ad
dress Before the Court of Inquiry
Captain Parker said he did not know how
the alleged controversy over the danger of
colliding with the Texas started except from
the story told by the captain of the lowa.
Captain Parker was sarcastic in his allusion
to Captain Evans' alleged statement regarding
the damage he had done to the Spanish ships.
Captain Parker concluded with a glowing trib
ute to Admiral Schley.
Raynor began his argument at 11:23 a. m.
He paid a compliment to Judge Advocate Lem
ly and his assistant, Mr. Hanna, for the "most
judicial Impartiality with which they have
managed this case." He then made a plea
lor the consideration of questions from what
was at that time Commodore Schley's point
of view. â¢
"Let us," he said, "put ourselves in his
place and see what the circumstances were.
We all know what it would have been wise
to do."
The "Dsar Schley" Letter.
Discussing dispatch No. 7. known as the
"Dear Schley" letter, Raynor contended that
the order conveyed in that message made it
incumbent upon Commodore Schley to remain
at Cienfuegos. He declared that this was the
key to the whole case and that it did not
admit of any other construction than that
Commodore Schley should remain at Cienfuegos.
In support of this contention he read the de
partment's order to Admiral Sampson.
He then took up the McCalla memorandum,
the message delivered by the Eagle to Com
modore Schley and the testimony oi Lieutenant
Hood and declared that Admiral Schley was
the victim of an unfortunate combination of
circumstances that left him in total darkness
as to the location of the Spanish fleet.
Concerning the Question of coaling at sea
Raynor read the testimony of several witnesses
to prove the great difficulties such a task in
volved. He said that all they wanted' to prove
was that Admiral Schley was honest when he
informed the department of his increased anx
iety regarding the coal supply and that he
acted according to the dictates of his own con
science. He was prepared to prove that one
ship could not have followed the Spanish fleet
Mx hours and have had enough coal leit to re
turn to Key West.
Coming to the reconnoissanee of May 31 Ray
nor contended that it had been Commodore
Schley's chief intention to develop the Spanish
land batteries and in this he said he had been
eminently successful. He claimed that the man
who was in command at such a time should
be given great discretion, tor he must neces
sarily know more of the situation than the
gentlemen who make out battle plans at home
on charts with compass and pencil and direct
other people thousands of miles away how to
fight a battle. Raynor referred satirically to
the testimony of Lieutenant Bristol, saying
amons ether things:
"His vision was a divine inspiration. Sex
tants and stadlmeters, compass bearings, Gov
ernment measurements and hydrographic plats
were all dim and obscure in comparison with
the miraculous power of his unaided vision,
which lit up and illuminated the entire har
bors of Cienfuegos and Santiago, with the un
erring precision of the morning sunbeams.
Government experts with mathematical accu
racy had measured the height of Morro Castle
and Zocapa battery, but down they went one
hundred feet when they encountered Bristol's
miraculous eye."
Raynor next came to the consideration of Ad
miral Sampson's Interview with the commander
of the flying squadron, especially referring to
Admiral Schley's testimony relative to the di
rections of Admiral Sampson, with reference
to attacks upon land batteries. He alto re
ferred to Captain Chadwick's testimony ln this
connection.
R*ynor said he thought that Captain Chad
wirk had been forgetful, but that no charga
could be made against him on that score. Ad
miral Schley. however, who had given positive
testimony, would be guilty of perjury if his
statement was not true.
"They must have talked about something,"
he said, "and what would they be more likely
to have discussed than the guns on tlie
south coast of Cuba. whither Commodore
Schley was then hound?"
Reverting to the blockade of Cienfuegos
Raynor said Capta!n McCalla had admitted on
the stand that he himself had disobeyed orders
in not leaving the Eagle off that port when
he left for Key West. He did not, he Bald
mean to criticize Captain McCalla, but if he
was not to be censured for disobedience of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET N
\\, WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â France has
officially communicated - tjo the United
States an explanation of her purposes in
occupying the island of Mitylene, belong
ing to Turkey. This explanation was made
to-day to Secretary Hay by M. de Mar
gerie, Charge d'Affaires of the French
Government, and as stated by that diplo
mat it is so convincing and clear as to ef
fectually remove any misgivings which
may have been entertained by the- Presi
dent and Hay regarding the intentions <**
France.
It is learned authoritatively that M. do
Margerie explained that in occupying tha
island of Mityiene ranee has no inten
tion of permanently homing Turkish ter
ritory. A' aue regard tor Her interests in
the Orient compelled her to take this ac
tion. The justice of her claims has been
repeatedly recognized by the sublime
Porte. home ot them arose out of mci â¢
dents which occurred twenty-live years
ago. They were diplomatically presente-J
io the buitan with the necessary proof.
M. de Margerie himself, who was sta
tioned in Constantinople tor ten years, was
engaged in negotiations tor their settle
ment. The Sultan agreed to pay but failed
to keep his engagements. The matter
reached a stage where French dignity
could no : longer permit evasion. As a sign
of her displeasure and in the nope of caus
ing the execution of the Turkisn pi onuses
the French Embassador in Constantinople
was withdrawn. Two months passed an 1
the Sultan still failed to meet his admit
ted obligations.
Has Important Interests.
France has important interests In Tur
key, religious and otherwise. French mis
sions, French schools, hospitals, etc., are
established there. In order to insure their
protection in the future and to maintain
French prestige it was necessary to com
pel a settlement of the claims. France
had no desire to precipitate conflicts with
other powers. So instead of landing-troop,
on the' mainland of Turkey she deter
mined to occupy an island belonging to
the Porte. France feels, and it is sail
here justly, that she shouid be reimbursed
for the expenses which she has incurred
in dispatching a force to Mitylene, aid
that as compensation for â¢ the trouble to
which she has been put the Sultan should
definitely fix the status of certain French
establishments. within his territory. When
these demands are complied with France
will withdraw from Mitylene.
By reason of his service in Constantino
ple M. de Marijerie was able to fully ex
plain the causes which led to the action
of his Government. One result, and a
very important one, of the French policy
will be, it is believed, to cause Turkey
hereafter to meet her obligations, and it
is pointed out that should an indemnity
be dO'Tianded for Miss Stone the Porte
will show a disposition to meet the de
mand more expedltiously than 'it- would
have done before the French demonstra
tion. In view of M. de Margerle's expla
r.atlon the authorities are confirmed in
their 1 purpose not to send warships to
Turkey. . :

orders why he asked, should Admiral Schley
be?
After luncheon Raynor discussed the ninth
specification which dealt with the loop of the
Brooklyn on July 3 and the possibility of col
liding with the Texas. Raynor said he stool
upon the testimony of Captain Cook, who, all
things taken together, had the best oppor
tunity to give all the information about the
loop. What might have happened had the
Brooklyn turned to port was purely a matter
of conjecture. The turn in the other direction
was completely successful. It was intimated
that the turn to the southward would have
been to get away from the enemy, yet it was
an undlsputable fact that the turn had brought
the Brooklyn closer to the Spanish fleet and
that she received thirty of the forty-three shots
which struck the American ships. Captain
Cook's testimony, he said, Illumined this
maneuver, and he planted himself upon this
test.mony.
Raynor then discussed the testimony of Heil
ner and Hodgson, and in this connection ridi
culed the chart prejrared by the navigators of
the ships In the battle. He then took up
specification No. 10, concerning the Hodgson
controversy. He said he would not undertake
the task of extricating Lieutenant Commander
Hodgson from his predicament. He read por
tions of Hodgson's testimony and again fell
back upon Captain Cook's testimony as deci
sive of the point at issue. Captain Cook had,
said Raynor, stated that the danger of a coi
lision had never entered his head. Referring
to this testimony, he said:
"You cannot impeach him. If I had my
way I must say I think I would have rested
this case when Captain Cook's testimony was
done. I did not do so because the admiral
wanted to take the stand in his own vindi
cation."
No one, he said, had Intended to attack Hodg
son, but the entire controversy was Hodgson's
own fault.
"There has been too much magazine
and too much gossip," he said. "Imag,ne such
a conversation between the commanding offi
cer of a great fleet and a subordinate officer
at such a time. Even if Commodore Schley
had said 'Damn the Texas," " continued Ray
nor. "it would not have been such a' serious*
matter, as It could not have been meant seri
ously. Down in Ann Arundel County. Mary
land, they use such language in salutation,
paying "Damn you. how are you this morn
ing?' ". But the trouble was. he said, th&t
the public did not have the proper conception
uf the occurrence as reported, but had gath
ered the idea that the Brooklyn was running
away frcm the scene of conflict. Admiral
Schley had denied the reported colloquy, he
said, but not until after it had done him great
Injury.
Raynor then took up the first specification â
Admiral Sch'Â°y's conduct during the campaign.
"Now we come to Mr. Woods and Mr.
Potts," ho said. Mr. Potts and Mr. Woods;
Mr. Woods and Mr. Potts." (Laughter in the
court.)
After reading the testimony of several offi
cers as to the splendid bearing of Admiral
Schley, Raynor read the testimony of Potts to
the effect that the admiral appeared nervous,
"that he got up and sat down." Raynor pro
ceeded to ridicule Potts as "that precocious
cnild of the kindergarten, who confessed that
he was always scared when he was in battle,
but who. unfortunately, was never engaged in
any battle sufficient enough even to arouse his
timidity."
I/Â°mly Makes Protest. Â¦
At this point Cartain Lemly protested against
Raynor' s strictures of Lieutenant Commander
Potts.
"Counsel is traducing the reputation of an
officer of ability and high standing," said Cap
tain Lemly.
Raynor replied: "You have no right to tra
duce the reputation ot Admiral Schley."
Captain Lomlyâ I do not think that counsel
should say that this is an attempt to traduce
Admiral Schley. I am not here because I want
ed to be, but because it was my duty. I was
ordered to come and I think it is unjust and
shows how utterly unreliable he is in his state
ments.
Raynorâ l do not think the court will permit
this. Tou must not make a statement of that
sort. I will not permit it.
Admiral Deweyâ Xo.
Raynorâ He is not only very unreliable, but
very offensive.
Captain Lemlyâ Counsel gets up and says
that we are, in our discharge of a most painful
duty, trying to traduce Admiral Schley.

Recovered.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 6.-The police have i;<
custody at the Four Courts a man and a
woman suspected of complicity in the roh
bery of an express car on the Great
Northern Railroad near Wagner, Mont ,
July 30 last, when the safe was blown
open with dynamite and a consignment
of unsigned notes for the National Hank
of Helena, Moni., amounting to between
$50,000 and $100,000 was stolen. Of this
amount $8500 in new notes of the Helen i

Last night the man was taken into cus

just as she was about to leave the citj.
Their arrests followed the passage of sev

Stockton Woman Missing.
STOCKTON, Nov. 6.â Mrs. Peter Jensen
â¢was reported to the police this afternoon
as having been missing since Monday
night from a lodging-house in this city.
It is feared she has killed herself. Her
husband, Peter Jensen, lives in Livermore
and a son lives in Waverly. She was
known in Marysville, where she was for
some time before coming to Stockton, as
Katie Smith.
Porte has sent a note to M. Bapst, coun
selor of the French legation, forwarding
the monthly draft of the customs in pay
ment of the l,orando and Tublni claims
and embodying certain decisions of th.Â»
Turkish Government regarding the quay i
difficulties. M. Bapst has forwarded the
communication to Paris. Â¦
Raynorâ l have borne willing testimony to the
impartiality with which he has tried his case
and the delicate position he occupies. But I
do ask my brother not to getyup and contradict
me and say that I am unrelmble when I read
the testimony that sustains me. I appreciate
the position he is in. He has filled that posi
tion as well and faithfully as it could possibly
be filled by any one. I have not said a word
in criticism of his conduct. It is only when he
refers to my traducing an officer that I have
the same right to refer to his traducing Ad
miral Schley.
Admiral Deweyâ The court of course will read
all the testimony that has been given. We will
be governed by the testimony. We know ex
actly what Lieutenant Commander Potts sail.
He said he was scared, but counsel did enlSge
a Httle on it.
Raynor took up the other specifications and
reviewed the testimony of the various wit
nesses against Admiral Schley. He closed as
follows:
"I now have briefly presented this case as It
appears to me in its general outline. Such a
trial as this has never to my knowledge taken
place in the history of the world. It seemed
to my mind that this case had hardly opened
with the testimony of Captain Higginson when
it commenced to totter, and from day to day
its visionary fabric dissolved from view. When
Captain Cook, their last witness, was put upon
the stand the entire structure collapsed, and it
was when the witnesses from our own ships
and the gallant captain and crew of the Oregon
and Admiral Schley had narrated their unvar
nished tale that the whole tenement, with all
of Its compartments, from Its foundation to its
turret, has disintegrated and lies here like a
mass of blackened ruins.
Three Years for Truth.
"It has taken three years to reveal the
truth. There Is net a s ngle word that has
fallen from the tongue of a single witness,
friend or foe. that casts the shadow of a re
flection upon the honored name of the hero
of Santiago. He has never claimed the glory
of that day. No word to this effect has ever
gone forth from him to the American people.
The valiant Cook, the heroic Clark, the ln
mented Philip, the intrepid and undaunted
Walnwright and all the other captains and
every man at every gun and every soul on
board of every ship are equal participants
with Admiral Pchley In the honor wrought
upon that immortal day. We cannot strike
clown his figure standing upon the bridge of
the Brooklyn. There he stands upon the
bridge of the Brooklyn, his ship almost alone,
and receiving the entire fire of the Spanish
foe until the Oregon, as if upon the wings
of lightning, sped into the thickness of this
mrrtal carnage.
" "God bless the Oregon'. 1 was the cheer that
rans fmm deck to deck, and on they went,
twin brothers in the chase, until the lee gun
was fired from the Cristobal Colon and the
despotic colors of Srain were swept from the
face of her ancient possessions. 'Well done;
congratulate you on the victory.' was tlr
streamer that was bent from the halyard
of the Brooklyn, and from that day to this
no man has ever heard from Admiral Schley
the slightest whimper or Intimation that he
usurred the glory of that imperishable heur.
The thunders of the Brooklyn as she trem
bled nn the waves have been discordant music
Â¦to the ears of envious foes, but they have
pierced with a rinsing melody the ears of his
countrymen and struck a responsive chord at
the fireside of every American home. And
what is more than all which has been re
vealed in this case, as matchless as Is his
courage and as unsullied as is his honor, is
his beautiful character and the generous
spirit that animates his soil and the for
civing heart that beats within his bosom.
Yes. we cannct strike him down. Erect he
rtacda as the McGregor when he stepped on
his native heather and his eye was on the
peak Ben Lomnnd. His country does not
want to strike him down nor cast a blur on
the pure escutcheon of his honored name.
"For three lons years he has suffered, and
now. thank Grd. the hour of his vindicntion
has come. With composure, with resignation,
with supreme and unfaltering fortitude, he
awaits the judgment of this illustrious
tribunal, and when the deliverance comes he
cm. from the high and exalted position that
he occupies, look down unon his traducers and
malieners and with exultant pride exclaim:
'I care not for the venomous gossip of rhibs
and drawing-rooms and cliques and cabals
,-md the poisoned shafts of envy and of
malice. I await, under the guidance of di
vine Providence, the verdict of posterity." "
Raynor closed at 3:3 C o'clock, having spo
ken about three hours. The laree audience
broke into applause when he concluded and
the members of the court, as well as others,
congratulated him upon his speech. Admiral
Schley was visibly affected by the conclud
in* remarks and attending scenes. The court
adjourned until 2 n. m. to-morrow, when Cap
tain Lemly will deliver the cloning argument
.or the Government.

VIGOROUS WAR
Indians in Mexico Ob
tain More Arms and
Ammunition.
Miners Fecome Uneasy and
Many Are Leaving the
Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex.. Nov. 6.-Henry T. Jack
son, who left here three months ago on
a mining expedition to the Yaqui gold
country, returned to-day. He says that
the Yaqui Indians in the State of Sonora,
Mexico, have secured a new supply of
arms ar.d ammunition and that the war
against the Mexican authorities has been
resumed on a more vigorous scale than
ever before.
The Indians have had several engage
ments with the Mexican troops near Torin
and a number of small scouting parties of
government troops have been cut off by
superior forces of Indians and massacred.
Jackson says that although none of the
American mining men in the Yaqtli val
ley have been molested by the Indians,
there is nv-:ch uneasiness, and some of
the prospectors have moved out of the
country, abandoning their claims. It is re
ported that the Yaquis secured their new
supply of arms ana ammunition through
a junta which they have established in
San Francisco.
HTJTIN OFFERS TO SFXL
THE PANAMA CANAL
Submits a Proposition to Admiral
Walker, Head of the Isthmian
Commission.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â President Hu
tin of the Panama Canal Company Anally
has submitted to Admiral Walker, the
head of the Isthmian Canal Commission,
a proposition on behalf of his company
for the acquisition of all its rights by th.Â»
United States Government. Tne Panama
company has been restrained up to this
moment from submitting a direct proposi
tion owing to o clause in the concession
which it holds from the Government of
Colombia which prescribes forfeiture of
the concession as a penalty for the mak
ing of an effcrt by the company to trans
fer its rights to another Government.
The company's agents here have been
obliged to act with extreme caution in
making overtures, but in some way the
Colombian Government has been induced
to wink at this technical violation of the
concession. It 3 terms are not yet dis
closed and it Is probable that they wi'l
not be until the Isthmian Canal Commis
sion publishes its report. It is under
stood, however, that they are considera
bly more favorable to this Government
than the figures made to the Presldert
three years ago.
Police Arrest Alleged Swindler.
BARCELONA, Nov. 6.â At the request
of the German Consul General the police
have taken into custody a man named
Estermeyer, who, the Consul General
claims, is a notorious swindler and has
long been wanted for numerous crimes
in Germany. The prisoner is known here
by the name of Billerbeck. He claims to
be a citizen of the United States. Ester
meyer was manager of the Securities
Guarantee Company.
Bicycle Thief Sentenced.
SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 6.â William
Varry was to-day sentenced to one year
in San Quentin Prison for stealing a bi

thief and the officers are investigating his
past record.

JEFFRIES AND RUHLIN APPROACHING THE TURNING POINT IN THEIR TRAINING
FOR THE BIG CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT NEXT WEEK IN MECHANICS' PAVILION
UNIVERSITY TEAMS
ON THE GRIDIRON
6TANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 6.â
The varsity lined up against the second
eleven to-night for the last practice prior
to the big game on Saturday. Two halves
were played of five minutes each and dur
ing most of the time the big team plowed
at will through the second eleven.
Although the coaches would not allow
the varsitymen to oppose the second
eleven for longer than ten minutes, owing
to fear of possible injury to the players
and a desire not to overwork them so soon
before the contest for th* season, the
eleven went into the game with such dash
and vigor that two touchdowns were
scored, one in each of the short halves. A
larger score would have resulted had not
the varsity lost the ball on the second
eleven's two-yard line after bucking them
the length of the gridiron. Fumbling is a
feature of the A>ig team's play that is
alarming the cardinal rooters, but it is ex
pected the signal practice and light work
of the next two days will overcome this
drawback.
The fact that Tarpey played on the var
sity during the entire practice to-night
would indicate that he is close to the front
in the race for left end; certainly the
freshman's -offensive work justifies his
holding the place.
The coaches have net given out the line
up for the big game, as at least tv-'o posi
tions axe uncertainâ center and left end.
Huayerman was played at the former
position during the entire practice to
night and he and Lee seem evenly
matched; the latter, however, has had two
years' varsity experience, which will
count in his favor. While Tarpey was
played at left end during the practice to
night, that does not necessarily mean that
he has won the position, for Clark, Pres
â¢ ton and Butterfleld are also playing good
ball. Cooper seems to be a fixture at right
end. BarnhiÃel and Thompson will un
doubtedly be the varsity guards, Traeger
McFadden the tackles, Raltt quar
terback, Slaicer fullback and probably
Fisher and Hill the halves.
The annual football rally occurred in the
assembly hall to-night. Students crowded
the ball as soon as the doors were thrown
open and their enthusiasm knew no
bounds. The hall fairly rang with col
lege yells and gongs and good-natured
badinage passed freely betwen the root
ers. Never before has Stanford seen such
an enthusiastic and successful rally The
team coaches and President Jordan were
greeted with a thunder of applause as
they entered and passed down the main
aisle of the hall. The rooters called first
far Dr. Jordan. He said in response:
I belteve in football because It is one of the
beÂ«t ways to teach loyalty, perseverance and
nerve. A football team shows what a coll ere
man ought to be and what a college mln
ought to do The whole tone of the colleges
of the Lnited States has been raised eince foot
ball came Into vogue. I will be glad to be
with you when we win on Saturday
We have a team that does not know when to
quit. Because the second has scored on the
varsity occasionally is not a sign that Berke
ley can do bo; our second is better than their
first. However. U. C. has a good team We
haven't been trying to run up big scores In
the preliminary games, but have been savine
our energy for the big game.
Captain Fisher followed, thanking the
men for the excellent spirit shown on the
field and the graduate coaches for their
untiring efforts. He said: "Chances are
about even, but we hope for victory."
Coach Flckert responded to the cheers
of the crowd with a few brief remarks
BERKELEY, Nov. 6.â To-night the
California team llnÂ«d up for the last
time with the second eleven. The play
wae brisk and determined. The varsity
easily forced the ball down the field for
long gains. A feature of the practice
was Overall's punting. He was given
several tries for practice, and lifted the
pigskin with great precision for an av
trage of forty yards.
The heavy practice waa short and foi
The Champion Seems Tireless,
Wearing Out All His Train
ing Assistants With Ease
He Has Decided Definitely to
Take Up His Quarters at
Oakland on Friday Night
HARBIN SPRINGS, Cal., Nov. 6.â
Jeffries worked harder and fast
er yesterday than he has done
since he began training for his
â¢ coming battle with Ruhlin. The
champion seemed indefatigable and yet
when he concluded his task he felt fresh
and strong. The endurance the big fel
low possesses is marvelous. He can tire
three men and yet come up smiling and
ready for more labor. He did enough
stunts this morning and' afternoon to
make other pugilists who have trained
for contests look like deuces. When Jeff
is in the mood to work he goes at it with
a will. Nothing will daunt him. If his
sparring partners show a -desire to make
things interesting he accommodates them.
Frequently they are perfectly willing to
let Jeff cut out the pace, because they
cannot stand the going as he can.
This seemed to be the case Tuesday.
Brother Jack was willing to spar in a
friendly fashion, but the champion wanted
nothing of this kind of work. He sailed
right in for his brother and never let up
until he had Jack mending bellows at
the end of the third round. During all
this heavy fighting Bob Armstrong looked
on with wide open eyes. Bob likes to
box, but he does not care to go a hot
pace when out of condition. He therefore
viewed the fray with anxious eyes.
Jeffries signaled Bob to take up where
his brother left off, and in a moment the
two big men were slamming each other in
a manner that signified that something
was doing. In a mix-up Bob shot his
right across and caught the champion
flush on the mouth. Jeff's lip was badly
cut by the blow, but unmindful of it ne
bored right in. He retaliated by giving
Armstrong a short arm blow in the ribs
that made Bob gasp for breath. Bob was
too foxy a ring general to show he was
in distress. He stepped back and began
to feint until he recovered his breath
Then he went In again, but Jeff made him
retreat all over the gymnasium. At the
end of the third round Armstrong was
blowing and tired. Jim took pity on his
sparring partners and called it a morn
lowed after an hour's secret signal work.
The varsity secured a touchdown after
a few minutes' play, and later, when the
ball was near the Fcrub line, it was re
turned to center and again kicked off.
Duden and Womble, on account of
bruises, were not in the line-up. Both
will be in shape for the intercollegiate
game.
The varsity will go on the field as fol
lows: Gendotti center, Overall right
guard. Stow left guard, Hansen right
tackle, Albertson left tackle, Hudson
right end, Starr left end, More quarter,
Womble right half. Mini left half, Duden
full. On the defensive Hudson and Wom
ble will change positions and More will
go into the back field. Should More go
cut at quarter Hudson will take Kls
place. Womble will go to end and Whip
pie to half.

his rowing machine. He swung his pon
derous arms back and forth for nearly
ten minutes.
Jeffries then decided to punch the bag.
For ten minutes longer he hammered tho
inflated sphere at a lively clip. His blows
were powerful and rapid. He wound up
his bag-punching by dealing the bag half
arm hooks. The blows sounded like heavy
cannonading, and the few spectators who
watched him expected to see the bag
burst at any moment. As a final touch

medicine ball. He had his brother Jack

first game the Mission team was defeated

After luncheon the big fellow amused
himself playing croquet with the guests

Akron Giant and His Friends
Talk Confidently of the Big
Fellow's Chance of Victory
Give the Facts and Figures
on Which They Base Their
Claims on Championship
RUHLIN is so confident he will
defeat Jeffries that his manager,
Billy Madden, has already made
arrangements for him to appear
in the leading role of a drama
written for him by Playwright Martin J.
Dickson. Should he prove the victor Ruh
lin will commence his theatrical tour dur
ing New \ear~week in Louisiana. While
all this depends solely upon whether or
not Ruhlin wins it is indicative of the
spirit of confidence which pervades the
Ruhlin camp. Billy Madden, and in fact
everybody in the Ruhlin camp, seem to
have an honest conviction that their man
will wrest the championship from the big
boilermaker. Ask any of Ruhlln's inti
mate followers how they figure this out
and they say, "Oh, from his first fight
with the big fellow and the manner in
which he put the 9ailor away after Shar
key made Jeff press his limit to get the
decision."
There are many followers of the ring
who claim Sharkey was "all in" when
he fought Ruhlin about fe. year ago. Jeff
made him a particularly easy mark for
anybody to whip, they say, but a peep
at Sharkey's record discloses the fact that
he displayed more ability in the knock
out line after his fast fight with Jeff
than at any previous time during his
career as a star heavyweight. He pol
ished off Tim McCormick in two rounds,
put Jim Jeffords away in two rounds, sent
Joe Choynski into the land of nod in two
rounds and sent Yank Kennedy after the
loser's end of the purse in one round.
"Now," say Ruhlin's followers, "if Shar
key was all caved in about the ribs and
otherwise foundered after his fight with
Jeffries how is it he showed such good
form in his subsequent battles? Sharkey
was not a man who had a penchant for
knocking his men out and if he was in
jured in any way in his fight with JeffrleÂ«i
he wculd have certainly showed it in his
battles immediately after."
The kernel of the whole argument is
that Sharkey was as good a man the
night he lost to Ruhlin as he was the
night he lost to Jeffries and that Ruhlin
in knocking Sharkey out in fifteen round 3
did what Jeffries or no other living man
up to that time succeeded in doing in
twenty-five or any other number of
rounds.
Ruhlin and his adherents speak confi
dently of victory, and it is not because
they think Jeff is a dub or does not know
how to fight.
Ruhlin worked hard yesterday from
morning until night. After a hearty
breakfast, he took his usual run to the
Sierra Point House and back. Gus was
paced by Tom Herman, the ban
tam weight, and by Denver Ed Martin
Both fighters took turns at pacing Ruhlin
and they brought him back to Blanken'3
in an hour and a half, exceptionally good
time for the distance. Ruhlin's wind is
in remarkably good shape. In a few days
he will cut out the long road work and
confine himself to 100-yard sprints as pipe
openers. Billy Madden received a letter
yesterday from E. W. Dickinson, manager
of the Olympic Club, Grand Rapids Mich
stating the writer and a party' would

BAD COMPLEXION.
The skin is the seat of an almost end-
less variety of diseases. They are kncwu
i by various names, but are all due to the
same cause, acid and other poisons in
the blood that irritate and interfere with
the proper action of the skin.
To have a smooth,; soft skin, free from
all eruptions, the blood must be kept pure
and healthy. The many preparations of
arsenic and potash and the large number
of face powders and lotions generally
nsed in this class of diseases cover up
for a short time, but cannot remove per-
manently the ugly-blotches and the red,
disfiguring pimples.
Eternal vigilance Is the price
of a beautiful complexion
when such remedies are relied on.
Mr. H.T. Shobe. 2704 Lucas Avenue, St. Z.ou!s,
Mo says : "My daughter was afflicted for years
with a disfiguring eruption on her face, which
resisted all treatment. She was taken to two'
celebrated health springs, but received no bene-
fit. Many medicines were, prescribed, but with-
out result, until we decided to try S. S. S.. and by
the time the first bottle was finished the eruption
began to disappear. A dozen bottles cured her
completely and left her skin perfectly smooth.
She is now seventeen years old. and not a sign of
the embarrassing disease has ever returned."
S. S. S. is a positive, unfailing cure for
the worst forms of skin troubles. It 13

Ancestry and Birthplace.
1.1 Hung Chang : was not sprung from the
Manchu or Tartar stock, which has furnished
the rulers and governors for China since the
overthrow of the Ming dynasty in 1C44. but.
like his august mistress, the Dowager Em
press, with whom for some twenty years odd
re shared power and prominence in Chinese
affairs, he was of pure Chinese descent, a fact
which makes his career all the more remark
able.
He was born at Ho-fei in the populous prov
ince of Nran-hui, where it is said the succes
sive generations of his family had resided from
a time even antedating the reim of Kublai
Khan, the grandson of the great Jingis, and
the friend of Marco Polo.
As to the exact date of his birth there Is some
difference among foreign writers. Some place
It In Bl while others fix it on February 16,
1J23, which is meet probably correct. His
father was in moderate circumstances, and
though he had taken his bachelor's degree at
the examination halls lacked the energy and
influence necessary for advancement, and In
time took his place among the unemployed of
the literati class.
Of his mother little Is known, but we may
fcifer from the fact that two of her five sonsâ
*.'. Hung Chang and LI Hang Changâ rose to
viceregal rank that she was a woman of no
ordinary ability, and did her part well by her
children. The most touching thing in Li's

His Youth and Education.
Of Li Huns: Chang's youth not much 1b ac

was the second son of the family; that he was
very studious and at a very early age he was
noted for the rapidity and beauty with which
he -wrote the complex characters of his lan

nese is afways recarded as a ready title to
honor. . . ,

ones out of 15,000 competitors, and in the final
schools he acouitted himself so well that the
highest degree ever given was conferred upon
him and he was admitted to membership of
the Hanlln College, the highest literary body
in the whole empire. It may be remarked here
that the studious habits of his youth were
kept up in after life and there were few pro
fessional scholars in the whole vast empire
who could claim any advantage within the
range of the Chinese curriculum over the busy
old diplomat.
Membership in the Hanlin Cijllege carried
with it a certain salary, beside* entailing the
duty of furthering by every possible means the
advance of learning. As a rule a member of
the Hanlin College received in hi 3 turn an
appointment in the public service, and this
would have been his lot but for the interven
tion of extraordinary circumstances by which
his enersries were diverted into a much wider
and more active sphere than usually falls to
the lot of Chiness civilians.

party machinery for railroad uses was
hatched during the last session of the
Legislature. A measure was put through
the Legislature to fasten bossism on the
people. It was engineered by Herrin and
Burke, Democrats, and John Lynch, Re
publican. It provided for the interven
tion of a State Central Committee into
local affairs. The vicious law was in
voked to compel or induce the Election
Commission of San Francisco to recognize
an apportionment of delegates, and a call
for a local convention emanating from the
Kelly-Crimmins County Committee. The
day that the Republican State Central
Committee came to San Francisco and at
a general meeting in Golden Gate Hall
slapped the Independent anti-boss Repub
licans in the face, the defeat of the party
in the municipal election was rendered
certain. Attention of Republicans and the
Republican press throughout the State is
directed to this phase of the contest. Had
our citizens belonging to the Republican
party been left alone to adjust their dif
ferences, harmony might have been re
stored, but after Judge McKinley, at the
suggestion of Governor Gage, came here
with a prepared programme to exclude
the Republican Primary League, there
was no hope for peaceful adjustment. The
Independent Republicans determined to
fight the boss machine and they fought
and won.
The victory has much more than local
significance. It means the overthrow of
the boss machine in State politics. Sen
ator Perkins will have no further trouble
in determining on which side of the fence
he shall alight. John Lynch, the obtru
sive and offensive collector of internal
revenue whose displacement Senator Bard
recommends, cast his political fortunes
with the bosses and went down to igno
minious defeat. His days as a Federal
office-holder are numbered. Stephen Kelly
of San Bernardino is getting ready to flic
his official bond as collector of internal
revenue for this district.
Before another election takes place the
Market Street Railway will have passed
to the control of Eastern capitalists, and
Jere Burkes occupation as a political
manipulator for the corporation vanished.
Samuel M. Shortridge, who is acknowl
edged to be a better orator than Wells,
emerges from the campaign somewhat
pad but still aspiring. He was the only
Republican speaker of any note that con
sented to speak for the boss interest. The
result of the local election diminishes by
one the number of candidates for the
United States Senate.
Crimmins did not accomplish as much
in his district as Herrin exnected. A
brief review of the situation is thus ex
pressed on the street: "Crimmins did not
. clety, whose Drofessed object was to over
throw the ruline Manchu dynasty and seat a
representative of the Chinese line on the
throne, had kept the southern provinces of the
empire in a disturbed condition, and In 1851,
headed by one Huns Siuts'uan, who styled
himself Tien Wong:, or Heavenly Prince, they
broke out in open rebellion. After overrun
ning the province of Kwang-s!. they started
on n. devastating; march northward, and gath
ering numbers as they went, crossed the prov
ince of Hunan to the Yangtsa River, passed
down that stream and early in 1853 appeared
before the eates of Nankin, which they soon
captured. This city, which had been the capital
of the empire under the Ming dynasty, the
Tien Wong proclaimed as the imperial city of
the Tainirut (Great Peace) dynasty which he
proposed to found, and appointed four of his
most faithful followers, Flng;, Yang, Siao and
Wei, as kings of the south, east, west and
north to assist him, besides others named
later.
Having captured all the cities and devas
tated the country on both sides of the river
to down near Its mouth, an advance on Pe
king was undertaken. In May, 185.1, a column

the police of San Francisco that his wife
had left home with her little boy and that
she was supposed to be mentally unbal

Mrs. Adolphson says that she left home

she is not in the least insane. She says
that she could no longer stand his treat

The pudding for the push was the can
didacy of Fisk for District Attorney.
The political sharps, on the quiet, hint
that they "pulled Flsk's leg In the most
approved fashion." He was told that he
would win out for District Attorney in
the election and be placed in line for
Mayor two years hence.
No one knows how much money he
squandered in the struggle, but the boys
pir.ched a deal of it. His defeat is a sad
blew to the bosses, but his running was
a joy to the ever-hopeful push. It is a
proverb among the "grafters" that every
red-hot campaign produces one sucker.
Fisk was the Examiner's special favorite
on the Republican ticket and in view of the
services rendered by him to the paper in
the investigation of the police by the Leg

that the Examiner did not make a bet

native, province. His patriotic ardor was
aroused to the highest pitch, and, deeming it
the duty of every man who had any Influence
or authority to exert It to the utmost in his
country's behalf, he raised a regiment of mi
litia and took the Held against the rebels. They
were too strong to face, but he hung on their
rear and harassed their flanks as they advanced
northward with such tenacity and vigor as to
cause them great annoyance and stamp himself
as a" leader of no mean ability. When on de
feat of the first column at Tientsin both started
on the retreat to Nankin, pursued by the Gov-'
ernment troops, LI with his militia was on the
alert, and, though unable to fully bar their
way. checked and retarded their progress to
such an extent as to give the Imperial troops
time to overtake and destroy them by the
thousands.
This useful work and great service attracted
the attention of Tsing-Kwofan, the Vlcftroy of
Hukwang (Honan and Hupah provinces), the
generalissimo of the imperial forces, who at
once enlisted Li and his men under his imme
diate command.
Wins Military Fame.
Though trained for civil life, LI waa well
fitted lor that of a soldier. He was of strong
physique and commanding stature, being S
feet and 2 Inches in height, with bright,
piercing eyes, and possessed of natural strategic
ability and great tenacity of purpose. After
Tsing Kwofan LI was unquestionably the ablest
Chinese leader of his time.
He rose rapidly trom rank to rank until In
1859 he was sent as Taotai or intendant of cir
cuit to the province of Foklen. Soon after be
waa put at the head of operations against the
Taiplngs and with the able assistance ot
"Chinese" Gordon, which he bad secured,
finally checked them, and in July, 1564, by the
capture of Nankin, their capital, brought the
rebellion to an end.
In recognition of his sen-Ices ho was made a
Plh or Earl, "guardian of the heir apparent,"
and given a yellow jacket.
Thus launched Into public service, he con
tinued therein until his death.
His services, promotions and degradation* in
all these years were too numerous to allow no
tice of any but the most important. Following
the suppression of the Taiplngs he was made
Viceroy of Hukwang with his seat at Wuchang.
In lÂ»6y he was made a Cabinet Minister and
soon after charged with the suppression of the
rebellion in Yunnan and then of the great Mo
hammedan uprising In Shensi.
China's Principal Spokesman.
While he was yet engaged in Sbensl tha ter
rible tragedy, the massacre of the French sis
ters and priests, waa enacted at Tientsin. The
crisis was a most grave one, and China's best
ma.n was needed to handle the situation. LI
Hung Chang, was summoned post-haste and
made Viceroy of the metropolitan province of
Chihll, in which the trouble lay. Here he
nrsi came in contact with European diplomacy,
and from that time on was the principal if not
the sole mouthpiece of China in dealing with
the outside world, and his acts are part ot
well known history. , To give here the more
important events in their order must suffice.
France, placated for the Tientsin affair in 1573,
Li made an important treaty with Japan. The
following year he settled the Formosan
troubles with that country.
In 1575 the Emperor, Tung-Chi, and the
Empress died, and the two elder Dowager
Empresses came again into power as regents.
Li was soon made Grand Secretary. In 18^6
he was charged with the settlement of the
trouble with England arising out of the Mar
gary murder in Yunnan, which he accomplished
by the famous Chefoo convention. In 1877 the
great famine occurred in Shensi and Kansu,
and on his shoulders fell the burden of reliev
ing the starving millions. The undertaking
was stupendous on account of the Inaccessi
bility of the region, but he organized an ef
ficient system of relief and gave, it is said,
over a million taels from his own purse for
the purchase of food and seed wheat.
In 1878 he settled the long standing dispute
with Russia over the Kuldja district retaining
It to China. In 1882 his abilities were exer
cised to their utmost in handling the out
break in Korea, and In ISS4 he outwitted the
French Commissioner, Fournier. In the settle
ment of the dispute over the Tongking-Chinese
border question. In 1885 a fresh outbreak in
Korea required a new treaty with Japan,
which he made with some advantage to China.
In 1886 he concluded another treaty with
France, and in 1887 negotiated the British out
of Port Hamilton, which they had seized.
Closing Chapters in a Great Life.
In ISSS LI was stricken with paralysis and
desired to retire from public life, but it could
not be allowed. He subsequently recovered
almost entirely.
In ISS4 tne war with Japan broke out. Li
wai relegated to the background for a time,
but soon called to the fore, and In 1595 sent
to Japan to make a treaty of peace. There
he was attacked and wounded by a fanatic,
but bore himself bravely and turned the in
cident to secure better terms for his country.
This treaty and the diplomatic handling of
the events that followed it bear a high tribute
to Li's keenness as a diplomat and farsighted
ness as a statesman. The consequences are
yet developing and a review of the whole must
wait.
In 1896 LI made his memorable tour of the
world, visiting all the principal capitals of
Europe and the cities of the Eastern part of
the United States. His retinue and equipment
were worthy of an Emperor, and he made
a great impression wherever he went.
When the recent great Boxer uprising in
Northern China and the siege of the legations
occurred Li was at Canton, being the Viceroy
of Kwangtung.
He was summoned to Peking, but wisely
delayed going until the foreisn troops were in
possession.
The oourt remained at Singan, whither It
fled, and charged LI with the principal part
In the long drawn out negotiations for In
demnity â which were concluded. How well lie
acquitted himself of that last great work Is
not yet fully seen.
Li was often called the "Bismarck of China"
and the "Gladstone of the East," but it is
a question whether either comparison pays a
full and fair tribute to the manner in which
he accomplished the great tasks imposed upon
him. He for thirty years met the best diplo
mats of the world and can hardly be said to
have been worsted.

FTJT OFF BY CONDUCTOR,
FIRES SHOT AT ANOTHER
John Lefevre Under Arrest on a
Charge of Assault to Com
mit Murder.
John Lefevre, who claims to be the
keeper of a boarding-house at First and
Folsom streets, took a shot at Martin
Guyer, conductor of a car Â»lying over the
Eddy street route to the beach, when the
car was passing Seventh avenue last
night at 11:45 o'clock. He was arrestttt
and charged with an assault to commk
murder. The bullet just grazed Guyor s
face.
Lefevre was out to the beach with a
crowd of sailors. On the return trip he
created a disturbance on the car and was
put off by the conductor. The next car to
come along was in charge of Guyer.
Without warning Lefevre, who was stand-
Ing near the tracks, drew his revolver and
fired a shot at the conductor. The car die',
not stop, and on arriving at the Halght
street entrance to the park the assault
was reported to the police.
Policemen McManus and O'Shea were
sent out on the case. They found Le
fevre, who was making for town on foot.
They placed him under arrest. When
searched at the station a revolver with
one chamber exploded was found on his
person. The first report sent out was to
the effect that masked robbers had at
tempted to holl up the car, but such was
not the fact.
SUIT AGAINST THE EGG
ADDLEKS IS DISMISSED
Charles N. Champion and Fruitvals
Quarry Company Settle Differ
ences Out of Court.
OAKLAND, Nov. 6.â The suit brought
by Charles N. Champion, through At
torney General Tirey L. Ford, against the
Frultvale Quarry Company to enjoin it
from operating a quary in Fruitvale and
injuring the business of the chicken
ranchers in the neighborhood through fre
quent blasting that would .necessarily en
sue, was dismissed to-day, the attorneys
for the litigants having arranged a com
promise.
One of the reasons why the plaintiff did
not want the quarry in his neighborhood
was that the violent concussions were apt
to addle the eggs his chickens laid and in
jure the health of the fowls. The plain
tiffs sought a permanent injunction to re
strain the defendants, but now this is not
necessary and the eggs and chickens are
safe.

THE DEFEAT OF WELLS.
MR. WELLS has gone down to defeat amid the
wreck of the Republican machine. That which
was expected to be a Republican walkover
has turned out to be a veritable retreat from Mos
cow. Not only has the head of the ticket fallen, but
most of the other candidates have fallen with him.
Virtually the machine has been broken to pieces, and
the aspirants for office who relied upon it to carry
them through are scattered like the passengers of a
wrecked automobile.
To intelligent students of our politics this result of
the campaign is not unexpected. From the first it
was predicted by The Call and by other authorities
that had made a study of the political situation and
the temper of the people. Every step taken by the
bosses who controlled the machine tended to destruc
tion. Where they did not act like knaves they acted
like fools. In not one single important proceeding
from the time they began till they nominated a ticket
for Supervisors that the head of the ticket condemned
did they act with sagacity or even decency. If they
had deliberately tried to wreck the machine they
Could not have gone about it more successfully than
they did.
In the first place the bosses called in the State Cen
tral Committee, the Federal brigade and the State ad
ministration to help them dominate local politics.
When, through the aid of the State Central Commit
tee, given in a manner so flagrantly unfair that the
very henchmen laughed at it, the bosses obtained con
trol of the local machinery of the party, they placed
it in the hands of two Democratic railroad bosses,
W. F. Herrin and Jere Burke. Those two men,
neither of whom was ever a Republican, proceeded
to virtually dictate the nominees of the Republican
party. Such domination would in itself have dis
gusted many Republicans, but when it was perceived
that the nominations were in the interest of the cor
porations rather than of the city, the disgust became
general, and the defeat of the ticket was assured.
By the vote on Tuesday the rank and file of the Re
publican party, the independent, self-respecting mem
bers of the organization, called Burns, Lynch, Kelly,
Crimmins and the rest of the gang to an accounting.
Those men. by their affiliations and alliances with cer
tain Democratic bosses such as Sam Rainey, man
aged to carry the Republican primaries by voting the
whole push of both parties for the candidates of the
bosses. Having gained control of the convention
they turned it over to the corporation bosses. It was
the Democratic attorney for the Southern Pacific
Company, for the Spring Valley Water Company and
the Market-street Railway Company who really named
the leading candidate? on the Republican ticket. The
result was the breaking away from the party of the
large independent Republican vote that elected
Schmitz.
The member? of the State Central Committee who
insisted the bosses in carrying out their schemes can
study with profit the result of their trickery. They
sullied themselves by doing a dirty work and they did
it for nothing. They put upon the party the shame of
Herrin's domination, and the result is defeat.
The interference in the fight of the Federal push,
headed by Collector John C. Lynch, is sufficiently
notorious to merit special reference. Lynch converted
his Federal office into a political bureau. He not
rnly himself neglected his official duties to do poli
tics, but he required his subordinates to be equally
indifferent to the work they are employed to per
form. Frequently persons having business at the Col
lector's office would find no one there to wait upon
them. Lynch even went so far as to bring his depu
ties from the interior to take part in the fight for Her
rin's men. Such offenses are too serious to be lightly
passed over. It is the duty of Senators Perkins and
Bard to take notice of them and have Lynch removed.
Xor should there be any delay in doing so. The man
i< utterly unfit for the office. He does not even try
10 fit himself for it. All public interests demand his
removal.
m::r,. SCHMITZ'S programme.
MAYOR-ELECT Schmitz in an interview with a representative of The Call on
Tuesday night gave an outline of the policy he would adopt when he takes of
fice. His statement can be read with satisfaction by all who are concerned in the
welfare of San Francisco and the conservation of law and order. It contains an
assurance that as Mayor-of the city Mr. Schmitz will in no wise support or sanction any
thing which tends to lawlessness and violence or any movement designed to disturb busi
ness or interfere with industry.
After recalling the fact that his father was one of the pioneers of the city, and that
he himself is a native son, having no other interest than the upbuilding of San Francisco,
Mr. Schmitz made three significant statements: First â "All classes and elements will
have just and fair representation in the commissions to be appointed by the Mayor. I will
consult the best interests of the city in making changes, and will fully respect the non-par
tisan spirit of the charter"; second â 'The Union Labor party did not exact a pledge of me.
I have made no pledges and therefore am in a position to exercise my own judgment in
the important duty of appointments to various commissions"; third â "I am a Republican,
and if parties swing back to their natural positions I will be found in the Republican
camp. I regard my election as a just and overwhelming rebuke to bossism."
From these statements the public will perceive that Mayor-elect 'Schmitz does not
regard himself as a representative of a class among the people, he does not deem himself
bound to labor agitators or demagogues, he does not look upon his election as a triumph
of labor against capital. He is a Republican. Like so many other staunch and true Re
publicans he revolted against the domination of the bosses who dictated the Republican
ticket. He perceives in his success a proof that the people are opposed to boss rule. In
heading a ticket in opposition to the boss ticket he did not abandon any of the political
tenets of Republicanism, and now that boss domination is overthrown he will be found
again in the Republican camp.
Those statements, made on the very night of the election and when Mr. Schmit2
was for the first time assured of victory, will go far to relieve the public of any fears that
may have been felt of the consequences of the victory. That the Mayor-elect was so
prompt and firm in making them shows that he had carefully thought the matter over
from the first, and had made up his mind that if chosen Mayor he would not be the ally
of labor agitators, nor would he put the city government into their hands. He is not a
socialist nor an anarchist, nor a revolutionist of any kind. He is a conservative Republi
can who is opposed to boss rule, but at the same time is equally opposed to the domina
tion of agitators and demagogues. He has made no pledges that will bind him in the
performance of his duties as Mayor. He says: "Above all things I desire the people to
understand that I shall not attempt to inaugurate a class administration."
Upon the showing made by such statements The Call believes the Mayor-elect to
be entitled to a fair trial from the conservative elements of the people. His coming ad
ministration must not be prejudged. There can be no question that Mr. Schmitz is right
in attributing his election less to the supporters of the Labor party than to the revolt of
the independent Republicans against the bosses who obtained control of the Republican
machine and used it for base purposes. Having taken that rightful view of the meaning
of his election, Mr. Schmitz may be expected to act in accord with it when he enters upon
the duties of his office.
Accepting the statements of the newly elected Mayor as being frank and sincere,
and relying upon his firmness to maintain them, The Call will give the new administra
tion a favorable consideration. It will be impartial in everything, and always ready to com
mend whatever the Mayor may do for the general good. None the Less it will fearlessly
point out any errors he may make and condemn whenever condemnation is justly incurred.
In short Mr. Schmitz has given good promises, and we shall help hisi to live up to them.
THE BRITISH DEBT.
SIR MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH, Chancellor of
the Exchequer of Great Britain, has warned the
taxpayers of the country that they must expect
an increase of the national debt and an increase of
taxation next year by reason of the enormous expen
ditures required for the war in South Africa and the
increase of the navy. Mr. John Morley, a Liberal
member of Parliament, speaking about the same
time, has pointed out that the annual expenditures of
the Government have increased during the last ten
years by Â£26,000,000, and that if the suspension of the
sinking fund be counted the increase has amounted
to Â£32,000,000.
These and similar statements made by financiers of
all parties show that the British people have begun
to take a very serious view of the financial situation
of the empire. From the close of the Napoleonic
wars down to the last year or two the British bore
their huge public debt without anxiety. In fact, they
developed a theory that a public debt is a public
blessing, and they looked upon the loans of the Gov
ernment with satisfaction rather than dismay. There
were many reasons for that attitude of the public
mind toward the question. The debt was being di
minished, industry and trade were increasing, Great
Britain was becoming the creditor of the whole
world, the burden of taxation required to meet the
expenditures of the Government was becoming
lighter, and the savings of the people invested in the
postal savings banks were rapidly absorbing the
debt.
A recent review of the history of the British na
tional debt shows that it was at its highest in the
year 1836, when it amounted to the enormous sum of
Â£853,000,000. From that point onward the effort was
made to take steps toward reducing this national ob
ligation. There were years in which this effort was
unsuccessful, but on the whole the attempt was cred
itably held to, so that in the year 1899 the national
debt of the United Kingdom had been reduced to the
sum of Â£635,000,000; that is, the English debt in
two-thirds of a century had been reduced by more
than $1,000,000,000.
That showing was highly gratifying to the tax
payers. They looked forward to the speedy coming
of a time when the public debt would be virtually ex
tinguished. In fact, the directors of the postal sav
ings banks began to complain that there were no
funds in which to invest the deposits so as to pay in
terest on them. Very different is the situation now.
In spite of the heavy increase of taxation the rev
enues fall far short of the expenditures and the Gov
ernment has had to borrow money to carry on its
operations. Moreover, while the debt is increasing
the industrial and commercial supremacy of Great
Britain is passing away. British financiers, therefore,
have awakened to the disagreeable truth that while
their expenditures are growing the means of meeting
them are diminishing. They perceive that there is a
real danger ahead of the empire, and one that cannot
be evaded. It must be met. The British taxpayer
must prepare himself to pay heavier taxes, even
though the income from his business may have de
clined.
It is a curious illustration of the way in which
seemingly small causes produce great results, that a
war against a petty people in the wilds of South
Africa should have brought the richest empire the
world has ever seen to a condition that threatens
something like bankruptcy. Of course the British
can pay out, and that without having to bear such
onerous taxation as rests upon the people of Conti
nental Europe, but none the less their debt is going
to trouble them in more ways than one.
There has been a general victory for "fusion
tickets" in New York, Pennsylvania and in this city,
and now we shall see how long the victors can
operate practical politics without confusion.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1901.
A MASSACHUSETTS MUDDLE.
MASSACHUSETTS does not give much,
thought to matters of politics. Her people
p.'C aware the Republican ticket is always
safe in their State, and they do not concern them
selves much about what happens in other States.
Consequently they have time and attention to
give to a discussion of what they doubtless regard as
more important problems, problems that afford more
opportunities for original thought and a display of
more skill in dialectics.
The problem upon which the wise men of Boston
p.nd of the surrounding country are engaged at present
is that of determining when a man is drunk. It is
not an idle question, nor is the discussion of it con
fined to philosophers. The Judges of the courts are
debating it with judicial solemnity and the press is
arguing it with vigor. It is, in fact, a live issue and
is treated as such.
The debate arose in this way: In charging a jury
in a divorce case a Judge told the jury they were not
to accept as conclusive the testimony of a woman as
to whether a man was drunk on a particular occasion.
The charge gave rise to some criticism, and the
Judge, by way of putting a stop to it, asked the ques
tion, "When is a man drunk?" The query raised a
commotion at once. The Boston Transcript says:
"Imagine the consternation of officials and of the
public when a learned Judge, without previous warn
ing, propounds the question, 'When is a man drunk?'
Of official definitions explaining the word drunk
there is apparently none satisfactory in the Â»law
books, and the traditional view of the police has been
already condemned. How decide?"
Face to face with this poser and with no help from
statutes or from Supreme Court decisions it was de
termined by some of the Police Judges to rely upon
the dictionary. Alas! that availed them little, for
according to the Century a man is drunk when "over
come, stupefied or frenzied by alcoholic liquor." The
Transcript says: "In the mind of the police the new
definition worked utter confusion. Their old
fashioned notions, based upon years of experience and
observation, were upset, and they knew not how to
make arrests according to the Century Dictionary's
requirements."
One of two Judges boldly declared they will not be
bound by the definition given in the dictionary. They
assert a man can be drunk without being overcome,
stupefied or frenzied. One of these says: "If the
courts should hold that to constitute the crime of
drunkenness it would be necessary to prove that a
man was overcome or helplessly drunk it would not
be safe for law-abiding people to live in the commun
ity." That sounds like common sense, and yet it does
not give a definition of drunkenness nor set forth the
sign* by which it can be distinguished. The issue,
therefore, remains as doubtful as it was before, and
much more muddled. It is to be noted, moreover,
that the whole controversy is drifting away from the
original pomt â that of deciding whether or no a
woman's testimony as to the drunkenness of a man is
of legal value.
Those sanguine persons who predicted that under
our beneficent rule the Filipinos would soon acquire
an understanding of American government were
right. There is already a movement in Manila to ask
for State government and the Tight to elect Aguin
aldo to the United States Senate.
It has been a bad year for machine politics every
where from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast. It seems
to have been "wireless" voting all along the line.
We shall next hear of Seth Low as candidate for
Go.ernor of New York, and after that it will be time
to talk about the Presidency.
There appear to be just enough Democrats left in
Ohio to form a Coroner's jury in every county and
hold an inquest on the party remains.

SAYS LAWYERS
WERE WATCHED
Captain Mercer Testifies
Against Examiner C.
A. S. Frost.
The so-called Nome contempt case was
taken up again yesterday. Witness Coch
ran's long story of Nome history was
hurriedly run over in cross-examination,
and then Captain John F. Mercer was
placed upon the stand by the amicus cu
riae. He is the last of the Government
witnesses and an effort is being made tt
show by his testimony that C. A. S. Frost
used the Marsnals of Nome lor private
detective work.
Mercer testified that within a week
aftw his arrival C. A. S. Frost spoke to
him about the employment of detectives
to watch Judge Johnson, W. H. Metson,
Samuel Knignt, Charles D. Lane. Ken
neth M. JacKsou and other attorneys. The
witness said Frost introduced him to 3.
J. Garret, who refused to act as a spy on
other people. George Carson was aftei -
ward employe.!, also George I>. McLain
and a man named Harrow. These men
reported orally and also in writing. Ac
cording to the testimony the witness over
heard many conversations between th-;
detectives and Frost. Once Frost tod
Mercer that there would be a raid on th?
bank to take possession of the gold dusr,
and that this must be prevented at any
cost.
One of the conversations between Frost
and Mercer was full of moment. On the
stand the witness testified: "Frost said
the gold must Le protected, and if neces
sary the Marsnal must swear in a posse
comitatus. He said the gold must be pro
tected against the Lane crowd."
"What did Frost say about Judge Noycs
and the writs?" asked Pillsbury.
"He said Judge Noyes would do as he
pleased about them." replied the witness.
The cross-examination continued
throughout the greater part of the after
noon. Nothing of any great importance
developed. Judge Noyes will probably
take the stand to-day.

Files Suit for Damages Against
Bakers' Union, Alleging It Con

William Weber is suing Bakers' Union
No. 24 for $5000 damages, which he al
leges he suffered by reason of a conspir
acy formed by the members of the union
to prevent him from working at his trade
of baker. Weber alleges that he was ex
pelled from the union without his knowl
edge, and that the union after expelling
him compelled his employer, John Langs
dorf, to discharge him. He secured a po
sition in Alameda, and was discharged be
cause the union, he alleges, threatened to
boycott his employer if he was kept at
work. He then secured a position with
Ruediger & Loesch, and he alleges the
union is boycotting the bakery owned by
them because they refuse to discharge
him. He asks that a receiver be appoint
ed to take charge of the funds of the
union until the suit is determined, and
that an order be issued from the court
restraining the union from boycotting any
firm by which he is employed.

SMITH AND GREENBEHG
INDICTED AND ARBESTED
Charges Preferred Against the Fed
eral Official and He Will Lose
His Job.
E. \Y. Smith and Leopold Greenberg, in
dicted by the Federal Grand Jury for sell
ing worthless notes of the defunct State
Bank of New Brunswick to a gang of
note passers, were arrested yesterday by
United States Marshal Shine on bench
warrants issued by United States District
Judge de Haven. They were released on
filing bonds in the sum of $3000 each.
Smith and Greenberg are proprietors of
a curiosity store on Montgomery street,
and some months ago they imported from
New Jersey a large quantity of the notes
of the defunct bank, printed from genu*
me plates. Some of these notes were se
creted by Smith in the storehouse of the
United States Life Saving Service, un
known to Major Thomos J. Blakeney, the
superintendent of the service, Smith being
at the time a clerk in the major's office.
For this indiscreet act, savoring of guilty
knowledge of the use to which the notes
were to be put, charges were preferred to
the department against Smith, and he will
probably lose his Job as a Federal official.

EL PASO, Tex., Nov. 6.â The relations
between the Southern Pacific and Bisbee
Railway are still strained and the bitter
feeling between the forces of the contend
ing companies is increasing. In the vicin
ity of this city the situation is critical and
the decision in the injunction suit Is
awaited with interest as trouble is almost
sure to follow.
A dispatch from Alamo Gordo, N. M.,
to-day, where the attorneys are arguing
the motion to dismiss the injunction,
Btates that the officials there were notified
that a conflict between the rival forces
of the workmen at Deming, N. M., had
taken place, resulting in the death of
four men.
This report is not confirmed by railway
noen here, but it is stated that the Bisbee
forces overpowered four guards at Dem
ing, seized a Southern Pacific switch en
gine and removed ninety cars of building
material from the Southern Pacific yards
to the Bisbee sidings.
The Southern Pacific had held up this
material and the work of the Bisbee con
tractors was. being interfered with. A
raid was accordingly planned and suc
cessfully carried out, but if bloodshed re
sulted the officials here know nothing
about it.

Hopes to Exterminate Wild
Beasts That Are Annoy
ing Ranchers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 6.â A family of moun
tain lions has been terrorizing the district
surrounding the Hidden Villa, near the
Arnold ranch, in the mountains in the
western part of the county, for a month
past. There is an old lion, a lioness and
a nest of cubs. They have played havoc
with the stock in that section, and their
depredations have become so bold that it
has been determined to hold a lion hunt
to exterminate them. Pigs, goats and
ther small farmyard stock nave been
carried away, and a colt, belonging to
Rancher Singles in that neighborhood,
was killed and devoured. The Hidden
Villa was a favorite spot for many deer,
but they have all been frightened away
by the lions. Several times ranchers have
come upon the lion family, but each time
they escaped bullets fired at them.
To-morrow Deputy Sheriff J. D. Martin
and a party of hunters from Mountain
View, with a pack of hounds, will begin
a hunt for the lions. Ranchers will Join
them. The party will be gone several
days.

AUTOLIGHT BREAKS A COAST RECORD
IN DEFEATING BARBARA FRIETCHIE
Hagerdon Also Blossoms Out as a High-Class Sprinter,
Equaling the Oakland Track Record â Surprises Were
Furnished by Ben Ledi and Artilla, Both Rank Outsiders
AFTER standing the bombardment
for six years the coast record for
a mile and seventy yards of 1:44%,
made by Remus at the old Bay
District track, was lowered to
1:44 by Autolight in the fourth event at
Oakland yesterday. Green Morris' shifty
colt, carrying 110 pounds, had for pace
maker Barbara Frietchie. It was the
Eastern filly's first start, but she appeared
tuned to concert pitch, measuring off the
first mile in 1:40 flat. Autolight is a rare
good stretch runner and when O'Connor
shook him up he passed 'he filly, winning
by more than two lengths. Articulate is
apparently rounding into form, -for the
brown fellow finished a close third.
The track was lightning fast and the
large crowd attending was treated to
some splendid sport. Besides the record
smashing performance of the Morris
horse, Hagerdon, carrying 117 pounds, ran
five furlongs in 1:00, equaling the track
record, made by Aluminum-, with a
"catch" up. For those who like to play
around the favorites, Ben Ledi stole in at
15 and Artilla at 20 to 1. Only two choices
were elected.
80 open did the introductory sprint look
that 3 and 4 to 1 could be had about any
of the starters, though Doublet eventually
went to the post favorite. He was raced
to a standstill by Frank Bell, which
sprinter was in turn collared by Hagerdon
and beaten out three lengths. Johnny
Woods had the leg up on the winner.
Jack Atkins' fast piece of equine
mechanism, Glendenning, ran circles
around the other starters in the futurity
course sprint for two-year-olds. The St.
Carlo youngster ruled a 1 to 2 chance and
won by himself, six lengths before Ino
cencia. Parizade chased the winner for
seven panels and then fell back from the
firing line.
Everybody had a bet down on Tower of
Candles to win the six-furlong sprint which
followed and the filly proved an awful
disappointment. Backed to 3 to 5 favorit
ism, O'Connor had the mare in his lap
for three furlongs, but when she was let
down went all to pieces. Winslette,
astride Ben Ledi, a 15 to 1 shot, then led
Bernota out five lengths.
P. Ryan started Obia back in the seven
furlong number, but her race of the pre
ceding day and the weight she was giving
away proved too much of a handicap.
Bringing up Impromptu from the rear di
vision, Jesse Matthews got home first with
the colt nearly two lengths in advance of
Horton. Five to 1 was laid about the win
ner.
Simply from the fact that O'Connor had
the mount on Free Lance, the ring made
Harry Stover's horse a 6 to 5 chance. He
was never prominent. Riding an excel
lent race on Artilla, Birkenruth landed his
mount first at the stand in a head finish
with See on Lizella.
Track Notes.
ft flippatrll from Louisville, Ky., yes
terday states that Barney Schreiber has
securod the services of Jockey Johnny
Dugan for the California season. Barn?y
will be here *-lthin the coming two weeks.
Among ihe visitors at the track yester
day was William A. Pinkerton, of the
great detective agency. Mr. Pinkerton !s
a great admirer of the turf.
M. J. Daly is back In California -with a
small but select stable. He says his two
boys, Johnny and L. Daly, will be here
shortly.
The American debut of the English
horse Royal Flush could not be termed *>
success. He was one of eight starters in
the opening sprint and O'Connor fatied to
get away whea the barrier was released
rie was well backed by the stable con
nections.
School for Scandal seems unable to get
away from the barrier. She will one of
these days and that will be the end of
the story, for the filly is very fast.
It Is said Tom Ryan holds an option on
both Glendenning and Achilles, now
owned by Jack Atkins.
Down in the paddock Barbara FrietehJe.
owned by Mrs. Madge Cone, was the cy
nosure of many eyes. This was because of
a $10 lÂ«ill being braided in the headstall of
the filly with a piece of ribbon. This it
appears was a custom in vogue down in
some of the Southern States "befo the
wah " and was slipped out by the rider if
successful in landing his mount first.
Justus Goebel took the barrier with him
in the start of the last race. One end of
the webbing caught Hoar, who had the
mount on Miss Vera. brushing him flrom
her back as a feather duster would a fly.
The bey's breathing apparatus was tem
porarily disarranged, and that was about
all. The mare ran away over a mile.
P. Sheridan is still on the trail of Frank
Doss. After Impromptu polished off Hor
ton his sellinjr price of J7OO was tilted to
$1000 bj- Sheridan.

JOE BERNSTEIN WINS
A WRESTLING BOUT
Throws Gus Fredericks Twice in
Thirty-Seven Minutes in His
Ellis-Street Gymnasium.
Joe Bernstein won a hotly contested
wrestling bout in his Ellis street gym
nasium Tuesday night. His opponent was
Gus Fredericks, who weighed about 155
pounds to the champion's 128. Bernstein
contracted to throw him twice within an
hour and succeeded. After twenty-nine
minutes' wrestling he threw him, using
the "scissors hold." "Wimout a moment's
rest heywent at .im again, and in eight
mir.utes had both shoulders on the floor.
This time he used the "double-lock hold"
and roll.
Fredericks showed great strength and
endurance. Bernstein applied the deadly
strangle hold once and kept up the pres
sure until his opponent was blue in the
face. Fredericks finally broke the hold.
The gymnasium was comfortably filled
with spectators.
Kane and Queenan to Fight.
Boxer Jack Kane of this city and Perry
Queenan of Chicago will meet to-night for
the second time in the gymnasium of the
Reliance Athletic Club, Oakland. At their
last meeting Kane went in at short notice
to take the place of Harry Lewis. For thir
teen rounds the brace of lightweight box
ers stood in the center of the ring and
exchanged blow for blow. Kane's lack
of condition then commenced to tell on
him, and the best he could do was to
make it a draw. Both men have been
anxious for a return match and their
wishes will be gratified to-night. The at
tendance is expected to be unusually
large as the bout is a promising one.

SHIPS CORPSES
AS MACHINERY
Purchaser of Cadavers
Grievously Violates
the Law.
Chicago Police Called On to
Investigate a Grew
some Case.
CHICAGO, Nov. 6.â Eight human bodies
were taken this evening from two crate*
at the freight station of the Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy Railroad. They were
consigned to R. J. Jones of Brashear, Mo.,
and marked as second-hand laundry ma
chinery.
The bodies were purchased during the
day from the Harvey Medical College of
this city, and were being shipped to Mis
souri for the purpose of dissection. The
police are looking for Jones, but so far
have been unable to locate him. The only
charge that can be brought against him
is the shipping of bodies in a manner con
trary to law.
When the crates were received at the
freight station the suspicions of the men
in charge were aroused as they had never
seen laundry machinery of the shape of
the two crates, nor had they ever seen
it shipped in such a manner. It was de
cided to open the crates and determine if
their contents were really laundry ma
chinery. When they were opened the
bodies, sewed up in canvas and packed in
excelsior, were found.
The police were notified and as it was
known that the crates came from the
Harvey Medical College officers were at
once sent there. The officials of the col
lege proved that they had no connection
with the shipment of the bodies, and said
that they had sold them during the after
noon to R. J. Jones, who said that he
intended to ship them to Brashear, Mo.
"I told him to be careftil how he shipped
thorn," said Dr. Dickinson of the college,
"and warned h!m that he would gtt into
trouble if he sent them in any other way
than that authorized by law. He said
nothing and went away. As far as the
college is concerned the transaction was
entirely proper. We had more cadavers
than we could use, and sold those to
Jones, as he called himself. He said that
they were to be used for medical pur
poses."

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A Daily Nuisance,
A Simple Remedy Which Will In-
terest Catarrh Sufferers.
In its earlier stages catarrh Is more of
t a nuisance than a menace to the general
health, but sooner or later, the disease
extends to the throat, bronchial tubes
and even to the stomach and intestines.
Catarrh is essentially a disease of tho
mucous membrane, the local symptoms
being a profuse discharge of mucus,
stoppage of the nostrils, irritation in
throat, causing coughing, sneezing, gag-
ging and frequent clearings of the throat
and head.
The usual treatment by local douches,
snuffs, salves, etc., often gives temporary
relief, but anything like a cure can only
be obtained by a treatment which removes
the catarrhal taint from the blood and
the disappearance of the inflammation
from the mucous surfaces.
A new remedy which meets these re-
quirements and which so far has been re-
markably successful in curing catarrh is
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
These tablets act upon the blood and
mucous membranes only. They can hard-
ly be called a secret patent medicine as
they are composed of such valuable rem-
edies as Sanguinaria, Hydrastin, Euealyp-
tol and similar cleansing antiseptics which
cure by eliminating from the blood and
mucous surfaces the catarrhal poison.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are large,
pleasant tasting lozenges takerr 7 internally,
allowing them to dissolve slowly in the
mouth; in this way they reach the throat,
fauces and the entire alimentary canal.
If desired, they may also be dissolved
in water and used as a douche, in addi-
tion to the. internal use, but it is not at
all necessary to use a douche; a few of
them dissolved in the mouth daily will
be sufficient. However, when there is
much stoppage of the nose, a douche
made frc*n these tablets will give, imme-
diate relief, but the regular daily use in-
ternallj of these tablets will cure the
whole catarrhal trouble without resorting
to the inconvenience of a douche.
Dr. Bement states "that the internal
treatment for catarrh is rapidly taking
the place of the old plan of douching, an 4
local application and further says that
probably the bes*t and certainly the safest
remedy at present on the 'market is Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets, as no secret is
made of their composition and all the
really efficient remedies for catarrh are
contained in this tablet."
Druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
at fifty cents for full sized packages. Ask
your druggist and if he is honest he will
tell you there is no safer, more palatable,
more efficient and convenient remedy on
the market.

BOILERS
Require Strong Workmen to Con-
struct.
A big, hustling boilermaker down at
Niles, 0., had an experience with Grape-
Nut* Food that is worth knowing. George
Preston says there was a time -when Ms
appetite for breakfast failed him, and it
came from stomach trouble caused by his
way of eating.
v He -"irould get hungry from his work
W>out i) or 10 o'clock, but was not allowed
to eat during working hours, and when
dinner time came he would overeat an 1
would be in misery the rÂ«Â»st of the day,
and net able to eat any supper.
He says: "I was troubled with head-
aches and was co dizzy from stooping
over that I would stagger when straight-
ening up.
"Grape-Xuts being called to my atten-
tion I zook a package to my boarding
place md had some for breakfast, and
J did not get hungry until near the noon
hour. I now knew what was the matter
with xrie. I began to eat a good, healthy
;md it agreed with me, so I have
kept on using Grape-Nute for breakfast
with a little cream.
"I have never taken one drop of medi-
rine, only once for sore throat, but I an
:â¢ well and hearty as any man that
walks, and I know how to keep my
g ;h now by the use of good food, and
t think I would lose a part of it if I left
rff Grsipe-Xuts. This food has been bet-
ter to me and my family than any medi-
cine.
"I am at Nile*. Ohio, and ready to show
the truth of what I write. Any one can
fl^ ard see me and my family and Judge
)m th*maelves whether we are healthy or
lot. I have used 221 packages of Grape -
fc'uts since I began."

SLAYER OF SHERMAN
TO BE TRIED FOE MTTRDEH
Counsel for Harry L. Elliott Will At
tempt to Free Him on Insanity
Plea.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 6.â Harry L. Elliott,
who killed J. W. Sherman on October 27,
in a North Market street house, was to
day, at his preliminary examination be
fore Justice Cobb, held to answer to a
charge of murder. The principal witness
was Mrs. Bessie Sherman, wife of the
murdered man and over whom the shoot
ing occurred. She repeated the same story
she had told at the inquest. Mrs. Sher
man said she first met her husband in
a dance hall on Larkin street, San Fran
cisco, and six weeks later they were mar
ried. She had known Elliott for five years
and had received numerous letters from
him, in which he wrote madly of love and
marriage.
Elliott did not take the stand. His de
fense will be insanity. He has been act
ing queerly since his confinement in jail,
is morose and refuses to talk. Some are
inclined to think he is insane, and not
merely shamming. A rich uncle of his in
Cincinnati, 0., has employed Attorney
Louis Oneal to defend him.
Chamberlain Arouses Germans.
BERLIN, Nov. 6.â The demonstrations
against the reflections cast upon the con
duct of the German troops in the Franco-
Prussian war by Joseph Chamberlain in
his Edinburgh speech continue. A num
ber of societies of veterans and organisa
tions composed of the clergy have pro
tested. At a meeting held in Berlin to
night Professor Wagner and others spoke
in denunciation of the British Colonial
Secretary's utterances. The students of
Leipslc University have issued a call for
an indignation meeting.
Chanler Is Not Insane.
RICHMOND, Va.. Nov. 6.â To-day the
Albemarle County Court heard the peti
tion to appoint a committee for John
Armstrong Chanler, the divorced husband
of Amelie Rives, now the Princess Trou
betzky, the allegation being that Chanler
was insane. After examining a number
of witnesses the court refused the peti
tion, holding that nowhere did the testi
mony show insanity. This decision settled
the question of Chanler's ability to man
age his own property interests in Virginia,
which will now be turned over to him.

Another strong success of the week is
"The Belle of New York" at the TlvoU,
given by the clever | youngsters of the

children are v the brightest young folks
that have ever been seen or heard here,
singing, acting and dancing with all the

have succeeded, from, the tiny Daphne
Pollard to Alice Pollard, the stately, who
is nearlng the sere and yellow leaf of 14

JOE HARVEY SAYS ADOLPH SYLVA
SWINDLED HIM OUT OF PROPERTY
Poolroom Owner Alleges Attorney Was Given Money^tc
Purchase Partnership for Him, but That by Tricks He
Secured Same for Himself With the Aid of His Sister
CHARCINC SYLVA WITH FRAUD.
yOSEPH HARVEY, the poolroom operator and gambler, filed suit yesterday in the Superior
Court of Marin County against Adolph Sylva, the political boss of Sausalito, in zvhich charges of
fraud are made against the man who came into notoriety through the Fair will case. Harz-ex
alleges that he gave Sylva $4000 to purchase for him a half interest in the Sausalito Electric Light
Works, and that Sylva, by cunning and trick, secured the property in the name of a partner named
Frost and then induced Frost to transfer the same to Florence Sylva, his sister. Attorney James IV.
Cochrane of San Rafael represents Harvey in the suit.
to-rrsIHERE is war in the camp of the
I poolsellers of the pretty little
I town of Sausalito. No longer do
il Joseph Harvey and Adolph Sylva
quaff the gentle cocktail or the
brew of Gambrinus together, for the for
mer charges Sylva with having given him
the "double cross" and in the words of a
long complaint filed by Attorney James
W. Cochrane in the County Clerk's office
of Marin County last evening accuses
Sylva of having cheated him out of a
half-interest in the electric light works
of Sausalito and of having conveyed the
same to Florence Sylva, his sisLer and
agent.
Harvey and Sylva are well known in
sporting circles in California. Harvey for
years was a familiar figure at the race
tracks and other places where men tempt
fortune and "Harvey's wheel of fortune"
has caused many to regret having "gone
up against his game."
Sylva for some time was the "boss" of
Sausalito, and when the gamblers were
driven out of San Francisco he shocked
the residents of the little town across the
bay by using his influence to allow pool
rooms to run wide open in the respectable
suburban place.
Sylva also came into notoriety in the
Fair case in bolstering up the claims of
Mrs. Nettie Craven that she was the
widow of the dead millionaire, and with
other witnesses was indicted for perjury.
Sylva and Harvey became close friends
when the last named ran his poolrooms
in Sausalito and it was alleged that Sylva
had an Interest in the gambling places.
Harvey Accuses Adolph Sylva.
According to the complaint of Harvey,
filed yesterday evening. Sylva came to
him in April last and requested that he,
Harvey, loan the sum of $4000 to Thomas
G. Frost, one of the proprietors of the
Sausalito Electric Light Works. Frost
had established the light works in July,
1896, his partner being Thomas E. Scully.
In April last Frost and Scully decided to
dissolve partnership and it was agreed
that Frost should buy out his partner's
interest, which was valued at $4000.
Frost hired Sylva to act as his attorney
and agent in the matter and it was in
this capacity that Sylva approached Har
vey and tried to make a "touch" for $4000.
Harvey, however, refused to make the
loan to Sylva on Frost's behalf, but
agreed t" purchase the half-interest in I

the electric light works for the purpose
of assisting Frost, who was a friend.
Harvey alleges that he gave Sylva $4000
to purchase tor him the half-interest in
the electric light works owned by Scully
and which was sold by order of court on
May 6, 1901, at the San Rafael Courthouse.
It was agreed, claims Harvey, that
Sylva was simply to act as his agent and
that the purchase should be in Harvey's
name and that the title to the property
should be transferred to Harvey. It was
also agreed that if the property was sold
for less than $4000 the balance of the
money in Sylva's hands should be re
turned to Harvey. The complaint alleges
that Sylva attended the sale of the prop
erty at San Rafael Courthouse, but old
in the half-interest in the Sausallto Elec
tric Light Works in the name of Thomas
G. Frost for the sum of $3500 25.
Harvey alleges that Sylva had the half
interest transferred to Thomas G. Frost
and used hjs influence with the latter to
induce him to then transfer the property
to Florence Sylva. his sister. Frost, rely
ing on Sylva, and having confidence in
him, says the complaint, did as requested,
and the half interest in the electric light
works, purchased Â¦with Harvey's money,
was thus transferred from Scully to Frost
and then on to Sylva's sister.
Alleges Fraudulent Conveyance.
Harvey alleges that no consideration
passed for the conveyance from Frost to
Florence Sylva, and that the latter, who
resides with her brother, simply acted as
his agent in furtherance of his scheme to
cheat and defraud Harvey.
Sylva is then accused of bolstering up
his plans by inducing Frost to execute
articles of co-partnership with Florence
Sylva, which articles recite that Frost
and the woman are each the owners of
an undivided one-half of all the property
formerly owned by the firm of Frost &
Scully, and that Frost and Florence Sylva
had each contributed to the new co-part
nership as their contribution to the part
nership assets the undivided one-hatf in
terest each owned in the Sausalito Elec
tric Light Works.
Harvey's Eyes Axe Opened.
When Harvey finally tried to claim the
property which he had instructed Sylva to
purchase for him he ran up against a
snag. He was confronted by Florences
Sylva, who informed him that she was
the owner of half the Sausalito Electric
Light Works and that the other half be
longed to Frost. Harvey admitted that
Frost rightly was the owner of half the
property but claimed the otner half. Flor

ACTORS PERISH
IN THE FLAMES
Lives Are Lost in a Dis
astrous Blaze in
Wisconsin.
HURLEY, Wis., Nov. 6.â The Klondike
Theater, owned by Edward Le Clalr,
caught fire early to-day while most of the
inmates were in bed and the wooden
structure was soon a mass of fire. Nine
men and one woman are missing and
there may be others who have lost then
lives in the fire.
The dead are:
C. W. CLEVELAND, attorney, Hurley.
TOM RYAN, comedian. Ironwood. Mich.
F. L. GAY, stage manager, St. Louis.
THOMAS OZZONNE, property man.
THOMAS LE CLAIR, bartender, brother
of owner.
H. H. CLIFFORD, comedian.
HARRY RAYMOND, porter.
GEORGE BENERT. pugilist.
CLARA BONNE, vocalist.
D. B. MEYER, musician.
The injured are: Jennie Bender, sou
brette, burned, may die: Laura Russell,
musician, badly bruised; William Rush
bolt, barber, Ironwood, Mich., face cut;
William McLaughlin, second cook, burned,
may die; Ella Hess, vocalist, bruised and
burned.
The Klondike Theater building was a
structure 125 feet long, three stories high
and 50 feet wide, and valued at $10,000. It
was occupied by twenty-five people, con
sisting of the Le Clair family and a. stock
company, which gave a vaudeville enter
tainment six nights a week. On the first
floor was the auditorium, barroom, gam
bling rooms, dressing rooms, kitchen, din
ing rooms, stage and proprietor's bed
room. On the second floor were the boxes
and a number of rooms. The third floor
was partitioned into sleeping apartments.
The fire is thought to have been caused
by the explosion of an oil stove in the
proprietor's bedroom. When the alarm
was sounded the flames had cut off exit
by the stairway. The only remaining e*tt
was through the side and front windows.
Some of the women crawled through the
side windows! dropped to the adjoining
buildings and reached the ground with
slight injuries.
Laura Russell, of the musical team of
Meyer and Russell, was thrown from the.
third story by her partner, D. M. Meyer,
and fell heavily to the sidewalk, sustain
ing a broken elbow, and was badly
bruised. Meyer is thought to have tried
to rescue or alarm his friends, for he did
not follow through the window. He lost
his life. William Rushbolt. an Ironwood,
Mich., man, jumped from the second story
and in his fall was caught by a telephone
wire and turned over in the air. He fell
on his face and side and had his limb 3
broken. His recovery is uncertain.
Clara Bonne, the only woman victim,
was warned of the danger but, after start
ing for safety, returned to her room. It
is supposed she hoped to secure a portion
of her jewelry and wardrobe. Frank L.
Gay, the stage manager, had been in his
room about an hour when the fire broke
out, and no one saw him after he left
the dressing room. Seven bodies of the
missing have been found, but their iden
tity cannot be determined.

told him to "go way back and sit down. "
Harvey, however, consulted his attorney.
When Harvey had a talk with Froat he
was informed that Sylva had told Frost
that all the transactions in the purchase
and trajisfer of half the property wmrn
known to Harvey and that Harvey had
desired the transfer to be made to Flor
ence Sylva. Frost informed Harvey that
as Sylva was his attorney and he had
faith in him, all Sylva's requests had been
complied with.
When Harvey approached Sylva and
asked him many times to return the bal
ance of the $4000 left over after the pur
chase of the half interest in the electric
light works .Harvey was told that the bal
ance had been used to satisfy a mortgage
on the property. Harvey says that when
he asked Sylva for his tule to the prop
erty he was told that the transaction ha I
not been completed on account of the
mortgage.
Recently Discovers the "Job."
Harvey says that as Sylva was his at
torney and agent and that he had every
confidence in him he accepted Sylva'3
statements as being true, and only re
cently discovered that he had been
"jobbed."
Harvey, in his complaint, asks the Su
perior Court of Marin County to grant
him an injunction to prevent Adolph Syl
va, Florence Sylva, Thomas G. Frost and
Lisette Frost, as individuals, and Frost
and Florence Sylva. as co-partner 3, from
transferring, assigning, selling or dispos
ing of any part of the half interest in tha
Sausalito Electric Light Works, pur
chased by Sylva with Harvey's money
and transferred to Florence Sylva in a
fraudulent manner.
Harvey also as4cs that a receiver be ap
pointed to tEtke charge of the lighting
wcrks to prevent any division of the prof
its of the business and also asks that he
b,e declared the owner of the half interest
m the property described in his complaint.
He further prays that the co-oartnership
between Frost and Florence Sylva be de
clared null and void and that the defend
ants, with the exception of Frost, be pro
hibited from interfering with or handling
the property in question.
A second complaint was also filed by
Harvey to recover the sum of $499 75,
which, he claims, is the balance of cash
belonging to him out of the $4000 he hand
ed to Sylva to purchase the half interest
for Harvey in the electric light works.
The second complaint asks for an at
tachment against the property held in the
name of Florence Sylva. but which prop
erty is alleged to be owned by Adolph
Sylva, her brother.

The Business Outlook.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"With so many uncertainties in the financial
atmosphere and attention to business some
what diverted by the excitement of a political
campaign, the time is not propitious lor any
organized bull movement. It may be argued
that there is very little material for a bear
campaign, and this is true, except for the high
jirices at which some stocks are ruling, the
weakness of the Industrials and the unsatis
factory state of affairs abroad. These are facts
that must not be forgotten. Competitive bid
ding for control has carried some stocks many
joints above their true value, rendering them
extremely dangerous to marginal holders, be
cause the time must come when they will sink
to their intrinsic level. Nor can the evil day
be postponed by changing 6 per cent stocks
into S per cent bonds, cutting â¢ them in two
and selling at par. These are very profitable
transactions for some parties, but stockholders
of the guaranteeing companies are likely to
leel the load when the period of contraction
sets in As for the industrials there is for
tunately little speculation in these: but they
â¢will be the first and most sensitive to any
commercial reaction. Thus far our prosperity
lias been so great that we seem comparatively
indifferent to European depression, yet it must
not be overlooked that any impairment of
Europe's purchasing abilities will inevitably be
reflected here and that the continuance of low
prices in Europe and high prices in the United
States means a check upon our exports and a
stimulus to our imports that will soon put
an end to the phenomenally favorable trade
balances with which we have been congratu
lating ourselves -ing: the past four or five
years. Already there have been symptoms of
a change in the drift of our foreign trade.
. exports having shown two or three declines
and imports a steady growth, and this fact
was emphasized by this weeks shipments of
gold at a time when we are usually importing
gold. Because of our great financial strength
and prosperity it Is argued we can easily spare
considerable sums for Europe's needs, which
xnay be fortunately true, but it does not alter
the fact that our International exchanges are
In a less favorable condition than they have
been for several years. At present we need feel
no serious concern about gold exports, far bank
reserves '.'ill soon bezin to rise and there are
no present indications of important disturbance
In the local money market, especially with Sec
retary Gage's precautionary offer to buy bonds
In an emergency.
"An encouraging feature is the satisfactory
condition of general business. There are no
rieris yet of reaction, and the principal lines
of trade are enjoying another season of un
exampled prosperity. This is true of the entire
country except in the drouth district, where
corn and cotton were badly Injured. The ag
ricultural interests of the country as a whole
are prosperous. Iron has always been con
sidered a good barometer or trade, and if this
lxÂ» true conditions must be satisfactory, for
the great iron mills of the country are run
ning to their fullest capacity, with orders
three and six months ahead at present hleh
prices. Railroad earnings are excellent. The
percentages of gain are not quite so large as
last year; but this is not to be expected and
certainly cannot be construed as a bearish
feature."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market. .
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â To-day's stock market I
was dominated by the authoritative admissions |
from various quarters that the basis had been j
agreed on for the settlement of the Northern
Pacific controversy, although the reports of an I
official announcement were deprecated, as it
was said, details being not yet ready to be
arranged. The arrival from Kurope to-day of |
1 W. K. Vanderbilt, who was named by Mr. \
I Morgan as the final arbitrator of any difficulty
upon which the conciliation board of directors !
might not be able to come to an agreement, 1
helped to incite the large speculative buying
i which was notable among all the transconti
j nental railways. The dealings in Union Pa
i ciSc and St. Paul were on a scale to recall the
1 days of the stock market boom in the spring
lof this year, and the resulting rise in St.
! Paul reached 4% and in Union Pacific 4V4. The
Union Pacific convertible bonds were absorbed
at the same time on an enormous scale. .In
Southern Pacific the rise reached I*4. Great
Northern preferred I*4, Atchison 2% : and in
Northwestern 3T4. Northern Pacific preferred
! fluctuated narrowly, thus suggesting that its j
j present price is near to its valuation under the
! plan. The Southwestern and some of the
Southern stocks afforded another center of ac- |
tivity and strength, based on the series of ex
: traordinarily favorable returns of gross earn
ings for the fourth week in October. The
Southern Railway stocks were also aided by
the vote of Cincinnati In favor of extending
the lease of the Cincinnati Southern. In these j
groups there were gains in Nashville. Chatta- 1
nooga and St. Louis of 3',j. St. Louis and San
Francisco 3V4. Southern Railway preferred 2Tg. I
Missouri Pacific 2%, St. . Louis Southwestern I
preferred 2 and the Denver and Rio Grande j
stocks, Texas and Pacific, Louisville and Nash
ville and Southern Hallway 1%. The increase |
in railway ear-nines for the fourth week in Oc- 1
tober ever those for the corresponding period |
of last year for Missouri Pacific reached 22 per
cent. St. Louis and San Francisco 25 per cent.
Louisville and Nashville 14 per cent and Mis- j
souri, Kansas and Texas 12 per cent.- There ;
were other roads with almost equally striking
gains, but they did not share in the advance, j
A number of specialties were notably weak
early in the day. Including Sugar. Amalga
mated Copper, People's Gas. American Ice and
Metropolitan Street Railway, but except in
Sugar and Amalgamated Copper there were
strong recoveries. In P. C. C. and St. L. pre
ferred. Wells Farso, Pacific Coast. St. Law
, rence and Adirondack. Chicago and Eastern'
Illinois, Buffalo, Rochester and Plttsbun? and
Rutland preferred there were gains of 2 to 3 j
points. . ..Â«.Â«,Â«. Â»_ ; ._ ._ S

London Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram .says:
American stocks opened buoyant and on the
outburst of strength in this department the
market hardened.
Rio Tintos spurted % to 46% with American
issues, which opened strong on an unofficial
announcement of a settlement of the Northern
Pacific situation. The defeat of Tammany,
too, had a good effect, as London regards it as
having an Important bearinc on American
credit. The market on the whole was more
active than for weeks past. Good authoritits
say that it is the beginning of a second boom
Union Pacific led in the advance, but New
York took profits, causing a relapse. The list
picked up on the curb after business. Atchison
being a strong favorite with big calls to the
end of January at Hi per cent. Southern Pa

CHICAGO. Nov. 6.â Wheat opened stronger
and higher on a strong cable list. There was
a good commission house demand early and
December opened %@%c advanced at 72%@72%c.
Prices even went to 72% c for a few moments,
but. at -that figure > the * rush <Â¦ of ' commission
house orders was overcome by a general dis
position to take profits. The corn market was
acting In a similar manner and when longs- in
both pits began to sell and there was no im
portant bull news to support the market prices
began to slide downward and .at. one . time
touched 71% c. There seemed to â¢be a belief
current that the slump was only temporary and
short covering brought a reaction at the close.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â Liverpool and Paris futures were
higher.
Chicago was firmer at the opening on better
forelpn advices, but local realizing, selling by
elevators and the raiding of the bears caused
a reaction and the market declined somewhat.
Wires to Bolton, De Ruyter & Co. said:
"Broomhall's cable, attributing the Liverpool
strength partially to fears of political compli
cations, excited short selling. There was good
cash buying in New York and St. Louis, how
ever, mainly for French account. The com
mission houses had a good many buying
orders. The speculative feeling was bullish
on prices and the small Argentine crop, and
probable large European needs. Armour's
brokers sold freely and the Northwest also
sold."
Bradstreefs gave stocks as follows: East of
the Rockies, an increase of 1,543.000 bushels;
Europe and afloat, an Increase of SOO.COO; total
Increase, 2.235,000 bushels.

Claim of Prosecution in

trial of the case of the State versus John
Ccnsldine, charged with the murder of
"William L. Meredith, late Chief of Police
Of the fity of Seattle.

Loneliness-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO. Nov. 6.â Nine
years of loneliness has proved too much
for John Ferris' mind, and he was
brought in from the desert to-day by
Constable Le Strange in an insane con
dition. Ferris has been attending the
lonely pumping station at Ludlow, on the
Santa Fe Railroad, ninety miles east of
Barstow. For nine years about the only
Figns of civilization that Ferris has seen
have been in the fleeting glimpse of fly
ing passengers as they whirled past the
little pumping station.
A week ago invisible people began to
talk to Ferris and threatened to do him
harm. He is now In the County Hospital,
awaiting examination by a lunacy com
mission.
TROOPS WATCH
FOR UPRISING
Great Precautions Being
Taken on Island of
Leyte.
MANILA. Nov. 6.â The recent develop
ment? in the island of Samar have caused
the military authorities to take extraor
dinary precautions in the island of Leyte.
Provincial Governor Grant objects to
these on the ground that, by reducing the
authority of the civil Governor, they set
a bad example to the people.
In a communication to Vice Governor
Wright Grant says that although three
presidentes have been arrested in Leyte
for treasonable correspondence with the
insurgents these people have not repre
sented the islanders generally, who ap
preciate the blessings of civil government.
In the main, according to Grant, the na
tives of Leyte arc quiet and subdued.
They fear, moreover, that they may be
mistaken for the natives of Samar. They
have been powerless to refuse the de
mands made upon them by Lukban for
food and assistance, owing to the refusal
of General Smith to allow them arms for
telf-protection.

NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â "You can say for
me that Richard Croker never retired un

"would retire. Croker said:
"I am, as you see, right here and I am
here to stay, at least until those whom I
represent express a desire for me to make
way for another. I have no intention of
quitting Tammany Hall. All stories to
the contrary are without foundation and
inspired by malice. This story is all im
agination. I know who is responsbile for
it. He has tried to curry favor with me
and he thought to create a sensation at
my expense. It is a he and the future
will demonstrate it to be such.
"Anybody who thinks that Tammany 13

It was a reverse, but the organization is
possessed of as much power as it ever
Had and in spite of the majority that was
returned against us yesterday the people
have confidence in Tammany, and the

Republican Gains Increase.
COLUMBUS, 0., Nov. 6.-Sixty-twÂ»
counties have Republican pluralities ag
gregating y0,840. Twenty-six counties have
Democratic pluralities aggregating 23,179,
making the plurality of Nasn over Kil
bourne for Governor 67,661 and approxi
mating 80,000 plurality for other candi
dates on the Republican State ticket. The
total vote will not exceed 900,000. The Re
publicans elected sixty-eight Representa
tives and the Democrats forty-two. The
State Senate stands twenty-one Repub
licans and twelve Democrats. The Re
publican majority on joint ballot for
United States Senator is thirty-five. The
official count will not change this figure
on the complexion of the Legislature.
LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 6.â Complete and
nearly complete returns from over a third
of the counties in Nebraska serve to in
crease the pluralities for the Republican
State ticket. U the ratio of gain is main
tained, Sedgwick (R.) for Supreme Judge
will have a plurality of 12,000. Chairman
Lindsay, of the Republican State Commit
tee, says it will not be less than 7000 and
this is conservative. Chairman de France
of the fusion committee- concedes the
election of Sedgwick by 3000 to 5000.
BOSTON, Nov. 6.â Revised and correct
ed returns from the entire State of Mas
sachusetts show that Governor Crane has
a plurality of ''0,116. Revised returns from
the Legislature show that the political
complexion will be as follows: Senate â
3 Republicans, 7 Democrats; House â 165
Republicans, 73 Democrats, 2 Social Dem
ocrats.
Gorman's Chances Brighter.
BALTIMORE. Nov. 6.â Returns received
In this city up to midnight and including
every county in the State, partly official
and partly estimated, indicate a result in
the legislative contest which is almost
without parallel in Maryland. The most
careful estimates and calculations give
the Democrats forty-six delegates and
Beven newly elected Senators, which, com
bined with the ten who hold over in the
Senate, assure the friends of Gorman a
total of sixty-three on Joint ballot. The
Republicans, it appears, have elected for
ty-nine delegates and six Senators, which,
added to their three hold-over Senators,
gives them a total of fifty-eight on Joint
ballot. These figures Indicate that the
Republicans will be able to organize the
House of Delegates.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov.
compltte returns from the State give
Harris (R.) for State Treasurer 52,360 plu
rality and Potter (R.) for Supreme Court
Judge 47,939 plurality. The indications are
that the amendments were carried by a
big majority, although the aggregate vote
on these foil far below that cast for the
State candidates. The total vote cast last

tal was 790,501.

DES MOINES, lowa, Nov. 6.â To-day's
returns from the County Auditors of
lowa indicate that the ultimate official
vote will give A. B. Cummins, the Re
publican Governor-elect, something like
90,000 plurality. The returns on the Legis
lature indicate that the Republicans have
increased their already large majority by
eight or ten. Cummins broke the record
in Dcs Moines County, carrying the
county by a plurality of fourteen. It is
usually strongly Democratic. The Pro
hibition vote of the State is about 17,748,

SPENDS FIVE AND FIFTY YEARS

Aged John Murray, Feeling the Approach of
Death, Writes an Interesting Sketch of
His Varied Experience Upon the Rail
JOHN MURRAY, A PIONEER ENGINEER EMPLOYED BY THE SOUTH

HEART DISEASE AT HIS HOME AT ALAMEDA POINT.
OAKLAND, Nov. 6.â Years before
steam railroads had begun to use
iron rails, John Murray, a pioneer
employe of the Southern Pacific
Company, who died last night
from heart disease, at his Alameda Point
home, was a railroad man. For fifty-five
year, in one capacity or another, the aged
engineer had been connected with rail
roading. He started when the traces
were of wooden stringers, strapped to the
ties by iron bands, and lived to witness a
mechanical and engineering triumph which

CARTER GAINS
A REHEARING
Convicted Army Officer
Has a Chance for
Freedom.
CHICAGO, Nov. 6.â Oberlin M. Carter,
now a convict in the Government prison
at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and formerly
a captain in the United States Engineer
Corps, is to have a rehearing of his case
in a civil tribunal. He now has the as
surance of the Government authorities
that all the. evidence la to be reviewed
again before Judge Kohlsaat in the
United States Circuit Court in this city,
the hearing to take place probably in a
few months. Carter will be called as a
witness in his own behalf, and for the
purpose of testifying in court he will be
released temporarily from his place of
confinement.
This is the result of the suits brought
by the Government some months ago in
several Federal courts for the purpose of
recovering the proceeds of $722,827 which
It was proved at the courtmartial that
Carter had embezzled from the United
States. His uncle, Lorenzo D. Carter, and
his brother, 1. Stanton Carter, were said
to have reinvested this money and se
creted It for the purpose of having a for
tune ready for the former army officer
upon his release from the military prison.
Difficulties were encountered by the
representatives of the Government in get
ting trace of the securities which were
said to represent this amount, and at last
they signed an agreement with Carter's
legal representative, Horace G. Stone, by
which a rehearing of all the charges
brought against the former captain of en
gineers was made possible.
This agreement was filed In the United
States Court to-day, signed by Marion
Erwin, Special Assistant Attorney Gen
eral for the United States, and Attorney
Stone for Carter, his brother and hlÂ«
uncle. The principle provision made In
this stipulation Is that the issues in all
the similar suits now pending in the Fed
eral Courts of New York, New Jersey,
Georgia, West Virginia and the Southern
District of Illinois shall be united with
the case in the Federal Court in Chicago.
The examination of witnesses is to be held
here. The ownership of the bonds and
other securities of Carter, which the Gov
renment claims as its property, will be
determined by the court.
Mrs. James Peaks.
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.-Mrs. James
Peak* who had been connected with the
operatic stage for forty years, died here
to-day, aged 50 years.
system of the new century.
Although his death was not expected,
Murray realized that he had not long to
live. He had reached hiÃ seventy-fifth
year. Less than a month ago he told
some friends that his time must soon
come, and realizing that he had passed an
eventful life as a railroad man, he pre
pared some notes for his biography.
The interesting narrative runs back to
1846, when Murray began as an engine
wiper on the Michigan Central Railroad.
A year later he became a fireman. Then
he went to the Michigan Southern, the
first railroad to enter Chicago. The total
railroad mileage of the State of Illinois
then consisted of ten miles of wooden and
scrap-iron tracks.
The advent of the Iron track began
about that time, and young Murray fol
lowed his fortunes in Ohio and Wisconsin
as engineer. As the new development of
the West increased he worked toward the
setting sun, operating at Fort Wayne, in
Kansas, on the pld Southern route through
Texas, and at last in California, following
the Southern Pacific track building. As
years rolled on the company found posi
tions off the road for the aging railroad
man. He was a collector at Alameda pier
for several years, then had charge of the
pumping station at Alameda Point. Later
he was given a flagman's position, which
he held until his death.
During his long career at railroading
Murray was fortunate in meeting with
only one accident. That occurred many
years ago on the old Fort Wayne and
Chicago railroad when he was a fireman
The engine was derailed and tumbled over
an embankment. The engineer sustained
a fractured leg. Murray was unhurt.
Murray was bom in Ireland, emigrating
to the United States when he was a child"
He leaves a family. The funeral will be
held to-morrow morning at 10:30 o'clock
from St. Joseoh's Church in Alameda.

the University of California were given
their annual glimpse of the captured Stan

The rally began at the gymnasium steps,

the crowd was excluded from the field
while the team went through secret signal

the ax and accompanied by John Eshle
man, president of the student body and
followed by the band, led the procession
to the field. The rooters did the famous
"serpentine" march on the way. Four
men abreast locked arms and together
danced from one side to the other of the
straight line of march, the fours going in
all directions and giving the procession
the wriggling appearance of a serpent.
On the field the men formed In lockstep
and, 800 strong, they extended entirely
ground the neld. Then they formed
wound the side lines and watched the last
line up of the season and cheered
the players for the last time before the
big game Saturday.
At the gymnasium once more rooters
and men and women students gathered
around the north steps, covering the
campus half way back to the gridiron, to
listen to speeches and to witness the
transfer of the ax. Colonel George C.
Edwards, Phil Thayer, Professor Albin
Putzker and Dr. E. J. Wilcxynski spoke,
each causing hearty laughter and cheers
from the listeners and each in turn pre
dicting victory and honor for California
valor, but not without a hard struggle.
Womble and Hudson were gathered in out
of the darkness and the formal transfer
of the ax took place. Hudson pledged
himself to protect it during the year to
come as it has been by former custodians.
So the rally ended, the greatest of the
year. To-morrow night t K e men will hold
a smoker and rally In Harmon gymnas
ium. Several alumni and faculty speakers
will address the gathering. Yell Leader
Smith will t>e In charge of the smoker.
SECRET TALK
ON ARBITRATION
Pan-American Congress
Delegates Discuss
a Treaty.
CITY OF MEXICO. Nov. This morn
ing the Pan-American Congress decided
to go into secret session to hear the pro
ject of the arbitration treaty proposed by
the Mexican delegation. The votes against
the secret session were those of Paraguay
and. the Argentine Republic, Bolivia and
Peru, four against fifteen. The project is
decidedly favorable to Chile and corre
spondingly distasteful to Peru.
The Hague convention, in its article 18.
recognized arbitration as the most effica
cious and equitable means of settling all
questions arising from interpretation and
application of international conventions.
The Mexican project omits this declara
tion, and the omission is an evident tri
umph for Chile, inasmuch as the entire
difference between Chile and Peru hinges
precisely upon the interpretation of the
convention of Ancon.
The Mexican project states that all
questions not involving the independence
or honor of a country are fit subjects for
arbitration, but authorizes each nation
before signing for the . ratification of a
treaty to withhold concrete question from
the convention, even though they do not
affect its honor or Independence. This is
another point favorable to Chile, and thÂ»
second point of difference from The Hague
convention.
After the proposed arbitration treaty
had been reviewed in secret session the
doors of the conference hall were again
thrown open to hear the proposal of the
Guatemala delegation for a convention
for the Pan-American court of claims.
The proposed convention provides that.
with the object of facilitating the adjust
| ment of controversies which the several
I Governments participating in the conven
! tion may have been unable to settle diplo
: matically, the high contracting parties
1 agree to submit to the court of claims all
pending and future questions between
j Governments of. any of the participating
I powers and citizens of any of the other
: powers, provided that the claimants in
, such cases shall not have served as ene
1 mies of the Government .against which
the claim is brought, or shall not have
1 voluntarily aided them.
It shall be obligatory to present such
' cases to the court for adjudication, but
! the claimant must first show that he has
exhausted all the legal resources in the
; tribunals of the country against which
: the claim Is preferred when the claim is
of a nature to be a proper subject for thÂ»
! action of this tribunal. -\

PEACE ABIDES
WITH RAILROADS
Order Is Brought Out
of the Northwestern
Tangle.
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â The Times will
say to-morrow: The main points in the
settlement of the Northwestern railroad
tangle have at last been agreed upon. This
statement was made yesterday by a mem
ber of the Harriman syndicate and also by
James J. Hill, president of the Great
Northern Railroad. Many minor details
remain unsettled, however, and It is pos
sible some of the main features may be
slightly modified. It is expected, never
theless, that the plan in its entirety will
be completed by the end of the present
week.
The principal features of tlTfe settlment
plan are tjÂ»e reorganization of the stock
holding company and the decision not to
retire the Northern Pacific preferred
stock. The latter proposition was one on
which centered the major part of the dis
cussion and it is stated that the conten
tion of the Union Pacific interests that a
permanent peace could only be obtained
by a due recognition of their rights fin
ally won.
In the new stockholding company, by
which the various stock issues are to be
funded, the former contending interests
will be equally represented. The North
ern Pacific directors will meet next week
to act on the dividend and they will prob
ably consider this question in Its relation
to the settlement. Regarding the reported
settlement the Journal of Commerce will
say to-morrow:
An authoritative admission that a general
basis of settlement of the existing differences
had been reached was announced to-day. 'The
details of the agreement were not announced,
and it is said that a statement will not be
given to the public. It is learned, however,
that the current settlement involves the or
ganization oi a. proprietary company which
shall acquire the stocks of the Northern Pa
cific and Great Northern railway companies.
The terms upon which these stocks will be
taken over were not given.
The current arrangement Involves a definite
understanding as to the control of the Bur
lington system on terms declared to be satis
factory to Union Pacific Interests. What these
terms are was not stated, but it Is learned on
reliable authority that the arrangement is one
of a definite character, which will prevent any
extension of the Burlington system to the det
riment of the Union Pacific Interests. Union
Paclllc Interests will be represented In the new
proprietary company, it is stated, both through
stock ownership and by representation on the
board of directors.
It was further more definitely established
that the St. Paul system has no direct inter
est in the current settlement. The position of
St. Paul may be benefited generally upon the
clearing up of the Northwestern situation, but
the control of the St. Paul, for the present
at least. Is not to be disturbed. One report
was that It Is eventually intended to return
the Burlington system to Its original status
of an Independent road through the medium of
the new company recently incorporated In
lowa.

CURING FAULTS
IN PENSION LAW
Attention Is Called to
Many Defects by Com
missioner Evans.
Modifies Unpleasant Rules
Relating to Paying
Money to Widows.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â ln his annual
report Commissioner of Pensions Evans
discusses at length the faults of the pres
ent system of pensioning and the difficul
ties in the way of determining the merits
of claims for pension and increases.
Attention is directed to the friction and
unkinii feeling that attends the adminis
tration of the act of August 7, 18JC, whioh
provides that the open and noto*ious acu*
of a widow pensioner snail ilperate ta
terminate her pension; but the absence of
such a law, it is stated, would encourage
sucn pensioners to dishonor tixe memory
of their soldier husbands whiie still en
joying the bounty of tiie Qovernmeru;
and, on the other hand the widow who
rtspects the law and honors society by
ltgalry entering into the marriage relation
loses her pension. For the> purpose of e-ir
rying out the provisions of this law, in
structions were issued in 18S6 to special
examiners in the Held to take deposition*
from widow claimants showing whether
they have cohabited with any man as hi*
wife since the death of the soldier. TheaÂ»
instructions were in force until Septem
ber, 1897, shortly after the Commissioner
took charge of the bureau, when he modi
fied them by directions that special ex
aminers must never question the claimant
whether she has violated the act of Au
gust 1, ISS2, unless the evidence procured
shall show that she has been living la
violation of law and then the investiga
tion must be made carefully and discreet
ly, so as not to cause unnecessary neigh
borhood gossip or scandal.
The Commissioner says that, while thÂ«
law is a most delicate and difficult on*
to administer, yet he cannot recommend
Its repeal. Attention is invited again to
ihe necessity of repealing the act of
June 7, 1888, which swept away all the
limitations as to the tiling of widows'
claims under the general law and
brought about conditions which are said
to be a standing^ invitation to file fraud
vlent claims, the arrearages being so
large and the chances of detection m>
small.
Frauds by Guardians.
In January, 1900. a rule was adopted re
quiring guardians of pensioners to ren
c.er to the bureau annual accounts of
their receipts and expenditures of pen
sion money. The rule was followed by
disclosures which, in some instances,
were of a startling nature. Guardian*
v.ere found to be drawing pensions long
sfter the death of their wards. Many
cases were found where insane pension
ers had been placed in asylums and other
public Institutions as indigent persona,
while the guardians had drawn the pen
sion during the whole period, and tither
diverted it for other purposes or alluwed
it to accumulate for the benefit of the
pensioners' legal represent tlves. Im
proper, exorbitant and extravagant Items
of expenditures were shown, which had
been authcrized and approved by the lo
cal courts. Other cases were revealed
in which the guardians were appropriat
ing the pensions to their own use, while)
the wards were being maintained at pub
lic expense. In many cases pension
moneys were shown to have accumulated
in the hands of guardians in sums rang
ing from $1000 to over $2600. while the
intended beneficiaries of the bounty of
the Government were being cared for in
public institutions at the expense of thÂ«
public.
The report presents a number of in
teresting features connected with the til
ing of claims for pensions on account of
the war with Spain and the insurrection
in the Philippines. It is shown that thÂ«
soldiers of these wars enjoy mucn
greater benefits than were accorded to
the soldiers_^of the civil war. In thÂ«
amount of pensions granted for the same
degree of disability.
While the civil war lasted for four
years and the casualties were enormous,
and the Spanish-American war lasted
only about four months, with compara
tively few casualties, it Is shown that
three years after the close of
the Spanish war claims for pen
sions amounting to about 20 per
cent of the soldiers engaged in that war
had been filed, while in 1572. or seven
years after the close of the civil war.
only about 6 per cent of the soldiers en
gaged in that war had filed claims.
Fault of the System.
The Commissioner says he la not pre
pared to believe that those who engaged 1
in the war with Spain, many of them
sons of veterans of the civil war. were
less patriotic than their ancestors, or
more covetous, but in his opinion it 13
the fault of the system of pensioning,
with its active army of attorneys, soli
citors and drummers, who are practical
ly licensed by the Government with thÂ«
promise of $25 for each claim allowed.
The report presents some interesting de
tails regarding the Njperations of these
solicitors at San Francisco when the vol
unteers returned from the Philippines for
muster out, and shows the persistency
with which these soldiers were hunted up
and persuaded to apply for pensions.
The Commissioner calls attention to the
unsatisfactory conditions attending tho
legal and medical adjudication of claim*
for pensions. Cases are usually settled on
ex-parte evidence prepared and submitted
by attorneys, whose fee is dependent upon
the allowance of the claims. The medical
examinations, which determine the rate
of pensions in valid claims, are made by
surgeons who are the neighborhood prac
titioners, whose appointment is usually a
reward for political* services and who are
subject to local Influences that bias their
judgment. As a remedy for these abuses
the Commissioner earnestly recommend*
the following method of ascertaining the
facts in pension claims: That traveling
medical examining boards be constituted,
consisting of two skilled medical examin
ers, one attorney and one stenographer
and typewriter. These boards would meet
at the county seat of each county, say,
twice a year, and the claimants would re
ceive notice in advance of their coming.
POLICEMEN MUST
NOT PLAY RACES
Commissioners Issue an
Order to the Men of
the Force.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. Nov. 6.
Under penalty of dismissal from the po
lice department, the Board of Police and
Fire Commissioners to-day ordered that
no policeman, regular or sp<
visit the Emeryville race track,, whether
on or off duty, unless upon police busi
ness.
Commissioner Johnson, in voting for the
resolution, declared that policemen were
in the habit of visiting the tracks during
the daytime, and then trying to do duty
on their beats at night. He objected to
what he asserted was the too frequent
visits of younger policemen at the races.
Further changes in the personnel of thÂ«s
police department were made to-day, fol
lowing the acceptances by the board of
the resignation of regular Patrolman
John Morrison. To succeed Morrison the
board appointed special Ignatius D. Tobln.
who has been serving as substitute for
regular Policeman Henry McCloy, retired.
In Tkbias place James H. Smith Jr. wa.i
named. Smith is a brother of Police
Judge Mortimer Smith, and has been a
conductor for nine years with the Oak
land Transtt Company.
The permanent retirement of Patrolmen
H. Nedderman and B. R. Phillips for
physical Incapacity will shortly occur. The
commissloneÂ»s to-day directed Chief , of
Police Hodgkins to prepare the oflcial
data concerning these policemen's teriua
of service-

HORE EVIDENCE TAKEN
IN RICE MURDER CASE
Detectives Testify as to Contradictory
Statements Made by Don
nelly.
The preliminary examination of William
Buckley, Thomas Moran, Charles Don
nelly and Edward Duncan, charged with
the murder of George W. Rice, a non
union machinist at Twentieth and How
ard streets, October 11. was continued be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday.
The examination xjf Detective Bailey
wat concluded. He testified to having
had an interview with Donnelly, who said
he knew nothing about the murder and
was not at Twentieth and Howard streets.
Witness brought Donnelly into the pres
ence of Buckley in the City Prison, and
Buckley said to Donnelly: "They have
got me good, and I depend upon you to
prove that I had nothing to do with the
murder." Donnelly then said he had gone
out to Twentieth and Howard streets to
collect a bill from a man named Angelus.
He was in the crowd and#aw two men
running away, but did not know who they
were.
â¢Detective T. L. Ryan was called and
testified that he had arrested Donnelly in
Moloneys saloon. Zoe'and Brannan strets.
Donnelly at first said: "Tom. I wasn't
there." but after he was confronted with
Buckley in the City Prison he said he
had lied and that he had gone out
on the car with Moran, but took no
part in the shooting. Ryan was cross
examined about a man who was taken to
identify the prisoners but had failed to
do so. He said he knew nothing of such
& circumstance and should have known
of it, as he had charge of the case. His
cross-examination was not concluded
â¢when court adjourned till this morning.

i The sale of Felts' shoes for ladies is as lively as ever. On Mon-
day and Tuesday the little store was crowded to its capacity as far as
service goes â the sixteen salesmen were as busy as bees. No sooner
was one seat vacated than another customer was right there to be
, waited on. And how the high-priced goods did go! Hundreds of
ladies bought $7. $8 and $9 shoes for $4â good, "stylish, up-to-date
footwear, too. The other values were in demand also â $4 and $5
shoes were eagerly bought for $3.50.
I The reason for the success of the sale is due to the fact that Felts
! carried only high-grade, first-class, stylish shoes, and every lady who "
â¢ appreciates fine footwear knows what the values mean when they can
i be had for half their former prices. . Come while the assortment is '
' complete. \-:i i:
By the way. there are quite a number of pairs of ladies' ' riding
boots worth $18 that are selling at another instance which shows
I that every dollar does double duty at this sale.

IBANSPOBT WARREN
AGAIN IN TROUBLE
Unfortunate Vessel Meets With, a
Serious Accident in Inland Sea
of Japan.
The depot quartermaster has received
information from Washington that the
army transport Warren has met with an
accident in the Inland Sea and will be
laid up for repairs at Kobe. That th?
vessel is injured to some considerable ex
tent is evidenced from the fact that the
Hancock has been ordered to Kobe from
Manila to take on her troops and cargo.
Further details of the accident ara
wanting, and there is a great deal of spec
ulation as to whether the Warren broke
some of her machinery, as she has done
so often, or run aground in the Inland
Sea, which is always a menace to naviga
tion on account of its treacherous chan
nel.
The Warren has had a long run of ac
cidents and has been lying idle most of
the time since she went into commission.
Harrold Knocked Insensible.
William O'Connor, a cripple who runs
the elevator at the Hall of Justice, and
Jerry Harrold, a janitor, had a dispute
yesterday morning. Harrold had been
drinking and used some offensive lan
guage toward O'Connor, who reached up
and struck Harrold under the chin, knock
ing him down. Harrold struck on the back
of his head on the floor and was taken
to the Receiving Hospital In an uncon
scious condition, where it was said he had
sustained a possible fracture of the base
of the skull. O'Connor was arrested, but
subsequently released. Both of his legs
are amputated at the knee.

Wreck of the La Gironde.
The remains of the schooner La Gironda
are evidently not worth very much. Two
weeks ago she was deemed a good risk,
but since sho got on St. Francis Islan-1
and the wreckers took possession the
chances do not seem to be so good. The
vessel left San Pedro for this port last
week and went ashore on one of the isl
ands In the Santa Barbara channel dur
ing a dense iog. Captain and crew de
serted her, and in the meantime a crew
of wreckers took possession. Twice the
owners have tried to retake the vessel .
but failed, and yesterday she was sold at
public auction lor $125. The purchaser wan
H. B. Square, but as he is a stranger on
the front the general supposition is that
he represents the wrecking crew.
The "Risdon No. 3," the Risdon Iron
Works' new launch, had her trial on the

CHEYNEY DENIES
THE MARRIAGE
Claims He Is Not United
to Woman Who Is
Suing Him.
The trial of the suit for maintenance
instituted by Maud Cheyney against Sam
uel W. Cheyney was commenced before
Judge Sloss yesterday. Cheyney, who is
a well-known mining man and a member
of the Pacific Union Club, is contesting
the suit on the ground that the woman is
not his wife.
Mrs. Cheyney, who claims to have been
married in 18S5, gave her testimony yes
terday. She said that they had been liv
ing together as husband and wife until
March, 1896, when Cheyney married her.
She further testified that Cheyney showed
her a picture of a Philadelphia church and
told her of the Quaker marriage service.
Mrs. Cheyney, who was Maud Nevlll at
that time, claims that they were married
that day according to the Quaker rites,
which consisted of the uttering by each
of an agreement to love and cherish each
other and kneeling for a time In silent
prayer.
In support of her claim Mrs. Cheyney
introduced a letter purporting to have
been written by Cheyney to a Miss Poun
ing in which he asked the young lady to
"look out for his little wifey."
Cheyney's attorneys will try to prove
that he word "wifey " was written by an
other person, and though no direct charge
ot" forgery was made it was intimated
that a change had been made in the
wording of the letter to further the in
terests of Mrs. Cheyney.
Mrs. Cheyney occupied the witness
stand the entire day. Most of the time
was taken up in reading letters written
by her to Cheyney. These epistles showed
that she was very fond of the defend
ant. She styled him "My dear boy" in
every missive and always closed by pray
ing God to bless him and signing herself
"lovingly yours."
Several times during the examination
Mrs. Cheyney broke into tears and Chey
ney showed by his demeanor that he felt
ashamed of the position in which the cor
respondence placed him.
In the letters written by Mrs. Cheyney
she frequently referred to a desire to suf
fer anything rather than cause him
trouble and in one she wrote: "I believe in
the forgiving, loving, pitying God, who
will see that my burden is too heavy for
me and will give me rest."
Many of the letters were written from
Los Gatos, where the plaintiff spent a
great deal of time, and were addressed to
Cheyney to several towns in California
and Arizona. Most of these missives were
written apparently in answer to let
ters sent to her by Cheyney, in which he
had evidently reproached her for show
ing her regard for .him. In one of the let
ters she wrote: "I am satisfied that a
few months more of your teaching shall
make me a perfect model of coldness."
The case was continued until next week.
Water-Front Notes.
The schooner W. F. Jewett nearly went
on the beach yesterday morning. The
tide carried her in toward Lime Point,
but the big Sea Queen came along and
towed her to safety.
George P. Taylor of the Pacific Steam
Whaling Company is home from Nome.
He says that "half has not been told" of
the richness of the new gold diggings.
There was trouble on the transport
Grant yesterday. The men were given
two hours in which to vote, but failed to
show up when their time expired. The
result was that all of them were dis
charged for failing to report for duty. The
men say they have a grievance. The mate
says "discipline is discipline and I'll run
my ship, election or no election.''
