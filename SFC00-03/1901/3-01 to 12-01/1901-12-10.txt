SENATOR FRYE INTRODUCES A MEASURE
TO AID THE AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE
FLIGHT OF CASHIER REVEALS
HEAVY SHORTAGE IN FUNDS OF
WHICH HE WAS THE CUSTODIAN
Henry J. Fleishman Steals One Hundred Thousand Dollars From the
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of Los Angeles and Escapes
Across the Mexican Line Before the Defalcation Is Discovered
LOS 'A?CGTEX.ESr i>ec.9;â Henry Z\
Fleishman, for many'years'cash
ier of the Farmers' and Mer
chants' Bank of- this .city, has
disappeared and with him went a
sum of the bank's funds, believed to ap
proximate at least $100,000. The shortage
was first discovered this morning, shortly
after the usual hour for beginning the
day's business. Fleishman did not ap
pear at his desk, and this, coupled with
the fact that he had pleaded illness on
Saturday and remained away from busi
ness, aroused the suspicion of H. W. Hell
xnan, vice president of the institution. An
Investigation was immediately begun, with
the result that a shortage in the bank's
currency account was soon discovered.
H. W. Hellman notified his brother I.
W. Hellman of San Francisco, president
of the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank,
â who sent out a description of the miss
ing cashier with a request to the police
officials of the country to apprehend him.
Fleishman was last seen in Los Angeles
about 9 o'clock Saturday morning. ..At
that hour he sent word from the Cali-J
fornia Club, where he had bachelor apart-]
xnents, to the bank, saying that because
of illness he would not be down. ( Noth
ing was thought of the incident at the
bank and business went on as usual on
Saturday. When he failed to -appear at
the usual time to-day, however, the in
vestigation of the bank's cash account
quickly uncovered the shortage.
Employers Are Duxnf ounded.
The officials of the Farmers' and Mer
chants' Bank were as much surprised at
the action of their cashier as was the
general public. For twenty-five years
Fleishman had been employed in the in
stitution, beginning at the bottom as a
boy and by strict attention to duty, cou
pled with a thorough understanding of
the intricacies of the banking business,
rising to the position of assistant cashier
and finally to that of cashier, a position
ho has held for many years. The utmost
confidence was always placed in his Judg
ment and integrity. He was not known
to be addicted to drink or speculation,
though he was an ardent patron of all
kinds of sports. His real estate holdings
in Los Angeles are estimated at $50,000.
This property, besides a bond of $30,000
in a surety company, will, in the Judg
ment of the bank officials, compensate the
institution for the cash taken. V'iLv
H. W. Hellman, vice president of the
Farmers' and Merchants: Bank, said, in
speaking of Fleishman's absence:
"We were greatly surprised in discov
ering Fleishman's flight and the shortage
in his cash account. We are utterly un
able to account for his action. He is a
man of property and has always com
manded a good salary. If he were en
gaged in speculation of any kind we did
not know it; nor was he a drinking manâ
at least to any extent. No doubt he took
a drink when he wanted it, bÂ»t drink
never could have caused him to, do this.
We can account for his disappearance
only on the supposition that there is a
woman In the case. We are not worrying
over the money he has taken, however.
The bank holds a bond and other col
lateral sufficient to indemnify it for the
cash stolen. It will not lose a dollar. The
loss of the cash will not embarrass us in"
the least."
Hit by the Slump in Copper.
There is a rumor, apparently well
founded, that Fleishman has been specu-

lating in Amalgamated Copper and was
hard bit by the '' recent slump in that'
stock. John. S. Vallely, assistant secre
tary and manager of "the California Club,'
.where Fleishman had. apartments,- said: j
"The officials of the bank telephoned to
the club Saturday 1 morning and asked, 1
'How is Mr. Fleishman - this morning?'- I
went to his- room -and found It unoccu
pied. I telephoned' this fact to Mr. Hell
man immediately. From -this time. : on
there was a constant call for Fleishman.
Messengers came to the club during all
hours Saturday and Sunday. I ; suspected
Fleishman was a heavy loser in 'the re
cent; fall in copper stocks."
. Fleishman married _ Miss _ Virginia Har-r
rell, whose father then resided in VIsalia,
eleven years ago. The union proved an
unhappy one and after a few years Mrs.
Fleishman " sued for ' divorce, alleging
j brutality and other charges, which at the
time caused a mild sensation in social
and business circles. During all his
troubles, however, the bank stood by him
loyally. After his wife obtained a di
vorce-Fleishman took up his abode at
the California Club, where he has since
lived. >:,"
While it is believed by some of Fleish
man's former associates and friends that
there is a woman in the case, up to the
present no one has been found who can
give any information on that point. It is
not believed by the police that he weni
northward, but those acquainted with
him are of the opinion that he went south
and that hs was safe oh Mexican soil be
fore the disclosure of his flight and defal
cation.
Of late there have been rumors that
the cashier was showing marked atten
tion to a vaudeville star who has recently
been touring this coast.-
Engages in Losing Ventures.
Fleishman was the financial backer of
several enterprises in Los Angeles which
were , commonly considered as financial
failures. The Velodrome bicycle (track
was financed by Fleishman and in this
venture he is believed to have sunk $20,
000.' The Maxwell patent directory was
another scheme in which the defaulter
was interested and in' which he is said
to have lost $25,000. These things may. in
some measure, account for the shortage
in the bank's cash, which, it is not un
likely, has existed for some time. ?'"â 
Not the slightest clew, to Fleishman's
whereabouts has been obtained. The pos
sibility of suicide has been suggested, but
those who know him "best scout this 'idea.
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1901.
.^The'^njatter of the cashier's disappear
ance was not laid before the criminal au
thorities, until' late to-day." Chief. Elton
held: a consultation in his office later with
Sheriff Hammel and the captain of de
tectives. Whatever they decided upon
doing was not given out for publication.
It has not been settled to a certainty;
when "Fleishman was last seen in Los'An
geles. Some claim that he left here on
Saturday morning; yet others declare they
saw. him- as- late as 3:30 o'clock on the
same afternoon. A theory has been ad
vanced that Fleishman departed on the
overland limited, but as a matter of fact
no one has been found yet who knows
positively how the missing cashier made'
his exit. Before the bank people inform
ed, the local police ' department that their
cashier had absconded they had taken
the precaution to send the . news to San
Francisco, and to several detective agen
cies in the East.
NOT SEEN IN SAN DIEGO.
Fleishman Probably Took the Land
Route to Mexico.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 9.-Word has been
j-eceived by the police of this city that
, the Los Angeles authorities are Inclined
to the belief that fugitive Fleishman had
.passed through this city on his way to
Ensenada. . It is a belief in which local
officers have no part, -because Fleishman
is known. here, and, furthermore, once in
Lower California, the avenues to civil
ization are so few that they can be
easily watched. No trace of him has
been found here and inquiry at the Mex
ican line fails to show that any person
of Fleishman's description has passed
that way. The number of people at the
line who could be reached to-night was
limited and all communicVtion with En
senada is shut off at night.
TETJSTED FOB TWENTY YEARS.
Banker Hellman Tells of the Ingrat
itude of Fleishman.
Captain Seymour was notified yesterday
by E. S. Heller, attorney for the Nevada
bank, of Cashier Fleishman's flight - with
$100,000 in currency or more belonging to
the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of Los
Angeles. The following description of
Fleishman was given: Weight, 160 pounds;
height, five feet eight and a half, or nine
inches; dark complexion, hair thin on top
of head/ good teeth, dark brown mus
tache, prominent ears, straight nose,
pleasant address, a stylish dresser and
fond of the society of women. He is a
member of. the Mystic Shriners and may
wear a button of the order.
Captain -Seymour at once telegraphed,
to all points, east, west, north and south,
a full, description of Fleishman and in
structions to arrest him. It' is not be
lieved that he came, in this direction, it
being regarded as more probable that he
departed for Mexico or the East by the
train leaving Los Angeles on Saturday
morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock. â '-.:'
I. W. Hellman of the Nevada National
Bank said regarding the cashier's flight:
"li is a sad affairâ not from a monetary
standpoint, which, I am glad, to say
through The Call, is of small importance.
The money loss, whatever it is, . I can
easily, stand. It is the ingratitude 1 that is
the sad feature: . Fleishman has been in
my employ'more than twenty years, and
worked himself up from office boy to the

With these words S. F. Leib, president
of the board . of trustees of the Leland
Stanford Junior University, received yes
terday from Mrs. Jane L. Stanford docu
ments conveying to the university. $30,000,
000 worth of property, thereby making it
one of the richest seats of learning in the
United States, and adding another stone
to the arch of fame which for years has
been in course of erection in. honor of the
young man after whom the great uni
versity was named. '
' There were but few present ' when < th<Â»
transaction took place, but the scene will
live long in the memory of the witnesses.
The " wishes of her dead . husband . ! have
guided Mrs. Stanford in her - every â¢ act
since his death, and she knows that it was
his aim to make the great â¢ institution,
which he founded during his life and to
which he gave the 'name of his only son,
a monument which would stand , forever.
She has carried out his wishes to the very
letter and seeks no reward: for her noble
effortihother than the knowledge that she
has done as her husband .would have done
had he .lived, and . that the people of Cali
fornia, in fact, the world, are, benefit
claries. â 
- Every Gift Is Legalized.
The documents turned over to President
Leib "yesterday ; have legalized â¢ every gift
or.bequestmade to the university by Mrs.
Stanford. 1 \ They consist of . two deeds f of
grant and; one deed of gift. ;. One. of â¢; the

not included In former grants.
â  The â  second deed i of grant ' is a convey
ance of ; the magnificent Stanford resi
dence, at> the corner of Powell and Cali

University. It has long been the aim of
Mrs. Stanford to place within the reach
of. the people of San Francisco the bene
fits of Stanford University. In order to
do' so she has given up her magnificent
home. In the document conveying this
piece .'of property to the university she
stipulates that it shall be used for educa

She retains a life interest In the Stanford
home, and upon her death it is to be made
Into an institution of learning. It is to be
a department of the university.' As near
as can be learned Mrs. Stanford intends
that her beautiful home shall be a place
where the faculty of Stanford shall deliv

AH doubts concerning the provisions of

The following is an extract from the
deed of grant conveying the Stanford
residence on California street to the trus

Now, therefore, pursuant to the express au

This is the largest gift ever made by
any one person to any cause. The great

Special Dispatch to The CalL
PORT TOWN'SEND, Dec. 9.â The long
overdue schooner Ralph J. Long, forty
seven days from Nome, with ninety pas
sengers and fifteen stowaways, arrived
to-day. According to the passengers, the
Long had an eventful voyage and they
narrowly escaped both starvation and
death by drowning. When the Long
sailed from Nome she difl not have more
than enough provisions and water to last
her to Dutch Harbor on a fast trip, but
before that port was reached the water
supply had given out. George Morrlll.
the managing owner, and several sailors
volunteered to go ashore In a small boat
to procure water. While they were on
itae way the steamer Arctic came along
and Morrill boarded her. leaving $135
with the boat's crew for the purchase of
water and supplies. When the Long's
passengers and crew were half famished
a favorable wind carried them to Dutch
Harbor, where the boat's crew was
picked up, and it was found that the $135
would purchase but a small portion of the
necessary supplies. A collection of $47U
was raised among the passengers.
Charles D. Lane's gasoline schooner ar
rived, and when the condition of â¢ the
Long's passengers was learned Lane gave
$5o and the crew subscribed $107. This
money was expended, but was not enough
to pay for a sufficiency of supplies. How
over, the Alaska Commercial Company
furnished everything necessary and Cap
tain Green gave the company a bottomry
bond on the schooner.
The Loiie left Dutch Harbor on No
vember 9 ai;U encountered heavy head
winds. On November 11 a storm came up
and the little craft was tossed about at
the mercy of the gale and on several
occasions thrown almost on her beam
ends. Seas continually swept her decks,
carrying away one lifeboat and nearly all
of her water supply. While Mate Han
son was trying to save the watter barrels
he was carried overboard and drowned.
The passengers had to depend on what
rsln water could be caught on the deck
ol the vessel. They are highly indignant
at the action of the owner of the Long In
deserting them.

W.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â Crazy
Snake, who was once a leader of some
prominence among the Creek Indians,
made an unsuccessful attempt to hold a
council with Great Father Roosevelt at
the White House to-day. He appeared in
the corridors, accompanied by four other
members of his tribe and an interpreter,
and announced that he would like to see
President Roosevelt. H<2 was told that he
could only do so when in the company of
the Indian Commissioner or some official
from his office. Commissioner Jones re
fused to frank the Indians Into the White
House, and they went away unheard.- .
Crazy Snake, whose store name is Wil

Crazy Snake wishes to keep the white

SENATOB HOAR AFTER
ANARCHISTS AND LYNCHEES
Introduces a Resolution Requesting
, the President to Negotiate With
Other Governments. . .
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â Senator
Hoar gave proof In black and white to-day
that he was in earnest when he proposed
to deport anarchists to an island.
He presented in the Senate a resolution
requesting the President to enter Into
negotiations with- other civilized Govern
ments to the end that some island or other
suitable territory be set apart by joint
action on which, under due precaution
and after fair trial, persons found guilty
of attempting. Instigating or counseling
the overthrow of government, or of crim
inal attempts on chief magistrates or
other high officials, may be confined.
Thus Is the venerable Massachusetts
Senator ready for anarchy and a renewal
of attempts to get international action on
the matter.
Senator Hoar also introduced a bill de
signed to severely punish participants In
lynchings. It provides for the trial of all
lynchers by United States District Courts
and imposes Imprisonment and a heavy
money penalty on conviction. The fine Is
to paid to the family of the victim of the
lynchers, or, in case there is no family to
the treasury of the county where the
lynching occurs. It also provides that all
officers charged with the protection of
prisoners who fall in their duty shall be
fined to the extent of $5000.

The members of the union arrived late,
after playing at the various theaters and
other places of amusement, and not until
nearly midnight did the parlors fill up
with the musicians.
The Mayor-elect arrived shortly before
midnight, alone and attired in a plain
black suit and the men who had not had
opportunity after their evening's work to
change to evening dress felt at once in
closer sympathy with the lately elected
chief executive of the municipality.
As members and ' guests arrived
they grouped in the parlors and
conversed, until, at 12:20, they were led
into the main hall and from there
marched In line to the banquet hall, led
by C. P. Abiatti and the Mayor-elect. -
The Columbia Theater Orchestra, sta
tioned on a platform across the east end
of the hall, played while the banqueters
were being seated the "American Citizen
March," composed by the guest of honor,
the Mayor-elect.
The banauet hall was decorated with
greenery and national flags. Ten tables
gave accommodation to some 300 mem

east end of the hall stretched the long

the bank for $30,000 by one of the bonding
insurance companies. Besides the bond
for $30,000 Fleishman has considerable
property in his own name In Los Angeles
which will reduce the bank's loss consid
erably,
"I would like to say through The Call
that our paid up capital is $500,000 and the
surplus, after the loss has been niet, will
still be more than $900,000. The moment
I learned by telegraph of the defalcation
I informed and called Into service the
police department of this city, and also
nought the aid of Pinkerton's detectives,
so by this hour there Is not a police de
partment in the United States, Mexico
and Canada but has a perfect description
of the man. Let me e$.y that the bank
is still one of the strongest financial in
stitutions of the country and I would de
clare, firmly and absolutely that we will
not be affected in the slightest way by
the defalcation. Indeed, the loss itself
is not a serious one to us. but I must ad
mit my intense disappointment in the
man in whom I for so many years placed
implicit confidence. Neither depositors
nor any one connected with the j bank
need have anv fear."
When asked whether Fleishman was ex
travagant in his mode of living Mr. Hell
man declared that he was quiet in his
habits, never gambled and did not drink.
The banker said that Fleishman married
a very estimable lady. Miss Harroll of
VIsalla, but they were divorced - several
years ago. There was one child. '
Mr. Hellman left for Los Angeles last
night to prosecute the- fullest inquiries.
He declares that everything that Is possi

the bar of justice.

Mayor-Elect's Response.
'The Mayor-elect spoke as follows:
K My Dear Friends and Brothers:' This is the
first formal reception which I have accepted
since the people by their votes confirmed the
good opinion which you. yourselves, have so
often expressed, in electing me to official posi
tions in this union, by promoting me from your
presidency to the chief magistracy of the city.
And it is especially fitting that you, from
whom I come, and whose representative I am
and always hope to be, should be the first to
whom should be extended the glad hand of
acknowledgment and of grateful appreciation.
I regard this as a personal compliment great
er even than my election, for in the election
there was victory for principle as well as for
the indiviflualâ the principle of equal represen
tation of all elements of the peopleâ while I
take this as wholly a personal tribute from
you, my devoted colleagues and well wishers,
to your brother and ycur friend.
1 appreciate to the fullest extent your kind
ness and the impulsive sentiment which
prompted .this great gathering of the men of
music and their friends. It is the harmony of
hearts and the concord of the soul.
The soul of the musician is so enwrapt with
warm and kindly feeling, his mind so occupied
with the harmonies of the universe of nature
and those which underlie the noblest acts of
man, that practical raen of affairs look with
doubt upon, the possibility of the head remain
ing cool while' the heart still retains â¢ its
warmth, its sentiment, its love. I, who know
you, am most happy Indeed that to me shall
be given the opportunity of proving practi
cally that with all, his artistic sentiments, with

FAILS TO RALLY
Health of the Late Presi
dent's Widow Fast
Failing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Dec' 9.â The visit of Mr.
and Mrs. Charles G. Dawes to Mrs. Mc-
Kinley at her home in Canton is believed
here to be significant. Reports from Can
ton, while exceedingly guarded, are to the
effect that the condition of Mrs. McKln
ley is regarded with great anxiety by her
family and close friends.
It is generally understood that Mrs. ; Mc-
Klnley never fully recovered from the ef
fect of her experiences on the California
trip and her illness In San ' Francisco.
Then came the shock of her husbands
tragic end. It has developed that the
heart-breaking strain made serious in
roads on her physical and mental
strength. . In fact,. It is regretfully ad
mitted by those near to Mrs. McKinley
that both mind and body, have been seri
ously undermined and there are signs that
seem to indicate she is failing rapidly.
One of the unfavorable symptoms of
Mrs. McKinley's case is her mental condi
tion. She mourns .constantly for her hus
band, and can .think or talk of no other
subject. The holiday season 5 always has
been a time for gayety with Mrs. McKIn
ley, but it is, understood that she feels
the bereavement so poignantly that she
has told relatives she has . no heart to
participate In any Christmas festivities.
Another fact shows how keenly Mrs.
McKinley feels her bereavement. and how
constantly it occupies her mind. : It has
repeatedly happened since the funeral '
that on pleasant days -she has had a
rocking-chair taken' to her husband's
tomb. There; accompanied by her nurse
or a friend, she has sat for hours beside
the tomb, plunged In grief and a prey to
deepest melancholy. '
In the last two weeks this tendency to.
melancholy has grown more marked, and)
Mrs. McKinley's condition has . become . a'
source of anxiety, to her friends in Canton
and to those who have gone to ' see her
from other parts of the ' State. So keen
has the anxiety become that a systematic
effort will now be 'made to -interest, her
in things about' her. and take her mind
away from , the one subject that , absorbs
her thoughts in all her waking hours: :
Reports from Canton go so far as to in
dicate-that unless there is an improve
ment In Mrs. McKinley's condition there
is : a grave ; fear that she will not I've

recognize two cardinal principles In
the performance of all my pnbllo
duties, on which I know your
thoughts -will agree with mine. â  â¢
, First Â» That all classes of our
community 'have equal rights and
are entitled to equal privileges un
der the law, and that none are enti
tled to special privileges.
. Second) That there is no Inherent
and irreconcilable difference be
tween employer and employe, capi
tal and labor, rich and poor; that
their Interests should be Identical
and that all differences between
them can and should be adjustetl.
I believe that capital should have
steady and safe investment in order
that labor may have permanent and
remunerative employment.
Our interests all lie that -way. All
of us are equally conservative. We
want no commercial panics. We
want no soup houses, if avoidable.
We want no strikes.
Municipal Ideals.
We do want a city where the people are hap
py and prosperous; where the wage-earner and
his family live in contentment and peace;
where social conditions are such that the man
who employs labor will ask and receive no
more than he is willing to accord to his em
ploye, and where the wage-worker will give
th.e same, fair and. Just consideration to the
man who pays his wages as he is willing to
ask and take for himself; where capital and
labor will walk hand in hand for the better
ment and advancement of, this, now the great
est city of the Pacific Coast, eventually to be
come,, perhaps, the greatest, in the United
It may not be possible to realize this Ideal,
all at once, but whatever power Is given to me
will be exerted in this direction.
I feel strongly the responsibility and obliga
tion that are now upon me. I will do my best
as a man and an American to do my duty
honestly and fairly.
It is no path of roses â except, perhaps, for
the thorns, but I shall do my best to tread it
firmly and uprightly, to meet all problems as
they arise with a view single to the good of
the whole people, to the Justification of your

sides that the movement, for subsidized
Americans has gained'materially, and the
chances for the Frye bill are now re
garded a little -better ; than ever.
Senator Hanna has his whole heart in
the fight, and with two such strong lead
ers in support working night and day
with renewed hope and courage it is said
the bill can command almost all the Re
publican strength in the Senate.
The features of the bill changing tha
rates of mail subsidies corresponding with
the new classification of ships are looked
on as giving great strength. The present
ratesâ $4, $2, $1 and 67 centsâ fixed by the
House in the law of 1891 have been found
to be too low for the faster mall steam
ers and too nigh for the slower after an
experience of ten years. The bill passed
by the Senate that year fixed the rates at
$6, $3, $150 and $1. The -Frye bill restores
the old Senate rates of $6 to twenty-knot
steamers, increasing, from 8000 to 10,000
tons minimum size, and restores the rate
of $3 for . sixteen-knot steamers, provided
the size is increased from 5000 tons, the
present â  minimum, to 8000 tons, the mod
ern - British . and German mail size. J . The
bill leaves at present the rates or re
duces the mail pay for slower and smaller
steamers, lit drops j altogether the -obso
lete wooden steamers of only twelve
knots as no longer eligible from the ocean
mail service.' The rates fixed by the bill
are maximum I rates. Mail contracts are
open to competition and will be awarded
at rates as far below maximum as will
secure an American mail service.
A general uniform subsidy. of one cent
per gross ton for every one hundred miles
sailed is another feature that is com
manding favorable -comment. This amount
is sufficient, according to the latest fig
ures; to equalize the difference in Ameri
can-seamen's wages and in. the cost of
building ocean: steainers, in the United
States and Great Britain referred to in
President Roosevelt's message and' Sec
retary Gage's report. To promote the
building of new ocean vessels an addi
tional allowance of one-fourth of a' cent
per gross ton is. made for five years. The
bill provides that a - vessel' shall receive
only one form of subsidy. â¢"â â¢ â¢

GRASS VALLEY, Dec. 9.â All Nevada
County is wondering why Charles Allen,
suspected of complicity In the doing
away with Joseph Griffiths, Is not under
arrest. Yesterday a 44-caliber bullet WJ.
found In the body of the murdered maiTJ
To-day it was learned that Allen has a
rifle of" that caliber. Griffiths was la^t
seen alive in the Allen home. Months
after his disappearance his body wju
found at the bottom of an abandoned
mine shaft at the rear -of Allen'a house.
"While the inquest has been In progress
here . the suspect has paced up and down
in front of. the dingy courtroom, making
no attempt to hide his extreme nervous
ness and seemingly not meditating any
attempt at escape.
The Coroner's lnauest ended In a ver
dict that means nothing, except that Jo
seph Griffiths was murdered. The jury
reported simply that the deceased came
to his death from an unknown cause and
at the hands of a person or'persons un
known. To-morrow the Grand Jury will
take up the case, and following Its de
liberations there are likely to be several
arrests.
Sheriff Getchell went Into the country
to-day and found Dirgle Toolie, the In
dian implicated In the tragedy, and
brought him to town. An Immense crowd
surrounded the party as It returned, as
many believe the Indian to be the'mur
derer. When the' inquest was resumed
this afternoon the streets were packed
with people who could not gain an en
trance. Word of the proceedings was
passed along, and every sentence was
eagerly caugnt up and communicated tu
others. â¢?. r- >-
Mrs. Jennie Kelener was an Important
witness. She said that Mrs. Benfleld told;
her some time ago that if she (Mrs. Ben-f^"
field) were a man she would find Grlf-T
nths' body . in two hours. Mrs. Benfieid
contradicted this, and for a time It was
feared there would be trouble In the
courtroom.
William Benfleld, from whom the in
formation leading to the finding of the
body first came, took the stand again to
day. He said that he was intoxicated
when he testified on Saturday evening,
and that he had committed perjury in
answer to every- Question. His -testimony
to-day was a flat contradiction of his evi
dence of Saturday night.
When Dirgie Toolie,' the Digger Indian*
walked Into the courtroom, escorted by
Sheriff Getchell, all eves were turned
upon him. On the stand he displayed con
siderable Intelligence. He said he was
at the Anthony House, several milÂ«s away,
when the murder was committed. When
asked point blank if he had murdered
Griffiths he vehemently replied that he
had not. Annie Texas, the Indian's wife,
was called to the stand, but she could
give no important information.
John Hocking, through whose efforts
Griffiths* body was found at the bottom
of the mining shaft, told a straightfor
ward story of how he had come t>y his
information. During a conversation with
Mrs. Keleher the latter had said that Mrs.
Benfieid had told her she knew where
the body was. Hocking was Informed
that Mrs. Benfieid had said that "at 5

Dredger Brings Up Gold
in Folsom Mining
District.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 9.â Donald Cam
eron, manager of the Ashburton Mining
Company, the stock of which is owned
exclusively by Eastern capitalists, report
ed this afternoon that yesterday's clean
up of the dredger working near Folsom
netted $6000 in gold dust. Cameron said
this figure represented the average
weekly earnings for some time past. He
added that two more dredgers were
being built by other companies near the
one he is operating.
Cameron said he visited the Blue Wing
mine, near Folsom. recently, and while
he was there a panful of earth was taken
out which when washed yieldel $200 gold
dust He is confident that the Folsom
country is rich in gold.
These for the most part are diggings
abandoned by miners in the sixties as
"worked out," but it appears modern
methods bring forth the mineral which
the early miners were unable to get
through their primitive appliances.

CARNEGIE'S GIFT
TO GOVERNMENT
Ten Millions to Establish
University for Higher
Education.
Donor to Furnish All Money-
Needed, Not One Cent Being
Asked From Uncle Sam.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â The Post to
morrow will .eay: President Roosevelt
has received a letter from Andrew Car
negie, in which the latter offers to make
a donation of $10,000,000 , to the j United
States. The letter will be referred to
Congress by the President in a special
message. \
Carnegie's gift is for the purpose of es
tablishing In Washington a university for
higher education. "As far as his idea has
been developed it proposes a gift after
the manner of the bequest of James
Smithson, the Englishman who gave
$1,000,000 for the establishment and main
tenance of what Is now known as the
Smithsonian Institution. Smithson de
sired the institution founded by him to be
a factor in "the diffusion of scientillc
knowledge.','
Carnegie 'proposes that the university
which he is to endow shall be the great
est institution in the world for the devel
opment of higher education. He has
consulted President Gilman of Johns Hop
kins University, President Hadley of
Yale, President Eliot of Harvard, ex-
President White of Cornell and all the
leading educators of the country. They
heartily indorse his plan.
The proposed university will not Inter
fere in the least with the educational in
stitutions already established, but will
supplant them, for, according to the
present plan, its doors will be open' only
to those who desire to take up a post
graduate course.
Carnegie also wants the new university
to take the lead in original research, so
that the United States can eventually
stand side by side with Germany, if not
excel that nation in scientific develop
ment.
Carnegie's plan does not propose a na
tional university In the sense that an ap
propriation will be asked or needed. The
Government is simply to be the trustee
of the magnificent endowment, just as it
administers the fund bequeathed by
Smithson. It is probable that a board of
regents will be appointed, as in the case
of the Smithsonian Institution, or it may
be that the Government will be represent
ed on the board of directors, which, it
Is contemplated, shall consist of men of
national reputation. , :
Carnegie has kept the proposed endow
ment a secret until he could definitely ar
range the plan and scope of the new uni
versity. Even yet all these details have
not been arranged, so that little more
than the outline of his gift can be pub
lished.
It is known, however, that he does not
pronose to ask from Congress a single
foot of land upon which the university
building will be constructed. The entire
expense Is to be borne out of his en
dowment. No site has yet been selected.
It will, however, - necessarily be very
large, as it is proposed to erect a series
of magnificent structures.
The amount of money to be given by
Carnegie equals the sum of the present
endowment fund of Harvard, and is con
siderably more than the invested fund of
Yale.

Information received from Salonica, Miss

was brought by a Macedonian who left

by an uncle, Charles Brenlg, who went
to Hawaii in 1860 under the name of Sim-.

HIGHLY DRAMATIC SCENE
IN THE SENATE CHAHBER
Senator Tillman of South Carolina Challenges His Colleague,
Senator McLaurin, to Resign With Him After a Brief but
Bitter Controversy Concerning Their Respective Policies
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â The
Senate chamber was the
scene of a highly dramatic
episode to-day when Senator
Tillman of South Carolina
challenged his colleague, Senator Mc-
Laurin, to resign with him on the spot.
In order, to use his own language, that
they might be able to "wash their dirty
linen at home." McLaurin did not take
up the gage. The Incident to-day was
the -direct result of the very bitter con
troversy which arose between the Senators
in South Carolina last spring. McLaurin
arose to a question of personal privilege
to-day and proceeded to explain what he
charged was a conspiracy to discredit him
in his own State for facts and views
which did not meet the approval of cer
tain Democratic leaders. -
A stir in the chamber followed when
McLaurin of South Carolina arose to a
question of personal privilege. He had
before him a huge pile of manuscript.
McLaurin Shows Much Emotion.
"I arise to a question of personal priv
ilege in connection with the publication
of the statement that I have been ex
cluded from participation in the Demo
cratic party caucus," he announced. Witn
evidence of considerable emotion he pro
ceeded to explain that if such was the
case and if he were to be without assign
ment upon committees the rights of nis
State, which he in part represented in the
Senate, would suffer. The only notice he
had ever had, he said, that he was to be
excluded from the Democratic caucus
came last spring before the adjournment
of the Senate, when the chairman of the
Democratic National Committee asked
him why he no longer attended the Dem
ocratic caucuses. He had replied that in
view of his opinion of the questions grow
ing out of tne Spanish war he thought
his presence might.be embarrassing. Ihe
Democratic chairman had replied:
"Then perhaps it would be less embar
rassing to you not to.be invited to the
caucuses?" _ . .
McLaurin said he had replied: "Certain
ly " -
This incident, McLaurin declared, was
the culmination of a long series of events
in a contest waged by an element pi the
Democratic party against him. .
Continuing, McLaurin said he could be
silent did he not fear that the movement
against him was one to keep alive section
alism. For many years the people of the
South had realized that they had not ob
tained their fair share of the national
benefits. McLaurin recalled the fact that
although Samuel J. Randall had ad
vocated a protective tariff he had been
voted for in a Democratic national con
vention for President. Hancock, although
he declared the tariff was a local issue,
had been nominated for President, and
David B. Hill, although he opposed the in
come tax. had not been read out of the
Democratic party. :.\ , .. '.; .'.
Explains Several of His Votes.
The holding of such views by Northern
men, no matter how diverse, did not en
danger the position of certain political
leaders, and consequently they were im
mune from attack. But when a Southern
man, said McLaurin, tried to get the ben
efit of the tariff for his people, those
whose political career might be ended by
the success of his efforts were ready to
crush and humiliate him.
Now the principal charge against him
was that during the McKinley adminis
tration he had "been bought by patron
age," and that he had renewed his for
mer contract with President Roosevelt.
Entertaining the high personal regard
that he did for both the late President
and his successor, McLaurin said it would
be unnecessary for him to say that neith
er would stoop ;to- so ignoble an act. He
had voted for the war with Spain, and
declared that in the same spirit in which
ho had cast that vote he felt that he was
compelled to support the administration
that conducted it. He still thought that
the conduct of the war should have been
non-partisan, and during its progress he
had never heard from President McKln-
Iey's lips a word concerning party advan
tage.
While without official knowledge of the
charges brought against him -by his
Democratic colleagues, from the newspa
pers he "understood that the principal
charges were that he. had not opposed
the ratification of the treaty of peace
with Spain: that he had upheld the ad
ministration in its efforts to restore or
der in the Philippines, and to that end
had voted for an increase in the stand
ing army, and that he was in favor of
the upbuilding of the American merchant
marine.
Excoriated New Democratic Leaders.
"If these are the only charges," said
he, dramatically, "they are true, and I
glory in them.
"But," he declared, "the dictates of rea
son and conscience should not be stifled
by the party lash."
With bitter words, McLaurin then pro
ceeded to excoriate the new leaders of
the Democratic party, who had, he said,
guided the party to its destruction during
the last few years and were trying to
crucify those who would seek to draw
the Democratic party back to its old al
legiance.
"When McLaurin took his seat, Jones of
Arkansas took the floor. Some of the
statements made by McLaurin Jones con
sidered a reflection upon himself, and said
he desired to offer a statement concern
ing the incident to which McLaurin had
referred. At the extra session of the
Senate last spring he had been asked by
the caucus officer tor the list of Senators
vho were to be summoned to a caucus,
and McLaurin's name being mentioned,
he (Jones) had said that he himself would
see the Senator from South Carolina,
"I met him In the cloakroom," said
Jones, "and, recalling the fact that hs
had not attended a Democratic caucus
for more than two years, I asked him
what his status was. He replied that his
relations with the party were such that
he thought it would be embarrassing for
him to enter the Democratic caucus. I
then said to him, 'You do not wish to be
invited, then?' and he replied, 'Certainly.'
As to the charge of ulterior motive on
my part," continued Senator Jones, "I
am content to treat it with the contempt
it deserves."
Tillman of South Carolina was on his
feet when Jones concluded. In his char
acteristic way he answered that while
his name had not been mentioned, he wa3
the cause of it all. He would not at this
time make an extended reply. Briefly he
reviewed the controversy between himself
and Senator McLaurin which led to the
joint tender of their resignations to the
Governor of South Carolina last spring,
and told of the Governor's suggestion
that the resignations be withdrawn.
Tillman said he contended that the Gov
ernor was simply "a box into which he
had put letters for the Legislature." and
that they could not undo the act, but Mc-
Laurin had hastened f.o withdraw his let
ter. Tillman said he had examined the
record, and that of about 200 cases in the
history of the Government where Sen
ators had resigned McLaurin enjoyed the
distinction of being the only one who had
withdrawn his resignation after offering
it.
McLaurin made no reply to Tillman, but
in replying to Senator Jones said that he
did not desire that there should be any
thing Dersonal in his charge that there
had been an "ulterior purpose" in any
thing he had done.
Hoar of 'Massachusetts addressed him
self to the legality of the resignations
which the South Carolina ' Senators had
sent to the Governor of their State. He
declared that the resignation of a legis
lative officer vacated the office at once,
and that he doubted whether such resig
nations could be withdrawn. In his opin
ion neither of the South Carolina Sen
ators had a right to address the Senate
if the statements made by Tillman were
correct.
Tillman said he had been of the same
opinion himself, and he suggested that
the Judiciary Committee' look into the
matter, as he should enjoy .nothing so
much as washing the. "dirty linen" at
home.
Tillman Again Proposes to Resign.
Jumping to his feet McLaurin declared In
ringing tones that he was ready to meet
his colleague at any place or at any time
for the discussion of the Issues between
them. Thereupon, in most dramatic fash
ion, Tillman challenged his colleague to
resign on the spot. "Let us draw up the
papers now," said he, "and tender them
to this man (pointing to the presiding of
ficer), and that will settle it."
All eyes were turned upon McLaurin,
but the latter did not rise from his seat
or make reply.
Hoar â¢ explained in detail the occasion
upon which Speaker Blaine had held that
a resignation immediately vacated a seat
ih the House, and said a resolution for the
expulsion of a member from South Caro
lina was about to be voted upon, and the
member, knowing that the resolution
would be adopted, sent his resignation to
the chair, with the intention of address
ing the House and then offering it before
the vote on the resolution was taken. As
soon as Speaker Blaine saw the nature of
the communication sent to him he .imme
diately declared the seat vacant, thus put
ting an end to all further proceedings.
Hoar contended that if the facts bearing
upon the case of the South Carolina Sen
ators had been correctly stated it was
doubtful whether they were entitled to
seats- upon the floor of the Senate at this
time.
Tillman said if his colleague would pre
pare any document that would vacate his
seat as well as his (Tillman's) he would
be glad to sign it.
Lodge at this point announced smiling
ly that while the resignations were pre
paring he would move that the Senate go
into executive session. After a half-hour

STREETCAR STRIKE
CAUSES SERIOUS RIOT
Officers When Attacked ~Use Their
Revolvers and Wound Three
of the Mob.
SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 9.â The most
serious of the many riots which have oc
curred here during the street car strike
happened to-day. Special Omcer Prank
Schofleld, accompanied by Detective Cos
grove, . whose head was cut in Sunday's
riot, went to the scene of Sunday night's
disturbance to apprehend any one the
detective might be able to identify as
having been one of t-ie assailants. They
attempted to arrest a man in a saloon,
but no sooner was â¢ the warrant shown
than a crowd of miners attacKed them
with drills, clubs and bottles. They re
treated backward, protecting themselves
with drawn revolvers, when some one in
the mob fired two shots. The officers and a
non-union motorman who accompanied
them, emptied their â¢ revolvers, thereby
scattering the mob, and then ran. The
mob kept up a- steady fire from places of
concealment. Three of the mob were
shot, but their wounds are not serious.
Schofleld Is a striking conductor. He is
serving . as a special officer in a magis
trate's court to fill in time until the strike
shall be settled. â

PLEDGE VOTES
FOR EXCLUSION
Three Hundred and. Two
Members of Congress
So Decide.
Many Who Were Classed as
Doubtful Are Now in
Favor of the BilL
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9.â Since the Chinese
exclusion poll was published in The Call
last Thursday many replies have been re
ceived from members of Congress who
were then classed as doubtful. The re
sult to date shows that two-thirds of the
Senators and four-fifths of the Represen
tatives are pledged to vote for exclusion.
Senator Frye, who was considered doubt
ful, will vote for ih4 exclusion bilL So
will Senator Warren of Wyoming, who
was reported by a San Francisco paper to
be opposed to exclusion.
The unreliability of this paper's canvass
Is shown by the fact that Mondell of Wyo
ming was classed as doubtful, w&en as. a
matter of fact he Is one of the leading
spirits opposed to Chinese Immigration,
and has introduced a bill excluding the
Chinese.
Two hundred and eighty-eight Repre
sentatives have signified their Intention of
voting for exclusion out of a total mem
bership of S57, and lifty-four Senators out
of a total of eighty-eight (there are two
vacancies).
Senator Hawley writes: "You need have
no apprehension regarding the passage of
the exclusion bill."
Senator Stewart says: "There is no op
position so far as I can see."
The only outspoken opponent of exclu
sion is Henry C. Smith of Michigan. Oth
ers who were reported to be opposed have
now come out in favor of exclusion.
Fourteen Representatives, while not stat
ing positively how they will vote, predict
the passage of the exclusion bill. They
will all vote for exclusion, however. This
increases the grand total to 302.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â Senator Per
kins to-day introduced a Chinese exclu
sion bill, the provisions of which are the
same as those of the measure . prepared
by Chinese Inspector Dunn of San
Francisco and Commissioner Powderly
and Introduced In the House by Repre
gentatlva Kahn.
COUGHESS WILL BE ASKED
TO ERECT MEJIOBIAL ARCH
Directors of the National Association
Determine to Change the Plan
of Operation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 9.â The Wil
â¢ Ham McKinley National Arch Association
has determined to change its plan of
' operation, and to appeal to Congress in
stead of the public for the erection of the
proposed McKinley memorial la Wash
ington.
Secretary Gage offered the following
resolutions, which were seconded by
Thomas F. Walsh and adopted:
Whereap, Through a resolution presented to
this committee by the trustees of the McKin
ley Memorial Association, it is rumored that a
canvass of the country for subscriptions to the
proposed memorial arch in Washington will be
prejudicial if not destructive to the erection of
a proper monument or memorial over the re
mains of the late President at Canton; there
fore.
Resolved. That this committee give up its
appeal to the country for popular contributions
for the memorial arch in "Washington and turn
Its efforts. to secure from Congress an appro
priation from the public treasury sufficient in
amount to erect in Washington a memorial
which, in a fitting manner, shall represent the
nation's apprciation of the notable character
and distinguished public services of "William
McKinley.
The association will be relncorporated
and contributions received by the associ
ation for the proposed memorial arch will
be returned.

ST. SEVER BEATS JOHN PETERS
IN A VERY EXCITING FINISH
Schorr Colt Supposed to Be the Choicest Morsel on the Card at
| -'Oakland-Track ! Is Still Slow and Four Choices Go Down.
Doublet Comes :in Ahead of the English Horse, Royal, Flush
0NL.Y on rare occasions does
Johnny Schorr let one out of the
slips that ; falls to return with
the coin, but the astute young
trainer from Memphis stubbed
his toe at Oakland yesterday. The two
year-old John Peters, was served .-.up pip
ing hot off the coals in the two-year-old
event, and after the youngster's odds had
been cut and slashed from 5 down to
even money he was beaten out a head by
Dr.Rcwell's St. Sever, a 5 to 1 chance.
Possibly if Evander, with Winnie O'Con
nor; up, had been out of the race John
Peters might have won. The latter raced
away in front with him for several
panels and certainly did the Schorr entry
no- favor. Then after getting away from
one or two squalls "Jess" Matthews . hur
ried along with St. Sever and in a very
busy finish with Johnny Woods earned
the decision. Owen Mounce made a very
wide detour with Dr. ScharfE or else the
last named unlucky two-year-old might
have been a stronger factor at the finish.
At any rate, the admirers of the winner
were enabled to get a very long quota
tion.
Track Is Still Heavy.
The track had not dried up as much as
expected, still being noticeably freckled
with damp and heavy patches. Perhaps
to this fact can be attributed in part the
defeat of four favorites. The attendance
was quite up to the standard, and there
was a raft of coin in the ring.
Another of Harry Stover's "birds" left
his perch in a. gilded cage long enough to
scoop the opening dash. Backed from 9
to 5 to 13 to 10 or worse. Native flapped
his wings a couple of times and flew in
five lengths before Torsina. Nearly all
of the books were hard hit.
From his apparent lack of speed
Galanthus had not recovered from his
hard race of last Saturday. Jimmy Coir
fey*s horse ruled a stanch choice over
Herculean for the mile and a sixteenth
run, and turned out easy prey for the
giant chestnut. Bullman rode the latter,
finishing first by four lengths at the wire,
Darlene ran a fair third.
Frank Bell Meets Defeat.
An elaborate array of speed faced the
starter in the five and a half furlong
purse affair, with Frank Bell the closing
favorite at 9 to 5. It was figured that
the general conditions best fitted the St.
Louis "Hindoo," but he failed to connect,
erjding up in third place. Mounce on
Doublet rode a nicely judged race so far
as choosing the better going was con
cerned, and in an exciting three-neck
scrimmage in front of the judges won out
from the Britisher, Royal Flush, by a
neck. Beau Ormonde started for the
first time this season, and, heaviily
played; disappointed his backers. Still,
the aristocratic fellow ran a most be
coming race, and had he had the benefit
of a race in him would have taken a
world of beating.
Possessing the most speed of the party,
Orleans captured the mile selling run. It
was possibly farther than the filly cares
to run, but getting careful treatment at
the hands of O'Neil she downed Plohn a
neck. Bangor sulked the first part, as
usual, dropping in third.
P. Corrigan won his first purse at the
meeting with Commonwealth Attorney in
the closing seven furlong jaunt. The geld
ing went to the post at odds of 5 to 1
and in a drive beat the good thing,
Malaise, half a length. Diomed would
have won had he not been cut off at the
start.
Track Notes.
George Rose and Frank Eckert, two of
the best known and most popular book
makers on the big tracks of this country,
arrived here from, the East Sunday night.
Frank Kckert viewed the sport from tlie^
ground yesterday, but Mr. Rose will. rest,
up for a day or so before cutting in.,
Tom Quinn, one of the. cleverest block
men in the business, was kept busy shak
ing hands with friends yesterday, being a
fresh arrival from the Bast. Tom is a
brother of Charley, John and Jim Quinn.
Jake Holtman flned Johnny Woods $25

Tom Ryan was again on hand to bid
Dr. Dowell's St. Sever up. The gelding

Best Averages in. Batting and
Bowling.
At a meeting of the California Cricket
Association held last night the committee
on batting and bowling averages, consist-
Ing of H. C. Casidy, J. J. ' Moriarty and
A. G-. Sheath, reported that the best bat
ting average during : the season of 1901
was made by" Harold B. Richardson of
the Pacific Cricket. Club, and the best
bowling average was obtained by Bert
Bird of the Alameda Cricket Club. Dur
ing the season just past Harold B. Rich
ardson was eight times at bat, completed
six innings, and scored a total of 300 runs,
giving an average of 50 runs. His high
est score in a single inning was 103. - Bert
Bird took twenty-three .wickets for 150
runs, the average cost being 6.50. A. bat
was presented to Harold B. Richardson
and another to Bert Bird, the donor being
Captain John Metcalfe, first vice presi
dent i of the association. In- calculating
the averages all matches played, under
the auspices or with -the sanction of the
association were taken account of.
The pennant presented by Edward
Brcwn to the club making the best per
centage in pennant matches during the
season was awarded to the Alameda
Cricket Club, which played ten matches,
winning five, drawing two and losing
three, giving a percentage of .60.
The delegates were addressed by A. E.
Acklom, who stated' that cricket would
receive a great impetus if a suitable
ground and pavilion could be secured, and
suggested that a committee^, be appointed
to investigate the possibility of procuring
a ground and erecting > the necessary
building" thereon. â¢ The president will ap
point a 'committee of live \ for â¢- this pur
pose. *'.".. ''â¢ !* , â¢â  ' ,

"Dutch" Thurston Wins on a. Foul.
CHICAGO, Dec. 9.â "Dutch" Thurston,
the Pacific Coast Welter-weight, won on
a foul from Charley., Burns of Cincinnati
to-night at the American Athletic Club.
The contest was scheduled for six
lounds, but after two minutes,' fighting
in the first round Burns hit his opponent
low and Thurston was given the decision.
The foul was apparently an accident, as

EILIiIARD PLAYER SLOSSON,
RECEIVES A BAD BEATING
George Sutton of Chicago Easily, De
feats Trim at . the International .
.Tournament.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9.-The surprise of
the international billiard tournament
occurred to-day in the afternoon game
between George Sutton of 'Chicago and
George Slosson of New York. Slosson;
having won the bank, failed to score at
the start, and Sutton, by careful nursing
and open table play, rah up 39 points. He
followed this up by scores of 16, 22, 45,
20, 50 and 38, while Slosson was unable
to make any double figures. At the con
clusion of the seventh â¢ inning the score
stood 230 to 35 in Sutton's favor. From
this point to the end of the game Slos
son had no -chance of- winning, although
he played desperately. Sutton won the
game in an unfinished run of 34 in the
twentv - ninth inning. Score â Sutton,
400; Slosson. 136. -. . ,
The game in the evening, which was
between' Schaffer of 'Chicago and Barutel
of France, was -a very swift one. Sch'af
fer, after his three days' rest, 'Was in fine
form, and his nursing" of the balls was
equal to any of his best previous per
formances. In open table play he showed
wonderful dexterity. , . : . â¢
Barutel, while, badly beaten, played a
first-class game. Schaeffer will play
Morningstar to-morrow afternoon and in
the evening he will meet his old adver
sary, Slosson. Score â SchaefTer,-400; Bar
utel, 203.

McKEE VER-P ALMER FIGHT
IS A DISGRACEFUL FIASCO
Both Pugilists Resort to Foul Tactics
and the Referee Stops the
'Battle.
NEWCASTLE ' ON' TYNE, Dec. ' 9.â
Charlie McKeever of Philadelphia and
Jack Palmer met here to-night in what
was to have been a 15- round bout â  for a
purse of Â£350. McKeever weighed 148
and 'Palmer 166 pounds. Palmer fouled
repeatedly during the first round, Mc-
Keever clearly outclassing him. At the
beginning, of the second round the crowd
broke into the ring and a general fight
ensued. The referee, after declaring the
fight "no contest," made his escape.
LONDON, Dec. 9,â The sporting* papers
this morning describe last night's light
between McKeever and Palmer a dis
graceful fiasco. They say. that both
Palmer and McKeever continuously in
fringed the rules and ignored the warn
ings of the referee. They .indulged in
what Sporting Life calls a regular West
ern barroom scrap. Finally < the referee
stopped the. fight. : The police jumped on
the stage and threatened both the pugil
ists â  with i arrest. , A scene of pandemo
nium followed. â  â - â -'. â

CIGARMAKERS
SUFFER DEFEAT
Labor Leaders Refuse to
Boycott the Machine
;: - Made Goods.
Metal Trades Federation Or
ganizes and Elects
Officers.
SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 0.â The confer
ence'ot the American le nation of La
bor was in session omj iours to-day,
adjournment being tal... . ...i tomorrow
morning in order to ei-_i . .- the several
committees to consider u. large number
of resolutions still in their hands.
There was a lively discussion on the
floor over the question of boycotting ma
chine-made cigars.' It is the same ques
tion that the Cigar-makers' International
Union has brought up at previous conven
tions of the federation, and the union has
always been defeated in Its .light against
the introduction of machinery in the cigar
trade. <At the present time "not a ma
chine-made cigar In the United States, it
is said, bears the label of the Cigar-mak
ers' International Union. The matter
ciame up in the form of a resolution pre
sented by President Gompers, John C.
Durnell and Thomas F. Tracey of the
Cigar-maKers' bmon, and: was referred to
the committee on labels. It denounced a
certain company tor making cigars ; by
child labor and machine ana called upon
the federation to assist in unionizing the
various plants ot the company. The
committee reported the resolution back
with the recommendation that the word
"machinery" be stricken out and the res
olution adopted. The cigar-makers opened
their light. They insisted that the term
"machinery" should not be eliminated
and argued that cigars made by machin
ery are not as good as those made by
hand, and that the machine drives hand
cigar-makers out of business. The speak
ers in opposition to . the cigar-makers'
proposition argued that to oppose ma
chinery would be folly.
Machines are used In many lines of
trade and the union could not success
fully fight the law of progress.
The moving of the previous question
quickly ended the debate and the resolu
tion with the word "machinery" stricken
out was adopted as recommended.
The Metal Trades Federation, after a
series of meetings, finally organized to
day by electing officers. Another meet
ing will be held to-morrow to. dispose of
business still on hand. The following of
ficers were elected:
President, E. J. Lynch, New York, national
president of the Metal Pojishera; vice presi
dent, Robert Kerr. MoUne, III., national presi
dent of. the Blacksmiths; secretary-treasurer,
John .O'Leary, Worcester, Mass., president of
the Coremakers.
The executive committee will be com
posed of the above officers and all the
national presidents of other trades allied
with the Metal Federation. The person
nel of the company has not yet been
made up.
All of the trades in the Metal Federa
tion are affiliated with the American Fed
eration, and the object is to have an as
sociation that can deal directly with the
manufacturers, who are organized under
the name of the National Metal Trades
Association.
Fine Recdrd With Revolver.
STOCKTON, Dec. 9.â Henry Kroeckel,
inspector of rifle practice of. the Sixth
Regiment, National Guard of California,
who recently bxroke all rifle records at 50
yards on the Columbian target, surpassed
that performance yesterday, when he
scored 249 out of .a/ possible zjO at fifty
yeards, with a Colt's army 48-calIber re
volver, three-pound pull. The man-targei
was used and #11 the shots but one of the
fifty struck within a few Inches of'
the region of the'heart. There were forty
nine 5's and one 4. The first ten. shots
could have been covered by the hand,, so
close : were they together, and 80 per cent
of the shots could have been covered with
an ordinary hat. This score entitles
Kroeckel to compete In the State shoot at
Sacramento in January.
League of Patriots Is "Weakening.
PARIS, Dec. 9.â Paul Deroiilede, the
founder of the League of Patriots, an
nounces that his organ, Le Drapeau, will
from this time on cease . to be a dally
sheet and will return to its weekly form.
The change, which he admits is due to
want of support, does not indicate a very
flourishing condition of the League of
Patriots, of which Le Drapeau is the
mouthpiece. In fact, M. . Dero'ulede
says it has not yet been resolved whether
the Republican plebiscite group will take
part in the coming general elections as
a party. 'â â  â 
Many Elections to Choose Mayors.
BOSTON, Dec. 9.â Eighteen Massachu

tests in nearly every city. In Boston
three candidates are pitted against May
or Hart. To-night the Democratic man
agers declare that General Patrick A.
Collins, the party candidate; will be
elected Mayor by .7000 plurality, while the
Republicans are confident of re-electing
Mayor Hart by about 3000.

FORGING CHECKS
Bookkeeper of Swindled
Liverpool Bank Aids
Prosecution.
Sufficient Evidence at Hand
to Convict the Men
Under Arrest.
LONDON, Dec. 9.â Thomas Peterson
Goudie, the former bookkeeper of the
Bank of Liverpool; Dick Burge. the Eng
lish pugilist, and F. T. Kelly, the book
maker, of Bradford, were arraigned at
the Bow-street Police Court to-day in
connection with the Liverpool Bank
frauds. Prosecuting counsel announced
that Goudie admitted he had forged
checks, but disputed the aggregate
amount. The statement of counsel was
mostly a reiteration of facts already
known The most interesting point was
the announcement made by counsel that
he would be able to prove that after
Kelly had "milked" Goudie to the ex
tent of Â£72,000 Burge got wind of the sit
uation and in conjunction with Laurie
Marks, the American bookmaker, who i3
said to have committed suicide by jump
ing overboard from a channel steamer,
and James Mances, a bookmaker well
known on the American tracks, decided
not to leave Goudie in the hands of
Kelly. The trio thereupon dispatched
Mances to interview Goudie, with the re
sult that they accumulated Â£91,000, of
which Burge received one-half, Mancea
one-third and Marks one-sixth.
FKENCH FINANCE MINISTER
BEPLIES TO HIS CRITICS
Says That the Present Legislature
Will Produce a Larger Surplus '
Than Ever Before.
PARIS, Dec. 9.â In the Chamber of
Deputies to-day the Minister of Finance,
M. Caillaux, replied to criticisms of the
budget proposals and to the pessimistic
predictions of the adversaries of the re
public. The Minister said the year 1901
will develop a net deficit of 59,000,000
francs, but when the preceding surpluses
are taken into consideration it will be
found that the present Legislature pro
duced a surplus of 275,000,000 francs, which
no Legislature had ever done before.
The Finance Minister also said a gen
eral crisis existed in consequence of the
South African war, which had an unfa
vorable influence on the French budget.
In this regard, however, France had suf
fered less than other countries.

City Attorney Discovers
Flaws in Utilities
Proposition.
Affect Plans to Acquire
"Water Supply and Street
Railroad.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
â¢was compelled to postpone consideration
of the declaratory ordinance regarding
the acquisition of public utilities in the
form of a municipal water supply and the
Ge* ; street railroad. This action was
neoWssitated by the receipt of the City At
torneys opinion, advising that the ordin
ances are insufficient and the preliminary
proceedings must be made in conformity
with the charter.
Lane advises that to make the bond is
eue on the proposition of water works
legal It Is necessary to secure estimates
of all of the several available sources of
â¢water supplies. The opinion says:
Charter Has Not Been Obeyed.
I bear to direct your attention to the lan-
CUMJS of the charter. The Supervisors . must
procure plans and estimates of the cost of ob
taining Irom â¢â¢all" of the several available
sources a sufficient supply of water. If thiÂ«
has been done, then this declaration of the
bill is not subject to question, but If it has
not been done the mere declaration of the
board is not sufficient to save a 'bond Issue
based thereon. The statement by the board
that it has taken the preliminary steps will
not be regarded as conclusive evidence that
these eteps have been taken. The plans and
estimates of water works given by the City
Engineer constitute what is called by him a
"progress report"; they do not purport to be,
nor <5o I understand them to be, complete and
finaJ; they do not contain, Tor Instance, any
plan* for a flistributlrs system in this city.
although an estimate of cost for such distribu
ting system has been made. The charter does
not contemplate that your decision will be
t&ken upon an incomplete set of plans and
estimates, and . before any declaratory bill is
passed the plans and estimates required by
the charter should be received by the board.
The charter would seem to stiggest that sev
eral propositions respecting the acquisition of
one kind of utility might be submitted to the
elect rs. If not, -why require offers of sale
froTT existing utilities, ln order that the "elec
tcrs 1 '' shall have the benefit of acquiring the
eanie at the lowest possible cost thereof? My
construction of this provision would be that
the Supervisors were required to solicit and
consider offers of sale from existing utilities
ln order that the Supervisors themselves might
be able to judge whether to submit a proposi
tion for the construction of a new plant or
the purchase of the existing one, and also that
the people might compare the comparative
cost of the two propositions. This may be what
the charter means, but the expression of the
Idea Is not sufficiently clear to put It beyond
Question.
And at what stage in the proceedings is the
Board of Supervisors to call upon, existing util
ities for their offers to sell? The charter says
"before submitting propositions to the electors
for the acquisition by original construction or
condemnation." But whether such solicitation
and consideration cf offers to sell shall be made
before the declaratory bill is passed or after
floes not appear. If before the declaratory bill
:s passed, as has been done ln this case the
cSer to eell would be requested before there
was any official determination by the board
that It intended to acquire such utility.
Street Uailroad Proposition.
Lane also filed an opinion on the suffi
ciency of the ordinance declaring- that
public Interest demands the acquisition of
a street railroad. The opinion says:
Under the ordinance es passed to print no
definite proposition is declared for. The street
railroad, the acquisition and construction of
which is demanded by public interest, is not
Â«*anitely located. It is not sufficient, ln my
. LitrmenL to say that public Interest demands
railroad without giving it termini,
1 r^ute or character. I take it that the Super
visors wish to express their determination that
public interest demands that a certain street
railroad shall be constructed by the city, run
i ing over and upon certain streets, -with a cer
tain number of tracks thereon. This should ap
pear ln the bllL

Oriental rugs
for Christmas gilts
Can you think of anythingâ ANYTHINGâ in the wide
range of gift suggestions that would be more acceptable than
p a genuine hand-made rug imported from the" sunrise lands of
h Persia, Turkey or India?
H What an enchanting: atmosphere of mysticism hovers around
l| these gorgeous floor coverings from the Far East! We of busy,
$ modern America can hardly realize that in one of these maRnifi-
H cent rugs is oft reflected the personal history of its patient
b maker â his sorrows, his joys, his hopes and his fears are woven
â  Â« j n to its curious designs and colors. Weeks, months, and some-
1 â  times years of toil are represented in a single rug, and not only
R keen diplomacy but a tempting tender of coin is often necessary
p to induce the maker to part with such a piece. And how an
m Oriental rug does wear! Even the poorest will outlive more
Q than one generation of ownership. .Â»â¢
ti One of the most magnificent and comprehensive collections
{1 of Oriental rugs in the West is here, and this is probably the
U ONLY store on-the Pacific Coast where these imported woven
1 perns are priced on a modern business basis â a reasonable mar- .
â¢ gin of profit added to the actual cost. For instance:

ESTABLISHES NEW RECOBD.
Hind, Rolph & Co.'s Barkentine La-
haina Makes Steamer Time.
The new barkentine Lahaina, built by
Boole & Son for Hind, Rolph & Co., has
Just completed a phenomenal run. She
went from here to the Sound .in record
time, and from Tacoma, lumber laden,
made a splendid run to China. She start
ed from Shanghai in ballast for Victoria,
B. C, and made the run in thirty-two
days. This Is the best run on record and
stamps the Lahaina as one of the finest
vessels of her class afloat. This is her
maiden voyage, and the owners are more
than satisiied with the showing, while the
builders are jubilant.
Where Is the MatteawanP.
The steam collier Matteawan left Nanal
mo, B. C, more than a week ago for San
Francisco and has not been heard from
since. She has more than 4000 tons of coal
aboard, and was surely ' caught in the
gales that raged off Flattery and the Co
lumbia River.- Mariners seem to think she
was driven offshore and that some portion
of her machinery has been disabled.
Whatever has happened to her the fact
still remains that she is several days
overdue and the underwriters are willing
to reinsure their risks.
A Disaster Beported.
The Merchants' Exchange received a
telegram from Aberdeen yesterday to the
effect that a four-masted steel vessel Is
ashore twelve miles north of the entrance
to Grays Harbor. Tugs have been sent
to her assistance.
The Prince Albert Is Safe.
The Norwegian bark Prince . Albert,
which left Vancouver, B.C., for Queens
borough, England, 211 days ago, has been
spoken off Deal. She was considered long
overdue and 30 per cent reinsurance was
paid on her. When the news of her speak,
mg -reached the Merchants' Exchange
yesterday she was wiped off the board
and is now considered as safe.
The Roanoke has not been condemned,
nor is she likely to be. In that event 6hc
will be considered to have arrived, and
those who gambled on her "not to arrive"
will lose their money. Should the vessel
be in condition to start on another voy
age, even if it were only to Hilo or an
island adjacent to Honolulu, where she
now lies, that run would be sufficient to
constitute an arrival, and ' the gamblers
on the other end would lose. As ijt is.
there is only $2500 up that the Roanoke
would be a total loss, so no one will be a
very great loser. . . â¢ â 
The Ralph J. Long Overdue.
The schooner Ralph J. Long left Nome
last January in charge of Captain Green,
and the many friends of the jolly skipper
are wondering -what has become of him.
A few days ago he was spoken off the
Straits of Fuca, but since then all .trace
of him has been lost. It seems that the
Long and the Cordelia Heald have been
having about the same sort of an expe
rience. The former has been trying to
reach San Francisco, while â¢ the â  Heald
wants to reach the gold fields. . Sailors
say Captain Heald. and Captain (Green
would better change ships. â  -
Christmas on the Nippon Maru.
Harry Allen, the genial steward of the
Nippon Maru,. has made all his arrange
ments for a- jolly Christmas on the vessel.

Brandenstein opposed the selection of
the Mechanics' Pavilion site for the Car
negie library, and argued in favor of the
Fair estate site on California street, be
cause $400,000 could be saved by purchas
ing the last named site. He moved to
substitute the Fair, estate, as it offered
more advantages from an architectural
point of view. Wilson held that the Fair
site is inaccessible as compared with the
pavilion location, but Brandenstein held
that the car lines gave exceptional trans
fer facilities and the branch libraries
would answer their own purposes. Bran
densteln's motion to substitute the Fair
site was lost and the selection of the
Mechanics' Pavilion site prevailed.
The St. Mary's Square and Twin Peaks
improvement propositions were referred
back to the Public Utilities Committee.
The Board of Works submitted .an ap
praisement of the lands proposed to be
acquired for St. Mary's Square, bounded
by California, Dupont, Pine and Qulncy
streets, at $90,000. and the tract bounded
by California, Qulncy, Pine and St.
Mary's streets, at 5123,000, a total of
$215,000.
A resolution was adopted providing: that
the proposition to acquire five additional
sites for fire houses, to construct thirteen
buildings, and to make alterations to
buildings, at an estimated cost of $330,000,
be not submitted to the electors at the
proposed bond election. Similar action was
taken on the bill to issue bonds for $1,
000.000, to repave accepted streets.

STOPS LOBOS
CREEK PUMPS
Spring Valley Allays
Uneasiness of Its
Customers.
Asks Supervisors to Select
Experts Who Are Non-
Residents.
The resolution condemning the water of
Lobos Creek ' as unsuitable for drinking
purposes and- ordering the Spring Valley
Water Company to forthwith discontinue
supplying the water to consumers was de
ferred one week by the Board of Super
visors yesterday.,
The resolution recites that the water
of Lobos Creek contains, according to the
written reports .and oral testimony of
competent experts, unmistakable evidence
of sewage contamination, thus proving
that an epidemic of such diseases as
typhoid fever may be produced by the use
of the water if said diseases should ap
pearÂ»ln the habitations In the watershed
of the creek. Also that in the watershed
there are numerous habitations, hospitals
and cemeteries, thus rendering the danger
much ereater.
Chiet Engineer Schussler in a communi
cation notified the board that the com
pany on Sunday stopped the pumps at
Ixtbos Creek so as'to allay any anxiety of
the citizens living in the districts partly
supplied therefrom. The communication
says: .
SAN FRANCISCO. December 9, 1901.
To the Honorable Board or Supervisors of
the city and county of San Francisco-Gen
tlemen: Although the chemical, as well as
the bacteriological examinations of Lobos
Creek water made by Professor Hllgard and
Dr. Mouser, respectively, show the quality of
the water to be ' good and potable, and
although â¢ .we note â  that the health report of
November shows a marked decrease in the
number of typhoid cases ln the city from the
preceding month (viz.. five cases in November
against eight in October), we yesterday
stopped the pumps (which had been started
November 1st), so as to allay any anxiety of
the citizens living in the districts partly sup
plied therefrom. We propose to build a high,
close, wire fence along the top of the south
bank, so as - to keep off trespassers, and aa
the center of the creek â¢ is the boundary be
tween our property and the Presidio, we shall
request the commanding officer in charge to
allow us to build - a similar fence along the
top of the north bank of the creek, so as to
absolutely prevent the soldiers, during target
practice and at other times, from committing
any nuisance In the neighborhood of the creek.
The creek, although representing only
about '8 per -cent of our average dally con
sumption, is such a valuable addition to our
works, owing to the' good quality of the wa
ter and the constancy of its flow, that we
want to do everything ln our power to protect
It. We are also- satisfied that If the creek
were the property of the municipality the city
would undoubtedly do everything In Its power
to protect and utilize it.
There being a . variance between the reports
of the city's experts and ours, and both aides
claiming to be in the right, we take the lib
erty of sugRegtinjc. that . the chairman of the
Hospital and .Health Committee and the
thief engineer of the Spring Valley Water
Works jointly > agree upon a chemist and a
bacteriologist, '. both being non-residents of San
Francisco, to carefully investigate the quality
of the water <and. report. . Â«
Hoping that the - above proposition meets
your approval, we most respectfully ask that

BOARD RAISES
BOXING LICENSE
Professional Clubs Must
Pay $3000 Each
Yearly.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print an amended ordinance in
creasing the license on athletic clubs giv
ing professional boxing exhibitions from
$1200 to $3000 per annum. The original or
dinance, fixing the license at $5000 per an
num for each incorporated club, as rec
ommended by the joint Committee on
Judiciary and Police, was defeated.
D'Ancona stated that he did not favor
fixing such a high license solely with a
view to raising revenue for the city. Reed
said that the receipts of the clubs were
high enough to warrant them paying the
higner license. Heed objected to Easter a
rignt promoters coining to this city to
"gull the public," and said the higher
figure would drive out irresponsible peo
ple and put the sport "on the square."
He said the ordinance was fashioned
after the Horton law of New York.
Braunhart expressed surprise that Reed
had month after month recommended ua
a member of the Police Committee that
permits be granted to the very fight pro
moters whom he now denounced. Connor
moved to amend, tixlng the license ,\t
$3000. Curtis seconded Connor, but only
on the understanding that the board di'i
not bind itself to grant permits for as
many tights as they might apply for. The
amendment was lost by a vote of 5 to *,
but on motion to reconsider by Reed tho
measure was passed to print by ten votes
in its favor.
W-Dter Excursion to Mexican Ports
Low excursion rates to Mexican ports
will be offered by the Pacific Coa3t
Steamship Co. on the steamer Curacao,
sailing January 7. As the rainy season
is now over on the Mexican coast, excur
sionists will find this a delightful winter
trip. Time occupied will be about three
weeks.
action on the" resolution prepared by the Hos
pital and Health Committee be postponed
until the joint examination proposed above
can be had. Respectfully yours,
SPRING VALLEY WATER WORKS.
H. SCHUSSLER. Chief Engineer.
D'Ancona opposed the request of Chief
Engineer Schussler and argued that the
creek and its watershed should be con
demned, but agreed to a postponement for
one week. D'Ancona held that any ex
aminations to prove that the water is purs
must extend over a period of at least one
year. The resolution was re-referred to
the Health Committee, which will confer
with Chief Engineer Schussler on the sub
ject.
A resolution waa adopted directing all
corporations supplying water to the in
habitants of this city to file ln January
detailed statements, to be used in fixing
water rates for the ensuing year.
Held for Robbery.
Jackson Williams, a colored man. was
held to answer before the Superior Court
by Judge Cabaniss yesterday on a charge
of robbery in J20C0 bonds. He is accused
of robbing Harry Carlson, a sailor, living
at 414 Folsom street, early Saturday
morning in front of a restaurant at Val

IS THE COMBINE A SCHEME?
THE rumor persistently recurs in financial circles
in New York that the railroad combine is in
tended by its manipulators to lead to Govern
ment ownership of all the railways in the country.
It is pointed out that the leaders in the movement
are not without political influence and have the power
to control a considerable section of the press. The
process is declared to be simple. Let the Govern;
ment acquire the stocks of the lines at an appraised
valuation by direct purchase, and then guarantee the
interest on the bonded debt and it is done; the roads
pass to public ownership and administration.
A glance at the operations of the roads will il-,
luminate the rumored plan. In 1898 the gross earn
ings per mile of road in this country were $6771, and
the net earnings o\-er operating expenses were $2111
per mile. Nearly 18 per cent of the gross earnings
went for bond interest, and 2 l A per cent for taxes.
In that year the net resources of the roads from all
sources were $389,666,574. The present capitalization
of all American roads is about thirteen billions of
dollars; the total national wealth is put at 102 billions
of dollars. If the Government take over the entire
tystem by an issue of thirteen billions of dollars in
bonds at 3 per cent, the annual interest charge will
be $390,000,000. It will be seen that when the waste
of public ownership and administration is applied to
the operation of the roads, there is a prospect of an
annual deficit in ad<* : *ion to this annual interest
charge, which must out of the taxpayers.
That the owne of the roads would make a good
bargain on these conditions needs no further expo
sition. Their investment would be perfectly secure
under the guarantee of the Government, and the peo
ple would have the satisfaction of Government owner
ship, and paying for it As that experiment in Eu
rope has shown an invariable increase of 20 per cent
in cost of operation over the cost of private owner
ship, and at rates of transportation from three to five
times higher than here, it will be seen that such in
crease will add yearly $186,400,000 to the cost of
operation.
But the present owners, with their bonds in their
pockets, will b.e free from care. There will be no
more bankrupt roads, with bonded debts to be scaled
and bondholders to be ruined.
Between 1876 and 1899, 842 different railways were
foreclosed in court. Their total mileage was 106,510
miles, and their stocks and bonds amounted to six
and a half billions. Foreclosure wiped out 36 per
cent of the bonds and 37 per cent of the stocks.
There will be other hard times and more foreclos
ures, if the Government do not take over their prop
erties, and none are more interested in running to
cover than the enormous investors who will be ex
posed to the destruction of a slump.
Therefore, it is not improbable that the rumor has
justification, and that the fanatics who see in Gov
ernment ownership a panacea are their tools and
certain newspapers their paid allies.
Now that the American people have taken to rais
ing money for the relief of the women and children
in the British concentration camps in South Africa
it will net be long before they will begin to urge the
Government to interfere on behalf of the Boers.
When the American begins to put his money up fdr
a cause he is getting ready to talk business.
According to the census reports of the salt in
dustry there was produced in 1899 in this country
75,939.095 bushels of salt, and as that is considerably
in excess of one bushel per capita for the population
it will be seen that as a people we can hardly be ac
cused of keeping ourselves too fresh.
As might have been expected the longest biography
in the new Congressional directory is that of Chaun
cey Depew. It contains a list of his most famous
orations, but as it says nothing of his approaching
marriage there will probably be a sequel. â¢
If Miss Stone, the famous missionary, had a hun
dred lives she would have lost them all in the fer
tile brains of irresponsible correspondents, who let
hardly a day pass without a new report of the ven
turesome woman.
OUBAN DEMANDS.
MANY delegations are visiting" Washington
from Cuba to insist upon free trade with the
island in sugar and tobacco. This demand is
varied by propositions to abate the tariff so far be
low the Dingley rates, as to deprive domestic"pro
ducers of protection. > J'
The American sugar and tobacco growers, being
agriculturists and to a degree unorganized, are per
haps not fully aware that free sugar from Cuba means
the gift^f about $260 per acre to the island planters,
and that their demand has many American advo
cates in Congress and out. These advocates proceed
on the philanthropic line. They insist that when
we declared war against Spain "we guaranteed the
prosperity of Cuba." From that text a sermon is
preached that appeals to charity and honor. If we
accept the text the premise is admitted and the con
clusion must be accepted.
But did we make any such guarantee?'- An exam
ination of the resolution declaring war fails to find
anything that can be tortured into any obligation to
make the Cubans prosperous. To have undertaken
such a responsibility would have been what Senator
Sumner called "a piece of preposterosity." We de
clared Cuba to be of right ' a free and independent
state, and declared that we would not acquire sov
ereignty of the island and would abdicate occupancy
upon the institution of a stable government. That is
alL No state is free and independent when another
has guaranteed its prosperity.
The United States is concerned only with the pros
perity of its own people, and that only so far as it
can be secured by financial stability and their pro
tection against the lavish production or cheap labor
of other countries. Otherwise they are expected to
carve out their own fortunes and dictate their own
destiny. It goes without saying" that acceptance of
the Cuban pretensions will seriously violate the obli
gation of this Government to its own people. As
our population increases and its wants grow more
complex, the profit of supplying them should be kept
at home, to the end that the ever-increasing demand
for the profitable employment of land and labor may
be met. The production of rice, sugar and tobacco
is a much needed means of diversifying our agri
culture. Each requires the employment of labor in
converting the raw material to human use. l\ that
production is left undisturbed and its profit untouched
it will grow beyond the domestic consumption and
our agricultural and manufacturing labor will be in
creased to produce and convert the raw .material for
foreign markets, as has been the case in the metal,
fabric, wood and leather manufactures.
Why, then, is it not the part of wisdom for our
Government to retain unabated its power to carry
out the constitutional injunction that it shall "provide
for the general welfare"?
Our taxpayers have contributed hundreds of mil
lions to the Spanish war and its collateral results. If
any of the statesmen think that they did this for the
purpose of inviting lush production and cheap labor
into competition with them, to reduce their profits,
obsolete their industries and invade their prosperity,
they are making a mistake, the serious ' nature : of
which will appear when the results become known to
the people.
Mr. Lawson, the Boston millionaire, is said to have
lost more than $11,000,000 in -the copper deal, but
inasmuch as he owns all the stock he held at first
and has the same copper mines the loss isj nothing
more than a Wall-street calculation on the value
of the stock, and it may be that the street has calcu
lated wrong. At any rate Mr. Lawson has not yet
lost anything except a speculative idea.
UP TO JUSTICE BROWN.
SINCE the decision of the Supreme Court in the
so-called "diamond rings case" has followed the
precedent set by the court in the decision of
the Porto Rico cases last spring, it has occasioned
comparatively little comment. In fact it was in the
nature of a foregone conclusion. Such interest as
exists in the matter therefore turns rather upon what
was not decided than upon what was. It was decided
that duties cannot be collected upon goods imported
into this country from the Philippines as the law now
stands, but it was not decided whether or no duties
upon goods sent to the Philippines from the United
States may be collected at Philippine ports. That
and other questions arising from our relations to the
Philippines will have to come up sooner or later.
What decision will be pronounced upon them is
known only to Mr. Justice Brown. On all of these
cases he is virtually the Supreme Court. It is up
to him to decide.
The position of Justice Brown is unique. The re
maining Justices of the court are divided on the
question of the relation of our island possessions to
the rest of the country. Justice Brown holds the
balance of power, and he holds it impartially, for he
favors one side about as often as the other. He may
not be strictly consistent in his views, but he is un
questionably fair and gives everybody a chance.
In the Dc Lima case decided last spring Chief
Justice Fuller and Justices llarlan, Pcckham and
Brewer held that immediately upon the ratification
of the treaty of peace Porto Rico ceased to be for
eign territory and became domestic. Brown agreed
with them, and consequently Shiras, White, Gray and
McKcn'n.i were left in a minority. In the Downes
case it was held by Shiras, White, Gray and Peck
ham that Congress has power to impose customs
duties upon trade between this country and Porto
Rico, and Brown agreed with them, consequently that
time it was the Chief Justice and Harlan, McKenna
and Brewer, who made up the minority. In the Phil
ippine case the relative positions of the Justices re
turn to what they were in the De Lima case, and
once more it is Justice Brown who' makes the de
cision and determines the law of the land.
The situation is not" conducive to confidence in
the court. It is evident we are. facing problems in
which the highest tribunal in the country is so equal
ly divided there is no means of forecasting what de
cisions will be given upon such new issues as will
inevitably arise. Four Justices believe the islands
have become a part of the United States and must be
governed- by Congress in accord with the constitu
tion; that their people. must enjoy full' freedom of
trade with other portions of the country. Four other
Justices hold: that the islands are not a part of the
United States, or at least that they are not domestic
territory within the meaning of the tariff act. Justice
Brown holds an intermediate position and decides
that the islands became domestic as soon as the treaty
of peace was ratified, but that Congress can establish
a separate tariff for them 'if it pleases. .
It has been said by lawyers that the "decisions 'vir
tually give us three kinds of territory and three kinds
of citizens. First, the States whose citizens are
clothed with full powers of sovereignty* and -.self
government; second, incorporated Territories whose
. , - â  â . '.....â 
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, 10, 1901.
citizens are entitled to freedom of trade - with -the'
States but are not entitled to vote, for: Presidential
electors or to have representation in the United States
Senate;; and third, unincorporated territories held, as
"appurtenances" to the Union, and whose: citizens
have no rights except such as Congress may choose
to grant.
Out of that complexity there are certain to arise
many perplexing questions. At present no one can
foresee what they will' be. All that we kno"w is that
so long as the membership of the Supreme Court re
mains as it is there will be division, and the settle
ment of each issue will be up to Justice Brown, who*
in such matters exercises a one-man power of the
first magnitude.
The South American delegates to the Pan-Ameri
can" Congress seem to be of the opinion that.inter
national arbitration will be a a good ' thing provided
there is no attempt made to arbitrate anything that
gives promise of war and a chance to upset a Govern
ment.
LONDON dispatches of yesterday announce that
immediately upftithe assembling of Parliament
- the Ministry will bring forward a plan for abol
ishing the concentration camps in South Africa and
substituting a better method of caring for the Boer
prisoners and refugees.. No information from an of
ficial source has been given concerning the nature of
the new plan, but it is believed it' will consist of dis
tributing the refugees throughout the more settled
and pea'ceable districts of the Transvaal instead of
herding them together as is the practice now.
The movement on the part of the Ministry is. a
victory of the moral sentiment of mankind against
so-called military necessity. From every part of the
civilized world there has arisen a protest against the
cruel policy which Weyler introduced in Cuba and
Kitchener has followed in South Africa. It is but
just to the British to recognize : that they have
themselves furnished many of the foremost and most
earnest of those who denounce the system. The
most effective blow was delivered by Miss Hobhouse,
a British nurse who went to the seat of war not to
sympathize with the Boers but to serve wherever
needed in her professional capacity, and whose report
of what she saw in the concentration camps aroused
the indignation of humane people in Great Britain
as well as in other countries.
American sympathy has promptly followed the.dis
closures of the condition of the camps., . At the pres
ent time in the East no public gatherings are more
largely attended than those held for the purpose of
raising money for the Boer prisoners, nor is there any
cause for which money is more liberally, contributed.
This manifestation of sentiment in America may well
serve the Ministry as a warning, for on the whole
the people of this country have not been at all pre
judiced or antagonistic to the British in the war. If
there be a change of sentiment now it will be because
the change is justified.
A recent circular issued by the Chicago Branch of
the American Transvaal League presents statistics of
the death rate in the camps from June to September,,
inclusive, showing that in June the rate was equiva
lent to an annual death rate of 190 per thousand. It
continued to increase month after month until in
September it amounted to an annual rate of 264 per
thousand. The death rate among the children in Sep
tember is given at the equivalent of an annual rate
of 433 per thousand.
Statistics coming from the Boer side may be more
or less exaggerated, but information from British
sources goc,s far to confirm them. The significance
of a yearly death rate of 264 per thousand may be
estimated from the fact that the normal yearly, death
rate in England and Wales is but eighteen per thou
sand. The Boers are known to be a robust and
hardy race, and it can readily be seen that so large
a death rate among them implies a fearful condition in
the concentration camps. Clearly then it- is high
time for the Ministry to put an end* to them.
A report from Princeton says that a protest against
the proposed extension of a trolley line has been
signed by "Grover Cleveland and other prominent
business^ men," so it seems that to pass from the
Presidency- to the rank of a "prominent citizen" is
easy; but when did Cleveland go into business?
THE Democracy proves still unable to rule its
own spirit. Mr. Bryan has degenerated into the
party scold. He lets go one day at Gorman
and the next at Wattersbn. He deifies himself by re
ferring to Senator John P. Jones as Judas Iscariot,
who has betrayed him, and scarcely suspends his duty
on the watch tower. long enough to care for .his
anaemic, cczematous, ring-wormed political offspring,
free silver. Hill has left Croker to smoke the pipe of
peace alone, and the Jackson Club of Omaha has
taken up Croker's fight and refuses to invite Hill to
dine with it on January 8, >.\
In Missouri the State officers and committcemen of
the party are in court telling tales on each other and
digging up cashbooks showing large donations from
all the corporations, and the corporations remark that
as the Democratic platform threatened their undoing
by unfriendly legislation they were justified in seeking
safety by "cash. They say that the wise corporation
only buys 'peace of those that threaten war.
The minority in the House of Representatives held
its caucus and immediately proceeded to quarrel over
every issue in sight. The New York contingent
submitted a wordy programme, which omitted free
silver, and a Bryanite moved to substitute the Kansas
City platform, and then the men who desire to run
the Government showed that they could not run their
own caucus nor agree upon anything, and the anxious
and perspiring leader, Mr. Richardson, secured. ran
adjournment without coming to any decision. This
leaves the minority to indulge in a go-as-you-piease,
and its political course will be merely a guerrilla
warfare.
The people will not trust a party that is composed
of disagreements. It is united in only one thing and
that is. opposition to whatever Republicans propose.
But that is the policy of destruction.' . The people
want a constructive policy. It is a rule of law and
logic that he who comes to negative and destroy, a
proposition must come with one to take its place!
The country is as yet unaware of any feasible
Democratic policy not already rejected by the people
upon which it can be invited back to power. Its con
dition .now . is .worse than', ever in its/history. It ; has
received the weakening accessions of Patterson,
Heitfelt and Duboise, the. Populists, who .have;car
ried into its councils nothing but further discord; and
is .worse off than before those Senators â¢crossed â  over.
Evidently the country must continue to look to -the
Republican party for affirmative and constructive' ieg
islatioh,. and : the â  responsibility . of "that -party is" in

The question "What country can claim the

Is one that no one can answer, for the
reason that beauty of face and sym

opinion and as diversified as there aro
individuals. What Is beautiful to one is
not to another. The matter of female
beauty is best explained by the expression
of a Frenchman to the effect that every
woman is beautiful in the eyes of the
man who loves her.

REVISING THE TARIFFS
FOR PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
Chairman Payne of the Ways and Means Committee of the
House Presents His Republican Colleagues a Bill Drawn
to Meet Conditions of Recent Supreme Court Decision
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.-Chair
man Payne of the Ways and
Means Committee to-day pre
sented to his Republican col-
leagues of the committee a
tariff bill for the Philippines, which he
had drawn to meet the conditions of the
recent Supreme Court decision. The Re
publican Jnembers of the committee met
at 10:30 to continue the discussion of the
Eubject. The meeting was executive and
tras preliminary to a meeting of the
full committee to-morrow, when a Philip
pine tariff measure will be submitted to
the Democratic members and voted upon.
The Payne bill is quite brief, with two
main featuresâ applying the Dingley law
bs against Philippine exports to this coun
try, and applying the Philippine commit
tee's tariff "schedule to goods entering the
Philippines. A further section grants a
rebate of customs tax on goods which
have paid an internal revenue tax in this
country. There is no proviso in the meas
ure that it shall be temporary, so that
the rates if imposed would be applicable
until Congress otherwise acted.
Payne's Bill Is Discussed.
As soon as the committee assembled
Payne offered his bill, and it opened an
extended discussion on the several fea
tures involved.
The meeting lasted until noon, at which
time no final action had been taken, and
the committee adjourned until 2 p. m. to
hear Secretary Root on the requirements
cf the situation.
During the morning discussion it devel
oped that Russell of Connecticut and
some other Republican members strongly
favored a proviso to the bill offered by
Payne by which the tariff rates would be
scaled down from 15 to 20 per cent on
goods passing between the United States
and the Philippines. This was urged on
the ground that Great Britain had now 40
per cent of the trade of the Philippines
and Germany and other European coun
tries held a certain percentage, while the
United States had but 8 per cent of the
trade. For this reason it was urged by
Russell that the United States should
have some concessions as against foreign
"LONG JOHN" WILKINS
IS DYING AT HOSPITAL
John Wilkins, familiarly known as
"Long John," a colored man, who has
been a conspicuous figure in every session
of the Legislature for many years, lies
dying at the Receiving Hospital.
Wilkins returned from the Oakland
racetrack early yesterday afternoon, and
boarding a McAllister street car at the
ferry building complained of feeling very
ill. He was standing on the rear plat
form of the car, and when opposite Sec
ond street he suddenly swooned and fell
off the car, striking on his head. In his
fall he knocked M. H. Clarkson off the
car, but he fortunately escaped uninjured.
Wilkins was carried to the sidewalk and
aa ambulance took him to the Receiving
Hospital, where It was discovered that he
was stricken with apoplexy. He failed to
recover consciousness and his death is
hourly expected.

Provision to Pay Drawbacks.
Secretary Root is preparing a bill which
he expects to submit to Congress in a day
or two fixing duties for the Philippines
to meet the Supreme Court's decision. The
latest phase requiring- consideration is the
application of the drawback laws to trade
between the Philippines and the United
States. It is expected that any tariff ar
rangement made will include a provision
for the payment of drawbacks on any
goods imported into the United States
and exported to the Philippines. It Is also
the purpose to provide for the remission
of Internal revenue taxes on goods other
wise liable to such tax but exported to
the Philippines.
The official opinion at the "War Depart
ment is strongly adverse to the proposi
tion which has been broached by some
Republican members of Congress to frame
a new tariff schedule for the Philippines.

Secretary Root, accompanied by Colonel
Edward, chief of the Insular division of
the War Department, was with the Re

Philippine tariff situation. Root empha
sized the fact that the new tariff of the
Philippine Commission had gone into ef
fect only a few weeks ago, on November
15, and he favored a continuance by Con
gress of the rates established by the com
mission.
Representative Russell thereupon deter
mined not to further urge the proposition
he had put forward earlier In the day for
a 15 per cent preference to American
goods.
The committee took no final action, ad
journing until to-morrow, when a measure
may be agreed upon.
After the meeting the members stated
that the discussions and the hearing of
Root has practically determined that the
Taft tariff rates of November 15 would
be applied against goods entering the
Philippines, and the Dingley rates against
goods entering the United States from
the Philippines. The proposal to grant a
rebate on duties on goods paying an In
ternal revenue tax is still under discus
sion.

termined to secure the possession of lit
tle Chin Ah YIng, a Chinese girl 9 years
of age, and Mrs. Kate B. Lake, manager

for the girl, but she refuses to give her
up.
Mrs. Lake is at present out of the State,
but an affidavit made by her was filed
yesterday in which she says that the
child If taken from her now will be ex
posed once again to the dangers from
which she was rescued.

sel Will""BeÂ« Made on
"Wednesday.

the case of the people versus James W.
Brown, the alleged lyncher, was sworn
this afternoon after, twelve . dayb* hard
work by counsel. Only two talesmen out

ined, and it seemed for a time that the
entire venire would be exhausted before
the jury was obtained. -..-â â -
The twelfth juror is J. N. Janes. Janes
said that he believed that in some cases
lynching was justifiable, but only in the
case of assailants of women and of men
who committed murder with robbery aa
the motive. â  â¢ .
After the jury had been sworn Judge
Harrington ordered it into the custody of
the Sheriff, with the usual admonition.
This procedure was objected to by Attor
ney Raker for. the defense, who declared
that it had never been the custom in this
county to remand a jury 'â  to the care of a
Sheriff until the case was submitted."
An adjournment until Wednesday , was
taken, because counsel for both sides de
sired to look over the testimony which
was taken before the Grand Jury and to
decide what witnesses examined then,
could be excused in this trial. The tran
script of the testimony taken before the
Grand Jury Is voluminous, aggregating
1800. typewritten pages. '

SPIRITS CAUSE
FMILY RUMPUS
Advise Mrs. Franklin
C/ Tubbs to Get a
Divorce;
She Is Told to Marry Neigh
bor Who Assists in the
Seance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Dec. 9.â There Is a race on
In the Superior Court between Franklin
C. Tubbs and his wife, in which the
former is endeavoring to recover property
and win the divorce goal by the aid of
allegations out of the ordinary. . The
Tubbs were' married â¢. in Iowa in 1894.
About that time Tubbs received a large
sum from the Government in back pen
sion money, which he ' invested in Los
Angeles real estate. Arriving in Everett,
he made a further investment of $2200 in
realty. ' â¢- ~ .
The year 1900, alleges the complaint, was
an 'eventful period for the matrimonial
firm of Tubbs and Tubbs. Mrs. Tubbs
fell into the hands of spiritualists. She
attended seances and listened to spirit
tongues malign her lord. At these
seances, the husband claims, it was the
custom of his wife to sit by the side of
Joseph Goldfinch. He charges Amanda
Jenkens, Joseph Goldfinch and Harry
Goldfinch with having alienated his wife's
affections.
-Tubbs says that this trio told his wife
in spiritualistic communications that he
was not of the elect and that she should
be- divorced from him, for the spirits had
decreed that she and Joseph Goldfinch
should be mates. Acting upon this in
spiration Mrs. Tubbs left her husband.
Mrs. Tubbs was notified on v March 12,
says the complaint, that the conspirators
had received a communication from the
spirits, who said it was time that she
discontinued her relations with Tubba.
After an Interview with his wife Tubbs
agreed to a divorce and gave her the
Everett property and a half -interest in
the Los Angeles realty. Tubbs says he
discovered, that his wife was about to
marry Joseph Goldfinch, so he wants his
property returned to him. - - -\

SIGNAL STATION
NEAR ST. JOHNS
Wireless Telegraphy May
Prevent Wrecks in
the Future.
Marconi's Latest Establish
ment Locat9d at Scene of
Many Disasters. '
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. JOHNS. N. F. (via North Sydney,
B. C), Dec. 9.â Slgnor Marconi and his
assistants were occupied to-day in un
packing instruments and removing bal
loons and other material .to the Cabot
memorial tower. With the balloons there
are several cylinders of compressed gas
for inflating purposes.
Another visit, this time in company with
several. Government officials, was paid to
Signal Hill, and the question of a site
upon which to conduct wireless tele
graphy experiments -was thoroughly dis
cussed. Near the tower are some old
buildings which were in use years ago,
when St. Johns was fortified, and Marconi
finally decided on one of these, selecting
that nearest a large well of water. A lo
cal firm will prepare the ground by cov
ering it with sheets of zinc.
Marconi cabled on Saturday to Liver
pool and New York, asking for the sailing
dates of the Cunard and other mail
steamers, in order that he may know
when to expect them near the Grand
Banks, where' he hopes to enter into com
munication with them.
Signal Hill, where the first experiments
will be made, is 700 feet above the sea
level.
Marconi expresses his conviction that
the station which it is proposed to erect
near here will be one of the most lmpor
tnt In the world. The many wrecks which
have occurred In recent years in the vi
cinity of Cape Race might have been
avoided if it had been possible for ships to
communicate with the shore and ascer
tain their position.
The interest of Marconi in this connec
tion was first aroused by the publication
by the Marine and Fisheries Department
of Newfoundland of a chart showing
points along the coast where in the past
nearly eighty steamships and other ves
sels have come to grief. It is estimated
that 600 or more lives have been lost by
these dlsastera, and property to the value
of over $20,000,000 destroyed.

Kail advices from New York say: "Demand
for currants Is quite active and there is more
inquiry for round lots, principally from the
West. The spot market continues very firm
et C^Wc for Amalias in barrels and 7%c for
cleaned in cartons. The Greek market is high
er, cables reporting an advance of about 6d.
Ftps are strong at the higher range and de
mand is excellent. Layers of good quality arc
hard to set under 9@9%c. Dates are in fair
request at unchanged quotations. Malaga dus
ter raisins are scarce and in active demand.
Valencia layers continue flrmly held at 7@7Uc,
according to quality. California loose musca
tels are quiet. Local seeded sell well at "c
for choice and 7^4c for fancy; coast seeded
at 7c for choice and 7',iS7V6c for fancy. Cal
ifornia layers are still in very light supply.
Evaporated apples are quiet.. Choice and fancy
are hÂ«ld rather firm, but prime and low grade
are dull and easy. Small fruits are quiet. .
"'Prunes are firm on the coast at from a
3c to a ZMfi basis for Santa Claras, new crop.
Outside coode are held mostly at a 2\c basis,
though some offerings are reported at less. Old
prunes are ottered at a t\c basis for all sizes
of Santa Clara, except 40-50g and 90-100s.
"A prominent oacker of prunes at San Jose.
Cal.. wired a broker here to-day declining
orders for new crop Santa Clara fruit on a
2=iÂ«c tour-tize basis, and reporting 3c as ab
solutely the bottom figure. It is stated in
coa?t advices that the quantity of new fruit
still available is very limited and that fully
75 i>er cent of the entire new crop has been
moved out of the State. So far as can be
learned the new crop of Santa Clara is now
reduced to a point where nothing is avail
able at any price outside of two sizes, namely,
40-uOs and 50-COs. Some packers hold these
sixes on the S! 4 c four-size basis f. o. b. in
bacs."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market
NEW YORK. Dec. 9.-There was a lively
shaking out of speculative long accounts in
stocks to-day, accompanied by a threatening
break in prices, which caused some alarm dur
ing the early hours of the day. In the after
noon there was a sudden about-face In specu
lative i*nUment. and a disorderly scrambuTin
sued among the bears to cover their short con
tracts. Amalgamated Copper continued to
m-iintain its conspicuous position, even with
the inci-ease in animation in the market to
day. The opening sales carried the stock back
1% to 60. and this proved the low level of the
dfcy. b'.u the demand dropped off as often as
the Â«tock approached Saturday's level, al
though determined support. was always offered
as it neared Â«S. The bears became alarmed at
the action of the stock, and In the last hour
rushed the price up to 71 in their frantic bid
ding aeainst each other. The final price was
but a ehade lower. The support offered to cop
per at the opening break prompted supporting
orders elsewhere, and the market steadied mo
mentarily, quite a iust of important stocks
rinlrs: & fraction over Saturday. . With a rise
in the call loan rate to 7 per cent. howe\-er
epeculatom took . fright and unloaded stock*
Prices eenerally touched the low point of the
day on this slump. &lth0ueh individual stocks
were forced down under subsequent attacks
carrying the whole market with them back to
about the . low level several times. St. Paul
was notably weak end fell 2% under Saturday.
Manhattan was also vigorously attacked' and
driven 2\i under Saturday. There was a good
deal of calling of â  loans, but in seeking: new
accommodations borrower* bid the rate up up
on themselves to a higher rate than was jÂ»ec
fssary. Judzing from subsequent developments.
The rulinc NUi were 6 per cent, or even 6V-,
and there seemed ample supply at thet figure
The perception of this fact emerged about the
â¢uie time that Amalgamated Copper began iu
rally. From a general level of a point or more
bÂ»uow Saturdays prices the morKet beÂ«tan to
move upward and sained momentum. There
wae a flight reaction before the close, but the
advance was renewed, making the closing ac
tive and strong at about the best. The Gould
railroed, Manhattan. New York Central,
Sugar, Pacillc Mail and General Electric were
all prominent in the rally, and the day closed
with net gains except in a lew instances. Tne
activity in the call loan market was reflected
In the sharp \ decline in , foreign exchange,
! which precluded all idea oÂ£ gold exports for
â¢ the present. Money was reported easier in
j London, Berlin and Paris to-day.
Railroad bonds weakened in sympathy with
1 stocks, but became irregular later. Wabash
debentures - gained nearly. 2 per cent. Total
bales (par value), $5.1S5,O0O.
\ United States bonus were all unchanged on
â  the last call.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegVam says: .
The stock market to-day was weak, being
dominated by copper, which opened 10s down,
although closing unchanged at Â£55 per- ton.
American stocks opened heavy on this slump
in copper, but rallied around midday on a
recovery in Rio Tlntos, which advanced from
41 to 42%. New York failed to support the
rise and the close was flat, with a further
break in the street. Prices ended about half
a point above the worst. London is inclined
to fear that America ie facing a money squeeze
at the end of the year. Predictions regarding
the. next Amalgamated Copper dividend place
it all the way from nothing to 1 per cent. Paris
is developing strength after the long weakness^
Gold recovered to 77s 2%d on Austrian buy
in?. ,
Silwr is flat on New York sales, and there
is a fall In price of the metal fn India.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. â  9.â Over-confidence among
the bears in the grain pits brought crlef to
many shorts to-day. Liquidation for profits
and short selling: brought a tremendous vol
ume of business, but the low prices which fol
lowed these weakening ! influences were . too
tempting to the big public and amid scenes of
the wildest confusion wheat was sent up to a
new crop record Drlce.
Wheat sold in great quantities at the open
ing. Conditions had changed; there was not
the same general clamor for the cereal from
the "country and there' was a " nervous feeling
resultant Irom the tumble of prices in Wall
street. In general there was an inducement
for people with high priced lines to take good
profits. Big houses with connections in .New
York, the Northwest and St. Louis were heavy
sellers, and Patten is reported to have un
loaded 1,000,000 bushels of wheat. As the mar
kets weakened in price they were met with a
renewal of outside buying, which was in such
bulk that.it could hardly have come from
scattered outsiders. Some of the persistent
bulls continued buying, and even at the top
prices at the opening thought the bargain a
good one. Conditions that usually govern wure
somewhat mixed. Cables were . not quite as
responsive as expected. Though the English
country markets were reported very strong
Northwestern receipts were falling off, but pri
mary receipts , showed a. good gain. 'The in
creases in breadstuffs on passage and in the
visible supply also were bearish factors. With
all these influences to abet the selling pressure
prices fell off badly. May options, which opened
%@%c higher to %@V4c lower at 82%@82Uc
steadily fell to 81%a Shorts were Jubilant and
rushed to put on more pressure. Then came
the- reaction -with the force of a whirlwind
Buying orders sprang up all around . and it
became woefully apparent that the market was
heavily oversold. In twenty minutes the price
for May was up again to 83%c, a new â¢ crop
record. The close was very strong, %c above
Saturday,- at 83%Â©83V4c a
Corn started strong because of the snow- and
rain, which, it was thought, might hinder
farmers deliveries. Heavy profit-taking- how
ever, made itself felt in a weakening of prices
Increased Western offerings and the slump iii
wheat caused a â¢ further decline until May
touched 67%c. Wheat strength, however came
to the rescue Just before the end of the ses-
aM^Hc.^ " P tO * 8t<5ady : ClOse '
After an opening at about steady prices oats
suffered a material loss ' under early heavy
liquidation from several of the most prominent
professionals. Prices were off at one time l%c
, below Saturday's close. When the strength In
wheat became manifest oats followed closing
comparatively firm, %c lower, at 46%c
Provisions were "rather heavy early 'affected
by the downward tendency in grains.'- On the
revival of the wheat strength,' however prices
responded. January pork closed 5c up - lard
5c higher and ribs unchanged. '

"The statistical â¢ position of this market
should warrant the prospect of a ready demand
for new crop arrivals when they begin. It la
understood from many reliable sources that the
bulk of the crop will move later this comtns
season than usual by some thirty to sixty days.

"An important feature has been the increass

doubled.

points of export, both domestic and foreign.
local requirements have undoubtedly perma

growth of coast population and the gradual
extension of trade in nearby fields. It is hoped

directions, and â¢ that the demand established

Greeted at Columbia by Old Friendsâ -Orpheum Gives One of

FOR the last week of their engage
ment at the Tivoll the Pollard
children give the London musi
cal comedy, new here, "In
Town." There Is just enough
Mot and rather more tune than is neces
sary for the building of the up-to-date
nusical comedy, and there is not a drab
aoment in the piece. The story turns
Dn the adventures "in town" of a noble
:hough frivolous duke, his jealous lady,
?rettv daughter, and a son who is a chip
jff the old block. A good natured but
mscrupulous man about town takes
joth father and sob under his wing and
irovides complications In his raanagc

foing briskly from one end of the

FIGURES WENT WRONG.
Something About Food That Save3
One From Brain Fag.
That food can make or break a man is
ehown in thousands of cases. If one's
work requires the use of the brain, the
food must furnish particles that will build
up the brain and replace the dally loss.
Many times people fall 111 not knowing
that the real cause of the trouble is the
lack of the right kind of food to keep the
body nourished.
As en illustration, a young man in
Chatham, Va.. sayss: "I have been em-
ployed for quite a time in a large tobacco
- here. My work required a
flr'eat deal of calculating, running up long
â¢knd tiresome columns of figures. Last
winter my health began to give out and
I lost from two to ten days out of every
tncr.th.
"I gradually got worn instead of better.
It was d!5covered that when I did work
manv mistakes crept Into my calculations
in s'nJte cf all I could do. , It was. of
course, brain fag and exhaustion. After
dr--zing along for several months I final-
ly Vave UP ra- v position, for every remedy
on earth that" 1 tried seemed to make mi
wuw instead of better, and I had to
force down what food I ate. hating {o see
mealtime come. ,â¢'-'Â« â 
"One day a friend said: 'Crider. do you
know there is a food called Grape-NuU
that I believe is made to fit just such
cases as yoursr The name rather at-
tracted me and I tried the food. The de-
licious. sweetish taste pleased me and I
reJished it. In about a week my old color
began to come back and I gained in
strength every Cay. Finally I weired
tr.d found 1 was gaining fast In flesh,- and
with the strength came the desire for
work and when I went back I found that
Xby tnir.d was as accurate as ever and
>eady to tackle anything.
"I now can do as much work as any
man and know exactly from what my
benefit wa* derived, and that Is from
Grape-Nuts. I feel that it is but fafr and

dancing and acting are no end clever and
amusing. Willie Pollard was Captain
Coddington, and the pocket comedian
gave a capital sketch of the man about
town. He has ginger, fun and speed in
everything he does, and promises to be
of the best In his line when he grows
a big man. Another baby genius is the
little Daphne, 6 years old, and every min
ute of her is a funny sparkle. She was
Shrimp, and kept things lively while she
was on deck. Ivy Pollard, who does Lord
Clanside's part, has one of the best voices
in the company, and used it well last
night, and also acted with ease. Jack
Pollard as the curate had an irresistible
ecclesiastical accent, and Master Hill
kept up well the Duke's end of things.
Madge Woodson is another clever mite,
and as the Duchess was a brilliant suc
cess. Connie Prebble, Minnie Topping,
May Topping and Emma Thomas were
all good, and the chorus work was sure
and spirited. The orchestra was at times
over loud and not always in good ryth
mic accord with the little singers.
Columbia.
Jefferson de Angelis made his appear
ance at the Columbia Theater last night
after an absence of many years and he
met with a most enthusiastic reception
from many of his old friends. After the
first act he was repeatedly called before
the curtain and there were loud calls for
a speech. He was finally compelled to
stop the clamor by delivering a very
witty and appropriate address, thanking
his hearers for their fluttering reception,
which showed that he had not been for
gotten in his native city. The piece
presented was an operatic comedy writ
ten bv Charles Klein, entitled "A Royal
Rogue." It is full of fun,, catchy songs
and witty dialogue. De Angelis is a com
edian of a high order, very much resem
bling Ferris Hartman, and sings fairly
well. His song "The General" was en
cored several times. On a few occasions
he descended to buffoonery, but -It was
possibly due to an undue exhilaration at
his reception. Henry Norman sang "Pop,
Pop, Pop," a drinking song with a cho
ius with splendid effect, and it had to be
repeated again and again. Helen Byron
Is a pretty girl and sings and dances in
a bewitching manner. There is a double
sextet which will become a great favor
ite and a topical song that the audience
cannot get enough of to satisfy it.
There is the semblance of a plot. Bab
tiste Ballou. keeper of a restaurant, is
pasÂ«ed off as a royal duke so that his
daughter can marry the son of a wealthy
widow. The comedy should have a suc
cessful run.
Grand Opera-House.
A large audience was present at the
Grand Opera-house last night to witness
the opening performance .of "A Wife's
Peril." The play is a very clever four
act comedy and is full of alternately
thrilling and amusing situations. Minnie
Seligman. the leading lady, showed in an
unmistakable way that her fame is well
deserved. In some of the emotional
scenes she fairly took the audience off its
feet and was treated to vehement-, ap
plause. Fred J. Butler also did excellent
work, which received hearty indorsement.
Herpchel Mayall, Charles, Waldron. Wil
liam Bernard and Caroline Cooks are all
old favorites? and appear at their best in
this production. The play is one of those
that made Sardou illustrious, and one
who wishes to see something unusually
good must not fail to witness "A Wife's
Peril."
Central.
"The Electrician," a melodrama entire
ly new to this city, was presented at Be
lasco & Thall's Central Theater last even-
Ing, and it is probable that It, will go
down In local theatrical history as, the
best play of its kind ever seen in, this city.
THE SAN : FRAN CISCO CALL, TliESDAYv DECEMBER 10, 1901;
THREE CLEVER MEMBERS OF
THE THEATRICAL PROFESSION
WHO ARE APPEARING HERE. .
The hero is an electrician, the plot is al)
about electricity and nearly everything
takes place in an electric power-house.
The management has seldom staged a
play more realistically than the present
one. The power-house, with dynamos in
full operation, is shown in the second act,
and throughout this act the stage Is en
tirely lighted by the electric sparks given
out by the operating dynamos. The villain
hits upon a fiendish plan for ridding him
self of his enemiesâ that of thrusting
them upon live wires. The hero, in turn,
makes of him a human conductor for the
immense current which lights the city of
Denver, having detected him in the act of
cutting the cable. In another act a scene
in the Denver National Bank is cleverly
reproduced. Hallett Thompson as Tom
Edson, the electrician, and Annette Mar
shall as the bank president's daughter
were the favorites of the evening, and the
other characters were well sustained by
the capable stock company. "Muldoon's
Picnic" is announced to follow.
Orpheum.
Patrons of the Orpheum are very much
pleased with the numbers presented this
week. The performance is full of clever
turns. La Belle Tortajada divides the
honors with Norma Whalley. The Span
ish beauty sings and dances with the
grace of a Carmen, while . Norma dis
plays her shapely limbs in fancy steps.
Flo Irwin and Walter Hawley present a
playlet in up-to-date slang entitled
"Caught With the Goods." Miss Irwin
sing? a few coon songs in her inimitable
style. The Dumond Parisian Minstrels
are ever popular. They sing in harmony
and handle their instruments with the
skill of artists. Fred Niblo has returned
and talks his audience into a happy
frame of mind. Werden and Shepard
present a number of new illustrated
songs that capture the fancy of the au
dience. The Fraser troupe are very fine
dancers and are popular with the audi
ence. W. H. McCart, who assists J.
Sherrie Matthews and Norma Whalley in
a funny, skit entitled "A Lawless Law
yer," is even better than Bulger, Mat
thews' old running mate. Sam Marion,
the clever dancer, is nimble and grace
ful. He is a local production and re
ceives a warm welcome at every perform
ance.
Alcazar.
Like firecrackers popping at the end of
a string on Chinese New Year were the
crackling and snickering and the "ha
has" and "tee liees" of a delighted audi
ence over the production of "Christopher
Junior" at the Alcazar last night. While
not as stirring and well knit as it should
be, the comedy is constructed on the
lines of probability and the fun is . sup
plied more by the cleverness of the actors
than by the lines themselves. Juliet Cros
by, Margaret Wycherly, Marlon Convere
and Marie Howe are a quartet of talent
not often seen on the same stage togeth
er. Mr. Alsop was in his happiest vein in
the name part, and Frank Bacon kept
the audience tittering, although he had
but one word to say in .all the play, and
that was "Hooray!" . Howard Scott as
the- millionaire merchant was up to his
reputation and Mr. Tracy's Whimper and
Mr. Moore's Job were artistic bits of work
In action and make-up. Mr. Hallam's
Major Hedway was a good picture of the
old soldier pursuing the ways of peace.
"Christopher" is a success and Is bright
and clean. : -
California.
The second performance of Clyde Fitch's
melodrama. "The Cowboy and the Lady,"
at the California Theater last night at
tracted a large audience. The minor de
fects Incidental to a first performance on
a stage to which the actors were not ac
customed were absent and the whole show
went through with a vim and a dash that
won the plaudits of the spectators. The
picturesque features of the play were fuily
drawn out, and each one entered Into the
spirit of the; drama. The introduced
sketches, savoring, much of vaudeville,
were excellently rendered and thoroughly
appreciated. The situations are sufficient
ly thrilling to make the whole perform
ance most enjoyable.
Fischer's Concert House.
Mmc. Charity Martin, the prima donna
soprano, and Slgnor G. S: Wanrell.vthe.
eminent basso, won an enthusiastic recall
from the large audience at Fischer's Con
cert House last night with their rendition
of the great duet from "La Forza â  del
Destine" â¢ Their voices blended perfectly
and the Verdl'music. was delightfully ren
dered. Mme." Martin also sang Arditi'6
"Melba Waltz Song," and Slgnor Warirell
gave the grand aria from "Nabucco". and

The hoproom at the Presidio Club was
far too small to accommodate the brave
men and fair ladles who crowded Its nar
row precincts last evening. It was the
farewell dance to the officers of the Fif
teenth Cavalry, who will shortly depart
for the scene of hostilities in Manila. So
ciety sent Its fairest buds and they looked
charming in their varicolored gowns.
The hall was tastefully and unostenta
tiously decorated. ! On the walls were tat
tered flags that spoke eloquently of se
vere engagements in which they were car
ried. On the platform the guidons of the
various commands stationed at the Pre
sidio hid the musicians from view. In
the rear of the hall yellow incandescent
lights shone through garlands of ever
greens. The decorations were in yellow,
out of compliment to the arm of the ser
vice that is denoted by that colorâ the
cavalry.
Those who did not dance found com
fortable nooks in various corners of the
clubhouse and chatted the j hours away.
Punches and refreshments were served
with a lavish hand. Taps was not blown
until midnight and the fair belles and
their escorts danced the hours away. The
success of the affair was due to the ener
getic work of the Presidio's hop commit
tee.
The guests were received and made at
home by captain and Mrs. Andrews, Cap
tain and Mrs. Bainhard, Dr. Collln, Lieu
tenant Babcock and Lieutenant Brower. â¢
Miss Viva A. Baldwin, who leaves this
city on the 16th to become the bride of

ers Blaze That Was Consuming the Gh|ld*s^Â®rments
0AKIM.ND, Dec. 9.â The rare pres
ence of mind and prompt assist
ance of Mrs. Marion Rainey, her
teacher, saved little sev.en-year-
â¢ old Emma Cummings from a hor
rible death by fire this morning. In the
Lincoln School. During the 10 o'clock re
cess the little girl had fallen into a small
pool of water in the yard, and at the time
of the accident was drying her clothes
before the fire - in the schoolroom. In
some manner her dress became ignited
and the child ran screaming into the hall,
where Mrs. 1 Rainey was watching the line
of pupils just coming in from recess.
With rare presence of mind, Mrs. Rai
ney ordered the doors closed and, snatch
ing a shawl from her shoulders, wrapped
it about the blazing clothes of the little
girl and rolled her on the floor. Miss Re
becca Bills, another teacher, and some of
the older pupils came to her assistance
with coats and wraps and the flame3
were soon extinguished. The : child' es
caped without being seriously burned.
Mrs. Rainey's hand was blistered in her
heroic efforts to save the child.
The pupils who ' witnessed the accident
were quite unnerved, several of them be
coming so hysterical that they Jiad to be
sent home. The majority of them were
soon quieted, however, by the teachers, and
the little victim herself was the calmest
one there. She is the only child of Mr.
and Mrs. J. Cummings of - 315 Tenth

WHEELMAN TRIES
TO KIDNAP CHILD
Picks Up Little Girl
on a Street in Los
Angeles.'
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 9.â An attempt
was made at 8 o'clock to-night by a man
on a bicycle to steal the 7-year-old daugh
ter of Henry Fisher, a junk dealer at 915
East First street. The little girl was
playing on the sidewalk with another
child. A man riding a wheel, who Is de
scribed by them as tall and thin, stopped
near the curb and asked the Fisher girl
if she would like to have some candy. She
replied that she would not.
"Oh, but you must have some; come
along," said the man, who had left his
wheel. He caught the child by the back
of the neck very roughly with one hand
and by the legs with the other.
Just as he was about to mount his bicy
cle the little girl's brother, * aged 13, at
tracted by her cries and those of -her lit
tle playmate, came to the rescue. The
boy seized the would-be kidnaper by the
arm. The culprit kicked him cruelly. The
cries of the children had by this time at
tracted attention and several men ran to
the spot. Seeing himself about- to be
seized the unknown bicyclist dropped the
child to the sidewalk, jumped upon his
wheel and rode down toward the river. He
was lost in the darkness long before' a
concerted pursuit could be organized.
Little Ida Fisher had several scratches
about the neck and body inflicted by the
nails of her assailant. The attempted,ab
duction was reported at police headquar
ters by the father of the child.

When leaving Colon the Liberals for

cable filed by General Domingo Diaz,
chief of the revolutionists, with the Eng
lish Cable Company, some hours after
his evacuation of Colon. It is addressed
to President ; Castro and 'reads:
Colon, Nov. 24.â To â¢ President* Castro,
Caracas: Colon is in the possesion of

Government offered to arbitrate the dif

answer to the chief executive of Ven

Thanks for your Excellency's answer. The
Colombian Government officials - communicate
that they believed that they could accept medi
ation, and that when the opportunity arrives
each country would set forth its grievances and
complaints and put forward claims to indemni
fication to which it believed Itself entitled,
backing its demands with documents and docu
mentary . proof and accepting the calm and
impartial award of the mediator. I regret to
communicate to your Excellency that the Co
lombian' Government considers that the condi
tions indicated by your Excellency cannot be
honorably accepted by Colombia. I also pro
foundly regret, as well in the name of my
Government as in my own name, .not having
been able to obtain the re-establishment of the
most complete harmony between these two gov

DIPLOMACY MAY
INDUCE ILLNESS
Secretary of the German
Treasury Suddenly
Stricken.
BERLIN, Dec. 9.â Dr. Hasse, the Pan-
German leader in the Reichstag, has been
defeated, at least temporarily, in his pur
pose of bringing the Edinburgh speech of
Britlsl} Colonial Secretary Chamberlain
before the Reichstag by. the sudden and
possibly diplomatic illness of Dr. von
Thielmann, the Secretary of the Treasury."
It was Dr. Hasee's intention to start a dis
cussion on Chamberlain's remarks during
an interpellation to-day on the subject of
veterans' pensions. The promised . sensa
tion is postponed by the announcement
that Dr. von Thielmann, who was to have
replied to the interpellation, is suffering
from influenza.
Count von Ballestrem, the president of
the Reichstag,' announced to that body, to
day that Dr. von Thielmann had suddenly
become severely ill and was unable to re
ply to the Interpellation on the subject
of the veterans' pensions. Consequently,
after a few droning speeches on the tariff
bill, the house adjourned.
Count von Bulow may reply to an in
terpellation concerning the situation in
Poland to-morrow, although this is far
from -certain. It Is certain, however, that
the Government is much vexed . over the
recent uproar in Poland and the adverse
criticism abroad, caused by the convic
tions ' of Polish parents -who mobbed
Prussian school teachers who had flogged
Polish children for refusing to learn- the
catechism and- prayers in "German, v --^>'t
Two thousand Poles met in Berlin last
night and held a- demonstration against
the Government. 'The ohainnaji of the
meeting, Herr Wrobel. affirmed that the
recent Polish agitation at "Warsaw and
Lemberg* was proof of the continued
solidarity ' of the Polish people, whether
the subjects of Germany, Russia or Aus
tria. The efforts of Prussia forcibly to
Germanize its slices of Poland were fail
ing to-day, he said, as they had always
failed. - *
The Polish agitation, although afford
ing good material for the British news
paper correspondents, who are making a
good deal oat of it, is not considered acute
by the best observers here. .

HELPS HIMSELF
TO THE FREIGHT
Southern Pacific Com
pany Robbed by an.
Ex-Convict.
Most of Stolen Property Is
Recovered by Detec
tives.
Sam Clements, a notorious ex-convici,
was arrested on Saturday afternoon at
the corner of Bush and ' Kearny streets
and his name was placed on the small
book pending the Investigation of Detec
tives Kyan and O'Dea and Special OnÂ»
cers Dt win and Klndelon of the Southern
Pacific Company. The officers In charee
of the case have etnee secured sufficient
evidence to warrant the making of threa
charges of grand larceny against Clem
ents. His alleged Daniel Cur
isn. & second hand dealer at 1123 Market
eireoi. was also . arrested and charged
with receiving stolen goods.
For some time past packuges of freight
have been missing from the delivery
sheds of the Southern Paciflc Company
at Fourth and King streets. Suspicion
was directed against ~ Clements ' and a
watch was set upon him. When the strike
commenced Clements obtained a position
with Schussler. the drayman, and learned
the ways of the shed. He was the first
man severely beaten by the strikers, but
he returned to his work as soon- as' he
was able to be about.
The detectives who have worked up the
case against Clements are satisfied that
had It not been for the presence of the
officers who were detailed to watch his
truck he would have secured considerable
more property. As it is, however, the
detectives have recovered property val
ued at $3uOO and have woven a net of e vi-
Gence around Clements and Curtin tnat
may result In long: terms 01 Imprisonment
lor both. â¢ - - '
prlsonment for both.
Thefts Committed by Clements.
Clements' series of thefts which the'de
tectives have so far tastened on him are
fas follows: On -November 16, from, the
local delivery shed, where he obtained
ail the stolen property, he got two cases
containing respectively 50m) and W.Otw
ci&ars. on .November 19 he secured 1W
cozen pairs of socks. On November 22
he got a crate containing- four cases of
vaseline and two cases of wine bitters.
On .Friday last he attempted to take
JO.oOu cigars contained in two cases, but
as a special ,omcer was detailed to watch
him he left the cases ostensibly to get
a shipping receipt for the goods. While
be was going after the alleged shipping
receipt he incidentally picked up two rolls
of matting In another shed. All the prop
erty has now been recovered and elem
ents admits all the charges made against
him. Curtin, who received the property,
also admits his participation in the
crimes.
Clements' methods were very simple.
He procured a truck and drove to the
delivery sheds. As he was well known
there but little attention was paid to him.
He would fold a shipping receipt In his
mouth, take a hand truck and run the
merchandise out. Then he would drive
off and sell the property to Curtin for
whatever amount the latter was willing
to give. Sometimes he received as mucn
as {150.
Has Long Criminal Record.
Clements is about forty years of age
and has a long criminal record. He goes
under the aliases of Frank Fuller and
Frank Williams. He was first sent to
San Quentin on October 7. 1183, for six
years for burglary. On July 18, 1889, he
was sentenced to four years on a similar
charge. In August, 1897, he received a
sentence of two years and a half in Fol-
Bom on a burglary charge. On November
10, 1899, he was sentenced to thirty days
In the County Jail on a conviction for
petty larceny. On February 15 of this
year he was arrested on a charge of burg
lary, but it was reduced to petty larceny
and he served a sentence of six months.
In the last case a. woman known as Ethel
Griffiths, and who posed as his wife, was
also convicted and served the same time.
The Southern Paciflc Company will
specially prosecute the case against Clem
ents.
Great credit Is due the officers who made
the arrest for the manner In which they
worked up the cases against* Clements
and Curtin. Detective Ryan went to Cur
tin's place a few days ago to recover some
property which he learned was hidden
there. He was bitten on the leg by a
bulldog belonging to Curtin. Later, on
the same day. Special Officer Lewin saw
a bargain sale of socks in a furnishing
goods store on Seventh street and pro
cured a search warrant, recovering all
but a few pairs that had been sold. Last
night the officers In the case recovered
a large quantity of the stolen cigars,
which had been hidden in a cellar in the
Mission.
Curtin has been arrested several- times
before on charges of receiving stolen
property, but has generally got off with
Ilgrht sentences. He is a graduate of the
Whlttler Reform School.

DANIELS SLAYER
BOUGHT WEAPON
Mrs., Coarum Purchases
Pistol on Night of
Shooting.
Officers Rodiger and Ward
.* v > Describe Scene at the *
.House.
The trial of Mrs. Catherine. Coarum lor
the murder of Charles Daniels â  was re
sumed In Judge Dunne's court yesterday.
The woman killed Daniels on the night of
April 9 last at 113% Clay street.
Mrs. Coarum was in court, but seemed
devoid ot any Interest In tho proceedings.
She kept her eyes on her attorney, .Rob
ert Ash, occasionally shifting her glance
to Assistant District Attorney Graney,
who is conducting the prosecution.
The first witness called tor - the jirosa
cutlon yesterday was Patrick Clancy, the
watchman who, a short time ago, shot
and killed J. N. E. Wilson. He said that
on the night of the shooting he saw the
accused woman leave her house about 11
o'clock. He said she was gone about fif
teen minutes and that when* she returned
she entered the house by the basement.
Dr. L. V. Bacigalupi, autopsy surgeon
at the Morgue, was next called. His tes
timony was a description of the wounds
which ended the life of Daniels. One of
the wounds, said Dr. Bacigalupi, entered
Daniels' right tmgh and came out on the
inner side of tho limb. Either one of the
other two bullets would have caused
death, said the physician. One entered
Daniels' right snouider, passing between
the third and fourth ribs, and then
through the upper lobes of both lungs,
lodging against the third rib on the left
side. This bullet perforated the aorta.
The third bu.iet entered the victim's back
on the left side, on a level with the ninth
rib, perforated the base of the left lung
and lodged In the cavity of the right ven
tricle of the heart. ;
Heard Prisoner Confess.
Mrs. Louisa Maurer of 1133 Clay street,
a neighbor of Mrs. Coarum, testified that
she was with the policeman who, the day
after the tragedy, forced his way into
Mrs. Coarum's house. The witness said
that as they entered the prisoner's house
they heard her say:
"Yes. I killed himV I killed him! He Â».s
dead down there In the cellar."
Samuel L. Lipman, a pawnbroker, testi
fied that on the night of the shooting he
sold Mrs. Coarum a revolver. He Identi
fied the weapon with which the woman
did the shooting as the pistol she procur
ed at his place. - . â 
John Rolide, a grocer at the corner of
Clay and Taylor streets, testified that he
sold Daniels beer and whisky - at 10:30
o'clock on the night he was killed. â 
Policeman O. H. Rodiger, who arrested
Mrs. Coarum, testified as follows: "I was
summoned to the house of Mrs. Coarum
at 8:35 a. m., April 10. Policeman J. E.
Ward was with me. We tried to get into
the house, but could not, so we -went
next door to Mrs. Maurer' s. From the
kitchen of her house we could see into
Mrs. Coarum's kitchen. We saw the wo
man sitting there at a table on which
there were several bottles and glasses.
We called to her, but she did not answer.
We then searched the house for a means
of entrance. We finally found a window
open and crawled through. When she
saw us cominff she rose from her seat
and walked toward us. She raised her
hands and said: 'I shot him. He Is dead
down cellar." I
"Ward and myself then went down
stairs and found the body of Daniels
propped up in a sitting position against
a bulkhead. He had no coat nor cap on.
Police Find Revolver.
"We then went upstairs, and as we
picked up a five-chambered 38-callber re
volver from the kitchen table Mrs. Coar
um said:
" "There is the plstdl I killed him with.
His coat and cap are hanging on the
hook.' â¢
"There were four discharged cartridges
in the pistol and a. loaded cartridge - was
lying alongside the weapon on the table.
"We found the coat had two bullet holes
in it. We searched the house, but could
not â¢find -a trace, of the other bullets. A
few days ago I went to the house and
found a bullet hole in the steps and a
bullet underneath the steps. 1 ,'
Policeman J. E. Ward corrdborated Rod-
Iger's testimony. He said he took the
woman to the Hall of Justice, and that
on the way there she said she did not
n.f an to kill Daniels. - . . . â  -
"She said," continued Ward, "that she
expected her husband home and had told
the watchman to keep away from the
house. She told me that Daniels had
threatened to kill her and her. husband.
She also said that Daniels came to the
house that night and forced his way in."
Both the officers testified that the house
showed no sign of- any struggle and that
the woman's clothing was not disarranged
in, any way. . They testified that they
found blood stains in the kitchen and on
the steps leading to the basement.
George Pottier, who was Daniels' land
lord at 421 Powell street, testified that the
defendant visited the rooms of the watch
man three or four times a week while he
was rooming there.
The case was then continued until this
morning.
WESTERN UNION BOYS '
WALK OUT ON STRIKE
Three -Messengers Are Discharged
and Others Resign Out of
Sympathy.
There was a strike among the messen
ger boys employed at the main office of
the Western Union telegraph office on
Montgomery street yesterday. The com
pany worked yesterday with only half its
staff of boys. An official stated last
evening that if they could not secure
enough boys to-day to nil the vacant
places they would employ men tem
porarily. .
Delivery Clerk J. Regan says that the
trouble is all owing to three messengers,
who are a disturbing element. He says
that these three boys have been making
too much money. Two of them showed
up for work Sunday under the influence
of liquor. â¢ They were â  promptly dis
charged. These boys used their influence
and twelve others resigned. The locked
out boys attempted to force the rest of
the boys to quit, but their efforts were
unsuccessful. . â¢
The strikers succeeded in inducing four
of. the. boys, who are employed on tha
night shift to quit their positions last
night. For a' time this desertion of the
night shift seriously embarrassed the ser
vice. The clerks in the office, however
were Dressed Into use as Mercuries and
succeeded in disposing of all the mes
sages. The management of the Western
Union Company confidently asserts that
boys, or if necessary men. will be secured
to-day to fill the places of the strikers.
Sailor Badly Battered.
When Oscar Smith, a sailor, appeared
before Judge â¢ Conlan yesterday on a
charge of battery with his head swathed
In bandages he was anxious to know how
the other man looked. It appears that
Smith had been boarding with Mrs. Felix
Wyttebrod, on â¢ Mission street, between
Twenty- fourth and Twenty-fifth streets
during the strike and owed her $50. He
went there Sunday, and when she asked
him for the money he struck her. Sh a
complained to Special Officer J. H. Swift'
who attempted to place Smith under ar
rest. Smith made a motion to draw his
sheath knife, and Swift used his club on
his head. A - charge of disturbing the
peace against Smith was dismissed. The
battery, charge was continued.
Colored Soldier. Steals.
Detective Thomas J. Coleman arrested
Edwin L. Knowles, a discharged colored
soldier, yesterday for stealing, a' check for
$145 from Edward W. Davis, a white sol
dier, and a check of smaller amount from
B y.f5 ett ,Â£- Prince, also a discharged
white soldier. The checks were stolen at

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALli, TUESDAY^ DECEMBER 10, 1901.
NEW LINE AND SHORT
TIME TO SANTA ROSA
Southern Pacific Company Surveyors in the Field Locating Di
rect Route Paralleling the Northwestern, Which Will Con
nect With Speedy Ferry Transit. From McN ears Landing
PROPOSED " DIRECT LINE OP SOUTHERN PACIFIC FROM SANTA
ROSA TO THE BAT. EXISTING ROUTE VIA OAKLAND AND VALr
LEJO JUNCTION TO SONOMA VALLEY TOWNS.
THE old route of the Southern Pa
cific around -Robin Hood's barn
from San Francisco to Santa
Rosa is to be supplanted by a new
line, which will materially shorten
the distance and time between the two
cities mentioned. The passenger taking
the present Southern Paciflc rou.te from
this city to Santa Rosa gets on the ferry
boat at the foot of Market street, crosses
the bay, boards the train at the Oakland
mole and rides to Vallejo Junction. At
the station last named he leaves the
train, boards another ferry-boat and
crosses the bay or Straits of Carqulnez to
South Vallejo, where the Santa- Rosa- train
is in waiting. This train, however, goes
up to Napa Junction, on the main line,
thence across . the branch road from the
junction to Santa Rosa. The distance by
the roundabout tray from San Francisco
to Santa Rosa Is seventy-five miles. The
time consumed in making the run is three
hours and. twelve minutes. By the Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway route (the
old Donahue line) Santa. Rosa is only
fifty-one miles distant from this city, and
the time used in making the trip is two
hours and thirty-three, minutes.
Will Land Near San Quentin.
The Southern Pacific now proposes to
construct a short line and cut out one fer
ry transfer. Surveyors are in the field es
tablishing a direct line from Santa Rosa
via iPetaluraa to some point on the bay
near San QuWitln or McNears Landing. It
is proposed to make quick transfer of the
passengers from this point by ferry-boat
to this city. In effect the proposed new
route will parallel the California North
western, and probably reduce the time
from San Francisco to Santa Rosa to two
SECRETARY GAGE
PUTS ON BRAKES
Not Ready to Apply the
Coastwise Rule to
Shipping.
The Treasury Department seems to be
very much at sea over the recent deci
sion of the United States Court in the
Philippine cases to the effect that those
islands are a part of the territory of the
United States and that it is therefore a
forfeitable offense for a foreign vessel
to transport merchandise from them, to
any other port in the United States.
Late last week the Secretary of the
Treasury Instructed the Customs Collec
tor at this, port to remit whatever pen
alties might have been " incurred by ;the
Nippon Maru of the Japanese line for
carrying twenty cases of hats from Hong
kong to San Francisco, the hats having,
been conveyed from Hongkong to Manila
by a British vessel. The reason given by the
Secretary of the Treasury for this order
was that the shipment had been made
before the Supreme Court oÂ£ - the - United
States. had rendered its decision.
Yesterday the Secretary of the Treas
ury suddenly put on the brakes by the
following telegraphed order to Collector
Stratton: v
This department has been notified - by . the
Secretary of War that you have held that the
recent decision of the Susremc Court* of the
United States makes It compulsory In order to
obtain through bills of lading with merchan
dise for Manila to conform to coastwise ship
ping rules The department has not authorized
iuch a ruling, and if you have made it you
will hold it in abeyance pending specific in
structions The department has â¢ under consid
eration the bearings of the decision in the
fourteen diamond rings cases upon the coast
wise shipping laws. You will be promptly-ad
vised of its conclusions.
Collector Stratton said yesterday that
he had not made any rulings at all in the
matter and that â  he had simply obeyed
the instructions of the Treasury Depart
ment. !Â«fifÂ«3W

Will Shorten Napa Route.
It is reported that the Southern Paciflc
Is planning to shorten the time and re
move some of the annoyances of travel
between this city and towns of the Napa
Valley. There is talk of putting on a
ferry-boat to ply between Rodeo and
South Vallejo. It is proposed to move the
train aboard the boat and convey the
passengers across without a change of
cars. â¢ Going to Napa by the present line
the traveler must cross the bay to Oak
land, then go by rail to Vallojo Junction
and at the last named' point leave the
cars and take the boat to South Vallejo,
where the Napa Valley train is in wait
ing. It is possible thata route may be
established that will utilize the short line
from Santa Rosa to McNears Landing to
accommodate Napa Valley travel. -
The. country Immediately north of San
Francisco and a little beyond the creeks
and estuaries cf the great bay is famed
for scenic beauty and productive capac
ity. The charms of natural scenery and
the agreeable â¢ climate have always been
appreciated, but the inconvenience of
travel from these regions to San Francis
co have been a drawback to the develop
ment of the country. .
The proposed new route of the South
ern Pacific from Santa Rosa to this city
will be at least twenty- four miles shorter
than the existing line around by Vallejo
and Napa Junction, as the California
Northwestern line, which is to be paral
leled,, is not as long by twenty-four miles
as the Southern Pacific's present route.
STARTS IN LIFE
AS A POOR BOY
Now Cannot Count Vast
.. Wealth He Has Ac
cumulated.
i . . . .
Ex-Congressman Charles D. Halnes of
New York State, who is' touring the coast
for his health, arrived at the" Palace yes
terday, accompanied by his wife. He is a
most distinct ligure in politics and prides
himself on being the only Democrat ever
elected from the Nineteenth district of
New York. He served in the Fifty-third
session of Congress and presented the
famous "collar and cult" petition, which
was signed by 40,000 workingmen of Troy,
N. Y., who wished to see the tariff remain
unchanged.
Ex-Congressman Haines started out for
himself when a boy of 14 as a telegraph
operator. At the age of 17 he was nresi
dent of a small railroad. To-day he owns
several small railroads In New York State
and is sole owner of eleven street car
systems. He is the owner of a kaolin mine
in the Southern* States that Js worth a
small fortune, controls one of the
largest lumber combinations in this coun
try, and also prides himself on being the
employer of 11,000 men.
He is only 44 years of age, yet, he admits
that. he does not know how much money
he is worth. But the struggle to amass

BARN FURNISHES
FAMILY SHELTER
Parents and Little Ones
Suffer Prom Cold and
Hunger.
Neighbors Hasten With Food
to Relieve Distress of
â¢ Unfortunates.
. A sad case of destitution was brought
to the attention of the authorities yes
terday and steps were at once taken to
relieve the sufferers. Merritt 8, Hum
phrey, his wife and live children, the
youngest a baby six months old and the
oldest a boy of nine, were found on the
verge of starvation In an old barn on
Balmy street, a small thoroughfare run
ning off Twenty-fourth street, between
Foisom and Harrison.
Tho story of the misfortunes and trials
of. tho unnappy family is a particularly,
sad one. .up to live years ago Humphrey
managed to eke out a liveunood in Uro
gon. 'ininking to better his condition, ho
biurtea ovenana witn his nanny in a
covered wagon, ana after many weeks ot
weary \ travel reacned Los Angeles, "mere
he xound oad jobs at mooring work, but
instead of bettering nls condition ue wad
much worse 'on. Work was not steady.
j.^e was among strangers und everything
he tried his hand at seemed to go against,
him. Disheartened, but not discouraged,
he decided to set out again ana witn us
iumuy in an old, broken down wagon he
Journeyed to Saunas. There he accident
ally broke his leg and his trials began to
increase.
Reach City in Rainstorm. â¢
Before he was hardly able to get off
crutches Humphrey made another start,
this time intent on going back to Ore
gon, where he has relatives, who, al
though almost as poor as himself, would
willingly share their crust with him if
necessary. Tuesday night the family
reached this city In the midst of a terri
ble wind and rain storm. There was no
covering on the wagon and the occupants
were drenched to the skin. To get out of
the storm they wentt into the old barn
and up to -last evening made it their
home. Without a bit of furniture or a
blanket to throw over them they slept on
.the barn floor. A small coal oil stove
furnished them with what heat they had
and that was but little, for the wind
whistled heartlessly through the cracks
in the barn wall and the cold, frosty
night air found its way inside to add to
their misery. â  .
A few vegetables cooked in an old can
on the oil stove and occasionally a loaf of
bread composed their food sunply. Hud
dlfci together in the barn in the daytime
they waited and dreaded the coming of
night. They were also continually haunt
ed by the fear that they might at any
minute be ordered out of the place. Poor
and uncomfortable as It was, the barn
furnished them some slight shelter from
the rain. \ I
> Humphrey would start before daylight
in the hope of finding something to do,
only to return' at night with the sad, dis
couraging- report that he had not met with
success. The poor parents were often
forced to listen to their babies. crying,
both from hunger and cold, and were un
able to aid them. The nursing baby suf
fered most, for the mother was too weak
to furnish it sufficient nourishment.
Neighbors Eegin Work of Belief.
It was not until yesterday afternoon
that the neighbors learned of the presence
of the starving family in their, midst.
When once they heard the facts there
was no time lost in making arrangements
for the temporary relief of the sufferers.
Policemen Brown, McKenna and Lycett
were soon on the scene and they directed
the relief work. A supply of bread, milk
and. cold meat was secured from kind
hearted neighbors and the half famished
children ate voraciously â for many hours
yes, days, had passed since meat had
passed their lips. The poor mother re
fused to touch any of the fdod until the
children were first satisfied and then she
wanted to eat but little. She wanted, she
said, to "save something for the children
after awhile." It was only when she
realized that she must cat to nurse her
baby that she consented to appease her
hunger. In the meantime the neighbors
were hurrying to the barn with contribu
tions of beds, bedding, food and clothing
The policemen stated .the case to L. C
Cull, a real pstate agent on Twenty
fourth street,. and he gave the family the
use of a cottage at the corner of Twenty
fifth and Utah streets. . The policemen
next pressed into service two wagons and
had the donations of bedding and cloth
ing taken to the new home. Another
nel?iibor contributed a stove and at night
fall the unfortunate family was sheltered
and relieved from temporary want.
Officer McMurray of the Humane So
ciety was also notified and to-day he will
look after the further relief of the family.
He says the case is one of the saddest
called to his attention in many months.

THE PROBLEM. \
C^^OROTHY in the nursery can calculate the
gfeSSSr price of Ivory Soap per cake, but it -would
jiglll take a mathematical genius to calculate its
IMSM-Jtrue value. For he must take account of
time, labor, and materials. He must deduct fronvtfce -*
apparent cost the saving in the longer life of the cake,
in the longer life of the washed fabric, in the labor
required, in the time consumed, in the strength ex-
pended, in the results obtained. When all is finished,
Ivory is the cheapest soap in the world. It floats.
SAYS HE TOOK
NOTE TO SMITH
Arthur Wilson Testifies
in Kershow "Will Con- .
test Case.
Arthur L. Wilson, a messenger boy em
ployed by the California Special Messen
ger Company, pointed out J. Morgan
Smith yesterday as the man to whom he
delivered a note at the apartments of
Max Kershow at Tortoni's on the morn
ing of April 6, 1901, the morning on which
the disputed will was signed.
Wilson said he went to the rooms In.
response to a call at 10 a. m. on April 6.
He said the man whom he afterward
identified as Smith came to the door "in
a bath robe and a black eye," and that
after waiting for a few minutes he was
given a . letter to deliver at the ofHce of
A. B. Forbes & Son, insurance agents at
the corner of California and Montgomery
streets. Wilson said he delivered the let
ter and returned to the restaurant, and
gave the answer, which was contained in
an envelope, to the same man who sent
him.
Wilson said he saw no one in the rooms
but Smith and a colored woman, Alice
Kennedy. He said also that he went into
the bedroom and dining-room, and that
there was no one in trie apartments but
the two persons he named.- . -
A. W. - Forbes was . then placed on the
s=tand. He said that he remembered the
messenger boy coming- to his office with
a written request for a check for money
due. J. Morgan Smith. , Forbes says he
gave the boy the check, but that he had
no idea where Smith was at the time.
A. J. Meadows, the second subscribing
witness to the purported will of Max Kcr
show, told practically the same story as
Smith and was not shaken in his testi
mony by the severe cross-examination he
was subjected to by Attorney Rlx for the
contestants. He described in detail the
means Smith had taken on April 5 to in
form . him that Kershow wanted him to
come up to his rooms on a matter of im
portance, and told how the next morning
he visited Tortoni's and signed the will as
a witness. He said Kershow told him
that the matter must be kept strictly
secret, as he was afraid his folks would
hear of it and prevent him from doing
what he wanted.
Attorney Rlx endeavored to show dur
ing the cross-examination that Meadows
spent a great deal of his time in jail, but
his questions were stricken out by the
court. The case will go on to-day at ' H
a. m.
