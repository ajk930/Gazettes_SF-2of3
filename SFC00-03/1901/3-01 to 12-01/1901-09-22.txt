The navy of the United States is not
able for the fact that, according to ex
isting law, there Is no promotion from th*
ranka to an officer's commission. In th*
army many promotions from the ranks
take place every year, but no one can be
come a commissioned officer in the line
of the navy without graduating from An
napolis. True, there are still a few of^"
fleers in the service who were transferred
from the volunteer to the regular estab

as enlisted men, but . as officersâ they

Farenholfs. life has. been unlQua. Its
volumes are summed u; In ttis cca &)â¢>â¢
juent sentence:
"from seaman to fear admiral."'
While' ReaY Admiral Ammen wai duet
of tr-e Bureau of Navigation durinr thÂ«
'70s. Farenholt- received some fairly sood
details, but. as a general thins the berthÂ»
he had drawn were undesirable. Ha
was not always wantod as a shlpmaU by
Annapolis-bred officers, for,' aside from
the prejudice against forecastle exper
ience; hl3 foreign accent was very marked,
his education was below the Naval Acad
emy standard and his manners werÂ» alow
In acquiring the polish desired. Many of
ficers, too, thought of numbers of enlisted
men cf their own acquaintance whoaa
heroisms had Mjeen Quite as great If not
greater than Farenholfs and their othe*
qualifications for a commission, better.
Hence Farnholt's persona! friends In the
navy have . been comparatively few. *?tÂ«
ships have usually been storeshlps or
something' of the kind, which do not offer
ell the enjoyments or advantages of the
regular cruises. Farenholfs rather limit
ed acquaintance at first with ordnance
and other .technical subjects also mili
tated to some extent against bis assign*
merit to ships where he would ba called
upon to act as an Instructor to others.
His firit duty after the war was on" the
Email nronltor Shawnee and then at the>
Boston navy- yard. In 1S66 he was ordered
to the storeship Purveyor and In tho one
1SG7 to the _ receiving ships New
Hampshire and Ohio . and the atoreshlp
Idaho. He was bandied about with very
little, ceremony and only on two occa
sions completed a. full cruise in onÂ» vessel.
In 1SG8-70 he served on the Aahuelo t. In
Asiatic water?, and In the latter year wag
attached to the Norfolk navy-yard, fol
lowing in . close order by duty- on the
cruiser Shenandoah, the receiving ship
Relief, the flagship . Minnesota, tho prac
tice ship Supply and In 1S73 back again to
the Norfolk navy-yard. He spent a year
there and then from. 1377 to 1379 was
placed. In charge of the naval clter depot
at Maiden, Mass. He made a full threÂ«
years* cruise In the -"double-enderf' gun
boat-Monocacy In Chinese - water* 'from
1879 to 1SS2. .
Farenholfs naval career since the Civil
War. however. has r.ot always led through
flowery paths. He has ever had to con
tend with a certain prejudice which ex
.'lets in trw navy against officers who are
not graduate* cf Annaj>oli3. This preju
dice hog been particularly marked In his
case owing to the fact that he did not en
ter even the valunteer service as an of

gulf in | the navy between forward and
aft is a vast one, and naval officers wish
It to be kept impassable. The only bridge
they perm!*, and even that reluctantly. Is

There la a brighter side to the carrying trade In and about the City of
Mexico which onl/ those may aea who are early risers. In th.9 morning
hours, when hundreds of Mexicans are hurrying to early mass, fruits,
flowers and vegetables are ppuriner in from prettv outlying 1 village.) and
those nestling among' the foot hills of the mountains girdling the valley. ..
From two directions coma electric freight carsâ furgoneaâ filled with
chattering market folk with their tastefully arranged wares. Some, have
to lay the wreaths of flowers around their fiats and shoulders and let them
swing from their arms to mako room for all- Even the tops of tho fur
gones have their share.
On. certain corners of the streets. In the general markets and f.n thÂ«
flower market, under the shadows of the gray old cathedral, the brown folk
, sell their dainty ware3. Tho frulta and vegetables find their way to ac

The carrying power of a Mexican carjrador is far greater than his lift

of strength, but a large, powerful nerro would not be ablo to carry any,

BT is odd that the nation of all on tho
earth which stands in need of u great
*r population is the' one which puts
the most ob&taclcs in thu way of mar
riage. A while ago a workman Â«.ced 30
wanted to marry a woman aged 35, who
was divorced and an orphan. Armed with
every document bearing on his identity
he could think of. the workman repaired
to the town hall of his district. His cer
tificate of birth was pounced on at once
by a clerk. It was out of date,- a recent
law requiring that all such documents to
be valid must have been delivered within
the" previous threo months. To obtain a
fresh ' certificate the workman had to
write to the villa g& where * he wail , born.
The delay was fatal." While he: was wait

pointed out to him that ho was Just a

He possessed his soul m such patience
as he v.ivj able, did as he was bid and re
appeared, before the registrar with hU
batch of newly delivered and attested
"papiers."
Then he was asked to produce a copy
of the sentence pronounced by the divorce

that it was necessary. However, he was
rather comf :-rted on hearing that nothing:
was easier than to procure it. ar.d he hur

The, lounge Is a favorlta piece of furni

household,, always in the parlor. If tho
Indians havo a piano or organ It goes into
the' bedroom. The young buck's best sad^

houses it is hung upon the .wall. Red rib
bons are tied, to everything, even the tall

complete "without a cat and a dog.
,- FOw books are found in the houses, but
newspapers and' magazines are common.
One may spend 1 a week in an Indian home
and every day he will pet the news of the
outside world by the daily paper Just the
same ' as at his home in \ the East. " The

As the ComAnches and their neighbors
the Kiowas'were great hunters they have
the most elk teeth, and buffalo hides;
hence in Indian circles the women of these
two tribes are Bupposed to be the best
dressed.
Not until last Easter did. the squaws
introduce the wearing of hata, but they
spent money freely for headpieces when
they once began. They* all had; their hats
trimmed with red roses and: violets. Some
of- the hats were as large -as a bushel
basket. The fashions they follow 1 are
very amusing to the '.white people, but
with them It !Â¦ a lerlutu builncni, nnd

Civilization Is steadily growing with
these people, N and the ways of the whites
bIiow in many, matters besides those of
dfesstjj Most of the young married couples
of the Kiowa'and Comanche tribes have
comfortable houses instead ; of 1 tepees.
They are well, educated, -having been
forced to attend the, Government, schools.
To those new manners of life the young
men and women take kindly,' but the old
er class will have none of them. They
continue to live in tents, as do full-bloods
of other Southwest tribes.

,to credit, this i. newspaper training with a share of whatever success they
have won in the field of fiction. Mr. Williams during the past nine years
has served in various -editorial capacities. on Eastern newspapers,. and
much of what went into "J. Devlin'- was drawn from his experiences and
observations- then. He is a son of Francis Howard Williams of the Au

I Pennsylvania,' where he played football and rowed on the crew. His short
stories have dealt largely with tho workers ! in the, big steel mills and
. with politics." It. was an incident which he witnessed one day in' the
I home of the local; "boss" that gave him" the idea of ': his novel. "J. Dev

there wasa g'ood story in the life of a figure which is so intensely Amor â¢

. "How They Succeeded," by Orison Swett
Marden, is the life stories of successful
men told by themselves. This is certainly
a unique and original .method of recording
chronicles of success. :.Dr. Marden. in this
book has set down the story of successful
men and women told by themselves, either
". In a series of interviews or . by . se'ml
autoblographical sketches. This plan gives
to the book an even greatfer authenticity
and interest than'if the career of the char-,
acters selected were recorded by- another
hand. The interviews were, secured '. for
Dr. Marden's magazine Success, and many
of them were the onlyinterviewsthus'ac
corded. Combined as they have been in
this bock, they make", a', most entertaining
and inspiring series of life stories, full of
incentive to ambitious youth and of inter
est to older persons. The book is a re
markable record of success, achieved in
spite of obstacles and circumstances, and
"shows that honesty of purpose,' strength,
of will and- native" ability are. sure to win
at last. The life stories ihere told are
those of Marshall ';', Field, Alexander
Graham Bell, Helen Gould, Philip ;D. Ar

How They Succeeded.
In "Pauline" Mrs.' G. R. Alden
("Pansy"), has attempted a seri.ou3 study
of complications which, arising In mis
information, or rather in Insufficient in
formation, lead to the flight of a high
spirited young wife from her husband,
and to all the distress and difficulties of
baffled , search/, struggle with experience,
and the sad regrets and self accusations
of sundered lives. Mrs. Alden treats the
story she has told with cleverness and
conscientiousness, believing that all
problems and .troubles are ; solved by
faith H and- she weaves into 1 a romance
that in other; hands might easily drop
Into; the sensational that 'strong thread
of personal' religion' and â¢ helpful charity
that strengthens^ the suffering soul, and
leads, as in this story, the most compli
cated path to peace and reunion at last.
Her story is most interesting. Her reci
tal of it is in this gifted writer's most
approved " style. The book iss well - illus
trated by 'Elizabeth Shlppen Green.

ministered to his father on the scaffold.
You know that he has a hopeless task
before you and you sigh a sigh of relief
The historical novel is not in a? h'gh
favor as it was a year ago. but that is be
cause so. many \or>r ores have been thrust
upon us. If you enjoy a good one -get
"Lazarre" and lead it. It is worth while.
Mary Hartwell Catherwood has done
her best in this book, for the very good
reason that ?he has put her heart' and
s-cul in the work. It is a story that she
has had -in ber mlr.d for year?., and shÂ«
has planned and read on her subject until
to her the characters have become living
persons.
When Fhe vras a little girl she read an
article en "Have We a DauphSn?" where
in the author was positive In his belief
that the young son of Louis XVI did not
die in prison, but vras sent to America.'
The v.-riter succeeded at least In convinc
ing his young reader that this was really
the case, and frorn that day until "La
zarre" was finished the possible romance
of the young Dauphin haunted the brain
of Mrs. Catherwood. . :
Even to this day no cne can say posi
tively that Eleazar Williams and the
young Dauphin were not one and the
same person, so we might as well take
Mrs. Catherwood's story for gospel truth
as anything else. The romance that she
wpaves. around -Lazarrc's life is such a
pleasing one that^n^ "almost wishes it
could be true.
It is known that Williams himself was
sincere in his belief that he was the heir
to the French throne, and. further, that
he was a man of refinement, culture and
education. History says that the Prince
de JoinvIIle visited him. and Williams
pays in his di?ry that the Prince asked
him to relinquish his claims to the throne.
In any event, be the history as it may,
Mrs. Catherv.-ood's romance makes, capi
tal reading, and that is what most con
cerns the readers of fiction.
"Lazarre" is naturally a story of many
disappointments for the hero, but in the
end. though Mrs. Catherwood cannot give
him the throne of France, still she re
quites him with that which, to Americans
at least, seems greater yet. She gives him
the opportunity of taking the throne if he
wishes â that much she can do without up
patting the history of nationsâ but his own
choice will be found much more to the
taste of the reader.
There is no lacK of incident in "La
zarre," and through it all runs as pretty
a love story as cne could wish to read.
We tneet the Dauphin in England on his
Â¦way from the French prison to America.
He is only a little boy at this time, and
made almost idiotic from his hard experi
ences in the dungeon of Paris. We see
him here just long enough to have him
recognized by the members of an exiled
royalist family and then he is spirited
Eway to the wilds of America.
Next we see him when the tirst dawn of
consciousness has broken. He has been
out swimming with his Indian compan
ion, has dived into the limpid lake with
euch vigor of youth that he has struck
his head on a rock and knows nothing
more until hs finds himself an invalid in
the house of the Count de Chaumont. '
This blow on the head is the climax In
the life of the boy imbecile. It is the
knock that he needed to send his revivi
fied senses into the right channel. The
life In the woods since his abductor from
Paris first put him in the hands of an
Indian chief for adoption has made of
him a healthy animal that needed but
this blow to set the wheels of mentality
Into motion and bring the warped mind
back to the normal.
From that time on, with a few lapsed
of unconsciousness, this Indian foster
child grows back to his white estate. He
picks up a thread here and there that re
freshes his memory by degrees to the
truth of his birth and finally nothing will
satisfy him but a trip to Pari3 to find
he knows not what. Napoleon the Great
is at this time in power, and what can a
poor pretender with but the support of a
devoted teacher and an Indian chief, who
Insist upon following him, do against
euch a monument of strength? .
In Paris even he finds among the royal
ists, the old royalists, one at least who
believes in himâ one who saves him from
the morgue of those who are drowned in
the river, eaves him on account of Ins
likeness to his beloved King Louis XVI,
has faith in him and turns over to' him
the jewels of the royal family which he
had secreted at the time of the sacking
Of the palace. This worthy man doe3 all
that he can to help Lazarre, and had he
lived might have given the history of
France a different turn.
Mrs. Catherwood handles the young
Dauphins life in France most skillfully.
She works the Interest of the reader up
to the highe&t pitch and yet so cleverly
keeps within the bounds of history, that
while you read you sa>v "How dramatic
and yet how plausible!" * Â¦

W. O. Stoddard is so well known as
a writer of . boys' stories that, his many
young friends will be glad to know' that
he has written another stirring tale,
'both. instructive and entertaining, for
them. .There is a wave of interest over
us for. 'historical fiction and Mr. Stod
dard's, new; tale fits well in with this de
mand.. It has been the custom to dis
parage our second j war with England,
giving all glory to our fighters on -the
sea an4 but little to our soldiers on
land. In some respects it may have been
aÂ» leaderless war; but,, as the events are
Â¦ studied at' this distance, "the land actions
-as well as those,' on water art; standing
out " more clearly [ and receiving more of
1 the justice they deserve. In this new
view of'the war of 1812 Mr. Btoddard's
story, is something more tfian a mere
t tale of adventure and action written for
younpr people. It is a conscientious and
most interesting study of the operations
on the Ohio border and on Lake Erie,
which resulted in General Harrison's
masterly defense of the frontier, culmin
ating in the battle of the Thames and in
Perry's glorious victory of Lake Erie." - Of
course against ' ' this , background Mr 4
Stoddard has thrown a capital story.
Jack Morgan, a sturdy boy of the fron
tier, is a fine lad, and his adventures will
stir the bloo<i .'of , all, young Americans;
while the varied life, of the border, with
Indians, scouts, frontiersmen, ' British

which to him has proved so kind a moth
er. He does not do this, however, until
he has made a gallant fight- which loses
nothing in the able telling of the author.
One might imagine that after his-re
turn to America the story would be.
over, but the best part is yet to come.
He takes sides with his foster country
against the British and would seem.-.liere
to sink into oblivion as far as his inherit
ed rank is concerned but the chain of
events brings film, back to parts of his
old life. He has been hopelessly In love
with the daughter of an exiled royalist
family of high rank. Mrs. Catherwood
develops this side, of her story very
strongly now, and it will -be easy J for
American readers to decide -at once that
Lazarre's success here is of more impor
tance than the throne of France. '

"Gulliver's Travels," â¢ by" Dean Swift,

a, traveler meets pigmies so small that
his middle finger can measure them, and
giants so' large that'he can find "refuge

at the amusing results of 4 these unusual
adventures. They marvel perhaps at the
accuracy of the ' author's measurements.
Arid reveling, laughing . and marveling
as children, they are not concerned with
the terrible satire Â¦ hidden-,' between : the
lines. The irony and the sting which first
caused the book to be written \ were di

passed by, leaving to the book its gentler

Mention has already been made of tha
resurrection of "Sherlock Holmes" by Dr.
Conan Doyle, writes James Walter Smith
from London to the September Literary
Era, Messrs.. Newnes managed to Induce
Dr. Doyle to revive his first and greatest
hero, and the publication of the new de
tective story has begun in the Strand
Magazine. A well-known American pub
lishing firm , offered a huge sum for tha
right to publish this story serially In
America, but Messrs. Newnes preferred to
run it in the American edition of tha
Strand. What success thl3 venture of
Doyle's will have remains to be seen, but
it is not improbable ' that .""Sherlock
Holmes" will be one of the successes of
the autumn publishing season. William
Gillette will open in September at the
Lyceum Theater with hia dramatization
of "Sherlock Holmes," and if the success
of that play In America is repeated here
it will give a valuable fillip to the sales
of the new bock in London. The pretty
point in literary ethics which has been
raised by. the resurrection of the dead
hero of fictionâ although Dr.. Doyle has
cleverly avoideJ the direct charge of rais
ing Sherlock from the deadâ would better
be left for discussion among those who
are less busy than we.

and plays a stronger game than any other
lady ; on the Pacific Coast, probably not
even excepting Mrs. Jean. W. Bowers, who
is the woman champion of Southern Cali

girls and young -matrons who really. do
( seem to'take more â¢ genuine pleasure in
trudging round a; links than in traversing
a bal'toomâ who prefer golf to gossip and
broad 8cotch\*.o scandal. .
THE "society cirl" Is no longer with
us. She ha? been relegated to the
I past. It is now the smart athletic
I young womanâ the young woman of
JL to-day who shoots, rides, swims,
goes boating and yachting and plays golf
and tennis. The pink and white flowers of
the ballroom have evoluted Into this.
Where In the old days the maiden fair'
donned her sunbonnet and gloves she now
tears them oft, rolls up her sleeves to dis
play a correctly sunburned arm and turns
her collar down to show an equally sun
burned neck.
She is to be Been every day on the
beaches of California, romping in the
breakers: or in the mountains, swinging
a_team along at a lively clip. She tramps
with the hounds after the deer over the
ridres. or casts a fly into the shady pool
as well, and often a little better, than her
brothers. And as for tennis and golfâ she
plays them like a man. What more could
be eaid? ,':;Â¦Â¦'
San Francisco is especially well favored
In location for her fair daughters who
love the outdoor life afleld and afloat. In
an hour's time you can be on tne high
seas or in the wilderness if you wi.Â«. ' .
Mies Alice Hoffman spends much of her
time during the deer season hunting in
Liberty Canyon, in Marin County. She
rents the shooting and has a shooting box
up la that part oÂ£ the country. It is a
common occurrence to see hrr drlvo a
smart little unicorn, or four-in-hand team",
at a ripping pace between San Rafael and
Liberty8. She also Â¦ occasionally brings
them over the ridge down to Bollnas.
She is quite a whip as well as a crack
shot.
Miss Marln "Waterhouse of Bolinas ia
also an ardent Dtana. She prefers the
quail or snipe shooting to the deer hunt
ing about Bolinas. as she gets better deer
stalking at her father's ranch in;Napa
County than at Bollnus. where he also
has an extensive property.
Miss "Waterhou.se is not afraid to hunt
the wildcats which do damage very often
to young animals up the coast' near Point
Reyes. She and her, father .: organized
quite a hunt during her last visit to Bo
linas. As she is completing her education
at MIes Head's School at Berkeley, she
cannot, of course, until after her debut
have as much shooting as she would Ilka.
Miss Crosby of San Rafael ls another
young lady said to be a good shot. She
is often uÂ» at Llbcrtys with Miss Hoff
man.
. Many well-known society girls often run
over for a few days', sport. The shooting
is splendid, as the properties are nearly
all large and preserved, and the Country
Club is within easy driving distance.
Several well-known society women have
summer cottaees at Bolina3 Beach, as
Mrs. Hepburn Wilkins- and Mrs. Parks
also Mrs. Vincent Ncalc of San Rafael'
Moiitw cup. ; Mrs.' Thrown. . besides club
prizes galore, has won the ladies' cups of
the San * rancisco and San Rafael Golf
clubs, and last month captured the Ponia
towski'cup at Burlingame. Mrs. Brown
golfs not only bare-armed, but bareheaded
as well, and it is a pleasure to see the en
thusiasm, to say nothing of the accuracy
and good judgment, with which she plays.
Another well-known golfer 1b Miss Alice
Hager, who up to the time of her recent
departure on a trip to the Orient was onÂ©
of the most regular morninfr visitors to
the Presidio links. She is a strong, vig
orous girl and often drives 8. longer ball
than Mrs. Brown. She worked her way
up into the final round of the woman's
championship at Del Monte.' being. beaten
only by the winner. Miss Caro Crockett.
A year, or two ago, before her marriage,
there was no'iocal golfer better known
than Miss Alice Momtt of the- Oakland
Golf Club. now. Mrs. George Doubleday of
New York. She won the ladies' trophy or
.the Oakland Golf Club,- and hers is the
first name inscribed on the . Ponlatowskl
"cup. The second name is that of Miss
Caro Crockett, who Is a familiar figure on
the . links of ' San . Francisco , Del Monte
and the Burlingame Country Club. '. .
Miss Crockett playa an accurate gama
and never allows any mishaps occurring
either to her opponent or herself, to dis
turb . her* equanimity. Her careless de
meanor is apt to deceive hÂ«r adversary
but she never allows her own Judgment
to be clouded or her good i;emper to be
ruffled. For these reasons, as well as for
her good play, sUe Is a dangerous oo
ponent In a match game.
Among other San Francisco girls who
are fond of golf may be mentioned Miss
FlorenceJves, Miss Maud "Hulling, Miss
Minnie Houghton. Miss Ella "W.- Morgan
Miss Therese Morgan, - Mlssi Alice Moff-

6SOME POPULAR SONGS THAT BROUGHT RICHES TO THEIR COMPOSERS.
Â«|7vP N American was talking with a mu-
If \ sic publisher in London recently of
jf~^ the immense sums a few of . our
song writers have received for their
â¢wares, believing â¢ that they were excep
tional cases. The Englishman speedily, un
deceived him. \ â¢ Â¦,
"Why." he said, "I could name offhand
a dozen songs that have yielded a profit
of Â£10,000 ($50,000) â¢ each and over and the
value of the copyright of which is to-day
reckoned in the thousands/-, . ' -
"Take, for â¢ instance, Mascheroni's ex
quisite ballad. 'For All Eternity.' I should
not like to say what- weight of gold that
song has yielded, but not very lone ago
the copyright in it was considered to be
worth Â£2240, a sum for which it was sold
by. Messrs. Puttick & Simpson, the.auc
tioneers. And yet I believe- that .very sons
was offered to a London publisher for a
Â£10 "note and refused- by him.:. Think Tof.
refusing a thousand sovereigns for. every
one laid down! ,- ' "Â¦Â¦ .;. ,
"But then, of. course, one must remem
ber the risk we publishers run. It is a fact
that, of every hundred songs offered to
me barely one is-worth the.cost of print-
Ing and publishing;; and a song that will
yield a few /hundreds of profit is' literally
one in a thousand. .- :,--Â¦ *Â¦-Â¦ â¢ [ Â¦-Â¦... ;-..
"Among songs that have produced more
than Â£10,C00 in pro 'it I should place firat
Sullivan's .world famous 'Lost Chord.'
This song was ' substantially composed in
less than an hour, and for that, Â¦Â¦â¢ hour's
work â¢ the composer received tin. royalties
quite Â£10,000â probably, the largest â¢Â¦sum
any man has ever earned 'in an hour "by
his '.brain.'.' ,-; â¢ Â°\ ,
"Then, â¢ again, that ever ~ green song,
'In Old- Madrid,'" must have brought-it3
publisher a profit of nearly Â£20,000 by. this
time, for. its popularity was at the flood
for many years. â¢ ' ; . .* , â¢ ; : ..
- "Among 1 other goldmines I should place
'The' Better-Land,'.; 'The River of Years,'
'Forever and' Forever," Â¦'Goodby,'.. The De
vout, Lover,' 'Nancy 'Lee'â to mention only,
half a dozen, the aggregate profits from
which cannot have been a penny less than
Â£60,000. .-Â¦/Â¦- Â¦" ->â¢Â¦ ! .: â¢â¢
."Among more recent favorites, which,
however,- Â¦ are", far from: supplanting, the
older ones, such songs as -.'The River -of
Life,' 'The.Flight of Ages' and 'Beauty's
Eyes', promise to be quiteias rich harvest
bringers to! composers and publishers.
- "Of course, if a song' has anything-in
it, it is a fatal thing to 'sell it outright
to a publisher, as, so many , composes
have Â¦ done, to their lasting â¢ regret.
. ; "It is : an old . story that 'Kathleen Ma
vourneen," which never ; seems to lose its
charm : for !. the- public,' was sold for five
pounds sterling. I scarcely.' dare: specu
late how. much the / unhappy , composer
must have lost by this bargain. Some of
Mr. Milton Welling's. best. songs changed
hands for . absurd .prices. -the" composer
scarcely receiving a pound for every thou
sand made by t his publishers. . Â¦Â¦ ,
':'Â¦ "Fancy being the possessor of such a
song as 'Some Day' for a ten-pound note,
and making- as many- thousands by It!
Alas! Such chances never come ; my way.
â¢" 'Nancy Lee" was at one time on offer
for, ten pound and refused; although for
some years Mr.' MaybrJck's profits from
this one song averaged over Â£1500 a year.

Her attire suggests that she Is dying

ever dream of telling her that black was
white, for she looks absolutely capable or"

To be strictly up to date, the old bare
should begin his epic with a slight revi
sion of the catchy first line:
"Arms and the woman I sing."
That would be much more likely to com
pete in the whimsical market of to-day

popular Kipling.
The bare-arm girl has followed the bare
arm chap Just as she has followed him
in everything else. She is an evolution
from what she was to what she isâ slow
but sure, like the development of a shape-
Jess mass into anything beautiful and
symmetrical.
When the maiden fair decided to go In
for athletics she shed her stays, threw
away the eunbonnet, donned a skirt that
suddenly rose from the ground to the
knee and sallied forth in the long-sleeved
shirt waist and high boots as the proper,
thing- to wear In most all kinds of
weather. .
Then came the rage to be at least three
colors darker than one ought to be.
A face and hands painted a dusky
brown became a mark of great distinction.
But even then the girls looked askance
at their brothers* shirts, which were nine
times out of ten sleeveless, or if they
boasted eleeves, were always rolled to
their shoulders when they were working

It worked beautifully.
Cautiously, with considerable mental
agitation, the arm was disrobed inch by

conservative than 'the re3t, cut away thÂ©
whole bothersome thing.
She found that she couldn't be so horri

Society nearly had nervous prostration.
People talked -and talked.'
But when the match went down from
115 to the fifties, a mixed foursome, the
bare-armed girl became the most popular
pardner on the links. She;was simply
unhampered in her movements over the
turf. Her muscle was unrestrained, her
cut terrific and her strokes brought vic
tory not only to the golfer but to the
short sleeve. - .

He studied law until he knew it, so that
none could tangle him in Its meshes, and
then had the good sense to keep out of it.

Mrs. Roosevelt has fought against pub

her ability.' During all the stirring. times
of the reports of San Juan Hill, when

the man who strives stands far above the
man who holds aloof, whether because of

There is in Roosevelt's own words his
unconsciously drawn description of him
self. It Is from the preface to "American
Ideals," and through the rest of the work
one finds here and there interesting opln-
Jons, for they were written four years be
lore the happenings which have placed
him In the White House, and are there
fore valuable as showing what manner of
man he thinks a President should be.
Speaking of the office of Vice President
he says in a chapter in "American Ideals":
"He presides over the Senate and he has
In Washington a position of marked so
cial importance, but his political weight
as Vice President is almost nil. I
"There Is always a chance that he may
become President. As this is only a
chance It seems almost Impossible to per
suade politicians to give it proper weight.
This certainly does not seem right.
"The Vice President should,' so far as
possible, represent the same views and
principles which have secured the nom
ination and election of the President. He
should be a man standing well In the
councils of the party, trusted by his fel
low party leaders and able in the event
of any accident to his chief to take up
the work oi the latter Just where It was
left. - "
"It Trill be a matter of much Importance
to the nation that the next Vice Presi
dent should stand for some settled policy.
"It is an unhealthy thing to have the
Vice President and the President repre
sented by principles so far apart that the
succession of one to the place of the' oth
er means a change as radical as any pos-
Bible party overturn."
With President Roosevelt there goes
Into the White House a typical American
family; a man who is of the people and
human, a wife -who is first, foremost and
above all things a wife and mother, hap
py in devoting her life to a family of
children who look as though they had
stepped out from a canvas by Sir Joshua
Reynolds.
A man Is as many times a man as he
speaks languages, said one who Is a lin
guist. It might better be said that a
man Is as many times a man as he has
occupations. Gauged- In this wav, Theo
dore Roosevelt is a whole community.
He has run the gamut of human oc
cupations as far as the limitations of
time in his comparatively short life have
permitted. He has ridden wild bronchos
on the plains, when running a ranch in
the West. He has pulled mired cows
from the swamp and branded ' young
calves. He has hunted wolves that were
pulling down yearlings on dark nights.
He has gone on month-long bear hunts
to exterminate ' marauders that were
killing his young colts. . He^ has been a
lawyer, a soldier, an official of the navy,
a writer for magazines, a maker of
books, a regulator of municipal politics,
Governor of a State. He has done all
of these things and each of them well as
the best can do them.
He passed through the tenderfoot stage
and bucked up against bad men, he with
his fists, they with their guns and other,
weapons, until they were glad to give him
a wide berth. When he had demonstrated
that & tenderfoot could break horses
faster, lasso steers more surely" and gen
erally get more profit out . of the woolly
West than the men who. had spent their
lives tangled in It, he went back to the
bad, wild East/and there In Mulberry

he showed what cool grit and clean hands
could do In besting rowdy politicians and
their "adherents. He went Into politics

cially when -"egg-rolling" time comet at
Easter and the children of the city of
Washington congregate on the Whit*
House lawns to roll eggs racing down thÂ»
terraces and peck egss to see whose hard

It will be Roosevelt's greatest regret on
coming into power that he will have so
little time to devote to the family that Is
so much to him and to which he means
so much, but there 13 a busy life ahead
of, him. for he has the will to make a suc
cess of every one of the theories which
have been so heartily approved by tha
people.
His remark that "the next Vice Presi
dent should stand for some settled pol
icy" is full of meaning. Roosevelt's pol
icy in office has been "enforce the laws."
There are no dead letter laws left lying
around -where he is enforcing them. HÂ»
believes that it is the duty of an execu
tive tc enforce all laws which apply,
whether good or bad. If bad they should
be repealed, and he says "the best way to
get a bad law repealed Is to enforce It.'*
Â¦There Is one law that he may enforcs

year 1&00 there had been the usual num

ing the latter part of that year a deadly
bomb was thrown under the coach of
Napoleon as he was passing through a
street on his way to the opera. He said,
nothing much at the time. Went to tha
opera. Went home. Saw Fouche. There
after and even long after Fouche left his
office "as Minister of Police he was a busy
man â he and his agents all over Conti

chases apparently without purpose and
many men marked for police capture

-The training is not all done. under sad
dle. In recent years some horses are
given their exercise hitched to a cart.
This takes the weight of a rider off the
horde's legs. 'Some horses. behave, much
better in harness than.' under saddle.
They can be walked, cantered or galloped;
their handlers usually selecting a time
when the track Is clear of other horses.
Much'of the steady jogging is done on the"
road. ' Â¦ . :.
The majority of the exercise boys are
sturdy youngsters ranging in weight from
fifty to eighty pounds. Nothing Is re
quired of them outside the riding they do,
the remainder of the day being their own.
They are all fond of baseball and other
games. In the winter they spend the long
evening at school in their home adjoin
ing the training stable. There is the best
understanding between themselves and
the trainers, no severity nor harsh
language being required to keep them up
to their work. The actions of the horses
show the boys to be thoroughly compe
tent. Jockey J. Ransch is a graduate
from this school. At present he is one of
the stable's head jockeys.
Among the youngsters which will sport
the orange, blue sleeves of Burns &
Waterhouse are youngsters by Altamax.

dal and Figaro. Â¦ They .are out of such
well known mares as Paloma, Picnic.

r. This does not end the cares of the
trainer. Before retiring for the night,
lantern In hand heÂ» visits the stall of
every,horse in his charge. The mangers
are inspected to see that none of the
horses are off their feed. Blankets are
readjusted and the horses made as com
fortable as possible for the night.
In the evening they are quietly walked
about, the yards and are then made, up
for the night. .
When the allotted amount of work has
been done the horses are ridden back to
the grand stand as though at the end of
a race. The exercise boys dismount,
saddles are removed and the horses are
rubbed down. This is merely intended
to quiet them and accustom them to the
track and its surroundings. This rub
bing process continues for ten minutes
and is not intended as a complete toilet
for the embryo racers. When it is com
pleted, the horses are walked down tho
track and past the 'stand and then back
to their stables. Here the grooms take
them in hand in earnest and rub them un
til their coats glisten in the sunlight.
sters is done under the direction of Ben
Timmons, the trainer. He stands on the
track and gives his orders and then sees
them carried out to the letter. If one
of the horses Is off his feed his exercise
may be of the simplest character.

It is probable that the programme of
;he San Francfscos, which in former
years Included half a dozen hops at the
clubhouse, will next year show very few
dances, as they were found a source of
serious expense and to do the club or its

or more to convey guests back to j the
city after the dance, but this expense has

may also eend a crew.
If the Olympic Club succeeds in getting
the ground near Sessions Basin, East
Oakland, for an athletic field, it is certain
that boating will attract much more at
tention among the members than it has
hitherto done. It will then be impossible to
reach the boathouse in forty-five minutes
from the foot cf Market street, and to
return every half hour during the day. It
is not unlikely that the Columbia Rowing
Club, the quarters cf which are on Ses
sions Basin, would combine with- the
Olympic Club. Oaklan-J Creek would then
become the headquarters of oarsmen on
San Francisco Bay, as clubs would feel
certain of remaining undisturbed on the
creek for many years, whereas two of the
city clubs, the Pioneers and the Ariels,
are at present without houses or any im
mediate prospect of securing them. Space
on the city front has become so valuable
for commercial purposes that it is hard
for clubs to find suitable locations -for

them they are not certain of being able to
retain them.

been at work on the Dolphin barge, and
has lightened It so much that It Is now

burner, . lift : off. the netting and scour
thoroughly. Wipe all parts with a dry

WHY MUST BUTTER

- - >'. Â»*"â¢ -that' the bacterial population

"Thus the urgency for keeping these,
hordes in check, and' hence tha efforts
which made first to set up effectual
barriers to their ingress by taking proper
precautions in the production /of milk,
and, secondly, in the conduct of the pro
cesses involved; in 'the manufacture - and
distribution of. the finished 'article. In
cluded In these 1 processes Is the addition
of salt in such quantities as to justify the
butter being known as salt butter, this
addition being made with the object of
extending the keeping powers of the â¢ but
ter, or. In other words, to suppress* to a
large extent the activities' of the butter
bacteria. That salt does act In this man
ner is shown by .thÂ°yf act that in butter
thus /treated a very, large reduction in"
the number of micro-organisms present is
effected. ; There can be little doubt, there

The writer aiso refers to the Invest**
gations of a Russian savant. M. Zakher
bekoff. who carried out an elaborate in
quiry into the bacterial quality of thÂ«
milk supplied to St. Petersburg. The fig
ures he obtained are appalling. Milk de
scribed and supplied as the purest pro
curable was found to contain a minimum
of over 1C.00O.C0O and a maximum of no
less than S3.000.000 of bacteria In from 20
to 25 drops, while in other samples a
.minimum of 2,400,000 and a" maximum of
114,500,000 -were found. How unnecessary
such bajcterial pollution of milk is may bÂ«
gathered from the fact that milk under
normal healthy conditions contains no
bacteria whatever as It issues from thÂ«
cow; that If due precautions of cleanli
ness, etc.. are observed milk may be ob
tained absolutely sterile, or, in other
words, entirely devoid of bacterial Ufa.
Such milk has frequently been procured
from cows in cases where It has been re
quired in its natural state, free from bac
teria, for experimental purposes.â Long*

THERE are certain dishes that the
ordinary housekeeper sets down as
out of her line. She looks upon
them as prcfefs:onal. The imported
chef surrounds them with a mys
tery that she never probes. As a matter
of fact, there are few. if any. of the dishes
served at swagger restaurants that cannot
be fairly reproduced by the. amateur if
she has only the genius of infinite pains.
Frogs' legs are one of theÂ«e. Now that
frogs are raised for market. near by. there
is no reason why we should not be vary
ing the routine of our ov.-n simple tables
by means of a recipe like this.
FROGS* LEGS.
Dip the saddles into fine commeal. then
into beaten ecrg seasoned with pepper, salt
and lemon juice; redip into the meal and
fry in deep, smoking hot fat.
Serve on a folded napkin with pieces of
lemon.
That point of the commeal is a good
one to remember, anyway. Use it with
clams, oysters or cutlets as a change from
cracker crumbs.
Another article that the amateur han
dles gingerly is a planked fish. It's easy
if you know how and own the planking
board.
PLANKED FISH.
Any kind of fjsh can be treated in this
manner; split dojwn the back, after scaling
and removing fins, retaining head and tail.
Remove entrails and wipe inside and out
with a damp cloth, then fasten to a but
tered planking board with large-headed
steel tacks. Set on trivet in dripping pan,
cover with bits cf butter and set in. hot
oven to roast, basting frequently. When
done, dust with salt, sprinkle with lemon
juice and serve on the planking board
placed on platter.
Ancther school of cooking that the
young housekeeper usually steers clear of
is that of the past generation. Pie crust
and biscuits that our mothers tall grand
mothers made had a deliciousness that we
don't dare try to eaual.
There is nothing like taking the bull by
the horns. Here are some, explicit direc
tions for old-fashioned dishes? that ought
to find the well-known way to any man's
heart.
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.
Mix one. of flour, one teaspoonful
salt, two teaspoonfuls baking powder; cut
in two tablespoonfuls butter; when like
meal add one pint 'of milk. Divide into
i thirds, roll oyt and bake in greased pans.
When done, spread with butter and crush
ed strawberries, dust wJth fine sugar and
serve with cream.
When strawberries are out cf season the
shortcake can be varied like .this: -
ORANGE SHORTCAKE.

FRIED CAKES.
One-half cup butter rubbed smooth with
one scant cup sugar, one egg well beaten,
one and a half cups milk, one and a ha!f
pints of flour, two teaspoons baking pow
der, half teaspoon nutmeg. Mix into a
soft dough, roll out about a half inch
thick, cut into circles and fry in smok
ing hot fat. When cold roll in fine sugar.
BAKED BOOK ROLLS.
jOne quart flour, half teaspoon salt, two
teaspoons baking powder, rub in one ta
blespoonful butter, then mix into a smooth
dough with one pint of milk. Knead once
or twice on a. floured board, roll out a
half inch thick. Cut rolls with circular
cutter, fold one half over the other half,
brush with milk, lay on greased tin-and
bake Sfteen minutes in hot oven.
COLESLAW AND SAUSAGE.
A tempting way to serve coleslaw is to
shred it fine, season with pepper, salt and
a little melted butter; arrange on a di*h
with sausage nicely browned. Just be

STUDENTS of human nature declare
that almost all persons are supcr
e'Jticus. The belief In good nnd
b&C vCiens. the construing of trivial
accidents and happenings of the present
Into grave portents of the future Is as old
as recorded hibtory. Such apparently
childieh mental process Is often attributed
t-ontemptuously to peasants or persons of
inferior knowledge or education, but it is
a well known fact that Dr. Johnson, one
of the grave5t. most learned and phil
osophical minds of modern time*, was a
veritable slave of superstition.
Without entering Into the origin and
"history of this peculiar form of belief,
common to many of the greatest men of
antiquity artf the present, It is interesting
and curious to gather eo.me of. its most
popular and current forms in England
and this country.
Old sayings regarding clothes are still
Implicitly believed In by many; as for

particularly stockings, inside out; but if

Another and weird belief regarding per
sonal attire is that the clothes of the dead
will never wear long. When a person dies
and his or her clothes are given away, to
the poor, it is frequently remarked: "Ori,
they may look very well, but they won't
wear; they belong to the dead." *

which the blockade was maintained at
night, could you have seen any vessel at

"I have not."

ever drew after that date a distance of

WASHINGTON. Sept 2L-Only one
new witness was introduced to
day to the naval court which is
-Investigating the conduct of Ad
miral Schley during the Spanish-
American war. This witness was
Commander Seaton Schroeder, who was
executive officer of the battleship Massa
chusetts during the war and is now Gov
ernor of the Island of Guam. His testi
mony dealt with the cruise of the "fly
ingr squadron" from Cienfuegos to San
tiago and the bombardment of the Span
ish ship Cristobal Colon as she lay in the
mouth cf the harbor at Ssjitiago on

â¢was not as expeditious as it shoud have
been. He also said that in the bombard
ment of the Cclon the fleet had not act
ed as deliberately as the commander-in
chief had announced it to be Bis pur
pose to have it act.
"While Commander Schroeder was giv

him make a comparison of the distance
of the fleet from the shore under Ad
miral Sampson after the latter officer
arrived and took command, but the judge

the Question, saying, however, that he
did so only temporarily and that he
would raise the point at a later stage in
the investigation. The forenoon sitting
was devoted mainly to the cross-exam

miral Higginson, the latter having been
recalled. Admiral Higginson corrected
his statement made yesterday .concern
ing the distance from shore maintained
by the fleet during the blockade of San

Loses His Temper When Put on the
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â Admiral
Dewey observed his usual rule of prompt
ness in calling the Schley court of inquiry
to order at 11 o'clock to-day. All the
members of the court were present on
the minute and Admiral Schley sat with
his counsel at the table set apart for
them, on the left of the witness seat. The
attendance of the public was somewhat
larger than on yesterday.
The first witness called was Captain
Harber, executive officer of the Texas
during the Spanish war, who was on the
stand when the court adjourned yester
day.
The Judge advocate asked no question
of him and he was Immediately turned
over to Raynor of counsel for Admiral
Schley, who questioned him concerning
his statement made yesterday to the ef
fect that he did not recall that there was
any picket line established inside the line
of blockade at Cienfuegos. A report by
& hley was read to the effect that a pick
et line had been maintained, but the wit
ness declined to change his statement.
Could Not Recall Signal.
Asked If the Brooklyn had not, on May
24, signaled the Texas to go alongside the
collier and coal, he rsald he did not recall
anything of the kind. Itaynor read tho
flr.nsil message an follows :
"Go alongside the collier and coal as
rapidly as possible" but no amount of
pressing could bring the witness to, say
that he remembered the incident. He had.
he said, very little to do with the signal-
Ing. The same replies practically were
made In rcsponw to questions regarding
other signals. Raynor quoted several of
these. One transmitted from the Texas
to the Brooklyn read, "On afterthought
the captain thinks it unsafe to put a col
lier between battleships." Another from
the Texas read: "Do not think it safe to
collier. The two ships will surely crush
her."
Captain Harber replied that he remem
bered there was some talk of the collier,
but he could not recall what It was.
Speaking of the signals observed off
Cienfuegos, he said his supposition, as
was that of the other officers, was that
they ,were between the Spanish forces.
C*t>taln Harber was also Questioned
closely concerning the rate of speed of the
fleet on the sail from Cienfuegos to Santi
ago on May 25.
Ho said the weather, was fresh and the
sea moderate; that it was hard for small
vessels, but It was "nothing much." He
thought the Texas could have made from
ten to twelve knots. Raynor had the'
witness read logs of the Massachusetts,
the Iowa, the Brooklyn and other vessels
concerning the weather at that time.
Raynor read a report from j Captain Hijf
glnson saying that the weather had been
"rough and squally" on the 35th. Captain
Harber stated that the report of Captain
Higginson was not borne out by the log
book of his ship.
"It does not correspond with the log,"
the witness said, and he added that hav-;
ing given his best recollection concerning
the weather he thought Raynor had an
ulterior motive in his questions. Raynor;
declared that he had no such end in view.'
"Then," said the witness, "I have given
you my best recollection concerning the
weather."
"That is what I want," responded the
attorney. Â»
"That Is what I have given you," re
peated the witness.
Captain T^emly objected to the examina
tion of Captain Harber on the record of
a ship which he had no part In preparing.
Objection Is Sustained.
The court retired to consider the point.'
After an absence of ten minutes the
court returned, announcing its declMon,
sustaining the objection that the witness
could not be examined on the log of the
Massachusetts.
Continuing his testimony. Captain Har
bcr Insisted that the weather on May 25
was not "rough."
He also maintained that it was his
recollection, as stated yesterday, that the
fleet was farther out at night than In
the daytime. When his attention was
called to a contrary statement by. Ad
miral Higginson, the witness said that it
was not material to him what any other
men hadsald; that he had given his es
timate and was not concerned about . tho
statements of others.
"Then you object to having your mem
ory refreshed?" said Raynor. ' . _, '

witness. "I am here to give my test!-!

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.The Spanish ships came out at a speed
of about nine knots, with the steam
bottled up, and rapidly Increased their
velocity when clear of the harbor. Th>*
American ships lay with engines turning
slowly, the Brooklyn with steam for
twelve knots, the Iowa and the others for
five knots. The much discussed topic of
the "loop" made by th& Brooklyn will un
doubtedly be fully explained before the
board, and it suffices to state that the
Brooklyn does not appear to have been
responsible for the fact that the Texas,
Oregon and Iowa got into a bunch In
position No. 2, blanketing the fire of the
Texas and Oregon. The Spanish ships,
being inshore, were taking the longer leg
of the triangle, exposing for several miles
their broadsides to the American ships.
Fifteen minutes after the Teresa came
out the race was fairly started and the
total run in miles and average speed in
knots per hour made by the several ships
from 9:35 a.'m. to 1:15 p. m. is as follows:
Spanish Ships ArÂ« Swift.
At 9:33 a. m. Maria Teresa came out of har

At 10:15 a. m. Teresa, turned to run ashore.
At 10:25 a. m. Oquendo turned to run ashore.

none, but instead ten 6-inch quick-firing,
six 4.7-inch quick firing, ten 6-pounders,
ten 1-pounders and two machine guns.
The other three vessels had also each ten
5.5-incH' quick' firing, 'eight 6-pounders,
eight 3-pounders and four machine guns.
Armament of Americans.
Of the Americans the Brooklyn had
eight 8-inch guns, twelve 5-inch rapid fir
ing, twelve 6-pounders, four 1-pounders
and four machine guns. The Oregon had
four 13-inch guns, eight 8-inch, four 6-inch,
twenty 6-pounders, six 1-pounders and
four .machine guns, and the Indiana the
same. The Iowa had four 12-inch guns
instead of 13-inch, eight 8-Inch, six 4-inch
rapid firing, twenty 6-pounders, six l

Texas had two 12-inch guns, six 6-inch,
twelve 6-pounders, six 1-pounders and four
machine 'guns.
The fire from the Spanish fleet was very
wild and ineffective, as shown by the
slight damage to the American ships and
the extraordinarily few casualties to their
crews. The Colon fired 184 rounds from
her battery of. 5.9-inch gunsand 117 4.7
inch>>shells; the Viscaya delivered 150
rounds of all calibers. What the other
Spanish ships fired during their brief run
is not known, but the damage was only
25 hits on the Brooklyn, 3 on the Oregon,
2 each on the Iowa and Indiana and 1 on
the Texas. The casualties were one

Big Shells From Battleships.
The Oregon fired thirty-six and the In
aiana thirteen- thirteen-inch sheila, only
one of the. forty-nine taking effect, and
that on the Teresa, which also was
struck by the only one of the thirty-nine
twelve-inch shells fired by the Texas
(8) and Iowa (31)."
, T hree hundred and forty-one eight-inch
shells. were fired, 100 from the Brooklyn,"
145 from the Oregon, 35 from the fowa
and 61 from the Indianaâ 341 in all. Of
these three struck the Teresa, eight the
Qquendo and four the Viscaya. The
Americans fired besides 171 six-inch shells,
473 five-Inch (all Brooklyn), 251 four-inch
and 5984 six-poundersâ a total of 7288, of
which 123, or 1.68 per cent i took effect.

NO JEALOUSY
YACHTS READY
FOR THE RACE
France's Reception of the
Czar Considered Un
important.
Columbia and Shamrock
II in Satisfactory
Condition.
BERLIN, Sept. 21.â While the papers
have devoted much space this week to the
reports of the festivities In France on the
occasion of the Czar's visit to that coun
try, the discussions on the subject were
few and showed that Germany is little
concerned thereby. Confidence in the
Czar's peaceful intentions is so strong
here that the French wooing excites no
Jealousy.
The papers, however, take delight In
pointing out that the Czar used the most
measured language in replying to Presi
dent Loubet, whose utterances are here
regarded as an ill-disguised intimation of
France's thirst for revenge on Germany.
All the Czar's utterances are here under
stood as meaning no interference on the
part of Russia in the affairs of other na
tions, respect of tho existing frontiers and
abandonment of all plans of warlike ad
venture on behalf of. France. '
The German papers reproduce with sat
isfaction the utterances of M. de Cassag
nao and other French Chauvinists to tho
effect that the Franco-Russian alliance la
devoid of any practical advantage for.
France and means the final renunciation
of the lost provinces. The Czar'a words,
"reasonable principles," are here under
stood to be a gentle hint to France not to
misinterpret the alliance in the direction
of the recovery ot Alsace-Lorraine. Hence
tho Gorman press concludes that the
Czar's visit docs not chango the status
quo, and that France must be contented
with the bloodless victories gained over
Germany in winning the Czar's favor.
The tariff discussion grows warmer.
The expressions of the Chambers of Com
merce against the bill are becoming more
froquent and sharper. The latter direct
their attack chletly against the system
of maximal and minimal duties on grain.
The Conservatives advocate an extension
of tho double system through the other
schedules. The Kreus Zoltung (Conserva
tive) points out that tho Dlngley aot
offers a model to follow, by permitting
a 20 per cent reduction of all duties for
reciprocity treaties.'
In this week's tariff discussions the re
cent Bpoech of Herr Moeller, the Prussian
Minister ot Commerctt, played an import
ant part, particularly his admission of
tho absolute nocosalty for the renewal of
the commercial treaties. Ilerr Moeller's
speech, which In understood to have ex
presiwd tho Government's vlows, threw
cold water upon tho exaRKGratod agrarian
hopea of Ineutlng on a oompromUo upon
the duties midway between the extremes
demanded.
The Agrarian premi has begun to attack
Horr Moeller violently for his speech, and
also for his friendly attitude toward the
UoorsQ rofcvrm law, dubbing him "Cnprlvl
Mottllcr." Tho Chamber of Commerce
,haÂ» unanimously condemned the tariff
bill bocauso of the extraordinary Increase
of duties on the necossarles of life.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept 2L-Both the Colum
bia and Shamrock II will come to the
starting line for the first race for the
America's cup In practically tho condition
they are now in. A little more burnishing
may be given to. their under bodies, but
it will scarcely be' of any service, as they
are now smooth as mirrors, -while it Is not
probable that additional sails will bo
tried' or stretched.
In a measure It-is the defending side of
the International match that is not thor
oughly prepared In the present challenge.
The failure of the Constitution to meet
the requirements of the challenge com
mittee of the New York Yacht Club was
both a surprise and to an extent a set
back for the home yachtsmen. Had Mor
gan of the Columbia felt that the old
champion would be selected to defend the
cup in time sufficient to give certain
orders, that yacht might have been a trine
better fixed for the struggle that will soon
be commenced oft Sandy Hook.
American yachtsmen, however, need not
fear about her condition when the pre
paratory signal is given from the regatta
committee's steamer nc::t Thursday morn
ing, Alt through the Bummer her form
was equal to that of nr y racing yacht on
tho face of the waters and she has not
gone back in the least The. challenging
party expresses great confidence that It
will win the cup, but that confidence Is not
new to Americans, and It is now heard,
as it has been heard in the past, without
causing any uneasiness on the part of the
custodians ot the old trophy. * :
Little Money Wagered.
Certain It Is. so far bj known, but little
money has been watered by visiting
yachtsmen or their frtonds to back their
opinions that Shamrock II will defeat the
Columbia. The same o4ds, fiooo to jsoo on
tho home boat, ruled yesterday morning
among the yachtsmen of Wall street with,
out takers, as has beÂ»n the case for
weeks.
The practice spins of tho challenging
yacht In American waters have been sat*
ufaotory to those concerned, and It ia
well that they have bÂ«ien so. All yachts
with spoed are apparently startling on
somo of their 'performnncea when sailing
alon*, hut just what they aro really able
to do can never ba fully shown until they
are alongside of lomo other fast boat. A
second in a mll.i may win an international
match; and what cxp<srt that live* can
tell whether this or that yacht whon salU
Ing alone Is so much faster or no mucn
slower than some other fast vessol? it is
easy enough to Judge how a yacht carries
her sail and how good ci sea boat she may
bÂ» If tried under varying conditions of
wtather, but to confidently predict that
Â¦he will be an old and conÂ«lstent per*
former without having another comÂ«
ngniunt her will be belloved only by man
unfnmlllar with yacht racing and the
peculiarities and caprices of modern rÂ»c-
Ing craft.
Columbia's Fine Itecord.
It Is well to pin one's faith to matters
of record in this sport. The Cotumbla has
been tried under all conditions of wind
and weather and she has not been disap
pointing. Her record In 1S89 was excellent.
How she caused the Shamrock I to euc
cumb is yachtln? history. That she is a
far better boat to-day that sho was then
is reasonable to suppose. How consistent
ly she performed In her many trials with
the Constitution her friends well know
and It was that fact that caused her to
be again selected to meet the challenging
vessel. It is Just this condition of things
that causes observing: yachtsmen of this
country to believe that the Columbia will
once more carry her fighting flag to the
front. It is said that the foreign yachts
men are so sanguine of winning the cup
that they are passing away the hours at
Brie Basin speculating: upon the condi

will impose uson the i Ne-v? York Yacht

WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â The name of
Admiral Sampson was mentioned to-day
for tho first time since the opening of the
inquiry, when Wilson of counsel for Ad
miral Schley indicated a purpose to com
pare the records of the two naval com
manders. Addressing Commander Schroe

Commander Schroeder replied that It hnd

the speed was nothing like as great as it
might have been. The battleships, he said,
ehould not have been held up because of
the collier; it could have been depended
on to come up later.
In reply to a question by the court Com
mander Schroeder said that the flre of
the 8panlsh battleships had not been
heavy enough to seriously injure the
American fleet.
Commander Hchrocder Bald that during

UPWARD of one hundred naval of
ficers of all grades have been
summoned to Washington as wit
nesses in the . case cf the
"Xavy Ring versus Rear Ad
miral Schley." The Sampson side, which
Is to prove that the officer whom the pub
lic at large has credited with destroying
the Spanish fleet at Santiago, is only "a
caitiff," "a coward." "a disgrace to the
navy." "a- man who would have been
hanged in any other navy"â is represented
by about sixty persons, chiefly of the
higher srades, while the witnesses for
Schley, numbering about forty, are of less
exalted rank. The fact, however, that
most of the latter served on the Brooklyn,
and therefore have a personal knowledge
of incidents prior and subsequent to the
battle off Santiago, is likely to make the
testimony of these witnesses of more im
port than that of the SampsoÂ« witnesses,
many of whom, including the commander
in chief, did not participate in that mem
orable light.
Glory Enough for All.
It was on July 3, 189S, that the Spanish
fieet in Cuban waters was annihilated,
and the present reunion of officers and
others who served in that war is a de
plorable incident in our naval history.
"There was . glory enough for all," as
Schley said, and but for the lack of dis
cipline among high rank officers, the ab
eeane of -esprit <ie corps, and. the conse
quent wagging: of envious tongues, there
â¢would have been glory enough for all,
â¢whereas now the testimony and findings
will go to prove that all naval officers are
not gintlemen and that some of them
fhoulu be dismissed with a view of im
proving the service.
The testimony before the court of in
quiry is likely to bring out many facts
net hitherto known, or only brought out
5n nan. Immediately after the battle off
Santiago naval experts a.t home and
abroad summarized a number of lessons
as the results of the fight. These deduc
tions were, in the main, so obvious as not
to impress the general public with an ad
miration for the clear-headedness of the
professional naval expert, and pertinent
questions were either not investigated or
dealt with in a gingerly fashion. To the
public at large the result of the battle
v.as enough to satisfy it that our navy in
Its material and personnel was all that
was claimed for it. Five of the Spanish
*h|ps were destroyed by the guns of our
ships and the sixth was run ashore and
surrendered to the Brooklyn after a race
nf a couple of hours. There was the
"magnificent burst of speed" of the Ore-
Eon, and the increasing speed of all the
ether vessels, not to ignore the New York,
the speed of which Captain Chadwick as
sorted was seventeen knots at the close
of the race.

Arthur Ward, a writer In the Engineer
ing- Magazine of December. 1S9S. charged
that our fleet was "unprepared to mak<j
a Quick movement of any kind in the face
of the cn*>my": that the ships were
"ready to shoot, but not to give chase."
This utatement was contradicted by Cap
tain Chadwlck, and the subject was not
lollowed up until the present time. Now,
however, aÂ« the conduct of the nenlor

facts may come to light explaining the

speeds attained at stated periods shows
most extraordinary humps and depres
sions for the American ships, while the
curves of the Spanish ships indicate a
gradual increase of power, the Viscaya
reaching her zenith of 16.75 knots at 10:35
and the Colon her highest speed of 19
knots at 10:45 and keeping it up for nearly
fifteen minutes. The latter ship was fitted
with water-tube boilers of the Niclausse
type, and her failure to keep up her
speed was probably due to the uncom
fortable proximity of the Oregon's 13-inch
shell, as well as to the fact that her
stokers were not Americans.
Lessons From the Battle.
Thet lessons which Engineer in Chief
Melville drew from the battle off Santiago
are to be found in his report under date
of October 1, 1S&8, and are briefly as fol
lows :
1. That fresh water for the boilers is almost
as Important as coal. . â¢ '
2. The great tactical advantage of water
tube boilers. Â¦ v . â¢ . Â¦
3. That if more than two main engines are
to be fitted, there should be three engines
driving three screws, and not two main en
gines on each shaft. ' The New , York ! and
Brooklyn had their engines disconnected at the
time of the Santiago tight' and could not stop
to couple them. â¢â¢,->". .,
4. That there I should be frequent trials under
forced draught to -keep the blowers in ' good
condition and to . make j the men - thoroughly
familiar with working .under maximum condi
tions. It appears that some of the ships had
never been under forced draught since their
contract trial until the day of the fight at
Santiago.
5. That the location of the forced draught
blowers is a matter of serious " importance. . â¢
6. That the personnel of the service should
be adequate to the material. â¢ â¢- .
. 7. That we must make provision for training
the enlisted men of the engineer department.
S. That our fighting ships must,- have the
highest practicable speed. Â¦ Â¦
The foregoing condensed but literal com
ments by Engineer in 'Chief Melville are
practically an admission that our ships
fell short of what they were expected to
do as to speed in actual warfare. It was
the guns that gave the victory to. the
Americans, and not the speed of the ships.
The high speeds credited to. the vessels of
all na-wies are in the great majority de
ceptive, and those of our navy are as mis
leading as those of other navies.
Beady /With Their Guns.
Unprepared as our ships Â¦were in the es
sential requisite of speed, there is no
question about their being ready with
their guns. The rapidness with which the
several vessels delivered the first fire is
certainly commendable. It Is to be as
sumed, of course, that* all the main bat
tery guna were loaded, ready for the
emergency, and that the supply of ammu
nition had been anticipated. The gunnery
practice, as it turned out to be, was only
good as compared with that of tke Span
ish ships, which was very bad. The con
ditions for good shooting were all that
could be desired, there being a* smooth
sea, little or no swell and the broadside
targets presented by the Spanish ships
were within range of the nve American
ships for nearly one hour. During thia
period the Teresa, Oquendo and the two
destroyers wero mink, tho VlBcaya shar
ing the same fate at 11:05 and the Colon
surrendering without any serious damage
having been dono to her, hut realizing
that the guns of tho Oregon and Brooklyn
having got her rango were likely to hit
and sink the ship. The Indiana, by virtue
of her closer proximity to the mouth of
the harbor, hn.l the advantage over the
other tthips of tho American squadron,
and no doubt the Teresa received her
death wounds from the Indiana. The
course taken by the Spanish ships and the
closing in of tho American vessels was
such as to shorten the distance between
the two contending forces for upward of
a half-hour, after which the Viscaya and
Colon , showed their sterns to _the pur
suers.
Distances Between Combatants.
At 10:30 the distance in yards between
the Viscaya and the then rftearest Ameri
can ship was as follows: Brooklyn 2300,
Oregon 3000, Texas 5100 and the New York
19,000. At 11:05 the distances were; Brook
lyn 2650, Oregon 2750, Texas 5100 and New
York 15,500.
At 10:30 the above named American ves
sels were distant in yards from the Colon
as follows: Brooklyn 3150, Oregon 3000,
Texas 4900 and New York 18.300.
At 11:05 the distances were: Brooklyn
9850, Oregon 10,800, Texas 13,200 and New-
York 23,650. At 1:15 the distances were:
Brooklyn 6500, Oregon 8600, Texas 14,800
and New York 18,100. . . ..

Course of the Colon.
The course made by the Colon, as de
picted on the chart, does not correspond
with tho report made by Captain Cook,
which states that tho â¢ ''Colon kept clos<]
to the land, running Into all the blnhte."
This would probably Increase her distance
run by two and one-half miles, inaUlu;;
. llfty-two nautical mllus, or an averaÂ«e
speed of U.1S knots during three hoars
and forty minutes. On the other hand lh<i
claim of Captain Chadwlck of seventeen
knots made by the New York at the end
of the chase Is not borne out by the locn
tlons on tho chart. Her average speed fell
from 14.43 knots, between 10:30 and 11:03
a. in., to 13.18 knoty* between 11:05 a. m. and
1:15 p. m.. and when the Colon struck her
nag the New Tork"wus 8.68 miles distant.
She arrived one hour later, thus making
an average epeed to 8.68 knots In the, last
hour and covering the entire distance of
55.01 miles In four fours and forty minutes,
Riving an average speed of 11.79 knots per
hour, a rather poor showing for a ship
with a trial speed of twenty-one knots.
With forced draught applied the Ameri
can ships should have reached their top
speed In half an hour after the race be
gun, yet at 10:15, or forty minutes after
starting, the Brooklyn had only reached
13.03 knots, and by 10:30 was bowling along
at the rate of 15.68, the Texas at 14.34, the
Oregon at 13.81, the New York at 13.03. the
Iowa at 10.92 and the Indiana, rated at
15.547 paper speed, was plowing up the
briny at the rate of 8.88 knots an hour.

$10,000. City Clerk Newby and Contractor
Giddings swore to the complaints. Swift

class of '89. The feeling against him is
strong. He has resided in OJal Valley four
years.. He came from Boston.

VENTURA, Sept. 21.â Morrison I. Swift,
an alleged anarchist, is in the County
Jail charged with libel for having de
famed and blackened the memory of the
late President McKinley. Swift is charged
with having used in part the following
language:
"It has been our charge throughout that
this insatiable murderer at the White
House never intended the American peo
ple to decide this question of expansion,
that he Intended to saddle Imperialism on
to them and buckle it so fast before they
felt its weight that though they bit ami

wanton conflict upon us did he know the
horrors he was calling down on our brave
men?

VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 21.â News
was brought by the steamer Hating this
evening that a citizen of Dawson, sup
posed to be an anarchist, was given rough
usage at the hands of a small mob on
Dawson's streets on Wednesday after
noon. The dispatch relating to the death
of President McKinley had been received
there early In the morning over the Â¦wire
from Skaguay. Dawson is a Canadian
town, but probably more than half of its
population is American, and the grief of
countrymen on both sides of the boun
dary line at the loss of the great Presi
dent was intense. Everywhere was the
feeling of regret and sorrow expressed.
One manâ a foreigner, whose name it
was impossible to learn â was bold and
foolish enough to say within the hearing
of people on the street that the assassina
tion should have been done long ago.
Two or three miners jumped at him and
dared him to repeat the remark. This he
doggedly did, and then for a moment he
was lost in the scuffle. A couple of
mounted policemen ran up, and but for
their interference it .would have fared ill
with him.

McCall for many years was a warm per

crease his life insurance in the last few

during his life and he had not been able
to save much. Up to 1SS7 his life insur
ance policies aggregated about $12,000.

Congress will grant and the money saved
by the President will be about $13,000 a

smaller companies. This statement is ab
solutely correct in every particular."

LONDON, Sept. 21.â A* special dispatch
SAN . . BERNARDINO, \ . Sept. 21.-Addl
tional interest attaches to the forthcom
ing court-martial of Captain O. P. Sloat
of the Seventh Infantry, National Guard
of California, because of the fact that
Major Prescott, who has just returned
from 'two years' service in the Philippines,
will act as Sloat's counsel before the mil
itary tribunal. Major Prescott has been
for years a close friend of Colonel Berry
of the Seventh, who preferred the charges
upon which Captain Sloat will be tried,
but on behalf of an old comrade in arms
he has decided to oppose his former com
mander. He has had much experience in
the Philippines as provost judge and as a
member of military courts and commis
sions, and is likely to put up a strong
fight for the accused captain. â¢
The court-martial will open in Los An
geles on September. 28. The charges em
brace twenty-nine specifications, are pre
ferred by Colonel John R. Berry in person
and are elaborately and skillfully drawn.
They relate entirely to the . paper work
of the service and involve no hint at
moral lassitude or conduct unbecoming
an officer and a gentleman.
The judge advocate who will prosecute
the case Is Major Jones, a lawyer of Los
Angeles, who is on General Last's staff.
Special Dispatch to The . Call.
There was no material " change in the
condition of Mrs. McKinley during the
day. Those about her say that she is
holding her own and that this is as much
as can be asked. To correct an impression
that has gone out in some quarters. Dr.
Rixey to-night authorizes thi3 statement:
i "Mrs. McKinley is not being kept up on
opiates or other artificial stimulation."
Crowds continue to visit the church, the
courthouse and the cemetery. The court
house will be kept open Sunday to accom
modate the people.
To all outward appearances the McKin
ley home this morning is but one of the
pretty comfortable homes of North Mar
ket street, Canton's most desirable resi
dence section. No guard surrounds the
beautiful lawn and no doorkeeper stands
at the door to greet and hold in check
the 6teadj r stream ' of callers that was
wont to seek admission during the life
of the late President. j *
"Mrs. McKinley's grief is intense. She
is doing as well as could be expected, how
ever. Too much encouragement should
not be taken at this early day regarding
her." 4>r
"Mrs. McKinley is Improving rapidly,"
said the doctor. "This matter of driving
out is a solution of the problem, I think.
She needs little or no medicine, but ex
ercise and good healthy mental occupa
tion will work a great change. I . feel a
high degree of confidence in' her ultimate
recovery, and am almost certain that the
dreaded collapse wjll not come.
CAXTOX, Sept. in.â Mrs. McKinley was
one of the' first in her North Market
street house to arise to-day. She said she
had enjoyed a good sleep and that she felt

to take another drive to-day. . r!-vvV r

The declaration of independence was
read by A. de la Torre, who prefaced his
reading by a brief sketch of the causes
leading up to its promulgation by Hidal

Mexico. Seventeen misses, including Zell

in a number of fancy dances, followed by
Mrs. Guadaloupe M. de Olsen in a con

Glowing Tribute to Race.
A glowing tribute to the Mexican race
"was paid by Hon. Samuel M. Shortridge,
who said in part:
There is no spectacle 60 worthy of admira
tion, so pleasing in the Bight of heaven, as the
heroic etrugrgle of an oppressed people to be
free. Such struggles call forth the noblest qual
ities of man. They mean danger and sacrifice,
courage and patience, the agony of tears and
blood. The sacred causes elevate and ennoble
Â«nd make of the lowly and obscure heroes of
the world and benefactors of mankind.
Every free, independent nation has her natal
dayâ some day when tyranny meets resistance
and freedom unsheathes her sword. Such a day
we who believe in freedom and walk under her
banner are met to commemorate. For the cry
of Dolores, uttered on the 16th of September,
ninety-one years ago, was the cry of freedom
end those who responded to her appeal were
heroes and martyrs, the memory of whose deeds
of sacrifice shall not die.

sympathy, says to her. "God bless you, my

from all harm."
"The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung
by the Paloma quartet, composed of the
Misses Lily Laws.' Millie- Murray. Ethel
Carroll and Eugenia Breitengross. F.
Carranza read a patriotic original poem,
and C. F. Jirninez delivered an oration in
Spanish, in which he dealt upon the fea
tures of Mexico's struggle for existence
and her friendly relations with this coun
try, and praised the late President Mc-
Kinley and Poifirio Diaz, President of
Mexico, in glowing terms. A series of
musical selections followed.

with and came to Redlands for medical
assistance. The citizens are greatly
aroused.
Mr. Garstin, his employer, who is in
Bear Valley, heard of his utterances and
immediately telephoned his discharge. It
is said Cox had several friends in readi
ness, who claimed they would protect him
from bodily danger.
When the report of the committee was
heard in â¢ Redlands by those interested a

REDLANDS, Sept. 2Lâ At , the time of
the assassination of President McKinley
Granville Cox, a laborer, working for H.
H. Garstin, one of the wealthy citizens
of Redlands, made the remark, "I am
glad of it." And later said, "It's worth
$100 tome." Not much attention was paid
to him at the time, but on Thursday aft
ernoon, when the people of Mentone, a
small town three miles east of Redlands,
returned from memorial services held in
the Congregational church in this city
Cox asked several, of the party, among
whom were three ladies:
"How many crocodile tears did you
shed for the old man?"
This enraged the residents. A commit

is a most remarkable -woman. I called on
her some time ago, and ahe told ma
among many other things that on the 2d
of September my house would be broken,
into and many valuables would be taken.
I scarcely could give . credence lo her
statement, as I have always been some-
what skeptical, and accordingly paid no
attention to the warning. I am sorry now
that I did not, for, true to this remark-
able woman's prediction, on the 2d of
September burglars obtained an entrance
to our residence and got away after se-
curing a large amount of valuables. It's
strange, but it's the truth, nevertheless.
If I had . taken Ismar's advice it would
never have occurred." Several others re-
lated how . the Egyptian had correctly
foretold some remarkable happenings in-
cidental to their lives. The evidence of
those who have called on this -wonderful
woman is of such a nature as to convince
the most skeptical that the past, present
and future can be told.

ISMAB.Investors in California mining proper
ties are turning their attention in so many
different directions that no one can ques
tion the general interest attending the
mining industry. In the northern coun
ties the copper prospects continue to at
tract the great share of attention. On the
Mother Lode Eastern men have recently
placed money and old mines bid fair to
be made productive once more. The in
fluence of the Sweepstake deal in Trinity
County is still felt in that section and
the inquiry for gravel mines continues to
be brisk. Great hopes are built upon the
developments in the gold dredging indus
try in the vicinity of Oroville and also
in other parts of the State where dredges
have been installed or will soon be oper-
Bhasta County has maintained the con
per interest- strongly. In addition to other
deals reported in the past few months it
is given out that eight- claims known as
the Brush Canyon group, .located one and
a half miles west from Copper City have
been bonded for $20,000. The old Burnnam

The Bakersfield Californian reports that
the Standard Oil Company has recently
offered to pay 20 cents per barrel for the
Kern River district oil and to take all
that it could get at that price. No greater
price than that has been offered to the
lvcrn County producers by the great cor
poration of Â¦which any knowledge has been
made public. The first offer was at the
rate of 15 cents per barrel. While th<j
syndicate had men in the Kern River field
offering these small prices other repre
sentatives were In the Fullerton field pay
ing from S5 cents to $1 45 per barrel. On
this point the Los Angeles Times says:
Throughout the oil fields there is more
of a stir than there has been for some
time past in the line of development work.
Cooler weather has something to do with
this. Los Angeles, by the formation of
its combination among the producing oil
companies , has already begun to reap
benefits In the .shape of better prices for
oil. Progress continues to .be made in
the Kern County sections. According to
the Los Angeles Herald there is little
seeming inclination to resume develop
ment on a large scale In the Los Angeles

the MoJave and Colorado deserts.- The

SHOW NEW LIFE
At the Chula Vista oil well the drill made
but two or three feet yesterday, but it went
through the Â¦. hard formation In which It has
been working for three or four days, just at the
time of quitting work last night The drillers
aid not find the oil sand beneath the coping
and will not be able to decide in what forma
tion they are until this morning. They do not
expect to strike the oil for some distance yet.
but the drill has been doing good work in
making depth. ; â¢ Â¦
This morning the workmen will. begin load
ing the oil well machinery of the Yuba Oil
Company, preparatory to taking- It to the
desert, where drilling will ue commenced at
once. The well is to be sunk near 1 Coyote
\Vells, somewhat further south than any of the
wells which have been started there thus far.
There is no work being prosecuted on any of
the desert wells at present. Mr. Bailey came
in from the desert recently and Mr. Hanna is
also In the city. The Barrett well had hardly
etarted and at the Harper well they are not
now working. Some of the promoters assert
that they are waiting simply lor the return of
cooler weather on the desert. -
George W: Marsh, who is greatly interested
la the well at Encinltas, Is trying to eet
enough people to subscribe to the stock of the
company in lots of 120 shares each, payable in
monthly installments, to carry on the work
The tools are in the bottom of the hole, at

The Coast Advocate-Pennant says that
Messrs. Frick and Parker have started
to drill at the Holtje place and will run
two shifts. They are operating in San
Mateo County. Messrs. Sallee, Hayne and
Guiberson have secured a new rig to
work on the Shoults ranch in Purissima
Canyon.
Although the Chanslor & Canfleld water
pipe line has been completed, so says the
Bakersfleld Californian, the property
owners along the line are still hampered
by the .price charged for water. One
property holder in the Midway made a
statement that he was paying $500 per
month for water to Chanslor & Canfield
for each rig in Â¦ use, regardless of the
quantity of water consumed.
The grading work on the Sunset road is
about completed and the track will soon
be down. The proposition to extend the
line Into the Midway district is again be

Water Is High Priced.
To take asphaltum out of a 16-inch vertical
hole may seem a tedious task, but the feat
has been satisfactorily accomplished In the
Kern River dlctrict, and why not here? The
process is simple and requires only the Intro
duction of steam to reduce the asphaltum to
a liquid state and the ordinary oil pump does
the rest. The only difference between the
work here and elsewhere is that here the work
will necessarily be easier, for the asphalt here
is almost pure, and In consequence may be
more readily reduced to a liquid state, while
In other localities It is found mixed with for
ei^n matter.
According to the Santa Ana Blade, as

The Jordan placer properties at Sum
merville and Petersburg, in Siskiyou
County, have been sold. They contain 300
acres of mining ground on both sides of

ported, generally speaking, to be quiet on
the South Fork while the fitting . up for
the season's run is in progress. The Black
Bear mine is* reported to have struck a
new body of ore. The King Solomon mine
is working and is doing considerable de

"'Fred Mahler is now making an effort to se
cure the ground of the Yreka Creek bed and
each Bide, between the southern boundary of
the town and the Blue Gravel mine on Green
horn, tb put in a dredger apparatus. He has
secured most of the ground already at a fair
price, but if blocked by unreasonable figures
may not be able to succeed. This ground will
no doubt pay.'well. but It will require a great
outlay for opening the same. The work is to
,be Â¦ undertaken .by Eastern capitalists, for
whom Mr. Mahler is acting-, and when they
see a ,wide difference In the price asked for
the use of the land, or really right of .way to
reach bedrock, it is doubtful whether any
agreement can be reached.
Several interesting announcements are

which are summed up as follows:
The work of collecting data for the forth
coming copper bulletin, giving all available in
formation concerning the copper deposits of the
State, is nearly completed and nearly all the
counties have been visited by. the field assist
ants. George A. Tweedy has been sent to
Colusa County to gather facts concerning
quicksilver, concerning which metal a bulletin
will also be . issued. G. K. Bailey will start
very soon for Southern California, having been
commissioned as a field assistant, to inquire
Into the saline deposits of the State. He will
visit Salton and portions of San Bernardino
, County and will examine the nitrate and borax
deposits of Death Valley. A map will be com
piled to give the location of these substances.
In the bulletins to be published Information
will be given for the benefit of the miner and
prospector , especially. The California State
Mining Bureau has received a gold medal
which was awarded at Paris for the exhibit
made by the bureau at the French Exposition.

The Redding Seachlight says:
A deal was consummated In Redding Wednes
day which seems to sound the death knell of
the Eureka tellurium mining property near
Middle Creek station. It was that in which
the' Eureka Tellurium Gold Mining Company
sold to the Tyrer Mining Company of Siskiyou
County all the machinery of the plant, Includ
ing that of both mill and mine.
The purchasing company will have the plant
set up on its property near Klamathon. The
Eureka tellurium once attracted great atten
tion.' ' It was believed to be Immensely rich.
The 1,000,000 shares of the corporation were
bought all over the country. The plant which
has been sold was installed, but the rock
could . never be worked successfully with it.
The anticipated values failed to show and for
years the property has lain idle.
According to the Trinity Journal work
l.as begun , on the Ajax group of mines
on the Oregon mountains. These claims
include 1800 acres of mining ground ad-
Joining ' the Sweepstake property on the
south. C. D. Galvln, managing owner of
the Galvln Dredging Company, will have
drifts run and will thoroughly prospect
the : gravel this fall. Upon this ,work
will 1 depend whether the mine will be run
as a drift or "as a hydraulic proposition.
In addition to the 1800 acres already held
by the company Mr. Galvin has patented
640 more. Trails are being made over the
property. ,
A. great amount of mining in quartzjin
addition to much prospecting, has, so
bays the .Yreka Journal, been carried on
at Humbug Creek. A new short cut road
between Yreka and Humbug is proposed.
Prospecting is proceeding on the north
and middle forks of the creek." The old
Knapp ledge on Humbug will be worked
again. â¢ ' . .^ â¢
The Coe mine, situated on >the Nevada
City road, near Grass Valley, has been
closed. down. The company that has
operated the Coe mine Is back of the Erie
mine at Granlteville. Operations may be
resumed, but the local' papers are not
sanguine on that point.
The Tuolumne Independent says that
the Brown, mine, near Tuttletown, will
soon, resume operations. Workmen are

driver, Joe Figioni, a fruit peddler, from
his seat onto the fender of the carÂ» He
was carried a block in this perilous
tion before the car was stopped at Jack
son street.
He was taken to the Emergency Hos
pital, where he was attended by Dr. Armi
stead, who found nothing more serious
than a slight lacerated wound over the
left eyebrow and a contused injury to
both legs. The animals attached to the
wagons fared worse, however, as a mule
hitched to Figioni' s vegetable wagon was
severely injured and a horse attached to
the other wagon, which came in for- a
second collision with the car, was badly
hurt.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
STOCKTON, Sept 2L-The San Joaquin
Valley Commercial Association convened
here to-day, with delegates present from
all of the counties in the valley. Presi
dent S. C. Smith of Bakersfleld called the
meeting to order and an address of wel
come was delivered by Orrln S. Hender
son, chairman of the Board of Supervi
sors. Irving Martin acted as secretary.
In calling the meeting to order Presi
dent Smith referred feelingly to the re
cent national bereavement. In speaking
of the San Joaquin Valley and the work
of the association he was very optimistic,
but at the same time referred to the ne
cessity of energetic, co-operative, organ
ized effort.
A. R. Briggs, ex-president of the asso
ciation, read a paper on the Supreme
Lodge of the Knights of Pythias, which
Trill meet in San Francisco in 1902. It
Â¦was a careful and exhaustive presentation
of the subject and served to bring out an
interesting discussion, participated In by
Mr. Briggs. President Smith, the railroad
representatives. C. B. Brown and other
delegates and F. E. Covey, who spoke
from the standpoint of a Knight of Py
thias.
The meeting resolved to undertake spe
cial advertising among the Eastern
Ivnlghts of Pythias, as the forthcoming
national convocation at San Francisco
will bring thousands to the coast. It was
the opinion of members that they should
be reached before they set out 'for San
Irancisco. as advertising would do little
good after they arrived and became en
grossed with fraternal business. The rail
road representatives promised to co-ope
rate, to the end that visitors be given in
ducements in the way of transportation,
by which they could pay a side trip to
this section.
At the afternoon session an interesting
paper on "Oil in the Construction of
fetreets and Roads" was read by H. A
Jastro, president of the Board of Super
visors of Kern County. He strongly ad
vocated the use of oil on roads and gave
the experience of Kern County with oil.
A paper prepared by A. G. Wilson of
Visalia on "Colonist Rates From the
East" was read. He took a decided
ground to the effect that the railroad
companies must radically, reduce their
rates in order to bring desirable colonists
to the State. He scored the railroads for
the policy of charging all the traffic would
bear. He claimed, in brief, that the
growth of the State had been retarded by
thetransportation companies.
V."hen the paper had been read Presi
dent Smith glanced at the coterie of rail
road men and remarked smilinglv, "It's
up to you, gentlemen."
T. C. Hocking of Modesto read a paper
on "Improving the Appearance of Things
in This Valley," which was In effect an
advocacy of making every day in the vear
an "arbor day." He said the unbroken
and dismal appearance of the valley in
summer did much to discourage immigra
tion. â¢
"How to Make Money in This Valley"
was read by Thomas H. Thompson of Tu
lare. He advocated diversified farming
and the offering of liberal inducements to
manufacturers.
The railroads wore represented at the
conference by Paul Shoup of the general !
passenger department of the Southern j
Pacific, Industrial Commissioner Davis of
the Santa Fc, G. W. Lupton of the Santa :
Fe. Division Passenger Agent Jones of
the Southern Pacitic and a number of
agents from valley points.

Advertising Will Be Done

ticular pleasure to me to hear him, as he
was the first wonder-child faf my experi
ence, and I have not heardjhim since. He
was just 10 years old when I heard him
in recital In Manchesterâ November ,11,
1SS7, to be exact-a slim little fellow irra
sailor suit, rather large-eyed and white
faced, but with a wonderful technique
even then. I well remember his funny
little trot across the platform to the piano
and his unconventional delight In a huge
box of candy that some wise admirer sent
up after one of his numbers; also- the
frown of his black-browed papa as Mas
ter Josef received it! His father taught
him then, I believe, and used to accom
pany him in arrangements for two pianos.
Little Hofmann's programme was a big
affair for a small boy. He played the
Beethoven "Moonlight- Sonata," a Chopin
nocturne, mazurka and valse; the "Weber-
Liszt "Polacca," Chopin-Liszt "Chant
Polonais," a Mozart sonata for two
pianos with Hofmann Sr., and the U3ual
selection from his own compositions. He
also improvised on a theme given by the
audienceâ it was ."Auld Lang Syne" by
all that's patheticâ and it all seemed to
me then a very wonderful sort of per
formance. K must have been, too, for
the small genius was accorded a splendid
reception by the great audience, 2500 peo
ple at the least, gathered to hear that
tiny, talented mite thundering away on
the big grand piano. But he is one of the
few wonder children that have amply ful
filled their early promise, ranking now
with the foremost pianists of the day,
and It Is good to know that he is on" our
musical menu for the season. . V:^.
Grand opera comes nearer, and the list
of names for the season grows longer
and richer every day. - It includes now
Calve, Emma Eames, Gadski, Sembrich,
Sybil Sanderson, Schuman-
Heink, Suzanne Adams, Louise Homer
and Carrie Bridewell. The list of men is
yet incomplete, but counts so far Marchi,
the new Italian tenor, about whom all
Europe is talking and whom Mr. Grau
picked up at the fag end of the Covent
Garden season, where he had electrified
an audience bored to death by a long
string of more or less tiresome tenors;
the favorite Van Dyck, Edouard de
Reszke. Dlppel, Scotti, Campanari, Jour
net and Blass.
The Royal Italian Band is one of the
nearest musical attractions. It "will be
heard at the Alhambra next month. ,Â«,It

SIgnor Creatore, whose trombone playing

Gabriel," and who has since found much
fame in the East as a conductor of the

Two recitals of exceptional* Interest will
be given this week at Sherman & Clay
Hall, the first a joint piano and song re
cital by Miss Annette Hullah and Harry
H. Barnhart to be given on Thursday
evening. Miss Hullah is lately from Lon
don and Is a member of the distinguished
musical family of the name. She is a
pupil, of Leschetizky. Mr. Barnhart, who
takes chanre of the vocal end of .the re
cital, is a pupil of the famous Florentine
teacher, Corteszi, and of Randegger of
London. Their unusual programme runs
as follows:

and humble effort it might be hers in
bu*. a few years that she can now so well
spare â for she numbers only 24 years â I
think Collamarina has the grit and hu
mility to face the situation.
She acts now by grace of the gods with
a tine natural audacity and emotional in
tuition that, with her strong personal
magnetism, not seldom compels belief in
her as an artist. But she is without real
artistry, without subtlety, without finish
or fineness in her work. -She lays on the
reds and yellows of gesture and expres
sion with heavy hand, and with only
the crudest attempts at blending cne
into the other. Carmen, perhaps her
most characteristic performance, ex
hibits her in all her glory and
imperfections. Sometimes, vocally and
histrionically both, for her altogeth
er delectable voice answers to her
every mood, there is a bit of pure per
fection that simply dazzles one into com
plete submission for the moment, leav
ing one later to tear one's hair at the
rough work that follows. It is only rare
ly that her instinct is at fault in the emo
tional coloring at the. role â the part is. of
course, one of the least complex in the
operatic repertoire â but it is as destitute
of shading as the conventional poster.
One moment she is theÂ»angry Carmen,
the next Carmen fascinating, and she is
both with all her body and soul for the
time. But there Is no transition period,
all is sharp-edged, untempered, disjointed.
Then, too, there are amazing gaps in the
conception, when she simply stops acting
altogether â as after the dance When she
sits and mops her brow In the most art
less manner imaginable and is frankly
Collamarini, not at all displeased with
what she has 'done and wholly willing to
let Don Jcse have his whack at the work
while she cools off a lelt.
She is a very good illustration of the
principle that there is no standing still
in the art we rid. It is either retrogade or
advance, and Collamarini is not advanc
ing. Her Carmen of last year was better
than this from every standpoint. She has
lost In looks from putting on flesh, that
further gives an appearance of coarse
ness to the roleâ in itself a frankly
fleshly concepUonâ that it did not have
last year, and her breath control from the
same reason is by no means so good. Her
sins in the use of her voice are more
marked, and altogether this richly gifted
young woman is not taking the place that
is hers by right of natural endowment
She has apparently every qualification for
an opera singer of all but the first rank,
* an adorable voice, temperament, beauty,
personality and rare capacity for hard
work and physical strength, all only need-
Ing training and direction under the stern
hand of a master. Whether or not there
is the intellectual equipment necessary for
the recognition of the fact, Collamarini's
future career will show, and that right
"Carmen" goes again this week at the
Tivoli, and "JCabucco." one of the earliest
Verdi operas, in which Salassa will be ex

WHILE the relations between the Governments of Germany, and Russia are apparently
the most cordial and pjeasant, those between the people of the two countries. are by
no means so happy.. The Kaiser and the Czar have none but affectionate and admir
ing words for one another, but the press of Germany, reflecting doubtless .the sen
timents of the industrial and commercial classes, has for Russia no words' much more pleasant than
a mild warning that Germany will not tolerate too much, and the Russian press retaliates in kind.
The contrast between the tone of'the governments and the tone of the press is sometimes"
amusing. The Kaiser recently issued an official manifesto concerning the Czar's visit, in the
'course of which he'said: "We welcome the Czar ; warmly. We owe it to the, mighty ruler who, -
while directing the destinies of many nations, endeavors to be the prince of peace and the pro
tector of humanity. Europe owes to him largely the shaping of the present conditions of the
world's affairs, which permits us to accompany his further trip with the siricerest wishes."
About the time the manifesto was issued and a welcome was being arranged for the
"prince of peace and the protector of humanity" the German papers were discussing Russian tar
iffs, and the Deutsche Tageszeitung -said: ''The Russians must learn that German friendship is as
valuable to Russia as is Russian friendship to Germany. Bismarck's declaration 'we run after no
body'was intended for. Russia also." v..:
, -The. Russians on their part are angry because of the proposed construction, of a German
railway from the Bosphorus to the Gulf of Persia. Referring to the road the Novoye Vremya
says: "There will then.be a new base of operations against Russian troops in Central Asia, be
dsides the capture of markets 'in which the Russians will no longer be able to hold their own." It '
will be seen the war lords are much more friendly in the two countries than the captains of in
dustry. Perhaps after all the Kaiser and' the Czar really maintain their big armies solely to keep
GERMANY AND RUSSIA.
THE Eastern press is at present
busily engaged in cordially con
demning the insulting reception ac
1 corded to William Gillette In his
*Â¦. recent production of "Sherlock
Holmes" in the English' capital. With
the co-operation of the author. Dr. A.
Conan Â«Doyle, Mr. Gillette undertook the
production in London of the play ;
written about his melodramatic and
world-famous, hero. Sherlock Holmes,
and those who remember his work in "Se
cret Service" will jiot doubt that as the
cool, keen detective Gillette could not
avoid success. The play, as a play, seems
to have failed, but Gillette, according to
Impartial critics, has done h,is rÂ»art as he
â¢ might have been expected to do it. Not
withstanding this, he was "booed" re
peatedly, and at the curtain call after the
last act could not make himself heard for
fully ten minutes under the storm of ad
verse demonstration that in London takes
the form of "booing." He won out,
though; waited until his courage under
trying circumstances compelled a hearing,
and then told the people a few things
about the whole duty of audiences. It
is largely alleged by the press that the
demonstration is the direct result of in
sular prejudice against the Americanizing
of the British theater, and was indeed an
organized .effort. Some of the best Eng
lish papers express sincere regret for the
occurrence, saying. that it is a matter of
almost national moment. Othors, again,
are inclined to the belief that the demon
stration was a rough but justifiable ex
pression of feeling against this American
invasion. Lyman B. Glover, commenting
upon; this In the Chicago Record-Herald,
says:
"it has been pointed out In these columns
many times that there was no inter.tion on the
part of England to permit a fair reciprocity in
theatrical matters with this country. Forrest,
Booth, Mansfield. Jefferson and other of our
important actors have been made to feel that
they were . not wanted in London, and such
unimportant exceptions as Goodwin, who is
j>n\y tolerated because hre wife Is a beauty,
or of "The Belle of New York." who had
legs to exhibit, do not alter the fact.
- Mr. Irving' Mr. WHIard, Mr. Haru and other
English actors of breadth, who are always
welcome over here, have sincerely attempted
to break down this bigoted unfriendliness to
Amerclan plays and players, but they have
not succeeded. Nor will' any one succeed dur
ing the present generation or until some politi
cal convulsion brings about the education and
enlightenment of the English common people.
It is the public schools that have given breadth
of sentiment to the masses in the United
States, and perhaps It is the compprative lack
of. them that has . made - the English lower
classes so narrow and 111 ,bred.
The popular "Florodora,". damned by

himself, and science (a professor), wealth

CARROLL D. WRIGHT, United States Commissioner of Labor, has on exhibition in the
department of labor at the Buffalo Exposition a record of strikes in this country dur
ing the twenty years ending December 31, 1900. The Commissioner is reported to have
stated in a recent comment on the display: "During the period named there were 22,793
strikes] with a wage loss of $257,863,478, a loss through assistance rendered by. labor organizations
of $16,174,793 and a loss to employers of |i22,73*i;'i2i| The lockouts during the same period
numbered 1005, with a wage loss to employes of $48,819,745, a loss through assistance rendered
by labor organizations of $3,451,461, and a loss to employers of $19,927,983. The total losses by
strikes and lockouts reached the vast sum of $468,968,581." :
A great part of that loss was an absolute loss not only to the employers and employes in
volved in the strikes, but to the community as a whole. The days that were wasted in idleness
can never be regained, nor can we in any way win back the profits of what industry might have
produced had they been days of work. The cost of strikes to the community has therefore been
enormous, and the damage is irrecoverable.
Out of the .direct losses there flow indirect losses to an amount which cannot be accu
rately computed, but must be verylarge. Had the sum of $468,000,000 lost .by the strikes during
the twenty years been earned, it would of course have been a stimulus to further enterprises and in
creased industry. jSuch portion of it" as was saved would have added to. the amount of capital
available for the payment of wages and the improvement of the community. . Thus the effects of
the strikes have been about as costly as would have been a great war, or the consequences en
tailed by a widespread famine.
The statistics relate only to the pecuniary damage done by strikes.' It would not be pos
sible to sum up in figures the wrongs done in other ways by the lawless and brutal elements of a
community who take . advantage of strikes to assault peaceable workingmen, and even at times
to commit murder. Nor do they show the extent to which cowardly officials of cities, and fre
quently State officials as wel\ degrade .the/, authority of their offices for the purpose of getting
votes among the lawless. The moral loss/in that way is as serious as the money loss, and there is
no telling how much American communities " have lost in their business \and_ their industries
through the cowardice of "officers intrusted with the duty of enforcing the laws and protecting
/ San Francisco is at present undergoing such a loss day after day. It is a loss inflicted upon
her not by. genuine workingmen who are seeking to better their condition, but by gangs of ruf
fians who will neither work themselves nor permit others to work; and who in their efforts to in
timidate others have committed outrage after outrage; some of their assaults leading even to the
death of their victims., There is ample evidence that many of the strikers would gladly return to
work 'if they were assured of protection. That assurance is denied by, the Mayor. So the whole
community suffers while a cowardly official does politics.
THE COST OF STRIKES;
rTP^ HE need of law. for human .government has existed since the organization of society.
1 ..The law as it is found everywhere is the latest "and best expression of the people who live
I under it. If it be defective, say in Russia, it is the best growth of the genius of ihat
Â¦Â¦Â¦ nation from Rurik to â¢ Nicholas.. If.it broaden and is better in the parliamentary nations
of Southern Europe, it is because the people have chosen to have it so. If in Great Britain it is
administered by a committee of Parliament, called the Ministry, but really chosen by the people,
it is because there Saxon institutions have reached a higher development and the people have
more power. Whether in the. United States or , abroad, law, for the' government of men and
nations, is the expression of popular genius, and between all law there is a kinship.
This sense of kin has been shown by the world's community of lamentation over the assas
sination of tlie President of the United States. The venerable Emperor of Austria added his
presence to the funeral formalities' of the American colony and legation in his capital. Royal and
.republican administrators of government vied with each other in lamenting the* slaughter of the
President as a blow at the common kinship of law.
The American people have received their third lesson in the vanity of that, boast we'liave
felt and used to make, that our institutions w/re proof against such a murder. When Orsini
started the long list of tragedies that blacken history, by throwing bombs at the French Emperor,
we raised our voices in republican pride, declaring immunity from such attempts in this country.
But this is all over now. ; The Czar that freed the serfs and the President that freed the slaves,
both fell under the hand of the assassin. The Prime Minister who destroyed slavery in the Span
ish dominions shared their fate. In each case a benefactor of mankind fell. But there is no dis
crimination. Wherever there' is law, its chief administrator is marked for murder. The murder of
a King is as much a blow at liberty as that of a' republican President, for it is law at which the
assassin aims, and law cannot be so light and so liberal as to avoid his destructive rage. ; ;
Americans can well make common cause with the people, and the governments of all
nations in isolating this pest of anarchy. With 2000 anarchists in Chicago, several hundred in
San Francisco and numbers of them in every city, it is time to be alert-and/banish this pest from our
soil. Nor is it useful to spare those who call themselves philosophical anarchists. Let them go
into isolation along with the /'Propaganda of the Deed"â the murderers who turn the philosophy
of. the school into pistol and poniard. They don't believe in government. Let them be isolated
where there is none. â¢ .'-,.."

â¢ Knights of the Maccabees.
At the last held review of San Fran
cisco Tent of the Maccabees a generous
welcome was extended to Sir Knight Theo
Frollch, the record keeper, on his return
from Louisville, Ky., where he attended
the session of the Knights Templar with
Golden Gate Commandery. He gave an
interesting account of his visit and, while
appreciating all the courtesies shown him,
he is of the opinion that there is no place
like San Francisco. This tent has been
doing quite well during the past month,
initiating candidates at each review, all
through the efforts of Sir Knight Green
berg, the special deputy, who has demon
strated that he is a "hustler" as well as a
famous story teller. This tent' has ap
pointed a committee to confer with com
mittees of other tents on a proposition to
have officers exchange places in the rit
ualistic ana degree work. It is believed
that where officers of one tent will do the
work for another tent, both in this city
and in Oakland," a new interest will arouse
In the work of the order. San Francisco's
degree team is improving and the claim
is made for it "that Sir Knight Shaw as
Judas is without a peer; that Sir Knight
Gafney is unusually good as the King;
that Sir Knight Savery is the embodiment
of the historical Eleazar, and that. Sir
Knight Vincillione presents Mattathias
true to life. As to the soldiers, they are
true types of those of ancient times." The
social games of whist of this tent are still
a feature of the evenings after reviews. ,

respective stations and carry them out
in the spirit and letter of the law. It was

Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being maileO to all who
will write tho State Medical Institute^
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled for years against .the mentar and
physical suffering of lost ; manhood that
the Institute has decided to distribute free
trial packages to all who write. It is a
home treatment, and all men who suffer
from any form of sexual weakness result-
ing from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The . remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth ana seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where. it is needed
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuseof the natural func-,
tions and has been an absolute success In
all cases. A request to the State Medi-
cal Institute, 328 Elektron building. Fort
Wayne. Ind., stating that you desire one
! of their free trial packages, will be com-
I plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
who are unable to leave home to be treat-
ed, and the free samples will enable them
to see how easy it is to be cured of sex-
ual weakness when the proper remedies
are employed. The Institute makes no
restrictions. Any man who writes will be
sent a free sample, carefully sealed In a
plain package, so that its recipient need
have no fear of embarrassment or pub-
licity. Readers : are requested to write

A wire rope ferry of 4000 feet, the long
est-of its kind in the world. Is to be built
across the , river at Dawson. . â¢ .
Edwin Daniels, accountant for Charles
Bartsch & Co., commission and meat deal
ers in Dawson, is said by, a Dawson tele
gram of the 17th to have left that city
for downriver points hurriedly with about
$40,000 belonging to the firm. Daniels was
practically manager of the concern under
James Cameron for a long time and was
â¢never- suspected of dishonesty. ; He Is
supposed to have taken ' a large part of
the money with, him." A telegram was
sent to Eagle City, and the American au
thorities there took him in charge. It., is
likely that he will be returned to, Dawson
at once. . ,
Â¦Since the passengers left Dawson the
remains of a supposed victim of murderer
O'Brien, who was recently hanged, were
unearthed by the mounted police. - A skel
eton was j found just above Dawson, not
more than a dozen miles from where
O'Brien was seen in company with a man
named Graves, who j afterward ' disap
peared. There was a bullet hole in one
of the bones and there were other Indi
cations that the man was murdered.
Graves was the companion of O'Brien In
some of the earlier escapades of the lat
ter, and the supposition is that he was
murdered to prevent his giving evidence
regarding their crimes. * .

PARIS, Sept. 21.â One of the most famous
physicians in Paris, whose name I am not
authorized to give, says that McKinley,
having escaped three dangers in the stom
ach woundsâ sudden death from shock,
which is rare; hemorrhage, which is fre
quent, and blood poisoning or primary
perltonltls^ â his physicians were justified
In issuing favorable bulletins. This phy
sician does not believe in the theory of
poisoned bullets, but attributes the gan
grene to the tearing of the wound, owing
to the small velocity of the missile. If
food could. have been given, nature might
have overcome the gangrene,; but as it
was, the case was beyond medical science.

SAN DIEGO PHYSICIAN
HAS NEW SNAKE STOBY
Four Hours After It Is
Bemoved." ,
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 21.â Dr. B. F. Mertz
mann of this city has come to the front
with the latest snake story. The doctor
is home from a mbnth'r hunting trip in the
Smith Mountains and gives the following
account of his experience with a big rat
tler:
"I had shot a dove and the bird fell close
by a bowlder. On going to pick it up I
discovered an immense rattlesnake under
the bowlder and shot it. It was three feet
four inches long, with eleven rattles. The
customary button was missing.
'"1 took the snake to camp, it wrig
gling and squirming the entire time, even
while it was being skinned and cut into
mince-meat on the chopping block. The
hearts of warm-blooded animals cease to
beat almost immediately after removal
from the body. With cold-blooded animals
5t is different. The hearts of these ani
mals will continue to beat under favor
able conditions for many hours afterward.
I removed the heart of the dead rattler
with its envelope â the pericardium â and
about two inches of the aorta (main blood
vessel) and the same length of pneumo
gastric and sympathetic nerves at 3:30
p. m. and placed them In a clear bottle.
The heart kept on beating with rythmical
regularity with its empty chambers, as
though it were still within the body of
the snake and pumping blood for dearlife.
The next day. twenty-four hours later, it
was still beating, but the pulsations were
becoming perceptibly weaker and more In
frequent.
"The thing seemed to reproach me for
having slain the snake, and I determined
to get it out of my sight. As I consigned
the rattler's heart to its last resting place
urder an oa.k tree it was still palpitat
ing v.ih grewsome regularity."

FRESNO, Sept. 21.â A mass meeting of
the Raisin Growers' Association was held
here to-day, M. Theodore Kearney pre
siding. The proceedings were markedly
free from the personalities which have
characterized raisin meetings on previous
occasions, and harmony was the prevail
ing feature. The meeting approved a
motion to allow the directors another
week . in which to obtain signatures of
growers to the new contracts. The most
important announcement made was 1 that
the directors had consulted leading pack
ers In San Francisco: on the previous day
and had approved proposals from certain
named I packers to pack Â¦ the . association's
raisins under the new contracts. This may
lead to keen and disastrous competition
with outside packers.

SAN JOSE, Sept. 2Lâ The move made
by a number of prune growers to bring
about the dissolution of the California
Cured Fruit Association is being freely
discussed by the orchardists and the out
come of the attempt to obtain the support
of two-thirds of the members is anxiously
watched by the officials of the associa
tion. "While the plan will receive consid
erable support in this valley, many be
lieve that other parts of the State will
hesitate about "taking action.
The committee appointed at the meeting
several days ago has formulated the peti
tion and submitted it to the directors of
the association. After requesting that
the affairs of the association be wound
up, it seta forth that under the- present
management of the association " and its
contract with the- Packers'- Company the
cost of marketing the fruit products has
been "vastly Increased' and made extraor
dinarily burdensome to every, fruit grow
er, and. that the association lias been un
able to maintain stability of prices or to
increase the prices of ; fruit in proportion
to the increased cost of marketing. It
is declared the past year's experience has
demonstrated to the growers that they
have been unable to obtain advances, on
their fruit after it is delivered to the
association, as heretofore, and that the
disastrous results attending the efforts
of the association -during the past year
have caused widespread distrust of the
efficiency of the plan of co-operation.
In their judgment further co-operation
under the present plan is futile and hope
less. Owing to this disaffection but a
small amount of the present year's crop
will be delivered to the association, and
the association will be unable to market,
maintain stability of prices or carry out
the purposes for which it was formed.
In requesting the dissolution ot the as
sociation, Philo Hersey and A. K. Whit
ton of this city and B. F. Walton of
Yiiba City are named as receivers in the
liquidation and six months from the 1st
of next November is the time fixed for
closing its affairs.
President Woods of the association de
clares the commercial packers are behind
the move and that. in bringing about the
association's dissolution they hope to ob
tain control of the prunes now In the
association's hands. The board of direc
tors will consider the problem at a meet
ing to be held on Monday afternoon and
define Its position. .

They were a sad-hearted lot of men that
brought the schooner Glendale into port
from Tacoma yesterday. Captain Falk
was accompanied by his wife and daugh
ter. The child was four years old and the
pet of the crew. A few days out from the
Sound she was taken sick, and on the 18th
lnst., when twenty-five miles northwest
of Point Arena, she died. It is thought
that the little one died of diphtheria, so
the body was taken to the quarantine sta
tion as soon as the schooner came in. The
schooner made a good average run of 11
days from Tacoma to San Francisco.

ICo sooner said man done, and inside of
fifteen minutes the Merchant was going
down the bay in tow of the tug. Passing
Meiggs wharf the captain, mate and cook
began making sail while Mrs. Carlsen re
tained her place at the wheel. Off Fort
Point the men saw they were going: to sea

o'clock last evening. There was
an unusual rush of- freight at the

The electric properties of this piece of
pavement became well known to the
throng later on, and until midnight groups
of men were standing there and using all
kinds of grips in their handshakes in the
hope of provoking good-fellowship and
curing supposed ills. The spot is now a
Mecca for all who are ailing, and unless
the electricity is soon turned on its
proper course the traffic of the street may
be blockaded by persons seeking a free
charge of electric fluid.
The newsboys and others enjoyed the
discomfiture of the shocked persons all
day. It appears that the underground
electric -wires had got out of order and
the electricity took possession of the
pavement. The dampness helped matters
along, and when handshaking or kissing:
occurred about the spot a circuit was
formed and the shocks resulted.
ihey wandered on their way in a quan
dary, and that piece of pavement contin
ued to be a stage for most peculiar re
sults and bewilderment for all who had
occasion to shake hands or display their
love with a vagrant kiss.
"\\ hy, my dear May," ejaculated a lov
able belle, arrayed in a rainbow creation,
as she threw her arms about May and
made an effort at osculation. It was only
an effort, for they parted without smack
ing their lips and so determinedly that
passers-by thought one had suddenly
learned some dread secret from the other.
xheir laces were pictures of astonish
ment and dread.
"Did you feel any peculiar sensation,
May?" asked the lovable creature after a
moment's pause.
â¢'Did I? Well, I guess yes. It was
awful peculiarâ and eo forcible," was
Hay's response.
It was rather shocking: for matinee girls
to shake hands or kiss their friends yes
terday at O'Farrell street and Grant ave
nue. The neighborhood is all right, but
the conditions were all wrong:. Right
where people board and alight from the
O'Farrell-street cars all the trouble was
occasioned. There is no excavation there,
end the pavement to all intents and pur
poses was in a perfectly normal condition.
A. dampness, however, had strolled over
the pavement before the matinee girls
appeared upon the scene.

One advantage about Grape-Nuts Food
Is that it is pre-digested In the. process of
manufacture; that is, the starch contained
in the wheat and barley is transformed
into grape-sugar in exactly the same
method as this process Is carried out in
the human body, that is by the use of
moisture and long exposure to moderate
warmth, which grows the diastase in the
grains and makes the remarkable change
from starch to grape-sugar. Therefore,
the most delicate stomach can handle
Grape-Nuts and the food is quickly ab-
sorbed into the blood and tissue, certain
parts of it going directly to building and
nourishing the brain and nerve centers.
"This is an Ideal food and evidently
furnishes the elements necessary for a
baby ,as well as for adults. "We ' have
used Grape-Nuts in large quantities and
greatly to our advantage. F. "W. Leavitt,
Minneapolis, Minn." , .
"I have a boy, two years old, weighing^
forty pounds and In perfect health who
frag been raised cm Grape-Nuts and milk.

. Mr. Collins then proceeded to argue de
murrers to the indictments. In the flrat
indictment the defendant is accused "of
presenting a false, fictitious and fraudu
lent claim for $198 37, which said fraudu
lent claim, Mr. Collins said, was admitted
to have been paid previously by the
United States.. Therefore, continued the
counsel, the admission is made that in its
origin the claim was not fraudulent. Sec
tion 5438 of the Revised Statutes of the
United States, under which the indictment
was found, means, according to the attor
ney's contention, . that the claim in its
origin was false, fictitious or fraudulent. ~
The second count was attacked on the
ground that it is alleged that on January
3, 1900/Dimmick presented to Cashier W.
K. Cole a false claim for $498 37 "that had
been fully paid by the Government on
March 26, 1900." S. C. Denson, Bert
Schlesinger and United States District At
torney Woodworth admitted that this was
a clerical error and that the date of the
presentation of the claim should have
been stated as "January. 1901, instead of a
year earlier." .
Mr. Collins demurred to the third count
charging Dimmick with having embezzled
the sum named, and contended that the
charge of embezzlement was an admission
that Dimmick had come lawfully into
possession of the' money, otherwise the
charge would- have been larceny; hence
the allegation in the second count that the
claim was false- was contradicted and
denied in the third count. Another point
was attempted to be made on the ground
that none of the indictments set forth the
kind of money alleged to have been em
bezzled and stolen.
Another charge was taken up that Dim
mick had failed to deposit in the United
States Sub-Treasury $362 47 on the 30th
of December, 1S99, and that when he was
requested by Superintendent Leach to
deposit it on December 31, the following
day, he had neglected to do so. There
was nothing in the indictment to show
he had embezzled any of the money in
this count. Embezzlement could be- com
mitted ' only when the accused failed to
deposit the money at all. Thejacfwas,
continued Mr. Collins, that all these sums
had been deposited by the accused long
before his arrest and indictment.
It was contended further that , the In
dictment charging Dimmick with embez
zling $30,000 was void, because it did not
state the kind of money and because It
did not lay the venue, that is, it did not
state that the crime was committed in tho
Northern District of California or- any
where else.
Mr. Denson replied briefly, and the mat-'
ter was taken under advisement.

YOUNG MAN" CHOOSES
A CRIMINAL CAREER
Lnder the Spanish regime the Catholic church
was the sole educator of the islands. Priests
were distributed in different parts of the
islands. Where there was no priest there was
a native who taught the children how to read
and. write. Of course, where the priests were
the children received a better education. In the
larger towns, where there were colleges the
young men received splendid educationsâ medi
cine. la*w, chemistry and all the useful arts and
sciences.
Efforts of the Church.
Father McKlnnon told me that Archbishop
Xozaleda had told him, and there is no reason
to doubt the Archbishop"s word, that he was
the first to urge the Spanish authorities to sur
render after Dewey fought the battle of Manila
Bay. Father McKinnon was the first American
to enter Manila during the hostilities, and he
was received most graciously by Archbishop
Nozale.-la. The Spanish priests are loyal to this
country and are doing all In their power to
make the natives respect our laws. The teach
ing of the Catholic church is to "honor thÂ»
King." The priests therefore are obedient to
those who are in authority over them. These
priests were all from Spain, and it Is only
natural that they were loyal to Spain while
they were under that Government, but now
that Americana are ruling the country they are
loyal to the ' United States.
Archbishop Chappelle is now at Rome making
a report of his observations in the Philippines.
I cannot say what changes or reforms he will
suggest. I often met Archbishop Nozaleda, his
predecessor, who was the head of the church
during the war. I do not know whether he ever
made the statement that the American troops
Would abuse the women of Manila should the
town fall into the hands of these invaders,
but If he did I. do not blame him; I will tell
you why. I think that Archbishop Riordan's
actions would be Justifiable, if a Spanish force
attempted to invade San Francisco If he tried
to enthuse the soldiers to resist until their last
drop of blood was shed in defense of their
country.
Archbishop Is Reporting.
Any man of fair and impartial mind could
not fall to be impressed with the work that
the Jesuit order has done m the Philippines.
The Jesuits have magnificent colleges estab
lished there and they have educated the bright
est minds in the island. In Manila they have
a college which is attended by 1S0O pupils.
Men of the brightest intellect who have paid
a visit to this college have never left there
without gaining more knowledge than when
they entered. ' â¢
..The Jesuits at the college in Manila have an
observatory that has proven so efficient that
it has received the compliments of this Gov
ernment and is, I am almost eure, receiving
a subsidy from Washington. When the Ameri
can Government took possession of the Philip
pines they received from the Jesuits all the
data and statistics of the islands, and they
were all found to be absolutely correct. This
data was forwarded to Washington, was print
ed and is now in book form on file in the de
partments.
That certain orders of the Catholic church
have lost the affection of the natives is -true,
but I will give you the cause. Under the
Spanish regime in many districts the friars
or priests were placed in office as magistrates
as well as spiritual advisers. These priest3
were held responsible to the Spanish Govern
ernment for the good order of the district they
lived in. The Â¦ feeblest mind can understand
that when a priest had to act as disciplinarian
and administer justice and sometimes punish
it would naturally follow that the affection
that should be held for him by the natives
would be obliterated.
If you take a plant and attempt to force its
growth you stand in danger of killing it. The
same situation confronts the church in the
Philippines. The priests have gone very slow,
but they have -worked faithfully to educate
these savages. The Filipino is a savage and
will be one tor hundreds of years .to come.
The Situation in the Islands.
A fair way to look at any work is by re
sults. The ' natives of the Philippines are the
most civilized and advanced race of savages
in the Orient. The Chinese have been pouring
into the islands tor hundreds of years, yet the
Fiiipino race has still been preserved. The
Catholic church first took a foothold in the
Philippine Islands about Â£00 years ago. Since
that time she- has slowly but surely educated
the Filipino race. Their work may appear
slow, but then, on the other hand,' it has been
sure.
In an interview last evening he said:
Persistent rumors have been circulated
at different times to the effect" that the
friars, and in fact the whole Catholic
church in the Philippines, were guilty of
various off enses.' -The question became so
serious that Bishop Potter took the stand
that the entire property owned by the
Catholic church in the Philippines should
be confiscated. President HcKinley was
requested to look into the charges, and
he with cool and fair judgment referred
tho matter to the Philippine Commission.
The controversy is not yet settled and the
views of General James Smith, now at
the California Hotel, will be of interest.
General Smith was a resident of â¢the'Phil
ippines for over three years and is in a
r<-sition to know- the true state of affairs.
He boldly champions the cause of the
Cfctholic church.

Resolved, That In response to' the general
sentiment of the community, the McKinley
memorial committee hereby resolves Itself into
a committee for the purpose of erecting a mon
ument in honor of our. martyred President; that
we agree to render any service in this behalf
when called upon, and that the executive com
mittee of this body be instructed with full
power to collect and receive funds for such
purpose and erect in the city of San Francisco
a suitable monument to commemorate the vir
tues and patriotism of William McKinley latÂ«
President of the United States.
After a discussion in which the project
mot with the hearty favor and the prom
ised co-operation of the members of the
committee the following resolution was
adopted:
Committee Adopts Resolution.
That our citizens desire to raise some testi
monial expressive of their love of William Mc-
Kinley, the man, and President McKinley, the
martyr, there is no doubt, and I ask this com
mittee to take such action as it may deem
proper.
It has been suggested that in one of the
oval spaces of Union square, as you approach
it from the corner of Geary and Stockton, for
instance, a sitting or a standing monument
be erected to him which will harmoniously
blend with the navy monument in the center,
thus associating his administration and the
achievements of our .navy, particularly In the
Pacific; and it -has also been suggested, as a
new and original idea, to erect a monument of
granite and bronzeâ a column,*- group or a
tower â on or near the shores of the Pacific,
in or at the termination of the Park, looking
out upon our distant possessions, Hawaii < and
the Philippines, which have fallen into our
hands directly or indirectly as the result of the
war, and all under his administration. . San
Francisco is in a particularly favorable posi
tion in this respect, having the shores of the
great ocean, the Pacific, which will be indeli
bly associated with the name of McKinley. so
far as American history is concerned, within
its own proper confines.
Suggests Location for Monument.
Our citizens have provided a monument in
honor of "the American navy in- commemora
tion of Admiral Dewey's victory at" Manila
Bay," for which the contract has been' let and
which will stand in the center or Union square.
A contract is about to be let within the next
few weeks out of the surplus of the fund raised
to receive and honor the troops who returned
from the Philippines, especially the First Cal
ifornia, for the construction of a monument
on whese base will be inscribed the names
of the men who enlisted in this State
and gave up their lives gloriously, at the call
of the President, to their country..
Now, we have the sad yet loving duty of pro
viding a permanent memorial to the President,
the glory of whose administration was the
achievement of victories by land and sea, which
lifted the American name to honor and re
spect among the nations of the world.'
Gentlemen: It was suggested that- after wo
had penormed our willing labors in providing
for tntj memorial services we stiouid meet as
an executive committee to erect a permanent
memorial in commemoration ot the virtues and
patriotism of our martyr i'reslaent. No time
is more fitting for mid work than the pres
ent, when the people desire to give tangible ex
pression to tneir sympathy and love for a great
and good man and to hold up his example to
after generations.
Mayor Ph.elan Urges Action.
The executive committee of the Citizens'
Committee of One Hundred, which had in
charge the memorial exercises in honor
of the late President, met yesterday morn
ins in the Mayor's office. The committee
decided to effect permanent organization
for the purpose, of erecting a monument
in commemoration of the martyred chic-r.
The monument will be erected either in
Linon Square or on the shores of the l'a
c-fic Ocean, the precise location to be se
lected later. . â¢
It is intended to raise the sum of *25,CO3
by popular subscription, but the commit
tee is of the opinion that the public will
bo so eager to subscribe for such a tesci

from their answers was that they believed

to as=k the directors of the Board of Trade
of San Francisco to act, and this' will be
the first to be called by the business men
to act with tlie Chamber of Commerce. :
Such action upon the part of the board
of trustees of the Chamber of Commerce
of San Francisco requires no comment.
The members Â¦ of the Â¦ Chamber are " con
nected with other commercial organiza
tions in this city. They have, announced
their intention to introduce ' resolutions
similar to thos 2 adopted by the Chamber
of Commerce before the trustees and di
rectors of the kindred bodies in San Fran
cisco. Among these are the Merchants'
Association, the Manufacturers' and Pro

Board of Trade;
The bare statement of the facts, the se
verity of the humiliation which the lead
ing business men of San Francisco have
seen fitting to put upon a jour
nal of great pretensions as an exponent
of public opinion, and the evident earnest
ness which actuated the trusteesâ more
than all, the enormity of the offense that
is laid at the door of the Examiner in
connection with its actions before and
since the hand of an assassin struck down

Statesâ make up an arraignment which is
impressive.

Then the trustees passed over a review
of the true limitations of the liberty of

McKinley during his most useful lifetime, and
afterward affected sympathy during his sick

their resolutions the trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce, all representative
men. arraign the Examiner with scathing
words, which they have Judged to be suit
able for the occasion. They say:
Â¦Â¦From* this brief statement of the con
stitution of the Chamber of Commerce it
will be inferred that this commercial body
has not taken radical action without rea
son. , Moreover, the causes which have im
pelled its action have been set forth in
formal resolutions, . adopted only after a
discussion sufficiently long to determine
the opinion of each of the gentlemen who
make up the board of trustees as to what
should constitute their fitting, proper and
dignified action in the premises. A set of
resolutions, which is published herewith,
was adopted without a dissenting voice.
The secretary of the chamber, acting
under instructions of his superiors, has
furnished a copy of the resolutions to each
of the daily papers published in San Fran
cisco, with the exception of the Examiner.
The Chamber of Commerce is known
throughout the world. It embraces in its
membership more than 400 great commer
cial houses, the banks and insurance com
panies of San, Francisco, the representa
tives of its vast shipping interests, promi
nent manufactures and leading men in all
walks of commercial and industrial life in
the metropolis of the Pacific Coast.

at North flohl. near here. Egan played
Kood golf, except toward the end of the
first nine holes this morning, when he be
came a little unsteady. Travis' play wan
also faulty. There were several periods
during the match when he plnyed tar bo
low his usual form, but, being a veteran
of many a golf battle, he recovered more
quickly than did his younger opponent.
The champlon'u strongest point was his
long game, and It was through his good
drives that he was enabled to win. Ho
outdistanced Egan on every drive, except
In two or three instances. Travis' direc
tion was also above that of Egan, tho
latter several times being handicapped In
a drive too far to the right or left. There
was not much to choose between in the
short game of the two men. Taken as a
whole, the work of both on the green was
a little below their top game.
The morning round of eighteen holes
was a much better exhibition of golf than
the afternoon performance. A-t the end
of the first nine holes Egan was one up,
but Travis, by clever play, managed to
make the match all square at the end -of
the morning game.
In the afternooniit soon became evident
that Travis would win. He was two up
at the turn and made four up on the next
two holes. Here the Western youngster
held him for two holes, but on the four
teenth the champion, by excellent golfl,
won.

The meeting of Joe Walcott and Georg
Gardner in the ring at Mechanics' Pavl
ion next Friday night is furnishing foo
for animated discussion among the fa
lowers of boxing.
W'alcott's physical condition and Gard
ner's hand, which he injured in the Car
ter light, form the basis for much of the
discussion. From the manner in which
Tom O'Rourke's boxer has settled down
to work it can safely be said he will be
nt to tight for hi3 life when the gong
sounds. He was in fair condition when
he arrived here ana settled down at once
to strict training. Ho covers ten miles
on the Mann County roads every morn
ing and works for an hour or more each
atternoon in his gymnasium at Larkspur.
The work he is uoing under the direction
of V"oung Mitchell has already commenced
to show.
His eyes shine like diamonds, and he
got'3 through his allotted work as though
ne enjoys u. His breathing apparatus is
in good order. He shows no sign of dis
tress no matter how severe the work may
be in which he is taking part. He haa
been boxing all com<:r3, from heavy
weights to lightweights, accepting what
ever punches they could land ana giving
others in return.
Gardner's only boxing is done with Alex
Greggalns. The latter wears a protecting
shield like that worn by baseball catchers.
This reduces to a minimum any danger
of injury to Gardner's hands. His sprained
thumb is practically as strong as ever.
He punches the bag with as much aban
don as tnough the thumb had never been
Injured.
The disparity in the size of the rival
boxers iÂ§ .remarkable when set down in
black and white. In reality It will not be
so great when they put up their hands In
the ring next Friday night. Gardner is
ten and one-half Inches taller than dusky
Joe, but when he assumes the crouching
attitude of the boxer the disparity dis
appears. Ring followers who have seen
Jeffries in action will remember that when
he crouches his head isi hardly four feet
above the ground. This give3 Walcott
an advantage, as he can stand In a nat
ural position, ready to use either hand
with telling effect.
. In spread of arms from tip to tip Gard
ner has twelve inches the advantage over
Walcott. This is also deceptive, as the
actual "reach" of a boxer is a quality hard
to determine. Gardner has an unusually
long left arm, which- It is difficult to get
under. Walcott haa the arms of a heavy
weight. They are out of all proportion to
the rest of his body and', are smooth and
round, apparently devoid of muscle. This
is deceptive, as the smooth, easy working
muscle is there ready for action.
O'Rourke, Walcotrs mentor, has left
New York for this city. He is due here In
ample time to necond his man In the ringr.

JEFFRIES WILL TBAIU"
AT HARBIN SPRINGS
Champion's Brother JSays. Any Son
Franciscan Will Be Acceptable
" :.' : -' as Referee. '.' r * :
FRESNO, Sept. 21.â The main attrac
tion of this evening in Armory Hall was
the sparring exhibition between Jim Jef
fries and his brother, Jack. Jeffries will
go to Visalia from here and from I there
will go directly to Harbin Springs to
train for his battle with Ruhlin. Jac't
Jeffries said to-night that any referee
selected by the Twentieth Century Club
would be acceptable to the champion. Jim
had a preference, of course, he added, but
any good San Francisco man would do.
Jack Solomon of Fresno received, the
decision In the sixth round In the eighteen
round contest scheduled with Gean West
of St. Louis. Jack Jeffries, the referee,
after cautioning West several times on
account of his foul tactics, declared him
the loser. Â¦ â¢
"Sailor" Sullivan -was given the decision
over Fred Lord on a foul in the sixth
round. .
Notes of the Game.
A number of the fans seemed to think that
Dun'.eavy played "dirty" ball when he blocKed
r.eilly at third. On the contrary he did a
clover stunt, cs it is always the baseman's
]-r;vilÂ«xv to cover his base as long as he doea
not touch the runner with his hands. Dun
leavy did not hold Reilly.
Drennan robbed Pabst of a double when he
made his sensational one-hand catch in the
**cond Inning.
Moskiman was played in the right gardeD.
and he showed up strong-, making two runs
tTK 4 - ah many hlte.
Dunleavy was on third base yesterday and
p.ayed a fast game, accepting .several chance?
without an error. He should make an ex
cellent lnflelder.
Nordyke bad his batting- eye with him, and
rappt-d out three clean hits, one a two-basrser
to right flejd.
Brockhoff was put in to bat in Iburg's place
in the seventh, but fanned the air three
times.
Cal Ewing would do well to keep Strelb on
the initial, bag. as he is undoubtedly the best
man in the league when it comes to handling
badly thrown balls.
Nordyke. Krugr and Wilson 'did the Â¦ bulk of
the locals' = batting yesterday. They made
seven out of the nine hits secured by the Ger
mans.

On the eve. of bis departure for Austria,
where he will join the colony of American
riders now winning fame and dollirs,
"Chub" Russell made a "Garrison finish"
of It yesterday at Oakland. Through all
around good work Russell landed first lit
the wire on four winners, in Flamero, 3 to
6; Shellmount, 3 to 2; Vantine. 2 to 1,
and Decoy, 9 to 5. . His followers got all
the coin. A good rater and strong finlshor,
"Chub" should more than hold his own on
the other side.
In the one harness event, a ' special
trot, George W. Kingsbury carried off
all the honors. The popular hotel
man held the ribbons over Lynall, 2 :10V4,
and, though an amateur, more than held
his own with the professional drivers,
winning the second, third and fourth
heats through clever relnwork.
While the weather was gloomy and
threatening, racing has such a strong hohl
on the affections of the public that both'
the grand stand and becting ring wct-3
crowded. Betting on the trot was nervous
and shifting, but on the running events it
was heavy, with Flamero and Decoy the
only successful favorites. Â¦ .<
At first the supposed knowing ones
picked Puerto Rico to win the trotting
fixture, but the brown gelding, although
made a favorite, proved a disappointment.
Ed Lafferty, behind Floradora took the
first heat, backed down to favoritism,
with Lynall a good second, in 2:29. After
this Kingsbury went out and won the next
three heats in commanding fashion with
Lynall, the victory being a popular one.
Flamero Outclasses His Field.
Cameron's Flamero apparently out
classed the other starters in the seven
furlong run, next to oe decided. The
gelding's friends accepted the 3 to 5 laid
about him and cashed their tickets with
out ever having cause for worrlment. El
Mldo bled slightly, losing the place to
Lost Girl.
At last Lief Prince- earned a pair of
brackets. One of six starters in the six
furlong sprint following and 5 to 1, H,oar
brought the colt home first, a length be
fore the favorite, Mamie Hildreth. Tullett,
on Pegalong. finished third.
Beyond question the 2-year-old handi
cap at five furlongs furnished the prettiest
contest of the day. There were but four
starters and the quaicet got away on
even terms to a flying start. Russell
rushed Shellmount to the front, and in the
stretch wa^s challenged by the favorite,
Hainault, with McCarthy up, and the
light weighted. Flo Culver. Shellmount
stood a long, hard drive, getting the ver
dict by a scant half lengxh, with Flo Cui
ver only a head farther away. More
Judiciously ridden,' the -latter filly "could
have won. Louwelsea is not at her best.
Rollick, the Burns & Waterhouse entry,
went to the post an even money favorite
for the fifth race. - Cut off soon after the
start, the gelding finished third. Vantine
made all the running and, with little to
spare, downed Mike Strauss a length.
Owing to the slipping of McCarthy's
saadle, David S ran away two miles be
fore he could be stopped and his tired
rider assisted back to the paddock.
A four and a half furlong dash for 2
year-olds saw Botany close a slight favor
ite over Quadra. Ransch, on Dawson, a
3 to 1 chance rode a splendid race and,
outflnlshlng Howson on Wandering lioy,
won by a neck. Botany, after cutting out
the pace, ended up in the show. '
Looking best on paper, Decoy, the
favorite, well handled by Russell, cap
tured the seventh and closing event, a
mile and fifty yard affair. Toribio led for
a time, when the first choice went ahead,
scoring cleverly from Alicia and Lizella. '.

Cal Swing's much abused aggregation of
cripples, as if to atone for the miserable
farce which they enacted on Friday, took
the measure of Uncle Henry's Germans
yesterday to. the music of four to three.
The weather was dull and cloudy and the
players, expecting rain at every moment,
exerted themselves to their utmost In or
der to give the tans at least their money's
worth. Their eilorts proved highly suc
cessful, for there was not a dull moment
In the whole, game, the end being in doubt
until the last man was retired.
Uodson, the twirler who is haunted by
the spirit of hard luck, officiated In the
box for the Dudes, while Iburg and Wha
len alternated lor the Dutch. The pitch
ing was even up, each team getting nine
safe bumps, but the Dudes bunched theirs
just at the proper time. Uncle Hank can
eafcly lay' the blame' for his defeat on
â¢â¢Josh" Reilly. In the seventh, after two
were out, Shav and Reilly were on the
bases, when ICordyke sent out a clean
double. Shay came home, but Dunleavy
blocked Josh at third. Reilly instead of
coming home ran out in the field and be
Â£an an eloquent discourse . with Rube
*vy. Dunleavy got the ball, tagged him
and the locals' last and best chance to
score was gone.
The Benedicts made their four runs In
the second and sixth. In the second a
pass and singles by Mosklman and Loh
man and a two-bagger by Arrellanes
earned three tallies. In the sixth another
Â¦was added by means of an error and'
Drennan's hit.
The Germans made their three points in
the fifth and seventh. In the fifth Krug
and Reilly went the route, aided by a
couple of good hits and a fumble by Hod
eon. Their last chance was spoiled in the
seventh by Reilly's endeavor to make an
orator of himself.
The features of the game were Nor
dyke's hitting and Drennan's great one
hand catch against the center field fence.
For Oakland Dr. Mosklman, Lohman and
Arrellanes did the best stick work. The
score:

A meeting of the members of the Sau

Friday night, Major T.\"W. M. Draper,
president of the club, being in the chair.
The extensive building operations which
have lately been carried on at Fort Baker
have for several months past rendered the
links practically unavailable, though a'
few enthusiastic members have, kept up
practice even under the discouraging cir
cumstances. Â¦ The changes made by | the
United States military - authorities . have
rendered It i necessary to lay out afresh
the first, second, third' and ninth holes,
but the new putting greens are now ready
for use. The club has a good sum in the
treasury, and will proceed at once to put
the course Into playable condition. The
clubhouse will also be formally opened.

READVILLE, Mass., Sept. 21.â The
great stallion Cresceus (2:02%). obtained a
firmer grasp on his crown as king of
trotters by defeating his only rival, The
Abbot (2:03 l /4), on the Readville track .to
day in three out of four heats. The two
fastest trotters in' the world raced for a
$20,000 purse offened by Thomas W. Law
son. The money' which the 12,000 people
paid to* see the event all went to a well
known local charity. The weather was
perfect, but the track was heavy, so no
records were broken nor approached, the
fastest time, that in the last heat, being
only 2:07%. - :
The race was disappointing to a large
majority of the crowd and seemed to lead
to the conclusion that The Abbot has not
recovered from his sickness of last spring.
The Abbot broke repeatedly and lost val
uable distance. In the first heat he went
oft* his feet before reaching the first turn
and was ten lengths behind at the finish.
He managed to keep up in the second and,
lo the delight of the crowd, passed Cres
ceus at the half and won -by a length.
In the third, however, another break came
right at the start and the Scannell horse
barely saved his distance at the finish.
Finally too weights were resorted to, and
while they apparently steadied The Ab
bot, at' the same time they sapped his
vitality, bo that when the moment came
for the supreme effort in the dash for the
wire in the last heat exhausted nature
rebelled and Cresceus won the heat 'and
race by several lengths.
The Abbot Breaks Badly.
It was early In the afternoon when tlie
two great trotters camo out for their
first trial. Ketcham won the toss, giv
ing Cresceus the pole. After scoring
three times the word was finally given,
and away they went with Cresceus in the
lead. In the scoring The Abbot had acted
badly, so that few were surprised when
at the turn he suddenly went into the air
in a bad break. By hard work Geers got
him back on his feet, but by thin time
Cresceus was far in tho lefed, over a
dozen lengths to the good. It looked like
a hcpele3S race for The Abbot in . that
heat. At one time it seemed Cresceus
might be able to shut out the Scannell
horse, and win the big purse, then and
there, but Geers managed to pull up a
little and at the half was only ten
lengths behind. This distance was still
farther reduced by the time the three
quarter polo was passed, and at the turn
Into the stretch The Abbot was safe.
Geers made no attempt to push his hÂ»Â»rse
further, so Cresceus won the first lieat
by ten lengths.
The second heat proved most exciting.
This time The Abbot kept his feet, but as
usual Cresceus went out at the start and
again led at the turn. At the quarter
pole he was a length to the good and. in
creased this distance to two lengths at
the three-eighths. Then .Geers began to
drive, and rapidly cut down the distance
to a length, half a length, a quarter of
length, until, just after the two swept by
the half-mile pole, The Abbot dashed
ahead and for the first time took the lead
and the pole. The crowd, which seemed
to favdr The Abbot, was frantic. Geers
made the lead two lengths, and then
three, and so the flyers entered the
stretch. Ketcham gave the big chestnut
the severest punishment he had ever
undergone at this point, and smarting
under the stinging blows of the whip,
Cresceus dashed after The Abbot. Geers
touched his horse lightly with the whip
once or twice and then only enough to
keep Cresceus from winning. The Abbot
finished first by half . a length.
Horses Score Repeatedly.
In the third heat The Abbot again* acted
badly, and the two horses scored five
times before they got the word. Ketcham
kept sending Cresceus out ahead, with the
apparent intention of getting The Abbot
off his feet. He- succeeded so well that
when they finally got the word The Abbot
broke right un3er the wire. In fact, the
break came with the starter'3 word, but
too late for the horses to be recalled.
Again Cresceu3 sped out ahead and was
around the turn before The Abbot had
even started In the race. This time it
seemed Ketcham had won his trick and
had The Abbot fairly out. He drove
Cresceus like the wind and was over fifty
yards ahead at the half. But Geers did
not despair. He once more sent The Ab
bot along and managed to get well with
in the distance flag when Cresceus passed
under the wire, a heat winner by nearly
forty yards.
Before the fourth heat was called two
ounce toe weights .were put on The Ab
bot's hoofs in order to steady him. Both
drivers came â¢ to the conclusion that the
track was too heavy near the pole, so the
horses were started well up on the outside
of the track. They scoied twice. Then at
the word Cresceus immediately went out
in front and was three lengths to the good
at the quarter pcle. . For a few hundred
yards The Abbot trailed along behind,
but before the half was reached he began
to draw up and was only two lengths be
hind at that point. Foot by foot the Scan
nell horse pulled down Cresceus' lead, un
til at the five-eighths pole the two -were
racing along on even terms, to the evident
delight of the crowd. : At the three-quar
ters The Abbot was in the lead, but. could
not take the pole, which Cresceus kept to
the Â¦ finish. The brush around the < turn
killed The Abbot, and when at the .begin
ning of the stretch Cresceus came up
Geers found his horse exhausted.
A perceptible groan went up from the
crowd as the big 'chestnut dashed" away
from the struggling gelding, and it was a
relief to see Geero finally pull up and al
low Ccesceus to win the heat by a good
six lengths. Summary:

BERKELEY, Sept. 21.â The Berkeley
High School athletes won the Bay County
Athletic League field day held this after
noon on the University of California
cinder path. This is the first time the
local school has gained a victory for sev
eral years and it was over its old rival,
the Oakland High School, by.. the meager
score of one point.
The day was not one for record break
ing, although two weru lowered. A driz
zling rain fell at the beginning and end of.
the meet, wetting athletes and spectators
alike. In spite of the overcast sky a good
crowd attended and' remained until the
close. The women gathered on the bleach
ers under the trees at the north and were
protected from the worst of the weather.
The track was poorly policed and spec
tators crowded the oval, shutting off the
view of those on the Dleachers and hinder
ing the athletes. During the field events
the oval was packed.
The Central and Polytechnic high
schools and the Lick School of Mechanical
Arts were In the "'also ran" class, -for the
points they made were far below those of
Oakland and , Berkeley. The scores were
as follows: ' .-.'',. Â¦ ; . â¢
Berkeley, 59; Oakland, 58; Lick, 9; Polytech

Its score materially by giving it ten
polntH, as against Berkeley's (second) six
points. Stanley of Berkeley lowered- the
fifty-yard dash record, held by Llgda of
Oakland, from 5 4-5 seconds to 5 3-5 sec

D. J. O'Leary, grand president of tho
Young Men'B Institute, has named the
following district deputies for the order:
J. C. Stubbs has the appointment of thw
next general freight agent Who will ge;:
the post is not known at present. It hi
expected that Stubbs will wire the- ap
pointment in the next few days, as Shep
ard's resignation goes into effect on Â¦ the
1st of October. Under the rules of civil
service G. "W. Luce stands next In line for
promotion. â¢ -
Old officials say that Markham was
placed over Shepard on account of the
brusqe manner of the latter official when
dealing with patrons of the road. It is
said that complaints were numerous from
merchants, who charged that Shepard
was far from a Chesterfield in his manner
when they consulted him upon freight
rates.
Shepard said yesterday that his resig
nation was tendered because he was of
fered a more responsible position with the
Pacific Improvement Company in Vic
toria, B. r C. . This hardly seems correct ,
however, as a railroad man is not golni;
to resign a responsible position with a
large railroad corporation to go with a
much smaller concern unless he feels that
there is no prospect of promotion ahead
of him.
Tho resignation of A. D. Shepard as
general freight agent of the Southern
1'acltlc was tho chief topic among ra.Il
road men yesterday. AH sorts of rumors
were ufloat as to the cause of the resig
nation, the most general being that Shep
ard felt slighted at the action of J. C.
Stubbs In appointing C. H. Markham over
him.

District Deputies Are
LUCE MAY GET
THE POSITION
The incident Is recalled that, the con
vention rejected the proposition for a com
mittee to pass upon the qualification of
delegates. Boss Martin Kelly insisted
with vigor and clearness that the list of
delegates certified to by the Registrar of
Voters should be the roll of the conven
tion, and the delegates by a large major
ity voted .in favor of Kelly's motion..
Hints were thrown out that bosses rep
resenting certain factions were figuring on
a scheme to unseat two delegations, but
the proposition seemed, so raw and reck
! less that the politicians treated the rumor
as idle gossip. The appointment of a com
mittee to pass upon the qualification of
members may signify something . that is
not clearly understood by the convention.
â¢ A conference of politicians was held at
Mose Gunst's rooms yesterday afternoon.
Later in the day reports were circulated
that Auditor Wells would be an active
candidate for Mayor. Reports were also
circulated that A. ' Ruef and Martin Kel
ly had the convention - so tied up that
.Herrin. Dibble and Lynch could not safe
ly count on the execution of a programme.
The facts seem to be that the spirit of in
dependence has taken hold of a majority
of the delegates. It is not a sure thing
that John Lackmann.will have - a Â¦walk
over for Sheriff, although a bargain was

Thomas D. Rlordan, ghairman of the

announced* the appointment of the follow
ing committee on organization and order
of business:
The Local Situation.
Ills chief supporters hold that If the ex
pression Is not distinctly favorable he will
etlgnify a desire that his name shall not bo
presented to tho nominating convention.
In the light of recent comment tho Gov
ernor is likely to bo convinced that efforts
on his part to succeed himself as Gov
ernor will surely provoke ono of the
bitterest struggles In the history of thÂ«
Republican party of California. Tho oillca
of Governor is not the only prize In the
political lottery. The United States Scn
atorshlp Is an alluring berth, ami the
fact that a candidate htis served as Gov
ernor is no handicttp In the race. Senator*
Booth, Stanford and Perkins had guber
natorial honors before they were com
missioned to represent the State in the
United States Senate.
The next surprise In State politics may
be an announcement from Governor Gage
that he Is not a candidate for another
term. His closest friends- assert that,
while he has had the question of another
term under consideration, he has not
authorized any one to say that his name
will be presented to the Republican 8t.Ua
Convention as a candidate for rcnomlna
tlon. It is well understood that he is
anxious to elicit an expression of public
opinion touching the merits and policies of
his administration.
Locked in her bedroom. Mrs. Josephine
E. Blacow, widow of the late Arthur Bla
cow. ended her life with carbolic acid
yesterday afternoon at her residence on
the Blacow ranch, near Irvlngton. De
spondency because of ill health Is the only
reason the members of the family can
assign for the suicidal deed, but that does
not satisfactorily explain to the bereaved
relatives the strange and distressing act.
Mrs. Blacow waa n member of onu of
the prominent families of Alameda
County, and her death comes as a mattor
of great surprise to many who know her.
The Mrat disclosure concerning the aul
clde was uncovered by Mrs. Blacow'u
daughter. Miss Kmma Blacow. a teachor
at Centervllle High School. The yourus
lady returned from her day's work at n:3u
o'clock. Falling to find her mother at hor
accustomed place, preparing for the even
ing meal. MUs Blacow went outside and
looked about, but could not see anything
of the object of her search.
Then che went to her mother's bed
room. The door waa locked from the ln-
Blde. Fearing* that there was Bomethlnj?
wrong, tho alarmed young woman ran
acro88 the road and summoned her uncle.
Richard Blacow, whose residence was
Immediately opposite Mrs. Blacow's
place. He hastened to the hoube, broke
into the room and found his siBter-ln-law
dead on the bed, an empty vial labeled
"carbolic acid" resting on a table at the
head of the bed. The woman's lips were
badly burned from the poison.
Physicians were summoned, but they
could do nothing, for the despondent
woman must have been dead for some
time before her body was discovered.
Later the family learned that the poison
had been purchased by Mrs. Blacow at a
Centerville drug store.
The death was reported to Coroner
Mehrmann, who will hold an inquest on
Tuesday. The surviving members of the
family are the daughters, Miss Emma
Blacow and Miss Blanche B.lacow, the
latter being a teacher in the Mastlck
School at Alameda, and a son. J. R. Bla
cow, who has of late been employed as a
special clerk by the Board of Supervisors.
Mrs. Blacow's deceased husband was a
son of Robert Blacow, who settled in
Washington township In the early '50s,
where for many years he had a large
business importing merino sheep.

Dr. Charles A. Dukes, who attended
McGuire and performed the autopsy upon
his body, testified that the man had come
to his death from a blow inflicted upon
his head by some blunt instrument, -which
had produced cerebritis and death. The
skull had been fractured by the blow.
There were no other wounds.
A few minutes, after leaving McGuire,
Officer McGowan testified, they heard,
frightful screams, which appeared to
come from the direction which McGuira
had taken. They ran toward the spot in
company with two other officers whom
they had met and found McGuire lying in
the middle of East street, between How
ard and Mission. He waa almost uncon
scious, but was trying to regain bis feet.
They took him to the Emergency Hospi
tal, where, after treatment, he became'
conscious again. In reply to questions of
the officers he replied that he had
been struck by some men whom he did
not know, who had disappeared in the
darkness. He did not understand why ha
should have been struck by strikers when
he was a union man himself, being a
boiler-maker.
McGowan's story of the assault was
corroborated* by Officer Edner. He said
he saw the forms of men disappearing In.
the darkness when they ran to McGulre'3
assistance, but that it was impossible to
catch or distinguish them. He saw blood
trickling down the head and face of tho
wounded man.
Struck in the Dark.
McGulre was identified by omcers
James McGowan and J. T. Edner of the
San Francisco police force as the man
they had found lying unconscious in the
street on the- morning of September 6.
McGowan testified that he was in com
pany with Edner on that morning on the
water front. About 1 o'clock, they were
attracted by the heated words of two
men in an East-street coffee saloon. The
men were arguing the strike situatton.
After listening to the men for a while,
the officers separated them and ordered
them to go home. McGuire told the offi
cers that he had arrived that day from
Alaska on the ship Fresno and that ha
had relatives living- in Oakland and the
Mission. '/.-.Â¦.',Â¦.
Pound Unconscious by Policemen.
Witness Cumming said McGulre acted
stupidly for several days after his arrival
at hia house and four, days before his
death had relapsed into a comatose con
dition from which he did not recover.
The testimony of Mrs. Mary Cumming,
McGuire's sister, was corroDorative of -
that of her husband. She had not been
told as much of the assault, however, as
her husband, her brother having been
loth to inform her of any of the details.
James Cumming, the deceased's broth
er-in-law, at whose house he died, was
the tirst witness called by Coroner Alehr
mann. He testified that McUuire'cajne
to his home on the evening of September
b and made the statement to him. that ha
had been beaten by strikers In San Fran
cisco the ntcrh't before. McGulre had told
him that just after coming off the gang
plank of the ship Fresno at the Oregon
dock on tho previous evening he had
been attacked by four men, who beat him
on the head with some blunt instru
ment. The men had knocked him down,
he said, and pummeled him into insensi
bility. But for the timely arrival cf po
lice officers he would have been killed.
He had been taken to the Emergency
Hospital for treatment and released tho
next day, when he made his way to Oak
land.

Have you dandruff? Then you have
a contagious parasite disease, unpleasant,
unhealthy and one that will eventually
lead to baldness. To cure it you must
destroy the parasite that eats at the root
of the hair. The. only preparation for
destroying these germs Is Newbro's Her-
picide. Charles Klein of Laramie, Wyo..
Bays: Â¦ "Herplcide allayed the itching,
cured the dandruff and stopped my hair's
falling out; and it is bringing a new crcp
of hair." Herplcide is free from grease
or dangerous drugs, and makes hair glos-
sy and soft as silk. One bottle will con-
vince you of its merits.
In "Herpicide," the Hew Scientific and
Successful Dandruff Treatment.

"I may say that the alarm occasioned
the industries of Great Britain by Ameri

has not been exaggerated try the press. ]
believe myself that the competition most
feared by the English at the present time,
and rightfully so. is that of the Iron and

hand, England has so large and steady a
source of Income from our American trav

and those across the water will agree ul
timately that there is enough money In

their horses ft the outer limit of the
gulden in front ot thn dad,
The. weather was perfect for tha re
view. It waa cavil and occnslonallv there
worn it tow dronn of ruin. Haln had fatten
all night lone and the dust wan l^id,
.Mnally came several regiments of cul
rutwlers, Tho sun shone intermittently
and with curious effect on their breast
plates, which one moment looked to bo a
nut*a of dark blue ateol nnd the next
seemed uhlmmerlng silver. The bratÂ«a
hemlota nlno glittered like gold or turned
iv dirty yellow color, according as tho
tunahJnn. nmota them or the. clouds inter
cepted Its rays.
The Infantry was followed by the divi
sional artillery, twenty field guns afront,
the long slate-gray cannon 'being kept In
excellent alignment. After tho tlrst four
divisions of Infantry came the cavalry,
thirty-six regiments-solid brigades of a
thousand men each, thirty afront. First
cumo tho dragoons, carrying lances from
which lluttered red and white pennants.
They advanced at tho trot, headed by
trumpeters, who executed r funfare Reg

Heura in blue tunics with dark trimmings

Each division was preceded bv tho reRl

General Brugure nnd IiIh staff, reaching
trio front of tho dais. 1 saluted tho Presi

attaches took up a position facing the
dais, so that tho rest of the army passed
between the Czar nnd General Brugure.
General Andre, tho Minister of War, who
rodo with tho Czar to tho pavilion, sat In
thn front row of the tribune on the Czar's
left nnd followed tho march past, which
was almost faultless throughout In ltÂ«
mnchlne-likft precision, with a happy ex
pression, evidently proud of tho spectacle
he was offering to tho Czur.
Around the. review grounds was a deep
mass" of red anil blue Infantry, cavalry
and artillery. The wholo lino extended
several miles In spite of the fact thnt tho
troops were drawn up 150 Hies deep. Sud
denly, nt a given signal, thin vnst body
began to swing around, thus bringing tho
heml of tho lino across Ihe rovlow ground
nnd In front of the Oenr. Tho effect was

truck, and as the driver used the lash
many of them hooted and jeered him.
The special officer who accompanied him
stood at his post prepared to prevent any
attempt on tho part of a number of
strikers who were present to do any dam

teamster several police officers who were
sent from tho Central station appeared
and drove the crowd away.
Tho timely arrival of a strong posse ot

of atriKivs and th*lr sympathizers. The
special, scenting serious trouble, drew hla
revolver nnd threatened to shoot the first
man who attempted to offer vlnienco to
him or the teamster. Some citizen, evl
dentlv realizing that n clash between the
rlvnl forces was imminent, telephoned to
Captain Wlttman. The latter at once sent
Lieutenant Martin and a formidable, squad
to the scene, and with thu ntd of their
riubs they Boon dispersed the strikers.
One of the latter refused to move on and

7 HE mass-meeting in Metropolitan Temple was the feature of the strike situation yesterday, .The strikers were urged to stand firm, and union men at zvork were ex
horted to contribute liberally to tife strike fund. Father Yorkc asserted that the employers, of San Francisco ivere moved by Old World ideas, and they Â¦ were
forcing the contest because they wished the relation to be that of master and servant, not that of employer and employe.' He urged his hearers to see that iheir
money did not go into the coffers of the men who stood against them, whether merchants or ncivspaper publishers. Father Yorkc digressed from the strike question to
defend the Examiner against the storm of condemnation, aroused by the assassination of President William McKinlcy.' He expressed in effect his disapproval of the
Union Labor party. While asserting that striker^' violence was a newspaper phantom, he pleaded with the strikers not to weaken their cause by rioting and attacks upon
non-union men. â¢

Beecher stole a valuable lot of jÂ«welry
from Mrs. Amy Johnstone, with whom he
lodged on O'Farrell street. . He fed to
Portland,- where he was apprehended by
Detective Kyan a short time after the
theft was committed. He was brought
back here and tried on a charge of grand
larceny. In offering his- defense he> tried
to show that the jewelry was - given to
him by his landlady as a proof of her af
fection. Judge Dunne, in sentencing
Beecher, who is a young man, said that
it was customary in sentencing a man for
his first offense to deal lightly with him,
but that in this case he felt in duty bound
to take into account the prisoner's at
tempt to besmirch the character of the
woman whom he had robbed and would
therefore sentence him to eight years'
confinement, which is only two years less
than the limit for grand larceny. He
will go to the Folsom Penitentiary.
If Arthur Beech er had not been s:> anx
ious to besmirch the character of the
woman whom he robbed of jewels he
never would have received such a heavy
sentence as that given him by Judge
Dunne yesterday, and he would have es
caped the scoring which the jurist gave
him as he pronounced the sentence.

Slanders Woman He
Robbed.

The Financier says: It will be remembered
that the bank statement of the previous week
quite naturally failed to reflect the large pay
ments on September 12 of $8,479,678 for bonds,
these disbursements counting for only one dayâ
or say $1,413,279â In the bank averages. There
was, however, a balance of $7,066,399, repre
senting the remainder of those payments of
the 13thj which it would seem should have been
reflected, in the bank statement of last week,
instead of which â¢ It would appear that only
the payments for bonds purchased last week
were accounted for in the returns. It is scarce
ly likely that the banks would withhold from
their reported cash so Important an amount
as the $7,066,399 above noted.- The explanation
for its absence in the return may therefore be
that the corporations which sold bonds to the
Government were mostly savings banks and
that the money received by them for these
bonds was rather promptly Invested In" other
securities or temporarily deposited, awaiting a
favorable opportunity for Investment. Moreover,
some of the private bankers who sold bonds
have placed the cash in their own vaults. The
disclosures made by the preliminary estimate
of the movement of money last week, that the
ordinary operations of the treasury continue to
absorb large sums, of >money from the banks
and also that the movement of currency to the
interior appears to be Increasing, are not alto
gether assuring. There will, however, be no
occasion for anxiety regarding the situation so
long as the policy of bond purchases Is con.
tlnued, through which depleted bank reserves
may be partially restored. The money market
will soon be directly relieved through Imports
of gold from Europe and from- Australia and
also through Yukon gold, which will be trans
ferred to this center.

sales of S500 shares. Some degree of" support
was accorded after this, although ! the price
touched par during the second hour, an ex
treme decline of 7% from yesterday's close
and 3 points from the high level of the year
on June '7. The stock closed at 100%. a net'
loss of 6%. Selling for London account also
was a depressing factor, . where news of an
other setback in South Africa discouraged re
cent hopes of an early termination of the war.
Brisk bidding up of the local traction stocks
.was the only notable influence toward an ad
vance. Prices were generally below last
night's level when the bank statement ap
peared. The loan reduction, in spite of the
week's activity by -speculative â¢ poots in the
market, relieved some apprehension and al
lowed the surplus' reserves to derive additional
advantage from the gains of cash on the sub
treasury operations. The strength of the local
tractions and a lively demand for Louisville
ami Nashville and Union Pacific steadied the
market, but the close was Irregular and with
the day's net changes mixed.
The-rrice movement of stocks this week con
stituted a remarkable demonstration of con
fidence in the stability of the financial fabric
I and the continuance of prosperity. On
Monday, which was the first day of dealing
in stocks after the death of President Mc-
Kinley. prices recovered practically all the
losses of the week before, the market opening
with a buoyant up-rush of prices and clcsing
strong at the top level. This movement was
not less significant as a de .onstratlon of con
fidence because it was to some extent artificial
and due to manipulation. Artificial support is
powerless to check general selling by real
holders of securities, who act always on their
own conviction that the value of their shares
has become impaired. The action of the mar
ket on Monday morning showed conclusively
that there was no general liquidation tu be
faced. Real holders were confident in the
value of securities. The timid class of holders
had evidently done their selling during the
previous week at the threat of the calamity
which fell upon the market during Friday
night. The professional bears instead of Fee-
Ing prices dip so as to afford a profit on the
short sales saw a sudden rebound, which
forced them to buy back at a loss emphasizing,
the recovery by their bidding for stocks. Evi
dently the action of the market was a sur
prise to the whole speculative world. Com
mission houses had orders to buy at the mar
ket which represented the hopes of bargain
hunters that the opening drop ir> prices would
afford a price level that would make profitable
investments. These orders were executed at
prices from 3 to 6 points higher than the pre
vious Friday's closing. This condition of
affairs added to the enormous supporting rid
ers for account of great capitalists resulted
in the over-stimulation of the market. Many
brokerage houses also had had additional or
ders to buy*' at fixed prices below the market,
which would have proved an obstacle to any
fall. . These technical causes must not be lost
eight of in Justly estimating the manner of
the recovery, although they impair the signifi
cance of the fact. Undoubtedly the opportune
relief to the money market by the Treasury
measures was a dominant factor to steadying
the market and relieving the anxiety which
had become acute. A striking contrast is
afforded by the easing conditions of the money
market this week . and the daily conferences
last week of the clearing-house authorities and
the devising of measures to meet what had
reached the proportions of a crisis. The gain
in cash from the subtreasury has been aug
mented to many millions through the redemp
tion of Government bonds, the division of In
ternal revenue collections Into bank deposits,
the anticipation of October Government inter
est payments and the normal increase in pen
sion payments incident to the mid-monthly
period. Last week's loan contraction resulting
from the liquidation in the stock market also
Fenslbly relieved the position from the banks.
The importance of early Imports of gold has
somewhat diminished in view cf thia relief
from domestic sources, but the almost hourly
expectation of gold engagements has played
its part in sustaining th$ stock market. The
fact that exchange raids have not actually
reached the profitable gold Import point, al
though one small engagement was made, is
accounted for by the less urgent pressure for
money in New York. A movement of gold to
New York Is confidently anticipated, but ex
change authorities differ widely in their opinion
of the probable volume of the movement. The
amount of this country's unliquidated credit
balance abroad has grown debatable, owing
to- our large purchases of home securities from
foreign holders and large borrowings by
American syndicates from foreign capitalists.
The recent large receipts of Australian gold
which have found their way ultimately to New
York bank reserves cuts off a customary source
of supply for London, and in fact, represents
liquidation of London obligations to New
York, thus leadening future claims. The Ausi
tro-Hungary Bank continues to buy gold in
Kuropean markets for currency purposes: The
latest estimate of the Russian loan to be taken
at Paris is $200,000,000 and German capitalists
are floating a lesser loan for Russian railroads.
The present abundance of resources from the
European banks is therefore not to be counted
upon as freed from future large obligations.
It is therefore not impossible that money market
conditions may recur when the effect of the
Treasury measures of relief begins to be lost
a *Raiiroad bonds have recovered iri sympathy
with stocks but in much less degree.

Report on a New Telegraphic

as to enable sixteen operators to work
simultaneously on the same circut.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
â¢W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â Far more
satisfactory than any of its friends had
dared to hope for is the outlook for nego
tiations and the ratification of a new
Hay-Pauncef ote treaty between this coun
try and Great Britain covering the con
struction of an interoceanic canal. The
Call is authorized to say:
"The State Department is greatly en
couraged to believe that it will be able
to make* a treaty embodying all the ideas
agreed to by the Senate and at the same
time satisfactory to the President and to
Great Britain."
â¢ This statement means much, because
Secretary Hay has never been optimistic
regarding the success of the treaty after
it was laid aside by the Senate near the
close of the long session of Congress in
the spring of 1S00. . The subsequent amend
ment of the treaty last winter in such a
manner as to require the defense of the
canal by American fortifications, thus de
stroying the principle of neutrality, led to
the rejection of the convention by the
British Foreign Office. Since then the
work of negotiating a new treaty has
been actively under way.
Senators who had been hostile to the
first treaty partly because they had not
been consulted were all Interviewed and
their ideas obtained as to what they would
stand out for. Then there were long talks
between Secretary Hay and Lord Paunce
fote, the British Embassador, followed by
the departure of the latter for home to
consult his Government. What has hap
pened since that time has indicated that
speedy progress Trill be made.
Indeed, the impression given here is that
the British Government is assuming much
the same position that it occupied when
the first treaty was being drawn and that
it is showing â¢ a disposition to give the
United States everything it wants within
reason. There is high authority for the
statement that there is as. yet no draft of
the perfected treaty. The negotiations
Â¦that have- been in progress through the
summer have been confined to a series of
notes, and the document will not be put
in form until Lord Pauncefote returns to
this country. He will return next month,
and the .work of preparing the treaty will
at once begin, at the State Department.
All signs now point to the acceptance of
the treaty by the Senate. .
President Roosevelt will do everything
in his power to bring about this result.
SiJecial Dispatch to The Call,
The Times, wMle it has no misgivings
as to the final issue, accuses the home
authorities of lack of organized, .sustained
effort, of a disposition to postpone mili
tary for financial considerations and of
failure to grasp the moral and intellectual
damage which the prolongation of the
struggle inflicts upon the empire. Other
Ministerial supporters aver that precious
months which should have been sDent in
preparing for another campaign were
wasted in electioneering- and that Lord
Kitchener has not been supplied with the
requisites.
THE HAGUE, Sept. 21.-Baron von
Lynden, the Minister of Foregn Affairs,
has forwarded to the legations and mem
bers of the Council of the Court of Arbi
tration a copy of the Boer appeal for ar
bitration, with a notification that he in
tends to bring up the appeal for consid
eration at the first meeting of the Coun
cil. The date of the meeting is- not
fixed.
The Government's publication of these
reverses causes an outburst of exaspera
tion against the conduct of the war, not
in South Africa, but by the Ministry. The
creat Ministerial journals accuse the Gov
ernment of trying to run the war "on the
cheap" by not providing Lord Kitchener
with sufficient resources.
British. Are Indignant.
The situation is singruularly like the
opening of the war two years ago, the
names of the same places recurring in
the dispatches. Utrecht, where Major
dough was entrapped, was the scene of
a similar ambuscade eighteen months
back. Acton Homes, where the Boers yes
terday reappeared, is eighteen miles
southwest of Ladysmith, prominent in the
early hostilities, and the Xatal Colonials
are mustering- for the defense of the Tu
pela. as when General Joubert invaded
Natal in 1S99. In Cape Colony fighting is
again going on south of Stormberg, in ter
ritory traversed by raiders and their pur
suers half a dozen times.
While Kruger and Dr. Leyds are draw
ing up petitions to President Rdosevelt
and tne Czar, asking them to intervene,
the Pghting Boers are helping themselves
in South Africa by, celebrating the expira
tion of "the period in which lx>rd KUchener
proclaimed they must surrender, by lour
notable successes, killing sixty-eignt of
ficers and men, wounding sixty-three and
capturing five guns and three hundred
men.
Whence Come the Horses?
Where, too, do the Boers get their
horses? The number which the Britisn
are reported to have captured during
even the last six or eigtit months is enor
mous, yet the Boers seem still to have no
lack of remounts. One would imagine the
world did not contain such a large supply
of horseflesh as has been us'etl up during
the present war, for horses cannot be
made in a comparatively brief period like
ammunition. â¢ â¢ . â¢ _ ..
This news was- in two separate : dis
patches from .Lord Kitctiener, reporting'
surprises and defeats inflicted .by Boers'
on the British forces,.. showing how the
Boers arÂ« determined, more than ever,
perhaps, to tight to the bitter end. That
they are far Irom being done yet is evi
dent to every ordinary man.
Xothing in connection with the war has
been racne amazing than tne manner in
which tne Boers are abie to keep uptneir
euppiy of ammunition. If. one considers
the extraordinary amount of this wnich
has t>een tired oif since the start of the
war and recalls the millions of rounas
which, according to war correspondents,
axe being captured well nigh daily when
no single cartridge has been supposed tu
make its way into tne country irom .out-
Bide sources since the start of the war,
one cannot but think it, to say tne least,
rather curious if not amazing.
LOKDOX, Sept.' 21.â Following: the ex
piration of the time left to the. Boers .for
surrender after- Lord .Kitchener's proc
lamation, the news which arrived from,
London on Tirursday rather tended to'
divert public attention from the last sad.

the town is doomed. Every man, woman
and child still in the place is fighting- the

sentenced by a court-martial to five >ears
for defrauding the Government. The
Judge reserved his decision.
. Representative Livingstone of Georgia
was especially pleased with his reception.
The Georgia Representative had con
gratulated the President, had expressed
tho hope that his administration would, be
a success, and had informed him that as a
Southern man and a Georgian he would
contribute everything in his power to that
end. The President replied: that it would
be hJs aim to be the ' President of ' the
whole people, without regard to geograph-
Ica. lines or class distinction; that it was
the welfare of all which he should seek
to promote. ' . . Â¦ . Â¦ ' . v
- The President was even more emphatic
To the Minnesota . Representatives the
President recalled the fact that it was in
their 1 State he had made his last . public
utterances as .Vice President, and that in
that "confession of faith," as he charac
terized it, he committed himself to the
policy of McKinley, to which he pledged
his adherence upon assuming the respon
sibilities of his office at-Buffalo. :

Among them were" Senators Scott and

ard of North Carolina, Millard of Ne
braska and Burton of Kansas, and Repre
sentatives Heatwole, McCleary and
Stephens of Minnesota, Gibson of Ten
nessee, Livingstone of Georgia and Day
ton of West Virginia. All were delighted
with the reception accorded them. Sen
ators Elkins and : Scott congratulated the
President upon the decision he had made
when he took the oath of office: â¢Â¦ ;
'T?hat simple declaration," said Senator
Scott,. "immediately restored confidence in
the business, world." . â¢ â¢ .
Secretary Hay and Secretary Gage came
almost upon his heels and saw the Presi
dent for a few minutes in the Cabinet
room. The doors of the White House
were closed to the public, but admission,
of course, was accorded to those who de
sired to see the President personally, and
within an hour a score of men prominent
in public life had called to pay their re
spects and to extend their good wisnes for
a successful administration.

organization of the present bank under a
new name with an increased capital of

ing for all three of the Southern men.
'The Democratic newspapers are predict
ing for you success, and the feeling of all

"I am going: to be President of the
United States, and not any section," re
plied the President. "I don't care for
sections or sectional lines. When I was
Governor of New York I was told I
could make four appointments In the
army. When I sent in the names there
were three from the South and the other
from New York. '.They -were brave men,
who deserved recognition for. services in
the Spanish war, and it did not matter
what States they were from."
-..The President talked . in the same vein
with Senator Money of Mississippi when
the latter called. Senor Quesada and Gen
