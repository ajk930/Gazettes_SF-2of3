Cabinet Officers Arrive.
Most of the Cabinet oflicers as they ar
rived at the depot were accompanied by
members of their families, who came to
bid them good-by. Secretary Cortelyou
was early on hand, and ushered, the
guests to their apartments in the train. >
Among the first arrivals was Secretary,
Hay, who drove up in a wagonette. He
was accompanied by his wife and daugh
ter and his son, Adelbert Hay.' The party
was greeted quite warmly; by the>waiting
crowd, and there was some cheering. Â¦
One by one the carriages the Cabinet 1
officials drove up to the station and dis
charged their occupants.- The passage .of
each party from the doorway to the train
was the signal for applause, from the
crowd. As the minutes passed enthusi
asm rose and cheers grew more. and more
hearty. The great throng which filled the
station, and through which a lane ' was
made for the Presidential party, to: pass,"
greeted also with .'cheers various; distin
guished men who had come to bid; the
President good-by. Lieutenant .General
Miles, handsome and soldierly of bearing,
attracted great attention and drew forth
enthusiastic cheers as he * came through'
the finest cars that money and akill and
taste could' produce; with ten thousand
miles of; open track before him, and his
train ; given way over everything on the
road; with millions of people waiting to
see him and to cheer him*; with thousands
of * miles of broad prairie, ! of wooded
mountains, scarred ' and snow-capped
peaks, green and fertile valleys and the
.surf-beaten sands of the Pacific for him
"to see," and the unrestrained enthusiasm
of a /people usually undemonstrative,
swirling round his head and following on
with him on his journey, it was no wonder
Jhe President felt satisfied and that all
things augured well. - . - < â¢Â¦
At Charlottesville.
. r It was time to start when the President
boarded the train. His flag buttered from
the engine, the train men were at. their
posts, every > one who was going was on
board arid - McKinley' s word that he was
ready, was all that .was Iackini. He kept
no one waiting, and within a minute after
he was on board the train commenced to
move from' the depot. As it did "so a mighty
shout went'' up from inside the station
building 1 and- from the' thousands that
filled . the â¢ surrounding streets, and in a
whirl of dust and a great wave of enthu
siasm the President's special started on
its long journey into- the West.

WASHINGTON*. D. C. April
29.â With the cheers of ten
thousand people ringing in
his ears, the President
started on his westward
Â¦;-.: tour this morning. -The
derot was thronged by a crowd eager to
see and to bid him good-by and godspeed,
and ih<> people gathered about him when
he stuped from his carriage until' he could
hardly force his way through them to
the status of his car. Â¦ â¢ .......
}iÂ« reached the station, but a few mo
ments before the scheduled time for the
start. Every one else was already on the
train and it was only waiting for the
President and his immediate party. A
number of friends drove down to the sta
tion to bee thÂ»Â» President away -on his
Journey and they joined the people'surg
ing around the train and lent their own
farewells to those of the crowd. ..â¢
Mrs. McKinley was escorted to the cars
by Dr. Rixey. upon whose arm she leaned
cis the President made his way from the
<_arriage to the train.
As soon as they were on board McKiri-
Iey stepped out on the rear platform,
while Mrs. McKinley took her scat at one
of the windows, and as the train drew
slowly out the President and his wife
bowed their acknowledgments to the
enthusiastic cheers and hat wavings that
testified to the esteem cf the people.
The train wait scheduled for a start at
30:20 o'clock. The cars had been brought
out from the Pullman s'hops where they
had been refitted and refurnished for the
trip, and had been standing on a siding
i:i the train yards. When they were rolled
into the station building there was already
quite a crowd of people who, determined
to miss none of the going away, had come
early to see everything that happened.
Ko one was allowed to enter the train ex
cept those of the Presidential party and
their friends, and some of these gained
entrance to the Olympia, the President's
private car, acd decorated the rooms with
flowers. Roses and smilax and violets"
transformed the little apartments into
veritable bowers, and the scent .of the
blossoms flavored the air with a touch of
spring. And th-^n the other cars were deco
rated until the train resembled a flower
garden. :
About a half hour before the start
the members of the party began to arrive.
They came in ones and twos and throes,
with secretaries and porters and coach
men and baggagemen, -with trunks and
parcels and hampers and valises, for. al
though everything possible had been done
to have the property of the party safely
en board in good time before the start,
etill late baggage is proof against, any
rule, and traveling without handtatchels
Is oat of the question.
ooarfl arrived at Charlottesvllle on'
schedule time. The run from Washing
ton was made without incident. A brief
stop was made at Alexandria. A big
crowd had assembled at the station and
the President and Mrs. McKinley Â¦ ap
peared on the T>latform to make salutes.
Speeding- through Virginia to this town,
I famous as the seat of the University of
Virginia. and the home of Jefferson, peo
"ple -gathered at every town, .village and
cross , roads to see the train go bv. At
Manassas, Culpepper and Orange the
-drowds Were ' especially large. As the
train approached Charlottesville the
party had a glimpse of the old home of
! President Madison '. at MontDelier. The
I pillars of the old mansion, were plainly
discernible through the trees. At Char
lottesville there was an immense as
semblage at the station. The stu
dents lined up alongside the Â»ralri and
gave the President three rousing cheers
and a tiger when he made his appearance.
From .the platform of his car the Presi
dent spoke as follows: -.. â¢. --:*"".
'.."It. gives me very. great. pleasure to re
ceive the greeting- of the people of* Char
lottesville and the cheers of the young
men of the University of Virginia. (Ap
plause.) Your institution la linked with
great men and great deeds and has in
fluenced both.'.- (Applause.) What an ar
ray of immortal names Virginia holds in
her keeping- to demind us of lofty patriot
ism, broad statesmanship and noble
achievements. (Applause.) To no other
State of the American Union belongs such
history to preserve- and cherish and such
examples to inspire and emulate. (Great
applause.) May the young men of the
State of Virginia prove worthy sons of
their noble ancestors and contribute in
the future as they did in the past to the
well being and honor and glory of the
republic. (Great applause.) Let me as
sure you, young gentlemen, that the
present and the future hold rich rewards
for good scholars "and 1 the wish which I
leave with you is that of these you may.
have your full share." (Prolonged ap
plause.) .
There were calls for Secretary Hay, but
his only response was to introduce Post
master General Smith, Who spoke briefly.
In the city of Lynchburg; the home of
Senator Daniel, there was a stop of ten
minutes. Senator Daniel, Mayor G. W.
Smith, members of the Board of Trade
and City Council and : a great crowd
greeted the party with old-fashioned Vir
ginia-enthusiasm. Senator Daniel mads
a brief speech of welcome to which the
President' responded.

the last campaign he made. his first ap
pearance as a candidate and by a vigor
ous campaign he beat Henry C. Dibble,
one of the strongest candidates for the
Assembly from any of the city districts.
His record in. the Legislature was clean
and creditable, and he returned to his dis
trict with every prospect of being offered
further honors.
In the new firm he will be associated
with.. E. .S. Pillsbury. It has for some
time been the purpose of Mr. Pillsbury to
establish a branch of his business In Ma
nila, and when Mr. Sutro was offered and
had accepted the- position of resident part
ner there, the firm was formed at once.
Mr. Pillsbury represents clients who are
seeking investment wherever possible, and
it is more than probable that Mr. Sutro
will soon be entrusted with the large
business interests which the i firm will
care for.
If the climate will permit him, Mr. Sutro
will remain in the Philippines , for six
years at least. He hopes in that time to
be able, to establish the firm on q. solid

The track was fast. Not less than 25,000
persons saw His Eminence in the classic
event, for every place of vantage around
the grand stand fo. which humanity could
cling was utilized. In the' betting ring
there was a jostling, surging crowd, and
the eighteen books did a' rushing business.
Alard Scheck, by ,hls work-out Friday,
was favorite, and when. the odds of. 7 to 10
were first chalked up money came in.at
such a lively rate that- the books, could
not handle it. But it, is doubtful if all
the books auit winner on the race,. for
leads of money went in on His Eminence
at 5 to 2. The contingent from the Blue
Grass section of the State came down
prepared to back San Nazarro, and they
put their money up In goodly quantities.
On the second attempt the' horses got
away on even terms. Down the stretch
they came toward the grand stand and a
length did not separate the five colts, with
His Eminence In front, Driscoll second,
Alard Scheck ; third, San Nazarro fourth
and Amur last. When they. straightened
out on the back stretch Wingfield" was
hugging the rail, still a length in the
lead; Alard Scheck had moved up to sec
ond Dlace and was a half length in front
of Amur, who was about the same dis
tance from San Nazarro and Driscoll,
who were moving down the back stretch
on even terms. As they reached -the
three-quarter pole Jockey -Woods loos
ened his rein and i called on the Schorr
entry to overtake His Eminence, but the
Memphis horse was not equal to it," for
little by little he fell back, and as they
entered the stretch San Nazarro had
moved up into second place, followed by
Driscoll, and AJard Scheck was left to
fight It out with Amur.' "His Eminence!"
was the Joyous shout that went up from
thousands when the Falsetto reached the
seven-eighths pole, running with long,
even strides. San Nazarro made the final
effort, but it was of no avail, for His
Eminence was under the wire a length
to the good, with San Nazarro half a
length In front of Driscoll,. Amur fourth
and a length away, with Alard Scheck,
the favorite, last by three lengths. Sum

Sandtrson, a Santa Fe freight brakeman,
was hurled to almost instant death in the
yards at Barstow, shortly after 1 o'clock
this morning, and the conductor on the
train escaped the same fate by a hair*s

pass. While the two men were standing
on the track, several freight cars that
v.tre being switched, backed toward them.
Because of the roar of the approaching

J. H. Sanderson Loses His Life in the
Santa Fe Yards at
SAX BERNARDIXO, April 29.â From
the public schools at Ontario, thence to a
cell in the San Bernardino County Jail
and later to the Whittier Reform School,
all within a week, is likely to be the novel
experience of ' 'Willie Fuller, aged 13;
Charlie Stover, aged 14; Eddie Bristol,
aged 17, and Everett Swanton, aged 15.
All are of , prominent families of North
Ontario. Last Thursday at noon the
quartet cast their school books aside and
decided to strike outfor San Diego, where
they expected to join the navy. Not
having money for expenses, they appro
priated a horse and buggy from a rancher
named Corker. They started without the
knowledge of friends or relatives and
their sudden disappearance stirred up the
entire town. On Saturday, however,
their theft became known and officers in
surrounding towns .were notified.
The boys were apprehended yesterday
seventeen miles southeast of Santa Ana,
traveling rapidly toward San Diego with
the stolen property. Sheriff Lacy made
the arrest and notified Constable Murphy
of Ontario, who brought his youthful
prisoners to jail here to-night pending pre
liminary examination. All four young
sters expressed a desire to be committed
to the Whittier Reform School and their
request will be granted.

WOUND FROM A SAW
EXPOSES HIS HEART
The Indians came down to Naas while
the Tees was there and left again the
next day with the Methodist missionary,
who would make a complete examination.
The Indians said the derelict came float-
Ins into Reynolds Inlet. The stumps of
her masts were standing only a few feet
above the decks and her houses had been
almcst completely washed overboard.
Several miles away Indian fishermen were
reported to have found bodies of one of
the supposed officers of the ship and an
other man and much wreckage
washed up.
The ship had evidently but recently been
in a storm, for some of her gear was still
hang-ing- over the side, a fact which is
probably rather against connecting her
with the Andrada. If she is not the
latter vessel she must have been a
coasting ship, for unless she was caught
Sn the storm within a hundred miles of
the west coast of Vancouver or the
Queen Charlotte Islands, she would cer
tainly have been driven south by the cur
rents and . would go farther away from
the Alaskan ccasst all the time.
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 29.-The
wreck of what is supposed to be the ship
Andrada, which disappeared from the
mouth of the Columbia River more than
four months ago, has been found lying off
a bay in the Queen Charlotte Islands. In
dians reported the floating In of the
strange vessel to Captain Gunns of the
steamer Tees, which arrived here to-day.
Some of the Indians said she was a
wooden ship, while others were equally
sure that she was iron. The fact that
they could not tell her name shows that
they were uncertain as to her build, but
from the general description given the
officers of the Tees, It is not impossible
that she is the missing boat from the Co
lumbia River bar.

Government has leased . Darrell's Island,
one of the largest islands ;in the- sound

spected, but up to April 24 no definite set
tlement has been made in regard to it. '
The army officials are, as usual, very
reticent, but as the blacksmiths in town
have been sounded asÂ» to their ability to
construct several hundred yards of iron
fenced very strong, close, high and with
spike points, and as the pians which one

DOLAU FAMILY EVICTED
FKOM MISECRAKLE HOVEt.
Officers Find Mother Intoxicated and
Children in Terrible Condition
of TJncleanliness. . ...
The family of Mike Dolan,- consisting of
a wife and six children, was evicted from
the miferable dwelling at 33 Victor street
yesterday afternoon. The father was ab
sent en one of bis daily sprees, and the
other members of his family were lying
around outside the house when the rase*
was reported to Secretary White of the
Society for tha Prevention of Cruelty to
Children-
Mr. White at once took steps to care for
the children, the eldest of whom Is II
years of age and the youngest an infant
In arms. The mother was .Intoxicated,
and when told that she was to be separat
ed from her children she exhibited no con
cern except for the baby which" she rather
preferred to keep. She admitted that she
had no place in which to spend the night,
but she guessed that she could take care
of the child, which was recovering from
an attack of the measles.
One child was wallowing in the refuse
beneath the house and another, alarmed
at the presence of the strangers, fled and
could not be found afterward.
The unnatural mother was taken shriek
ing to the police station, surrounded by
her -walling children.
The neighbors say that the Dolans are
intoxicated wnenever they have money,
and that the children are allowed to run
wild. Last December the woman was
treated at the hospital for a broken leg
as a result of a fight with her husband.
She was . also blind for . two weeks from
the effects of a kick said to have been
administered by Dolan in another con
flict.-. Secretary White will apply for let
ters of guardianship for the children.
METHOD OF PROCEDURE
IN BONDS ELECTION
City Attorney Advises Supervisors
Not to Levy Taxes Before
Their Issuance. "
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion yes
terday with the Board of Supervisors re-
yarding the proceedings necessary to call
for a bond election for hospital, schools
and sewers and for park extension by ac
quisition of lands. Lane advises the
board to first obtain plans and specifica
tions which shall be sufficient to indicate
the probable cost of the contemplated im
provements. An ordinance must be
passed determining that public interest
requires the construction and acquisition
of each improvement desired. At the
next meeting another ordinance must be
adopted by the affirmative vote of four
teen members, calling an election and
providing for the submission to the elec
tors of the proposition to issue a bonded
indebtedness for each purpose concerned
each to be embraced in a separate propo
sition so that it may be voted upon sep
arately.
The date and place of payment shall be
designated in the bonds and the rate of
interest to be paid must also appear in
the notice of election, as also the amount
of the tax levy to be made for the pay
ment. The opinion, which further holds
that it Is unnecessary to make a provi-"
sion In the tax levy prior to the issuance
of bonds, concludes:
The charter under the construction placed
thereon in the Fritz case provides for a means
of acquiring Dark lands by purchase. As to
the rleht of condemnation for that purpose It
is conferred by section 1238 of the Civil Pro
cedure Code as amended this year.
All the propositions may be submitted at
the came special election, but they should
be submitted as separate, distinct propositions
and sesrreB'ated no that they will in no ; wise
be Interdependent. The sewer system should be
submitted as a whole; the hospital as a sep
arate proposition.- It would be manifestly im
practicable to submit each schoolhouse item
and each of the contemplated repairs " to the
several schoolhousea as a separate proposition
in each Instance. The entire school matter
may, therefore, be submitted In one proposi
tion. As to the several park properties, in
case you determine upon more than . one, â¢Â¦ I
think It safest to , provide for each as a sep
arate proposition. Â¦

nia the news of the start of
: the Presidential train has set
preparations for McKinley's
. L welcome astir. In every town
upon his route through the
State preparations have been going on
more or less rapidly for some days if
not weeks, but now jhat he has actually
started, the hurry and it;pile has re
doubled and every effort ix be!ns made
to make sure t!:i>. nettling wai 'oe lack
ing when the i.i.T:o vN.n:.->. And this is
particularly so hi Pi:: Truncisco, which
is the objective jroir : <t t'-Je trip.
Yesterday morr.ir;.- h.;v work started
on the streets, i;i the ferry building, in
the Hoj)kins Institute of Art, in the Pa
vilion and everywhere that the President
will be received. Linesmen were hard at
work stringing wires across Market
pireet and Third and Kearny, and by last
evening they were far enough for the
men with the lamps to commence work.
Bel'ore two more days have passed most
cf the lamps will be in place and then
a day or two before the President will
reach the city workmen will commence
to string the garlands of gTeen and place
the palms and branches along: the route
of the great parade.
In the ferry building: carpenters are
measuring- distances for fences designed
to g-uide crowds up and down the great
nave with the least possible confusion.
The police are overhauling their posts
and ropes so as to have them in readi
ness to stretch along the sidewalks before
i he time for the parade. Janitors are at
work at the Pavilion and in the Hopkins
Art Institute, giving an extra polish or
an extra bit of paint or an extra cleaning
to the rooms where honored guests will
lie received, and everywhere where the
President and his party will go prepara-
P>r the gTeat event are absorbing
ition.
Presidential Salutes,
resident will be saluted once from
the bay, the salute being fired from three
v.arthips lying: off the lower city front.
It will be when he passes down the bay
tni his way to the Union Iron Works to
witness the launching. The saluting
ships will probably be the Wisconsin,
lov.a and Philadelphia. If the Iowa can
not come down from the north then one
of the vessels now at the navy-yard at
Mare Island will take her place. The
plan is to hare the vessels salute with
their heaviest guns and if that be car
ried out the twelve-inchers of the Iowa
and Wisconsin should thunder out a right
riotous welcome to the President. He is
entitled to the national salute of twenty
one guns and Jf it be fired from the big
twelves it should make noise enough for
a" week.
- It has not J>een decided what boat will
"caYry the President to the launching;" but'
it will probably be the McDowell, the
quartermaster's steamer, that plies be
tween the army posts on the bay. While
the President Is here the transport tug
Siocum will be always at his disposal, but
as the Siocum has but one single cabin, it
is thought she will not accommodate all
ihe party that will accompany him to the
Union Iron Works. The McDowell has
plenty of cabin room, however, for as
large a party as will be made up.
All Knights in Line.
The Knights Templar are arranging a
grand parade as part of their reception to
the President on Friday, May 17. The
President will be their guest from 2:30
until 5 o'clock. It is proposed to have
the commanderies assemble at the
asylums and march to the Palace Hotel,
where the President will be met and es
corted to the Pavilion, where the reception
will be held. It will be strictly an affair
for Knights Templar in uniform and for
their ladies and the doors will be closed
tc all else.
The two local commanderies , California
and Golden Gate, are in charge of the af
fair and committees from both have been
appointed to look out for the details. The
officers of Calif ornia Commandery are Emi
nent Commander Sir W. II. F. Titus, Gen
eralissimo Sir Carroll Cccik and Captain
General Sir Henry Ream. The officers of
Gcldtn Gate Commandeiy are Eminent Sir
Robert McMillan, Generalissimo Sir Harry
D. Loveland and Captain General Sir Rob
ert IX Moore. The two local commander
ies will turn out nearly three hundred
each and with them will be in the line
the commanderies from Oakland, San
Jose, Santa Rosa, Sacramento, Petaluma
and representatives from others in towns
lax: her away. It is expected that the
nuir.ber of knights in line will reach nine
hundred or a thousand, and the order has
gone forth that each must be in full uni
form or he will not be allowed to take
part in the reception. Grand Commander
McKee, commander of the Knights Tem
plar of California, will lead the parade.
The ladies of the Ohio Society have
completed arrangements for the banquet
they will give to the ladies of the Ohio
and Presidential parties â¢while the men
are dining the President and the gentle
men of both parties.. The banquet will be
given in the California Hotel. The ques
tion of haw many ladies will come with
the two parties is the only one of import
ance now affecting the linai ordering of
the dinner.
At afl executive meeting of the Ohio
Indies' Society it was decided to estab
lish the headquarters of the society at
the California Hotel. All communica
iiens concerning the reception of the
Presidential party with which the society
is connected should be addressed there.
The society has received an acceptance
from the ladies in the party of the Gov
ernor of Ohio of the invitation to the
i-iinciact to be given by the society.
Governor Henry T. Gage arrived from
the South yesterday, accompanied by Mrs.
Gage, and will be in. the city a day or
two. He has made no plans of his own
for meeting President McKinley at Ked
iands, but has signified his readiness to
curry out such plans in . this respect as
the - executive committee on the reception
of tbe President may adopt.
CHINESE ALSO
MAKING READY
to Say_ of Coming Wel
come to the President
What the Local Paper Has
The local Chinese paper, Mon Hing Got
Bo, has this to ray about the coming of
McKinley:
President McKinley will bt here about the
15th day of next month.
He is the one man of supreme authority In
the land and will be for four years to come.
During- that time many occasions will arise
Â¦when It will be necessary for him to decide
upon points in which the Chinese people are
Interested. fiSV
It ; would . b* ; â¢ graceful compliment . to the
President, and one which he would remember
with pleasure, if the Chinese residents and
merchants should decorate their quarter of
the city w^th the -.artistic lanterns and bari
r.ers which so delight the eyes of all Ameri
cans, and especially tourists, to whom they
have the added charm of novelty.
A little expense and, a little effort on the
part of sach person would make a. very pretty
display and would go far to correct the wrong
impression that is usually given to tourists
by guides, who show the very worst parts of
the quarter.
The Eastern visitor never sees the better
class of houses or anything else than the sur
roundings of the unfortunate, and these are
taken as a sample of the whole.
President McKinley has shown already an
unusual fairness in dealing with affairs in
China, and in appreciation of this and of the
further benefits which will accrue to San
Francisco through an increase of trade with
the kingdom across the ocean. It will be well
to create the very best impression possible on
our great visitor.
The committee which has in charge the mat
ter of preparing for the President's reception
Â¦win spend nearly $30,000 on decoration and en
tertainment. v
No such sumâ not even a twentieth part of it
âwould be required to make the Chinese quar
ter appear* a perfect fairyland. The majority
of people have the same large lanterns and
other decorations that have been used before
and a small expense for hanging and illumin
ating them would be all that would be re
quired.
Everything- which tends to increase the cor
diality of relations between America and
China will help the rapidly growing trade be
tween San Francisco and Chinese ports, and
it is to be hoped that if possible the members
of the Chinese Six Companies will devote
their attention to making some arrangements
for welcoming President McKinley.

SALT LAKE, April 29.â President Mc-
Kinley will be the guest of United States
Senator Kearns during his visit here Sun

cordance with the President's wishes no
formal programme for his entertainment
will be arranged for Sunday. On Monday
morning the President, Mrs. McKinley
and the members of the Cabinet will be
driven to points of interest in and about

of people opportunity to see the Presi
dent than would have been possible at a
public reception.
To Speak in Kansas City.
KANSAS CITY, April 29.-President Mc-
Kinley will deliver a speech in Conven
tion Hall during his stay in Kansas City
on his way home from the Pacific â¢Coast,
according to E. M. Clendenning, secretary

committee on entertainment that has just
returned from Washington. Mr. Clenden
ning says that the President personally

for the occasion.
Degree for McKinley.
BOSTON, April 29.-At a meeting of
overseers of Harvard University to-day
the question of granting the degree of
doctor of laws to President McKinley
was taken up informally, and the senti
ment expressed was unanimously in favor
of the step. The matter will come up for
formal action ;n June.

will stop but five minutes; at others more

minutes, and' others again will have half
hours and ( hours; and there are others,
too, that wil catch only the shrill whistle
of the train and the flash of its brilliant
cars as they whizz by, and the cloud of
dust whirling behind. But all the same
the town that will have but five minutes
is as enthusiastic as those with a day
or more, and the shorter the time the
more the town . hopes td crowd into it.
There will be -great examples of hurry
up welcomes and high' pressure greetings
in California for the days of the Presi
dent's stay, for every effort will be made
to adhere strictly to the time table that
has been submitted to McKinley and ap
proved by him. The rain will be given a
clear track for miles ahead and the right
of way over everything that runs on
wheels, so there is no reason ; just now
apparent why. the schedule should not be
carried out.
proach these will be thrown open. A Pres
idential salute will be fired on the arrival
of the President.
The school children of the county, num
bering several thousand, will be here. Two
blocks will be reserved for the children
and their teachers. Each pupil will be
provided with a small flag and bouquets
of flowers, which will be strewn in fr.ont
of the President's carriage.
A novel feature will be the Forest Re
serve Rangers In full equipment assem
bled on the sidewalk. Supervisor Slosson
has been assigned a place on California
street for these men. The students of the
Casa de Piedra School will participate.
The fraternal organizations have also
been invited. Every person will wear a
carnation, the President's flower. The
population of Ventura County will be out
en masse.
It Will Show the President
What a Harvester Looks
Like While at Work
STOCKTON WILL
HAVE A NOVELTY
STOCKTON, April 29.-When President
McKinley and his distinguished party vis
its Stockton during his swing around. the
circle the tourists will be given an op
portunity to see at least one item out of
the ordinary in the way of entertainment.
To this end it is proposed to have a large
combined harvester drawn by a big trac
tion engine in full operation at some point
in the suburbs of the city.
If the harvest is advanced there Is one
point just outside of the city where the
big outfit, similar to those used on the big
wheat farms, can be put In full operation,
and if no threshing can be done the ma
chinery will be put In full motion any
how. It is figured that the Eastern states
men will appreciate this scene. As the two
hours to be spent here are too brief a
time for any elaborate entertainment an
endeavor will be made to make the short
visit as interesting as possible.
There will be no public reception and all
of the people will be given a chance to.
see the chief magistrate during his drive
over a fixed route. The school children
of the city will be drawn up in the three
public parks and will salute the Presi
dent with the national anthems. The city
is already bestirring itself in anticipation
of the visit. No general decorations will
be attempted, but an additional $1000 has
been appropriated to put the streets in a
cleanly condition.
The city officials and the Chamber of
Commerce will co-operate in the enter
tainment. The preliminary work is al-
ready-being done and the full programme
will be announced next week.

attended Smith said that the appearance

Since the annual twenty-five-mile bi
cycle road race on Washington's birth
day there has been much discussion in
cycling circles as to the standing of
Walter J. Davidson, one of the crack rid
ers of the Bay City Wheelmen. The
statement has been openly made that he
was no longer a member of the club. In
view of that statement the board of di
rectors of the Bay. City Wheelmen have
issued the following:
The board, of directors of the Bay City
Wheelmen desire to state that Walter J.
Davidson has been for the past four years
and now is a member of this club, and
owinsr to an unauthorized statement to the
contrary which has recently been made,
deem-- It necessary to correct said false
impression. Mr. Davidson is an honored,
member of the club, and has always been
continuously since he Joined.
The foregoing, with the statement of
Mr. Davidson himself that he still be
longs to the club, is expected to set at
rest all rumors, to the contrary.

Gardner and McGovern later called on
the club's physician, Dr. W. C. F.idenmul-
Both donned ring costumes and took up
fighting positions before the camera.- They
eyed each other narrowly and chaffed each
other somewhat, but withheld fighting for
another time. Â¦
"I â¢ never saw you looking so fine,
Oscar." said Terry with a side step that
brought him closer to Gardner. They
both led with their rights and warmly
shook hands. In reply to Gardner's polite
query about his health, McGovern said he
was "finer than silk."
. "Hello, Oscar," he said.- Gardner came
back with the same greeting and the
honors were easy.
McGovern made the first lead
Charley White in the ring, as the only
man he knew in this city capable of filling;
the position was Harry Corbett. Gardner
then said, "Well, Corbett is agreeable to
me," and Harris replied that he suited
him. Word was' then sent to Corbett,
who demurred at first, but at last con
sented to act. â¢ . -
Gardner and McGovern met in a photo

Bushnell's and posed before the camera
in the costumes they will wear in the
ring to-night. Both expressed pleasure at
meeting each other and commented on
each other's appearance.

Alec Greggains,, manager of: the San
Francisco Athletic" Club, 'feels certain
that his request for a fight permit will be
granted by the Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors on Thursday after
noon. If it is granted there is'every pos
sibility that the ring-goers of the West
â¢will have an opportunity of seeing Fitz
simmons and Champion Jim Jeffries battle
in this city on July 4. Ned Homan is now
in the East' negotiating with Fltzsim
mons, and there is every probability that
the men will hold their second meeting
here.
Greggains yesterday denied : the story
that the National Club had secured Jef
fries' signature to box under its auspices.
He said that Billy Delaney, who is look
ing after the champion's interests, Is to
meet him this evening and arrange a bat
tle to be fought before the San Francisco
Athletic Club. Delaney is recuperating at
Campbell, Santa Clara County, but has
written to Greggains saying that he would
be at the McGovern-Gardner fight- this
evening. 'Â¦'Â¦ ., -'
It is the plan of the fight promoters to
bring off a championship battle at one of
the local ball grounds in the afternoon so
that pictures can be taken of the fight.
They feel sanguine that the fight would
attract 20,000 people to this city and have
assurances from the railroad that special
excursion trains will be run. ,
In the event that a match cannot be
arranged between Jeffries ..and Fltzsim
mo-ns Jack Moffat and Jack Root of Chi
cago will be matched to battle for the
middleweight championship of 'the world,
and Charles Thurston and Rube Ferns
will be signed to box 'a preliminary bout
of twenty rounds.
Greggains has received assurances from
the Police Committee that they will grant
him a permit for July, so that it is a fore
gone conclusion that a big contest will be
brought off .in this city on the national
holiday. ..-'./

IT seemed pld fashion-like' and quite
apropos that the Baldwin stable
should pop one of its bonbons re
opening day at Oakland, for some
thing deliciously invigorating and de
lightful is always looked for from that
direction. The'booking fraternity laid 50
to 1 against Rio de Altar in the betting
on the fourth event over six furlongs, and
all the colt.did was beat Articulate, the
best mud horse on the coast. Charley
Thorpe, who rode Rio de Altar on his pre
vious two starts at Tanforan, is not here
now. He has gone back to his old Ne
braska home. Chances are he will yet
become a good and prosperous farmer.
Rain- had left the Oakland course in a
muddy condition, and little wonder is
there that Articulate was plunged on at
1 to 2 and 3 to 5. "Badshot" Conley re
posed in the saddle and was unable to
outfoot Basslngrer on Frank Bell to the
stretch. Each rider swung wide in mak
ing the turn for home and Alexander,
astride Rio de Altar, hugging the rail in
where the footing was sloppy and less
holding, stole a march. While Frank Bell
and the first choice were bumping to
gether the Baldwin entry won by two
open lengths in 1:17%. The winner car
ried a few strolling bets.
Under the existing circumstances favor
ites managed to hold their own, taking
three of the six events run off. Although
the weather remained threatening, a fair
sized crowd was in attendance: '
The "bush" horse I Don't Know, ridden
by Marty Bergen, and 10 to 1 in the bet
ting, won the first sprint. Irate, the 8 to 5
I favorite, with Ransch up, was heralded
I as the good thing, but under, excellent
! handling the outsider got home first by a
! length. Triple Cross, a grandson of Mo
rello, finished third.
Glendenning, owned by Atkin & Lot
tridge, galloped for the half mile two
year-old dash. Dr. Scharff, the favorite,
put in a very tame bid, and Glendenning,
with J. Martin up, won pulling up from
Estado, a 30 to 1 shot.. The first choice
did not run a quarter before he was short
of ready cash, getting in a-fair third.
Jockey E. Matthews rode Horton in the
seven furlong affair, for which Eonic was
a heavily played favorite at short odds.
Never during his racing career has the
little red horse been beaten when as close
to the leaders at the head of the stretch
as he " was yesterday. Matthews did
everything but stand on his head in the
saddle, and Eonic dropped in first by four
lengths. Andrattus, which made the run
ning, finished in the show.
Several moons have gone by since Malay
has been furnished with his number of
mud. Although the brown gelding's pre
vious race would not look well, framed,
he won the mile and a sixteenth selling
number like a stake horse. Dr. Rowell's
entry -was backed down to 2 to 1 favorit
ism, winning by four lengths from Gaunt
let. Wyoming ran fourth, behind Cas
take.
Mamie Hildreth, another recalcitrant
actress from Tanforan, scored a hit In the
closing scene. Enos must be pounds bet
ter than Bassinger in the saddle, for
Mamie came home on the bit at odds of
4% to 1. La Calma dispossessed Cerro
Santa of the place.

HARRY CORBETT. the well
known sporting man and brother
of the ex-champion heavyweight
boxer, was yesterday ch03en to
referee the McGovern-Gardner
fight, which is to take place in Mechanics'
Pavilion to-night. < The selection was en
tirely unlooked for by Corbett himself and
he was loth to accept the honor, until as
sured that no other man was so agree
able to both boxers. . . '
It was feared that the referee question
would cause some ill-feeling between the
fighters and their managers, but It was
amicably settled and in very short order.
Charley .White, the famous New , York
referee, was open for the engagement,
but as soon as he learned that It was de
sired that some local man referee the
bout he retired gracefully from the field.
Through some misunderstanding the
principals and their representatives did
not come together until an hour after the
time v fixed for the selection of the referee.
At 2 o'clock Gardner, accompanied by his
trainer, met Sam, Harris, manager for
McGovern, and Jim Kennedy, manager of
the Twentieth . Century Club, in a back
room of Corbetfs saloon. The meeting
was short and decisive. Harris said he
knew but a few Californians. Gardner
said any fair man was agreeable to him
and Kennedy informed both that he had
seen a j number of bouts in this city and
said the referees had shown a knowledge

The statement issued by the division in
conclusion says, "It therefore appears
that -instead of there being a loss in the
export trade of Cuba to the United States
the trade is not only being maintained,
but is increasing."
. WASHINGTON, " April 29.â In a recent
statement given to the press by the divi
sion of insular affairs of the War Depart
ment a " considerable loss was indicated
in the trade of Cuba with' the United
States for the first eight months of 1900,
as compared ; with, the same period of
1899. It Is now explained by the division
of insular affairs that in that statement
the value of gold and silver coin and bul
lion was included in the total value of
commerce between Cuba and the United
States. Eliminating the coin shipments,
it is ascertained that instead of there be
ing a decrease in the value of imports
into Cuba from the United States there
is an increase of $1,220,205 for the*, first
eight months of 1900 over the same period
of 1899. It is stated that .while there may
have been an impulse of sentiment at the
close of the war on the part of 'the pres
ent Cuban importers to, buy from the
country that had just secured to' them
their liberty there is no' evidence of .it
to; be found in.' the subsequent .statistics.
There .are isolated cases of Cuban- mer
chants who tried to substitute American
products for Spanish . on sentimental
grounds, but that their efforts proved
very successful cannot : be shown. One
extensive dealer in footwear tried to in
troduce American shoes, but his custom
ers;, preferred the- Spanish last even
though it was coupled with inferior leath
er and poorer workmanship. During the
last six months of 1900 Spain furnished
$620,096 worth of shoes and the United
States $169, 76S worth. Unless the form of
the American shoes can be made to suit
the Cuban taste arid Cuban custom the
American shoe manufacturer, it is stated,
cannot expect to dominate the Cuban
shoe trade. ,The same is true of cotton
goods. Cubans, like the Mexicans, have
come to prefer the goods of European
make and fhe European manufacturers,
through long Â¦ application, have come to
know what these people prefer and make
goods, expressly for that market.

An Epidemic of Highway Bobbery

of highway Â¦ robbery, which the - police

factors appears Imperative. During the

night O. W. Cribb. proprietor of a saloon,
was held up by two masked men and re
lieved of h email sum. lÂ£arly this morn

was robbed at the point of a revolver in
the very heart of town.
Two men giving the names of Mike Mc-
Shane and Frank Williams have. been ar
rested on suspicion of committing these
crimes. A young rough named "Â¦ Downey
and an unknown man set upon a stranger
from Great Kails this afternoon and took
what cash he possessed after beating the
man Into Insensibility. Downey was sur
prised and captured by the police after a
rough and tumble tight in which' several
persons were painfully injured. A Chi
nese was brutally beaten and robbed yes
terday and there is no clew to his assail
ants.
Burglars blew open the" safe of S. A.
Binder & Co., a local butcher firm, at an
early hour this morning and used so great
a quantity of explosives that : a large
building was wrecked.
There Is no clew to tho burglars, who
fled without securing any booty.
At a late hour this evening another Chi
nese was beaten so badly that he had to
be Bent to the hospital. His assailants
were angry because tiiey found no money
on him. The town Is overrun with tramps,
who are exceedingly bold because the

WASHINGTON,- April 29.-The Chinese
Minister to-day stated that all the infor

This. applies not only to tho province of
Pechill, but also to Manchuria and to tho
Yangtze region, as according to a recent
report an uprising: of Boxers is being

similar thanks which Minister Wu has
expressed to Secretary Hay, the Chinese
authorities having taken occasion several
times of late to make, known their appre
ciation of the American efforts to keep
the total of indemnity down to a sum
which China could reasonably meet.
In connection with an organized effort
In New York to continue funds for the
famine sufferars in China. Minister Wu
Is receiving inquiries from persons out
side of New York as to where subscrip
tions can be sent. He is ready to accept
any such donation and will give proper
receipts for the same. His belief is that
much of the suffering exists in tho inte

on the subject, and wh!!e no definite un
derstanding has probably been reached at
tho present time, it may be stated that the
Wabasli will not reach Pittsburg as an ag-
Kres^ivelj' competitive element.
The Pennsylvania was prepared to take
Â¦ LIN lil'illH measures and Gould was quick
to lealize the harm that might be done
his Western roads by the Pennsylvania
opposition. The Gould line will get Into
Pittsburg over the Baltimore and Ohio,
now eontrolled by the Pennsylvania, or
perhaps from Steubenville, when a new
bridge, now planned. Is completed, over
i he Panhandle line.
Th*> details are yet to be worked out, but

PITTSBURG, April 29.â Fire at the cor
ner cf Carson and Seventeenth streets,
South Side, resulted in the loss of one
life, a property loss estimated at $225,000,
consumed over a. dozen buildings and ren
dered a score of families homeless. The
flames were discovered in the basement of
the four-story department store of George
E. Lorsch & Bro. ajid in a very short time
the entire building was burning furiously.
It was In ruins within thirty minutes. A
panic ensued among the customers and
employe's and a report was circulated that
eigrht persons had perished. This was
found to be untrue after the fire was un
der control, the only fatality being the
burning to death of Mrs. Kate Donley's
thrte-year-old child. When the tire
broke out Mrs. Donley and child were on
the fourth floor of the I^orsch building, fin
her haste to escape the mother fell on
the stairway and was rendered uncon
scious. In the excitement the child was
either forgotten or burned before aid
could reach it. A show, r of the burning
timbers was thrown from the" ixirsch
building, carrying destruction in all di
rections. Several ndjoinlng stores and a
number of dwellings were swept by tho
flames. . The losses are pretty well covered
by Insurance. . - '

Mr. Frederic McGreer Is the namo of the
scenic artist at t ho Grand Opera-house, I
believe, and his work in ."Mr. Barnes of
New York," produced last night, was so
eminently tha best thing of the': evening
that I must givÂ« It this place of honor In
my first paragraph; Mr. McGrcer is the
StanrleUi cf the Pacific Coast (It he is an
Englishman, he will, know that this is in
tended, for a genuine qompliment); his Bay
of Ajacclo (act J) and his Gardens of the
Casino, Monte Carlo (act II), are lovely
pictures end vÂ»'o:th a visit, even if the play
were woithlcss.
But the plav is not altogether worthless ;
the second act contains some capital
comedy, verging on the farcical, to be
gure, but never, boisterous and never vul
gar, while tlvV cIohIhq; H'.tuatlon of the

Prosperity of the Inhabitants.
Among the earliest acts of the British
Governor established at Port Louis was
the abolition of slavery In 1813 and the
appointment of an officer for the protec
tion of slaves. In 1832 a scheme of eman
cipation was drawn up by the colorjsts,
*hich In the main was accepted by the
British < Government. In 1835 nil Blaves
wore declared free, tho only restrictions
boliiR the 1 articles . of â¢ apprenticeship.
These were removed In 1839 and the plant
ers received the sum of Â£2,000,000 by way
of compensation. , â¢ â¢ , Â¦
With tho abolition of slavery there
arose, however. -a labor question. . The
Malagasy and African hI.ivi'm had almost
died out, while of those that remained
considerable, numbers j returned to their
native countries. Consequently In 1839
ooollo laborers from India were procured.
Emigration offices being 1 opened in Cal
cutta and Madras, these Immigrants were
placed under tho protection of a. member
of the Mauritius Government specially
appointed. Â¦ They were engaged to sorvo
a llve-jioar Indenture. At the end of that
period they were to bÂ« free. to hire them
selves to tholr former masters or to sock
others.; They might also, if; they wished,
bo gentlemen at large, or return to their
natlvo. country. From tho announcement
quite three-fourths have renewed their
sorvlcfl contracts at llxed rates of pay.
and by degrees they 1 have become landed
proprietors. Very happily for the peace-
HblenoBH and well-bqlng of. the colony the
majority of employers of labor have been
men' of good feeling, who have treated
their .servants with consideration. As .a
consequence'. the relations between mas
ter and man are friendly and mutually
helpful.
Slave Labor and Coolie Labor.
a base for privateering expeditions which
Inflicted very serious losses upon British
commerce. In conseduenco of those dis
asters a British fleet was sent from India
by L.onl Minto, the Governor General. In
lfclO, which, after some heavy lighting,
took possession of Port Louie. -The sub
mission of the whole of the inhabitants
quickly followed, the conciliatory manifes
to of the British admiral aiding greatly In
the pacification process. By the peace of
Paris in 1814 L'Islo de France, with its
dependencies in the Indian Ocean, wa3 as
signed to Great Britain, the Dutch name
of Mauritius belnir restored.
Upon the face of it that is a fair statement. CerÂ«
Iblrily it iÂ» hardly fair to atk the President of a re*
piblic to ignore the dedfions of the Supreme Court
of the country- It happens, however, that in this in
cUnce the Supreme Court is hardly anything more
liian the creature of the President. Castro 'is said to
be supreme in Venezuela and as firmly established as
a ruler ever gets to bs,in South America. The na
tions, arc therefore justified in holding him responsible
for everything. It is- not easy to see, however, what
they can do about it. Uncle Sam will not let any
I.urcpcan power attack the bad man, nor will he act
as a collector of their claims. Castro of Venezuela,
in fact, appears to be ::hout as safe as the Sultan^. â¢
By way of defending himself Castro recently
granted an interview to a representative of the Cin
cinnati Enquirer in which he said: "Present to the
people of the United States my hearty respects and
assure them of the friendship of myself and the Gov
ernment of Venezuela, We promise to guarantee pro
lection to American <Â»nd all foreign capital whenever
invested- in accordan-c; with the laws of the country,
Republic! naturally have interest! in common, and
Matt-merits of unfrienHv isentim&nti Bgainit foreigners
are f?hr Â»nd entirely disproved by leniency toward
MinJftcr Loomii Â»n<i om attitude toward other for*
fign r<r> r c*entativeÂ§, We have no proof that MJn
i&ter Loomli accepted fsvem from the Bermu<k3
Company, but hi* actiftni lead us to to believe, We
!>.."Â¦ proofs that he Jnfhuneed to the pregi.
The DcrmudcJ! Company yesterday formally denied
thfl jurisdiction of the Venezuelan ceurti, I, as Presl.
dent, can recognize ne o'licr authority In the matter."
The powers are r.ot acting in concert. \Each
is supporting a cl.airn of certain of its . citi
zens against the Venezuelan Government some
what similar to the claims made by Amer
icans under the asphalt concession, but each
distinct in itself. It appears that for the pur
pose of settling these claims President Castro some
time ago issued three decrees. The first provided for
th? creation of a commission to pass upon claims, the
liral decision of which will rest with the Supreme
Court of Venezuela; . the second limited the time
ttiihin which claims may be brought to ninety days,
tr.d the third provided for the payment of claims from
a fund to be known as a revolutionary fund.
* The powers are not satisfied with any one of the
rrrangements. They object to the Venezuelan Su
preme Court, to the nintty-day clause and to the fund
cut of which the claims are to be paid. The United
Slntes, Spain and Germany have already served no
tice, on Castro that his decrees are of no effect, and
that they will not consider the decisions of the Su
preme Court as binding upon their citizens. Great
Britain and Holland arc expected to serve a similar
rbticc in a short, time.
We learn by dispatches from Washington that in
formation has been received at the State Department
that in addition to the United States four other pow
ers are making trouble for Castro and are making it
in a very vexatious w?y. These powers are Great
Britain, Germany, Spain and Holland. The four
constitute a formidable combination in themselves,
and when to them is added the United States the ag
gregation becomes irresistible. The only way for Cas
tro to hold his own is to adopt the tactics of the
Sultan and "spar for time."
PRESIDENT CASTRO of Venezuela has acted
so badly toward our Government that.it has
been found advisable to recall the American
Minister, Mr. Loomis, from the country. Conse
quently it may be assumed that Castro is a bold, bad
man from Bitter Creelc, and that future negotiations
with him should be carried on through the medium
cf firearms. When all that has been conceded there
remains enough of other troubles upon the bad man
to entitle him to something of the sympathy that goes
out .to the man who fights against heavy odds.

M., Vallejo. and A. C, City. The so-called
language of postage stamps is an agree
ment that any number of correspondents
m,av enter into as to the meaning of
stamps placed in certain positions on en
velopes. It cannot be said that the plac
ing of stamps in a peculiar position
means what some one has seen flt to call
"the stamp language." For instance. In
that language the stamp at right angles
on the right-hand corner asks the ques
tion, "Does the receiver love the sender?"
Now, a young man may receive an en
velope with the superscription in a femin
ine- nand having a stamp at right angl*
on the upper right-hand corner, and when
he opens the envelope he would think
that there was considerable difference
between the question implied by tho
stamp and the contents of the letter,
which might be a notice from a tailor
notifying him that if the last suit was
not paid for and action would be com
menced to recover amount of balance
due. Tho language as given is:

Here, then, are instruments that promise to open to
the deaf all the wonderful world of sound. Such
things are, genuine blessings. There arc great pos
sibilities in the other exhibits, and their usefulness will
be large, but nothing that can be done for those who
have the full possession of all the' physical; senses
will be so truly marvelous as those whlch> are going
to help, the unfortunate and reveal to them the things
that have been hidden from them,
In the tests made during the evening of the exhibit
it is said the fac-simile telegraph instrument did not
v/ork well in an attempt to reproduce in New York
a picture made in Chicago, but it was explained the
failure was due to the fact that "the wires had been
rendered useless by too much induction", at the New
York .end. Tests made with other, inventions were
more successful. Some deaf mutes- were brought
from an asylum for th-. purpose of showing the efli-
cacy of the -akouphone, and the reports of the occa
sion say: "One of them, Oris. Benson, was both deaf
and blind. He cannot hear a gun shot off within a
yard of his head, only perceiving the vibration of air
caused thereby. It was his performance w;th the help
of the akouphone that interested the spectators. Alto- â¢
gclh'er * He has had but five hours of instruction
in talking. His vocabulary is limited to little more
than.'a dozen words. When Mr. Van Tasscll spoke to
him ! over the instrument it was wonderful to sec the;
expression of delight that spread over his previously ;
sad fa'qe, the smile that came seeming/almost to reach
lo the very qdges of. his flightless, dull eyes. In a
hollow, mechanical voice he repeated the things. .he
heard in the receiver of the akouphone. He said "bal
boy," "papa," and several short words. Then 'a,
gramophone was attached to the instrument and he
listened' to a gay march, smiling and beating, time
on the' table with his fingers." r 1 "'./-.
Other notable things exhibited were a fac-simtlc
telegraph instrument invented by H. R- Palmer for
transmitting, pictures and handwriting, a "telephcragc
carrier" for transporting freight in small bulk, va
rious appliances for improving the telephone, and a
new system for accomplishing long distance ocean
telephony. Two inventions of use in the education
of the deaf and blind were also notable. These were
the akouphone and akoulalion; invented lately by;M;
R. Hutchison. .They ire microtelephonic instruments,
so constructed as to reproduce and intensify sounds
and still preserve their quality. The akouphone is
portable, looks something like a pair of opera-glasses
with a telephone receiver attached, and may be taken
to the theater or other public place by a deaf person.'
The akoulalion, itsed-for similar purpose.?, is not. por- ;
table, but is used in the classroom for the teaching of
the deaf to talk. . Â¦
The invention which attracted most attention is said
to have been a high. power electric light, invented
by PetÂ£r Cooper Hewitt! In the production of tho
lighta gas is used as the illuminating medium instead
of a film, as in the ordinary incandescent light. Mr.*
Hewitt's gas is mercury vapor.' .The lights, are long
and cylindrical in shape. At the bottom of each is
some mercury, from which/when the current of elec
tricity has been run through it, there issues the vapor
referred to. The. current; is transmitted to the , mer-'
cury,. direct, and not by means of the usual coil, for
which reason less power needed to produce the
same amount of light than is required in the old incan
descents. A most peculiar colored light is emitted
from the tubes. It is half purple, half green. This,
according to the explanation of the.' exhibitor, is a
disadvantage, but it 'can be obviated by the use of
counteracting colored shades. . â¢ .
AT a recent meeting of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers. at New York there was
given an exhibition of. various electrical ap
pliances recently invented or improved. It was in no
respect a general exhibit of electrical, work, but only
of such new things as interested' the engineers. -The
total number of exhibits was but thirty-two, and yet
the result of the exhibition as" a whole is reported to
have been marvelous;
ELECTRICAL INVENTIONS.
_Jn^l690 and 1691 French , Huguenot fefu
gces*sent to Bourbon arid Rodrigues found
their way to. Mauritius' arid ' gradually
ousted the Dutch, who abandoned, the isl
and finally, in 1712, ; saying: -"Alas, there
are -too many rats." The French 'took
possession of ''the-islarid In-1715 and again
altered its name to ."L'Isie de France."
The island then flourished exceedingly un
til the outbreak of. the French revolution
in 1789. From that date it enjoyed a
quasi-independence for several years.
However, during the war between Eng
land and Franco the island was used as
French Rule of Mauritius.
In estimating the position which Mauri
tius holds In ' the British ' colonial empire"
we must remember that it. is a heritage
of conquest of great historical , and polit
ical interest. It offers to the student of
biology a remarkable Â¦ proof , of the value
of the intermingling of races. Portu
guese, ', Dutch, Malagasies, Africans,
French, English and Indians have . hero
.combined to produce a vigorous and pros
perous community. The island was dis
covered by the Portuguese . in 1505. They
gave it the' . name'; of "'.'Cerrie," but they
did not form ..any- permanent- settlement.
The Dutch visited the Island in 1598, -when
the admiral renamed It Mauritius,' after
his flagship: The first Dutch settlers were,
persons 'of doubtful ; "character^-convicta
from Batavia,; pirates i and 'buccaneers :qf
the Indian 'Â¦main; ' The : :latter.were-the
real founders 'of much /of 'the wealth of
the .inhabitants. By ; them; slaves were
Introduced ..from 'Madagascar. : Â¦ â¢-
The government of the colony durlngthe
earlier period of British possession was
vested in the Governor. The French Coun
cil of leading colonists was suppressed and
for some .years the inhabitants had no
voico whatever in the administration.
This system was gradually relaxed. The
elective principle In the Legislative Coun
cil was introduced in 1884 by the promulga
tion of a new constitution, which, while
leaving the colony strictly a crown col
onyâthat- is to -say. under the superior
control of the Secretary of State for the
Colonies-gave. the island and its depend
encies a much more representative form
of government than that ordinarily en
joyed by crown colonies. The Legislative
Council was enlarged to twenty-seven
members, of whom eight were ex-offlcio,
nine nominated by the Governor and ten
.elected by the \ votes of those colonists
who were 'duly qualified. Two members
Â¦were assigned to Port Louis and one each
to the eight country districts, Art Execu
tlve Council of five members was also ap
pointed. The members of the Legislative
Council were all unpaid. This is the
present government of Mauritius and Its
de The d rtSmber of voters In 1898 was 6074.
Â¦This franchise Is' enjoyed by every -male
who has attained the age of 21 .on the fol
lowing conditions: First, that he is in full
possession of his civil rights and is not
subject to any legal penalty; second, that
he ia a British subject by birth or by
naturalization; third, that he has resided
at least for the last three years continu

PAPERS 0N CURRENT TOPICS.
Two years ago two German missionaries were
killed by a mob, and for this Germany seized Kiao
chau.and the whole province of Shantung. Shortly
after, this outrage two Germans traveling 1 in the in
terior were driven back to the coast; for this the
German troops burned several villages and slaught
ered hundreds of men, women, and children.; Mr.
Smyth says truly that for the last few years 'China
has been subjected to insults and outrages that would
have driven any Western nation to war, Concluding,
he advises that "rlghteoufme&s and consideration. will
do more to secure our safety in; the future than heavy
indemnities the razjng of forts, prohibition of the im
port of Rrmp, or any ether meaiures that would re^
mind the Ghlneie people perpetually of the injustice
of foreigners and their own intolerable humlllfttton,"
That missionary talki like a Christian, There ihould
be more like him.
The next infamy by France in China, he says,
occurred at Shanghai ir. 1898. Just outside the French
settlement was a house of rest, what we would call
a receiving vault, belonging tcf the people of Ningpo,
where their dead rested until they could be sent back
for'burial with their fathers in their native city. The
building was held as sacred by the Chinese as we hold
cur God's acre. The French Consul wanted to buy
it to enlarge the grounds of U16 consulate, but the
trustees of the property did not wish to sell it.
Thereupon the .Consul proceeded to. tear down the
wall. The owners defended it and drove his work
men away. Whereupon he- landed a ; force from a
French man-of-war and shot dead twenty people in
the street who. were defending the property, tore it
down and took forcible possession and retains it to
this day. A more flagrant murder and robbery was
never committed by the Boxers. But it was not the
work of a-mob. It was done by an official represen
tative of France, and no reparation or apology has
ever been made to China or the owners of the prop
erty! '*''- : :. Â¦ . .
Then France sent a fleet up the river Min and with
out notice, in a condition of profound peace between
her and China, proceeded to massacre three thousand
Chinese. For days the bodies of the dead floated
down the river. For this murder France never made
reparation or apology. Mr. Smyth says all foreign
ers in Foochow, except the French, â¢ openly de
nounced this bloody infamy and posted notices on
their gates that they were not French.
Because some Chinese soldiers had gone over and
fought with the Tonquinese France demanded $16,
000,000 indemnity from China. When it is known
that subjects of France fought in the Confederate
army, and that American citizens are now fighting,
as soldiers' of fortune, in the forces of Dcwet against
Great Britain, and that the laws of war and of na
tions recognize no national responsibility in such
cases, the robber demand of France may be seen in its
true light. Of course China declined to pay, as the
United States would if England should make such a
demand of us. ., â¢
This murdering expedition was let loose by France
and Germany, of all nations! We have heretofore
gladly welcomed every one of the few Christian ex
prcssions of Christian ministers on the subject of the
treatment of China. This French and German butch
ery is illuminated by the statements of Rev. George
B. Smyth of the Methodist church, a native of Ire
land, reared in New York, a graduate of Yale and
president of the Anglo-Chinese College at Foochow,
himself a missionary. He says that sixteen years ago
there was perpetrated by France ten miles of
Foochow one of the crimes of the century.
Immediately, following this ascription to. the Chi
nese character " conies the news of shameful forays
jmong those people by the troops of Germany and
France. There is absolutely no evidence : that the
carnage at the Great Wall in, Kuolu. province last
week had any excuse .whatever.' -In a spirit of boast
ing and vainglory the commanders of France and
Germany report stubborn resistance and an engage
ment lasting eleven hours, in which they lost two men
killed, two slightly wounded and sixteen others in
jured! Now who believes that there was stubborn
resistance and eleven hours' fighting with such mea
ger results in the ranks of the invading force?. No
doubt there was an inhuman massacre of Chinese,
eleven hours of slaughter, that ceased only when the
butchers grew weary in the shambles.
AN -examination of the statement' of Minister
Conger discloses the highest tribute to the
Chinese, that it is possible to render to the
character of any people, present or past. He says
that the unknown and unaccounted for sums paid by
the towns and villages as indemnity to missionaries
for loss of life and destruction of property were paid
voluntarily. That implies a condition of. the public
conscience that should be the envy of the Western
nations. It means an admission of responsibility and
a desire to repair wrongs which, if generally copied,
would introduce the millennium. :, .,'
If a Chinese agent had gone about Wyoming ap
pealing to the conscience of the people for voluntary
payment of indemnity for the scores of Chinese
cruelly murdered there by a mob he would have been
sent after the victims in whose behalf he pleaded.
Ifce people of Louisiana would have" jeered in the
faces of any. representatives of Italy who would
havÂ« asked voluntary indemnity for the lives
of Italians taken by mobs in that State. In
no place where Western civilization lias fas
tened itself, and is living, as it believes", un
der the Decalogue and the Golden Rule, has such
an appeal in such a cause ever been' voluntarily
heeded It has been left to the followers of Confucius
to teach" the w,orld a lesson which should startle the
powers into an immediate manifestation of the high
est sense. of justice in dealing with China. We have
it on the unimpeached word of Minister Conger that
there is in China the highest civilization to be found
in. the ..world, if civilization mean, as it should, the
highest sensibility of the conscience of man.

Thomas Conway, a young man, was
convicted of burglary in the second de
gree by a jury in Judge Lawlor's court
yesterday for* breaking into a sun store
at 703 California street, February 5, and
stealing revolvers and guns. "William
Russell, who was charged with the same
offense, pleaded guilty when arraigned
two weeks ago. Both will be sentenced
Saturday.
Convicted^pf Burglary.
Judge Cabaniss promptly dismissed the
jury, after announcing that he considered
the complaint faulty even before the trial
was commenced. As the complaints in
the other cases are similar, Attorney Col
lins intends to-day to move for the dis
missal of the rest of the defendants.
"In explanation of the verdict," he re
marked, "we concluded that the complaint
was faulty and for that reason, we de
cided to acauit the defendanti"
A short time af terward the Jury filed
Into the court room, having agreed on
a verdict. When asked thÂ© usual ques
tion: "Gentlemen, have you agreed on a
verdict?" the foreman, James Wightman,
arose and announced that the Jury found
the defendant "Not . guilty." Â¦
' Judge Cabaniss delivered his charge to
the jury shortly ' after . 4 o'clock. About
an hour later the Jury " returned to the
court room and asked for additional in
structions. Judge Cabaniss had the short
hand reporter re-read - the charge, and
then ordered the Jury locked up. One ot
the Jurors wanted the cburt to read thÂ©
instructions submitted to him by the at
torney for the defense, but his request
was denied.
Attcrney George Collins, who repre
sented the defendant, maintained that no
crime had been committed, as the prose
cution had failed to establish whether or
not Roache had sold a ticket on a race.
Furthermore, he claimed, that the com
plaint .was faulty inasmuch as It did
not state sufficient facts to constitute the
crime. of selling pools outside of tha ln
closure of a race track.
Roache and a number of other men -were
recently arrested by Captain Wittman and
posse and charged with selling pools out
skfl of a race track. ; ." i"
"Not guilty" was the verdict o\f a Jury
in Judge Cafcanlss' court yesterday In tho

ing pools on the races.

Complaint Is Found
Defective.

Beer is not the only beverage sold at
wholesale rates. "Wine that would create
a row at a camp-meeting and whisky, one
drink of which would make a church dea
con go wrong, can be had by the bottle
at a rate which in itself Is enough to prove
its origin. â
These saloon men are acting within the
law and feel perfectly safe in dealing
out the liquids "by the can or bottle."
They thus rid themselves of a noisy
crowd, for the man who purchases takes
his liquid refreshments to. the "gang" and
it is not unusual to see a number of sol
diers stretched out on the grass with an
empty can plainly in view.
The saloons owned by 0. Welnhold and
M. Rehfeld are particular objects of affec
tion to the soldier, who Is compelled to
patronize such places since the closing of
the canteen. The proprietors of. these
places will furnish a can of any dimen
sion, provided the soldier has the price of
its contents. They will also send a small
boy to bring back the "growler."
By means of the "growler" system the
soldier obtain** twice the quantity of beer
his money would purchase over a bar, ob
tains a "jag" in half the time it takes to
get one -in a saloon and affords the public
a chance to view the result of the closing
of the canteen. ' â¢â¢ * o "
Pretty soon you will see a faded cam
paign hat passed around, numerous
hands dive into pockets arid then a soldier
rises, takes the can, enters a corner
saloon, comes back and the same scene
is repeated. â¢ Â¦â¢ ?"Â¦/- ,â¢â¢
All this Is due to the efforts of the
Police Commissioners to close the saloons
near the Presidio. The cans are obtained
in' the saloons closed by order of . the
Commissioners. The proprietors will not
sell you a glass of beer, but they have no
objection to selling you a can of it, which
means that they know the difference be
tween a wholesale and a retail license.
If you have ! not the can - they will fur
nish you with one, and also a glass or two
to take alone with you.
.Watch the bearer of the can closely and
you will see him make a "bee line" for a
knot of soldiers squatted on the hillside.
If you care to see the finish of the can
you will soon see It uplifted by a pair of
brawny arms. If you are . close enough
you will hear a pair of lips smack and If
you remain long enough you will hear a
dozen pairs smacked. /; ,v.
The Combination of a soldier's thirst and
the natural desire of '.a saloon-keeper to
cater to that thirst has resulted in a
queer state of affairs at the Presidio. The
first thing that meets the eye at the en
trance to the reservation is a long line of
blue-clad forms emerging from numerous
doorways and armed with tin receptacles.
The leasf stumble or misstep. on the part
of the blue-clad ones shows that the "can"
contains the beverage dear to the soldier's
heartâ foaming steam. .

â¢ The copious raind'of the last forty-eight
hours have extended over a wide area of
California. The abundant showers mols-:
tened the regions which sto^d in greatest
need of" rain. '
A well-known farmer from Salinas de
clared yesterday that the rain wpuld add
a million bags of wheat and barley to tha
crops of the Salinas Valley.
Senator "William M. Cutter, who. ar
rived from the upper Sacramento River
region last night, said the ample rain was
greatly needed and would benefit beyond
calculation that section of California.
The showers In the San Joaquin Valley
were not as freauent or as, copious as
those which saturated the fields of North
ern California, but the rain which dm
fall was a blessing, and it came when it
was greatly needed.
The Napa. Sonoma and Santa Clara val
leys were moistened amply. The hay and
grain 'will be greatly benefited.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
vessel repaired, after which sne loaded a
general cargo for Australia.
The Pacific Mail Company's San Juan
sailed for Cential American ports yester
day. She took away a large cargo, but
few passengers.
The Kosmos liner Tanis will sail to-mor
row for Hamburg via Central and South
American ports. She will take away a
very large cargo, principally flour, wine
and canned goods.
The schooner Wing and Wing of the
overdue fleet has arrived at Siuslaw.
Sunday's storm did some damage to the
cofferdam at the new Hunters Point dry
dock. It was nothing serious, however.
The new engine-house is nearly completed
and the tunnel connecting the old dock
with the new pumping plant will be ready
for use in a few days.
Captain George F. Bills, representing 1
a San Francisco syndicate, purchased the
dismasted German ship Otto GildemeisLer
yesterday for $26,100. It is the intention
of the syndicate to go regularly into the
shipping business and the GiJdemeister
will form the nucleus of its fleet. Cap
tain Ellis was formerly in the sealing
LuFiness. but gave up seal hunting to hunt
for eold in the Klondike. He was won
cerfully successful and later sold out all
his interests for a considerable sum. The
Gildemeister will probably be rerigged
here and placed under the Chilean flag.
When the dismasted vessel was put up
at auction yesterday Lorentz Foard made
the first offer of 515,000. Captain Ellis
raised the bid $250. and Henry Rosenfeld
went him ?259 better. Messrs. Ellis and
Rosenfeld had it to themselves until 525.000
was reached, when the latter dropped out
and George Hume took up the running.
Mr. Hume quit at 520,000 and Captain Ellis
secured the vessel with another $100 offer.
Tht- " Gildemeister was regularly con
demned as a total constructive loss and
the insurance companies settled on a
SCii.CCO basis as the value of the ship. The
remains of the vessel thus became the
property of the underwriters and \t was
by that body she was sold yesterday. In
the circumstances the reinsurance gam
blers lose their money and all they can
do is to pay up and look pleasant.
Australia Sails at Noon To-Day.
The Oceanic Steamship Company s
Australia will not get away for Tahiti un
til noon to-day. When the vessel came in
from Papeete there was something the
matter with one of the steam pipes. The
carnage was located in such a spot that
only one man at a time could work on the
repairs. This was the cause of the post
ponement of the departure of the mail
boat from day to day. Among those who
will leave on the Australia are G. L. Ken
nedy and wife, F. S. Samuels, wife and
daughter, and J. S. Huichinson, Mrs. Jo
seph Hutchlnson and Miss Kate Hutchin
son. Mr. Kennedy " is a wealthy Tahiti
planter. Mr. Samuels is one of the di
rectors of the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany, and Mr. Hutchinson is president of
the Canadian P.ank of Commerce.
The Australia will take away a large
general cargo, twelve second cabin pas
sengers and forty Chinese in the steerage.
The Brenn and Indrapura.
The French s bark Brenn and British
tramp steamer Indrapura are curiosities
in their way. The wind jammer has a
regular mena&crJe on beard, while the
tramp Is manned by Lascars, Arabs, Ma
lays. Chinese and Japanese. Captain de
Kupper of the Brenn has been gathering
his curios for years, and the after part of
the bark is now crowded with furs,
Â¦words, guns, spears, bows and arrows
and shells, while about the decks walk,
or run emus, wallabys, dogs, cats, a
&*.nraroo, parrots, magpies and a laugh
iSff Jackass. "
Tha Brenn was tied up for six months In
JCpwenstle, Australia, and during that
time the crew taught the animals and
birds some amusing tricks. The vessel
was nearly 100 days getting here owing to
her bottom being very foul, so the men
continued their teaching, and now the
parrots can swear in three languages.
while the emu is the most accomplished
thief unhung.
The Indraqura secured her rnlxed crew
in Calcutta. They will be carefully
guarded while the vessel is in port so
that none of them can escape. The steam
c-r wiis quarantined because for the month
prior to her leaving Calcutta there had
been 'Â£% deaths from bubonic plague. The
vessel, cargo and crew were thoroughly
fumigated at the quarantine station last
Sunday. Â¦

I sought no medical aid until the disease had
taken so strong a bold on my system that the doctor
felt doubtful of a cure. As I found that several of

trouble and had been cured by Warner** Bate

had decided wisely.

Superior Court. Kretschmar is suing the
company for $50,400 for the loss of both
hands, occasioned In July, 1899, by his
catching hold of a live wire while passing
over the mountain near the incline rail
way.
It is alleged that wires of the company,
carrying a heavy charge of electricity,
had been allowed to droop to within four
or five feet of the ground. Kretschmar
and a companion were crossing the divide
and, coming upon this wire, the former
caught hold of it to lift it over his head.
He was frightfully shocked and hfs hands
were so severely burned that they had to
be amputated.
In Its answer the company sayB the
wires were not strung over any public
trail, but were upon its own private
land, upon which people were at all times
warned not to trespass.

Seriously Injured in
FRESNO, April 25.â D. E. Saunders of
San Francisco, district organizer of the
Ancient Order of United Workmen, met
with a serious accident last night at the
Southern Paciflc depot. He had gone to
meet friends on the 11:30 train and walked
out on the track. Dazed by the glare of
the headlight of the incoming engine and
train, he tried to jump aside, but too late.
The pilot of the engine hurled him into
the air fifteen or twenty feet and he sus
tained a compound fracture of the right
leg below the knee, various contusions on
the right hip and knee, fractures of the
floating ribs and, it is feared, brain and
internal injuries.
The injured man was unconscious all
night, regaining his senses for a few min
utes this monung, but relapsed. News of
his precarious condition has been sent on
to the city and friends are expected on the
first train. â¢

In 1893 Mr. Ince went to sea, which
gave him the opportunity of observing
the conditions surrounding f the wage
earners of the Hawaiian Islands, New
Zealand, Australia and the west coast of
South America. He came to Los Angeles
in 1898 and engaged - in his trade
as a cabinet maker. .In the winter of 1900
he made a study of Arizona, 'visiting all
the principal mining camps of the Terri
tory, and he is now laying plans for an
extensive campaign in that section.
John C. Ince was appointed district or
ganizer on October 3 last, his twenty-fifth
birthday, and general organizer on April
18.
Mr. Ince expects to leave Sa-n Fran
cisco on May 28 by steamer and will stop
at Santa Barbara, where a painters', car
penters' and Federated Labor Union are
in process of organization. From there
he will go by steamer to San Diego, where
he expects to do some special work for
the United Brewery Workers of America,
and in all probability he will organize the
hotel and restaurant workers. He will
also organize a Federated Labor Union
there. This is the last point to be made in
his itinerary. ..
Mr. Ince will leave for ' Riverside, Red
lands and neighboring towns on Thurs
day, and he hopes to organize a Federated
Labor Union in each place. He will be at
Randsburg on May 11 and at Bakersfleld

FRESNO. April 29.â The long-awaited
rain came this morning. The precipita
tion was not much more than a "trace,"
as reported by the Weather Bureau, but
every drop was precious. Advices are that
the rain is general through the valley
much heavier than hereâ and that the
forecast is for considerable more. Never
did moisture come at a more opportune
time to save grain crops on sandy soil or
high land not reached by irrigation.
Fresno.
PACIFIC GROVE, April 29.â Rain began
falling here shortly before midnight last
night, continuing through the night and
most of to-day. It came just in time to
save grain and hay from ruin. Other
crops will be greatly benefited.
KINGS CITY, April 29.â After about
twelve hours of high wind from the south
It commenced raining here at midnight.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon the precipita

blowing from the south and Indicates
Monterey.
STOCKTON, April 29.â After a rain
that was general throughout the county,
varying from a half inch about Tracy to
nearly two inches at Lockeford, the sky
cleared to-day. The rainfall here up to 8
o'clock this morning for the storm was
1.13 inches, but a heavy shower fell here
about 10:30. Special telephone messages
state that there was hardly enough rain
on the West Side to do any good. In
other parts of the county, however, the
rain is of Immense benefit to growing
grain, which was sadly in need of moist
ure. A little damage has been done to
hay. Taken altogether there will be
about three-fourths of an average crop of
grain in the county.
San Joaquin.
SACRAMENTO, April 29.â The rainfall
for the twenty-four hours ending " at 5
o'clock this morning was the heaviest in
the month of April since 1896, when 2.18
inches were measured. The fall for the
present storm up to 5 o'clock was 1.75.
Rain came down in showers all day. The
storm has done an immense .amount of
good to hay and grain all over the Sacra
mento Valley. The hot' north winds of
the past two weeks had parched the
earth and withered crops. The effect of
the rainstorm on fruit will be advantage
ous and practically no harm will be done,
as by reason of the demand and good
prices on early cherries this fruit has
been closely picked and very little* if in
deed any appreciable quantities remained
on the trees at the time of the precipi
tation.
Sacramento.
SAN JOSE, April 29.â The heaviest rain
fall this spring was that of last night, the
precipitation to 10 a. m. to-day amount
ed to LSO inches; for the : season 23.48
inches. Reports from different sections
show that the benefits will more than off
set the damages. If no hard winds follow
the rain the hay and ffraln crops will be
materially assisted, as moisture had been
greatly needed. The fruits injured are
cherries and grapes, but it is not believed
that the loss will be serious. The or
chardists generally look upon the rain
with favor, as it will permit plowing and
cultivating and give the soil a much need
ed wetting. The storm is not yet over.
GILROY, April 29.-Rain has been fall
ing steadily since midnight, the precipi
tation in eight hours to-day being 1.37
inches. Indications are for a continued
downpour, which at this time means the
salvation of all crops in this section.
Santa Clara.
The rainstorm that has been deluging
Central and Northern California for the
last two days is gradually working its
way southward- Yesterday coast counties
as far south as Santa Barbara and San
Luis Oblspo were treated to a deluge, and
there was a considerable precipitation at
Fresno. Late last night Los Angeles re
ported a slight drizzle, with threatening
weather that made the prospect bright
for rain before morning. In Monterey
County there was a tremendous downfall,
while at San Luis Oblspo the precipitation
to -6 o'clock last evening- amounted to
about 2 inches. â¢ The forecast official at
San Diego has his rain signals out.
The subjoined special dispatches to The
Call shew the range of the storm:
LOMPOC, April 29.â Rain commenced

The last of the "ripper" series of mur
ders in London was committed about the
f-th of September, 1SS9. but murders ac
companied by similar mutilations were
committed the next few years following
in other places in England, on the Conti
nent and in New York, pointing to the
fact that the London murderer was still
at his horrible work or that some was
imitating him. For many months the
whole police force of London, with those
of other parts of the world aiding as they
could, was on the search for the murder
er. As body after body was found, the
citv went wild and the women of . the
class to which the victims belonged be
came panic stricken and for the most
part fled to the " provinces. A hundred
arrests were made of suspected persons
and a thousand clews followed to a fruit
less end. The murders went into the long
list of unsolved mysteries that form part
of London's records of crime, with but
little hope of ever being cleared up.
The ill-sounding .but very appropriate
sobriquet of "Jack the Ripper" was be
stowed upon the unknown perpetrator of
a. series of eighteen or more revolting
murders in the Whitechapel district of
London during the latter part of the
eighties. His victims were always select
ed from among: the lower class of women
with whom that part of London swarmed.
They were one and aJl mutilated in such
a similar and peculiar manner as to in
dicate that one hand, and that one well
skilled in anatomy, did each piece of the
horrible work.

STOCKTON, April 29.â By a vote of
nearly 23 to 1, Stockton to-day voted $150,
000 bonds with which to build a new
high school building. The question of
bonding the city for this purpose has been
discur.sed for several years and under the
impetus of the general forward move
ment, the friends of the measure have ac
complished their hopes. Seldom has a
bond election called out as large a vote.
Ordinarily little interest is manifested,
but to-day 1509 votes were polled. Only
65 were against the proposition. Many
voters had to come a long distance to the
polling place.
To James A. Barr, the Superintendent
of Schools, much of the credit is due. â¢ It
was largely through his efforts that tho
Chamber of Commerce, the High School
Alumni and other bodies were aroused to
an active espousal of tho cause. The
members of the High School and Alumni
hired carriages and put in a day's hard
campaigning.
The plans contemplate a twenty-room,
modern stone structure, situated on a
larKd block of land, this to bo laid out as
n park. Five hundred students will bo
accommodated.

the application cf Mrs. Anna Thilo to be
appointed guardian of the estate of C. A.
Thilo, her husband, occupied -the atten
tion of Judge Dougherty's department of
the Superior Court to-day. Thilo is pro
prietor.of the Oberon saloon in San Fran
cisco and was committed to Napa Asylum
several weeks ago. The proceedings were
opposed by Mrs. Ollle Eaton, daughter of
Thilo by a former wife, who claimed that
as her father was a resident of San Fran
cisco the courts of this county had no
jurisdiction.
Judge Dougherty decided otherwise and
appointed Mrs. Thilo and J. C. Kerth
guardians of the estate, under bonds of
$25,000. Kerth !s bookkeeper In the Oberon
Thilo owns considerable property in this
county and spent a large part of his time
on a ranch near Cloverdale. It was owing
to his stranne fictions there that his con
oition wns llrst suspected. Within a few
days, it is said, he dropped $1050 Into a
tslot machine In a Cloverdale resort. His
system was to employ a boy by tho day to
pull the handle while ho poured the money
in.

Supervisor Reed presented a resolution
at the meeting of the board' yesterday
which is intended to determine the rights
of the. board in the matter of raising- the
license on street cars and compelling the
Market-street Railway Company to keep
its roadways paved. The resolution fol
lows: â . ' . Â¦ .. '
Resolved, That the City Attorney Is requested
to give his opinion to the Board of Supervisors
on the following three questions:
Firstâ What is the duty of the Market Street
Railway Company with Â¦ respect to keeping
Market street- paved, and has this board au
thority to compel the said company to repave
the space between its tracks on Market street
in the same manner that the municipality has
paved the remainder of the street?
â¢ Second â Does the fact that some of the fran
chises of the Market Street Railway Company
provide that no higher annual license than $15
a street car may be Imposed have any force
or effect to prevent Boards of Supervisors un
der the charter from making: a different and
higher rate of taxation?
Thirdâ Under subdivision 27 of section 1,
chapter II, article II of the charter, where it
ia proyided that the Board of Supervisors shall
have the power "to fix, establish and reduce
the fares and charges for transporting- pas
aengers and goods" on street railways, has
this Board of Supervisors power to reduce fares
Arbitrarily, or must it first make an investiga
tion into the actual value of the property of
the railway company used in transporting- pas
sengers and ' goods and establish a rate which
shall afford a reasonable return upon such ac
tual value?
Bratmhart Opposes Besolution.
Braunhart, who . "was in an objecting
mood, opposed the .adoption of the reso
lution on the ground that it was abso
lutely impossible to reduce fares without
an investigation. Regarding the duty of
the Market-street Company to keep Its
roadways in repair, Braunhart referred to
its promise to take up abandoned tracks,
which it had not kept. Brandenstein
held that the fares could not be reduced
arbitrarily and the question on that sub
ject was eliminated from the resolution.
Reed explained that Vice President Hol
brook of the Market-street Company had
denied the right of the board to compel it
to pave Its roadway with the same ma
terial as the rest of the street. The reso
lution was then adopted so as to include
questions one and two within its pro
visions. '
â¢Valley Road Gets Franchise.
The ordinance fixing the amounts of the
official bonds of officers and employes of
the Board of Works was passed to print.
The ordinance granting permission to
the San Francisco and San Joaquln Valley
Railway Company to maintain tracks on
Georgia, Fourth and Michigan streets was
passed to print. Reed, who voted in favor
of the ordinance, gave notice of reconsid
eration with the object of Inserting a pro
vision that the company be required to
pave the streets named from curb to curb
in accordance with the charter, and the
ordinance was again passed to print in
that form.
The ordinance providing for the payment
of $2000 to S. H. Kent. O. B. Martin. A. J.
Raisch and H. C. Robinson for services as
members of the Board of Appraisers for
the extension ot the park pandhandle was
passed to print. Hotallng opposed the
ordinance because he held that though the
bonds were declared invalid the apprais
ers might be called upon to perform addi
tional labor in connection with the pro
posed, improvement.

Â¦ Â¦ v " Â¦ ? â .
Supervisor Brunhart vigorously opposed
the adoption of a resolution providing for
the additional expenditure of funds for the
Investigation of public utilities at yester
day's meeting of the board. The resolu
tion directs the City Engineer to make
plans and furnish estimates of the cost
of the ownership and completion by the
city of water works having their sources
of supply from the Stanislaus River or
the Tuolumne River: also to include the
cost of transmitting electric power from
the sources named to tBis city.
The expenses incurred are to be paid out
of the appropriation remaining in the
public utilities fund, which City Engineer
Grunsky has stated will be exhausted at
the end of the fiscal year. Notwithstand
ing Braunhart's opposition the resolution
was adopted. â¢ .
Heights of Buildings.
The ordinance limiting: the heieht of
buildings used for 1 hospital purposes to
four stories and providing that they be
of brick or other fireproof material, was
laid- over for one week.
McCarthy opposed the ordinance limit
ing the height of buildings to be used for
hotel or lodging house purposes to sixty
feet. The ordinance was then passed and
the limitation eliminated but requiring
such buildings to be constructed of fire
proof materials.
The ordinances granting permission to
J. L,. Flood to erect a building 180 feet in
height on Market and Powell streets, and
to C. E. Green and H. T. Scott to erect a
twelve story building on .Geary and
Powell streets were finally passed. Simi
lar permission was granted to' the Mu
tual bank -for. a building- on Market street
near Kearny.
The Board of Health was requested to
direct its chemist to make analyses of the
water of the Spring Valley works four
times each month. " â¢
Regulates Digging Up Streets. Â¦
The ordinance prohibiting the digging
up of any public street without a permit
from the Board of Works was finally
passed.
The ordinance accepting the grant of a
right of way at Bernal station from the
Southern Pacific Company, was .finally
passed.
The tax payers in the -vicinity of Ber
nal Station filed a petition requesting that
the Southern Pacific Company be com
pelled to remove the fence now obstruct
ing St. Mary's avenue so that It mav con
nect with the old San Jose road and Roan

titioned the board on behalf of the whole

NEVER ARISE
No remedy but Paine's celery com-
pound has ever been recommended by
so conspicuously fair-minded a body
of men and women. It occupies a
clear field among men of sound judg-
ment in the cure of diseases arising from
a tired or otherwise impaired nervous
system.
There is no help so sure and so im-
mediate as one gets from the use of
Paine's celery compound. Detailed in-
formation of innumerable cases of rheu-
matism, neuralgia and dyspepsia, com-
pletely cured, has established this srreat
invigorator as the most valuable remedy
those run down in health can make
use of.
Better nutrition for the nerves, an
awakened appetite, purified blood, and
complete assimilation of the food â
these follow the faithful use of Paine's
celery compound as surely as day fol-
lows night.
Paine's celery compound frees the
body of vicious humors that have ac-
cumulated during the winter, and are
the cause of kidney and liver complaints.
Only a great remedy based on a pro-
found knowledge of these diseases
could do the work that Paine's celery
compound is now doing.
Paine's celery compound has ac-
quired its tremendous reputation for
making people well by direct personal
testimony from men and women who
have used it. No testimonial has ever
been piibiished for this great remedy
that could not be easily verified at first
hand by any one at . all interested.
Nothing has ever been claimed for
Paine's celery compound that it has
not accomplished in hundreds of cases.
For the guidance of thoughtful peo-
ple who recognize the need of purify-
ing the blood and regulating the
nerves in the spring, the following
letter to the proprietors of Paine's
celery compound from Secretary of
State Berg of Minneapolis will be of
the utmost value in determining upon
a trustworthy spring remedy:
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 4, 1901.
Dear Sir.3:
One can show no greater faith than
by taking a remedy for one's health.
No better testimonial of excellence
can be offered than the recommenda-
tion of tl.?.t remedy to one's friends.. 1
have taken Paine's celery compound
myself, and as a result heartily com-
mend it to others.

CHICAGO, April 29.â While the world's stocka
were bullish wheat traders were more im
pressed by Liverpool's refusal to follow the
aggressive advance here and heavy lines of
long stuff were offered, May at the opening
being quoted %Â®%c to %@'/2C lower at 73?i@
74c. Outside buying oilers cared for the offer
ings early, but the market showed no rallying
power. This .demand soon died out and longs,
discouraged further by the fall of rain In Cal
ifornia and the lack of export inquiry, the
liberality of receipts and the fact that bug
reports failed to show any spread of the pest,
continued to liquidate the remainder of the
session. May was gradually forced off to
72%c and the close was weak, 1%@%C lower
at 72% l Â§72%c There were no important rallies
on the way down.
May Corn was saved the weakness which
affected July by the neglect with which the
great majority of traders treated lt and by
Eupport from Phillips when the market needed
lt. The volume of trade was rather small.
July sold between 45%c and 45Vfcc and closed
?ic down at 45%c. May closed unchanged at
4SÂ®48%C.
Oats were active and despite a moderate re
cession seemed firm at the bottom. . Elevator
people still led the buying, hedging agalnBt
cash Hales, while tha tush inquiry remained In
its previous satisfactory condition. May closed
W<5%c lower . at 26^c, but closed Vic down
at 2Uc. , . . â¢ ' .'
The provision market wan dull and the tone
eonlcr because of heavy hog receipts and a
slump in Hog prlcex, hut prices suffered little
after thn opening. July pork closed unchanged
at $14 C7%, July lard 'VMlOo down and July
ribs 2%@5o depressed.

WHEATâ The copious rain ' of Sunday j dis
turbed the market, not only here, but at Chi
cago. That market opened lower owing to the
rain In California, -but unfavorable . reports
from the Southwest tended to check the de
cline. Speculation increased, byt foreign ca
bles were disappointing. There was more talk
about Hessian fiy. Some carried over long
wheat was thrown on the market, but 'was
well taken. As the session advanced many dis
gusted longs became demoralized over the
California rain3 and threw their wheat on the
market and Armour bought 1.200,000 bushels
from them and scattered sellers. Â¦ . â¢

Weather %eport.
Mail advices from New York say: "Trade
continues very quiet in nearly all lines. Raisins
arc selling in a email way at the low prices
brought about by the recent cut on seeded on
the coast. Holders ask 5c for - good quality
2-crown loose muscatels, C^c for 3-crown and
.'to? for 4-crown. Some 3-crown of not par
ticularly desirable quality can be bought at
less, it is understood. Spot stocks of loose
available at the quotations given, however, are
not large, some of the largest holders not
offering goods at all on the present market.
A little business is doing In seeded on the
Fpot. but If there is any buying from the
coast it Is being kept very quiet. Prunes are
selling in a small way on the spot.
"Local supplies of apricots are now closely
controlled, the bulk of the goods being in the
]>cssesFlon of a leading jobbing house. All
cheap lots of good quality have been virtually
taken oft the market. Bids of around 7c are
made for choice Moorparks, but holders are
firm at 8c. There Is some speculative Inquiry
fcr unpeeled peaches in bags at 4g4Hc. Con
sumptive demand for peaches shows some
flight Improvement also. Dates are easier.
Hallowi, it is understood, can be bought as

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
Dealings in Union Pacific convertible bonds
were in enormous volume and the price shot
up 7% points in response to the advance in
the common stock. Dealings otherwise were
large and price changes irregular. Total sales,

per cent on the last call.
sensational. But contemplating these special
price movements and the volume of dealings
In the stocks enumerated, one has compasoed
the salient facts of the extraordinary market
of the day. There was no speclflo news to ac
count for the unprecedented dealings which
Unted the day's record to 2,760,000 shares. Ait
the vital point of tha speculation Is the money
supply, the increase In surplus reserves shown
by Saturday's bank statement was a favora
ble factor. The large gain In cash was noted
with especial satisfaction as reflecting tho
continued inflow of funds to New York. Much
store is placed also In the Government inter
est disbursements to be mado May 1 and
large corporation dividend payments are alao
counted upon for help to the money situation.
The reliance rlaced on these factors was made
evident by the small monetary effect of the
fncagement of fl,760,OO0 in gold for export and
the opinion of exchange experts that probably
I&.000.UOO might go out during the week, There
was *ome uuubt as to the destination ot the
gold, but that It would go to the Continent
and not to London neemed evident, The en*
KHtjriu.ni of 11,000.000 additional for London
van unknown until After the close. The de
cline of the Continental exchangee in London
in vplte of the rather pletherlo condition of
the Continental money nmrHett and. the rela
tive Miming of the Londcin money market I*
beginning to.armnie tunntpe in financial elr*
<-le* whether i>repiÂ«ratlnni are not making by
the rvmtnental Utwernment bank* to provide
tor floating a HuMlan loan in addition to iln>
rrqulrenu'nu Â©f the luitipii loan. The strength
of the uleel Â»loeki was accompanist by rumors
of coming utatements which will shew extra
ordinary- earning* by the United NtaU>t tHeel
Coif oration. The belief, ti widespread In spec
ulative riivtm that extensive readjustment!
in the relation! of' the varloun Granger and
raclflc railroad feyÂ«tetti* are necessitated in
<*onu>en*&tlori for the Hurllntston deal. Thin
belief plves rise to varied rumors, almost all
of which are received with ft certain amount
of credulity. The action of the whole mar
ket ehowe clearly that the demand for stocks
from all elapses of buyers maintains its vo
racious force and needs only the leadership
or an upward movement in price to bring in
buying from all quarters that will eclipse all
previous experience In the hiBtory of specu
lative markets In New York. The flnal vola
tile outburst in -Union Pacific and Northern
Pacific to-day seemed to arouse misgivings
and there was free profit taking all through
the rest of the list. But this Is exactly the
history of last week's similar movement In
Union Pacific, which caused widespread ap
prehension lest the culmination of the boom
had 'arrived and which was nevertheless fol
lowed by a renewal in full force of the spec
ulative advance.

The citizens of Oakland, and particular
ly the parents of the 1100 pupils in the
high i schools, have been called . upon to
make good by personal subscription - the
$10,000 that is required to keep open the
schools during the full term. This was
the action taken to-night at a citizens'
meeting held at the school assembly hall
in Lafayette Park at the call of the
Board of Education to consider the condi
tions which have threatened the closing
of the high schools because the fund for :
payment of teachers', salaxles Is ex
hausted.
After a long preliminary canvass'of the
situation three resolutions were adopted,
one presented by Hugh Craig, covering
the subscription plan, and another by
John P. Irish, naming a committee of
five to devise measures for raising the
money. This committee is composed of
Fred L. Button and Giles H. Gray, rep
resenting the School Board; J. L. Lyon.

ALAMEDA. April 29.â Mrs. I. N. Chap
man will be a member of the new Board
of Library Trustees. President Forderer
of the City Trustees announced the ap
pointments of the board to-night as fol
lows: Mrs. L N. Chapman, P. W. Bar
ton, John Luteen, E. W. Maslin and
George H. Maatick. The personnel of the
board remains as it was appointed two
weeks ago.
To-nigrht's appointments practically set
tle tbe fight for and against Mrs. Chap
man's appointment. Mr. Bowers has ad
vised his colleagues to abide by the de
cision of the president of the City Trus
tees, and. while the new appointees nom
inally have ten days In which to decide
whether to accept or not, they have prac
tically decided to let the matter rest.
Trustee Mastick said to-night that, now
that the matter has gone so far as to give
Mrs. Chapman the legal right to a place
on the Board of Library Trustees, It Is
settled as far is he is concerned.
It was found that the appointment of a
member of the Library Board by each of
the City Trustees did not conform to the
law, which requires the president of the
City Trustees to make the appointments;
hence the action of two weeks ago. when
individual nominations were made by the
trustees, was rescinded at to-night s
meeting to clear the way for the appoint
ments by Iho oresldent. ;\ '
After tho Library Trustees were dis
posed of the board took up the Police De
partment. Trustee Hammond Introduced
a resolution declaring all positions on tho

"The organization of the Central High
School was on the unanimous opinion ot
two Boards of Education, a. wise, Just and
a paying proposition. The former City
Council may have thought It was right,
but the board also believed Its action was
right.
"But it is not right to ask the teacher*
to contribute one-3txth of their year'a
earnings to get the. city out of Its diffi
culty. They are loyal to the schools, and
because of their loyalty they should not
be Imposed upon."
The Board of Education met Informally
after the meeting and directed Superin

ACT IN EXTRAVAGANZA
There were many anxious minds relieved
when the' yachtsmen, bedraggled and
worn, moored the boat -In the estuary and
made their way to their homes this noon.
' Before they got into any kind of shelter
the Venita's parly was- drenched. The
prospect of staying all night without shel
ter was far from inviting, especially as
the yachtsmen had not provisioned their
little craft for so long a stay. For hours
they crouched in the tossing boat, exposed
to the elements, and they gave huge sighs
of relief when at last day dawned and
with it came the abatement of the storm.
The Venita left Oakland yesterday
morning, carrying, besides the skip
per, Captain Austin, J. W. Tay
lor, his son Joseph Taylor, Van
Ness -Taylor, son of Assistant Jailer
George W. Taylor of the County Jail, and
a Mr.^Butler. The party headed for up
the bay and the Venita was well on her
trip when the storm broke that was re
sponsible . for their struggle for hours
against wind, rain and sea. Captain Aus
tin was unwilling to try to beat home
against the strong southeaster. The Ve
nita was handy enough, but he hadn't any
sailors to assist him and finally decided to
run up under the lee of^Sheep Island and
try to nnd anchorage until the storm
should abate.
A yachting party of Oaklanders on the
yawl Venita, Captain Austin, had a peril
ous all-night battle with the storm last
night. Their absence caused their friends
and relatives in this city, considerable
alarm, that was not allayed until noon to
day, when the yachtsmen returned, cold,
wet, tired and half starved after their
trying experience.

Every detail of the charming function

begged off on the' sp'eechmaking proposi

"We could not enjoy our luncheon,"
they cried, "if we had the thought of a

"For many years I was troubled with nervous dys-
iKpalo. Weeks at a timo I have suffered so much that 1
could not retain food at all. These attacks brought on
nervous prostration and I pot no rest day or night. I
tried many physicians nnd advertised remedies, but never
found relief until Dr. Miles' Nervine was recommended. I
- then found I could rest well and retain food and waa soon
restored." Mrs. K. Puekneb, Jeferson, Wla.

WHOLESALE MERCHANT
DIES AT LIVERMORE
Passing of John F. English, Who
Carried on Business Forty Years
in San Francisco.
John F. English, an old- time San Fran
risco merchant, died at Livermore Sun
day evening at the age of 5S years. Forty
Z.<?arE ago he came to California .on a
mailing vessel, serving as foremast hand.
He landed in San Francisco with only a
lew dollars in his pocket, but there was
then need for men of his stirring disposi
tion and it was not long before he began
to lay the foundation for his future pros
perity. First he peddled potatoes and ac
cumulated some money. Then he set up
a store at 305 Davis street. From that
time on he was engaged in business in
iho wholesale section of the city, moving
first to 315 Davis street, and later to
Drumni and Washington and Clay and
Davis. He invested in real estate and
made several turns, which gave him "a
(toe profit. He made so many successful
Â«>als in potatoes that he was known for
?Â«â¢ Tie years as "the potato king "
Mr. English was interested in politic
r>nd was a loyal member of the Repub
lican party for many years. He was fond
->f pood horses and owned several which
he delighted to drive through the park
For pome time he has been ill Upon
Ihe advice of physicians he was taken
to a sanitarium at Livermore some
months ago. Besides a widow, six ihil
cren survive the deceasedâ Dr. C F J
F. Jr.. George E. and Edward F Eng
lish, and two daughters, who are attend
ing school. Mr. English was a Free
Mason, being a member of Mission Lodge'
He was also a charter member of the
San Francisco Produce Exchange. He
was a native of Quincy, 111.
ENGINEER HERLIHY
TELLS HIS STORY
Hearing of His Appeal Is Begun by
the Supervising Inspector,
Â¦ Captain Bermingham.-. ..â¢
The appeal of "P. H. Herlihy from the
judgment of the United States Inspectors
of Local and Foreign Steam Vessels, re
voking his license as chief engineer, was
begun before Supervising Inspector Cap
tain John Bermingham yesterday. Herli
hy's license was revoked on the sround
that he was" not attending to his duties
as chief engineer at the time of the wreck
of the Rio de Janeiro. . ,
Several witnesses, were examined, but
their evidence was merely a repetition of
that given by them on the occasion of the
official investigation of the wreck.
The investigation will be resumed at
10:30 this morning.
LI AH YIN MAKES
VARYING STATEMENTS
Says Her Father Lived m. the East
and Here at the Same
Time.
Samuel M. Shortridge appeared before
Commissioner Heacock yesterday to re-
Enforce Louis P. Boardman in the de
fense of Li Ah Tin, one of the Chinese fe
male slaves captured in a den in Sullivan
alley. - . . . . Â¦
The woman testified that she was born
at 741 Jackson street In this city 23 years
ago. and was taken to China bv her
mother wh'en four years old. She returned
to this citv on the Rio de Janeiro in
March, 1S97, and was landed by Collector
Jackson as a native born American. Her
father met her on the boat and took her
to 741 Jackson street, where she remained
until his death. She afterward became
an inmate of Sullivan alley.
Her father, she said, was in the business
of general merchandise east of the Rock
ies and never had any interest in the
drug business here. In fact he. seldom
came to this city and died in the East.
The record of the Chinese Bureau con
taining the transcript of her statement
to the bureau on the Rio in 1897 was
placed In evidence. It showed that .she
then stated that her father conducted the
drug store at 741 Jackson street. This is a
material discrepancy.

May 10 A the Date Designated
for Taking Hold in
New Field.
John I. Sabin, "who "was recently elected
president of the Chicago Telephone Com
pany, leaves San Francisco next Tues
day to begin active work In his new field
of employment. He takes hold of affairs
in Chicago on May 10. He was asked last
r.ight if he would take from San Fran
cisco skilled assistants to help him carry
out his plans in the East and replied that
It v.as his intention to take five or sis well
known men from this city to Chicago. He
mentioned Chief Engineer A- J. Steiss,
Electrician F. "W. Alston, Auditor John A.
Mallon and Chief of the Canvassers C. E.
Nestor. District Manager Bush of Spo
kar.e has also been invited to join Mr.
Sabin in Chicago.
C E. Nestor's special line Is the intro
duction of telephones to household ser

having been connected with Edison s
laboratory in New York. He came to San
rrar.cisco to introduce the phonograph
and in the course of events accepted a
pj^tco in the telephone company. He is
clapped as a hish-grade man.
Auditor Mallon is also spoken of as a
man of superior attainments in his par
ticular line. He went to Chicago some
time ago and gave the managers there
quite a surprise when he presented his
simple system of transacting business.
A. J. Steiss and F. W. Alston are men
who possess the highest order of ability.
Mr. Sabin apprehends that the places
made vacant by the transfer of these men
to Chicago can be filled by promotions
from the line of trained and expert men
employed by the Pacific States Company.
In his new field cf duty President Sabin
will be called upon to minister to the
"helio" wants of thirteen million people.
The population of the Pacific Coast terri
tory does not exceed three million, hence
there is a big increase to consider.
They "Will Accompany
Him to Chicago to Do
Special "Work.

FIVE EXPERTS
Unrequited love seems to be the only
reason for the suicide of Fred Carl Hath
away, the 16-year-old lad, who ended his
life on , Saturday evening by inhaling
Illuminating gas in a lodging-house at 737
Market street.
The body x>f Hathaway was removed
from the Morgue yesterday and will be
shipped to his parents at Ophir to-day.
Hathaway came to San Francisco from
his home at Ophir. Placer County, one
month ago, and as he was a good pianist,
sought congenial employment in Sher
man, Clay & Co.'s music store.
Investigation yesterday showed that
Hathaway was a steady lad and attended
strictly to business. He lived with his
brother at 937 Post street and spent his
evenings at home. If he had any cause
to worry he kept the fact to himself.
Neither his brother nor the. employes of
the music store where he worked- ever,
heard him make complaint..
The fragments of the torn letters found
in the room where Hathaway committed
suicide furnish the only clew to the motive
for self-destruction. The young man re
ceived a letter on Saturday from New
castle, Placer County, and the torn frag
ments show that it was wi-itten by "Emily
Sirvain." the writer referring many times
to "Jim." and giving her address as "Post
office box C6.".
Hathaway' s brother said yesterday that
he did not know any one by the name of
"Emily Sirvain." but that a family of, that
name "resided at Xewcastle. which is two
miles from Ophir. Placer County, where
Hathaway's mother and his stepfather re
side.
It is thought by the police and the Cor
oner's deputies that young Hathaway had
received a letter informing him that the
writer had transferred her affections to
another and that In a despondent mood he
killed himself. .
Unrequited Love Evi
dently Drove Hath

SERIOUS CHARGE MADE
AGAINST TWO OFFICERS
Chappelle and 'Â¦. Sylvester Accused of
Accepting Money From Fallen
Women.' , ! ;
Angelina M. Abbott, the girl who shot
De Witt Clinton, the. actor, about a. year
ago, appeared in . Judge Cabanlss* court
yesterday oh. charges of vagrancy " and
disturbing the peace. She was arrested
Saturday night by Policemen Chappelle
and Sylvester. The girl was arrested on
April 4 by Chappelle on a charge of
vagrancy and the case was dismissed by
Jurfse Coman. - .
The cases against the girl were con
tinued till to-day and when she left the
courtroom she went to Captain' Seymour
and stated that she was being persecuted
by " the officers because she did not give
them money. She declared that, in the
presence of. the landlord of the hou5e at
27S O'Farrell street, Mike Nolan, a noto
rious character, told her. after her first
arrest, that if she did as his girl, who
lives in the same house. . didâ pay $20 a
month to I the officersâ she would not be
molested. She was instructed by, the cap
tain to subpena the landlord and Nolan
to be in court this morning so that their
statements could be taken under oath.
Both officers indignantly deny the accu
sation and state that the Abbott woman
is constantly on the street and that they
had warned her to keep away. When she
was arrested Saturday night she expec
torated in their faces. Nolan's girl, ac
cording to the records, was arrested twice
in February, but not since.

YOUNG UNIVERSITY SOLDIERS, i WHOSE ' SKILL ' IN CONDUCTING
THE MANEUVERS DURING .THE ANNUAL REVIEW AND INSPEC
TION ON THE BERKELEY CAMPUS WON THEM DISTINCTION. !
THE annual inspection, review and
battle exercises of the cadets of
the University of California, which
have come to be looked upon . as
being among the most picturesque
features of college life, were deprived of
all their attractiveness yesterday by, the
inclement weather. The sham . battle,
which was to have been the event of the
day. had to be omitted entirely, as the ca
dets, dressed in their pa'rade equipments,
did not relish the idea of creeping behind
muddy breastworks, fording miniature
rivers and marching and counter-march
ing through the wet grass. The pro
gramme, which was to have lasted the
day, had to be crowded through in a few
hours during the morning. Owing to. the
haste no spectators were present to wit
n.css the evolutions and give applause to
the winning company.
The inspection, was held- upon the cam
pus. Lieutenant Colonel M. P. Maus, of
the United States army, acted as inspec
tor. The cadets, 600 strong, marched past
the reviewing stand, and made a very
commendable showing. Company E. of
which R, T. Fisher is the captain, wa3
adjudged to have shown the most effic-'
iency in the maneuvers, and.was.accord
ingly awarded the colors. Company B,
cf which W. B. Bakewell ,is captain, se
cured second. honors. The university band
furnished the music for the occasion.
A gold medal was awarded to I. ! B.
Rhodes for having made the highest gen
eral average at target practice during the
year. First Lieutenant ,N. :Vandtrbilt
made the second highest average and' was
presented with a silver medal.' - - ;

DIVOBCT IS GaANTED TO
MRS. ARTHTJB MACONDRAY
All the Proceedings Took Only Twen
ty Minutes Befors Superior
. Judge Cook.
It took twenty minutes in Judge Cook's
court yesterday -afternoon for the- mar
riage ties that bound Mr. and Mrs. Arthur
Macondray to be severed. General W. H.
L. Barnes appeared for the plaintiff, Mrs.
Macondray, and the respondent, who was
not present, was represented by Attorney
E. J. . Pringle.
Mrs. Madeline Macondray testified that
she was married on August 28, last. They
wenf to Manila on their wedding tour and
on arriving there she found that her hus
band had neither - position nor money.
They came home on the transport Han
cock. He used to call her bad names and
would curse and swear at her, she said.
He often came home drunk and abused
her. He would be away*for two or three
days at a time and when he returned
would say that- he had been at the ham
rnam baths. He had failed to support her
since their marriage. - Â¦
Mrs. Ethel Clisby, at whose house the
couple boarded, testified to having heard
Macondray on different occasions call his
wifo vulgar and offensive names and Mrs.
"W. G. . Richardson, Mrs. Macondray's
mother, testified that her daughter had
been forced to take refuge with her be
cause of Macondray's cruel conduct. She
had heard him abusing her daughter and
lie had failed to contribute to her sup
port. ' *
The Judge granted the divorce on the
ground of extreme cruelty.
It begins to look as if one would have
to carry, his lunch basket or go hungry
on Mayday. The man who patronizes *
restaurant, upon whose: menu no union
label is attached wiil not be in it for the
three square meals a day on and after
that date, according to the dictum of the
waiters. Â¦ 'Â¦"Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
The Cooks* and "Walters' Alliance ha3
decided that it will stand by its schedule.
At a meeting held last night at 102 O'Far
rell street fully 1000 men and women were
present and declared themselves in favor
of the schedule heretofore submitted to
the. restaurant proprietors. Now it is up
to the restaurant eater to guess whence
his next - meal may come, no matter
whether or not the price be in his pocket.
The cooks and wallers say they will not
give in. The employers say the same, so
the hungry multitude must bring its lunch
basket along, for no tip, no matter how
large, will change the waiters' or the
cooks', attitude.
- Early on Mayday morning- the. strike
will . go into, effect. Tuxedos, swallow
tails, white neckties and aprons will be
dropped in one fell bunch if the men con
ducting the caravansaries do not concede
the demands of the men and women who
hurl the plates around.
A considerable quantity of eloquenca
was launched into tbe air at the meeting
last night, but one and all seemed de
termined to carry out the objects of the
union. Orators . without number spranjy
forth. The burden of their lay was
"shorter hours and more pay." To ac
complish this end less than thirty-six
hours separate employe and employer. It
looks like a short, sharp fight, with the
hungry man the intermediary.
The following is the schedule that ha3
been adopted by the union and will be de
manded of restaurant proprietors, hoteia
so far being exempt from its provisions:
Steady work, ten hours a day. J3 per week.
â¢ Lunch and dinner in same house, five hours,
$1 25 per day.
Lunch, three hours or less, 75 cents.
Lunch or dinner on Sundays or- holidays,
four hours or less, 75 cents. .-.â¢ :
Extra work, $2 JO per day.
Extra time, 25 cents per hour.
Six days per week -and. ten. hours per day
to be the maximum.
The waitresses will meet at the same
place to-night to perfect their further or
ganization.
Restaurant Keepers' Association.
The Restaurant Keepers' Association
held an enthusiastic meeting last right
at 32 O'Farrell street, and adopted rules
for the government of the association.
After May 1 the initiation fee will be a
per capita tax of 50 cents for each person
employed by the member. A member ex
pelled and applying for reinstatement
must pay a per - capita tax of $5 per
employe before he is again entitled to
membership. In case a member resigns
and later applies for membership he must
pay a. per capita tax of $1 per employe
before he Is -eligible. .
It waÂ» decided by the association to
open a bureau of information with an
employment bureau in connection. Res
taurant and hotel help are to be regis
tered free of charge. The bureau "is to
be located at 127 Mason street.
Walter R.; Dinmore, who resides at the
Palace and whose matrimonial venture
with- Mrs. Cone of Denverâ their estrange
ment and the sudden flight to the East of
the blushing brideâ caused much gossip
recently,. is again before the public.
Yesterday: Dlnmore, or _ at. least his at
torney, ; George D. Collins, on his behalf
filed In the United States District Court
a petition in bankruptcy. The, document
explains that Dinmore is on the wrong
side of the ledger to the amount of $17,
179 94 and that he has nothing upon which
his creditors can levy excepting wearing
apparel valued at 5300. The heaviest
creditors are those who hold bills that
were contracted while â¢ Dinmore was a
member of the firm of the Diamond Soap
Company. "VV. A". Levy of .Petaluma holds
Dlnmore's notes to the amount of $5000,
and Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Bank is down
for $48S1. Jules (iamage. the bad debt col
lector, is also, down on. the list for $746.
Dinmore includes among h!s debts a
number of personal bills, among them be
ing one for $275 from the firm of Bullock
& Jones for clothing and neckwear.
Dinmore has for â¢ some time been con
nected as a salesman: with the firm of
Wetmore ,& Co., wine merchants. He
engaged commodious rooms in the Palace
Hotel and decorating them in a tasty
manner, put a mercantile sign over the
door and awaited wine patrons. He met
with immediate success and large num
bers of the tourists who were staying at
the Palace vftlted his quarters and pur
chased California, wines.
Dinmore says in reference to the bank
ruptcy proceedings that he has acknowl
edged a number of accounts that he had
no business to; that he Is "bothered by
creditors morning, Â¦ noon and night, and
that he is tired of it. He i says -. that
though he has started Insolvency .pro
ceedings that this does not mean he will
not recognize ' all bill's.'
