JAMES CARDINAL, GIBBONS, ARCHBISHOP OF BALTIMORE. WHO IS

'" FAIRS IN TÂ±iE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINES.
ROME, May* 29.-Cardinal Gibbons
has determined to prolong his
stay in Rome, and he will re
main here during the greater
part of June.. The Cardinal says
the appointment of a rector of the
American College here to succeed Mgr.
O'Connell, the Bishop of Portland, Me.,
has not reached a stage where any
statement can be made.
It is understood the Cardinal during
the audience he had with the Pope ex
plained at : length" the views of -, the
Government at Washington regarding
religious niatters in the Philippines. â¢
Cardinal Gibbons is also advising . the
Pcpe to consider the question of a.suc-

Iruaddition 10 this',. it" was realized that
the exporters of- Chinese tea, which pays

which 'ire ' also subjected to ;a high ; tariff,'
would send their goods'; to the -Philippines;
paying -the slight duty]', there'.' exacted,', and
then havej thein forwarded to the United
States.'Tvhere they would be entered witia
iput.additional.'c'ost. " â¢ 1
'.'Japanese' and Oriental/ goods of all dfe-
By Way of Philippines.
" "When It 'was asserted in opposition to
this view that the constitution expressly
prohibits the imposition of export duties
the answer was promptly returned that
under the decision of the Supreme Court
the constitution has not been extended by
Its own .force over the Philippines and
that therefore the prohibition heed not be
taken into consideration.- It. was argued
that the constitution had no force in the
Philippines until it had been extended
there by act of Congress.
This view of the case was generally
concurred in, but the question was deemed
to be too impovtant to be settled at an in
formal . conference, and nothing definite
will be done until the President and the
Cabinet return to Washington, when the
question will bo discussed with Secretaries
Root,, and Gago ] and Attorney ' General
Knox... The probability is, however, that
there will be no extra session . of Con
gress, and that in the Spooner act will be
found ample authority to meet the situa
tion. The President will probably issue an
order applying solely to the Philippines,
imposing upon goods exported from those
islands to the United, States a rate of duty
equal to the tariff imposed by the Dingley
law upon the came 'articles entering the
United States.- This, it. is believed, will
close the door by. a "method certain to be
sustained by the Supreme Court if a test
case" should be brought before "that tri
bunal for decision.-
Some consideration was given to the
question whether ith'e President had the
power under the Spooner act to' impose. a"
duty in this country upon articles import-'
ed from the Philippines.; -The general
opinion was that grave doubt existed as
to .whether he possessed this "power, and
it seemed to be accepted that the export
duty- plan offered the rffost; feasible solu
tion. The" importance' of; speedy action
was emphasized in \ view. of, the fact that
if the matter is left unsettled vuntil Con-*
gress meets next December there willbe
very large importations of hemp, tobacco
and sugar from . the Philippines without
the payment of, duty. :> .
Question of 'Export Duties.
ON THE PRESIDENT'S TRAIN, Ali-
TOONA, Pa., May. 29^â Serious considera
tion" has. been given ;by the President- and
the Cabinet to the decision of the United
States Supreme'Court in the Porto Rican
cases. The full-text of .the opinions was
eagerly read by the President. The extent
of the problem presented by the first de
cision, annulling- the duties collected un
der the Dingley law .< upon Porto Rican
imports, was then for: the first time fully
realized,, the mere skeleton of -the decision
wired from .Washington having, failed to
state fully this phase of the question.
"While it was .appreciated that the ques
tion of the duty on Philippine-importa
tions involved in, the case' of the diamond
rings brought back . from Manila by an
American soldier has not been actually de
cided, it was felt that" the court had prac
tically settled the matter ..by its . Porto
Rican decision, and the doorway from the
Philippines into the United . States was
now very wide open. ; * â¢ :
This being the case,' the idea of an extra
session of Congress to -enact- for. the Phil
ippines a law similar to the Foraker Porto
Rico act was at once suggested and for a
while was seriously entertained.' _
Will Avo ; \ Extra " Session.
The President, however, did '. not hesitate
to express his desire to, avoid an extra
session if some other way. out of the diffi
culty could be discovered and the Cabinet
concurred with him, believing that' only a
most extraordinary, situation would war
rant the convening of (Congress. 'Having
decjded therefore to approach; a. { solution
of. the .problem .; through .other
method than-Congressionicl legislation, the
President and the* Cabinet * proceeded to
consider, other.- prppbsltipns.y.The /result of
the conference, was a belief Â£hat in' the
act for the government of the Philippines,
passed as a rider to the army appropria
tion bill in the closing days of the; last
Congress, known as* the Spooner la/w;
there might be found the requisite relief
from the unexpected situation created by
the decision of the Supreme Court. ; The
Spooner act, it will be remembered, in
vests the President with absolute author
ity to govern the Philippines until Con
gress shall otherwise direct. Under this
law, it is held by the Cabinet, there can
be no doubt of the President's power to
frame and enforce a tariff law for the
islands. The suggestion was also made
that he could go a step farther and im
pose an export duty upon all articles sent
from the Philippines to the United States.

The demand was in the shape of a type

gave it -to a horseman in a certain place
they must take the consequences. . Di
rections were eriven that they were
to start from Madrone. eighteen miles
south of here, drive along the : foot
hill road in the eastern part of the valley,
then continue their journey to East San
Jose and into town. They were to use a
certain wagon, r At a certain point In the
road they would meet a man riding a
white horse and they were to hand over a
bag containing thÂ© money to this horse
man. J
This was to have been done on May 13
and on that date the Deslmones and
Sheriff Langford and posse went over the
route. A bag of iron washers that looked
like money was placed in a wagon driven
by the intended, victims. In accordance
with Instructions a stop of rive minutes
was made at each crossing. Half a mile
behind followed the" Sheriffs posse, who
aimed to keep in sight of the wagon and

failed to show up. â¢ It may be that the
man who wrote the letter saw the party
following the wagon, or that he nevey in
tended to carry out the plot laid.
Since that time a similar letter haa been
received by the Desimones, written In
Spanish, and renewing the demand for
$2000. The Sheriff's office has been un

ecrlptlons could also enter the United
Etates by this roundabout but economical
route. It is certain, therefore, that this
new phase of the Philippine problem will
receive immediate attention 1 as soon as
the President and the Cabinet reach
Washington; and In view of the import
ant questions involved and the necessity
of action, there is very general satisfac
tion that the national capital is beine
Epeedlly reached.
of organizations should have - dominion over
It. The' university should exist for its own
sake to carry out its own purposes and to
bring: out its own results In Its own way.
In this regard the die Is cast, once for all.
The choice of the founders of the university
was deliberate and final. They .chose the' path
of intellectual and religious freedom, in the
very Interest . of religion Itself, Religion la
devotion In action. In its higher reaches it
must- be individual, because It Is a function
of the individual . soul, which must : stand- In
perpetual protest against the religion which
llnrln its end in forms, and ceremonies and or
ganizations. . . t â¢ <. , . :
Religion must form the axis of | personal
character and its prime Importance -the univer
sity cannot Ignore. To the end of its culture
it may use indirect rather than direct means,
the Influence of effort and character rather
than the Imposition of forms. To accept ec
clesiastical help Is to invite ecclesiastical con
trol toward ecclesiastical ends. In the grant
of endowment it was required that the trus
tees should "prohibit sectarian Instruction, but
to have taught in the university the immor
tality of the soul, the existence of an all
wise and benevolent Creator, and that obe
dience to his laws la the highest duty of
man."
This requirement was a simple reflection of
Mr. Stanford's own religious character, as ex
pressed In the words of one very near to him:
"If a firm belief In a benlflcent Creator, a pro
found admiration for Jesus of Nazareth, and
his teachings and a certainty of a personal
life hereafter constitute religion, then Leland
Stanford was a. religious man. The narrow
walls of a creed could not confine him: there
fore he was not a professed member of any
church, for in each confession of faith he'
found something to j which he could not sub
scribe. But for the principles of religion ho
had a profound .veneration; In his heart were
the true sentiments of Christianity,'' and he
often said that In his opinion the golden rule
was the cornerstone of all true religion."
Freedom of Thought.
The founders believed 'truly that freedom
of thought and action would promote morality
and religion, that a. deeper, fuller religious
life would arise from the growth of the in
dividual, that only where "winds of free
dom" blow will spring up the highest type
of religious ' development. For character is
formed from within by the efforts and striv
ings and aspirations of the individual. It can
never be imposed from without. The will is
made strong from choosing the right, not
from having right action enforced upon it.
The life of man Is "made beautiful and sweet
through self-devotion and self-restraint." But
thin must be chosen . voluntarily, else it fails
of Its purpose.
The growth of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity must remain the best evidence of its
founder's wisdom. He had the sagacity to
recognize the value of higher education and
the patriotism to give tho rewards of a suc
cessful life to Its advancement.
He had the rarer wisdom to discriminate be
tween the real and the temporary in univer
sity organization and management, and his
provision Is for the genuine and permanent,
not for that "which speedily' passes away."
Still more rare, he had the forethought to
leave to each succeeding generation the duty
of. adapting Its details of administration and
method to tho needs of the time.
. If the founder we love , and the ' founder
whose memory we revere has said. ' "We will
found a university so strong that it may en
dure for all the centuries and wfcofle organi
zation shall be so freo and flexible that in
each ape It shall reflect the. bet spirit of

Suit Against His Daughter
for Family Heirlooms Is
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 29.â The suit of
Colonel Blanton Duncan against his
daughter, Mrs. Katherine Lewis, to re
cover $5000 worth of jewelry and other ef
fects left by his deceased wife, was con
cluded in the Superiot Court to-day and
Judge Ballard will render his decision to
morrow. Colonel Duncan made a long ar
gument, In which he attempted to con
vince the court that the heirlooms given
to Mrs. Lewis by his late wife belonged
to him and were hers to use. but not to
give away. The defense submitted the
case without argument.
"I am satisfied," said Judge Ballard,
"that most of these articles were given
outright to Mrs. Duncan. Notwithstand
ing the testimony of the plaintiff, I be
lieve It. was his intention to give these
articles to his wife. Giving a wife such
articles as a lace dress, with tb.e reserva
tion that it is to come back to the hus
band. Is at utter variance with the usual
custom between husband and wife. On
the other hand, if the common law pre
vailed in Kentucky at the time of the
gifts, some of the articles In possession of
the wife were also the property of the
husband."
Shouts at Colonel I*ewis.
During the proceedings to-day, when the
outlook appeared to grow more and more
gloomy. Colonel Duncan became much ex
cited. Among the circumstances that con
tributed not a. little to the colonel's dis
comfiture was the presence of Colonel
Tom Lewis, husband of the defendant,
who bothered the old man with his mys
terious actions. While testifying, Colonel
Duncan discovered Colonel Lewis sitting
dangerously near Duncan's fellow-attor
ney.
"What are you doing there?" Duncan
demanded. "Get away. Go and sit back
by the railing. You're looking at my
paper."
Colonel Lewis moved. A ripple of mirth
stirred the court room.
In the testimony introduced by the de
fendants to show their title to the goods
in question was a deposition by Sarah D.
.Burnett of Brooks, Ky. She said she was
a first cousin of Colonel Duncan and knew
Mary T. Duncan very well. The deposi
tion showed that all the table silver and
certain other trinkets in the contest were
purchased many years ago in Louisville,
Ky.. by Mary T. Duncan, who later be
queathed them to her daughter, Kate
Lewis. Mrs. Burnett was aware that this
silver was in Mrs. Lewis* possession up to
July. 1S97, at which time she was visiting
at the Lewis home in. this city.
Court Frowns Upon Him.
When he stepped down from the stand
Colonel Duncan emptied all the law books
out of his iron box. piling them up in a
great heap on the table before him. There
were Kentucky tomes and California re
ports, codes or procedure, authorities on
evidence and a veritable library of legal
lore.
"What are you going to do with all
those books?" inquired Judge Ballard,
glpncing hopefully at the clock.
"If the court please." began Colonel
Duncan, "I am going to read to you the
decisions of the Supreme Court of. Ken
tucky, as well as the decisions of th'j Su
preme Court of California, upon cases
similar to this."
"No, you're not going to do any such
thing," said Judge Ballard. "You have
not rested the case yet. I shall not allow
the reading of all those authorities to be
introduced as evidence. If you are hound
to make use of them you will have to do
bo during your argument of the case and
not before. My impression is that very
little argument will be required."
Judge Ballard's remarks indicate â¢ that
his verdict will be in favor of Mrs. Lewis.

MEMPHIS, Tcnn.. May 29.â A beautiful
Bight was the floral parade with which the
citizens of Memphis this afternoon hon

were marsi's of flowers, were in line, and
all the citizens of Memphis who witnessed
the flower parade given last year in honor
of Admiral Dewey agreed that the event
to-day far surpassed the first attempt.
At the business session of the United
Confederate Veterans the report of the
historical committee was unanimously
adopted. It stated that the chief impedi
ment to the preparation and reception of
a history impartially dealing with both
gldes of the war is prejudice. It added:
"Probably the generation now passing
a'way will never completely outlive the
prejudices engendered by the war and the
contentions and misapprehensions which
led to it. The passions and prejudices
aroused by the war threatened to Jmplant
sectional animosities which time could
never heal.
"We Southern people once regarded
Abraham Uncoln as one of the most des
picable creatures that ever lived. Now,
whlU we do not indorse the policy which
he pursued, we honor him for his unques
tioned sincerity, patriotism and ability.
On the other hand, the people of the
North once regarded Jefferson Davis as
the incarnation of selfishness and disloy
alty. Now, wherever disabused of preju
dices, they rcpard him. using the lan
tfu.'are of one of their ablest scholars, as
one of the "purest, ablest, most patriotic

CONVENING OF CONGRESS AVOIDED
That the university should be a center of co
operating research was a, vital element ot Mr.
Stanford's plans. A man content with * the
truth that now is and without . ambition - to
venture Into tho unknown should not hold the
chair of university professor. The Incentive
for research should Â¦ be within, not without.
Its motive . should not be the desire of In
dividual fame, but the love of knowledge.
â¢ In proportion to the extent - to which It
widens the range of human knowledge and of
human t>ower. in' that degree does an Insti
tution deserve the name of university.: The
value of its original work Is the beat' single
test by I which a university may hi Judged,
and as it is the best so Is it also the severest.
In Its -nubile relations the university stands
for infinite patience, the calm testing of ideas
and ideals. It conducts no propaganda, it con
trols no affairs of business or of public action.
It is the Judge of the principles of wisdom and
the ways of. nature. The details of action It
Tnust' leave . to men whose business it is to
j-ulde' the currents of the moment. ' - Â¦_Â¦
\ When â¢ Leland' " Stanford ' Junior University
was founded it. was. provided -.that in its reli
gious life, as In Us scientific . Investigations,
It (should be wholly free -from' outside control:
No religious sect or organization and no grouD
I . . Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦ *> Â¦ t -> ,- ' , MUM L - ... ;- 1 i
Incentive for Itesearch.
. That women should receive higher education
as well as men was an axiom with Mr. Stan
ford. Oo-educatlon was taken for granted from
the firat. and the younp women of Stanford
have never had to question the friendliness of
their welcome. '
"We have provided." Mr. Stanford says, "In
the articles of endowment that the education
of the sexes ghall bo equal, deeming It of
Hpecial Imoortance that those who are to be
the mothers of a future generation shall be
fitted to mold and direct the Infantile mind at
Its moot critical period."
That the new university would In time at
tract great numbers of students, Mr. Stanford
believed as a matter of course, although he
found few California teachers who shared this
optimism. ' Hut he was never deceived with the
cheap test of numbers In estimating the value
of Institutions.
He knew that . a few hundred men welt
trained and under high Influences would count
for more than as many thousands hurried in
droves over a ready-made curriculum by young;
tutors themselves scarcely out of college. So
If Was decreed fhat numbers for members'
sake should never be a Koal of Stanford Uni
versity. And he further made the practical
request that not' one dollar.dlrectly or indi
rectly Hhould be spent In advertising:. The
university has no goods for which it is nnx
lous to find customers.
Mr. Stanford Insisted as a vital principle
that' the university exists for the benefit of Its
students, past, present and tuture. It has no
existence or function save as, an Instrument of
education. To this principle ell others should
be subordinate. Â¦ In his opening address Mr.
Stanford said to the students of the pioneer
class: "You are the most important factor In
this university. It In for your benefit that It
has been established."
Tltft greatest need of the student Is the
teacher Â¦ Mr. Stanford said:. "In order that
the ureclilent may have the assistance of a
competent start of professor*, we have provided
that the best talent obtainable shall be pro
curÂ»d nnd that llbenU comce'nBatlon fIi.iII nl
ways be offered." Again he said: "Ample en
dowment may have been provided, Intelligent
management 'may secure lanre income, stu
dents may present themselves in numbers, but
In the end the faculty makes or mars the uni
versity." '
Compared with the character of the faculty
every other element In the university Is of
relatively little Importance. Great teachers
make a university great. Tho chief duty of
the college president is the choice of teachers.
If hÂ« has learned the art of surrounding him
self with men who are clean, sane and schol
arly, all other matters of university adminis
tration will take care of themselves. He can
not fall If he has good men around him. And
In the choice of teachers the clement Â¦ of per
sonal sanity seemed of first Importance to Mr.
Stanfordâ the ability to see things as they are.
The university chair should be a center of
clear, seeln*. from which right acting should
radiate. . â¢ Â¦ .:;.-.
Believed In Co-Education.
Mr. Stanford's belief that literature and en
gineering should be pursued side by side was
shown by his wUh to -provide for both with
equal generosity. And the students of each
are the gainers by this relation. The devotee
of classical culture Is strengthened by his
association with men with whom their college
work is part of the serious duty of life. The
student of engineering stands with both feet
on the ground. His success In life depends on
the exactness of his knowledge of machinery
and of the basic prlndDles of mechanics and
mathematics. He must be In dead earnest If
he would succeed at all. On. the other hand,
the student of realities gains by his associa
tion with the poet, the philosopher and the
artist. The flner aspects of life are brought
to his notice, and from this association results
tolerance and breadth of sympathy. .
Mr. Stanford shared with Agasslz the Idea
that the essential part of education was a thor
ough knowledge of some one thing, so firmly
held as to be effective for practical results. He
believed In early choice of profession, in so far
as early choice could be wlee choice. The course
of study, however broad and however long,
should, in all its parts, look toward the - final
end of effective life. The profession chosen
early. gives a purpose and stimulus. to all the
intermediate courses of study. He saw clearly
the need of Individualism In education and that
courses of study should be built around the in
dividual man as he is. The supposed nwds of
the average man as develoi>ed by a consensus
of educational philosophers do not suffice for
the actual man as he la In actual life. We must
be- fed by food that is good for us. It is for
us that it must be adapted, not for some aver
age man In some average age. The ready-made
curriculum belongs to the same category at
ready-made clothing. It is something cheap
and easy for the man without individual needs.
tinctly the absolute democracy of knowledge.
The earlier .traditions of Cornell pointed in this
direction and for this reason Mr. Stanford
found In Cornell rather than In Harvard, Yale,
Johns Hopkins or Michigan the nearest exist
ing approach to his own ideal. It was Ezra
Cornell's hope "to foiind an Institution where
any ( person could find Instruction In any
study." Cornell and Stanford, In so far as
they are loyal to these traditions, know neither
favored students nor favored studies. No class
of men are chosen, to the exclusion of others,
and no class of studies Is given a fallacious
Importance through force of academic pressure
or through inertia of academic tradition. While
variouskinds of knowledge are of varying worth
to different persons, each has its own value to
the world, and the value to the Individual must
be determined in each case toy itself. The uni
versity should be no reÂ»rector of persons. It Is
not called on to approve 01 condemn the various
orders of genius' that come to It for training.
There has been no greater hindrance to educa
tional progress than the hierarchy of studies,
the fiction that certain kinds of work had an
invisible value not to be measured by tangible
results.
As a practical man, accustomed to go to the
he&rt of things, Mr. Stanford had little respect
for educational millinery and for the conven
tionalities which have grown up in Â¦ or about
the. great institutions ct the Old World. He
saw clearly the value of 1 thoroughness, the
need of freedom, tho Individuality of develop
ment, but cared little . for the machinery by
which these ends were ochleved. So it was de
creed that the, new university should be simple
in its organization, with only those details of
structure which the needs of the times should
develop within It. It must, have precedents
and tradltlonsi.lt must make Its own." . ;
"I would , have , this â¢institution,'' he said,
'.â¢help to fit men and; women -for usefulness in,
this life by Increasing their Individual power
of production, and by,' making them good com
pany for themselves and others.", '. Â¦?Â¦ .?: -
Â¦ No â¢ other university , has recognized ao dis-
Democracy of Knowledge.
The need to train hiÂ» own Â«on first turned
Mr. Stanford's thoughts to educational mat
ter*. His early acquaintance with Professor
AgasaU, perhaps the greatest of American
teachers, helped to direct these thoughts into
channels of wisdom. From Agasslz he derived
a realizing sense of the possibilities of human
knowledge and the impelling force of man'a
intellectual needs, that hunger and thirst af
ter truth which only the student knows,
"Man's physical needs are' slight," he said,
"but his Intellectual needs are bounded only
by his capacity to conceive." Â¦
In the darkneÂ«a of bereavement the thought
came to Mr. Stanford that ' the duty of hW
life phould be to carry out his plans of educat
ing his own Â«on into effect for the sons of
others. After the long .vigil of a dreary night
he awoko with these words on his lljÂ»s. "The
children of California â¢hall; be my children,"
And with characteristic energy ho made this
vision fact. Articles of endowmenV were
drawn up, lands and buildings and -teacher*
were provided, and on the first day of October,
18!)1, the new university opened its doors to
tho children of California and to those of the
rest of the world as well.
With all bright auspices of earth and sky, of
hope and purpose, of wealth and generosity,
the new university began. â¢ In Its history ull
who are here to-day have taken some part.
With many of ub it represents the best portion
of our llvee.' Of this I do not now. wish to speak,
but rather to discuss the original Impulse of
the founder. What was Leland Stanford's Idea
of a university, Its work and life?
We learn flntt that he would le&ve the uni
versity free to grow with the coming ages. He
would extend no dead hand from the grave to
limit its activities or to control Its movements.
The deed of gift Is In furor of education pure
and simple. It has no hampering clause, and
the only end In view is that of the help of hu
manity through the extension of knowledge, :
"We hope," he says, "that this Institution
â¢will endure through ages. Provisions regard-
Ing details of management, however wise they
rr.ay be at. present, might prove to be mis
chievous under conditions which may arise in
the future." ,' Â¦â¢Â¦â¢ 1 ,. â¢â¢.** :'i--, ;>
In our own university the Initial impulse
came from tho heart and brain of Leland
Stanford. The Ideals It has upheld were his
before they were ours. They had been care
fully wrought out In his mind before he called
like-minded men to his service to carry them
into action. It Is well once in a while to
Leland Stanford's Ideals.
For the broad principles of education, .all
universities stand, but each one works out
Its function in Us own fashion. It is this
fashion, this turn of method which sets off
one from another, which gives it Its individual
character. What this character shall be no
one force can determine. Its final coursÂ« '.a
the resultant of the initial impulse, the ideals
it develops, and the resistance of Its surround
ings. No one influence can control the final
outcome. No one will can determine the re
sult, where a thousand other wills are also
active. Nor is thn environment finally potent.
Environment is Inert, except as the Individual
wills are pitted against it.
Of this right use of money your lives and
mine have been in large degree a . product.
This fact gives me the theme of my discourse
this morning, the work of Leland Stanford Jr.
University as it existed in the mind of the
founder before teachers or students came to
Palo Alto to make it real.
Our university Is now Just ten years old. Of
all foundations In America it Is the youngest
save oneâ the University of Chicago. Yet, as
universities go, in our New World, It has at
tained its majority. It is old enough to have
a character and to be Judged by it.
To the founder of a university a kindred sat
isfaction is given, and not' for a day or a
period only, but for "changing cycles of
years." It Is his part Ho exchange gold for
abundance of life. It Is his to work mightily
In the affairs of men centuries after his per
sonal opinions and Influence lye forgotten. The
moral value of the possession of wealth lies
in the use to which It Is put There can be
no better use than that of making young met:
and women wise and clean and strong.
On? of th ! greatest of the Joys we call
academic Is that of looking Into the eyes of
young men md young ' women with the feel
ing that soi 10 small part at least of their
strength is tne work of our own minds and
hearts. Something of the teacher we see in
the student, and from master to pupil there is
a chain of heredity an real If not as literally
exact as the bodily likeness that runs in the
blood. â¢ -
It is my pleasant duty once again to wel
come a body of young men and young: women
into the ever- widening circle of Stanford alum
ni. The certificates' I have Just placed in your
hands testify to our confidence In your ability
and your purposes. In our eyes, you, like
those who have parsed before you, are youth
of promise. We have done the best we know
in aiding you in â¢ your preparation for useful
ness. The n tt lies in your own hands.
The address to the graduating class by
President Jordan was upon "The Educa
tional Ideals of Leland Stanford." It is
a magnificent presental of the wisdom and
munificence of the revered founder of the
university and reveals a side of Senator
Stanford's character that has not hitherto
been dwelt upon. He spoke as follows:
Dr. Jordan's Address.
At the close of Professor Richardson's
address President Jordan conferred the
degrees, the members, of the class pass
ing before him on the rostrum to receive
their diplomas. For the first time the de
gree of Bachelor of Laws was conferred.
The sole recipient of this honor was J. T.
Burcham, '97, and he was accorded due
honors for the distinction by the storm of
applause which greeted him when the de
gree was conferred.
Education is something like a contagious
disease and your diploma is merely a certifi
cate that you have been exposed ; to an 'educa
tion. It does not by any means signify that
you took It. Even In the colleges where the
standard of scholarship Is the highest some
are bound to get through who are not really
educated.
Tfle Individual must depend upon his own
effort for success. No matter how ! fine may
be his equipment and professors, . they cannot
take the place of work on his part. Nothing
worth while can be gained without work. All
that education does is to place us at the long
end of the lever of work, so that our efforts
are better directed, - hence more ! effective.
The thorough study of any subject awakens
the Interest of the student. He who has gone
to the bottom of a science has a bond ot sym
pathy for every other man who has done like
wise. The mastery of one subject gives us
strength to master another.
To-day there is less false pride than ever
before. Everywhere the men who do the
world's work are receiving credit for It from
all right-minded people. It is the duty of
your alma mater to make you effective and
practical, as well as to give you somewhat of
culture. But culture Is gained by a com
bination of character and attainments. With
out both these you will not be able to fill
your place In the world.
Choose your life work with care. â¢ and as
early as possible; enter upon It with zeal;
see how much you can put Into' It, not how
much you can get out of It; be not too par
ticular about your first position, it is ending
well that counts.
In the absence of Professor George M.
Richardson, who was unable to' attend on
account of sickness, the commencement
address was read for him by Professor A.
T. Murray. The subject was "The Gospel
of Work," and it was a strong presenta
tion of the value of individual effort in
the struggle for education. He said in
part: - , . , - . .

TACOMA, May 29.â White Horse, Alas
ka, has a new industry which promises
to be more profitable to its owners than
even the gold and copper mines tributary
to the Upper Yukon. It comprises the
first and only brickyard in Alaska, which
is now making brick on a large scale for
shipment down the Yukon on scows to
Dawson. The business is being operated
by B. P. Whitney and C. J. Young, the
latter having discovered a mountain of
clay suitable for making red brick a short
distance west of White Horse. Dawson
builders offer a large price for the brick,
their desire being to erect buildings that
cannot be destroyed the next time a fire
sweeps through the Klondike capital. A
portion of the product will be shipped to
Skaguay. A dozen scows are being built,

BOONEVILLE, Mo., May 29.â The
Laurine, a fourteen-ton freight boat ply
ing between Boonevllle and Rocheport, on
the Missouri River, is a complete wreck,
having been blown to pieces by explosive"
stored on board. Bert Cripe, white, of
Osceola, Mo., and Steve Wilson, col', 'cd,
of Denison, Texas, who were*emj>loye<l op
the boat and who have been' missing since
the explosion, are thought to have been
killed. Considerable damage to adjoining
property resulted from the explosion that
was felt for miles. The loss is heavy..
The steamer was- the property of tha
Rocheport Ferry and Packet Company
and was about ready to leave for the
works below town when the, accident oc
curred. Captain Fred Farris was in
charge. He and the other employes, with
the two exceptions noted, escaped. The
Laurine was propelled by a gasoline en
gine, and when a match was applied to
the generator, the gasoline exploded. The
captain and employes of the boat im
mediately vacated. The tire spread rapid
ly to the supply tanks filled with gasoline
and a second explosion occurred.
In the rear end of the, vessel was stored
2100 pounds of dynamite, about one hun
dred kegs of powder, eight cases of fuse
and 1000 detonating caps. When all this
exploded the Laurine was blown to frag
ments and many thousands of dollars'
worth of property in the city was de
stroyed. .' \
The ferry-boac Joseph L. Stephens, ly
ing 500 yards above the scene of the dis
aster, was badly damaged, the woodwork
of the upper deck and pilot house being
torn into kindling wood. All escaped from
the ferry. The damage to the ferry Is es
timated at H500.
Three residences, belonging to Joe
Sherrer, Â¦ Mrs. Sally H. Johnson and
Charles Dunkle, about COO yards from the
scene of the disaster, were wrecked at a
loss of several hundred dollars. Fifteen
plate glass windows in business houtes on
Main street, a half mile away, wore
broken and nearly all of the windows and
glass doors for a mile surroundinc the
scene of the accident were smashed by
the concussion.

SAN JOSE, May 29.â The Hip Sing Tong
highbinders have their hatchets and guns
out for Fong Ling, their erstwhile chief
ta n A v and should he be found no quarter
will be shown him. This turning of the
faithful on their leader is due to Fong's
surreptitiously departing with several
thousand dollars the tong had collected
iJ"oinvarious merchants. Estimates place
the defalcation at from $3000 to J16.000, but
the former sum is probably nearer correct.
Fong s record is a bad one and nearly all
the Chinese highbinder wars of this citv
are charged to him. He is now believed
to be on a steamer on his way to China.
The police are glad to get rid of him and
the. clamoring hatchetmen . receive little
consolation from the authorities
Fong had full .charge of all the finances
of the Hi Pj Sing Tong.- An investigation
was caused by Fong not . paying some
attorney tees [ that I were incurred in de
fending the highbinders. The president of
the society evidently feared the exposure
and fled. Further investigation showed
no returns^ had been made - to the San
Francisco branch, and very few bills paid
and that Fong was short thousands - of
dollars.

Cairnes' friends had not been idle, and
their efforts resulted to-day in the filing
of a series of affidavits with Mayor Prary.
In these was related what Commissioner
Carter had said about his intention to
oust the Chief and about it being a per
sonal matter between himself and the
Chief. These affidavits were accompanied
by a long petition signed by business men,
asking Mayor Frary to take such action
as he might deem proper to prevent the
carr>ing out of the plan.
When Mayor Frary received the peti
tion and the affidavits he sent a notifica
tion to Mr. Carter removing him from'
office. Carter will appeal to the courts.
SAN DIEGO, May 29.â Mayor Frary
took a hand to-day in the squabble in the
San Diego Fire Department in 'a manner
which was something of a surprise to the
Commissioners. Some months ago, on ac
count of a difference of opinion between
Chief Cairnes, and two of the Commission
ers, an effort was made to depose the
Chief. It failed through overhaste on the
part of one of the Commissioners and a
writ of certiorari resulted in placing Mr.
Cairnes back in charge. It has been un
derstood since then that when Cairnes'
term of office expired he would not be re
elected. This was the day when his suc
cessor was to have been elected for the
ensuing- two years.

"I was educated in Europe." he said;
"so I know tho good institutions like the

Some of my people like the missions, but
the pure Chinese are afraid of them.
Those who want to go I am willing should
go, but I don't like to see Chinese forced
into the institution. Those who want
their children brought up in accordance

but those who revere the old customs of

brought to the consulate that I might
vouch that she did not escape while her
papers were b^ing returned to China for

was against hia wish that the child should
become u Christian, he said. He would
have her follow tho beaten path that mil
lions of his people tread In the footsteps
of Confucius. He would have her revere
the memory of her ancestors, that some
day her bones may rest among theirs in
the tombs of the land of her birth.
Leaving the stand, the child leaped into
Miss Cameron's arms, where, at least for
the time, she knew she was safe. Judge
Coffey ordered the case continued until
Friday, when Gin Leung Gow will take
the stand and voice his prejudices against
the religion of the "white devils" and ex
tol the virtues of the teachings of Con
fucius, which he is confident are best
suited to the spiritual needs of little Kum
Ying.
Gin Leung Gow listened attentively, but
made no comment. When little Kum Ying
was called to the stand, however, he
walked to the bar and fiownlngly watched
her as she refuted his claim that he was
her father. Interpreter Dong Gong held
up her tiny, scarred arm while she was
being sworn, and then, as she lisped her
story in Cantonese, repeated it after her
in English.
She said she was born in Canton, and at
the age of two years, her parents being
dead, she was sold and finally became a
chattel in the hands of Gin Leung Gow.
Coming over on the steamer she. was
taught to say that Gin Leung Gow was
her father. They also taught her that she
must bow when she saw the Imperial
Consul General. She was a slave in Gin
Leung Gow'b home, she continued. She
did not addres3 him as her father, but as
her master. She washed clothes and
cooked and cared for a home occupied by
a family of five, she said, and when weary
from her labors and unable to finish in
time she would be cruelly tortured, some
times with burning sticks and again with
other implements. She would be tied down
and again stripped and beaten.
"If 1 must go back," she said, "I will
kill myself. There would be three people
who would beal and torture me. I want
Miss Cameron for my mother. ' Sh6 is

This girl is Hazel Ross, a 14-year-old
orphan, who has been making her home
with Mrs. Frost on North Fifth street.
She was treated with every consideration
and given the opportunities of a daughter.
On several occasions she came home with
bicycles, but as she never gave a very
satisfactory explanation the wheels wer?
put aside and finally returned to the own
ers. Yesterday she stole a wheel from the
Normal School grounds. She was identi

was reported to the police. They recov

but the Ross girl could not be found. Sh-i

took somebody else's wheel with her.
SAX JOSE, May 29.â San Jose has a girl

ADVERTISEMENTS.
NO MAN IS STRONGER
' HDW HIS STOMACH
The stomach is the vital 'center of the
body. It is the organ from which all
other organs are fed. A weak stomach
means a weak man. There never was a
strong man '.vitli a weak stomach. What
is called " weak stomach " is in general a
diseased condition of the stomach and
other organs of digestion and nutrition,
which prevents the proper digestion of
the food which is taken into the stom-
ach, and so reduces the nutrition of . the
body. , When all food is taken away the
body starves. When the food eaten is
only digested and assimilated in part it
only nourishes the body in part, and so
the body is partly, starved. And this
starvation is felt in every organ of the
body dependent on the blood which is
made-from food.
The great* variety of the cures per-
formed by Dr. Pierce's Golden ' Medical
Discovery i3 due to its remarkable
,power-to heal diseases of the stomach
and allied organs. It cures through the
stomach diseases seemingly remote, but
which have their origin in a- diseased
condition of the stomach 'and the other
organs of digestion and . nutrition."
Â« Weak " heart, lungs, kidneys and weak-
ness of other organs is cured with the
cure of the weak stomach. ' j
Mr. Thomas A. Swarts, Box 103, Sub-Station
C, Columbus. Ohio, writes:- Â«I was taken very
sick with severe headache; then cramps in .the
stomach, and food would not* digest, then kidney
and liver trouble, and my back got weald so I
could scarcely yet around. The more I doctored
the worse I got uutil six years passed. I had be-
Â¦ come so poorly I could only walk in the house',
by the aid of a chair, and I got so thin I had
given up to die, thinking that I could not be
cured. Then one of my neighbors said, '.Take
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and make
a new man out of yourself.' The first bottle
helped me so I thought I would get another, and
: after I had taken eight bottles I was weighed
and found I had gained twenty-seven (27) lbs. .
in about six weeks. I have done more hard,
work in the oast eleven * months than I did In;
two years before, and I am as stout and healthy Â¦â¢
to-day, I think, as I ever was.". " . .

Tennis Championship.
.CHICAGO, May 29.â The .Western. Inter
collegiate tennis championship ,m both
singles and doubles will go'to two players
from the University' of Michigan this
year. The championship in loublcs i was
won by; Dan forth and Wherry- of Michi
gan, who defeated Axtell and Gingham,
of the University of Chicago, and the
final in singles will be decided to-morrow
between Danforth and Wherry, who de
feated all the other contestants.
Whitney Brothers Will Go to Chicago
to Flay Eastern Tennis
Champions.
A scratch singles tournament for the
championship of San Francisco will be
played this morning at 10:30 o'clock on
the courts of the California Tennis .Club.
This. is the largest and most Important
tournament held on theso courts for sev
eral years. Four handsome prizes have
been offered, three by the club and one by
Clabrough, Golcher<% Co.
The drawing, held last evening, re3uited
as follows:
Merle Johnson vs. A. Allen (of Woodland);
Sidney Salisbury vs. Chet Smith; George Whit
ney vb. Carl Gardner; Charles Kuehn vs. Nor
rhan Hodsklnson :*Fred Brown (Oakland), vs.
John' Craig (of woodland); ,-Ray ', Cornell vs.
Grant Smith; James Code vs. Drummond Mo-
Gavin; R. N. Whitney vs. Harold Crowell.
George Whitney will surely win '/first
prize, and from tho drawing It looks as If
second-prize would- go to either Bob Whit
ney, Fred Brown or Grant Smith.
The Whitney brothers have received an
offer from J. P. Gardner of the Kenwood
Country Club, Chicago, to go back East
in July and play in the Western cham
pionship for both singles and doubles. The
offer Is entirely satisfactory to the Whit
neys and they will undoubtedly go." Last
year the Hardys accepted the same offer
and made a very fair snowing in the East.
With. George to play the singles and hla
brother to help liim out in the doubles
they should make an even better showing
than the Hardys did. Should they be suc
cessful in. this tournament, they would be
eligible to play at Newport for the cham
pionship of the United States.
SINGLES TOURNAMENT
ON CALIFORNIA COURTS
McFadden was aggressive, hut Dougher
ty's great cleverness was more than a
Ptand-off. The Eastern boxer outpointed
the local lad two to one. He retreated
throughout the bout, but It was the move
of a skilled ring general". Dougherty
blocked in a masterly fashion, and his
left-hand leads played havoc with McFad
den's face in the early part of the battle.
Near the close the Kid became wary and
had his glove up to stop the repeated jabs
that were aimed at his face
McFadden assumed the aggressive in
the first round and followed the shifty
Dougherty all over the ring, .swinging
hard, but missing repeatedly. Dougherty
used his left to advantage and soon had
McKadden'e nose red. In the second the
Kid scored a knockdown that wau due
more to a slip than a punch. Dougherty
wan upon his fret in a Mash and the two
r-ngaged in a give-and-take tight that
aroused the epectatoâ¢ to a high pitch of
excitement. Dougherty had MeFadden
bleeding from nose anil mouth in the next
round from straight left JabÂ«. McFad
den took the punishment and was con
tinually after his man, in tho fourth the
Kid net the pace. Doueherty nursed his
strength and kept on the retreat.
. The fifth round wo* tamo in comparison
Dougherty Wins.
AURELIO HERRERA should take
the first train to the oil belt
and sm^ar his fighting aspira
tions with Bakerefield unction.
Through the grace of Terry Mc-
Govern he was allowed to remain four
tour da and a fraction in -a San Francisco
ring last night, and when he realized that
he was supposed to be a fighter he fell
fast asleep on hto knees while the referee
nnd timekeepers' counted more than the
utv-al decadal allowance for impotent un
consciousness.
In the fifth round Herrera genuflected
to an accompaniment of second counts.
He might have rained himself to his feet,
but he was not in the mind for it. Not
much punishment had he received in the
foregoing rounds, but it was drastic
enough to make the yellow streak of Her
rera loom up in awful saffron tints.
There was somo betting on six roundsâ
< vi.-n money, they -said, and the. way the
ficht terminated gives color to the asser
tion that McGovern simply tolerated Her
rcra to the last line within the limit. Not
many who saw the fight last night are
of. the opinion that there were two pugil
ists among those present in the McGov
crn-Herrera mill. Terry the Terrible
from start to finish is the verdict.
jfcGovcrn did riot fight a fistic battle
that redounded to his credit. He left
himself open to attack, he was careless
of his defense and until the fifth round
displayed no inclination to force morpheal
punishment upon his antagonist. Herrera
delivered just one blow during the four
and a half rounds, and its effect was a
broad grin upon the face of the cham
pion.
Some were of the opinion that Terry
was not in condition to end the fight
sooner, that he was heavy on his feet and
could not have comported himself in bet
ter fashion. This was not so. He waited,
and when the time came it was a sad
good-day to Herrera from Bakersfleld,
whose inability and yellow propensities
made him a mark for hard punishing
lists when the time was ripe. Herrera
wan frightened nigh unto death at Â« the
Etart and simply awaited the unhappy
denouement. Even when he was supposed
to be knocked down and out the yellow
was dominant and prevented him from
rising as tho timekeepers beat the tenth
second.
At the end of the fourth spasm of fight
ing, just as the gong sounded, McGovcrn
landed on Herrera's Jaw. The elats rat
tled and the end was foreshadowed.
"Good-by" said the crowd, and good-by it
Â¦was. **Â¦
Compared with the McFadden-Dough
erty fight, which went its full limit, the
McGovern-Herrera mixup was not note
worthy of comment. The crowd, tho big
gest that has come within the Pavilion
walls since the Lavlgne-Wolcott fight,
Â¦was on its feet half the time these two
bantams were pummeling one another.
There was fight harmony in the air, and
when Phil Wand gave the ' decision to.
l>cugherty the crowd arose, cheering
wildly and vociferously to the echo.
"To my mind McGovern was taking no
chances in his fight with Herrera. He
fought carefully and at times had to ex
tend himself. Herrera is a plucky fellow.
He made a fairly good showing against
the champion and his defeat was no dis
grace. McGovern fought in his usual
Btyle, hitting in the clinches and in the
breakaway. He committed no foul to my
knowledge. Herrera pursued the same
tactics and landed frequently on Mo-
Govern. In my opinion Herrera was sim
ply outclassed."
"Dougherty was entitled to a decision
becauso ho put up the cleverest fight. He
outpointt-d McFtadden in nearly every
round and landed the .. most effective
blows. McFadden deserves considerable
credit for the fight ho put up. His work
was aggressive and ho displayed true
grit. Dougherty's groat cleverness won
him the fight. Both boys fought a clean
battle and deserved the applause they re
ceived.
Referee Phil Wand made the following
statement at tho close of tho evening's en
tertainment:
a number of more rounds. The rules stale
that when a boxer is sent to the fioor the
other man must retire to his. corner. The
referee disregarded the rules. Â¦
"I lost a considerable sum on the result
of the fight and won some money on the
fight by rounds."
REFEREE WAND TALKS
ABOUT THE FIGHT
Frank Carrilo, manager of the Bakers
fleld boxer, was highly indignant after the.
defeat of Herrera. Ho claimed that he
was treated unfairly by the referee and he
voiced his protest in' no uncertain words.
He made the following statement in the
presence of a crowd Â¦ that congregated
around Herrera's dressing room:
"Herrera was repeatedly fouled by flc-
Govern, and the referee failed to take .io
tieo of the tactics pursued by the Brook
lyn fighter. Ho hit Herrera in tho eli'.ches
after the referee. told him to break" away.
This in itself was a palpable foi;i. Mc-
Oovern should have ritnpped batK to his
corner after knocking Herrera down, lnÂ»
Htcad ho Htoort ovev my man und was on''
top of him ns noon an ho rose to his feet.
Hod Wand compelled MoOovern to go to
his corner Herrera might havo continued
MANAGER CARRILO
â¢ CLAIMS A FOUL
"Herrera is a tough fellow to knock out.
I might have ended, the battle sooner, but
he held on all. the time. I tried to knock
him out in two rounds. ' He has a good
punch and was in great shaoe. Had he
been otherwise, he could not have lasted
the way he did. I was not tired, nor \va*
I faking. I frequently fight as i did to
night. My whole mind was on landing a
right cross and I took many punches to
get in close enough to land it. Mv next
battle will be with ,Tlm Hegarty of Aus
tralia." Â«
Terry McGovern admits that ha w:n
not in the best of shape for his battle
with Herrera. He says he would have
trained more faithfully had lie thought
Herrera stood N any chance to take away
his laurels. He states that ne was in
trim for the bout, but not In the very
best of condition. This "may account for
his let-up in the third and fourth rounds.
In the opinion of many, McGovern shot
his bolt in the first two rounds and took
things easy in the third so that he could
recuperate his strength. He Jenied em
phatically that he allowed Herrera to stay
five rounds.' While being rubbed down by
his seconds, he said:
McGOVERN TRIED HARD V
FOR A KNOCKOUT BLOW
Morris Rausch, the clever Chicago ban
tam, challenged the winner.by a telegram
which was read at the close of the bout.
J. J. Dukelow and William" Fincke, the
two amateur boxers who were to make
their Initial bow as professional fighters,
did not put In an appearance. I The match
fell through, as both decided to retain
their amateur standing.

to the rounds that preceded It. McFadden
seemed to be the stronger and kept after
his man relentlessly. The boys hit,
clinched, and sparred at long range. The
sixth round was replete with long-dis
tance sparring. McFadden solved Dough
erty's left lead to mouth, and blocked
nicely. Dougherty, seeing this, played for
the gtomach, and in trying to land his left
on the wind came dangerously near being
knocked out. Both appeared tired and
their speed showed signs of diminution.
Dougherty staggered the Kid by landing
lefts on the Jaw In the seventh. The round
was all Dougherty's. - Both came up ap
parently fresh In the eighth. Dougherty's
clever work aroused much applause, espe
cially bo when he ducked out of a danger
ous position and flew at the Kid .with
both hands. They tried In-flghtlng In this
round and It was nip and tuck between
them. In a hot rally Just before the
gong sounded McFadden tripped over tho
ropes, but was up again and went smiling
ly to his corner.
McFadden opened the ninth with a rush
from his corner. He landed a heavy right
on the head and they clinched. Both' boys
began lighting hard and kept up their
earnest work until the round ended.
Dougherty seemed to havo the better' of
this round. When the gong sounded the
signal for the tenth round, tho bantams
rushed out from thoir corners and, with
tho accustomed hand-shake, renewed hos
tilities. McFadden was tho stronger of
tho two and he forced matters. Â¦ It looked
at times as If he had Dougherty going,
but the Eastern boxer was lighting back
all tho time. The round was replete in In
fighting and was as lively as any round in
the flgnt. When Â»he end came Referee
Wand, 'without* a moment's' hesitation,
awarded the contest to Dougherty.

The Oakland officials have consented to
allow Marty Bergen to accept mounts
again. There never was any ruling
against- Marty, but his form got a trifle
rusty and possibly It was thought a rest
would sharpen him up. The old-time rider
has had sickness in his family and has
otherwise been pecuniarily distressed, and
while not the rider of former years un
doubtedly deals out the best he has.
Russell, who rode Coal Oil Johnny, had
his leg bruised by being crowded against
the inner rail about three furlongs from

La Calma was the favorite In the second
race, selling for a $300 purse over one mhe
and a fifty yards tacked on, but there
never was a moment when she gave Posi
tion aii argument. Tho latter was well
handled bv> Alexander along the back

aspirants startedâ Rey Dare, Rosormonde,
Byron Rose and Prejudice. Tho last was
a 6 to 6 favorite, with plenty of backing,
but Rey Dare wore blinds and Rained a
superstitious support on that account.
Tho itart, which was a fair one, showed
Rosormonde and Prejudice to the fore, Rey
Dare being cut off. But It was just this
fact that' was Instrumental In securing tho
first money for the colt that George Webb
has been training for the last six months.

ABOU T NOYES
Clerk of the Nome Judge
Testifies as to His
Acts.
Is Oblivious and Ignorant
Regarding Matters of
Contempt. *
In response to a citation Issued by th*
United States Circuit Court of Appeal*
Archibald Wheeler, stenographer for
Judge Noyes of tho Federal district of
Alnnka, appeared before Â¦ United States
Court Commlsmioner Ileacock yesterday
afternoon to teatify in the contempt cases,
now before tho Court of Appeal*, F. D.
Madison- appeared on behalf of E. 8. Pills,
bury, amtcus curlae. and Thomas J. Geary
appeared to protect his own interests.
Mr. Wheeler testified that he was an
attorney and resided in - Minneapolis.
Minn., although since he left his employ
ment in that city to accompany Judge
Noyes to Nomo as his private clerk ha
had not practiced lew except in a few
cases last September In Alaska.
After that time his salary us clerk for
the Judge was fixed by the Attorney Gen
eral's department and he discontinued
practicing his profession.
When the writs of supesedeas Issued by
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals were received by Judge Noyes be
handed them to Wheeler, remarking at
the same time that it was the practice in
such cases to issue an order staying pro
ceedings in the mining cases. The Judgs
thereupon dictated an order staying pro
ceedings, which the witness took down
in shorthand and afterward transcribed
on the typewriter. The witness never
heard Judge Noyes discuss the orders of
the Court of Appeals or the court Itself,
nor was he present at the meetings be
tween Judge Noyes, Hubbard and others
In which Judge Noyes is reported to have
said that the order appointing a receiver
was not appealable.
"Were you," asked Mr. Madden, "pres
ent when Judge Noyes said: 'By - â , I
hope that McKinley Is elected; I'll fix
those fellows' "? â¢
"No, sir," replied the witness.
"Did you eyer hear Judge Noyes say
that Judgtf Morrow was a fool or was
oelng fooled by parties In San Fran
cisco?"
"No. sir." â¢ Â¦ Â¦ V
The witness was asked with respect to
an order issued by Judge Noyes in the
form of a letter addressed to the United
States Marshal, commanding the Marshal
to protect life and property and preserve
peace and order In the town of Nome. At
that time there was danger of a riot
among the miners. The letter did not con
tain anything with regard to any gold
dust. It was simply a personal letter, and
the witness did not remember seeing Alex
ander McKenzle's name written In It at
all, or any instruction to prevent Mc-
Kenzie from having access to the vaults
in which the gold dust was kept.
Mr. Geary remarked that If the town of
Nome was destroyed by fire and all the
records were lost he would produce every
paper connected with tho contempt cases
in the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals by October 14, the date fixed In the
order to show cause.
The witness, resuming, said that ho did
not know of any orders issued by Judgo
Noyes impeding tho carrying out of thÂ»
write of supersedeas.
The witness added th?.t although he had
been present at several conversations be
tween Judge Noyes and ex-Congressman
Geary he had never heard them discus*
the writs of superscdeaa. He was not
present, he said, when General Randall,
Judge Noyes and others were suggesting
the removal of the gold dust to 'St. Paul
or elsewhere, if any such conversation
ever did take place. Mr. Wheeler admit
ted that he took a letter from Judge
Noyes to Major Van Arsdale just before
the soldiers were detailed to guard tho
vaults, bat he did not know tho contents
of the letter. Â¦
The further taking of testimony was de
ferred until June 10.

NEW YORK, May 29.â A. H.~ Leslie of
Pittsburg presided at the second day's
session of the Association of Police Chiefs.
The committee on membership made it3
report and the remainder of the session
was spent in the reading of papers.
Chief Deitsch of Cincinnati read a long
paper on police organization and discip
line, the prevention of crime and the
treatment of criminals. The paper dis
cussed the question of the social evil and
favored localization and careful control.
Objection was made to the paper, and
after some confusion an attempt was
made to shut it off by vote. The conven
tion decided to hear it through, however,
and it was read. Chief Deitsch in his pa
pÂ«r, referring to money paid for police
protection, said:
"A man who profits in this way is noth
ing less than a common loafer. He should
be publicly disgraced and sent to the
workhouse. A poor devil who steals. to
satisfy his hunger or to keep his family
from the workhouse. is far superior."
This statement started a ripple. Chief
Jansen of Milwaukee jumped to his. feet
and moved "that this portion of Colonel
Deltsch's paper, be not read; that it be
discussed in executive session or spread
upon the minutes without reading."
Somebody seconded the motion and Chief
Kiely of St. Ix>uis protested.
"I object,"- he said. "We cannot dodge
the subject. It is not fair. I should like
to hear all Colonel Deitsch has to say."
Chief Jansen argued that there was a
Controversy at Associa
tion Meeting in New
York.
POLICE CHIEF
MAKES CHARGES
The proposition briefly is this: That every
well should hold one share or stock: that is,
every owner of a well should hold as many
shares as he has wells. This ownership of
stock in the corporation gives to the holder,
first, the privilege of access to all the in
formation and valuable data that the associa
tion will work out from time to time, and the
further right to pool his oil with others in the
association, if he so desires, and a voice In its
councils: The purpose of the association is
net only to formulate a plan for handling the
oil, but to work out new markets and stimulate
consumption of the product in every way pos
sible; and every holder of a share in the cor
poration is entitled to the information thus ob
tained i and to valuable data that will be on
file in the association office. The only obliga
tion that you will assume in subscribing for the
stock is that you agree to give the association
your moral support. . /*
The Los Angeles Oil Producers' Asso
ciation has appointed a committee to dis
pose of the oil produced in the local field,
and the plan for handling the oil will soon
be evolved. In a emmunication sent out
by the membership committee, the follow
ing is set forth:
Developing Plans.
According to the Tri "Weekly Promoter,
there are two companies now operating in
Glenn County, and within sixty days six
drills will be sinking for oil.
' The California oil depression never touched
us.- Active development goes on the same as
ever. Two new 400-foot oil wharves have been
built during the past month, some new terri
tory explored and found good, other new ter
ritory is in course of exploitation, six drilling
rigs working night and day. Summerland oil
In demand at three times the price paid for
it in Bakersfield. and last, but not least, a new
asphalt refinery, briefly sums up the situation
in the local Held. " â¢'Â¦;-;Â¦
Several companies that suspended oper
ations some time ago, have since then re
sumed. Among these is the Monarch
Company, the in the San Diego
field, which stopped when a hole had been
drilled 1110 feet. The Hesperian Oil Com
pany In Butte County has also resumed,
according to the Chico Record. .
. The Summerland Advance-Courier has
the following cheerful news concerning
the oil industry in Summerland:
Companies Resume Work.
Some months since a movement was started
among the oil producers of Kern County to
organize the Producers' Oil Storage and Trans
portation Company. The organization did not
lapse, and the fact is not' generally known that
lc has established an. office in this city, where
it is making- contracts for the sale of the
product of the Kern River field, particularly for
shipment to Arizona mining sections. It 'is
not believed that any efforts are made to sup
plant the product - of the local Â¦ field In . the
home market, but a considerable trade is be
ing worked up in Arizona, and Los Angeles is
looked to as the natural center of the oil in
dustry for that section and the office here is
the central point for southern trade. While
this company t is composed of but a few men
compared with the . number of producers, it
represents strong interests, and is alone an im
portant factor In the oil market of the State.
G. F. Wendling is the general manager of the
company, the officers being as- follows: Presi
dent. C. A. Canfleld; first vice president, W.
K. Knowles; second vice .president, H. A.
Blodgett; secretary, "W. D. Morrison; direc
tors, M. J. Laymance, H. H. Blood, O. Scrib
ner, T. Spellacy, W. C. Price, B. F. Brooks
and I. Strassburger. The 'organization of this
company and its entrance into the active work
of marketing oil throughout the State and .the
adjoining Territories, representing as It does a
number of the largest operators in Kern
County, is an indication of the tendency of the
times in the oil industry of the State to cen
tralize on the question of marketing.
Kern River oil producers are . invading
the Arizona market, which the Lcs An
geles producers had supposed to-be thoir
Held. The Los Angeles papers are paying
considerable attention to. this move. The
Los Angeles Herald says: .
Southern Field Invaded.
Secretary Musaus reports that the oil
producing companies north of Tehachapi
are favoring strongly the - organization
plan that has been submitted to them,
There was some misunderstanding at Iirst
as to whether approval must be signified
by vote of the directors of ihe various
cpmpanlea. The prospect for perfecting
the organization soon is good.
Additional parties are seeking: oil in the
sands of California deserts. Onerornyany
has a record of locating 27,000 acres in the
northern part of the Carriso Creek bco
tion. Fourteen , persons with â¢ tcam3, left
San Diego a few days ago for' the Carrlao
Creek district, representing the Dsguino
Oil Company, which haa , filed on lands
"north of those taken up by the San Diego
Desert ' Oil Company.- The party took
tents, a water outfit and camp equipage.
Two surveyors were engaged to run lines
and rectify errors in former surveys, and
each surveyor had three assistants. The
expectation is that the | party, will be on
the desert until early in July. Â¦.

J. White.
The line is under the direct supervision
of Mr. P. Morris, the general manager,
with headquarters at Chinese Camp, one
of the best known stage men in the State.
The stage trip occupies only eleven and
a half hours and is delightful throughout.
Since the completion of the Sierra Rail
way to Chinese Station the Big Oak Flat
stage route from that point to the Yo
semite Valley has enjoyed a large share
of the Yosemite travel. The line of stages
is well equipped for the comfort of pas
sengers and passes through one of the
most picturesque routes to the valley. The
eye is continually attracted by changing
views of wonderful beauty, and in addi
tion to viewing the groves of mammoth
trees travelers have an opportunity of
seeing gold mines in active operation,
where. ponderous stamps crush the prec
ious metal. Many of the names of sta
tions or. the line are identified with the
early mining history of California and are
familiar to every one. 4 The stages pass

The Archbishop's address to the boys
was a most earnest one. "The Catholic
college," said he, "stands for Catholic
morality, and if the graduates would
prove their love for their alma mater they
must lead such lives as would reflect
credit on it. V\
"The education you have received,"
continued his Grace, "as far as It is sec
ular amounts to very little, and if a .boy
thinks otherwise he closes his books and
the first you know fie is running for office
or trying to get his living at the expense
of the public."
* In conclusion the Archbishop said: "Be
yond learning there is virtue. It is better
to be good than great and better to know
God's lav/ than all the science , in the
world. Seek to be honest; seek to tell the
truth; seek to keep your word; seek to be
sober; seek to be charitable, and above all
seek to be pure of heart."

The cause of the Issuance of this order
is manifest. While a policeman's lot was
cast among the residents of the Potreto, or
where the zephyrs waft avalanches of fog
across the Sutro Heights, the color of his
hirsute adornment was the least part of
his troubles: but when the hour of his
promotion was at hand and his beat was
transferred to civilization on Market
street, matters were different. H.'s envy
was aroused when the ladites cast tlieir
"goo-goo" glances at the petite blonde
mustaches, or the profusion of jet black
curls that made idols of other "copoerb."
Then he proceeded to make himself
"solid" with the drug clerk or the hair
dresser, and he received instructions with

SAYS SHE DIDN'T
INTEND OFFENSE
Mrs. Eddy Answers the
Charges of Mrs.
Woodbury.
Â» Â¦ .
BOSTON, May 29.â The Jury trial of
Mrs. Josephine A. Woodbury of this city,
claiming 5150,000 damages from Mrs. Mary
Baker G. Eddy of Concord. N. H., founder
of ' the Christian Scientist sect, for libel,
was begun in the Suffolk County Superior
Court here, and according to the state
ment of the defendant counsel it is likely
to consume j the greater portion of three
'weeks.
The suit was brought by Mrs. Woodbury
on the ground that two years ago Mrs.
Eddy, in a message to the First Christian
Science Churcn here, which was read four
times and afterward published In a local
paper, had in mind Mrs. Woodbury when
she used the words "the doom of the
Babylonish woman referred to in the
Book of Revelations is being fulfilled."
Previous to this Mrs. Woodbury had been
excommunicated by the church;
In her answer Mrs. Eddy admits that
the particular address was delivered onÂ»
the days and at the times named in the
declaration of the plaintiff, but declares
that neither Mrs. Woodbury nor any other
human being was meant by the term
"Babylonish wciaan," the phrase being
used simply to describe a type of sin.
Mrs. Woodbury was present in court to
day. Mrs. Eddy would not appear, her
deposition having been taken for introduc
tion in the case as evidence. The court
room was crowded with spectators when
the. case was called, while several hun
dred men and women clamored in vain for
admission. Before the selection of a jury
Attorney Peabody. counsel for Mrs.
"VVoodbury, offered an affidavit bearing on
the case, whicn he claimed was made ne
cessary through the absence of Judge S.
E. Hanna. who he said, caused the mes
sage of Mrs. Eddy to be published in the
local papers. 'Che court took the affidavit
v.-ith the understanding that it should be
admitted later In the case should the evi
dence warrant it. A jury was then im
paneled and the plaintiff's declaration
read.
Peabody said that a large number of the
witnesses in the court for the defense be
lieved in Mrs. Eddy as a marvelous wo
man, second only to Christ, and that they
were prompted to stand by her through
religious motives. He asked that they be
excluded from the court-room. Judge
Bell refused to grant Peabody's request.
William F. Cross, one of the editors of
the Christian Science Journal, described
ihe positions held by Judge Hanna and
Mrs. Eddy in the society. He" testified
that he did not know where Judge Hanna
was at the present time. Witness was,
dismissed, but was stopped by Peabody
asking him if he had not refused recently
to state where Hanna was. Witness re
plied that he had. He stated that he had
been called on a telephone in a blunt and
eurly manner and that no reason for the
request had been given. He did not feel
called on to answer the questions of per
sons who said the truth was not to be
obtained at the Christian Science Journal
office. â¢ .
The first victcry on either side came to
the defense when Peabody sought by this
witness to show that Mrs. Woodbury was
the woman referred to by Mrs. Eddy in
the alleged libelous statement, on the
ground that Mrs. Woodbury had sought
and was refused admission to the "Mother
Church" in 1895, was afterward admitted
and later excommunicated. Elder object
ed to the admission of this testimony.
Peabody stated that Mrs. Eddy made the
alleged libelous declarations with a full
knowledge of the fact that they would be
construed as they were.
"We purpose." said Peabody, "to bring
before the jury all the Incidents in the
lives of Mrs. Woodbury and Mrs. Eddy,
showing their relations."
The court ruled that the time was too
remote and excluded the testimony. The
case goes on to-morrow.

1 Jn addition to illuminating oils there are other oil
exports* such as crude and lubricating oils, naphthas
land residuum. Taking these, together with the illu-
From the figures it appears the exports this year
will be the largest in the ' history of the oil industry.
In 1875 the exports of illuminating oil amounted to
204,000,000 gallons, while this year it is estimated the
export will be in excess of even the great export of
1900, which was 721,000,000 gallons. From 1876 to
1900 the total value of mineral oils exported from the
United States was about $1,200,000,000, an average of
about $48,000,000 a year, but during the later years of
that period the average has been $60,000,000 per.
annum. v . \
In reviewing the course of prices the report points
out that there has been a remarkable decrease in the
price to the consumer during the period in which the
actual exportations and the net value of the exports
have been increasing. The average, value of the illumi
nating oil exported in 1876 was about 15 cents per gal
lon, and in 1877, an exceptional year, 20 cents per gal
lon. By 1881 the price had fallen to about 10 cents per
gallon, the figures for that year being 332,000,000 gal
lons, valued at $34,000,000. By 1891 the average price
was about 7 cents per gallon, the exports of that year
having been 564,000,000 gallons, valued at $41,000,000.
By 1898 the average export price was about 5 cents per
gallon, the quantity exported having been 824,000,000
gallons, and the ! value reported to- the Bureau of
Statistics by exporters through the customs collect
ors $42,922,682. In the nine months of the present
fiscal year, for which the figures are completed, the
total exports*of illuminating oil amounted to 569,624,
751 gallons, valued at $37,939,5*4, or 6 2-3 cents per
gallon.
OWING to the public interest in the oil in
dustry occasioned by the recent discoveries of
oil wells in this State and in Texas the
Treasury Bureau of Statistics has recently compiled
for publication a. report showing the exports of oil
from the United States, together' with a review of
prices of the product for a long series of years.
OIL EXPORTS AND PRICES.
The cultivation of tobacco has been carried to such
an extent, in Wisconsin that it has been decided to
open a large public tobacco market in Milwaukee,
and the Sentinel of that city says that this year "Dane
County is the greatest tobacco-growing county in the
Union." So it will be seen that while the cotton fac
tories are moving South the tobacco market is mov
ing North, and the new era is keeping the balance
even.
As we said some time ago, the real crux of. the
whole matter appears when we come to deal , with the
issues of peace and not of war, affecting our expan
sion policy.
We are of opinion that the necessity of maintaining
a tariff against the. cheap labor and production of
Porto Rico and the Philippines will materially abridge
the commercial importance of those islands, to us.
We will no^ get the expected profits of their exploita
tion. .. Â¦ . Â¦ :â¢Â¦
' True, we may under the court's decision still further
cheapen labor in the 1 Philippines by unlimited admis
sion of low-priced Chinese coolie production, but that
will avail little if the tariff wall is raised as wages are
lowered.
, Just at present the matter is not of such importance
as may appear farther on in our history. The court
has. affirmed our right of acquisition of extraconti
nental possessions. Under such affirmation our con
quests may be limited only by our physical power to
prosecute them. They might include the British em
pire, our best customer in trade. To protect our
home labor it would be necessary to maintain a, tariff
against the products of that acquisition. But, govern
ing it outside the constitution, can we also set up
within such territory a tariff against the exports of the
United States? Â¦
WHEN we referred to, the issue that the Su
preme Court might have to meet, collateral
to. its island decision, respecting the effect
of an impost laid in Porto Rico upon, exports from
the United States we had overlooked the presence of
that very question in a case before the court. It
seems that a case is made embodying the principle
of the cotton tax decision, and a decision was ex
pected before the court took its vacation.

The Union is to-day stronger than ever before in
its history. Men of all sections are more thoroughly
united in sentiment and in loyalty than at any previous
time since first the flag was given to the breeze. The
republic has now advanced to the rank of the first
among the nations of the earth, and all of its people
recognize how much of their individual prosperity is
due to the unity which holds them together as citi
zens of so glorious a country. In that recognition
there will not fail to be a spirit of universal thankful
ness for the patriotism of the men who have preserved
the Union, from destruction and kep.t it for the bless
ing of all generations to come. So we meet the day
with salutation to, the living veterans and with flowers
and tears for those who are passed away after having
fought the good.fisht and kept the faith on land and
The veterans of the Grand Army as they march
with solemn step and slow to the decoration of the
graves of their comrades, as they recall with loving
hearts the memories of those who' have joined
the silent majority, and look with sad eyes
upon the lessening number of those who are still
alive, need not regret that in the multitude of. their
fellow citizens there are many who seem indifferent
to the sacredness of the day. The indifference is one
of seeming only. Deep in the heart of every American
patriot is a sense of honor and gratitude to the men
who fought the war that freed the slave and kept the
nation whole. Young America will not forget the
men of the generation of Lincoln and Grant any more
than it will forget these of the days of Washington
and Tefferson.
As the years pass the character of the celebration
of the day changes. That of course was to have been
expected. It began as a day of mourning for the loss
of the heroic dead, but now as the grief of the people
has weakened with the passage of time so has the
feeling of rejoicing over the restored Union increased.
Decoration day to a vast number of the American
people has become a day of gladness rather than of
sorrow. Many will observe it as a holiday of pleas
ure, and while in some respects it is to be regretted
that it is so, nevertheless it is not strange that a joy in
the living Union should survive the mourning for
the departed dead.
On this occasion it is probable that in many parts
of the Union a new and poetic ceremony will be
added to those to which we have been accustomed â
that in addition to the decoration of the graves of
those who rest in the soil of the republic there will
be strewn upon the waves of the sea offerings of
flowers in memory of those who fought for the
Union upon the ocean and who nov rest beneath its
waves. In that ceremony the memory of brave men
and stanch patriots will be commemorated who have
hitherto been neglected from the ceremonies though
not forgotten, and so the day will be more truly a
memorial festival than ever before.
ONCE more the nation engages in the solemn
ceremonies attending the decoration of the
graves of the men of the army and the navy
who during the strenuous years of the Civil War up
held the national banner and all the glorious hopes it
symbolizes. Once mere the Grand Army rallies its
rapidly thinning ranks to direct the ceremonies and
to take, as is proper, the chief part in them. To the
minds of the people is recalled _the greatness of the
sacrifices made by the veterans that the Union might
live, and once more feelings of gratitude and of honor
rill every patriotic heart.

PERSONAL MENTION.
That means of course the maintenance in Porto
Rico of a form of government similar to that which
the British, the French and the Danes practice in the
West Indies. It is doubtless the best that can be done
at present, but its adoption is not going to be any
great inducement to Americans to go to Porto Rico
and infuse energy into industry.
Commenting upon the government of the islands
the Governor says: "I feel as the result of a year's
close study on the spot of all conditions surrounding
this problem that Congress has gone quite as far as
it could safely venture in the form of government al
ready-existing on the island, and as the result of such
experience and observation I fully believe, with good
men devoted to the work, the : island will develop
faster under such form, and its people through expe
rience and education will advance' more rapidly in
their knowledge of civic virtues under present meth
ods than could be gained in any other way."
The people of Porto Rico do not eat bananas and
sweet potatoes rather, than corn beef -and cabbage
through any natural depravity or- idle epicurean taste,
In the struggle for existence in the tropics the vege
tarian has survived and the flesh-eater has perished.
Food is a matter of climate, and even so is work. Take
the best Anglo-Saxon stock that can be gathered in
the world, place them as colonists in a tropical land,
and either they will enslave the natives and live on the
labor of slaves, or else they will within two genera
tions become themselves addicted to bananas and
manana.
- The report will not surprise, the United States.
Despite all glowing words that have. been written of
the wealth of tropical countries, every intelligent man
knows they are not rich, nor can they be made rich
even by the infusion of Anglo-Saxon energy unless
means, be taken to send in a fresh supply of workers
about every two years, for it rarely takes more than
two tropical summers to convince even the white man
that under a burning sun it is a good deal wiser to
*eat bananas, work little and live than to eat- meat,
work hard and die.
GOVERNOR ALLEN of Porto Rico in his
first annual report to the State Department
has said in effect that the island would be a
valuable possession were it not for the inhabitants,
and the inhabitants would be good were it not for
bananas and sweet potatoes. From the summary of
the report that has been made public it appears the
Governor speaks quite plainly and says that in a
climate where a man can lie in a hammock, pick a
banana with one hand and dig : a sweet potato. with
one foot the incentive to idleness is too great to be
overcome by people who are willing to live on that
diet, and he urges the introduction of meat-eating
Anglo-Saxons with push and energy to break the
lethargy of the islanders and develop the natural
richne'ss of the country to its full measure. â¢ :

Before passing: any such resolution as the
one under discussion. I am of the opinion
that we ought to know, first of all. that
plague ever has existed and still exists in
San Francisco. Now. I for one cannot admit
the existence of the said disease without con
vincing- proof, and I challenge any one In tBU
hall to bring forth such proof if he can.
The two pioneers in the field of bacteria
logical work in relation to bubonic plagu*
found and described two widely dlfferen.
bacilli as the cause of said disease. I mean
Kltarato and Yersln. Ogata and Yamaglwa
later on controverted the claim of their coun
tryman Kitarato to the discovery of the
plague bacillus by demonstrating that nis
bacillus differed in various points from the
one discovered by Tersln. Yamaglwa only
found the Kltarato .bacillus- In the cadaver.
while specimens taken Iron? the living only
showed Yersin's bacillus, without any other
microbes, and he therefore thinks that Yer
sin's baciUus is the cause of bubonic plague.
Now from all the Information I have been
able to gather In regard to the methods of
examination practiced here at different times
and by different investigators, I have failed to
find one single case reported in which an ex
amination of the blood or tissues taken from
the living had been made with a view ot
establishing the existence of the disease, and
it is not surprising at all that only cadavera
were examined and experimented with for
the simple reason that living respectable cases
could nowhere be found. Now then. I ask.
when It Is Impossible to find patients af
flicted with the disease (which is known to bÂ«
of a highly virulent and infectious character)
in the very heart of that focus of all kind*
San Francisco which is called Chinatown,
the very heart of that "focus of all *ind3
of infectious material, where the most favor
able conditions prevail for the propagation and
multiplication of disease germs, where shall
we look for the plague in order to find it? la
4t not Justifiable, in consideration of these
facts, to claim that there Is not and never was
any plague in San Francisco and that wÂ«
should waste our time looking for It with a
lantern even in broad daylight, like Diogenea
looking for an honest man? __
I perfectly agree with Dr. Elllnwood and
want to place myself on record as opposing
any resolution with regard to plague before
we have proof that such a disease exists In
San Francisco or elsewhere in the State.

For a long time Russia has been a close competitor
of the United States in "the quantity of oil produced,
but as American oil is much superior to Russian and
yields nearly twice as much refined illuminating oil in
proportion to the crude oil, the value of our output
has been much greater than that of the competing
producer.^ The difference in our favor will be aug
mented by the recent discoveries in Texas and Cali
fornia, and consequently we shall continue to hold our
lead in the oil- markets of the world.

The list of dangerous and unhealthful
trades Is indeed a long and, to a sensitive
mind, a shocking one. Fllemakers, pot
ters, hatters, printers, stonecutters, glass
workers and smelters work under condi
tions wh:ch cut short their existence,
while yet they. render useful â in fact, in
dispensable â service to the- community.
Most of the conditions which make for
ill health in the industries named could
be, .as others have been, removed, but
commercial greed and human indifference
are the causes of continued existence of
factors detrimental to human progress
hardly yet recognized by otherwise.intel
ligent observers. Conditions, of factory
life aro not as bad in this country as they
are^abroad, buL even here they affect to
a considerable degree the health and lon
gevity of employes. â¢ Â¦ , .>
There is implied in this not only a great
social waste, but a direct and considerable
Iosp to the employer himself, in that em
ployes developed to a high degree of effi
ciency die just when their services are the
most useful. Thus, lead poisoning in the
potteries, phosphorous poisoning in match
works, mercurial poisoning in hat fac
tories and lung diseases in glass works
cause annually premature deaths of thou
sands of able workmen just when these
men have reached the age of 40 or 50 and
v.'hen a lesser degree of activity with more
intelligence would produce a sufficient In
come for a cheerful, period of advanced
age. Immense progress has been. made,
especially in this country, where factories
are new. 'end where money is liberally
spent for improvements tending to better
the conditions under - which workingmen
live, but'a vast field is yet unexplored and
unrecognized. Industrial hygiene is in its
infancy. The time will come when work
ingmen will use . their unions more for
their health, than for their Wages, . and
when strikes will take place because of
conditions which shorten life rather than
because of conditions which are of far
less importance. As -yet the a\'erage
workman has but faintly realized the im
mense possibilities of social amelioration
in the direction of a healthier and a longer
life. â¢Â¦ â¢
The End of One Who Despairs.
It is not apleasing task to digress from
this essay, upon long life into the mystery
of despair and self-inflicted death. "Life
is a conflict and a march." wrote Mazzini
many years ago, in strenuous opposition
to Carlyle's gospel of despair. "Not life
itself, but the deviation from life, is a
disease; life is sacred, life Is the, aspira
tion toward I the ideal. Â¦ It is blasphemy
to pronounce one I word Â¦ of- anger against
it." I add his words, "We must not d's
credit it, but make , It holy." Suicide;
contempt for life, must be included in the
deadly sins. > Those who have ; helped to
make the world a better place to live in
are ' the , men and women who have real-
In a recently published volume, "The
Map of Life," Mr. Lecky has laid down
a principle which I cannot but think in
dispensable as a guiding rule in every dis
cussion of old age and the value of in
creased longevity. "In all civilized coun
tries," Mr. Lecky writes, "the average
(duration) of life has been raised and
there is good reason to believe that not
only old age, but also active, useful, en
joyable old age, has become much more
frequent." 'A useful, enjoyable, active old
age, not mere continued existence, but
LIFE! â not a weary, monotonous drag of
days, but active, useful, cheerful hours,
a blessing 1 to the man who lives and to
those who live with him. "What I ad
mire in Ramsay," said Boswell to Dr.
Johnson, "is his continuing so young."
"Why, yes, sir," answered the old doctor;
"I value myself upon this, that there is
nothing of the old man in my conversa
tion." In a more pointed manner Hazlitt
reflected upon old age in his remark:
"Artists, I think, who have succeeded in
their chief objects live to be old and are
agreeable old men. Their minds keep
alive to the last. Cosway's spirit never
flagged till after 90, and Nollekins, though
nearly blind, passed, all his mornings in
giving directions about some group or
bust or in his workshop." Such, then, is
the ideal conception of old age; a cheerful,
useful existenceâ not a mere continued
life of useless years added to other years
which have wearily preceded it.
Industry lies at the bottom of social
progress, and happiness and long life in
variably go hand in hand with days well
spent in active employments. Proof is
not wanting to show that the man who
works has allotted to him a longer share
of life than the man who does not work,
an idle aristocrat or vagabond and tramp.
Occupied males, according to trustworthy
data, enjoy a mortality 132 per cent more
favorable than those who eat their bread
in idleness, and perhaps in no manner and
way has nature stamped the sin of idle
ness with more emphatic disapproval than
in the severe rule that he who does not
work for his bread shall not live long
enough to enjoy the fruit of the labors of
others.
Value of Temperance and . Morality.
With industry goes morality as a most,
perhaps the most, important factor mak
ing for continued and enjoyable exist
ence. Whether it be morality in general,
or as implied in anti-social trades, he
whose existence is adverse to social pro
gress is not likely to live long and ply his
trade. Married women with children, fol
lowing the business of motherhood and
home life, are among the most blessed in
years and hap'py hours. Liquor dealers
are short-lived, in fact, are among those
whose days are least, because their usual
habits of intemperance cause most havoc
to their constitutions. Temperance in
drinking is, as a rule, an essential re
quirement for long-continued life, though
some fond of "the golden^brown drink
that England has brewed for a thousand
Octobers" have lived to see the dawn of
another century, after a life which, in the
opinion of teetotalers, snould have been
cut short in youth. Intemperance in eat
ing is probably far more fatal to long life
than any other factor, since idleness and
immorality most often go with gluttony.
Overweight, in fact, is recognized by
medical examiners as one of the signs
most unfavorable to longevity, tending to
nervous, circulatory and kindred diseases.
Morality and industry, then, must be
accepted as essentials making for a long
existence. Jews and Quakers enjoy a long
life and old age which for cheerfulness
and usefulness has probably no equal.
Those Who Live Long.
Mere physical .labor, mere activity as
such, even if prolonged for many years
cannot be looked upon as being of intrin
sic social and economic- value. It was
Carlyle who touched upon the point with
his common emphasis in the remark:
"In the name of .production, be/brutes."
Merchants, traders, brokers and all who
make the accumulation of wealth their
primary object are less likely to live long
than those who relegate the pursuit of
wealth to the 'secondary place. The
years which a man lives after 60 are in
deed to be -considered the most import
ant, since the complacent retrospect of
active, useful years finds in this period
of afterglow its rich reward. A study
of sudden deaths of men of affairs will
point out lessons of the utmost signifi
cance, and we see men like William Win
dom, Henry George, Roswell P. Flower or
Garret A. Hobart pass away at a^time
when they had just-reached the period of
greatest usefulness. â¢ .
j Among those whese lives are longest we
may mention clergymen, gardeners, farm
ers, tr-achers,'. laborers on farms, artiste,
engravers, sculptors and architects. The
lives of eminent painters alone are a wor

Clergymen have lived long largely, no
doubt, because of useful, lives lived in
temperate ways and helped by a prudent
self-denial of things human which are
most apt to cut short the natural life of
man. There is much to be learned from
the vital statistics of occupations which
may be applied to a higher social philoso
phy.

An Analysis of the Chances Which Men and
Women Have of Living to Be One
Hundred Years Old.
By Frederick Hi. Hoffinan.

COPYRIGHT, 1901.
XV. INDUSTRY, MORALITY AND OLD AGE.
i ized that we are here to do our duty, in
spired by a deep and active feeling . of
duty, which once more in the. words of
Mazzini,- "he believes to be the mission
1 of man -upon earth." This duty includes
cheerfulness, patient forbearance, yet Joy
of living and existence. Vital feelings of
delight, not the soul-deadening cry , of de
spair and unwarranted CQmplaint.* Such
a life only is worth living" to the end of
100 years. If men .wish to live long they
must grow old gracefully and to the last
hour remain cheerful, for there la an im
mense economic gain In cheerfulness, just
as there is a political, or at least a social,
economy of courage and the spirit to
dare. Â¦ , â¢
Lot a man -but will to live and he can.
Will is largely a moral product and will
without activity, effort and aim is impos
sible. "Why even death itself stands
still and waits an hour sometimes, for
such a will." Ay, death will wait many a
year for the man who has lived aright
his years and who has an object worth
living .for.
Increasing- length, of Life.
I have not thought it worth while to
enter at length upon the question of the
possibility of long-continued existence.
It need not be pointed out that there is
no set limit to life, and there appear no
physiological reasons why life should
end, why the heart should cease to per
form its functions at the age of 70 any
more than at 120. ! Certainly the facts are
abundant tending to prove that authenti
cated old age is being attained by men
and women in this country with an in
creasing degree of frequency, and, what
is better, to Quote the words of E. P.
Powell, "It is certain that our American
men at 60 are not broken up as badly
as our fathers of 40." Immense gains
have been made in the direction of de
creasing the mortality of children, and
larger numbers reach the age of 30 and
40 than at any other period of our his
tory, but there are still at work deadly
foes to long life which continue to elude
the control of man. Typhoid fever, con
sumption and the various forms of lung
diseases cause premature death fn many
cases when life could have been pro
longed under improved conditions. But it
is to the diseases of middle life and of
the age period 55 and over, the affections
of the heart and nervous system, the va
rious forms of liver and urinary diseases,
and among women even more than
among men, the most dread disease of
cancer, ! that old age is far more rare
than It would be could- medical science
make the progress which surgery has
made and reach that point of exactitude
and controf of forces by which a disease
in its early stages can be successfully ar
rested. Unhappily, medical treatment Is
usually sought too late, at a time "when
the system has been too far broken down
by the encreachment of disease germs de
stroying vital tissue.
Improving Habits of Youth.
Thus far the gain has been mo3tly upon
the younger lives; it is in youch that wÂ«
form our habits, and I believe vhat our
young men, spite of all remarks to the
contrary, are to-day stronger, healthier,
more active and more ambitious than the
youth of any nation at any time In the
past. It is no longer fashionable to look
pale and delicate, with a tendency to con
sumption <Jc scrofula and anaemia. Â¦ -
John Burn Bailey called attention to the
fact which he had noted from his own in
quiries "that the mentally deficient or in
tellectually Inactive fail to be represented
in his list of the longlived; energy of brain
must coexist with vigor of body to insure
extreme longevity," and to this remark I
may add one of Hufeland's observations
on the art of T>rolonged life, that "no in
stance can be â¢ found of an idler having
attained to a remarkable old age."
Old Age That Is "Worth Having.
What I have tried to make clear in these
few remarks upon industry and long life Is
the necessary relation between continued
years and increasing , usefulness. Mere
continued years cannot be looked upon or
desired from an individual or social point
of view unless the increase of years brings
increase of happiness to the one who lives
beyond the normal age, and to those with
whom his existence is interwoven. "VÂ»'hy
stay we on earth unless wÂ© grow?"
Everything pertaining to the right view of
long life is to be found in these few words
of Browning, "unless we grow." Not a
standstill, not a retrogression, a second
childhood,, decrepit and dependent, but a
strong, persistent vitality continued to the
end. Without an intellectual life such ex
istence is impossible. It must prove a bore
to the man who lives and to those vho
have to live with him. No -one has ex
pressed this thought more beautifully than
Hamerton: "I compare the life of the in
tellectual"âand, as he has said elsewhere,
the intellectual life is possible to all who
earnestly desire it â "to a long wedge of
gold; the thin end of it begins at birth,
and the depth and value of Jt go on in
definitely, increasing until at last comes
Death, who stops the auriferous process.
Oh, the happiness of j the fortunate old
men whose thoughts went deeper and
deeper like a wall that runs out into the
sea." Such, then, is the old age, the long
life worth living, worth striving for,
worth fighting for. -
Chances of Living 10O Tears.
What, then, are thejehances of reaching
the age of 100 under present-day condi
tions? The. answer to this Question i3
somewhat difficult, since life tables are
based on the general population, for which
the returns at advanced ages are notably
in error, while data supplied by life in
surance companies are not applicable to
the people In general, including the un
healthy and otherwise impaired from an
insurance point of view. For Massachu
setts a recent life table has been prepared
by which it is possible to arrive at the
point desired with at least an approxi
mate degree of accuracy. Dr. S. W. Ab
bott has calculated on the returns for the
years 1893-18S7 that out of 10,000 bom in
that State nine persons may be expected
to reach, the century mark, and those
who attain this age may still expect to
live 1.2 years longer if males and l.o years
lcr.ger.if females. A comparative table
for the year 1855 ' shows that about half
a century ago very few indeed had .a
chance to reach the extreme age of 100,
since by a table prepared by Elliott only
nine out of 100,000 would survive to that
age. In other words,- the chance of at
taining the age of 100 in Massachusetts is
to-day ten times what it was naif a cen
tury ago. â¢ .
But in a large measure the attaining of
old age by the few is of far less impor
tance to the community than the attain
ing of middle age and years past middle
age by the many. Every death" between
the ages of 15 and 30 is a social calamity
and economic Joss, in that a life comes to
an end when most has been sunk in its
production and when least has been re
turned to the community in the shape of
productive labor and surplus gain. It Is,
then, a matter of importance to note that
there has been a material increase in the
number of those who survive to the ages
of 30, 40 and 50. although the gain has not
been as large as would be desirable and
as will be possible under better conditions
of city life. At present -in Massachusetts
there are expected to survive to the ajre
of 50 5275 persons out of every 10.000 born
against 4409 survivors out of the same
number In 1855. At the age of 80 the num
ber of survivors is 1266 at present, against
1059 half a century ago: and thus the most
valuable lives, valuable because â¢ of en
hanced intelligence and comprehension
have been saved to the state because of
the sanitary end -other social progress
made during the last fifty years. Â° 5ress
As that paper\has been upon all sides of the issue
dealt with by the court, it can make its claim with
some show of reason. But, as in jurisprudence, even
of the yellow journalistic variety, the last decision
stands as the law of the case until reversed, one may
go to the Examiner's latest judgment in order to
compare it with the decision of- the court. Within
ten days the Examiner's latest judgment was de
clared. Under the caption, "Aguinaldo Converted,"
that paper said: "Even Aguinaldo has at last been
driven by the compulsion of facts and common sense
to accept the view which the Examiner has steadily
maintained ever since the Philippine question forced
itself upon the American people. A dispatch from
Manila announces that in an interview with a cor
respondent of the Associated Press the caged leader
of the insurrection expressed the opinion 'that the
American government of the Philippines, in order to
be satisfactory, should conform strictly to the con
stitution.' This has been the Examiner's position
from the beginning. We have never wavered in the
belief that both Congress and the insurgent command
ers would in time recognize the justice and wisdom
of a territorial government for the Philippine people,
under the broad guarantees and careful limitations of
the constitution."
And now the Examiner says its opinion is affirmed!
But the court says, in terms, that the power of Con
gress over the Philippines is "outside the constitu
tion," and is expected to be exercised as justly and
carefully as the powers of that body within the con
stitution. That is to say, the new power ? of Congress
discovered by the court is not subject to "the broad
guarantees and careful limitations of the constitu
tion," unless Congress choose to accept them as its
guide. ' The power, therefore, is plenary in Congress,
in the sense of being full, original with that body,
underived, and without limitation, and not subject to
constitutional review or restraint. That this is so is
plain in the argument made by the court, in these
terms: "It is safe to say that if Congress should ven
ture upon legislation manifestly dictated by selfish
interests it would receive quick rebuke at the hands of
the people." If that have any meaning it is that the
islands must rely for fair and unselfish legislation not
upon the broad guarantees and careful limitations of
the constitution, but upon the justice and. mercy of
the American people, who can reverse oppressive
legislation by retiring the Congress that indulges in
it. Within the pale covered" by the constitution the
resort of the oppressed is to the courts. Without that
pale it is to the people.
Again, the decision flatly admits that there is no
provision in the constitution for such acquisition of
territory as we have made in the case of Porto Rico
and the Philippines, and therefore no provision ex
ists for its government. Hence the right of ac
quisition and government is outside the constitution,
and the court derives it from the general nature of
sovereignty. So the court says: "If it be once con
ceded we are at liberty to acquire foreign territory a
presumption arises that our power with respect to
such territory is the same power which other nations
have been, accustomed to exercise with respect to ter
ritory 'acquired by them. If, in limiting the power
which Congress was to exercise within the United
States, it was also intended to limit it with regard to
such territories as the United States should thereafter
acquire, such limitations should have been expressed."
What other nations does the court mean when it
seeks for the powers which Congress may exercise as
it says "outside the constitution"? -They are of course
the nations that have been acquisitive of territory.
They are England, Russia, Germany, France, Hol
land and the others which have by conquest sought
additions to their landed empire. If the Examiner
can prove that they have bestowed upon these acqui
sitions the broad guarantees, and have in their gov
ernment been restrained by the careful limitations of
the American constitution, it may be able to connect
its views with the court's decision.
Perhaps, however, it relies upon its ability to fool
most of its readers all of the time.
The Examiner is of opinion that it has been af
firmed, and quotes itself as a court of first instance.
THE Supreme Court, if it read the volume of
newspaper opinions upon ' its decision, in the
island cases, will be apt to feel undecided as to
the meaning of its own decision. ;

THE FOUR-MASTED BRITISH BARK ARRACAN, NOW OVERDUE ,AT THIS PORT FROM AUSTRALIA. SHE IS
A SISTER SHIP TO THE WELL-KNOWN AFGHANISTAN AND IS DEEMED A CLIPPER. SHE IS LADEN
WITH COAL. .
The advent of the new steamships Ko
rean and Siberian, now nearing comple
tion at Newport News for the Pacific
Mail Company, will make some radical
changes In shipping circles. According
to one of the best posted men on the front
the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company will go out of existence and the
Gaelic, Coptic and Doric will be returned
to their British owners, as the Mall Com
pany will be able to handle the trade
alone. The Santa Fe wants vessels of
this class for the China trade, and Ismar,
Imrie & Co. may be able to dispose of the
fleet to the railroad.
The Toyo Kisen Kaisha will build three
larger and faster vessels to supersede the
America Maru, Nippon Maru and Hong
kong Maru and will continue running' in
conjunction with the Mail Company,
while the White Star line (Ismay, Imrie
& Co.) may put the Majestic, Teutonic
and Gothic on the route; that Is, if the
Santa Fe takes the Gaelic, Coptic and
Doric.
Some months ago the Occidental and
Oriental Company wanted to replace the
Gaelic. Coptic and Doric with larger ves
sels, and as the Oceanic and Celtic, the
two largest steamships afloat, have re
cently been added to the White Star's
Atlantic fleet, and others are building,
that concern was willing to send out three
vessels that can average eighteen knots
an hour to replace the three now on the
route. The powers that be in New York
would not agree to the arrangements,
however, as the programme for the O. and
O. will be merged into the Pacific Mail.
In that event the Santa Fe and White
Star people will be looking for wharf
space.
The Korean and Siberian, the Mall Com
pany's new steamships, will each carry
between 15,000 and 17,000 tons of freight,
or do as much as half a dozen of the
present fleet can, besides having magnifi
cent passenger accommodation. The China
will continue on her present run, while
the Mail Company may put some of its
Panama fleet on the Hongkong-Manila
route to act as feeders to the China fleet.
Everything is in the air just now, but
with the arriva! of the Korean the Mail
Company's employes expect to see many
startling changes.
Another competitor of the Pacific Mail
that is building larger steamships for its
trade Is the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company. It has recently, in conjunction
with the Compania Sud Americana de
Vapores, entered into competition with
the American company, and it looks as if
the new line had come to stay.
The Pacific Steam Navigation Company,
like the White Star line, is an English
concern, and it is having four new steam
ships built on the Clyde for its California
trade. The vessels are to be of 5000 tons
burden, 400 feet long, 52 feet beam and 29
feet deep. They are to be called Victoria,
California. Mexico and Panama. Judg
ing from the names, it would appear that
the company contemplates extending its
service to Victoria, B. C. The new boats
are being built as quickly as possible and
will be the most palatial steamships ever
seen on this coast.
What with the new vessels for the Pa
cific Mail, ocean greyhounds for the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha. twenty-knot fliers for the
White Star line, and the palatial liners
for the Pacific Steam Navigation Com
pany, not forgetting the magnificent new
vessels of the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany's fleet, times should be :busy along:
the front in a few months.
The Pacific Steam Navigation
Company in the Race for
Business.
May Absorb Occidental
and Oriental Line of
Steamships.

ANALYSIS OF LLOOD AND URINE.
This Is the only tosltlve and scientific
method of knowlnz whether a KIDNEY

produces in some wntal or nervous symp-

while in others the URIC ACID la pre-

The sales since January 1 amount to. 91,127,900
against 01, 466,900 pounds for the corresponding
time last year. " â¢'.
Sales for the week In Boston amounted to
2.135,000 pounds domestic and 155,000 pounds for
eign, making a total of 2,290.000 pounds, against
a total of 1,150,000 pounds for the corresponding
period last year.
BOSTON, May 29.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
There Is as yet I no Increase to be noted In
the amount of business^ in proKress in the wool
market. In fact, the Market has ruled quieter
the past week than during tho previous week,
and we figure the sales at only 2,290,000 pounds,
against 3.627.0CO pounds a week ago. Some of
the large mills are reported in the market, but
with only one exception, they have taken very
small quantities of wool. The trend of the
goods market Is . apparently toward an . im
provement, but the clothing trade is still buy-
Ins; goods in a conservative way. which Is re
flected In a very quiet demand for wool. Prices
continue in favor of the buyer except on fine
wools, which are pretty fairly held in view
of the strength shown in the country and the
relati\'e firmness of fine stock at the London
eales. The excitement in the West has abated.
Two of the largest dealers in the market have
bought no wools in the 'West, believing that
the prices which have been paid there are not
warranted. Not over 25,000,000 pounds of new
wools thus far thin year have been bought
out there, and conservative dealers are of the
opinion that new wools can be bought at more
favorable terms later on â at any rate, they are
willing to take their chances of securing their
wools later at as favorable terms as are now
quoted. Â¦ . â¢ .

I'ik wan Â»-..)Â»K on In mocks which havÂ« rÂ«
Â«*ntly advam-fd under cover ft the new point!
Ol Ktrrnkth. Thus, whllo Atchisen, Penniyl

â¢|..l.m-rn nm I.k. Kim knunnnH. Wutmnii rinckn,
Mrle Â«n<1 Amr-rlran Car were held back, al'
thiugh much \rt* urtlve than during the time
nf their receju advance. The rtrength shown
durihK thi> day seemed Â»o lie largely due to
â¢Â¦perlul raUfter. but tile* favorable prORrers made
i n the London st.K-k I-JxcliniiKe settlement and
the liope that It* completion will clear thÂ« way
jnr a growth of confidence was a favorable
Tactnr. Homethlng was made of the absence
of Northern Pacific etock from the list of col
lateral for the new Union Pacific convertible
tx>na>, as indicating a prospect of a settle
ment of the Northern Pacific dispute. This
bund issue is supposed to provide means to
l>ay for the Northern Paclflc stocks bought
tit- wfli as for the Southern Pacific, which Is
Included In the collateral. A clause In the
mortgage leaves the power unimpaired to use
the proceeds of the mortgage tor the North
ern Pacific purchases. Union Pacific stock
rhnu!d not move decisively, although It re
cnv#-rrd wll from a period of weakness, not
brlding the entire recovery. April net earn
ings were an element In the strength of a num
ber of railroad stocks and were supplemented
r>y othr-r explanation*, possibly to further a
emulative movement. Atchlson's statement
published previously was a continuing lnfluenpe.
The advance in Pennsylvania was made to ap
ix-ar in t-ynijÂ«ithy with a revival of the old
r>imorK ot a union in retaliation for the project
r.f % \Vaba*h crunk line outlet. The halt in the
upward movement of Wabash and Lackawanna
may have been significant in the. tame con
r.ertion. Southern Pacific presented a very
Ftrong statement of net earnings and Southern
Hallway. Union Pacific and St. Louis and San
7'rancisco also made pood showing for April.
Reports were current that Union Pacific wab
rstending its holdings of Southern Pacific so
as to secure absolute control. Pacific Mail's
r>e was in sympathy with Southern Pacific.
The rise in Denver and Rio Grande was unex
plained. The unfavorable features of the Gov
ernment's weekly crop report and the unex
l*-ote<lly larRe gold exports were ignored. Gold
engagements ran up at cne time to $1,165,000.
They were later reduced to $3,500,000 to comply
wiih insurance requirements. The present
movement of rold may very probably be in
liquidation of obligations incurred a few weeks
ego.

CHICAGO. May 29.â The higher cables from
Liverpool, which market had been closed for
a holiday since Friday, were supplemented by
reports â¢ of continued dry weather In West,
Southwest and Northwest, and these condi
tions, coupled with rumored damage by fly,
stimulated a strong demand at tho opening.
The initial price of the July delivery of wheat
was a shade to Vic higher at 74Q7 1'ic. Un
der the execution of numerous outside orders
the market advanced steadily to 7-Â»V4c. A good
part . of the trading was said to be for the
export account. Reports of heavy rains In
the Dakotas caused a decline ...to 73%c. , Some
fof-mer sellers then became buyers and a rally
to 73%@74c followed, but this was only the
forerunner of another decline resulting from
a desire on the part of tho various -traders
to even up for over to-morrow's holiday. ThÂ«
close was heavy, >ic lower at 73 : !4@T3%c.
The corn market was firm and moderately
active. July opened higher on improved ca
bles and light receipts, but recovered under a
good demand by professionals. The close was
firm, %c higher at 44%c.
The oats market was steady, though trade
was not so active as yesterday. July closed
unchanged at -Mstfi "S%c.
Provisions were firm in sympathy with high
er hogs. Trade was moderate. July pork and
lard closed 5c higher and ribs unchanged.
The trading futures ranged us follows:

Stafford conducts an extensive coal yard

young man, who started .tp .follow .him.
Stafford boarded a car and the unknown,

on to the car. On arriving at the club
Stafford remained .about half an hour,
and on emerging his unknown shadow
was there waiting for him. Day after day
Stafford was followed by this mysterious

Yesterday morning Stafford left his
house, about 8 o'clock to go to business,
and there was his shadow ready to escort
him to the oftlce. Stafford looked up and
down his residence block on Broderiek
street, and seeing that no one was arounp
he addressed tho sleuth.
"Why. do you follow me all tho time?
asked Stafford. "What is your motive?"
Tho man refused to explain his actions.
Stafford decided that there .was no time
like the present to settle tho matter. He
landed a vicious right on the Jaw of his
reticent and mysterious shadow and fol
lowed it up with other punches. When
Stafford had completed the work the
shadow's face Â¦ was blacker than that of
any of the workmen employed in the coal
yard The man took to tho tall and uncut
timbers and has not been seen since by
"I have been doing some investigating

At headquarters to-day it was an

General Lome-Campbell, the British

I j is once again in this city, having
i ~* arrived here last Sunday night
. I -^ direct from New York City to
rest for a few weeks.*
Miss Butler has only been on the stage
a few years, but her talent has won for
her an enviable position in her profession.
She made her first public appearance in
this city at a benefit given by the Press
Club and scored an instantaneous hit. Her
subsequent tour of the vaudeville circuit
caused the young actress to receive flat
tering offers from leading Eastern man
agers. In vaudeville Miss Butler gave a
number of impersonations of well known
actresses and everywhere she was the re
cipient of laudatory criticism.
On April 17 of this year Miss Butler ap
peared at the Herald Square Theater in
New York City in "The Prima Donna,"
written by Harry B. Smith and Aime
Lachaume. Although the company was
composed of Gotham favorites, Miss But
ler captured the honors of the comic
opera and the critics devoted considerable
space to reviewing the performance. The
young actress, who is the daughter of
John Butler, the well known boniface of
this city, will appear in New York this
year in an opera now being written for
her by Harry B. Smith of "Robin Hood"
fame. . Â¦

The" rich red melodrama, "The War of
Wealth," is stirring the hearts of : the
patrons of the Central Theater this week.
"Old Glory," another of the kind, will
follow. "Old Glory" is a story of the
American bluejackets In Chile and is
strengthened by a realistic naval encoun
ter between the cruiser Baltimore and a
Chilean privateer.
The double bill at the Alcazar, "The
First Born" and "Gloriana." will come to
an end . of Its successful run this week,
and Florence Roberts will then begin her
usual summer reason with "Bonnie Prince

"The Toy Maker" at the Tivoli seems to
have a new lease of life, for the business
this week has been bigsrer than ever. The
piece goes with wonderful snap, and every
one In the cast keeps well up to the- mark
of excellence. Annie Myers, Hartman,
Cunningham, Webb and the rest of the
people in the play have made good. An
extra matinee will be given Thursday
afternoon, Decoration day, and another
toy souvenir matinee will be given on
Saturday. "The Babes in the Woods" will
follow at some undetermined date.
This afternoon there will be a "bargain
matinee" at the California Theater, with
"Phroso" on the counter." Anthony
Hope's latest melodrama has not found
sucn strong favor with its audiences as
its author's famous "Prisoner of Zenda,"
but what is good in itâ and there are
strong spotsâ is amply well taken care of
by James Neill and his capable company.
"A Colonial Girl" will follow "Phroso."
This is a beautiful drama of the revolu
tion. The sale of seats opens this morn

CLEVER CALIFORNIA ACTRESS
WHO WON LAURELS FOR HER
SELF IN THE EAST/
Iii the report of the board of directors
of the Merchants' Association of San
Franciscoj rendered at the seventh an
nual meeting held in the Academy of
Sciences building last night, it was shown
that through the efforts of the merchants
much that was for the welfare of this
city had been accomplished.
The meeting was an enthusiastic one
and as such a fitting close to the seventh
year of F. W. Dohrmann's service as pres
ident of the association. Mr. Dohrmann,
who retired from office last night, was
presented with a handsomely engrossed
set of ' resolutions, signed by more than
1200 merchants of this city, as a tribute
to his efforts during his/long term of of
fice.
The following named business men were
elected directors of the association to
serve for the ensuing year:.
O. D. Baldwin, C. S. Benedict, Charles
Bundschu. Foster P. Cole, Andrew M. Davis,
W. ,T. Dutton, M. Oreenehaum, Marshal Hal*,
I A. .1. McNIcoll. W. 'J. Newman, Kdword H.
Pond. \V. T\ IJorllngton. Vrank J. Symmes,
A. H, Vail and F. II. ; Wheelan.
The constitution of the association was
amended to pi q vide for the selection of
the directors an follow 1 *:
Fifteen directors elected In the year 1902 shall
ro classify themselves by lot that five of them
shall respectively go out of office at the ex
piration of one. two, and three years. There
after five directors nhall be elected each year to
hold office for three years.
The Annual Report.
The annual report of the board of di
rectors was then read and showed that
during the year fifty regular meetings of
the association had been held. At each
meeting matters of great moment were
discussed and plans laid for the better
ment of conditions existing in San Fran
cisco, which as opportunity offered were
carried out. Hearty co-operation on the
part of the 1293 firms comprising the
membership of the organization resulted
in the making of many needed reforms.
The report refers to the successful ef
forts of the merchants to secure the es
tablishment of the Pacific Commercial
Museum, and ' to the benefits expected
therefrom:
The recent adoption by the Board of Super
visors of improved specifications, admitting
asphalt and other desirable paving materials,
marks a notable advance in* the paving of our
public streets is the result of organized effort
on the part ot the merchants. . The plan of
the Merchants' Association . to expend $125, COO
each year for a period of four years in the
repavement of accepted streets, has been rec
ommended by the Board of Public "Works to
the Supervisors for incorporation in the annual,
budget.
Possessions in Far East.
Uncle Sam's possessions in the far East
and this city's importance in connection
with them received consideration, as the
following extracts from the report show:
Strong resolutions have been forwarded to
the" California delegation in Congress calling
attention to the importance and necessity of 'Â¦
a direct ocean cable that will connect San
Francisco with our recently acquired posses
sions in the Pacific and paints in the Orient.
All the members, of the California delegation
in Congress have promised their support to the
early construction of such a cable. Recogniz
ing the benefits that would accrue from a
direct steamship line from this port to Manila,
the committee on trada and finance gave this
subject its earnest consideration. Conferences
were held with other commercial organizations
and a Â¦ delegation was : sent to Washington.
Favorable results are 'expected from thesÂ« ef
forts, iv.'.^r â " .'â¢Â¦ . : "..."'" '"' -
At the close of the reading of the report
Charles Bundschu ptesented the following
resolutions, which . were , unanimously
â¢adopted:
Resolved, That the Merchants' Association
hereby expresses its profound appreciation of
the valuable services rendered in behalf of the
association by - the five retiring members of
the board of directors. .â¢ . >
Resolved, That their constant devotion to the
best interests of the association and to the
welfare of the city merits the highest recogni
tion of every member of the Merchants' As
sociation and every patriotic citizen in San
Francisco. ' ' â¢ . ' Â«
Resolved, That these resolutions be presented
to each of the retiring directors and be spread
upon the minutes of the Merchants" Associa
tion.
President Is Complimented.
The following resolutions were then pre
sented and adopted unanimously, the
members rising and voting:
Wherea*, After Â»sven consecutive years of
faithful servico our worthy president, V. W.
Dohrmann, now retire* from the honorable
poHltlon that he has bo efficiently filled, there

The resolutions worn llncly engrossed,
forminjr a volume Â«tr.vernl incheÂ« thick,
suitably bound. ThÂ« book was enclosed in
a polished mahogany ease.
In accepting the tribute to hlÂ» worth Mr.
Dohrmann thanked his associates and
said he felt he was more than requited for
any effort ho had made In their behalf.
He Kpoke of the support ho had received
from his business associates and of the
deep interest he would always feel in the
efforts of his successor.
In his speech as retiring president M/.
Dohrmann said: . â¢ - '
' I need not refer In detail to the greatly
needed improvements which our city most re
quires, such as a modern sewer and drainage
system, new school and hospital buildings,
the imprcvement of our street, pavement* and
the placing of wires, which disfigure our thor
oughfares, under. ground, as these matters have
had the active and partly successful support
of our association, and are either "provided for
or will soon be before tho people in the shape
of bond elections, this time we hope to be
carried to a successful issue.
Neither do I need to repeat at length that
manufacturing enterprises should be encour
aged, the more so since the extensive develop
ment of oil as a cheap fuel will make It easier
hereafter, to establish and" maintain thru. *
. j Condemns Partisan Politics.
To the most casual observer It must be ap
parent I that partisan politics has no place in
city affairs. . City government Is business, not
politico. In the creation and adoption of the
present . charter of San .Francisco, it" was in
tended and expected that, by having municipal
election* entirely separate from State or na
tional- elections, questions relating to partisan
politics would be wholly removed. It should
be the constant aim of the Merchants' Asso
ciation to bring about this . desirable result.
I^ct us eliminate from local elections all'ref
erence to Federal issues, and confine our at
tention to tho erjually momentous matters of
strtcfly municipal concern.
It has always been a fundamental principle
of our organization. to co-operate with instead
of merely. criticizing municipal and State legig

There are smelters in this State that
can be made more economical to operate
also, according to Mr. Fennell. by the use
of Hcuid air in the place of coke. By in
troducing liquid air into the furnace one
half of the charge can be saved, which
would mean great things for the huge
plants operated in Shasta County in con
nection with the copper mining industry.
I.iould air wi!l also, he Bays, be used to
spray crude petroleum used for fuel in
stead of steam. Premising that under
such use of liquid air the crude fuel oil
could be made to yield 900 more caloric
heat units than under steam, it would re
sult in making one barrel of oil do the
work that three and a half barrels are
now doing, thereby decreasing the cost of
manufacturing.
Ocraid If. PcddcII. reprenenUn* thft
Tripler Ufjuld Air Company, now in thin
Â«-lt;\ Kays that there are various* ways in
which Uijulrl air will be employed to nerve
the pfculiar need* of California. The most
important perhaps Im in connection with
thÂ«Â» refriKf-ratlon of fruit* on transconti
nental train* moving from California to
thÂ« Atlantic coa*t. According to Mr. Fen
nell. 1500 earn will be constructed to run
"n the fianta Ke line* to carry the fruit
raft bound, and he figures out that the
erst of refrlceration per car will not ex
rrcd 120 for the overland Journey. He
nl*o *ayÂ« that mining operations in Cali
lornia will be made much more economi
cal, for it will be poaslble to operate drills
at a fraction of the cost of electricity.
Then again the liquid air, combined with
hydro-carbon, makes a strong explosive
that is much cheaper than nltroglycerin
rir other explosives now in common use
In minps. In Cripple Creek and in the
Butte (Mont.) mining districts alone, he
says, the savins in explosives could be 75
l>er cent, or $9.000,(KX). by using liquid air.
and the same proportionate saving could
be made in mining operations on the
Mother Lode and elsewhere in California.

Tl.e rdminir-trative council of the Na
liuiial Metal Trades Association takes the
prcund that the agreement had been vio
lated by the International Association of
Machinists, which organization, it is de
clared, has refused arbitration and has in
stituted strikes in many shops of the mem
bers of the National Metal Trades Asso
ciation.
TORONTO. Ont.. May 29.â "Reports from
EU parts of the United States are favor
ableâthose from the Pacific Coast better
than I expected." sajd President O'Conneil
of the International Association to-day.
""Already 130 firms 1:1 New York city have
granted the men's demands and the re
mainder, it is expected, will fall into line
soon.','
President O'Conneil denies a report that
he has power to order out railway ma
chinists. Only by the request of a three
fourths majority of all the men can a
strike be ordered. Referring to a tele
graphic dispatch of this morning, he said
he had already najned a committee of
three to meet the National Metal Trades
To-morrow. "But." he added, "any set
tlement by local representatives must be
along national lines."
KXOXVILLE, Tenn.. May 29.â All but
six machinists employed by the South
ern Railway at this place went out on
strike to-day. A report from Salisbury.
N. C, says that all the fifty machinists
went out to-day also. The local union
wired from Washington that the
mission of the machinists to Vice
President Gannon of the Southern Rail
way had proved futile. A message from
President O'Conneil was received, order
ing the strike. The chief demands of the
machinists are for nine hours and an in
crease of 12\t> per cent in wages. The
strikers claim that 95 per cent of the ma
chinists on the system of the Southern
Railway will be out to-morrow morning.
CHICAGO. May 29.-After arbitration
had failed to settle the differences be
tween Chicago union machinists and their
employers, the long-threatened general
strike in the machine trade of Chicago
and was ordered to-night by the
local committee of the machinists' union.
The break-down of the attempts *t arbi
tration came after a five hours' session
between the Joint arbitration board of tho
union and the Manufacturers' Associa
tion.
The issue up for arbitration was the
question of fixing a wage scale per hour
for the new nine hour day inaugurated
May 20. In place of the ten hour aay then
abrogated. Efforts at effecting a com
promise were made by both sides, but
to no purpose, and the strike order lol
lnwed. The walk-out will affect 7000 men.
The administrative council of tho Na
tional Metal Trades Association at a
mating here to-night declared its agree
ment with tho International Association
of Machinists for the machinery manu
facturing: plants of the entire country null
snd void and no longer binding: on the
National Metal Trades Association. The
aerpement. which 1* smashed, was a.lopt
t<\ at New York May 18. 1900, and at the
time was looked upon as tha best ever
drawn un between employers and work
mfn in its provisions for the avoidancfi of
strikes and lock-outs. The manufactur
er? lake the stand that they are not now
bound bv any aereement.
The hicliest increase of wages offered
bv the manufacturers during the machin
ists' council of arbitration was 5 per cent.
The work of the council was declared
over when the? manufacturers refused to
ii<-oede to an ultimatum of 10 per cent in
< rease demanded by the machinists. In
i!ie course of the session there were sev
Â«r.V deadlock? and at no time did a pet-
Element seem likely. In a near room was
h meetinp of the administrative council I
â¢â¢f the National Metal Trades Association I
â¢svfth over seventy members present from I
all parts of the country. They kept in â¢
dose touch with the arbitration proceed- ,

positively that he had not. 1 He said he

All day the morgue has been visited by
large crowds, but the first person is yet
to come 'who Is able, to recognize . the re
mains. "Lopez was noticed about 'the
streets on Tuesday. - . , , %.
. When taken Into custody by the Consta
ble Lopez presented every appearance of
dejection, and: the few words, uttered
by him were in relation to having at last
been apprehended ' and t the fear - that I he
would be compelled to answer for the aw
ful erime of murder. -'-Â¦Â¦ .
The handkerchief was subsequently ex
amined, and when it was discovered to be
fairly saturated with blood the officers
began to recall the remark made by the
prisoner upon being locked ilp. Â¦ Not; a
word or sound emanated from Lopez's
cell during the night, and when. the door
was opened at .1 o'clock yesterday morn
ing his lifeless body was found hanging
by a common -hay rope "fastened" to a
grating only five feet from the floor. As
Lopez was a six-footer, he was compelled
to bend , his knees and . submit to slow
strangulation., .Â¦Â¦â¢- The ": piece -of - rope 1 had
served him as a belt. v ---'-. . -Â¦
run down and would be called upon to an
swer for the murder of . the Hislop | boy.
Among the effects found upon him were a
handkerchief and the _ front page of one
of the Sunday morning papers containing
the story of the murder of the boy.
The inquest has furnished another lead
for the detectives to work upon. Â¦ -Mns,
Houston in her testimony told of a: man
with a white hat. who passed her and her
companion the nleht of the murder and
jOfet before it Is supposed to have taken
place, as she was going to call on some
people living at 26 Octavia street, which
lsyust around the corner from In? Hislcp
residence. The man with the white hat
ngssed her and went to- the door of No.
2#* where he tried to igaln-an-en
trance, but did not ring the bell. 'She saw
him working at the door, but as she
passed him end went- into No. 26.: .lie
â¢w*s still seeking Â¦.<Â¦ an . entrance to 24.
Captain Seymour will- investigate. Smith,
Â¦wjio was In attendance at the inauest, -had
â¢wath him a white hat. and he was asked
tQ put it onand stand up for-Mrs. Hous
ton to see- if he resembled, the man-*he
had seen.' but she would not say even, that
he resembled' the man who' passed her. ;
' There Is a new story in. the case, which
cpmes up from Redwood City, whcis a
man whose actions denote insanity, de
clared he was being pursued: by the police
for the murder of Robbie" HIsIod. and
then committed suicide.. The correspond
ents say he had a handkerchief, that bears
unmistakable sisrns cf blood. Sheriff Mans
field of San Mateo County reports to
Captain Seymour that there are no blood
stains on the handkerchief.- and neither
correspondents nor Sheriff can find out
from where the man came.
>Â¦ This : brought \ Lukher'athYriglit i into 'the

Charles Eichorn, who worked in the saus

that; after, taking a few drinks In Sheehy's

CLIMB A FIRE ESCAPE
TO ROB AN EflPTY SAFE
Captain Seymour and his men are In
vestigating a mysterious- safe robbery,
which occurred Monday morning In the
office of the Oakland Iron. Works Com
pany at 330 Market street The office â¢ is
situated on the sixth floor of the building.
After entering the place the burglars pro
ceeded to blow open the safe, " but before
they had bored holes in it they discovered
to -their great surprise that It was un
locked. After opening the | door of the
iron box the.- "gophers" forced the inner
drawer with a "jimmy." To their as
tonishment they found It empty.
The supposition Is that the burglais
gained an entrance to the office by climb
ing the flre escape on the Battery street
side of the building. The window of the
office had been left open and it is sup
posed that the men climbed through it
after reaching the top of the fire escape.
A citizen who was passing at -the. time
sawv the two men walk < down the fire
escape but thinking | that they were
line repairers he paid little attention to
them. Mr. Morgan, the president of the
company, is satisfied that â¢ the burglars
are experienced crooks. Â¦
"If they had told me of their coming, he
remarked yesterday, "I would have left
50 cents in the safe to recompense them
for their trouble.. However, I am- glad
that they discovered that the safe was
unlocked, otherwise I presume they would
have blown It open." . - Â¦ -

IS. Samuels, the druggist on the corner of
Ninth and Howard, where Smith and Luk
herath- went after leaving Sheehy's sa
loon, said the two men left his place not
later than twenty minutes past 8. Mrs.
Jane. Wiggins, landlady of the house in
which the two men lived, testified to hear
ing men talking in their room at what
she- afterward learned to be about half
past 9 or 10 o'clock. Mrs. Esther Houston
gave some immaterial testimony about
two men she had seen hanging around the
vicinity of Haight and Octavia streets on
Saturday night, Â¦ and Miss Viola Gagle,
who lives in the flat under that of the
Hislops, told how she heard a man leave
the Hislop house not later than a quarter

most important witnesses of the day,
Harry Smith and Herman Lukherath.
Smith's Testimony.
Smith's statement was that he met Luk-
Cisco, came to hik death at said 104% Haight

During the inquest the suspect was rep
resented by General W. H. L. Barne3,
who at the request of Henry Lund, the
Norwegian Consul, who was also present,
looked after the legal rights of the man
under detention. General Barnes - ex
plained at the .beginning of the Â¦ hearing
that he did not wish to interfere in the
proceedings, nor would he do so, but he
Â¦was there merely to see that the suspect
