GERMANS SAY THERE
IS MUCH TO BE DONE
N[TJCHWANG, Aug. 11 (via Shanghai, Aug. 17).â Two
thousand Chinese attacked the Russian intrenchments
here to-day. They were repulsed with heavy loss. Rus
sian atrocities in Niuchwang have excited the Chinese. It was
reported that 15,000 Chinese were coming here determined to
recapture the Chinese city at any cost, and the Russians have
sent a torpedo-boat to Port Arthur for reinforcements.

Nothing has come directly to the War Department from
General Chaffee, but the adjutant general's office is momentarily
expecting advices. The officials were on hand during the even
ing and waited until a late hour before leaving for home with
out receiving any dispatches.
As soon as he heard of the news Secretary Root came in
from the Country Club and remained for some time with the
President discussing the latest information which had come to
hand.
The President was overjoyed on hearing the news of the
safety of Minister Conger and his associates. He has been hope
ful all along that their rescue from the perilous position in
which they have been for so long a time would be successfully
accomplished. To-night's news confirms that hope.
Contrary to the press reports of to-day, Consul Fowler's
dispatch shows that the attack on the city met with strong re
sistance. The Japanese force engaged with the advance, ac
cording to the understanding of the officials here, numbered
10,000, so that the loss suffered by them was over 1 per cent.
Allowance is made for losses in the forces of the other armies,
but it is presumed that it was in proportion to that of the Jap
anese.
These facts evidently were communicated to General Chaf
fee and the other commanding generals of the allies. Realizing
these obstacles, it appears that the allies decided to attack the
city by the east gate. There are four gates to the city on the
east, two leading to the Chinese city and two to the Tartar city.
Just which one of these was selected as the attacking point Con
sul Fowlers dispatch does not disclose.
The officials here were aware of the fact that the strong
hold of the Boxers was in the Chinese city, and for the allies to
attempt to force their way through into the Tartar city, in
which the legation compounds are located, might mean a great
loss of life and possibly a defeat. It was also known that the
imperial troops, who have sided with the Boxers; 1 were, "many of
them, in or near the Chinese city, and that much of the artillery
and rifle fire which has been poured into the legations had been
from the walls separating the two cities.
Previous information which has been received here showed
that the allies' armies took possession of Tungchau on the 12th
inst. From that city to Peking the distance is not very great â Â¦
not more than a dozen miles. It seems evident, therefore, that
the armies halted for a time at Tungchau, probably for the pur
pose of giving the men a rest and preparing for the attack upon
the capital city in force after waiting until the rear of the advanc
ing hosts should arrive at the front. Possibly, also, the de
lay was the result of negotiations begun by the Chinese offi
cials looking to the deliver}- of the Ministers with a Chinese or
other escort. If negotiations were attempted they must have
failed, as the army continued on its march and attacked the
capital three days after reaching Tungchau.
giving important details of the occurrences at the time of the
capture of the city, was given out later in an official statement.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. â The allied armies have cap
tured and entered Peking in the face of obstinate re
sistance, and the members of the foreign legations are
safe. Official confirmation of the fall of the Chinese capital
came to the United States departments to-day in the shape of
two cablegrams, one from Admiral Remey and the other from
Consul Fowler at Chefu. The cablegram from Admiral Remey
came to hand first, early in the evening, followed very soon
after bv that from Consul Fowler. That from Consul Fowler,

I This message was received last evening at the Imperial customs office in
1 London from tbe Commissioner of Customs in Chefu. It is the only offl-
I .clal message that reached England in confirmation of the earlier reports,
"Admiral Remey's dispatch not having arrived. In time tor publication In
the London morning papers.
The Morning Post, which is the only paper printing the Chefu message. iayÂ»;
"To-day Is not only a day of national rejoicing; It is also a day of congratulation

Proceeding to discuss the probabilities of a cessation of hostilities the Morn
ing Post asserts that the United States is willing to abandon any Idea of fur
ther aggressive action, but it questions the disposition of Germany and the other
powers to agree to s>uch a course. :Â»<
The Berlin correspondent of the Morning Post says he learns that no forma!
request for an armistice has yet reached the powers and that it is Improbable
that any such request would be granted.
The other papers comment guardedly on the general situation owing to the
lack of definite news when the editorials were written. Most of them advocate a
stern inquisition regarding outrages and the punishment of the leaders even IX
they have to be pursued all over China.
The Daily Graphic, In a paragraph apparently inspired, says there Is no reason
to believe that any of the powers will repudiate the previous understanding to
respect the integrity of the empire and the dynasty, adding that the proposal to
land a British force at Shanghai originated not In the British Government but
with the Chinese, who at the same time said that this should not ' be done If
likely to lead to international complications.
"This," says the Dally Graphic, "disposes of the story that the Viceroy of
Nanking changed hi3 mind under the Influence of the Consuls. Her Majesty's
Government, we believe, has no intention of contesting the right of France or
the United States to land troops should either think It necessary." \

fipecial Dispatch to The Call.
rALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Aug.
17.â President McKlnley and his Cabinet are rapidly molding into form
Uthe policy that this Government shall pursue respecting the future Govern
ment .of China. Though no final action can, of course, be taken until
full reports on the situation are received from Major General Chaffee and
Minister Conger, it seems certain that tho American troops will not be at once
withdrawn. â¢ -
In anticipation of the liberation of the Ministers and the embarkation of the
United States on important International negotiations, there has been careful de
liberation, and for the last two days the Cabinet has given special attention to
this phase of the Chinese situation. There is no doubt that the President Is de
termined to stand by the declaration made In Secretary Hay's note of- July 3 to
the powers, and it Is Important at thrs juncture. to repeat that statement, to which
all the powers of Europe are at this moment referring:
"It is, of course/too early to forecast the means of attaining this last result
(preventing the recurrence of the present trouble), but the policy of. the Govern
ment of the United States Is to seek a solution which may bring about permanent
safety and peace to China, preserve the Chinese territorial and administrative
entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international
law, and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and Impartial trade with
all parts of the Chinese empire." ;
The administration is now engrossed by a discussion of the' means to attain
these results. The first point to be decided will be whether; the American troops
shall be withdrawn from Peking and China. General Chaffee's recommenda
tion and the views of Minister Conger will, have an important bearing, on : the
action of the administration in this respect. The administration would prefer
that the international troops should not occupy Peking If such occupancy can. be
avoided. It developed at the Cabinet meeting to-day, however, that the Amer
ican troops will probably not be withdrawn until other powers tak# similar ac
tion. >:.':* ''Â¦Â¦ â¢

CONSUL GOODNOW'S
COURSE COMMENDED
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. â The
Navy Department to-day made
public tho report of Colonel
Robert D. Meade and Major L.
W. T. Waller of the United
States Marine Corps on the battle of
Tientsin. Colonel Meadc's report is dated
at Tientsin, July 16. After telling of the
situation around Tientsin and of the de
cision on July 12 at a conference held it
the English general's headquarters to at
tack the city about daybreak the next
day the report, in describing the early
1 fighting, in which the marines and the
I Ninth Infantry took part, says:
! We reached the advanced position about 8
a. tii. I took ISO rounds per man with me â 100
rounds in belts and 80 in the haversacks. This
is not sufficient for an all-day fight, and as It
grew toward night I began to be apprehensive
of being left in tha advanced position in a fight
where no prisoners were taken on either side,
I with only the bayonet to fight with. On tfie
j firing line the action was especially hot and
the enemy's fire especially rapid and accurate,
and at about 8:30 a. m. the enemy appeared in
large numbers upon our. left, among the grave
mounds" of the field in which we were, with the
evident intention of flanking us. I made a turn
ing movement to the left and rear and we drove
them away. Later In the day. about 2 p.m.,
they again made a flanking effort, but at this
time the infantry support of the artillery com
pany was on the mud wall of the city and aided
j us by a crossfire. The effort of the enemy
1 proved a failure and we drove them in.
We remained in the trenches until about 8
p. m., when we received an order from the
brigadier general commanding to withdraw,
which was probably the most difficult action of
the day, since the enemy had Â»o well covered
our position that their phots struck the crests
of the trenches and threw dirt in our faces
many being hit.
j GencraJ Dorward ordered that the troops
' should sleep upon their arms that night and on

The Ninth Regiment was fighting somewhat
outside my sphere of action, so I am able to

hours almost alone i and unsupported, and
never giving back a foot of ground until di

must have been very numerous. The one I
would refer to is the bringing back to me by
the acting regimental adjutant. Captain Law

ment across a wide and flre-swgpt space, and
returning with reinforcements to guide them
to his regiment when he was severely wound

delicate operation, finely carried out, on which
I congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Coolidge and
the oi'flcers and men under his command
Among many instances of personal bravery
in the action I propose especially to brine to
notice in dispatches the conduct of First Lieu

front under heavy and accurate fixe; Lieuten
ant Butler was wounded while so doing, but,
I am glad to learn, not seriously. The regi

Leonard, as Lieutenant Butler was suffering
severely, volunteered to carry him out of the
firing line. This gallant feat he successfully
accomplished, but, I regret to say, was very
dangerously wounded In so doing.
I blame myself for the mistake made in the
taking up of their position by the Ninth Regi
ment, not remembering that troops wholly

their way. Still the position fhey took up and

The troops had had nothing whatever to eat
on the 13th, save the small luncheon which each
man carried in his haversack. It was not ex
pected when we. started that the action would
prove so long, but General Dorward, knowing
the situation, kindly sent to the reservation for
footi and other necessaries and the bivouac
proved a success, and the men, although very
fatigued, were ready for duty.
On the 14th inst., the south gate having been
blown in, we moved into the walled city at
about 6 o'clock a. m. "We found the city filled
â¢with dead Chinese and animals. No resistance
was made to our occupation m the walled city
itself, but an Infantry lire was kept up by the
Japanese infantry upon the enemy, who re
sponded from the suburbs. Since then we have
had undisturbed possession of all Tientsin.
Colonel Meade inclosed the following
letter from General Dorward, the com
mander of the British forces:
Fronr the general officer commanding British
forces In Chinaâ to the officer commanding the

T1KXTSIN. China, July 15, 1900-^Sir: I de

of the high honor accorded to me by having

The American troops formed part o^ the
front line of the British attack, and so had
more than their share of the fighting that took
place. The ready and willing spirit of the
officers and men will always make their com
mand easy and pleasant, and when one adds
to that the. gallantry and power of. holding
on to exposed positions which they displayed on

CHICAGO, Aug. 17.â It i3 pretty certain
that James J. Jeffries will not be seen
in the prize ring for a year at least. Three
eminent New York physicians, who have
been in attendance upon the champion for
months, recently made a thorough exami
nation of Jeffries and decided it would be
fatal for Jeffries even to undergo hard
training.
They say his blood is in very bad con
dition and it would become worse in any
severe exercise. The champion's hones,
they claim, are also affected to such ari
extent they are liable to snap or break irt
a rough contest. Besides. Jim's left arm
Is yet in a very dangerous condition and it
will have to pet at least a year's rest be
fore ha will be able to punch hard with it.

of Spark3. He showed them against
Sparks at the last State fair and was
beaten. Cone resolved this year to be
prepared for such competition, and has
selected in the East the very cream of
Hereford excellence. He has a two-year
old bull which he believes is the equal of
any of his class in America, and is con
fident of winning with him at the fair.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 17.-The livestock
exhibit which has already been entered
for the coming State fair guarantees a
great show. In the Hereford section John
Sparks' famous herd of Reno, Nev., will
be exhibited. This herd has a long ca

HONGKONG MARU BRINGS
MISSIONARY REFUGEES
MOUNT VERNON, N. Y., Aug. 17.â
When Mayor Edwin Fiske mar
ried Alfred T. Reagan and Miss
Angelina Ralston, both of San
Francisco, in the blue room of the
City Hall last night little did he think he
was writing the closing chapter of a ro
mance which began on the Pacific Coast
and ended in New York. It was the end
ing of a romance which started a few
years ago at San Francisco, when both
were at college, and which terminated by
the groom traveling across the continent
for his bride. -
Miss Ralston Is the daughter of Henry
Ralston, director o& the Ralston Iron
Works. She has just passed her twenty
first birthday and is a striking brunette.
She is said to have considerable, wealth
in her own name. \ Reagan, who graduated
from Notre Dame University, Indiana. Is
two years the bride's senior. He studied
law, but is now carrying on a real estate
business in San Francisco. His relatives
are wealthy and he has considerable real
estate in his own right. I
Three years ago Reagan met Miss
Ralston at a friend's home and the young
couple fell madly in love with each other
and were soon engaged. Miss Ralston's
parents, were supposed to be opposed to
the match, and they are said to have tried
every means to break it up. Failing in
their attempts, the parents planned a trip
to Europe. Miss, Ralston and her father
spent six months in touring the Old
World, but constant correspondence was
kept up between the lovers. Reagan fol-
Mrs. Ralston, mother of tho newly made
bride, when seen at her home, 1911 Pierce
street. Ia3t night said:
"Of course, I am sorry the match should
have come about In such a way. I do not
see why they could not get quietly mar
ried at home. Mr. Reagan Is a very
charming young man and I am sure will
make my daughter happy. It- all comes
as a complete surprise to me. although my
daughter used to be much with Mr Rea
gan in this city. Mr, Ralston took'Angie
abroad for a pleasure trip, and I know
they met Mr. Reagan and his father in
New York and that tho . party visited
Paris together. I suppose the acquaint
ance formed Jn San Francisco ripened
into love on the Atlantic."
When the X>eutschland arrived Reasjan
was on the wharf to meet Miss Ralston.
That afternoon Reagan came to Mount
Vernon to visit William A. Walsh who is
assistant corporation counsel and a friend
of Mayor Fiske's. The Mayor, after con
siderable persuasion, consented to per
form the ceremony. The couple arrived
in Mount Vernon last night and went di
rect to the City Hall. The party then ad
journed to. the Mayor's blue room. As
sistant Corporation Counsel William A
Walsh and Assistant Corporation Counsel
UiUiam L. Conlan were the witnesses 1
After the knot was tied the bridal couple
boarded the train for New York
lowed the Ralstora to Parts. Tie learned
that they were to sail on the Deutschlantl
and were due in New York on Tuesday.
He immediately took an earlier steamer
from Paris and landed in New fork City
three daya ahead of the Ralstons.

Eequired to plant us on a solid rock where no opposition can annoy or
destroy. It would be easy for some people to obtain this amount on a
loan, but 'tis easier for us to get it from the sale of goods at half their
real value. This can be done in a few days if the public notices the cut
Â£rived at the house we advised her not to
open the inner inclosure. We carried the
document fo the office of the Chief of
Police and requested him to open it, as
we suspected some trick. In the presence
of Captain of Detectives John Soymour
and Assistant District Attorney Greany
Chief Sullivan op'ened the document and
read it. He and Mr. Greany then placed
their initials on every page of the docu
ment and both envelopes for purpose*
of identification and delivered the papers
back to us.
"This document purports tc be the last
will of the deceased. It leaves the bulk
of the estate to her daughter, Mrs. Mur
ray, and it is evident to me that the pur
pose for which this instrument was pre
pared was to tempt Mrs. Murray to at
tempt to probate it. In that' event the
conspirators would have followed this ad
vantage by coming forward with another
will, more neatly and cleverly forged, and
make an attempt to prove the same to be
the last testament of the deceased. That
this Instrument is a forgery is plain. It
was gotten up by an unlearned woman
unassisted by legal advice, and in addi
tion to being a crimilal scheme to injure
the interest of our client. It involves the
Integrity of the bar of this city.
Boland's Plea Was Brief.
"A short time ago Miss Rattigan re
ceived a letter from Mrs. Bessie Tracey
Smith, addressed to 1416 Clay street, the
same ttrons address to which this forged
will was sent. I do not at this time ac
cuse Mrs. Smith of having committed this
crime, but 1 believe the circumstances are
such as to warrant her examination in
open court. I tried to subper.a her, but
when my clerk reached her door, after
beins informed downstairs that she was
at home, he was Informed that she had
gone into the country for a few weeks.
Mr. Sullivan concluded his statement,
and as soon as the buzz of the whis
pered conversation of the surprised gath
ering had ceased Attorney M. C. Hassett,
on behalf of the Public Administrator,
moved for a continuance. He said he
wanted to secure the testimony of per
sons in Massachusetts, by which he ex
pected to prove that Mrs. Murray is not
a legal resident of this State and had no
intention of becoming such. Judge Dunne
overruled all motions and ordered the
hearing to continue. Sullivan & Sullivan,
; on behalf of Mrs. Murray, filed a contest
to the Public Administrator's petition for
letters cf administration, in which they
set fcrth that Mrs. Murray alone was
entitled to letters, being the daughter and
sole heir of the deceased. Hassett theÂ»i
augmented the record by filing a contest

II \\ Townsend case, but It has been
Jl A thrust into the litigation without

repud'.ated as a forgery by the
only person who would profit by its pro

who was Mrs. Tonnwnd's companion for
ec-vtral years, claims to have received thÂ«?
allesred testament inclosed in an envelope
addressed to her last Tuesday. She
opcne-3 the outer envelope and discovering
that the Inner envelope purported to rn
clo?e the will of Mrs. Townsend she com
municated at once with Sullivan & Sul
li'-an. the attorneys for Mrs. Murray.
They, in company with Miss Rattigan
end Mrs. Murray, went to the office cf
the Chief of Police, where, in consulta
tion with Chief of Detectives John Sey-
Jrour, the inner envelope xras opened and
the alleged will was r<-ad. It Is a peculiar
document, evidently written by an illit
erate person who had some knowledge of
lepal terms. It 13 extremely long and is
dsted July 19. lÂ»0. two days before Mrs.
Tov.nsend died. On many an occasion
Mrs. Townsend had told her confidential
advisers that she never would make a
Â¦will, as she believed that if she did s>o
ehe would die the next day. Two days
Lftcr the mysterious document was dated
Townsend was dead.
The Will Denounced as a Forgery.
This document, which comes fatherless
or.d friendless into the ctpe, bequeaths all
but a few thousand dollars of the estate
of Mrs. Townsc-nd to her daughter, Mrs.
EHa F. Murray. The signature of a Mr?.
M. Bell i^ attached to the alleged testa
ment as a witness. Mrs. Keli is i:s mys
terious as the will. The police have been
eenrchirig for her Klnc<* Tuesday, and &1
thevgh they have interrogated every Mrs.
Bell in the city they have found no one
vho 5ign*<3 thÂ» document. N'one of the
friestii of Mrs. Townsend ever heard or
knew of a Mrs. Bell of her acquaintance,
and Mips Rattirran says that she certain
ly would know if there had been one.
Eulllvan A Sullivan do not hesitate to
charge that the will is a clumsy forgery
introduced into the affair by persons op-
I oppc to Mrs. Murray. ThÂ» attorneys nl
ieged in court yesterday that the super
scription on the letter addressed to Miss
Kfctttgan and containing the will .is re
markably like that on a letter sent by
Mrs. Bessie Tracey Smith to the same
young lady. Mrs. Smith is the woman
who declared her belief that Mrs. Town-
Bend had made a will and had placed it
in a secret receptacle, which Mrs. Smith
thought she could find. She was not pei
muteci. however, to make a search. Sulli
van & Sullivan objecting on the ground
that h. bogus will might be dropped in the
house.
Sullivan Charges a Crime.
Sim-f Mrs. Ella F\ Murray and her at-
Icrr.evs have repudiated the alleged' will
tho document can serve no purpose to thtÂ»
other interested parties in the contro
versy. The testament bequeaths every
thing except a few thousand dollars to
Mrs. Murray, repudiates Mrs. Townsend's
c-x-husband and cuts off any other heirs
who might appear. The appearance of
the document will play, therefore, no ma
terial part in the case.
The introduction of the alleged forged
will created yesterday the surprise of the
day's proceedings. Judge Dunne, who,
during the absence of Judge Troutt. oc
cupied the bench in department 10, called
the matter of the estate of the late Al
mira S. Townsend for hearing, and At
torney G. Gunzendorfer, representing
Thomas T. Townsend, former husband of
the deceased, immediately moved for a
continuance. Attorney Matt Sullivan, of
the firm of Sullivan & Sullivan, represent
ing Mrs. Murray, rose to oppose the mo
tion and incidental! j- to shower divers sur
prises among counsel and audience.
"Townsend is trifling with this court,"
paid Mr. Sullivan. "If he !s entitled to
letters he should have applied for the
same long ago. This man has been twice
divorced and thrice remarried since Mrs.
Townsend secured her decree. I have
every reason to believe that a conspiracy
exists to loot this estate. Last Tuesday
Miss Nellie Rattigan, the companion and
nearest friend of Mrs. Townsend, received
through the mails a letter addresstd to
her at her home. It contained a sealed
envelope with an inscription in tremDling
hand declaring its contents to be the last
will and testament of the deceased.
"Upon tho receipt of this document
Miss Rattigan immediately sent for
my brother and myself. When we ar-
to Mrs. Murray's application for letters
of administration, in which It was alleged
that she was a non-resident and as such
was ncit entitled to administer decedent's
estate.
Mrs. Murray's petition for letters was
then cailcd, but Hassett Insisted that the
application filed by the Public Adminis
trator should be heard first. He failed to
conceal his surprise when Matt Sullivan
consented to this arrangement. Hassett
soon recovered and again demanded a
continuance. Again it was denied, and
being forced to present his case, called
Public Administrator Boland to the stand.
Mr. Boland gave evidence as to his offlt !
cial character. Hassett then introduced^
his application for letters in evidence,
mounted the stand, testified that dece
dent's estate was worth at least $307,000,
and announced that his case was closed.
"If that is all your evidence," said Matt
Sullivan. "1 fool it my duty to inform you
that you have failed to prove three es
sential facts: the death of Mrs. Town
send, her residence and that she died in
testate. These facts merely prove juris
diction, and to save you trouble we will
admit them."
Mrs. Townsend Said She Would Make
No Will.
Hassett's case was submitted and Mrs.
Murray's -application was ordered heard.
John T. Harms, of the firm of Madison &
Burke, was her first witness.- He testi
fied that he had managed Mrs. Town
send's business, and that the income from
her realty was !7G0 a month. In 1SD4 Mrs.
Townsend introduced him to Mrs. Mur
ray. Later she informed him that Mrs.
Murray was her daughter, but asked him
to say nothing of the fact until occasion
offered. On one occasion when Mrs
Murray was ill, Mrs. Townsend told the
witness that she hoped her daughter
would not die. "If she does I have noth
ing to live for." she said. Last July Mr
Harms advised Mrs. Townsend to execute
a will. She said at that time thai she
would not make a will, but instructed
him that if death should come to her im
mediately to wire Mrs. Murray, if she
was away from the city. Mrs. Townsend's
superstition, he concluded, was, in his
opinion, responsible for the fact that she
died intestate.
Miss Rattigan followed Mr. Harms to
tho. stand. She said that for six years
she had been Mrs. Townsend's constant
companion. She had lived with the de
ceased all of that time, she said, and so
far as she knew Mrs. Townsend never
made a will.
Cyrus W. Carmany, cashier of the Sav
ings and l^ian Society, proved an inter
esting witness. He was eonlident that
Mrs. Townsend ntver made a will, "it 1
make a will," she told him, "1 am afraid
that I will die the next day." "And she
never made a will for this reason I fully
believe," said Mr. Carmany. Continuing
Mr. Carmany testified that another reason
that might have prompted Mrs. Townsend
to defer making a will was the fact that
she never knew how much she was worth
until aftei the witness prepared a state
ment of her assets and told her the
amount of her annual income. This the
witness did shortly before Mrs. Town
send's death.
"Mrs. Townsend was astounded when I
told her the exact value of her holdlnga
and income," said' the witness. "I am
positive that she told me all of her busi
ness, and by this I was enabled to make
a positive estimate. Her personal prop
erty at the time I made the statement*
was worth $275,000 and the realty $307 WO
Si?ice that time the value of the estate
has Increased from $12,000 to 515,000 a year
and her income was $2000 a month, an
amount' much . in excess of her expendi
tures. Â¦ >
"I knew Mrs. Townsend since 1S65. She
followed my advice at all times as to in
vestments ar.d business matters. Her pri
vate efTects, such^as deeds, abstracts,
bonds and other securities, . have been in
the bank for about eighteen years, and
di'ring that time sho has always counseled
with -me. so I am : confident she d*d not
moke a will.
Mrs. Murray the Object of Her
Mother's Bounty.
"We had several conversations regarding
a will. These conversations began two
years ago, 'and the last we held a short
Unit* before her deathâ I < believe the last
being about three months ago. I met
Mrs.. Murray on several occasions, Mrs.
1'ov/r.send introducing me to her, and t
always believed thtfm to be 'sisters. I as
sumed this from various conversations re-
Raiding money which I was to send East
to Mrs. Murray, and also because she re
ferred to her grandchild as her niece,"
At this point the witness wag handed
over to Mr. Hnssett for cross-examination.
He started out to Investigate the relations
that ' once existed between the " deceased
and the late J. C.'Wilmerding, but as the
court failed '; to see tho relevancy of . this
line of questioning Hassett pursued an
other line of -examination. In answer to
his Interrogatories Mr. Â¦ Carmany Fald:
"1 : sent considerable money to Mrs. . Mur
ray when she was in the East,' and finally,

THE BATTLE FOR MRS. ALMIRA S. TOWNSEND'S ESTATE HAS BEGUN.
ATTORNEYES OF MRS. ELLA F. MURRAY PRODUCE IN COURT
A DOCUMENT CLAIMED TO BE A FORGED WILL OF MRS. TOWNSEND
r? NEVER wrote that will, nor did I know anything about It. I shall go to
Judge Dunne to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock and tell him I am ready
j| and anxious to answer any and all questions he may wish to put to me."
Those are the words with which Mrs. Bessie Smith last evening met
the question in regard to the alleged forged will of Mrs. Almira S. Towns
end, with which Judge Sullivan startled Judge Dunne's court yesterday.
Knowledge cf what had passed in the courtroom was brought to Mrs. Smith's
attention by means of the evening papers. So great was the lady's astonish
ment at the implied charge of the attorney that the enormity of the offense
she had been practically charged with did* not dawn upon her until she began
calmly to <liscu#-s the matter with the Interviewer.
"Practically." said Mrs. Smith, "Judge Sullivan declares that I am guilty
of forgery. Such a thins Is not only utterly false, but preposterous and
ridiculous as well. Why should I do such a thing? What interest should^I
have In doing- such a thins? And what puzzles me most is. What is their
object in wishing to fasten such a thing on me?"
"I wrote to* Miss Rattlgan." continued Mrs. Smith, "to ask her to return
to me pictures of myself and son that had belonged to Mrs. Townsend and
Â¦were in the California-street home. Before I wrote to Miss Rattigan I called
her home up by telephone and inquired for her. Whoever it was that came
to the Rattlgan Iphone In answer to my call was extremely guarded in her
answers to my questions. She told me Miss Nellie Rattigan was not at home,
that she did not know where Miss RatUgan was and that she was not sure
when Miss Rattlgan would be home. Finally I asked if a letter addressed
to her at the Rattlgan home would reach her. What the answer to that ques
tion was I really do not remember. However. I wrote the letter and got
the address out of one of the two telephone books in my mother's room. I
do not remember where I posted that letter. I am under the Impression that
I brought it to the postbox at the corner near the Bella Vista, although I
may have dropped It In the box in the Bella Vista hall. Miss Rattlgan
' never answered that letter. Neither did she return to me my photograph.
\ "At the same time that I wrote to .Miss Rattlgan," continued Mrs. Smith.
[ "I wrote to the Wllmerdings in New York. I told them that Mrs. Townsend
, was dead'and there were many photographs in the houseâ Wilmerdlng photo
i graphs â that they might wish to keep and which were of no value to any
Â¦ one but to them. My interest in the "Wllmerdlngs la that of a relative."
' explained Mrs. Smith. "My father was first cousin to J. C. Wilmerdlng.* My
grandmother was a Wilmerdlng." Â»,
Mrs. Smith admits that she did know a subpena had been issued for her.
' "The boy who was to serve It." oald the lady, "called at the Bella Vista
\ while I was out. Mother, however, was in. and he showed the paper to her,
, explaining at the same time its purpose. When I heard of it I thought they
. wished to get me In court to testify as to that secret panel. I was tired of
â¢ the notoriety the thing had brought upon me and as I had never been
' served I did not go."
' Mrs. Smith, however, Is going to court thl3 morning. She will go alone.
I without even an attorney to assist and. If need be, protect her. "But why
should I have an attorney?" Mrs. Smith asked. "I have only got the truth
Â¦ to tell, and. I don't need an attorney for that."

she was rooming at the Sutherland. She

Mr. Hassett then made an effort to
prove a strange condition of affairs in
the fact that Mrs. Murray had the keys
to Mrs. Townsend's safe deposit vaults,
but the admission of Mr. Sullivan that
she always had the keys since her
mother's death, as she had.a right to the
same, deprived Mr. Hassett of an oppor

collateral heirs of the deceased, sought
additional information. Mrs. Murray was
then called to testify in support of her
petition for letters.
Mrs. Murray Weeps on the Stand,
f. Her testimony was dramatic in the ex
treme. At times she was in tears, hardly
able to control her convulsive emotion as
she told of the death of her daughter and
of the sadness which had come into her
life only a few months before the tragic
end of her mother's life. Again she was
snappingly defiant as she insisted that she
had come to this city to reside perma
nently, to be as best she could a comfort
to her jiother in her last years. She ana
her mother were alone in the world, she
said, and she determined to come here.
The question of residence was the vital
point and upon that Mrs. Murray never
wavered. There were no tears, no hesita
tion, no doubts; she was aggressively em
phatic, needlessly so it seemed, as she
declared that on July 9 last she had ar
rived in this city here to remain for tho
remainder of her life. On the witness
stand she was theatrically deliberate and
when her direct examination was con
cluded she arose and in her own behalf
addressed the court, asking it to hasten
the determination of the matter as she
was ilKand under a great nervous strain.
Mrs. Murray declared that she was born
in Lov. ell, Mass.. on October 4, 1849. the
daughter and only child of Thomas T.
Townsend and Almira S. Townsend. fene
outlined the various phases of her edu
cation and said she was married in Dor
chester, in 1S71, to John S. Murray. In the
following year her daughter Mabel was
born and lived Until April of this year.
As she told of the; girl's death she hes
itated, burst into tears and was unable
to speak except sobblngly. Then followed
a long examination to determine when she
had been here and under what conditions.
She came here in 1S92 and in 1S94, and on
both occasions, she claimed, she was
favorably received by her mother, obtain
ing from the elder woman gifts of money,
clothinsr and various entertainment.

Sorrow.
Under no circumstances was she per

Mrs. Townsend would never permit it to
be known that she was the mother of
Mrs. Murray, even when the latter was
only 10 years of age. In all their relation
ships therefore this tie was never ac
knowledged. Through all her life, Mrs.
Murray swore, she had written to Mrs.
Townsend addressing her as "Dear
mother." Mrs. Townaend had in many
ways assisted her, and when her great

Sullivan & Sullivan, the attorneys for
Mrs. Klla F. Murray, do not Intend to let
the production of the mysterious will rest
with their sensational course of action in
court yesterday. They insist that the al
leged will is a clumsy forgery, made by
conspirators to injure Mrs. Murray and
trifle with the court. They declare that
a felony has been committed, and they
call upon the Grand Jury to make a thor
ough investigation of the entire affair. The
following letter was sent yesterday by the
lawyers to the Grand Jury:
SAX FRANCISCO.' Auff. 17. 1300.
To the Honorable tho Grand Jury of the
Mrs. Murray's Attorneys Ask That
APPEAL TO GRAND JURY.
"I had lost my daughter," she said,
"and I was alone in the world. My
mother was alone and along in years, and
I determined to come to her to remain
with her or near her, as she determined,
and to comfort her as best I could for the
rest of my life. I was not shouting my
.purpose from the housetops; my private
business was not the concern of other
people."
Jn one of the letters Mrs. Murray re
ferred to her father as "an old rascal."
a characterization which did not seem to
please Mr. Townsend yesterday as he sat
in the courtroom.
In conclusion. Mrs. Murray recited the
events which followed her mother's
death. She had searched everywhere in
the house, but no will could be found.
Slie had made the search faithfully and
honorably, and she gave the court every
assurance that had she found a will she
certainly would have dellevcred it to the
court whether it had been for or against
her. She will be cross-examined Monday
morning at 10 o'clock.
Came Sere to Remain for Life.
To prove this fact and to demonstrate
that Mrs. Murray came to this city to
make it her home through a distinct un
derstanding with her mother a series of
letters and telegrams was Introduced.
These documents were of exceptional in
terest. Most of them were written in May
of this year, when Mrs. Murray wrote
that her child and last living close rela
tive was dead. She asked for sympathy
and assistance, and received both. Mrs.
Townsend wrote in her letters that she
was tired of San Francisco and everybody
in it. Her husband was annoying her;
there were countless demands upon her;
she was in ill health and she was deter
mined to leave the city as soon as she
could settle her affairs. Later she wrote
to Mrs. Murray saying that she would
leave to her whether she should come to
this city or Mrs. Townsend should go to
the East. Mrs. Murray chose, she said,
to come here. She placed her property
for sale in the East and arrived here on
July 0 to stay for the rest of her days.

Charles Vogelsang. Deputy Fish Com
missioner, has recently returned from
Orovllle. The obfect of his visit was to
superintend the blowing up of an old dam
on the Yuba a few miles above the town
This was accomplished, but in the execu
tion one of the dynamite cartridges was
accidentally exploded below the dam and
several hundred striped bass were killed
by the concussion. This was proof con
clusive that the fish reached as far up
the river as the obstructing dam.
Fishing has picked up a bit on the
Truckee, but the best of the summer fish

Eel and Upper McCloud, but the best
sport is to be enjoyed at present on Mon

paying an entrance fee and $5 a month
thereafter. If the dues of the amalga

REVOLVER EXPERTS WHO HAVE MADE RECORDS.
Within the last few weeks a movement has been on foot tending toward the arrangement of revolver matches be
tween shots of this city and representatives of the East. There Is every promise that It will end successfully. It
is proposed that a committee, composed of representatives of the local W*bs, National Guard and 'citizens, which will
t;tke charge of all features of the projected match, be appointed. Selectlcf of a team or teams shall be by competition
only, the highest to shoot in whatever events may ' be arranged. A suitable trophy Is already In sight, according to
the statement of one of the gentlemen interested, to be presented to the winning team. Of course, such match will
have to be shot on the home ranges of each club and the results forwarded by telegraph and letter. It seems to be
the desire of the promoters of this matter to have the matches of the military order, that la the marksmen shall shoot
with revolvers of a pattern adopted by the militia or suitable for army use. This would be a bar to fancy target
sights, special ammunition and "extras," such as the cranks revel In. The argument is made, and correctly too, that a
man who is a good shot with a target revolver can also acquit himself with credit with a service Â¦weapon. A meeting
will be called within a week or so to bring about a few, matches of the kind desired. It is proposed that no man or
clique shall have the control or management of these events, but that air shall have an opportunity to enter into the
competitions. -C-'.-'s
"While the revolver shots in the East were preparing for the big international match local sportsmen were keep
ing pace and comparing their work with those who were to shoot for the honor of America, which was upheld by a ma
jority of 61 points. Shortly after the victory- by the American team a number of local marksmen concluded that a team
of San Francisco revolver shots could be assembled which could give the victorious Easterners a lively rub in a thirty
or fifty shot match. It is believed that if such men as J. E. Gorman, A. B. Dorrell, Smith Carr. Ed Hovey, M. J.
White, F. O. Young, Charlie Daiss, A. H. Pape, Paul Becker, George Barley and a few others would try they could put
up a lively race with the Eastern team.
San Francisco has a number of revolver Ehots whose individual performances are of such high-class order that
they stand on a level with the crack shots of the country. The attached targets tell a story In themselves. The one
with the three shots in the one-inch circle was mode by J. E. Gorman on January 23, 1S98. at the Shell Mound ranges.
It is the result of shooting at a distance of fifty yards, open sight, off hand and with a two-pound pull. Tho other 'by
Charles M. Daiss was made on April 9, 1S99, on the same ranges under the same conditions.
The champions were fortunate In meet
ing the Oakland team last week, for they
found the Dudes In the most crippled con
dition that they have been In since the
opening of the season. They have no oc
casion, therefore, for pointing with pride
to their record, for though they moved
up a peg. still they lost one game and per
mitted the Frlscos to make a slight gain.
This week the champions will meet Har
per's aggregation. Stockton Is overdue on
a clean score and It would not be sur
prising If they succeeded In putting the
champions back.
The loss of two games last week by the
Stocktons gave the Friscos a hold on sec
ond place and Oaklr.nd moved farther
down the toboggan.
This is the way the clubs stand:
Sacramento Still Leading
From Afar and the
* Dudes Trailing.

An Offer to the City Council That
Will Probably Be Accepted and
Will Fulfill All

SAX DIEGO, Aug. 17.â The pnppeet that
the water troubles of the city of San
Diego will soon be definitely settled has
caused considerable joy on the part of the
reople. It has been made known that K.
S. Babcocli, representing John D. Spreck
cls and the Southern California Mountain
Water Company, has made such an offer
to the City Council that its acceptance
and the completion of the contract that
will follow will give to the city a bounti
ful supply of mountain water.
The Southern California Mountain
Water Company's system embraces throe
immense reservoirs in the mountains to
the southeast of the city, the three to be
connected by tunnels, flumes and ditches.
This system is only partially completed,
though one reservoir Is finished and is
now full.
Inside the city the Mountain Water
Company, under tho name of United
Water Supply Company, owns a distrib
uting system in the businesa portion of
the city.^on which the work was stop
ped when a former proposition of the
same company was carried into the courts
and contested. The present offer of the
company Is to complete the laying of the
pipe, making a system of about seven, and
a half miles o* large mains. This syitem
the Mountain Water Company proposes to
sell to the city for $100,000 and to pur
chase $600,000 of city bonds at par as soon
aÂ« voted, turning- the other $503,000 Into
tho city treasury for tho completion of

the distributing system throughout the
city.
The water company further proposes to
furnish the city with water at the rate
of 5 cents per 1000 gallons until th.e com
pletion of the pipe line from the Otay
dam, which is the reservoir already com
pleted and filled, after which time the
price per 1000 gallons will be but 4 cents.
The company further agrees to furnish
all the water that the city can use up
to 7,000,000 gallons per day, which is more
than double what the present water com
pany claims to be pumping and more than
four times the amount that is actually
being pumped.
The Council has directed that all neces
eary papers be prepared for it on next
Monday evening, so that It can conclude
its acceptance of the offer. An election
will be called for the purpose of submit
ting the bond proposition to the voters
at as early a date as possible.

for Congress.

PRUNE-GROWERS ANXIOUS.
Awaiting the Fixing of Prices by
the Combine.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 17.â Considerable anx
iety is manifested among the prune
growers In regard to the prices to be
fixed by the association. At the head
quarters of the combine It was stated to
day that there was no announcement to
be made yet.
Growers not In the association are in
a rather embarrassing position, according
to statements made. Buyers and driers
who are not In the combine are diffident
about buying. They are waiting for prices
to be fixed. Some crops are ready to be
harvested. Growers who belong to the
association can deliver to their own driers
and secure advances to meet current ex
penses. It is difficult to get satisfactory
estimates as to the yield. Doubtless many
prunes have "dropped," yet careful men
say the total output of this valley win
be large, owing to many new orchards
coming into bearing.

damage. Walter Hobart shone to much
advantage in the saddle, twice finishing
first astride the sturdy little Slats and be
ing placed with his only other mount. Six
events were down for decision and the
favorites captured three.
The San Mateo Hunt steeplechase, with
the usual element of danger thrown in,
attracted the most attention and resulted
in a really Fur>erb contest between old

There is a vast amount of dissatisfac
tion over tho declaring off of the base

kicking hard. Some trivial dispute caused
Prescott Scott to declare off the game.
The Alumni team arrived to-night. They

to the Attack on Him Regarding

Inquiry. /
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 17.â State Sena
tor Frank Leavitt resents the attack
made on him In one of the San Francisco
newspapers,- declaring It Is prompted by
motives of revenge.
The article to which Leavitt takes ex
ception stated that he and Senate Clerk
Brandon, the latter the clerk for Leavltfa
committee, were making a farce- of the in
vestigation into the conduct of the Sta'e
Printing Office, which inquiry had been
ordered by the State Senate; that Stat-Â»
Printer Johnston had given Leavitt a
position as bookkeeper in the printing es
tablishment in order to prevent an ad
verse report; that neither Leavitt nor
Brandon was properly fulfilling hi3
duties, and that Leavitt Is scheming to
become State Printer.
Senator Leavitt, in an Interview with a
representative of The Call to-night, said:
It was evident to the committee, when it first
met, tiiat it would require several months to
{rather the' facts and figures that the state
Senate desired In the Investigation of the print
ing office. The State Printer wanted the inves
tigation to be complete as to the following
rumors:
That he had sold type, presses and paper and
had appropriated to his own use the proceeds;
that the men working ia the institution were
required to give up a portion of their wages
and that the payroll had been stuffed.
The suggestion was made to me by State
Printer Johnston that I accept a position under
him long enough to ascertain the truth or fal
sity of those rumors. I refused to accept thÂ«
position until I had consulted with the Gover
nor about the matter.. The Governor requested
me to take the position, as It would assist me
in obtaining the Information desired by the
committee. Senate Cleric Brandon's position as
clerk of the investigation committee was ob
tained for him by Senator Shortridge. another
member ot the committee. Brandon's work
needs no apology. The work of Brandon and
myself will be judged by the Senate, when It
will be shown to have been of great value to
the State. I attribute the Chronicle's attack
upon me as the result of my attitude on the
candidacy of M. II. de Young for the United

WASHINGTON, Aug. 17.
Reports from General Randall,
who is in command of the mil
itary department of Alaska,
indicates that great suffering
Â¦will be the fate of stranded
miners at Nome and other
places. The situation is de
scribed as worse than that of
two years ago, when the War
Department expended $200,-
OOO in relieving the distress
of the miners. Secretary Root
is considering an estimate
which he may have to send to
Congress in December for aid
necessary to tho.se in distress.
It is likely that the amount
asked of Congress will bs fully
$300,000. General Randall
says it is not merely a lack of
funds which embarrasses the
authorities in Alaska, but the
difficulties of purchasing sup
plies and "transporting the
men.

pilot of the Aquilla; F. W. Steeley and
Amlal W. Grafton, all from Dawson. It is
stated that the Aquilla ran on the rocks
on the Healey bar while bound for Eagle
City and was completely wrecked. The
Jive men making up the party were all
aboard at the time. , There was quite a
bit of rough weather at the time and be
fore any assistance could reach them they
were all drowned.
A report which was received at Daw
son just before the last steamer left was
to the effect that one of the men, Maurice
Marsden, had been picked up in the. river
by a passing steamer, floating on a piece
of board, two miles below the scene of the
nccident.

Commissioner Stevens has decided that
the beach above high-water mark is now

the seashore was covered for miles by
rockers, pluiceboxes, engines and other
paraphernalia for mining, all In active
operation. Within two days not less than
half the operations ceased as a result of
orders from persons claiming the ground
by right of location. Several hundred
beach workers, disgusted with the situa

The beach was stampeded for many
miles and everything located. Judge

BY reason of the freedom of speech and personal
liberty assured by British laws. Great Britain
â¢ has long been the refuge of political exiles and
schemers from every country in Europe. It has been
known that among the foreigners resident in London
and other large cities there are considerable numbers
of anarchists, but it has been the prevalent belief that
there are no anarchists among native Britons. That
belief has now been shattered. It appears there has
been an active inculcation of the principles of anarchy
going on for some time in all parts of the United
Kingdom, and that while the number of converts to
the doctrine are few, they are by no means so weak
as to be despicable.
The assassination of King Humbert led to an inves
tigation by the London Chronicle of the anarchist
propaganda in Britain, with the result that quite a
iiumber of anarchist groups were discovered. One
cf the correspondents writing on the subject say.?:
"For some fifteen years past there has been an or
ganized anarchist movement in this country, run
mainly by British subjects, most of whom were Eng
lish and Scots, with a sprinkling of Irishmen. The
'Autonomy group,' now broken up, was made up
chiefly of foreigners, but there are and have been
'groups' in Manchester, Walsall, Aberdeen, Glasgow,
Liverpool, Norwich, Birmingham, Arbroath and
ether large cities and towns for some time, in which
the foreigner was in a distinct minority. I remember
one particular group in Manchester some six years
ago. It consisted of about forty persons, among
whom were a fully certificated schoolmaster, a draw
ing-master in a local school and a journalist, the
remainder being clerks and workmen. The rival
group was composed cf foreigners, who were mostly
Jews, German, Polish, Russian and Dutch. In Glas
gow the anarchists have always availed themselves of
the opportunities given by the university. Many of
the members are biologists and chemists, with a thor
ough familiarity with the latest developments in the.
field of scientific research. The Scottish anarchist is,
as a rule, better, educated than his English confrere,
and, from what I have . seen, with one or two
exceptions, the Irish anarchists are the least educated
of all. There are no anarchists in Ireland. The at
tempts to establish groups in Belfast and Dublin have
i been failures." Â¦ .
The writer goes on to say. that frequently distin
guished anarchists, such as Krapotkin, Grave : and
ethers, make a tour of the provinces, visitingthediffer
ent local groups and stimulating them to greater efforts
toward the advancement of the cause. He attribute?
the riots of the uncmplc3'ed in Liverpool, Manchester
and Glasgow, a few. years ago. mainly to the work of
local anarchist agitators. Thus it appears that while
not numerically strong, the British anarchists are still
sufficiently potent to be a notable factor in social.dis
turbances. \

ANARCH'STS IN GREAT BRITAIN.
CORN AND KflNSAS.
CORN and Kansas are booming together, but
there is no inseparable connection between
them. Corn booms whether in Knnsas or out
of it, and Kansas booms not only in her cornfields,
but in her wheatfields as well. Nevertheless the two
things are closely associated with one another and
serve equally well to refute the predictions of calamity
which Bryan howled over all the corn States in the
last Presidential campaign.
Reports from Kansas are to the effect that farmers
are so prosperous there is a widespread inclination to
exchange town lots for farm lands. A few years ago
the rural population was discontented and thousands
of people were trying to get rid of the farms in order
to move to town. Now the reaction has taken place,
and the town folks, seeing the abundant and profitable
crops of the farmers, are trying to get farms of their
own.
A correspondent of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat
tells a good story illustrating the changed condition
of affairs. He says: "Out in the western part of
Sedgvvick County Sweet, the banker at Cheney, came
into possession of 160 acres at a cost of $2200 several
years ago. vile, tried to sell it at an advance of $200
or $300, but couldn't find a. purchaser. Last fall Mr.
Sweet sent East and bought enough of the new va
riety of wheat to seed the land. About the last of
April the wheat looked so. fine" that farmers began to
ask the banker his price. The banker, too, thought
the wheat looked pretty well, and he advanced his
figures to $3200, or $20 an acre. Even this did not
frighten off the farmers. George Johnson, on an ad
joining place, took Mr. Sweet at his own figure. That
crop of wheat has been harvested and thrashed. It
went over thirty-four bushels to the acre, and the
measured bushel weighed sixty-three pounds, the
maximum of- grade. This crop of wheat, the seed
and sowing of which cost Johnson nothingi has prac
tically returned to the owner the price he paid for
I the land three months ago."
That is the story of a wheat farm, but there are just
as good to be told of the corn districts. The days
when farmers burned corn because it was the cheap
est fuel they could get have gone by. It also appears
they do not even have to feed it to hogs or cattle in
order to make a paying crop out of it. The people
of Europe are learning to eat corn bread and corn
' meal mush, and the demand for it is growing. The
j Dallas News recalls the prediction of Tilden that
j eventually the United States would export more corn
j than wheat, and sanguinely expects the realization # to
, be attained within a comparatively few years. It says
j an acre of corn land will feed more people than an
i acre of the best wheat -land, and that when the wheat
supply falls short corn can more than take its place.
It will be seen that in deciding to talk this year
about imperialism instead of about calamity Mr.
Bryan has shown as much discretion as can; be ex

and tt\zj. L/rt ns get ready for a hard fight and pre
pare for brifigxsg to the polls on election day the full
strength of the Republican party of the city.
There is nothing to be gained by postponing reg
istration, but there is much that may be lost. When
the rush oi the closing days comes it will then be in
conx-enier.t to register, for a man may frequently have
to stand for a long time in line waiting his turn. Then
is business of all kinds revives with the beginning of
the fall trade, it will not be 60 easy as now for business
ir.cn to attend to the matter. Moreover, some accident
of time or chance may in the last days of registration
intervene to prevent a man from having his name en
rolled. Thus from every point of view it is best to
attend to the duty at ence. â¢
It is a strange thing that the Democrats, with a dis
credited national platform and Presidential candidate,
and with hardly a hope of success in the contest,
should yet display more political activity than Repub
licans, whose platform and whose leader represent
the prosperity cf the present and the best promise
of the future, sr.d who can look forward to victory in
the city, the State z-ni the nation. Why should Re
publicans be laggard and dilatory in performing the
essential prelim-nary to all the acth'ities of the cam
paign? The voter who does not register disfran
chises himself, throws away his rights as a citizen and
surrenders a privilege which he ought to regard as
cne of the highest thr.t belongs to a freeman.
REGISTRATION in San Francisco up to date
is far from satisfactory, but such as it is shows
more favorable to Democracy than to Repub
licanism. h is evident that, in this city the over san
guine feeling of assured victory of which the ablest
Iinders ha\c warned the party prevails to a dangerous
extent. Of course there is still ample time for all
Republicans to rcg^ter, but none the less the delay
ii a sign of comparative indifference in the matter.
- . Â«i i_ ' r> wi
lt is an evidence that a large number oi Republicans
have not yet become thoroughly aroused to the im
portance of the issues before them and to a sense of
their political duties.

I N the -collection of Oriental Idols be-
I longing to James E. Rlchardsonof New
I York is one with a curious history.
Cast at Shwebo, in upper Burmah, In
the early decades of the eighteenth
century, it was exported to Havre, in
French Tonquin. For perhaps ten years,
according to native accounts, it stood un
noticed at the temple Kuan-Yin. During
the destruction of that edifice by fire, In
which most of the idols were lost, it was
saved by a priest, and as the temple was
not immediately rebuilt remained in his
possession for several years. During sec
tarian troubles the priest fled to the coast,
taking with him the idol. At a small vil
lage he found an isolated band of Bud
dhists, who hailed with joy the advent of
a priest, and the image was Installed in a
tiny temple on the shores of the Gulf of
Tonquin. From the time of the priest's
arrival the little community seemed to
prosper and wonderful cures of dread dis
eases wore ascribed to the influence of
the little idol.
In the year 1750 the French bark rEsper
ance lay" in the Gulf of Tonquin. Some of
her crew having been given shore leave.
discovered the little shrine, and in the twi
light of the interior, mistaking tho semi
precious stor.es and tiny metal mirrors set
Sn the cincture which garlanded the calm
brows of the god for jewels of price, plot
tod to ravish the shrine and steal the im
age. Late that night a boat set out from
l'Ksperance and under cover of darkness
the conspirators pained the shore. The
temple was reached without incident, and
one Jean Pitou. the boatswain, walking
boldly to the front of the apparently de
serted temple and followed by the rest of
the men, plucked the bronze from its
pedestal. He then dropped it into the open
mouth of a hag held in readiness by the
ship's bow While the robbers were quiet
ly chuckling among themselves at their
success something leaped forth from the
gloom, and Pitou. with a sobbing cry. fell,
stabbed to the heart. Instantly the little
temple was alive with men, who grappled
with the sailors. One of the latter whipped
the sack from the hands of the boy and
ran for his life. The ship'3 boy was quick
ly dispatched and his shrill cries rang
through the night. Two others of the
party rt-mained: one of these, in his con
fusion, ran directly away from the b*ach
and apparently escaped, while the last of
the party was stabbed In the abdomen.
Two men had been left in charge of the
beached boat, and as the hunted sailor,
still incumbered with his bag, came leap
ing down the beach pursued by a half
dozen of the lightly sleeping and now
thoroughly aroused natives, frenzied at
the Indignity offered their divinity, the
sailors on the boat fired, but without ef
fect. The fugitive threw the bag into the
boat and* putting his shoulder to the bow
pushed her off into the water. The men
in her sprang to their cars and pulled clear
just as a mighty stroke from the short
sword of the foremost in pursuit clove the
last of the unfortunate men from crown
to chin. The others in the boat reached
the ship in safety, and just a3 dawn was
breaking the sailor who had run Into the
woods swam back to the ship, recounting
how the crew had beer, butchered.

THE WORST FOLLY YET.
AEDSUMMER madness appears to be raging in
the camp of the mugwumps this year with
unsurpassed fury. A greater number of them
than ever before are as mad as March hares, and
their madness takes on a sufficient variety of forms to
slock a lunatic asylum. Some of them wish to start
a "Third party," notwithstanding there are already ten
Presidential tickets 211 the field; some declare they
will vote for Bryan, notwithstanding they are op
posed to his party and his platform, and now a new
set come forward with a proposition to cast the mug
wump vote for McKinley for President and Bryanites
for Congress.
The last named movement has its headquarters at
Washington. The New York Commercial Adver
tiser quotes a correspondent from the capital as say
ing: "Of all recent publications on the subject of the
national campaign, the one which has made the
deepest impression upon the political managers on
both sides here is the letter of Charles Francis Adams,
suggesting the election of McKinley and a Demo
cratic House of Representatives. Already, it is un
derstood, money has been coming in to the Demo
cratic Congressional Campaign Committee from dis
satisfied Republicans. This movement began before
the publication of Mr. Adams' letter, but that docu
ment has done much to stimulate it."
We believe this to be about the worst folly in
which mugwumpery is engaged. It is at any rate the
cue that will be most dangerous if it be carried out
on anything like an extensive scale. The control of
the House of Representatives is the danger point of
the contest, and there are many districts where the
votes of a comparatively few discontented Republi
cans cast for Bryan candidates might result in the
election of a Democratic House. The country would
then have a divided Government, and all the great
measures which the Republicans have devised for pro
moting national progress, and which should be en
acted by. the next Congress, would be postponed for
years.
-The man who in this contest contributes to the suc
cess of the Bryan candidate for Congress in any dis
trict may call himself a "dissatisfied Republican," but
he will be anything rc-ther than a Republican. He
will be just as much a supporter of free silver, free
trade, national socialism and all the other Populist
fads of the time as if he supported Bryan himself.
The issues of the contest cannot be divided. The
man who is contented with the progress the country
is making under the present administration, and who
will vote and work to maintain the administration in
order that prosperity may increase for years to come
as it has done ever since McKinley was elected, is a
Republican; but all else are virtually Bryanites. In
other words, there ire no discontented Republicans,
and can be none, for "discontent" is the watchword
of Bryanism.
QUEER CURIO THAT COST
LIVES OF THE LOOTERS
declared by British anarchists to be absolutely in
applicable as far as this country is concerned. They
justify their use abroad, in Russia, Italy and Spain,
on account of the tremendous despotism, military
and otherwise, in those countries." The Walsall an
archists declafe'd that their bombs were manufactured
for use in Russia. Martial Bourdin met his death not
in trying to blow up Greenwich Hospital, but in try
ing to get rid of a dangerous explosive. The attack
on the Prince of Wales by Sipido was strongly con
demned. Consequently the . statement that the as
sassination of the King of Italy was made with the as
sent of the 'London committee' is absolutely ridicti
lousl There is no such body."
This distinction between assassination in Great
Britain and assassination abroad is too delicate and
subtle to last long. Men who approve the killing of
foreign rulers will not long be averse to killing their
own. Up to this time the British anarchist may be a
very mild mannered man, but all the same it will pay
the Government to crush him and all his kind before
the inevitable development "of his ideas renders him as
dangerous to society as are the anarchists of Russia.

Â£Z^ROM Bryan's speeches the Boston Advertiser
j has compiled a- number of statements as to what
would be the condition of the trade, the indus
tries and the general affairs of the people at this
time had Bryan's predictions of 1896 proven true.
They make interesting reading, for they not only re
call to the public the character of the canvass the boy
orator made four years ago, but they show how in
competent he is to pass judgment upon economic
or political tendencies. They are therefore timely and
pertinent to the campaign of this year, for they re
veal how little confidence can be placed upon the
doctrines and predictions of the free silver champion.
In the course of his speeches Bryan said the estab
lishment 01 the gold standard would increase the pur
chasing power of the dollar; that prices would fall
as certainly as a stone falls when it is thrown in the
air; that the debts of the people would increase and
the ability of the people to pay them would lessen;
that times would become harder and harder; that
everybody would suffer except the money-changers
and money-lenders; that bread which one man earns
would be transferred to another who had not earned
it; that the rich would become richer and the poor
poorer; that it would decrease the number of the pros
perous and increase the number of the miserable;
that it would diminish the volume of standard money,
the opportunities for labor and the wages of working
men, and that it would discourage thrift, enterprise,
industry and all the forces that tend to the prosperity
of the people.
Such are some of the many predictions of the
prophet of free silver. How far they are from de
scribing the conditions of the country to-day all the
world knows. Never before were there so many op-
portunities for labor, never was enterprise more ac
tive, work more abundant or wages better. In all
parts of the Union and in all lines of industry times
have improved steadily ever since McKinley was
elected. Money circulates freely, mortgages have been
paid off and new shops, stores, factories and homes
are being erected. In brief, the things Bryan declared
ivould happen have not happened, but the things he
declared would not happen are the things that have
come to pass.
The fplendid results of the industries of the people
carried on upon the firm foundation, of the xjold stan
dard and under the influence of a comprehensive sys
tem of protection are shown deadly in the foreign
trade of the country during the past year. Accord
ing to recently published statistics of the Treasury
Department the total value of imports and exports
for the year ending June 30 exceeds for the first time
in our history the sum of $2,000,000,000. The year's
trade shows an increase of ?3io,-2Q.25o over that of
any preceding year; was more widely distributed ovor
the globe than ever before, and the export of manu
factured articles shows the same astonishing and
gratifying rate of increase as in the past few years.
The total imports amounted to $849,714,670, while the
export? were valued at $1,394,186,371. of which the
manufactures amounted to $432,284,366, against $339.
675.558 in the preceding year. The total exports of
the past year, amounting to $1,394,186,371, were fot:r
times as great as the exports of i860, which amounted
to $333,000,000, while the exports of manufactures
were more than ten times as large as the exports of
manufactured articles in i860, which amounted to
but $40,000,000.
The vast increase in the exports of manufactured
goods shows how beneficial has been that protective
system which enabled us to build up our manufac
turing industry; and, as they have been paid for in
gold or on the gold basis, it will be seen how mucb
we have profited by rejecting Bryan's policy that
would have made silver the standard of our currency.
Mr. Bryan is making another campaign of
prophecy. He is as prolific of predictions now as he
was four years ago. Perhaps some people will still
believe in him, but the vast majority will not. They
have heard him prophesy before.

THE TRIUMPH OF OUR WINES
RELIC PAID FOB IN HTJMAN LIVES.
The Call dops not hold Itseli responsible tor j
the opinions published in thla column, but
pree^r.ts them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest.
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: In your is
sue of August 4 I read Mr. William II.
Mills' letter about our California wines
at the Paris Exposition.
That subject may be readable, but to j
a great many people not thoroughly con- j
versant with wine and its nature may i
add a second black eye to the first not
thankfully received and yet sorely felt.
The French commissioners on award*
have refused to accept our wines because i
they were exhibited under French labels ;
and' names similar to those of France, |
pli upon the complaint of a wine grower j
from Burgundy, France. I declare that j
it is only a subterfuge to exclude the best
of our brands of wines by petty jealousy j
dictated by the French awards commi?- j
sioncrs. :
The California wines shipped to the
French Exposition were not entered as ,
â¢â¢French wines" and were not imitation
or falsification of them. They were not
under French labels. A French .label.-
c O called, is a square piece of paper with
the name of the wine contained in the
bottle to which it is attached; the label
also bears the place of production, the
name of the grower and his address.
Our labels (Califorriian-American la
bels) are likewise a piece of paper ami
have a similar inscription on them, ine
"address" stumps the French label to be
French, and our labels, with the address
! on them also stamp our wines to be
American; therefore they arc not at
tempts at imitation or counterfeiting the
products of other countries. .
If our wines were to be placed in com
petition against the world (and they were
Â£ent for that purpose) how could our
prrowvrs do otherwise than calling, say,
"Burgundy," a wine made from a."Pinot
grape"? if the exhibitor called that wine
"red wins from Pinot grape" he would
juÂ«t as well have been disqualified to com
pete as If he had ured the name of the
vine made out of the Burgundy grape.
But his label carries his name and address
and the name "California" Just as the
French grower's label carries the origin
i of the French wine.
The California wine growers were so
certain that their wines were goon tnat
they bolilly and justly entered them in
competition and without fear against any
'.vine of the same name, whether it was
French or Chinese. The California wine
grower knows he is now in the first line
with hi* wine, and therefore does not
have the least desire to be unfair.
The act of rffusir.fr to consider our
wines for award cannot be regarded but
as a fear that the wines would have car
r'ed the high colors, and therefore brought
a less value upon the French wines ami
the trade thereof. The impetus such glory
would have given to our wines was also
to be feared, so any pretext was pood to
erase our name "in full" from the lift of
wines and ignore California as a wine
raising country, of the most remarkable
merit.
"We sent wines to the Paris Exposition
cure wines, made out of pure, true grape
and with the names of the wines those
grapes are cultivated for. Our soil is su
perb, rich and essentially adapted to viti
culture; our climate is better fitted for
v-.-ir.f-srowir.gr than any soil in the world,
France included. When I say pure wine,
I mean that to ferment our wine we have
not to buy sugar from the refinery to add
to the '"must" to obtain a regular fer
mentation and alcoholic strength. To our
soil we need not yearly spend a fortune
in manure to obtain one or two tons of
crapes per acre. Our wines need no addi
tional spirit and doctoring to make them
salable abroad; those of Europe are gen
erally treated bffore they are exported.
We don't imitate France, nor any coun
trv and we do not need to; but we make
wine out of Imported French cuttings or
French stock. I do not see why we should
change the name of the produce such
Grapes insure us.
The French Commissioners had the
right to order us out of the competition,
but they should have warned us about the
labels in their invitation. The idea of
them sending us an invitation to nrins
over our wines and then allowing then,
to be entered, tasted and finally to find a
clerical disqualification and no way to pass
over it except to honor their own is a fact
the world will, we hope, investigate. Our
wines will new have to be sold upon their
own merit, and "merit" i3 always the best
award, because it carries the world to en
thusiasm, and our wines will surely re
ceive the world's recognition.

Warren B. Josselyn Arrested for Ob
taining Money From a Girl by
False Pretenses.
Warren B. Josselyn, an attorney from
Santa Cruz, is accused of trifling with the
affections of Nina Cadoman, a hard-work
ing girl, and obtaining from her $250 by
false representations. The girl used to
live at 427 O'Farrell street, but is now
employed at 2111 Pine street.
Josselyn was arrested about a week ago
on complaint of' the girl. He was
accused of stealing her sliver watch
on January 23 last and pawning
It. The case was called before Judge Ca
banlss yesterday afternoon, but was not
concluded, and will be heard again to-day.
After the girl had given her evidence she
swore, to a complaint charging Josselyn
with a felony in obtaining the $250 from
her by false pretenses. Josselyn had left
the courtroom before the complaint was
sworn to, but he was overhauled on Mc-
Allister street by Detectives Dillon and
McMahon and was locked up in the City
Prison.
The girl said she was Introduced to Jos
selyn about a year ago in this city by a
lady friend. He often visited her and daz
zled her with the tale that he owned land
in Santa Cruz and Fresno counties and
was an unmarried man. Finally, onf the
premise that he would marry her, she
says, she gave him the money to, as he
said, pay oft the taxes on his land, and
holds jiis notes for the amount. They had
not kept company since last January.
She now alleges that Josselyn has a wife
and four children in Santa Cruz, and is
not the owner of any land either in Santa
Cruz or Fresno County. .
Josselyn gives a general denial to the
girl's allegations, and says he did some
business for her for which he was paid.
Josselyn has been a practicing attorney
In Santa Cruz for about eight years and Is
at present a member of the law firm of.
Josselyn & Houch. He was a candidate I
for District Attorney last election on the
middle-of-the-road Populist ticket. He
has a wife and family in Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ ATTORNEY
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
GENERAL. JOHN HEUSTON JR.,
one of the most prominent mining
engineers of California, a. pioneer
of this State and for many years
identified with many of the great mining
interests of the Pacific Coast, died sud
denly yesterday afternoon of heart dis
ease at his ranch near Mills College. His
death takes away one of the principal
actors In the early development of Califor
nia. For years his activities were devoted
to various branches of mining, his fir?t
essay into that field having been in the
early '50's, when, shortly after his arrival
in San Francisco, he founded the firm of
Kellpgg. Heuston & Co., mining engineers,
assTd'ersand refiners. i^.T^'7-
Qtneral Heuston was born in Philadel
phia seventy-flve'years ago. At the age of
28 years in 1S53. he was sent to San t ran
cisco by the United States Government to
superintend the construction and installa
tion of the first United States Mint built
in the Golden State. After that work had
been completed General Heuston devoted
his attention to private enterprises, and
both as an owner and an engineer of min
ing properties he became eminent. He was
active In the work of the second vigilance
committee, which in 1856 rid San Fran
cisco of Its disreputabl.3 element. He was
at one time brigadier general, command
ing the old Second Brigade, N. G. C, and
several years ago was a leader in Repub
lican State politics. As a clubman his
name Is on the charter roll of the Bohe
mian Club and he was one of the early
members of the Union League.
Several years ago General Heuston was
attacked by heart trouble, which com
pelled him to retire from active business
affairs. Since that time he had lived
quietly in retirement at his country place,
where he died. He had been for a year
under -the care of Dr. J. H. Todd of Oak
land. A wife and four children survive
him. The latter are John E. Heuston, E.
V. H. Heuston, Anna Kills Heuston and

murder of Edjrar R. Krpner on February
IS last war continued before Judge L*w
lor yesterday. The story of Adams' flight
softer 'the commission of the crime was
told in detail by Mrs. Kepner and Con
ductor Watson, on whose train Adams
Bought to make his escape.
Mrs. Krpner testified that shortly after

Mary Berres, a Middle-Aged
Woman, Commits Suicide.
Mary Perres, a middle-aged woman,
while despondent last night, swallowed a
dose of carbolic acid and died a short
time afterward In the Receiving Hospital.
The deed was committed in a room in a
lodging-house at 23S Fourth street.
Some time ago Mrs. Perres left her hus
band and went to live with Alfred Gross,
a saloon-keeper. Yesterday morning
Gross, it Is claimed, struck her, after ac
cusing her of being too friendly- with
other men. Determined to separate from
him Mrs. Perres visited the City Hall
and endeavored to obtain a search war
rant for the recovery of her clothes, which
she claimed were being unlawfully held
by Gross. Warrant Clerk Peery, after
listening to her story, refused to issue
a warrant, but gave her a note to Gross,
informing him that unless he allowed her
to take her clothing he would be arrested
and punished.
Mre. Perres delivered the note, but was
unable to get her clothing. After brood
ing over her troubles the unfortunate
voman went to a drug* store in the vicin
ity and purchased a two-ounce phial of
carbolic acid. She then returned to her
room and swallowed the contents. Her
groans attracted the attention of Gross,
who, suspecting something wrong, has
tened to her room and found the woman
lying on the floor In a semi-unconscious
condition. He at once summoned Police
man McCormaek. who had the woman
transferred to the Receiving Hospital.
The husband of the woman is at present
living at Santa Cruz.

with the aid of a stomach pump. The
woman refused to tell why she tried to
kill herself, except to say that she had
been disappointed in love -and wanted to

and in whatever he did he showed a mas

venturesome four who, with Huntington
at their head, connected the East with
the West by the two narrow threads of
steel which afterward developed into the
great Central Pacific system. This gen
eration, he said, has not elsewhere pro
duced such a company as that four who
spanned the continent.
Following Dr. Mackenzie's address was
the hymn, "Jerusalem, the Golden," by
the quartet, a prayer by the .Rev. D.
Woods, the hymn "Abide With Me," and
the chant "Thy Will Be Done" by the
quartet, a benediction by the Right Rev.

In Memory of the Magnate.
Special Disratch to The Call.
"DEL MONTE, Aug. 17.â At 10:30 this
morning Bennett's band gave a sacred
concert in memory of the dead railroad
magnate, Collis P. Huntington, which was
listened to by a large number of the hotel
guests.
Dr. Mackenzie's address was not a eu
logy of the deceased, nor was it a life
history. It was more an analysis of the
character of C. P. Huntington and of his
effect upon his time.
C. P. Huntington, said Dr. Mackenzie,
stood in the front rank of the generals of
Industry. He was a man of indomitable
dued air of mourning and the sounds of
solemn voice and music, but there were
no black draperies and where under other
circumstances they might have hung in
heavy folds ferns and flowers brightened
the church and the doorways.
The church was opened at half-past 10
o'clock. In ten minutes the seats had
been filled and before the services opened
people were standing around the walls. It
was just 11 o'clock when the organ started
a funeral march and Dr. Mackenzie and
the clergymen assisting him stepped upon
the platform. Then "Our Days Are as a
Shadow" was sung by the double quartet,
and Dr. Voorsanger followed with the. In
vocation. A hymn, "My Faith Looks Up
to Thee," was then givqn, and Rev. Dr.
William Guthrie read some passages from
the Scriptures. Then followed "Jesus,
Lover of My Soul," by the quartet, a
prayer by Rev. Dr. Hudson Miller, a
chant, the One Hundred and Twenty
eighth Psalm, "Blessed Are They Who
Fear the Lord," by the quartet, and the
address by Rev. Dr. Mackenzie.
It was the desire of the officials in
charge of the services to rob them of all
gloom, and in this they succeeded. There
was all the respectful silence, the sub-
All that could be done to honor the

pany yesterday, who had assembled
at the First Presbyterian Church, cor
ner of Van Ness avenue and Sac
ramento street, and with them at the
services they held were many who knew
C. P. Huntington or were bound to him
by ties commercial or social. They lis
tened to the remarks upon his life by the
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie, they bowed their
heads in the prayers that were offered for
his soul, and as the hymns and anthems
filled the church they sent their thoughts
back to the East, where in fact and in
mournful state the body of the dead man
was being laid away.

1146 Market Street.Acting under direct orders from Wash
ington, the greatest secrecy was main
tained concerning the men. Nobody was
permitted to enter the barge pflice to-day
except an official. For the ilrst time in
the history of the building newspaper re
porters were excluded. All inquiries
concerning the Italians were met by
equivocations. The very mention of.
"anarchist" seemed to cause the officials
nervousness and great alarm. The men
had been taken to a special room and
there a watch has been constantly kept
over them. They are now under charge
of the Immigration officials.
When the Kaiser Wilhelm reached
Quarantine a cable message was brought
aboard. It was sent from Rome anu
asked the commander of the vessel to de
tain Natoli Moresca. Shortly after that
Chief Hazen of the New York branch of
the secret I service boarded the vessel
and made a thorough scrutiny of the pas
sengers. Hazen and his agents had a
partial description of Moresca and they
placed him under arrest when the oppor
tunity offered. Michael Guido, believed to
be an accomplice of Moresca. was also ar
rested. The men professed to be total
strangers to each other.
Officers of the steamer said to-night
that the secret service agents seemed
to be much excited over the capture.
Upon the arrival of the steamer the
men were handcuffed and under guard of
secret service agents taken to the barge
office at the liattery. The technical
charge made against one of the men was
that no was a lormer convict and as such
could not be admitted to the United
States.

"Judge Humphreys has aMowed his per
pnnal prejudice? to color his utterances.
If he likes to prostitute h'.s ermine and
drat it in the filth of a political cesspool
it is rot the fault of any one but himself.
but one may fe<?l sorrow for brilliant tal
rv.ts so hopelessly astray. â¢ â¢ â¢ Even
the native Hawaiian, who takes not too
much notice of our lejral matters, talks
of Judjre Humphreys an<i his court hÂ«s foi

Humphreys has been the means of stirring
vp f-uch comments from the Republican

The y. C. Advertiser. L. A. Thurston's
organ, writes:
â¢â¢His arbitrary treatment of suitors by
dismissing thoir cases entirely because the
attorneys wire not on hand at the drop
of the hat is not justice but the height of
injustice.
"Furnishing Fonpatlons. harrying attor
neys, fining court attendants for contempt
and ipnorinpr lonp-establifhed rules of pro
cedure, have not heretofore been found
necessary to the orderly progress of jus
tice !n Hawaii, nor is it what Judge Hum
phreya is being paid for."
The more oosservstfre Star says:
The Territorial Government having
shown scant courtesy to Judge EsteÂ© ln
the allotment of quarters for his court and
officers, he. with the consent of the Cir
sult Judges, formally ousted one of the
Judges and took possession of one of the
courtrooms. While it was a sensation, the
tar supports Judge Estee in his endeavor
to ttax-h the Dole government that the
Territory of Hawaii is no longer an inde
lÂ».*ndent sovereignty. It should be said
that Governor Dole had retired to Hawaii
before the friendly clash happened. In
all his actions Judge Kstee Is as quiet,
gentlemanly and determined and as cour

HONOLULU. Aug. 10.â The British bark
I>ut:reggan preferred to land on the reefs
near Diamond Head instead of coming
into the harbor. She, without going into
details, grounded at the same place where
the Gainsborough, now the Diamond
Head, went ashore. It was fortunate that
the Â£preckÂ«?ls tug Fearless was in port
and that plucky Captain Brockaw, al
though unprepared, rushed to the rescue
and stuck to the vessel until she was
towed into Honolulu harbor. The Iroquoia
arid Elen assisted, but It was the Fearless
that did the work and earned tome
?.uy S^j.OOO. but that Is a matter of arbitra
tion. It was a daring and splendid piece
of ecamanship, courage and trust in a
vessel. The Fearless is the heroine of the
hour.

Secret Cutting Indulged in to Secure
Government Contracts.
CHICAGO, Aug. 17.â Transcontinental
rates . have gone to smash over Govern

roads have discovered that Indiscrimin
ate rate cutting has been done. in. order
to get contracts for carrying Govern
ment-supplies to San Francisco, where
they are put aboard transports bound for
China or the Philippine?. MW|HWp4flH
The greatest rate cutting has been
made in attempts to get the meat ship
ments from Chicago. It was asserted to
day Â¦ that secret rate cutting had greatly
diminished, if not completely obliterated,
profits. In railroad circles the danger 'of
the freight war thus . started becoming
general among transcontinental roads is

PITTSB1JRG, Aug. 17.â The Post to

tion of pig metal in this country is being
secured by the Carnegie Company. It Is
seeking to buy all the big blast furnace

sentatives now have negotiations pending
for the purchase of the plants of Hav
erly & Co. at Buffalo, the Newburg fur
naces at Cleveland, a plant at Carondolet,
near St. Louis, and two others in the Ma

negie Company has contracted f<y" 16,000,
(K)0 tons of iron ore annually, when 6,000,000
will amply supply its present plants, is
taken as an indication that It expects to
acquire other plants of sufficient capacity
to use the remaining tonnage. With its
facilities for getting ore and the posses
sion of blast furnaces of enough capacity
to turn atl its ore Into pig Â¦ metal ft will

To the east there is a big blaze on the
Black Mesa, to the north huge volumes
of smoke go up from the Grand Mesa, and
tho Uncompahgre Plateau to the west Is
ablaze in three different places. Thou
sands of acres of valuable timber have
been destroyed and unless rains eet in

DENVER, Aug. 17.-A special to the
Times from Del Norte, Colo., says:
Heavy timber fires are raging south and
west of .Del Norte from the Mead of the
South Fork of Â¦ thei Rio Grande to the
head of the Conejos River. The damage
is the greatest in the history of the
country. There is almost< conclusive evi
dence that these fires are being Intention
ally set and the general impression pre
vails that this section Is entitled to a
State flre patrol at once. No rain is fall
ing and the fire has unlimited sway across
nearly fifty miles of country.
BRECKENRIDGE, Colo., Aug.y 17.â A

Pine Cottage, one of the large boaxdinjj
houses of the island, was burned to the

ance.
Fired by Incendiaries.
PEORIA, 111., Aug. 17.-Smlthfleld. a
town of 15U0 Inhabitants, forty-three miles
west of here, was visited last night by
a. very disastrous fire, which threatened
for a time to entirely destroy the place.
As It was. a dozen buildings were burned
and the loss, it is estimated, will aggre
gate $5O,0uO to *75,000. The village has no
lire department. The citizens, with gar
den hose and buckets, did what they
could to get water on the fire. Their
efforts, however, were of no avail, and
the tire burned until it had consumed tlie
entire business block.
The lire was of incendiary origin, the
match having been applied by men who
afterward tried to rob the homes of the
villagers. They were discovered in two or
three houses, but escaped. They ; left
town in a wagon, driving rapidly away.

Of these houses the Cralgie mansion, as
Colonel Higginson notes in his delightful
book on "Old Cambridge" (which the

anything I can write on the subject), is

years ago; and though thl3, as he adds,
"might be partly due to associations with
"Washington." yet he la "confident that
these made but a small portion of the
whole interest in the abode." I am sura
that the colonel is right. In the course
of the thirty-eight years I have lived in
Cambridge I have been asked by hun
dreds of frtend3 and strangers to direct
them to "Longfellow's house." and It
was, evident that It was chiefly for his
connection with it 'that they wanted to
see it. That Washington had occupied
it for more than a year was a minor con
sideration, and perhaps due less to their
interest In history than to what Longfel
low had written about it in his verses
"To a Child":

Longfellow has also been the laureate
of Cambridge and. like Lowell anil
Holmes, has helped to add a poetic in

well as to some which otherwise would
have attracted the notice of the resident

or lived and died in old colonial houses,
more or less famous for their historic as-,

tent than history in making them "pil

Longfellow lived forty-rlve years, is noted
as having been the headquarters ot
Washington when the Revolutionary
army was encamped in Cambridge. Elm

his abdication and the confiscation of the
estate by the colonial authorities. The

XIL
Three of the. most notable American
poets â Longfellow, Lowell and Holmes â
were either born In Cambridge or spent
the greater part of their lives there.
Longfellow, though born (1S07) in Maine,
when that State was a part of Massa
chusetts, lived here for forty-six of his
seventy-five years, and died at Cralgie
House in 1882. Lowell was born here in
1819, and lived at Elmwood until his death
in ISM, except during his diplomatic ser
vice in Spain and England and a few
briefer absences hardly worth mentioning.
Holmes, born In 1S03 in the "gambrel
roofed house" hard by the colleges, spent
the first twenty-four years 4>t his life
here, and most of the remainder in Bos
ton, a commercial suburb of the collegiate
town, but he is none the less to be rankeil
with Longfellow and Lowell as eminently
a Cambridge poet. His ardent love for
his birthplace and his alma mater, his
professorship in the Harvard medical
School and his intimacy with Longfellow
and Lowell and the local group of literary
men â a great constellation of which they
were only the bright particular stars â
made him a frequent visitor to Cam
bridge. From 1S58 until his death in ISM,
his Boston home was on the banks of the
Charles River, in sight of his native town;
at first Jn Charles street, and when that
became a noisy thoroughfare, in Beacon
street.
Longfellow was one of the most gentle
and most genial of men, courteous and af
fable to all who met him. but intimate
ly known only to a "charmed circle" oi
fortunate friends. Holmea said of him in
a letter to Motley in 1S73:
I find a singular charm In the society of
Longfellowâ a coft voice, a sweet and cheerful
temper, a receptive rather than an aggressive
intelligence, the agreeable flavor of scholarship
Â¦without any pedantic ways, and a perceptiblo
coupcon of humor, not enough to startle or sur
prise or keep you under the strain of over
stimulation, which I am apt to feel with very
witty people.
And ten years later, writing to a friend
and referring to his verses on the death of
Longfellow, printed in the Atlantic
Monthly, he said:
But it Is all too little, for his life waÂ» so
exceptionally sweet and musical that any voico
of praise sounds almost like a discord after It.
One might quote scores of tributes to
the beauty and charm of Longfellow a
personality, but all would be in the same
vein as those from his brother poet. It
seems to me that he describes himself In
"The Golden Legend." where Walter, the
Minnesinger, says of Prince Henry:
Ills rraclous presence upon earth
"Was as a tire upon a. hearth;
As pleasant songs, at morning sum?.
The words that dropped from his sweet tonjue
Strengthened our hearts; or heard at nUfht
Hade all our slumbers soft and light.
Such was the poet, not only to his per
sonal friends, but to the immensely wider
circle who knew him only through the
medium of print. To them he seemed no
less a personal friend, and they were rec
cgnlzed as personal friends by him. This
Is the keynote of the dedication of "The
Seaside and the Fireside," the volume
published in ISO. It Is doubtless familiar
to many of my readers, but I may be par
doned for quoting the opening stanzas:
As one who, walking In the twilight gloom.
Hears round about him voices as It darkens.
And, seeing not the forms from which they
come.
Pauses from time to time and turns and
hearkens.
Bo, walking here in twilight, o my friends,
I hear your voices, Boftened by the distance,
And pause and turn to listen as each sends
His words of friendship, comfort and as
sistance. . , ( -.-
If any thought of mine of sons or told
Has ever given delight or consolation.
Te have repaid me back a thousandfold
By every friendly sign and salutation.
Thanks for the sympathies that ye have shown!
Thanks for each kindly word, each silent
token.
That teaches me when seeming most alone
Friends ttre around us, though no word be
spoken.
Longfellow was unquestionably thÂ«
most popular of the Cambridge poets;
indeed, of all American poets, not onlv
In this country, but In Europe. All hl3
poems were early published in England
and the cheaper editions were to be found
on every bookstall. On the Continent
they were on sale In many places, to say
nothing of the many translations. On
my first visit to Europe in 1S6S, when I
was at Cologne and about to go up the
Rhine on my way to Switzerland, I re
called the allusions to the river and re
gion in "The Golden Legend" <ind wished
I had the book with me. It occurred to
me that I might possibly get a copy there
and I found a paper-covered edition of
the complete poems in the first shop I
entered. At Strasburjr I had the curi
osity to inquire for the volume and also

A TALK ABOUT LONGFELLOW BY DR. ROLFE.
LITERARY TALKS AND REMINISCENCES.
QUEEN OF ASTORIA'S
GREAT ANNUAL REGATTA
Sjocial Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Nebr., Aug. 17.-Dr. George L.
Miller, for 30 years a leader of the Demo
cratic forces In Nebraska and a founder
of the Omaha World, and for twenty-four
years its editor. 13 a most uncompromis
ing foe to BrVanlsm, "I know Bryan as
well as any one can know him," says Dr.
Miller, "for I have worked with liim in
his early political days and have been in
touch with his actions of more recent
years. 1 have no faith whatever in his
sincerity, because I credit him with more
than ordinary intelligence. He knew the
fallacy of the free-silver proposition
when he first thrust it upon the party In
this State, but he insisted upon maJting
it a political Issue, for with panther-like
quickness he realized that it could be
readily employed to delude a people who
at that time were suffering a universal
business depression.
"The primary objection to Bryan is his
continuous assault upon the established
Institutions of his country, his unremit
ting attacks upon citizens who happen to
own something:, his opposition to the
rights of our courts and his implied care
lessness as to the preservation of law and
order. He Is forever appealing to class
prejudice and endeavoring to array one
portion of our people against another. He
panders to the desires of envious, unscru.
pulous and irresponsible members of so
ciety, and for that reason alone he Is a
dangerous man to place at the head of
our Government.
"I regard Bryan as a socialistic revolu
tionist, tinged with religious fanaticism.
On the money question Bryan preaches a
false doctrine; on the subject of law and
order he incites? the revolutionary spirit;
on the Philippine problem he promises
nothing different from the course now
being pursued by the administration, but
attempts to catch votes by a groundless
cry of imperialism.
"Bryan is as Insincere in his utterances
on the Philippine question as he is in nls
silver doctrine."

Tbe Marriage Problem
" How to be happy though married," has
been entirely solved to the satisfaction
of hundreds of thousands of women.
There can be no happiness without
health. The general health of woman
is dependent on the local health of the
delicate womanly organs. When there
are debilitating drains, or inflammation,
ulceration or female weakness, happiness
in marriage is practically impossible. A
host of hr.ppy wives testify that the
secret of happiness in marriage is found
in the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-
scription. It dries the drains, heals ul-
ceration and inflammation and cores fe-
male weakness. It makes weak women
strong, sick women well.
Mrs. Anna Willy, (Michigan House), North-
rille. Spink Co., S. Dak., writes: "I am enjoy-
ing good health, thanks to your kind advice and
valuable remedies. I suffered very much with
female weakness and other ailments for more
than two years, when I wrote to you for advice.
After carefully following your advice and taking
six bottles each of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-
scription and ' Golden Medical Discovery ' I am
now a well and happy women."
Women are invited to consult Dr. Pierce
by letter, free. Correspondence private.

"Perhaps no one has suffered more
from the use of cofTee or failed oftener
in the attempt to leave it off than I
have. Although I never drank more
than hall" a cup at a time, it even then
gave me tour stomach and a whole cata-
logue of misery. This kept up for a
Jong period, and time and again I have
resolved that I positively would drink
r.o more cofTee, but alas! the rest of the
family used it, and, like the reformed i
drunkard who smells whiskey and falls j
again, when I smelled cofTee 1 could not

erage â a crisp, dark brown, rich cofTee.
with a fine pungent coffee taste, and yet
with no sour stomach or nervous trou-
bles after it. On the contrary, I have
gained gradually in strength and sturdy
health. AH who have spoken to me
about Postum agree, and we have found
it so, that the directions for making
must be followed, and it must be boiled
,at least fifteen minutes, or more, and it
clso requires the addition of good
k 'ream. We have tried boiling it a few
minutes when in a special hurry, but
found it insipid and unsatisfactory;
whereas by proper boiling it is dark and
rich, with a delightful flavor.
"Dr. McMillan of Sunbeam 111., said
h<* had rscd Postum and found it to be
just as good as coffee, and more health-
ful. He is an M. D. of fine standing.
Mr. David Strong and sister have lett
off cofTee and are using Postum. They
find it much more healthful. Rev. \V.
T. Campbell, pastor of the Second
United Presbyterian Church of this city,
says: "You may say anything good that
you wish about Postum Food Coffee
and I will substantiate it.' He was a
very prreat lover of coffee, and yet found
it very injurious to his health. He now
drinks Postum three times a day and the
old troubles have disappeared.
"I shrink from having my name ap-
pear in public. The statement I have
given you is truthful, and I hope will aid
tome "people to discover that coffee is
tbe cause of their aches and ails, and
they are in a way to pet rid of their

*m.z up Postum Food Coffee."

NEW YORK. Aug. 17.â If any expectation
had been entertained that the rescue of th?
foreigr. Ministers in China would arouse specu
lative enthusiasm Wall street's reception of
the news was disappointing. In fact the spec
ulation was more Fluggish than at any time
tbis work and the tendency until the last hour
reactionary. This proved that they event had
t-Â«Â»n fuliy <lif>eour.tÂ«Kl. There was a conflict
at the 1 penlng to determine the market's ten
df-r.cy, in which the bÂ»ars soon obtained th*
uj'per hand. In consequence there was a gen
eral .-.enir.e of prices, but in no case did the
fell reach a point in th railroad lii>t. The
mc*t effective celling was in the steel stocks.
thÂ«- Breup tiding affected by. reports of trade
conflicts and expected cuts in products. The
Important mov^mpr.tjs of the day centered In
Brooklyn Transit and Consolidated Gas. Both
Ftof-kf. after momentary weakness, started up
ward and ended with good gains. Xo definite
news accounted for the weakness in the rail
road lift, but the opinion prevailed that the
profit-ialtir.i: wae primarily respor.pibls. In the
late -i. â¢.-.;:: *s an evening up of contracts v.-as
effective in wiping out much of the day's

The bond market showed a reactionary ten
dency to-day, which is most pronounced In
irsues known as semi-ppeculatlve. Total sales,

Americans shared In this ris<\ but were not
prominent, and though London bought stocks
here it did not do so on-any extensive scale.
The Influences from abroad were, however, fa
vorable in the main and helped Wall street to
maintain a generally bullish tone.
The large gold movement to London has re- I
lieved that market. The London stock market, !
like our own, was favorably influenced by the I
successful advance of the allies toward Peking, â¢
and the further evidence that the Chinese were 'Â¦
likely to surrender the Ministers and open ne
gotiations for a settlement with the powers.
In London also there seemed to be a scarcity
of "home rails" and other favorite invest
ment stocks, and with Its financial and politi
cal fears relieved, that market had a ueneral
advance. In which Chinese bonds and other re
cently depressed issues were prominent.
The stock market failed to sell off on the
gold exports as money was not affected to any
extent and it is recoenlzed that the inGow of
specie on the Pacific Coast from local mines,
Alaskan placers and shipments from Australia
will in all probability soon restore whatever
sum of gold the Treasury of the New York
Associated Banks lose through the present ar
rangements to supply European specie require
ments.
There has been considerable more activity
from the speculative markets this week. It
did not, , however, seem due to any revival of
public Interest or participation. So far as
the latter Is concerned, it la confined largely to
investment buying: of trunk line shares and
other dividend payers. This absorption of
securities has now been in progress" so Ions
and on' such a scale that there is in somÂ« cases
a positive scarcity of stock. This gxratly limits
the ability of bearish operators to depress the
market and correspondingly facilitates any
manipulation for higher, prices.

CHICAGO, Aug. 17.â Wheat opened weak,
unchanged to Vic lower, September at 73%i?
73>Â£c. A ray of bullishness was extracted from
lighter Argentine shipments and the fact that
Liverpool fhowed less decline than there was
here yesterday. September followed the open-
Ing advance to "3%c. but failed to hold it. The
habit of liquidation had a holÂ«f on local traders
as well as on some outside people. Western
receipts were small, but the selling continued
in a dreary way, the cash demand was slack,
the pit only half filled and September gradually
dpclined to 72%c and closed ft'S'Tic under yes
terday at 72T4@73c.
Corn was quiet, but firm. Â« Kansas still had
hot weather, which the experts used as a basis
for damage claims. September closed J ,4c higher
at 89HC.
Oats were quiet and dull. September closed
Me lower at 21%Q21ftc.
Provisions were dull, with unexpected weak
ness developing in lard during the session.
Ribs, on the other hand, were rather steady.
Local 8?lling of January products was the fea
ture of the market. September pork closed
30c lower, lard 5@7}&c lower and ribs un
changed.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

New York Money Market.
London bought American shares moderately
until New York began to sell, then the market
relapsed also. Copper stocks were weak' and
demoralized on account of the last fortnight
ly statistics.
Th* bank bought Â£102.000 in bars and is send

N'EW TORK. Auf. 17.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was very slack hero to-day. This
was partly in anticipation of the holiday to
morrow, but the tone was unsettled also by the
news from South Africa that Do Wet had
escaped Kitchener, the apprehension of trou
ble to grow out of the situation at Shanghai
and the lack of any official confirmation of
the reported relief of Peking.

cases: Pusret Round. SOO.OOO; Fraser River 35*> -
000. Tho r-ack of outside British Columbia

Harrison's circular* ?ays: "During the week

Oregon, 3ft tons; total, *;.<V>3 tons. If we were
assured an equal amount weekly for some

for fear of a fuel shortage, as thl* is largely
In excess of our weekly demand. Every possi
ble cnJeavor is being m2de to get fcufflcient
ahfad to have a reserve later on for our fall
requirements ; so far we have been unsuccess
ful. Prices are firm and deliveries are beinff
taken freÂ«-!y from shin's side on arrival, leav
ins no accumulation to be yarded. The for
eign arrivals cut a very small figure in aiding
us. as the cost at original point of shipment
ad(!rd to present rate of trans-shipment, make
the figures prohibitory. Reports are cominjr
in from varied interior sections of the Increased
oil output. It is sincerity to be hoped that
these reports may be verified, as this winter we
will look to oil to prevent any fancy figures
beinc asked for other fuels during the season.
Producers of coal and oil cannot complain of
Ijrevalllnsr values for their output, as a hand
some profit Is left for them, with a positive
assurance that present prices will Drevall for
many months to come. Large shipments of
bituminous coal are renaned being made to
some of the seaports of France for railroad
uses, also to other European stations which
hfietofore drew their supplies from England."

PHOENIX, Ariz., Aug. 17.â A message
was received hero to-day telling of an
other mining war in Cananea, Sonora.
Several years ago a man named Ltnd
sey located a mine group known as the
I.indsey claims. He became involved in
a dispute with a locator named Greene
over the boundaries of the claims,
which have never been settled. Llnri
sey aold hi? claims to a syndicate,
including Senator Fairbanks and Mayor
Taggart of Indianapolis. Greene's a<V
verse claim was known to the syndicate
and a representative was sent to the City
of Mexico In the interest of the-, pur
chasers. In, tho meantime Greene . took
possession, but the syndicate procured, a
court order putting Lindscy In possession.
The Judge â¢ of the- court accompanied
Lindsey to Cananea, but an armed force
directed by â¢ Greene prevented the execu
tion of the order. A report of the affa'r
was sent to Hermosillo and' an' armed
force of eighty men left there
to assist in carrying out; the order of- tho

REDDING. Aug. 17.â To a stranger
cause than the "Kruttschultt cycle"
is attributed the freeiuent disas
ters on the Southern Pacific Rail
road in this section, resulting from
runaway freight trains. The start
ling theory is that subterranean
disturbances, jarring the earth's
surface, start the cars on their wild
runs elown the grades.
Those! who give credence to this
theory advance these puzzling
views:
Firstâ Thnt heretofore there have
been no similar eli?asteis.
Secondâ That the train men are
just as careful as ever, and have
been more so since the first train
started on its wild runaway trip.
Thirdâ That the air . and hand
brakes are sound and ' strong as
ever. .
Fourthâ That the cars .start on
their mad flight long after the
brakes have been set and the trains
have come'to a standstill.
From these premises they argue
that a sudden | upheaval of the
earth, due to a subterranean dis
turbance, must be the cause that
puts the trains In motion. They
point to the fact especially that in
the latest occurrence of this kind
several days ago the eleven cars
composing the train had been
switched on to the main line In the
Slsson yard and had been^standing
there for some time, when suddenly
the cars, began a swift run down
the' grade to Mott. Fortunately
Brakeman Brown, who was .the
only one of the crew on the cars, 1
being then in the caboose, did not
lose his presence of mind, and set
all the hand brakes. -; succeeding In
stopping, the. train' after a half-mile
run. This had been the fourth run
away 1Â» four weeks.

catch the bold highwaymen whom Het-s
describes as "one short and the other

Hess says the men ordered him to move
along, and threatened to put a bullet
through him if he turned around or made
an outcry.
Hess claims that the men ordered him
to throw up his hands, and that one of
the robbers enforced the elemanO by plac
ing a pistol at hla head. The other man
went through Hess' pockets ar.d relieved
him of a few dollars in silver and a gold
watch and chain. A pair of diamond
sleeve buttons attracted the man's atten
tion and these, too, ; were added to the
booty.
When brought before Captain Seymour
last night the man was roughly dressed
and wore a big sombrero. Fifteen dollar*
was found on his person. He is about 40
years of age.
The stage robber showed himself to be
a nervy fellow, when on one occasion
while engaged in relieving the occupants
of a stap/e of their valuables a. squad of
soldiers en route to the park aprÂ«ar->d sud
denly on the scene. Instead of" fleeing tho
robber coolly throw his gun on them an 1
lined them up with his civilian captives
until he had completed his work, when he
backed into the bushes and disappeared.
Bernard Hess reported to the Chief of
Police last evening that while on his way
home at an early hour yesterday morri
inr: he was held up and robbed by two
masked men on' Pierce street, between
Fell and Oak.
Detectives Ed Gibson and "Jack" Fitz
gerald late last night arrested the man.
who says his name Is Tom Moran. at
Baden and brought him to the City Prison,
where he was locked up in the tanks. The
police declare they are satisfied he Is tho
highwayman.
The police believe they have succeeded
in capturing a notorious stape robber, no
less a personage than the bold outlaw who
successfully held up the Yosernite stag*?
several months ago and caused shivers of
apprehension to chase up and down tho
spinal columns of tourists journeying to
the famous park for some time thereafter.
Bernard Hess Says Masked Thugs
i Believed Him of His Jewelry
and a Small Sum of
Money.

I Iroquois Club Meets.
The Iroquois Club field Its regular
â¢reckJy meetinff at Pythian Castle last
night. John Aubrey Jones addressed the
club at some length on campaign issues.
W. J. Iiaggett and Denis J. Oliver were
Mtyor Phelan Denounced.
The Bryan and Stevenson Club of the
Tlyrty-ninth Assembly District hold a
meeting last night at Saratoga Hall. In
the Interest of harmony and to insure
the success of the national ticket it was
resolved that the club sign the roll of the
"Organization" Club of the e'.inrict.
Bpeeches were made denouncing the
mrihods of the County Committee.
Charle-s Edelman attacked the political
standing eif Jame? D. Phelan. and in
string words declared that ho coi;!;l prove
that tho Mayor was a traitor to his party:
that he Had cast his vote for MeKlnley
!n IS^. and would probably do the same
at the coming flection.
In defiance of the State Central Commit
tee- the Â»>olt:ng bosses of the Kelly-Crim
r-'.ir.s Coiigressional Committee have is
tued s. call for a bogus primary to be
held en August 25 to elect delÂ«^gates to a
Convention c.Uled to assemble September
3 ard nominate candidates for the Legis
lature.
The- Mint Faloon bosses, by their action
in calling the side show, confess that they
have given ui> all hope of stuffing the bai
lot boxes at the regular primary. Poli
ticians who profess to be familiar with the
bops programme assert that it Is now the
Intention of the defeated bossesâ Kelly,
dimming. Herrln ami Dibble â to creat?
till the confusion jÂ«obsible and then appeal
to the State Central Committee to i'ntei
vene and overthrow the County Commi'
tc-e. The nineteen thousand stalwart anti
bess R< publicans who voted for Horace
Davis cr.e year agro wetU be heard when
the Stato Committee is asked to bolster
UP iiartin Kelly and Phil Crimmins.
The chairman of the Republican County
Comrr.ittte says that he has appointed
eighteen well-known members of the or-
Kanlzation to carry into effect proper
rreasures for securing an honest primary.
ThÂ« names of the men appointed were not
announced last night. In expectation of
thi- official announcement many members
of the committee wont to the headejuar
ur: ; In the- Baldwin annex.
Several district mcetinps were held last
niKht. A meeting in the Twenty-ninth
Liisirict was attended by John J. Dauph
ne'.v. John B. McN'amara. Leon Samuels,
E. H. I.mpf-rss and J. Collins. The Kelly
ard Crimmins following had th<Â» majority
boi <h<i not attempt to force matters. Paul
F^hulz. who was recently removed from
the- committee was present, presumablv
!n the interest of- Martin Kelly. A protest
against allowing him to vote was regis
t< red by John J. Daughnoy and J. B. Me-
Niimara. The EtepubUous who stand for
pood government and clean politics are
prepared to put up a formidable fight in
*!:>-â¢ stronghold of the- bosses.
The merchants and taxpayers of the
Torty-thlrd Assembly District will bo
prsiUic-d to hear that Henry Stern the
newly appointed county committeoman of
t_ri<- district, is easting his influence in
favor of a clean primary and the- selection
rf reputable citizens to act as election of
ficers.
It is understood that affairs have* b<*cn
harmoniously adjusted in the* Thirty-ninth
District and that pood men will guard the
election on the inside.
CT~r.cn tho intelligence reached the camp
of the bosses recently that the Republican
County Committee had determined to
adopt effective measures to prevent re
peating and ballot-box stuffing at the pri
mary Kelly ajid Crimmins rounded up the
Fourth Congressional District Committee
ar.d threatened to disrupt the party in
fan Francisco.
So Ions as the bosses fancied that they
could fill every polling place with judges,
inspectors and clerks of their own selec
tion they were ready to respond to the
requirements cf the State Central Com
mittee. When they realized that the
County Committee, after mature deliber
ation, had decided to eive the honest vot
ers recognition the Mint saloon bosses
bolted and issued a call for the nomina
tion of Skaters and As^mblymen by a
convention created to nominate *&. candi
date for Congress.
This conduct upon the part of the bolt
ers signifies that the agents of the South
ern Pacific are ready to resort to the
most desperate measures in order to gain
control 01 the next Legislature. The Cail
on more than oac occasion has advised
Republican citizens that Martin Kelly
would knife the national ticket in the in-
T err tt of Democratic bosses as readily
as he knifed M. hi. Estee, the Republican
n< Dlnee for 'jnvornor, and Horace Davis,
the Republican nominee for Mayor. This
fact may be ubvious now to the Stat-? Cen
tral Committee. In the official call for the
State Convention sigrneii bv Oeorge Stone
ar.d William M. Cutter the following par-
Bgnph is found:
Th.u said ?tate ocnvontion shall consist of
C-2 de!*-icatÂ«-Â»., f.nd a;l of said Â«lelejrates mÂ«;t bÂ«

EARLY CALIFORNIA SPORTS
To Be Revived at the Old Capital.
The great annual event for Monterey
has been fixed for Sunday, September 2.
For several years past the custom has
been observed of having a big day in the
historic old capital, devoted exclusively
to the sports and festivities of old Span
ish origin, which were bo famous there
half a century ago and before. This year
the event will be more enthusiastically
observed than ever, there being: a strong
sentiment in favor of reviving and per
petuating those romantic scenes. The
picturesque and really wonderful feats
of lassoing and riding wild horses and
steers, riding broncos bareback, snatch
ing coins from the ground while riding
at breackneck speed, and all sorts of
daring and apparently impossible feats
on the backs of wild animals, if not ex
actly novel, will at least be very interest-
Ing and exciting exhibitions. ,
Del Monte and Pacific Grove will, of
course, share the interest of this occa
sion.
Round-trip tickets will be sold for $2,
a third less than half fare and a sum so
small that all can afford to go. The train
will leave Third and Townsend streets
at 8 a. m. and give excursionists five
hours at the places named. William H.
Menton. the Espee's excursion passenger
agent, will be in command.

.The Roajioke, the largest American
Balling vessel afloat, arrived from Balti
more yesterday with 4900 tens of coal. She
had a very hard time of it rounding the,
Horn, being driven back twice by adverse
winds. Captain Amesbury in his report
says:
"Passed Staten Island on May 17. Thence
to Cape Horn light, variable winds. The
distance is only 250 miles, but It took us
twenty days to cover it. Then we ran into
a succession of gales, accompanied by
snow, sleet and Ice, and time and again
we had to pour boiling water on the
blocks to keep the running gear working.
Twice we were driven back and once I
thought we were going to reach the South
Pole, We were thirty-four days getting
from 50 in the Atlantic to W in tne Pacific.
"Once we got into tho Pacific we had
fair weather until 16 north. 12l> west, was
reached. There we ran into a storm that
lasted three days. It blew with hurricane
force and was accompanied by a heavy
cross sea. The 6hip rode It well and once
that storm was over we were not both
ered again except by fog until San Fran
cisco was reached."
The Roanoke is 3347 tons net burden and
is the largest wooden ship afloat and the
largest sailing vessel In the merchant
marine. She is larger than the Shenan
doah and over 600 tons greater capacity
than the Erskine M. Phelps, which ar
rived from Honolulu last Thursday.

Roderick Dhu Arrives.
The bark Roderick Dhu arrived from
Hilo yesterday after a fair run of twenty
five days. Captain Johnson has on several
occasions made the same trip In ten and
eleven days, but on this occasion light
winds and calms played havoc with h's
calculations. The barks Amy Turner and
Olympic left the. Islands the same day as
the Roderick Dhu. Neither of them has
been heard from yet, so that Is Â»o:ne
small satisfaction to the master of the
Roderick Dhu.
The Roderick Dhu brought up twenty
cabin passengers. Among them was J. D.

FIRST CONTRACT WITH
THE CITY CERTIFIED TO
Mrs. Rebecca Anderson has brought suit
for divorce against Captain Robert W.
Anderson, for live months past sergeant
at-arm's of the Board of Supervisors and
for inar.y years prior to that time a well
known shipmaster. The complaint was
iiled and summons issued yesterday morn
lng. jucge Ba_hrs. on petition of plain
tin*, issued a restraining order to prevent
the defendant from disposing of any
money or property he may have in order
to escape payment of ullmony.
Two causes, for divorce are allegedâ
adultery and cruelty. Captain Anderson
is 63 years old and his wife is 57. They
were married in Pa.rtea, New Zealand, on
November 14, Ib67. They have live chil
drenâa daughter and four sons, all grown.
Captain Anderson asserts his innocence
of the offenses alleged itnd says that he
will enter a general denial as soon as he
can er.giige a lawyer and have an answer
to the complaint liled.
The Andersons ilve at 70S Douglass
street, near the intersection of Castro and
Twenty-third. The co-respondent named
in tne complaint is Mrs. Al.ee Weidemhal,
wife o: Samuel ii. Weldentiial, sin elec
trician, residing at TlnJ Klizabetli street.
The Weidc-nthals live within half a block
of the Andersons. Mrs. \\ eidenthal is a
young: woman about 2\i years old and the
mother of two children. Captain Ander
son says that but ior the injustice done
her in the complaint he would not opposa
his wife's suit.
The plaintiff alleges that the defendant
commiued a. similar offense with a.
â¢"woman known as Wallie; also with one
known as Jennie; also with one known as
ilrs. Osborne, and with divers others
v. nose names are unknown to plaintiff."
She alleges that during tne past eleven
months the defendant has visited Mrs.
\\>Menthal every morning about 8 o'clock
after her husband had gone to his work,
iind has remained with her two or three
hours axid sometimes longer. Also that he
has. of ten received love letters from her,
lilled with endearing terms, and not only
from her but from "divers other women."
For fUTtht r srd separate cause for ac
tion the piaintiff alleges that since their
marriage defendant has treated her in a
cruel aad Inhuman manner; that within
the paFt two years, except between Aug
ust Â». 1R35>. and June ~j. 1>Â», when plaintiff
was at-sent in New Zealand, defendant
has almost daily applied vile and vulgar
names and epithets to her, ordering her
to leave the house and saying that he did
not care for her and did not want to live
with her. She alleges further that on July
2S of this year he assaulted her with his
clenched fist and threatened to kill her.
also that for two years he has refused to
let her children or her relatives visit her.
The family troubles of the Andersons t>e
pan to culminate two y*ars aero, when the
captain quit going to sea. He had been
a. shipmaster continuously during the
twomy-six years of their residence in San
Francisco, his last vessel being the Fteam
t Empire, plying between this port and
Portland. After nearly a year of stormy
wr-ather ashore Captain Anderson sought
fair weather at Honolulu. While he was
pone, on AugiiFt 9 of la-st year, his wife
went to New Zealand to visit her mother,
whom she brought back with her on June
Â£3 of this year â the day on which plaintiff
all<"-pps defendant struck hÂ»r with his
clfnched fist. Captain Anderson returned
from Honolulu in September of last year,
and according to the allegations of his
wife has since that time been one of the
payesl old beaux In this seaport town.
The plaintiff prays that she be granted
a divorce; that a rest raining order be is
eued to Prevent defendant from disposing
of his property or his monthly salary of
1100; that he be ordered to vacate the res;-*
dence at 70s Douglass street and restrainr-d
from interfering with the peace of the
plaintiff, and that alimony and a reason
able sum for lets and costs be awarded
her.
Captain Anderson says that his wife has
b^en misled by jealous persons, whom he
intimates are momhers of thtir own fam
ily. He pays â¢-â¢Wailie" and "Jennie" and
"Mrs. Ofborao" are absurd fictions and
that Mrs. Weidcr.thal is innocent of any
wrong. He has known her and her hus
1-smd for years, as he has known every
one in the neighborhood, and to protect
lier grood name he will figtit his wife's
eult. He characterizes the charges of
cruelty as absurd.

by His Wife.

SEEKS DIVORCE
FROM MAN SHE
THINKS TOO GAY
The dissension between the planing mill
owners and the employes is Hearing a
crisis.
"'Unices there is a prompt settlement of
this question on the part of the mill-own
ers the council will precipitate a general
strike affecting the entire building indus
try of San Francisco," said J. J. Williams,
secretary of the mlllinen's union and a
member of the Building Trades Council,
last evening. "Such action would throw
10.01*0 men out of employment and would
create a suspension of building activity
the like of which has never been seen
here. The council would regret exceed
ingly to be forced to take this step, but
such a course will be inevitable unless the
mill-owners see lit to accept our proposi
tion."
The different organizations that would
be affected should a general strike be or
dered are the amalgamated wood-workers,
cement workers, carpenters (four unions
with a total strength of 2500). the stair
builders, painters, paper-hangers and dec
orators, varnishcrs and polishers, sign
writers and pictorial painters, bricklay
ers. hoGcarriers, cornice-makers, sheet
metal workers, metal roofers, derrick men
and engineers, grate and tile setters, mar
ble cutters and finishers, stone cutters,
glaziers, plumbers, gas and steam fitters
and electricians.
The executive committee of the trades
council held a short meeting- last even
ing; and discussed the situation, and then
most of the members went to Oakland to
attend a general meeting of the council
there. The mill-owners are to meet this
evening, and the operatives hope that a
plan of action will be agreed upon which
they can indorse.
That the mill-owners are not weaken
ing, in spite of published reports to tne
contrary, is apparent from the following
statement made by Andrew Wilkie, chair
man of the press committee of the Mill
men's Association, last evening:
The bulldlnc trade? representative has fre
quently Etateil in the columns of the local press
that the n-.ill-owners are weakening; that mills
are withdrawing from their organization and
conceding the union demands, and seeking a
compromise, etc. etc.
These statements are entirely erroneous and
if continued will result in great injury to the
business interests of the city and State.
As a. matter of fact, the mill-owners are not
weakening, but on the contrary are well organ
ized and determined to maintain their present
stand to the last. The few mill." now running
on the eight-hour schedule are small concerns
and their actions cannot to any extent influ
ence the general result.
The SearleF-Hayman Company has three
working proprietors and one employe. R.
IVwey's force consists of himself and two men.
Le Gal k Ostrander one proprietor and three,
men. The Mission Planing Mills has two part
m-rs= and one man. The Uumboldt Lumber
Company has three men, including the engi
neer. McManus & Gardner have two proprie
tors and two men. The Zenith Mill has two
proprietors and eix men. while Veitch Bros.,
who have a jrreat deaJ of their work from the
Kast, have always worked eight hours.
The foregoing, excluding the last, have been
rr.ism>nrsented as having a total of 122 men
employed, while their entire working force con
sists of eleven employers and seventeen men.
There are many men out who have no inter
est in this movement and want to work, but
throuph ignorance of the real conditions or fear
of punishment in the event of union success re
frain from such action. Others, who have been
reluctantly forced Into Joining unions, would
pladly return to work but the came reasons.
I To all such the Mill-owners' Association offers
i employment and protection, together with the
' assurance that they have reached the limit of
endurance and will not In future tolerate the
Flightest interference from outside organiza
tions.
afDT/r.TTM REPLIES TO "WTLKIE.
He Says There Is No Need for Fear-
ing Outside Mills.
OAKIyAN'D. Aug. IT.â The mill opera
tives' fight for an eight-hour day is with
out fresh development. Neither side ef
fected any results and matters remain In
statu quo.
Alpheus Kendall of the Pacific Coast
Milling Company has been at Watsonville,
San Jose and other places seeking skilled
workmen, but without success.
In reply to the statement of Andrew
WlMcie. millowner and contractor on the
De Fremery building, to the effect that
the local mills cannot grant the request
for eight hours unless they are protected
from the competition of outside mills
â¢working longer hours, J. H. Mullen, busi
ness agent of the Building Trades Coun
cil, said to-day:
"Mr. Wilkie's fears, and those of all
other millowners in this regard, are
groundless. The Building Trades will
handle no will work from nine-hour mills,
no matter where located. We will remain
true to our principles and shall take no
unfair advantage such as that would be.
We believe in the protection of our home
mills and will protect them. They need
fear no competition from outside mills not
working on the eight-hour schedule.
"It seems to me. though," added Mr.*
Mullen, "that the millowners expect a
good deal from the unions. They want us
to assure them of protection when they

The Grand Jury Investigated the Conroy
water front scandal yesterday. As a side
issue, it listened to James Taylor Rogers
and "Young Dutchy" Handsted, or, rath
er, they listened to the former, who loos
ened up and answered a few questions.
The man from Nome remained dumb on
the advice of his attorney, Charles Pence,
and after a quarter of an hour's ques
tioning was taken back to his cell. As
his bail is not reduced, but remains at
$0000. he is likely to stay there for a while.
"I refused to talk on my attorney's ad
vice," was all "Dutchy" would vouchsafe
ill explanation of his silence.
While the returned wanderer was seat
ed in the anteroom awaiting his call,
Charles Pence arrived and the two held
a long heart-to-heart talk in a corner.
When "Dutchy" was taken back to his
cell Pence accompanied him.
When E. D. Wilbur entered the Grand
Jury room a flutter of excitement went
around the group of victims of the water
front frauds who were seated outside.
Wilbur's oxaminatiqn revealed the where
abouts of the missing notes which have
caused so much worry. Wilbur delivered
them for safe keeping into the hands of
Attorney W. S. Scott, In whose possession
they remained until yesterday, when the
attorney, having 1 been subpenaed on Wil
bur's testimony, delivered them to the
Grand Jury. Wilbur promised the Grand
Jury that he would bring witnesses be
fore them at their next session who would
swear that he gave the money paid him
to Conroy.
J. L. Ferren, one of the victims, was
then called. He said all that he knew
was that ho paid some money to Wilbui
for a' job on the water front. He under
stood that it was to go to Conroy. The
Grand Jury then adjourned. Witnesses
In the Chretien and Wilbur cases are sud
penaed for the next regular session of
the jury on Tuesday next. A special ses
sion has been called for Monday, at 7:30
]). m.
Attorney Scott, speaking of the notes
delivered to him by Wilbur, said:
"It was Just at the time of The Call's
exposure that Wilbur came to my office
and told me that he wanted me to take
care of some notes for him. I took them
and have held them ever since. At that
time Wilbur seemed very poor, hardly
hp.ving enough money to purchase medi
cines for his dying wife."
"Wilbur refused to give the names of
the witnesses to the transaction between
himself and Conroy. but says that he will
surely produce them.
