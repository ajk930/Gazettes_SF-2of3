SAN FRANCISCO. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1900.
VOLUME LXXXYIII-^O. 97.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 4.â The Republican State convention, which will meet to-morrow
in this city, will attempt no' novelty in platform building. As a matter. of public information, the committee
on platform has not been chosen. As a matter of fact the chairman, of the convention who is not yet elected,
but who will be to-morrow. Is W. C. Van Fleet of San Francisco., -With the assistance of various advisers,
he has already chosen the committee on platform, which will be announced to-morrow, and under the leader
â¢ ship of its chairman, J. W. McKinley of Los Angeles, will declare the platform which has 'been decided upon
to-night. This platform will not be muc,h more than an indorsement and reafnrmation of the platform adopted by
the National Republican party at Philadelphia. ' The. document will be- brief and, "It is expected, to the point.
The administration of President McKinley, in all Its phases, will be unequivocally indorsed. The policy of the
National Republican party In reference to the "serious international affairs which have, concerned the nation for the last
three years will be supported. '.The platform will be purposely, silent in -reference to the details of this policy and to Its
â¢various phases, as this convention deems it'best not to discuss independently the issues with which the national party
is concerned. . < Â¦ ,
The administration of State affairs under the direction of Governor Henry T. Gage will also receive the indorse
ment of the convention.' . Â¦' ... .
A strong advocacy will also be made for the construction of an Isthmian canal,* the convention- making an express
preference for the Nicaraguan route. A' specific recommendation. will also be made that the canal be absolutely under
the direction of the United States. This clause In the platform will be of exceptional importance to the people of the
Pacific Coast. . ;
California's representatives inCongress wlll.'.be directed to. use their utmost endeavors to prevent the Impending
and constantly Increasing influx of the Asiatics to this coast, and in this recommendation the convention will make no
discrimination between the Chinese and Japanese. â¢. â¢ . '
The convention will urge that California's representatives in Congress do their utmost through legislation to prevent
the importation of these Asiatic laborer's. A tribute will be. paid in the document to the soldiers* and the sailors, who
have fought in the Spanish, Phillppinee and Chinese wars. ..... . Â» * -.-.
The, platform will unequivocally' indorse the conduct of the Republican Representatives and Senators hi Congress in
their efforts to support California's interests. 'â¢ â¢ . '.
On other points than these the platform will be silent. It .will possess, the merit of .brevity. .â¢
It "Will Be "Very Strong and
"Very Brief.
HERE IS THE FORECAST
OF THE PARTY PLATFORM
tor H. Metcalf has already been nominated for Congress to represent the Third
District, James McLachlan has been nominated to represent the Sixth District,
and J. C. Needham has already received a similar honor from the electors of the
Seventh District. It Is conceded that Julius Kahn of the Fourth District and
Eugene F. Loud of the Fifth District will receive the honor of renomination.
Frank L. Coombs is certain of a nomination In the First, and the only remaining
contest Is in the Second Congressional District, in which a most peculiar contest
has arisen. . â¢
In the first place Republicans, independent of their subordination or defianc*
\
IN THE CONGRESSIONAL FIELD.
In the Concessional field the contests are somewhat more complicated. Vic-
in California. Before this convention has met the Southern Pacific has chosen the
chairman, appointed the committees, outlined the policy, dictated the compro
mises and chosen the platform for the Republican votÂ«r3 of California. The dele
gates to the convention will meet to-monow and will assume that they have the
right to act as they think. In this they will be altogether mistaken. After they
have passed the preliminary business of the session they will elect a Presidential
Electors at Large Samuel M. Shortridge of San Francisco and W. J. Barrett of Los.
Angeles. Mr. Shortridge's claim for preference Is his eloquence and his service to
the party. Upon what Mr. Barrett will base his pleadings Is something of which
the delegates to this convention are not Informed. The other Presidential Elect
ors will be chosen by the various district conventions, into which the main conven
tion will segregate.
State Senator J. X. Gillette of Humboldt will represent the First Congressional
District. It had been his hope to receive the nomination from this district for Con
gress, but United. States District Attorney Frank L. Coombs beat him out.
In the Second District Dr. G. L. Simmons will be chesen. and In the Third W.
R. Davis will be selected. San Francisco will have the privilege of receiving two
representatives, in the Fourth and Fifth districts, in the persons of C. B. Rode and
ex-Senator Frank McGowan. Warren Porter will represent the Sixth District, and
Chester H. Kowell. if he will be persuaoed by the powers that rule the convention,
will be the elector for the Seventh District. These nine men will be the Presiden
tial Electors for the Republican party In California. â¢ V "
PRACTICAL POLITICS OF THE RAILROAD.
This Is one way in which the Southern Pacific Company does practical politics
Theoretically, he knows nothing of what the convention will do to-morrow. H%
does not know who the chaiman will be, or who this unknown chairman will
choose to preside over the various committees.
Practically. J. W. McKinley of Los Angeles knows that to-morrow the con
vention will choose W. C. Van Fleet of San Francisco chairman of the conven
tion and that W. C. Van Fleet will choose J. W. McKinley chairman of the com
mittee on platform and resolutions.
Theoretically. J. W. McKinley does not know who his associates will be.
As a. practical politician, J. W. ' McKinley knows who the other members of
the committee will be and to-night he and they met In conference and practi
cally adopted the platform.
EQUIVOCAL VICTORY FOB THE EVIL DREIBTTND.
This compromise Is an equivocal victory for the Herrin-Kelly-Crimmin3 con
tingent, as it leaves to the Republican voters of San Francisco practically the
administration of their own affairs. With this compromise the serious duty of the
committee on credentials ends.
The committee on order of business will have simply a perfunctory duty to per
form.
The committee on platform and resolutions will proceed to extend the ordinary
compliments, to indorse the national administration, its policy, its leader and its
future; to indorse the Republican State administration and to plead for Repub
can success. J. W. McKInley of Los Angeles will be the chairman of the com
mittee on platform and resolutions. He is in a peculiar way a center of attrac
tion to-night in the lobby of the St. George Hotel.
Theoretically, he is simply a delegate to this convention.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SANTA CRUZ. Sept. 4.â The most Important
committee in the Republican convention will be the committee on cre
dentials. While the Southern Pacific Company Is doing what it pleases
In this convention there Is considerable evidence that It is not Inclined
to interfere definitely in the quarrel which has occurred in San Fran
clscc. The railroad company has the convention so thoroughly in hand
that it can do as it pleases and it appears to be willing to permit the Republi
cans of San Francisco to have at least an equal chance against the machine In
fluences which are attempting to ruin the party in the metropolis.
There will be before the convention two Important contests â one from the
Twenty-ninth Assembly District and the other from the Thirty-third Assembly
District, both of San Francisco. The Kelly-Herrin-Crimmlns contingent are here
with the purpose of demanding recognition for their disreputable methods In San
Francisco. The dominating Influences of this conx-ention are not prepared to re
turn the Kelly-Crimmlns-Herrin outfit thoroughly discredited and they will
therefore determine upon a compromise In their contests. It should be remem
bered that the committee on credentials la not yet appointed. That, however,
is not a matter of concern. While the committee has not already been formally
announced it has actually been chosen and to-night Its members have decided
that each of the contesting delegations from the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-third
Assembly districts shall receive an equal representation, which means half a
vote for the delegation.

The convention will assemble at 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon and will be
called to crd. r by Colonel George Stone, rhairman of the State Central Commit
tee, who win deliver a brief address. Ex-Supreme Justice \\\ C. Van Fleet of San
Frar.cisco wii! tn r n 1*? elected permanent chairman. In courtesy to the people
of Fanta Cruz, H. s. Wanzer of this city will be chosen secretary and Milton
Besse, Sheriff Â«/f this county, will be elected sergeant-at-arms. Ex-Judge Van
Fleet promises to be considerately brief In his remarks, and the convention. In
courtesy, will a?k him to appoint the committees on platform and resolutions,
credentials end order of business.
While the chairman of the convention is performing this serious duty, the
convention will take a recess, during which Samuel' M. Shortridge, who is to be
chosen one of the Presidential Electors-at-large, will deliver an address which
it is expected win be th*! creed of the California Republicans In this campaign.
Mr. Shortrldgp has beÂ«>n chosen to make this address at the request of some of
the most prominent members of the party, and it Is expected he will dispuss the
national Iffu^s in such a manner as to give to the Republicans of the'state the
key note of their policy in the campaign. Mr. Shortridge is considered to be one
of the most ?Â¦loquent orators in the Republican party, and there Is every as
surance that his rffort to-morrow will be no disappointment.
The reecpp which will be taken to permit the chairman to appoint the va
rious committees will continue for a few hours, when . the chairman will an
nounce his appointments. At noon of Thursday it is expected the convention wlU
conclude lta proceedings.
OPENING OF THE CONVENTION.
Simple as is this work of the general convention, it has excited more than
usual interest, particularly In reference to the control of the party machinery
in San Francisco. Machine politicians who have nothing more to recommend
themselves than their own audacity, the proprietorship of a cheap saloon and
the support of an indecent attorney of the Southern Pacific Company, expect to
secure from this convention an Indorsement of Iheir policy. In this they will
fail. Their effort, however, constitutes, perhaps, the only important element of
Interest which characterizes the convention. The point they seek to gain. will be
denied them by the Republicans of the State, and they will suffer the humilia
tion of knowing that the party which they presume to misrepresent will not tol
erate their plans. They came here to prostitute the interests of a national cam
paign to their own advantage and they will depart with whatever chagrin they
may feel at knowing that the Republicans of the State give to the Republicans
of Bar. Francisco the right to attend to their own .affairs.
ThÂ« people of Santa Cruz have been liberal in their provisions for the con
vention and generous In their arrangement. The largest hall In the cityâ Armory
Hall- has bf en given over to the delegates. It is a compact, daintily adorned
fctructure, brilliant with the national colors and emblematic of the party which
win he seated in convention to-morrow. The Mayor of the city, J. T. Parker,
win d^livfr the address of welcome and the delegates will be given entertain
ment by the citizens that will be elaborate enough to prove enjoyable.
THE PUSH AND THE RAILROAD.
SANTA CRTTZ. Sept. 4.â Santa Cruz Is In holiday attire to-night to wel
come the delegates to the Republican State Convention. The streets
are ablaze with lights; crowds are hurrying to and fro. There Is mu
sic, gossip, noise, enthusiasm in the air. The seaside city has done Its
best to welcome the politicians of the Republican party, and Â¦when
Santa Cruz does its best it does exceptionally well. The afternoon train
bro'jjrht thronjrs of visitor?, and there wore music and cheers and enthusiastic
greeting to receive them. By common consent the delegates assembled at the St,
Georjre Hotel, and to-night the lobby Is a hive of bustling, scheming, gossip-
Ing, planning politicians, all prepared for the opening of the convention to-mor
row afternoon.
This convention In a measure is unique In the history of politics of Califor
nia. It is dominated by one supreme Influence which will dictate the affairs of
the delegates even to the minutest detail. While the convention as a body will
not deal with Important events nor dictate important nominations, the South
ern Pacific Company Insists that even In what the convention will do railroad in
fluence must be felt. The convention as a whole will have nothing more to do
than to adopt a platform which, in effect, will be the platform of the national
Republican party. It will also choose two Presidential Electors-at-large and rat
ify the selection of the present Electors selected by the seven district conven
tions, into which the peneral convention will segregate after its first assembly.
In those Congressional districts in which Congressmen have not yet been nomi
nated selections will also be made by the district convention. Several Senato
rial ar.d Assembly nominees will be made, and it is expected that by Thursday
noon the general convention will adjourn.

Late " to-riight a curious complication
arose In reference to the election of Pres
idential Electors. Doctor Chester H.
Roweil of Fresno insists that the welfare
of the party will not permit him to be
Presidential Elector from the Seventh
Congressional District. < He declares that
he will demand of h!s district convention
that somebody farther south than he be
elected to represent the district and that
Captain William Mr-Fadden of Santa Ana
be' chosen in his place. If Doctor Roweil
carries out his threat it is likely to prove
of little avail as the delegates insist that
he be chosen to represent their district.
The prognostication, therefore, that Doc-
In the discussion by the leaders to-night
it was thought at first advisable to incor
porate in the platform a recommendation
for . the adoption of the constitutional
amendment which has already received
the indorsement of the Legislature for
the creation of three Appellate courts
subsidiary to the Supreme Court. These
courts, as already understood, were to de
cide certain cases and relieve the Supreme
Court of the burden under which it now
pways. Wiser councils prevailed, how
ever, and instead of incorporating this
resolution Into the platform It will be
made by resolution from the floor of the
convention. ?
i Â¦. Dr. Rowell's Bsfusal.
Many of the delegates here expected
that this convention would Insist upon its
privilege and elect a new State Central
Committee. The convention, however, will
not do so. The State Central Committee,
which was elected at Sacramento and
which now holds office, ha&.assum-:-d con
trol of the campaign in California and
necessarily must cany its work to a con
clusion. To rob it of its authority at this
â¢stage and to interject new officers and
new committeemen would be practically
political suicideand the convention, there
fore, will not interrupt the State Central
Committee in its tenure. If tho question
is discussed at all it will be simply by
vote to -reaffirm the appointment of the
State Central Committee which is new 111
office. This is considered to be en all
sides a matter of necessity.
While waiting for a decision from the
yellow building in San Francisco they in
terjected a new candidate into the fieldâ
Charles A. Swissler of El Dorado. The
Sacramer.tans tor a moment believed they
might create a deadlock and run Swlss'er
into the coveted position, and while they
hoped that they might do this they watted

to-morrow morning, and it is anticipated

San Francisco. Having studied for th#
medical profession, he had an Idea of be
coming associated with his cousin, but
the growing and glowing prospects of
Fresno County overbalanced those Inten
tions and he went there and settled down,
starting the Fresno Republican, a live,
wideawake journal. Having done so much
to plant Republicanism in the raisin
growing county, he wa3 nominated and
elected State Senator. During his term
in the upper house he has been honoreii
with the chairmanship of the Committee
on Hospitals, and Is a member of t5rÂ»
committees on county government, public
printing. irrigation, agriculture and
swamp lands.
He is a fluent speaker and a eood de
bater while making his points effectual on
the floor of the Senate. He la a married

worldly care a most devoted and soclablo

ELECTORS WHO ARE
TO BE SELECTED
The Curry-Robrecht bunch of Kelly-
Crimmins delegates In the Forty-third
District will make a fight to be seated In-
instead of the McNamara delegates, de
clared elected by the returning board In
the Thirty-third District the "Gassy"
Kelly-Haynes-Hennessy bouquet will
claim to be the real thing. F. W. Meyer,
one of the Fortieth District committee
men, says that the Aschheim delegation,
approved by the returning board and by
the County Ceneral Committee at itÂ»
meeting Saturday night, will probably be
contested In the convention. Gross frauds
are admitted to have been perpetrated In
the Fortieth District. Meyer claims that
the report on which the County Central
Committee acted Saturday night, present
ed by I. J. Ascliheim, was not signed by
the chairman and secretary of the district
committeemen, hence the action taken
was not valid.
â¢â¢We have been hard at work durlrg the
past two months distributing campaign
literature and impressing upon the voter*
their duty to register. Republicans have
taken an added interest in the campaign
and everything points to tho success of
our ticket."

I believe McKinley will have nearly 300
electoral votes; the" largest popular vote
since Lincoln. I believe this State will
give twenty or thirty thousand majority
for McKinley. W'e must devote our ef

that money has been secured to defeat
our candidates, not only for Congress, but
for the Senate.

likely to be true, notwithstanding his
thought that geographical considerations
meke some one else than he better fitted
to represent the district.

deserve comment. The fourth Is Edward

tum of Daniel M. Burns, supplicator for
anybody's favor and subject of a Grand

SKAGUAY, Alaska, Aug. 26. via Seattle,
Sept. 4. â The news of the awful fate that
befell three Indian children a few days
ago at the mouth of Glacier Bay, lead
ing to the great Muir Glacier, Is brought
by T. J. aiunley.
A party of six Indians ih a canoe, two
bucks, a pquaw and the three children,
were caught between two giant Icebergs,
while on their way across the water. The
glaciers, each as large above water a3 a
huge steamship, ground the canoe to
splinters. The older Indians escaped on
one of the bergrs, bu ttwo of the little ones
dropped between the bergs to a chilly
grave in the waters. The other child, a
girl perhaps 8 years of age, got upon a
berg by herself and was subjected to the
awful fate of having to remain there
while it drifted oft among countless other
bergs and carried her to what is con
sidered certain death. The older Indians
were rescued by a passing boat.
The berg which carried oft the little
castaway Is supposed to have In time
turned, as the bergs often do, and to then
have thrown tho child into the freezing
waters.

i ciers, Throwing the Occupants

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 4.â The State
Board of Equalization ended its term
for the year in a brief session to-day. The
only business transacted was the an
nouncement of the State tax rate at 49.3
cents for the year.* This was the figures
which had been given out in The Call
some days ago as most probable. The
rate, last year was 60.1 cents, thus the
decrease In the rate this year Is -10.3 cents
on each 1100. This decrease in the rate
in the result of an increase in the taxable
property of the State and a decrease in
the amount of money necessary to be
raised.
The State Board of Kqualization this
year departed from the practice of having
the various counties summoned before it
for the purpose of considering its assess
ment and determining whether or not the
figures should- be raised. The board hail
found that many County Assessois had
been making political capital among their
constituencies by placing their county as
sessments purposely low and "passing up"
to the State board the duty of raising
them to the proper figures. The board
accordingly ceased this custom and re
quired the Assessors to accept their
figures. ' There were a few counties, how
ever, which the equalizers believed should
have been raised, but It was llnally de
cided that nothing could profitably be
done In this direction and the. matter was
dropped. There had been some talk of
citing Alameda. Ix>s Angeles, Mendoclno,
Monterey, Sacramento, San Bernardino,
San Francisco, Santa Clara and Sonoma,
but nothing came of it and tho lively, ir
not acrimonious sessions, held in past
years when counties were cited were
missed In this year's term of the board.
Of the 49.8 cents on each $100, the tax
agreed upon, the general fund will re
ceive 25.5 cents, the school fund 21 cents,
sinking nnd Interest fund 1.3 cents and tho
university fund 2 cents. It will be neces
sary to raise $5,520,997, exclusive of the
amount required for the State University.
This Fact Is Due to an Increase
of the Taxable Property in
the State of Cali
fornia.
State Tax Rate Is Lowered
This Year by Over
Ten Cents.

Light Franchise Sold.
SANTA ROSA, Sept. 4.-Intercst
was aroused in this city to-day by
the report of a discovery of coal In
the hiUs on the Ilelsel ranch, a
short distance from town. In dig
ging a well William Helsel went
through a solid bed of coal, thirty
five feet In thickness. The sample
brought to this city is pronounced
first-class by a number of exports.
The well Is four feet across, and
this gives a good opportunity of
judging of the character of the de

mile and a half southeast of town.
The matter will be thoroughly in

EXCELLENT EXHIBITS
ENJOYED BY MANY
Oak Park Night at the State Fair En-
tirely Successful in Every
Respect.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 4.-The pavilion
contained a vast crowd to-night and tha
sights were enjoyed to the utmost. It
was Oak Park night, and over 1000 resi
dents of that thriving suburb made their
appearance and demonstrated their loyal
regard for the exposition as a State In
stitution. A pleasing feature of the oc
casion was the presentation on a large
screen of a number of fine photographs
of Oak Park and It3 environments.
Many of the leading citizens of Oak
Park manifested the festival spirit by ap
pearing in shirt waists. There was good
reason for the Jubilation -as the homo
cyclists of Oak Park had, at the park
tournament in the morning, attained a
brilliant victory over the vaunted riders
of the clubs from Sacramento, MarysvlUe,
Willows and Stockton.
The pavilion display as a whole enlists
the warmest admiration from visitors.
The art gallery is notably good, the pict
ures being quite generally of an order of
high merit. There Is a refreshing absence
of the painful efforts of infant prodigies
and misdirected amateurs, and In the
main It Is a collection creditable to the
State and its artists.
The vaudeville features provided, by the
Citizens' State Fair Club of Sacramento
are proving a distinct drawing card.
To-morrow will be Red Men's day. and
in the evening there will be presented a
number of tableaux Illustrative of th9
history of the order. The Red Men. who
are very strong in numbers In Sacra
mento, propose to make this day and
night a memorable one in their history-
Trie town is perfectly orderly despite tho
large numbers of people coming In by

P^edal Dl^rateh to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 4.â Sheriff
Frank T. Johnson said at 10 o'clock
to-night that he has not yet pained
a single new fact tending to estab
lish the Identity of the man or men
who murdered Hans Rasmusst-n and Wil
liam Taylor, the caretakers of two ranch
houses lying two miles apart, near the
town of Folsom. The Sheriff is working
hand in hand with Constable James Don
nolly of Folpom, and they are In constant
communication.
"I am convinced from all the lnforma-
tion I have," said Sheriff Johnson to
nipht, "that the rrmrdor was done by
somebody perfectly familiar not only with
the locality but with the premises occu
pied by tho murdered men, and I am cer
tain that Rasmuss"en was killed first,
probably while Taylor and the murderer
were at his house. That was Thursday
Diorning, and in the evening the murderer
visited" Taylor at his house. The table in
the kltr-hen showed that plates had lK-en
set for two. although nobody but Taylor
was supposed to be on the premises.
Crusts of bread were found on the floor
near tho body of Taylor. It Is my belief
that the murderer, after sitting down and
partaklnsr of Taylor's hospitality, pro
ceeded to kill him because of the danger
ous knowledge which he possessed of the
murder of Rasmussen earlier in the day.
"I have learned that both Rasmussen
and Taylor had been in Folsom the day
before they were killed. One of them
purchased a bottle of whisky, and It is
probable that they and the third party
had' hppn drinking and quarreled and that
the horrible murders followed."
Not a single Arrest has been made since
the murders were reported, and In spite
of all theories the mystery remains as
black as on last Sunday morning, when
the bodies of the two men wore found In
the widely separated houses riddled with
bullets.

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 4.â Another large
attendance greeted the trotters and run
ners at Agricultural Park this afternoon.
While the friends of the harness horse
were out in force, the Flash stake, at six
furlongs for thoroughbreds, attracted the
most attention. T/en sported silk, the rich
ly bred Magnet, ridden by Walker and
wearing the colors of Prince Poniatowski,
ruling favorite. George Covington had the
chestnut in grent fettle, and although he
had been in retirement for many moons
rcp-irts of phen -imenal workouts made him
a very warm lip. Of the other starters
Pompitio seemed to be about the only one
to have ar.y following.

Sreclal Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 4.â The dis
covery that thousands of Japanese have
been fraudulently converted into British
subjects In this province has caused a
tremendous sensation.
Before the salmon fishing season com
menced this spring thousands of Japanese
applied for fishing licenses, and as re
quired by law produced papers to show
that they were British subjects. Tho
white fishermen knew that these papers
were fraudulently obtained, but could
prove nothing. The fishermen's strike oc
curred soon after, but owing to so many
British Japanese being on the river who
would not join the strikers the white fish
ermen were ignomlniously defeated by the
canners. The fishermen's union then ap
pealed to the British Columbia Legisla
ture to investigate the apparent naturali
zation frauds. This the Government prom
ised to do, but could lind no pruof of fraud
unt'l a large number of Japanese llsher
men who had slipped over the line wtre
sent back to Canada by Uncle Sam as
pauper immigrants. These Japanese not
knowing that they had been manufac
tured into Britishers fraudulently ap
pealed to the authorities as British sub
jects. The rotten system of naturaliza
tion was then disclosed.
At the Supreme Court registrar's office
It was stated that there was no doubt
that thousands of fraudulent notaries'
declarations had been made nut, but the
Supreme Court had to accept them as
correct, as the oaths of the Japanese ap
plicants for naturalization had been set
forth in due form by the notaries. The
landing papers of the deported British-
Japanese further showed that they had
only come Into Canada last spring and
their naturalization papers tnp.de It appear
that all had sworn to a residence of four
years, the term of residence required by
law. The swearing of the newly arrived
Japanese of course was a mummery, as
the applicant, who was presumably buy
ing the "glorious privilege of a British
subject" from a pettifogging Japanese
lawyer, understood nothing of what was
said to him when the oath was adminis
tered in English by the dishonest notary.
Many of the newly arrived immigrants,
however, did not apparently even go
through the form of taking the oath, a
dummy being provided for the purpose,
and so far as the notary Â¦was concerned
all Japanese look alike to him. In such
cases the naturalization papers were
mailed to the converted Britisher at tho
northern salmon rivers of British Colum
bia on receipt of the amount as per agree
ment. The faultiness of the Canadian
naturalization laws Is being freely com
mented upon In British Columbia.

HONGKONG, SepL 4.-Influential na
tives state that the flame of rebellion has
been fajined In the southern provinces
and predict a tremendous conflagration
within a month. Placards and pamphlets
are being circulated in Canton and pro
vinces intimating that the ailles are thor
oughly routed. The feeling against for
eigners is bursting the bounds of official
control. The majority of the mission sta
tions in Kwangtung have been either de
stroyed or looted. Native Christians are
terribly abused. Natives in foreign em
ploy In Canton have been threatened and
a systematic looting has taken place In
houses of the English-speaking Chinamen.
Several reform parties with their head-
REBELLION WILL SPREAD
IN SOUTHERN PROVINCES
The correspondent adds: "This order
reads like a free warrant for the massa
cre of any Chinaman whom tho Cossacks
may provoke into a quarrel or prove to
be In possession of arms."
"It ls rumored that the Cossacks merci
lessly butchered men, women and chil
dren in tho villages on the Amur PJver
and flung their corpses into the stream.
These stories are tonlirmed by an official
order Just issued, couched in a mild note,
admitting the massacres, which are de
scribed as caused by exasperation against
the Chinese for beginning hostilities, and
threatening to utmost severity of martial
law for any future violence to unarmed,
peaceful Chinese, at the same time order
ing the police throughout the Amur dis
trict to compel the town and country pop
ulations to drag the Chinese corpses out
of the river and bury or burn them in or
der to prevent an outbreaJt of Infection."
There is f o sign yet of any decision on
the part of the powers regarding the Rus
sian proposals. The. Japanese papers un
rc-servedly condemn the Idea of evacuat
ing Peking and hint that there is a secret
compact between Germany and Russia to
the detriment of Great Britain and Japan.
The Moscow correspondent of the Stan
dard, referring to the horrible accounts
of Russian brutality at Blagovestchensk
after the bombardment, says:
â¢â¢Our St. Petersburg Minister has per
suaded Russia to leave Peking. You are
useless if you cannot persuade England."
It is asserted that Earl LI has promised
Russia three Manchurian provinces if she
secures the withdrawal of the allied
forces from Peking and favorable peace
terms from the powers. Both the Empress
Dowager and Lt Hung Chang are said to
be lavishing money to attain these ob
jects.
All telegrams have to be conveyed by
courier from Tsinan Fu to Peking, and
probably all cipher dispatches have been
stopped. According to Shanghai advices
Li Hung Chang wired the Chinese Minis
ter in London, Sir Chih Shen Lo Feng
Luh, as follows:
LONDON, Sept. 5, 4:15 a. m.â To-day's
disratches from Shanghai and Tientsin
refer to the hopeless confusion and mis
management of the Chinese telegraph
system which may probably account in
part for the delay in getting news from
Peking. Another reason for the delay
doubtless ls the anxiety of the Chinese
authorities to procure the evacuation of
the capital. No effort is being spared by
them to bring this about. Their idea is
that should the foreign Ministers in Pe
king be allowed free communication with
their governments the full extent of the
complicity of the Chinese Government in
the anti-foreign outrages would be re
vealed and would lead the alliee to decide
to remain until retribution had been ex
acted.

In order to ascertain what messages
have been received by General Chaffee
the department to-day instructed him to
acknowledge the receipt of all dispatches,
sent to him, giving the date on which they
left here. It Is stated, as the Peking date
has been cut from all dispatches received
from. General Chaffee. there is a possibil
ity that the Washington date has been re
moved from dispatches sent him. The de
partment Intends to get accurate informa
tion on this point. BSSBfeG&8i@
WASHINGTON, Sept." 4.-The War De
partment to-day received Information
that the work of laying a cable from
Shanghai to Chefu had commenced. It j a
believed that unless some accident ls en
countered the cable will be completed and
in operation within a week. This ought
to make communication between Wash
ington and our officials in China much
more expeditious.
LAYING CABLE FROM
SHANGHAI, TO CHEFU
All the transportation and tentage
asked for by General Chaffee has been
anticipated by the department and has
been shipped. Much of it is at Taku and
the balance ls due there very soon.
"I think it ls ample force for us unless
a political reason not apparent to me de
mands a larger force. I shall take 5000

winter in tents, and conical wall tents

WASHINGTON'. Sept. 4.â The following
dispatch was received to-day by the War
Department from General Chaftee:
CHAFFEE CABLES THAT
HE HAS. TROOPS ENOUGH
The practical cessation of trade with the
north has thrown thousands of Chinese
in each port out of employment, and they
are ready to Join the rebels. The French
aggression at Swatow and Japanese at
Amoy intensifies the hatred of foreigners.
Try* strike of the coolies at Hongkong is
ended.
The people are disheartened at the re
ported Intention of the powers to with
draw from China. Different societies are
combining to raise the standard of revolt
and overthrow the corrupt government.
quarters In Hongkong, who have been
supported by funds from rich Chinese in
the interior and in America, have hith
erto refrained from ag-gresstve action, be
ileving that the powers would affect a
regeneration of the Government. One
powerful organization is distributing thou
sands of copies of a reform appeal in the
British colonies. The memorandum has
been signed by 200 names for presentation
to the British Minister, imploring assist
ance of the reform government. It recom
mends establishing Nanking as the cap
ital and the selection of enlightened Chi
nese officials to administer the govern
ment with foreign advisers.
The journey of tne .Presidential candi
date across the Stiito was not devoid of
labor for him, for, though he left the train
but once on the journey, he made a num
ber of brief addresses from the rear plat
form of the hindmost car. This car was
especially adapted to Mr. Bryan's pur
poses, being a composite coach, including
sitting room, sleeping berths and kitchen.
It was one of two coaches comprising the
train supplied for the tour of Colonel Mc-
Graw, .Democratic national committeeman
for West Virginia. The train was boarded
at Benwood immediately after crossing
the Ohio River about noon, and on It to
receive him Mr. Bryan found McGraw
and Colonel L.. V. Baughman, the per
sonal representative of Senator Gorman,
national committeeman for this State.
Good time was made across the Alle
ghanies, and notwithstanding the numer
ous stops Cumberland was reached at
7:45 o'clock.
Beginning at Benwood, Mr. Bryan spoke
in succession at Cameron, Mannington,
Fairmont, Grafton. Deer Park and Pied
mont. He also made very brief remarks
at a few other places. At each place
there were goort*sized crowds and the can
didate was cordially greeted. The speeches
of the day manifested a somewhat greater
tendency to discuss economic questions
than had been shown on former occasions.
At Cameron he referred especially to the
Republican plea of prosperity, saying that
the worklngman wanted not only a "full
dinner pail/' but much more besides. He
charged significantly that the cost of ar
ticles necessary to the existence and com
fort of the workingmen had been put out
of proportion to the Increased price of
labor.
During the day Mr. Bryan's attention
was called to on extract from a Now
York Republican newspaper saying that
Mr Bryan had mnde more money out 01
the oat crop raised on hla Lincoln farm
the present season than the entire farm
had cost him. putting the result at $1400
on 120 acres of land. Commenting upon
this statement Mr. Bryan said:
The entire farm contains only thirty acres
and cost me nearly $1000. although the land ls
not worth that much to-day. Instead of having
120 acre* in oata I had only live acres in oats
and the oats have not yet been threshed. They
will hardly yield forty bushels to the acre.
Oats. Instead of beins 30 cents a bushel in Ne
braska, are worth 21 cents in Chicago. My
cat crop will not brlntr me over $10. The five
acres ujon which the oats were raised cost me a
little more than $100 an acre, so that the gross
income this year will be less than 8 per cent on
the original Investment. After taking out the
cost of seed, cultivation, harvesting and thresh
ing: the income will be reduced to less than 5 per
cent. The. Republican papers use my farm to
Illustrate the prosperous condition of the farm-
Mr. Hryan spoke without notes, and he
appeared at tne meeting almost immedi

which had brought inin across the State
of West Virginia and thus far into tho
State of Maryland. Tne journey had been
an arduous ont-, covering, including the
trip trom Chicago, about twenty-four
hours ot railroad riding. Still Mr. liryan
appeared in excellently good order ami he
spoke with his customary vim and vigor.
CUMBERLAND, Md., Sept. 4.â The
op9ning of the Democratic campaign for
the States of Maryland and West Virginia
at this place to-night was rendered mem
orable by the appearance on the same
platform of the Democratic national
standard-bearer, \V. J. Bryan, and United
States Senator Gecrge Wellington, who
was elected as a Republican. Both these
distinguished gentlemen were In good
voice and both spoke with their accus
tomed force. Senator Wellington's speech
marked his formal renunciation of party
ties on account of the Issues growing out
of the war with Spain. He had for this
reason prepared his speech with care and
he read it from typewritten manuscript.

OPENING OF THE
MISSOURI CAMPAIGN
SEDAUA, Mo.. Sept. 4. â The opening of
the Republican State campaign in Sedalia
to-day was held tinder most favorable
circumstances as to weather and attend
ance, nearly 10.0CX) people coming to town
and the day being perfect. The parade of
marching clubs, delegations and mounted
rough riders made a tine exhibition. There
were sixteen bands in line, exclusive of
drum and bugle corps, the total number
of paraders exceeding 3000.
"President McKinley is but the pro
consul of the English Queen in the man
agement of American affairs."
- As Wellington proceeded in abuse of
President McKinley the signs of disap
proval began again to mingle with the ap
plause. There Â¦were occasional cries of
"Put him out." One voice yelled, "Bene
dict Arnojd," and another called for "16
to 1."
Wellington declared his conviction that
Reference to Admiral Schley caused
loud applause, though not so much atten
tion was given to the assertion that "the
gentle Roosevelt was saved from utter
annihilation by a colored regiment which
swept over and beyond him."
Embroilment with the natives followed. They
were jealous of foreign power. They hoped for
treatement as allies: they longed for freedom:
they demanded the right to establish thplr own
government. It was denied. The policy of

lentlrss war. It has lasted two campaigns.
It has cost us many precious lives and nearly
five hundred millions of money of the eoM
standard by this time. Yet what have we ac
complished? At the end of the first campaign
thÂ« Filinlnos were within five miles of Ma
nila. Since that time we are resaled fre
quently by reports that the war ls almost over.
But the other day an American garrison sur
rendered to the Filipinos, and I doubt whether
our lines have been much advanced beyond the
five miles for a year.
Bryan's election the hisses, which had for
a time been growing in volume, became
ferocious. The Senator stopped short in
his speech and said:
"Did you ever hear that there were
three things that hiss now and then? The
first is a serpent, the second a goose and
the third a fool."
This sally brought a roar of applause,
which was followed by a still larger vol
ume of hisses. These soon subsided, how
ever, and afterward the interruptions
were for a time neither so frequent nor so
pronounced.
Continuing. Wellington referred to Ad
miral Dewey's "bloodless victory." say
ing:
'.'In the last Congress." he said, "the
money measure became a law. These
questions are settled for the present at
least. There is no immediate danger of an
attack upon the tariff, notwithstanding
tho fact that the Republican party has sur
rendered the idea of protection. And there
is not at Issue in this campaign any direct
legislation upon the money question, for
there is no possibility that there should be
within the next four years after Mr. Bry
an's .election unified majorities rn both
houses of Congress."
At the mention of the probability of Mr.
I cannot see my v/ay clear to Inveigh against
Imperialism, against the uncongtltutlonallty of
the Porto Klco tariff bill, the unriRhteousness
of attempting to enslave the Inhabitants ot the
Philippine Islands and the dishonor of breaking
our pledge to Cuba, and then, because of the
mandate of n sinister Influence which. dominates
the President, forswear my convictions, set at
naught ray declarations and do as did Senator
Hoar and others, appeal to the past and the
future. The past Is dead. I cannot change
it. No appeal will reach its deaf ear. The fu
ture Is not in my keeping, and It ls not In my
power to fashion it. Therefore I am here to
night to reiterate the convictions I voiced In
the Senate and record my opposition to the
principles of President McKinley as evidenced
In his foreign policy, and with all the vehe
mence of a positive nature protest against the
violation of the principles upon which our
Government ls founded; against the desecration
of the constitution and the reversal of the
policy which has given us a century and a
quarter of national prosperity such as the his
tory of man hath not recorded In any age or
clime.
I am here to-night to declare my unalterable
antagonism to the policy of Imperialism and
my opposition to the representatives of that
vicious principle. It Is an occasion of more
than ordinary Importance for any man to an
tagonize the political party which he has served
for a quarter of a century: to which he haa
given the best years of his life and through
which he has achieved success. It brings much
bitterness and vituperation. The vials of wrath
heve already opened upon me and there will
be much unpleasant work to do. I have deter
mined, however, to do that which Is best In
the Interest of my country, nnd I do so In
the same spirit which. was manifested by Lln
cdn when he stood upon the steps of the na
tional Capitol and In his inauguration address
said: "With malice toward none, with char
ity for all, with firmness to do the right as
Ood gives me the power to see the right," I
r.ill do my whole duty, and in the performance
of that duty I flnd It necessary not only to
otpose the re-election of McKinley. but to
emphasize that position by supporting Mr.
Uryan who in this election stands for free
government according to the constitution. .
Senator Wellington, continuing, said the
nation was at the parting of the ways and
must decide for all time for weal or woe.
and he believed the present tendency of
the Republican party was full of Inevit
able dangers and disasters. He did not
believe there was any danger of material
changes in the tariff and financial Iaw3
in case of Mr. Bryan's election.
As to the governmental policy President Mc-
Kinley has developed I was compelled to Jlffer
from It at several points and gave evidence
0' my disagreement In the speeches delivered
by me during: the past three years upon the
lloor of the Senate touching the Spanish-Ameri
can wax. the Philippine Islands. Porto Rico
and South African affairs. Upon the prin
ciples therein advanced I stand to-day. I gave
friendly warning to the Republican party that
if they became responsible for certain policies
I would not tollow. Therefore, the party hav
inK become so responsible. I am compelled to
refuse submission to Its behests and to range
myself against it for conscience.
CUMBERLAND, Md., Sept. 4.â Senator
Wellington made the first speech of the
evening. He was listened to with inter
est and was frequently applauded, al
though at times there were very pro
nounced hisses. The Maryland Senator
lost no time in declaring his opposition to
the present administration and his deter
mination to support Mr. Bryan. He had
taken this position, he said, because of
his views upon the Spanish war and its
consequences, and because of his oppo
sition to imperialism. He caid:

The Associated Press representative
learns from official sources the fa<:ts of
the killing of several American women
missionaries. At the request of the mis
sion board, the details were withheld out
of regard for the feelings of the relatives
c>f the murdered women; but other promi

lated inland posts think it important that
the facts should be known. The names
of the victims are withheld by request.
Most Revolting Tortures.
Two of these women were captured
while attempting to leave the stations
where they were located, were led about
the country naked, were repeatedly out
raped and finally killed by a method too
revolting to be described. Two other
American women were coming to tht
coast with a party, which a number ot
Chinese followed and stoned. The women
fell exhausted and were taken by the Chi
nese into the presence of the local offi
cials. They were prostrated upon the ex
ecution block and a feint was made of
beheading them. One of them became
hysterical and laughed, and thinking her
Insane the Chinese escorted her to the
coast because of their superstition re
garding the Insane. On the Journey, how
ever, the woman was repeatedly crimi
nally assaulted by her escort. The other
woman, after being; exhibited naked for
some days and suffering assault by sev
eral men. was tortured to death by the
same shameful methods as were prac
ticed in the other cases. Two Swedish
missionary women arrived at Shanghai
after similar experiences, except that
their lives were spared. The foregoing
are matters of official record.

The fourteen English missionaries. In

were murdered at Chuchau, in the pro

of a Spanish priest who escaped, were
killed with hayforks and ancient spears

incidents make a lenient policy unpopular

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
CALIFOBNIANS IN WASHINGTON
CALIFORNIANS IN NEW YOBK.
DIPLOMATIC DEGREES OF ACTION.
OUT of the situation in China there will come
2t least one benefit to us all. We are learning
now, and probably will never forget, the in
tricacies of diplomacy; and the carefully chosen term?
ured to express the delicate phases of international
proceedings.
By studiously following the reports we have all
found out there is no war in China, nor any alliance
oil the part of the powers. The proceedings which
led upto the fightin? at Tientsin were not taken by
the powers in alliance, but by what is called in diplo
macy '"concurrent action." When an advance on
Peking was decided vpon it was taken not by con
current action, but by "joint action," because a little
closer relationship was necessary between the "pacify
ing forces." Now that the troops of the powers are
duly seated victoriously in the pacified city, joint
action is no longer sufficient for the emergency, and
there will be needed '"co-operation."
To the uninitiated co-operation and prolonged
occupation of the Chine?e capital may seem very close
to being war between certain allied powers and China.
Such views, however, are erroneous. Within the
etiquette of diplomacy there are still several degrees
between the nations md an alliance. After occupation
there is to come "joint control" and then "united
rction." Not until united action has been tried and
proved unequal to the strain will there be an alliance,
and until there is an alliance there will be no war.
Thus do we learn that there is no danger of grave
occurrences in China. Men may cry war, war, but
there is no war. The concert of Europe has. with thÂ»
assistance of the United States, raised a grand sweet
for.p; of peace, but the song is sung not in chorus, but
by concurrent voices. So there is nothing to be
alarmed about. Should any one get killed in China,
it will be due not to a battle but to a riot, an unavoid
able accident, or a dispensation of providence.
Democrats of the State of Vermont, it is <aid. are
unusually active this year. Perhaps they are getting
ready to leave the State before the crash.
fÂ± N exhibition of the work of the late
II Raymond D. Yelland will be held at
1^1 the Hopkins Art Institute in the lat-
I tor part of September. It is hoped
7 > that some products of the artist's
clever brush may find place in our city
gallery, where a hopeful nucleus for a
future distinguished collection of native
work already exists. As one of our best
landscape painters, Mr. Yelland's work
should hnd a worthy place in any Califor
nian gallery.
Mr. Joseph D. Greenbaum is again to
desert California and to returnâ of course
âto Paris. He will- leave San JJranclsco
in the earlier part of October and will
stay an indefinite number of years in the
artistic hub of the universe. It is possible
that there may be an exhibition of the
artist's work, including the interesting
Monterey sketches made this summer, be
fore his departure. Â¦.
N. Moller exhibits two portraits in one
of the local galleries this week. They are
both of the same subject, the picturesque
old figure of Pioneer John Perry Jr., with
his quaint old stock and quainter collar
of bygone days. They are harmless and
amiable productions, absolutely without
distinction, treated in a timid, shadowy
fashion as regards brush work, of a fem
inine pink and whiteness in the flesh, and
an impossible smoothness. The pose is
pood and the "likeness" readily recog
nizable.
There is another Welch landscape on ex
hibition' this week. "June in Marin
County." June in Marln County, accord
ing to Mr. Welch, is a beautiful time. It
is a foothill subject, and the artist has
cnught the Callfornian color in happiest
fashion. It Is full of movement, atmos
phere and strong outdoor feeling. No
studio picture is this.
Sydney J. Yard sends up from Monterey
pome summer sketches of sand and sea.
wlnd-blown pines and gray old rocks, all
water colors. Among them is a rare im
pression of an incoming tide, with a fine
bit of foreground, but the sky is flat and
uninteresting, and the rocks without con
viction. A Pacific Grove subject with a
pine tree in shadow and sunlight in the
middle distance is a nice study of values
There is a fine photogravure reproduction
of Lenbach's "Duse" to be seen this week
with all the subtle, distinguished and pas
sionate character of the actress cleariv
k in evidence in the clever posing and con
ception. Another Lenbach reproductionâ
as commonplace as the "Duse" is admir
able, may also be seen.
ART, AND ARTISTS.
SOME NOTABLE OMISSIONS.
WILDLY do the yellow organs of the Bryanites
rage against trusts, and fiercely do they strike
here and there among the mass of corporations.
At first glance one would suppose they were dealing
out their blows impartially, striking at every head in
sight and hitting wherever they can hit hardest. A
little observation, however, will show there is method
in their madness, that in all their striking they arc very
careful not to hit the ice trust nor the express trust.
Indeed, they avoid those iniquitous combinations as
if they were not, and appear desirous to have the
people forget that such trusts exist. 'Â«
There is something peculiar about the indulgence
granted by the screaming and cudgeling yellows to
those two trusts, for they are by all odds the greatest
exponents of all the abominations of trusts. The ice
trust was formed to effect a monopoly control of ice
in New York City, where during the. sweltering sum
mer months ice is a necessity of life. It was the
scheme of the monopoly to raise the price of ice to
consumers of every grade, but particularly to the poor.
The price of ice in small quantities was raised to a
point where it constituted a genuine extortion. The
outrage was so infamous it aroused the whole city to
wrath, and then came a fight against tht trust which
resulted in bringing to light the fact that Crokcr, the
Tammany boss, Van Wyck, the Tainmany Mayor, and
a number of other eminent stalwarts of Tammany
were stockholders in the trust and were using their
official power to promote its extortionate programme.
Not less greedy in its schemes and far more widely
grasping in its extortions than the ice trust is th*
express company trust. That combination has divided
all the territory of the United States among its mem
bers, and not only fixes express rates at an exorbitant
figure to the public, but shirks upon its patrons the
taxes imposed by Congress for the mainvenance of the
war which Bryan was so vehement in advocating, but
which he is now denouncing with an equal vehemence.
Of this grasping, greedy, tax-shirking trtist the yellow
organs have nothing to say. Like the ice trust, it is
a Bryan concern. President Valentine of Wells-
Fargo, one of the biggest hogs in the combine, has
"come out" for Bryan, has written a letter advocating
his election, and now, like the Tammany ic e trust, the
tax-shirking express tiust is* immune from the attacks
of the yellows.
Such is the way in which the Bryanites are waging
their fight against trusts. The so-called fight is a
sham. Any kind of a trust can find favor with the
gang by simply standing in for Bryan as Croker and
Van Wyck have done in New York and Valentine in
California.

THE SCHOOL BOARD.
THOSE who believed that taking the creation of
a School Board out of the ballot-box, away from
conventions and polls, and giving it to the Mayor
z> a sort of preferred elector, was a desirable thing,
have leisure now to repent of that belief which they
incorporated in the charter.
Instead of intelligently directing the schools, im
partially considering their needs and judging justly
the qualifications of teachers. Mayor Phelan's board
has done more patronage trading and vicious tinker
ing in the schools than any of its elected predecessors.
It assumes entire independence of public opinion
and the wishes of taxpayers, professional educators
and all who are competent to advise or have the right
to counsel.
Nothing is more offensive in an official than the
concealment of ignorance of his duties behind a
pompous pretense that he knows it all and is above
advice.
Thi? pompous ignorance is one of the infuriating
peculiarities of this board. It has oppressed teachers
who have more knowledge than could be extracted
from the whole board, with the Mayor thrown in as
a makeweight. They have been juggled out of what
the law intended to be a vested right, and the lowest
of low cunning has been used to evade the legal con
sequences of their oppression.
If this board of ha' f- Latin ers, of intriguers and in
competents, is permitted to j?o on in the way it has
btfrun the schools of San Francisco will lose the
â¢ - mtorzpmt Â¦Â¦Â¦-. -'-
prestige the}- pained even under rather bad partisan
management, and will be a hissing and byword
throughout the country.
The different organizations of citizens which have
been snubbed and insulted by this board should per
sist in their demands. The hide of the aggregate
board may be as thick as a board, but the sharp claws
of public opinion can scratch through it if they keep
on scratching.
FROM
SEA
AND
SHORE
German Steamer Tanis Will
Take Away a Valuable
Samoa Is Docked and the Work cf
Fitting the Vessel to Carry-
Horses to China Will
Be Bushed.
The German steamer Tanls is taking
away from here one of the largest and
most valuable cargoes ever shipped from
this port. Among it will be 500 tons of
concentrates, 3000 barrels of tallow, 100
barrels of oil and 5000" barrels of wine. All
the stuff offering cannot be carried, co
the extra boat the Kosmos people have
put on for the latter part of this month is
badly wanted.
The Tanis is expected to sail to-night.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Mari
posa will also get away for Australasian
ports.
Germany's Horse Transports.
The Samoa docked at Howard-street
wharf last night. She took the berth va
cated by the ship Fingal. Before leaving
here a great deal of "rush" work has to
be done on the Samoa, and the job -was
given to the Risdon Iron Works. An
electric light plant is to be installed, ven
tilators put in. a distilling plant erected
and all the stalls and appurtenances for
the accommodation of SoO horsea put in
place.
The other transport for the German
Government that arrived Sunday will alsa
dock at Howard street. The Frankfurt
sailed from Tsintau. China, yesterday, for
San Francisco In ballast. She is a very
large "tramp," and it is expected that she
can be fitted up to carry 1000 horses or
mules.
The Doric Released
The mall steamer Doric was released
from quarantine yesterday. Her cabin
passengers were landed Monday night,
but those in the steerage had to remain
aboard until the vessel was released by
Dr. Kinyoun. - t
Steamship Tellus Released.
Brigantine Pitcairn Sold
w The steamship Tellus was released by
the United States authorities yesterday
on a bond of J10.000 filed with United
States Commissioner Morse. The vessel
had been tied up in litigation arising out
of a recent collision between the Tellus
and the Belgian King.
The brigantine Pitcairn was sold by auc
tion at noon yesterday in front of the Mer
chants* Kxchange, United States Marshal
John H. Shine being the auctioneer. The
vessel was knocked down to Henry Ar
nold for $1365.
Petitions For and Against Gray Bros.'
Rock-Crusher Filed With the
Board.
The Board of Supervisors met yesterday
afternoon in accordance with the pro
visions of the charter, -which says that
when Monday is a legal holiday the board
shall meet on the next day. There was no
quorum present and an adjournment was
taken until this afternoon.
A communication was received from res
idents in the district near Twenty-sixth
and Douglass streets stating that in their
judgment the stoppage of Gray Brothers'
rock crusher would be against the best in
terests of the district and the city. They
recite that they, have been informed that
the quarry is serving a useful purpose to
the city; that a great number of men are
employed there, whose families will be
deprived of their income if the operations
of the crusher are discontinued, and that
$3000 is paid out each month by the quarry
managers.
Another petition from property owners
was filed to have the crusher and quarry
doclared a nuisance and removed forth
with.
SUPERVISORS MET AND .
ADJOURNED UNTIL TO-DAY
SCHOOL BOARD
ORDERS A NEW
CLASSIFICATION
Webster's Schedule of En
rollment Is Practically
Accepted.
Superintendent Declares That He Will
Nevertheless Exercise His Pre
rogative Regarding Gracl
. ing of Public Schools.
The Board of Education issued a new or
der on classification yesterday, in which
its former rule requiring fifty pupils in
first grade classes and ai least fifty-flve
pupils in other grades has been practically
abrogated. The action of the board,
which will be confirmed at this morning's
meeting, is regarded as a concession to
Superintendent Webster, whose enroll
ment was placed at forty-five and fifty
pupils in the fjrades named. In the new
order a classification has been established
for each school and is based on the reports
of principals for the month of August
showing the average number of pupils en
rolled per class. Chairman Mark sayB the
number given may increase slightly dur
ing September and October. In a few
cases it will be necessary for the board to
adjust the classification by requiring in
some instances more pupils per class and
in others less. In but one school has the
claslficatlon been fixed at fifty-five pupils,
namely, the Longfellow Grammar, -which
has the full limit. The lowest is the Poly
technic High, owing to the differentiated
course cf study and the necessity of hav
ing teschers for special lines of instruc
tion. The board intends to visit and ad
just schools where the average monthly
enrollment exceeds fifty and where the
average daily attendance falls below for
ty-live. The classification as now ar
ranged follows:

Chairman Mark further states that the
number of teachers who have lost their
positions by the recent consolidation of
classes is only eight, that is. eight who
havo not been arsigned regularly to other
classes. However, there are six teachers
who lost their positions by the abolition
of certain schools.
Notwithstanding: the modification of its
classification by the board. Superintendent
"Webster expressed his intention yesterday
to go before the board at this morning's
meeting: and enforce the prerogative vest
ed in him by the State law on classifica
tion of schools. 'Webster says that his
counsel has succeeded in discovering- cer
tain sections of the law which widen his
functions and give him the power to grade
schools as well as to classify them. He
will llle a statement with the board con
taining a declaration that he will im
mediately proceed to enforce the grading
and classification upon which he has al
ready issued orders. He will delegate his
deputies to inspect each school and report
upon the condition of tne classes. Should
he find that additional classes are neces
sary he will open them and ask the board
to assign teachers to take charge of
them. If the School Board refuses he will
appoint the teachers himself and each
month issue to them salary demands
drawn directly upon the city treasury.
M 'I do not wish to act arbitrarily in this
matter," said Mr. Webster yesterday,
"and I will therefore lay before the board
my plens before exercising my rights. I
intend to assume all the respopsibiUUes
myself and will place no burdens on the
teachers. New classes will be opened by
me wherever I deem such action neces
sary to conserve the best interests of the
school."
Claims That the Provision t'j Tay
Interest on Bonds Not Yet
Issued Invalidates tha
Budget.
Supervisor McCarthy made the assertion
yesterday that he believed the tax levy
adopted by the beard last June Is an il
legal one and that at the next raoetlns
he will introduce a resolution providing
for the adoption of a new tax rate accord
ing to the provisions of the Political Code.
There has been considerable controversy
over the charter provision requiring the
lining of the rate in June and the Stata
law which seta the third Monday in Sep
tember as the date therefor. The mat
ter of the legality of the rats had, how
ever, never been formally Questioned be
fore.
McCarthy supports hl3 contention by
claiming that the board had no legal
right to impose a tax amounting to $2Q3,oCO
which was set a3ide in the budget to pay
the interest on and establish a sinking
fund lor the payment of the park pan
handle bonds, school-house bonds and
sewer bonds. McCarthy says the bonds
have not been issued yet and that by
levying a tax in advance of their Issu
ance tne board has exceeded its authority
and has therefore invalidated the whoi<*
levy. He quotes the charter, which aayrf
la section 2 of chapter 1, article 3, that
-on or before the iirst Monday in May
the Auditor shall transmit to the buper
vtsora an estimate of the probable ex
penditures of the city and county govern
ment for the next ensuing liscal year,
stating- the amount required tn meet tha
interest and sinking funds for all out
standing funded debts." etc. McCarthy
says that the bends are not outstanding.
They are in litigation and may be de
clared invalid.
McCarthy further says that by the
adoption cf the levy in September under
the ritatc law the rate may be consider
ably reduced. He figuroa out roughly that
the elimination of the fSBSJSM for intere a t
and sinking fund and the increase of tho
assessment roll from th'r estimated figure
of $375,000,000 to JlW.WO.W'.the rate for cur
rent expenses of tho city to be raised by
taxation could be brought down to .^i
cents iiiritrad of $1,127 on every JIM. In
any event he says that the dispute snou.d
be adjusted and he hopes by the intro
duction of his resolution to settle it 0110
way or the other. He sa3'9 al?o that there
is no provision in the charter as to when
the taxes shall be collected ar-d here again
the State law becomes operative. He
thinks that an ordinance on that point la
necessary so that the taxes may be legal
ly collected by the Tax Collector.
A conference was hf-ld in Auditor WelLV
office vesterday at -which that oiHcial and
Supervisors Jennings and Hotalinsj dis
cussed the advisability of readoptingr the
tax levy on the third Monday in Septem
ber. The Supervisors â¢ named admitted
the soundness of Auditor Wells' argu
ment that the levy should be recon
sidered. It was agreed to have another
rr.retins at which Mayor Phelan and
Supervisor Tobin and Reuben II. Lloyd
will take up the question and decide on
the necessary course to be pursued.

McCarthy Will Move for the
Adoption of New Rate
in September.
PROMISES TO THE PEOPLE.
T~\OOSEVELT'S address at Chicago on Labor
k-/ day contains in at careful discussion of labor
problems much that merits the earnest con
sideration of all citizens. No portion of it, however,
is more pertinent to the time than that in which he
pointed out the tendency of irresponsible reformers
to promise more than they can possibly fulfill. We
fhall have plenty of tuch promises between now and
election day, and it is therefore timely to warn the
credulous against putting too much trust in them.
Speaking upon that point, the orator said: "Noth
ing does more to prompt mental dishonesty and moral
insincerity than the habit of either promising the im
possible or of demanding the performance of the im
possible, or finally of failing to keep a promise that
has been made; and it makes not the slightest differ
ence whether it is a promise made on the stump or oft'
the stump. Remember that ti>ere are two sides to
the wrong thus committed. There is first the wrong
of failing to keep the promise made, and in the next
place there is the wrong of demanding the impossible
and therefore forcing or permitting weak or unscrup
ulous men to make a promise which they either know
or should know cannot be kept. No small part of our
trouble in dealing with many of the gravest social
questions, such as the so-called labor question, the
trust question and others like them, arises from these
two attitudes. The success of the law for the taxation
of franchises recently enacted in New York State
offers a striking contrast to the complete breakdown
of the species of crude and violent anti-trust legisla
tion which has been so often attempted and which has
always failed because of its very crudeness and vio
lence to make any impression upon the real and dan
gerous evils which have excited such just popular re
sentment."
There is of course nothing new in all that. Its value
lies in its pertinence to the demagogue promises
which are being made in reference to our political and
industrial problems. As a matter of fact, the evil has
been in the world ever since men began to discuss
reform legislation. Shakespeare has depicted the typ
ical agitator in the famous speech put into the mouth
of Jack Cade: "There shall be in England seven half
penny loaves sold for a penny; the three-hooped pot
shall have ten hoops; and I will make it a felony to
drink small beer; all the realm shall be in common,
and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass; and
when I am king, as king I will be, there shall be no
money; all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will
apparel them all in our livery that they may agree like
brothers and worship me their lord."
With such words did the master delineator of men
hit off the promises of the demagogues of all times
and of all lands. Who is there that upon reading them
cannot recognize the great American agitator of to
day? There will be in this campaign of course 110 talk
cf the three-hooped pot, small beer, grazing horses in
Cheapside nor appareling men in livery; but virtually
the American demagogue will promise much the same
things as Jack Cade. It will be a promise impossible
of fulfillment, even were the promisor made sovereign
of the state; and it can serve no other purpose than
that of exciting unreasonable desires and provoking
resentments against the existing order of things.
One further statement of Mr. Roosevelt should be
seriously considered bj all in these times when labor
and capital alike are trying to solve the new problems
which have arisen out of the complexities of recent
economic developments: ",\Vc shall all go up or down
together. Some may go up or go down further than
others, but, disregarding special exceptions, the rule is
that we must all share in common something of what
ever adversity or whatever prosperity is in store for
the nation as a whole. In the long run each section of
the community will rise or fall as the community rises
or falls. If hard times come to the nation, whether as
the result of natural causes or because they are invited
by our own folly, all of us will suffer. Certain of us
will suffer more and others less, but all will suffer
somehow."
Of the truth of that statement there will be no
doubt in any quarter. Consequently there will be a
general recognition that the wild promises of dema
gogues are menacing not to those only who believe
them, but to the whole community. The issues of
the time must be dealt with honestly and with reason.
Up to this time the American people have found a
wise solution to every problem that has confronted
their progress as a nation, and an equal good fortune
will attend them in this case, provided they are not
misled by the specious promises of demagogues.
POLITICAL HYPOCRISY
WR. HEATtST is the greatest newspaper man
in the world. We make this statement on
* the best authority. He says so himself and
prints it in the Examiner. He also claims to have
the only really Democratic newspapers in the United
States, and is also president of the National Asso
ciation of Bryan Clubs, and goes around with Mr.
Bryan telling the people that if McKinley is elected
the country will turn up its toes and die, with bloody
spume oozing from its lips, all on account of Mc-
Kinley holding the Philippines.
We have heretofore quoted copiously from Hearst's
opinions in the Examiner, proving him to have been
one of the original imperialists and to be now either a
coarse hypocrite or a man who seeks power for his
party regardless of the means used.
November 10, 1898, and that is not yet two years
ago, after the result of the elections was before the
country, Hearst said in the Examiner: "The vote of
this election is a vote of approval for the war and the
principle of expansion and for the greater conserva
tism of the Republican party. Local issues, every
where in favor of the Democrats, have failed to in
fluence voters to abandon the main issue. It is both
right and reasonable that the administration which,
despite some mistakes, carried this glorious war to a
successful conclusion, should receive a vote of confi
dence. It is both right and reasonable that the policy
of expansion, ever the policy of the American people
since Jefferson annexed the Louisianas, should re
ceive the approval of the American voters, Republi
can and Democratic. The Democratic National lead
ers have been narrow and stupid beyond belief, and
the Journal and Examiner have warned them time
and again of the inevitable results of their stupidity.
The Democratic press and the Democrats in Congress
brought on the war, and then the Democratic leaders
under the control of Bailey, influenced by petty
jealousies, forced the Democratic party into an atti
tude of opposition to the very war they had brought
en: forced it further into an attitude of opposition to
the Democratic policy of expansion, to the very prin
ciples of Jefferson", the father of American Democ
racy !
'The suicidal attitude of the Democratic leaders
began with opposition to the annexation of Hawaii.
These leaders proposed driving a Democratic Con
gress into caucus to oppose annexation. The Journal
sent its representative editors to Washington and
fought this caucus, and broke it up and prevented the
Democracy making a formal and conspicuous idiot
of itself on that occasion. But the narrowness of the
leaders continued and developed a tendency to op
r.ose every Republican act, even though it embodied
a Democratic principle.
"The Democratic defeat is not due to the Demo
cratic people or to Democratic principles, but to
Democratic leaders, who having, as we say, brought
on the war, refused to share the honors of the war
or to acquire for the people the lasting benefits of the
war. The Democratic leaders do not speak for the
Democracy, and Republicans have been everywhere
elected with the aid of Democratic votes."
That editorial is signed "W. R. Hearst." He
wanted everybody to know that he could write an edi
torial and that he had views.
Two days later, November 12, 1898, Hearst said in
the Examiner, large type and double column: "The
Democratic party, defeated because of the pusillani
mous stupidity of its leaders in Washington, has the
chance of a splendid regeneration in taking up the
forceful doctrine of national expansion and giving all
of its energies to the furtherance of the nation's mani
fest destiny. It is high time to stop snarling at every
thing advocated by the Republicans, whether good,
bad or indifferent. Give the people some patriotic
rallying eric?; set the Democratic standards well in
the advance of national progress. When it was pro
posed to annex Hawaii many of the Democratic lead
ers opposed taking this rich offering so freely ten
dered. Why? Generally because the annexation was
favored by the Republican administration. Yet the
people were practically unanimous for annexation,
and the Democratic leaders lost the confidence of the
masses by their stupid, purblind opposition. They
became the stumbling-blocks in the path of progress.
Then, when it came to securing military bases in the
West Indies, these same Democratic leaders chaf
fered and haggled over kerns of war expenditure.
Now again they are giving evidence of opposing the
popular will in the matter of the annexation of the
Philippines. It is high time to call a halt. The
Democratic party will not follow such leaders. The
people already have jcpudiated it."
On November 15, 1898, Mr. Hearst again appeared
over his own signature to this effect: "It should be
particularly humiliating to the Democratic leaders in
Congress to think that all the successes that the Re
publicans have won have been won on Democratic
lines. The policy of Jefferson was the policy of ex
pansion, a broad policy, looking forward to the grow
ing importance of this great nation, providing greater
territory and offering larger opportunities for the
people. Yet Bailey and other so-called Democratic
leaders were opposed to the annexation of Hawaii
and allowed the Republicans to take up the Demo
cratic policy of expansion and gain by so doing in
power and popularity. The war to help the Cubans
in their fight for freedom was a Democratic pto
gramme. Yet the war was no sooner begun than the
Democratic leaders, moved by some motive too small
to be determined without the aid of a moral micro
scope, arrayed their followers in petty opposition to
the conduct of the war and to the natural results of
the war.
"Enough of these absurdities; enough of these lead
; ers who compel a Democrat to vote the Republican
; ticket in order to further Democratic doctrines.
! Hawaii has been annexed. The Philippines will be
I acquired. The country shall develop and expand.
j Let the Democrats ceise to resist a Democratic policy
of expansion and plan for the development of the
| country and government of the new territory on
Democratic principles."
in Mr. Bryan's book. "The First Battle," Mrs.
j Bryan has this sentimental description of her husband
' as she fell in love with him:
"He was neatly though not fastidiously dressed, and
| stood firmly and with dignity. I noted particularly
his hair and his smile. The former, black in color,
fine in quality and parted distressingly straight; the
: letter expansive and expressive. In later years this
j smile has been the subject of considerable comment,
j but the well-rounded cheeks of Mr. Bryan how check
I its onward march and no one has seen the real breadth
of the smile who did not see it in the early days."
And more's the pity. It woulcT be worth seeing
j when its owner smiles at Hearst's present denuncia
! tions of expansion.

THE naval parade committee has
completed all arrangements for the
|| feature it will present during the
celebration. The water front will be
illuminated by 1600 Japanese lanterns.
There will be thousands of yards of bunt
ing, and during the night red lire will be
burned on a number of the wharves be
tween Harrison and Lombard streets. The
committee also has in mind the burning
of red fire from the summit of Telegraph
Hill. The parade, which takes place Sat
urday night, will be started by a signal
gun fired aboard the Marion. The steamer
Caroline will lead. Then will come the
committee tug Sea Queen, tugs with
schooners in tow, gasoline schooners, gas
oline and steam launches, steam schoon
ers, river steamers and ferry-boats, all
illuminated and decorated. The tugs Red
mond and Transit and tho launch Doll
will be used as dispatch boats. There will
be a grand display of fireworks and the
finale will be the burning of a barge do
nated by Captain Frcese This will be
altered to represent a two-funnel steamer
and will be loaded with charges of powder,
red fire and bombs, all to be set off auto
matically by means of slow matches so
timed as to have a continuation of explo
sions and effects. The last of it will be
the conversion of the barge, into a huge
bonfire.
Every ship captain in port is racking
his brains for some .new device by
which, he can win the bear flag offered
by the -Native Sons committee as a pre
mium for the best decorated ship. The
captains of the ship Emily Reed and Para
meta are working like beavers to have
their vessels in great shapt* On the Emily
Reed 1000 lights will be shown at night,
while during the day the yards and masts
of the vessel will hardly be seen for bunt
ing. If the Emily Reed does not win the
champion flag it will not be the fault of
the captain and crew. ,â
The press committee will view the pa
rade from the river steamer Onisbo and
all arrangements have been made for
their comfort. . The Cosmos Club goes out
on the Grace Barton, and a delegation 500
strong Is coming from Fresno and will
probably go out on the Sunol. The Stock
ton delegation will hold the H. J. Corco
ran for four days, while the Napa boys
will come down on the Zinfandel.
In addition to these steamers tho follow
ing will take part in the parade: Sausa
lito. Garden City. Amador, Herald, T. C.
"Walker. Mary Garratt, I^eader. Dauntless,
Resolute. Gold and F. M. Smith.
The majority of these vessels are being
I secured by private parties, but many of
I them will be open to the general public.
Ohipf Wharfinger Henderson and his as
sistants are besieged with pe<<j>le anxious
to get tickets for the night on the bay.
The headquarters of the N.ative^ons will
instruct all and sundry as. to where they
can secure tickets.
National I'arlor is going to take a. very
important part in the celebration. There
will be about 175 members in the parade,
led by a military band, and as nearly all
the members have served in the National
Guard they should make a line showing.
They will wear a black uniform with gold
facings, which will star.d out prominently
against the great number of uniforms of
light material. The parlor has engaged
the Techau auditorium as headquarters,
f.nd will entertain their guests in their
usual hospitable style. Their programme
is cs follows: Friday, September 7, night
at home for members and their families:
Sunday, September 9, sacred concert at 2
p. m. to general public; Monday, Septem
ber 10, reception and dancing at 2 p. m.
and 8 p. m.. to which the general public
is also invited, and Tuesday, September
11, at 8:30 p. m., grand ball by special in
vitation. Refreshments will be served on
all occasions.
A distinctive addition to the features of
the coming celebration will be the efforts
of Stanford Parlor No. 76, which has al
ways been noted for the enthusiasm with
which it has taken part in every celebra
tion of the State's Historical events and
the lavishness with which it has at all
times entertained its friends. It expects
to outdo itself this time in the splendor
of its decorations, the excellence of its
entertainment and the generosity of its
hospitality. The parlor will spend about
JCOOO during the celebration in taking a
fitting part in the general celebration and
entertaining its friends, and under the
able leadership of its chairman, Henry S.
Martin, expects to add a new chapter to
the history of the parlor. It has secured
Golden Gate Hall for its headquarters,
where the members will be at home. A.
P. Schlelcher. a member of the parlor, has
undertaken the decorations, which he
promises will be most artistic, consisting
mostly of electrical effects. The members
of the parlor have obtained new uniforms
of the navy fatigue pattern and have also
new flags and banners and a most elab
orate badge. The Veteran Guard of the
Grand Army of the Republic, Captain Jo
seph Knowlton. will escort the parlor.

Brinker made a host of friends here.
He was a Southerner, having been bdrn In
New Orleans thirty-three years ago, and
was endowed with all those courtly and
graceful manners that distinguish men
reared in the South.
Deceased was stopping In New York at
the time of his death, making arrange
ments to secure actors for his company
In Newark, where he was starring. After
attending to his business he went to the
hotel and was assigned to a room. Early
the next morning his body was found life
less at the bottom of an air shaft, upon
which his window opened. It Is supposed
that during the night he endeavored to
obtain relief from the stifling heat by sit
ting beside the open window, and that
upon going to sleep in his chair he lost
his balance and fell.
The actor had been worried for some
time lately over a small cancer that ap
peared to be growing on his breast, but
he was assured by his physician that it
could be easily cured. When last seen he
was In excellent spirits over this news
and happy In the prospects of the coming
season.
Brlnker's wife. Una Abell, to whom he
had been married only little more than a
year, came from Newark and took charge
of the remains. The deceased was in
terred at Apple Grove, Ohio, the summer
home of the dead player's father.
THE many friends and admirers of H.
Coulter Brinker, the popular actor
who filled a long pngasrement in this
city in 1S05-P6, will be shocked to hear
that he was accidentally killed re

in the Munich gallery, one of his early
works. That he had not wholly outgrown
his master, however, is shown In the thin
painting, the hard handling, the painful
minuteness of detail; but. on the other
hand, the modeling is skillful, the color
subdued and warm, the effect broad and
lifelike. There is an unpleasant hint of
aggressive self-conceit In the heafl. and
the likenesses that Durer painted of him
self when age had somewhat toned down
his complacency will be found more at
tractive In expression. Durer's method is
Illustrated by still later examples of por
traiture in Munich, where his skill in
microscopic detail is carried to the ex
tremest limits of finish. His portrait of
the once-famous Burgomaster Holzschu
her of Xuremburg was bought by the Ber
lin museum for about $93.000â then th^
largest price- ever paid for a portrait, and
one of the largest ever paid for any paint
ing up to that time. To appreciate tho
great advance that Durer made over his
predecessors, and especially his angular
master. Wohlgemuth. It is necessary to
observe onlv the first work that comes to
us from his hand, while his mature efforts
are such that one would hardly suppose
them/to belong to the same school. That
work, which is at once most profound in
thought and accomplished in teehniiue. 13
the double picture painted for the council
hall of Nuremburg, and known as "The
Four Temperaments." The figures repre
sent the Apostles John. Peter. Mark and
Paul: from their location in the ancient
hall of justice they are thought to have
had a legal as well as a religious signi
ficance. John may be taken as represent
ing Mercy: Teter. Justice; Paul, Argu
ment, and Mark, the Recorder. Whatever
may have been Durer's idea, it is easy to
see" in his work a complete abandonment
of former traditions in religious painting.
When these figures were produced Durer
had become an adherent of the principles
of tho reformation, and we may regard
them as a confession of hi* new faith.
The work la certainly superior In breadth
and beauty to anything he had before at
tempted. Perhaps the greatest religious
work that Durer ever created is "The
Trinity. Surrounded by Angels. Prophets
and Apostles, and Adored by Saints."
which belongs to the Belvedere gallery In
Vienna. In largeness of idea, force of de
sign and elaborateness of workmanship
It Is a very remarkable work, with some
passages of charming color, and showing,
blended with the stiffness from which
Durer never entirely escaped, that airi
ness and sense of grace which mark the
jri^tat Italian painters" works. Durer's
Italian travels gave him but little of this
quality, but, on the other hand, the Ital
ians caught from Durer many ideas which
gave strength to their art and imparted
to its grace a substantial character.
SHOCKING END OF
COULTER BfclNKER
Actor Well Known Here
Accidentally Killed
in New York.
To obtain a fair idea of the German
school of art the student must not only
become familiar with the great museums
of Berlin. Munich and Dresden, but it
would be well also to seek the home of
Albert Durer, the greatest of all the Ger
man artistsâ Nuremburgâ perhaps the
most fascinating town in Germany, and
certainly the quaintest. Durer, born in
1741. when Nuremburg was at the acme
of its commercial and political glory,
made his first essays In art under the
teaching of Wohlgemuth. whose style
seems to us now Incredibly hard and un
sympathetic, reflecting in Us stolid and
emotionless types of character the heart
less, cruel and brutal spirit of the middle
ages. Durer freed himself almost entire
ly from this style, thanks to his superior
force of character and his intelligence.
How much he surpassed his teacher is
demonstrated by the portrait of himself
VI.
(Concluded.)
The younger Hnlheln was especially
noted as a portraitist, and In this special
line he even pxrelled Durer. The portrait
of George Gvzen. a prominent English
merchant of Holbein's day. in thÂ» British
gallery is beautifully painted, with grear
attention to iletail and with a breadth of
comprehension that unites the whol<Â».
Above the attractive realism of glas*
vase, soft dra.pt-ry. crisp paper and rich
dress of velvet and silk the strong, intel
lectual face is dominant â not by any su
periority of workmanship nor by any
force of expression, for the features are
in pftrfect repose, but by the exact, calm
and entire truth to the facts of life, the In
tegrity of the drawing 1 , the dispassionate
and thorough statement of realities. Thus
was Holbein's art of portraiture great.
th<Â» greatest of Germany, in his absolute
and literal truth. His power was trm
power of description, not the power of
creation or insight or Imagination. He Is
one. of the first of portrait painters, nev
prtbeless. Thus his best achievements ar^
portraits, which make relatively slight de
mands upon the imagination; and to this
class of works belongs even his master
piece, the "Madonna qf th*Â» Burgomaster
Meyer Family." Two versions of this
work existâ one in Dresden, the other in
the royal palace at Darmstadt. Much dis
cussion has been held upon these pictures,
and the general opinion seems to be that
the one at Darmstadt is the original and
that at Dresden a copyâ which opinion
has no other ground than that the Darm
stadt picture Is In a bad condition of pres
ervation, being smoky, cracked and dim.
whereas the Drerden picture is in compar
atively good condition. The work shows
Holhein's strength and weakness â his
strength In the excellence of the portraits,
his weakness In the only bit of idealism
in the pictureâ the face of the Virgin,
which is quite devoid of expression. ThÂ»
meaning of thÂ»Â» work Is obscure, but it
seems to hav? been ordered hy the Meyer
family as a votive offering to the Virgin
for restoring a sick child to healthâ the
child bflng twice depicted in the composi
tion. Most of Holbein's work was drm*
In the service of the Kngllsh monarch
Henry VIII. whoso devotion to the holy
state of matrimony is so well known. Hol
bein painted him repeatedly, and also all
his Queens. His likenesses of Henry VIII
are familiar to all. and they are possibly
as valuable and trustworthy contributions
to history as anything that has ever been
written about him. Holbein's art is ad
mirably adapted to thÂ« description of his
torical personages, where unalloyed and
sterling truth to fact is all-essential and
nothing more is desirable or pertinent.
WILLIAM HOWE DOWNE3.
Boston. Mass.
Northern Italy felt hi3 power, and even
such a genius as Titian did not disdain
to show in many of his works his Indebt
edness to the German master. Few men
have exercised a wider Influence upon
European art than Durer.
Lucas Cranach, the painter of the cele
brated picture of "Christ and the Woman
Taken in Adultery," was Durer's meat
promising pupil, but a very feeble painter
compared with Durer. The countenance
of Christ Is of some beauty, but in other
regards the work la chiefly remarkable
as an elaborate failure In the expression
of emotion. The description of the sin
ner is amusing not only on account of her
medieval German dress but because, the
artist has made her so unconcerned ami
Inexpressive in just the degree that he
has evidently tried to make her seem con
trite and depressed. Cranach did not con
fine himself to religious painting; he cul
tivated the nude also, and essayed tho it
lustration of classical fable, for which ha
had not the slightest qualification. Ha
had a way of depicting Venus entirely
nude save for a wide brim velvet hatâ
which may have been retained as a deli
cate tribute to propriety. Cranach has
also left us some Interesting portraits of
Ivutherâ almost the only authentic ones
we have of the great reformer.
Hans Holbein the younger may ba re
parded as somewhat outside the general
field of German art. for his style was his
own. and neither took from nor added to
the ordinary practice of the school. All
his life, after the age of ?3, was spent in
England, where no art worth mentioning
then existed and where he was left
equally without guidance or control. Hi3
was a mind akin in original force to
Durer's, as is shown even in his earlier
works, such as the altarpiece representing
"The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian" In tho
Munich Gallery- The central panel sug
gests something of h's father's quaint
grotesqueness, but the figures of St. Eliz
abeth and St. Catherine r-how the Influ
ence of a spirit that could never have been
contented with the dry methods of the
paternal studio. This picture has a sin
gular interest as illustrating an almost
forgotten feud between the inhabitants of
Augsburg and Bavaria. Blue and -whlto
were then, as now. the colors of the Ba
varians, and these colors are worn by the
soldier who is winding up his crossbow
.in the foreground. The Holbeins were of
Augsburg, and whenever they painted a
Judas, a soldier scourging Christ, or one.
an here, prominent In the slaying of a
Christian martyr, they would Invariably
clothe that scoundrel in blue and white
striped breeches.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
judgment of the lower court In the case
of Reclamation District No. 108 against
W. II. West. The action was brought to
compel West to pay an assessment levied
on his land in 189G for reclamation pur
poses. Judgment went to the plaintiff, de
claring the same to be a Hen on the land.
It was directed that the land be sold to
satisfy the lien. West's land received lit
tle or no benefit and he refused to pay
the assessment levied because he received
no benefit. The Supreme Court holds that
the assessment must be proportionate,
and for this reason the judgment was re
versed.
Benefits Were Not Equal.

Skaguay, brings details of the lire that
ten days ago wiped out the larger portion
of Atlin City, and In battling which even
clergymen enlisted as fire lighters. The
blaze originated in the British America
corporation's large warehouse at the
head of First street. The bucket brigade
of citizens were powerless to check the
flames in this building, and so directed
their attention tg adjacent buildings, but
here also their efforts were futile. The
south wind which prevailed at the time
carried the fire across the street to the
store of J. H. Ross. From there It spread
to the O. K. restaurant and soon the large
grocery store owned by A. Nickerson was
burning llercely. The fire was now rag
ing on both sides of First street for the
whole lensrth of one block, besides the
buildings mentioned, many tents and cab
ins belnp consumed.
The bucket brigade was fighting hard
and successfully to save two large de
tached buildings, one at each end of the
fire â at the east end the Merchants' Bank
of Halifax and at the west the Olympic
Hotel. Both buildings were kept contin
ually dreQched with water, and wet blan

buildings nearest the fire. Several times
these soaking blankets were ignited by

Los Angeles, Cal.NEW YORK. Sept. 4.â The fever in American
Sugar Refining stocks which had be^n under
going a process of careful nursing for several
weeks past broke Into a crisis to-day, as Is
not urupual on the eve of dividend action in
this stock. For several Â¦weeks there was ex
trnslvo buying of Sugar stocks, but the manip
ulation to advance the price which accom
panied the buying aroused the suspicions of
the sapient proferÂ«ionals. When the stock be
pan to drop the professionals congratulate.;
themselves upon their foresight and became
eager operators on the short side of Sugar.
The apparent liquidation of long stock an!
the courageous pressure by the bears continued
this morning until the directors went Into ses
sion, about which time the stock touched the
low point at ll"'-i. After the adjournment of
the directors at 12:20 o'clock there was a rumor
that the directors had determined to put the
stock on an annual dividend basis of S per
cent by declaring a quarterly dividend of 1
per cent to-day. No official announcement of
the directors' action could be obtained, the
meeting having been adjourned to 3:30'o" clock,
or until after business had ceased upon ths
Stock Exchange. Hut the unfortunate shorts
were evidently well satisfied that the report
was well founded and they ran the stock up
S'-i points with their eager demands tor 10i>j
and y*~Q share lots. The price Kagged oft a
point, but stiffened atrain to about the beat
at the close. This buoyant rise in - Sugar
helped some or the other i=:iecialtles whlcn
had been under pressure In the morning, the
early declines In Brooklyn Transit, Manhattan
an<3 Metropolitan being more than recovered.
People's Gas recovered a point oÂ£ its i'j-pollit
break, but fell away again In the final deal
ings. The railroad list as a whole was neg
lected. Great Northern preferred, however,
rope I3i.
Bonds -were not active, but were slightly
flrrner in tone. Total sales, par. value, 1550,000.
United States 5s (registered) advanced Hi"
the bid price.
At the flnst call prices Jumped up E@1C points,
with the market Irregular , and excited. Â¦Â¦ Still
later the advance . was Increased . to ; a > matter
of E@7 points . by . a , efcurt of general Â» buying
led by room traders. .The weekly, Government
report showed less pessimistic â¢ than figured
upon and led to quite a 6cramble f. of ' profli

The leading futures ranged as follows
CHICAGO, Sept. 4.â There were spurts of
activity In wheat, but taken as a whole the
session was dull, generally exhibiting a tone
of weakness. October opened %c down tc Hike
and on a bit of local buying at the start ad
vanced to 75V&C. Liverpool was easy and the
world's shipments larger-6.176.n00 bushels. Re
ceipts looked enormous, although it was gen
erally believed that many of the report* were
duplicates or even triplicates jumbled up dur
ing the holidays. The outside was doing but
little and as looal people were selling October
during the forenoon it dropped to 74%c. The
close was weak. October l@l^Â»c lower at 74HO 1
7 4 He.
The corn market Buttered from liquidation
by local longs. Country offerings were still
light and cables were steady. Trade was quiet.
October closed weak, %@%C down, at .IS^ic.
Oats were dull and easy In sympathy with
corn. October closed Vbc lower at 2iv;c.
Provisions were firm, but trade was restricted
largely to a cash basis. The market for
futures opened higher because of light hog
receipts, higher prices at the yards and a
good cash demand. Fluctuations were nar
row, but the close found some of the bulKe
had held. October pork closed 2Hc higher,
lard 2'4<g5c better and ribs 2V2<55c improved.

many places the yield Is reported nearly up to
the average; all varieties are said â¢ to - bs - of
Kc-osl quality. Raisin curing and 'Wine making
are in progress. Peara. plums and nectarines

NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â Failures in the United
States for the calendar month of August, as
reported by telegraph to Bradstreefs, number
705, with aggregated liabilities of $6,235,052 and
assets of $2,936,847. In number the failures are
the fewest reported in any month for eleven
months past, and the same is true of the lia
bilities. Comparisons of the number of failures
nnd the liabilities with August' a year ago are
not so favorable, there being 30, or 4.4 per cent,
more failures than a year ago In August, while
liabilities are 5S per cent larger and assets 36.2
per cent heavier. If the record for last August
ls omitted, however, and comparison is made
with the same month of preceding years, the
business mortality of August this year will
be seen to have been well below the normal.

.\. L. .Maun, wno has beon eiecied presi

has another iÂ»lan by which the associa
tion's coffers may be tilled, concerning
which be said last night: "There is really
no nee<1 for this shortage in the associa
tion's treasury when a simple plan would
replenish it. The Board of Education has
paksed warrants amounting to $Sv> &\ this

but when the warrants were turned over
to the Auditor he refused to sign them,
stating that the affair was merely a mat
ter of transfer from one department of
the pchr.nl management to another. We
eNpect To-morrow that the board will again
pass a resolution allowing us the use of
this sum and if we can make this a per
manent thing there can exist no doubt but
that v.o can bring the annuities up to their
old figure."
The Teachers' Annuity Association has
reorganized on a stronger hasis. The
orlgnal organization was a voluntary af
fair, without a board of directors, and as
a consequent e lacked that unity In which,
the teachers feel; lies strength. Last Fri
day therefore the former Teachers' Annu
ity Society w.is declared defunct and the
following: named were elected to form a

The new society's objects as outlined in
the constitution are twofoldâ to supple
ment the rcluied annuities of retired
teachers now members of the society, and
to secure favorable legislation as to the
increase of tho present maximum annuity.
Heretofore the maximum annuity was
fixed at $30 per month, but the law rro
\i<ies ttoat when the funds of the associa
tion arc low ihÂ«Â» amount of the annuity
5hall decrease proportionately. In ac
cordance with this statute the maximum
nuc has of lato been reduced to $2."> per

STORMS' DEATH
TO BE CLOSELY
INQUIRED INTO
"What we want in this matter," said
Attorney Fitzgerald, "is to ascertain what
has become, of this property. We want
Wakeman removed, not released, as trus
tee because he is an unlit and improper
person to handle the property of this in
competent."
In behalf of Wakeman, Attorney Mc-
Pike claimed that his client acted honor
ably toward Lady Ynrde-Buller in the
handling of her estate, and that the deed
of trust under which he held her prop
erty provided that the income should be
paid to her instead of to the guardian.
"That is a matter for the court to han
dle, not Mr. Wakeman. You had no right
to stop payments to the guardian simply
because you wore told that Greenebaum
was not doing his duty," declared Judge
Greene.
E. IL Wakeman was then put on the
stand to explain what he had done with
the Income from the estate. He said that
since September 1. 1899, he had received
$4500. all of which he expended in behalf
of Lady Yarde-Buller. The greater por
tion went for taxes and Interest on mort
gages. About $12i\) was pnid to W B
Greenehaum for the lady's maintenance
On this showing. Judge Greene dis
missed the citation against Wakeman.
where she took off her valuable sealskin
sacque and handing it over the counter
said, 'Give me ?1 50 on this." With the
money she came to Oakland and hunted
me up. She told me about the coat and
I agreed to go with her to redeem it. We
hunted for hours and finally found the
little "chophouse' where she left the furs.
The man we wanted was not there and It
necessitated further search to find him.
When we did, he wanted $10. I had but
$9 50 and refused to meet the man's de
mands. Lady Yarde-Buller then knocked
my purse from my hands and scattered
the money all over the table. Scooping
It into a pile she gave it nil to the fellow,
and at the same time told him he could
have $50 more if he wanted it. With that
she took a piece of paper and made an
order on me for the fifty. Of course I
paid no attention to it. That is how it
cost $10 to" redeem the sealskin coat."
Guardian Greenebaxim then explained
how he paid $12T> a month for six months
for Lady Ynrde-BuUer's board and lodg
ing at A Mon Chateau, and how he re
fused to allow a $47 claim for wine and
other beverages furnished by mine host
Gruggel.
As Greenebaum had filed no account
since last December, Judge Greene or
dered him to present onÂ« immediately.
"Did you ever advance money on any
of Lady Yarde-Buller's jewelry?" ques
tioned McPike.
"Never," answered the guardian.
Attorney Fitzgerald made a scathing
arraignment of Wakrman, declaring that
the latter had squandered $00,000 of Lady
Yarde-Buller's estate in an unlucky ven
ture as a bookmaker at the Emeryville
racetrack. He declared that Wakeman
had deceived Judge Bahrs of San Fran
cisco In the transfer of the trust estate
to William H. Chapman.' no statement
being made in court relative to Lady
Yarde-Buller's incompetency or to the
condition of her estate.
OAKLAND, Sept. 4.â Lady Leilah
Kirkham Yarde-Buller used to
treat her guardian and then make
him pay the bills. When she did
not have the money and could not get It
from her guardian she would deposit her
sealskin sacque as security for the. dinner
and make her guardian redeem the gar
ment.
The?e and many other peculiarities of
her ladyship were brought out to-day at
an examination before Judge Greene of
the Superior Court, wherein W.B. Greene
baum, the guardian of her ladyship, had
cited E. H. Wakeman, who holds her
ladyship's estate in trust, to show why
Wakeman did not turn over to him the in
come from her ladyship's estate. Inci
dentally Trustee Wakeman came in. for a
roast from Attorney Fitzgerald, who la
lighting him.
Before the matter was concluded It re
solved itself into an examination of
Greenebaum by Henry C. McPike, who
represented Wakeman. McPike wanted
to know all about how Greenebaum had
treated I-ady Yarde-Buller, and Greene
baum replied that he had not treated her.
but that f!io had treated him and made
him pay the bills.
"I was compelled to drink," said Greene
baum. "I had to keep the woman quiet.
She would ring the bell, order 'two whis
kies,' and when the liquor appeared she
made me drink. If I showed signs of re
fusal she would get excited and threaten
to create a scene."
"Did you always drink whisky?" asked
McPike.
"Ye?, always," answered the guardian.
"I am not a drinking man. but I was com
pelled to sip my whisky to avoid trouble.
It went against my grain, but I had to
do it"
"Did you ever dine at the chateau with
Lady Yarde-Ruller?" asked McPike.
" I did once." replied Greenebaum. "And
I paid for the dinner. That was the only
meal I ever ate there with Lady Yarde-
Buller, though often invited by her after
ward. No. we never dined together at the
Malson Rlche in San Francisco."
Greenebaum was then given an oppor
tunity to explain how he had expended
moneys belonging to his charge. He sai.i
that since his appointment a year ago he
received in all about $1700, all of which he
paid out for the maintenance of Lady
Yarde-Buller and her minor son, Arthur
K. Blair. Attorney McPike went into the
minutest details to show that his client,
E. II. Wakeman, had paid to Greenebaum
all of the income of the incompetent
woman's estate.
"How about this Item of $10 to redeem a
sealskin sacqiie pawned In San Fran
cisco?" McPike asked.
"It was pawned for $1 50 to a Third
street restaurant man," said Greenebaum,
"and It will require a long story to ex
plain why it cost $10 to redeem it. "While
Lady Yarde-Buller was staying across the
bay she suddenly took a notion to come
to Oakland. She had no money, not even
car fare, and went into a restaurant

Walter A. Haas on one side and Frank
Finlayson on the other this morning ap
peared before Judge Fitzgerald prepared
to argue the recent action of the Police
Commissioners In suspending the licenses
of sixty-nine saloons.
The case came up before Judge Fitzger
ald upon the request of Al Levy in behalf
of the Liquor Dcalsrs' Association for an
injunct:on restraining the Board of Police
Commissioners from annulling his liquor
license because of Ms refusal to obey the
board'3 order for the removal of private
boxes.
Frank Flnlayson, who represents tho
liquor dealers, has associated with him
Stephen M. White, A. W. Hutton, M. K.
Young and S. V. Landt, who also repre
sent tho interested property owners.
Judgo Fitzgerald during the course of
the proceedings stated that the question,
in his mind, wns whether, after having
granted a license, the board had a right
arbitrarily to revoke the license without
giving notice and opportunity of hearing.
Tho City Attorney quott'd the section of
the ordinanco which gives the board
power to issue and to revoke a license if
the cause is sufficient.
In his demurrer Air. Haas contends that
the complaint contains no allegation that
the Chief has closed or will close the place
in question. :â¢.Â¦ '"

SAN JOSE, Sept. 4.â There promise to

city printing for a year at $200 per month
ShortrMge hypothecated the contract to
Fj. C. Singletary for the entire year.
Now the creditors who took charge of the
paper a couple of weeks ago have notified
the Council that all bills for city printing
must be paid to them. The matter was
discussed at the Council meeting to-day.
It was announced that the city would pay
no bills until the work was done; that
when a bill was presented it would be
acted upon. The question of the legality
of such hypothecation came up. All
claims must be sworn to before being pre

a tangle for the city to worry over. The

C ;HERE is joy in the headquarters
of the Republican State Central
commitne j n the Palace Hotel.
|^ There is a beam of satisfaction on
the faces of officers, employes and
visitors alike and a peace reigns in the
place whore the noise of rows and the
importuning of angry creditors afflicted
Th t Â» mrf. Th<? cause of the welcome
char.pe is the withdrawal of Edward C.
Conroy and his private annoyance from
the corr.mi'.'.ff* rooms. Everybody knows
Edward C. Conroy.
â¢'I"thicrs. who want their money, know
him. Men, who shudder at the sad recol
lf-cT'on of the "rush act and a quick
touch." know him. Money brokers, who
ECent interest in the air and llnd expert
(rw. know him. Hotel-keepers, who
glance woefully at their profit and loss ac
count, know him. Gamblers, who lend a
pitying Â«ar to a hard luck story, know
him. The shrewd. i>t-rsistt?nt ana pug
nacious rei>rc-^Â«ntatives of collection
agencies know him and his haunts, and
that is why the Republican State Central
Committee, individually and collectively,
i.-- glad that he is gene.
For the truth mut-t be told; Edward C.
Conroy does n->t pay his bills and thÂ«?
vail of the unpaid has sounded loud and
long in the rooms of the Republican State
Centra! Committee. Searching eyt-s have
peered into the ro.ims looking for the Con
r<-y form. Boisterous voices have sounded
urÂ«'uj.d the Conroy presence and greaticu
laiing CtXM have made uppercuts at the
Conroy nose until patience, on the part
of the JÂ»tatÂ»* Central Committee, has
t *â¢:<?-â¢ Â¦! to be a virtue.
Conroy's personal affairs began to be a
matter of serious moment to his asso
Â¦ - when he assumed to be a sc-lf-creat
ed general manager of the Il(j>u!ilican
Stale Central Committee. By what au
thoritjr he did so is hidden in his inner
consciousness. That he was the factotum
r.T'l persona! attendant of Dan Hums
while that worthy was in the citv was no
membered and his scandal became a re- i
flection upon the committee. When he <
sought and failed to secure a certificate Â¦
of character from the Grand Jury, which !
had made him a subject of inquiry, mem- ;
j brrs of the State Central Committee were !
! of the opinion that no harm would be done Â¦
! if he were less in evidence at the head- \
quarters.
But when his creditors began to flock to j
the State Committee headquarters to
j shout their demands and to make threats
j of dire vengeance if unpaid bills were not :
j satislied thru the State Committee re- j
belled. Conroy had been trailed all over :
town and in the State Committee rooms I
I the creditors' wars were waged. The mak- ;
j ors of tine raiment were there demanding ;
I that Conroy pay for his clothes. Money i
j lenders came with savage demands. Rep- '
resentativos of collection agencies trooped J
Â¦ In and threatened to hold the State Com- ;
1 rr.ittee itself responsible if they were not '

[ And then Conroy was gently led to un- 'Â¦
I derstand that he was wanted elsewhere 'Â¦
j and he removed himself from the head- j
I quarters, where he served no purpose ex- I
I ccpt to act as the personal representative i
of Mexican Dan and as the horrible ex- J
ample of the elusive debtor. Among those !
who would like to see him establish an- I
other l')uiiKingr place where they may meet ?
j him are Harris, the tailor; William A. j
! Kelly, the Market-street druggist; P. '
! Gruhn, the money lender: Joe Harvey, the j
I pool seller, and anybody with authority i
j to collect a bill for the Lick House.

I Central Committee. Is a tender-hearted j
! man. and is inclined to be charitable in ;
] ppoaklng of the ousting of Conroy.
"I let Conroy out because there was no !
! work for him' to do." he said. "Dan
â¢ Hums sent over and asked If there was
j not something that he could do; said that
Conroy was not able, on his salary of J
! $100 per month, to pret along. 1 did not see i
j thon that there was anything for him to ;
drt. but we expected that some literature !
I would be along soon to distrihute, and so j
j I i>ut him on. While lie was here he i
I held no official position. He had no liter- i
j ature to handle. He was not secretary j
! nor assistant secretary. He did whatever :
j v:e told him to do. I dismissed him when ,
J I found that there was no work for him. I
1 never knew anything about his creditors '
until he had born paid off last Saturday j
I afternoon and had gone away. Then a
man cam" in and asked that Conroy's pay '
j should be hold out for a debt. No one I
I el.-e hns ever been here to say anything ;
I about Conroy's debts, so far a<Â» I know. I :
i have told Conroy that I would take him }
| Lack whÂ«n there was any work for him
I to do."
Will H. Holcomb of San Diego, candi
date for the Democratic nomination for
Congress in the Seventh Congressional
District, was in San Francisco yesterday
and will leave for San Jose to-day.
The Iroquois braves will attend the
State Convention of Democrats. The train
leaving San Francisco at 9 a. m. to-mor
row will carry the warriors to the council
of statesmen.
A large field of aspirants is presented in
the Seventh District. The chances seem
to favor YV. D. Crichton of Fresno, who
has th* indorsement of several valley
delegates. C. II. Castle of Merced and L.
J. Madduc of Modesto and Will II. IIol
enmb of San Diego are in the field.
Word enmes from the south that Ste
phen M. White has espoused the candl
dacv for Congress of W. A. Spaulding in
the Sixth District. W. C. Graves of San
Luis Obispo has friends in the district
who will not be idle at Ran Jose.
Leading Democrats of the Fifth District
have been trying to persuade James V.
Coleman or J. Downey Harvey to accept
a nomination for Congress, but success
has not attended the effort. H. C. Ges
ford, ex-State Senator, has many sup
porters.
In the Second District the leading aspir
ants are Joseph Sproul of Chico, A. Cam-
Snetti of Amador and F. R. Nichols of San
Jfiaquin.
In the Third District, Edwin Swlnford
of Colusa and Burdette Cornell of Oakland
are spoken of as candidates.
The Fourth District is mixed. Mayor
Fhelan is favorable to the nomination of
Judge Coffey. It was supposed that the
honor of leading the Democrats of the
Fourth would be accorded to Senator H.
Porter Ashe. but the Mayor ruled other
wise. Senator Ashe, however, takes His
medicine without a murmur.
The Democrats appear to have no pro
gramme for the Electoral ticket. Among
men mentioned for Electors at large are
Stephen M. White of Los Angeles; Jasper
McDonald, San Francisco; D. M. Delmae,
Fanta Clara; John Haynes, Humboldt,
and J. W. Martin, Tulare. Among the
District Electors spoken of are Cornelius
Shea. Santa Rosa; A. B. Sanford, Ukiah;
William R. Jacobs, Stockton; Dr. W. C.
Prather, Lake County; Charles Edelman,
San Francisco: J. H. Henry, San Jose; T.
A. Rice, Ventura, and J. J. Hanford, San
Bernardino.
The greatest interest attaches to the
Congressional ticket. In the First dis
trict It la said that the leading candidates
are James Cochrane of San Rafael and
Emmet Seawell of Santa Rosa. Kfforts
are making to persuade ex-State Senator
J. H. Seawell of Mendoclno to enter the
race.
The advance guard of Democratic dele
pates to the State convention will leave
Baa Francisco for San Jose this forenoon.
The afternoon trains will carry many
delegates to the convention city. J. C.
Sims (chairman) and Thomas E. Curran
Â¦ secretary) of the State Central Commit
tee will j?o to the front this forenoon and
establish headquarters in the St. James
Hotel, San Jose. The leaders of the party
