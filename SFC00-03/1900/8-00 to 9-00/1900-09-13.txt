SUMMARY WAY OF DEALING
WITH LOOTERS OF DEAD
BODIES.
TWO CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES
PLACE LOSS OF LIFE AT 2000
AL'STTN. Tex.. Sept. 12.â Governor Savers to-day made the following state
ment to the Associated Press correspondent on the Galveston flood Â«;'tua
tion:
"Conditions at GalveÂ«=ton are fully as bad as reported. Communica
tion has been re-established between the Island and the mainland, however, and
hereafter transportation of supplies will be less difficult. The work of clearing
the city is progressing fairly well, and Adjutant General Scurry, under direc
tion of the Mayor, is j>Â»trolHng the "city for the purpose of preventing depreda
t!ons. The most conservative estimate as to the number of deaths Is 2000. Con
tributions from citizens of this State and also from other States are coming In
rapidly and liberally, and it Is confidently exDeoted that within the next ten
<5ay* the work of restoration by the people of Galveston will have begun in good
ea.rr.est and with energy and success. Of course the destruction of property has
been very great, not less than J10.00Q.M0. but it is hoped and believed that even
this ereat loss will be overcome through the energy and self-reliance of the
people."
During the day the contributions have fairly deluged the Governor more
than flOO.000 having been received. Among the large contributors are to be noted
â¢.ho Standard Oil Company with $10,000. the St. Louis Commercial Club for a
Ike amount and the Huntlngton interests for $5000.
This afternoon Governor Sayers received the following offlclal report from

Governor Bayers to-day began receiving rer>orts from various nolnts Â»!ââ
the gulf coastn which would indicate that there has been great pronei-tv *n
dene for several hundred miles, and that the ltet of Galveston fatalities and siiT*
foring will be largely augmented. Down' the coast from Galveston the town of
Dickinson was laid waste and five people killed. The town of Alvin Alta 1,0m-,
Texas City and Brookshire are wrecked and hundreds are destitute. Rich *

City and Stafford, Just opposite, were entirely demolished and the few' people re
maining at those places have no homes to cover their heads. Bay City in Ma"
tagorda County. Is reported wrecked, with much loes of life, though no ofnVlni
report has been made to that effect. Patton, Rollover. Bolivar Point Quintan
Sugarland, Belleville, Wharton, Falrview, Missouri City, Sartartla, Arcola and
El Campo are also reported heavy sufferers, both In point of property, destroyed
and lives lost.
Owinir to the fact that telepraph service !s still badly crippled. Governor Say
rrn cannot ascertain the exact number of dead at the points named, but It Is ap
proximated at WX).
Reports reaching the Governor show that the railroads, telegraph and tele
phone companies have suffered an Immense loss by the storm. The Governor
wa? informed to-day that quite a number of tugs from New Orleans and other P
available points had either arrived or were en route to Galveston, and by Satur
day th* transportation problem would be solved Â»o far as getting people from the
island to the mainland was concerned.
Hundreds applied again to-day to Governor Sayers for permits to go to Gal
veston. but he refused all. saying that there were already too many people there
and in case of emergency the local managers of the relief corps were better ablÂ«
to act on their discretion than if dictated to by him. : .._-- "

"WASHINGTON. Sept. 12.â Tho Quarter
master's Department has received the fol
lowing from Galveston:
FORTIFICATIONS ARE
LOST BEYOND RECOVERY
"With regard to resumption of direct rail
communication with the Island no one can
tell when it will take place. The Santa
Fe, the Missouri. Kansas and Texas, the
International and Great Northern and the
Galveston, Houston and Henderson have>
decided to construct a temporary bridge
for joint use. and the Southern Pacific
may eventually join in the enterprise.
MHitla detachments have been sta
tioned at Texas City and Vlrglna Point
to prevent the passage of persons who
have no business in Galveston. Eighty
three bodies had been buried at Texas
City up to last night. All of these floated
In from the island. Probably 200 bodies
have been recovered and burled at Vir
ginia Point. -. - v
HOUSTON. Tex., Sept. 12.â Refugee*
continue to reach Texas City Junction
from Virginia Point, all telling harrowing
stories which vary only, in detail. The
situation appears worse as time pro
gresses. What is most needed Is means of
transportation across the bay to bring out
the homeless and destitute.
SOLDIERS TO KEEP OUT
IDLERS FROM GALVESTON
Mr. Van Vleck, manager of the South
ern Pacific Railroad, authorized the com
mittee to draw on the company for 15000.
Mr. Van Vlerk returned to Houston to
send a bargeload of supplies. The Gal
veston. Houston and Henderson Rallroadi
Is operating relief trains over Us line to
Texas City Junction and thence over the
Texas City Terminal to or nearly to
Texas City.
The situation In the city to-day is that
there are plenty of volunteers for this
service, but an insufficiency of arms.
There have been two or three small riots,
but the officers have managed to quell
them. The committee rejected the propo
sition of trying to pay for work, letting
the laborers secure their "own rations. It
was jdeclded to go ahead Impressing men
Into service. If necessary. Issuing orders
for rations only to those who worked or
were unable to work. All of the ward
chairmen reported the Imperative need of
disinfectants. A committee was appointed
to sequester all the disinfectants in the
city, including the lime which escaped
wetting, and to secure more. Jlouston
was called upon for a bargeload \f lime.
The relief committee was greatly encour
aged by the offer of the White Screwmen's
Association tendering the services of Its
50) members. They were placed at the
disposal of the various ward chairmen
and foremen appointed for each division.

The majority. of those men wete

the desecration of the dead. Some of
them were natives and some had been al
lowed to go over from the mainland under
the guise 'of "relief" workers. Not only
did they rob the dead, but they mutilated
bodies in order to secure their ghouli&b

were also stripped from the head in order
to get the jewelry. A few Government

have been- patrolling the city and/have
endeavored to prevent the robbing of tho

In the Bolivar Lighthouse, which stands
130 feet high on Bolivar Point, Across the
bay from Galveston, about 150 peoplt
sought refuge from the storm Saturday
evening. Many were unfortunates whose
homes had been swept by the hutricar^
and others residents of Galveston who
had come to the bay shore. In frnr.tic ef
forts to reach Galveston and their fam
ilies. The refugees spent an awful night |
in the litrhthnuso Saturday night. The
supply of fresh water wan soon exhausted
and an effort was. made to secure water
by catching rainwater In buckets sus
pended at the top of the* lighthouse. The
experiment was a success In a way, but
it demonstrated a remarkable incident of
the force of the wind. The bucket was
soon Oiled with water, but it was sally
and could not be, used. The salt watt r
spray was shot skyward over 130 feet and
mingled with the rain water that fell m
the .buckets. From" the top cf the light
tower several of the more venturesome
storm sufferers viewed the destructive
work of tho wind on Galveston Island.
Twelve- dead bodies were recovered near
the liphthor.se. '
Mr. Mutti. a storekeeper, lost his life
after n display of uncommon heroism.
Whr-n she storm surrek tho city he hitched
up a one-horpÂ« curt nnd started out to
rescue Ills neighbors. Cartload after cart
load he carried in safety to a fire company
house. On three-occasions the cartload of
! human beings, some half dead, others
crazed with fright, was carried for blocks
by the raging currents, but he landed all
of them saftly even to his last iead. when
he met his t'.eath. -As he attempted to
pass into tho building on his last trip the
firehoure succumbed to the wind and col
lapsed. ..Some of the wreckage struck
Mvtli and he was mortally Injured.
The official records of the United States
Weather Bureau give some valuable In
formation about the storm. Unfortunately
the recording instruments were destroyed
or crippled beyond operation about "5:1Q
o'clock Saturday evening. The wind gauge
recorded a two-rrilnute blow at the rate
of 100 miles an, hour and was then demol
ished by the hurricane, which continued
to increase In violence.
While the. exact velocity of the wind
was not recorded after the destruction of,
the Instruments, the Weather Bureau re
ports estimate* the maximum velocity nf
between 110 and 120 miles .in hour. It did
not maintain, this terrific rate for anv
length of timeâ perhaps, for half a min

People tell of retting out of their houses
just In the nick of time. They' tell of see-
Ing people struck by flying timbers and
crushed to death before their eyes. One
man was 'cut off from his family just as
he thought he had them rescued, and saw
them sink beneath the water on the other
side of a barrier. He turned in and
helped to rescue others who were In peril.'
One woman carried her live months old

Hundreds of Names Added to
the; Roll of Unfortunates
Who Lost Their Lives in
the Galveston Horror.
All Attempts to Bury the Dead
Abandoned and Safety of
the Living Now the Par
amount Question.
/ â \ ALVESTOX. Sept. 12,8 p. m., via Houston, midnight. â
\J{ All attempts at burving the dead have been utterly
abandoned, and bodies are now being disposed of in the
swiftest manner possible. Scores of them were buried to-day,
and hundreds were taken out to sea and thrown overboard. The
safety of the living is now the paramount question, and nothing
that may tend to prevent the outbreak of pestilence is being neg
lected. This morning it was found that large nunibers of bodies
which had been previously thrown into the bay washed back
upon the shore, and the situation was thus rendered worse than
before they were first taken in the barges and thrown into the
water.
It will now never be known how many have lost
their lives in this awful catastrophe. Mayor Jones
of Galveston thinks that the dead will amount to
7OOO and others whose opportunities for judging
are less than those of the Mayor place the number
as hi&h as 10.000.
Relief committees from the interior of the State have com
menced to arrive and, as usual, they are too large in numbers
and to a certain extent are in the way of the people of Galveston
arid an impediment to the prompt relief which they themselves
are so desirous of offering. Some of the relief expeditions have
had committees large enough to consume 10 per cent of the
provisions which they brought. The relief sent from Beaumont,
Texas, arrived this morning and was distributed as fast as pos
sible. It consisted of two carloads of ice and provisions. The
great trouble now seems to be that the people who are in
greatest need are the least likely to receive the aid. Mary of
them are so badly maimed and wounded that they are unable to
apply to the relief committee, and the committee are so over
whelmed by direct applications that they have been, unable to
fend out messengers.
The wounded everywhere are still needing the attention of
physicians, and despite every effort it is feared that a number
will die because of sheer impossibility to afford them the aid
necessary to save their lives. Every man in Galveston who is
able to walk and work is engaged in the work of relief with all
the energy of which he is capable. But despite their utmost
endeavors they cannot keep up with the increase of the miser
able conditions which surround them. Water can be obtained
by able-bodied men. but with great difficulty. Dr. Shaw of
Houston, who is busily engaged in the relief work, said to-night
that there were 200 people at St. Mary's Infirmary without wa
ter. They had been making coffee of salt water and using that
as their only beverage.

ers as to the time and manner of with
drawal, aceording fo the terms of the
note. ThÂ«Â« sending of further supplies to
him has hren stopped and he now awaits
but the signal from Washington to begin
his movement. It is for the President to
give that signal. ...
The considerations now before him be
fore immediate withdrawal 'are,' first, the
fact that he is already committed in a
measure to such course: second, it is rep
resented that China im on the verge of a
terrible famine and the retention of the
troops in Pekingr. preventing as they dp
the retprn of the Chinese Government
and the supply of provisions to the cap
ital, nlaces the responsibility ; for what
threatens to be a frightful calamity upon
the powers who sanctioned the occupa
tion. On the other hand, strong: repre
sentations have been made to the Presi
dent in opposition .to withdrawal, in ad
vance of ' the ' procurement of absolutely 1
mfHcipiit guarantees for the protection of
American interests in China and for the
safety of the native Christians. This lasl
condition ls one of the most difficult to
meet; but. being insisted upon by the'mis
t-ionary element, is being given most care

Hastening Negotiations.
In anticipation of some such state of
affairs, the effort has been made to hasten
the dispatch pf preliminary negotiations.
It Is highly desirable that some respon
sible representative of the CMnese Gov
ernment be recognized In order â¢ that we
may secure a sufficient guarantee upon
which to base the withdrawal, of our
troops. Ll Hung Chang and Prince Ching
are the only lights In the East. -so far as
our Government can see. and It is pos
sible that. the present problem: may be
solved, by'adecision to deal with 1 them im
mediately and to accept their pledge as
sufficient for our purposes. Therefore the
decision announced to-day to facilitate Li
Hung Chang's passage from Shanghai to
Peking may be regarded as significant.
Later it was announced that Consul Gen
eral Goodnow had reported that LI would
leave Shanghai next Friday for Tientsin.
His moans of transportation are not
known, but' he may have a United States
vessel if such a thing ls absolutely neces
sary to his reaching Tientsin. 'A Possibly
the negotiations may be conducted 1 there
but the opinion in official circles seems to
be that the last act In the negotiations

LONDON, Sept. 13. 3:15 a. mâ All the
correspondents in China are sending ter
rible' stories of wholesale massacres of
missionaries and native Christians. It Is
asserted that during July between 15,000
and 20.000 converts were massacred in the
northern provinces. : Large numbers of
missionaries are still unaccounted for and
small hope Is entertained of their escape.
Native reports are -subject to "the most
careful scrutiny, with the result that al
though there- may. be some exaggeration
it is impossible to doubt that in the main
they are correct. :
The horror is intensified by the con
firmation of the. reports that the women
were subjected to unspeakable barbarities
and tortures, being stripped and â¢ slowly
clubbed to death. This was one of the
mildest methods. The Boxers wreaked
fiendish vengeance. ' ..

perative that the dead should be got to
sea as soon as possible. Many of the
bodies taken out are unidentified. They
are placed on the barges as quickly as
possible and lists are made while the
barges are being towed to sea. A large
number of dead animals were hauled to
the bay and dumpeti in, to be carried to
sea by the tides.
One. hundred and twenty-five men work
ed all day yesterday and last night in un
covering the machinery of the water
works from the debris. It is hoped that
it will be possible to turn on the water
for a while to-day, and it la planned to
sel fire to the debris and cremate the
bodies burled under It.
Mayor Jones has given very full scope
to Chief of Police Ketchum and J. H.
Hawley, chairman of the committee on
public safety, to swear in citizens of good
j character as officers, and has told them
j that "able-bodied men must be made to
work or get off the Island. The city, he
said, was under martial law. Picket lines
have been established around the large
| stores and guards placed on duty. The
soldiers and police are instructed to shoot
any one caught looting or attempting to
loot. The Jails are full and summary
measures are necessary.
As the work of collecting bodies pro-
I ceeds and reports come In of deaths It
becomes apparent that the death list will
run much higher than was at first sup
posed. Conservative estimates place the
number of dead In the city at 5000. Other
points of the coast also suffered/ and re

was reported that the steamer Lawrence

QALVESTOX, Tex.. Sept. 11 (via
yacht Stella to Houston, Sept. 12).
âThe good people of Galveston
are stialning every nerve to clear
the ground and secure from beneath the
debris the bodies of human beings and j
animals and to get rid of them. It Is a |
task of grc*it magnitude and is attended I
with untold difficulties. There is a short- j
age of horses to haul the dead and there
is a shortage of willing hands to perform
the gruesome work. Yesterday morning
it became apparent that It would be im- I
possible to bury the dead in long trenches
and arrangements were 'made to take
them to sta. Barges and tugs were
quickly made ready for the purpose, but
it was difficult to get men to work. The
city's firemen worked hard in bringing I
bodies to the wharf, but outside of them
were few who helped. The work was In
the hands of Alderman C. M. McMaster,
Captain Charles Clark, James B. Hughes
and others. These men pitched in. hand- |
ling the bodies themselves and urging the
few men they could pick up to work.
Father Kirwin, who wont out to summon j
men for the work, reported that it was j
impossible to get any considerable num- J
her, and he urged that able-bodied men ;
be impressed. Soldiers and policemen j
were sent out and every able-bodied man
they found was marched to the wharf
front. The men were worked in relays
and were liberally but not too
supplied with stimulants to nerve them
for their task. At nightfall three barge
loads, containing about 700 human bodies,
had been sent to sea, where they were
sunk with weights. Darkness compelled
suspension of work until morning. To
ward nieht great difficulty was expe
rienced in handling bodies of negroes,
which are badly decomposed. The work
to-day will be still more difficult.

Colonel Li. J. Folk, general manager of

DALLAS, Tex.. Sept. 12.â Much se
ricus thought has been given to
the question of the future of Gal
veston by the best Informed men
of Dallas since the calamity of
last Saturday and Sunday. The outlook
to their minds is not a bright one. The
expression of judgment most frequently
heard is, "Galveston Is doomed." Men
reason that to the perils that the popula
tion have ever had to face from nature's
elements the timidity of capital must now
be addtd. In the great storm of 1S75 little
of private or public capital ran the risk of
destruction. The great wharves, eleva
tors, compressors and railway and steam
ship systems had taken but slight foot
hold in the island city. The Federal Gov
ernment had built jetties and general har
bor improvements and coast defenses at
a cost of more than $10,000,000 of public
money. All these miHions of public and
private wealth have been put into Gal
veston enterprises-slnce 1S75. Capitalists
will scarcely venture again In the near
future to invest their money in a place
where it is likely to be wiped out at >he
ratio of five to ten millions of dollars to
one equinoctial storm. - :'
And when the Federal Government con
templates the costly brand new coast de
fense fortifications such as Fort Sam
Houston shattered by wind and waves
and ninety per cent of the garrison killed
it will not consider the place where these
ventures were made safe for their dupli
cation. A harbor to be safe must be land
locked.
These are the views of thinking men
who have studied the situation. The
question then arises, what will supersede
Galveston? Some predict that Houston.
fifty miles in the interior, on the Buffalo
Bayou, through the agency of a ship
canal, bullt-at the expense of the Federal
Government, is the coming metropolis of
the gulf. Others say Texas City, three
miles from Galveston, will now be de
veloped and made a grand maritime suc
cessor of the unfortunate island city.
Others say Clinton on Buffalo Bayou, six
miles below Houston, because of its fa
cilities to furnish water and rail termi
nals, will be the Texas seaport of the near
future. Very few expect unfortunate.Gal
veston to rise again and reassert herself
mistress of the gulf. A Galveston man
illustrated the problem very aptly to
night when he said:
"Fully half of the population of Gal
veston will never go back there to live
if they can be got off the Island alive
this time. My opinion Is that Galveston
lias had her rise and fall."

FROM MANY SOURCES
NEW TORK. Sept. 12â New York Is
making noble response to appeals
in behalf of stricken. Galveston,
and by to-night thoiiranda of dol
lars had been raised and thousands
more pledged to aid In carrying out the
work of relief. The business men of Xew
York are alive to needs of the situation
in the ruined Southern city and through
their various trades organizations, as well
as by individual solicitation, are getting
together large sums of money.
Generous continues to be the response to
the Herald's announcement of its willing
ness to receive and forward subscriptions
for the relief of the Texas sufferers. The
fact that the pressing need of the hour is
money is evidently understood and appre
ciated. Not merely from New York City
anti State, but from many other parts of
the country, and even from across the
Atlantic, came checks or telegraphic or
ders, large and small, until when the list
was made up to-night it was found that
the total amount received and sent south
ward by the Herald was $5155 10.
Contributions poured in all day in
amounts of varying sizes, and each sum,
vhether great or small, was sent imme
diately to be applied to the work of re
lief. Almost every contribution was ac
companied by words of sympathy or by
the injunction to let the relief be speedy.
A carload of provisions and clothing for
Galveston left over the New York Cen
tral last night. It was a refrigerator car
attached to the fast freight which left
shortly after S o'clock. The car goes via
Buffalo, where it will be switched to the
Lake Shore and thence will ' go
through East. St. Louis to Galveston.
which point it is thought will be reached
in five days. The car was sent by the Her
ald, which also forwarded three more cars
to-night and will send a special express
train on Saturday.

speak. And he did speak. He concluded
by nominating P. A. Bergerot for tem
porary chairman. Ruef nominated James
A. Wilson. Guilfoyle made the point of
order that there was no rollcall by which
to regulate the vote. Kelly withdrew his
nomination of Bergerot to give Guilfoyle
a chance to have his roll accepted as the
temporary rollcall, and Guilfoyle took the
platform to call the roll from his 1st. The
proceedings had been boisterous through
out, and an uproar followed Guilfoyle's
attempt to force recognition of the Kelly-
Crimmins delegates. Ruef and others
made points of order sustained by Bouvier
that a temporary chairman must be
chosen before other business could be
transacted. Kelly's boosters set up a
chorus of "Rollcall!"
Bouvier would not let the roll be read
and objected to Guilfnyle's presence on
the platform. Kelly and an excited barber
named Calish wanted Guilfoyle to put the
question to a vote on his rollcall, and
Kelly even lost his head and appointed
Guilfoyle chairman of the convention, but
the appointment was not recognized.
"I ask that the police restore order,"
Ruef ehouted. "We cannot do things in
this highhanded way In a Republican con
vention. Let us proceed In a decent and
orderly manner."

Injuries Received by Him in the
Railroad Accident Hot at All
Serious.
Morgue Surgeon Leland made an au
topsy yesterday upon the body of Gee
Fung Gung and was unable to discover
anything but natural causes to produce
death. Gung was driving his laundry
wagon across the electric railway track
on Bryant street on August 31 and col
lided with a car. The wagon was over
turned and Gung was thrown out, receiv
ing bruises which confined him to his bed
in the washhouse until he died. No bones
were broken and there were no evidences
of gangrene. The stomach and contents
were sent to the city chemist for analysis.
It is orobable that Gung's death was
caused by Improper treatment and fright.
GUNG'S DEATH WAS NOT
CAUSED BY ACCIDENT
It "was observed with regTet that tho
Forty-first District delegation accepted
boss orders and voted for Bereerot. The
pernicious activity of Dibble in affairs out-
Klde of the Forty-firet has incensed many
Hc-publicans. There was a conference last
cvf-ning to consider the advisability of
putting In the field an independent Re
publican candidate for the Assembly in
ihe Forty-first. The revolt against Dibble
is so earnest and strong that many lead
ing Republicans are ready to openly pro
claim themselves in favor of the independ
ent movement
In yesterday's proceedings at B'nai
B'rith Hall llepublicans viewed the spec
tacl<Â» of a Democrat in the law depart
ment of the Southern Pacific Company
selecting a chairman of the Republican
nominating convention. Herrin gave the
orders and Kelly executed them. Neither
one cares for the success of the Repub
lican partv or the triumph of its prin
ciples. The railroad company wants men
in the Legislature who wiil do the work
of the corporation regardless of the rights
of the people. Kelly and Crlmmins are
appointed to carry out the schemes of the
corporatloji. Other agents are employed
to do similar work in Democratic con
ventions. When Republican bosses are
hard pressed Kalney goes to their help.
When RainÂ«Â»y lias a dil^cult task ahead of
him in the Democratic camp he can rely
cn the aid of the assistance of Kelly and
Crjnair-ins.
Outsiders Vote Too.
When the doors of B'nal B'rtth Hall
w*re opened, shortly after 2 o'clock, the
<ielo?atcs rapidly crov.ded into the hall
and took their allotted beats. In the case
of contesting delegations, those who ar
rired ttrwx held the chairs by virtue of
squatters' rights. Spectators filled the
cillery ai:d stood in the rear of the hall
and aioug the side aisles. Many of these
crowded in among the delegates and voted
v/lth tne Kelly-Crirr.mins faction, added
Ihclr voices to the zericTrt uproar, and In
various ways contributed to tho disgrace

The rollcall began. The Twenty-eighth
District grave 9 votes for Bergerot. the
Twenty-ninth 11 for "Wilson, the Thir
tieth 11 for Bergerot, the Thirty-first 9 for
Bergerot. the Thirty-second 8 for Berge
rot and 1 for Wilson, the Thirty-third 13

Thirty-eighth 18 for Bergerot, the Thirty
ninth 11 for Bergerot and 4 for Wilson, tho
Fortieth 18 for Wilson and 1 for Bergerot
and the Forty-first 18 for Bergerot.
When the Forty-second District waa
called Adrian Smith attempted to an
nounce the vote, A. H. Becker, a member
of the opposition delegation, not on the
Wilson rollcall, tried to make Smith sit
down and made a motion as If to strike
him. Smith struck back and landed on
Becker's Jaw. A policeman In the front
of the hall made a rush for the belliger
ents and fell down on tho slippery, eaw
dust-covered floor. Another policeman
seized Smith from behind and. they went
down in a heap.
It looked as if a general melee would
follow, and the greatest confusion pre
vailed for some minutes. Quiet was finally
restored and the roll of the Forty-second
District delegates was called. They cast
4 votes for. Wilson. The Forty-third gave
Wilson 10 votes, the Forty-fourth 12 for
Wilson and 1 for Bergerot and the Forty
fifth 8 for Bergerot.
It wns announced that the vote was 103
for Bergerot and 103 for Wilson. Bouvier
declared Bergerot elected, and the tri
umphant Kelly-Crimmlns henchmen
cheered long and loud.
Bouvier appointed Martin Kelly and Abe
Ruef to escort Mr. Bergerot to tho chair.
Ruef balked at first, but finally accepted
the duty with good grace. Kelly enjoyed
the situation and Bergerot didn't seem to
mind it. -
On motion of James A. Wilson Berge
rot's election was made unanimous. The
newly elected temporary chairman made a
speech thanking the convention for the
honor that it had bestowed upon him en
tirely unsolicited on his part. He hoped
that differences in the convention would
be adjusts and that the party would pre
sent a solid front to the enemy.
Thomas K. Kasft nominated Dr. T. H.
Morris for temporary secretary. Frank
French nominated A. B. Mahoncy, whom
he designated as a "secretary by profes
sion."
On motion of A. Ruef both were do
clared elected, and the convention will
have a fierretary in duplicate.
On motions the chairman was authorized
to appoint a committee of fifteen on cre

As was expected, tho Board of Educa
tion yesterday suspended Ebenezer
Knowlton from his position as vice prin
cipal of the Everett Grammar School for
one year without pay. This action Is
simply a confirmation of Knowlton's sus
pension, which was ordered by Chairman

Superintendent "Webster desired to have
his protest duly recorded on the ground
that the board was not aeUng within its
legal rights. Knowlton will now take
the matter to the courts. Tho resolution

KNOWLTON'S SUSPENSION
RATIFIED BY BOARD
The Trouble Begins.
munication Â¦was out of order unless Mr.
Bouvier was willing to hear it. Bouvier
ruled that those present must decide, and
he put the question to a vote and decided
that the ayes had it.
Guilfoyle then proceeded to read the com
munication, in which Chairman Stone and
Secretary Cutter eertifkd that the Kelly-
Crtmmins contesting delegates had been
eeated in the State Convention at Santa
Cruz. Following it he read a communi
cation signed by a number of county eom
mltteemen in which the meeting of Sep
tember 1 In Shicls Hall was recounted and
to which the names of the Kelly-Criin
mins delegates were attached as tho duly
accredited delegates to the convention.
Guilfoyle moved that the names of those
delegates should constitute the temporary
rollcall.
Bouvier declined to entertain any mo
tlons. as only nominations for temporary
chairman were in ordor.
Martin Kelly arose and said that under
the call issued for the primary election
he had bwn chosen as a delegate "by the
unanimous votÂ« of the Republicans" of
his district, and he claimed the right to
and from the floor of the hall suggested
that both rollcalls bo used. Ruef sug
gested that a compromise be effected by
each side appointing a committee of five
to choose a temporary chairman. Guil
foyle agreed. Kelly objected, but finally
consented. A motion was put and carried
that Ruef and Guilfoyle each name five
to compose the committee.
Guilfoyle dutifully conferred with Kelly
p.p to whfim he should appoint. Kelly did
not like the compromise, and finally came
out and said that they could not agree on
the appointment of the committee and
would not name their five members.
Ruef refused to surrender the advan
tage he had gained until after a consulta
tion with Kelly Guilfoyle said that they
were willing that Secretary Wilson's tem
porary rollcall Fhoud be used. With that
understanding the convention proceeded
to the choice of a temporary chairman.
Kelly said hÂ» understood that another
gentleman was ready to nominate Mr.
Berperot, and H. G. W. Dinkfisplel
promptly placed the former School Direc
tor in nomination. Ruef said that his
nomination of James A, Wilson had not
bf*on withdrawn.
Martin Kelly thon showed hts lack of
ventlon accordingly adjourned till Thurs

and Anti-Boss Elements.
PRACTICAL POLITICS.
Incidents of the Convention of Boss
Jack McKamara of the Twenty-ninth
District came Into the convention hall a
few minutes after the door was opened
and found Leon Samuels of the contesting
delegates in the chair which he consid
ered his own. He asked tho Kelly dele
gate to move out, but Samuels refused to
give up the chair. McNamara took Sam
uels by the collar, lifted him clear and sat
him down on tho floor. He then sat com
placently down in the empty chair, and it
is reedlesa to say ho was not disturbed.
Abe Huef did not appreciate the honor
of being, appointed to act with Martin
Kelly in escorting Bergerot to the chair.
At tirst he declined to act. Kelly came
past Huef's seat with Bergerot and the
latter made a personal appeal to Kuer not
to refuse him the courtesy.
"I hope you haven't any personal rea
son for refusing," Berserot, said.
"No, I do not object to you personally,
but I do not like your company," Ituef
â¢â¢But go ahead with Kelly and I will fol
low along behind." And Ruef followed as
far as the edge of the platform, while
Martin Kelly ushered his protege to the
chair with great gusto.
P A. Bergerot was anxious last night
that denial should be given to the report
that he had programmed with the bosses,
lie asserts that he had not spoken with
Martin Kelly and that no attempt had
been made to dictate fcia committee ap
pointments. He states that he accepted
the chairmanship because he likes the
excitement of politics, and that he hopes
to bring about harmeny in the ranks of
the party, and asserts that he will riot
take orders I om any boas. He admits,
however, that the circumstance that he
was nominated by Martin Kelly gtvea
color to the report that he is anxious to
denv It was his understanding that he
was to be nominated by H. G. W. Dinkel-

in the 'Forty-second District, disappeared

was no response. Some one said, "VV hy,

POTHOUSE POLITICIANS PARCELING OUT PATRONAGE - WILL
DECENT REPUBLICANS SUBMIT *?
A report made by Deputy Sheriff Wall,
who made the first investigation of the
case, sugge* s another theory, upon which
the ofllcialsfare working. It is that Ma
hony was murdered or mortally wounded
and then taken to and thrown out by the
roadside, where he was found. At 5:30
Monday morning a dairyman and a com
panion drove over the road and did not
see the body. About 7 o'clock a boy
named Mason, who was passing In a cart,
discovered the body, and getting down
from his rig tried to arouse the man. He
declares that the body was still warm.
The boy went to report to the Constable.
The milkman, returning an hour later,
saw the remains and notice from the Con
stable to keep hands off .111 the Coroner
arrH-ed. The buggy tracks are account
ed for by the boy who drove Up to the
remains, but there are tracks of a cart
that show that some one drove to the
spot out of the road leading to Bethany,
coming around to the open space between
the forks of that and the Llvermore road
and back on to the other road. At the
spot where Mahony was found the tracks
were obliterated by Mahony's body. The
boy did not pass over tnat route.
The belt and collar which were found
over toward the railroad track may have
been purposely placed there to suggest
the theory that the deceased had fallen
from the train. But no one can be found
about Tracy who sheltered Mahony Sun
day night, nor/was he seen about any
questionable place where he would be
likely to meet with assault.
case is that there is a letter at the
Tracy hotel addressed to James Ma
hony, bearing the sending date of |
September 1O. That has added an
other element to the affair. It may
not be for the dead man, but it has
not been called for, and we have rea
son to believe it is for him. It would
be very interesting for us to know
what is in that missive, as his folks
disclaimed all knowledge of where he
was and they seem to be very |
apathetic in the matter of the investi
gation. All information from them
has been very unsatisfactory. We
want to see the letter, and eventually
I believe we shall know its contents.*'
The foregoing are the words of District
Attorney Ashley of Ban Joaquln County,
â¢when "questioned In reference to new de
velopments In the case of J.-H. Mahony,
whose body was found near Tracy Mon
day, and who, apparently, had been mur
dered.
Thus is another strange fact added to
the mystery of the San Franciscan's
death. Mahony's wife and family claimed
they did not know where he had'ffone.
Three Puzzling Questions.
Then:
Who Is the writer of the letter, that ;
was evidently intended for the dead man?
What business -was It that brought Ma- '
hony to Tracy?
Who is the owner of the torn linen col
lar found near the body?
These are things that the officers axe
trying to find out. .
As for Sheriff Sibley, he no longer be
lieves that Mahony was murdered, but
this conclusion on the part of the of- ;
ficial does not In the least clear the mys
tery surrounding the violent death of the
young San Franciscan. While the
Sheriff discountenances the theory of foul
play, he Is at the same time devoting his
personal attention to an Investigation of
the case.
Although the relatives of the dead man
say his departure from San Francisco
Â¦was sudden and unknown to them some
one must have known of his destination,
for there is a letter at Tracy for J. H.
Mahony. Of course the name is a com
mon one and It may be for a namesake, Â¦
but no one Is known of that name In the
railroad town.
The Sheriff has been to San Francisco
on the case, but was unable to find out
anything bearing upon It other than has
already been related In The Call.
"I can find no possible motive for foul
play," says the Sheriff. "Mahony was
not a man given to excess In liquor or
eccentricities. I cannot account for his
presence in Tracy, nor can I learn of any
thing of a business nature liable to have
called him there."
The Sheriff believes Mahony may have
fallen from the train and succeeded in
dragging himself over to the roadside be
fore he succumbed to his injuries. But
In order to do this he must have walked
seventy-five feet and climbed a fence, and
this with a broken neck.

received 105 votes, tr-e number required
for a choice. James A- Wilson, the candi

votes. The contest was conducted amid
tumult and uproarious confusion. Martin

the came Martin Kelly that knifed M. M.
Estee. the Republican candidate for Gov
ernor, ana betrayed Horace I>avla. tht
Republican nominee for Mayor.
The aid and comfort given to Kelly by
the recent State convention at Santa Cruz
enabled him to speak to his henchmen
â¢with some 6how of authority. When W.

Every advantage which he gave to the
boss element at Santa Cruz was brutally

himself, ignoring established rules of pro

GOOD BALIi AT PHILADELPHIA.
The last few days were full of travail
for Tommy Ryan, with his unhealthy
stomach: for the managers of the Na
tioral Club, with a heavy expense hang
Ing over their heads, and for Manager
Sam Pooler, who does finances for Jack
Moffatt. Ryan knew that if he did not
right Moffatt .'ie would forfeit his appear
ance guarantee. To keep thlÂ«* $250 in his
own exchequer Ryan sent to ZIck Abrams,
the stakeholder, on Monday for a consul
tation about the forfeit money. Abrams
visited Ryan and then and there informed
SAX FRANCISCO has been treated
to several prizefight scandals in its
day, but it remained for thJs, the
last and most ornately and ser
pentinely crookedâ the Moffatt-Ryan
fiasco â to force upon the public mind bow
utterly Irresponsible are prizefighter man
agers and athletic clubs, whose sole ex
istence is wrapped up in thy holding of
figlus for lucre.
As forecasted in yesterday's Call,
Tommy Ryan did not light Jack Mnffatt
last night at Mechanics' Pavilion before
the National Club, u corporation consist
ing of two members, J. D. Gibbs and J. J.
Oroom. Moffatt fought A; N'eill. un
iraincd, heavy with fat and a mere time
server. By an accident Neill received the
decision, Moffati dislocating his shoulder
in the third round. .From beginning, to
end tlils Moffatt-Ryan fiasco lias been
covered with a film of chicanery and
cheap jobbery, and the public, gullible
and anxious to be duped, has been made
a ready victim. Patient and cjuiet the pa
trors cf last night's hght waited for the
last turn of the cards. Some expected
that there would be a hand with four aces
in U. but none loosed for one with live.
Two days ago Tommy. Ryan announced
in whimpering tones that the old com
plaint had returned with added forct,
leaving him too weak to battle against
Jack Moffatt. So he notified the man
agers of the N'ational Club that he would
not be in proper physical condition to
appear in the ring on Wednesday, night.
The Ryan-Moffatt bill was a great draw
ing card on its face and no one knew this
more assuredly than Messrs. Gibbs and
Groom. Ryan was seen, cajoled, smeared
with unctuous (lattery and promised many
things, among which was the saving of
his forfeit money, $250. Ryan did what
was expected of him â save out under his
own signature a statement that he wouid
appear primed to tho nozzle with fislic
fire and meet Moffatt according to sched
ule. There is every reason to believe that
the managers of the National Club were
convinced that Ryan .vould not be able
to fulfill his engagement, although they
were anxious to have him do so. Th?
Ryan-Moffatt light meant money in the
club purse.
All Are Anxious.
And then the plot bepan to unravel.
Sure enough, Tommy Ryan appeared at
the ringsideâ to carry out, they say, this
fanciful scheme. lie would enter the
ring 1 , draw his arms akimbo and look like
a determined eladiator, grim and master
ful. His physician would then pronounce
him unfit- for 'fistic battle, and the club
would refuse to let him fiprht. But all
this' did not happen. Instead of a physi
oiun's ban. Ryan handed over to Captain
Wittman last night a certificate of fit
physical condition. Ryan was there at
the ringside, and he said he wanted to
flfrht^not Moffatt. thoiiph. for he did not
come within the 15S pounds as was atrreed
upon in the original articles. This is
where the piot ripens and the counter
plot begins.
Ryan clamored for the fipht which a dav
or two before he wanted not. lie knew
that Moffntt was overweight and the sick
became suddenly well. .,
"I will fight Molfatt at 13?. but no
heavier." shcuted Ryan. "Or put me in
the ring with Neill. Ill go against him "
Ryan sort of liked fat. conditionless Al
Neill and he seemed to know that he
would bo cast aside, no matter which way
the wind blew, but he shouted Just the
same.
Moffatt's Extra Fat.
Moff.it t, upstairs in his dressing room,
lamented his extra four pounds. As an
excuse for the excessive avoirdupois he
claimed that he was informed on Tuesday
that he was to light Neill and no one else,
so he allowed himself to fatten yesterday
morning. An extra two or three pounds
of fat against Neill would only make the
contrast less glaring.
The National Club of course ruled Ryan
off their track and gave Moffatt the pref
erence. Their original plans must, per
force, be followed. So the battle' was
switched to Moffatt and Nelll. After the
him that non-appearance meant a forfeit.
The Syracusan did not enjoy this an
nouncement, yet he Instructed Abrams to
notify the National Club that he would
not fight Wednesday night.
Consternation laid hold of Messrs. Gibba
nnd Groom. Thoy paw Ryan Tuesday
morning and returns. 1 with information
for the purchasers of tickets that Ryan
would be in capital condition and would
.surely tlfrht Moffatt.
The same afternoon the National Club
Â¦tened Al Xeill to be ready to fight either
Moffatt or V.ynn r>n the nipht of the 12th
at Mechanics' Pavilion. Neill was secured
in the sum of $1000 for an appearance and
a battle. Not many hours after Pooler
assured his principal. Jack Moffatt, that
the fight with Ryan was absolutely off,
and that he would have to meet Nelll.
Tliat was the understanding on Tuesday
between the National Athletic Club and
Sam 1'ooler. If not expressed In so many
words, it was tacitly understood by the
parties concerned that the flpht would be
Moffatt-Nelll. and not Mnffatt-Ryan.
Plot Begins to Unravel.

Four.. run niog events were then rattled
off, the favorites getting over the plato
first in two of them.
. For the mile run Morinel ruled a 6 to 5
chance, and coming from behind led out
Jennie Reid and Merry Boy, with some
thing in reserve. Jingle Jinple blew up
after leading for nearly six furlongs.
- Phil Archibald, at odds of t; to 5. tlnally
ouuof the maicif-n two-year-old class, in
& cheap affair framed up for him came
home on the bit. George Dewey downed
Location for the place.
- Hard luck seemed to follow in the wakÂ«
of .Flush of Gold. The filly looked to have
a royal chance to beat her field in the six
furlong dash, being ins-taJled a mild fa
vorite. Powell got her away from the po^t
last, and in a iierce drive lost the verdict
to Lodestar by a nose. Bamboulia again
backed up after cutting a merry clip to
the bc-nd for the wire.
A seven furlongs selling run for maide.ns
fell to Phlegon. the second choice. Treva
than. the favorite, was badly interfered
with on the far turn, getting up in time
to finish a close second.
To-day the directors decided to abolish

heat and his stock went booming, the son
of Mendodno selling a 20 to ti favorite
over the entire field About this time
Janice came along first, when she wa.-i
installed favorite. S. A. Hooper, holding
the reins over game and consistent Dora
Doe, made a bid for every heat, the hon

though getting only third money.

SACRAMKXTO. Sept. 12.-The patience
of the crowd at Agricultural Park this
afternoon was sorely tried, it taking
s-even heats to decide th* winner of the
2:21 clasp trot, and it was 5 o'clock before
the first running race was called. Just a
little more vim and life Infused into thÂ©
game by the officials would be appreciated
by all.
After dilly-dallying for three heats B.
Simpson, tillcrman of the game mare
Janice, a daughter of 'WllMtim Harold,
owned by 11. \V. Meek of Hay wards,
came alonp: and took a heat. The fifth
heat Simpson lost to Richmond Chief by
laying bark in the limber r.-pion too long.

WILD TRALEE IS
RESURRECTED AS
A STAKE WINNER
Tim Cronin's luck has changed. Follow
ing the victory of his sapling Vandal
Tuesday comes the ancient campaigner
Wild Tralee, rounded tack to old-time
form and with speed_ enough to outrun
anything on yesterday's midweek card.
The winner piled up a heavy score in his
six courses and closed his clever exhibi
tion by beating the runner-up, Scottish
Chief, pointless, getting fourteen to his
credit.
The hares forced the dogs to do some
extra Ions? courses, and there were numer
ous "escapes."
Al! through the stake the runs wore won
on mtrit so far as speed was concerned,
as the hares were strong enough to well
test the running qualities of their pur
suers, although the plungers were given
a bad scare in tho run-down in the go be
lw?en St. Helm and Martha Washington. ;

third round in a hard course in which he
displayed all kinds of cleverness beat

Prize Fight Scandal RipensâMof
fatt Dislocates His Arm and
Neill Is Declared Victor.
The first fight of the evening lasted but
three rounds. Bonar Wilt, tall, angular
and with an occasional punch that floored
his opponent, Guy Burroughs, put the fin
ishing touches upon Burroughs' chin with
a stiff right a few seconds after the third
round opened. Burroughs, game and
bleeding, fell flat on his back, dÂ»Â»ad for
more than the necessary ten seconds, and
Bonar Wilt was the unscathed victor.
The second fight, between Dave Barry
and Billy Condon, went the ten rounds
and two extra just to please the referee,
MeDevltt. who made Condon the winner
against all sane and proper judgment.
Barry was picked by the crowd, and when
the decision came hisses, groans and im
precations were hurlPd at McDevitt.
Barry did all the fighting-, Condon'keep
ing as fac away from mixing matters as
his antagonist would permit.
The last act of the farce was played in
the roped ring and ended in a highly sen
sational manner. Impatient and chafing
at the delay, the crowd hissed the an
nouncement of Ryart's refusal to meet
Moffatt because the latter was over
weight. It showed no enthusiasm for
Neill and little respoet for the ancient an
nouncer. No one took any interest in the
fight. For two rounds Moffatt bored into
Neill. who feared collision with the Chi
cagoan's 1 fists. Moffatt was in superb con
dition; NeiH was in the worst possible
shapeâ jur-t such condition as results from
four day*' tstemming of tide and weather.
He was heavy on his feet, slow with his
arms, all no doubt due to the packing of
fatty tlpftuo he rnrrWl over his muscles.
In the third round the unexpected came.
In a elinrh XHU's Fhoulrt-r was under
neath Moffstt's arm and due to 8 sudden
twisting ami wrench the shoulder was dis
located. Mcffatt stood in tho ring help
less, his arm uplifted. Then Neill rushed
at him and forced him between the ropes.
The referee. Jack Welch, realizing llof
fatt's pliKht. pave Nelll the decision and
the injured fighter was taken in hand by
his trainers.. Captain "Witt man and Dr.
McNutt. who were present, entered thf>
rinp and tried to administer rollef to
Moffatt. who was soon after removed to
his drt\sslng-rnom and his shoulder pulled
back Into plac?.
The managerial troubles do not end with
the rlprht. The backer of the National
Club put up $1000 for a guarantee. As the
purse was $2."00 an extra $l."00 was tak^n
out of the receipts. All In excess of this
sum was seized by the backer, who is out
between $KX) and t'300 on his "angelic" ven
ture. The creditors of the club are left
to obtain their money from tho club's
managers.
When the backer learned that Ryan was
not on tho bill he called Oibbs and Groom
tp refund the money to the spectators, but
they refused.
"What becomes of the forfeit money
Ryan posted?" asks the National Club.
Preliminary Fights.
fight, when Sam Pooler's chagrin and un
happlness manifested itself, he gave out
the details of the arrangements with Neill
before the latter would step into the ring.
Nelll was promised $1000 for appearance
and a pommeling. He knew that Moffatt
had licked him twice when he was in con
dition and evidently felt no doubt that
the same thing would happen again.
"More money." said Neill and Manager
Pooler and Managers Gibbs and Groom
were forced to accede. The deal was then
made that of a $2500 purse Al Nelll should
receive $1250.
"But I must not be put out," said Nelll.
"What could I do," said Pooler. "He
had us on the hip. so I promised Nelll
that Moffatt would not put him out."

Is only one form of the suffering result-
lag from a diseased condition of the
tensitive womanly organism. The only
way to cure the headache is to cure the
diseases which cause it.
The use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-

thousands of women of headache, back-
ache, female weakness and other forms
of disease peculiar to women. It estab-
lishes regularity, dries weakening drains,

Cures bearing-down pains.
"I think if it Trwe not for your ' Favorite Pre-

KRUGER FLEES
AND THE WAR
MAY SOON END
President of the Transvaal
Is New at Lourenzo
Marquez.
LONDON. Sept. 12.â The flight of Presi
dent Kruger from what is now designated
as the Vaal River Colony and his arrival
last night at Lourenzo Marquezare regard
ed here 'as indicative of an early end of
the hostilities in South Africa. Another
message from Lourenzo Marquez says the
Transvaal State officials accompanied
President Kruger into Portuguese terri
tory.
Significant also, although It Is uncon
firmed, is the announcement that General
Botha, the Boer commander In chief, is
making overtures to surrender, and the
question whether the burghers will now
follow the usual courso of beaten armies
and lay down their arms, or formally de
clare in favor of guerrilla warfare, must
be speedily settled, it Is. however, be
lieved that President Kruger's action de
prives the Boers of their main pretext for
remaining in the field.
The British war office has issued a long
report from Lord Roberts on the treat
ment of British prisoners of war at Pre
toria, founded on the report of the court
of inauiry. -
Briefly, Lord Roberts declares that the
treatment of the officers was fair, but
that* the food of the men was quite in
adequate and of inferior quality. He de
nonnces the treatment of the Colonial
prisoners as criminals and says the in
human treatment of sick prisoners throws
the greatest discredit on the authorities
then at Pretoria. The prevalence of sick
ness and many deaths of prisoners. Lord
Roberts adds, are attributable to the lack
of proper food, medicines and accommo
dations and the neglect of ordinary san
itary precautions.
LOURENZO- MARQUEZ. Sept. 12.â

officers are staying at the house of Mr.

The order is a simple recital of the pro
cedure of the three district bodies In ap
plying to the national board for authority
to strike and a formal announcement that
the application Is indorsed and the strike
ordered. The order says:
"Do not wait for any further notice to
strike, but cease work in a body on and
after Monday. September 17, 1900."
This afternoon President Mitchell and
Secretary Wilson sat in the headquarters.
Both were nervous. They opened tele
prams from different parts of the anthra
cite region with feverish haste, thinking,
as they said, that each message might be
some concession from the operators that
would prevent the strike.
The three district presidents reported
this afternoon that of the 142.000 men in
the three districts. 134.500 would go on
strike Monday. President Mitchell would
not state what secret influence had been
at work to prevent the strike and which
caused the delay. He said the person
at work had offered his services voluntar
ily and that the matter was confidential.
As to maintaining the men during the
strike, he said: "When men are fighting
for just wages they can subsist on very
little. At any rate, it Is safe to say that
nobody will starve or want for necessary
clothlng. Most of the men live in com
pany houses and we must consider the
probability of eviction, but these, things
have all been fully considered and met
as thev present themselves. At this
time it would be folly for the organization
to go into details as to provision made
for feeding an 1 clothing the strikers."
President Mitchell will leave Saturday
for Hazleton, Pa., to personally conduct
the strike.
Prior to ordering the strike. President
Mitchell sent this message to the mine
owners and managers:
A strike is imminent in the anthracite coal
fields of Pennsylvania. If It comes It will have
an injurious effect, not only upon the coal re
gions, but upon all communities where anthra
cite coal is sold, transported or used. The pub
lic, therefore, is Interested In the result. As
the comnany of which you are president con
trols mines In the anthracite regions, n-e. the
authorized representatives of the anthracite
miners. In order to promote the public welfare
and avert a strike, propose to you and the other
coal operators that the whole question of wages
and conditions In the anthracite coal fields be
submitted to arbitration. An Immediate reply
signifying your acceptance or rejection of this
proposition Is requested.
President Mitchell Says That Plans
Have Been Carefully Laid and
None Will Want for Food
or Clothing.

nished by Moritz Broekman and A. D.
Harden.
McCoy, with liis attorneys, prepared a
statement in answer to the charges of his
wife and Mrs. Corbett.
Mrs. Selby asserts that McCoy has made
$100,000 in his recent fights, Including that
with Corbett. She says that McCoy
brought back $50,0)0 from the Transvaal;
bis battle with Peter Maher netted him
$20,000; the Sharkey light. $^5 000, and the
recent fiasco with Choynski, $10,000. Mrs.
Selby Insists "that her husband has $100,00)
Invested in good securities. McCoy is also
charged by his wife with having taken
her jewels, worth S5C00.
McCoy denies the charge of unfaithful
ness. Referring to the charge that he
purposely lost his fight with Corbett. Mc-
Coy said: "This story Is made out of
whole cloth by two hysterical women
who have landed grievances against their
husbandsâ Mrs. Corbett and my wife.
"I do know Harry Heinds. the Western
sportinpr man who is said by my wife to
have bet larRe sums for me on Corbett.
1 sent him no cipher messages, but Just
before 1 went Into the ring I telegraphed
to Heinds that I expected to win inside of
ten rounds.
"I know Kddie Burke, who is said to
have held forfeits posted by Corbett and
myself. Burke would have nothing to do
with such a deal and I have never had
any business relations with him.
"Burke believed Corbett -would win and
told me that he would bet according to
his Judgment. Corbett surprised me and
won on his merits.
"I wa-s In debt before I met Corbett and
I have now only my saloon in this city.
I have always dealt liberally with my wife
and we have lived well up to my Income,
besides which I have made several unfor
tunate investments.
"I wish I had the fortune that Mrs.
Selby credits me with. If she will show
where I have $100,000 I will gladly give her
half of it.
"I sot $7900 out of my tight with Maher.
There was only $16,000 in the house. In
my fight with Sharkey I got $5000. The
Choynski fight netted me only $26(30.
"I was broke when I commenced train-
Ing for Sharkey. I borrowed $1000 to train.
The same is true of my recent fight with
Corbett. I had $1000 advanced me for use
in training.
"These statements can easily be veri
fied. Instead of winning money in my
bookmaking venture, as Is poprrtarly sup
posed, I lost and lost heavily.
"I am sorry that nil this stuff has been
aired in public. I had every desire to
shield my wife. I wanted her to have
things settled before a referee, but she
has chosen notoriety. Had she not at
tacked by honesty I never would have
made any statement for publication."
MrC^v Intimated that "Honest" John
Kelly had been instrumental in making
trouble for him. Kelly refused to discuss
the case.
MRS. CORBETT SAILS IN
PURSUIT OF HER HUSBAND
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 12.â There is a sen
sational development In the marital
troubles of James J. Corbett and his wife.
She has closed her flat and placed her
furniture In storage, and according to the
report that was freely circulated to-nlslu
In the tenderloin, she has sailed for Eu
rope with the avowpd Intention of finding
her husband. If she Is successful, and
there seems to be little doubt upon this
score, as â¢ she is understood to be well
supplied with money, friends of both ex
pect to hear of Interesting developments.
Mrs. Corbett, it is said, has sailed with
the intention of making It unpleasant for
her husband. Her departure, it was told
by a friend of Corbett's, was decided upon
quickly. She enpaped passage and then
hurriedly had her household effects placed
in a' moving van and carted to a storage
warehouse. At the house to-night The
Call representative was told by the man
at the door that Mrs. Corbett was not at
home and would probably not be for a
long time. He admitted she had gone to
Europe in search of her husband. Hei
maid, he said, did not accompany her.
From another source it was learned that
Mrs. Corbett still loved the pugilist and
that she would never permit him to pay
attentions to another.
"I am lefl to believe by her recent ac
tions and utterances that she will make
trouble if she - gets a chance." said a
mutual friend. It is not known to Mrs.
Corbett's "friends" on what steamer, she
sailed. She hailed a cab that was passing
her house in the forenoon end after hav

LETTERS submitted at the meeting of the State
Board of Trade en Tuesday from H. W. Wiley"
Â¦* of the Department of Agriculture and from W.
H. Mills show that the outcome of the controversy
over a portion of our wine exhibit at Paris has not
been wholly to our disadvantage. By reason of the
controversy more attention has been given to the wine
than would otherwise have been the case, and it is
now assured that the final judgment to be made upon
it by the jury in establishing a rating will be one of
high commendation. . ' .' r ,
Summing up the essential points of the whole con
troversy Mr. Mills says: "The jury of award. Expo
sition Universelle, Paris. 1900, declined to admit some
of the California wines to competition with the wines
of the world because they bore French labels. Sub
sequently the same jury authorized irregular rating
of these wines, which rating was filed with the presi
dent of the jury for such use as he might see fit to
make and for the use of the superior jury when final
action was taken. Publication of these ratings, when
they are obtained, will be of the highest value to the
wine product of California."
. Mr. Wyley's statement of the issue closes by saying:
''A few menjbers of the jury (among them Mr. Phey
rcy of England) having expressed a desire to study
our wines more carefully than was possible in the
ordinary jury work, I arranged for a special trial at
the agricultural space. The gentlemen taking part
represented large commercial interests. They were so
impressed with the excellence of our wines that they
asked me to put them in communication with some of
our principal wine-growers with a view of forming
business connection. 1 am sure that every one inter
ested in the wine industry of the United States will be
clad tojearn that the result of these discussions, bit
ter as it was at times, has been to call a more special
attention to our wines, and to illustrate more strik
ingly their striking qualities. It is gratifying to know
that what at first seemed a serious setback to our in
terests became in the end a means of advancing them.
In fact, it has been demonstrated that our wines are
of such excellent character as to lead to the belief that

THE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN
JLBILEE days r>re over, and now the attention
of all citizens should be given to the issues of
the political campaign. It is therefore gratify
ins that the Republicans have arranged to open the
contest with vim and vigor and at once. On Friday
evening at Mechanics' Pavilion the first grand rally
will be held. The orators of the evening will be Sena
tor Fairbanks of Indiana and the Hon. F. E. Hollo
way â s-tatestnen of the first rank and among the most
eminent speakers of the nation. It will well repay
every voter, no matter to which party he belongs, to
ljtarthe great issues cf the time discussed by such
rulhorities as these. :tnd consequently it is reasonable
to expect that hundreds of independent citizens will
join Republicans in attending the meeting.
With the formal opening of the campaign the work
of preparing for the contest should be carried on ear-
M^t'y all along the lir>e. Every Republican should
register and take sufficient interest in the matter to
see that his friends a^e registered also. Time passes
rapidly and there sho-ild be no longer any delay in
attending to that preliminary duty. The man who
does not register forfeits his right to vote, surrenders
the franchise which should be the proudest privilege
of his citizenship and lenders himself hardly more than
;,r alien in his own country.
After registration each who is active enough to
tnicr upon the wojk Â»>( the campaign should enroll in
the Republican club of his district and take a citizen's
j.-srt in that work. This is no holiday campaign. As
Theodore Roosevelt recently said of the election of
McKinley: *"It was, indeed, of infinite importance
to â¢elect him four years ago. Yet the need is even
jrreatcr now. Every reason that then obtained in his
favor obtains now, nnd many more have been added.
F<;ur years ago the success of Â»he Populistic Di-moc
lacy would have meant fearful misery, fearful disaster
r.t home: it would have meant the shame that is wor^e
even than misery and disaster. To-day it would mean
r.Il this and. in addition, the immeasurable disgrace of
ibandonins the proud position we have taken, of
flinching from the great work we have begun."
That is the issue that confronts us. In the language
?Â»f the street, "it is up to you." Your duty is plain.
Register. Enroll yourself in a Republican club. At
tend the grand rally on Friday evening. Work for the
maintenance of prosperity. Do a good citizen's share
?nd a Republican's share in bringing about the elec
tion of McKinley and Roosevelt and thus sustain
national honor and public welfare.

Robert Weishar of Visalla visited the
Coroner's office yesterday and reported
that his brother William disappeared in
this city on April 1 of this year. The
missing man was 54 years old and 5 feet
5 inches tall.
Precinct Registration light.
The registration in the precincts last
Saturday was very light, only 2500 names
having been added to the roll by the ROC
special deputies. There are about 2-1.000
citizens who have not registered. Pre
cinct registration will be continued on
Saturday. September 15 and 22.
MARK MANNA'S COUNSEL.
SENATOR HANNA, speaking as 'chairman of
. theRepublican National Committee, has once
more warned Republicans of the danger of
overconfidence and emphasized the need of immediate
organization for active earnest campaigning. The
Senator concedes that every prospect of the time
points to a Republican victory, that all the conditions
of the country justify ?. firm assurance of it, and yer
just by reason of those things there is a menace of in
difference verging upon apathy which forebodes ill
to the party.
It ifj to be noted the Democrats have been stirred
to something like jubilation over the Democratic
gains and Republican losses in Vermont and in
i Maine. They have figured out that if similar changes
! occur elsewhere Bryan will carry the country. Such
â¢ calculations. are of course valueless except so far as
1 they stimulate and arouse a party whose members
j have hitherto been too despondent to do much earnest
! campaigning. In the hope of encouraging the doubt
; ful men in their ranks the Bryanitc leaders will of
j course exaggerate the gains of their party in the Sep
tember elections as much as possible. They Will con
| trasrthc returns from Vermont and /rom Maine this
year with those of 1896, when the Republicairmajori
ties were abnormally large, and they will as far as
they can conceal the fact that the Republican majority
in each of those States is this year larger than it was
ever before, with the sole exception of that record
breaking year.
Leaving the Democratic leaders to indulge what
ever joy the3 r may find in counting chickens before
they are hatched, and in calculating a Bryan victory
in November because in Vermont and Maine the
Bryanites were this year snowed under by a maiority
ii little less heavy than was. that of four years ago,
Republicans will begin from this time to. wage the
contest with renewed ardor. Republican leaders are
rot indulging in the claptrap of predicting an easy
and sure victory. They are exhorting the party to
organize, and are rallying<all the friends of prosperity
In his address to the Hamilton Club at Chicago on
Tuesday Senator Hanna said: "Is it any wonder
that men who have lived during the last four -years in
comparison with those four preceding should fed
comfortable? Is it any wonder that we .should have
fjfaith in our institutions, in our country and in our
selves after the years of McKinley's administration?
But I want to suggest that this is no time to enjoy
comfort, but rather to make ourselves ready for the
work which is before us, which is of more importance
than that of four years ago. We can .prove that by
ourselves. Every man's condition can be compared
by himself. His environment and his observation are
object Je'ssofis. and if vÂ»e expect a continuance of these
conditions we tnu?t feel and act that our full duty can
not be transferred upon ,the shoulders of our, neigh
bors."
That is the lesson for Republicans to bear in mind.
No man can safely transfer his duty to the shoulders
of another, nor stay at home in comfort and wait for
another voter to maintain prosperity. Such'negli
gence of the duties of citizenship would result in de
feat and blight even the glowing prospects that now
shine with omens of Republican victory all over the
land. â¢ -

A SORRY SPECTACLE.
POLITICS, like misery, makes strange bedfel
lows, and when the politics is crooked the
strangeness of the bedfello.vship comes near to
surpassing all that misery ever saw. An example
among the worst of its kind was shown yesterday
when P. A. Bcrgerot, a gentleman who stands high
in all the walks of life, honored in his profession and
respected by bis associates, permitted himself to be
nominated for chairman of the Republican convention
by Martin Kelly, and. on his election, accepted the
escort of Kelly to the platform.
Kelly is a man who was awarded by a jury the sum
of one dollar as the full equivalent of the damage
cone to his character and reputation by a charge of
having stolen something he didn't steal. He is a miÂ»n
who for years has kept to the byways and dark alleys
of politics, doing th- dirty work of bosses. Her*-i:i
has been content to laep him in that position. He
his never dared to show himself prominently because
the very suspicion of his support would be regarded a-,
contamination. Even the worst office-seekers who
secretly sought the support of his push liked to be
;ble to indignantly repudiate him in, public and deny
that they had ever spoken to him. He has been, in
fact, a sort of political pariah, scorned even by those
who used him, but new he comes to the front, dis-
I lays hiro>elf at conventions, has the impudence to
nominate men openly, and swells with pride when he
has the gratification cf taking his nominee by the
hard and leading him to the platform.
The author of Kelly's exuberance is the Hon. W.
C. Van Fleet. When that gentleman recognized Kelly
to the extent of appointing Kelly's committee on cre
dentials at the Santa Cruz convention he gave that
creature of the slums a new sense of. self-importance.
Basking and swelling in the beam oT Van Fleet's
recognition, lie has nted it as a sort of introduction
to higher politics. With a sponsor like Van Fleet
the one dollar boss I'sems himself a "gent," and he
picÂ«ume> to play the part.
Poor Bergerot is the first victim of Van Fleet's
protege. It is but fair to Bergerot to say he would
rot recognize Kelly nor affiliate with him in any sort
cf busine**. lie would not think for a moment of
pfking Keily to his club, nor of associating with him
e\en at a dogfight. Still he has had to submit to be
patronized by Van Fleet's pet. He" is Mr. Kelly's
nominee, and doubtless Mr. Kelly tvill for the rest
of the campaign tell his pals what "me and Bergero*
Mr. Bergerot. we trust, is not going to stay long
iu that company. Street-walking is not good, but it
is better than being a bedfellow with Martin Kelly.
We advise Mr. Bergerot to take a second thought
?nd a bath.

FRAUDULENT PRIZE-FIGHTING.
IF the statements made by Mrs. James J. Corbett
and Mrs,. Norman (McCoy) Se"lbi', wives of the
two pugilists who recently gave an exhibition of
their physical prowess to/ a large audience in New
York City, are to be given credence, it must be said
that the Horton law, under which the alleged "con
test" took place, has bOen repealed none too soon, j
These women positively affirm under oath that the
Corbett-McCoy fight was a fraud. Mrs. Corbett, in
deed, goes into particulars and declares that she ac
tually drew the checks with which the sporting men
who participated in the swindle were paid for their
services. Furthermore, she says that after Sharkey
fought her husband she paid Trainer McVey $2000
for his services in jumping into the ring while the
pugilists were apparently pummeling each other. It
will be remembered that in consequence of this ex
ploit of McVey the referee decided the fight in favor
of Sharkey. Mrs. Selby, the wife, of McCoy, cor
roborates Mrs. Corbett in many particulars.
Both women are now suing for divorces, and doubt
less if a contest follows they will appear in court and
submit to cross-examination. Perhaps it is vain to
entertain a hope that the pugs will contest, but if there
is any way to lure them into doing so it should be put
into full force at once by a curious and deserving pub
lic. Certainly the gudgeons of New York are en
titled to know to what extent their legs have been
pulled by these two fakers.
It is difficult to decide the exact weight to be given
to such evidence as that which is here presented. But
it is an old saying that where there is plenty of smoke
there is certain to be some fire, and it is not unsafe to
assume that both the "fights" to which Mrs. Corbett
refers were arranged beforehand for the purpose of
robbing the betting fraternity throughout the country.
It has long been apparent to the most superficial
observer that prize-fighting as carried on b) r the mod
ern pugilist is the rankest kind of a fraud. The fact
that most of the "contests" result in the success of the
pug who has the short end of the betting is perhaps
an unfailing sign of crookedness. The favorite can
not always be defeated, and yet that appears to be the
history of the sport. In other words, in prize
fighting the judgment of the outsiders is always
w rong.
The lovers of pugilism in New York have evidently
had their legs thoroughly pulled since the Horton
law went into effect. The pugs have, according to all
accounts, made upward of a million dollars out of
them. But they need not feel lonesome in their ad
versity. The gudgeons of every city in the country
have wagered large sums upon the "contests" which
have taken place in Gotham and have also been
robbed. What should be done with prize-fighting is.
to forbid betting upon it. If the pugs wen; forced to
batter each . other for the gate money perhaps they
would fight square.

(With copious apologies to the shade of Bobby Burns.)
COLONEL BRYAN and Colonel Roosevelt were
both invited to review the Labor day parade in
Chicago and to address the great audience
made up of the participants in that holiday.
It was an occasion not devoted to politics, and was
sc understood by both guests. But Colonel Bryan is
not a versatile man. He has never been able to open
his mouth and speak on any occasion without talking
politics. Other public men in this country have been
interesting talkers on subjects widely away from poli
tics and partisanship. But Colonel Bryan, whether
talking for gate money to a Chautauqua assembly, to a
State fair at Sacramento, a street fair in Peoria, a
church fair at Lincoln or an affair of any kind, has in
variably improved the occasion by appealing to preju
dices an<l making a. partisan speech. During all these
years it has been the same speech with but few varia
tions. His delivery is good, for he is an actor. Like
an actor, he repeats his lines over and over, year after
year, saying shallow things in a deep way, and
audiences go to hear h!m as they attend the, play, and
they come away with exactly the same feeling, that it
was not real. To them Bryan is playing his part, re
peating his lines, doing his strut when his cue comes,
and that is all.
No one was surprised when he improved Labor day
in Chicago by repeating his acceptance speech, gar
nished by an indorsement of direct legislation by the
initiative. He told the working people that their em
ployers and all others, of what he calls the classes, are
against them, and twanged with his long tongue every
chord of envy, passion, prejudice and ignorance that
may be tense in the hearts of men.
The spirit of his speech was to the effect that la
borers and their families are besieged as in an invested
city, enemies all around them. The law*; of the coun
try are inadequate to shelter them, and they must fight
their way out as a separate, distinct class, with no in
terests in common with their fellow citizens. No
pernicious falsehood, no vicious suggestion, was
omitted. He employed flattery and falsehood in equal
parts. He quoted Lincoln on monarchy again, sup
pressing that part of it which shows that it was a
declaration by Lincoln that the Southern slaveholders
-.% ere the people to whom he referred, and that he was
contrasting free and slave labor and the degradation
of the whole labor of the country by having slavery in
one section. Lincoln was rebuking that slavchold
ing spirit which is yet so rampant in the South that
black labor there is not allowed to protect itself by
the ballot. .Bryan talked at length to workingmen it
Chicago about the value of the ballot to them as the
sole means of getting their rights. Yet he expects
120 votes from the South, where black men are the
laborers and are denied the ballot. If there be anv
I'rcscnt application in Lincoln's warning it is to the
diÂ«-franchiÂ«ement of labor in the South. If denial of
the ballot to labor bo a sign of approaching mon
:'ichy, Bryan will seek in vain for it in the North, in
what he calls "the enemy's country." Here, no thanks
to him or his. the ballot has been secret, secure ami
rrivr.te since before he was born. Here, no class of
citizens are shot at the polls and murdered in the
presence of election officers to punish them for at
tempting to enjoy the franchise. Here no laws pro
tect a false count, as in Kentucky, where a poputar
majority of 40,000 ;vas reversed, under the law which
makes ballot-stealing and false count as snfe as preach
ing or hoeing potatoes.
Let Mr. Bryan go South and quote Lincoln and
tslk about the need of suffrage for the protection of
hbor. Let him go to Charleston, South Carolina, and,
summon around him the victims of Senator Tillman's
disfranchisement amendment and tell them about
government by consent of the governed and the
necessity of the ballot to protect the wages of labor.
Let him carry his missionary effort into that section
that needs it and let the North alone, where all men,
white and black, are equal at the polls and before the
courts, and workman &nd employer have equal pro
tection and equal privilege.
In great contrast was Colonel Roosevelt's speech
to the same audience. It was upon the equality of
right and the community of interest in this free coun
tiy. There was not the faintest trace of partisanship
in it. but it was wholesome, manly and sympathetic.
He advised his audience that the best way to secure
rtppect for their own rights was by themselves re
specting the rights of ethers. He told them that no
one could injure them without injuring himself. In
this free society we ate all embarked together, with
fates interwoven. When one part suffers all suffer.
When one part prospers all prosper. Partiality of
privilege is impossible where all are equal in their
I ower to resent it by the ballot.
His talk was wholesome and manly and stood out
in virile contrast to the vile partisanship of Bryan.
Roosevelt has mixcl with men in the hardest and
hardiest experiences. Bryan has not. He has neither
earned wages nor p"aid them. But he is the stirrer up
of strife between those who do.
BRYAN'S LABOR SPEECH
they would find a better and more extensive world
market should they be offered hereafter under distinct
American names, without any reference to foreign
types." Â¦
The credit for this gratifying conclusion of wna.
threatened to be a serious injury to California is due
mainly to the efforts of Mr. Wyley, and the State
Board of Trade, after reviewing all the facts, has very
properly adopted a resolution of thanks commending
him for his work. It now remains for our wine men
to consider whether it may not be worth while for
them to adopt the suggestion of Mr. Wyley and give
their wines "American names, without reference to
foreign types." .^...

says, that the defendants. In addition to a

the account up, however, to $900. and. It
is alleged, refused to pay the bill and the

William Bartlett, a young married man
living at 2005 Powell street, attempted to
commit suicide yesterday morning by cut
ting his left wrist and throat with a razor
in front of 245 Chestnut street. Miss
Louise Bun,1schu, who lives in the house,
saw him stagger along the street and fall
to the ground. Thinking he was dead she
telephoned to the Morgue, but finding
there was still life left she got a nurse
from the Pacific Hospital, who tried to
stop the flow of blood. The ambulance
was summoned and he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital. Dr. Bunnell found
that he had cut to the bone of his wrist,
severing the tendons and muscles. The
wound in his throat was an extensive
one, but was only superficial. He lost
considerable blood, but his chances of re
covery were good. If- he should recover
he will not have the use of his left hand
again.
Bartlett has a young wife and a girl
baby a year old. Since he was a. boy he
had been employed In the mailing depart
ment of a newspaper, btit lost his job a
year ago through his intemperate habits.
The loss of his position made him de
spondent. He had not been working for
some weeks. His attempt at suicide was
a prreat shock to his wife. They were not
without means, she said, and there was
no reason for his rash act.

"Elaine" from a store window on Kearny
street about twenty years ago, was booked
on charges of vagrancy and having burg

pockets, were booked on charges of
vagrancy.
Three of the pickpockets arrested dur

Wreck of the May Flint Will
Be Blown Up by the
Ship Wachusett Is Overdue at Kahu
lui and May Be a Total Loss.
Suicide.
Attempt to Commit
Just what will be done with the May
Flint is still a matter of conjecture.
Judging from the expense that was en
tailed in the raising of the Earl of Dal
housle and the Blairmore, the May Flint
will never be seen afloat again. There is
only the small sum of $12,000 insurance on
her, so that the only losers will be the
shareholders, and they have practically
decided to abandon vessel and cargo.
Now comes the question as to who is to
remove the "menace to navigation." The
underwriters will take no hand in the
matter, as their risk is small. The own
ers of the vessel do not want either ship
or cargo, and the captain and crew are
willing to allow their effects to remain at
the bottom of the bay. It therefore seems
to be "up to Uncle Sam" to remove the
wreckage. , . ,
The California Ship Company held a
meeting yesterday to discuss the situa
tion. Among those present were W. E.
Mighell, Charles Budrou, William Bab
cock, E. Kentfield and W. J. Gray. These
men are amons the best known Â¦ and
wealthiest of the ship owners of Califor
nia. The captain of " the wrecked ship
was before them and told pÂ»actlcally the
same story as published in The Call. He
was questioned and cross-questioned by
Captain Gray and Mr. Babcock. but failed
to give a â¢ satisfactory explanation. He
admitted that he should have remained in
the lower bay, and said that no instruc
tions had ever been given him to anchor
In the upper bay.
The Overdue Wachusett.
. W. E. Mighell, president of the Califor
nia Ship Company, is a heavy loser on
the loss of the May Flint. He is also
managing owner of the ship Wachusett,
now out 124 days from Newcastle, N. S.
W., for Hawaii, and on which 45 per cent
reinsurance is being offered. Mr. Mighell
and those associated Â¦with him never car
ry a cent of insurance on their vessels, so
the reinsurance on the Wachusett must
be on the cargo and the freight.
In the case of the California Ship Com
pany there has been enough money saved
in insurance on the million-dollar Invest
ment to buy a better ship than the May
Flint, while in the case of the Wachusett
there Is more than enough In the insur
ance fund to make all the owners even
should she prove a total loss. Few peo
ple on the water front, however, think
anything has happened to the vessel.
"Want Remains of Barge Removed.
The- captains and pilots on the narrow
gauge ferry steamers want the remains
of the baree that was burnt Saturday
night removed. They say the planking of
the lower floor is held In position by the
anchors and the whole is in a position to
cause damage after dark should a ferry
boat run down on it.
Too Much Celebration.
J. F. O'Brien tried to make a spectac

HISTORIC STUDIOS IN HOME FURNISHING.
THE CALL'S
HOME STUDY CIRCLE
I Of all the textile fabrics, tapestry, j
ancient of arts, forms the most poetic of .
hangings, the most romantic of back- ,
grounds, the most artistic simulation of j
the painter's .handicraft. The difficulty |
of understanding the technicalities of this \
noblest cf the weaving arts is simplified }
by its classification Into '.'high warp" and ;
'â¢low warp" tapestrieo. As it is manufac- !
tured upon the warp of wool, thread, cot
ton or silk, the weft is worked in with j
short lengths of the desired color and |
shading. The loom is formed of two
cylinders or uprights, around one of
which the warp is rolied and around the :
other the web. The upright9 are placed i
vertically in "high warp" and are parallel j
with the ground in "low warp." That the i
high warp method similar to that used to- j
day by the carpet weavers of the East j
was known to the nations of antiquity is j
proved not only in the pages of Homer, j
where Helen is thus pictured as weaving
tapestry when visited by Venus during
the siege of Troy, but also by the designs
on the old Greek vases, in one of which,
from Chinsi, Penelope Is represented as
weaving beautiful hangings upon a "high
warp" loom. Also in Ovid's "Metamor
phoses" there is a description of the
weaving combat between Pallas and j
Arachne in which the methods employed
correspond exactly to those used by the I
Gobelins in making their largest and most
Important tapestries.
Tapestry weaving takes greater expert
ness and more years of training on the
part of the workman than any other
branch of textile manufacture. So much >
depends upon the weaver's taste and i
judgment in the selection, juxtaposition |
and harmonizing of the shades and tones I
to be used that he must needs have the
instincts of an artist in order to produce
a satisfactory copy of the cartoon or
working model. An unsympathetic work
man, laboring und|?r the disadvantage of i
operating from the%rrong side of his pic
ture, Is not likely to produce the desired
transparency of the usual minute hatch
ing and stippling of colors, and his work,
consequently, presents a harsh or mosaic
like appearance. This effect is especially
to be avoided in the execution of
"storied" tapestry, which is woven direct
ly from a cartoon designed with special
reference to the limitations of the weaver.
Some idea of the bewildering infinite
gradations of color forming the palette of
the loomworker may be gathered from the \
fact that the late director of the dyeing i
departments of the Gobelin factories com
posed a chromatic prism of 14.420 different
tones. The best wool used in the Euro
pean tapestry works has always been im
ported from Kent in England.
It was in the East, the cradle of dec
orative craftsmanship, that the art of
tapestry weaving sprang into JBeing: and j
In spite of the political and artistic fluc
tuations which so strongly influenced the
other arts the Oriental influence upon j
tapestry design remained through many j
centuries persistent in Europe. This was
undoubtedly due to the skill with which
the Old World craftsmen adapted design
to technical necessity and yet achieved
effects instinct with natural life and sub
dued overflowing splendor of color. Tex
tile fabrics reached their highest develop
ment under the Saracens of Egypt, who
taught their arts to the s'ubject Sicilians.
When the Norman King of Sicily took
Corinth and Argos he imported many
weavers from Greece to Sicily, where they
quickly assimilated the Sicilian style. an;l
many of the finest examples of Siculo
Saracenic fabrics belong to this period.
The Crusades also modified the decora
tive arts and caused the Introduction of
heraldic badges and armorial bearings
into the designs of the beautiful Sicilian
textiles.
During the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries Bruges and Antwerp were the
greatest ports in the world, and it was
but natural that Flanders should take the
lead in exporting industries which would
extend her commerce. Consequently the
earliest tapestries woven in Europe were
the Flemish, made toward the end of the
twelfth century at Arras, Oudersarde,
Brussels, Valenciennes and Bruges. This
product of the Flemish looms was ex
ported to all parts of Europe, and in ex
cellence of workmanship and flat treat-

merit of decorative subjects* has never
been surpassed. Arras, because of Its pre
eminence in the manufacture of storied
woavinp, became a synonym in England
for tapestry in general and waa so under
stood by Shakespeare when he made Polo
nlus say:
Behind the arras I'll convey myswlf.
To hear the process.
An Idea of the various uses of Arras
hangings may be gathered from the illus
tration of the medieval chateau. Hero
were hung the favorite local epica. that
those who saw mlsht read of their mas
ter's valor in the hunt, his prowess In the
tournament; or perhaps It was some Bible
story, some fresco in worsted intended "to
point a moral or adorn a tale. " The
weavers understood thoroughly durinsj
the middle ages how to satisfy the sober
est principles of decoration by means of
a correct juxtaposition of tones, sharply
defined expressions of countenance and
such skiilfulness of grouping that the eye
might easily embrace the general effect.
Many of these pieces are still remarkabty
decorative and singularly harmonious in
character, despite the fact that the sub
ject is no longer clearly discernible.
Probably the most beautiful tapestries
In existence are those made at Arras from
the cartoons of Raphael. Rubens found
seven of those cartoons which Leo X had
commissioned Raphael to paint for the
decoration of the Sistlne Chapel cut Into
strips for the convenience of workmen
and rotting in a wooden box in a Brussels
shop. Perforated by the needle of the
copier, stuck to coarse brown paper,
water-stained and faded, there was still
enough left of the scenes from the Acts of
the Apostles to enable the genius of one
artist to recognize the master genius of
another. Rubens therefore induced
Charles I to buy them for Whitehall.
Cromwell afterward purchased them. and.
after many vicissitudes, they are now in
the South Kensington Museum, through
the courtesy of Queen Victoria. The tap
estries from these cartoons were woven in
a tissue of yarn, silk and sold, and
reached Rome a few months before the
death of the artist who had designed
them. After many wanderings these
tapestries are now in the Vatican, but
are less valuable than the cartoons from
which they were worked.
Four splendid cartoons by Raphael's
pupil. Guilio Romano, found their way
into France, whither they had been sold
as rubbish and where they are now great
ly treasured, one of them having been
copied by the Gobelins in the reign of
Louis XIV. It is supposed that some of
the original tapestries from these car
toons were Â» urned for their golden bord
ers.
â¢ When Louis XI of France took the town
cf Arras it was practically the deathblow
to the tapestry-weaving Industry of this
far-famed little place, and Brussels, under
the Burgundian rule, soon became the
center of Flemish weaving. The most ex
tensive collection of Flemish tapestries in
existence is now in Madrid, acquired dur
ing the Spanish occupation of Flanders.
It was Francis I, the French delegate to
the far-famed Field of the Cloth of Gold,
who first conceived the idea of meeting
the immense demands for the enrichment
of his royal palaces by uniting at one
center at Fontainebleau both the fabrica
tion and the designing of tapestry. Henry
IV also protected the Industry, removing
the manufactory from one place to an
other until it finally settled down at the
Gobelins. This place Loui3 XIV bought
thirty years later, uniting there all the
principal industrial centers for dyeing,
embroidery, tapestry, jewelry, ironwork,
cabinet-making and engraving, under the
name of the Royal Upholstery Works.
The Gobelin brothers had. in the reign
of Francis I. introduced into Paris from
Venice the art of dyeing scarlet, an en
terprise then considered so impractical
that it was known as the Gobelin folly,
yet which became, notwithstanding con
temporary scorn, most successful. Their
larger pieces of tapestry to-day command
fabulous prices, because of their world
famous brilliancy, consummate technique
and fine texture, many of the oldest
pieces still being In excellent condition,
despite the mellowing of their tints
through age. Colbert, Minister to Louis
XIV, also ordered of them the manufac
ture of a low- warp tapestry suitable for
furniture, in which they became excep
tionally successful.

Neiv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â Very little can be
cald of Euch a market as that of to-day be
vord the chronicle of the movements of indi
vidual ttocks. I>ealines fell nearer the point |
cf s-tajnatton than even the record of the re- I
cent dullness has yet shown. The few stocks j
that showed any appreciable movement were j
not influcm-ed by anv general condition of '
business, and It was dlftteult in some oases U> |
account for the movement. Telegraphic com- i
mur.lcation was much interruptetl by the storms !
in the West, ar.d this was goffered, as an ex- J
plnr.ation of the extraordinary business, but I
as orders received by teleurauh and executed j
:n trie market have net been a i>erceptible in- I
fluence lor many months past, the explanation i
was not convincing. The most mercurial gpe- j
cialtiep, r.ar.iely People's Gas, Sugar and Brook- j
lyn Transit, maintained their jxxir pre-eminence I
in the market. But the range of their fluctua- j
lions was extended to reach a point only with j
palpabl" effort. Before the market closed
Trices of the three had been dragged back to I
very near last nipht's level. In the railroad
list thtre was s=ome demand for Northern Pa- |
ciflc p.i an extreme advunce of a point, ap
]iarÂ«-ntly t .n the large Increase in earnings re
ported yesterday for tho first week in Septem
ber. This seemed to sustain <nher railroad <
stocks, even St. Paul recovering sharply In j
fp'.te of the heavy decline in Its first week j
of Beptember earnings. The anthracite coal- ;
rrs were heavy, as tho period approaches for the t
declaration of the miners' final decision on j
the Bir:ke. London Iwught Ftooks here again
to-ilay end helpfd the opening rtÂ»e, the London '
market teing encouraged J.y the belief in the j
Boer collarse and seemingly bv the hope that
a renewal of the South African gold supply ,
will soon heio to relieve the London money j
market. Sterling- exchange in New York re- !
acted azaln and yesterday's demand, which J
waÂ« partly due to remittances en account of '
American FUbseriptiona to the British war lean, j
ce-merl patisfieil. Notwithstanding the down- !
I ward course of yterllri? exchange, opinions are j
â¢strangely persistent In some quarters that Bold '
will srxm g-o out to London. Currency geems i
to move rteadily to the South and West and Â¦
I the sub-Treasury is taking small sums from I
I the market with the cessation of transfer of
PaÂ«-irtc Coast cold and the practical diwoontlnu- I
ance oi" <r-erations under the Government re- i
funding law. Local money rates are slightly I
firmer in tone as a consequence. To-day's bon<l

JJury in Judge Hunt's Court Holds
That the Deceased Was Un
duly Influenced.
NOBMANN'S TESTAMENT
IS ADJUDGED ILLEGAL
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 12.â A yearling rplke buck in deadly conflict with an
enormous eagle on the grass-covered slope of Pine Hillâ that was the strange
sight that met th? eyes of Charles Lefevre and a companion while deer
hunting in that locality some days ago.
Mr. I,efevre, In relating the story, said:
"We had hunted all morning without any luck and were returning to
camp along the ridge, when we observed, circling high In the air above the
glades, what we thought was a giant buzzard/ We stopped and watched the
bird's actions. Each circle that it made brought it closer to a patch of wild
oats In the center of the glade. "With a sudden swoop and closed wings the
bird dove Into the deep grass and the next Instant the bird and a spike buck
were in conflict. We crawled to within several hundred yards of the spot and
now saw that the deer's assailant was a large eagle. The deer plunged
down the hill, the eagle perched upon hfs shoulders and wilh beak and tal
ons tearing -at his hide and flesh. Plunging Into a small oak bush the buck
scraped the bird from, his back, but only for an instant. As the deer
emerged .from the tangle of branches the- eagle swooped at him again. The
buck, that had now ceased Its bleating, reared up and with Its razor-like fore
hoofs struck at th<3 winged enemy hovering close above.
"What the result of the battle might have been Is hard to say. We
could stand the sight no longer and opened a brisk lire with our rifles on the
k!ng#of birds. One of the bullets plowed away a hatful of feathers and then
the eagle soared away. We left the buck undisturbed."
Eagles are rarely seen in this county and this one Is probably a stray
vlsltor from the riheep ranges of the north. The eagle Is described as hav
ing an eight-foot rpread to Its wings.

j charged with the murder of George- Stan
| ley at Chiles Valley, in this county, on
I May 29 last, was brought Into the Su
perior Court thla morning for trial.
Much to the surprise of everybody,
George Knight of San Francisco appeared
as attorney for the defendant, and It Is
evident that a hard fight Is to be made
to save the accused from conviction.
Matthai will plead self-defense. The
case was called at 10 o'clock and
the following jury was Impaneled:
E. Manchester, Robert McOreer, A.
Rogers. Frederick Colley, John Mc-
Fearling-, M. Brown, John Simmons, M.
j Montgomery, Joseph Reynolds, Henry
I Weiiver, James Hardin and W. Johnson.
j The case was then continued until Thurs-
I day morning at 9:30 o'clock, when the
prosecution will present Its evidence. Dis
trict Attorney Bell appears for the State.
Tho details of the shooting last May ate
as follows: George Stanley, an old resi
dent of Alameda County, a few years ago
purchased mining Interests In Chiles Val
ley and be^an the work of developing the
property. Matthai's sisters, Â¦who reside in
San Francisco, own land adjoining that
of Stanley. They believe that a mine
located on the Stanley place Is on their
property, so they sent their brother up
to the place to guard it. Stanley on the
morning of May 29 last went with a
nephew of his to the disputed mine, which
Is close to the dividing line of the two
properties, to begin the work of develop
ing the claim. As Stanley drove up the
road leading to the mine he was met by

Defeat the Hardys in the Play at
Doubles at Del Monte. i
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DEL MONTE Sept. 12.â The Whitney
brothers are the coast champlon3 in
doubles for the year 1000. They defeated
the famous Hardy brothers in straight
sets. The Hardy brothers had just re
turned from the East the winners of four
doublo tournaments, only to bo beaten In
their old home.
The play was commenced by Sam Hardy
serving, and the Whltneys won the flrat
four games. The next two fell to the
Hardys and the next two to the Whitney
brothers, giving them the set.
The second set was hotly contested from
start to finish. The Hardy brothers were
not quite in their game and lost the set,
C-3. In the third and last set the Hardys
won the first two games and In the sixth
game had. a lead of 4-2. The Whltneya
won the next two and tied the score, 4
all. The ninth game fell to the Whltnoys j
by clever play, as also the tenth, giving I
them the jÂ«et and match.
The Hardy brothers were handicapped
somewhat by the courts, having- Just re
turned from the Kast. where they played
on grass courts. The defeat of the Hardya
was a great surprise, as all predicted an
easy victory after their success In the
East. The Whltneya are the champions
again in doubles after a lapse of four
years, and the California Club Is in hopes
that they will hold It four yeara more.
Warburton and Fatjo won the Consolation

Detention of Three Minutes by a
Mine Workman Saves Him From
Being 1 Buried Under 300
Tons of Hock.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 12.â It seems from
mail advices which have reached h^re
that the first s;tory sent out about the
death of Daniel Beam and William Ames
at the Queen mine at Hodges was not
quite correct, and further it appears that
three well-known citizens of the State
came within about three minutes of being
sent into the next world with Beam and
Ames. Colonel Isaac Trumbo of Ban
Francisco, the present receiver of the
Golden Cross Mining Company, to which
the Queen mine belongs: Charles W.
Fauly of this city, who was the receiver
before the appointment of Mr. Trumbo,
and Assistant District- Attorney John
Metealf of this city, Â¦who was visiting at
the mine, are the men Â¦who had a narrow
escape.
They knew Beam and Ames and they
also knew that the blast, which had been
prepared, was to be put off in a short
time. The three men had been invited to
pee the blast by the two miners. They
started for the mine, but on the way ono
of the workmen stopped Receiver Trumbo
to talk with him about the mine. The
d<*lay was for three minutes and the
others waited for him. Just as they
started forward they heard the explosion.
Had they not leen stopped they would
have been with the miners when the ex
plosion occurred and would have been,
llko them, buried beneath the. tons of rock
which crushed their lives out. Beam and
Ames were dug out of the debris. When
found they were In an upright position,
but with three hundred tons of loose rock
around and above them.
The remains were placed on a bier in
Brenham place at an early hour yester
day morning, surrounded by roast pig.
duck, chicken, boiled rice and several
sticks of burning punk. During the en
tiro morning tho tom-toms and squeaking
reed Instruments, together with the
chanting of hiifd priests, rent the atmos
phere of the Plaza.
The funeral procession moved off at
high noon, an industrious bunch of Chlni
men throwing paper prayers from hacks
and wagons to keep away the evil one.
COL . TRUMBO'S NARROW
ESCAPE FROM DEATH
When the cortege reached Market street
and Grant avenue the express wagon con
taining the victuals intended for Chee
Cook's spirit on tho long voyage to the
great beyond met with a mishap. The
burning punks with which the wagon waa
adorned set fire to the sacred scrip ussd
for tho pacification of tha evil demons
camping on tho trail of the dead. The
(lames were next communicated to tho
roast pig and other KreitBy matter In the
wagon and then to the wagon Itself.
The unconscious dri\or with his pig
tailed companion who sat beside him hud
no knowledge of Impending peril until the
ilames were communicated to the tarpau
lin covering of the wagun. Then the con
flagration was complete and the attention
of passersby. together with the heat and
the driver's burning curly locks, notified
him of his danger.
As soon as the Chinaman who sat in
front with the driver discovered the con
dition of affairs he jumped from his seat
and. started off afoot as if pursued by a
thousand devils. He Is still running. The
expressman stood by his charge until hi3
hair and eyebrows were singed, when he
also jumped and succeeded In cutting the
traces, clearing the horse from the burn
ing wagon. The timely arrival of firemen
with a line of hose and a drum of chem
ical preparation extinguished the blaz*.
The fire being extinguished the express
man again hitched his nag to the partially
consumed wagon to overtake the funeral
so that he might not lose his day"s hlr-j.
The incident Is considered one of the
v(Â»ry worst omens of HI luck that could
follow a dead man. Hence the prlesta
and punk venders will be kept busy dur
ing the next month, for the evil spirits
who wrought this mischief must be ban-
Ishod out of Chinatown.
AN INCENDIARY DEMON
GETS HIS WORK IN AT THE
FUXKHAL OF THE LATE LA
MENTED MONG CHEE COOK.
NOTHING STABLE
CAN HE DISCERN
IN DEMOCRACY
Principles.
Horace (j. Platt Will Speak
for McKinley and His
There will be a new Richmond in the
field during the next campaign. Horace
Â«j. Platt, who until tho last Presidential
election was a Democrat of the Southern
and extreme type, has decided there is
nothing for'him In the Democratic partv,
and he will be seen and heard on the
platform for McKinl.ey and the principles
of KepubMcanism.
Four years ago Mr. Pratt read over the
platform adopted by the Chicago conven
tion, a_nd he decided he could not stand
for it. He was opposed to the view
taken of tlie money qut-s-iion; to the atti
tude of the platform toward the Supreme
Court; to the demand for a circumscrib
ing of the writ ot Injunction and io the
Kenera! air of wlldn<*jja anil Insincerity
that pervaded the annunciation of prin
ciples. As a consequence he voted for
McKinley and frankly said eo.
Platt believed, however, that the atti
tude of the Democratic party was bsit
temporary and that after it had scon the
error of its ways it would return to the
principles that had been its strength for
years. Instead, howevor, at the conven
tion at Kansas City thi Chicago platform
of It*t5 was reaffirmed iu every particu
lar, and more of the frame kiiul of wild
ness added. It was time to do something.
Mr. Piatt thought, so when he saw Colo
.nel Stone, chairman of the ItepuMIcan
State Central Committee, a few days asp,
be told the chairman that he was at the
tervice of the committee for the next
campaign.
""I do not know how many speeches I
will make." said Mr. Flatt last evening,
"but I will make two or time, anyway.
I told Colonel Stone that I would make
some f-pee'che?, but I do not wish to go
into the country and leave my ofliee.
"1 voted for McKinley four years ago
because I could not stand tho Democratic
platform, but when it was roalnrmed this
yt-ar I believed it ww tny duty to do what
I could to prevent the election of Bryan,
who represents eucb principles as were
annunciated. I told Colonel Stone that I
would be at the service of the committee,
that was all.
"The great issue this year is so-called
Imperialism. I do not believe there is
such a thing; as imperialism cither in the
course pursued by this Government or
suggested by it. I am heartily in favor
of the policy of President McKinley in
the question of foreign relations, and I
v.'ili support him.
"I objected to the 16 to 1 principle of
th*> Chicago platform, to the declarations
rep-ardins: the Supreme Court, to tho re
strictions placed upon the writ of injunc
tion and to the distinctions drawn be
tween capital and labor. I considered the
whole thing a fake and I could not sup
port it. I object also to the paternalism
of the Bryan idea of, government. Jeffer
po!i believed in Individualism, in leaving
the individual to work out his own salva
tion without Government interference.
But the Iiryan idea is more paternal than
any Government of these times, iiryan
ism goes beyond all the paternalism of
any Government.
"I believe In the doctrine annunciated
by Mclvinley and annunciated by others
before him. and I f<rel he is doing with
the Philippines precisely what has been
dope whenever this country has acquired
territory. If we had not expanded in the
wav we did and are doing wt_* would never
have been any more than the thirteen
original States.
"And so far as the principle that povcrn
ment should derive its power from the
consent of the K^verned. it may be an
swered bv the conditions in the South If
the negroes were allowed, to vote there
would not be a I>emocrat from the South
in the halls of Congress. Hut in the South
it Is well known that the preat mass of
people have no say in the matter of rov
trnrr.ent. The negro is not allowed to
vote, and If he should vote his ballot will
be held against him. There is no cry that
the negro of the South must he represent
ed In CongTess. Conditions here are akin
to those surrounding Aprulnaldo. and there
is no serious idea of giving him self-gov
ernment at the present time."
The step taken by Mr. Platt is not a
new one in the field of politics, but his
appearance on the platform is and It will
bring many a condemnation uopn his
head. But Mr. Platt has his own ideas on
politics as well as upon other things, and
I<!s words en the great Questions of tho
day may be the means of swinging some
of tlie doubtful and carrying them all Into
the reaf Republican party.

the enrly rurt of the tvpÂ«Â»k. In sections. The
weather* was favorable for crops, particularly
citrus fruit!Â«. but It was too co.il generally for

Walnuts and beans are being fathered, the
former being generally a good crop. Kaisln

ity than that of last year.
Almonds have been Rathered; the crop waÂ»

The crop is not o.ulte up to the average,
but the quality is superior to that of the
past three years. The homy crop \s much
larger than for several years past and
the quality Is excellent. The hay crop is
below the average, but better than last
year's.
SAN JOSE. Sept. 12.â The weather still
threatens rain, but since the slight shower
last night none has fallen. In the moun
tains south and east of here it has rained
to-day. A large part of the prune crop
has riot yet been gathered, owinp to the
.xrarclty of help, and the continued damp,
cloudy weather has done considerable
damage.
STOCKTON. Sept. 12.-Raln commenced
falling here fat 11 o'clock to-night, but it
Is not heavy and probably will not do
much damage. A heavy rain at this time
would be damaging to grapes ana dry

The big crops In San Joaquln County
this year have been confined to almonds

class doing remarkably well. The fruit
yield has not been up to the average, and
the grain yield has not been what was

greater part of it is In thp warehouses.
The hay yield has been fairly large.

yield of hay was heavy this season and
many ranches had no barn room for the

be damaged in this way. The vineyards
will also suffer to some extent.

CARPENTER TOZIER
KILLED AT HIS WORK
The fall of an insecure scaffolding on a
building In course of construction at the
northwest corner of Sixteenth and Mis
sissippi streets, at 10:30 o'clock yesterday
morning, caused the death of A. E. Tozier
and the serious Injury of W. C. Carey.
Both men were carpenters in the.em
ploy of the Pacific Refining and Roofing
Company. Carey being on a scaffold and
Tozier standing on a ladder underneath.
Because of insecure construction the
scaffold gave way and both men were
thrown to the ground. Tozier was found
on the. car track dead, with a fractured
skull. Carey was badly bruised and his
foot injured. He was conveyed to his
home at 27 Washington avenue.
Tozier was 29 years old and lived at 1252
Howard street. He was a widower and
had four grown-up children, two of them
being in Portland, Or.
Â«=t(=HAT the classes la the public schools
J| axe greatly overcrowded owing to
H the high classification inaugurated
by the Board of Education was
made plain by the report on the subject
by Superintendent Webster, -which was
submitted at yesterday's meeting of the
board. From data gathered by his three
deputies, who have visited the various
arhnois and carefully noted the conditions
therein. Mr. Webster reports that there
are Â£35> classes which have more pupils en
rolled than there are desks to accommo
date. Many classes contain more
than fifty-five pupils, the limit which has
b^n set by the board, showing that its
order has boon disobeyed by the princi
pals. The Superintendent says in his re
port:
There are 1034 pupils reported as
being without necessary desks, a con
dition most deplorable in view of the
fact that in many instances a proper
classification would remove this la
mentable state of affairs. Health cf
children is threatened by crowding
classrooms and theefficiency of school
work seriously impaired. If the rooms
of the school in which an additipnal
class should be formed be all occu
pied, the congestion should be re
lieved by transferring the children
to the neighboring school, or if this
be not possible, by renting a suitable
place in the immediate neighborhood
of the school. Twenty-eight more
teachers are needed in as many more
different schools. Fourteen other
schools are overcrowded, all of which
Â¦would be much benefited by addi
tional classes being formed.
There are 170 classes, each having lew than
tt> pup'-le enrollM. and 459. 'each havlns M or
more enrolled, a? follows:
Number of clashes having DO pupils enrolled,

thould h* asripnea to the Irvtr.p Scott Gram
mar School. The enrollment of the Irving Scott
Grammar School fhows 79 pupils in excess of
the classification fixed by this office.
In primary classes a smaller class
is not objectionable, as the attention
of the younger children is more liable
to wander, and with them the larger
the class the more difficult the task
cf holding their attention. The class
should never be so large that only
a portion can recite each day. If pos
sible, every pupil should be reached
during every recitation. Pedagogues
can be quoted to demonstrate that
classes such as those being operated
In this city and county are not only
an imposition upon teachers, but an

won four thousand dollars.
After congratulating her on her good
luck the boJd swindler told her to put on
her hat and shawl, as he wanted to intro
duce her to the agent of the company, and
that she could get the money. While bhe
was donning her street attire the clever
crook sat down at a table and pretended
to do some figuring. A few minutes later,
when Mrs. Mitchell reappeared, prepared
to accompany him to the office of the al
leged lottery company, he showed her the
figures and Informed the unsuspecting
woman that it would be necessary for her
to "dig up" $28 10 to prepay the express
charges on the amount due her.
Satisfied that the man was as he rep
resented Mrs. Mitchell gave him the money
and with visions of easily acquired wealth
accompanied him to a building on Market
street, where he claimed the local agent
of the company had his office. She was
taken to the upper floor of the building,
where she was told to wait until her es
cort communicated with the "agent."
After waiting a short time Mrs. Mitchell
became convinced that she had been
duped, and with anger In her eyes she
went to police headquarters, where she
told her tale of woe to Captain of Detec

as being about 25 years of age and well

SANTA TERESA USES
HER HEALING POWERS
Fifteen men, women and children af
flicted with some, disease or another per
mitted Santa Teresa, the Mexican girl
healer, to lay hands upon them at Metro
politan Temple last night and all declared
that they .. felt better as a result of the
treatment. The only subject who said he
failed to receive any benefit from the gen
tle touch of the black-eyed senorita was
a man 85 years of age, who has been
blind, deaf and lame thirty-five of them.
Santa Teresa is very mild in her man
ner of ministration to the patients who
present themselves to her to be cured.' It
was too quiet a demonstration, for the
audience which half filled the hall grad
ually thinned out before she had devoted
an hour and a half to her seance. Her

more than thirty pupils. Relative to the
classification which the board has forced
upon the schools Mr. Webster recom
mends that three teachers be engaged for
the Agassiz and Haight Primary schools;
that at least seven desks be placed at the
Bergerot School for pupils now unprovid
ed with them; that at least twenty addi
tional desks be furnished the Bernal
School for pupils now unaccommodated;
that twenty additional desks be placed
in the Broadway School, and that an ad
ditional teacher be assigned thereto; that
an additional teacher be assigned to the
Buena Vista School, as parents are unable
to secure accommodations In the Colum
bia Grammar School, which is overcrowd
ed.
Continuing, Superintendent Webster
says:
Additional desks should be placed in the Ir
ving School and its interests would be well
perved by placing an additional teacher.. Addi
tional accommodations for the Chinese school
could be used. I recommend that such be
r-rovided ami an additional teacher be as
signed.
ThÂ» Clement Grammar School is too crowded
Sixteen additional desks arÂ» required for the
Hrve'.and School, as the classification IÂ« too
crowded. Sixty-eevfn pupils are reported as
not having seating accommodations at the Co
lumbia Grammar School.
In th<? Cooper Primary School the four grades
are very crowded, each containing sixty-three
pupils. There are eistht classes having: over
fifty r-upils. This classification might be ad-
Justed by the transferring of some of the pu
pils to the Hancock Grammar School. Thir
ty-eight pupils are unprovided with desks and
crowded in the Crocker Grammar School. I
recommend that at least one additional teach
er be assigned to this school.
The classes of the EVnman Grammar School
arc crowded. At the Douplass Primary School
pupils applying for admission are refused. I
recommend the formation of an additional
class.
The Dudley Stone Primary School Is crowded.
I recommend the formation cf an additlcnal
class at the Kmerson Primary, where thirty
two children are unprovided with desks; also
the formation of an additional class at Everett
Grammar School, where fifty-one pupils are re
ported as being without desks.
The Fairmount is crowded and In need of at
least twelve desks.' There are two rooms pro
vided with desks of a very flimsy character,
many of which are In such a condition that
they have to be propped up with stirks, and
it is not uncommon, as has been prevloualv re
pcrted to your honorable body, for the children
to find themselves upon the floor, the seat giv
lr.p'away without any warning.
I recommend the appointment of one ad
ditional tescher at the Franklin Grammar
School. At the Fremont School twenty-nine pu
pils are reported to be without desks. One ad
ditional teacher could be well employed here.
At the Garfleld School forty-six pupils are
reported as heing without desks. I strongly
recommend the appointment of another teacher
at this school.
I have ppoken of the Haijrht In connection
with the A cays i7. School. Two rooms In that
buildins are unoccupied notwithstanding the
In operation in that school are reported as '
being unprovided with desks. Three additional ;
teachers could well be employed In the Halght I
end Arasslz schools.
Hamilton Grammar School la In a most
crowded condition, nineteen pupils being re
ported as beinjr unprovided with seats. I recom
rr.t-nd the establishment of a new class In this
school.
Classes In the Hawthorne are crowded, and
the Hearst Is crowded In some classes and
the grade:- appear to be excessively divided. !
The Horace Mann Grammar. Lincoln Gram
mar end the Xoe Valley schools are very ;
crowded and additional teachers could be well â¢
employed. !
Additional desks should be given the pupils
of the Humboldt School, whose classes are
crowded. The classy are altogether too larjre
in the Irving: Prlmaiy- It should be borne in
mind that half of the ofcililren in this school,
as well a* in the Lafayette and the Garfl>l<i,
are unable to Fpeak the English language,
therefore the establishment of small classes In
these schools Is most imperative.
I recommend another class for the accommo
dation of the children attending the Irving
Srhool. In a cla^s of the Jefferson School, the
number of children enrolled is renorted to be
thirty-six in excess of the desks provided for
their accommodation. An additional class
might well be formed in this school.
An additional class should bÂ« formed at the
John Swett Grammar School where the en
roiled pupils are forty-seven in excess of the
number of deyks.
I recommend that additional accommodation
be Riven the Lafayette School and a new class
formed.
Much more effective work would be accom
plished in the Longfellow with one more teach
er assigned to the school. The enrollment of
the Marshall Primary Is fifty-eight In excess
of the number of desks, therefore pupils ap
plying for admission cannot be accommodated.
One additional class Fhould be formed for the
accommodation of the school. The Mission
Grammar School is in a crowded condition and
the services of an additional teacher could be
well employed.
The enrollment of the Moulder Primary is
reported to be forty In excess of the number of
defkn. An additional class should be formed
in this irchool.
Pacific Heights School should have at least
one additional teacher in view of the fact that
pupils applying for admission are refused. I
recommend that an additional teacher be em
ployed In the Park Primary School.
Th<? Peahody Primary fichool le crowded and
an additional class could be- formed to the bene
fit of the fichool. In the Sherman the smallest
class numbers fifty-three. Additional accom
modations should be prot'tded for this school.
I- recommend the formation of an additional
rlaFE at Srrlnr Valley Grammar School: also
an additional class at the Starr -King School, ;
in whose classes there are thirty-one enrolled ,
pupils unprovided with seats. Additional desks
bhculd be provided for the pupils at the Sunny
eide School and an additional teacher assigned
Â¦ to the Sutro Primary School.
At the John W. Taylor School new pupils'
desks are needed. The classes in the Washing
ton Grammar and Whittler Primary Schools
are very crowded. It would be well to asslgrn
an additional teacher to the Whittler Primary
School.
At the conclusion of the reading of ths
report Chairman Mark stated that the
only difference between the classification
of Webster and that of the board was
that the former figured on the enrollment
and the latter based Its figures on the
average number belonging: to a class. To
this Webster replied that accommoda
tions must be provided for children who
are enrolled whetlier thfy attended school
everyday or not. "Webster called the
board's attention to on? class which has
Fixty-seven pupils and ten that have sixty
pupils.
*1 admit that bohip of the classes are
overcrowded." paid Mark.
"I know that the best work Is done
where the classes are most crowded." In

<fi\ JTÂ» rs. GRACE MARIE DICKMAN
/WVy and Charles K. Dickman are dl-
II JA \ vorced. On the 21st of August
% the case was tried . by Judge
Bahrs behind closed doors. Dickman was
charged by his wife with infidelity. How
ever, he' failed to appear,' and the case
went by default. Sinoe the decree was
granted the matter of divorce has been
kept extremely quiet. The case was with
held from the records, and if it had not
been for chattering intimate friends if is
probable that for some time to come the
world would have been Ignorant of the
fact that the Bohemian Club man and his
talented wife had been legally separated.
Both of the Dickmans are well known
both in social and artistic circles. About
seven years ago Mrs. Dickman was the
reigning musical favorite here and took
leading parts in all the society amateur
operatic performances that were then so
popular. Shortly after husband and wife
left for Europe, he to study art and she
to study music, and this artistic pro
gramme both Mr. and Mrs. Dlckman car
ried out to the full. A few months ago
the Dickmans returned after their long
sojourn in Paris, and almost the first
thing their friends heard of them was the
fact that Mrs. Dickman was seeking for
a divorce from the husband she had been
married to for twelve years.
Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Dickman will re
turn to Europe. Mrs. Dickman is pre
paring to teach singing in the latest ap
proved methods as represented by Jull
anni and Bouhy, her masters. Mrs. Dick
man has opened a studio in the old Press
Club rooms on California street.

BILLS APPROVED
BY REGENTS AND
ORDERED PAID
Bills against the University of Calfornia
amounting to $30,146 05 were approved and
ordered paid by the Board of Regents at
their meeting yesterday afternoon in the
rooms of the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art.
The reading by the secretary of the long
list of bills brought on a mild tiff between
Judge Wallace and General Barnes, which
ended in a victory for the military re
gent. The general seldom has an oppor
tunity to attend the sessions of the board,
but when he does he enters into the work
with all the ardor of a .man just elected
to office. ' Judge Wallace makes the proud
boast that he has attended the meetings
of the regents for the past twenty-five
years, and when an attempt is made to
Introduce innovations which tend to do
away with the dyed-in-the-wool practice
of the board he strongly opposes the
change. An illustration of Judge Wal
lace's dislike for changes in the regular
order of business of the board was given
at yesterday's meeting. Each regent held
in his hand a typewritten list of bills and
as the secretary called out the name and
the amount due the members would check
it on their list.
General Barnes saw the futility of such
a course and threw down his paper in dis
gust. He sarcastically suggested that the
vouchers also be read. He whispered to
Arthur Rodgers and to President Wheeler
and the latter agreed with him that the
course being pursued was not only useless
but a waste of valuable time. The gen
eral expressed himself in the matter, but
as Senator White, who was in the chair,
said he could not change the order of
things unless a motion was made the gen
eral pointed out the uselessness of read
ing the amounts by calling on the secre
tary to read the items of each bill. This
course was pursued for a few minutes,
when Regent Hellman, who saw that the
reading would consume several hours,
mildly protested. He stated that the bills
were first signed by the president and
secretary of the university and then
audited by the finance committee. He was
opposed to the long agony. Then Regent
Poster explained that the course being
pursued was unnecessary and was not
countenanced in business circles. Judge
Wallace tried to show the value of having
the clerk read the long list and spoke
about precedents set by the board. He
said it was a proud boast of the board
that 10 rents had not been lost in twenty
five years and that when he went before
the Legislature he wanted to be in aposi
tion to stale that fact. Genera! Barnes
in replying to the Judge cited the case of
a certain Senator from California who
thought it was' his duty to read every bill
introduced in the upper House. As there
were 14,000 bills introduced since January
he was still engaged in reading them. The
general also twitted the Judge about the
10 cents that was never misspent, and he
said the world would never hear of it.
He therefore made a motion that the
reading of the bills be dispensed with.
Eleven members voted in the affirmative
and Judge Wallace in the negative. Hav
ing succeeded in his play for new meth
ods. General Barnes moved that the ac
counts presented by the finance committee
be approved and paid, and his motion pre
vailed. Thus the entire matter was set
tled and the regents were able to go into
executive session and discuss matters of
moment to the university.
President Wheeler moved that thc
maintenance of the summer school be
kept up for the next summer and that the
Regents guarantee the payment of sal
aries up to $4500. The motion was carried.
President Wheeler expressed the belief
that there would be irom seven hundred
to one thousand students in attendance
the coming summer.
The assets of the University of Califor
nia as read by the secretary are: Princi
pal, $1,959,114 04; Lick Fund, S90.01S; D. O.
Mills Endowment, $100,000; Michael Reese
