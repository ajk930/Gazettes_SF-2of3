Each sheet was thinner than tin. and tho
Hidden away on Cumorah Hill. In West
ern Xew York, were tho records, which
to the Saints form the true connecting
link between the New World, and the Old.
They are said to have been written by
the Prophet Mormon, only . some claim
that his name was not Mormon at all, but
Moroni, and that the term Mormon U but
a nickname given to the Saints by their
enemies. At all events, the prophet waa
the last of a prehistoric race that lived
In America both before and after the time
of Christ; and the book of Mormon even
tells of a visit of Christ to America after
the crucifixion.
Alone In tbe woods he thought and
prayed. One day an anpel came to him
and told hinv if he would live uprightly
his course would be made clear. This he
tried to do and was finally rev/arded by
the return of. the angel, who told him
where to find the plates.
The Saints have always been perse
cuted. There are many stories of their
struggles. Alexander Smith tells how his
father, when about 11 years of age, at
tended a camp-meeting in New York and
had a spiritual awakening. The meeting
was one of al! denominations and when
It ended the different churches squabbled
over the division of converts. This set
the boy to thinking, but he could not
decide which church was right. He was
advised to read his Eible, and turning to
a passage In James he read: "He that
lncketh understanding, let him ask of
God. who giveth liberally and upbraldeUi
not."
Alexander Smith looks well fed. and his
pepper-and-salt suit Is far from thread
bare. Knowing that all his time Is de
voted to church work and that the leaders
of the Saints receive no salary, one nat
urally wonders wherewithal shall proph
ets and patriarchs be clothed and fed.
It is by voluntary contribution. When
ever a Saint f>cls he can afford it he slips
a quarter, half-dollar, a dollar or more)
Into the hand of the leader. It Is said that
the Saints have a sort of personal pride
In eeeing that their priests and bishops
and prophets and patriarchs are well
cared for. Each- donation the patriarch
puts down in a book and at the next
fathering he reads the amounts that have
been given. Perhaps if Saints are no more
than human this performance stimulates
their liberality. The ordinary citizen likes
to see his name at the head of a sub
scription list or to read In the paper that
he bid highest for a box at the charity
circus, or contributed most to the famln*
fund. /
It was about this time that Joseph
Smith the younger was operated upon by
an Influence that revealed to him that ho
was to be the leader of the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.
After the murder of Jo<Â»er>h Smith, the
first prophet. In 18 H. his 200.000 followers
had scattered to the ends of the earth.
except the handfulâ some 2^.000 or S.OOOâ
which followed Brlgham Young to Utah.
In 1S60 the scattered member* began to
be acted upon by the same Influence that
touched Joseph Smith the younger.
"You see." said Smith, the patriarch.
"we believe In the operation of tho Holy
Ghost, that by Its Influence we are In
formed and directed: and those men who
held the priesthood under my father were
commanded to come together. The Chris
tian church as organized by Christ had
been lost and could not be found among
any of the so-called Christian churches.
It was necessary that there should be a
restoration, and this took place at Am
boy. 111., where my brother became the
leader of t e reorganized church."
The system of the Saints Is based on
that of the primitive church. There is a
confusing number of leaders, at thÂ» head
of which Is the president, now Joseph
Smith, and two counselors, one of which
Is Alexander Smith, who has but recently
been raised to the degrree of patriarch.
Below thi3 presidency of three are the
twelve apostles, the seventies, high
priests, patriarchs, elders, bishops, teach
ers and deacons. Of each of these a cer
tain number constitutes a quorum, and
there are a given number of quorums.
Nexf In Importance to the apostles are
the seventies, or seventy elders, who con
stitute tbe traveling ministry and are sub
ject to be called on missions. When the
church Is fully organized there will ba
seven quorums of seventy, but this, they
say, will not take place until Christ comes
to earth again. There are row but two
quorums. . hence the present activity
among the Saints, for In a measure the
millennium depends upon their zeal.
"In a vision," said Alexander Smith,
"the lives of these four men passed before
me and I saw them meet the fate of that
other lying eenseler* and bleeding In the
glare of the light. It was enough for me.
But It was three or four years before I
entered the church."
It may. seem strange to the unbeliever
that a "prophet, seer and revelator**
whosp relation to the church Is that of
mouthpiece of the Supreme Being, should
have Bpent a good share of his life trav
eling unholy paths. But Alexander Smith
says that after his father's death thÂ»
mother married autside of the church,
and both he and his brother were any
thing but godly men. They were of t he
arth earthy. They loved the dance, the
card table, the bottle. Perhaps they werÂ«
no worse than other young men; certain
ly they were no better.
It was in a saloon that Alezandsr
Smith's first revelation came. One night
four young men sÂ»at at cards, each Intent
on the game. An old man wan brought
Into the room, dead drunk and hurt by a
fall In the gutter. The younc men played

dors than one son tt mast-to* rcrÂ«a!Â«4
which son shall succeed him. There wÂ«rÂ«
four of us boys. One Is dead, and thÂ«
fourth one was In the church until WÂ»
mind failed."
Mr. Smith admits that be mlÂ«fct possibly
be the next prophet, but It would hav* to
be revealed to h!s brother Joseph, and
not to hfm.
The patriarch of the church may .bÂ« a
"prophet, seer and revelator." but his
prophecies, seelngs and revelation* are
for his own personal guidance, ar.d tha
church will have none of them. The
church grants that he may have thÂ»Â»pow
er. but It refuses to recognize any reve
lations but those of the official prophet.
Alexander Smith says he has had many
revelations. Indeed, revelations from God
soem as common to htm as bits of josslp
gathered from his neighbors. It waa a
revelation that caused his conversion.

Ail physical apparatus, though, has It3
errors, for nothing is perfect but the mas
ter mind which seeks to work out its the
ories with lifeless metal and glass.
To illustrate the inconceivable, fineness
of the delicate discrimination of the zen
ith instrument. It is. of course, known
that all plummets wherever freely sus
pended point directly toward the center
of the earth. It follows that as they are
convergent lines there, must be a differ
ence in the direction of two plummets
hanging only ten feet apart. The zenitn
telescope Is fine enough in Its work to
measure that infinitely small angle, which,
email cs it is, is still there,* capable not
only of measurement uut of mathematical
expression, which is one-tenth of a sec
ond of arc.
All four of the international observa
tories are fitted with the same appliances,
the principal part of which is what is
known as tho "zenith telescope."
While these- instruments are small, * be
ing of only four-inch aperture, they are
unrivaled in their perfection as Instru
ments of precise measurement.
So great is the interest taken in the in
vestigations that she Russian Govern
ment has at its own separate expense es
tablished a station almost directly oppo
site acioss the world from Uklah, on the
same parallel, and located on the Identical
spot where once was the. Garden of Eden.
The stations were finally located within
a few seconds of the same parallel of lat
itude, that of north 39' 08' 10". One of them
is in Japan, one on a small island near
Sardinia, one in Maryland and the fourth
in Uklah, Cal. . -
Added to these details -was the prime
necessity that all of tne stations should
be in localities where there were nights
for good seeing, well interspersed through
the year, as long continued foggy inter
vals at any one station would/ render the
observations of all useless.
In selecting the sites the whole surface
of the earth was looked over, and In the
final trying out it was found that there
was no place on the whole continent of
Asia which would meet the requirement*
of the observatories.
In addition to these requirements It
was necessary that each station should
be similarly located in regard to moun
tains, plains and water, which regulate
fitmospheiic conditions and the surround
ings which produce them, so that the
aberration caused by atmospheric refrac
tion should be the same in each case.
one parallel which were surrounded bj
civilization and located one in each quad
rant of the globe.
So great is the care taken In all ot the
work that even this stone is sheltered by
a tin casing and that again with a slat
ted house, shown in the distance in the
picture, Ie3t the elements should warp
it and change its position.
The necessity for fixing^ the exact posi
tion of the pole Is greater at the present
time than | ever before, for the speed of
ocean steamers, their number and the im
portance of their freight make it neces
sary, that the .paths of the sea be no less
well defined than those above the shores.
The stars are the milestones of the sea,
and when the mariners waÂ»t to know
where they are they can read the an
swers in the stars, but the answers are
given In degrees of latitude and longitude.
Now, if the meridians and parallels are
marked on the wrong places on the maps
the answer will be wrongly interpreted
and the ship will be just that much
astray. Nearly every question of as
tronomy and navigation hinges sooner or
later on the position of the observer
. There, for Instance, is the problem of
the ellipticity of the earth's surface
which enters Into every computation of
the earth areas or directions. Is the earth
flattened at the poles or not? Until the
question Is settled of 'the exact figure of
the earth no boundary line can be 'run
with exact precision and shoals and dan
gerous rocks cannot be platted with abso
lute accuracy. For now in all measure
ments, whether upon land or sea. In sur
veying as well as platting, there Is al
ways an error to be reckoned with \
mistake in making the proper correctlo'n
upon the sea sometimes runs the ship
upon reefs or shoals. We are not sure of
our measuring rod. as it Tvere. Imagine
a yard stick with thlrty-nve Inches mark
ed out,' but it Is uncertain whether the
space from the thirty-nfth Inch to the end
of the yard stick is really an Inch. If it
be either a little longer or shorter than
; an inch then all measurements made with
- tho stick will contain a slight error and
the stick can only measure correctly
when this error is rectified.
Counting the equator as one end of this
yard stick, the other and unknown end is
at the pole. We know there Is an error,
but" this error cannot be rectified until
that unknown inch or any fraction there
of has been accurately measured.
Â¦ It can Feadily be seen that the contour
of the -earth, at the pole must be reck
oned with. But the znost decisive data
concerning the ellipticity of the earth can
â¢.only be! obtained through ' pendulum an>l
astronomical observations. When the
question is settled the tables In nautical
As to physical characteristics at tha

where much the same, there Is no reason
to suppose that some marked and ex-.
traordlnary characteristic i3 indicated at
the north pole. There will be either land
or water at the pole, such a.i character

How. then, would an explorer know the
pole should he have the good fortune to
reach It? Well, the phenomena of the sun
during th<r;polar day or of the heavenly
bodies â¢ during the polar nlgl-.t would be
one Indication. But if the pole is reached -
It will in all probability be during the six
months of light. The explorer takes fre
quent observations of the sun all along
his northward march to determine his
latitude and longitude. By computation
he should know when he has reached the
earth's apex, for then the observations .
should show 30 degrees latitude or none,
and 3C0 degrees of longitude or none at all.
Until the location of the pole Is fixed

that she collapsed entirely. She dropped

This the Josephltcs then refuted and

the City Council of Xauvoo passed an act

BERTHA H. SMITH.
A curious case was tried before tha dvfl
courts In Vienna, the other day regarding
a claim arising out of a railway accident.
The plaintiff stated that he had received
Internal injuries as the result of the ac
cident.- The medical experts maintained
that the shock of the smash had caused
the hea^t of the plaintiff to change from
its normal position to one lower down in
his body. This theory waa received with
incredulity by the Jurymen, but their
skepticism was satisfied when they ap
plied their hands to the man's ribs and
could feel the organ beating in the usual
manner. The medical men stated that tha
sufferer might live for several years,
notwithstanding the extraordinary dis
placement of his heart, but that he was
more liable to heart failure and would ex
perience great difficulty In doing his
work. Under these circumstances tha
jury awarded the" plaintiff heavy com
pensation.

"Besides the goo^ that dancing does, it
is pure pleasure," says Miss Vincent. "In

"It is absurd. I pay. to think for a min

Vincent. "You can Just as well learn
the loosi-Jotatefl motions of the Southern

The latter are far more artificial than the
former."

Querita Vincent Tells the Secret of Buck and Wing Dancing
Querlta threw her arms about her Joy
fully. "That's it!" she cried. "That's thw
way. Let yourself go and you can learn
the buck and wing!"
â¢And with courage renewed they set to
work again and In three lessons the pupil
was well on the way toward rivaling her
teacher. "She had enough natural grace
and her full allowance of Joints, but she
had trained her body in the ways of swell
dom, and she had to get back to first
principles before she could dance. She
was a success finally and the dancing
practice grave her grace in all ways. There
Is no such all-round physical training as
dancing."
Miss Vincent learned her buck and wing
steps at first hand. While she was In
New Orleans a few years ago she began
watching the pickaninnies on the levees.
She watched them at first because they
were blessed black babies and they
amused her. Later she discovered that
they knew something about dancing that
they might teach her.
When this dawned upon her she began
to spend her pennies in getting them to
dance more. From 9 to 12 every day she
stayed on the levees, the pupil of the
bucks and pickaninnies. She absorbed
while she was there. Then she went back
to the hotel and tried the steps over and
over until she had them perfectly.
After she had learned .the steps of the-
Southern dances her next task was to
make them all over. She took a tuck In
them here, she let out a seam In them
there, and by the time she was through
you would never have known them for
the steps they started* to be.
In the first place, no two darkles dance
alike. They make their own steps to suit
themselves. So there are no Ironclad
rules for buck and wing dancing, and
Querlta takes the most impudent liberties
with even such as there be. But she
never gets away from the spirit of the
thing. The keynote of buck and wing
/lancing is to fall to pieces, and this
Querlta follows faithfully.
There is a history attached to these
loose- Jointed motions. In old days It was
customary for the negroes to dance
against time. Long before they were
weary they would pretend to be and then
set In a tumbling step with the purpose
of making spectators believe that their
finish was near. Â¦?Then came a sudden
rally that proved the tumbling all a
hoax. Little by little, though. It becams
incorporated In the dance, until It was
the principal part of It.
"Cakewalklng Is built on a good deal
the same plan," says Miss Vincent; "but
a true cakewalk Is almost a play when It
is done by those who understand its sig
nificance. From the old French country
dances it sprangâ those that were known
In the New Orleans regionâ and It de
veloped under the encouragement of tha
plantation masters.
"The cakewalk of slave days was a woo*
Ing. In it the man's choice of a partner
meant more than for the dance. It signi
fied his proposal of marriage.
" 'Will yo' accep' ma nan' foh de cake
walk. Miss Jemima Mehltabel?' he would
say. And Jemima Mehitabel's reply
meant yes or no for life.
"But you can't guess what dancing
means to the health." rambled on Quer
lta. "I'd like to pet Into a good argument
with anybody and show that dancing can
win out against all kinds of exercise. I'd
like to prove that It's away ahead of swim
ming. It keeps the hair much dryer, for
one thins; but that Isn't the, only reason.
It's far and away better than fencing,
because It Isn't so one-sided. Golf Is
eclipsed beside It. for golf Is a lazy game.
"Above all things, dancing gives grace.
A good dancer Is always a good walker.
If you dance much and well, that Is la
a free way. not In stiff glides, every mo
tion you make will be graceful."
Watch Querita. and see If yon don't
think her theory la worth something. ShÂ«
Is as Ions as the moral law. you know.

In "The Lunatic at Large" J. Storer
Clouston draws a curious characterâ a
combination of brilliancy and Irresponsi

llcloualy funny, and at all times the luna
tic keeps the reader on the alert in follow
ing his escapades. The way In which he
treats poor little Lady Alice, a child of
sentiment, who befriends him. Is inexcus
able, even in a lunatic: but she finally dis
covers in the Baron a more appreciative
person, who easily falls a victim to her
pretty face.
The Baron is the most admirable char

lunatic meets just after he has escaped
from the asylum, and together they go

ridiculous situations are enacted. . Â¦

"The Optimist affords a free parliament
for the expression of opinion. A few

he diverts himself and here and there
chances to find u. reader, well and good.
If not. It concerns no one. except himself.
Forty or fifty pages will be set apart in
each Issue for the expression of others,
and the only restriction is that they pass
muster on the score of originality of ideas
and vigor orfflicity of expression."
That gives an indorsement that tho

A.Drean) of a Tbrone
This powerful 'romance, by Mr. Em
breo.deals with a Mexican uprising half a
century ago. It is a very dramatic story,
telling of thrilling adventures of charac
ters full of life.
The writer shows a perfect knowledge
of both the scenes of his story and Mexi
can life.
Vicente, the leader of the revolt, is the
son of tiie last daughter of the ancient
royal house which corresponds to the
house of ilcntczuma in the Azetc capital.
An American. Iiodrigo. is opposed to him.
The following account of the death of
Vicente will give an Idea of the strength
of the story:
"They led him straight up the steep and
rupged hill, the crowd remaining at ltd
bottom. The example -would be held high,
in sight of all the world, that revolutions
might be no more. The climb was difficult
ar.d wearying. But he never halted or
seemed fatigued. It was rather that he
led them than that they led him. He was
among the first, even the first. He went
up steadily, strongly, his eyes raised.
Cactus and bowlder and shrub he saw not.
He seemed to run to meet death, so that
the soldiers scarcely could follow. They
emerged at last on the summit. He was
already there. lie stood on the highest
rock and swept that incomparable scene
with ' his eyesâ Chapala under him. its
red-tiled roofs lit by the setting sun; the
cape and the lake's vast sweep beyond;

TiiÂ« story hiryjea upon events which

that Madame Van Vrankin was at one

honored by the offer of his hand, which

ar* devoted to all sorts of secret societies

other purposes, and every uprising or
disturbance !n modern China has been

the author, Howard C. Hlllegas, who
wrote "Oom Paul's People." says that thÂ«
Boers never hail more than 30.000 armed
men in the field at any time. According to
the British War Office there were no Ios3
than 250,000 Encrllsh soldiers in South Af
rica to subdue this handful of Boers. Mr.
Hillegns gives an excellent account of the
Boers' method of fighting. He says that
their generals cannot compel thorn to go
into a fight, but that the commanders
ri'ust call for volunteers whenever a. bat
tle is imminent. The author spent four
months with the Boer forces, and ho has
written a book which is quite different
from the usual war booka. None of thÂ»
matter in the book has appeared in print
before, and almost all of the many Illus
trations were taken by himself. ' "The
Boers in War" is uniform in size with
"Oom Paul's People." anil those who rÂ«*nd
that study of the South African patriots
will find the new book a fit companion
piece and more interesting than the for
mer volume.

A volume of short stories of rather more
than usual Interest has Just been written
by Lieutenant Brady of the United States
Infantry. The book is dedicated to the
telegraphers of the country and seems to
be the outcome of personal experience.
The title, "Tales of the Telegraph," shows
the subject, and the scenes, taken from
the West, picture the life of a lonely op
eratorâa life spent in midst of dreary
deserts or on the tops of distant moun
tains, where he must subsist entirely with
out comfort, yet assume the heaviest re
sponsibility. All 'of the stories are inter
esting and one or two are decidedly dra

is one of the prettiest stories of the group.

rude stage of adobe and stones had been
made at the farther end of the kiva. Upon
it were growing stalks of corn and shoots
of bean plants, tnat-flourlshed.ln.com-
There were a aozen snake Images,
carved and painted with remarkable real
ism. They were lying near the growing
corn. 'They were five and six feet long,
three or four .inches in girth at the
largest parts. The painting on them gave
a startling and eerie appearance. No one
was allowed to approach nearer than about
ten feet to the grewsome effigies, and no
one ever handles them on pain of dread
ful punishment, unless after appoint
ment by the watch priests for participa
tion In the annual ceremony of feeding
the "sacred serpents." The heads of the
Images were as large as a man's, head,
and evidently of wood.. The eyes -were of
a peculiar green, that gave them a shock
ing gleam even in the darkest part of the
stone chamber. There were contriv
ances by which the eyes of the effigies
were opened and closed as quick as an
electric flash and without the least sound.
The mouths could be opened and shut
with an ease that was astonishing. There
were two rows of shining white teeth in
the mouths, and long, forked, blood-red
tongues were shot forth from the throats
of the snakes. . The bodies were painted
exactly like huge rattlesnakes. Even the
scales of the reptiles were reproduced
with a fidelity to nature that caused some
shudders to the palefaced spectators.
At the sudden beating of a drum-like af
fair that sounded similar to a Hindoo tom
tom, the performers , of . tho night- came
running; . in from an adjaoent apartment.
For about half an hour this performance
lasted. In a second the serpents' heads
were withdrawn and the pandemonium of
noises ceased as if by magic. The tom
tom was a^aln beaten as another signal,
the curtain was lowered. There stood the
growing green corn. The performers, now
sleek and dripping with perspiration, once
more ranged themselves at the side of
the stone platform and began new dances
and feats in leaping and howling. It was
now past midnight. The Indian guide said
the ceremony would not cease until day
light, and that several of the dancers had,
often kept up such extreme physical eser
tloa. tor two- er thre* days a.t a tin*.
The naked, brown-.'klnned dancers, wttlÂ»
their lank black hair hanging about their
faces, the monster snakes thrusting their
heads far out through the curtain, with
their gleaming teeth and their red
tongues; the masked figure holding one
of the largest under one arm while he fed
it with the other; the man struggling: with
one serpent while he strove to push aside
the head of another, which was reaching
out to seize him; the horrible combination
of sounds from behind the curtain â all this
by' the dim, flickering light of the- fira
burning in the center, at the midnight
hour, in a subterranean cavern hewn out
of rock, made up a thing of weird horror
never to be forgotten. The effect was the
result cf an Ingenious mechanism oÂ£
springs Inside the. bodies of the snakes,
with clever kictir.g on the part of thÂ© per
formers; but the illusion was perfect.
Suddenly there was a furious beating of
the tom-tom, and the dancers disappeared
behind the curtain as quickly as they had
appeared: THen two Indians came out
with a long pole. and. having deftly fast
ened cords to its ends, drew it up to the
celling. 'Attached to this pole was some
flimsy fabric that acted as a curtain in a
theater, and shut off the view of thÂ«
stage when it was up. In a second a hush
cama over the assemblage, and every onÂ»
that was concealed rrom >ic- oy an in
geniously arranged curtain of some fab
ric as to resemble the wails of the kiva.
There were twenty-eisrht dancers, and
they were all stronc limbed, tall and ath
letic Indian braves of* between the ases of
IS and 30. They were nude except for
breechcloths of skin, but painted with
white and yellow. Strings of turtleshell
rattles were tied about their ankles. At
another series of taps on the tom-tom af
fair they ranged themselves at the front
of the raised stage, and then, upon an
other signal./ began a slow, weird dance
movement in perfect unison. The rattles
at their ankles were moved in exact time
to the words and rhythm of their song.
The Indian guide whispered that that
was the way the female water snake was
called to see what they were doing to
please her. Other dances, songsâ In differ
ent time and movementâ but all of them
slow and monotonous, followed for an
hour or more. The spirit of each of the
savage invocations was rain, and much
of It.

voice is rp.pable of and noises made on
Jndian mu>ieii! Instruments. The stono

Indeed very much frightened.
The noises had continued for a moment
or so when, at once, the serpents which
had been carried behind the curtain dart
ed their enormous heads through the holes
in its lower part, rno at each hole. They
camo out, head and back and almost half
their length- moving their heads from slda
to side as if singling out a spectator fop
attack, their white teeth gleaming, their
jaws opening wide and again closing with
a snap and their red, forked tongues con
stantly darting in and out of their
months. At the same time the performer
who had taken the snake under his arm
seemed about to be overpowered by It3
strength. It struggled to escape, twisting:
Its ugly neck about his arm, dnrting Ita
tongue into his very face, and then, rear
ing up. would throw itself out with a
mighty spring', so that he had to clasp
both arms around it and preaa it tightly
against his naked bosom to hold it. It
was simply awful. All this time the old
man in the white mask â who represented
the UnlTcrsa] Mother, the creator and
fructitler of everythingâ was moving rap
idly from one snake to another, sprink
ling upon the head of each some of the
sacred meal from the pouch hung at h!3
neck. The snake stretched out their long
necks as he approached, sometimes three
or. four fret beyond the curtain, pushing
their heads against each other and dart-
Ing out their tongues in their eagerness
to get at the meal and their anger at
the delay. As a head was thrust out the
old man would throw his right arm

lick up the m^al which he held out tx> It
in his left hand. As the make turned and
twisted it seemed to require his whole
strength to hold it. as much as If he
were trying to restrain an unruly horse
by thÂ« bridle. At the same time the other
man was struggling with the other ser
pent, the sweat rolling down his naked
body and his muscles standing out like
those on a gladiator. The unearthly cries
and roars behind the curtain new ceased,
while the dancers at their Â«!(!Â« kept up

VALDA'S FIRST MEETING WITH THE
S. O.
VALDA BERISKOFF was the
daughter cf a former Rus?!an Min
ister et the court cf Peking. When
Count Berlskoff married an Ameri
can heiress who was globetrotting In
China he was compelled to leave little
VaJda entirely to her Manchu mother.
The mother, on whom the Count be
stowed the pension which backstairs eti
quette has established as proper from a
Minister and wMose connection with a
foreigner It wa.s fortunately possible to
conceal, was sold, together with her pen
elon. to Shenc: Ta-jan, a Chinese mandarin
of the second class, who bc-'onged to thÂ«Â»
General Council and had the entree of
the Forbidden City. This mandarin hap
pened one day to get into trouble
through a. chip or scratch on one of the
twenty-five seals which passed through
his hands, and was thrown into prison,
during which misfortune he vras bled to
the extent of several hundred dollars a
Cay for the necessaries of life. As he was
not a rich man ruin stared him in the
face, when he was suddenly released, re
instated, and Foon after promoted. His
Manchu concubine had bribed a Manchu
member of the Inner Council In his be
half. What the sum waÂ«, where rhe had
obtained Jt and by what means she had
"placed" Jt her husbsr.d did not know, but
he Immediately married her and then
gradually admitted her to his confidence
until she obtained an entire ascendency
In the household. In this way little Valda
began l!fe with the advantages of a Chi
nese education. She was also initiated at
an early ace into the mystery of palace
Intrigues, for she became the medium of
communication between her mother and
the Russian legation.
Valfia was not. of course, her Chinese
name. Nor am I cure that it wa* Rus
elan; but we will let that pass.
When she was 10 years of age her Chl-
t
nese life came to an abrupt conclusion.
Valda's mother, being a Manchu. had not
permitted her child to be crippled, and
at this time she was beginning to ride
abroad In a tomboy fashion which scan
dalized her Chinese stepmothers, but
which received the cachet of approval of
a Manchu Prince of sporting proclivities.
One day, having left her groom to drink
wine and play cards at a suburban guard
house, sho was enjoying an evening
gallop all by her lone in the direction of
tho Imperial Hunting Park, when she
was overtaken by three young foreign
ers returning from their Sunday outing
In the hiiLs. They had just taken on
l>oard the last of many stout and cham
pagnes (a favorite Peking beverage), and
were inclined to have some fun. (The
child's equestrian eccentricities had been
talked of in the mess, and she was sup
posed to be a precocious nu-chi.)
Mounted on strong cross-bred ponies,
fed on beans, the young men easily
caucrht up with Valda's little pot-bellied
mare and began to crowd her, with very
Immature Chinese jests picked out of
BtenL Valda had a high spirit, as well
as a malicious humor, and retorted not
only with some choice repartee as culti
vated in the women's quarter, but with
her whip as well. Then one of the young
men, a handsome and stalwart youth In
deed, snatched her off her pony and kiss
ed her. Valda fought wildly and fell to
the ground, spraining her ankle. Her
captor dismounted and, unaware of her
hurt, teased her almost Indecently while
his companions eat on their ponies roar
ing with laughter. They were all mere
boys; one a student Interpreter of the
British legation and the others Junior as
sistants of the revenue mess, six months
out from Europe.
Suddenly the two stopped laughing; the
other, looking up at them and then over
his shoulder, whispered: " :
"Good God. the 'S. G.!' "
Tho two dismounted and the third stood
"If the Tsung Shui-wu Ssu has found

communications with the Russian, em

When four big men In the livery of the
Superintendent General of Revenues
tipped little Valda out of a big official
chair in front of Sheng Ta-jen's residence
there wn.Â« consternation In the household.
What It meant Valda could not under
stand; when first her mother and then her
stepfather cross-questioned her over and
over again as to every word that had
passed between her and the S. G. she
began to think that, she had been guilty
of some fearful impropriety. But . the
secret of It all was simply this, In the
words of the mandarin to his wife:
Valda told him the name of the man
darin she believed to be her father, and
the S. G. lapsed Into silence.
"The honorable father Is a military
officer?" In China personal questions are
polite.
"I am not Chinese," sho said, still
sulkily, for all foreigners were as yet
barbarians to her. "I am Manchu. My
mother comes from beyond the wall."
"It Is rather unusual for a young Chi
nese lady to ride abroad and alone. Is It
not?" he said gently, as if he would ex
cuse the ' misbehavior of his fellow-for
eigners.
Hl3 Chinese was perfectâ Just as perfect,
both in accent and form of address, as a
native's; so perfect that Valda scarcely
noticed the incongruity. All she noticed
was the voice, grave, gentle, winning,
fascinating.
In the meantime the 8. G. had caught
Valda's pony and replaced her In the
saddle. In ordinary life he was. known as
Mr. Pericord; officially as the Superin
tendent of Imperial Revenues.
VALDA LEAVES PEKING.
HAPTER IL
Heavily the three young men mounted
their ponies, and, starting at a deferential
Jog trot, soon gave the bit to their Im
patient ponies and disappeared in a cloud
of dust, the only word spoken being a
muttered "Damn" from the youth who
had pestered Valda,
The mild-faced personage did not ac
knowledge this remark, but said: "You
had better ride on, gentlemen. The South
gate closes at 7."
"Good evening, sir," they responded
with suspicious alacrity. And the consu
lar man made bold to add, "Pretty warm,
isn't It, sir?"
"Good evening, gentlemen."
"I don't care," said the legation man.
"Your 'S. G." can't say anything to me.
Thank God, i don't serve under a bloom

now raising his head, touched his helmet

"It's all right," whispered another.

up, and 'all looked as sheepish and terri
fied as schoolboys caught by a master.
The cause of the:r discomfiture was the
appearance on the road, a little distance
off, of a mild, insignificant looking per
sonage jogging along on an old white
pony, his head bowed and his mustache
showing the satisfied smile of a valetu
dinarian who feels that his constitutional
has done him good.
"This means the sack," said Blake, the
prime culprit, gloomily.
Great, Britain possesses numbers of "ob
scure celebrities like these, although none
When a T. Pericord, Esquire, of Peking,
was gazetted In the list of British '.'birth
day honors," when the rumors went
abroad that he had been asked for the
second time to become the British Minis
ter at Peking, with an earldom for a
bribe, people scarcely talked of It; none
knew who he was, or what he had done,
and as the society gabbler dreads nothing
so much as to appear ignorant of other
people's biographies he shunned the topic
of Pericord.
In consequence of this unbroken con
nection with Chinese politics Valda was
never allowed to forget- the hero of her
childhood. The quiet, reserved figure of
the S. G. was always before her eyes,
although he shunned _ advertisement as
sedulously as politicians court it. His
name never appeared in the tÂ»apers. None
outside the cabinets knew of his exist
ence.
During the next seven years Valda was
transformed into a modern Russo-Frencli
society girl. She acquired all tho usual
accomplishments and what was Mongolian
in her was no more in evidence than it is
in pure bred Russians. The only point
in which she differed from her fellows
was in her remarkable aptitude for and
experience in Asiatic politics. This gained
her something like a European reputation
owing to her father's peculiar arrange
ment that she should be periodically In
troduced to the Chinese Ministers of the
different countries In which her education
was carried on. By the age of 15 I think
she was known by sight to all the at-Â»
taches of the Chinese embassies in Ber
lin, Paris and London, and regarded both
by them and by diplomats as a Russian
spy of quite a new and harmless sort.
It Is not usual for spies. to call openly
at embassies. Valda knew twice as mucn
about Peking intrigues as all the Foreign
officials put together and it ended in them
seeking her, not her them. It was a com
mon Jest of gray-haired Ministers to say,
when China came on to the carpet. "We
must send for Miss Valda Beriskoff. *
This flattered the Count. For once the
epithet "Russian spy" became an epithet
of admiration and endearment and gave
Valda a unique eclat when she finally
made her debut In society.
"It happened that within a year of her
return the Count, who was now in the
Foreign Office, had occasion to conduct
some delicate negotiations in connection
with the Kuldja treaty In which it was
of advantage to him to be able to deal
direct with a special Chinese envoy with
out the intervention of the resident Em
bassador's interpreter. In this Valda's
Chinese came In opportunely, enabling
him to score quite a little diplomatic tri
umph. Without any definite prosj>ects for
her future he nevertheless saw the possi
bilities of the case und was careful, in
the scheme of her education, to provide
against her entirely forgetting her Chi
nese. Nothing more was necessary, than
that she should hold a brief conversation
with one of her fellow-countrymen every
few months and this was easily arranged.
VALDA'S RETURN TO CHINA.
CHAPTER III
Every woman can probably picture to
herself just how the girl felt as she fol
lowed him; ,the unrelenting blush of
shame, the Impotent self-hatred, the sen
pation of being dragged by her pony'3
tail rather than carried on his back.
When they passed through the gate she
relieved him of her company without a
word, and turning up a side street, roSe
furiously through narrow alleys followed
by a pandemonium of imprecations from
the coolies whose stalls or burdens she
upset.
And that was the last impression Valda
carried away with her of the city of her
birth. Through the agency of the Rus
sian legation she was placed in the Jesuit
Foundling Convent at Tientsin for a year
to teach her French, after which she was
packed off to lier father in St. Petersburg,
he having of his own initiative sent for
her in the interim. His wife having died
and left him her fortune without other
incumbrar.ces, the, Count had determined
to seek out his Chinese daughter to amuse
his declining years. When he saw how
remarkably handsome and Intelligent Kh-j
was, ha decided to adopt her and gave her
the best Continental education.
The S. G. was really bored, if he was
not positively annoyed by this tactless in
trusion; but his almost feminine intuition
showed him the child's perplexity, and
with a good grace he resigned himself to
the complete interruption of his thoughts.
The only discourtesy he ua&tl was the one
best calculated to relieve the strangt; girls
embarrassment. He took out his watch
and discovered that it was'inuch later
man he thought, and therefore suggested
a canter.
"My ankle?" That was all poor little
Valda could say. Something so much less
simple than a forgotten sprain was pain
ing her, but she coulU not then inter
pret what it was. And so she said
nothing and wished she had died before
fche had accosted him, while at the same
time keeping timidly by his side because?
she could think of no other way thata be
ing swallowed up by the carui by which
she could excuse herself on that desolate
road.
"Thank me, my childâ what for? A"h,
now 1 remember your lace; It is fur me to
ask pardon for my discourtesy in forget
ting it. I trust your ankle no longer paind
you?"
Mr. Pericord brought his old pony to a
walk and dismissed the cares of state for
the winning suavity which his enemies
called "soft soap," but which was tne
quiet, unaffected kindness of a great and
gracious nature.
"Ta-jenâ pardonâ but I want to, I must
thank you. v Forgive, please forgiveâ the
small one's impertinence."
Valda gazed after the bowed figure on
the white pony with a feeling which
choked her; a disappointment that was
despair â a stupefaction which a child
might feel who was struck by a passer
by. Then, stung by her innate daring
and impulsiveness, she smote her pony
smartly and overtook him.
"Ching, young master," he responded,
gravely, as he passed, but so absently
that he mistook Valda for a boy.
The S. G. raised his eyes. He was riding
In a brown study, for he was about to
bring off his great coup in the opium con
vention, and the affair was so delicate and
audacious and involved such an immense
change in the revenue that in spite of hla
Napoleonic power of closing the door of
his brain during this brief hour of relaxa
tion he could not dismiss the subject from
his thoughts.
In this trepidation Valda was kept a
close prisoner for a week, with the result
that one afternoon she slipped away with
out telling any one and waylaid the S. G.
on his customary constitutional.
"Ching, Lord," she accosted him,
humbly.
"To be under the eye of his Hankow
commissioner," said the lady, bitterly.
"How can you escape his vigilance if once
you rouse his suspicion. The network of
his agents extends to the four corners of
the empire."
must go down to my home In Wuchang
at once, wife."
THE WALLS OF PEKING.
Valda, as a child, had traveled from Pe
king to. Tientsin by boat, a leisurely four
days' journey. She returned by rail in
four hours. Somehow her hereditary in
stincts told her that this thing was ab
normal, not of the soil. When she found
that the line terminated as soon as the
long squat walla with their uncouth tow
ers brcke the sky line, the uneasy fore
boding was confirmed. It was a viola
tion of traditions as venerable and Im
movable as those walls that swift artifi
cial traction should cut an unheeding
path through the feng-shuis of graves
and antiquity which hallowed these bar-
ren plain.". If only (some passionate mis
giving cried within her) the noisy an
achronism had been able at once to carry
itself right through that barrier, tho spell
of seclusion might have been dissipated
forever. But there ahead still couched
the squat, grim monster of the ancient
city, intact. Bardo'nical. gazing with Us
blank mud brow toward the arrested in
novation, sluggishly cherishing the an
cient backwardness and all its vast mys
j/rlous potentiality of resistance and re
sentment. Valda knew the city and its
people; born there, the sluggish foulness
of its poverty and .millions rested a remin
iscent groundwork for her Intuitive com
prehension of its character and senti
ment; and as in advance she pictured to
herself, behind the flat gray mound, the
mazy panorama of miles and miles of
narrow winding alleys, swarming with the
antlike industry of stolid crowds, it seem
ed to her that the steel rails and im
bedded trestles over which the steam
horse thundered were mere ephemeral
cobwebs, spun only to be swept away.
Valda- expressed a wish to hire a native
cart to carry her through the Chinese
city to the Chien Men, instead of using
the buggy which the Minister had sent
to meet her. Valda's origin had, of
course, been sedulously concealed, and it
appeared perfectly natural to the attache
who escorted her that this, charming
young woman should be curious to see
Chinese Peking before immuring herself
in the aristocratic avenues of the Tartar
city.
The jolting cart, with its rude and 'com
fortless utilitarianism of construction, re
stored Valda to a sense of home-coming
which the railway, the mode of travel to
which she had been accustomed for the
past eight years, had entirely failed to im
part. This was China: this was the Im
memorial civilization of tho East based on
the only primitive foundations of expe
dience and economy. Trained in culture
and luxury as she had been, she now felt
a scornful contempt for the showy ex
travagances which Western civilization
had grown to depend on as indispensables.
And then she smiled on her companion
and said, with a charming shudder;
"What hopeless barbarity everywhere!"
CHAPTER IV.
After a year of futile efforts the Count
entirely lost his temper. The alliance
meant everything to him. Its defeat meant
ruin, lie told Valda that she was illegit
imate, that he intended to disinherit her.
and that the best thing she could do was
to bo back to China and marry a coolie.
Valda took him at his word and raid
quietly that there was nothing she would
desire so much. The Count had an apo
plectic fit and died soon after.
Valda returned to China as the ward of
the Russian Minister at Peking. She had
a good wardrobe, a sparkling presence,
Parisian accomplishments and the grand
style. Peking, with its attaches of every
nationality, is not such a bad hunting
ground for a portionless belle, and Valda
could have made a better match than
her origin warranted if she had desired
ar.d her guardian had approved. 3he did
not', , however, marry.
â¢ Stfie youns Russian took her place, of
course, in the holy of holies of Peking

which trouble these worthy goodftllows,

But to the Count's amazement Valda
refused to obey him. She said she did
not want to marry. The Count. s-?riousiy
alarmed, questioned her very closely, but
could discover no symptoms of a clandes
tine love affair. The girl. In faci. showed
a supercilious indifference to all the" hand
some gallants whose names her father
tentatively introduced. What was th<:
meaning of this? The girl was incompre
hensible. Scmply, sho did not want to
marry at all. Incidentally the idea of this
Prince. filled her with loathing.
When Valda was seventeen years of age
the Prince PaulOBkoflC Tomsk: (I am sorry
I don't know the correct, way of writing
these names) sought her hand in ma'r
riagc. The Count, to whom the proposal
was made, was delighted. It was the
crown of his life's ambition. He Informed
Valda of the honor awaiting her and de
sired her to arrange the date of the cere
mony without delay, as the Prinoe was
liable to die at any minute. I don't sup
pose he told Valda this in so many words,
for the Prince made up well enough to
deceive a girl as to his age and the dis
ease which was destroying him did not
admit of detailed description.
In this way the memory of the S. G.
was perpetuated in r.tr growing mind; a
sort of dream,' crowded down by bare dry
facts of colorless reality.
And as, year after year, year after year
went by and still the Tsung Shul-wu Ssu
remained tha chief name to conjure by in
all the Chinese embassies, she began to
think that she must have been mistaken
in associating it with a person win had
Interested himself in her. The name must
stand for some ancient and immovable in
stitution like that of the Board of Rites
or of the Dragon Throne itself. It could
rot refer only and individually to a slight,
mild-faced, middle-aged man with a
gentle voice and absent-minded eyes, who
never went anywhere except to sneak out
by the side door of his fu for a timid
amble in the dusk of the evening, who
had been afraid to say a word to his own
employes, and who, it was said, had no
other way of amusing himself than by
shutting himself up In a back room and
playing a melancholy big fiddle.
But to Valda this name possessed al!
the significance it possessed up and down
the coast of China and in the palaces of
the Forbidden City.

were her feelings when her guardian began
to hint that she herself was expected to
use her charms on behalf of Russian

THE S. G.
VALDA'S SECOND MEETING WITH
CHAPTER VI.
But If the young men practiced and
hoped, what of the wives of secretaries
and assistants who had intrigued to ob
tain a transfer to Peking for tha express
purpose of offering their charms to the
retiring grass-widower? It had come to
be accepted as the duty of all married
women in tho revenue service to forget
their modesty when the chance presented
Itself to obtain their husband's promotion,
by a little bit of flirtation; and every ono
in Peking except the S. G. himself knew
that every woman attended his receptions
with this avowed intention. In. fact it
was whispered that they even ca3t lota
among themselves as to whose turn It
should be to monopolize tha bashful old
bachelor and Inveigle him Into his con
servatory.
And now It was that the S. G., tho
Veiled Prophet of the Revenue Myth, ad
the young consulars delighted to dub him
to their chums of the I. K. D.. came ouc
of his shell and condescended to show
himself once a month at a public dinner,
and even to be at home to callers once a
week. Every young man who could play
a- musical instrument was^. now to havo
the chance of a lifetime of attracting tho
personal attention of the S. G.. and anec
dotes were revived of all the "careers"
that had been made by a happy knack of
the banjo or a fluty mouthing of the
clarionet.
But it was not till the winter came,
cutting off Peking from all the world by
its barrier of ice in the Gulf of Pech'.ll.
that the brilliant little society of Legation
street was thrown entirely on its own
resources for amusement. The opening
of the skating rinkâ the flooded tennis
grounds of the Peking Club â Inaugurated
the three months nf isolation with a bril
liant display of Chinese furs, both on tha
caps and cloaks of the high mandarins
invited and on the muffs and jackets of
the foreign women. Sleigh rides, tobog
gan parties, soirees and ball3 replaced
the languid garden parties and picnic
excursions of the oppressive summer and
for the rest, all the world (a few hundred
persons at the most) depended on the S.
G.'s fortnightly courier service for tho
mails from Shanghai.
The next day Valda borrowed one of tha
Minister's ponies and rode ou: along the
Tungchau road alone. She returned de
jected. Whenever she could escape thÂ«s
round of gayeticsâ the tennis parties and
afternoon teas at the Peking Club, tha
picnics to the hills, the undress uoudoir
calls, the official receptions â she rode out
if possible alone: but whether it was be
cause the your.g men of tha messes al
ways happened to be emerging from their
"barracks" just as she parsed, or be
cause the dust blinded her, or because sha
found the country too squalid and unin
teresting, the effect of her gallops seemed
only to be depression and weariness, ar.d
she soon abandoned them. It was only
by accident that she learned later thac
the S. G. had been out of tha capital,
summering at a coast resort called Pei
tai-ho. And he returned, as he went, un
announced.
"I don't think he has accepted an in
vitation for the last five yearsâ since ha
relieved himself of â rs. Pericord'd dicta
torship. They do say he takes a consti
tutional occasionally, but if so he man
ages to slip out of the city by a tunnel or
an airship, for no one ever encounters
him."
"Oh, Cinderpan? He's only one of th*
royal family, a vice assistant temporary
acting secretary or something of the sort,
who relieves the great man of the onus
of performing the common courtesies of

kept in good humor, but as to condescend

oh, you cannot expect that of a man who
collects the revenue of the Chinese em
pireâand keeps his own private band."
Valda smiled charmingly. She seemed
to find her companion's wit full of enter
tainment.
"Then does the S. G. never go out.
"You did not tell me there had been a
change in the head of the revenue ser

wearily.
"I don't suppose I did. If I could have
told you that I could have as easily to!rt
you that the Great Wall had taken unto

Valda turned on him quickly: her eyes
flashed with painful eagerness. "But

act as host la not the Superintendent

born?"

eron. What Co you think of thr> S. O.'s
private musicians? The man divides hli
time equally between them and the rev
enue, and they say the revenue runs it
self while the S. G. runs the band."
Valda scarcely glanced at the old
young man (hl3 face was that of a boy.
but his hair was prizzled at the sides): a
feeling of bitter disappointment beset her
and she turned her eyes away with such
a look In them as a woman might wear
whose life dream had bten cruelly shat
tered.
Valda entered the beautiful grounds,
hung with endless chains of paper lan
terns and idealized by the soft strains of
the famous band, with <i fluttering un
easiness which contrasted strangely with
her habitual self-assurance. tSh<j was re
ceived by a florid young man with a
Scotch accent. "We are delighted to wel

clumsiness.
Valda blushed indignantly and turned
away. She understood the insinuation
and was not shocked at her guardian's
indelicacy, because she was accustomed
to the manners of Russian noblemen: but
it hurt her that even diplomatic scandal
could associate the least suggestion of
sensuality with the face which abode in
her memory as the type of goodness.

and invitations poured in on her. every
salon being eager to ciaim this new at

French legation, a dinner at the British,
a hill picnic by the students' mess, were
organized in her special honor within the
first fortnight; but the Invitation which
alone excited her anticipations was a
plain, unpretentious card bearing these
printed words:
SOCIETY IX PEKING.
CHAPTER V.
"With all my heart, If by so doing I

would swallow up Russia in half a cen

Into Asiatic politics you seem to possess

"Never!" said the captain sharply. "I
for my part would sooner let loose the
whole flood of fanaticism which is brood
ing like a poisonous miasma (he waved
his hand toward the crowded alleys) all
around us in a million secretive hearts
than see Japan paramount at Peking."
"And be yourself Its first victim, most
likely," said Valda scornfully.
"Or New Tokio."
"Oh, they will pass, they will passâun
til they do pass. We must put up with
their airs for a year or two longer, I sup
pose, until Peking is called Alexander
burg."
"I am afraid you have not a very good
opinion of your fellow Europeans in Pe
king, Captain Vassilich."
"We should be absolutely frivolous If It
were not again for that solemn-faced gen.
tleman I referred to just now. Somehow
one can't come within a block of the man
without feeling either choked with an at
mosphere of statistics or chilled with an
atmosphere of secret reports. The poor
fellow lacks what these prigs of English
call our 'Muscovite Veneer.' He wears a
worried look, to quote the ghastly vul
garity of these student boys."
'â¢So that is what you think yourselves?"
laughed Valda, rallying.' "Are you so very
gay, then?"
"Come, come," said the attache' gallant
ly, taking advantage of the gloom to press
her hand. "That is not exactly the spirit
in which a debutante should look forward
to the most brilliant little coterie of fash
ion to be found east of Moscow."
"I don't Ilka to think of It," Valda
murmured with a shiver. "Suppose, with
out war or a siege cr anything like that,
the crowd were to turn against us; the
legations, I mean? What hope of escape
should we have?"
"Revolvers for us and arsenic for you,"
replied the Russian.
They were by this time passing under
the long and gloomy tunnel of the gate.
"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here."
whispered Valda. as if afraid that the
guards should ever hear her.
"Well, there is the population: you
can't exterminate that. Ten thousand or
fifty thousand men (they would have to
keep together) wouldn't cover a square
incli on a chart of a city '.ike this. There
are walls all around them which can't be

"What do you mean by a death-trap?"
"You seem well up In the topography

prise. "But you have touched the kernel
oÂ£ the matter: It la that we count on if
we should ever have to hold Pekingâ
against other powers. An enemy once
within the walls, but outside the Imperial
wall, would be in a death-trap. Peking
could only be taken by starvation."
"There would still remain the Imperial
City," said Valda. halt to herself. "And
the palace after that."
"The walls could be defended at any
one point?.! he replied, indifferently. "But
they have a circuit of twenty or thirty
miles, so. that it would not be difficult to
tcale them somewhere â if one had 100.000
men to spare for simultaneous assaults
from half a dozen quarters."
Valda was astonished. "Do you mean
to say that Peking would be capable of
standing a siege?"
"The people who sidy that imagine that
Chinese walls are the same as those of
medieval cities of Europe. Granite or
brick walls are merely death-traps to
those behind them. Mud embankments
fifty feet thick are advocated nowadays
as the only protection against shell tire.
That is what these walls are, only they
are too high and these towers are ex
plosive targets. When they lave been
battered a little they will form a ridge
over a hundred feet thick, in which even
siege shells would bury themselves."
"They do say so," sneered the Russian
attache, "We* have a habit of despising
systems we do not use."
-""But I suppose it is true that these
walls could offer no resistence to artil
lery?"
"They fcay these huge walls serve no
other purpose than to keep out the fresh
air." she said pensively: "that they would
be worse than useless for defense."
Half nn hour before Valda had looked
forward to the wall as to an old familiar
friend, harmless and homelike; now its
awful antiquity and strength crushed her
with an unspeakable sense of foreboding.
The barrier to the civilization of the
West: the rampart of the prejudices of
the Kast: and yet folding in its massive
womb a brood of the very snakss who
were plotting Its downfall. The ugly
simileâ Valda knew Milton and Dante
better than Chu-Tza or Menciusâ had
scarcely occurred to her than she repented
it revulsively. and, thinking softly of the
man whom her companion had called a
solemn-faced dullard, felt hopelessly that
her metaphor should have been that of
angels hugged in the embrace of a cobra.
A shadow fell over the cart. Valda
looked up and shuddered. In fr^nt of
thorn, po close that it seemed that it might
fall and crush them, loomed a vast clifT
like embankment, a square tower of un
couth solidity squatting heavily alone. It
was the city wall. Sheer from a rubbly
basi it towered, gray and crumbling, yet
massive and inscandible; far as the eye
could' reach it stretched away on either
hand, clean-cut and straight, solidly but
tressed, ponderously yet symmetrically b?
towered. In front of them the black
arched mouth of a tunnel, appearing in
proportion to the cliff it pierced a mere
burrow, yet wide and lofty enough to ad
mit three loaded camels abreast. Scat
tered on either side of the road, a suburb
of caravansaries, mat sheds, reed huts,
dwarfed to the proportions of beehives
and eueumfcer frames.
"Oh. the British Minister docs not
alarm us," replied the young diplomat,
"with a smile of approval for his compan
ion's intelligence. "Our stumbling block is
Mr. Pericord, the S. G. I. R. D. Fortu
nately we have the assurance of Holy
Writ that no man can live forever, or the
impregnable persistence of this solemn
faced dullard would drive our Minister to
despair."
"The S. G.," murmured Valda softly.
Then s,he lapsed into silence.
"So? They told me that Sir Claude had
succumbed unresistingly to the precedent;*
of Sir Thomas Wade."
"But for one man we should dictate the
Yamen's policy, annex the land, and
monopolize the trade of each district in
succession as soon as we were ready to
assimilate it."
"Ah!" Valda remembered. Intrigue â a
patient relentless purposeâ International
rivalries forever wrestling In mortal strife
beneath the tranquil surface of stereo
typed courtesies â and behind, in the back
ground, gaping with vacant grin, the
countless millions of China, "storing up
beneath their apathy an energy which
might submerge Russia itself in the flood.
"Our Influence Is already paramount, I
hear?" suggested Valda.
"We shall change It all -when Russia
rules Peking," responded the attache.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
14
VALDA A ROMANCE
OF PEKING(Continued Next Week.)
At that minute tho great man, In his
great green pagoda-like chair, carried low
down by four bearers using swing-poles,
was borne out, obsequiously followed by
his fat conical-hatted pipe-bearers and
the high-booted and leather-aproned of
ficers of his escort; and behind them
Valda reached at length the spacious
compound which Inclosed tho Yamen of
the superintendency general. Here at last
there was an air of bustle, which caused
her hastily to shrink Into the shadow
of the opposite wall. A squad of soldiers
were stamping about in the street to keep
their feet warm, their rifles carelessly
stacked In the middle of the road, with
huge lanterns bearing monstrous Chinese
characters on their paper globes, slung
haphazard from the muzzles. It looked
like a group of goblin giants. The men
were Chili braves, tall, stout fellows
even when stripped; but In their loose
winter uniforms, thickly padded with
cotton wool, their legs swathed In padded
leggings, their heads picturesquely muf
fled in huge black turbans, they were
swelled out to twice their bulk. A couple
of shabby Manchu ponies stood dejected
ly by the wall, with high-peaked wooden
saddles and massive brass stirrups: half
a dozen tawdry sign-boards on poles were
leaning lop-sldedly by the gate, their
ragamuffin bearers In conical red hats
squatting in a circle hard by and surrep
titiously smoking. Valda learned, by the
big gilt letters on these wooden standards,
that the mandarin for whom they were
waiting was none 1 other than the Treas
urer of Chill, an official second only In
Importance to the Viceroy.
The few belated passengers she passed
intensified the oppressive mystery and
silence, for they gilded by like wraiths,
their hands hugged in their sleeves,- their
faces muffled in cowls or hairy ear-flaps,
their backs bent to avoid the icy blast,
their footfalls deadened by the thick felt
soles of their shoes. Valda attracted no
attention, because she was cowled in- a
native feng-mao, a combined cap and
cape which is held by a visor-like flap
across the chin. Overhead the stars and
moon shone down with an electric bril
liance, marking' the city In white and
black squares as rigid and clear cut as a
checker board's.
Valda also had her dinner served In
private, but she did not eat. While her
French maid was enjoying the savory
dishes. Valda was out on foot alone in
the bitter cold, which was not so Keen as
the cruel chill at her heart. Now she
hurried, now she hesitated and half
turned back, while always she shrank
close to the shadow, dreading that even
the bright moon should detect the purpose
of her errand. The streets were entirely
deserted at this hour, and one might have
taken Peking for a vast uncovered cata
comb, so silent, so untenanted, so white
and death-like looked Its eye\ess avenues.
Everywhere, on either hand, nothing wai
to be seen but plastered and painted
walls, and crisp and glittering snow. No
lighted windows or hospitable doors broke
this still monotony; Chinese houses of
any pretension never abut on the side
walk, but sequester themselves behind
stucco walls whose "very gates are again
blinded by a pieee of wall in front.
VAI.DA CALLS ON THE S. O.
CHAPTER IX,
"Oh. It will spell ruin for him. I sup

must be cleared out. Above all, a devoted
servant of the Czar (such as I myself, for
Instance) must stand In the shoes of Mr.
Pericord. Now I must write- my dispatch
for to-morrow's courier, dear. I shall
have dinner served In my study."
"What will be the ultimate effect of our
policy on Mr. Pericord?" she asked quiet
ly.
Valda looked at her guardian steadfast
ly: had he been less preoccupied with his
diplomatic reflections he might have
thought that she had aged by ten years
in a day.
He hesitated; then he kissed her on the
brow. ,
"But sometimes you will come to see
me. dear friend," he whispered.
For full a minute they stood silent In
the warm darkness, hand3 pressed In
hands; Valda striving with her sobs, Mr.
Pericord carried away with the incense of
second youth.
"Wait here," said Valda prettily, re
luctantly and slowly drawing her lingers
out of his. "It is altogether too cold for
you to return in so thin a coat. See, it is
snowing. I will bring you a robe."
She ran out of. the room. M. Pericord
turned toward the fireplace. A bit of
paper in the fender caught his eye and he
picked It up. "Xiuchwangâ now," he read,
in the familiar hand of the Russian Min
ister. 9
When Valda- returned, bearing a splen
did overcoat of sablo belonging to her
guardian, Mr. Pericord was, leaning
against the mt/ntelplece with bowed head.
His attitude was full of 'fiMzue; the
ellmpre she caught of his face In tne fire
light seemed haggard and wrinkled.
"You are tired?" she said gently. "I
wish you could stay all night."
The>S. G. allowed her to wrap him In
tbe rol-.e.
"Die*, you say that I was to come to the
side gate in Tung Chlao street?" she whis
pered, looking up in his face affectionate
ly, as a daughter might, with her hands
en his sleeve. "But I shall be so afraid
of disturbing you when you are busy."
"Ye?, better notâ better not," he replied,
coldly 'and absently, and moved to the
l'nor.
Vulda stood tottering, as if some one
had dealt her a cruel and treacherous
blow. She looked after himâ but bitter
rebellious tears blinded her beseeching
eyes; she tried to call to him, but her
voice was choked.
"Valda. you Reserve the Grand Cms?,"
said the voice of her guardian behind p her.
"I happened to overhear a little of your
conversation with your visitorâ on Man
churlan politico, I think it was; nothing
else reached my ears, I assure you. Of
course, it was quite a confident'al conver
sation, and no possible blame can attach
to you if Mr. Pericord should Inadvertent
ly have said things which he would not
say to me. All is fair in diplomacy and
Peking, you know â you have heard th>*
saying before to-day. I see. You have
cleared up one of our mest vexa'Ious
doubts. You liave enabled me to learn
something of the most vital Importance.
I perceive that the United States' open
door circular, irstead of being an empty
'bluff' unbacked by nny of the military
powers. Is. on the contrary, the indication
of a definite conspiracy to defeat our ac
quisition of Manchuria. A secret all'ance
exists against us of a far more formidable
character than 1 imagined. A desperate
remedy becomes imperative. We must ep
penl to the 'last resource' whPe England
still has her, hr.nrls full of Egypt and
Africa and the United States is tied up
with Aguiraldo and the Bryanites. A
war nowâ yes, even a riot and reprisals
no matter what, so that we can get an
army into Peking and remove '.',
"You are unkind," said Valda sadly,
without making any motion to detain him.
Blake turned sharply, a blush of shame
fighting with his wounded pride. "I am
a brute," he replied. "Forgive me. Your
intention was of tho kindest."
â¢â¢Come, come," murmured Valda. slip
ping her hand timidly to his arm' and
looking up at him with a reproachful shy
ness, "must you be so harsh toward a
little trick like that? For punishment *
But the S. G. slowly turned his back
on him as If he had not heard and walked
pensively away.
"Pardon me If I leave you here. Miss
Beriskoff," said Blake, haughtily. "You
have friends at hand; I have not."
"Let me assure you, sir," stammered
Blake Indignantly, "that had I been
aware â "
Blake started and turned deadly pale
he understood why Valda had decoyed
him thither and drawn him on to confess
himself. The S. G. had been standing
immediately behind them during the Inter
view In conversation with the British Em
bo ssador.
"Machine." said a gravely gentle voice
behind them. "I am afraid you would bo
right. Miss. Beriskoff." ,
"Now If Mr. Pericord could have heard
that explanation and not take, fcteps at
ence to repair his injustice." said Valda
vivaciously, stepping quickly aside from
her position between the curtains, "then i
should really believe wh'tit every one says,
that your S. G. is not a man, but a â "'
"That. I am ashamed to say, is the very
truth:" he said eagerly. "I had been out
to the hills with a consular man who in
sisted on mixing stout with my cham
pagne, and as I had virtually never taken
anything more intoxicating than a Ver
mouth and bitters I simply didn't know
what I was doing. And yet I am well
aware that what I did was the very
gravest fault In the revenue decalogue â
or.e which, If the native feeling had been
as hostile then as it Is now, might have
seriously compromised the service. I give
you my word. Miss Beriskoff, that I havo
not touched wine since that day."
"I expect you had been drinking."
A murmured conversation on the other
side of the curtains had ceased; Valda
raised her fair arm to the portiere as If
to prevent her companion from looking
beyond.
"What was your fault?" she murmured,
with a soft lcok which stirred the blood
in the young man's pulses.
"L would rather not tell you." he said
awkwardly.
"I did not say co, but you have read
my purpose," he replied with renewed
eagerness, "The S. G. might ignore me
for twenty years without shaking my firm
conviction in his Justice and generosity.
I was a poor lad. without Influence or
ability, when be nominated me to the
service on the petition of my mother, who
had no introduction save the rumor of
his goodness; and if my punishment has
been over-severe for a trivial fault, I do
not forget that the S. G. has the cares of
an empire on his shoulders as well as
hundreds besides myself to keep an eye
on, and I acquiesce in the inexorable rule
that In the revenue an assistant must
never incur suspicion."
Valda, who has been imperceptibly
steering her partner backward toward
the portieres of the card-room, suddenly
came to a standstill. "Now. what was
that you wore saying? Tell me again; I
am extremely interested in this mysteri
ous service of yours."
"1 see that I have made myself ridicu
lous" he said coldly.
"So, no! You were saying that you
had faith in your chiefâ that you meant
to rehabilitate yourself."
"Well, you see, I have had only one
promotion in seven yours, and that is
always a suie sign of disgrace in our
service, when the chief Is known never
to lose sight of the meanest of nis 600
assistants. And thtn. until my leave
carre. 1 was kept for unusually long spells
in the two worst ports in the Yellow Book
â Hainan and Pakh jiâ in fact this is my
first transfer north since I was sent down
tight years ago. Most mÂ«n are generally
expected to resign when they receive this
treatment. I have returned a year before
my leave was up, and that in the face of
a very cold letter from Mr. Pericord sug
gesUng that after ir.y prolonged residence
in malarial district' he would have sup
posed that 1 should wish to reside in
Kurope indefinitely. But, you see, I have
faith in the justice of rny chief. * ? â¢"
"It Is not that," he replied, "although
it is true that 1 only returned from
leave a month ago. I used to know
a good many people when I was at
Peking btfore, and there are several
members of my service up here who
have been statlur.ed at the same ports
as myself during the last seven years.

posed to he in the S. G.'s black books.
When a man has once got that sort of bad
name his friends are prone to give him the
cold shoulderâ at Peking."
"But what makes you think you are
in his black books?' (Valda said "his" as
if to her a.s much as to Blake there was
only one "he" in China).
"You dance very well." she said. "How
is it that you appear so Isolated here?
Are you a new arrival?"
A bright rmile broko up the gloom of
the- mans face, and he offered her his arm
with alacrity.
Valda remarked especially this expres
sion of devotion in a young man who s;tt
opposite her. whose strong and handsome
face wore an air of seitieU melancholy.
He iooiicd lihe- or.e who bore patiently an
unmerited injury, because he was con

came to her that this was the very boy
who had Miatch<bÂ«I her from her pony ani
kissed her eight years before. After din
ner it was ihe custom to dance, many
guests coming in later for that purpose
only. Seeing her melancholy vis-a-vis
Â£taiiuir,g alone near her, Valda assumed

betrayed the habit of the recluse. And

"Oh, what have I done, what have I
done?" she cried wildly, when at last
she could control her sobs. "Two hours

the name of friend. You yourself invited
me to use the privilege of this entranco
whenever I could sparÂ© the time to see
you. I come tp tell you something of
To his astonishment, Valda burst Into a
passion of tears. How was he to know
that this simple offer recalled the begin
ning of her life's secret, and recalled It
with a contrast which nearly broke her
heart?
"Experience has compelled me to fore,
go receiving private revelations, I regret
to say, Miss Beriskoff. I am not the less
grateful for your thoughtfulness. Will
you allow me to send you home in my
chair?"
"I did not imagine that you could treat
a woman quite so cruelly, Mr. Pericord.
I haver compromised myself by this un
usual call in order to give you some In
formation which I have Just learned and
which concerns you vitally. But I should
prefer, not to mention it here where you
are liable to be Interrupted."
For a moment she stood looking with the
incredulous reproach of a pet animal
whose advances nre repulsed. Then her
woman's pride came to her rescue and
she said wearily:
"Yes. Miss Berlskoff?" he said. He car
ried the robo she had lent him on his
arm. "You are going to a party and
found that you need this, perhaps?"
The door opened mechanically, admit
ting her to a small anteroom, where she
seated herself, aware, that she would bo

that there v/as nothing necessarily clan

was so pestered by lady petitioners that
it was the only means he could devise to
protect his precious time and save them
the annoyance of being told that he was
not at home in the presence of official
visitors.
Valda was kept waiting for what seemed
to her hours, and .her courage dwindled
to misery. Then Mr. Pericord himself
entered, and this Increased her wretched
ness, for she fully expected that he would
at least invite her to his drawing-room. If
not to bis sanctum.
Fortified by these reasons, though still
trembling with painful doubts, she turned

bowed the solemn tingchals of the S. G.,
who closed the gates as soon as the rab
ble got under way.
Then Valda was alone again Jn the
deserted street, like a shivering angel shut
out of paradise. She knew that Mr. Peri
cord could not yet have had his dinner;
she knew that her visit at this hour.' so
soon after parting from him, alone and In
stealth, would bear the worst construction
in his eyes, and her tortured heart still
felt the dull wound oi his inexplicable
rudeness on leaving her. And yet It was
Impossible that he could have meant any
thing. Their conversation had been so
sweetly intimate; the pure kiss which he
bad pressed on her brov.- had been a com
pact of enduring friendship on hi3 part
and a yearning love on hers. Perhaps ho
iiad been preoccupied hy the thought of
the visitor waiting for him at home; her
momentary absence from the room hart
allowed him to remember the pressing
calls of duty. If by .my chance he had,
in rehearsing the confidences they had in
terchanged, conceived a seldom absent
fear of indiscretion â if he had remem
bered that the fascinating young woman
was still the ward of the Russian Min
ister, his secret enemy; well, the news,
that Valda was bringing to him . now
would dissipate all thtse suspicions and
prove at once the thoroughness of her
devotion.
"You are right," he said gravely. "My
visit will certainly be misinterpreted. And
yet I don't think we have mentioned poli
tics once, have we, unless It was some
teference to the future of my pet port
Niuchwang. You see it is seldom I am
able to meet any one who does not talk
politics. There Is an atmosphere of Asiatic
intrigue about Peking which affects even
the women. You will keep yourseif un
spotted from Its taint, will you not, rny
child?"
Valda, with a sob, lifted her face to his.
"Let him wait, sir," she answered. "Ton
can always rule China, but it is not often
you can forget that China exists. Some
times I wish It did not â when I see how it
monopolizes you. I am Jealous of China.
And I know very well that It will not per
mit you to call at the Russian legation
again."
"Good gracious, did I say a few min
utes? Then the treasurer of Paotlng must
have been waiting at the superintendency
for an hour! What excuse shall I mak3
to him. Miss Ber'lskoff?"
He looked at the clock.
"The best of friends must part, I sup
pose," he smiledâ he was never conspicu
ous for originality. "I am sorry to go.
I have enjoyed myself more during these
few minutes than during many years,
Miss Beriskoff."
At last, with a sigh, he rose.
Mr. Pericord was, long before this, talk-
Inog to the girl as to an old friend; it was
rarely Indeed that he could unbosom him
self to a sympathetic listener, for a man
In his position is denied the luxury of
friends. And so here he sat In the pleaa
ant gloaming, forgetful of time and'en
gagements, greedily If unconsciously ab
sorbing this brief spell of sympathy and
homeliness and allowing himself to talk
as unreservedly as if intrigue and diplo
macy were unknown.
She knew that her guardian was listen
ing, and that she was expected to com
mence her despicable task at once. Drop
ping the paper into the fire, as shu
thought, with a sigh, she tactfully
brought the conversation round to the po
litical embroglio In Manchuria.
"Nluchwangâ now."
And these everlasting fears of intrigue
were n<?t without reason. A note had been
brought in to Valda by a Chinese servant,
which bore these words:
Mr. Pericord remained for two hours;
before half this time had elapsed the ru
mor of this unprecedented visit had
Kpread not only to all the other tea tables
of Legation street, but into the Forbidden
City itself, whither certain magnates of
tho Tsunp, II Yamcn were swiftly and
secretly bidden, to. inform the Dowager
Empress what was meant by this pro
longed stay of the Tsung Shui Wu Ssu
at the Russian legation.
The room was dark save for the fire and
the dim glow of the braziers and the dull
winter twilight that crept through the
heavy curtains. Tea was broughtâ tea in
tall glassr*, with lemons and brandy in
lieu of milkâ but that was the only inter
ruption of their privacy. M. de Samovar,
If he was in the house, refrained from
coining to welcome his distinguished vis
itor.
"Ah, you continue to fling at my head
the idle talk of the young men about my
severity. Miss Beriskoff. I envy Mr.
Blake his champion. Would that I could
find as fair an advocate to take my part
sometimes." .
"Oh. Mr. Pericord," she answered im
pulsively, stretching eagerly forward to
take his hand, and then drawing back In
confusion; "I would do anythingâ for
you."
"Do come near the lire, sir," she said
humbly: "you are shivering. It is I who
am overwhelmed with my audacityâ my
paucherie. I Â¦was afraiu I had put myself
irrevocally in your black books."
"I am afraid. Miss Berfskoff," \io. be
gan at once, standing near the door with
his old hat in one hand and the other
streteheo. over one of the charcoal bra
ziers which stood on either side of the en
trance, "1 am afraid I did not sufficiently
Show my appreciation of yourâ your,
ahem, reparteeâ I mean the very proper
snub you administered to me for never
having called on so charming a young
lady. Is it too late to repair the discour
tesy?"
He had humbly requested the fur
smothered Ccssack to convey it to J.l}ss
Beriskoff. Valda, looking through a win
dow, Kmi'ed as she saw the thin and
threadbare gray overcoat and round hat
of a style long dead and buried; the
wardrobe, one might think, that the poor
young; Scotchman had brought out with
him in the fifties. It was so characteris
tic: every one else was muffled In costly
furs and continually receiving fresh cases
of boots ond hats and collars and coats
for fear they would fall behind the fash-
Icn, but the greatest man of the .'(im
munity, when he took the astonishing
step of calling on a mere woman, could
llnd nothing better in which to array him
self than these relics of his youth.
On the following afternoon there was a
rorr>motion among the servants in the
Russian legation. The Tsung Shul-Wu
Ssu had called ir. person. -His greatness
was represented by a diminutive slip of
pasteboard whit h had the air cf having
lain in a drawer for twenty years, and
which bore in antiquated style the simple
kger.u, "Mr. Pericord."
THE S. G. CALLS ON VALDA.
â¢CHAPTER VIII.
Insist that you shall take me to the buffet
and pledge me by breaking your pledge,"
Blake, overwhelmed by coquetries to
which he was an utter stranger, suc
cumbed like melted wax.
"Why have you done it, why have you
done it?" he whispered incoherently as
they left the buffet; the glass of cham
pagrne had gone to his head.
"Oh, I like to make allies," said Valda
airily. "I suppose you are in love with
me now?"
Blake did not reply.
"Once but. twice shy. I see," she said.
"Ihe la.st indiscretion left an abiding im
presjlon.*'
"Soil do not know what that indiscre
tion was or you would not tempt me."
Valda laughed mischievously. She rc
meml.ercd the occasion very distinctly. A
reckless joy seemed to have seized upon
her and to bo tingling In her veins with
tho exuberance of her childish gallops.
Why was it? Why was she so nappy;
why did even the memory of this young
man's rudeness seem like bright sun
shine? She had found himâ fou.id tnc
hero of her dreams; the searching; quiet
eye; the lov.\ melodious voice; the stead
fast, magnetic handâ all had remained un
changed by time as if waitingâ waiting for
her return, a child no longer, but a wo
man. She looked again at Blake, her
hero! Yes. it was through him that i^hi 1
had found her hero; and perhaps that
was why the young man also appeared
Charming in her eyes, as if he rolicctea
the nuhle im:ise of his chief. I
"Do 1 not?" she said, with a sparkiinir
Clarice. "Perhaps a 'little bird' â "

the mysterious agency which toll him
everything that was going on In every
junior revenue mess all over ihc empiio
âwas the standing joke par excellence in
Peking.
"You make too much of a trifle." he re
plied, evidently dlstrejsed. and astonished
at her claiming a long acquaintance. "I
have not by any means decided to repu
diate the friendship which promised so
much more solace to me than you can
imagine. I wished only to hint, without
hurting your feelintrs more than neces
sary, that the many years that I have re
sided in Peking have compelled me to bo
skeptical. Private communications, es
pecially when emanating from certain of
the legations, have so frequently proved
the reverse of disinterested that I hÂ»**~
been compelled to make a rule nÂ«it to lis
ten to them. And. as perhap3 your friend
Mr. Blake has told you, rny rules do not
admit of exceptions."
"You think that 1 a:n M. de Samovar's*
tool â a spy. perhaps?" she said with a
low-voiced scorn, which might have con
vinced a man of stone.
"I>et i!^ avoid all politics. I beseech
you!" he replied, deeply moved.
She went close to him. iind taking his
reluctant hand, turned her Hashing eyes
full on his.
"I insist on knowing why you suspect
me, Mr. Perieord."
He looked at her distressfully, and then,
suddenly recaptured by hts habitual dis
trust, or perhaps reminded of some in
trigue just imrnrted by the treasurer, he
withdrew his hand.
"Since you insist, here is the proof of
your duplicity. But, as I said before, I
wish to overlook it. if you will grant me
this one favor, of avoiding all allusion to
political affairs. I shall still endeavor to
deserve your friendship."
Reluctantly, but with a grave sfcrnnes*
"But whyâ why? I will not believe that
it is simple rudeness; I have known you
so long! Tell me the reason of it. Mr.
Perlcord. I implore you, tell me. before
it shall be too late for us to recover the
sympathies of this afternoon!"
"I am compelled to. Miss Berisicoff."

That he is Inherently without the ability
to Judge between right and wrong would
seem evident from the open way in which
he has perpetrated his misdeeds. To do
the wrong thing was to do the natural
thing for John Chretien. Almost invaria

Again and again he has good-naturedly
admitted crimes which any other man
would keep under lock and key. "A moral

Twenty-five years ago he was a young

strayed into politics and was soon up to

The reason why soon leaked through club
doors. He had introduced into the club

The trick was discovered and his resig

Mr. Chretien's first dinner in Jail was a
memorable one. Upon request, as Is tho
rule, he was permitted to send outside for
his meals. A waiter from a neighboring
Italian restaurant waa brought to; Mr.
Chretien's cell, or boudoir as he calls It,
to make arrangements. The waiter re

With his oily fingers he spread the feast,

his father's estate he openly boasted of
1 purloining a bankbook with a credit 01
$5000 intended for his mother. This is cer
1 talnly the most unworthy deed on ths
long list charged up to John M. Chretien.
The story of his attempting to black
mall a young married, woman, and after
ward, at the point of a pistol, retracting
the charges. Is too well known to need
repetition. But so are all his other mis
deeds. Pocketing half of Manager Fraw

and when the performance was almosi
stopped by order of Daly, he denied that
he had ever received a cent of the $900.

would hardly a^mit of augmentation.
Certainly his spirits are as high as ever.
Word that an interviewer was awaiting
him in the office brought him down the
e-teps three at a time, rather puffy from
the descent, for Mr. Chretien has more
embonpoint than is quite reconcilable
Â¦with the established ideas of grace. In
deference to the warm weather or a
r.egiertful laundryman he wore neither
collar nor cravat. Mr. Chretien's counte
nance, wreathed in smiles and triple chins,
was as merry as merry could be.
"The other gentlemen in my boudoir are
having a warm discussion," said Happy
Jack, "so I was glad to leave them. Oh,
r.othing seriousâ they are both gentlemen.
One is an absconder and the other is In

good fellows."
Mr. Chretien is well aware of the fact
that his good spirits and sallies of wit
ere sources of wonder and amusement to
the jailers. There is something very
Â¦whJmsieal in his defense of his unfailing
good humor. "I obey the jail rules and
they treat me well? so why .shouldn't I
be merry."
The shame and disgrace of It all never
occurs to him.
The corner of a book poked out of his
pocket and Mr. Chretien confessed to an
Immense amount of reading. "Th's 13

THE SUNDAY CAlil,.
16yond the belief of those who think
indifference the chiif ingredient in
Chinese make-up.
The story of Kwang Hsu, Emperor
of China, is indeed a rare one. He
dared break the ironclad traditions cf
the royal family. He stands a soli
tary and unique figure in a dynasty
that for four thousand years has
wielded a conservative scepter.
Kwang -Hsu, despite birth and train
ing, in an incredibly short time.be
came an ardent reformer, chancing
even his throne for the cause.
The story of his conversion to re
form has bÂ»en written specially for
The Sunday Call by his friend and
fellow-student, Leung Kai Tin. Tong
Chong, editor of the Chinese reform
paper, rendered the Chiness of Leung
Kai Tin literally into English.
It is a peculiarly interesting pen
picture of the most remarkable Em
peror in the world â Kwang Hsu â
written by one of hi3 most remark
able subjects. Certainly Leung Kai
Tin is THE most remarkable China
man who hes ever visited San Fran*
cisco.
I AM probably the only person who has
ever visited th!s country who has had
the distinction of having had personal
communication with Emperor Kwang
Hsu. The same was accorded me becausf.
I was a pupil of Kang Yu Wei, and ono
of the echolars whom the Emperor gath
ered about him during; hlB six months of
busy reform.
The Emperor to a man of marked in
telligence, but physically anything but ro

sion 'almost effeminate in its refinement
and a smile of remarkable sweetness.
It has been during his short period of
power, for the first time in 4000 years, that
China has experienced the privilege of an
honest, patriotio ruler; a man without a
desire for his personal self, caring only
for the welfare of his subjects.
I I was exiled with my brother and all
others of the Emperor's supporters who
could be informed in timÂ«* by that worthy
iruler, who suddenly realized that the
tcraah was coming. Six of our companion*
He Was a Fellow-Student of Emperor Kwang Hsu of China
This and other arguments convinced
Yung Hong Wo and he too became an en
thusiastic reformer, faithfully repeating
to the Emperor every word uttered by
Kang Yu WeL The Emperor appreciated
it all, for this scholar had been his most
faithful and trusted instructor for many
years.
In a. short time the Emperor became a
sound reformer himself, and as a reward
for Kang Yu Wei's wisdom ordered
a royal decree that reform be proclaimed.
This greatly displeased the Dowager, who
managed to secure the dismissal of many
ofllcials who favored the decree for re
form, some of whom were the Emperor's
trusted advisers. This had the effect of
retarding the movement for a time, and
Kang Yu Wei left Peking on a lecture
tour through all the provinces.
At the close of the twenty-third year
of the reign of Kwang Hsu, when the
Germans took possession of Kiaochau
wan, Kansr Yu "Wei immediately re
turned to Peking from Canton and ex
plained the seriousness of the situation,
but he was refused an audience, all offi
cials also refusing to forward his message
to the Emperor.
But he at last found one named Ko Sit,
who whs in thorough sympathy with
Kang Yu Wei, who took It upon himself
to see the Kmperor and ask him to Issue
an order giving Kang Yu Wei a personal
Interview.
The Emperor was about to comply when
Prince Kung went to his Majesty and
begged him not to do so, saying: "Kang
Yu Wei is a man of low rank and there
fore, according to court etiquette, has no
right to appear before the Emperor."
Tho Emperor explained to Prince Kungr
that he wished to consult with Kang Yu
Wei on a matter of great importance.
The Prince said this could be accom
plished through some palace official, -who
might carry both message and answer,
thereby saving the dignity of the court.
The Emperor was compelled to accede to
this, for It was in strict accordance with
an ancient and well-defined law. -
The Emperor was anxious to hear Kane
Yu Wei's message from some one he could
trust, so he requested the president of the
Foreign Office to meet Kang Yu Wei.
which he did. Kang Yu Wei explained to
that high official bis Ideas on the subject,
Leung Kai Tin, though still in his
twenties, is a man of marvelous abil
ity. He is a scholar, not only learned
in the musty philosophy of the Ori
ent, but well versed in the history of
other nations and what has made
their success. He is an eloquent
speaker, and his lectures hare to his
countrymen have stirred them be-
Leung Kai Tin came to the Pacific
Coast to carry the doctrine of reform
to every city and village where his
brother Chinese congregate. In San
Francisco there are an especially
large number of progressive Chinese,
who believe that the light of modern
civilization should penetrate the
gloom of China. Their battle-cry is,
Give back the throne to the young
Emperor Kwang Hsu. They would
have the Empress Dowager divested
of every vestige of power.
Six of the most promising advo
cates of reform were butchered at the
instigation of the Empress Dowager
before they could make their escape,
but Kang Yu Wei, Leung Kai Tin,
Leung Chi Tso and several others
managed to escape.
When the Emperor saw that his
reformers had endangered his own
safety and that of his advisers and
that matters were nearing a crisis he
sent a secret message to Kwang Yu
Wei, informing him of the peril that
was threatening all reformers. He
bade them fiy at once.

and dangerous task.
were beheaded as coon as the Dowager
seized the reins of Government and hun
dreds of others imprisoned for life.
Twelve years ago when Kang Yu Wei
Â¦was a teacher at Canton, he spent most
of hl3 time explaining to his pupils how
the great nations, had reached their state
of perfection through gradual reform, in-
Fisting that Japan was made by the same
process.
He taught them that the only way to
succeed was to induce their Government
to reform. As soon as his -theories be
came known to the Government at Peking,
Kang Yu Wei was pronounced insane by
the ofllcials there and a determined effort
was made to suppress him until the Em
peror had reached the twenty-first year of
his reign.
It was during the Chino-Japanese war
that Kang Yu Wei sent a petition
covering hundreds of pages to Emperor
Kwang Hsu; explaining all his ideas and
theories on reform, lie begged his Ma
jesty to lend an ear to his pleadings, in
sisting that China's futuro safety depend
ed solely upon reform.
When the Emperor read the petition he
was pleased beyond measure and at once
ordered hla secretary to make copies of
the instrument, one for the Dowager and
one â¢each for the Governors and Viceroys
of the various provinces, which resulted
in a terrible Jealousy springing up against
Kmig Yu Wei. Again Kang Yu Wei ad
dressed the Emperor, which the officers
refused to forward.
But Yung Hung Wo. the old teacher of
the Emperor, was so taken by the modern
ideas advanced by Kang Yu Wei that he
began searching for books of modern
times to see if they agreed with the opin
ions of Kang Yu Wei. He was surprised
at the revelation and immediately ex
pressed his great respect for the wisdom
of the reformer â especially his expres
sions on conditions existing in Japan and'
Korea, which he found verified by other
works.
Next he Invited Kane Yu Wei to come
to Peking that he might better explain
his theories and Kang Yu Wei exp'alned
to the Emperor's instructor as soon as he
reached his presence:
"All the powers are threatening each
other. Unless we reform, what standing
can we claim as a nation?" t- Â«â¢<>Â¦..

Such a dignitary is Leung Kai Tin.

has been shanghaied and murdered
60 often by the Empress Dowagerâ
eccording to report â that he has be
come shadowy and unreal to most
minds. He has been killed and res
urrected regularly for many moons,
until the uninitiated have doubted
whether such a person as Kwang Hsu
ever existed.
Leung Kai Tin's presence, in a
measure, is a guarantee to the incred
ulous of the reality of Emperor
Kwang Heti. The Chinese residents
needed no such evidence. While
Kwang Hsu was in power his sweep
ing reforms made his subjects fully
telling him how necessary it^waa to re
form, that the nation could In no other
way establish a standing with the Govern
ments \if the world.
The effect of this message upon the Em
peror was astonishing, lie expressed hla
belief that such noble sentiments could
only come from an honest, faithful and
wise statesmanâ one who might be trusted
with any undertaking for the nation's
pood. He ordered the president of .the
Koreign Office that In future alt commu
nications from Kang Yu Wei were to be
forwarded to. him without a. moment's
delay.
This gave Kann Yu Wei the opportunity
which he had locked so long and anxious
ly for. He was now in direct communica
tion with the Emperor, with a fair chance
to propound to his Majesty the principles
so dear to his heart and lay bare the re
sults of his life's study. In doing so he
committed but* one serious error. He al
lowed his enthusiasm to get the better of
his judgment, thereby furnishing the
Dowager the only weapon sl.e could use
against himâ for he, suggested reforms s^
sweeping that In a country bo conserva
tive as China it was an easy matter to
turn many of- the Emperor's friends
against him. - Â¦
At last Yung Hung "Wo managed to in
duce Karig Yu Wei to write a memorial
to the Emperor, with, the result that his
Majesty concluded to make some of the
great changes as suggested by. the re
former. .
Further the Emperor was so taken by
the writings of Kaftg Yu Wei that, de
spite all court etiquette, ho expressed a
desire to meet . the writer personally,
which was most -vigorously opposed, by
Prince Kunpr.. but fortunately the Prince
died soon after.
Then came the "consultation with the
Emperor, resulting in a complete victory
for Kang Yu Wei < and -reform, for the
Emperor agreed with every section^of the
written requests of "the' reformer.
Again and again the Emperor requested
the presence of the reformer, wishing
further advice. Finally. In order to have
him within easy call. -he- : appolnted him
to a position in. the Foreign Office.- - This
caused more -Jealousy -. from Bome of the
Puking officials., ... ........ i
Some time previous to his' meeting with
the Emperor Kang Yu Wei hsd organ
ized a government i protective society,
which was bitterly opposed . by. Censor
"Wong, but the Emperor refused to listen
to the objections of this official, which
very much exaggerated the bitterness
against Kang Yu WeL
Another censor named Mon also sidad
with Wong, doing all in his power to In
jure Kang Yu Wei. with the Emperor.
Ills llajfsty then Informed Kans Yu
Wei that it would be better if they wera
not to meet so frequently, because ths
opposition was becoming dangerous â that
their affairs had better be conducted
through correspondence, for a time at
least.
Kantr Tu "Wei then devoted his tlmÂ» to
the writing of a number of clever books
on the subject of reform. He explained
how Japan had been saved by timely
changes from their old Ideas; how Russia
End Prussia haU been rejuvenated by able
statesmen, and in order to show the result
of Inactivity he drew the attention of
readers to what had occurred to Poland
and India. Both had lost thetr all aa fc
result of their stupidity and Inability to
appreciate a future. .
As it was not considered safe that too
much shf>uii be known by outsiders re-
KArdirtf ti> relations.with Kang Yu We!,
the Â¦ JCwjf^or appointed four personal
f.-iend: iu tct r.a letter bearers; two wero
old pupils of the reformer, and all could
be trusted.
Some of the officials became so enraged
over the Emperor's Intimacy with tho re
former that they even requested the flc
struction of Kar.g Yu Wei, my brother
Leunsr Chi Tso. and myself. Instead of
complying Â¦with this request he listened to
Kp.nff Yu Wei. and In three months or
flered over twenty rartf.-al changes in the
laws of the empire, among them the com
plete revisal of the criminal and civil
rodfs, all to- be rearranged on tho plan
of these used in civilized nations; estab
lished schools lor. the acquirement of for
eign languages and colleges for military
training; abolished the bow and arrow
training; ordered the followers of thÂ»
eight banners to support themselves In
times of peae*Â»: established silk and tea
exchanges; abolished the old form of Con
fucian examinations, substituting the cus
toms in vogue In England and America;
encourajred a free press, and gave every
subject permission to address tho throne
regardless of rank or title.
Â¦ Owtng to the diabolical plots of the Era
press Dowager, Kwang Hsu is now in in
activity. But we are doing our best to
spread the doctrines of reform so that all
Chintse shall see the necessity of a change
from the -old ways. As soon as Kwang Hsu
can be located, and there is no danger that
he has been killed, he will be given hla
throne. Then his reforms will bring about
such changes that China will take hÂ«*
rightful place among nations. â¢â¢ -*
realize that a new hand was wielding
the royal scepter.
But ever since the usurpation of
power by ths wily Empress Dowager
they have lived in constant dread
that Kwang Hsu would be hurried
to an untimely end..
Leung Kai Tin is reassuring on
this point. The complications In
China, he declares, will stay any mur
derous intentions of ths L"mpres3
Dowager. Moreover, crafty as she is,
she must realize that any such viola
tion of the sacred order of succession
would only completely destroy the
power of the IÂ£anchurian houss.
Leung Xai Tin ovrcs the proud
privilege; of his psrsonal communi
cation -with the Emperor Kwang Hsu
to the fact that he is a pupil of Kang
Yu Wei, greatest of Chinese scholars
and reformers. It "was Kanrj Yu Wei
who first started the reform bee buz
zing in the royal bonnet. The young
Emperor finally lent a listening ear
to the teachings of Hang Yu Wei.
He became a pupil of that great
teacher. This naturally made the
Emperor eager to meet the most
brilliant scholars of Kang Yu Wei.
Among 1 the young men brought into
the royal presence were Leung Chi
Tso and Leung Kai Tin. Leung Xai
Tin was the younger brother, but
equally clever for his years, and an
ardent reformer.
When jsalousy mads It imperative

the tale of the strange happenings In the

him a short distance outside of the village,
where the country was perfectly open.
Buddenly there appeared before them a
thin, long torgue of flame. At flrst It was

curious windings till It reached a height of
twenty-flve feet. Its tint changed from
white to red.Â«and thea to yellow. For a

ground and crawl like a snake. Again It
would dance and whirl swiftiy. But al
ways it maintained its general onward di

yard, where It disappeared. Professor
Fabani watched it night after, night. lie
reports that the flams appeared almost
every night as soon as darkness came, and
that the flame appeared to have a differ

it. Often it moves directly into the teeth
of a gale, and snow and rain fall to ex

absolutely to find anything that could
account for it. He was unable to touch
the strange thing, for the flame avoids ap

pursue it have their labor for their pains.

much lighter, being far removed from the
destructive influences of surging waves,

nothing of anchors of vessels, which arc
so destructive to the shore ends of all

When the cable was coiled into the ship,

and the publishers are acquiescent in

write are apparently ivelcomed in
these, quarters, and I am grateful,
because their publication brings
nearer the fulfillment of my ambi

nations than Japan with a new
knozvlcdge of my country's career

Certainly not!

that the law of California

be supposed to bar a Japanese from
such a marriage as mine. I am
confident no such intention was in

does well to be humble in his honey

himself most favored among gods
and men, but at the same time it is
hardly permitting justice to the
family of which I have the honor
to be a member to allow the notion
to obtain in the minds of such
Americans as have interested them
selves in cur vuirriage that a Jap
anese gentleman may not be worthy
of the hand of the best woman that
walks the earth in any land. It
pleased heaven to make the family
to which I belong one of the Sa

centuries its members have been
among the good and zvise and great

And I cm not sorry for many rea

Adachi. comparatively Ignorant of Ameri

Imagine, it you piease, the feelings of
Adacni and his maiden fair, with ,this
prospect ahead of them. .
The District Attorney of Los IVngeles
County was consulted bv the framic Jap
anese lover. The clerk agreed to issue the
license so ardently craved, if the attorney
chojlld so advise. But the attorney hesi
tated. Then Adachi poured In broadside
after broadside of argument to prove that
the most expert ethnologists do not regard
tho Japanese as Mongolians. All the dic
tionaries and encyclopedias had to say on
the subject was at Adachi's tongue's end
and Attorney Rives got the benefit of It.
But still he was obdurate.
who would bar a Japanese gentleman
from his true love just because tneir heart
tirst beat under thru rent tluga.
li California law forbade rus marriage
to one of ita daughters, why, there ara
other States than California, and other
lands, even, than the I'nited States.
But a short hundred miles from Los An
geles is the bonier line beiween California
and Mexico. The law-makers of old Mexi
co never cared to impose any restrictions
on the marital propensities of their peopla
tor th*> foreigner v.ithin their gates.
'Soâ
â¢â¢We will go to Mexico, at once.' cried
Adachi, "take v/ith uj a Justice of the
Peace from San Diego and be married at
Otai. just across the border!''
The plan looked good. It savored of
romance, ann TnlXU Epperson was not
aveisc to a bit of genuine romance.
"It seems exactly like a slory, doesn't
it. Adachi?" she said with a little wriggle
of excitement.
"More beautiful than the old romances
of knights and ladies." quoth he. with a
glow that showed even through the bronza
cf him.
"But it's so unconventional and uncer
tain." she demurred.
"Nothing is uncertain when we love and
will." he blazed en. He is a poet, you
know, and It is *aid that they always
make love very nicely. They have a way
of winning out.
The maiden's mother didn't know, hesi
tated, was lost.
Adachi was in transports of delight. At
that staÂ«:e he took Oeneral H. G. Otis.
editor of the Los Angeles Times, Into hia
conndence. It may De said, en passant,
that Adachi's tirst stories were given to
General Otis' paper two years ago. Now
Adachi is literary editor of the Times an.l
a favorite protege of the military editor.
He did not think about the romanceâro
mances are not particularly in hia line
but the savor of scrimmage In the affnlr
took his fancy mightily. He twinkled two
thlny eyes under hia big eyebrows ami
he braced himself aa if he were going to
meet Filipinos.
"Let's get ahead of them." he chuckled.
General Otis has abundant resources of
various sorts. His attorney. ex-Unlteil
States Senator Stephen M. White, was at
the service of the young people in tha
matter. The legality of their moves wad
approved by this eminent counsel and by
Oeneral Otis himself.
Then off for Mexico.
But again there rose In the path of true
love more forbidding rocks.
The Justice of the Peace In San Diego
couldn't see his way clear to crossing the
line with these young people and tyinff
an American marriage knot on Mexican
soil. He v.as like the County Clerk and
District Attornej- of Loa Angeles. Noth
ing In the way of handsome arguments
could convince him that the right thing
for him to do was to hie him across tha
border, marry these impatient youngsters
and take his fat fee.
He had always pigeonholed Chinese and
Japanese together.
He was not able to see that Adachi wai
a gentleman and a scholar. To him al
mond eyes, straight hair, high cheekbone*
and dark face told one prosaic fact:
"Jap."
Again there was trouble. While it la
not of record, one can fancy that Adachi
hr?athed a few high-class Japanese- ex
pletl\-es at this legal canaille In San L)itg'>
Â¦who.-e obstinacy was balking the game.
Once again he must devise a plan to
quiet and soothe mamma, her daughter
and push this search for a marriage li
cense and a priest to a swift conclusion.
Ariachl. it will be conceded, was certainly
treading on very thin ice at this particu
lar juncture. In his storie9 of Japanese
knlghts who won their ladies at the point
of the sword, or may be in the field of
some fiercely fought battle, he had man
aged, many a time and oft. to extricate a
hero, sound on every part of his anatomy,
and bearing the maiden of his heart in
safety to the ancestral halls.
But he had never imagined a campaign
where a Japanese knight would have to
Joust with an American State law, strug
gle with pigheaded officials and cajole a
hysterical mother â all in order that the
"light of his eyes,", the object of his de
votion, might become his lawful and lov
ing spoil. /â¢<-
The Mexican project was given up.
Acachi cast one last longing look at the
soil of Mexico and then began anew his
hunt for a complaisant functionary and a
tolerant priest.
The wires were made to burn with mes
sages from him- to the Governor of tho
State and to nls lieutenant, and also to
the Governors of other States. The tele
phone bell rang vigorously at Adachi's be
hest, and communication was established
with functionaries throughout almost tho
entire West.
Then came success.
It came In en Insignificant, unpreten
tious way. There was not a solitary par
ticle of romance at the end. No foreisn
state nor foreign law was invoked to help

hundreds of people the ship May Flint was
suddenly sent to the bottom of the bay

ship Iowa, the crew escaping death as by.
a miracle. Four sailors leaped overboard
and were picked up by rowboats, while
the others were taken off the bark Vi

two vessels camp together, when the May
i-wung round after getting clear of the
Iowa. The May Flint was without a pilot
and was coming into port under full sail
when, owing to a light wind, she became
unmanageable and drifted across tbe bow
of the Iowa. The collision tore a bad hole
in the May Flint's side and she turned
turtle and sank five minutes later.
The May Flint was commanded by Cap
tain Woodside, and in addition to her of
livers, carried a crew of sixteen pallors,

been swept away by the terrible force of
the wind and the rolling up of the water

that all these bridges could be swept away

BTTRTTN', Sept. 8. â I have had a
conversation with, a highly
placed personage of the For
eign Office. He declared that all re-
ports of compromise on the- part of
Germany were false. Germany has
already definitely refused the- Russian
proposals and has informed all the
powers of the text of the note doing
so. It is expected here that Russia,
the United States and France will
evacuate Peking and that America
will be forced to place its gjeat inter
ests in Peking under German protec-
ticn.
Washington political circles have
been unpleasantly impressed by the
indiscreet and sometimes false press
notices. Germany uill not publish
her answer to the powers, desiring to
avoid giving the impression that she
is taking action at the head of ths
powers in opposition to Russia.
It is worthy of remark that the
Wolff bureau has already published
three different versions of the Em
peror's speech at Stettin- In the last
edition the -words "I am convinced
that ay plan will succeed," have been
stricken out. Such is the censorship

Ecknowledg-ed by officials and diplomats

Russia has not Indicated any Intention

seeing- the possibility of friction between
the powers, the increase of starvation
among the people residing between Taku

renewal of the attacks by Chinese upon
the foreign troops and finally of extensive
operations by the allies when Von Walder

trivs about as prompt a settlement of th*>
trouble as events will permit.
Purh promptness will probably not ac

Meanwhile the people of Argentina be
gan to fear that the Chileans would not
accept the decision about th"e Chilo-Ar
gentlna frontier limit question, which had
been submitted to the arbitration c'
Queen Victoria, and as if to support an*
justify their fears it is reported that the
Chilean Government has trespassed upon
the absolute rights of the arbitrator in
Imposing the obligation of limiting the
award to such and such points.
No wonder, then, that amid thla mess
of conflicts the governments axe making
preparations for war. While Chile has
sent to Germany, her favorite general,
Korner, to buy guns and cannons. Peru
The question of the final ownership of
Tacna' and Arica has thus remained un
settled and Chile still occupies the prov
inces, with the deliberate intention.accord
ing to many Chilean papers and political
speakers, of keeping them forever. Still,
many Chileans admit that the "Chilean
lzation" of the two provinces has pro
duced no effect and that they are as
strongly attached to their mother country
as on the day when they were taken from
her. and that the two provinces are eager
ly waiting for the day when they will be
freed from Chilean domination. Peru
makes an appeal to arbitration in order
to settle peacefully the question of. the
final ow/iership of these provinces. And
here comes the point where the United
States and the Argentine Republic are
dragged into the dispute.
The United States Government, having
invited all the Spanish-American coun
tries to participate In the- second pan-
American congress to be held at Mexico
in October, 1&01, must have been surprised
to receive from the Chilean Oovernment
a conditional acceptance. Chile, being
aware that the congress was to proclaim
arbitration aa the only method to settle
International differences on this conti
nent, answered that' it would send repre
sentatives to the congress only., on con
dition that arbitration should apply ex
clusively to future disputes. The accept
ance of such a 'condition, it is pointed
out, would leave Chile free to act as she
pleased with reference to the annexation
of Tacna and Arica.
VALPARAISO, Chile, Aug. 1.â A three-
Sided conflict is in prospect on account of
the Tacna-Arlca question, which has re
mained In abeyance since the treaty of
Ancon, which terminated' In 1SS4, the vic
torious war ot Chile against Peru and
Bolivia. It was agreed then that the vic
tor was to occupy the Peruvian provinces
of Tacna and Arica for ten years, after
which a plebescitum was to declare
whether those provinces wanted to be in
corporated with Chile or returned to Peru.
The date passed off, however, without any
plebescitum being taken. The Chileans
put It oft under this or that pretext^ be
cause, it is claimed, they wanted to col
onize the provinces with their own people
and thus secure a majority in their favor
at the holding ot the plebescitum. It la
asserted that they sent their soldiers and
all kinds of people from the slums o.f the
Chilean seaports. But Peru held that only
legitimate natives of the two provinces
should be entitled to vote at the ple
bescitum and that the method of voting
and the qualifications of the voters should
be determined by a. special, protocol, as
provided for in the Ancon treaty.
Chile at last consented to this in 1S9S,
at a time when - she anticipated a war
with the Argentine Republic and feared
Peru might side with the latter. The Bil
linghurst-La Torro protocol was then
signed at Santiago and approved by the
Chilean Senate. But Chile peacefully ar
ranged her dispute with Argentina, and
her Chamber of Deputies did not even
discuss the question of the protocol,
which, being approved only by the Senate,
remained a dead letter.

Than From Military
Standpoint.
Situation in China Continues Difficult

GERMANY HAS
GIVEN RUSSIA
MANY SEASONS
Other Influences.
Another move which would impel
France to follow Russia if the latter with
draws her troops is the fact that the
French forces would thereby avoid re
maining under the command of Fieldj
Marshal Count von Waldersee. This feel
ing against French soldiers taking orders
from a German commander, while not
openly discussed, is nevertheless very
widely nourished among the people here.
An eye-opener as to the lacK of accord
among the various military command
era in China is furnished by the report
of Captain Marolles, who commanded the
French contingent UP to the time of the
capture of Tientsin. Captain Marolles re
lates each day's events in the form of a
diary, in which appear statements which
a Paris journal describes as tantamount
to a masked Indictment of the' Russian
General Stezel, who. with the obstinacy
of a soldier executing an order, it says,
wished to win or even to be beaten" alone.
The result of this ambition was the loss
of hundreds of lives. Marolles, under
date of June 27, Â¦writes:
"Russians attacked the east arsenal at
Tientsin without notifying any one, but
eventually the Germans and then tho
English contingent had to co-operate,
which was not agreeable to them. It is
apparent that there is no accord among
the military chiefs."
Two days later Marolles writes: "The
Russians made a reconnoissance. on the
left bank, without notifying any one,
when a fusillade began and the town suf
fered an hour's bombardment."
After recounting other Instances of the
isolated actions of the Russians Captain
Marolles says that Juno 30 General Stezel
advised him that he would withdraw the
next day the outpost at the railroad de
pot, which was Indispensable to the
French concession.
Lack of Accord.
The next entry is dated July 4, and
reads: "The Russians evacuated the rail
road depot at 7:50 this morning. As the
post is absolutely Indispensable to protect
the French concession, whose evacuation
would compel the evacuation of the Eng
lish concession, a force of Japanese,
Fronch and English oeÂ»eunied it."
Marolles' report thus shows that there
was no accord, even between the French
and Russians.
The letter of Admiral Seymour to the
French commander eulogizing the splen
did conduct of the French of his Peking
relief force has created a. most pleasant
Impression here and has proved of much
greater value In Improving the Anglo-
French relations than he could possibly
have anticipated. It rekindled friendly
sentiments, which bore their first fruit
this week on the occasion of the visit of
BOO representatives of the Britsh Cham

Â»
PARIS, Sept. S.â France is in a dilemma.
Russia's proposition io withdraw from
Peking has resolved Itself into a problem
for her which French statesmen are now
tackling very gingerly. The complete
withdrawal from Peking, after careful
consideration, is now deemed to be alto
gether In line with France's views, and as
the most effective method of dealing
with the Kmpress Dowager and her clique
of advisers. France is now forced ty
choose between the course she would
rather adopt and the policy dictated to
her by the Russian alliance and
French statecraft has been devoted for
the oast week in an enfleavor to splice
these two conflicting policies into a com
promise which will not Jeopardize her
friendship with Russia and at the same
time wfll not prejudice her own position
in China. The suggestion, therefore,
that while the bulk of troops be with
drawn from Peking a small international
force be still retained in the city comes
as a peculiarly acceptable idea to France.
Russia and Germany appear to be the
only serious stumbling blocks in the way
of a general acceptance of this compro
mise, the first named desiring the totai
withdrawal of- the allied forces and the
latter wishing a continued occupation.
Should the prpposition fall through and
Russia and America withdraw all their
troops France would undoubtedly follow
suit.
Too Great a Shock.
It would be too rutie a shock to the
Russo-Frcnch alliance for France to
abandon her ally and remain in Peking,
with aa her associat.es her hereditary
enemies, England and Germany. The
French Government appreciates the great
element of wisdom in the Muscovite pro
posal, recognizing that a continuance of
ihe 'present form of occupation would pre
vent early and direct negotiations with
the Empress Dowager, who fears to re
turn to the capital, and that, moreover,
the administration of the affairs of the
city would. throw immense responsibility

apparently pursuing a policy of inactivity

of the "flabby, weak-kneed irresolute

iu recent years. By the time Lord Salis

have brightened, reports will have t>een

nounced to him that he was off on a
business trip to Singapore.
He requested that the major, who Is
nowadays called "Father" by the Moros,
look after his people while he was gone.
Major Sweet consented to do all he could,
but trusted that the Sultana, mother of
the Sultan, would be able to administer
affairs satisfactorily. A short time after
the Sultan's departure the legacy of
trouble he had left to Major Sweet devel
oped. Indoman and Tahll left' to work
out their cases to suit themselves, mar
shalled their followers Into the field and
commenced waging an Insidious warfare
against each other. At tho end of twenty
seven days of warfare the combined cas
ualties list amounted to one killed and
two wounded. The peaceful natives, how
ever, were terrified and they soon com
menced pouring all sorts of complaints
Into the ears of Major Sweet at Jolo.
Major Sweet directed Indoman and Tahil
to stop breaking the peace. The two
tribes sneaked oft to thelr'homes. But in
the meantime a practice march of the
Twenty-third Infantry had been decided
upon. With a detachment of almost EOO
men and machine guns Major Sweet left
Jolo and pushed into the hills in the direc
tion of the capital, twelve miles away.
The Sultana sent a messenger to Kajor
Sweet begging him to do no such rash
act. The major Bent back word that no
Moros would be harmed as long as they
remained peaceful among themselves.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON, Sept. 8.â
Gloom pervades the kingdom of Sulu
and tears course down the cheeks of
the numerous wives of tho merry
Sultan. For the Sultaji has disap
peared and has placed, the reins of
government In the hands of Major O. J.
Sweet of the Twenty-third Infantry. Os
tensibly because of his unwillingness to
settle a dispute between two loyal Ameri
cans, Majarajah Indoman and Paglima
Hadji Tahllâ but, perhaps, because of his
desire to reduce the surplus In the Sulu
treasury caused by an Influx of American
gold and money received from a special
tax assessment, and to escape the bicker
ings of his many wivesâ the Sultan has
fled and no Sulu man knows whither he
has gone. It is believed he is In Singapore
enjoying such delights which only occa
sional contact with civilization can afford.
Majarajah Indoman Is charged with hav
ing stolen wives, slaves, fighting t;ocks
and and other valuables belonging to the
subjects of a neighboring chieftain, Pag
llma Hadji Tahll. It Is alleged that Tahll
made reprisals on subjects of Indoman,
but that the latter so far had six to one
the better of the bargain. Then, as the
story g-oes. the Sultan saw a storm brew-
Ing and that If the affair came to him for
settlement, in order to be Just, he would
have to turn down Indoman, so, he Jour
neyed from his capital, Maibun, to Jolo.

our credit of manufactured goods alone of hun

up to thÂ«. first of July.

your kidneys once every three minutes.
fThe kidneys are yeur
blood purifiers, they fil-
ter cut the waste or
impurities in the blood.
If they are sicker out
cf order, they fail to do
their work.
Pains, aches and rheu-
matism come from ex-
cess of uric acid in the
blood, due to neglected
kidney trouble.
Kidney trouble causes quick or unsteady
heart beats, and makes cne feel as though
they had heart trouble, because the heart is
over-working in pumping thick, kidney-
poisoned blood through veins and arteries. !
It used to be considered that cr.ly urinary
troubles were to be traced to the kidneys,
but now modem science proves that nearly
all constitutional diseases have their begin-
ning in kidney trouble. â¢ %

Poison From Pineapples.
The Juice of the green and growing
pineapple is accredited in Java, the Phil
ippines and throughout the Far East gen
erally with being a blood poison of a most
deadly nature. It is said to be the sub
stance with which the Malays poison their
kreeses and daggers, and also the "fin
gernail" poison formerly in use among
aborigine Javanese women almost univer
sally. These women cultivated a nail on
each hand to a long, sharp point, and the
least scratch from one of these was cer
tain death.

BAKERSFIELD. Sept. S.-Hon. R. C.
Dale of Bakerslield, for Assemblyman;
Is'. J. McCormick of Randsburg, Super
visor First District; N. W. Tausig of
Miramonte, Supervisor Third District; G.
J. Plane of Bakerslield, Supervisor Fifth
District. The foregoing were the nomi
nees put forward to-day by the Republi
can County Convention, composed of.
ninety-nine delegates.
There was a sharp contest for each of
the positions, the closest and most heated
being for the place of Assemblyman be
tween Hon. R. C. Dale, present Assem
blyman, and Supervisor C. J. E. Taylor.
Dale won by barely one vo,te. The first
ballot stood Dale 47 and Taylor 48. There
being two ballots unintelligible a second
ballot was taken, with the foregoing re
sult. It was currently talked and be
lieved here .by many that Colonel Dan
Burns' fine Italian had figured in the
convention to defeat Dale for fidelity to
the wishes of his constituents In voting
against the colonel for United States Sen
ator.
Dale was firmly "fornlnst" the push at
Sacramento, and with all their fine .work
they failed to pull him over for Burns.
In consequence of his firm stand in this
he has been dubbed by his friends "Hon
Â»*<?t Bob Dale." Taylor, it is believed,
was "in the hands of his friends" and did
not know how they were using him to
knock cut Dale.
At any rate Dale's friends believe they
have gained a great victory over the
Burnr, push. In the First District there
was a hot three-cornered fight between
McCormick, Chris Worth and John Nell.
It was horse and horse for several bal
lots, when finally Worth threw his vote
to McCormick, who was winner. G. J.
Plane, nominee in the Fifth District, is
one of the principal employes of the tvern
County Land Company, as well as his
Democratic opponent, H. A. Jastro.

SAN DIEGO. Sept. 8.â In an address be
fore the Chamber of Commerce William
K. Smythe, one of the vice presidents of
the California Forest and Water Asso
ciation, said that the great trouble with
irrigation in California was that the laws
were the most ill stifled to the State of
any that could be imagined. The State
was inhabited in early days by those who
came from States where irrigation was
not necessary in mining for gold and the
laws were formed with the idea that the
agriculturist did not need the water in
the streams and that all that it was good
for was for the placer miner.
The laws of to-day should be framed for
almost an opposite purpose.. The placer
miner has so far gone out of business
that it is not his interest that is para
mount and the agriculturist does need tha
water of the streams In order to exist.
Mr. Smythe declared aridity was so far
from being a curse to a State or a sec
tion that it was an absolute blessing if
water could be procured for irrigation.
A branch of the general association,
which is formed for the purpose of trying
to get new irrigation and water right laws
for the State, is to be organized here.
William E. Smythe Says Radical
Cliang-es Are Needed in California.

SAN JOSE, Sept. 8.â The recent dis
patches from the East stating: that the
California Cured Fruit Association is giv
ing foreign buyers an advantage over the
Eastern jobbers is not worrying the offi
cers of the association, who believe
they will have no trouble in disposing of
the crop. In an interview to-day Presi
dent Bond said: "We are not running the
association for the benefit of the Eastern
jobber, but for the benefit of the Cali
fornia grower. California packers can
handle the export trade direct .from here
better than the Eastern buyers. The
habit of the packers of New York to take
California prunes, process them, pack
them with the large ones on top and filling
the bottom with small, inferior fruit, has
discredited California prunes abroad. By
handling the foreisn trade from here our
close inspection will compel only the ship
ping of the best fruit. In order to com
pete with the foreign grower prunes will
be sold in Hamburg for J ,Â« cent less than
here. But they don't get this reduction
until we are patisfied the goods have been
taken out of bond, and cannot be re
shipped to this country without paying
the foreign duty. This can in no way
hurt the Eastern jobber, for they cannot
come in competition with him.
"The statement that we do not control
the prune crop is all bosh. The associa
tion has over 90*,)cr cent of the crop and
nearly all of that outside the association
has passed Into the hands of packers who
will not sell below the association prices.
"If we can sell from 500 to 1000 tona in
the foreign market it will reduce the
stock on hand and the association will be
enabled to get more for those on hand.
The plaJat of the Kastern jobber will cut
no figure with our prices, for the associa
tion will maintain those set and the
grower is the one who will be benefited."

she intended using at home. As she was
leaving the chophouse Bassman attempted
to stop her, and when Mr. Bullard inter

wound. Bassman then turned the weapon
on Mrs. Bullard and fired, the shot pass

A Coroner's inquest was held this after
noon and brought forth the following
facts. Dr. Phillips was called and testi
iied as to the condition of the wound of
the dead man, saying that it would bo
very easy for a person to self-inflict such
a wound, and described how it could be
done. M. A. Billiard was then placed on
the stand and testified as follows:
"Baseman and myself opened the Chi
caso chophouse some two months ago,
and until to-day our business relation's
have been of the most pleasant character. |
Myself and wife had rented the Hewlett'
lodging house at the corner of Second
ami Center streets, and Mrs. .Bullard came
to the chophouse just before the tragedy
and asked for some dishes and cooking
utensils she wished to use.
"These were delivered to her. and as she
was j-bout to leave Bassman jumped from
his seat In the rear of the establishment
and essayed to stop her. 1 was behind
the bar at this time, and stepped forward
and asked what the trouble was, where
upon Bassman drew a revolver and fired
two shots at me. He then shot my wife
through the throat and finished up by
sending a bullet through his own brain,
causing almost instant death. As far as
1 know the whole trouble occurred
through by wife asking to take dishes and
cooking utensils to use in the lodging
house. Bassman <V>Jected and said they
belonged to him and then started shoot
ing."
Otto Hartung was called and testified in
substance that he met Bullard as he
rushed from the house, and after his exit
two more shots were heard in the room
Miss Quinn was culled and substantiated
the testimony of Uartung. The case be
ins: clear to the jury they returned a
verdict of suicide.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAX RAFAEL, Sept. 8.â The prelimin
ary hearing of J. E. King, charged with
the murder of S. H. Church at Two Rock
on July '2?i last, was commenced berore
Judge Rodden here this morning at 10:30
o'clock. King, through his attorneys,
Lennon & Hawkins, won first blood. At
torney Lennon objected to the sufficiency
of the complaint on the sround that it
was sworn to on information and belief
only. District Attorney Mclsaac prac
tically admitted the point well taken by
drawing a new complaint charging King
with murder and haying S. L. Stice swear
to it. King was rearreated by Sheriff
Taylor in the courtroom. The preliminary
hearing- was then proceeded with.
The lirst witness was the complainant,
S. L. Stlce, son-in-law of the deceased.
He testified that on the morning of the
shooting he found King at the barn
watering his horses and that he ordered
him away; that when he and Church'
afterward went to nail up the well near
King's camp they had a tew mbre words
and King- snot Church and took a shot at
him as he ran away. The defence called
many of the prosecution's witnesses and
drew their lire.
Ueorge Armstrong, who searched the de
serted camp after tne shooting, could only
find one empty rifle shell, and Sheriff
Grace of honoma testified that when he
took possession of King's l">-shot rltie it
contained fourteen loaded shells.
Ainqng other witnesses called wer^Mer
man Church. Mrs. Laura Stice. John Hen
shaw and Dr. .George lvancovitch. Her
man Churcn testified that his father wis
unconscious from the timo hi ulgiKjcl the
will until he died.
He was contradicted in this bv his sis
ter, Mrs. l^iura Stice, who testified that
he was fully conscious until his death.
Dr. lvancovitch recited a lot of ancient
Latin while describing the 3eath wound
of the deceased. The casÂ« was submitted
late this afternoon without comment and
Judge Rodden held the defendant to an
swer before the Superior Court without
bonds.

of the Chinese pickers admitted to thf

that the man was first shot and as he

Is more common than we may think, if
we define gluttony as eating beyond the
bodv's need of sustenance and beyond
the "stomach's capacity for digestion and
assimilation of food. That is a fair
definition, and it fastens the name glut-
ton on many a person who -would resent
the term as an insult. The fact of this
gluttony is marked by its consequences.
The overloaded stomach becomes dis-
eased. The popular term for the condi-
tion is "weak" stomach. The Â«weak r
; stomach fails in furnishing adequate nu-
trition for the body, and soon the "weak-
ness " spreads from the stomach to other
organs.

The Sheriffs of the State, in annual session, have
given us a new genesis of the tramp. - He is an un
ruly boy sent out to hustle for himself. No one will
be more surprised at the definition than perhaps the
tramp.
The young man who used two revolvers in an effort
to blow out his brains must have been deluded by
some phrenologist into an exaggerated notion of his
brain capacity.
A climax of horror seems to have been reached at
Cape Nome. Destitution has become so general that
men can find no profit even by preying upon one
another.
WORTH ONE CENT.
One Man's Character.
San Francisco Call Pays the Price of
Santa Barbara (Cal.) Press.
Some time ago a dapper youth. Charles
"Williams by name, made his appearance
in the San Francisco social world and pro
ceeded to cut a big splurge. This he did
for a time and finally succeeded In becom
ing engaged to a maiden whose father
counted his money by" dollars like other
people count theirs by cents. A few days
previous to the wedding the San Francisco
Call discovered that Williams was not
what he cracked himself up to be, and ac
cordingly published an article showing
him up in his proper light. The wedding
was Indefinitely postponed and young "Wil
liams was promptly ostracized.
"Williams brought suit against The Call
in the Circuit Court before a Jury for
defamation of character. In other words,
he asked the jury to put a price on his
character. Last Monday The Call placed
with the clerk of the Circuit Court a certi
fied check for one cent, in full settlement
of the verdict. Insult was added to Injury
a little later when Williams had to pay
.the costs.
HERE IS ANOTHER SUGGESTION.
Editor The Call: As a foreigner so
journing In your beautiful city may I be
permitted to make a suggestion as to a
fitting Inscription for the handsome Band
S^nd, so liberally given by one of your
most public-spirited citizens, Mr. Claus
Spreckels? 'Â¦ ,
The lines thought of are quoted from
"Cue for Music on Saint Cecilia s Day,
by Pope, and are:
"Hark, the numbers soft and clear
Gently steal upon the ear;
Now louder, and yet louder rise.
And nil with spreading sounds the skies:
Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes.
In broken air. trembling, the wild music floats
Till by degrees, remote and small.
The strains decay.
And melt away
In a dying, dying fall.
"ny music minds an equal temper know,
Nor swell too hlnh. nor sink too low.
If In the breast tumultuous Joys arise.
Music her soft assuasive voice applies;
Or when the soul is pressed with cares
Exalts her in enlivening airs.
Warriors she fires with animated sounds.
Pours balm Into the bleeding lover's wounds;
Melancholy lifts her head,
Morpheus rouses from his bed.
Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes,
Listening Envy drops her snakes;
Intestine war no more our passions wage.
And giddy factions hear away their rase."
Faithfully,
ANDRE IVAXCOVICH.
Over Mr. Hearst's Signature.
The San Francisco Examiner said, over
Mr. Hearst's signature. November 10, 1B96:
"The vote of this election* Is a vote
of approval for the war and tne principle
of expansion.- It is both. right and reason
able that the administration which, de
spite some mistakes, carried this glorious
war to a successful conclusion Bhould re
ceive a vote of confidence. It is both right
and reasonable that the policy of expan
sion, ever. the policy of the American peo
ple since Jefferson annexed the Loulsi
anaa, ehould receive che approval of the
American voters, Republican and Demo
cratic." â Exchange. * .-,....Â¦..-

A FAMOUS VEBDICT.
A reputation estimated by a jury at one
cent, with the privilege of paying the costs
of having tho appraisement made, 19
scarcely a valuable asset In either the
business or social world. Such was the
verdict of the Jury In the damage case of
Charles A. Williams, the South African
mlne y owner, against the San Kranclsco
Call for Its attack upon him two years
ago, made, as The Call said at the time,
"to protect an Innocent girl from the
clutches of a villain and to rid society of
an offensive member." Contrary to thÂ«
usual practice In such cases. Tho Call had
nothing to say about the matter prior to
and during the trial, thus honoring by Us
breach the custom of making' damage
suits serve as an advertisement for thÂ©
paper against which they are brought.
' * VER fince accepting the nomination for the
Presidency Bryi'n has done his best to uphold
â * the declaration of the Kansas City platform
concerning the "paramount issue" of the campaign.
Tie has dodged the money question as nimbly as he
could and has said little or nothing about trusts to
disturb the ice monopoly of New York and the Wclls-
Fargo Express Company. His efforts, however,
have met with indifferent success. In the Eastern
States the people persist in holding him to his free
silver record; in the South, where nearly everybody
is an expansionist, they mock at his paramount
babble, and it now appears that even in the Missis
sippi Valley States the managers of his campaign
have found it necessity to make the fight along some
other line than the one they started on.
A recent report from Chicago announces that
Chairman Jones and his associates of the Democratic
National Committee have put into circulation about
30,000,000 documents on the "paramount" issue, but
have found the people more or less indifferent to
them. The Bryan literary bureau has therefore been
set to work to prepare documents on another issue,
and it has selected the trusts as the object of attack.
The report says: "The Democratic managers imagin
that they are preparing a masked battery. They are
secretly printing millions of pamphlets and leaflets
upon the trust question, which they intend to put into
the mails about September 10, but both the contents
of these documents and their quantity are perfectly
known to the Republican generals, who will have their
own literary artillery trained to meet and silence this
Democratic volley as sure as it is discharged. This
plan to switch from 'imperialism' to trusts is only
another example of the rapidity with which Bryan is
ready to shift from one utterance to another."
It is certainly high time for the Bryanites to make
a change of some kind. Up to this time the only ef
fect of the campaign against so-called "imperialism"
has been to demoralize the silver forces, which con
stitute the main strength of the Bryan movement.
Many of the stanchest silver men of 1896 have refused
to follow Bryan since he undertook to sidetrack the
A VARIEGATED CAMPAIGN.
The prospect of the future is bright. The cam
paign will soon be over. Bryan will be out of poli
tics and politics will bÂ« out of the field of American
activity. Then the fall revival of industry will begin.
Capital will seek investments and homescekers will
be looking for a place to settle. The golden showing
of our banks will then attract the attention of the en
terprising, and the year to come will make an even
better showing of prosperity than that over which we
now rejoice.
One of the significant features of the subject is
that this increase has taken place at a time when there
were many adverse influences operating upon the
rural industries of the State. There had been a scries
cf dry years, which seriously impaired the fertility of
field?, vineyards and orchards, and, moreover, the
farmer had hardly made up for the low prices of farm
products following the depression of the panic of 1893.
That so much of improvement is noted in a single
year, under such circumstances, may be taken as a
conclusive proof of the solid foundation upon which
our prosperity rests.
.Within the State there are 178 commercial banks,
53 savings banks, 37 rational banks and 19 private
banks. The greatest gain in deposits has been in the
savings banks, and that in itself is an encouraging
fact, since it proves that the wage-earners and per
cens of moderate means have shared abundantly in
the prosperity of the time. When the welfare of labor
is assured, that of the whole community follows of it
self. The augmented deposits in the savings banks
mean that the workers of the State have been able to
pay off old debts, live better than before, and Ftill
esve more than ever by way of providing for the fu
ture.
rIGURES compiled from reports made to the
State B^nk Commissioners show that since July
31, 1899, the deposits in California banks have
increased by the sum cf $22,973,693. That showing is
an effective refutation of the calamity arguments of
the Bryanites, but it has a value greater than that.
Political discussions will be over in a month or two,
and then will come a time when people will begin to
talk business again. Then the record of the increase!
savings and deposits of our people will be an en
coaTagernent for new enterprises in all lines of trade
scd industry.

ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE.
ONE of the unexpected results of the worl I's
competition at the Paris Exposition is the an
nouncement that the Jewish colonists in Pales
tine have obtained a gold medal for exhibits of wine
and cf grape brandy, and a silver medal for fruit trees
and fruit.
There has been a good deal of scoffing at* all at
tempts to settle Jewish colonists upon the lands of
the ancient home of their race. The scoffers have as
serted that the soil of Palestine is exhausted and in
capable of making a profitable return for any exten
sive cultivation, and that the Jewish race is not fitted
for agriculture. Assuming their assertions to be true,
they have concluded that a Jewish colony would fail
at farming anywhere, that any colony would fail at
farming in Palestine, and that a Jewish colony farm
ing in Palestine would have to quit after the second
year and start life over again as dealers in rags and
junk.
. The success achieved at Paris by the agriculturist's
in such a high grade of farm work as that of produc
ing wines and fruits is sufficient to prove that the
scoffers are likely to have the laugh turned against
them. Palestine was once one of the richest countries
in the world so far as soil is concerned, and its pro
duction in the way of grapes astonished the Hebrews
even after their long experience on the rich soil of
Egypt- The destruction of forests has largely but not
wholly destroyed the old-time richness of the Pales
tine hills and valleys. There remains a basis upon
which to restore something at least of the old-time
fertility, and upon that the Jewish colonists arc
building. That they arc having an encouraging
amount of success is proven by their exhibits at
Paris, and it is quite probable the future may see a
wealth of production there which will startle many
folks who have believed no good can come out of
Nazareth.

duced From THE EXAMINER With Comments by
Dr. E. A. Bohm.
"I practiced lair until I became so busy prosecuting the Republican
party for grand larceny that I did not have time to defend people
charged with petty larceny."
â¢*^*~ Answerâ This gave you plenty of time to prove and more
so to show your ability. If Colonel Roosevelt ever really ac
cused Democrats of cowardice, do you get even by calling
Republicans grand larcenists?
"I want all the avenues kept open Â«o that every child born into the
world will have something to hose for."
JtJfli Answerâ Democrats have always given hope. Republi
cans have given prosperity and opportunities to every child
born into the part of the world we call the United States.
"This Republican system of private monopoly la condemning the
1 ' young men to perpetual clerkship."
Answerâ Therefore Coxey aimles have been extinct! no
need of crying out for work.
"If the Republican policy continues you will be pounded until you do
T->RStrmiS 'enough.' "
"^ -^ . Answerâ If the Republican policy continues you will be
pounded until you do holler "Enough."
TTT"VPTM1 'â¢The poor men will furnish sons for the army, but thÂ« contractors
-* 1J p^ ly and the exploiters will reap the profits."
f Answerâ Bryan's father furnished a son for the array, a
Ui poor colonel, who contracted that honor to exploit and reap
SUGGBSSi profits for political reasons.
A reputation estimated by a Jury at ona

like Banquo's ghost, they will not down,
and I for one take off my hat to the brave
few who. like Dr. Jordan on the platform
and Hauptmann on the stafce. force us to
think about these questions and to try

Hauptmann's mqst poetical play, "The
Sunken Bell." has gone through twenty
five editions in Germany and has run the
I round of all the principal theaters there.
Its failure when produced last sprinp in
New York by Mr. SothÂ«rn Is not entirely
due to our American refusal to take our
I theater seriously, but is partly attributa
ble to our natural lack of interest In the
folklore of a foreign nation and partly to
defects in the dramatic treatment. Sym
bolism is a dangerous element In a play;
it requires the nicest handling to make it
effective, and when freely employed, as
In "Maeterlinck." is sure to Induce ob
scurity. Now "The Sunken Bell" is full of
xymbollsm. and w.orse than this, a per
sonal symbolism that has no Interest for
those iknorant of the fact that the bell
which sank in the mountain lake is rup
po=ed to typify Hauptraann's historical
drama. "Florian Geyer"â a failure. The
strength of the play lies in the character
ization and in the beautiful lyrical pas
sages in which It abounds. Miss Mueller
pives the ptory at somewhat tedious
length; Mr. Archer, who saw the play at
Frankfort, has a plot statement briefer
and better proportioned. â¢ â¢ â¢ Hem
rich, a famous bell founder, has macla a
great bell for a church which haa been,
built at the top of a mountain. As It la
being drapged up the mountainside a ma
licious satyr upsets the cart, tho bell toUa
down Into the depths of the lake and tha
bell founder either falls or throws him
self after it. Not Into the lake, however;
he falls into the arms of Rautenrieleln.
"an eUln creature." a sort of dryad or

1 end comes when he sees hla two children
toiling up the mountain earrylr.s betweea
them a heavy pitcher:
Heinrichâ "What bear ye in the pitcher,
dear, my children?
Kirst Childâ Salt water.
Second Childâ Bitter water.
First Childâ Mother's tears.
At the same moment the voice Â«f th*
sunken bell booms forth from the depths
of the lake: Heinrich casts oft Rautende

to seek Rauthedelein and die. and th-i

colloquy between them.
What we should like to know, however, is exactly
how "Buggy Robe" S:.m got in with Phelan. If our
correspondent will ascertain this and send us word
Â¦we will promise to make only confidential use of the
information. Mere sycophancy, nor yet a buggy
robe, would never gain the favor of Phelan. That
autocrat demands Knight service, and a description
cf the nature of the yoke with which he has enci-cled
Eraunhart's neck would make an excellent story.
We believe that Colonel Jim O'Brien named the
sycophantic Supervisor "Buggy Robe" Braunhart.
But that has nothing to do with the appropriateness
of the appellation. Colonel O'Brien names every
body. It was he who gave the late Senator Donovan
his title of "Pickle" Donovan and Max Popper the
.designation of "Street Sweeping Max." Our cor
respondent will probably remember that Popper was
fct one time a partner with Buckley in a street sweep
ing contract, and that later he paid Martin Kelly and
Phil Crimrr.ins $600 a month for the privilege of
keeping the same contract under a boodle Board of
Supervisors controlled by them.
Braunhart is a pap-sucking politician. He lives by
cff.ee seeking, nnd the principles he professes are all
besed upon 2. desire to serve the people in some po
sition to which a salary is attached. To him, there
fore, a political boss possessing power to confer pap
it always an object of interest. During Buckley's
reign Braunhart pastured on husks. That boss sized
the little sycophant up at his true value â which is
nothing â and persistently declined either to give him
zn o5ce or to aid him in getting one. In order tc
placate the boss, it is ?a:d, Braunhart presented him
with an expensive whip and buggy robe. Buckley
luid just made a vulgur display of his wealth by pui
chasing a fine equipage, and the gift went home.
Lraunhart was immediately taken into the fold arid
became an obedient lamb.
A CORRESPONDENT at the Potrcro, who
says he desires to keep posted on current events
in politics, writes asking us to explain our rea
tons for referring to Supervisor Braunhart as
â¢'Buggy Robe" Sam. Of course this is history. At
best, however, it is trivial history, and ordinarily we
would answer our correspondent by suggesting that
he address his question to Colonel Jirn O'Brien,
Supervisor Charley Kced. "Street Sweeper" Popper
< r some other person familiar with the reign of Boss
Buckley in this city. But Braunhart's late "reform"
I retensions seem to justify us in making a public
explanation of the origin of the name.
"BUGGY ROBE" SfJM.
Now. if tho object of dramatic art be
onlv to amure, it is evident that there is
no place in it for such a play as this, for
a more horrible subject cut hardly be
imaidned. But if the draira'ist may not
be denied the privilege of teaching granted
to the novelist and the i-ssayist. then such
a theme as that in "Refore Sunrise" 13
a proper subject for dramatic treatment,
rnd tho only question is: Has the dram
atist made his play interesting and has he
correctly solved the moral problem which
he presents? Yes, he has done both. The
interest is inherent in fche nature of the
question, hereditary alcoholism, which for
sill its admitted horribleness is a pressing
problem in that most vital and most mod
ern science. Sociology; the solution is cor
rect, for though the death of Helen is ter
rible, six times more terrible would have
bern her living to give life to half a dozen
children, each infected with the taint of
hereditary alcoholism.
When confronted with the specter of
such a question a.s this Society is apt to
hide Its head, ostriehlike, in the sand of
Hauptmann has two distinct manners â
the naturalistic and the idealistic. The
former is the expression of his fellow
feeling for the poor and the oppressed;
thu latter, of hi3 poetic temperament,
pure and simple. Classified accordingly,
nis best plays fall edslly into two di
visions; in the one come "Uefore Sunrise,"
'.ThO festival of Peace." 'â¢L.onrly Lives."
"The Weavers" and 'â¢Driver Henschel";
in the other "Hanm'le's Ascension to
Heaven" and "The Sunken Hell." Of
"Lonely Lives" and "The Weavers" I
have given some account upon former oc
casions; "Before riunrlse" may therefore
briefly detain us to-day. The plot as
plven by Miss Mueller is as follows: Loth,
a socialist; a man of badges, pledges und
principles, comes to a mining district near
Berlin to study the condition of the
miners. At the house of his former col
lege friend Hofmann he meets his friend's
sister-in-law Helen, a pure and lonely
flower rooted in the foul soil of an In
fested home. She is the youngest daugh
ter of a peasant, who, after suddenly be
coming rich through the opening of a
mine on his land, had, like all his neigh
bors, taken to drinking, and at the open
ing of the drama had degenerated into a
mere beast. The young people fall in love
with each other, and when Loth hears
that Helen's father is a drunkard and
that her sister has inherited this vice he
leaves Helen, sacrificing the splendid
creature for a future hypothetical race of
young Loths. Helen then despairs of life
and kills herself.
It Is one of the crudest facts in this
stupid world that nearly every thinker
who is in advance of his age wastes ten
or fifteen of the best years of his life in
vain attempts to get a hearing. To this
rule Hauptmann is one of the few happy
exceptions. Hla first play, "Vor Sonnen
nufgang" ('â¢Before Sunrise"), written
when he was only 26, was far too uncon
ventional to be accepted at any subven
tior.ed the.-iter; It might, therefore, never
hnvft pot beyond the manuscript stage had
it not happened that just about this time
there was formed in Berlin an associa
tion known as the Freie Buehne (Free
Stage), the object of which was to encour
age originality in dramatic productions.
The Frelc Buehne produced "Before Sun
rise"; it was received with a storm of
mingled applause and -vituperation violent
as that which, sixty years before, had
raged around the devoted head of Victor
Hugo's "Herr.ani."
has to-day only four,' it may be
not unprofitable to follow Mips Mueller a
little distance into the field that she has
opened up for us.
OERHART HAUPTMANN, the Ger
man playwright, is the subject of
an appreciative study in the Sep
tember Atlantic by Margarethe
Mueller. As we have no dramatic
poets of our own, and as Europe
The letters from which these conclusions are
drawn were received from Illinois. Kentucky, Ohio,
Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska. South Dakota, North
Dakota and Montana. They are therefore fairly rep
resentative of the whole of the central portion of the
Union lying between the Rockies and the Alleghany
Mountains. Some of the strongest evidences of pros
perity come from Bryan's own State. Such argu
ments need no speaker to expound them. Prosperity
is an issue which the intelligence of the American
people perceives of itself, and, moreover, that intelli
gence has learned by experience how to value pros
perity when it sees it.
For the purpose of obtaining up to date facts con
cerning the conditions of that section the Republican I
National Committee recently sent out letters to a I
large number of representative business men asking '.
how the financial affairs of their communities com- '
pared with those of five years ago. A summary of
the replies shows that savings and commercial de
posits have increased from 50 to 120 per cent since j
1806; that municipalities are able to borrow money j
at a rate averaging more than one-half of one per
cent less than in 1896; that farm values in most sec- |
tions have almost doubled; that about 50 per cent of |
farm mortgages have been paid up, and the re- 1
mainder renewed only with "prepayment'' privilege? j
and at lower interest rates; and that from 20 to 25 j
per cent of the debtor classes, to whom 'Bryan four I
years ago vainly appealed with his dishonest propos*
tions for cutting in two the value of money leg?lÂ»
tender in payment for debts, are now actually lending
money in competition with the business men writing
these letters.
The prosperity of the time is so notable among
the seaboard States of both the Atlantic and the Pa
cific that there is not the slightest prospect of Rry?n
carrying any of them. His fight is to carry enough of
the States of the Middle West to make up with the
solid South a majority of the Electoral College.
Even in that section of the Union, however, the pre
vailing prosperity is so great it is doubtful if the
calamity candidate will get as large a vote as he did
four years ago.
Four years ago the workingmen and the business
men of this country were almost at the end of their
resources. The long years of industrial and com
mercial depression following the panic of 1893 had
about exhausted the savings of the workers and the
capital of the merchants. Bryan's promise of an easy
way to pay old debts bv reducing the standard of
value of the currency was then a very direful threat
ii'deed. It was not known how far the people suf
fering from a lack of work and wages Â«vould be de
ceived by it, and as a consequence something like .1
paralysis of trade was upon the country for months.
The very day Bryan's defeat was made known the
mills began to resume work. Since then there has
been such an activity in all lines of industry as was
never known before. Our home market has been
profitable to producers of all sorts o? goods, and In
addition thereto there has been found a way to ex
pand our foreign commerce to an extent undreamed
of four years ago. Those facts are fresh in the minds
of the people. There is no desire for a return of
calamity. We have hsd enough of that for the rc.;t
of the life of this generation.
STATESMEN and politicians are talking of the
Philippine question and the money question, but
it is probable that after all the sup. cine issue in
the minds of the people is that presented by the con
trast between the conditions of workingtnen and
business men in 1896 and those which prevail to-day.
General Prosperity isn't much of a talker, but his
silence is of the kind called golden and its influence
felt in every American home is more potent than the
eloquence of all the calamity orators from the Pa
cific to the Atlantic.

San Francisco opens all her dcors to those who
throng her streets to join in the celebration. She
has arrayed herself for the most magnificent festival
of her history, and in the glory of banners and the
ftarry splendor of innumerable lights displays the
jubilation she feels Â«ri receiving all California within
her gates. It is a time for exultation, for music and
for cheers, and everywhere in the city, from the ferry
to the cliff that overlooks the ocean, the joyous visit
ors will find occasion and opportunity to give voice
to the gladness, of their hearts in celebrating Califor
nia's jubilee.
To-day we can with gratification challenge the
world to show a land where industry is more amply
rewarded, where labor has better wages, where thrift
has more varied opportunities to prosper, where all
classes are more closely affiliated, where homes are
fairer or the home life sweeter than in California.
Humanity has attained here its highest level of civili
zation. The fruitful scil is not more prolific of fruits
and flowers than is society of brave men and fair
women. Among no ether people is there such hos
pitality of welcome to all or such geniality of social
intercourse. It is the land of lands in beauty and in
wealth â and the best land of all to work in, to play
in and to live in.
Out of this awakened spirit of State loyalty and
pride there will *omc an intelligence which will recog
nize and appreciate at their true value the larger in
terests of California. Such great issues as those of
irrigation, the preservation of forests, the conserva
tion of streams, the improvement of rivers, the de
velopment of better systems of municipal government;
and the advancement of manufacturing and commer
cial industries will occupy much of the thought and
engage much of the energy which in the past have
been given almost "wholly to local issues. California
patriotism will come to mean something more than a
willingness to celebrate Admission day. It will sig
r.ify a readiness among the people to work together
for the common good ?nd for the greater glory of tht
State and the Union.
It is right and proper that the achievements of Cali
fornia in the first fifty years of her statehood should
be celebrated with an ardor universal among her peo
ple. Her pioneers, her native sons and daughters,
and her children by adoption, have reason to rejoice
in her prosperity and her greatness. There is no
vanity in such jubilation as this, for it is not founded
upon emptiness or a mere conceit of superiority. It
is an outcome of a recognition of the thousand advan
tages which Californians enjoy over those whose
homes are fixed in other lands, and a consciousness
of the prevalence throughout the State of a feeling ot
patriotism among the people which assures a future
even more brilliant th.in the past.
The pioneers who laid broad and deep the foun
dations of the civilization of the State were worthy of
the mighty task committed to their hands. By the
arduous proof of things done they have attested their
right to the honor which Californians of all genera
tions, present and to conic, will give them, in tradi
tion, song and history. They knew how to employ
in the service of humanity every rich resource of cli
mate a:id of soil, an.i already the State is renowned
not more ior the gold that veins the mountains than
for the luxuries of wine, fruit and oil that blossom
?.nd ripen in vineyards and orchards. Hampered by
adverse conditions of traffic and transportation, these
same pioneers have provided the beginnings of a
varied industry along all lines of arts and crafts from
music to iron molding, and from the studios of art
ists and the shipyards of the artisans have come forth
masterpieces of beauty and of strength, that rightly
rank among the best that the marvelous century has
produced.
Were the full importance of the admission of Cali
fornia as a free State duly known to all Americans
the celebration would be national. The East would
rejoice as cordially as the West. It would be a day
which ill the estimation of patriots would rank second
only to the glorious Fourth of July, for it was a day
which assured to the nation and to freedom a State
of commanding importance, fronting on the greatest
of oceans and possessing the richest and most varied
resources of any equal area of land on the face of the*
globe. It opened to the East of the Atlantic coast
a golden gate to the older East of China and India.
It made the republic truly continental, and gave to
patriots a field of activity broad enough for the reali
zation of their highest aspirations and most splendid
dreams.
CALIFORNIA awakes this morning to the fif
tieth anniversary of her admission to the
' political rights of a State in the American
Union. The celebration of the event virtually began
yesterday, and is to continue to-morrow and the day
after to-morrow. It is to be a four-day festivalâ the
greatest in our annals and one of the most notable in
American history.

to offset the loss. It is therefore not unlikely there
Will be a complete adoption of the plan proposed by
David Bennett II ill â that of making the fight on dif
ferent issues in different parts of the country. Democ

it will be said the money question is not at issue; in
the West it will be said free silver is the chief issue;
in the Mississippi Valley the clamor will be for the
suppression of trusts, and in the South the cry will
be "anything to beat McKinlcy."

NOTES OF THE
NATIONAL GUARD
TEAMSTER AND
TAILOR LODGED
IN THE TANKS
They Combined to Steal
Cloth From the South
ern Pacific
William Dan Thompson Will Be
Charged With Grand Larceny and
L. Parente With Receiving
Stolen Property.
Thompson lived at 2314B Mason street,
and on going there the officers recovered
two bolts of the stolen cloth and two suits
which had been made out of them.
Thompson's mother told them that her son
earned but $2 50 weekly.
The loss of the bales was discovered and
C. C Crowley, chief special detective of
the Southern Pacific, detailed two of his
assistants, Peter Lewin and Patrick Kin
dele n, on the case. The police were also
notified, and Detective T. L.. Ryan was
detailed by Captain Seymour to assist in
tracing the thief or thieves. Thompson
was arrested yesterday morning, and at
first denied that he knew anything of the
missing bales, but finally confessed. The
detectives went to Parente's shop and re
covered most of the stolen property in a
back room. He was very indignant wnen
he learned the object of the visit of the
oiiicers and denied knowing anything
about Thompson or the bales. After the
discovery of the goods he begged the of
ficers to allow him to entertain his guests,
but he was escorted to the City Prison.
Thompson's mode of procedure was to
take a bale to the freight yards, deliver
it and obtain the receipt from the clerk.
'1 hen he would watcn his opportunity, and
when no one observed him he would re
load the bale on his wagon and drive off
with it to Parente's shop. The dates on
which he did this was on August 1, Au
gust 20. August a; August 22, August 23
and September 5.
His accomplice, who will be charged
with grand larceny. la William Dan
Thompson, a teamster 21 years of age.
'1 liompson was employed by Fry's exprtss
and had a stand on Ellis street, lie was
employed to haul goods to the Southern
Pacilic freight yaras for P. H. Gallagher
& Co. and f. Greenburg &. Co.. wholesale
woolen merchants. Since August 1, it is
alleged, he has stolen six bales of goods
valued at about JSOO which he soid to
Parente. He had received altogether from
Parente. it is claimed, about $40 for the
six bales.
L. Parente. a tailor at 408 Francisco
street, sent out Invitations for a dance
at his rooms last night and ordered a
lavish spread of eatables and drinkables
fur his guests, but instead of playing the
host he occupied a cell in the tanks at the
City Prison. lie will be booked on a
chaise of receiving stolen property.

Chunks of the World May Be Eaten

When one reads o^nears of some sud
den and violent alteration in the crust of
this planet of ours one instinctively puts
it down to something in the way of a vol
canJc outburst. In most cases it Is so.
But not always. Mother Earth has many
fashions of building up what she likes and
getting rid of what she is tired of.
One hardly wonders that Indian tribes
who frequented the shores of the Colum
bia River used to worship as the 'â¢Ail-de
vouring One" a great cliff near the Cas
cades; which for many years past has been
steadily advancing upon the river, with
the evident Intention of blotting out Its
bed and forming a huge lake above. This
will inevitably happen. The mountain,
which ia 2000 feet high and eight miles
long, has been proved to be moving for
ward and downward at a rate of one to
three feet a year. The railwav track
which runs along Its base has to 'be con
stantly altered. The reason of this pon
derous landslide is that the mountain
rests on a layer of soft sandstone, which
is steadily giving way.
The village of Sainte Foy de Tarentaise
in Eastern France seems doomed to be
engulfed. The base of the hill on which
it stands In being eaten away by the
rapid waters of the Isere. The houses,
some of them, show cracks rivaling those
of our Cheshire Northwich. Some day
there will be n. "short, sharp shock" and
Tarentaise will no longer exist.
Islands go and come so constantly that
none but the admiralty keep count of
them. Submarine volcanoes are responsi
ble for most of these disappearances, but
others are harder to account for. Metis
Island, for Instance, in the South Pacific,
bore no sign of volcanic action about it.
It was charted in 1SS0. its highest point
being. 150 feet. Last year it had gone
vanished utterly without leaving a trace.
On the site of another small guano island
off the coast of Southern California re
cent soundings showed 50 fathoms of
water. Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay
was fortified by our fleet in the war of
1S12. It has sunk steadily, till now those
fortifications are under water.
The shifting sands of the great desert
are as hungry as the pitiless sea Itself.
Many of the smaller oases in the Sahara
have disappeared from sight In an hour
or two. buried deep by the deadly simoom.
Some 400 miles southeast of the old city
of Kashgar. far out in the yellow desola
tion of the desert of Gobi, the great Swed
ish explorer Sven Hedln saw something
projecting from the smooth side of one
of the long dunes. It was the wooden roof
ol> a house. Further investigation showed
that it was but one of thousands. A teem
ing city of highly civilized Aryans had
Jong existed on this spot until the earth
had tired of it and wiped it out.
Until December 18. 1S11. the eastern part
of Cralghead County. Ark., was one of
tho most beautiful and fertile stretches
of prairie imaginable. Interspersed with
tracts of lovely woodland. Pretty rivers
ran between high, clay banks, and the
country was ranidly settling. On the
morning of December 13. In place of riv
ers and rolling prairie, a great lake rippled
in the sunllcht. In the night the whole,
region. 120 miles long and sixty wide, had
sunk twenty to forty feet. To-day the
weird lakes of the Arkansas sunk lands
offer the most beautiful scenery and some
of the best sport in all the Southern
States.

â¢NEW YORK, Sept. 8.-The last day of
the Coney Island Jockey Club's fall meet
ing at Sheepshead Bay attracted a big
half-holiday crowd. An interesting card
was offered for decision, with the annual
Champion stakes of J25.000 and the Great
Eastern handicap of $7500 the features.
Both furnished stirring struggles and
more than the usual amount of excite
ment.
David Garrick, at the liberal price of
20 to 1. won the annual Champion, beating
the odrls-on favorite, Kthelbert, a neck in
a hard drive, while Duoro was third, only
a neck away. The time, 3:56, was fast,
and constitutes a new track 'record, the
old mark of 3:5S having stood since 1S32,
made by Hindoo, with 100 pounds up.
Unfortunately the result of the race left
an unsavory feeling, as Spencer's ride on
Ethelbert was so bad that it looked almost
criiriinal. He appeared to be in a trance
and only woke up when too late to win
with the favorite. It is hard to detract
from the credit due David Garrick and
Bullman, but good judges all agree that
the best horse did not win. Jack Joynor
trains both David Garrick and Ethelbert,
and there was much unfavorable comment
after the race. Track fast; weather
clear. Results:
Five furlongs, selling â Tolomon won, Mauga
second. Salvo third. Time, 1:00.
Seven furlongsâ Modrine won, Lady Uncas
Fetond, Belle of Lexington third. Time. 1:26 3-5.

TimÂ«\ 1:12 4-5.
The Annual Champion, two and a quarter
milesâ David Garrlck won, Ethelbert second.
Duoro third. Time, 3:56.
Steeplechase, about two and a half miles â
Plato and Old Tank ran a dead heat. Captain
Piersal third. Time. 5:22 1-5.
Mile and a sixteenth, sellingâ Maximo Gomez
won, Compensation second, Alslke third. Time,
1:47.
CHICAGO. Sept. 8.â Mint Sauce cap
tured the rich Harlem stakes, the feature
of Harlem's card this afternoon, and for
nine furlongs broke the track record of
1:53*4 by going ' the route In 1:52 1-5. and
won eased up to a common canter. Flori
zar was the ruling: favorite at 9 to 5 and
heavily played. Mint Sauce went to the
front immediately, and although Found
was about the speediest sprinter in the
race, she could never reach the pace
maker. All were very tired trying to
keep up and PinochJe was gamest at the
end, coming strong and beating out Found
by a head. Florizar could never get up
and was" In fourth place at the finish.
Hattle June, a 200 to 1 shot, in the second
race acted so badly at the post that the
start was delayed twenty-three minutes.
The filly refused to budge after parading
past the grand stand and Jockey Moody
was forced to lead his mount to the start
ing point. At every false break she would
run a furlong and then had to be led
back. After the long delay they were
finally sent away and it resulted in strict
ly a two-horse race between Jim Inez and
Duelist, first and second choices. Although
Jlmlnez is a high-class colt, it took all he
had to. win by half a length. Weather
clear; track fast. Summaries:
Seven furlongsâ Jim W won, Jake "Weber sec*

King Cotton Fails to Show
the Superiority That
Was Expected.
Long Odds Favorites Are Put to Se
vere Tests â Floodgate, Harleaa
Gladys and Lovina Bon
in Good Form.
Curtl3 & Son's much-touted Btais faror
ite. King Cotton, came within an ace of
losing his chances for even a small bit. o{
the bis Futurity event at Union Park yes
terday in his Ions course with Headwater,
and to those who backed him In the long 1 
odd3 book his scant victory was. to say
the least, a disappointment. Long ar: r >
the hound was quoted at 5 to 1 and \
steady play was made on him. thoush f.fe
odds remained about the, same. If harJ
luck stories were la order It was certainly
up to Headwater's owner to tell a tale of
woe. When the work commenced Kins
Cotton showed a decided Inclination to
keep off the game, and though thl3 ordi
narily would have cost him the course,
the luck was on his side, as the hare fa
vored him several times against Captain
Clarkson's Golden Garter. Cotton haa r.o
cinch In tho second round. Gart^r'a
course lasted but twenty- five seconds.
Floodgate showed more speed than any
of the candidates and Â¦won as ho pleaded ,
in a short run.
Short ends were not numerous and bui
half a dozen upsets were recorded. Van
dal, a 5 to 1 stake favorite, went out to
Early Dawn, who sold 3 to 1 for th!9
course. Harlean Gladys and Lovina both
had short runs and are In position to get
well down on the card. Outside of First
Foot the Russell. Allen & Wilson Kennel
is not strong: on probable winners. That
dog did some clean work and figures to
meet Floodgate near the finish.
Quite a number of hounds of which
much wag expected went against stror.sj
hares and were given severe work, which
will handicap their chances to-day and
in some cases necessitate their with
drawal. This makes the finals a guessing
match and it is not unlikely that some
Ions shot will slip In and surprlsa tha
wise ones.
The hares were able to give the young
sters sufficient exercise, and if as atrons
a lot is furnished for the finals the spec
tators will witness some great goes.

CLOSE GAME OF
BASEBALL GOES
TO THE DUDES
Harness and Running Races Are All
Interesting and But Three
Favorites Come First
Under tne Wire.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 8.â There was all
sorts of sport for the edification of visit
ors to Agricultural Park to-day and
thousands enjoyed a splendid day's out
ing. The day was warm and in the fore
noon the crack society polo players drew
a full house.
After the noon hour two harness and
four running- races came up for decision,
the favorites meeting: with varying for
tunes, but three carrying off purses. Th3
Vinctor stake, worth $7-19, at a mile, over
shadowed the other features, even if some
fierce betting was indulged in on the 2:19
trot. There were oniv live starters and
at the weights the crowd could see noth
ing but Willie Sink's I-'ormero, carrying
Ruiz and 117 pounds. The bookmakers
passed out gross after gross of paste
boards with the chestnut's name on thfin
at even money and he lagtimed in a length
ahead of Herculean and Toribio in 1:41.
There was a tedious delay at the post
caused by the unruly antics of Jennie
Reid, Starter Reagan finally getting
them off to an excellent break. Constel
lator made all the runring to the stretch,
where he cracked, and the favorite waded
past his company.
Those who imagined polo a dude's game
played with .111 English walking-stick and
a strap on the wrist have now arrived at
a different conclusion after seeing the
rough work of the balloon-trousered ath
letes on their diminutive steeds. The field
was rough, precluding pretty plays, not
withstanding which a very exciting game
was played. Half of Sacramento will tutn
out 10 witness the next one. The teams
were composed of Walter Hobart, Dick
Tobln, M. E. Flowers and Peter Martin
of the Blues and Tom Driscoll. Charley
Dunphy, Frank Carolan and J. T. Tobin
of the Reds. After four periods of ten
minutes' duration the scor*Â» stood 4 to i
in favor of the Blues r.nd the tired play
ers welcomed the timer's whistle. Wal
ter Hobart played with his usual clash
and brilliancy, maklnpr two of the goals
for his side. Tom Dri&coll's telling left
handed swipes caught the crowd, whilp
Dick Tobin's clever work bordered on the
sensational. Toward the end Frank Car
olan warmed up. knor-kir.K the only goal
to the credit of the Iteds. Young Joe
Tohln. always a leading factor in the
scrimmages, scored on<: for the Reds,
which was protested and disallowed be
cause the player was not on the off side
It was a llnely drawn decision.
At 1 o'clock the 2:15 class pacers were
called, seven scoring by the judges. Queen
R. the fast daughter of Redondo. driven
by P. \V. Hodges, defeated her field in
three 6traight heats without being ex
tended, the best mile paced being In 2:12^4.
Dick Havey landed second money with
Hermla. In the opening heat Tags fin
ished third, but through some oversight
Hermia was placed in that position, caus
ing a mild kick from the bookmakers.
Sam Hoy and his horse McNally placed
a well-developed crimp in the talent over
the result of the 2:19 trot. IWort the race
it was noised about as a little ham and
eggs for Dora Doe, which sold for $20,
the field $9 and Richmond Chief $6. Dora
took the first heat rather handily in 2:15
from Prince Ansel and then blew a fuse,
for a yard of chain could not get her to
the wire first again. Still sh*Â» had friends,
the pools celling Dora Doe 521, Richmond
Chief $20 and the field $20. In the second
heat Dora led to the stretch and was
then clearly outfooted by McNally, losing
by a length, once more 2:15 being hung
cut. ThÂ« field now brought $20, Dora Doe
$9 and Richmond Chief $13. Ed Lafftrty.
behind Chief, made a. great bid for the
third heat, but broke sixty yards from the
tape and was beaten a head in a furious
drive. Chief was placed third for his mis
take and Charlie Me given second posi
tion. Three to two was obtainable in the
books against McNally before the fourth
and deciding heat, and he stepped to tow
with all pails reefed an easy winner.
When the Vinctor stake had been de
cided a cheap dash for two-year-olds fol
lowed. Screenwejl I,ake. the favorite,
acted badly at the post, running: unplaced.
Canmore. piloted by Tom Butler, spread
eagled his field, winning eased up from
Location and Eltopic.
A six-furlonp: pprlnt saw the unexpected
downfall of the 4 to 5 choice Mocorito.
Leading into the stretch, the mare quit,
ending up in the show. Stuart rode a
perfect race on Pomplno, the second
choice, disposing of Merry Boy without
nn effort at the elope. Jingle Jingle,
weakly ridden, should be due next time.
Amasa made a show of the bunch in the
closing: event, winning all tli^ way. Phle
pran wac beaten for the place by Pilot.

Special Dispatch to Tht Call.
KErvr YORK, Sept. 8.-^Tames J. Corbett
sailed for Europe to-day on the Cunard
Line steamship Campania, His departure
was surrounded with the utmost Becrecy
and was unknown to some of his moat
intimate friends. "When the former fistic
champion was well past Sandy Hook his
wife announced that they had separated
and that she would sue the pugilist for
divorce. A report that attended hl3 going
was that he had sold out his business in
terests here and might not soon return.
With Corbett went George Considlne,
his manager. Their names did not appear
on the passenger list It was believed
that they had taken passage under other
names. John R. Considine. Corbett's
partner in his saloon, confirmed the report
of their sailing.
Mrs. Corbett was seen at her apart
ments. She said she knew her husband
Intended to sail for Europe to-day. "Mr
Corbett and I," she said, "have not been
living together for about six months. We
separated by mutual consent, and if he
has gone away to stay I shall consider
myself well rid of him.
"I will sue Mr. Corbett for divorce. Ift
fact, I have already begun an action on
the ground of extreme cruelty. I cannot
begin to tell you the cruelties that he has
practiced upon me. Once he held the
glowing end of a cigar against my cheek
while it burned the flesh deeply and I
screamed Jji agony."
Mrs. Corbett said she had made a set
tlement with her husband and that she
was well provided for.
"I know that his fight with McCoy was
a fake," she continued. "My husband
jiirrecd ostensibly to throw the flg-ht to
McCoy. This was done so that McCoy
would not train. When McCoy went to
the garden and my husband told him that
he was sroinjr to fiijht and vAn he had no
trouble in doing so, as McCoy, relying on
the agreement, did not get into condition."
He Sails for Europe With His Part
ner, George Considine, and
.! May Not Return
Soon.

Good stories come from the mining

une Is Indebted for a new one to a trav
eler who had stopped over at Carson City,
New, to look after his own claims.
"A 'strike' was recently made near Car
son." he said, "and it turned out to be
one of such promise that a good-sized
camp soon sprang up around It. The two
principal mine owners were respectively
an Irishman and a Jew, and aÂ» a delicate
compliment to thesf> leading citizens the
re.Â«t of the miners left it to them to be
slow a name upon the new camp.
"The two had many conferences, but
could not reach an agreement, for the
Irishman Ftood out for a name taken from
the Emerald Isle, while the Jew was for
one that would be suggestive of the
chosen people. The rest of the miners
finally became restless and threatened to
name the camp themselves If an end was
not put to the delay, and this led the pair
to compromise.
"They named the new camp 'Tlpperusa-

NAT1ONAL DRESSâ The American
women of to-day do not have a distinctive
national dress, such as Is characteristic
of the women of Sweden. Norway, the
Swiss Alps, Brittany and other Kuropean

the treaty of peace between the United

WHOLESALE DISCARDING OF WIVES
Â«=jpSHE Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Indians, who live on
jj their reservation south of Wichita, Kana.. says the St.
]l Louis Republic, have just passed through a trying ordeal.
Ry decree of the United States Government the men
are forced to give up all but one wife each. There have been
pome pathetic scenes enacted In connection with the enforcing
of this law. Two of the discarded wives of Xarjo. an Apache
chief, committed euiclde. Six squaws belonging to Tall Elk,
a Comznche warrior, killed themselves . because they had to
leave their lord's tepee.
The legal separation commenced at Darlington. * Indian
Apent Mischener and Captain Tulllngton of the regular army
had lppued a call to all the redskins to meet them In Darling
ton. When the lim faint streaks of dawn were showing in the
sky the braves and their wives began to arrive. The men
drove In buggies with their wives beside them. Perhaps the
squaws were better treated that day than they ever had beeni
before, the men devoting themselves to them and showing them
many little marks of affection. The life of an Indian wife is a
poor and hard existence at best. It is the women In the tepee
who perform all the work and earn the living.
Karjo had ten wives and was arranging with the parents
of two young women to bring them into his harem.
Each man was allowed to keep the wife of his choice, and
In every case this was the oldest, ugliest and fattest of the lot.
Perhaps this showed faithfulness on the part of the man to
stick to the woman whose chances for marrying & second time
would be the slimmest.' At any rate, the youngest and -hand
somest of the squaws were discarded.
-Agent Mischener conducted tho examination. In each case
he asked the bucks if they thought' they were pleasing" the
Great Spirit by believing In polygamy, and every one answered
that he did. ,
The discarded squaws were sent away to the agency build
ing. The Government is preparing to take care of the women
until their reservation la thrown open to settlement, which will
be in the coming winter. Then they will have money enough
to keep themselves.
Since the news of the desertion of the 600 squaws' has been
circulated many white men have Invaded the reservation and
carried off dusky brides.
Jn Oklahoma and the Indian Territory there are still many
Â» relics of barbarism to whichthe Indians cling. One of these
Is the selling of maidens as bridea to the highest bidder. -As
many of the squaws have a headrfght of $5000 or more, many
white adventurers, attracted merely by the pecuniary gain
bargain for these women. Mercenary white men are strivine
to control the lands that the Indians have been given uos
sessfon of. â¢ '
The consideration for a bride is ponies, valued at about $10
each. Sometimes the father is paid part of the purchase nrice
and the balance is worked out. But the Osatea will not let a
bride go on a "stand off." The weddings of tnls tribe are eav
affairs. A number of bucks race for the bride's pony Ind
rnaiden squaws compete In the same way for her robe Durinir
the festivities the bride, elaborately gowned in a white robe
of buckskin, covered with silk and adorned with' many orna
ments, including costly diamonds, emerges from her wigwam
During the race for her pony the bride's mother divests her of
her beautiful wedding garments, .leaving -her clad only In a
night robe. Then the bridegroom runs from his wigwam
throws his blanket around her and carries her off to his happy
home. No word Is spoken throughout the ceremony. After
the wedding the guests assemble in another, part of the town
, and feast on boiled dog, fried dog, canned dog and doc soup.

If an owner desires to have a basement six
l ee ., ... Kh> ln connection with a three-story
bulldins to contain flats, he will be compelled
to carry out the conditions of the law. which
requires him to have the walls, footings, etc.,
the eame as if it was a four-story building.
He can only override the law by havlne half
the heTsht of the basement under ground. If
an owner leaves six feet of clear space above
the Krounil for basement purposes the powers
that be clearly say that they will consider that
a story, and framing- and construction gen
erally must correspond to the law. If on the
same lot the owner digs down three feet in the
cold, cold sround, well, then it will only be a
basement. So in order to have basements here
after half of the contemplated height must be
under pround. If you go above the ground six
feet your walls must be four inches thicker,
your studding must be heavier and generally
the cost jrreatly increased.

I have been In Antelope Valley a few days
fishing, and naturally I have been greatly in
tersÂ£tc4 in the new mineral developments of
this district, and I will tell your readers some
thing that has never failed yet to interest and
excite envy. There Is no occasion for going: to
Cape Nome or the Klondike. I was never more
surprised in my life to hear of the new and
rich locations in this part of%Mono County, and
placed little credence In the reports. But see-
Ing is believing, and I must say that I have
<op n enoueh to convince the most skeptical as
to the preat value of the ore deposits here. Mr.
Carter has a vein near Little Antelope that
takes the cake. It is 20 feet wide and Kives
a. return by free milling tests of J&0 01 per ton.
Iteub Terry haÂ« a very fine prospect near the
old Boardman sawmill, in the eame locality,
that is rich in both gold and silver. In an
easterly direction and about five miles from
theÂ«e localities Mrs. Haslam of Carters has a
location. The Queen Bee. on a vein <0 feet
wide It prospects exceedingly rich In coarse
gold The lady is camping on the river near
John Trumble 1 * place, where we prospected
eonvs of the rock which I brought from the
mine myself. I think, taking It straight across
the vein and not sorting In any way, that It
will ylÂ»ld at mill from JÂ«0 to $43 per ton. On or
near the southern boundary of this location
the parties have discovered a vein about eight
feet wide running parallel with the Queen Bee
that p-ospect* well in free gold. John Trum
ble has the northern extension of the Queen
I5ee and free gold is found the entire length of
the location.
on the chores of Owens Lake and hearing of Its
cleansing j>ropertles. predicted that at eome
time th^ clay on the shores of the lake Â¦would
be more valuable than the soda that is being
so extensively produced from the lake waters
by evaporation and crystallization. In order
to bring- his theory to a test he sent specimens
cf the c!ay to various ixjints to have It. an
alyzed and to find out if there was any min
eral of marketable value therein, and also: to
interest men of capital in the property should
it prove of commercial value. For a long time
his efforts mei with no success, but at last a.
friend of his sent a sample of the clay to Wil
liam S. Bell, a capitalist and one of the prin
cipal owners of the quicksilver mines of Lake
County, and who is also a practical chemist.
He made an anaiysis and Immediately became
interested in the project, as the clay contains
presumably enough aluminum, to make it one
of the greatest properties in the State, if it
can be successfully worked on a large scale.
A few days ago the Judpe received notice to
meet Messrs. Smith and Bell at Keeler. where
they would look over the situation. Mr. Davld
fon showed them the extent of the country
from which the mudyrould be taken. They
were much pleased with the outlook and located
16,000 acres in placer locations. They also have
an option on the lake front from Olancha nin
iJnff north to Cottonwood.

as the. lady whoss hospitality he enjoyed.
"I've nothing: to say now," said Demek.
"When.it comes â¢ to court, I will be on
hand to speak."
â¢ Goz was found . at the ladles' tailoring
establishment where he works, and tola,
as his wife had, the story of their mutual
agreement to separate. Goz was quite as
cold and Indifferent as his* wife. Only
once did his voice break and that was
when he mentioned his little two-year-old
son, and told how he had heard that lit
tle Louis "was asking why "papa" did not
come Â¦ home.
"It is true," said Goz, "my wife told me
she loved Demek and that he loved her.
'You can't love two men at once,' I said,
and so I went away and Jeft her to
Demek. I would not force myself upon
her.
When we were first married," went on
Goz, "I had a.somewhat similar experi
ence. "We were just married one week
when she told me of a man who was call
ing upon her and who told her that he had
money and asked her to fly with him.
Then I persuaded her to stay with me.
This time I let matters go as they would.
I am employed all day and I have been
told^that for more than three months
Demek has been a continual visitor at my
home during my absence. That Is why
I am doing nothing to keep my wife with
me "
The only one who seems to be suffering
at all by this change-around experience is
Mrs. Demek. Driven from her home on
Wildey avenue by the husband who found
a younKer and a comlier woman to love,
she has taken her little 7-year-old boy to
a rooming-house on Xinth street and is
trying to provide for herself and him by
working in a fruit cannery.
- "I am earning about $120 a day," she
said. "I work from 6 In the- morning till
6 at "night. When my husband told mo
thatOie was going, to desert me for Mrs.
Goz I begged, him on my knees to stay
wlth-me. He'said "I can't; I must go to
Mrs. Goz.'. Then I told him he need never
expeÂ£t;to come back to me. He did not
care. He'.went.' <The night'I went up to
the Goz home/ I. don't know why' I 'went,
but when I saw my husband there with
that woman, I could not restrain myself
and I smashed the violin on his head."
All the parties Interested in the suits
are Hungarians, and with the exception
of Demek they find it difficult to tell in
English the romantic tale on which they
base their claims for divorces.
In corroboration.of her statement Mrs.
Goz. summoned Derricks Tfae "barkeep "
however, was not. so glib with his facts
"My husband .was cold," she said. "He
chilled me. I cannot live withoutlove so
whenDemek toldmerthat-.he'loved me I
went to my husband and said : .'You do
not love me. Demek does. I love him
also. You had better go and leave me
with him. 'Very well,' said my husband
He f went away and Demekicame at once
to live here with me." *"
Mrs. Goz discussed her unusual position
in -the most matter of fact manner yes
terday. She spoke of her love for Demek,
to whom she referred proudly as "a musi
cian and a barkeeper"; said she loved him
and he her. and that without love she
could not live. Yet she told this burning
tale in a very matter of fact manner, her
cold face never.- once showing the sllght
es trace of the passion she claimed to so
keenly feel.- - . .. :Â¦.
Tuesday evening Mrs. Demek went to
the. Goz flat and, entering unannounced,
she found the tailor's wife and her faith
less husband seated at the dinner table.
Mrs. Goz was singing and Mrs. Demek's
recreant spouse was accompanying her
on the violin. The sight of this domestic
bliss was .too much for the deserted wife.
She snatched the violin from her hus
band's- hands' and smashed it on i his
head. Then, having put a stop to the
music, she returned to her room on. Ninth
street. Â¦ - 'Â¦ â¢ â¢

Mr. Goz, Mrs. Goz and Mr. Demek met In

"Very well," said Goz to his spouse,

The oil excitement has extended from

California oil stocks to be sold in
the new exchange. There have been
fraudulent # performances In
with certain alleged California cor
porations in the East that have
tended to cast discredit upon the legiti
mate oil-producing companies. Joseph L
Ball, who represents the Chicago Oil and
Mining Exchange as secretary, says that
it is the Intention of L.s associates to deal
in only reliable companies. Chicago will
be willing to supply capital to assist In
the development of the California oil
fields when the facts are well known
there. He is, also of opinion that the Chi
cago'exchange will be able to prevent the
marketing 1 in .the East of worthless oil
stocks. â¢ . ...
"We shall require companies that we
list," he says, "to 'send reports of field
progress and we will exchange quotations
with the California oil exchanges. In this
way we will be able to keep the public
properly Informed."
Louis Blankenhorn describes what he
has seen In the Kern River Held as being
something to astonish any one. From
many commanding points one may see a
tract now six miles long and about . two
miles wide on which within one year'there
have been'drilled one hundrea wells. "All
but a few of these are producing. Many
wells have also been drilled outside of the
defined territory. The supply Is hampered
only by the facilities for transportation. In
the past month mule teams have given
place to oilcars and railway accommoda
tions. There is still a lack of tankage.
The clearing-house of the Los Angeles
Oil Exchange Is about ready to operate.
The board of governors of the exchange
has decided that there will be no puts and
calls on the floor of the exchange here
after, the members of the board being of
opinion that they hurt cash business.
A tract of 800 acres in the Sunset district
has been brought under the control of

nor will there be articles of incorporation
to file.
There is a wellln the McKittrlck district
that Is reported to be spouting at the rate
of 500 barrels of oil per day and shooting
up the greasy fluid to the height of forty
feet. The whole tract has been deluged
and every crack and crevice is filled with
oil. .
The reassuring words of C. A. "Watson of
the Standard Oil Company to the produc
ers of the Kern River district to the effect
that his company is in the field only to
handle the output has not prevented the
formation of the Producers' Oil Storage
Company, which has for its aim the han
dling and marketing of the oil produced
in -the district. Considerable discussion
preceded, this action and conflicting opin
ions were expressed concerning the benefits
and possible damages to come from the
entrance into the field of the Standard Oil
Company. The plan of organization
adopted by producers of oil is about as
was foreshadowed In this paper.
j On the first day , of. August there were
2S0 rigs and drilling wells reported In the
oil fields of California. Thirty days later
there were 439. Attention is called to the
fact that no district has yet been fruitless
ly exploited. Capital is going into the
enterprise with augmenting speed and
some of. -the foremost moneyed men of
the State are largely interested. Three
large enterprises have" been financed In
Southenr California within a very few
weeks, these including the Bard property
In Ventura- County, Â«. the Plru and the
Ollnda ranches, -all of -which have called
for the expenditure of . large sums or

August was a record month for the Los

on the floor of the Exchange 344,087 share3

there were sold 150.450 shares for J89S1 25.

Ttoe Chamber of Mines reports that the
regulations of the Ontario Government
d<> not call for monthly reports and that
thi? chamber has found it difficult to ob
tain information under affidavit, but that
this -will be soon overcome as the advant
ages ni-c recognized. One statement from
the report is as follows: "We would beg
to s.iv that the members of our chamber
have no e,-lnt=h purpose to serve, nor any
monetary interests whatver in the insti
tution, beyond a desire to forward the
pi nrral welfare of the country and more
particularly to encouraue the develop
ment of the valuable gold fields now lying
comparatively dormant in Central Can
cda."
Theodore Win Wagenen has written
en article for th* Mining and Scientific
Prep? in which occurs the following:
"Americans are accustomed to date the
history of mining in the Western United
States from the days of 49. but. nearly
half a century before, copper mining at
Fanta Rita. Xew Mexico, was a. flourish
ing business: while thirty years back of
that date < about 1770) there was a pro
ducing gold mining camp on the Cali
fornia hanks of the Colorado River, about
one hundred miles above its mouthâ that
is. productive from a Mexican point of
view." The region is now known as the
â¢'Pot Holes." A dredger is now being
built at Yuma that will explore the
mouths of the Pot Hole ravines.
Some of the statements embodied In
statistics are as follows: The deepest
shaft ox pit in the districts enumerated is
420 leet; the lowest result furnished by
er.y assay was $4 64 per ton; there are re
yoris of assays ranging to ?1 H J66 per ton.
Several assay renorts read as follows per
ton: S2161 70. J207& Zi and JGfcS 40. The rich
â¬f=t assays are of ore from the Manitou
Lake and R&bipoon districts. The results
from mill orushir.gs run from $8 OS per ton
value of gold ore to $24 3&, Â¦which latter
i'.izxirff mark the top.
The publication of these reports Is quite
ftn expensive matter, as there are pages
of figures that account for the mines and
rarts of mines from which the ores were
takers, the depth of shaft, the description
of ore, agrrrt pate size of reef, when and

AD VJ-mTISKTVreNTS.WITH the waning of her forty-ninth year of statehood California began to celebrate
her entrance into a second half century of prosperity. There was all the charac
teristic Califorhian lavishncss in the wealth of color, the gleam of lights, the glare
and thunder of fireworks and the shifting, shuffling tide of people that filled
the streets and ebbed and flowed in the r1o\v of the lamps.
The city is full of visitors. Since Friday they had been coming in from the
north and south and east, until it seemed as if the streets would hold no more: but still thev
came, and there are nwc to come, for this will be the proudest birthday of the century, and
no true son of California can afford to miss the feast. iV. ! -
The Pioneers had a little celebration of their own during the afternoon, where by
speeches and patriotic songs the blood was set coursing the faster through the veins of the
State-builders, and they cheered the name of California â the child of their toil, their adven
turous spirit and their citizenship. The parlors of Native Sons already in the citv received
their friends during the afternoon and earlv evening, for the Native Son is nothing if not so-
Ctable, and he multiplies his pleasure by seeking companions to help him enjoy himself.
And then *\s darkness fell and the swinging lines of lamps commenced to sparkle, every
one sought the streets, and then the water front and the hills that look out over the bav. for
it was on the bay that the great celebration would, really, open; And like a statclv minuet,
danced in ; the. light of a giant torch, it did open, the vessels changing, winding, turning and
passing and rep issing each other in the glare of flaming barges, like dancers on a ballroom
floor. The vessels were aglow with Chinese lanterns, nnd so outlined in the moonlieht they
made a rare picture â one beyond brush and palette and nainter's art.
The bav parade was marred by the sinking of the May Flint, a big coal-laden ship that
fouled the steel beak of the Iowa. The Flint was sailing in. and when just ahead of the
Iowa the wind failed her. She wavered in the tide a few minutes and then drove down

the skies; watch the million sparks of
fire as they fell and illumined the path
of scores of vessels plowing through the
bay. San Francisco and its friends
crowded the main thoroughfares of the
town. Lights Mazed and flashed from
every point where the eye could see.
Market street was sin avenue of light.
Thousands of electric bulbs biased forth
their illumination to light up the brilliant
decorations with' which the streets were
adorned. The standards of gay color; the
flagi of the Union and of the State, and
the myriad silhouettted laces of people
hurryirs to and fro, gave testimony to
how San Francisco is celebrating the. fif
tieth birthday of California.
The Native Sons ( of California have:done
their work well. The streets last night
were a revelation of beauty. Nothing had
been left undona to make' the. city a pic
ture such as it had not been ever before.
When darkness came the people of San
Francisco and the tens of thousands of
visitors who had come. to see the'celebra
tion of the semi-centennial of Callfornian
statehood" triroofced' the 'streets. From
every point they crowded into the main
thoroughfare of the city, until Market
street was one black mass of moving men
and women, until the walks were inade
quate to contain the throng ajid the street
Itself was usurped to nccommodate the
moving crowd that progressed toward the
water front. There from the heights, upon
the wharves, from every point of vantage
they watched the brilliant spectacle that
inaugurated San Francisco's tribute to
California.
Ships of every description moved in
stately procession around the bay. The
blackness of the night was Illumined by
the fires of iridescent light that shot
from stationed ships. Rockets, bombs,
vari-colored lights, burst into the air. A
fire ship stationed in the harbor gave
forth Its brilliant illumination and then,
at a signal, was transformed into a blaz
ing pile. Around the bay. the procession
of ships passed. Now and again. a bril
liant light in tho harbor would illumine
the vessels as they passed and show them
adorned in. all the gayety of color, and on
every eld o on emblem of national life* . s
Now and again from the city heights
would come j:h'eer after cheer as the ships
passed, to signal what Â¦ the people of San
Francisco thought of .^California's half
century of. existence.' Â¦â¢.,
There is little question that in San
Francisco , to-day there are more people
than there ever were in the- history of
the city. The streets are thronged almost
to a condition of being impassable.' The
shops, restaurants 'and places of refresh
ment are thronged. The private homes of
the city have been taxed- to accommodate
those who se^k rooms. Street cars, places
of amusement, rendezvous of â¢ recreation
and the resorts of public convenience are
crowded to tho utmost' capacity.
The city is in holiday garb. The people
are on dress parade. Houses of business
have suspended operation and San-Fran
cisco Is celebrating with all its will the
day which the people will see only once.
As already indicated the celebration of
Admission day- began last night by the
superb paradeon thÂ« bay. * The arrange
ments had been made almost perfect, but
unfortunately,- la "> the darkness' of "the
night, there was a collision.,. Other than
that there was no accident. .
The splendidly adorned ships passed in
gay procession, carrying from point' to
point their thousands of enthusiastic citi
zens. The waters of the bay were lit up
by the brilliant color of the lights that
flashed from station to station. National
warships blazed [forth their intense lights
to illumine now. and again '. shadows on
the water.,. front. : The .ferry depot ; was
outlined in a. blaze of light.. There was
music, from every passing boat and laugh
ter from thousands Â¦ of.- 1 men and women
as. they mingled in companionship In the
celebration of California's half-century of
admission into the Union. The celebration
was .well, begun and gave absolute promise
that the fete days which" are â¢ to follow
will mark the most significant demonstra
tion In; the history, of the State.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1900.

32Promenade Concert Which;
Thousands of People
Atterjded.
FOR three hours last evening the spa
cious corridors of the ferry station
were crowded with celebrators. The
long hallways made fine promenades
and a. band concert helptd to enliven
the occasion.
The decorations in the upper corridors
were quite elaborate, consisting of palms
and potted plants, red, white and blue
bunting and American flags and shields.
There were also a number of stars made
of spangled tljsuo paper anil these were
hung up on the walls, while at each of
the two extreme ends of the main pas
sageway was a typical California bear
with outstretched paw pointing to the
word "Shake" in red electric bulbs. The
outline of the bears was in white bulbs.
It is estimated that between 20,000 and
30,000 people visited the building during
the evening, and many stopped to listen
to the music after the naval parade.
Features of the concert were an anni
versary march written for the occasion
by H. J. Seegelken; overture, "Norma";
comic opera medley, "Tid-Blts"; Spanish
dances; the "Lohengrin Bridal Chorus,"
and the "Blue and tne Gray/*
The corner of Market and Third streets
was one 'congested mass of humanity
from dusk until after midnight. There
wasn't a better spot In the city from
which to view the illuminations. A tem
porary band etand was fitted up next to
The Call building, and here a band de
lighted the several thousand listeners with
national airs, medleys and waltaee. The
crowd showed Its appreciation of the more

all there were about 150 people on the
platform. . ,
For the first time since ships began ,to
be launched at the Union Iron Work** a
slight miscalculation was made in the
preparations and the ceremony was? eleven
minutes late. The launch was slated to
occur- at 10:55 o'clock, but it was 11:06
T- - .hen the sound of hammers ceased and
the signal bell rang.
The pressing of a button released the
knife of a diminutive electric guillotine
that had been erected on the platform.
The knife cut a cord and a pendulum
weight was released and knocked away
the "trip" shore, letting the "dog" shore
drop from its place.
The champagne bottle used In christen
ing was broken into bitsâ a good omenâ
and people scrambled for the pieces as
souvenirs. Others carried away pieces of
the splintered shores and keel blocks.
IN THE NAVE OF
THE FERRY DEPOT
at the ferry landing at the foot of Market
street yesterday, for each ferry-boat that
came from the other side of the bay was
crowded with strangers to take part in the
celebration. J. E. U'Donnell, chairman of
the reception committee, and a corps of
assistants were on hand to welcome the
members of the visltinjjparlors, and he
had at his command two bands of music,
which were employed to escort the visit
ing Native Sons to their respective head
quarters. There were also members of the
reception committee at each of the other
places where passengers land. The Native
Daughters' reception committee was on
hand in one of the rooms of the ferry
building. By 4 o'clock there had come to
this city more than 30,000 strangers, and
they kept coming from that time on until
9 o'clock at night.
An Artistic Effect.
During the day and in the evening there
was concert music in the grand nave of
the ferry building, which is tastefully
decorated.
It takes an artist to produce an artistic
effect. The proof of this assertion can be
scon In the effect produced by a corps of
artisans on Bushneii's gallery on Market
street, near City Hall square. For three
days the labor of decorating- the gallery
has progressed urtdtr the direction of Miss
Nora Quinlan. who during Mr. Bushnell's
absence Is in charge of the gallery.- From
the architrave of the building the national
colors are grouped In streamers which are
gathered below in cornucopias and held
with rosettes. Between the streamers
stars of reÂ«l and gold and spangled shields
are hung en pendante. A sign of "Wel
come"' woven In a blaze of light stands
out in the foreground, while over the en
trance an electric flag reflects the red,
white and blue. The entrance Is draped
in blue and gold. California's rolors. This
is In honor of Governor Gago and staff,
who will Bit next Tuesday for portraits
ajid groups. The general grouping of the
decorations is most pleasing; in fact, the
scheme executed under Miss Quinlan's di
rection Is among the most artistic In the
city. . .
Objects to Phelan.
A subcommittee of the literary commit
tee waited on Governor Gage yesterday
and asked him tiÂ» deliver an address at
the literary exercises at Native Sons'
Hall on Monday night. He declined the
honor tendered with thanks, saying that
he did not care to talk on the same even

Pioneer Women's Reception.

mRS. McENDAW of 3127 Twenty
first street witnessed the naval
parade under great difficulties.
She was standing at the corner
of East and Howard streets, and con
fined her attention strictly to the fire
works, as viewing the parade from where
she stood was out of the question. Be
coming tired of looking skyward for such
a length of time she yawned, and from
then on Mrs. MeEndaw cared little for
parade or fireworks.
In some, unaccountable manner the
lady's jaw became dislocated, and such
was her predicament sho was unable to
inform her friends â¢what ailed her. With
mouth open and surrpunded by friends
asking unanswerable questions, Mrs. Mc-
Endaw stood, and soon became the pyno
sure of all eyes. Tho situation presented
itself in a funny light to those in the
crowd, but the friends of the lady be
came alarmed and hurried her to the Har
bor Hospital.
On examination by Dr. Putnam it de
veloped that the lady had a severe case
of tired feeling some time ago, and in ex
pressing her feelings in a similar manner
had dislocated her jaw. After treatment
she was Bent to her home in the care of
friends.
Fell Twenty Feet.
Miss Emily Mitchell of 6 Twenty-second
street, Oakland, went to the water front
last evening to see the naval parade. Ac
companied by three friends, Philip Wesser
of Oakland, J. Doherty of Seventh avenue
and Mrs. Edwards, she went up in the
coal bunkers of Dunsmulr & Co at Steuart
and Foteom streets seeking a place where
they could better see the parade. In the
darkness Miss Mitchell lost her footing
and fell twenty feet and then slid down an
iron coal chute. But for the fact that the
lower end of the chute was closed she
would probably have been killed. Mr
Wesser narrowly escaped having a fali
down the same chute. ,/ Â¦
After some time Miss Mitchell was taken
to the water front hospital for treatment
by Policeman George Otterson. There It
was found that she did not have any
broken bones and was not seriously In
jured. She was Quite badly bruised and
had a severe nervous shock.
Meeting the Guests,
There was a- genuine rush, of strangers
familiar airs by mingled applause and
cheers.
INCIDENTS OF THE
BIG CELEBRATION
SEE'S off: The massive mold of
iron and steel had been released;
the ponderous thing seemed to
r;u!ver for a moment as pretty
jTraaoes Warren splashed the
eparEim? Â¦w-^e. and then, like a young |
colt given Its first freedom, the mighty
idog of war shot defiantly down the steep
incline Into e. tranquil sea. The American
navy's newest terror, the monitor Wyom-
Jr.gr, had b*en launched. And as she sped
tdong. leaving a lane, of snowy white foam
In her wake. 20,<p<y> people cheered lustily,
Â¦while the weird screeching of countless
Fteamers, tug* and launches added to the
din.
It -was a. remarkable scene â that accom
panying the chrlst<rii!r.g of Uncle Sam's
rew eea. defenderâ which was witnessed
e.t the Potrero at 31 o'clock yesterday
morning. It was a scene a.t one-; thrilling
and Inspiring. It was a fcene that the old
have beheld before and, would easrerly wit
ness araln. It was a seen* that fired
every patriotic heart and that impressed
the young tvlth the significance of a na
tion's defense. Although far from being
completed, the very crudeness of the big
beat awakened within one a spirit of won
der and amazement as he marveled at
man's craftsmanship.
The ceremonies proved a fitting com
mer-cement of California's Eeml-centen
nla! celebration. Long before the appoint
Â«Â»d hrwr for the christening to take place
there were signs of activity around the
Immense dock from which tre boat was.
to be launched. The engineers, the me
chanics and in fact ail the men who
helped to mold the craft into form an.l
thape from the time the keel was started
in April. 1S3.J. were on hand at tin early
iiour and busied themselves in demolish
ing the wedges and blocks which held the
beat secure and in preparingAhe ropes
Â«xd anchors that were to hold her sta
tionary when deep water was reached.
And as they labored the crowds began to
gather on the. water front.
The monitor lay with her stern toward
the water. The hull is painted a grayish
pink, while the armor shelf, deck and
turret are coated with a brick-colored
taint, intended for use, not ornament.
Just in lrcnt of tho bow a temporary plat
form had teen constructed to accommo
date the inviied puests and those who
were to participate in the ceremonies. The
platform railings were entwined with vari
colored hurting. At the stern and bow
cf the boat the glorious istars and stripes
waved majestically, the bright colors
forming a striking contrast to the gTimy
surroundings.
At 10:45 a detachment of marines from
the battleship Iowa, accompanied by the
Iowa's band, marched into the yards of
the T'nion Iron Works and took a. position
alongside the platform. The crowd had
by this t5me swelled from hundreds to
thcut.anns and every conceivable place
from the mast of a schooner to the lofty
trellis work of near-by drjdocks was oc
cupied by those eager to get a good view
ing point.
Crowds Came to See.
the yards of the company -were
'Cf.ng filled up with humanity the water
froct presented a pretty spectacle. The
shore for a lonf distance was dotted with
people and the roofs of the neighboring
rtocJchouses were black with spectators.
The scene was enlivened by steamers and
tugs which steamed up slowly to a point
of vast&jr3 tilth their decks crowded with
meg, jroiaea,. acd children. Launches and
rowboats darted in and out of the small
openings between the larger craft and
made things interesting as they rocked
and tumbled about in the high rolling
waves made by a passing steamer.
The last block had been hacked away
from under the boat and all eyes were
riveted upon her. The sudden scurrying
of the small craft in front of the pier
from which the monitor was to slide was
the signal to the people on the shore and
in the boats that all was ready.
Miss Francis Warren, becomingly
gowned in a blue tailor-made suit, stepped
modestly forward and with outstretched
hand emptied the foaming contents of a
champagne bottle down the s'lde of the
noblo shin's bow. Then, as the wine was
yet dripping and sparkling in the golden
sunlight. Miss Edna Bartlett of Cheyenne
touched the electric button which released
the "dog shore," the final support which
hold more than two and a half million
pounds stationary, and away went Uncle
Sam's new terror of the s?a.
The lioat glided down the Incline as
smoothly as if on iron runners. As she
struck the water the point of her stern
rut drop, throwing spray on either side
that rose high in the air and then seemed
t<> burst into mvriads of tiny, white drops
that grlistened like miniature meteors in
the radiant sunlight.
A Riotous Greeting.
As she sr>ed along there was one grand
outburst of noise from the excited specta
tors, reinforced by the heavy fog horn of
the steamboat, the shrill whistle of the
tup and the saucy toots of steam and
naphtha launches. It was a great Imita
tion of the late P. T. Barnum's famous
steam calliope. The demonstration con
tinued until the monitor had anchored
about t/<0 yards from the point of launch
ing. The Iowa's band played the "Star
hpanprled Banner" and the "Red, "White
and Rluc," the crowd joining In the chor
uf. It was exactly six minutes past 11

The reappearance of the brighter stars
at different seasons of the year, their
height above the horizon, the angular dis
tance between them, eclipses and the mo
tions of the sun, moon and planets were
made the subject of careful study in Asia
and Egypt at least 5000 to 6000 years ago,
and perhaps at a still earlier stage of
human history. Lockyer believes that
many of the oldest temples In Egypt were
oriented with reference to the rising of
certain stars. There Is a Chaldean work
on astronomy that dates back to 3S0O B
C. and It is within the range of possi
bility that something more ancient may
>et be found in Babylonia. The earlles"t
record now known of a solar eclipse hap
pens to be Chinese, and Is 4000 years old.
In view of the well established antiquity
of astronomy and astrology, the odd little

which is said to be 300 years old, might bÂ«
comparatively modern. And so it is. in a

The singer's voice is not naturally *

sometimes In the planlsstmos. Her Intona
tion Is also uncertain at times and her
lower notes forced. But -.hen in tempo
rary forgetf ulr.ess of her surroundings
the singer gained a line draxnatic powÂ»r
and sang full and clearly In her strong
upper tones ar.d allowed her natural arc
of rendering full play one forpot every
thing: "lse in the pleasure. Her ending of

And even . further. As genius, in a wide
sense, is properly the possession of the
nation^ and its encouragement in all Its
forms a matter, of national Importâ for
the only lasting glory of a people is Its
art expression â It Is the Intimate concern
of every good citizen to remove any
known obstacle in the path of its free and
full development. All of which latter is
prelude to the statement that I, along
with many other musicians, would ven
ture to advise, the retirement, for a time
at least, of our little California genius
from the concert platform.
So far La Paloma has been most wisely
dealt with. Practicing rarely more than
two hours s a day. and that at her own
good pleasure; till two years ago given
the-best teaching within her parents' lim
ited means; turned loose in the woods and
fields for long weeks in the summer; sur
rounded by doves and dolls and tret?a and
flowers in her pretty Los Ange!es home,
and given the, opportunity of a European
tour in which she met almost every musi
cian of note, her life has so far been well
and. wisely ordered. Her recitals, neither
too numerous nor too arduous, have been
a ecurce of 'inspiration to both player and
listener. Given the divine right of genius,
the right conditions of development, as in
this case, it would reasonably appear that
the child musician has> a right to an un
prejudiced hearing, to the encouragement
and inspiration that public sympathy
means to most muslc-al temperaments,
and even the same right to enjoy the
financial result of the possession of ex
ceptional talent as is accorded to the
older performer. All this and more hus
beÂ«n generously given to her talented
daughter by Irer native State, and so far
the benefit has been a mutual one, but
the balance begins to be disturbed. When
Paloma made her first appearance two
years ago at the age of nine her remark
able performance aroused much favorable
comment. Her technique was good, her
tone full and round, her Interpretation*
artistic, her repertoire Interesting, and her
improvisations, thÂ«*n as now. unmistak
ably the product of i genius. I have heard
child-wonders improvise before, among
them little Jcsef Hoffmann, then 10 yeara
old, In England in ISST, and oven his per
formance was mechanical, childish, hesi
tant compared with the fluent and mature
impromptu musical expressions of the lit
tle California girl. -
. That was two years ago. To-day thÂ«
situation is somewhat different. La Pa
loma Is now In her twelfth year, no longer
a child wonder. She has not studied seri
ously since her first appearance in 189S.
Her tone has gained in strength perhaps,
her fingers in fluency, but not to the ex
tent that the passage of two years should
warrant- Her repertoire has been en
larged, but the recent additions, evidently
acquired without supervision, are ren
dered in superficial and incorrect fashion
and "edited" to an extent that only Pa-.
loma's inimitable savoir falre makes
plausible.
AH this, be it understood, exists coin
cidently with the purest musical feeling,
the most musical Â«bnception of her sub
jects, the keenest feeling for tone grada
tions, the finest sense of the ideals of her
art, but this all ne^d3 wise direction, and
now Is the accepted time.
If this may be and If this small feminine
Mozart may have her rightful due in the
-matter of training at this stage of her
careerâ and it i3 surely worthy of the
most earnest effortâ I venture to prophesy
for California the possession of perhaps
the first great woman composer, it not
performer, that the world has known.
Of course. It is lamentably true that In
the case of the child-genius the possibili
ties oMmnositlon and abuse are limitless,
and difficult of correction. Lazy and
avaricious parents take cruel advantage
of their helplens; talented offspring, de
prive them of all the natural Joys of child
hood ,and overdevelop their exceptional
gift at the expense of the rest of their
faculties', until It would sometimes seem
that child and public were more wisely
deprived - altogether of the right of hear
ing and being heard rather than that one
of these little ones should so suffer from
this parental cannibalism. And here the
right of . public Interference properly
comes in." Shall an unwilling infant bÂ«
driven to a distasteful musical servitude,
a frail child to a merciless round of labor,
a baby-Mozart to an eternal drudgery, to
satisfy the greed of those who should be
the little ode's natural protectors? Pro
test is reasonable and interference a duty.
-Â¦ Personally I am In favor of the public
appearance of the "wunderklnd," pro
vided music bo its native air in the full
â¢ sense in which the atmosphere is breath
to the nostrils of the small genius in
question. Paloma plays the piano as an
other child pats a mud pie: scribbles her
"notes"â her simple phrase for her small
compositionsâ as the average infant
scrawls amorphous elephants on a shriek
ing slate; improvises, nocturne, march and
waltz as her contemporary pickaninnies
"make up" marvelous tales of ghost and
giant; plays tag with her fingers, instead
! of her feet, with the same natural im-
pulse that leads her little confreres to the
! latter way of the game. In short, to her
.music is the inevitable means of imagina
tive,expressionâ the natural outlet for her
childish energies. It is her normal lan
guage and no more to be deprecated or
repressed than any other legitimate mode
of expression.
M-yHE recent recitals of the little mu
1 steal genius from Los -Angeles. Pa
9 loma Schramm. have revived inter
' Â¦*â¢ est In the ever-vexed question of
child-wonder performance?, their

right to be.

Another device in the collection, look-
Ing like an upright pump and its handle,
may have been used in measure the angu
lar altitude of objects In the northern
skies. But whether thl3 surmise be cor
rect or not, it is clear that the apparatus
itself long since ceased to be of any ser
vice. The Chinese are not a progressive
people. They probably cannot grasD either
the technique or the mathematics of the
most advanced astronomical practice of
to-day. But they long ago learned enough
to eee the uselessness of the instruments
here described, which are interesting only
as curious relics of an effete civilization.
Bcientiflc astronomical work begran with
the recognition 300 or 400 years ago of the
fact that the earth Is a sphere rotating on
its axis, and that the heavens are sta
tionary. Moreover, a vast proportion of
the knowledge possessed to-day regarding
the stars has been acquired by means of
the telescope,. which was not known three
centuries ago. Indeed, so enormous have
been the advances made since the time of
Galileo, and so little progress was achiev
ed from the days of Ptolemy to those of
Copernicus, that the Chinese astronomer
could not have had a much better Instru
mental equipment in 1000 than at the be-
Binnlng of the Christian era. At any rate,
that of the abandoned Peking observatory
Is exceedingly primative, and it would
puzzle experts In stellar science to say
exactly what were Its functions.
As their records show, the ancients at
tempted little more than to note the height
of various conspicuous objects above thÂ«Â»
horizon, their relative distance from each
other and the time of year when they
were most conveniently situated for obser
vation. For these purposes they needed
only simple devices. One of their best
known pieces of apparatus was an "armil
lary sphere," a combination of brass cir
cles rotating on an axis that was suf
ficiently inclined to aim at the point about
which the heavens seemed to revolve. One
might be disposed to take some of the ob
jects in the old Peking observatory for ar
millary spheres, but they are lacking in
certain Important features. Hence If tfiese
instruments were founded to serve the
purpose of an armillary sphere they must
have done so Inadequately. They are very
rudimentary in character. It is not in
credible that time and the weather have
not only rendered these old Chinese relics
useless, but have also deprived them of
some of their original features. A good
many thines might happen to objects left
for centuries in so exposed a situation.
However, without a close scrutiny of the
instruments made on the spot It would
be Impossible to say with confidence what
changes and losses had occurred.'

The Census Bureau at Washington has
Sjmounced thÂ« population of Oakland as
6*,Sâ¬Q, as against 4S,â¬S2 for 1830. an increase
cJ 1S.TS in ten years, or 37.55 per cent. The
population. In 1870 was 10.500. In 18S0 It was
84,555. ThÂ« percentage of increase for the
dec&fie of 1S30 was 40.SS per cent. The fig
urea for 1200 show, therefore, a slight de
crÂ«aee In the proportionate #aln of popu
lation.
The population by city wards for this
ceaeus Is as follows: First Ward. 726o:
Second TVard. 9722; Third Ward. 90G0;
Fourth Ward. 93C9: Fifth Ward. 7SC6: Sixth
"Ward, 11.661; Seventh Ward. 11.417.
While the total Is a trifle disappointing
to the citizens of Oakland, the increase in
population i? substantial and maintains a
ffood ratio by comparison with returns
from other cities. The expectation of a
70,000 or more total was based upon the
estimated pop>:'.aiion of the recently an
nexed territory. It is manifest from the
figures herewith that the exodus of popu
lation 6hortly after the railroad strike had
a. material effect upon the gain. Ten years
ero the Southern Pacific Company was
employing a very large force, and that has
been materially depleted during the last
jjve ycars.
There has been a. large isrrowth in sub
urban population, but In districts outside
of the Incorporated limits of the city.
While the gain benefits Oakland commer
cially it has rot resulted in swelling the
population of the city.
The figures of 1900 blast the hopes of the
postoffice employes, who had been look
ing for such an increase as would put
Oakland In the first class and give them
m.n increase in pay. As the minimum first
class figure is 75.000. the Postofflce Depart
raent -will continue to run on its present
eeale lor some time.

There will be an inqitest sit Irvington
next Wednesday evening. Mrs. Rix left
a husband and four children. The family
had resided for many years at Irvington.
The fact also that Mrs. Rix had been
under treatment of Christian Scientists
was deemed of importance by the doctor
and a report was made to Deputy Coro
ner J. J. Mottel, who notified the Coroner
at once. .
After death came the physician was re
quested to sign a certificate Riving cause
of death so the body could be given in
terment without official interference. Un
der the circumstances the doctor posi
tively refused to act, the law requiring
that a doctor to be competent to sign a
death certificate must have been in at
tendance at least twenty-four hours be
fore the death of the patient.
I Mrs. Rix died at 3 o'clock this morn-
Ing. A few hours before her demise Dr.
Welles of Ir\;instoti was summoned, but
as the, patient was then dying the phy
sician was helpless and could only render
the last aid to the dying patient.
Coroner llehrmann has been called to
investigate the circumstances surround
ing the death to-day of Mrs. A. L. Rix,
an old resident of Irvington, who has
been In the hands of Christian Scientists
for several days under treatment, pre
sumably for pneumonia.

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 8.â Out on the
eastern limits of the city of Sacra
mento, the capital of the State,
there stood a few years ago the
veather-bea?*>n and crumbling ruins of
the most noted landmark of American civ
ilization on the Pacific Coastâ the old Sut
ter Fort. But. thanks to the Pioneers of
Sacramento, the Order of Native Sons of
the Golden West and the liberality of the
Legislature, those old ruins have under
gone a wonderful transformation. In their
Ftead now rise the walls of a complete
fortâ a perfect reproduction of the one
that General Sutter erected on that spot
5"earÂ» before sold was discovered In Cali
fornia.
Putter's Fort is an object of deep inter
est to every man, woman or child that
crossed the plains In the early days pre
ceding cr immediately following the gold
discovery. For them it posse^?es a rever
ence and a charm that will go with them
to their grave?, and for coming genera
tions Jt -will possess a deep interest so long
rs or.e adobe brirk remains to mark the
birthplace of American civilization in Cali
fornia. About this interesting pile of ma-
Fonrj- â which stands to-day as did the
â¢Â¦Â¦rigir.aJ fort, with the Fame ancient can
non guarding the entrance to the main
f-tructureâ there is a halo of glory, es
pecially apparent to the fast disappearing
liand of argonauts, that all the fast
rrowding events of this energetic, money
pÂ»-tting and history making generation
â¢ ar.net dispel.
"gutter's Fort!" -was the watchword
hf-ard all along the line of emigrant trains
That crossed the plains in IMS from the
Missouri River to the Then silvery waters
of the Sacramento. Thousands of men
iire living to-day in this State who owe
to General John A. Sutter. its founder,
rhpir very existence. When people were
dying of "hunger and hardships out along
the desert roads that stretched away to
ward t!iÂ»> rising sun. it was there, in the
memorable fall r.f 1S4\ that relkf train*
were organized and sent to their rescue
with provisions and medicines. No person
John A. Sutter came to California In 1S3S
cr 1S3?. and about 1S41 became a citizen of
the republic of Mexico. Juan B. Alvarado,
the then Mexican Governor, whose head
quarters were at Monterey, gave Sutter a
grant of eleven leagues of land, wherever
lie might choose to select it. Having made
his selection, he set about erecting build
ings after tho Mexican or old Spanish
style, which might not only serve as a
comfortable- home, but afford protection
from hostile Indians.
Most of the wcirk around the fort in 1S46
was done by cither tame or wild Indians.
The tame Indiana were those who had
been caught while young by Sutter when
he first came to California. By clothing
and treating them kindly lie had brought
them into submission and taught them t f >
do various kinds of useful work. He hard
twenty or thirty of these tame Indians
organized into a military company, which
â¢was the garrison of tho fort. The cap
tain drilled them regularly and taught
them to mount guard and keep watch.
During the night, at every hour, the voice
of the Indian watchman could he heard
calling, "All's weH:"
These tame Indian* soon learned to de
spise the naked, filthy savages from
whom they were descended. They would
deny their race and were insulted if they
Â¦were called Indians'. Recognizing the su
periority of the Spanish and Mexicans,
they soon picked up Spanish and Mexican
words, and thus a few of them learned to
speak Spanish with some fluency. Be
sides their military duties the tame In
dians made themselves quite useful In
performing menial duties around the fort.
It hhs one of Sutter's employes. James
Sutter's Fort was the nucleus of the
present capital of the State. Its far-see
ing founder selected its site as the most
available in all the broad valley of the
Sacramento for the establishment of a
civilization that must, in the natural
course of events, reach the lovely shores
of the Pacific. After gold was discovered
it became the central point for the distri
bution of supplies throughout the mines,
and thus gave Sacramento its first impulse
as a business center.
has ever attempted to write a history or
sketch of California without a recital of
the circumstances which led to the erec
tion of Sutter's Fort and the part it
played In the subsequent development and
settlement of the State.
The Native Pons of 'he Golden Wf>Â«t,
into whose keeping the Sfnte has Intrusted
the propertv. are now endeavorine to havÂ»
the city of Sa^rament^ purchase tho block
of land fronting on the f^rt and have it
transformed into a beautiful park.
From that time on the once-famous
Putter Fort had little attention paid to it.
At one lime it was occupied as a chicken
ranch. Many years ngo the property was
purchased bv the Assoeiation of Pioneers
and the walls of the fort repaired some
what, in the hope of preserving the old
linrtmaHt of civilization on the Pacific
Slope. Even then it was an Interesting ob
leot from its association with the past.
but in Its rehabilitated condition it is
even more so, and manv a pioneer has
traveled hundreds of miles to gaze on the
old fort, inspect the rare old reUe<? of the
days o'f forty-r)In<* that are stored within
its walls and to dream again of the oa^t.
with all its vivid reminiscences of thrlll
ine scenes.
The rush of immigrants hitherto soon
changed the condition of things about the
fort. Stores of various kinds sprang up.
and for a time it seemed as if the old fort
was to become the center of a commercial
oity. But ships soon began to come up
tho river with merchandise from Eastern
ports and the present city of Sacramento
was laid out on the river bank. Then the
storekeeoers nt Slitter's Fort closed their
plaeÂ©*Â»<if business and came into the. new
and growing city, and within a short time
the old fort was abandoned, its founder
becoming an active and prominent flcrure
in bu.-iness circle for a time and then
removing to the Kast.
Marshall, who found in the American
River the bit of gold which threw the
whole civilized world into a fever of ex
citement and precipitated the settlement
of California by the whitesâ a result
which would, however, have been only
a question of time. Marshall rode through
the rain one stormy night in March. IMS,
from Coloma to Sinter's Fort with his
piece of yellow metal and could not go to
rest until he had aroused Sutter. The lat
ter made a chemical test of the metal and
pronounced It gold. Marshall rode back
through the woods in all haste through a
torrent of rain and hurricane of wind to
spread the news among his fellow-work
men, and from that moment the excite

limits of the two continents.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The Breed representatives maintain
that the County Committee has been
legally organized and that the nine mem
bers who did not join in the organization
are welcome to take their seats at any
time and be recognized, provided the rule
adopted declaring vacancies by absente-3
from four consecutive metlngs Is not vio
lated.
Commit teeman Mock, -who Is opposed trÂ»
the Breed wing, said: "If there can be a
harmonizing of conflicting elements In
the County Committee the State Central
Committee will do all In its power In an
advisory way to accomplish, that end.
But it seems to me that the only way this
can be accomplished is by reorganization
of the entire committee on a fair baste."
"Why do they hold these meetings In
the evening?" he said. "They know that
members from the country will not coma
down here to Oakland and stay all night
for a mere committee meeting. I
haven't any Idea what the members who
have not joined in the Breed organization
will do. To-day's meeting was called be
cause the State Central Committee de
sired it.'-
The Breed forces which have organized
were not In evidence at Jud i Quinn*
courtroom this afternoon at the hour
mentioned In the call. They recognize
no call but their own. under -which, fbrit
half of the committee formed an'" elect
ed a chairman and secretary and adopted
rules. The Lanktree nine refuse to rec
ognize the Breed committee aa leg-ally or
ganized and their Intention to-day wa*
to determine upon some line, of action. A*
matters stand on the surface it is nine
to nine, but the rumor is persistent that
a member from the Forty-sixth District
has pone into the Breed camp. Whether
that be true will remain for the future to
determine. The Breed men have called a
meeting for Tuesday evening.
Committeeman J. H. TV. Rlley said that
call -was unfair.
Upon a request from the Republican
State Central Committee the meeting
called by the Lanktree half of the County
Committee was abandoned to-day. Com
mitteeman T. F. Mock ol the Forty-ninth
District arrived from San Francisco with
ihe message from the State Committee
Â«nd those who had assembled decided v.Â»
heed the request. It was tased upon the
ground that the meeting would interfere
with efforts which will be made to har

that Rev. XV. B. Anderson be transferred

he will be not returned.

The charges of immorality filed against,
Rev. Wj B. Anderson of Sacramento were
investigated this morning by the judl
rjary committee of the African Methodist
Episcopal Conference, consisting of John
Pointer, chairman; E. T. Cottman, J. E.
Edwards. P. R. Green and K. T. Collins.
The committee acquitted the pastor of
the charge, but mildly censured him for
Imprudence;
W. J. Thompson, now of Los Angele?.
sent to the' conference an accusation
sworn to before a notary which v.ent into
detail concerning the alleged improprie
ties. This statement was read before the
committee in executive session, after
which the pastor was given a hearing.
He denied emphatically the main portions
of the accusation and presented a letter
of confidence from his congregation. No
other witnesses appeared, and after con
siderable deliberation tlfe following re
port was made: f
To the Hishop and members of the confer

and guess how many there were of each.

of laborers and such large investments of cap
ital being abandoned to hostile methods for set
tlement aroused uneasiness among holders and
operators in securities. Yesterday's recovery
in Brooklyn Transit gave place to a relapse
to-day and People's Gas continued weak. In
spite of an effort to make it appear that the
Chicago Gas was covered by an understanding
between the contending companies. A large
demand from the shorts rallied the stock and
L>racMcaUy all the loss waÂ» recovered. The
weak bank return failed to affect the market.
The movement of currency to the interior has
evidently been muck larger than the prelim
inary estimates indicated. It is evident also
that the banks have been obliged to draw on
their legal tenders to meet this demand. The
stock market made a false start again this
week, after the three days of idleness and
after a brief flurry of activity dropped back
into Its lethargy and prices sagged again to
the former level. The general Investment or
speculative world was not a participant in
the deaiings at any time, but there waa some
evidence of bolder and larger operations of a
professional character which were supposed to
be Aue to the re-entry of some of the larger
leaders recently returned from vacations
abroad. The board room professionals, who
have attributed the prevailing dullness to po
litical cause, expected that the determination
of the Vfrmont electoral contest would lead
to come activity. The London stock market
was impressed with the same view and Ameri
can stocks were pushed up briskly on the Lon
don exchange on Wednesday morning before
the openinjc here. But the local market eagerly
availed itself of the London demand to unload
some heavy blocks. Later In the day stocks
were bought again In the hope that the de
mand from London would be renewed on Thurs
day, but that hope was quickly dissipated
oarly Thursday morning and London clearly
showed its disappointment at New York's fail
ure to co-operate tn the buying movement. The
disposition on the part of London to buy
stocks here was increased by the marked ease
of money at that center and the (renerally more
cheerful view held of international politics,
but the vigorous measure adopted by the Bank
of England by large borrowings from the open
market checked the downward tendency and be
g-ot an Intimation of knowledge of some future
demands to be made upon the money market.
Suggestions are heard of an additional British
loan to bÂ« placed and the presence In France
of the Russian Minister of Finance arouses
discii.sFion here of means to meet the Russian
demands. The London market hardened in
(.Â¦ons^quence and at the same time sterling ex
change weakened In New York under offering*
of cotton bills brought on the market by the
urgent buying of cash cotton to tide over the
English shortage. This dissipated the hopes
of London of a gold movement from New York.
It Is considered probable that future British
loans may seek a lodgment In New York with
a view to inducing further movement of gold
to London. The constant receipt by New York
banks of remittances on account of Klondike
gold and the current output of American
mines are both to be reckoned with In Judging
the cuettion of reserves.
A feature of the week was the strength or
silver on the demand for remittances from
China. The decrease In merchandise ship
ments to China on account of the trouble there
calls for shlaments of sliver against merchan
dise received from China. The apathy of cap
ital toward securities has been quite as marked
in the bond market as in stocks.

carrying roads was dealt In. The comparative
firmness of the coalers was partly due to the
recent large output of coal from the mines
and partly to a belief that the Etrlke might be

NEW YORK. Bent. 8.â The Financier says:
The statement of the Associated Banks of New
York for the week ending September 8 reflects
a somewhat greater degree of business activity
both In the matter of local call loans and with
the Interior. For the first time in a long- period
the banks have received less money than they
have forward-d to W'estern and Southern
j'olnts. They gained, it is true, as a result of
transactions with the sub- Treasury, but the
system of averages employed does not show the
exact balance and the various Institutions
probably hold more money than the totals In
dicate. The reported loss of cash holdings is
small, amounting to $323,600. but this, combined
with the extra reserve necessitated by the ex
pansion of $2,794, COO deposits, decreases the sur
plus a little more than $1,000,005, bringing the
total to $46,056,250. which Is very much higher
than at the corresponding periods over several
years past. The gain of II, 959.000 In loans was
rather larger than anticipated. The present
volume of the loan Item, amounting to nearly
$819,000,000. Is the highest of the year, and as
ajiy addition must necessarily enlarge deposits
and therefore Increase reserve requirements, it
will bÂ« seen that this, combined with a with
drawal of money to the Interior must operate
In the direction of lowering the surplus re
serve very rapidly. The principal point of in
terest Just at present is the eslmatrd require
ments for crop-moving purposes. Careful In
quiry extending over large areas of territory
leads to the Impression that the drain on New
York this year will be lese than usual, owing
to the abundance of the money at other centers,
but for all that, bankers of long experience are
cautious in Indorsing this opinion. One factor
that Is to be taken into consideration Is the
doubling of the circulation by national banks
at this center. It is expected that this money
will bÂ« used largely In interior remittances ajid
the effect will be to furnish a great deal of
currency without a radical reduction In re
serves. The country has to-day nearly, or
quite. $S0,O00.C0O of national bank currency more
than a year ago. and there Is no queetion that
it is to play an Important part in the fall
business now at hand.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
*_ : â : *
CHICAGO, Sept. S.â Dullness characteristic
of Saturday's short session pervaded the wheat
market throughout. The tone, however, was
firm. October opened VÂ»c higher at 73%@73Â»4c,
because Liverpool was steady and unwelcome
rains were again reported damaging wheat in
the Northwest. Following the opening Octo
ber, on selling by scalpers, touched 73 1 ,ic but
at the dip there was some buying. This stirred
up shorts and October advanced to 73"4@74c.
The close was firm. October ViifUc over yester
day at 73\c, the corn strength helping sustain
the market toward the end.
Corn waa moderately active and strong. Liv
erpool was Vid higher. October closed strong
%0 up at 3STi@39c.
Oats made a quiet beginning, but were more
active later. October closed ',4c higher at 21%c.
Provisions continued strong. Packers tight
ened the screws some to-day and shorts did
their best to cover. October pork closed 12Vic
higher, lard 10c up and ribs 12Vic better.

feats of horsemanship embraces such
names as the Rooney Trio, Edward Shipp,

-Â» The victim of the accident was the
father of Martin Stevens, the well-known
Police Court attorney. He was about 60
years old and formerly kept a grocery at

mARTIN V. STEVENS, a railroad
foreman residing at 4499 Seven

killed yesterday morning by the
San Jose train* due here at 10:33 a. m.
Stevens was working with a gang of men
on a railroad bridge near Colma, in San
Mateo County, when the "train came
along. The rest of the men got out of the
way, but Stevens was slow in obeying
the warning and the locomotive pilot
struck him. He was dragged for some
distance before the train was stopped and
was badly mangled. Ills unconscious

5AJCTA TERESA, worshiped as di
vine by the Yaqui Indians, ban
ished from her native land by the
Mexican Government on the charge
of fomenting uprisings among the red
men, excommunicated by the Catholic
church as a heretic and wandering over
the rarth to do good by her powers of
healing which she believes divine in or
igin â Santa Teresa has come to San Kran
clsco. The sad-eyed Mexican girl comes
among skeptical Anglo-Saxon civilization
with an air of zealous and unselfish devo
tion to suffering humanity; with a bear
ing devoid of assumption and with no
tinge of hypocrisy, but a wide-awake
press agent and an Interpreter will see
that htr material interests do not suffer.
They lend a coloring of end-of-the-cen
tury enterprise to the self-sacrificing
plans of the Jeanne d'Arc of the Yaquls.
Teresa Vrrta, or Santa Teresa, or Se
nora Teresa Roderigues, since she was
lately married to an Arizona Mexican of
that name, gave an audience to newspa
per men yesterday afternoon in a parlor
of the Golden West "Hotel, and tried In
their presence her powers of healing.
She was born twenty-eight years ago In
the little town of Sinaloa, Mexico. Her
parents were of the poor agricultural
class and she is uneducated to the degree
that she has not even heard of Joan of
Arc or Saint Theresa. She claims that
when she was 16 years old she went into
a tranco which lasted three months and
eighteen days. During that time she per
formed miracles of healing, though she
was unconscious of her acts. Since then
she has had occasional trances, and often
feels, she says, an influence that she can
noi explain and a guidance- which she be
lieves Is supernatural in her treatment of
disease.
"I believe In God," Santa Teresa said
through her interpreter, "and In his
ability and willingness to endow human
beings with a portion of his divine power
to banish pain and suffering.
"I have never encouraged the Indians
to revolt or led them to believe that I
am divine. I have r.one among them,
healing their sick and trying to relieve
thÂ«-ir wretchedness. 1 have been their
friend and In their ignorance they wor
shiped me. I pity the Indians of Sonora.

ON STEAMER NEWPORT
Santa Teresa also tried her magnetic
touch on the reporters. One of them had
had a roaring headache all day. and she
banished it by a few Svengali-llke passes.
It Is not believed he will suffer from head
ache untn he makes a night of it again.
Another of the reporters took treatment
for the verse-writing habit, but It is
feared the cure will not be permanent.
Santa Teresa will be at Metropolitan
Temple on alternate nights beginning
September 12 and lasting until September
19. She will treat the sick free of charge
at these meetings. She came to San Jose
recently from Arizona to treat a child
who was a paralytic and had been given
up to die. The child is getting well and
hundreds of wonderful cures In San Jose
are attributed to Santa Teresa, She
treated as many as a hundred persons a
day there. In El Paso she often treated
200 in a single day.
The patient who offered himself as a
sacrifice on the altar of, Investigation,
with reporters as assistant celebrants,
was P. J. Henndly, a commercial trav
eler, well known in San Francisco, who
for twelve years has been a sufferer from
hemiplepia, or paralysis of the lower por
tion of the body.
Banta Teresa had him stand before her
and she clasped his hands, his right hand
in her right and his left in her left, ami
fixed his gaze on her eyes. After a few
moments she released his hands and
placed her lingers on his temples, then
Ills shoulders, his arms, hips, and finally
his knees. Hennelly said afterward that
the sensation was much like that of a
strong magnetic battery, but without its
painful twinges. Under her influence he
could stand without the aid of his cane,
which he had not been able to do for
twelve years, and his knee joints seemed
to have gained greater flexibility.
"She certainly has wonderful magnetic
power." Hennelly said, "but I do not
think she has given me any relief that
will be permanent. I will say, however,
that the temporary effects of her treat
ment were wonderful."
as this country protects Its Indians.
But there they have no rights and I fear
they will be exterminated. I would do
anything for them, but I do not pretend
to have any power to lead them to bet
ter conditions. I can only heal their sick
and that I am not allowed to do."
Santa Teresa said she had left Guay
mas, El Paso, Nogales and other places
because of the contentions that her heal
ing had caused and- her fear that blood
shed would follow. She expressed the
greatest abhorrence for bloodshed and
strife and the cruel practices of her coun
trymen.
This strange woman is rather tall and
Blender. She has the grace and repoce
of her people. Her oyt-s and a mass of
raven-black hair add by contrast to the
waxy pallor of her complexion. Her
hands are slender and nervous.

the purpose of th* board to the different turn

!n erfler to acquaint myself more fully &s to
the wishes of the Â«ierma.n element of our com

TVilUam Placeman and Supervisor Branden

outlined by xnj self to them relative to physical
culture.
The board lntÂ«-n<5* nt It? earliest opportunity

stated that if the boarii riMOld require them to
teach a whole day they would find it necessary
to resign.

funds will not permit its installation this
year. We b<--!ieve heart;ly in physical cul
