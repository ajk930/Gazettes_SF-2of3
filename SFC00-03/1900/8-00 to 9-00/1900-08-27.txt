MASSACRE OF THIRTY-SEVEN FOREIGN MISSIONARIES
SHANGHAI, Aug. 24. â Mr. Morgan of the China Inland Mission, who has arrived here from
Si Xganfu, reports that thirty-seven foreign missionaries and thirty converts have been mas
sacred at Taivuenfu.
LONDON, Aug. 27, 4:20 a. m. â Dispatches from Shanghai state that the Japanese Govern
ment has notified Earl Li that negotiations will be impossible until plenipotentiaries accept
able to the powers are appointed. Japan suggests the Viceroys of Nanking and Wu Chang and
Earl Li. If these are appointed and China expresses a willingness to make full indemnity Japan
is ready to assist to the utmost.
JAPAN REFUSES TO BEGIN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.
The Shanghai correspondent of the Times, wiring August 24, says: "Li Hung Chang has
received a message from Peking that the Japanese alone will occupy the imperial palace. The
Japanese Government has renewed its assurance that it will protect the persons of the Emperor
end Empress Dowager."
At a conference of Ministers and generals held at Taku Friday it was decided, according
to the Daily Telegraph, to refer the date of the entry into the Forbidden City to Europe.
JAPANESE STILL GUARDING THE FORBIDDEN CITY.
LONDON. Aug. 27, 4:20 a. m. â Tientsin dispatches to Berlin, dated August 23, say: "The

City, but have not yet made their way to the imperial palace, owing to lack of Government in

LONDON, Aug. 27, 4 a. m. â The latest news from Peking is that the allies, when the last

Governments. An attack from 30,000 Boxers was anticipated, and to meet this the whole
American force and the British artillery, according to a dispatch to the Morning Post

phases of the existing trouble. The rumor
of a declaration of war by Russia, It Is
explained, may have grown out of the
operations of the troops of the Czar in
the protection of the southeastern fron
tier of his empire, or it may have arisen
from tho reported statement of the com
mander of the Russian forces at Peking
that his Government was at war with
China, and therefore he must prohibit
communication with the Chinese. Neither
the operations of Russia on her frontier
nor the prohibition by a Russian general
of communication with the Chinese would
constitute, it is said, a declaration of
war by Russia. No general . could de
clare war. Even his statement that his
Government had declared war would not
make it .so.
A declaration of war, it Is pointed out
by the best authority, is a perfectly dis
tinct and obvious proceeding. In this
country a declaration .of war may be
made only by Congress.
Among European nations the method
of procedure is simpler, but quite as ob
vious. War is declared by them by edict
or proclamation. It may be a declara
tion of war or it maye be the officia*
recognition that a state of war exists.
In either event the news of such action
would be published to the world imme
diately. Diplomatic | representatives . of
the power making the declaration would
be notified instantly In order that they
might communicate the information to
the governments of the country to which
they were accredited. The Information,
too, would be conveyed at once to the
nation against which the declaration was
.made. In turn this nation would Â¦ notify
its diplomatic representatives abroad
that they might govern themselves ac
cordingly. Within three hours after the

WASHINGTON*. Aug. 25.â A dis
patch was received to-day at the
Japanese legation from the For
eign Office of Japan, conveying
the latest and most authentic Information
of the situation In and around Peking. In
a measure the advices were of a dis
quieting nature, as they Indicated that
the Chinese had rallied their forces, and
were preparing for an attack upon the al
lies in Peking. If it should prove that the
allied forces were besieged in Peking it
would account for the lack of advices from
General Chaffee. As made public by
Minister Takahira, the dispatch from the
Japanese Foreign Ofiice at Tokio is as fol
lows:
"An official telegram, dated at Peking.
August 1?, -was received at Tokio from
General Yamaguchl, commander of the
Japanese forces, to the following effect:
" 'The capital is now entirely cleared of
the enemy. A cavalry regiment which
had been sent to Wanshaushan (where the
Empress Dowager's palace is located), re
ports that the imperial family, who had
left Peking on August 14, started, after a
short rest at Wanshaushan, for the west,
and were under escort of General Ma and
his troops, consisting of only about 500
horsemen and twenty cart^. The Japanese
forces occupied the Treasury Departmnt,
in which over 2,000.000 taels in silver and
a large quantity of rice were found.'
"Another telegraphic dispatch, dated
Taku. August 23. slates that as the Chi
nese troops and Boxers who had gathered
at Nanyuea were about to attack the for
eign forces at Peking. Japanese and Rus
sian cavalry were oxpected to encounter
them on the 20th. Tlie dispatch further
states that the Chinese infantry, some 'J000
strong, with 15 guns, are advancing for
ward from Shantung to make a rear at
tack on the allies." "
A copy of the dispatch was transmitted
to Acting Secretary Adee at the Depart
ment of State, and by him furnished to
the President. While the news of a pos
sible rear attack upon the comparatively
small force of the allies was not received
with surprise, it generally was not re
garded as serious, as the foreign fore Â»s
are believed to be abundantly able > to
take care of themselves* against any force
of Cblnese likely to be sent against them.

CHICAGO, Aug. 26.â Hon. Charles
Dcnby of Indiana, ex-United
States Minister to China j and
member of the first commission
to the Philippines, a . lifelong'
Democrat, has written a letter
urging the re-election of President Mc-
Kinley.
It is entitled "Bryan's Attitude Toward
the Philippines," and is made public by
the Republican National Committee. The
letter, in part, is as follows: "In his
speech of April 17, 1D00, in the Senate Mr.
Hoar said he could not forget that Mr.
Bryan, 'unless he is much misrepresented,
used all his power and influence with
those of his friends who were ready to
listen to his counsels, to secure the rati
fication of the treaty," meaning the Paris
treaty.
"There were seventeen Democratic Sen
ators who voted for the ratification. A
two-thirds majority was necessary. The
treaty was ratified by one vote.
"Mr. Bryan lias squarely assumed the
responsibility of the ratification. We had
taken Manila, on August 13, 180S. In De
cember, 1S9S, Spain hud made a treaty ced
ing the islands to us. We had occupied
them until February 5, 1S39. On that day
Aguinaldo made war on us, our soldiers
having to fight for their lives.
"The treaty was ratified on February
7, 1809. Mr. Bryan advised his friends
in the Senate to vote to ratify the treaty
after the battle of February 5 had been
fought. He knew that war had begun. He
might have readily foreseen what compli
cations might possibly occur out of the
existing conditions.
"Then was the time to have talked
about the 'consent of the governed,'
and not now, when every speech he
makes adds ten names to the roll of

dead.

himself advised.
"Mr. Bryan gives as his reason for ad

give independence to the Filipinos than to
trust to the accomplishment of that pur

under special charter to the
Alaska Exploration Company
this afternoon. Stowed away in
the big steamer's strong box is
a consignment of gold dust amounting to
$2,000,000. including Sl.000.000 of Xome eold.
The buiK of the Ohio's treasure is Klon

from Dawson on the river boat Leon. It
was over a month on the way. The Leon
did not make expected connections with
the Ohio at St. Michael, a fact which ac
counts for the Ohio's prolonged stay at
that port. The exact amount of the treas
ure brought down from Dawson on the
Leon is not known. The gold dust ship
ped through the exchange department of
the Alaska Exploration Company alone
amounted to $S30,000.

Strikes on the Bluestone.
The sensational reports of a big strike
In the Bluestone country are fully con
firmed by the reports of those who
reached here by the steamer from Port
Clarence. The Bluestone is a river empty
ing into Port Clarence and the discoveries
so far made are up near its headwaters.
Pans are reported to have been taken
out running from $2 SO to $12 each. These
prospects are taken out at less than eight
een inches below the surface, and old
prospectors say if the pay dirt extends to
bedrock, the Bluestone country will be a
*orld beater. No development work had
been done so far, but rockers are being
taken into the country as rapidly as pos
sible and there will soon be reports indi
cating how the diggings are to show up
as a permanent proposition. It is said to
be now almost impossible to reach the
new diggings by pack train, since the
ground is so soft that pack horses are
mired to their knees and traveling by foot
is difficult. In fact, the Bluestone is next
year's proposition and not much of an
output is expected there this season.
The first discovery was made on Gold
Run, left fork of the Bluestone. about ten
days ago. too late In the season to ren

Frost Settles on the Camp.
An apathy seems to have settled upon
the camp, and about the only places that
give any great impression of active Ufa
are the few fortunate saloons and gam

patrorage. The long: expected rain ha.=Â»
been falling for some days past, but it has
been productive of nothing but mud. The
gold which was expected to come in from
the creeks is all in the care of receivers
appointed by the court, and not a color of
it gets into circulation in the camp. The
feeling here is one of depression and un
certainty. A number of sood discoveries
have been reported, but as yet the only
evidence we ha've had of their riches is
the reports.
One of the hardest blows that has struck
the prosperity of the country has v come
from the litigation that has been started
here. I know of several cases where good
finds have been made and the holes filled
up and concealed. The discoverers would
not report their luck for fear they wpuld
be bunkoed out of it.
Several cases of pneumonia and typhoid

Whether, in the event of a declaration
of war by ore or more powers against
China. an invitation would be extended to
the United States to retire from China,
as Intimated In the dispatch from Chefu,
is open to doubt, and it is decidedly prob
lematic whether the Invitation would *e
accepted even if it were tendered. The
United States forces are in China pro
tecting the personal and property rights
of citizens of this country and, in addi
tion, the treaty rights of the United
States. Under the most favored nation
clause this country has certain specific
rights in China, and It Is said on author
ity to be the purpose of the United States
to protect and preserve these rights. The
attitude this Government would assume
in the event of a declaration of war by
another power would depend. It can be
stated upon immediate circumstances
eurrounding the declaration and the situ
ation.In China at the time the declaration
Â¦was made. In any event, it can be saJd
to be no part of the purpose of the United
States to sacrincÂ© any of Its guaranteed
rights or privileges In the Chinese
empire.
In carrying out her second object Rus
sia has seized Nincbawnff. This >as
done to obtain a base of operations from
which the frontier could easily be
reached, precisely as Taku was seized as
a base of operations by the allies in their
operations ajrainst Peking.
It Is pointed cut further that Russia
has two objects; !n her present operations
in Chinaâ the rescue and protection of
the foreign legationers c-id the protection
of Iht menaced frontier. The avowed ob
ject of the other power* lÂ« simply th*
rescue and protection' of the leg-atloners
and the other foreign subjects.
The nnderstandlns among Washington
ofSdalfl of Russia's jtetioii is that the
empire ha* declared fix- thr^e provinces
on its southeastern frontier in a state of
siego. Thi.s is altogether different from
a. declaration of mar. It corresponds to

, LINCOLN, Nebr., Aug. 26â Mr. Bryan
returned from Omaha this morning in
time to attend church. He had delivered
eleven addresses besides a number of
brief talks during the week, but did not
seem to regard the experience as in any
sense exceptional.
MADE EUSVEN SPEECHES.
Mr. Bryan has accepted invitations to
talk into graphophones, so that when he
is not present his admirers will be able to
listen to his eloquence by merely turning
the crank of an instrument. Had the
graphophone been used in the last cam
paign Mr. McKInley, as the Republican
candidate from civil life, might have been
willing to do as Mr. Bryan Is doing.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.â President Mc-
Kinley has decided that it would be un
d'gnlfled for the President to stump- tho
United States and appeal to the voters to
cast their ballots for his" re-election. He
has also determined that It would .be
highly improper for him to talk Into
graphophones or kindred instruments, and
has so advised prominent persons who
have been pressing him to do so.

I have no authority to make a forecast
nf the committee's action, but from what
I have heard, I am pretty certain that
the Populis-ts will be working with all
their energies for Bryan and Stevenson."
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2G. â In
discussing the speech which
Mr. Bryan delivered at Paw
nee, Xcbr., August 22. Secre
tary Gage to-day practically
accused the Democratic can
didate of uttering a deliber
ate untruth. In this speech Mr. Bryan
iÂ»ald: "They (Republicans) say they do
not believs in the ratio of 16 to 1. When
they make that assertion you ask them
why Mr. â¢ McKinley's administration is
coining silver dollars to-day at the ratio
of 10 to'l. In the month of March the
Republican administration coined 4,000,000
dollars at the ratio of 16 to 1, and yet Re
publicans think that the ratio of 16 to 1
is not right."
Secretary Gage was asked whether this
was a correct statement on the part of
Mr. Bryan. The Secretary replied:
"The statement is Bryanesque in form
and substance. It is the statement of a
truth so put as to lead his hearers to false
conclusions. To conceal part of the truth
In order to mislead is equivalent in all its
moral qualities to a deliberate untruth.
Only ignorance of suppressed truth can
absolve a man who so practices upon his
hearers from the charge of duplicity.
"While it is true that we were coining
silver dollars at the ratio of 16 to 1 every
working day in the year, we are coining
silver bullion of the Government for the
Government account, and not for the silver
owner and for his account. Mr. Bryan in
effect says: 'President McKinley's ad
ministration is coining silver dollars at
the ratio of 16 to 1.'
"This Is true; therefore, his premise is
correct. And having asserted something
"Friction is out of the question," he
said. "Everything will run so smoothly
that you would .not believe an important
political question was being passed on. ;
Chairman Butler arrived in Chicago to
day and found in waiting a number of his
fellow commltteemen. lie was in con
ference with his associates during the
greater part of the evening- The friends
of Mr. Stevenson, it is understood,
brought every argument to bear on the
Senator in favor nf a speedy and decisive
meeting. While Senator Butler would not
discuss the meeting, Eugene Smith,, sec
retary of the conference committee and
the official in charge or the Chicago head
quarters, was not so reticent.
â¢ CHICAGO, Aug. 2G.â Unless the unex
pected happens, Adlal E. Stevenson to
morrow will be substituted for Charles A.
Towne. as the Vice Presidential nominee
on the Populist ticket. A poll of the
National Committee of that "party was
taken to-night and. the Illinois man was
seemingly assured a comfortable majori
ty. The Populists who are advocating
unity with the Democrats predict that the
selection of Mr. Stevenson to be Mr. Bry
an's running mate on both tickets will
be unanimous, though Senator Marion
Butler, chairman of the committee, and
several others have declared themselves
as unalterably opposed to such action.

will proceed unless the committee are bigger
cowards than I think they are. It would be
ridiculous Tor the majority to surrender to a
minority. Ours is the regular ticket and if

THE SENTENCE OF LYMCHERS
OUT of Texas comes one of the most cheering
reports that has come out of the South for a
long time. It is the announcement that a
number of men engaged in lynching have been con
victed of the crime and sentenced to life imprison
ment. It thus appears that there is a revolt in the
South itself against the barbarities that have been
committed in that section under the name of lynch
law, 'and that at last an earnest effort is to be made
to bring the offenders to answer for their violence be
fore the bar of justice.
> One swallow does not make a spring, nor does one
conviction for lynching clear up the dreary situation
in the South. It Ts only a sign of the' coming of bettei
things. It may be a long time before another occurs.
Nevertheless, the' country will be gratified even with
this one sign. The record of Southern lynchings his
been so hideous and every effort to bring the lynchers
to justice has been so feeble and so futile that it seems
almost like the dawn of a new, era to learn that the
law has at last taken hold of some of the bold of
fenders and sentenced them to an imprisonment
which will prevent them from doing further harm.
Kow that the first, step in the direction of reform
in the matter has been taken it is to be hoped the
supporters of law and justice in all parts of the South
will take courage and be more resolute than ever in
their fight against a barbarism that has threatened
the very foundations of Southern society. The lynch
ers have been bold only because the better and

If the soldiers who made a dastardly attack upon

M. F. Taylor, the Democratic orator, holds out to

Commissioner Maguirc of the Board of Public

If the Board of Education were as successful in

PERSONAL MENTION?
Two armored cruisers "of 12,416 tons are
to be laid down at Cherbourg and Brest.
The British torpedo-gunboat Niger is to
have new engines and boilers. Sho wag
launched in 1S92 and made her steam trials
in the following year. Kleven boats of
that type and size were built at one time,
and were expected to develop 4500 horse
power and 21 knots. Only one c,i the lot
the Speedy, built by Thomycroft, ex
ceeded-the horsepower by 203. but gave
only 20 knots epeed.. The average of the
others was only. 3C00 horsepower and 13
knots speed.. They have, of course,, not
improved with age. Their sea speed is
about 16 knots. The fault lies with the
engines and boilers, as the dimensions and
lines of, the hull are such as to warrant
21 knots speed. â¢ .. ani
Knas Potemkln Tavritchesky la the
euphonious name . of a battle-ship being
constructed at. Nicolaleff, of 10,400 tons
and 10,600 horsepower, to steam 16 knots.
The vessel is nearly ready for launching.
Another battle-ship, named Knas Suva
roff. is to be begun shortly at the Baltic
works, St. Petersburg. She will be of
the .Tsarevltch type, but larger.' of 13,600
tons and lfi,C00 horsepower. Others of
the same size in course of construction
are the Borodino. Orel and Alexander
III. Their armor belt extends clear fore
and aft and is of 10-inch Harvey stepl.
The batteries are four 12-inch, twelve 6
inch and twenty 3-inch guns.
The Russian Admiralty will establish
training colleges at some ports for the ed
ucation of marine engineers and naval
architects. They will also get the benefit
from actual working in the navy-yards.
The United States -navy Is the only one
in which graduates from the .naval acad
emy are made assistant naval construct
ors after a couple of years' supplemental
theoretical education in England and
France. Their practical apprenticeship
begins with their commission as officers
in charge of work at navy-yards or as
Government inspectors at private yards.
An interesting trial took place recently
in the Mediterranean, when four ships of
the British sQuadron were ordered to
steam under four-fifths power from a
point six miles east of Gibraltar to an
other point six miles north of Cape Fi
gan, Spain. The distance was 7SS miles,
which the new battle-ship Ocean covered
in 46 hours and 54 minutes, an average of
16.8 knots, consuming 520 tons of coal.
The battlo-ship Renown, four years old,
averaged 16 knots,- and the Isis and Dido,
cruisers of 5600 tons, 16.7 and 16.25 knots
respectively.
There are some French naval experts
v/ho do not approve of huge battle-ships,
and claim that> it would be better to
build vessels of 6000 to 8000 tons to have
all the" defensive powers of the present
15,C00-ton ship, but with less speed. M.
Normand points further to the fact that
the phenomenal speed of 23 knots de
manded from some cruisers is not car
ried knit in practice, and that such a
sprcd dwindles down to 18 or 19 knots at
sea.
The Austrian coast-defense ship Haps
burg is to be launched at Trieste Septem
ber 9. She is one of three of a new type.
333 feet length, 65 feet beam and 23 feet
draught, with a displacement of 8310 tons.
The speed is to be IS knots, and the armor
belt is 8 feet in height and 8.7 inches max
imum thickness. The battery is compos
ed of three 10.6-Ineh Krupp. twelve 5.9
inch quick firers and two 2.75-inch rapid
fire guns.
The Marseillaise, of 10,014 tons, was
built at a French dockyard, and launched
six months after the keel was laid, and
the Suffren was six and a half months in
the stocks. There .has been a remarkable
improvement in French dockyard meth
ods of recent years, and ships no longer
remain years on the stocks.
The French gunboat Zelee, built at
Rochefort. made 13.5 knots during her re
cent six hours' trial under full power.
A sister vessel, the Decidee, is now on its
way to the Orient.
Austria's naval budget for 1900 foots up
to $S.222,100, a large increase over las.t
year's expenditure.
THE WORLD'S WARSHIPS
They are 4"> feet In length. 6D feet beam;
triple-screw englr.es of 24,000 horsepower,
to give a speed of 21 knots, and coal stow
age for 19G0 tons, sufficient for 10,000
miles at 10 knots. The cost of each ves
sel complete with armament is estimated
at 15,796,500, and they will carry 23 offi
cers and a crew of 6S7. They have been
named Jules Ferry and Leon Gambetta.
and are to be completed early in 1303 and
during the middle of" 1004, in the order
named. Th<* batteries are proportionate
to the size and general object of these
ships, and comprise four 7.6-inch, sixteen
6.4-inch, twenty 3-pounders and four
l'.-2-pounders. besides five torpedo dis
charges. All the guns are quick firers.
Wail street is dull and featureless and the public
is entirely out of the market. The professionals are
also and arc waiting for something to turn
up. The London market is also dull. The Bank of
Kng.rr.d's reserve has recently been greatly strength
ened by '.he receipt of the United States' subscription
to the war loan, amounting to over $.20,000,000 in go!.i
coin, and this has cased the London money market
to 5uch an extent that further withdrawals of gold
from tJ:is country arc no longer apprehended. Easy
money, however, has little perceptible effect on the
market? either of London or New York. There is no
speculation in the air.
local trade is good. There are no complaints
worthy of note, and the export business of the port
keeps up without a break. Farm products as a rule
arc i'rirging good prices, and'the State at large is
riiarina: in the benefits thereof. Canned and dried
fruits rre very firm, with a smaller output of both
than expected earlier in the season, and the tendency
jn prices is upward. Grapes are opening at first rate
prices- with a fair but not large crop. Many products
arc waiting the outcome in China. If hostilities there
arc prolonged and large bodies troops are main
tained in the Orient a number of farm products will
surely feel the effects of it in higher prices before long."
The situation both in merchandise and farm produce
is decidedly bullish, and it would' not take much
ir-crcase in the demand to send prices still higher.
1 here was a slow rise in wheat during: the week,
except at the close. The general grain market in
S:'n Francisco is firm: barley on account of a reduced
crop, oats on account of the Government demand
r.nd corn on account of light supplies. ' The cereal
msrket as a whole has improved considerably during
tlie summer months and is now in good shape for
formers and local sellers. Cotton has weakened off
under needed rr.ins in the Southern States. Pro
visions arc firm but quiet, and there is little talk of
tutting 2raong the local trade.
The staples are exhibiting more fluctuation. More
fineness in hides and leather is noted, foreign quota
tions being stronger, and the markets at Chicago
and Sar> Francisco are quoted in better condition.'
T-ut the boot and shoe trade still languishes; fac
lories in the East are working only part of the time,
cod it now appears that there is more stock on hand
than estimated some time ago. Wool continues firm,
and sales have lately made a material increase. Confi
dence in the future is shown by Western dealers, who
are shipping East with instructions to their consignees
to hold the goods until after the election. This, in itself
is a pretty good Republican campaign straw, its very
inrteness rendering it eloquent. The iron trade con
tinues unsettled. Reports of price reductions here
Lr.d there are offset by reports of a marked increase in
the demand at other points. Furnace production has
been rapidly decreased of late, and will be kept up
until the demand and supply get closer together.
That tinie may not be distant, for an English inquiry
:> now reported, consequent upon the reduced quo
tations. Tin and copper are both lower, the latter
owing to larger stocks.
TRADE reports from different parts of the coun
try show considerable irregularity. The bank
clearings still run along remarkably even, the
decrease last week being 17; i per cent, against an
average of about lty 2 per cent for the past few weeks.
Thus, as far as these ba.nk clearings are an indication,
our ratio to last year in the volume of business is un
dergoing no change. We are just so far behind 1899,
and are staying there, neither gaining nor losing.
The failures, however, are making a better showing,
these last week being 155, against 154 for the cor
ic?j>onding week in 1899.
TRADE IRREGULAR BUT BUOYANT.
Even if the end be at hand, Dewet will be remem
bered as one of the ablest leaders of mounted in
fantry that ever sat a saddle and fought against odds
of ten to one. He may not win the independence of
his country, but he has proven the ability of his
countrymen to fight for it like men, and attested his
own right to rank among the foremost patriot leaders
of all lime. .
On Saturday dispatches from Roberts stated that
Dewet has buried all his cannon; that his army has
been broken up into small bands and the force with
him is now not more than 300 men. Pole-Carew and
French and all the rest are now scampering after the
scattered bands. Perhaps they will catch some of
them, but the chances are we shall hear ere long that
most of them have succeeded in making their way to
some point agreed upon and have there united for fur*
thcr fighting.
When the British are looking for him in one place
he bobs up serenely somewhere else. He has marched
over a wide region of country, but he never seems
to be tired. He is a strategist, a tactician and a
fighter, and in each of those departments of a gen
eral's activity he shines with no mean' light. Withal
he is a merry warrior and delights in a little joke.
Not long ago, when Dewet was supposed to be far
away and Buller was straining himself to head him
off from wherever he was going, he suddenly appeared
in. Front of Baden-Powell's force and sent to that hero
a white flag, demanding his surrender. The Britisher
saw the joke and humored it by politely asking in re
turn what terms would be granted him. Then before
the Mafeking hero could get ready to strike Dcwct
was Â£one.
For weeks General Dewet has been hunted by
three armies â one under Kitchener, one under Hunter
and one under Baden-Powell. These have been
served by suc^i subordinate commanders as French,
Hamilton, Mcthuen and Smith-Dorian. Over all has
been Field Marshal Lord Roberts. It was stated that
when the hunt began Dewet had under his command
about 7000 men. How many have been on his trail
from first to last has not been stated, but it has hardly
been less than 80,000. Nearly every active troop in
the British service has had a whack at him at one
time or another. He has been surrounded more
times than there are letters in his name. He has had
foes to the right of him, foes to the left of him, foes
in front of him and foes behind him; but he has never
yet been cornered where he could be held, nor has
he ever struck the surrounding lines without succeed
ing in breaking through.
WHEN the full story of the war in South Africa
comes to be written the chapter which nar
rates the marching and the fighting of Dewet
since the fall of Pretoria will be one of the most thrill
ing romances in history. Even in the brief dis
patches coming in one at a time from the seat of
war the record shows brilliantly. What Dewet has
been doing, and is doing still, is far superior to any
thing White did at Ladysmith, or Baden-Powell in
defense of Mafeking. In fact, he is accomplishing one
of the most remarkable feats in the annals of war.
GENERAL DEWET'S ESCAPE.
Such a treaty might combine the physical strength
of the two empires for offense and defense, put the
vast military strength of China under expert Russian
training, equip the eighty millions of Chinese of fight
ing age and strength with modern artillery and simll
arms and enable the combined Muscovite and Mongol
to defy the world. The reach of such a policy is so
dazzling in its possibilities as to stimulate the astute
statesmanship of Russia. With such an ally "Adam
Zad the bear" would be the dictator of the destinies
of the world, as far as the awe of a vast military force
can influence them. No wonder the cabinets o?
Europe are disturbed by the prospect.
There have been suspicions of a secret understand
ing between her arid the Chinese Government. This
declaration that war exists between the two empires
might â¢ be in line with such an understanding. If
Russia claims a state of war the allies can neither aid
her nor China and tha two would be left free to con
clude a peace by a treaty that would give to Russia,
as a belligerent, exclusive advantages of the most im
portant nature.
This would install a very startling situation. It
would place the allies in the position of helping Rus
sia take the city as a power at public war with China
and wouldjywe think, give the nations they represent
the same status as Russia. Of course, this is insuffer
able. The United States, France, Japan, Germany
and England were in arms on Chinese soil only to
protect the interests of their citizens or subjects ami
to rescue their diplomatic representatives besieged by
riotous revolutionists, with whom the Government
professed to be unable to cope. The duty of those
nations was clear and they discharged it with ardor
and success. Russia did not proclaim any other pur
pose and her presence with the allies committed her
to the same policy which made their presence neces
sary. â¢ â¢
AN unconfirmed report is to the effect that, after
entering Peking with the allies, the Russian
commander refused to desist from such further
acts of war as the destruction of the royal palace and
Government propery, giving as his reason that his
Government had declared war on China.

pUjOUR years ago Bryan was going up and down
I the country predicting all sorts of dire disasters
to the country and the people should gold be
established as the standard of value. He said such a
policy would make times harder; that every one would
suffer except money owners and money changers;
that the hope of the toiling masses would be de
stroyed; that the opportunity for work would be
diminished; that the savings of the thrifty would de
crease; that the ability of savings banks to collect
their assets would be lessened, and that depositors
in the savings banks would have to withdraw their
deposits to pay living expenses.
To refute those predictions the Republican party
need prepare no campaign document. The reports
of bank officials afford all the evidence that is needed
on the subject. Take San Francisco as an example
of the country at large. The reports of the nine sav
ings banks in this city to the State Board of Bank
Commissioners show that on July 31 of last year there
was due depositors the total sum of $113,294,21399.
A week ago a call was made by the Bank Commis
sioners for statements of business at the close of busi
ness hours on August ill In response the returns
show that there. is due depositors the surprisingly
large sum of $120,480,827 70, or an increase in deposits
of $7,186,713 71 in a little over twelve months.
, It is to be borne in mind that the depositors in sav
ings banks arc mainly workingmen and working
women â persons in moderate circumstances and liv
ing on wages or salaries. The capitalists and the busi
ness men of the community carry their deposits al
most exclusively in the commercial banks. Thus this
large increase in the savings banks deposits repre
sents the gain that has come in a single year to the
wage-earners of the city. It is a showing that car
ries- unanswerable proof that the gold standard and
the protective tariff have fulfilled, in this city at any
rate, all that their advocates promised, and its refuta
tion of the predictions of Bryan is complete.

Tlfe prospect is favorable for a good convention,
controlled by men wno do not wear the railroad col
lar nor exhale the odor of Mint saloon influences.
An honest convention will give the party a ticket
that will command the votes not only of Republicans
but of independent citizens. That will mean victory.
Everything rests with the Committee of Eighteen.
The members of that body are charged with a serious
responsibility. Upon their firmness the success of
the party in this city is dependent. Should they
stand unswervingly by the principles they have laid
down all will be well, and they will have rendered to
San Francisco Republicanism a service which will
not be forgotten.
In the meantime, honest Republicans wait with ex
pectation of good results upon the action of the Com
mittee of Eighteen. Assurances have been given that
a fair investigation will be made, that no snap judg
ment will be taken upon any contested point and that
every protest sustained by written affidavits will be
fairly and fully considered. That is all the honest
Republicans of the city ask for. Herrin and Crim
mins and Kelly virtually admitted their inability to
get a majority of the honest votes of the party when
they resorted to the tactics that distinguished them
at the primaries. A full investigation will prove that
the victor)' of the better elements of the party has
been confused only by cheating, repeating, stuffing
and ballot-box smashing. The bosses who instigated
such offenses should not be permitted to profit by
them.
What has taken place both in the Republican and
in the Democratic primaries in this city is convincing
proof of the need of a primary law, and decent men
of all parties should unite to bring about the enact
ment of one at the coming session of the Legisla
ture. That much should be registered in the public
mind now. Under such conditions as prevail there
must be some safeguard for the rights of honest men
at primary elections, and such safeguards can be given
only Iry law. Â«
"Hie FIGHT AGAINST FRAUD.
t â
BAD as is the confusion which the combined
bosses succeeded in bringing about at the Re
publican primaries, there are good reasons for
expecting that order and justice will be brought out
of it by the firm action of the Committee of Eighteen
appointed by the County Committee to act as a re
turning board and eliminate fraud from the returns
wherever fraud can be proven.
stronger elements of people of the South have, for
one reason or another, tolerated their crimes. If now
the punishment of lynchers in Texas means that these
elements are going to stand for justice hereafter, the
worst of the barbaric lynching that, has shocked the
nation may be over. At any rate the country will
hope so, and draw the best auguries from the action
of the people and the courts in Texas. Â¦

Monday was a gala night at the Colum
bia Theater, and surely Henry Miller in
all his triumphant tour as Sidney Carl
ton never faced a more brilliant or better
dressed audience. I thought that Mrs.
Joe Tobin was the best dressed woman
in the house. Those who did not agree
with me admitted readily enough, how
ever, that she certainly was the most at
tractive. She had on a gorgeoous pink
gown of some soft clinging flimsy ma
terial, and I'd be afraid to say how very
many yards the finely accordion pleated
skirt must have consumed. .The bolero
and tabs of ecru lace gave a decided In
dividuality to the gown, and the black
velvet hat with long drooping plumes
that Mrs. Tobln wore with the dress just
lent the right picturesque touch to a
"smashing" ensemble.
Miss Agnes Tobin, who was also In the
Tobin box; had on a particularly Frenchy
pale blue with pink roses.

. - /1TH somewhat the same sensation of unpardonable enjoyment that the
III small boy feels when, a wasp approaches the minister's nose during a
III lon^ sermon on a hot summer's day, the unrcgenerate opera-goer wel-
comes those occasional Intermezzos that relieve the deadly seriousness
of that most glaringly serious of all serious things â grand opera, as It
Is known to-day.
In the short season that has run so far at the Tivoll Incidents innumerable
"not on the programme," comic, pathetic and otherwise, have delighted the
said unregenerate person Â¦with the opera habit. little lapses Into dally life
have shocked the artificial dwellers of opcraland Into a grateful momentary
reality, by contrast irresistibly comic; the always happening unexpected has
happened with unfailing unexpectancy: and it has been a cold night when
some unrehearsed diversion could not be counted upon for welcome distrac
tion from the merry footlightera at the Tivoli.
Russo, the little master of the mezzo voce, Is one of the greatest sinnersâ
or saviors, as one regards itâ In this connection. Who among those who heard
It will forget the grateful relief from the hysteric strain of the last act of
"Rlgoletto" afTorded by the amusing interpolation of the Duke of Mantua, as
edited by Signnr Russo?
At an "inn in a desert spot, near the banks of the river Minclo." the Duke
of Mantua, obligingly enticed by the brigand's sister. Maddalena. to his
death at the hands of Rlgoletto, sings in the meantime with the lady the
charming duct "Donna e Mobile."
To distinguish the couple from the would-be duklcide. Rigoletto. and his
Injured daughter, who are outside of the Inn, the limelight is thrown on the
Duke and his Maddalena. Slgnor Russo, modestly objecting to the glare of
publicity, like a modern Joshua, commanded the mimic sun to take itself off.
with all the vivid effectiveness of gesture natural' to the Italian among peo
ples. The man at the meter, with the readiness at "gag" common among tho
Tlvolians, compiled, with .the' unexpected request and the crowd scttlod down
to the menu of murder to follow. But It was not so to be, without a still
more amazing Interruption, for Slgnor Russo. slightly Intoxicated with his
triumph over the lime-light man. and a little dangerous knowledge of Eng
lish, called down to Maddalena in a mellifluous tenor voice from the upstairs
room of thp inn. into which he had retired for safetyâ "I will leave my home
happy for you-oo-oo-oo!"
The little tenor was also the hero of the comic opera conflagration that
took place at th? Tivoli on the first night of "MIgnon" this last week. At
the end of the second act the new and handsome tapestry curtain, lent to
the management for the season by Henry Miller, caught the footlights and
two slim tongues of fire leaped to the flies. The stape {revelers rushc<i for
ward to reassure the audience, and Russo. who as AVilhclm Meistcr had just
been fencing with Frederick, sprang at the flames with his foils, and the
rather alarming incident ended In a gale of laughter and thunders of ap
plause for the plucky little Don Quixote.
As regards Russo's knowledge. of English, a pretty story is told. Signora
Russo Is a sweet and pretty American girl, and last year there was no Signora
Russo. As Slgnor Russo speaks very little English and the Signora less
Italian, a curious friend Inquired how they had made love under the clr
cumstances." "Love no language needs," the gallant littler tenor replied,
hand on heart. %'/--.
When the shell couch of \ enus upset last Wednesday evening, turning a
double somersault in the Bacchanalian revels of the first act of "Tann
hauser" It was not to be attributed to an excess of imaginative faculty on
the. stage manager's part, but to another of those intermezzos for which the
Wagnerlan music-drama offers such an Irresistibly tempting foil.
And when the young shepherd, piping away upon the rocks, by grace of
Mr. Newbauer In the orchestra below, forgot to pipe wh,en pipe he should, the
whole irresponsible attention of the delighted audience was directed to the
expected next break In thÂ« connection. Shades of Wngncr!
But there is another side. Those who heard the brilliant mad scene of Re
petto's Lucia will hardly believe that after It the" singer was received fainting
into the arms of those who stood behind the wings. And those who were dis
appointed in the Tannhauser of Avedano on Wednesday evening will not
think his defection so strange when they learn that he had just received the
news of a beloved father's death before going on to sing. He will again sing
his part to-morrow evening, and it la sometimes well to remember that every
thing Is "not onthe programme."

The Building Trades Council and the
Millmf-n's Union have both ignored the
resolution passed by the Builders' Ex
change which condemned the interference
of the council in the contest between the
mlllmen and the millowners. No official
notice of the lesolutlon has been taken
by either organization. '; '.' â¢
The leaders of the union say that the
consideration of the subject by the Build
ers' Exchange was entirely gratuitous.
Somo of the millowncrs are members of
the exchange, which pretended to act as
a disinterested party, seeking the best In
terests of the city.
While the millowners are holding out
with apparently no signs cf weakening,
the mlllmen are cheerful and confident of
speedy victory. Not a single man among
the strikers has applied for the strike ben
efit of $G per week, to which they have
all been entitled since tfie end of the first
week of the strike, a fact which shows
how well able the men were to enter upon
a period of enforced Idleness.
"The result of this contest will be," a
member of the Building Trades Council
said last evening, '"that many of the small
mills will be forced out of business. That
is what the large mills are playing them
for. Tho small fellows, with high rents
and heavy mortgages, cannot stand the
strain very long. Hoopor, Crooker. Han
sen, Young. Kendall. NIehaus
and others of the big millowncrs will keen
them in tho association up to the point
where they will have to dispose of their
mills. After that elimination Is accom
plished the big owners will yield grace
fully to our demands tar an eight-houi
riay. with the provision that we protÂ«vt
them apalnst the competition of outside
mills. Then they will havn the trade 01
the city right In their hands and will be
able to maintain a combination to rcsu
late prices."
The millmon point out two possible
means that may be employed by them If
the contest drans along and becomes a.
fight to th.fi <leath. One is to start a mill,
to be managed nnd manned by their own
men. Th;it could bf> done by a small out
lay of capital, as there are several plan
ing mill plants that could be secured by
them by )t:sise. One enterprising; millman
has solved the problem for himself by se
curing a ''sticker" and going to work for
himself. He has more orders than he can
till and will probably soon become an em
ployer himself.
The other means referred to is an np
peal to the American Federation of Labor
to secure the ro-operation of the kindrea
organizations In Australia and other for
eign countries to which mill work isÂ»
shipped from San Francisco. If that were
done the building trades unions there
would refuse to handle mill work sent
from the San Francisco mills until the
contest here Is settled. The local organi
zations do not expect to have to resurt to
such extreme measures, however, and
they are only mentioned by the working
men as possibilities.

ference by Interested
A serious affair at the Presidio yester
day v.as only prevented by the sol
diers' enforced habit of obeying: their
officers. A game of baseball between
a team put forward by a bitters
company and men from the Fifth
Infantry was wound up in tho fifth
inning by one of the soldiers striking an
outsider r.amed Samuels, who had vol
unteered his opinion as to the justness
of a decisio'n rendered by the umpire. The
decision was in favor of the civilian team
and th'at. coupled with the fact that the
soldiers happened to be on the losing end,
was more than the boys in blue could
stand. The catcher of tho soldiers' nine
lf-t fly his husky right and connected
with the Jaw of Samuels. In a moment
the field was a mass of struggling sol
diers and civilians. The rest ot the visit
ing: team stayed by their champion man
ufully. but they were overpowered in the
twinkling- of an eye and were being very
roughly handled when two lieutenants
appeared on the scene.
An order issued by the officers quelled
the disturbance immediately. Samuels
was escorted from the grounds and the
soldiers ordered to their quarters. The
game, however , was indefinitely post
poned, as it was thought unsafe to allow
the teams to tini.sh. Several black eyes
and a great number of bruises were the
results of the melee.
The Secretary of War has issued an
order directing that all troops under
orders for China be paid for one month
in advance. This applies to the men
leaving up to October 1.
Steward Mutton, who hns been con
nected with the general hospital at the
Presidio since its completion, has been
detached from there and will go to the
Philippines on the Rcsecrans. The stew

An army captain, whose name the po
lice refuse to divulge, has been missing
from his post since Friday and an ener
petic search If "ocing made for him. He
left the Presidio in citizen's clothes and
in a ?obcr condition. His wife remains
at the post, but Fince his sudden depart
ure nothing has been heard from him.
Laet evening Lieutenant Davis of the
miffing man's company with another
army officer applied to the police for as-
Eistaace In searching the tenderloin dis
trict for their superior officer. They
Etated that he had discarded his uniform
<n Friday and came to this city. He was
sohfT at the time. His wife has had us
word from him since.
The Morgue records were searched, as
it iv:Â»s furmised that the man might havÂ«
taken his own life, but the bony of no
unknown man had been received at
That institution within the last two days.
The search made by the police lasted
â¢until an early hour tnis morning, but so
far as known nothing developed from It.
The police refuse to give out the cap
tain's name. , 'Â¦
From what the missing- man s brother

CHARACTERS OF THE OPERA
ARE BUT HUMAN AFTER ALL
THE stage has claimed another society favorite, but It Is a man this time.
Oscar Franck, popular In local society circles, and whose splendid barytone
voice has been heard at all the swell club jinks and entertainments for the
last few years, is about to make a professional debut. After refusing
manv offers to go on the stage, he has finally been induced to' take the Im
portant step. He has been engaged to support Ferris Hartman In the coming
elaborate production of "Ship Ahoy," making a professional appearance at the
Alhambra on September 6.
Franck possesses a sweet barytone voice, which together with his easy stage
presence, should win him as many honors In the professional arena as It has
at the many society and club functions he has attended in this city. As Toddles
In "Ship Ahoy" he Is afforded splendid opportunities for showing off his clev
erness. Franck has a very large following in this city and his friends are plan
ning a big reception for him on the opening night.

"Quito is a city of SO.O00 inhabitant?,
with fifty Catholic churches. In that pop
ulation there are fifty people who can
speak English sufficiently to be under

three American missionaries went to

nearly lost their lives. However, they
stuck to their chosen task, and are now
In the country under the protection of the
government. At the present time there is
not a Protestant church in the city, and
It will be a long time before one Is es
tablished. My wife came out with me

General Sampson Sees Business for Cali
fornia in the Pending Treaty.
GENERAL ARCHIBALD J. SAMP-;
SON. Minister Plenipotentiary and I
Envoy Extraordinary to the Re- I
public cf Ecuador, arrived here
yesterday on the German steamer Tanis
ft the Cosmos line, and is domiciled with
friends. The high official is- direct from
the capital of Ecuador and is quite en
thused over the prospects of largely in
creasing trade with the people of the
southern republics.
General Sampson states that before he
left Quito he completed the negotiation
Ol a reciprocity treaty with the Govern
ment of Ecuador which will be of especial
benefit to California. This treaty is now
lc f. cre !, he Congress of that country and
will undoubtedly be ratified.
It appears that the export of flour and
vrjne will bÂ«? especially fostered under the

the fact that all supplies have to be pack-
T - he cSty of Wuito over a aifficult
irau zu miles up into the Andi-F, to an
PjMtude of 10.000 foet. There is great
for the development of a large
t-xport trade from this port to that coun
try. t>ea transportation is now available
and wnl Improve in quality and price,
and a railroad is now in course of con
struction from Â«iuavaquil to Quito, at a
coft of J17.5yJ.000. 1 ais capital Is being
supplied by American and Knclish capi
talists who think they see great profits
in the investment. The line has been con-
Ftructed for sixty miles and it is expect
ed that the work will be completed In two
>Â«*ars. The construction is in charge of
Archer Harmon, an American, represent
:-e New York capital.
"Â¦Tne experience of Ecuador," said the
eminent gentleman, speaking of the Pres
idential election in this country, "is quite
interesting in connection with the silver
c;'.ie?tion. The silver basis has been given
a lonjc and thorough trial and was found
wanting, and tho country has now defi
nitely determined to go to the gold stand
ard in November next. President Alfaro
confidently looks for highly beneficial re-
Fults from the chance, notwithstanding
its radical nature. I have no doubt that
peneral prosperity will follow as soon as
tne country shall have adjusted itself to
the now conditions.
"Ecuador is marvelously rich, not only
!n her natural but in cultivated products,
produces two-thirds of the cocoa of
the world, and her products include rub
ber, supax. tobacco, ivory, nuts and fruits
of the temperate and tropic zones in the
greatest profusion. "When it comes to
mineral*-'. thÂ«* country Is rich both in gold
and silver. There is certainly a fine field
for American capital In. that region. If it
Is properly directed. The advent of the
Impressive were the ceremonies inci
dental to the rededication of the Temple
Beth Israel en Geary street, celebrated
yesterday afternoon.
To the crowd that filled every available
inch of room in the sacred edifice several
changes were apparent in mural decora
tions and interior arrangement. The
fine organ has been removed from
the north end to the south end
of the building and now occupies
a ugsition above the sacred ark. A
great improvement in the acoustics of the
building has been effected by this arrange
ment. The new fresco work called forth
much admiration from the congregation.
It is by the well-known artist, M. J. Lyon.
The rinest individual piece of work Is a
representation of. the Ark of Testimony,
which is placed at the end of the southern
aisle.
The seating capacity of the building has
also been enlarged, the auditorium now
affording accommodation for 3oO more per
sons than formerly. Four capacious new
schoolrooms have been added in the base
ment. -\ /
At 2:30 o'clock the services were opened
by the ceremony or' the unbarring of the
Eate. Rabbi Levy of tne Congregation
lieth Israel, alter knocking twice uii the
main entrance, chanted in ueurew tne
words, "open Unto Me the Gates of
Righteousness," to which the cantor and
choir replied, "This Is the Gate of the
Lord, Let the Righteous Knter."
The door was then opened and a pro
cession formed by the rabbis in tun can
onicals. The lead was taken by a choir
of twenty little girls from the confirma
tion class of l'JOO. 1 hen came Rabbis M.
S. Levy, Jacob _ Voorsanger, J. Nieto,
Jbidore Myers, M. Friedlunacr and Cantor
J. Rabinovritz. The rear post of honor was
composed of S. Mayerson, acting presi
dent in place of M. iierzog, who is in Eu
rope, and H. Levy, acting vice president.
The choir, composed of Miss Grace Da
vis, Miss Alma lierglund and Miss L.
KoÂ«?der, sopranos; Miss Kdith Hanks and
Mrs. II. Friedberg. contraltos; J. F- Ve
aco and D. Lawrence, tenors; J. C.
Hughes and S. J. Sandy, bassos; Dr.
Franklin Palmer, organist, rendered fine
selections. The Rev. Mr. Voorsanger then
addressed the congregation. He congratu
lated them on the improvements they had
wrought in their place of worship. The
labbi also pleaded tor the strict observ
ance of orthodox Judaism combined with
the advancing spirit of the times. Such, a
combination, he said, could not but result
in Just such a work as they had assembled
to view and dedicate.
The Rev. M. S. Levy also delivered a
short address paying a graceful compli
ment to those who had been instrumental
in accomplishing the work. He said:
"To those who have so faithfully and
zealously worked on the various commit
tees to whose efforts this congregation is
earnestly Indebted, I must tender my
htarty and heartfelt thanks. As I look
at the brethren assembled here I feel that
your prayers must go up to-day, as do
mine, to make this place of worship the
abode, the lasting abode, of orthodox Ju
daism, the Judaism which has been the
backbone of our race through countless
PgPS."
The services closed with .1 benediction
by the Rev. Dr. M. Friedlandcr.

The frofh notoriety attached to Abbott's

Sir Pasha, the Favorite, Gets a Bad
Fall in the Final, Losing
the Course.
! Curtis & Sons' Narcissus certainly
played in good luck in winning the de
ciding course in the open stake yesterday
at Union Park. As good as 2 to 1 could
be had against the winner, and the odds
quoted were fair enough. From the slips
Sir Pasha showed that the talent usea
good judgment In making him a favorite.
He showed the speed over his opponent
and led a good two lengths, and at that
1 was not extending himself.
As the hounds neared the hare Sir Pasha
could be seen steading himself for the
turn. Suddenly he fell. It was no easy
affalr either, but Sir Pasha was game and
was soon In the chase. Then in a hard
course ho started to regain the winning
position, but it was too late. Without
doubt Narcissus could not have reached
better than second place against Mc-
Comb's fast black one if the accident had
i not given him the one chance when It
! looked like a forlorn hope.
Whitehead was expected to reach well
down In the finals and had many followers
who favored his chances for the stake, but
he was put out of the running in the sec
ond round by Connell Brothers' St. Helen
In a short course. St. Helen scored for
speed and two turns and the favored one,
with no points, ruined his chances by
making the kill too soon.
A good play was made on the Lopez
hound, the talent giving 4 to. 1 on his
chances.
Royal Flush was another favorite that
failed to connect. In the third round the
many-times stake winner went out to
Snapper Garrison, a 4 to 1 short end.
Flush has gone back, and it is not likely
that many future stakes will go to him.
Rural Artist was in fine trim to reach
the bottom of the caru. but a gruelling
course all over the field with Silver Cloud
was ton strong a handicap, and he went
out to Anchor in the fourth.
Lexington beat Best Bargain In the
second round at odds of 5 to 1. Consider
ing recent work it was a false price.
The coursing throughout the day was
good. Favorites were beaten in eleven in
stances.
The day's results, with Judge John
Grace's official scores, follow:
Open stake, second round â J. Mortarlty's
Snapjjer CJarrison beat J. H. Perigo's Controller.

NARCISSUS WINS OPEN
STAKE AT UNION PARK
THE Corinthian annual clambake at
the Tiburon clubhouse Is always a
jovial affair, but it was doubly so
yesterday because It was made the
occasion of receiving the Perpetual chal
lenge cup, won last month by the sloop
Aeolus Quite a squadron of San Fran
cisco Club yachts cruised over from Sau-
Ealito to Tlliuron, Commodore W. N. Mc-
Carthy's schooner Ramona being accom
ponied by I. Gutte's schooner Chlspa. the
cutter Folly and the sloops Cygnus. The
tis, Catherine and Hope. In anticipation
of a large party a great bake had been
prepared under the skilled supervision of
George Crowell, who began the mighty
work at 6 a. m. The pile of food pre
rared Included 160 buckets of clams,
twelve dozen chickens, two sacks of sweet
potatoes and six sacks of corn. Between
noon and 1 o'clock the toothsome viands
were handed out to the guests, who sat
on the promenade deck under an awning.
After luncheon Commodore W. N. Mc-
Carthy on behalf of the San Francisco
Yacht Club presented the challenge cup,
which was received by Commodore H. D.
Hawks on behalf of the Corinthian Yacht
Club. Ex-Commodore I. Gutte then pre
sented to ex-Commodon? Carl Westerfeld
a flag, on which the burges of the two
clubs are worked on a white field, with the
letters "C. C, 1900*- in blue, as a memento
of the victory of the Aeolus over the tian
Frar.ciscos' sloop Gadder. Carl Wester
feld suitably replied, thanking his crew
for tht-ir efficient and skillful work. Ex-
Commodore T. K. Tracy was next -o take
the floor, and in an unusually lucid speech
actual'y bristling with wit he requested
his fellow-yachtsmen to turn out in force
at the rowing regatta and Whitehall races
to be held on Admission clay as a part of
the festivities prepared by the semi-cen
tennial celebration committee.
The more serious part of the day's pro
ceedings bring disposed of. the Corinthian
quartet sang two excellent songs, and
"Uncle" George Bromley made one of his
characteristically witty speeches, saying
that he Â¦would have arrived on the scene
sooner had he come by an earlier boat.
In the race which took place yesterday
from the narrow-gauge mole at Alameda
out to the Presidio shoal buoy and back
the yawl Thelma finished first. J. T. Car
rier's sloop Jessie K being second, Com
modore E. N. Walter's sloop Ernbla
third and ex-Commodore A. Si. Clay's
sloop Pactolus last. The race was the
outcome of a challenge issued by the
owner of the yawl Thelma to the owners
of the above named three sloops to sail
over the Wallace trophy course In ordi
nary cruising rig to a one-gun start,
without time allowance, the owners and
crews of the two boats finishing .third and
fourth tp provide a dinner for all hands.
The starting gun was fired at 1 o'clock,
the yachts having ten minutes within
which to cress the line. The owners were
all so anxious not to precede each othor
that none got across the line within the
ten minutes. All, however, crossed it
within sixty-eight seconds later, Embla
being first, Pactolus second, Thelma third
and Jppsie K fourth. The wind was fresh
from the southwest, and on the beat out
all but one kept In the stream. Jessie E
going to leeward of Alcatraz Island and
over toward Belvedere. There she went
about, rounding the buoy on that tack.
The other three yachts made four tacks,
but all were bunched at the mark, Thel
ma rounding first. Jessie 12 second. Em
bla third and Pactolus last. The run
home was made In good time, consider
ing the fact that no light sails were used,
but no change took place In the positions
of the yachts, which finished "with a.
space of less than four minutes between
first and last. W. CÂ» Wallace and August
R. F. Brandes acted as judges. After the
race the yachts cruised up the creek to
their moorings, and in the evening the
owners and crews of all four bpats en
joyed a big dinner at the expense of the
owners and crews of the Embla and the
Pactolus. The starting and finishing
times, etc., are shown In the table:
and would have made a 'more brilliant
speech had he been fuller of spirit. Then
followed Dave McLaughlin with funny
stories, R. B. Mitchell with comicalities
and Frank W. Thompson with some excel
lent songs.. The whole proceedings were
enlivened by music furnished by the Na
tive Sons' band of San Francisco, led by
R. D. Barton.

OAKLAND.
Mr. Farrow, -130 pounds, a twirler with
out a reputation or a known local attach
ment, was put upon the slab yesterday
morning at the Oakland grounds and hiÂ»
acquitted himself in such effective man
ner as to force the fanatics to wondering
If Ewlng had at last fastened his diverg
ing managerial eyes on a piece of talent
that is of good, quality. Six times the re
puted sluggers of Stockton untwisted
Farrow, and that is all. Bunches of hits
were out of the question. Except for a
pair of singles in the sixth the most
Stockton worked off on Farrow in an in
ning was a single hit. :'
But there were a few other reasons why
Oakland won the game. Except for a sin
gle error by Francks, who had twelve
chances, the Dudes' last column woula
show a cipher. Francks' game at short
was of the ; phenomenal kind. Farrow's
Initial performance was attended bv
auspices of a most encouraging nature
The fielding of the Dudes was the best
they have done for many a day. â¢
Whalen turned the delivery wheel for
Stockton, but was not quite so fortunate
as Farrow. He experienced a bad Inning
the third, when the ball paid its respects
to tho lot. The score:
Oakland 5, Stockton 1.

STOCKTON
Oakland was in a happy mood when
Drennan tied the score in the same in
ning, and happier still at the end of the
second when the scorer at the bell rang
out four glad ones. This was the time
when Harper showed his generosity, and
Incidentally his weak right arm. Moski
man. Held. Bowman and Drennan rounded
the bags, fixing the score at 5 to 1. The
third inning brought a bit of good news
to Stockton's rooters. Eager and Strieb
traversed the much Dude beaten path,
raising the Stockton end two points. That
was the terminal work for Stockton as
far as fruits of stick work count. In the
fifth a couple of hits and a stolen base
gav Mangerlna a run, earned for him in
sections by Moskiman, who did the run
ning. The score:
Mr. Harper of the Slough City made his
entrance on the slab stage during the
afternoon game. The crowd did not display
an overweening affection for him In the
first inning, and in the second it thrust
Klondike shoulders and Icy bleacher dis
approbation at his skull. The result was
a case of bad rattles for Harper. Four
big-blown hits were secured off his -deliv
ery, which, combined with a couple of
wild throws and a passed ball, gave the
jubilant, happy Dudes four runs. Harper
recovered somewhat after this, but he
couldn't stand the frost, nor could his
hirelings stem the Brummelian tide of
victory.
All the fast play was around the second
bag. Francks and Arrellanes pocketed
everything within extended reach, par
ticularly the former, who shut off hits
with a regularity that betokened early bed
hours and other good habits. For the men
of the Sioughs Babbitt did a star stunt by
patlng up shallow left field flies. "Olu
Hutch" at first in some ground tumbling
gave an exhibition of how to fall, but at
the same time relegate the runner to thfc
morgue.
The game opened with a piece of tripli
cate fireworks. The very first ball that
Moskiman pitched fell on "Stapleton" Mc-
Carthy's willow and then lost itself on the
other side of the flagpole. McCarthy
reached third on this stick effort, scoring
on Streib's hit after McGucken and Eager
were made cemetery lodgers.
Twice in a single day did the polite
young gentlemen of Oakland batter down
the reserve and hauteur of the show
money winners. On the Oakland sod and
on the local soil Ewlng's tailenders
worked out earned victories. They swung
the stick at both of Stockton's twlrlers
and won out In both combats.
XHE Dudes have experienced a. rude
awakening. They are showing evi-
H dences of life on the diamond. They
have overcome the effects of the
many knockout drops administered early
in the season. All this means that they
have won the majority of games In the
series of three.

P"red Fortnyer, official representative ot
the Americans in the sports, said regard
ing the committee's decision: "It is quite
foreign to all our notions and rules. The
race to-day ought to have been between
the Vespers and the winner of the first
trial heat. This is the way we interpret
the rule? of racing, and unless the French
rhanKc their method we shall never again
compete in this country. Personally, 1 do
r.ot bellev* any other American crew
would be willing to enter under such con
ditions."
Tho Americars were very Indignant at
the decision cf the committee to allow
three of ih*; eights which competed In the
rirst trial heat yesterday to race in the
:lcal to-day instead of the winner. The
oomrsiUoe based its decision en thfc
gTO"Jnd that the second ar:d third crews
:n the first trial heat made faster time
than the Americacs. who won the second
trial heat. The Americans replied that
the question of time in heats is imma
terial. Moreover, they say they made no
â¢ ffort to attain fast time, in view of the
fact that their French competitors vir
tually abandoned the race when it was
labour haJf over.
The prizes were a piece of bronze stat
uary worth about JSO to each member of
the crew.
The Gher.t eight was second, the Mir.er
vas third and the Gennaaias brought up
the rear.
Immediately on the firing of the pistol
the Vespers went ahead. That their self
confidence was well founded was shown
in the first few hundred yards, when they
had leased such a lead as dispelled all
ooubt of their victory. From that mo
ment interest centered In the distance by
which they would win. Amid cheers they
Jmished an easy first by several lengths.
Time. 6:07 â¢4-S.
The conviction was shared by the book
makers, Â¦who refused all bets on the Amer
icans.
Four crews competed, the others being
the Minerva eight from Amsterdam, the
Oprnajsia of Hamburg and the Ghent
crew. The ra^o. began at 5:15 p. m. The
Americans were physically superior to
th^'.r opponents, their bis frames and ath
letic build evoking flattering comment
vrfx'n they carried their oars from the
boathouBe to the waterside and took their
places in the uhclL
Every man was trained to the hour and
s'.l regarded the result as a foregone con
clusion.
Several thousand spectators gathered
alosg the banks of the Seine, where the
regatta was hold. A large number ol
thfir fellow countrymen cheered the
American crew to victory.

been overlooked. From all over the State
the horseless carriages will steam and
puff into Sacramento to show the horses
that there la sport away from the track
and from the animal-drawn vehicles.
Two weeks of solid racing, bringing out
horses In the highest class, is the card
for those who delight In the "sport oi
kings." Polo pony races for gentlemen
riders will be arranged by Walter Ho
bart and Prince Ponlatowskl. Then the
polo players are to have several Innings,
six days of this highly exciting sport be
ing on the programme.

show, a machinery department, an art
gallery, manufactures, agricultural and
horticultural products, wines and oils, all

BIG fleet of vessels made port yes

A began to come in and when the
sun set there were still several
"square riggers" outside.
The American ship St. David from
New York was the first to get in. She
was followed by the British bark Strath
don from Newcastle, and after her came
the German steamer Tanis from Ham

ner. 30 days from Hilo: the brig Harriet
G, 31 days from Mahukona: the schooner
Allen A, 30 days from Makuhona, and the
British ship Cambrian Hills, 81 days from
Newcastle, Aus.
The Cambrian Hills left Australia a
fortnight ahead of the Strathdon. The
former vessel went around by the way of
Tahiti, while the latter followed the usual
course and mado a good run.
Tho American ship St. David made a
good run here of 154 days. The voyage
was an uneventful one except for a num
ber of heavy squalls run into before en
tering the straits of I^e Mairc. Round-
Ing tho Horn the weather was favorable
and good time was made. On August 6
in latitude 27 degrees 35 minutes north,
longitude 132 degrees 20 minutes west, the
Chilean bark Paclilco was spoken. The
latter vessel had evidently been caught
In a squall, as her fore topmast was gone
and the foremast head had carried away
about three feet below the cap. The St.
David set a signal asking If assistance
was wanted, but the only answer was the
hoisting of the Chilean flag.

He had been sick only since this morning,

Bold Thieves Make a Raid
in Sight of Police
Headquarters.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Aug. 26.
Within one hundred feet of the police
station burglars played a bold game early
Saturday morning. They ransacked the
store of A. Schlueter & Co. at 1158 Wash
ington street and carried off considerable
money and a. large quantity of Jewelry
and small articles of merchandise. The
police attribute the crime to the same
gang of thieves that two weeks ago en
tered live stores and the California Bank
on Washington and Twelfth streets,
within a radius of two blocks from the
scene of this latest raid.
That the midnight prowlers should se
lect as the scene of operations a large,
well-lighted store so near the police head
quarters that the entrance is within the
glare of the electric lights of the prison
front is conclusive evidence to the mysti
fied detectives that an unusually daring
gang was at work. Tho burglary was
not discovered until the clerks arrived
at the store Saturday morning. Strange
to say, the policemen on the beat discov
covered "the store doors open during the
early hours of the morning watch, but
made no Investigation to ascertain
the reason for the unusual circum
stance. The fact that the doors were un
locked was reported at police headquar
ters during the night, but it was for the
employes to discover why the entrance
was open.
The door had been forced with some
Instrument, presumably a burglar's steel
"jimmy," the marks being plainly visible
under "a light. The clerks found that the
store shelves and showcases had been
overhauled, but only light portable
goods, such as small pieces of jewelry
and the like, were taken. The proprie
tors have not estimated the amount of
the loss, but It will probably run into
several hundred dollars.
As usual, tho burglars left nothing be
hind by which their identity might be
traced.

The entertainment committee of the
celebration has been asked to report on
the feasibility of having all floats that
are to be shown during the day parade
form into a procession for a night parade.
The Idea was suggested by the honorary
member of the decoration committee,
who is of the opinion that floats are
shown to advantage only under the glare
of lime light or powerful searchlights.
While there are many who would like to
see a second procession, it is very doubt
ful if those who are getting these up will
be willing to stand the extra expense of
music, horses, drivers, attendants, red
tire and other lights to make an effective
showing. Some who have been spoken to
on the subject express themselves as sat
isfied with one parade.
This evening the parade committee will
close its list, and those organizations
that have not yet signllled a willingness
to take part in the parade will have to
take chances in being assigned a position
in line. Subordinates of bodies that have
accepted and will parade will be assigned
to the parent body, however.
There arc to be in the parade following

sions of Native Sons and about eleven or
twelve other divisions, including two or
three divisions of the firemen. The Pio
neers will ride in carriages and they will
have several floats. The Veterans of the
Mexican War will also ride in handsome
ly decorated vehicles. It is doubtful if
more than forty of these,: who fought on
Mexican territory in the days of *46-'47,
can be mustered to take part In the dis
play.
Many Important questions came before
the country during Grant's first term
which had to dc with party divisions at
the election of 1S72. They arose largely,
though not wholly, from the difficulties
created by the war. In his dealing with
the extraordinary conditions existing in
the country General Grant had shown
that soldierly firmness, directness and
simple common sense which was charac
teristic of our other soldier Presidents.
His personal integrity was unquestioned,
as was his honest purpose to promote pur
ity and efficiency in all departments of the
Government. But he lacked, as many suc
cessful military leaders have lacked, the
qualities necessary for wise civil adminis
tration under the" more ordinary circum
stances of his second term, when he be
came the victim of his inability to make
judicious choice of political advisers and
subordinates.
The Southern Question.
The Congressional policy of reconstruc
tion adopted in 1NS7 paved the way for
endless abuses and wholesale corruption
In the chaotic South. Full political privi
leges were conferred upon the negroes by
the fourteenth and fifteeenth amendments,
while the most able and influential white
men were debarred from them. Vhen sn
in the period of "carpet-bag" rule of un
savory memory. It is but simple justice
to say that many of the "carpet-baggers
Â¦were upright, honest, self-sacrificing and
able men, sincerely desirous of aiding
their country and their fellow citizens in
an unprecedented and most difficult crisis.
Unhappily, tt is another class whose evil
courses have made that era a hissing and

venturers from the North made haste to

Financial Questions.
quickly placed themselves at the head of
the dazed and Incompetent blacks, who
became an easy prey; they tilled the prin
cipal offices and pocketed most of the
plunder from the heavy taxes and huge
State debts which their methods fostered.
In some of the States, under this disgrace
ful leadership, protected by Federal mili
tary power, the negro majorities gained
full control, while In others the white
voters were able to soon restore white su
premacy. The situation led inevitably to
i fraud and violence, and the exasperation
i of the Southern people was extreme. In
I certain districts the elections became
sometimes mere carnivals of crime, the
powers of the Federal Government being
used In the most unblushing partisan
manner, while the opposite party respond
ed with artful Intimidation of their former
slaves and skillful use of their superioi
knowledge and power. Especially obnox
ious to the South were the Congressional
acts of 1S70 and 1S71. commonly callt*J the
force bills, imposing harsh penalties for
any interference with the negro franchise,
and the Ku-Klux movement was a sort
of retaliation to those measures. The
more violent phase of the agitation, how
ever died down ere long, and the general
amnesty act of 1872 aided the approach or
more quiet conditions. Various judicious
mollifying decisions of the Supreme Court
helped to clarify the views ana temper
the passions of all parties. The people
came slowly back to their senses. But the
long and serious strain upon the constitu
tional principles of our Government did
not end until those principles had been
subjected to the supreme test of the year
1 1876.
The last of the States to be readmitted
fulfilled the required conditions in July,
1S70 and reconstruction was complete: but
the'southern question was far from being
settled, and the several national conven
tions of 1S72 all pronounced upon the prob
lem. From that time on. however, party
readjustments took place -without much
reference to Southern affairs.
The creation of national banks under
Federal law in 1S63-64 was one of the war
measures of the Government. The orig
inal purpose was to create a market for
the Government : bonds. The system
proved successful and national bank notes
soon supplanted all. others. As a party
measure it was, however, subjected to
constant criticism by the opposition, as
was the issue of a full legal-tender paper
currency yet earlier.
The Republican party committed Itself
in lStÂ» in the speedy resumption of specie
payments, and also to the payment in
coin of the interest-bearing bonds of the
Government. Opposition to the national
banks has never fully died out, and in the
campaign of 1S72 the resumption policy of
the party and the too rapid reduction of
the national debt were also subjected to
criticism.
Annexation of San Domingo.
General Grant had strongly urged the
annexation of the negro republic of San
Domingo, and had labored with all his
powers to create a public sentiment In
favor of the scheme. Though the project
had been abandoned because of the oppo
sition of the Senate, yet in pushing the
matter with unwise Insistence the Presi
dent had alienated two of his strongest
party leadersâ Sumner and Greeiey â
whose influence greatly helped the oppo
sition In his second canvass.
Civil Service Reform.
The Tariff.
The stupendous evils resulting from the
acceptance by both parties since the time
oc Jackson of the "spoils" system In po
litical administration had by this time be
come so apparent that serious uneasiness
was felt. The lonsr tenure of power in the
Republican party had developed those
evils to such scandalous proportions as
had never before been known. General
Grant heartily favored legal regulation of
admissions to the civil service, and the
first civil service reform act was passed
In 1S71. But so deep seated was the evil
and so unfortunate was the President in
his choice of persons to assist him In his
praisworthy efforts that the odium
fastened upon the party, and the admin
istration was such as to disgust and alien
ate many of their supporters.
The great increase In tarifT duties made
during the war was now filling the United
States treasury to overflowing and an em
barrassing surplus was accumulating. A
widespread demand for tariff reform
spread over the land, being particularly
strong In the West, whose agricultural
population had failed to derive from the
high war duties a fair share of the ad
vantage. In that part of the country
party lines were threatening to disappear
as the tariff question gained prominence.
In all the platforms of the numerous
parties or factions holding conventions In
1S72 some reference is made to the desired
regulation of duties.
"Liberal" Republican Convention.
The tendency toward a combination of
the several elements opposed to Grant
Â¦was first manifest in Missouri as early as
1S70, and from that State came the prop
osition for a national convention of those
Republicans calling themselves "liberal"'
to nominate a Presidential ticket. A
movement tending to divide the Demo
cratic party appeared about the same
tima in Ohio, and by the time the liberal
Republican convention met a large pro
portion of the national Democratic party
was ready to join with them to defeat
Grant.
The convention, which met in Cincin
nati in May. was really a mass meeting,
having no regular party organization. A
long platform was adopted arraigning the
administration In scathing terms for wan
tonly seeking to destroy the fundamental
principles of constitutional government
and charging the President in person
with partisan corruption' and the prosti
tution of his official power to personal
ends. It pledged the party to maintain
the Union and to accept the results of
the war; demanded universal amnesty,
restoration of the writ of habeas corpus,
thorough civil service reform, mainte
nance of the public credit and speedy re
turn to specie payments. A majority of
the convention were pronounced free
traders, but they were persuaded to yield
that principle to the necessity for uniting
all the forces of opposition to Grant, and
a. resolution framed by the great protec
tionist, Greeley, was accordingly passed
with reluctance, and on th<Â» sixth ballot
Greeley was nominated for President, B.
Gratz Hrown of Missouri was made can
didate fur Vice President.
"Regular" Republican Convention.
Grant was nominated by acclamation
by the National Republican Convention
at Philadelphia and Henry Wilson was
nominated for Vice President on tho flr3t
ballot. The platform gave much space to
vaunting the achievements of the glorious
party during its eleven years of suprem
acy. It demanded complete liberty and
exact equality in civil and political rights
for all men. irrespective of race, color,
creed or previous condition of servitude:
approved civil service reform: favored a
well-regulated protective tariff, suppres
sion of disturbances in the South and
protection of the ballot box; supported
the amnesty act. and deprecated uncon
stitutional interference with the reserved
rights of the people.
"Regular" Democratic Convention.
Kighteen State Democratic conventions
met before the assembling of the national
convention at Baltimore and instructed
their delegates to indorse the platform
and candidates of the Cincinnati conven
tion. It was accordingly done, though
not without some strongly expressed op
position and much more that was silent.
Straight Democratic Convention.
The great dissatisfaction among tho
Democrats with the action of their party
members In the Cincinnati and Baltimore
conventions led to still another conven
tion, called at Louisville. Ky. It met in
September, with a large attendance. The
platform adopted exalted the State in the
extreme States' rights fashion: set forth
constitutional views of the strictest con
struction type; repudiated the Baltimore
convention and declared In favor of tariff
for revenue only. Tho candidates wcro

gentlemen declined the honors thrust

Minor Conventions.
The labor reformers held the first con
vention of the year at Columbus. Ohio, in
February. Their platform was an impos
ing document. It set forth the duty of
the Government to provide "a purely na
tionaal circulating medium, based on tho
faith and resources of the nation, issued
directly to the people without the inter
vention of any system of banking corpo

a one-term Presidency. David Davis of
Illinois and Joel Parker of New Jersey
were nominated, but in June both wlth-
The Prohibitionists also chose can

The Election.
Though the final result was never
really in doubt, a somewhat exciting cam
paign took place. Mr. Greeley had done
long and worthy service for his party and
many were grieved at his defection. Ho
carried through an energetic canvass, tak
ing the unusual step of making a series
of stump speeches himself. His death
before the meeting of the electors was
believed to be due to his heart-broken
disappointment at the result of the popu
lar election. The resular Republican
ticket won with a large increase of tho
popular vote, due largely to the disorgani
zation In the Democratic party. That
party had now reached Its lowest ebb ana
seemed on the point of going Irretrievably

The count of the electoral votes la
February, 1S73. gave rise to many dis
puted questions, the most important of
which were those pertaining to the Stato
of Louisiana, Political quarrels there had
brought about the formation of two re
turning boards, each claiming to be legit
imate The returning board had authority
to canvass the votes cast and to reject
those of all counties, or parishes, whero
Illegal means had been used. Thus two
State Governments and two Legislatures,
one Republican and one Democratic, were
declared elected and demanded recogni
tion by Congress, and two sets of electors
forwarded Presidential returns to Wash
ington. After much discussion both seta
of returns were finally rejected by vote
of both houses. This was the first case to
arise involving contests between two con
flicting State governments. We were to>
hear more of them In after years.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 26.âGover
nor Central Wood was officially banquet
ed last night by the Republican and Dem
ocratic parties. The civil Governor, the
Archbishop of Cuba, the principal judicial
and civil dignitares and a hundred repre
sentative merchants were present.
The Archbishop said the time had ar
rived for peace. He said he was happy to
greet tho people of the United States In
the person of General Wood.
Senor Tamayo, Secretary of State, said:
"General Wood is the true friend of Cuba.
The United States Government is sincere
in the promises it has made."
Governor General Wood on rising was
greeted with shouts of approbation and
"vivas," which were taken up by 3(M> peo
ple, assembled cutside the clubhouse. He
spoke in part Â«ia follows^*
Whatever the ultimate destiny of Cuba may
be, its immediate future is Independence. Thl3
Is no pointful move on the jiart of thu Unlterl
States, but a sincere desire to do what Is
ripht. Therefore I beg you. as a personal fa
vor to me aÂ»d to the United States Govern
ment to sink your present differences and pas
&ion3 ftrtil to send ni<^n to t h<5 con vent-ion who
are renowned for honor and capacity, so that
the convention may mean more than the Cu
bans even now anticipate.
I rare r-ot what your narty politics are; but
whatever they are, for the present party con
sl'lt rations must be suspended for the sake, of
thtt great end in view; the end that will make
I is t:;ry and affect the welfare of all Cuban
people.
Your dele-ates must be competent to draft
a constitution. Bear in mind t^at no consti
tution which does not provide for a stablo gov
ernment will be accepted by the United States.
I v, ish to avoid making Cuba Into a second
llaytien. although I do not think that possi
ble.
You want liberty for ell and for no particular
party. The United States insists that you
shall have It. This Is possible and easily pos
Bit-I?. We have said it to the world. It lies
with vnu to helD us make our word good.
Your enemies predict failure. Tho people of
the I'nifMl States and their representatives
hope to see you defeat these predictions. If we
were not vour friends, we would not seek
the best men you have, tut would seek the dls
turhe' 1 and the malcontent to represent you in
the convention. We seek and demand the best
you have. Aciln I say. send pepole to the
convention who will hereafter make your po
litical system workable and permanent.
â¢ General Wood's speech is considered by
Cubans to be the most important declara
tion made since the American occupation
began. ,
The Cuban flaer was rnised over the pal
ace to-day by General Wood's permission,
thousands of Cubans witnessinK the cere
mony. Later in the afternoon the Ameri
can, Cuban and Spanish (lags were fas
tened together in decorations in the prin
cipal theater, where General Wood was
present. This was the first time the
Spanish flag was> exhibited since the evac
uation.
Governor Is Tendered an
Ovation by Thousands
of Persons.

Men Obtainable in the Island,
Irrespective of Party,

AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Aug. 2G.
rhe result of the primary elections yes
terday left little to bo decided for an aft
ma*tfc. The votes were all decisive if all
*Â».e agreements are lived up to, and the in
c:cat!or.s are that they will be.
S-.:ito Senator E. K. Taylor of Alaaieda
Â¦wr-s to-Blght announced as a candidate for
Presidential Elector from this district,
subject to the action of the Republican
ItEte Convention at Santa Cruz. The
Third Congressional District will be er.tl
t>d to one Presidential Elector, and Ala
rr..ia. County is by far the largest Integral
ran or this district and can name the
Elector if it wishes. Senator Ta>lcr vrou'.d
like that honor. Senator Taylor will have
thÂ« Korty-sixth and Forty-seventh Assem
bly flletricts in this county to begin with,
r.one of the other delegations having been
tanvassed upon this point.
As a matter of fact the delegates to the
Ftate convention were so loosely selected
that no one seems to know even the
: arnes of those voted for. The county
commit: (-emen in each district named the
<1*-:eeatfE. and few ballots were cast fur
themâ just enough to legalize their elec
tion. Very litlle Interest was taken in
this election or the election for dÂ» legates
to the county convention, Â¦which will nom
inate Judges.
The Forty-ninth Assembly District sn
r.ounced its intention of standing by the
agreement upon Supervisor In the Fifth
I'istrlot. and that -will mean the nomina
tion of John Mitchell.
The Democrat! :ire already talking of
rcniJr.atirg either Torn Lnndregan or ei-
FherifT Gaivj:; B. White in opposition to
Mitcbell. W. S. Pelouze will run as an
Independent, and there is every prospect
of a lively fight. In this district.
There is foatc talk of the Democrats
ruminating R. W. Miller, formerly School
I'irertor and an ardent Bryan Democrat,
for CcrgrPFs. Mr. Miller is earnestly or-
Far.izing Democratic clubs - in Oakland.
Hiram Ijuttzdl is hi? principal opponent
in Oakland.

FILLED with the glee of careless childhood, Elmer Locke, aged 8 years
residing with his widowed mother at SoS 1^ Folsom street, was disport
ing himself with his favorite playmate, a Det dog, late yesterday af
ternoon when an electric car bore down upon him and Inflicted Injuries
that will likely prove fatal. Usually dogs are wary and exercising the won
derful agility possessed by them escape all threatened onslaughts from ve
hicles. In this case, however, the devoted canine went to death beside Its
little master. The child called and the little one's dumb playmate ran to
his side, as if feeling that the boy needed protection from the electrically
propelled monster that was about to grind him to death.
Several of Elmer's playmates, seeing the car approaching at a lively
rate of speed, shouted to the unfortunate boy to "look out," but too late
to save him from being mangled.
Elmer was picked up In a semi-conscious condition and Immediately re
moved to the Receiving Hospital. An examination by Drs. Dray and Irones
revealed tho fact that the little fellow's skull was fractured and his right
leg mangled to such an extent that it was found necessary to amputate It.
At a late hour last night the doctors entertained little hope for the child's
recovery.
It was shortly after 5 o'clock that thÂ© unfortunate boy left his home to
take his dog "for a walk." as he expressed it. After performing several
tricks to the delight of Its youthful master, the canine started to cross Fol
som street between Fourth and Fifth. Elmer, after vainly endeavoring 1 to
call the dog to him. started after it According to several eye-witnesses, he
walked to the middle of the street and stood on the car track, as If deliber

Edmund Williamson, an old printer, died
under peculiar circumstances early this
morning on California street and Pratt
place, a small alley above Stockton street.
Williamson resided at 816 California
street. At about 11 o'clock last night he
went to hi3 home and calling the landlady
told her that he nad fallen from a car and
had received a few bruises.
He claimed that his wounds had been
dressed in Joy's drug store on Keerny
and California streets. He showed her
a wound over the eye and another on the
head, both of which were covered with
plaster. Williams then left the landlady
and she thought that he was about to
retire.
At about 12 o'clock two well dressed
young men entered John Lackmann's gro
cery, at California street and Prospect
place, and said that an old man who had
told them he Hved in the neighborhood
was lying outside and was hurt.
Several people in the store went out to
see the man, and the two young men were
heard to remark, "We have brought him
so far and have done enough. He Is with
friends now: let them look out for him."
They then left the scene.
The man lay propped up against a gar
den fenc# and seemed to be breathln"
faintly. The Receiving Hospital was no
tified, but when the* ambulance arrived
the man was dead.
Judging fr6m remarks of the young men
it is thought that Williamson left the
house after interviewing the landlady and
had started to go downtown. His wound
was probably more serious than he at first
supposed and he suddenly collapsed
The body was removpd to the Morgue
An autopsy will probably show that the
fall from the car had resulted in a frac
ture of tho skull.
Williamson was about 55 years* of age

were epoken very long- ago. They
were spoken to a womanâ a low woman
at a well, a disreputable woman and a

Now the Jews have no dealing with the
Samaritan. It would have been as peril
ous for a Samaritan to sit down to dine
with a Jew as for a black man in the
south to sit down with a white man. It
meant his death. Tho Jew who speaks

smites all distinctions between all classes

The Salvation of God.
"That may serve as a more simple ex
position to the casual student of the
scripture I have just read, but there is
suggested to my mind some more pro
found truths which I desire to Impress
upon your mind this morning. First, if
the salvation of God is from the Samar
itan, the saivationof God is from one
one man to another man, and all men be
come the savers of men, and there are no
men saved who are not saved by some
other man.
"What a responsibility that leaves in
your doorway and mine! Xot only Is the
present generation charged with the re
sponsibility of Its own salvation, but
through itself of all generations that arc
to come, and the individual is made re
sponsible while he lives not only for part
nershipâthe high and holy partnership
with God in the salvation of the worldâ
but for a personal individual duty that
holds that individual for the salvation of
another. None are too old to be relieved
from the responsibility: none are too
young not to inherit the privilege."
God's Business; Man's Business.
Rev. Dr. Easton of Washington. D. C .
occupied the pulpit of the Westminster
Presbyterian Church yesterday morning
and preached an able sermon. He took
for his text Luke 11-49: "Wist ye not I
must be about my Father's business?"
At the outset of his discourse he an
nounced as his theme "God's Business:
Man's Best Business."
A Missionary From China. -
The Rev. Dr. Peck, a returned mission
ary from China, delivered an interesting
and stirring sermon last night at the
Richmond Congregational Church.
"To What Purpose Is This Waste?" was
the text he selected, and his address was
on the present crisis in China.
"The eyes of the civilized world are at
present centered on China." he said. "The
difrerer.t Governments are anxious for
some of the territory. The churches are
looking for places to establish their cross.
It ought to be of interest to even' one
what will become of China. Christians es
pecially. China wiir be a great factor in
the future history of the world. She has
a number of religions. The Buddhist re
ligion'has seen much persecution similar
to Christianity, but it is a dead issue. The
temples are all falling to decay and are
thinly attended. Mohammedanism was
forced on the Chinese by former rulers of
the people, and that also has a very poor
outlook. I read recently In a paper of the
lecture that Ho Yow, the Chinese Consul
gave, and his great excuse for the upris
ing is that the Christian missionaries force
religion upon the natives, whether they
want it or not. I have lived in China for
the past twenty years and have never
once seen a misisonary force religion on
any one. I was in a hospital as a physi
cian, and even there we did not talk're
ligion to the patients if they did not wish
to hear it. I also do not think that the
American press are giving the native con
verts to Christianity the credit that is
due them. I know for a fact, but I never
paw it published, that the men that hauled
that big twelve-inch gun from the English
ship Terrible, that did so much effective
work in the bombardment of Tientsin
were Christian Chinese. The young Em
peror of China was most progressive and
was anxious to have all the young men
that surrounded him well educated In
modern science. The Empress of China
on her sixtieth birthday was presented
with a beautiful bound copy of the Bible
the young Emperor read it and sent down
to the misisonary headquarters in Peking
for several more copies of the book. He
afterward read several scientific books
which no doubt opened his eyes, and it
was for his desire for reform that he was
overthrown. â¢ ,

fact the tragredy of thÂ© nineteenth cen
tury. It Is impossible for any man to be
so blind that he cannot see God's finger
coming out of the darkness and writing
on the western sky the wonderful things
that are transpiring in Eastern Asia by
his providence? Why are we In the Orient?
Why was that day in May prophetic of
this later day in May? Why was this
earlier relation between America and Ja
pan somehow linked with this later devel
opment between America and China?
Why is it that the island empire, the Eng
land of the Pacific, stretches along our
border until now from our southernmost
possessions, she looks across upon our
newly acquired territory In the Philip
pines? Why was this conflict so held
back until America became a world power
and acknowledged as such by the great
nations of Europe? Why are we there on
the very borders of the Celestial empire
with an army trained in the arts of war
to join an army of picked men under of
ficers who command the hosts of mighty
nations?
"Oh, my friends, there is a destiny that
rules. There is a providence that never
varies. There Is no power to call America
back from this theater of activity. The
idle rumors that Germany, Russia and
Japan have decided to carry on the war
fare with China and to ask the retirement
of England and America is absurd on Its
very face. America to retire when the
cause of humanity is at stake? England
to withdraw the banner that stands for
freedom and protection because a combi
nation of nations asks it? Why, the sug
gestion shows Its absurdity.
The speaker said the bond between Eng
land and America, although unwritten. Is
an alliance of blood, an alliance of com
mon purpose, and that the nations will
never go down or out of the field of
activity. Continuing, he said:
"Any man can tell there is this trouble
in China. One man may give one reason
and another still another reason. All of
these reasons are invaluable as a part of
the erreat answer."
Missionaries Are Accused.
The speaker charged that the trouble
was due to the interference and arrogance
of power by missionaries, and he laid
stress on 'the fact that the Jesuits, who
were driven out of France, were primarily
the cause of the uprising. Hfe said that
the Chinese nation saw the nationsâRus
sia, Japan and Gefmanyâ grabbing Its
kingdom, and anger smouldered in the
breasts of the natives until it became a
raging volcano and finally burst, causing
death and ruin to thousands of people and
property. The speaker drew a beautiful
picture of the regeneration of China. He
gave it as his opinion that the Angel of
Peace would soon again hover over the
land, ana that that nation, whicti nas for
centuries past been' sluggish, would
awaken and the march of civilization
would pass through the land, and soon
again the missionaries would be trodding
the streets of Peking and Tientsin in
safety.
Bishop Hamilton delivered his initial
sermon In his new field vesterday morning
at the Howard M. B. Church. The dis
tinguished visitor proved a forcible talker
and impressed the large congregation
which listened to his discourse. The text
of his sermon was taken from the fourth
chapter according to St. John, and the
latter part of the twenty-second verse:
"For Salvation Is of the Jews." In part
he said:
"This Is one of the paradoxes of the New
Testament. A paradox Is a truth con
cealed or disguised in what at the time
may be doubtedâ may seem to be untrue;
but which time demonstrates varily to be
truth. The most widely known and widely
scattered people of the earth have been
the Jews. For this reason the Bible stu
dent has been led to exaggerate their
number and Importance to contempora
neous people. The fact is there have not
been very many Jews, and there are not
many Jews now. There are more people
in London and New York than there are
Jews In all the earth. In Russia, where
there are the most, there are scarcely
more than 4,000.000, and In Austria-Hun
gary not more than 2,000,000. According to
tho last census there were more Mormons
than Jews in this country; but the great

Since He Was 14 Years
of Age.
S. Bernstein, the young man who tried
to "flim-flam" Henry Wolff, manufactur
ing jeweler, 120 Sutter street, Saturday
out of four watches, was released on
bonds yesterday. Wolff admitted that he
had learned of Bernstein's intentions and
that what he gave him were gold cases
without the works. This brought the
charge down to a mlsdemanor and his
bonds were fixed in $300.
The young man has also bean swindling
cigar men by making false representations
to them. He secured 500 cigars from Lev
in & Posener, 106 Clay streÂ«r., an-J 1500
cigars from S. Bachman & Co.. Pine ond
Battery streets. He was identified by
Lewis Levin in the City Prison yesterday
before being released. It is probable that
the victims will swear to complaints
against him to-day.
Bernstein is only 21 years of age. but he
has been engaged in swindling business
men since he was 14. He has been arrest
ed before for the same offense, hut his

Returning- Board May Caiase Arrests.
Â¦Iff. No-- Retoros Are Received No
Credentials Will Be Issued,
THE Herrin-Kelly-Crimmins hench
men who ignored the regular return
ing board of eighteen and took the
returns of eight districts and those
of one precinct of another to Shiels Hall
after the polls for the Republican primary
Friday were closed may be ajrested on a
criminal charge as a result of their Ir
regular proceeding. Members of the re
turning board have discussed informally
the advisability of taking such a step,
but have postponed action until the meet
ing of the board to-night.
The- election paraphernalia was all se
cured from the returning board of- eigh
teen, members of the County Central
Committee either taking the ballot boxes,
tickets, tallysheets, etc., for their respec
tive districts or writing orders for their
delivery to some of their political friends.
The property, for -which the returning
board is responsible to the Election Com
mission, was*signÂ£d for by those to whom
it was entrusted. In consequence, what
is virtually a trust contract exists be
tween them and the returning board.
In some cases among tne eignc and a
half precincts the ballet boxes were re
turned, but in each of them some portion
of the election paraphernalia is still not
accounted for, and the responsibility for
its safe return to the returning board rests
with the men who received It.
The Herrin-Kelly-Grimmins men rec
ognized the authority of the returning
board by coming to it for ballot boxes,
tickets, tally sheets and returns blanks.
Having done so, they were under the
necessity of bringing the returns to the
same board. In going to Shiels Hall with
them they ignored the provisions of the
call, which specifically stated that the
returns should be taken to the County
Central Committee headquarters at 930
Market street. The envelopes provided
for enclosing the ballots, tally sheets and
lists of voters were addressed to John R.
Hillman, chairman of the returning board.
May Be Prosecuted.
The returning board will meet to-night
at 8 o'clock. If by that time the para
phernalia, and election returns of
each district have not been re
turned in full it is extremely
probable that steps will be taken to prose
cutÂ© tho men whose signatures show that
they received the property. Application
for search warrants will probably be made
in order to recover the missing property
and also for warrants for the arrest of
the guilty henchmen of the Mint saloon
bosses. If that action is decided upon,
not only will the men who received the
paraphernalia be prosecuted, but also the
Â©lection officers who took it into their
keeping, thereby becoming jointly respon
sible for its return.
The following are the districts from
which all or a part of the election para
phernalia and- returns have not been re
ceived: Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth,
Thirtieth, Thirty-first, one precinct of the
Thirty-seventh, the Thirty-eighth, For
tieth, Forty-third and Forty-fifth. These
are the districts the returns from which
I were taken to Shiels Hall, the ballot
boxes, tally-sheets, etc., being afterward
carted around according to the whim of
the individuals who had possession of
them.
The Implied trust contract between the
returning board and those who received
the property would require its prompt re
turn upon the termination of the use for
which it was given out. The Herrin-
Kelly-Crimmins henchmen might as well
have taken the ballot-boxes and returns
direct to the Mint saloon and there have
surrendered them into the keeping of tho
bosses as to have made Shiels Hall their
temporary depository. For anything that
is known to the contrary, the missing
property may now actually be in the pos
session of Kelly and Crlmmins.
The returning board of eighteen is
standing firm on one propositionâ that no
credentials will be Issued to district dele
gates whose election is not shown by re
turns made to the board. The high
standing of the men composing the re
turning board, whose names and occu
pations are tabulated above, was a
guarantee that fair dealing would have
be*n accorded the candidates no matter
to which faction they belonged.
Heelers Were Afraid.
Fair dealing, however, was not what
the Hprrin-Kelly-Crimmins heelers want
ed. They were afraid for their returns
to go before a board that would not
wink at documentary evidence of ballot
box stuffing, repeating, and stealing in
