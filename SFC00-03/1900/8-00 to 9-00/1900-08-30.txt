Fatal Encounter Ensues.
Special Dispatch to. The Call.
ALBUQUERQUE. N.M., Aug. Â».-A
double tragedy occurred near Belen. Just
south of this city, at noon to-day.

marks derogatory to the character of
Miss Lopez. â¢
Melqulades, buckling on his six-shooter,
went out to find David. They met and, as
David had been warned and armed him
self, commenced firing, simultaneously.
Each fired three shots and each was hit
three times. Both are now dead. David
lived about an hour longer than Melqui
ades. Both victims have relatives In this
city, besides a horde of them in Valencia
County, and a family feud is likely to
result f torn this double tragedy. .
David E. Baca, one of the victims, is
married to the sister of. a woman he Is
said to have slandered. Several years ago
at a ball David figured in a fight, over the
woman he married, which resulted In one
young man being wounded by ,a pistol
shot and his opponent being maimed for
life with a bowie knife.

WHAT IS WANTED BY
. THE VARIOUS POWERS
BERLIN, Aug. 23.â Herr von Brandt. *i
former Minister to China, was interviewed
to-day regarding the Chinese situation.
He said: !
."It is an error to assume that the Chi- |
nese trouble is at an end with the relief of
the foreign legations.- As a- matter "or
fact, it has but just begun, because now
the divergent interests of the powers are
asserting themselves.' No uoubt the
United States would conclude peace im
mediately and act as arbitrator If unfor
tunately Chinese duplicity were riot so ap
parent. .Russia wants. the Empress Dow
ager retained. Great Britain wants Em
peror Kwang Su at the head- of affairs.
Germany runs the risk of being isolated
or of being compelled to confront a' coali
tion of several powers if. after the ar
rival of .Count von Waldersee. she should
wish to continue action, perhaps single
handed, or if in her demands for redress
she should go further than the powers
principally interested in China."
Regarding' the causes that led to the
Chinese troubles Herr von Brandt quoted
verbatim the text of a remarkable report
made by the chief of the RusBo-Asiatlc
Bank of Peking on June 15 last, but not
heretofore published. Tho passage of the
greatest Interest Is as follows: . .
"A majority of, the Peking legations
have decided to demand the creation of
foreign settlements in Peking like those
at the treaty harbors immediately .after
the arrival in Peking 'of strong "detach
ments.. M. 'de Giers, Russian Minister,
will endeavor to reduce this demand to
the appointment of foreign police commis
sioners under command of. the legations
Several of the legations desire a special
regency over the Emperor and the re
moval of the Empress Dowager from
power, but M. de Glers insists upon re
taining the powers of the Empress Dow
ager, since the above arrangement would
Induce several powers to demand the ap
pointment of their candidates as members
of the regency.",
This report did not, reach St. Petersburg
until July 30. Commenting upon it, Herr
von Brandt remarked: '"This shows how
far the Peking Ministers. wished to go
even before serious difficulties, began." "

KESWICK. Aug. 23.â Gold and platinum,
instead of water, is what John Trapnell
struck in digsring a well in Keswick. He
had dug down thirty odd feet, but had
not found much evidence of water. Then
he struck a layer of auriferous sand mucR
more valuable than water.
Trapnell is an old miner and he panned
out a double handful of the sand and
was thunderstruck ,to obtain more than
a dollar's worth of gold dust. The sand
Is heavy and he Is assured that It con
tains platinum. He Is not positive as to
that, however, but he knows gold when
he sees It. The deposit of the gold-bearing
rand is about a foot In thickness. The
discovery was made yesterday. Trapnell
will sink the well no deeper. He doesn't
want water now. He will turn the well
into a mining shaft und drift on the blind
lead he has uncovered. He has only a
small lot fifty by a hundred and fifty
feet, but it Is his to the center of the
earth, and if the blind lead yields as well
as the prospects Indicate he will have a
comfortable sum. Town lots In his imme
diate vicinity are no longer for sale.

MISSIONARIES SAVED
BY CONSUL FOWLER
VANCOUVER. B. C. Aug. 29.-Seventy
i missionaries from China returned to-day
i by the Empress of China. Many had al
j most miraculous escapes. After the
| trouble had come to a head. Rev. J. M.
Menzles, with his wife and family, were
) on their way to the coast from their sta-
I tion in Honan and were not aware of any
j trouble when they left. In company with
them were Dr. McClure and Dr. Olrs.)
Wallis, also going to the coast. These at
â¢ tribute their escape entirely to the efforts
j of John Fowler, American Consul at
j Chefu.
"We were four days late In startins."
said Or. - Menzies, "and "the "delay was, 1
believe, the saving of our lives. Had we
started at the time we originally Intended,
we would have been in the heart of the
Boxer infested district, from which there
vrould have been noescape. As it was we
! leached Paungehuang and at that place
was a message from Mr. Fowler, warning
us that all traffic on the river was ex-
I tremely dangerous, and that any mission
aries in the Interior should' hurry at once
to places of safety. Had we gone on a
few miles further we would have been
shot by the Boxors, who were watching
on both sides of the river.
"With an escort of Chinese soldiers we
were enabled to safely reach a small port
on the coast. Yangchiakon, and there it
was that the services of Mr. Fow'ler
proved so helpful. It was not a safe place
to remain in and I have no hesitancy in
stating that the story would not now be
as it is had it not been for the aia
rendered by the American Consul. Mr.
' Fowler, at his personal expense, chartered
two Japanese steamers, which made six
trips, and besides sent a .warship, -which
made one trip. For you must remember
that Christian workers from the Interior
had been gathering at this out-of-the-way
port until there were seventy-three all
told of missionaries alone."-
Rev. Mr. McKenzie of all the ministers
on board had the most exciting trip. He
was with the party composed of Rev.
Messrs. Goforth. Leslie and Griffiths, all
of whom were wounded. Goforth some-
what seriously. They were In stations not
far distant from that of Mr. Menz'es, and
to them the doctor sent Consul Fowler's
message from Paungchuang.
"When we received the dispatch," said
Mr. McKenzip. "we instantly made all
haste to depart. The letter warned us not
to go north by the. route followed by Dr.
MenziÂ»Â»s, so we formed a party and start
ed southward. We had ten carts in all
and a twenty-four-day trip ahead of us
to reach Hankow. Oh the twelfth day we
met an organized body of the Boxers, who
made a deliberate attack. Mr. Goforth
received a very severe sword cut across
the back of the neck, besides being
wounded In several other places. An In
furiated fanatic made a lunge at Mrs. Go
forth with a sword, but she shielded her
self with a pillow. It was a very exciting
hour.
"Two of our escorts were killed and five
of our animals shot. Mr. Leslie was
wounded badly in the wrist Â«nd knee, be
sides sundry other small cuts about his
person. Mr. Griffith was Injured on al
most every part of his body. I myself
was wounded In the head, leg and hand.
It was a most fortunate occurrence that
my arm was not cut off. I was standing
with a revolver pointed at one of the
nearest of the ruffians and had! Intimidat
ed him. when another came up behind me.
I caught eight of the descending sword as
it flashed in the sun and warded off the
full stroke of the weapon. It glanced and
struck the back of my hand."

that the British* Government does not sen
any cause to depart from the line of

Herald Publishing Company.
TAKTT (via Shanghai), Aug. 29.â Rumors are prevalent here of the increas
ing friction between the Japanese and Russians, all probably based on the
fact that both powers are pouring thousands of troops into Northern
China, this extraordinary situation being created by Great Britain and
America not being at war with China. It is believed that Russia will ask
the powers to withdraw all their troops from Peking, as their object, the relief
of the legations, has been accomplished. The country around Taku and Peking
has been devastated, with the result that the Boxers are most unpopular with
the country people, who are attacking them. The Boxers are moving north from
Shantung and returning hastily to their homes.
HOXGKOXG, Aug. 29.â The disturbed situation in Amoy has been created by
the Japanese for the purposes of aggression. For years Japan has covetously
regarded Amoy and her opportunity has occurred. It was offered by a Japan
ese priest's houso in the city being burned. The Chinese maintain that the
priest saturated his house with kerosene and then charged them with arson. A
Japanese cruiser smartly landed men. who are now policing Kulang Hen and
Amoy. There has been no riot and no trouble, but Japan claims that a large
number of Jopanese subjects re<julre protection. These subjects are of the Chi
nese criminal classes, who escape from Justice and are registered in Formosa as
Japanese subjects for a small fee.

Japan, and its contents were given serious consideration by the President. Sec
retary Root and Acting Secretary or State Adee at a conference held Jaat night.

the Russian proposal that it does not suggest the immediate withdrawal of
troops from China, but only the withdrawal of the allied forces from the capital.
In the interest of the security of foreign life and property in Manchuria and In
other parts of China. Russia deems it important that the international troops
should continue on duty therein. But she asserts the opinion that the Imperial
Government can more readily re-establish itself In power and assume control
of affairs throughout the empire, if Peking is abandoned to the Chinese and the
allieâ¢ retire to a convenient distance.
M. de Wollant, asserted yesterday afternoon that Russia does not desire the
dismemberment of -China and his views are based upon the proposal he sub-'
mltted to the President through the State Department.
While deeply gratified that Russia should have taken this position there Is a
disposition in certain quarters to suspect the motive of the St. Petersburg Gov
ernment. It Is no secret that Russia and Germany were believed to have deter
mined to pursue the same policy with r<?spect to China, and the dispatch of such
a formidable body of German troops and the augmenting of the German
squadron presaged to some officials here the intention of the two Governments
named to precipitate a partition of China. It is understood the Cabinet dis
cussed the probable causes of Russia's action, but aside from the belief that It
was due to desire to bring about the retirement of forces of the nations antag
onistic to her from the Chinese capita!, the officials are as much in the dark as
to the" reasons for the move as are thosÂ« of any other nation.
"France undoubted^ will supi^rt the Russian proposal. Great Britain and
Japan may. approve it. though they may Impose the condition that the Russian
forces evacuate Nluchwang. and Germany will not. it Is believed, favor It. The
attitude of the United States will undoubtedly have an important bearing upon
'the action taken by European powers and Japan upon the Russian proposal, and
; !t, is -th-e Presiid^nt will -decide tÂ«'rommunteute the American answer
to all the powers for their information.

LAYTONVILLE, Aug. 29.â With a roaring as of thunder and a great spouting of a mass of bluish-black
liquefied earthy matter, the remarkable mud volancoes of Mendocino County again became active to-day after
a subsidence of nearly f seven weeks. â¢ â¢ v . v J â¢ -
The noise of the violent . disturbance was plainly heard all day and many people went to the scene im
mediately after the first evidence -of activity became known. This singular phenomenon is occurring at a point
eight miles south of here, V.'ltjs stated that, the -spouting of mud from the craters'" is contemporaneous with the
tides of the ocean, and it is thought that they are either connected with the ocean by some subterraneous channel
or acted upon- 'directly by\ the influence of, the moon or whatever i causes the Vbb and flow of the tides of the
sea.. Yet the volcanoes are twenty miles from the ocean. It is certainly a curious freak of nature and worthy
the research of the scientist -There are about twenty-five _of the volcanoes in\the group. The earth about is bar
ren of vegetation. The surface- 'of this barren spot appears as if some mighty hydraulic power, had cleared it of its
timber. , The volcanoes ; are ibout : five feet above the surfice.of the earth, from five to eight feet in diameter at the
base and from three to four feet at.the mouth. These muddy f craters are filled with a bluish mud of Â¦ about the
consistency of boiling mortar. and. when active steam. and bubble like, boiling water and make a. thunderous roar
that can be heard for miles around. To-night the disturbance is so violent that the : mud belches '? forth o'verlthe
rims of 'the craters, " flowing. !down the mountain side. A warm vapor, that shoots high into the air, accompanies
the spouting ' of mud. *? â¢ ,, W" .^ â¢ \

SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 29.â J. E. King,
murderer, is in a cell in the County
Jail of Marin. awaiting arraign
ment for the slaying of S. H.
Church, the Two Rocks Valley
farmer. There is no doubt of the pris
oner's identity. To-night he admitted to
a Call reporter that he was King. He
was positively identified during the day,
also by Deputy Sheriff William IWtus of
Petaluma and S. L. Stlce, the latttf a son
in-law of the late Farmer Church, and
who was present at the time King shot
Church.
King's Theosophical Ideas.
King In his confession to The Call re
porter to-night stated that it was not
the keenness of the officers that resulted ,
in his capture, but ascribes it to a train of
unfortunate circumstances dating from
his mother's funeral several years ago.
King Is a Theosophist, and believes in the
occult sciences.
King was brought to this city to-day
from San Francisco. He arrived In the
custody of Deputy Sheriff M. H. Goe and
Constable J. G. Clark, who captured him
near Orland. King was taken directly
to the Sheriff's office, where he sat Im
passively In a chair while a score of peo
ple gazed at him and compared him with
the pictures already published. He never
uttered a word. His bronzed and drawn
face told a tale of hardship that no words
could have conveyed. He wore a dirty
suit of old blue jeans, a pair of pointea
shoes that had seen better days, a pair
of large smoked spectacles and a slouch
hat.
Dsnies His Identity.
When placed in a cell after his arrival
he refused tcr^admit his identity or pay
any attention when addressed as King.
"Address me by my right name, if you
please. It is Charles W. Wesley." was
his answer. .-.-*
When told by Sheriff Taylor that his
wife wanted to see him a momentary
Mash of emotion passed over King's face,
but he only said, "I would like to see
my wife if I had one." Then he softly
inquired, "Is Mrs. King upstairs?"
When told that she would be sent for
he said nothing. He at first refused to be
interviewed. When told that men were
coming from the scene of the shooting to
identify him he said he didn't know them.
So well and so strangely did he act that
more than one official began to doubt that
the prisoner was the slayer. It was re
marked that the man was partly de
mented. His wild actions and rambling
statements made the officials believe for
a time that the rigors of his flight had
overcome his reason. The only request
he made was for something to eat. After
eating he would talk.rhe said. The Sheriff
furnished him with a meal large enough
for two men and King ate heartily. He
still refused to talk and the officers anxi
ously await the arrival of S. L. Stice and
William Loftus, the latter a Petaluma
deputy sheriff, who had been sent for to
identify the prisoner.
Identification.
Upon the' arrival of the men they walked
Into King's cell. They immediately nod
ded " their -" heads In affirmation that the
prisoner was King. Loftus shook King's
hand, saying. "Well, old man. they have
got you at last." A sickly smile spread
over the prisoner's face, but he said
nothing. He did not admit his identity.
Stice looked him over from head to
foot. Through it all King remained as
Impassive as the dead. Stlce is the late
Mr. Church's -son-in-law and was on the
scene of the shooting: In, fact, he claims
that King took a shot at .him- after kill
ing Church. He fully identified the pris
oner. Sheriff Grace of Sonoma also looked
at King and thought that he recognized
him.
It was learned that King registered as
O. C. Smith and wife at a Petaluma hotel
on Augusts and 12 and September 7, 189iÂ».
Confesses to a Call Reporter.
King did not break his sllenceuntil 7;30
o'clock to-night, when he was interviewed
by a Call reporter. He had evidently con
cluded to throw off the mask and clear
away the mystery of his identity. He re
fused to talk about his case and when
asked as to his travels he developed | a
commercial Instinct and stated Â¦ between
gentle laughs that he would 'write a beau
tiful story of his experiences for a con
sideration ranging between. $50 and $100.
"The story will be worth it." he' re
marked. He further said: "I am. feeling
better now." My head aches, though. The
air in the City Prison last night- was very
bad. They gave me two meals in one
here to-day." - v " :
When asked about his treatment when
arrested he said:
"Constable Clark is all right- He used
me well, but Goe was no go."
The attempted fun caused him to laugh.
When reference was made to the run h<Â»
gave the officers he could not conceal the
sense of pride that filled ' him. He said
that he could give any officer in the State
advice that would be worth $1000.
King's Queer Theory.
It developed . In . the course of the Inter
view that King is a tbeosophist. He said:
"I believe in occult science. My capture
was not brought about by the prowess of
any officer, but by a train of clrcurr.
etajices leading from my mother's funeral
two, years ago to the funeral of Mri
Clark the other day. Constable Clark
left his wife's funeral to capture King.
"I can see- it all now. When I went
over toward Paskenta I did wrong and I
knew it at the time. If I had kept on
I would now have been in the heart of
Oregon by. this time. It was. not to be,
nowever, and I am here." â¢
'.Sheriff Taylor showed him the key 'to
"his home and he asked the Sheriff how
he got it
King; is crafty and full of ingenuity.
During his flight Â¦ he would change his
shoes and clothes at least twice a day.
At the time of his capture he wore a pair
of moccasins made of cloth.: During his
trip he acted, at i various . times , the blind
man, the deaf man and the tramp. He
openly ; stated to-night that If it had not
been for the peculiar circumstances men-
tloned the officers would never have got
him. â¢ ' ; '
Talks of His Flight.
King, however, admitted that Sheriff
Taylor had him hard-pressed, more than
once and that at one time the Sheriff was
only six miles behind him. He continued:
"Taylor was coming all the time, but I
am too old a woodsman to let any officer
catch me in the mountains.'-.
King to-night enlisted the services of
Lennon & Hawkins to defend him at his
trial. He will be arraigned before Judgo
Rodden here next â¢Saturday and the pre
liminary hearing will be held next
Wednesday. His attorneys have told hint
to remain silent and he Is not the man la
disobey their instructions.. They will
hereafter do all the talking for him.

look Republicans in the face and wage
war against them in many a battle: that
he pull "Relieved it his duty to face the
Republicans, but in a different attitude;
that he had come to realize that the Re
publican party stood for progression and
patriotism, and that it was the duty of
every good citizen, irrespective of prior
convictions, to sustain the policy and ad
ministration of William ilcKinley.
Mr. Shinn further said that he had j
never in his whole life cast his vote for
tlie head of the Republican ticket, but he
proposed to do so at the approaching
election, having concluded that the
American principles put forward by the
' Republican party should be indorsed by
every patriotic citizen and the McKinley

SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 2).â When the six-,
teÂ«n Japanese prisoners who are held
here in jail awaiting the outcome of the
injuries they inflicted on the five China
men yesterday afternoon in the fierce fight
at the Novato ranch were to-day exam
ined by District Attorney Mclsaac the
men were brought up one at a time to his
office and were treated to an up-to-date
examination, wherein an interpreter from.
San Francisco and a shorthand reporter
took an active part. Mr. Mclsaac said
that the stories of the men were contra
dictory. AH of them stated that they
took no active part In the assault other
than to try to stop it.
Last night the men were separated aa
much as the facilities of the jail would
permit. .They were not allowed to talk
with their visiting countrymen. The Dis
trict Attorney says that he got some ad
missions from several that were exam
ined.
The mainstay of the prosecution in the
case will be the testimony of Miss Ethel
Green and 'Miss Alice Mansablea, who
were in the packing house at the time
and saw the commencement of ihÂ»
trouble. They say that they can identify
the men who started the trouble and used
the clubs. They are the only white wit
nesses to the commencement of the row.
To-morrow they will be sent for and
called upon to pick out the guilty men.
From the investiBation held here to-day
suspicion of the authorities has been di
rected against H. Matsutani, E. Himrae,
Y. Hlkido and W. Matsutani. The Mat
sutanls are supposed to be the men who
inflicted the terrible injuries on Ching
Fon%.
All the injured Chinese are doing well,
and Chins Fong. who it was though:
would die last night. Is still alive. Dr.
Kuzer stated that the man may recover,
but that he is in a critical condition.
Nothing will be done with the prisoners
for several days. Ex-District Attorney

Curious Warning.
Students of the occult sciences will find
an interesting occurrence In Incidents
which happened in the household of
George Jennings on Temple street, Mt
"Washington, last Saturday night just as
James Snee lest his life on. the railroad
crossing at Washington street.
The 15-year-old daughter of Mr. Jen
nings has been seriously ill for somÂ« time,
requiring constant care from her parents
and the attending physician. Saturday
evening shortly before 10 o'clock while the
young girl was resting in her room under
the care of her mother, she appeared to
lose consciousness to such an extent as
to cause alarm and the sending for the
physician. Dr. George E. Goodwin.
Suddenly she seemed to be aroused from
her unconsciousness and cried out: "Papa,
do not cross the tracks. One is enough.
You will be killed."
She rej>eated the warning cries in va
rious forms several times and then be
came quiet. Her attendants were alarmed
by her speech and actions and anxiously
awaited the coming of the physician.
Mr. Jennings was away at the time, but
returned a few minutes later, and when
he was told of the occurrence offered an
explanation which in part solved the
mystery. He had just come through 'the
street and was at the railroad crossing
when James Snee attempted to cross the
tracks and was killed. At the time he
was about to attempt the crossing also,
but somehow he was restrained. He was
a witness of the terrible accident. â Haver

quets and bouquets. If they consist of
buds or short-stalked blossoms mounted
on wire the only thing to do is to water
or syringe them "overhead" and put them
for an hour under a bell glass. But if they
are mounted on morsels of cane or bam
boo they may be simply untied and put
in water. Capillary attraction then comes
into play, the cane takes up the moisture
and transmits it to the stalks of the flow
ers, keeping them damp enough to live
for some time, though, as they do no;
actually touch the water, decay does not
set in for several days.
A capital method of warding off the
corruption that makes mignonette, asters,
stocks and some other flowers very speed
ily unpleasant is to mix with the water
in which they are placed a little sal am
moniac, four grains to the quart being
sufficient.
Another mode Is to hold the cut flowers
In the steam of hot water directly they
are unpacked, and then to put the ends
of the stalks In boiling water for two or
three minutes, cut off the parboiled ends
and place them in a vase with tepid
vater in the ordinary way. The latter
part of the treatment Is also available for
flowers that are beginning to wither a
little, though the evil day of fading can
not be long postponed.â Boston Globe.

WAYS TO REVIVE FLOWEES.
Tepid Water and Morsel of
Charcoal.
There are Beveral methods of reviving
flowers known to experts. One of the chief
reasons why they fade Is because the
stalks are bruised when they are cut or
gathered. \
The way to remedy this Is to take a
fine thread of wire and Insert It at the end
of the stems, pushing it a little way up.
Then bind round the stalk a little pad of
damp cotton or moss, arrange the flowers
In tepid water with a morsel of stick char
coal in each vnse and a few sprays of
greenery If possible, and. in a half-hour
the flowers will expand and look as If they
had only just been gathered.
In order to preserve their beauty as long
as possible,' every evening place the vase
on a stone floor, or on a . large old tray
that Cannot . be - injured : by damp, and
either syringe with lukewarm water, or
pour it over them from a small can with
a fine nose. In the morning cut about a
quarter of an Inch from each stalk and
throw away every , drop of the water, re
placing It with fresh, from which the
chill has been taken. ';
When : flowers . made : up â¢ into bouquets
are received, as they often are on birth-
OayB or other : domestic anniversaries,
they look perfectly charming to start
with, but often fade as soon as they are

The Day's Dead
Lieutenant Commander Shearman.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â Lieutenant
Commander John A: Shearman, U. S. N.,
died to-night at the Chelsea Naval'Hos
pital, Boston. He entered the service
Juno 13. 1871. >
Probably the most distinguished event
of Shearman's career in, the navy was his
heroic conduct during the Samoan hur
ricane, on March -'16, 18S9, which resulted
in the wrecking of three American men
of-war, the Trenton, Vandalia and Nipsic,
and three German men-of-war, the olga,
Adler and Eber, and the loss of 146 lives.
At the time of that disaster Shearman
was a lieutenant and the senior watch
officer of the Nipsic, Commander D. W.
'Mullan. 'At the height of the storm ; the
Nipsic was beached in front of the Amer
ican consulate at Apia and was in great
danger of being pounded to pieces by the
waves that were breaking over her. With
the assistance of the natives a nawscr
was made fast between the forecastle of
the Nipsic and a. tree on shore and by
means of this hawser, with the iurthtr
assistance of the natives, nearly all the
officers and crew of. the vessel were saved.
Shearman was the last man to leave ths
Nipsic. Commander Mullan insisted upon
being the last, but as Mullan could not
swim Shearman insisted upon placing his
commander In a ship's cask and helping
â¢him down the dangerous passage in thi
way. ; When he had accomplished/ this
Shearman climbed down the rope by his
hands. During the remainder of' the 'day
Shearman did more than any other officer
ashore to rescue the drowning men who
were washed overboard from the .sunken
Vandalia, giving directions to American
sailors and natives who were doing every
thing possible to save the men in the
water.
Rear Admiral Kimberley, in his official
report of the disaster, specially com
mended Shearman's gallant conduct dur
ing the storm.

SPEAKS FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION
NEW YORK. Aug. 29â A few days ago
Dr. Hepworth, representing the New York
Ilorald, wrote to former President Cleve
land asking for an expression of opinion
on the political situation. The following
was received in 'reply:
My Dear Dr. Hcpworthâ Tour letter is re
ceived. I am quite sure you wronsrly estimate
the value of any expression I might make con
cerning the DOlltlcal situation.
Besides. I am by no means free from the
r>erj>lexity which now afflicts thousands of I
those who love the principles of true Democ
racz: In these circumstances I am not In
clined to advise others as to their present po
litical fluty. A crisis has arisen when each
rran'n conscience and patriotic sense should be
his guide. Inasmuch, therefore, as neither cer
tainty of my ability to rightly advise, nor any
call of obligation prompts me to discuss politi
cal conditions. I think I ought to be permitted
(n my retirement, to avoid the Irritation and
abuse which my Interference at this time would
inevitably invite. Yours very truly.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
BRYAN TO TAKE THE
FIELD IN THE EAST
CHICAGO, Aug. 29.â William J. Bryan
will lead the fight of the Democrats him
self In the Central and Eastern States.
He will take command next week in Chi
cago and then begin an invasion of Re
publican territory, Â¦ for he has decided to
cede to the shores of the American continent,
become herself a little >fhina, cancel herself
as a factor in the Kreat civilizing and com
mercial change in the Asiatic Orient, an event
fully as important as the discovery of America
t>y Columbus.
Imperialism Is not the paramount issue of
the campaign and cannot be made so. The ad
justmen: of any question as to the Philippines
1b to be considered after rebellion against the
sovereignty and authority of the United States
has been pot down. The paramount issues this
year are financial and eoonimic. Shall the
anti-protection party of the 18 to 1 be put In
power to .idvance Its principles by the enor
mous powers of executive influence in case Mr.
Bryan le elected, and win the first engage
ment In a. campaign, the next battle of which
will be for the control of both houses of Con
grresy?
The question for the plain people is. do they
wish, with the Instructions of a bitter experi
ptÂ»*Â» fresh and deep in their memories, to
change cr submit to the chanpe of that abound
lnc prosperity which came -with the election
of President McKinleyâ a prosperity which no
L>r:nocratic platform cr speaker denies, nor
dare not rejoice in or even allude to. Agtiln
aldo rpn wait until the American people take
"a bond of fate" if necessary by annihilating,
for the preservation of their own domestic in
terests, the political combination which is st
the ftune time their enemy and the aider and
abettor of the Tajral rebels.
Thf Immediate duty of thin Government as to
thÂ» Philippines Is to maintain Its sovereignty
and to crush the rebelifon against it. What
itÂ« constitutional powers and limitations ere
can tie mere profitably discussed and consid
ered after th? authority of the United States
fhaJ! have hwn firmly established. I do not
believe that the constitution contains any dis
abling ir.h!hftat!nns which will prevent this
Government from governing those islands as
their l^Et interests' may demand and according
to the oar<a<itlei. of their people. No such dif
ficulties intervened In the administration of
Louisiana. Florida or the territory which we
acquired from Mexico. Congress legislated at
the last peppjon in regard to the government of
Alaska In some particulars entirely unwar
ranted by the constitution. If the disabling con
struction rlaced upon it by our opponents Is
correct.
Senator Dolltver ot Iowa was greeted
with prolonged cheers as he rose to re
spond to the toast, "Profferity and It3
Causes."
The new Senator from Iowa was given,
at the close of his speech, an ovation
which surpassed the reception that met
him before he began to speak.
DECLINES TO TALK ON
POLITICAL SITUATION
MILAX, Aug. 29.â The trial of Bresci.
the anarchist, who on July 29 shot
and killed King Humbert of Italy
at Monza while his Majesty was
returning from a gymnastic exhibition,
opened here to-day. The assassin was
found guilty and sentenced to imprison
ment for life. An immense crowd of peo
ple gathered about the court from
early morning, seeking admission to the
courtroom, where only a few places were
reserved for the ticket-holding public.
The hearing began at 9 o'clock. Bresci
sat in the dock, calm and almost indif
ferent. His counsel, Signor Martelli, head
of the Milan bar, and the anarchist writer
(Signor Merlin) made requests on various
grounds for an adjournment, which -were
refused. It is said that Bresci wrote to
the Judges declaring he would not reply
to the interrogatories.
While the Indictment, which Â¦was very
long, was being read, Bresci was appar
ently unmoved, and scanned the faces of
the audience without any signs of fear or
effrontery. The indictment showed that
the assassin indulged In Incessant target
practice and that he prepared bullets so
as to make them more dangerous.
The witnesses were then introduced â
eleven for the prosecution and five for the
defenseâ and the examination of Bresci
followed. He declared that he decided to
kill King Humbert after the events of
Milan and Sicily, "to avenge the misery
of the people and my own." He added:
"I acted without advice or accomplices."
The prisoner admitted the target prac
tice and the preparation of bullets. He
spoke in a low, firm voice and said he
fired three shots at three yards with his
revolver. Two wooden targets were here
placed on the table before the Juukp. Two
hours' suspension of the court ensued and
then tho witnesses were heard.
A brigadier of gendarmes. Salvatori. re
capitulated the story of the assassination
of the King. He said he saved Bresci
from the crowd, who nearly lynched the
assassin. Bresci, when rescued, was cov
ered with blood.
j General Avagadro des Contes di Quinto
the King's aide-de-camp, who was with
his Majesty when the latter was killed,
! recounted how the King was shot, saying
i that the King tried to reply to a question
I of the witness after the crime. HIsMa
: jesty started to speak, saying: "I truly
! think " The King stopped in the middle
i of the sentence, said "Yes" and then ex-
I pi red.
; . The testimony of Witnesses Galimbert
I and Clivers did not adduce any new facts.
The royal groom. I-upi. deposed that he
seized Bresci by the throat.
A witness named Ramella, who lodged
with Bresci and a friend three days prior
to the crime, said the prisoner was al
ways perfectly calm. The remainder of
the* witnesses did not throw any further
light on the tragedy.
The public prosecutor made a speech,
during the course of which he eulogized
tho virtues of King Humbert and recapit
ulated the story of the assassination,
which, he contended, demonstrated that
Brosci wa? fully responsible for his acts
and that the latter premeditated the
crime and had accomplices. After de
nouncing the anarchist theories which
brought about such fearful crimes
the public prosecutor denied that
Bresci had misery as an excuse,
also asserting: ""that he was not
a man of impulse or a fanatic,
but had a calm, cynical and obstinate
mind and that his aim was Infamous. In
conclusion the public prosecutor asked for
a verdict of guilty without extenuating
circumstances.
Signor Merlin said he only wished to do
his duty, and defended anarchy on the
charge that it had inspired the crime. All
partifs he declared, had their regicides,
commencing with Judith. He asked that
those in whose hands the prisoner s fate
lay would not act In a spirit of vengeance
but of justice. lie claimed extenuatins
circumstances for the accused man.
Signor Martelli asked that the verdict
be tempered "with, indulgence toward an
irresponsible man condemned 'of a crime
committed in a state- of exaltation.': Ho
spoke of Bresci's previous good conduct
and implore*plty for the guilty man.
Rresci was^given an opportunity to
spoak, and said: "Sentence me. I am in.
different. I await the next revolution."
The persons who were to deliberate on
the verdict thfn retired, but soon' decided
upon the guilt of the prisoner, and sen
tence was imposed.
' Bresci escaped with life imprisonment,
as that penalty is the most severe which
can be imposed under the laws of Italy
for murder, on which charge the anarch
ist was tried. It . was at first believed
Bresci would be tried on the charge of
treason, in* which -case the penalty would
have been death.
NEW YORK. Aug. 29.â The news that
her husband had been sentenced to life
imprisonment for killing King Humbert
of Italy was carried to Mrs. Brosci at her
home in Union Hill. N. J. When told of
the sentence she wept bitterly. When
she calmed down she said: "My poor
Gaetano! He has been tried, convicted
and sentenced in one day. That was a
great Injustice. I would rather see him
dead than have him go to prison for life.
1 know ho will not be able to stand long
the life he will have to lead in prison."
LOXDON, Aug. 29.â Lord Roberts, under
date of Belfast, August 29, telegraphs:
"Buller's advance occupied "Machado
dorp this afternoon. The enemy made a
poor stand and retired northward*, fol
lowed by Dundonald' s mounted troops,
who could not proceed beyond Helvetia on
account of the difficult nature of the
country and the enemy taking up a posi
tion too strong to be dislodged by the
mounted troops. It appears that Buller s
casualties were very few.
"French continued , the movement to
day as far as Elandsfontein, from which
he turned the enemy out with no diffi
culty. The latter retired, lea-ving quan
tities of good cooked food behind."

BERLIN, Aug. 29.â The delegation of
Germans, who recently arrived here from
the Transvaal to lodge a complaint with
the German Foreign Office regarding the
treatment of Germans there by the Brit
ish, has already been received by the For

grounds of the complaint the Foreign
Office will bring the matter to the atten

was a day for anything and everything

spened at 10:30 o'clock, and from the start j
business was pushed with energy. The i
opening session was entirely of a social j
character, and was open to the public. The i
afternoon, meeting was of an executive |
character.
Address of Welcome.
General Shaw announced that the meet- !
ing would be opened with prayer by Chap- !

mained standing during the prayer. Mayor i
Harrison then came to the front of the j
rostrum and formally welcomed the sol- j
diers to Chicago. His address was hap
pily received.
Commander in Chief Shaw of the Grand
Army replied to Mayor Harrison for the
members of his organization, expressing
the thanks of the army for the hospital- ;
Ity shown them. j
The convention reassembled at 2 o'clock j
end this time there were no preliminaries, i
The action was opened at once by General j

Durinz the year the chairman of your com

to our comrade. William McKlnley. President

is a principle to which we ought to stand com
mitted now and forever.
Reports Discussed.
When the convention met in the after
noon the first thing taken up was there
port of the pension committee. A "is
would contain, it was generally thought,
some warm statements, but there was
none. There was not in the report a spe
ciflc declaration or recommendation upon
any subject. The committee at the out
set" went at length into the history of the
work done by G. A. R. committees in ob
taining from the last Congress increases
in certain classes of pensions. It then
discussed the differences of opinion exist
ing between the Pension Office and those
members of the Grand Army who hold
the opinion that the old soldiers have not
received sufficient consideration. The re
port argued at length against the state
ments that have been made by the Pen
sion Office in reply to the original criti
cisms made by members of the Grand
Army, but offered no suggestions as to
a direct line of policy to be pursued. The
report was ordered printed and will be
the special order of business to-morrow
morning at 9 o'clock, to which hour the
convention adjourned.
After the pension committee had pre
sented its report, silver services were
presented to Adjutant General Stewart
and Past Commander Johnson by their
comrades.
The committee had taken the annual
message of Commander in Chief Shaw
under consideration and reported ap
proval of all his suggestions, with the ex
ception of that relating to the change
of date of Memorial day from May 30 to
the last Sunday in May. On this the
committee reported adversely and its re
port was adopted by the convention.
Next Meeting Place.
It is expected that the work of the en
campment will be over by to-morrow, un-
Iff? there should be a protracted debate
over the report of the pension committee,
and this is not considered probable. No
opposition has developed to Judge Rais
seur of St. Louis in his candidacy for the
position of commander in chief, and it is
practically certain that he will be elected
on the lir.Â«t vote. There has been very
little talk regarding the place of the next
encampment, but two places, Denver and
Salt I^ake. having been mentioned.
The chief feature of the programme to
morrow, outside of the business meeting,
will be a sham battle in Washington
Park, in which detachments of local mili
tia will take part.

BRESCI IS SENTENCED
TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT
DETROIT. Mich., Aug. 29.â Belle Isle
was invaded to-day by the Pythian army
in full force. ; The Knights, 9000 strong,
left their encampment on the East Boule
vard at 10 o'clock, marched \ across the
long bridge leading to the island park and
to the play ground commons on the east
erly side of the island, where the bienniai
inspection and review of. the uniform
rank was held, i The long line marched in
a column of fours down -the boulevard,
across the bridge and through the drive
ways of the island. -7-':% / . - Â¦'Â¦â¢Â¦â¢*..
After a deal of galloping about : of the
staff, brigade and regimental officers, the
inspection formation was completed, two
long lines of. troops stretching from end
to end of the great field, with the brigade
and regimental officers grouped to the
fore in their places, the artillery anri
cavalry on the left. The inspection then
proceeded, the major general and staff
moving down and up the long lines, and
appropriate salutes by officers, knights
and the numerous bands. of music.
General Carnahan then took his station
in the center. of the field, and his army
wheeled right into company front an'l
marched in review in that formation. As
the head of each brigade passed the com
mander the brigadier generals and their
staffs fell out and joined, the staff of the
major general.
The sessions "-of the Supreme- Lodge of
Knights of Pythias were resumed to-day
and some of the reports of the commit
tees were heard.
Supreme Chancellor Sample will to-mor
row announce the election by the Supremo
Lodge of James R. Carnahan of Indianap
olis as major general commanding the
uniform rank. General Carnahan found
ed the uniform rank more than twenty
years ago, and has ever since been its
commander. His salary is $4500 per year.
It now appears to be conceded that Vice
Supreme Chancellor Wethers of Wiscon
sin will be elected supreme chancellor, ac
cording to previous'cugtom, instead of the
re-election of Supreme Chancellor Sampie
being brought about. ':
Twenty-four past grand chiefs of the
Rathbone Sisters were to-day admitted to
the sessions of the supreme body of the
woman's. order,. but .without the right to
vote.
The reports of officers were read and re
ferred.
The Pythian -Sisterhood Supreme Lodge
spent most of to-day's session discussing
recommendations adopted in. the: officers"
reports.. Â¦ ; ' .
The "grand electrical and fireworks pa
rade" of the Knights of Khorassan to
night, which was announced as the spec
tacular feature of Pythian week, resulted
In a vast deal of confusion. The police
had made no â¢ arrangements for clearing
the streets along the line of march. The
picturesquely clad Khorassans were
obliged to make their way around street
cars - and through narrow lanes opened
through the crowd, and many of the elab
orately prepared humorous features were
lost to a great majority of the specta
tors.
Some 2500 of the Knights, a rollicking
branch . of the. order, took part In the
spectacle. A great many marchers car
ried' varicolored torches, others swords
and scimitars of antique Oriental pat
terns. All wore turbans or other quaint
headgear and clothes of Arabian, Persian
or Turkish cut. ' â¢. â¢
Tne high potentates rode in canopied
floats, preceded by a representation of the
mythical temple of the order. There were
several elaborate electrically illuminated
floats and many funny features.
To-morrow's principal features will be
the election of supreme officers and the
prize drills.

There is cause for anxiety when a
cough hangs on for a year and can't be
shaken off. The quickest way to relieve
that anxiety is to begin at once the use
of Dr. Pierce's. Golden Medical Discov-
ery. . It is a cough remedy, but it is also
a great deal more. In far advanced
stages of disease, when . hemorrhages
have been frequent, and there have been
emaciation and weakness, "Golden Med-
ical Discovery" has produced a perfect
cure. It increases the supply of the life
fluidâ blood. It cleanses the blood from
impurities, and sends a current of rich,
new blood to build up the weak places
in the body with new life.
The "Discovery" i9 strictly a temper-
ance medicine, non-alcoholic and non-
narcotic.
" For one year I was troubled with a cough,"
writes Mr. H. E. Curtis, of Sumner, Bremcr
Co., Iowa. "As I continued to cough during the
summer, my wife became anxious, and wrote to
Dr. R. V. Pierce for medical advice. It seemed
to us that we could not go to a better source for
advice, and so it proved, as the ' Golden Medical
Discovery,* which was -recommended, proved
just the medicine to effect a cure. Dr. Pierce
and his medicines are ' As good as wheat,' as the
farmers used to say."

WOODLAND, Aug. 29.â This was Gov
ernor's day at the district fair. Citizens
of Woodland expected that it would be
a record-breaker and they were not dis
appointed. It was a great afternoon at
the track and a great evening at the
pavilion. The attendance at both placfs
is unprecedented in the history of Wood
land fairs. The people of Yolo County
appreciate the honor conferred upon them
by a visit from Governor Gage and other
State officials and there was a general and
spontaneous movement by them to attest
that appreciation. A disposition was
shown by the people to make the occasion
one that will be remembered by the dis
tinguished guests with great pleasure.
The same commendable spirit animated
all alike. The Governor and his party
received an ovation they appreciated.
The Governor and his party arrived at
noon and were met at the depot by thu
reception committee. After a short drive
about the city the party lunched and at
1:30 o'clock drove out to the park. The
party included Secretary of State Curry.
Controller Colgan, State Equalizers
Brown Toland and Beamer, Directors
Mathews and Wilson of the Stale Board
of Agriculture, Deputy Surveyor General
W right. State Treasurer Reeves and other
State officials.
The first heat of the first race was wit
nessed from the secretary's oflico in the
judges' stand, after which the party was
escorted to the grand stand. The Gov
ernor was heartily cheered when he ap
peared and the band rendered "Hail to
the Chief."
Governor Gage visited the pavilion this
evening and made a brief speech, whlc^i
was received with enthusiasm and ap
plause. , ;
The seating capacity of the grand stand
at the track was taxed to its utmost ca
pacity The infield was crowded with
vehicles of various kinds and the betting
ring was full to overflowing. It Is a con
servative estimate to-day that there were
fully 3000 people at the park to witness the
rt After the first heat of the first race
Dione, who holds the Pacific Coast trot
ting record of 2:07V*. was brought out and
made an unsuccessful effort to lower her
record. There was a stiff breeze blowing
and the conditions were not favorable.
After scoring once the little mare got
awav She trotted all the way around
like "a perfect machine. The quarter was
made in :32. the half in 1:03. the three
quarters In I:35i4 and the mile in 2:08 flat.
Notwithstanding her failure the game lit
tle mare was wildly cheered. Driver Jef
freys announced that If conditions are
favorable on Saturday, he will make an
other effort to lower the record.
In the 2:30 trot there were seven entries.
Zarlna. the Spreckels entry, was four
Ungths behind at the start, but on the
home stretch easily closed the gap and
beat Algoneta under the wire by an open

finished third. Â»,,.,Â».
In the next heat Zarlna broke In the

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL, Washington, Aug. 23.â All ar
rangements have practically been perfect
ed by the Taft commission for commenc
ing its duties in connection with the es
tablishment of civil government In tha
Philippines, v .- f
The commission will assume on Septem
ber 1 all functions which properly belong
to the legislative branch of government.
It Is not proposed that It shall be in su
preme control.
General MacArthur will be the chief ex
ecutive of the islands and the commission
will be co-ordinate with him. just as thi
executive and legislative branches in the
United States are on the same plane.
Civil government will not be established
except in those towns where the military
authorities are satisfied there Is no danger
of insurrection. Tha commission and mili
tary will work zealously together to pro
pitiate the natives and induce them to re
turn to their peaceful avocations. For
those Insurgents who propose to continue
In arms It Is understood that there will be
measures taken for their suppression just
as soon as the dry season begins. General
MacArthur will soon have a force of near
ly 70,000 effective men, who will be used
to destroy insurgent organizations when
operations can begin. Iii view of the fore
going, given out to-day by an official of
the administration who Is familiar with
the instruction sent the Philippine com
mission, it Is evident there is no foundation
for the report that Aguinaldo's represen
tative In I^ondon has a cablegram stating
that General MacArthur and Mr. Taft
have been authorized by the President to
declare that civil government will be
granted the Filipinos In September and
ultimately statehood. It is the belief of
the official who discussed the matter that
the report grew out of the Intention of the
commission to establish a civil government
wherever It Is feasible from a military
point of view.
General MacArthur and the
Civil Government Will Be Established
Whenever the Authorities Are
Satisfied There Is No Dan
ger of Insurrection.

starting at the great Jubilee State Fair
meeting the directors of the Agricultural
Society have picked a turfman well and
favorably known to horsemen the country
over. For nearly eighteen years "Pat,"
as he is familiarly termed, has been asso
ciated with James B. Ferpuson, acting
either as assistant starter or wielder of
the front flag. During the. season of 1898
Reagan sent the runners away at the
Great Falls, Mont., and Boise. Idaho,

work. At the Denver meeting this year
he dispatched both the harness and run

diana and entries from the leading live
stock farms of Nevada. The agricultural
features will be given special prominence
this year. There will be a fine show of
stock, including Percherons from France;
Clydesdales*; imported coach horses; Berk
shires from England; Poland China hogs,
purchased from herds in the East,
which had won prizes at the
World's Fair; Rambou'.ette sheep,
imported direct from Paris; Jerseys; Hoi
steins from Holland, and poultry from
every section of the State.

THERE was an entry made on the
register at the California Hotel last
night by a newly married man. This
was evident by the fond way in
which the pen had sputtered as It traced
the words "and wife." The entry waa
made by a man who has been for two
score years a â¢ gay bachelor. Jesse G.
Gobey, whose oyster parlors at 228 Sutter
strtet have been an epicurean landmark
to a generation of San Franciscans, is
the man. and Miss Augustlna De,sroches
of Woonsocket, R. L, was the name worn
by his bride before tho wedding march
was played. Behind that entry on the
hotel register lies a little romance of the
kind which Is chewed v.ith caramels In
the young ladles' seminary but which few
of his friends would have suspected Go
bey of indulging in. The latter, however,
has. dosnite the hardening effect of it
cruel world, nourished a heart tender as
asphalt In summer. Mr. Gobey fell in
love, with a picture. A picture of a gir:.
Brunette and dainty of feature. Fell In
love with It some time la*t year when he
saw it in the album of his friend Ad-
lard F. Martel, at 610 Bush street. Such
an impression did tha photographic fea
tures make on Gobey that he found out
the original's acMre.-Â«s. j.ut a flower In his
coat and a fiercer twist In his mustache
and went and got snapped himself. Th*
result was wrapped up, stamped and ad
dressed to Miss Desrtches. Gobey re
ceived a note of acknowledgment and, of
course, he replied.
Some time ago Jesse bade his friends
"au revoir" and with his sister. Miss El
mira Gobey. as chaperon he went to vsit
his brothers, who by an odd coincidence
resided at Woonsocket. R. I. For a few
weeks the air -\t Woonsocket was electric,
and then the picture lovers metat thehouse
of Dr. Bertchiaume. When introduced
they bowed demurely enough, but as Go
bey said last r.Ight he knew It was the
lady of the photograph and she recognized
the original of the picture from California.
They were married two weeks apn and
have leisurely traveled out to California,
stopping In Chicago and Denver.
When soen in their rooms last night a
happier looking couple than Mr. and Mrs.
Gobey would have been hard to find. Mrs.
Gobey says she's glad she sent her pic
ture to the Martels, and Mr. Gobey says
he's more than glad he saw it.

"I have seen all the oil fleld3 In Amer

though it might prove the greatest pro

reservations and I concluded also to taka
a look at the Kern oil fields. The oil In
dustry on this coast is becoming a great
Industry and it is our duty to give it all
the protection possible, that It may flour

put their money into the industry get fair
play. We do not propose to have them
Interfered with by dishonest schemers. IC
the land is mineral we propose to have It
reserved for mineral location and develop
"I took the field and found oil Indica

Indications right where the oil la being
pumped. With what information I have
obtained by this visit I will be qualified to

Short-Enders Receiving the
Distinction of the Judge's
Flag.
F. A. McComb's Motto captured the
midweek reserve stake of sixty-four dogs
run at Union Coursing Park yesterday
morning and afternoon. The deciding
course between Motto and Pasha Kennels'
May Hempstead was the most interesting
and exciting one of the day. Motto's vic
tory was hard-earned, the score, 7â6, be
ing indicative of the character of the race.
Motto led up to the hare and scored the
first turn. After this it was nip and tuck
to the far end of the park, where the
hare made its escape.
The betting opened with Motto a 2 to 1
favorite, but the odds lowered to 3 to 2
before the bell buzzed. The favorites had
their game quarried pretty much all the
day, a few 1 to 2 shots winning- in the
several rounds.. The surprise of the day
was the white Hag in the Athena-Record-
Ing Angel course. Athena was 1 to 7.
Â¦Long courses were the' rule yesterday.
This was due to the hares, which were
very strong and fast.

NE"v7 TORK, Aug. 29.â I am
stronger rtnd healthier to-day than
I have been in a long time. I am
just e.a good a fighter as I ever was,
and 1 am quite sure that McCoy,
who now has doubts on that score,
Â¦will be convinced to my way of
thinking before we finish our little
bout. JAMES J. CORBETT.
NEW YORK, Aug. 29.â I am
faster with my hands and feet, just
as clever In every way as Corbett
and can strike a much harder blow.
I believe that I will have no trouble
in defeating the former heavy
weight champion, and venture the
prediction that I will do the trick
inside of ten rounds.
CHARLES (KID) McCOY.
NEW YORK. Aug. 29.â Few wagers
have been placed on Corbett or McCoy,
and leading Judges of things pugilistic
are about evenly divided regarding the
chances of two. of the most scientific pu
gilists of the age. Many McCoy men
want odds, and betting may be 10 to 8 at
the nngahJe.
Corbett and McCoy finished their train
ing for the battld to-day. McCoy put on
the finishing touches of his preparations
Bt Saratoga and announced at the conclu
sion of his day's work that he was fit to
:igfct. lie weighs tea pounds more than
he ever has beiore and is satisfied that if
he is beaten it will not be duo to lack of
condition.
McCoy will leave Saratoga- for this city
to-morrow morning.
"I am Caster u-jtn my hands and feet,"
paid McCoy, "just as clever in every way
a^ Corbett aj.d will have no trouoie in
defeating the former heavy-weight cham
pion, ana venture the prediction 1 will do
me trick Inside of ten rounds."
Since he began training Corbett has
taken en considerable weign-t, and he will
enttr the ring weighing llfj pounds, which
is t-ig-ht pounds heavier than his. highest
fighting weight heretofore. Every muscle
that will be brought into play by the for
mer champion ha* been t-horoug-hiy
trained and developed.
Corbett says that the youthful Hoosler
has Dover fought a really big, clever man
during his career as a pugilist. According
to Corbett. the only clever man McCoy
ever met was Choynski. and the Cailfor
nian nad him almost out when the Kid's
fate came to his rescue.
"McCoy,*- added Corbett, "is a good,
hard puncher and a dangerous man on
account of his hitting power, but I think
my ability to feint and sidestep will
greatly bother the Kid and give me an
opportunity to score blows that will event
ually cause his defeat. 1 am stronger and
rualthier to-day than I have been In a
Ions time. My battle with Jeffries con
vinced me that I am just as good a fighter
as 1 ever was, and I am Quite sure that
Mct'oy, who now has his doubts on that
score, will be converted to my way of
thinking before we finish our little bout
at Madison-square Garden to-morrow
r.icht."
Corbett said If he defeats McCoy he will
endf-avor to arrsr.ge another battle with
Jeffrie* for the heavy-weigrht champion
fhip of the world.
The Kid Says He Is Confident of
Defeating the Former Cham
pion Inside of Ten
Bounds.
Betting Is Very Light,
With Odds About
Equal.

of the Redding Primary School, requested

ed. In one night she had been admitted
to the department, passed all the stages

Deane asked and received a leave of ab

It is such methods as these through

Miss Cleary, an Unassigned Teacher,
Â¦ Explains the Board of Educa
tion System.
Miss E. B. Cleary, one of the twenty
seven teachers who at the Monday even-
Ing meeting of the Board of Education
was plnced on the unassigned list with
out pay, is collecting School Board sta
tistics and atthe same time trying to ar
range in chronological order the many
and various positions she has occupied
In the School Department. All this she
is 'doing In the vain hope that thereby
she . may glean a faint idea of . the gov
erning system of the Board of Education,
and perhaps at the same time discover
where she Is at.
. Miss Cleary was appointed February 23,
1S98, and assigned a regular class at the
Douglas School. After Â¦ teaching six
months she war. consolidated out by the
Bergerot board and placed on the unas
signed list without pay. Two weeks later
Miss Cleary was" put ' on the substitute
list and continued on that list till Mon
day evening, when" President Mark's
board put her back again with the unas
signed teachers.
Miss Cleary feels she has not been fair
ly treated by the board and Is not: averse
to stating just how she feels In the mat

- . "I . do not consider that we have been
fairly treated," said Miss Cleary yester
day, "and when I say 'we' I mean all of

rules the board has adopted in the matter.
First it was, decided that the younger

PRF^IDENT CECIL W; MARK
OF THE BOARD OP EDUCA
TIONV>AXD THE LADY WHO
HAS -A'. REMARKABLE RECORD
OF PROMOTION IN THE DE
PAKTMENT.
It appears unfortunate that she who is
an estimable . woman and admittedly
"apable should serve as an example to
Illustrate the dishonesty with which
President Mark and his associates are
treating the teachers of the department.
Until a month and five days ago Mrs.
Steele was a special teacher of general
history In the department. She was In the
same category as other special teachers,
such as those of cooking and physical
tiilture, and -subject to the whim of the
boa'rd as far ."is her tenure of office was
concerned. She could be discharged at
will and in July was dismissed on the
score of economy. For rive years she haa
been a demonstrator with the stereopti
con. and the board decided that it could
no longer stand the expense of her em
ployment.
This assertion was simply one of the
subterfuges which has angered the teacn
ers by palpable dishonesty of methods.
Mrs. Steele was awarded her salary for
July, which Is vacation month, and during
which she did not work. On July 23 she
was elected a substitute in the regular
department. At that very time the School
Board was consolidating teachers out, of
the department on the ground that their
services were not needed, and they should
not receive salary. Schools were being
upset, instructors were being degraded at
the very time when President Mark per
fected his scheme.
But he had not by any means com
pleted his plan. When one plays favorites
there" seems to be no half measure for
success. It was not President Mark's
purpose to leave Mrs. Steele on the sub
stitute list. That list was already com
plete, and teachers on it were in immi
nent danger of being relegated to the un
assignl-d list through the consolidation of
classes In schools. But President Mark
had provided for the emergency.
Mark's Fraud Upon the Teachers.
When the present Hoard of Education
assumed its duties a definite system of
promotion for teachers was in operation.
The previous board had reorganized the
department after the scandalous actions
of its predecessor. Teachers were as
signed to. the unassigned and substitute
lists chronologically In the order of their
appointment to the department. This ap
peared to be the only reasonable, just
method of. placing teachers In the depart
ment and was accepted without protest.
The present board, however, discovered
a way in which to provide for Its favor
ites and add to the discontent and sense
of Injustice, which was already rampant
in the department.
â¢It decided that teachers should not, bÂ«
promoted ; according to the date of their
entrance into the School Department. If
this had been done 1 Mrs.. Steele would
have been the last' on the unassigned Use
and wouid have been compelled to pro
gress slowly through the unassigned list,
then into the substitute, list and finally
into the. regular department as vacancies
In the regular, roll occurred. This is a se
rious process, as some (f the young wom
en who have been on the substitute list
for years and are forced to submit' to such
favoritism as the Steeje case Illustrates
can testify. The present board had made
tho way easy for favorites. On July 23
Mrs. Steele- was dismissed as a special
teacher. A few .minute* ** later she was
elected a substitute in the department
and a few minutes aftorthat she was as
signed to the Redding, Primary School "at
the request of the principal." The Job
was complete. The joker In the -whole
affair was the significant phrase "at the
request of the principal." which has
given to the board the.* opportunity to
care for favorites at the expense of every
one else. : .
Discipline of the Department De-
stroyed.
When this board assumed office 'it abol- :
ished the rule wh.lch provides 'that pro
motion in v the department ; shall i be made'
according to the date of appointment. Â¦: In
a single sentence the board destroyed! the
discipline of the department and declared
that promotions shall : be made ."'at '. the
request .of the - principal." ; Mark ; and his
associates claimed that greater efficiency^
THE maladministration of the local
"Board of Education has reached a
certain climax where the Indigna
tion of the teachers, who are 'sub
jected to the grossest discrimina
tion, and of the public, which is being
forced to see the department demoralized,
is taking the definite form of protest. The
present Board of Educatfon has eclipsed
all others in the palpable dishonesty of
jtp proceedings. It has degraded teachers
of long standing in the department to
make way for the election of favorites,
who have been chosen in the secrecy of
star-chamber meetings. It has destroyed
the mÂ°rit system of promotion for teach
ers and has substituted that of a political
pull.
It has overthrown the system of grada
tion established by its predecessors and
supplanted it by a scheme In which prin
cipal? of schools are expected to carry out
the shady plans of the board. An absurd
classification has been adopted in the face
of a united protest from parents, teachers
and educators. Children have been
crowded into classrooms like cattle, in or
der that consolidations might be made and
provision In the department for favorites
might be Insured. An absurd course of
study, based upon university methods, ha?
been adopted and forced upon pupils and
teachers alike.
Wherever possible Eastern educators
have been smuggled into the department
to the cost of local teachers, notably in
the physical culture department. Thou
sands of citizens have protested against
this high-har-dr-d proceeding and have
been told by the board to attend to their
own affairs. Under the mask of economy
the greatest extravagance has been in
dulged, particularly in the cooking depart
ment, reorganized to make provision for
friends of President Cecil W. Mark of^the
board. The result of all this upheaval
has been a demoralization of the depart
ment, unrest and apprehension among the
teachers and chaos among the children.
Meanwhile, under the rlngleadershlp of
Mark, the board continues its schrmes to
destroy the efficiency of tbe department.
Smuggled Into the Dapartment.
The affair has reached such a pass that
some of the teachers who have been dis
turbed in their positions and reduced, in
rank and salary are preparing to take
action in the courts and to make a united
petition to Mayor Phelan to call a halt
from the members of the School Board,
who are his official creatures.
After the School Board had upset prece
dents, destroyed the stability which t had
marked the tenure of teachers, con
solidated classes, overcrowded schools,
weighted with useless courses of study
every grade in the department and se
cretly installed favorites some of the
teachers bogan an inquiry and learned
some of the startling secret schemes of
the board, manipulated under the leader
ship of Mark.
One of the cases which attracted notice
ami which serves to indicate,, the manner
In which the School Board is providing
for its favorites at the expense of othere
is that of Mrs. Hattio B. Steele. This'
lady has been a member of the regular
department for one month and five days.
While other teachers have been degraded
from positions which they have held com
petently and securely for years. Mrs.
Stceie has had the honor of being elected
to a regular position within one week
after she was admitted to the depart
ment.
While young women have been waiting
years in patience on the substitute list for
a permanent place in the department Mrs.
Steele, by the favor of President Mark,
passes directly and at once through the
stages of the unassigned, substitute and
probationary into a regular position.
While many teachers have been consoli
dated out of schools and deprived of their
positions Mrs. Steele has been quietly in
stalled In the -Reddinc Primary. How
many more such cases are. hidden in the
records of the "reform" board ls now a
matter of inquiry by the leachers. who
resent the discrimination from which they
are suffering.

A Splendid Musical Programme Will
Be Rendered at St. John's Ba

The attendance at St. John's bazaar Ia3t
night was the largest there has been
this week. All through the evening the
main hall wa3 thronged by crowds of peo
ple all trying to outdo oachother in tak
ing chances in raffles for everything under
the sun â In fact from a chance on a ton
of coal to a ticket in the rattle for a grey
hound pup.
A number of the priests from other par
ishes paid the fair a visit last night.
Father Quinn of St. Brigid's parish came
early in the evening and went right down
the line, buying something in every booth.
Father Harkett was a close second in
spending money in the good of the cause.
He was surrounded all the tlrre he was In
the fair by a bevy of pretty girls, who
were trying to dispose of their raffle
tickets.
To-night the Sacred Heart orchestra
Â¦will render a splendid .programme. The
orchestra will be under the direction of
Brother Hosea. It is more than possible
that there will be also some fine vocal
selections by some of the best musical
talent in the city. At the close of the
concert there will be a hop and a general
good time. . .
If you wish to visit the fair, to-night will
be one of the great nights. Take a Mis
sion-street (yellow) car and it will take
you to the gates of old St. Mary's Col
lege. ,A visit to the bazaar will insure
you a good night's enjoyment and you
will at the same time be assisting: in the
cause of charity.
SAYS CITY TAX RATE
MUST BE READOPTED
Attorney Lloyd Informs the Auditor
That Statute Must Be
Obeyed.
Auditor Wells was informed by his at
torney. Reuben H. "Lloyd, yesterday that
the city tax rate of $1,127 mutt be re
adopted on the third Monday in Septem
ber, in order to comply with the State
law. ThiÂ« opinion is in conformity with
ihat heretofore he'd by the Auditor.
v 1 it h t\a^ published In detail two weeks
ago. Mr. Lloyd also explained his views
to Supervisor McCarthy, who happened
to bo in the Auditor's office at the time.
KÂ° .-:.i'l that if the city rate wire â¢ not
adopted <m the tame day as the State rate
1>> !h? Board of Supervisors it would be
a violation of the statute, and the fact
might l.o taken advantage of by shirking
taxpayers to challenge the validity of the
â¢ax levy, and thus involve the Â«*ity In
er.Â«!le.'-s litigation. This view Is also <n
accord with that of John A. Russell, clerk
61 the Board of Bnpcrrifors.
Auditor W'plls v. - ill send a communica
tion to the board n^xt Monday outlining
hi* vims <>n the subjt-ct and also suijjrest
ing that an apportionment be made out
Â¦ ? the Increased revenue of scmo J250.001
fc'hich wi'l romo from Â¦ highor assessment
rÂ»l! than was originally estimated. This
will r.iisÂ» tl>e several film's to a consider
able figure, as the money will be divided
pro rata amonc thrm ncror>iin? to the
various sffrreieatinns of the tax rate.
T.Jayor Phelan contends that the charter
la supreme tn th*Â» ?ta.re law in rejrard to
the living of the city tax rate. That in
f-trumf-m provide? for its adoption in
June, which has been done. The Mnyor
that the charter framer- .-T'a^jed it
in thai way so that thÂ° appropriations for
the various denurtrnents could be made
before the beginning of the new fiscal
year. Instead of thrr-o months later as
formerly.

Will Notify Directors He Will Not
Audit Demands for Plumbing in
Franklin and Buena Vista
Structures.
The Board of Education has again run
cfoul of Auditor Wells in its persistent
course of ordering repairs ' to school
houses, which the official holds are under
the special charge of the Board of Pubjic
Works by a specillc provision of the
charter. The Auditor's attention was
called yesterday to the resolution passed
at the last meeting of the School Board,
in which the secretary was directed to
invite bids for the reconstruction of the
plumbing in the Franklin Grammar and
liiiena Vista schools and to perform such
ciner work as the sanitation may require.
It the board proceeds to earn' out the re
pairs Auditor Wells says he will withhold
the demands for the work and thus bring
the controversy to an Issue.
The repairs are ordered by the School
Board under a mutual agreement with
the Board of Works, but Auditor Wells
Fays that surh a procedure is clearly 11
legaJ. He will send a communication to
the Board of Eduration calling attention
to the provisions of the charter and noti
fying it that unless the law is complied
Â¦with he will refuse to flgn the demands
for any r<]>airs which arc not done under
the supervision of the Board of Works.
The Board of Education may also come
in conflict with thÂ«> Health Department
regarding th*" plumbing to bo done in the
two pchonls r.ame<l. Health Officer O'Brien

came to the matter of appointing me Miss
Jones was- told that it could not be done
because her request had been verbally
made instead of being: formally presented
in writing. Miss Jones thereupon made
a written request, but she was denied the
privilege of selecting her teacher. Mls3
Harney, who was consolidated out o*
Stanford School, was put In the place, and
the explanation offered was that the con
solidated teachers of the present board
must take preference In matter of ap
pointment."
According: to Miss Cleary Mrs. C. R.
Pechln made a request that Miss Lucile
O'Connell be appointed to fill a vacancy
in her school. Miss' O'Connell tilled the
position for a month and then was re
called rind Miss Amy Cookson, one of
Mark's consolidated teachers, was put in
her place. The month, that Miss O'Con
nell served she received substitute pay â
that is $2 50 per day. Miss Cookson wa?
given regular pay, which amounts to con
siderably more. Mrs. P. Ostrom and Mis*
Madge Dowllng are two other teachers
who, according to Miss Cleary. had to
make way for the proteges of President
Mark.
"Do you call that system?" asked Miss
Cleary, after citing the aforesaid cases.
"I don't. I call it favoritism."
The fact that the board claims consoli
dation is a matter, of necessary economy
is a subject '. productive of much amuse
ment to Miss Cleary.
"They talk of economy," said the d 1 *-

they make places for thirty special in

Of gas.
"I wonder." said Miss Cleary, in con
clusion., "whether yfit can really be true
that the board Is standing In with the

Peruna is a specific for hay fever and
should be taken during the w.iole season
of the exposure to the cause: for, as Ions?
as the exeltinc cause remains, no cure
can be permanent. People who are unable
to change their location during the season
of hay fever will find Peruna a priceless
benefit to them, as it meets every disa-
greeable symptom exactly. It is always
advisable to begin the use of Peruna -\
week or two before the expected attack
of hay fever In old cases, where the at-
tack can be foreto'd, as this n-ill often

A ROAST FOR CALIFORNIA.
ONE of the oddest campaign documents for
Bryan that has appeared up to this time is a
work bearing the title, "Why a Rich Yankee
Did Not Settle in California." It purports to be
written by Addison Awes Jr. of Gloucester, Mass., a
gentleman who to his name appends the information,
"Son of a revolutionary sire." Whether there be such
a man, we know not. The book reads like a sandlot
utterance of defiance to California and a hurrah for
Bryan.
Of our social conditions the writer says: "This free
and easystyle extends into society. No gathering, how
ever select, where you will not be surprised to see
some personage present who in New England would
be considered unfit for decent society. Men who arc
libertines are there and are permitted to associate with
pure-minded maidens, whom these wretches would
ruin the moment they are in their power. The boor,
if he only has wealth, can enter the drawing-room and
be received with as much cordiality as the president
of a college. Thus the extremes meet and mingle and
the standard lowers year by year until the true aristo T
crat becomes a hermit, feeling that to mingle with such
a motley crowd is not only a waste of time, but has a
tendency to immorality and vice that offends the sen
sibilities of a true gentleman."
Of our business opportunities it is said: "It takes
more hard work, tact, economy, skill, industry and
brains to transact and develop business in the Golden-
State than elsewhere in the great marts of trade.
The competition is very severe, unjust and bitter;
the chances of success are getting smaller, and' the
cliances of defeat greater and greater. One cause, of
this is the large number of one-lunged business men
who wander to these shores in search of health. The
genial climate revives their drooping spirits and they
resolve to stay at all hazards; so they enter into busi
ness circles and reduce or destroy fair profits â for all
they care for is to live, not to accumulate."
Upon the conditions of labor the writes quotes and
indorses the statements of one whom he describes
as "a man who was for months traveling in California
and whose opportunities for close observation were
unusually good." This authority, among other
things of a'similar purport, says: "Farm' labor is at
a Jow figure. The price for the privilege of eating
indifferent fare, 'sleeping in a strawstack and pur
ting in fourteen hours a day following a mule team is
$20 per month. During the hard times of President
Cleveland wages on farms were $25 or. $30 a month.
Indications are that this winter wages will go to $15
a month."
So from subject to subject the author goes on de
picting the miseries of the poor and the villainies of
the rich in California. The bar, the bench, the Legis
lature and the merchants of the State are equally spit
ted and roasted. However we are not left to despair.
are told there is yet a chance for the redemption
of California. The writer says a "second Lincoln has
appeared." I The name of the hew comer is Bryari,"and
his election is predicted as a necessary ste"p_ioward
the relief of the people of California from the corrup
tion engendered by the domination of the Southern
Pacific Railroad. , . .
It will be seen that we are in a hard fix,- for even
were all the evil written of us true, we should still
fall from the frying pan into the fire should Bryan
triumph. Whether the book will prove an effective
campaign document may be doubted, but it .will amuse
Californians.\ Unfortunately it may have ah injurious

THE QUESTION OF APATHY.
SENATOR HANNA in a recent address at As
/bury Park renewed the warnings which have
been, uttered time and again of the danger of
overconlidence to the Republican party. The people
appear to be so sure of the re-election of McKinley
that they feel no impulse toward entering upon an
active campaign. Thus something like apathy pre
vails in quarters where there should be alertness and
enerjry and it is evident that unless something occur
to rouse the sanguine supporters of prosperity they
may be even foolish enough to remain away from the
polls on election day and thus lose, if not the Presi
tiency. at least enough Congressional districts to give
the Bryanites control of the House of Representa-
The dullness of the campaign is not unnatural.
.The prosperity of the time js so abundant and so gen
eral and the contrast between the conditions of the
..country :to-day and those of 1896 is so strongly im
-?;presf-ed upon the public mind that there seems hardly
any possibility of the election of a calamity candidate
for the Presidency this year. Then there is the further
ff.ct that, the issues of this campaign are in the nature
of '"-wheat that has been well threshed over. The
krone? question is no i jnger ne.v. There is no further
. need of a campaign of education on the subject. The
.excellence of the gold standard has been proven by
experience and the folly of free silver fully demon
strated; To go over the arguments on the subject is
much like repeating a twice-told tale and the people
nei longer care to hear it. Thus, with a sure feeling
fifjvictory and an already established conviction con
cerning the issues at stake, there is, of course, a
natural tendency on the part of the voters to take the
suhimer as coolly as possible and leave the work of the
cajnpaign for a later date.
While that feeling iÂ« easily understood, it is never
theless a -dangerous one. and Senator Hanna was quite
justified in devoting; a considerable portion of his ad
dr^s! to the task of lousing Republicans to the duty
of [active campaign work. The issue at stake is that
of [prosperity and good government under McKinley
oridi^astcr and administrative radicalism under Bryan.
The stakes are so important that no man ought to be
â¢ \vi|lirjg to take any chances on them. Prosperity
.cbtnes, of course, from industry applied to fields,
forests and mines and is largely dependent upon na
tural conditions, but none the less good legislation is
required to enable men to reap the reward of their
labor: Bad legislation will min all that nature gives
and leave a country wretched in the midst of condi
tions that should have provided abundance for all.
In commenting upon this phase of the subject, Sena
tor Har.na said:
I want to point out to you an object lesson. Go back
to the midst of the prosperity and happiness that pre
vailed in 1S92. Then furnaces were blazing, spindles
were spinning, business was hurrying us back and
forth. You wanted a change and you got it. Well '
whnt was it? I need not picture how fires went out In
the furnaces, how Fpindlea failed to spin, how 'unem
ployed men went hungry, how' happiness disappeared
how bad went to worse. It was deplorable. Well you
wanted another change, and you got it. What a
change! Furnaces are glowing, spindles are singing
their song. Happiness came to us all with prosperity
Do you want another change, to get back to '23-$:''
Of course, you don't. Well, you must work to nre"
vent it. .' â¢-Â¦-% ; T-
There -Is the whole thing in a nutshell. If the in
dustri.cius and thrifty people of this country do not
v.tsh torpturn to the hard times of the second Cleve
land administration they must work to prevent it. To
that end they should at once take part in the political
activities of the time. Every citizen should register.
, AIlAvho ere young and strong enough to do campagin
.wj'rk should â¢ enroll in a Republican club. Repub-
Ijcsr.s'.ol California should set an example to those of
- tf.eV- East. Indifference may result in defeat. Vinr
and Vigor will assure victory.

The reports of the commercial and sav
ings banks of this city and the interior
of the State show a wonderful Increase
In gains of deposits during the past yea*".
In. fact, the reports forwarded to the State
Bank Commissioners show that all classes
are In a prosperous condition. Last week
The Call published that the footings of
the city savings banks showed a gain In
deposits of $7,186,713 71. Yesterday the re
ports of the outside savings banks were
compiled and they show a gain In de
posits of $5,037,5S5 34 during the last
twelve months. Thus the total gains of
this class of banks in the State has been
the remarkable sum of $12,224,299 05. When
it is remembered that tnese deposits were
made by the. laboring people, the well-to
do class and the farmers it is readily seen
that the country is not going to the dogs
as some of the Bryanite politicians would
have the public believe.
.The city commercial banks, where the
capitalists transact most of their business,
do not show such large returns, although
the gain in deposits in these institutions
since the last report in .August, 1899,
reached the no small figure of $1,430,163 12.
The reports of the city commercial and
country savings banks are as follows:

S INGE 4 the departure of the Shah of
Pe.-sia for Ostend the Paris papers
arni filled with qurious anecdotes
abiut him and his suite duringtheir
strfy here.
i II. is said that while constraining
himself to use a fork on state oc
casions the Shah whenever eating away
Â¦ from Europeans or official dignitaries pre
ferred to .employ his fingers in dealing
with the meats and salads.
;. Another story told of him is that he
Â¦caused hjÂ« Persian servants to be flogged
daily for the least offense and once
>ven ordered one who had upset a candle
stick on -the table, burning the Shah's
hand slightly, to be decapitated. French
advisers ljad great trouble in making the
Eastern jJuler understand that he must
refrain from such practices.
BOUGHT TWO TONS OF CANDY.
Among the Shah's remarkable purchases
and one an expert photographer, were
sent to Teheran to await his return.
The Shah and the Grand Vizier ara
known to have bought more than 150
women's dresses of the most fashionable
and costly varieties.
SPENT Jl.600,000.
The Figaro says that the cost of the
Shah's purchases while he was here was
more than $1,600,000.
When the Shah and bis Persian colony
vacated the sumptuous mansion provided
by the French Government for visiting
royalty it was found necessary to thor
oughly clean the entire establishment.
Many priceless tapestries, carpets and
pieces of furniture were ruined.
The Shah took but one bath during: his
stay and that was scalding hot and not
for the sake of cleanliness, but to allay
rheumatic pains.
During his visit the Shah decorated 240
people, including Cheiro. the American
palmist, who predicted the attempted
shooting of the Shah four days before th<Â»
event.
The thing that bewildered the Shah
more than all the other wonders that he
saw was the affection of the European
husband for his one wife, even long after
age had rendered her unattractive. At
an official banquet given to the Shah by
President Loubet the Asiatic monarch
critically surveyed the low-necked mat
rons around the table, almost all middle
'agred wives of high personages, and then
remarked bluntly to General Parent, who
sat next to him: "I can't understand why
you retain your attachment for
women, and especially why you
brinir them out when they have
reached such an advanced age. In my
harem all the women are young."
The papers say that he engaged two
young and pretty women acrobats whom
he noticed at the Hipj>odrome Circus to
perform later at his palace and mat five
French girls, four of whom were dancers
was more than two tons of French can
dies, principally sugar almonds, which
he munched at the rate of a pornd a day
after his discovery of these dainties at a
confectioner's.
Spent $1,600,000 and Bought Everything in
Quantities From Salads to Automobiles.
MUNCHED A POUND A DAT OF SUGAR AL

THE "EURNING" ISSUE.
WILLIAM E. SMYTHE in his address at Los
Angeles upon the work of the California
Water and Forest Association wittily and truly
described our. forests as the' "burning" issue of the
time. They are burning right along throughout the
year. Sometimes the burning is lawful and sometimes
unlawful, sometimes it is the result of design and
sometimes of criminal carelessness, sometimes it is
mere wastefulness of material and sometimes it is de
liberate destruction done with malice.
For the purpose of undertaking a campaign of edu
cation on the subject and promoting a scientific sys
tem of forest protection the Water and Forest
A'ssociation has been organized. In speaking of it,
Mr. Smythe said:
No mystery surrounds. Its -origin or purpose. There
Is absolutely no politics in the movement. We have no
party but the Water and Foresf Association, no candi
date save irrigation, but we do insist that. to make Cali
fornia ready for the future millions and, worthy of her
high destiny is "the paramount issue" of Â¦ the hour.
What we want is at lea'at 25,000 members,' drawn . f rom
all parts of the State and every walk in life. Our mem
bership committee, with Chief Justice Beatty at its
head, is pushing the enrollment, and already it- mounts
to thousands. We raised â¢ over $10,000 . through our
finance committee, and in the autumn will 'be able to
present the results of its expenditure in thV form of
expert reports exhibiting the workings' of .oar present
laws in relation to some of the most important streams
of our State. 'y
It is, of course, gratifying to learn that so much has
been accomplished by the association and', that its
membership is already so. strong. The. protection of
forests, however, is one of the movements, of which
it may be said that nothing can be accounted done so
long as anything remains undone. The people of the
State should give a cordial support to the association
by joining its ranks, contributing to its funds and
assisting in its work. We ought to .have something
in the way of effective legislation on the subject this
winter and to. that end every one who takes an'intelli
gent interest in the prosperity, of the State- ought to
exert whatever influence he has. . .
The time is propitious' for presenting the claimsot
the association upon the people. Fires are occurring
in all parts of the State and follow one. another with
rapidity. Some of them have been so disastrous as
to convince the occupants of the districts over which
they swept that forest preservation can never be so
costly to taxpayers as forest destruction. The issue
ought to be discussed throughout the State while we
are electing members to the Legislature. ' Let us send
to Sacramento this winter a set of men who willihave
sufficient statesmanship .to understand the importance
of this problem and the right methods of dealing
with jt'^j^S: ; x$J>* '.'','Â¦ ...
ADMISSION DAY FUND.
ADMISSION dayis now so near at hand that
the thrill of the coming celebration can be felt
throughout the city. It is to be an occasion
memorable in our -annals and will doubtless draw to
I the city one of the largest throngs that ever gathered
here. The decoration of the city is to be profuse,
artistic and splendid. <In short the festival will be in
every respect worthy of the jubilee year of the Golden
State. ' ; Â¦* ' Â¦'" . Â¦
'< Contributions 8 for the, celebration, fund, have been
liberal in most instances. The Market-street Railway
corporation has not given so much as it should, but
then that is the way of the hog and by this time we
are used to it. A$ a rule the response to the appeal
for a local contribution of $50,000 has been gener
ous and when all "is over it will be found that San
Francisco has done her full share in providing for
the State jubilee, j
There are, however, a considerable number of citi
zens who have not yet subscribed to the fund. Many
of them have .doubtless. overlooked the matter in the
msh of their private business.. Others perhaps have
not given the subject the consideration it merits.
These people should now act. The time is getting
short and if they- are to have a hand in the celebra
tion and give help to the work they should do so at
once. . Â¦'.. '. 'Â¦ ' ' : ' " i-;>i.
The issue appeals to the business and the bosoms
of men, for it is one of patriotism and of advertising.
It is to celebrate the greatness of the State and to
make known to capitalists and to home-seekers the
rich opportunities that wait upon industry and enter
prise in every section of the commonwealth. In a
movement of this kind all are expected to take part.
If each gives in proportion to his means none need
give much. When the celebration begins arid the
city is radiant with banners and thronged .with proud,
patriotic and happy people, those who have had
sufficient spirit to do their share in providing- for the
festival will have a fuller and a finer joyin it all than
can fall to the lot of those who have given nothing,
done nothing and been mere nullities in -the com
munity. â¢ Â¦

Thus it Will., hurt, California m'ore than it will help
Bryan. . In fact the iiÂ»dignation which such a work
will arouse in the State is; likely to react upon the
Bryanites themselves. Calamity howling is bad
enough, but wholesale vilification is worse.
BRYAN'S EXTRA SESSION.
IN his Indianapolis speech Colonel Bryan announced
his intention to get right down to business as soon
as he had taken a bite after inauguration. He
said:
If elected I shall convene Congress in extraordinary
session as soon as inaugurated and recommend an im
mediate declaration of the nation's purposeâ first, to
establish a stable form of government In the Philip
pine Islands, just as we are now establishing a stable
form of government in Cuba; second, to Rive Indepen
dence to the Filipinos, just as we have promised inde
pendence to the Cubans; third, to protect the Filipinos
from outside interference while they work out their
destiny, just as we have protected the republics of
Central and South America, and are by the Monroe
doctrine pledged to protect Cuba.
Here are several propositions of interest to the
American people. In the first place it is Colonel
Bryan's admission and declaration that if he is elected
the same vote will sweep into power a Congress in
agreement with him. , Unless this is the case it would
be futile to call an extra session, for it would not obey
his recommendation and the cost of it would be
wasted. We are of opinion that the interests of the
people do not require such an extra session called
by Colonel Bryan and that the threat of it will de
tract from his vote.
After long paralysis our industries are in motion
again and there is no desire to see their momentum
checked. The long distress entailed by the panic of
1893 has not been forgotten, nor have its effects en
tirely disappeared, though happily becoming a dis
solving view. A political session of Congress will
not aid in the reparation needed by all our material
interests, seamed and scarred as they were by the
awful pinch of that recent depression.
Give us a continuance of calm and progressive com
merce and the Philippine question will reach adjust
ment without any extra session. A further examina
tion of Colonel Bryan's intentions reveals among
them the purpose to transplant the Monroe doctrine
to Asia. That is an excellent hemispherical doctrine,
but was never intended to be an all embracing spheri
cal principle. To transplant it to Asia will require
a larger army and navy than that which so alarms
Colonel Bryan and his followers. To make it opera
tive from Seoul to Aden will be a very large task, in
deed, and yet that is the task set for his country by
this candidate of a potpourri of parties.
If the political burgoo which he represents get
power, there will be no end to the agitation that will
ensue. His extra session will plunge us into con
fusion at home and his Asiatic Monroe docrinc will
keep us busy abroad.
It is not the programme of a statesman, but the pro
gramme of an inflated young man who determines all
means to be legitimate that can help on his ambition.
He says that the Monroe doctrine has for three
quarters of a century been a shield to neighboring re
publics and yet it has imposed no pecuniar}' burden
upon us. That is very true, because we stand guard
but a few days away from the theater on which it must
be enforced if challenged.
With the Philippines it is quite different. No one
in his sober mind will say that we can enforce such a
doctrine in Asia without assuming far greater burdens
than have yet fallen upon us from the Spanish war.
Nor was it ever intended by Monroe and Adams, or
any of their successors, that the Monroe doctrine
should go beyond this hemisphere. They conceived
it to be a measure for our protection, that of the other
countries in this hemisphere being secondary. The
reason for the Monroe principle does not apply in
Asia at all. nor will Colonel Bryan ever have the
chance to attempt its application there.
The people want none of him, his extra session nor
his attempted dictation in the affairs of Asia.

BEST SEASON
OF THE YEAR
BY MARGARET AINSLEE.
VII.
"When Queen Elizabeth attempted to
draw from Sir James Melville some un
favorable comment upon her Scottisn
cousin's performance upon lute and vir
ginal, he parried her thrusts by declaring
that "she played reasonably for a queen.'
Not content with so non-committal a re
ply, the subtle coquette planned one of
her delightful little lmpromtus, hoping
therewith to surprise an unwilling compli
ment from the wily Embassador. She ac
cordingly caused Melville to be conducteo
by a lord in waiting to a gallery, whose
silence was unbroken save by the expres
sionless tinkle of the virginal upon which
she" was artlessly pouring out her soul.
Instantly divining the ruse, the canny
Scot suffered himself to be Intruded Into
the royal presence, protesting that the
music he had heard was of so exquisite
a kind that it had irresistibly drawn him
thither. Compliments sufficiently stimu
lating to the Queen's Jaded Bensibilitles
were then showered, upon her, bat naught
derogatory .to Mary's accomplishments
could be wrung from the master of equi
voque. This little Incident but serves to
fix the date of the spinet or virginal, said
by many to have been named for this
queen among virgins, by others to have
been so called simply "because maids and
virgins do most commonly play on them."
Whatever the derivation of the name of
the virginal, It is sufficient to know that
the Instrument was one of the ancestors
of thÂ« .modern piano. All stringed in-
Btriments of whatever size, shape or
name, played by means of a keyboard,
were descended from the harpsichord or
virginal, or else from the clavichord, and
they differed from each other In the
means by which" their sounds were pro
duced and the consequent distinction in
the quality of -their tone. In one class
sound was obtained by pressure and
shortening of the strings, while in the
other a similar result was achieved by
plucking the strings with quills or Jacks.
The clavichord traced its ancestry back
to the monochord, a primitive instrument
having a single spring stretched over a
soundboard, upon Which were marked the
divisions corresponding to the different
degrees of the scale, and a movable
bridge used for the measurement of vi
brating lengths. As shown In the illus
tration, the earliest monochords were
stretched by means of weights, some va
rieties mentioned by Greek theorists hav
ing as many as fou*r strings. Soon a
primitive form of keyboard, such as had
been used with antiquated organs, was
applied to the manochord. In time the
movable bridge was rer'aced by an up
right wedge atttached.to the key lever,
which, when the key- was pressed by the
finger, struck the string, set it in vibra
tion and simultaneously shortened it to
the length indicated by the key's position.
From this modified monochord there was
but a brief transition to the clavichord
(from, "clavis." a key and "chorda." a
string), which, in spite of i-s increasing
| number of keys and Mrlngs. kept the
i name of monochord as late as the six
1 2 A
tury by quills the Instrument was called
a spinet, a name of double derivation,
from SplnettI, a manufacturer of musical
instruments, and from "spina," a thorn,
or point. ......
The compass of the early keyboards
was but four and a half octaves, and In
the old German Instruments the coloring
was reversed, the raised keys being white
and the -naturals black. The harpsichord
until nearly the close of the- last century
had a place in the orchestra, where Its
increased power atoned for its monoto
nous staccato. In Germany, however. It
never gained a strong foothold. Bach/
and Beethoven claiming that tone and
expression could best be controlled in the
clavichord, which instrument lent itself
more readily than the harpsichord to
nicety of execution. In the German
household it was also claimed that de
spirti its weakness the clavichord was
"the comfort of the sufferers and the
sympathizing friend of . cheerfulness."
Mozart's technique, however, was that of
the harpsichord.
The invention in 1710 of the pianoforte,
from "piano e forte," soft and loud, by
Chrlstoforl, the Florentine harpsichord
maker, drove from the musical field both
the sensitive clavichord and its noisier
rival. Patterned after the trapeze-shaped
psaltery, whose sound was produced by
plucking the strings, the new Instrument
was played like the dulcimer, by striking
with small hammers. To the develop
ments of Sllfcermann of Dresden belong
almost as much credit as to the Inven
tion of Christoforl. Stung by the frank
censure of Bach. Silbermann labored
many years to correct the heavy action
and weakness of the upper notes which
characterized the first pianos. The new
instrument made Its way but slowly be
. cause of the novelty of its technique.
Chopin's appreciation of the Increased
tonal beauty obtained by use of the pedal,
and Beethoven's dramatic musical decla
mation, best described as "tone painting."
did much to prove the superiority of thin
Instrument for vigor, sonorousness and
sustained melody. Its capabilities for
light and shade also commended it to the
general public, but it was not until metal
bracing was successfully used in its con
struction that the piano definitely super
seded its predecessors. Metal was first
used for strengthening and then for mak
ing the entire frame, when it became pos
sible to secure the purest and most bril
liant tones by means of heavy strings un
der great tension. The finest treble string
of the modern Instrument is thicker than
the thickest bass string of the first pi
anos, whose tension was correspondingly
slight when wood offered the only resist
ance. This vast difference \s more read
ily appreciated when we realize that the
strings of the modern grand concert pi
ai.o t-xert a force of 73.000 pounds, only
the solidity of the iron frame preventing
its entire destruction.
AlthouRh the modern Instrument has
sained steadily In strength and mechan
ism, its outward proportion and decora
tion have undoubtedly fallen from grace.
The four and a half octaves for which the
finest of pa3t music has been written lent
a comeliness of proportion sadly lacking
in the modern grand piano. While the
additional modern octaves add to the
thrillnes3 of thÂ£ treble and to the surli
ness of the bass of the concert-hall piano,
for ordinary use this gain in compass is
not commensurate with the unwleldinesa
of the Instrument. The "winj? form" of
the modern grand superseded in the reijrn
of Queen Anne the earlier rectangular
forms. During the middle of the eight
eenth century many of the rectangular
cases were sent to China, where they were
coated with lacquer. When this art was
Imitated In Europe many cases were dec
orated in the Vernis-Martin style with
pictures painted as delicately at minia
tures, part of the case being ornamented
with arabesques of gold upon a dark-col
ored ground. The construction of these
pianos, with their seven slender cabrloJ
legs, was In keeping with the sentiment of
the dainty idyls with which they were
decorated. .
Like other forms of furniture, the piano
was influenced by the reigning fashion, *o
that we find .exterior construction sue
ce-sively harmonizing with the designs of
Sheraton and Ilepplewhlte. Inlaid with
small plnquea of Wedgwood Jasperwaro
or conforming to the classic Greek or Em
pire styles. A curious piano belonging to
the Princess Charlotte was made by
Broadwood rarly In the present century.
Square In shape*, it is veneered with a
single sheet of ivory, the elephant's tuslc
having been cut in circular fashion after
it had been softened by add. Reacting
from the bad taste of the Victorian *ra,
which Is now so .extravagantly decried
manufacturers have made their cases of
rare and carefully selected woods. Alma-
Tadema designed cases In the Byzantine
style, while Burne-Jones revived the old
fashioned trestle support formerly used
for harpsichords, and had the happy ln-
Epiration of painting a rain of roses right
across the sounding-board.

The meeting was called to order by Presi

Wanted to Kill Himself.
, Oscar Shirley, who arrived ; In ; this city
a few. days ago from Antloch." walked up
to .Policeman Coughran Tuesday night
and said he wanted to kill \hlmself. He
had a revolver in his pocket and Cough
ran arrested him "on a charge of carrying
a concealed weapon." Â¦;Â¦'Â¦ He appeared before
Judge Fritz i yesterday,' and as he seemed
to be suffering from an overindulgence In
liquor the Judge continued the case " till
Saturday : to â¢ give him time to steady his
nerves. \ ; â¢ , .
placed diagonally was introduced and so
arranged that it was possible to give the
upper 'tones shorter and thinner strings
'ana longer and heavier ones to the lower
tones." Naturally the thinnest strings re
quired the greatest length.- For example,
were the bass strings of modern pianos
of the same thickness as the treble
strings they would have to be vastly
lengthened In proportion. John Sebastian
Bach\always tuned his own instruments,
testing his syaUm in that famous collec
tion of fugues and preludes in all keys
known as "the well-tempered clavichord."
Despite the. agreeable sensitiveness of
the clavichordâ that "solitary, melan
choly, unspeakably sweet Instrument"â
there was a feeble tremulousness about
it which led to a desire for an instru
ment whose strings could be excited to
stronger vibrations. . To meet this de
mand a keyboard was added to, the an
cient psaltery, and from this combination
was evolved the harpsichord, the most
important of ail the Keyed predecessors
of the piano. In this Instrument the keys
were set In vibration by hard points of
shell or ivory â¢ which when forced up
ward by the depressed keys plucked or
twitched at the springs." 'After the Ivory
points were replaced in the fifteenth cen-

The Toyo Kisen KaJsha's steamer Hong
kong Maru got away * for the Orient
yesterday. She was scheduled to pall at
1 p. m., but it was nearly three hours later
before she got away. Uncle Sam wanted
to send written Instructions to his repre
sentatives in China and the steamer was
held until these letters arrived from
Washington.
The Chinese have been tampering with
telegrams 'sent from Washington to the
Consuls In 'Shanghai, Tientsin and Hong
kong. In consequence explicit directions
and a new cable code has been sent to all
the representatives of the United States
In China. On the arrival of the Hongkong
Maru at Hongk'ong a United States'gun
boat will be in wailing and the ciphers
and dispatches will be carried to the va
rious coast ports. Three weeks from now*
Undo Sam will be getting authentic news
from the seat of war. The Hongkong
Maru sailed at 3:20 p. in.
. Among those who went away on the
Japanese mail boat were Mr. v and Mrs. A.
It. Macondray. The young couple were
married Tuesday night,' and *efter a short
tour in Japan and China will settle down
to housekeeping in Manila.
Bishop Moore of the M. E. church was
also a passenger. A great many. Chris
tlon workers Were down to .see him away,
but the unavoidable delay In the sailing
of the steamer somewhat dampened : the
enthusiasm. A number of hymns, among
them "God Be With You Till We Meet
Again," were sung.' -:.--Â¦â¢Â¦. . '
Count Mutsu, the Japanese Consul, was
also a passenger. - He goes home on a
vacation "* and has ; considerable matter of
Interest on the Japanese question to com
municate to ' the Government at Toklo.
Weird Story of Abduction.
A Chinese" woman, 30 years old, came
down , from 1 Isleton yesterday qji the
steamer Pride of the River. In that Chin
ese camp she is considered a , beauty and
when she- expressed, a desire. to come to
San 1 Francisco a guard was sent with her.
When the steamer reached San Francisco
a hack was waiting for the woman and
her escort and both were hurried to China
town.. From that fact grew a weird story
of an abduction. ;, ~ 1; . _. .

teenth century. It was probably in refer
ence to this Instrument that the following
letter was written by the poet Bembo to
his daughter:
Touching thy desire to learn to play upon the.
monochord. I answer, since because of thy
tender years thou canst not know of thyself,
that Dlaylnc Is suited only for vain and friv
olous women: but I desire thee to be the purest
and most lovable maiden in the world. More
over thou wouldst have but little pleasure or
renown If thou playedst badly, and to play
well it would be necessary for thee to Â«pend
ten or twelve years in practice, without be
ine able to think on anything else. Consider
for thyself Jf that would be proper for thee.
If now thy friends and companions desire thee
to learn to play In order to give them pleas
ure, say. to them that thou wishest not to make
thyself ridiculous before them, and content
thyself with learning and handiwork.
In the early clavichords, which always
kept the rectangular box shape Inherited
from the monochord, the strings were of
the same lengthâ an arrangement not
without Its advantages, since it was thus
easier to keep the strings tuned in uni
son. As the compass of the instruments
increased this uniformity was found to be
impracticable, and a long wooden bridge

TRANSPORT COMES IN

Long List of Cabin, Steerage and
Hospital Passengers and Pris
oners on the Thomas.
The United States army * transport
Thomas arrived from the Orient last night
and anchored in the stream. She was Im
mediately placed In quarantine and the
phvelclans will board her this morning.
The transport has been out twenty-nine
days from Manila and sixteen from Yoko
hama. She brings fifty-one cabin pas
sengers and 137 steerage. There are also
261 sick and wounded on board. Seven
deaths have occurred since the vessel
started across the Pacific. Thirty-one
prisoners are also on the lists and five
stowaways.
the lengthening- of Steuart-street wharf
yesterday. As told exclusively in The Call
three weeks ago the Government has been
given the use of the wharf and In order to
meet requirements it Is to be lengthened
300 feet. Chief Engineer Holmeg' plans
provide for an extension that will give
570 feet frontage on one side and 840 feet
on the other. This will give Uncle Sam
all the room. he wants.
There is trouble in store over a couple
of saloons that the proprietors assert are
on city property. These "gin shops" the
army authorities will not tolerate and in
consequence they must go. The owners
say they will carry, the matter Into court,
but the army authorities declare they will
take possession nevertheless.
The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
decided to advertise for bids for old jum
ber discarded on the front. Informal bids
were asked for and when all were in Com
missioner Herold said the highest bidder
was too low. For every thousand feet of
lumber discarded by the commission M.
J. Hodge offered $2 55, H. Davitt $2 25
and D. Burke SO cents. Chief Engineer
Holmes was satisfied with the bid of
Hodpe. When he went Into office the price
paid for old lumber was ?1 50. then he had
it raised by competition to 12. and, there
fore, $2 55 'he considered a fair rate. . Mc-
Donald of the City Street Improvement
Company said he had never received no
tice of the "call for bids." and on his
showing the board decided to advertise
the matter for ten days.
The chief .wharflnsor was ordered to
keep the bay from channel to Long wharf
in a parallel line clear on Admission day.
Water Front Notes.
The sieKe puns that, were originally In
tended for China were again on the front
yesterday. They were to have gone to
Taku on the Belgian King, but are now
destined for Bsnicia. At the latter place
they will always be in readiness for ship
ment to the Orient.

Mission-street car yesterday." It took
Officer Charles Callahan and Starter Bray
of the Market-street system to get him
to the Harbor police station. He was
charged with disturbing the peace."

He will take a well-earned vacation, and

A successful voyage was made by the

New York Stock Market.
NE"W YORK. Aug. 23.â There was a stirring
of speculative Interest to-day which gave an
appearanoe of greater animation to the stock
market than It has shewn for two weeks past.
The strength centered In the steel group for
the greater part of the day, but in the later
dealings it extended throughout the list. The
list of active stocks was not a long one, but
such as were dealt In show quite uniform gains
extending to near a point or over that m many
cases. The gains were well held and profll
taking made only slight inroads, the close b*:
tng firm though quiet at about the top. Al- ;
though the number of issues dealt In was not
large the trading was not nearly so much coft
centrated In a few stocks as for some time
pant. In the steel group the gains ranged from
a point to 2 and 2\i. the latter figures in
National Steel and Steel and Wire. There was
no exception In the group to the upward ten
dency, which was due to the reports of the
growing demand for Iron and iron products
of pretty much all grades. The progress of
negotiations for the settlement of. wage sched
ules which are going on was probably re
flected also in the movement. Generally speak
ing the demand for stocks Is partly ascribablu
to the requirements of the short Interest which
was made uneasy by the check to the decline
effected yesterday. Their disquiet was in
creased by several Incidents of the day. Prices
received an opening Impetus to an advance on
the better tone of the London market, which
was encouraged by the reported successes of
General Roberti egainst the Boers. Actual
buying for London account was on a small
scale. The homeward course from summer va
cations In Europe of a number of influential
men In Wall street movements was a senti
mental influence for the advance, the room
traders who still absorb practically, all the
dealings seeking to anticipate. the coming oper
ations which they suppose these men will em

ket remain unchanged.

Nezv York Money Market.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says
"The last four years have witnessed a re
markable expansion in the American outlook
politically. Industrially and financially. We
have been forced into world politics. as never
before, owing to -our widening Interests; we
have witnessed a most extraordinary develop
ment in our foreign trade, chiefly because we
are now abie to manutacture for the world's
markets:; and, finally, we find ourselves lenders
of money to nations in all parts of the world
as a natural 6equence. Ten years ago the man
who had the courage to predict such things
would have been Â«conEi<Jered a fit candidate for
the lunatic asylum; to-day they are aceom
pllshfd realities and indisputable testimony of
& vigorous and continous national growth.
"The money market will l*ar watching. At

then fall upon New York banks. Just now
bond redemptions and Government disburse

have ceased for the present, and there is no
anxiety jcmcernliig their resumption. Europe
has had distinct relief through American ship
ments, and now that the Transvaal war ie
drawing to a close and the prospects of war
in China are vfry remote there Is decidedly less
apprehension In European financial centers
This is fortunate for the New York market,
as any increase in the tension over there would
certainly have led to a more rapid return of
our securities, which, if coupled with close
money here later on. would have effectually
rherked any bull movement. Other conditions
continue favorable. The corn crop will be large
and is almost out of danger The wheat har

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â New York and Liverpool were
higher. Paris was lower. A better Inquiry
was reported from London at firm prices.
Chicago was firm, with limited offerings, a
fair local and a big export demand, which,
however, was curtailed by scarce tonnage. All
markets . reported a good demand for spot at
a premium over futures, with decreasing re
ceipts. Southwest exporters were good buyers
and the impression was that the market had
really turned at last. There were liberal for
eign acceptances of about 500,000 bushels at
Chicago. The foreigners were buyers of fu
tures. Broomhall estimated the British crop
at 54,000,000 bushels, with Import requirements
of 190,000,000. It was raining again In the Red
River Valley, and where headed the Wheat was
rotting in the shocks and piles and much of
It would be worthless for milling. Closing
cables were %c higher for Wheat and %c higher
for Corn.
In this market futures advanced, but spot
prices were unchanged,

rather small audience.
Paloma ha3 done good work since her

of her subject, a surer technique anil
even bigger tone than the firm chlid fin

was partly new, and included a musical
transcription of her Impressions of Yo

considerably more mature, more musical,
than anything she has yet attempted.

The habeas corpus case of Maud Blood
good was dismissed yesterday by the Jus
tices of the Supreme Court. The girl was
convicted of vagrancy and. sentenced by
a Police Judge to the Industrial school.
She was taken to the Magdalen Asylum
and she has been there ever since. Re
cently her father, E. Bloodgood, applied
for a writ of habeas corpus to secure her
release. In support of his application he
attacked the standing of the asylum by
setting up that it Is not & publfc institu
tion, but a private Catholic home for un
ruly girls. He was vigorously opposed by
the attorneys for the asylum, who con
tended that the Magdalen Asylum Is the
successor to the old industrial school. The
case was partly argued and continued in
order to allow the records to be produced.
The records would have decided more
than the point Involved, for the asylum
is receiving considerable support from the
cltv for the care of unruly girls, but be
fore they were produced again Acting
Mayor Tobin and Police Judge Cabaniss
signed an order to the Mother Â¦ Superior
to release the girl. This shut off all fur

more than enough rushing at the univer

preparations for a rush with the freshmen
to continue.
"The class has violated Its honor," said
President Wheeler, "with regard to Its
word to the university. Not the whole
class, but Us leaders. I feel very much
grieved over the affair. Haven't you done
about as much as you can afford to do

WORD OF HONOR
It seems to be settled that the Repub
lican State Convention will nominate
Samuel M. Shortrldge for Presidential
elector-at-large. Leon Sloss is spoken of
as a good running mate for Mr. Short
ridge. Among those mentioned for place*
on the electoral ticket to represent the
several districts are: E. C. Voorheis of
Amador, E. M. Preston of Nevada, Wil
liam R. Davis and Senator E. K. 'laylor
of Alameda and. Mr. Bennett, ex-presi
dent of the Pacific Coast Traveling Men's
Association. It is an open question
whether Senator Taylor is eligible, aa he
holds a State offl.ee. Some years ago a
Republican State Convention desired to
placet the late Colonel Fred Crocker on
the electoral - ticket, but after reflection
In the Sixth District the Democrats will
doubtless nominate General John R.
Mathews. He is an anti-boss man of,
character and Intelligence, but has no in
clination for public service. It Is said by
his friends that he will not accept the
nomination.
In the Fourth District the candidates
most frequently mentioned by Democrats
are Senator R. Porter Ashe and Charles
Edelman. It is said that Mayor Phelan,
during his recent absence from the city,
wired to a friend here, advising that no
one be indorsed until he returned, as h&
had hopes of persuading Judge Coffey to
enter the contest. The Mayor, who is
supposed to be against Senator Ashe, is
not enthusiastically in favor of Edelman.
A three-cornered fight In the Second
District seems probable. ' Frank D. Nich
ols of Stockton Was entered the fray
against Jo D. Sproul of Chlco and
A. Camlnetti of Amador. Mr. Sproule is
tho leading candidate.
Frank I... Coombs has developed the
greatest strength of any candidate, but
owing to the attitude of the Sonoma dele
gation he Is not sure of winning out. The
unpopularity of A. B. Ummun in Santa
Rosa complicates the contest. If Lem
.mon were not for Coombs many Repub
licans who are now indifferent would fall
into line for the leading candidate, but
the Santa Rosa Poatn aster can make en

of Red Bluff are mentioned as candidates
for the nomination.

Of S. M. White Edward McCabe, member
of the State Building and Loan Commis
sion, delivered an address in which he
predicted success for the Democratic na
tional ticket this year. He then paid a
glowing tribute to ex-Senator White. He
referred to his good work while a mem
ber of the United States Senate and to his
ability as a statesman, characterizing him
as a tower of Intellectual strength. He
urged the election of State Senators who.
would lend their support to a man who
had represented the State of California
with such credit to himself and such hon
or to the people. After the applause fol
lowing the conclusion of McCabe's speech
had subsided he was followed by Clltus
Barbour, T. J. Fitzslmmons. Major Ellis
Powell and John Heenan, who spoke on
similar lines.
Chairman Ford then appointed a com
mittee, consisting of S. Kohlmann, T. J.
Fitzslmmons, Robert Murray and Major
Powell to wait on Mayor Phelan and ask
for an explanation regarding the peddling
of tickets at the last Democratic primary
which wore printed by non-union printing
offices. The attention of the Allied Print

the fact that "scab" tickets were used at
the primary.

resolution follows:
THE Senatorial candidacy of Hon.
Stephen M. White was fairly launch
ed last night by the Thirty-ninth
District Independent Bryan and
Stevenson Democratic Club at Saratoga
Hall. The meeting was largely attended
and White's name Mas cheered to. the
echo every time it was mentioned by the
several able speakers who voiced eloquent
tribute to the merits of that stalwart
member of the party. The resolution fa
voring White's candidacy and pledging in
his behalf the candidate for State Senator
of the district, who will hold over until
the election takes place, was read amid
great and frequent applause and was
adopted by a rising vote.
The adoption of the resolution was in
itself a repudiation of the Senatorial aspi
rations of Mayor Phelan and the ques
tionable political methods employed by
his henchmen at the last Democratic pri
marv. No unkind words were said against
Phefan. but the rebuke administered by
an organization which numbers exactly
428 voters on Its membership roll was none
the less scathing for the calm and digni

Delegates to State Convention.
In the matter of the delegates to the
State Convention your committee respect
fully recommends that the chairman and
secretary of the County Committee cer
tify to the chairman of the Republican
State Committee in accordance with thÂ«
call of said State Central Committee du
plicate certified lists of the following del
egates:
To the committee it nppeared that only
two courses were open to itâ either to un
?rat the delegation entirely and to leave
the district without representation or to
seat the delegation above recommended.
In the Fortieth District much evidence
was introduced tending to show irregular
ity on behalf of. the ticket recommended
to be seated and some as to the contest
ins delepration.
It appears, however, to the committee
that assuming all of the testimony of the
contestants to be true there still remained
f-ufficient votes on the part of the ma
jority ticket to entitle it to credentials
and that none of tho delegates named
had any personal participation in any
of the irregularities.
Your committee reports that In the
Thirty-fifth. Thirty-seventh, Thirty-ninth
and Fortieth Assembli- districts and in
the Forty-fifth Assembly District it rec
omm*Â»n<1s the denial ot the contests anJ
the seating of the delegates who upon the
face of the returns appear to have been
elected.

CyT? XOTHER batch of so-called elec
//\\ tion returns' has been pent to the
/i==Â±\ Republican State Central Com
Â£1 mittce. This batch was made up
by Martin Kelly and Phil Crira
mins at the Mint saloon. It purports to
be a list of delegates to the Fourth Con-
Brewlonal PiFtrict Republican Conven
tion. The State Committee of course pays
DO attention to the list, as no call war Is
sued for a primary election in the Fourth
District. Th<> legitimate convention of the
Republican party in the Fourth District
will consist of delegates elected at the pri
rr.fiiy election held under the auspices of
the Republican County Commute.- in ac
cordance with the provisions of the offi
cial call of the Republican State Central
r.rnimiuee. The delegates to the State
convention at Santa Cruz from th< Assem
:Â¦:>â¢ districts within the boundaries of the
Fourth Congressional District will resolve
themselves into a nominating convention
and will no doubt nominate Julius Kahn
to represent the district in Â«"ongress for
another term. Tre duty of appointing a
Congressional district committee will also
devolve upon the convention. Clean Re
jublicans should be on the. alert at Santa
Cruz to block the game of the bosses.
Kelly and Crimmins' chief point is to con
trol the district committee. While high
minded citizens of the party will be en
gaged in efforts to win a great victory for
McKinley and Roosevelt the corrupt
bosses will be hiding away in some dark
recess and plotting to get control of the
committee.
The Republican County Committee of
San Francisco will not vex the State con
vention with contests. The report of the
returning: board clears the way for an
easy adjustment of all controversies grow
ing out of the recent primary election In
this city. _ ' j_ "-'
It appears now that the efforts of Kelly
and Crtmmln* to prolong strife in the Re
publican County Committee will prove
futUe. The Examiner and Bulletin are
backing up the bosses to continue the
fight against the better elements of the
Republican party, but Republicans must
expect that kind of opposition from Demo
cratic newspapers. Indications point to
an indorsement of the returning board's
course
The committee of eighteen have made a
thorough canvass of all the returns pre
sented, excepting these from the Korty
third District. A resolution was adopted
last night directing the i?sue of creden
tial to 1?8 of the 250 delegates to the
loiral convention.
Betrayed by John J. Curry.
The inquiry relating to the election in
the Forty-third District will be resumed
to-day. The clean Republicans in tills
district were betrayed by John J. Curry,
a County Committeeman. He was a can
didate for State Printer on the Dtmo
craii<- ticket in the Budd-Estee campaign.
He came over to the Republican party
with promises of fidelity to the anti-boss
cause. There was opposition to his selec
tion as a County Committeeman, but his
rej>t-atÂ«-d ;.n>'<-*Â»iions of loyajty to good
principles were accepted and he wa.s al
lowed to tako his seat in the committee.
He has proved to be a ready agent of the
corrupt bosses. Somehow he managed to
deceive HÂ«-nry Stern, a decent citiren. ami
obtain.-- 1 ...< latter' Â» assistance in efforts
t," ..i ,..-:<le the will of the honest voters
â¢ i the district. The election officers ap
pointed by Â«. majority of the committee
men in the district permitted the most
outrageous frauds to be i*erj>etrated at
the recent primary. The opium liends,
loafers and "hopheade" from the saloons
of the tenderloin were permitted without
Â» restraint t" vote the names of retractable
citizens. The false voting was openly in
favor of the K< jiy-Crimmins ticket.
The returning board will probably flnisn
tta wÂ«rii m-n-itht. -The .credentials duly
aitÂ«-Â«TÂ»--l \,:\\ t,Â«? issued to all delepalea
who are entitled to organize the conven
tion. After the organization Is effected
other cuntf-sts may be heard. Repub
licans In th*- city and throughout the
State will be gratified to learn thai Kelly
and Â«'r:mrnins will not organize the con
vention or control its affairs, although thÂ«j
bofj;<-.s r^nrtcd to repeating-', elufflr.g and
pmacfring of ballot-boxes and every
knomii device of fraud to gain such con
trol.
Credentials Ordered Issued.

RINGLING BROTHERS'
CIRCUS IS COMING
The Big Hippodrome and Menagerie
Is Billed to Show Here Next
Month.
Local Bhowgoers will shortly have an op
portunity to get acquainted with a big
show that has never exhibited in this city,
but which in other sections of the United
States is regarded as the leading arenic
institution now before the American pub
lic. For several years past those who
make it a business to watch the trend of
things theatrical have regarded the rise
and growth of Ringling Brothers circus
with astonishment, and wonder has often
been expressed that the show has not
made its way^lo the Pacific 'Coast. Two
years ago it was expected that the show
would come to San Francisco, but the ne
gotiations fell through and the trip was
abandoned.
This year, however, all arrangements
have been completed for a tour of the
country from coast to coast. The show
has now reached the North Pacific Coast,
and after playing at Seattle, Tacoma and
Portland will come almost direct to San
Francisco. The engagement here is for
eight days, and will be inaugurated
Â¦Wednesday. September 19. with what Is
declared to be the most brilliant free
street parade ever organized by a circus
management.
This parade is In thirty sections, each
complete in itself, and is nearly a mile
and a half in length. The performances
which follow are on an unusually elab
orate scale. The exhibition is given in a
great hippodrome pavilion, with seats for
18 0)0 persons. There are three rings, two
stages, a vast aerial space and a quarter
mile hippodrome track. The circus com
pany numbers 300 high class performers.
The menagerie includes twenty-five ele
phants, twenty camels and many rare ani
mals infrequently seen in captivity. A
military spectacle and a revival or the
exciting Roman hippodrome races add to
the interest of the exhibition.
General Shafter received a telegram
'yesterday from the Secretary of "War di
recting him to- send 255 men from the re
cruit camp at the Presidio tt> the follow
ing commands: Forty to tfi% Third Cav
alry, thirty to the Fourth Cavalry, ten ,
to the First Artillery, fifteen to the
Fourth Artillery and i ?rty each to the
Fourth, Nineteenth, Twentieth and Twen
ty-second Infantry. The men are at pres
ent in fair shape for active duty, most of
them having been in the camp for weeks
undergoing daily drill in tactics and tar
get shooting.
Samuel Black, a recruit prisoner, es
caped yesterday morning. He had re
ceived a letter containing money early in
the day, and a short while after applied
to the guard to be taken out for exercise.
Another prisoner made the same request,
and they were both sent out under guard.
Black awaited Ms opportunity and en
tered one of the houses near the camp,
sneaking for the hills through the rear.
The guard was called out and a thorough
search instituted, but Black made good
his escape.
Captain Frank Crenshaw, who juat be
fore his death at his home in Atlanta, Ga.,
charged the doctors and nurses of the
general hospital with treating him with
cruelty and neglect, is remembered here,
as a volunteer officer suffering from a
bullet wound in the head, who was par
ticularly well treated on account of the
severity of his injury. His right side
was paralyzed, and at times he became
almost a maniac and required a great deal
of attention. He was probably not in full
possession of his faculties when he made
the charges. "i;
The corrals and stables at the Presidio
are tilled with animals. Colonel Marshall
has had a most successful trip and has
secured a fine lot of horses and mules. A
consignment of 100 mules is expected from
the neighborhood of Stockton this even-
n Battery O, with Its large guns, left the
Presidio this morning and will take sta
tion at Benicia.

the pain in my head declared itself again. I
placed myself under the care of physicians, ten
or twelve different ones, but without success.
Four of these doctors operated on my head In
the past two years without any good results.
All these operations, as already stated.
were without favorable result, as the doctors
do not know what to do, and as I cannot stand
the pain any longer I perform the last opera
tion on myself and say my last irood-by, and
wish herewith at the same time the best for my

C. F. STAACK.
24S6 Market street
Staack was a native of Germany and 59
years old. He leaves a wife and five
children in destitution. The oldest child
is a girl of 13 years. Four. years ago he
retired from business owing to ill health.
He was subject to epileptic fits and fre
quently fell in convulsl on the street.
Mrs. Staack says her husband was
driven to suicide by the neighbors, who
tormented him as well as herself and
children from morning to night. A war
rant was issued two months ago for the
arrest of Mrs. John Tennant, one of the
neighbors. She was accused of knocking
down Mrs. Staack's five-year-old girl.
The case was continued by Judge Ca
baniss and has not since been called.
Mrs. Staack says the neighbors used to
pelt her husband . with stones whenever
he went on the back piazza.
The autopsy revealed the fact that
Staack had used the peg of a toy top in
taking his own life. This small piece of
metal, sharpened down to a point, he had
wrapped with black cotton thread so that
it would fit the mouth of the cannon.

a remarkable verdict last evening. In

ON KEARNY STREET
Lively Mix-Up in Which Confection

Were Represented.
Fists "whistled" through the air, side
steps and hooks were in order and claret
flew at the corner of Kearny and Post
streets about 6:30 yesterday afternoon
Two men well known in the retail busi
ness section, namely. 1 T. G. Gruenhagen
and Mike Claraty, were the combatants.
Gruenhagen is the confectioner. Claraty
is employed at MAse Gunst's place on
Kearny street, nearly opposite Gruenha
gen's.
There had been trouble previously be
tween the two/ which culminafed in the
little shindy of yesterday. Many specta
tors passed, and paused to get a glimpse
of the mix-up. Claraty is much younger
but not so heavy as Gruenhagen. While
they were at It the work was lively. A
stiff punch on Gruenhagan's nose ter
minated the affair.

war, which .was conducted with so much
annoyance to the police and so great a
loss of life last winter, is about to break

gathering broke up in a row, each side
as earnest to tight as it was at the com-
meneement of'the hostilities.
The trouble between the two faction?,
was never settled. Most of the Suey Sing
men were cannery employes and v/ent

membership secured employment in the

have been trying to effect a settlement.
Several meetings have been called for
that purpose, but nothing has been aoÂ«

the Seventeenth-street police station to
await developments. Mrs. Sonntag be
came anxious at her daughter's absence
and went to the grocery, where she was
told that the child had been taken to the
police station by a stranger. She hur
ried to the station and was confronted
by her husband. Both were completely
unnerved, and the woman wept bitterly
because her husband refused to talk to
her. She was detained at the station ajid
Anthony went to 351 Capp street, whero
the eloping couple had been living. under
the name of Rowland, and brought the
younger girl to the station. The Sonn
tags, parents and children, were then
taKen to police headquarters.
Roepke, as soon as he learned what had
happt-nea. went to police headquarters
with his baby boy, Leon, and when he
and Sonntag met in Captain Seymour's
office there was an exciting scene, as
Sonntag could hardly, be restrained from
flying at Roepke's throat. They were all
sent to the City Prison and in about an
hour Mrs. Sonntag and Roepke were al
lowed to go, as Sonntag said he only
wanted his two children. Roepke, with
his baby in his arms, and accompanied by
Mrs. Sonntag, loitered for nearly two
hours on the sidewalk on McAllister
street. The woman was looking at the
prison where her children were confined,
and during all the time she was moaning
and wringing her hands at being separat
ed from them and disowned by her hus
band. Suddenly sne pulled the revolver
out of her dress pocket and fired the bul
let at her right temple, falling with her
head resting on the stone coping near the
entrance to the hall. A crowd quickly
gathered and the woman, with the blood
flowing from the wound in her temple,
was conveyed to the Receiving Hospital.
Policeman McGee took Roepke to the
prison, as it was thought that he might
have fired the shot, but Warren Olney of
101 Sansome street, who saw the shooting
from the hall steps, and others informed
the officer that the woman had fired the
shot.. Roepke, however, was detained and
to-day a charge will be preferred against
him by the wronged husband. His baby
is In the care of the matron. There is
nothing attractive about â¢ Roepke's per
sonality, and the hope was generally ex
pressed that some means would be found
to punish him.
Mrs. Sonntag was repentant at the hos
pital. She said if her husband would only
take her back she would prove a good and
faithful wife to him, as she had seen the
error of her ways. . Sonntag called at the
hospital to see her. and broke, down com
pletely as he stood by her cot. She i m .
plored him to take her back, but he was
obdurate. Later he said that he might
take her back for the sake of the chil
dren.
I came here," he said, "with the inten
tion of killing Roepke, but when I saw my
girl this morning better thoughts came to
me, as the question of. what would become
of her In case I was arrested arose In my
mind. I cannot understand why he pre
ferred my wife to his own, as she Is much
younger, better looking and a fine house
keeper. We have been- married- fourteen
years, having been united a year after I
came to this country from Germany. I
have made up my mind -to stay in this
city and work at my trader so that I can
have a home for my children. Whether
my wife will form a part of that home I
don t yet know."
Sonntag Is small In stature, but he is
a much more intelligent man than
Roepke. He took his two girls away with
him .yesterday afternoon, and this morn
ing will swear to the complaint against

When Sonntag heard that his wife had

CHRISTIAN FREDERICK STAACK,
a retired concrete contractor, com
mitted suicide yesterday morning at
his home. 246S Market street, by
sending a missile through his heart with
a toy cannon. Letters left by him show
that he was undoubtedly insane, if evi
dence were needed other than the strange
means he employed in killing- himself.
At about half-past 8 o'clock his wife
heard the report of a firearm in his room
and hurried thither. She found her hus
band in bed, his breast .covered blood,
and he unconscious and gasping. Doctors
were at once summoned from the German
Hospital, but he died in half an hour.
Staack used a castiron Fourth of July
cannon about four inches long and thirty
caliber.- This he fastened into the top of
a pyramid composed of four blocks, of
wood to steady it. Then he placed it in
a frame on a small table by nls bedside,
moved the cannon to within a few Inches
of his left breast and touched off the pow
der with a match.
.The following letter, written in German
on a letterhead of Fred Staack & C \
and addressed to The Call, was found In
his room:
SA.N FRANCISCO, Cal., 1S9 .

Colonel James R. Garniss, capitalist and
man of business, resident manager of the
American. Surety Company, has married
Miss Barbara Eckert, a trained nurse.
Such is the news which has set the gos
sips talking. Colonel Garniss is white
haired, a pioneer of California. Mrs. Gar
niss Is many years his junior. , Colonel
Garniss was Jll. Miss Barbara Eckert
was his nurse. Her touch was soft, her
manner sympathetic, her skill that of an
expert in anticipating and administering
to every need of the invalid. She had the
qualities which made Sir Walter Scott
utter his famous eulogy on woman:
"When pain and anguish wring the brow,
a ministering angel, thou."
The occasion of the first acquaintance
of Colonel Garniss and Miss Eckert was
the Illness of the former. Dr. George R.
Martin, the family physician, recommend
ed Miss Eckert as a nurse. She hag prac
ticed several years with success. Colonel
Garniss welcomed her. Two years ago
the foimer Mis. Garniss died and Colonel
Garniss was lonely. He saw in Miss Eck
ert the qualities "' tht*t constituted - an
agreeable companion. In the sick "room
a romance began. When Colonel Garniso
reached convalescence Miss Eckert was
made aware that there was more than
gratitude in the manner of her patient,
fahe. attended faithfully to her duties until
he was completely recovered. Then she
departed, for her services were needea
elsewhere.
Her absence brought out her many ex
cellent qualities in strong relief. Colonel
Garniss sought her out and proposed mar
riage. Miss Eckert had reached the age
of ripe judgment, and she appreciated
fully the honor that was tendered. The
Garniss residence on Pine street, between
Leavenworth and Hyde, is handsome, and
the position of mistress of such a. home
is a proud one. At first, however, so the
gossips say. Miss Eckert declined rtie
proffered honor.- Colonel Garniss was bent
on matrimony, and in the end Miss
Eckert consented to become Mrs. Colonel
Garniss.
'lhe marriage did not -take place in this
city, but in ban Mateo. Colonel Garniss
decidedly objected to having his plans
become the subject of gossip. The cere
mony occurred about six weeks ago, July
19 being named as the day to be happily
remembered. Colonel Garniss was a gen
erous bridegroom and the bride received
many handsome presents. After a short
time Colonel and Mrs. Garniss returned
to San Francisco and went to reside in
the handsome home on Pine street. Noth
ing was said. Colonel Garniss has since
told his friends that he considered the
affair was strictly the business only of
himself and Mrs. Garniss and did not con
cern any one else.
However, the gossips have just learned
of the facts. Mrs. Goodman, a sister of
Colonel Garniss, who resraes at the Pal
ace, heard the news only a few days ago
and she was greatly surprised. Colonel
Garnirs smilingly acknowledges that he
is again a benedict.
Mrs. .Garnlss is a native of 'Wheeling:.
TV. Va. She has a sister who is a trained
nurse and who devotes her time to the
care of a brother who is blind. Colonel
Garniss will receive many congratulations
upon his newly found happiness. He ac
knowledged yesterday that he would be
cut of the city for a day or two, antici
pating that his acquaintances would
"josh^' him.
