,/i \\' J PÂ° n to aid a common cause und relieve a distressed people. The ap-
II llpeal from the inundated districts of the Texas coast has been" a*
promptly rt-Vponded to by thtm as though It was to them alone it was
iddressed.'- The news of the Galveston disaster, followed by the call
iJv.i.. for aid, took them to the counsel chamber. Thera they laid their
plans for a benefit, but that their aid might be of greater benefit in the fields
of, .suffering and death they decided to forthwith subscribe $1000 to the relief
fund and. immediately forward the same to the authorities of Texas.
A' check was yrepared and signed and by to-night this money will have
been expended in securing comfort for many of the homeless. The discussion
of the proposal to five a benefit to secure additional funds for the relief of
the sufferers was next taken up. Without much arsument It was decided to
give the benefit at the Orpheum-on Tuesday next. Kach thf Jter In San Fran

Managers Send Big Check to
Flood Victims and Will Again
Respond to Call for Aid.
SAX FRANCISCO'S Board of Trade will make immediate and substan
tial response to the urgent appeals for aid from stricken Galveston
The appalling tragedy that destroyed the business of the city par
alyzed its commerce and left no employment for thousands of home
less and suffering people but to search the tide for the dead and dy
ir.K. is as keenly lamented throughout San Francisco as elsewhere on the
Rlobe. Likewise the response to the call for aid has been as prompt and will
be as rich in result.
Though yesterday was a holiday, early in the morning various members
of the Board of Trade conferred with President A. A. Watkins as to the
advisability of calling a meeting of the directors forthwith. Messengers
were sent to the various members of the board of directors. Within a few
hours the meeting had convened and suggestions had been offered as to the
beft means to the end. At the suggestion of President Watkins it was agreed
that three solicitors ehouid be employed to visit each and every member of
the Board of Trade, lay before them the purpose of the board andsecure their
subscriptions. A corps of employes under the direction of Henry S. Smith,
secretary of the Board of Trade, took up the labor of notifying as many mem
bers as possible of the, distress and urgent reed of the people of Galveston.
Until late In the evening the work of notifying the members of the Board
of Trade went on. This morning It is rxptcted that the gold will begin pour
ing into the coffers cf the relief committee and into the satchels of the so
licitors.
At the meeting: yesterday It was decided that money, not food and cloth
ing, would b<" forwarded for the aid of the distressed. Before food or cloth
ing could roach Galveston from this part of the country it would be too late to
be of benefit. As soon a^ the money comes In it will be r.lred to GaJveston
and within a day or two, perhaps by to-night,, the first Installment of San
Francisco's contribution will have reached the ucepe of the disaster.
"Our action for the relief of the sufferers of Galveston." said President
Watkins. "was tho result of our own deliberations and followed the sugges
tion of various members who called and made known to me their determin
ation to aid the sufferers of the flooded district. As soon as the relief fund
has assumed Fubftantial proportions it will be wired to Galveston.
"P<rhaps w* will sono the money to the Mayor of the stricken city, maybe
to the Governor of the State or to any committee which we are advised is in
charge of the relief work. By taking thrs means we will be able to assist
the sufferers when they most need assistance. From one day's labor we ex
pect substantial results."

SCENE OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION IN STORM-RENT GALVESTON.
GAL.VKSTON, Tex., Sept. 11.â Over
2300 bodies have already been taken
out to sea or bjirled in trenches.
Other hundreds are yet to be taken
from the ruins. These bodies are now ill
badly decomposed and they are being
burled In trenches where they are found.
Others are being burned in the debris
where it can Â¦foe done safely.
There is little attempt at identification
and It Is safe to say that there will never
be a complete list of the dead.
. Chief of Police Ketchum Is in charge of
the work of burying thfc dead. There are
large bodies of men engaged in this work,
tearing up the ruins and getting out the
corpses. Sorrie of those â¢whose bodies arc
being taken out were probably only, in
jured when they were first struck down,
but there was no getting relief to them,
and they perished miserably.
, The remnant of the force of regular sol
diers who were stationed here, and It is
a very small remnant, have joined the po
lice in patrolling the city. ' â¢ Â¦
Several persons have already been shot,
It' Is reported.- A soldier of Captain Raf
ferty's battery, while patrolling the beach
this morning, ordered a man to desist
from looting. The fellow drew a weapon
and the soldier shot him dead. . The sol
dier was attacked by fcur other men and
he killed all of them. He had five'car
tridges in his rifle and each of them found
a victim.
Other men have also been shot but the
details. are not known, nor can the exact
number be ascertained. It. is probable
that twenty-five were killed. Some of
these were shot for falling to halt when'
ordered to do so. Others were shot for
vandalism.
The ruins of the brick buildings have
not yet been searched for the dead, and
there is a large number in them. In the
mass of rubbish which marks the site of
the Lucas Terrace Bridge house forty or
fifty people were killed outright and' their
bodies are still In the ruins.
The Orphans' Home is totally demol
ished. Ninety-two children and eleven
nuns were killed. It is rumored that one
sister escaped, but if she did no. trace can
be found of her.
Of the regular soldiers few remain.
Twenty-three were drowned at the bar
racks at Camp Hawley and seven at Boli
var. .One man drifted about in the bay
until Monday morning and was taken out
alive.
The correspondent stood at the foot of
Tremont street and counted" nine floating
bodies without- mo'vlns, and* this Js .only,
one instance. \ It is not known 'whether
these were water, front victims . or. dead
beings cast up by the sea. A lot of rub

GOVERNOR OF TEXAS
WIRES THE CALL ON LOSS
OF LIFE AND PROPERTY
MOST conflicting arc the reports from Galveston relating
to the number of persons killed by the hurricane. Es
timates of the dead range from hundreds to thousands.
In a message to The Call Governor Savers of Texas says the loss
of life in Galveston alone is from 600 to 1500. The relief com
mittee of Galveston, headed by Mayor Jones, declares the dead
will number 3000. In another message Jones figures out that
5000 perished in the storm-swept city. However this may be,
the fact remains that thousands of families are homeless. Relief
is being hastened to them from many sections of the Union.
GALVESTOX, Texas, Sept. 11. â Some order is being
brought out of chaos, and something like a systematic attempt
is being made to clear the debris and remove the dead. Idlers
are being pressed into the service at the point of the bayonet
and made to work, and a military cordon is being drawn tighter
and tighter about the place. Even- horse and mule that was left
in the city is in service. Supplies are coming in from Houston,
and the first line of communication with the outside world was
obtained to-day via Texas City. The forces are working on rail
roads, and in a few days the people of Galveston believe the situ
ation will be greatly improved.
AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. 11.â To The Gall, San Eran
cisco: The loss of life at Galveston -alone is
from 600 to 1500. The loss of property is $10,
000,000. Four thousand houses were swept away.

Mare Islar)d and Other
Points nf Interest
ALL the payety and good humor
and g-ood fellowship of the
great celebration was focused
in Mechanics' Pavilion last
night, and the grand ball that
marked- the close of the four
days of festivities Wiis the
brightest, merriest feature of them all.
The celebration is over.
It outdid in every particular anything of
ltÂ« hort rver attempted in California.
The drcorations surpass* d in beauty, the
Illumination made a fairyland of the city,
the parade dwarfed all that had preceded
It. and the Native Bens and Daughters,
conscious <if the scattering to the corners
of the State that would come with to
day, crowdtd all the spirit of merriment
That characterized the celebration into
the waltzes and twosteps and schot
tlschc-s of the grand ball.
The rain fell drearily and the streets,
that had been so gay with lights and flags
end bunting and so thronged with people,
seemed desolate by contrast. The bright
colors of the bunting- ran together arid
made crimson and yellow streaks on door-
Ft^ps and across sidewalks. Raindrops
dimmed the glory of the incandescent
lights festooned along 1 etreets and over
buildings, but inside Mechanics* Pavilion
there was no hint of the dreariness out
side. There 1500 people danced merrily,
â¢Â»h!le thousands more watched the danc
ers with delight and all thought only that
the end of the celebration was near and
That the pleasures of the ball must com
plete the measure of Joy of the carnival.
Mechanics' Pavilion never looked any
thing but barnlike until last night. The
decorations for the grand ball trans
formed it into a semblance of beauty that
was distinctly creditable to those wh'j
v.-rougM the transformation. ."Above tho
center of the dancing space, high up to
ward the timbers supporting the roof.
Â«erc stretched long streamers bearing
two white stripes and threÂ« blue ones, and
Â¦with blue fields bearing thirteen stars.
FUd. white and blue bunting adorned the
gallery rail. Yellow bunting hung in
praoeful fold* from chandeliers and from
the rcuprh timbers of the pavilion. Thou
sands of small flags â the national colors
and the bear flagâ fluttered from pillar*
and rafters.
The crowd began (fathering early and

Â¦was well handled. The open space bo

At 9:30 o'clock Judge F. ii. Kerrigan,
the floor manager, gave the signal, the

Erand march b*tran.
Judge R. C. Rust, grand president of the
Native Sons of the (Jolden West, and Mrs.
j.m:Â« <J.it. jjrand president of the Na

wore a white silk poplin, en train, with a

, the leaders had trod the length of the
[ floor ten times and ton rows of couples
i extended the lergth of the tloor. In half,
Ian hour &J0 couples were keeping step
: with the musicâ such u grand march as
j had never been seen before in San Fran
j cisco.
In that siruous line of young peop'.e
| were to be seen the uniforms and the
I badges of a hundred and sixty parlors of
! Native Sons and Daughters. Young men
; from the northern limits of the State.
j from the counties of Sierra Nevada
j and from the orange belt of the south
j were marching, and their partners were
j from every portion of the State.
It was a srand ball that In truth cele
Â¦ brnK'd for California her semi-centennial.
| Youth and beauty from every part of the
Stale was there to participate in its de
lights and to picture them afterward to
tht : ir associates at home who were less
fortunate.
At 10 o'clock the folds of the line of the
grand march covered the floor between
th<Â» tiers of spectators, and at a signal the
band struck up a waltz, the line broke
and the couples whirled into the mazes
of the dance.
While the lack of uniformity and con
ventionality in dress detracted possibly
from the scene as viewed in sections of
the ?ize of an ordinary bail, in its en
tirety the sea of dancers was a fascinat-
I ing sight.
J An acre and a half of young people

Evening dress or uniform, Â¦whichever
suited individual convenience, was worn
Many of the women were handsomely
gowned, and white and the delicate
shades prevailed in the color scheme of
the field of dancers, Â¦with here and thero
a dress of brighter hue giving it a dash
of life.
The hundreds of young women in the
j dances were to a remarkable degree rep
resentative of the California girl. Amons
them could be seen magnificent speci
mens of beautiful women. Junos with
masses of Titian hair. Perfect types of
Spanish beauty mingled with ths less
pronounced types of American woman
hood. The ball vividly illustrated the
cosmopolitan character of the population
of the State. rjÂ£
Immediately after the grand march hun

I no diminution in the mass of peonle in
the pavilff-n was discernible. Indeed, oth
ors coming lato krpt the number present
j close to the 10/-O0 mark. The seats for
] spectators remained Jilled, and for each
j danco few les^ than 1^00 people were on
| the floor. The acre and a half of danc
! ing t-'pace was as full as comfort Â¦would
TH-rmit during the earlier hours of the
Â¦ ball until the -lancers began to tire ana
j to depart as the night waned.
A hundred tables were arranged at the
Fldos of the pavilion, screened from the
dancers by the tiers of seats. At these
rrfreshmenth were served, and in this re

i as near faultless as could be. when the

THE iifth annual regatta of the Pa

70-foot classes, after rounding Blos
som Rock buoy, went off in search
of the leeward stakeboat. they were un
able to find It, the reason being the simple
one that it was not there. So, with the
exception of the tT.'enty-footers. none of
the yachts were able to'sall the course
laid down for them. Strict instructions
had been Riven to some one to set out a
leeward stakeboat, but it was not done.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1900.
FULLY ten thousand people lined
the ocean beach yesterday morn-
Ing and watched crews from the
three life saving stations â Golden
Gate. South Side and Kort Point â
give a realistic exhibition of the manner
in which they depart for a ship in dis
tress and take off its endangered passen
gers. Every move made by the gallant
men was closely watched and favorably
commented on. The exhibition was pait
of the programme laid out by the Nativt!
Sons of the Golden .West and like the in
teresting features which had preceded it,
was a great success. Residents of the in
terior and of this city were given a splen
did illustration of the workings of the
Government's life savers, and the excel
lence and value of the service. They Baw
powerfully built men whose cheeks
glowed with health and whose muscles
stood out in their strength, bend to their
oars and make their heavy boats fly
through the water to imaginary points of
danger.
The hour set for the exercises was 9:15.
and before that time tho ocean beach was
crowded with spectators. Two-thirds oi
those on the bench, however, were de
prived of seeing the firing of the life line
and the "rescue" of men from the "rig
ging" by reason of the fact that the com
mittee having the affair in charge forgot
to notify them where that part of the pro
gramme -would be carried out. A disman
tled ship in back of the Golden Gate Life
Saving Station was used to carry out the
exercises. A. large crowd - intently
watched Captain Varney and his crew
rescue men . from the rigging by means
of the "live gun," breeches buoy and life
line, and cheered the men for their en
deavors.
After the exhibition on land the life sav
ers donned their white duck suits and life
preservers and launched their light boat,
which they use for rapid work. It is sink
able, but the brave sailors do not fear
the sea. "When some distance from shore
they deliberately upset the boat" and
clambered on top of it and waited to be
-rescued. The boat from the South Side
station fired a line to the distressed, but

SAN FRANCISCO'S new Hall of
Justice was thrown open for pub-
Ik: inspection yesterday after
noon, the occasion being one of
the many events that marked the
closing day of the semi-centen
nial celebration. The building is a model
home, or at least It will bo when com
pleted, for the clly's police and judiciary
department. When the structure yill be
finished is hard to tell. There is still
much work to be oone, including paint-
Ing and tinting, installing the police sig
nal system* etc. The plasterers have not
yet finisheu their work on the top floor.
Several thousand people, many of them
from out of town, visited the building
between the hours of 2 and 6. There were
no lormal exercises. Olncers were sta
tioned on each lloor to impart such in
formation as the ' more inquisitive de
sired. The Superintendent of Public
Building?, who has directed the work
since ihe Board of Public Works took
control, was much in evidence and seemed
never to tire answering questions.
The building has been nearly four years
in course of construction, progress hav
ing been hampered by a multiplicity of
obstacles. Labor disputes, questions of
expense, architectural changes and wran
gles with contractors are all familiar his
tory in connection with the erection of
this .building. Even now there is dissen
sion between the painting contractors.
George Smith & Son, and the Board of
Public Works, the Jlrm maintaining that
It is entitled to extra money for addi
tional work claimed to have been made
necessary by changes in the partitions.
It Is hoped to have the building ready
for the police department in two weeks.
The present quarters of the department
In the City Hall will be used temporarily
by the southern station, and the plan is
to eventually make the present city
prison the county Jail. The new building
is one of very few In the country having

Celebrated in Paris.
PARIS, Sept. 11.â The members of the
California Commission yesterday cele
brated the admission of California by giv
ing a promenade concert and ball at tho
United States National Pavilion. The
decorations were beautiful and the com
pany was large.
Large crowds witnessed the exhibi
tions at both stations, among them bein^
members of visiting lire departments. All
were much impressed with the neatness
and dispatch with which the work was
carried out. Chief Sullivan and Fire Com
missioner Grady were among the spec
tators.
Besides the engine drills, exhibitions
were given at both yards by picked
teams from the city truck companies. A
realistic performance of scaling the walls
of a burning- building and rescuing its In
habitants by means of the life line was
given, the lire laddies swinging on their
frail supports SO feet above the ground
with the utmost nonchalance.
While the drill at North Beach was in
progress another one of a similar char
acter was taking place at the Corporation
Sard. Channel and Seventeenth streets.
It was in this drill that the record of
the day was madeâ Kngine 10, Captain
Charles Hogan, establishing the mark of
1 minute 2H seconds. Battalion Chief
Shaughnessey. who superintended, de
clared fhat the time was especially praise
worthy, as the tower at Channel and
Seventeenth Is an old-fashioned affair
with narrower manholes, landings and
ladder? than the one at North Beach. It
also requires 2CW feet of hose to be laid,
whereas 50 feet suffices for the latter.
Other performers at Channel and
Seventeenth streets were engines 22 and
26, their time respectively being 1 minute

SHOWED HOW THEY
FIGHT THE FIRE
The halls. have vitrified tile floors. The
building Is well lighted and Is accessible
by entrances on Kearny and Merchant
streets. The building has a tower with
time clock and striker. It cost $300,000 and
is one of the few municipal buildings in
the United States built within the originaJ
appropriation. ' Â¦_ i m
There are four Police Court rooms on
the second floor and three Superior Court
rooms on the third floor. These are all tln
ishod in handsome quartered oak, deli
cately carved and highly polished. Judges
Carroll Cookand Frank Dunne are not one
whit pleased with their new quarters',
which they declare are much too small.
Each Judge has a private oflice and there
is also a jury room attached to each court
room.
In the basement is trie patrolmen's drill
room. 200 feet long, with a shooting gal
lery and shower baths attached. The as
sembly room, Captain Wlttman's office
and the sergeant's rosms are also on the
ground floor. Chief Sullivan has a hand
somely fitted suite of offices in the front
part of the first floor, while Captain Sey
mour and his detective force monopolize
the entire rear. The Commissioners also
have a spacious room on this floor. The
rogues' gallery and sweating box are fea
tures of the detective department's quar
ters. There are any number of cabinets
for filing evidence, warrants, etc., besides
a large vault for the more valuable docu
ments.
There are accommodations for 200 pris

that purpose, which is reached by a door

HOW NATIVE SONS WOUND UP CELEBRATION ON THE DANCING FLOOR
the missile fell short. In order to carry
out the play three of the crew dove for
the rope, but the current was too strong
and they had to return to the floating
boat. They again jumped into the water
and righted the frail craft and balled it
out with a rapidity thstt was astonishing.
They then rowed back to the landing and
brought out their unsinkablo 1â e - boat.
After joining the two other crews the
three proved the excellence, and safety of
their crafts by overturning them and al
lowing the boats to right themselves.

Judge A. R. Cotton, president of the
Society of California Pioneers, responded
to Mayor Phelan's address. He said:
PIOXEERS from all over the
State gathered In Native Sons'
Hall yesterday afternoon at the
reception given in their honor by
the Native Sons. Never have so
many members of the society
been assembled, and, as one of the
speakers sadly said, never will so many
of them be gathered together again on
any occasion. " r-.
The reception was In charge of a special
committee of the Native Sons, of which
Thomas E. Curran was chairman. There
were songs and speeches, and afterward
refreshments, followed by dancing.
The center of the hall was kept clear
for the promenade and dancing-. Three
tiers of chairs were arranged along the
walls, and these were nearly all occupied
by greay-headed Pioneers. Scattered
among them were a few wives of Pioneers
and an occasional Native Son or Native
Daughter.
After a number by the orchestra
Thomas E. Curran Introduced Mayor
Phelan, who delivered the address of wel
come. He spoke In part as follows:
The Society of California Pioneers and the
Xatlve Sons of the Golden West are essentially
alike. Kn.cn Is protective and benevolent, and
above all, each Is historical; each has endeav
ored to keep sacred the memories of the past.
Pioneers, you have blazed the way for us.
You have made all things easy that come after.
You have sown the harvest which we have
reaped. The commonest Instinct of gratitude
would make us -desire to express our feelings
of love, honor and appreciation of the Pioneers.
You are the builders of California. You were
the masterful spirits of the past generation.
Vou pressed on regardless of the dangers of
the frontier and gave to the nation an em
pire on the Pacific Coast. We thank you for
it and welcome you to our hearths and homes.
I have read criticisms of the Pioneers by
those who can only attract when they attack.
Such comment and criticism requires no an
swer. Xot only pluck and courage -was re
fluired in the days of the Pioneers, but knowl
edge as well. The pick of the young men of
the Eastern States came, and they gave us a
commonwealth ready made.
We in these piping times of peace can scarce
ly realize the dangers of the long trip across
the plains or the voyage around the Horn, or
the hardships of the mining camp^. We read
of them, but they were your actual experiences.
When you.? contemplate the great importance
that California has assumed, you must take
great satisfaction in her progress. Everything
that goes to make a State great Is combined In
epitome In California, your handiwork.
the builders should meet those who arÂ» to bt
the rulers. ,
More than fifty years ago 75,000 yonng man
came upon this soil, drawn here by the dis
rnvfry of gold. I am not called upon to apealc
In defense of the character of those men, but
I will !>ay that a more Intellectual and orderly
class of young men never blessed a country
by their advent.
Xow we find a new host In the land, a rreat
company of young men who have had the rood
fortune to have their nativity In California.
Power Is pa?* in it to the new generation; Indeed,
It has largely passed.
The celebration of the semi-centennial has
been a (Treat success. I hope that thÂ« native
sons and daughters will round out the next
fifty years and be here to celebrate the cen
tennial of the State.
Associate Justice "Waiter Van Dyke also
rave an address in behalf of - the Pio
neers,
Miss Lulu Daniells of Alameda sang a
contralto solo. "Golden Harvest," by
Nolr, and responded to an enthusiastic^
encore with Xorrls' "There, Little Girl.
Don't Cry." Alfred TVllkle sang "Queen
of the Earth" and "The Sword of Bun

the neighborhood of Galveston to the
New York offices of the railroad compa

descriptive of the ruin wrought by the

officials received a telegram to-day from
its representative at the scene stating:
"A conservative estimate places the loss
of life at about 1200.- We have lost about
fifty miles of track between Houston and
Qalveston and all railroad bridges over
the bay and all of the wharves and ele
vators at Galveston are gone."
. Railroad men In this city have been dis
cussing with great interest the possibility
that Galveston may be rebuilt on a differ
ent site. It was. rumored to-day that the
Southern Pacific Company would head a
movement to build the city on a spot forty
miles to the nouthwest of its present loca

much apprehension, but the night passed
without the prediction being verified. The

it was almost a gale: at noon it had In

rain, whipping the pools and tearing
things up in a lively manner, yet no seri

aroused to the danger that threatened

CHICAGO, Sept. ll.-There was rejoic
ing to-day a^' Democratic headquarters
over the result cf the election in Maine.
Secretary Walsh and National Committee
man Johnson prepared a. set of figures
based upon their per cent gains In Maine,
upon which they claim the following
States for Bryan:" Maryland by majority
of $000; Indiana, 80,000; Michigan. 35.000;
Minnesota. 2000; Kentucky, 75.000; West
Virginia. 20,000: California. 45.000; Dela
ware, 2000; North Dakota, 2000; Illinois
S7.001.
The Democratic gain In Maine was 23
per cent," said National Oommitteeman
Johnson, "and the Republican loss was
12 per cent, based on the vote cast in
1S96. If similar results are obtained In
other States now chilmed by. the Republi
cans, Mr. Bryan cannot" fall of election.
The ratio, if rnalntained In New York
would not give us that State, but it would
cut down thp Republican majority to 153-

"The result is more than gratifying,
coming after the Republican slump In
Vermont. It shows that the Republicans
of Maine are dissatisfied."
William J. Bryan. w r ho remained In his
room at the Auditorium Hotel all day
preparing a number of speeches â¢which
he will begin Thursday at Fort WaynÂ»Â»,
Ind., declined to discuss the Maine elec

Senator Hanna. whose. time was occu

Vice Chairman Payne of the Republican
National Executive Committee, speaking
for him. said:
"The result In Maine hajÂ» no bearing on
the national election and was in no sense
a disappointment to thf. Republicans. We

Among the speakers assigned was Colo

Adolph B. Spreckela of San Francisco

a precipitation of 4.23 inches, most ,of
which fell between 11:30 last night and
7:30 this morning.' The rains' caused sev
eral bad washouts on the Great Northern

LOCAL SUBSCRIPTIONS TO
THE GALVESTON FUND
AUSTIN. Tex.. Sept. 11.â The storm which brought such destruction of
property and caused j=uch loss of- life at Galveston also left death
and disaster In its wake over a strip' of Texas 300 miles wide and
ir.0 miles inland from the gulf. Reports from remote towns and
country districts which had been cut off from the outside world by
collapse of teloRTaph and telephone wires were received here to-day,
and they show that the Iops of life on the .mainland, exclusive of Gal
veston. will apRri-Kato fully 300 people, and that the property losses will ag
prrprato millions of dollars. Every house in Missouri City but two was
Mfiwn down. ar.<l the several hundred homel^p? people are destitute. Three!

Several convicts were Injured at the Clemens convict farm. All the farm
b'jildinps were wrecked. Several people were killed at Caney and Elliott
and much property destroyed. Fourteen nepro convicts employed on a plan

the town of Wlasco. at the mouth of the Brazos River, was destroyed.
El-even people lost the^ir lives. At Camp Hatvley it 5s reported that over

Most Atrocious Acts Committed toy
a Band of Oranken Negroes asid
Some WMtesoif tihe Lower Strata,
DALLAS, Sept. 11.â A horrible story is told by Dallas citizens who returned
to-night from Galveston. They declare that negroes and many white per
sons are hourly committing the most atrocious acts of vandalism. J. N.
Grlswold. division freight, agent of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe. who
was In that city during the storm and had a narrow escape from death,
said:
"Ears and flnpers bearing diamonds wore hacked off with pocketknlves and
the members placed in the pockets of the vandals. The bodies of women who
wore fine clothes were stripped of their last thread and left to fester in the sun.
The residences left standing" have been broken Into and jewelry and silver-plate
stolen. I saw a negro woman carrying a large basket of silverware that was
not hers.
"At Texas City I saw an old man considerably under the influence of liquor.
From his pocket protruded a roll of bills as big as my arm, which he claimed to
have found. Upon all sides this horrible work is going on. The offenders are
generally negroes, although there are some white men who have demonstrated
that they are sufficiently devoid of honesty and manhood to participate in those
ghoulish deeds. As soon as the storm subsided the negroes stole all the liquor
they could get. and. beastly drunk, proceeded with their campaign of vandalism.
Troops are needed at once. If they are not sent without delay, God help the sur
vivors in Galveston." -
This is confirmed by a dozen men of the highest standing here.

ULTIMATUM ISSUED TO
THE MINE OPERATORS
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 11.â The trou
bles of the Siberian yold mining expedi
tion, under the command â¢ of George D.
Roberts, that left San Francisco on the
Samoa in June, and which ended disas
trously to the promoters, will in all like
lihood be transferred :o Uncle Sam's care.
. The Call .this morning '. published the
story of the Samoa's troubles. Further
details of the affair have been received
from Nome. The vessel was placed hi
charge'of American soldiers and the sen
sational situation was | Investigated by
Colonel Evans and Lieutenant Jarvis of
the Treasury Department. As a result of
this investigation tho Cossacks -will' be
sent back to Russia, while the Americans
will return j to San j Francisco .In the Sa
moa. ' The affair will bo reported to the
authorities at ' Washington and corre
spondence probably opened, with the Rus
sian Government to ascertain what Rus
sia's future position will be in regard to
American concessionists*.
-Last winter George D. Roberts, a for
mer California mining man, visited the
large European cities, interesting French
and English capital to prospect the coast
of Siberia. Pooling issues with a Russian
syndicate, represented by Colonel Woular
larsky, a concession was secured from thp
Russian Government of 10.000 miles of
coast. The steamer Samoa was purchased
and the expedition outfitted in San Fran
cisco, among those composing It were
Roberts, the organizer: Mr. Dadoune
ditch. a civil engineer representing Woul
arlarsky; John A., White, a London capi
talist, and a corps of mining experts. The
Americans aboard numbered eight.
The Samoa, Captain Johnson, left San
â¢ Special Dispatch to The Call,
Francisco June 8, arriving at Nome July
5'u A J^ T -, a few days the vessel sailed for
the Siberian coast. Two weeks later she
was again at Nome, and there was talk of
dissensions between Roberts and Da
douneditch. The rumors, however could
not be authenticated and the Samoa again
put to sea. She returned to Nome for
tho third time on August 21.
It is learned that when the Samoa was
off the coast of Siberia the Russian trans
port Yakout was sighted and hailed and
at the instance of Dadouneditch thirty
Russians were transferred from tho
transport to the Samoa. Dadounedttch
said the Russians were laborers, but as
soon a3 they were aboard he volunteered
the information that he had now thlrtv
armed Cossacks' at his back and proposed
to depose Roberts as head of the-expedi
tion. He also disclosed the lact that not
only was ho the representative of the
Russian syndicate but also an agent of
the Russian Government and that the
Cossacks aboard were soldiers.
Then It-was that the Americans learned
that the Russians proposed to control the
Samoa and dispose of the Americans
After consultation the Americans deter

sented for Burned Property Dur

WASHINGTON, Sept. ll.-Clalms ag
gregating $2,500,000 or more have arisen
in connection with the efforts made prin
cipally in Hawaii to prevent the bubenic
plague from securing a foothold In this
country and Its outlying possessions by
burning down a considerable part of tha
Japanese and ChinesÂ© quarters, where It
was thought the disease might find lodg
ing.
Two Japanese residents are said to have
lost their lives, furniture and practically
all belongings. The loss is estimated at
$300,000. The Chinese loss was estimated
at about $2,000,000. The Japanese Consul
General at Hawaii first brought the mat
ter to the attention of the Hawaiian au
thorities, asking that the losses incurred
by Japanese subjects be reimbursed to
ttiem. President AIcKinley gave the neces
sary authority to Governor Dole to ap
point a commission of five members to
pass upon all claims of this nature, but
on objection Â¦ of the claimants this fell
through. The authorities here feel that
It Is a matter which Hawaii should ad
just, and moreover there Is no fund avail
able for stich losses. The subject Is un
der consideration, however, and It Is
hoped wine means may be adopted by co
operation of Washington and Honolulu
for adjusting the matter.

"Who killed Mahony?
Vv'hat were the motives?
These are the questions that the Sheriff
of San Joaquin and his deputies are try
ir.pr to unravel.
Here are the facts In the case: The body
cf a man. who had been about 30 years
of age. was found yesterday morning by
Â« roadside near Tracy. The remains were
peventy-five feet from the railroad
tracks, that are fenced off from the road.
The dead man lay face downward, the
Etirfened fingers, claw-like, clutching the
eod, the limbs distorted. The pose was
That of a man who had suffered Intense
death aeony. When the Coroner's men
turned the body over they perceived that
there was a deep and lacerated wound on
the right temple. When they, later, fur
ther examined the dead, they found that
the man's neck and also his collar bone
had been broken. The dead man's wrists
w re bruised, as though a rope had been
wound about them. Near the body a
deputy sheriff found a linen collar.
cn;inp'â¬-d and torn, as though it had been
vrenched from the wearer's neck. The
collar had not belonped to the dead man.
for the shirt en the body was a soft gar
ment, with collar attached. The dead
man's coat was found on the railroad
track, about 1CK) feet from where the body
lay. About the spot where the body was
found the earth bore the fresh imprints
of a horse's hoofs and of wheels, the lat
ter evidently those of a cart.
With these slender clews the Sheriff and
hii= men began the unraveling of the mys
tery.
To-day the identity of the dead man
was fully established by II. F. Maas, a.
San Francifco undertaker, who Is a
brother-in-law to the late Mahony. Maas
was rather reticent. He stated to the
Bberlff, however, so far as is known, that
Mahony left San Francisco on Friday
last on "a business trip to the Interior, tak
ing with him $120. Mahony. said Maas.
sometimes bought horses in the country,
and usuaily went prepared to make a pur
chase in case he saw an animal that suit
ed him.
Now as to the four theories concerning
Mahony'f death.
First, there are those who believe that
Mahony may have purchased a high
fpirited horse and started to drive across
to Livermore; that he had wrapped the
reins about his wrist to hold in the horse:
that he was thrown from the cart on
which he was riding: that he fell In such
a manner as to break his collarbone and
reck, and that the marks on the wrist
that look as though they had been caused
by a rope were made when the animal
tugged on the lints.
But no one can be found who sold a,
horse to Mahony in the last few days; no
ono can be found who saw him driving on
the road. And the theory does not ac
cour.t for the finding of Mahony's coat
cs the track 103 feet from where his body
Ujr* nor for the fact that only fourteen
cents was found in the dead man's pock
ets, and no receipts for money paid out.
The second theory, which seems to have
r.o basil in fact so far. Is that Mahony
had a quarrel with some one and war,
dr-r^i off into the country; that he was
follcwÂ«-<i and plain. These theorists in
cline to the revenge motive, and hint
darkly at a San Francisco complication
that msy yet be- unraveled.
Th*> third theory is that of accident or
robbery <->n the train. Those holding to
that beUef ?ay that he might- have fallen
from th<? train, or that some one robbed
him on the train and threw him off.
The Sheriffs office disposes of this the
ory by pointing out that a man with a
broken neck could not walk seventy-five
feet and climb a fence before he died.
The fourth theory Is that of the Sheriff
and his deputies?. It is that of murder.
with robbery as the motive. They be
lieve that Mahony was lured to the
place where he was found, the murderer
or murderers knowing that he was pos
sessed of money: that when attempt at
robbery was made Mahony resisted;
that he was then struck with some heavy,
blunt instrument; that when he had
fallen his pocket3 were rifled; that his
coat was taken to the spot where found,
and, after the pockets had been searched,
thrown on the railway track.
The Sheriff's theory sc-ems the most
plausible, judging from the fact*.
The Sheriff Is proceeding In line with
his belief, and one of his deputies is now
at the scene of the crime. A resident In
that vicinity has been found who saw Ma
hony, or a man closely resembling him.
In the company of a stranger on Sunday.
No one has been found who saw Mahony
Jr. Stockton recently.
It is also said that the Sheriff's office
has obtained some evidence that Is being
withheld at present.
It may be that the torn collar will fur
nish the clew that will lead to the discov
erv of the murderer, even as the laundry
mark on one of Black Bart's handker
chirfs ended the road agent career of that
notorious highwayman.
BELIEVE IT IS MUBDEE,
Relatives of the Dead Drayman Ad-
here to That Theory.
The s'.ners of James W. Mahony, the
young San Franciscan whose body was
found on the road near Tracy, Cal., be-
I'evc and assert as their opinion that their
brother was the victim of a thug. They
are unable to give any reason for this
opinion other than the fact that the ap
pearance of the body indicates he was
killed for whatever money he had on his
person. Mahony's body was brought to
this city last night and now reposes In
the undertaking establishment of H. F.
Maass. S17 Mission -street. The remains
will lie- interred in a few days and the
funeral will be strictly private.
The umlmcly.dcath of Mahony has been
a terrible shock to his young: wife and his
family. According: to his sisters he left
for hi? office Friday morning In the best
of spirits. On leaving his residence on
Third street he called on his parents, who
reside at 3C2 Urannan street, and during
his conversation with his brother and
sisters gave no indication that he was
p>>irig out of town or that he was de
spondent. It i? their theory that on ar
riving at his office deceased found impor
tant business awaiting him which neces
sitated his leaving town immediately, and
that he was unable to notify his. wife and
did not think it necessary to "apprise her
of his departure, a* he expected to return
the following day; that while In Stockton
he collected money due him for drayace.

Come again from the m'ountains and "the valley*
from the boom towns and the cow counties, ye native
sons and ye adopted sons, and bring the gir!s with
you. San Francisco is yours to count on.
It is doubtful if any other land on earth could have
gathered fo numerous a crowd of. men and women,
under circumstances cf such freedom and absence of
restraint, that would linve carried out all the festivi
ties of three successive days with so little to mar or
disturb the pleasure cf any* one. It was a wide open
town that greeted the visitors, but it was the openness
of an honest hospitality, and those who entered were
fitted to enjoy all thnt was best in it. From first to
last the whole affair was bright, musical and beauti
tiful. Every one of cur visitors was all right. It i?
evident there are no bad Californians. Some may be
better than others, but they are all good.
It is an old saying that the best ornaments of. a
home are the friends ihst visit it. Certain it is that no
Otter adornment r-o dearly manifests the character of
the famiiy that occupies the home. A man is known
by bis friends. The character of a city is distinguished
by the kind of people who resort to it, and by the
tray they enjoy themselves when they get there.
Judged by that standard, San FraiTcisco can congratu
late herself on the visitors she has just entertained.
They came from all parts of the Pacific Coast. They
were of nearly all races. Most of them were strangers
to one another. They met in the jostling of the
thronged streets and in the unconventionally of a
free for sll jubiicc. Yet a common spirit of patriotism
varmed their hearts and they became friends on sight.'
There was geniality, cordiality, good ; nature every
where. Never was the true Californian manner of
give and take on equal terms and with a joyous good
will more abundantly exhibited than in the general
gatherings of the pa=t four days.
OUR visitors are going home. They have made
the city lively rnd uproarious for three of the
maddest and merriest days that ever an Ameri
can community knew! They made for us a halcyon
end vociferous time, and we speed them on the way
hrr.ie with the best wishes that ever attended a throng
GOOD-BY TO OUR VISITORS.
The total registration up to last Friday evening
was 48,031, and it is estimated that" the total regis
tration will be about 72,000, consequently there re
main 24,000 names to be registered between now and
September 26, when registration will cease. It will
be seen there is no time to spare. Get your name on
the register, or you will have no vote on election day,
and the fault will be your own.
It is to be borne in mind that a wholly new regis
tration is required this year. Those who have not
registered since last January and fail to register be
fore the expiration of 4he time fixed by law will for
feit the right to vote in November. Registrar Walsh
has provided every facility for registration, so that
the performance of lhe duty will entail no inconve
nience if it be promptly attended to; In the closing
days, however, there is sure to be a rush.
WE have completed the three days' celebration
of California's jubilee, and now that the
glorious interlude is over we return to politics.
It is high time for the people of this city'to give se
rious consideration to their public duties. The first
thing to be done is to see to it that every good citizen
registers. The bosses will be sure to get the names
of all their touts and toughs on the roll and an equal
energy should be shown by the better elements of the
community. Those who have not yet registered
shoul3 do so at once, and those who have should
urge their friends to attend to the duty.
NOW FOR REGISTRATION.
After urging the construction of the Nicaragua
Canal, the President takes up the trust problem and
points out that some of these combinations of capital
"are dangerous conspiracies against the public good
and should be made the subject of prohibitory or
penal legislation." He goes on to say, "Honest co
operation of capital is necessary to meet new business
conditions and to extend our rapidly increasing" for
eign trade, but conspiracies and combinations .in-
The one blot upon the otherwise bright record of
the country is the fact that 90 per cent of our imports
and exports are now carried by foreign ships and
that we pay annually to foreign ship-owners over
$165,000,000. The President recalls that he has re
peatedly urged legislation designed to upbuild our
merchant marine and repeats the declaration: "We
shall fail to realize our opportunities if we com
placently regard only matters at home and blind our
selves to the necessity of securing our share in the
valuable carrying trade of the world."
Passing from that issue the President rapidly but
clearly reviews the benefits which have resulted from
the protective tariff and the financial legislation of
Congress. These benefits are noted in the expansion
of our industries at home and our commerce abroad,
in the augmented revenues of the nation and the ad
vanced prosperity of the people of all sections. He
notes that, "unless, something unforeseen occurs to
reduce our revenues or to increase our expenditures,
Congress at its next session should reduce taxation
very materially." ; /" C
The letter does not undertake to decide or to discuss
the relative importance of issues, but the people are
reminded that one pledge of a platform is as binding
a? 4 another, that the candidates who have promised to
overthrow the gold siandard and what they call "a
conspiracy against the welfare of the human race,"
will be obliged to fulfill the promise should they come
into power, and therefore the voters have to decide
whether they will "hazard the overthrow of the wise
financial legislation of the past year and revive the
danger of the silver standard, with all of the inevitable
xvils of shattered confidence and general disaster,
which justly alarmed and aroused them in 1896."
The President begins by directing attention to the
fact that, despite the efforts of the opposition to shift
the controversy from its natural ground, the chief
issue of the time is the preservation of our financial
integrity, industrial prosperity and established peace
and .order. He reminds the country v < that the op
ponents of the gold standard have renewed the strug
gle for its overthrow. He quotes the declarations of
the three silver parties reasserting the policies they
advocated four years ago. "Thus," he says, "the
issue is presented. It will be noted that the demand
is for the immediate restoration of the free coinage of
silver at 16 to I." Then, with a light satiric touch, he
adds: "If another issue is paramount, this is imme
diate. It will admit of no delay and will suffer no
postponement."
PRESIDENT McKlNLEY'S letter, published
on Monday and reviewed in a general way
yesterday, should be carefully studied by
every voter in the country. It will suffice the Re
publican party for whatever educational docu
ments the voters may need in this campaign.
It deals with every political issue of the time
and illumines them all. There is not a problem
ignored, nor a single attempt to evade any of 'their
complexities. Every declaration is fair, honest, manly
and statesmanlike. The letter will rank among the
ablest of our Presidential state papers and will be read
r.ot only now but hereafter for its lucid statements of
the issues at stake in this contest.
McKlNLEY'S ACCEPTANCE.
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
it ; s hardly necessity to point out that such contri
btrtions as California's may make to the cause should
pa,ss through a State committee in order that it may
show forth clearly to the people of Texas the sym
pathy of California. Governor Gage in this emer
gency is doing the right thing at the risht time in the
right way, and all Californians should support him
in it.
From the reports that have been received it may be
ncceptc.l as certain that the stricken people of Texas
will rteed all the help the generous people of this and
other State? can piv* them. The disaster has been
me of the most appalling that ever befell any part of
the United States. There arc thousands in distress,
snd the destruction of property has been so extensiv*
that the residents of the cities where the disasters oc
curred v.ill hardly be able to give effective help to
their unfortunate neighbors who have lost their all.
Consequently outside help should be given in the fu!l
measure of that abundant generosity that i? so char
acteristic of the American people.
To the inveterate faker charity is just as good a
gold brick as any to iÂ«. ork off upon a sympathetic and
unsuspecting community. It is safe to say that some
of the schemers are already preparing to start sub
scriptions for the Galveston sufferers and have laid
their plans for working the public. The action of
Governor Gage will have the good effect of baffling
such schemers. It gives to the generous an assurance
that a responsible committee will be appointed to act
for all California in this emergency, and that all con
tributions they make will be devoted solely for the
purpose intended nnd r.ot be used for self-advertising
or for self-er.richment by some self-organized charity
It i? gratifying that the Governor has taken this ac
tion. It is well known lhat in matters of this kind
there is always a ho?t of self-seekers rushing forward
to pose as philanthropists marily for the notoriety
they will derive from it. but sometimes for the chance
of defrauding the generous. That class of persons
have become by this time fairlj* familiar to the public,
?.nd yet in even- grave disaster where the sympathies
of the generous are widely aroused a considerable
number of them succeed in making a very good har
vest for themselves out of it.
GOVERNOR GAGE has telegraphed to the
Governor of Texas asking if aid from Califor
nia will be needed in providing relief for the
people of Gal vest pn and other parts of Texas that
have suffered from the storms of Saturday and Sun
c?.y. and in what way such a^^i^ta^cc, if desired, can
be best arranged. When the reply conies the Gov
ernor will act promptly in arranging for relief, and
the people cf California will then have an official and
responsible con-.mittec to collect and transmit to the
Texas authorities ilxir contributions to the relief
fund.

At the last moment a telegram was sent

and go direct from there to Nome. From
the gold fields the vessel will bring back
a load of stranded miners to San Fran

The United States transport Lawton,
which was to have sailed at noon for
Nome, was detained in the stream yester
day over a little trouble In the steward's
department. During Inspection some of
the rooms in the forecastle were found to
be in an untidy condition. The chief
steward was called to account, and he ex
plained that the men were changing quar
ters and that therefore the untidy condi
tion of the rooms was excusable. The in
spector did not think so, and the regult
was that the Lawton had to tie.up in the
stream until a new steward was got
aboard. The old steward came ashore in
one of Peterson's launches. All his men
would have followed him, but they were
not given a chance to get over the side.

â¢ California Republicans should study the Maine and
the Vermont vote carefully. They will perceive that
the feeling of overconfidence which was indulged
there without harm cannot be risked in this State.
We have no normal Republican majorities of from
25,000 to 30,000 votes to rely upon. In California
every vote will be needed, j It is true that all signs
give reasons for an unshaken belief in the triumphant
re-election of McKinley, but if the victory is to be
as sweeping as was that of four years ago, the Repub
licans will have to put more energy in the campaign
than they have done up to this time.
Four years ago in a speech at Knoxville Bryan
said: "If there is any one who believes the gold stan
dard is a good thing, or that it must be maintained,
I warn him not to cast his vote for me, because I
promise him 'it will not be maintained in this coun
try longer than I am able to get rid of it." Such was
the declaration, and though Bryan has dodged the
money issue to some extent in this campaign, he has
not recanted that utterance nor said anything that can
give a believer in the gold standard the slightest ex
cuse for voting for him.
It can hardly be . necessary to point out to intelli
gent men that there is an important lesson to bo
drawn from the Maine and the Vermont vote. That
apathy in the Republican ranks due to overconfidence,
of which we have heard so much in reports from the
East, has shown itself in the voting of those States.
Why should there be any falling off from the Repub
lican vote of four years ago? The Bryanite menace
to the welfare of the country is as serious now as
then; indeed it is even more dangerous, for it is now
cloaked and disguised and will deceive many, people.
Therefore it behooves Republicans to be more alen
than ever. They cannot afford at this time to take
chances in any State or in any Congressional dis
trict
Thus on the surface everything is encouraging. It
is to be noted, however, that the Republican vote is
less than it was four years ago and the Democratic
vote has increased. A similar state of things oc
curred in Vermont, with this curious difference â in
Vermont the Democratic gain was less than the Re
publican loss, while in Maine it is greater. Such per
centages of loss and gain have no effect upon the
strong Republican nnjorities in those two States, but
if anything like an equal change in the voting takes
place in the close States the re-election of McKinley
will be by a narrow margin.
by her vote on Monday has confirmed
/ \ and emphasized the lesson taught by the vote
of Vermont last week. The Republicans have
carried the State and elected every Congressman by
an overwhelming majority. The Legislature will be
very nigh solidly Republican, and the re-election ot
Senator Frye is assured.
THE MAINE ELECTION.
Editor The Call-Most of the Inscrip
tions proposed for the "SPRECKELS
ARCH OP HARMONY" are too verbose;
it should be very concise.
The above name is appropriate, because
the word harmony refers to the arch as
well as to the music which will be ren
dered under it. I safest this inscription:
"San Francisco thanks its fellow citi
zen, Claus Spreckels. for this gift." And
that the date, "September Â£>, 1900," be
added. *
Let the letters be clear so any one can
read them and large enough that spec
tacles v.ill not be required. Thus will the
world learn that we appreciate the gener
csity of our people. Yours truly.

HONOLULU. Sept. i.â Sunday was the
sl.\ty-second anniversary of the birth of
Liliuokalani, the former Queen of these
islands. Early in the morning, she was
serenaded by the government band and
Hawaiian boys, who played and sang sev
eral of her compositions. A notable inci
dent in connection with the former sub
jects of the ex-Queen â and one which is
very suggestive for political reasons
owing to the indiscreet vaporlngs of un
intelligent followers of hersâ was that
while she declined to rise from her chair
while "Hawaii Ponol," the former nation
al anthem, was played, shÂ° set the exam
ple by rising when Captain Berger played
the "Star-Spangled Banner." This lesson
will not be lost upon her people. Later
on the ex-Queen attended and communi
cated at the services of St. Andrew's Epis
copal Cathedral. *
On Saturday the primaries of the Re
publicans were held on Oahu and over
1500 votes were polled by the precinct
clubs out of a membership of about dou
ble that number, a very fair proportion
of whom are native born Hawaiians. The
object was to elect permanent otllcers and
delegates* to the district convention on the
6th and 7th. It is generally conceded that
Colonel Sam Parker stands the best
chance of being selected as delegate to
Congress by the convention, as it is an
open secret that the administration at
Washington desires a native born Ha
waiian of character and wealth to occupy
that position. The numerous candidates
in the lield on the Democratic and Inde
pendent Hawaiian side precludes the elec
tion of their man if Colonel Parker ob
tains the nomination. J. O. Carter,
brother of the late H. A. P. Carter, a. for
mer Minister of Hawaii to Washington,
emphatically declares that he will not
serve for the short term; Robert Wilcox
and his followers are making themselves
unpopular and Prince David "fights shy."
The first I>abor day's celebration in
Honolulu -was a grand success. A few of
the floats were of especially elaborate de
sign, but the two that Dleased the most
were those containing happy little school
children who cheered and sang and waved
American flags all along the lengthy
route.
At the termination of the street parade
it was dismissed in the capitol (palace)
grounds, and eloquent speeches were de
livered by United States District Attorney
HaJrd and Messrs. Lorin Andrews and
Georgp A. Davis.
At Kapiolani Park in the afternoon
there were athletic sports and horse races
with no charge of admission. In the even
ing at the armory there was a free dance,
at which upward of 3000 attended.
Considerable unfavorable comment is
being made on the announced intention of
High Sheriff Brown to enforce the Sun
day blue laws and to close restaurants,
ice cream parlors, etc., at 7 p. m. The
press is fighting it so bitterly that Mr.
Brown will probably pause.

LILIUOKALANI'S
GOOD EXAMPLE
TO HAWAIIANS
Such arc the salient/featurcs of the paper. The
document is one that will be continually under review
and discussion throughout the campaign. It can and
will stand every test that may be applied to it by
honest minds. It gives a bold challenge to the three
silver and calamity parties that have united under
Bryan's leadership and presents to the voters of the
country a frank and full statement of the grounds
upon which the Republican party asks their suffrages
in the coming election..
; Coming to what the Kansas City platform calls "the
paramount issue," the President reviews what has
been done for Porto Rico and gives an able sum
mary of the events leading up to the present situation
in the Philippines. Upon that issue. he says: "Are
our opponents against the treaty? If so, they must be
reminded that it could not have been ratified in the
Senate but for their assistance. The Senate which
ratified the treaty and the Congress which added its
sanction by a large appropriation comprised Senators
and Representatives of the people of ( all parties."
Furthermore the President says: "There is a strain of
ill-concealed hypocrisy in the anxiety to extend the
constitutional guarantees to the people of the Philip
pines, while their nullification's openly advocated at
l'ome. Our opponents may distrust themselves, but
they have no right to discredit the good faith of the
majority of the people who are opposed to them."
tended to restrict business, create monopolies and
control prites should be effectually restrained." Such
declarations certainly satisfy all that reasonable men
ask on the subject and completely refute the assertion
of the Bryanites that the Republican party is the sup
porter of trusts. 9
"The same rii'e holds sood of women

""when talking to another man over the
telephone, a fellow speaks in a curt, bust

air of taking off his hat. and tnere s no
mistaking that either. So soon as a man
is satisfied upon the great preHminai/
telephonic point, 'Who Is it?' he instaritly

two tones and anyone within hearing can
instantly and involuntarily determine
whether it's a man or a woman that nas

Whenever Mr. Croker appears in the campaign to
encourage his branded propert;,', Mr. Bryan, there
will arise before the mind's eye Hill's picture of the
boss, who cannot make a platform, nor define a
principle, nor formulate a policy, but wljo on no oc
cupation has become a millionaire, with an establish
ment in England that rivals the scat of the Howards
and a following that would have made a feudal Baron
turn verdant with envy.
The affair foreshadows another quarrel and divi
sion in New York Democracy. That party has had
many historic splits, including the Hunkers and Barn
burners, the straights rind locofocos, the swallow-tails
and short hairs. Just what name shall express the
coming division none can foresee. Perhaps, from
the suggestive name of Mr. Croker, it may be the
frogs and polly.vogs.
But, for all this anger of Mr. Croker, Hill's- ar
raignment stands and the picture he drew will not
soon be forgotten.
It does not seem to occur to Croker that no man
can be a leader who has first to be recognized by
him. The man who docs the recognizing is the real
leader, as Croker no doubt is. He permitted Bryan
to be nominated: in fine, he recognized, and branded
him. He issued a permit to Mr. Bryan, gave him a
l'cense. so to speak. ?nd without that Bryan could
not transact his business.
This means that no man can be a leader unless Mr.
Crokcr chooses to recognize him. He may have all
the qualities of leadership, but is not to lead until
branded with the true Croker brand.
What is exquisitely funny about it is that Crokrr
confessed everything in Hill's description by saying:
"If it wasn't for these things I would have recognized
him as a leader long ago!"
In fact. Mr. Croksr was mad. He got what the
boys call a hot box. His indignation rose to h:s lips
in impolite and improper language. He called Mr.
I Till deceitful, tricky, a picayune and peanut politician
and an untruthful sneak, and declared that if he lived
in New York City he would decline to make him a
captain of a district in the Tammany organization!
In his speech Mr. Hill ventured to discuss the boss
in politics as a person inimical alike to labor and to
rest. He drew a few vivid^ pictures, vocal vitascopes.
in fact, of the party boss, toiling not nor spinning, yet
wearing purple and fine linen, patent leather shoes
and a rich beefsteak complexion, all at the expense of
the taxpayers and the people. He pictured the boss
as controlling appointments to office, public con
tracts from the feeding of prisoners to the burial of
paupers, privileges to corporations, and as growing
sleek and oily on the assessment of sin, folly and
crime for the privilege of existing and preying un
their victims. Hill mentioned no names, but he had
only to reach down in the numerous pigeonholes of
his memory and tap his experiences in New York poli
tics, from the time he was a lieutenant of Tweed until
he rose to the Senate, to find such apt illustrations as
comprised an excellent likeness of Mr. Croker. Next
day Mr. Crok'er recognized his portrait and was.
guilty of the indiscretion of admitting that Hill is an
artist and can draw true to the life.
IUjX-SENATOR HILL indulged in the perilous
. luxury of orator}' on Labor day. He selected
; â â¢ Troy for the scene, and it is the opinion - of
Mr. Crokcr, leader of the party, that he entered Troy
as a wooden horse, full of defiance, insult and con-

politics will have to join the Republican; party this

has a future worth sharing.
Republicans may be sure of victory this year if
they will work, but if many stay at, home and leave
the work to others there will be a surprise party for

tacles belonging to the Chinaman in his
pockets.
As the crowd gathered the Chinese
woman, the sole occupant of the room
in which the fire started, appeared at one
of the windows. She could make no exit
through the door and piteously appealed
for assistance. Officers Nelson, Dinan,
Connolly, Fowle and McNamara were
soon on the scene and while some of
them secured a ladder, the others reached
a window of an adjacent building. The
woman was taken from the burning room
and passed to the rescuers In the other
building-. She had been almost suffocated
by smoke.
Shortly before 6 o'clock a lamp exploded
in the room of Yong Hing. In a few sec
onds the blazing oil had spread over
everything and flames and smoke issued
from the windows. An alarm was turned
in by Officer James Cavanaugh from box
17 and the lire apparatus was soon on the
scene.
Sin Suey, a Chinese woman, had a nar

the game Four small and harmless
bombs were set off by the Dudes with
out any result. Fiiz, with the aid of the
team back of him, nullified every other
abortive attempt at stick work of which
Ewlng's men v.ore guilty. "Chief"
Korchers did antics upon the Oakland
t-Oab, fcsLit his tribesmen were a "bad lot of
Indians." In one inning they committed
lour tanful error*, whicn, combined with
lour San Francisco hits, made Hank
n:ore than jubilant as he counted off the
six runs which the "IXoofian" at the bell
v.orked cfi slowly upon the crowd.
This sextuplet of runs happened in the
eighth inning and clinched victory for the
local team beyond peradventure. Not un
til the third try at the bat did Hank send
a runner from the rubber and round to
it again. The '"Fireman" found to his
iikii,? a "hand-me-ovcr" of the Chiefs
stock and 'was safe at Ilrst. He stole one
en MangvTina, soon after going to third
on a passed ball. Hildcbrand helped to
socre him after he got into the running
en four bad balls. A double steal it was
that put 'Frisco on the board.

NEW YORK. Sept. 11.â There was a larger
attendance of members of the Stock Exchange
at the openlns of the board this morning than
for several months past. This was due partly
to the returnlm: tide from summer vacations,
but there seemed to be an expectation among
brokers and operators, which was not realized,
that some renewal of Interest In securities was
about to be shown. London bought on a mod
crate scale here, that market being encouraged
by continued case of money, and this helped
the recovery from the opening decline here.
The enthusiasm of the professional traders was
fhort lived, however. They created a slight
flurry in the coalers, marking up New Jer
sey. Central 2>4 and Reading first preferred a
point on the prevalent belief that a way would
be found to adjust the differences of the min
ers and coal operators. There was some short
coverins in Sugar, People's Gas and Brooklyn
Transit, these three stocks maintaining their
conspicuous pcsitlon In the trading. The bet
ter comprehension of the Texas disaster and
St. Paul's decreased earnings proved depress
ing factors and helped to overcome the early
advance. Closing prices showed few important
chanses.
A stlffenlne In the rate for call loans to 2
per cent attracted attention to the possibili
ties of a money squeeze during the autumn.
The rate tell back to VA per cent when the
banks came into the Stock Exchange with un
placed balances late In the day. The preva
lent ease of money is evidently due to the ex
ceodlnsly Â»:canty demand and any active specu
lation will probably make rapid inroads upon
the resources of the banks.
The bond market was quiet and featureless.
Total pairs, par value. $910,000.
United States old 4s advanced ii and the 3s
registered V4 and do. coupon % per cent in
the bid price.

at the Sacramento Gathering,
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 11.â The seventh
annual convention of the California Dairy
Association began here to-day and will
be in session three da5"s in the Senate
chamber of the Capitol. There was a
small attendance at 10 o'clock, the hour
named, and an adjournment was taken
until 1:30 after the appointmet of com
mittees on resolutions and order of busi

Justice Hirsch set Gomez's bail at $2000.
Jack Ortega is to plead before the Super
ior Court to-morrow, when it Is said his
attorney will move for a change of venue.
SAX JOSE, Sept. 11.â Joseph Gomez,
one of the principal witnesses against
Pugilist Jack Ortega, who is charged
Â¦with assaulting Grace Gamble, has been
arrested on a charge of perjury. The
complainant Is Harry Cordell, an em
ploye of Ortega's brother. The warrant
was issued by Justice Hirsch of Santa
Clara, all the local Justices refusing to do
so. Gomez saw Ortega's horse and buggy
pass under an electric light at about the
time of the assault. A man and little girl
were in the buggy. He could not identify
the persons, but he was positive the rig
was Ortega's. The day of the preliminary
examination Milledge Ortega, a brother of
Jack, invited Gomez into a saloon and
there told him if he did not change his
testimony the Ortega family would "do"
him. Gomez reported the matter to the
court and Milledge was arrested for in
t'midating a witness. He was subse
quently released.

Matter Now Said to Be Under Dis
cussion and a Decision Soon
Expected.
PARIS. Sept. 11.â The Journal des De
bats says on the authority of a dejSuty
who recently discussed the situation with
several cabinet ministers that a portion
of tho cabinet Is in favor of the cabinet
resigning in a body before the reassem-
Ming ol the parliament on the ground
that the government has accomplished
the task for which it was constitutedâ
that the Dreyfus affair is ended, that the
republic has been placed on a firm basis,
that the exposition is about to be closed,
and thai it would be best to resign in
prder to clear thf political situation.
In case of the cabinet's resigning, it
is further afÂ«ertori. It will do away with
numerous interpellations on strikes, ac
cidents at the exposition and other acci
dents which threaten to cause stormy de
bates in the chamber, and President Lou
bet would form a cabinet of Republican
concentration, not Including any of the
present ministers.
A decision, it is believed, will probably
be taken at an early meeting of the cab
inet. â¢

T. J. Cror.in'5 younp hound Vandal cap
tured the ppocial holiday stake at Union

Vandal partly atoned for the upset he
gave the talent last Saturday. In the
FUtority the youngster was rated among
the top-notchcrs und was held at the stiff
price of 3 to 1 in the long odds books. He
Â¦was drawn against Reilly's IZarly Dawn
cjid was rcade a pronounced favorite in
the course at S to 1. with a heavy back
iiigr. But he lost and the sympathy of
evt-n the winners were with Cronin.

The hares cere a sure enough fast lot
and in two-thirds of the goes in the run
down beat the hounds to the escapes and
in many instances got away after three
or four, points had been scored.
In the course between Onward and EP'TO
in the fourth round one of the jacks
furnished goinp and excitement piwuÂ»,.i
for half a dozen courses. Slim lost sight
of the hare as be was slipped and Onward
went it alone. The best part of the work
was done in front of the grandstand and
ithe hare worked his pursuer tantalizingiy.
Onward scored 14 points before Slim
Joined in and then showed his fast, game
work by piling up S to his opponent's 5.
Two relif f dogs were turned loos=e and the
trainers tried to corner the hare, but H
W2S too full of tricks and turns. It finally
pasred Onward, who was almost at a
standstill and was snappeu up.
The work jÂ»ut Onward out of the run

New York Cotton Market.
XEW TORK, Sept. 11.â There was a marked
change in the order of things on the New York
Cotton Exchange to-day. While early opera
tions and fluctuations partook greatly of yes
terday's sensational developments, there was a
quick return to normal conditions In nearly all
respects. The pronounced strength of this mar
ket last night gave European bears another
twinge of fright, which resulted In a skyrocket
rise of 12 to 13 points In Liverpool soon after the
opening. New Tork shorts also m*de a wild
drive for safer ground on the opening here, but
before their demands could be appeased prices
climbed 9 to 15 points. There came a smash of
16 to 20 points under a dash of the public for
: the profits which had accrued during the late
bulge. With the collapse came the passing off
of the bull fever and a return of careful trad-
Ing. Thereafter changes were comparatively
Â¦ narrow and speculation failed to reach anything
like the volume recorded yesterday. The gallery
was packed with expectant onlookers before the
opening and the pit below was the object of
special Interest to visitors. Reports that Euro
pean shorts had effected a long sought for set
tlement took the snap out of the bull trading In
Liverpool as well as here. The claim was also
made that the damage to cotton in Galveston
had been exaggerated.

PUGILISM IN
NEW YORK HAS
BEEN KILLED
Says the Charges Made by Mrs. Selby
and Mrs. Corbett Have J>e
stroyed Confidence
Manager of Twentieth Cen
tury Club So Expresses
Himself.
No one in New York is more distressed
than James Kennedy, manager of
the Twentlch Century Athletic Club.
He announces his belief that the
fight was honestly conducted and
adds that if there were any pre
arrangements they were without his
knowledge. Mr. Kennedy is of opinion
that the theories that have followed the
disappearance of Corbett have made it im
possible for fighting to be resumed here.
Tom O'Rourke is thoroughly convinced
that the contest between Corbett and Mc-
Coy was dishonest, although he will not
say so for publication. To his friends
O'Rourke has not hesitated to say that
McCov Â¦was not knocked out.
"Now that remark shows conclusively
that at that time Mrs. Corbett knew of no
deal for McCoy to lose. She thought that
fight was to be on its merits and in her
anger at her husband she hoped he would
be defeated. I have known Corbett and
his wife for many years and I know he
has been at all times infatuated with her.
The only reason he went to Europe was
that he thought it best they should separ
ate."
John Considine, Corbett's business part
ner and manager, was greatly disturbed
by the charges of fraud made by Mrs.
Corbett and Mrs. Selby. "Corbett," said
Considine. "had a conference with his wife
just before he started for Madison Square
Garden for his contest with McCoy. They
quarreled and the woman's last words to
her husband were:
X 'Jim. I hope McCoy will knock your
head off to-night.'
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â More consterna
tion and real surprise was caused to manj r
among those interested in pugilism by the
revelations in connection with the recent
Corbett-McCoy fight made by the wives
of the two pugilists. So many had con
vinced themselves that the contest was
not won and lost on its merits that the
disclosures in the affidavits made by tho
two women in their application for di
vorce were somewhat discounted, but it
had been hoped by those who have most
at stake In a financial way that the scan
dal would be hushed up. It is now admit
ted thai the course taken by Mrs. Corbett
and Mrs. Selby has done a great damage
to pugilism. Mrs. Corbett said to-day lo
a Call representative she could furnish
proof of many charges she has made
against her husband. ,
'"I can display a check that was paid,
which I drew for Jim when he wanted
$10,000 to place in Burke's hands," said
Mrs. Corbett. "That $10,000 was returned
to me after the fight. I will also show a
check for $2000 which I. drew in favor of
McVey after the Sharkey-Corbett fight.
It will be remembered McVey Jumped into
the ring and In consequence John Kelly
awarded the contest to Sharkey. McVey
was well paid for his interference, lt being
well advertised in advance how that light
was to result."

Chang, having been directed by the Em

toward a settlement of all the difficulties
with the powers, has applied through the
Chinese Embassadors at the various capi
tals for a guarantee from the powers for
a safe conduct at sra and on land on his
way to Peking for the beginning of the
negotiations. His application, it is added,
has not yet been answered.
Diplomatic circles in London are inclined
to believe that this step will lead to simi
lar action on the part of the United States
and Japan, and that while Germany may
hold cut until Field Marshal Count von
Waldersee arrives in China, she will ulti
mately acquiesce, leaving Great Britain
little choice but to follow suit.

State Department is not yet
ready to b<;rin direct negotia

question his credentials as a nler.ipoien

abeyance. Probably th;s is because ail of

his first call was in part, at least, to se

REFOSED FOR
YEARS AND OF
A PHYSICIAN
BERKELEY, Sept. 11.â Addlson Kelly,
the famous Princeton athlete who Is to
coach the University of California foot
ball squad, has arrived. There was no
student demonstration on' his arrival, as
very few knew that he waa expected.
Kelly went to the Chi Phi Fraternity
house, where he will probably remain dur
ing the football season.
"I shall not commence work with the
squad until next Saturday." said Mr. Kel
ly to-day. "I am fc-elln? in excellent
health and am ready to commence active
training."
Next week the men will * come out for
light practice. There will also bo some
preliminary gymnasium work for the
squad. Although nearly seventy-five men
have signed for football Â¦work, most o*
them are frc3hmen. Of the "30-0" eleven
but five men remain. They are Captain
Pringle, right tackle: Corniah. center;
Smith, right half; Womble and Hill. ends.
Coach' Kelly expects, however, to turn
out some good men out of the new {ma
terial.
Some of the most promising of the fresh
men are J. C. Whlpple.Jr. of Decoto. Or
val Overall of VlÂ«saUa. S. M. Stow of Oo
leta and W. C. Duff of Berkeley. Besides
these there are several upper classmen
of known ability.
Coach Kelly's appearance on the campus
Saturday will be the signal for an en
thusiastic student demonstration. Prepa
rations are already being made for that
event.

NO RELIEF FOR
TRAVELERS ON
NARROW-GAUGE
emerged from this stage of develoDment We
are no lontrer patipfied -merely to support kln
uenrnrtenF. They must be of a uniformly high
standard and in the hands of professionally
trained klnderfrnrtnen". To accomplish this
there wan needed a central body to determine
the standard and to secure means for support
ing the work.
1'ntll thlx pnrlnir each school was absolutely
dfRtinct from every other, hut a growing sense'
of the need of co-operation led to a spontane
ous effort for federation. The standard estab
lifhod by the federation requires tho schools be
non-*ectaiian. that the lclnderjrartners in charge
snail hold recog-ntzed credentials and that the
salaries pnld be not less than $40 a month.
At present each board still attends to Its own
finances, but It is our aim to place thÂ» col
lection and distribution of funds In the hands
of the central hoard. In order to be of proper
value to the community the kindergartens must
be tnken from the charity haBls, where they
are supported by private subscription, and made
part of the public school system, supported by
public taxes. This has been successfully done
in Santa Harbara and Los Anjrelea. It Is easy
to predict that parents In large communities
will soon demand kindergarten privileges for all
children from 4 to 6 years old. It will then be
ne<vÂ»Â«<!Â»ary for the city officials to know what
constitutes kindergarten training. When that
time comes it will be found that the Associa
tion of Kindergartens has done much to pre
pare the way for the change.
The officers of the Associated Kinder
gartens of Oakland are as follows:
President, Mrs. F. M. Smith; first vice presl-
So the people of Alameda will have to
get along for many months with the best
the railroad is willing to give them.
"No. this Is not the three-train arrange
ment we talked of giving to our narrow
pat:ge patrons. The chances are that, we
will hot be able to make the change now
until after the first of the year. The
whole narrow-gauge system Is being
worked to Its fullest capacity and we can
not spare anything for the local. What
engines are not in the repair shop are
pulling long freight trains in the moun
tains and we do not expect any let-up
until toward the close of the year."
Superintendent Frazier's order was to
have gone into effect on August 15. When
the l.'ith came around the trains continued
to run in the old haphazard fashion. It
was given out as an excuse that most of
the engines were in the repair shop, but
that tho change would be made Septem
ber 1. September 1 has come and gone
and the people are still waiting.
The most the railroad has done is to put
a third engine on at the High-street ter
minus to relieve somewhat the congested
holiday traffic, but it has not served to
mend matters much. From the continual
use made of the cars, lasting from 5:45
a. m. to 3 a. m.. the last three days they
have become almost unfit for occupancy.
They reek with foul air, expectoration
and "tobacco smoke. They have not been
swept and Â«the windows are blurred.
To ascertain if the third engine at High
street was the three-train arrangement
promised by the railroad to the people a
Cail reporter questioned an official this
afternoon on the subject. The railroad
man said:
ALAMEDA, Sept. 11.â Patrons of the
Southern Pacific's' narrow-gauge local
trains cannot hope for relief from the long
delays and unsanitary cars, due to the
inadequate equipment for handling large
travel, for months to come. September 1
was the date pet by the Southern Pacific
for the Inauguration of a three-train ar
rangement for the line like that on the
Oakland narrow gauge local. The hopes
of the people were raised to a high pitch
by the official document ordering the
charge which was posted at the mole.
The people had visions of trains that
pulled out on time and cars that contained
air fit to breathe. But tho Southern Pa
cific's promises are not to be kept and
tho hopes cf its patrons go glimmerine.
The promise to give the people an Im
proved service was* only wrung out of the
railroad after a petition sij?ue<i by hun
dreds of tlum wus presented at head
quarters. The petition was the result of
a series of exasperating delays and acci
dents which were suffered by the com
muters. In the petition the petitioners
prayed for a change to a broad-gauge
system, but were willing to tiike the next
best thing, a three-train arrangement, if
the other could not be given.
About the 1st of August a notice signed
by Superintendent Prazier was posted up
at the mole ordering the three-truin ar
rangement. The order simply meant that
three trains were to do the work now
performed by two, the extra train to be
always at the mole, made up and ready
to pull out as soon as passengers were on
lKtanl. This arrangement was expected
to regulate the sanitary condition of the
cars, so much complained of by the Board
of Health, as It would permit them to be
thrown open and windswept while being
switched at the mole.
FUNERAL OF THE LATE
HENRY A. CHITTENDEN
OAKLAND. Sept. 11.â The funeral of
the late Henry- A. Chlttenden was held
this afternoon from the family residence,
1529 Spring street, Berkeley. The services

Church, and William Nat Friend of tho

ducted the exercises. .The City Council
of Oakland sent a floral "Gates Ajar" In
token of Mr. Chlttenden'S; services to the

moment later she ran down, screaming
that a man was standing in the doorway,
and fell in a Ot of hysterics.
JCo description could be obtained of the

WORK RESUMED AT THE

OAKLiAND, Sept. 11.â The men who
struck at the rolling mills of the Judson
Iron Works !n anticipation of a cut in
wages, 'returned to work this mornins
after having- been out but two working
days. The original scale of wages is be
ing paid and the full force of men have
been rc-employcd.
Much satisfaction is expressed at Emery
ville over -the* speedy settlement of tho
trouble. It is said that owing to the fall
in the price of iron the men will make no
demand for an Increase in pay and that
no further dissatisfaction is anticipated.
OAKLAND, Sept. 11.â Through tho
efforts of a number of prominent
society ladles of Oakland, inter
ested In educational and philan
thropic work, the various kindergartens
of this city have been united into a single
federation under the name of "The As
sociated Kindergartens of Oakland. th.>
chief object being tho. formation of a sys
tem of kindergartens which will be
merged Into the public school system of
Cakland.
The efforts of the ladies have already
met with such success that Instruction
of a uniform character is now given at all
the local kindergartens, ami applicants
for teaehere' positions must give evidence
of unusually thorough training.
The first report of the Associated Kin
dergartens, which has just been issued,
covering the work since the birth of the
association, shows 165 regular members,
nearly 200 subscribers and an enrollment
of 4G1 pupils, apportioned among the
Fchools as follows: Central. 72; Good

Tho Democracy of Alameda county is
In sore straits. While its county conven

Hut the gentlemen who named the
ticket did not realize how hopeless was
the situation. To be sure, they put up
Thomas Scott of Livermore for Superior
Judge, against the protest of his friends

laughed that off. saying-, "Oh, Tom's i
good fellow, and he will stay on the
ticket."
But Tom did not stay. He has positively
and emphatically declared that he will

DEMOCRATS DROP

PARTY NOMINEES
and for years the museums of Europ#
have been In the market with ample funds
for their purchase, so it was tf> them own
ers came with their treasures and they
almost invariably found purchasers. Not
withstanding all these drawbacks and dif
ficulties we have accomplished wonders.
By reason of the size and wealth of tho
city it is but natural that the largest and
most Important art museum of tho coun
try should be located in New York. It 13
scarcely credible aa one contemplates thvs
structure wherein are housed the treas
ures of the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in Central Park, with Its imposing addi
tion now in process of erection, and the
still more Imposing contents of the build
ing, that thirty years ago the metropolis
was without any such public collection.
There was It is true, a modest lot of pic
tures at the New York Historical 3oclety,
but a gallery In the real sense of the wnra
there was none. Now. in addition, wo
have the Lenox IJhrary collection and
that at the Brooklyn institute of Aru
and Sciences. When. hr.wÂ«ver. In !S70, .*
small band of public spirited gentlemen
came together to form an organization
that should fill this want the average
American notion of the fine arts was hazy*
and vague. Six years later at Philadel
phia the Centennial exhibition may bs
said to have caused a veritable awaken
ing, the contributions from the various
foreign countries giving to the untravele-l
American nn abiding sense of what was
being done in modern art.
Instantly the effect was felt. Nothing
before or since has done so much to stim
ulate a taste and an appreciation for art
in America. The building up of the Met
ropolitan Museum wn*. however, not un
attended with difficulties. Though others
have worked hard and given time ana
money for Its advancement, credit for its
final accomplishment Is due In a great
measure to the unselfish efforts of Henry
Q. Marquand and the late John Taylor
Johnson. Mr. Johnson was the first presi
dent of the museum, and Mr. Marquand,
who succeeded him, still retains the of
flce.
Th<Â» valti*Â» of Mr. Marquand'n Rifts totha
museum exceeds the million-dollar mark
and, what Is quite as much to the purpose,
their selection has been made -with rarÂ»
discrimination and unfailing Judgment of
the needs of the institutionâ two qualities,
by the way, that have materally helped to
crive to the museum the high standard
which It enjoys to-day. The Metropolitan
Museum contains a remarkable collection
of the art of all nations, particularly that
of modern Franc, the Luxembourg alono
surpassing It. This, of course. Is duo
to the fact that fr>r many years thÂ« Amer
ican collector has been attracted by thÂ«Â»
art of the Gaul, buying liberally of hl3
productions, while the dealer, always with
a keen scent for lucrative business, has
rjurinp three decades past been a liberal
importer of the Frenchman's canvases.
Thus, through bequestg and purchase, tho
museum has come Into possession of a
great exhibit of modern French art.
To mention a few of the more important
pictures will g!ve an idea of the extent
and significance of this school. The great
Melssonier. master of all the technical
possibilities of painting, one of thÂ« great
authorities on composition, on mll.tnry
art and on costume and accessories, has
here his chef-d'oeuvre, called "Frlcdlartd.
1W." which shows a passage of mounted
soldiers galloping across a field In review
before Napoleon I. Probably no more re
markable technical achievement waa ever
secured. The picture was painted for the
late A. T. Stewart, the merchant prince,
and cost him $i>0.000 when It was com-'
pleted in 1S7<5. a remarkable price, al
though to-day the canvas. werÂ» It placed
at auction, would bring far more. Ileri
is the famous "Joan of Arc." by the brill
iant Jules Ba-stlen-Lepage. a work which
had a profound effect on the younger
painters of all nations and brought out
many lmltatora. At the salon In Paris,
where it was first shown. It created a gen
uine sensation, and to-day It holda Its own
as a remarkable, able, sincere piece of
work of the first rank.

of New York will be continued on

fA/TlOL/S ART GALLERIES OF THE U/ORLD.
It was as far back as 1S05 that seventy
one art-loving citizens of Pennsylvania
met under the sacred roof of Indepen
dence Hall, in the quiet city of Philadel
phia, an.1 then and there solemnly and in
true American fashion "resolved" that
an association be formed "to promote the
cultivation of the fine arts in the United
States of America by introducing; correct
and elegant copies from the works of the
first masters in sculpture and painting,
and by thus facilitating the access to such
standards, and also by occasionally con
ferring moderate but honorable premiums
and otherwise assisting the studies and
exciting the efforts of the artists, gradu
ally to unfold, enlighten and invigorate
the talents of our countrymen. From
this beginning subsequently came the
first public art collection In America ami
the inauguration of the Pennsylvania
Academy of Fine Arts.
We have In America, to-day a few really
important art museums in the larger
Cities and a large number of promising
institutions in the smaller towns, and
while we are behind the cities of Europe,
it will be remembered we have had the
collecting habit for comparatively few
vears and we have no national funds,
with a National Art Commission, to
purchase works for distribution anvinff
the museums of the country, as in France
and elsewhere. Up to the present this
condition has not been altogether an un
mixed evil. We have seen in some of
the hopelessly mediocre work, commis
sioned for the legislative halls of the na
tion, the possibilities of national art
committees, and on the whole we may be
thankful that more canvases and statues
of the kind have not been bought and
sent by Government authority to
museums throughout the land. The
American museum has enough to strug
gle with as it is and too frequently is
compelled to accept wretched work as
the condition on which otherwise valuable
legacies are bequeathed.
It frequently happens that the rich
merchant, dying, dfplres to have his nanrÂ»
perpetuated as a patron of art. and he
sends the contents of his gallery to the
art museum of his city, perhaps accom
panied with many thousands of dollars
for Its maintenance and increase, upon
the condition that It be kept Intact and
always shown under his name. This Is
one of the greatest trials the trustees of
our museums are called upon to undergo,
although in most of the leading institu
tions the rules are now Inexorable as to
the admission of poor Â¦work. Collectors
of spurious old masters and early Amer
ican sculpture are among the worst of
fenders in this direction and they give
trustees many unhappy hours by their
mistaken if kindly attentions of a pub
lic nature. Another fact militates
against the standards of the work of the
older masters. Fine canvases of the
ancient princes of art are not only rare,
but now sell at prices almost prohibitive.
With Its wide expanse of territory. Its
many important cities and consequent
different centers of interest. America's art
possessions are greatly scattered, and
any complete account of them would be
not only difficult but unduly expansive.
New York, Chicago, Boston. Washington,
Philadelphia, all have their museums. In
stitutes or academies, not to mention In
numerable smaller cities with less impor
tant collections. Merely to enumerate
their possessions would be out of thÂ©
question. Aa with most things In this
country, art projects were pushed through
with astonishing rapidity and true, Amer
ican . energy. Where European nations
would have taken a century, here a dec
ade sufficed in j which to establish splen
did palaces of art. while the liberality, and
public spirit of the citizen furnished that
necessary material adjunct, the financial
backing. If the quality of the art pur
chases, however, has not always kept
pace with the generosity of the donations,
we are a young people and have much to
learn.

The Board of Health of this city has
under serious consideration the adoption
of rules officially stamping tuberculosis,
commonly known as consumption, as a
contagious disease, the presence of which
shall force a quarantine upon the place
occupied by the patient. This drastic
measure is recommended by Dr. J. H.
Todd in his annual report as health offi
cer, which has been Jlled with the City
â¢Council.
Health Officer Todd lays. stress upon the
rule proposed by the Hoard of Health
which was to exclude from the public
schools all teachers and pupils who should
be afflicted with the disex.se. The school
directors rejected .portions of the resolu
tion which the health ofllciais deemed
were most vital.
Commenting upon thl? action. Dr. Todd
said: "Had the entire rule been adopted,
in order to make It effective, the Board
of Health couJd have asked the City
Council for the paasagre of an ordinance
making tuberculosis a disease to be re
ported as contagious. This, In time, would
have furnished the location of families
where tuberculosis existed and wouid
have enabled the health department to
keep under surveillance the children of
such families as well as to force the ob
servance of such sanitary measures as
would tend to prevent the infection of
, others. We are- thankful, however, for
even a small bepnnlng and trust that the
! time Is not far distant when the public
will no more willingly tolerate tuberculo
sis than they now do smallpox or bubonic
plaRue."
Referring to the condition of public
buildings, thÂ© report declares that the
plumbing 1 of the county Jail Is bad. The
city prison is denounced as most unsan
itary. Dr. Todd said: "This Is not on ac
count of negligence of those In charge,
but on account of Us location In the cellar
i of the City Hall, where the conditions
requisite to sanitation, namely, ventila
tion and sunlight, are not obtainable. Un
til a new prison Is built these conditions
cannot be changed and the unfortunate
inmates must continue to suffer not only
the penalty of the law, but n deterioration
of health as well. The greatest want of
the prison Is a ward where wounds may
bo dressed and the sick cared for In a hu-

AmcTip the speakers who were In favor

h<Â»lp support the Government
phonic! help elect those who
administer It, that she is poInR to
apply to the courts, unless the
County Clerk consents to register
her to-morrow morning.
To-day Mrs. Thompson appeared
at the Clerk's office and demanded
of Deputy Charles Arnold that he
place her name on the preat regis
ter. When the surprised custodian
of the voters' roll demurred, he en
countered several well-delivered ar
guments which had their origin In
the arsenal presided over by Susan
B. Anthony and Frances Wllliard.
Parrying the thrusts as best he
could. Deputy Arnold told his call
er that he could register no one on
a holiday. So Mrs. Thompson will
call again to-morrow.

POSTUM CEKEAL.
FLY TO PIECES.
The Effect of Coffee on Highly Or-
ganized People.
"I hsvf be?n a coffee user for years,
and about two years ago got into a
very serious condition of dyspepsia and
indigestion. It stenied to me I would
fly to pieces. I was so nervous that at
the least noi^e I was distressed, and
many times could not straighten myself
up because of pain.
"My physician told me I must not eat
any heavy or strong food and ordered a
diet, pivinj; me some medicine. I fol-
lowed directions carefully, but kept on
usinf? coffee and did not get any better.
.Last winter husband, who was away
on business, had Postum Food Coffee
served to him in the family where he
boarded.
"He liked it so well that when he
came home he brought some with him.
We betjan using it and I found it most
excellent. While I drank it my stomach
never bothered me in the least, and I j?ot
over my nervous troubles. When the
Postum was all gone we returned to cof-
fee: then my stomach be^an to hurt
me as before and the nervous conditions
r ame on aerain.
"That showed me exactly what was
the cau*e of the whole trouble, so I quit
drinking coffee altogether and kept on
usins: Poftum Food Coffee. The old
troubles left again and I have never had
any trouble since." Anna Coen, Mt.
Ephraim. Ohio. j

same people remarked how white and lovely was my complexion.
I (eel that I cannot do without it I send you amount for two more boxes- Do you have any

The 2:05 pace had only four starters,
and Frank Bogash sold at $100 to $50 in
spite of the high reputation of the black
peldinsr Connor. This was a race which
finished In three heats, each heat being
in fact a race. Connor won the first heat
in the sensational time of 2:03H. The fin
ish in the second heat was a hair-raising
one. as Frank Bogash. Connor and Royal
R. Sheldon came down the stretch to
gether and shot under the wire so closely

them, the heat going to Sheldon. Connor
Â¦won the third heat in a whipping finish.
Summary:
The keenest race of the day waa the
2:09 pace, in which the bay gelding Harry
O was so hot a choice that he sold a
strong favorite over a splendid field of
seven. Ho won the first and second heats
in close and whipping finishes. Fanny
Dillard then flashed to the front with a
couple. The fifth heat looked as If It
would decide the race, as Harry O ap
peared to bo winning in the stretch, but
in a cracking finish Will Leyburn won
by half a length. In the sixth heat Fanny
Dillard led a tired party home In 2:03 by
a length.

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 11â Of all the
original forty-five eltgibles to the rich Fu
turity running stake for 2-year-olds,
valued at nearly 52720,' that came up for
decision at the track to-day only a meager
bunch of five answered the post call. In
a one-sided contest St. Rica, the St. An
drew-Ricardo gelding, trained by Tommy
Lottridge and sporting the Alameda sta
ble's pink with purple polka-dots, won at
mellow odds. Dunfree was coupled In the
betting with Spain War, the two opening
2 to 5 choices, receding later on to 4 to 5,
when a stubborn assault on the ring 1 ran
down the price against St. Rica from 3
to 8 to 5. At the post Henry Shields on j
Dunfree and Farrell astride Lily Andrew I
gave a free exhibition of Idiotic horse
manship in an endeavor to beat the flag,
delaying the start nearly half an hour.
Reagan finally sent them away, well
aligned, Lily Digps first by the post. Dun
free a moment later picked up the run
ning. At the far turn Ruiz on St. Rica
passed the leader as if he had been pick
eted and the run was over. Ruiz eased
the youngster up to 1:16. Spain War sot
: up In time to secure the show," a couple
of lengths behind Lily Andrew.
With typical rainy weather and a fast
track favorites met with varying fortunes,
two out of four returning with the coin.
The attendance was again large, the
books doing a land office business.

CHARLES KOENIG
SHOOTS HIMSELF
f\ N inordinate Indulgence In alcoholic
II drinks, 'with the resulting depression
w^\ of spirits and despondency equiva-
J v lent 'jo Insanity, caused Charles
Koenig to take his life early yester
day morning.
Koenlg lived with his wife and family
at the southeast corner of Union and
Lyon streets. He was an expert cement
worker, but by reason of his intemperate
habits was often out of work. When
winding up a spree he usually became de
spondent and talked of suicide. On two
occasions during the present year he at
tempted to kill himself, but was discov
ered by. his family in time to prevent him
harming himself. Yesterday morning when
his wife arose to prepare the breakfast
he got out of bed, took a revolver out of
the bureau drawer, placed the muzzle In
his mouth and shot himself 'through; the
brain. He was a native of Germany, 52
years old.
DAVID HAMILTON, a retired rail
way conductor 61 years old. was
found yesterday morning asphyx
iated In his bed at 618 Steiner street.
The key of the gas burner tt3.s
turned, allowing the gas to flow, but the
occupants of the house said that they
saw no reason why the case should be
thought a suicide, and expressed their
belief that Hamilton's death was due to
an accident. He was not at all despon
dent, they said, nnd they had observed
no signs of Insanity.
Mr. Hamilton was a widower and hnd
been residing with Mr. and Mrs. A. IT.
Schneider, the lady being his, sister. At
Â¦*Â¦ o'clock yenterciay morning they detected
the odor of illuminating gas and traced
it to hi* room. They found him uncon
scious and called in a doctor who lived
near by. but all attempts at resuscitation
were In vain.
â¢ The jras burner waa provided with a
patent lighter, which was loose, and -when
turned off allowed the gas to escape.

Detectives have been for some time en
gaged by the British Columbia Govern

rest of Japanese for securing fraudulent
naturalization papers. The detective*
found the job a difficult one. for as soon

are even now sending them over . the
American line at the rate of 100 a day. A

through him Japanese were arrested with
the bogus naturalization papers on them.
The Government has a cleas case with
the Japanese arrested and will hold %i

alarming infraction of naturalization
laws. In the meantime Seattle and other

ATTORNEY PROSTRATED
BY HEART FAILURE
THE most interesting event In the lo
cal art world this week, though per
haps from an historical rather than
from an artistic standpoint. Is the
loan exhibition of subjects of old
California at the Mark Hopkins Institute
of Art.
On Monday the gallery was thrown
open to visitors and a large crowd assem
bled to enjoy the artistic hospitality of
the house and the noteworthy collection
that had been gathered together.
The collection numbers about forty ex
amples, including specimens of the work
of Errest Narjot. Charles Nahl. Carlos J.
HItteil. Coutant. J. B. Wandesforde . Je
wett. W. Shaw. A. L. Pocson. George Bur
goss. Emma F. Van Winkle and that
ouaint old painter. Mrs. Orianna Day.
There is also a large proportion of un
signed pictures, of insufllclent artistic in
terest, however, to arouse the connois
seurs' curlositv on that score. An ex
planatory catalogue is a welcome^ adjunct
to the exhibition and will be an interest
ing souvenir In days to come of the semi
centennial anniversary of Admission day,
September. 1900.
Among the pictures possessing the
strongest local and historic interest is a
large panorama. "San Francisco. July.
1S49." painted by George H. Burgess, and
attested by a formidable roll of witnesses
as a strictly accurate representation of
the town as it was at that time. Tele
graph Hill stands bare from top to bot
tom, with a lone trail from Montgomery
street straggling to its summit; Russian
Hill lifts bleakly in the distance and all
the history of the tangible change of fifty
years is here illustrated. The chief sur
nrise the picture holds for the uninitiated,
however, is, its testimony to the crowded
state of the town In 1S40 and its advanced
architectural conditions.
The naive old portraits by Mrs. Orianna
Day of General M. G. Vallejo, command-
Ing general of California from 1837 to 1848,
are certainly worthv of place In a Cali
fornia gallery, and Nahl's "Mexican Fan
dango" possesses both historic and
artistic interest. The same may be said
of the Narjot collection of Indian. Span
ish and Mexican subjects and a number
of quaint old portraits and fast-disappear
ing landmarks are worthy the attention
of the antiquarian.
The exhibition altogether Is most sug
gestive. One thing among others that
inevitably suggests Itself is the value of
that kind of art which concerns itself
with contemporary life, the "to-day" of
Its existence, the scenes by which It Is
surrounded. Another thought. Indeed, is
that California has added a quite reason
able quota to the. artistic sum- total of the
nation, in consideration of her short
length of existence, though the Io>\n part
of the Hopkins collection hardly sup
ports that latter theory. And it is a
strange thing to stand upon the artistic
threshold of a people's future for whom
so much mav. with coolest reason, be
prophesied. Temperament is here, new
blood is here and race intermixture of
most problematic result: there are plc
turea at every turn, a climate which per
mits outdoor painting almost all the
year round and a perfect freedom from
trammeling traditions of older schools and
methods. Opinion is divided as to whether
there exists here any art public for the
encouragement of the native artist, but
he that as it mav. if to his natural ad
vantages the native Californlan adds the
serious devotion and worshipful effort
that must be his who would worthily
serve his capricious mistress, then the
centennial onnivr rsary "loan exhibition of
local work." will be something worth
while waiting the fifty years to see.

Board of Trade Thanks Professor
Wyley for Efforts on Behalf of
an American Industry.
The State Board of Trade met yester
day. A letter from the El Paso Chamber
of Commerce to the Governor of Texa?
protesting against the further continu
ance of the oppressive and unjust quaran
tine now in force against San Francisco
was read. The following resolution was
adopted:
RÂ»*olved. That the Ptat<fc Ronrd of Tra'lf

th<? rhnnil>^r of Commerce of Kl Paso, Texas,
in requpstinp that the quarantine aeainFt ni

branl that no necessity for quarantine ever
existed, nnd certainly there is no grounds for
its prnlnniratinn at this dfÂ»t<*.

transmitted by the secretary of the State RiaH
of TrÂ»Â«1e to the Chamber of Commerce at El

end should he appear in the ring to-night
the reason of It will be to save his for

I The National Club, fearing that Ryan
Ioub not to fight Moffatt this evening. His
reluctance was expressed yesterday in
positive terms and by his earnest en
deavors to force a promise from the
stakeholder that the forfeit money would
not be claimed In the advent of his In
ability to appear In the ring. Ryan post
ed 5250 as a weight forfoit and ?2T>0 Tor ap-
would not fight, entered into a $1000 con
tract yesterday with Al Nelll. By Its
terms Nelll agrees to be at the ringside
this evening, ready to fight either Moffatt
or Ryan. There was* some caviling over
the amount, but Nelll finally won out
and an even $1000 was guaranteed him. It
seems that the National Club was most
particular over the "either" party In the
contract. According to the terms of the
original agreement between Moffatt and
Ryan the former signed to appear at 158
or under. During the last few days it is
said Moffatt has been piling on weight
so fast and furiously that he might not
be able to reach the maximum allowed.
Fearing that Ryan would make strenuous
objection to overweight on the part of
Moffatt. the Xational Club, both eyes fas
tened on all contingent possibilities,
agreed with Neill to meet either Ryan or
Moffatt. Â¦â¢Â¦â¢--.. .
That Tommy Ryan has been sick Is an
assured fact. He has been left much
weakened by his illness and would rather
not-fisht. The forfeit money Is the thing
which brought' him downtown yesterday.
He is making a strong fight to save that.
Many were the consultations held by all
concerned yesterday morning, noon and
night.
: Ryan floes not say positively that he
will light. He pimply gives out for the
press and public the announcement to the
managers of the National Club that he
will appear according to schedule. All
who have been In Immediate and confiden
tial communication with him during the
last few days say that Ryan was se
riously 111 and suffered a physical weak
ening on account of his Illness.
