Generals, soldiers and correspondents
scrambled upr the banks through Â¦ filth,

rounded the rescuers ami shook the hands

citedly along into . the legation grounds,
where the colors were planted. The sol

the salvation of. the besieged. The Min
isters and officers j demanded - the latest

An hour afterward General Chaffee;

Back of the United States legation Is a
work named "Fort Myers," which the
marines held, completely screening both
sides of the walls, with steps leading to it.
There Is a loophole In the barrier across
the wall,* which faces a similar Chinese
work: a few yards away. Another wall
bars Legation street In front of the Ger
man legation, and confronting the en
emy's barricades within those limits are
yet more walls, enabling the foreigners
to contract the area of defense If pressed.
The tops of the American and British
buildings; were badly torn by the Chinese
shells. The rate of the foreign shells that
fell during the first three weeks of the
bombardment was 4CO a dny.' Bucketfuls
of bullets were gathered In the; grounds!
Four hundred and fourteen people lived
In the compound through the greater, part
of the siege. .Three hundred and four
marines, assisted by sixty-five, volunteers,
commanded by the English captain, Poole,
defended the place. Eleven^ civilians were
killed and fourteen wounded. ' Fifty-four
marines and sailors were killed and 112
wounded. .
Gilbert Reid, who was wounded In the

DETAILS OF SUFFERINGS OF
THE PEKING LEG ATIONERS
PEKING. Aug. 14 (by post via
Tientsin).â A medal will be struck
off commemorating the siege of
Peking. It will bear the legend,
"Men. Not Walls. Make a City."
In the grounds of the British
les-ation. where a handful of men with
stood the millions of the Chinese capital
for fifty-six days, a memorable celebra
tion is in progress to-niKht in vindication
of that principle. Missionaries, assembled
about Bell Tower, are singing the Dox
ology. Rockets are blazing. Soldiers and
civilians of all nationalities are fraterniz
ing. The women are applauding the sound
of the cannon that are smashing tho yel
low roofs of the Forbidden City. The
tired Sikhs are planting their tents ,bn
tlie lawn and the American and Russian
contingents are lighting campfires along
the stretch of turf extending beyond the
1 Tartar wall.
Through the ruins of the foreign set
tlement an eager cosmopolitan crowd Is
Jostlingâ Indians, Cossacks, legation
ladies, diplomats, Americans from the
Philippines and French disciplinarians
from Saigon, who kept discreetly to the
rear while the fighting was in progress,
but came conspicuously to the front when
looting began. Only the Japanese, who
have earned the first place, .are absent.
Resident foreigners welcome the luxury
of walking about and Immunity from bul
lets. The newcomers are anxious to In
spect the evidences of an historic defense.
These barricades are, after all, the moat
wonderful sight in Peking. The barriers
hedging the British legation are a marvel
of stone and brick walls and earthworks.

The following named died during the
the Japanese troops and our force. Our
experience was to meet an enfilading flre
from a considerable section of the walled
city and from the mud village, which
might be called a suburb of the city
proper.
"Colonel Liscum lost his life thro"ugh a
combination of bravery- and recklessness.
He led us In the assault on the village
and died a soldier's death almost instant
ly. Poor fellow, he exposed himself un
necessarily. We were going asalnst an
enemy that could not be seen. The houses
were of mud and they had been loopholed.
so that when the advance was made not a
Chinaman could be seen. The flre of the
enemy was quite accurate and our losses
were heavy. However, we went as far a*,
we could and then held our position
through the day. We also succeeded In
quieting the yellow men on our front after
some exceedingly warm work.
"Early in the advance they hit mo
twice, once In the right hip and once In
the left leg. This was when we had got
within 150 yards of the village. It wa*
Impossible to drive the Chinese out on
account of a river which we could not
cross In the face of the fierce flre. Our
losses, which, as I said before, were very
heavy. occurred while we were crossing
the field which the Chinese were in a po
sition to sweep from their intrenchments.
In fact they had us at their mercy prac
tically during the entire day, but the boys
of the Ninth held every inch of the ap
parently untenable ground they had
gained until darkness fell and they were
ordered to fall back.- I went Into the
hands of the surgeons after being in the
field all day and did not see the final as
sault on the following day in which the
walls were carried and the allies gained
the victory.
"As to the fighting qualities of the Cni
nese, I will say that 30 long as they can
fight behind fortifications or breastworks
they do well and the trained soldiers shoot
quite accurately, but you put them in thÂ»
open to contend with American troop3
and the Yankees can walk over them at
odds of five to one. They have not that
necessary quality of the soldier known as
heart. Captain Noyes, who lasted longer
in the fight than I did. can give you a
better idea of the day than I can."
Gained Ground by Fierce Volleys.
"I was hit just before the last advance,
said Captain Charles R. Noyea, adjutant
of the Ninth Regiment. "We were under
a very heavy fii;e and gained our ground
by fierce volleys and rushes made while
the enemy was gathering for the return
fire. Our men would I not ! budge anii
stayed under flre from the early morning
dawn till dark before retiring. I, got a
scratch on the arm about 3:30 a. m.. In the
first advance, before wt got Inside the
mud wall.' About 8:30 they found me In
the calf of the left \Â°g and gave me a
wound that put : me out of action. After
I was hit I went back nfcout sixty yards
behind a house, where there were a num
ber of other, wounded men. Finally, after
great effort, I crawled through ditches In
the field until I got out of range of the

Sergeant Dorey's Story.
Sergeant Dorey of Company C of the
Ninth tells an interesting story. This
gallant fighter now occupies a cot at the
general hospital. He is crippled for life,
having lost his left arm In the Tientsin
battle. His story of the battle Is as fol-
"We started about 3 o'clock in the
morning and by daybreak had marched
four miles and taken the outer wall. The
Japs blew up the gate and planted their
guns on the wall and kept up a continu
ous flre, which enabted us to advance to
within about 300 yards or the inner wall,
a mile from the first one. We finally
reached the trenches, but not before most
of us had been wounded and five had
been killed. We got Into the trenches anrt
fought for all we were worth, but with
the knowledge that every shot must count
as ammunition was running short. ThÂ»
Chinese had guns at the "ends of th*Â»
trenches, with which they poured in a
raking fire. We were up to our waisia
In water and had to stoop to keep from
being hit. The sight of a head poking
up called forth a shower of bullets In it.-.
direction and these Chinamen are all good
marksmen. I was shot In the arm about
II a. in. and had to stick it out ail day,
as to move out of cover meant certaiii
death. Colonel Liscum was the bravÂ«?3t
of the brave. He led his men right
through the thickest shower of lead I
have ever been in, and when we saw him
drop we felt we could stay where we
were forever if we could but get a chance
to avenge his death. I think we did, but
it cost us a number of brave lives.
The Japs are great fighters and will
give up their last crust or drop of water
to an American." - Â¦
Four Wounds Could Not Stop Him.
Private von Schlick has been recom
mended for a medal of honor. He was
wounded four times and still carries a
bullet in his neck. He was ordered to
stay by a wounded comrade and place
him In a protected Dlace. He carried his
comrade 400 yards on his back and re
ceived a bullet in his shoulder Just be
fore reaching the supposed place of
safety. While bandaging his wound he
was struck In the jaw by another Chinese
bullet. Caring for himself as best ne
could he proceeded to bandage the
wounds of his comrade. Hardly had he
finished the operation when he was struck
again, this time a few Inches below the
first wound received. His officers wit
nessed his splendid behavior and will see
that he Is properly honored.
Sergeant Blckhort is another one of Co
lumbla's brave soldiers who is now occu*
pying a cot in the hospital. He is suffer
ing from a shot through the lungs. The
serseant. though scarcely able to talk,
said yesterday:
"It vas the hottest fight I have ever
been in and I saw a number of good hot
battles In Cuba and ?he Philippines. To
my Idea Colonel Ltscum was the bravest
man In China. He led his men until he
fell and asked them to do nothing he
would not do himself. Lieutenant Law
ton performed one of the greatest feats of
daring ever witnessed. He went twice
across the field we had Just won and.
though severely wounded, carried two
heavy boxes of ammunition, of which the
boys on the .firing line were very much In
need. We were at all times under a crosa
tire and could not more for fear of being
hit. "We had to stay where we were and
after lying In dirty water all day sneak
out of danger when darkness came on."

wounded- men from the bat
tlefields of China arrived on
the transport Thomas . late
Wednesday night. All of them
bear the marks of their en
counter with the Boxers and
not a few are still in a precarious con- I
dition.
The transport was given pratique early
yesterday morning and at once moved
down to the Presidio. There the wounded
and sick soldiers were landed and later
the Thomas was docked at Folsom-street
wharf.
: At Nagasaki the hospital ship Solace
and the Thomas met. The former had
aboard a number of the officers and men
from the Ninth Infantry. All of them
were with Colonel Liscum In the famous
fight before Tientsin and all of them were
wounded in that terrible encounter.
When the Thomas left Nagasaki there
were thirty-one prisoners aboard, but ten
of them escaped at Nagasaki and the
chances are some of them will come along
on the next transports under arrest.
The Thomas brought from Nagasaki 47
gallant American soldiers bearing witness
in the shape of scars and wounds of the
fierceness of the engagement of July 13
between the allied forces and Ihe Chinese.

American Troops' Awful Experience.
: From 3 a. rn. until dark -the American
soldiers marched and fought over the rice
i HeldH and through trenches Â¦ containing
water that reached tneir waists. From
the outer wall, which had been demol
ished by the British artillery, to the inner
w;*n. a distance of about a mile, the
troops forced their way through a per
fect hail of bullets: Despite the hard
ships, the sight of failing comrades and
the knowledge that the yellow devils far
outnumbered them, the gallant fellows
kept on. Fired .on from- all sides, they
never halted "until they reached the un
fordable Peiho River. They stood in the
trenches and returned bullet for bullet.

No Bullets Here, Said Brave Liscum.

FITZSIMMONS' IMPRESSIONS.
Corbett's seconds were George F. Con-
Fidine. Spider Kelly, Leo Pardello and
Fred Stone.
McCoy's handlers were his brother
JJemer Sc-lby. Harry Harris. Jack O'Brien
of Philadelphia and Bobby Burns.
The men battled for CO per cent of the
gross receipts, which was to be divided.
.5 per cent to the winner and 25 per cent
to the loser. It Is estimated that there
was about $o0.0(W in the house, so that
Corbett will receive in the neighborhood
of $18,000 and McCoy about $6000.
The betting just before the men entered
the ring was 2 to 1 on Corbett.
' Neither man when he returned to his
. dressing room showed any marks on face
- or body. Corbett. of course, was in the
1*e*t of humor and his friends were ply-
Ing him with questions or shouting con
gratulations.
Neither Man Marked.
McCoy mw that he was no longer able
to ward off the biK fellow's blows and he
threw his arms across his face, holding
his head down in hopes of paving himself
from a knockout punch. Corbett relent
lessly showered lefts and right*, which
etraigTstene<i McCoy up. and then Jim
ewung a left which crashed into McCoy's
Â¦body. McCoy doubled up. and in doing sÂ»o
held Corbett's left glove with his right
arm. Corbett then drove McCoy away
from him with a right over the heart,
end as the Kid went back staggering Jim
leaped after him. landing another left
smash on the same spot, and the Kid
dropped to the floor. McCoy bravely
tried to pet -up. but those three blows had
taken all his strength away, and while
fce made frantic endeavors to get up Ref
eree White counted off the ominous ten
seconds. By an almost superhuman ef
fort, McCoy Ptood up after he had been
counted out, but he was dazed and the
referee had to puEh.him toward his cor
ner, where his seconds took him in hand.
Inside of two minutes McCoy walked out
of the ring, closely surrounded by his
handlers. Meanwhile Corbett's friends
had jumped Into the ring and, Burround
ing the big fellow, showered congratula
tions upon him when he was announced
the winner.
The Finishing Blows.
At times f'orbett stopped his scientific
Tvnrk and resorted to slugging, which
Siroved very effective. McCoy was forced
to clinch and it was then seen that Cor
bett was surely petting the best of it.
McCoy had to break ground frequently
andT after the bell had sent them to their
corners, while both men showed signs of
fatigue M<-Coy wap certainly tno wearier.
In the fifth ah.d concluding round Corbett
forced McCoy into the former's corner,
where the Kid kept blocking and sparring
for an opening to get out. Corbett swung
lor. the head, but McCoy ducked under U
very cleverly and jumped to the center
of the ring. Jim rushed him across the
floor of the ring and by clever work
forced McCoy back into the corner again,
where he sent ripht and left to the. Kid's
head. This was the beginning of McCoy's
undoing.

yesterday. "He arrived at 9:30 a. m. Sat

Alexander McKenzie was a day laborer

On August 8 the Edith left Nome on -a
trading expedition. The persons aboard
were Morrison, Captain Gilley an<J Ed-,
ward Foregren. They intended to sail
along the Alaskan coast and trade with
the natives. The plan was to visit the
Siberian coast. An Indian named Sam.
was employed and the boat was navigated
to the Russian side, where it arrived Fri-;
day, August 1Â«>. That afternoon exchanges
were made with natives, who appeared
friendly. In the evening the traders re- "
turned aboard their vessel, which was
anchored a short distance from shore.
Morrison retired to the cabin and went,
to bed. Captain Gilley, Foregren and
Sam remained on deck. A" few minutes
later the report of a gun, discharged froja
the shore, was heard. No attention W*J
given to the incident. Presently a sec
ond shot was fired and immediately after
ward Morrison cried: "I've been shot."
Hi3 mates on the deck hurried to his as
sistance and found that a rifle bullet had
penetrated the starboard side of tho
schooner and entered " the lert groin oÂ«-
Morrison. The vessel was at once atarttu.
for American territory. At 5 o'clock thu
following morning Morrison died.
The next morning when in the vicinity
of Sledge Island Captain Gilley. while sit
ting on the rail, was struck by the boom,
and thrown into the water. His compan
ions witnessed the accident, but ho
drowned before assistance could be ren
dered. After considerable difficulty hia
body was recovered. ?Â».-Â«-,â¢.
Foregren took command and put ashore,
where he employed another Indian and
brought the Kdith into port. The disas- "
ters were reported to the authorities.
Foregren and his two native assistants '
were taken into custody.
A Russian nobleman. Count Padhorsk)-. ;
returned from Diomedes Island to Nom'o
on the steamer Albion August IS, having
rescued Count Du Pare, Oluckhardt and
Captain R. Tompkin. who had been cast
away on the island, living on seal blubber
for twenty-seven days. Padhorski about
three weeks before chartered the schooner
Frances Alice and invited the others to
accompany him on a trip of adventure
and hunting among the islands of tht*
coast of Siberia. They were to land on
the coast later on and investigate a con-
cession obtained from the Russian Gov
ernment for mining purposes. .Du Pare
and Luckhardt got off at Diomedes Island
with three days' rations, while the
schooner cruised further eastward. A .
storm blew the schooner up and down thp
coast between Cape East and Point Hope
for seventeen days. Padhorski returned
to Nome and chartered the steamer Al
bion to go to the rescue of hi3 stranded
guests.
A bold attempt at incendiarism in Nome
was made August 18. when a firebug
thought to start a general conflagration
by burning the Cabinet Saloon on Front
street. Between 12 and 1 o'clock that
morning the night watchman smeUtd'
smoke, and examination showed It
came from room 17, occupied by
an attache of ,Â»t he saloon named
Hood. The room was entered and it was
found a fire had been made of newspapers
and was burning briskly on the 'floor.- the
papers having first been saturated with
kerosene, which was also sprinkled about.
, the floor.
Under the papers a candle was burning,
the firebug having lit the candle and piled
; the papers around and over It.
The recent storms at 'Xorae caused a
terrible loss of life. So far thirty-eight
bodies have been recovered on the beach
and buried by the officials.
Captain Richardson of the Sequoia, en
gaged in the fishing trade, says seventeen,
dead bodies have been found and burled
between Topkuk and Golovin Bay and
twenty-one between Topkuk and Port "
Safetv.
R. i. Nelson found two bodies at Ciintk.
On one was found the address: 'â¢217

bodies was identified before burtel.
Reports of drowning have also >een re- ,

.VA'.writ of prohibition addressed to Judge
Noyes may be the next thing. to be sought.
There is an opÂ»n season and a "close sea-
/ E. * S. Pillsbury appeared before Judge
Morrow as â¢ attorney â¢ for P. H. Anderson.
When Judge Morrow's order was issued
Mf. j.Pillsbury saw "that it . was \ instantly
sent*, to "Nome by. three i mediums of .trans
mission that: there might be no failure to
have it reach its destination. Other at
torneys took energetic measures. .
A large array of legal talent battled
over the matter of, appeal. On the side
of the receiver were; Hubbard. Beeman &
Hume;; for the several defendants Attor
neys Charles S. Johnson, Jackson, Hatch,
Reddy, Campbell & Metson, Page, Mc-
Cutcheonand Harding & Knight strove.
Finding Judge Noyes obdurate in refus
ingto issue an order allowing an appeal,"
the contest was brought to the United
States" Circuit Court- of Appeals in this
city. The court was not in session. Judge
Morrow \ has tesued orders in the five
cases where " : Â¦ McKenzie is the receiver
which will enable trie defendants to have
their contention considered by the United,
States Circuit Court of Appeals. The
orders also restrain the receiver from in
terfering In any manner or attempting to
enforce Judge Noyes' order until the ap
peals can be heard and'determined. The
'bond was fixed by Judge Morrow at $35,000
in -each case.
Millions of dollars' worth of property
;was placed in Alexander McKenzie's
hands, as receiver, in "one day. One of
these properties has a record of yielding
$15,000 per day. The bond in each of five
receiverships' given to McKenzie was
placed by Judge Noyes at $5000. '
According to authentic advices the per
sons and companies who were operating
the mines when McKenzie was put in pos
session were greatly surprised. Nineteen
days later, as evidenced by the transcript.
Judge ' Noyes had decided that there was
no appeal from his order appointing Mc-
Kenzie : in the suit- of Robert Chipps vs.
Jafet Lunderberg, Erik O. Lindblom and
John Brynteson. He reached the same
conclusion in four Other cases, which were
as follows: 0. : Jose Comtois vs. P. H.
Anderson, Herbert H. Webster vs. Michael
J Nackkela, Olc Klemetsen and Ole K.
Hatta; : I* " F. Melsing, H. L. Blake, D. B.
Libby, W. . T. Hume and O. P. Hubbara
vs. John P. Tornases; Henry Rogers vs.
William A. Kjellman. C. D. Lane and the
Wild Goose Mining and Trading Company.
Knight was not satisfied that there was
any legitimate reason for this \unjudicial
haste, and he went, on as follows: ' -; "I
think that your Honor, will agree as to the
fact that the bill of complaint was pre
sented to your Honor on the afternoon of
the 23d day of July, and that your Honor
thereafter made an order appointing a
receiver and the papers were ' subsequent
lyâthat eveningâ handed . to the deputy
clerk of the court for filing, but that no
process was issued in the case in which I
now appear, involving claim No. 2 below,
Nos. 10 and 11 above arid No. 1 Nack
kela."
This took place August 3, eleven days
after Alexander McKenzie. the personal
friend of Judge Noyes, had by. him been
appointed receiver in five instances. No
move was made to strongly dispute
Knight's assertions. Attorney Hume,
who represented the receiver, admitted
that no summons had been placed In the
hands of an officer. He explained that
the petition for, a receiver had not been
filed before the appointment was made
because the clerk of the court could not
be found. These statements are all in the
transcript of the proceedings that has
just been received by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth District,
in this city. â¢
"I desire to prove, if 'the court please,"
said^ Knight, "that the papers were not
filed In this case until after an order had
been, made appointing a receiver, and fur
ther; that no process was issued at that
time; and that, so far as I know, it has
not been issued at this time."
There was a remarkable scene at Nome
in the judicial presence, as related in of
ficial records of the proceedings one day
early. In August. Attorney Sam Knight
'of this city, representing the Wild Goose
Mining and Tracing Company, of which
C. D. Lane is the president, accused Judge
Noyes in open court of appointing a re
ceiver for. the company*s> claims before
any, petition for' such 'appointment had
been filed.
FISTS are shaken, pistols may flash
and a. Federal Judge may be im
peached because of the surprising
acts of Arthur P. Noyes, who wears
the judicial ermine In Alaska. Arriving
at Nome on the 21st day of last July, he
In two days threw into the hands of a
receiver the cream of the Nome mining
claims. Now In a little over a month ,
from his first assumption of judicial du
ties at Nome wealthy men and reputable
attorneys are talking of trying to oust
him from the bench, and are making most
remarkable statements, many of which
are actionable if the entire truth thereof
cannot be conclusively demonstrated.
/Both men entered the ring in superb
'condition. McCoy was heavier by several
pounds than in any previous fight. He
said himself that he never felt better in
his life and that he was never so fit as
he was for this contest. His appearance
in the ring before the fight and during
tiie first three rounds bore out all that
McCoy had said about himself. \
In the second round Corbett came up In
better form and his uneasy feeling had
evidently left him. His fretfuiness and
r.ervousness had disappeared and he gave
an exhibition which could only be given
by a man thoroughly posted in the inner
most points of the scientific art of box
ing. While not a blow was landed by
either in the first round the greater part

NEW YORK. Aug. 30.â The long-looked
for meeting between James J. Corbett and
"Kid" McCoy, under the auspices of the
Twentieth Century Club at Madison-
Fquaro Garden is over and in less than
live rounds Corbett proved himself to be
the hotter man. Keen judges of the game
who saw to-nighis fight declare that it
was the cleverest exhibition ever wit
nessed in the ring. l*p to the moment
thai the men stepped into the ring opin
ions as to their respective abilities were
widely divergent. Many claimed that
Corbett would prove to be the stronger
as well as the cleverer, and it was
through his superb feinting and heavy
slugging that he put McCoy down and
out. McCoy's friorjds all along have
claimed that he was equally as dexterous
with his hands, eyes and feet as the
former champion, and in addition to this
thry said that the Kid could hit harder
than Corbett. All who have met McCoy
acknowledge that his blows are powerful
ones and that they Fting and cut wherever
they land. To-night, however, while Mc-
Coy landed some slinging jabs, he did not
out Corbett's skin, nor aid he land a
fingle heavy right-hand blow during the
contest. On the other hand. Corbett,
when . he dropped Fcience and began to
elug. landed nard rights and lefts which
f imply took McCoys guard away, and
when Corbett found a vulnerable spot In

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 3O.-James Speyer,
who is now at his country home at Scar
borough on the Hudson, was seen there
to-night and asked concerning The Call's
London cable dispatch regarding the
Southern Pacific presidency. Mr. Speyer
was not disposed to discuss the matter
He said:
"I can only say that the board of di
rectors alone can decide upon Mr. Hunt
ington's successor. They have not yet
met for that purpose. Nothing has been
arranged. Beyond this I will say noth-
The banking house of Speyer & Co. was
for years identified with the late Collis
P- Huntington and with Southern Pacific
affairs. Since 1893 James Speyer, the
active head of the house, has been an
important factor in the financial manage
ment of the company, and although
neither he nor his partners are directors
of the company the firm and investment
interests represented by it are generally
believed to be much more heavily inter-
â¢ tcd ,i ln Southern Pacific securities than
Mr. Huntington was.^Speyer & Co. fig
ured prominently in the several syndicates
which recently bought the Southern Pa
cific stock held by the Stanford and
Crocker estates and the holdings of these
interests have therefore largely increased
during the Jast year. ThcSpeyers un
doubtedly have the power to name the
successor to President Huntington. Their
selection of an Kastern . railroad man
would greatly surprise the financial and
railroad world, it having been expected
that* either H. e. Huntington or CharhS
1 JJ*'^"'^ the Present vice presidents,
would be chosen. Such a selection would
probably indicate, however, that Speyer
& Co. and their friends are hereafter to
dominate the Southern Pacific manage
ment.
SPEYEES DOMINATE.
LONDON, Aug. 31.â Collis P. Hunting
ton's-successor as president of the South
ern Pacific Railroad will not be any man
now identified with the management of
the Southern Pacific.
Now, that the great railroad builder is
dead, the interests which for several
years have controlled the majority of the
stock of the Southern Pacific propose to
take a more active part in the operation
of the system. The first step to be taken
Is the injection of new blood into the
management.
This news comes to me from an au
thoritative source.
Charles H. Tweed, who was the con
fidential adviser of Mf. Huntington, and
who now holds the position of second
vice president, is mentioned in New York
as the probable successor of Mr. Hunt
ington. â¢ Mr. Tweed, it can be stated, will
not be made president of the Southern Pa
cific. While his worth is appreciated by
the controlling interests, it is felt that
the road- will be greatly benefited by the
infusion of the new methods. Mr. Tweed
will have, however, a prominent place in
the management.
: The presidency of the Southern Pacific
will be offered within a day or two to one
of the ablest railroad men in America, a
man who is now president of one of the
greatest railroads in the East. Although
he has a comfortable berth where he is.
it Is believed he will be glad to round off
his railroad career by taking the more
important post left vacant by Hunting
ton's death.
When Mr. Huntington was pinched In
the panic of 1893, he was forced to let go
a large part of his securities to raise
ready money. The Messrs. Speyer ad
vanced him large sums. The. Southern
Taclflc stock which they then obtained,
together with their recent purchases,
gives these bankers a controlling Interest
in the road. Whilp Mr. Huntington- was
alive the Messrs. Speyer were content to
have him keep the presidency, although
they believed a change In the manage
ment of the Southern Pacific was advisa

2A measure v:as recommended by tha
committee on the eicctlon of school trus
tees that the time of election of country
teachers be so changed that teachers will
know at the expiration of their ternio
whether they are to be retained or not.
It exeepts cities and city and county gov
ernments.
The report of theÂ»committee on the gov
ernment of the State normal schools was
j adopted unanimously as follows:
First â It is recommended that the State
RoariJ of Education as now constituted be not
chanced.
Secondâ That the laws, relating to the Stat-e
normal schools bÂ» to arhended that the State
normal schools be l'laced under the manage
ment and control of a board of resents, con
sisting of the Governor, State Superintendent
at Instruction and nlr.e other members to be
appointed by the Governor of the State.
Thirdâ The details, powers and duties of said
boiird to be defined in a bill to be prepared by
a si>ecial rommittee of this convention, acting
In conjunction v.-lth a committee appointed by
the educational commission, and that a con
t-titutlonal amendment bo submitted providing
for the purport of the State normal schools
In a manner similar to thai by which the Uni
versity of California Is now supported. !
The government of high schools was
touched upon in the report of that com
mittee. It contained a recommendation
that the following be substituted for sec
tion <> of article 19:
The public school Byitem shall Include prim
ary and crammar schools, and such hich
schools, evening schools, normal schools and
technical schools as may be established by the
legislature, or by municipal or district author
ity.; but the entire revenue derived from the
State school fund, and the revenue derived
from taxe3 collected for primary and grammar
schools shall be applied exclusively to ihe sup
port of primary and grammar schools. The
revenue derived from taxes collected for high
schools and technical schools shall be applied
exclusively to the support of such schools.
It also recommended that a committee
be appointed by the State Superintendent
to confer with the educational commission
on matters pertaining to ihe schools.
The committee on text books submitted
the following report, which was unani
mously adopted: â¢
We, the committee, strongly recommfnd that
the State of California adopt a uniform series
of text books for its elementary and prammar
schools and that said text books be furnishe-i
to the schools of the State free of charge or
of other expense.
In view of the fact that our State constitu
tion as it now stands compels our State Board
of nducatlon to comuile or cause to be com
piled a scries of State text books and seems to
prohibit the purchase by said board in the open
market of any and all text books or copyrights,
however much superior to our present series,
we recommend that the chairman of this con
vention appoint a committee consisting of five
or Fevcti of its members with power to act in
conjunction with the educational commission
in Epcuring surli a proposed amendment to ar
ticle S. subdivision T, of our State constitution,
as will authorize our State Board of Education
to purchase in th^. open market such copyright
or copyrights as may be needed for a uniform
series of ' text books for use in the elementary
and grammar schools of the State, and to fur
nish eaid text books to the schools of the State
free of charjre ox other expense.
A few sligrht changes were suggested In
the mode of levying taxes for support of
schools by that committee.
A motion was adopted authorizing 'the
chair to appoint a committee of nine to
confer with the educational commission,
to be known as a committee on legisla
tion, to whom all the proposed amend
ments are to be submitted. Superintend
ent Kirk named the following committee:
n. F. Howard, Sacramento; J. H. Strine
Los Ancles; Miss Minnie Coulter. Sonoma; U
H. Webster. San Francisco; T. 13. McCarthy,
El Dorado: L. J. Chipman, Santa Clara; Mrs
S. EL P^art, Yolo; W. C. Doub. Kern; J. P.
Grecley, Orange.
Mrs. Carrie Stevens Walter addressed
the convention in regard to the preserva
tion of the Big Basin forest. Resolutions
urging the purchase of the forest by the
Government were urged. The following
committee was nam^d to urge the Sem
pervirenp Club in the interest of saving
the Big Basin forest: L. J. Chipman T
J. Kirk. J. W. Linscott. Miss M. E. Til

Evidence Was Purely Circumstantial
and the Judge Finds Her Guilty
of Manslaughter.
SAX DIEGO. Aug. 30.â Word has been
received from Knsenada that Mrs. Ryer
son, widow of the late Governor George
Ryerson of Lower California, had been
found guilty of manslaughter and is now
serving her sentence in the Ensenada
jail. It will be remembered that about a
year ago a Mexican boy, who had been in
the employ of Mrs. Ryerson, was found
dead, hanging to a tree near her residence.
Mrs. 'Kyerson was arrested and charged
with the murder of the boy.
The evidence against her at the exam
ination was circumstantial, and the En
senada Judge found her guilty of man
slaughter. The case was appealed to the
higher court in the City of Mexico, but
the judgment of the lower court was con
firmed. The term of sentence is not
known, but in accordance with the rules
of all Mexican prisons requiring inmates
to work Mrs. Ryerson has been assigned
to the duty of matron of the jail at En
eenada.

CRESCENT CITY, Aug. 30.â Mr. and Mrs. L. Cdle, citizens of Redding, Cal., were brought to this city to
day, the latter' feeing in a m|st critical condition, the result of an accident that happened on the coast
wagon road in Curry County, Or.
The unfortunate couple were returning from a visit to Gold 'Beach when, on a grade cut in an al
most perpendicular mountain slope, the roadbed gave way and the wagon and its two occupants and the team,
consisting of a horse and a mule, were precipitated â the lady to the ocean beach about a thousand feet below and
the wagon and team, with Mr. Cole, to a lodgment against a tree some fifty feet under the grade.
Mrs. Cole's first fall, clear of all obstructions, was about one hundred feet, she alighting in the top of a myrtle
tree. Thence she tumbled, unconsciously, the remaining nine hundred feet to the beach over the cragged surface
of the declivity. }-v '=i
Mr. Cole was entangled by the harness and wreckage of the pendent wagon and team and only succeeded
in- extricating himself by the use of a .sharp knife which he chanced to have in his possession. Thus freed
from his perilous condition, he continued to slash with his knife until he liberated the struggling horse and
mule, to take the chances of their descent of the yet precipitous incline.
Mrs. Cole when found was thought to be dead, but she recovered slightly, and when b'rought to town her
condition gave promise of ultimate restoration. t Strange to relate, no bones were broken 'or dislocated. Mr.
Cole, though considerably shaken up. has no serious personal damages to complain of, and the wagon and team
escaped with far less damage than can be reasonably accounted for. In fact, the mule came out unscathed.
This narrow grade has twice before during the past few years been the scene of serious mishaps â once,
fatally, to one of the Stutts theatrical troupe, and but, recently in the severe crippling of several members of an
itinerant circus.
Mr. Cole will institute suit against Cuiry County for damages.

LAKEPORT, Aug. 30.â By trusting too
Implicitly to the honesty of his bookkeep

storekeeper at Kelseyville, has been
robbed of between $2000 and SEoOO. Numer
ous other storekeepers and business men
about town, as well, have been victim
ized, 'â¢v.;
A man who gave his name as D. Neville
and claimed to have recently come from
Mexico is the clever rogue. However, not
a great deal is known as to his Identity,
and it is believed he operated under an
alias. Xothlnc is known of his past his
tory and there Is not the slightest clew
to his whereabouts. Not even a
photograph of him can be had for identi
fication purposes.
Melville reached Lakeport about two
years ago, and nrst was employed at the
Lakeport Hotel as clerk. He stayed for a
few months and then went to Cobb Val
ley, where he became manager of the
newly erected sawmill. Thence he went to
Kelseyvllle. whore he was given employ
ment by Mr. Piner. His work was well
performed and soon 'he assumed virtual
control of the business. A few days ago
he started for the northern end of the
county with a rip from Mclntyre & Ber
ry's livery stable to buy eggs. Nothing
was heard of him for a week, when in
quiries located the horse and bugpy at
Hopland, the rearest railroad ' station.
Then for the first time was anything
wrong suspected, and a very brief exam
ination of PIner's bcolcs disclosed crook
edness in his accounts.
Until Mr. Finer hears from all the firms
with which he Oeals he cannot know how
much he is out, as Neville collected con
siderable money, with which he professed
to be payirg bills.
Besides Mr. Finer, he has victimized
nearly every business house in the town,
as well as numerous individuals, in
amounts ranging from $20 to $300.

The information contained in the above
dispatch still further clouds the situation
relative to the entrance to San Francisco
of a competing transcontinental railroad.
Kor nearly two years past it has been
known that the Yanderoilts, owning, the
controlling interest in the Union Pacilic,
were anxious to lind an entry into San
Francisco. When about a year ago it was
announced that the California North
western Railroad was about to extend its
line from Tiburon through L'kiah to Hum
boldt County it was assumed that a deal
had been arranged whereby the Union
Pacilic would extend its line from Ogden
ana connecting with the California
Northwestern thus gain entry to San
Francisco. At the same time that the
California Northwestern was extend
ing its lines the Vance people began the
construction of their roadbed, which in
Humboldt County parallels that under
rrocess of construction by representatives
of the California Northwestern Com
pany. It was Vance's hope to amalga
mate with a transcontinental line, and a
livelv war has been waged between the
two "short local lines, each being anxious
to Fell. Speculation now Is rife as to what
corporation the Hammond mentioned in
the dispatch represents. At all events it
would seem that this coast is one step
nearer the attainment of an active com
petitor to the Southern Pacific.
The John Vance Mill and Lumber Com
pany Is one of the oldest and largest red
wood lirms on the Pacific Coast and has
a largo foreign and domestic trade. The
Kureka and Klamath River Railroad,
in which the Vance estate is Interested,

of about seventy miles. Thirty miles of

?The pole object of the rtsolutinns are said
to be to score Senator Turner and Gov
ernor Rogers. The resolutions were in
troduced shortly, before the close of ihe
mornirp session and were hurriedly
passed before the RÂ«.Â»gf rs-Turner crowd
appreciated thrlr real rreaninsr. The mat
ter has created a profound sensation, as it
pinces the convention i:i a position of. con
('.â¢Â¦â¢irnirc its own work.
At the nr-rtinjf of thÂ« new Democratic
Committee Henry Dnirr.m of Spokane was
elected chairman and Senator Turner
Irr-ncnrpp
McKinloy-, may have the appointment of
B majority of the members of the court,
and should this opportunity fall to Bryan
there is reason to believe that he would
select m^ji of the most oxtreme views.
ivho could Jx- counted upon to sustain all
of the populistic ideas for which Bryan
itan-is. including a graduated income tax.
The Supreme Court consists of a Chief
Juptire and eight Associate Justices. Un
der the law ttie member! uf the court are
appointed for life, but they can retire of
iheir own rolitloa after reaching the age
of TO years or afiÂ»r having served for tea
years. One member of the court, Asso
ciate Justice Gray, is now 7J years of age
end can retire at any time.. Associate
Justice Shlras k fc and will be eligible
lor retirement at any time alter January
l<\ 1302. Chief. Justice Fuller is C7 and can
ictire at any tune after February ll, UÂ»o3.
Associate- Justice llanan la C7 and can re
tire at any time after June, r.Â«J3. Tnese
<iates are those on \ynicii members of tne
court could retire for age. Members of
the court who, if they so elect, can retire
alter ten years' service before the expira
tion of tne nex.t Presidential term are
Chief Justk-e Kuller and Associate Jus
tices Harlan, Gray, Brewer, Brown, Shires
and White.
It will be seen that there are seven pos
sible retirement?-: in view before Bryan
would get out of office If he should be
elected. As a rule, however, members of
the court continue to yerve some years
after reaching the age of permisslb.e re
tirement -and it is hardly probable that
a.11 of those wh'i will reaeli 70 years of
age Uuring t)i^ next four years will re
tire. W'luen the probabilities of death are
taken into consideration, however, it will
Ik? seen that it is not impossible that the
iiext President may have tlie appointment
of a majoritv of the members of the
court. Records show thai vacancies In
the court often occur in quick succession.
Thus President Lincoln had the appolnt
ment of one Chief Justice and four Asso
ciate. Justices; President Johnson had.no
appointments; President Qtant in his two
term? appointed a Chief Justice and four
Associate Justices: President Hayes ap
iKrtnted two Associate Justices; President
Oarfield one Associate Justice: President
\rthur two Associate Justices; President
Cleveland-; in his nrst term, a Chief Jus
tice and one Associate Justice: President
Harrison four Associate Justices; Presi
dent Cleveland, in his second term, two
Associate Justices, and President McKin
ky one Associate Justice. It is notice
able that since President Harrison's ad
ministration there have boen but three
appointments, and If the law of averages
is to be followed it would seem to be
rrobable that at least four vacancies
would occur during the next Presidential
term, enoujrh to give Mr. Bryan, if
elected, within one of a majority of the
court.

Hich Discovery Reported at the Head
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 30. -News was
brought by the steamer Mischief, which
arrived to-day, of the new placer strike at
the head of Stewart River. The news of
the llnd was taken to Dawson by a man
named Weiser lrom Barlow City, at the
junction of the McQuesten and Stewart.
He would not talk to the reporters at
Dawson, but told a friend that the strike
was made by two French-Canadians on
Dornlx Creek.
ThÂ« Frenchmt n sunk a shaft to bedrock
and pot $1 50 to the pan. They did not do
any drifting, but hastened away to record.
What few miners there were in the new
district rushed to the. "creek and secured
claims, finding prospects, so Weiser said,
equally as good as the discoverers had
received.
The news soon percolated through the
usual channels down to the mouth of the
McQuosten ani caused considerable ex
citement. Dornix Creek is a newly named
stream which tlows into the McQuesten
about sixty-five miles below Barlow City.
A stampede had begun to the new district,
which was said to be of considerable
txtent and of great richness.

KANSAS CITY, Aug. 3O.-In an address
to-day to members of the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints Joseph Smith, president of the
church, and son of Joseph Smith,' its
founder, defined the church's attitude
toward polygamy. The occasion was the
meeting of the Saints at their annual re
unlon at Washington Tark.
Joseph Smith stated In the most em
phatic worrls that the Latter-day Saints
didi'not believe In polygamy; that they
never had believed in it; that their
founder, Joseph Smith, had so stated
again and again in unmistakable words..
President Smith said:
In the doctrine and covenants of Joseph
Smith, published first in 1S35, and published
a kÂ»1 n and again after that, plural marriage Is
forbidden. The covenants are unmistakable.
Xo one of us at that time ever thought of plu
ral marriage until Joseph Smith, founder of
the church, died. Then a few years later that
branch of the church which had gone to Utah
proclaimed Its belief, ' through revelation, in
plural marriage. The doctrine and covenants
were published In Utah with that section elim
inated which forbade plural marriage. The
section forbidding plural marriage is contained
in every edition until the Utah church pub
lished its own edition.
We latter-day Paints are heart and aoul op
posed to plural marriage. We believe that big
amy forms no part of the teachings of our
church. My father has been dead fifty-six
years. I have consistently followed my father's
teachings.
I am here the representative of the Reor
ganized Church of Latter-day Salntp. I am
also here as the son of tny father. I am try
ing to follow out the doctrines of my church
and to rescue my father's name from obloquy.
My father was not a law-breaker, neither was
he a polyfjamlst. It- is for me to say this, that
the American people may not injure the church
and do my father a wrong:.

at Washington a history of the old
Custom-house at Monterey, which
has been leased by the Government to the
Native Sons of the Golden West for five
jears at $1 per year. The follcrwing is the
Collector's contribution to history:
The foundations of this historic building were
laid by direction of the Government of Spain
about 1S16, and Its construction was continued
by that Government until the revolt of Mexico,
when operations for a time entirely ceased.
After the independence of Mexico the work
of construction was recommenced by that Gov
ernment In 1S24 and continued with more or
less vlpor until the American occupation In
IMS. During this rerind the towers at the.
extreme ends of the building were so far com
pleted as to become ready for occupation by
the Mexican officials."
When Colonel John C. Fremont commanded

Special r>i!>r>atch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 30.â An affecting
scene took place, in the County Jail here
this morning when Mrs. King was admit
ted into the presence of her husband. The
strain was too heavy and both gave way.
Mrs. King was notified last night of her
husband's capture. She was stopping: at
the Burgess place, near Skagps Springs,
and was preparing to go to her folks in
Humboldt County at the time. She ar
rived here on an early train this morning
and went to the Sheriff's office. Later
she was taken down stairs. She showed
considerable Emotion when the heavy
keys turned the lock of her husband s
cell, and as the wicketed door clanged
open she shuddered and drooped her hc-ad.
Her husband rushed outside and she fell
into his arms. Both were overcome and
wept freely.
King led his faithful wife into his cell
and, locked In each othetfs arms, they
conversed privately for sorne time. King
seemed a new mail after seeing his wife.
Her presence undoubtedly did much to
revive him. The only conversation be
tween King and his wife that was-sig
nificant was when Kins said: "Why didn't
you meet me at the appointed place?" To
this she replied: "I was too closely
watched all the time." ,
When interviewed Mrs. Klnp refused to
talk of the case except through Attorneys
Lennon & Hawkins. She spoke feelingly
of the hard battle they had had. in their
six years of, married life, of King's affec
tion of the lung's and of the little ranch
in the mountains where he had regained
his health. The ranch and all they own
will now be sold to meet the expense? of
the coming trial. When asked about the
capture she said:
"I am siart It is over. What I have suf
fered in the last six weeks rannot be told,
I do rot worry now. When the true stor>
is told I have no fear of the outcome.
We will s-ell our home. I have already
sold the horses. I shall remain here for
the trial, which I trust will not be de
layed."
Mrs. King is a quiet little woman, rather
stout, a brunette; and the possessor of
lieht-blue eyes. She has taken a room In
the hotel near the courthouse, where she
will be a frequent visitor. In the after
noon lira. King carried feme fruit to the
jail and spent several hours at the offices
of her attorneys. â¢ The date of arraign
ment has been set for Saturday next, and
the preliminary examination has been
changed to the following Saturday.

MILWAUKEE, Wis.. Aug. 30.â The fifth
annual convention of the National Asso
ciation of Local Fire Insurance Agents
convened here to-day. In the absence of
Mayor Rose, Corporation Counsel Gen
eral J. B. Doe delivered, the address of
welcome. Thomas H. Geer of Cleveland
responded. ;'^...?
E. W. Wilson of Utah introduced a reso
lution that:
The National Association request of the presi

companies offering: or writing business at cut
rates, the list to be furnished on the flrat days
of October. January. April and July of each
year, and that the same be published and sent

annual address. Among his recommen
dations were the following:
A conference with the . Association of
Insurance Commissioners, offering them
co-operation and . assistance In securing
uniform and equitable legislation; means
for securing a better observance of the
law against overhead writing; the mate
rial restriction of brokerage; the taking
of advance ground in the matter of sole
agencies.
Secretary -Treasurer Frank Holmes" of
Chicago then made his annual report. He
recommended a new constitution and
platform of principles.
On account of the absence of Chairman
Jackson of the grievance committee, the
report of that committee was read by
Thomas H. Geer of Cleveland. The re
port showed a large increase in the num
ber of complaints filed, and indicated the
desire on the part of the company man
agers to assist In redressing wrongs done
agents. The report called attention to the
value of State associations in adjusting
local differences. A recess was then taken
until afternoon.
The business of the afternoon session
was 'principally . the reading of reports of
the committees on organization and legis
lation.
H. R. Pinkham, chairman of the com
mittee on State organization, submitted
its report. He said -that at the Buffalo
meeting in 1899 thirty-six States were rep

][ on sick leave aboard the United
States transport Thomas. When he
\ boarded the vessel he was suffering from
, an abscess of the liver, but luckily the
i abscess broke when the ship was a few

McKinnon has been recovering. For the
last week or so he has l>oen gaining in
fit sh a pound a day. and now considers
' himself as well as ever.
Father McKinnon was the hero of the
attack upon Manila. He went to the Phil
ippines as the Â«-haplain of the First Cali

city was under fire he offered to carry a
message of peace to the Archbishop of
the city. Under a rain of rifle fire he
walked along the beach and made a suc
cessful entrance into Manila.
When the Californians came home
Father McKinnon came home with them,
and later was appointed a chap?aln in the
regular army by President McKinley. He
is now home on a two months' sick leave,
but is so much improved in health that he
will get back to his charge as quickly as
possible.

"The California boys who went to the
Philippir.es with the first expedition would
not know the islands if they saw them to
day." he said. "Everything seems to be
settling down to a good business basis,
and the back of the rebellion is broken. A
single company of United States troops
could march from one end of Luzon to the
other and mÂ«-?t with no opposition. Once
in a while a few soldiers, sav a corporal's
guard, will be attacked, but a body of
twenty-fivo men or over will never bo mo
lested. No one knows where Agulnaldo
is, and as far as I could Icacn nobody
caros. lie is supposed to be in the north
end of Luzon.
"I' went bark to Manila on the Sher
man tn December last. Archbishop Cha
pelle went down with us and he is making
a thorough Investigation into the status
of affairs dov.n there. He js moving with
great care and oaution and Is gathering
information from all sources. Quite a
number of reforms hnve been quietly
made, but the outcome of the whole mat
ter will not be kr.own for some time to
com". AH kinds of stories are told
against the friars, and .all s'orts of stories
are told in their favor. One-half of whav
good Those self-sacrificing men have done
for the Filipinos has never been told.
Still al.l the stories are being listened to
byArchbiship Chapeile and he will draw
his own conclusions.
"Manila is now almost as healthy a city
to Live in as any in the United " States.
Under the supervision of Lieutenant Con
nors, who came home on the Thomas, the
Fanitation is almost perfect. The people
are peaceful and happy and never in th_'
history of the country has there been so
much money in circulation.
"At Xegros General Smith- has proved
himself to be an ideal governor. The
island is prospering by leaps and bounds.
i During the last fifty years there has never
| been as big- an acreage planted in sugar
; as during the season last past. Governor
1 Smith wants to come home, but the peo
; pie will not let him. He is the most popu
! lar man on the island and has made the
j spot the most prosperous in the group.
"Judge Taft is making a splendid im
pression in the Philippines. He seems
to have won the confidence of all classes
of men and the Filipinos place implicit
confidence In him. 1 think that he will
have everything in a fair way to an ami
cable pettloment before the spring.
"Major Sime of the Twelfth Cavalry is
the most popular officer in the islands.
He went to the Philippines with the Cal
ifornia regiment, but went back with the
regulars. He is the greatest fighter of
them all and the marauders run when he
is on the warpath.
"To make a lone story short I would
like to tell the California boys that tho
Philippines are not what they were two
years ago. Everything Is on a hlgrhcr
plane and even If the sword is making
the improvement possible the plowshare
Is not far behind. In every walk of life
bu5ine?s is improving and I will guar
antee that the output of sugar, hemp and
tobacco in 1901 will be greater than in any
three years in the past history of the
Philippines. And all this will be due to
the fact that in spite of the war there
is more peace and quietness and more
security in the group than ever before in
its history."
Father McKinnon says that the Filipino. 5 *
are eager to assist this country In the
present difficulty In China. When the first
news reached Manila of the Mongolian
outrages the natives went wild with ex
citement. The departure of the first body
of American troops spurred them to ac
tion.
General Pio del Pilar was among the
Filipino officers who led an army against
the American forces and whose protest
against American invasion was heard on
two continents. Recently he laid down his
arms and took the oath of allegiance. As
transport after transport sailed for the
Chinese shore he begged that he be al
lowed to organize a brigade of' natives
and fight against the heathens. He gave
assurance of -his sincerity, and speaking
for his countrvmen said they were anx
ious to be comrades in war with the peo
ple they so bitterly opposed but a short
time ago. / -: .
Plight of Bescuers.
Legation the American troops stared In
amazement and inquired if there was a
lawn party in progress. They had ex
pected to find tho relieved, in a worse
condition than themselves, whereas the
contrast between the appearance of the
rescued and the rescuers was surprising
ly in favor of the former. The British
Minister, Sir Claude Macdonald, was
shaven and dressed -In Immaculate tennis
llannels. Mr. Conger, the United States
Minister, was equally presentable. The
assemblage of ladies was fresh and bright
in summer clothing. Only a few civilians
were carrying arms.
On the other hand, the rescuers were
haggard and rough-bearded. They dragged
themselves along as if ready to drop,
their khaki uniforms dripping with per
spiration and black with mud.
But a second glance shoved that the
rescued were pale and thin. They looked
like a company of invalids. Every' part
of the inclosure testified to their tragic
experiences. There was a plat of new
graves headed with wooden crosses, in
cluding the graves of five children. The
second secretary's house was the hospital,
and it was lilled with wounded. French
nuns ministered there. At one time all
but four men of the Japanese contingent
had been in the hospital wounded.
There were several caves, roofed with
timbers heaped over with earth, which
served as bombproofs. ,
The bulletin board was covered with sig
nificant notices. For instance: "As there
is likely to be a severe dropping flre to
day, women ami children are forbidden to
walk about the grounds."
Here is another: "Owing to the small
supply of vegetables and eggs the market
will be open only from 9 to 10 hereafter.
All horse meat is inspected by a physi
cian."
Mr. Conger had the first secretary's
house. Seventy American missionaries
occupied the chapel. The French contin
gent had the pavilion on the lawn.
Bravery of Women.
The bravery of the women was note
worthy. They became so accustomed to
lire that it was difficult to restrain them
from walking about the grounds at all
times.
When a proposal was made to petition
the Tsung Li 1'amen for. vegetables some
said they would rather starve than take
help from that quarter. The Yamen's
food supply was a farce, only sufficient
for one day. When meat was asked for
the reply was that this could not be fur
nished because a state of war existed in
Peking.
The Tsung Li Yamen placarded a procla
mation exhorting the people to kill all
foreigners, because the latter had made
war on China In attacking the forts at
Taku.
The legations were fiercely attacked
from July 17 to July 25. At the latter
date a nominal truce was agreed to and
extended to August 3, although the Chi
nese repea-tedly violated it. There was
considerable rifle, fire from August 3 to
August 11, and then the Chinese mounted
smooth bores. The mainstay of the for
eigners was an old gun used by the Brit
ish in 1SG0, which was found in a junk
shop by Mitchell, the American gunner.
This was mounted on a Russian carriage
found by an Italian. Ammunition was
fitted to it and it was christened the
"international gun."
The foreigners remarked that relief had
been long delayed, but they insisted that
they had never despaired of the outcome.
The Chinese are said to admit that they
lost 3000 killed during- the siege.
The foreigners did not waste their am
munition, shooting only when a target
was In evidence. The Chinese method, on
the other hand, was a continuous heavy
and indiscriminate fire. The enemy would
advance to the barricades at night, creep
ing up with their arms filled with bricks,
and in the morning the foreigners wouM
see a new wall a few feet closer. Finally
the barricades came so close that talking
could be distinctly heard.
During the last two nights the Chinese
officers urged their men to charge the for
eigners and exterminate them before the
international forces could arrive. the
Chinese soldiers replied that they could
not stand the bayonets. On the night be
fore the relief they fired several thousand
rounds, the foreigner* replying with two
shots only. The Chinese artillery and
soldiers in Peking were apparently much
inferior to those encountered in the fight
ing at Tientsin.
The relief of Peking was a notable
achievement, chiefly for the forced march
of four independent armies over a single
difficult road and in sickening weather.
The opposition offered by the Chinese
dwindled steadily each day until the re
lieving columns were in front of Peking.
The defense of the city, considering the
possibilities of the case, was exceedingly
weak. The Japanese are still hammering
away at the wall of the northeast section,
which has not yet been entered. Probably
tho Chinese concentrated their forces
there, thus giving the Americans and
English comparatively easy possession.
Work of Americans.
They advanced along the left canal un
der cover, the Fourteenth Infantry lead
ing, with the Ninth Infantry and the ma
rines following. From a hill Captain
Reilly shelled a pagoda over the Chehua
gate until the infantry got close in. The
Fourteenth Regiment was extended under
cover before the wall, about 300 yards
away, when Company K scaled the corner
near the gate, under the fire of sharp
shooters. Lieutenant Gohn planting the
regimental flag. The regiment then
crowded with the Russians through the
gate unopposed, but every side of the
streets leading to the Tartar wall, along
which the soldiers passed, was swept by
rifle fire from the wall.
The companies dashed across the streets
In single iile. The British, entering Shaho
gate, about the middle of the east wall,
were nearest the legations and able to
enter lirst.
The last five days' marching was the
worst. It was a terrible strain. The
thermometer kept near 100. and was some
times above that figure. The country was
deep with sand and the route lay through
shadeless fields of tall corn. The Japa
nese possessed the greatest endurance
and being provided with the best trans
ports they made the pace. The Russians
held second place most of the time. The
Americans and English were pushed to
the utmost to keep up.
Japs Indefatigable. ,
General Fukashlma said that the Japa
nese might have reached Peking two days
before. He probably spoke the truth.
They seemed never to rest. Their cavalry
and scouting parties were throshlng the
country ahead and on their flanks, and
their outposts kept in constant contact
with the enemy, pressing the latter so
closely that they threw away their pots,
sleeping mats and clothing.
Several hundred Americans dropped out
from the heat" each day and came strag
gling into camp this evening. Even the
native Indian troops suffered almost as
much. The army could be tracked by
dead horses. The soldiers drank contin
ually from the muddy river and wells by
the wayside, with the. result that an epi
demic of dysentery set in. The Ameri
cans marched during the hottest hours of
the day. causing great dissatisfaction
among officers and men, who had wished
to move in the cool of the morning and
evening, like the Japanese and Russians.
But v.-ith four armies following a single
road the more enterprising grot the right
of way and the others had to follow when
they could.

TJbLbi EMPORIUM.fierce an onslaught on certain teachers,
alleging: their incompetency and suspend
ing them arbitrarily and without trial for
periods so Iopb as a year, the teacher3'
have taken the pains to Investigate hi3
own career in the department. These in
vestigations have developed several inter
esting facts. President Mark's career in
the department ha3 bien brief. He was
admitted as a probationary teacher, to
begin eervice on July 10, 1S93, at a salary
of $&0 a month.
He was assfgned to the Washington
Grammar School and conducted his clasa
in so unsatisfactory a manner that he was
transferred. He was utterly unable to
maintain discipline and affairs reached
such a pass as to become an affair of
notoriety in the department. Teachers
insist that President Mark has probably
forgotten the incident when he seeka now
to be arbitrarily severe on other teachers.
Violent Protest Against the Board.
These are the charges and counter
Charges, criminations and recrimination?,

Dueling in Italy appears to be passing from an inno
cent pastime. to _a very serious affair. Four men were
recently killed at the sporVin a single day.^
ONLY a few days ago we directed attention to
the reports to the Bank Commissioners made
bythe savings banks in this. city, showing an
increase in deposits amounting to more than $7,186,
000 over those of a corresponding period last year.
Now it is" to be noted' that reports from the savings
banks of the interior of the State are equally gratify
ing. Their deposits show a gain for the year of
$5A37<585'. so that the total increase in the savings
bjmk deposits of the Slate is in excess of $12,224,000.
It is to be borne in mind that this handsome in
crease in the savings of the wage-earners has been
accompanied by an increase in the building of homes
and by payments of mortgages and old debts upon a
large scale. Thus the showing is "one of remarkable
prosperity. It proves that the' people are living in
better condition than before, are relieved from many
of the burdens of the past and in addition have stored
up a notable sum in the way of savings as a safe
guard against any disaster that may come in the fu
ture. _,
Such being the case, it is not likely any considerable
number of thrifty voters will vote for a "change'^ next
November. Nor will they be deluded into the, belief
that "imperialism" is the paramount issue in a contest
of this kind between the party of prosperity and the
party of calamity. The question that appeals to the
common sense of the plain people is whether they
shall overthrow the party of protection and sound
money, which has brought such abounding prosperity
to all classes of industrious citizens and all sections
of the Union, for the sake of putting into power air
administration pledged to deprive our industries of
protection and to debase the coinage. 7
The workingmen who have made -deposits in the
savings banks earned gold and deposited gold. They
expect to be paid in gold. They are not going to
vote for, fifty-cent dollars in exchange for the full-:
value dollars. the banks owe them. Bryan may- be a
very clever demagogue, but he can never persuade a"
majority; of American workingmen to commit any
such folly as that.
SAVINGS BfJNKS STATISTICS.
BRYAN AND WELLS-FARGO.
WE have had many inquiries asking the reason
and significance of the sudden conversion of
Wells-Fargo Express Company to Bryan.
Â¦ That company supplied him with his argument that
the Republican party so arranged the war tax as to
slide' off corporations and fall on the people. .It ren
dered itself peculiarly offensive in that respect and its
course was generally reprehended by the press of the
whole country.
Perhaps its present course may be accounted for by
its willingness to serve Colonel Bryan in the capacity
of a terrible example. The temperance lecturqr who
found his audiences indifferent to his appeals, im
mediately became successful when he engaged an
habitual sot to travel with him as an exhibit of the
effects of sociability ?nd shoving round the can.
In this capacity Wells-Fargo has already rendered
Colonel Bryan great service. But its attitude is not
viewed' -.with great confidence by the people and they
will be less willing to accept Colonel Bryan, with his
new partner, than they v^ere to take him when he was
in business as a sole trader in popular passion and
prejudice.
Since Mr. Valentine, the president of Wells-Fargo,
carried his company over to Populism, it is noticeable
that accessions to the support of McKinley have mul
tiplied from the ranks" of those Democrats who
believe in sound money and who believe
that maintenance of the gold standard is the best
foundation for the country's prosperity and a N miti
gating influence of the severity of panics when they
Such men are not betrayed into folly by the use
of a party name and they are deaf to appeals for them
to stand in on the ground that, on the whole, it is
better for the Democratic party to win, because they
recognize no feature of Democracy in the Populistic
combination that Bryan is playing. They look ask
ance at a partnership between Populism and
monopoly, such as the Wells-Fargo-B^an arrange
ment offers.
Surely it is an angulsr patch on the crazy quilt of
the" campaign to see the Southern expansionists led by
Anti-Expansion Bryan and the anti-monopoly can
didate resting on the same pillow with a tax-shirking
corporation!
There has been. a suspicion abroad that many of the
great corporations are secretly in favor of the Sioux
Falls platform for Government ownership of all the
instruments of commerce. If they can control a
Bryan administration, sell out to- the Government at
?. good, price and retire, they will have executed a
brilliant stroke of business. The people may look at
it differently. They will be paying interest then on
a Government debt contracted in effecting^ the pur
chase, as well as supporting the extravagances of
public administration of a very large business. In
fine, the Bryan programme of Government owner
ship of the instruments of commerce opens vast pos
sibilities foV a financial transaction on a stupendous
"scale. If the present owners of those instruments
can sell them to the Government, they '"will only
need to wait for the errors and extravagance of Gov
ernment management to put them again on the mar
ket at such a reduced price that a margin, Marge
enough to gratify extreme avarice, can be made in
the transaction.

A BUBONIC BO0RD IN TEXAS.
WHEN the bubonic Board of Health in this city,
aided and abetted by Quarantine Officer Kin
youn, set about trying to create a scare and a
panic by reports of the existence ot the dread plague
in this city, there was a widespread belief that the
worst that health officers could ever do had been
done. No one supposed that in any" ether city or
State there would ever be a set of officials who would
or could beat the record. That belief was erroneous.
Texas has outdone Kinyoun and the. San Francisco
Board of Health put together. The Texas Health Of
ficer is still maintaining a quarantine against San
Francisco, and. despite the indignant protests' oi the
r.eoole. seems determined to continue it â¢
The El Paso Herald, of the 25th publishes in
full an elaborate petition from the Chamber of Com
merce of that city to the Governor of Texas pro
testing against the action of the State Health Officer,
\V. F. Blunt, and recommending his removal from
office. â¢ â¢ â¢
The "petition contains some correspondence be
tween the Chamber of Commerce and Mount, and
it will be learned with rmazement that in a note, dated
Aufru?t 16, Blunt said: "There is now, no embargo
against anything except it has .been directly con
nected with Chinatown. San Francisco. For reasons
best known to ourselves there will be no. further
modifications for" the present. In this connection
I desire to say that the public has never been fully
advised of the situation there." In a note of August
19 he said: "Yesterday I received the following
telegram: 'One white case; lived in Chinatown. One
new case to-day, Chinaman. (Signed) Charles F.
Norton.' This shows that the .lapse of time has not
demonstrated the truth of your contention that the
quarantine is not justified by existing conditions."
Who the Charles F. Norton is who sent out the re
ports of new bubonic plague cases we know not, but
it is safe to assert he is a liar of the first rank. As for
Blunt himself, his cs<=ertion that the public has
never been fully advised of the situation here is suf
ficient to stamp him r.s an utterly unfit man to hold
any official position whatever.- A man who will say
that will say anything. The situation here was in
vestigated not only by the press, by the State Board
nf Health and by a committee appointed by the Gov
ernor, but by an eminent expert, Dr. Shrady of Ke.v
York, who was employed by The Call and the New
York Herald expressly to make a full investigation
2nd an impartial report of what the conditions were.
That report was made and published and the State
Health Officer of Texas cannot be ignorant of it.
In describing to the Governor the perverse course
pursued by Blunt, the petition of the El Paso Cham
ber of Commerce says: "We beg you; sir, to believe
that in using terms which approach perilously near
the boundaries of parliamentary speech, we mean no
disrespect to you. If we were to employ the terms
that are suggested by the maintenance of these quar
antine restrictions we should go far beyond th*
bounds of parliamentary language. The indignation,
the sense of injustice and wrong under which our peo
ple are smarting have reached large proportions and
the language in which the State Health Officer's ac
tion is denounced in private conversation is not to be
quoted in writing or in print."
After that statement it is hardly worth while for us
to attempt to characterize the action of the bubonic
official. The average Texan can do justice to -bim i:i
private conversation and probably no one can do it
anywhere in print. .The man is about the worst ex
ample of a fool or worse in office that is just now play
ing fantastic tricks before the eyes of heaven. The
whole thing is an illustration of how hard it is to cure
fools of their folly and how dangerous to the world
is a lie that has once been well started. That plague
scare worked a vast injury to San Francisco and Cali
fornia and now it is proving fully as injurious to
Texas.
c-ir-JHE scandal which has been brewing
in the School Department, chiefly
jj through the gross mismanagement
and favoritism of Cecil W. Mark,
president of the School Board, threatens
to tako a form far more serious than pro
test. Instructors who have had years of
experience in the department, but who
dare not expose openly the wretched
methods now. In vogue for fear of the re
venge of Mark, declare that if something 1
is not summarily done to check the board
the department will be ruined for years.
Through the Introduction of absurd no
tions of instruction, particularly in the
primary grades, teachers and pupils alike
have been demoralized. Children of im
mature years are weighted with courses
of instruction which it is physically and
mentally impossible for them to master.
Teachers are forced, through a dishonest
classification and consolidation of classes,
to'undertake the instruction of so great a
number of children that individual in
struction is an impossibility, and the effi
ciency of the department Is daily being
undermined. '
Foisting Favorites on the Rolls.
Added to these outrages upon the de
partment is the loss of permanency in
their tenure of office which the teachers
are suffering. None know when the next
whim of Mark and bis associates will rob
them of their places and relegate them
to the unassigned list without pay. which
means out of the department. Instructors
who have been In the department for
more than twenty years have been con-'
solidated out of the schools, deprived of
their classes and of their salaries, while
a woman who has been a teacher less
than two months, but who enjoys thb
favor of Mark, Is fixed safely in a de
sirable berth.
This discrimination, which has eclipsed
anything similar in the history of the de
partment, is carrying demoralization Into
every school. Priority of service counts
for nothing and ability Is worth no more.
The only basis of success under the Phe
lan board is that of a "pull." When
Mark saw that there was an opportunity
to provide for one of his favorites in the
physical culture department he. lost no
time in accepting it. The department was
admittedly efficient. The instructors were
competent. They had the indorsement of
societies representing 12,000 men deeply in
terested in physical culture.
Luck of an Imported Athlete.
AH of this counted for nothing with
President Mark. He had a friend named
C. T. Work, located at that time In the
East. This friend Mark decided should
be placed in charge of the physical cul
ture department, and the other instructors
wore discharged. Work was duly elected
at a salary of $200 a month. Not satisfied
with this proceeding, the board went still
further in its scheme' to provide for a fa
vorlte. It determined that Work should
be paid his salary of $200 for the month of
July.
The public schools of this city were not
in session during that month. There was
neither a' need lor physical culture or the
posssibility of giving it, but perhaps Pro
fessor Work earned his money punching
the bag for his own edification or turning
cartwheels with himself.
Story of the Barber Secretary.
An 1 entry in the city directory explains
another Interesting job of the present
Board of Education. The entry reads:
"Charles Al Berliner, assistant secretary
of the Board of Education and barber, 1007
Howard street." The entry fails to state
whether. Mr. Berliner is more efficient as a
barber or as a secretary. It is interesting
to know, however, that Mr. Mark is the
close personal friend of Mr. Berliner, who
owes that distinction to the significant
factthat he is the barber of Phil Crim
mins; roustabout, heeler and saloon poli
tician. ' "Â¦
â¢Â¦â¢President Mark finds it to his interest
to (Jo favors for Phil Crimmins, and while
the president of the reform board did
not have the pleasure- cf -appointing. Mr.
Berliner i a secretary he did increase his
salary. Some of the" teachers -who arc
beginning to understand why various acts
of favoritism in the department are being

PACIFIC COAST PROSPECTS.
SAN FRANCISCO has not yet attained her
rightful rank among cities' of the Union. While
holding the position of metropolis of the
Pacific Coast, her popplation is inferior in numbers
to that of such provincial cities as Cleveland and Buf
falo. In point of trade she far surpasses each of those
cities and as a social and political center they are not
within range, of comparison with her. In the natural
order of things population should be proportionate
with wealth and industrial energy. San Francisco,
however, is subject to exceptional conditions. She
has not been able to absorb her suburbs as have East
ern cities and furthermore she is the metropolis of
one of the most sparsely settled sections of the
Union. Throughout the whole Pacific Coast wealth
and activity are disproportioned to population accord
ing to Eastern standards. We do not show up in the
census anything like so potent as we are in the actual
life of the republic.
It is probable that a similar condition of affairs will
prevail for a long time to come. We have not the
cheap lands that have attracted swarms of home
seekers to other sections and there has never been en
couraged any wholesale immigration of workingmen
to this coast. Nor is it likely that there will be any
change in such 'respects in the future. By coinci
dences of development the Pacific Coast has been from
the first a land where immigration is subject to natural
restriction. In the old days the journey was so dif
ficult it required much energy, strength and courage
to come. In latter days the high price of lands and
the forces which have held back manufacturing indus
tries have served to prevent anything like a rush of
immigration. The penniless, the unenterprising and
the doubtful have, as a rule, halted on the other side
of the Rockies. Thus it is that all over the coast we
are doing work in excess of our comparative popula
tion and are disappointed when we perceive our cities
and towns rated lower in the census than Eastern
cities that are inferior in every other respect.
" There are prospects, however, that the coming dec
ade is going to bring a wonderful increase of popu
lation to the coast. In an address before the Hamil
ton Club of Chicago on Wednesday Senator Davis
of Minnesota, in speaking of the increase of commerce
that is sure to result from the development of China,
said: "When fully completed the United States will
be the greatest participant in that trade of the Pacific
which Humboldt predicted more than seventy-five
years ago would be the greatest commerce that land
and sea have 'ever known. We need cross but one
ocean to grasp the 'wealth of Ormus and of Ind.'
Europe must traverse four seas to share it. We can
produce everything v.hich that insatiable market can
absorb, just as now we are producing and exporting
our goods, textile, metallic and miscellaneous, to
every market of the world, as the direct result of Re
publican economic policies put in force during our
Civil War and steadily persisted in by that party ever
since. This is manifest destiny; it is written by an
auspicious astrology upon the sky of a visible future.
It will give 15.000,000 of people to our States of the
It is not the statesmen only of the country who per
ceive this promise of a rapid increase of population
here. . The far-seeing "captains of industry and
finance" also perceive it and are preparing for it. In
a recent interview W. G. Nevin'of the Santa Fe Rail
road stated:
"The management of the Santa Fe is deeply inter
ested in the development of the commerce of this
port and will naturally do everything in its power to
increase it. The acquisition of the Philippines and
the history-making events that are taking place in the
Orient are destined to create a mighty progress for
San Francisco, and it is only a question of time when
this will be a really great city. In view of its present
progress the day of its greatness is not far distant.
Appreciating this situation, our company is backing
the judgment of its managers by preparing in all ways
to handle this coming great traffic."
So the movement works with a double motion. To
provide for increasing business and population the
transcontinental railroads will improve their facilities
for transportation, and that improvement will in turn
promote the very business it is designed to serve.
Thus the prospects of a rapid growth of population
are brighter than ever before. This year San Fran
cisco is ninth among the cities of the Union in point
of population and the Puget Sound ports are ranked
among fourth class cities, but ten years from now the
census men will have a different tale to tell.
public ownership under our system of government
feel confident that that would "be the result of the
experiment. Hence it may well be said that the cor
porations which support Colonel Bryan are wiser
than the children of light.
ETHIOPIA LIFTS HER HEAD.
A FEW weeks since a Pan-African Conference
was held in- the city of London. The delegates
â¢ were from Africa, Abyssinia, the United States,
West Indies and other parts of the world.
The chairman was Bishop Walters of Jersey City.
He said that it was the misfortune of the negroes in
the United States to live among people whose laws,
traditions and prejudices had.been against them for
centuries. It had been the policy of certain classes
of Americans to keep them down. It took 240 years
for negro emancipation and 100 years to attain here
his standing a soldier, therefore it was too much to
expect .that he would get complete political rights in
thirty-five years. Yet the negroes of the United
States had iti that time eliminated 55 per cent of their
illiteracy and to-day owned $735,000,000 in real and
personal property and in their struggle for civil
equality asked for sympathy, consideration and en
couragement.
The Bishop of London, addressing the conference,
said the problems Which it was to consider would not
settle themselves in a hurry. This conference, the
first of its kind held in the world, was a sign of the
tendency toward settlement. After all, the sense of
human brotherhood was a real thing, but magnificent
as it was, it created practical difficulties.
Mr. Sylvain, the Abyssinian delegate, spoke of the
natives and the colonists. He charged that there was
an anti-liberal reaction in British colonial policy for
the last fifteen years. Natives must no longer be con
sidered like serfs, workable at their masters' dicta
tion.
An address to the governments of the world was
adopted, which says: "Let not the cloak of Christian
missionary enterprise be allowed in the future, as
often in the past, to hide the ruthless economic ex
ploitation and political downfall of less developed na
tions, whose chief fault has been reliance on the
plighted faith of the Christian' church."
It was noteworthy that the members from the
United States exhorted the conference to seek jus
tice through adequate and sound education of the peo
ple it represented.
They stood for menfcil enlightenment and expert
manual training, to the end that the negro might find
himself equipped for industrial independence.
The crux of the problem in the United States is
the nullification of the constitution, by depriving the
negro of the ballot where he needs it the most as a
means of securing that very education which is to up
lift him. ;
The ballot being riven to the white illiterate and
taken from the black, it was anticipated that the illiter
acy ol the blacks may be expected to increase rather
than diminish, since continued denial of the ballot
will depend upon that illiteracy. The philosopher
and sociologist will =ee in this a menace to the future
peace of the "country. A vast illiterate population is
always a dangerous element in a popular government.
Their capacity to resist oppression is diminished as
the. desire to oppress increases on the part of the
dominant race. Both arc injured by it and civil insti
tutions, intended to establish equality, are finally de
bauched and destroyed. . Booker Washington and
others take a hopeful view of the future and profess
to believe that the blacks in the South will seek edu
cation to remove the ban to their equal use of the bal
lot. But, as without the ballot they will have no
means to secure facilities for such education, it is
no wonder that many do not share this optimistic
view. We are making of the negro a soldier, training
him in tactics and the use of arms, teaching him the
value "of military organization and at the same time
supplying him with a motive to finally turn this
knowledge of the offensive arts against us, provided
that denial of rights given him by the constitution
shall continue to the point of exasperation.

Judge Dunne Calls on Him to Produce
His Proofs, but He Fails to
Respond.
Thomas T. Townsend has awakened
from his dream of wealth. His applica
tion for letters of administration upon the
estate of his former wife, the late Mrs.
Almira Si Townsend, was denied by Judge
Dunne unJ formally dismissed yesterday.
Townsend's naked petition, in which he
averred that "as the surviving husband
of the deceased" he was entitled to let
ters, was the only evidence the claimant
could produce to show that he had any
legal right for consideration by the court,
and he judiciously refrained from swear
ing to his allegations.
Attorney G. Gunzendorfer represented
Mr. Townsend, while Mrs. Murray, who
contested the right of her father for let
ters, was represented by Sullivan & Sul
livan. Gunzendorfer claimed the petition
could not be legally considered apart from
those filed by Mrs. Murray and Public
Administrator Boland. Judge Dunne,
however, ordered him to produce his
proofs, but as Gunzendorfer was without
proof or legal right he allowed his case
to Ptand.
Judge Sullivan then thoroughly disposed
of Townsend' 1 petition by presenting the
records of the Massachusetts courts,
proving that Townsend wan divorced from
his wife in 1870. The records of the local
courts were also produced, showing that
Townsend again married and was divorced
in 1880, and that in 1SS3 he married again,
taking Josephine McGregor as his wife.
Mrs. Murray was. sworn and reiterated
her'testimony to the effect that she was
a daughter of the dcnused ami her sole
heir at lav. Judge Dunne then deniett
Townsend's petition and ordered, it dis
missed. Â¦ Gunzendorfer, though . he met
with failure before the Supreme Court in
his effort to obtain a writ of prohibition,
will appeal again to that tribunal in an
effort to secure a decision remanding all
of the petitions to the Superior Court for
joint consideration.

The ferry-boat was quickly stopped, but
before the crew launched the life-saving

was placed in charge of Dr. Annio Peck,

City will be instituted on the Zealandia.
It is known as the Daughters of Isis and
only those who are wives, mothers, sisters
or daughters of Shriners are eligible to
membership. A peculiarity of this asso
ciation is that it has no official head and
no officers, those being selected as occa

which the body is called together. A num
ber of eligibles have already planned a
programme for the trip. They have se

The ceremonies will be for the benefit
of the Shriners, who. will be asked to

X.
In the early days of the world the wants
of men were few and simple, and every
one satisfied his wants largely by his own
efforts. Such a life was independent but
wasteful. "When man began to limit his
labor to fewer things and to make ex
changes of surplus products a long step
had been taken in human progress. The
division of labor brought about by these
exchanges gave rise to factories, and an
other vast economy In the use of human
labor was established.
The extent of this economy may be
shewn more clearly by two or three Illus
trations. One person with a hand loom
could weave from forty-two to forty
eight yards daily; with six-power looms
his product was increased to 1500 yards
dally. One person in a man's boot fac
tory will annually make 1500 pairs of boots
and shoes, and in a woman's shoe factory
3000 pairs. One man with a cotton gin
can do the work of 99& men by hand in
getting the seed out of the cotton. One
man in Dakota can annually produce 550)
bushels of wheat, and, keeping 1000 bush
els for seed, the remainder, by labor
equivalent to that of one man for one
year, can be made Into flour and put into
barrels. The 1000 barrels thus produced
can be sent to New York by rail by two
men during the same period. Moreover,
the four thus working would have time
left to keep the machinery of the farm,
the mill and the railroad In repair. Three
moro in a year could bake this quantity
into bread, and, as the annual ration for
a person is a barrel of flour, the farm
hand, the miller, the two carriers and the
three bakers could supply 1W0 persons
with bread. â¢
One of the consequences of thus organ
izing labor for manufacturing purposes is
to deprive many, for a while at least, of
employment. Another is that the manu
facturer, without lessening the reward
paid to tho laborer thus employed, is able
to sell his products at greatly reduced
prices. And then, too, tne consumer Is
able to buy more. If, for example, a yard
cf cloth can be bought for 25 per cent less
in consequence of the use of labor-saving
machinery, the consumer has 25 per cent
more to spend In other ways or for larger
quantities of things he bought before. A
larger quantity, therefore, is needed to
satisfy the larger demand, and the labor
set free in the beginning is recalled to sat
isfy the new demand. This is no imag
inary consequence; it was seen long ago.
The lower prices result in releasing a por
tion of the consumer's earnings, which in
turn is spent for a larger quantity of the
same or other' things, and to produce
these more laborers are needed. When,
therefore, the full cycle of changes caused
by using machinery has been completed
the laborers set free in the beginning are
at work, prices have been lessened, the
power of consumers has become greater,
and they can satisfy more of their wants
than they could before. Of course this
movement between the discharge and re
employment of labor is not regular; some
times It comes quickly, sometimes it is
long delayed and great suffering ensues,
and in some cases it never comes.
Another consequence of the modern sys
tem of manufacturing is the creation of
large factories. In the olden time a fac
tory was unknown, except the trading
factory of ancient story. The spinning
wheel was in every house. What a con
trast between that day and ours! Now
huge plants have risen, generally owned
by companies, for manufacturing iron,
textile fabrics and everything except the
choice works of thought and art. Even
the field of literature has been Invaded In
many directions, and books written to
order are printed on paper and with ma
chinery made to order form a large por
tion of the literary wares of the day.
The drawing together of thousands un
der a single roof has given rise to another
consequence of which no one dreamed In
the primitive days of factories â labor or-
ganizatlons. They are the legitimate off*
spring of large factories. Before they
rose a trades union was unknown; when
the manufacturer drew under the same
roof a large number of men what was
more natural than that they should come
to know each other and compare wages
and modes of living and in due time form
a society for their mutual advantage'
This was the origin of these associations.
Are these great manufacturing enter
prises schools of knowledge? Like nearly
everything else in this world, good ami
evil come from them. Much is learned
that is both helpful and harmful. It
could not be otherwise. It Is often said
that the work of those employed is more
dreary because it is limited to a single
motion or operation. A person tends a sin
gle machine or moves a lever or performs
some other exceedingly simple act. The
amount of skill that he puts forth In dolnsj
this is almost nothing, but if his" brain is
not used up In tending a machine there in
more left for other uses. If we look, for
instance, into a great watch factory what
would we see? Machines everywhere for
making this complicated mechanism. But
the work Is so minutely subdivided that
almost every one Is doing a very simple
thing, making a hols in a plate, cutting
wheels and the like. Only a very small
number of persons in the entire concern
possess much skillâ those who design the
machinery, make the springs, bake the
enamel on the faces and assemble th*Â»
parts. A person applies for work and
within a week she is as skillful a3 though
she had worked for years. Now this 13
one of the good features of subdividing
labor in the manufacture of so many
groducts; persons can more easily learn
ow to do well their little task. Now, few
possess the skill to make a watch; those
who are able to make a part of a watch
Â»in a factory except the few thing* de
scribed above are numberless. If. there
fore, the modern system of manufactur
ing minimizes the skill of most of those
who- are employed it enables a vast num
ber possessing very little skill to get em
ployment.
There is another consequence perhaps
not often consideredâ the great risk of
loss, partly from the breaking and wear
ing out of machinery, and far more from
the Invention of better. Thirty years agi>
a large worsted mill In New England was
built and fitted with the most Improved
machinery. Hardly had it beer, put into
operation" before a new method of spin
ning worsted was invented. It was a very
Important invention, and if the company
continued to use its machinery it coulii
not manufacture as fine goods nor at so
low a cost a3 could a new mill with th*>
improved, machinery. The directors did
Hot wait long. They threw out nearly
$1,000,000 worth of machinery and put in
the new, and the old mills which had not
the courage to do this and continued to
make Inferior goods and at higher price
lost far more in the end. Every manufac
turer runs a risk of this* nature: never
before was human Ingenuity so stretched
to improve the methods of manufacture
and to diminish the cost of manufacturing
in order to gain an advantage over com
petitors. Machinery to the value of many
millions Is thrown aside every year to put
In other that can be run with greater
economy. That which Is thrown aside Is
a waste or loss which cannot be lessened;
it must be incurred or a still heavier loss
will result.
This accounts in part for the constant
rebuilding of manufacturing enterprises.
Some are required a3 a consequence of the
growth of the country; far more to take
the place of these that are worn out or
antiquated. Not many years ago the pro
duction of an iron furnace was 230 tons a
week, to-day it is 2000 tons, and the- fur
nace costs between 1300,000 and {-tOO.OOO to
build. The old furnace Is a thing of the
past, though many in a dismantled condi
tion may still be seen in the iron dis
tricts, reminders of a day that is forever
gone. :V.' K Â¦;,; ._:

XEW YORK, Aug. SO.â The tarty promise
cf Btrenfth in tfae stock raarket to-day was
net maintained and after a brief period of
pome activity ar.d firmness prices began to
decline aguin and the business tapered down
to the ir.Fignincant propcrtlor.s which have
become normal. Traders rightly concluded
that this Indicated that yesterday's advance
was due to nothing more than a covering of
t-hort contracts, ending the approaching three
days' holiday. The Steel group especially dis
appointed the hopes that a bull movement
â¢was ucder way by developing a heavy tone.
{Heel and Wire falling back over a point. The
American Tin Plate and the American Hoop
stocks were excewior.s and fhow good gains
tor the day. There was no news to account
for the relapse . in the group, the reports at
hand chowing a jrrrwlng demand for many
grades of iron products. There wae a desul
tory speculation in Sugar, which lifted it at
une time over a point aiter the announcement
Â¦was made of an advance In the price of re
fined sugar. But the pain vu almoM entirely
Â¦wiped out by the time the market closed.
ttrenKth in thÂ» London market helped the
market here, causing a number of sharp frac
tional cains in tli*- international shares, but
London reacted during the day and theee stocks
lost their advantage in sympathy. The rail
road statements fcr July, which appeared to
day, counteracts the favorable effect of yeÂ»
teruay's Fhowing by the St. Paul Company,
the higher level cf operating expenses serv
ing to bring down the net earnings In the
cases of Bur.ington. Northern Paciflc and
Souihern Railway, while Cleveland. Columbus
nrioir.nati and St. Louis Faved only a smali
ran of its cross Increase for net eaml.izs
The explanations which were offered for the
l:eavlneÂ»s of stocks formed Bubmltutes for news
to eorae extent. For instance, there was some
renewed Folicitude exprfFsed regarding the fu
ture of the money market. The fact that the
JJar.k of Knglar.d hnd apain offered interest on
Bold in transit gave ground for the expecta
tion that the export movement of gold may
Â¦hqrUJr be renewed. Ft.-rling exchange rose a

CHICAGO. Aug. 30.â Wheat was moderately
active and marked by irregularity. Septem
ber opened %c lower at 74&@74%c and sold
off to 7414c during early trading. This was
due to disappointment over Liverpool cables,
which showed a small decline in the advance
here yesterday. Holders unloaded some of
their stuff and found few takers until %c had
been conceded. At this Juncture St. Louis
â¢wired that 140.000 bushels had been sold for
export. This caused a shifting of sentiment
and September rallied to 7SMtC The St. Louis
news had aroused hopes that the sale there
was but the forerunner of other sales. This,
however, was not forthcoming. It was even
said foreigners were Belling here and conse
quently speculative feelings suffered another
change and the market dropped to 74V4c. The
close was rather weak, September %@hc down
at 74"ic
Corn -was strong and weak by turns. The
volume of trade was not large although at
times trade was quite active. September closed
lc lower at 40c.
Traders In oats were engaged for the most.
part In changing. September closed Me lower
at 21* 4 @21Â»4e.
Provisions were moderately active and closed
firm. The opening was easy, but a good cash
demand sprang up and the feeling became
stronger. September closed 6c over yesterday ;
lard a shade up and ribs 5c higher. '
The leading futures ranged as follows:

WHEAT â New York and Paris were weak.
Cargoes on passage were 3d higher.
Chicago was a shade lower, under weaker
foreign advices. The local operators sold mod
erately, but Cudahy was reported buying, and
this, coupled with a good foreign demand and
further rains predicted in the Xorthwest, hard
ened the market again and produced increased
activity. Receipts continued to decrease and
the feeling toward the close was bullish. St.
Louis reported 150,000 -bushels taken for er->ort
and the Milwaukee millers paid 77c for new No.
1 Northern spring. There is an estimated de
crease in Northwestern stocks this week of S30.

with a moderate demand for December.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter Is Tower. Stocks are large and the
demand has fallen to almost nothing. Those
dealers who are trying to work off their packed
goods are doing their best to maintain prices for
Iresh, but with poor success.
Cheese stands the same, but all dealers
quote a dull and easy market. Â¦ â¢
Eggs rule firm and some dealers are quoting
27c for the best ranch, while others quote pre
vious prices. Receipts are moderate and de
creasing and supplies of the best grades are
not large.

ST. JOHN'S BAZAAR
IS A GREAT SUCCESS
The Sacred Heart Orchestra Rendered
a Splendid Programme Directed
by Brother Hosea.
The scene at St. John's bazaar last night
was a very beautiful one. The J>ooths
were specially decorated on account of It
being one of the gala nights of the sea
eon The honors of the evening fell on
Bro'ther Hosea, who directed the Sacred
Heart orchestra. A regular musical pro
gramme was rendered as follows: â¢Over
ture the orchestra; recitation, F. M.-Sll
va; vocal solo, "The Holy City," sung by
snectal request by F. E. Michel; coon se
lections by Master John O'Brien; iinale by
the orchestra.
The fair is a great success, and every
night the attendance Increases. The rifle
gallery Is now one of the most popular at
tractions at the bazaar. Mr.'Finnegan pre
sented to Father Brady yesterday a beau
tiful gold watch, which will be given to
the person making the best individual
score to-night and Saturday at the range.
Gus Ewell is making the wheel of for
tune go with a swing. Last night he was
kept busy all the evening taking in
money. The fair will last only . a few
nights more. If you would care to spend
a pleasant evening take a Mission-street
car and get off at Old St. Mary's College
on the Mission road, and you will be as
sured a pleasant time. Nobody yet has
gone away that has not become afterward
a regular" visitor every night.

"SKAGUAY. KATE" NAMED
AS A CO-RESPONDENT
Company's Threat to Take Some of
Them Out Resented by Super
visors. â¢
The special committee .of the Board of
Supervisors appointed to Investigate the
telephones used by the city with a view
to reducing their number so as to bring
the cost within the appropriation of $7000
decided yesterday to postpone the investi
gation until the presence of President Sa
bln of the telephone company could be se
cured. Various propositions were suggest
ed as a way out of the difficulty.
The Mayor, who was present, suggested
that the company be requested to reduce
the rate for each telephone from $7 50 to
$3. There are about 140 In use. and the
committee thought that about twenty
could be taken out. principally in private
residences of city officials, which would
bring the cost down to the appropriation.
Superintendent Lehigh promised to sub
mit the proposition of a reduced rate to
President Sabln.
Chairman ReeQ was of the opinion that
the company "would not dare to carry out
Its threat to take out sixty-one telephones.
He contended that the company was in
debted to the city In an amount approxi
mating $230,000 in license taxes, which was
now in litigation. Reed said the charter
specifically provided that the Auditor

Seventeen Years' Imprisonment.
I W. F. Mitchell of Tuolumne County will
1 have to pav the penalty for killing John
Sheehan. He was convicted of murder In
the second degree and he appealed to the
Supreme Court from the Judgment of im
prisonment and an order denying a new
trial. In the lower court an attempt was
made to show that the ill feeling between
the two men was caused by Sheehan's at
tention to Mrs. Mitchell. The defense en
deavored to show that the killing was jus
tifiable,. but it was proved that Sheehan
was unarmed and was not attacking Mit
chell. The Supreme Court refused to in
terfere with the Judgment, which is im
prisonment in San Quentin for seventeen
years.

Judge Dunne Investigating the
Charge on a Motion to Quash
the Indictment.
Alleged illegality of the proceedings of
the Grand Jury, which resulted in the in
dictment of Fred Hansted, better known
as "Young Dutchy," on a charge of mak
ing a fictitious document in writing, is
under Investigation by Judge Dunne. A
new point has been ' raised in "Young j
Dutchy's" behalf which may have a ma
terial effect on subsequent actions of the
Grand Jury and materially reduce that
body's alleged consideration of hearsay
and outside evidence. Ex-Senator Â¦Â«. p.
Grady and Charles Pence have raised the
point In behalf of their client. The sec
tion of the code under which they are
proceeding to quash the indictment reads:
In the Investigation of a charge for the pur
pose of either presentment or indictment the
Grand Jury can receive no other evidence than
such as is given by witnesses produced and
sworn before them or furnished by legal docu
mentary evidence or the deposition of a wit
ness in the cases mentioned tn the third subdi
vision of section 6i>6. The Grand Jury can re
ceive none but legal evidence and the best.evi
dence In degree, to the exclusion of hearsay or
secondary evidence.
In behalf of the defendant it la con
tended that the section quoted was vio
lated by the Grand Jury during the hear
ing of the charge against "}Â°u n g
Dutchy." whose name was connected with
the spoliation of the Sullivan estate as
the assistant of Attorney John M. Chre
tleYi and others. H. T. Olbbs. W. T. Kib
bler Peter A. Scully and Edward Loven
thal', members of the Grand Jury, were
examined yesterday, but all denied that
they were influenced by outside evidence
or opinion: Next Friday other members
of the Grand Jury will be questioned.

JEFFRIES NOW WILLING TO
MEET FITZ AT CARSON
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 30.â Fitzsimmons and Jeffriest may fight again. The
champion came out with a statement to-day in which he says he will agree
to meet Fitzsimmons in a month. Jeffries says he wants to show the pub
lic he is not afraid of Sharkey's* conqueror and will meet him at Carson
City or any other place in the country^
"Admitting that Fitzsimmons is a great fighter. I am almost sure that 1
can again defeat him," said the champion. "In his fight with Sharkey he
appeared to me to have gone back. . He defeated the sailor in good style,
but Sharkey of to-day is not the same man that met me. I consider Kitz
simmons the next best man to myself, and I know he is entitled to another
chance. He can have it. He tried to convey the impression that because
I refused to meet him on August 31 I was afraid to fight him. I think the
public thoroughly understands that I am not a dummy champion and am
ready to defend my title against any man in the world."
Jeffries Is willine to meet Fitzsimmons at his own terms. The winner can
take all .or have the purse dividedâ 75 per cent to the winner and 25 per cent
to the loser. The champion will refuse, however, to split the purse.
If Fitzsimmons accepts the challenge Jeffries will cancel all his theatri
cal engagements.

The Edict Against "Rough House"
Accepted With Good Grace
Although Opinions Differ
Widely on the Subject.
BERKELEY. Augr. 30.â Rushing at the
University of California is a thing of the
past. President Benjamin Ide Wheeler
has emphatically forbidden the organized
rush which was to have taken place thi8
week between the sophomores and the
freshmen, and spontaneous rushing is for
bidden at all times under pain of expul
sion: The class spirit which prompted the
tying up and hazing of rival classmen
must change to something more In keep
ing with what has been called "the new
order of things" at the university.'
Many students believe that the arraign
ment of the sophomore class, by Presi
dent Wheeler yesterday was too severe
and even uncalled for. Others are oi the
opinion that the sophomores dc-served all
they got when they were rebuked by
Wheeler for rushing the freshmen. On
all sides are expressions of regret at the
lamentable occurrence in the gymnasium
la.pt week.
Student opinion differs widely on the
question of rushing: in general. Some
yearn for a "rough house" at any and all
times, but these choice spirits must now
find vent for their superfluous energy in
"lifting" icecream from church socials
and freshmen receptions. Others think
the organized rush a good thing in which
to work off an unusual pressure of class
spirit. Others hold that students of this
ago have outgrown the rush, and that
"class spirit" is merely another name for
the desire of human beings to punch some
one else's head. But there will be no
more rushing this term, and if the mem
ory of students who are still shaking over
the narrow escape from expulsion just
passed lasts there will be no more rush
ing at the State University.
On the whole the students accept the
edict against mshing with good grace.

Fall River Manufacturers Circulate
an Agreement.
FALL RIVER, Mass.. Aug. 30.â An
agreement is being circulated among
manufacturers in this city calling for a
reduction in wages of 11 1-9 per cent tu
take effect September IT, affecting all
Kail River operatives. The signatures of
mjll agents representing about IJXXmBO
spindles, or one-third of the corporations
of the city, have already been obtained.
The cause for the secrecy observed in
circulating the agreement lies in the fact
that by making the plan public now
stockhold*rs who are opposed to a reduc
tion at this period of the year might
thwart the plan of the selling committee
and buyers might discount the effect of
the reduction and irsist upon a propor
tionate decrease in the print cloth quota
tions.

and thence to Rampart City, bhe followed
and found him basking in the smiles of
Miss Levier. Hence the suit.

vesterday by Judge Belcher from Harry
Brand on the ground of extreme cruelty.
Mrs Brand testified as to her marriage to

"imilar indiscretions. The plaintiff was
allowed to resume her maiden name,
Dlckev Decrees of divorce have also

WOODLAND, Aug. 30.â The fourth day
of the "fair has been an unqualified suc
cess. While the attendance has not quite
equaled that of Governor's day, it has
been larger than was anticipated and con
siderably larger than it was on any rtay
of the last fair. The weather has beon
favorable. There has been just enough
wind to cool the atmosphere, but not
enough to Interfere with fast racing.
To-day was designated' as Woodland
day. All the business houses closed at 1
o'clock and the clerks and wageworkers
turned out in force. It might also have
been appropriately designated Winters
day. The fruit belt delegation was laree
and much in evidence. This was due to
the fact that Kelly Briggs, a Winters
horse and a prime favorite in that part of
the State, was entered in the great 2:10
pace.
.Friday will be ladles' day.
The judges in to-day's races were A. H.
Conn, President Hoppin and A. C. Ste
vens. C. A. Durfee, R. Havey and P. W.
Hodges officiated as timers.
In the 2:15 trot the field, consisting of
Psyche, Sable Frances, Bonsaline and
Hobo, sold favorite and Osito and Elmoro
for even money. In the first heat Osito
was set back from second to fifth position
for continually breaking.
After the second heat of the trotting
the' horses were called for the 2:10 pace.
Clipper was sick and was scratched.
Thorn sold at $10 and Briggs and Edna in
the field at $5- Pools sold rapidly at these
figures. The start was a good one. Thorn
led to the half and then broke and lost
twenty lengths. He could not close the
gap, and Brlggs won, with Edna close up.
In the second heat Briggs led all the way
round to the seven-eighths pole, where he
broke when two lengths in the lead.
Thorn won in 2:0S, the track record. Tho
third heat was the greatest race of the
meeting. Thorn won - by a neck. The
track record was again lowered three
quarters of a second. Thorn won the

he was asked to pay something on ac

sented for payment it was marked "no

the sacred breed of Siam and there it
means death for any one except a priest
to be found with one in his possession.
Cham is the descendant of a temple cat,
stolen from the sacred tombs at Bangkok
by an English sailor, who was paid $1000
for his possession by a London cat fancier.
The sacred cat is light brown In color, its
hair being quite short, while its feet and
head are of a dark chocolate hue.
THERE were all sorts of cats at the
first exhibition of the Pacific Cat
Club held yesterday afternoon at the
residence cf the club's recording sec
retary, Mrs. A. H. Brod, 114 Broderick
street. There were fluffy cats and short
haired cats, big cats, small cats, cats with
ribbons on them, cats with bells on them,
cats with pedigrees an.i plebeian cats in
bewildering variety and each animal had
an eager owner hovering near explaining
its cuteness and general good qualities
to all who would listen. The basement of
Mrs. Brod's residence was piled to the
celling with cats. They invaded the draw
ing-room, their cages mingling in odd ef
fect with the Chippendale furniture and
the soft carpels, but to the sufferer from
the cat fever nothing is sacred and if the
tousled Angoras and trim Siamese
felines had wanted the entire house they
could probably have had It. All day long
people came and went and prodded the
caged Thomases and Marias or stroked
them as their whim dictated, but through
it all these bluebloods of. catdom lay calm
and dignified, pome on cushions of the
softest silk and floss and some on hard
boards.
The exhibition was given to stimulate
interest among the cat owners of the city
in the club and its objects. The Pacific
Cat Club is the only organization of Its
kind in America and since its incorpora
tion last July has enrolled fifty members,
with a lengthy list posted for election. A
stud book has been opened and lectures
are given at the business meetings to
afford members an opportunty for ac
quaintance with advanced ideas in scien
tific breeding and selection.
The show made yesterday was very
gratifying to all concerned, some fifty or
etxty animals being on exhibition. No
ticeable among them were Mrs. A. Me-
Cabe's tiger cat Doc, an immense animal,
weighing twenty-two pounds. Doc divid
ed honors with Mrs. Allan Abbott's white
Angora Fluff, the finest cat of its kind
on the Pacific Coast and weighing twen
ty-four pounds. Mrs. C. E. Martling,
president of the club, exhibited Quaker,
a gray chinchilla. Tho vice president,
Mrs. Hoag, showed Buster, valued at $500,
a direct importation from Persia. The
animal which attracted the lion's share of
attention, howevert was Mrs. M. Free
man's Siamese cat Cham. This cat is of
Gonzaies Held for Robbery.
Jarr.ec Gor.zaWs, son of a wealthy
7>lar.ter ir. Guatemala, was held to answer
before the Superior Court by Judge Ca
banSss on the charge of robbery, yester
day, jn J20M bonds. He wat< accused of
being one of two men who held up rjjd

Fleeced a Domestic.
Miss Margaret Sheppard asked the po
lice yesterday to arrest George Hodges.
She said she went to Miss Dillon's em
ployment agency Wednesday and met a
man who said he was George Hodges, a
hotel-keeper at San Andreas. He engaged
her and asked her to meet him at the
ferry yesterday morning. They met and
he got $6 Â¥> from her to pay her fare,
which he said he would refund if she
suited. He told her to wait for a few
minutes and he would return. She waited
for hours, and as he did not return she
went to police headquarters. It was
learned that George Hodges does not keep
a hotel at San Andreas and is not known
there.

ir.:t'.r.s. When the body was searched at
the recuest of his relatives not a cent
â¢was found. Even the costly Jewelry
Â¦which thÂ»* d' v ceased ha/i worn was miss
ing. As it tins' positively known that the
*aJoon-keep~r had over J209 In his pockets
vhen he was taker, ill, his relatives con
cluded that the body had been robbed,
fci.d they lcs<t no titne in notifying the po
lice. An investigation by the police re
vtaled that the cash drawer in the sa
loon had also been rifle<i of its content?
by the thieves.
'Mrs. Vi'fseman, the sister of the dead
man, is justly indignant over the out
rage. She is the wife of Ed Wiseman,
â¢who is employed in the Recorder's office.
Fhe is satlMied that the desecrators of
the dead secured at lfast $200. as Bailey
Â¦was in the habit of carrying about that
much money on his person, besides the
costly jewelry which he wore, and the
orntcr.tf of the cash drawer, perhaps
amounting to forty or fifty dollars.
The man who has been placed in charge
of the saloon by the relatives when seen
veeterca.}' readily agroed to tell what he
fcm-w of the robbery of the dead.
M Eailcy was not feeling well when he
came on watch," he remarked, "and he
Â¦was advised to go h< me, but he would
not. Several hours later he was seized
with a hi'3jorrhaÂ«. and sat down in a
chair. There wrre a m:mber of men in
the saloon at the time who were friends
ot Bailey. As he was fast growing weak
er, he asked them to carry him to his
room, as he had an aversion to dying
In the saloon. He whs immediately re
rnoved to his room, where he died a short
time afterward. I was selected by the
relatives to take charge of the saloon,
and on assuming the duties 1 at onev dis
covered that the cash drawer had been
robbed of its contents immediately after
Bailey had passed away.
"Suspecting that the men who had car
ried him to his room had returned to the
saloon after he had died and rifled the
cash door. 1 closely questioned them, but
â¢without getting a clew to the perpetra
tors of the outrage. I did not learn that
the body had Iv-^n robbed until the fol
lowing day. I think the men who carried
Bailey out of the saloon committed the
casts-rdly crime. The body could not
have been co!d before they searched it for
valuables. Kalicy had a valuable diamond
rhlrt stud, a gold watch and chain and
several costly rings. a!l of which disap
peared immediately afttT he breathed his

BAILEY'S BODY
ROBBED BEFORE
IT GREW COLD
Fearful lest he should lose his license,
Jacques Miro, a saloon-keeper at 1211 Pow
ell street, upon finding the lifeless body
of an aged Spanish woman in a side room
of his establishment, coolly carried it into
the back yard and thence to the cellar,
where he hid the corpse behind a lot of
beards and barrels. The roost peculiar
thing Â»ibout tho case is the fact that Miro
did not call a physician when he lirst dis
covered the unconscious woman. He ad
mits that he was somewhat under the in
fluence of liquor at the time, lie took it
for granted that the woman was dead and
ha.sit-i.ed to get her out of the way.
"It would havu hurt my business if any
one had found her there, so I put her In
the cellar until nobody v.as around, when
1 Inteiitietl to put her in the street," said
Miro.
Hut for the entire absence of a motive
for foul play the police would be inclined
to accept Mini's story with hesitation.
The wjKun, R-husc iiiune waÂ«j Urijiiia lis
o-har, left ner home at 15 John strtet
shortly alter noon Wednosu.iy after tell
ing her uaughter that she wa-s going after

:iPIÂ»eareÂ«i at Ms saloon at 2:30 o'clock in
tiit- afuriioou ant! .isked to be trusted for
a <lrink. licing refused thÂ» woman sat
down in a smail anteroom at or.e side of
the bar. For the next n:ilf hour Miro
*ays be was busy handing out .irinks.
\\ hen tne rush was over he looked into
the anteroom and found the woman
asleep. On the tabie In front ot hfr was
a demijohn half lilled with g:n. This she
had taken from a cupboard lr. the room.
Sveing that the woman was intoxicated
Miro led her to a back room, where he
tolti her to lie down and sleep. This was
about 3 o'clock. Ho didn't see her again
until 1 o'clock yesterday morning. Upon
gehjg 1 to the back room he ?ays he saw
her lying Caes down on the floor. She did
not answer rim, and after shaking her
severul times he concluded she was dead.
The prospect of the police finding the
body there and u a natural consequpnee
ordering his place closed almost drove
Miro to distraction. In a moment he had
planned it all out. Lifting the body in his
arms he carried it into the back vurd and
then to the cellar, where he laid :t on a
pi!e of rubbish. He shut and locked the
cellar door and returned upstairs, evi
dently feeling greatly relieved. After
locking up ho went to the house of his
brother-in-law, Ettinene Montebaum, and
told his story-
Miro said his plan was to cast the body
into the Ft ret t beftre morning, and this
would clear him of all suspicion. The
trother-in-law acreed to the plan and
went for two friends to help them. They
at once became suspicious and notified
the police. Detectives Dinan and Wren
found the body at 4:."?0 yesterday morning
and ordered it taken to the Morgue.
Miro was placed under arrest. Dr. Ice
land held an autopsy on the body of Mrs.
Escobar later in the day and he reported
that df-ath was due probably to alcohol
ism. The stompch has been sent to Chem
ist GreÂ«m for analysis.

Judge Cabaniss and George D. Collins,
the attorney for the poolsellers. locked
horns yesterday morning over the case
of Daniel J. Crowley, and the Judge's re
marks were of a character that could not
be misunderstood.
The Jury disagreed Tuesday night, and
when the case was called Wednesday to
bo reset Collins intimated that it would
be better not to issue a venire, as he In
tended filing an affidavit for a change of
venue. The Judge said he could do that,
but he would not delay issuing the venire,
and set the case again for trial this aft
ernoon.
Collins appeared in court yesterday and
made a motion for a change of venue,
filing an affidavit by Crowley in support of
the motion. The affidavit was as follows:
That the said Judre is about to try the said
action and is biased and prejudiced therein,
against said affiant and In favor of the prose
cution; that said bias and prejudice Is of the
most pronounced and virulent character; that
the said Judge has actively and persistently
and outside of his official duty exerted himself
to the utmost In assisting the prosecution in
said action to obtain a conviction therein of this
affiant, upon the charge made In the complaint
on file in said action; that the said Judse has
openly and notoriously made himself the zeal
ous partisan of the said prosecution and has
declared it to be his purpose and Intention to
secure a conviction of said affiant upon said
charge; that there has been one trial of said
action before a Jury, at which trial said Judge
presided; that at said trial said Judge
endeavored to his utmost, first to entice and
then to cocerce the Jury into a verdict in favor
of the prosecution, and expressed his chagrin
and disappointment that the members of the
Jury had failed to convict affiant of the said
charge. Affiant further eays that It is abso
lutely Impossible tot/ him to obtain a fair and
Impartial trial if said Judge presides at the
trial of said action; that said Impossibility
arises from the fact that said Judge Is intense
ly biased and prejudiced afirainet affiant's case,
and In favor of the prosecution in said action
and because of said bias and prejudice and en
tirely influenced thereby the said Judge vriU
not and cannot accord to affiant a fair trial.
Affiant charges that said Judge is in league
with said prosecution to obtain a conviction
of affiant in the said action, at all hazards,
and in any event.
Attorney Coffey, special prosecutor, ob
jected to the affidavit being filed. He said
it was scurrilous, and such a proceeding
was not countenanced by any rule of law
known to him. Collins argued that the
Penal Code provided for just /such a pro
ceeding if the circumstances warranted it.
The Judge coincided with Collins and
ordered the affidavit to be filed. Then he
said the case would go on this afternoon
as previously fixed.
Then the Judge, after a moment's pause,
caused a sensation by saying:
"I will say that the affidavit filed hero
is absolutely and utterly false. It Is false,
not only morally speakingâ not only is it
a plain, ordinary, everyday lie put In the
form of a sworn affidavit â but more than
that and worse than that, it is a piece of
cold-blooded, deliberate perjury on the
part of the affiant."
Collins said the affiant took exception to
that gratuitous remark on the part of the
"Very well," retorted the Judge, "and 1
will say to counsel that he need not Inter
rupt me again. I want no more flippancy
on his part. The allegations with refer
ence to the attitude of the court toward
the prosecution I will not dignify by a de
nial. It would be unworthy of myself and
inconsistent with my self-respect to con
descend to notice such infamously false
and indecent and slanderous accusations,
whether made in the form of a formal af
fidavit or otherwise. If there were any
way by which I could consistently Â¦with
my sense of duty and consistently with
my self-respect acquiesce in the request
or desire of this defendant nothing would
give me more pleasure than to do It sim
ply and solely for this reason â that my
experience in two or three trials in which
I have already sat in cases of this gen
eral character is that the court is put to
a great deal of personal discomfort and
annoyance by them, and if I were a duty
shirker I would only be too glad to avail
myself of this or any other pretext that
would result in taking them out of my
department. I have already Indicated my
state of mind and feeling toward this de
fendant personally, even despite the riling
of this affidavit, in connection with which
I regard him as perhaps the unwitting
tool or instrument rather than the Insti
gator of the falsehoods with which It
teems."
When the Judge concluded his philippic
Collins said he was not prepared at that
time to prove the allegations set forth
in the affidavit.
The Judge retorted: "Isn't it because
you know they are lies and you cannot
prove them?"
This ended the proceedings In court.
Later Collins said he could prove the al
legations. He &aid:
"When the Jury In the case was out
Tuesday night I walked down town- with
the Judge. We were accompanied by Joe
Mohan, a clerk in Corbett's employment.
We talked about the case, and the Judge
remarked that he thought a con\-ictlon
should be had at all hazards and that he
would do all he could to secure one. Then
the Superior Court would pass on what
constituted a pool, and whatever Its ruling
might be he would follow it as he would
follow the polar star. \. hen we returned
to the City Hall the Jury asked to come
out, as it could not agree and wanted fur
ther instructions. Just before the Jury
was admitted to the courtroom the clerk
of the court spoke to the Judge, and he
left the bench and went to the office of
the Chief of Police. We had him shad
owed. When he returnea he instructed
the Jury to convict, as that was the only
thing to do. If they could not agree they
had violated the law. This he practically
reiterated when the jury came in for the
last time and disagreed."
Collins' statement was denied by the
Judge except admitting that a conversa
tion took place between them. What the
Judge said at that time was that he hoped
a conviction would be secured In one of
the cases soon, so that the question of
what constituted a pool could bo deter
mined by the Superior Court, and then he
would have to bow to the opinion of the
appellate court. He denied that he tried to
coerce the Jury, and said his instructions
were according to law. Collins had asked
him to give instructions that would have
confused the jury, and he refused to do so
It is expected that there will be sensa
tional developments when the case la
called this afternoon.
