AN A ARCHITECTURAL POEM SET TO MUSIC
DEDICATED TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA
CLAUS SPRECKELS.
GENERAL W. H. L. BARNES.
That the memorial should be placed in Gold
en Gate Park was a decision which required
no' long study to reach. This noble pleasure
ground will doubtles be the chief scene of the
cpen air festivities of the people of California
and indeed of the whole Pacific Coast for all
time to come. It already ranks among the fin
est parks in the world. It is the resort of
thousands. It Is the playground of the chil
dren, the festal garden of youths and maidens,
the recreation of the worker," the solitude 01
the thinker, the .parade of wealth and fashion,
the object lesson of artists, and In many ways
It ministers to the studies of men of science.
dedicated to music rendered free to all and
under circumstances that would make it at
tractive to rich and poor alike. (Applause.)

pleasures which recreate body and brain alike..
No other form,~of amusement : which, can -be
provided for large numbers surpasses music In
that respect, and accordingly I was easily de
termined that the purposed memorial should be
RECREATION FOR
BRAIN AND EODY
ALIKr.
In my native Germany I had early learned
the value Â«Â» well as the charm of music and
of architecture. I know how potent a benefit
It Is to a people to have the privilege of listen
ing under beautiful surroundings to the melo
dies and the harmonies which the master mu
sicians have developed out " ol their soaring
souls for the joy of the world.

Â¦ gles of men Is to
IvOvinR California as I do, and being grateful
for the many benefits that have accrued to me
during the earnest and active life I have lived
here, I have desired to manifest those feelings
in some monumental structure which would
stand as a memorial of my citizenship among
you. Â¦ In deciding to erect that memorial In the
form It has taken. I was moved by a desire
to make it a source of the highest pleasure and
good to the largest number of people possible.
(Applause.)
It !s a gratification to me to know that Cal
ifornia, so kind to me. Is kind and generous to
all. Differences of fortune exist In all parts of
the world, but each class of workers Is better
off in California than anywhere else on earth.
Our workingnien have the best homes and the
hlRhest wages in proportion to their skill that
are possessed by workers anywhere, and It Is
an Invariable rulo that where wase-earnrrs are
most prosperous 1 and have most opportunities
to advance !n fortune, education and culture,
there every grade of society Is most prosper

To your hands. General Barnes. a3 a repre
sentative of tjie people of California. I commit
the gift. My wish Is that the pavilion ar.-l the
music which will flow forth rrom it may be
incentives to artistic aspirations among all the
people of California, and help them to find
that happiness which humanity Is to attain tn
this golden land in a more abundant degree
than in any other under the whole heavens.
As Mr. Spreckels finished he grasped
General Barnes' hand and shook it cor
dially. Barnes then accepted the bulld
lne in behalf of the citizens of San,
Francisco and the Park Commissioners.
He said:
My Fellow Citizens: This Immense concourÂ»Â«Â»
demonstrates the deep interest which the peo
ple whom I have the distinguished honor to
represent to-day take !n the completion
and dedication of this architectural tri
umph of the Reid Bros., rendered pos
sible through the generosity of Mr. Claus
Spreckels. who may be Justly denominated the
foremost living citizen of California. For him
self and for the State his has been a most for
tunate career* net so fortunate, perhaps, as it
is rather the natural result of rare executive
ability and absolute Integrity In affairs, of In
domitable force cf will in the undertaking ar.d
triumphant completion of commercial enter
prises which have benefited the pecple far moTÂ«
than they have enriched him. The gigantic
Industries which have been developed by this
good citizen have for many years furnished
homes and maintenance to more human beings
than those of any other Individual or Indeed of
any aggregation of capital In this State.
The great refineries erected and operated by
him. the railway transportation provided by
his efforts, the construction of public utilities
of power and light, the productive farms which
have made fertile so many thousands of acres
and heaped so many millions of tons of the
saccharine beet about his monster factories of
sugar, to say nothing of the substantial and
beautiful structures with which he has orna
mented our chief city and given employment tr>
every mechanical trade, demonstrate his public
spirit and entitle him to the full measure of
affection and respect which the people la whose
behalf I speak entertain for him.
That to-day has been selected to devote this
temple of music to the perpetual use of the
people la especially felicitous. It connects it
with an historical epoch In the life of. the
commonwealth which marks its semi-centennial
with the pride of an exultant population, re
joicing In the review of a past, munlfleent In
progress and illuminated by the prophecy of
acquisitions of wealth and civic power which
bewilders contemplation ana stretches tram, til*
SCENE BEFORE THE NEW BAND STAND AT THE DEDICATION.
SEATING CAPACITY FOR TWENTY THOUSAND
Not Half Enough
for the Crowds.
WITH Beyenty-flve thousand peo
ple bending their heads to
listen, the first melody welled
from the new band stand in
the Park, and, borne on the
wJrig^s of the west wind,
thrilled the a'r of Concert Valley. It was
the dedication of the plare, and the
stately pile of gTay sandstone, to music
and the people, and the first composition
played under Its arche?, aptly named
"Immortality." was dedicated to Claus
Sjirec-Uc-Js, the giver of the gift.
The peristyle is, as General Barnes
truthfully and br-autifully said, an archi
t-M-tural pot'm, set to music. It is beauti
ful In its pure simplicity, in the stateli
r.Â« ss of its columns, and in its graceful
scheme and outline. And it is wonderful,
too. from the purity of its aeou-stics, for
the s; ; h of the flute !s Bent down the val

Hccnc. Tha bluish pray tint of the stone
of which th<> structure Js built brings out
boldly fiom the dark-foliapcd background
th. artistic work of the bu'Ioer.
F^uts were provided for 29,000 peo
!>!'-. which, on ordinary occasions, would
more than answer all n*Â»eds. Vet yester
fiaVx great crowd tva only overtaxed
tf:js Immense capacity, but the
torr3<-e<i grounds along the outer
boundaries of the court were black with
humanity.
The orchertra platform has an ex-
width of Â« feet and will accommo
date 100 musicians, which number were
there yextrrdar. As Mr. Spreckels and
General W. H. I,. Barnes stepped into the
music stand there was a spontaneous out
burst <!f appluuee from the vast multi
tude. Mr. Bpreckels bowed and then be-
gan his presentation speech. He was fre
quently interrupted by vigorous hand
clapping. Mr. Spreckels said:
My Fellow Cltitzer.s: By a good fortune In
which you will all Join with me In rejoicing,
the completion cf this structure and the oc
casion of Its formal gift to the people come
at a time when thousands from all parts of
tlie commonwealth are thronging to San Fran
cisco to celebrate the fiftieth aniversury of the
admission of California to Btntrhood in the
Union. We must all of us be well pleased that
It has happened so; for the structure Is de
glgnrd not for the city only, but for all Cal
ifornia, and It Is therefore rlcht and fitting
that Its dedication should take place under cir
cumstances which make It not a civic holiday
only, but a part of a great State festival.
California has been for fifty years a State
of the American Union, and I have been for
nearly fifty â¢ yeara a citizen of California. I
was rnnone those who cam* in early manhood
to take part in the development of the rich re
sources of this golden land and to lay the
foundations upon which the fabric of her pros-
Parity rests. Whatever may have bt-en the ex
perience of others, my labors In California
have been abundantly rewarded. This has
been no nig-gard land to me. I have found
Its people as generous as the soil, ajid society
here as rich in human virtues as are the
mountains with gold. My experience has been
that whosoever works in California with the
honesty of a true Industry, and who meets the
It Is right for me to give due praise here to
the architects who have fashioned the noble
proportions of the structure, and to the arti
sans whose skill has carrted out all that I
have planned and the artist designed. The
architecture has been conceived In harmony to
the use for which the structure is Intended
and to the magnificent landscape of park and
mountain* that surround it. It pleases the
eye as music pleases the ear, and ever}- faculty
Here, then, where all gather. It Is proper that
the music which charms them should be pro
vided with a stately and noble pavilion. Thus
the plan for the edifice grew in my mind and
purpose; and now I have the gladness to look
upon the completed work and to transfer It
to the people of California. (Applause.)

rade to-day will be Napoleon Bo

hauled down the Bea^r Flag at
Sutter Fort and who assisted In
the raising of the Stars and Stripes fur
ever over thfl territory of California. He
Is a very old man who has long passed
the allotted term of man's life, but he is
hearty and lively while bearing his
eighty-three years.
"I came down here at the urgent re
quest of the Native Sons' Committee."
saici Mr. Smith, "but I do not kr.ow
whether or l.ot they will make a monkey

founders of this great city and thought
I knew something ar>out it, bit I am lost

gives me pleasure to say that I hauled

that If the rights of American citizens
were ignored there would be genuine
trouble I crossed rhe plains in 1S15.
"The arrtst of my party was actually
what led to the organization of the now
f^rr.ous order of Native Sons. What I
mean is that the time came when there
was no consideration for the rights of Ca!
ifornians. and the consequence was that
we pulled down the I<ear Flag- of .the Cal

ordered out of the country and was on
his way to Oregon, when Litutenant Gil

formed us that war had been declared
with Mexico. Then up went the American

At the same time I look upon this city

The decorations in the meeting places
of the various parlors have been marked
by a wealth of color. Flags and bunt

the headquarters into beautiful bowers.
At Headquarters.
The Palace Hotel headquarters of the
general committee was crowded all day
yesterday by Native Sons, who called to
pay their respects to old-time acquaint
ances on the committee. There were
present all day long members of the pa
rade committee to assist Colonel Boxton,
the chief of staff, in giving information,
in regard to positions In line and telling
marshals of divisions and aids what they
are expected to do thi3 morning.
It is the intention of the grand marshal
to move immediately upon the giving of
the signal, and nil organizations not in
position it the appointed time will be
relegated to the end of the procession.
JWs variously estimated that the thirty
*Â«f divisions, with the numerous floats,
win take from three and a half to four
hours in passing a given point. The
grand marshal and chief of staff have in
structed the marshals to have all car
riages, excepting four, driven two abreast
so as to curtail the length of the proces
sion, and no formation will be allowed
to march in less than columns of four.
Whenever practicable all organizations
will be required to march eight abreast.
Throughout the afternoon and evening
the rooms of the Fresno Parlor, In the
Lick House, were thronged with mem
bers of the organization. Refreshments
were served without stint, ana every per
son who visited the headquarters was
made comfortable. Ninety-live members
of the organization are expected to turn
out this morning. The members will wear
white duck trousers, white silk negligee
shirts and straw sombreros. Fulton G.
Berry, familiarly known as the "Com
mordore of Fresno County," will act in
the capacity of mascot in the parade. lie
will be mounted and will be a striking
feature of the parade. George C. Roed
ir.g, v.ho stands 6 feet l'/fc inches In height,
and is built in proportion, will lead the
members on the line of march. He will un
doubtedly attract attention by reason of
the monster sombrero he will wear and
the huge cane he will twirl. The straw
sombrero is large enough to conceal a
man and the cane could be used by a
barbarian for a war club. It is fantasti
cally carved and weighs In the neighbor
hood of twenty pounds.
Reception by Sunset.
Sunset Parlor of Sacramento held a re
ception from 2 to 5 in the banquet hall of
the Lick House. A grand ball will be

WHERE THE GLAD
HAND IS FOUND
At the conclusion of General Barnes'
address the Golden Gate Park band
struck up the familiar "Star? and
Stripes." The selection proved a fitting
one for the moment, for tho pulse of the
vast throng was at a high tension of en
tnusiasm, and it prepared the way for
what was to follow, an overture, "Immor
tality." dedicated to Mr. Spreckels by A.
Fpadlna. The piece ended with the "Star
ppangled Banner." a refrain that brought
every man with raised hat to his feet.

lumber was blown down and there was
much damage to property at Village Mills.

sion steamer John PJndicott. on the Bos
ton and Plymouth line, struck a sunken
rock just east of MInots I-lght thi3 after
noon and tore a hole In her side, so that
she was obliged to run full steam for the
shore off Xorth Scituate. where^he foun
dered. There were on board COO passen

the hasty use of all her lifeboats, and
with assistance from the boats near by,
every person aboard was saved.

NEW ORLEANS. Sept. 9.â The damage
in the storm-stricken section along the
Mississippi River, starting thirty miles
below this city and reaching to the gulf,
is $100,000 to the rice crop and a like
amount to truck farms, cattle, poultry
and other property. Tho river rose six
feet during the storm and flooded the
country through which It 'passed. The
disabled steamer Oteri was towed Into
Port Eads with everybody aboard well.
She will be towed to this city for repairs.

HOUSTON*. Sept. â¢>.â The Santa Fe train
which left here at 7:55 Saturday night
was wrecked at a point about wo miles
north of Alvin. Mrs. Prather of Rosen
berg. Tex., was killed, and several other3
were injured.
The train was running slowly when it
encountered the heavy storm. It is re
ported that the train was literally lifted
from the track. Mrs. Prather was thrown
across the car and half way through a
window. When the car was reached it
was found that her head had been un
der water, and she was drowned. Sev
eral passengers. Engineer John Martin,
Fireman Thomas Doyle and Conductor
M. H. Donnelly were killed.
SANTA FE TBAIN IS .
LIFTED FROM THE THACK
The lat** peaches, which were plentiful
and which had been sold in advance, were
swept clean from the trees. In Central
Texas 50,000 late peach trees have been
planted within the last three years. The
crop of fruit on these trees is all gone,
and also other late fruits. The vineyaTds
present a scene of desolation.
WACO. Tex.. Sept. 9.â The wind blew
tempestuously here from 3 o'clock this
morning until 5 this afternoon, the chief
damage being to fruit trees and the cot
ton crop. The cotton plantations in the
Brazos Valley look as if armies had
fought battles in them, the plants being
laid flat on the ground. The .wind blew
sixty to seventy miles an hour for four
tc.cn hours before subsiding.
DESOLATION IN
THE COTTON FIELDS
"I was in the storm which struck Gal
veston in 1S75, but that one. bad as it
was, was nothing in comparison with
Saturday's. The Gulf and bay are full of
wreckage of every description and it
seems as If ever? frame house in the
town must have been blown down and
knocked to pieces. Judging from the
amount of driftwood that Is floating
about. I am going back to Galveston
jus; as soon as I can to find my sister's
body and those of her children."
I have no idea how many lives were lost,
but think there will be several thousand
deaths reported besides many people
whom we will know nothing about.
In Houston one person was killedâ
Henry Black, a hack driver. The, prop
erty damage is great, a conservative esti
mate placing It at $250,000. The Merchants'
and Planters' Oil Mill was wrecked, en
tailing a loss of $40,000. The Dickson Car
wheel Works Buffered to the extent of
Three persons wore drowned at Mor
gans Point and othc-rs are missing. With
the exception of those of Mr. Nicholson
and Mrs. Jane Woodlock, the bodies of
the dead have not yet been Identified.
The bodies have been brought in irom
Seabrooke, on GalveFton Bay. and seven
teen persons are mis^ins there.
HOUSTON. Sept. 9â Sabine Pass has not
been heard from to-day. Yesterday morn
ing the last news was received from
there, and at that time the water was
surrou"n<!ing the old town at the pass and
the whvl was rising and the waves com
ing higher. From the new town, which
1? some distance back, it was reported
that the water had reached the depot and
was running through the streets. The
people are leaving for the high country
known as the Lark ridge, and it is be
lieved th.it all escaped.
MANY MISSING
AT SEABROOKE
There is no way of estimating the prop
erty damage at present. So far as ho
could see or hear, Mr. Timmins says the
east end of the city, which iB tho residence
fiislrict. has been practically wiped out of
existence. On the west end, which faces
the gulf, another portion of the island,
very much havoc was done. The beach
was swept clean, the bath houses are de
stroyed and many of the residences are
total wrecks. Â» r /
Provisions will be badly needed, as a
great majority of the people lost all they
nad. The waterworks power house was
wrecked and a water famine is threat
ened, as the cisterns â¢were all ruined by
the overflow of snlt water. This Mr. Tim
mins regard? .is the most serious problem
to be faced now. The city is in darkness,
the electric plant having been ruined.
Provisions Needed.
The city of GaJveston. he said, is now
entirely submerged and cut off from com
munication. The boats are gone, the rail
ways cannot be operated and the water
is so high that people cannot Â¦walk out
hy way of the bridge across the bay,
even should that bridge be standing.
In the bay the carcasses of nearly 200
horses and mules were seen, but no' hu
man body was visible. The scones during
the storm. Mr. Timmins said, could not
be described. Women and children were
crowded into the Tremont Hotel, where
he was seeking shelter, and all night these
unfortunates were bemoaning their loss
of kindred and fortune. They were group
ed about the stairways and in the gal
leries and rooms of the hotel. "What was
occurring in other parts of the city he
eould only conjecture.
Mourning for Lost Ones.
tions were generally crowded and as they
were substantial ouildings the chances
are that many persons had taken refuge
in them.
The water extended across the island.
Mr. Timmins said it was three feet deep
in the rotunda of the Tremont Hotel and
'six feet dÂ«^ep In Market street.
Merchandise Destroyed.
Along the water front the damage was
very great- The roofs had been blown
from all the elevators and the gheds along
the wharves were either wrecked or had
lost their sides and were of no protection
to the contents. Most of the small sailing
craft were wrecked and were either piled
up on the wharves or floating bottom side
up in the bay. There Is a small steamship
ashore thrrÂ«Â» miles north of Pelican Isl
and, but Mr. Timmins could not distin
guish her name. She was flying a British
flag. Another l*ig vessel had been driven
ashore at Virginia Point and still another
is aground at Texas City.
At the south point of Houston Island
an unknown ship lies in a helpless con
dition.
The lightship thnt marks Galveston bar
is hard and fast aground at Bollivar Point.
Mr. Timmins and the men with him
on the schooner /e.Â«oued two sailors from
the middle bay who had heen many hours
in the water. These men were foreigners
and he could gain no information from
them.
A wreck of a vessel which looked like
a large steam tug was observed just be
fore the party landed.

THOUSANDS OF DEAD STREW
THE RUINS OF GALVESTON
HOUSTON. Tex.. Sept. 9.-Gal
veston remains isolated. Ef
forts were made to get spe
cial trains and tugs to-day
with which to reach the isl
and city. The railroad com
panies declined to risk their
locomotives.
All sorts of rumors prevail, but with no
substantial basis. It is known that the
railroad bridges across the bay at Oalves
ton are either wrecked or are likely to be
destroyed with the wetpht of a train on
them. Tho approaches to the wagon
bridge are gone and It is rendered use
less.
The bridge of the Galveston. Houston
and Northern Railroad is landing, but the
drawbridges over Clear Creek and at
Edgewater are gone and the road cannot
get trains throush to utilize the bridge
across the bay.
A train went down the Columbia Tap
road this afternoon as far as Chenango.
The town was greatly damaged and the
bodies of nine negroes were taken from
the ruins of one house. The train could
proceed no further and came back to
Houston, leaving the fate of the people
at Angleton. Columbia. Brazora, Velasco
and Quintana uncertain.
The town of Alvin la reported to be
practically demolished. Hitchcock has
suffered severely from the storm, while
the little town of Alta Loma is reported
without a house standing. The town of
Pearl has lost one-half of its buildings.
President Carlton of the BusineTa
League of Alvin and a prominent mer
chant there, reports that not a building li
left standing In the town, either business
or residence; stocks of goods and house
furniture are ruined and crops are a total
less.
The small town of Brookshlre on the
Missouri. Kansas and Texas, was almost
wiped out by the storm. The crew of a
work train brought this information.
"When the train left there the bodies of
four persons had been recovfred and the
search for others was proceeding.
Ilempstead, across the country from

interference to the military authorities of the
TJr.'ted .States, now In control of the Philip
pines, to ascertain what amelioration in the
condition of the Inhabitants and what improve
ments In public order may be practicable, and
for this purpose they will study attentively
the existing social and political state of the
various populations, particularly as regards the
forms of local government, the administration
of justice, the collection of customs and other
taxes,, the means of transportation and the
need of public improvements. They will re
port* â¢ â¢ the results of their observations
and reflection! and recommend such executive
action aa may from time to time seem to
them wise and. useful. The Commissioners are
hereby authorized to confer authoritatively with
any persons resident In the Islands from whom
"In the performance of their duties the com
missioners are enjoined to meet at the earliest
possible day in the city of Manila nnd to an
nounce by a public proclamation their presence
and the mission intrusted to them, carefully
anting forth that while the military govern
ment already proclaimed is to be maintained
and continued so long as necessity may require,
efforts will be made to alleviate the burden
of taxation, to establish Industrial and com:
mercial prosperity and to provide for the safety
of persons nnd of property by such means
as may be found conducive to these ends.
Their Instructions contained the following
In order to facilitate the most humane, pacific
and effective extension of authority throughout
these islands and to secure with the least possi
ble delay the benefits of a wise and generous
protection of life and property to the inhabi
tants. I appointed in January, 1899. a cornmis
misftlon consisting of the Hon. Jacob Gouhl
Sehurmann of New York, Admiral George
Dewey, U. S. N. ; Charles Denby of Indiana,
Professor Dean C. Worcester of Michigan and
Major General Elwell E. Otis, U. S. A.
Instructions to Philippine Commission
â¢â'â¢ â¢ . â¢ The military, commander of the
United States Is enjoined to make known to
the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands that.
In succeeding to the sovereignty of Spain, in
severing the former political relations of the
Inhabitants and in establishing a new political
power, the authority of the United States Is to
be exerted for the securing of persons and
property of the people of the islands and for
the confirmation of all their previous rights
nnd relations. It will be the duty of the com
mander of. the forces of occupation to announce
and proclaim in the most public manner that
we come not as invaders or con
querors, but as friends to protect the
natives in their homes, in their em
ployment and in their personal and
religious rights."
Twenty days thereafter, on l>ecember 21, the
following direction was given to the com
mander of our forces In the Philippines:
From the standpoint of Indemnity both the
archipelagoes (Porto Rico and the Philippines)
are insufficient to pay our war expenses, but,
aside from this, do we not owe an obligation
to the people of the Philippines which will not
permit us to return them to the sovereignty of
Spain? Could we Justify ourselves In such a
course or could we permit their barter to some
other power? Willing or not, we have the re
sponsibility of duty which we cannot escape.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The President cannot believe that any
division of the archipelago can bring us any
thing but embarrassment in the future.
The treaty of peace was concluded on Decem
ber 10, 1S98. By its terms the archipelago
known as the Philippine Islands was ceded by
Spain to the United States. It was also pro
vided that tho "civil rights and political status
of the native inhabitants of terirories hereby
ceded to the United States shall be determined
by Congress."
Treaty of Peace.
"The trade and commercial side, a3
well as the indemnity for the cost
of the -war, are questions we might
yield. They might be waived or com
promised, but the questions of duty
and humanity appealed to the Presi
dent so strongly that he can find no
appropriate answer but the one he
has here marked out."
"Without any original thought of complete
or even partial acquisition, the presence and
success of our arms at Manila Imposes upon
us obligations which we cannot disregard. The
march of events rules and overrules human
action. Avowing unreservedly the mirpose
which has animated all our effort and still
solicitous to adhere to it, we cannot be ui;
mindful that without any desire or design on
our part the war has brought us new duties
and responsibilities which we must meet aud
discharge as becomes- a great nation on whose
growth and career from the beginning the
rjler of nations has plainly written the high
command and pledge of civilization."
Instructions to Peace Commission.
On October 28. ISPS, while the Peace Commis
sion was continuing Its negotiations in Paris,
the following additional instruction was sent:
"It Is Imperative upon us that as victors we
should be governed only by motives which will
exalt our nation. Territorial expansion should
be our least concern; that we shall rfot shirk
the moral obligations of our victory is of the
greatest. It is undisputed that Spain's author
ity is permanently destroyed in every part of
the Philippines. To leave any part in her feeble
control now would Incerase our difficulties and
be opposed to the interest of humanity. â¢ â¢ â¢
Xor can we permit Spain to transfer any of the
islands to another power. Xor can we invite
another power or powers to join the United
States in the sovereignty over them. We must
either hold them or turn them back to Spain.
"Consequently, grave as are the responsibili
ties and unforeseen as are the difficulties which
are before us. the President can see but one
plain path of duty, the acceptance of the archi
pelago. Greater difficulties and more serious
complicationsâ administrative and International
âwould follow any other course. The Presi
dent has given to the views .of the commis
sioners the fullest consideration, and. reaching
the conclusion above announced. An the light of
the Information communicated tiPthe President
Flnce your departure, he has been influenced by
the single consideration of duty and humanity.
The President is not unmindful of the distressed
financial condition of Spain, and whatever con
sideration the United States may show must
come from its sense of generosity and benevo
lence, rather than from any real or technical
obligation."
Again, on November 13, I instructed the com
mission:
"Our aim In the adjustment of peace should
be directed to lasting results and to the
achievement of the common good under the
demands of civilization, rather than to am
bitious designs. â¢ â¢ â¢
ing settlement as it was Just and humane i
its original action. â¢ â¢ â¢
"It is my wish that throughout the negotia
tions entrusted to the Commission, the pur
pose and spirit with which the United States
accepted the' unwelcome necessity of war
should be kept constantly In view. We took
up arms only in obedienge to the dictates of
humanity and in the fulfillment of high public
and moral obligations. We had no design of
Aggrandizement and no ambition of conquest.
Through the long course of repeated represen
tations which preceded and aimed to avert the
struggle and In the final arbitrament of force
this country that compelled solely by th<Â»
purpose of relieving grievous wrongs and re
moving long existing conditions which dio
turbed the tranquillity, which shocked the
moral sense of mankind and which could no
longer be endured. It Is my earnest wish that
the United States In making peace should rol
low the same high rule of conduct wfclch
iruided It^in facing war. It should be a.s
scrupulous and magnanimous In the conclud-
Following these brilliant victories.' on 'the
12th of .August. 1R9S, upon the initjative of
Spain, hostilities were suspended and a proto
col was signed with a view to arranging terms
of peace between the two governments. In
pursuance thereof, I appointed as commission
ers the following distinguished citizens to con
duct the negotiations on the part of the United
States: Tho Hen. William R. Day of Ohio th.Â»
Hon. William P. Frye of Maine, the Hon*
Cushman K. Pavls of Minnesota, the Hon
George Gray of Delaware and the Hon. White
law Rled of New York.
In addressing the Peace Commission before
Its departure for Paris, I said:
The Peace Commission.
It will be seen that the Government
has been used for the liberty, the
peace and the prosperity of the Phil
ippine peoples, and the force has
been employed only against force
which stood In the way of the reali
zation of these ends.
On the 2ith day of April. 1S9S, Congress de
clared that a state or war existed between
Spain and tho United States. On May 1, 1SUS,
Admiral Dewey destroyed the Spnnlsh fleet in
Manila Bay. On May 19, 1898, Major Genera!
Merrltt. U. S. A., was placed In command of
the military expedition to Manila and direct
ed among other things to immediately "pub
lish a proclamation declaring that we comt
not to make war upon the people of the Phil
ippines nor upon any part or faction among
them, but to protect them In their homes, in
their employments and In their personaJ and
religious rights. All persons who, .either by
active aid or by honest submission, co-operate
with the United States in its efforts to givo
effect to this beneficent purpose will receive
the reward of Its support and protection "
On July 3. 1S9S, the Spanish fleet in attempt-
Ing to escape from Santiago harbor was de
stroyed by the American fleet and on July IS,
1898, the Spanish garrison in the city of Santi
ago surrendered to the commander of the
American furces.
For the sake of full and intelligent under
standing of the Philippines question and to
give to the public authentic Information of the
acts and alms of the administration, I present
at some length the events of importance lead
ing up to the present situation. The purposes
of the Executive are best revealed and can best
be Judged by what he has done and is doing.
The Philippines.
January 1, 1000. We have restored Â«-der and
established domestic tranquillty. We*have fed
the starving, clothed the naked and ministered
to the sick. We have Improved the sanitary
condition of the island. We have stimulated
Industry, Introduced public education and
taken a full and comprehensive enumeration of
the inhabitants. The qualification of electors
has been settled and under It officers have been
chosen for all the municipalities in Cuba.
These local governments are now in operation,
administered by the people. Our military es
tablUhment has been reduce.! from 43,000 sol
diers to less than 6000. An electltfn has been
ordered to be held on the 15th of September
under a fair election law already tried in the
municipal elections to choose members of a
constitutional convention, and the convention
by the same order Is to assemble on the first
Monday of November to frame a constitution
upon which an Independent government for the
Island will rest. All this Is a long step in the
fulfillment of our sacred guarantees to the peo
ple of Cuba.
We hold Porto Rico by the same title as the
Philippines. The treaty of peace which ceded
us the one conveyed to us the other. Congress
has given to this Island a government In which
the Inhabitants participate, elect their own
Legislature, enact their own local laws, pro
vide their own system or taxation and in
these respects have the same power and priv
ileges enjoyed by other Territories belonging
to the United States nnd a much larger, meas
ure of self-gnvernmem than was given to the
Inhabitants of Louisiana under Jefferson. A
IMstrlct Court cf the United States for Porto
Hico has been established and local courts have
been inaugurated, all of whlcn are in opera
tion. The generous treatment of the Porto
Kicans accords with the most liberal thought
of our own country and encourages the best
aspirations of the people of the island. While
they do nut have instant free commercial In
tercourse with the T'nited States, Congress
complied with my recommendation by remov
ing on the first clay of May mst, 85 per cent of
the duties and providing forahe removal of the
remaining IS per cent on the first of March.
1M2 or earlier, if the legislature of Porto Kico
shall provide local revenues for the expenses of
conducting the government. During this inter
mediate period Porto Rican products coming
into the United States pay their tariff of 15 per
cent of the rates under the Pingley act and
our goods, going to Porto Itlco pay a like rate.
The duties thus paid and collected, both In
Porto Rico and the United States, are paid to
the government of Porto Rico and no part
thereof is taken by the national Government.
All of the duties from November 1. 1SSS. to
June 30, 1900, aggregating the sum of $2,250.
&23 21. raid at the customs houses In the
United States upon Porto Rlcan products, un
der the laws existing prior to the above men
tioned act of Congress, have gone Into the
treasury of Porto Itico to relieve the destitute
and for schools and other public purposes. In
addition to this wo have expended for relief,
education and Improvement of roads, the sum
of H.613.084.95. The United States military
force In the Island has beVn reduced from
ll.ooo to 15Cn, and native Porto Rlcans consti
tute for the most part the Wat constabulary.
Under the new law, and the Inauguration of
the rlvii government, there has been a grati
fying revival of business. The manufactures
of Porto Rico are developing: her Imports are
increasing; her tariff is yielding increased re
turns; her fields are being cultivated; free
schools are being established. Notwithstand
ing the many embarrassments incident to a
change of national conditions, she is rapidly
showing the good effects of her new relations
to this nation.

now left of those who fought Jn the Mexican
war and while many of the veterans of thÂ«
Civil v.ar are still spared to us, their num
bers are rapidly diminishing and age and in
firmity are Increasing their dependence. TheÂ«e
with the soldiers of the Spanish war will not
be neglected by their grateful countrymen The
pension laws have been liberal. They should
be justly administered" and will be. Prefer
ences should be given to the soldiers, sailors
and marines, their widows and orphans with
respect to employment In the public service.
For labor a short day is better than
a short dollar; one will lighten the
burdens, the other lessen the rewards
of toil. The one will promote con
tentment and independence, the
other penury and want. The wages
of labor should be adequate to keep
the home in comfort, educate the chil
dren, and, with thrift and economy,
lay something by for the days of in
firmity and old age.
Practical civil service reform has always had
the support and encouragement of the Repub
lican party. Ttie future of the merit system is
safe In its hands.
During the present administration, as occa-
Bions have arisen for modification or amend
ment in the existing civil service law and rules,
they have bem made. Important amendments
were promulgated hy executive order under
date of May 29. 1809, having for their principal
purpose the exemption from competitive exami
nation of certain places Involving fiduciary re
sponsibilities or duties. of a strictly confidential,
scientific or executive character, which might
better be filled either. by non-comrietitlve ex
amination or by other tests of. fitness in the
discretion of the appointing officer. It Is grati
fying that the experience of more than a year
has vindicated these changes, in the marked
Improvement oi the public service. The merit
system, as far as practicable, iR made the basis
for appointments to office In our new terri
tory. - .
Combinations of capital which con
trol the market in commodities neces
sary to the general use of the peo
ple by suppressing natural and or
dinary competition, thus . enhancing
prices to the general consumer, are
obnoxious to the common law and the
public welfare. They are dangerous
conspiracies against the public good
and should be made the subject for
prohibitory or penal legislation.
Publicity will be a helpful influence to check
this evil. This uniformity of legislation in the
eeveral States should be secured. Discrimina
tion between what is injurious and what is use
ful and necessary in business operations iÂ« es
sential to the wise and effective treatment of
this subject. Honest co-operation of capital is
necessary to moot new business conditions and
extend our rapidly Increasing foreign trade, but
conspiracies and combinations in
tended to restrict business, create
monopolies and control prices should
be effectually restrained.
The best service which can be rendered to
labor is to afford It an opportunity for steady
and remunerative employment and give it every
encouragement for advancement. The policy
that subserves this end is the true American
policy. The past three years have been more
satisfactory to American workmen than many
preceding years. Any change of the present In
dustrial or financial policy of the Government
would be disastrous to their highest Interests.
With prosperity at home and an Increasing
foreign market for American products employ
ment shnuld continue to wait upon labor, and,
with the present gold standard, the working
man is secured against payments for hla labor
In a depreciated currency.
A subject of immediate importance to our
country is the completion of a great waterway
of commerce between the Atlantic and Pa
cific. The const ruct Ion of a maritime, canal
Is row more than ever indispensable to that
intimate and ready communication between our
Eastern and Western seaports demanded by the
annexation of the Hawaiian Island* and the
expansion of our Influence and trade in the
Pacific.
Our national policy more Imperatively than
ever calls for its completion and control by this
Government, and it Is believed that the next
session of Congress, after receiving the full
report of the commission appointed under the
act approved March 3. 1SÂ»9. will make provisions
for the sure accomplishment of this great work.
Need of the Nicaragua Canal.
have called the attention of Congress to this
subject in my several annual messages. In that
of December 6, 1S97. I said:
"Most desirable from every standpoint of na
tional Interest and patriotism is the effort to
extend our foreign commerce. To this end
our merchant marine should be improved and
enlarged. We should do our full share of the
carrying trade of the world. We do not do
It now. We should be the laggard no longer."
In my message of December 5, 1S39, I said:
"Our national development will be one-sided
and unsatisfactory so long as the remarkable
growth of our inland industries remains unac
companied by progress on the seas. There is no
lack of constitutional authority for legislation
which 6hall give to the country maritime
strength commensurate with its Industrial
achievements and with Its rank among the np
tions of the earth. The past record has re
corded exceptional activity in our shipyards
and the promises of continual prosperity In
shipbuilding are abundant. Advanced legisla
tion for the protection of our seamen has been
enacted. Our coast trarie under regulations
wisely framed at the beginning of the Govern
ment and since shows results for the past tlscal
year unequaled In our records or those of any
power. We sha.ll fall to realize our opportuni
ties, however. If we complacently regard only
matters at home and blind ourselves to the
necessity of securing our phare in the valuable
carrying trade of the world."

PRESIDENT WILLIAM McKINLEY.

Orgrejs at its next session should reduce taxa

Five years ago we were selling Government
bonds bcarin? ns hlch as R per cent interest.
Now we are redeemir.R them with a bond nt
par bearing 2 per cent interest. We are selllnf?
our surplus of products and lending our surplus
money to Eurr.r>e. One result of our selling
to ether nations so much more, than we have
bought from them during the. past three years
Is a radical Improvement of our financial re
lations. The great amounts of capital which
havÂ« been borrowed of Europe for our Â¦ rapid,
material development have remained a constant
drain upon our resources for Interest and div
ilends and made our money markets liable to
constant disturbances by calls for payment or
heavy *ales of our securities whenever money
sirir-eency or panic occurred abroad. We havÂ«
now been paying these debts and bringing home
many of our securities and establishing counter
vailing credits abroad by our loans and plac
ing ourselves upon a sure foundation of finan
cial independence.
In the unfortunate contest between Great
Britain and the Iloer States of South Africa the
United States has maintained an attitude of
neutrality in accordance with Its well-known
traditional policy. It did not hesitate, how
ever, when requested by the Governments of
the. R*ith African republics to exercise Us good
offices for a cessation of hostilities. It in to
be observed that while the South African repub
lic? made a like request of other powers, the
I'nlted States is the only one which complied.
The IJritish Government declined to accept the
intervention of any power.
Ninety-one per cent of our exports and Im
ports are now carried by foreign shirs. For
ocean transportation we pay annually to for
eijrn shipowners over $103,000,000. We ougtit

the world and we ought to bulid them In Amer

The Republican party remains faithful to Its
principle of tariff, which supplies sufficient rev
enue for the Government and adequate protec

fruits of American labor and furnishes new

The present Onnjrress has Riven to Alaska a

revived the free homestead policy.
In Us great financial law it provided for the

of Â£5.000 for the b.-nefit of villages and rural
communities, and brinpin^ the opportunity for
profitable buslnesa in bnnkln* within the reach

Our industrial and agricultural
conditions are more promising than
they have been for many years; prob
ably more so than they have ever
been. Prosperity abounds everywhere
throughout the republic.
I rejoice that the Southern as well as the
Northern Â£taua are enjoylntt a full share of
these Unproved national conditions and that
ail are contributing so largely to our remark
able industrial development. The money lender
receives lower rewards for his capital than if it
wÂ«-re invested in active business. The rates of
interest are lower than they have ever been
in this country, while those thing* which are .
produced on the farm and In the workshops,
and the labor producing them, have increased
in value.
Our Foreign Trade.
Our foreign trade shows a satisfactory and
Increasing growth. The amount of our exports
for the year V.'i") over those of the exceptionally
prosperous year of 1W*, was about $*>iÂ»,000 for
every <lay of the year, and these sums have
rone Into the homes and enterprises of the
:-eÂ£;.le. There has been an increase, of over
130,009,000 ir. the exports of agricultural pro
ducts; t92.692.220 in manufactures and in the
products of the mines over $lo,00<t.<M). Our
trade balances cannot fall to Kive satisfaction
tr. ihe peoT'le of tho country. In 1Â»S we sold
abroad $fil."i.4:{2.6T8 of products more than we
bought abroa-l; in 18Â», $:.2M74,xi3, and in 1303
$544,471,701. making durinK the thn-e years a to

Four hundred and thirty-six million dollars
of eold have been ndded to the roM stock 'of
the United States since. July 1. ISSfi. The law
of March 14. Ij'KI, authorized the refunding in
2 p*r cent bonds of that part of the public debt
represented by the 3 per cents due in 1908, the
4 per cents due In 1?T7, and the 5 per cents due
In I&"t4, apKrecating JMVX'O.OOO. More than one

In excess of Its rxoendltures.
While our receipts both from customs and In

WASHINGTON, Sept. 9.â William McKinley's
letter, accepting a Republican renomination
for the Presidency, which was made public to
night, will be the ]>oliiical text book of the Re
publicans in the present campaign. Placing
the monetary issue first, the President shows that the financial
and industrial interests of the United States would be as much
endangered by the election of Bryan this year as they would
have been had he been elected in 1896. Mr. McKinley reviews
with satisfaction the record of the Republican party during the
last four years and then takes up the issue of "imperialism,"
which the Democrats have declared to be paramount. His an
swer to the Democratic charges is a review of the action of the
administration and Congress regarding Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines, concluding with the declaration:
"The American question is between duty and desertion. The
American verdict will be for duty and against desertion â for the
republic against both anarchy and imperialism."
Following is the full text of the letter:

froi-a;. I';.on the grtat lFfue of the la^t na

pian.iftrd sni Indorses :he legislation of the
rrf-sent Congress by whi.l; that standard ' hes
t>f-en officially Â«rengihen *â¢!â¢ The stability ot
Â©ur national currency is therefore secure fo
t<r.r as those who ailher^ to the platform are
f-vt In control of the Government. In the
ftryt battle, that of UK, the- friends of the gold
e?ar.<1srd and of sound currency were triumph
ant ar.<5 the cour.t-y is rnjoyir.g the fruits oÂ»
that victory. Our antagonists, however, are
not satisfied.
They compel us to a second battle
upon the same lines on which the
first -was fought and von. While re
gretting the recpening of this ques
tion, Â¦which can only disturb the pres
ent satisfactory financial condition of
the Govcrnmejit and visit uncertainty
upon our great business enterprise,
we accept the issue and again invits
the sound noney forces to join in
winning another, and, we hope, a
permanent triumph for an honest
financial system, which Â¦will continue
inviolable in the public faith.
Af 'n lKif> the three silver parties are united,
un* r the same leader who, immediately after
the ele<T]on of that year !n a,n address to the
tdmetaHiata, paid:
"The friends of blmetalllFm have not been
verxjulFfced : they have pimply been overcome.
They believe that the gold standard In a con
spiracy of the money chanjrers against the
vrlfare of the human race and they will con
tinue the warfare against it."
The Real Issue.
The po'lr-y tbm proclaimed has been Rccepted
and confirmed by these parties. The Silver
I>emo<-ratic platform of 1!**' continues the wm
iÂ«rÂ» apainst the so-oallfii gold conspiracy when
It expreFF'.y nays: "We reiterate the demand of
that (the Chlcapol platform of 1S50 for an

nation."
Po the lfsue If presented. It -will be noted
that the demand 1* for the immediate restora
tion of the free coinage of Fllver at If to 1. If
â¢mother issue is paramount, thin is immediate.
It will admit of no delay and will euffer no
postponement.

find in the Populist national platform, adopt

"We plÂ«-dxe anew the People's party nÂ«ver

The platform of the Silver party adopted at
Kansac <'lty. July 6, 1500, makes the following
announcement:
"We declare It to be our Intention to lend
Â«iur efforts to the repeal of this currency law.
which not only repudiates the ancient and
time-honored principles of the American people
J-fore the constitution vu adopted, but Ik vio-
Jative of the principles of the con6titution

there has Vwen eFtablished in Its place a mon

that their effort* shall be unceasing until the

and the free anfl unlimited coinage of silver at

not pissible that these parties /would treat the

which If demanded by their t"Â»veral platforms,
as void and inoperative in the event; that they
should be clothed with pcrwer. Otherwise their
l.no'eKfiaa of faith Is insincere. It Is, there

to Itiie financial heresy to prevent the triumph
of the parties whose union is only assured by
adherence to th* silver if sue. Will the Amer

Tbe Chicago platform of 1S9Â« Is reaffirmed In

On the 6th of February. 1W. the treaty was
ratified by the Senate of the Unlterl states
and the Congress immediately appropriated $20.

Efforts to Restore Peace.
As early as April. 1"<D3. the Philippine Com
mission, of which Dr. fYhurmann wan presi
dent, endeavored to brir.g about peace In the |
Islands by related conferences with leading i
Tagalogs, representing th* so-called Insurgent
government, to the enl that KimÂ» general plan
of government might be offered them which
they could accept- So grtÂ»at was the satisfac- j
tlon of the Insurgent comrrl?slTncra with the i
form of government proposed by the Ameri- !
can Commisslrners thnt the latter submitted
the proposed scheme to me for approval and
my action thereon is sho-wn by the cable mess
age following:
"May 5, 18Â».â BCHTJRMANN, MANILA:
Tours 4th received. You are authorized to pro- j
pose that under the military power of the Pres- !
ident, pending action of Congress, government '
of the Philippine Islands shall consist of a
Governor General, anointed liy the President; i
Cabinet, appointed by the Governor General: h ;
General Advisory Council elected by the people; I
the qualifications of electors to be carefully
considered and determined and the 'Governor
General to hÂ»ve absolute veto. Jurliciarry
strong and Independent: principal judces ap- i
pointed by the President. The Cabinet an.l ;
Judges to he chosen from natives or Americans, j
or both, having regard to fitness. The Presi- i
dent earnestly desires the cessation of blootl- j
shed, and that the people of the Philippine
Islands at an early date shall have the largest j
measure of local self-government consistent :
with peace and irood order."
In the latter nart of May another group of '.
representatives e<tme from the Insurgent leader, j
The whole matter was fully discussed, when j
the promise of acceptance seemed near at hana.
They assured our Commissoiners they would I
return after consulting with thÂ«-ir leader, but }
they never did.
As ft result of the views expressed by the |
first Tagalog representative favorable to the !
plan of the commission, it appears that he was.
by military order of the Insurgent leader, strip
ped of his shoulder straps, dismissed from the
army and sentenced to twelve years" Imprison
ment.
The views of the Commissioners are best set
forth In tholr own words:
"Deplorable as war is. the one In which we
are now engaged was unavoidable by us. We
were attacked by a bold, adventurous and en- j
thusiaFtie army. No alternative was left to
us except Ignominious retreat. It is not to be I
conceived that any American would have sane- !
tlontd the surrender of Manila to the Insur
gents. Our obligations to other nations, and
to the friendly Filipinos and to ourselves and
our flag demanded that force should be met by
force. Whatever the future of the Philippines
may be, there Is no course open to us now ex
cept the .iresecutlon of the war until the in
surgents are reduced to submission. The com
mission is of the opinion that there has been
no time since the destruction of the Sp&nlsri
squadron by Admiral Dewey when It was pos
sible to withdraw our forces from the islands
either with honor to ourselves or with safety
to t,he inhabitants."
Natives Not Yet Fit to Rule.
After the most thorough study of the peo
ples of the archipelago, the commission report
ed, among other things:
"Their lack of education and political expe
rience, combined with their racial and linguist
diversities, dtsaualify them In spite of their
mental gifts and domestic virtues to undertake
the frovernins of the archipelago at the pres
ent time. The most that can be expected of
them is to co-operate with thÂ» Americans In
the administration of general affairs from Ma
nila as a center, and to undertake, subject to
American control or guidance <as may be
found necessary), the administration of pro
vincial and municipal affairs. â¢ â¢ â¢
"Should our rower by any fatality be with
drawn, the commission believes that the Gov
ernment of the Philippines would speedily lapse j
Into anarchy, which would excuse If It did not >
necessitate the Intervention of the other powers I
and the eventual division of the Islands among
them. Only through American occupation,
therefore. Is the Idea of a free, self-governing
and united Philippine commonwealth at all
conceivable. â¢ â¢ â¢
"Thus the welfare of the Filipinos coincides
with the dictates of national honor In forbid- I
ding our abandonment of the archipelago. We j
cannot from any point of view escape the re- j
sponsion itles of government which our sover
eignty entails; and the commission Is strongly
persuaded that the performance of our national
duty will prove the greatest blessing to the
peoples of the Philippine Islands."
Satisfied that nothing further could be ac
complished in pursuance" of their mission urt'l
the rebellion was supr wswd, and desiring to
place before the rnnÂ«rrÂ»sÂ» the rÂ»*i!lt of their
ibservations. I r.-ouev-i th- commission to

work I know nothing of them and 1 don't
think it has come to the knowledge of the
board members. It would be very bad
policy for the national officers of the Mine
Workers to ask the intercession of any
political party and this must eectainly not
be done. We are trying to get for the
miners of our organization and those not
affiliated with us honest wages."
As soon as he arrived at his office this
morning President Mitchell sent word to
the telegraph offices instructing that if
any messages had been received for him
during the night that they be delivered at
once to his office. After waiting for a
reasonable time for a response the board
was called to order. No messages came
and this Is taken as an indication that
negotiations are still pending. Up to the
time the members of the board left the
office of the president there had been no
communications with the leaders in the
anthracite districts.
Summed up. the situation, according to
the admission of I'resident Mitchell, is
simply this:
"Negotiations are undoubtedly on for o
settlement of the differences without o
strike So long as these are pending the
miners will not strike, for the reason that
the operators would be left a loophole of

by saying the men had gone out at a time
when there was a chance to arbitrate."

the national executive board of the United
Mine Workers, in session at Indianapolis,
in declining to declare a strike Involving

RICH STRIKE REPORTED IN

Tho captain of the Thomson reports that
several of the first tiaims located at
Nome are showing up well, it having
taken the entire season to place them in
working order.
Hefore the Thomson sailed from Nome
a report reached there that rich diggings
had been struck on Bluestone Creek this
side of Cape York and parties who came
down from Bluestone reported they had
found plenty of dust. This caused a stam
pede and all the small steamers and
schooners at Nome headed for the scene
of the new strike loaded with passengers,
while many started out in small boats.
It is said by the time the stampede is
over find the last steamer of the season

STAMPEDE FROM
NOME TO OTHER
RICHER FIELDS
The American people will not mako
the murderers of our soldiers tho
agents of the republic to convey the
blessings of liberty and order in the
Philippines. They will not make them
the builders of the new common
wealth. Such a course would be a be
trayal of our sacred obligations to the
peaceful' Filipinos and would place at
the mercy of dangerous adventurers
the lives and property of the natives
ard foreigners.
It would make possible and easy the com
mission of such atrocities nÂ« were secretly
planned to be executed on the 22d of Febru
ary, 1S99, In the city of Manila, w-hen only the
..^..â .-â¢ < -â¢ Ki-r army prevented the attempt
If that be not their purpose, then It should
be promptly disclaimed, for only evil can re
sult from the hopes raised by our opponents in
the minds of the Filipinos, that with their suc
cess nt the poi!a in November there will be a
withdrawal of our ?vmy and our American
sovereignty In the aro..;;>elago: the complete
independence of the Tagalog people recognized j
and the powers of government over ail other
peoples of the archipelago conferred upon the
Tagalog leaders.
The effect of a belief in the minds
of the insurgents that this will be
done has already prolonged their re
bellion and increases the necessity for
the continuance of a large army, is
now delaying the establishment of
peace and civil government in the
islands and has influenced many of
the insurgents against accepting the
liberal terms of amnesty offered by
General Macarthur under my direc
tion. But for these false hopes a con
siderable reduction could have been
had in our military establishment in
the Philippines and realization of a
stable government would be already
at hand.
The American people are asked by cur op
ponents to yield the sovereignty of the Islands
of the Philippines to a small fraction of the
populationâ a single tribe out of eighty or
more inhabiting the archipelago; a fraction
which wantonly attacked the American troopts
In Manila while in rightful possession under
the protocol with Spain, awaiting the latlflcA
tlon of the treaty of peace by the Senate, and
which has since been In active, open rebellion
against the United States. We are asked to
transfer our sovereignty to a small minority
In the islands without eonFUltlntr the majority
and abandoning the largest portion of the pop
ulation which has lx>en loyal to us to the cru
elties of the guerrilla Insurgent bands.
More than this, we are asked to protect this
minority In establishing a government and to
this end repress all opposition of the majority.
We are requested to set up a stable govern
ment In the Interest of those who have assailed
our sovereignty and fired on our soldiers, and
then to maintain it at any cost or sacrifice
aKftlnst Its enemies, and against those having
ambitious designs without.
This would require an army and navy far
larger than Is now rqnintalned in the Philip
pines and still more In excess of what will be
nweasary with the full recognition of our Â»ov
eretgnty. A military support of authority not
our own. as thus proposed, Is the very essence
of militarism which our opponents in their
platform oppose, but which by their policy
would of necessity be established in Its most
offensive form.
Would our opponents surrender to
the insurgents, abandon our sov
ereignty or cede it to them?
If so. thoy must be reminded that* It could
not have been ratified in the Senate but for
their assistance. The Senate which ratified the
treaty and the Congress which added its sanc
tion by a large appropriation, comprised Sen
ators and Representatives of the people of all
parties.
Are our opponents against the treaty?
Some Pertinent Questions.
It is our purpose to establish in
the Philippines a government suit
able to the wants and conditions of
the inhabitants and to prepare them
for sÂ°lf-geverrment and to give them
self-government when they are
ready for it, and as rapidly as they
are ready for it. That I am aiming
to do under my constitutional au
thority and will continue to do until
Congress shall determine the political
statusÂ«of the inhabitants of the archi
pelago.
We are in agreement with all of those who
sÂ«upi>orted the war with Spain and also with
those who counseled the ratification of the
treaty of peace. Upon these two great es
s'-ntial Ftc-ps there can be no issue and out of
these came all of our responsibility. If others
would shirk the obligations imposed by the
war and treaty, we must decline to act further
with thorn and here the Issue Is made.
With all the exaggerated phrase
making of this electoral contest we
are In danger of beingj diverted from
the real contention.
It has been asserted that there would have
been no fighting in the Philippines If Congress
hail declared Its purpose to give Independence
ta the Tapal insurgents. The insurgents did not
wait for the action of Congress. They assumed
the ofTenxlve: they opened fire on our army.
Those who asserted our responsibility for the
beginning of the conflict have forgotten that
before the treaty was ratified in the Senate,
and while it was bring debated in that body,
and while the Bacon resolution was under dis
cussion on February 4. 1S3S. the insurgents at
tacked the American army after being pre
viously advised that the American forces were
under orders not to open fire upon them, ex
cept In defense. The papers found In the re
cently captured archives of the insurgents dem
onstrate that this attack had been carefully
planned for weeks before it occurred. Their
unprovoked assault upon our Foldlers at a time
when the Senate was deliberating upon the
treaty shows that no action on our part except
the surrender and abandonment would have
prevented the fighting and leaves no doubt In
fair minds where the responsibility rests for
the shedding of American blood.
was not. So long as the sovereignty remains
In us it Is the duty of the executive, whoever
he may be. to uphold the sovereignty and If It
be attacked to suppress Its assailants.
Would our political adversaries do less?
Filipinos Began the War.
And was it not our duty to pro
tect the lives and property of those
who came within our control by the
fortunes of war? Could we have
come away at any time between May
1, 1898, and the conclusion of peace
without a stain upon our good name?
Could we have come away without
dishonor at any time after the ratifi
cation of the peace treaty by the Sen
ate of the United States?
There has been no time since the destruction
of the enemy's fleet when we could or should
have left the Philippine nrchlpelago. After the
treaty of peace was ratified nn r>owe r hut '""<
gress could surrender our sovereignty or alien
ate a foot of the territory thus acquired. Con
gress has not seen fit to do the one or the
other, and the President ha* no authority to .t.Â»
either. If he had been so Inclined, which he
promises whate\er. lie adds:
"He (Aguinaldo) asked me If my Government
was Roing to recoxnlz* his government. 1 an
swered that I was there elmply in a military
capacity: that I could not acknowledge his
government b/cause I had no authority to do
so." *-
Would not our adversaries have sent Dewey' s
fleet to Man'la to capture and destroy the
Spanish sea power thei-e. or.- dispatching It
there, would they have withdrawn It after the
obstruction of the Spanish fleet, and. if the
latter, whither would they have directed It to
Rail? Where could !t have gone? What port
in the Orient was open to it? Do our adver
saries condemn the expedition tinder the com
mand of <leneral Merritt to strengthen Dewey
over Spain, with which nation we were at war?
Was It net our highest duty to strike Spain at
every vulnerable point, that the war might
be successfully concluded at the earliest prac
ticable moment?
Fpanlsh prisoners. All these demands were
refused."
Corroborative Reports.
Generals Merritt. CJreen and Anderson, who
were In command at the beginning of our oc
rvpation and until the surrender of Manila,
state that thTe was no alliance with the in-
I Kurgents and no promise to them of lndepend-
I ence. On Augnst 17. lvjs. General Merritt was
lion of Manila with the Insurgents. General
Anderson, under date of February 10, 1900. says
that he was present at the interview between
Admiral DewÂ«y and the Insurgent leader and
that In thlK Interview- Admiral Dewey made no
motlon reach the head of the department. â¢ â¢ â¢
â¢'Forty-five miles of railroad extension under

rich In valuable minerals, with strictly tern- |
perate climate a mile hiph. Railroad construc
tion will give employment to many and com- ;
munication will furnish market to vast stretches
of rich agricultural latuis."
They report that there are "calls from all
parts of the island for public schools, school
eupplies and English teachers, greater than
the Commission can provide, until a compre
hensive school ?>ttÂ»Tn is organized. NlRht
schools for teaching EnpliFh to adults are being
established in response to popular demand. Na
tive children show aptitude in learning Eng
lish. Spanish is spoken by a. small fraction
of people and in a few years the medium of
communication in the courts, public offices and
between tribes will be Knglish. Creation of
central government within eighteen months, un
dT which substantially all rights described
in the bill of. rights in the Federal constitution
are to be secured to the pe i>le of the Philip
pine*, will bring to them contentment, prosper
ity, education and political enlightenment."
This shows to my countrymen
what has been and what is being
done to bring the benefits of liberty
and good government to these wards
of the nation.
Every effort has been directed to their peace
nnd prosperity, their advancement and well be
ing, not for aggrandlzement. nor for pride of
might, not for trade or commerce, not for ex
ploitation, but for humanity and civiliza
tion and for the protection of the
vast majority of the population
who welcome our sovereignty
against the designing minority
whose first demand after the surrender of Ma
nila by the Spanish nrroy was to enter the
city that they might loot it and destroy those
not in syn.pathy with their eelfish and treach
erous designs.
No Promises of Independence.
Nobody who will avail himself of the facts
will longer hold that there was any alliance
between our soldiers anil the insurgents or that
any promise of independence was made to them.
\jT\nz before a leader had reached Manila they
resolved, if the commander of the American
navy would give them armi= with which to fieht
the Fpanish army, they wouli later turn upon
us, which they did murderously and without
show of cause or Justification. There are those
without the means of full information who be
lieve that we were In alliance with the in
surgents, and that we assured them that they
should have Independence. To such let me re
peat the facts.
On the 18th of May, 1S9S, Admiral Dewey was
Instructed by me to make no alliance with any
party or faction in the Philippines that would
Incur liability to maintain their cause in the fu
ture and he replied under date of June 6, lSl'S:
"Have acted according to ppirlt of depart
ment's Instructions from the beginning and I
have entered into no alliance with the insur
gents or with any faction. This squadron can
reduce the defenses of Manila at any moment.
but it is considered useless until the arrival
of sufficient United States forces to retain pos
i session."
In the report of the first Philippine Commis
sion, submitted on November 2. 1S1'9, Admiral
Dewey, one of its members, said:
"No alliance of any kind was en
tered into with Aguinaldo nor was
any promise of independence made
to him at any time." i
General Merritt arrived in the Philippines
July Â£3. 1S9S. and a dispatch from Admiral
L'ewey to the Oovernment at Washington said:
"Merritt arrived yesterday. Situation Is must
critical at Manila. The Spanish may surrender
at any moment. Merritt's most difficult prob
i ltm will be how to dr-al with the insurgents
I under Aerulnaldo. who have become aggressive
I and even threatening toward our army."
Here is revealed the spirit of the insurgents
as early as July, 1S?\ before the protocol was
Ftgned, while we were Ftlll engaged In active
war with fpaln. ICven then the insurgents
were threatening our army. On August 13 Ma
nila was captured, and of this and subsequent
events the Philippine Commission says:
"When Manila was taken on August 13 the
Filipinos took no part In the attack, but came
following, with a view to looting the city,
and were only prevented from doing so l>y our
forces preventing them from entering. Aguin
eldo claimed he had the right to occupy the
city: he demanded of General Merritt the pal
are of Malacanan for himself and the cession
of all the churches of Manila, also that a part
of the money ta-ken from the Spaniards as
spoils of war should be given up, and. above
all. that he should be given the arms of the
If our opponents -would only prac

The Republican party does not have to assert
Its devotion to the Declaration of Independence.
That Immortal. Instrument of the fathers re
mained unexecuted until the people under the
lead of the Republican party In the awful clash
of battle turned its promises Into fulfillment.
It wrote into the constitution the amendments
guaranteeing ! political equality to American
citizens nnd It has neyer broken them or coun
eeled others In breaking them. It will not be
guided in Its conduct by one set of principles
at home and another set In the new territory
belonging to the United States.
There Is a strain of Ill-concealed hypocrisy in
the anxiety to-, extend the constitutional guar
nntees to the people of the Philippines while
their nullification Is openly advocated at homo.
Our opponents may distrust themselves, but
they hfiv! no right to discredit the
coo<l faith and patriotism of the ma
jority of the people who are opposed to them.
They may fear the worst form of im
perialism with the helpless Filipinos
in their hands, but if they do, it is
because they have parted with the
spirit and faith of the fathers and
have lost the virility of the founders
of the party which they profess to
represent.
Freedom is the rock upon which the
Republican party was builded and
now rests. Liberty is the great Re
publican doctrine for which the peo
ple went to war and for which a mil
lion lives were offered and billions of
dollars expended to make it the law
of the legacy of all, without the con
sent of the master or slave.
Those -who profess to distrust the liberal and
honorable purposes of the administration in its
treatment of the Philippines are not Justified.
Imperialism has no place in its creed or con
duct.
There were those who two years ago
were rushing us on to war with
Spain who are now unwilling to ac
cept its clear consequences, as there
are those among us who advocated
the ratification of the treaty of peace,
but now protest against its obliga
tions. Nations which go to war must
be prepared to accept its resultant ob
ligations, and when they make trea
ties must keep them.
What. then, is the real Issue on this sub
ject? Whether It is paramount to any other
or not. It Is whether we shall be responsible
for the government of the Philippines with the
sovereignty and authority which enables us to
guide them to reeulated liberty, law, safety
and progress, or whether we shall be responsi
ble for the forcible and arbitrary government
of a minority without sovereignty and au
thority on our part, and only the embarrass
ment of a protectorate, which draws us into
their troubles without the power of preventing
them.
The Real Issue.
Our title I* practically identical with that
under which we hold our' territory acquired
since the beginning of the government and
under which we have exercised full sovereignty
and established government for the Inhabi
tants. It Is worthy of note that no one out
side of the United States disputes the fullness
and intecrity of the cession.
If any who favored its ratification be
lieved it gaye us a bad title, they were not
sincere. ,
The Senate believed It was a good title when
it gave it their constitutional consent and the
Confiress seems not to have doubted Its com
pleteness when it appropriated ?20,000,000 pro
vided by the treaty.
The Executive believed It would be a good
title when he submitted it to the Senate of the
United States for its ratification.
Our Peace Commissioners believe they were
receiving a good title when they concluded the
treaty.
We -will not give up our own to
guarantee another sovereignty. Our
title is good.
Our rights In the Philippines are now free
from outside Interference and will continue so
In our present relations. They would not be
thus free in any other relation.
Besides, If we cannot establish any govern
ment of our own, without the consent of the
governed, as our opponents contend, then we
could not establish a stable government for
them or make ours a protectorate without a
like consent, and neither the majority of the
people nor the minority have Invited us to
assume It. We could not maintain a pro
tectorate even with the consent of the gov
erned without giving provocation for conflicts
and possibly costly wars.
Neither Congress nor the Executive can es
tablish a stable government In these islands,
except under our right of sovereignty under
our authority and our flap. This we are do
ing. We could not do it as a protectorate
power so completely or so successfully as we
are doing it now. As the sovereignty power
we can Initiate action and shape means to
ends, and guide the Filipinos to self-develop
ment and self-government. Ab a protectorate
power, we could not initiate action but would
be compelled to follow and uphold a people
with no capacity yet to go alone. In the one
case we can prevent both ourselves and the Fil
ipino? from being Involved in dangerous com
plications; In the other we could not protect
even the Filipinos until after their trouble had
come.
No Government can so certainly
preserve the peace, restore the public
order and establish law, justice and
stable conditions as ours.
In short, the proposition of those opposed
to us is to continue all the obligations in the
Philippines which now rest upon the Govern
ment, only changing the relation from the
principle which now exists to that of surety.
Our responsibility is to remain, but our power
Is to be diminished. Our obligation is to be of
no less, but our title Is to be surrendered to
another power which is without experience or
training or the ability to maintain *u stable
government at home and absolutely helpless to
perform its International obligations with the
rest of the world. To this we are opposed.
We should not yield our title while our obli
gations last. In the language of our platform.
"Our authority should not be less than our
responsibility," and our "responsibility is to
establish our authority In all islands."
Plans of Opponents.
to assassinate our soldiers and all foreigners,
and to pillage and destroy Its surroundings.

The nation faces the new century
gratefully and hopefully, with in
creasing love of country, with firm
faith in its free institutions, and witJi
high resolve that they "shall not per
ish from the earth."
Very respectfully yours,
WILLIAM McKINLEY.
Relief of Peking.
The nation Is filled with gratitude that the
little band, among them many ot our own blood,
who for two months have been subjected to pri
vation and peril by attack of pitiless hordes at
the Chinese capital, exhibiting supreme courage
In the face of despair, have been enabled by
God's favor to greet their rescuers and find
shelter under their own flag.
The people, not alone pf this land liut of oil
lands, have been watched and prayed through
the terrible stress and protracted agony ot"
the helpless sufferers in Peking, and while at
times dark tidings seemed to make all hop- 1
vain, the rescuers never faltered In the heroic
fulfillment of their noble task. We are grate
ful to our own soldiers and sailors and marines,
and to all the brave men who. thouKh assem
bled under many standards, representing the
peoples and races of strangers In country and
speech, were yet united in the sacred mission
of carrying succor to the besieged, with a suc
cess that is now the cause of a world's re-
Joicine.
Not only have we reason for thanksfrivlngr for
our material blessings, but we should rejoice
in the complete unification of the people of all
sections of our country that has so happily de
veloped In the last few years and made for us
a far more perfect union. The obliteration of
oM differences, the common devotion to the
flae and the common sacrifices for Its honor,
so conspicuously shown by the men cf the
North and South in the Spanish war, have bo
strengthened the tics of friendship and mutual
respect that nothing- can ever again divide us.
The American question Is between duty and
desertionâ the American verdict will be for duty
and against desertion; for the republtc against
both anarchy and Imperialism.
The country has been fully advised of the
purposes ot the United States in China and they
will bÂ» faithfully adhered to as already defined.
Empire has been expelled from Porto Rico
and the Philippines by American freemen. The
flag of the republic now floats over these Islands
as an emblem of rightful sovereignty. Will
the republic stay and dispense to their inhab
itants the blessings of liberty, education and
free Institutions, or steal away, leaving them
to anarchy or Imperialism?

ence in any territory over which our

It Is reported that a strike will bÂ» order

turned toward the "West.
The operators, on the other hand regard
the postponement of the strike as mean
ing: that the leaders do not yet consider
the anthracite field strongly enough or
ganized to force them to grant demands
made by the recent Hazelton convention,
and unless a great change has occurred in
their attitude they will not arbitrate or
make any concessions, regardless of the
decision of the national board to hold off
and give more time for an adjustment of
the trouble.
open for bringing about a iettleznent

proposition.

SAN FRANCISCO. JjJMlltAHUJU Sundaysâ 9 to IIThe Democratic statesmen, who" traveled from all
parts of the. State to .the convention at San Jose and
found that their policy had already been outlined and
their actions dictated by the bosses, must have some
very emphatic opinions on the programme in politics.
The London Chronicle notes the arrival in that mar
ket of a large shipment of Australian oranges, but re
cords the fact that the sale was disappointing and at
tributes it to a prejudice against the fruit. The
chances arc, however, that the Londoners have by
this time learned to judge oranges by the California
standard and the Australians cannot come up to it.

CALIFORNIANS IN NEW YORK.
SENATOR FORAKER. in opening the Repub
lican campaign in Ohio, stated the whole truth
concerning the insincerity of the Bryanites in
attacking the Philippine policy of the adminstration
in language so terse it merits the attention of all
voters. "The paramount issue of the campaign,"
said the Senator, "is the administration of McKinley,
Shall it be indorsed or repudiated?" Then, com
menting upon what the Democrats call the paramount
issue, he added:
If President McKinley had pursued such a policy as
Mr. Bryan Is now proposing if elected, he would have
been branded as a weak betrayer of his trust and as
responsible for a great national humiliation. If you have
any doubt about this you have only to turn back to the
expressions of Democratic newspapers and Democratic
leaders at the time when our trouble in the Philippines
commenced, to learn that these men who are now talk
ing about hauling down the flag, giving the Filipinos
Independence and making peace on any terms, were then
more imperialistic and bloodthirsty and tyrannical, as
indicated by the advice they gave, than President Mc-
Kinley has ever been charged by them to be.
That statement contains nothing of the exaggera
tion of campaign oratory. It is the exact truth. Tiie
Call has repeatedly published extracts from the self
advertised Bryan organ on this coast, the Examiner,
showing that it actually did demand the adoption of a
â¢policy toward the Philippines "more imperialistic,
bloodthirsty and tryrannical" than any it has as yet
charged McKinley with, even in its most frant'ic mo
ments. â .
In fact, among the Bryanites arc many men who are
real imperialists. They suppress the negro vote in
the South and if they could would willingly suppress
the Republican vote everywhere. They are now sup
porting Bryan for the purpose of defeating McKinley
and getting control of the Government, but they mock
at Bryan's anti-expansion declarations and at the anti
imperial plank in the Kansas City platform. They
denounce McKinley as an imperialist because he up
holds the flag in the Philippines, but they would have
denounced him as a traitor had lie hauled it down.
In fact, the aim of the Bryanites is to drag down the
party of protection and the gold standard. They mas
querade as anti-imperialists solely to catch the votes
of the unwary to help them to that end. The para
mount issue then is the choice between prosperity or
calamity, for the election of Bryan would be a calamity
surpassing anything the republic has known since the
Civil War. Â¦>â¢;;;?;
THE PLAIN TRUTH CF IT.
Fred T. Jane, the well-known naval ex
pert, was on board one of the ships dur
ing the recent British naval maneuvers
as correspondent for a leading London
journal. His criticism of the defects of
the ships is sound in all .essential points
and the manner in which he talks to the
Admiralty for its apparent neglect is evi-
Two gun vessels in the French navy
just completedâ the Decidee and Zeleeâ
are 645 and 64G tons, respectively, and
nearly identical dimensions, the Zelee
drawing only 10 feet 6 inches against the
Decidee 12 feet 6 inches. They are both
fitted with Niclause boilers of 1000 horse
power, but their trials show a considera
ble difference in coal consumption with
the same horsepower. Thus the Zelee
under 335 horsepower consumed 1.25
pounds per horsepower, and during her
six hours' f ull speed developed 953 horse
power at an expenditure of 1.59 pounds.
The Decidee, with the same power, con
sumed 1.51 pounds and 1.S9 pounds, re
spectively. The consumption of either
vessel is in excess of tnat of the Ameri
can water-tube boiler used and being in?
stalled in the United States navy, and
also exceed the consumption of the coast
ing steamers here, notwithstanding the
fact that thÂ» coal used ia much inferior to
that supplied to ships of war.
A comparison of armaments of British
and German battleships shows that the
cost of the latter is nearly double that
of the British ships. The German battle
ships are about 11,800 tons and carry main
batteriesâ four 9.6-inch, eighteen 6-lnch
guns and six torpedo tubes at a total cost,
including the smaller guns, which are
about the same in number on both ships,
of $1,250,000. The British type is 15,000 tons
carries four 12-inch, twelve 6-inch and
four torpedo tubes at a cost of $630,000.
The main battery of the Oregon is com
posed of four 13-lnch, eight 8-inch, four
6-inch and two toroedo tubes and cost
$5S3,5D9, including the secondary battery,
and the Iowa's four 12-inch, eight 8-inch,
six 4-inch and four torpedo tubes are re
ported to have been Installed for $3S3.S59.
The extraordinary cost of the German
battery is susceptible to the explanation
that cheap labor is very expensive.
The British armored cruiser Hogue,
12,000 tons, 21,000 horsepower and 21 knots
speed, was launched August 13 at the yard
of Vickers' Sons & Maxim at Barrow-in-
Furness. The belt is of 6-inch Krupp steel
and her battery is composed of two 9.2
inch, twelve 6-inch and seventeen smaller
quick-firers./ The four boiler compart
ments, hdlcHns thirty Belleville boilers,
take in 130 feet of the length of the ship,
which is 440 feet. The vessel is wood
sheathed and* coppered, enabling her to

THE WORLD'S WARSHIPS
Two men recently lost their lives over
board the British battleship Uoliath in
the harbor of Hongkong t>Â»roush the
seeming neglect of the officers of -the ship.
Gunner MacNicoll, canteen server, went
down into the forward torpedo head
magazine to get up some stores. Another
gunner became unea3v at . iae><. coil's
long absence and finding the hatch closed
thought his mate had return;yi to the
deck. He made search for him and not
finding his man lifted up the hatch cover,
when he discovered MacNicoll lying at
the foot of the ladder. He called for as
sistance and four men, one after the oth
er, endeavored to set the me- out. but
three of them were overpowered by the
crrbonic acid gas in the hold. FInaily
Lieutenant Borland went down with a
bowline and a handkerchief over his
mouth and succeeded in getting a line
around one of the men and pulling him
up, and the other two were subsequently
hauled out. Two died and the third had
a close call. The accumulation of gas is
preventable if the regulations which pro
vide for tho opening and ventilation of
holds, bunkers and storerooms at stated
times are complied with. Explosions in
coal bunkers, as a rule, are c'ue to neg

looking after such matters in their routine

PERSONAL MENTION.
Jt looks as if Bryan were weakening on anti-im
perialism and has an idea of making it an anti-trust
right, so we may have an exhibition of John J. Valen
tine flipping another flop before election day and
explaining that Bryan doesn't mean it any more than
he means free silver.
The only point at which San Francisco got left this
year is that of neglecting to have the census taken this
week instead of last June.
BUSINESS R.EMARKABLY EVEN.
IT iÂ« rather unusual for trade to improve during a
Â¦ Presidential year, but it seems to be doing it this
* year, it commercial reports from different parts of
the country be correct. They note a cheerful tone
everywhere, with increasing distribution in several
H'ction?, and a marked recovery in the iron and steel
trade, in itself a goo i barometer of the condition of
business.
The bank clearings, however, show neither gain nor
loss. Week after week they exhibit the same unvary
ing decrease from la-t year of about 16 per cent. This
figure 10 seems to be stereotyped as the weekly re
sult of the nation's clearings. It is for the time
being a mystic and unvarying quantity, like the north
star. It shows what has already been remarked, that,
having got down to its proper level some months
igo. trade has not varied an iota since.
There is another curious feature about these weekly
clearing â the half (Imcn largest cities show a lo?s
every week, with hardly a br*eak. Thus, compared
with the vaine week in i^o/?. N r e* York la=t week lost
24 per cent, Boston 16.8 per cent. Chicago 1.5 per
cent. Philadelphia J5.4 per cent and St. Louis 4.2 per
cent. The nine next lnrgest cities pained. This ratio
ai-o i.- kept up week after week. Conditions seem fixed
.-â¢.li over the country. The ratio of failures likewise
ari'car~ stationary. th<;Â»e last week being 145. against
132 last year. All these figures illustrate the note
worthy stcadiv.er-s of tir.de. in spite of the Presidential
campaign. The reason lor this i* probably that the
great commercial and financial interests of the coun
try sre satisfied that the present administration will
not be changed by the election, for -if there is anv
thing abhorrent to trade it is a violent change.
Fluctuations in prices have been few and far be
tween duri'ijr the past month or so. As previously
observed, the iron and steel trade is in better shape
and most mills report large and increasing orders,
while October I is the date set for a peneraWeopen
iiiK of the mills now shut down. The shipyards of
the Pacific and the takes are reported full of ordes
for the next eight months. As against this improve
ment, however, there i* a falling off in the wool and
i)oot and shoe trades rr.d the other staples are gener
ally reported quiet and featureless, as usual at this
time of the year.
Wall street continues inactive, but the feel
ing in most stocks is steady. There i<= a rumor on
the street that England is again feeling toward Amer
ica for a loan and that ."ftcr the election she will agam
draw on this country for a few millions in gold coin
against a new issue of Uer bonds. If we keeo on this
way for two or three years more we .vill have prettv
much all Europe in our debt. Those snnguine finan
ciers who predicted a^ lew years ago that the United
States would soon be the world's banker were not so
far wroPT after all.
As far as local trade is concerned, there is little new
to report. In this city the current celebration has en
i:\cned things wonderfully and prices for some e->t-ihlo
have advanced accor.lmjj to the increase in the citv'
population. Downtown merchants report a ste-ui
demand for ail kinds of merchandise, both for local
and export account, jrd ships to carry away what we
sell to foreign countries are rather hard to find. It
was not many years go that owners of ships were
complaining of the extreme depression in their busi
ness. The canners report an active demand for
canned goods of all kinds â salmon, fruits, vegetables.
etc Country produce is generally steady in price and
only here and there a really dull line is found.
It is turning out a pretty good j'ear all around,
even if we are doing less business than in 1890. But
tnat. it must not be forgotten, was the year of the
great commercial boom.
TWO PROMISES OF SCIENCE.
nANY are the promises with which men of
science are now cheering the civilized world.
They hold before us the prospect of vastly in
creased power over the forces of nature and awakeu
the hope that within a time comparatively short we
may be able to accomplish with little machinery the
work which now entails such costly plants, as to give
capital an extraordinary advantage in industrial com
petition. Most of there promises are vague, the good
they may yield is indefinite and their realization is
seemingly far off. Two. however, recently put for
ward are apparently attainable within a few years and
their character is such the probable benefits can bo
calculated now.
One of the two comes from .England and was made
at the meeting on Saturday of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science. The dispatch in
reporting it said: "Sir William Henry Preece,. con
sulting engineer to the British PoVtoffice, made the
interesting announcement that as a result of his ex
periments with wireless telegraphy he had found it
quite possible to convey audible speeches six to eight
miles across the sea without wires. He added that it
was a practical commercial system and might be ex
tended to communicate bet\^-en ships and between
ships and the shore."
The other comes from Nikola Tesla. who claims to
have invented a method of insulating wires, which will
put an end to the present methods of transmitting
electrical currents and substitute new methods, which
will remove all danger of death from live wires and
also greatly reduce the loss of electricity in transmis
sion. The new insulation is to be by cold air. A corre
spondent of the London Telegraph reports that in an
interview on the subject Tesla said:
Before my cold-air insulation can be used the wires
will be placed under jrround. Sawdust and water are
likely to prove the most effective materials â to be placed
in a trough extending if desired a,cross the continent
A thin metal tube, capable of resisting a pressure of
200 pounds to the square inch, will be used for the pur
pose of transmitting- the current long- distances. The
trouch would be buried five or six feet below the sur
face, and, through a pipe submerged in the substance
intended to be frozen, will then be forced t. current of
gas. probably hydropen. reduced to a temperature of
minus 200 deprees, which will suffice to freeze the ma
terial and neutralize the heat generated by the elec
tricity. Assuming the invention, it gives to the world an
almost perfect insulator of gigantic value. Apparently
no electricity will be wasted in transmission. The cost
of the new insulation Is less than that of the present
method, hence the. invention is indispensable to telephone
and telegraph companies. Water-power* converted into
electricity can be carried thousands of miles. I f m d
Niagara's power can be brought to New York with a
loss of not more than a half to one per cent. For the
first time power will be used for insulation instead of
property. Most important changes in the industrial and
electrical world are bound to result.
Apparently neither of these two promises of ad
vanced power is any more improbable of fulfillment
than was the promise of wireless telegraphy as short
a time r.s two years ago. Wireless telegraphy has be
come a power of practical use in every civilized coun
try and it is therefore reasonable to assume that wire
less telephoning may not be" hopeless of speedv

from the tongues of the select. But it
is not likely that the famous home will
long shelter the three beauties. The Goad
house is for sale. Kighty thousand dol
lars is what the Goad heirs a.sk for It.
It's a pretty stiff price, but the large and
commodious house, with its wealth of
art treasures and magnificent grounds
is well worth it.
Â» â¢ . *
Speaking of houses, reminds that dear
Mrs. Murphy, after an awful two weeks
of house hunting, has taken the Galpln
house, on Broadway, near Gough street.
Mrs. Murphy is too sad for words at the
dreadful turn of luck that compels her
to give up the lovely home out on Pierce
street that she and her dainty daughter,
Addie, have been occupying for fully a
year. But it could not be helped. The
Welches, who built the house and then
went abroad with the intention of belnK
gone ever so long, returned unexpectedly,
and, of course, wanted their home back.
When the Welches went abroad it was
with the expectation that Mr. Welch
might absent himself permanently, and
that the other members of the firm (Cun
ninjfham, Curtis & Welch) to which he
belonged would free him from the busi
ness cares of the concern. But there
was sickness in the firm, and Welch had
to come home and do his share of the
work.
Mrs. Murphy has only taken the Galpln
home for a very phnrt time. Mr. Murphy,
who is in Paris at present, writes his
family that he believes he will retire from
an active business life, and if the bank
president really carries out his oft-re
peated threat we will have to "shake a
da-da" to the S. G. Murphys, as they
would then mane their home in Paris.
The McMurrays have sold their home
on Pacific avenue to Heynemann, the
wealthy tobacco man who some years ago
built for his own use the present H. K.
Huntington residence, out on Jackson
street, and after having completely fin
ished and furnished it, down to the
stocking of the linen closet, sold it to the
nephew of the late railroad magnate.
It is just too funny how the everybody
\A ORE things are in the Kansas City platform
/ \ than Bryan talks about and some of those
things are very important indeed. Already
many of the eminent leaders of the country have be
gun to point out that among the overlooked planks
are some whose declarations are even more threaten
ing than the bogey of imperialism, even were that as
bad as Bryan depicts it. Ex-Senator Edmunds, for
example, holds that the attack upon the Supreme
Court is one of the most vicious outbreaks of par
tisan madness that has ever been committed in Amer
ican politics and ought to determine even the most
zealous anti-expansionist to vote against the candidate
who represents it.
In a recent interview on the subject Edmunds
quoted the speech which David Bennett Hill made
against that plank of the Chicago platform when it
was under consideration by the convention and
pointed out that the issue is as menacing now as then.
In his protest against the platform Hill said:
"Was it wise to assail the Supreme Court of your
country? Will some one tell me what that clause means
in this platform? If you meant what you raid and said
what you meant? Let some one explain that provision.
That provision, if it means anything, means that it is the
duty of Congress to reconstruct the Supreme Court of
the country. It means the adding of additional members
to that court, or putting some out of office, or recon
structing- the whole court. I will not follow any such
revolutionary step as that.
That plank as well as every other of the Chicago
platform, was reaffirmed in the Kansas City platform.
Bryan, who supported it in 1896, has not expressed
any change of sentiment on the question. Now as
then, the independence of the Supreme Court is
menaced by the Bryanites and men like Senator Ed
munds, who know the supreme value of law, regard
the attack upon the highest tribunal of the republic
as the most dangerous movement which the agitators
of the time have directed against the existing order
of things.
Along with the attack upon the Supreme Court
goes the attack upon the financial integrity of the
nation. On that issue M. E. Ingalls. president of the
Big Four Railway system and a lifelong Democrat,
says:
The safety of the American republic is not menaced
by a bogey, crowned with an imperial diadem of straw.
The cry of imperialism is simply a pretext of the Demo
cratic loaders. Now, as in 1S96, the real issue is the
silver danger. The only peril now threatening the United
States is ruin and retrogression under silver, the turning
back of the wheels of progress and prosperity to the
standards of China and Mexico, and the abandonment
of our position as the greatest country in the civilized
world.
Then from the South itself come men who refuse
to accept anti-imperialism as the chief issue of the
time. Judge Hunt, who organized and led the free
silver movement in Georgia and gave the vote of that
State to Bryan in the Chicago convention, has re/used
to accept the new issue. In a recent letter to the
Atlanta Constituion he says:
The policy of this Government in dealing with its new
dependency is the outcome of the treaty of Paris. That
treaty is the law of the land, and to enforce that law
is the duty of the American people, regardless of party.
Opposition to it now means nothing less than discredit
to American honor and encouragement of resistance of
American effort to restore order and establish law in
legally acquired territory â territory acquired by treaty
the ratification of which Mr. Uryan went out of his way
to advise.
Thus from different parts of the country come pro
tests against the attempt to cover and hide from sight
the whole Kansas City platform except one plank.
The intelligence of the people will not submit to be
thus hoodwinked. There are more things in Bryan
ism than a protest against expansion, and the voters
know it.

achievement. The Tesla promise of a means of trans
mitting electricity by a method which will make un
derground wires cheaper than the overhead system,
even in the country and across the continent, is one
that holds out the prospect of greater benefit than
any other single feat of science since electricity was
first applied to human use. Should it prove to be
true, the Avhole problem of getting wires underground
will be settled. They will be driven there by the
simple but irresistible "force of economy.
Mr. Spreckels in bestowing the gift and General
Barnes in accepting it announced clearly that it is
intended not for Â£*n Francisco only, but "for all Cali
fornia; not for one class of people, but for all classes;
for the rich and the poor, the young and the old, for
the pioneer of the past, for the children of the future; for
men and women of culture, who delight in the sublim
est harmonies of classic music, and for the simple and
untutored, whose hearts are moved by the rippling
melodies of folk songs. In that broad, sympathetic
spirit it was designed and with an equal spirit it ha?
been received. Among the thousands who thronged
the grove on yesterday were representatives of all
the races and all the degrees of culture to be found in
the cosmopolitan life of California and in the respon
sive cheering that greeted the speakers was heard a
full expression of th? popular appreciation, not only
of the richness of the gift, but of its all comprehending
liberality. â¢
For generation? to come the people of California
and strangers within the gates of San Francisco will
be gladdened by the harmonies which shall pour forth
from the pavilion, and, strengthened and augmented
In- its resounding dome, float distinct and clear, far
and wide over the park. For a time that music will
be mainly foreign music, the strains of the giftcd'sing
ers of other lands, but the impulse it gives toward
musical culture will be felt by men and women of
genius in our own land and will stimulate them to
creative effort, so that in the years to come the music
that emanates from it will be largely Califomian
music. Then the patriotic hope of the generous donor
will be completed. The memorial of his citizenship,
the evidence of his devotion to the State and its peo
ple, will resound with melodies native to the land he
loves and thereby be even more symbolic than now
of the mutual pride which exists between the citizen
who so venerates his State and the State that honors
the worth of so munificent a citizen.
The excellence of the site chosen for the edifice and
the skill with which the structure" was designed to
serve the purpose of park concerts were amply proven
to all who attended the dedication. It was a day of
wind and mist, but in the shelter of the pavilion and
of the groves that surround it the force of the wind
was broken and tempered to the moderation of a
pleasant breeze and the mists that could be seen driven
along the upper air were absent altogether from the
actual scene of the festival. The sunlight shone there
and in its glow the radiant garments of richly dressed
women were brilliant as a garden of flowers. Every
thing was beautiful, bright and musical and every joy
ous moment of the time was an augury of a thousand
happy hours of melody and mirth to come.
"It is an architectural poem set to the music of an
inspired imagination." It was in those words General
Barnes described the stately structure when on behalf
of the people of California he accepted the gift. The
splendid sentence fits the splendid edifice. No further
description is needed. For all time to come the open
air concerts at the park will have a noble home, the
architecture and the music blending into one art,
pleasing both eye and ear and giving to the people a
double joy to make the gladness of their holidays.
A GIFT TO THE PEOPLE.
/^LAUS SPRECKELS' gift to the people of Cali
l fornia, the massive pavilion at Golden Gate
Park, was yesterday formally transferred to the
public and dedicated to music. The ceremony was
the chief feature of the celebration of the day and it
was right that it should be so, for the structure is to
stand for ages to attest that in the fiftieth year of her
history as a State of the AmericauJJnion the glory of
California is undimmed, the patriotism of her people
ardent, their artistic culture high and the liberality of
her private citizens capable of the noblest munificence.

NEW YORK. Sept. 9.â It seems to be
the general opinion that a more thorough
airing of recent secret scandals of the
prize ring will be given now that Corbett is
away. Indeed, many believe that, realizing
that an exposure was Inevitable, he fled
to England to escape criticisms which
would be heaped upon him. How much
light will be shed upon the peculiar doings
that have occurred recently in the roped
arena as a result of Corbett's absence
from New York will depend entirely upon
those who are best able to talk.
illiam A. Brady, Thomas O'Rourke,
John Considlne, John Kelly and Charles
"White are in a position to know of any
existing dishonest methods and of any at
tempts to hoodwink the public. Fitzsim
mons is here, but it is not believed that
he has been interested in any of the al
leged conspiracies except as a helpless
victim. But Jeffries is not far away,
neither is Sharkey; and McCoy announces
it as his intention to remain on Broadway
for at least another month. "Johnny"
White was here yesterday.
Mrs. Corbett, forsaken by her husband,
makes positive declaration that the recent
battle in Madison Square Garden, which
resulted in the ignominious defeat of
"Kid" McCoy, was not wholly honest. To
this McCoy in a communication to the
Herald answers: "Hell hath no fury like
a woman scorned."
McCoy made a positive denial of the
assertion that there had even been an
agreement between himself and Corbett
concerning the battle. McCoy has not
denied the insinuations concerning other
contests in which he has been engaged.
The young Hoosier once explained his de
feat at the hands of Sharkey by admitting
prearrangement. He has failed to explain
how he saved his fight with Choynski
after he was on the matting at least
twenty seconds. McCoy has said nothing
of the peculiarities of his battle witn
Peter Maher.
The fact that the second Mrs. Corbett is
now seeking a divorce from her husband
adds interest to the departure of her hus
band under an assumed name. A few
persons are interested in the latest movu
of the big pugilist, for the reason that
they expected him to obtain control of a
London lighting club, wherein he will en
gage in another contest with, the present
champion, Jeffries. Corbett has disposed
of his interest in the Broadway saloon
over which his name Is emblazoned. Ho
has also disposed of all of his property
and in going to Europe leaves nothing be
hind which is attachable.
Lmilie Lorenze, who was maid to Miss
Cornllle, the vaudeville actress, tells
strange tales of the infatuation of her
mistress. The maid says that Miss Co; 1 
nille dismissed all of her other admirers
and even destroyed all of their photo
graphs, lining her room with pictures of
the pugilist. In order that the maid
might be out of the way when it came
time to sail from Europe she was sent to
Philadelphia on a mythical errand.
Ihe present Mrs. Corbett, when seen
yesterday, said she would tell no more
stories concerning .her life with the pugil
ist until her suit for divorce is called in
court.

Observers on the channel coast stralnd

of one of the two German liners. The
Deutschland was expected to be the leads

the Kurbpean edition of the Herald told
how the Deutschland overhauled the
Kaiser Wilhelm on the second day out
from New York. From Sicily Islands, the
first bit of Knglish soil which greets the
trans-Atlantic traveler, the lights of tin
Hamburg-American liner were sighted al
ten minutes to 11 o'clock last evening.
.The observer at Lizard reported the win
ning ship at twenty-five minutes to 1
o'clock this morning. The North German
IJoyd liner is still not reported at Lizard.
The run to Plymouth was made in two
hours, the ship reaching there at half past

agent in Plymouth informs the Herald
that the time of the voyage was
five days and eight hours. The
Deutschland's previous record was
five days eleven hours and forty-flVtj

"The Iho-Chuan outlaws < Boxers), in

WORLD'S WARNING TO THE
WARRING CHINESE EMPIRE
Wonderful Spectacle When the Allied
Forces Traversed the
Imperial City.
Special I>i?patch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 9.-A Journal Taku
dispatch, dated September 4, says China's
most sacred temples and palaces have
been profaned by the armies of the civil
ized world which have inarched ruthlessly
over the traditions of the empire in the
progress t>< avenge the Peking outrages.
Mute lips an.i downtact eyes in the gium
households of the Ministers and the ser
vants as the allies trampled over the ap
pointed ground eloquently expressed the
chocked .sensibilities of the Chinamen.
Through the temples and past th.? thrones
looked upon as sacred marched the
spurred and armed soldiers, each footstep
warning China her ancient dynasty had
fallen. It was a wonderful spectacle when
three thousand allied troops crossed the
line into the forbidden city at Peking,
liut the finest of all in the line â for an
Arr.ericanâ wire the Yankee troops led by
General Chaffee. There were 4(K>, com

PHEPARING TO WITHDRAW

ly Improve Matters.
Special Disiatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 9.â Considerable
importance is attached by officials to the
return of Prince Ching to Peking. Infor
mation of bis arrival in the Imperial City
Â¦was communicated to Minister Takahira,
diplomaiic representative of Japan, by the
Foreign Otnce in Tokio. which had re
ceived the dispatch from General Yam
aguci. His arrival in Peking is, there
fore. of the greatest importance. Li Hung
Chang. It is expected, will proceed to Pe
king without delay to consult with Prince
Ching and the Ministers. It is considered
highly probable that before consenting to
proceed to the capital Prince Ching com
municated with the Emperor and Em
press Dowager, and understands their
wishes. Efforts will be made to induce
the imperial family to return to their
capital.
The administration la making every
preparation to withdraw General Chaffee
and his command from Peking should any
other nati'>n direct its troops to retire,
but at the same time it is earnestly en
deavoring to bring about the adoption of
a compromise, which contemplates the
retention in the imperial City of the le
gations, guarded by a .small international
force. One of the most daneernus phases
of the situation is the condition of the
Chinese residing between Taku and Pe
king. It will be easily understood how a
starving people, maddened hy the pres
ence of foreign troops directly responsible
for their condition, would turn upon the
invaders and give the officer who is in
command ample pretext for hostile opera
tions. So the President is making a de
termined effort to formulate a proposition
; which will be acceptable to all powers

After the championship rowing events 'Â¦
had taken place off Long wharf the slx
oared cutter crew of the Naval Militia.
Division 2, rowed over the course, which
they completed in the excellent time ot
12 minutes 33 seconds. Then the tug Re
lief, with the rejratta committees of the
Native Sons and of the Pacific Association
and their guests, steamed round to Pow
ell-street wharf to witness the Whitehall
sailing races- These were under the man
agement of the following: George H. S.
Drytlon. referco; W. F. Fitzgerald
starter; Captain Peter McGowan and
John T. Gateley; judges. There were fif
teen entries, but only seven of these start
ed. The course was from Powell-street
wharf to Blossim Rock buoy, round it and
back to a siakebont off Mfigsjs wharf
round it and out to a st.ikeboat off Fort
Point, round that and home to Meiggg
wharf. There was a very stiff breeze in
the channel and three of the whitehalla
capsized beforo cr while rounding Blos

to capsize to windward. The other boats
were capsized in gybing round Blossom

but it warmed up in the fifth and the
clubs came past the tape in the following

Angeles Wheelmen. A. C. Muff; Garden
City Wheelmen, Lace Downing; Capital
City Wheelmen, A. Buckrath: Terminal

Reno in 13:06 3-5. This relay was ridden
for Reno by H. I>- Bean, who took B.
Noonan's place, the 'atter having been
thrown in the half-mile handicap. The
corrected time of each club in the five re
lays follows:

The rtnal in the half-mile scratch was
won by Russ in 1:14 1-5, F. Hoffmann sec
ond and Y. Pearne third.
The first automobile race over a two
mile course ever run on the coast was one
of the interesting events of the day. It
was won by M. Rockett with a locomobile
in three heatsâ time, 2:09 3-5. The other
contestants in locomobiles were E. A.
Boeseke M. Mousehardt and George P.

The crowd that paid *. round GO cents to
enter the grounds and an added half of

The lirst game between the top-notchers

This same inning, the fifth and tho sixth
bore fruit for the local men. In the fourth
Krug scored soon aft**r a phenomenal

who destroyed in its very iniancy a pos

the fifth a double by Schwartz and a Sin

Dereak
HANK'S GERMAN NINE
"WALLOPS" THE SENATORS
Millers satisfied their venom on their
rivals for show money. Babbitt was in
tho box for Stockton and Farrow for
Oakland and to those men belong the
honors of the day. Four hits off Farrow
and one less than that oft Habbitt were
the pitchers' recorded punishment.
Oakland's defeat was in preat measure
due to a triplicate of errors by

pave four runs to Stockton. Moore's play
at third was of the highly sensational

Harlean Gladys Won the Futurif- stafta
yesterday at Union C<mrateeJ?Â£rt Jk !
J>o hound on the card was stronr enou*i
to offset the clever work of these fast
youngsters. Throughout The stake both
dogs exhibited their S arr,enes 3 ! and the
positions they gained were due to mer
itorious couraing. devoid of nukes
Floodgate reached the fifth round
where he went out to the runner rt> Al
though the score in this eourw wa/ close.
the three points scon.l by FlooogaU
were through favor of the hare, while
J-ovina earned all of her points.
In tne Champion stake it was Palo Al
to s day to run. and it was easv work
for him to polish oft his oi.pon.en.td He
was easily the best doer la this event
and. In contrast to his recent work, never
overlooked a chance, but went in to kill.
Sacramento Boy reached second place!
and showed himself a clever hound.
Flora .McDonald never ran better. Sue
beat Sir Pasha in the third round, scoring
23 to hla 16. and then went against the
almost invincible Palo Alto.
The programme offered proved a strong
drawing card, and it is doubtful it a.
larger crowd ever attended Union Park.

Growth of Reform Sentiment.
The breach In the dominant party was
not healed, but was rather widened by
certain appointments of President Gar
fleld. Both the New Tork Senators re
signed their seats when they were refu3ed
the privilege of dictating the choice of a
customs collector for the port of Xew
York, and an acrimonious factional quar
rel embittered Oarfteld's brief Incum
bency. He fell by the hands of a disap
pointed and revengeful office - seeker
in July, 1SS1, and died the following Sep
tember.
This tragrlc Illustration or the evil ten
dency of the spoils system of dispensing
government patronage effectually con
vinced all parties and all classes of the
Imperative need of a different method of
determlnlns appointments to office.
The "star route" scandals which cams
to light In 1SS1 still further emphasized
the disgraceful state of the government
service. The star routes (so called be
cause marked In the catalogue with an
asterisk) were stage lines over which
mails were distributed In the West. Five
million dollars was annually appropriated
bv the postofftce department for the ser
vice of these lines, while It was said
that over some of them not more than
three letters a week were carried. It
came out in the Investigation of 1SS1 that
a deliberate plot waa devised by postal
officials between 1ST3 and 1880 for In
creasing the amount of apparent service
and the cost for certain of these lines,
leaving a deficit for the others which
Congress was called to meet. The money
of which the Government was defrauded
went Into the pockets of the conspirators.
The trial of the case exposed all the un
savory details to the Intense disgust of
the whole nation.
In January. 1383, a civil service reform
bill drawn by a Democratic Senator â

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Sept. 9.
Harvesting of the grape crop of L,iver
more Valley has commenced. There will
be no loss from lack of. pickers. Grow
ers are satisfied that there will be suf
ficient labor to gather the yield.
Reports from the valley Indicate a good
yield and excellent quality, Insuring to
vineyardists a superior vintage. Prices
arc ranging from $16 to $30 a ton. The
bulk of the buying is at the former fig
ure. Several choice lots have been taken
at the higher quotation.
In a review of the situation the Liver
more Herald says:
"ThÂ«Â» season nas been a peculiar one.
The heavy frosts late in April and the
dry winter were thought for a time to
have completely destroyed the crop, and
the growers were despondent until a phe
nomenal storm in May revived the droop
ing vines and : tarted the new wood and
blossoms. In midsummer the prospects
were again in a fair way to be blighted
by a succession of hot days, wblch
ithreatened to destroy what grapes re
mained. A long spell of cold, damn
weather followed, and the crop was saved.
The grapes are large, firm and juicy, and
the percentage of sugar is all that could
be asked."
The California Wine Association has re
newed wine-making for the first time In
two years. It is estimated that the
grape yield of the valley will be one
third greater than last year.

Henry A. Chittenden, a journalist of
note and the man who -secured for this
city the $50,000 Carnegie Free Public Li
brary, died this morning at 5 o'clock at
his residence, 1529 Spring street, Berke
lev. His illness had been of many months'
duration, and became serious during the
last thirty days. Death was caused by
a tubercular affecti6n of the throat.
After many years of active service In
prominent Eastern newspaper offices Mr.
Chittenden was compelled, in 1S97, to
come to California because of 111 health.
He continued, however. In his journal
istic labors, and it was while so engaged
in this city that he conceived the plan
to secure a free public library building
for his new home. Having had close
personal relations with Andrew Carnegie,
Mr. Chittenden successfully presented to
the Pennsylvania steel magnate Oak
land's needs In that direction. The re
sult of the correspondence was the dona
tion of $50,000, which has made possible
the structure which is now in course of
erection.
Mr. Chittenden was a type of the jour
nalist of the New York Herald school,
with which, after years of previous actlv
itv, he was identified in various capaci
ties for a number of years. He was born
April 11, 1S4R, at Hartford, Conn. His
father was a prominent abolitionist and
a leading New York wholesale dry goods
merchant. At the age of 17 years the
young man entered Yale University, from
which he was graduated in 1S67.
From college he went almost Immedi
ately into newspaper work, beginning his
successful career, with the Brooklyn (N
Y.) Daily Union, a patriotic journal
founded by his uncle. S. B. Chittenden,
during the civil war. For two years he
waa Its editor, associated with Edward
Cary, editor-in-chief.
Mr. Chittenden took a course under Pro
fessor Theodore Dwight at Columbia Law
School, and was admitted to practice be
fore the Supreme Court of New York.
H-> then went to the New Tork Standard,
under John Russell Young, serving as re
porter, then nifht editor, then editorial
writer. Later he went to Milwaukee,
where : he acquired an Interest In the
Journal of Commerce, which, under his
management, became a political dailyâ
Cf mmerclal Time?. For five years, with
his brother. Daniel Oano Chittenden. he
conducted a campaign which left its im
press upon the city. Later the. Times
was merged into the News, which news
paper the Chittendens sold to Robertson
James, a brother of the novelist. Henry
James. Then Mr. Chittenden returned to
his father's home in New Jersey for rest.
A year later' he was called by James
Gordon Bennett to become editor of the
New York Evening Telegram. Fifteen
yrars Mr. Chittenden spent In the Ben
nett service, several of which he occu
pied in various departments on the New
York Herald. One of his achievements
was to win a first prize of $500 offeÂ»ed by
Bennett for the most acceptable ed
itorial paragraphs written by ITeraM re
porter" during a nori^-i of Â«lx months.
Coming to California with his family,
Mr. Chlttennen made his home In Oak
land until two months ago. when he re
moved to Berkeley. He engaged In ed
itorial work in San Francisco and on the
Oakland Tribune. While on the latter
paper he carried out the free library en
terprise.

tlement and the South might bend her en
ergies to the weary task of effacing the
sorrowful records of the hitter conflict.
That all is not yet accomplished even
after the lapse of a quarter of a century
of labor should not surprise us when we
recall the long years of growing estrange
ment and the stupendous struggle with its
fearful cost in blood and treisure.
A century of national life had now
passed. Many a problem had been settled.
A stable, tried, perfected government com
manded the loyal regard of the whole peo
ple. Peace and brotherhood dominated the
opening of the new era. Old things were
passed away; behold, all things were be
, come new.
Resumption.
As the Southern question gradually lost
prominence matters directly affecting the
welfare of every part of the lacd came to
the front.
The constitutionality of the legal-tender
p?.per currency created by the Govern
ment in the stress of war had been dis
puted from the beginning and had been
denied by a decision of the Supreme Court
in 18fiD. But the appointment of two new
Justices the following year led to a re
versal of judicial opinion and the paper
currency was pronounced constitutional.
Nevertheless, the business wisdom of the
country demanded a return to specie pay
ments and the Republicans became com
mitted to a policy of speedy resumption
by an act passed in 1^..>. which set the 1st
of January. 1ST!), for beginning the re
demption in coin of the legal-tender notes.
The return to specie payments was op
posed by a party calling itself the Inde
pendent National Party, but popularly
known as the Oreenbackers or the Green
back party. The Greenhackers held their
first convention in ISTfi. and nominated
Peter Cooper for President, and they also
put forth tickets in the two or three suc
ceeding, campaigns. They advocated a
permanent irredeemable paper currency.
Since 1S6S the Democrats have shown a
leaning toward a financial policy similar
to that of the Greenbackers. They have
looked askance upon Republican projects
for resumption of specie payments, and
In later years have been Inclined to favor
one form or another of "soft money" as
against the "hard money" to which Re
publicans have inclined. The second Con
gress of Hayes' administration contained
Democratic majorities In both branches,
but the party waa not sufficiently com
pact and united to take effective ad
vantage of Its nominal ascendency, and
the return to specie payments was quietly
accomplished at the appointed time.
The Sliver Question.
The proposed return to a specie basts
raised the question as to the metal In
which payment should be made. At that
time the United States had only subsid
iary silver coins In circulation, and -was
coining no - other?. An act of 1873 defi
nitely omitted the silver dollar from the
list of United States coins, continuing
only the subsidiary coinage, which was
legal tender for small debts. This "de
monetization" of the silver dollar waa
followed by a great depreciation In the
value of silver as compared with gold, al
though that decline was caused rather by
certain acts of European Governments
than by the American coinage law. TnÂ«
silver mining Interests of the United
States were Injuriously affected, and the
withdrawal of the silver dollar came to be
regarded by a large proportion of the ag
ricultural and mining population of the
South and West as a grievance of the
first rank. Hence arose a movement,
which soon gathered great force, for thÂ«
"remonetizatlon" of the sliver dollar with
full legal tender value, which. It was be
lieved, would supply that abundance of
"cheap money" regarded by the "Silver
party" as necessary to the national pros
perity. This tended to array what were

Japanese Fireworks.
One of the rr.osi unique features of the
day's celebration at the Park was the dis
play of daylight liroworks given by M.
Harfwara of the Japanese Gardens in
honor of the dÂ« delation of the new music
stand. The handsome pieces a-s they ex
ploded in the h< â¢Â¦'v-ns and crew into fan
tastic shapes ai"* *>cts amused the vast
populace ar.d could be seen for miles
fir :::&.
The fireworks were especially manufac
tured by M. Hagiwara for the occasion.
They wore pent skyward from the mouths
of bamboo cannons placed in iÂ»osiiion just
south of the garden. The projjramme in
cluded imitations of thunder, raining in
Filver and cold, crystal heaven, swallows
â¢n yellow clouds, dark clouds. Illy in yel
low clouds, national flags of all powers,
elv^s and animals, wild geest", umbrella in
chape "f a water lily opening, flowers and
called the "moneyed Interests'* of the
Eastâ represented more especially by the
bankers and "money kings" of Wall
street, who resisted the restoration of
the silver dollarâ against the producing
classes of the West.
The "Bland-Allison silver bill." brought
forward by Bland of Missouri, was passed
by large majorities through a Democratic
House and a Republican Senate over th*
President's veto In 1S7S. It provided for
the coinage of a silver dollar of 412^
grains, which should be a legal tender
for all debts. As first Introduced the bill
provided for free and unlimited coinage.
An amendment, however, was Introduced
before the passage of the act which re
moved the provision for free coinage ami
required the mints to purchase bullion
at the market price and to coin the new
dollars at the rate of not less than 2.00O,-
Of*) nor more than 4.000,000 a month. The
disastrous effects of the Bland law upon
the credit of the nation, which were pre
dicted by experienced financiers, -were
held In check by this amendment re
stricting the amount of the coinage and
placing the whole matter In the hands of
the Government. Gold and silver con
tinued to circulate upon equal terms.
Much political agitation since then has
raged around that restriction, and a
strong demand has been made for thÂ«
absolutely free and unlimited colnaga of
silver.
Republican Dissensions.
The failure of the third-term movement
In 1S76 did not kill It. and representatives
of the "Grant dynasty" made actlva
preparations for a return to power in
1SS0. under the plausible plea that a re
election of Grant, after a lapse of a four
year term, would not be, In its technical
ami objectionable aense, election to a
third term. Conkllng of New York waa
the leader of the enterprise, which many
regarded as a formidable attempt to re
store the spoils system to Its former su
premacy In the Republican party. Presi
dent Hayes, while cordially favoring a
reform of the civil service, had not had
the effective support of Congress, and
abuses of a flagrant character had con
tinued to sully the record of Republican
rule. The sentiment In favor of legal
regulation of the patronage of the Gov
ernment grew stronger within and with
out the party.
Meanwhile Republican dissensions
waxed bitter as the election of 1SS0 drew
near. Ulaine waa again the choice of a
strong element In the party, but In the
convention, which met In Chicago In
June. Grant led all other candidates in
every one of the thirty-six ballots taken
until the last. Blaine standing second,
until the last, when most of his support
ers went over to Garfleld. along with
those who had favored Krtmunds. Sher
man, "Washburne or Wlndon. The Grant
phalanx remained unbroken and met their
defeat with a sullen obstinacy which
augured ill for party union. To placate,
them the Vice Presidency was given to
Arthur of New York on the nomination
* ; -Â«Â»
by Seymour Eaton.
End of Carpet-Bag Government
With the inauguration of Hayes and
Wheeler the l T nited States entered upon a
new period of growth and development,
under normal conditions. The unnatural
relations between the Federal Government
and the Southern States which had sub
sisted from the close of the war were
brought to an end and the States were
left to adjust themselves in their own
ways to the changes introduced by the
war. President Hayes Immediately with
drew military support from the Republi
can governments of South Carolina and
Louisiana and recommended their Govern
ors to -resign. They did so. and the dis
crediu-d "carpet-bag" rule in the South
thus came to a final end. Democratic pov
crnments were at once set up under white
supremacy. A similar change toolc place
In Florida through decisions of the courts,
and the "Solid South" arose to confront
the so long triumphant Republican party.
The prompt rise of the Democratic pa*-ty
to power in the South which followed the
removal of the Federal troops took place
without disturbance. The whole country
was weary of the excessive prolongation
of sectional strife. There was a general
; disposition to let the whole matter drop
out of sight, leaving to the various States
1 the adjustment of their own internal dlf
; ficulties, while the attention of the nation
might be turned to the many subjects of
general importance which demanded set-

Pete Gibney, an old man. Is dying In the
City and County Hospital from the effects
of a fracture of the skull received Thurs
day evening in a saloon at Bryant and
Converse streets. He was In the saloon
drinking with some other men,, among
whom was P. Butler, wnen a row started.
Glbeney started to leave the place when
Butler struck him, knocking him down.
As he fell his head struck against the
curbstone, fracturing the skull. The In
jured man was taken to hia home and as
it was apparent that he was severely in
jured he was removed to the City and
County Hospital. Yesterday his condition
became alarming and the police were at
once notified. After considerable trouble
Policeman Clancy, who was detailed by
Captain Splllane to arrest Butler, found
him on Howard street and took him into
custody. He was immediately taken to
the City Prison, where he was locked up
in the tanks pending the result of his
victim's injuries.
Â¦ To the police Butler denied having
struck Gibney. He, however, admitteu
that he "shoved him In a playful way,"
but denied having seen him fall. Tha
statement Is ridiculed bv two eye witness
es to the trouble. They were standing in
the vicinity of the saloon, they claim,
when Gibney walked outside and stood
near the edge of the sidewalk. Butler at
this juncture walked out of the saloon
and going up to the old man struck him.
The force of the blow knocked Gibney
down, and as he fell his head struck the
curbstone.
Yesterday the two witnesses visited tho
City Prison and positively identified But
ler as the man who struck Gibney.
The two witnesses went to Glbney's as
sistance and endeavored to get him on hi3
feet. Butler stood by and seeing the blood
gushing from the wound in Gibney'd
head left the scene, evidently fearing ar
rest.

Mass Meeting of Young Men.
A union mass-meeting was held yester
day afternoon at the Young Men's Chris
tian Association building. The Rrv. G. C.
Adams, pastor of the First Congregation
al Church. A. P. Black ar.d W. M. Par
sons. State secretary of the V. M. C. A..
addressed the meeting. A special musical
programme was rendered, including sev
eral numbers by the Knickerbocker quar
tet.
SHE popular double bill. "Cavallerla
Rustlcana" and Pagliacci," will be
the week's attraction at the Tivoli
Opera-house, and will be given at
every performance this week, in
cluding the Saturday matir.ee. It will
be presented by alternate casts, and the
whole company will appear during the
week. It is doubtful if any more popular
bill could have been selected to please the
visiting population.
For the holiday attraction at the Co
lumbia, Clay Clement will present "The
New Dominion," in which he will be
heard in his favorite role of Baron Ho
henstauffen. L. R. Stock-well is also In
the cast, and Mrs. Clement will be heard
In an appropriate role. Special matinees
will be given to-day and to-morrow.
'The Girl I Left Behind Me," Belasco &
Fyles' war drama, is to be given at the
Alcazar Theater this week for the enter
tainment of the visitors, and will be pre
sented for the first time this afternoon.
A special matinee will also be given to
morrow.
â¢ â¢ *
Ferris Hartman and "Ship Ahoy." at
the Alhambra, are a combination well cal
culated to catch the crowd. The company
averages up well. The chorus is remark
ably well drilled in its new and pretty
turns.
Captain Jack Crawford's "On the
Trail," at the Alta, is a distinctly suita
ble bill for "the week. It deals with pic
turesque adventure and striking charac
ters and situations among which Captain
Crawford's life has been passed.
The Orpheum has a winner for the week
In Jessie Bartlett Davis, who, though the
has not been driven into a vaudeville
martyrdom by envious rivals in the "le
gitimate," as alleged, is nevertheless a
strong attraction. Querita Vincent, the
Young American Quintet and Johnson
and Dean, are other new features.
The California Theater is still "dark,"
but will probably open next Saturday
evening with the Azzali Italian Opera
Company in "Otello."
Mae Tunlson, Eudora Forde, J. K.
VIcco, L. E. Behan, Howard and Camp
bell, Olive Vail and Dutch Walton are the
features at the popular Fischer's Concert
House. Special moving pictures have also
been prepared and the excellent orchestra
will add to the interest.
To-night will be Native Daughters night
at Pain's electric fireworks exhibition and
"Battle of San Juan," at the Sixteenth
and Folsom streets grounds. Pain's is one
of the greatest pyrotechnic successes ever
seen in San Francisco.
The Olympla announces the tenth series
of Conradi's Living Statuary and a Dance
of All Nations for the week. ,
The Chutes has provided an excellent
bill for holiday week. The leading fea
tures are Weston and Herbert, musical
comedians; Sid Baxter, balancer and
juggler; Carroll, the young whistler;
Baby Ruth, the Malcolms, La LJsta, fire
dancer; the great lion net and new mov
ing pictures. To-night a grand display of
fireworks will take place on the Chutes
lake.
AT THE THEATERS.
Frank Edrich, a middle-aged man. yes
terday accosted Officer Klynn on Howard
street and begged him to assist him in
rescuing his 3-year-old child from tho
clutches of the little one's dissipated
mother. He said the baby was In the
'â¢Black Cat" saloon at 100S Howard street
with its mother, who was In a beastly
state of Intoxication. The policeman, af
ter listening to his story, went into the
saloon and found the tot, neglected and
dirty, lying on a pile of rags in the rear
of the place. The mother was discovered
in one of the rooms, helpless from the
effects of liquor. Edrich was allowed to
take the child, while the unnatural
mother was removed in the patrol wagon
to the Citv Prison. While being charged
with drunkenness she. was recognized as
the woman for whom a warrant was re
cently issued charging her with grand
larceny. .
According to the complaining witness In
the larceny case, a young man named
Harry Smith, the woman and her consort,
who is known as Harry McCosh. some
time ago robbed him of $25 and a gold
watch and chain. McCosh was arrested
shortly after the warrant was Issued and
held In the tanks pending the apprehen
sion of the woman.
As soon as she was identified in the
City Prison yesterday she and McCosh
were formally booked for grand larceny.
Additional charges of vagrancy and
drunkenness were recorded against the
woman.
With tears streaming down hla face
Edrich. the husband oi the woman, told
the story of his wife's downfall.
"We were married about five years
ago," he said, "and for a time she was a
model wife. Suddenly she acquired a
taste for liquor and I was forced to sep
arate from her. I took our little girl and
placed her with some friends In the Mis
sion. About a month i:go my wife went
to the house and stole the child. Since
then she has been in the habit of taking
the little one to saloons with her and
allowing her to witness the disgraceful
orgies in which she participated.
"Shortly after noon to-day I learned
that my wife and baby were In the How
ard-street saloon. Going Inside I started
to take our baby away, when one N of the
patrons, a rough looking man. grabbed me
by the collar and kicked me Into the
street. It was then that I appealed to the
police officer to assist me in recovering
my lone lost child."
Edrich Intends to commence proceedings
for a divorce against his wife to-day.

The â¢weather yesterday was a disap

A visitor with a babv in her arms fell
from a car on the way to the beach, but
both escaped uninjured. Fortune was

ship well In hand, and thinking the tugs
and ferryboats would keep out in the bay
I made an inshore course. When I got off
Folsom street the winJ fell light and the
tide, which was running at least four
miles an hour, took command of the ves
sel.
"When I saw we were getting danger
ously near the Iowa I ordered tho topsails
backed, but it was too late to avert the
disaster. I think we sat down on the
Iowa's ram and the next swell carried us
off again. The Iowa's boys gave us a
great cheer as we sheared off, thinking we
were not damaged. We drifted away into
the mist and I don't think half a dozen
people on the battle ship knew we had
sunk until they saw the morning papers."
Vidette Badly Damaged.
The bark Vidette that was run down by
the May Flint is in a bad way. She Is
leaking badly and were it not for the
fact that she is lumber laden the pumps
could not keep her afloat. She was raked
fore and aft and as sho lies at Fremont
street wharf looks like a wreck. All tho
headgear is gone and the fore and main
topgallant and royals are gone. The fore
standing rigging has been carried away,
while the main standing rigging is badly
chafed. Some of the deckload of lumber
was carried away, and all In all it will be
many a day before the Vidette goes to sea
again.
TV. E. Mighell, managing owner of the
May Flint, when seen last night seemed
inclined to lay the blame for the loss of
the vessel on the captain.
"He should have remained in the lower
bay and not attempted to make a grand
stand play. Mr. Babcock is out of town,
but will be back on Wednesday. In the
meantime we will make no move. To
morrow, however, we will hold an inves
tigation and Wednesday we will decide
what to do with tho ship and cargo. I'm
afraid everything will be a total loss."
A small plunper showing a red light
was anchored lnsj evening 150 feet north
west by west of the sunken vessel as a
danger signal to mariners. Captain Se
bree, lighthouse Inspector, took soundings
at the wreck and the least depth he got
above the hulk was twenty-one feet at
low tide. The depth of the bay at that
point is about 90 feet. Captain Sebree
gives the location of the sunken vessel as
4oo yards northeast of the end of the Pa
cific Mail dock.
destruction of the May Flint was the
lack of information which marked the
catastrophe. The sailors on the Iowa saw
her apparently retreat from the imminent
danger of the monster ram and they gave
cheer after cheer of earnest congratula
tion as they believed she had escaped.
She had been shattered, however, by the
battleship's ugly weapon and was fast
sinking.
Representatives of the Harbor Commis
sion believed as did the sailors of the
Iowa and they also were mistaken.
They saw the May Flint disappear from
the fairway and believed that she was
in a safe place, but she had gone to the
bottom of the bay after colliding with
and almost destroying the lumber ship
Vidette, which was towed almost dis
mantled yesterday to Fremont street
wharf.
"We had a most delightful trip down the
coast," said Captain Woodside yesterday.
"I have been forty years at sea and can
never remember having a more auspicious
voyage. We left the Sound a week ago
with more than 50O tons of coal aboard
and made a wonderfully quick run to the
heads. Passing in through the Gate, I de
cided that tho wind would fall light and
signaled for a tug.
"Mind you, I never thought of, and. In
fact, only knew in a vague way that there
was to be a celebration on tho bay. I was
therefore surprised when no tug answered
my signal.
Ran Into Trouble.
"Next our instructions are to anchor in
the 'upper bay' and this instruction was
more than binding on me when the fact
is known that I had coal for the Black
Diamond Company and Cornwall had not
an ounce in his yard.
"Not receiving a tug:, we came up the
bay with a four-knot tide and a fair wind.
Sail was shortened, and when the May
Flint passed Lombard street she was
makinp a good seven knots.
"As soon as the "upper bay' opened out
I saw there was trouble ahead. The place
was swarming with ferry boats and
launches. Then I thought of wearing
ship, but ripiit in the way of any such at
tempt was the British shipr, Eudora and
Robert Duncan and the German bark
Anjou. A collision with any one of them
would have been disastrous, so I deter
mined to hold on.
"Passing Pacific-street wharf I had the
THOUSANDS of people thronged the
wharves of the city yesterday to
get a view of the sunken bark
May Flint, which had contributed
to the spiendid bay celebration of the
ni;?ht before its only accident. In the
maze of gay color which adorned the
docks, among the thousands of brilliant
flaps and the forest of masts were the
black forms and caper faces of people
seeking to see what was left of the
wreck. Scores of tiny craft plowed their
way out to tho place where the ship was
supposed to be.
An unusual interest attached to the de
stroyed vessel and to the Incidents which
hid marked its wrecking. The disaster
had been one of the most curious in the
history of the harbor. Seafaring men were
unanimous in their belief that Captain
Woodside took too many chances in en
tering the harbor without pilot or tup.
Expressing these opinions seafaring
men went out to the scene of the wreck,
but they could see nothing of the de
stroyed vessel. Only an anpry tide ripple
and the significant presence of a buoy
told where the ship had gone down.
Among ships the May Flint was a levia
than. Her history had been a strance one.
Story after etory of cruelty was record
ed in her career. Those that had worked
upon her told of the heartlessncss of for
mer commanders, and If she was one of
the most imposinp of the vessels which
entered the bay, she also was one of the
most thoroughly detested.
May Be Blown Up.
It Is probable that she may TxÂ» raised,
if her back is not broken, in which event
she will be blown up. that her cargo of
oC<00 tons of coal may be saved. She rests
at the bottom of the bay in fifteen fath
oms of water and in the very heart of
the fairway for veFFels which p!y be
tween San Francisco and the mole of the
narrow-sraug-e railroad, on the other side
of the bay. She is valued at $50,000. and
frrangoments have been made to send
down divers to-day. There is no insur
ance upon her and whatever loss Fhe rep
resents must be sustained by her owners.
The officers of the battleship Iowa are
extremely angry at what they consider
to be the criminal daring of the captain
of the May Flint. While the tremendous
ram of the battleship sent the sailing
bark to the bottom it is feared that the
warship did not escape unharmed and
that she must be docked for repairs. It
Is feared that her ram has been deflected
and that immediate attention must be
piven to the Injury. The May Flint prac
tically fell upon the Iowa with a weight
of 7'X>0 tons, and this, it is believed, in
flicted serious damage.
The May Flint was a four-masted
bark. Formerly she had been a Fteamer
and was known as the Persian Monarch.
Fhe was wrecked on the Now Jersey
coast hut was saved, transformed Into a
bnrk and purchased by the California
Ship Company, the most influential
owner of sailing vessels In the world. She
had been engaged in coastwise traffic and
was the largest vessel in the service of
the California Ship Company. Her
wrecking will in all probability be the
subject of the most searching inquiry by
the United States authorities.

GATHERING IN
KNOWN CROOKS
The ship Lauriston, Captain Latta",
which arrived from Hamburg via South
Shields last Saturday night, had a most
eventful voyage. Rounding the Horn
nearly every sail was blown away and
through the ship's being driven south the
men suffered terribly.
At one time there were only four men
and an apprentice able to leave their
bunks and work the ship. All the others
were either frostbitten or prostrated by
the cold. At one timo it looked as if
the ship would be driven Into the ice pack,
but luckily a change came and finally the
Horn was rounded in splendid style.
The ship's log tells in a quaint but
thrilling manner the story of her passage
through the frozen zone. The extract
from this seaman's narrative, telling of
the worst part of the experience, Is as
follows:
On July 7â Mr. Cameron In charge of the
deck. At 2:30 a. m. a hard squall struck the
ship, throwing her over. Lowered away the
reefed upper topsail. Called the master, who
at once ordered all hands on deck to shorten
Ball. Squalls followed one another in quick suc
cession, now of hurricane force. Furled upper
topsails and the reefed mainsail. Squalls hard
and furious, sea rising rapidly and weather in
tensely cold. Started to haul the foresail up,
but lee clew ganet unhooked. Got the sail
close up by 4 a. m. Hands went aloft to furl
it, and had the sail on the yard three times,
but let It go again. While the crew were on
the foreyard the jigger lower topsail sheet
carried away. Managed to haul the sail up,
but lee buntline came adrift from the yard.
Kail Immediately Happed to pieces beyond re
pair, having no one to furl the sail. Mountain
ous sea rising. Ship laboring heavily. Deck
constantly full of water, rail and rail at times.
Gear got foul washing about.
At S a. m. crew came down from the foresail,
not being able to furl the sail, all exhausted.
Four "A. Bs." and two boys severely frostbit
ten. The clews of the upper topsails and top
gullant sails blew out of the gaskets. The leach
of the main topsail all gone. Fore upper top
sail clews in rags. Cannot get the crew aloft
to furl them, they being completely exhausted.
At 10 a. m. the fore topmast staysail was
blown clean out of the ropes. Not a vestige
of canvas left. Blowing terribly. Squalls of
hurricane force and mountainous sea. Ship
laboring very heavily and straining severely.
Four "A. Us." laid down to it. also second offi
cer â all. badly bitten. Deck continually full of
water. Rooms and cabins Hooded.
Eighth hourâ Abating somewhat. Endeavor-
Ing to get the crew aloft to furl the Fall?. At
1 p. m. got the crew aloft and made fast all
sail and the remains of the topsails. Made
everything clear for wearing ship. Two more
"A. Bs ." gone off duty.
At 2:30 p. m. wore ship to southeast. Ship
laboring very heavily, constantly full of water
and shipping very heavy seas. Gear ail fouled
around the deck, owing to the continual wash.
At 3 p. m. sighted the Dleso Rameriz rocks,
bearing east by north standard and distant
three miles. Gale abatinjr somewhat, but driv
ing right toward them. Set foresail and reefed
mainsail. Cut all the gear of the mainsail to
set the sail set. Four more "A. Bs." laid up.
completely done up and hands benumbed
through frostbites. Having a very anxious
time. Not another sail to set. Decks con
stantly full of water and ship rolling danger
ously.
At 6 p. m. moderating decidedly. All the
apprentices, except Bromham, and all the crew,
except four "A. Bs." and carpenter, have laid
down, completely played out Weakness and
fear possess them.
At 8 p. m. fitted grear on mainsail with offi
cers, four "A. Bs.." carpenter and one boy.
Hauled the mainsail up afterward and furled
it by midnight. Our feet froze in our boots.
The Lauriston brings a sreneral cargo
and the chances are tnat some of It has
been damaged. The underwriters are,
therefore, sure to declare a "general av
ace."
