CALL BURKAI'. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Aug. 31.â The
administration is planning to incrpa.se the naval force under Admiral Re
mey In Chinese waters. It is known that the Navy Department recently
inquired into the strength of the toreign squadrons in Asiatic waters, and
found that the Unitr-d States forcp was even below that of China. There is
* reason to believe that the advisability itf adding to Remey's force has been con
sidered by the naval policy board, headed by Admiral Dewey, v.hich is now in ses
sion at Newport. Jr. a'eordar.e^ with a request from Admiral Dewey. Rear Ad
miral Eradforci. chief of the bureau of equipment, went to Newport four days ago
to confer with the board, and he returned to Washington last night. Admiral
Bradford declines to talk of the purpose of his visit. but it is stated on good author-
Sty that he particularly discussed the advisability of coaling stations i'n the event
of a general conflict. in reference to the Pacific Ocean. The colliers
Oacsar with 4&Â»0 tors. Scandia with ZV<ft tons and Saturn with 2700 tons are al
rrady on their way to China. Orders have been issued for the collier Southery,
with a coal capacity of 2000 tons, to be repaired "with all dispatch" at an expense
of S.yÂ»,nrv). Repairs are also l.elng hastened on the colliers Nero, with a capacity of
Â«â¢'Â» tons: the Hannibal, which can carry 2500 tors, and the Justin, which has a
cargo capacity of 3000 tons. These vessels will proceed promptly to Asia and re
port to Admiral Remey.
"They will not d-Fcharge th*ir cargoes." said a high official this afternoon,
"but will remain attached to the fleet, ar.d should trouble occur they will be able
to transfer their coal supply to th" bunkers of the warships."
Thero are 22.000 tons of coai or. hand in Manila, 3CO0 tons at Guam and 10 915
tons at Honolulu. It may not be feasible, however, in case of conflict to reach
these coal piles, and the presence of the colliers will enable he American fleet to
etcam to any point it desires.
NAVflL FORCE IN CHINESE
WATERS TO BE INCREASED
CHICAGO. Aug. SI.â General Miles, who 1? In Chicago, regards It as quite
possible that a ger.tral conflict of the powers may result from the con
flitting interest? in China and he believes that an attempt on the part of
some of the powers to partition the Celestial empire among themselves
would be sufficient ground for th_- United States to resort to force. Gen
eral Miles also believes that the dismemberment of China would hold the pos
sibility of a great dnr.gor to the United States, in that the time might come
when the European nations would turn their covetous glances toward the
riches nf America and be tempted to combine against this country.
"I don't bellero that the acute stage of the Chinese cris'.s has passed," said
the general. "I believe that it is possible that the conflicting interests of the
powers vill yet bring on a general conflict, which will involve all the civilized
powers in the greatest war of modern tim^s. The danger arises from the
chance that some of the powers will attempt the dismemberment of the Chinese
empire. If the United States and Russia succeed in acting in harmony along the
lines of the reported agreement proposed between them it may result in a peace
ful outcome from the present situation."
"Do you believe that an attempt to partition China would 'result in a con
flict between the powers, general?"
"That Is my opinion."
"What attitude irould the United States adopt in that case, do you think?
"VWuld it fight?"
"I believe that St would have sufficient cause to fight," was General Miles'
response.
"So far as I can see. the most hopeful Indication is the chance that Russia
and the United States will agree to act together." he continued. "There is to
my mind, every rrapon to beiieve that Kuss'.a is actlr.g in good faith. Russia has
more to gain by the preservation of the integrity of the Chinese empire than she
hap by the policy of disruption. Fh<> has spent vast sums of money In the con
struction of the trar.s-Siberian railroad, the greatest enterprise of modern times."
GENERAL MILES PREDICTS
A GREAT WAR IN CHINA
BERLIN. Aug. 31. â German official telegrams announce that the German
forces In V> kin? occupy the northwestern portion of the city. The joint
proclamations of the ger.erals against plundering have thus far proved in
effectual. It Is reported that BOme 2),0"0 armed Chinese are about fifty
kilometer?: from Prkipfr. The German troops share in guarding the im
perial palace sn<i also bold the northwestern gate. A council of generals was
cal!ed for August 23 1
WASHINGTON. Auk. 21.â OUic'.als of the War Department are positive that
the soldiers of General Chalice's army took no part In the extensive looting
which followed the fail of the Chiner-e city of Tientsin. At the direction of Sec
retary Root peremptory orders were issued to military cftieem to exert every
riTort to prevent looting and to sevrelv punish disobedience of such orders. For
this reason and from reports which have come to the department the officials
are ccr.f.rirird in'the opinion that our men refrained from disregardlrg the orders
c{ their superiors. They think that the Chinese themselves are responsible for
much of The ril-agins ar.d disorder following the entry of the allies into the
city. There is considerable property In charge of our army at Tientsin for safe
keeping end protection.
LONDON, Sept. 1.â The Shanghai correspondent of the Times, wiring August
SO. Â«er.fls a report that an Imperial edict was recently Issued ordering Chauao
Shu Chlao, Commissioner of the Railway and Mining Bureau, and Hsu Tung,
pvardl.in of the heir apparent, to proceed south to investigate the conduct of the
Yar.trtse Viceroys, and that they have already started for Paoting F*u. The corre
spondent says that this rumor, if confirmed. Is undoubtedly serious.
"Germany's attitude toward the Chinese situation." says a dispatch to the
Times dated yesterday, "is causing much perplexity In Japan. The Germans at
Amoy having guaranteed life and property, the Japanese marines will now re
tire."
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. Lâ Official dispatches confirm the report of the oc
r?jj>ation of Tsitsikar. which leaves only Mukden to be captured In order to
place th* whole cf Manchuria in Russian possession. Apparently there is no In
tention to relax that hold. General Kouropatkin, the Russian Minister of War,
hss just ordered two batteries of Krupp puns to protect the Manchurian Rail
way. Eight new batteries of quick-firers will be distributed among the four
r.ew Siberian army corps.

PORTLAND, Ore., Aug. 31.â The prospects for a clash between Russia and Japan in the
near future arp causing some uneasiness .in this port among merchants interested in the
Oriental and Siberian trade. The representative of one of the largest operators in that field
cabled to a Portland house four days ago from Port Arthur that war was imminent between
Japan and Russia. As this .would have interfered; with some business in view the Portland house
cabled back that the war rumor was discredited here? To-day a second cable was received from
Port Arthur reading as follows: "Cable of, 27th confirmed." War is now certain." As the sender is
iii very close touch with officials high in the Russian service much credence is given the report in

Russia's Hasty Withdrawal
From Peking Would Speed
ily Cause an Open Rupture
Among the Powers.
It Is the Po ! !cy'of the United States to Pre
serve Harmony of Action in China, but
the Task Now Seems Most Difficult.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON' HOTEL. WASHINGTON*. Aug. 31.â An
early withdrawal from Peking by the United States, Great Britain,
Fraice. Japan and Russia may be anticipated, and it is not believed tr> be
probable that Germany and Italy would take the responsibility of re
maining alone. It Is the belief of the administration, however, that with
drawal from Peking at this time would be a mistake. Secretary Adee's note in
reply to the communication of the Russian Government declares that it is the
opinion of this Government that the purposes set forth in the note of July 3
can best be attained "by joint occupation of Peking unetor definite understand
ing among the powers until the Chinese Government shall have been re-estab
lished and shall be In a position to enter into new treaties with adequate pro
visions for reparation and guarantees of future protection."
What this Government desires above all else is harmony of action among the
powers. The President "dofs. not propose to be drawn into' any International
complications over China If it can possibly be avoided. The withdrawal of any
ene power from Peking would endanger such complications, and the United
States would at once recall General Chaffee and confine its efforts to the pro
tection of, Americans and their interests until such time as the powers might
be able to unite again upon a common line of action.
Russia has announced that the Russian Minister has been directed to re
tire from China and that Russian trocps will likewise be withdrawn. It is
the hope of the administration that Mr. Adee's note may influence the Russian
Government to reconsider this programme. It is hardly expected even In ad
ministration circles, however, that this result will be accomplished. Russia
will probably persist in her determination to leave Peking. That the United
States would consider the withdrawal of Russia as a termination of the concert
of the powers and as Introducing an element of friction, is shown by the state
ment in Mr. Adee's note "that any power which determines to withdraw its
troops from Peking will necessarily proceed thereafter to protect its Interests
in China by its own methods, and we think that this would make general with
drawal expedient." :*â¢.'" â¢
Whatever might be the attitude of other powers. Minister Conger and the
American forces would withdraw at once as the only means of avoiding seriou3
international complications.
France has already notified the United States, and presumably the other
powers, that she agrees with the position taken by this Government in reply
to the Russian communication. This means that France will also withdraw if
Russia carries out the programme she has announced. Definite declarations as
to the position of the other powers have not yet been received, but there are
Indication:-, that even Germany will be reluctant to take the lesponsibility of in
troducing discord by remaining in Peking if the others withdraw.
Copies of the reply to Russia have been cabled to Minister Conger and Gen
eral Chaffee, and there is good reason to believe that they have been directed to
follow the Russians or representatives of any other power that may leave Pe
king. At the same time they are to use every endeavor to secure harmony of
action by the various foreign Ministers and military commanders, with a view
to having all the Ministers and troops leave the Chinese capital simultaneously
if such a movement is decided upon. It is hoped that the other powers will adopt
the suggestion in Mr. Adee's note, and will instruct their military commanders
at Peking to confer together and act in concert.
The essential difference between the position of Russia and that of thÂ«
United States is clear. Russia believes that the time has come for the powers
to evacuate the Chinese capital and allow the Emperor and Empress Dowager
to return and set up their government without any outside Influence. Ths
United States, on the other hand, believes that the powers should come to a
definite understanding for the occupation of Peking pending the re-establlsh
ment of the Chinese Government. It Is feared here that if the foreigners should
withdraw before securing provisions for reparation and guarantees of future
protection of foreigners in China that these results will be more difficult to ob
tain. The Chinese people, it is feared, will look upon withdrawal as a retreat.
A dispatch received by the Japanese legation here reports the information
contained in Mr. Conger's cablegram yesterday that the allied forces were to
parade through the Chinese Imperial Palace on August 2, This parade, follow
ing the retreat of the Chinese troops and the capture of the Imperial City, will
doubtless have a good effect in Impressing the Chinese with the power of the
foreigners. But it is feared that little good may result from this lesson, and
that much difficulty may be encountered in securing a satisfactory guarantee
from China if a considerable force of troops is not at hand during the negotia
tions. However this may be. It Is not thought probable that Russia will mod
ify her programme, and the early withdrawal from Peking and an open rupture
among the powers seems inevitable.

BERLIN, Aug. 31.-The German Gov

DurDosea of Russia. In China.
The ItuBBian Charge d'Affalres yesterday
afternoon .made to me an oral statement re-
Fpectlng Russia's purposes In China to the
following effect: That, ae already repeatedly
declared, Ituspin has no designs of territorial
acquisition In China: that, equally with other
powers now operating there, Russia has sought
the safety of the legations at Peking and to
help the Chinese Government to repress the
troubles; that. Incidentally to necessary de
fensive moasiires on the Russla-n border, Rus
sia has occupied Niuchwang for military pur
poses, and as s.wn as order Is re-established
will retire troops therefrom If action of other
jiowers bo no obstacle thereto; that the pur
pope for which the various Governments .have
oo-operatod for the relief of the legations in
Peking has been accomplished; that, taking
the position that as .the. Chinese Government
has left Peking there la no. need for her rep
resentative to remain". Russia' has directed the
Russian Minister to retire, with his personnel,
from China: that the Russian troops will like
wise be withdrawn, and .that when the Gov
ernment of China shall regain - the reins of
government and afford an authority with which
the other powers can r deal, and will exprers
a -desire to enter into negotiations, the Rus
sian Government will also name its represen
tative. Holding these views and purposes Rus
sia Â»>xpress2S hope that the United States will
shnre the fame opinion.
To this declaration our reply has been made
by the following' memorandum:

Chinese correspondence, August 2S and 29,
1300. v-V-
WASHINGTON*. Aug. 31.-The
Russian note relative to the
withdrawal of Russia from Chi
na and the United States' re
sponse thereto were made pub
lir to-day by the State Department after
the Cabinet had fuily considered the ex
pediency of so doing. The correspondence
is unique in the history of diplomatic ex
change. It may be said to illustrate a
clever move by which the United States
Government again has assumed the leao.
In prescribing the policy of the powers re
specting the Chinese, trouble. This wao
accomplished by the State Dopartmeni
availing itself or the Russian note to ad
dress the powers with an Inquiry as to
their policies, an answer to which scarce
ly can be avoided.
Various meanings may be placed upon
the statements of the two principals to
this correspondence. Thus, on the one
hand, it may be noted that while Russia
announces a purpose to withdraw her
troops from China, still as to the occupy
ing force at Niuchwang n condition Is
attached that almost negatives the propo
sition as to that point. Respecting our
own attitude it appears that while believ
ing the best course to pursue Is to remain
in Peking our Government is still willing
to withdraw. Perhaps this means that if
there is to be separate action by the pow
ers in China the United States proposes to
deal with the situation with- a free hand.
It may be noted in connection with our
withdrawal statement that whereas Rus
sia proposes to withdraw from China, our
offer is to withdraw from Peking. A sig
nificant fact in that connection is that
General ChafTee, who is well advised of
the situation, having several days ago
been directed to prepare for. just such an
emergency as that precipitated by : the
Russian action, continues his preparations
for wintering the American troops in
China. Indeed, unless the men are afloat
and out of the Peiho within the next six
weeks they, are likely to remain in China
perforce, being- Icebound. General Charr.ee
"These are: To afford all possible protection
everywhere in China to foreign life and prop
erty; to guard and protect all legitimate for
eign Interests; to aid in preventing the spread
of the disorders to other provinces of the em
pire and recurrence â¢ of. such disorders, and
to geek a solution which may bring about per
manent safety and peace to China, preserve

LnttrnatinnaJ law to trlendiv Dowtri &ad uf>.
- "The present go<5d relation should be promoted
for the peace of China. While we agree that
the immediate object for which the military
forces. of the powers have. been co-operating,
viz., the relief of the Ministers at Peking, has
been accomplished, there still remains the
other, purposes which all the powers have In
common, which are referred to in the'com
munication of the Russian Charge d'Altalres
end which, were specifically enumerated In our
note to the power* of July 3.
Â° "So far as we are advised, the greater part of
China is at peace, and earnestly desires to pio
tect the life and property of all foreigners, and
in several of the provinces active and success

taken by Viceroys, to whom we have extended
encouragement through our Consuls and naval
officers.
"The Government of the United States re
ceives with much satisfaction the reiterated
statement that Russia has no designs of terri
torial acquisition In China, and that, equally
with the othtr powers now operating In China,
Russia has sought the safety of her legation in
Peking and to help the Chinese Government to
repress' the existing troubles. The same pur
poses have moved and will continue to control
the Government of the United States, and the
frank declarations of Russia In this regard are
In accord with those made to the United States
by th* other powers. All the powers, therefore,
having disclaimed any purpose to acquire any
part of China; and now that adherence thereto
has been renewed since relief has reached Pe
king, It ought not to be difficult, by concurrent
action through negotiations, to reach an amica
ble rettlemcnt with China by which the treaty
rights of all powers will be secured for the fu
ture, the open door assured, the Interests and
property of foreign citizens conserved and full
reparation made for wrongs and injuries suf
fered by them. '

to succeed Charles F. Mayer as president
of the B. and O. R. R. He had been con
nected with the road for a number of
years in a legal capacity and while he
could not save it from the disaster which
had for some years been Impending, he
was made co-receiver with Oscar G. Mur

in putting it on good financial footing, in-'
teresting Marshall Field, J. J. Hill, Nor

LOCAL OFFICIALS YET
FAVOR H. E. HUNTINGTON
The prevailing feeling among Â¦ the
Southern Pacific officials over yesterday
morning's news was one of surprise. As
to who is to be the nominee of the Spey
ers they all profess Ignorance. Henry E.
Huntington has been first choice in the
yellow building, and many will not be
lieve that the vacant throne of office will
not be yet occupied by him. â¢ V"
General Superintendent Jerome A. Fill
more, who ' returned from Ogden last
night, (lid not desire to have anything
to say on the matter, claiming that he
was as entirely in the dark as anybody
"else.
W. H. Foster, assistant general super
intendent, said: "I do not know any
thing about the matter beyond what I
have read in the newspapers. I certain
ly thought, and so did my colleague, that
H. E. Huntlngton would be the next pres
ident of the road."
T. H. Goodman, general passenger
agent, is inclined to believe that Hunting
ton will still be appointed to assume con
trol of the Southern Pacific, with the
Speyers* nominee as an assistant. "I
think that Huntington will look to the
general I management," said Goodman,
"with possibly an assistant of Speyers'
choosing to attend to details. This would.
T think, produce excellent results, and I
should like to see some such course
adopted." .;,-?::
Thomas' friends were inclined to discredit
it.
Or. the Stock Exchange and throughout
"Wall , street generally the discussion of
Southern Pacific possibilities resolved Into
a mere guessing contest. Practically
every prominent railroad man East of
the Mississippi River was mentioned as a
probable Speyer selection.
Chairman William Salomon of the Balti
more and Ohio, who was formerly a part
ner in the firm of Speyer & Co. and who
was supposed to represent the Interests
of that house and its friends in the Balti
more and Ohio, was generally spoken of.
Mr. Salomon was not in town and no one
at his office has any .knowledge of any
Southern Pacific matter.
Presidents Callaway of the New York
Central, Fowler of the Ontario and West
ern. Newman of the Lake Shore. Trues
dale of the I.ackawanna and Baldwin of
the* Long: Island Kallroad were promi
nently mentioned. Even President Cas
satt of the Pennsylvania came in for a
share of the rumors. Most of these men
denied the stories emphatically.
President Callaway, when seen nt his
summer home at Spring Lak<\ N. J., de
clared that the presidency of the South
ern Pacific had not been offered to him.
and therefore he could not have accepted
It.
President Truesdale of the T^ackawanna
said: "You cannot deny the report too
emphatically; so far as T am concerned
there is Absolutely no truth in it."
President Baldwin of the Long Island
alpo denied that he knew anything of the
report 1 connecting his name with tho
Southern Pacific.
Charles II. Tweed, second vice president
of the Southern Pacific, denied all knowl
edge of the project to select an outsider
to succeed Mr. Huntlngton. He was asked
If he had heard that Mr. Ingalls might be
asked to take the place, and said:
"Oh well, if they've got it all fixed for
Mr. Ingalls "to go In that settles it. But
I have heard nothing of It."
Mn Tweed denied the story printed in a
morning newspaper purporting to give the
results of an appraisal of Mr. Hunting
ton's estate. ' He said no appraisal had
yet been made.
Careers of Candidates.
Melville Ezra Ingalls has been one of
the most prominent figures in Eastern
railroad circles for the last fifteen years
He wa3 born at Harrison. Maine. Septem
ber fi.. 1842: graduated at Bowdoin College,
and in 1SÂ«3 at the Harvard Law School.
Soon after he removed to Boston and be
gan to practice his profession. In 1S67 he
was elected to the State Senate. In 1870
he was elected president and the follow
ing year appointed receiver of the Cin
cinnati and Lafayette Railroad, and by re
organizations in 1S73 and 1SS0 put its suc
cessor, the C, I. St.- L. and Ch.,on a sound
footing, consolidating it with other roads
to form the C. C. C. and St. L. or "Big
Four" system, of which he was elected
president. In October, 1SS8, he was made
president of the C. and O. R. R. Company.
Last year Mr. Ingalls wp.s Invited to be
come the arbitrator for the Pennsylvania,
the. Vanderbllts and the Morgan railroad
interests at a salary 6t $7&,000 per year.
NEW YORK. Aug. 31.â Wall street
was both astonished and puzzled
to-day by the announcement made
In The Call's special London cable
that the Speyer interests have de
cided to put a prominent Eastern railcoad
official not now identified with the system
in the place of the late Collis P. Hunting
ton as president of the Southern Pacific
Company. Tho surprise that neither H.
E. Huntlngton nor Charles II. Tweed, the
present vice presidents of the company.
Is to be chosen for the position was not
greater than the Wall street anxiety to
discover -Ihe name and position of the
man who has been selected.
Speyer & Co. and other Interests Identi
fied with the Southern Pacific manage
ment, however, refused all information on
this subject, maintaining silence as to
what the directors are likely^to do at their
meeting next week. Nor could any In
formation be obtained among the larger
bankers, all of whom denied knowledge of
Southern Pacific plans.
James Speyer refused to make any more
definite statement than that which was
quoted in The Call. When seen at his of
fice he said:
"The new president of the Southern Pa
cific has not been elected yet, and until
he is I do not care to mention names. The
directors will determine who he shall be.' 1
Among well posted railroad officials
President Melville E. Ingalls of the Bis
Four and Vice' President Oscar G. Mur
ray of the Baltimore and Ohio were con
sidered men upon whom the Southern Pa
cjjic presidency v. - ould most likely bo con
ferred. The consensus of opinion was thav
Mr. Murray, who is a practical operating
railroad man and who has wide experience
in all parts of the country, was the one
who had been relected by the Speyer lnter

In a telegram from Williamsport. how
ever, to-night Mr. Murray killed the ru
mors makins use of his name. He said:
"Your telegram is the first intimation I
have received of any rumor about the
Southern Pacific. So far as my name is
concerned there is nothing in it.','
The theory that President Tngalls hafl
been chosen to succeed Mr. Huntington
could not be either confirmed or denied.

Some time ago Mr. Ingalls withdrew
from the Chesapeake and Ohio and since

NEW YORK, Aug. 31.â Richard Croker
took the Bryan end of the heaviest elec
tion bet that has been recorded so far in
the campai&n when he wagered $20,000 to
day apalnst $50,000 wrt.h Louis "W. Wormser
that the Democratic National ticket would
be elected. Â«- /
As Mr. Croker Is not in the habit of
making: wafers unless he thinks there Is
a good chance of winning them news of
his plunge on Bryan caused a sensation
amone the few who were In the secret.
It was known that Mr. Croker had pre
dicted a plurality of 80,000 for Bryan In
Greater New York, but It wao supposed
that he had given this figure merely for
campaign effect. That he was willing to
back his confidence in Bryan's strength
with cash was a surprise to mary per
sons who have regarded McKinley s elec
tion as practically a foregone conclusion.
Mr. Wormser had already wagered a
larce sum upon McKinley*s success at the
sarr.e odds of VA to 1 that governed the
waper made yesterday. He placed $20,000
against $8000 on August 23. Of this sum
$10 COO went to cover J400O put up by L. A.
Cooper of the firm of Cooper. Cramp &
Beadleston. The name of the person w*no
advanced the other $4000 of the Bryan bet
was withheld. The amount of Mr. \Vorm
ser's wagers Is estimated at $200,000.
Mr Wormser had been offering to take
more wagers of the same character and
the odds proved too tempting for the
Tammany chief.

however. In the transaction, the matter

OMAHA, Aug. 3!.â A report reached
Omaha this morning that the bandits
v.ho robbed the Pfuiflo express car at Tip
ton. Wyo.. Wednesday night, had been
overtaken by Marshal HadseU and posse,
and that a terrific battle ensued, in which
one robber and one deputy were seriously
wounded. ; :â¢? Â¦ :. Â¦:Â¦ Â¦Â¦.
The railroad people this evening were
unable to verify the report, but they said
that Ocneral Manager Dickinson wired the
headquarters officials that the officers
were in hot pursuit of the robbers and
hÂ»? felt confident they would be overtaken
before nightfall. However, Mr. Dickin
son said nothinp about the battle report
ed early In the day.
Superintendent R. G. Patterson of the
Pacific Express Company made a vehe
ment .denial of the story that the express
<ar safe contained flOO.OOO. He exhibited
the way bills, covering tlio contents of the
safe and every bit of freight in the car
that was wrecked.
Sai.l Mr. Patterson: '"I figured up the
amount of money in the packages stolen
And state positively and unreservedly that
the amount was less than $lf*). "There
were five packages of Jewelry in the safe,
but we have no means of knowing the
value of the content* of these packages.
I do not think it was very prreat. The
wreckage is the greatest item. Freight
*nd rolling stock damaged incurred a loss
â¢ â¢f about $4<Â«>rt.
"There is no doubt that the men
will bÂ«Â» captured. I saw a. telegram from
Ueneral Manager Dickinson thi? after
noon In which tho latter expressed great
confidence that the men would be run to
earth in a few hours. The bandits have
been tracked toward the mountains of
Eastern Utah and Northwestern Colorado
a locality whiÂ».-h they have infested for
pome time. They are known to be armed
with Winchesters. From the number of
men now se^rchine for the outlaws it
would seem to be impossible for them to
elude their pursuers, who are determined
men. When they do meet it will mean a

MANILA. Aug. 1.â News telling of
battles between bands of rebels
and American soldiers is received
here almost daily. From all rec
kons come reports of skirmishes
with bolomen and hand-to-hand conflicts
between the American soldiers and the
insurgents are very common, the Ameri
cans in almost every instance coming out
of the conflicts with flying colors. It is
rarely Indeed that the Americans are
worsted, and in almost every case the
news of a disaster to American arms is
explained away by a tale of treachery on
the part of trusted Filipino guides. Even
storekeepers are accused of murdering
Americans who have just purchased arti
cles from them. In one instance the pro
prietor of a store was supplying the needs
of three American soldiers when several
bolomen slipped into the store and at
tacked the soldiers from behind, killing a
sergeant, whose head was severed from
his body by one blow. A private was se
verely wounded, but managed to make his
escape. He pave the alarm and a com
pany of the Fortieth Infantry, stationed
at Cagayan. was sent to Oroquieta, the
scene of the trouble. The eoldiery was
backed by a. gunboat, the Callao. which
was dispatched to take a hand in the pro
ceedings.
It seemr that one Vicente Alvarez, the
ex-Insurgent Presidente of Zamboar.ga,
was the ringleader of the insurrectionary
movement in Northern Mindanao. He
had gathered together about 500 renegade*
armed with rifles and bolos and had
boasted of his Intention to exterminate
the Americans. "When the company of
the Fortieth and the Callao reached Oro
quieta 500 rebels were romping through
the town. As the Callao ran in toward
the beach the Insurgents opened fire and
mortally wounded one of her crew. Sup
ported by the fire of the Callao's guns the
men of the Fortieth Infantry entered the
town. They met determined resistance

and a desperate battle ensued. The rebels
could not check the reso'ute advance of
the Americans and were finally driven out
of Oroquieta, a broken, demoralized rab
ble, leaving ninety-four dead behind.
Shells from the Callao set flm to the

For centuries the alchemists, who rep
resent the best of medieval science, be
stirred themselves over their crabbed
scrolls and smoky furnaces to find three
precious thingsâ the universal solvent, the
philosopher's stone and the elixir of life.
Human ideals change slowly, for all the
change in human environment and lan
guage and power, riches and length of
days still represent the secret wisnea of
nine- men out of ten. Bacon, with his
usual sagacity, observed that any one who
professed to have discovered a way of
putting off old age, or of renewing youth,
would not easily be believed. But he add
ed that it was much more likely, to be at
tained by rules which the persevering
study of nature would gradually teach
mankind, than, as the alchemists, who
were unconsciously founding modern
chemistry, still hoped, by means of "a
very few drops, or even scruples, of some
precious llrjuor or quintessence." He was
so far In the fashion, however, as to give
three of the best recipes for the manu
facture of such a liquor, though, with the
proviso that it was rather mind than body
that these cordials were likely to affect.
One consisted of potable gold, which there
Were many approved ways of making: an
other consisted of pearls dissolved in Cleo
patra's manner, or filed down Into a con
serve with ; sweetmeats; a third of pow
dered emeralds and jacinths, about which
he was prudently not very sure ob asperl-
Wbatever might have been the virtues
of such nostrums, one thing Is clearâ they
were hopelessly out of reach of the or
dlnarv man. and If they had been efficient
the universal longevity of the rich would
have developed a more complete plutoc
racy than has yet been known. But none
of them was any good, and It is only in
the New Atlantis that men have yet dis

American Ship St. Paul Beats the
Cunarder Campania, Breaking
Her Record.
NEW YORK. Aug. 31.â After the Ameri
can liner St. Paul reached her dock to
nlpht the passengers told of a great race
the liner had made \ytth the CQnarder
Campania. They said -the interest in the
race was so great that nearly- all the pas
sengers remained awake Thursday night
and until dawn Friday morning. On
Thursday evening before nightfall the
Campania was sighted about 500 miles out
and was then ahead of the St. Paul by
about four miles. . A race was inevitable.
The St. Paul made a burst of speed and
steadily forged ahead. The nerves of
every passenger and of the crew were
keyed to the straining point. The interest
in the race continued while the vessels
were in sight of one another, but before
dawn the St. Paul was so far ahead that
the Campania could not be seen. The St.
Paul was at her dock when the Campania
anchored at quarantine for the night.
The St. Paul made the passage from
Southampton* and Cherbourg in six days
seven hours and six minutes. This time
Is the best mafle by the St. Paul between
this port and Cherbourg and beats the
best time of the big fleet of ocean grey
hounds plying between Cherbourg and
this port, with the one exception of the
present record holder, the Kaiser Wilhelm
der Grosse, whose time is five days, sev
enteen hours and thirty-seven minutes.

K. J. LIcQuaide and Thomas Hamilton
next hove on the scene, but did not re
main In evidence long. Hamilton made
three rapid feints at McQuaide and hyp
notized him. He then administered the
"coup de grace" to McQuaide and the lat
ter dropped to the floor. "Doc" Flynn,
who v.as seconding the beaten man. was
so disgusted that he threw a wet sponge
at him. The missile struck the knocked
out fighter flush in the mouth and he re
vived with a suddenness that left a feel
ing in the minds of the spectators that he
"lay-down."
The "event of the evening" was a dis
appointment. Billy Foster and Oscar Wil
son were to have gone four rounds, but
when half the journey was reached Fos
ter found that he had a sufficiency and
dropped to the floor. His lack of game
ness did not win him favor with the
crowd and he was roundly hooted.
James "Fuzzy" Little was to have given
battle to Frank Wall, but the latter de
veloped a cold in his lower extremities
and stayed, away. Frank Herman was
substituted, but proved a sorry one. Lit
tle punched him at his own pleasure and
In the second round Gr^ggains humanely
stopped the bout, awarding the medal lo
Little.
"Kid" Finnerty was outpointed and out
slogged by George Fuller, and Fuller was
awarded a decision near the close of the
fourth round, when he had Finnerty at
his mercy.
The best battle of the night was fought
by Hush Friel and Joe Brown. They both
weighed 120 pounds and were as evenly
matched as two peas. For the first three
rounds "Brick" Friel had a shade the
better of it. In the fourth Brown, who
was goaded on by his seconds, rushed
things and had his rival guessing. An
extra round was called and at its close
the referee could not pick a winner, 'ihe
fight -was declared a draw and the de
cision gave universal satisfaction.
J. Welsh and J. Donovan were next to
enter the ring, and they settled their dif
ferences without arbitration. Before the
round was half over Welsh knocked his
rival down and out with two heavy rights
on the Jaw.
Abe Attel and Joe Leary opened the
evening's entertainment.* The former was
a chunky broth of a boy. but he went Into
his tall opponent with a will and at thÂ«
end of four rounds of hard and fast fight-
Ins was given a merited decision by Ref
eree Greg-gains. The lads went the four
rounds at great speed and each received
and administered punches which hurt.
James Jones and Ed Savage went at
each other like cats on a back fence. They
fought each other to a standstill and both
were f?rogf?y in every round they ba.ttled.
The fighting was so even and both were
so willinstthat an extra round was, called,
and evert then a winner could not be
chosen. A draw met the approval of the
crowd.

Hawkins* blows* seemed to carry the
more steam and It looked a? if the col
ored boxer would po down. He steadied
himself, however, and with a s^harp right
hook to the jaw stretched Dal on the
floor. There was no need for a count, as
I >a4 was so far pone that he did not re
cover for several minutes after being car
ried to his corner. Ga.nÂ« himself could
hardly Ftard nnd looked to he ready to
drop when he landed the lucky blow.
They started the third with a rush and
Dal reached Joe's head with a sharp left
to the jaw, but Gans repaid him a mo
ment later with a h:?rd risrht on the Jaw.
Oans then cornered Da! and Ttoth started
to slu^ with both hands. For fully a
minute they never moved from the spot
where they started ajid bo vicious was the
fghtinp that the crowd was on its feet
in a perfect frenzy of excitement.
Both fought carefully in the opening
round. Hawkins tried repeatedly for the
head.. but Cans' blocking was perfect and
not many punches were landed other than,
a few swings to the stomach of Hawkins.
In the second the men warmed to their
work and each scored heavily on the
head. Both missed repeatedly in their anx
iety to land, but the round ended in Haw
kins' favor because of his superior work
to the body, which seemed to worry Gans.
Both men were at the required weight
and each looked t,o be in g-ood condition
vi hen they entered the ring.

State Commissioners Say That W. F. \
Ihrnlevy of Alameda. Is an In
eflacient Officer.
Sportsmen In Alameda County, and this
cittf, too, for that matter, are considerably
Interested in the charges filed by the
State Fish and Game Commissioners
against W. S. Dunlevy. the game warden
across the bay. Dunlevy i3 accused of
being 1 either Incompetent or neglectful of
his duties, or both. The accusations are
based upon the many complaints made by
people living In Alameda County who are
interested in the preservation of gams.
According to the statement of Secretary
J. P. Babcock, scarcely a week passes but
from one to a dozen people visit the San
Francisco office and tell of violations of
the law across the bay, and In every in
stance they assert that Dunlevy declines
to attend to his duties.
Commissioner Gould says the Commis
sioners have no choice of warden for Ala
meda County, but thev want a man who
will "attend to his duties. He says the
Legislature in providing for county scamp
wardens did so in order to relieve the
State Board of a larse amount of work.
It Is for the protection of game in the
several counties that the wardens are
allowed a salary of $100 and $25 for ex
penses.
The hearing In the Dunlevy matter will
come up before the Alameda Supervisors
next Tuesday eveniner and the Commis
sioners will be present to prosecute the
matter.

The date of the celebration is near at hand. There
is little time left for extensive canvassiiie. The
ptnoiint asked for by the committee is not excessive
when the dignity of the occasion and the wealth and
magnitude of the city are taken into consideration
We are rejoicing in ?n abundant prosperity and all
prospects justify the conclusion that even brighter
times await us. Every circumstance of the situation
therefore tends to prompt to liberality in providing
for the fete. We have an opportunity to demonstrate
to the whole country the wealth of California and ths
State patriotism of her people and we should do it on
a scale that wiil make California the talk of the nation
for months to come.
rUJROM the committee in charge of the fina- 'ial
} part ot the work ot providing for the celebnttioT
of Admission day comes the announcement that,
notwithstanding the liberality with which many citi
zens have contributed, there is still need of more
money to defray the expense of the elaborate and
splendid display that has been devised ior the several
<iays of the festival. Therefore it is timeiy to once
njore urge upon all progressive citizens who have not
yet subscribed to the fund to do so at once. It is a
matter which concerns all and all in proportion to
their means should promptly respond.

It ir th be bOrne in mind that the room? and offices
in. the City .Hall nowused by. the Police .Department
end the. Police Courts, the City Prison and probably
the Receiving Hospital, will soon be vacant by reason
In the preamble to his resolution Braunhart sets
forth first, that "the City Hall roof by reason of a
wrong system of construction is continually cracking,
necessitating constant repairs and expenditure of
money for the purpose of preventing leakage." and
second, that there is "a growing demand for library ac
commodations. : both for the Free Public and Law
libraries, which are wholly inadequate for the present
requirements of these institutions:" third, that "the
original design of the building contemplated a man
sard roof to be constructed, which for beauty and
utility is considered 'most desirable for the present
contingency." . .
Such nre the specious reasons assigned for opening
the way for a new career of City Hall jobbery. As for
the lenkasre of the roof, it is to be borne in mind that
all large roots leak. That on the City Hall has not
leaked worse than others. Xo extensive repairs have
been necessary upon it since it was put in place. The
construction is that '.vhichis most' approved by good
architects and is. generally iKed in fireproof build
inp;s. In.SHcha.r90f when leaks occur they are read
ily discovered and easily remedied. . As for the claim
that the. Public- Librorv requires better and larger
accommodation?; that will be .concerted, by all. but
few will favor the scheme that has been proposed for
increasing them. San Francisco ought to have a
Public 'Library. .- building, but there is. nothing in that
feet tq' justify a", mansard roof onthe City Hall.
The people of San Francisco; have had. ample ex
perience Â¦iri City Hail construction. .The building was
begun long ago : and its course has been marked by
about every form of waste and fraud known '.to the
financiering of politicians. Therefore, when the prop
osition is:made to have. the roof taken off the build
ing so ?s to reopen it for. new jobs in the erection
upon it of a loftier roof, the protest of the taxpayers
is likely to be sharp, k'ud and earnest.

Hardly any of the many evidences of increasing
public spirit and State patriotism which are now ap
parent among the people i? more encouraging than
this! The California State Fair ought to be an an
nual exposition of the- industrial achievements and
progress of the Pacific: Coast and one of the most
notable expositions of the Union. : Before that can be
attained, hbwever, it must first be made thoroughly
representative of all California. Counties and pro
ducers who neglect to take advantage of its many
opportunities for acquiring benefit stand in their own
light. All are taxed to; provide an appropriation for
the. fair and all should share in the a4vantages it of
fers. It is truly "our fair" for all Californians and it
is gratifying to learn that the people of all sections
have begun to speak of it as such.
The; -wholesome change which in this respect i?
coming over, the people of the State has been noted
bv the Record-Union, which, in commenting upon it,
said recently: "We have not in many years seen .so
many and approving announcements of the State Fair
as j now appear in the interior press. . Very many of
the papers -'jspeak of the fair exposition as 'our State
Fair,' a designation not before used. It is evident
that a better understanding of the character and pur
poses of the annual State Exposition is growing up
and a broader and less seotronal view is taking the
place of what. before largely was injustice and miscon
ception concerning this annual event."
I ?ItH the grov/inii; improvement of the State
\A/ Fair there has coittc as a natural consequence
*" a growing interest in it among the people of
all parts of the. State. It is rapidly becoming an in
stitution in. which State ipride finds an occasion for
manifesting itself. In many localities where the fair
was at; one time regarded as a Sacramento enter
prise, or a racing meeting mainly, the people are now
beginning to perceive that it is a genuine State Fair
and that within its scope is included the promotion
and improvement of every form of industry known to
bur civilization.'

soda in one pound cans, seven or eight
cans to eighty or ninety gallons of water.
If the lye is not strong enough to cut the
prunes properly I put in more." He says
"Be sure to have the lye boiling all the
time, and rinse the prunes in clean water
afterward. Use the lye but one day if &
considerable quantity of prunes are

WATER and forest conservation is a matter of
so great and so immediate importance to the
people of California that every evidence of an
increasing interest in the subject is a cause for grati
fication. It is not to be expected that the earlier sug
gestions as" to the best means of dealing with the
problem will receive the assent of a majority of the
people, nevertheless, all suggestions of a definite char
acter are timely and valuable inasmuch as they tend
to provoke discussion and assist in that campaign of
education which must precede the adoption of a set
tied policy of action.
The increased thoughtfulness of the people on the
"subject is made evident by the increasing number of
contributions to the discussion from persons in all
parts of the State. One of the more notable of these
is embodied in a letter to the Sacramento Record-
Union by Samuel M. Coppin of Pleasant Grove. His
letter deals with the conservation of water for irriga
tion purposes in the Sacramento Valley and is a plei
for united effort on the part. of the residents of the
valley to provide a comprehensive system of storing
the flood waters of the mountain streams.
A FLEfl FOF^ IRRIGATION.
Prominent Instructor in the Department Gives His Reasons for De
claring the Present Board Unworthy of Public Trust.
THE teachers in the public schools of San Francisco have become aroused over the recital which The Call has

â¢ t_- 1 r 11 â¢ r , miMipr ni nrominence in the department. While it is not the policy ot ine
- ssssssss IP i^^S i
eTk it An expose of School Board methods as a teacher in the department sees them is as follows:
SAN FRAXCISCO. Cal., Aug. 31, 1900.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I have
noticed that you have been disposed to
give the teachers of San Francisco jus
tice, so I have presumed to ask for a lit
tle space in your valuable paper.
First, I wish to call attention to the
standing of the teacher in law. The State
law gives the Board of Education the
power to elect teachers into the depart
ment under certain conditions. He must
Obtain a certificate which entitles him
to teach in certain grades-that is, In pri
mary, grammar or high schools. Hav
ing been elected and having been granted
a certificate upon credentials or examina
tion, the Board of Education has the
power or authority to assign him work.
The teacher having been elected, having
obtained a certificate and having beep
assigned work becomes possessed of cer
tain valuable rights. The law plainly
states that he cannot be dismissed v.ith
out cause and specifies the cause. This
clause has been interpreted in a number
of cases to mean that a teacher in the
San Francisco public schools cannot be
degraded in salary or position. The rea
son Is evident, for if any degree of con
solidation or degradation should oe per
mitted It would nullify the law. If a
power of attorney abuses his privilege the
principal is held responsible; if a Board
of Education elects too many teachers,
the city Is responsible. To permit
the consolidation of one teacher out
of work, would permit the consolidation
of any teacher out of his positiop; It
would mean the restoration of that per
nicious system "to the victor belong the
spoils." The law does not erant the
Board of Education the power to con
solidate out the poorest teacher, the last
teacher sent to a certain school, the old
est teacher, or ; the teacher recommended
to be consolidated out by any .principal,
but It specifically names the causes and
gives the teacher the privilege of de
fense,' and until he' is dismissed accord
ing to law the teacher is entitled ' to all
the privileges of his position, one . of
which is his salary.
Teachers Robbed of Their Salaries.
The present board and its predecessor
have consolidated out a large number of
teachers. Some teachers have been out
of work nearly two years, others less.
Xew teachers have been elected. Evi
dently all these teachers are entitled to
their salaries, and any court of justice
will give them judgment for It. The
salaries due those teachers probably
amount to J73.00O or more. ' Each year in
creases the sum that much or more.
"What they may earn in the meanwhile
will not more than pay their lawyers'
fees, as they have to sue on a percentage '
basis. It requires about three years to
obtain an opinion from the Supreme
Court.
Now if the teachers win in all these
casps, one of three things will happen: A
largt-r tax levy will have to be made, the
t<-a.chf:rs' salaries diminished, or those
who have suffered the burden of these
lawsuits will lose the most important
part, their salaries.
The Board Unworthy of Trust.
The Board of Education should not be
blamed for demanding every privilege of
their office, but it should be done in such
a manner that no one should suffer.
When by due process of law any one can
obtain his rights, but instead does it In
a manriVr that causes tne most sacrifice*,
no censure is too severe. The Board of
Education at all times has been in a po
sition where by a test case every doubtful
question could have been settled by the
courts without in the least causing any

Outrages of Board Discrimination.
Notwithstanding an adverse decision In

pending an appeal to the Supreme Court;
notorious breakers of the law. as pool

always permitted to continue their busi
ness until final judgment la rendered on
the plea o? means of a livelihood; but tho
teacher Is deprived of his means of a live
lihood without any notification, without
any hearing whatever. He 13 not even
given the same prlvilegr-? of the worst
criminal. The criminal Is held m cus
tody, but given his board ar.d lodging,
while the teacher is deprived of his means
of a livelihood without any aid. I ask. I3
it right, is It just. Is it the law of the
land, ia it the will of the people of San
Francisco that a corporation, that a pool
seller, that a taloonkeeper, that a dive
keeper, that the enemy of the people, that
the enemy of honesty, that the enemy o"
the home, that the enemy of virtue, that
the devil himself shall be allowed to gath

Investments in nefariou3 practices, with
the law of the land against it, while the

A Plea for Justice.
The one takes his inheritance and fn
vests It In -what leads to destruction 01
what Is good, and on the plea that ar.y In
terference destroys the means of a liveli
hood Is permitted to continue in business
pending the court's decisions. The other
Invests his capital la an education and,
with the law for him, wants for the neces
sities cf l'fe while he remains at the mercy
of -the court, the Eoard of Kducation and
the devil.
Mr. Editor. The Call has a yreat Influ
ence and has exerted it for the right.
Won't you try to devise some method by
which these teachers can come into their
rishts without incurring the enmity of
the board and their principals of schools
and sacrificing a large percentage of their
salaries? By so doinp I am sure you
would have the good will of the teachers.
Yours truly, A TEACHER.

General Wood said in his speech, which unquestion
ably represented the wishes of President McKinley,
that the immediate future of Cuba is independence
and therefore beeped of them to sink, personal and
party differences and passions and elect men to the
constitutional convention renowned for honor and
capacity and competent to draft a constitution. He
added impressively: "I 'care not what your party poli
tics, but. for the .present, party considerations must
be suspended -for the sake of the gr-eat end in view;
the end that will make history and affect the welfare
of all Cuban people. Avoid making Cuba a second
Hayti. You want liberty for all and/for no particular
party. The United' States insists that you shall have
it. This is. easily possible. We have, said it to the
world. It lies with you to. help us to make bur word
good. Your enemies predict your failure. The peo
ple of the. : United States and their representatives hope
to see you defeat their predictions. If we were not
your friends we would, not seek the best men you
have, but rather the disturbers and the malcontents
to represent you 'in the constitutional convention.
We seek and demand the best you have. ' Apain I
say. send' people to Â»he convention who will make
vour political system workable and permanent.".. ; -
a result of such resistance Cuba is not burdened with
several hundred millions of bonds which were placed
among American politicians ami newspapers. 7 but is
able to bepin in earnest the work of self-government
\\ ith a clean daybook and ledger. The people of the
island have everything cleared away and are face to
face with an election cf members of a convention to
draft a national constitution. Considering the cir
cumstances, commendable progress has been made.
Our American revolution bepan. formally, in 1776.
War did not end until 1783 and the constitution was
not made and the Union formed until 17S9. So it
took r.s thirteen years to reach a point at which Cuba
finds herself in less than half that time. Ail parties
ir. the island seem impressed with the solemn import
ance of their responsibility. They have recently com
bined in banqueting General Wood, our military rep
resentative there. The greatest good feeling prevailed
and thousands of people surrounded the building
where the banquet was held and cheered as the
speeches were passed out to them by interpreters.
AT last Cuban affairs are getting through the
mare and out of the confusion in which they
have been so long involved. The lurid writers
and speakers who urged the couatry into the Spanish
war were guilty of wholesale and retail misrepresenta
tion of the Cuban situation.. They told the country
that there was a Cuban Government in full operation,
under a constitution like our own. with an ex
chequer, a revenue law. public schools and school
books printed by the Government and in all respects
ready and able to discharge its domestic and inter
national duties. A variety of motives joined in the
making of this utterly false declaration. The major
among them seems to have been greed. Cuban bonds
had been emitted by the junta in New York and if the
fiction of a government could have been set up behind
these bonds its recognition would have validated them
and made them a lien on the revenues of the island.
It is worth while to remember now that Mr. Bryan
ni ged the recognition of that mythical government as
a part of the declaration of war against Spain. But it
was successfully resisted by President MrKinley. As

TEACHERS BEG FOR PROTECTION
FROM SCHOOL BOARD OUTRAGES
The various organizations of the city which have
been formed to protect the interests of the taxpayers
and to prevent the wiste of money needed for genuine
improvements should give their attention to this job
at once. It will be money in their pockets and a
benefit to the municipality to crush the scheme
ptomptly.
of the removal of those branches of the municipal ad
ministration to the Hall of Justice. With that addi
tional space available it will be quite easy and con
venient to give an increase of office room to the
libraries and the departments tlhtt are to remain lo
cated in the City Hall. \
We repeat it is not easy to estimate how much the
job will amount to when all is done. The advocates
of the scheme promise that the mansard roof can be
put in place for something like Sjoo.ooo. There are
other authorities who calculate the cost at more than
Sr.ooo.ooo. Experience shows that in municipal work
the highest estimate is always nearest the truth.

The ingenuity exercised by several recent suicides
suggests that there may be somewhere a code of the
latest fads in the art of self-murder.
The recent baseball contest at the Presidio between
civilians and soldiers demonstrated at least that the
bluecoats are more expert- at smashing heads than
balls. â¢;' .
There appears to b- a reasonably pood chance that
seme of the Herrin. Kelly and Crimmins followers
may be landed in jail. It would be difficult to suggest
a more appropriate place for their permanent resi
dence. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
The Oakland burglars who were lighted at their
work by the lights of the city's police station must
hnyc been inspired by some purpose more sinister,
than a desire for plunder. Thej' ought to make good

Several months ago a number of promi

Tieps men of this city .with the, Object of
establishing here ,a Pacific Coast commer
cial museum after the planof the big In
stitution in Philadelphia. An 'executive
committee '.was formed, "composed ..of
Mayor Phelan. Irving M. Scott. President
Wheeler of the State University, A. A.
Wat kins of the Board of Trade, E. Good
win of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association, R. P. Jennings and others,
for the purpose of canvassing the city and
State for members. It was decided that
at least 180 firms as members would be
necessary to start the movement on a
fair financial basis. The committee has
been doing hard work and now the re
quired number has been obtained, v ;
At a meeting of the committee on Fri
day the conclusion was arrived at that It
is time to begin the actual work. Under
the plan suggested and indorsed by the
general committee, the next move will bÂ«
to form a board of governors. This will
be done at a meeting to be held on Sep
tember 13,- which will be called by Presi
dent Wheeler. At that gathering the
work so far accomplished Will be reported
and everything turned over to the board
of governors to be then chosen. Those
interested feel assured that the Pacific

numbered and has a little history kept
for it all to Itself. Tlie number is branded
upon the animal's hind feet â the thou
sands on the near hjnd foot and the units,
tens and hundreds on the off hind foot.

arily be the sight of a lifetime.
A number of San FrancJsco business
men, after carefully looking over the
ground, decided that the Recreation
grounds at Sixteenth and Folsom streets
would be an ideal place for such an en
tertainment. It is a well known fact that
when the rest of the city is enveloped in
heavy wet sea fog the belt in which these
grounds are located is entirely free from
the disturbing element. With this fact
in mind they have given Henrv J. p a in
known all over the world as "Tho fire
works King," a heavy guarantee for four
toon performances of his ejpen air military
spectacle. "The Battle of San Juan Hill 'â¢

COIvONEI. WII,I.IAM R. PARNEI.L,
pecrotary of the California Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, has -eslgned in order to
liecome profr^Ffsor of military science and
tactlos at St. Matthr-Ws Military School at

keenly regret his resignation, âfor during
The paÂ«t throe and. a half years hV has
filled the position of : secretary : Colonel
I'arnoll has made hosts of friends for. the
organization. l*he appointment of Colonel
Parntll was a matter of short considera
tion. He received a dispatch from the
Secretary of War informing him that his
services had been sought by the president
of the military school and inquiring as to
his wishes. The offer being a favorable
one, it was accepted, and the Se^fretarv
of War immediately made out an order
ior Colonel Parnell to assume his new
duties on September S. - :
The new professor -Is. eminently fitted
fcr the position he i? to assume. Ills early
*-rtucation was at West Point, and upon
the breaking out of the Civil War he en
tered the Union army a? lieutenant in
the Fourth New York- Volunteer
Cavalry. He took active part in
mai;y of the noted battles and
wears scars in consequence. By the
end of the war he had worked himself
along the line of promotion until he earnr-d
the title of lieutenant colonel. At the
close cf the war Colonel Parnell chose to
remain with the army and he has held
Important positions ever since, most of
Ms commands being: on the frontier. Many
years of his life werp rpent fighting In
diar.s in Oregon. Washin.^ton. Idaho and
!:is campaign in the Bud Land? is an im
portant one in thr military history of
Indian fichtinK. Colonel ParnHl Vas re
tired frnm active service in 1SS7, subject
of course to orders from the superior offi
cers of the army. It is doubtful if his
Fuccrspor in the children's society will be
appointed for Feme time, as the directors
desire to obtain only a man thorouehiv
alive to this peculiar work.

and confined in the post guardhouse un

t-toxred away on tlie transport Thomas
two days after the ship left Nagasaki.
Miller is a deserter, as the term jroes, but
his desertion was accomplished at great
risk to himself. Ho participated in the
battle of Tientsin and behaved as one of
Uncle Sam's boys in blue should. His
comrades* were faliinz ail around him,
but he escaped unscalhnd.
Picking up a wounded comrade" he tra
versed the bloody lield and deposited him
in a place of safety. Returning to the
firing; line once agrain he was enabled to
help a follow soldier and placed a sep-jnd
victim of tho "Gherio" bullets wherw he
could not be struck again No fear of the
bullets .'oil Miller, but he simply decided
that he had had enough, and he continued
his march to the rear. Knowing that he
had unaJterably ruined bis career as a
soldier, notwithstanding his brave deeds,
he was compelled to remain in hiding, and
peized a chance offered to return to this
country. He stowed away on thfe return
ing transport, but was discovered two
days out. He Â»was confined in the brig
during the rest of the voyage and yester
day was sent to the Presidio, where a
court-martial will decide his fate.

London waiters and waitresses have or

and now demand 25 cents an hour for reg
ular work, 35 cents an hour for all over
eight hours and 50 cents an hour between
1 and 6 o'clock In the mornrtig. and no
waiter to work over ten hours a day. An
ultimatum protests against "the degrad
ing and demoralising system of tips, upon
which the waiters have to depend. It is a
system of cadging which destroys our
manhood, is an unfair tax upon the public
and, places the poor man at a disad
vantage in public places."

It is a curious lecend. and one would
like to know whether the folklore has
anything to say to it, whether there is
any. explanation of the reason why the
souls prefer embarking in Holland and
iri Brittany; how It is they cannot navi
gate their own ships: how it Is that in
visible and impalpable' shades still pre
serve their weight? 'And. one would much
like to talk with some of the.Â«e .fishermen

summons, and to. ascertain the namesof

hear a voice which announces their ar

them. The voice proclaims their rank
andtheir offlces: "Caractacus, late Kins

For really colossal smokers you must go
to Belgium and Holland. The population
of Belgium Ih a little larger than the pop
ulation of London, being .about 6.250,000.
One would think from the returns that the
Belgian infants were reared on tobacco.
If we consider every soul In Belgium as n
smoker, we get the astounding average
of &7 ounces per: soul each year. When,
however, we reduce the population to the
probable census of males of an age to
smoke, we get an average amount of 22^
pounds a year per man, or a weekly con
sumption of V\ ounces.
Holland, with its 5.075.000 inhabitants,
comes second in the smoking world. There
is, however, some excuse for the Dutch
prnoUing so much, for their tobacco Is
very mild and. of a pleasant flavor. Nev
ertheless, a yearly average of seventy
ounces per man must be considered ab
normal, and the English anti-tobacconist
has Â»Â»very reason to re.ioicp that he does
r.ot live under Queen W'ilhclminn.
What do all these people smoke? Well,
putting it roughly, tho consumption of to
bacco in France Is chiefly In the shape of
cigarettes and cigars. In Russia the ci
garette is also, unfortunately, too popu
lar. No one in Holland or Belgium would
thank, you for the paper-covered car
tridges which the British soldier desig
nates as "two puffs and a spit." The pipe
predominates in Germany, Holland and
Belgium. Austria and England are im
partial. The cigarette appeals .to some,
the cigar to the wealthy and the pipe
maintains its popularity. During the past
six- years tho : consumption of cigarettes
has almost doubled, and this. is not good
for the nation at large, though it may be
for. the revenue and the- tobacconists. â

Edgar Poe was born In Boston January
13; ] 809 .'the second son of David Poe. a
Baltimore gentleman who had abandoned
the bar for the stage and married a young
English actress. David Poe died, appa
rently in 1810, and his wife passed away
a year later inÂ» utter destitution, leaving
three young children. Â¦ .
Edgar, then nearly three years of age,
was adopted by a Mr. Allan, a wealthy
merchant of Richmond, whose young and
childless wife peems to have been an ad
mirer, of the unfortunate actress. The
boy was given the name of his adopted
parents, treated as an only child and ap
parently spoiled in the good old Southern
fashion. When six years old he was taken
to England by the Allans and spent five
years in a London school, a vivid picture
of which he has preserved for us In "Wil
liam Wilson.". On his return he continued
his studies in Richmond and in 1826 en
tered the University of Virginia. Here
he spent but one term. The general tes
timony of his schoolmates is that he was
a lonely and moody lad. plunging at times
Into the dissipations of the college boys,
but-by no means neglecting his studies â
he took the highest honors in French and
Latinâ and devoting much time to litera
ture. At the end of the term Mr. Allan
visited Charlottesvllle and paid the large
bills which the boy had run up. but re
fused to acknowledge hia "debts of
honor" and angrily withdrew him from
the university. Griswold's Btatement that
Poe was expelled is an absolute falsehood:
he was never even censured by the fac
ulty, and though drinking and gambling
are not exactly commendable habits In a
'boy of 1(5 they were at least the vices of
a Southern gentleman.
Mr Allan placed Pop In his counting
house but he did not stay there long. !p
the spring of the following year. 1S27. we
find him In Boston arranging for the pub
lication of a volume of verse, the product
of his school and college days. This was
"Tamerlane and Other Poems, by a Bos
tonian " now one of the rarest of Ameri
can books. Even before It appeared Poe.
probably at his wits' end for money, en
listed in the United States army as a pri
vate under the name of Edgar A. Perry.
Tie served for two years, was promoted
for merit and at his discharge received
high testimonials from his commanding
officers. Poe seems to have been ashamed
of this episode, and in the account he was
accustomed to give of his life filled up
these years with a fictitious expedition to
aid the cause of Greek freedom. Shortly
before his discharge Mrs. Allan died, and
her widower's one thought seems now to
have been to rid himself as decently as
possible of the lad whom he had adopted
and reared as his only child and heir. In
a letter to the Secretary of War asking
for a cadet's post at West Point for Poe.
he expre?3ly disclaims all relationship and
ranks the boy among "the numerous ob
jects of K]s charity.
While waiting for his appointment Poe
published a second volume of poetry, "Al
Aaraaf Tamerlane and Minor Poems."
this time under hi? own name. In'July.
1S30 he entered West Point, and in Octo
ber of the same year Mr. Allan married a
, second time. Poe probably looked upon
this step as practically disinheriting him.
and feeling that he. was left to make his
own way in the world he determined to
leave the mlltary academy and devote
himself to literature. Mr. Allan refused to
sanction his resignation. from West Point,
and he was In consequence compelled to
procure his discharge by means of a rourt
mnrtial. He neglected all military duties
and was In consequence dismissed In the
spring of 1831. leaving the post, it is said,
with ony 12 cents in his pocket.
Poe's stay at West' Point was by no
means the round of dissipation that it has
been represented. Some work hÂ«* must
have done, for he stood third in French
and seventeenth in mathematics out of a
class of eighty-seven. His neglect of
parade and roll callâ the charge on which
he was dismissed â was the result of his
determination to escape from the army In
the only way that was open to him. Even
at this time it Is hard to imagine Poe.
with his wild fancies, quick artistic in
stincts and thirst for poetic fame, bound
down in the shackles of military routine.
His mistake, one would think, was not In
leaving but in ever entering West Point.
The next two years of Poe's life are al
most a blank. Supported by the subscrip
tion of his cadet- friends he brought out
a third volume of verse, in which for the
first time we catch the note of that haunt
ing lyric that -was so peculiarly his own.
"To Helen." "The City In the Sea" and
"Israfcl." which appeared for the first
time in this volume, were and are unique
contributions to American literature. Poe
seems to have spent the greater part of
these years In abject poverty in Balti
more. He received. It apears. a scanty
annuity from Mr. Allan, but when he
emerges from that period of obscurity he

Half a century has elapsed since Edgar
Allan vPoe passed out from the "fever
called. -living" and. "drank of the river
that- quenches all thirst." Over his dead
body friend and foe have fought fiercely
and uneerisinKly, but even to-day the story
of his life remains to be. told. Accuracy
and. sympathy, the two indispensable pre
requisites of the biographer, have never
yet been. united In a biography of this
most unfortunate of American poets.
Shortly after the deliberate malignity of
a clerical hack sought to avenge an old
quarrel by a base betrayal of the trust
committed to him and this treachery
proved only too successful, for "Gris
wold's Memoir," for the most part false
as to fact and always rancorous as to
eplrit, has served as the basis for the
common conception of Poe. It was in vain
that the dead poet's friends protested at
tho time against the savage caricature.
The. world Is always ready to believe the
worst of a man of genius and there was
unfortunately much In Poe*3 life to lend
credibility to the assertions of his ma
llgner. Sincethen other writers, foreign
ers:'for the most part â to our shame be It
saidâ have attempted to present the char
acter of Poe In a more favorable' light
and to-day there Is no country but our
own where his fate Is not pitied and his
achievement In prose and verse acknowl
edged. But with us the latest biographies,
Fatlier ;. Â¦; Oullebr : ; - Presided VOyerV the

V : V;-^;^and -'Helped ~. the: : ;.Go6d-'' u â¢!"Â¦:- =â¢ -. ,'Â¦
Noteâ This study, by Dr. T. M. Parrott
of Princeton University, will be concluded
on Saturday next.
But Griswold's statement that "Poe was
dismissed for drunkenness Is Quite un
true. A letter from the proprietor of th<?
Messenger remonstrating with PoÂ« for
hl3 lack of self-control was written, anl
Griswold knpw that it was written, t*forÂ»
Poe assumed his editorial functions. The
probable truth Is that Poo was at onc<?
desirous to rnter the hroader fields cf
Journalism in Xew York and. to quit a city
where his numerous acquaintances and
the "spirit of Southern conviviality" *o
multiplied temptation. At any ra't*. he
quitted Richmond in tlÂ»tÂ» spring of 1?37.
I certainly did give way at long Intervals to
the temptation held out on all sides by th
epirit of Southern conviviality. My sensitive
temperament cotiirt not vtand an excitement
which was an everyday matter to my compan
ions. In short. It* sometimes happened that I
was completely intoxicated. For iomÂ« days
after each excess I was invariably confined to
bed.
During his stay In Richmond Pop mar
ried secretly, though with her mother Â»
consent, his little cousin. Virginia Clpmm.
a child of 13. It was some months hofr.re
she and her mother came to live with him
at Richmond, and during this time ha
seems to have given way repeatedly to
the craving for drinkâ a family falling. If
we may judge from a Mfer of hia cousin.
"William Poe. Years afterward Poe. while
denying the habit of Intoxication, said
of this period:
is on the point of starvation and unabls
to accept an Invitation to dinner for lack
of a decent coat. But his poverty la not
to be attributed, as is so frequently done,
to intemperance. Wllmer, who knew him
intimately at the close of this period, saw
no sign of bail habits in Poe except that
on one occasion the aunt with whom he
lived upbraided him. but a.s though ic
were a rare occurrence, for havinsj taken
too much at a tavern dinner. Cast off by
Mr. Allan, who was rapidly begetting a
family of his own, and without aid or
sympathy from hia father's relatives, Poe
set himself steadily to perfect a new form
of art which might perhaps bring him in
the pittance needed for his daily bread.
This was the short story, and it was by
this that he flm came into prominence.
In the autumn of 1S33 the Baltimore Sat
urday Visitor offered a prize of $1000 for
the best prose story and another of i~>0
for the best short poem. Poe seized the
opportunity and presented one of hli
beautifully -written manuscripts contain
ing six stories and a poem. Griswold has
given currency to the silly tale that a
careless committee awarded the prize to
"the first of seniuses who had written
legibly." One had but to compare the
simple, lucid style, the amazing realism
and the wild imacinatton of "The MS.
Found In a Bottle" with the feeble Insip
idity of the average magazine story to
concur in the unanimous decision of the
committee. His poem also would have re
ceived the prize had U not for some rea
son been thought injudicious to give both
awards to one competitor."
Poe's life as a man cf letters really be
gins with the winning of this prize. All
hope of Inheriting a portion of Mr. Allan's
estate was cut short op. the death of that
gentleman, who. shortly before his do
cease, had driven Poe from his house with
threats of personal violence. The young
writer wag taken up, however, by John
Kennedy, one of the Judges who hai
awarded him the prize and himself a man
of letters. Through his good offices Poe
obtained some employment on the Satur
day Visitor and later a position on thu
editorial staff of tho Southern Llterarv
Messenger, a monthly magazine just
started at Richmond. Here PoÂ» remained
for something over a year, filling his post
with such sucrep3 that he raised the cir
culation of the magazine from 700 tn
over 50)0 subscribers. He contributed both
firose and poetry and attracted particu
ar attention hy the brilliancy, indepen
dence and severity of his literary criti
cism. Such a dissection of a popular novel
as Poe inflicted on Fay's "N'nrman Les
lie." the best "puffed" book of thÂ»Â» day,
had never been seen in America before.

NEW TORK, Aug. 31.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Distributive trade, that from
Jobbers particularly, increases aa the vaca
tion season :wanes. Reports from leading
Westers centers are more favorable and a
large aggregate of business in dry goods, clotU
ing, shoes, hats and : hardware are . features
noted this week. The iron and steer trade, too.
notes a decided gain in tone and volume of
sal's, though prices, except in a few Instances,
harden but slowly. Cleaxings, reflecting past
business and dormant speculation, are very
small, but railroad earnings, reflecting the
really heavy actual . movement into consump
tion, maintain their old gains. Relatively the
most quiet and leant Â«a.tisfactory conditions
rule in the primnry textile markets of th?
East, reflecting the backward state of next
spring's business. Corn crop advices are
viewed as rather better because of the ending
of the late dry hot spell at-the West. Cotton
crop conditions are still, however, only par
tially defined and leading State authorities are
quoted as predicting a short crop. The stead
iness of staple prices is a feature- in the pres
ent quietness of trade.
Among the metals copper is firm -on 'the com
bination, while tin is lower after a little spurt;
In the^volume of business doing the Iron trade
compares favorably with recent weeks, and
months and the tone of trade is certainly more
cheerful than nt nnv time ulnM Ihe hi-enlr laar

that the jrttqteuta issafa of new capital last

eqnee ; of .-publ.iti ' interest, ' It 'al'i^/pntjJSitUi fur- .
tr:er eiidence.'of a scarcity fof .floating supplies
of securities . ana of .Â£ decided, indisposition to
decline^ under pressure;; from /bear -->perators.
The volume Of business Is .still : very small and
Â¦was further restricted 1 thlii. week by .the. fait
that the Stock Exchange holiday meiiides 1 to
day as .well as Monday. It is, howWver no
ticed that this fact led to some evening up of
contract!! by the traders and that the sho-t
coverings from such sources probably exceeded
the selling of long stock. At any rate the
market, after showing a rttber weak tone en
last Monday and relapsing into total dullness
on.:Tuesday, was on the whole steady to strong
oti; ; .Wednesday., and Thursday, but showed a :
heavy; tendency with decided dullness on Fri
day. The Chinese complications have appar
ently .passed : into the background, although
bottv London' and our own speculative markets
fere; watching the attitude'.- of the powers to
ward : each other with close attention. The in
fluences in this -connection at the end of the
week were, :. however, considered as more fa
vorable. London, however, is also very dull
an<J its dealings , on the New York, market were
on a trlfilgiff '.abate, its purchases being a. little
larger than its sales. The easing of London 1 '*
money rat eS;/ caused by the receipts within a
fortnight of $20,000,000 in gold by' the Rank df
England; has been checked by the bank, whicji
seems 'to be taking funds from the open mar
ket to prevent, an undue decline and a'with
drqiwal of -- specie to the Continent. ; The harden
ing of discoap.t there Has bÂ»-en held to. indi
cate that further gold shipments may be made
from this side. This did not apparently pro
duce any impression oh the. stock market and
< money continues too easy to cause any serious
, misgivings on this Â«core. : .Domestic politics
have certainly retained/ more earnest : attention
this week on the. part of tho street. There has
; been much discussion as to the chances that
the: progress of the Presidential contest may he
: attended by a brf-ak in prices.' It is also recog
nized that the. holding aloof of the public from
' the market is in part due to a feeling of this
kind, or, as some put it, to a tendency on
the port of capital to wait for such a decline
: in order to acquire stocks on favorable terms.

SUMMARY :0F: r THE MARKETS:
COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
spring. The historj' of the slump and raliy
in the finished material market is. however,
being repeated in the pig iron trade. Pro
ducers are apparently so anxious to have a
supply of orders on hand this fall that they
arc readily, selling, their production ahead at
relatively low quotations, some of these in fact
being at bottom rates. On the' other hand an
offer of an order for 15.000 tons for next -"-ear s
delivery . has been rejected, the claim i being
that present quotations are too low and wi.i
be exceeded in a month or so. Â¦ Export inquiry
for all classes of material is and has been
good. Bars,- shapes and plates note good do
mestic and export inquiry and are firmer at
the East and ?1 to $2 higher at Chicago. South
ern iron stocks of hipher grades are reported
oversold at Birmingham.: . . ' â¢â¢ . ..
To disappointing foreipn Â¦'-. advices and the
backward state of the spring demand for cot
ton goods are to be attributed the. shading m
raw cotton this week/ Thf>. spring season in
men's wear woolens has-bwn rather disap
pointing so -far,-: .while". the ''j'-bbins. demand for
dress goods is quite favorahle. ...Manufacturers

OAKLAND, Aug. 81. â She who steals
a stage purpp certainly steals trash,
but Fhe who tak^s a stage name
takes that which the owner thinks
leaves her poor indeed. So thinks Miss
Pearl Evelynne of Oakland, and her
thoughts are directed against Mi?s Pearl
Evelynne of San Francisco. If any one
were to ask Miss Pearl Evelynne of Oak
land what there was in a name she would
reply that there was a great deal, par
ticularly when the original owner of the
name objects to the wearing of tights and
the second owner of the name thinks that
tights are jupt about right on the stage.
It all came about when Mlsa Pearl Ev
f-lynne of Oakland, who claims that name
as her really and truly own. saw that
Miss Pearl Evelynne of San Francisco
also claimed that name as her real and
truly own and not tho stage variety name.
Thn" names wore unusual, and Miss Ev
elynno of Oakland did not see how ex
actly the same name could have been
bestowed upon some young lady, with the
additional coincidence of both being on
the Ptage.
But when It eam*> about that Miss Pearl
Evelvnne of San Francisco had her pic

attended the fniblle schools here until she
was 10 yenrs old, when she made her
debut at the old People's x heater. At
the time she entered upon her stage
career she was a prominent member of the
Christian Endeavor Society and her al
leged "harksJirling" caused a slight Fen
sation in certain church circles. During
the past two years she has appeared as
Ingenue and leading lady in several suc
cessful Eastern productions. She is now
under the management of XV. A. Brady,
"People who know me may see a picture
of Pearl's namesake dressed in her tights
p.nd think she is my daughter. Now that
would be awful. We will attempt to
make the Tivoli girl assume another
name, as I fr ; ar my daughter's reputation
is at stake."
Mrs. May Evelynne, the mother of the
Oakland Pearl Evelynne, Is now in Oak
land, while her daughter Is In the East.
Mrs. Evelynne Is playlnp at the Mac
donough Theater, and this Is what she
says about the name question:
"No sooner had my daughter made a hit

When I jaw the name Pearl Evelynne

had a perfect right to go by her chris
tened name. Pearl Evelynne. Now that
is my daughter's real name also and .we
don't know what to do about It. My Pearl
never wore tights and does not want to
be confounded with a young woman who
does.
So It comes about that there Is war over
a name, and Miss Pearl Evelynne of Oak
land, who thinks that heavy drapings are
the proper thing for the female form,
and Miss Pearl Evelynne of San Fran

trying to solve the name question to the
satisfaction of their friends and families.

ALMEDA COUNTY, OAKLAND, BERKELEY
YOUNG MERRITT

His Selection Left to Pour
Alameda Superior
Judges.
Horace W. Philbrook's Petition Is
Denied on the Ground of TnÂ«
Antagonism to All
Parties.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Aug. 31.
The Merritt children are to have a guar
dian, but it will not be Horace W. Phil
brook. So decided Judge Sweeney tKls
afternoon.
"I am of the opinion that the Merrltt
children are In need of a guardian," said
the court. "But he must be some one other
than this petitioner. I do not consider
Mr. Philbrook a proper person, as hÂ« Is
antagonistic to all the parties In this mat
ter and certain courts of this State. I
would suggest that nominations for a
guardian be made now."
Attorney Emll Nusbaumer then pro
posed the name's of John R. Glascock and
William R. Davis, but both declined. It
was then agreed after some talk to leave
the selection of a guardian to the four
Judges of the Alameda County Superior
Court. On their recommendation, Judge
Sweeney will make the appointment. The
final decision will be reserved until a
guardian is agreed upon.
The first witnesses in the case this
morning were Do. John A. Miller and Dr.
L?o Rodgers of San Francisco, who were
called by Philbrook in rebuttal to Judge
Paterson's testimony yesterday regarding
the petitioner's sanity. : * Â¦
Referring to Philbrook Attorney Bosley
asked of Dr. Miller:
"If a thoroughly honorable man should
become convinced tHat another man had
conspired to betray a trust, and had writ
ten to that person charging him with
these crimes, and should thereafter visit
on a friendly footing and attempt to hold
social intercourse as if nothing had hap
pened, what would you think of his men
tal condition?"
"I should say he was Insane; that he
had n.o sense of moral responsibility," was
the reply.
After the physicians, Emil Nusbaumer
was again called as a witness. He pro
duced a letter dated April 16, 1897, contain
ing a demand from Philbrook for $5000 out
of the Knowles trust. Philbrook based
his claim on the fact that A. A. Moore
had received that sum. The petitioner
bitterly opposed the introduction of his
letters to Reed & Nusbaumer, but the ob
jection was overruled. The contingency
of children was provided for in Mrs. Gar
celon's will and that they should have
guardians other than parents to care for
the property that will some day be theirs.
"The parents of these children are not
capable guardians;" argued Philbrook.
"Why, they are so anxious to get all they
can that they are actually robbing their
own offspring."
The petitioner occupied some time In
presenting authorities.
Attorney Nusbaumer's reply to Phil
brook was a scathing denunciation of the
petitioner and his methods. He said:
"This man talks of wolves pursuing a
wounded bison, when he himself was only
too anxious to become a member of tfie
so-called band of wolves If he could. Be
cause he could not rob his client, James
Merritt, he brings this action, flouting
the awful monster, 'fraud, conspiracy.'
Tie does not rely upon law, but must
come with infamy and vlciouaness and
with a disordered brain to defame honor
able men. Philbrook is litigation crazy.
He accuses the Merrltt boys of robbing
their own children. . That one statement
shows the depravity of the man."
Justice Frederick W. Henshaw was pres
ent In the courtroom this afternoon, but
was excused from testifying. Owing to
the prominence given by th>> Times and
Enquirer to the fact that Justice Hen
shaw had exacted fees for his appearance
as a witness, he had addressed the follow
ing letter to the Times:
OAKLAND, Cal., Augr. 31, ISM.
Kdltor Times: In your Issue of August 30
you Rive conspicuous prominence to the. fact
that I exacted fees from Mr. Phtlbrook when
lie subpenaed me to attend as a witness in thÂ«
matter of the guardianship of the Merrltt
minors. Perhaps the. reasons and circum
stances actuating me may prove of equal in
terest to your readers.
When subpenaed I was conyrioun of knowing
nothlnsr about any of the questions nr matters
Involved. I thought then and still think that
It was done polely to annoy and disturb the
business of the rourt of which I was a member,
which court war then and Is now in spskIoii
and to which court Mr. Phllbrook's hostility
Is known. Therefore I exacted the witness
fee.. I carried the. money In my hand and
pave It Immediately to the court bailiff, ex
plaining the matter to him and Instructing him
to give the $2 to some deserving- poor person
or to some worthy ehartty. He has since In
formed me that he did so. Truly vours.

ALAMEDA'S NEW
CHARTER DOWNED
BY THE PEOPLE
Defeated at the Polls by a
Decisive Majority of
Eighty-Five.
Twelve Hundred and Eighty-Eight
Votes Cast at tho Election.
Two Factions in tire
Field.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 31.â The election to
day resulted in the defeat of the free
holders' charter by a majority of eighty
five votes. Great interest was taken in
the election, the proponents and op
ponents of the charter working their
hardest to sway the voters. The heavy
voting was done in the morning by the
commuters who came down to the sta
tions where the polling places w$re lo
cated. There was some confusion at
Chestnut and Bay stations on account of
the absence in the morning of the latf
registration sheets, a number of com
muters losing their votes. '; f : '.' V_"~'
At each of the polling places the char
terites were represented by workers.
Among these were Frederick. Cone and
T C. Stoddard at Precinct 1; A. F. St.
Sure William Pettes and Charles Nelson
at Precinct 2; E. J. Holt and Louis
Fischer at Precinct 3; B. C. Brown and
A L. Huff at Precinct 4; F. C. Volberg
and A. II. Marshall at Precinct 5. The
workers against the charter did not con
fine themselves to any particular pre
cinct, but picked up votes wherever they
could Dr. C. L. Tisdale. J. B. Lanktree.
E Minor Smith, Thomas White, City
Clerk Lamborn, City Trustee Alexander
Mackie. Frank Browning and W. F.
Bailey were among , those of the oppo
sition force?. , v.it :
The Municipal League was for the
charter and the opponents of that politi
cal division in Alameda opposed the
charter. The fight was largely upon
these lines. :Â¦Â¦-Â¦ ;^ *-/
The total vote polled was 12SS. The vote
in the five precincts for and against the
charter was as follows:
First precinctâ 126 for. 162 against; Sec
ond precinctâ 150 for, 10S against; Third
precinctâ 130 for, lt*7 against; Fourth
precinctâ H3 for, 160 against; Fifth pre
cinctâ10 for, 81 against. Totals: 593 for,
678 against; 17 illegal. In only one pre
cinct, the Second, was the majority in
favor of the charter.

BULLDOG BITES
AN EX-POUNDMAN
- >^N AKLAND, Aug. 31.â With
' ff \\ the passing away of hla offt
- II JJ cial rule over the canine
<Â¦ \ is^/ kingdom of Oakland ex-
Poundmaster George Taylor
? lost the magic spell which used to
Â»* make local dogdom floe at the wav
- ing of his netted wand. To-day he
Â¦ was treated at the Receiving Hospi
? tal for lacerations, the results of
- an cttack upon him by a bulldog.
This morning as Taylor emerged
- from his front door he found an un
- licensed animal making himself at
>- home on the lower step. The for
- mer poundmaster remembered the
- days when dogs,' warned by the
? cries of the children of the neigh
? horhood, sought the protection of
- back alleys and friendly yards. He
- planted his boot (irmly athwart the
- canine's ribs. But the dog missed
? the rumble of the poundmah's
- wagon and the swish of his encir
- cling net. The king was shorn of
- his majesty, and the bull pup pro
- ceeded to shear his hide. And that
?j was why Taylor visited the Re
- ceiving Hospital.THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1900.

Â«jj=^.UBLIC Administrator Patrick Bo
j L_^/ land has some decided views : and
j lÂ£ docs not hesitate to express them
on occasion. Such an occasion
arose at the meeting of the Iriquois Club
last evening when Mr. Boland precipitated
a lively discussion by objecting vlgorously
to the singing "of "America" at the close
j of its installation exercises.
It all came about most unexpectedly.
j The committee appointed to draw up a
i suitable ritual presented its report, and ,
1 its acceptance was moved.
"There i? one feature, of that pro-
I gramme which I cannot consistently . ln
; dorse,". â¢: .^ald Mr. Roland. "The
committee recommends !%iat ' the cere
monies conclude with the singing
j of 'America.' Now I object. That-song is
( nothing' more nor less than" a rehash of
â¢God Save the Queen.' The sentiments

SUNDAY'S BIG
EXCURSION
nothing that this club represents. Heard
at a distance I'll take my oath that the
tune -was the national air of England.
"The tune of 'America' was originally
a. French hymn sung for his Highness,
Louis XIII, then it was exported to Ger
many, then to England- and -finally It
reached America. I move you; Mr. Chair
man, that in place of 'America' we sing
the 'Star Spangled Banner.' "
By this tune a dozen or more members
were moving uneasily in their chairs, and
there waa a general scramble for the floor
as Boland sat down. .
J. G. Dexter was recognized by the
chair. . â¢ . .
"From as early as I, can remember, and
that is quite a long time, "said he, "I
have bflcn in the habit of singing 'Amer
ica.' I was taught to love It as I love
my country. The author was an Ameri
can through and -through. His name was
Smith. - The- sentiments of the song are
American from top to bottom. If there
is any Amfrican hymn at all to-day It is
certainly 'America.' "
T. C. Spelling created a laugh by sug
gesting that it would be a good Idea to
have "America" read for the benefit of
those who might not know the words.
Boland said It was not the sentiments
he objected to, but the tune.
Major Lewis said the "Star-Spangled
Banner" reminded him of the "fact that
the farmers have voted, for protection.
"We have been led like a pig with a ring
in his nose behind the 'Star-Spangled
Banner.'" he said. "The 'cause of
democracy, pure and simple, needs an In
vocation like 'America.' We can all sing
'America,' but I don't -helieve there are
three of us here to-night who can sing
the 'Star-Spangled Banner.' If it origi
nated with the -English,' so much the bet
ter; so did the 'Star-Spangled Banner'
and 'Yankee Doodle.' "
Mr. Boland took exceptions to the
"Yankee Doodle" statement. He claimed
it to be an out and. out Yankee produc
tion.
Judge A. J. Lemon said he preferred the
"Star-Spangled Banner." The discussion
was then brought to a close by a motion
referring the question back to the 1 com
mittee for further consideration. The
committee will report at the next meet
ing.
R.- P. Troy delivered n speech on im
perialism, and Mark R. Plalsted, proprie
tor of the Fresno Democrat, spoke on the
Democratic situation in general.

the City Hall. : For two days the Exam
iner has been publishing statements de
rived from the Mayor's stock of vast and
ready misinformation. Swimming in this
frothy sea and neatly islanded from sur
rounding leagues of "yellows" by the use
of borders there appeared yesterday a
resolution fathered by Sam Braunhart
calling upon the Board of Public Works
to ascertain and report the cost of re
moving the present roof from the Â¦ City
Hall and replacing it with a . mansard
roof and story. .
The outgivings in the Examiner and the
proposition contained in the resolution
that Sam Braunhart has evolved are so
easily traced through intrinsic evidence
to Mayor Phelan that he will not deny
their paternity. To furnish a reason for
the change in the roof an attack was
made upon the existing roof, which was
described In large type as "fourteen acre3
of cracked concrete and that Is what the
city has for money squandered on tho
hail roof." Mayor Phelan was also rep
resented as having fought the present
roof "with tooth and claw." The clear
intention to prepare for a huge and un
necessary raid has stirred up the indig
nation of solid citizens. The scheme, so
pay prominent citizens, will be fought
bitterly: if the new "roof ring" tries to
force it. 'Â¦ . ' '. :'. ,
The proposed mansard roof would cost,
according to Architect Frank T. Shea,
$1,500,000. instead of $200,000, as estimated
in the Examiner's misleading story. The
cement roof now in place can be made
satisfactory for fifty years by the expendi
ture of $jyu0 for "topping," needed to put
upon the cement base. "Strange it is."
said Mr. Shea, "if the present roof Ib
leaky and only cracked cement, that dur
ing the four years it has been in place
it has cost nothing worth mentioning for
repairs." When he was asked about the
story that the roof has cracked the ex
terior walls of the City Hall by its weight,
Mr. Shea answered that the statement
could not be true; that a mansard roof
would put a much greater strain upon the
walls. Â¦ *
Mr. Shea was the architect of the City
Hall Commissioners when the cement roof
was put on. "I challenge any one to
show." he said, "that it does not corre
spond, structurally, with the roofs of all
large, modern, fireproof buildings. The
only question is concerning the topping.
The use of felt for topping had not been
sufficiently exploited to demonstrate its
success when the work was done. As I
have said, $5000 will supply the necessary
topping."
The absurdity of the claim of the Ex
aminer that "fourteen acres" of man
sard roof could be put on for $200,000 was
apparent. As a matter of fact there are
only about two and a half acres in the
City Hall roof. Mr. Shoa said it was not
surprising if the cement roof leaked some.
All large roofs leak. The cement is the
easiest substance to repair and the easiest
to discover a Haw in so Mr. Shea insists.

enjoying the pay and emoluments of a
major in the Filipino army.. ,
In March of this year Vance was'cap
tured in the company of two Filipinos.
He tried to explain that he was a pris
oner, but the men with him Informed the
Americans that he was a major in their
army. The traitor was wearinc side
arms at the time, which gave the He to
his story of being a captive.
He was tried by court-martial and sen
tenced to be shot. The findings of the
court were approved by President Mc-
Klnley with the exception of the sentence,
which was commuted to confinement for
ninety-nine years. He was confined In the
prison at Bilibld until the Thomas waa
ready to sail, when, In company with
thirty-eipht others, he was confined
aboard that vessel. The other prisoners,
some of whom have '.ong terms to serve,
treated Vance with the utmost contempt,
refusing even to talk with him. He went
over the side of the old Thomas to the
cell at Alcatraz which he will occupy for
the balance of his days and not a word
of sympathy did he receive.

FOR the next ninety-nine years, if
he should happen to live that long,
all that Henry Vance, late private
of the Thirty-seventh United States
Infantry, will see of the world will be
through the bars of his cell at Alcatraz.
Despised and hated by his fellow-prlson
c-rs he will not even have the consolation
of hearing a friendly voice.
Vance Is a Mexican by birth and had
fousnt with Spaniards in the Spanish-
American war. He hung around Manila
and when the Thlrtv- seventh Infantry
was organized enlisted. He became chief
musician and used every opportunity to
Inform himself of the movements of our
troops. It was proven later that he had
used" the knowledge for the benefit of the
Filipinos.
â¢ The latter part of December of ISM he
disappeared and for flve months nothing
was heard of him by the military author
ities beyond vague rumors that ho was
