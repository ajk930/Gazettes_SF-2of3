SOME ODD WAYS OF
WOOING SLEEP.
3I.KEI*. O gentle neep, how havo I

thousands of wesry mortals both before

was a martyr to insomnia for a long time
until, in a happy moment of inspiration.
cne of tha court physicians hit upon the
rxtraordinary notion of patting the auto

weighed down his eyelids. So ndmlrable
was this specific found to be that it waÂ«
immediately adopted by the Shah, and It
Is stated that the suit* which accompa

occupation took the form of helping to
send their master into the realms of the
drowsy Morpheus. .
At the Paris Exhibition thore is shown
the model of a cave once occupied by a
famous Greek brigand, who was in the
haLit cf being sent to sleep by the drop
ping of pieces of gold from the roof of
the cave on a carpet beneath. The gold
thus dropped : represented some of the
booty that he had acquired from passing
travelers, and sÂ»o dear had the Rqund of
coin become to him that nothing but its
chink upon the grcund would soothe his
eyelids to sleep. Of all queer methods of
Inducing drowsiness, the foregoing would
certainly seem to be the queerest.
A gentleman who resided for many yeara
in the town of Worcester was unable to
drop off to sleep unles half 'a dozen
peaches were placed under his pillow, as
he averred that the perfume of the fruit
brought with, it a certain degree of drowsi
ness.
Too much cannot be said In favor of
the custom of running barefoot and this

"The woman who would have a small,
neat foot, or who wishes her children to
have such a foot, will always choose a
shoe whose sole Is very thick, but at tha
same time soft. This acts as a foil
against the hardness of the surface un

"Much of the evil effect of city pave

tralized by care and attention. Tha
woman who has justtmoved to town wants
to tear in mind that she must In time
wear a larger shoe, and that it Is well
to attain to Xo. 4 or 5 gradually and not
cling to the old number until her feet ara

"In the feet of a woman who has al

While the slot machine is simple vmd
automatic in its rtperation, the Chinese
lottery is a puzzle and a study about
which those thoughtful people have writ
ten volumes.
The ticket itself Is simple enoughâmere
ly eighty characters printed -on one sldo
of a square i>lece of paper. - The words
which the characters . represent" are lm
. material to the play and consist sorr.e
. times of poetry and occasionally of lucky
astrological symbols, but always arranged
in lines and. columns. They" are. printed
fronv wooden' blocks on thin bamboo pa
per, and as but one in a million of them
ever draws over" sixteen dollars in ordi
nary play, -there is little chance of their
being counterfeited.
Each ticket bears at its head the name
of the company which issues it. The main
portion Is divided into eighty square
spaces, of which forty are above and for-
ty are below a central dividing band of
Chinese characters. In each of the spaces
is a smaller word sign.
To' explain the manner in .which the lot
tery is operated, the Chinese characters
on the ticket may be disregarded and the
squares designated by letters for the hori
zontal lines and .figures for the vertical
Â¦ columns. ] â¢ â¢ . . ,
When a drawing Is. to. be decided each'
one of the eighty characters is cut out
or otherwise obtained and. folded and roll
ed Into a little pellet.* These eighty, pel
lets are thrown into an urn from whlea
they are taken out one at a time and
dropped successively In rotatlon'into four
small jars, numbered from one to four, un
til the eighty have been distributed, twen
ty in each Jar.
Another operator prepares four pellets,
each carrying a number of one of the
jars. These four pellets are then cast Into
a basin of such shape that they. are con
cealed from view.
A third man then draws one pellet and
the Jar which bears its number , contains
the twenty winning spots. The remaining
Jars are then removed, the pellets in' the
chosen-jar unrolled, the characters read
one by one and marked on the ticket as
shown in figure 2, giving clO, dlO, a9, a8.
c8, c7, b5, d4. a3. d3. d2, e9, e7, g7, e6, : g4,
h4, f3. g3 and h3 as the winning spots.
The standard method of Â¦ playing Is the
straight ten : spot ticket (snap tim chi).
The purchaser desiring to play this se
lects any ten spots which he chooses and
marks them on the ticket in the presence
of the agent. The price may be from one
cent to one' dollar, the prizes not being
fixed sums, but fixed multiples of the
amount of the purchase price.
Figure 3 illustrates the manner In which
a straight ten-spot ticket Is marked. The
spaces Indicated as having been selected
by the player are a5, a4,d4. a3, d3, d2, dl.
The first hundred dollars' worth of tick
ets would produce twenty dollars* worth
of prizes. ThiÂ« last lonely golden eagle, if
reinvested in tickets, would fly away for
ever and the silver lining to the cloud
of sorrow caused thereby would be four*
silver dollars, which would drop to eighty
cents, and total despair would come at
tho ten-cent mark, which would buy one
last ticket. Total time required to harvest
this crop of wisdom, four days. -
AH of these losses are computed without
including the agent's 11 per cent commis

taking any chance, but hard cash every
But the Chinese hand-labor lotteries are
being rapidly- driven out of business by
the machine-made gambols of the auto
matic nickel-in-the-slot machines, which,
unlike the old lotteries, make a draw

ewallow nickels like . a lixard licking up

Cr to try yet another method of win
ning a fortune without work: If you start
ed with a hundred dollars and put it all
into tickets, this is the rapid manner In
which the nve shining twenties would
travel toward the small end of the horn;
To put in in another way: If you bought
all of the tickets issued by any one lot
tery and won all prizes they would
pmount to but one-fifth of the cost of the
tickets.
Thus do chance? become certainties, and
the. pork-fed manipulator of the "day
time" and "night time" lotteries lets the
lottery player take the chances while he
takes the cash by arranging the prizes and
blanks in such manner as to never pay
back as premiums more than one-fifth of
the total receipts. '
China lotteries are. as figured according
to the doctrine of chances, a law which
is In the long run as certain as that of
gravity. It goes on this planâ that if you
flip a dollar a million times, or rather, eay
flip a dimeâ It would be less workâ by the
doctrine cf chances, everything else being
equal. It will conie half a milion times
heads and half a million times tails: or.
rather, it would be within a few hundred
times of that number, but close enough to
re' ure the variation to a very small per

"When a man wants to play machine

then it3 wheels begin to turn around and
think whether they will give the man a

"The machine has a very smart mind.
and most of the times It thinks it will

"That gives the own^r much profit and
the machine much gladness, so that some

According to the histories, our pirate
citizens came to Sulu Island from Bor

possession of Luzon. They were Malays
by birth and Mohammedans in religion.
They very quickly dominated the' Sulu
group and Mindanao, for they, were 'as
aggressive and capable as tho old Vikings.
When the Spaniard undertook the task
of subduing the Sulu Islands by the meth
ods that had been successful in the West
The Malays had undertaken the work
of capturing the ship at the change of
the watch. As the two mates chatted for
a moment the two went to them, com
plaining of illness. â¢ But as soon as they
were within reach they stabbed both
mates to death. Then they made a clash
at the eailors, only one of whom made a
fight. Two sailors were killed as they ran
and two wounded, the man who fought
seriously though not fatally. One of the
sailors ran aloft and one hid in a store
room in a deckhouso, where the carpenter
slept. The Malays took these men,' one
at a time, and killed them in cold blood,

Then the captain went out on deck.. He
found most cf the crew had barricaded
themselves in the forecastle. Bringing
them out. he armed thvm and started a

these craft in 1S42, that ranged from twen
ty to thirty tons in burden, each of which
was manned with from forty to fifty men.
The number decreased from year to year
thereafter. They used both sails and pad
dles; the- latter having ' diamond-shaped
blades. A cross section of one of these
huge dug-outs was very nearly an equi
lateral triangle, the two sides representing
the bottom' being slightly rounded. The
breadth across the outriggers was' about
eleht rimes the beam of the-canoe. The
speed of the boat, whether under sail or
paddle, was tremendous when the water
was smooth enough. .>
For weapon's afloat they had swords,
knives,* : spears and hatchets, but the
sword arid knife were used most, the fa

The Malays, whether resident there or
coming from the islands to the west, aro
not the only pirates that have infested the
Philippine, group. The Chinese, until very
recently, were capable and daring sea rov
ers, who did not hesitate to sweep through
the Philippine group in search of prey.
As long ago as 1S0G an Englishman who
was taken by them and lived. to tell his
experiences found that the pirates had no
less than 600 different ships with guns
ranging up to eighteen-poundersâ some of
them had batteries as good as those of an
English frigate. The fleet was then com
manded by Woo Che-tslng. Afterward a
woman was the pirato commodore. These
freebooters swept the whole region, but
one does riot need to go back so far as
that- to read of the depredations of the
Chinese pirates who .uaed 'the Philippine
group as well as their own coast. In the
the pirates were as* numerous In those
open* seas as bumboatmen In the ports, as
the owners of the Boston ship Celestial
learned. ?.'.}'*
But the Chinamen, even when not nu
merous, were never dreaded as were our
Maiavs of Sulu. Â¦ For the Chinaman with
trhaer control, nuvmg these, and such
small steamers as those captured by
Deweyat Cavlte in hand, the Spaniards
forbade the Sulus to go afloat without
first obtaining a special permit from a
Spanish Governor, and to get that it was
necessary for the Sulus to go off with the
Spanish flag flying, -without arms and in
boats that were riot manned for a fight.
Every Sulu boat found at sea was shot
to pieces unless it had a -written permit
and complied with these regulations. By
no less stringent measures than these
could the pirates be held in check.
As the captain's fool reached the floor
he slipped in a pool of his own blood,

When the water in the boiler has come ta
a boil the small fruit is generally ' cooked
Refer to your "table" and see how much
sugar Is required for, say, six quarts of
the canned berries. Put In a granite pan
and meltâ as with the larger fruitâ using
Just enough boiling water to dissolve tha
sugar. When It has become a syrup di
vide It equally among the six jars.- Fill
each to within an inch of the rim with
lukewarm water. Place the jars then into
a boiler of water In the same manner
as the other Jars were treated, only re
membering that berries do not require so
much cooking.
The less handling the better for all small
fruit, so It Is well to put berries directly
into the Jars as the fruit la picked over,
thus avoiding any unnecessary crushing.
Of course, use only the tested Jars. When
the fruit is cooked and ready to sea! is
a bad time to discover that the jar la not
airtight.
Small fruit should be looked over care
fully and every overripe or crushed berry
thrown aside. In buying the fruit for can
ning avoid those boxes In which the ber
ries are compactly settled. They hAve
been too long picked and generally, as a
consequence, are too ripe for canning.
Just as you arrange the fruit in the Jara
for boiling, so it will appear when served
on the table later. An ambitious house
keeper can display great skill In the fill
ing of the Jars if she cares to take tha
pains that placing the fruit demands.
With peaches, for example, the pits can
be so arranged that in showing through
the jars they form a pleasing decoration.
In peeling pineapples be particular to
take out .ill the "eyes,' *or the fruit will
look specked. T>o not slice a pineapple
for canning, but with a silver fork tear
the fruit from the core in small pieces.
Quinces are so large that they can bet
ter if quartered. The peeling and cores
should be saved and utilized in making
jelly.
The Bartlett pear is perhaps the most
satisfactory kind for canning. Many leave
the seeds In, in order to get their spe
cial flavor; the same with the pits of the
peaches.
Except In the case of strawberries, se
lect the largest fruit; It should also be
firm and sound. Pare peachts, cut them
In half and pit them, then throw them
into a pan of cold water to await being
put Into the Jarsâ the water will keep them
from discoloring meanwhile. All larsa
fruit should be treated in this way.
For every quart of quinces, twelve
ounces of sugar; whole sour pears, ten;
peaches, six; Dartlett pears, eight: pine
apples, eight; plums, ten; Siberian crab
apples, ten; cherries, eight; whortleber
ries, six; raspberries, six; strawberries,
ten, and ripe currants, ten ounces.
A successful rule to follow for tho
o mount of sugar to be used to each quart
jar of fruit Is as follows:
It is a good plan to test the fruit at the
' end of the ten minutes by taking off Hie
. cover and piercing the top layer with a
.fork. If It Is still hard it requires more
boiling. When done lift each Jar out and
fill it to overflowing with boiling water;
- then give the final fastening and place :hs
\ jar .inverted on the table. If it -does not
. leak it ~ Is ready to set away far winter
.use. ': - . - ', , .Â¦ _.. t
When the fruit has Become quite cool
the tops of every jar should again ba
tightened. A dry. cool place, away from
the light, should be selected as their win
ter quarters, and care must be taken that
they are not handled until taken down for
table use. Fermentation often follows a
shaking of a jar of fruit.
Now. take a cemmon wash boiler and
put in the bottom of It a board wide
enough to support the jars of fruit. Set
the jara on in a row. or rows* if the board
Is wide enough, and fill the boiler with
water as warm as you can hold your han<2
In. Let the water come to within an inch
of the top of the jars.
Put the boiler over the fire tad let the
fruit boil about ten minutes â or until
done. Do not allow the water to boil too
fast; the gradual heating of the jars pre
vents their breaking.
E'XCLUDING all air from fruit Is the
. secret of success in canning. Uuy
glass Jars with tops that clasp or
screw tightly down. Every one of
the jars should be thoroughly tested be
fore attempting to use them.
Clean well, fill with water, screw on the
tops. Turn them upside down, and leave
for five minutes,' in order to prove that
they are' air tight and will not leak. Some
times when the water oozes out It la be
cause the rubber ring iÂ» defective â a new
one'wtll often- make matters all right.
Fruit In jars is much more attractive if
canned whole, but canning the fruit so l\
one of-the difficult features of the work.
Fill the tested jars with the fruit. If you
use large fruit like quinces or pears, pack
them tightlyâ small fruit should not b*
crowded. ,'
Melt in a granite saucepan the required
.amount of sugar with Just enough boiling
water to dissolve it. After cooling a lit
tle, divide it up equally among the Jars,
pouring it on the fruit, a spoonful at a
time. This will not fill the jars, so pour In
enough lukewarm, water to bring the con
tents a!mcst up to the rim. Put on the
top. but do not screw Jown. for in boil
ing the fruU. the steam must be permitte-i
to escape or the jars will burst.

No fiercer pirates than these ever went
afloat, because bloodshed was a part of
their religion. â¢ No man could be a chief
among them till he had lopped off the
heads of sixty unbelievers. The Spanish
men who wero captured were always
killed, the women were j sent to the ha
rems, and the young children were en
slaved. Not until breech-loading and rap
id-firing weapons came Into use did the
Spanish get even a foothold In the Sulu
irchipelago. General Arolas, a Republican,
was sent there some time In trie eighties
by the Monarchists, who expected him to
die, but he lived and established tho.Span-
til. in spite of crude processes and cruder
tools, they produced ...most - excellent
blades. The Sulu pirate readily cuts clear

blow, and he more easily, splits head and
neck to the shoulders. - v ' s \
The difficulty of taming these' wild men
will be understood when -their religion Is*
considered. Their hatred of Christians Is
cultivated from their, earliest youth, and
the surest road to their heaven Is, In their
belief, to die while killing the hated unbe

known to cut off a slave's head merely to
try the quality of a'.new sword. Our wild

a frog meets with remarkable changes

to be a polliwog. or tadpole, before he

he has gills and only breathes water, then
he loses his gills and breathes air, pop

Besides frog raising Miss Stege carries

and some of the original stock imported
still remain in the ponds.
The mistrcrs cf the frog farm is more

the filling of it. Clad in short skirts and

down over him and when he Jumps ho will

At another pond we found the boat used
for catching the frogs. Nailed fast to. the
bow of it there was a lantern with a
large reflector. Our hoste'ss pointed it out
with her dip net.
"You see." said she, "that is the way
we catch them at night. I think it is real

"It' looks simple,"' she laughed, "but you
should see beginners trying to ' catch
frogs. There was a portly gentleman, a
caterer from the city, over here some time
ago. He suggested that we have a frog
leg dinner, and I told him all right, if he
would catch the frogs. It was about 1
o'clock In the afternoon. He started off
with the dip net and a pair 'of rubber
boots. , We sat here in : the garden and
watched him. In the boiling sun the poor
fellow steered the boat about and threw

tadpole, and when he Is not yet a frog, he
is a comical fellow. He has some tail, a
great deal of hind legs, and two lunny
little sprouting front legs. A bullfrog
tadpole is a peculiar creature indeed at
this stase. of his life." . â¢
There were perpendicular walls sur
rounding each of the ponds, for the pur
pose ef fencing in the . nomadic croakÂ»rs.
Half way 'up the walls frogs were
struggling to get over, and where an oar
from the boat 1 had been left leaning
against the fence a monstrous frog sat
blinking his eyes In the sun.' Slipping up
from behind Miss Stege grabbed him and
. held him securely.
"Another leap and he would, have been
at large," said she. "You should have
seen them before we put jp '. the walls.
They were all over. One morning we were'
called about daylight by the gardener.
'Oh," Miss Stege, come here, the -frogs are
all out of the ponds and are taking 'the
place by storm. Please get up quick!* I
dressed hurriedly, and ran out to find the
grounds . alive with , frogs, a hopping,
nit or similarity, nut ras ready to ac
cept her word for it. It was my impres
sion that what she didn't know about
frogs would not fill a very large volume.
"Don't they keep you awake at night?"
I asked, thinking^ of some country
choruses I had heard. She laughed.
"People ask such funny questions.'* she
said. "Why no! The rort of frog on-?
eats has not much to say at night, and
we never notice them when they do.
These big ' fellows roar in different keyÂ«i
and the little ones squeak away, but I
never was disturbed by them yet. Some
one who was over here recently went
away and said that frogs followed me
about over the grounds and hopped after
me wherever I went. That Is absurd.
Why, when I go where people know who
I am they have all taken to looking m
me queerly, as if they thought I had a

We had heard and we went to sec. Down
the long lane that leads to the station
there came a procession of dogs-a mon
strous St. Bernard, a frisking little Scotch

wobbling fox terrier-all with wagging
tails and a welcome. At the gate we met
their mistress. After much coaxing the

"AH right, I will let you do that Come

The ponds were under the weeping wll-

covered, with here and there a black
point lifted out of the green surface. The
black points were the noses of frogs, and
frogs sat on the bank, frogs leaped off
the walla, frogs splashed Into the waU*
. Walking out en a plank that reached
across part of the pond, she tucked up her
skirts, poised the dip net and waited un
til the frog arose to the surface. Then
there was a dexterous fling of the net,
and a leap into the air, but the leap land
ed him in the net. whence he was extract
ed and thrown back Into his own prem
ises.
"You see it Is Quite an art, catching
"Dear me! How did that fellow get In
here?" exclaimed Miss Stege, as she went
after h:m with her net. "You see. they
will climb over the walls, and ono frog
like that in the tadpole pond can play
havoc with the baby wlggletalls. Watch
a moment, and maybe I can catch him.
There he Is. over there."
With her long dip net the mistress ot the
frog farm reached out and raked away
the green lichens from the surface of tho
pond. There was a scurry and a. thou
sand little tails wiggled away in every
direction. There, was ,i splash near by, as
an immense frog jumped in after them.
"Here is where v.-c keep the little fel

Roosevelt's Fiyle is admirable. He has
fo much of real worth to say . that he
wastes no tim* In word-painting, but
presents his point? In language that is
plain, simple and direct. One point he ln
si^tt* t:pon In the first few pages for a
proper understanding of what is to follow,
an<] that Is the modern character of the
nwTCBKDt which resulted In the estab
lishment of the Commonwealth. In part
he says:
"In Kntrland there was practically peÂ«ce
during the first forty years of. the cen
tury, but it was an Ignoble and therefore
an evil peace. Of course, peace should be
Â¦the- aim of all statesmen and Is the aim of
the jrrratos t statesmen. Nevertheless, not
only the greatest statesmen, but all men
who ar/* truly wise and patriotic, recog
nize that peace Is only good when it
mm*"? honorably and Is used for honor
able purposes, and that the peace of merÂ©
sloth or incapacity is as great a curse as
the most unrighteous war. Those who
Â«ioubt this would do well to study the con
dition of England during the relgm of
James I arid during the firfft part of the
reign of Charles I. England had then no
ftuv.<iins array and no foreign policy
worthy of the name. .The chief of her
colonies was frrov.ing up almost against
her wishes and wholly without any help
or care from her. I/i short, she realized
the condition* as regards her relations
*-ith the outride world and 'militarism'
which certain philosophers advocate at
the present dav for America. The result
Â«us a Erradunl rotting: of the national
fiber, which rendered it necessary for her
to paÂ«? through the firry ordeal of the
Civil War ,in order that she might be
saved."
Incidentally. In speaking of the peace in
England during the first forty years of
the of-ntury. the Governor throws out a
few hints by way of justification of recent
Tv.'irliko advances in our own country, as
follows: . â¢_ ,

fifty papes and yet gives the reader an

vi. Pcrwmal Rule
The Cromweilian period is one cf the
most interesting in the history of the
vorld and the character cf this man. whom
Governor Roosevelt terms "the greatest
man" who has ruled England since the
days cf the Conquest." has awakened* as
much controversy as probably that of an\
other man who ever lived. The author of

confessed admirer of the famous "Old

criticise severely his iniquities according

Where thr flaring hat turns back fionr
the face the blue velvet is covered with
minkâ not the bright, yellowish mink, but
a soft brown shade that should match the
hair it lies igainst. There is something
very cozy and warm about the way this
fur nestles close to the forehead, and the
white roses that arise from it are as much â¢
a surprise as green carnations from the
earth. They are garden roses, round and
fT takes a Californian or a Frenchman
| to make rosvs bloom in midwinter.
L. The difference is that' the Californian
produces then in his garden and the
Frenchman on his hats.
They are to bloom this winter as never
before, these French roses. They have
already come to tov.n like a gala day pa
raOe just to show us that we might as
well bo jolly anyhow. Right in the mids*
of furs they blossom forth In the abnor
mal combination that only a Frenchman
knows how to make. Heavy folds and
choux of velvet may be cuddling: warmly
Into a mass of mink, when lo and behold,
out from the midst of the wintry heap
springs a whole bushful of maiden-blush
or Duchess rosos. The Frenchman who
makes hats has always been a wizard,
and he is showing- more of his tricks this
year than ever before.
The hat of the season is made for the
hair of the season. The big. Huffy pom
padour that has replaced the rigid one
demands a hat thrown back from the face
to give it freedom to fluff. The hatr obey.
Up In the front and down in the back
they are tilted, not so very differently
from the poke bonnets of our grandmoth
ers' day. .You will look like a full blown
poster In any one of them. And yet they
have as many individualities as the wo
men who are to wear them, for the wise
may read written in the subtlety of their
tints and tilts; brunette or Monde, aqui
line or retrousse, as the case may be.
There iÂ« a stone-blue hat. for instance,
that is poir.s begging for eyes that match.
Panne velvet it Is made of, for velvet Is
the basis of hats this season. Now and
then a felt creeps in, but It feels a bit
111 at ease.
- The stone-blue velvet bears the magic
name of Virot stamped in gtjld letters and
stitched to the while silk of its lining.
It Is worth while to notice that this mas
ter of milliners is simplicity personified
In his designing. Good material and chic
mark a Virot hat. but elaborate' nothings
arc never heaped upon Its Innocent crown.
A -word to the wise, you know. Is suffi
cient.
middle. There isn't a hat among them mo
coquettish as this. Come up behind thÂ»
wearer and _you will Judge her the de
murest of- the demure in solemn black:
get a'recp into her face and you will sea
a garden- full of the giddiest pink roses
that ever blossomed Inside a Quakeresqua
poke. ;?}'Jr
. The Anclenne liaison of Paul Virot and
Qerthe sends out a pattern in golden
brown velvet faced with puffy, embossed
chiffon. The chiffon Is white, embroidered
In gold thread that catches spangles here
and there In Its weaving. The oddity of
the season appears on tni3 hat; It Is thÂ©
whole skin of a little brown mink, which
is folded over the brim.' Us tail dangling
against the wearer's hair. Perhaps we
shall sec leopard skins and bear rugs
draped over the hats of the future.
Â¦Double brims appear occasionally by
way of novelty. A light gray felt haa an
Inner brim of pastel blue satin, and the
same blue combined with rose forma
choux on high. A "fancy" of pale blua
and guinea feathers folds over the brtma
at the front. The colors are all pale and
cold, as in some snow landscape. Perhaps
Virot was thinking of one when he de
signed it; at any rate It Is rather nice to
Imagine that he was.
The most stunning pattern comes from
the Mareacot Soeurs. It is all blazing
red from beginning to end. Plaited strips
of red velvet form the frame, and the
only trimming Is a mass of red roses and
shaded red foliage that nods saucily over
one eye. Â¦
And so It goesâ all sorts and conditions
of hats for all sorts and conditions of
faces. Alas, only one sort and condition
of purse will respond to them; but. then,
there are cosies. They are the next best
thing, â¢ ~ ' ;-
flat and fairly redolent with June, and
they rise to a big cluster that nods over
the face.Â» v . r ;iJ, /
Another blue hat Is . a Felix catln
In the palest shade of turquoise is corded
and drawn over wires to form the frame.
The shape of this hat is a little .UifTer
than the others, its brim a little narrower,
wherein it loses some of Its daring
Frenehiness and may . appeal more
stronsly therefore to the American
woman.
A golden blond Is the girl for this tur
quoise hat--or a clear-skinned brunettÂ©
may wear It to good advantage. If you*
color lies in between, you would better
not risk its dangers^
On H appear roses againâ Impossible
roses this time, of coal bl.ick satin, as
perfect in form as they are absurd in
color. They trail around the whole brim
in company with their glistening green
leavesâ leaves, by the way,, that harmon
ize with the blue as no others would. We
have a right to put green and blue to
getherâthe hills and sky authorize that
â but v. r e have no right to do it unless
we are sure of their being the particular
blue and green 'that guarantee friendly
relations. Â¦ _,
This hat, again, is noticeably simple. Be
sides the roses Its only decoration is a fat
satin chou of the same material as the
hat. This is placed on the brim, a little to
one side of the front, and gives the touch
of impudence that completes the dashing
poke of 1900.
Wings are another fad of the yearâ not
the big turkey buzzard style that has
flapped abroad In the land for several
years, but dainty, little wines, hardly.
larger, than -those of a humming blrdL A

In 1S46 Adams and . Lcvcrrler pointed
out that the motion of the planet Uranus
was disturbed In a progressive manner
probably by an unknown â¢ planet. Tha
ptanet Neptune was discovered in that
year, in consequence of their calculations,
a? everybody knows.
The methods that they employed hava
been perfected since that time and the*
theory of Neptune has heen critically ex
amined by Professor Ncwcomb and others
to see If it yielded any evidence fr>r the
existence of unknown major planets re
volving about the sun in orbits exterior
to those of Uranus and Neptune. Profes
sor Newcomb's conclusions were that the
evidence was not yet decisive either way.
The problem has lately been attacked
again by Hans Lau of Copenhagen, who
flÂ»ds evidence that two such planets exist.
At least If the major planet pointed out
by him do exist the observations of Ura
nus and Neptune which he has used (1530
1SD3) would represent the theoretical mo
tions of these planets better than they ara
represented supposing his planets not to
exist. His two theoretical planets hava
these elements:
First planet â Distance from the sun.
forty-seven times the earth's distance;
mass, one twelve thousand nine hun
dredths of the sun's mass.
Second planetâ Distance from the sun.
seventy-one times the earth's distance;
mass, one twenty-eight hundredth of
dredth of the sun's mass.
Both of these planets are thus exterior
to Neptune, whose distance from the sun
is thirty times the earth's distance. The
first planet has a mass somewhat greater
than that of Neptune, the second tna*s
somewhat greater, than that of Saturn.
Their stellar magnitude would be about
tenth and hence they are easily photo
graphed. Professor Pickering, director o*
the Harvard College observatory, has in
stituted a search for them on the photo
graphic maps of the sky which are In
process of construction at Cambridge.
Such planets as these would have a small,
though appreciable, disk, and would
therefore differ In appearance from tbo
fixed stars in their neighborhood. It Is
likely that if they veritably exist they
could be detected by their appearance
alone In the great telescopes of the Terkes
and Lick observatories.
The researches undertaken by Mr. Lau
are very delicate and it is far from cer
tain that the data are sufficient for the
purpose. The method Is adequate and
sooner or later will lead to a complete
solution.

The history of mysterious plays Is old.
The Oberammorsau Passion Play Is the
outgrowth of the plague that occurred in
1633. The survivors came together and
pledged themselves that every ten years
they would clve the performance as a
means of relitio'^s instruction. In 1779 a
manifesto was issued by the Prince Arch
bishop of Salzburg which condemnfd and
prohibited the Passion Play on account of
the ludicrous mixture of the sacred and
profane, and the same was enforced by
the civil authorities of Austria and Ba
varia. However, through special appeal
made by the priests and villagers the
Prince permitted the play to be contin
ued, with the understanding that it was
to be revised so as to omit such parts as
would offend the more pious. The play
Is given in German. Oberammergau haa
MOO inhabitants.
The persons who participate In the play
are paid a small sum. Christus gets
about 1000 marks for the season, and the
others scale down to small amounts. The
management is In the hands of a com
mittee and the local priest.
The plays are hold on Sundays and
feast days or holidays. The Income for the
season must be large. In 1S90 over 200.
000 people attended, and on aecount of the
increased travel to see the Paris Exp<*Â»i
tlon the attendance for 1900 will exceed
the previous one.
The erect, gracious and manly form of
Christus as he bends over his mother Is'

When this part of the play Is finished
the audience Is in tearsâ sobs and sighs
can be heard on every side.

ing of the curtain is the prologue, sung by
a choir headed by a grand and proud look
ing old man who stands at least six feet
two Inches high and whose maje&tlc
stride leaves a lasting impression on youc
mind. He Is called "Prolosaus," and he is
assisted by about forty slngcrB, untrained
and uncultivated, yet their music is be

The play begins at S:30 a. m. and con

lasts till 2 p. m. and the play finishes at
5:20 p. m. The scenes are so realistic that
the audience is often in tears. No inter
ruption by applause la permitted, and ap
proval Is only given at the end of the
performance.
The audience Is almost made up of
strangers who make pilgrimages from all
parts of the globe, and it is a thoroughly
cosmopolitan . gathering. Here you . can

eense to the other characters. The play
would have been perfect If the Madonna

has grown his hair and beard to look the
part. The cast contains over six hundred
people. The stage is enormous In size and
Is In the open air. The audlencÂ« are sheÂ»
tered under a covered depot shaped struc
ture which seats four thousand people.
The south rnd is open to the stage; the
mountains rise back ot the Etaue, the sky
and clouds and shades therefrom lend
reality to the scenes. The magnificence
of the costumes is worthy of highest com
mendation and when America's two great
est theatrical managers, Messrs. Haymin
and Frohroan, say they never saw any
thing: to excel It.lt must be accepted a*
a fact- The orchestra is placed below the
front of the Â«tagÂ© and out of Bight of the
audience. The main or center stage is
see sunns ride by side the Catholic J*rtS"rt
and Bishop, the Epbcopalian minister,
and, in fact, ministers of every denomi
nation, Israelites, Mohammedans, the
devout and indifferent Christians, maga
zine and newspaper correspondents, stu
dents, and In fact the mental culture of
every tongue could be gathered from
among the Â£rc&t audience that assembles.
The play docs not commence with the"
birth of Christ, but with his entrance on
an ass to Jerusalem: he is accompanied
by his couÂ«ln. St. John, and he Is first
seen where he 'drives the traders away
from the front of the temple. It is the
only time he displays anger or Keem3 hu
man. At all other times he is lowly and
meek. The character Is beautifully por
trayed by Anton^Lang, who looks ..he Bib
lical picture and acts It beyond criticism!
His manner Is simple, gentle arid kindly;
his voice is clear and sympatheticâ In fact,'
it is almost musical, and when he par
takes of the last supper the scene Is pa-
thetle, especially when he washes the feet
of his di.Â«dples and gives to them the
bread and wine.
rr be contrast of features betv/een all tha
other disciples and Judas Iscarlot Is one
no picture can portray. Judas Iscariot Is
one of the best-rendered in the play. No
trained actor of our times could play and
look the part as he does. In the scene
whfre fie repents his traitorous acts
toward his master he rises to grand
heights and, villain that he Is, he almost
invites forgiveness!
The dialogue gives an idea of the scene
enacted. Â¦ .

We took the train at Bloombury marked
Whitechapel and were thus plunged at
once into the slums. .The tramway itself
was a bit of the slums on wheels. As all
the places on top were, taken, we were
forced to go inside, an experience that
should have gratified forevermore the
most ambitious "slummer." I had my
jhoice of two places, one next to an old
woman peacefully sleeping away a "jag"
with a basket of fish on her lap; the oth
er by the side of a blear-eyed Individual
who was devouring a most unsavory mess
of strong cheese. To make a selfish selec
tion between these two possibilities would
have been difficult. I didn't try it; but
sank at random next to the fish woman,
leaving the cheesy corner to the pro
fessor. In a few moments the aged wo
man began to nod my way and to adjust
her basket at an angle favorable to dump
ing its contents In my lap. I tried to look
unconscious and, not to reveal the Â»ea-
Blckness that soon began to possess me,
for the lesson had been well taught me
that the slightest display of disgust might
lead to ,very disastrous consequences. I
realized the danger full well, yet now I
felt: that I should shriek should one of
those clammy dead fish tumble out upon
me. The fish were smelling to heaven most
persistently, for many days had flown
since they sported free of care,neath crys
tal waves. My neighbor on fhe other
side looked like a pickpocket In fact,
the more. that I looked at him the more
convinced I became, that such waa his

that he had never expected me to keep

cf the kodak. Â¦
"Probably," said the professor dryly,
"but you seem to forget that I shall have
future use for this six feet of manhood."
Then he began one of his characteristic
tirades against womankind in general.
For the professor Is an avowed woman
hater and to accuse us of our sex is the
most available way known to him of vent-
Ing his spite. He never had seen a
woman who could k<Â»ep an agreementâ
they always broke their word at the last
minute; they were . absolutely unreliable
and so on through the list of woman
hating invectives.
As we started out I made one last ap
peal for the kodak. "Please let me takf
it. I am sure that your six feet of man
hood will be able to protect me."
"Pull your hat over your eyes," I sug
gested, "and you may at least pass for
the 'polished villain.' Perhaps they will
forgive the 'polish' ti\ Whitechapel for
the sake of the villainy."
"Well. neither are you." I retorted, for
the professor was absolutely picturesque
in the garb that he had affected. With
a slouch hat, a low collar and a floating
necktie he looked like the hero of a Sat
urday afternoon melodrama.
"Much too respectable." he answered
dlscouragingly. "You're not a bit Whlte-

seem within the range of possibilities.
We planned our trip to Whitechapel for
Sunday morning, for. consistent In 'its
lawlessness, Whitechapel refuses to ob
serve the Sabbath, and Sunday is the
busy day. It is the market day and the
most interesting to the sightseer. A re
spectable London shop could not keep
open on Sunday were it so disposed. It
would soon be closed by the police, for
London is rigid In ita Sunday law. -But at
Whitechapel the police are powerles>.
Long ago it was discovered that this side
of London must simply be winked at by
the law.' It would hardly be practicable
to put a million people in jail, and even
were there no question of the feasibility of
this plan it would be doubtful as a disci
pline, for Jail to many of these White
chapel- people is a luxury. It means
something to eat and a place to sleep: in
winter it means protection from the cold.
In> visiting "Whitechapel you must take
your own chance: every one will tell you
that the police can offer you little or no
protection.

"On our side of the water we have a
theory that we take quite seriously," I
said at last to the professor, "that all
men are born equal."
We returned by a different route, past
the Bank of England and Saint Paul's
cathedral. The service at Saint Paul's
was just over and the people were pour
ing outâ that wonderfully well-dressed,
top-hatted, long-coated English crowd,
the most respectable and genteel In ap
pearance, perhaps, that you will find on
earth. We looked in silence, each of us
impressed with theÂ« ereatness and the
suddenness of the contrast.
. We wended our way through several
streets of this sort, past the markets
where old meat and vegetables cast off by
the cltv establishments are sold to this
starving population to whom anything la
acceptable that holds their wretched
bodies and souls together. I meant to
take a number of pictures in spite of the
professor, but I had not the heart, to say
nothing of the courage, to turn the kodak
on their misery. The few snap3 that I
was able to obtain were In the more de
cent corners.
Old men with moist eyes and red coses
and hands with crinkled skin and black
nails blinked their way along from one
shop to the other, probably with a penny
to spend and looking arduously for the
best bargain. Children, pale-faced and
starved, poor little pickpockets. 10 or 12
years of age, stood about in number*
awaiting their chances to steal. To grab
something at one end of the street and
run to the other and sell it Is the popu
lar trick. Every one knows that thÂ©
thlnj is stolen, but the sympathy of
W,hitechapel Is always with the thief.
He has a better chance to sell his wares
than the merchant. Whether this sym
pathy be in the atmosphere of White
chapel I know not, but at any rate I felt
myself catching It. This white-faced, big
eyed urchin, with wrinkles around his
eyes and lines about his mouth like a man
of 50. was the thief: this greasy, nosey,
lippy Jew was the merchant. Pernicious
though it may- have been, my heart welled
over for the little thief and I wished him
godspeed in his maneuvers. Most of these
youngsters boast the proud distinction of
being "known to the police," the' only
distinction, by the way. that is at all
available to the ambitious resident of
Whitechapel. Almost as soon as they
can walk or talk they are put on the list
as the "companions of thieves," as if
they could choose their companions, poor
little wretches. In all of this Jumble
cursing and swearing and the foulest
kind of language made the day hideous.
Although in the morning, hours drunkards
were everywhere apparent, asleep on the
sidewalks or staggering through the
streets. Puny, scabby babies, loathsome
little victims of filth and disease, clung
to the breasts of insensible, drunken
mothers.
In this fame street is a public house
that haa been famous for centuries as
the rendezvous of beggars. Here at
night the lame man throws away his
crutch and the blind man sees and high
carnival is held after a day's successful
Imposition. Here, also, he who is suf
ficiently ambitious may enjoy the real
privilege of meeting a real live burglar,
not in the dark with a mask and a lant
ern, but socially. He may smoke a pipe
with him and listen to tales of his dar
ing deeds. For the burglar to the people
of Whitechapel Is a "jolly good fellow."

great slum center as we had imagined.
In twenty minutes we arrived at Middle

lane, a corner that is unique and famous
throughout the world. It la the region
of old clothes In the most Inconceivable
abundance. Old boots and shoes wera
piled In pyramids or banked against im
provised walls all the length of the street
Old coats, old hats and bonnets, men's
and women'*: faded old cotton frocks,
probably the cast-off of servants, were dis
played In proud arrav. The sellers of
these wares were mostly Jews, oily,
slimy, obr.oxious-lookliig individuals with
huge noses, elaborate watch chains and
dirty hands. The cheapness of their wares
can hardly be imagined. It being possible
to buy a complete outat. shoes included,
for less than a shilling. And the buyers,
poor things. I think I shall see them for
ever. Women with pallid faces, half
defiant and half deatnlike In their ex
pression, lingered enviously over pasts
diamonds and make-betieve turquoir-e.
Loud-mouthed old termagants shook their
fists in the faces of the Jew3 and hag
gled over the difference of a ha'penny In
the price of cotton frocks.

In comparison. I think of the poor In
Ireland, huddled indiscriminately Into

akin to comfort possesses me. After all,
there are companionship and love and
pympathy in this miscellaneous Jumble;
there is a suggestion of comfort In the

a. possible pride, a sense of ownership

Blake looks, poor fellow â¢ Where has he

These attendants, tosether with a score
cf mafooo riding their masters' second
mnur.ts. formed a croup at the side of
the grand stand. Among them might have
been noticed a handsome and handsomely
dressed boy, lounging videsaOdle fashion
on a ema.ll pÂ°r.y which belonged to Mr.
Pericords stable. The boy was probably

He had thrown one iep over the pommel
of his saddle in order lo watch the race3

Lady Macdonald looked around at him

and unemotional diolcmatist seemed to
be positively quivering with anger. He
left his seat and gave a v/hlsjiered order
In Russian to his attache. Captain Vas

"Vfe, master."

He unconsciously does his best to precipi
tate the gathering outbreak. It was a
dictum of Anson Burllngamc that half
the bitter. hatred of Chinese to foreigners
Is the cumulative result of the strangers'
overbearing manner, and this has grown
truer every day during forty years. A
Chinaman never forgets the "loss of
face," which Is implied by an unretaliated
blow, and these blows have been freely
distributed of late by the swarm of new
comers who care nothing for native sus
ceptibilities. Germany, for instance, will
not wipe out the memory of her sailors'
high-handedness for many decades,
though she rules Shantung with a stick

awful upheaval, and the ministers were
busying themselves about the construc

Mr. Pericord sat In his office gazing at

one addressed two days before to t!iÂ»
French Minister by Bishop Favier. Vicar
Apostolic at 'Peking, ft was dated the
19th of May. ltÂ«A and ran as follows:
"Mr. Minister: Prom day to day the
situation becomes more serious anil
threatening. In the Prefecture of Pao
tinp-Fu more thnn seventy Christians
have been massacred; near Ieheou only
three days ago Hirer- neophytes were cut
in pieces. Many villages have been pil

"Under these circumstances, Mr. Minis

responsibility for his services. Of course.
it Is well understood that you cannot
officially undertake to protect us foreign
devils. As a devotion-inspiring autocrat,
you beat even my friend Cecil Rhodes."
"I confess that you bewilder me. Sir
Claude. Would you be kind enough to
explain how any member of the revenue
service has been able to reassure you con
cerning these riots?"
"Certainly. It happened on the day of
the cup race. Your rzan. w.ho is an,
American, sent a note to Conger to meet
him behind the stables during the sec

friend, beckoned to me to accompany him.
In this way we did the whole thing in
fifteen minutes without any of our boys,
coolies or linguists being any the wiser.
Your manâ a fine fellow; you chose your
Instrument wellâ has managed to pet Into
the confidence of Tuan's rlghthand man.
Tunjr, by serving him as a drill instruc
tor. He gave us positive assurance that
Tuan meant to shut the gates of Peking
on us at the beginning of June, when an
attcek was to be made on Tientsin while
we were being: held as hostages if It failed.
Mr. Unattached added that the Boxer ras
cals would probably get out of hand and
try to massacre us. I have lost no time
in laying in sand and provisions, I assure
you."
"My warningâ three weeks ago? I wish
I could recollect anything of the sort.
What do you refer to?"
"But. my dear Mr. Pericord." said Sir
Claude, who appeared far from upset by
the S. G.'s warning:, "you seem to forget
your own good deeds. Your foresight Is so
Infallible that !t has become a second na
ture'to you, and your right does not know
what your left i? doing. I assure you that
I acted promptly on your warning of three
weeks ago and am quite ready for our
truculent Prince."
Tuan had virtually volunteered the In
formation that ever since the Japanesa
war he had been reorganizing the army
with the distinct intention of declaring 1
war against all foreign powers In. order to
reclaim the sovereign rights abandoned by
his brother Hslen Feng. The treaties
which admitted the right of foreigners to
travel In the interior, to live in separate
settlements under extraterritorial Juris
diction and to have their representatives
resident in Peklug were to be abrogated.
Evidently the manner of effecting this
would be, not by an honorable declaration
of war, but by instigating the people to
massacre. In fact, the war had already
been in progress a month and it might at
any moment culminate in an attack on
Legation street. It was too late to do any
thing save warn the Ministers to flee. The
S. G. was a Chinese statesman, the
Prince's confidence had been given to him
as to a loyal servant of the throne, and
It was impossible for him to betray that
confidence. But If only he had known thl3
a month earlier.
He called privately on the British Jlin
lster.
It may be Imagined that Mr. Pericord
found food for the most anxious thought
in this revelation of the Prince's purpose.

"I am grateful for the confidence your
Highness has reposed In me," Mr. Perl
cord said gravely, as If this extraordinary
confession were the most natural thing
in the world. "I need not say that It will
be held sacred. Nevertheless. I have to
beg that you will consider the courtesies
of war and warn the foreign Ministers
to leave Peking before their personal safe

"Let them use their own discretion on

"Enough, your Highness." Interposed
the S. G. peremptorily. "They are my
fellow-countrymen- duty forbids that
I should leave Pekins even If my ser
vices did not insure respect to my office.
As a high officer of the state my humble
counsel remains always at your Hlgn
ness' disposal. The war you are about to
levy will be the downfall of your house.
It Is my duty to express that opinion and
my duty Is done."
"And right manfully, too, by the beard
of Kang Hsl! Rest assured that I respect
and honor you, Mr. Pericord. Good
night."
As the Prince was about to leave tna
room Kuel-lien darted forward and. pros
trating himself, burst into a long and
passionate harangue In support of the S.
G.'s arguments. Tuan listened with unex
pected patience. Then he lifted the lad
by the hand.
"What, you, too, boy? You. whose moth
er Is. next to my own royal stepmother,
the bravest patriot of them all? Verily,
the Tsung Shul-wu Ssu casts a spell upon
all who serve him. You shall enter thÂ©
service of my son when the splendor of
the throne shines once more untarnished
by the presence of presumptuous foreign
ers. So fear not."
"My service is pledged elsewhere, your
Highness," said Kuel-lien sadly.
"And your heart, too, girl," whispered
the Prince, not unkindly*, suddenly grasp
ing the boy's shoulder and looking dosely
In his face. Then he laughed gruffly and
strode away.
"Even then I might havÂ»> gone.no fur

when the rumors of this Intrigue found
their way Into Legation street the Minis

that they considered themselves the re
gency and Kuang Hsu their* nominee.
That decided me. In the preoccupations
of politics and war I had almost forgotten
my oath. The audacious presumption of
these foreignersâbut I do not Include your
Greatness }n that term â has sealed their
fate. T'"*,., must be driven from Peking."

"Not until 1S02. when the rebellion of
the Ko Lao Hui and the Manchu Vegeta
rians seemed to betoken an awakening of
the nation to some vague sense of pa
triotism, did I consent to take up my. resi
dence in Peking. The war with Japan
opened my eyes to the fact that all my
energy in training men to the use of bow
and spear had been wasted and that noth
ing could save my country but magazine
rifles. Although I abhor all things that
are foreign. I have thrown my energies.
Into the task of rearming and reorganiz
ing the army, assisted by trusty lieuten
ants like Yuan. This occupied me for
three.* years. . Â«~ . -..*.._ -
"ThenTTeallzed that the time had come
to take the great step of placing my son
on the throne. During' my long absence
the hated spirit of' foreign Innovation, as
you have Just to!Â«I mn. had. begun to in

I discovered, to my horror, that the puny
Emperor himself was secretly reading all

by electricity and steam. When Kuans
Hsu appended the vermilion signature to
the outrageous proclamation prepared by
Kang Yu-wel I hesitated no longer. I en
tered the apartments of my aged s!ster-in
law and called upon her once more to ex
ercise her power to save the empire from
clipping out of our hands. The result was
what you know. Kuarg Hsu was seques
tered on an island In the iake and the
Government wns once more declared to be

"Then 1 swore an oath to avenge my

said to me: 'Ko Ko, never forget this day.

perform the sacred rites to his father."
"Be sure that I sympathize with your
Highness' ambition," replied M. Pericord,
quietly. "It is not In my province to
concern myself with palace Intrigues. But
ambition does not necessitate fanaticism.
Why must your Highness connect a state
intrigue with an anti-foreign crusade?"
CHAPTER XX.
PRINCE TTJAX.
The Prince was evidently affected by
the peculiar power of the S. G. to extract
confidence.
"I will tell your Greatness, and you will
understand why the throne itself is a
small thing beside my patriotism.
When I was still a boy of 10
years of age in I860 my beloved
brother, the sainted Emperor . listen
Feng, was forced to flee northward
by the approach of the French and British
invaders. The allies. Instead of pursuing
us, revenged themselves by the wanton
destruction of my brother's summer pal
ace, the gardens of the Yuan-Ming Yuan.
This insult and the defeat of his army
broke my brother's heart. A palace was
seized within the Imperial City as a resi
dence for the British Envoy. The Em
peror declared he would never return
while his capital was contaminated by the
foreigners' presence. On the 17th of Au

overcame him and he died.

EXPERIENCE OF A SAN FRANCISCO GIRL
IN MEXICO
Continued on Page Nineteen, '"'-
From . Torreon we went directly to tho
City of Mexico, making no stops en route.
The villages were more numerous as we
proceeded - south and there . was evi
dence of better civilization and more
prosperity.
The essentials of every Mexican town
are a cathedral and a plaza and about
these cluster the low, flat-roofed adobe
houses, with tiled or thatched roofs.
While always quite plain on the exterior,
the. courts are often gay with flowers
and fountains. In some places the cacti
are utilized for fences. The organ cacti
sake understand, we appealed to the pro
prietor for our letters.
"Why! â¢ Didn't you- look in your letter
box?" he said.
, Well,. that was. something new. we had
'not been introduced : to. We were then
shown a row. of little boxes,, one bearing
our Dames, and there our letters had been
One la suddenly' recalled to the present
day -as the train; stop and a dozen-men
eagerly besiege you for your valises in the
hope of a small fee. -: En route : we had
heard ', so , many stories of the disappear
ance of small baggage and other articles
not well guarded, that -: instinctively, we
followed close at the heels of our porter.
I have seen a man carry a heavy bureau
through the streets on his head.
Each stopping place furnishes some
thing of Interest. At Aguas Callentes th<Â»
men and women, besiege you to buy beau
tiful drawnwork. At Salamanca the
specialty Is straw sombreros nnd baskets.
At Irapuato you are tempted with deli
cious strawberries, arranged in llttlo.
baskets. They, are sold here every day
in the year. Queretaro is noted for
opals. What we had always thought of'
asjireclous stones we soon began' to looli
upon as mere pebbles. It Is the old prin
ciple of the unattainable being dcsirabl'
You arc offered several opals for a feÂ»
dollars; as the time approaches for th.
departure of the train the price of opal,
falls, as the train is pulling out of tht
station you can get a -whole handful ot
opals for almost your own price. . But, bo
sure you have the right amount in your
hand, for it is'good-by to change. There
is a pie station, a candy station, another
where ' queer mechanical toys are i sold,
and all these surprises add variety to thÂ«
trip.
At- last we reach the City of Mexico,
the Mecca of all tourists.
.There is a. sense of -awe. on 'first .'enter
ing this city, centuries old, whose ro
mantic history reads like a fairy tale.
This capital, which has for more than five
hundred years been successively ruled by
conqueror, viceroy, emperor, dictator - or
president. . â¢
Bgement lo our guide llrÂ»nk, that assured
us we would lmd the elJmate of the City
of Mexico delightful, in .Inly. August and
September. And sn< - h we loun'd to bs the
case.
One forgets to take Into consideration
the altitude, of from 3TO0 to 7000 feet,
Â¦which has such a wonderful Influence In
moderating the olimate: and also the
many snow-capped mountains in the vi
cinity of Mexico City.
The summer months are certainly most
riesirable for a trip to Mexico, leaving
out of account the plac-rs on the coast.
As it is the rainy season one can travel
in comfort. -The country, which r month
l>efore v.-as dry. parched and dusty*. Is
now beautiful and bright with grasses
end flowers.
It is difllcult to realize that almost at
our door Is a country so foreign In every,
respect. In no place on the Continent
can one flnd more interesting scenes und >
Rights. Tho country itself, with its strange'
growth of cacti and palms, seems a fit
ting background for the p'.cturesoue peo
p!e and the cualnt little adobe villages.
We entered Mexico via Eagle Pass.
Hourly the journey became of more in
terest. We hardly accustomed ourselves
to the novelty of cotton fields before we
found purJMdYM whirling through uncul
tivated tracts, picturesque with palms and
fantastic-shaped cacti; then by another
sudden transition we were ia the midst
of the familiar corn fields.
The native Mexican at work In the
fields gives a bright touch of color to the
landscape.
The f*o*tumÂ« of the Mexican Indian 13
extremely picturesque. The men are in
variably dressed In white eottpn. the in
evitable broad sugar-loaf sombrero and
sandals, and the complete costume In
cludes the serape, a gayly colored blanket
thrown about the shoulders. The women
wear all colors of the rainbow, with a
cotton scarf, usually blue or brown,
which serves as wrap and headgear.
Our first stop was at Torreon. Accord-
Ing to the guide book the place Is of Im
portance as a railroad Junction and good
eating station: also as a manufacturing
center. But to us it was of interest in a
widely different vray. . ._
It was our first introduction to the "re
cfiptlon committee." seemingly a neces
sary part of every well-regulated Mexi
can elation. The people come to meet the
trains, and crowd about the depot with
takes and various Spanish dishes to selL
<And this Is the only wise thing to do If
you ever expect to see your valise again.)
We were piloted safely -to carriages.
There are three classes of carriages, with
tlxed prices. The blue flag indicates the
f'.rst cla.-Â«s. the red Hag the second class
and the yellow flag the third class. Both
the first ami second classes are good.
We reached the Ifotcl Iturbide in com
fcrt, which is more than can be said of
the Englishman, who gave his grip to
the porter, also his check for a trunk.
The fellow put the trunk on his head
and started out of the depot. The Eng
lishrrfcin, with hjs< limited vocabulary of
"Spanish did not make the man under
stand to get a carriage; instead, the fel
low had visions of a big fee, and calm
|ly trotted up the two miles to the hotel
with the trunk on his head, while nothing
was left for the Englishman to do but to
run and keep up with his luggage.
i The Hotel Iturbide was formerly the
; palace of the Emperor Iturbide. It is
a palatial building, but all the magnifi
cent furniture has been Ions since re
; moved. If one is at all inclined to be
: romantic, the hotel will afford more com
forts than otherwise. However, it is
Â¦cne of the best in Mexico, built on the
'usual plan, the rooms opening on to large
; courts. I
I Our arrival was duly announced by
I having our names added to the list on the
I blackboard in the office.
From that day until your departure you
are not expected to be seen or heard from.
"We waited In vain for our letters. After
three days, having persistently questioned
every bellboy and attendant we could
safely reposing rvr days. That Is only
Â¦one of the many surprises one meets.
Sunday is tne gala day in Mexico. The
tourist is out bright nnd early to see the
sights. The tirst place to visit is the
market. Within a large inclosure are nu
merous improvised booths, where all sorts
of things are displayed for sale, from old
brasses, candlesticks and curiosities to
lompt'the stranger to the plain, substan
tial articles to satisfy the wants of tha
lower- classes. This is the shopping day
of the peasant, when he buys the neces
saries of life for the week, and he cer
tainly seems to enjoy bargaining.
Cleanliness is not a virtue of the lower
classes, and one often finds oneself In
stinctively trying to shrink into a smaller
space to avoid brushing against these
gayly colored serapes.
Next one pays a visit to the flower mar
ket. This is most attractive, and the
Mexican displays much taste in the ar
rangement of Qowerm However, they still
cling to the funeral wreaths made of
beads; but then that is not strange when
even artistic Paris, with all her advance
ment In art. still ornaments her graves
with these same kind of wreaths.
The cathedral must be visited on Sun
clay even if one has been there at other
times. The better classes are la attend
ance then. The middle classes wear a
black tapola, a shawl that serves for hat
and wrap. The women of high, degree
still wear the Spanish mantilla of black
lace in place of a bonnet.
The Mexicans are very devout Catholics,
and at all times can be seen In the
churches. A peculiarity of the churches
is that there is no arrangement made for
seating the congregation. The worship
ers stand or kneel during: the entire serv
ice. The usual number of beggars are to
be found about the door, ready to invoke
a blessing upon the generous-minded per
son. AftT this hour on Sunday no onÂ©
seems to {rive thought to religion. Rich
and poor alike seek for amusement. The
Government docs much to provide pleas
ure for the people by burnishing bands af
music In many parts of the city. The
plaza facing the cathedral is mostly fre
quented by the poorer people, while the
Alamrda and the Paseo are the rendez
vous for the rich people.
One hears so much about the plazas
and alamedas of Mexico that I must con
fess my expectations wore high and con
sequently 1 was f.ued to be a little bit
disappointed in that particular. Possibly
my beinjr a ("nlifornian and accustomed,
to such a variety and luxurious growth
of flowers and shrubs may account for my
disappointment. The guide books expati
ate at length upon the charm of these
plazas, -with the tropical growth of plants,
the people gayly dressed and promenad
ing to the strain? of sweet music, but we
have a number of rlties in the interior
thnt on "cenc-rt night" can rival Mexico.
From 11 o'clock to 1 p. m. on Sundays
the scene of attraction Is the Alameda.
A canopy has been stretched as a protec
tion from tho midday sun over a long,
broad path, which i.* lined with chairs.
Those who wish to sea come early, and
for n few cents obtain seats In a desirable
location. v*ith a view of the band stand,
in a bower of banana and other tropical
plants.
?non the crowd commences to arrive,
and gradually increases until two distinct
processions pass and repass. the men
and women invariably in separate groups.
Here only the better clas3Â»s are seen.
The picturesque Indian with his sombrero
and bright-colored serape rarely offers to
intrude upon Â»his scene, but stands at a
distance and looks on. At 1 o'clock the
Alameda Is deserted, the people returning
to their hnmci for dinner. At- 4 o'clock
driving begins on the Paseo, and this Is
truly a brilliant scene. Everybody drives
and everybody puts on the best clothes
for tljls oceas'on.
The Pasfo iÂ«Â» a broad boulevard two
and a half miles long. The carriage way
is shaded by great trees, two rows on each
side. At intervals the Paseo widens, and
here are placed statues of the nation's he
roes. Along the drive are some of the
most beautiful hcires of the city. At the
end of the Paseo rises the hill and castle
of Chapultepec, surrounded by a forest of
cypress, which Is unsurpassed for mag
nificence. These grand old trees date back
over twenty centuries; they tower in
majesty above the ordinary growth. Tha
dim aisles beneath are made beautiful by
the numerous pepper trees. One cannot
exaggerate the beauty of the castle of
Chaputepec and its surroundings. It Is
now the residence of President Diaz; it la
the Mexican White House.
Driving Is continued until a late hour
on San Francisco street. This Is only a
faint idea of Sunday in Mexico City. On
week days the tourist can find innumer
able attractions. One has only to con
sult his taste. It may be a trip to a
suburban town or to Guadalupe. the holi
est shrine in Mexico. There are numerous
and interesting legends in regard to this
chapel.
Streetcar service fs exceedingly good It\
the City of Mexico. The cars are first
second and third class, also baggage cars*
and. what seems strangest of all to us'
funeral cars. These latter cars are Â«r*
ranged similarly to a hearse. They stor>

Mating plains or In the ranch house when
there was nobody around to notice. Not
that anybody would have noticed, any
way. He was on the Jesus Maria ranch
then, ar.d the Jerus Maria, people thought
he was just one cf the boys, and they
never paid any attention.
A cowboy artist is unique â so unique
that at first nobody recognized what he
was. Nobody was looking for sharp stud

vof the boys. When he was discovered
those who had been blind began to blink
thfir eyos and a?k questions.
"Where- did you learn?" they asked.
"Outdoors," he answered in his blunt
way. Hf hates to be bothered with fool
ish questionsâ or any questions, for the
matter of that. When you begin to ask
them he aJwajg begins to squirm as If
he were in a depperaie hurry, and he looks
fcr his hat. and you have to hang upon
his metaphorical ccattails to get any
th\VK more out of him.
"Who taught you? " people asked when

"Wh<-n did you do It?" put in some
body who had had a claim upon his time.
"After the cattle were corra'lfd," he
said, tartly. He had the right to be
tart-
Over in his own little Oakland studio he
forgot to be in a hurry and to wriggle
away, and he told all about the way he
came to draw pictures. Away from there
he Is as restless as a cat in a strange gar
ret. Chase him to his dwelling place, and
he cuddles down and purrs. It takes the
environment of the eld serape and the
rattler's skin and the Mexican saddle and
Â£ix-fhooter to quiet him.

pieces) up the eides of bis trousers; elab-
orate silver buckles on his waistcoat, a
Bilk shirt and sash and pointed shoes
complete his costume. He is then quite
ready "to play the bear." This playing
th* bear is a custom peculiar to Mexico.
Social conditions are bo different there.
A young lady has no freedom outside of
the family. You will see a smiling sen
orita at the barred windows of her home.
She. is the Juliet, and the Romeo of this
little play paces up and down in front of
the balcony, casting tender glances at his
lady love.
It is from this walking to and fro like
a caged animal that the name, "playing
the bear." is given to this sort of flirta
tion.
There is a large foreign population in
Mexico and most of the enterprises are
controlled by foreign capital. The coun
try- Is rich in agriculture and mines, but
the native Mexican is too lazy to care to
profit by his advantages.
The lower classes are particularly indo
lent. Wages are small, from twelve and
a half cents to seventy-nve cents a day,

but It Jb quite sufficient for the modest
wants of the people. . A foreigner, who
thought It an injustice to pay laborers
such a email sum, raised the wages of his
men. with the result that they would only
work four Instead of six days; that was
quite enough to supply all their necessi
ties, and they could rest the other days.
The Mexican Indian. wKh all the influ
ence of the numerous Â¦ churches, has not
yet learned that honesty Is a virtue. This
class is addicted to petty thieving, and
they are experts according to the numer
ous stories told. I was amused. In going
into a drug store and a candy- store, to
see the chairs, the door mats and cus
pidors chained to the floor. It seems the
only limit to the possibilities of â¢ these
rogues is a red hot stove. The national

novelty ot the affair, even if the play can-

are sufficiently entertained you buy your

acls the men stand and amuse themselves
by staring at the ladles. The' senorita
who has the most opera glasses leveled
at her is the belle of the evening.
But with the many strange and interest
ing sights of the City of Mexico we must
say goodby. I can only speak hastily of
a few 'side trips.
The one to Orizaba should certainly not
be omitted.
Â¦ As we leave the city behind we - soon
find ourselves in the midst of 'fields of
the maguey plant, known commonly U
us asjhe century plant." Far' as the eye
can rfach nothing -but these rows- and
rows of cacti. From' th'e Bap of this plant
Is made pulque, the national drink.
â¢ Pulque ' making (and drinking) is ". an
enormous business. It is estimated that
the City of Mexico consumes 100,000, pints
dally. It \3 a drink that will keep
but a few days. Perhaps that may ac
count for the Intoxicated condition or
many people â the desire nqt to let a goo'l
thing waste.
At Aplzaco the train stops long enough
to allow one to buy a cane carved by the
Pueblo Indians. These canes are made ot
coffee wood and are carvecl to represent
the various stages of a bullfight. *
As we approach Orizaba the scenery
becomes magnificent. iThe track lies on
the side of the mountains, winding In and
put In sharp curves, through tunnels, over
bridges, with canyons hundreds of feet be
low. This road is considered one of the
greatest pieces of railroad engineering in
the world." -
Orizaba is a beautiful quaint little city
of .-20,000 .Inhabitants, .situated 186 miles
from the City of Mexico. The houses are
mostly one-story ..with, red tiled roofs. /I:
one or tne most productive sections or
Mexico, where cotton, coffee and sugar

beautiful and fantastic designs.
A day spent at Aguas Callentes is one
of my most delightful reminiscences ui
the trip. It is a quaint, sleepy old town.
Aguas Callentes translated means hot
waters, and the name is well chosen, as
there are numerous hot springs in tfce
vicinity. The place Is famed for its baths,
both public and private.' Go to the prim
itive baths near the springs.- As you ap
proach you think what a strange build
ing on the side on the hill, or rather it
looks like dozens of little houses, of all
sizes and shapes. Joined together. But
I was conducted to a dres3ing-room and
off this was an Immense bath. large
enough to swim In and approached by
marble stairs. The water for this bath
was supplted by a natural hot spring,
bubbling up In the room. An Inspection
of the thirty-eight other baths found no
two alike. Each had the temperature or
the water marked above the dpor.

Uses oF the Lemon.
Sick headaches may often bÂ© cured by
taking half the Juice of one lemon in a

sometimes yield to the simple treatment

Lemon Juice zvsd e~ far mixed very thick

coughs and colds. Hot lemonade is also
rmjd-but the very'best form In which, the
lemon can be used for such cases Is the
following: Put a good sized lemon In the
Oven and let it remain there until thor
oughly baked It will then be soft all
through. Take it out and add enough
sugar or honeyâ honey is preferableâ to
make a thick syrup with the juice. Keep
this warm and take, a teaspoonful every

When you make a hot lemonade for a

There has been fighting also in Leyte and
Samar, and General MacArthur reported j
yesterday the ambush of flfty-on-e men of
Company F of the Twenty-ninth Infantry
in the Island of Marinduque in San Ber

Army officers insist that tLe situation no
longer admits of pacificatory treatment;
that the insurgents must be taught a
sharp lesson, or emboldened by the suc
cess of their guerilla warfare they will

orders to Manila arrive at that point and
can be distributed among. the Islands.
Administration officials continued to In-
slst that the Insurgent successes are due.

of the government of the city of Manila:
"Existing orders requiring residents â¢?
the city of Manila to confine themselves
to "their homes after 10 p. m. are hereby

after which hour the itreets of the city
will be cleared by the police. Saloons will

is prohibited after that hour."
NEW YORK. Sept 29.â Mrs. Conger, wife of the United States Minister to China, has sent another letter In dlary'form
to her sister at Des Molnes. under date of Peking. June 11; She. says:
"We had a rather laughable fright this morning. It may, however, have good'effect. The Chinese soldiers do almost
nothing against the Boxers, but too much to encourage them. Mr. Cheshire of this legation was going in our cart to the
Tsung-11 Yamen. and two Boxers in uniforms with weapons came out from a by-slroet and screamed at him, then ran down
Legation street, screaming and waving their spears, striving to rally the others lrf large numbers. They passed by some
German soldiers and .the German Minister. They ran after them and caught one: Two soldiers, one on either side, took Â¦
him to the. German legation. Baron von Ketteler followed, pounding. the man on the head with a club.
"About 10 p. m. the members (four) of the Tsung-H Yamen entered our gates. . It was no easy matter for them to get
through the lines with their chairs. They were very friendly. 1 They said that at 5 o'clock they, were at the palace and that'
the Empress Dowager and Emperor wished, them to come to. the United States legation, as it was friendly to China, and
to say that they deeply regretted what had happened in the firing, etc., and to promise that It shall stop. Mr. Conger told E
them that they were repeating the same 6M story. They did not stop it. Their people have, been murdering our people, '.'
destroying and burning property, and the danger threatens everywhere, and If our troops had not been here the legation
would have. been sacrificed. They asked and urged that the coming troops go Into camp outside the city gates. Mr.. Conger
most positively said: 'No. they will come to the legation." and If they. are not enough plenty more will come, and if one
member of this legation Is harmed my Government will sweep down,upon yew and wipe' you off tho face of the earth.'
"They replied:"It shall not be. We know foreign soldiers are better than ours.*
"Mr. Conger told them: 'All we desire is peace, protection and harmonious relations , with your people. You .do not
give it to us. We foreign nations are obliged to call upon our countries for the protection.' that you should give us; You/
â¢ promise protection, but do not give it. "We must bring our 'soldiers to our legations." and If necessary. bring more and still'
more. Your people are so afraid "of the Boxers that it Is with difficulty we can send a messenger with a messageto the
TBung-11 Yamen.V'V . , ,
Mrs. Conger concludes: "Our ways are to us best. Chinese ways are to them best. -My dear sister, between, you and "
me, I think tbem an abused people. I cannot- see they are any better-off for having this .foreign element coming in upon
t them; it. is an outward attachment, whl<jh does not seem to. go Into their lives and modify them.,. It< has taken. years to
have an appearance of growth in it. It seems to me,"iat first ncovocatloh, that the appearance la shaken off arid that' the
real Chinaman is still. there." >. Â¦ ~ .- ; ,'- . :; â¢ , . ' *.
it was two days ago.' This was taken as
an indication that the railroads and others
with stocks of coal on hand regard an
early settlement of the miners', strike as
probable. The railroad officials, however,
refused to say to what point the negotia
tions to this end had progressed, but it;
was learned that the operators have prac
tically agreed not to entirely ignore the
union in making a settlement. The present
plan is believed to be to place conces
sions before the men at the different col
lieries and to ask them to return to work
pending the settlement of remaining, dif-"
ferences by arbitration. Â¦
The extent- to which the miners' organi
zation Is to be recognized Is said to be
that the men will have operators' terms
placed before them at meetings of the
local unions. According to a Wall-street
tie-as agency, there will not be a uniform
rate of Increase proposed throughout the
district, owing to varying conditions of
mining at different places, but there. will
be no advance of less than 10 per cent on
present wages. . -i >Â¦
Much interest was felt here In the con
ference held in Shenandoah, Pa., this af
ternoon between General Gobin, Sheriff
Toole and representatives of the opera
tors and miners. .The railroad officials
here expressed the belief that with the
militia out of the way it would bo easier
to come to an agreement with the strik
ers.
One of the sales agents of the Lehlgh
Valley Coal Company said that a few men
had charge of. the plans for a settlement
Of the strike, and that until the result is
accomplished they will not discuss the
affair:
The Evening Post says to-day:
"While no final announcement of the
coal strike settlement is yet forthcoming,
there Is to-day reliable authority for the
statement that the matters still under
discussion are of detail merely and that a
satisfactory conclusion will be reached in
a short time. It Is conceded everywhere
in the coal trade that the price of coal
after the strike will never settle down to
tho same level as before. More than 10
per cent increase in wages is believed gen
erally to be the. concession' the miners will
demand, and this will .mean, according to
reliable estimates, an increase of fully 23
cents in the cost of every ton" mined. This
will make the cost at the collieries about
$2 75 per ton. The consumer, of course,
will pay the difference. Moreover, there
will probably be a' great demand for coal
as soon as the strike is over, and perhaps
a week or ten days' delay in supplying
it."

MRS. CONGER DECLARES THE
CHINESE ARE ABUSED PEOPLE
Although he has diplomatically evaded'
the question, there Is a strong belief here
that Mr. Mitchell Is kept fully advised of
the progress of events in tne metropolis.
If the reported advance of 10 per cent
has been finally agreed upon It has not.
so far as can be learned, been offered to
any of the mine workers In the anthra
cite region. Taking Mr. Mitchell's state
ment that a 10. per cent advance would
not be satisfactory as an Indication that
it would not .be accepted by the miners'
organization, it Is thought in some quar
ters here that there would-be a break In
the ranks of the strikers which It would
be difficult to . stop should the offer to
their employes be made by the operators.
On . the other hand, President Mitchell
and his colleagues positive in assert
ing their belief that the men now idle will
not waver, and that they would stand to
gether until the joint convention of the
three anthracite districts call the strike
off.
The entire Lehigh Valley was about as
quiet to-day as it could possibly be. Rain
Is falling here to-night. The same num
ber of collieries were working as were in
operation yesterday. Both sides to the
contest claim accessions to their ranks in
the Hazleton district.
President. Mitchell said to-day that his
telegram to the soft coal region of Cen
tral Pennsylvania requesting mine work
ers there not to load coal cars which are
destined for s the; anthracite coal market
has had the desired effect.
Bit YAN FAVORS ARBITRATION.
Says That Is the, Proper Way to Set-
tie the Coal Miners' Strike.
CROOKSTON. Minn.. Sept. 29.â In re
sponse to a question In regard to the ad
visability of . arbitration . as a means of
settling the strike in the anthracite coal
region. Mr. Bryan said to-day:
"Arbitration Is the only Justifiable
means of adjusting disputes between cor
porate employers and their employes.
While arbitration Is usually asked by the
employes. It. ought tobe acceptable to
the employers if they believe they are
treating the miners fairly! and it ought to
be demanded by the public generally, be
cause every great strike affects the public
at large more than it does either the em
ployers or the employes. Those who re
fuse arbitration confess that they are not
prepared to submit their arguments to an
impartial tribunal."

DYNAMITE HAS BEEN USED

miners. The question of the recognition
of the union is regarded by many as the
key to the situation.
Some of the smaller individual operators
are much put out because they have not
been called Into the conferences recently
held by the representatives of the big
companies and had their advice asked.
They say they' have relatively just as
much at stake as the large companies and
that it would be no more than right If
they were consulted.
Ex-Congressman Norman "B." Williams.'

"So far as my company Is concerned, I

MITCHELIj IS NOT TALKATIVE.
Says" Strikers Are Closing the Mines
and Awaiting Developments.
-HAZLETON, Pa., Sept. 29.â "We are
closing the mines and awaiting develop
ments," was air that President Mitchell
of the United Mine Workers would say
to-night when asked whether he had re
ceived any Information from New. York
or elsewhere as to what the operators are
doing in their efforts to settle the strike.
PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 23â Late
developments shov.-'that the efforts
\j> bring about a hurried settlement
of the big coal miners' strike are
still In a chaotic condition. While
there is every surface evidence of honest
intention on the part of- the mine owners
and operators to grant the more impor
tant demands of the mine workers, the
difficulties In detail in reaching the basis
of a settlement grow more confusing.^ In
a conference to-night at WUkesbarre, an
important residential point of mining and
railroad superintendents and big individ
ual mine operators, mine foremen were
railed in to take part In the discussion.
The foremen were questioned relative to
the charge for powder, dockage, etc.. In
dicating that the owners were endeavor
ing to reach acommon ground where jus
tice 'would be found for each' side. So far
as can be learned no definite conclusion
was reached.
The general opinion among those In a
position to comprehend the' differences Is
that the settlement of the striko is yet re
mote. All interests involved, however,
stem to be willing to reach an early set
tlement, and concessions. It is understood,
will be readily accorded by both sides in
the controversy.
The strike leaders are cautious In their
movement?, but, so far as can be learned,
have not taken the ground that trickery
was being planned, a cautionary notice of
which point they had previously sent to
all the strikers.
It has now apparently settled Itself
down to a common sense discussion of the
differences.
The strikers made big gains to-day in
drawing out men . who have heretofore
continued at work.
The Markle employes to-night sent word
to the nrm that arbitration was not to
be further considered. So many of the
employes of that firm in its five mines
near Hazleton have Joined the strikers
that they concluded there was no ad
vantage to be gained by their argument
that the men would continue at work
pending arbitration of their grievances,
which had been presented to the firm
wholly apart from the general grievances
of the United Mine Workers. This was
their escape from the conditions of the
agreement and they concluded to declare
all previous agreements ended.
The entire region was tranquil to-day
'and General Gobln, In command of th^
three regiments of State troops in Schuyl
kill County, concluded that the soldiers
were only Idling away their time and he
Informed the Sheriff that he would send
one of the regiments home on Monday.
The strike leaders continued their cam
paigning by mass-meeting to-day and
they and many who have been working
joined their ranks. There were to-day
more idle mine workers than at any time
since the strike began.

expected, flow from the degradation of the
responsible authors of the Boxer out

Impress upon the imperial authorities the
necessity of establishing and preserving
peace and order and punishing those
guilty of the crimes committed.

peace in the provinces of Southern China,
disaffection in which has existed and
which it was apprehended would be the

There, has been considerable criticism

American policy as Indicated by the impe

tian Endeavor Society last night. Dr.
Temple was invited from Seattle as ono

subject. Spirit cf Service." While
the address was a very eloquent one, it
was argued that the jokes of the Ameri

exception to Dr. Temple's platform
methods. *
One of these was flev. Archie Macrae

ple was to speak. Rev Mr. Macrae sent
him a marked copy of an article in a
Presbyterian paper entitled, "The Crime
of the Clerical Fool." It dealt with min
isters lowering the dignity of their sub
jects by silly stories and funny remarks.
Dr. Temple opened the paper after he
reached the platform and there was' an
abrupt pause as he began his second ad
dress. He dednred that the net was both
rude and Insulting and he delivered a
tongue-lashing to tha, Scotch minister so
severe that none who "heard it will forget
It in a long time. He denounced the man
who had sent it as a coward and a black

that the sender of the marked copy was

The report that Prince Tuan has been
appointed to a pest where his Influence for
evil is even greater than it formerly was
is here regarded by Government and press
as unmistakable evidence that the Chi

The argument, besides, is that Germany's
demand that China give up the ringlead
ers before peace negotiations are begun
must be complied with by China in order
to show that she is really acting in good
faith.
The Cologne Gazette, which since the

Forty.Three of the Fifty-Eight

Conservatives.
The Liberals had evidently packed the
audience and the disturbance was so great
that his lordship was finally obliged to
<!esi?t from addressing the meeting and
â¢ â¢ommunicated the balance of his remarks
to the reporters, -who congregated on the
platform.
Lord Georpe Hamilton. Secretary of
StatÂ«> for lnÂ«lia. who has represented the
ICallnjr division of Middlesex in the House
â¢Â«f Commons, and who is a brother of the
Duke of Abercurn. had a very hostile re
ception at a Unionist meeting in London
this afternoon.
In all sixty-six candidates were re
turned. The Ministerialists aggregate 53,
Lib*Ta.ls live and Nationalists two. Vis

rlittie William Court Gully. Speaker of the
M<^u?e of Commons (Carlisle), and Sir
Henry Hartley Fowler, formerly Secre
tary of Statefor the Home Department
and Secretary of State for India (Kast
Wolverhampton).
An interesting feature of the elections
is the intervention in the colonies for the
firFt time in the election of the Mother
land. A dispatch from Hobart, Tasmania,
announces the adoption of a resolution by
the TaFmanian Assembly proposing a
i<Mnt Australian cablegram congratulat
ing Mr. Chamberlain on the British suc
fp*=srs in South Africa and hoping the
rlectors of Great Britain will emphati
cally insist on the fruits of victory being

Among the interesting personages on the

LONDON. Sept. 29.â One hundred and
fclxty-stven constituencies, returning one
fourth of the membership of the House of
commons, made their nominations to-day.
Vp to 1 o'clock this afternoon fifty-eight
members had been elected, unopposed,
comprising forty-three Conservatives,
eight T'nioniEts, five Liberals and two Na
tionalists.
There -is frank acknowledgment in all
quarters of the sweeping American suc
cesses, and it is accompanied with com
plete generosity.
Kdward Corrlgan's action In causing
Sloan to appear before the jockey club In
an effort to have him carry out his con
tract to ride Mr. Corijgan's horse Sar
donic II In the Czarewitch Instead of a
mount which Sloan seemed to prefer has
called forth considerable comment, the
papers congratulating the turf on the ar
rival of an American owner who, as one
paper puts it, "will not let himself be
ridden over rough shod by Jockeys In the
v.'ay that so many English aristocrats and
patrician owners with lamblike meekness
nave hitherto done."
That 'Statement well voices the prevail
ing sentiment. Lester Rciff now heads
tho list of winning jockeys. The week has
witnessed the defeat of England's cham
pion, the Diamond Jubilee, by an Ameri
can hcrso Â¦which would, it is understood,
have been ridden by an American jockey
had It not been for Sloan's disagreement
with the Keenea while In New York. But
the fact that Cannon rode Disguise II de
tracted little from the â¢victory.
Sloan, /by the -way, is not likely to losÂ«
anything by ceasing to ride for the
Keenes, as it is said he has received $25,000
as a retainer to ride for the Prince of
Wales.
John Redmond, the leader of the United
Irish party, to which both Messrs. O'Brien
and Healy belong, has quite failed to re
store harmony. J. L. Carew, who has
represented the CoHege Green division of
Dublin, is not only opposed by a Con
servative, but a candidate put forward by
a number of his constituents who are op
posed to him because he attended the
Queen's garden party.
The Conservative party in Dublin la
also torn by internal dissensions over the
refusal of Horace Curzon Plunkett, who
represented the south division of Dublin
County, and who Is vice president of th*;
Department of I Agriculture and other
technical industries, a commissioner of
the Congested Districts Board of Ireland
and also a commissioner of the Coloniza
tion Board of Scotland and Ireland and
who founded tho Irish Agricultural So
ciety'to debar Home Rulers from posi
tions in the Department of Agriculture
and by the support which Gerald Balfour.
the Chief Secretary for Ireland, has given
his action. A curious feature of this dis
sension, which is the most bitter the Con
servatives in Ireland have had in years.
Is that the Guinness millionaires, Lord
Iveagh'and Lord Ardilaun, r.re taking op
posing .views and are sustaining them vig
orously with their wealth and influence.
"There is much reason to believe," says
this week's Field, "that never In the
whole history of British sport has any
thing occurred of such a revolutionary
nature and so shattering to the accepted
standards of belief as the triumphant de
scent t)n the British turf of fhe American
jockeys and trainers."
In Ireland the election Issues are in
teresting. A very verbal fight is in pro
gress between William O'Brien and Tim
othy M. Healy. Mr. O'Brien is backed
up by the United Irish League and John
Dillon and others, while Mr. Healy has
Timothy D. O'Sullivan and several other
prominent men arguing in his behalf. The
result is that a large number of the con
stituencies will bo contested by nominees
of both Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Healy who
apparently profess the same political
principles. This may give the Conserva
tives an opportunity to capture a few
seats. â¢
Thus attacked on all Bides, the central
figure of the campaign, Mr. Chamberlain,
would have excitement enough if the op
position to him were confined to the op
ponents of the Government. That thl3 is
not the case Is evident from the ill-con
cealed delight with which some of Mr.
Chamberlain's supporters hail the bitter
est attacks on the Colonial Secretary,
while the party leaders, though suppress
ing any personal dislike, are seriously dis
turbed over tho allegations connecting the
Chamberlains with the Kinochs and other
firms supplying the Government.
Meanwhile the attitude of the European
powers toward China remains in the same
chaotic state. The Conservative party
managers would, so far as Great Britain
is concerned, see this policy of delay, ex
tended over the next two weeks, so that
no more handles could be afforded the
Liberals in their attacks upon the Gov
ernment. The chief object of theseâ Mr.
Chamberlain â seems to be losing his tem
per. In reply to a public statement by
Hon. Philip Stanhope, Liberal president
of the National Reform Union, regurd
ing the Hawkesly documents, Mr. Cham
berlain telegraphed to the latter telling
him he would "not be - blackmailed by
Stanhope or any one else," and adding:
"There is no correspondence and never
has been to prove my complicity in the
raid, which I did my utmost to stop."
Mr. Stanhope replied: "I will not stop to
qualify the vulgarity of your language,
but 4 em prepared to substantiate In the
courts every statement I have made con
cerning (j,OU." .
Mr. CSimberlaln, however, Is not ex
pected to take the matter into the courts.
But he hits back hard, with a personal
bitterness quite foreign to the traditions
of the usually sedate Cabinet Minister.
The latest feature of Mr. Chamberlain's
speeches consists in his holding up Dr.
Cavin Brown Clarke, Liberal, who repre
sented Calthness-shire and who was for
.merly Consul General of the South Af
rican Republic in London, and Henry
l^bouchere, the editor of Truth, to ig
nominy as traitors, till the audience
shouted (referring to Clarke) "Shoot him."
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, the Liberal
statesman, who has come out of retire
ment and has astonished the country by
the virility of his speeches (he was born
in 1827), scored a point by dubbing Mr.
Chamberlain a "little African" on the
ground that, as he claimed, Mr. Chamber
lain would sacrifice everything for his
African policy, and added: "Mr. Chamber
lain, considering himself to be a Captain
Cook and a General Wolfe, rolled into one,
believes he discovered Australia ana
stormed Quebec."
LONDON, Sept. 29.-Judglng from ap
pearances the British press is preparing
the wav for the announcement that Lord
Salisbury has failed to agTee to the pro
posals contained in the German note. The
papers which at first angrily declared
that the statement made to the Asso
ciated Press was inaccurate are now
either silent or are taking the view that,
after all, it is doubtful if it would be ad
visable for Great Britain to become a
party to such a stringent meas
ure. As a matter of fact, the
statement regarding Lord Salisbury's
determination created so much ex
citement and brought such severe com
ment from Berlin that it may resujt in
Great Britain's formal reply not being de
livered and may induce Germany to a
compromise arrangement. The long de
lay in Great Britain's reply reaching Ber
lin Increased the likelihood of this hap
pening. It is pointed out that it would cer
tainly suit Lord Salisbury, as he has no
inclination to incur German animosity if
it can be avoided.

THEORIES ABOUT FOOD.
Also a Few Facts on the Same
Subject.
We hear much nowadays about health
foo4Â« and hygienic living, about .vegeta-
rianism and many other fads along- the
same line.
Rpptaurants may be found In the larger
<~itiÂ«Â»F where no meat, pastry or coffee Is j
served and the food crank is in his glory, j
and arguments and theories galore ad-|
vanced to prove that meat was never In- j
tended for human stomachs, and almost I
make us believe that our sturdy ancestors
vho lived four-score years In robust
health en roast beef, pork and mutton
must have been grossly ignorant of the
laws of health. i
Our forefather? had other, things to do
than formulate theories about the food
they ate. A warm welcome was extended
to any kind, from bacon to acorns.
â¢ A healthy appetite and common sense
are excellent guides to follow In matters
of dirt, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and r/K-ats is undoubtedly the best.
As compared with grains and vegetables
mrat furnishes the most nutriment In a
highly concentrated form and Is digested
and 1? assimilated more quickly than veg-
etables and grains.

SAN MATEO, Sept. 29. â In order to preserve the grounds from injury
and Intrusion on the part of the general public during the barn dance on
Friday night, Frank Carolan enlisted the services of the township Constable
and City Marshal of San Mateo, and these officers In turn collected from the
ranks of the countryside a squad of thirty special officers. After the men
had been selected an order was passed around, purporting to be from Mr.
Carolan, but which afterward proved to be entirely without the knowl
edge of that gentleman, that ten of the men were to be 'mounted on steeds
to be supplied from his stables. This was necessary, it was said, because
of the large area to be patrolled during the night. The men were ordered
to meet in the plaza of the town of San Mateo early Friday evening, where
the. horses would be awaiting them.
Some one obtained ten of the wildest bronchos which are being trained for
the German army at Baden, and as each animal was blindfolded, the gTeen
riders had no difficulty In mounting. But there was a man at each broncho's
head, and at a given signal the blinds were lifted. ; Z?$eM
To make a long story short, thera were ten disabled special officers, the
town was thrown Into a ferment of excitement, and riderless Baden bronchos
arÂ© overrunning the country hereabouts. ThÂ« Constable and Marshal and
tha entire force of special policemen are now looking for the man who nego
tiated the bronchos from Baden. â¢

LOS ANGELES. Sept. 29.-A million
dollar suit was filed In the Superior Court
this morningâ at least, that is the amount
oi money set forth in the complaint. The
title of the case is "the Los Alamitos
Sugar Company against Jonathan Bixby
and Thomas Flint," and It is an action
to compel the defendants to procure a
right of way for/the drainage from the
Alamitos sugar factory, as per alleged
agreement, over the lands now owned by
Mrs. J. W. Bixby, Fred H. and Susan
Bixby. to the Pacific Ocean, or, in case
of failure to do so, to pay $1,000,000 dam
ages.
In June. 1S96, W. A. and J. Ross Clark
entered into an agreement with the late
Llewelyn Bixby, owner of the Alamitos
rancho, situated in the southern part of
Los Angeles and the northern part of
Orange counties, one of the conditions
which was that there should be a right
of way over the lands lying between tlie
factory and the ocean, a distance of about
fouf miles, for the drainage of the tract.
The Messrs. Clark transferred their
agreement to the Alamitos Sugar Com
pany and the factory was built and has
been in operation for the past three sea
sons.
In the meantime Llewelyn Btxby died
and the right of way has not been pro
cured. On the contrary, suit has been
brought against the sugar company for
heavy damages, alleged to have been
caused by the ditch over the land in
question. As It Is practically Impossible
to conduct the factory without means
of disposing of the drainage, suit was in
stituted to compel the fulfillment of the
contract or the payment of the value of
the Improvements made by the company.

GRASS VALLEY, Sept. 29.â Joseph
Weaver of Gold Flat and Miriam Ange
lita Gilmore of Nevada City have been
joined in the holy bonds of wedlock and
their marriage has afforded a topic for
discussion in half the homes of Grass
Valley. Weaver Is 67 years of age and
his bride is a child of 14. The ceremony
was performed In Judge Green's court
and the witnesses were a score or more
of the boon companions of the aged
groom and his father-in-law.
Judge Green hesitated to marry the
two,, but as the father of the bride was
there and gave his consent, and the wed
ding was legal, he reluctantly tied the
knot. The same time he gave some
good advice to the aged groom, suggest
ing he take good care of the child.
John Gilmore, father of the girl, was
present at the ceremony. He said he
urged the marriage, because the girl had
left home and gone to live with Weaver.
The father is a worthless character and is
familiarly known as "Hell Fire Jack."
Weaver is possessed of no means and
could not pay the customary fees. Weaver
took the girl to a saloon and bought her
a glass of beer after the ceremony and
the father of Miriam expressed his re
grets that he did not hava enough to
"treat" the crowd, as he thankful
to be rid of the care of the child. They
soon left town for Weaver's cabin on
Gold Flat, where the honeymoon will bo
spent. The young wife is one of a fam
ily of ten children, two of whom are In
the Reform School.

Stole San Jose Wheels and Shipped
SAX JOSE, Sept. 29.â A wholesale steal-
Ing of bicycles was unearthed by the po
lice to-day, and Louis M. Kaskens, a
former pool seller in this city, is in jail
and has confessed to 1-aving stolen seven
wheels. Many bicycles have been stolen
here, and no trace of them could be
found. It was suspected they were being
shipped out of the State, but the police
could get no clew upon which to work.
' A few days ago Officer Prindiville
learned that Kaskens had been taking
many wheels apart and shipping the
pieces to Chicago. An investigation
showed that Kaskens on September 17
shipped two large dry goods boxes con
taining parts of bicycles to Chicago ad
dressed to Louis M. Kaskens, 264 Sedg
wick street. The goods had been marked
'â¢carpenter tools."
To-day Kaskens was arrested and taken
to the police station. In the "sweat box"
he broke down and confessed. He had in
tended to follow the wheels in a day or
two and dispose of his bootâ and had
been prevented from going shortly after
shipping the wheels because of an error
In a remittance check sent by his rel
atives. Chicago police have been com

FRESNO, Sept. 29.â Colonel Har
rington Astley Trevelyan, manager
of the Barton vineyard estate, died
at the Burnett Sanitarium this
morning of heart trouble, aggra
vated by an attack of pneumonia. Colonel
Trevelyan was a survivor of the famous
Light Brigade and participated in the
memorable charge at Balalclava during
the Crimean war. He served as cornet in
the Eleventh Hussars, one of the "four
regiments that composed the brigade, un
dar Lord Cardigan. He was the descend
ant of a well-to-do English family.
Colonel Trevelyan's illness was contracted
in San Francisco during the recent cele
bration. He recovered from the attack of
pneumonia, but the disease left him in a
weakened condition and he succumbed to
the heart trouble, from which he had suf
fered for years.
Colonel Trevelyan was 19 years old
when he took part in the famous battle
of Balaklava. He was then a lieutenant
in the Eleventh Hussars. When Lord
Raglan, eommander-in-chief of the Brit
ish army, gave the order to the Six Hun
dred to charge and endeavor to retake
the guns that had been captured by the
Russians, there were 20,000 of the enemy
posted at the end of the narrow valley,
with mountains back of them and bat
teries of guns in their front. But the
Six Hundred, since immortalized by Ten
nyson's thrilling lyric, boldly rode "Into
the Jaws of death, into the mouth of
hell," the Lancers shaking their weapons
in the air. the young Earl of Cadogan at
the front as cool and Intrepid as if going
to a hunt with the hounds.
Colonel Trevelyan, whenever he spoke
of the "charge of the Six Hundred," mod
estly referred very little to himself.
In his opinion had the Seventeenth Lan
cers and the Eleventh Hussars been or
dered to advance when a disorganized
force of Russian cavalry crossed the
plain to reach the shelter of their forts,
the Russians would have been routed and
the disaster that befell the British arms
would have been averted.
"At the opportune moment," so related
Colonel Trevelyan a few years ago, "the
officer in command of the Seventeenth
Lancers, said to ihe young Earl of Cado
gan, 'There, my Lord, Is an opportunity
never likely to return.'
When Captain Nolan came from Lord
Raglan with the order to charge there
were no Russians in sight. But oft we
went around the end of the valley and
charged half a league straight through
the batteries of guns in front, with guna
on both flanks and riflemen lining the
hills. Captain Nolan, who brought the
order to charge, had not gone far when
he gave a fearful yell and dropped dead.
The grapeshot was tearing holes in us.
One of our seniors was literally blown
up, and we found no trace of him after
ward."
This is the substance of Colonel Trev
elyan's version. When the survivors rode
back Colonel Trevelyan was congratulat
ing himself upon not being dead, when a
bullet struck his headdress. That night
he went to the hospital with a bullet
wound in the calf of his left leg, a sword
cut on his right wrist and several minor
cuts and wounds to attest to the fierce
ness of the fray.
After the Crimean war Colonel Trevel
yan returned to England and was feted
as a hero. His promotion was rapid He
served In India, and at the age of 33 he
was a colonel In her Majesty's service.
In 1S90 he came to the United States.
\\hile touring In California he saw and
liked the country near Fresno, and he has
since remained there as manager of the
Barton vineyard.
Colonel Trevelyan's father was an Eng
lish clergyman and the son of a baronet
Sir George Otto Trevelyan was a cousin.
Sir Walter Trevelyan, the present baro
net, is a nephew of Colonel Trevelyan.
Colonel Trevelyan was well known In
w, n F^anc'sco. where he spent consider
able of his time. He was a popular mem
ber of the Press Club of this city.

other cities of the southern part of the
State. The visiting delegations arrived on
the evening train, having several special
cars attached to the Los Angeles local.
The members of the San Diego society
met them at the depot and formed a
torchlight parade, escorting the guests
through the decorated streets to the Tur
ner Hall, which was a mass of flowers
and bunting.
The opening session of the celebration
was held at the hall to-night. The ad

alyzed the contents of the stomach of
Mrs. Jennie Douglas Gotthold, who was
found dead In the house of her father.
City Trustee Phil Douglas, last Saturday
morning, has submitted his report to
Coroner McMullen. The chemist found
morphine in both the stomach and liver
to the combined quantity of five-sixths of
a grain. That would not ordinarily cause
death, but would prove fatal In the case
of a person addicted to the use of intoxi
cating liquors. The Coroner will resume
the Inquest in Mrs. Gotthold's case next
week.
The case of May Arlington, charged
with vagrancy, who was arrested at the
Instance of Policeman James Douglas, an
uncle of the deceased, will come up for
trial on October 4. The Arlington woman
was a frequent visitor at the house of
Trustee Douglas, and Policeman Jame.i
Douglas openly charged that she was en
deavoring to obtain a hold of his brother's
property. Her arrest, following Imme
diately the death of Mrs. Gotthold. added
to the mystery surrounding the case, and
has led to the belief that the uncle of the
dead woman may be holding in reserve
some sensational evidence against the
prisoner.

STOCKTON, Sept. 29.â Carlton H.
Stowe, an Inmate of the State Hospital
for the Insane, made a vicious attack late
last night upon Peter Martin, the attend
ant In charge of his ward. Martin's scalp
was gashed to the bone in a half dozen
places and his right eyebrow and right
ear were bitten off by his insane assail
ant.
Stowe planned the assault with the
shrewd cunning frequently exhibited by
madmen. He knew that Martin entered
the dormitory late each evening to re
strain in bed one of the patients. Stowe
obtained a piece of bed ticking and when
out exercising lnvthe yard he gathered a
pocketful of sand and gravel. With these
he succeeded in making a rude but effec
tive sandbag.
Armed with this murderous weapon, the
insane man laid in wait for the attendant,
whom he had planned to kill because the
latter would not allow him as many liber
ties as he thought he was entitled to.
"While Martin was working with the
straps on the bed, the patient dealt him a
vicious blow behind the ear with the
sandbag. Martin dropped to ".he floor, and
then his Insane assailant rained blow aft
er blow upon the head of the prostrate
man. Growing more furious, the mad
man sprang upon the unconscious attend
ant and bit him fiercely about the face
and neck. The taste of human blood ap
parently affected the madman as It would
a wild beast, and the ferocity he display
ed, as described by another patient who
witnessed the attack, was diabolical.
The flowing blood brought Martin to a
feeble consciousness, and after one of the
other patients had pulled Stowe from his
victim, the attendant was able to call for
help. Other attendants quickly arrived
end Martin was assisted from the room.
The attendants went back to look after
Stowe and found him in bed feigning
sleep. He made no resistance when the
straps were placed on him. This morn
ing he asked if he had killed Martin, and
when told that the attendant would live
he muttered his regrets.
Stowe is suffering from what the physi
cians term paranoia. -He imagines that
he is being persecuted and pursued. He
was committed from El Dorado County
in 1S05 and is an incurable. He believed
that Martin had the power to release him
from the institution if he would, and it
was because the attendant refused to help
him to escape from the asylum that he
made the attack on him.
The injured man was removed to his
home and is doing- well, but will be disfig
ured for life.

AN ATTENDANT
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VAULEJO, Sept. 29.â As the result of a

o'clock this morning, the proprietor,

meant business and : started to rush
through the back door. Barker shot at
his fleeing tormenters, the bullet taking
effect jn the right elbow of James Coak
ley. shattering the wnes of his arm.
Barker walked out into the street and
was followed by Burns, who asked him
what was the matter. At this Barker
turned half around and fired directly at
Burns. The saloon man dodged, but too
late. The bullet passed directly through
his neck, just missing the jugular vein.
Barker started up the street at a lively
pace and entered a yard at the rear of the
Klondike saloon, where he reloaded hfs
revolver and a>;ain came upon the street.
He was captured by Officers Williams ar.d
Scully. He made no resistance and was
taken to jail, where he will remain pend
ing- the results of the wounds he inflicted
upon his victims. He was still greatly ex
cited when taken in. ana paid that he had
been tormented into the act. He will be

WASHINGTON. Sept. 29.â Baron Speck
von Sternberg, German Charge d' Affaires,
was at the State Department to-day in
reference to- closing up that branch of the
Satnoan agreement relating to the pay
ment to the native Samoans the value of
the rifles surrendered by thorn. When the
Samoan Commissioners arrived at Apia
they deemed it expedient first to secure
the disarmament of the belligerent native
factions. This was agreed to by the na
tives on the understanding that $12 50 for
each rille would be paid. Some 3000 rifles
thereupon were turned over.
The natives now are asking- the payment
of the money, and Dr. Solf. the Governor,
has proposed that the payment shall be
made under restrictions proposed by the
foreign Consuls in order that the consid
erable amount of money Involved shall not
load to disorder among the natives. The

Through the efforts of Miss Mabel
O'Connor, who resides at 3443 Nineteenth
street, the fund for the relief of the Gal
veston sufferers was Increased to the ex
tent of $70 25. This sum was turned
over to The Call yesterday by the young
lady, and was immediately sent to the
Red Cross Society to be entered with the
other sums received by that organization.
When the news of the terrible hurricane
which played havoc with the lives and
property of the residents of Texas
reached this city Miss O'Connor thought
she would like to do something that
would aid the sufferers. She Is a talented
schoolgirl, and. after consulting her par
ents, decided to give an entertainment to
aid the afflicted people. Friends â¢ gladly
volunteered to help her in her good work,
and a splendid programme was arranged.
On September 'JO the entertainment was
given in Native Sons' Hall,* and was a
brilliant success.
Yerba Huena Chapter. V. D.. Order of

NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â The system of
relief distribution now in operation In
Galveston is described in the following
telegram from Clara Barton, president of
the American National Red Cross, re
ceived to-day at the rooms of the Red
Cross Texas relief fund in this city:
"Upon the repeated solicitation of the
local authorities the Galveston local re
lief committee, composed entirely of men,
and the local Red Cross emergency com
mittee, composed entirely of women, were
merged into- one committee yesterday and
immediately ordered into the Galveston.
auxiliary of the American National Red
Cross. The entire work of distribution of
clothing and other supplies was trans
ferred to the new organization, all such
work to be' immediately and henceforth
conducted under the auspices and by the
direction of the American Red Cross.
"Not the slightest interruption of the
work will take place. The ten ward dis
tributing stations established and being
used by Chairman McVittie's committee
will be continued as found necessary with
the accession of the Red Cross ladies,
one of whom has been appointed vice
chairman of each ward, with three or
more assistants to aid In the sorting and
delivery of goods at the relief stations,
with additional accessations of ladles for
each ward station to any number that
may be found necessary, who shall make
systematic examination in certain streets
assigned to them of the worthiness of all
applicants for relief. \
"The work being thus systematized can
be most thorouRhiy conducted indefinitely.
The relief by this painstaking and sys
tematic method will have to be continued
many months.
"The relief work is most completely or
ganized and l educed to a perfect system.
"The most Imperative subject now be
fore the committee and the occasion of
great Importance next to sanitary relief
in cleaning the city is the question of pro
viding suitable homes of a tempora.ry na
ture for more than SOW homeless persons.
"The committee is forming a plan now
for the purpose of meeting that necessity.
Immense quantities of lumber, nails, roof
ing and carpenters' tools and a large fund
of. money will be necessary to suitably
meet this end. In every Instance where
possible the sufferers will be expected to
furnish their own labor in the reconstruc
tion of their homes, thereby keeping
everj- one employed."

R. J. Crlmont, superintendent of the
Holy Cross Mission at Koserfsky, on the
Yukon River, in a letter to the Secretary
of the Treasury, says the plague has
ravaged a great part of the coast of Si
beria and Alaska, reaching the mission
about the middle of July. Nearly all tne
natives were seized about the same time,
making it difficult to care for the sick, as
those having mild cases had to care for
those more severely attacked. A severe
famine ensued, as the natives could not
fish or work and panic was added to the
distress caused by the disease. Over 23
per cent of the natives died.
Mr. Crlmont says too much praise can
not be bestowed upon the representatives*
of the Treasury Department, Colonel
Evans and Lieutenant Jarvls, and Cap
tain Cantwell of the revenue cutter Xunl
vak, without whose assistance misery and
death would have been much greater.
They established relief stations and dis
tributed food to the natives. Captain
Cantwell not only gave all the relief sup
plies on board his vessel, but divided his
ship's stores with the needy, giving all
that was not absolutely required for his
crew.
Mr. Crlmont says the Treasury officials
were criticized by some Americans for the
manner In which they distributed the sup
plies, but he says the criticism is ground
less, as the means taken were proper to
prevent relief falling Into hands of per
sons who did not need it.

Many natives of Alaska have died during

an alarming extent, and which has been

What a Trial Package of a Remedy
Did for Her.
The portraits of Mlos Emma Emond show
what a striking difference is made In a person
when the bald head ls covered with hair. Miss
Emond was totally bald; the hair follicles not
only upon her head but upon her eyebrows be-
ing completely contracted, not the sign of a
hair being found. Of course she was the object
of many experiments, all of which failed, and
the offer of a well known Dispensary to send a
free trial of their remedy was peculiarly allur-
ing to her. She sent for the free trial, followed
all directions faithfully and soon she was re-
warded by a growth of hair which for. 'thick-
ness, quality and luxuriance was as remark-
able as the result was gratifying. Miss Emond
lives In Salem. Mass.. at 276 Washington St..
and naturally feels very much elated to recover
from total baldness. An Itching scalp to peo-
ple who are blessed, with hair Is a sign of com-
ing baldness and should'be attended to at once.'

moved all dandruff and stopped the Itching."

Ceneral Miles, commanding . the United
Ft*.TÂ«*8 armr. in his annual report will re
new niÂ» recommendation for the further
tue oi the automobile in the army.
I^-tson Baljlct of this cJty, who Is car
rying on m'.ning operations in Eastern
Oregon, returned yesterday from Baker
City afoer a two weeks 1 tour of Inspec
tion of his interests In the camps and dis
tricts tributary to the metropolis of Eaat
cnÂ» Oregon. Mr. Balllet has recently se
cured control of the Gold Ridge mine in
the Lower Burnt River district and the
White Swan mine on the Virtue lode, and
tays he has in contemplation Beveral big
enterprises allied to mining at the new
copper caaip of Burkemont, In the old
Coppor Butte mining district. The Baker
City country has been undergoing a re
vival In the past two years. Eastern
capital Is oomlng in and there is an influx
Â°* Colorado. Utah and Montana, miners
and prospectors.
"The Gold Hi<5ge mine." Eald Mr. Bal
liet. "in its day has produced somewhere
between J200.000 and $300,000 in gold. A.
Jew years ago the then operators allowed
the lower workings of the mine to be
come flooded. When the mine passed into
my hands I proceeded to unwater the
fha.ft, and Just before I came away Su
perintendent Nichols reported that the
lower drift in the shaft at a depth of 250
teet was nearly acctssible. and it !s
probable that within a week we will
nave the station pumps going- They will
keep the mine drained.
"The level will then be extended out to
the veins and the known ore bodies and
permit us to work on the overhand
.-topes At present there are twenty men
at work on the. property, a part or them
being engaged in mining in the workings
above the shaft, where a new vein was
opened up within the past two months
Ore is being taken out. The lower grade
Is being run through the ten-stamp mill,
w e intend after a while to sink the shaft
to a still greater depth. It is a vertical
one. g-oing down In the hanging wall 300
feet west of vein No. 2. and levels will be
run out from the shaft at every' l'Â» feet
v he Â«â¢' eins dip low ard the shaft. We
have M acres of ground in our group
and when it is properly opened up ex
pect to work on an extensive scale. At
present we are fairly well equipped In
surface improvements, but a dynamo will
soon be installed for the electric lighting
of the mine and mill. tÂ»"""b
"In the Burnt River district, about six
miles east of tie Gold Ridgo mine, is the
oold Hill group, which is being extensive
ly developed by a eyndicate of Eastern
capitalists represented by Colonel Jamei
?A' Jlf n i e i They have "Penned Jl^.c-30
in drhing long- crosscut tunnels and adit
cruts and have opened up large bodies
of low grade gold bearing ore. They are
now Increasing their mill capacity for
amalgamation and will also put in a dyna
mo for .lighting and power, having water
lor the Initial power.
"Most of the attention of prospectors
and miners, however, is being given to the
country axour.d Sumpter. Granite and
l^awton, all three places having enjoye.l
something of a boom as a sequel to the
opening up of the Red Boy mine. Im
provements tre being prosecuted at an
expense of several hundred thousand dol
lars. Many obscure properties are com
ing to the front i.i the district tributary
to the three camps and now and then
a new strike is made. Sumpter has
settled down to a bustling substantial lit
tle city of r&uO Inhabitants and a new
note! is to be built at a cost of $60 WO
One of the leading eplrlta In the upbuild
ing of Sumpter is Charles S. Warren /or
many years a leading politician of Butte
Mont. Robert E. Strahorn of Chicago in
the early days an extensive operator In
Idaho, has also invested heavily in Sump
"But It is the copper belt of Eastern
Oregon that will soon be commanding at
tention. Â¦
"It is an extension to the southwest of
the Seven Devils copper district of Idaho.
A new camp has been started in this belt
at a point eighteen miles northeast of
liaker City. It is called Burkemont. the
iounder being Judge Thomas Burke of
Lfes Moincs, Iowa. He is president and
manager of the North American Mining
Company, which has undertaken the de
velopment of several hundred acres of
eround in the copper belt in Oregon. They
have put up a hoisting plant and are
sinking a double compartment snaft
which is now down 125 feet. From thÂ«>
X'-rth American Mining Company and
frum companies owning contiguous ter
ritory I and associates have secured con
cessions which will warrant the erection
of a emelter or reduction works at Burke
mont and we will also build a railroad
Irom Baker City to the Burkemont mines.
Surveys have already been made of the
line, smelter and depot sites, -and when
tlie right moment comes we will proceed
Â¦with the work of construction.
VBaker City enjoyed something of a
boom for about a year, but the month of
August and the first half of September
Â¦were very quiet In a business way. Since
the crops began to move and the miners
are coming down from the snowy camps
trade has commenced to pick up and
building operations are brisk."
While the mining Journals of the North
west are busily engaged In discussing the
proposition of another mining congress,
to be held next year at Boise city, Idaho,
there Is at least one mining- paper that
takes occasion to fling rocks at the entire
subject of International conventions of
miners. This is the American Mining
>.ews, which facetiously remarks that no
one Is helped toy getting together and
listening to "Why Women May Engage
in Mining,*' or "How to Mine Building
Blone In Wisconsin."
"Who cares." asks the Mining News.
"whether or not women engage in min
ing? Surely the mining man of the Rocky
Mountain region Is not bothering about
limestone deposits of Wisconsin." In lieu
of International conventions the Journal
named would have "Interstate conven
tions, where matters directly related to
the interest* of the various sections may
bo Intelligently discussed." It Bays:
"There can never be a general meeting
of mining men where such an array of
subjects can be treated upon that will
afford the mining man from Colorado and
his co-workers In Pennsylvania any bene
fit sufficient to warrant his spending
time and money going to a mining
congress. Their Interests are too diversi
fied and have about as much In common
as spinning of wool and raising cotton."
Thus the discussion la opened up and
ppecimens of ore, perhaps ''chunks of old
rod sandstone." such as Bret Harte talked
8 bout In his famous row among the Stan
islaus geologists, may fly before the
fracas Is over.
Th<? annual report of Harry A. Lee,
Commissioner of Mines for Colorado, has
been received, summarizing the precious
metal output of Colorado for the year
3 C 39. The total was $48.320,341 95, divided
br mineral values as follows: Oold, $26,
r^s.C5; silver, $13,771,731: lead, 56,170.765;
copper, tl 8C3.1C3. The production of Crlp-
T.le Creek amounted In value to $16,058,564
In rolfl and $43,033 Jn silver.
The new plant of the American Smelting
an<! Rr-flr.lDR Company, situated n*Â»ar Salt
Lek* City, which will cost $1,000,000, Is
adding a department for the treatment of
zinc ores. Thore i* muph speculation con
cerning the effect the establishment of
puch plant* will have upon the sine Indus
try- I^arivin* alone expects to recHve
$1,000,000 thl* yr-ar for zinc concentrates.
Utah has a nÂ»Â»w gold field. As usual it
Is predicted that it will turn out to be the
hiprÂ«st thin* in sight. That Is so cora
mcnly the forecast for new districts that
people generally a r<* contented to wait, a

grossly self-contradictory in it's official actions. Th*
Superintendent should remember; that the board has
made inconsistency the badge of its officer
The Board of Education admits that political in

It would be interesting to know what an Alameda
Coroner's jury would consider death by violence.
Several intellectual members of a recent jury wanted
to decide that a man who was killed by a bullet in the
back died from natural causes.
""Why, after he started Into the woods
he found out that his guide's life Is in
sured in the very company of which Biff
kins is president, and he didn't dare to
shoot at a thing after that for fear it
might be the guide."â Cleveland Plain
Dealer. â¢ .
"What was the trouble V
"BIffkins didn't enjoy his hunting trip
up In Maine a little bit."
SPOILED HIS SPORT.
The claims of the inventor have very naturally been
received with a good deal of skepticism. It has been
intimated that the exhibitions were more in the way
of a clever trick than a real invention. To meet these
objections Rosenberg arranged for a test by the news
papers of London. The Chronicle in describing the
test says: "The members of the press yesterday sub
mitted Mr. Rosenberg's system to a practical experi
ment. The transmitting instrument was placed in the
pressroom," and the journalists took the 'receiver 1 with
them to another room, forty yards or so away. The
door was closed, and four stout journalists stood right
in the track that the electric current on its brief jour
ney from transmitter to receiver would have to fol
low. So far as the lay mind could judge the experi
ment was a success. The current went right through
a glass door panel and the four journalists and set up
a cheerful tintinnabulation in the receiver. To say
nothing of the ponderous physical obstruction it met
with, the current had to go round two corners before
reaching the 'receiver.'" V
It will be noted that neitl/er the Telegraph nor the
Chronicle gives an unqualified report of the success
of the system; : The Telegraph contents itself with re
peating what Herr- Rosenberg claims, while the
Chronicle goes no further .than to say the experiment
made before the journalists appeared successful to
"the lay mind." Both of them, however, assert that
what, has been done by. the system constitutes a new
wonder in wireless telegraphy, and that the future of
the invention must be awaited with great interest by
the entire civilized world.
The chief navelty in the Rosenberg system is the
"receiver," an instrument so small that it can be car
ried in the hand. The receiver responds to the Hert
zian waves set in motion by the transmitter from any
point within a reasonable distance and records what
ever message has been sent out. Commencing upon
the new marvel the London Telegraph say&: "Mr.
Rosenberg's claim is that he has provided a practical
system which is clear of Marconi's patents, and which
can be much cheaper. With only the apparatus used
on Tuesday, and with no vertical, he maintains that
he can telegraph two miles; with poles he can send
messages forty miles, and is engaged on an automatic
repeating device which shall enable them to be sent on
indefinitely. But in the course of conversation he
mentioned an interesting fact. When he leaves his
office to lunch in a restaurant a couple of hundred
yards off he takes with him the little box containing
the receiving apparatus. This he sets on the table
beside him, and if the bell rings he knows that he is
wanted at the office, even though his clerks might not
be aware where he was, and he can receive a message
from them."
I"""^ RITISH newspapers are giving a good deal of
K\ attention to certain exhibitions of wireless
' â telegraphy at the Crystal Palace by what is
known as the "Rosenberg" system, and, according to
the reports, the feats accomplished far surpass any
yet attained by Marconi. The Rosenberg system does
not cover anything like the distance that has been
overcome by Marconi, but it has an immense advan
tage within short distances, inasmuch as it promises
to be of practical utility in all lines of business.

gently done and to repudiate a power which boasts
of its purpose to punish, then they should cast their
ballots for C. M. Belshaw. In their decision rests the
indorsement or the destruction of a principle of most
serious moment in public affairs.
"A few weeks ago the editor felt reasonably certain
cf one thing â that no possible consideration would
ever induce him to be again a candidate for office.
Some very strange things occur in this uncertain
v.orld, however, and with much hesitation, and prob
ably 2gainst my personal interests, I have yielded to
what seemed the general desire of my party and
accepted the nomination for Senator for the Eleventh
District"
That there may be not even the shadow of doubt
on the issue it should be known that James H. Wil
kins did not change his determination not to be a
candidate until Jere Burke, an accredited representa
tive of the Southern Pacific Company, whose office
adjoins that of H. E. Huntington, had seen Mr. Wil
kins and assured him of the support of the railroad.
Well-meaning voters cannot hesitate, therefore, as to
the line of their evident duty. Mr. Wilkins cannot
deny what this paper asserts.
If voters of the Eleventh Senatorial District wish
to uphold the evil power of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and help 'it to punish a public officer who has
performed his duty* in the face of railroad threats
promises and bribes, they should vote for James H.
Wilkins. If voters wish to vindicate and reward a
public man for service conscientiously and intelli-
M. Belshaw.
In his own newspaper Mr. Wilkins says of himself:
ON November 6 there will be decided in this
State at least one Senatorial contest in which
the principles at stake are defined with abso
lute clearness and in which the issues involved are
known beyond question by every voter who will take
part in the decision. No man who casts his ballot in
this contest can be in ignorance of the effect of what
he does, and his vote â¢will mean much for good or bad
government in California. The contest is between
C. M. Belshaw (Republican) and James H. Wilkins
i Democrat) for the State Senatorship from the
Eleventh District, which comprises the counties of
Contra Costa and Marin.
C. M. Belshaw is a public man upon whose charac
ter there is not a stain and against whose reputation
there is rot the suspicion of wrongdoing. As a mem
ber of the Legislature he has been honest, intelligent,
fearless in his assertion of what he believed to be
right, and uncompromising in his performance of
public duty. In every crisis of legislation he has been
foremost in the defense of the best interests of his
State and of the honor of his party.
For this he is to be punished by the only enemy
he ever made in public life â the- Southern Pacific
Company. Because' he refused to prostitute the
power which his constituents placed in his hands, be
cause he refused to submit himself to the base uses of
the railroad and assist in the election to the United
States Senate of a man who would have disgraced
California and dishonored the Republican party, Mr.
Belshaw has won the hatred of the Southern Pacific
Company and arrayed it against himself in this con
test. This is the issue of which every intelligent voter
in the Eleventh Senatorial District cannot be ig
norant.
The opponent of Mr. Belshaw is James H. Wilkins.
a man whose record in public life has been so far
above reproach as to cause his friends â and he has
many â the deepest regret and chagrin that he should
now lend himself to the designs of a corporation
whose name is a synonym for all that is evil in gov
ernment and dishonorable in public men. When the
Southern Pacific Company found that its bitter effort
to defeat Belshaw out of the nomination had failed
railroad agents were instructed to go into the Demo
cratic party and nominate a man whose standing,
pood name and popularity would offer obstacles to the
election of Belshaw.
To the dismay of his friends, who regret that he
should hazard a reputation well won for a temporary
honor, James H. Wilkins has accepted the Southern
Pacific nomination and has become the instrument
with which the railroad hopes to punish an honor
able public officer. In his editorial acceptance of the
nomination James H. Wilkins admits that there are
in circulation obscure hints that he has contracted
cbligations which may influence his legislative acts.
What he is pleased to term obscure hints are no
longer such. The Call states as a fact to-day that
James H. Wilkins is the nominee of the Southern
Pacific Company for Senator from the Eleventh Dis
trict and that the railroad has made him such simply
tc use him as an instrument with which to punish C.

more artistically. Paolo and Francesca ro

told over again In terms that appeal

py Is the age that can find the poet fit for

Is Stephen Phillips, who. after Leigh
Hunt and Boker had failed, has told for
us English speaking peoples, in moving
verse, the love story of the thirteenth
century Immortalized by Danteâ the, story
of Paolo and Franceses.
That Mr. Phillips' version should have
taken the form of a play and that this
play should have found thousands of
readers is an encouraging sign, moreover,
to those who have not quite given up hope
of seeing restored to the. English drama
that literary quality which the French
and the German drama have never lost.
Mr. Phillips' tragedy Is soon to be pro
duced in London. The sale of the book
version leads one to hope! extravagantly
perhaps, that as much ai*one per cent of
the population of that great city will care
enough about dramatic poetry to go and
see the play. Should this hope be realized
the play will run for eight weeks; that
means profit enough to induce the syndi
cate to bring it out in New York, and In
the fullness (or leanness)' of time in San
Francisco. That's a roundabout and pro
vincial way for us to get a good thing,
but it's the only way open to us until we
secure a first-class stock company under
a manager as Intelligent as Henry Miller.
Then, a play brought out in London, New

In Boker's clumsy version of the Paolo
and Francesca story Francesca is a pert,
forward coquette, an experienced woman
of the world, who wooes the unlucky
Paolo with a freedom that might well
arouse Lanciotto's worst suspicions.
There is not a touch of this vulgarity in
Mr. Phillips' characterization of the he
roine. Her opening speech shows her to
us as a maiden whose meditation has in
deed been fancy-free.

My lord, my father gave me to you: I
Am innocent as yet of this great life;

of Juliet.
After the betrothal in the gloomy hall
of the Malatesta Castle at Rimini, Gio

leaves them. Then comes this exquisite
scene:

O, Paolo,
Who are they that have lived within

It is not sigh, nor sound;
Only It seemeth difficult -to breathe;

FRANCESCA. .
What is It to be sad?
Nothing hath grieved me yet but ancient
, woes.
Sea perils, or some long-ago farewell.
Or the last sunset cry of wounded kings.
I have wept but on the pages of a book
And I hare longed for sorrow of my own.
PAOLO.
ComÂ© nothing nearer than such far-off
tears
Or peril from the pages of a book!
And therefore, sister, am I glad that you
Are wedded unto one so full of shelter.
Constant is he and steel-true till the
grave.
For me â to-night I must be gone.

To-night?
Ah, Paolo, go not away so Boon!
You brought me hitherâ leave me not at

Therefore the success of the Tillman party will not
raise the Southern wage scale, but it will destroy the
Northern. Senator Tillman would better go home
and read Lincoln on consent of the governed to the
disfranchised blacks of South Carolina.
Now, we do not pretend to say that parties and poli
tics can much assist labor in its upward path, but we
do say that parties and politics can greatly retard it.
That the labor system of the South effectually stops
the mouth of Tillman as a critic of Northern employ
ers is patent and plain to every man, and that Bryan's
policies carried into government will throw the coun
try into the convulsions of a panic, cessation of indus
try, stoppage of wages and a ruinous liquidation is be
yond denial.
To free labor a full dinner-pail does not mean only
what it meant to the slave. It is his sign of plenty,
of full supply of his physical wants, of a surplus for
clothing and shelter and a further surplus which ac
cumulates as capital and speeds him on to indepen
dence. It precedes all opportunity for his intellectual
advancement, which is impossible when his physical
wants are insufficiently supplied.
The statement of the case is its argument. It illu
minates the sodden hypocrisy of Tillman and his man
Bryan in their appeals to the wage-workers of the
North.
Since the slaves became free from ownership as
chattels the fight of Senator Tillman has been to keep
them in all other respects on terms of exact equality
with the Southern horse and ox and ass, and as to
their earnings to keep them down as near as possible
to the cost of the subsistence furnished to them when
they were chattels. These are the undenied and unde
niable facts in the Southern labor situation. We state
them without feeling and without prejudice. They are
facts which will soon impress the wage question in the
North. The Southern agricultural staples, cotton,
rice, tobacco and sugar, do not compete with the
Northen staples of wheat, corn, cattle, hogs and sheep.
Therefore differences in the labor cost of production
are not felt. But as the South advances in her manu
facturing, metal and coal industries the difference in
the cost of production is felt more and more plainly
every year. Senator Tillman's labor system will finally
bear heavily upon the Northern wage-worker, for his
wages enter into the cost of production which affects
the price of the product in the final marke*t and means
the crowding of the Northern producer to the wall.
This country has not yet seen the supreme battle of
the labor unions. It will be fought upon the same
field as the Civil War, and practically on the same is
sue, of the status and condition of labor. When cheap
labor production in the South reaches to reduce wages
in the North the labor unions will find their first move
to be an effort to raise Southern wages to the North
ern level, or, what is the same thing, to prevent the
lowering of Northern wages to the Southern level.
Their only recourse will be the unionizing of black
labor in the South. When that time comes Senator
Tillman will be seen en the firing line again, with his
trusty gun, resisting the wage equality of labor de
prived of consent of the governed with labor that is
free and consents at the ballot-box to the government
it creates.
In his speech at Milwaukee he scouted the testi
mony of the full dinner-pail, saying, "The slaves had
full dinner-pails." Yes, and so did the Southern
planter's horses and cattle have full bellies, and for
exactly the same reason. They were his chattels. He
drove the men he owned to labor just as he drove his
horse and his ox and his ass. And men, horses, oxen
and asses had exactly the same rights. They were on
terms of perfect equality, in being owned, fed and
worked. The owner's interest in them, which led him
to provide for their physical wants, was exactly equal.
The Northern laborer is free. He is organized in
beneficial and protective unions; he votes; he enjoys
government by consent. -Senator Tillman comes to
ask him to vote to put in power the Tillman party,
which in its section of the country prohibits labor
from voting, shot it down when it tried, and reduces
it to involuntary servitude through the use of the
criminal courts.
ing wages to millions of free laborers.
From a labor system with such antecedents and such
current features Senator Tillman comes North to
blackguard the men who have revived the industries
of the country, promoted production, found markets
abroad, furnished employment for labor and are pay-
Yancey boasted as late as i860 that among his thou
sand slaves he could show recruits fresh from Africa,
whom he called "the noblest Romans of them all."
At that date slavery had long been outlawed and de
clared piracy by international law.
involuntary servitude. In this way so large a percent
age of labor is secured by force as to hold down the
general level of wages near to the corlvict line. This
system prevails in Alabama, Mississippi and several
other States. It is a remote imitation of the man
hunts on the slave coast of Africa, by which origin
ally the labor market of the South was supplied.
He has come North to take up the cudgels of de
bate in behalf of the Northern laboring man. Labor
in his section is unable to defend itself. It is paid the
lowest wages in the Union, and in several Southern
States is practiced a system of sale of criminals to
contractors, who work them in Southern coalmines,
and even in the cane fields. The negroes are arrested
on any kind of pretext, put through the criminal
courts with a farce called a trial and condemned to
Just why this man should be flaunted in the North
by the Bryanites is not clear. He recently boasted
that 95 per cent of the Southern people of the South
regret that the Union was not destroyed. The Demo
cratic press in Georgia and other States recently
fcund it necessary to lepudiate him as uttering South
ern sentiment and opinion, and in that, section, if he
appear on any public occasion, his appearance is
apologized for by the better class of Southern men.
SENATOR TILLMAN, who boasted in the Sen
ate that when black men in the South at
tempted to enjoy that "consent of the-" gov
erned" guaranteed to them by the constitution he
"shot them, stuffed ballot-boxes, made false counts
and used tissue ballots," has gone' on the Northern
stump in behalf of consent of the governed in the
â¢Philippines.
THE FULL DINNER PAIL.
It can hardly escape the notice of any intelligent
citizen of the First District that the service of Mr.
Coombs has been of a kindthat equips him in the best
possible manner for a Congressional career as a rep
resentative of the Pacific Coast at this particular time.
For some years to come the affairs of the Orient will
engage a large part of the attention of our Govern
ment, and both diplomacy and legislation will have
to be directed toward obtaining f*r the United States
commercial advantages in that part of the world. Mr.
Coombs understands the oriental question. He has
learned it by official connection with oriental diplo
macy. He knows, moreover, how to make that
knowledge effective in a parliamentary body. He is
therefore likely to be in Congress one of the most in
fluential members from the. Pacific Coast. The First
District will benefit itself and the whole State by elect
ing him, not for this term only, but for many terms to
come.
At the present time Mr. Coombs holds the office of
United States Attorney, and in that position has
proven his ability as a lawyer of the first rank. It will
be perceived that he has had in office large expe
rience as a legislator, a parliamentarian, a diplomat
and a lawyer. He has been tried in many ways and
has shown himself capable of every duty intrusted to
him. He comes before the people of his district with
a record of public service which may well serve
as guarantee to his constituents that at Washington
he will not long remain on probation as an unknown
new man, but will speedily take his place 'among the
leaders of the House.
In 1892 Mr. Coombs was appointed United States
Minister to Japan, and while there was one of the
ablest officials in the foreign service of the country.
By the exercise of tact and firmness he obtained from
the Japanese Government such action as compelled
the return of thousands of Japanese then in Hawaii,
and thus laid the foundation for the policy adopted by
Japan later on of restricting the emigration of Japan
ese laborers to the United States.
The public career of Mr. Coombs has been one of
marked and well merited success. He was twice
elected District Attorney of Napa County, and by- his
service in that office won the esteem of citizens of all
parties. Later on he served in the State Legislature
several terms and easily took rank among the fore
most members of the Assembly. Twice he was chosen
Speaker, and while in that office not only did he per
form its routine duties with eminent impartiality and
vigor, but introduced reforms in legislative methods
that greatly facilitated the progress of business and
rendered it more easy to defeat unwise or dishonest
measures.
Mr. Coombs as a new man in the House will be to
some extent handicapped in the work of his first term,
but he will not be inexperienced in legislative mat
ters and in parliamentary business. With all work of
that kind he is as fully familiar as any man who ever
went to Congress for the first time, and it will not be
as a novice that he enters upon the task of advancing
measures in the interests of his constituents, either in
committee-rooms or upon the floor of the House.
Tâ NEPUBLICANS of the First Congressional Dis-
Y-S trict should be well pleased at having a candi
date so well fitted to achieve distinction in the
House of Representatives as the Hon. Frank . L
Coombs. Indeed all voters of the district may regard
with satisfaction the prospect of the election of, Mr.
Coombs, since it will assure them a representative at
Washington who will not only be faithful to their in
tcrests, but who has sufficient ability to make his ser
vice effective.

THESE BURGLAES BOLD
ABE BIGHT UP TO DATE
Eastern Safe-Crackers Work With
Electric Drills and Use Their
Victim's Voltage.
No amateur -cracksmen were the bold
<Â«vokÂ« who entered the building occupied
by the Drooks-Foliis Electrical Company
at S3 Mis-s'.on street some time during
Friday night.
Early yesterday morning, when J.
O'Brien. on>> of the flrm'B employes, en
rrred the store he found the lock of the
front door picked, the cash drawer
robbed and the combination of the safe
i.roken. The burglars had been strictly
| rofe5S=lonal in their work. Some bogus
r-oney which had been left in the drawer
v as untouched, as were some checks.
Hut it was the safe that exhibited un
r-,i?takable tracÂ«*s of an experts work.
The burglars had by means of an electric
drill operated by a current obtained by
tapping a fuse In the basement, bored a
hole through the iron outer casing of the
safe door, but when their up-to-date ap
pliance encountered the steel lining the
current had apparently proved too weak,
and fearing to risk discovery the burglars
had evidently abandoned their attempt.
Their nerve, however, did not fail them,
for they had carefully coiled up the wire
they had used to transmit the current,
and it was found neatly deposited in its
proper place.
Friday was the firm's collection day,
but even" had the pafe been opened the
burglars would have been disappointed,
for the day's receipts had been deposited
in a bank. All they secured was $20 taken
from the cash drawer. *
The burglary was reported to the police
and Detectives Dlnan and Wren were de
tailed on the case. They are of the opin
ion that the burglars were Eastern
cracksmen, as the methods employed are
in vogue in the East, although a novelty
here.
INCREASE IN
THE TRADE WITH
PORTO RICO
Result of Four Months'
Operation of the New
Tariff Law.
The corresponding four months in 1S99
cover a period in which the island was
under the American flag but subject to
the customs laws of the United States
which relate to foreign countries. The
corresponding four months of 1898 were
the war period and do not therefore fur*
nlsh a fair basis for comparison.' The
corresponding four months of 1897 and 1SS6
present normal conditions in the com
merce between the island and the United
States when it was Spanish territory.
â¢It is therefore now practicable to con
trast the commerce between the United
States and Porto Rico during
four, .months' operation of the .new
law with a corresponding period
prior to the enactment of this law when
the island was under the American flag
and also with corresponding periods when
the Island was Spanish territory, and to
determine whether the enactment of the
new law was followed by an increase in
our commerce with tue island. It will ba
The act went Into effect May 1, 1890, so
that the figures for August, which have
Just been completed by the Treasury Bu
reau of Statistics, complete the record
of the fourth month of commerce between
the Island and the United States under
the new law and render practicable a
comparison of the four months' term with
corresponding periods In preceding years.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL,. WASHINGTON. Sept. 23.â
Four months' operations of the Porto
Rlcan tariff law show an increase of more
than 100 per cent In our exports to that
Island as compared Â¦with the correspond
ing months of 1S99, and more than 300 per
cent as compared with the corresponding
months of 1S37 or 1S96.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Julius Kruttschnitt. fourth vice presi
dent and general manager, is on his way
home from New York and will probably
reach here to-morrow. Before going to
the Eastern metropolis Mr. Kruttschnitt
spent several days at Galveston directing

branch line, which was swept away by the
great flood.
J. C. Stubbs. third vice president, will
arrive here either Monday night or Tues

some time in New York.
rive in the city to-morrow noon. From
the Paris Exposition he went t" New
York, where it is said he has been in
close touch with those who are to name
the new president. He left New York for
Chicago last Wednesday.
The Fire Commissioners met yesterday
and decided that pompier scaling ladders
be supplied to all engine companies for
life-saving purposes. A fire alarm box
was ordered to be placed at the Children's
Hospital. Hydrants were ordered to be
placed in the Sunset District from Ninth
avenue and K street to Nineteenth" avenue
and K street; also that more hydrant3 be
placed in the district. Joseph Brown was
appointed hoseman of engine 3.
Fire Department Affairs.
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe officials |
are much interested in the movement in I
the East to form a pool of thefreignt
equipment of the various railroad com
panies. The plan is to organize an asso
ciation to include all the big companies
and have designated supply stations in
various parts of the country where the
freightcars can be promptly located.
The stations in California would probably
be In this city, Sacramento a.d Los An
geles.
The reason for the formation of a car
pool is the constantly increasing demand
for cars. The Southern Pacific and the
Burlington and Alton roads, in particu
lar, report a larger freignt traffic this
year than ever before, and despite the
increased equipment of the two roads they
find that many more cars could be used.
If a pool were formed each company
would pay mileage on every car used.
It costs 5S00 to build a freight car. It is
the opinion of railroad officials mat there
are enough cars distributed over the var
ious lines to answer all needs, provided
they could be available for any one or
more companies when needed. There. are
invariably a great many cars idle, as for
instance in the East during the winter
time. These could be sent West and made
good use of, as there is always a rush or
irelght traffic here in the winter.
Several dispatches have recently ap
peared in Eastern papers to the effect
that the Santa Fe will make a bid for the
contract for carrying the mail between
Ogden and San fc'rancisco and that tne
Southern Pacific will not relinquish it
without a struggle. In fact the dispatches
stated that there might be a speed war
inaugurated to settle matters.
Officials of the danta Fe said yesterday
that the story probably originated from
the fact that since the Santa Fe com
pleted its road into this city ihe oppor
tunities for competing with the Southern
Pacific have been increased materially,
and because of this keen competition the
impression prevails in the East that even
the mall transportation -is to be gobbled
up by the Santa Fe. _\ -:>.=- i
"It is true our competition with the
Southern Pacific is more pronounced,"
said the official, "but as to oiddlng for the
mail, that would be folly. The Southern
Pacific has a direct line from Ogden into
San Francisco, covering about 800 miles,
while our route covers nearly 2000 miles.
E. O. McCormick, the Southern Pacific s
general passenger traffic manager, will
not return to San Francisco- until the
latter part of the week. He is now at
his former home in Cincinnati, from which
place he goes to Chicago on Monday to
attend an unfinished meeting of the ex
ecutives of the various Western roads.
At the meeting which Mr. McCormick
attended last week the question of form
ing a transcontinental association was
discussed, but no definite action was
reached. Mr. McCormick is one of the
promoters of this new association and he
will endeavor to bring about Its formation
at to-morrow's meeting.
The plans for revising the military
transportation rates will also be perfect
ed Before the completion of the Santa
Fe's direct connection with San Francisco
the Southern Pacific was in a position to
practically dictate in the matter of Its
percentage from Ogden and Los Angeles.
Now the Santa Fe feels that it is en
titled to the same percentage that its
competitor exacted. It is quite likely that
the two companies will be given equal
control and division of traffic this side of
Chicago and final steps to that end will
be taken to-morrow.
The passenger department of the South
ern Pacific has inaugurated an improve
ment in the style of its coupon tickets,
and the tickets are now being sent out to
the various agencies. They go into effect
October 1. The ticket is patented by two
young men in the auditor's office of the
Oregon Short Line.
-?-Instead of having coupons strung one
under the other, they will be placed side
by side and one form of ticket will be
mnde to read over any number of roads
leading from a certain gateway. This to
a great extent does away with the very
annoying system of records that agents
have been required to keep. It also re
duces enormously the number of forms
that are required by the ticket passengers
to the many destinations called for. Each
coupon is a complete record of itself,
showing -the starting point, destination
and roads over which the purchaser
travels.
This week will be marked by the home
coming of all the Southern Pacific's of
ficials who have been In the East.

State Commissioners Submit an In
teresting Beport on Their Con
dition to the Governor.
The annual report of the State Commis
sioners of Building and Loan. Societies
which was Hied with the Governor yes
terday, contains some interesting informa
tion as to the amount of business done
by these organizations. The report was
signed by Commissioners Frank H. Gould
and E. D. McCabe. Secretary J. H. Field
aided the Commissioners in preparing the
document.
The report shows that the number of
members in those societies in 1899 was 36 -
780, and in 1900, O 7,450; that during the
year 1899 there were 2524 mortgage loans
and this year 2C97; that the number of
stock loans for 1S9S was 1C57, while for 190*
there were 1750. There were 958 houses
built in 1S99, as against 993 this year. Up
to June 1 there were 157 association in
this State. Of this number 68 were in San
Francisco, 21 In Los Angeles and 14 in Ala
meda. There have been -no failures dur
ing the past year, and all the associations
are reported to be in a prosperous condi
tion.
The total assets for 1D00 are $18,93o,SS3 70
The total disbursements, which include
money loaned, dues repaid, profits paid un
prepaid stock, salaries, taxes and other
expenses, amount to $12,544,0C7 03 The
borrowers number 12.6C9. Forty-eight as
sociations have maturing stock, and there
were 6243*4 shares matured. There was
$722,949 In dues repaid on matured shares
The report states that there seems to
have been a great difficulty during the
last year in securing acceptable loans by
many of the building and loan associa
tions, and that has caused the diminution
of the capital invested in them, as manv
have declined to sell free stock upon the
ground that they could not make uÂ«e of
the money.

By using the long-distance telephone

lSuts h oÂ°r r chi C h a a g O had already WOn la Su
ation appeared In the New YorK papers
and led to a subscription for their bene
fit. Mrs. Shew, through whose efforts this
was accomplished, testifies that "actual
want and hunger and cold had been borne
by this heroic husband in order to supply
food, medicine and comforts to his dying
wife," and attributes tha utter- wreck of
Poe"s constitution In great part to his
privations during these last months.
In January. 1847. the Ionic struggle
ended. Virginia died and Poe broke down
with brain fever. He recovered, indeed,
and lived for some eighteen mdnths long
er, but he was never himself again. in
fact, it Is hardly fair to regard the ac
tions of his lonesome latter life in any
other light than as those of a man drift-
Ing toward insanity and death and clutch
ing desperateiy at any kindly hand that
seemed held out to save him. In particu
lar he sought the sympathy and support
of women. He may well have shared the
opinions of his friends that his only sal
vation was to be found In marrying some
one who should at once supnort
strengthen and comfort him. It was
sorrow than the failure to achieve world
ly success. During hl3 stay In Philadel
phia his dearly loved child-wife broke u
blood vessel and lay for weeks at death's
door. She seemed to recover only to be
again prostrated. It was to the horrible
alternations of agonizing hope and blank
despair during the six years remaining of
her life in death that Poe attributed his
final loss of power to resist the tempta
tion of seeking relief of unconsciousness
in liquor or laudanum.
"I" took leave of her forever." he said, refer
ring to her first attack, "and underwent all the
agonies of her death. She recovered partially,
and I again hoped. At the end of a year the
vessel broke again. I went through precisely
the same scene. â¢ â¢ â¢ Then againâ againâ
and even once again, at varying intervals. Kach
time I felt all the agonies of her deathâ and at
each accession of the disorder I loved her more
dearly and clung to her life with more desperate
pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensi
tiveânervous in a very unusual degree. I be
came Insane with long Intervals of horrible
sanity. During these nts of absolute uncon
sciousness 1 drank â God knows how often or
how much.
Sunt lacrlmae reram. A stronger man
would perhaps have come through the
trial better and all the tenderer for hi<3
sutterings, but the strain was too great
for the high-strung and sensitive tempera
ment of Poe. After all, in his craving for
a respite from the intervals of horrible
sanity, there is nothing of the greedy de
sire tor vulgar pleasure which marred th<Â»
life of Burn* nor of the weak yielding 10
physical pain which shattered the greater
mind of Coleridge. Yet neit.ier Burns nor
Coleridge has been aa heartily abused Â«n
Poe.
The most outrageous slanders have been
circulated in regard to Poe's treatment
of hia wife. One reverend reviler goes
so far as to charge him with having
caused Virginia's death that he might
have a fitting theme for "The Raven.'"
the fact that this poem appeared two
years before she died in no way affecting
this gentleman's belief in the truth oi his
statement. Others have said or insinu
ated that Poe allowed her to perish slowly
of want and neglect while he wasted his
substance in riotous living. Those who
know anything of the bitter, grinding pov
erty in which Poe continually lived will
realize the improbability of this accusa
tion. But an even better answer 13 the
testimony of an eve witness of the last
months of Virginia's life. Mrs. Gove vis
ited the cottage at Fordhaan in the fall
of 1S46 and found her in the dreadful chills
that accompany consumption. Poe had
thrown his greatcoat over her and sat
cherishing her hands while she hugged
their pet cat to her breast lor warmth.

clety. 1101 Pine street. All correspondence
a u d ?., n Â£ ref l ues ts for further information
should be addressed to them.
To this end we invite and request your co
operation In procuring facts bearing upon our
fcubject. You may possess original informa
obtained, the location or character of relics
that would be of interest or value. You may
be able to suggest a line of inquiry that would
aid our purpose. Historical information flows
from a thousand sources. A reminiscence, a

pit of unwritten biography may be a clew to
important evidence, cr the prolific Bouree of
many unsuspected facts.
The work of Investigation Is to be in
fluenced neither by political nor religious dl
vlFicns. The race is paramount. "Whether it
came from this part of Ireland or that
whether it worshiped at this shrine or that. Is
but a qualifying Incident. We seek the life
and labors of the race. To record Its arrival
Its participation In the civil, political and
military activities of the State, "to try truUi
ruwy and fearlessly to record its achieve

The pocietr. therefore, desires to bepln its
investigations at once and to extend them to
every part of the community, placing them
under the conduct of names that, assuring
painstaking research and Impartial and dis
criminating Judgment, will certainly present
the results of their labor in attractive literary
rorm. so that its work, commanding the re
six-ct and attention of the community, may
have a deflnlto and permanent historical
The pioneers of this State, the men who made
history, are rapidly disappearing. With them
go the original sources of the most valuable
information. If the work which was described
be not undertaken now our posterity will face
the same difficulties that confront our Eastern
brethren in their present search for authentic
information.
Each of the races claiming to form part of
the primal stock of the republic has Its own
historical association and has traced the move
ments of its own blood by special historical
investigation. We have the Etory of the Eng
lish, the Dutch, the Huguenots, the Spaniards.
The story of perhaps the largest fraction
of the parent, people or the republicâ the Irish
is being written. These special researches
are admittedly of the highest value to general
history. They can be prosecuted with great
est success by particular Investigation In each
.State. To this end the Knights of St. Pat
rick desire to initiate a thorough, Bolld, sober
investigation of the Irishman's part In the life
of California. Not to satisfy a prejudice or
mere pride of race, but laboring for right and
truth to impartiality, to set forth the facts of
its racial life, that they may "supply omis
sions, correct errors, allay passions and shame
prejudices."
The society has no political purpose. It
Is composed of men whose proudest boast
is their American citizenship, who under
take their work in the interests of his
torical truth and in defense of an ances
try who have been the frequent target of
an ignorant prejudice or misguided big
otry- The general society has a local or
ganization in nearly every State in the
Vnion. Its work i< now undertaken in
<"alifornia by the Knights of St. Patrick,
who have issued the following circular:
Many noted Americans have interested
tbemSelYca in the society's work, among
others Governor Theodore Roosevelt.
To accomplish this great work with
fcreadth ana accuracy a number of Irish
men of national prominence issued a call
to notable men throughout the United
States. They organized in 1S9C the Amer
ican Irish Historical Society, having for
Its object "the study of American history
generally, to investigate specially the im
migration of the peuple of Ireland to this
country, determine their number, examine
the sources whence they came and learn
ihe places of ttieir settlement; to ex
amine records of every character wher
ever found; to endeavor to correct er
roneous, distorted and false views of his
tory Sn relation to the Irish race in
America."
The Knights of St. Patrick, an organiza
tion of American citizens of Irish birth or
Irish descent, is co-operating with the
American Historical Society for the pur
pose of investigating, recording and pre
senting in literary form a history of the
influence of the Irish element of the pop
ulation in the upbuilding of the republic.
Poe made many bitter enemies, mostly
by the severity of his criticism. His ideals
in literature were at once high and pecu
liar, and he never hestitatcd to lash an
impostor or assail an opponent. But he
was net without friends. Almost without
exception those who knew him best speak
of his modesty, his industry and his ap
preciation of benefits conferred. Toward
women his manner was marked by tha
old-fashioned chivalry of the Virginia
gentleman. He was the idol of his sick
wife and of her gentle and devoted
mother. Not without faults, his very
weakness endeared him the more to the
kind hearts who divined the sorrows of hla
life. All In all. let us say. a man more

call the tragedy. "Man."
Few of those who knew Poe were insen
sible of the fascination of his personal ari^
pearance. He was somewhat over the
averap height, erect and with the unmis
takable stamp of West Point in hl3 bear-
i n n S i i Â£. Was Â°? m arked bodily strength
and In his youth quick at all athletic ex
ercises. In dress he was fastidious but
simple, wearing usually a black coat and
stock carefully brushed, but showing too
often signs of poverty that haunted him
throughout life. His curly black hair was
brushed back from a broad, high fore
head, his face was pale and Intellectual,
haggard in repose, but lighting up at tha
approach of friends. A short black mus
tache only half concealed the habitual
movement of his nervous mouth. But his
great charm lay in his eyes, steel-gray
with an iris that constantly contracted
and expanded, and shining with Intelli
gence and feeling from under the long
black eyelashes.

MENACE TO NAVIGATION.
The Schooner John G. North Passes
Floating Wreckage at Sea.
The schooner John G. North came in
from Honoipu yesterday and report? pass
ing a floating mast last Tuesday. It ap
peared to have been from a small schoon
er or the topmast of a square-rigger. In
his report Captain Austin of the John G.
North says:
"On September 25, In latitude 36 37 north,
120 west, passed what appeared tc be a
broken mast in an upright position. It
showed up about ten feet above the sur
face. It was either the mast of a small
vessel submerged or else t^e topmast of
a square-rigger with yards and hamper
below water. Either supposition accounts
for the upright position of the mast."
The question now arises what vessel the
Â¦wreckage is from. Many vessels *vere off
port during last Sunday's nor'wester,
but to say that any one of them has gone
down would be mere speculation. Seafar
ing men seem to think that within the
next day or so a partially dismasted ves
sel will comeÂ« in and this mystery of the
ccean will be solved.

The Alaska Commercial Company's St.

loaded down with freight and carried
about twenty passengers. " .
The tug Columbia sailed from Coos Bay
vesterday with the new steamer Man
dalay in tow.
THE Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany has contracted for the con
struction of a splendid new
Btcamer for the Alaskan trade.
She will be 270 feet long, 40 feet
beam and 19 feet 6 Inches depth of hold.
She will carry 1350 tons of freight and coal
and will accommodate 162 first class cabin
passengers and 100 second class passen
gers. Everything in the equipment of the
vessel will be modern. She will be fitted
throughout with electric lights and elec
tric hoists, so that the Jar and discomfort
thai accompanies the discharging of cargo
by means of steam will be done away
with.
The new vessel is to be named the Spo
kane. ShÂ© will have three decks besides
the "texas." There will be two tiers of
staterooms. Tho after end of the upper
house will be used as an observatory. The
half-circle will be fitted with plate glass
and all the cabin passengers will be able
to view the glories' of an Alaskan sunset
without exposing themselves to the Arctic
climate.
Strange to say, the Spokane will be
fitted with a refrigerating plant. Game,
poultry and all kinds of dainties will be
put aboard the ship at Seattle, so that
those who go north on the Spokane may
enjey the best of fare.
The Spokane is to be built by the Union
Iron Works. The contract is let, and as
soon as the first torpedo-boat now under
construction is launched her keel will be
laid. In model she somewhat resembles
the Queen, but as far as accommodation
Is concerned she outclasses that vessel in
every respect.
The Spokane is to have a double bottom
and bulkheads that will prevent a dis
aster, no matter in what form the danger
comes. She is expected to easily make
fifteen knots an hour, and the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company expects to have
her in commission next summer.
probably with this end in view that ha
became engaged to Mrs. Whitman. Tho
engagement was brought about against
her better judgment by his passionate ap
peal, not so much for love as for rescue,
and was broken off after a dreadful scene
in which she confessed that she loved,
but dared not marry him. The two inci
dents have been distorted by Grlswotd
into the shameful slander that Poe visit
ed her house in such a state of Intoxica
tion that the police had to be called in.
He engaged about the same time In a
long and emotional correspondence with a
married woman to whom he addressed
the lines "For Annie," a poem which ex
presses as nothing else could do that
craving of the body for the repose of
death, which at this time dominated, thÂ«
poet's mind. In the last weeks or his Ufa
even he seems once more to have formed
an engagement, this time with an old 1
friend in Virginia.
A certain mystery hangs over the causa
of Poe's death. The common story that
he died from the results of a drunken
spree seems to have no better authority
than Griswold's statement, and we havo
already sesn how little this person la to
be trusted. Mr. Sartain believes that he
was drugged and robbed by a pair of
rogues who were seen following him In
Baltimore. All we know is that he was
found unconscious in the streets of that
It is not the purpose of this article to
follow in detail the checkered life of Poe
in New York and Philadelphia. The hopes
with which he had come northward
proved false. He succeeded, it Is true. In
getting his longest story, the "Narrative
of Arthur Gordon Pym," printed by thÂ«j
Harpers, but it attracted little attention
In this country, and. although the pirated
English edition proved very successful,
Poe never received a penny from thlÂ»
source. He was reduced at one time to
the editing of a textbook on conchology,
a piece of bread-and-butter work over
whose originality there has been an ab
surd dispute. For his own original and
unique work he received at this time little
or nothing. The Harpers refused a collec
tion of his tales offered to them for noth
ing, as "too obscure and refined for the
public." Moxon in England refused Dick
ens' request to publish an authorized ver
sion of these stories. A Philadelphia firm
undertook their publication, allowing Poe
the munificent remuneration of twenty
copies for his friends. But they had cause
to regret their rashness, for we find them
a little later complaining that the work
had not returned them the expense of
publication. For such work as "Ligela"
he received from forgotten Baitimora
magazines $5 or 110 an article. He actc 1
as assistant editor on various periodicals
at the usual rate of $50 a month, includ
ing contributions; at one time. Indeed, he
estimated his pay for proofreading, re
vision, compilation and general superin
tendence at about $4 a week.
Poe never long retained his position on
the staff of a magazine, a fact uniformly
attributed to his bad habits. But not a
single discharge on any ground is re
corded against him, and two at least of
his employers were quick to take up his
cause against Griswold's defamation. But
it is very probable that Poe was not an
easy-going hack. Proud and shy, given
to brooding over WTong, real and imagin
ary, bitterly detesting the commercial in
fluences which then dictated the utter
ances of periodicals, he was restless in
harness and moved too readily from one
post to another. Throughout his l..e,
moreover, he cherished the idea of found
ing a magazine of his own, which should
be based upon merit and form the organ
for what he loved to call "The Aristocracy
of Letters."
A chance came to him at last when ho
obtained control of the Broadway Journal,
but the necessary funds for Its support
were wanting, and it broke down just as
it seemed on the point of success. Poe
has been ridiculed for his assertions of
what a magazine such as he had in mind
might be and do. ' But the truth Is he was
the first man in this country to recognize
the vast field that was opening .'or period
ical literature, and his own experience,
particularly on Graham's Magazine,
where in a year the circulation rose from
S000 to 40,000, made him sanguine of suc
cess. As an original writer Poe never re
ceived the recognition he merited; as an
editor he never obtained the opportunity
he desired. Small wonder that he became
gloomy, suspicious and pessimistic when
snarling rivals assailed him on every
side and one hope after another failed.
But Poe had a deeper and more Intimate

Remarkable Success of a New Treat-

?k 1 '? 1 '*^ 81 *' 7 , year3 u has heen "upposed
that the Qnly absolutely sure curÂ» for
piles waa by surgical operation, but tho
danger to life and the pain and wepensa
has been so great that many thousands
suffer for years rather than submit to
this last resort: or they seek the tempo-
rary reller in the many remedies claimed
to relieve piles and rectal troubles salves
ointments and similar simple remedies

A, new preparation, which is painless
and harmless, but which 3ffords imme-
diate relief and in many cases a complete
cure in a very short time, is sold bv drug-
gists under the name of Pyramid Pile
.Cure.
It Is In suppository form, used at night
and Its regular use has cured thousands
of obstinate, long-standing 1 cases, and It
seems to be equally effective in all the
various forms of piles, whether itchlnjr.
bleeding or protruding.
The Pyramid Pile Cure allays the In-
flammation and Intolerable Itching, re-
duces the tumors, and its astringent pro-
perties cause the enlarged blood vessels
to contract to a normal, healthy condition.
A Baltimore gentleman relates hia ex-
perience with the Pyramid Pile Cure in
these words:
"It affords mo unusual pleasure to add
my Indorsement to those of others rela-
tive to your really wonderful pile remedy.
I was a sufferer for years until told by a
fellow salesman of the Pyramid Pile Cure.
It has entirely cured me and I cheerfully
send this for publication if you wish to
use It in that direction. I wish you would
send me one of your little books on cause
and cure of piles, I desire to show It to
some friends. ' * a
Any pile sufferer may use the Pyramid
with certainty that It Â¦ will give instant
relief and regular use a permanent curÂ«
and the still further certainty that it con-
tains no cocaine, morphine or metallic or
mineral poison.
All druggists sell Pyramid Pile Cur*. 50
cents for full sized treatment.

CHICAGO, Sept. 29.â The Times-Herald
to-morrow will say: Senator William A.
Clark of Montana yesterday consummated
plans for the building of the Los Angeles
and Salt Lake City Hallway. Senator
Clark has been staying at the Annex since
Thursday last, but' remained over another
day to consult with Salt Lake City and
Los Angeles capitalists.
Another chief promoter is R. C. Kerens
of St. "Louis. Besides Mr. Clark and Mr-
Kerens the participants in the conference
were A. "W*. McCune of Salt Lake and Sen
ator Clark's brother, J. Ross Clark of Los
Angeles.
Senator Clark admitted the truth of the
story, but said the consultation had not
determined upon any -finalities and that
the facts were not yet in a state for pub
lication.
R. C. Kerens went further, stating that
the new Los Angeles and Salt Lake City
Hallway, absorbs the franchise and prop
erty of the Los Angeles Terminal com
pany. This provides for the entrance of
the new railway into the Southern Cali
fornia metropolis. The Mormon church
has practically promised a terminal site
in the Utah capital, and Pioneer Square,
a tract of ten acres in the center of the
city, will be turned over to the railway
for its passenger and freight stations.
Between the termini the whole un
opened Southwest will be spanned. - Tha
Sierra Nevadas will be pierced through
one of the southern passes, and the su
premacy of the Southern Pacific Rail
way, hitherto unchalJdnged on the Pa
cific Coast, will be effectually broken at
least in Southern California. The death
of Collia P. Huntington removed the last
obstacle to the,, success of the * Clark-
Kerens syndicate.
The construction will require $25.000,0<X>
in expenditure. The syndicate has In Its
eye a vast commercial development.
Southern Utah and Eastern Nevada
"contain coal and the beat iron ore. besides
the precious metals. The region will some
day be the Pennsylvania of the West.
Said R. C. Kerens :
"We contemplate a second Illinois Steel
"Works there. We mean to make the Iron
"and steel for the entire Pacific "West.
Surveys have revealed the richness of the
country through Which we shall pass In
the useful metals, and we purpose to es
tablish great smelters and metal works."

HAZLETON, Pa., Sept. 29.â All negotia
tions between G. B. Markle & Co. and
their employes are . off, and arbitration
has received Its first serious blow In the
present struggle between j the miners and
mine-owners. To-night the committee of
employes which presented grievances to
the firm sent the following communica
tion to John Markle, the managing part
ner of the firm: :
WVe, the undersigned, committee of em
ployes of G. B. Markle & Co., appointed
to arrange for arbitration' under the
agreement between the firm and the men.
do report that the agreement is broken by
the employes.".
Much Interest was felt in the arbitra
tion plan of the Markles, it being believed
that' other individual operators and possi
bly the big railroads which have mining
interests would follow suit if the plan was
successfully carried out. ..
- A member of the firm, when seen lato
to-night; said:
"It looks very much as if it Is all up.
There is no other way to look at it."

Resolved. .That we unqualifiedly denouncs
the willful and malicious manufacture and
circulation of false and wholly imaginary ru

DENVER, Sept. 29.â At a large meeting
at the, Broadway theater to-night held
under the auspices of tha Arapahoa
County Democracy, resolutions were In
troduced by Governor C. S. Thomas and
passed concerning- the Incident "at Victor
recently during the visit of Governor
Roosevelt and party. After stating that
tlÂ»e "disorder was provoked b'y tha pres

the conduct of Senator E.O. Wolcott."
and that "during the progress of Gov

depot a fight took place between certain
Republicans who mistook each other for
disturbers of the peace," the resolutions
continue:

I have no doubt how this campaign will end.
I see on every side the proof that Justice will
triumph now, as It has always triumphed In
this country- I cannot believe that a republic
Is in danger that is built upon all the virtues
which humanity has developed and which i3 in
itself the supreme outcome of Christian civili
zation. That all men are equal before tho law
Is the natural fruit of Christianity. It will
remain while Christian civilization, enlightens
the world and stimulates the heart of man.- As
long as man is destined to Justice, to progress.
as lone as his eye Is fixed upon the eternal
truths of heaven the flag of this country,
typifying justice, the constitution which it se
cures, inseparable, Indestructable and Invin

In conclusion he said:
BOISE, Idaho. Sept. 29.â The Populist
executive committee, by a vote of 3 to 2,
decided to place Democratic â¢ candidates
for Governor and Attorney General On the
Populist ticket. They offered to file the
nomination "of Frank W. Hunt for Gov
ernor, but it was refused by tho Secretary
of State on the ground that there was not
sufficient showing of authority of the
committee to make the nomination. 'They
also again offered to file the nomination
for Democratic Elector Rich, but It was
refused for the same. reason. .

VICTOR. Colo., Sept. 29.â The Teiler
County Democratic Convention and the
Democratic Club of Victor adopted the
following resolutions unanimously:
Whereas. Governor Roosevelt and party were
not received in Victor with the tolerance and
courtesy due to the .Governor of a sister State;
Resolved. That we, 'the Democrats of Victor,
in convention assembled, condemn the spirit of
intolerance and discourtesy exhibited on that
occasion and disavow all responsibility for the
disturbance of the speakers in a public hall
and for the subsequent violence Indulged In by
members of the Republican Marching Club;
further
The Republican candidate offers us profes
sions of morality -which are the most unex
ceptional. We find him shooting down peo
ple in the Eastern islands and professing the
utmost affection for them and the utmost re
gard for their prospects. Ho tells us that Â¦ he
Is opposed xo Imperialism, and yet he is seek
ing to establish a government at once arbi
trary and of unlimited powers. He affects to
resent the asertion that be is introducing
militarism Into the United States, and. yet we
find the army has been quadrupled during his
administration Â¦ and a policy established which
will lead to further armament if it should be
successful at the polls.
Stated in Us very narrowest compass, the
issue before the American people is the right
of this Government to seize distant territory
and. govern It against the will of its inhabi
tants, not under, our constitutional govern
ment, but through offlce-hoiders to be named
by the President, who will administer Â¦ their
functions outside the constitution, and Inde
pendently of its limits. Now, I apprehend
there can be no difference between a Re
publican and a Democrat as to the statement
at issue. On the one side tho Republican*
contend, inasmuch as the extra constitutional
powers -are to be exercised outside the United
States, imperialism, bo far as this country is
concerned, Is not an issue of this campaign
and they go on to say that even if it were dan
gerous they would still - be bound ; to vote for
it, because to defeat it by the election of the
Democratlo candidate would be to bring about
a money panic and that would be too great a
price to pay for the security of democratlo in
stitutions. Now, to that the Democrats an
swer that such a policy, would be in violation
of the principles that Bovernment' derives it
Just powers from the consent of the governed
and that it would be Infamous to repudiate in
our hour of strength ' the principle which we
invoked in our hour of weakness. ..They con
tend further that despotic or arbitrary powers
cannot be connrled to officers of a republican
government without, j endangering I the Integrity
of democratic - institutions. And, . lastly, . they
contend that 8lnc& republican government is
shown by the . history of the world, since I the
establishment of this Government, to have been
the fountain of the greatest prosperity, that
mankind ever enjoyed, its preservation can
not Â¦ endanger prosperity, but must contribute
to Its permanence and to Its growth. .

Here a shout for Bryan was heard.
Cries of "Put him out" and shouts for
McKlnley were made. Mr. Roosevelt con
tinued:
"Xo, let him ehout for Bryan and Agul

for heaven's sako do not let him mention
General Funston in connection with

"I fail to see how in this town there

CHANUTE, Kans., Sppt. 29.â Governor
Roosevelt's train reached Iola at 11
o'clock this morning. He spoke for a few
moments from the rear platform of â¢ the
car. He said:
At Fort Scott, Kans., Gov. Roosevelt
addressed a meeting for three-quarters of
an hour, dwelling- upon the issues of mili
tarism, imperialism and expansion. At
one point in hia more than ordinary im
pas. ioned e address he exclaimed: "I feel
as if I were approaching a crusade. I
don't feel as If this were an ordinary
political, contest. I feel that I have a
riphr to appeal to the manhood of every
American as we appealed to It in the days
of the Civil War.- I ask you to stand with
us -for the pake- of the orderly liberty
which Is 'the corrferstone of this republic
and for the sake of preserving the na
tional prosperity which we have now at
tained/'.
At Cherry-vale, Chanute, Parsons, Cher
okee, Weir City, Pittsburg, Pleasanton,
i'aola and Olathe short stops were made,
and at ;ome places where no stops were
made at ail considerable crowds assem
bled on the platforms of the stations to
cheer the train as It passed.
which continued for three-quarters of an
hour. He called attention to the prosper
ity of the country, contrasting the eco
nomic conditions now with 'what they
were four years ago. He dwelt somewhat
upon the prophecies of Mr. Bryan and
Fhowed how those prophecies had not
come to pass. On the whole the welcome
and demonstrations at the two meetings
and on the streets was something seldom
Witnessed anywhere.
Governor Itoosevdt will spend Sunday
at the Midland Hotel. He will attend the
Dutch Reformed Church in the morning
and In the afternoon will take a gallop
into the country with some friends. He
will see no callers and attend no func
tions. He will rest and sleep and prepare
for his Nebraska tour during the coming
week.

open-air meeting? was held. On being in
troduced' to the vast assembly an organ
ized effort was made by a larg-e number
of men and boys on the edge cf the crowd
to prevent his making a speech. Cries
and interruptions were frequent during
the first moments. Each interruption was
followed with hard hits from the speaker
until quiet was restored, and the greater
part of his speech was listened to in re
spectful silence.
On the conclusion of bis Armourdale ad

JUMPS IN FRONT
OF MOVING CAR
AND IS KILLED
An Unknown Young Man
Horribly Mailed on
Mission Street.
'I . â â¢
Drops Pair of Pincers and While
Trying to Recover Them Is
Struck and Fatally
Injured.
Â»
A young 1 man, unknown to those irhÂ»
picked him up, was last night struck by s
Mission street car at Sixth street and al
most instantly killed. He was riding on a
wrest bound car, and when opposite Sixth
street a pair of pincers dropped out of hla
pocket. Without signaling the conductor
to stop the unfortunate man jumped off in
front of an east bound car to recover the
tool and was fatally injured. He was at
once removed to a drugstore in the vicin
ity. It was apparent that he was beyond
all human aid, but he was sent to the Re
ceiving Hospital. An examination there
Bhowed that the young man's skull was
fractured and his left leg broken. Besides
this he was internally injured. A few
minutes after being placed on the oper
ating table the unfortunate breathed his
last.
"When he got on the car the young man
had a small parcel under his arm, which
contained two dressed ducks and which he
I ostensibly intended to take home. On
jumping to recover the pincers he placed
1 the parcel on the seat of tho dummy, after
telling one of the passengers to look out
for it.
According to the motorman. who is
: named F. H. Johnson, he then jumped in
front of the car going to the ferries. John
son was arrested immediately after the
accident and charged with manslaughter.
He â¢ was at once released on bonds. He
says that he was within a few feet of the
Â¦west bound car 'when he saw the .victim
of the car Jump. He instantly reversed the
current, but too late to save the man's
S life.
Up to a late hour last night the unfortu
1 nate man had not been identified.

EX-JUDGE LOW WILL
SPRING A SENSATION
He Intends to Prefer Charges Against
Captain Seymour Before the
; . . Police Board.
Ex-Judge Low intends to spring a big
sensation in a few days which he . says
will paralyze the Police Department. He
will prefer a charge against Captain Sey
mour before the Police Commissioners,
backed up by affidavits, that the captain
is working in the interests of a certain at
torney against him and other attorneys.
Low is attorney for William Tyndall,
alias A. C. Adams, the man who repre
sented himself as President M. Stone of
the San Pedro and I. X. L. Dairy Com
pany, and was charged with forgery. The
Judge alleges In effect that he was re
fused a permit to see Tyndall in the prison
for the reason that Attorney Joseph
Dunne was preferred by. Captain Seymour.
It is known that Captain Seymour is the
man aimed at, although Low will only say
it Is a man high up in the department.
Captain Seymour said yesterday . that
Low should be careful before bringing
such a charge against him or any other
member of the department, as there was
absolutely no truth in it. "Low was never
refused a permit," said the captain, "and
when Tyndall asked me whether he would
employ Low, Dunne or Walter Gallagher
to defend him, I told him he could do as
he liked. The trouble with Low is that I
refused to allow him to enter the prison
and examine the register of arrests to see
which of the prisoners had money on
them, so that he could get their, cases.
Since then he has had it in for me and
the department generally. When I took
charge of the prison I gave orders that
no attorney would be permitted to see a
prisoner without an order, and that rule
has since acted well. I shall see that it is
enforced to stop the grafting that used to
be carried on."

Bed Men as Minstrels.
Oshonee Tribe No. 78, Improved Or"der
cf Red Men, gave an entertaining minstrel,
performance to a crowded house at
Union-square Hall last night. George
Cheney was interlocutor and Elton Lam
bert, Ed Kreiss, Peter Howell and Will
Brackett were end men. Ed Kreiss, a
clever and popular amateur minstrel and
buck and wing dancer, sang "I Wouldn't
Leave My Home If I Were you," and was
heartily encored. Elton Lambert sang
with great success "I Couldn't Stand to
See My Baby Loose." George Cheney's
song, "The Curse of the Dreamer." .was
well received. . The entertainment con
cluded with a dance. The success of the
affair was due mainly to the commlttep of
arrangements, consisting of the following:
Meyer Bloom, A. Scholes, A. L. Pringle,
V. Howell, E. E. David, T. Kelley and EU
Peterson. . i
Governor F. W. Rollins of New Hamp
shire arrived in the city last evening. The
Governor's trip to the coast is purely of a
business riature and he expects to remain
here two or three weeks. He is the junior
member of the firm of E. H. Rollins & Co.,
bond buyers, with headquarters In Bostqp.
The firm has a branch office in this city.
The Governor has business interests in
IjOS Angeles which will take him to that
city for a few days. Tills Is his first visit
to the coast. While in the city he will be
the guest of the Union League Club,
which will hold a reception in his honor
some evening this week.
Governor Rollins was met at the ferry
station by A. G. . Booth, president of the
Union League Club, and Colonel Pippy of
Governor Gage's staff. The party dined
at the Palace, where the New Hampshire
executive will make his headquarters
while in the city.
Governor Rollins has the distinction of
being the youngest Governor of any State
in the Union. He was elected by the Re
publicans in 1S99 for two years by an over
whelming majority. He came to San
Francisco direct from Concord, where he
completed a series of stump speeches for
McKinley and Roosevelt.
Governor Rollins is confident of Repub
lican victory in November. His State will
give McKinley from 15,000 to 20j[)00 plurality.
New , Hampshire has supported the Re
publican nominee for forty years, with but
a single exception. In 1S96, McKinley re
ceived over 20,000 plurality.
The Governor says that the Republicans
must wage their hardest* fights In New
York and Indiana: Just now the Empire
State is on the doubtful list, but he thinks
that hard work there will insure Republi
can victory.
Governor Rollins stopped at Chicago
and -'visited the national headquarters,
where he found that the greatest confi
dence was felt that the election would re
sult in a Republican victory. ,
Governor Rollins does not think the
strike of the coal miners will injure Mc-
Kinley's chances. He believes that all
these labor troubles will be amicably set
tled before election. In regard to the at
tack upon Governor Roosevelt in Colorado
neither party, he thinks, can iin any way
be held responsible, and the episode is not
likely to change any votes either way.
F. W.' Rollins Predicts the
Election of McKinley
and Roosevelt.

Sala^sa and Ferrari, both now at tlif
Tivoli. and Bellagamba. who made his
first appearance last night as Amourftso.
He is a foeman worthy of the great Tivoll
barytone's steel. In Aniouraso he fs per
haps finer than Salassa. "With a rare,
smooth, tremendous voice and a full con
ception of the dramatic exigencies of the
part, Bellagamba made a brilliant. impres-
Flon on his audience last evening. In
Lulgi Lucent! the company possesses a
genuine basso profundo, and his Ramphis
was excellently sung. Egidlo Garanaglio
also made a good king.
Casteliano, the dramatic tenor of the
company, has a fine, brilliant- voice. He
takes his higher notes with marvelous
ease, and the tone quality is beautiful.
He has an excellent climax and his Rada
mes was an altogether satisfying Inter
pretation.
The company fs happy in the possession
of perhaps the best Aida that has been
heard here for years in the person of Nice
Barbareschl. who gave an altogether
peasing rendering of the part. Her make
up was noticeably goodâ the only Aida
within memory without a piebald integu
mentâand the tender, wild, loving slave
girl was fully safe In her hands. It is a
velvet voice, the Barbareschi's. even, clear
and flf-xible. Beatrice Franco, who sub
stituted for Coliarmarina in the. part of
Amnerls, has a light contralto, more prop
erly a mezzo-soprano, of agreeable qual
ity, but she is hardly equal to the dra
matic demands of the jealous princess'
role.
The chorus work is fairly good and the
orchestra Is handled in masterly fashion
by the leader, Signor Azzaii, who certain
ly makes the most of its somewhat hete
rogenous elements.
"Carmen," with its famous exponent of
the name part, Collamarini, will be given
this evening.
CARL KRUGER. a: nurseryman,
who resided at 1236. Chestnut
street with his wife and â¢ four
young children, committed suicide
yesterday Â¦ in a sensational man
ner. He Jumped into space from the
the second balcony In the rotunda of the
City Hall dome. He was taken to the
Receivlnsr Hospital, but died in about an
hour. His skull was fractured and the
bones of both ankles and his left leg were
bioken.
A bronze railing about three and a half
feet high surrounds the balcony, and it
Is supposed that Kruger stood on top of
this railing and sprang forward Into
space. - No one saw him actually take the
Jump, but David R. Reese, a miner living
at 29 Twelfth street, who was on the
west side of the first balcony, saw Kruger
whirling through the air from the second
balcony. Leo de Cardona, a copyist in
the County Clerk's office, was on his way
to- lunch at the time. He was walking
across the floor of the dome when some
thing brushed his left arm, followed by a
heavy fall. He wheeled around, thinking
that some one had thrown something at
him, and wa3 horrified to see Kruger ly
ing on his back on the floor beside him,
with his arms outstretched and blood
pouring from a wound in the back of his
head.
Cardona almost fainted at his narrow
escape, and as soon as he recovered him
self he hurried to the Receiving Hospital
for a physician. Paul A. Dunphy, 812
Eddy street, who saw Kruger strike the
floor, also ran to the Institution. The am
bulance was summoned and Kruger, who
was unconscious, was taken to the hos
pital. He died in about an hour. The
body was removed to the Morgue.
It was at first thought that Kruger had
fallen accidentally from the first balcony,
as the guard placed there to prevent peo
ple from stepping into space is but eight
een Inches high, but the place at which
he struck the floor showed this theory to
be incorrect. Incidentally It may be said
that the attention of the Grand Jury has
been drawn to the menace to life that
exists through there not being a proper
railing around the first balcony. It Is
surprising that no serious accidents have
occurred from this lack of protection.
Detective T. B. Gibson was detailed on
the case and he notified Mrs. Kruger of
the serious accident to her husband. She
told him that her husband was a native of
Chile. 38 years of age. He had been for
twenty years connected with the nursery
firm of Sievers & Boland, 25 Post street,
and for some time had an Interest in the
business. He looked after the big nursery
and the strain upon him brought on ner
vous prostration. He- had been very bad
for the last three months and his phy
sician induced him to give up business for
a time and seek a change of climate.
About a month ago he sold out his share
in the business to Sievers and went to
Los Angeles. He returned some days ago
and had apparently recovered from his
illness. He tried to get back hla
Interest In the nursery, but failed, and
became despondent. Mrs. Kruger told
her husband to consult a doctor and he
left the house yesterday morning, as she
thought, to do so.
Mrs. Kruger is not left without means.
Kruger owned some propertv in Berkeley,
on which he recently paid off a mortgage.

DORUTHY~BREY'S LETTER.
Her Otssrvatlons of Nervous
Women, and a Practical Hint
Which May Prove HelpfuL
I have come to the conclusion that
women who are nervous deserve a
preat deal more sympathy than they
pet. Indeed, if there is one person
who more than another deserves every-
body's pity and everybody's help it is
the nervous woman. The woman, I
mean, who flies all to pieces a dozen
times a day over some trifle that really
doesn't matter, and she can't help
doicp; it any more than a person vith
the asrue can help shaking. I know a
lot of women who are nervous and get
excited over small things. I have
found them In every place I've been,
Washington. New York* New Orleans.
Sail Francisco. St. Louis. Boston â
every place where I've made Intimate
women friends. It Isn't merely the
married women and the mothe:*8 that
are so easily excited and Irritated, but
it's the girls, too.
Now. of course, one can't observe
these things without their making an
impression, so I l->Â«gan to make In-
quiry as to the causes, and have found !
In every single case that the woman!
was really sick and needed treatment, j
perhaps was setting treatment at the
time. When you come to think about
it. nervousness must be very wide- |
spread among women, and these poor j
pouls who are really suffering get no-
body's sympathy because they are so
snappish.
For ir.y part. I believe that nervous-
ness 5:: women is always a symptom
of some female trouble, some little
thinpr that began way back in girlhood,
ard kept on developing and aggrava-
ting the nerves. If a girl loses her j
temper ar.d says things that are spite-
ful, it is customary to draw a placid
elph and say. '"she'll get over that
when she's married ar.d settled." Of
course she doesn't get over it. Ten
chances to one rhe gets worse, and j
becomes the shrewish wife and irri- j
table mother. What chance has a mod-
erately well-disposed man to make
Euch a woman happy? If he "humors"
her she prows more violent, and if he
getsfserappy, too, they lead a cat and
dog iife. No. the young girl who says <
spiteful things is likely to become a ;
chronic scold when she has children
ard be a trial to her husband all his
life lor.?. The mysterious part of this
is that the woman after a while doesn't
realize how frequently she exhibits
temper and says mean things* But
the whole thing is a horrible pity,
if one could stop long enough to think
It over seriously. I have done what
little I could for a number of such
women by advising them to take Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
I did this first at the urgent request of
my mother, who is, by the way, quite
the sweetest tempered woman in the
world, and the result surprised me a
" great deal. I had read and read the
advertisements of Mrs. Pinkham's
medicine, but I never really thought
it could be all that they said it was
until I had seen its effect. I feel now
that the dozen or more women who
have taken this medicine at my sug-
gestion have proved its sterling worth
beyond all possible question, and I
wish to say in all seriousness and sol-
eninity that if every nervous woman
would take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
: table Compound, she would soon begin
"to have herself in control.
There really Is need of a movement
to provide some way to help these ner-
vous women. They don't make the
right kind of mothers, or wives, or sis-
ters, and they shouldn't be expected
to. because they are, I am convinced,
'really * unable to control their nerves.
There is no more important thing for
American women than to understand
a little about themselves, and to find
'out what to do to make their lives
-effective. My observation has shown
me unmistakably that profound igno-
rance about things feminine exists
among women: even the traditions
that are handed around are based on
some false premises. It really is no
Â¦wonder that women are sick so much
and played out so early in life. For
the most part they are mismanaged
when young and continue to mlsman-
ape themselves when they prow up.
I would not have any woman think
these words are meant to be harsh or
unkind. If they start some woman
thinking and induce her to protect
herself I will be glad, for I am really-
very much in earnest about it.

The most prominent candidates for Mri

are Marshall B. Woodworth and Henry

cessor. Mr. Foote was a life-long Demo

McKinley man since that time. Mr. Wood

present is Assistant United States Attor
ney. He has achieved a good reputation
already for his knowledge of Federal law
and procedure, and although a m?ich>
younger man than General Foote, makes
up In weight of legal lore what he max

friends are L confident that he will secure
the appointment. ... ' -

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN FRANCISCO ought to be
worthily represented In the Legis
lature and special care should be
taken in the selection of men to
serve in the Senate, as the Sen
ators' hold office for the term of four
years, or two regular sessions of the Leg
islature. There are many indications that
the voters this year will exercise in a re
markable degree the privilege of Inde
pendent voting. So far as the legislative
tickets In this city are concerned there are
no party lines. Republicans and Demo
crats were preparing for their respective
conventions under the Stratton primary
law when the Supreme Court decision
overthrowing the law was announced. The
Immediate result was confusion In local
affairs. Leading citizens who had planned
to take an active part In the creation of
lawful nominating conventions lost all in
terest In the enterprise as soon as they
were denied the protection of law. The
associated bosses of the Republican party, |
headed by Martin Kelly, an enemy of good
government, Immediately planned to stuff
the ballot-bcxes of a "go as you please"
primary. Good citizens of the party were
not allowed to participate In the election
of delegates to the convention. In dis
tricts where the taxpaylng citizens turned"
out to vote the henchmen of Martin Kelly
pent repeaters to stuff the boxes with
fraudulent ballots. By fraud, violence
and all other lawless methods known to
rounders and repeaters the Mint saloon
bosses gained control of the nominating
convention.
In the Democratic party of San Fran
cisco there was no pretense of popular
representation in the convention. District
Â¦ clubs comprising what is known as the
â¢'organization" appointed delegates to - a
convention and the nominations were be
stowed by Gavin McNab and Jasper Mc-
Donald.
In view of the peculiar position of local
affairs It Is not surprising that citizens
have generally resolved to vote for the
best candidates In the. field, regardless of
party designation.
The clean, square and honorable Re
publicans of San Francisco knew that
they were not represented in Martin
Kelly'." B'nai B'rith Hall convention:
hence they justly proclaim that they are
under no obligation as Republicans to
yield their support to the Kelly ticket.
In certain Senatorial and Assembly dis
trict conventions where Kelly failed to
control the legislative nominations rep
utable Republicans were" placed on . the
tickets, and such nominations are deserv
ing of support.
The Call has made diligent Investigation

us define the term and let us see if the policy
of the Republican party deserves not to be
classed as Imperialistic and not republican.
For all this, my friends, what palliation do
â¢ our Republican friends offer? They prate in
high-bounding phrase and appeal to the rever
ence- or the people for the flag. If It Is meant
that wherever our soldiers have ra!eed the flag [
It shall be defended against assault the senti
ment Is praiseworthy. If they mean that.
whfrcvfr it has been carried by the fortunes
of nar there It shall remain forever, they are
false to themselves' ar.d false to the teachings
of history. Not long ago I stood and looked
those hoary groves that raw the legions of
Cortez and the truceless battles of warring
tribes. I lookod at the heights and my mind
recalled the story of that September mornlnp
when the introni.1 Howard scaled the heights
and unfurled the flap of this republic. We had
conquprcd a colony of old Spain. When I
was there, however, another flag was flying to
the hrrr^e; the flasr of n new republic, a re
public b.ised on the principles and precepts of
ours. r>ld It involve a diminution of national
honor to pull down that flag?
? â¢ â¢
N'ow. my friends, these *re great question*.
Maybe before this campaign closes I will have
an opportunity of more fully addressing- you
upon them. My countrymen, the battle is on.
Gird your loins, arm yourself like the warriors
of Israel fcr the conflict. Two banners are
in the fky â the banner of Democracy and the
banner cf Imperialism. As you prepare for
this contest be not dismayed, be of good cheer,
let the star of hope Inspire and guide youi
steps. All men are created free and equal.
Spirit ot liberty, think not in this thy day of
trial, when enemies are gathering, thy children
will deport you. They come from the nation's
ends. Their battle cry drowns the thunder
fwfar on thy altar that the government of the
people, by the people and for the people shall
not perish from the earth.
At the close of Mr. Delmas* speech th?
audience cheered him for several minutes,
and many forced thdr way to the plat
form to shake his hand. The meeting then
adjourned.

The world has peen the territory of the origi

It reached, by natural expansion, its limits;

Were these, my friends, the words of a hypo
crite? Were they utterances of a demagogue
who was attempting to palm off a sham on an
unsuspecting audience? The man who uttered
these words had long ago passed the allotted
period of three score years and ten. He was a
man who had more than half a century's ex
perience as a legislator and who for more than
twenty years had been a Senator of the United
Etates. Did Senator Fairbanks when he heard
these words believe that George F. Hoar was
a hypocrite? The Issue, then. Is whether the
people of the United States will change their
republic Into an empire: whether, in fine, the
great bulwark of our liberties, the constitu
tion. Impregnable from without, shall be as
sailed from within. The Democracy Is not at
tempting to deceive th? people when it tells
them that the Issue Is l?etween a republic and
an empire. The question brooks no delay. It
murt be solved and -solved now. Think not.
my honest but deluded Republican friends, that
you can defer the solution till four years hence.
Think not that the remedy may be found with
in your own' rarty. It Is already Irrevocably
committed to Imperialism. Tyranny when once
started on its course never takes a backward
Btep. It marches forward until It reaches the
brink and sinks Into the abyss of revolution.
Solve it now. make your choice to-day, and
let your choice be a sober, prayerful choice.
Ask yourselves what It is you are urged to turn
your baok upon and what you are offered In
exchange. What has been the history and the
course of the United States la the past?
â¢ â¢ â¢
Let me present to your calm consideration
a few facts. Nearly two and a half years
ago. on May 23. 1S38. or before the reverbera
tion of the cannon of Dewey's fleet had died
upon our ears, a thoughtful address was de
livered la which these pregnant words were
spoken. "We have followed the npirit of
WaKiiington's address until the movement of
fclstrry has brought us to the parting of th<?
ways. Federalism or Imperialism? Which
shall it be?" Why should we seek outRlde cf
the Republican party authority and draw
proofs that the true question presented for our
decision Is that the Democratic party main
tains It is. At the beginning of the present
campaign a. leader In the Republican party ut
tered these words: "I believe, Mr. President,
rot only that perseverance in this policy"â
and he was speaking of the policy then and
now adhered to at Washingtonâ "will result In
the abandonment cf the principles upon which
our republic was founded and will turn It
into an empire. I also believe perslstencey
will result In the defeat of the Republican
party. Whether the great bulwark of the re
publicâthe American constitutionâ Is to be
trampled and beaten down. Is now the ques
tion. Self-government and self-control are
passing away. I appeal from the empire to
the republic. I appeal from the present to the
future, to the past."
Let me ask what has prompted these emi
nent Republicans to sever ties which have
bound them bo long? Will you. my Republican
friend?, ascribe their actions to low and sordid
and unpatriotic motives? For very shame, you
dare not. If these are the motives that
prompted George S. Boutwell, what does he
seÂ» to-day In the Republican party* that he
should desert It? "What does he see In the
Democratic standard -that be should, enlist un
der its folds? He, himself, has answered. He
sees In the Republican party a party whose
principles are oppressive and tyrannical. My
friends, on the Cth of next November the
world will behold In th.'s country a sublime
spectacle. It will gee a great army of men
go into the voting places to check this flood of
Imperialism. But the most sublime spectacle
the world will see will be In a Xew England
hamlet, an old man tottering to the polls and
saying. "My name is George S. Boutwell, and
I am for Bryan." The question may be gath
ered from the conduct of this grand old man.
Republicanism or imperialism, which will you
have? I am not Ignorant that every Repub
lican paper taunts and jeers at us for saying
this Is the issue. I am aware that every Re
publican speaker echoes the sentiment of the
party press. And so, my Democratic friends,
we are all hypocrites. We are all preaching
a doctrine of Fham and of fraud. If the ut
terances of Senator Fairbanks at Mechanics'
Pavilion were true, it Is strange that the Re
publicans in charge of the State campaign
did not avail themselves of the opportunity and
unmark us. In the early days of thin month

Fenator Fims called the meeting to order ;
and paid that in the speaker of the even-
Ing oratory existed in perfection. Senator
F'.mF spoke at some length and concluded
by introducing- R. Porter Ashe as chair
man of the evening. Mr. Afhe said:
"Nearly two years ago from this plat
form I predicted I would V><? elected Sen
ator from the Twenty-fourth District, and
your kindness prompts me to make a
prophecy that I will be elected this time.
If there ever was a time when loyalty to
the party is demanded it is now. It is in
evitable that in party affairs conflict will
firise and wounds be inflicted. But no
true Democrat should let those conflicts
or wounds prevent him from giving his
Fupport to the entire ticket. Is it true
that the party in San Francisco is dis
rupted by dissension? In my district I
have not met a single Democrat who is
rot Jn favor of the election of Mr. Bryan
nnd myself, t'ut I want to make a plea
for the election of the Legislative candi
dates, to Foe t.. it that the Republicans
do not gerrymander this State."

SMALL BOY WINS FOR DUDES
Oakland 7, Stockton 3.
The wicked small boy leaned over the
railing of the grand stand in the sixth
inning and called Mr. Harper, manager
and pitcher of the Millers. "Sapho." The
anti-Stocktonians In the "beer bleachers"
took it up. It rattled the Stockton man
ager. Then the Dudes hit him four times, :
scoring four runs. That small boy re
ceived several bags of peanuts from Cal
Ewing after the game was over, but he
kept many miles away from Mr. Harper,
who does not like to be called any such
pet names.
Borchers was on the flab for the Dude3
and he twirled such intricate ball that
the Millers found him but three times in
a full nine Innings. In the Bixth inning
they slammed the ball hard upon the turf
for two safe hits, but nothing in the way
of runs resulted until the next inning,
when three men scored on a single hit,
attended by gross errors and as evil base
throwing.
The second inning put Oakland on the
pcore board. Kelly, Ewing's latest find
for third base, rapped out a two-bagger,
reaching the third station on a passed ball
and scoring on some amateurish miscon
duct on the part of Harper and Catcher
Graham. The latter is Stockton's latest
as a receiver. His game yesterday was
not sun-bedimming.
As soon as they began to "Sapho"
Harper in the sixth inning Drennan
worked off a two-bagger on him, followed
by Hutchlnson, who got into the run
ning on a piece of fantastic Jugglery by
Courtney. Francks came into the play
with a hit and was soon joined by Arrel
lanes, who sent out a ball which the
Stockton pitcher coula not handle. Then
Â¦Borchers swung his bat and Harper went
up into the air. When the dead and
wounded were listed the bell was rung
four times, once each for Drennan.
Hutchlnson. Francks and Arrellanes.
The seventh meant something for
Stocktonâ three runs, which were obtained
! by the combination of a Miller hit and
Dude errors. McHale. Streib and Graham
did the score stunt for Stockton. Oak
land cinched the victory by adding two
runs in the eighth.

grand day at Tanforan Park. In
the athletic events that opened
the fair of the San Francisco and
Pan Mateo Agricultural Association tnreo
records were lowered, namely the pole
vault, the haJf-mile and the C2f>-yard dash.
The weather was warm and the trac+r
lijrhtnlng fast, which made it an ideal day
for smashing track records. In the after
noon the society people of San Mateo held
Bwuy. There were hurdle jumping events
for green hunters and parades of stylish
ponies, hacks and road horses.
In the jumping events Peter Parsons, a
younp society man recently arrived from
Ireland, carried off the honors by his skill
and d&ring horsemanship. Henry J-
Crocker took the prize for the best four
in-hand coach, and when the blue ribbon
was pinned on his leaders there was a
Ptorm of applause In the grand stand as
his turnout was faultless in every detail.
AJ1 through the afternoon the park pre
sented a gay appearance as society warm
ly applauded the results of the contests
from the tops of Its coaches and drags
that lined the inside of the speed track.

bird, apparently feeling the effect* of his
close morning game with Walter PÂ«.
Smith, played a wretched game for tho
first nine holes and diJ not get over hi*
nervousness until the game was almost
hopelessly; lost.
The sensation of thÂ« day was the defeat
of Walter B. Smith by Holablrd In the
Femi-flnals. Smith's machine-like work
Thursday and Friday had made him h
warm favorite for the honors of the
tournament, but in his game with thÂ»Â»
Glen View player he was sadly out of
form.

WHITEHEAD, the crack grey
hound of the Lopez kennels and
many-time stake winner, haa â¢
run his last course. The fast
â¢ black and white courser died
yesterday afternoon at Union Park,
despite every effort of his ti"ainer to savo
him. AVhitehead was entered in th*- open
stako and drawn against McComb's Pa
triot for the third course in the run-dow:i.
.Slipped to a strons hare the dogs were
given a run of more than two and a b<?!f
minutes, .with "Whitehead practically mak
ing it a single-handed go and winning by
a score of 17 to 7. The game hound wag
badly winded after his work and never
recovered.
Many times has Whitehead won harder
goes than tho one which proved his un
doing and has followed them up by land
ing a stake winner. While he was ad
mittedly a speedy dog he was pronounced
by many people a victim ofiung trouble,
and. his death is attributed to that cause.
It is likely, however, that his owner will
have an autopsy performed to satisfy
himself, on that point.
Tho strong hares furnished for the stake,
were a fast lot, and asÂ» a result nearly all
of the courses were lonpr ones. Whilo tho
favorites made a good showing, the short
enders which did land were at better than
average odds. The best of the day was
the win of Little Sister over Roval Union
at 10 to L
Reilly's dog took the turn by two
lengths, but was outworked by his oppo
nent. Our Maggie led Sky Blue and
broug-ht happiness to the pikers' camp,
winning- at 7 to 1. Silver Wings beat Erin
at 4 to 1. Bad Boy, in a long race, got the
flag from Rude Awakening at the same
odds. Cruiser added another to his list
of short-end victories, beating Honesty at
3 to 1.
Mac's Melody is In strong favor for tho
stako, with Sacramento Boy and Twin
City Girl close up. Royal Anne and Sara
are factors and stand well as outsiders.

Five relnsmen contributed still further
to the unpopularity of the harness Rame
by proceedings in the free-for-all pace,
which opened things. Goshen Jim ruled a
1 to 4 favorite for the first heat, finishing
second. Myrtha Whips, driven by Hell
man, won in straight heats. The alTa'r
was not worthy of description.
Undoubtedly the most surprising hap
pening of the day was the win of the
mile and a quarter run by Stromo, a 10 to
1 shot, backed to 6. Much, wise coin went
Into the books on the lumbering gelding,
and he ran over the top of tho pacemaker.
Kickumbob, the last furlong, Fcoring by a

ite, with Mounce up. ran a disgustingly
bad race. Owner Charles Boots bring ox
eeedingly wrathy over tho performance.
Mounce is traveling rapidly toward the
suspended list.
On Jingle Jingle, though a mare practi
cally unbacked for the seven-furlong
handicap, this same rider shone to much ;
advantage. With Good Hope and St. Cuth- \
bert fighting it out through tho stretch,
Mounce came with a well timed rush ]
astride Jingle, beating St. Cuthbert a half- ;
length. Formero. which opened favorite,
with top weight up, ran unplaced. Good
Hope tired the last sixteenth. j
After causing a tedious delay fit the
post, aided by one or two others of the
company. Panamint. the post favorite,
landed tho sixth event by a nose from So
cialist. Fauntleroy, with the mount on
the winner, put up a very strong finish.
Amasa opened favorite, but the delay
caused the, gelding's odds to recede to X
to 1. and/In the running he was killed off
by Lady Helols-e.
Tiburon, with tho ring laying 3 to n
about his chances, took tho final sprint
hands down from February and Midlove.

The second and last song recital of Miss
Anna Miller Wood was given yesterday
afternoon at Sherman & Clay Hall be
fore an appreciative and musical audi
ence. Miss Wood is a thorough artist, of
finished and classic style, without man
nerism of any kind, and with a clear, fine,
full voice of true contralto quality. Her
programmes are invariably well chosen
and her Interpretations sympathetic and
scholarly. Yesterday's list of songs in
cluded the picturesque "Divinites du
Sty*c" of Cluck, the rendering of which
was perhaps a shade lacking In dramatic
fire; some charming old Irish songs dell
ciously sung, and a fourteenth century
"Wiegenlied." its quaint, Gothic spirit ad
mirably suggested.
Among the moderns, Grieg. Brahms,
Goring Thomas and Foote were well rep
resented, the quintet of Foote songs being
especially interesting. Grieg's "Mother
Sorrow" and the Brahms "Vergebllches
Standchen" were differently attractive,
and the '.'Summer Night" of Goring
Thomas (given by request) has never re
ceived a more sympathetic rendering.
The accompaniments of Miss Olivia Ed
munds were notably good, distinguished
throughout by an admirable restraint,
delicate sympathy with song and singer
and a full technical capability.

Sergeant James Donovan's Division
Is the First One to Occupy the
New Quarters.
The new Hall of Justice was opened for
the police at noon yesterday. Sergeant
James Donovan's command was the first
to march out of the new quarters, having
been transferred from the California
street police station earlier in the morn
ing.
The new hall is not yet completed, and
the police facilities for a few days will
be limited. Even the telephone system
is not complete and the oflices have not
yet been fully furnished. No provision
has been made for prisoners and the pat
rol wagons conveyed their human freight
to the Harbor and the Central stations.
At noon the California-street police sta
tion presented a sorry sight. All the
lockers and cells had been torn down and
the equipment removed.
The electrical apparatus in the new hall
was connected with the fire alar.m sta
tion, and the police business, in this re
spect, was unhampered. The prison ele
vator and the cells in the new hall are not
yet ready for use. The calls were an
swered by the California-street station
wagon. Prisoners south of Bush street
were taken to Central station and those
north of Bush were conveyed to the Har
bor. Until the hall is completed these
arrangements will remain in effect. The
last prisoner booked at the , California
street station was Jim Hamilton, alias
"Scotty" Hamilton, who claimed he was
from East Oakland. The charge against
this prisoner was drunkenness.

Wound on Head.
Â¦ Â» Â¦
â¢ " S. Higahida, a Japanese boy 18 years of
age, -was found near Harrison and Sec
ond streets early this morning by Police
men Jordan and Ryan. The Japanese was
undressed and had an ugly wound in the
forehead. Nothing is known of how ho
Â¦was Injured, but the police believe he was
held up by thugs. The wound in the head
was produced either by a bullet or some
blunt implement. It is over the left eye
and Is quite deep.
Around tho waist of the youth was a
belt containing $8. The Japanese was
sent to the Harbor Hospital, where he
was treated by Doctors Robinson and
Bower. The physicians found that his
nkull was fractured, and say that his
recovery is doubtful. The injured man
muttered a few words In Japanese when
he was first found, but soon lapsed into
unconsciousness.
The youth's vest and trousers were
found under the bridge. The legs of the
latter garment had been ripped up thÂ«
sides and his vest torn into three pieces.
Both were covered with blood and dirt.
It is the theory of the police that thug"
either struck or shot the Japanese and
then searched his person ror valuables.
Nothing but a collar-button was found In
his pocket.

For hours before the barricaded doors

with mouths watering and eyes popping

When Staff Captain Crawford gave the
word, there was a delude of small hu

hallelujah lads and lassiea off their feet.
Then it was to pile en masse upon the
loads of rich fruit that burdened the rows
of tables. For an hour the throng of
youngsters were regaled, and there wasn't
as much as a grape seed left to tell the
story. Every little guest of the army was
sent away laden within and without,' and
smiling: though besmeared faces were the
evidences of contented fullness.

Eddie Foy has many warm admirers In
this city, and In years past has contribut
ed more to laughter than any other come
dian that has appeared here. As a mem
ber of the American Extravaganza Com
pany he was always a welcome visitor,
and it la a well-known fact. that he was
the principal drawing factor of that gi
gantic organization. His engagement at
the Columbia Theater, beginning to-night,
in tho newest farce comedy success. "A
Night in Tpwn." and as a star at the head
of his own company. Is an event that Is
looked forward to with much pleasure by
theater-goers. His bubbling humor and
eccentric comedy have given him a tre
mendous hold on the risibilities of his
audiences, and If the part In which he Is
to appear is half as good as Is promised
he will no doubt make the hit of his
career during his coming engagement. He
will be supported by a strong- company
of players, Including Eva Tanguay, who
Is well known as one of the cleverest of
soubrettes. Eddie Foy will be seen In a
character entirely new to the stage. Tha
name of the role is David Scarum. Dur
ing the progress of the piece Foy appears
In various characters which he is made
to assume, each of which affords him
splendid opportunities for the display of
his versatile talents as a comedian.

The Nusbaumer faction of the Repub
lican County Committee has deferred Its
meeting for organization until an official
communication shall be received from the
Republican State. Central Committee con
cerning the status of the split County
Committee before the State organization.
Such a communication in writing, It is
stated, will be forthcoming early next
week. It Is announced by members of the
opposition to the Breed wing that the
State Committee will officially decline to
recognize either of the committees, a con
dition which State Central Commltteeman
E. K. Taylor said now existed.
The Breed men vehemently declare that
they have no information that would lead
them to believe that the State Committee
does not Intend to recognize them. But
be that as it may, they are going ahead
with arrangements for a Republican mass
meeting next Saturday night, at which
Senator Perkins will be the chief speaker
upon national topics. It is also believed
that a number of the local Republican
candidates will take part in the mass
meeting.
So far as the split in tho County Com
mittee is concerned the Republicans of
Alameda County are undoubtedly desirous
of pence there. The issue between tha
factions has, however, no application to
the present campaign. It la purely pre
liminary to the contest which is expected
two years from now, when the State and
county fights will attract the attention of
the politicians. The campaign so far os
this county Is concerned will be largely a
district affair, as the candidates outside
of the Superior Judges are district nomi
nees.
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf has
opened headquarters for tho campaign at
1004 Broadway. The Congressional com-,
mlttee will have charge of all of the
work In the Third District. Congressman
Metcalf has been requested to be a
speaker at next Saturday night's meeting.
"William R. Davis, the Republican Elec
tor from the Third Congressional District,
will deliver an address on Sunday evening
at the Unitarian church before the Twen
tieth Century Club, his topic being "The
Moral Claims of the Republican Party."

Her complaint to her mother on Thurs
day that she feared the return of her
physical troubles of a year ago had no
significance till her death and the sus
picions of suicide arose. Then for the
first time the family realized how serious
ly this physical ailment had affected the
pfirl. This is the only explanation which
they can offer for her deed, and even now
they feel that she drank the poison
through mistake.
Miss Macdonald had "been an ambitious
Ftudent. but her health was not equal to
the task, and she was compelled to re
tire from the High School before she had
completed her course. She fretted con
elderably upon this subject, but never a
suggestion that she would end her life
was offered. She had Bald life was of lit
tle arcount to her, but this remark was
not taken seriously by those who heard It.
The parents and brothers of the young
â¢woman are almost beside themselves with
prief and perplexity over the unaccounta
ble deed. Only a few minutes before she
retired to her bedroom Miss Macdonald
â¢was in apparently most jovial spirits.
There were several callers at the house
whom she had been entertaining and
there was nothing in her conduct to indi
cate that she contemplated self-destruc
tion.
The vial was not empty, but sufficient of
the deadly fluid was gone to indicate that
the despondent girl had taken a large
enough draught to caus<Â» death speedily.
All doubt concerning the cause of Al
berta Macdonald'P tragic death was re
moved to-day by the post-mortem exami
nation hold by Dr. J. M. Shannon and Dr.
C. M. Selfridge. That the young woman
died from carbolic acid poisoning was
Ehown beyond question. The bottle which
had contained the poison was found to
day in the yard at the Macdonald resi
dence on Chicago avenue, directly be
neath the window of the bedroom where
the girl lay down to die. .

feldt, has recently achieved a remark
able success in the East. She has been
concertlzlng In Saratoga. Newport and a
number, of other : prominent watering
places and has received the most flatter
ins aress notices. At one concert sho
The farewell concert of the little pian
ists, Paloma and Karla Schramm, on last
Tuesday evening, was a very successful
affair. Eight-year-old Karla made her
Fecond programme appearance with the
Field "Nocturne" (No. 2) and the Durand
"Concert Valse" In A flat. The little girl
bids fair to become a worthy rival of her
clever sister, her touch, tone and inter
pretations being amusingly like those of
her tiny teacher so far. She has not yet
developed any special faculty for Im
provisation, that power which so distin
guishes Paloma from the average child
wonder, . nut Â¦- that she haa " an almost
equally, remarkable musical gift Is quite
evident. They will shortly leave San
Francisco for a northern tour, and will
then, it Is understood, concertlzo for a
season In the East.
The subscription list for the symphony
concert to be given at the Tlvoll Opera
house on Thursday aftprnoon. October 23,
is climbing up In satisfactory fashion.
The "Symphonle Kantastique." which has
never before been given In San Francisco,
was studied by Mr. Hlrschfeid under the
distinguished conductor of the Boston
symphony concerts. Emil Paur, which,
with Mr. Hlrschfeld's ability, is certain
warrant for a scholarly rendering. A set
of steel chimes to be used in this Berlioz
production Is now In process of construc
tion.
To limit th<Â» unavailing regret of the
Lueias that might have been I may say
that I Judge it strictly within the proba"
bilitles that the Azzall singers would havo
declined to perform with. any substitute
that could have been secured! even Melba
herself!
Then libraries were scoured, old opera
singers appealed to, second-hand stores
searched, conductors implored and at last
a lono copy of "Lucia" was discovered.
Joyfully bearing his prize the fortunate
discoverer hurried to the distracted Az
zali, and the two hastened to Implore the
prlma donna lyric soprano of the com
pany to consent to appear in the opera on
Wednesday evening. The lady speaks no
Kngllsh. the manasrer no Italian, and a
lively colloquy through the medium of an
Interpreter was carried on. But Angelina
Turconl-Bruni was illâ it is the Immemo
rial privilege of the prima donna to be
ill nt the most effective and awkward
juncture â and she said "impossible" In all
the varied tonrs of her delightful lan
guage and voice. But at last, about mid
night, and in scant time for a change in
tho following day's advertisements, she
consented to undertake the role, which. In
truth, was generously done, as she was
veritably suffering from a severe cold.
And on Wednesday morning, accordingly,
a full rehearsal of "Lucia." without the
principal, took place, golnsr off splendidly.
Then came th<* earlv afternoon's an
nouncement of the still more serious in
disposition of the artist, and the manage
ment was at Its wits' end Indeed.
Could any one be induced to substitute?
Barbaresehl is a dramatic soprano and
the role Is not In her reportoire. Who In
all San Francisco could sing the part,
even with the book, not to disappoint
again nn expectant audience?
Then began another struggle, nnd the
California's wires were kept hot with in
quiries in nil directions. One prominent
teaehfr Innocently suggested an appeal to
Rt>petto. the TlvoH's lyrlo soprano. Rose
Adler. whose repertoire includes the role,
was offorod any compensation "she chos?
to ask If she would undertake it. but she
has not sung It of late and refused. Mme.
Billonl-ZifTerer. who*<e "I.ucia" war. at h*Â»r
finger's end a few years ago. telephoned
from San Rafael that she also was out of
practice in the part, nnd none of the
prominent teachers could furnish a pupil
who could be counted upon oven to at
tempt the task. The rest of the story is
known, but so was lost an opportunity for
distinction and a financial opportunity
that seldom occurs in the far West. It is
on just such haphazard occasions that
most of the great singers have made their
first appearances in instances innumer
able, and It seems rather remarkable that

a rival organization was out of the ques

the musicians dispersed, completely at

programme. This, be it remembered, the

A correspondent writes to the Los Ange
les Herald concerning the Coallnga field,
that there are about eighty wells produc
ing and drilling in that section. Twenty
one strings of tools are going and a num
ber of rigs are upâ a birdseye view of the
field resembles in some respects the Whit
tler district and looks like an ideal oil
region. Huge Iron storage tanks, pipe
lines and a strong smell of fresh gas
everywhere impress one with the idea
that the name Oil City is very appro
priate. The Union Oil Company, under
the name of the Pioneer Pipe 'Line Com
pany, has . a 35.000-barrel storage tank
near the wells, from' which the oil Is run
to the railroad, a distance of ten miles,
through a three-inch pipe line, from
which point it is shipped to San Francisco,
the principal market. Another 35,000
barrel tank Is being built, from which
will run a four-Inch pipe line to the rail
road for transporting the heavier .' oil.
which is also found there. The pipe lino
Is constructed at present to within five
miles of the tank.
made. '
Several new wells have been started In
the "Whittler field. . What the Los Ange
lenos style the 'northwest extension is
said to be making good progress.
Revenue Officer Thomas has been visit
ing the oil fields In the south, calling upon
the brokers to demand a penalty of $25 for
failure to comply with the law. The
Bakersfield Callfornian says the brokers
comply gracefully and promptly, but that
there are companies that have appointed
stockholders as agents who will be fined.
Two officers will be stationed in the field
to eee whether the Government is getting
all the revenue from tho oil companies to
which it is entitled.
The Standard Oil Company has decided
to provide tankage for half a million gal
lons of oil in the Kern River district, and
will direct that provision be made at once.
The company has under consideration pro
vision for the nearby districts.
The developments recently in the oil In
dustry in the San Joaquin Valley have
been large and important. There was a
little whiff of wind that blew down a
number of derricks in the Temblor dis
trict a few days ago, but that is only a
minor Interference and the progress
toward the development of the resources
in petroleum of the valley over a large
area is steady and satisfactory. The Wil-
Us Canyon spur of railway in the Kern
River district is ready for use, all the
sU-el rails having been laid, but there is
a shortage of cars, which will soon bi
remedied. Contracts will be Jllled easier
than heretofore and tho entire business
of tho district will be stimulated. Tho
story of developmrnt is true of all sec
tions where operations have begun on
varying scales of activity. There is a
race at San Pedro among the owners of
wells to get down to tho oil first. Four
companies started to drill about the same
time and all expect to lind oil at about
the same depth. The Bakersfield Eoh-j
says that rathfy slow progress is report
ed from the Foso Creek country. One
obstacle after another has bobbed up to
delay operations, and the question of oil
or no oil In that locality still remains, un
settled. The New Hope on 20, 27, 27. is
down 1000 feet, but the crow is now at
work fishing for a sand pump. The Crnck
ers and tne Defiance are also experienc
ing some delays of a similar nature, but
hope to have smoother calling shortly.
The Commonwealth has placed a fine rig
on 32, 26. 28. and Is about ready to dro^
the drill. The derrick that was erected
on S, 27, 27, was blown away and no
further attempt at development has been
"There is an immense area in the State
which contains rocks and shales more or
less saturated with bitumen, as well aa
nuineious springs from which moro or
less petroleum nnds it way to the sur
face. Along the line of tne Coast Kange,
With its numerous diverging ranges, turjfe
areas are founu where tne strata have
been more or loss folded, but not changed
by heat, bringing about the favoraole
conditions for the accumulation of pe
umeum. Tne development of lhJW of most
importance wars tnat found in Kern
County, ten nilies north of Bakerslleld.
There were other new developments dis
covered to the south and west of Bakers
nelrt. This county added 13.000 barrels to
the output of the State In 1809, as com
pared wltn lu.OW barrels in 1S9S, nothing
oeing credited in 1S07. Fresno County
produced 4o;<,372 barrels In 1S90, as com
pared with 15<>.0C0 barrels In 189S, or nearly
three times the quantity. Nearly all the
petroleum produced in California is dark
in color ana heavy in quantity. The great
bulk of the product comes from Los An
geles County. The heavy petroleum ranges
from 12 to 1 18 degrees B. That produced
In Fresno County is light In color and
most of it is as light as 31 degrees 13. in
gravity."
Mineral locators of lands in the more
important oil belts of the State have,
since the decision of last Monday, ren
dered bv Judge Ropb 'n the Federal Court
at lÂ»s "Angeles, been more hopeful thai
the "scrlppers" will be finally routed.
First the Government snarled up affairs
by the decisions making' it obligatory to
actually produce oil to demonstrate the
mineral character of the land. Then the
"scrippers" began to do a. land office
business, even putting agricultural claims
upon land from which oil had been taken.
Scrip was sold at the rate of $5 per acre
to any purchaser by brokers in this city
and elsewhere in California. Prominent
attorneys for the Southern Pacific Com
pany were mixed up In the transacations.
The fight of the mineral claimants to re
tain their holdings is not at an end by any
means and it is evident that novel legal
developments are ahead. So many millions
of money are actually invested and so
many millions may be taken out in oil
values from tho lands in question that the
fight will be bitter. Notice has been Riven
at Los Angeles that the case decided by
Judge Ross last Saturday will be taken to
tho United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals. This is the first step in the con
tinuance of a contest which bids fair to
be historic in the annals of jurisprudence.
Mr. Oliphant describes the general con
ditions attending the oil discoveries as
follows:
"The production of crude petroleum in
California in 1S09," says Mr. Oliphant,
"was valued at J2,50S,751, about 95 cents a
barrel. As compared with 1808 there was
an Increase of 3S4.8S8 barrels In production
and 10 cents in average price per barrel.
Los Angeles County, which takes first
rank in the amount of production, pro
duced 1.39S.G90 barrels, valued at 05.3 cents
a barrel. Of the total quantity produced
in Los Angeles County 1,032,^06 barrels,
valued at $'.560,726. or 93 cents a barrel,
were produced in Los Angeles City. The
other counties of California which pro
duced petroleum, ranged according to
their output, were: Ventura, 496,200 bar
rels; Fresno, 43y,372 barrels,; Santa Bar
bara, 208,370; Orange, 108,1)77; Kern, 15,000,
and Santa Barbara, 1500."
That part of the report of the United
States Geological Survey that deals with
the petroleum industry of the country,
which Is Just out from the press, con
tains some very interesting statements.
California is found to be the fifth in rank
of oil producing States In the total amount
of production, taking the output of 189D
iis the basis of computation. Outside of
what Is known as the Eastern field, which
Includes Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Vir
ginia and the adjacent States, the total
production of oil last year was 3.7&5.416
barrels, of which California produced
2,642,055, or 70 per cent of the whole. There
are thirteen States in which petroleum
has been found.,, F. H. Oliphant of Penn
sylvania wrote the oil part of the report.

at its meeting on the 22d inst. had a good
attendance. During the evening there
was presented to the officers and memr
bers a statement by each delegate "and
district deputy of the condition of thÂ«
lodges in the city, a feature that was very
interesting. A list of visitations to

The Eschscholtzias.
The eighth party given by that' very se
lect organization of the Mission district,
the Eschscholtzias. in Mission Parlor Hall
last Thursday night was one of the social
successes of the season. There was an at

gant costumes and the gentlemen attired
in conventional evening dress made up a
pretty scene during the grand march and
the subsequent numbers on the decidedly
well arranged programme of dances.- The
Eschscholtzias are growing in favor, and
the fact that those who are invited are
carefully selected from the list of names

birth of W. H. Barnes and the forty-fifth

A dav or two before the grand ball of
celebration week a thousand Invitations
were left at the office of the grand secre
tary" with the request of the ball commit
tee that they be deliveied to the local par
lors and their members. It was an Im
possibility to do so In the limited time,
consequently many did not receive invi
tations, and now there Is complaint that
the grand secretary's office did not send
them out. An investigation proves that
the secretary's office only received the
tickets for any one who would call for
them but made no promise to distribute
them' in any other manner. If any one is
to blame it is the ball committee, which
did not look after the Native Daughters
named were guests at the
Native Daughters' Home durinp celebra

WATER ON FIREâ S. W.. City. Fire
can always be extinguished by reducing
the temperature of tho combustible mat
ter to a point below that at which a flame
becomes possible or by shutting oft all air
from the flame, as combustion is not pos
sible except with the help of the oxygen
which atmospheric air contains. The ap
plication of water to a burning substance
induces both these conditions opposed to
combustion. The water on coming in con
tact with the burning substance is in
stantly vaporized and that is converted
into steam. This vaporization takes away
the heat of the burning matter until It is
reduced to a point when flame is no
longer possible. At the same time the
volume, of steam formed shuts oft the
surrounding atmosphere from the flre and
hastens the reduction of temperature.
Thus the flre is stifled and cooled until
there is nothing left of it.
NORTHWEST PASSAGEâ A. A. T.,
Grimes, Colusa County, Cal. No vessel
has ever passed from the Atlantic to the
Pacific or from the Pacific to the Atlantic
through the Arctic Ocean. In 1S52 Sir
Robert J. LeM. McClure discovered the
northwest passage from the Pacific to
the Atlantic, but he was forced to aban
don his vessel, the Investigator, crossed
over the ice to a point where he met
Lieutenant Pirn of the Resolute, and on
that vessel, which was at Dealy Island,
he returned to England in September, 1854.
CRYOLITEâ Subscriber, City. Cryolite
Is a snow-white metal, partially trans
parent, of viterous luster and of brittle
texture. It is so named from Its fusi
bility in the flame of a candle. It U a
compound of sodium, fluorine and alumi
num, and .is used 'for the preparation of
the metal aluminum. It occurs In veins
in gneiss with pyrites and galena, and has
been found in Western Greenland and
Miyask in the Ural. In the United States
it is used in the manufacture of a white
porcelain glass; also in the preparation
of caustic soda.
IVORY KEYSâ I., "West Point, Cal.
There are several ways to restore the
color of Ivory keys of an organ that have
become discolored, but the work has to be
done by a professional. An amateur who
would attempt to restore them would
either destroy the ivory or ruin the In
strument. If the keys are celluloid, the
cheapest way to restore them is to have
the old ones removed and new layers of
celluloid put on.
AGE OF TREES â R., Valambrossa, Cal.
It is generally accepted that the age of a
tree may be told by the number of layers
that may be counted en a transverse cut
of the tree. This, however, is not an ab
solute test and is often the source of mis
takes. In some instances by interruption
to growth several layers can be formed in
one year and lead to an erroneous esti
mate.
GROUNDS FOR DIVORCEâ J. J., City.
The grounds on which dlvocces are
granted in California are: Adultery, ex
treme cruelty, willful desertion, willful
neglect, habitual intemperance and con
viction for felony. Insanity is not one of
the grounds laid down in the code as a
ground for divorce.
NOTE AND MORTGAGEâ W. A. B..
City. If a man borrows money on a piece
of property and gives his note as well as
a mortgage the mortgage does not hold

renewal.

AT GRAVESEND
Not One of Them Manages to
Get First Under 'the
Wire.
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â It was a char
acteristic getaway day at tne Gravesend
Racetrack to-day. Not a single favorite
waa first to the wire, one after another
going down in startling succession. The
weather was dull and cloudy, but no rain
fell and as a good card waa offered a
biff half-holiday crowd was on hand to
see the curtain rung down on the fall
meeting of the Brooklyn Jockey Club.
The feature of the day was Jockey
Henry's clever work. He rode three win
ners and one place horse, and as it hap
pened in each case for S. O. Ilildreth.
Hls followers reaped a narvest. Two
stakes were decided, the Oriental and
Prospect handicaps. Imp was scratched
from the Oriental and Jack Point was
then made a hot favorite with Gonfalon
.next In demand. Charentus, the outsider
in the betting, upset calculations. Well
handled by Burns he made all the run
ning and won easily from Gonfalon, who
closed fast after dropping out of It on
the far turn and beat Jack Point for th*
place. Beau Gallant won tha Prospect
handicap largely through Henry's riding.
Ho was slow to begin, getting away next
to last, but gradually improved nls posi
tion and at the end won cleverly from
Water Color, who made most of the run
ning. Autolight was third. It was not a
true run race as far as Blues and Dublin,
were concerned. The former was prac
tically left at the post and then finished
fourth and Dublin was crowded out of It
on the far turn when running with tha
leaders. Summary:

Handicapper a Mud I>ark-
CHICAGO, Sept. 29.â Four horses fell in
a bunch at the eleventh jump in Haw
thorne's steeplechase to-day, seriously In
juring: Jockey Eggerson and slightly
wounding W. J. Johnson. There wera
eight starters in the race and although
It waa over the full course, the field was
closely bunched at the eleventh Jump, when
High Admiral fell. Sallust. Zufallg and
Becky Rolfe all stumbled over him and
the horses and Jockeys were mixed up In
endless confusion. Kg&ersori, who had
the mount on Zufallg axi<? "W. Johnson on
High Admiral lay as if dead. C. Johnson
on Sallust was only slightly Injured and
was able to walk away. Eggerson and
Johnson were carried to the Jockeys"
dressing- room. Johnson soon recovered,
a*nd although badly bruised, had no ser
ious Injuries. Eggerson waa unconscious
for nearly an hour and seemed In great
agony. Physicians said there might bo
Internal injuries, but anticipated no ser
ious results. After the fall Coronatus,
who was leading, had but little trouble
in disposing of his field. Mr. Dunlap beat
Donation five lengths for the place. Mis
fortune befell Iconl in the second race
after he had been backed from 10 to 1
down to 5 at post time. The colt bled
after reaching the quarter pole and had to
be pulled up to a walk. The accident
probably prevented a big killing. "Weather

Magee's Real Estate Circular says:
"There Is a difference of from 10 to 25
per cent between what owners ask and
prospective buyers are willing to pay.
This gap will be closed, fully bridged, aft
er the election. The 16 to 1 business has a
very retarding effect upon real estate
sales. If that policy should prevail the
value of a dollar will be a \ fluctuating
quantity, and, when the value of money
is uncertain, everything else is sure to be,
and then money owners begin to hoard
and cease buying. We aro not making
this remark in a political sense at all, but
simply expressing a real estate belief
which the past history of this subject
justifies us in expressing."

CLOSING.
The market here was lethargic and dull all
round to-day. There was practically no tension
because of the monetary and political appre
hensions which prevail. Americans were fea
tureless. Prices were lower, following the New
York lead, though the quotations generally
were above parity. Money was easier to-day.
Silver was steady but quieter.
NEW YORK. Sept. 29. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
London Market.
NEW TOHK, Sept. 29.â The Financier says:
The heavy decrease in deposits reported by the
New York banks, amounting to $12,724,703 for
the week ending September 29, operated to
reduce legal reserve requirements by $3,000,000
and over and thus counteracted by half the
loss of $S,8O0,800 in cash which went out of
banks to meet Interior demands. The position
of the banks as a whole Is little better than
indicated by the statement for the reason that
receipts of nearly $2,500,000 of specie from the
Pacific Coast Friday figure only slightly In
the. weekly compilation. The loan contraction
of $3,668, 400 was due to the efforts of banks
to meet the demands of Interior correspond
ents and at the same time to maintain their
respective percentages at the required legal
point. The reduction in ' loans lessened de
posits, and with the heavy loss in cash,
brought about the shrinkage of $12,764,700 in
the deposit total, with the effect already noted.
The deposit shrinkage at this season is not
unusual. Last year during the week ending
September 23, the banks lost nearly $20,000,000
of deposits, and the decrease for the current
week a year ago was $13,000,000. At the close
of September, 1S99, however, the banks hold
only $1,724,450 of excess reserve, as against $12.'
942,600 now, and they lost at least $65,000,000
of deposits In September, 1899, compared with
only $13,780,000 this month. The drain la. there
fore easier to meet this year than last, but it
means higher money rates from now on. The
current statement is oompljcated by the opera
tions of one or two large banks, the decrease
of which go far toward changing the totals.
Last week $^000,000 or D6 per cent of the ex
cess reserve of all the banks was held by ono
institution. This week the same bank holds
J5.727.40O, or 44 per cent of all the reserve, but
its own loss In cash amounts to $5,207,000, or
within $1,500,000 of the total loss in cash by all
the banks. The position of the. remaining.in
stitutions, therefore, has undergone no impor
tant change so far as cash is concerned during
the weÂ«k. _ .

The excessive speculative Inflation of last
fall hag no parallel In this market. But the
consensus of opinion among bankers points to
an active money market later In the season,
and this prospect .enjoins caution in . specula
tive commitments. Bankers avow their In
tention to give first attention to the needs of
their business customers and they expect time
money to loan at 6 per cent. Time loans now
maturing are put into call loans to be readily
available, which gives en illusory ease to the
call money market. The bankers argue that
much business held In abeyance until after
election will make' an active demand for money
at that time. It is clear also that the interior
demand for money Ib rather below the normal
than above It, as had been expected. This Is
due to the higher prices of cotton and grains,
making necessary large sums of money to ef
fect the marketing of crops.
which thÂ« bear account ha4 attained made it
vulnerable to attack, and when the probability
became known of a settlemrnt of the anthracite
coal miners' strike, thers was a powerful and
influential combination of speculators. ready to
take quick advantage of it and help the upturn
acainst the bears by every manipulative device
known to the professional.
The ready rout of the boars served to detract
much from the prestige of that party, as it
Indicated a lack of confidence in their position
not calculated to Invite a large following.
Manipulation of the stock loan department of
the exchange played a powerful part in the
Â¦week's campaign by the bulls, and stocks
which hax-e been abundant in the loan depart
ment on advantageous .erms were called in on
a large scale, thu* compelling the shorts to buy
the stocks to cover their contracts. Tens of
thousands of shares of ttock were bought in
for this purpose, the bulls bidding up prices
vigorously in competitiin with the distressed
ehorts and adding materiality to their dlffl
cultles. The elimination of so large a short In
terest has weakened the technical position of
the market to a material extent. The money
outlook has been lost sUht of largely during
the week, but still remains the dominant factor
in the stock market outlook. The downward
plunge in sterling exchange rates under tha
large â¢fferings of bills against .cotton and grain
exports has given - rise to renewed conjecture
regarding the . possibility cf gold Imports, but
the London and Continental discount rates
have- risen promptly In response, showing that
a movement of gold to New York would be re
sisted. News on Friday of a shipment of
$4,000,000 in gold from Australia to San Fran
cisco suggested a source of additional relief
for the money market. i

CITIZENS OF ASNTTERO
As there was no encampment of the Na
tional Guard of California during the cur
rent year the money that was appro
priated for that purpose is still in the
fund, and unless it is used before the last
day of next July it will revert to the gen
eral fund of the Stale. It is said now
that in order to make use of that appro
priation a camp, cr several camps, will be
ordered for next June. It is not yet de
cided if there will be a division camp or
three brigade camps.
There will soon be an election for colonel
of the First Regiment of Infantry to suc
cted the late Colonel Duboce. whose
death occurred a few weeks ago. Lieu
tenant Colonel Thomas F. O'Neil and
Charles Boxton. who was a major in the
old First and returned to this city ad lieu
l tenant colonel of the First California Vol
unteers, are the candidates for the posi
tion. At the time when O'Neil was in line
of promotion Uoxtcn was put forward as
a candidate. It is the old fight between
the companies In the Ellis street armory
and those of the Page street armory. As
the matter stands now it is asJcrted that
the officers of the Page street armory are
nearly solid for O'Neil. and if that is the
case he will be the next colonel. Should
that be the outcome there will be a va
cancy in the lieutenant colonelcy, and as
the promotion will be from the majors in
the regiment that will create one vacancy
for major. In the event of that contin
gency Lieutenant Harry F. McGurren
will be put forward as a candidate for
that position. It is probable that Major
Connelly will be elected lieutenant colonel
if O'Neil is promoted.
There is a peculiar condition of affairs in
Company M of the First Regiment. In
February last Thomas F. O'Neil was
elected captain of the company, W. L.
Wall was elected first lieutenant and
Richard Cailopy second lieutenant of the
company. In due time O'Neil and Cailopy
each received his* commission, but there
was not any for Wall. Several excuses
were offered for the non-appearance of
Wall's commission, one being that illness
in the family of the commander in chief
prevented him from attending to such
matters; then the excuse was that the
commander in chief was in the East. On
July 10 last O'Neil was elected lieutenant
colonel of the First and Wall was elected
captain. Cailopy first lieutenant and Ser
geant F. W. Newbert second lieutenant of
Company M. Since then Cailopy has re
ceived his commission, but neither Wall
nor Newbert have received theirs, and in
a communication relative to official busi
ness th<> office at Sacramento announced
that Cailopy alone was recognized. A day
or two since documents intended for the
company were sent to the home of Cailopy
from the Sacramento office, directed "Lieu
tenant Cailopy. commanding Company
M." Wall by virtue of his election has
been performing the duties of captain and
Is so recognized by the men. while the
Sacramento office recognizes Cailopy as
commander. Wall has passed a satisfac
tory examination before the board as to
his qualifications as first lieutenant, alfo as
captain. He- holds a responsible position
in the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
and so far as is known to the members of
the company or to the officers of the regi
ment there is nothing against his charac
ter as a. soldier or as a citizen. The com
pany is very anxious to know who is the
commanding officer and why commissions
have been withheld from a man who has
twice been elected by them. The only rea
son, if the party is qualified, that the com
mander in chief can offer for withholding
his signature from a commission is that
"in his opinion the person elected is un
worthy to be an officer In the National
Guard." No such opinion has been ex
pressed to show that Wall is unworthy to
be an officer of the National Guard
There has been much inquiry of late as to
the time when the several companies of
the guard are to be inspected, in accord
ance with the law that there shall be an
inspection once a year. Although the office
of the adjutant general at Sacramento has
1 been communicated with several times on
this subject no response has been re
ceived. These Inspections are usually held
In June of each year.
By regimental orders No. 12 of the Fifth
Infantry seven men have been discharged
from the service on account of removal,
one at the expiration of the term of ser
vice and one for the good of the service.
In the same regiment Corporal S. C. B.
King has been promoted sergeant of Com
pany A. and Privates P. G. Betts and
Don A. Valentine have been advanced to
corporals of the same company. George
W. Mclver has been promoted from cor
poral to sergeant of Company I. and Pri
vate W. P. Thorn has been appointed a
