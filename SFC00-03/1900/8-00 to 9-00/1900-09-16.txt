TOO MUCH
{Tricks of Â£arn-Stcrmers.
"One of the -old slang phrases of the
stage," -said Muggles, who used to be a
good actor, "was 1 to 'pong.' This means.
or used to mean, ushag-your own language
âthat is,' playing a part without cues of
the proper lines, relying only upon a
knowledge of the play to carry you
through. Tears ago on the road there
used to be some highly ludicrous situa
tions In consequence of a new play being
produced in a hurry. The stage manager,
however, had a wonderful genius for
patching up a hitch. When circumstances
were necessary he would lower a front
scene and tell the low comedian and
chambermaid to go on and 'keep it up.*
and while they did so he would arrange
bow the play had to be continued.
"Of coarse, actors are supposed to help
one another out of a difficulty, but at
times old grudges were paid off. For in
1 stance. I remember on one occasion a let
! ter had to be read In one scene. Unfortu
nately.this letter could not be found, so a
'dummy*â that is, a blank sheetâ was sent
on the stage.
; " 'Say. dad,' said the actor who had to
read a letter, and seeing it Wank, 'here's
a letter for you. You had better read It
yourself, as I am sure it contains good
new*.'
"But 'dad' tumbled to the occasion and
replied: 'No, Tom. you read it. Here,
Nelly, yoa read it.*
"The unsuspecting Nelly takes the let
ter and, seeing It blank, says: "No, father
had better read it. He will be able to
make it out better. Â¦ I'll go and fetch your
spectacles. Iknow where they are.' And
off fche goes. *
"The old man is again equal to the,oc
casion and calls out to her: 'Never mind
bringing them. Nelly; I'M come and get
them.' Then he walks off, and the stage
manager has to rearrange the scene.

Diplomacy in the affairs of a nation U
nothing more than an extension of tact
In social life. One day last week a giant
of a colored man took a load of coal to
a residence on the Cass farm. He was
cross and ugly and the good wife who
was looking a/ter things at home wanted
much at his hands. He had told her
that he had three tons to throw off the
wagon, had sworn roundly because the
Eliding door to the barn was hard to open,
and he was In open tebelllon when she
asked him to make a bin In the corner so
that the coal would not scatter all over
the floor.
"\V~hat you take me fo\ woman? You
am jes 1 like de boss at de yahd. He done
'elude Ah'm a hoss, a steam injin' an' a
tug. Ah do mo* wo'k dan all of 'em put

Ah'm a coal heabah. Ah is. Dat load goes
right heah In deccnta' of de floali and ef
any man comes 'round heah sayin' bin to
me Ah'll flah him frough de roof."
Not a word back did this little woman
say. She went to the house, took the half
of a luscious watermelon from the Ice
box, carried it to the barn and said:
"Here. Nick, is some Ice-cold melon and
here's a big silver spoon. Eat It all. for
vre have more than we need. It may cool
your throat. I do pity" any one who has
to work so hard this weather. Sorrv I
spoke about the bin. but 1 didn't know
where to get a man."
Niclc*a eyes glistened. He tackled the
melon before he did the coal, and he ate
by the cubic foot. He built the bin. He
nailed up a loose window sash and he
ewept the barn floor. When he returned
the spoon to the maid at the back door
he had his hat In his hand, while he said:
"Please gib my 'pa ids to de missus.

An interesting. game cf marbles
was In progress. One cf the play
ers in his anxiety to cisplco.; some crys
tals that rested in the "fat," or oval, had
moved his grimy fist barely an inch
toward the mark v:heii his sharp eyed
companion caught him in the act. _1hoii
followed the usual shrill argument on
cheating. Charges and denials were hurl
ed with a rapidity that was dtar'Jing. The
game having- been renewed, one of the
little fellows plumped himself on the side
walk and taking careful aim at the mar
bles in the ring launched his "taw," or
agate, and it struck one of them, knock-
Ing Jt out of the oval. T'nfortunatfcly lor
him the "taw" spun rapidly from the
force of the impact and remained in the
"fat," losing him the grame. He took his
loss philosophically and having exhauste-1
his supply of marbles he left his victor
ious companion and went in search of
other entertainment.
The Anrfrican boy is never at a loss for
eport. He dreams of his play while lis
tening to the droning voice of his teacher
in school. â¢ Often when he should be study
ing his geography he writes out a chal
lenge to bis neighbor for a game of ball
after school or thinks of the big kite he
expects to launch on the next windy day.
He gazes longingly at the clock, and as
the hands slowly creep round to 2:30 p. m.
he gives a welcoming grin and with high
spirits marches out of the school building.
Once on the street he makes a wild
scramble for home. He will stop on th-j
Â¦way to tease -a "Boxer," play tag or
â¢watch two school mates settle a dispute
with their fists. >
With a yell that would do credit to a
Cor m nche Indian he enters his abode and
with a lusty swing deposits his books in
a corner to be picked up later by his
fond parent. A piece of bread and jelly
or a nice big apple satislles his appetite
and he sneaks out the back door to avoid
being sent on an errand. He picks up his
bat and chases down to MJke Smith's
house and invites that youngster to get
his 1 ball and play "one o' cat." Other
"kids" see the inception of the game from
afar and they- join their companions with

memory. The following day. he will be
â¢eeti eniraF"J In an attempt to knocK a
Llotk cf wood out of business.
Shinny has more charm for the small
boy than eolf has for his elders. The
reason for his devotion to the former gar.ie
Is because of the excitement and dan
ger.' He has no "brassies," "putters, !
-kniblicks" or other fancy turned sticks.
All he needs is a stout branch of a tree,
which has a slight curve in it, A game
of shinny is soon started and quickly de
cided. The boys take sides and, as in a
W me of football, each -team strives to
force the block of wood toward their re
spective goals. The captains on each
team face each other and yell "shinny,
one shinny two, shinny three."
Before the word "three" i? uttered
both captains bend over the piece
of wood which resta between them
and take careful aim. At the
proper signal they begin to beat the
jrround in an effort to hit the object, but
onlv succeed in battering each other s
stick. Durinsr the excitement a player
is completely turned around and crosses
to his opponents' side. Woe for him If he
fails to right himself. With a "shinny on
your own side" he receives a crack over
the shins and a black and blue mark at
tests his carelessness.
"Kick the â¢wicket" is great sport for the
boys. A piece of hose about a foot" Ions
is placed agrainst a lamppost with one end
resting; on the sidewalk. The boy who is
"it" stands in front of the wicket ana
as one of his companions kicks the hose
he picks it up and rushes to replace it
before the runner has stopped his flight.
If he catches him moving he does the
kicking. â¢ .
"Leapfrog" is a speedy means or domjj
an errand. Two bovs start out for the
bakery and tach in turn bends his bacK
so that his companion car. vault over him.
Sometimes a half dozen lads engage in
the sport and it is a ludicrous sight to see
them spread out along the block with
backs in air like cats on a back yard
fence preparing for a fray.
Tops are growing less in favor with the
youngsters. This is due to the stone
sidewalks, which will not permit them to
spin their tops to any great extent. The
impact of the "peg" against the stone
dulls the steel and oftentimes spoils the
lop In the days of th<? wooden walk the
boys found no greater pleasure than play
ing ring The top was sjiun in the center
of the ring, and if it "died out" and did
not ron clear of the circular chalk line
the top had to remain a.? a target for
\Ue pens of the other players.
For a time iug-of-war" was In vogue.
Cleats -were affixed to long planks, and
teams from rival streets would pull lor
tupremaoy. These contests soon grew un
popular, as they generally ended in a
tifht. The anchor man would be charged
with trickery, and the contest that could
not be settled by pulling was usually de
cided by the use of \nature"s weapons.
Black eyes and bodily bruises seldom met
favor at homo, and another beating was
always due the unfortunate participant
in such a quarrel. Thus it was that the
"tug-of-war" grew in disfavor.
After supper the small boy finds amuse
ment playing "tic-tac-to," "one foot off
ihe gutter." "prisoner's base" and "tal
ly-i-ho." The lirst pastime is a favorite
with him. A spool of black thread, a
pin and a. nail are required for the fUn.
The lady who tnrows water on her steps
to keep the boys from congregating there
is the sufferer. One of the youngsters
quietly slips up to her window, and secure
ly fastens the pin to the sash. The thread
is unwoend for quite a distance and then
the sport grows interesting. The constant
"tic-tac" against the window disturbs
the peaco of mind of the inmates of the
house and they come out to investigate
As soon as trey put io'an appearance thÂ»
noise subsides, only to continue again
when they re-enter the house. This is
how the small boy secures revenge.
The American youth is full of fun and
activity. He is always ready to play and
would rather be at one of his favorite
pastimes than go to the best entertain
ment on earth, unless it be a circus. He
has a strong penchant for "the latter and
will be good for a whole week, cut wood,
go errands and wash himself twice a day
for the privilege of seeing the performing
. elephant and the funny clowns. He often
recalls his visit to the circus by having
one himself. Then it is that the fond
, parent wishes that she had never taken
her offspring to the show. The little fel
. low ransacks the house for gaudy ma
\ terial for his costumes and he generally
â¢' cuts up dresses in his enthusiasm. A bot
tle or a sack is the price of admission to
| the theater, which is usually in a dark
Â» and damp basement. If the house is not
J set on fire by the actors the owner of the
I bunding is in luck. After the perform
ance the actors gather the bottles and
-, sacks together ami dispose of them to a
Â» passing junk dealer. The proceeds,
3 amounting to not more than 10 cents, is
s used in buying chewing candy. ' ;
g It is due to the foregoing pastimes that
e the American boy is so strong, healthy
e and courageous. These qualities are de
_ veloped in him by constant rivalry in
r feats of strength and skill with his com
i panions. LOUIS LEVY, .

A LOVER'S* INQTJIRT.
I Here Is an Ingenious Circassian atory:
A man was walking; along one road and
a woman along another. The roads finally
united and the man and the woman reach
ing the junction at the same time, went
on from there together. The man was
carrying a large iron kettle on his back;
in one hand he held by the-leg a lty
chicken, in the other a cane; and he waÂ»
leading a goat. Just as they were coming
to a deep, dark ravine the woman said to
the man:
"I am afraid to go through that dark
ravine with you. It Is a lonely place, and
you might overpower me and kiss me by
force." .
"It you are afraid of that," said tnÂ«
man, "you shouldn't. have walked with
me at all. How can I possibly overcome
you and"kiss you by.force when I have
this great Iron kettle on my back, a can*
in one hand and a live chicken in the
other, and am leading this coat? I might
as well be tied hand and foot."
"Tes." replied tlie woman, **but If you
should stick your cane in the ground and
tie your goat to it, and turn the kettle
bottom side up and put the chicken under
it. then you might wickedly kiss me In
spite of my resistance."
"Success to thy Ingenuity. O woman,"
said the man to himself. "I should never
have thought of this expedient."
And when they came to the ravine be
stuck his cane Into the ground and tied
the goat to It. gave the chicken to the
woman, saying. "Hold It while I cut
some grass for ihe goat." and then, lower
ing the kettle from his shoulders, he
wickedly kissed the woman, as she wu
afraid he would.âStray Stories.

8Ralston knew that as soon an the rail
road was completed across the continent
there would be an Influx of Eastern and
European capitalists, and he wished to
entertain them suitably, that they might
be more readily persuaded to invest here.
In the big stone stables of Belmont there
were usually from eighty to a hundred
horses, as good as could be bought, and
on Sunday mornings there would often
be four four-hor*-* coaches sent out loaded
with guests, to say nothing of two-seat
err, buggies and saddle horses.
Ralston helped build roads all over his
part of the country-, and the solid stone
bedded highways which he prepared for
public use are still the delight of bicyclists
and automobilers who perhaps never
heard of the name of the man who con
structed the boulevards that have made
San Mateo and Santa Clara euch favorite
outing grounds.
In the rear of the house Is a large Turk

my older sisters, who were, forever men

"Mr. Ralston never took the train to
Belmont.
"There were several reasons. One was
that he did not like the railroad people;
he sent all of his freight by steamer, hav
ing bought a wharf for that purpose.
Then it was "inconvenient to arrange his
business to suit the exactions of a time
table; but, most of all, his reason was
that be could beat the train any way,
and besides there was the glorious fun of
coaching.
"On this particular occasion the coach
had gathered us up, a party of ten, and
called for Mr. Ralston at the bank last of
all.

ties were of all sorts, from the quiet times
when a few bright Bohemians were driven
down by himself In hi 3 private coach to
meet a theatrical troupe who were already
being entertained and entertaining there
to the grand affairs, such as the times
when special trains conveyed San Fran
cisco society en masse to banquet with
Admiral Farragut or General Sherman.
Ralston, whether voluntarily or by ac
cident, died as a result of grief from the
treatment given him by his old associate*
at the time of the suspension of the Bank
of California. The Beimont place fell into

small wells and springs which failed.
Arter that a tremendous cavern waa ex
cavated in the mountain side back of the
house and lined with masonry. All of tho
rainwater from the roof was led into this
but still the supply was Insufficient. A
diamond drill from the mines waa then
set to work in the valley near his private
eras works in front of the house. At a
great depth, and before water was
reached, the drill struck a ledge of jasper
which resisted all efforts and finally It
broke off, useless.

His final and successful plan was to buy
a mountain tract across the valley and
build a large stone dam, fifty feet high
which created an artificial lake that has
given a perpetual supply ever since.
From here the water Is led across the
valley In a six-Inch main to the subter
ranean lakes and reservoirs around and
under the house, and also to smaller ones
on the hill above. A *eparate system of
fire plugs all over the buildings and on thÂ»
roofs are directly connected with the high
pressure of the water frpm the mountain
and in addition a large steam fire pump
waa located next to the Turkish bath, in
which steam was kept up continually

froni the dust of the ride, and then
dressed for dinner. I delighted myself for
an hour In looking at marBles. bronzes

"There were some twenty persons at
the table, yet so large were the rooms
so attentive the waiters, and above all
the powerful personality of the host <?n'
pervading that all seemed to blend and
concentrate until it was like the smallest
and coziest of family affairs.
"The dinner, the waiters and chef had
all been brought from the city thatÂ»morn
lng, as was the custom when there was
any sort of a function. While everything'
was elaborate. It was apparently simple
and so smoothly regulated that there was
none of the stiffness which usually domi
nates. An orchestra was placed In the
mezzanine floor of the reception hall and
filled, the house with its music.
"After dinner there were more "arrivals
In carriages of guests from neighboring
villas at San Mateo and Redwood.
"In the meantime the great partitions
between the billiard and dining rooms and
the reception hall had been raised : and
the' doors opened between corridors and
music room, so that we could dance round
and round the main fk>or of the house;
something over a block the distance was.
â¢Some of the time we- were under the
bright glare of the myriad prismed glass
chandeliers, then gliding into the â¢ semi

beneath us.

: ."Before 1 o'clock all but the inmates of
drlver had barely time to spring into a
eeat on the rear before we were off with
a rush, for it was hl3 purpose to go out
tho Mission plank road and take an even
start with the train as it left Valencia
Btreet.
"In those days wind blew and sand flew
in San Francisco as it .never . does now
and Mr. Ralston made the excuse as we
were going "but Mission street that he
would whip up a little and get us out of

"The old plank' road rumbled . and
ewayed underneath us and the flying sand
cut our faces, even through our heavy
veils. When we came .to the' end of the
Band and the plank roud the train was
whistling behind us and Mr. Ralston
whipped up a little more, as he called it.
As a matter of fact, the horses needed
no whipping, all they wanted was the
chance, and they seemed willing to do tho
going. After we got to the top of the
grade and In sight of the ocean our speed
was again increased. It seemed as though
every change of the road was excuse for
faster traveling.
" 'If the horses cannot trot fast enough
they can run,' was the way that our gen
tleman driver looked at traveling gaits :
it made no difference to him how a horse
traveled so that he got there.
"We made two changes of teams and
the last one took us over roads which
were built for the purpose, with easy
turns and well crowned surface. We lost
a little on the train, a*s it made/up time on
the straight reaches, and when it stopped
fit a station we would be up with it again.
As we swung out 1 of the long straight road
into the avenue which led to Belmont, we
crossed not a hundred feet ahead of the
train, which was slowing down as it came
into the station.

things brought up to my room, which was

along past the tree branches that over
hung the driveway. A beautiful hazy val
ley with a blue mountain rim around it,
opened away on our left, and Just below
the roadway a heavy black 6moke rolled
up from the private gas works that set
the Belmont house ablaze with light.
"We drew up under the porte-cochere
and bundled down hastily, for. the horses
were shaking oft great flaky Â¦ masses ; of
foam and lather and < the grooms were
anxious to get them in the stables to cool.
"Once in the house It was a succession
of surprises and delights that .did not
cease until I left.
Descending by a concealed stairway from
the interior of the house, one found a
landing at the bottom, and from there
might take a trip with candle torches as

a blight upon Belmont; but says it not in
â¢words, but thus:"
"Belmont cost Ralston a million to
build. It is as good as newâ but, Ralston
lived there, lost his life and fortune.
Fharon lived there; became entangled in
Troubles which drove him. miserable, to
his grave. It was tried as a school and

But hoodoos cannot harm nor omens

words, "a sanitarium for the treatment

It seems that there could be no better
end for the beautiful villa at Belmont
than that it should become an asylum for
the insane. There is at least wildness an<i
romance in that, and the place is one
wh'eh should never come to a prosaic end;
its whole existence, and even the ground
on which it stood, has been a tangled
mass of mysteries, underground pass-ager-.
subterranean lakes, romances, tragedies
and wild adventures.
The mirrored walls which for thirty
years reflected the most beautiful faces
which passed through California will now
return but the grin of the idiot and the
dark mask which madness casts over tho
light of reason, for Celmont House is to
be made the greatest private insane
asylum in America.

built for nothing: else Than to delight every
one of the five senses. A million dollars
was epent for comforts and convenience
only: not a dollar was wasted on the ex

tof America. The question that again pre
sents itself Is, whom have we besides
Ccusa, and should America be satisfied
with cue Sousa, or ought we to have men
of musical mark and fame consistent with
the fame and greatness of our country?
Whom have we sent to Europe as a rep
resentative of this great art? Some years
agj we sent, I think, "Hlind . Tom" to
Europe, but he was a musical freak. But
tnink of the artists Europe has sent to
us, and the vast sums of money America
has paid fcr the privilege of hearing them!
Every time Padtrews'ti closes an Ameri
can tour he takes home to his Polish bank
hundreds-, of thousand. 1 ", cf dollars. But
there are artists in Europe who are loth
to leave the congenial atmosphere of their
country. Ysaye, the great violinist, is
sought for by American managers. He
pimply shrugs his shoulders and says.:
"Why should I go to America, so far
away? Ucsldes I have not time enough
to serve my European patrons." One can
readily understand this artist's diffidence
of going to America after one has seen
him greeted by a cultured European au
dience, who pay three or. four times what
we are willing to pay for a concert here.
Their cheers and bravos are expressions
of appreciation, and their enthusiasm
Fccms to be without limit.
Every one who understands admits and
accepts that music Is the sublime speech
of the soul, the higher condition, the bet
ter life. Its effects are reflnlngr. " Mus'.c
tells sweetly the Joys and nassions of life;
It takes from sorrows half their burden
and robs anguish of its keenest sting; it
halls the seasons and promotes love of
country, and or home. It Is the universal
singers who have held prominence before
the world have been five American ladies,
and strange to say, three of them are
Californlansâ Sibyl Sanderson. Emma
Nevada and the mest recent and now
famous little songstress. Rose Relda. The
other two are Nordica and Emma Eames.
But have we any world-famous American
violinist, piar.lst, or 'celliyt who acquired
h's educat'en in this, country and who
haÂ« farced his way to the front rank?
Certiir.ly not.
In patntlns we l:avÂ» done a little moreâ
tt l^KJt. something more than in mus'c
âbut our painters did not acquire their
education in America: at boys or young
rr.en they went abroad and worker vith
Jh.-it energy which is distinctively Amer
ican until the laurel wreaths fell upon
their brow?. While In Munich I met Toby
Kosenthal. possibly the most famous of
American painters to-day, the author of
â¢'Cat of the Frying Pan Into the Fire,"
"The Seminary Alarm." "The Vacant

pictures. He is one of those artists
whose patrons consider themselves hon

EDUCATION IN THE ARTS
Every one of these names Is covered
with honor and glory. To-day Ysaye is
the world's greatest violin virtuoso, play
ing Â¦ with passion and technique not
equaled by any living artist, while Ceasar
Thomson is accepted as the highest au
thority In technique, which position he oc
cupies at the Royal Conservatory at Brus
sels, while Ovide Musin; combining the
two great faculties of virtuoso and tech
niclan, inspires his pupils with a knowl
edge of both, improving the sweetness of
tone and bringing the technique to a high
degree of perfection. It is a musical feast
to be present at the "concouring exer
cises" or public contest that takes place
at the Conservatory of Liege. Many read
ers win confess they have never heard
of the little city of Liege until they read
of it here, and yet it holds the place of
honor in the musical world for the great
work it has done.
Before entering the Liege Conservatory
pupils must have acquired a high stand
ard in music, and must pass an examina
tion before the Directory of the Conserva
tor}', and if accepted, they are ma
triculated and receive their instruction at
a cost of $40 r.*r annum in American
money. They get two lessons a week from
the best masters in Europe, and when
you hear a class at work you are already
listening to good musicians. I recall Mu
sin's dags, consisting of sixteen pupils,
eight of them Americans. Every member
of this class promises to become groat.
But there Is not a student in that class
who does not practice from six to ten
hours every day, and when they come to
"concour," which takes place once a
year before a jury of the most celebrated
musicians from all over Europe, each
pupil must present a. repertoire of at least,
eight to ten classics." which must be
played from memory. To give an idea of
the character of music that they are re

The King of Belgium remarked to an
American that many Americana lived in
Belgium and that fact pleased his .Ma
jesty much, for he caid:, "We havÂ«
learned to love you people and you flatter
ua by coming to live with us and partak
ing of our art instructing Institutions."
The gentleman to whom this remark was
addressed, in reply 5Â»aid: "Belgium has
two Kings; you. your Majesty, who re
mains at home and rules your ' people-,
while Ysaye, the king of the violin, tours
the world and by his matchless playing
conquers the hearts of the people every
where; and to the people, who a3k "Where
does he hail from? whence does ha
come?' are answered 'From the home" of
the violin. Belgium, whose masters In
music have made more conauests tnan

"Yes, we are happy to have the hearts nt
the world touched by the sentiment "and
genius born In our people. Our musician j
honor U3 and we honor them."
The student who deletes himself tojhe
severe and arduous labor in order to pro
duce melodious sounds that give us great
pleasure may bring irreat sacrifices;, but
we love and honor him. Success Is. most
difficult even at the btrst, and when, wa i
know the hardships that must be borne *
before that end is attained our nation can
well afford to do Its .part to helo the

It has often been suggested that some
of our multl-mllllonalres might found such
an institution. This would not answer the
purpose. Such an institution must be
under the protection of the Government
and carry with It the Government's seal,
for that would give it verity, and the stu
dent coming from thin institution with
the seal of the Government on his dip
loma would be accepted wherever he
went. The Government would not be the
loser, because the people who pay the
taxes would, for themselves or their
neighbor, receive the benefits, and all the
vast amount of money spent abroad would
be spent at home, keeping the family tie
from being severed, hearts from being
broken ana American students from ap
pearing as mendlcant3 In foreign lands,
when they can always be ladies and gen
tlemen in high repute at home, honored
for their work by their countrymen in
their own country.
What is done for music should be dona
for painting. The entire American people
would come with applause tojthe Congress
that would vote an appropriation for rhe

and successfully brings to a conclusion

Schiller. Mendelssohn, Peganini, and oth
ers too numerous to mention. Where do
you behold them In America? Echo an
swers, where? Every great city !n Europe
maintains a grand opera during the sea
son. America maintains one. for a few
months only, in the great metropolis of
New York, ard all the artists are foreign
ers. Only a short time ago one of the
managers of the great American Opera
Company, while looking for talent in
Europe, came In contact with an Amer
ican stnger, whose voice Is exceptionally
fine, and after hearing her he remarked
that her voice was very beautiful, but
she was an American and therefore
would not do for America, and yet this
manager expects Americans to patronize
him and pay him American money. It is
time that this sort of thing should be
stopped. "America for Americans" ought
to be the war cry, but America must
establish Institutions In America that can
cultivate and graduate musicians, vocal
and instrumental, to compose the great
opera companies of our country, which
shall be patronized because they axa
Americans, educated and cultivated in
America, at an American institution. It
rests with the people of this country
whether we shall continue falling: In
voice, refuse to build, foster and maintain
these temples of refinement, and continue
the slaves of Kurope â nay, worse, enemies
to I he welfare of our own children.
The location of the national conserva
tory of music should be placed according
to the population, so that It might be ac
cessible by all sections of the country In
proportion to numbers. A certain standard
should be demanded, so as to make It
trie high finishing institution for the per
fection of instrumental as well as vocal
music. A regency should be established,
non-political In character, for the produc
tion and promulgation of standard and
classical music. Of course, at first It
would necessitate the bringing here of
well known masters from Europe, but In
a few years the institution - would
graduate Its own teachers and Americana
would take pride in the American-born
nnd American-educated musician. In
place of Importing musicians, we could
export: we could send our talent abroad:
notning would give us a higher standard
for culture and refinement and remova
the notion that we are barbarous Indians
than our musical representatives, who
would be able to win the plaudits of the
musical world abroad.
Musln of the Liege Conservatory Is well
known In America. He taught In New
York, but his talents were well known at
the institution from which he was gradu
ated, and the Directory determined upon
having him returned- to hl3 Alma Hater,
and made It so Interesting that he accept
ed the flattering offer and took the first
professorship, which evidences the -fact
that if there be anything good, in our
country that Europe wants, they send and
get it, giving preference to .the product Qt
their own country first. Every American
who loves music and loves his country
ought to become an advocate of the estab
lishment of an American conservatory of
music under the Government patronage.
At Brussels an American boy, totally
blind, took the first prize with distinction
and high honors over twenty competitors.
Professor Caesar Thomson protested that
the distinction should not bo to this boy.

Photographs on the Skin.
A scientific discovery is bound to be pic
turesque ard interesting and must attract
universal attention. A Roumanian chem
lpt named Dlnkeresco discovered a means
of combining., the substances which are
used in sensitizing paper for photographic
purposes so that they can be applied to
the human cuticle without Injuring It. and
the Fkin thus be made a sensitive plate
for the printing of photography. Dinker
esco'g remarkable discovery is a combina
tion of photography and the etching pro
cess, and that to some extent the image is
"bitten" into the cuticle.
At any rate, the impression is perma
nent, the image Â«Â» clear and distinct, and
the skin is not made a negative, but really
a sort of Fensitized paper. The Impres
eion does not wear away with the change
of the tissues and the renewal of the sur
face of the skin because the substances
or changes which have been produced by
the process of photography are renewed
according to the modification* produced
by the "biting" process. Just as those of
a tattooed outline are. And whatever the
mechanical means employed, the results
are remarkable. By this means every hu
man being becomes a sort of photograph
album. The likenesses of his friends, land

or with elgnlnc&nt events in his life, por

modern plow and a hustling salesman of
American agricultural machinery has a
hard time In Old Mexico. The well-known
traveler. Frederick A. Ober. tells an
amusing story of one of these "embas
eadors of commerce" who spent a year in
lifeless drudges they are for the most
part, with the stolidity of the Southern
Indian written on their faces. They look
as if their hand would rest on the plow
handle for all time to come and be satis
fled there. Once in a" while there is. a
flash of something more nearly Spanish
in these faces, but only once*1n a while.
They and the plow are part and parcel;
no enterprise, no ambition.
Hardly less primitive than the plow is
the ropewalk. A peon with a bulky bag
of fiber held round his body by a strap,
aided by the ministrations of a pictur
esque little girl, may be seen weaving a
lasso. The children are hardly more
than babies when they are put to work.
They are r.pt strong enough to help at the
plow, but they are useful at the rope walk
and the waterwheel. The Mexicans know
the meaning of work long before they
should know any word but play.
You call Mexico a lazy country, per
haps. You who make the guidebook
rounds of its villages in siesta hours. Re
member that in the early time, the cool
time, while you were still sleeping, these
people, big and little, .were up drawing
water and weaving lassos and . guiding
plows.
In so dry a land as much of Mexico is.
the question of water for domestic use
and for irrigation Is all-Important. The
water for household consumption in towns
is obtained from the public fountains,
which are in convenient plazas, and form
the favorite gossiping places ' for, the
women. When the women live near the
water supply they carry the Jars on their
heads,. but when the distance is too great
to permit of several trips to and fro half
a, . dozen earthenware . Jars are placed, on
each side of a burro, who has also to
carry his mistress. The girl tiding on the
burro wears guaraches, or leather san
dals, on her feet, and has her head and
the upper part of her body : covered . with
the rebozoâ a long, narrow shawl usually
of a blue color, with narrow stripes. When
the rebozo is drawn up over: the head' it
covers tho arms and breast, which other
wise are exposed.

and a people who ' aeserve tne miseries
that they willingly undergo.
To raise water for purposes of Irriga
tion-various primitive contrivances
used: A pair of .wooden wheels; Is often
set. up vertically, and Joined together at
the rims with. pieces of wood which" pro
|ect at one side like teeth, the circumfer
ences of the two wheels being about a
foot apart. On the transverse pieces of
"wood ; and ; between the rlms^ of the" two
wheels cans are fixed, which, when the'
wheel rotates, bring up the water, and as
they descend empty it into a trench or
ether, receptacle. The .wooden teeth.
clotn. isear by' stands a man who over
sees the work and in the tree hang the
eerapes or bright striped blankets of all
three. Similar methods of irrigation are
-often seen in Egypt and in other coun
tries where ancient customs and old-tiruo
methods are still in vogue.
Though there are to be seen In the cltic3
and towns of Mexico many handsome
stone and brick houses. . with marble
floors and fine decorations, the Mexican
peasant's 'home is almost always an
adobe hut. The large bricks are made of
clay, roughly pressed into wooden molds
and dried In the sun. When well made
the adobe house is by no means without
merit, being cool in hot weather an-.i
warm In cold.
This fact is the argument for It In our
own southern cities, where It is occasion
ally being used nowadays for handsomer
residences. People who build with It
claim that the Mexicans and early Call
fornlans knew their own climate. But it
is a far different' thing to use the adobe
in; connection with perfectly finished
walls, hardwood floors, heavy doors and
secure windows from what it is to use
It as primitive Mexico does. The ground
for a floor, openings for- windows and
doors, rickety furniture if there be any
furniture at allâ these are the homes of
the people.
It is an easy thing to build these houses
and that means a great deal in a climate
of many blistering days.
Owing to the large alse of the adobe
the labor of bulldlng'a house is consider
ably less than when smaller bricks are
used. '..-...

Joking Pictures of Sound.
. Very much has been done In the way

memclr on the practical ride of this ques
tion is an article by Benjamin F. Sharp**.
When an unmixed tone is received In a
Helmholtz resonator. In the wall of which
Is inserted a very thin glass plate, the
natural pitch of which Is not too different
from the tone, the plate vibrates to the
tone with an amplitude having an ulti
mate relation to the energy of the tone.
Measurement of this amplitude become
easy it the vibrating plate Is made to bear
a tiny mirror, which mirror forms ono
element of a system of mirrors constitut
ing a Michelson's refractometer.
So delicate^ls this means of indication
that a shifting of the mirror half a wave
length of light will cause such a shifting
to ono side of the Interference bonds that
each , dark band will taka the position
previously occupied by the next dark
band. With a telescope and micrometer
each band may with proper adjustment
be subdivided Into 100 parts, giving a
means of recording a shift equal to as
little as one two-hundredth of a wave
length. It need scarcely be said that th.Â»
rapid shifts thus produced by a tone- can

When E. Oliver Ashe, M. D., surgeon to
the Kimbcrley Hotpital, wrote his diary
of life and events in Kimbcrley during the
siege, it was far from his mind that his
chrowiclinsrs should appear in print. His
daily notes were taken merely with the
Idea of sending them to his mother. If the
opportunity should offer and his life was
not cut short by some flying Boer shell.
It is well that Dr. Ashe has consented to
have these notes published, for otherwise
the world would have lost a most valua
ble addition to the history of this war.
His position as surgeon of the hospital
gave the doctor an excellent opportunity
of being In the center of all the trouble,
and the fact that he was not writing
with a view to subsequent publication,
but merely a? an eyewitness and partici
pant recording events for the information
<:f his family, kept his pen from straying
tn make space and confined it to an Inter
esting and reliable etatcment of fact
alone.
Dr. Ashe has written an Introduction
for his diary in which he explains the
importance of ICImberley and why the
Boers were so anxious to capture It. For
one thing, the old friend of the Boers,
Cecil Rhodes, was in the town, and that
alone probably Increased their anxiety,
but aside from their desire to (settle up
old scores with Rhodes. Klmberley itself
was a prize worth a struggle. In speak
ing of its vaJue to either side, Dr. Ashe
says:
"Kimberloy Is the second largest town
in Cape Colony, and is the largest dia
mond mining center in the world. It came
into existence in 1870. with the discovery
of diamonds, and. including Its suburbs
of Kenilworth, Bcaconsfleld and Wessel
ton. has now a population of about 40,0*30,
of which 23.000 are white. The three prin
cipal minesâ Kim berley, De Beers and
Wesseltonâ are worked by the De Beers
Consolidated Mines Company, Ltd. ' This
immense company, of which Mr. Khodes
is the chairman, has a capital of nearly
four millions; pays well over a million a
year in wages, and turns out Â£10,000 worth
of rough diamonds every working day.
All Kimberley makes Its living directly or
Indirectly from the company, and for all
practical purposes Klmberley and the
company are one."
In his professional capacity the author's
description of the effect of. 'the- Mauser
rifles vsed by the Dutch cannot fail to
interest. He says:
"We doctors h-ad all of us seen, a few

The bullet, especially of the -Mauser ri

"All ripht, mammy!" remarked Ika
Anderson somewhat Irrelevantly.
Ike Anderson passed by the front of the
Cottage Hotel. A negro boy. who worked
about the place, was idly at the
porch door, shuffling lazily about at his
employment. Ike paused and looked ami
ably at him for some moments.
"Good morning, colored scion," he said
pleasantly.
"Mawrin*. boss," paid the negro, grin
ning widely.
"Colored scion." said Ik*Â», "hereafter â

The negro scowled and muttered, and
the next moment sprang sprawling for

the heel of his shoe, in the proimn, not
cparing all of the foot. The negro went
ashy nalc. ar.d believed himself mortally

his visitor, who said, evenly and calmly:

The blue flame burned a trifle higher
In Ike Anderson's brain. He was grow
ing very much Intoxicated, and therefore
very Qttlct arid very sober looking. He
did not yell and flourish his revolvers,
but walked along decently, engaged in
thought. He was a sandy complexloned
man, not ov<t 5 feet 6 inches in height.
KiÂ» lonÂ« front teeth projected very much,
pivinjr him a strange look. His chin was
rot heavy and square, but pointed, and
his Jaws were narrow. His eye was said
by some lo have been hazel when he was
sober, though ethers said it was blue or
pray. No one had ever looked into It
carefully enough to tell its color when
Ike Anderson was drunk, and he was to
day.
"Thank you." he said softly, and shot
the glass of straws off tne counter.
"Thank you. Not after m* 1 ." The whisky
ran out over the floor, out of the door,
over the path and into the road, but no
ore raised a voice in rebuke.
Ike And* rson stepped into a saloon and
took a straw from a Rlass standing on the

in its selection. "I'm very thirsty." he
remarked plaintively. Saying which he

An impulse to walk seized him and he
did so, yuictly. steadily, until he met a
urangtr, a man whose clothing bespoke
his residence in another region.
"Oood-tnoriiing, gentle s:r." said Ike.

The actual Bt&tÂ£ of affairs was best known

There are many a.lir.irable things about

Those who have read "A Dream of a

of the scenery and people around Lako

ing sketch by F. R. Guernsey. Mr. Guern
sey Is editor of the Mexican Herald, and

Boston Herald:
"I have just been reading 'A Dream of
a Throne." by Charles Fleming Embree. a
most attractive personality, of whom the
literary monthlies in the I'nited State*
have had nothing to ray. Here is a warm,
romantic, most engaging young spirit, a
man of hardly 27 years, born in Indiana
nnd resident here for a r>w years past.
He has done other wcrk in fiction, but thl.Â»
stirring. Dumas-like tale cf the lake coun
try of Western Mexico Is his best. There*
is something about Embree which Is spon
taneously graceful; he suggests, tr. man
ner and habits, the beloved Stevenson.
"Mr. Embree had a brief course of prac
tical journalism in Chicago; but hi3 bent
was romantic fiction, and. marrying sud
denly, and in a wholly idyllic manner, ha
came with his young wife to Mexico, and
has lived many months on the shores of
Lake Chapala, renting a white stone cot
tage on the river road under the shadow
of Mt. San Miguel, and passing weeks on
the lake beach, or else making expeditions
in a big thatch roofed canoa- to every part
of the great lake, getting acquainted with
the Indian people, the fishers and ranch
ers, and the professional navigators of an
inland sea. which sometimes storms and
rages, as I have'seen it. Tremendously
romantic, this living on a Chapalar. canoa
with white-garmented sallor3, touching at
little villages embowered In mango and
orange. groves, meanwhile the guitar a
strumming and Spanish petenerast and se
guidlllas rising on the lake wind. Then
from Chapala a flitting to Guanajuato,
most romantically built of all Mexican
cities, and a Bohemian housekeeping In a
little house up on a high perched street,
the author filling himself with local color
for some forthcoming book. And from
Guanajuato the Embrees betook them
selves to Cuernavaca, wnere the ghost
of Herman Cortez lingers, haunting his
great castle like palace. I forget the naraa
of the street where the young author lives
now, but he heads his notes. 'Street of tha
House of the Hungry Wolf.' "

Ascending the throne at 31, he merely
fulfills a family usage which has been too
cfte-n carried out in dramatic and tragic
circumstance?. Charles Albert was
crov.rc-il at 33; Victor Emmanuel II at 29;
Humbert I at 34. They all worked stren
uously. The iron crown of Theodolinda Is
no unmeaning symbol.
AH this creates presumption and pre
possession in favor of the new monarch.
But beyond this, the public has no opin
ion about him, nor any knowledge whtre
â¢nith to form an opinion. He Is an abso
lutely unknown factor to tho public, fpr
he has been. first brought up in the prilv
acy of a closed family circle, and then
Â«e<?n only in the routine of military per
formances He has experienced little, or
rather nothing, of political life, during
either the first period of his life, which
was passed in court at Rome, nor the
second, which was spent In campâ so to
speakâ at Naples. Yet the enigma of his
personality is of Interest even to repub
lican statesmen abroad.
Xothlng but Rontgen rays will give us
any insight, and the only media of this
kind must be sought in an Inventory of
Â¦what he has learned, In the estimates of
him found by his master's, and In tho
consideration of his first acts.
These few lights are, however, strong
and valuable. Speaking of the Tallce edi
tion of the "Divine Comedy," which. In
18S6. the late King desired should bo
dedicated to his son, that omnifarious
and omnivorous scholar. Ruggiero
Boughi, declared that few youths had re
ceived so substantial and so wise an ed
ucation as the future King. Nor did
Boughi take less into account the results
and the assimilation, than the studies of
th* royal youth and the efforts of his
instructors, for he said that Victor Em
manuel had quickness of apprehension
and a truly prodigious memory. These
gifts do not make for genius; they are
not even allied to it; they may exist
apart from it. But a King may find hig
genius among his counselors. Ills own
calling requires merely that he shall havo
learned much, and remembered well.
And Victor Emmanuel III has sufficient
mental agility to be able to use his in
exhaustible memory.
1'ntil his twelfth year, his education
was mainly physical. He was not teased
with hard study. Only the acquiring of a
prjcticul acquaintance with Italian.
French and English was expected of
him. He lived In the sweet shelter of an
enlightened love: that of Queen Margaret,
his mother and the Idol of Italy. Then
fct twelve, he bt pan to study. Heretofore,
his study had been almost a recreation."
thenceforward, his amusements were to

these diversions he has retained and de

ft medals and coins in antiquarian Italy
and probably in the world, and this with
such intelligence that he Is an authorlta
tiTo numismatist, so much so that he has
contemplated, if not begun, a folio corpus
Itallcorum memmorum. This is a strange
and strong and specially royal teaching of
universal history, as the learned can telL
It arose out of his boyish curiosity over
a coin of the late Pope Pius IX, or as an
other version has it, out of his interest
over some coins of ancient Rome.
Not his diversions .only were turned to
Intellectual "profit, but even his pains.
One day the v King, his father, was de
tained with the Cabinet Minister for the
signing of decrees; the dinner was de
ferred; the Crown Prince began positive
ly to suffer â¢ the pangs of hunger.
"Mother, I am . hungry." he cried.
He was only 13 years of age. _ His
mother took the "Divine Comedy," opened
it at the thirty-third canto of tho "In
ferno," and gave It to the Prince to read.
The part opened was the story of tho
starvation of Count Ugollno and his chil
dren in the dungeon tower of tho Gua
landl.
Under these methods Victor Emmanuel
was able to speak Frencn and English, as
well as Italit-n. with perfect correctness
at lz; was early busied In the reading of
books in all three language? suited to his
special avocation; was engaged in the ar
dent pursuit of literary, historical, geo
graphical and mathematical studies, and
'in the cultivation of the physical sciences,
constitutional law, political economy and
German, the which language he began
to acquire while he was completing his
mastery of French and English.
The most democratic reader will Â«eo
at a glance the relation which exists be
tween such studies and the business of
kingcraft, but which bears still more
nearly, with the exclusion of constitu
tional law, in the case of military theory
and practice, geography and history. The
Prince Is a soldier, as all Kings are nowa
days, and in the specialized way that
modern European sovereigns must be. He
has resided a year in his titular city of
Naples, giving proof of activity and effi
ciency as generaf in command of the
Tenth Army Corps. Of geography and
history ho Is described as nothing less
than an encyclopedia.
But is his Imagination fired with the
visions of expansion which a familiarity
with geography brings, or with the phan
tasmagoria of the past in history? Un
happily, no; for he is devoid of fantasia,
says his instructor; for five and a half
years in Italian literature, Deputy Mo-
randl. and by fantasia I take it that th*
professor means the two gifts which ws
distinguish apart as imagination and
fancy. Thus, of the Italian poors rno
Prince prefers Dante, and. likes Arlosto
least. The divine poet is the positive poet.
"However strange, however grotesq-ueÂ»"
writes Lord Macaulay, "may be tho ap
pearance which Dante undertakes to de
scribe, he never shrinks from descrfblnc
It. He gives us the shape, the color, the

A ROMANCE
OF PEKINGThe Camera Catches the Flea Five Thow
sand Times as Large as He
Really Is
RpHE eye of the camera has been
| brought to bear upon the flea. Con
11 siderinjj the difficulty with which the
human optic meets In trying to ac
complish the same thing this is a remark
able feat. Vreo and untrammelcd the do
mestic flea has Ions cavorted unon green
pastures, so to speak, in defiance of direct
human investigation u:td it remained for
Fred Cloulman, a photographer of Bos
ton, to produce photographic results, as
shown in the accompanying 5000 times en
larged reproductions.
No. 1 shows the festive creature In a
pose of Impending action. The long hind
legs are poised ready for a leap that,
were the flea an elephant, would . carry
him twice and a half around the earth,
allowing a distance proportionate to the
relative size. The accompanying two
pairs of assistant legs also shown are
simply aids In the clever "cive and cet
away" tactics of the active little creature.
The small pair of antennae at the front of
the head are reserved for the attack of
prey and it is these that are responsible
for much human woe.
No. 2 shows an enlarged photograph ot
the head, lees and antennae and No. 3
the antennae alone. In the point3 of tho
antennae the poison of the Insect is con
cealed. When the flea goes dining it la
the antennae tfiat aro prodded Into the
flesh of its victim and through them th<j
b!ocd Is absorbed, the poison being emit
ted in the process.
It Is lamentable for San Franciscans
that Mr. Cloutman's irt does not extend,
further than to the photographing of thÂ«
fiendish insects. Did it portend the dis
covery of some meana for the permanent
extermination of the species his photo
graphic triumphs might be pointed out

suffering public.

One tradition snys that a famine visited
the islands and carried off the people, but
it is difficult to understand how that could

Many varieties of fruit grew wild on siijk"

There is another tradition which says

MARRIAGE CUSTOMS IN CHINA SEEM
RIDICULOUS IN OUR EYES
JHE marriage of the upper classes in
China is surrounded by a number
of very elaborate ceremonies, though
those of humbler station content
themselves with more primitive rites,
says the London Express.
Among the classes supposed to be better
off a great feast is one of the most im
portant items of the day's proceedings.
This, . which answers to the wedding
breakfast, is spread on tables at the east
and west of the dining hall. But. curi
ously 'enough, neither bride nor bride
groom is permitted to taste of the deli
cacies thereon displayed. Instead, aTmeal
for the "happy "man"- is 'spread; In Â¦ the
courtyard. Before the ceremony he. makes
obeisance to his father and the wedding
guests, kneeling down and knocking his
head six times against the ground. The
father hands him a goblet of wine and
tells- him to send for his bride."
The formula In the bidding never alters.
It is .in the following ,words: "Go, my son,
and, seek your wife, and behave in all
things with prudence and wisdom." The
sedan chair, or palanquin, which Is dis
patched for the reception of the bride. Is
invariably painted red, and is often richly
adorned- with, paintings and carvings.. A
profusion of gilding is always one of Its
most characteristic, features. A large pro
cession, ; including a band, of music, is
always sent to escort_ the blushing bride.
Gay lanterns and banners, torches, um
brellas and. fans-are always carried in
the procession, not to. mention various
emblems appropriate to the occasion.
Thus a tiny orange tree, well loaded with
golden fruit, is taken along as a' symbol
of a large family. A goose and a gander
are emblematical of conjugal fidelity,
while a dolphin means worldly prosperity
and a high. position. The color of all the
paraphernalia Is redâ the hue of rejoic-
ing. Red fans, red lanterns, red umbrel
las, together with red-painted palanquin
and the red costumes of the attendants,
make a bright splash of color. And with
the musicians blowing and thumping their
hardest, gongs beating, torches splutter
ing and flaring and lanterns gleaming, a
Chinese wedding procession appeals pow
erfully alike to eye and ear.
It Is etiquette for everybody to maka
way for. the cortege, and China's Penal
Code provides a severe punishment for
anybody neglecting to do so. â¢
Before the bride sets forth on her jour
ney to' her new abode, whither she Is
bidden' by a few ; lines written on red pa
per and presented by the friend of tha
bridegroomâ answering to the vEnglish
"best man"â she does kow-tow to her
father and mother, drinks a last cup of
wine and, kneeling, listens to harangues
from her parents. on the new state of Ufa
into -which she is now entering and her
duties therein. These orations. In the best
style of Chinese eloquence, occupy some
time." meanwhile the poor. little bride, on
her knees, listens with what patience she
may .coipmand- .Ere stepping into the pa
lanquin she "veils herself in silk of tho
orthodox shade of red, then the proces
sion starts.
Arrived at the house, a curious cere
mony-takes place,' the' bride being pre
sented with a tray containing rice and
betel nuts. She must prostrate herself at
the feet of her future husband, to denota
her complete submission to his will. Then
the girl unveils, and for the first time tha
bridegroom sees his bride's face.
.Ancestor worship and- the aldoratlon of
the heavens and the earth are essential
parts of .a; Chinese marriage ceremony,
though the formal adoration of the ances
tral tablets does not take place till the
third day after the wedding. The bride
at the wedding feast must prostrate her
self before her parents-in-law, to whom
she gives wine. The mother-in-law In her
turn i>resent3 the bride with a cup of
wine. Three days after marriage a grand
visit of ceremony is paid to the wife's pa

In 183S the Royal Laboratory made
among many other things, O>.97!>,606 of
these cartridges, which, if placed end to
end, would extend from Woolwich half
way to the Cape; in addition to 1.043,712
other cordite cartridges intended for the
Webley pistol and costing nearly $12 a
thousand to manufacture.
Cordite, by the way, which comes In
handy as an explosive In so many ways,
costs from 33 cents a poundâ not much
perhaps by the pound, but the price
mounts up when 945,560 pounds are manu
factured in the vear, as at Waltham Ab
bey.
Gunpowder varies in price according to
quality In a marvelous manner. One qual
ity of . which little is manufactured at
Waltham costs nearly $2 a hundred
pounds, while picric is quoted at about
$25 a hundred pounds; but powder at 15
cents a pound is generally used. Gun
cotton In two and one-half pJund slabs
measuring 6Â»>ix6Vfexl?4 inches costs 30 cents
a pound, and when by Its aid "Long
Toms" are disabled it is cheap at the
price. '
With regard to other weapons, .303
inch Maxims are quoted at about '$425,
without extras, by the Royal Small Arms
Factory at Enfield, while a handy Gard
ner-Gatllng chamber gun runs to about
$322 when taking a quantity. The , 63,712
Lee-Enfleld rifles turned out at the same
factory cost $13 CO each; 88,853 sword bay
onets. $1 70 each; lances cost $6 each,
without their flags, which run to 17 cents
each, and cavalry swords entailed an ex
penditure of over $4.
One interesting item in respect to the
panoply, of war refers to the cost of the
cuirass; the backs are priced at $12 25, the
fronts at $14 25 each;, but In addition to
these there are rivets for the shoulder,

THIS WILL GIVE AN INKLING WHERE
MONEY GOES IN WAR TIME
ONE of the sources of expense in
war may be described as "wast
age" of material. In the bombard
ment of Alexandria, between 7
a. m. and 4:39 p. m. the British
fleet In a somewhat vigorous fashion de
posited ZifZ shells upon Egyptian soil and
about 500 Egyptians were killed. This was
undoubtedly good shooting in view of the
fact that It took the Germans, when be-
Fieglng Mezieres in 1S70, at the rate of
three and one-half shells a minute, 193,000
large projectiles to kill 300 people, that is
to tay, C43 shells a head, and that the
Boers, in the earlier stage of the present
war, dumped' 2GS0 shells Into Ladysmith
and only killed eight persons.
In the Crimean War the total number
of combatants was MC0.300, and they fired
85.000,000 shots, with the result that 51,945
roldlers were killed In battle and 66,397
diod from their wounds; therefore, to all
intents and purposrs. 118,342 bullets found
a bIJlet and 88, SSI 658 were wasted.
In the Franco-German War., where the
weapons u?ed were of a superior quality,
especially as regards precision, the vic
torious host cf Germans fired off 30,000,000
email-arm cartridges and 353,003 rounds of
artillery, with the result that 77,000 French
troops were killed outright or died from
their wounds. The wastage, tnerefore, on
the German Fide amounted to 30,286,000
ehot and Ehell. and that on the side of the
French would amount to quite as much.
The ordinary man will now have an
inkling whrre money goes In war time.
It is fortunate in view of the fact that
after the battle of Modder Rii'er the
trenches in some places were knee deep
In cartridge cases, that cartridges are not
very expensive, costing the Royal Labor

At 10;30 o'efock the show is out and the
performers go to the sleeping-cars, and It
is there that the women of the circus are
at home. The sleepers of the Rlngling
Bros.' show are arranged exactly like
Pullman cars, with swinging, upper
berths, and are clean, well ventilated and
attractive. As a rule each married
couple has another married couple for
chums. Their sections usually are oppo
site, and their natural desire for. neat
ness, from force of habit. If from no
other cause, enables them to decorate
their berths with little articles of fane/
work, slipper cases, a tiny pair of silken
curtains at the windows; a little cabinet
with a lock upon the' door, toilet article-*

terpanesâeverything.' in fact, found: in a
well appointed sleeping apartment In a
house.
At 4:20 the afternoon show is over, and
thon comes supper, which is really a sub
stantial meal. Now comes an hour and a
half of rest. Gathered about in groups In
shady corners, the women of the circus
come together, bring out their embroi
dery and fancy work, chat, gossip and
talk of everything except their business,
which is rigidly tabooed. Seven o'clock

for the balance of the evening the rush
goes on, never seeming to end.
Dinner over, there Is another rush for

BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE CIRCUSThey Prefer Singing insects to Song-Birds- in Japan
Singing birds are esteemed In all coun
tries, hut it is only !n Japan that the mu
sical Bounds emitted by certain Insects
are appreciated.
Listening to these minute singers is, and
has been for mar.y centuries, a favorite
pastime of the Japanese, and has given
birth to an original commerce.
At Toklo, toward the end of May and
the bef Jnnis* of June, one sees suspended
under the verandas of houses beautiful
little cages of bamboo, from which break
upon the silence of the fresh twilight
etrange little whistlings, of metallic mod
ulation*, of llglit trills, which nil the air
with a delicate music. It Is habitually in
the evening, after the hour of the bath.,
that the people of Tofclo seat themselves
and listen with delight to the shrill con
cert.
The most prized of these singing insects
is the Euzumushi. Its name means "insect
bell," and the sound which it emits re-
Eexnbles that of a tiny silver bell. It is
a tiny black beetle, of a flat body and
very vulgar appearance.
The kntsuwa-mushl is so named because
Its cry resembles the sound made by a
horse In champing its bit. There are two
species of It, the one a light yellow and
the other a pale green. Really,, this Insect
Is none other than a kind of winged grass
hopper, of fat body and common in many
countries.
Another singing Insect much esteemed Is
the kirigirisu, which is but a very largo
grasshopper, producing varied, strident
sounds. Then there is the enamkordgf,
which Is a kind of cricket: the kusa-ht
bari. a minute grasshopper, which has a
sound of remarkable clearness. The kan

Elngs only' at midnight; the kanetntakl,
whose sons resembles the far-away sound
of a clock. In Tokio alone there are over
forty merchants dealing in singing in
sects. This commerce is of relatively ; re
cent origin, though for centuries the Jap
anese have been fond * of the muile of
these Insects. Formerly they would go 'n
parties to places . where the little mu
sicians abounded, pass the night there
extended upon mats, drinking tea or sakl
and listening to the harmony of the suzu-
mushi and kutsuwamushi.
It is only about 100; years ago that an
amateur named Choso had the Idea of
capturing one of these Insects for his own
particular diversion. Then the singing
season over, he forgot a certain number
in a closed vase. Great was his surprise,
on opening it the following year, to find
it filled with newly hatched young. . After
that he gave. himself up to the raising of
various species of singing. Insects, and so
founded a trade which has become flour
ishing. Actually the greater number of
singing Insects are artificially â¢ raised by
certain proceedings, so that their hatch
zing corresponds to the seasons when their
admirers love to listen to them and to
combine their sounds.* .

Queer Nations of People Who patronize the Dentist
"Dentists occasionally run acro?3 odd
things in their practice," said a member
of that . profession recently. "You are
aware that many are very particular con
cerning the plate in which artificial teeth
are set. - Some want gold, . others 'silver,'
vulcanite and. what not. But did you ever
hear of patients wearing th,elr own Initials
inside the mouth? ,
"We, recently prepared an upper set for
a gentleman well known In theatrical cir

wires of gold the wearer's Initials. An
other, roof plate, which we were privileged
to see, was a perfect masterpiece of artis
tic work. There were three horsemen de
picted In cold wire, fine as a hair, a tors-
- ground of,catstone and a crescent moon
of gleaming silverâ all set in the compo
sition of the roof. The teeth were of good
quality, but not remarkable, and the price
â¢was exactly $300. A person uncor.scicus
of the value of the Inner roof would have
set the price at $25."
"Very richly enameled was the dancing
girl -which decorated the false roof of a
one-time millionaire. The pictured lady
wore slippers set with .tiny diamonds and
the owner, being a great smoker, sported
an ordinary set when desirous of Indulg

"The most absurd thlnjf -we -wÂ»rÂ« ever

After a while the tip fell oft and the

Iflyou have no real knowledge of paint
ing your china decorating will be only
half successful, of course. Your eood
taste may guide you in the choice cf col
ors and you may be able to carry out
some simple geometrical designs with
dainty effect. You may attempt to do
morÂ», but there is darfger of your falling.
Designs can be drawn for you on the
porcelain and you can follow with your
brush, but your work will smack a bit
of the kindergarten. Don't attempt too
much. Leave the flowers and faces to
those who can handle a brush as one hav
ing authority.
Flowers, by the way, are Ies3 a fad for
table china than they once were. There
was a time, you remember, when a dozen
dessert plates represented a dozen kinds
of flowers. Conventional designs have
taken the place of those. Prim little pat
terns arc traced over the porcelain and a
prim little pair of Dresden lovers set In
medallion are the only break in the
monotony. A chocolate set in pale green
Is a pretty example of this style. A finely
wrought gold design relieves the green,
and Â«m the front of each cup. as well as
on the pitcher, the gaily gowned little
Dresden people courtesy In their own
fashion. The pitcher bears on Its oppo
site side a huge gold monogram.
Twenty dollars Is a liberal estimate foi
the cost of this setâ poneelain. colors anrt
firingâ and it sells for $75. So If you are
goins lnt:Â» keramics for profit you win
find a neat profit tucked away therein.
The charm of the Dresden ladies and
gets its full value at the first application,
but other tints need repetition. This Is a
wise. decree of fate, considering the price
of the gold paint.

THE Innocuous duel of France has

kind of duel, which Is bound to oe even,

mind and so the republic doesn't realize

others of recent occurrence, sprang out ot
the political agitation brought on by tha
Deroulede trial before the Senate. Dr.

Luxembourg during the progress of tha
trial, and he was in favor of banishment

Devillers. Deroulede's psysician. was pre
sent at the last meeting of the Medical
Club in the Avenue de l'Opera. This club
was rounded a few months ago by Dr.
Doleris. and to Dr. Pozzi had been offered
the pre-iident's chair. Dr. Devillers mads
seme disagreeable remarks to Dr. Pozzl
atout politics, but the .latter told him he
Aid not consider a medical club a fit place
for discu3sing such a question. Dr. Dcvil-
Ifrs thereupon insulted him. and threw
his glove in his face. The man was at
this Juncture taken care of by his friends
and led into another room.

It Hkely that Dcvtllers was not in his

chosen was Louveciennea, a small town

Pozzl had not done any fencing for tho
last ten years he chose swords. Dr. Devil
lers Is. on the other hand, an expert
fencer. The swords were sterilized to
prevent any Infection of the wounds, and
Immediately after the word was given Dr.
Devillera ran his sword Into Dr. Pozzl's

in Rome are accumulated the bones of
4000 deceased of that brotherhood. . A long
rectangular space under the structure
proper is 'divided into several plats, each
of which co.ntains a number of graves,
and at the head of each mound of rich
brown earth is placed a cross bearing 'the
name and dates of birth and death of the

of this covered burying ground are most
fantastically decorated with" the exhumed
bones of former . occupants of thÂ«sa

EASTERN END OF* GALUESTON, VA/HERE THE STORM AA/ROUGHT ITS 1A/ORST
GALYESTOX, Tex., Sept.
15. â The exodus trom.
f- Galveston grows as the fa
cilities for getting away from the
stricken city are increased. Boats
left here yesterday more frequent
ly than on any day t since the
storm, some proceeding directly
to Houston, via Buffalo Bayou,
and other? making" connection at
Texas City with the Great North
ern train. Among those who de
parted to-day were General Mc-
Kibben and Lieutenants Fergu
son and Perry, who were sent
here by the United States Gov
ernment when the news of the
horror was given to the world.
General McKibben will commun
icate with the War Department
on his arrival at Houston, and
thence proceed to San Antonio to
transact official business which
requires his attention. Before
leaving he was solicited by the
authorities to return, and expects
?to do so within the next four or
five days.
The news which was printed
here this morning in the shape of
a personal telegram from Vice
1 'resident Huntington of the
Southern Pacific that that road
is not to abandon Galveston has
created intense satisfaction and
has materially accelerated the
movement for the reconstruction
of the city.
Dr. Blount, State Health Offi
cer, to-day printed a statement
showing that apprehensions that
sickness will result from the over
flow just experienced are unjus
tified. He shows that in 1867* in
the midst of the widespread epi
tymc of yellow fever, a severe
storm occurred at Galveston in
the early days of October, result
ing in a deposit over a greater
portion of the city of slimy mud.
Not only did no sickness result,
but the cvclonic disturbance cut
short the yellow fever epidemic,
and but few cases of fever oc
curred thereafter.
Several thousand men are at
work clearing away the debris on
the beach. A hundred and fiftv
bodies were recovered from the
wreckage and burned yesterday.
No attempt is now being made to
identify recovered bodies. To-day
most of them are found naked
and mutilated beyond recogni
tion.
A New York relief train ar
rived last night with a number of

pALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â Excellent
I work in saving lives during the hurricane was done by the officers and crew of the reve
Â« nue cutter Galveston.. which was stationed at that port. The first mail through from
the stricken city reached Washington to-day and brought a letter from Chief Engineer YV. H.
Whitaker of the Galveston. Under date of September 9 he says:
"All sheds on the wharves have been leveled to the ground, or nearly so. I do not
think there is a house that has not been more or less damaged, or blown to the ground. While
the wind was blowing over sixty miles an hour we sent out a boat with a rescuing party to
row up one of the streets. The first trip they succeeded in saving thirteen women and children
and brought them back to the vessel in safety.
"It was useless to attempt to row the boat against 'the terrific wind, and as the water was
at that time not over a man's head in the street, a rope would be sent out to the nearest tele
graph pole and by that means a boat could be hauled along from pole to pole. This was ac
complished only b~y the most herculean efforts on the part of the men who led out the rope,
but between swimming, walking and floundering along in the teeth of the gale the rope
would finally be made fast. Then it was all that a crew of one officer and seven men could do
to pull a boat against the fierce blasts of the hurricane. By working! all Saturday afternoon
and evening and up to 1. o'clock Sunday morning the brave boys succeeded in rescuing
thirty-four men, women and children, whom they put in a place of' safety and provided them
with enough provisions for their immediate wants. Finally on account of the darkness, in
creasing violence of the storm and the vast amount of wreckage in the streets, the rescuing
party was reluctantly compelled to return to the vessel. . . .
"On board ship it was a period of intense anxiety for all hands. No one slept, and it
was only by superhuman efforts by officers and crew that we rode out the hiirjicane in safety.
With the exception of the carrying away of the port forward rigging and the smashing of all
the windows and skylights, the vessel sustained no serious injury. Not a single person on
board was injured in any way."

DALLAS, Sept. 13.â There Is urgent

Those there are wort out with

"There la no concealment to be made
of the fact that a pestilence is feared.
Efforts, of the local and military authori
ties are directed now to minimizing this
new danger. They are sending the wo
men and children to the interior as fast

remain for a time at least. There is work
for thousands of them, and work that
must be done. The disposition of bodies
continues to be one of the largest duties,
and besides this there are yet In the city

which need" attention." The stagnant pools
and the decomposing bodies and carcasses
are a threatening phase to life that makes
a man tremble. Thousands of barrels of

AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. 15.â
Governor Savers received
the following official report
as to conditions in Galveston:
"Galveston, Tex., Sept. 14. â
Hon. Joseph D. Savers, Gover
nor: After the fullest possible in
vestigation here we feel justified
in saying- to you and through you
to the American people that no
such disaster has ever â¢ overtaken
any community or section in the
history of our country. The loss
of life is appalling and can never
be accurately determined. It is
estimated at from 3000 to Sooo
people. There is not a home in
Galveston that has not been in
jured, while thousands have been
destroyed. The property loss
represents accumulations of sixty
years and more millions than can
be safely stated. Under these
conditions, with ten Â¦ thousand
people homeless and destitute,
with the entire population under
a stress and strain difficult to de
scribe, we appeal in the hour of
our great emergency to the sym
pathy and aid of mankind.
1i USTIX, Tex., Sept. 15.â Many heartrending reports and
/-\ appeals for aid from the country districts of the devastated
coast section were received here to-day. Help has been
slow to reach these suffering people, owing to the fact that the
calamity at Galveston has overshadowed all other distress. The
Governor, however, has the matter well in hand, and is directing
the work of organizing relief committees at the smaller towns
and remote communities in Brazoria, Fort Bend and other
counties of that section. He to-day sent a large amount of'
money to be expended for the relief of the homeless and hungry
of Andleton, Scabrooke, Alvin, Hitchcock. Richmond and Ros
enberg. Provisions, clothing and medicine will be bought and
properly distributed. There is much sickness in these places
and medical aid is needed at most of them.
The suffering among the negroes and country people is piti
ful. All crops have been completely destroyed. Many of the
unfortunate people have their homes along the Brazos River,
and were victims of the devastating- flood which swept down
that valley last year, and again only a few months ago. This is
the third calamity that has come to them within less than two
years. Their property is all gone. Many formerly wealthy plant
ers are now destitute and dependent upon the charity of the peo
ple for food atjd clothing. For a third time all plantation build
ings have been destroyed, the country merchants have fared no
better, and there is no, longer a place at which the plantations
can get credit to make a new start. The land remains, but it is
so late in the season that no crop can be made until next year.
There are a thousand negroes in the thickly settled "Black
Belt" who will have to be fed until they can be provided with
Â«=rÂ»mc kind of work. J. L. Merdill, a .well-known planter living
near Richmond. Texas, arrived here to-day. He lost all of his
buildings and cotton crop. He says the cane crop is badly dam
aged, but some of it will be saved. He reports that the negroes
of his section are in destitute condition and badly in need of
help. Many of them are flocking into the towns with their fam
ilies, which makes the situation worse instead of improving it.
He thinks some kind of public work should be given the negroes
until they can be used on the plantations where they were em
ployed when the storm came.

Lieutenant John Ricketts testified that

"GALVESTON, Tex., Sept. 14.â To the
Associated Press. Memphis, Tenn.: I am
In receipt of thousands of telegrams of
fering assistance and inquiring about ab
sent friends and relatives. All of these
have been promptly answered, but re
stricted communication has probably
served to cause delay in transmission and
delivery. The telegraph companies are
doing all in their power to restore prompt
communication with the outside world
and have already partly succeeded and I
am assured that within the next few days
normal conditions with reference to tel
egraphic communication will prevail. The
situation in Galveston has been in most
instances accurately reported and the dis
tress of the people 13 great. Galveston
and vicinity need at oAce the assistance
of all the people. Remittances of money
should be made to John Sealey. treasurer

afternoon at Sberman-Clay Hall to aid
the Galveston sufferers. The hall was
Ttindly lent for the occasion by Mr. Sher
man, Owens & Varney gave their services
toward advertising the affair and in
pplte of the short notice a large audience
greeted the two little Rirls, whose sweet
and thoughtful sympathy makes the Gal
veston fund $170 the* richer. k
The programme was a long and varied
one and little Karla made her first ap
pearance as a soloistâ as a programmed
soloistâ with much eclat. She played
the Field "Nocturne No. 1", and Durand's
"Concert Valse." The afternoon was also
nuwle the occasion for. the hearing of a
new duet by Paloma. "The Battle of the
Giants," an amusingly impressive affair,
but showing musical growth- even since
the "Yosemite Impromptu," which was
itself . considerably in advance of her
earlier work. Other numbers were
Bach's "Chromatic Fantaisie,"-."Schmet
terling" of Greig, "Liebestraum,'.' Llzst;
a Chopin^-."Impromptu" and a couple of
Scarlatti's. -._ -w .' , - Â¦Â¦:Â¦: -;

BODIES BURNED
WITHOUT ATTEMPT
AT IDENTIFICATION
C^ ALVESTOX, Sept. 15.-Every hour
brings Galvestoii nearer to nor
-â - mal conditions and the Improve
I ment of each day shows a decided
gain over tfce preceding. It will
bo weeks and possibly months before the
city will be in good running Shape, but
matters are fast rounding Into a condition
which, compared with the chaos in the
early part of the week, is comfort and
happiness.
The great immediate need qt the city
at present Is nione^y â not subscriptions,
hut cold, hard cash. It Is needed in every
direction and for a multitude of purposes.
.The most important of these Is to pay the
men. who are cleaning up the streets. Ad
jutant Scurry said: "I have not a dollar
to pay the men who are working in the
streets atl day long. I am not able to
say to a single one of these men, 'You
shall be paid for your work.'
"We must have this city cleaned up at
any cost and with the greatest possible
speed. If it Is not done with all haste
and at the fame time done .well, there
may bo a pestilence, and if it once breaks
out here it will not be Galveston alone
that will surfer. Such things spread and
It is not only for the sake oÂ» this city, but
for others outside of this place, that 1
urge that, above all things, we want
money.
".Of all the poor people here, not one has
anything. A majority of them could not
furnish a single room in which to com
menco housekeeping, even though they
had the money to rebuild the room. These
people have absolutely nothing except
what is given them by the relief commit
tee. They are In a condition of absolute
want, they iack everything, and save for
the splendid generosity of the nation they
would be utterly without hope."
The work of burning bodies is still going
on, they being hurried to fires as soon as
possible after being taken from the water.
AH of last night and all of to-day there
were numerous fires along the shore and
in every one of them were from three to
twenty bodies. There Is no longer the
slightest attempt at Identification. No
effort Is made to ascertain whether the
body is that of white or colored persons.
All of them have been so long in tho
water under a blazing sun that It would
be exceedingly difficult to determine the
identity of any body, unless by the cloth-
Ing, and In most cases the bodies are des
titute of garments.
"Pull them out of the water as soon as
possible and throw them Into the flames
as soon as taken from the water," Is the
order, and It Is effectually carried out.

If all women who ars suffering with any form of fomafe weakness would write to Dr. Hartman, Columbus
Ohio, and giv3 him a complete description of their symptoms and the peculiarities of their troubles, he wiir
immediately rapfy with complete directions for treatment, free of charge.
"Health and Beauty," a book written especially for women, sent fr&o by Or* Hartman, Columbus
Ghso. Â¦' .
A great proportion of women have some catdrrhal weakness which has been called by the various doctors
she has consulted by as many different names. These women have been treated and have taken medicines with
no relief, simply because the remedies ere not adapted to catarrh. It is through a mistaken notion as to the real
nature of the diseases that these medicines have been recommended to them.
Catarrh is' a very frsqusnt cause of that class of diseases popularly known as female weakness. Catarrh of
the pelvic organs produces such a variety of disagreeable and irritating symptoms that many people â in fad, the
majority of people â have no idea thai they are caused by catarrh.
The nerves furnish the force which.
makes the blood circulate. If the nerrea
be woak. or overworked or Impaired ia
any way, poor circulation Is thÂ« result.
"Several cases have come under my per-
sonal observation and I have been highly

Depression of the nervous system Is a

invigorates the system and produces reg-
ular sleep. It builds up the system run
down by overwork. -^.
"Weakness of the nervous system not
only produces catarrh of the mucous
membrane but also causes nervous pros-
tration in some cases, and different de-
srees of nervous debility, derangements
of the stomach, sleeplessness and tired
out- feelings. .

catarrh of the 6tom^ch will cure the same

Additional confirmation of this view is

LONDON, Sept. 15.â Lord Salisbury Is
back at his post. Sir Chlh Luh, the Chi
nese Minister, had a conference at the
FSrelgn Office yesterday with Lord Salis
bury. The United States, German,
French and Russian representatives were
also there, yet not one of the great Lon
don dallies has a word of editorial com
ment on the subject that is uppermost In
the thoughts of the world's diplomats. It
is a striking exemplification of how com
pletely befogged is the public of every
European nation with regard to the pur
pose of their representatives. The Asso
ciated Press, however, hears from circles
In close touch with the Foreign Office
that a definite exposition of the diplomatic
situation and the aims of the powers may
be expected early next week, together
with some inkling as to how It is proposed
to attain the objects In view, but that at
present the main point of discussion con
tinues to be the question whether the
powers shall or shall not evacuate Peking.
This, it is reasserted, is already provision
ally settled negatively by Great Britain
and Germany, -.vho are hopeful of gaining
the united adhesion of the powers to a
temporary postponement of the scheme.
In the opinion of diplomatists, the way
has been somewhat cleared for the ac
complishment of this by the recent notes
from St. Petersburg explaining that Rus

the meaning deduced from the text of the
original proposal, as Intimating that Rus

The Bcersen Courier, Boer.sen Zeitung
and Cologne Volks Zeitung express them
selves similarly.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns authoritatively, however,
that German Government circles have
been most agreeably impressed by the
manner in which the German loan has
been taken up in the United States.

Mlquel, the Minister of Finance, this
afternoon that he is highly delighted with
the success of the lean.
A London paper's statement that this is
only an installment of a total of 200,000,000
marks is disproved here.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press called the Reichsbank officials' at
tention to the statement and they refused
to deny it. A representative of Dr.
Miquel, however, emphatically denied It.
Dr. Miquel Informed him that the Im
perial Government's needs are eatlsfled
for the present. The Associated Press In
formant also contradicted the statement
from New York that part of the loan will
be placed in Germany.
It 13 understood that the German Gov
ernment's motive In placing the loan in
America was the Berlin high financiers'
dissatisfaction, because the Government
placed the 200,000 loan of 1899 through a
single bank.
The Government wanted to show high
financiers that It is independent.

GERMANY WILL
INSIST CHINESE
BE PUNISHED
Situation Deemed to Be
Highly Unsatisfactory
and Complicated.
BERLIN, Sept. 15.â The Chinese situa
tion is here deemed to be highly unsatis
factory and most complicated, though no
sensational events are immediately ex
j pected and isolated action upon the part
' of any one power is not anticipated. Ac
! cording to the opinion here all the inter
j etÂ»ted powers are too tirmly convinced of
j the importance of continued harmony and
solidity to jeopardize them when no ne
cessity calls for It. It is expected in
Berlin that neither Russia nor France
will withdraw their troops hurriedly from
Peking and it Is believed the United
States will not be in any greater hurry.
Information has reached this city that
Russia- in any event, will keep large
bodies of troops in China, not only in the
frontier provinces of Mongolia. Manchuria
; and Kirin, but also in the interior and
; the coast districts of Pechili. The mili
jtary commanders of thtK allied forces
have agreed that under the circumstance*
it is necessary to strengthen the tactical
j and etrateeical position of the interna
! tional forces in Pechili. Russia, too will
finish the railroad from Yanytsu to Pe
! king.
Demands Punishment.
j Regarding Germany's attitude she will
in any case Insist on severe punishment
being inflicted on the treacherous Chinese
authorities, to which purpose the confea
! sion of Baron von Ketteler's assassin
came opportunely. Germany will not ac
cept Yung Lu as a peace negotiator if
the charges made against Yung Lu that
he led the attack against the Peking lega
tions are Proved. But Germany, although
her Foreign Office insists on the principles
of severe punishment, does not oppose
peace with China, as shown yesterdav by
Dr. Mumm von Schwarzenstein. the Ger
man Minister to China, accepting Li Hune
Chang's visit at Shanghai. 5
The German papers are filled with mall
correspondence from China, mostly de
scribing in detail events until shortly be
fore the march upon Peking. AH the lot
ters agree in caying that Germany was
the only power not permitting looting and
maintaining the strictest discipline amone
her troops.
Object to the Loan.
The pspers to-<3ay nearly all condemn
tho placing of the German loan in the
United States, as calculated to humiliate
the nation.

DIIILADELPHJA. Sept. 15. â The
much-talked of strike of the an-
I thracite mine-worUers In the coal
I regions of Pennsylvania, under the
._ auspices of the United Mine-Work
ers of America, and which affects about
145,000 union and non-union workers, was
practically begun to-day and reports re
ceived from tha various sections indicate
that on Monday morning, when the strike
officially begins, according to the strike
order issued by President Mitchell of the
Mine-workers' Union, very few of the col
lieries will be in operation. Just how
many men will obey the strike order can
only be conjectured. The union officials
steadfastly assert that all the union men
will remain away from work and will be
further strengthened by a large majority
of the non-union men.
The operators, on the other hand, are
confident that the proportion of striking
miners has teen greatly exaKgerated.
Monday morning alone can tell which is
correct.
The situation to-night is practically one
of strike. Reports from I-uzerne. Lacka
wunna, SehuyikiU, Carbon and Northum
berland counties, where the itio^t impor
tant coal workings are, presage a strug
gle between the operators and their men
that many frar may lead t r > disturbance
and perhaps worfc. The men in several
collieries In Luzerne to-day decided to
continue work for ten days longer be

years ago to discuss all grievances with
the company and allow ten days in which
to effect a settlement on all points of dif
ference.
To-nisM all is quiet. Miners' meetinors

speakers counseled quiet, orderly conduct
on the p::rt of the men. That some of

WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â Earnest
hopes are expressed by the officials of
the administration that striking coal min
ors will not attempt to interfere with the
United States mails or Interstate traffic,
but the War Department officials say
that if it becomes necessary the Presi
dent will take measures to insure the
proper observance of Federal laws.
The possibility of such an emergency
has directed attention to the number of
troops available for service in case the
strike should assume such proportions as
to make it dangerous to Federal interests.
All told, there are only 10,000 men in the
United States proper, or (WOO less than
during the Chicago strike. These troops
arc scattered in small detachments at
popts all over the country, and to get a
respectable force together it would be
necessary to mobilize 1 many detachments.
No reinforcements can be withdrawn from
any American dependency.

NEW GERMAN MINISTER
VISITS LI HUNG CHANG
PEKING, Sept. 7 (via Taku. Sept. 13 and
via Shanghai. Sept. 15).â At a meeting of
the Foreign Ministers here it has been de
cided that they have no power at present
to treat with Prince Ching. The generals
of the powers also think they cannot
treat with the Prince. The Russian lega
tion, it is understood, aas been ordered to
be withdrawn, and this is believed to In
dicate that the future of China must be
decided by an international committee in
some foreign capital.
Sir Robert Hart, the director of the
Chinese Imperial maritime customs, has
informed the foreign generals that they
must be prepared for future hostilities;
that the Chinese troops are concentrating
and moving on the line of communica
tion between Peking and Tientsin, arid
that it is thought trouble may be looked
for in November.
General Chaffee believes he has suffi
cient troops to hold out agrainst any at
tack.
Minister Conger has received reliable
news to the effect that all Americans at
Paoting-Fu have been killed. It is be
lieved that eignt missionaries were there.
Prince Ohing informed Minister Conger
that the Emperor Is to return to Peking
and make all proper preparations. The
Prince says the Emperor and the entire
court are in small villages sixty miles
away. He will not endeavor to neg-otlate
until the arrival of LJ Hung Chang, who
is expected here shortly.
Lieutenant Benjamin Hyar, command
ing sixty men of the Sixth Regiment, was
recently attacked near here by 500 Box
ers. He put them to rout, his force kill
ing twenty-five and capturing some rifles
and treasure. There were no American
casualties.

RUSSIAN AND JAPANESE
ARMIES IN CHINA AT ODDS
LONDON', Sept. 15. â Lord Robert9 re
ports to the War Office under date of
Machadodorp, September 14, as follows:
"French occupied Barberton yesterday
with the cavalry which he took across the
mountains. He met slight opposition, the
enemy being completely surprised. Twen
ty-three officers and fifty-nine men who
were prisoners were released and forty
three locomotives and other rolling stock
were captured. The former will relieve
us of great difficulty, as we had to put
up with a few rickety engines.
"French reports that he has sufficient
supplies for tnree weeks for his force and
for a week for his horses. One hundred
Boers, with many Mauser rifles and a
quantity of ammunition, were captured.
'j.here are large quantities of cattle and
sheep in the country, which Is good news.
"French intercepted large convoys,
showing that Barbtrton was used as a de
pot of suplies for the Boers in the south
and southeast. The bulk of French's
force is still thirty-rive miles behind the
cavalry, owing to the difficulty of getting
the wagons over the pass leading to Bar
berton.
THE HAGUE, Sept. 15.â The Boer dele
fates, Messrs. Fischer, Wolmarens and
Vessels, have addressed an appeal to all
nations for intervention in South Africa.
After expressing the conviction that the
annexation of the Transvaal was only
proclaimed with the object of enabling
Great Britain to prosecute the war in an
inhuman manner, contrary to interna
tional law and to mercilessly pursue as
rebel9 exhausted combatants heretofore
recognized as belligerents, the appellants
declared -that with God's help this will
never be attained. They assert that the
South African republics have shown them
selves to be worthy of liberty and that
they will continue to struggle to the last
breath against Great Britain's attempt to
annihilate their existence as a free peo
ple. The appeal concludes as follows:
"In the name of Justice and humanity
we appeal to all peoples to come to our
aid in this supreme moment and save our
country. We commit ourselves to God,
trusting that our prayers will be heard."

American Trade.
President Kruger's arrival at Delagoa
Bay will suffice as a basis for the British
Government to assert that the war Is over
and the Conservatives will appeal to a
presumed grateful nation on what is
known here as the "khaki issue"â in
other words, the military issue. There is
keen and increasing activity everywhere
on both sides, but even the stanchest
party newspapers admit that the Liber
als will enter the struggle leaderless and
disunited and in a general state of confu
sion practically precluding success. To
add to the misfortunes of the Liberal
party, physicians have peremptorily or
dered John Morley. on account of throat
trouble, to refrain from all speech-making
for several months. The Liberals thus,
on the eve of election, are deprived of the
services of one of their most able orators.
James R. Keene, who sailed for the
United States to-day, said to a represent
ative of the Associated Press: "I have
had a long summer's relaxation from busi
ness and am going home confident that
after the campaign In the United States
commercial affairs will experience a pe
riod of great prosperity. I have talked
with President Cassatt and many other
Americans and Englishmen, and all weie
of the same belict that there Is practi
cally no limit to the possibilities of Ameri
can tratio in Europe. We have so much
to sell and can sell so cheaply that there
seems to be no branch of trade in which
we will be unable to compete. I believe
this includes coal, though, of course, there
is a lot of humbug circulating about the
amount of transactions already accom
plished. The scarcity of English labor,
due to the men being absent at war. com
bined with the scarcity of ships due to
the same cause, has enabled mine-owners
to advance prices, and in due time these
conditions will be modified. But England
will have to keep a large standing army
in South Africa, and this will require
transports. So, until new ships are built,
the present conditions will largely pre
vail, enabling the United States to obtain
a permanent footing in the market.
"My racing experience has been pleas
ant, but we have little preference between
England ard the United States. We in
tend to send more horses. Racing Is more
of a snort in England and more of a busi
ness in the United States. But it is inter
esting in both places."
Journalists in Session.
The conference of the Institute of Jour
nalists, held in London during the present
week, under the auspices of Lord Mayor
Newton, passed a number of remarkable
resolutions, the results of which are
awaited with a great deal of curiosity.
For instance, hereafter if the dictates of
the Institute are obeyed, editors must re
frain from invltlns contributions from
persons of wealth, position, society, etc.,
because they thus deprive of valuable
space those who are Journalists by profes
sion and have no other means of liveli
hood. It was resolved also to form a com
mittee whese duty Is to investigate
charges against papers manipulating
items of news or unduly expanding cable
grams. Another committee was appointed
to draw up a scheme for the examination
of all persons aspiring to a newspaper ca
reer.

Canadian Mining Engineer Talks of
the Golden Klondike.
i Pr-ecial Dispatch to The Call. â¢
VANCOUVER. B. C. Sept. 15.â W. A.
Rauer, C. E. M. K., who has been in every
mining camp of great importance in the
world, has just returned from the Klon
dike, where he has been surveying within
a radius of loo miles all around Dawson
for British-American and other l>le; cor
porations. Mr. Bauer Fays that at some
remote age tne entire Klondike was low
lying: then' the alluvial deposits were
made. Subsequently a volcanic upheaval
' took place and the. golden sands were
I carried 1000 feet up to the mountain tops.
; He said he found water-washed gravel
: within a radius of 100 miles around Daw
' son rlKht up to the watersheds. He said
! that the creeks would bo done for in a
; few years, but that the hill- and bench
! claims wore richer than the creeks, tbe
I 250-foot claim on Gold Hill being undoubt
; edly the richest in the world. .
He gave It as his opinion that the oos
; slbilities in placer mining and dredging
' on all large rivers were vast; that the
1 country had only been scratched here and
i there, and that the Klondike's golden fu
j ture would be far more marvelous than
i her golden past, for he believed that hun
1 drt-ds of miles of water-washed gravel
! from the valleys to the mountain tops
would, If properly worked under changed
! laws encouraging development, prove
! profitable to the investor. Mr. Bauer said
â¢ that whole creeks without a single shaft
sunk had reverted to the Government
j through the owners stampeding elsew-here
1 and abandoning their claims, and there
would be hundreds of good claims sold at
auction, like a pig in a poke, for a few
1 dollars. .

pilation of the gold clean-up from the

A sad incident in connection with the
drowning is the fact that Mr. Kent was
to have been married next month to a
young Sacramento lady. Doane and Kent
were both here for the Jubilee celebra
tion and their friends were shocked when
the news of the disaster reached here.
Both men were buyers of produce and
fruit and spent nearly all their time on
tho rivers. In their gasoline launches
they visited all the ranches and bargained
with the farmers for their crops. Both
"The river at the point where the dis
aster occurred is 250 yard3 wide. Before
the collision our watchman and two of
the deck hands were standing forward on
the Dauntless and yelled out to the men,
but they paid no attention. The launches
each looked to be about thirty feet long."
"Just about this time I heard some one
shout: 'Look out. Jack! For God's sake.
Jack, go the other way.' The Dauntless
was now hard up against the bank, but
tho launches came on and struck us just
forward of the gangway on the starboard
side. The two launches were lashed to
gether and went down together. Wo got
a boat out in three minutes and searched
for three-quarters of an hour, but not a
trace of the men could be found.
"We were coming down the San Joaquln
River, after calling at Valentines. It was
11:10 p. m.,.a.nd we were about a mile
above what is known as Central Landing,
when I sighted a green light on the star
board bow. I made it out to be a gaso
line haunch and blew two whistles. I put
the helm to starboard and then, getting
no answer to my signals, I stopped the
engines and then went full speed astern.
The steamer Dauntless, that was in col
lision with the gasoline launches Friday
night." on the San-Joaquin River, arrived
at San Francisco yesterday. The steamer
at the time of the collision was in charge
of the pilot. Captain D. H. McNeil. Cap

TWO FATAL ACCIDENTS
OCCUR NEAR DUNSMUIR
Instead of going toward the shore he,
doubtless fearing that the steamer would
run him down, swam toward tho center
of the river, right into the current. Pilot
McNeill was at the wheel at the Uqjq.
Kyewitnesses declare that after the
Dauntless whistled "for sides," giving the
signal that it would take the bank, the
launches, that were provided with whist
ling apparatus, answered and made as
though to take the open water. Suddenly
Doane, who was handling the forward
launch, changed his course, standing in
for the shore. Kent, who was in the rear
launch, seeing the danger, jumped to save
himself.
At the local ofllce of the Union Trans
portation Company here it is claimed that
tho accident was due to tho fact that
Doano, who was In charge of the towing
launch, lost his head or the control of
his boat.
The unfortunate men havo been located
at Valentine, Staten Island, for some time
in the capacity of fruit buyers for the
firms they represent. They have gaso
line launches at their command, and yes
tirclay Kent broko down at Bouldln. He
sent a telephone message to Doane, who
was â¢ at Valentine, asking him to come
down and give* him. a tow. Doane re
sponded, and the tw# boats, Doane's lead
ing, had just Started from Bouldln when
the accident occurred.
The Dauntless finally continued on her course
to San Francisco after it was landed at Bould
in. J have been endeavoring to recover the
bodies, but have been unable to locate them
uy to an early hour this morning, and have
xviit to Stui'kton for assistance. 1 also desire
to offer a reward for the recovery of the bodies.
My private opinion is that the accident was
due to the carelessness of the pilot. In the
tirst place he had no right to hug the Bhoro,
and 1 am satisfied that, had he stopped the
wheel and reversed the engines, the accident
could have been avoided.
I left Stockton last evening on the eteamer
Dauntless Tor Kan Francisco. As the steamer
neared Iiouldin the pilot noticed two gasoline
launches coming upstream. They had u light
out, and one wuh towing the other. The ste-amer
pilot whistled for tho boats to ko to the right,
but they went to the left, however, crowding
close to the bank. The steamer aleo went in
close to the bank with the result that the
launches were run down and tunk. There was
a treat deal of excitement. Doane and Davis
went down immediately, but Kent, as many
of the passengers will testify, was alioat for
at least lilteen minuteÂ« and yet the crew of
the steamer did not get out a boat in time to
Have him. They had plenty of time to do so,
had they gone about it properly, and the paÂ«
sfiieers were loud in their condemnation of
th>Â» crew for their lack of drilling and dis
cipline. The teneral impression among rae
pasnengers was thut Mr. Kent could have been
saved had prompt measures been taken to get
out a boat. An it was, Mr. Kent ilnally went
down, exhausted with his etlorts to keep afloat.
W. S. 1 Broadgus of Henderson, Brown
& Co.. who was an eyewitness to the
accident, telephoned the following facts
this morning:
Doane was an agent of Wood, Curtis &
Co., produce men of Sacramento, and
Kent represented Henderson, Brown & Co.
of the same place. Davis was also known
in the capital city. Both men had naphtha
launches in which they went up and down
the river to purchase island products.
Last evening they had come from Valen
tines Landing and were ne*arlng Central
landing on Bouldln Island when suddenly
the Dauntless steamed around the bend
and gave a warning, two whistles, as she
passed into the new channel.
Kent's launch had become disabled and
was being towed by Doane's, all three
men being in the forward craft. The
Dauntless pilot, seeing the boats, tried to
swing the steamer toward the shore.
Kent was heard to cry, "For God's sakt..
Jack, what are you doing?" evidently
thinking that Doane was not making the
right move to escape a collision. In leÂ»s
time that it takes to tell it the steamer
had struck and overturned the launches
and Doane and Davis were seen trying to
get out from under the. awning, but it
held them, and the churn of the wheel
sent the capsized craft down under the
steamer's hull. Kent jumped from the
launch and struck out for the open water.
He could be seen struggling and his fran
tic cries for help could be heard. The
passengers threw out life preservers,
chairs and bo*<ep, hoping to aid him. but
when a boat reached the spot Kent had
disappeared. A rapid search was made
of the vicinity, but no survivor couid hi
found.
Two launches collided with the steamer
Dauntless at 10 o'clock last night and the
occupants were thrown, into the stream.
By the searchlights whiehr were thrown on
the scene the horrified passengers on tho
steamer witnessed the futile and frantic
t fforts of the men to keep afloat till a life
boat could reach them.

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 13.â The forty-
Feventh annual State Fair closed In a
blaze of glory to-r.'.ght. It was an un

the largest held in the State for many
years.
One of the elements that helped to make
the fair a success was the Citizens* Slate
Kair Club of this city, which provided
a series of interesting entertainments for
the pavilion nightly. The directors of the
State Agricultural Society feel that they
did all within their power to give a fair
that would be satisfactory to the people
of the entire Stau-, and that they suc
ceeded In doinsr fo against great odds.
The exhibits in the pavilion were of a

VALLEJO. S<Â»pt. 15.â On the request of
the Sheriff of Riverside County, Chief of
Police Stajidford has arrested J. C. Car
ter (colored) for a felony committed four
ifo. years s*o.
coup Is charged to that meeting.
Yesterday Henry Una rented the old
club building of Agent Hawkins for $3 a
month and paid three months' rent In
advance. He stated to the unsuspecting
Hawkins that he was going to start a
"public reading-room" In the town. Last
night Directors Seely, Wosser and Ahern
rented the place from Lessee Una and, en
listing the services of Expressman Lewis,
the schoolroom paraphernalia was brought
from the warehouse and placed in the
rented quarters. An armed guard 'was
left in charge for the night.
This morning, before the Directors had
thrown out their skirmish lines, Mrs.
Valentino arrived on the scene and openeJ
hostilities. A boy janitor named Kaller.
who was sweeping the place, fled through
a window. Director Seely. supported by
Carpenter John Hahlr, rushed to the fray
and commenced bolting the desks to the
floor. Mrs. Valentine, finding herself over
matched, executed a masterly retreat un
til reinforced by Agent Hawkins and staff,
when she returned to the assault, vowing
an Immediate and forcible ejectment.
Seely and Hahlr barricaded themselves In
the building and, armed 'with clubs, held
their besiegers at bay. The noise of
angry voices brought almost the entire
population of Belvedere to the scene.
Tiburon was all there. Every parent on
the island took sides with the besieged
Director and victory perched upon the
banner of education.
Mrs. Valentine upbraided the Directors
for forcing their tenantcy upon her and
intimated that they would remove sooner
than they wished. The school forces were
not idle, and the glories of the public
school and the benefits of education were
exploited.
To-night the tramp of two armed guards
may be heart* within the building, while
on the porch across the way Sam McDon
ough softly fiddles "There'll be a hot time
In the old town to-night."
Just where the matter will end is not
known. It is probable that the courts will
be called upon to decide the case.

LONE ROBBER
LOOTS A STAGE
Hold-Up on the Downieville
Road, in Which an Editor
Is the Only Loser.
The robber was as cool as a January
dav. He requested the editor to get back
into the stage and toM the driver to wblp
up. The last view of the robber was as
he disappeared behind the bnish, lugging
the empty box on his shoulder. The
Sheriff was notified as soon as the stage
reached a telephone station.
Then the "gentleman of the road"
stepped forth. He was clad In overalls
and had sacking wrapped about his feet.
A barley sack, with slits, constituted his
mask. At hi, .irder the driver threw
down the Wells Fargo box, but was dla
creetly silent aix.ut the iron chest under
his feet. Then the passenger Â¦was asked
to step out an-J part with hi3 wealth and
the editor turned over the $30.
It was this afternoon that the four
horse stage left thi3 city bound for Dow.
nleville. In the Iron chest, bolted to the
bottom of the stase, reposed a goodly
treasureâ all in shining gold. In the stagÂ©
reposed \V. F. Eschbacher, editor of the
Downfeville Messenger, and $30 clinched In
his "inside pocket," and he was still
dreaming on the beauties of the
Native Sons' celebration, for he
had - been to the city to see the
sights. The stage jolted along until it
reached the grade, a mile and a half
above Nigger Tent, twenty-seven miles
from here. Suddenly there came from
the shrubbery the cry so familiar to the
old stage-drivers. "Halt!" was the com
mand, and the driver. L. L. Gaffney.

inviting barrels of a shotgun.

STOCKTON*. Sept. 1j.â Was the letter
In the postoSice at Tracy, addressed to
James Mahony, withdrawn by some one
unauthorized to receive it? If so, the ob
ject was to iii.o from the officers a pos
sible clew to the secmins Impenetrable
rsystery suxrouEdlr.gr the violent death of
the your.jj Â£uc Franciscan. There is just
a faint suspicion by those who have been
following uie case that such may have
been true. As will be recalled, the ofll
cers searching: for clews to the mystery
located a letter In the postoftice of the
railroad town addressed to â¢'James Ma
hony." The presence cf the letter wai
made public through the papers and Sher
iff bibiey went over to Tracy to ascertain
tynether or not the party addressed was
oeceased. The story went that another
James Mahoay had called and claimed the
letter, giving a satisfactory explanation
as to his right to it. Now comes a sec
ond report that no Mahony called at all.
but that a man In I^athron cot a news
egent to go to the Uracy postoffice and
have the letter Eent over to him. at that
point.
The question arises. Was the man named
James Mahony or was it some one inter
ested in keeping the officers in the dark
and who. s-eei.is: in th^ papers that there
was a letter in Tracy supposed to have a
b^arinjr on the case, took this method of
heading- off the Investigation?
Of course, the withdrawal may have
boon regular and r>y a genuine James Ma
hony, as the dead and the live one have
D^rn mixed several times. It is undtrstood
that the iK^tmaster still Insists that a
man rarm-d Mahony. lesernbling the de

Sheriff Sibley is in this city Investi
gating- the death of Mahony. His Inquiry
is about complete anU he will depart for
his home to-day. The officer, while he
adheres to the accident theory is still
energetic in satherinij every particle of
evidence which would tend to throw any
light on. the affair. As he expresses it.
if there has been a crime committed he
wishes to know it and will leave no stone

While in this city thÂ« Sheriff Interviewed
the relatives ard friends of the deceased.
He discovered that Mahony was last seen
here en the Friday night preceding- the
Monday on which his death occurred.
Where he went no one seems to know, but
as he was at one time employed in the
vicinity of Stockton It is believed that
h*Â» w*nt to visit old acquaintances. The
Sheriff is convinced that the man had

The trial is set for September 24. but it is

"And I further say I had not until this

residences of said Alfred Ziegler and
Paris Zie-sler, although I have been since
my incarceration in said jail diligently
endeavoring to do so."
"I am the defendant In the above named
case. I am now confined in the County
Jail at the city of Santa Cruz and am
awaiting my trial for murder. I have en
tered my plea of not guilty to the charge
and an issue of fact has been joined In
this cause My defense in this case is
insanity. Alfred Ziegler and Paris Zieg
ler are material witnesses for my defense,
without whose testimony I cannot pro
ceed to trial. Both of said Alfred Ziegler
and Paris Ziegler reside outside the State
of California, to wit, in the city of Phila
delphia.
"liy the testimony of said Alfred Ziegler
and of said Paris Ziegler I will prove that
my mother died Insane and that my
brother, David Ziegler, died of epilepsy in
an asylum for the insane, being at the
time of his death confined in such asylum
as a patient, and I do not know of any
other witness or person by whom I can
prove such facts.

SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 15.-There was a
battle royal at Tiburon this morning. It
was a battle of words â warm, sizzling
words that flowed from unbridled tongues
in a tempest of sound and fury. It was
a battle in the cause of education, and
the victory perched on the banners of
those who stand for learning and culture
In the wilds of Tiburon. :-V^.'-
Combatants In the fray:
Attacking forceâ Mrs. T. B. Valentine,
supported by Agent James Hawkins.
Defenders â Janitor Faller (routed early
in the conflict); School Director Seely, re
inforced by Carpenter John Hahlr. and
later by all the parents resident In Tibu
ron. -..V'
The trouble is one of long standing. It
arose about a year ago over the old Ath
letic Club building, .where the town school
wus conducted last year and where it
will be conducted this year, unless the
law sides against the teaching of youth.
The building Is owned by Mrs. T. B.
Valentine and James Hawkins is her local
agent. For a time last year Mrs. Valen
tine allowed the use of the building rent
free to the School Directors, but toward
the end of the tenantcy the Directors
agreed to pay $12 per month. Here is
where the trouble commenced. The Direc
tors claim that Airs. Valentine presented
them with a bill for the full time the place
was used as a school. A portion of the
bill was paid, but the school was removed.
The desks and other paraphernalia were
taken to the railroad warehouse and the
children were turned loose in the chapar
ral of Belvedere Island to await the time
when a new school building might be con
structed.
A site was selected and on numerous
occasions during the past year the clink
of the carpenter's hammer on Lyford Hill
reminded the people of Tiburon that their
little schoolhouse was being built. Last
Thursday, however, the people grew rest
lees when it became known that it would
take three months to complete the build
ing and School Directors J. J. "Wosser. J.
B. Seely and William Ahern were called
upon to provide school accommodations
by Monday next.

FACIKIC GUOVE, Sept. 15.â So much
woik is to he done by the members of the
California Methodist Episcopal Confer
ence, row in annual session in this city,
that there is little time for the usual
gossip regarding appointments, but some
rumors are afloat that are causing no lit
tle interest.
AmoiiB these reports, one of especial in
terest is that Dr. John A. B. "Wilson of
the Howard Sticet Methodist Church 01
San Francisco is, by his own wish, to be
transferred, but whether to some other
metropolitan church or to take chargre of
a district as presiding elder, is yet un
settled by the gossips.
F. K. Baker, one of the young men of
the conference, who has returned to ser
vice after BeVKral years of study In thÂ»
Kast and Kurope, is spoken of as the
probable successor of Dr. W. S. Urmy at

A FABLE FOR LAZY GIRLS.
A good story is told of two Oxford un
dergraduates touring in tho East, who
entered the shop of a Jew whose knowl
edge of English, though he spoke most,
other tongues, was limited. With the cus
tomary carelessness of the Anglo-Saxon
race when abroad, one undergraduate re
marked to the other, on falling: to make
the Jew understand what he wanted, "The
fool does not speak English!"
This remark came within tho radius of
the old Jew's comprehension, and drew
from him the following questions:
"Do you spik Italian?" to which they re
|'Do you splk Grikr*
"Do you splk Turk?"
"Do you spik Spanish?*
"Do you spik Russian?"
After a pause the old man, with conBld
erable energy, ejaculated: "Me one times

discomfiture of the young man.â Tit-Bits

WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY f.GAIN.
ONE more test has been made by the British
Admiralty of the Marconi system of wireless
telegraphy, and again the test has resulted in
demonstrating the success and practical utility of the
invention. The trial was made between Portsmouth
and Portland, a distance of sixty-five miles, and the
test was the more severe because between those
points there intervenes St. Albans Promontory', rising
high above the levels at which the messages were
transmitted and received.
So thoroughly satisfied were the British officers
with the results that they at once ordered the installa
tion of the system on thirty-two warships, and it is
said will also have the system installed at all the land
stations of the kingdom. That, of course, is but a
beginning, for eventually every ship in the navy and
every important station in the empire will be provided
with the new means of telegraphy.
It is to be noted that Marconi's agents offered to
prove the system capable of overcoming an cvcji
severer test. They claimed to be able to transmit mes
sages over a distance of eighty-six miles, no matter
how many mountains or cities intervene. In'fact. one
of them in an interview with a correspondent of the
London Chronicle said: "Three years ago the great
est feat was nine miles, but now we hope to double
eighty-six miles in a very short time. It is obviously
a great advantage for ships to be able to communicate
with one another eighty-six miles apart, but it must
be of still greater use to extend the distance to 150
miles. The limit of possibility in this direction is as
unknown as discoveries in any other branch of elec
trical science."
The expectation of an early achievement of teleg
raphy without wires over a distance of 150 miles may
seem oversanguine, but it must be borne in mind that
what has been done within the last three years affords
a solid ground for entertaining such a hope. It is
hardly more than a year ago when the Examiner
mocked at the feat of The Call in procuring the an
nouncement by wireless telegraphy of the arrival of
the transport Sherman with the California Volun
teers. A little later, when, in connection with the
New York Herald, The Call obtained reports of the
international yacht race by wireless telegraphy across
twelve miles of sea. the Examiner again ridiculed the
invention, denounced it a fake and called the inventor
"Macaroni." Now ths system transmits messages for
PROTECTION AND PROGRESS.
] JNDER the title "Protection and Progress" Mr.
1 j John P. Young, editor of the Chronicie, has
contributed to the economic literature of the
time what in many respects is the ablest exposition
yet made of the advaniages to the world of the pro
tective system of promoting the industrial develop
ment of a country. The work is much more than an
economic treatise, since it deals with the subject
under ail its aspects, political and sociological as well
1 : idustrial, and presents a comprehensive study of
the cor.tru^s between protection and free trade as
a::vctinfr the welfare of the world, not only in our
own time, but in the future as well.
At the very opening of his book Mr. Young points
our that his object is to combat the erroneous idea
that the one object of the protective policy is to as
sist in the establishment of a domestic manufacturing
in itwry. That in itself might or might not be good,
according to conditions under which the industry was
established, but Mr. Young holds that where the con
ditions are favorable The protective system should be
continued even after domestic industries have been
firmly founded, because the system tends to prevent
waste of energy and wealth in the transportation of
goods from one country to another, and results in
cheapening the production of all the necessities of
civilization, not in one country, only, but throughout
the world.
Mr. Your.g states the proposition broadly thus:
"It is the function of protection to destroy the arti
ficial advantages resulting from accumulations of
capital and those which result from prior occupation
of fields of industry. In performing this work pro
tection is gradually reducing the wastefulness in
volved in useless carriage. In this respect it presents
2 complete antithesis to free trade, which promote?
this sort of wastefulness by encouraging the unneces
sary hauling to and fro of raw and finished article.i.
The inevitable outcome of protection must be the cre
ation of many centers of industry instead of one or
two. The result of this practical conversion of the
whole world into a workshop will be an enormous
gain to mankind."
In maintaining his propositions Mr. Young makes
sn elaborate study of the industrial history of Great
Britain as an illustration of the effects of free trade,
snd the chapters dealing with that phase of the argu
trcnt are among the most interesting and instruc
tive in the work. By a severe and searching but im
partial analysis of the effects of free trade in Great
Britain, and the consequent lieavy annual exportation
of coal to earn.- raw rraterial and finished goods to
and fro across the ocean, it is shown that Great
liritain is even now verging upon a decline of indus
trial and commercial power because of the waste of
her coal supply.
Upon that point it is said: "If it is a blunder bor
dorint: on the criminal to heedlessly strip the earth
of its forests, which human care and energy may re-
More, what may we Â»all the unnecessary destruction
of the store of mineral fuel, which can never be re
placed? That is a question which will come home to
posterity, and when t|ic answer is framed it will eni-
Lrace an awful indictment against a false <Â»onomic
system which taught men to deliberately waste an in
dijpcnsable economic assistant provided by nature
which can never be replaced."
Ample statistics are cited to show the extent to
which the free trade waste is being carried on, and
then further proof is advanced of the advantages
which result from estcblibhing the factory near th^
field and the mine, so that no waste is entailed in
hauling goods from one place to another. Moreover,
it is pointed out that protection saves the workers of
a country from the excessive competition of other
lands :tnd thus directly tends to improve their con
citions and to advance them in all lines of human en-
As the issue between free trade and protection is
still a matter of controversy in our politics, the publi
cation of this book is timely from a poHtical as well
as an economic standpoint, and it merits the attentive
study of all thoughtful citizens. It is bound to have
s powerful influence on the public mind, and will take
high rank among the notable publications of the year.
A Galveston boomer says the storms there are no
worse than along the Great Lakes, and that if the
people build suitable houses everything will be safe
in future. He therefore advises young men to go to
Galveston and grow up with the town. The counsel
may not be good, but the cheerful vigor of the local
pstriotism displayed will appeal to many an Amen
can heart. That is the sort of stuff that builds up
cities, and if Galveston have much more like it her
future will be bright.

PERSONAL MENTION.
rROM Vermont comes this story: A farmer
offered his farm cf 300 acres for sale for $15,000,
but could find no one who would give him any
thing like that sum. Being hard pressed for money
he determined to sell the pine that was standing on
the place, and when it was put upon the market it
brought over $14,000. As that sum was larger than
any that had been offered for the whole place, the
former was surprised, and the fellows who had re
fused to buy were more surprised still. It was an
illustration that even in Vermont the shrewd men do
not always understand the value of things right under
their eyes. Commenting upon the sale the Boston
Globe says: ''The timber on many a New England
farm would sell for nearly as much as is asked for
the whole place, though the owner is often quite un
conscious of the facr."
Another illustration of the growing value of forests
is furnished in a recently published volume on the for
ests of Great Britain by John Nisbet. In reviewing
the work the London Chronicle says: "The present
area of woodlands in the British Isles is about three
million acres, and even this area is managed very in
differently, so that while the Belgian forests (1,750.000
acres), according to Dr. Nisbet, yield annually nearly
Â£4.000,000, and ours, if equally well managed, would
yield Â£7,000,000, they do not probably yield more than
one-fifth of this sum. So insufficient are our woo'd
lands for our wants that the value of the conife-ous
timber imported in 1899 was Â£21,000,000. Much of
this we could certainly grow on our own waste lands
and thus save our money and also provide a large
amount of healthy country labor. * * * He sup
plies some remarkable figures of the yield in the Earl
of Mansfield's woods at Scone, where the Douglas
fir, now seventy-five years old, is worth Â£194 an. acre,
besides having already more than paid for the cost
of planting and maintenance by the sale of thinnings.
He also cites the case of a large plantation in the Chil
tern Hills seventy years old that sold for Â£220 an
acre."
Timber is rapidly becoming a scarce product in the
world and forestry is going to be the grand farming
of the future. If in a country like Belgium a forest
can be made to yield annually an income equal to
about $10 an acre on a large scale, it is fair to assume
that in the United States on smaller and well chosen
areas the profits would be much larger. According
to a recent authority Germany has 10,000,000 acres of
state forests all upon land unfit for other purposes,
and derives from them an annual revenue of $23,000.
cco. That is not so good as the Belgian income, but it
is far and away better than the American method of
burning and wasting forests, and in California, at any
rate, we ought to profit by the lesson.
the' profits of forestry.

Mr. Miller has been pivinp the play for a |

played for a year in I<nndon by Mr. Mar
tin Harvey. Now, Mr. Colgate Baker
may, before the year 1S0S, have written
and published (or had acted) a play called
"The Only Way"; if so. he has as much
right to the title as Mr. Wills. If he i
wrote his play after the year 1S0S he
should not have taken Mr. Wills* title. In
any case, the statement that Mr. Baker j
"dramatized 'The Only Way,' the play '
which fascinated (?) San Francisco j
theater-jroers a short time ago," is a lie '
and should be branded as such. Mr.
Baker suffers from such a misstatement
even worse than does Mr. Wills. If the |
fellow who has been making it could be j
caught he should be straightway elevated |
to what Pope has happily called "a nitch i

The Rev. Madison C. Peters is a New
York clergyman of unusual originality
and power. He may not be an authority
upon Patristic Hierarchism and his
views upon that favorite topic of medieval
controversyâ "How Many Angels Can
Stand Upon the Point of a Needle"â may
be as hazy as are mine, but he has some
clear, modern ideas upon another topic â
"The Church and the Theater"â and he is
not afraid to express them. Here are a
few of the good sayings from an article
of his in the September Book "World:
"Let us bring the leaven of the gospel
into the amusement lump and teach the
people how to use amusements without
abusing them, and save the church from
her present humiliating attitude as the de
clared enemy of the drama, from attend
ing which ehe has no power to restrain
her members. â¢ â¢ â¢
"The pulpit's vituperation of the theatri
cal profession is so unchristian ag only a
clergyman, who never paw a pood play,
would ever dream of makincr. The stagi
seldom or never strikes back. The nu
merous scandals of the American clergy
men now serving terms in the various
penitentiaries of the land afford legitimate
material for the stage. â¢ â¢ â¢ Play
wrights and actors are not to blame fot
what we often f?et on the stage. The
Americans like slang and vulgarity. Play
wrights and actors do not live to write
and act: they have the bread-and-butter
human weakness ar.d write and act to
live. They know what the people want,
and they give it to them. The noble sen
timent raises feeble applau.se, but the
word that looks two ways, and the exhibi
tion of doubtful propriety brings all the
feet down ar 1 makes all hands clap.
The theater and opera will never in tone
and tendency be above the life that at
tends them. The demand will control the
supply. In nothing else do Americans
show so much bad taste as in their in
dorsement of plays \and players. â¢ â¢ â¢
"The church has made a tremendous
mistake in its wholesale denunciation of.
the theater. â¢ â¢ â¢ There b nothing in
the precepts of our religion which makes
us march down the path of life to the
tune of "The TJead ilarch in Saul." â¢ â¢ â¢
Mendelssohn, by his sublime composition:-,
did bt-ttef serve the world than by going
out as a missionary to China."

Japan has established commercial
schooH for the training of women, and
one of the larpest Japan railroads an
nounces that after a certain date It will
employ only women as clerks.
The movement is one which cannot be carried out
with success by, separate action of the storekeepers,
no matter how willing some of them may be to grant
the reasonable j request of their employes. Early
closing can be attained only by concerted effort. It
is therefore the more important that public sentiment
should favor and encourage the movement to that end.
It is not right that any class of people should have to
spend nearly all of their waking hours in the task of
earning a means of providing themselves with some
thing to eat and a place to sleep. An opportunity for
social enjoyment, for study and for recreation should
be found each day in the life of every man and every
woman.
The conditions under which retail trade is carried
en render it a somewhat difficult problem to limit
the duration of the working day. Stores must be
kept open for the benefit of customers, and the store
keeper must adapt his trade to the convenience of
the customers. It is an old saying, however, that
where there is a will there is a way, and all experience
has attested the truth of it. It is generally conceded
that clerks in retail stores have to serve excessively
long hours, and that some relief should be afforded
them. Any well devised plan for providing that re
lief will have the support of all reflecting people.
Virtually the whole community will unite in support
ing it.
OUT of the movement started by clerks in retail
stores in this city to obtain shorter hours of
labor it is to be hoped immediate good will
come for all concerned. One of the most notable
economic tendencies of the time is toward lessening
the pressure of toil upon all classes of workers. It is
not very long ago when almost all workers were
compelled to spend from twelve to fourteen hours a
day at their work. The improvement of machinery
has rendered it possible to do a given amount of work
in much less time than before, and consequently trade
after trade has succeeded in establishing a system of
work not exceeding ten hours, and in many trades
of only eight hours a day.

that in every Congress many of the delegation were
inexperienced men serving their first terra and having
no knowledge of either the men or the methods by
which Congressional business is carried on. Of the
Republican nominees this year a majority have al
ready served one or more terms in Congress. They
have acquired the experience which fits" them to be of
r?e to their State and their constituents. From the
standpoint of California's welfare, therefore, it would
be good policy even for Democmts to vote for the
Republican nominees and thus assure the State the
advantage of an experienced representation at the
national capital.
Finally it is to be borne in mind that many of the
Republican candidates have not only served in the
House but are now holding places on the most im
portant committees, and some of them are chairmen
of such committees. Consequently they are in posi
tion to materially advance and promote every interest
of the State. It would certainly be foolish to set aside
men who have high positions in the House for the
purpose of sending there men who would have only
the most subordinate places.
The fight for the House is to be waged by the
Bryanites with all their ardor and strength. Repub
licans should meet the onset with a resolute determi
nation to win every district. A' solid delegation from
California may be necessary to give the Republicans
control of the House, and it will certainly be neces
sary to subserve the interests of the State. Let Re
publicans and independents unite to make it solid.
r~\OLITICAL experts of all parties agree that the
k ' chief danger to the Republican party in this
campaign is to be found in the contests of the
Congressional districts. Notwithstanding the loud
claims of the Bryanites and the overconfidence of a
good many Republicans, it is recognized that Mc-
Kinley's re-election is as certain as any future event
subject to human action can be. The decrease in the
Republican vote in Vermont and Maine was due
solely to the fact that Republicans knew the victory
was theirs, and many of them therefore did not take
the trouble to go to the polls. With the advancement
of the campaign Republican ardor will be aroused
and there will be no falling oft from the vote that gave
McKinley all the hotly contested States in 1896. That
much is sure, but there is no surety of a Republican
majority in the House of Representatives.
Such being the case, the attention of the Repub
licans and the independent voters of California
should be turned at once to the campaign in the Con
gressional districts. California should send a solid
Republican delegation to Congress. Not a single ad
vocate of free silver ;-.r.d free trade and the "policy
of scuttle" in foreign affairs should be permitted to
go to Congress to misrepresent the sentiment of the
people and the interests of the State.
Since McKinley is sure to be re-elected it is of
high importance to place the House of Representa
tives under the control of the party that will support
his administration and enable him to carry out the
construction of the Nicaragua canal, the upbuilding
of 'our merchant marine, the regulation of trusts and
ether far-reaching policies which can be effected only
through legislation. If the Government be divided
against itself, there will be two years of party wrang
ling over great issues and hardly anything will be ac
complished. The public good demands that the
House of Representatives should be Republican. It
is therefore the duty as well as the interest of every
independent voter to act with the Republicans in the
Congressional districts to the end that the delegation
from this State may be solid for sound money and
protection.
Such arguments apply with equal force in every
Congressional district in the United States, but there
are certain conditions peculiar to this State which
render the election of Republican Congressmen of
exceptional advantage to us. It is well known that
California's interests at Washington have suffered
from the lack of experienced men to uphold them.
\Vhi!e the Eastern and the Southern States have kept
able men in the House term after term, so that they
might acquire influence and prestige there, Califor
nia in the past has changed her Congressmen so often
ThE FIGHT FOR THE HOUSE.
"Mr. Colgate Baker is a writer of ac
knowledged ability. It was he who dram
atized 'The Only Way,' the play which
fascinated San Francisco theater-goers a
short time ago."
It is time that somebody nailed this lie,
which from the form in which it has sev
eral times appeared seems to emanate
from some Grub-street syndicate writer
in New York. The intention is evidently
to boom Mr. Baker. If that young gen
tleman has a proper and modest estimate
of his own abilities â and I believe he has
âhe cannot do better than hasten to de
liver himself from his friends.
The play known as "The Only Way,"
' appointed directorâ that is, in 1869â
he published a hook of essays entitled
"Modern Life In the Drama," and in the
preface to that book laid down what he
considerod essential to the progress of the
stage. "The drama will be saved," he
wrote, "and will hare its due influence
on morals when authors, courageously
following a single path, despairing not
even after a check, shall impose upon
themselves the task of placing upon the
stage modern life with all its complica
tions, all its wants, all its sufferings." In
saying that it is especially modern life
in the drama that I have sought to study
I shall have characterized the criticism
that I have carefully attempted here.
Modern life! That is, this confused pe
riod wherein we wear ourselves out, this
stormy time, this night cut by lightning
strokes, these cares, these fears, these
hopes followed by exhaustion, these burn
ing or bleeding problems, cruelly compli
cated just as we think them solved, and
this melancholy of our day, this anaemia
and this neurosis, the two maladies of
the ageâ in a word, all this excess which
will mark with bizarrerle the transitional
period through which, protesting, we shall
have passed.
One might characterize these times, in
deed, in the burning phrase of Lamme
nais: "Those who saw them have related
that sadness was in their heart; anguish
rent their breast and, as if weary of the
toil of living, they wept."
It is these tears and this anguish that
I would see studied by our dramatic au
thors, and the day when a man of con
viction and of talent shall boldly paint,
without forethought of immediate suc
cess, of loud bravos or of pain, life, mod
ern life â that man, studying and drama
tizing social questions, living evils, act
ual griefs, will be truly a great man sim
ply because he will be true. His dramas,
instead of passing away like an Irides
cence of springtime whose color a sun
beam destroys, will stand, will endure,
will show to times to come what we have
loved, what we have longed for and what
we have suffered. "
When this was written M. Claretie could
hardly have dreamed that he would one
day be in a position to employ the re
sources of the first theater In the world
to stage the work of just such a writer
as he hoped for. Yet on the 17th of Jan
uary, 1&S7, he had the felicity of produc
ing Dumas' masterpiece, "Francillon," 'a
thoroughly modern play if ever there was
one, with Laroche. Febre, Bartet and
Relchemberg in the east. That was glory
enough for one administration had he ac
complished nothing else. For well has
Dumas himself said (Notes Sur Denlse):
"When civilization shall make up its ac
count, who knows but we shall perceive
that these amusers of multitudesâ these
amusers who can make known to us Cor
neille, Racine, Mollere, Beaumarchais,
Hugo, De Musset and othersâ have done
more for civilization than all the politi
cians who pretend to lead the world?"

As The Call was the first newspaper in the world to
apply wireless telegraphy to the uses of journalism, it
naturally takes a keen interest in the development of
the system, but the invention has now reached a de
gree of excellence that makes every further improve
ment in it a matter cf world-wide importance. It is
an old saying that nothing is invented and perfected
at the same time. When the work and the study of
many minds have brought something like perfection
to Marconi's invention it may prove so efficacious as
to enable us to do away with wires for telegraphic
purposes altogether.

a record of advancement he has reason at least for
believing that within a few years more he will be able
to double that distance.

<=jj=3HE modesty of Justice of the Peace Dunn was put to a. severe test
I yesterday when Mrs. Alice Mason, a fair defendant In a suit which
j! was on trial before him, volunteered to don a silk waist which Ehe
claimed did not fit her at all, and for the payment for which she had
been sued by M. Lowenthal, a ladles' tailor. Lowenthal brought the
suit against Charles Mason, the plaintiff's husband, and insisted on the pay
ment of $55, the value of the waist and a dress that went with it.
To Mrs. Mason's claim that the waist was a wretched fit, Lowenthal de
posed that after her measurement had been taken Mrs. Mason went on a
pleasure trip to some Eastern cities and that on her return she was sensibly
increased in weight. He attributed her stouter proportions to high liv
ing, and while he acknowledged that the waist might be a little tight, the
defect, he said, could be remedied.
It was then that Mrs. Mason made her offer to give ocular proof of her
contention that the waist did not fit.
"I am willing to put the waist on, bo you can see for yourself," she
tearfully said to Justice Dunn. The latter, who prides himself on his knowl
edge of feminine adornments, rapped for order as he blushlngly, though with
determination, said:
"That will be entirely unnecessary, madam," and the lady replied as a
light dawned upon her:
"Oh, I did not mean that I would put it on here, Judge, but I will come
attired in it if you postpone the case until to-morrow."
. Justice Dunn, however, ungallantly decided against the lady and gave
Judgment for the lady's tailor In the sum asked for. The case was then com
promised, Lowenthal agreeing to make the necessary enlargements in the
waist and Mrs. Mason to accept and pay for it on that condition.

linist's return from a long European
study will read with regret of his 4 sad
fate. Mr. O'Connell was -33 years old. and
his sad end was the result of overstudy
of his favorite instrument.

The MInetti String Quartet announces
its fifth season of chamber music con
certs, to begin at. Sherman & Clay's Hall
on October 5-i The first programme will
include a new Russian quartet, of Ippo
lltoff Iwanow, to be given for the first
time hero, and the Schubert C major
string quintet.

Miss Marion L. Boar' announces an in
vitational piano recital for Monday even
ing next, to be given in Sherman &.
Clay's Hall. A piano recital is also an
nounced Jor the following evening at the
same place by Miss Grace Barker Mar
shall, pupil "f Miss Elizabeth Westgate,
assisted by Bert Georges, Samuel Savan
nah, Arthur Fickenscher and Miss Estelle
Brun.
. * â¢ â¢ Â¦
Another interesting programme Is
promised by Miss Anna Miller Wood for
Thursday evening at Sherman & Clay's
Hall. This favorite contralto is well
known and much admired among San
Francisco audif-nces, and her first public
appearance for some time here will doubt
lrss be warmly welcomed among the mu
sicians.

The long-lost Azzali grand opera com
pany has at last been found and is now
in Mexico. It seems that their vessel was
detained by the storm which destroyed
ill-fated Galveston and serious fears were
entertained for their safety. â¢
The season will open at the California
Theater on Sunday evening, September 23,
and the sale of seats opens Thursday
morning at 9 o'clock. There will be four
operas given during the iirst week, all old
favoritesâ "Othello," "Carmen." "Aida"
and "Traviata"â and "Othello" has been
chosen to open the season. With Salassa's
masterly Iago still fresh in the memory,
musicians and actors alike are vastly
curious to hear the singer chosen for the
part in the Azzali company, and many
arc the prophetic comparisons made. Hut
the proof of the pudding is in the eating,
and we shall see what we shall see.
The solitary symphony concert above
referred to is a subscription affair and
will be given at the Tlyoli Opera-house
on Thursday afternoon, October 25, if the
necessary number of subscribers are
Ilnancially heard from. The concert will
be under the direction of Max Hirschfeld
and the orchestra will include sixty mu
sicians. Hector Berlioz's rarely heard
"Episode in the Life of an Artist." and
the "Kaiser March" of Wagner, will be
given among other things, and as this
may be the only symphony heard here
this season there should be no diiflculty
in the matter of subscriptions.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Among the week's concerts perhaps the
most interesting will be that of Miss Rose
itelda (Adler), which will be given in
Sherman & Clay's Hall on Friday even
ing. Miss Rclda is a California girl, -who
comes home, with a Parisian reputation
acquired in a season's successful appear
ances at the Opera Comique in the part
of Lakme. She is a pupil of Mme. Co
lonne, wife of the director of the Colonne
concerts, and while in San Kranciscu
studied with Miss Marie Withrow.
Miss Rclda is visiting her people at the
present time and will leave here for New
Vork early In October for a season Â¦with
the Savage-Grau forces at the Metropoli
tan Opera-house. She is billed to appear
there in "Migncn," "La Uoheme," "Ro
meo and Juliet," "Lakme" and as Mi
chaela in "Carmen." Her programme on
Friday evenine will include the "Bell
Song" (Lakme), "The Shadow Dance"
from "Dinorah," and "Le Cygne" (the
dying swan), a song of Lecocq's, which,
to secure the effect, is sung behind the
.scones. Miss Relda will be assisted by
Arthur Weiss and Miss Genevieve Alay
Moroncy.
Naturally enough, these conditions seem
to have roused the native musician to
â¢wider effort, but seldom, indeed, has the
evidence of a local musical activity been
more conspicuous than at the present
time. Song recitals, piano recitals, violin
recitals, chamber music concerts galore
are announced far into the winter months,
but nothing definite has yet been done in
the matter of symphony concerts with the
exception of a single tentative effort in
that direction at the Tivoli. It is to be
deeply regretted that the wide interest
aroused in this the highest form of mu
sical entertainment should be allowed to
die out. San Francisco has amply proved
during a number of intermittent attempts
at establishing a symphony society her
perfect willingness to support such, given
a worthy conductor and reasonable prices
of admission. It is also understood that
the financial backing of Mrs. Phebe A.
Hearst and other public-minded citizens
is still to be counted upon, and the lack
seems to be a strong committee of man
agement to handle the affair. It is early
yet to judge, though, and amply early to
hope for iurther developments.
*7\ JfUSIC is again in high season:
/A l\ the echo of the winter's melody
I V^ I lb again upon the ear, and to
V, * I judge by Its promise and
J^ prophecy we shall not lack the
merry madrigal nor yet the dance of vio
lins for inany months to come. It is true,
indeed, that the musical great ones of the
earth seem so far to have passed us by,
with tho eminently satisfactory excep
tions of the Grau contingent, in grand
opera, and the Graff forces, with Mme.
Serabrlch, but in the purely musical world
the season is notably empty. So far not
one great instrumentalist Is booked to
appear, and but few vocalists, among
them, however, the Henschels and Mile.

REV. H. H. WYMAN, superior Of the
Congregation of St. Paul, has been
superseded by Rev. Michael Smith,
C. S. P. The news of this change
will come as a surprise to the congrega
tion of St. Mary's (Paullst) Church and
the Catholic residents of San Francisco.
In discussing the change Father Wyman
said:
"I am happy to say that I believe I am
more responsible for the change than any
one else. For some months past I have
felt that I could do more good among the
people here if I had more time for spirit
ual work. If it will be the will of my su
perior general, I shall be only too happy
to spend the rest of my life in Laboring
for tho salvation of souls in old St. Mary's
Church and such places on the const as I
may lie sent on missions bv my superiors.
"I am certain that Father Smith is bet-
Rev. P. .1. MacCorry, the eloquent
young Paulir.t. who has charmed thou
sands in this State with his masterful
lecture entitled "The Story Beautiful,"
and who is conceded to be one of the
ablest preachers in the order, has joined
the Paulist missionary band in Chicago.
Rev. Michael I'. Smith, who is now in
the city, has been superior of the College
of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Paullst no
vitiate, which is affiliated with the Cath
olic University at Washington, I). C. He
will preach his first sermon at 11 o'clock
this morning.
ter Qualified than myself to hold the of
fice of superior, and 1 have no doubt that
under his able management our work in
this city and coast will receive a new im
petus."
Rev. Father Wyman has been pastor of
St. Mary's Church since the order was
established on the coast. His many
friends will be pleased to learn that he
will be retained here and will devote his
energies to the cause of local Catholics.
The annual report of the Minister of
Mines of British Columbia shows that the
mineral output of the province for the
year 1S99 was $12,308,131. as against $10 -
W6.S61 for 18'JS. an increase of $l,4S6,270 or
13 2-3 per cent. This would have b'een
largely increased but for the shutting
down of several mines, owing to the pas
sage of a law prohibiting miners working
over eight hours und*r drastic penalties
causing a deficit of $310,814 in silver and
lead values alone. The coal mines of the
province during 1899 turned out 1,306,324
tons of coal and 34,251 tons of coke, an ln-
Cttiflo over 1S9S of 170,459 tons of coal and
The. United States Supreme Court has
decided In the case of Black vs. The Elk
horn Mining Company that "the interest
in a mining claim prior to the payment of
any money for the granting of a patent
to tho land is nothing more than a right
to th*> exclusive possession of the land
based upon conditions subsequent, a fail
ure to fulfill which forfeits the locator's
interest in the claim." The language of
tbÂ° decision is in part as follows:
The Sorrento Coal Mining Company is
developing a ledge of graphite in Sonoma
County, south of Petaluma. The shaft
has been put down about 100 feet and a
well developed ledge is reported.
The quartz ledge in Black Canyon
Placer County, has been bonded to San
Francisco men, who will develop the
property. Many claims in the mountains
have been compelled to suspend, owing to
the scarcity of water. Preparations are
under way for resuming work on the Tad
pole Consolidated mine. The Pioneer
mine is about ready to start up. San
Francisco men have been looking into th P .
prospects of the Harney Consolidated
mine. An electric plant is being put up in
El Dorado Canyon for tho Turkey Hill
mine.
Mining machinery has been arriving at
Place-rville for the Mount Pleasant minÂ»
and also the rails for the Mount Hope
and Kimball gravel mines.
Several strikes are reported as having
been made in the placer mines near Bar
ptow. San Hernardino County. The forces
of employes have been doubled on some
of the claims.
According to the Yreka Journal the
dredger at llawkrnsville, in Yreka Creek
has been strengthened, but has had a
number of breakdowns. Several new
ledges have been located in tho Fool's
Paradise district.
In Amador County work is progressing
New hoisting machinery is being placed in
the South Eureka mine. Work at the
South Spring Hill mine is steadily going
on. The Kennedy mine at/Jackson will
be reinforced with more powerful hoisting
machinery. AV'ork will soon begin at the
Imperial mine on King's ranch, one mile
east of Sutler Creek.
The Calaveras County papers report
that Campo Seco is in the midst of a cop
per boom.
The Minors' Union has elected the fol
lowing officers at Grass Valley; Presi
dent. EJ G. Swift; vice presidents John G.
Terrill; financial secretary, M. M. Mitch
ell; recording secretary, Richard Gluyas;
trustees â Frank Williams and Joseph
Constantino.
The application for a patent for many
thousands of acres of land in Shasta, Sis
klyou and Trinity counties, which has
been made by the Southern Pacific peo
ple, has aroused the miners in those lo
calities. The Redding Searchlight says
that the miner? must, within sixty days
from August 10. prove their claims on
the lards in quc-Ftion or lose their rights.
Land Commissioner Hermann has im
posed rules which involve great hardship
in making proof. Th?se provide that the
affidavit of contest must be supported by
the affidavit of one or more witnesses;
that evidence cf the location of mining
claim and title thereto must accompany
tho protest; that it must bo set forth
what portion of the protested tract is
covered by the claim. The protest should
be supported by all tho evidence of which
the cape js capable, as good faith in the
protection of the interests of the claimant
must be shown. The third provision, that
one relating to furnishing a survey of the
lines of the claims, is the one must com
plained of by the miners.
The operations on the Colorado River
promise to be more extensive than was
originally reported. The Advance Go'il
dredging Company has completed its big
dredge, which is at Yurca, and will soon
be taken to the Potholes, where it will
operate. Prospectors are running drills
at the Potholes with results which they
have reported to be satisfactory. Arkan
sas capitalists are reported to have serur
ed an option upon 500 acres of placer
ground in the La guna section, owned by the
Yuma-Color&do Gold-dredging Company,
and have thirty days in which to examine
The bond is $20,000. The syndicate pro
poses to put a large dredger on the ground
if the prospecting shall prove to be satis
factory. Late in the fall an expedition
will leave Yuma to search for the "Lost
Frenchman" mine.
"For some time at least, but little min
ing machinery will be required, as much
ore can be collected from the rich surface
outcroppings and the larjreriron bodies uro
practically quarries, until the output h;is
reached 100,000 tons. It is probable that
these latter will require treatment on the
ground; the cleaner bomite ores can be
hand-sorted up to SO per cent and shipped,
but the remainder will require dressing up
to a fair grade to counterbalance the high
cost of suitable fuel. The season of - 1900
will probably decide most of the points at
issue."
A writer in the Eiigineerinjr and Mining
Journal, reviewing the "Wnit'e Horse cop
per belt in Alaska, Bays that two distinc
tive classes of ore are present. There are
large masses of specular or magnetic iron
carrying a moderate amount of copper;
also outcroppings of much smaller dimen
sions in which the ore is essentially bor
nite or with occasional patches of chal
copryte and green copper carbonates >:n
the condition of sand, or disintegrated
granular limestone tstained with copper.
Azurite is rare; chnlcocite and black oxitle
occur sparingly; bur native copper seems
to be absent, as well as the red oxkl<?.
The typical ore is bomite. Continuing, he
says:
Most of the copper mines of the Morenci
district represent what were originally
wildcat undertakings. The present hold-
Ings of the Detroit Company were located
by "wildcatters." When the properties
Eeemed to have value they were taken in
band by a Scotch company. This was
about lourtoen years ago. The mines
were operated at a loss until five years
ago. Something like MW tons of ore are
handled daily now. The Media Company
has in view the putting in of a smelter
on the San Francisco River.
ThÂ« search Tor new copper districts con
stitutes one of the signs of the times In
the mining industry. Sanguine predic
tions are continually made concerning: the
future of one or another district. ThÂ« in
creasing demand for copper to be used
in the application of electricity in multi
farious ways is making prospecting for
copper ores more and more necessary.
Shasta County. In this State, has made
large development of Its copper resources
In the last two years and other extensions
are projected. Other sections of the State
also have expectation of winning- large
returns from the red metal. In the mean
time the copper mines of Arizona are ex
ploiting their properties abroad. An East
em publication issued in Denver says that
the output of Arizona copper, amounting'
last year to $20,000,000 In value, will be
notably increased in the near future. The
plants of the Arizona Copper Company
and the Detroit Copper Mining Company
of Clifton and Morenci will be extended.
Is'eg-otiations are progressing to put in a
100-ton water jacket and condensers on
the San Francisco River to treat the ores
of the Shannon mine. The Arizona Cop
per Mining- Company, on the same author
ity, i3 reported to be producing about
J3.000.000 worth of copper bullion annually.
The United Verde, the greatest copper
producer in Arizona, will soon shut down
to give time for the renovation of the
plant and extension.

The reporters will investigate.
The name and address of each person receiving the treatment trill be carefully and
privately kept, reporters detailed to interview these persons and the results of this in-
vestigation will be published In the San Francisco newspapers. Heing Interviewed by a
reporter Dr. De Ford boldly Bald: "I have. no fear as to the results of the investigation
attending- upon the distribution and trial of my remedies here in San Francisco. The
people must be the judpres here of the curative powers nnd qualities of my Advanced
Homeopathic Remedies, as they have been before in thousands of cases: In every Eastern
city where my remedies have been tested it lias born found that they cure in ninety-six
f>ut of every one hundred cases, properly Indicated, taking all stages and conditions of
diseases together, and that In these cities the death rate v.-as lowered ten to twenty-five
per cent In one month."
Modern Medicine, v
Dr. De Ford has searched and labored in science to the good of the people of America
and all humanity. He spent five years In study and research In the great universities of
Europe, who conferred upon him the almost exclusive degree of B. M. (Bachelor of Med-
icine). He has Justly earned this great Innor and distinction and well deserves his dj-
sltton aa head of the ADVANCED SCHOOL OF HOMOEOPATHY IN AMERICA. His ad-
vanced syMem of Homoeopathic Medicine, the result of years of experience and research
so mild, yet so quickly effective, has completely taken the place of all Homoeopathic
methods previously advocated or. known, as much as the electric light has superseded
the tallow candle. Dr. !>e Ford says: "My remedies tire the only medicines discovered utÂ«
to this time that are effective, reliable, safe and suitable for the diseases of man. All
other Homoeopathic remedies In existence previous to my discovery are plain white sugar
pills, without the slightest Indication of medicine; no physical, physiological or chemical
evidence of medicinal elements being present.
"You can take the entire contents of a vial of these sugar pills without the slightest
Hi-effects; such so-called medicine Is not any the less fatal, because of its utter lneffect-
iveners against disease and waste of time so precious to the Kick. Don't trifle awav the
health and lite of yourself and dear ones, I beg of you." Dr. De Ford further says- '"Each
one of my remedies has its Individuality as to taste, color, odor Rnd medicinal action
They are effective, yet harmless, because they DO ACT ONLY ON THE DISEASED parts
and. NOT on the healthy structures of the body. As to the old. yet to-day still common
methods of treating disease â with strong drugs, physics, mercury and other poisons refuse
to be treated by a system of medicine that produces a half-dozen diseases in the effort
to get rid of one, and if it cures the disease, practically destroys the patient; medicln*
that Is no more suited for the human system than an ox yoke for a nony " DR nre
FORD'S ADVANCED HOMOEOPATHIC SYSTEM OF MEDICINE Is the interniediate ays-
tern that stands between the candy-sugar-pill fallacy (harmless and FATAL because in-
competent), and the health and life-destroying nostrum and strong drug treatment DR
DE FORD'S ADVANCED HOMOEOPATHIC MEDICINES are the only rational remedies
known to mankind. Do not fail to take advantage of Dr. De Ford's generous offer- get the
medicine that will cure you.. A separate cure for each diseaseâ 45 different remedies for
45 different diseases.

Bpeclal Dispatch to The CWL
PHOENIX. Ariz., Sept. 15.â The fright
ful record of lawlessness in Graham
County, Arizona, has been lengthened by
two more killings, one an awful double
tragedy of murder and robbery, the vic
tims being former Callfornlans.
Â¦John McGeehan kept a saloon In a tent
on the banks of the upper Gila River,
near Guthrle. John McBride, formerly an
employe of the Southern Pacific at Lords
burg, but later running a pump for the
Detroit Copper Company and a friend of
McGeehan's, went to the tent of the lat
ter to stay a few days. Tuesday morn
ing their bodies were found In the tent
saloon, where they slept, riddled with bul
lets. There was evidence of a struggle on
thc part of one of the men, though both
were undressed, and the assault was
doubtless made while they were asleep.
The tent had been looted, everything of
value being taken. A Mexican's sombrero
was found near the door of the tent It
was Identified and Its owner and another
Mexican were arrested and jailed at Clif
ton.
Wednesday morning a young Mexican
named Longfellow Salcido, born and
raised In Clifton, was killed by another
Mexican named Manuel Brlstillos. the af
fair growing out of a discussion of the
double murder. The local Justice of the
Peace, fearing <hat the two men under ar
rest would be lynched, had authorized a
number of armed Mexicans to guard the
Jail. Wednesday morning Bristillos and
Salcido met some of the guards, who ex
pressed a desire to go to breakfast,
whereupon one of them handed' his rifle
to Bristlllo8 to stand guard. He says Sal
cido had a pistol and pulled It, remark-
Ing In a joking manner, crying "Look
out." Brlstillos aimed his weapon, also
In fun, . when It was accidentally dis
charged, the bullet passing through Sal
ddo's body, killing him Instantly. Public
feeling runs high and the accidental kill
ing Is deplored. It is generally believed
the right men are in custody for the mur
der of McGeehan and McBride, and It is
hoped an example will be made of them.
McGeehan formerly _ lived In Shasta
County. Cal. McBride came from the
same State. â¢â¢- '

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 15.â A borrowed baby,
the feigned sickness of a woman and the
presence of two physicians were the dras
tic measures chosen by Mrs. Margaret J.
Story of Morgan Hill to maintain a grip
on her home and the woman's wits came
very near balking the order .made by
Judge Hyland yesterday restoring the
property to A. B. Rockel. Deputy Sheriff
Rives, who went forth armed with the
restitution order this morning to throw
Mrs. Story bag and baggage out Into the
cold world, was nonplussed for "the time;
found woman and baby In bed, surrounded
by doctors, and he appealed to the Sher
iff's office over the phone for help and
advice. : *
He was given lnstrucflons to remove
Mrs. Story and the leased Infant In a car
riage to the hotel, and then proceeded to
carry out the order of the court. Drs.
Higgins and Thayer, who were In attend
ance on the woman, did not attempt to
account for the birth of a baby, and
looked upon their being called as a huge
joke. Mrs. Story, however, declared !t
was hers and that she was ill.
The Storys. and their troubles would fill
a big book. A few years ago Story was
a prosperous fruit-grower at Morgan
Hill, this county, and a widower. An
only daughter was married to A. E.
Rockel, and In his loneliness he sought
the aid of a marriage bureau of Chicago
to find him a helpmeet.
The fee paid, Story was soon In corre
cpondence with a widow wlrt> likewise was
looking for a comforter, especially one
with a lot of cash. A few months later
Story made a trip to Chicago and he sur
prised hla friends by returning with a
buxom wife some fifteen years his Junior,
and a stepdaughter of 13 years. From the
time they landed in Morgan Hill troubles
came thick and fast. Mrs. Story had her
husband deed half of the place to her,
and then she filed a homestead on the
whole of the fifteen acres of orchard. The
woman then set her wits to work to rifl
herself of Story. She had him arrested on
all sorts of charges from battery to at
tempted murder, and finally ran the old
rancher off the place, and for a couple of
years he has not dared to go near her
Story had given atrust deed to the place
to a San Francisco bank before deeding
half of the* place to his wife, who had
made life so unpleasant to him.
fie then joined forces with his son-in
law Rockel and his daughter, and Rockel
took up the indebtedness to the San Fran
cisco bank, and ho and his father-in-law
proceeded to oust Mrs. Story by foreclosure
proceedings. Rockel secured a judgment
and possession of the place, but Mrs. Story
refused to budge. The court was appealed
to, and to-day Mra. Story was ejected.- It
was to stave this oft by feigning sickness
that Mrs. Story borrowed thÂ«-baby and
sought the attendance of two physicians
Story is now battling for a separation
from his wife.

not ill, but he was tired from his long

hension that the President Is on the verge

ROOSEVELT SPEAKS
IN NORTH DAKOTA
BOISE, Idaho. Sept. 15.â Senator Shoup
has organized a reception committee of
fifteen to m&et Governor Roosevelt at
Eutte on the morning of the 19th and es
cort him through the State. The commit
tee will leave here Monday and take a
special car at Pocatello, which will bÂ©
atr&ched to Roosevelt's special. The spe
cial will be run up tbe St. Anthony branch
and make stops at Idaho Falls and Black
foot, arriving at Pocatello at 5 p. m.,
where the principal meeting of the trip
will bs held in the evening.
JAMESTOWN .~N. D.. Sept- 15.â At Val
ley City to-day Governor Roosevelt spoke
at the opera-house, which was filled to
overflowing. Senator Hansbrough pre
eided and introduced" the Governor, who
said In part:
We have the right to appeal to all men who
are Indeed men, who are Indeed Americans, to
upheld the policy that tells for national great
ness. We stand at the threshold of a new
century. We berln that century as one of
the greatest nations of the world, standing in
the forefront. If we are true to ourselves, we
rhall establish for this nation during the cen
tury to come a record unequaled In the his
tory of mankind, but It can only be done by
faring each task as it comes and not flinching
from It. You men of the West who have made
thu commonwealth what it Is to-day, have
not done it by seeking an easy time, not by
tryins to fin<i out how to avert every diffi
culty and recoiling from It, and being afraid
of it; but by overcoming !t, by wresting your
livelihood from a hostile nature and by build
ing ud, farm by farm, town by toven In this
great State. What you have done as Individuals
the nation must do as a nation. Only In that
way can each of us maintain the right we
now have to hold up our heads with pride,
tccaure of the deeds that have been done by
Americans in the past. Each generation has
its allotted task, and according to the way
each generation does or does not perform the
tark will the next generation have cause for
pride or ehame.
In order to keen his engagement In Mon
tana Governor Roosevelt's train will con
tinue its journey Sunday, but there will
positively be no speechmaking. This
country from Mandan to Miles City is the
country Governor Roosevelt used to roam
with his cattle and where many of his old
cowboy friends still live and where ho was
once a peace officer. It is a matter of
de'.-p regret on the part of the Governor
that he is compelled to pass through this
familiar territory in this summary way,
but circumstances have made it neces
sary. Not only will there be no speaking
but the train will not be allowed to pass
through any village during the hour In
which religious services are. in progress
BISMARCK. N. D.. Sept. 15 - The
Roosevelt special train arrived at Bis
marck at 6 o'clock to-day and remained
here during the night. This Is a place
familiar to Governor Roosevelt and he
met many of his old cowboy friends at
the station and the train. Among them
were some who had been with him on his
ranch. A street demonstration had been
prepared In his honor, consisting of a pa
rade and fireworks in the evening, to
gether with a reception by the citizens.
Governor Roosevelt spoke In the evening
nt the Athenium to an overflowing crowd.
After relating some reminiscences of his
cowboy days here in his time he spoke
of the financial question, dwelling upon
the general prosperity of the country un
der the McKinley administration and then
discussed the Philippine question much
as hÂ«* has in other speeches during the
present trip. Speaking of the trust Issue
he said:
Of course when prosperity comes It comes to
the unjust as well aÂ» to the Just and Ju?t ex
actly as hard times strike a decent man, H
also strikes th* man that is not decent. Therfc
has bp*n much complaint ujrninst President
McKinley and hi? administration because
trusts have flourished. Tbcy did not flourish
four years ago. Nothing flourished four years
a so.
We have had four years of rolng- forward.
Now abuses are sure to come. We want to de
vote our best enerÂ«ies to p?t rid of those
abuse*. We have had a little experience of that
kind In my own State. Now, two years ago I
ran for Governor in New York. Against me
they had put up Judire Van Wyck. who was a
pp<"clal protegre of Mr. Bryan and a bosom
friend of Mr. Croker. (Laughter.)
Tou seem to have heard of the gentleman.
Mr. Croker and Mr. Van Wyck were very se
vere upon corporation*. They said they were
down on corporations; that they were ac-ilnxt
them. I nay I was no more against corpora
tion* than I was against a redheaded man. I
will do Justice to the redheaded man. If he
Is a bad man I will cinch him. If he Is a good
man I will stand by him. If a corporation does
Its duty and acts tquarely. .It is all right, and
I will stand up for It. If it don't do bo. I will
make it do Its duty If I have the power. Now,
ycu eee I have the advantage of talking the
way 1 did because I oould keep my promise. I
made the kind of promises that could be kept.
We cot a law enacted. There are defects In
it. of course, but the result so far has been
that we have put upon the aasessment roll for
taxation something: like two hundred millions
of. corporate property that had previously es
caped taxation. That was something- tangible.
Tou can never accomplish everything at one*.
NO WONDER HE CAN'T SEE THE EVI
DENCES OF PROSPERITY.
ST. LOUIS. Sept. 15.â A less experienced
man than William J. Bryan might very
well have had his head turned by the re
ception accorded him In St. Louis to-night.
He spoke here In the Coliseum Hall, under
the auspices of the National Democracy
of Commercial Travelers. The hall is said
to seat 14,000 people. Not only was every
seat occupied, but every available foot of
standing room was also covered.
Mr. Bryan was late in arriving at the
hall, having been detained by his attend
ance upon a meeting of the Knights and
Ladies of Honor at Concordla Park,
where he also made a brief address. Mr.
Bryan had arrived in the city about 5
o'clock, coming here from East St. Louis.
He was escorted across the Mississippi by
a committee of the commercial travelers,
who met him In the Illinois city.
The time previous to Mr. Bryan s ar
rival at the Coliseum was filled by other
speakers, among them Webster Davis.
Mr. Davis took occasion to reply to the
recent charge that he had received money
from President Kruger for taking a posi
tion in favor of the Democratic ticket In
the present campaign. He said thftt he
had gone to South Africa to visit a per
sonal friend of his who waa Consnl there.
He then referred to his career aa Assist
ant Secretary of the Interior under the
present administration, saying that he had
worked day and night for the Government
for three years. In addition he had fought
the battles of the Republican party for
four years, having given several weeks of
his time to secure the election of Mr.
Hanna to the Senatorship from Ohio.
Mr. Bryan arrived at 8:45 o'clock and
the audience rose almost as one man to
greet him as he strode across the stage.
A majority of the vast multitude were
equipped with small American flags, and
they waved them with a will. The dem
onstration continued for five or six min
utes and it was In some respects a repeti
tion of the nag episode in the Kansas City
: convention.
Mr. Bryan read his speech from manu
script. The points of the address were
cheered when made and the entire docu
ment was well received.
J The Democrats were, he said, favorable
to the expansion of our trade, but there
was a vast difference between expansion
and imperialism. The one looked to a
simple enlargement, the other to a change
of the governmental system. If we were
to help to govern the Filipinos they must
be expected to help govern usâ the ar
rangement must be reciprocal. No other
system would be In accord with our In
stitutions; no other system could be rec
onciled to our declaration that "all men
are created equal."
Did we want the Filipinos as Senators
or members of Congress? No. Then we
must take them, if at all, as subjects.
This could not be thought of, and the
only course open was to get out of the
Philippines Just as we we preparing to
get out of CiA>a.

t ar.'. them to be surprised If they find that
Uiefr overcor.fideno* results in the defeat of

Â»p.nt to sound a note of warning. There is
evidence on all sides in our country that the

that Wf'.'.ism McKinlÂ»y will be re-elected, and
therefore they <5o not feel called upon to exert

Ecmarks About Nourishing Food.
'A physician's wife. Mrs. Dr. Landon.
gave me a packet of Grape-Nuts about

Bare I would find thc food very beneli-
cul. both for my ovin use and for my
patients. I was particularly attracted to
the food, as at that time the weather was
very hot and I appreciated the fact that
the Grape-Nuts required no cooking.
"Thc food was deliciously crisp, and
most inviting to the appetite. After
making use of it twice a day for three
or four weeks I discovered that it was a
most wonderful invigorator. I used to
fiifler pteatly from exhaustion, head-
aches and depression of spirits. My work
had been very trying at time* and indi-
gestion had set in.
"Now I am alv.-ays well and ready for
any amount of work, have an abundance
of active energy and cheerfulness and
mental poise. I have proved to my en-
tire satisfaction that this chance has
been brought about by Grape-Nuts
food.
"The fsct that it is predicted is a
very desirable feature. I have had many
remarkable results in fcedinj? Grape-
Kuts to my patients, and I cannot speak
too highly of the food. My friends con-
stantly comment on the change in my
appearance. I have gained nine pounds
tjnee brpinning the use of this food."

Southern Pacific Company, 29 Boulevard
des Italiens, Paris, 14th Aug., 1900.
The Hon. N. P. Chipman, President State
Board of Trade, San Francisco, Cal.
Dear Sir: Professor H. TV. Wiley is the
Chief Chemist of the Agricultural De
partment of the United States. He was a
member of the Jury of Award of Class 60,
which comprises vitlcultural products,
and has acted most efficiently In the In
terests oi" the United States.
The Jury of Award passed a resolution
declaring that "all wines and brandies of
fered for examination bearing an*y label
indicating a false description be excluded
frcm examination or recompense, and the
Director General be requested to have all
such wines at once removed from the Ex
position grounds." Professor H. W. Wi
ley protested against this action upon the
ground set forth in his letter, but In a
modified form the action was sustained,
and the wines, bearing French labels were
refused the right of competition. Subse
quently Professor Wiley secured a modi
fication of this resolution which admitted
the wines to examination and marking,
which is another name for ratins, but
that the markings or rating for such
wines be deposited with the president of
the Jury for such further use as may be
hereafter decided upon. This private
marking: and rating was subsequently ac
complished, and Professor "Wiley inform
ed me that the Cresta Blanca wines rated
up to IS on a scale of 20. and that if these
wines had been admitted to competition
the Cresta Blanca product would have ob
tained the grand prize. Professor "Wiley
further declared that wines of Califor
nia were shown by these ratings to be
excellent wine, there being but two brands
of wines in France superior to the best
brands of California. I call your atten
tion and the attention of the board to the
existence of these ratlngs.and to the fact
that they are in the possession of the
president of the Jury of Award. I will
make an effort to have an official copy of
them obtained and forwar'ded to the
board. The commercial value of these
ratings will be readily understood. While,
in my opinion,' the wines will not receive
medals or recompense, the certified copy
of the ratings by the jury would be of the
highest commercial value.
I beg to call the attention of the board
to the fact that Professor Wiley, Chief
ChemisL to the Department of Agricul
ture, and Professor Rising of the Univer
sity of California have placed the wine In
terest in the State under special obliga
tion. For usefulness in these matters
Professor Wiley has been insistent in de
fending our wines. In my opinion it
would be well -to call the attention of the
Chamber of Commerce to the fact, which
may be briefly outlined as follows:
The Jury of Award. Exposition Unlver
selle. Paris. 1900, declined to admit some
of the California wines to competition
with the wines of the world because they
bore P'rench labels. Subsequently the
same jury authorized irregular rating of
these wines, which rating was filed with
the president of the jury for such use as
he might see Jit to make, ajid for the use
of the Superior Jury when final action
was taken! Publication of these ratings
when they arc obtained, will be of the
highest value to the wine product of Cali
fornia.
I think a resolution of thanks to Pro
fessor Wiley and Professor Rising would
not be inappropriate.
It remains to be noted that the wines
presented to the committee for examina
tion were not from the stock of the Cali
fornia Paris Commission; they were wines
collected by the Department of Agricul
ture. The California Paris Commis
sion does not appear to have. taken any
part whatever in the transaction. Very
truly, yours, -_. ; WM. H. mtt.t^,

headquarters of the generalissimo. Bru
pere. are established at Chartres, where
the foreign attaches arc also quartered.
Lieutenant T. Bc-ntley Mott, the American
military attache at Paris, represents the
I nited States. The maneuvers will close
September 20 with a review of HO.OOO
troops by President Loubet at Chartres.
A striking feature of the operations Is
the introduction on an extensive scale of
automobiles In order to secure a practical
test of their military utility. Several of
the generals and most of th'e members of
their staffs have been furnished with fast,
light motor cars, which have provÂ«Â»d of
the utmost value. The eeneral's aides de
camp covered unprecedented distances In
a few hours yesterday. General Brugere's
orderly officer ran 170 kilometres in the
morning, making a complete circuit of the
two contending armies and furnishing
General Brugere with full details of the
Eituation by noon.
Where the autocars can be utilized the
use of horses by generals and messengers
would appear doomed.

His Grace, Mo6t Rev. Archbishop

judges will not be announced until the
evening of the contest.
The cliff dwellers are exceedingly wroth
over the situation on the hill and several
conflicts have occurred between them and
Gray Bros.' quarrymen, and the end is not
yet.
The court then adjourned
When they returned Judge Hunt stated
that Mr. Hutchins would visit the place
again next Tuesday, when 'the expert will
nyte carefully the placing of the charges
and the amount of powder in each and
present a report based on his observations
to the court, who will render his decision
in accordance with the engineer's opinion.
"If I find." said his Honor, "that con
tinued blasting threatens the safety of the
property owners on the hill I shall issue
an injunction either to cause the charges
to be reduced sufficiently to render them
too weak to cause inconvenience or, if I
find that this is impossible, I may order
the work to be stopped altogether. While
I feel sure that this morning's demonstra
tion v.as fairly conducted on both sides,
yet I do not care to give an opinion before
hearing expert testimony." â¢
When the open-air court opened counsel
on both sides were present. Warren Greg
ory and H. Smith representing the plain
tiffs, while Fisher Ames appeared for
Gray Bros. J. P. IJutchings, a mining
engineer, was present to act as expert,
end George Gray directed the placing of
the blast. Counsel on both sides decided
to waive verbal argument and left the
talking to two charges placed thirty feet
apart and containing 2C5 pounds of black
;>owder. Judge Hunt gave the signal and
the court adjourned to the porch of Mrs.
Folsom'a house. With a mighty roar the
charges exploded and several hundred
tons of real estate slid downward. Then
Judge, counsel, plaintiffs and defendants
climbed over the edge of the cliff to see
what it looked like. His Honor and Ex
pert Hutching clambered down the steep
descent with the agility of practiced
mountain climbers until to the watchers
on the top they "showed scarce as gross
as beetles."
Mrs. Mary Folsom, whose home liter
ally overhanca the cliff, and Sidney J.
Nau are tht? chief among the complain
ants, and last Friday they tried, through
Attorney Gregory, to get out an injunc
tion to restrain Gray Bros, from using
more than lifty pounds of powder for a
blast.
Judpc- Hunt, before whom the hearipg
was beld, was shown plans of the neigh
borhood and of the quarry, but this did
not satisfy his Honor as to the exact sit
uation, so he determined to cross the
runieon of Telograph Hill. Yesterday
morning the court visited the scene, and
standing as near to the edge of the cliff
as was consistent, with judicial dignity
and human safety waited to see for him
self just what hapi>ened after a charge
was touched off.
So sang Bret Harte in "Fate," and so
sing the people who have builded their
houses on the rock known as Telc&raph
Kill, at least those who own property on
that portion of the hill which overhangs
the quarry oprrattd by Gray Bros, at
Lombard and Montgomery streets. Kvery
time a blast dislodgrs yreat masses of
rock and .sends them hurtling 200 or 300 feet
down the cliff the dwellers on the summit
have ail kinds of misgivings, and not only
their abodes but their faith in the Scrip
tural advice regarding the erection of
houses on rocks is severely shaken.
Winds have blown, they say, and floods
have come and it never fc-ased them, but
when Qrav Bros, touched off fuses con
nected with heavily charged mines almost
under their very feet, causing the homes
of the cliff dwellers to bhed shingles and
glass and opening fissures in their back
yards, it .seemed that a house on the sand
would Ik: a yreat deal pleaaanter to live
in. "
But the house that was bullded upon the rock
Was swallowed by tho earthquake shock.

Colonel W. J. Cotton Tells
How Samoa Was Brought
Back to Nome.
Captain Deceived the Foreigners and
Had the Ship in United States
Waters Before Discovery
Was Made.
Â«
Among the San Francisco people who
have i^cently returned from the AJaskan j
gold fieids are Colonel W. J. Cotton, a
former newspaper man, J. F. Donoghue.
J. J. Frigars and M. S. Griffith. They
have come home for the, winter, intending
to return to Nome early In the spring
and work their claims, of which they
have several.
Colonel Cotton tells some interesting j
facts concerning the experiences of the
English and American experts who char
tered the steamer Samoa in San Fran
cisco ar.d sailed for Siberia last June for
the purpose of exploiting the concession
granted the Eastern Siberian Syndicate
(limited) of London, on the eastern coast j
of Siberia, Colonel Cotton thinks there is
little doubt that the affair will result
in serious international complications be- :
tween Russia versus England and \
America. :
'â¢When gold was discovered in such pay
ing- quantities in Nome," said Cotton, "at
tention of capital was attracted to Siberia !
and a corporation organized under the
name of the Eastern Siberian Syndicate,
Limited, of I>ondon, with a capital of one
million shares, par value Â£1 each The
Eyndicate is; composed of very prominent
English. Russian and American capital
ists. It is rumored that Lord Salisbury
and thÂ© Duke of Fife are iarge share
holder*.
"The Samoa waa chartered by repre
sentatives of the company and sailed from
: San Francisco June. 10. Among the pas
sengers was an interpreter named Me- I
Phfrson. who, although born in Russia,
travels under an English passport. It is
the fe<Â»linn: among the English and Ameri
cans that more or less of their troubles
were brought about by the interpretation
of this latter individual, as hev.undoubtodly
sympathized with the Russians and bated
thÂ«? others. It was understood by the !
parties representing the English syndicate
that George D. Roberts, the well known
American mining engineer, would be their
lÂ«-ador, as he waa one of the principal or
irnnizers of the syndicate.. Bogdonovich
represented the Russian capitalists and as
thf expedition was going into Russian
waters Bogdonovich was agreed upon as
tho chief while over there. :
â¢'After arriving on the Siberian coast
and completing a portion of the work
Hr Roberts desired to return to Nome,
to which the Russian strenuously ob
jected, but eventually gave in.
"The Samoa returned to Xome about
July 25 after taking on board the engi
neer? left behind. She steamed out on
the 27th headed for a section of the Sibe
rian coaPt. where the party expected to
meet the Russian gunboat Yakout. Upon
arriving at the appointed rendezvous they,
found the Yakout waiting, but their
reception was not as warm as
iney had anticipated. Bogdonovicn
and his companions went at once on
board, purposely neglecting to invite any
of the Kngush or Americans.
"About August 12 Mr. Roberts again
requested that the steamer be taken to
Nome on September 1, Boguonovicn
absolutely refused, stating that he was
the head of the expedition; ...at he was
also there for scientific purposes in be-
Jiait oi the Russian Government and could
not and would not leave this important
duty for the purpose of transporting Mr.
Koberts to Nome whenever fancy seized
him.
"Xow, Mr. Roberts lias for some years
been in the habit of having his own way
â¢.â¢specially when In command of a party'
a-nd this statement by the Kussian made
nim not only indignant, but angry, and
he declared that the Samoa should land
him any old place he desired, as she was
chartered in America and Hew the Amer
ican flag and under these clcrumstancea
no Russian could dictate to him.
"To _<ay this was sta.rtling news Is to
put it very mildly. Captain Johnson on
ihe night of the 14th of August, a very
heavy tog prevailing, turned the ship s
nose toworu Nome.
"On the rollowing morning when the
interpreter came on deck he saw by the
compass which way the ship was heading
and hastening to Captain Johnson, who
was on the bridge, astted where they were
going. The captain replied with tne ut
most sangfroid, 'To Nome.' The inter
preter collapsed and tumbling down tne
stairs announced the news to Bogdono
vich, his chiof. '
".Meanwhile the captain lost no time in
getting the English and Americans to
gether, informing them of what he had
done and advising each man to arm him
self and stand by und see the thing
through. They at once sprang to posi
tions of vantage and, although poorly
armed and few in number, they were
prepared to render a good account of
themselves.
"iiOKdonovich came on deck in a per
fect rage and demanded an explanation.
The ship was by this time in American
waters. Captain Johnson stated that as
he felt responsible for the safety of his
passengers he had determined to take his
ship to some American port for a settle
ment of the question. Here occurred a
dramatic scene, over which it is possiblo
international complications may arise.
"With great dignity, although trembling
with rage, Bogdonovlch, stepping back
drew from his breast a document, "which
to the astonishment of all showed that
he was not only the declared agent of the
Russian capitalists, but officially sent and
was a representative of the imperial Rus
sian Government. As such representative,
he declared, he and his countrymen were
grossly insulted and outraged by being
kidnaped from Russian waters.
"Mr. Roberts and his friends were taken
greatly aback and instantly realized that
serious complications stared them in the
face. However, it was too late to back
out now. The Cossacks, although pre
vented from obtaining arms, wanted to
fight, so steam was crowded on and in a
short time the ..amoa dropped her anchor
off Nome, near the United States infan
try barracks. The captain went ashore,
and, explaining the case to Major Evans,
a file of soldiers under command of Lieu
tenant Knudson was sent on board and
the English and American contingent
came ashore, but the Russians were not
permitted to land. Later the ship was an
chored under the guns of the revenue
cutter Manning ana the. soldiers were
sent ashore.
"A court of inquiry was at once held and
after due deliberation it was ordered
that tho Samoa, under the escort of tho
Manning, should take the Russians back
to Siberia and turn them over to tlie
Yakout there. The Samoa Is to return to
Nome, pick up Mr. Roberts and his party
and take them to San Francisco.
"Aiiprehe-nsions are felt as to how the
Russian officials will act, once they get
the American ship in their waters.
"AH sorts of overtures have been made
to Bogdonnvich in the endeavor to smooth
over matters, but he refuses to be pla
cated. He is determined to at once report
the matter to the Russian military attache
at Washington, who. he says, will see
that the honor of Russia Is upheld Â«Cnd all
rights for mining in Siberia by the East
ern Siberian Syndicate withdrawn."
Chief Engineer Holmes Objects to
Filling In of Foot of Spear
Street.
Commissioner Manson of the Board of
Public "Works received a letter yesterday
from Chief Engineer Holmes of the Har
bor Commission, in which he states that
if the city should fill in its portion of
the foot of Spear street he would advise
the commission to receive from the city
government an agreement : to keep tho
wharf in repair during such construction,
and to indemnify the State against any
damages that might occur during such
time. The solid bottom in tho vicinity
of the street is shelving- and any nllins
that might be made would tend to dis
place large quantities of mud, not only
tilling the adjacent slip, but would dis
place the standard piles in the adjacent
structure. Holmes says the Harbor Com
missioners, under section 2342 of the Po
litical Code, would have the right to st<:p
any such construction unless the condi
tions referred to were agreed upon.
The Board of "Works will adhere to it*
original intention, announced two months
ago, to construct a plank roadway on tho

action to relieve crowded condition of
schools.
As a result of the first inspection made
of schools reported by Superintendent
Webster to be in a congested condition the
Board of Education yesterday decided to
establish an additional class in each of
five schools in the Mission district, namely
Peabody, Bernal Heights, Hawthorne.
Haight and Buena Vista schools. This
will necessitate the appointment of five
additional teachers, and two have already
been selected. Miss A. A. Duffy, who was
consolidated out of the Peabody School,
will bo reassigned to a class of fifty pu
pils which are to be transferred from the
Marshall Primary, found by the board to
be overcrowded. Miss M. A. Rollins, who
was consolidated out of the Henry Du
rant School, will be assigned to the class
to be formed out of the overflow in the
Bernal School. This class will be estab
lished outside of the scnool Other schools
Which will in all likelihood be equipped
with additional classes include the Buena
Vi=ta Hawthorne and HaiKht schools and
nos^lbly the Fairmount. As two vacant
classrooms are to be opened in the Haight
School two extra teachers may be ap
pointed. Other schools in the district may
require additional teachers and if so will
l,e provided by the board. The full list of
appointees will be announced at next
Wednesday's meeting.
Chairman Mark says that the congestion
was practically as Superintendent Web

cases to be exaggerated. Superintendent

In the Columbia School some pupils have

Mark's Annual Report.
Chairman Mark filed his annual report
for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1900.
with the Mayor yesterday. In his report
Mark refers to the chanpres inaugurated
by the charter in the -administration of
the - department. He considers the
centralization of authority in the princi
pals and the > increased supervision of
schools to be In the nature of Improve
ments. The rf port says:
The board has abolished special privileges
for the reason that the department should be
considered a unit.' What Is of real worth for
one school should also be of value to another.
This has led to the introduction of special lines

of instruction, to make them uniform in all
schools, thereby giving equal rights and privi
leges to all.
The board Intends to formulate a plan and
adopt it. which' will settle, once and for all.
the method of electing teachers into the de
partment when needed. The charter provides for
civil service, but this plan cannot apply to the
School l>erartment. as teachers are properly
certified and have already passed one test, in
either graduating from the university, the
normal school or having secured their certi
ficate ur-on examination.
The question of promtlon of pupils from grade
to grade should, in a properly supervised de
partment, be left entirely with the principal
and class teacher. However, opinion on this
question is somewhat divided, and the board
has adopted a conciliatory measure, thereby
excusing certain puptls who are honorary and
recommended from examinations, and examin
ing others, allowing thÂ« year's standing to
count for one half and the examinations of the
board to count for the other half, thereby ad-
Justing the matter fairly for all.
The most important work that the board haÂ»
accomplished Is the adoption of a new course
of study for four years. After most careful
consideration It was finally agreed to change
the present nine years' course of study of the
primary and grammar schools to an eight
years' course, thus following the plan adopted
by nearly all of the large cities of our union.
Manual Training.
The following figures show the extent of the
introduction of manual training: Number of
centers cr laboratories. 7; total approximate
cost of equipment, 16000; number of special
teachers tall highly qualified to perform the

The board intends to purchase out of the
revenue of this fiscal year $2000 worth of indl
tent books and $1000 worth of supplementary
hooks. It is hoped that during? the cominp
year more money will be expended for this
most worthy purpose.

Promotion by Priority.
Perhaps the incident which is of most
vital importance to teachers already in
the -department is involved In the asser
tion made by President Mark yesterday
that all teachers appointed now will be
employed in the priority of service sys
tem. To teachers this means the only just
method of promotion. It was absolutely
and unfailingly. followed by the predeces
sor of this board, and when it was over
thrown The Call showed the evil which
resulted. Favoritism and scandal took the
place of merit, and women who had been
in the department less than two months
were advanced by favor to stable posi
tions, while women without a pull or in
fluence were relegated to the unasslgned
list without pay.
The Call exposed this traffic, and now
President Mark says that priority of ser
vice will govern advancement. He says
there will be no more consolidation of
teachers out of the department and the
congestion of schools will be relieved.
THOMAS CRONIX, formerly a coach
â¢nan for Sanders & Johnson, Phelan
II building, has been for some nights
terrorizing residents in the vicinity
of the Masonic Cemetery by his peculiar
actions. The man's mind is unbalanced,
and yesterday' morning he made a des
perate attempt to kill himself at the cor
ner of Masonic and Central avenues. Leon
Straus?, who lives in the neighborhood,
saw him attempt to butt out his brains
against a tombstone, and tried to capture
him.
Cronin ran to the corner, where men
were working on tombstones, and, seizing
a hammer, tried to batter his brains out.
He 'threw away the hammer, seized a
chisel and cut himself seven times on the
scalp with it before he was disarmed. He
was so violent that it took the combined
strength of fourteen men to hold him
down until the patrol wagon arrived from
the O'Farrel-street station.
Cronin was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where his wounds were stitched and
dressed. He was then locked up in a
padded cell and a straltjacket put on him.
He had been coachman for Sanders &
Johnson for four years, but was dis
charged about three weeks ago owing to
his peculiar actions. He had been room
ing at the Soto House, but spent moat of
his nights wandering around the cemetery
and tearing the wits out of people in the
neighborhood.
Stockholders and Directors
Quarrel Over Dilhan's
Dismissal.
Board Issues Stock to Circumvent
the Captain's Friends, Who Axe
Now Preparing to Go
to Law.
There Is a merry war on In the San
Francisco Riding Club. The stockhold
ers of the club and the few left over di
rectors are exchanging compliments and
there is likely to be an appeal to. the
courts before the disturbing matters are
finally adjusted.
The light revolves round the war
scarerd Captain Dilhan, founder of the
club, stockholder to the tune of 330 shares
and former riding master of the elite.
The trouble started some few weeks ago.
The captain was given a three weeks'
leave of absence, but at the expiration of
his vacation, instead of receiving, a wel
coming glad hand,' he got a frigid note,
setting forth, that his services were no
longer required. Dilhan, however, is not
the man to accept defeat meekly. He ap
pealed to his friends, the stockholders,
and they put In a petition praying that
the former riding master be reinstated.
The board paid no attention to the ap
pealâalthough the petitioners represented
445 shares, more than one-half of the 775
shares, which constituted the original is
sue of the club.
Indignant at the treatment they had re
ceived at the hands of the directors, the
stockholders consulted Attorney John J.
Barrett. Barrett's lirst bit of advice was
to have the books of the club examined
and that advice was faithfully carried
out yesterday.
The examination of the books was an
eye-opener to Dilhan'-s friends, who found
that, on Friday, without the formality of
calling a meeting and putting the matter
to a vote, 4o0 extra shares of San Fran
cisco Riding School stock was issued, the
same being: bought up by George Quarre.
an employe of J. Dalzelle Brown, one of
the club's directors.
"It's this way." paid an Indignant stock
holder last evening, "the four directors
intend to run the club to suit themselves
and by owning 400 extra shares they couid
do so, fur they would represent the ma
jority in all club matters. But that
stock was not issued legally. There was
no meeting called and the matter was
not put to vote.
"The riding club has not been very pros
perous of late," went on the stockholder.
"Members have been dropping off and
those who still remain have been giving
but little attention to club matters. In
fact, this inattention has been so marked
that there was not enough interest in
club matters to get "up an election and in
default of one the old directors held over.
And now onlv four of the required eight
are fulfilling the duties of their officeâ J.

man, president, and Directors Flourno>
and Buckingham. Director Sam Knight
Is In Nome, Mips Farquharson is abroad,
Mrs. Fannie Lent, annoyed by the con
tinual petty quarrels, has resigned, and
Mrs. Hooper, who is suing the club for
the death of a valuable horse, has also
resigned. However, in spite of all the
misfortunes the club has suffered, the
stockholders are determined to once
again put the ciub on its feet and win out.
With this end in view we intend to force
a meeting of the directors and have that
400 extra share issue recalled. If we are
not successful with the directors we shall
bring the matter into court."

Mrs. P. Walewski, a Polish woman re

the heart. Her husband and son had left
her two months ago and when her purso
Â¦was empty and the cupboard bare sho

About three months ago Walewski, hi.-*

Chicago. Two weeks later the son disap
peared. Where he went no one seems to
know, but it is presumed that he found
employment somewhere Only another
week had passed when the father passed
out of the dingy apartments and was not
seen afterward. The neighbors think he
went to work in Oakland.
Since the. departure of her husband. Mrs.
Walewakl has given little information to
any one. She was very poor and lived
alone. Charitably Inclined people kept
the wolf from her door. Last night about

complained that the boys were making

her that such a thing could not be avoided
and their conversation ceased. He heard
her turn the key in the lock and soon
afterward was startled by two reports
from a pistol. He heard a slight move

The old man was sore. For five innings
the Brummels played good baseball. Then
they played very bad baseball and what
might have been a victory ended in an
other defeat, Mosklman, who has. been
put upon the slab quite frequently of late,
twirled for the Dudes. Seven hits were
all that the pretzel stickmen amassed and
they were not bunched, yet five men were
sent over the plate to gladden Hank's

three runs by Frisco made Oakland a fit

an easy Infield fly which was fielded
badly, allowing Pabst to score. A two

The fanatic from Oakland sat in the
grand stand yesterday afternoon at Rec
reation grounds and he murmured and
he mumbled all through the ei^ht and
one-half Innings of play. For five rounds
he .smiled with a reservation of joy that
feared to mock itself. Then the tears
streamed down his face and his pain wag
great as he caught sight of Cal Ewlng

Ingleside Club Files Suit Against Its
Â¦ Eival, but Does Not Ask
That Union Be Closed
To-Day.
The Union Park Coursing Association
will run oft, its advertised stake to-Â«ay
without fear of legal interference on the
part of its rival, the Ingleside Club. As
predicted, suit was filed yesterday in the
Superior Court by the Ingleside Associa
tion against the Union Park management,
praying for judgment restraining the de
fendant from holding- coursing meetings
between certain dates and thus compell
ing them to live up to an alleged agree
ment entered Into by both parties In June
last.
The case has been assigned to Judge
Hunt for trial and, will be heard to-mor
row.
The Union Park Club claims that the
only agreement with Ingleside was that
the alternate date plan would be given a
trial; that soon after it was Inaugurated
dogmen complained that with only one
park running the stakes were so few that
it made business unprofitable to them and
to better serve the interests of leashmen
the asociation felt that the alternate date
plan should be discontinued. The Union
people declare that they have lived up
to the arrangement, that Is, they have
tried the plan and found that It was detri
mental to coursing interests. The talk of
restraining them had little effect, though
the people of tho big park were evidently
prepared to offset' any attempt to close
them down.
William Thompson of Ingleside said
yesterday that his association would en
deavor to force the other side to continue
the alternate date idea on what It termed
a plain agreement betwen the two man
agements. He declared that action was
deferred until Monday In order not to "tie
up" the owners whose dogs are entered in
the Union Park stake, as it would be
against coursing Interests and be an in
justice to those who are not directly con
nected with the main Issue.
The rundown of the open stake at
Union Park yesterday was productive of
good coursing. The Merced hares made
hard work for the hounds and the relief
dogs were called on In eight of the goes.

NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â Imp. the black
whirlwind, won the Second Special at
Gravesend to-day amidst the wildest en
thusiasm, with the Brooklyn and Subur
ban handicap winner. Kinley Mack, the
mighty Ethelbert and good three-year-old
McMeekin behind her. Ethelbert was a
hot favorite at 7 to 10, Willie Imp was the
outsider, closing at 7 to 1.
At the start Imp broke last, but Burns
quickly brought her to the front and
the showed the way down past the grand
stand with Kinley Mack. McMeekin and
Ethe'bert lengths apart behind her. Burns
let her race along at her own pace and
there was no change In the order around
the near turn and up the back stretch.
At the end of a mile McMeekin rounded
up a little, and Turner on Ethelbert was
already bogir.niiiR to ride with his hands
to kce;Â» his mount up. On the far turn
Kinley Mack and McMeekin both moved
up to the black mare, but Burns let fin
& wrap and Imp showed the way into the
stretch with everything driving behind
her. McMeekin challenged resolutely
â¢when straightened out. but soon dropped
back beaten and It was left for Kinley
Mack and Ethelbert to fight It out with
her. Both boys rode desperately, but in
vain, and the wire was passed with Imr>
a lenpth in front of Kinley Mack, who
was a neck before Ethelbert, McMeekin
whipping the field In. The very small
bettors in the inrlosure must have backed
the mare, as such an ovation has rarely
been accorded to a thoroughbred as greet
ed her as she rantered back to the stand

i tin facing was exciting throughout.
The weather was warm, and William
Fieldwick had the track in superb condi
tion. Ktivorites look three of the six har
ness events decided. Charlie Me captured
the 2:i:0 trot and Delplii the 2:13 class pace.
In the running events February, Bavassa,
Kl Mido and Bathos were successful
ones, i ''Â¦'.?
If the harness events evoked interest,
the runners plainly hail the call, some
fierce betting being lr.dulgc-d fn. The .Fa
vorite stake, valued at ji'Jo5, a. handicap!
at cne mile and a quarter, was the feature
of the' day, simmering down to a head
linish between J'Jl Mldo, the favorite, and
Morinel. Eight 10 ' I've was chalked
against El ilido. At the Ilc3t breakaway
B tarter; Pat iteagan sent the bunch away
perfectly aiigned. After I^ou Rey had
rr.adu the running for a mile he fell back
beaten. Mqrihei now showed first, with
Mounce on the favorite moving up from
the rear. Gradually El Aliao wore the
galiant little mare down and in a hard
drive led her past the judges a head in
front in 2:07 x i. Grand Sachem ran a fair
third. Â¦ _

lead. Cleur of his company to the,pad
dock, ho was there challenged by Mounce,
astride Bavassa, and in a desperate duel
was nosed out the last couple of jumps.
Articulate ran a good third, while Dunfree
closed up like an umbrella early in. tho
game
It was 1 o'clock when the 2:30 trot was
called. McBrier sold favorite at $20, the
Held brought ?15 and Charley Me $8. The
favorite won the llrst heat cleverly, after
which, despite Billy Donathan's excellent
reinsmanshlp, McBrier was clearly out
footed. Charley Me captured the second
and third heats In exciting drives *rom
the first choice, causing him to be installed
a hot favorite. At this stage, Cecil
dropped in with Bob Ingersoll, winning
the fourth heat In 2:14?i. Charley Ale
gathered in the necessary heat to draw
down rtrst money without much effort.
Delphi, a fast and game gentleman in
black and a son of Director, gave the tal
ent quite a jarrinp by his annexation of
the 2:13 pace, and his backers, If they were
stanch, should have money to burn to
night, With pools selling Held $20, Wild
Nutling $10 and Key Direct $3, Ed I.af

easily from Edna It and William Harold.
This altered the complexion of affairs, I
Direct and Rey -Direct coupled bringing
?20 and the field a lilse amount. At odds
of Id to 1 in the books for the heat, Delphi
came from nowhere when the bunch had
squared for home, winning the second
heat from John A. Even then the field
sold favorite over him, but he repeated
the trick. Driver Whitehead taking things
coolly to the stretch. The fourth and last
was merely a repetition of the two preced
ing heats, Delphi coming from behind
when sent. I Direct went lame, which
accounted for her weak showing-, after
having a heat.
In the running events, Mocorito lost the
six furlong selling event to February, the
post favorite. Merry Boy finished third:
A mile and a sixteenth run closed tfie
day's sport, the final number being de
clared off. Bathos, the favorite, led from
the start, winning in a common gallop.
The polo game at the park In the fore
noon also proved an attractive card. The
Reds, captained by Tom Driscoll, played
all around the Blues, winning by a score
of 6 to 0. Walter Hqbart was unable to
appear, owing to an injured shoulder, his
place on the Blue team being taken bv
Ollie Tobin. The summary:

Six young lady students of the Oakland
H!gh School, members of some of tho
moBt prominent families of this city, have
been suspended for thirty days, because
ia a fit of girlish frolic they were ru!*ty
of the heinous crime of technical defiance
of the constituted authority that reposes
In Principal J. B. McChesney.
This drastic punishment was visited up
on Miss Qraco Davis, Miss Verina Mor
row, Miss Marian Morrow, Miss Alice
Lawes, Hiss Pansy Perkins ar.d Miss
Edna Orr. There Is consternation among
the 709 members of the school. There are
a score r,f teachers who are amazed at the
crder and there is a half-suppressed feel-
Ing among not a few parents that the
young ladies were subjected to a punish
ment that far from fitted the crime. And
here is the story:
The young ladies are members of one of
those girls' secret socieiiepâ a fraternityâ
the Alpha Sigma. It so happened a few
days ago that Miss Mabel Wilcox. a very
popular fraternity K'-rl, had told her
pchoolmates that she was going away and
there were tears and all sorts of sympa
thetic consolation meotirss because of
that announcement. Miss Wilcox's de
parture was set for 9:30 o'clock Thursday
mornir.p from Sixteenth strvet station.
Tho half-dozen Alpha Siginas in ques
tion decided to give her a farewell at the
depot. But tho rub came In the time
which Interfered v.-ith their prompt at
tendance at Fchool. They went to Princi
pal McChesr.ey when school opensd on
the morning Miss Wilcox waa to leave
and asked permission to absent them
selves for the next half hour. To their
diFmay the request was denied. As they
left tho rchool ofllc<\ unluckily, along
rolled a streetcar and Miss Wilcox was a
p.issenger. headed for the depot.
Though McChesney stood on the school
steps flrmly Flying "no." six dalnty
mipses fiod for the car anri. horrors! rod* 1
sway with their companion, heeding:
nrjther the command of the principal nor
th*Â» consequences which would bo?all

hour the youn? ladies had returned to
school, but the ban was upon them, and
in a shower of tonrs they h^ard the awful
sentence of banishment pronounced.

a Quarrel over work. Miller fled, despite
tie presence of eoores of ftllow laborers,
and headed for Uie Mount Diablo Range.

the local constabulary, trailing the mur
derer, who Is a\ir>z*ra<zd to lÂ»* hiding In one

lieved to have sought refuge. They are

are to capture the murdarer dead or alive.
His pursuers kcov." that hÂ« is armed, and
no chances will be taken.
The murder was a particularly brutal
klllir^. It r.ppears to Lave been without
provocation and the result merely of Mill
er's vicious temper.

IkliHer were laborers together at the hop

to pics. Miller insisted that McFcrland
w&s picking hop? on his (Miller's) allotted
tection. There were u. few words, and
t-uddenij- Aliiier pulled a pistol and fired
two thots, one bullet entering the abdo
men end tho other the heart, killing the
eld man almost instantly.
The oiJ man sank to the ground and
Miller Ced. No attention nas paid to the
murderer, as every one rushed to the
wounde<i man's assistance. In the confu
tioa Miller got away and before the offi
cers at Pleai-anton, a mi'.e away, learned
of the shooting the murderer was well
out ot reach.
The killing occurred at 5:33 o'clock, but
Jn the excitement word did not reach the
Sheriff until 10 o'clock. He dirpatched
T'oputies George Wales and Georg-e Tay
lor at once to Pleasanton, as they were
tihoroughly acquainted with the country
into which Miller is suppoi-ed to have dis
appeared.
The murdered man's body was taken to
xhe branch Morgue at l'leaÂ«anton where
Coroner Mehrmann mill hold the Inquest.
McFarland had tolti some of the people
at the hopnelds that he came from Oak
land. The police are trying to trace his
r> <=:cience. Nothing is known of Mill.-r
eavÂ« that he said he cam*> from Montana
(-<â¢ v.-ra! weeks ago. At the hopyards he
v.as given a reputation for being an ugiy
and mean tempered man. lie and Mc
i z: i:id had Ix-en working to^rther. oc

thÂ«y were traveling partners. Last night
V.iry had words over some money. This
- aflfr the phontir.g several hop
pickers declared that Miller had threat
ened to shoot them if tliey tried to break
Jn TJjÂ»on his picking section. He had
rather terrorized the laborers In the field,
V..I-: . v,<mf n nnd children alike. Jt was
therefore an easy matter for him to make
his escape.

Native Sons.
Milton A. Nathan and John J. Davis of
Army and Navy Parlor, who have been
appointed trumpeters to Grand Marshal
Costello, have both seen service. Nathan
was trumpeter for Company F of the
First California trumpeters, serving with
his company through the Spanish-Amer
ican war at the Philippines and in the
Filipino uprising, while Davis, who did
not have a chance to so to the front,
but was ready, served as trumpeter in
Company D of the Eighth California Vol
unteers. Both are active Native Sons and
still take an interest in National Guard
affairs.
Army and Navy Parlor, one of the
youngest In this city, proved itself one of
the most generous hosts of all the parlor*?
that entertained during celebration week.
Its headquarters in the Odd Fellows' Hall
were crowded every afternoon and even-
Ing and there was always a good pro
gramme of entertainment.
The Native Daughters.
Last Tuesday night Fremont Parlor of
the Native Daughters of the Golden West
closed its portion of the celebration by a
grand ball In the forestlike headquarters
of Sequoia Parlor at Saratoga Hall.
Despite the inclement weather, the at
tractions at the Mechanics' Pavilion and
elsewhere, there was a good atter.dar.ee,
which enjoyed a carefully prepared pro
gramme of dances and the hospitality of
this very energetic parlor. The function,
an evening dress one, was one of the most
enjoyable of the many given on the last
night of the celebration.
Through the blunder of some one
Minerva Parlor No. 2. which had been as
signed to the right of line in the Native
Daughters' division in accordance with a
rule that all local parlors should be placed
In numerical order, was deprived of its
proper position. This the second oldest
parlor In the organization feels the slight
very much and proposes to nnd out why n
was treated thus.
On the night of the 14th inst. San Lu
sita Parlor, N. D. G. W., of San Luis
Oblspo gave a social In Its tastefully
decorated hall. Evergreens, the national
and the parlor colors prevailed. In a
bower made up of flowers, smilax and
palms there were served between dances
icecream and lemonade. Miss Agnes Lee
and Miss Maude Scott -were respectively
floor and assistant floor managers. Mi3se3
Steenbeck. Kluver, Post, Hourihan, Rose
lip and Thomson composed the reception
committee. Ji , .
The ladies of Calaveras Parlor, who
paraded last Monday with Army and
Navy Parlor, attired in a natty costume
of blue, semi-military, and wearing fa
tigue hats, were the observed of all ob
servers, not only on account of the neat
ness of the costume worn and regularity
of step, but on account of the beauty of
the general membership. A cynic was
heard to remark: "I have seen many
gatherings of Native Daughters, and
while I have seen some beautiful women
there, I never saw so great an aggrega
tion of beautiful women in one parlor as
I just saw in Calaveras Parlor.'
On Thursday afternoon twenty Native
Daughters gave a luncheon to Grand
President Mrs. Ema, Gett at one of the
first-class rotlsseries. The rooms were
lavishly decorated with pink and white
roses, and the same kind of flowers and;
smilax were used to decorate the tables.
After the menu there were addresses by
the grand president, Past Grand Presi
dent Mrs. Lena H. Mills,* Past Grand
President Mrs. Mnry E. Tlllman, Mrs.
Minnie Gunzendorfer, Mrs. Agnes Lun
stedt. Past Grand Treasurer Mi?s
Eliza D. Keith, Mrs. Agnes McKay, Mrs.
Harry Meyers, Mrs. C. F. Kapp and Mrs.
A. D." Coddlngton. Several of those pres
ent enlivened the affair with songs and
all did honor to the guest of the occasion.
During Mrs. Gett's stay in this city her
suite of rooms was decorated each day
with beautiful flowers sent by Calafla
Parlor, of which she Is a member, by
other parlors and by personal friends.
The choice of Miss Emma. Anderson,
third vice president of Buena Vista Par
lor, N. D. G. W., to represent California

are very proud that she was chosen.

The most distressing phase of all this Indescribable mlsery
was the little children, who seem to be In constant agony,
Internal and external. They did not cry aloud, because they
lacked the vital inner force for such effort. Though their
faces were constantly crying no sound was heard, and as we
looked at these innocent, helpless little things, so emaciated,
hollow-templed, sunken-eyed, the nape of the neck so snarply
indented under the skull that the head looked abnormally
large and ill-supported, the burden of sympathetic grief became
almost unbearable. Sometimes tears rolled down their cheeks,
and the mother, sitting next to this child/would wipe the
tears away with a part of her dirty, filthy garment, and some
thing like a sigh , would . escape to indicate the depth of sor
row that was laying hold upon her heart
I Houseless and homeless these unfortunates sleep in the
streets of Bombay at night. They He down Just where they
happen to find themselves when tiredness overtakes them,
and It is no exaggeration to say'thkt I have seen as many
as 500 sleep on the sidewalk of a single block, lying so closely
that it was almost impossible to thread one's way througn
the maze. In the less frequented Btreets they sleep also in
the driveways, and In order to drive through without accident
It is necessary to send an advance courier to wake up the
sleepers. Of course they have neither bed nor covering, and
to see the little ones cuddle up to their mothers Is one of
the most pathetic, touching sights that I have ever witnessed.
Every effort has been put forth by the city to disperse the
hungry crowds and return them to the country, but necessity
recognizes no law, and desperation yields to no entreaties.
What they want is bread, bread, bread, for themselves and
their loved ones, and the city Is their last hope. If that falls
them they must perish, and if die they must they may as
well die there as elsewhere.
most persistent In their entreaties were the nursing mothers,
and nearly every othrr woman belonged to that class, and the
saddest sight of all was the poor child-mothers, themselves in
need of maternal attention, hugging their emaciated, hollow
templed and sunken-eyed babies with an intensity of affection
that almost broke our hearts to witness, particularly in view
of our utter helplessness to relieve their distress.

In which countless thousands have already perished of
cholera, plague, dysentery and starvation, and as
many more are doomed to a like fate, says Dr. Louis
Klopsch In the Philadelphia North American. How
to describe It so as to bring: it within the grasp of
the human mind I know not Twenty thousand new
cases of cholera weekly, with 75 per cent mortality,
representing 15.000 deaths every seven days; plague on
every hand, dysentery mowing down its victims right and left,
and starvation staring millions boldly and defiantly in the
face, reaping a harvest unprecedentedâ these tell the horrible
story as accurately as a brief prose summary of Milton's
"Paradise Lost" would convey a sense of its poetic sublimity.
The skeleton may be there, but the soul Is wanting.
On the day of our arrival in Bombay the streets were liter
ally crowded with walking skeletons. Every step of the way
we were beset and besieged by men, women and children in the
last stages of destitution, piteously begging for a mite that
they might eat and live. They prostrated themselves before
us, calling upon us as "the protectors of the poor, our father
and mother, our king and our God," to save them from star
vation. >-
They lifted up their hands in earnest supplication and ut
tered their petitions while vigorously slapping their naked, hol
low stomachs to Indicate that for a long time they had had noth
ing to eat. They held out their hands with a beseeching look,
hoping that we might drop a coin that would purchase at least
enough food to satisfy their hunger Just for an hour. Gaunt
men, emaciated women, with parched bosoms, with nursing,
diminutive, hollow-eyed, sickly babies; children with legs and
arms like clothespins and every rib plainly, visibleâ all ran to-

PUNCXOATION-fT. B. G.. City. The
use of the comma in punctuation la one
about which there is a great difference
of opinion, but the better method is to
omit the comma, except in those cases
where Us Insertion would prevent ambig
uity. The general rule, in a sentence like
"manufacturers cf crackers candy and
macaroni." is to place a comma after
"crackers" and avoid a comma before
"and." The fact that 'one grammar says
that in such a sentence there ought to be
a comma before the word "and" is no
proof of its correctness, as there are any
number of grammars and works on punc
tuation that hold the other way. If any
number of volumes are examined with
reference to placing a comma before
"and" when three or more words placed
In the same category are connected there
will be found in some "Faith, and hope,
and charity," while in others there will
be found "Faith and hope and charity."
There is no positive authority with re
gard to placing a comma before "and."
BANKS AND BANK BILLSâ W. A.,
Berkeley; CaL It appears that banks
were in existence in Rome, Greece, Baby
lon, China and other ancient places be
fore the Christian era. The earliest rec
ords of European banks now in existence
are those of the Bank of Venice, founded
in A D. 1711: the Bank of Barcelona,
founded in 1401; the Bank of Geneva,
founded in 1407, and the Bank of Amster
dam in 1609. The oldest bank notes of
which there is any record were issued in
China as far back as 2fc>7 B. C. The Chi
nese called it "flying money," and they

One day (a legal correspondent writes)
before the late Lord Chief Justice took
sick, he was sitting in court, when an
other barrister, leaning acros3 the benches
during the h. oaring of a trial for bigamy,
whispered. "Russell, what's the extreme

Washington Star.
The pretty woman hasn't all the pood
tnlrig3 in life," remarked a plain woman
recently. "She misses one thing-, cer
tainlyâthe comfort cf ugliness. To bo
sure, she has to be old enough to have
philosophized a bit about life before she

ins because the skin-deep gift of the gods
has been denied her. But by and by she
begins to see that her plain features. If
they haven't brought her joy. have spared
her pain. 'In the first place, she hasn"t
expected much of the world, and so she
has not been disappointed. Then she haa
had leisure from her mirror and her ad
mirers, and, most of all, from herself, to
think some thoughts -worth thinking and
to Uo a little something of solid worth.
The worst slave I ever knew was a re
markably pretty girl who was always in
terror lest she was not at her beauty's
best and whose whole life was a round of
severe self-exaction3 that she might keep
her beauty unimpaired. The poor child
actually found time for nothing else in life
than the office of being her own groom.
"Best of all, the plain woman Is reason
ably sure to escape the observation and
comment that are sure to follow a pretty

her. if she be sensible and righ:-min<ietl,

XEW YORK. Sept- 15.â The same factors
which cauEed the break In prices in yesterday
afternoon's Etock market continued in force to
day and more business was done during the two
hours of the Saturday short session than on any
full day for months. Liquidation was plainly in
evidence and the bear operations added their
selling to the burden of the market in the
confidence that lower prices would enable them
to cover at a profit. The declines which they
brought about in this way uncovered many
stor-loea orders, which had been placed in the
market as a precautionary measure by recent
speculative buyers. The points of weakness
made It evident that the liquidation' was large
ly of speculative accounts. In People's Gas
there is a large Ehort account already ar.d the
demand to cover waa large enough to keep that
Btuck comparatively steady until near the close.
Otherwise the weakness was quite general and
evenly distributed. The principal railroad
stocks are down from 1 to lÂ«i, the coalers,
syaagerÂ«. Pacifies and trunk lines are the prln- 'Â¦
cipal sufferers. The steel stocks and the lead- l
in? epeclakies show the same range of losses.
These were extended from 2 to 3 points In
Sugar, Tobacco. Metropolitan. General Elec
tric Northwestern, Krie first preferred and
Baltimore and Ohio preferred. The bear trad
ers covered In some stocks, but in others the
telling continued in large volume to the close,
which was active and weak. The lethargy of
the stock market was unrelieved during the
week and the limited activity and the narrow
movements of prices were nothing more than
ripples on the surface of a deep and stagnant
pool. The puzzled brokers have seen one and
another cause assigned for the torpidity
eliminated by events. Last week the Ver
mont election and this week the Maine
election were expected by the sanguine to
start the market. But on neither occa
sion wa* any effect perceptible beyond a half
. hour of professional trading. Borne positive
pressure has resulted from the declaration of
the anthracite miners* strike, but the effect on
prices, even in the group of coal carrying rail
roads, has been 6mall. While the possibilities
cf harm to values threatened by the strike are
fully recognized there Is an optimistic -feeling
in Wall street that the disaffection either will
not spread far or will be adjusted before U
goes to extremes. ,
The week's events have resulted in some
hardening of money rates in Xew York and the
tone is significantly firmer. Early in the week
it became known that preparations had been
made by a member of the British loan syndi
cate to ship gold this week to meet the in- |
jFtallment due on subscriptions to the loan, but
the volume of cotton bills brought on the ex- I
change market broke the rate and frustrated '
the Intention to ship gold. Apparently the |
Erltlsh loan ryndicate is under a contingent or
Implied obligation to facilitate gold shipments !
arid with further installments due on Â«ub- I
scrlptions In the middle of next month and
November there will recur the possibility of
gold shipments. Later In the week It was an
nounced that New York bankers had sub
scribed to a new German loan to theamount of
S20.Of>A.O00. Kxperts estimate that the country's
credit balance abroad Is ample to meet such
a subscription by drawing exchange without |
gold shipments, but It was assumed that tho
subscriptions are to be paid In part at least
in gold, as in the case of the British exchequer j
bonds subscribed for here, the transaction be
ing In the nature of a special contract to meet I
the urgent need of replenishment of gold re- j
serves. This surmise was strengthened by the I
fact that the principal bank among the sub
scribers held upward of $10,000,000 surplus cash
abovÂ« the legal reserve and S3 per cent of its
reserve was In gold._ As this bank's ten mil
lions surplus makes up the ratio to twenty mil
lions of the total surplus of all the sixty-three
clearing-house banks, the face of the New
York money market is materially altered.
London also has suddenly awakened to the
realization that the Bank of England has
acted with fore-knowledge In Its vigorous op
position to the policy of lenders in the outside
market and London discount rates have turned
upward. The new German loan has as a back
ground the large Russian lean peeking a mar
ket and further British emissions of some kind
for military expenditures. It is evident also
that while Xew York banks have been ex
panding their loans to foreign borrowers, the
demands upon the New York market have
been largely met by Interior banks out of their
abundance; bo that now, with the movement of
the crops the fall demand upon Xew? York for
funds are approaching the normal. Operations
under the refunding law have practically
ceased and with them the resultant benefit to
the money market. The question of a squeeze I
in money ratÂ«Â»s in New York depends on these !
factors and the further receipts of Alaskan and
Australian gold. But the mere existence of the
question unsolved effectually discourages specu
lation In the New York etock market, where
memories are still fresh of last December's
money panic.
Bonds have lain practically dormant all week.
1 United States new 2s have advanced %, the
old 4s %. the refunding 2s, when issued, and the
*.s *i and the 3s 1 per cent In the bid prices.

Movements of Specie,
NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â The Financier Bays:
"The two factors outlined in this paper's
analysis of the New York bank statement a
weÂ«>k ago, namelyâ the rapid expansion In loans
and reduction in cash holdings in response to
interior crop demands â have resulted in a fur
ther shrinkage of the surplus reserve of the
clearing-house institutions for the current eix
day period. The loss in cash was $4,931,200,
traceable > for the most part to shipments of
currency by the banks, although they also lost
in the routine operations with the eubtreasury.
As an ordinary rule the reduction In cash low
ers reserve requirements to a certain extent by
lessening deposits, but in the present Instance
loans expanded over $7,000,000 and as deposits
actually increased $1,003,500 the reserve require
ments are something like a quarter of a mil
lion higher than a wenk ago and the surplus
shows a fall of $5,220,175, bringing the total to
$20,836,175. This, however, is ?20.5CO.000 over the
excess at this time last year and about $16,S0O,
000 larger than in 1S98. The receipts in the loan
Hem were larger than expected, the Increase
being rather well distributed. Stock ex
change business has not been heavy enough
to call for the expansion and commer
cial interest!* have shown only ordinary activ
ity. International operations and business with
the interior are probably responsible for the
heavier totals. For all that present loans are
the heaviest in the history of the clearing-house
and deposits are nearly at a maximum, money
rates are still easy and show but few signs of
hardening. A repetition of the current state
ment, however, will doubtlessly have a de
cided influence on the market. The placing of
a new German loan at this center will not dis
turb the situation other than temporarily, as
present arrangements do not favor an actual
expert of specie. The current balance In favor
of the United States Is steadily growing from
month to month and will amount to much high
er figures before the close of the year. The
banks are still taking out new circulation, the
week's gain having been $372,000."

With the enlargement of the field of
operations In oil has come a demand for
the employment of hundreds of hands in
diverse ways. There are tools to be made,
machinery to be' manufactured and re
paired, wells to be drilled, and a thou
sand and one details, all giving: employ
ment. As the Pacific Oil Reporter truly
points out, the needed tools and machin
ery can be better manufactured In this
State now that petroleum has supplied a
substitute for high-priced coal. Shops at
Los Angeles and at Bakersfleld have done
a lively repairing business. Bakerfleld's
shop facilities are about to be Increased.
The Ventura Free Press says that Ven
tura County, one of the oldest oil-produc
ing districts In the State, is now one of
the most active. In that field the Union
Oil Company owns large holdings. The
Bard Oil and Asphalt Company is about
to begin operations on the land recently
obtained from Thomas R. Bard. In the
by actual practical trial. When oil was
first used it was blown with 2 per cent or
3 per cent of generated steam, but this
pave an imperfect flame and set up a
vibration. Now 8 per cent is used and a
bunsen flame i3 obtained with little vibra
tion. The flreroom cost of handling oil ia
flpured at one-third less than the cost of
handling coal. There are no ashes, no
dirt, no smoke and less heat is lost by ra
diation.
. William Tremble and Joaquln Fonts,
lnborcrs employed' at the Union Iron
Works, wero. unloading castings from a
car yesterday morning when one of them
slipped from itss fastening and fell upon
the two men.. They were taken to the

his ribs broken, hla chest contused and
was suffering: from internal Injuries.
Fonts escaped with a contused 1 chest and

Mrs. Sarah Cohn. a widow, residing at
1450 O'Farrell street, was severely Injured
Sunday last by being thrown off a Oeary
streot car at the curve where the car
turnsfrom Point Lobos Into Fourth ave
nue. * Mrs. -Cohn was returning from
the park and was riding on the dummy.
When the. car, which was going at full
speed, suddenly turned tho curve tho lady
was pitched off, landing on top- of her
head on the hard roadway. She was re
moved to the French Hospital in an un
conscious condition. This is not the first
accident that has occurred at thia curve.
The Century Oil Company has pur
rhased from William T. Sesnon of San
Francisco forty acres of land in the Kern
field. It is described as the southwest

tion 24, 28, 27. The price paid' was $4000.

Men who talk oil and hunt oil and sell oil
n.nd buy oil and oil lands are still talking of
the big deal In which Senator Bard turned over
to Ix>s Angeles capitalists 6066 acres that lie
owned In the heart of the great oil belt in Ven
t'.ira County. The syndicate paid $300,000 for
this tract of land, and besides gave the Senator
an Interest valued at JJO.OOO, but it Is not gen
erally known what this oil right cost Senator
Hard. He purchased the right in 1S77, accord
ing to the records, from J. P. Green, a promi
nent and wealthy lawyer of Philadelphia, who
had acquired, with Tom Scott, large holdings
In Vf ntura County, and the amount paid by the
Senator to tho 1'liiladelphlan, according to the
records, was exactly $K3 33. The Ventura man
held the land for exactly twenty-three years,
but it is plain that he did not hold In vain
when a comparison Is made between the pur
chase and the selling prices. As Colonel SeJIers
once remarked "There's millions In it!" This
applies to the oil business In California as well
an to other thtnes.
A Los Angeles paper tells how Senator
Bard has made money in oil lands as fol
lows:
Five wells have been drilled at San
Pedro. At Morena there are two com
panies at work with two others about to
begin. The ocean front, from the mouth
of the San Luis Rey River to La Costa,
has been leased to the New York OH
Company.
Track-laying Is reported to have begun
on the spur up Wills Canyon, In the Kern
River district. When that is completed
shipments will be largely increased.
Xhe Bakersfleld Callfornlan says that In
a number of instances in the- Kern River
field wells, which were not considered -to
b*Â» first-class, have been largely increased,
sometimes double, by reperforating.
The latest report of such result comes
from the Mount Diablo Company on 30
25-2$. No. 1 was recently perforated for
the third time. Previously it was inter
mittent, going from thirty to eighty bar
rels a day. but never more. After treat
ment, however, it yielded 140 barrels each
day for a week and has now settled down
to 130.
Over 71.000 shares of stock were sold on the
floor of the Los Angeles Oil Exchange yester
day, the second largest day's business in the
history of the local oil market. Of the 71,000
shares that - changed hands, the market value
of which was $S132 60, just 25,600 shares were
of listed stocks and 45,5<Â¥) of unlisted. Prices
still show a downward tendency, and while the
declines from day to day are small in the ag
gregate they have amounted to considerable.
Southern Consolidated now sells for almost
half the price at which It was once active.
The same Is true of "Wentlake, Uncle Sam and
many others. Conditions governing the actual
value of securities are sound enough, but they
are not Influential as market factors. In a
market that Is purely local, and where It 1b
possible to dispose of 100 shares at a time,
speculative values will always be easily
changed.
The Los Angeles Times of the 14th lnst.
had the following concerning transactions
in thtf Los Angeles Oil Exchange:
same district the Ojal Oil Company con
trols 1547 acres of oil land on Sulphur
Mountain. East of the Ojal property the
Santa Ana Oil Company is operating.
North of the Bard Company's prop
erty are ' the holdings of,* the
Santa Paula Oil Company. The* Capi
tal Crude Oil Company and the Leone
Oil Company are working In the district
several miles north of the town of New
hall and good wells have been struck still
farther east.
Many causes are making a greater de
mand for petroleum as fuel a certainty.
The London newspapers. In view of the
expected shortage of coal, are favoring
t{ie use of petroleum. The Petroleum Re
view, published in London, says that a
strike of miners means a slackening of
the supply of coal and, if the strikers are
Welsh miners, of steam coal. So many
uses have been found for petroleum that
it is difficult to instance conditions under
which it is not available for fuel. An
account was given in The Call some weeks
ago of the Russian method for utilizing
petroleum in smelting precious ores. The
California Powder Works has been burn
ing petroleum successfully for more than
a decade. The railways are continually
providing for greater consumption in their
locomotives. Factories are adopting it
largely in this city and at other Pacific
Coast points. At the shops of the South
ern Pacific Company at Ogden there was
recently Installed a 36-horsepowe.r Diesel
motor, by means of which it is expected
to supply power for the machine shops
through the use of crude California petro
leum. The great strike, of coal miners in
the East may be a factor In suggesting
extended use of petroleum for domestic
purposes.
Ernst A. Denicke, discussing Â¦ in the
Mining and Scientific Press the uses of
California crude petroleum, describes its
application as fuel by the California Pow
der Works. It is used to make steam and
In the manufacture of chemicals for com
pounding dynamite. The oil is pumped
through an underground pipe from the
Union Oil Company's refinery abovo Ro
dt-o and is stored in receptacles made of
old glycerine tanks. These tanks have
one end cut out and are loosely closed
by a wooden top covered with burlap.
From here the oil is discharged to the
various furnaces at a head of about twen
ty-two feet. About 5 per cent of steam is
used to blow. Saving :s effected In both
price of fuel and in the amount of labor
needed. When the furnaces are once
lighted they need practically no attention,
except an occasional glance to see that
the proper flame is obtained. The boilers
are of the ordinary tubular make, four in
; number. The flame Is shot under them.
In a" great manufacturing concern in
this city, where 700 barrels of oil arc
burned per diem, the oil Is pumped from
steel storage tanks, each of lO/XW barrels
capacity, into two 3-lnch stand pipes by
two pumps. The boilers, numbering
thirty-two, are arranged in two rows,
facing each other, and the oil pipe from
the stand pipe runs along the front of
them. Kach stand pipe supplies a separ
ate row, but could supply both rows in
case of accident. At a distance of every
threo boilers these two | feed pipes are
connected with a cross-arm pipe, so that
in case an accident happens to â¢ one of the
boilers thrÂ«Â» of thorn can bc instantly cut
out without stopping the plant for a mo
ment. This alone is a great advantage
over a coal tiro, for it takes some time
to "pull" a bis Hre. The stand pipes,
pumps and feed pipes are all set up In
duplicate, so that an accident cannot stop
the plant. A network of firebrick set on
edge is laid directly upon tho grate bars,
and against this the oil flame is shot. If
anything should to the oil supply
this network can be removed and a coal
tire Btarted within twenty-five minutes,

In 1881 and a shipmate of his was a sailor
on the Antiope about the' fame year.
Yesterday they began arguing as to
whether the ship lyinj; outside the train
ing ship Marion was the Alelanope or the

decided to settle the question at once,
so, stripping off his clothes, he swam
down to the vessel In* dispute, lie called
for a rope and climbed aboard, delighted
to find himself in the right. lie wanted

final cuts now===deeper than before=âfor it's moving: time
the following urgent instructions were issued to each department manager last
week: "we have only a short time more in the old store â positively close out every-
thing possible now â we have new goods enough for the new store â therefore reduce
prices on present stocks â we prefer selling to movingâ it saves expense." this
simply means additional savings to you, for the department managers have cut
deep â on many lines very deep, our counters and windows tell the story better
than we can here â fop seeing is believing, every department comes under the
edict, for we realize fully what a tremendous job it is to move a stock of such
magnitude, the new prices â coupled with your appreciation â will lighten the
moving burden, this week records the shortest prices on Hale's good goods in
our history â you know what that means â our loss now â means a saving later.
