DETAILS OF STORMING OF PEKING.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19. â The Japanese Minister, Mr.
Takahira, late last night received the following advices
from the Japanese Foreign Office at Tokio:
"The Japanese Consul at Chefu wired under date of Au
gust 17 to the following effect: 'The foreign forces attacked on
the eastern side of Peking Wednesday morning. The enemy ob
stinately replied. In the evening the Japanese blew up the Chih
hwa grate and the Tung-chili gate of the Tartar City and suc
ceeded in enfering. In the meantime ; other foreign forces - en
tered the Chinese City by the Tung Pien gate. Detachments
were sent immediately to the legations and opened communica
tions. The Ministers and staffs were found safe. The Japanese
loss was over 100, including three officers, namely, Captain
Michilve and Lieutenant Watanabe wounded, while Lieutenant
Yazak was killed. The Chinese loss is computed at about 400/ "
Substantially the information contained in the above dis
patch was received in press dispatches yesterday direct from
Tokio. It contains the explicit and reassuring statement that the
Ministers and staff were found safe. It is more direct and com
plete in detail than the American advices thus far received.
Fighting Continues in the Streets of the Chi

Safety of the Ministers and Their Staffs.
ROME, Aug. 19. â A dispatch from Taku via Chefu, Au

Dowager Empress."

Hon. R. M. White Declares That Eng

Much of Alaska.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Aug. 19.â Hon.
Richard Mar.sfieM Wl,ite, explorer and
mine owner, son of Richard Grant White,
ihe ICew York scientist, has created a
en the coast by declaring that
the -whole of the Klondike. is American.
He first makes the point that the interna
tional boundary, where tbe Alaska dis
pute is now going on, cannot be less thin
len marine leagues from the sea. He also
contends as a result of this that the
whole Yukon Valley. Including Klon
dike, according to the mountain summit
scheme, ehould be pan of Alaska proper
and In the domain of the United States.
In an Interview YÂ»"hite says:
"The only range cf mountains the sum
mits of which extend la a direction paral
lel to the coast from the fifty-sixth de
gree cf north latitude to the point of in
tersection of the one hundred and forty
first degree of west lonsritude is .the
Rocky Molunta'ns and I think that no one
Till! dispute that they are a true summit
or divide, as no waters crops over them.
I3y making the Rocky Mountain divide or
furr.mit as the boundary the whole V"u
knn territory would belong to the United
States, and as our British neighbor?
wn to bÂ« willing to adjust and to change
boundary lines I think that it would be
well to suggest that ihe whole question
of boundaries be thrown open for settle
ment and that we should take all that
part of Canada north of the United Stai3Â«
and west of the divide or the Rocky
Mountains, including the island's off th*
coast in the Pacific Ocean. This wouid
give the United State? not more than we
ere certainly entitled to. although for a
period of time we have allowed the Brit
ish to occupy it and to collect taxes
within it. The British themselves have
raised the Question of boundary and
have disturbed the peaceful rest which ex
isted by their encroachments. If they come
out of the contest with less territory than
they went in with thev will have tne con
solation of knowing that an immediate im
provement of the people will take place in
prosperity and happiness."

to endanger American lives and property.
United States troops -will not be -landed.
"This Government," said a high official
of the administration this afternoon,
"claims and will exorcise the right to land
troops alone'or in concert; with the other
powers, at any "point in' China 'where
American lives or American interests may
be : in' danger. Since the 'United States
claims this 'right for herself, she 'could
not deny it to others nor question-tho
right of Great Britain to land forces in
Shanghai to protect British interests. If
the . conditions should become : such that
American interests could only, be'"ade
quately projected by" the presence -of
American troops, they would doubtless be
landed; but the United States would not
join with the other nations in .landing
a force at Shanghai simply because Great
Britain had seen fit to do so. The same
statement applies to the situation at Nlu
chwang. While the -United^ States will
avoid getting into any complications at
Shanghai, the officials of the administra
tion recognize that the conditions there
are. such as seriously to e'ndanger the con
tinued harmonious action of. the powers.
This Government will not. by any. act.
indicate that Great Bri tuln is suspected
of any motive other than that of affording
protection to foreign interests in landing
troops, but "if is plain that some of the
others powers suspect her. of plans to ac
quire either territory or predominating in
fluence in the Yangtse .Valley, or so pre
tend, in order to justify . themselves in
earrylng out territorial ?-. designs which
they may have elsewhere, in China-"
No; news was received- at. the State or
Navy Departments to-day throwing any
light on the Shanghai situation. The
New Orleans. Princeton and Castine are
at 'Shanghai, and naval officers say that
the number of -vessels there will probably
be kept at three to show the foreign Gov
?Â» rnn ?S nts : that the United States, though
It will not land troops. Is Â¦ not indifferent
to events at Shanghai. The Â¦ authorities
understand that the French 'will land a

that many Boers have broken the oath to

buildings on farms where the enemy or
his scouts are harbored will be liable to
be razed.

ADMIRAL REMEY'S REP3RT
SURPRISES WASHINGTON
Continued from First Page.
Chinese should make their final stand
there. Prior to the receipt of the dispatch
It was accepted generally as a fact that
the Dowager Empress, in company with
the Emperor and a large suite, had left
Pt-king. While nothing is said in Admiral
Remey's advices as to the whereabouts
Â«>f the Emperor, it is deemed scarcely
probable that he left the city without the
Empress Dowager.
Some doubt. of the accuracy of the in
formation received by Admiral Remey is
expressed, particularly *as the Chinese
Minister. Mr. Wu. is very positive that
the Emperor, Empress Dowager and the
entire Chinese court left Peking beforo
the arrival at -the gates of the allies. Min
ister Wu said to-day that he had offltial
advices to the effect that the Emperor
find Empress Dowager had gone from Pe
king to the province of Shensi. a consid
erable distance west of the capital city. He
had not been advised as to what city they
had gone, but said it was probable their
destination was the capital of Shensi
province. The- Minister believed they
were .entirely. out'Of danger. The state
ment that the Dowager Empress was de
tained by Prince Yungedo, therefore, gave
him little concern; although he expressed
some Interest tn it. He said there was
no Chinese Prince Yungedo. It is not a
Chinese name. It might be, the Minister
thought, a Japanese name, but person
ally he knew -of no such person.
Young Lu the Empress' Jailer.
At the Japanese legation the dispatch
cf Admiral Remey was read with the
deepest Interest. There, too. it was said
that Yungedo was not a Chinese name.
No Japanese official of % that, name was
known to the legation attaches. - Their
solution of the question Is that the .name 1
ehould be Yung Lu. He Is the command
er In chief of the Chinese imperial troops
and is said > to have strong pro-foreign
Inclinations and sympathies. No'conjec
ture was offered as to the reason for the
detention of: the Dowager Empress by
him.: Among Washington officials it is
regarded as hardly likely that the Em

Chinese officials. If ebe be- !n: Peking at ;

'KANSAS CITY, Aug. 19.â Two-thirds of
Kansas west of the three easternmost
tiers of counties ' is experiencing one of
the most severe . droughts in the history
of the State and the opinion is that the
Kansas corn crop will be the. smallest in
Â¦proportion to Its. requirements for feed
ing that has been raised In many years.
In 1899 there were 225.000.000 bushels.
Secretary Coburn's report of conditions
in August indicated a yield this year of
about 145,000,000. Since then there have
been two weeks of hot weather which
has further materially reduced conditions
and the most liberal estimates of well
Informed men on 'change do not exceed
100 000,000 bushels, while many place the
crop at not over 75.000.000 bushels. The
Plowing for winter wheat is delayed by
the dry condition of the soil. Pastures
are dry and stock water in many cisterns
is scarce. - _â¢â¢

Short Indeed.

stood the catalfalque, .a counterpart of
that in which the dead monarch was re
cently laid to rest in Rome. Over it was
thrown a heavy black pall, edged with
white, and on top was a great garland of
laurels and gala leaves, tied with flow
ing ribbons of red, white and green, the
colors of Italy. At the head and foot of
the casket tall candelabra burned and
the morning sun, coming through the
chancel window, fell athwart this somber
memorial. A superb Â¦> wreath of purple
asters and roses, sent by the British Em
bassy, rested alongside the casket.
The church had been decorated elabo
rately for the occasion. Around the
sanctuary and on all sides rose a mass of
palms and foliage plants, while the beau
tiful white marbl* altar stood out from
a nest of palms.
Â¦WASHINGTON, Aug.; 19.â Amid scenes
of impressive solemnity, and in the pres

Ministers of foreign countries and a great
concourse of people from civil life, me
morial services for the late King Hum

Catholic Church at 11 o'clock to-day. The
announcement; of 'the services; was made
by the Italian' Embassador, Baron Fava.
and with the co-operation of the State
Department the event was given a dis
tinctly official character. . The foreign
representatives were in full . diplomatic
uniform, and these, with - the Â¦ brilliant
uniforms of the British, German, Aus
trian and other military attaches -and of
the - American generals and admirals,
gave- a touch of brilliant , coloring to the
solemn pageantry. <
Just at 11 o'clock President McKinley

strains of the orjran floated through the
edifice and the black and white robed
acolytes led the procession of priesta to
the altar. It had been expected that Car

sence in the South prevented his betns
present. The celebrant of the mass was
Rev. Father Barth. assisted by Rev.
Father Lee as deacon and Rev. Father
Kervlck as sub-deacon.
Father Chantell of Georgetown TXn! r
versity was also in the sanctuary. The

sermon bfing omitted. At the close of
the mass the priests put aside their white
vestments for those of black, and de
scending from the sanctuary moved about
the casket, sprinkling it with holy water,
praying for the repose of the soul of the
dead King and chanting the "RequiescaL
tn Pace." - Â¦* r.. x .,!_ Â¦Â¦ .
At the close of the service the Presi

the body not being found until early this

ery when he came home after midnight.
The woman's body lay face downward.
Near by on the floor was a bloody ham
mer, and the rooms had been ransacked
of everything of value. It Is the opinion
of the police that a thief entered the
house and was surprised in his work by
the woman and that he killed her to
prevent identification.
GEORGETOWN, Ky., Aug. 19.-Caleb
Powers Issued a statement to the publlo
to-night In which he says:
"That one of the greatest Judicial farces
known to history has been enacted here In
my trial, under the forms of law, no well
Informed man can doubt. Innocence is no
shield with $100,000 and the methods ot
Caropbelllsm against you. The rectitude
of one's past life counts for naught They
say Taylor Is guilty because he was at
his ofHce, and that I am guilty because
i I was away from mine. This has been
a political trial throughout for political
purposes, and no greater mistake has been
made by the Democratic party since they
robbed us of the offices to which we 'were
fairly elected by the people. From tho
beginning of the campaign until now I
have stood with what little of merit I
have had for the rights and liberties of
the people. That Is my crime. This is
the only offense I have committed. That
Is the only thing they have proven
against me. I swore to that myself In
testimony. I have never had, and I now
have, no apology to make for being true
to the trust Imposed upon me by a major
ity of the voters of this State. History
will draw Its dark lines around those who
have outraged me and disgraced the ju
diciary and blackened the history of the i
State."
The case of Henry Youtsey will be
called to-morrow, but as the defendant
has not fully recovered It Is not certain
whether the case will go to trial. As
much \t not more difficulty is expected
In securing a jury as In the Powers case,

"I address these survivors of four

the results of which may have most im

"Who shall say that this is not a fight
ing nation? From Concord and Lexington
and Cambridge to the final great contest
at Yorktown, from Perry's victory to New
Orleans, from Vera Cruz to the City of
Mexico, in the Civil War, in Cuba and in
the Philippines, there have laid down their
lives for pure- love of country, not
actuated by personal ambitions or driven
by imperial edicts, more men than there
are to-day inhabitants of any proud city
of our land. This is indeed a fighting
nation.

memory from the entire city. Sel

witnessed so erand and' so Impressive a
demonstration.
The flags of the whole city were at half
mast. Soldiery and civic and fraternal
societies and thousands of the fellow
townsmen of the de'eeased united In the

taps brought tears to the eyes of the
thousands who stood silently around with
uncovered heads.

And yet the funeral was much more
than military. The services In Mechanics'
Pavilion and at the grave were In charge
ot California Lodge Ko. 1, Free and Ac

The casket was borne to the catafalque
In front of the platform that had been
erected in the west end of thÂ« Pavilion.
California- Lodge followed It, and after
the Masons the soldiers entered the hall,
and then the doors were thrown open to
the public. In an Incredibly short time
the throng filled the Pavilion until all th<j
seats were occupied and many were com
pelled to stand.
California Ixsdge was seated to the

Proceedings in the Courts for a
Separation Are Instituted by
His First "Wife in
Chicago.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Aug. 19.â The Rev. C.
O. Brown, whese sensational church trial
etirred San Francisco a 'few years ago,
is la the city Â¦with Mrs. Brown number
two. His first wife quietly petitioned for
divorce In Chicago about two months ago.
Tho style of the case was Mary Brown
vs. Cliarles Brown, and the grounds for
separation were alleged cruelty. Just after
the case came up for cjudlcatlon, how
ever, the pleadings were so changed that
they read. "Mary Brown vs. Charles O.
Brown," ud the charge was changed
from cruelty to adultery-
The divorce was granted, and the Rev.
Mr. Brown on August 6 married Mrs.
JJary Malloy, a weaJthy and well-known
lady. Crown came here a few days ago
to attend the annual reunion of the Third
Ohio Cavalry, of which he was a member.
Tbe couple arc stopping a.t the Jefferson
Hotel, and will return to Chicago In a
few days. He has given up the ministry,
for the present at least. So quietly was
the divorce secured and the second mar
riage performed that it was never made
public until the visit to this city.
The divorce and remarriage of Dr.
Brown will nowhere cause more surprise
than in San Francisco, where both him
self and his wife were well known. The
Hnrwns had a preat many friends on both
n<>s of the bay. and when the scandal
trost and all his acquaintances fell away
from the disgraced minister the couragre
with which bis wife helped him face his
dotraoterp and her unf.inchlng support of
him was responsible larrely for a certain
revulsion of fe^oling- !n his favor. JCo sus
picion was ever felt by any one that
knew the Erowns that they were drifting
cpart. and tho news of the rupture of
their marital relation* will form a basis
for a nreat deal of comment.
COURTS ARE CRITICIZED
BY THE REV. W. E. DUGAN
Tlie Well-Known Pastor Forcibly
States They Are a Befuge
fcr Criminals.
Iicv. 'tv. E. Dufjan. pastor of the Stew
art Memorial Urlted Presbyterian Church,
is of the opinion that the courts of thi3
city are a refuge for criminals. He
preached an a.ble sermon last night, in
Â¦which he severely criticized the courts.
In part he paid:
Albert Holt, whotras convicted of the mur
der of Mary Clute some two year* ago, is to
havf a. new trial. So the supreme wisdom of
the courts decides, because it is said that the
Judpe who originally tried the case wont too
far in giving: his charge to the Jury and com
mented upon the nature of circumstantial evi
dence. This is another* instance among a mul
titude of the paÂ»t that our courts have become
a rÂ« f usf for criminals instead of halls ol Jus
tice to brim? the guilty to punishment.
There are #0 many hi dine places In the law
that the chances of escape for the basest crim
inal ere ETcatly in his favor. And If he is
brought tn Justice it is after years of delay,
when the public has forgotten about the crime
and the effects that punishment of the crim
inal at the proper time would have on the
yublic raind are all lost. We do not believe la
" ::.ob law, yet. mob law is preferable to our
trc-iwrit abuses of Justice. According to our
jirwent system there is euch an array of armed
technicalities that Justice has a desperate fljrlu
to pain entrance to the court room, where she
1? sunoosed to sit enthroned and sway the
ftceptfr of eternal right. Such things only tend
to make crime popular and offer a prize for
wrongdoing.
These dÂ»-lays an1 new trials advertise our
courts r.s fortified cities of refuge for the
villain. Crime Js on the increase and we feel
Justified in saying that that increase is due in
r.art to the present abuses of Justice In our
courts because of the ereat protection Riven
to the criminal. Oh Ood. has our courts become
â¢ slimy den of darkness for the hiding place
of blear-eyed. Woody, thirsty crime, a den so
Intricate In its windings that Justice, with the

BURLESQUE'S OPPORTUNITY.
Even more important than the benefits to the city'
are those which will accrue to the State at large by
this glorious demonstration of what has been achieved;
by California in the fifty years of her history as a" State;
in the Union. The more splendid'the celebration the
wider will be. the publication (given to it in the East,
and the keener, the. attention paid, Vo it by- the people.
It will advertise California's wealth, resources, "enter-
prise and patriotic public spirit in a striking way .and
; attract the minds of capitalists and home-seekers 'alike.
Those*-, who < have not yet contributed to "the fund
should do so at once. The sum of $50,000 is not 'an
excessive amount to ask of a city so large and* so:
wealthy as San Francisco for a purpose ; of such patfi-,
otic? pleasure . and .'utility.- ; This week' should Â» see the
entire amount subscribed. Let every man in propor
tion to 1 , his # means share in the ',. festival and ."willingly !
ioin in "defraying the cost of it
It is not worth while to go over again the benefits
the city will receive irom the celebration. It is now
assured that the display will in every respect surpass
anything of the kind ever witnessed on the Pacific
Coastâ that it will be indeed one ; of the most brilliant
festivals ever given in America. Thousands of visitors
will throng the city to attend it and the result will be
a quickening of activity in all lines of trade.
WHILE there have been; many liberal contribu
tions to the 'Admission day fund, the; full
â¢ amount Â¦desifed^by the committee has not yet
been subscribed. This week renewed;; efforts will be
made to complete the sum of $50,000 expected from
the city. It is to be hoped they will be crowned with
speedy success. ; The date of the celebration is draw
ing near, the work of decoration will begin this week
and ample funds to defray all expenses should.be in
the hands of the committee at once.
ADMISSION vDflY FUND.
" "And' to .that end and purpose and in accordance
with 1 . the resolution adopted by the County Commit
tee this committee declares that no fraud, imposition,^
intimidation or oppression will be tolerated at the
said primary election, and hereby gives -notice that
when} it;. shall appear by satisfactory; proofs that any ;
false .voting, shall ; haye occurred at any polline-blace
For the purpose of assuring to every voter at the
primaries as complete protection as is possible with
out a primary law the County Committee, through its
chairman, "Alfred Bouvicr. has appointed a committee
of eighteen to arrange for the elections. That com
mittee has adopted resolutions setting forth the im
portance of conducting the primaries upon principles
of fair dealing, both as to issues and as to men, and
has devised a means of assuring such fairness. The
resolutions say:
The Republicans of San Francisco will no longer
tolerate boss control of their party.- They have had
experience enough with that kind of political fakers.
They know that Herrin. Crimrriins and Kelly are not
in politics for the maintenance of Republican princi
ples, the good of San Francisco, the interests of Cali
fornia or the welfare of the nation. Those would-be
bosses with â¢ their jrangs of disreputable followers
would not hesitate a moment to betray and defeat Re
publican candidates, even after nominating them, if
they could see in such betrayal any profit for them
selves or for the Southern Pacific Railroad. It is
fresh within the memory of all that they, have be
trayed a Republican candidate for Mayor and a Re
publican candidate' for Governor.
It is well known that the foundation of party gov
ernment is the primaries. If corruption prevail there
then all that follows becomes tainted with the wrong.
The stanchest Republicans of the time, if they per
ceive they have been cheated at the primaries in the
election of delegates to a convention of the party,
lose confidence in the convention itself, and accord
ingly are not. inclined to give an unquestioning sup
port to candidates nominated by it. Honesty at the
primaries is therefore the best policy a party can pur
sue. It is in a particular sense the best policy at this
time, for no other can win.
DESPITE the efforts of Hcrrin, Crimmins and
Kelly to take advantage of the overthrow of
the primary law for the purpose of getting
control of the Republican primaries in this city by
trickery, or by force, there are good reasons for ex
pecting fair dealing in every district. Certainly the
County Committee has thus far taken steps to that
end and there is no likelihood it will turn aside from
that honest purpose between now and election day.

THE WORLD! S WARSHIPS
The United States Navy has been very
fortunate In the selection of water-tube
boilers and has escaped thus far the dif
ficulties experienced in other naviesâpar
ticularly the Britishâ with this modern
Improvement in steam generation. There
are nine different types in use In our
navy, seven of which are chiefly in tor
pedo-boats and destroyers. The list com
prises the following types: Almy, Bab
cock & "Wilcox, Mosher, Normand,
Niclause, Seabury, Thorneycroft, Ward
and Yarrow. The second in the list is al
ready in six cruisers and cunboata and
will be installed In at least three other
large vessels. It will be noted that the
Belleville boiler Is not Included in the list,
and it was only through the most vigor
ous argument against its introduction
that the late Democratic Secretary of the
Navy was persuaded not to foist this boil
er on the Navy. The experiment of try
ing so many boilers of different types Is
a wise and economical proceeding for as
water-tube boilers have become an abso
lute necessity for shlp3 of war. it only re
mains to "select one which practical ex
perience proves to be the best
Only four religious denominations are
recognized in the British navyâ Church of
England, Methodists. Presbyterians and
Roman Catholics. Whichever creed a man
professes when he joins the service he has
to stick to for. the rest of his career. If
his creed is some other than one of the
four above mentioned he is put down for
whichever seems nearest. Only chaplains
of the established church are assigned to
ships and whenever it is practicable the
members of the other three denomina
tions are landed and marched oft to places
of worship belonging to their creeds. All
doubtful cases are counted for Church of
England people, which gives that denomi
nation an undue preponderance on board
ship. But In the old days there was even
less care taken to assort the ship's com
pany and it was no uncommon occurrence
to see a rigid Presbyterian marched off
to attend Roman Catholic service. It Is
the practice In some ships at sea when
the Established Church service !s pro
gressing the Roman Catholics are drawn
up to have read to them the articles of
war.

On Wednesday Irma Rothschild and
congenial friends. He described the table
that groaned with its wealth of plate and
crystal and choice viands and the buffet
piled high with all the good things that
appeal to the appetite of man. Then he
came to the speeches. "The host spoke
first." said Lloyd. "He referred to the
wealth, the plenty the good Lord had
showered upon him and with humility de
clared that in the midst of all his abun
dance he would remember the poor. 'Are
you with me?' he cried. 'Will you join me
in remembering the poor?* And this Pol
ish host grew eloquent." went on Mr.
Lloyd. "His guests grew enthusiastic.
Their hands were in their pockets and
they were ever ready to say, 'Yes, let's
send this meal so temptingly spread be
fore us to those less fortunate than we."
'Are you with me?' cald the host. 'We
are.' said the guests. 'Then,' cried the
generous Pole, "join with me in givlnp
three cheers for the poor.' "
commerce of the port is first rate, and bids fair to
rontinue so. Hence we may reasonably expect a
prosperous fall. .
The local situation stands about the same. Great
hopes have been built on active* markets resulting
from the Chinese trouble, but the feeble resistance of
the Chinese Government during the' past ten days has
1 dampening influence on these sanguine anticipations.
Hut whether we have a great Oriental war or not;
ihere will be plenty cf business during the coming
fall. The Government is continually buying more or
less goods in this market for the troops in the Philip
pines, the Northwest demand keeps up and the Alas
kan trade shows no signs of collapse thus far. The
Wheat continues the mule of the commercial pro
cession. Excepting the spurt some time ago, on ac
count of the partial failure of the crop in the North
west, it has been in the dumpsfor several years, its slug
gishness having been particularly marked last year,
uhen even-thing el?e was booming. The recent Gov
ernment report, indicating a crop of only 514,000,000
bushels, led the Secretary of Agriculture to predict
"dollar wheat" before the end of the year, but .Chi
cago apparently placed little faith in his judgment, for
the market not only did not advance but actually de
clined and has been weak ever since. Operators on
the Chicago Board of Trade are persistently predict
ing higher prices and advising people to buy, but the
market goes down all the' same. Wheat is apparently
a law unto itself. From time immemorial it has broken
everybody uho toyed with its seductive charms, and
bids fair to do so through the commercal "ages to
come. It never does what it is expected to do.
If there is any tendency it is toward a reaction from
the shrinkage in values and volume of business during
the first half of the year. This, occurring in a'Presi
dential election year, is highly encouraging, and is J
high compliment to the sound financial policy of the
nation. The tendency is usually the other way in
Presidential years. Thus the leading features last
week were continued expansion in fall-trade distribu
tion at leading Western centers, a better business in
dry goods in the East and renewed confidence, ac
companied by heavier buying, in some lines of iron
and steel. It may be. as some conservative authorities
insist, that we have touched bottom and are again on
the up grade, though no particular activity is expected
until after the election. The railroads, however, arc
reporting a steady increase in earnings, which is a
sure sign of an increased movement of merchandise.
Speculation, it is true, is at a low ebb, but this
is not an unfavorable indication by any means. The
money market continues characterized by ease and
abundance of funds, the only urgent demand at the
moment being in the West, where cash is needed to
move the crops. New York reports a larger number
of outside buyers in the city than for many years at
this seasonâ dry goods, groceries, jewelry and hard
ware being the lines most in demand. Judging from
ail these conditions the trade situation is distinctly
better than it was sixty days ago. If this improving
tendency continues we ought to roll up a good fall
trade, in spite of the forthcoming election.
TRADE POSSIBLY IMPROVING.
r~ I .." RADE throughout the country is running along
j with noteworthy steadiness. Apparently therr
* is neither increase nor <a:crease in the volume
of business. Week after week the bank clearings
show about the same relative proportion to those of
the corresponding weeks in 1899, and the same may
be said of the failures. Both have been comparatively
unfavorable ever since the turn of the year. The bank
clearings are showing a weekly loss of about 15 per
cent average, and the failures, while small and gener
ally unimportant, are slightly in excess of 1899. These
facts indicate that we have settled to a normal level
after two years of boom, and are progressing once
more on safe and normal lines.

Thus from all sides comes the warning. "Conditions
are so prosperous and every one is so contented." It
is upon that basis the bets are made of which our
Boston contemporary spoke. Now such confidence
as that forebodes disaster. The Democrats and the
Populists are united and the Silver Republicans and
the mugwumps of the Liberty. Congress are with
them. All the factions of discontent are working to
gether with a degree of unanimity they have never
shown before. Surely, it is time for Republicans to
rouse themselves from the pleasant dream of an easy
walkover. California Republicans, at any rate, can
afford to. take no chances. Each and all of them
should at once register and get ready to do a citizen's
full duty in the campaign. -
"Every one seems pretty well satisfied, so much 50
that if we do not look out we shall suffer from over
confidence. That is the danger this year."
A sliort time ago Secretary Hitchcock of the Re
publican National Committee, in discussing the re
ports received from the various States, said:
Republican managers do not profess to feel any
scare, as our Boston contemporary puts it, but they
are aware that even if McKinley be sure of election
there is no such assurance of Republican control of
the House of Representatives, nor of carrying Legis
latures in States where United States Senators are to
be elected. In some States the danger is imminent.
In California, for example, a comparatively slight fall
ing off of the Republican votejn several Congres
sional districts would result in the election of Demo
crats, and that in turn might result in giving the Dem
ocrats a majority in -the House of Representatives.
"When the-A>etting is 5 to 2 in favor of McKinley
on the Stock Exchange, it is difficult to make the
people believe that there is, in fact, any serious danger
of McKinley's defeat.- Whateverlscare the party man
agers may profess to feel, the 'people will not at pres
ent be much affected by it.? . ' â¢
Similar words of warning come to us from all parts
of the country. In some quarters the danger appears
even greater than here. Thus, for example, the Bos
ton Herald recently made light of the efforts of Re
publican leaders to arouse the people to a sense of
the danger, and said:
"Republicans should remember that this is a great
political year and it is particularly one in which there'
should be no chances taken. They should.be sure
that they are registered and they should go to the
polls and vote. That is all that is necessary to put
Mr. Bryan and his party on the same toboggan they
rede upon in the previous campaign. However, there
is the possibility of being overconfident. The battle
ground of this campaign is in the States of New -York,
Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. The people of the
United States, in the midst of the prosperity that now
blesses the country, do not want a change of adminis
tration; they do not want any 16 to i proposition with
the certainty that it will bring them disaster in a busi
ness way and paralyze industries generally.- There is
no excuse for making a change now; but the Demo
crats are thirsty for power and spoils and they will
put up a good fight, unless all signs fail. We of the
East depend upon the Pacific Coast to send us a solid
delegation, and it appears to me that they will deliver
the goods. On this occasion, however, every Repub
lican should vote, whether his vote is supposed to be
needed or not."
THE DANGER OF OVERCO FIDENCE.
SENATOR MASON, in an interview published
in The Call ; yesterday, has given Republicans
one more warning of the. danger of overconfi
dence in this election, and emphasized the duty of
every Republican to register and to vote, no matter
how sure he may be that hisparty will not be in need
of his particular services. We have seen from the slow
way in which Republicans are registering, in thiscity
how dangerous the overconfident feeling" is and how
far it clouds the otherwise bright prospects of Repub
lican victory. '. ', . - : * \ :

Reuben -Lloyd gave him a delightful din

Talking of Paris reminds me of a gos
sipy letter from Mr3. Paulsen. who is
now again in the gay capital after an
extended trip to nearly every point of in
terest on the Continent. Mrs. Paulsen
Â¦was quite ill in Dresden, but she is en
joying her usual good health now and haa
engaged passage for home early in Sep
tember.
September Is to be the great home-com
ing month and by the 18th day of the sec

French gowns and bonnets in town to

Miss Mamie Deane has Just gone on to

in company with the Misses de Young.
Mr. and Mrs. Will Crocker are among
the late arrivals at the exposition unlver

in three leaves.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Fayot. after having

QO home, little girl. There Is nothing
further that I can teach you."
That Is what the renowned Mme.
Deubillement-Chardon, lnstructrf"Â»
of miniature painting in Paris, tÂ»..l
talented Rose Hooper just about three
weeks ago. The good little girl packed
her trunks and came home to those who
loved her and, would you believe it. Mme:
Chardon's .unusual bidding with its re
markable qualifying clause would never
have been known here if it had not. been
for some French admirer who wrote it to
a gushing admirer in our own city. 'She,
as was plainly her duty, told the talc
Rose may be as reticent as she chooses
now. We know her glorious record.
You should have been present Â¦when Rose
unpacked those Paris trunks. Hats,
gowns, chiffons of all sortsâ why, it made
you think that there was nothing else
worth looking at in this worldâ until you
saw those miniatures. Such delicate work,
such coloring, suchâ but you have doubt
lessly by. this time seen them and must
agree with me in what, on account of my
lack of technical art praise terms, I do
not say. .'.
And whist! There are two miniatures
slgneW . "Hooper" in tue American build
ing of the Paris Exposition, and, further,
two have been accepted by the Royal
Academy in London.
But in spite of all her successes and ths
dearest, most fetching French accent in
all this world. Rose is sad. She has trou
bles of her own. She was not allowed to
bring her pet poodle, Gosse, home with
her. It is a. sad tale. And, like the popu
lar romances of to-day, mixes history and
sentiment.
In England, according to statistics and
things, they have almost stamped out
hydrophobia. To: keep up the record ho
one from foreign shores may carry a dog
into her Majesty's kingdom. Poor, ignor
ant little Rose had not read the scientinc
journals that explain these instructive
things and she bought her ticket for homo
via an English line. When she found she
could not carry Gos3e into the land of
chalky cliffs her distress was awful. First,
there was some talk of chloroforming the
poodle and. fooling the English officials.
But Rose's natural honesty, coupled with
the fear that Gosse might have a weak
heart, put that plan entirely out of the
question. So she came away without him
and left him in Paris in charge of a
friend. That friend will be home in about
three months. She sails on the French
line. We will- all have a chance around
Thanksgiving to admire Rose Hooper's
French poodle.

Nothing, to be sure, can excuse the treacherous at
tack upon the foreign legations with which the Celes
tials opened the fight. But such an attack is just what
might have been expectetd under the circumstances.
It is a cause for regret but not for surprise to those
who have watched the foreign jackals preying upon
the still animate body of China. Whatever, our sins
of omission or commission in the Philippines, our
hands, thank God, are clean as regards China. And
President McKinley is determined they shall remain
so.
In the recent war between China and Japan, the
latter undoubtedly had a just cause and won a well
deserved victory. The fruits of this victory Japan should
have been allowed to enjoy, but Russia, without a
shadow of right for interfering, insisted that Japan
should not be allowed to acquire territory on the
Asiatic mainland, compelled the Mikado to accept a
money compensation (the payment of which she guar
anteed) and proceeded to run the Trans-Siberian Rail
way through the Chinese province of Manchuria. Such
high-handed larceny shocked the moral sense of a
nation whose sovereign is, by the grace of God, offi
cially proclaimed to be Head of the Church of England
and Defender of the Christian faith: Lord Salisbury
reached out for more territory in Burmah and com
pelled China to allow free navigation of the Yangtse
kiang River. .. Then 'Â¦ Germany grabbed . Kiaochau, :
which in turn led Russia to appropriate Port Arthur,
which in turn compelled England, in self-defense, you
know, to seize Weihaiwei. Italy was about to join in
the game and establish a "sphere of influence" in Che-
Kiang, when the patience of the Chinese gave out and
theBoxer arose in the land.
After all this violence and bloodshed the wonder
is not that any foreigner's life was unsafe beyond the
range of a war vessel's guns, but that it should have
been safe even within that range. But Time the De
stroyer is also Time the Healer. Commerce brought
mutual benefits and things went along pretty well for
the next twenty years. In 1882 the French, in pur
suance of their new colonial policy, made a grab for
Tonkin which the English offset, not at France's ex
pense but at China's by seizing Upper Burmah.
The first aggressor of the century was England.
Her opium war of 1840 was one of the most iniquitous
the world has ever witnessed, for the Chinese Gov
ernment was honestly attempting to prohibit the.inv.
portation of this deadly drug when the English forced
it on them at the point of the tTayonet. The victors
wrested from the vanquished the port of Hongkong,
the right to trade at five other ports and a perpetual
license to poison the Chinese with opium. The Taip
ing rebellion gave England (this time allied with
France) another pretext to intervene in Chinese af
fairs. This led to the war of 1857-1860, in which Can
ton and the Pciho forts were captured and the Sum
mer Palace at Peking looted and destroyed. By the
: treat)' of Tientsin China was forced to pay a heavy
'indemnity, to open more ports, to cede more land
to the English near Hongkong, and finallyâ Oh,
crowning triumph of bullet and saber!â to repeal all
edicts against Christianity. "I came not to send
peace," said Christ, "but the sword." That saying
has never been explained away by the theologians,
but it has been literally fulfilled.
ALTHOUGH an orthodox follower of Confucius
it was gospel truth that Consul General Ho
Yow preached to the ladies of Oakland when
he informed them that the present^trouble in China is
due principally to two causes â first, the sacrilegious
action of Christian missionaries, whose proselytizing
ir China is an insult to a' religion that was old before
Christianity was dreamed* of; second, to the "en
croachments" of foreign nations upon Chinese terri
tory.
The Consul General, like all high officials of his
race, is a veritable Pink Portulacca of Perfect Polite
ness: that word "encroachments" shows also that he
possesses the power of discrimination characterizing
the skilled orator. Invited to lecture before ladies,
some of whom had sons engaged at that very moment
in pouring Krag-Jorgensen bullets into the Consul
General's countrymen â invited to lecture before such
an audience, it was not only tactful but also necessary
that he should refrain from stirring to mutiny the
hearts of his hearers by avoiding that harsh word
which is 3'our only true denomination for the actions
of the European powers that precipitated the war.
That word is ROBBERY.

In the end the fight for honesty can.be won only

Antics. .
Sylvain A. Lee, the hypnotist, opened
his week at the California Theater last
evening. He had a crowded house and a
crowded stags, for subjects were numer
ousâand susceptible. There were a score
or more who -braved the Invitation to
come forward and for two hours they cut
capers and played -pranks Â¦ at the word
of the operator until the audience was in
fits of laughter. It was not all humorous
work,- however.' One of the features was
when Lee's assistant was put to sleep and
made rigid and four heavy * men stood
upon his body, supported under the shoul
ders and heels by chalr3. Then Lee ran
a hatpin through each of the man's
cheeks and another through his righ. arm,
and with the pins. sticking through his
flesh the assistant went round through
the audience for every one to see. It
was done in illustration of the anesthetic
possibilities of hypnotism.
The Hindoo sleep was another feature
that was funny but also serious: The op
erator, seated himself crosslegged upon a
rug and the audience was invited to look
into his eyes, each one at the same time
thinking how sleepy .ic or she was. Soon
one then another and then more swayed
in their seats and ; finally there wero
twelve or fifteen sleeping , peacefully. Lee
then went round and woke them up with
a touch and a snap of the finger, or In
the case of those in the galleries by
stretching his hand toward them, speak
ing quickly and snapping his fingers. ;
Tho performance wound up with a sug

ONE of the most attractive floats to
be In line on the day of the parade
will be the one that Is being pre
pared for the French colony. It Is
to be emblematic of California. The State
will be represented by a young lady and
the float will in other designs be compli
mentary to the United States and France.
The decorations will be In the French
style of coloring and of grouping of small
flags. It will be a credit to the day. the
procession and the residents who contrib
uted the funds to prepare It.
The several organizations that are to
represent the fire departments of Califor
nia, volunteer and paid, have completed
all arrangements for the parade. The
Exempts, whose headquarters are on
Brenham place, will turn out about sixty
men in ahe uniform of the Baltimore fire
men and will haul after them the first
engine used in the volunteer fire depart
ment to be followed bv the double-decker
or that department. "Bi* Six," drawn by
horses, the old veterans no longer hav
ing the physical ability to man the ropes
as in the days of their prime. This will in
all probabilitv be the last public demon
stration in which these old heroes of the
great fires of San Francisco will ever
parade. They will be followed by those
who are to succeed them, the prospective
heirs of the treasures of volunteer days
and the records of the old department.
These are young men who have organized
themselves into an association known as
the Sons of Exempts. They will be at
tired in black trousers, red shirts, blue
caps and belts, with the name of the as
sociation printed upon it. They will haul
one of the old-time hose reels. The vet
erans of the paid Fire Department will
close the rear of this division. This or
ganization is made up of these members
of the paid department who served twenty
years or more.
Another division will be made up of the
Veteran Volunteer Firemen's Associa
tion, which has headquarters at 24 Fourth
street, and which is composed of men
who served in any volunteer fire depart
ment in the State of California. The
members, preceded by their own band,
will be out In black trousers, the tradi
tional red shirt, black ties and black hel
mets. They will have in line their old
engine "Volunteer" and possibly the ma
hogany piano box engine which was pro
cured for Knickerbocker Engine Company
No. 5 in December, 1&52, at a cost of $3250.
AVith this division will be placed the en
gine companies that are to come from
Fresno, Petaluma, Berkeley and other
sections.
The paid Fire Department will be rep
resented by a detail of men from differ
ent companies, and they will have under
their charge a steam engine, hose wagon,
battery, water tower, hook and ladder
truck and a chemical engine.
The Governor has been asked to review
the parade. An answer has been received
to the effect that he will gladly do so If
he returns to the State In time. In case
he does not that duty will devolve upon
the acting Governor, Jacob H. Neff.
As to what extent the United States
army will be represented in the parade
will depend in a great measure upon the
COVELO. CaL. Aug. 19.â George
"Whitney, one of the members of the Co
velo poesÂ©, errived here this afternoon
fresh from the camp and ecene of the
main expedition of man-hunters who are
scouring: tiio rugged mountain passes for
J. B. King, the slayer of S. H. Church.
Whitney arrived nvlth a pack horse for
provisions and supplies and will return
to-morrow to Join tnÂ« scouting 1 party. He
etated that four members of the posse
6TÂ« guarding the mountains passes over
Anthony Peak, while others are skirmish
ing la th.Â© Trinity Hills for some clew
that win lead toÂ«a fresh traiL Wednes
<lay and Thursday last, Whitney says, all
thÂ© members of thÂ© possÂ© pushed forward
toward "WeavervillÂ©. expecting to meet
Sheriff* Taylor and Bergin, but not being
able to grain any Information as to their
movements returned to cover the An
thony Peak passes, believing Sheriff Tay
lor Â¦â¢Â»â¢"<? posse were pursuing a good, clew
In that direction.
Whitney declares he expected both mall
and telegraphic advices from Taylor ot
Bergin here to-day, but notning was re
ceived, and It is doubtful if the posse will
proceed further north without Instructions
from Taylor concerning future plans.
"Whitney declares the amount of terri
tory covered by the various posses in the
last three weeks will approximate a thou
eand miles through shrubbery on the
foothills, and it is doubtful if it has ever
been excelled as a man-hunt In the annals
of crime. No one can have a Just appre
ciation of Its magnitude and what hard
ships the posse are called upon to under
ro and endure until he has traveled over
the Chemessal Mountains, going through
brush and places where even a bear
Â¦would 6carorly attempt to force his way.

ANTHONY PEAK
BEING GUARDED
BY THE POSSE
The fact that Domingos, the brother,
was very aeitated and excited when he
left his wife at Mrs. Amelia Suiza's house
on Thursday, June 21, and the further
fact that his wife said to Mrs. Suiza that
"something terrible has happened on the
island" after he had left the Suiza place
was sufficient in the minds of the officers
to justify them in taking Domingos and
his wife into custody.
The Portuguese residents along the river
approve of the wholesale arrests and be
lieve that if the proper course is pursued
it 'will be conclusively shown that Mary
Vierra did not commit suicide, but that
she had been murdered.
The Portuguese people living in the vi
cinity of Isleton insist that everything
points to Antone Vierra having choked
nis wife to death and thrown her body
into the river. Antone and his wife had
had freq\ient quarrels, and the finding of
her body in the river, together with other
suspicious circumstances, were sufficient
to move the other members of the colony
to demand an investigation after the in
quest had been held.
Antone's mother, who is a very old wo
man and who cannot speak the English
language in the name of the Savior
swears that she knows not how her
daughter-in-law came by her death. The
others are equally insistent that they do
not know in what manner Mary died.
A Chinaman named Lee Ong Gee testi
fied at the Coroner's inquest that he last
saw the deceased alive, on the evening of
Friday, June 22â at least, he was so un
derstood to say. Since then he has said
that it was on the day before when he
had last seen Mrs. Vierra. He says that
he was probably misunderstood. Dr. W.
S. Makenson, who assisted in the post
mortem examination, says that the body
could not have been in the condition in
which it was found if it had been in the
water only since Friday. The body was
found the following Monday. The upper
portion of the body was badly swollen and
discolored and the muscles of the throat
were pressed together, and their condition
generally, the officers say, indicated that
the woman had been strangled.
Another suspicious circumstance tend
ing to show that the husband intended
leaving the country, the officers contend,
was the incident of his mother giving him
$40 on their journey to this city in W. E.
Elliott's launch on Friday mornine. An
tone Vierra is looked upon by his country
men as the real murderer of his wife.
They contend that his mother knows more
about the case than she cares to tell the
officers. - â¢
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 19.â The desires of
the Portugnese colony for a full and
searching inquiry regarding the death of
Mrs. Mary Vierra, whcse dead body was
found in the Sacramento River at Ida
Island, below Isleton, this county, on the
25th of last June, will be fulfilled. To that
end the dead woman's husband, Antone
Vierra; his mother, Joaquln Vierra; his
brother, Domingos Vierra, and the lat
ter's wife, a girl about 16 years of age,
were arrested at Rio Vista, Solaoo Coun
ty, this morning by Constable Cottrell
of Isleton upon complaints sworn out by
Manuel F. Vincent, a Portuguese farmer
residing in the lower part of the county.
They were brought to the County Jail
here to-night by District Attorney Baker,
County Detective Golden and Constable
Cottrell and were duly separated so as
to prevent intercommunication between
themselves.

Dispute of Passenger
and Conductor Will
End in Court.
RINGS FARES AS
A SWEET REVENGE
JOSEPH VAN MOHR, a clerk,
took a novel means of vent
ing his spite on a street car
conductor whom he thought
wae robbing him Saturday night,
and his overweening desire for re
venge landed him behind prison
bars at the California-street police
Ptation, charged with malicious mis
chief.
Van Mohr boarded a Kearny
street car near the corner of Sac
ramento Btreet, and before Wash
ington street was reached had a
dispute with the conductor. J. F.
Hillard. The passenger claims he
paid the conductor 10 cents, but
when he held out his hand for the
change the railroad company's
agent had a laraway look In his
eye and went on about his work re
gardless of the outstretched palm.
Then he poked the man with the
br&RS buttons In the ribs and made
a demand for 5 cents.
"What 5 cents?' asked the con
ductor, aghast. "This company
does not refund fares. Once.lt gets
Its flr.scrs en a piece of money it
holds on to It."
Van Mohr ptill Insisted that: he
had handed over 10 cents, and the
conductor was equally confident
that he had received : only half of
that amount.
"Well, I'll copper that nickel all
right," said Van Mohr, purple with
rage. "At any rate you will "have
to turn It in to the company." <--
The enraged passenger grabbed
the cord attached to the register
and rung up several fares. He then
jumped from the car. but at the in
stance "of the conductor was arrest
ed by Officers David. Murphy; and
Thomas W. Handley on' r Montgom
ery street. His case will come up In
the Police Court to-day.

OAKLAND.
Knell was so easy to find on the Oak
land grounds yesterday morning that but
seven Innings of ball could be played. It
Â¦was not the commission of errors that
lost Frisco the game, but the stalwart
stickwork of the Oakland players.
Borchers did the box act for Oakland
and his performance, although not strong
in the beginning, ended well. The fourth
was his worst inning, when three runs
on as many hits gave the local men the
only encouragement afforded by the game.
The feature of the game was the home
run of Krug, who swatted the ball to the
far-away center field fence. Sullivan was
on a sack at the time..
The game was a mere preparation for
uncle Henry's dose of misery to come.
The score:
Oakland 9, San Francisco 5.

SAN FRANCISCO,
But this was not all. In the very next
Inning the mild-mannered Dudes rubbed
the acid Into the flesh by scoring three
more runs. Then came the ninth, when
the pulse of the crowd raised some few
degrees. Pabst. who separated the ball
from the grounds In the first Inning, had
a life's chance. He struck out, and now
the little dog carries his tall beneath
him. The score:
Think of it! Eight runsâ by Dudes, at
thatâ In a single Inning. Seven times
they shot rockets and ground works with
in the fence lnclosure. Fourteen tlmea
at bat, the Dudes became legsore from
coursing the sacks. Uncle Henry dropped
heavy beads of cold sweat that- symbol
ized a book of ireful emotions. Every
Brummel in the crowd seemed to find the
ball and soak it to the fence. Rube Levy
tried a one-hand stunt, but the ball was
free from glue. Brockhoff had his hands
on a low drive, but failed to hold. To
have was not to hold with Frisco yester
day. Josh Reilly juggled, lost control of
his top-piece and gave the scorer work on
the last column. All was wrong and the
tide of black sorrow swept over Hank to
submersion.
Whoever said that- there were nine In
nings to a baseball game knew whereof
he spoke. Until the seventh at Recreation
grounds yesterday afternoon the Dudes
were in but not of the game. Iburg was
touched but twice and the fancy dressers
from the noisy town couldn't make a
round trip to save their hides. But this Is
where Iburg fell, and many a local youth
will have to look for another diamond
Idol on whom to bestow his admiration,
adoration and adulation.
Pabst, who found the grounds too small
for his stick efforts early in the game,
lost his eye and failed to strike at two
good ones. The third he struck at, but
swatted only the Inoffensive air. Then
the local side of the bleachers said some
thing not nice and the Athenians swelled
with pride fend Joy. The game was over
and it belonged to the Dudes.
The rooters were frantic. It was Fris
co's last chance with the stick and Mos
klman had weakened. When they took
stands on the bags and the "Brewer"
came to the plate every boy, woman and
gray-whiskered fanatic in the crowd stood
up and yelled their throats dry.
Three yellow-capped pretzel-eaters
crowded the sacks, yet Pabst struck out.
Not a man had perished and the score
was five against the Frisco team.
Oakland 11, San Francisco 7.
Special Diwateh to The CalL
NAPA Aug. 19.â About twenty-five
members of the Bay City Wheelmen of
San Francisco arrived in Napa this morn
ing at 11 o'clock, having made the run
to this city from Vallejo over the new
cycle path that was recently constructed
between Vallejo and Napa by two clubs
representing those towns.
A committee from the Eagle Cycling
Club of this city met the Bay City boys
at Napa Junction and escorted them to
Naya. Here they were Joined by other
members of the Eagles and the run was
continued to Napa Soda Springs, seven
miles distant from here, where a lunch
eon wae partaken of and several hours
spent in enjoying the sights and pleasures
that are afforded guests at that resort.
Tne visiting wheelmen made short stops
at Napa berth in going and coming from
the si'rings. They expressed themselves
as well pleased with the new cycle path
and enjoyed their ride over it very much.
It is claimed that as soon as the track
packs hard and more cinders are put on
it will be very easy to make fast time be
tween Napa and Vallejo by wheel. It is
intended next spring to place more cinders
on the Nana end of the path.
The Eagle Cycling club of Napa is much
gratified with the expressions of satis
faction made by the Bay city cyclers
relative to the condition of the track, be
cause the EaclÂ«-s were Instrumental in
raising the money expended on it from
tho citizens of Napa.
The Bay City bovs are the first to make
a Hub run over the new path, and their
opinion as to its condition and usefulness
will have grrat wricnt as to its future.
Bay City Wheelmen Enjoy
the Run From Vallejo
to Napa City.

things which are a source of much anxiety
and refrret to a larjre circle of your admlreri
and adherents in this city. AH indications
point to the fact that you are posing as the
head and front of the Ciimmizis-Kelly faction
on the "Fire BUI." Now you know what thlÂ»
means. It fills your friends la this city with
mortification and surprise to see you in such
an attitude. For years we have been labor
ing to overthrow Buckleyism and put down
just such methods as that bill La designed to
build up. Rowdy rule In San Francisco
reached such excesses that the better element*
from both parties got together last November
and buried it out of slffht. The promises of the
Republican party, and Just such men as your
self, went far toward effecting this result.
We said, as Republicans, to the ontrased
people: "Give us a chance to run the city
and State once more and see what wÂ« will do
for reform and decency and honesty." The
r coi>le took us at our word and trusted us.
What Is the result? It is not mor* than two
months since the new order of thlnjrs berun
and there are already indications of a concerted
and far-reachin* scheme to restore Buckley's
methods and sink the State and municipal gov
ernment into a worse condition of debauchery
than everâ If such were possible.
In this city the ring Is alreafl* formM In
thÂ« School Board and in the Board of Super
visors. Employes are paying; a percentage of
their salaries to the bosses at the City Kail -
and Jobbery is in the air. In Sacramento thw
conditions ire even worse. The Lrglslaturo
is not redeeming Its promises to the people. .
Bills are hanging fire which should go
through with a bound, and ugly, snaky leg
islation is cropping out In dark place*, ret
ting its inspiration from, the hands of unscru
pulous manipulators. The people are Justified
in suspecting that there is "boodle" In Sac-
r smfnto And svispic! 011 will hftvo Â«'Tin nc** 1 * to
conviction unless some healthy, honest meas
ures are soon taken up and passed.
Now. Judge, you cannot afford to stand In
with these pirates. Associations with Crim
mins and Kelly mean political death to you
and the forfeiture of the good opinions of your
thousands of friends throughout this district
It means more: The Republican party Is on
its last legs in this State if men like you fatl
to live up to Us high promises and permit Its
councils to be debauched by Jobbers ami cor
ruptionists who have entered Into secret league
with Sam Rainey and the devil. The renta
ble element in the Republican party experts
you to continue to train with It In opposition
to barroom politics and polluting boss meth
ods. If you fail to do this you will ro down
as ceitainly as went down from hts asso
ciation with Buckley, and you deserve it.
â¢ â¢ â¢
You must pardon my vehemence in this mat
ter, but I mean it; and If I did not frankly
unbosom myself to you I would not certainly
be the friend which I profess to be. Very sin
cerely yours. SAMUEL W. BACKUS.
The political camp followers who never
come out openly and take part in affairs
until events foreshadow the winning ele
ment are leaving Kelly and Crlmmlnsi.
During the past twenty- four hours Alfred
Bouvier chairman of the Republican
County 'Committee; James A. Wilson
secretary and A. Ruef. who introduced
the proposition to create a special com
mittee of eighteen to guard against fraud.
have received many assurances of politi
cal svmpathv from those who have hith
erto been non-committal, pe fact is well
known to the rounders that Kelly and
Crimmins. Who expected to capture thÂ«
works are on the losing end. Kelly can
be defeated In his own stronghold, the
Twentieth District. If the straight Repub
licans of that district will simply put a
Bood ticket in the field and participate In
the election. The boss programme to send
rounders from the Twenty-eighth and
Twenty-ninth to the Forty-first District
to help Dibble out of his trouble will have
no force, an the returning board has given
notice that fraudulent returns will be
thrown out. '
â¢ <.
Republicans throughout the city art
preparing for the primary election which
will take place next Friday. August 24.
According to the provisions of the call
adopted by the Republican County Com
mittee there shall be two polling places
in each Assembly district. The polls will
be kept open continuously between tho
hours of 7 a. m. and 6 p. m. It is pro
vided in the official call that all tickets to
be voted lor at said primary election shall
be filed with the committee on or before
12 o'clock noon. Wednesday, August 22.
1900. and all votes cast at said primary
election for persons other than persons
whose names appear upon one or more or
such tickets shall bÂ« counted as scatter
ing.
Kepubllcan citizens who desire that good
and true men shall be sent to the State
and local nominating conventions should
confer with the county committeemen In
their respective districts to the end that
the tickets may be completed -within the
time prescribed.
Harmony Committee Meets.
The committee appointed to promote
harmony in several districts where strife
is threatened met yesterday afternoon and
the members exchanged views. The com
mittee consists of T. H. McCarthy. A.
Kuef, I. J. Truman Jr., J. F. McGlynn
and William Metzner. In several of the
districts conflicting interests have been
reconciled. The declaration openly made
by the special committee of eighteeen,
which was recently appointed by Chair
man Bouvier. gives assurance to worlt
ingznen, merchants, business men and tax
payers generally that the votes fairly cast
at the primary will be honestly counted.
The assertion that fraudulent impersona
tion, repeating and stuffing will not be
tolerated will encourage good citizens to
go to the polls and participate In the
election.
Bosses Are Disgusted.
Martin Kelly and Phil Crimmins are dis
gusted with the edict that ballot box stuf
ting shall not be tolerated. Kelly's idea
or a ballot box is something that was
made to be stuffed. Yesterday he was
sending out his henchmen from the Mint
saloon to persuade weak and timid county
committeemen to attend a caucus of bolt
ers to-morrow night. The official call of
the Republican State Central Committee
has been contemptuously cast into tho
cewer by Crimmins and Kelly. They have
ordered a Fourth Congressional JDistrict
primary with a view of creating a con
vention to nominate Senators and Assem
blymen. Kelly is calling to his assistance
all those who Joined him in kniflng Hor
ace Davis and supporting Phelan at tnÂ»
last municipal election.
Will Not Take Orders.
Several county commlt*eemen who
voted against the adoption of the official
call have announced that they will not
take orders from Kelly and Crimmins, but
on the contrary will sustain the chairman
of the committee and his advisers in ef
forts to secure a fair and square primary.
It is worth noting that most or the re
cent trouble in the Republican County
Committee was caused by Dibble, who
was not willing that the county commit
teemen of the Forty-first should appoint
the election officers of that district. Dib
ble wants to be returned to the Legisla
ture, and stands ready to sacrifice every
thing 1 else to gratify his own ambition.
Scathing Letter to Dibble.
The following letter from General S. W.
Backus to Judge Dibble, written in 1>91.
will indicate about the time that the latter
elected to cast his political fortunes with
Crimmins and Kelly. The letter ought
to be carefully read by every voter In the
Forty-first District:

The second race of this season of the
San Francisco Yacht Club from Vallejo
to Sausalito took place yesterday. The
yachts were divided into two classes, the
small class including the cutter Folly and
the smaller sloops enrolled in the club,
and the large class including the schoon
ers and big sloops. As I. Gutte's schooner
Chispa was the only one of the big boats
that went up to Vallejo on Saturday
night, there was no race in the large
class; but the small boats had an ex
citing and interesting- contest. The start
was across an Imaginary line drawn from
the gangway ol the receiving ship Inde
pendence to the Vallejo shore, and,
though the official starting time was
10:15 a. m., by mutual agreement among
tne owners a start was made at 9:30, time
being taken by Commodore W. J. Woods
of the Vallejo Yacht Club. The sloop
cygnus, sailed by ex-Commodore T. to.
Hill, who has just returned from Europe,
crossed the line first, followed by the
cutter Folly, sailed by George D. Camp
bell; the sloop Siren, sailed by J. M. Pun
nett; the sloop Thetis sailed by R. S
Brldgeman; the sloop Catherine, sailed
by Archie Sutherland, and the sloop Sur
prise.
After leaving Mare Island Straits the
cutter Folly went to the front and looked
like a winner, but her skipper. Instead of
going over to the Marln shore, kept to
the Contra Costa side and was gradually
overhauled and oapsed by all except the
Catherine and Surprise, which were dis
tanced. There was a nice sailing breeze
and smooth water until about half way
across San Pablo Bay, but from there on
the neas were heavy and the breeze very
stiff and in spots exceedingly puffy. On
coming out cf Mare Island Straits the
ploop Siren ran into the sloop Thetis, but
neither sustained any serious damage.
R. S. Bridgeman s Thetis made an ex
cellent trip, beating the fleet by nearly
an hour, actual railing time. Siren fin
ished only IS seconds ahead of Cygnus.
but heat her by 2 minutes 27 seconds cor
rected time. The length of the course is
; estimated at twenty-six nautical miles
and the race was begun on the ebb tide, :
but finished against a strong flood. L.
Q. Haven was Judge and R. B. Hogue
timer. The full details are given in the

So far as speed figured. Geary's fast
Palo Alto certainly far outclassed any
greyhound on the card In the finals of the
big open stake at Union Coursing Park
yesterday, but hesitating and laying off
the came, a fatal habit with him, cost
him the flag in the deciding course with
Whiteheud. Coursing throughout the day
was of the hign ciass and it is doubtful
if a better programme was ever run olf
in this State.
Tha running of Palo Alto was the day's
feature, and the way he showed the route
to the fastest of them was a treat. He
gave an idea of what* speed he possesses
when he beat Rocker in the third round.
He opened up a gap that would cause the
distance flag to ue dropped in a trotting
match, and made Rocker look like a ship
at anchor, and at that JDeckelman's dog
can move along these days.
In the final Whitenead figured on the
short end at 4 to 1, and this, even consid
ering his last work, seemed a fair price.
Palo Alto; after showing the speed, played
the waiting game and allowed Lopez's dog
to score until the hare reached the escape.
The red flag showed that Palo Alto had
paid the penalty.
Sylvanus made a good showing, and by
his fast work reached the fifth round. The
speed is in him, but he lacks gameness
and is not overfond of work. The talent
sized him up right in his go with Olita in
the fifth. He had just beaten Royal
Flush, a 4 to 1 favorite, and was on the
long end in this course. The dogs ran an
undecided, after which the talent, know
ing his weak spot, reversed the odds and
made Olita favorite. It was a wise move
âSylvanus was beaten pointless.
Flora McDonald showed well and
reached the fifth round,, where she went
out to the runner-up in a short go. St.
Helen got the same treatment in tne next
round. She did well in the stake.
Whitehead was in good condition and
showed himself capable of classing- with
the top notchers.. The day's results, with
Judge John Grace's official scores, follow:

FUNERAL OF LATE
~;v GENERAL HEUSTON
XVIII.
Reconstruction Views of Lincoln and
Johnson.
President Lincoln set forth In his first
Inaugural his belief that the Union could
not be broken by any so-called ordinance
of secession In one or many States. The
illegal and rebellious acts were regarded
as those of assemblages of Individuals,
and not of the corporate States as such.
This was the view commonly adopted in
the North at the time. But to Lincoln's
practical mind it seemed, when concrete
questions of restoration were to be defi
nitely decided, that this theoretic position
respecting the status of the disloyal
States 'was "a merely pernicious abstrac
tion," which he "purposely refrained
from discussing." Still the steps which

It is stated that Andrew Jackson held
similar views as to the indestructibility
of the Union, but he reached his conclu

The President's power of removal from
office was made subject to the approval

Congress was determined to carry
through its own policy of reconstruction

was that between the executive and tho

Republicans stood by the President,

of the States re-established and the di
visive subject of slavery on the point of
permanent elimination from national
questions. Nor were they prepared to re

should permit the States whose power*
had been so long In abeyance to resume
their places In the national Legislature,
"and thereby complete the work of res

satisfied with the acts of the new Souta
ern Legislatures but with certain proc
lamations of the President also, which
gave to delegate conventions or Legisla
tures In the reorganized States power to
prescribe the qualifications of electors
and office holders. This was contradictory
to a doctrine held by the most radical
members of the Republican partyâ thae
the enfranchisement of the negroes fol
lowed necessarily upon emancipation. As
suming that by secession a State de
stroyed, all Its constitutional rights as a
member of the Union they declared the
whole matter of the civil and political
rights of the inhabitants of the rebel
lious States to be in the hands of the Fed
eral Government and that the Govern
ment was bound to guarantee to the freed
men equal rights with the whites. Tho
seceding States, having destroyed their
statehood by their own acts, were no
longer States, but Territories, to be read
mitted Into the Union upon such terms as
Congress might choose to impose. Upon
these Issues the legislative and executive
departments of the Government Joined
battle. The President was irascible and
violent. Congress was suspicious and un
yielding and the breach was continually
widened.

REORGANIZATION AFTER THE WAR.
Young CalifornJan Drowned in 'Midocean After
Having Been Twice Â¦'â¢Shanghaied"
fi=3R0M out the sea world of tne mariners has come a man. buffeted by
p^ the squalls of many climes, who presents to sorrowing relatives the
I! solution of the mystery surrounding the disappearance nearly two
years ago of deorge E. Fisher, a youth formerly well known in San
Francisco. The lad, who longed to become a soldier, died a sailor after be
ing twice shanghaied, and his bones rest forever at the bottom of the ocean
off the South American coast.
George E. Fisher was the nephew and adopted son of George Fisher of
Niles and nephew of Charles Fisher of the well-known liquor house of Ros
coni & Fisher of this city. When the war with Spain broke out he wanted
to enlist In the National Guard, but was refused -because of physical disa-
blllty. In November, 1S98, he disappeared from home and was not heard 7
from again until he wrote to his adopted father from the Mariners' Home in
Liverpool saying he had been shanghaied at Astoria by a man named Lar
ry Sullivan and was then trying to get a berth on a ship bound for. Mobile."
From that day nothing was heard of the lad until yesterday, when a man
named Max Lentz. now at the Sailors' Home, told the rest of the story.
"I was In Mobile about the beginning of the year," said Lentz. "How it
happened I don't know, but one morning I found myself aboard the British
wooden bark Stadacona and bound for Buenos Ayres. In the same predica
ment as myself was a lad named George Fisher. He told me he was from
California and was on his way home when the "crimps" caught him.
"All we could do was to make me best of the matter, but Captain D. M. ,
Cogswell (the sailor only gives the surname, the Initials being taken from
Lloyds' register) proved to be a tyrant and we had a terrible time. We left
Mobile on February 10, 1900, and on March 27 we were within about a month's
sail of port. The captain wanted the old wooden box painted up and he or
dered a Staging rigged over the Side. The rope used was the oldest on the
bark and some of it had been spliced and spliced* again. Captain Cogswell
seemed to have taken a dislike to young Fisher and everv chance he got
ordered him over the side. Fisher was hard at work- painting when the
working of the ship caused the spliced rope to part and the young man
disappeared. When the Stadacona was hove to there was no trace of the boy.
"The Stadacona reached Buenos Ayres on April 30 and the' first chance
we got I and two others left her. When the American ship "Edward Sewall
put In with her cargo heated we got on her and came to \ San Francisco.
I think, and so did everybody aboard the Stadacona, that .Captain Cogswell
was morally responsible for the death of George Fisher. The Stadacona
was not properly found, for had she been that rope would 'not have parted
and the young man would not have been drowned." .
In a memorandum book kept by young Fisher and brought to California
by Lentz the young man notes under the head of "Mariners' Home, Liver
pool," that he wrote to papa and Uncle Charley." The next entry shows
him in Mobile and very friendly with a man named "Jack Holmes." The
last entry is "Latitude 11, N longitude, 25 East." This must have been about
the position in which the Stadacona was when young Fisher was lost
overboard.
The Stadacona left Buenos Ayres for Santos on June 26 and from there
will probably go to Europe with nitre. She Is a Nova See Jan bark, owned

RABBI MYERS TALKS ?0N
"THE JEW AND THE BOXER"
Draws Parallel Between Movement in
China and Persecution of
Hebrews.
Rev. Isadore Myers delivered an Inter
esting discourse at Ohabai Shalome Tem
ple last night on the subject, "The Jews
and the Boxers."- He drew a parallel be
tween the movement of the Boxers
against the Christians In China and the
persecutions to which. the Jewish race has
been subjected for many centuries. He
ascribed ' the cause of the massacres by
the Boxers to the interference of foreign
ers with their cherished ideals.
"The term Boxer is synonymous with
extreme fanaticism and intolerance," said
Dr. Myers. "The Boxer spirit Is an old
institution and goes back to the time of
Nimrod. who persecuted Abraham; to
Pharaoh and Hainan, who slew the Israel
ites.. The history of the Jews for the last
1700 years has been one unvarying expe
rience of Boxerism. The police of the
world have driven the Jews from corner
to corner, to be burned, to be driven into
the sea and expelled at a moment's no
tice. The Jews have ever been the vic
tims of intolerance and fanaticism. It is
that spirit which compels people to change
their religion under pain of death or os
tracism. Let us be thankful that the spirit
of Boxerism is dead in the two Anglo-
Saxon nationsâ America and Great Brit
ain. It is fortunate that the laws in these
two countries are made for all men alike
but let us not be too sure that the times
will not cause a change, for It is difficult
to kill the spirit of fanaticism."

'Goldfish are easily kept alive and heal

haust themselves and die. sometimes after
a couple of days. Square aquariums are
best, and the vessel must t>e properly
filled with gravel and aquatic plants, the
more plants the better.
"Furthermore, the fish should never be
kept' in running water, and the water
should never be changed more than twice
a year, provided, of course, the aquarium
la properly constructed and has the neces
sary amount of gravel, aquatic plants and
the like. If this be the case, the carbonic
acid pas exhaled by the fish Is inhaled by
the plants in the water, and the oxygen
given out by the nlants Is breathed by thÂ«
fish, thus producing an equalization that
keeps the aquarium In a healthy condi

was nominated for President. The Demo

tio Seymour of New York was the can
didate. Grant received 214 electoral
votes. Seymour 80. but several of tlie
Southern States had not been readmitted
and were not allowed to vote. Tha di
vision between the parties was drawn by
the question of reconstruction alone. Pro

the result of the election would seem to
settle the rule that any State which for

RARE TALENT OF
A LITTLE DANCER
Mrs. Inez Castro Schmidt Makes a
Sensational Attack on Her
Husband's Companion. Â»
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway. Aug. 19.â
A dark shadow in the form of a woman
has come between Inez Castro Schmidt
and young Harry Schmidt, her husband,
whose^name graces the City Prison reg
ister with a charge of battery against it.
A happy home has been broken up, and a
young wife's pitiful Etory of hardship,
abuse and neglect Is the culmination of
what she declares is her spouse's infatua
tion for another woman.
The troubles led to a street Bcene late
last night at West Oakland, when Mrs.
Schmidt and her mother-in-law discovered
young Schmidt and his inamorata stroll
ing arm-in-arm along Seventh street. The
wife made at once for the woman, while
a great crowd collected to witness the
hair-pulling match. Angered beyond con
trol, Mrs. Schmidt tried to reach the cause
of her troubles, but the husband managed
to keep the furious woman off, while he
skillfully piloted the other out of harm's
way.
The mother and the wife returned to the
residence of the elder Schmidts, at Sev
enth and Campbell streets, being followed
later by Schmidt. There was another
quarrel, and then cries of "Police!" dis
turbed the air. A patrolman hastened to
the house, and upon complaint of Mrs.
Schmidt arrested her husband, who, she
charged, had brutally choked her because
she had remonstrated with him about his
conduct. â¢ ,
Schmidt was formerly a confectioner in
this city. His wife is a daughter of the
house of Castro, one of the earliest of the
Spanish families. Their home was formerly
on the San Pablo rancho and the head of
the house counted his wealth by hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
Until lately the Schmidts had been re
siding at 658 Twenty-first street, near
West. But the domestic difficulties caused
the breaking up of the home, and Mrs.
Schmidt with her three young children
sought refuge with her husband's pare/its.
Schmidt is out of Jail under bail. His
case will be heard to-morrow in the Police
Court. The woman in the case Is known
as Mrs. Kane.

WHO BROKE UP HER HOME
ANDREW JOHNSON.
long strict construction Democrat, he
mtiintalned that the corporate relations
of the States to the central Government
had not been interrupted by the war and
remained Intact when hostilities ceased:
that the United States had no authority
to coerce a State; since the rebellious con
duct of individuals had deprived the peo
ple of certain States of all civil govern
ment, it had become necessary to enforce
the obligations of the United States to
the people of those States "in securing
them In the enjoyment of a republican
form of government."
"When Johnson assumed the reins of
government he was eager to hasten on
the work of reconstruction which Lin
coln had begun. As Congress would not
meet until December, the executive had
' for eight months a free hand. By mid
summer he had appointed provisional
Governors in all the remaining States of
the disturbed section, defining their du
ties and powers much as Lincoln had de
; fined those of -Johnson himself on ap
j pointing him Military Governor of Ten
nessee, and before Congress assembled
In December State governments had been
erected under â¢ the President's proclama
tion and Senators and Representatives
from all the States lately in rebellion, ex
cept Texas and Florida, were ready to
demand seats In the National Legisla
ture. The political powers and privileges
in the several States were confined to
those who should take the oath of am
nesty but the number of loyal citizens
was swelled by the granting of special
pardons to many who were excluded from
a share in the restoration offered by the
general amnesty. The conditions imposed
by the President for the recognition of
the new State governments were ratifica
tion by the first State Leglslautre of the
thirteenth amendment, which made slav
ery forever illegal in the United States,
nullification of the secession ordinances
and repudiation of the war debt.
Status of Slavery and the Freedmen.
The emancipation proclamation of 1S63
was a purely military act. It destroyed
slavery only within the districts controlled
by the army, and did not affect it in the
loval States. Only as commander of the
military forces of the nation had the Pres
ident any power over the Institutions of
the States, and that power waa strictly
limited to the regions where the army
was actually In possession. Some of the
slave States not affected by the procla
mation soon commenced a legal process
of emancipation, but not until the adop
tion of the thirteenth amendment was any
legal standing given to the freedmen. Con
eress submitted the amendment In Febru
ary 1S65 for the action of the States, and
by December of the same year It had re
ceived ratification by twenty-seven States,
eleven being slave States and eight of
them those recently in rebellion.
Now at last slavery was dead, but In
dving it bequeathed a sinister legacy to
divide and embroil the estranged sections
and to delay the restoration of brotherly
relationsâ which is. indeed, hardly yet
complete A helpless horde of contrabands
and freedmen began early In the war to
embarrass the army and to gather along
the Confederate border. Private charity
under military protection did much to re
lieve their rcore pressing needs, and
Northern philanthropy at once entered
upon the task of educating and civilizing
them; but It was felt that they had a
rightful claim upon the Government which
had given . them freedom for some per
manent provision for their future. By the
establishment, in March, 1865, of the freed
man's bureau under the War Department
the Federal Government recognized Its re
sponsibility toward the dependent blacks.
The bureau was given control of all mat
ters relating 1 to refugees and freedmen
and abandoned lands from or within the
territory held by. the army. The act was
to remain In force for only one year from
the close of tho war. As based solely
upon the war powers of the Government,
It would necessarily expire with the return
of peace. So vague were the terms of the
bill that, while It availed to relieve the
immediate destitution of the negroes and
to inaugurate some measures for settling
them upon abandoned or confiscated lands
in the South, it did nothing toward estab
lishing: their rights before the law or de
termining their political standing.
The Bouthern States adopted constitu
tions prohibiting slavery and accepted the
thirteenth amendment. But to the eyes
of the watchful Northern friends of the
emancipated slaves the legislation which
immediately followed in several of tho
States seemed to Impose Inconvenient and
oppressive restrictions upon the colored
population which tended to keep them In
a degraded and practically enslaved con
dition. The Southerners denied any 'in
tention to do more than to provide for'the
absolutely necessary restraints up in a â¢.'la
boring, landless, homeless class," wholly
untrained In freedom. They showed that
the vagrancy laws which were bitterly as
sailed as intolerant and cruel were couchea
in almost exactly, the same terms as those
In - force in some of the \ Northern States,
and ; were certainly : no more severe. But
the * temper i of the Republican Congress
,was such that suspicion of Southern pur
poses respecting their, former slaves could
not be allayed, and a radical policy of re
construction..;, which " should retain the
South in a" condition of : subjection to the
Congressional will until that; body should
be satisfied as to the safety of the freed
men gained favor." :

Few stranger tales of the sea will ever
be told than that which Captain Taylor
of the ship Canada will be able to relate
when his vessel gets here from the Philip
pines, if she ever does.
The Canada left Norfolk, Va., with a
load of coal for the United States war
ships in Manila Bay on August 27, 1S99.
Approaching the Leeuwins bad weather
was encountered, which was followed by
a dead calm. A waterspout came sailing
along and took the mlzzen mast out of
the ship. Early in May of this year the
Canada put into Melbourne. Australia, to
relit. As soon as she docked the coal was
found to be on tire and the vessel had to
be flooded. The coal was discharged, and
after the repairs had been made the coal
was put back again, and on May 23 the
Canada sailed once more. On June 26 she
was towed into Fremantle, Australia,
partially dismasted and in a generally
dilapidated condition. Yesterday the news
came that she had made another start for
Manila, but judging by her present
progress she will not reach San Francisco
before 11*02.

Chatmcy S. Truax, a Prominent Goth
am Councilor, Explains Why
McKinley Will Be the
If ext President." -
Chauncy S. Truax. ."one of the most
prominent and wealthy attorneys of New
York, arrived from Washington State
yesrerday,, 'accompanied by his son and
daughter, and is stopping at the Palace.
Mr. Truaxhas- been oh the Sound several
weeks, inspecting timber lands, of which
he 'and. <jeneral Russell Alger are very
large holders. . Mr. Truax Is tiere for di
m version and this is his first .visit to San
â¢ Pra.nci.sco. It is hardly necessary to say
* that the climate won his admiration the
first day. Mr. Truax is an. old-line Dem
ocrat and has some, pronounced ideas on
rhe political situation which he is not dis-
Inclined to make public, and which are
unusual.
"Yes." eaid he, "'I am a Democrat and
always have been, but I am not one of
Those Democrats who think that Mr.
Bryan will be elected in the coming elec-
. lion. I think there is no question that
. McKinley will be the next President.
There are many reasons for believing so,
luid I have no hesitation in stating them.
"In line with the declaration tha.t Mr.
McKinley will be successful. 1 am quite
Contident that the Republican candidate
will carry every State north of Virginia
and east of the Mississippi River. This
being the case, the West will cut no par
ticular figure. The Pacific Coast is ex
pected to return a solid delegation. Cali
fornia seems to be in the way of genuine
prosperity and not looking for a change in
ftdministration. and will doubtless be in
The Republican column. In Washington
State ine conditions are such that the
prominent Democrats freely declared to
me that there was no hope of the Demo
crats carrying the State. Oregon, of
course, will iÂ»e for McKinley. as Indi
cated by the last State election,
"You ask what special reasons I have
!for expressing such radical views, in view
. of the fact, that I am Iiemocratic in poli
tics.
"A few weeks ago, just before I start
ed for the coast. I dined with seven other
well-known Democrats at the Manhattan
flub in New YÂ«rk. and in the course of
the dinner the subject of politics came to
"in? front and was freely discussed. When
we came to the wind-up it was found that
there was just one man in the crowd who
paid he proposed to vote for Mr. Bryan.
He was from Baltimore, and said a solid
South would he the Democratic candi
date's chare. Before the dinner party
broke up a Northern Democrat had
wagered th^ Southern Democrat $>?00 to
S10" that McKinley would be elected.
"This is merely Incidental as going to
y^how the temper of the intelligent classes
I <f the Democratic party. I am. further
Â¦"lore. convinced that Bryan will be de
bated because there v.-as a large section
c,f the Democratic party that supported
WfKlnley in the laft campaign who have
found no reason why they should not
vole for him at the coming election. The
country is enjoying extreme prosperity.
which should continue under the present
policy. Acain, I am convinced that there
nre many Democrats who voted for
Hryan whose observation? of the progress
of the country during the past three vears
will cause them to vote for McKinley this
year. I have met so many of them that
J have drawn my conclusions partly from
personal observation. New York will give
JlrKinley anywhere from CO.000 to 120.000
pluraiitv."

DEMOCRAT SAYS
BRYAN IS LOST
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MO& DAY, AUGUST 20, 1900.
The Rev. Nelander Declares Every
Offender Nothing Less Than
a Criminal.
Rev. E. Nelander of the First English
Lutheran Church last night preached a
powerful sermon In favor of a better ob
servance of the Sabbath. He took for his
subject "The War on Our Sabbath," and
in part he said:
"With a solitary- exception every one
of the States of the Union has enacted
Sabbath laws. It is a dies non in our
courts and Legislatures. The seculariza
tion of the Sabbath is a violation of the
statutes of our State. Every Sabbath
breaker is a criminal and he who attempts
to override the lawa of the State insults
every American citizen. The fact that cer
tain European countries have little or no
Sabbath observance is not to the point.
This is America. Those who want a go
as-you-please Sabbath are welcome to en
joy it â by recrossfng the Atlantic.
"Even irreligious people would hardly
wish the Sabbath abolished. This was
done In the time of the French revolution,
when the Lord's day was erased from the
calendar, only to be restored after the mobs
had surged through the streets and the
gutters had run with blood. One such
experiment will answer for all time. The
end of the Sabbath would be for the
United States the beginning of the reign
of Mammon, Bacchus and Venus. From
such a fate may the God of Lexington
and Gettysburg deliver us." /
SABBATH BREAKERS ARE

BATTALION OF
FIRST INFANTRY
AT PRESIDIO
Companies, Filled to Maxi
mum, Present a Fine
Appearance.
' Companies C and D of the First Infan
try from Fort Leavenworth arrived at the
Presidio yesterday afternoon . and went
into camp with their comrades of Com
panies A and B, who arrived late . Satur
day night. The four companies comprise
the First Battalion, of the First Infantry
and are commanded by Captains Robert
Getty and F. E. Lacey, Lieutenants J. N.
Pickering, J. B. Murphy and E. E. Car
roll. The men of this battalion are near
ly all recruits, but are a fine looking lot.
Four of the men ,were i sent to the Pre
sidlo in an ambulance, having been taken
sick en route. On examination at the
post hospital one of them was found to
have the measles and was immediately
isolated
It seemed like a special visiting day at
the General Hospital, so great was the
number that applied for passes. The
fruit peddlers disposed of their stock long
before the day was over, and every sick
and convalescent soldier could be seen
contentedly munching the grapes and
pears given them by the kind-hearted
crowd. . . Â¦ Â¦
Sixty-two cavalry horses purchased' by
Colonel Marshall in : the southern part of
the State arrived at the Presidio yester
day afternoon. A great many of the ani
mals lately purchased are to replace the
glandered animals of the Ninth Cavalry
that were killed.

"will" signed Ahnira S. Townsend,
including the "codicil" therein; also
the two envelopes, viz.: The envel
ope bearing thereon the United States
FATE seems to will that Mrs. Bessie
Tracy Smith shall be the predom
inant figure in the sensational de
velopments in the contest over the
fortune of the late Mrs. Almira S. Totvn
eend. An accusing finger is now pointed
at Mrs. Smith by no less a personage than
Handwriting Expert Kytka In a report to
the Chief of Police, based on an exam
ination of the alleged forged will and a
comparison of the fame with the writing
of the former friend of the dead philan
thropist. Kytka has studied and photo
graphed the eponsorless testament so
mysteriously projected into the case last
Friday, and his report of the result of his
Investigations makes things look black In
deed for the accused woman. But one
thing Is lacking against her, according to
Mrs. Murray's friends, and that Is mo
tive. This morning the Grand Jury, act
ing partly on a communication sent them
on Friday last by Sullivan & Sullivan, at
â¢ torneys for Mrs. Ella F. Murray, daugh
ter and claimant for the fortune of Mrs.
Almira Townsend, and partly on Kytka's
report, will subper.a all interested parties,
â¢nd In a ppeciau session, to be held at 7:30
p. m., will investigate the case that ap
pears to promise so well in sensational
cevelopments.
The expert declares that after careful
examination and comparison of the bogus
Â¦will and the acknowledged signatures and
handwriting of Mrs. Townsend, hers was
rot the hand that penned the curious doc
ument. But the question arises. If Mrs.
Bmith really did indite the instrument,
Â¦what could her motive have been? Again,
who is Mrs. M. Bell, whose name appears
as a witness to the bogus testament?
These are the questions every one con
nected with the case but Sullivan & Sulli
van is asking. The former meets with no
response; perhaps the Grand Jury's inves
tigation will elucidate it. The mysterious
Mrs. Bell is thought by all concerned to
be a sort of Mrs. Harris, a-creation put In
for artistic effect by the individual who
evolved the document that has caused
Buch an outburst of righteous indignation
on the part of Mrs. Murray's legal repre
sentatives.
Chief of Detectives Seymour has had
Tnen looking for the retiring will maker
since Friday, but was fain to concede last
night that he or ehe was too ethereal to
locate.
Promise More Sensations.
Sullivan & Sullivan promise all kinds of
sensations when the Grand Jury con
venes to-night, and have lots to say gen
erally about the latest development in
the wrangle over the late Mrs. Town
send'? money. Captain Seymour is silent,
and Mrs. Smith indignantly and tearfuiiy
denies in toto the charges against her
based on Kytka's report, and has en
gaged an attorney to look after her inter
ests, and behind it all J.udge Sullivan pro
fesses to see a mysterions person directing
with a shadowy hand Mrs. Smith's pen,
Â¦while she. acting under the coercion of
this Satanic apparition, whom. Judge Sul
livan is unkind enough to hint is an attor
ney, traces a document of no use to her
ecif or anybody else but Mrs. Ella F.
Murray and Miss Nellie Rattigan. both of
whom indignantly repudiate the document
as spurious. Judge Sullivan's vision, how
ever, is nothing if not comprehensive. Hz
cees lots of people lurking behind Mrs.
Smith in this matter, all urging her to
Â¦write a will which, from the view of disin
terested observers, no self-interest cou'd
have prompted Mrs. Murray's opponents
to indite. He implies that t->ese illusive
bad angels have also a material existence
a.nd eavs that mavbe he will conjure them
Into earthly form before the Grand Jury
to-night.
"This woman," said Judge Sullivan, re
ferring to Mrs. Murray, "is a fighter. My
brother and myself will back her up with
all the fight that Is in us. It is time to
break up this business of Juggling with
the estates of the dead, which Â»Â»as at
tained the 'dignity' of a profession In this
city. This woman Smith wrote that will.
She wrote it under somebody's influence.
There's a whole gang in this thing. My
Virother and myself will go before the
Grand Jurv to-morrow night to do what
tve can to aid thom in the investigation
they are going to make of this matter."
Seymour Is Silent.
Chief of Detectives Seymour," beyond
eaying that He had had men working on
the new development in the case for some
time, declined to talk.
The report which Kytka turned In, ac
companied by photographs of the docu
ments referred to in it, reads as follows:

Mrs. Smith only decided upon securing
Attorney Knight's assistance when sha
was Informed last evening that Handwrit
ing Expert Kytka had submitted his re
port to Chief Sullivan and therein de
clared that she was the writer of the al
ieged bogus will that was sent Miss Rat
tigan through the mail.
Kytka's statement unnerved Mrs. Smith
completely..^. ...
"How can he say it?. How can he!" she
repeated over and over again, interrupt
ing her exclamations with the very point
ed questions: i "Why?: Why should I. do
such a thing?- -Why should I lend myself
to % band of -conspirators? What are
they driving at? , .
"I had intended to go to Judge Dunne's
court to-morrow ." morning," continued
Mrs. Smith, "alone. I see now I must pro
tect myself against these people and must
secure counsel." :And thereupon she
called Attorney Knight up over the tele
phone and the matter was arranged at
once. 1

and business men, who are in close touch with
-all questions affecting and devoted to the wel
fare of San Francisco; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the executive - committee of
the Building Trades' Council, in meeting as
sembled, gladly accepts the suggestion of the
Builders' Association, above stated, and is
willing at any time to submit the entire mat
ter to the Merchants' Association for arbitra
tion, believing as we do that the reasonable
ness and Justice of the request for the elsht
hour day will appeal to the wisdom and sound
business Judgment of any Impartial arbitrator.
The millowners held no meeting yester
day and none has been called for to
day.- It is probable, however, that a
meeting will be held before the day passes
to. consider the question of arbitration.
Several members of the Planing Mill As
sociation who were present at the Build
ers' Association meeting Saturday have
expressed themselves as opposed to let
ting any outside organization determine
the number of hours that their mills shall
be operated. The millmen are hopeful that
the majority of the millowners will re
gard arbitration with favor and will agree
to submit the eight-hour question to the
Merchants' Association for decision.
Whereas, We learn through the public prints
of this morning: that the Builders' Association
at Its meeting last night- adopted the follow
ing resolution: "Resolved, That the Build
ers' Association deplores the present strike and
differences between the owners of planing
mills and their employesâ and we stand ready,
if requested, to use our best efforts to recon
cile the existing differences, and we further
respectfully suggest, both parties consenting to
abide by the decision, that the whole matter
be referred for arbitration to the Merchants'
Association for official action"; and
Whereas, We believe that the request of the
mill employes .for the eight-hour day is Just
and reasonable and If granted will result In
the exclusion from use of the product of mills
working over eight hours, thereby concentrat
ing the entire business In the eight-hour mills
to their rreat pecuniary advantage, and thus
subserve the best interests of all concerned; and
The executive committee of the Build
ing Trades' Council, the body which Is
handling the contest of the striking mill
men for an eight-hour day, expressed It
self yesterday as willing, to submit i the
questions at issue to the arbitration of the
Merchants' Association. At a meeting
held at 10 o'clock yesterday morning a
resolution was passed approving Â¦ of the
suggestion made by the Builders' Associa
tion and pledging the committee to.arbi
tration. The resolution. was as follows:
Planing Mill Association Will Proba

gestion of Builders'
STILL MAINTAINS THAT
THEIR DEMAND IS JUST
Willing to Trust Millmen's
Contest to Fate of Arbi
tration.
