was practical evidence to the other powers of. the good faith
o'f- the United States in this matter. Our work In China has
been accomplished in large part by the relief of the legations,
and our further obligation, that of aiding to restore and main
tain peace, can be accomplished through the troops already on
Chinese soil. â¢
It Is pointed out, however, that in view ofl'the attitude
already assumed by the United States and the large part we
had In opening the way to Peking, this Government is in a
position to demand commercial freedom in China as a mini
mum condition in the final settlement in the event of territorial
division of the Chinese empire, should that be accomplished.
The United States, of course, wants no territory, and it is
felt that her rights as to commercial freedom are too clear to
be dismissed by the other nations Interested.
After the Cabinet meeting to-day there was an extended
conference at the. White House, In which Secretary Root and
Acting Secretary Adee participated. The conference related
to Chinese affairs, and it was said to be confined largely to
considering messages received from other powers on the sub
ject and in drafting answers to them. The suggestion that
the powers be. asked to participate in a conference or to give
some Indication of future purposes In China was believed to
be under consideration, and It was Intimated that notes to the
different powers have- been prepared. Secretary Root said at
the close of 1 the conference that It related to matters which
needed the consideration of tho President and covered the wide
field of Chinese affairs. He explained that nothing had devel
oped of a sensational nature in late reports from China. It
was, stated that the United States Government Is in frequent
communication with the other powers regarding the Chinese
situation.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 24.â The Chinese situation devel
oped little of importance to-day. It is stated frankly
by the officials in the State, War and Navy depart
ments that no dispatches have boon received bear
ing on the problem which has yet to be solved,
namely, the disposition of China's affairs at the hands of the^
powers. In the absence of other food for speculation the re
ceipt of two casualty lists from General Chaffee, dated Tien
tsin, were made the bp.sls for a report that he and the Ameri
can force had evacuated Peking. It was stated at the. War
Department, however, that no advices have been received in
dicating that General Chaffee had left Peking, and it was said
that he would have advised the War Department and given
his reasons for doing so had he contemplated such an impor
tant step.
A Cabinet officer Is authority for the statement that alleged
differences among the powers brought on by the reported ac
tion of Russia have not disturbed this Government in the least
and that there Is no information in possession of this Govern
ment that Russia has declared war or that she is pursuing
a course in any way different from that of other governments
represented In China. It was also said that the statements
regarding Russia had not received consideration at the meet
ing of the Cabinet to-day.
Regarding the attitude of. this Government in case differ
ences among the powers should arise as to their future course
In China, it was stated on authority to-day that this Govern
ment remained opposed to any territorial division of China, as
was plainly stated in Secretary Hay's note of July 3. Every
resource of diplomacy will be exhausted to prevent partition
of the empire, and it was stated that the diversion of American
troops to Manila, already announced by the War Department,

NEBRASKA MAY LOSE

Census Returns Show a Great De-
crease in the Population of
the State.
Special DUnatch to The Call.
OMAHA. Aug. 24.-The Impression pre
vails that Nebraska^ population has de
creased to such an extent that the State
will be deprived of one of its six Con
gressmen when the new apportionment
shall have been made.
Ex-Congressman Strode has figured out
from the returns, official and otherwise,
which have thus far been received from
various points in the State, that the pop
ulation of Nebraska will be about 100 000
less according to the 1900 census than it
was according to the 1S90 census. Ho
thinks the next Congress will be almost
certain to raise the number of people
required for representation in Con
gress. The number of people neces
sary for a Congressman is 173.000, but the
next Congress will probably raise the
number to 2OO.0CO. Nebraska would lose
one Congressman on this account and the
State Legislature at Us next session will
probably anticipate the action of Con
gress by redlstrictlng the State.

der of William Goebel. when he taiked to
reporters at : the County Jail to-day.
"This, too." he continued, "after I told
my guards that I would give them my
word that I would make no attempt to

not only useless, but foolish, ir I had

on their return to the vessel, meeting a
Japanese, they set upon him and beat him
to death on the roadway. The only prov
ocation appears to have been that he had
no cigarettes to give them when they
asked him for some. The victim was
beaten with fists and sticks and at the
end one of the natives seized a fence
plank and struck the Japanese a blow
that laid his stomach open. The victim
was found dead on the road by a coun
tryman, the natives having run away and
left him when he lay helpless.

NEW YORK, Aug. 24.â The Presbyte

"PEKING, Aug. 20.â Xorth China Chris

This is interpreted as meaning that the

asked as a thank offering for the rescue
of the Christians in Peking.
The petition is sent coniolntly by Mis

VICEROYS ARE FRIENDLY.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 24.â The first as
surances reached here to-day that the
powerful Chinese Viceroys were disposed
to accept the new conditions of affairs
In China and would assist in the main
tenance of peace. The information came
In a dispatch through diplomatic chan
nels, and stated that one of the foreign
officers had received a telegram from
two of the most powerful central Vice
roys stating that they intended to gi\>
their best efforts to maintaining quiet
throughout the central portions of China.
As this assurance came subsequent to
the capture of Peking it Is regarded as a
favorable sign of disposition of the Vice
roys, whose authority in the interior lsr
very great. Their course has been
watched with much concern by officials,
for since Peking is in a chaotic condi
tion the most Influential authority in the
empire is that of the Viceroys.
MAHTNES SENT TO TIENTSIN.

CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASH
INGTON, Aug. 24. â Notwithstanding the measures
adopted by the Viceroys of Southern China to prevent
an anti-foreign demonstration, there was an outbreak to-day at
Amoy, greatly endangering American interests. Consul John
son, it is believed, has impressed the authorities with the seri
ousness of the outbreak at Amoy, and the probability that it may .
lead to a spread of the revolt throughout Southern China. In
view of the gravity of the situation, instructions Avere sent late
this afternoon to Rear Admiral Remey, at Takti, embodying the
information from Mr. Johnson and directing him to order a man
of-war to proceed at once to Amoy. Should the commander of
the warship to be sent find that American lives and property are
in danger he will land marines, otherwise not. The Navy De
partment has impressed upon Admiral Remey the policy adopt
ed by the President of landing men only for the specific
purpose of protecting American life and property. American
marines have not been landed at Shanghai, though British
troops and French bluejackets are on shore at that point, nor
will they be landed unless a native uprising should occur and
American interests be threatened.
LOXDOX, Aug. 25, 3:45 a. m. â Five hundred American
troops participated in the signal defeat of Boxers outside
of Tientsin on August 19. The fact is briefly reported from
Vienna. Details of the engagement come from the Reuter
agent at Tientsin in a dispatch dated August 20. In addition to
the Americans the force consisted of 375 British and 200 Japan
ese â all under the British General Dorward. The fight took
place at a village six miles southwest of Tientsin, where the al
lied forces found a considerable number of Boxers, whom they
engaged, killing over three hundred and taking sixty-four
wounded prisoners, who were sent to the hospitals of the allies>
The village was burned. The Americans had five wounded, the
Japanese six and the British none. Hundreds of Boxer flags,
spears and swords were captured.
From Shanghai comes a report, qualified by the assertion
that it is from purely Chinese sources, that the Empress Dow
ager, after proceeding one day's journey from Peking, became
terrified at the looting by General Tung Fuh Siang's troops and
went back to Peking.
A Chinese telegram from Tsinannu says that Prince Tuan
has been captured by a detachment of the allies. Other Chinese
messages record the formation of a provisional government in
Peking by the allies, but this appears to be a purely military meas
ure and merely an elaboration of the scheme for dividing' the city
into sections for police purposes.
L.i Hung Chang has received word that the allies, entered
Peking easily because the troops of General Tung Fuh Siang
utterly refused to face the allies. According to the Shanghai cor
respondent of the Daily Express Earl Li, recognizing the futility
of an attempt to drive the foreigners from China, now professes
conversion to reform principles.
Shanghai advices announce the receipt there of a Chinese
official dispatch asserting that Emperor Kwang Su has been
found and rescued by the Japanese.
Messages from Tientsin report serious mortality among the
American horses, owing to the heat.
Delayed advices to Reuter, dated Peking, August 14, reit
erate the statements regarding the treachery of the Chinese
from the night before the relief. They had informed the mem
bers of the legations that orders had been issued to cease firing.
This was followed by a desperate attack, and it was only the wel
come sound of the cannon of the relieving force in the morning
that renewed the courage of the foreigners. The correspondent
adds: "The Chinese admit having lost 3000 in the various at
tacks upon the legations. Our rations dwindled to one pound
a day, consisting of horseflesh and rice. When the American de
tachment attacked, the whole Chinese force concentrated
against them, leaving the Sha-Ho gate unwatched. whereupon
the British entered there without the loss of a man/'

PEKING, Aug. 19 (via Chefu, Aug. 23, and Shanghai, Aug. 24).â The situation here is unchanged. The allied commanders have still had no
communication with the Chinese Government. Future movements of the American forces depend upon instructions which are awaited from
the home government. The allied commanders have not yet come: to any agreement about the final occupation of the Imperial Palace, where
great treasure is supposed to exist. : â¢ JOHN F. BASS.

MORMON ELDER
CHARGED WITH
BRUTAL MURDER
,/ ,
Accused of Hurling a Child
Under the Wheels of a
Moving Train. \
Chief of Police at St. Louis Takes His
Statement and Releases Him
for Want of Evi
dence.
â¢ '
ST. LOUIS. Aug. 24.-Elder Aaron S.
Hawkes. missionary of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, was ar
rested at the Four Courts, accused of
pushing Clarence Fuhrer, 5 years old, to
his death beneath a moving train at
Mount Vernon, Ind., at an early hour to
day. Hr- was arrested as the Louisville
and Nashville train steamed Into the
Union depot this morning.
Elder Hawkins, who lives at Manassas,
Conejos County, Colorado, was returning
from seven months : .of proselyting in
Georgia when he is said to have become
the instrument of Baby Fuhrer' s death.
John M. Pierce of Mount Carvel, 111.,
and Orvln B. Grays of Evansville, Ind.,
passengers on 'the train, witnessed the
injury to the child. Conductor F. M. Al
bln states that these passengers were
willing to testify that Hawkins deltbel
ately hurled the baby from the moving
train to the platform and that they saw
the little fellow roll from the platform
under the wheels, which passed over him.
Hawkins will be held here subject to the
orders of the police officials oÂ£ 1 Mount
Vernon.
Mrs. Amelia Fuhrer boarded Conductor
Albin's train at Evansville, Ind., twenty
miles from the scene of the tragedy. She
had with her two small children, Clarence
and a younger sister. She was on her
way to Mount Vernon, Ind., to join her
husband. At Mount Vernon she-arose to
leave the train, and here is where the
Mormon came on the scene. He told his
story as follows:
"The woman was leaving the train. I
stepped out on the platform while the
train was slightly in motion and lifted the
child down to the platform. It was un
steady on Its feet and rolled off the plat
form. I jumped on the sleeping-car as It
swung past me on -the end of. the train.
I did not push the child off."
The Chief of Police at Mount Vernon.
Ind., telegraphed Chief of Police. Campbell
late to-day to take the statement of Elder
Hawkins and release him,; as the police
have no evidence â¢ on . which to hold Â¦ him.
He was accordingly released.
Tweed whether a legacy amounting to
$50,000 would be paid by securities of the
par value or market value of $50,000. Mr.
Tweed replied, that that was a question
which would have to be left to the ex
ecutors to work out, and he had no doubt
they would deal fairly with every one
concerned.
HENRY L HUNTINGTON
TO CONTROL HOLDINGS
XEW YORK. Aug. 24.â Henry E. Hunt
ington will represent henceforth the
Huntington holdings of the Southern Pa
cific. The opinion his uncle held of him
an3 which led to the bequeathing to the
younger, man of this power in the road's
affairs is illustrated by something that
Denis Kearney, who was close in the
railroad king's confidence, recently wrote
to a San Francisco newspaper: "I had a
talk with Mr. Huntington a day or two'
before he left for the East." wrote Mr.
Kearney. "i asked him about buving
Southern Paciiic stock. He said: 'If you
buy and hold it for live years 1 will guar
antee you will not lose any money, for by
that time 1 shall have it on a dividend
paying basis.' I said: 'But, Mr. Hunt
ington, suppose you should die? What
then? 1 He replied: 'Why. there is Ed
(H. E. Huntington). No better boy ever
lived. He has been with me twenty
eight years and knows a thing or two
about railroads. I'll trust him.' "
It by no me.ins follows, however, that
Henry E. Huntington is to become the
new president of the Southern Pacific
Company. Mr. Huntington's holdings
were short of being a majority of the.
stock, as Isaac E. Gates, his brother-in
law, said to-day. They are estimated as
being very far short of being a majority,
in fact. The capital stock of the company
is $200,000,000, or two million shares. The
ttoek commands in the market about $33
to $34 a share. Mr. Huntington is bellsved
to hava owned about 450,00o shares. None
of his business associates would "make
any definite statement on this point, how
ever, to-day, or as to the amount of his
estate. - '
Charles H. Tweed, testator's counsel;
Isaac E. Gates, Speyer & Co. and the
Union Trust Company, which was made
trustee for some of the important be
quests, all decline to discuss the matter.
Mr. Gates said in fact that he was unable
to estimate Mr. Huntington's fortune.
Russell Sage's estimate of the value of
the Huntington estate is about $25,000,000.
Russell Sage said -of Huntington's will:
"It is a very good, sensible sort of will.
It provides for the keeping of Mr. Hunt
ington's Southern Pacific stock in the
family.- I thoroughly approve the pro
vision by which Mrs. Huntington and
Henry E. Huntington are each enioined
from selling any of the Southern Pacific
stock without the consent of the other.
Mr. Huntington, no doubt, felt that when
he had passed away influence might be
brought to bear to cause a distribution
of Southern Pacific holdings, and he took
good care to make this difficult. The fact
that he wanted this stock kept in the
Huntington family shows how confidently
he looked forward to the future of the
Southern Pacific road." \ . ... .

powers to the executors.
Not for Husband's Debts.
It is provided in the fourteenth article
of the will that should any sums held In
trust under articles 5, 6 and 7, setting
aside J500.000 for Mrs. Isabella D. Hunt
inglon, the widow; $250,000 for Archer M.

for the Princess Hatzfeldt, the adopted

otherwise, the executors are authorized

pal or income, out of any other funds of
the estate remaining . in their hands if
there be any such not specifically appoint
ed under the foregoing provisions of the
will. In all S2,*JCS,000 in cash bequests Is
given, besides the leal estate, securities,
paintings and other articles. The absence
of any statement of the security holcling3
makes it difficult to estimate the value of
the estate. The will declares that all the
bequests made^to the Princess Hatzfeldt
nnd to other married women are for their
pole use and not liable for the debts of
their husbands. Â¦ ,
Power Terminated by Death.
Article 17 authorizes Mrs. Huntington,
as executrix, or such attorney or substi
tute as she may appoint, to join with
Charles F. Crocker and Stlllman & Hub
bard, or their respective attorneys orper
ponal representatives, in executing of in
dorsing commercial paper. (This power
Is terminated by the death of Charles F.
Crocker and the dissolution of Stillman

The articles following are purely legal,
the twenty second ' providing that any
beneficiary contesting the will shall for
feit his share In it.
The will was filed for probate In the
Surrogate's office to-day. The petition
asking that the Instrument be admitted
to probate does not give the value of the
estate. , Charles H. Tweed, Mr. Hunting
ton's attorney, said he could not place
any value on it. Mr. Tweed was asked
what would be the value of the bequests
in which it is provided that either money
or securities of the par value of , the sum
of money mentioned may be given by the
executors,. but he said he was not yet- in
a position to. reply.
The question having arisen as tn wlwt

sums named could be given to the bene
ficiaries instead of ' money/ a representa

NLW YORK, Aug. 24.â Those who should have a large knowledge of Mr. Huntington'* affairs figure
that he left behind in one way or another from $25,000,000 to $35,000,000. Some of his inter
ests were enormous. That in the Southern Pacific has been run up as high as Â§45,000,000. It' is said to
be about 812,000.000. In the Pacific Improvement Company, capital $5,000,000, which owns the Hotel
del Slonte, at Monterey, worth $2,500,000, and Arcadia, at Santa Monica, and the mines of Castle Crag,
in the Upper Sacramento Valley near Shasta, Mr. Huntington's interest is computed at $2,500,000. The
Huntington interest at Newport News cannot, it is claimed, be less than $6,000,000. In the Pacific Mail

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Aug. 24.â News brought by
steamship Tacoma. that arrived to
day from Nome, reports the most
terrific storm ever known on Bering
Sea, which raged from August 7 for
five days, causing a loss of hundreds of
thousands of dollars and many lives.
When the steamer left twenty bodies had
been washed ashore, 'none of which had
been identified so far as the passengers
en the steamer know. Reports from the
beach all the way from Golovin Bay
westward were of loss of life all along
the shore.
The Tacoma and other large steamers
at anchor steamed out to sea for safety
when the storm began, but schooners,
lighters, small steamers and all manner
of small craft were wrecked, excepting a
few that succeeded in getting into the
river before the storm became violent.
Sailing vessels dragged their anchors and
went on the beach, where for miles all
manner of craft are piled in heaps of
wreckage, together with merchandise,
lumber, coal and other materials, includ
ing many mining pumps, engines and
boilers used in beach wprking.
The storm came on with great fury, the
waves dashing over the beach nearly up
to Main street, wrecking many buildings
and tents. The air was filled with flying
debris, driven before the fierce gale, and
many persons were injured. Along the
shore hundreds ot men were at work at
tempting to save goods from the sea, and
were caught by the waves and carried
out, only to be dashed back on the beach,
bruised and unconscious, or washed out
to sea and drowned.
One wrecked boat containing five men
wns washed ashore at Topkuk and all the
bodies recovered. One of the bodies was
identified aa that of a man named
Hughes. A letter was found on his body
addressed to Jake Berger, a I>aniels
Creek mine owner. The bodies were all
buried near the place where they were,
found. Five bodies were washed ashore in
the vicinity of Nome City, three at the
mouth of Nome River, and from reports,
three more several miles up the coast.
With the exception of a young fellow
aged 25, named Crowly. none had been
identified when the Tacoma loft. Crow
ly was drowned on August 11. He was
rowing in a small dory. Hi? boat was
seen to capsize in the surf and when hls>
body was washed ashore there was quite
a crowd of people waiting for it on the.
beach Several doctors tried to resus
citate him. tfut to no avail.
The first bad storm of thÂ«Â» season was
dn August 2, when much property was
saved and large claims for salvage made.
The storm of later date was much more
fierce and destructive, and the ' salvers
were surprised and" overwhelmed by the
waves. - Since August 2. when the rains
began the mud has been deeper and the
streets almost impassable. The tundra is
soft and the tents situated off Main street
can be reached only by the greatest dif
liculty. pedestrians sinking to the nips in
the soft mud. . _
About 10.000 people have gone out ana
more are going by every steamer. - .

destruction of property and, what evi
dently was th<? desire of the Kelly and
Crimmins heelers, a big row. ThÂ« officers
placed S. J. Campbell, James Nolan (also
an employe of Scott) and W. J. Maskell
under arrest, charging them with disturb
ing the peace. These men In turn pre
ferred charges against Edward Nolan for
breaking the ballot-box. He was arrested
and charged with malicious mischief, but
was Immediately released on a cash bond.
At No. 2 polling place of the Thirty

rooms of a Faloon, a disgraceful row oc
curred at 3 o'clock. The election officers,
consisting of James Nolan, Harry Hall,
W. Kane, George Brown and James
Sweeney, were attending to the business
intrusted to them. Edward Nolan, the
county committeeman of the district, en
tered the room where the ballot-box rest
ed on a table in front of the window. At
the same time S. J. Campbell, a brother
in-law of Phil Crimmins and a deputy In
the office of Harry Scctt. the Tax Col
lector, entered the room and made a grab
for the box with the evident Intention of
smashing it. Nolan tried to prevent the
Kelly hf-eler from destroying the ballots,
and a small sized row was precipitated,
fn which the plass front of the ballot-box
was smashed and the ballots strewn about
the floor. During the melee heelers on
the outside threw bundles of folded bal
lots among those on the floor.
In the Thirty-first District, which Is lo
cated above the section of the south-of-
Market-street dividing line, where Kelly
and Crimmins iieelers could not stuff the
box, there was trouble Incidental to a
primary where no laws can be evoked for
protection against roughs and opium
6inokers who take orders from the bosses.
Riot in Thirty-First District
The anti-Crimmlns men tried to force
open the door of the polling place, but the
policemen on duty prevented them, and
realizing that few anti-boss ballots would
be counted if cast into that box they
opened a polling place of their own just
across the street at 10:30 o'clock. For
the remainder of the day peace reigned
supreme in the Mint saloon district. Vot
ing wont on uninterruptedly, each voter
choosing his voting place according to his
own predilections. It was a greater exer
cise of liberty than Is usually permitted
even to free-born Americans. In the Sec
ond Precinct the same scene -was enacted,
and the McNamara faction opened a poll-
Ing place at Fourth and Shipley streets,
the Kelly-Crimmlns men holding forth at
416 Fourth street. In the First Precinct
the north of Jessie ballot-box received 323
votes for the Kelly-Crimmins ticket and
22 for the anti-boss ticket, while in the
south of Jessie ballot-box there were de
posited 317 votes for the anti-boss ticket
and 3 for the Kelly-Crimmlns candidates.
At 7 o'clock "Jack" McNamara and the
election board whose credentials had been
signed by Chairman Bouvier and Secre
tary Wilson appeared at tho designated
polling- place. 3CS Jessie street, and de
manded admission. The Kelly-Crimmins
men had the door bolted and the window
raised about six inches, so that voters
might pass their ballots through to the
guardian anRf-ls in charge of the box.

morning. When Mr. Fisher tendered hi.<
ballot. the polling officers laughed at him
but after Mr. Hart and Fisher made their
united complaint : against such unfai"
methods the officers condescended to al
low him to vote. Mr. Fisher's name was
therefore voted twice.
Tommy Conboy, a prominent factor in
Democratic politics In the Forty-third
District, changed political â¢ coats for the
occasion and made himself obnoxious to
the decent Republicans. He was chal
lenged repeatedly for voting and succeed
ed in obstructing the voting. Joseph FÂ«i
gan, known as "Napoleon" Fagan of base
ball and political affairs, and who is also
a Democrat, voted In behalf of Kelly ai.d
Crimmins.
Mr. Hart asked Corcoran if he was not
ashamed of himself for voting another
man's name, but the stuffer unblushingly
Ignored the rebuke. The Kelly and Crim
mins fellows inside the booth came to the
stuffer's rescue by yelling "What of it?
Vote anyhow." Mr. Corcoran voted.
A young man named Dunphy voted the
name of Timothy G. Murphy of 211 Proa
pect place, and i twenty minutes later
brazenly returned and voted the name of
Michael Clay, who resides at 1025 Clay
street. Mr. Hnrt objected to this high
handed voting and protested to the in
spector of the .booth. John Kavanaugh
backed him up} The latter said to Dun
phy, "Yes, you 'voted already," and again
the Kelly and Crimmins voices inside the
booth replied in unison. "What fell If he
did? Let him vote again." voted
again.
The work of Kelly and Crimmins'
henchmen in the Forty-third District was
bo criminal that the policemen who were
present to. keep order blushed for shame.
Despite the protestations of J. D. Hart
and George J. Boyne stuffing went on
with a freedom that was startling in the
extreme. In the second polling place
"Bob" Corcoran, a notorious politician of
that district, voted often. He walked up
to the ballot-box without fear and cast
the votes of honorable men who had not
the opportunity to vote. He voted the
name of Charles \V. Will of 216 Prospect
place and when Mr. Hart, who was pres
ent to prevent stuffing.- protested his ob
jection was overruled by the hirelings of
the bosses, who played havoc with the
ballot-boxes In the booth.
Made Policemen Blush.
Balloting at Twenty-fourth and Folsom
streets was quiet and brisk. More than
two hundred representative Republicans
cast their ballots In the cause of decency.
Kelly and Crimmins had two large bal
lot-boxes filled with votes before the noon
hour, one at Twenty-fourth streeet and
Potrero avenue, and the other in the back
room of a saloon at Twentieth and Illi
nois streets.
A. J. Martin and Jack Welsh looked
after the County Committee's Interests In
the Thirty-third District. All was quiet,
possibly due to the fact that the opposi

parts of the district. It is claimed that
Martin Kelly secured ballot-boxes for his

Augustus Tilden, mouthpiece of Bosses
Kelly and Crimmins, appeared before the
returning board -with a proposition from
his superiors which was not entertained.
The rival faction was anxious to bring
its returns over to the Baldwin Annex,
but declined to do so unless it received as
surances from the board that it would
consent to have the County Committee
as e. whole act on the protests. Mr. Til
den's overtures fell on deaf ears and he
wa~ obliged to withdraw and Inform the
bosses of his failure. The matter now
resolves itself into a bitter fight which
will not end until right is recognized.
The bosses will attempt in three ways to
defeat the upholders of clean politics.
They will In all probability resort to a
discussion on credentials and will attempt
to prove their cause by producing the au

Boss, Fared at the Polls.
How the Candidates, Boss and Anti-
County Committeeman Frank Worth
foiled the attempt ot Kelly and Crimmins
ruffians to gain control of the ballot box
in the Thirty-ninth Assembly District.
The voting booth at 1032 Sutter street was
about to close when the hirelings of the
bosses made a descent on the booth. Mr.
Worth divined their purpose and pre
vented them carrying out their nefarious
work. No blows were struck, but for a
short time the air was tilled with warm
discussion and a battle royal was immi
nent. The bosses' henchmen seeing that
they could not gain possession of the bal
lots cast by the citizens, withdrew to a
nearby saloon and drowned their disap
pointment In drink.
RESULTS OF THE CANVASSES.
Scheme of Bosses Foiled.
Returns show that in the Ruef ballot
boxes out of SJ6 votes cast the boss ticktt
received 55. Eddie Buckley's returns gave
his own faction 256 votes, against 22 for
the Ruef ticket.
same way. The boss element opened busi
ness for themselves, but at no time were
they a possible factor in the fight.
After the polls closed Ruef's end made
a return to the Baldwin Annex head
quarters and the opponents, headed by
County Committeeman Eddie Buckley,
brought their ballots to the Shiels build
ing. Charges of crooked work were made
by both sides, but the boss outfit ac
knowledged that Ruef was the ov/ner.of
the district.
In the Forty-fourth District Abe Ruef
beat out the Kelly and Crimmins^ faction
quite handily. At both polling plnces.his
opponents, realizing that their cmtnees of
a showing were slim, opened voting head
quarters of their own. In tho First Pre
cinct I Maurice Bushway assumed ; charge
of f the new polls and hustled : about for
votes, but Ruef himself was close at hand
and got the Â¦; majority of the voters to
throw their ballots with his faction. The
polls-were not far apart, and both
slcles were. well supplied with "scrappers"
not a Â¦single fight occurred. Farther down
near the beach affairs shaped about the
Kuef Wins Decisive Victory.
The bosses proved themselves astute
and scheemtng politicians by their suc
cessful plan to disrupt and corrupt the
voting In the second polling: place in the
Fortieth District. That they succeeded
was borne out by the successful manner
In which their hirelings manipulated the
votes. The story of their crime came to
light last night when C. G. Bolsdorff.,,in
spector of the booth, loudly proclaimed
that he wanted a receipt for his ballots,
lie shouted that 365' votes had been cast
for Kahn and 204 for Fitzgerald, and that
the board refused to sign the tally
sheets. He called attention to a pack
age which rested in the ballot-box, which
he said contained votes that were pro
tested because they fell out of the box
when it was thrown down the cellar. In
spector Bolsdorff having secured his re
ceipt and left, the true story of boss
methods came to the surface.
It appears that after the polls were
closed and the officers were counting the
ballots, a number of hirelings of the
bosses tried to enter the booth and gain
possession of the ballot-box. Their
threatening front was only a feint, but
to show that they were in earnest they
broke in a plate-glass window. The
policeman on duty jumped . into the
breach and strove to hurl the hirelings
back, and during the excitement Inspec
tor Bolsdorff, who was in league with
the bosses, by a premeditated move
grabbed the ballot-box and hurled it
through a trap-door into the cellar. C.
M. Dillon, who was in sympathy with
the Countjl Committee, saw through the
scheme in a Jiffy and followed the ballot
box through the trap-door. He arrived
in the cellar in time to see a number of
Kelly and Crlmmins men diligently en
gaged in stuffing the box. He grabbed
the box and tossed it back Into the room.
During these exciting proceedings a num.
ber of ballots fell on the floor and beÂ«
came contaminated in the eyes: of the
board. Trie policeman having forced the
crowd back, the ballot-box was rescued
and quiet once more reigned in the camp.
In the first precinct of the Fortieth dis
trict the same state of affairs existed.
No window was broken, but the contents
of the ballot-box were dumped on' the
floor by the. Inspector, and a clerk whllt
supposedly engaged in rescuing the votes
emptied his pockets of a hundred folded
ballots and they were counted with those
legitimately cast. , _
F. \V. Meyer, County Committeeman
from the district and a number of prom,
inent citizens are ready to file affidavits
with the County Committee to prove that
the ballots were intentionally or acci
dentally strewn on the floor by Harry
Baehr, the acting Inspector, and that
Harry Thompson, who acted as clerk,
added more ballots to those originally
cast. There Is every likelihood of a stiff
contest, before the County Committee to
night. A strong protest win be made
against accepting the votes and testi
mony will be given to prove that dirty
politics was resorted to by unscrupulous
politicians.
Bosses Win in the Fortieth.
The bosses went down- to ignominious
defeat in the Thirty-fourth District, not
withstanding the strenuous efforts of each
man on the push ticket. They brought
their henchmen to the polls in vehicle*, of
every description, but the respectable cit
izens of the district pursued the . even
tenor of their way and elected their dele
gates by a large maiority.
E. I. Robinson, who headed the list of
local delegates on the boss ticket, and
who made himself conspicuous by an open
espousal of the cause of bossism. met with
his just deserts, being defeated by George
L. Onter by a vote of 474 to 208.
Bosses Ignominiously Defeated.
neighboring saloon and within a short
time half a, dozen rounders, tilled with
drink, would roll over to the voting place
and cast the votes of honest men. The
decent element was helpless and had to
stand by and watch the criminals work.
According to a well-known citizen of the
district between twenty and thirty Kelly
and Crimmins rowdies voted throughout
the day with freedom and frequency.
Their presence in the district simpiy
frightened the citizens and they remained
away from the booth.
After the polling place had closed an at
tempt was made to steal the ballots. One
of the rowdies started to leave the place
with the precious papers in his pockets,
but was captured in his night by Police
man Barry. The latter turned the ballots
over to Inspector J. J. Kavanaugh, and
the latter, accompanied by Mr. Boyne, the
county commltteeman of the district, and
a gang of protesting Kelly and Crimmins
men, marched to the rooms of the County
Committee in the Baldwin Annex. Mr.
Hillman and Chairman Alfred Bouvier
were present to receive the ballots and the
room was crowded with politicians and
policemen. Fortunately the latter were
present in force, otherwise some fighting
might have resulted. The men were at
fever heat. Charges and counter-charges
were mada in loud voices, and it was
necessary for Sergeant Christenson and
his squad to clear the room before the
tangle could be straightened out.
Mr. Boyne demanded that Inspector
Kavanaugh turn the ballots over to the
County Committee and demanded silence
until the inspector, who was badly "rat
tled" bv the confusion, could explain how
the ballots had been stolen and recovered.
Policeman Barry was called upon to make
his statement, after which a receipt for
the "purported" ballots was turned over
to the inspector and a duplicate which was
loudly demanded by John P. Carlln and
J. P. Crowley. the poolseller. was hanied
to those parties. The room was again
cleared, and within a few minutes an
other squabble was on the tapis.
fy AREFUL estimates made at a late hour last night show
\j that the bosses will not be able to organize or control
the local nominating convention of the Republican par
ty. The opposition to Kelly and Crimmins has triumphed in
the following Assembly Districts: Twenty-ninth, Thirty-first,
Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth, Thirty
seventh, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth and Forty-fourth. These
large districts have 151 of the 250 delegates.
According to the face of returns, some of them being
notoriously fraudulent and illegal, Kelly and Crimmins may
be able to control the following districts: Twenty-eighth?
Thirtieth, Thirty-eighth. Forty-first, Forty-second, Forty
third and Forty-fifth. These boss-ridden districts will be
represented by ninety-one delegates.
The Thirty-second District with nine delegates is
classed as doubtful.
Leaders of the anti-boss element in the County Com
mittee are confident that the opposition to Kelly and Crim
mins will organize the convention and dictate the nomina
tions.
A survey of the field shows that E. I. Wolfe has lost his
fight for renomination to the Senate in the Twenty-first
Senatorial District.
Democrats marshaled by Rainey, Lanigan and Herrin
assisted Kelly and Crimmins in the invasion of the Forty
first District. The result is the election, on the face of the
returns, of the Dibble ticket.
The returning board of the County Committee will be
called upon to deal with the affairs of this district. Dibble
may be nominated again for the Legislature, but independ
ent Republicans are already insisting that his record shall be
produced in order to insure his defeat.

feature of which the reputable Repuo

Democrat, was one of the most active
workers for the Dibble ticket. He and
"lilliy" JBarton spent the day in steer-

Democrats Voted for Dibble.
It will be shown to the returning board
that the corrupt bosses of the Kelly-
Ciimmins faction resorted to ballot box
smashing when cheating and repeating
could not succeed. Kelly Is an old-time
ballot box smasher. If he cannot stuff a
box he proceeds to smash it.
The Republican party of Ban Francisco
expects the returning board appointed by
the County Committee to do its duty.
There can be no compromise with fraud.
Credentials cannot in honor and Justice
be issued to rw-n who gained advantage
In the voting by downright cheating and
repeating on the part of their supporters.
It is essential to the welfare of the Re
publican party and to the cause of clean
government in San Francisco that the
members of the returning board shall
fairly and impartially consider the testi
mony. It is true that twenty thousand
Republican voters neglected to participate
In the primary election yesterday, but
their support will be needed to elect the
Republican ticket next November. No
doubt they regarded a primary- election
Â¦without the protection of law as a farce
L.nd a sham and purposely refrained from
voting, but they will vote next November
and vote the Republican ticket if boss in
iluences do r.ot prevail in the nominating
convention.
Resolved. That the committee hereby Insists
that a free and untrammeled ballot and an
faonÂ«St coast raut-t be enforced at said primary
electlon; that all attempts to deviate from this
j rir.cij le should be discountenanced, and that
tbOM euilty of frauds or parties thereto should
be debarred from all conventions, and that if
it shall appear at any polling place that there
is or has been any fraud or wrong committed,
cr the rirht of any citizen to cast his free
luid ur.trainir.eled ballot and to have the same
hom-stly counted, has been In any way inter
., ,. , ,,-jui. *JbÂ« committee In charge shall set
tside ad declare null and void the election
at *aid polling place and report their action
to the different conventions, who shall take
action in such matter and decide which eet
of delegates Is entitled to a eeat la the con
vention.
The issue now rests with the returning
board. It is for the board to decide
whether fraud or right shall prevail. The
offlcial call for the election, promulgated
by the County Committee, contains this
declaration:
Rests With .Returning Board.
<T T must be obvious now to every fair
minded citizen that the Republican
County Committee acted wisely in ap
i> pointing- a returning board of repu
table men to canvass the Primary
election returns. If the board were not in
position and clothed with authority to
protect the right of the people, the Re
publican Convention to nominate Superior
Judges. Justices of the Peace and mem
bers of the Legislature might be assem-
Ued at the Mint saloon, and the places
en the ticket auctioned off to the highest
The number of legitimate votes polled
at the primary election yesterday was
not large The whole number of ballots
cast did not exceed 9000. In the polling
jiiaces where the bosses had the majority
of election officers there was no pretense
of fairness. Fraud was openly practiced
and applauded by the stutters. Demo-,
crats voted often and occasionally voted
two ballots at a whack. Rounders and
non-resident loafers from the tenderloin
precincts obtained from the printed regis
ters the names of reputable residents, and
Â¦with the connivance and assistance of
election officers voted such names. Hun
dreds of affidavits setting fortli the names
of the persons who voted fraudulently
can be presented to the returning board.

were voted to prove that they did not go

Frisco ball-tossers have suffered a re
pulse, and the local fans are still talking
of that terrible inning In which the Dudes
swatted Iburg. the idol, all over the lot.
The impression made upon the spectators
was that Iburg was slugged unmercifully
and that the Frlscos went to pieces. The
tabulated score also indicates that such
was the case, but the fact is that Hank's
men also encounteredr a bunch of hard
luck crowded into the single inning..
This week the Friscos begin a new
series with Sacramento on the home
grounds of tho champions, and the fans
will, no doubt see some very good ball.
It is a feature of this season's games, the
mix-up between San Francisco and Sac
ramento. Whenever, the champions and.
the local contingent clash, the crowd la
out, hooting and cheering. Although San
Francisco jumped from the tail end posi
tion to second place, it seems that a set
back is always thrust at them when least
expected. The champions are running a
strong leader pace, but the percentage
separation is growing less and less.

Anglers Are Returning
The anglers are retiming to the city af
ter their lone vacations and from this
time on fishing excursions will be for a
day or two at most.
The Truckee River is losing its crowd
of whippers very fast. In certain sections
the fishing is still rood, but the general
report p are not as bright as those of a
few weeks ago.
Harry Golchor tried Verdi early In the
week with indifferent lurk. l^e found
fpoon fishing good, but fly fishing very
poor. Dave Sax:hs and Jim Turner were
on the fame ground and they give the
Mime verdict.
A cloudburst near Boca last Sunday left
the river muddy and this played havoc
Â¦with the fishermen.
Mr. Blackburn left for Boca Thursday
night for a few days.
Colonel Kc-liehor will tfy Eel River next
week. This will be the favorite Ftream
for the ensuing four weeks.
J. B. Kennilt and C. R. Kenniff tried
San Antonio. Schultz and Petaluma
creeks, but met with no great luck. Since
their return the bass have been running
hotter in these plough*. In Midshipman's
Slough a No.i4 Wilson's spinner proved a
good allurement.
George H. Powers has returned from
lioca with tales of marvelous catches. He
struck a. live pool.
Four of the six series of matches be
tween the Alameda, Pacific and Califor
nia cricket clubs have now been played
and the Alamedas have obtained a sub
stantial lead, the Pacifies second and last
year's pennant winners last.
All through the season the Californlas
have depended almost entirely on the ef
forts of Arthur Dickenson, E. G. Sloman,
W. H. Howard and W. Reynolds, but
chiefly on the first two. When these for
any reason failed to "come off" the whole
side has collapsed and fallen an easy vic
tim to its opponents. Two more series' of
matchesâ one in September and the other
in Octoberâ remain to be played; but it is
hardly likely, that the relative positions
of the clubs will be changed.
To-morrow being an open date on the
schedule of the California Cricket Asso
ciation, efforts were made to get up a
match between Young America and Great
Britain and her colonies, but were not
successful. The older players, after tak
ing part in three matches during the
month, are not sorry to have a respite on
the fourth Sunday. â¢
Preparations for the visit to T.ake Coun
ty are going on apace, and there is every
likelihood that the three local clubs will
send a strong team to play against the
cricketers of Burns Valley and LakepOrt.
John Myers of the Pacifies will take his
vacation in Lake County and will Join
the team there. ..
As it is the policy of the Commissioners
of Golden Gate Park to render the park
as attractive as possible to the people and
to offer facilities for sports of all kinds,
It is not unlikely that arrangements may
be made, to play the matches against the
Santa Cruz Country Club there. Many
hundreds of San Francisco residents had
never seen a game of polo until the Bur
llnpame men played in the park, and the
same may be said of cricket. In the park
cricket can be played on real green turf,
as it should -be played, and not on con
crete and matting, as it is necessary to
do at Alameda. Though there is no great
likelihood that the San Francisco youth
would abandon baseball for cricket, many
of the elders . at any rate would be -glad
to see cricket played in a spot convenient
of access and of picturesque surroundings.

The agreement which resulted In an al
ternate operation by the two associations
was voluntarily and \ deliberately broken
by Union Park. . It was not a contract
agreement, so the - moving factor in the

forming the other party. Â¦.
The Futurity stake, which will be run
during the Admission . day celebration,
promises to be the largest and most In
teresting stake of its kind : ever held in
America. This will be the next big cours
ing card, and the eyes of the leashmen are
all directed toward it.
' This week's stake at, Union Park Is ex
ceptional ' from . the Â¦ point of quality. The
card last Saturday and Sunday drew a
heavy crowd- on account of the tine dogs
The result of It all will be more- cours
ing. The Ingleside association will surely
operate the San Mateo park. What the
opening date will be has not yet been de
cided upon, but it will certainly be not far
off. As" the Union Park people now op
erate on Wednesday in a midweek reserve
stake they will continue that plan. The
Ingleside association will in all probability
establish a midweek event, to be run on
Thursdays. This places the game back on
Us old basisâ two midweek stakes, one at
each park, and Saturday and Sunday
stakes at both parks.
The Union Park association declares
that it has adopted the recently deter
mined line of action on the behests of the
dog owners. They claim that the expense
of training, keeping and all the other out
lays incident to the establishment of ken
nels are so great that continuous coursing
Is necessary. That the sport has devel
oped here in a remarkable manner there
can be no doubt. On the score of the sup
ply of dogs there will be no difficulty ex
perienced by either park, for there Is a
greater number than Is needed to go
round. - , Â¦Â¦-Â¦â¢ - * ,. Â¦ . Â¦ " ,.
The split between the two coursing as

TOMMY RYAN, MOLDER OF CHAMPION FIGHTERS.
Mrs. Tt. G. Brown of the San Rafael
Golf Club has been playing in excellent
form lately. Not only did she win the
Scott Cup for ladles In the recent tourna
ment at Del Monte, but her team of six
ladies proved victorious In the series of
three matches which were recently con
cluded on the San Rafael links. Her team
included three winners. In the men's
team matches George Heazelton"9 team
of eleven won the series with seven win
ners. Eacji member of the winning
teams received a trophy, a pewter cup
or rau? suitably Inscribed.
There will be a great deal of golf at
San Rafael during the first two weeks
of September. The qualifying rounds for
the Council's Cup for men and for the
Ladies' Cup will be played on Septem
ber 3, prizes being offered for the best
gross and the best net score. The eight
lowest scores among the men and the
women will In each case enter the com
petition for the cups. The first round of
the cud contest will be played on the.
afternoon of Saturday, September 8, the
seml-flnal round on September 9 and
the final round on the following day.
Next year the management of thÂ»
Hotel del Monte will have the services of
a committee consisting of one member
from each golf club around San Fran
cisco, to which any question arising out
of the golf tournament may be referred.
This year golf matters had to be referred
to the general committee in charge of
the carnival, which was made up of lov
ers of polo and horse racing. Both E. R.
Folger of the Oakland Golf Club and E.
J McCutchen of the San Francisco and
Saji Rafael clubs' were playing very
strongly at Del Monte. The former
would probably have given John Law
son a close game had they met. The lat
ter stands an excellent chance of winning
the Council's CurÂ» at San Rafael next
month. As K. J. McCutchen has already
won the trophy twice, it will become his
permanent possession if he succeeds in
winning it a third time.- Consequently
an unusual degree of Interest "attaches
to this competition for the trophy.
The eight who qualified In the recent
contest for the championship of the
Santa Monica Golf Club were the follow
ing: F. H. Edwards. Winsor Walton.
K D Oshorn. N. F. Wilshire. S. C.

place to-morrow and will be attended by
an unusually large number of yachts

a delegation of disconsolate members of
the San Francisco Yacht Club will bÂ«
present for the purpose of officially turn-
Ing over the Perpetual Challenge cup to
the winners. As tbe trophy is deposited
out of eight ur.tll it is claimed by some
other club. It has been thought well ta
present some memorial of the victory to
the owners of the winning yacht. A neat

An interesting race will take place to
morrow between the sloops Thelma, Pac

take third and fourth places in the races
will provide a French dinner for all con

The trophy committee of the Pacific In
terclub Yacht Association met last Tues
day and selected thirteen cups to be
awarded in the seven classes, from Si
footers to 29-footers. at the annual regatta
talcing place September 11. Two cups will
be awarded in each of the seven classes,
the first prize in the 30-foot class being
the fifth Macdonough cup. The cups are
of silver and are now on exhibition in
the windows of a downtown jewelry
store. The committee also selected a de
sign for the Macdonoush cup of 19jO. The
cup will be 17 inches high, made of ham
mered silver, standing on an ebony base
in inches in height. The cup will have
two handles and round the base will be
the flaps of the five yacht clubs, enameled
in colors on silver. As a $2oO cup seems an
unnecessarily valuable trophy to offer in
a single race, it is probable that Mr. Mac
donough will give the next series of cups
on different conditions. Probably two
prizes at least will be given in future. Of
the four Macdonough cups already award

the Government training school. At about
11 o'clock the Edna ar.o. Emma sailed out
toward the Heads, the other yachts
going: up the bay. Between Points Lobos

FOR many years has Tommy Ryan,
now in this city training for his
fight with Jack Moffatt, held the
stage as the cleverest welter or

twelve years since his initial public fistic

business. As a boxer he is accredited the
cleverest of them all, save perhaps Jim
Corbett, whose skill is a byword to ring
patrons and the mixers Inside the ropes.
But Tommy Ryan has blossomed into an
other kind of fistic wonder. Though a
fighter yet, he Is to-day the greatest ex

Ryan's biggest success has been with the

calmly and with a great deal of conft

and tries the floor. Fitzslmmons remains
standing up and they have taken his
chair away. He don't seem to care for it.
Here he comes over to talk to me. He
says: "I got my whack before I went j
on." That shows that Fltz Is a wise man.
He Is a good financier as well as a great
fighter. Tom Sharkey remains sitting
down and Tom O'Rourke is sponging and i
rubbing him down with a towel and giv- j
ing him a lemon to suck. Sharkey is
bothered a little with- a cold In the r*ad.
Here comes Charley White into the ring.

Sliarkey's Momentary Triumph. .
Round 1â Sharkey dushed at Fitz with a !
left hook in chest and caught him. sending j
the old man back against the ropes.
Sharkey is doing the rushing. He seems J
rather heavy on his feet, l'ltz is feeling
him out quietly and Sharkey dashes in
again with a right for the ribs, but misses
by a foot as Fitz breaks ground. Fitz Is
taking his time with him. Sharkey dashes
in. Fitz swings for the neck, but misses,
as Sharkey ducks. Sharkey rushes in
again and Fitz catchf3 him with a left
hcok on the right eye. Sharkey comes
back at him, swinging both hands for the
head and catches Fitz on the nose with a
left swing. Fitz* swings his left and
Sharkey ducks under it. and Fitz looks a
bit anxious. No, he is laughing now as he
twice blocks Sharkey's left swings for the
body with ease. Fitz misses a terrible Jfeft
swing. Sharkey swings Loth hands for
the jaw. Eharkey lands a wild left swing
en the jaw and sends Fitz down back
ward and falls down t>ver him. The bell
xlngs while Fiiz is down and nobody
seems to hear it but Fitz's seconds, who
rush In and drag him to the corner. He
looks tired, but after a few seconds' rest
looks as well as ever. It was a Holy ter
rorâthat left swing to the nose.
Round 2â Sharkey rushes, but Fitz
steps away and misses right swing for
the face by being too short. Sharkey
rushes in wildly and backs Fitz against
the ropes, but the old man clinches a:ul

i straight right jab that splits Tom's lip.
Fitz sends a bluff left for the head and
catches Sharkey in the belly with the
right. Sharkey misses a left for the head,
but sends in a right on tyxa body. It's a.
hard blow and shakes up Fitz badly

hook on the jaw that shakes him up. He
rushes in again and Fitz puts in a left
and right hook on the jaw and senu-s

After the Battle.
Here's a funny thing. The moment Fitz
is declared winner he comes over here to
shake hands with c=&
"Well, Fitz, old boy, I congratulate you.
Now Fitz goes back to his corner. He's
a wonderful old man and the best man of
all of them that I have met. I like Fitz,
and I'm perfectly willing to fight him
within six months before any club in the
country offering the greatest amount of
money.
Sharkey seemed very slow to-night and
did not appear to be right. He used pooi
judgment in rushing in at Fitz wide open
and not protecting himself properly. Eut
even at his beat Fitz could lick him. I
They ought not to be, because I under
stand there had been some trouble about
the money and Fitz Is not to be blamed.
Fitz doesn't pay any attention to the hoot
ing, groaning and hissing. He looks bright
and good. Now he takes his bath robe off
and all the hissing and hooting turns to
cheers and applause. Fitzslmmons looks
very good, very bright. His eyes are clear
and he seems very confident. I think he
weights about 170 pounds.
Fitz's hands are thoroughly bandaged,

structions. There is one advantage Fitz
has over the sailor: he doesn't need
any instructions from anybody when he
gets into the ring. He is the coolest, shift
iest fighter that. ever got inside the rope3
and he has the hardest punch of the whole
lot. I look for a first-rate fight, and if
Sharkey's side is all right again I expect
to see him make a splendid showing, al

Special Dlssatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Auc 24.â Here Is Shar
key, first in the ring at 10:40
o'clock. He has an elegant new
bath robe on. You would think
he spends all his money for bath
robes. There he goes over to ray corner,
thevnortheast corner. Now, Tom has his
robe off and we can get a good look at
him. He looks first rate. I don't think
any man could wish to be in better con
dition. He isn't a bit drawn and his mus
cles look a little bit loose, almost flabby.
He isn't flabby, though. He is simply

They had been paid off and money was no
object. The fun grew so fast and furious
that Policemen Helnf and Geiman went
up to suppress it. When they arrested
Smith as ringleader the entire mob
charged, and one of the keepers of tha
peace drew his pistol and tired it in the
air before the crowd would give way.

Sergeant Donovan with a squad of twenty
policemen left the California-street police
station for the battle-ground. Here they
were joined by the Chinatown patrol an<l
thirty arrests were made. "Counting
noses." it was found that no injuries ha>i
been sustained by the "cops." which was
a matter for congratulation, as the battle
at one time assumed the appearar.ee of
a lively skirmish.
Sergeant Donovan attributes the ab
sence of serious hurts to the fact that the
soldiers carried no side arms. Had *ueb.
been the case a disastrous result might
have been recorded. The sergeant ha3
given orders to arrest any soldier showing
signs of intoxication anrt the original

ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 24. â The handsome
medal offered by the regatta committee
for the Pacific Coast championship Bingle
shell race will to-morrow adorn the breast
cf Alexander Pape, the husky San Fran
cisco oarsman. He is well entitled to the
trophy, for the championship race was
the hardest he ever participated in. ' The
result was in doubt until tire last mo
ment, but I'ape's wonderful endurance
iinally told and he linlshed first. His
formidable competitor was Gloss of Port
land.
The championship was the main event
of the day. There were four entriesâ Pape
and Stcrnberg of San Francisco and Gloss
and Patton of Portland.
The men got an excellent start. Gloss
and Pape having the inside of the course.
They started out side by side and their
boats fairly flew over the water. Stern
berg and Patton had the outside of the
course and were together most of the way.
Pape and Gloss rounded the buoy about
the same time and came into the stretch
neck and neck. Pape pulled a strong
stroke, but with surprising tenacity Glosa
clung to the shell of the sturdy Callfor
nlan. Gradually Pape's shell forged
ahead. The Californlan's strength was
telling against the Portlander, who fal
tered toward the end. Pape finished half
a length ahead. Time. 11:39. Pape warmly
congratulated the Portland lad and ad
mitted that he had had the warmest race
of his life.

ered, be prosecuted.
Hackett's affidavit sets forth that In
March last he wrote to Johnston asking
him if he would row him for a purse.
Johnston's reply was a suggestion that
Hackett come to Vancouver and row a
race for an alleged stake and allow Johns
ton to defeat him. Several, letters were
written by Johnston subsequently re
garding the same proposed fake race,
Johnston stating that a saloonkeeper, W.
11. Quann, would provide the stake money
and that all' the money won by Quann in
betting on Johnston to win would bo di
vided equally between Quann, Johnston
and Hackett. Hackett agreed to Johns
ton's proposition and on arriving: In Van
couver was given $200 by Quann to bet on
himself In public places as a blind. Quann
also sent to him $1000 by his brother and
J. McLean, a bartender, to hand back to
Quann publicly as Hackett's stake money.
After the race $270 was haoded to Hack
ett as his share of the money won by
Quann's bets on Johnston. J. McLean fig
ured in the transaction as a go-between,
meeting Hackott in Seattle and arrang

and saloon men and furnished the money
for the carrying out or the scheme. Sworn
evidence was taken this afternoon at a

Hackett made a sensational affidavit, an
outline of which Is glv*n below, every.de

"FAKE" RULES
THE REFEREE IN
A BOATRACE
At thÂ«Â» close of the round Sharkey, with
a terrific swing that landed on the shoul
der ana neck, put Fitzsimmons to the
floor of the rir.g and Tom fell over him
in his mad rush. Tom regained his feet
quickly, but the bell rang with Fitzsim
mons still on the floor. The spectators
wrre cheering like wild men, and when
Kitz.=immons got to his feet the men
Fhaped up to go for each other, evidently
not having heard the be'.l amid the up
roar. The referee rushed between them,
sending them to their corners, and this
is where Sharkey says he would have
finished Fitz5immons had he had ten sec
ond*? more.
Jn the cecond round Sharkey. having
grained confidence from knocking Fitz
simmons down in the preceding round,
went for his man as if to annihilate him.
but Fitzsimmon?. having the cooler head
and better judgment, outgeneraled the
younger man. Â¦who seemed to lose all con
trol of himself in his frantic endeavors
to land on Fitzslmmons. Then Fitzsim
mons stepped in with a crushing right
to the body and a ready left to the Jaw,
â¢while the best Sharkey could do was to
swing a left which landed in the middle
of Fitzsimmons' back.
The Sailor's Finish.
There was fearful force behind this
blow, as Fitzsimmons said after the fight
was over that he felt as if he had been
hit with a pickax in the small of the
back. Fitzsimmons' coolness never for-
Foofc him and he watched Sharkey's wild
efforts with evident satisfaction, as the
pallor was leaving himself very open.
Kitzslmmons stepped In to him and liter
ally battered Sharkey down with rights
on the body and lefts and rights on the
head. Eharkey took the count and came
up groggy. He staggered back to the
ropes, with Fitzslmmons hot after him.
Sharkey was then unable to protect him
self and Fitzsimmons sent that fearful
right once more to the body, following it
Fitz Goes Down.
NETC YORK. Aug. 24.â "Whipped
into insensibility in less than two
rounds." is the story In brief of
Tom Sharkey's meeting with Bob
Fitzsimmons at the Coney Island
Sporting Club to-night. Fitzsimmons was
the victor, Sharkey the loser. Fltzslm
ir.cns said all along that when an oppor
tunity presented Itself he would prove
conclusively that he was Sharkey's su
perior and settle accounts for the Injus
tice done him when he met Sharkey in
California four years ago. Sharkey was
equally confident that he would prove to
1->e Fitzsimmcns' master In the ring, but
the result of to-nlghfs battle and the
brevity of it proved that Fitzsimmons is
etlll a great fighter and able to beat the
best of the heavyweights. He has beaten
Corbett, Ruhlln and Sharkey.
Fitzslmmons was a decided favorite in
the bettir.g, owing to his showing with
Ruhlin a short time ago. His defeat of
Ruhlin on that occasion, and the previ
ous victory of Ruhlin over Sharkey a few
â¢weeks earlier, were figured on as show
ing that FltZFimmons ought to whip the
e&Uqj at this meeting.
Sharkey's Wild Blows.
When the men met to-night both of
them declared themselves to be in flrst
c!aÂ£s condition, and they certainly looked
it. Fitzsimmons had taken on a few
pounds in weight since his meeting with
Jluhlln. but neither he nor Sharkey would
tell his actual weight. Sharkey looked
to be cbout twenty pounds the heavier.
When the men came together Sharkey
assumed the aggressive, rushing flercely
and swinging wiMly. Fitzslmmons had
r.o difficulty in sidestepping out of the
way. Bob soon began feinting Sharkey
Into leads, and when the sailor tried his
round-arm blows he left himself open,
of which fact Fitzsimmons was quick to
lake advantage, and he stepped inside and
put powerful right and left smashes on
the sailor's body and neck. He stabbed
Sharkey with his left, making the
tailor lose temper. Then Sharkey
rushed more wildly than before, missing
moft of the swingrs, while Fitzsimmons
wos getting to him with great force and
using both hands.
When Fitzslmmons was declared the
winner the crowd surged toward the ring,
but the police drove them back. Fitzsim
mons was congratulated by those nearest
his coiner, and then he ran over and
grasped Sharkey by the gloved hands
Htzsimmons almost danced with delight
when stepping back from Sharkey's cor
r.er. and as iie walked to his dressing
toom he was loudly cheered. Sharkey in
the meantime had recovered very quickly
from his pur.i-hment and was able to
leave the ring us soon as Fitzsimmons.
Sharkey had a black eye and a bloody
nose as the result of his meeting with
Fitzsimmons, who beat him down as if he
had been using a big hammer In a black
smith's forge.
"Well, I got licked sure enough, but I've
got myself to blame for it. I should not
have mixed It up. That is where I made
the mistake. I wish the opening round had
lasted about fifteen seconds longer and I
would have finished him, as I am sure I
had him going when the bell separated
us."
In an adjoining room Sharkey was being
rubbed down by his handlers. lie seemed
to be crestfallen at his defeat. He said:
"I've got very little to say, other than
I'm glad I won and won quickly. I am
glad also for the sake of my wife and chil
dren, and am going to hurry home to them
with all possible speed. I will look for
Jeffries next, and will be ready to meet

After the battle, when the men had re
turned to their dressing-rooms, it was seen
that Fitzsimmons did not show a mark.
He had a slight cut on the Inside of hi3
lip, that was all. Fitzslmmons said:
Then there was another delay of nearly
an hour before the big fellows made their
appearance. Charley White, the chosen
referee, refused to officiate until $500 was
guaranteed to him. When White was
granted his point It was thought that the
fight would go on, but Fitzslmmons and
his manager insisted that the amount of
the purse, $25,000, should be in sight before
the lanky pugilist would enter the ring.
Just what amount was come to between the
club manager and Fitzslmmons could not
be learned, but Fitzslmmons declared that
he was satisfied as he walked to the ring
side. Sharkey had been in the ring fully
twenty-five minutes before Fitzsimmons
turned up and Bob was received with min
gled cheers and groans, as the great ma
jority of the those present were not aware
of what had delayed him. In less than
fifteen minutes afterward those who
groaned at the old man were standing on
chairs and benches cheering madly for the
man who had given Sharkey his quietus.
Fitzsimmons Unharmed.
About 6000 people saw the bout, but if
they had not been extra good-natured
they would have left the clubhouse before
the fight was put on. The club manage
ment was in bad odor for forty-five min
utes, during which 6000 penned-up sports
sweltered and fumed in the hot clubhouse,
where there was little or no ventilation.
The preliminary bout fell through and an
other had to be substituted, which caused
a delay of at least an hour' and a half.
When the boys began fighting it was seen
that they knew nothing of the game, and
their work In the ring was so ridiculous
that the on-lookers took It as a huge Joke,
instead of resenting it as a gold brick
which was offered them.
Preliminaries a Farce.

LJNDER the title, "The New Nullification." Sen
] ator Chandler has written to the New York Sun
a letter pointing out the grave problems
which have arisen out of the action of so many of
the Southern States in virtually disfranchising the
negro. He very justly says: "Among all the other
questions which are agitating the people in the pend
ing canvass, thoughtful and patriotic men in the North
and the South alike may wisely give some reflec
tion to the question suggested by the recent North
Carolina election, where the result has been falsified
and changed by mob violence, and where freedom
of speech lias been so far suppressed that a United
States Senator supporting Bryan for President i;
threatened with death if he continues to speak against
the nullification of the fifteenth amendment of the
United States constitution."
Senator Chandler has no plan to offer for dealing
with the wrong. He says: "The problem I have
stated I cannot solve even satisfactorily to myself.
The country is in a cul de sac and cannot directly
get out or turn about." He points out that a revival
of sectionalism in our politics is to be avoided if that
can be effected without a sacrifice of the constitution
itself, but sees no, way of achieving it unless the
Southern leaders themselves perceive the folly of their
course and take steps to do justice to the negro. Un
der the circumstances ail that the Senator seeks is to
arouse the attention of the nation to the evil of the sit
uation and provoke upon it a discussion which may
brij;g to light some adequate means of grappling with
the wrong.
The one hope of conservative men in this quandary
is that the Supreme Court may declare the "grand
father clause" in the North Carolina constitution in
valid That point has not yet been raised before the
court and it is by no means certain that it will stan.1
the teÂ«t. Should the clause be set aside the 'North
Carolina constitution will exclude illiterate whites
from the franchise as well as illiterate blacks and in
that case it is probable the whites would themselves
repeal the famous amendment and restore the fran
chise as it was.
The course the Republican party will take on th*
subject will, of course, be determined by the develop
ments that take place later on. It is impossible
at present to forecast what that policy will be. further
than to say it will uphold Republican traditions with
respect to rights of all citizens whether white or black.
In the meantime, as Senator Chandler says:
The present fluty of Republicans Is to elect McKinley
Â»nd Roosevelt > by enormous popular majorities tn the
Northern. Middle an*! Western States and by a sufficient
majority in the electoral colleges: and alr.o to carry the
House Republican. If we can, against the forty extra

lation, whom we cannot hope to elect because the colored
votes are not free and are of no force and effect at the

IN one of the local galleries this week,
whoro a number of new pictures have
been hung, a noticeable preponderance
of animal subjects is apparent, and
there are one or two really good things
among them.
Edmond A. Osthaus. whose dog pictures
have made him famous, exhibits a subject
that will interest all sportsmen and lovers
of the "friend of man." A couple of set
ters, Irish .and Llewellyn, and a pointer,
posed In its characteristic attitude, are
about to enter the brush where lies the
victim of their master's skill. The alert
poise, effect of moYement and sympathetic
handling of the subject, the color,
draughtsmanship and composition, will
delight alike artist and sportsman. The
picture has been excellently reproduced,
photographically.
Another animal subject by a Scotch ar
tist, Wright Barker, is also interesting.
"A Glimpse of the Highlands' shows a
trio of the shaggy, thickset mountain
"cattle," against a background of wild
hills, half hidden by the Highland mists.
Blown heather and scant grass make the
foreground, and the strong rich color of
the wild-eyed "beasties" against it is al
most too daring. The picture lacks some
what in tone atmosphere, but it is a
worthy composition. Â¦
Jane Van Kssen contributes a sketch of

ART AND ARTISTS.
JUDGE BREGY of Pennsylvania in recently
discharging a grand jury made an address
which has revived in that State the frequently
mooted question*of reforming the methods of grand
jury procedure or abolishing the institution alto
gether. In reviewing the address the Philadelphia
Public Ledger says:
Judge Bregy, as he says, has formed his opinions of
the grand jury from a long and intimate connection
with criminal courts, and his experience has led to the
belief, in which the majority of his fellow citizens will no
doubt concur, that the system Is unwieldy and defective.
He is emphatic In his disapproval of the secrecy which
prevails in the grand jury room, where untruthful wit
nesses may give free rein to their mendacity or malice
without "direct responsibility for their words," where
corruption may gain a foothold, and where the only
thing accomplished by the grand jury's Intervention is
that "an additional chance Is offered the criminal to es
cape." Judge Bregy would certainly abolish secrecy,
and would gravely consider the question of wiping the
grand jury out of existence as unnecessary, expensive
and an obstacle to Justice.
In the public discussion which lias followed a wide
difference of opinion concerning the issue has been
developed. George S. Graham of Philadelphia, a
former District Attorney, is quoted as declaring in
favor of eliminating secrecy from the proceedings of
grand juries, but adding:
I would not be in. favor, however-, of the abolishment
of the grand Jury. While I would take away from it
all its power over criminal cases and make it unneces
sary to present any indictment to it. I would not abolish
it. There are other purposes for which the grand jury
exists and ought to exist. Part of its duty is to visit all
public institutions and examine into the manner in which
they are conducted and report upon them to the court.
This includes the prisons where the criminals are con
fined. I know of no better method than this for keeping
a check upon maladministration of trust in institutions
such as I have spoken of.
Another authority, Thomas R. Elcock. who. has had
experience on the bench, is opposed to any change at
all in the system. He says:
The secrecy of the grand jury I regard as one of its
Important powers; it is to protect the innocent from the
abuse, grown so prevalent, of the public exposure of
every charge against a man, and is to protect him from
the unfounded suspicion with which a public and open
investigation of an unfounded charge would slur a man's
character. Let well enough alone, and unless an abso
lute necessity exists for a change, mere speculation upon
such a subject is dangerous.
'One of the strongest advocates for the abolition
of the system is D. Clarence Gibboney, secretary of
the Law and Order Society of Pennsylvania, who
says :
The great Injustice done by grand juries in many cases
can scarcely be conceived. It is possible for cases of the
greatest public or private importance to be completely
smothered in the grand jury room, and those engaged
In the prosecutions are left helpless. Frequently cases
are Ignored on the strongest and best of testimony, and
indictments found in other less important cases on the
same kind of testimony. Politics and inlluences.of other
kinds have been known to figure very largely in the ac
tion of grand juries. While I have rarely had trouble in
securing indictments against violators of the law, yet in
some important cases grand juries have aided notorious
violators of the. law, much to the detriment of the public
Interests.
That evils exist in the grand jury system is beyond
question. In San Francisco we have had jury after
jury making final reports consisting mainly of ex
cuses for inefficiency. Sometimes the blame is placed
in one quarter, sometimes in another, but always
something is put forward as an explanation of the
| failure of the grand jury to check notorious evils.
; Thus on both sides and all over the continent it has
become a debatable question whether grand juries
: any longer serve a useful purpose to the community.
That fact in itself proves there is need of reform some
where and now that the Pennsylvanians have the issue
before them it is to be hoped they will not turn aside
from it until some remedy has been found that will
lead to reforms in the system in all the States.

e SECOND 0CCEPT0NCE.
COLONEL BRYAN may put this down as his
busy month. His present occupation is the ac
ceptance of Presidential nominations. He has
already taken in two, made under the main tent, and
one by a sideshow called "the American Monetary
League."
In accepting the Populist nomination at Topeka he
took occasion to commit himself to another issue of
greenbacks and to pat on the shoulder all the declara
tions of the Populist platform. He limped a little in
his speech when he came to the improved industrial
condition of the country, which he attributed to an
increase in the volume of the circulating medium. If
he would look a little further he would discover that
the increase is in the circulation of good, full value
dollars, each redeemable in gold at 100 cents, and not
in the 45-cent dollars of silver, which he advocated
in 1806, nor in the irredeemable paper greenback
which he advocates new. He says much about put
ting the dollar above the man. But the Republican
party has made it a 100-cent dollar and does not hang
it too high for the man to get it, while he proposes
to make it a 45-cent dollar under conditions that
will probably put it out of the man's reach, as all kinds
of dollars were before the gold standard was assured
by his defeat four years ago.
After accepting the full round of financial vagaries
dear to the Populist heart, he attacked imperialism in
this way: "Already the more advanced supporters of
the colonial idea point to the economy of a system of
government which intrusts all the powers to the
Executive and does ."way with the necessity of legis
lation. The Army ard Navy Journal in its issue of
August 4 commends the English system and declares,
as a result of this system, a fifth of the world's' area
and one-fifth of its population is ruled with an ad
ministrative economy which is an administrative mar
vel. Thus does imperialism bear its supporters back
ward, turning toward the dark ages."
We beg Colonel Bryan's pardon. That commenda
tion of England's policy and turning toward the dark
ages did not originate with the Army and Navy
Journal, nor the Republican party. In 1898 Mr.
Hearst, his principal newspaper supporter and presi
dent of his National Association of Clubs, said in th:
San Francisco Examiner: "Let us examine the adjec
tives. "Monarchical hazards' â the most remarkable,
example in the history of the world of the assumption
of such hazards is furnished by England, and in faith
England has prospered indifferently well under all
that load of monarchical hazards. The fact is that
England's institutions are as free and democratic as
our own; the fact is that the English nation is^he
most powerful and most enlightened in the Old
World. 'i And again in August. 1898, Hearst said:
"In government we are the heirs of the English, who
have succeeded in governing dependencies, and if we
can't form a policy of our own we can borrow one."
Colonel Bryan at Topeka. speaking of the army nec
c?sary to hold the Philippines, said: "If 100,000 men
are withdrawn from the ranks of the producers and
placed as a burden on the backs of those who remain,
it must be longer hours, harder work and greater
sacrifices for tho=e who toil."
But on August 9. J& r j8, his supporter and club presi
dent, Mr. Hearst, provided for that difficulty. He
said in the Examiner: "We will hold the Philippines
with an army, the cost of which will be paid out of the
island revenues, on which it will be a proper charge."
As is his habit. Colonel Bryan quoted Lincoln, as
saying of the principles of Jefferson and his axioms
of free society: "And yet they are denied and evaded
with no small show of success. One dashingly calls
them 'glittering generalities' and another bluntly
calls them 'self-evident lies.' And others insidiously
argue that they apply only to superior races. Those
expressions, differing in form, are identical in object
and effect â the supplanting of the principles of free
government and restoring those of classification, caste
and legitimacy."
Very true. But Mr. Hearst said in 1898: "We are
under no obligation to give equal citizenship to the
inferior races and natives of these islands," and the
principles of Jefferson have been successfully evaded
in the South, where Colonel Bryan expects 120 elec
toral votes, by the complete disfranchisement and
degradation of the negro.
When the blacks down there attempted to use the
equality in which Lincoln believed and the ballot
given them by the Federal constitution. Senator Till
man said: "We shot them. We stuffed ballot boxes.
We used fraud and tissue ballots.'*
We beg to suggest to Colonel Bryan that he go
South and quote Lincoln and do missionary work
among his own supporters in behalf of the Govern
ment by consent, which has been taken from our fel
low citizens, who outnumber all the millions of the
Spanish islands. Â¦
the nation, its press end its Government is distinctly
symptomatic of moral decay. Self-deception is the
first sign by which the malady is diagnosed. Colonel
Stoffel, in his famous volume of reports from Berlin
in which before the great catastrophe of 1870 he sets
forth the strength of Prussia and the weakness of
France, places his finger upon precisely the same
habit of self-deception as the most fatal feature in
France."
By way of specific instances of weakness the writer
says: "Never before in our military history have
such incidents happened as that at Sanna's Post, 'when
1200 enemies routed or captured 2000 British troops;
or Spion Kop, where 800 Boers drove ignominiously
back 20,000 British fighting men under the best of
our War Office generals." He attributes the disas
ters to the lack of military training on the part of
British officers, and intimates that in the presence of
a foe of anything like equal strength the army would
go to pieces from the lack of intelligent leadership.
The navy is declared to be about as badly managed
as the army. Thus it is said: "At this actual moment
the French have at Cherbourg and Brest no less than
eighteen battleships and fourteen cruisers, all mod
ern or modernized throughout. Britain has at this
moment twenty-five battleships and twenty-three
cruisers in commission in home waters, but when we
look into the catalogue of our battleships the greatest
misgivings are felt. Not only are fifteen of the
twenty-five of antiquated design, too often with old
boilers and a great amount of inflammable wood in
their hulls, but actually four of our vessels carry the
muzzle-loader a3 a part â if not the main part â of their
armor."
These statements are certainly weighty enough to
give rise to serious apprehension on the part 61- re
flecting Britons, for the danger of a great war is cer
tainly too imminent to be disputed. Well may the
National Review in forecasting the future exclaim,
"Oh, for one hour of the mighty Cromwell!"

â¢ The Supreme Court has under consideration the
very interesting question whether or not a man can
be killed by bad whisky. Perhaps it might be asking
the learned Justices too much to sample some of the
brands sold on Market street.
The "lady" smuggler who skirted herself with duti

It is stated that by this census the population of

Jobbery has become so frequent and notorious in
the School Department that it might not be unwise
for the Board of Education to do something decent

The people of Omaha ought to be interested in that

WIT OF THE INDIAN.
There was a lawyer in the Indian coun
try who had none too good a reputation
for honesty. One of the aborigines em
ployed him to do a little lesral business.
It was done to the client's satisfaction, the
fee duly paid and a receipt for it duly de
manded.
"A receipt isn't necessary," the lawyer
said.
"But I want it," replied the red man.
There was some argument, and the attor
ney finally demanded his reason.
"Since becoming a Christian I have been
very careful in all my dealings, that I
may be ready for the judgment," an
swered the bravo sententiously, "and
when th'at day tomes I don't want to take
time to gxÂ» to the bad place to get my re
ceipt from you."
The receipt was made out and delivered
promptly.â Philadelphia Call.
BRITISH ALARMISTS.
rOR many a year past fears of an invasion have
been common among certain classes of the Brit
ish people. These fears have been made use of
at every good opportunity by politicians desirous o!
rousing up opposition to the Ministry in power at
the time. There has probably never been a Prime
Minister in Great Britain since the Napoleonic wars
who has not been charged by his opponents with sur
rendering British interests abroad and leaving the
island itself exposed to foreign invasion*. Such at
tacks, however, have been intended mainly for cam
paign uses. When the men who have made them get
into power they go on in the old way, and it is then
the turn of their opponents to use the alarm argu
ment and denounce them for neglecting the safety and
preservation of the empire.
It is expected there will be a dissolution of Parlia
ment within a short time, and a general election in the
fall. That gives a stimulus to the alarmists, and ac
cordingly the British press is teeming with warning?
of all sorts of disaster likely to befall the country un
less the Government provide a more adequate means
of offense and defense. Most of the alarmists are
hardly of much more importance than the calamity
howler in the United States, but now and then one of
them supports his assertions of danger by arguments
so well founded and by reasons of such serious im
port they are deserving of careful study. Such men
prove there are genuine weaknesses in Britain's mili
tary and naval armament, and that a war with a strong
and resolute foe might actually end in a descent upon
England and the capture of London.

Conrad's insanity was due to the fact
that playmates had mÂ»de him believe
that he was accused of setting fire to a
barn at Fresno, the flre causing the
death of forty horses. Conrad cut his
throat with suicidal intent shortly after

SAN JOSE, Aug. 24.â Senator Charles M.
Rhortrldge Its llnancially embarrassed, and
to-day his paper, the Evening Herald,
was taken possession of by creditors. For
several months the paper has been hav
ing a hard time meeting its bills. The
employes have not been paid regularly,
and the young lady compositors have been
on the verge of striking several times.
Besides, San Jose Typographical Union
has been pressing Shortridge to 'unionize
his paper.
W. E. Croesman of the real estate firm
of Crossman & Orvis, is now in possession
of the paper, representing many of the
large creditors. He refused to say how
much the Herald was Involved, bu,t those
who claim to know say the total indebt
edness of the paper will foot up nearly
$20,000. This is about all it would bring
under forced pale. The Senator purchased
the paper a little over a year ago for $30,
000. Ten thousand dollars of the money
he paid H. H. Main for the Herald he se
cured from a local bank on a note for that
amount Indorsed by J. H. Henry. Jona
than Sweigert and W. E. Crossman. and
it is the pressing demand by the First
National Bank on the Senator for this
money that has forced the paper Into
Mr. Crossman's hands. A short time ago
a chattel mortgage on the Herald plant
went on record for the First National
Bank for $2000, and another in favor of J.
H. Henry, W. E. Crossman and Jonathan
Sweigert for $S000. During the past month
several small attachments have been
levied against the paper, but after short
duration were raised.
\V. E. Crossman will now run the Her
ald in the Interests of the creditors until
the paper can be sold, and will be repre
sented in the business management of the
paper by Roy Norton. There will be no
change made In the Herald, which Is Re
publican, while it remains In Mr. Cross
man's hands. A company of Democrats
is now paid to be figuring on its purchase.

CHAPTER I.
Y AKEPORT. Aug. 24.â Away back In
i , the musty past one of "Doc"
j Thomas D. Gardiner's ancestors
{ j was bitten by a dog. What the
nature of the provocation was the
family chronicler docs not record, but the
occurrence marked a new epoch in the
Gardiner history. Since then, through
generation after generation, descendants
of the luckless ancient have waged re
lentless warfare against all the canine
tribe.
Years ago "Doc" Gardiner hung up a
gilded tooth in front of his newly openei
dental parlors here. His advent brought
the feud to Lakeport and the dogs of thia
inland metropolis knew no peace. When
he journeyed down the streets by day
four-footed friends of man scattered like
picnic rioters before a squad of bluecoats.
Oft in the stilly night a plaintive ki-yl
gave evidence that some luckless cur had
been taken unawares.
CHAPTER n.
In his room at one of Lakeport's lead
ing hotels, "Doc" Gardiner kept a store
of large firecrackers. When the bark of
a dog was heard he arose from his coucn,
raised a window and threw out one of
the explosives. It mattered not that the
detonation caused every cur in the town
to join In the midnight chorus. "Doc"
I^akeport, smarting under the memory of
countless wrongs, had gathered to assert
their rights. As "Doc" Gardiner's fire
crackers fell among them they struggled
and fought, as though each sought to be
the first to seize the dangerous bombs
and rend them asunder.
"Wall, if I don't swan to goodness if
them curs ain't screnadin' the 'Doc' good
and plenty!" exclaimed one old-timer.
"It do beat all I ever seen afore," com
mented another.
For two hours the battle raged. Then
the bombardment from the Gardiner win
dow ceased. The "Doc's" ammunition waÂ«
exhausted. Throughout the small hours
the canine chorus made night hideous in
Lakeport.
CHAPTER IV.
"With the coming of dawn Lakeporfs
population hastened to the scene of the
disturbance to investigate, and when the
first rays of light crept over the eastern
hills the mystery was explained. The
vacant lot was alive with dogs and each
of them was tied: unexploded firecrack
ers littered the ground; a long garden
hose, attached to a nearby hydrant, lay
where It hajl been left when lack of am
munition in the room above rendered it
no longer necessary.
Suspicion points to two young men
locally notorious as practical jokers.
"Doc" Gardiner vows vengeance. While
he awaits a new supply of ammunition
from San Francisco the bowwows of
Lakeport hold nightly revel.
Gardiner true to his family traditions,
continued the bombardment until satis
fled that he had done his duty. Then he
retired to his couch and slumbered peace
fully.
Old residents of Lakeport declare that
in his younger days "Doc" Gardiner couil
hear the bark of a dog nine miles away.
CHAPTER IH.
But now there is a surcease to the woe3
of I^akeport's colony of bowwows, and
the market value of firecrackers has gone
skyward. When one night recently some
reckless canine emitted a yelp under
"Doc" Gardiner's window and there fol
lowed no explosion all I^akeport marveled.
When the yelp was succeeded by a chorus
of barks and iwhines anu howls and yet
there came no answering volley wonder
gave way to alarm.
"The 'Doc' must be putty sick," sug
gested ono late rounder.
"Perhaps he's been took with rheuma
tics." ventured a comrade. "Something
ought to he did."
There was a general exodus toward the
hotel. Five minutes later the street i'.i
front of the hostelry was filled with awe
ptruck natives. Did their eyes deceive
them? The vacant lot beneath the oid
man's window seemed in the darkness to
be crowded with snarling and yelping
curs. From the buttress above more
descended a stream of sputtering fuse*,
which wore extinguished ore they scarcely
touched the ground. To the gaping on
lookers it appeared that- all the dogs of

FRESNO. Aug. 24.â The town of Dlnuba.
In Tulare County, was swept by fire thl3
evening. As a result the four principal
business buildings of the town are in
nshes. The lnss is estimated at from
$20,000 to $25,000, only a small part of which
is covered by Insurance. 'While fighting
the flames eight persons were injured.
The fire broke out Just before 4 oVlock
In thÂ»> rear of the wooden hotel building
conducted by Miller & Doyle. It origi
nated in the explosion of a can of gaso
line In the hotel kitchen. The flames
quickly destroyed the hotel and spread to
an adjoining three-story brick structure
owned by C. J. Craycroft of this city. In
this building was situated the office of
the Long Distance Telephone Company.
The third building destroyed was a one
story brick erected only a short time ago.
From this the fire jumped to a large
building adjoining and before it could be
checked it was also burned.
The citizens of the town formed a
bucket brigade and fought the flames he
roically. A telegram asking for assistance
was sent to this city and a railroad switch
engine equipped for fighting fire was dis
patched' to help the residents of the burn
ing town. After three hours' hard work
the flames were checked.
Eight persons were injured during the
progress of the fire, four of them seri
ously. M. E. Weddle, a well-known resi
dent, attempted to earn,' a quantity of
inflammable material out of one of the
burning buildings. It exploded in his
hands and he was badly cut about the
head and arms by the flying fragments.
Others seriously cut and burned while
fighting the flames are: J. Williams, F.
M. McCaslin, and J. Kolb. The other four
were only slightly cut about the neck and
head.

FOREST PRESERVER IS
RECEIVED AND FETED
AMONG the many beautiful San
Franciscans who have scored flat
tering successc-s In the Eastern
dramatic neld, none have met with
a more- brilliant reception than Florence
Woodward, the talented young actress
who went East some time ago to become
a member of the Daly company. Mis?
Woodward has returned to fill a special
engagement with Ferris Hartman In a
big production of "Ship Ahoy," with
which the Alhambra Theater will open
Its regular season on September 6. Im
mediately upon the conclusion of this en
gagement Miss Woodward will return to
New York, whe^e sJul is permanently en
paged at the Casino.. Brief as her ap
pearance here will be. It will afford her
host of admirers a long desired opportuni
ty of -witnessing a display of that clever
ness which so captivated the theater-go
ers of the Eastern metropolis.
Miss Woodward's first appearance- in
ICew York was with Richard Mansfield In
"Cyrano de Bergerao" at Daly's Theater.
Her success was Instantaneous and tho
attention of many a New York manager
was attracted to the fascinating Califor
nian. -It. was during one of these perform
ances that George W. Lederer of the Ca
sino heard Miss -Woodward -sins and it
did not take the famous manager loniÂ»
to conclude a deal whereby he secured her
for his big production of "In GayParee"
as Louisette, in. which she continued her
flattering triumph and made such a hit
that Manager Lederer has retained her a*,
a permanent fixture with his Casino com
pany.
In "Ship Ahoy" at the Alhambra she
will'havtf splendid opportunities, and with
the acoustic properties afforded in that
theater she could not have a better
chance to show off the extreme richness
of her mezzo soprano voice.'- '
Among the illustrations are views of
villas at Burlingame and San Mateo,
scenes at the Fourth of July celebration
In Dawson City and photographs made at
the recent outing at Del Monte. An ex
cellent story by W. C. Scully, a character
study of C. P. Huntington, an article on
"Indian Basket Making," a discussion or

together with cartoons, stories and per

Agrees to Dismiss Contest to Angelia
B. Scott's Willâ Sealskin
Sacque Sold.
Executors of the will of the late Angella
R. Scott have effected a compromise with
Amanda Meily, who filed two contests to
the will, one prior and one subsequent to
Its admission to probate. Three thousand
dollars is the sum Mrs. Meily demands in
consideration of a release by her of all
claims to -a division of the estate.
C. M. Garrish. C. S. Tilton and Frank
Garcia Jr., executors of the will, filed a
petition yesterday to effect a compromise
with Mrs. Meily on the terms named.
Judge Coffey will heaf the petition next
Friday. All heirs and. devisees under de
cedent's will have signed the petition.
After the matter of the compromise had
been adjusted the executors applied to
Judge Coffey for leave to sell a sealskin
sacque, the property of the deceased. De
cedent's husband, Emerson W. Scott, ob
jected to the sale of the garment, stating
that he should be given the same that his
dead wife's clothing might not be frayed
by the living. Judge Coffey, however, de
cided that a woman's garments were use
less to a man and he confirmed the sale
of the sacque for $160.
AMANDA MEILY READY
TO EFFECT COMPROMISE
The report of Miss A- M. d'Arcy, treas
urer, showed that the society had paid
out in sick benefits $1115. That the total
expenditures amounted to $1330 CO, and
that the balance on hand was $11,232 67.
The report of the financial secretary.
Miss Nellie Haswell, showed $.1873 40 to be
the receipts for the past six months. Of
this cum $1S59 40 represents monthly dues,
$4 fines and $10 overdrawn benefits re
turned.
Miss Jones offered an amendment re
ducing dues from $1 to Â«fl cents monthly,
and Miss Jennie Smith submitted an
amendment reducing fines fcr non-at
tendance at meeting* from Â£1 to 25 cents.
Both resolutions were carried by a large
majority."
When put to vote Mrs. Burke's amend
ment was carried by a large majority
Mies Hodgklnson offered a resolution that
Miss Hart and Miss Frontin. the two
beneficiaries who would be affected by
the amendment of Mrs. Burke, remain
beneficiaries of the society until the next
FC-ml-annual meeting. The resolution was
unanimously adopted. By the next meet-
Ing of the society a new resolution that
will fit just such cases as Miss Hart's and
Ml*s r rontin's will be presented.
The payment o* $5 per week, as tx-neflu In
fxtreme oases, arter the $.".00 has been paid
to the member, mar be continued at the dis
cretion of the board of directors, who muÂ»t
place the matter before the committee of ln
\ eftiiration. and must present the case at the
next semi-annual meetins of the society
Anonymous letters touching upon the
case were also received bv the officers of
the roclety. and so finally it was decided
to appoint an edvisorv board, with power
to act in the matter. This advisory com
mittee consisted of Mirs C. L. Hunt Miss
F. Jewett, Mrs. L. K. Burke Miss Rt G.
Campbell and Miss S. J. Jones. At yester
day's meeting the advisory committee,
through its chairman. Miss Hunt, declarea
that it had thoroughly investigated the
matter, that it found all the moneys re
ceived by Miss Cornelia Hart strictly ac
counted for and further recommending
that it be the pleasure of the society to
continue to pay the $20 to Miss Hart for
the use of her Incompetent sister
The report of the advisory commfttee
provoked much discussion, some of which
was material but much more was ir
relevant. The matter was finally and
<juickly disposed of by Mrs. L. IC Burke
who proposed to amend article XV on
dues ar.d benefits of the society, by strik
ing out the following section:
Most of the discussion of the meeting
was caused by a letter from Attorneys
Sullivan & Sullivan, In which they called
the attention of the society to the case of
their client. Mi^s Susie Hart, who on ac
count of her unfortunate physical condi
tion has been a pensioner of the society

Mrs. Fannie Ramon, Mrs. Westerfeld's
mother, appears as guardian ad lltem In
the divorce proceedings, as the wife has
not yef reached the legal age of dis
cretion.
When Westerfeld was 17 years of age
and his wife two years his junior the>
met and fell In what they thought was
love. In December, 18P8, they disap
peared. After anxious search they were
located In Stockton, even though they
were denied the right to marry, being
minors and without evidence that their
parents consented to their union. A de
tective broke In on their billing and coo-
Ing and rushed them home to face
parental wrath. A consultation of par
ents was held and it was decided that the
children must marry. They were mar
ried, but now the end is near.

ITesterfeld may also turn to the stage
That fame may be the balm to heal his
wounded mind. He was employed at the
Alcazar, f.rst 3.Â« a scene shifter, then as
property man and occasionally In small,
very small, parts. Finally he invented a
process for cleaning carpets and as this
invention demanded his entire attention
he shook the dust of the histrionic world
irom his feet and sought the commer
cial. As his venture failed to enrich him
he turned to other fields, the sod of
which he is now overturning in search of
material wealth.
Mrs. Westerfeld alleges fai'.urs to pro
vide and cruelty- Within three days

Mrs. \\>sterfeld says hfr hu?banrt beat
her with a hair brush and she left him
forthwith. Her diamond*, she says, went
one after the other to procure money for
their support anu Westerfeld appropriat
ed most of the money. Finding herself
dependent UDon her own resources she
secured an engagement as a chorus

The steamer Thyra of the Santa Fe line
due this morning from San Diego will
ai&o be repaired. While discharging one
of the cargo booms dropped and much
of the standing rigging waÂ»j damaged and
some of the deck plates cracked. She is
under charter to the Government to load
for Manila at Portland and she must get
away from here Sunday. A gang of men
from the Risdon will go north on her

Steamers Under Bepair.
The grain handlers on Sections 1 and 2
of the seawall went on strike last Thurs
day. They had been working ten hours
a day for 53, but when the mttlmen began
to agitate for an eight-hour day the grain
handlers thought that in their case nine
hours would make a fair day"s work. The
demand was accordingly made upon
George Maxwell and John Sullivan, the
principal employers of labor on the sea
wall. They refused to concede the hour
and the strike was on. There is a great
quantity of grain moving just now and it
did not take long to load up the seawall.
Then the chief wharilnger took a hand
and ordered the wheat oit the wharf. This
brought matters to a crisis and the mat
ter was settled yesterday. The men now
work_/nine hours for $3.

Supreme Court Punctures the Act
Designed to Suppress Liquor
Traffic.
The Supreme Court has knocked a big
hole in an amendatory act of the Legis
lature relating to the regulations of sani
tary districts. It was in the habeas cor
pus case of II, C 'Werner, who Was con
victed of selling liquor in the North Pasa
dena sanitary district in violation of an
ordinance passed by the board prohibiting
such traffic without a license from the
board. He was fined JIT., with an alterna
tive of fifteen days in the County Jail. He
appealed to the Superior Court, where
judgment was sustained, and he "went to
jail. His attorney secured a writ of ha
beas corpus and yesterday "Werner was
ordered dis charged from custody.
In 1^1 the Legislature passed an act for
the establishment of sanitary districts In
townFhips. and in 1S95 it was slightly
amended, extending the power to regula
tion "for the good order and welfare of
the district." This gave the prohibition
ists an opportunity to sit down on the sa
loon men in several parts of the State, and
a number of new sanitary districts sprung
up at once.' Werner attacked the validity
of the ordinance under which he was con
victed and the constitutionality of the
amendmenfto the act mentioned. In the
first he contended that the legislature
had no right nor did it Intend to confer
municipal powers upon sanitary districts.
and. second, that the amendatory act did
not embrace in the title the subject mat
ter of the act. as required, by law. The
Supreme Court upholds these contentions.

SURPRISING
How Kailroads Can Afford Such
Cheap Excursions.
One of the most interesting short excur
sions of the year from San Francisco is
the early autumn jaunt to the "Monterey
Bay points, which includes Del Monte.
Monterey and Pacific Grove, all being
within a short walk of each other. These
excursions were instituted by the South
ern Pacific several years ago. and because
of the extradrrlinary pleasures afforded
and the absurdly small cost, $2 for the
round trip, one-third less than half fare,
they at once became extremely popular.
This year the event is scheduled for Sun
day. September 2, and all signs indicate
a greater day than usual. - \
In the past the citizens of Monterey
have contributed to the Interest of the
day by reviving the old-time Spanish
sports, but this year the programme will
be varied by a sort of "go as you please"
pastime among the various attractions of
the resorts. Del Monte and its magnifi
cent grounds, its fine bathhouse and
beach, the famous eighteen-mile drive and
the pretty city of Pacific Grove will fur
nish all the entertainment that . can be
crowded Into five hours.
The train will leave Third and Townsend

RESOURCES.
According to the reports of thenine city
savings banks to the State Board of Bank
Commissioners, the pain in deposits since
July 31. WJ. was â¢ $7.18*5.713 71. This the
Commissioners consider is one of the most
convincing signs that the country is gen
erally prosperous. At the close of busi
ness hours on July 31 of last year the city
banks showed that there was due to the
depositors the total sum of $U3,21M.213 99.
A week ago a call was made by the Bank
Commissioners for statements of business
at the close of business hours on August
11. In responseHhe returns show that
there is due to depositor3the surprisingly
large sum of $12O.1SO.S27 70, or an increase
In 'deposits of J7.1St).713 71 in a little over
twelve months.
While the board knew in a general way
that the returns would be large the mem
bers were not prepared for a showing
amounting to over seven million dollars.
In discussing this matter Secretary Dun*
moor stated that these deposits were made
almost entirely by the working class and
those in moderate circumstances. The
banking business of the capitalist Is done
almost exclusively through the commer
cial banks. He added: "Notwithstanding:
the late war with Spain, the trouble in the
Philippines and China and the war taxes
that have to be raised from all classes of
society for these great national expenses,
the patrons of savings banks in this city
have laid aside more money for a rainy
day than ever before. Yet Bryan says
that the country is going to the dogs."

dent just before his death was the meet
ing of Nichols and his brother, Bert
Nichols. The two had not spoken to each
other for. four years. They had a mis
understanding and although on two oc
casions Bert tried to make up, the eider
brother refused to recognise him. When
the younsrer Nichols entered the hos
pital the wounded policeman grasped his
hand affectionately and said:
"Welt: it's all off, Bert."
Nichols could give only a partial de-
Fcription of his assailant. He was of me
dium build and wore a short frock coat
and soft Alpine hat. He had a dark,
heavy mustache. It was too dark, he
said, to distinguish the man's other fea
tures. Nichols said that If there had been
a light in the saloon he would probably
have been able to get out of range of the
burglar's gun.
The merchants of that section of the
city where the murder occurred are much
stirred by the affair. For weeks, they
say, this quarter has been the scene of
repeated butglaries. Among the places
entered were Robert Duff's commission
house at Commercial and Davis streets,
Patek's butcher-shop at the corner of
Washington and Sansome streets; J. B.
Inguglia's market at 502 Merchant street,
the Amerlcn Union Fish Company and
O. Ginocchl & Co. at -512 Sansome street.
It Is believed that all of these robberies
were committed by the same person or
gang. In every ; case the telephone box
was rifled or tampered with and the cash
register or money drawer pried open. En
trance was usually gained by forcing the
door with a "jimmy."
Shot at Close Quarters.
A common piece of Iron was used In
gaining an entrance to Galli's saloon. The
door swings out, and it was a matter of
little difficulty to pry the lock. The upper
part of the door is of ground glass. Di
rectly opposite the saloon on the Mer
chant-street f;ido, is a street lamp. From
the Inside of the saloon an object in front
nf the door outside is plainly discernible.
It is the opinion of tho police that the
burglar saw Nichols as he approached the
entrance. '
Nichols told the officers that when he
attempted to push in the door there was a
resistance inpirle. lie finally forced it and
at the same instant got a bullet in his
abdomen, tho muzzlo of tho pistol being
so clos<- to hln body that the powder
burned his clothe?. Nichols turned around
to avoir! another shot ;md simultaneously
the burglar .fired again. The policeman
foil out on tho sidewalk, but managed to
jlraw his pistol nn<1 fire twice at the flee
ing robber. One phot struck the side of
tlie saloon. No trace has been found of
tne other shot, and It may have hit the
burglar.
Chief Seymour thinks the burglar was
familiar with the district and the habiti
of the proprietor of the saloon. It is cus
tomary of Mr. Galli to close the 'place
about 7 o'clock Thursday evening, re
opening again at midnight, when the
fishermen begin to arrive with their Fri
day's stock. The thief evidently thought
he would find the receipts of the day In
the cash druwer and slot machine. But
it happened that Galli emptied hl3 cash
drawer before locking up, so the burglar
got nothing.
The detectives brought James Cox to
the station about 4:30 yesterday after
noon. They found him in a lodging house
on Folsom street. Half an hour later
they arrested McGregor in a saloon at
the corner of Fourth and Folsom streets,
McGregor has served a term of two years
for burglary. He has been out about rive
months. Both men claimed they were
In South San Francisco until 10:30 o'clock
Thursday night. Cox's right hand was
bandaged and he was sent to the Receiv
ing Hospital to have the wound examined.
The hospital physicians reported that the
Injury could not have been caused by a
bullet.
Confess to Several Burglaries.
In the course of the examination by
Chief Seymour the men confessed to hav
ing robbed a tailorshop at 190 Jesse street
three weeks ago, the Union candy work3
oji Fourth street an.i the residence of
Mrs. Valerie at 428 Pacific street two
weeks ago. They got away with about
$300 worth of jewelry at the latter place.
Detectives were busy last night investi-
K-atinK the truth of the stories told by
the two men relative to their whereabouts
Thursday evening.
The body of Nichols is now at Hal
ftead's undertaking rooms on Mission
street, where the funeral will be held Sun
day. Nichols was a member of the Â£\>r
esters, Benevolent Order of Elks and the
Special Police Ofticers' Association being
secretary of the latter organization. He
was born in Lakeville. Sonoma County
CaL, 40 years ago. He was the son of
A. R. Nichols, a pioneer carpenter of San
Francisco. He leaves a wife, three chil
dren and a brother. When he left his
notne at 427 Banks street, Bernal Heights
Thursday afternoon the last thing Nich
ols said to his wife was: "Look out for
me at the bottom of the hill to-morrow
mornincr and brinjr the children." Inva
riably the wife and children would meet
him on the hillside upon his return from
work.
Â¦\\ hen Nichols pockets were searched at
the hospital his revolver was found to
have contained but two cartridges both
of which had been fired. This peculiarity
is explained by his wife, who says they
were out on a tug Wednesday and Nichols
nrcd several shots at a bird and he must
have.lorgotten to refill the chambers
Laptain Seymour thinks the shooting
should result in the passage of an ordi
nance compelling all .stores to keep a lifrht
burning at night. The absence of a -ht
in a store would then warn the police that
something was wrong.

after midnight by Sergeant of Po
lice Helms on suspicion of being
the burglar who shot and fatally wounded
Special Policeman George F. Nichols
Thursday evening while resisting arrest
in the saloon of F. Galli at the corner of
Sansome and Merchant streets. Nichols
died at the Harbor Receiving Hospital
at 10:20 o'clock yesterday morning.
Daley was locked up in the tank at the
City Prison and will be put through the
sweating process by Chief of Detectives
Seymour this morning. He answers the
rather meager description given by Nich
ols of his slayer In every detail and the
police are confident they have, ihe right
man.
Two other suspects, Raymond Marion,
alias McGregor, and James Cox, both of
South San Francisco, were taken Into
custody by Detectives Anthony, Graham
and Fitzgerald yesterday afternoon on
suspicion of being connected with the
murder of Special Nichols. They were
put through the "sweating" process
for two hours at police headquarters
and at the close of the examination the
chief stated that he was pretty well sat
isfied that McGregor and Cox had noth
ing to do with the Sansome-street
tragedy. Their arrest, however, has
given the police light on a number of
small burglaries that have been commit
ted In the city of late, and both will be
held for breaking into three different
places since August 1.
SpecisJ Policeman Nichols was game
to the last. Although he suffered in
tense pain he bore up bravely and sub
mitted to repeated operations by Dr.
Kobinson at the hospital. One bullet,
which entered the back on the left side,
was taken out of the right side of the
abdomen. The second bullet entered the
abdominal cavity and was not recovered.
It was this shot that killed the police
man.

Nichols was Conscious while the prob

physicians and attendants in the midst
of the most painful periods. "Don't
tickle me, whatever you do." he would
pay as the doctors pierced his iU-sh with
tiie sharp instruments.
Nichols' devotion to his wife and fam

lay on the operating table. Once, when
they took his money and counted it, he
requested that fifty cents be saved out
to pay a messenger whom he desired to
have notify his wife. A pathetic inci-

(Concluded.)
'Colonel Higginson, in the book . I have
quoted, tells how, one summer day in
passing Cralgio house, he fell in with a.
young man who was eager to learn, the
whereabouts of that chestnut tree. The
colonel says:
I explained to him that the tree â¢ â¢ â¢ had
now vanished altogether, but offered to .show
him where it once was and where the black
smith, shop of Dexter Pratt had stood. Yvalk
lng down the street with him 1 won his con
fidence by telling him that 1 was one of the
Cambricge-bred boys who had "looked in at
the open door'"; that the blacksmith's wffe.
Kowena Pratt, had been my nurse, and that
I had. in later life heard her daughter sing.
He told me in return that he was a youn^
Irishman, arrived in this country but the dÂ«iy
before; that the first poetry he had ever learned
by heart at school was "The Village Black
smith," and that he had resolved that his first
act on reaching Boston should be to visit the
chestnut tree. "This," I said to myself, "Is
fame."
The tree, though no longer to be seen
on Brattle street, flourishes in immortal
green in the poem, and the spot where it
stood will continue to be pointed out from
generation to generation; but, curiously
tnough, the name of the blacksmith came
near being lost. Within a year there was
a lively discussion in a Bosion newspaper
whether the man was Pratt or anotner
smithâ I forget his name â who wa* the
tenant of the shop about the same time.
It will be seen that Colonel Higginson's
book (published since the discussion ap
peared) settles the question, which, if I
remember right, was not satisfactorily de
cided in the newspaper.
If the name -of tne village smith had
been utterly lost his memorv would never
theless live in the poets verse. There is
no record of the name of the "Highland
Girl" whom Wordsworth saw near the
little waterfall at Inversnaid. Nothing is
known of her history before or after she
caught the poet's eye, as he was rambling
with his sister on the shores \>f Loch Lo
mond. But the poem has made the water
fall famous, though otherwise one would
scarcely notice it when he lands at In
versnaid to take the coach for Loch
Katrine and the Trossachs. Now every
tourist wants at least to get a glimpse of
it while the coaches are loading, or climbs
the short pathway beside It while they
crawl up the long, steep ascent of the
highway, and joins them at the top of tho
hill; and he carries away with him, as the
poet did, the vision of that lovely peasant
girl, nameless but enshrined forever In
Knglish verse:
For I, methinks, till I prow old,
As fair before me shall behold
As I do now the cabin email.
. ' The lake, the bay, the waterfall.
And thee, the spirit of them all!
Forty years after "The Village Black
smith" was written the poet, on his sev
enty-second birthday (February 27, 1879)
was presented by the children of Cam
bridge with a chair made from the wood
of the chestnut tree. The gift was appro
priately acknowledged by a poem ad
dressed to the children, which he had
printed on a sheet and used to give to
each child who visited him and sat In the
chair, as many of them did. Here the
single line given to the tree In the orig
inal poem is expanded into several
stanzas:
Well I remember It in all Its prime.
When in the summer time
The affluent foliage of its branches made
A cavern of cool shade. ,
There by the blacksmith's forge beside the
street.
Its bWSsoms white and sweet.
Kntlced the bees, until It seemed alive
And murmured like a hive.
And when the winds of autumn, with a shout.
Tossed its great arms about.
The shining chestnuts, bursting from tne
sheath, â¢
Dropped to the ground beneath.
I see again, as one in vision sees.
The blossoms and the bees,
And hear the children's voices shout and call.
And the brown chestnuts fall.
And thus, dear children, have ye made for me
This day a Jubilee.
And to my more than three-score years and ten
Brought back my youth again.
Only your love and your remembrance could
Give life to this Sead wood.
And make these branches, leafless now ao lone.
Blossom again in sons.
Longfellow was fond of Charles River,
as seen in -the distance from his house,
and hcught a tract of several acres on
the other side of Brattle street that tho
view might not be, cut off if the land
should- be built upon. After his death
this 'and was bought by a public sub
scription and converted "into a pleasant
park as 'a memorial of the poet.
In tho poem "To the Uiver Charles."
after referring to sundry reasons for lov
ing it, he says:
More than thisâ thy name reminds me
Of three, friands, all trus an-1 tried;
And "that name, like magic, binds me
Clcser, closer to thy side.
The three friends a're not Identified in.
the biography by his brother, who <*oes
not happen to comment on this particular
poem; but they arc known to have been
Charles. Sumrier, Charles Fol3om and
Charles ' Amory.
Lowell has also celebrated the Charles
River in more than one of his poems: as
in "An Indian Summer Reverie" where
fifteen Spenserian stanzas are given to a
description of the stream and the marshes
bordering itâ "dear marshes"â as seen
from spring to winter); "An Invitation"
(whore again it is dwelt upon lovingly
and lingtringly). and "Under the Wil
lows," where he says:
the sliding Charles,
Blue toward the west, and bluer and more blue.
Living and lustrous as a woman's eyes
Look once and lojk no more, with southward
curve
Ran crinkling sunninpjs. like Helen's hair
Glimpsed in Elysium, insubstantial eold.
And so on to the end of the poem. I
must not take space lor the entire pass
age. ,
The "Willows" are near the river anrl
not far from Elmwood. marking th<;
course of a streamlet, now filled up or
covered up, which flowed into the Charles.
Lowell describes them as
six, a willow Pleiades,
The seventh fallen, that lpan al^ng the brink
Where the steep upland dips into the marsh.
Their roots, like molten metal cooled in flow
ing.
Stiffened in coils and runnela down the banit.
These trees a few years ago were likely
to be destroyed, as the ground was want
ed for house lots, but the protests against
the vandalism saved them from the fate
that earlier had befallen the chestnut
tree. More recently three of them have
: been Included in the park which is being
made on the river bank.
The Charles also flows under thÂ»Â» usly
old bridge that suggested Longfellow's
poem "The Bridge." After having: been
partially rebuilt several times", with no
material improvement in its architecture,
it Is now undergoing demolition and will
he replaced by a more sightly structure.
Nobody Is disposed to protest against tho
destruction of this "bridge with wooden
piers" as against the felling of the chest
nut tree and the willows. It was not oM
enough to be venerable or to have any his
toric interest, and its ugliness was not
picturesque. The poet was not tempted to
describe it except in the four words I
' have quoted, and his reflections as he
"stood on the bridge at midnight" are
such as might have occurred to him on
any other bridge at the same place. The
chestnut tree was by no means a fine spec
imen of its species, but the poem linking"
it with a story of humble village life gave
it an Interest at once human and poetical.
The willows were picturesque in their oM
age, but that would not have saved them
; if a poet had not loved them and described
I them, and thus entwined their memory
with his own.
Lowell, by the way. refers to the brldgÂ«
In his ode on the death of Agassiz. but It
is only the river and its surroundings on
which he dwells. He alludes to a "home
ward walk" with his friend
Across the bridge, where, on the dimpling tfda
The long red streamers from the windows glide.
Or. the dim western moon
Rocks her skiff's image on the broad hgoon.
And Boston shows a soft Venetian stde
In that Arcadian light when roof and tree.
Hard prose by daylight, dream In Italy.
I wanted to refer to other local allusions
in the verse of Longfellow. Lowell and
Holmes, and to sundry other matters con
nected with their personality, but already
' I have exceeded the space allowed me and
must close this random talk â for such only
it is. \V. J. ROLFE.

LITERARY TALKS AND REMINISCENCES.
Carpenters were called from work yester
day on three buildings to which lumber
from mills working nine hours per day
was traced. The fact was made konwn
through the patrol system the millmen
have. There was one other development
yesterday in tho controversy between the
millowners and the Millmen's Union.
This was the adoption of a resolution by
the Associated Lumbermen and the Re
tail Lumber Dealers' Association pledging
"moral and financial support to the mill
owners." On both sides, therefore, the
contest was widened somewhat. The Mill
men's Union did not take any additional
action yesterday, nor did the millowners.
The resolution adopted by the Associated
Lumbermen and the Retail Lumber Deal
ers' Association was preceded by several
whereases. The full text is as follows:
Whereas, Certain of the workmen in the
planlnsr mills of this city have inaugurated a
strike, demanding of their employers that eight
hours shall constitute a day's work; and
Whereas, Tho mills of all localities with
which Pan Francisco planing mills compete,
viz.: all points In California away from San
Francisco Bay, Oregon. Washington and the
States east of the Rocky Mountains work ten,
eleven and twelve hours per day and pay twen
ty-five per cent to fifty per cent less wages
rer day; and
Whereas, Recently compiled figures show that
practically fifty per cent of the mill work done
In this city Is shipped to other localities, viz.:
Interior California, Honolulu. Mexico, Central
and South A mPrlca . and tne Eastern States;
and
Whereas, The usual high cost of mill work,
in this city, as compared with other localities,
has driven a large volume of lumber business
away that naturally belonged to the city and
thus deprived San Francisco workmen of the
work, the business community of the profits,
and the city nenerally of the advantage of the
commerce to which it was justly entitled. Full
proof of this Is furnished by the fact that a
large portion of the lumber used in this city
Is worked before It is shipped here; and
Whereas. The planing mill workmen, gener
ally, are among the best paid tradesmen of this
cityâ fully competent men commanding $3 to
$4 per day; and
Whereas, San Francisco, from its natural
Reographlcal situation and proximity to the
best forests in the world, should grow to be
one of the greatest lumber markets in the
world, but. as a matter of fact (which is eas
ily proven), has lost ground in recent years;
and
AYhereas. We believe the workmen are mis
led and are working against their own beat
.interests by insisting on that which would
treatly reduce the volume of work in this vi
cinity, and hence increase the competition
among themselves for the positions, and. there
fore, prevent many men finding work at their
chosen vocation, or compel what is generally
conceded to be a good class of cltzens to move
from this locality; therefore
Resolved, That we believe the millowners are
entitled to the favor of the community and
we hereby, pledge them our moral and If need
be our financial support to the end that they
may fully dictate tho management of their
own mills, believing: the workmen have little
at which they can Justly complain, and con
trary to the expectations of the workmen, thai
could they sustain the position they have
taken. It would be to their disadvantage as well
as to the disadvantage of their employers and
the community at large.
The mlllmen say that the action men
tioned in the foregoing does not signify
that the millowners have received any
added support, and explain in connection
with this assertion that the mills are
really largely owned by the lumber deal
ers. This is the view of the matter taken
by W. J. Black of the Millmen's Union as
he expressed It last night.
P. II. Goff of the executive committee
of the Building Trades Council said last
evening that the watch upon the lumber
turned out by the nine-hour mills is main
tained by night as well as by* day, and
that all the members of the trades repre
sented by the Building Trades Council are
kept informed concerning the destination
of all "unfair" lumber, and so are enabled
to take measures to see that the cause of
the millmen is not jeopardized by ignor
ance of the plans of the millowners and
sympathizers.
President McCarthy of the Building
Trades Council says that he knows about
the disposition of all the work sent out by
the non-union mills, and that he will no
tify all contractors who receive any of the
material of such origin. If the contractors
do not take the desired stand in the mat
ter their employes will be called out in all
instances. In this way the "unfair" lum
ber will be kept out of local use. Five
merchants and others, so Mr. McCarthy
added, sent back yesterday materials to
the "hine-hour mills that had been fur
nished for use in making repairs, and' he
expects" others to act in the same way.
Permission will be granted to the owners
of fair mills to run shifts by night as well
as by day, as by this means many of the
members of the Millmen's Union will be
able to pet work, and .the capacity of the
fair mills will be enlarged sufficiently to
enable them to satisfy all the local de
mand for materials for building.

Sides.

The complication that has arisen In the
case of Servant William Price, the
charpe that he is not a member of the
department because he tendered his
resignation July 12 last year when he
esked to be put on the pension list, has
caused considerable commotion among
rr.Â»n who are drawing a pension.
It is considered improbable that the
rommissior.ers will /lake advantage of
a t-chnicaJIty to deprive a. deserving and
-r^clent officer of his position as a mem
r^r of the department just when it has
bt-en announce by the City and County
Attorney that he was illegally disrated
from lieutenant to sergeant by the old
board. Price Fimnly adopted the form
in vcpue as it was deemed necessary to
liret tender a resignation to the Police
Board before being put on the retired
list, the two boards boing separate and
<. stinct although formed of the same
.men. If Price had written: "I herewitn
tender my resignation as u active mem
ber of the department," instead of, "as
a member of the department.' there
could have been no dispute. The fact of
JTseif that ho was placed on the pension
mil showod that he was still a rmniber
of the department.
An examination of the records yester
<5ay showed that a large number who
arv> drawing pensions have noÂ«?n retired
a> Price was retired under the disabil
ity ciauee. They are in the same po-
FH!<-n and somÂ»Â» of them like Price have

Th^m are: C. C. Well?, retired January

at th* same time as Price.

NEW YORK. Aug. 24.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Â¦ '
Pronounced dullness etlll prevails In the
stock market, the total transactions at the
New York Stock Exchange on several days
this week falling to below Â¦ 100,000 shares. The
public Is entirely out of the market and the
large financial Interests are apparently waiting
for a revival of general activity. Some invest
ment purchases are apparently In nrogress
from time to time In the dividend paying part
of the railroad share list and there has also
been more or less manipulation of a few stocks.
It is, however, a long time since the market
has been so lifeless or so devoid of features.
The London market Is to all appearances as
dull. If not duller, than our own. The large
Increase of the Bank of England's gold re
8ervf^, amounting to Â£4,400,000, representing
the shipments from New York on account of
the war loans subscriptions, has eased the
London money market to such an extent that
there Is no longer any - reason to apprehend
further withdrawals of gold from this country.
Tho money market has been relieved from this
danger and at the same time has been helped
by the large disbursements the New York
sub-treasury has made on account of the re
demption of the old 2 per cent bonds. . Easy
money, however. Â¦ has .little effect In view of
the total absence of speculative Interest.
The crop news was on- the whole favorable,
desr>lte the prevalence of drought in the ex
treme West. Little effect was produced by the
greater activity of the iron . and steel . trades
though the Industrials as a class were firmer.
The general list was on the whole steady and
bear selllnjr by the traders did not bring out
any stocks. The only real activity was In ' a
few manipulated Issues. 1

NEW YORK. Aug. 24.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say: The sky
is not cloudless, but there has been no back
ward movement of. business this week. The
chief .drawback of the week haÂ« been the in
tense heat in some sections of the West, which
was more efficient in retarding business than
the lower temperatures East was in stimu
lating It. Crop advices continue as cheerful
as at any time lately and the labor situation
shows no important chances in working: forces.
Prices are steady, but there is talk of a de
cline, perhaps $10 per ton in steel rails, shortly.,
to a basis at which it Is believed the railroads
will be willing to place orders for the en
eulng year's supplies. More good news cornea
from the great iron centers, where bridge and
boat builders and makers of agricultural im
plements, stoves and cast iron pipe are all
eager to secure raw or partially finished ma
terial. Prices are sustained and In a few caaes
move upward. Iron generally Is a more solid
and better balanced market than for tw<Â»
months past. Reduction in output of pig is
having the desired effect at most Northern
points, though at the South stocks are still
heavy and complaint Is heard of prohibitive
freight rates to the seaboard. Large export
business is waiting and foreign buying of fin
ished material continues large.
Production of coke has been decreased to
143,9*0 tons weekly in the Connellsville region.
Another sharp decline has taken the price of
tin to $30 12H. but copper Is firm.
Wheat declined still further on Saturday,
touching the lowest price since early in June,
and making the fall 15%c from the top point
of the season, about two months ago. Vig
orous marketing by farmers shows their wil
lingness to sell at current prices, receipts at
primary markets during three weeks amount
ing to 19.999.900 bushels, against 10.633,051 last
year. Daily figures of export* continue light,
although there Is much talk of purchases for
foreign account. Prices recovered from the
lowest point, traders on the short side taking
profits freely. May corn is steady, but a drop
last year makes the present price Only 4c
above that of 1S99.
Sales of wool at the three chief Eastern mar
kets have increased to 5,062,500 pounds, against
4.231,800 in the week previous. To-day's wool
was active in Boston and territory grades are
all firmly held, though prices are nominally
unchanged. There Is no pressure to sell, some
dealers shipping Eait with Instructions to
hold until after election.
Factories are still working only part time
In the Eastern boot and shoe districts and it
Is evident that earlier estimates of accumulated
Btocks were much too email. There is more
activity in the hide market and prices are bus
talned by strong foreign quotations, activity in
Chicago by California tanners and favorable
purchases for harness.

COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
demand at leading Western markets. Prices,
too, are steady, what few decreases are noted
being largely due to Improved crop conditions,
particularly of corn and cotton. Despite the
reports which have pictured the corn crop as
heavily shortened by hot T winds the reports
to Bradstreefs from Nebraska. Kansas Citv
and St. Louis are as a whole quite encourag
ing. The lowered price of cotton is largely
due to the arrival of needed rains In the Soutn
Atlantic States.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 2,295.168 bushels, against 3,113,
641 bushels last week: 3,434,825 bushels In the
corresponding week of 1899, 3,565,476 bushels In
1898. 5,149,653 bushels in 1S97 and 3.2S1.854 bushels
in 1SS6.
k From July 1 to date this season wheat ex
ports are 23.696.44S bushelu, against 29,Â£J0S,Â«34
bushels last season and 05,906,552 bushels in
189S-99.

locomotives. Two of these are worth
while speaking of. The "Invlcta" Is the
first locomotive turned out. so the placard
reads, by Stephenson. and was the first

sition, ugly, pathetic and no longer of any
use. It is small, not more than ten feet
long. If so much, and its cylinders run
diagonally up either side. They give It a
very curious appearance. Its cab is too
small to be called one, and its entire ap
pliances are of the most meager descrip
tion. It Is covered with a coat of dead
black varnish, the "Invicta's shroud."
Curious as it Is at present, how much
more so It will be after a few more
centuries have passed! It is the property
of Sir David Salomons, Bart., and thus it
was brought from England especially for
the exposition.

sensation among the spectators, who ex

signed to a dungeon on some terrible
charge. But a minute later the Emperor
went on:

naming the new command.
The Emperor looked at him a moment
without speaking. Then he said in his
sharpest and most incisive tone: ,
Appearing before the Kaiser at his next
public reception, he respectfully pro
nounced the set phrase always used on
such occasions:
A major of cavalry not Ions asro suc

he came to Berlin to personally present
himself to his sovereign upon his pro

HAPPENINGS
Contractor Barrett has ordered the mill
work for the building from Tacoma mills
through the E. B. and A. L. Stone Com
pany of Oakland. To-day a delegate from
the Building Trades Council called on the
contracter and objected to the use of
material from the Stone Company, alleg
ing as a reason that the proprietors are
"unfair." The matter will probably be
adjusted. . . . . . . :
Those who have been active in advanc
ing the new library project are not a little
elated that actual work has already been
begun "on the structure. Six weeks before
Mr. Carnegie made his offer to the city
of Oakland he presented the citizens of
San Diego with $50,000 for a library, the
gift being made under the same conditions
as that of Oakland. Despite the advan
tage in time, San Diego has not yet been
able to arrange a contract for the con
struction of the building.
There was no speechmaklng or cere
mony of any sort The assistants of En
gineer Clement located the lot lines and
levels and drove stakes to Indicate where
the foundations will be placed. In the
afternoon the first. loads of building ma
terial were hauled to the ground. On
Monday a gang of men will begin the ex
cavations. . â¢ . Â¦ â¢Â¦ <. .

The greatest secrecy has been observed
In regard to the tlcketa'that will be voted
at the polls to-morrow. The candidates
fear that some advantage will be taken of
their announcements. In some parts of
the county there will be fotrr elections.
The entire county will vote for delegates
to the State convention and for a county
convention that will nominate Judges, but
only in parts of tho county will there be
a contest for State Senator and Super
visors. The tickets for delegates to the
State convention that will nominate elec
tors will be pink in color and the entire
county of Alameda will be entitled to vote
for such electors. No one seems to have
paid much attention to these tickets, but
they will be in every district.
The delegates to the county convention,
which will nominate two Judges, -will be
on white paper. There is no contest to
the renomination of Judges John EIIb
worth and F. B. Ogden and so there will
be no contest on th,e white tickets.
The bright red tickets will be for Su
pervisors, and the blue tickets for Statj
Senator.
In the Forty-ninth Assembly District
there will be but one ticket, upon which
Mitchell has named' twelve delegates and
Pierce twelve and ten of which are un
pledged. This ticket reads a* follows:
Frank K. George W. Reed.J. C.

"It is on this account that more erjuili
hrlstsâat least all those who perform in
midairâ aro extremely careful In ascer
taining whether the orchestra is able to
properly render the piece to which they
usually perform. This is absolutely neces
sary. One false note, one discord or one
break In- the music most probably would
result in a misstep and the consequent
fall and probable fatal injury of the
artist. What is more. If It were possible
to ascertain the exact facts In the canes
of those artists who have been killed by
falling from great heights while perform
ing some aerial feat I am certain It would
be found that In fully 90 per cent of the
cases there waa some sudden lull or jar
In the music which distracted their atten
tion and caused them to lose their bal
ance."âChicago Tribune.
""if the spectators could only understand
this more they would appreciate those
feats which are. as a kind of a grand
finale, often Klvon without the aid of the
orchestra. Most equilibrists nowadays
give one such exhibition at the end of
their performance, and any one of them
would tell you that the silence of those
few minutes when the orchestra has
ceased is the greatest nerve strain they
have to endure.
"In the first place; It encourages and
Rives confidence to an extent which would
astound any one who had never before
experienced It. Secondly, by always per
forming to one tune the artist Is able to
take his cues from it. and he keeps time,
much as a step dancer does. But, more
Important than these, Is the fact that the
music enables the performer to confine
his attention to what he is doing by
drowning any small noises among the
audience which might distract him.
Trifling noises are troublesome. Indeed, to
any artist who Is performing In midair.
Ing his "turn" Is absolutely necessary.
One well-known trapezist who is perform
ing, at one of the local theaters. In dis
cussing the matter.. said: "One of the most
difficult trials that an equilibrist can un
dertake .13 to give an exhibition without
the aid of an orchestra. YÂ»u probably
have noticed that all the time the per
former is going through his exhibition
good, stirring music Is being played, and
this is of immense assistance to the per
former in more ways than one.
HONOLULU, Auk. 17.â The labor situa
tion on the plantations Is still a matter
of much discussion, and planters await
with much interest the reports from those
who have gone to the States to Investi
gate the securing of another labor supply
to take the place of the Japanese. The
latter have ceased to strike, but they .are
found to be harder to control than before
the change to American laws, their new
found freedom giving them some strange
ideas as tor what they have a right to do.
It Is found that the men do much less
work now than they did under Hawaiian
laws, as they have no fear of the powers
of an overseer to invoke the aid of the
courts to make them live up to their con
tracts.
Many Japanese have left the plantations
altogether and are looking for easier work
such as hack-driving. There is also a dis
position among them to wander about tho
Islands, traveling from one island to an
other and leaving one plantation for an
other. Some of the plantations have
adopted a rule that they will not employ
a man who cannot present good creden
tials from the last plantation that em
ployed him.

charges are pr^frrred by W. B. Greene
fcaum, the titled woman's guardian. On
the strength of the perious allegations
made in an affidavit filed by Greenebaum
to-day Trustee Wakeman has been cited
to appear before Judge Greene on Sep
tember 4 to show cause why he should not
be prosecuted for the alleged embezzle
ment of funds placed in his care.
W. B. Greenebaum's affidavit makes
specific charges against Wakeman, al
leginR that he collected money as rent
and applied it to his own use: that he re
fused to recognize the legal guardian of
l^ady Yarde-Buller. ard that contrary to
law he assigned his trust to William H

serious charge of the affidavit Is included
in the follcTrfnp paragraph:
"Tho afflar.t avers on his information

to the languape of the circular ai
dressed to the merchants on the subject
of confining the decorations of their prem

half of the decoration committee It came
out that the language was only meant as

of flags across the streets and no arches
over the sidewalks.

; The residence of the late F. S. Douty.
secretary of the Pacific Improvement
Company at San Mateo, was sold yester
day. The purchaser is John W. Van
J Bergen, the well-known wholesale liquor
dealer of this city. Baldwin & Howell
were the brokers, and the price obtained
was in the neighborhood of $23,000. Tie
lot has a frontage of over 400 feet on Elm
street and a depth of nearly 200 feet. The
residence is conceded to be the finest in
San Mateo. This sale indicates that the
extension of the electric road to San
Mateo Is already creating a demand for
town property there. Heretofore the de
mand has been confined to small Invest
ments within the city limits of San
Alateo. Mr. Van Berpen expects to take
possession of his new home within the
I next month.

CHAHLES WILLIAMS, WHO BECEIVES A CENT FOB. HIS
REPUTATION.
"Hereafter families of standing will bo
loth to accept as sponsor for strangers
within the city's gates any men except
those of known probity and honor. The
HJtTRT Jn the Ur.U<?d States Circuit
Court awarded Charles Williams
Jj yesterday damages of one cent in
the ?uit for libel which he institut
ed against The Call. This verdict is of the
deepest significance. It serves as a warn
ing to all others of the stripe of Williams
who Mfk to violate the sanctity of the
home ajid prey upon society. Twelve men
of intelligence and probity, respecting the
laws which must . protect communities,
after a trial cf many days and a delib
<rata judgment of every fact in the case,
have llxed the value of this man's per
fional honor and his reputation at one
cent, the lowest expression of definite
value which we can find In our monetary
pystfin.
This verdict is a vindication of the- pol
icy of Tfc* Call, of which the expose of
Williams and his methods v.-as an inci
dent- This paper detmed It a duty to
show this man as he is when he dared to
infJct an injury upon an innocent and re
epected family of San Francisco. And
this paper will act in. the same way when
ever axid wherever necessity demands.
On October 11. 1S9S, The Call published
the character of Williams. This publica
tion xv&s made as a warning and as a
protection to a family upon one of whose
members Williams had designs. On Oc
tober 12. 13 and 14 similar articles were
published, ar.d upon the article of Oc
tober 14 Williams based his suit for libel
against The Call. This publication is now
a part of the record of the case in the
United States Circuit Court, from which
it is reproduced in full as follows:
"All possible tact and delicacy were
used In an endeavor not to link the name
of the impostor with the names of those
who. unfortunately, had come into close
social contact with him, admitting him
to their homes and entertaining him with
the lavish hospitality for which Califor
nia^ are noted. The unmasking of this
adventurer was a slow and difficult pro
cos*, necessitating the gathering of evi
dence from all parts of the world.
"The Information withheld would have
tended to make him despised of all men.
hut the object of this paper was not to
blast character, but to subserve the ends
of justice. Should the time come when
the evidence will be necessary to again
protect society, it will be forthcoming. It
"Although the charges were of the most
r-ensational character every effort was
made to present the facts clearly and con
cisely and not to pander to morbid cu
riosity. The paper has in Its possession
much more damaging evidence against
Mr. Williams than it has presented. The
information contained a mass of matter
of an offensive character. Only such was
used as proved absolutely necessary to
substantiate the charges originally pre
ferred by this paper.
"The ends of justice have been served,
so The Call now writes 'finis' to the last
chapter of the noted Charles A. Williams
case. The dÂ«.s5rÂ«* which actuated the ex
pose of the adventurer was to protect an
innocent girl from the clutches of a vil
lain and to rid society of an offensive
member. Persecution played no part in
it.

Conclusion off Has Seat for Label
Against The Call.
Williams filed a suit in the United
States Circuit Court claiming that the
foregoing publication had damaged him
to the extent of $255,000, for which he
sued. He returned from Johannesburg,
whither he haxl gone after the expose,
and prepared to prosecute his suit. He
was represented before United . States
Circuit Judge Beatty and a jury by ex
ceptionally able counsel. The trial began
on the 8th lnst. and to avoid even an in
sinuation that, it sought to influence a
judicial proceeding The Call refrained
absolutely from any reference to the
trial. In the personality of "Williams
this paper was wholly unconcerned ex
cept as he demonstrated himself to be
the type of those who are a menace to
society and violate its laws.
The trial was concluded yesterday after
noon, when the jury judicially appraised
the value of Williams' reputation not at
$255,000 but at 1 cent. This award of the
jury will bo paid by check by The Call
to Williams to-day. Under the judgment
of the Jury he will pay the costs of the
suit. This conclusion of the affair Is a
matter of gratification to this paper, as
it demonstrates that efforts honestly made

would injure it receive the indorsement
and vindication -of those In whose behalf

lines will be drawn more sharply to pre
vent a recurrence of the Williams epi
sode. An explanation seems due from the
social backer of this man who made
possible the plying of his nefarious trade
in this city.
"What plans Williams may have for the
future does not concern this journal. It
but echoes the sentiment of this com
munity in expressing: the hope that he
shake the dust of this city from his feet."

The City Attorney advised the Super

opinion grows out of the demands pre
sented by Health Officer O'Brien and Drs.

salaries shall be In full compensation for
all services rendered by city officials can

to any charter officer as to services not
rendered in his otlicial capacity.
In accordance with the opinion, the Su

vesterday to recommend the claims to the
board.

BOHEMIANS MUST
NOT PLAY POKER,
SAY DIRECTORS
Order Believed to Be the
Result of a Quarrel
Over the Cards.
There is to be no more poker playing
in the Bohemian Club. Notices were con
spicuously placed in different parts of tho
club yesterday signed by tho directors,
calling the members' attention to the fact
that in the future the rule would be en
forced.
The officers and the members â¢ of the
club are very reticent about the new rule
prohibiting gambling In the club being
held down so rigidly, but it is beginning
to leak out that the motive of the direc
tors' action Is a little episode in which
Edwin Stevens, the comedian, formerly of
the Tivoll, figured. Stevens was not a
member of the Bohemian Club, but still
he was a constant visitor there. In fact,
he went up to the jinks in the redwoods
with the rest the early part of this month.
He left for the East in the beginning
of this week to fill an engagement in New-
York. One night just before he left while
he was engaged in a game of poker at
the club he became in%'olved In a quarrel
with some of the members who were
playing with him. It is said that the lie
was passed and that the game broke up In
disorder. This is, so say some of the
members, the reason the directors have
stopped poker in the club.
Any way, the order is that there shall
be no gambling in the club, and the
officers In enforcing this order are merely
acting up to the rules which have been

of the Grand Jury Wllber promised to

The non-appearance of either \\ liber or
his witnesses caused a startling rumor to
circulate around the Grand Jury waiting
room to the effect that Wilber intended to
await an indictment at the hand3 of the
Grand Jury and then "spring^ his mys
terious witnesses on the Superior Court,

discomfiture. ,
There were half a dozen and more wit
nesses, all victims of the frauds, who told
the Grand Jury their troubles yesterday.
Their testimony was practically Identical,
in that they had all paid money for posi
tions they had never obtained.
Paris Kilburn, president of the Board
of Harbor Commissioners, was subpenaed.
but as he knew nothing about the case
he was not long detained. Attorney
Cleve-land Dam was questioned in regard
to Wilber's non-appearance and stated
that Wilber had promised him to produce
the witnesses in Dam's office, which had
not yet been done. .
"Jack" Tyrell, one of the employes of
the Internal Revenue office, also told what
he knew, which was not apparently much,
for he was in the room a very short time.
After hearing a few of the victims stor
ies the Jury took the matter under con
sideration until next Friday night. .
The last few weeks of James Taylor
Rogers' life have not proved altogether
a primrose path for the man witn the
skull cap; indeed the devious ways
which he has trod or been driven with
hardened heart and silenced tongue have
been paved with something a good deal
tougher than the springtime flower. His
sojourn beneath the halls where justice
is dispensed, while waiting for his sudden
affliction of dumbness to be lifted .from
him many have caused him to desire to
shake San Francisco's dust from off his
"Congresslonals."
Again the law business is badâ very bad
âparticularly of late. There is poor Jack
Chretien; things have not prospered with
him; and there are others. The decay of
the legal profession may have caused
Rogers to throw to the winds, or rather
second-hand dealers, his tomes. > Â¦
However buny conjecture is with his
name, James Taylor Rogers sits in his
home at 3333 Washington street, a "world
of strife shut out," and denies all knowl
edge of having -sold his books or dis
charged his stenographer.
When seen last night that young lady
paid Rogers had told her not to come to
the office after the 1st #f September, giv
ing as a reason that his business was not
what it used to be, wnich . is very prob
able. In the meantime there are no few
people in San Francisco who will watch
with breathless interest in which direc
tion the dumb attorney will make his next
move â out of law or out of San Francisco.
These two significant happenings indi
cate a move of some kind, either of lo
cality or profession, on the part of some
one. Â¦who is shrewdly conjectured by his
friends and enemies to be no less a per
son than James Taylor Rogers. The old
gentleman himself says he does not in
tend either to move away or to quit the
law business, but the fact remains his
law library is sold. And a lawyer without
books is about as much good as a liar
without a memory.

Maguire is not so sure regarding the
opening of the streets in the territory
bounded by Kentucky, Mariposa, Penn
sylvania avenue and Channel streets, ex
cepting Sixth and Sixteenth streets, which
were closed in 1S92 bv ordinance of the
Supervisors. The streets were ordered
vacated on the petition of the Southern
Pacific Company and it Is doubtful if the
city has any power to rescind the ordi
nance. The Street Committee will at Its
next meeting resubmit the question to
City Attorney Lane.
"I am growing impatient at tho delay
in the injunction proceedings." said Ma
guire yesterday. "The case was to have
been heard on August 20. but was con
tinued. My plan contemplates the or
ganization of a club whose object will
be to press the question of the removal of
the tracks to a conclus-Ion."
Maguire believes that there will be no
difficulty In proving to the satisfaction
of the court that the tracks are a nui
sance. He Is prepared to bring an in
definite number of witnesses to testify
that the clanging of bells, shrieks of
whistles, etc., interferes with the comfort
and peace of the surrounding residents.
It has not been decided whether the suit
will be brought by the city or by a tax
payer.
Maguire says he is determined to com
pel the corporation to take up the rails
and use its "cut off" along the bay shore.
After careful consideration of the propo
sition and the various interests involved
he has come to the conclusion that a suit
declaring the tracks a nuisance is the
proper method of procedure. In the event
that the court so decides, the Board of
Supervisors is clothed with the power to
pass an ordinance abating it. '
Commissioner Maguire of the Board of
Public Works Is having the necessary pa
pers prepared to have the Superior Court
decide if the Mission tracks are a nui
sance. Maguire chafes at the prospective
delay which will undoubtedly attend the
trial of the injunction proceedings brought
by the Southern Pacific Railway Com
pany against the ordinance passed by
the Board of Supervisors directing the
Board of Public Works to tear up the
tracks. This direction -was contingent up
on the failure of the corporation to re
move the tracks within a certain specified
time. The injunction proceedings resulted
and now Maguire fe3rs that it will be
several years before the right of the Su
pervisors to order the removal of the
tracks will be determined.

Dr. -Clark, who was called to attend
Stone just before he died, said last night:
"I was in my office when somebody told
me I was wanted at 240 Taylor street to
attend a man who was very sick. . I im
mediately went to the place and found
Stone in a dying condition. Thinking he
wag suffering with, heart trouble I gave
him a hypodermic injection, but he col
lapsed shortly afterward. I did not
notice any. symptoms of poisoning."
Stone gained considerable notoriety
some time ago through his connection
with a troupe of Filipinos, who had been
Imported here to take part at the Me
chanics' Fair. Representing that he was
possessed of great wealth he engaged the
troupe to give exhibitions throughout the
country. He first installed the Filipinos
in the Palace Hotel, but as he failed to
pay their bills they were ejected. He
threatened to sue the manager of the ho
tel for damages, but marched the Fili
pinos to the Bush-street Theater, which
was unoccupied, and told them to make
themselves at home. The lessee of the
theater, on learning that Stone and his
troupe had taken possession of the play
house, had them forcibly removed. by the
Sheriff. On the same night fire, broke out
In the- theater and almost destroyed it.
Suspicion was directed against- Stone, as
it was claimed that he had remarked that
he would set fire to the place in order to
be revenged. He was arrested, but was
subsequently released for lack of evi
dence.
Pound Stone Dying.
Immediately after Stone had breathed
his last his body was removed to the
Morgue, where an autopsy revealed, a
quantity of blood In the stomach. As a
precautionary measure. Dr. Leland, who
performed the autopsy, had the stomach
sent to Chemists Morgan and Green for
analysis. Last evening they reported
that they had discovered cyanide of
potassium In sufficient quantities to have
caused death. The heart was found to
be dilated and the liver in anything but
a healthful condition.
"It must be a mistake that poison caused
his death. He was the last man in the
world to commit such a rash act. For
many months he complained of pains
around his heart, hut attributed it to in
digestion. I am convinced that when the
truth is known it will he found that heart
failure caused his death and not cyanide
of potassium."
Must Be a Mistake.
"Realizing he was seriously ill. I sum
moned two men who were passing and
asked thorn to assist in removing my hus
band to our house, but they refused. Just
then another man, who was dressed in the
garb of a laborer, volunteered to assist
mo, and together we carried Mr. Stone
into the house. As he seemed to be dying
I sent for DK Clark, who has an office at
201 Taylor street, and he lost no time in
coming. A few minutes after his arrival
my husband breathed his last. I am sat
isfied that he did not commit suicide, as
we have always lived happily together.
He was devoted to his family and seemed
to live for them alone. When he gave me
the cup of coffee he was in a laughing
mood, and seerrted even happier than ever.
"Why, only a short time before he was
seized with the fatal attack," tearfully re
marked Mrs. Stone last night, "he walkea
into my bedroom and gave me a cup of
coffee. He seamed particularly cheerful,
and after leaving me .he kissed our eldest
(laughter, which was his usual custom
before leaving tho hou?e. A few minutes
later he walked outside, taking our little
daughter with him. They were not gone
long when the child came running into the
house with tho startling intelligence that
'papa Â¦ had fainted.' I ran outside and
found my husband half-lying on the stairs
leading from the upper flat."
; "Colonel" Walter E. Stone, who died
suddenly at his home, 240 Taylor street,
last Wednesday, presumably from heart
disease, is supposed, according to the re
port of the city chemist, which was filed
with Coroner Cole last evening, to have
committed suicide. An examination of his
stomach revealed a sufficient quantity of
cyanide of potassium to have caused
death. The widow and daughters of the
dead man ridfcule the theory of suicide.

Mark and Webster held a conference
Â¦vesterday regarding the purchase of sup
plementary readers to the value of $6000.
The contract with the Whitaker-Ray
Company called for a 2\i per cent dis
count. Webster claims that the firm
quoted the retail instead of the Â¦whole
tale price, thus making the cost about
20 per cent higher in favor of the firm.

t-xplanation? are found to be satisfac
tory he will be reinstated. If not his
suspension will be merged into a dismis
sal. The trial of the deaf teacher will
SlXbo be taKen up and Â«-er fate decided
upon.
Chairman Mark expressed himself him
self yesterday as not being entirely in
sympathy with Superintendent Webster's
enrollment Kcheduie. He says that where
classes are capable of accommodating
sixty pupils they will be filled up to the
quota. There was no intention, however,
<jf putting sixty pupils in a classroom
which had desks for only fifty. Inci
dentally Mark discussed the board's right
to suspend teachers, which Is denied by
Superintendent Webster. saying the
power was vested in the board by the
charter, which gives it the right to
c-stablish all necessary rules and regu
lations for the government and efficiency
of the schools.
It developed yesterday that Vice Prin
cipal Ebonezer Knowltoa of the Everett
Grammar School Is not the only teacher
under suspension by the School Board.
Chairman Mark admitted that there was
another who has been similarly dealt
with, but he positively refused to divulge
the name of the lady who Is under the
ban. He eald, however, that she will be
Investigated on account of her physical
infirmities, it being alleged against her
that she Is almost totally deaf. Mark
claims that this is sufficient cause for
suspending her pending the result of the
investiga-uon.
Inquiry at the secretary's office Bhowed
only Knowlton's suspension and nothing
was known about any other. From other
fiources the names of at least two teach
ers who are very deal were ascertained,
but Mark said that neither of them was
under consideration for suspension.
