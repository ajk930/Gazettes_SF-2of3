CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAN
JOSE. Sept. C â The represen
tatives of the unterrifled and
bold Democracy of the State
of California are In convention
assembled in this the Garden
City, to wrestle -with the problems of
| choosing candidates and framing a plat
! form that will contain a sufficiently lurid
pronunciamento against the Republican
party.
The committee of arrangements took
; hold of the decoration problem this morn
[ ing before the Victory Theater, where the
convention Is now In session, opened, and
by 11 o'clock the problem was solved.
Flags, the national colors and palm leaves
formed the basis of most of the decora
tion*, and pictures of Bryan and Steven
son were hung from the stage and boxes.-
A largÂ« fla? fell from the front of the
stage Just over the chairman's desk and
framed and oil painting of Bryan, tho
Democratic standard bearer. On both
sides of this hung flags, draped from the
files to the wings, and looped up behind
potted palms. Flags waved from the
boxes and more flags hid the railings and
framed the pictures of the Democratic
Presidential candidates hung from the
upper columns. Around these columns
evenrreens had been twined. The stage
was pet with a forest scene, and report
ers, convention attaches and committees
of prominent citizens filled the seats
among the trees. The auditorium was
dotted with blue silk banners bearing the
name* of the delegations that- sat under
them. The place of honor in the center
went to San Francisco. Los Angeles was
bestde It on the right and AlamedLa oh
This was done amid . tumultuous ap
plause, and Senator Sims appointed A. B.
Ware, M. F. Tarpey, Max Popper, Seth
Mann and Frank Gould as a committee
Warren English of Alameda also sec
onded the nomination and moved that the
nominations close and that the secretary
cast the ballot. , ., â¢;'$-';Â£
Then there was more applause and cries
of "Fitzgeraldâ Fitzgerald" cut Ware
short and he had to, conclude.
T. C. Coogan of Alameda seconded the
nomination.
"His name is R. M. Fitzgerald."
Mr. ' "Ware would have continued, but
shouts of "Name him! Xame him!" pre
vented further progress and Ware had to
shout:
Naming of Fitzgerald.
Let me say now, In regard to this cheap labor
question, that it is to the Democratic party
that we owe the fact that we have an exclusion
act. The trentleman I am gcing to name
fair-minded. It is a pleasure for me to nom
inate a man ". born" In this great Golden State
of our? â this State that will rank among the
foremost of this great nation, and I am glad
this gentleman will accept the nomination, for
honor should be Riven where honor Is due. I
am glad to b" able to say that this gentleman
has received an education In our own univer
sity; that he is sound and broad of mind, and
that his heart throbs in sympathy with his
people and with his principles. Gentlemen, the
person I shall name Is In line and touch with
all the statements ret forth in the platform
of the National Democratic Convention at
Kansas City. He believes In the Income tax:
he favors tho Nicaragua canal; the election of
United States Senators by direct vote of the
people. He is opposed to Imperialism and the
importation of Japanese. Chinese and Filipino

I take pleasure In namlnÂ» a sttrlln* Demo

A. B. Ware of Sonoma accepted the In
vitation and sought' the stage Jn response
to repeated calls for "Platform! Plat

Then the convention got down to busi
ness. First Senator 81ms paid a compli
ment to D. M. Delmas as an able speaker
and a good Democrat, and. announced tnat
Mr. Delmas would address the convention
in the afternoon. â¢ Then he called for nom
inations for temporary chairman.
Two songs were not enough and so a
man In the .gallery, rose and asked that
the "lady with the eloquent voice sing
'The Star-Spangled Banner.'" The "lady
with the eloquent -voice" was Miss Mary
Webster, and aided by the quartet ren
dered the song, while an Iroquols brave
brought forth a flag and every one stoo^l
up till the song was ended.
â¢ .Feast of Song.
"Hurrah for. Bryan," a campaign song
of the enthusiastic type, was well sung
by the Harmonia Quartet, composed o*
Mary E. Webster, Lulu Piepe, Ernest
Wentzel and Henri Dykmans.
There was great applause at this wel
come and amid the cheers that ' followed
were mingled shouts of commendation for
San Jose, the convention committees,
prospective candidates, the chairman and
every one concerned.
that you will return home and tell your own
wives that San Jose is not only the Garden
City, but the Princess of Hospitality. Gentle
men, San Jose la yours; the gates are open
and the bars are down, and if there is any
thing you want, just eay so and you shall
have It.
At nuch a time as this the citizens of San
Jose thoroughly appreciate the selection of San
Jom as the place of assembly for the Demo
cratic wisdom of the State. We shall appre
ciate It still more after the votes have been
counted. After your deliberations have been
completed w* will offer you suoh entertainment
SenaÂ£or Sims then introduced Victor A.
Schiller, who, on behalf of the Mayor of
San Jose, who could not attend, welcome i
the delegates to the Garden City and
promised the hospitality of a hospitable
city. He said:
At the mention of the names of Bryan
and Stevenson In his speech the delegates
rose to their feet and cheered and re
peated the cheer until they became tired.
At the close of Chairman Sims' address
the convention rose again and cheered tho
speaker. Then the band struck up "Amer
ica" and, still standing, the convention
Joined in the grand old chorus.
It was 11:40 a. m. when Senator J. C.
Sims of Sonoma, chairman of the State
Central Committee, stepped forward and
rapped the convention to order. The band
broke Into "There'll Be a Hot Time In the
Old Town," and the delegates stood up
and cheered. It was a warm welcome
that Senator Sims received, and the
speech he made was frequently punctu
ated with applause.
Sims Opens the Ball.
It was 11 o'clock before the doors were
opened, but after that it did not take long
for the theater to fill. The lower floor
was sacred to the delegates and the front
rows of the gallery wire reserved for the
ladles. The band started the enthusiasm
with the "Star Spangled Banner," and all
rose In respect to the national air.
to escort Mr. Fitzgerald to the chair.
There was great applause when the tem
porary chairman mounted to the stage,
and after shaking hands all round ha
rapped for order and made an able and
temperate speech.
As soon as the chairman had ceased
speaking and the applause had died away
Nicholas Bowden of Santa Clara moved
that the chair appoint a committee of
fifteen on credentials. This was objected
to on the ground that the officers of the
convention had not been elected, but M.
P. Tarpey explained that in courtesy to
the city Santa Clara County should bÂ©
allowed to name the officers. In antici
pation of this suggestion, which was put
in the form of a motion and carried, the
officers had already been named, and they
were announced as follows by the chair
man:
Secretary. J. P. Sexe: first assistant secre
tary, D. M. Burnett: second assistant secre
tary, Sewell Hatcher: third assistant secretary.
Gus Mullen: sergeant at arms. A. J. Cran
dall; stenographer, L. E. Bontz.
Then Bowden's motion was put and car
ried.
Tarpey of Alameda moved that the
chair appoint a committee of thirty-five
and a chairman on resolutions. This was
carried.
F. W. Allender of Los Angeles moved
that a committee of twenty-five on per
manent organization and order of busi
ness be appointed by the chair. Also car

Then motions to adjourn began to ex

iKkgatos of the back-number files were
saying to-day that The Call's forecast of
the nomination of W. C. Graves for Con-
in the Sixth District would not be
because Mr. Graves was sup
ported by the Southern Pacific Company.

CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SAX
TA CRUZ. Sept. 6.â The Re
publican State Convention ha*
finished its labors and Santa
Cruz has returned to the mon
otony of cvery-day life. The
great assembly of Republicans
ended Its session In an enthusiastic out
burst that augurs well for success.
There were cheers for the ticket and the
nominees: thanks to the generous people
of Santa Cruz; congratulations for th<s
officers and praise for their discretion ar.Â«J
impartiality.
The Republicans of California have hold
many successful conventions, but none
will surpass that which has Just closed In
pleasant memories and material results.
While the delegates were late in arriv
ing at the convention hall they were
prompt and ready In conducting and con
cluding their business when they did ar
rive. 1 They elected thetr permanent offi
cers, adopted a platform and ratified the
nominations of Presidential Electors
made by the seven Congressional conven
tions. Turning then to the business
which intimately concerned them as a
general body the delegates elected two
Presidential Electors at large. Samuel 3X.
Shortridge- of San Francisco and W. J.
Barrett of Los Angeles were unanimous
ly chosen.
In estimating the results of this conven
tion the address of Samuel M. Shortrldgra
delivered yesterday will receive the great
est consideration. Mr. Shortrldge was
chosen to enunciate the principles, char
acterize the aspirations and proclaim the
policy of- the Republican party of Cali
fornia In this campaign. In accepting this
duty Mr. Shortrldge evidently fÂ«lt Its
serious responsibilities and his effort
more than Justified the highest expecta
tions of his hearers. His address perhaps
will more truly be the platform of tha
party In this State than will be the doc
ument which bore that name to-day.
"When the convention had adopted Its
platform to-day, had ratified district
nominations, had chosen Its own electors
and had pledged an earnest, active, per
sistent rapport of the national ticket. It
listened to several addresses and. ad
journed. Just one hour, from 10:30 o'clock
thia morning to 11:30 o'clock, was con
sumed In the deliberations.
One of the pleasing features of tho
closing hours was the speeches. Includ
ing: one by Frank McGowan. In response
to the insistent demand Mr. McOowan,
answered, and his words were the last
to echo In the memories of the convention
delegates. He was eloquent, brilliant,
logical and enthusiastic. In part he spoke
as follows, and his stirring words gava
fitting conclusion and climax to the Re
publican convention of 1300:
"I want a republic imperial In Its devo
tion to labor; In Its sacred regard for the
rights of American citizens.
"I want a republic brave enough to es
tablish its government wherever the brav
ery and patriotism of the soldiers and
sailors carry Its flag.
"I want an Imperial republic thr.t feela
the awakening impulse of civilization;
that will throw its heart and strong arm
Into any country where there Is an Amer
ican citizen to be protected.
"I want a republic so Inspired by the de
votion of her brave sons and the zeal of
her virtuous daughters and so loyal to
the traditions of American life that she
will be brave enough, no matter upon
what soil, not to permit her flag to be
dragged back Into defeat."
Cheers greeted ths speaker's remarks.

It has surrendered Itself to despicable and

Ar.d It v.a? but shortly before that that one

Gf-nrso S. rtoutwell of Massachusettsâ a con
temporary of I,incoln. who had devoted himself
to the cause of Republicanism through youth,
through manhood and rip? old aee, standing
in the presence of the Liberty Congress as
sembled at Indianapolis, said:
It Is hut a few weeks since, in our own
State, a man prominent in business and finan
cial affairs, revolting against the new heresies
of the party in whose service the best years
o! his manhood had been consecrated wound
up an open letter with these simple but elo
quent words: "I shall vote for Bryan."
My Democratic friends, you who are arrayed
on one s-ide of this contest, be of pood cheer.
The slsns are propitious; the augury of the
future Is bright. Not a day passes but does
not bring poor] tidings promising- final triumph.
It Is but ris'it that we heard that one of the

The banners are flung to the

Under the other those hosts of free

devotion, in the principles of the
Declaration of Independence,
who still revere the teachings of the a^res
oi earlv days, and would shape thflr thoughts
pecordirir to the precepta of Washington, jef
fcrson and Franklin: who would not exchange
the rcTiubllc In which they and their children
were born for all the monarchies and em
pire?, with their attendant colonies, of ancient
or modern Europe, who look with pride upon
the flair as yet unstained by one s=insle act of
perfidy or national dishonor; who have learned
nt their mother's kr.ee, and with Klowlntr
chÂ»oks and kindling- ryes have recited / ln their
village school the story of our own revolution;
and who believe the bronzed Inhabitants of tho
I'hlliri'lpes may with an much rljrht mid as
much claim to human sympathy as the orator,
statesman and patriot of old Virginia exclaim,
"Oive me liberty or pive me death."
U Is. not my purpose to dwell longer on this
theme. Its Importance, its magnitude, must

Is there any logic by which to discriminate
between the two cares? No. We found both
peoples strupRlinR for their freedom. We ac

liberty would be their rc-word. If we now pur

view against the Filipinos what is our crime?
Measured by our own standard, r.djudjred by
the very utterances of our chief maKlstrate,
we stand for the first time In our history con

And now how do we propose to re

FORCEFUL SPEECH OF
EX-SENATOR WHITE
CALL HEADQUAETER5, SAN JOSE, Sept. 6.â One of the
best oratorical efforts it has ever been the fortune of delegates
to a California Democratic convention to listen to was the
speech delivered to-day by Ex-TJnited States Senator Stephen M.
White. It was a forceful review of the issues of the campaign and the
principles for which the party of Bryan is contending. The ex-Sena
tor was given an ovation when he appeared upon the platform, and 'the
speich throughout was frequently interrupted by applauss. He devoted
considerable time to an assault upon the so-called policy of imperialism
which he accused the Republican party of attempting to foist upon ths
American nation, and denounced the subjugation of an alien race as un-
American and not in accord with the traditions of a free people. The
trusts came in for a vigorous attack, and the other bones of contention
between the two political parties were treated in detail.
TJ DO not intend to attempt to detain you
h after the mfsrnlficerK presentation of the
! B Issues that have just been made. It would
bo folly for me to Intervene, but In view
of your invitation I cannot but thank you
for the compliment which you have Kiven raf.
Aftf-r listening to the eloquent periods of my
* distinguished friends. I cannot but recall the
great battles that were fought in tho CongrÂ»?s
of the United States with reference to threat
ened Imperialism. I regretted occupying a seat
In the f-erats chamber-that I was compelled
Â¦ to dissent from the views of the majority of
my associates, but I thought It better to be
a member of the minority and be right than
to Join the majority and be wrong. I trust
even those who do net perhaps follow my ad
vocacy will believe whether I am right or
whether I am wrong I am not afraid to say
what I think. (Cries of â¢â¢Qood.") What the
policy of the situation may have been, how
ever advantaeeous or disadvantageous to me.
I could not see, without a protest, a prostitu
tion of our banner of freedom.
I recognized that this banner was called
into life by the men who fought for liberty
and quality. I had seen it triumphant in bat
tic'. Dut I had read on the pages of human
history of the destruction of a people who were
moved by the temptations of empire,' who were
dl&loyal to the cause of freedom, and engaged
in the encroachments of robbery and tyranny,
and I could but feel it my duty to stand in
solemn protest asrainst the devoting of Ameri
can energy and American courage to an enter
prise which did not have my full or even par
tial concurrence. !
Commercialism in the War.
Sympathizing with those who were strug
gling for liberty, sympathizing with all men
who sought to raise 'themselves from position j
of degradation. I protested against the move
ment instituted by the Republican party. And
I now know that I was risrht. In all the ef
forts made nnd the professions of friendship
(Uttered one saw the means employed of divert
ing the attention from rectitude.- so that the
pockets of the favored few might be filled
for the rrlce of freedom. The war In which
vc were Involved' in the Philippine Islands,
I believed then, and I know now. was not
intended to give them freedom, but back of
it all was the promptings of the commercial
Instinct, festered by certain men who had cer
tain Interests, who used the banner of America
for their own selfish ends. I-ater on a dif
ferentiation was attempted between a ' colony
and a subject state, but I must be pardoned
If I fall to see it. And when we protest against
the colonial system we protest against that
system which the fathers of the republic
deemed to be inimical to right.
â¢'I know." said a revolutionary patriot, "of
no spectacle more sublime than that of a pow
erful nation knoelinsr before the altar of lib
erty and sacrificing there the like and p*sslon
for war." (Great applause.)
Rule of the Sword.
I abjure you. my friends, that these attempts
of Republicans have a certain effect. This
adoption of a colonial policy â this policy to rule
by the swordâ is antagonistic to the great
maxims which lie at the foundation pf this
republic, as exemplified by our constitution and
expressed by our Declaration of Independence.
During the life of our republic we have been
an example to the people of every land and we
have advocated freedom and virtue conjoined
as essential to true liberty. Protect your peo
ple not only against the foe who strikes with
the sword, but protect your people against the
incursions of incompetency and ignorance.
Teach them day by day the problems of life,
which are more nearly solved than heretofore.
Teach them day by day that education and In
telligence are becoming more and more essen
tial, and that If there ever was an hour in this
nation's history when they needed the calm,
sober, deliberate Judgment of an Intelligent
man that hour Is here to-day.
Let no man think that because some mer
chantc may make some money by trading
abroad to-day that the cause of human rleht
will be thereby preserved. Never did the the
ory of commercialism, so-called, make a na
tion truly great. We have an example of this
In. the ancient nation of mighty Home, and
should we ever. In this nation, come to that
state of mind where we seem happy in the
presence of fuffering deliberately wrought by
ourselves, not upon an Individual but upon a
nation: If tho destiny of this republic is to
implant the spirit of liberty among the nations
of the world; If its aspiration has been to ex
tend liberty and the cause of republican gov
ernmentâthe instant that the victories whlcn
they hAd won in the cause of liberty would be
turned to win victories In the case of oppres
sion, then the trend of this nation Is down
wardâthat moment they recede.
The American people are mighty
in that power which enables them to
hold the sword and conquer, but they
are mightier still in that spirit which
will not justify the perpetration of
crimes upon other liberty-loving peo
ple. If this republic is to endure, as
we hope and believe and pray she
may, she will endure by the adhesion
to the doctrines of those who brought
her into life, and who, in the midst of
poverty and distress, laid down these
maxims, which you read to-day as the
incarnation of written expresions of
liberty.
Â¦ -Build up your nation In the ways of peace:
develop her: let her be known throughout the
enrth not merely as a commercial natl-n.
training Its bodies of men or its navies but
let It N> understood that within her biund'arleg \
are contained the choicest pearls and Jewels
of freedomâ freedom.- not "license â freedom rov
ernc?' . 1 by law; freedom recognizing every riKht :
throughout the world.
They have said that the Democrats are cow
ards. I do not wish to make the ctatement as
It should be. but it would not take a lengthy
word to controvert it. Hut. my friends, the
man who adheres to principle and who win
in the presence of a demonstrative, great, un
i thinking mind, state his convictions fearlessly
is not a coward. He has the courage of his
convictions and the power to express thÂ°m ever
in the face of those who outnumber him and
who perhaps overpower him. Truth, we know,
cannot he crushed; for the time being It may
be subverted, but Its restriction Is as certain
as the promise of Immortality. This republic
was founded for the benefit not of one man.
It was founded for the benefit of the people of
the nation nnd for the' people of all the world I
whenever they choose to enjoy Us benefits ami I
blessings. It was founded not for a mere day.
but to last for all time.
The Republican System.
I have heard It said by men In high places
that the republican system will do In the days
when a nation is yourg. but when she becomes
broad . and gTeat then the mob must be.
kept down, the army Increased and the constl
tattoo modified. Such was not the theory of
the founders of this Government. Their theory
was that they could furnish enough men loyal
and true to republican principles to perpetuats
republicanism, and that It was not for a day.
not for an hour, but for all time that these
same, ritrhts should bÂ« conserved.
I would protect the name of my country and
the authority of my country's flap by following
the precepts of her founders and obeying the
letter of her constitution, and If this Is done
we would never make that banner the Instru
ment of tyranny nor of passion and Intimida
tion. To me it was evident when these propo
rtions were first advanced that the commercial
spirit purgested them; to me it was evident,
and I did not hesitate so to declare, that It
was not the intention of those in power to
give Cuba or-the Philippine Islands a free gov
ernment. I knew that It was designed to bring
them into such relation an might make It
profitable to the favored few.
Then the Republican protectionist
of California advocates the absorp
tion of the islands, and when we re
ferred to his inconsistency by saying 1
that if they are absorbed, our system
of protection should be extended over
them, we were met by a proposition
which seemed to me to be extraordi
nary at first, that we could adopt a
policy that giving them the blessings
of liberty would not give them the
blessings of a Republican tariff.
In other words, to divide the benefits which
must under the glorious folds of our constitu
tion accrue to those who are fr.rtunate enoush
to be within Its Jurisdiction, hut that the bless
ings of the tartrr belong to those who find It
profitable to raise peanuts and oranges.
Glaring Inconsistency.
Fellovr citizens, that Inconsistency la too
glaring to be overlooked by the intelligent
American voters. When our flag Is made to
stand for what Is unjust and unpatriotic, and
we sneak of the triumph of our armies* mag
nificent machinery' of destruction which we
have devised: and we speak in glowing terms
of the number of mm we have In our armies

It was all over: and we think of thÂ» lessons
It has conveyed and of the example that Is set
when we think that we have passed through
more than a century, constantly holding out
to the world tho benefits and glories of our
system: when we remember that we have upon
every Fourth of July told our children
throueh our orators, of this great liberty lov
ing nation and of thÂ« blessings It has brought
to all those who have been fortunate enough
to be included within Its boundaries-ar* w%Â»

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAN JOSE, Sept. G.â The address
of D. M. Delmas to-day at the afternoon session of the Demo

curred in the Sixth, where the South
ern Pacific Railroad had little diffi
culty in forcing the nomination of
"William C. Graves of San Luis

So thoroughly was the convention
dominated by men carrying Southern

CAM. HEADQUARTERS, SAX
JOSK, Sept. 6.â William C.
Crave? of San Luis Obispo
was nominated for Consrros^
by tho Slrcth Congressional
District Convention at the
Hotel Vendome to-night. The
vote stood: Graves 53, Rush
j 19, Adoock lii on the first ballot, and tho
nomination was thc-n made unanimous.
Thorr.as A. Rice of Ventura was nominat
ed for Presidential Elector.
The Congressional nominee Is a railroad
attorney and owe? his preferment mainly
to the support of twenty-four delegates
from Los Angclep, who came to the con
vention on Southern Pacific passes. Their
loader was Thomas McCaffrey, the South
ern Pacific train dispatcher at Los An
geles, and F. W. Allender was their chief
"spokesman. The delegates in their eager-'
nees to obey the orders of the railroad
politicians rode roughshod over the oppo
sition of Stephen* M. White, whom the
Democrats of the South call "the' be
loved." The former Senator made re
peated requests by telephone from th?
meeting room of the platform committee,
where he was kept by the work in hand,
to his friends In the district convention
that an adjournment be taken until to
morrow, that he might be present, but
1 the "little Giant" ran against the or
ganized forces of the Southern Pacific ami
his messages were turned aside in deri
sion. The railroad, men were determined
to force the nomination of Graves, and
had Stephen M. White listened to the so
licitations of General Otis and antl-rail
road men in the delegation and consented
to become a candidate himself he would
have suffered the humiliation of defeat.
*f=o completely was the district convention

FRESNO, Sept. 6.â Frank Browninff.
a young Englishman, in a fit of
madness to-day emptied both bar
rels of a shotgun at a Japanese em
ploye, mortally wounding him. He
then walked a quarter of a mife to a
powder-house and blew himself and the
building to atoms with dynamite. The
double tragedy took place on the orange
ranch of W. G. Uridge, near the little
town of Centerville.
This morning Browning went hunting
with a double-barreled shotgun and was
away for several hours. He returned to
the house at 2 o'clock and as he came up
behind the barn, fifty yards distant from
the house, he met one of the Japanese
laborers named Okonoro. Okonoro was
unloading a wagon and placing its con
tents in a bunkhouse. Browning walked
ui> on the Japanese from behind and when
within a few feet of him raised the gun
and fired. The first shot took effect in
the small of the back and the second shot
blew the victim's right arm off near the
shoulder blade. He died at 8 o'clock this
e> Brow1iing's sister and brother, who were
in the house, did not see what had taken
place but supposed the young man was
snooting at doves. After committing the
terrible crime Browning quietly entered
the house and put his gun away. He then
walked a auarter of a mile to \> ridges
power-house and went Into the building.
A few minutes later a terrific explosion
shook the country for miles ln every di
rection. Browning's brother and sister
rushed to the scene and found pieces of
the young man's body scattered among
the ruins of the building. The legs and
neld had been blown off and the trunk of
the body lay fifty- feet from the spot
where the power-house had stood. The
explosion sÂ£ook the town of Centerville
and frightened the inhabitants.
It is believed that Browning was men
tallv deranged when he committed his
awful crime. For several days he had
cnoken to his brother and sister about the
Japanese working on the ranch and his
language seemed to Indicate that he be
lieved they were conspiring against him.
"week ago his relatives suspected that
he was becoming mentally unbalanced
and prevailed upon him to go to San
Francisco, thinking a change of climate
and surroundings would do him good. As
soon as he arrived in San Francisco he
called upon Mr. Uridge. the owner of the
ranch, and began to tell the capitalist of
the conspiracv the Japanese had formed
against him. bridge decided that he was
crazv and paid no attention to him.
Brownin/ returned to the Centervi'.le
ranch where he was foreman, and en
tered into an agreement with his brother
to attend to his work for him. He saM
he did not feel capable of managing the
ranch any longer.
Browning had two brothers and a sister
livln^ in the neighborhood where the kill
ing took niace. They own considerable
property. "The young man was2S years

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAX
TA CRUZ, Sept. 6.â When the
nominations for electors at
large were declared in order D.
E. McKinlay of San Krancisco
in a brilliant addres3 placed
Samuel M. Shortridge In nom
ination for one of the coveted
honors. The name of Shortndjje was re
ceived with cheers and a series of hearty
seconding speeches v.-ere made from ilif
fertnt counties in the State. Mr. McKin
lay spoke as follows:
It gives me great pleasure to stand before
you to-c!ay for the purpese of nomlnaUnp; as
elector at Iarse one of the most prominent
citizens of California. We are entering at this
tlons are giving way. We find our Democratic
friends desert'n? the principles of IJryanism.
This will be a campaign of deep significance.
Wh<-n an administration such as William Mc-
Kinloy's can brins into line such names a.%
Fltzhuh Lee and Joe Wheeler it should be
supported. The questions of trusts and Impe
rialism and expansion arise, therefore we mun
recognize these great principles and place upon
our ticket one capable of understanding and
Bwaylng the judgment of tne people along these
new lines.
It was with great satisfaction that this con
vention listened to one v of the greatest ad
dresses ever delivered in the State of Califor
nia by or.e of our fellow Republicans. Samuel
M. Shortridse. I do not need to recapitulate hia
history. It has been known to this State since
he labored as a boy in the mines of Xevada
County. Â¦;*."-
If we place him at the head of our electoral
ticket he will go before the people and pay
just consideration to all parties and be a credit
to all parties. Therefore I submit his name to
you at this time.
Ti-ibutes to Shortridge.
Delegate Oliver of Los Angsles seconded
the nomination. He had no sooner finished
than Delegate Adams of El Dorado, a vet
eran, aroye and paid a splendid tribute to
the nominee.
And then Alameda County was heard
from in the pejson of Dr. George C. Par
dee, who said:
"Alameda County gladly, heartily and
unanimously seconds the nomination of
Sam Shortridge."
In order that the porthern part of the
State might not be unheard from State
Senator J. N. Gillette in behalf of Hum
boldt and other northern counties paid his
tribute, saying in part:
It Is with great pleasure at this time that I
rise on behalf of the northern part of thi3
State to second the nomination of the Hon. S.
M. Shortridge. We have watched his case for
years past and know him to be a true, earnest
and honest Republican. The speech made by
him yesterday satisfies our people that he is
worthy to lead In this coming campaign; that
the principles he enunciated are close to us.
With him in the frontâ with his earnestness and
bip heart, you may look for a large and rousing
majority for California, so that William Mc-
Klnley and the administration in the East can
extend their hand to us and say. well done
across the Rockies.
Eulogy of Barrett.
"When the enthusiasm for Shortridge
had subsided, when the delegates had
ceased their cheers and order was re
stored J. W. McKinley of Los Anpreles
arose to place another elector at large In
the field. He spoke of the commercial
world, of the nation ar.d of the need of
Riving It representation. He therefore
placod W. J. Barrett of Los Angeles in
nomination, saytng in part:
I douht nrÂ»t th<it even* m^mtver of this ccn
vention would he glad to rise in his place and
second the nomination of th? man who made
the brilliant oration we heard yesterday, but I
desire to plao<< In nomination another repre
sentative citizen of California. The Republican
party stands to-day, as It has always stood, tor
those principles which represent the prosperity
of the American people, the advancement of
business all over the United States and into the
uttermost parts of the world. That policy hai
bÂ«>en market! even more particularly In the ad
ministration that is just closinK. because under
it, we have cp.rripd our flag Into the distant
l>crtions of the world, and where our flas: goes
our trade- eoes with is. There is one class of
mon under the circumstances nf the present
campaign, taking- into cor.sideratlon the pros
prcts before us and the commercial history of
: our past, who particularly repres*nt this ex
tension of busine*. They are the commission
ers of trade. *
! They build up and make trade as they co
I forth on their commercial errands. AÂ» a reprÂ»>
i tentative of that class, I desire to present the
name of a consistent Republican from the
south. The county of Los Angeles and South
ern <*al;fornia desire to Â©resent the name of
William J. Barrett of Los Angeled for Presi
dential elector at large.
When he had finished and the cheers
which had responded to his words were
j silenced Frank D. Ryan of Sacramento
: obtained the floor to second the numina-
I tion. He said:
| On behalf of the representatives of the jrreat
! Sacramento Valley we greet our competitive

nomination of Mr. Barrett for elector on our

Again Alameda County Insisted on be

Knickerbocker, who seconded the nomina

This address concluded the nominating
and seconding spt-eches for Presidential

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SANTA
CRUZ, Sept. 6.â W. B. Lardner is the
Senatorial nominee of the Republican
party for the Fifth Senatorial District.
The convention In which he was nomi
nated vras one of the most interesting held
yesterday. When the convention as
sembled B. B. Deming of Placer was
eiected chairman, and A. L. Smith was
chosen as secretary. W. B. Lardner,
John M. Fulweiler and Charles A.
Bwieier were placed In nomination for the
coveted honor.
Several votes were taken, but In every
Instance they stood five for Lardner. four
for Fulweiler and one for Swlsler. It
was conceded that Placer should have the
nomination, and the delegates from El
Dorado sought to force from Placer an
expression of Its preference, the under
standing being that El Dorado would
then Indorse the candidate selected by
Placer. Placer, however, declined to Indi
cate its preference until several ballots
were taken, when El Dorado, tiring of
the contest, cast its five votes for Lard
ner, and he was made the nominee of the
convention.
An Interesting phase of the contest was
the successful battle waped by S. D Wood
for the Congressional nomination from the
Second District. The Influences which
were supporting E. A Forbes for Con
gress determined to deal a double blow
and defeat Lardner in his Senatorial as
pirations. Thf railroad does not llk<s
Lardner. as he has never b*en Pubservient
to Its interest?. It determined therefore
to throw Harold J. Power into the fight
against Lardner for the Senate.
The plot fortunately was discovered in
time and Lurdnor's friends came to his
assistance. Senator John F. Davis of
Amador was the first to discover the
scheme and with Dunlap he made a de
termined effort to defeat it. He was re
warded with a splendid success.

Fellow citizens, my side partner. Dr. Mc-
Lean, was thÂ« peatlcman who wrote the first
call of the Republican Convention which met
In this State and wa? the first Purveyor <^f the
I 'on of San FVancisco under Abe Lincoln.
Br. McLean Is Facetious.
Chairman Van Fleet in introducing Dr.
McLean of Alameda made the mistake ol
saying that h<? was a resident of San
Francisco, but the veteran would not bf
deprived "f 'he honor of bring a resident
of the hnnr.er county of the State. His
speech was a facetious one and created
laughter and applause. In part he said:
I am no: at young and spry as I have beenâ
as I was more than forty years a*p, when t!i?y
organized the Republican party in California.
It way my honorâ and I esteem it a Kreat
honor â to have written the oall which brought
The Republicans together !n the city of Sacra
r. ento to hold the Sn>t convention in this
Ftatp. which nominated delegates to eo to
Philadelphia, who afterward nominated Fre
mont, the first Kepu'uiican candidate for Pr^si
dÂ»nt of tin- I.'nited States. That was an honor,
and whilf I am not vain about ir I have a right
to be r>rÂ°ud.
Now. Mr. President, I came from a slave
Ptate. I made my home in Santa Or.iz In ISoO.
I had the honor to deliver the Fourth of July
cratien In tills city in 1850. The burden of
thct addrecp. although I came from a slave
State, was a oonrratu'.atlcn to the people of
California for determining- to make this a free
State, and we see the result in '"alKornia to
dayâffty years from that timÂ» when our pro-
Bcr.lt '-rs said that freedom should prevail and
nr-t slaver}' on this I'acific <'oast.
I have been to a number of convention* since
then, but I thought I mlpht die socn and I
arr, not *r"'!np to die unless a brit-k falls on my
hend. I expert to live to lie more than 100
years. I am well behaved and I live in a (rood
country. A m^n who is vr^ll behaved and ilves
In a pood country will live a lonp life. I
wanted to come to another convention and Â«o
I am here, and now think that we can all
cariÂ«r?Â«lulate ourselves that we had this honor
there as you have come hÂ»re. with the ex
pectation and certain knowlpjg- that the nomi

the second half of his lifetime he huiit and
hroupht under his administration over 10.000
miles of railroad and steamship lines covering
upward of 12,000 miles of ocean transportation,
the indomitable courage which he displayed in
overcoming great natural obstacles which
would have baffled ordinary men, building rail

valleys but across deserts which the explorer
had feared to traverse and over mountain
"As far as I know, the ijuestlon has not
been considered since Mr. Huntington's
death. Mr. Huntington and our firm al
ways agreed that the maintenance of the
property at the highest standard of ef
ficiency ought to be the chief object ! of
the management and that the Southern
Pacific Company ought not to begin pay
ing dividends until there seemed a reason
able certainty that they could be main

Asked as to the time when dividends
would begin, Mr. Speyer declined to say.

Mstlr.g of C. H. Tweed, J.-imes Speyer and

Speaking of the dispatch from San

been some difference of opinion between
the late Mr. Huntington nnd tho firm of

Was One of thÂ» Heaviest Producers in
Cripple Creek District but Now
Is Heavily in Debt.
DENVER, Colo.. Sept. 6.â Judgment on
default of $153,516 was taken in the Dis
trict Court to-day against the Victor Gold
Mining Company by David H. Moffatt on
notes given on March 23. 1900, bearing 10
per cent Interest. The Victor mine on
Bull Hill in Cripple Creek has been one
of the heaviest producers In that camp.
The company was organized in 1892 with
200,000 shares of a par value of $3 per
share. It has paid $1,155,000 in dividends.
In 1S96 D. H. Moffatt and Eben Smith
sold the controlling interest to a French
syndicate, which left the management to
them, and In 183S they sold much of the
remaining stock in their hands on the
Boston market for $8 a share. In 1&Â»S
Mr. Moffatt went out as president and "W
H. Breevort was elected. During that
year the company paid four dividends of
$100,000 each. N. H. Cone, manager
of the property, died last year and the
mine practically closed shipping. How
the heavy indebtedness was incurred has
not been divulged. It is said that there
are still large ore bodies in the mine and
probably steps will be taken by the stock
holders to save the property.

THOUSANDS OF SHEEP
KILLED BY CATTLEMEN
Herd Driven Over a High Precipice in Colorado
and the Entire Neighborhood
Is Up in Arms,
WALSENBURG, Colo., Sept 6.â Reports received from Sharpsdale, a
small town in Southern Colorado, near Mount Blanco, say that the
feud over the use of the range which' has long existed between cattle
men and sheepmen reached a climax this week, -when the cattlemen
drove 3000 sheep over a high precipice. The trouble has grown out of
the scarcity of water along the water courses. Where srrass silll remains the
sheep were pastured, and after they had once passed cattle refused to eat and
either died or became very poor.
The cattlemen rose in revolt and, taking horses, corraled about sow <?heÂ»p.
The sheepmen protested, but being unarmed they could do nothing. The sheep
were then driven down a narrow gulch, at the foot of which an ancient water
fall had hollowed out a pit over 200 feet deep. Faster and faster the maddened
animals ran, urged on by the shouts of the cowboys, until the lender paused at
the brink. The press behind him forced him over and the others followed. Somo
of the last, who fell on the bodies of the first, were not killed, but the majority
were killed. It is stated that the entire country has taken up arms.

The policy of expansion Is America's historic
:ollcv. We have annexed the Philippines ex
actly as we have annexed Hawaii. New Mexi
co and Alaska. Thoy are now part of Ameri
can territory Â«nd we have, no more right to
c'.ve them up than we have the right to re
store Hawaii to th? Kanaka queen, or to
nbnr.don Alaska to the Esquimaux. There Is
'not a particle of difference between the cases
We cannot fo back, first for the sake of the
islands themselves and next for the sake of
our own honor. The men who are makin"

Justification incite the Pioux and the Apache
tribes to outbreak against us on the. ground
that we l:nve no right to retain South Dakota

an even more shadowy and Intangible auallty
than the iniquitous "robber gold dollar."
which disturbed Mr. Bryan so much four years
â¢so. The regular army Is not nearly eo nu
merous, relatively to the whole, population, as
Is the New York police force relatively to the
population of New- York. Just at present we
have in the regular army as compared with
our population nine-tenths of a soldier to
even- 1000 of population. The increase of
militarism since the palmy days of Jefferson,
a century back. Is represented by exactly one
tenth of a soldier to every 1000 Inhabitants, and
the Increase to the danger of our Institutions
Is measured, therefore, by the amount of ty
ranny which is capable of being exercised by
one American In a uniform over 10,000 of Mb
follow citizens without uniform.
Mr. Bryan and his associates cannot gay
rnoueh about the "consent of the governed"
doctrire as apply to the Philippines. They
dtrelt upon the fact that_ "no man Is good
Una "and other Southern States, we see before
our eyes the process of the disfranchisement
of the necro. We Â«eÂ» before our eyr<< the
black man governed without his consent by the
white man. I'ntll our opponents have re.
mo""ed thÂ» beam from their own eyo. by np
:i1yir:r their "consent of the governed" doc
trine at horn*, let them hold their peace about
th> Tural bandits to whom their word's give
?rÂ«-Â»ih h*-art to shoot down our soldiers in the
tar Eastern archiTiclniro.
We have a right to insist upon both wisdom
and sincerity in the leaders of any party who
aiiea! for popular confidence. Now let us
pee if we can trust the wisdom of our pres
ent opponent* by comparing their prophecies
In '<â¢Â« with the actual events since.
Governor Roosevelt quoted many, ex
tracts from Mr. Bryan's speeches in 1S3S
concerning the effects of the s;old standard
snd asked his hearers to contrast actual
results with Mr. Bryan's prophecies. He
resumed:
In his speeches Mr. Bryan kept Insisting upon
the alleged fsct that money was growing
def rer: that under a gold standard it was hound
tf. continue to grow scarcer. Well, as a mat
ter of fact. Bn<1 thanks to our prosperity, there
!s more money in circulation per capita in the
I'r.lted S-tates to-day than ever before in the
history nf the country. On July 1 last the
circulation per capita was 126 50, an Increase
in circulation of $5 40 for every man, woman
and child in the country, as compared with
what it was on July 1. 1S9Â«. So Mr. Â»ryan'6
prophecy ha? been as wide of the mark in this
instance as in every other. The present year
is the first in which the two billion dollar mark
in circulation has ever heen parsed. In other
words, the increase of money in circulation has
kept pace, with the expanding industries and
commerce of the country and this Increase has
been predominately due to the condition of
prosperity produced by the gold standard; yet
Mr. FJryan, In his> Minneapolis speech of four
years aco. predicted that commerce would be
at a. standstill because gold would go out of
the country and that the issuing of lÂ«onds
would be necessary tc bring it back. Every
rinsle prediction he has made has been falsi
fied by the event.
Bryan a False Prophet.
Our opponents were as cock-sure about the
pold dollar beine a "robber dollar" four years
jtgo rs they are about what they are pleased
to term "militarism and imperialism" at the
present day. and their utterances mean no more
now than they meant then.
Mr. T.ryan 5eemÂ» at thÂ» moment uneasily con
scious that thÂ»Â»re is sorm thing very wrong with
his proposed financial policy; and talks very
little about it. bat he has definitely committed
hims-elf to it. and the various conventions that
nominnted him have reiterated their belief in
all lhÂ« absurd end exploded theories which
he championed four years ago. 1'nless our op
ponents ar<^ guilty of the grossest hypocrisy
they must, if th^y carry the election, immedi
ately Ftart in to revolutionize our whole finan
cial system ard begin a sfriep of experimenta
with our industrial well-being which could only
result In the most widespread disaster.
It Is a terrible and most lamentable truth
that our loldiera who are now facing death
In the Philippines are forced to recognize in
the Brranlstlc Democracy their most danger
ous foe. The bullets that slay our men in
Luzon are !nÂ«i>lred by the denouncers of
America here. No Tagal general, not AgulnaMo
himself, mn do fo much to prolong the fight
ing, can do oe much to increase the bloodshed
of American and Filipino nllke aÂ« has been done
by the Kansas City convention.
DETROIT. Sept. 6.â The first meeting
of Governor Roosevelt's Western
tour, which was held in the b'.pr
assembly room of the Detroit IJ^bt
Guard Armory to-niprht, was all
that the Governor's most ardent partisans
| could have <lt sired In point of attendance
j and enthusiasm. The floor and galleries
(of the great hall wore crowded. Many
I wore on the outside, unable to obtain scats
i or Ftandins room within hearing distance.
The Vice Presidential candidate received
a tremendously enthusiastic sreeting as
ho made his way up through one of tho
! side aisles. A large proportion of the
i nudifnee stood upon chairs and yelled
i frantically for "TecUly." It was with dif
! fioulty that the shouts could be .appeased
i r-r'i Kilence restored so as to permit the
| mertinp to proceed.
When Governor Roosevelt arose to
1 spoak the great crowd arose almost en
messe anÂ«I remained standing and shout
ing for some time. The Governor's speech
occupied about an hour in delivery and
was listened to throughout with thought
ful attention.
Governor Roosevelt gave the audience
an object lesson when he asserted that
our Eoldieu in the Philippines had less to
feai from any liody of armed bandits In
that country than they had to fear from
the principle.', of the Kansas City plat
form and the success cf the Democratic
ticket. Ho five numbers of the regu
lar army were present and asked them to
Btund up that the audience misfit .see
their tyrants. Five soldiers from the
Fourth Infantry at Fort Wayne, who oc
cupied front seats when thus addressed,
arose and were applauded. "Now." ex
claimed Governor Kooseyelt; "behold your
tyrants."
Soldiers Applauded.
The audience shouted with laughter.
""They :ire here," continued the Governor,
"rive soldiers to four thousand* people in
this audience, which is a larger percent
age of tyranny in this house than the per
rertase of the regular army bears to the
wj ble number of the people of. this coun
try."
Continuing. Governor Roosevelt said in
part:
In this campaign the issue of oversha^lowlnj;
Imoortasce is whether we shall continue or
abandon the Governmental policy which has
bnmefat this country t.> the highest pitch of
prosperity at home, and which has kept the
national Iionor unstained, both at home and
abroad. To deliberately endo the work would
be te> dishonor the national reputation ami to
throTv us into dreadful industrial chaos. The
Kai'.^is City rlatforr.i commits our opponents
t.-> a policy which nv-ans material disaster aii'1
moral i!i?Â£rrace; rrhich means a violent panic
In the busin.-Â«s world and therefore widespread
aod urotonsed misery among all our people;
which further mean* ur.st-ttlnf? the courts, the
violation of the nation's faith in financial mat
ters and the unworthy abandonment of our
dutr abroad. The nation that accepts euch
moral irinTit.les cannot live. It will rot to
d'^ath in the loathsome stew of Its own cor
ruption.
TT the American people are true to them
selves they must in the most unequivocal man
ner repudiate the t>opuli*tic and communistic
doctrines enunt-iated in the Kansas City plat
form exactly as they repudiated them in "9S.
The exis'.rnce of any consideralle party which
affirm* and reaffirms these doctrines is in Itself
a serious menace to the nation's moral and
rr.atcrinl welfare} and we have a right to
apr-eal to every far-sighted and patriotic man,
whate'. er his political a'f.liatlons in the past,
from no mattpr what section of the country
he comt-s. to ftand with us in this struggle for
national integrity.

BRYAN ENDS HIS TOUR
OF WEST VIRGINIA
Discusses the Statement That He
Secured the Ratification of the
Treaty With Spain.
WHEELINO, W. Va.. Sept. 6.â The tour
of West Virginia, which was begun last
Wednesday by \V. J. Bryan, was con
cluded to-day by a speech at this place.
He traveled from Doer Park by way of
Clarksbtirg anil Parkersburg to-day, mak
ing three speeches of length and two or
three informal talks at such places as St.
Mary's and Sisterville.
In West Virginia Mr. Bryan has made
all told six set speeches and a number of
briefer addresses and has had uniformly
large audiences. At the Parkersburg
meeting ex-Senator J. N. Camden pre
sided. He supported Palmer and Buckner
four years a^o. The speech at Parkers
burg was devoted almost exclusively to
the question of imperialism. Discussing
tho title to the Philippines, Mr. Bryan
asked:
"Who says the Lord gave them to us?"
To this a voice in the crowd responded,
"Mark Hanna."
This response elicited a shout, and Mr.
Bryan replied: "While I am not prepared
to deny that God does speak through the
human voice, I do think that when he
get? ready to speak to the American peo
ple he will choose some other mouthpiece
than Mr. Hanna."
He contended that under the Republican
scheme for the control of the Philippines
the pcoplr of those islands must neces
sarily become subjects, as they could not
be citizens under those plans, and there
was no place under a republican form of
government for a .subject. In this speech
Mr. Bryan discussed more fully than at
any time before -the charge that. he had
secured the ratification of the peace
troatv with Spain. On this question he
said:
I want tn call your attpntlon to an argument
thsl the Hfnuhlican party seems more fond
of making than It does of making aay other
in defense of Imperialism. The main argument
that I have been hearing lately in defense Of
imperir.llFm is that I help>*'l to ratify the treaty.
Reptiblicnra me t<x> much credit when
they say I secured the ratification of the treaty.
It seems to nie thru if I had to help the Presi
dent secure the ratification of the treaty that
closed the war the Republicans ouRlit to feel
more kindly toward me than they do. If your
rrerident and your party In authority in both
houfes could not get the treaty ratified with
out my heln. I am not such a bad man as you
thouerht. I have not yet found a single Sena
tor who hr;s publicly declared that he voted
for tlie treaty because I wanted him to, but
Sesfrttor Wellington has said he voted for the
treaty because the President asked him to
r.nd promised that the Philippines should not
be held permanently If the treaty was ratified.
eo that If you attempt to prove that I am
responsible for the treaty you cannot do it,
bat you can prove by Penator Wellington that
the treaty would not have been ratified but
for the riromise of your 1'resldent.
Whenever you hear a Republican say that I i
Rin responsible for the ratification of the treaty j
I want you to listen and see If he adds that
I also favored n resolution promising Independ
ence to the FU'T'inos and you will listen in
vain. The Republican who charges me with
helping to ratify that treaty is not honest
enoujrh to tell at the same time that I favored
a resolutlrn that would have prevented blood-
FhÂ«-<! In the Philippines and made the Filipino*
nur friends instead of our enemies.

The purpose of the establishment of na
tional headquarters as announced by Mr.
Tracey Is to conduct a campaign through
out the country, and especially in this
State, which will endeavor to defeat Mr.
Bryan. Mr. Tracey said: "Judging from
my observation and knowledge, my opin
ion Is that "5 per cent of the Gold Demo
crats of 1896 will vote for McKinley and
Roosevelt. The remaining 25 per cent will
vote for Mr. Bryan."

BERLIN; Sept. 6.â In political circles
here it is thought that a compromise will
be come to in regard to the evacuation
of Peking and that the main body of
troops will bo removed to Tientsin, but
the garrison left In Peking.
COMPROMISE EXPECTED
REGARDING EVACUATION
"Russia's purpose Is to get all foreign
troops ns quickly as possible out of China
and then to lay aside the mask and seize
the empire for herself. Her proposal is
an unfriendly act toward Germany, since
Count von YValdernee announced he would
never give an order to retreat."
The press continues a lively discussion
of the Russian proposal, the more plain
spoken papers pointing out that Russia's
motives are selfish. The Centrist organ,
the Cologne Volks Zeltunsr. says:
The withdrawal of the Russian and
American forces from Peking would, of
course, upset Germany's programme as
outlined in Count von Bulow's circular
of July 3 and would create a wholly novel
and much more difficult situation.
BERLIN*. Sept. 6.â Several dispatches
have arrived from Washington during
the last five days which have met
with various interpretations here. One of
these Is that the United States Govern
ment Intended to withdraw its troops
from Peking if Russia did the same. Of
ficial circles were slow to believe this,
however, although a short Washington
dispatch received to-daiy seems to confirm
It.
RUSSIA'S SCHEME SAID

The French gunboat Decidee and trans

the West River h.ivf been received of

DENIES THE INTERVIEW
I. n NDON. Sept. 7. 3:30 a. m. â Germany's
polite refusal to withdraw from Peking
is rmncnted upon with keen satisfaction
in London, and the hope is expressed that
l,<-, r ,i Salisbury will show similar firmness.
The British reply has not yet been form
ulated. IÂ»rd Salisbury desires to consult
with his colleagues, and baa notified the
Foreign Office of his intention to return
to lysr.don from the Continent early next
we. k. There !s little doubt, however, that
Germany's reply is the outcome of the
dipous^ion carried on during the last few
days between the European Cabinets, and
that the compromise policy of maintaining
the occupation of the capital but wlth
arawinK the grr-at<=>r part of the troops to

From Sh.inchni it is rumored that Japan

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON' HOTEL. "WASHINGTON, Sept. Râ France Is
the only nation that has thus far accepted without reserve Russia's pro
posal to withdraw from Peking. It is believed Japan will adopt the position
assumed by the United States. Great Britain's reply has not yet been made,
but the unofficial information received at the State Department' indicates that
phe views the situation in much the same light as does this Government. Ger
mir.y's reply, as announced this morning, declares her intention to remain, and
h<>r answer is identical with that made by Italy and Austria. With indications.
therefore, pointing to the unanimous desire of all the powers, with the exception.
of Russia and France, to remain in Peking, the administration is piving con
sideration to the next stpp that shall be taken. In fact, what is believed to be
a Cabinet meetinp was held to-night at the Couniry Club in a suburb of Washing
ton. Having taken the l*Â»ad from the outset to the entire satisfaction of all tha
Powers, it is considered good politics to he prepared to art immediately after
Japan, which will be the tinal power to make a reply to Russia. The dominant
feature cf the forthcoming note of this Government will be the necessity of
comj-iâ te harmony of action by the powers.
A hiph official said to-day that harmony is more important than any
specific line of action that shall be adrpted. It is not intended to withdraw
from Peking, but Russia's views are to be met half way. That is to say, the
proposal will he consideredâ and, in fact, it is hinted that a suggestion to the
same effect was embodied in the reply cf Germanyâ that each power reduce its
force in Peking to a limited number <jf men. the rest of the troops to be with
drawn to Tientsin. The Ministers can Rlso return to Tientsin, if it is considered
desirable, and open negotiations with the Chinese Government from that point.
The American proposition will therefore be a compromise and the authorities
ar*> hopeful thai it will suit Russia, which desires to entirely withdraw, and
Germany, which dr.*Â»s not propose to retire. In anti-German circles apprehen
sion has been expressed that the arrival of Count von Waldersee. with 211,00)
men at Peking:, would mean permanent occupation of the Chinese capital. By
UznitiriK the number of men to represent each nation, there will be no cause for
sjrj; apprehension.
AMERICA WILL MAKE A
COMPROMISE PROPOSITION
PEKING (date missing), via Tientsin, Au? 26;
Chefu, Sept. 3, and Shanghai, Sept 5.â Overtures to
ward peace negotiations with the a -lied Ministers have
been made by a few mandarins, but there is no prince
among them. The allied forces are hesitating to enter
the palace, fearing for the pre tige of the Chinese
Government, and that if the building were destroyed
and burned the government of the whole of Ch na
would fall on the powers, rendering partition inev
itable. This delay is encouraging the Boxers, who
have murdered two French soldiers in tie center cf
Peking.

Among the departures yesterday were
the Mail steamer China for the Orient
and the Kosmos liner Tanls for Ham
burg via Central and South American'
ports. In both instances the vessels had
to refuse cargo. The China, however,
carried a big crowd of passengers, while
the Tanus was not overburdened with
people bound for Kurope.
The China took away 116 cabin passen
gers and over a million In treasure. Many
of the cabin passengers are bound for
Honolulu, while the treasure is all for
China. Every cent of it will go into the
Hongkong banks, and John Bull will thus
get the full br-noiit cf Uncle Sam's gold.
Chief Engineer Ferguson of the China
lias gone East to superintend the building
of the engines for the new liner now on
the ways at Newport News for the Paci
fic Mail. His place was taken on the Mail
boat by Fred Hellant of the Peru.
The cargo of the Tanis was the most
varied ever taken out of San Francisco
for a voyage around the world. She car
ried wines for Central America, concen
trates for AntofoKasta, canned goods for
Chile and IVru and tallow, wine and oil
for Oormany, Franco and England. The
Tanis could not carry all the fnight of
fering, and another vessel has been put
on the berth to sail the latter part of the
month in order to handle the surplus
Among the Transports.
There was some trouble on the German
transport Samoa yesterday. The veÂ«=se!
is bring got ready to load horses and a
number of the striking millmen were put
to work at reduced wages. The Sh!p
Joinery" Association made a vigorous pro
test and laid the matter before the Ris-
Oon Iron Works, which has the contract
for the work. The iron works people raw
the reasonableness of the demand and
agreed to pay the extra wage. This docs
the ship joiners no good, as the striking
millmen hold the fort at $4 a day, w^ile
the ship joiners are nut of work and
grumbling. Nothing but union mill work
will be accepted on the Samoa.
The German steamer Eva arrived yes
terday from Kobe. Japan. She was to
have gone to Vancouver, B. C. to load
coal for Kiaocliau.but was diverted to this
port at the last moment. It now depends
upon the situation in China whether the
Eva koor to British Columbia or will load
horses and supplies here for the German
Government.
The United States transport Thomas will
dock at Folsovn street to-day and begin
loading for Manila. She sails on the luth

THE report of the Civil Service Commission for
the fir>t six months of its existence, which was
filed with the Mayor about a month ago, gives j
u< an interesting sumpfe of the growth so far of the j
:r.erit system of appointment to onice in this virgin !
soil. The salaries oi the Commissioners during the
period covered by the report amounted to $1800; that
of the chief examiner totaled $uoo, that of the clerk
$<>oo. and that of the stenographer $^75. The sta
tionery torn up by the commission and its employes
cost $671 9^. land the miscellaneous expenses
amounted to $192 15. So the total expenses of the
body for the fir;~t six months of its existence were |
$Â±$?T) 07.
The results achieved through this expenditure !
were as follows: Copyists appointed. 36; sewer
cleaners, 14; c Jcnog r aphers. 5; court stenographers,
4: ordinary clerks, oj?. Total. 151. Thirty-nine la
borers were appointed, but they were not examined.
having been selected lioin a list prepared by the com
mission in the order of registration.
At the rate of expenditure for the first six months
of its existence the Civil Service Commission will
cost the taxpayers about $9000 a year. The number
of appointments made to date will probably never be
exceeded in any year after all the municipal offices
have been filled with eligibles, since the duty of the
commission will then be merely to examine and cer
tify for vacancies. Since few office-holders die and
none resign, this duty can never be onerou<; nor irk
some. If the merit system established by the charter
is sufficiently strong to defeat the efforts of the poli
ticians to create vacancies, probably there will not be
twenty places a year to fill from the eligible lists.
The sole question tc be resolved by the taxpa3'ers,
therefore, is whether or not they desire to pay $9000
a year for the examination of applicants for municipal
office according to a system by which fitness is sup
posed to be ascertained and registered.
It must be admitted that Â«o far the commission has
not proved a howling success. One of its member?
:s openiy practicing politics with the power conferred
by the charter, and i:nother does not seem to care
what becomes oi the ment system so long as it do?s
tict bother him. But perhaps the reform has not
bctn tested sufficiently to justify passing judgment
upon it. In other states it has shown practical re
sults, and nationally it has cured manv patronage
abuses. In this city up to date it has given rise to
nothing except deep-laid plans to circun.vent and de
feat it. Th?Â« may indicate that the civil service soil
here is too new 10 be cultivated, or it may indicat;
that our politicians are wiser than they look.
One thing, however, may be set down as abso
lutely certain â the Civil Service Commission mu-c
ultimately yield resul'.s or suffer annihilation. In this
State the srenins of the commonwealth is against
r.bo:i>-hing ofTices. but it" is safe to say that the mo
ment public opinion manifests its opposition to this
commission the body will go bv the board. Our
politicians will never consent to the continuance of
a tax-catins? bureau so full of terror and menace as
the Civil Service Commission when it becomes ap
parent that the people desire it abolished.
There are two point* about. the present commission
which are not escaping observation. Probably as we
go along one of them will become more conspicuous.
There is no reason why Phelan Democrats should
stand high in all the examinations and secure the
offices in preference to other kinds of Democrats.
Nor is there any reason why colorless appointments
should be made in cues where the arithmetic, geog
raphy and penmanship prescribed have baffled the
Phelan Democrats. We do not say the results so izr
justify this criticism, but there are a large number of
Phelan Democrats ,in all the offices, and the public
v.-ill ti-ntch their fate with interest, especially the fate
of thoÂ«ic rejected by the Mayor to draw salaries tindc.r
the Board of Public Works.
The other point is that the Mayor is always master
of the" commission. Not only may he remove the
members at any time for cause, but ererv Mavor
hereafter tr. be elected will, during his term, get con
trol of the body by appointment, should he not pos
sejs sufficient nerve to dismiss the entire body imme
diately after taking office. Under all these facts, cir
cumstances <and tendencies it must be said that a
thorny road lies before civil service reform in San
Francisco. If any other good comes out of it save
the distribution annually among needy politicians of
$0000 we shall be .surprised, and shall Hasten to record
the fact and rejoice exceedingly.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM
Shortly after noon yesterday the gras3
just north of the golf links on the Pre
sidio reservation was found to be on tire.
An alarm was sounded and the newly or
ganized fire corps at the Presidio was
called out. Hundreds of soldiers answered
the summons, armed with sacks and old
blankets, and so vigorously did they at
tack the flames that the fire was soon un
der control, but not until it had spread
over two acres of ground and consumed
about fifty tine trees. The soldier liremen
under the leadership of Captain CaliS
showed exceptional skill in buttling with
the Humes; though they were greatly
handicapped by the primitive methods
they were compelled to use. Colonel
Rawles-has repeatedly a.Â«ked that the res
ervation be allowed a modern fire-fiijhung
apparatus, but has not been able to s<"eur<
tne consent of the department. In conse
quence the men are compelled to right
i;re with anything at. hand.
The volunteers at the Presidio are to be
discharged fri.m the service, an order to
this eflect having been received yester
day. There are at present a.sÂ»j convales
cent volunteers located at the Presidio,
Fort Mason and the post and general hos
pitals who will receive thtir discharges
by reason of this order. They will be sub
jected to a strict physical examination
and a cartful record made of their condi
tion, so that any future claims for pen
sions can be justly dealt with. This move
evidently means that the volunteer regi
ments will soon be returned and mustered
out.
A double quartet from the Bohemian
Club will entertain the sick soldiers in
the mess hall of the general hospital this
evening. The soldiers are very grateful
for attentions shown them and sp.-ak in
the warmest terms of the offer of the
club.
L-ieuteant A. M. Davis and a guard of
twenty carefully selected men will ro to
Alaska on the Lawton next Tuesday. It
Is expected that fully 700 indigent miners
nt Nome will return to this country on
the transport.
Colonel James M. Marshal left yester
day for Hanford to purchase cavalry
horses. He is accompanied by two em
ployes of the quartermaster's department.
The jurisdiction of the Justices' Court
came into question in a suit brought by
"Jake" Kauer apainst C. L- Wi!s=on and
the Bank of Antioch. which v^as on trial
in Justice of the Peace Cook's court yts
teraay. The r-uit is really directed against
the Lank, but Wilson la made co-defend
ant, as he was one of Its depositors and
issued checks drawn on the bank after
his deposit had become exhausted.
Rauer's ?uit 5s for 52S1. There are tw.*
others pending, in which ex-Attorney Gen
eral W. II. Hart sues for $290 ana A. Clark
for t275.
The point raised by defendants' attorney
was that the several acts on which the
action is based took place in Antioch ami
that jurisdiction was vested In the courts
of Contra Ccsta County. The matter wa-i
submitted on briefs and Judge Cook wul
render a decision in a few days.
K. Ilarkir.son. cashier of the Bank of
Antioch, testified that Wilson * has no
money now on deposit in the bank. A:
one time Wilson was manager of the Cal
ifornia Power Company at Antioch and
had on deposit about Â£"X>. Against this ac
count. Ilarkir.son said, Wilson drew time
checks payable to the order of men em
ployed by the company until his deposit
became exhausted. Wilson then issue-l
new checks for the' amounts mentioned,
and these wore afterward assigned on
promissory notes to Kauer, Hart and
Clark.
Kauer testified that his claim had beÂ°n
assigned to him by J. M. Macks. Jud?;^
Cook refused ti> allmv the question put to
Harkmson by W. S. Tinning, the bank's
attorney, b? tÂ» whether the money orig
inally on deposit in the bank belonged to
Wilson or the California Power Company,
nor would the Judge allow the question if
Wilson bad authorized the money to be
paid out on time checks.
Harktnsoa alleges that a conspiracy hai
been entered into whereby it Is expected
to fleece the Bank of Antioch.
'â¢The llrst intimation I had that such a
fchem" was on fnot." said Harkinson
after the trial, "was when I received a
telephone message while stopping at the
Occidental Hotel in this city recently. The
menace was from an individual who in
formed me that thoro was a plan on foot
to "do up" the lank and for me to look
out. My informant said that he wa-i
asked to go in on the job. but he had re
fused. The money to be sued for was
split up in three checks. s=o as to hrins
the cases for trial In the Justices' Court,
as it wp.s believed judgment could not be
obtained in th<Â« Superior Court. Wilson
was made a. codefettdant as a blind. sincÂ»
I no contract existed between him and thÂ«
! bank.
"It was on Wilson's express orders thnt
the money was paid nut. One day Wilson
came to me in great distress and told me
that tie had issued time checks to laborer.?
j employed by the company. He requested
! me to pay thorn out of the money or! dc
* posit to his credit, which was done. 1
learned later that these laborers fear!
; threatened him with bodily harm uniesb
j he paid their wages."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1900.
6
BY reason of the volubility with which Bout well,
Cockran, Schurz, Wellington and other self
styled anti-imperialists have been asserting" that
Bryan if elected could not disturb the tariff or the
currency, that question has become something of a
momentous issue in the East. It is a strange issue to
be raised by intelligent men when Bryan's record is
considered, for if Bryan were not sincere when he
declared that if the jilver plank of the Chicago plat
form were not expressly repeated in the Kansas City
platform he would not accept the nomination, then
he is rot sincere in anything, and not to be trusted
on any issue whatever.
By reason of the popular interest in the question
the Ne.v York Herald a few days ago undertook to
yet an expression upon it direct from Bryan himself.
A correspondent of the Herald called upon Bryan and
asked whether if elected President he would make
payment in silver upon all Government bonds that
upon their face call for payment in coin without a
sj.ecific requirement for gold. To that question,
which went directly to the point at issue, the answer
was, "Say that Mr. Bryan declines to be interviewed
on that subject." Further questioning along the
rame line brought out the reply from Bryan: "I will
discuss that question in my own time and my own
way."
Here is a plain case of dodging an important issue
cf the time. The much lauded champion of silver re
fuses to tell the people frankly what he will do for
silver should he be elected. The object of the dodge
is of course to hold the free silver vote and also that
of the gold standard opponents of the administration.
The dodge, however, is by no means adroit. In fact,
it is about as clumsy as cowardly. '
Fortunately the country does not need to consult
Bryan at this late day to learn what he would do if
in office. He has made too many declarations on that
point for any doubt to exist concerning it. In a let
ter on the subject to Schurz, published yesterday,
Secretary Gage pointed out the power which Bryan
ns President would have to disturb the currency, and
then by way of proving what Bryan would do in office
quoted from a speech made by Bryan in 1806 this
statement: "If there iÂ« any one who believes that the
gold standard is a good thing or that it mast be
maintained I warn him not to cast his vote for mi,
because I promise him it will not be maintained in
this country longer than I am able to get rid of it."
In a former letter upon the question Secretary
Gaee had said that if elected to the Presidency Bryan
could order his Secretary of the Treasury to make
payment in silver of all the public debt payable in coin
and for all current disbursements of the Government
as well, which amount from $1,500,000 to $1,750,000 a
day. That proposition Schurz had disputed, on the
ground that Congress would not permit him to do so.
Replying to that Secretary Gage says: "The proposi
tion that in ca c c of Mr. Bryan's election the present
Congressman tic his hands ?o that he cannot give
(.fleet to his expressed intention appears to me to be
fallacious. It would require new legislation by a
party whose policy would have been rejected by the
people through their last expression at the polls.
Further than this, the next session will expire by
operation of law on the 4th of March, 1901. The free
silver minority would be justified by their constitu
ents in using all the resources of dilatory procedure to
prevent such legislation, and against such tactics
affirmative legislation such as you suggest would be
probably impossible. Can any one doubt that Mr.
Bryan would urge action by his friends in Congress
to prevent the further strengthening of the policy
which he denounces as criminal?"
So the argument stands between Secretary Gage
and Mr. Schurz. In the meantime the public will
note that the one man who could answer the question
and settle it refuses to do so. Under such circum
stances a new issue is raisedâ that of the sincerity and
political honesty of Bryan. Is he a true champion of
silver or only a shifty demagogue?
As Bryan read his Labor day speech instead of
trusting to the inspiration of the occasion, it is evi
dent he has begun to understand there is such a tiling
as talking too much and saying the wrong thing.
NOW that the Republicans have named their can
didates for Congress in the various districts of
the State, the work of electing them should be
gin at once. All political experts are agreed that the
chief fight of the year is to be for control of the
House of Representatives. It is known that a good
many conservative Democrats who will not vote for
Bryan will support the Congressional candidate of
their party, and consequently it is by no means as
sured that the election of McKinlcy will carry with
it the election of a Republican majority of the House
of Representatives, while the election of Bryan would
be almost certainly accompanied by a Democratic
control of that branch of Congress.
There are many reasons why the Democrats will
make .the most vigorous efforts to capture the House.
In the first place they have little hope of electing?
Bryan, and feel that their only chance of checking a
sweeping Republican victory is by winning a major
ity of the Congressional districts. In the second
place the conservative elements of the party, per
ceiving it would be of no avail to try to defeat the re
nomination of Bryan, have combined to regain their
old ascendency in the party through the House of
Representatives. Accordingly in all parts of the
Union there has been a concerted movement among
them to nominate strong candidates in each district,
and it will probably be found that Democracy this
year will have in every State about the strongest Con
gressional ticket it can put forward.
There is one other element of danger in the fight.
which must not be overlooked, for while it is not
strong it may be sufficient in closely contested dis
tricts to turn the vote in favor of the opponents of the
administration. That element consists of the body of
sorehead Republicans who have not obtained from
the administration all they expected. Every adminis
tration necessarily disappoints the expectations of
some of its supporters, and among the disappointed
there are many who will permit their soreness to irri
tate them to the extent of inducing them to vote for
the opposition in the next contest.
Such are the forces which Republicans must p-e
| pare to fight in th^ Congressional districts in addi
i tion to the regular supporters of Bryan. There is
i nothing in the situation to discourage any one, but
J there is certainly enough of danger to render earnest
work imperative. Overconfidence will be nowhere
I more foolish this year than in Congressional dis
trict. In those contests Republicans can afford to
take no chances. It is there the enemy is going to
be strongest and most earnest, and accordingly it is
there Republicans must put forth their full strength
and exert it continuously until the polls close on
election day.
California cannot afford to be represented at Wash
ington by free traders and free silver men. All her
interests are on the side of protection and the gold
standard. Her delegation at the national capital
should be solid for prosperity and sound money. The
candidates nominated in each district are worthy of
the support of all true Republicans and of all inde
pendent citizens who desire to maintain the welfare
of the republic and the people. We have two Repub
licans in the Senate; let us now send to the. House
a solid Republican delegation to support the Senators
in all that tends to promote by national legislation
the prosperity of California and the Union.
The one thing in the Chinese situation that grinds
the powers is that the only dignitary they can reach
is Li Hung Chang and when it comes to diplomacy
he has a longer reach than any of them.
\A ISS SADIE AMERICAN of the Chicago
/ \ Woman's Club contributes to the current
number of the Merchants' Association Re
view an able plea for providing more ample play
grounds for the children of the city. The underlying
argument of the article is that juvenile crime is
largely due to misdirected energy resulting from a
lack of opportunity for the healthful and wholesome
exercise of the child's growing strength, and that
playgrounds will tend to moral as well as to physical
improvement.
Abram S. Hewitt of New York is quoted as say
ing in a report on the small parks of that city: "Im
provements of property have left children no other
opportunity for play than those that can be found in
the streets. It is impossible to use these for games
without incurring the interference of the police. A
sense of hostility between the children and the guar
dians of public order is thus engendered, leading to
the education of citizens who become enemies of law
and order. . . . With a common accord the pre
cinct captains attribute juvenile rowdyism and tur
bulence to the lack of a better playground than the
streets." Again, traffic of train and car causes many
accidents to life and limb. . . . London after an
experience of forty years battling with the slums says
tersely: Crime in our large cities is to a great ex
tent simply a question of athletics."
The importance of playgrounds to a community
was learned in London earlier than anywhere else,
and in that city the fust steps toward providing such
grounds were taken. Many have been the improvements
made in London of late, but none have been more
immediately beneficial than that of providing parks
and open spaces in the tenement districts for the re
creation of the children of the poor. For genera
tions the Cockney child has been a weak and puny
being, and the native Londoner was rarclv equal t r j
his fellow countrymen brought up in the country.
That reproach upon the citizen is now passing away,
and in a recent report on the subject it is noted that
of late the London youths have been able to compete
successfully at /cricket and other athletic games with
the country clubs.
Among the older cities of this country New York
and Boston have been foremost in adopting the new
method of dealing with the youth of the city. Boston
has provided for the establishment of two open air
gymnasiums, one in East Boston and one on the
banks of the Charles River. The Outdoor
Recreation League of New York has devised
a plan for making a playground at Seward
Park, in that city, which promises to be - a
model for future improvements of the kind.
The plan as described by the New York Post calls
for a depressed amphitheater, with ten rows of seats
at one end tapering to two or three rows at the
other. The seats are to be used for band concerts or
athletic tournaments. The main part of the park
contains a running track, ball grounds and a kinder
garten pavilion.
Miss American makes an effective point in her pica
for the establishment of similar playgrounds here by
saying: ''San Francisco, with a climate which makes
it possible to encourage outdoor life the greater part
of the year, has both a greater responsibility to sup
ply adequate outdoor spaces, which are the property
of its citizens, and a greater privilege in that its in
vestment must be a greater value, since it can be used
almost twice as long as that in the less favored East-
The plea is well made and the cause is good. It i<
to be hoped it will hnd a cordial response from all
who are interested in public welfare. While we are
making improvements in other directions, let us im
prove in this also.
WITH a zeal which we trust will speedily achieve
the object to which it is devoted, the Semper
virens Club is engaged in the work of raising
the sum of ?50,ooo for the purpose of saving the red
woods of the Big Basin of the Santa Cruz Moun
tains. It appears they arÂ« rinding much difficulty in
obtaining contributions just now because those who
would be likely to aid the enterprise are giving all
they can afford to the fund for the celebration of Ad
mission day. Such being the case, one of the mem
bers writes to The Call suggesting that a portion at
least of the money raised for the celebration be de
voted to the purchase of the Big Basin, so that the
great trees may be preserved as a memorial of the
patriotism of the Californians of this generation and
as a permanent park and pleasure ground for the
Californians of the future.
The plea of course comes too late to have any
effect upon the plans for employing the money raised
for the celebration of Admission day. Nevertheless
in the discussions of California's future that will take
piace during the celebration it will be well worth
while for all to give come consideration to the project
which the Scmpcrvirens Club has undertaken. Our
great trees are among the most notable of the natural
features of the State. They are almost as widely
famous as our gold mines. They rank among the
marvels of the continent, the wonders of the world.
Their destruction would be a loss which centuries oi
time could not make up]
Unfortunately that destruction is imminent. The
waste of our forests goes on with a rapidity that is
rppalling. Whatever can be done to check it should
be. done. It matters not on what ground the preser
vation of forests be urged, it is good. We may save
them for their beauty, for the distinction they con
fer upon the State, for their healthfulness as holiday
grounds or for purely scientific reasons drawn from
their relation to the water supply. It matters not
why we save them so long as we save them. To that
end it is to be hoped the patriotic fervor aroused by
the glorious celebration of Admission day will tend
tc help the Sempervirens Club in achieving the : work
it has undertaken.
By the annexation of the Transvaal the British hnye
merely provided a camping place and exercise ground
for a considerable number of their soldiers for a good
many years to come. It will be a long time before
the annexation will hold without bayonets.
It is high time for Republicans to shake off that
summer apathy and start into training for the walk
over.
Editor The Call: Our, the .people's,
music temple at Golden Gate Park is fin
ished and The Call is right Ui saying that
it is one of the finest, if not the finest,
structure of Its kind in the world. It js
magnificent to look at, but Its inspiration
is of the dumb kind.
This beautiful temple does not, with all
Its expressive grandeur, speak out to the
beholder as It should; in other words, it
does not. as It shouid. ring to heaven
with some lofty inscription written' on
the bare and empty space ftr balustrade
above the so-called entablature.
A few chiseled words, be they a quo
tation from some Immortal author or poet
or an> original inscription to suit the oc
casion, would make of this silent temple
a living, breathing structure, reminding
one, even when no music peals forth from
its graceful vault, of its high mission in
public life, and emphasizing the splendid
munificence of the donor.
Could it be that the designer overlooked
this Important feature of the building and
never thought of the beauty of an In
scription? If that be the case could not
The Call agitate the question by submit
ting the selection of an inscription to tne
public? , ,
Suggestions will readily come and from
the large mass of ideas some inscription
could be selected that would suit the pur
pose. Or in the event that this seemed
infeasible could not C'laus Spreekels be
importuned to suggest some appropriate
inscription?
I sincerely hone that my suggestion will
not altogether be lost.

LOSES AN EAR LOBE IN
DUEL WITH REVOLVERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
, OVELO. Sept. 6.â News of an extraordinarily fortunate shooting affray
(I was received here to-night. The principals, T. J. Crowley and Harry
(v j Beard > exchanged in all fifteen shots. Crowley lost the lobe of an ear
v^^^ and a horse and Beard escaped unscathed.
Crowley, accompanied by his daughter and a guest. Dr. Jarvis of
Oakland, was riding over his range when he discovered a grass fire raging.
He believed it was started by some enemy, and later, meeting a neighboring
rancher named Harry Beard near the scene, he ordered him off the range.
Beard drew his revolver and commenced firing. The first shot struck
Cfowley's horse and the second shot clipped the lobe off Crowley's ear.
Beard continued firing until his revolver was empty. Crowley claims to have
fired but one shot. ..; Â¦_; Â¦
After Beard had emptied his revolver he galloped away. On the road
home the Crowley party passed an old cabin, in the door of which Beard
was seated. Beard leveled a Winchester and shot four more times, and
Crowley took refuge In the timber. Crowley swore out a warrant to-day for
Board'B. arrest on a charge of assault with a" deadly weapon to commit mur
der. Excitement is high, and the examination on Saturday la expected to
bring out sensational details.

SEATTLE._Sept. 6.â 'Whether the earthguake disturbances which were

Bertha lent night, a vast amount of damage was done at the latter
place. In addition five Indians are known to have been killed.
The news was brought from Lituya Bay to Takutat by Indians in ca
noes. The disturbances there occurred on August 11. one day after the earth
quake Bhock.8 referred to. They apparently proceeded from the district in
which Mount St. Ellas and Mount Falrweather"are situated.
On August 11 two heavy shocks were felt, according to the Indians. The
eecond shock created great havoc, as well an destroying five lives. The In
dians told persons at Yakutat that five of the immense glaciers which head
Into Lituya were destroyed by the disturbance and were sent crashing into
the bay, pertly filling It with great mountains of ice.
The five Indians are reported to have been killed on a small Island situ
ated about a mile from the face of one of the glaciers. They were in a cave
and were drowned by the rush of water which swept over the island when
the Ice rivers crashed into tho bay. Chief George, onte of the best known
characters in the north/was one of the drowned Indians.

SENSATION AT HARTFORD.
Prince Alert Either Pulled or in Dis
tress at End of Fast Heat.
HARTFORD. Conn., Sept. 6.â The Grand
Circuit racing to-day was sensational in
one feature. Prince Alert, one of the
three starters in the free-for-all pace, af
ter making a half in 1:00?;, came in at
the -wire either held by "Walker, who was
up, or in distress, taking second place.
The odds were &0 to $10 on the horse and
the bets were declared off by the judges
on the supposition that "Walker held the
horse. "Walker drew the horse In the
second heat and explained that Prince
Alert came down the stretch suffering:
from blind staggers and that he was
obliged to bleed him as soon as ho left
his peat. Veterinary surgeons were sent
for to examine the horse and the judges
reserved their decision as to Walker's
culpability until the evidence is, all in.
Bets were also declared off in the second
heat before starting, and ten minutes
was allowed to make a new book, which
was in favor of Indiana. The talent
was badly upset by the occurrence,
as the short end had big money in
sight. Indiana took a new mark in the
second heatâ 2:04%.
Lady Geraldlne took: the consolation
purse of $800 offered for those outside of
the Charter Oak stake money Monday.
She broke badly in the second heat, but
was driven from the outset to win. York
Boy was the favorite, but took a fourth
and fifth only.
Major Greer was not headed in the 2:27
trot and won in three straight heats.
The 2:10 pace was unfinished, three heats
being- paced, two going to The Admiral
and one to Paul Revere. A heavy thun

LAKEPORT. Sept. 6. â Curtis Thompson of Lakeport and the Misses Emma
and NeHi? Hcr.dcr?rn of Upper Lake are congratulating themselves upon
a very, narrow escape from death. They were returning to Upper Lake
in a bugg:y from the cricket festival at the summer home of Mr. and Mrs.
C. M. Hammond. As they were descending a hill on a eteep grade over
lockinr Clear Ixko one of the holdback straps broke and the horse, taking
frlpht. ran away. â¢
Mr. Thompson and Miss Nellie Henderson were thrown out, leaving Miss
Emma In the bui?g-y alone and without the slightest means of controlling: the
horse, as the lines had fallen out. She dared not Jump, but her quick wit booh
suggested a plan that not many would have attempted.
Waiting- until a comparatively smooth piere of road was reached, she stood
tip and jumped for the crossbar of the shafts. The dashboard had been kicked
away and she lar.ded safely. Another leap placed her on the horse's back. Cling
ing- to the harness with one hand, she sc-cured one of the lines with the other and
soon reined the horse into a fence, bringing him to a standstill.
The two others narrowly escaped going over the grade and were badly bruised
but not seriously injured. \

SACRAMENTO. SepL 6.â The fourth
day of the meeting at Agricultural Park
drew the largest crowd of the week, there
being a regular crush in the betting ring.
The programme wore a classy look and
the sDort was far above the ordinary.
"With two exceptions favorites carried off
the laurels and the bookies retired with
crape on their hats.
Beyond peradventurs of a doubt the
highest honors rested with the sidewinder
Kelly Briggs and his driver, Sam Hoy.
The crack pacer went through his field
In the 2:11 class as a Mauser bullet would
pierce a baseball player's chest protector,
not being compelled to step below 2:ll',i.
In the betting he was a top-heavy favor
ite. Drawing a poor position for the first
heat. Hoy trailed his field, merely drop
ping along at tire end to get a few hole*
closer to the pole. Myrtha Whips winning
from" I Direct and Edna K in 2:U^i. After
this the lirst choice rang up three bulls
eyes in succession and the game waa over.
Too much praise cannot be bestowed
upon Charles E. Clark, the clever Fresno
reinsman. for his superb handling of El
Moro, victor in the 2:15 class trot, after
a spirited five-heat contest. The talent
early picked Alta Vela to win this event,
and in the betting he sold favorite. After
twice finishing third and once sixth Driver
Nelson askeu the judges to excuse his
horse, which request was granted, owing
to an ailment. The greatest finish of the
race was reserved for the tifth and de
ciding heat. El Moro' at once went out
in the lead, with the dangerous Arrow in
close attendance. In a long drive from
the quarter pole home, both horses being
extended to their utmost and both break
ing shortly before the wire was reached.
El Moro earned the verdict by a head,
his driver receiving an ovation on return
ing to the stand.
The Dewey selling stake attracted a
field of six to the post. Torslna closing- an
8 to 5 favorite, with Mounee In the saddie.
Formero, which opttied in the betting
equal choice with Gill Summers' mare,
receded to 13 to 5. Starter Reagan sent
the bunch away nicely aligned, with
Mounee at once taking his mount to the
front. Torsina set a very warm clip, and
holding Formero safe the last part won by
three lengths In l:2t> 1 i. Ruiz let the Sink
entry fall too far out of It the first part.
Jennie Keid was a tired third.
Narra G. an extensively backed favorite,
downed a bunch of nine maiden two-year
olds of low </iliber. closing a 6 to 5 char.ee.
Tlollta took the place from George Dewey.
Right up on ct'.pe and apparently as
good as ever. Mocorito met easy game in
the six furlong jaunt, decided under sell-
Ing conditions. Under restraint to the
stretch, she collared and led Amasa past
the judges by six lengths.
Walter Hobart had the pleasure of see
ing the Southern California pony Viola
defeat his Slats in the half-mile dash,
each to carry 110 pounds, with six start-
Ing Slats, with H. Shields up. war a hot
favorite. After leading to the paddock
she quit and was beaten six length* in :43.
By the way, all the little differences ex
isting among the gentlemen riders and
polo players have been amicably adjusted.
Tom Drlscoll. Dick Tobln, Cyril Tobin
and other crack players will be up to
morrow with their ponies and the first of
a series of three games will be played on
the infield Saturday morning. Summaries:

EASY WINNER
OF THE PACE
Special Dlsratch to The CalL
FOLSOM, Sept. 6. â Officers who have
been trying 1 to ferret out the murderers
of Hans Rasmussen and William Taylor
have found a clew upon which to work.
Lou Page, a rancher, who formerly lived
here, but is now a resident of Nevada
County, saw a man leaving the Perazzo
place on Friday, gclr.g cast. Page had
driven down from his Xevada County
ranch and was stopping near Mormon
Island. On Friday morning he left there
at 9 o'clock to go to the residence of J. T.
Silberhorn. In passing the Perazzo place
he sav.- a man leaving the ranch and
striking out across country in an easterly
direction. This man he has since identi
fied as John Lynch, who, like the mur
dered men, has charge of one of the
dairies in the absence of the owner. He Is
positive in his identification.
Lynch, whose full name is J. F. A.
Lynch, has been here since last Decem
ber. He Is a man of small stature, middle
age and has been a crlpde for some
years, having nearly lost tne use of his
right arm. Very little is known of the
la-st few years of Lynch" s life.
What makes suspicions doubly strong
Is the fact that Page saw Lynch leaving
the Perazzo ranch on Friday morning,
and the opinions of all who have worked
on the case are that the crime was com
mitted either Thursday night or Friday
morning. S. A. French, who lives near
the Perazzo place, claims to have ween
the murdered man on Thursday after
noon.
Pag-e went with Constable Donelly this
morning to the Woodard ranch and pos
itively Identified Lynch as the man he
saw leaving Perazzo's place. The dis
tance from Perazzo's place to the Wood
ard place is about two miles and from the
Woodard place to the Carpenter place
about a mile.
Lynch is considered to be an eccentric
and of a low order of intelligence. He is
being- watched pending further investiga
tion. Pagre lived here for a number of
years and 1b highly thought of.
Suspect Is a Cripple and Has Been
Seen Regarded as Eccentric
and of a Low Order of
Intelligence.
Identified as a Man Who Departed From
the Plata Soon After Grimes
Were Committed.

MISS EMMA HENDERSON.
THE LATE REV. LORENZO WAUGH.
WILLIAMS, Cal... Sept. 5.â Rev. Lorenzo TTaugh. well known through
out California, arrived here en the ncrth-bound train at noon to-day
in company with his daughter-in-lav.-, to whose home, a few mllea
west of here, he was going for the benefit of his health. He alighted
from the train and walked Into the waiting-room at the depot, where
he sat down and in a few minutes breathed his lost.
The reverend gentleman was very feeble, having celebrated his ninety-second
birthday at IVtaluma on August 8 last.He was known as the "Father of the
Band of Hope" In California.
The body was convoyed to an undertaking establishment and prepared for
shipment to his old home in Petaluma.
The Rev. Lorenzo Waugh, or, aa he has long been affectionately called,
"Father Waugh." was the oldest minister in the Methodist church throughout
the world, and had perhaps seen more years of ministerial service than any
other man in the United States.
He whs born on August 28, 1S0S. on the banks of the Greenbrier River, in what
is now Pocahontas County, West Virginia, and entered the ministry at the age of
24 years, sixty-eight years ago. His father was a soldier of the war of 1S12, and
he was the oldest of twelve children. He labored for some time in his own State
and then moved to Missouri, where he worked among the Shawnee Indians un
til 1S52, when he came over the plains In an ox train to California.
On his arrival he was met by General Vallejo, who was so favorably im
pressed with him that he made him a gift of 320 acres of land in Sonoma County,
where he took up his residence and lived for a number of years.
"Father \Vaugrh" organized in 1S59 what was known as the California Youths'
Association, which was a power in building up the Methodist church on the Pa
cific Coast.
For some years past "Father Waugh's" birthday has been an occasion of
celebration at the Howard-street Methodist Church in this city, when he has gen
erally been present. Feebleness of body, due to old age, compelled him a few
years ago to leave the northern counties and seek the milder climate of Los 011
vos, Santa Barbara County, but to the laat his mental faculties was as bright
and active as ever.

FROM COUNTY COMMITTEE
/! f=^ J KOROE DE FOREST RICHARDS.
U<5ov<>rnor of Wyoming, arrived in
the city yesterday and is at the
Occidental; H*Â» is accompanied by
Adjutant General Frank II. Stizen, Colonel
A. P. Hanson and wife. Major Thomas
Wilhelm. Captain P. Covert and wife ana
Captain Patrick Sullivan, constituting his
staff, and Miss H. Warren and n;ald. MIf.s
Warren is the daup-hter of United States
Senator Warren of Wyoming and cornea
here with Governor Richards to christen
the great battleship Wyoming, whteh Is
to be launched frcm the Union Iron works
to-morrow morning.
Governor Richards is a close student ot
the political conditions existing in the sec
tion of country lying between the great
prairies and the Pacific slÂ«>pe. and what he
has to eay resrardir.f? the situation in that
part of the country pertaining: to the Pres
idential election will not be pleasant read-
Ing for William Jennings Bryan or his fol
lowers.
. "The re has been a remarkable change
of political views in the inter-mountain
States during the past iour years," said
Governor Richards last evening. "The
most striking revulsion of sentiment has
developed within the last two years, and
Bt the present tim<? the anti-Bryan ele
ment is growing with astnundini? rapidity.
Four years ngo Mr. Bryan made a clean,
decisive sweep of the mountain States.
and everything was 'free silver. 1<> to 1.'
Two years afro I headed the hopeless Re
publican ticket atrainst the KrÂ«-at Bryan
majority of the two years previous and
carried the State with a good, comfortable
majority, every candidate on the Repub
lican ticket bc-iner elected.
"T'tah and Idaho will swfnp into the Re
publican line In good shape, and I would
not be surprised if Montana voters recov
ered their senses and adopted the same
course. Kansas will give a tremendous
majority for McKlnley. The farmers of
that preat State have never before l>een
so prosperous, and they are not looking
for a rh;mge cf conditions. The mort
gages they were compelled to place on
their properties under the Democratic ad
ministration have been paid off and they
now have money in the hank. Why should
they not stay with the party that brought
them prosperity? Colorado is good guesn
ingr ground, and I have a Â¦wager of $300
to $*j0 that McKlnley will pet the electoral
vote. My reasons for so thinking are that
inf '96 Bryan carried the State by 140,000,
and two years ago 4 .iis plurality was
pulled down to 40.000. The wonderful
growth of McKlnley clubs throughout the
State and the rush of voter? to join them
leads me to think that it will not be so
difficult to overcome that latter plurality.
I have many prominent political friends
in Nebraska, and they have the courage to
say that they think Bryan will be beaten
in his own State, and that if he wins it
will be by a majority that will be a hu
miliation. However, I am not so sanguine
as all that, notwithstanding he has to go
apainst the splendid bupiness conditions
that have been developed under the Mc-
Kinley administration.
"The OopIioI trud in Kentucky may cn<<t
up that State, and we may lose Maryland,
but the ir.ter-mountain States will more
than offset any such losses. "We had a
majority of ninety-six in the electoral col
)cÂ£r> four years ago, and 1 do not think
that figure will be reduced. In other
words. I am most confident that William
McKlnley will be the next President and
that we will have four years more of gen
uine prosperity. If the voters of the coun
try have any semblance of brains left they
will not place a mnn who has ever been
n conpiFtent :Â»rtd thorough business and
professional failure at the holm to guide
the destinies of so ,000 ,000 people, and they
will not do it."

September 5. .Superintendent "Webster
signed the demand as he believed that
Knowlton was illegally- displaced. The
board also sent \Veb.Â«tnr the demand of
Selden Sturgis for August, he having
been transferred from the John Swett
School and assigned to the Everett dur
ing Knowlton's temporary suspension.
Webster refused to sign Sturgis' demand
and also that of Mrs. Bigelow. who was
nsslgned to The vice prlncipalshlp of the
John Swett School in Pturgis' place.
ings, as he declined to enter upon any re
buttal of alleged charges, which he as
serted have no legal existence or status
under the law until the Superintendent of
Schools has created them. He therefore
Â¦withdrew from any prop .-sed investisnt on
or trial not authorized by the law. lie,
however, rend a statement in reply to
Mrs. Banning's report, which wa? aiso
read. In it she spraks favorably of the
quality of instruction piv<>n by Knowitnn,
of his punctuality, regularity of attend
ance and of the appearance of written
work presented for imitation by his pu
pils. To offset these qualifications Mrs.
Banning stated that Knowlton did not
hold pupils responsible for work assigned;
that the written homework was not col
lected for day3 at a time and when col
lected was frequently not examined at all,
or in a cursory manner: that the course
of ptudy was not carefully followed, the
study of drawing having been entirely
omitted during the present year; that in
oral recitation Knowlton poured forth a
constant stream of information, come of it
valuable but much that was irrelevant,
relating largely to his personal expe
riences and to subjects not fit for discus
sion in the schoolroom; that Knowkon's
records of pupils' work seemed to be based
entirely on dally recitations, on estimates
of ability and not of actual performance.
Knowlton then read his reply, in which
he denied the allegations made by Mrs.
Rannlng. In his plea that the board had
no jurisdiction Knowlton said:
"Although in the presence of a body
whose senior ciember plainly and publicly
announced no longer ago than yesterday
that 'this body is a law unto itself and
makes its own rules.' the respondent ven
tures to call its attention to a Supreme
Court report, which says that 'rules
adopted by the Board of Education can
not control the provisions of the statute
and are immaterial in determining the
statutory rights of the teacher.' "
Denmon took exception to the first part ;
ot the remark and springing excitedly to
his feet declared that he had never made
the statement that the board was "a law
unto itself."
"I took it down verbatim In shorthand."
retorted Knowlton, "mid I dare you ro
deny it." (
Knowlton then statÂ«d that the board
had no just statutory ground of suspen
sion; that the report made no charges of
Incompetency, though this was assigned
as the cause of suspension in the chair
man's notice; that no legal power or au
thority decreed the .-juspension; that th*-
Supreme Court forbad^ such suspension
by such authority; that, though the prin
cipal's "unsatisfactory " report was dated
June 20, U00, Knowlton was not notltled
of it until July 2S. Knowlton then asked
that the board revoke or rescind his sus
pension.
The board declined to do po, but was
apparently doubtful us to the proper
method of procedure and went into exec
utive session to talk It over. Superin
tendent "Webster contended that the board
had no legal right to try Knowlton and
that he alone was clothed with power to
formulate charges against a teacher. The
board thought otherwise and began its
open session by putting Mrs. Banning on
the stand. She testified that she had re
lieved Knowlton because he had mixed
classes by sending children weekly Into
other classes. . After hife class was re
duced he made no effort to teach draw
ing. She identified a package of drawing
cards which it is alleged Knowlton had
Indorsed as the work of his class to b(>
the work of the previous year. Knowlton
attempted to deny that he had so in
dorsed the papers, but ns he had with
drawn from the case he was not permit
ted to reply. The matter was then taken
under advisement.
A peculiar fa^t in connection with the
Knowlton suspension was uncovered by
Superintendent "Webster. Knowlton's sai
nry demand of $125 as vice principal of
the Everett School 'or August was al
lowed by the hoard as his suspension by
Chairman Mark was not confirmed until
Charges Are Heard, Notwithstanding
Superintendent Webster's Claim
That Directors Have No -
Jurisdiction.
The Board of Education took up the
consideration yesterday of the unfavor
able report fllpd against Vice Principal
Knowlton by Mrs. Banning, principal of
the Everett Grammar School, which re
sulted ln the former's temporary suspen
sion.
After a two hours" session, which was
principally devoted to the cross-examina
tion of Mrs. Banning, the board took the
matter under advisement and after hold
ing an executive session will announce its
decision in a few days. Knowlton was
present but took no part in the proceed-

DECISION IS WITHHELD
IN MISS SIMPSON'S CASE
Women Who It Is Alleged Heard the
Nursa Say She Gave McCor
mick a Hing.
Judge Conlan did not give his decision
yesterday in the case of Miss Mae Simp
son, the nurse, accused of having robbed
the late Mrs. Jean La Roche of diamonds
and jewelery valued at $750. Miss Simp
son's hearing occurred Wednesday and
at Its close the Judge stated that he
would be ready to announce his finding on
Thursday, but soon after the case was
called yesterday it was given out ; thac
there would be still another"? postpone
ment. No reason was given by' the court,
but It leaked *out that the defense hopes
to foe able to locate the rest of the miss-
Ing jewelry and have It ready when the
case comes up to-day.
When the postponement was made thu
story circulated some time ago to the ef
fect that Miss Simpson had told two fe
male acquaintances she had given a dia
mond ring to Deputy Coroner McCor
mick again became subject for gossip.
The women to whom it is alleged this
statement was made are Mrs. S. Wilson
of 'jO6 Market street and Mrs. Margaret
Rensler of 837 Mission street. Both
women, when seen yesterday afternoon,
refused to either corroborate or deny the
story. "I have nothing to say to the
newspapers." said Mrs. Wilson.
"I am sure I cannot account for such an
absurd story," said Miss Simpson. The
jewelry was given me by Mrs. La Roche
before her death in return for my ser
vices as a nurse.
"If I knew who had that missing dia
mond ring I would not hesitate to tell the
police or, anybody else Interested. Why
should I give Mr. McCormick jewelry. or
anything else? He is nothing to me. I
know many things about Mrs. La Roche
which I do not propose shall be made
public. She was a good friend to me.
That accounts for some of my contra
dictory stories. But If these other peo
ple don't mind their own business and
stop trying to Injure me I may say some
thing that will be not altogether to their
likine."

ing received a ring from Miss Simpson

Pyrotechnic Portrait of the Club's
President and the Emblem
Features of the Evening.
Pain's "Battle of San Juan Hill" was
Â¦witnessed by an immense crowd last
night. The evening's performance was
dedicated to the Olympic Club, and in
honor of the event a Hery- winged "O" and
a portrait of William Greer Harrison in
blazing colors formed part of the pro
gramme. A great many members of the
club were present and showed their ap
preciation of the spectacle by prolonged
applause.
Prom the time of the capture and exe
cution of the Cuban spies to the storming
and final capture of the blockhouse on Sari
Juan Hill interest in the performance
never flagged. Beautiful combinations of
colors were formed in the skies, accom
panied by the reports of hundreds of ex
ploding rockets and immense bombs. The
specialties of the acrobats were all up to
date, and the "man of fire," who per
formed astonishing feats on the parallel
bars, was the cause of much laughter.
To-night will be children's night, when
the special features of the fireworks dis
play will be devoted to young America.
A walking pyrotechnic elephant will be
one cf the novelties.

With Some Companions.
J. R. Curtis, a student, was robbed of a
valuable diamond pin while in the gym
nasium of the university at Berkeley yes
terday. Curtis with several other stu
dents was exercising in the gymnasium,
when some thief opened his locker and
abstracted the diamond pin from his
shirt. After discovering his loss Curtis
reported the theft to the Oakland police
and was advised by them to notify the
police of this city. He arrived here last
evening and gave a description of the pin
to Captain Seymour.
Curtis prizes the pin very highly, as It
was presented to him by his mother.

The Clay Clement-L. R. Stockwell en
gagement at the Columbia Theater is
proving an inviting attraction for a large
number of theater-goers who are Inter
ested in the dramatization of the Dickens
works. "A Great Obstacle," In which the
company is appearing, is from the novel
of "No Thoroughfare," and the produc
tion is one of many attractions. The stars
are well cast in the roles of Obenrelzer
and Joey Ladel and the remainder of the
cast is most satisfactory. "A Great Ob
stacle" is to remain the bill up to and
including Sunday night. Beginning next
Monday afternoon the company will ap
pear in a revival of the idyllic comedy
trom the pen of Mr. Clement, "The New
Dominion," in which Clement will appear
in his impersonation of the Baron von

and should bring out some large audi

Harry Samuels Concert.
Sherman & Clay Hall was crowded to
its mmojt capacity last evening by the
friends and admirers of Harry Samuels,
the violinist, and a most enthusiastic re
ception was accorded to the returned
muMeian. Mr. Samuels has gained much
since his last appearance In San Krai;
ci.Â«co. His twhnique Is brilliant, his in
tonation excellently true and his tone,
though larking in force, is smooth and
sweet. His instrument hardly seems to
do Mr. Famuels justice, and the thin, poor
tone that w;is occasionally evident was
possibly due to the inferior violin. Pro
fessor Herrnann Genss ably assisted the
violinist in the Schumann Sona.ta, op. 105,

heavy for the light tone of the violin,
and Mr.=. Strelitz-Davis piayed a pieasa^.:

ARRIVED*.
NEW TORK. Sept. 6.â The hopes aroused by
yesterday's increase in business that a period {
of more active trading in stocks was at hand i
were disappointed to-day. The stock market !
attain became an unimportant affair and offered j
little of Interest as commentary on general con- ;
ditiens or events. London in particular re
newed its attitude of indifference toward
American securities and buying for that ac
count In New York fell to insignificant pro-
I>ertions. This served to discourage the local
trailers, who based some of their buying yes
terday on the hope that the London demand
would take their holdings off their hands. A
hardening- of the di?.'ount rate In London, due j
to the belief that the prevailing ease of money '
will not last long, had something to do with j
thÂ«? setback to the st<">ck market. The rebuff
given by London to the New fork bulls was !
emi-hasized by the weakness of the anthracite ;
coalers, which declined on the ultimatum of- I
fered by the operators to the miners and the ;
fÂ»-ars therei-y caused of a strike. The steel
stocks wÂ«re heavy as a rule. Colorado Fuel I
v.as an exception, on the heavy increase in net
earnings rf ported fur July over these of a !
year ago. The bears were disposed to let Peo- '
rle'f Gas and Brooklyn Transit alone, mindful
Of their recent unpleasant experience with [
Sugar. Where there was any demand developed ;
there was a sipnincint scarcity of stocks of
fering and price? advanced easily. This was
notable in Southern Railway preferred, which
v. a? advanced frc-m L2 T s to 55 on the high price i
ol cotton. Southern Pacific was well absorbed I
on the denial of recf-nt retorts of friction I
iimcr.g inpi.icrs. The list as a whole hung j
btavy and neglected throughout the day.
The t>ond market was dull and irregular. ;
Total sales, par value. 1730.000.

one of the oldest members of the
National Guard, completed the
twenty-fifth year of service as tyler
of Fidelity Lodge of Free and Accepted
Masons. The lodge wishing to show Us
appreciation of faithful, continuous ser
vice covering a period during which the
tyler absented himself from the outor
portal but twice, and that on account of
illness, agreed to give him a surprise In
the shape of a banquet, at which he was
to be presented with a valuable gold
watch. Within a few days before the
time fixed for the surprise the veteran
servitor surprised the lcOge by becoming
suddenly ill and the banquet was called
off for a time. As soon as he recovered
sufficiently to receive a committee from
the lodge one waited on him at his home
and presented him the watch, the Rev.
Dr. Voorsanger representing the senti
ments of the donators in a clever address.
Since that time the tyler. who Is known
by all who are acquainted with him as
"Corporal" Meyer, because of his long
service in the Guard, during which time
he declined to accept any position higher
than that which carries with it two chev
rons, has fully recovered and last night
the lodge made him the guest of honor at
the long-delayed banquet, which waÂ«j
served in a Pine street rotisserie. There
were present about seventy-five members,
including the officers, ivho are: A. T.

a supper, the discussion of which took
two hours, the toastmaster called upon
the Rev. Jacob Voorsanger to say a few
words to the guest. This he did In an
eloquent short address and there was a
brief response by the corporal. Then fol
lowed selections by the lodge quartet and
responses to toasts by the Rev. Jacob

Point Lobos Improvement Club Sug
gests Measures by Which Lo
cality May Be Bsautified.
At the meeting of the Point Lobos Im
provement Club last held the question of
having the district planted with shade
trees was discussed. A majority of the
members favored the plan, while others
who seemingly spoke from experience in
different parts of the city were opposed
on the ground that trees draw dampness
and fog. The question was passed over
for the purpose of obtaining the consen
sus of opinion of the residents and prop
erty owners before final action was taken.
A determined effort will be made to
have more electric lights distributed over
the Richmond district. To succeed In this
a committee consisting- of Dr. L. E. Brim,
H. L. Horn and H. W. Jnundin were ap
pointed to wait on the Board of Public
Works.
Lot owners who are hedging on the eco
nomical side of pxpensp and who decline
to fence in their lots for the purpose of
keeping the gand from drifting over the
streets and sidewalks will be reminded
that there is a law covering their cases.
To provide this reminder, a committee
consisting of John J. Cassidy. W. M. de
Wolf and W. C. Belllngton was appointed.
Red dust being obnoxious to the people
of Richmond, it was determined that a
greater supply of salt water lx> asked for
to sprinkle Point Lobos avenue
The question of lessening the width of
the sidewalks on Clement street from 19
to 15 feet nnd adding the spaco to the
street is row in the hands of the city
surveyor for the purpose of ascertaining
the cost. Six concrete sidewalks for the
territory bounded by First and sixth ave
nues on the east and west and Point Lo
bos avenue on the south and I^ako street
on the north will be advocated by a spe
cial committee before the Board o"f Public
Works at the next meeting of that body.

Mrs. Del Valle Recovers Valuable
Property by Strategy From
Her Dishonest Menial.
Mrs. J. del Valle. residing at 1711 Web

handsvme diamond pin and a watch
valued at $150 by a Japanese female ser
vant, who had been in her employ but
two days. She recovered the property the
same day by strategy and discharged the
girl.
Mrs. del Valle. while visiting the ser
vant's room, observed that her pin was
sticking out of the latter's purse a? it lay
on the bed. She at once accused the girl
of theft and secured her confession of
having taken the pin. It Was then ais
covered that the watch was missing and
the police were called In. Mrs. del Valle
preferred recovering the property to pros
ecuting the servant and made a proposi
tion to allow the Japanese womtm to
search the house alone. After the girl
had gone through one room the watcn
was placed by her on a bed, where the
lady of the house found It.
The servant is Mary Miyamoto, whose
husband keejjs an employment agency.
The help furnished by this agency have

Machine manufacturing has brought
with it fearfui competition among manu
facturers for the s:ile of their product*,
and among workers for employment.
Just now there is a lull In the United
States, but the months are short sin< - o
thousands were idle and knew not where
to earn their bread, or when the pitiless
night of Idleness would end. Of that vast
number who passed through this long
dark period, half starved yet not repeal

side and bravely trying to preserve body
and hope, we shali never know. Th*Â»
machinery for doing almost everything I*
so vast and efficient that as soon a.s ail
its mighty energies are put forth the
world's demands are quickly satisfied.
Already the sign* of overproduction are
appearing and the lines of. â¢ competition
are tightening.
The last phase, and most wondrous of
all. to be noticed Is that with the division
of employments and the dependence of
every one on so many others for the sat
isfying of his wants no one lives in dis
quietude by reason of his dependent con
dition. The millions In the cities retire
at night expecting that the milkman anl
market man and grocer will serve them
In the morning, while they In turn Â¦will in
some way serve him. This dependence*
is so universal that we think nothing
about it. unless a blizzard sweeps over
the country, stopping transportation, and
then the dwellers in the cities awaken to
the unwelcome fact that they are llvtnsr
on the edge of starvation. But the world
has adjusted itself so perfectly to the
new conditions, each doing a single thln<Â»
and exchanging the product of hla to-l
for other things, that he does not thlnJc

Or.e other machine must not be omltte I
in any glimpse at this subject. The mod
ern methods of making cheap steel have
wrought one of the greatest of all trans
formations in manufacture. Through
these the age of iron is passing into the
ago of steel. The most famous of all tb^
steel inventions is that of Sir Edward
Bessemer. Thi.s consists in converting
pig Iron into malleable Iron by driving
i.ir through the molten metal to burn out
the impurities. The effect of the blast
in to burn out the silicon, carbon, sulphur
and phosphorus. But Bessemer slmplv
deoarburized and desiliconlzed melted
cast iron, r.or was that even good iron.
To make steel of this m*>tal it was need
ful to restore the carbon, and this was
done by Mushet. Bessemer discovered
enly a part of the process, which wuuM
have been worthless without Mushet's a.l
ditiun. The tro perfected one of the
greatest processes in the manufacturing
world. How often has an Incomplete or
seemingly fruitier idea been wrought out
and made priceless by another.
To make a tine quality of iron it la nec
essary to "puddle " it. This was an ex
pensive and somewhat slow process. The
puddlers received the highest wages of
any class of ironworkers anil were mas
ters of th* situation. In making steel the
puddler Is no longer required, and he \a
destined at no distant day to be numbered
with the extinct dodos*.
Ark-wright's Invention was given to the
world the same venr as the engine by
Watts. But the way was not clear fir
any of these great inventors. Not lonsr
after Hargreaves began to operate his
spinning Jenny the working people in that
section of the country broke into h:s
house and destroyed the jennies he had
there, "and made the town and neighbor
hood too hot for him." When Lor.l
Hur.dson claimed from Queen Elizabeth
a reward for William Lee, who had in
vented the stocking frame, she replUrt:
"My lord. I have too much love for mv
poor nenple who obtain their bread hv
thp employment of knitting to give my
money to forward an invention that will
tend to their ruin by depriving them of
employment and thua make them beg
gars." and the riot* over the use of thl3
invention in the midland counties of Eng
land were rife for more than two centu
ries. Indeed, whatever may be charger!
up to th*> credit of the great Inventions
of the world, there ?lre many items that
must be entered on the other side. Nnr
err. the toiling millions be greatly blamed
if they still regard the Invention* which

COMPARATIVE STUDIES Of TY.1/O CENTURIES.

(Concluded.)
One of the greatest changes that ever
occurred In English manufacturing was
the transfer of a considerable portion of
the. woolen Industry from Flanders tc
England during the reign of Edward 1 IT.
For many year* the wool was sent from
England to that country and manufac
tured into cloth, and in that form brought
back and sold. Fianders was the greatest
wool manufacturing country of the time.
The Cistercian monks possessed vast
ranges of moorland in Yorkshire and be
came famous as wool growers. Edward I
drew a permanent revenue from this
source by laying a heavy tax on the wcol
exported. Edward III married a Flemish
Princess. PhiHppa of Hainault. nnd dur
ing his reign instead of sending English
wool abroad to be manufactured and re
turned he began to draw Flemish work
men into England to manufacture the
wool there. An old writer. Fuller. In 1HC-5
quaintly said: "The King and state began
now to grow sensible of the great gain
the Netherlands got by our English wool.
In memory wheieof the Duke of Bergundy
not long afterward instituted the order of
the Golden Fleece, where, indeed, the
fleece was ours, the golden theirs, so vast
their emolument by the trade cf clothing.
Our Kir.K therefore resolved if possible
to attract the trade to his own country,
who as yet were ignorant of that art. us
knowing no more what to do with their
wool than the ?h*>ep that wear It, as t:i
any artificial ;>nd curious drapery, ihfir
best clothes then being no better than
friezes such their coarseness for want of
skill in their making." Hut in those days
the people did net go from one country to
another as they pleased, and it was not an
easy thing to draw these Flemish woolen
workers into Ergland. If Edward's Que?n
had not fx-en a Fleming the task would
have been far more difficult. This ren
dered intercourse between the two coun
trlos rasler. Fuller then tells how the
Dutchmen were drawn over. "Unsuspected
emissaries" were employed by Edward to
visit Flanders, who went among the wooi
workers and "bemoaned the slavishncss
of these poor servants, whom their mas
ters used rather like heathens than Chris
tians; Â¦'â¢ea. rather like horses than men."
Vp early and late to bed. working hard,
and with harder fareâ a few herrings and
moldy cheeseâ and all this to enrich their
masters. How happy should they be. so
they were told, if they would but come
over to England and bring their mystery
wlth them. "Here they should feed on fat
beef and mutton, till nothing but their
fullness should stint their stomachs; yea.
they should feed on the labors ot" their
own hands." "Liberty." so Fuller adds,
"is a lesson quickly conned by heart,
and if forgotten is easily quickened into
life and action. The Flemings were per
suaded, left their country and their loom.s
and went to England and laid a secure
foundation for this great Industry in tn<
land of good Queen Phillppa and of their
adoption. â,
Let us go on 400 years. The enterpris
ing people of America are desirous of set
ting up manufactures In their own coun
try- England Is as zealous to krep what
she has as she was crafty in enticing the
Flemings from their old homes. Statutes
with the severest penalties were passed
forbidding the exportation of English ma
chinery to other countries. In 1713 the
transporting of artificers was punished
by fine and imprisonment. Thirty years
after the sale of tools and utensus used
in woolen manufacturing was prohibited,
though not In British colonies. In 1774.
however. Parliament raised a barrier
against the exportation of textile machin
ery to any country. Whoever packed or
put on board any machine, engine or tool
used In the manufacture of woolen, cot
ton, linen or silk "forfeited not only the
thing itself but Â£200 In money, and was
liable to Imprisonment for a year. The
statute was rigidly enforced. In 17S4 a
German was fined Â£M0 for luring opera
tives to Germany, and in 17S6 a set of
complete brass models of Arkwright's
machinery for spinning and carding,
made and packed in England for ship
ment to Philadelphia, was seized. Let us
not. however, be too severe on old Eng
land if she applied heavy fines to others
to prevent them from doing what she did
hersolf. Other nations have been quite
as greedy and shortsighted, and the in
dustrial policy of our country does not
command such universal respect at home
or abroad that we can harshly criticize
the Industrial policy of other nations.
More than one revolution In the indus
trial world has been wrought by machin
ery. Note, for Instance. Arkwright's. In
vention In 176S for spinning. Hargreaves
had made a great improvement in the
same direction not long before, and soon

Last evening the conference voted to
meet next year at Stockton. The following
officers were elected in the preachers' mis
plonary department: President, Bishop
Amett: vice president and secretary. Rev.
P. R. Green: treasurer. Rev. D. R. Jones.
At this evening's session Bishop Arnett
spoke on education among the American
negroes.
"But should it come up at any of our
sessions I am fully prepared to defend my
self, I have a letter from the trustees ot
my church, responsible men who are fa
miliar with all the circumstances which
1 believe would be a complete Justification
of my conduct. There is present at this
conference a member of my congregation.
J. Tubbs. who could testify in my behalf."
"Since the termination of the divorce
proceedings in Sacratrunto." said Mr. An
derson. "Thompson has seen that he made
several grave mistakes at that time. He
no longer believes me guilty of the
charges he then made against me. He
has no desire to bring the matter before
the conference.
The Sacramento pastor says he has no
fear of an inquiiy. but does not think th.it
any charges wiil be preferred against him.
In January of this year W. J. Thomp
son, a member of the Bethel Church,
brought suit In the courts of Sacramento
for a divorce from his wife, Jane Thomp
son. In the complaint Thompson charged
that his pastor, the Rev. W. B. Ander
son, had alienated the affections of his
wife. The divorce was granted, and
Thompson thereupon left his family, who
remained In Ssacramento. Whether the
conference shall take action in the matter
depends upon the position taken by
Thompson, who, it is claimed, is now in
Los Angeles.
"Xo formal charges have ever been
brought again -Â»t the Rev. Mr. Anderson.''
said Rev. J. E. Edwards, secretary of the
conference. "The members know nothing
officially of this divorce matter or their
reverend brothel's connection with It. The
matter will not come before ud unless
Thompson :nakfs properly verified
charges. Should he do so. however, an in
vestigation won'd be in order, and wou'd
no doubt be ordered by the Bishop."
Rev. W.B.Anderson, pastor of the Bethel
African Methodist Episcopal Church In
Sacramento, has come to the African
Methodist Episcopal Conference, now be

himself against any charges that may be
brought against him growing cut of a di*

SPELLBINDERS
CHARM THE
DEMOCRACY
In the Thirtv-first District the contest
ing: delegation was given the cold shoul
der because they belonged to an Inde
pendent club. McNab's friend? on th â¢
I'ommitlpp werfÂ» largely in the majority
end they expressed sympathy for th' 1
turndown. They saM they knew that the
contestants in thÂ»- Thirty-seventh had
tlie majority, but that they made the mis
take of not appealing to ihe County Com
mittee. Wesley Reed and Francis J.
Heney are not in a revolting mood. Each
holds a proxy and Reed intends to ad
dress the entire convention and ask how
to win with a majority.
CAT.L HEADQT'ARTKUS. SAN JOSE, |
Sept. 6.â The committee on credentials. |
Nichols? Bowden chairman, listened to
the contesting del* Rations from the
Thirty-first and Thirty-sf venth Assembly j
districts of San Kranclsco and turned |
down the contestants. It was shown to ;
the complete satisfaction of the commit- I
tee that the contestant? in the Thirty
seventh polled a much larger vote than
that received by the urbanization ticket.
The only consolation that Francis J.
Her.py and J. Wesley Reod received was '
an intimation that they should have done ]
politics with the other club in the district, j
which, by the wc*\ Is not the regular
club.

torney Leach and Attorneys Frtck and
Nusbaumer have submitted to Police
Judge Smith an agreed statement of facts
as the test case for the nickel-ln-the-s!ot
crusade. The case recites that the ma
chine upon which the arrest of B. Berco
vich was made carried a guarantee that
eight cirars would be given for 51. This
was pasted upon the machine. The play
er was sold checks that carried a guar
antee from the proprietor of the machine
for at least eiÂ£ht "bit" cigrars for each
dollar's worth of checks purchased. The
cigar dealers', attorneys claim thia will
overcome the "banking" feature which it
is charged existed in the operation of the
machines when the raids were made.
Judge Smith will hear the .arguments
upon the statement to-morrow.

CORRECT STANDING OF THE CLUBS,
Boston Wins the Game by the Score
Deciding courseâ Rienzi beat Old Glory, 5-1
If, in the big futurity event, the clever
batch of youngsters h.ave to chase such
strong hares as were furnished yesterday
in the Union Park midweek reserve stake
it is certain that fair tests of speed and
endurance will be the outepme. In sev
eral instances the game hounds were run
to a standstill and throughout the courses
were long and grueling.
The sensational feacure of the day wa3
the running of the Pasha Kennels' sap
ling, Roman Athlete. There was no lack
of epeed in his make-up and the way he
took to the game against his more ex
perienced opponents showed his grit. In
the first round he beat Challenger, a 5
to 2 favorite, and In the next go ran rings
around Mlra Monte, scoring 25 points 'o
the lattor's 4. Tv.-o to one was offered
against the winner In this course. For
the second time out Roman Athleta
showed that he is possessed of the qual
ities needed to get to the front as a stake
winner.
Rienzi won the stake, with Old Glory
as runner-up. It was a close affair and
if the hare had not reached the escape
when it did the result might have been
different, as Glory was in when the gamÂ«
was lost. The winner, however, reachea
llnal position on merit and his victories
were clean-cut from the nrst round.
Pasha Kennels' Round About went
through three rounds without a point be
ing scored against her. but in the fourth,
in a course with the runner-up, the hard
work told and she lost the flag.
Courser surprised the knowing ones by
getting to the fourth round. Grueling
courses proved too much for him.
A fair percentage of short ends landed,
most of which were at good prices.

disappeared. Both families were In good
circumstances and on friendly terms, but
no suspicion was entertained that the
two missing people had eloped, as Tomo
zello seemed to live happily with his wife
and 2-year-old child. It was not long
after their disappearance that the truth
dawned upon the deserted wife and hus
band and every effort was made to .trace
the eloping couple, but without success,
till a few days ago, when Stephen Danna,'
Mrs Taranella's uncle, learned that they
were living in this city as husband and
wife.
Danna came on to this city as soon as
possible and soon located the couple. To
mozello had a barber shop on Seventh
street and was considerably surprised
when confronted by the angry uncle of
his paramour. Danna hurried to the City
Hall and secured a warrant for Tomo
zello's arrest and It was at once served
upon him and he waa locked up In the
City Prison. Mrs. Tomozello was noti
fied by wire of her husband's arrest and
sent word that she would at once leave
for this city to assist In prosecuting him.
Taranella will not come here, as he wants
to have nothing further to do with his
wife, but he desires to get possession of
one of their children, whom his wife took
with her when she elcped.

SANDBAGGED AND
ROBBED IH THE
EARLY NIGHT
William J. Donovan Relieved
of Watch and Chain by
Thugs.
Secretary of Pacific Stock Exchange
Confined Several Days to His
Home After Being Assault-.
ed by Thieves,
The blows delivered by the thugs proved
to be of a serious nature. Donovan's face
and head were bruised and swollen, and
It was several days before he could again
assume his duties at the Stock Exchange.
He is a man nearly 50 years of age and
the experience told on his nervous system
Donovan has no clew as to who his as
sailants were. He cannot even furnish a
description of them. He did not pay
any particular .-mention to the men until
they were upnn him and he had been
struck. He is a man highly respected in
business circles and has been in the Stock
Exchange for many years.
Donovan was dazed for several moments
and could make no resistance. He felt the
daring thieves search his pockets and take
h!s watch and chain from his vest. As
quickly as they had come the bold pair
fled toward the commercial district and
were soon lost to sight. The broker re
covered himself after a short while and
made his way into a neighboring saloon
covered with biood. He was given everv
attention and told the details of the rob
bery. Shortly afterward he was taken to
his home.
According to the story told by Mr. Don
ovan shortly after the affair, he was walk-
Ing up Montgomery avenue to his home,
when he was attacked. He had reached a
small alley near Jackson street when two
men suddenly sprang out and one of them
raised a clubllke weapon, Â¦which Donovan
thinks was a sandbag, and struck him
twice. One of the blows severely bruised
his face and the other landed on the back
of his head.
William J. Donovan, secretary of the
Pacific Stock F.xchange and residing at
C20 Greenwich street, was sandbagged and
robbed at the corner of Montgomery ave
nue and Jackson street last Friday evefli
Ing. The injuries the stockbroker re
ceived at the hands of the thugs caused
him to be confined to his home for several
days. Two severe blows were dealt him on
the head, after which his pockets were
rifled and a valuable watch and chain
stolen. The bold act was committed short
ly after 9 o'clock at night, under the full
glare of electric lights and while Kearny
street was thronged with people.

or willingly ignored the financial possi
bilities of their enterprise. The surplus
earnings. will be considerable. Clauses in
the by-laws dispose of these, returning
them to the public under the form of spe
cial premiums to breeders and allowances
to summer racetracks throughout Califor
nia. One principle, that of retaining on
all races abov.Â£ $400 5 per cent of
the moneys going to the first horse and
crediting with the same the breeder of
said horse, is a feature not to be over
looked. It is a life interest in the horse
any man has bred if such a horse is to be
?l an 5' credit to his breederâ that Is, above
the selling platers' class.
Not an Innovation.
All this is not an innovation. It is a
composite of the best rules enforced by
the leading associations of the world,
adapted to the Immediate needs of Cali
fornia.
As to officials we will employ a good
many local men and we would emplov
exclusively local men if it were not es
sential for certain officials, such as a
judge, for instance, to keep in touch with
the racing world the year round, follow
ing closely owners, trainers, jockeys and
more especially horses, throughout their
Eastern campaigns as well as here. This
is the cause of Mr. PettinguTs appoint
ment. He is now in New York for the
Coney Island Jockey Club. The oljlclals
or the new track will be chosen among
men of good standing and entirely for
eign to the past racing difficulties. As
well you may remark the friends I have
induced to second my, efforts as directors
of the Jockey Club are gentlemen who
nave had nothing to do with racing unl'l
this date and who simply share my. views
and ambition to have racing in California
conducted as it is in England, in France,
or on the best of the Eastern tracks.
"Our programme will be out in a few
days, not only containing stakes, but four
races for every day of the coming season,
leaving only two races a day for over
night entries. This will demonstrate to
the Eastern men that if races have ever
been made to suit one man or one horso
this will be an impossibility In the future.
"Our stakes are all added money; every
cent put up or received on entries going
to the winners.
Will Become Classic Events.
The stakes will be the same every year
and will thus become classic events. The
moneys put up will increase with the nor
mal development of racing, but the con
ditions will remain the same, giving to
winter racing in California a reputaton of
steadiness and permanency, which in the
past, has been a subject of yearly contro
versies in the East, often keeping away a
great many hesitants.
"About Oakland? Well, if the Atchison
and the Southern Pacific can make a liv
ing in California I really do not see why
the California Jockey Club and our club
could not do the same. Most of the peo
ple interested in the new club are per
sonal, friends of Mr. Williams and nobody
will deny that he Is a good sportsman
and a keen lover of horses. Lack of har
mony in the past prevented either asso
ciation doing what should have been done
and 1 have no doubt that the California
Jockey Club will do a great many things
to-morrow which they would not have
even considered yesterday. When it will
be established that there is no cause for
conflict I am convinced that matters will
regulate themselves and the best of feei
ing will prevail.
"We do not wish to Impose our tactics
and our views of racing, but the only rea
son for my friends and myselr to give any
attention to racing is cur intense interest
in the breeding of thoroughbreds. This
is no experiment, but a simple, common
sense copy of what has been done in Eng
land ana France for the last fifty years.
Why should we not have interested in
racing in California as good people as in
England, in France and in New York?
In England racing is a national pastime,
and for a hundred years the leaders of
racing have been the leaders of the coun
try. In France the same. And in New
York I see the Coney Island Jockey Club,
with Mr. Vanderbilt as president and
August Belmont, James R. Keene, Wil
liam C. Whitney as directors. This Is
what has allowed me to convince my local
friends that what was good enough for
them should be good enough for any of
us. It is on the strength of such names
that I have obtained the support here of
men who have kept away from the turf
until now.
Racing and Breeding Go Together.
"You cannot separate racing from
breeding, and if racing did not improve in
California breeders of thoroughbreds
would gradually migrate East and in ten
years from now European countries would
not find in this market eight or ten thou
sand horses which they are Just now buy
ing to send to China.
"Size and quality amonpr common horses
are only kept up by the constant infusion
of new strains, and racing alone with its
abnormal profits can induce local breeders
to constantly import stallions and brood
mares at a cost which is every day in
creasing.
"These are our plans. They are not
prompted by any animosity or desire to
benefit ourselves. For this reason we
firmly believe we will meet with the ap
proval and respect of the class of people
whose opinion we value.
"As to the support we want in the East,
I think we already have It. Ther^ are no
shares to be offered or subscribed, as the
new association has all its finances in the
proper shape."
Prince Poniatowski Says New Jockey
Club Aims to Make State a Great

am there I will have an opportunity to
consult with prominent people interested
aa I am in racing, but I don't call racing
a business. It is a most interesting pas
time, to which I regret to say 1 cannot
give all the attention it deserves.
"The San Francisco Jockey Club is
formed under Influences which are bound
to make it both popular and useful. Rac
ing can be made popular to all classes as
it is generally in European countries, and
useful, inasmuch as it is the world over
the backbone of the breeding industry.
"Without insisting further upon the
personalities directly or indirectly respon
sible for this new departure. I will say
that its most Important feature. In my
eyes, is the superseding of the -breeding
contingent to the racing element proper.
A limitation of profit an the shares of
the new Jockey Club (5 per cent on its
issued capital stock) will demonstrate
that its founde^ have either overlooked
Pastime Not Business.
"I am going to New York on business
of an entirely different order, and while I
new racing deal recently con
summated, by which the Tanforan
]l and Ingleside tracks have passed into
new hands, has enabled Prince Andre
Por.latowski to interest a number of
prominent gentlemen In the project to
place California at the fore as a breeding
and racing center. So far have matters
progressed that a move will soon be in
augurated having for its object a revival
of the "sport of kings" in this State on a
plan which has made it a success in Eng
land, France and New York.
Among those whom Prince Poniatowski
has interested are men who have hereto
fore been unknown in racing circles, but
who are willing to affiliate for the one
purpose, to legitimatize for the Interest
of California a clean, healthy and gentle
manly sport.
The absence of the thought of profit is a
strong feature, and the eliminating of
gambling as a business has gained many
adherents to thp gigantic undertaking.
The new Jockey club has elected a board
of directors, with Prince Toniatowski as
president, Charles L. Fair vice president,
D. Lynch Pringle secretary and J. J.
Moore. Frank J. Carolan and Major J. I*
Rathbone directors.
The services of Judge Pettingill, who
presides at the Coney Island Jockey Club
track, have been engaged by the club, ana
for associate judge the organization has
secured Peter J. Shields, at present secre
tary of the State Agricultural Society.
Prince Poniatowski will leave for the
East to-night. In an interview last night
