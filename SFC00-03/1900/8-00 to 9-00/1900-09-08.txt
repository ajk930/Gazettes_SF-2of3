ED ABOVE.
This parlor will parade about 200 strong.
It will have its own band and a striking
float planned by T. J. McGowan. an en
thusiastic member of the committee. The
Lyceum Theater at 310 O'Farrell street
has been secured by this parlor as its
headquarters. It will be elaborately dec
orated, and Groth's band will render
choice music during afternoons and even
ing's.
An Interesting feature of the parade will
be the represntation of an emigrant train
with scouts, packers and pack mules
<rcssirsr tho plains in '43. headed by Cap
tain "Jack" Crawford, the poet Â«cout and
late chief of scouts in tho United States
army.
Chairman Unwell of the invitation com
mittee requests participation in the events
of the celebration by all pioneers who by
reason of not bÂ»-IonKirg to the Pioneer
Society may rot have received special in
vitations. All pioneers will be made wel
come at a reception to be given by the
Native Sons in N. S. G. W. Hall on Tues
day from 1 to 6 p. m. The local soe'ety of
Pioneers with the visiting pioneers will
marcb to the reception hall in a body.
The San Jose parlors will present two
elaborate floats In the parade. One will
be In the form of a pyramid and will be
composed of fruits, wines and olive oil
contributed by merchants, -packers and
t'ne Quito farm. A second float will be in
tho form of a shell with swans, and will
carry twenty Native Daughters of San
Jose Parlor costumed to represent various
mythological characters. It will be drawn
by four black horses.
The grounds at Fort Mason at the foot
of Van Ness avenue, -where the fireworks
will be set off. are ample to accommodate
the Immense concourse of people that will
attend tho display without crowding: and
all may have an unobstructed view. Cars
of the California, Hyde, Union, Fillmore,
Polk and Butter street lines will land* pas
sengers within a reasonable distance of
the grounds.
An erroneous Impression Is abroad In
some quarters that tho fireworks displays
have been obtained from the East. It is
worthy to note, however, that all of tho
llreworks purchased by the various com
mittees for the celebration are California
made and the product of the factory of a
local company. A display will be given
that will favorably compare with the
most elaborate Eastern productions at
much less cost, and all who will atend
will feel more than repaid for their time

r~^\ AN FRANCISCO is prepared to honor the fiftieth anniversary of the statehood of Calif or
\ nia. The city is adorned as it never zvas before in its history. The streets have been con-
V J verted into avenues of gay color and light. Market street is arched with thousands of elec
tric globes, ready to shed their brilliance in the darkness of the night. Miles of green
branches, twisted into ropes of brilliant green, stretch from pole to pole along the main thorough
fare of the cit\.
Standards of flags erected upon poles zcave for miles from the ferry to where Market street
fades into the sloping hills that lead to the Twin Peaks. Business-houses throughout the city are in
gay attire for the splendid carnival. The Stars and Stripes and the Bear Flag have companion
places of honor in the elaborate, beautiful adornment which patriotic citizens have given to the town.
Last night a 'merry throng was on the streets. A great mass of people moved slowly, laugh
ingly, gayly along the thoroughfares. There arc thousands of strangers in the city, draivn from
evety part of the State. They are here to join with San Franciscans in honoring an occasion which
â¢will be without parallel in their history and which it is not likeiy they will see again. They arc
here to share in the multitude of festivities which the Native Sons and scores of other organiza
tions have provided. Last night they received a suggestion of the magnificent decoration which
the city has made. In an instant a brilliant flash of light shot the full length of Market street.
Thousands of electric lights, red, white and blue, blazed upon a dead background of the night. The
scene zcas inspiring in its gorgcousness of color. A roar of admiration greeted it front the thou
sands of citizens and strangers who saw in the test which had been, made' something '-of what the
completion of effects zvill be.
To-day the fete will practically begin. Business men will close . their Â¦ houses, men of all
classes will cease their labors and join in the carnival. San Francisco will give itself up to fes
tivity, and the fiftieth birthday of the State will be celebrated as no event zcas ever celebrated be
fore in the metropolis. Â¦

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAN JOSE, Sept. 7.â The full text
of -the platform adopted to-day by Hie State Democratic Convention,
assembled in this city, is as follows:
WE, the representatives of the Democratic party of the State of California, assembled in State conven
tion, reaffirm our belief in the doctrines of the Democratic party enunciated in the Kansas City
platform, and announce the following declaration of principles:
PLEDGE TO THE STANDARD BEARERS.
WK glory In the. Kp!endtd ability snd unswerving Integrity
of our candidates for President and Vice President,
and W: pledge to William J. Uryan and Adlal E.
Stevenson our hearty; arid unceasing Fupport.
ASIATIC LABOR AND STRIKES ARBITRATION.
WK call attention to the Inconsistency of the Republican
party, which, while Imposing extravagant taxation up
on the maizes of the American people for the benefit
of the favored Interests, under the guise of protecting Ameri
can labor, is at the same time pursuing a policy which. If
successful, must result in bringing the American toller into
direct competition with millions of unasslmilatlve Aslaticn;
and we /avor the re-enactment and improvement of the Chi
nese exclusion act and the adoption of such laws as will ex
clude all Asiatic labor.
We are opposed to government by injunction; we denounce
the blacklist and favor arbitration as a means of settling dis
putes between corporations and their employes.
REDWOODS AND HYDRATJXIC MINING.
THE redwoods peculiar to California are disappearing un
â¢ der the ax of the woodman at a rate which will soon Â¦
leave none of these greatest of trees standing. We favcr
such legislation &Â¦ will preserve within State or national
porks a portion of these forests, and we commend the action
of our Representatives and Senators In Congress In savin*
from destruction the big trees of Calaveras Grove.
The rehabilitation of hydraulic mining In California
wherever the same can be permitted without injury to other
Interests or to the navigation of the waters of the State meets
our approval. We favor a fair and Just administration of
those laws on the subject which were enacted under Demo
cratic auspices and the prompt building of Impounding works
on the Yuba River In accordance with the report of the Cali
fornia Debris Commission known as the project of 1899, and
of similar works on the Hear. American and other streams
upon which mining Is carried on. In addition to existing ap
propriations we favor the appropriation by Congress and by
the Legislature of this State, in equal sums, of the amount
required to construct such Impounding works on the Tuba
River.
We lenounce the Republican party for ita failure to pass
the measure proposed in Congress having for its object ths
segregation of mineral lands contained In the various land
grants made to railroad companies, and pledge our candidates
for Congress to' use their utmost endeavors to procure the"
enactment of laws providing for the segregation of tuch lands.
.We favor suitable Federal appropriations for the Improve
ment of our rivers and Jiarbors.
We urge the Immediate addition of a broad national policy
for the construction of storage reservoirs by the national Gov
ernment to Bave for beneficial use the waters of the arid
regions, the same to be free for the use of the people forever.
STATE UNIVERSITY AND SCHOOLS.
WE fully recognize the importance of the great work '
that our State University Is doing toward lnteilectu.il
and industrial development. We appreciate also that
the demands upon that Institution have so affected Us Income
as to seriously threaten* Its efficiency. We therefore advocate
. a reasonable increase of the university revenues through the
action of our next. Legislature.
We aJso favor all necessary aid, and the required legisla
tion to harmonize our school system so "Â¦ as to meet the wants
of the people in the elementary as well as In the higher de
partments.
PRIMARY ELECTION LAW.
AT the coming election there will be submitted to the voters
of this State' for their approval an amendment to
the constitution authorizing the Legislature *to en.ict laws
relative to primary elections. This proposed amendment pro
vides that testa may be prescribed and authorizes tha Legu-
lature to apply the law to counties or cities, or cities and coun
ties, according !o the population, and to make It optional in
political subdivision? of lerser population. The amendment
Â¦will. If adopted, remove all objections urffed against 'ormer
primary laws and will empower the Legislature to enact a
' statute that will be at onoe constitutional and also adapted
to prevailing conditions. We therefore declare oursjlves In
favor of the adoption of this amendment and urse all Dem
ocratic voters to vote "Yes" upon the same. And we Instruct
, our. legislative nominees, if elected, to urge ana support the
enactment of such primary law.
INTEBESTS OF LABOR.
WE oppose the competition of prison labor with free
labor.' We favor the enactment of legislation pro
viding for an age limitation with reference to the em
ployment of youth and a suitable reduction of the hours of
labor of miners, and we insist upon adequate sanitary accom
modations for those who toil in the workshop. '
We pledge our nominees In every department of the munic
ipal and State government to the use of the Allied Printing
Trades Council label, as registered with the Secretary of State,
on all printing for State, municipal and political use.
We pledge our nominee! for the Legislature to oppose any
and all measures which may restrict or Interfere with tho
Individual rights of the citizen to quit his or her employ
ment at will. v.\. ,
We are opposed to thÂ» levy or collection of road poll
taxes In the State of California.
RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS AND EQUALIZERS.
THE State Board of Railroad Commissioners, as at pres
ent organized, ha* utterly failed to accomplish the pur
pose of its creation. We denounce the action of this
board In falling to keep faith with the people, and also the
failure of the Republican party in two Sessions of the Legis
lature. In wh.ch It had a majority, to make necessary appro
priation for the prosecution of the litigation known as the
â¢â¢grain rate cnaes," and we favor an amendment to the con-
Ftltutlon providing for the election at large of the members
of such board.
We condemn the manifest discrimination practiced by th-*
Republican party in favor of the property of railroad corpora
tions and favor an amendment to the constitution providing
for the election of the members of the State Board of Eauil
izatJon at large.
The growing commerce of our State requires the early com
pletion of the seawall and beltllne railroad on the harbor rront
of San Francisco and the abolition of all State tolls and a
material reduction of all other port charges. Our candidates
for the Legislature are hereby pledged to carry out this ixrtlcy
We denounce the action of the present Republican na
tional administration in refusing a right-of-way to the State
for the construction of the Tloga road through the Yosemite
National Tark.' . -
ROADS AND VOTING MACHINES.
WE favor appropriate legislation for the permanent Im
provement of 'our roads and highways.
We favor reforms in the law relating to the settle
ment of estates of decedents to lessen the expenses of admin
istration thereof.
We recommend the Legislature Â¦ to favorably consider the
introduction of voting machines now in successful operation
In many States.
The fteml-centennlnl of California's admission to the Union
Is a ecnÂ«3n of congratulation and rejoicing among our people

per broke forth in the Demo
cratic convention this morning
Just as ex-Senator White hart
finished reading the platform
and the resolutions, which,
among other things, gave praise to for
mer Congressman de Vrles.
C. L. Russell of Tulare was on his feet
before "White had well finished his read
ing. "I want to know," he said, "If those
resolutions are a part of the platform?"
The chairman explained that they werÂ»
not part of the platform, but they were
part of the report of the resolutions com
mittee, and Senator White's motion, after
reading the report, had been that the re
port be adopted.
"Then I move to strlks out that resolu
tion referring: to Marion de Vrles." said
Russell, and at once there were yells and
shouts and seconds from all parts of the
house. Jesse Bryan was the most promi
nent second heard in the hall and he waÂ«
recognized. He declared that De Vries
had violated his trust as a Democrat in
voting for the Porto Rican tariff Mil, and
that therefore he was unworthy of any in
dorsement by the convention.
Caminetti to the Defense.
At that, amid the yells that followed.
Caminetti strode down the side aisle from
the back of the auditorium where he was
seated, his finger pointed threateningly at
the chairman, and his voice vociferously
demanding the floor. "I move to lay that
motion on the table," he shouted. Thero
were shouts of "No! No!" "Question:*
and cries of derision and encouragement
from all over the house, but CanaJnetti
held his ground and demanded that nut
motion be put.
"He has betrayed his party." Russell
shouted. "He haa sold his vote for a
Job." And then there were more hoot*
and yells. Then Allender of Los An
geles, while the chairman was deliberat
ing Just what effect Camlnetti's motion
would have on the question, moved tho
previous question. It was evidently un
popular, however, for now the fight wa*
on, the delegates seemed determined to
have It out to tho finish.
"Don't urge that motion," said Fitzger
ald from the stage to Allender. who stood
Just below him. "Let them discuss the
mattlr. It will be better." And in all tho
{Â¦houting and talking that was going on
the motion was forgotten, and Camlnettl
was recognized and allowed to speak.
Denies the Accusation.
"I deny that Marion de Vries was ever"
untrue to his party." Caminetti becan.
i "Then why Md he take office under ile-
Kinley?" interrupted some one.
"It Is true he voted for the Porto Rican
tariff bill." continued Caminetti. Ignoring
the Interruption. "It is true he voted
against what some Democrats believe to
be against Democratic principles "
"Yes, and he pot an office for it." shout
ed Bowden, who sat near.
" And aft.->r the Democrats had de
cided that they would oppose the bill."
Caminetti went on, "De Vrles stayed with
his party. I am sure the Democrats in
Congress are not opposed to him. And
then, too, the office was due to a Demo
crat, and De Vrles had the recommenda
tions of James K. Jones, the chairman of
the National Committee, th* leader of the
minority In the House and all the Sen
ators, and so the place was secured un
der the recommendations of leading Dem
ocrats. What they can afford to do the
Democratic State Convention in Califor
nia can afford to do. The position had to
ro to a Democrat. The President did se
lect one. but his appointment was not
confirmed, and De Vries was then recom
mended. Do you say now thev did wrong?
And are you going to throw down the Pa
cific Coast In this matter? Are you Rcing
to denounce them? His own district has
adopted Just such a resolution as this, and
â¢ I believe it Is hut Just and right that the
I convention should adopt this one."
Jones Objects.
Jones of Alameda then got the floor. It
was a question not of the actions of a
Congressman, he said, but of the consist
ency of Democracy. He continued:
Wben E>e Vrtes was called on to Â«pUin he
said he recognized that the Porto Rican affair
was hut a president for what would be done In
the case of the Philippine*. You must not
overlook tMÂ» question of consistency, for if
you do the oppoalt'on will take every conceiv
able advantage of the situation and they will
have us en the hip. '.i- ' -
A half-dozen would-be speakers arose
In anticipation of Jones' closing, and as
he sought his seat they all claimed the
floor. It was given to Frank II. Gould.
He said:
I have known Marlon de Vrlea. I
harp brrn hi* friend nml he hnÂ«

Then Denman tried to smooth matters
by explaining that the resolution -was not
part of the platform anyway, but was a
separate and a friendly resolution, but he Â«
was stopped by the recognition of Al-^
lender. Allender apologized for having
moved the previous question srÂ» early In
the trouble, and then he proceeded to grill

CALL HEADQUARTER^ SAN
JOSE. Sept. :.â The Pomo
rratic State Convention of 1903
has passed Into history. ThÂ«
convention adjourned this
afternoon, and the delegates
h.ister.ed to the outsrilr.g
trains. At on* time to-day
the convention was on ths
vrrpp of an i:p!y fipht. but wise counsels
and a ftror? prase of Justice prevailed
over petty hatreds, hence the harmonies
of the meeting were preserved.
The first sign of the threatened con
flJct Tras observed last nijrht at the ses-
Finn of the platform committee, when
Supervisor Braunhart and Max Popper
ohjPCted to a resolution enmmondins: the
public pervires of Marion do Vrfes. The
point was raised that the convention pro
posed to adopt a platform denouncinfr the
Porto Rioan tariff bill, and that tho reso
lutions soupht to commend the poi'tlcal
course of a man who voted t*i favor of
the bill. Braunhart. who Is neither intel
lectual nor crat^ful. was offensive In his
larjruatr** and Insinuations. It is pre-
Fum^d I5raunhart wanted to do *ome
ihir.p: to commend himself to Hearst and
I > h<'lan when he sought to misrepresent
Be Vries on the Porto Rican bill. No
doubt the purpose in view was accom
plished, and Phelan may extend further
favors to "little Sammie."
It is known to leading Democrats of
<";.::forn!a that Senator Stephen iX.
M'hito on more than one occasion prior
to JÂ«?3 helpf-d Rraunhart politically. At
the last rr-cular session of the Legisla
ture it was supposed that White would
recrive Praunhart's support on a com
mon basU cf political pratitude. but. to
the surprise of everybody. "Shuffling
Sammi."' turned about and cast his vote
for Phelan for T.'nlted States Senator.
Phelan. to express his own appreciation
of Braunharfs Ingratitude to White, ap
pointed th*Â» State Senator to a seat !n the
Board of Supervisors. It is p^ri^rally said
:hat Rraunhart was appointed to "fill" a
vacancy, but this cannot bo correct. A
vacancy mipht bÂ«= "cr*Â»atfÂ»d" by the ap
polntment of a Eraunhart. but It could
rot be thus "filled."
When the De Vrles resolution r.t In
dorsement was presented EÂ»nunhart saw
a chance to serve Hearst and. presum
ably, an opportunity to pratify Pholan.
T!io motives which prompted Iroquois
Popper to po on the warpath apain=t De
Vri. -s are not clearly outlined, as Popper
is not a blind worshiper of Hearst nor a
j*ersistf>nt seeker after Phclan - s favor.
In order to allay personal prejudices and
remove all cause for introducing an He
mont of bitter controversy in the main
convention, the De Vrles resolution of in
unrsemr-nt was modified by the platform
committee and submitted to the conven
tion as a paragraph simply commending
>Mm as a Democrat and congratulating the
country upon his appointment to the Fed
fT.il service
When the report of th<Â» platform com
mittee was submitted this afternoon a
Vigorous tut unmanly effort was put for
ward to reject the committee's report re
lative to De Vrirs. The delegates were in
no tpmprr to listen to the vaporlngs of
the envious, and so cut the debate short
by pustainingr the previous question and
rejecting, by a large majority, the propo
Fition to exclude the words of commenda
tion.
Gavin McNab's mastery of the Demo
cratic organization was clearly demon
strated in all proceedings from start to
linish. In- no sen?e is McXab a brutal
bos?. While he cave free rein to the con
vention's â¢ admiration for ex-Senator
White, he permitted Phelan to speak for
a few minutes on the Â«>ve of adjournment.
His toleration of Braunhart is Inexplic
able, but a political organization, perhaps,
requires in extreme cases the sen-Ices of
the discredited and unworthy.
In point of deportment the convention
which has just finished Its labors' was
above the average Democratic gathering.
It was an exclusive convention in that the
common, ordinary voting Democrats, who
comprise fcur-flfths of the party, were ex
cluded from any voice in the election of
district delegations. ,'-'_
The Fupcriority of the convention in
point of personal appearance elicited the
admiration of Phr-lan. In his brief speech
he Invited hi3 hearers to contrast the
present with prior assemblages of tho
rarty. Working Democrats may not join
Phelan in exalting the kid-glove Democ
racy, but all the voters are not connois
seurs. Many of the delegates of this su
perior convention hold Tit offices and
many others, if not all of the rest, live in
expectation of official emoluments. Hetice
they are arrayed In "purple and fine
linen." Contentment and aspiration are
blended.
An event of the convention season here
was the gallant and successful fight which
Senator R. Porter Ashe. made for the
Congressional nomination in the Fourth
District. Herein Gavin McN'ab displayed
keen political judfjment. While he was
not a supporter of Senator Ashe he had
the capacity to perceive that the bestowal
of the honor on a young and progressive
candidate would not Injure the organiza
tion. He reflected no doubt that the Re
publicans would win and that Senator
Ashe was young enough to outgrow a
political reverse.
Mention in the Democratic , evening
press that Mayor Phelan gave his consent
to several nominations afforded infinite
umusement to the delegates. Few per
sons other than the clerks of the Hotel
Vendome knew that Phelan was In town.
His first and only appearance on the
Ftage of the convention took place en the
rve of adjournment. He came forward
on his own motion to indorse Hesrst's
scheme for organizing clubs, otherwise
he would not have been heard from or
heard of.

tions for electors at large would be
in order. This brought Frank H. Gould
to the stage. He said:
I desire to present the name of the Hon. J.
H. Seawell of Mendoclno. His life in this
State, both personal and political, had been the
speech I would make to-day had that life not
already spoken. He was born in Missouri and
came here when a boy and located In Califor
nia In Xapa County. When he rose to man's
estate he was sent to the Senate of the State
of California, and his record there Is open to
any man who runs and may read. High as the
redwoods of his native State, and as straight
in his character, I take pleasure In sub
mitting his narr.Â» to you.
There was great enthusiasm over
Gould's short speech, and Seawell's name
was received with cheers.
D. M. Delmas then rose, and at once,
the whisper went round that White, had
at last appeared in the field. Delmas
spoke very briefly. He said: : .*.;
I nominate the man whose name has so often
been upon my lips during this conventtcn. I
nominate Stephen II. White. The name is Its
own eulogy. The record of this man la not
only part of the record of the Democratic
party of this State, but is part of the record
of the Democratic party ot this nation. I
cculd pour forth his praises, but the convention
is drawing to a close, so I conclude by a sim
ple reiteration of the name of that favored
son of the Democracy of the Hon.
Stephen M. White.
Cheers greeted the remarks of Mr. Del
mas.
Theodore Fell, District Attorney of
Napa County, took the platform and In a
speech that brought cheers of enthusiasm'
seconded the nomination of Seawell. and
Bowden moved to dose the nominations.
He was interrupted by White, however,
who came forward to decline his nomin
ation and to name in his place WlUard. H.
Stimson of Los AngeleA. White said:
Whatever I have* done has been done for the
benefit of the party. I thank the fcentiemen
who have showered encomiums upon me, but
I can only say I am not worth them. And I
suggest that I be permitted to withdraw from
this contest, and I ansure you that no sug
gestion 1 could make as a candidate will be
omitted when I am not a candidate. I have
made up my mind that If I am worthy of your
eonflJence you will let me substitute Mr. W!l

self. If it be thought that I can be cf any

some Judsment in these matters from experi

that you will allow me to substitute the name
of the man to whom. In my Judgment, your
allegiance should be given.
Earl Rogers of Los Anjceles was quick
to take up the word and he started a
rattling speech for Stimson.
Jacobs moved the nominations be closed
and that the secretary cast the ballot, and
this was done.

convention for the manner in which they
had handled it? business, and Steve Whito
Â«eccnded the resolution and put it and saw
it carried.
That ended the business. A dozen aspir
ing delegates sousrht the honor of maklnsr
the motion to adjourn sine die. One of
them was made happy, and then, as It
was nearly 3 o'clock, the delegB.te3
trooped out of the place, some bent on
dinner, some running for the train to get
home, and all glad it was over and con
pratulatlnsr themselves on the character
of the session.
Â«entat:cr. he win never g-et my vote," was
lt c burden of Allender's words.
Ther. Warren D. English of Alameda
had his say, but he did not help matters.
"De Vries voted under a misapprehen
f! r.." he started to say. but hoots of de
rision drowned his words. "De Vries was
young," he continued, when the delegates
vould let him proceed, "and he may have
XTiade iriist s.ices, as every one else made)
rr.:st.ax*rs. If he has made mistakes, let us
forgive him," pleaded English, but there
were shouts of "No! no!"
TV. R. Jacobs of Stockton then had his
say.
"Are you opposed to De Vries' confirma
tion?" he asked. "Has it been shown
that Marion <ie Vries has sold his honor
ar.d betrayed his party for a paltrj- of
fice? I say, no! He would not sell him
self for ar.y office In this country. Don't
condemn him until you know whether or
not he has voted for that Porto Rican
tariff."
Sacra.rnea.to Scoffs at the South.
Then one of the Sacramento delegates
cj>oke fervently in favor of ;he resolution,
c<r riding the south for being more willing
ar.d abie in the criticism of the northern
Congressmen than they are In electing
Democrats In their own districts. He de-
FCribed the Second District as being a
pure Democratic district *o far as the
Congressman was concerned, even when
rhÂ«; head of the ticket went Republican.
Â£nd he said Marion de Vries was the man
who made that possible. "Every Demo
crat in the district loves him!" the dele
paie shouted, "and every Democrat in the
district knows him. And I warn you It
Is unfair, it it unjust, to treat him as you
are treating him. Don't misuse the men
Â¦who fight your battlec."
Frank Allen of Alameda rose to say
that he could not consistently support any
man ajralr.?t whom such charges had been
nade, when the charges were uncontra
c!c,tr-d and unexplained.
Louis de F. Bart'.ett of San Francisco

tut he failed and Waters got the floor.
He pleaded for peace, ar.d the convention
was wining to cheer for peace, but it was
not willlr.p to have It in all Its blissful
worttj- until the De Vries resolution had

Victory for DÂ» Vries.
A San Joaquin delegate took the floor
lone enough to explain that while Do
Vrlea had voted with the bill in the first
place he had finally voted against it, but
ho could not set any further than that,
for the venerable Jasper McDonald again
!:r'>uf?ht up the previous question, and
this time it was considered and carried.
The motion to strike out the De Vries
resolution was then r>ut. There was a
Â¦wave of ayes and an ocean of noes, and
the chair" decided that the resolution
fhould remain in the report. Then Steve
White's notion to adopt the report of the
cimm ittÂ«-Â« ttm read was r>'it and carried
arÂ«i the Incident was eaded.
It hart t>ern suggested that, in the Inter

WILLIAMS, Sept. 7.â Full details
cf the tragic accident which re
sulted in the death of J. H.
Benham while on a hunting
trip on Eel River early this
'. week emphasize the remarkable fortitude
I displayed by the huntsman. After re had
Â¦ received his death wound Ber.ham rode
i eighteen miles on a mule, over a rough
I mountain trail, and he bore up with such
i rare bravery that his comrades could but
I marvel at Ms pluck.
I On Sunday morr.ing a party of four,
I consisting of Benham. J. E. Rathbun, A.

j The mules were unpacked and a hasty
â¢ lunch prepared, after wnich the hunters
Â¦ set out in quest of game.
Joe Benham crossed over a canyon a
j half mile from camp and had climbed al-
I most to the top on the opposite side, when
! his hounds mn a large buck out of the
brush. He braced himself again;t a small

After Mrs. Clasby's testimony was fin
ished, the court was again thrown open
to the public. The ten-year-old daughter
of the prisoner was sworn and testified
concerning the intimacy of Clasby and
Mrs. Sutton. She said she had been
warned by Clasby that he would t>eat her
to death if she ever revealed what she
knew. This closed the taking of testi
mony.
In an interview to-night Mrs. Sutton,
who is a comely woman of about 25 years,
said:
"I am very sorry on account of my dear
children that this awful, awful thing has
happened. My husband has always been
very jealous of meâ in fact, madly so, but
I think the matter could all have b<-en ar
ranged without trouble, had It not been
for the talk of people on the outside. I
will say. however, that Mr. Clasby was a
good man and has been a gocd. true
friend to me at times when I needed
friendship the most."
. Sutton still refuses to make any state
ment.
COLUSA, Sept. 7.â The preliminary ex
amination of Jesse T. Sutton. charged
with the murder of John Clasby,
which occurred at Arbuekle on Sep
tember 1, took place In Justice Bish
op's court at Arbuekle this afternoon. The
defendant was held without bonds to an
swer before the Superior Court.
The first witness for the prosecution
was ex-Judge WVM. Holloway. Said he:
"I was a witness to the homicide last
Saturday, which caused the death of Con
stable Clasby. I was sitting on my wheel
at the edge of the sidewalk, talking to
Sutton. I saw Clasby come up the street
and go into the postoffiee. and I also no
ticed that Sutton kept his hand jn his
right coat poclcet and seemed nervous and
excited. When Clasby came out of the
office, and just as he was about three feet
past Sutton, the latter stepped toward
him, drew his gun and, with a demand I
could not understand, fired. Clasby turned.
picked up a stool and, taking a few steps
forward, fell into the drug store, where
he expired."
Dr. J. P. Cole, sworn, said he was In his
office in the rear of the drug store when
the shot was fired.
. "I immediately ran to where the man
had fallen and assisted In carrying him
to a rear room. Later I .assisted in the
search of the dead man's clothes and
found no weapon."
Mrs. S. A. Jones testified that she saw-
Mr. Clasby going toward the postoffice
and saw Sutton shoot him. She heard
Sutton sav "You are a dead man" Just as
he fired the shot.
When the prosecution closed, the attor
ney for the defendant called Mrs. Clasby.
widow of the deceased, to the stand, and
on his request the courtroom was cleared.
She told of having accused her husband
of intimacy with Mrs. Sutton. She told
him that if she ever caught him with the
woman she would kill him. She had
watched the Sutton house three nights
with a shotgun, intending to kill him if
she caught him coming out.

HANFORD. Sept. ?.â For upward of two

Vlsalla. Bakersfleld and other towns In
the San Joaquin Valley to supply light
and power. When this system of procur
ing electric force was first Instituted the
project was looked upon more In the light
of an experiment than otherwise, but Its
successful operation at a comparatively
light expense, and the ever Increasing de
mand for the "juice," as the current Is
called, among consumers In this valley
have caused the eyes of capitalists to turn
toward the frowning canyons of the Sier
ras. Within the past few days a com
pany ha3 been formed In this City to un
dertake the supplying cf electricity to San
Francisco and large towns throughout the
State.
The company, which la known as the
Mammoth Electric Company, has filed on
sufficient water rights In the upper
reaches of the San Joaquin River to truar
antee a development of 55.000 horsepower
at the lowest, s-tace of water. A flum*
twelve miles in iensrth will be constructed
to the point whrre the power-house Is to
be erected, and the fall of 2100 feet thus
obtained will insure a constant source of
pow;r not equaled anywhere west of the
Rocky Mountains.
It Is estimated that the cost of Installing
the enormous plant required will amount
to upward of SC.SOO.OOO. and the company
will be capitalized for a larsre sum.

It is expected by members of this con
ference thst this year's session will be
longer than for several previous years,
as measures of grave importance to the
church are to be presented and acted
upon, and it is certain that a larger num
ber will be in attendance for the opening
session than for many years previously.
Elaborate preparations for the housing
of the ministers have been made and
everything will be in readiness for their
arrival on Monday or Tuesday, preceding
the opening day. the 12th. Dr. Thomas
Filben, superintendent of Pacific Grove,
has charge of the entertainment of the
visitors and is doing his utmost to mike
their stay comfortable.
The official programme for the confer
ence has just been announced and will be
as follows, subject, however, to some un
important modifications:
Tuesday, September 11â7:30 j\ m., address on
"The Twentieth Century Movement" by Bishop
Hamilton.
Wednesday. September 12â6 a. m., prayer
meeting; 9 a. m., opening of conference; 2 to
3:30 p. m.. Ladies' Aid Society anniversary;
3:4'. p. m., W. H. M. Society anniversary; 7:30
p. m., Missionary Society anniversary. Dr. W.

II. Smith: 9 a. m., conference session; ! to 3
p. m.. missionary yermon by Rev. R. c. Wenlc;
3:13 p. m.. \V. F. M. Society anniversary; 7:3!)
This point alone is enough to stir the
members of the conference, for the uncer
tainty with which they always go to con
ference is greatly increased by the new
law. Rev. John Stephens of Simpson Me
morial Church and Dr. W. S. L'rmy of the
First Church are the San Francisco pas
tors who are affected by the change, both
being at the end of their fifth year and
likely to return for the sixth if the
Bishop so wills.
This conference will be remarkable in
the annals of Methodism for many rea
sons, but chief among these are two:
First, the presiding ofllcer will be one of
the "two newly elected bishopsâ Dr. John
\V. Hamilton, who is to be resident Bishop
of Californiaâ and this Is the first annual
conference over which he has been called
to preside in the episcopal character. Sec
ond, the removal of the time limit for
pastorates, that heretofore cardinal prin
ciple of Methodism, which was passed at
the recent Genera! Conference in Chi
cago, is to be put into practice for the
nrst time in this State.
PACIFIC GROVE. Sept. 7.â The Califor
nia annual M. K. Conference, which is to

League will disport themselves at
Recreation Park during the next
four days. There will be plenty of
life and excitement for the fans from alt
over the State and rooters from the
league cities will vie with one another
in encouraging their pet aggregations.
By the time the last game is played there
may be a radical change in the standing
of the teams, as two contests have been
scheduled for the afternoons of Sunday,
Monday and Tues-iay.
The sport will commence at 1:30 o'clock.
Each tpam will piay against every other
team. This arrangement brings the Sac
ramentos and Stocktons face to face for
the first time on the local grounds. This
game, which is to be played Tuesday af
ternoon, will 1 no doubt attract a grpat
deal of attention, but no little interest
will be centered In the contest Sunday
afternoon between tlie Friscos and Sac
ramentos, who have just finished a series.
As each of the teams is to play throe
jrames it Is possible for the Friscos to
close In on the champions. The present
standing of the teams is:
The Oakland and Stockton teams are
scheduled for the game this afternoon,
which is to begin at jue regular hour â 3
o'clock. Since the Stocktons last ap
peared hore they ha\*e secured a now
man in the person of Martin McQuaid,
who was a crack fielder In the old dayp
of the Haight-street grounds. He has
been playing fast ball in Eastern minor
leagues. The Oakland's long-awaited
catcher, Pete Lohman, arrived the other
day, but, he will not appear in the games
this week, as he is nursing a broken
fincer.
"Umpire Donahue has been shelved by
acting President Bert for retiring from
the diamond at Stockton last week. Ho
quit the game because the crowd jeered
him. The veteran ball player and um
pire, Hughey Smith, Â»has been engaged to
fill the vacancy.
The line-up for the game to-day Is as
follows: t

TKB*chanÂ»plonship rowing regatta, to take place to-morrow under the Joint
management of the Pacific Association and the semi-centennial celebration
committee of the Native Sons, le being eagerly looked forward to as the
m'et Interesting that has taken place on San Francisco Bay for many years.
The r-ouTfie is from the hay wharf near the South End boathouse, three
quarters of a mile souih to a point near the Arctic. Oil Works and return. The
,<m p c e t fur riartlne the first race is 10 o'clock. The -.i<?o will be high at about
U:tt a- m. o!T Iyng wharf, ?n that the first race or two will be on a flood tide
nrd the i <f=t on slack water or an ohbing tide. Th*>re will be six buoys at the turn.
dÂ»rtgTat'<3 liy numbers, X". 1 b<-ing the inside and No. 6 the outside buoy. Where
ih r r*> ar<> r.<>t a? many contestants as there are buoys the crew or Bculler having
th* outside station may take all the buoys remaining after each contestant has
takon on**.
In ih*Â» senior sh^ll race T. Kornan of the Dolphins has buoy 1, W. MeCausland
of thp Arifl? has 2, Stanley Adderley of the Tritons 3. C. L. Ochs of the Pioneers
4 and A. \Y. PÂ»pa of the Dolphins j and 6. In the junior barge race there are five
rrÂ«>w*. the Dolphins having the inskl" buoy, the Ari^ls 2, the Alamedas the central
buoy, the Pinn'+rs 4 and the South Ends 5. After the junior barge contest the
Naval Battalion cutter crews will race. The junior FkifC race has four entries, E.
J. Lynch of tlie Arl^ls having buoy 1, John Lewis of tho Alamedas 2, E. Kragness
of thV Dolphins 3 and M. Cuhxnan of the South Ends 4, o and 6. In the senior shell
race H. Wilson of tbo Ariel* has the Inside station and George McGrill of the
South Ends may round buoy 2. 3. 4. 5 or 6. In the senior skin* race W. O. Patch of
the Dolphins has the Inside; F. W. Avers of the Alamedas buoy 2, C. G. Ayers of
the fame club buoy 3. S. Adderley of th<Â» Tritons buoy 4, Charles Wilson of the
Ario'.s buoy r. and C. C. Dennis of the South Ends the outside mark. In the lnter
ir.^diate t>arpe race, which is the last event, the Ariels have buoy 1. the Olympics
2, the Alamedas ?,. the Pionef-rs 4 and the South Ends 5 and 6.
The smior bnrge race Is considered the most important event on the pro
gramme, and has \x>en placed first In order to Insure the boats being uninjured.
In the senior f-hell race those old antagonists W. McCautland and A. W. Pape will
meet again, the former being in a craft with which he Is quite familiar, while
Tape has or.ly quite recently taken up shell rowing. The Junior barge race will
furnish a goo3 contest, with the odds in favor of the Alamedas, though the Ariel
juniors are a strong crew. The junior skiff ra<"e will probably go to John LÂ»ewis
of Aiameda. w:th Lynch of the Ariels second. The senior shell race will probably
b*- wrn by Henry Wilson of the Arie'.r. The senior skiff race is regarded as a
dft to F. W. Ayers. whose boat neighs enly thirty-one pounds, or actually less
than some sliells. The real contest wlil be for second place, which should go to
C. C. jyetmls. The Intermediate baree race has five entries, of which the Pioneer
and Ariol orevrs are really Juniors, who have also entered the Junior barge event.
The senior Fkiff event will lack an element of Interest from the absence of
G^orgf 12ak'-r of the Dolphins, who considers it useless to pull against the new
AJameda skiff.
The Ariel r-&rg<Â« was fouled at the Astoria regatta by the Dolphins, who turned
the buoy in the" wrong direction, and was considerably damaged. However, as tho
damage Is above the water line the barge will be used In to-morrow's races, there
having been no opportunity to repair her.

DOUBLE COUNTY FAIR.
The big fair to be held . at Tanf oran
Park, beginning on the 24th lnst., Is at
tracting the attention of all the prominent
business men and manufacturers of the
city. Entries for the exhibits are coming
In very rapidly and the inaugural show is
bound to be a big success. The breeders
of cattle, horses, swine, etc., are contrib
uting, very liberally, making the stock ex
hibit one of the best ever seen in the
State. â¢
All the buildings necessary to house
these animals, besides a pavilion for the
dogs, poultry and hares,. are nearlng com
pletion' and are .very conveniently ar
ranged for the benefit of visitors.
RYAN-MOFFATT FIGHT.
All the local Interest In "pxigdom" In
centered In the fight between Tommy
Ryan and Jack Moffatt. which will be
rounded out at Mechanics' Pavilion next
Wednesday evening. That a crowd will
see these two men work their fistic con
tentions to a finish, a decision or a draw, !a
presaged by the already large advance sala
of tickets. At least that Is what the man
agers of the National Athletic Club say.
Both fighters have been and are earnest
In their training. Moffatt seems to gain
admirers every day, and the betting. juJg
lng from present indications, will show nc
very great discrepancy when the men en
ter the ring. Moffatfa performance
against Xeill obtained for him many sup
porters and most favorably inclined opin
ions.
Moffatt looks big and healthy and his
condition seems to be just at the prooet
niche. In bulk he Is a heavier man than
Ryar* but whether he is stronger or not
In actual ring work is another matter.
Tommy Ryan does not shirk work. Dur
ing the past week he has received man'
visitors at his training quarters at th?
Terminal, where he pounds the bag. Jach
Jeffries and Jim Kennedy. All are sur
prised at the amount of exercise Ryar
takes as his daily portion and Jhe llttl*
effect it has upon him. He. too. la in rood
fettle, ready for anything. Both flghteri
will tauer oft in their work from now on.
ROD AND GUN NOTES.
Sportsmen whose chief delight and
pleasure in life is to bring down a buck or
land the many-pound trout are complain
ing generally that they are now betwixt
and between two seasons. The novelty of
deer shooting has passed away; the
streams, except in a few instances, refuse
to give up their life, and the lawful sea
son for small game has not yet opened
The Eel River seems to be the only
trout stream that is satisfying to the fish
erman, and here will be found the enthu
siastic angler during the next two weeks.
Frank Maskey has returned from his
country place near Fort Tuna and reports
the fishing there very good. During the
early part of the week there was a run
of trout averaging half a pound, and later
on some very big fi3h were caught, many
of them reaching the four-pound mark.
Among them were a few steelheads
Sam Heller will leave on Monday for
Eel River.
Striped bass are giving plenty of sport on
the estuary and in the sloughs. The run
off the Alameda side of the estuary has.
been phenomenal, and crowds of boats are
out day after day, all filled with eager
fishermen. G. W. Emmons landed the big
gest catch of the seasonâ a twenty-four
pounder.

G0MES FOR CRICKETERS.
BOOM FOR GOLFERS
The local golf rlubs are beginning to
wake up from their summer lethargy.
On Labor day the San Francisco Golf
Club held a competition over eighteen
holes, medal play, for the Liverpool silver
medal. This was won by John Lawson
with a score of 46, 4Sâ S4. Charles Page
bring second with 47, 51â08. There were
six other competitors. On Thursday a
ladies' fouraome and putting contest was
given at the Presidio links in honor of
Mrs. M. A. IxtngPtreet of the Lop Angeles
Country Club, Miss Eleanor Morgan and
Mrs. Longstreet defeating Mi?s E. Caro
lan and Miss E. Wood, two up. Mrs.
Longstrpet received the prize, a silver
cup. After luncheon a putting contest
was won by Miss Eleanor Morgan, but
the silver cup whifh constituted the prize
was awarded to Mis.s E. Carolan. the
scores being as follows: Miss Eleanor
Morgan 11, Miss K. Carolan 13, Miss
Thrrese Morgan 13. Miss E. Wood 14, Mrs.
McKittrick 3 4. Mr?. Longrstreet 14 and
Miss C. Smedberg 17.
In the qualifying round for the coun
cil's cup E. J. McCutchen made the best
score <S4), which is also the amateur rec
ord for the links, and won the prize for
best handicap score, R. G. Brown being
second with a groes and. net. score of 10L
The eight who qualifled are drawn as
follows: R. J. Davis va. R. G.. Brown;
E. J. McCutchen vs. Maurice Dore; C, P.
1 .â Â¦.Â¦Â¦|*
Pomeroy vs. E. L. Griffith; and C. P. Eels
vs. A. A. Curtis.. The opening round of
the contest for the cup will be played
this afternoon, the semi-final round on
Monday and the final round on Tuesday.
Unusual interest attaches to the competi
tion from the fact that If E. J. McCut
chen proves the winner the trophy be
comes his property, he having already
won it twice. The winners In the opening
round will probably be R. G. Brown, E.
J. McCutchen. C P. Pomeroy and C. P.
Eel Is. This will bring Brown and Mc-
Cutchen together in the semi-final round
and the winner will have to play either
Eells or Pomeroy.

THE heglra of the tennis players to
Del Monte for the twelfth annual
doubles championship tournament

Three prizes have been offered â one for
the coast championship, first prize to
, winner of the all-comers and a second
prize to the runners-up.
The ladles' single tournament for the
championship of the Alameda Club com
mences to-day with a large entry list.
The winner will receive a silver cup, pre
sented by Henry Gutte..-
Samuel P. Hardy haa this to say about
his Eastern trip:
"The change of water was a great han
dicap to me. At Chicago the day we were
beaten by Collins and Faret the wind was
blowing a terrific hurricane, which both
ered us considerably. In the extreme
East Sumner was a little off his top game
in doubles and did not regain his form
until the Niagara international tourna
ment.- The turf courts compelled us to al
ter all of our strokes, as the ban does
not bounce very high on grass. It was
necessary .also to wear spiked shoes to
which we were not accustomed. The ma
jority of the players East play a safe
game and do not try to kill the ball with
severe strokes."
Great Day for Wheel

Combined Yachting Fleet to Cruise Under Signal
IN order to nfgnify their appreciation of the generous contribution ef the
semi-centennial celebration committee of the Native Sons to the yachting re
gatta on the 11th inst. the Pacific Interclub Yacht Association -..Â»11 hold itj
annual cruise to-morrow. A special call has been issued to the yacht owners
to rendezvous at Sausalito at 10:30 a. m. and report at the San Francisco Tacht
Club house. The commander of the combined fleet of all the clubs will bÂ®
W. N. McCarthy, commodore of the San Francisco Tacht Club.
The fleet will cruise under signal from the flagship from Sausalito to th9
city front and will then sail so as to afford a marine spectacle to the citizens
and visitors gathered on the wharves.
A very large turnout is expected, a? comparatively few of the yacht owners will
take any extended trip covering the three holidays. The California Tacht Clnh
has a cruise to Sulsun Creek on Its programme for to-day and to-morrow and
the Encinal Tacht Ciut> has a cruise to Baden, but both of these fixture* wi'l
probably be dropped. The South Bay yachtsmen will cruise up to this city ami
It la expected that some of their boa's will be seen in the annual regatta on
Tuesday.
The annual regatta of the Pacific Interclub Tacht Association, which will
take place on Tuesday, will be the most notable one of Its kind. Not only ara
the usual pennants and certificates offered to the winning yachts in each c!asÂ»
but also the Macdonough cup, the Law cup and a dozen silver cups donated ov
the semi-centennial celebration committee.
The entries closed last night and are so numerous as to Insure very tnterwt
ing races. The keenest contest is looksd for In the 30-foot class, where the Mac
donough trophy, valued at $250. Is the first prize. The chief competitors art*
Frank Stone's sloop Presto, Carl Westerfeld ant! R. H. Morrow's sloop Aeolu*.
J. 'M. Mattoon's sloop Amigo (which will be sailed by Commodore H. P. Hawks
of the Corinthian Tacht Club) and J. "W. Pew's sloop Truant. Of the above the
sloop Aeolua has already won three out of the four Macdonough cups already
awarded, the Bloop Truant has carried off one, while the Amlgo finished only two
or three minutes behind the Aeolus last year. The Presto actually beat the
Aeolus, but was disqualified for heaving some of her ballast overboard before
she had been remeasured.
The start will be by the firÂ© of a single pun. In order to lessen the danger
of colliding off Meiggs wharf the stakelioat will be put out much farther from
shore than has hitherto been the custom and the starting line will be farther to
the westward. ..
The following entries have been received: la the 70- foot class the schooners
Lurline, Ramona and Chispa: in the 44 foot claaa the yacht3 Clara. Mischief.
Neptune, Speedwell, Rover. Estrella, Muriel and Dawn; in the 26- foot class thÂ»

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1900.
THREE-THOUSAND-DOLLAR STAKE
FOR FLEETFOOTED GREYHOUNDS
?X: : : Â¦ â¢
THE great Futurity stake, the first of Its kind In the history of California coursing, will be run to-day and to
morrow at Union Park, under the auspices of the Interstate Coursfng Club. It is needless to say that the best of
all California puppies will be seen in this event. Both from the magnitude of the prizes and the quality of dogs
entered the Futurity gives promise of taking a first place in American coursing annals.
Not less than $3000 will be distributed among the lucky dogs. The winner's share will be $1140, the runner-up will
g-et $570 and the less fortunate dogs prizes varying according to their staying performances, success in two courses in
suring a prize.
The coursing public as well as the breeders and owners have been looking forward to this signal stake for many
weeks, and. like devotees of the horseracing game, have lost themselves in speculation over its probable winner. A Fu
turity where horses are concerned is a highly conjectural affair. To pick the winner of a Futurity dog event is infinitely
more so. All dogs whelped since January 1, 1890, possess the necessary qualifications for entry. Other things being
equal, those hounds whelped in the early part of the year 1S99, stand the best chance for honors, on account of the en
durance and strength that comes with age.
The bettors have made Curtis & Son's King Cotton, by Hughle out of Rockette, the favorite, but T. J. Cronin's
Vandal. Nethercot Brothers' Floodgate and Freda C, Curtis & Son's Psyche, Russell, Allen & Wilson's Btrayaway and
Castaway. P. M. Clarkson's Golden Garter, P. Jones' Harlean Gladys and Lavina, W. D. Murphy's Crawford Lass, R.
E. de B. Lopez & Bon's Crawford Rex, George Parkinson'B Ben Lomond and a number of other fleet puppies entered are
fancied by some and will stand a fair show for big money. Ninety-six dogs are entered in all, which means two days'
solid racing. Besides the Futurity thero will be a champion ctake of twenty-four dogs. This will be run on Sunday.
The betting in the long-odds book for tho Futurity, begun about two weeks ago, has been continuous ever since.
The greater portion of the money haa been placed on tho doga mentioned aa fancied by the habitual bettors. The "book
ies" will have a busy day of it Sunday, when the largest crowd of the season is expected at Union Park.

Accusations of Neglect of
Duty and Brutality.
Two Deaths at Woodland.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 7.â Former Police
Commissioner Frank Moss, on behalf of
the recently organized Citizens* Protective
League, to-day preferred charges against
Chief of Police Devery, Inspector Thomp
son and Acting Captain Cooney of the
"West Thirty-seventh-street station. He
accuses them of brutality, neglect of duty
and lncompetency In their method in
treating the decent race riots on the West
Side. It is said that the league has evi
dence against the Chief and his subordi
nates that the Police Commissioners can
not Ignore. Frank Moss will act as coun
sel for the league. He has a staff of men
at work on the testimony.
The Investigation of the charge of club
bing and other forms of brutalities made
bv colored people against the police of the
West Thirty-seventh-street station after
the recent race troubles, which the Police
Commissioners were asked by the Mayor
to hold, began to-day in the trial-room at
police headquarters, President York pre-
The'flrst complainant. W. J. E'liott. ap
peared with his counsel, and the Society
for the Prevention of Crime was also rep
resented by counsel. Elliott, who had
been arrested in a pawnshop while pricing
some revolvers, claimed that after being
placed In custody he had been taken to
the police station, where, as he was being
led through the muster-room, he was
beaten almost Into Insensibility by a
crowd of policemen. He was corroborated
by two other colored men.
A number of policemen, being questioned
by President York, denied the attack In
the station. Elliott was represented by
Attorney L.udlow, 'but President York re
fused to let the lawyer examine his client
or cross-examine the policemen. Ludlow
protested in vain, York taking the ground
that as the attorney represented a num
ber of clients who have brought suit
against the- city for injuries received in
the riots he did not purpose to allow the
Investigation to be the means of furnish
ing evidence against the city in these
suits.
To <he charge made by the attorney
that tho investigation was simply a white
wash. President York threatened to have
the lawyer expelled from the room.
Attorney Frank Moss, prominent in the
recent investigation of vice In this city,
also appeared at the police investigation.
He represented the Society for the Pre
vention of Crime.- the City Vigilance
League and the Citizens' Protective
League, the latter being an organization
of colored men formed since the riot. Mr.
Moss, not satisfied with the way the In
vestigation was proceeding, asked If he
would be allowed to examine his witness
and cross-examine the policemen. Presi
dent York declined to give him this privi
lege. Thereupon Mr. Moss entered pro
test and filed with the president the for
mal charges against Chief of Police Dev
ery, Inspector Thompson and Acting Cap
tain Cooney.
Tho investigation will be resumed on
Friday next.

LONDON, Sept. 8.â "We learn," says

RUSSIA'S PROGRAMME
CONCERNS MANCHURIA
The statement was made to-night that
no new note had been sent to the powers
by this Government on the Chinese situ
ation. The United States, animated solely
with the purpose of having an early set
tlement of the Chinese question, prefers
that the armies of the allied powers
should remain in Peking until a settlement
is definitely reached, but it is reiterated
that should any . nation withdraw its
trocps, then our Government will do like
wise.
The situation at Amoy, Chipa, having
apparently cleared up considerably, the
Navy Department to-day instructed Ad
miral liemey to dispose as he deems best
of the gunboat Castlne, which was sent to
that port some days ago when the Japa
nese landed marines. The Castlne >vas
on her way to the Cavlte naval station
when the troubles at Amoy threatened to
become acute and was diverted to the
latter place to look out for American In
terests.
The message commends Colonel Aaron
S. Daggett, Fourteenth United States In
fantry, for hit* gallantry at Yangtsun and
for gallantry and excellent supervision of
the attack on the gates- of the Imperial
city August 15. General ChafCee recom
mends .that he be made a brigadier gen
eral, U. S. A. Colonel Daggett has nine
months to serve before attaining sixty
four years. If promoted brigadier general.
General Chaffee states, Colonel Daggett
will gladly accept retirement immediately.
If this Government is taking any meas
ures urging the return of the imperial
family to Peking the responsible officials
decline to make any statement on the sub
ject Such a step, however, on the part
of the Chinese officials, it Is pointed out,
would be highly desirable and might be
an important factor in facilitating the
progress of negotiations for a peaceful
settlement of the existing troubles. With
the responsible heads of the Chinese em
pire at the capital city in direct communi
cation with the representatives of thÂ©
allltd powers much more satisfactory re
sults could be accomplished than by ne
gotiating with subordinates.
Nothing came to the State Department
to-day from Consul General Goodnow at
Shanghai confirmatory of the press report
that Li Hung Chang has asked for an
American escort to Peking. In the ab
sence of notification of such a request the
officials here prefer not to make any state
ment as to the reception of such a re
quest.
There was a dearth of official informa
tion from China to-day. General ChafCee
got through a dispatch, dated September
1, at Peking, indicating that couriers are
still employed to close the telegraph line
of communication between Tientsin and
Peking. This dispatch made no mention
of the military situation and it was in
ferred that affairs In Peking remain quiet.
There is much speculation here as to the
personnel of the American commission in
case the peace negotiations should be en
trusted to such a body, and the names of
men prominent in international affairs in
recent years all have been convassed. In
cluded in the list is the name of John W.
Foster, but it is regarded as much more
probable that if he appears at all in these
negotiations it will bo in his old place as
a representative of the Chinese Govern
ment. He was associated with Li Hung
Chang during the peace negotiations
which closed the Chlno-Japanese war, and
it is said that Earl Li has a high sense
of appreciation of his work for China
then.
The consultations with Mr. Wu are be
lieved to have been inspired by a desire
to learn something of the personality of
the Chinese notables whose names have
been suggested as nroper to constitute the
Cninese side of any commission which
may be named to arrange a settlement of
the difficulties. Mr. Wu is an ardent ad
herent of Li Hung Chang.
Meanwhile, our Government has pretty
well satisfied Itself as to the attitude to
ward this last proposition of each and all
of the powers interested in the Chinese
problem. It may be that this knowledge
is regarded as sufficient upon which to
base another forward movement and per
haps in this case an independent move
ment by the United States toward the ulti
mate withdrawal of the troops and the
settlement with China, which the Govern
ment has had in mind since the beginning
of the trouble.
The fact is recalled that when the Unit
ed States made its response to the Rus
sian note on August 20, the officials hero
expressed the belief that a week's time
would be required to determine upon the
next step and at the end of that time it
would be delinitely known whether or not
the troops were to be withdrawn from
Peking. That period of time has now
elapsed. The reports from tho European
Chancellories indicate that, officially at
least, this important subject is being
treated with the greatest deliberation and
at least another week and probably even
more time may be consumed In framing
the last of the answers to the Russian
note.
For several hours preceding the Minis
ter's visit Acting Secretary Hill and As
sistant Secretary Adee had been engaged
in a conference, and it was gathered that
the negotiations relative to China were
approaching another phase and that an
other pronouncement of some kind Â¦was in
preparation.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â Minister
Wu arrived in Washington
from May this afternoon
and although it was near the
close of the official day he pro
ceeded directly to the State Department.
It is understood that he had received an
intimation that the department* officials
were desirous of conferring with him,
hence his return to Washington. For
nearly an hour the Minister waa closeted
with Acting Secretary Hill and Assistant
Secretary Adee, the door being locked
meantime and not even the messengers
allowed entrance. None of the parties to
the conference was communicative, but
at its conclusion Dr. Hill repaired to the
White House with a portfolio well filled
with papers.
LONDON, Sept. 8, 4:15 a. m.â The Chi
nese crisis presents no new feature this
morning. Nothing appears to be certain
PARIS, Sept. ".âActive negotiations are
in progress looking to some compromise
arrangement with Russia regarding the
position she has assumed toward Peking.
The communications exchanged between
the powers now have better promise of
success. The compromise suggested, It Is
asserted here, is the withdrawal of the
forces of all the powers from Peking,
leaving an international guard to protect
the legations pending^a peace settlement.
The main body of troops, It is also said,
will retire to the neighborhood of Tien
tsin, leaving sufficient forces along the
road to keep, the route open and protect
the railroad between Peking and Tientsin."
Russia's attitude is interpreted here as
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â Robert E. Speer,
one of the secretaries of the Presbyterian
Board of Foreign Missions, received a let
ter to-day from David J. Hill, assistant
Secretary of State, dated Washington,
September 6. Air. Hill says:
"Your letter of the^th inst. asking in
formation concerning the missionaries at
Paoting-Fu and particularly concerning
Dr. C. V. Hodge and his wife, who aro
thought to be In Peking, has been re
ceived. Tho department has had no defin
ite Information concerning the mission
aries at Paotlng-Fu since the telegram
from Consul General Goodnow at Shang
hai, dated July 27 yast. In that telegram
Mr. Goodnow stated that an official tele
gram received at' Shanghai on the ICth
reported all foreigners and many native
Christians killed at Paotlng-Fu; mission
burned. The Americans named were the
Simcox family, Taylor, Pitkln, Misses
Gould and Morrill. Â¦
"In view of the many urgent inquiries
of the friends of Dr. and Mrs. Hodgeâ not
mentioned In Mr. Goodnow's telegramâ
the department telegraphed on August 22
to Mr. Conger, asking whether they were
in Peking. To this telegram no reply has
been received. On August 28, the reports
received from China from various sources
concerning the Paoting-Fu missionaries
being conflicting, the department again
telegraphed to Minister Conger, directing
him to ascertain their fate if possible and
if any were alive to endeavor to send re
lief. There has not been sufficient time as
yet to have received a reply to this In
quiry." <
COMPROMISE HAS A
â¢ PROMISE OF SUCCESS
BERLIN, Sept. 7.â Evidently the Ger
man Foreign Office reckons with the pos
sibilty that Russia will yield to the argu
ments of the powers and will n^>t with
draw her troops from Peking. Discussing
this question to-day, a high official of the
Foreign Office says:
"Germany does not understand the
Washington dispatches to mean that the
United States intends to withdraw her
troops. As far as Russia is concerned It
must be borne in mind that she does not
put forth her proposition of withdrawal as
a sine qua non, but only tentatively and
for the purpose of discussion."
Emperor William's speech at Stettin to
day Is interpreted here to mean that his
plan of overcoming the present difficulty
in China will be adopted by the powers.
This goes to show â as has been claimed
all along â that Germany Is following tho
personal policy of the Kaiser In the China
matter. A number of leading journals
condemn such a course as in contraven
tion of the constitution of the empire. The
Gegenwart, a high-class periodical, con
cludes an article signed "Apolitikos" as
follows:
"Surely it Is high time to determine the
question whether our political life can still
be justly called constitutional or whether
we are steering toward absolutism."
From the present instructions of the Na
val Department, Germany will make the
strongest naval demonstration ever made
at Shanghai, namely, ten warships with
3200 men and 166 guns. Of these vessels
four will be large cruisers, four others will
bo somewhat smaller and two will be gun
boats.
A special dispatch from Amoy says that
both the Japanese and English marines
were withdrawn to-day and that every
thing there Is quiet.
Special dispatches to the Cologne Ga
zette announce that all classes of the Chi
nese population believe that the Chinese
have been victorious over the allied
troops. Striking Illustrations of this are
given.
FATE OF SOME MISSION
WORKERS_YET IN DOUBT
regarding Russian action. Various state
ments are made in Vienna and Berlin with
an assumed air of authority, but the bal
ance of opinion leans to the belief that
Kussia is still inclined to adhere to her
decision to quit Peking, whatever the
other powers may do.
The studiously moderate tone of Empe
ror William's speech at Stettin is much
remarked. There -as rothlng of the
"mailed fist" or of revenge in his utter
ances.
According to the Standard's Moscow
correspondent, Russia's programme main
ly concerns Manchuria, and she needs
troops from Peking to assist in the seizure
of that province, which is looked upon as
another Egypt. Her withdrawal from
Peking Is considered an attempt to poso
as a sincere adherent of the principles of
The Hague conference.
GERMANY BELIEVES i
RUSSIA WILL YIELD
The Tientsin correspondent of the Stand
ard, wiring August 30, says: "The Ger
mans paired with '.he Americans in the
march through the forbidden city. Tha
British naval brigade and the marines of
the legation guards left Peking to-day."
The Peking correspondent of the Morn
ing Post, in a dispatch dated August 23,
says Mr. Conger has written a letter as
serting that without the aid of the Ameri
can missionaries the defense of the lega
tions would have been impossible.
LONDON, Sept. 8.â It Is asserted at the
Austrian Foreign Office, according to thÂ©
Vienna correspondent of tho Dally Mail,
that Russia has agreed to compromise,
leaving a portion of the troops in Peking
and sending the main body to Tientsin,
which will be the military headquarters.
ARBIVAL OF TRANSPORTS.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.-The War De
partment has been informed that the
transport Warren arrived at Xagasaki
yesterday, and that the transport Aztec
arrived at Kobe, Japan, to-day. The War
ren has aboard 'two battalions of the
Ninth Cavalry and the Aztec the horses
of tho Third Cavalry, in accordance with
the decision of the War Department to
not send any more troops to China both
transports have been ordered to proceed
to Manila. The men of the Third Cavalry
already have preceded their mounts to th*
Philippines.

BREMERHAVEX, : Sept. 7.â Three
transports conveying troops to China
sailed from here this afternoon. The de
parting soldiers received enthusiastic
farewells from the assembled crowds.
HAVE REACHED PEKING.
BERLIN, Sept. 7.â An undated dispatch
from Shanghai announces the arrival
there from Peking of Dr. von Rosthorn,
Austro-Hungarian Charge d'Affalres In
China and Dr. P. M. Knobel, Minister of
The Netherlands.
LONDON, Sept. 7.â A special dispatch
from Shanghai says Li Hung Chang has
made a request for an American escort
to accompany him on his journey to
Peking and that United States Consul
Goodnow is considering his request. Now
that a proposal more in conformity with
the original American recommendation
has apparently met with the approbation
of at least a majority of the powers, the
British Foreign Office has allowed it to
become definitely known that the British
Government is of the opinion that it is
advisable for the allied forces to remain
at Peking until satisfactory arrangements
for peace, etc., are concluded with the
Chinese Government.
RUSSIA SAID TO
AGREE TO COMPROMISE
meaning that she will withdraw her
troops outside of Peking, but not neces
sarily a great distance from that city.
EARL LI DESIRES
AN AMERICAN ESCORT
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU", WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â Administration officials are appar
ently planning to open the way for negotiations with the Chinese Government for a settlement of the
difficulties between it and the powers. Wu Ting Fang, ths Chinese Minister, arrived here this after
noon from Cape May, N. J., and drove at once to the State Department, where he conferred for an hour with
Acting Secretary Hill. Upon his departure Dr. Hill went to the White House, where he consulted with the
President. It is believed that subsequently Dr. Hill had communication with the Japaness Minister. Mean
while the question of commission is being discussed. Some think a con: mission to discuss the claims which
each nation will make is needless. Others hold that an international commission should be named to formu
late demands to be made on China. The President has for a month had the opinion that the only way to solve
the entire Chinese problem is for the powers to send representatives to a conference which shall determine
the penalty to be exacted from China. Should each nation present its claim individually and attempt to en
force it by its own methods, confusion would arise and the danger of the seizure of territory might be very
ssrious. There is much speculation here as to the personnel of the American Commissioners in case peace ne
gotiations should be intrusted to an international body. Among those mentioned as possible representatives
of the United States are former President Harrison and former Secretaries Day and Foster.
For a Month the President Has â¢ Had the Opinion That the Only
Way to Solve the Problem Is for the Powers to Send Repre
sentatives to a Conference Which Shall Determine the Penalty
to Be Exacted.

The conferees were pledged to secrecy and
about all any of them would admit was
that an earnest effort, especially effective,
had been made to secure harmony. Jus

Gubernatorial possibility. Senator Mur

had visited Hugh MoLaughlln to-day, but
declined to say what had been discussed

CROKER TO CONTROL
THE CONVENTION
SARATOGA. Sept. 7.â Every delegate
who has arrived here predicts that Rich
ard Croker has the upper hand in the
contest for control of the Democratic
State Convention. Congressman Sulzer is
predicting to-night that there will be "lit
tle or no friction," and adds: "What fric
tion there is will redound to the good of
the party ai;d will give the people to un
dt-r>iand that the ticket is the outcome of
vigorous rivalry, and not like the Re
publicans, all slated weeks before."
It is said to-night that out of the 430
votes of the convention Mr. Croker will
control 277. This is providing- that Kings
County votes as a unit, which, it Is said,
it will do. There are twenty-four con
tests noted. The faction controlled by Mr.
Hill has to its credit 14& votes. It takes
me to control the convention, and Air.
Croker starts off with a total of Z1S cer
tain. Mr. Hill controls the votes In thir
ty-one counties out of the sixty-one in
the State. Mr. Croker controls the votes
of but fifteen counties outright, while
eleven are about equaJJx^ hared between
the two. Talk of the ticket .seems to fa
vor Stanchlield and Mackey for leaders.

EIGHT SPEECHES
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1900.
PALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Sept. 7. â Presi
dent McKinley's letter of acceptance, which Is to be published Monday
L morning. Is said by members of the administration to be the strongest pre
sentation of the Republican side of the Issues of the present campaign that
has yet appeared. The President has not sought to avoid the issue of impe
rialism. Much of his letter is devoted to the issue raised by his administration
of the islands wrested from Spain hi the late -war. He shows what has been done
in the way of Improving political conditions in these islands. Attention is called
to steps that have been taken toward the establishment of a stable and inde
pendent government in Cuba. The establishment of civil government in Porto
Rico in accordance with the act of Congress and the institution 'of civil govern
ment in the Philippines under the Philippine Commission are referred to. Another
theme to which much attention is given In the letter is the prosperity of the
country under the present tariff and monetary systems. This brings up the finan
cial issue, on which the President is said to take a firm stand in support of th*
maintenance of the gold standard as essential* to the continuance of the present
commercial and industrial prosperity of the country.
BRYAN COMMITS HIMSELP.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â Ever since Mr. Bryan declined to answer questions
put to him by the New York Herald as to what his attitude would be toward the
use of silver if he should be elected President Republican leaders have been
watching his speeches carefully to find some impression committing him on this
subject. They have found what they have been looking for in Mr. Bryan's short
speech at Zanesville, Ohio, September 5, when he said: "The party stands where
it did in 1S96 on the money question,"
This single declaration. Republicans contend, vitalizes every word that Bryan
uttered in 1S06 on the silver issue and commits him unequivocally to the position
which he then occupied. Some of the Republican leaders are planning to ~ have
this sentence placarded all over the country, especially in those localities where
the sound-money sentiment is the strongest.

Feared That the Crews of at Least
Two Vessels Have Been Swept
Overboard.
MIAMI, Fla.. Sept. 7.â The tropical hur
ricane, which has done much damage on
the islands of Jamaica and Cuba, struck
the Florida coast Wednesday, the wind at
one time reaching a velocity of nearly 100
miles an hour. It is feared that the crews
of at least two vessels were swept over
board, about thirty xmiles south of here.
The barkentlne Culboon of St. John, N.
B.; laden with 330,000 feet of lumber, is
ashore five miles south, of Casyfoot light,
about thirty-five Â»nile? south of Miami.
She is waterlogged. The Culboon was
driven by the force of the waves over one
of the reefs forming the inner passage,
and la lying in twelve feet of water. Xoth-
Ing has been heard of her crew. The Cul
boon encountered the hurricane Wednes
day morning. At 10:20, after losing her
rudder and nearly all her canvas, the ves
sel was hurled upon the rocks.
Three miles south of the Culboon is a
deserted lumber-laden bark, which strand
ed during the night of the 5th. The crew,
it is feared, was swept overboard during
the storm. The vessel has a windmill,
and is consequently thought to bo Norwe
gian.
POPE LEO TO REWARD
PROOFS OF DEVOTION
Important Changes Pending in the
Fourteen Catholic Provinces of
This Country.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â There are
some important changes pending among
the fourteen Catholic provinces of this
country, which, It Is learned, will be defi
nitely announced after Archbishop Keano'b
return from Europe. For the first time
since the Vatican council assembled at
Rome in 1869, the influx of American pre
lates has been steady during the present
year, and it Is authoritatively stated that
Pope Leo is deoply impressed with the re
ports which all of them have made con
cerning their Sees. In fact, the Pope has
never met so many members of the hier
archy from this country during a single
year before since his accession to the
Papacy. On this account he has been sen
sibly touched by their proofs of devotion
to him, and it is said he intends to em
phasize his appreciation of their loyalty
by conferring further religious favors
upon the United States.
The creation of Omaha as an archdio
cese will be officially announced soon,
while the indications are that there will
be further foundations of Episcopal sees
in Iowa, California, New York and Penn
sylvania. %''-J
It i:Â« 'understood that Archbishop Rior
dan of? San Francisco is to be given a co
adjutor Bishop at an early date. The
probable appointment is Dr. George Mont
gomery of Los Angeles, who has been
acting head of the St. Louis archdiocese
during the absence of its incumbent. Dr.
Keane. in Europe.
A number of monsignors or domestic
prelates of the Pope likewise will be ap
pointed in various parts of the country
soon.

ADVEETISEMENTS.
Like a flash of lightning, sudden and
startling, disease strikes down many a
man. Yet there have been â¢warnings
upon Â¦warnings, unheeded. Food has
lain like a heavy weight in the stomach
after eating. There have been belch-
ings, bitter risings in the mouth, nerv-
ousness, sleeplessness and growing irri-
tability. Instead of listening to these
warnings, recourse has been had to some
of the nerve numbing palliatives that
cover but, never cure disease. Many
serious diseases begin in a diseased con-
dition of the stomach and organs of
digestion and nutrition. For such dis-
eases there is one medicine which rarely
fails to effect a complete cure. Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discover}' cures
ninety-eight per cent, of all who give it
a fair and faithful trial. It is a temper-
ance medicine and contains no alcohol.
"I â¢was cJHicted with what the doctors called
nervous indigestion," writes Mr. Tbos. G. L<^er.
of Lever. Kichland Co.. S. C. "X took medicine
from my family physician to no avail. In look-
ing over one of l>r. Pierce's Memorandum
Books, I found my case described exactly. I
wrote to you and niade a statement. You sent
me a descriptive list of questions, also some
hygienic rules. I carried those out as best I
could, but thought myself incurable as I suffered
no much with pain under my ribs and an empty
feeling in ny stomach. At ni^ht would have
cold or hot feet and hands, alternately. I was
getting nervous and suffered a great ceal men-
ta!iy. thinking that death would soon claim me.
Always expected something unusual to take
place; was irritable and impatient, and greatly
reduced in flesh. I could scarcely eat any thing
tbil would not produce a bad feeling in my
e^- iach. After some hesitation, owinfr to my
pfrfjudice* against patent medicines, I decided
to trv a fewbotUes of Dr. Pierce's Golden Med-
ical thsccrery and ' Pellets.* After taking sev-
eral bottles of each, found I was Improving. I
continued for sir months or more, off and on
until I was cured."
Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets are a
â¢positive cure for consU^Sion.

Valentine's Notorious Ways.
Vacaville Reporter.
"We should have more respect for the
opinions of J. J. Valentine on political
subjects If he and the Wells-Fargo Ex
press Company were not notorious of
fonoer* against the laws. Mr. Valentine
supports Bryan because the administra
tion is endeavoring to suppress a rebellion
against the authority of the United States
in the Philippine Islands. Mr. Valentine
nnvincr succeeded In defying the authority
of ihe United States expressed by its rev
enue law doubtless enjoys a fellow feeling

thrrgr in a little different way in a differ

The rascHlly robbery in connection with
the building of tha ferry depot at San

gated the transactions of the State Har

The question of opening up Eritlsh
Guiana as a field of emigration for some
of the tribes of India, with a view to get
ting them to settle on the soil and thus
relieve some of the congested districts
of the Indian empire, Is pressing Itself
to the front.
MR. FACING-BOTH-WAYS.
WHEN old Join, dunyan drew the immortal
portrait of Mr. Facing- Both- Ways he pre
sented a prototype which John J. Valentine
appears to have taken as a model for zealous imita
tion, for he is now practicing the double-face act with
a degree of energy that must either interfere with his
business or keep him awake at night.
Here is the situation: Bryan is going up and down
the country denouncing trusts as the sources of all
sorts of abomination. In particular he charges them
with defrauding the Government and robbing the peo
p;e, and he vows that if elected President he will make
it easier for a feather to pass unsinged through
hades than for a trust to make a living in the United
States. On the other hand, the Wells-Fargo Express
Company has formed with other express companies
a trust that constitutes a monopoly with a gaspipe
cinch on both the public and the people. That com
pany is now openly doing the very things which
Bryan denounces; it is shirking the war tax imposed
upon it by Congress, and it is shifting the burden
upon the public. Now John J. Valentine serves
Bryan as a letter writer, and serves Wells-Fargo as
president of the company. To present a smiling front
to both Bryan and the trusts would be difficult to
most men. but John J. Valentine can do it so easily
he does it for pastime.
It is but a short time since he furnished the public
with his first campaign letter declaring for Bryan, and
already he h^as issued another. At the same time he
is in the courts of California fighting for permission to
shirk upon the public the tax that Wells-Fargo ought
to pay. The argument of the corporation attorneys
in favor of the right of Valentine's company to shirk
trxes makes a gay and gaudy contrast to the letter
which Valentine recently addressed to the New York
Post declaring an intention to vote for the self-styled
champion trust buster of the country, but there is
nothing in the gaudiness that displeases Valentine's
taste. He likes it.
Mr. Valentine is for the trusts and for Bryan. He
is opposed to McKinley and opposed to paying
tares. He appears in court claiming the right to
â¢exert the full power of the express monopoly in ex
torting money from the public, and he shows up be
fore the public as a supporter of the demagogue who
denounces all corporations, good, bad or indifferent.
Bryan is welcome to all the aid he can get from such
ar. advocate, but when he takes Wells-Fargo into his
camp he must take the trust with it, for neither Wells-
Fargo nor its president, Mr. Valentine, will ever
r.gree to abandon the privilege of tax-shirking. They
may be facing both ways, but they are not losing sight
for an instant of their own interests.
The transport Lawton is now engaged in a busi
ness that will long be remembered as a most serious
episode in the history of the West. The great vessel
is now a pauper ship commissioned by the Govern
ment to carry back to civilization the stranded miners
of Nome.
The local Police and Fire boards have under con
sideration the abolition of the "tapper" system for th*
benefit of firemen. The substitution of the "knocker"
pystem in both departments has probably obviated the
need of any other.
Reports from London declare that Lord Roberts has
by proclamation annexed the Transvaal. It will re
quire something more, however, than paper and ink
for him to conquer what he has annexed.
Vanderbilt, it is said, has an ambition to own a
railroad to the Pacific Coast. It is sincerely to be
hoped that he will seek to realize his plans by build
ing rather than buying what he wants.
The people of the Mission appear to be wandering '
in a labyrinth of confused ideas. They have asked the
Phelanites in public office to guard public interests
with the same care as they do their own.
Local school teachers may have reason to fear that
the barber secretary of the Board of Education may
allow his instinct free play and exercise it on their
warrants.
Twentyrfive reformers exposed their heads a few |
days ago in Hankow and it is almost needless to say
that twenty-five reformer? are now minus heads.
Bryan may think he is running for the Presidency,
but to the country at large he appears more like an
advance agent of the yellow journals.

THE' Kansas City platform says: "The greedy
commercialism which dictated the Philippine
policy of the Republican administration at
tempts to justify it with a plea that it will pay, but
even this sordid and unworthy plea fails when
brought to the test of fact?."
Mr. Hearst is frantically supporting that platform
J and that plank in his â¢'only three Democratic papers
in the United States." nnd is especially calling on Cali
fornia to give her electoral vote to Br)-?.n, to vote
for alienation of the Philippines and to rebuke "the
greedy commercialism" of President McKinley. No
! natter what high virtues may appear in a reaction
against an experiment in externalism, which some of
the wisest have deplored, it is not for Hearst and
his papers to advise people on that subject. When
j the question was in the yolk, and without form in
public opinion, he was capering and screaming
"Nail the flag to the Philippines!" Before Spain sur
rendered, before Manila fell, before the protocol, he
said in the Examiner (August 6, 1898): "There is
nobody in this part of the world who does not see
that the control of the Philippines would be of im
mense financial value to the United States. In the
islands are over ?eren millions of people, occupying
over one hundred thousand square miles of the rich
est land on earth. We have, under conditions of close
I commercial relations, built up a trade of fifteen or
I twenty millions with the little Hawaiian group, of a
few thousand square miles of territory and only one
I hundred thousand inhabitants. It needs no prophet
[ to foresee the great development of trade with the
Philippines under similar conditions."
Again. August 9 he said in a scornful reply to the
"little Americans" who were making the same argu
ments Bryan makes now and he indorses: "Well, we
I should keep the Philippines â because it would pay;
'because the land is one of immense richness; because
we need markets for our manufactures outside our
own land: because it will give us a favorable posi
| tion to contend for the trade of the Orient; because
i the commerce of the Pacific is ready for the greatest
development in history, and if it is turned this- way
San Frnncisco will become one of the largest cities
in the world."
No greedy commercialism about that! August 11,
; iRofi. he began to prod the President, saying: "The
I situation as regards the Philippines is that we cannot
; give them away without danger to the peace of the
I world. / We cannot return them to Spain without in
| cnrring the same damage. We are aware that the
i President hesitate? to assume the very large respon
l fibilities of annexation, but the force of circumstances
! is working remarkably in that direction."
In regard to consent of the governed and equality
. before the law Mr. Hearst's views ripened early. He
i proposed non-equality for the Filipinos and that they
; should belong to us but be pent up in their own
; islands. August 13. I#q8. in an editorial in the Ex
aminer entitled "No Trouble From the Malays."
answering the question, "Are these millions to be
allowed to come to this country?'' he said: "The
question is a proper one, and there would be grave
grounds for hesitating in the acquisition of these
land; if there were danger that these races would
move toward the United States. There is one
reason for believing that they would not make such
a movement in the fact that they have not done so
to the present time. Except for the Chinese in the
Philippine Islands, none of the residents of the Span
ish territory have been debarred from coming to this
country- if they h=ive nnt been attracted hither in
the past, it may be doubted whether they would be !
drawn here in the future. But supposing that with
their attention attracted to the United States, by
the establishment of American rule and commerce
among them, they should begin to move in our
direction, IT WILL F.F. JUST AS MUCH
WITHIN OUR POWER TO PREVENT THAT
MOVEMENT IF THE ISLANDS BECOME
OURS AS IT WILL RE IF THEY REMAIN
THE PROPERTY OF SPAIN."
No imperialism about that! Mr. Hearst wanted the
islands because they were "treasure islands" and it
would pay. and then he proposed a policy that is de
fined as the essential oil of tyranny and imperialism,
that, belonging to us. the people should.be forbidden I
to migrate and denied the right to come here and i
look at their owners!
Having early settled all these questions, Mr. Hearst
claimed that annexation for commercial reasons and
denial of the right of expatriation to the people were
Democratic dnctrinas, purely JefTcrsonian, and that
Democrats were tired of having to vote the Repub
lican ticket to secure the triumph of Democratic
principles. Hearst on November 12, 189S. after the
sweeping Republican victories of that year, kissed
and made up with Britannia to this effect: "The
powers, even if united, would have their hands full if ;
they tackled this aroused country, and they would
kno-w very well that they had been in a fight before
they were through with their job of coercion.
"BUT WITH ENGLAND OUR FRIEND we
can laugh at the fulminations of all the other powers
and go right ahead settling our little dispute with
Spain in our own sweet way. And that is just what
we propose to do. We have made up our minds
to take the Philippines, and we arc going to take
them, paying a fair price and wronging nobody.
But just let any of those powers trje^o stop us
as we are carrying home the bundle, and we will
show the world just one more example of a
power getting thumped and mauled and thrown
in the gutter. So, go right ahead, President
McKinley. Don't let them scare you a bit. The
elections are over, the country is behind you, and
the people are really spoiling for a little diversion be
fore their blood cools. Tell the powers to mind their
own business or you'l! teach them how to do it."
There is something really delicious in that
metaphor of packing the Philippines home as spoils,
like a bundle we had bought, and knocking every ob
jector into the gutter. Yet. that was Democracy ac
cording to Hearst less than two years ago, and tho
California platform thanks him for his great services
to the party! What answer has the party and the Ex
aminer to make to the Democracy it advocated in
1808?
POLITICAL HYPOCRISY.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 8. 1900.

| /"""* REELMAN'S screeds have long since ceased to
| I make any impression upon the minds of intel
j Vta^ ligent men. The press no longer finds it neces
i sary to^refute his strange tales or to point out the ab
surdities of his statements. Now and then, however
some newspaper takes occasion to review one of his
yarns for the purpose of amusing, its readers by ex
posing the crude way in which the fellow earns his
money. An instance of that kind has just occurred,
and as it relates to certain campaign material Creel
i man is concocting for the Bryanites it is worth re
peating as an illustration of what passes for politics in
the yellow journals.
Creelman went to Toledo to find evidences of dis-
I tress among workingmen. He was in search of
j wage-earners out of a job, or those whose wages have
[been reduced â discontented men who are going to
vote for Bryan and better times. He wrote his storj
for the New York Journal, and the Toledo Blade ha ;
reviewed it. The Blade says: "Toledo people hav<
an jdea that this is rather a busy and prosperous .city
but Creelman says 'it is not so. According to hh
tale of woe thousands of idle men are walking the
streets crying because they have not something bet
ter." It goes on to say Creelman referred to formci
millhands now working on the boulevard as horrible
examples of distressed workingmen, and pretended tc
quote some of them. It then adds:
One of the officials who accompanied Mr. Creelmai
tells what the latter actually found on the boulevard
He only met one man who had worked for the rollinj
millsâ a contented Irishman, with all the wit of a natlv<
son of Erin.
After Creelman had discovered that this victim o:
prosperity had worked in the mills for ?3 per day anc
was now working for $150 he said:
"Then you are just losing $1 50 every day?"
"Hell! Who's losing- money?" profanely replied th<
Irishman.
"You are." said Creelman.
I am not.
"Yes. you are. Didn't you tell me that you worked Ir
the mill for $3, and now, since the mill has closed down
you are only getting $150? Therefore you are losing jusi
$1 50 per day." ,
"The , â I am," said Pat; "didn't I tell ye thot thÂ«
mills always shut down In the summer? Ain't I t
wurkin' here fer a pasthime, an' ain't I glad to be git
tin' a dollar an' a half?" â¢
"Well," said Creelman, "you fellows have got Jusi
what you voted for, and I suppose you oug-ht to be sat
isfied with empty dinner pails."
"Whose dinner pail is impty?"
"Why, you fellows who have been out of work."
"Indade, me dinner pail ain't empty. I kin pit a fui:
dinner out of me pail ony day, and then two lunches."
Creelman drove on and wrote up this man as a dis
contented, disheartened victim of McKinleyism.
That is an illustration of the way in which the whole
calamity story was faked up. After reviewing several
other points of the yarn the Blade says: "It was also
a significant fact that Creelman did not find one man
on the boulevard who expressed discontent or who
would say he intended to vote for Bryan."
Such are the resources of the calamity howlers in
these days. Truly Bryan and Creelman are a pretty
pair, and it is fitting the one should be going about
hunting for "facts" to support the speeches of the
other.
DEMOCRATIC IMBECILITY
"""[""'HE platform committee of the Democratic
I State Convention at San Jose Thursday night
ascended to a height of imbecility seldom
achieved even by politicians when it refused to indorse
the course of ex-Congressman Marion de Vries in
the House of Representatives because he has ac
cepted an appointment as member of the New York
Board of Appraisers from President McKinley. If
the committee had paused at this refusal perhaps the
hue of its asininity might have seemed pale and in
effectual to the undiscerning observer; but it un
covered its whole envious system when it compro
mised with the friends of De Vries by congratulating
him upon his appointment! '
Subjected to analysis, the action of the committee
amounted to this: The Democracy of California
cannot indorse the course of Mr. de Vries in Con
gress for moral reasons: he has accepted an office
from President McKinley and has thus withdrawn
from the Second Congressional District at a critical
moment; shortly before this he voted for the Porto
Rico bill, and the Democracy of California suspects
that this vote obtained for him the appointment. In
short, President McKinley offered De Vries a bribe
for that vote and he gathered it in. Yet the Democ
racy of California heartily congratulates him on hav
ing accepted the bribe!
It was singularly appropriate that in evolving this
logical postulate, "Buggy Robe" Braunhart, one of
Phelan's pin-headed Supervisors, should have been
conspicuous upon the committee. Whenever the
Democracy of California needs a jackass to make it
ridiculous it is fortunate in securing the services of
this ex-Buckley lamb. Whenever it happens that
Braunhart is not available, in consequence of obscur
ity forced upon him by the people, somebody
promptly makes him available. For this occasion
Mayor Phelan made him available. That individual,
himself a political donkey of some pretension, sent
him to San Jose to represent the people of this city!
Braunhart charged De Vries with having accepted
an appointment at the hands of President McKinley
in pursuance of a plan to turn the Second District
over to the Republicans. This is false, and he knew it
when he made the charge. At that time the Second
Congressional delegation had indorsed the course of
De Vries in the Lower House and had congratulated
the State and nation upon the appointment of a first
class man on the New York Board of Appraisers.
This should have been sufficient for the Platform
Committee. If the Democracy of the Second Dis
trict still believes in De Vries, and is willing to indorse
his course in Congress, certainly the Braunharts, the
Poppers, the Hcnleys and the Tolands should not
have complained.
Probably a true explanation of the action of the
committee may be discovered in the spirit of envy
manifested by many of the politicians who comprised
its membership. The office of United States Ap
praiser is one of the most important in the country.
The members of the New York board are appointed
for life and receive $7000 a year each. The law pro
vides that they shall be appointed equally from the
leading political parties, and the vacancy which has
been filled by the appointment of Mr. de Vries called
for a Democrat. President McKinley first offered the
place to ex-Congressman Bynum of Indiana, whose
name, however, was rejected by the Senate. Then he
complimented the Pacific Coast by choosing an able
young Democrat from California, who had twice been
honored by the people of one of its Congressional
districts with their confidence. Moreover," in making
his canvass for the place, De Vries secured the in
dorsement of all the commercial and financial bodies
of California, irrespective of party. Could any ap
pointment have been secured more fairly?
California's interest in having a representative
upon the New York Board of Appraisers is practi
cally illimitable. Time alone will show what Mr. de
Vries can do for us in the position. But office-seeking
Democrats of the pinhead variety never witness the
advancement of a member of their party with patience.
Perhaps, however, we should be charitable. Braun
hart at least has not sufficient sense to help it.
Germany has ordered American' troops to vacate
ground conceded to ~ the Germans in Tientsin, and
the command 'has necessarily been obeyed. A com
mand made under different conditions and in reference
to different ground necessarily would have been dis
obeyed.
No one would be condemned perhaps for express
ing a shrewd guess that the tears which flowed from
the eyes of a Chinese audience the other day at the
story of their Emperor's wrongs were of the croco
dile variety.
If certain corporations which refuse to pay their
licenses to the city were as lax in collecting their bill*,
as they arc in paying-, them the people of San Fran
cisco would be justified in taking a day off for a cele
bration.

Attorney General Tirey L. Ford in the following important letter has explained the law of
the situation to Commissioner oi Public Works Frank T. Eyan, and the latter says that the way ia
now clear to begin big improvements on our navigable streams and tide water lands. The start
will be made on Bear River improvements and will necessitate an expenditure of $25,OOO.
Hon. Frank D. Ryan, Commissioner of
Public Works, Sacramentoâ Dear Sir: In
your communication of August 15, 1900,
you say:
Has the Commissioner of Public Works and
the Auditing Board, under the act of the Legis
lature approved February 9, 1900, providing
for the work to be done by said Commissioner
and board and prior acts, authority to contract
for work to bo done on Bear River, between
Wheatland and the mouth of said river, so as
to assist the flow of the flood waters of said
river and thereby promote proper drainage of
the lands and territory adjacent to said river?
I am also in receipt of a communication
from Hon. Robert T. Devlin in relation
to the same matter, wherein he calls at
tention to the limitations placed upon the
work that might be done by yourself and
the Auditing Board prior to the act of the
Legislature to which you refer, setting
forth at considerable length the reasons
for the passage of the act in question.
It appears that prior to the passage of
this act the Auditing Board -as well an
yourself were limited to the work out
lined in a certain report which had been
referred to and made the basis of the
original act creating the Auditing Board
to the Commissioner of Public Works.
The amendatory act referred to in your
communication pro%-ldes for work other
than and in addition to that outlined and
described in the report above mentioned,
and in that behalf the amendatory act,
at page 21 of the Statutes of 1900, says:
In addition to the work outlined and described
In paid report, the said Commissioner of Public
Works and Board of Auditors are hereby au
thorized and empowered to perform other, fur
ther and additional work upon the Sacramento
River, the San Joaquln, Feather and Tuolumne
rivers, and Petaluma, Alviso and Napa creeks,
and upon all tide waters entering and flowing
into the bays of San I'ablo, Suisun and San
Francisco, and also upon the navigable creeks,
rivers and slouehs of the State of California
of a charwter and nature similar to that out
lined and described in said report, for the pur
pose of promoting drainage, rectifying channels
and Improving navigation.
After quoting the above provision Mr.
Devlin refers to certain matured plans
which have been agreed upon by yourself
and the Auditing Board for the carrying
nut of the purposes of the act of iSOO, and
which plans involve the contemplated
work in and about the old channel of Bear
River. Mr. Devlin further says:
It may be asserted as a question of fact that
no drainage of the Sacramento River can be
complete without the completion of this* worK
upon Bear River, and that the completion or
this work upon Bear River Is an Integral part
of the plan for the Improvement of the Â»acra
mento River.
The question presented in the commu
nications of yourself and Mr. Devlin
would seem to resolve itself into tne
single proposition as to whether or not
work done a distance from the Sacra
mento River could be deemed "work upon
the Sacramento River" within the mean
ing of the act of 1&00. provided such worÂ«c
was necessary for the accomplishmentor
the purposes set forth in said act. The
principle here involved has long since been
determined by the Supreme Court of this
! State as well as by the Supreme Court or
the United States, and I believe by the
Supreme Court of every State and Terrl
tor>' where there has been any consider
able amount of mining litigation.
The Federal statutes In relation to
annual labor upon mining claims provide
that "on each claim located after the
passage of this act and until a patent
shall have been Issued therefor not lesa
than one hundred dollars' worth of labor
shall be performed or Improvements made
during each year." L.abor performed "on
each claim" has been herd to include labor
performed a distance from the claim It
self, as where the labor is performed in
the turning of a stream or the Introduc
tion of water, or where the improvement
consists in the construction of a flume to
carry oft the debris or waste material and
the like.
The principle to be kept in view, the
court ?avs la that the labor must be per
formed "with a view of developing the
claim and extracting the minerals there
from; that if such labor tend to accom
plish this purpose that it i.=, within The
meaning of the law. performed "on the
claim." This principle you will find laid
down in De Noon vs. Morrison, S3 Cnl.
161, St. Louis Smelting Company vs.
Kempt, 104 U. S. 654, and also in 2 I-ind
ley on Mines, sec. 631. page Till, where thÂ»
authorities are collected and cited.
There has never been a dissenting voice.
so far as I have ever heard, in rospect to
I the principle last above set forth. The
same reasoning must apply here, p .)..,
Auditing Board to the CommlsÂ«i : -,'.' '.
Public Works, together with your. .
such Commissioner, shall find aa * ferr
that the doing of the work cont Tnpfar \
upon the Bear River is necessary â¢ ' c ,,_'

vided for in the act of 1D0O and thai tap*
work tends directly to the acct>ri''i u v"
ment of the purposes set forth in the apt
referred to. then I am of tho opinion thai
such work Is within the meaning nf thÂ»am
of 1900 and that thf> Aurlltins: Board

do such work. Any other construction It
seem? to me, would violate the eleartj ex

Commission Has Laid Out Plans to
Clear the Course of Bear
River.
Frank D. Ryan. Comm^sinnpr of Pub
lic Works, was seen by a roprrs<Â»ntat!vÂ»
of The Call and stated that a meeting of
the Board of Public Works will be held n*
Sacramento to-day to consider the advis
ability of startir.g work on the proposed
improvement an Bear River at once. It i*
thought that the work to be performed
will necessitate an expenditure of abmr
$25,000.
It is the intention of the commission 'o
clear the brush in the frc<\ of the rivor
and to confine the stream to a channel
that will carry the water off and give It
clear right of way in Its flow toward thÂ«
Feather River. This plan, while rectify
ing the course of the stream by confining
it, will result in great benefit to farmers
along the river, by preventing possibility
of overflow of their lowlands.

Shrimp-Fishing Camp Near Califor

of Kip Hoi and Wu
Kan.
Special D'.Pi>ateh to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 7.â An up-to-date
elopement on Wednesday night shook the
social fabric of the Chinese shrimp fishing
camp above California City. Kip Hoi, a
boat builder and net repairer, bore off in
triumph the beautiful Wu Kan, who was
supposed to be a slave girl of Sam Kee,
a recent arrival at the camp. Kip Hoi
had worked in the camp for several years.
Wu Kan cooked for Sam Kee, and in
spare moments helped mend the shrimp
nets, as did also Kip when time hung
heavily on his hands.
At midnight on Wednesday, while the
Chinese at the camp were sleeping off, the
effects of an opium debauch, the young
couple made their way to the wharf,
where was moored a small junk with a
light bat-wing sail. Into the boat Kip
placed his sweetheart, and, casting a
handful of joss papers behind him to keep
evil spirits from following, he sprang into
the boat and pushed out into the bay.
The camp had no knowledge of the
elopement until the next morning when
Sam Kee startled the colony with the
story of his loss. He started for San
Francisco yesterday morning to institute
tho search fur the girl, who, he Bays, is
worth $S0O.

NO PRIVATE BOXES IN

Superior Judge Fitzgerald Upholds the
Right of the Police 'Commission to
Close Them,
Special Dispatch to The Call.

SPIRITUALISTS GATHER
IN THE GARDEN CITY
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 7.â Judge Fitzgerald. In the Superior Court late
this afternoon, rendered a decision in which he sustained the Police Com
mission in its efforts to close the private boxes in saloons. The opinion states
that the commission is given the right by law to make such orders as it sees
fit in regulating the saloon question. It is not necessary under the ruling he
makes to notify the saloon men to take out the boxes, or to obey any other
order it makes. The fact that the order is made makes it effective at once
and the paloon men have no alternative but to obey It.
Acting Chief Bradish has issued orders to the night force to enforce the
orders of the Police Commission. The saloon men have made no move as yet;
in fact, the majority of them will at once obey the order made by the commis
sion and effective on September 1. The police and commission arc well sat
isfied with the outcome, but do not intend to put any great hardship upon any
reputable place. Captain Bradish says that the police now have the means at
hand by which they can close the dives and disreputable places heretofore
doing business, but which could not be reached by law.

Census Returns.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 7.â The Census
Bureau up to last night had tabulated the
returns of fifty-four cities. These show a
population of 14,044,711. This Is an aver
age Increase In population per city of 27.90
per cent. The same cities In lS'JO had a
population of 11,150.045, making a total
pain of 3.4S4,tMl The percentage of in
crease in 1800 was calculated on the ag
gregate pain, and not on the average In
crease per city. The result was that the
percentage of gain, according to the Cen
sus Bureau officials, while appearing to t>e
larger, namely, 31.33. was not so in fact,
owing to the different method followed In
making the calculations.
The senior captain of the native guard,

The Bolton spinners use Egyptian cot
ton chiefly, and are therefore little affect
ed. The Barnes Company of Farnsworth,
one of the largest Jirms dependent upon
American cotton, has already placed its
four mills on short time for four days a
week, and it is feared that many mills
will be ob!igcd to close.
LONDON, Sept. S. â The morning papers
comment upon the seriousness of the
crisis which has arisen at Manchester,
where suffering Is likely to be caused by
the idleness of operatives, and especially
if. as is possible, the stoppage continues
Into October.
The prospects of a satisfactory Ameri
can crop are regarded as slender.
MANCHESTER; England, Sept. 7.â At a
meotinif of the cotton spinners here to-day
it was decided, firactioally unanimously,
not to purchase American spoi cotton dur
ing the month of September. Four-fifth*
of the employers in the trade were repre
sented. It is anticipated that the decision
will lead to the closure of scores ot mills
lor several \%i'> ks.
A meeting summoned for September 21
is to consider the situation and "if neces
sary to take more drastic measures."
To-day's meeting was open to all spin
ners, wnether connected with the federa
tion or not. Members of. tne North and
Northeast Lancashire Spinners ana Man
ufacturers' Association >vt.re also present.
They had met earlier in the uay, anil it
was understood that they were willing to
co-operate with the federation. In the
course 01 thf meeting the accusation was
ma'le. although not formally discussed;
mat some ol tne promoters of the meeting
had been fortifying their own position by
lurse purchjises 01 cotton since the con
lerence was summoned. Uisclaimers,
however, have met v>"lth cordial accep
tance.
lit-plying to complaints that the resolu
tion was inadequate to meet the crisis,
the promoters admitted that this hail be
come more acute since the meeting was
calied, but thÂ»-y said It had been deemed
-xpedient to secure united action through
out the whole trade before attempting to
strengthen the terms of the resolution.
Tlie chief interest in yesterday's pro
ceeding's Is as ta whether they will hasten
tho end of the corner which has been es
tablished. Mr. Alawdsley, a leading offi
cial of the operatives' union. Is hopeful.
He says- that a fortnight's loss of work
should" not seriously affect the operatives.
Another Meeting- Is Called for Sep
tember 21, When the Situation
Will Be More Fully
Considered.
Spinners Agree Not to
Purchase the American
Product.

After betting had progressed for some
time on the final two-year-old sprint the
entry of little Jim was protested, it be
ing claimed be was a three-year-old,
which was later pioved. The same colt
won a race at Cofusa. starting as a two
year-old. Ulilouon. from the Boots sta
ble, with Uennessy in the saddle, was
plunged on at short odds, only to be
beaten away from the post and disposed
of easily by St. Kica. The winner is owned
by the Alameda slable, and 4*Â£ to 1 was
obtainable about him. Show honors went
to Game Warden.
A five furlong scramble fo: ponies fol
lowed. Viola, piloted by Ruiz and 2 to 5
in the betting, won hands down from
Fusillade. little interest was, taken in
the race owing to the fact that i>rofes
sior.al riders were up.
Such a cinch was Constellator supposed
to be for the seven furlong event that the
.Brutus colt was held a ?> to 5 chance. Cut
off at the start. Butler, who had the
mount, got through next the rail and in a
tierce drive beat Snips a scant head. With
any sort of racing luck the lMtor mare
would have scored handily. Casdale took
the show.
This was followed by the victory of an
other warm choice, Cromwell, in the mile
and a sixteenth selling affair. Ruiz rode
a clever race on tue Murry entry, over
taking and downing Sunello cleverly, at
the wire. Twenty-five to one was laid
against Mat Storn's three-year-old, which
made a remarkably good showing.
For the Drummers' special race Juan
Chico outclassed his field so noticeably
that the event was deprived of consider
able interest. In the opening heat Fred
Martini behind a burro, was given a three
lurlong handicap, and with tne engineers
01 tlie other starters whistling ''down
brakes" beat his Held to the wire at odds
of L'O to 1. The work was a bit coarse, and
to protect the books the judges placed
the heat winner last. After winning a
heat and then dropping one to Abdine,
.Juan Chico closed the exercises.
The events this aiternoon were all car
ried OH by the favorites without excep

In the forenoon they opened festivities
at the park with a mile race, which fur
nished considerable amusement for the
early comers. After Captain Martin, hold
ing the bale rope reins over Lady Ermen
trude, had taken the first heat by an ear
from Joe Bush and Chraley Ochs, Wilbur

caused a knotty problem that the Judges
were unable to pass upon. Cutting across
lots and aided by thirteen yards of Tien
tsin fireworks, the weary eyed burros shut

a uecision to-night at a banquet.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 7.â It remained
for Drummers' day to attract the banner
crowd of the meeting to Agricultural
Park. Just as they always did, the
knights of the grip maintained their hold
on the. opposite sex, for the grand stand
was completely tilled with ladles. It ap
parently cut no figure that the card was
a trifle on! color. The traveling mon,
wearing purple ribbon badges, thronged
the ring, sepurating themselves from their
coin . as a sailor does after an Arctic
cruise.

Repardinpr Mrs. Craven's condition Dr.
D. D, Lustig s-aid: "In pursuance of your
order asking me to examine Mrs. Nettie
Craven as to her mental condition I re
port ns follows: I made an examination
of Mrs. Craven at 1SKÂ» Sutter street on the.
afternoon of September 1. in the presence
of Drs. Rethors. Clinton and Herrington.
Her attending physician; I^r. Herring-ton,
informed me that he had l>een attending
Mrs. Craven .since August 23, 1W0, and
thiit he had been treating her for insanity
following excessive use of morphine and
b<-!nsr subsequently deprived of it.
"I found hor apparently very irrational
In conversation, tUatind and claiming that
she was- being abused and maltreated:
that people were sticking knive3 and pins
in her. nnd she Insisted upon showing her
limf;^ where the injuries were presumed
to have been inflicted.
"This she rfpeuted over and over
again, with slight variations. She was
nervous, but nut noisy nor violent.
"The pulse, which had been somewhat
rapid at our emrnnce, subsided and prior
to our departure was normal. During our
stay in the room she was up and about
and never once exhibited any sign of phy
sical weakness.
"She was pale and had evidently lost
weight.

physicians have confessed their

of their number plainly asserts that "he

i Drs. I). D. Lustig. Theodore Rothers and
i I^. Bazet filed their formal reports with
Judge Cook yesterday. Their opinions
vary but slightly as to Mrs. Craven's con
dition, all agn-eing that physically at least
she Is on the road to recovery. Drs.
Rethers and Lustig. before expressing a
final opinion as to her ganity, ask that
the patient be placed where she can be
observed at all times and under all con
ditions. As Mrs. Craven Is our" t 6n n^tl
there was some question as to the right
of the court to order her Into confinement
for this purpose. The order' for her to
appear in court next Friday was the re-
SU ln his report, which was the moving pa
per in the case. Dr. Bazet stated that he
callc-d on Mrs. Craven at l^la Sutter street
on August 31. He found her "in a great
etate of excitability, with maniacal ideas
of conspiracy and persecution." Dr. Her
; rington. who treated Mrs. Craven, Dr.
1 Bazet said, attributed her condition to
' abstinence from morphine. In his opinion
Mrs. Craven was in no condition to ap
' rear in court. The facts that Dr. .Bazet
: had embodied in his report to the Chief
i of Police resulted in the appointment of
Â¦ Drs. I-ustig and Rethers to further exam
f ine Mrs. Craven.
Erratic and Rational by Turn.
Dr. Rethers in his report says;
'â¢I found Mrs. Craven in a highly excited
condition: she complained of persecutions
on the part of the, Masons, said that
they had broken into her rooms, had at
tacked hef with pointed instruments and
that fhe had been abused by them in a
fhameful manner. She continued to talk
incessantly during our presence in her
room, wandering In her talk Irom one
subject to another.
"Otherwise she answered most questions
lr. a. rational manner and gave a fairly
lucid account of her doings previous to
her entrance into the panitarlum. Her
physical condition pceemed poor, her tem
perature apparently normal, her pulse at
llrst weak, irregular, intermittent and
changeable, but before we loft, within a
half hour's tlmo, it had become regular,
more full and stronger. The pupils of her
eves were normal, reacted upon llpht. and
of equal size: her tongue was moist, with
a slipht coatinp at the base; her heart
phowed no organic lesion, and there, were
no symptoms of any organic lesions either
of the central or perlphercal nervous sys
"Drs Clinton and Herrlngton were also
present at our examination. On Septem
ber'5. In company with D. D. LustiR. M.D-.
I atrain visited Mrs. Craven at the sani
tarium, where we also met Dr. Ilernng
ton. who has been attending her.
"The Information gained from the at
tendantfl in the sanitarium concerning her
conduct in the interim was meager and
not verv satisfactory, they having stated
that Mrs. Craven had been restless, noisy
and irrational.
"To me she appeared more quiet and
brighter than en the previous examina
tion, more definite and more connected,
and It was only upon inquiry that she re
ferred to the Masons and their supposed
ptrFecutions of herself.
"Her pulse was stronger, at times per
haps somewhat weak and slightly irregu
lar: otherwise she showed no abnormal
eymptoms.
"As far as her physical condition at the
time of my first examination was con
cerned. I did not think that she would
T>e able to leave her room for some time,
hut upon my last visit she ha.d greatly im
proved in that respect, and I judge that If
nothing unforeseen should intervene her
physical condition would be such that she
will be able to appear in court within a
very short apace of time.
Things to Be Considered. â¢ %i
"Regardin>Â»-fier mental condition, I wish
to be conservative in expressing an opin
ion. In our UK-jal examination of the
insane our Judgment is formed by con
sidering the statements of irvar friends
and relatives concerning the conduct and
mental condition of an alleged insane per
son, both previous to the beginniifs? of the
mental aberration and subsequently up to
the time of the examination for commit
ment.
"Secondly, we take the testimony of the
attendants at the Receiving Hospital
where the alleged Ir.Fa.ne person is de
tainedâthat isÂ«, statements from entirely
disinterested persons â city officials.
"Thirdly, our own observations of the
patient, extending over the period of time
during which the patient has been de
tained at the Receiving Hospital.
"In other words, we adopt, when pos
sible, those courses in our mode of of ex
amination. Now, in repard to Mrs. Cra
ven's cape, I consider that the informa
tion which I have been able to Rather in
order to fulfill the requirements of course
No. 1 entirely inadequate and Insufficient.
"As far as course Xo. 2 In concerned,
that Mrs. Craven be detained !n a public
or se.mi-public institution, where there is
at least a resident physician, who Is ready
at any -and uJl times to observe 'the pa

mast. They are the American steel ships
Dirigo, Erskine M. Phelps, Edward Sew
all and the wooden ship Roanoke. Arthur
Sewall, the builder and managing owner
of these vessels, died last Wednesday and
his funeral takes place this morning.
The Dirigo was the iirst steel sailing
ship built in America. The plates were
brought from England. Then the Erskine
M. Phelps was placed on the stocks, and
all her plates came from American fac
tories. In consequence the Phelps is
American from k*>el to truck. She was
named after a lifelong friend of Arthur
Sewall and Is one of the prettiest ships
atloat.
In regard to the story telegraphed about
the illness of Mr. Phelps the facts of the
matter have been exasperated. Captain
Graham of the Erskine M. Phelps received
a personal tel/gram yesterday which
states. "Am painfully but not dangerous
ly ill."
The Kdward Sewall Is the last of the
Ftecl fleet to come to San Francisco, while
the Roanoke vu the lust and largest
wooden ship rver launched from the
Bewails' shipyards. It is a matter of com
ment amonp ship men that the first steel
ship ever launched In America and the
finest and largest wooden ship ever built
at Hath. Mo., should bo in port at the
panic time as the death and burial of their
owner and builder.

A Troublesome Consignment.
The steamer Doric, which arrived in
port last Monday from Hongkong, had
among her cargo one stork, some birds
and two Japanese pug clogs, rom-'lKned to
C. D. Hunker & Co. It will be necessary
to procure a permit from the. Department
of Agriculture at Washington to land the
stork, while the pugs must go to quaran
tine at Angel Island for two weeks. An
additional certificate will have to be pro
cured from Alexander McCJraw of the
Horticultural Board or Ij. M. Loomls of
the Academy of Sciences to prove that
they are free from disease.

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
The case against Benjamin C. Bergen
looked very strong after United States
District Judgf de Haven had charged the
jury yesterday afternoon, but the jurors
had he-cn in consultation not more than
fifteen minutes when a verdict of not
guilty tvas returned. It was greeted with
handclapplng â an unusual occurrence In a
Federal court. The demonstration was
rromptly suppressed.
Berjrrn was a weigher In the assay de
partment of the Unked States branch
mint, on Fifth street. On April 10 of this
year he was followed from the mint to
Zlr.kar.d's restaurant by Detectives O'Dea
&nd Ryan and arrested. In a vest pocket
was $10 worth of gold in small chips done
up in a piece of paper. Inside his vest
was a pair of shears belonging to the GoW
< -rnrnent and used in the mint to clip gold
:mo Email b'.ts.
Bergen was indicted for the embezzle
ment of J10 worth of gold from the Gov
ernment. In addition to the testimony ot
the detectives several pawnbrokers testi
fied that Bergen had on several occasions
Â«old them gold of similar quality ana
?hape. The defendant was not rut on the
stand. His counsel. Judge Denson and
Bert Schles-trjrcr. argued to the jury that
t!-.e t-ovcmir.f-nt had not proved that the
p>'ri found in Bergcn's vest pocket had
been tsiKen by him from the mint, and that
In the absr-nVe of such proof a case had
r.ot been rr.nde rut.

would be an impossibility, that I would
rather do without my breakfast and have
my cup of coffee.
"About six months ajro I tried Pos-

lighted with it that I immediately dis-
continued cofTee and besran usine Pos-

to again. All symptoms of indigestion
have disappeared entirely and my

will say:
Trade develorments for the week have been
mainly favorable and the improvement In gen
eral distributive business in the latter part of
Aupust has gathered force in the first week
of September. *~XÂ«eading features have been the
widening full trade reported at nearly all points
West. South and on the Pacific Coast; some im
provement in the Jobbing demand at the East,
with Southern buying a marked feature, rather
better rerprts from the two great staple crops
of the West and South, wheat and cotton,
improved export demand for American products'
notably wheat. Iron and steel and cotton and
unvarying good returns by the transj-ortatlon
Interests of the country. The corner appears
to have turned in bank clearings, because the
aggregate for the first week of September, though
broken by holidays, is larger than the total for
the preceding week. The Industrial outlook
has been Improved by settlement of the tin
plate scale, the general resumption of operations
in the class Industry, the predicted settlement
satisfactorily of the remaining iron and steel
wa?e tcales and the possibility that recent
large sales of print-cloths will avert a resott to
wage reductions in the Xew England cotton
industry. The anthracite coaJ trade outlook
however, Is clouded by the prediction that 140 -
OOfi men will strike this week.
The iron and Rteel trade continues positively
cheerful In tone and a large business has been
and is now being booked. Xo Important gains
in prices are reported. .On the contrary bes
semer pig is lower on the week and little u

CHICAGO, Sept. 7.â Dullness was probably
the most notable feature of the wheat trade.
Trade was small in volume and local in char
acter. October opened H#Vic higher at 73V4Â®
"JHc, because Argentine shipments last week
were only 1G0.C00 bushels and because Liverpool
was higher in face of a decline here yesterday.
The crowd was rather bearish and as a result
of a slight desire on the part of outsiders to
take any more wheat the market sold off. to
73Vic. At the decline reports of an export de
mand frightened shorts and under their cover
ing October rallied to 73*Â«c and shortly after
ward closed firm HSUc over yesterday at 73Vs@
72HC.
Corn was dull and Innocent of attractiveness.
October closed M,@VÂ«e higher.
Oats were dull and firm. October closed %9
Uc higher at 21Â»iÂ®21',4c.
Provisions opened higher on a stronger mar
ket at the yards, declined moderately on local
selling of pork, but rallied later and closed
firm on an excellent cash demand. October
pork closed 12'.Â£c higher, lard 5@7Â»4c higher
and ribs 7*4c Improved.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NEW TORK, Sept. 7.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
Irregularity has prevailed in the movement
of prices for securities this week. The tone of
the market, however, has been firm,, although
the absence of public participation reduced the
volume of trading to a minimum. Politics are
still uppermost In the minds of the financial
community and although the results of the
State elections In Vermont were considered
favorable, there was a continuance of the in
disposition to enter upon any speculative ven
tures. Investment stocks are in demand at all
concessions and holders of securities still dis
play a marked disposition to sell them, money
being easy, the prospects for a continuance of
comparatively low rates of Interest being con
sidered excellent. The decline in foreign ex
change is a matter of Interest to the street,
the large foreign purchases of cotton and the
pressure of bills against such exports tending
to reduce the level of exchange still further.
It Is noted that the Bank of England Is manip
ulating the London money market and it la
also thought that considerable foreign loans
are likely to be made in New York during the
autumn, some authorities going so far as to
predict that another Issue of British consols
may be brought out In the United States after
the Presidential election Is river. The money
and the stock markets here, however, have
reconciled themselves to the idea that the
United States will have to supply foreign re
quirements for specie and no particular appre
hension is felt on this score. London has on
the whole been a purchaser of securities In
this market, although its transactions were on
a limited scale, and speculative interests on the
other side are Inclined to wait and the market
there Is dull. Railroad earnings are still good
end some surprise was occasioned by the large
increase of J1S0.O0O In the St. Paul's gross earn
ings for the last week of August. This led to
some speculative buying of the granger stocks,
that portion of the share list developing a very
strong tone. The real activity of the week,
however, centered in a few specialties, the
movement of American Sugar being the most
notable. That stock advanced to 122V4 in ad
vance of the Increase of the quarterly dividend
rate on last Tuesday from \% to 1% per cent.
The directors met early In the day and ad
journed until the afternoon, but in the mean
time information as to what was intended
reems to have leaked out and a vigorous buy-
Ing movement set In. the Incident being char
acterized as a new Inhibition of manipulation
on the part of the management. There was
pressure in People's Gas, due to the unfavor
able competition at Chicago. Among the few
notable movements In the railroad list was a
rise In Southern Railway preferred, whith sold
up to C5Vi on reports that an increase in thÂ»
dividend rate was not Improbable, notwith
standing the intimation given in the annual
report that the rate would be kept at 14 per
cent.

77te Cotton CMathet.
NEW YORK. Sept. 7.â To-day marked the
turning point In the great bull movement In
cotton on the New Orleans. New York and Liv
erpool Cotton Exchanges. With a crash, amid
tremendous excitement, prices fell 23 to 32
points on the opening, while the close was
weak at a net less of 19@25 points. Between
the opening and the final phases the market
scored some violent fluctuations, at one time
advancing within a point or so of yesterday's
closlnr. The loss of the first call wiped out
fully one-third of the rise accumulated during
the. fore part of the week and resulted from a
bull panic at Liverpool. The public was not a
loser on the collapse of the English and Amer
ican markets, having sold out pretty thorough
ly during the great rise of yesterday. Man
cheater solnners voted at a meeting to-day to
closo down their mills, being unable to manu
facture cotton goods at the present abnormal
prices demanded for American cotton. More
over, there was not sufficient staDle in Eng
land to keep them going for ten consecutive
days. Some traders are talking 10 cents for
January delivery, but conservative parties be
lieve the turning point has been reached. To
day's business on the local Cotton Exchange
was estimated at 1.000.000 bales.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â COTTONâ Futures
opened weak and Irregular, with prices down
2Gg~32 points, under one of the heaviest selling
movements which has ever been witnessed in
the cotton pit. Orders to unload came from
Europe, the South, the West, Wall street and
the speculative public in general, and it was
not until prices were down 14 points that buy
ers could be Induced to take hold. Trading was
very active, except for a brief period around
midday. The market once more shifted in the
last few minutes and broke under heavy gen
eral selling. The ciose was weak, with prices
net K"g26 points lower.

NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â R. G. Dun & Oo.'s
Weekly Review of Trade this week will say:
The volume of business does not materially
enlarge at the East and there is only moderate
improvement at the West and South, but if
expectations of greater activity when politics
ceaje to disturb are realized current operations
will be found to have laid a substantial foun
dation. The most important event of the week
In the industrial -world was the agreement on
the tinplate.wajje scale with the Amalgamated
Association, grunting about S per cent advance
to 35,000 hands, long idle. Other metal work
ers' dispute* are nearlng settlement, while the
Borden purchase of 500.000 pieces of print cloths
at 2 7 4c clears up the Fall River market and is
believed to preclude serious wage differences
there. The final decision of the dissatisfied an
thracite miners as to a strike will be reached
to-day. If a strike is decided upon, it is likely
to Involve only a portion of the anthracite in
terests end the producers are well prepared, as
production in August was 619,000 tons over last
year and coal has been moving to market for
two weeks very heavily.
Prices of grain are little altered, good crop
reports coming in freely, but the effect is be
ing neutralized by a foreign estimate of a
world's crop below requirements. Wheat stocks
carried over were ample to meet the discrep
ancy and traders do not seem able to advance
prices more than 00 over last year's price for
wheat and Go for corn. This difference is ap
parently satisfactory to growers, as 7,430,372
bushels wheat were reoeived at Interior cities
in thÂ« first 1 week of September, against 5.945,697
bushels last year. Exports from Atlantic ports
amounted to only 1,902.540 bushels wheat, flour
included, against 2,900.960 bushels a year ago.
The Atlantic shipments of corn made a better
comparison than in recent weeks, 2,923,079 bush
els, uffnlnct 3.061.5C9 lost year. Cotton Is strong
in the face of a larger yield than expected.
Business In Iron and steel products steadily
Increases and mills are more actively employed.
October 1 is mentioned as the probable date of
a eeneral resumption. It is significant that
shipyards on the lakes and the Pacific Coast
are full of orders for eicht months or more.
As to plgiron, the outlook is no better. In
spite of a decrease In production to 231, 77S tons
weekly, according to the Iron Age, furnace
stocks have increased to 594,218 tons, a gain of
E9.877 during August, but the Increase in de
mand was not noteworthy until August 15.
Railroads have refused to make reduction in
freight rates which, It was hoped, would In
crease exports. Bessemer pig and gray forge
further declined $1 per ton at Pittsburg, al
though no change Is reported at other points.
Copper continues firm, with electrolitlc higher
at 16%c bid, and tin advanced moderately.
Last week's shipments of boots and shoes
from Boston were only 70.745 cases, against
71,277 In the previous week and for the year
thus far the decrease, compared with 1S99, has
amounted to 264.315 cases.
Sales of wool at the three chief markets de
clined to 2.S33.CO0 pounds, against 4,234,700
pounds In the previous week and 9.225,200 last
year. The dullness was not accompanied by
any pronounced weakness, although Coates
Bros.' circular for September 1 made the aver
age price 20*Â»c for all grades, against 20&c a
month earlier.
New York Grain and Produce.
In the woolen goods market there Is a rather
deceptive appearance of greater activity. The
bulk of business Is in new lines recently put
out as substitutes for standard goods and a
lower price.
Failures for the week were 145 in the United
States, against 132 last year, and 4 in Canada,
against 10 last year. â¢

Will Start a Paper.
Articles of. Incorporation of the Sun
Printing and Publishing Company, whicji
purposes printing a dally and weekly
newspaper in this city, were filed yester
day. The capital stock is $100,000. of which
$19 400 has been subscribed. The directon*
are: Charles Edclman. W. T. Baggett,
J^eigh H. Irvine. William GibBon and

oflicer decided to call assistance. The. pa
trol wagon was dispatched to the scene
and the belated carriage pulled up bo
hind. There were no shafts, and this
again puzzled Leonard. He overcame
thi3, however, by hitching It to the prison
van with ropes. Whenever the horses
slacked up their speed the carriage
"butted" into the end of the. patrol
wagon. Officers Cleveland Peters and
George Graham then sat In the rear of
the wagon and held the machine off with
their feet.
Leonard ordered the patrol driver to
pass along Ken my street and he kept his
scat in the machine until Fagan's stable
was reached. Xext day it was discovered
that tho machine had broken down, and
that the owner had left it In the street
until he could get a machinist to repair It.
VI called the article a loco-automobile
In my. report." said Leonard, "because it
would drive mo 'loco' if. I ever tried to
drive one again."
NOW, I would know what to do
If I found a stray horse," ex
plained Police Officer Ed F.
I.ieonard at the California-street
police station early Thursday
morning, "or I'd know what to
do if I found a stray wagon, or even a
stray horse attached to a stray wagon.
But I am up against It this time. I have
found a stray automobile."
Leonard, shortly after he went on his
beat, discovered an unoccupied horseless
carriage at the corner of Montgomery and
Sutter streets. He at once searched the
neighborhood for an owner, but none, put
In an appearance and the policeman was
In a quandary. Leonard knew there was
a stable for lost horses and bungles, but
he could remember no rulp that required
lost automobiles to go there. The officer
finally decided 10 take the contrivance to
the station and climbed up on the <=eat
preparatory to assuming the duties of
engineer.
"I'll make Attridge and Douglass and
the- rest of the gang green with envy aa
I spin along in this thing." he paid, head
ing the machine for Market street, that
hÂ«> might take a circuitous route. "There
isn't much glory ' in driving a patrol
wagon, but when you can be transported
in an automobile you can make them all
Up their helmets."
Leonard adjusted the steerlntr appara
tus and pulled the lever, but the wheels
refused to revolve.- He opened every
valve and turned every handle, but still
the vehicle remained as "dead" as a
freight train on a 500-foot grade. The
newsboys and late stragglers stood by
offering advice and In sheer despair Leon
ard followed It. The only results he got
was art occasional flash of light from the
side lamps. - . - '

Ruling Affecting 1 Property Sold for
DECIDES FOR SAN DIEGO.
Delinquent Taxes.
Ppocial Dlspatoh to The Call.
SAN T>IEGO, Sept. 7.â Judsre Fuller to
day sustained the city In a tax title case.
During the last decade many lots have
been sold to the city on account of un
paid taxes. Within the past few month3
there have been commenced many sult3
to n'llet title because of tho fact that the

owners to look to their titles. This suit
was entitled Clark against the City, and
the answer had set forth the claim of the
city under tax certificates of 1<W and 1W1.
Tbe demurrer was to the answer. Plain
tiff's attorneys claimed that unless tha
city applied for deeds within three years
It was barred from all title.
Judge Fuller hpld with the city, over
ruHng the demurrer and c'o=lnp: the Issues
In the case. It will now como to trial on
Its merits. A great many pieces of prop
erty In the city have the same clouds on
the' title and quite a number of suits arÂ«
awaiting action on this particular de
murrer.

BLEW OUT HIS BRAINS
IN A LODGING-HOUSE
Battle of San Juan Fought at Six
teenth and Folsomâ A Fire
Elephant.
Pain's infantry and kaleidoscope artil
lery licked the Spanish arain last evening
in the mluiie battle of San Juan at Six
teenth and Folsom streets. It would be
difficult to "Ftagre" a battle more realis
tically. Killing hills, blockhouses nnd
frowning battlements stand out in boid
relief n^ainst th:- background of the niÂ»rlit,
and in the rod lichts of the oampflres th*
s-ontries pace their beats watchful for the
cf.minsr fee. Kf-d Cross nurses attend to
tho wounded, nnd to thr melancholy sound
cf taps the "dead" are burWl. The bat
tle opens with tbe reverbernt int? crafh or
heavy artillery, the rnnid-nrers bark away
and punctuate '.he spiteful spit of the
Mauscn and Krac-Jorpensons. One by
one the blockhouses are bittered down
and wrapped In flames, while over their
ashes the boys ;n khaki rharpe to victory.
The triumphal r-.arch within the shadow?.
of San Juan Hill closes the spectacular
engagement. The acrobatic events and
the display of fireworks were not l<-=s'in
teresting than the battle. An elephant ot
fire ppradrd around the ground?, appar
ently In search cf peanuts, and was the
most interrstin? feature of this portion of
the programme.
The special features of the fireworks dis
play to-night will re pyrotechnic portraits
of 'William Jennings Bryan and Adlai
Stevenson. To-morrow night will be Na
tive Sons' night, and one of the many set
pieces will be a fire picture of Grand Pres

REV. ANDERSON'S CONDUCT
IS TO BE INVESTIGATED
OAKLAND. Sept. 7. â RepresentatK'es of
that portion of the Bethel African Meth
odist Episcopal Church at Sacramento
which opposes the Rev. W. B. Anderson
appeared before the African Methodist
Conference to-day and presented a peti
tion to Bishop Arnett demanding that the
Sacramento minister's conduct in his pas
torate be investigated. The matter will
be taken up in executive session to-mor
row morning.
"I am opposed to Mr. Anderson's re
maining In charge of the Bethel Church,"
said Deacon Tibbs. "At the beginning of
this year there were thirty-four members
on the rolls of the cnurch. Since the
Thompson divorce trouble seventeen of
these have withdrawn by letter or other
wise."
Rev. Mr. Anderson said: "I am quite
confident of the outcome of any inquiry
that may be made. I look for a complete
vindication."
Prohibition Nominee for President
Opens His California
Campaign.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 7.â John G.
Woolley, Prohibition candidate for Presi
dent of the United States, arrived in Sac
ramento this evening from the East and
opened the Prohibition campaign in this
State In an address at the Assembly
Chamber. Over 1000 persona listened to
his discourse, which in the main was an
argument against the alleged ascendency
of the saloon in political and social af
fairs.
Mr. Woolley has a pleasing address, a
fine flow of language and speaks In a quiet
and argumentative manner. He devoted
most of hi? attention to an arraignment
of the average good Christian voter, who
he said suffered corruption and intemper
ace to exist and flourish, although It lay
within his power on election day to blot
it out. He rather sarcastically referred
to Mr. McKinley as a Christian President
who stood at the back of the army can
teen, which the speaker condemned as a
murderer of manhood and a disgrace to
the nation.
Mr. Woolley said he had no personal
quarrel with the saloon-keeper, but
thought him as good a citizen as the
professing Christian who on election day
so cast his vote as to say in effect that
he believed the saloon should remain as
lawful and respectable as the church and
the public schools. He spoke of having
witnessed at the polls of a New England
town a number of school children with
badges pinned to their breasts asking
voters to cast their ballots for their pro
tection as anainst the protection of their
enemy the saloon. Yet, said the speaker,
the parents of these very children were
among those who Ignored their appeal and
voted on the side of corruption and the
saloon boss.
Ton many men. said Mr. "Woolley, were
disposed to place upon the shoulders ol
the clergy the duty of saving and pre
serving the country- from the political and
social evils that beset It. never thinking
that the preachers were not numerous
enough or strong enough for the task, nor
that the duty rested upon themselves.
He said there were in the United States
seven millions of Christian voters, to
whom it made no difference that a minis
ter did not amount to a row of pins com
pared with a saloon-keeper. He declared
that the evil of Intemperance acted as a
blight upon nearly every branch of human
activity in this country.
CANDIDATE VVOOLLEY
TALKS AT SACRAMENTO
JJESSir BARTL.ETT DAVIS, the ever popular sweet songstress of the Bosto
r.lans, has at last surrendered to the seductive offer of the enterprising vau
deville manager, and will "do her turn" at the Orpheum to-morrow. She
made her debttt in thi= line of work at Chicago during the summer and has
an interesting" Btory to tell as to how ehe -was induced to go on the Orpheum cir-
CUlL f
"It was an act of charity that landed me In vaudeville." said the lady yester
day, at the Occidental. "I had not Fung a noto in public or private for twelve,
months nnd when they were working in the interest of the Actors' Fund I be
came interested. The Masonic Temple people had been making me nil kinds of
offer? to p!ns fnr them. One day I telephoned the manager that I would sing one
week fur $1'>") and that I would contribute that sum to the Actors' Fund. My prop
osition was accepted and th<=> week was very successful. Later the management
tried me two weeks and then Manager Murdoek offered to book me for forty
week? at (1000 per week and expenses on the Orpheum circuit. I promptly ac
cepted and am glad I did. The work Is not only easy but highly "congenial, for the
public treat me in a manner that makes one feel good all over.
"However, there is the one tribulation, and that is the fact that every audi
ence compel? me to sing 'O, Promise Me.' That pong appears to have been fast
ened to me. and I have found no way to get rid of it. I will sing here two weeks
and the s=ame in Los Angeles. After I conclude the forty weeks' engagement, I
am to go to England to sing in vaudeville. If I make a fair hit there I will come
back to this country very much more in demand than I am at the present time.
I do not know why this is thus, but that is the fact."
Probably by reason of her long rest. Miss Davis is looking younger and
brighter than she has for a long time.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Sept. 7.
William Magee, well-known society
man and cotillon leader, arrived to-day
from Lake Tahoe. "His arrival was com
pulsory. as he was brought back from
the mountain resort by Deputy Sheriff
William Holland, who held a bench war
rant for his arrest. The recreant witness
was taken at once before Judge Greene
and there spent one of the liveliest half
hours of his life. Following a scoring by
the court, he was compelled to pay a
fine of $64, the expense to which his hasty
flight to Tahoe put the county of Ala
meda.
That JIapce realized that he had defied
thf law a little too far was shown by the
fact that he was represented in court by
Charles S. Wheeler, the well-known legal
light of San Francisco.
Judpe Greene showed his displeasure in
no uncertain way, and for a time the so
ciety favorite must have had painful vis-
Ions of a cell in the County Jail with a
heavy fine besides. But for the fact that
he pleaded illness to the satisfaction of
the court he probably would have felt
the Interior of a cell, but In the light of
his Illness and his ignorance of the law
governing witnesses, Magee was allowed
to go with the payment of the first day's
costs.
Judgp Hall sat with Judge Greene In
judgment on Magee. When the law's
victim wns asked to explain his depar
ture for Lake T.'ihoo In spite of his sum
mons as a witness, he said:
"I had been ordered by my physician,
Dr. H. C. Moffltt, to leave town for a va
cation, and when the Deputy Sheriff
served me with the papers I told him that
I could not bo present at Martin's trial.
I have to he careful of my health, and
thought I was justified in going away.
When I learned that T was wanted I re
turned with Deputy Holland."
"Did you not know that you were In
contempt of court?" asked Judge Greene.
"I did not, your Honor," replied Ma
pee.
The court then delivered a severe lec
ture to the defaulting- witness, caution
ing him not to repeat the offense if he
wished to remain out of Jail.
Upon Attorney Wheeler offering: on be
half of Majfee to pay the costs, the con
tempt proceedings were dismissed.
Magee's testimony in regard to the
burglary of the Hush residence was taken
by deposition this afternoon, and the so
ciety leader left to rejoin the merry
whirl at Tahoe.

'Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Sept. 7.
Notwithstanding the fact that a Coro
ner's jury exonerated I>eputy Sheriff
Striker from causing the death of William
Storms aod deckled that It was not a
bullet from his pistol that gave the fatal
wound, the UuilJins? Trades Council ha*
determined on a prosecution ol the ofHcer.
President John F. Kerns of the council
called at the District Attorney's office to

Kerr.a and Courtney left the unsigned

jobbed by the Coroner's jury last night
we have decided upon a course in thU
matter. We are almost positive that
Strikrr and no one els..- killfÂ»l Storms. anÂ»l
yve want him brought before a court of
justice. The District Attorney's office
was not represented at the Inquest last
night, and I don't think we wore given a
square deal."
Regarding the story that three snota la
all were tired in the melee at San Lorenzo
Grr.ve, Sheriff Rogers said to-day that
there were several reputable men who
could swear to Biich a, fact. Nothing: is
known *Â»f tho identity of, thf mysterious
pistol wielder or wielllors. but the Sheriff
and his deputies are looklne for tho men.
"It Is difficult at this time to accom
plish much." said Sh'-rlff rtopÂ»>r3. "but wo
ore making every effort to find the mm
who fired the 3*-ca!iber bullet which th>?
autnppy surgeon swore killed William
Stoims. The inquest showed conclusively
that Striker"s Erun did not do thf killing,
and what wp r.ow want Is the man who
fired the fatal sh^t."
The funeral of William Storms wa3 held
this afternoon from undertaking par!or3
under the auspices nf Oakland I.odse No.
272. Independent Order of Red Men. The
services were conducted by I* Nenson.
chief, and \V. Dorhelm, chaplain. Thero
was a lar^o attendance of members of tho

To keep the skin clean
is to wash the excretions
from it off; the skin takes
care of itself inside, if not
blocked outside.
To wash it often and
clean, without doing any

a soap with no free al-
kali in it.

The Attorney General showed that by
reason of the constitution the- Southern
Pacitic Company was forbidden to raise
Its rates which it had previously estab
lished for the purpose of competing with
a rival railroad, and that upon complaint
being made to the railroad company in
respect to the violation of the constitu
tional provision in question by the South
ern Pacific Company the Railroad
Commission, under its constitutional au
thority, had "heard and determined" the
questions thus presnted to it and that its
determination in the matter was not sub
ject to review by the courts.
Mr. Short on behalf of respondent fol
lowed. The argument was concluded on
behalf of the Kallroad Commission by
Judge Garber.
A study of the debates of those who framed
the constitution shows that from crude and
hastily conceived opinions there gradually devel
oped a plan which was finally molded Into shape
and designated the "Railroad Commission."
To this commission was committed the task
of compelling obedience by transportation com
panies to the law of the land, and to five it
power commensurate with Its high duty there
was drawn from the legislative power of the
State authority to make and establish rates
of transportation and to make sudh further
rules and regulations as they might deem ad
visable; while from the Judicial department
of the -t?tate was drawn the authority to "hear
and determine" complaints against railroad and
other transuortation companies. With a full
knowledge of the unusual and extraordinary
pjwer intended to be conferred upon this
tribunal, the people, by their votes, adopted
the constitution and thus the Railroad Com
mission took its plice among the governmental
powers of the State. From time to time the
power and authority of this commission were
questioned, and after a time these criticisms
ripened into a suit begun in the United States
Circuit Court in this city. The interest and
determination of the State In respect to this
suit were shown by the expenditure on the
part of the State of between tv>.<*n) and $50,000
in its prosecution. The result, however, was
disappointing, for, though" ably conducted on
behalf of the State, it never advanced beyond
the interesting stages of a preliminary Injunc
tion, and Its final determination did not appear
to be near at hand. In the present case, how
ever, the people have been more fortunate. AVith
an exr^ditlon unprecedented we have coma in
less than four months from the commencement of
our action with a Judgment in our favor in the
lower court which is to be to-day submitted
for tlnal review by this court. The issues here
are broad and deep and Involve not only the
pewer an.l authority of the Railroad Commis
sion, but the very life of that tribunal is at
stake, for if the contention of counsel for ap
pellant be correct, then may we as well strike
out from our constitution the provisions under
which the Railroad Commissioners perform
their functions.
Attorney General Ford, for the commis
sion, reviewed the history of the constitu
tional provisions in question and called
attention to the fact that thÂ© Constitu
tional Convention of 1S79 had met pursuant
to a strong public desire that some ade
quate provision should be made for the
control and regulation of the great trans
portation companies of this State. He
showed that by an examination of the
constitutional debates it appeared that a
very considerable portion of the time of
the convention was taken up with a dis
cussion of the very questions presented In
the case at bar. Continuing, he said:
J. E. Foulds, representing the railroad
company, contended that the Railroad
Commission has no power to make an or
der such as it did in the case in question.
He 6tated that the order was of no force
or effect and at best should be taken only
as advisory to the court, which should
determine the justice of changes In the
rates of the railroad companies whenever
they were objectionable to the commis
sion.
The Fresno rate case was argued yes
terday before the Supreme Court on the
contempt proceedings brought by the At
torney General against Southern Pacific
officials for refusing to obey the mandate
of the lower court that the rate of fare
charged between San Francisco and
Fresno should be $3 75, to which sum It
was lowered from $5 95 In an attempt to
throttle competition.
Question Involved Is as to Whether
Board Has the Power to Com
pel the Corporation's
Obedience.

Year Amount to Nearly Twenty=Three
Million Dollarsâ Cash'.. in. Hand.
THE gains in deposits in the California banks since July 31, 1S99, amount
to the remarkable sum of $22,973X93 88. This unprecedented showing com
pletely refutes the ravings of the political calamity howlers who de
clare that the country is going to the dogs at a rapid rate., These fig
ures were compiled from statements made to the State Bank Commis
sioners, which showed the condition of all the banks at the close of busi
ness hours on August 11 last.* In California there are 2S7 banks of all kinds,
as follows: Savings, 53; commercial. 178; national, 37, and private, 19.
According to rt-ports made in The Call recently the greatest gain ha*
been among the savings banks, which are patronized by the working peo
ple, farmers and those in the well-to-do middle walks of life. The gain
among these banks amounted to millions, which, showed that the depositors
are now possessed of the full dinner pails and homes .freed, from mortgages.
In. the completed report of the Bank Commissioners It Is shown that "the
loans of the 287 banks on real estate amount to $1CS,O51.O9S 49. The money on
hand is $2S,709.761 71 and the money: due depositors amounts to the great sum
of J279.838.0S9 35. ..' . , -
A comparison- of this report with those of former years establishes the
fact that never in the history of California has there been such general pros
perity, which Is remarkable considering the dry year in the routhern part of
the State and the general drain on the pocketbooks of aJl classes of society
for the aid of the nation necessary through its recent war with Spain, the
rebellion In the Philippines and the.rresent troubles In 1 China.

He realizes that such action will precipi

"I have been importuned." said Mr.
Webster, "by the parents of the pupils
of the r.mmmar grades who were trans
ferred lrom the Grant to the Pacific
Hrifthts School to restore them to the
Grant School and I propose to aid the cit
izt,-ns In tlv-ir efforts to get educational
advantage? from thi? administration. It
Is certain that I, as Superintendent of
School?, have the power to send back
those pupils to the school from which
they were transferred. This would involve
tlie principal, however, and 1 desire to
accomplish my purpose without causing
any burden to fall on the teachers. My
attorneyp are devising a plan to avoid
that unpleasant contingency. 1 can, how
ever, open the classrooms and then ask
the board to supply the necessary teach
ers. If it refuses to comply with my re
quest I have the power under the State
law to appoint ar.d assign teachers on my
own account.. I would then draw their sa - 1
ary warrants directly on the city treas
ury. Should the Auditor refuse to audit
and the Treasurer decline to pay because
the demands are not signed, by the board,
then a writ of mandate will be issued to
compel them to do so and an appeal made
to the State Superintendent of Schools
whose deeision.is finaJ.".
When Webster was Informed that
Chairman Mark had declared that he
would suspend any teacher or principal
who obeyed tho orders of the Superinten
dent the latter replied significantly:
"Mark would better !ook out or he will
be having himself suspended."
When Mark" was iniormed of the Su
perintendent's attitude : he reiterated his
expressed intt ntion.
Mark Makes Threats.
"I do not think Mr. Webster will -find 1
any teachers to do his bidding." paid
Mark. "We would immediately suspend
ar.y who would do so. We certainly
would 'not Fijm any demands of teachera
not regularly appointed by us. Neither
would we Kign any demands for rooms
rented by the Superintendent, so I do nut
think that any real estate man would
rent rooms under tho*e conditnions. Mr.
Webster's boast about filling the vacant
roomF in the Grant School does not scare
the Directors at all."
With regard to the suspension of Vice
Principal Knowlton Mark said that no ac
tion had been taken, but it is understood
that he will be susm-nded for a year.
This v/ill forro Knowlton Into court and
make h test case of the affair.- When
Mark was asked why Knowlton's salarv
for August and the salary demand of Sj
faturgis. who succeeded him as vice prin
cipal of the Everett School for the same
month had been passed by the board
Mark replied that it was out of charity
for Knowlton. who has a family to sup
port u hen oFked if it was legal to pass
tw .Â°. aetnands for the same position Mark
5 Â» 1 t Â£ s J t the lx)ard could pass a demand
for J1000 a month In favor of one teacher
if It so desired.
Auditor Wells informed the board yes
terday that its account for August hnd
been overdrawn to the extent of $4945 30.
The matter will be adjusted, however, us
the money required ta be Pet aside for
teachers' salaries was not all used and
there Is a surplus which can be applied
to other expenses.
To-morrow afternoon the park band will
for something like the twelve hundredth
time fling melody to the breeze. But from
such a splendid setting that the eye as
well as the ear will be charmed.
At 1:30 o'clock the augmented band of
eighty pieces will be massed under the
she!l-shaped sounding-board and as soon
after as they can fill their lungs brass and
wood will break out into "America," the
words of which are printed on the official
programme. Every one will be expected
to join in singing the hymn.
Then will come the feature of the dayâ
the presentation of this splendid gift to
the city by Claus Spreckels and its ac
ceptance on behalf of San Francisco by
General W. H. L. Barnes. This will be
the sole interpolated event of the day,
and immediately after it the musicians
will show what astonishing stunts they
can do on their trumpets when they have
such a splendid medium as the new music
stand to convey the strains of sweet music
to' their auditors.

on the McAllister-street cars "got over

BRACE OF NOTED CROOKS
LANDED AFTER A CHASE
Bobbed an Aged Woman of Hea
Purse While She "Was Standing
on Market Street.
James Coulter and Fred Campbell, twa
"f the most expert pickpockets In thÂ»
country, were arrested last night by Po
lice Officer Moriarty of the Southern sta
tion, after an exciting chase. While an
aged woman named Mra. McDonald was
standing at the corner ot Third and Mar
ket streets, Campbell, who Is a well
dressed man, accosted her and engaged
her in conversation. While her attention
was thus absorbed his companion sneaked
up behind her and deftly took her purse,
containing a few dollars, out of her
pocket.
After discovering her loss Mrs. McDon
ald notified Officer Moriartty. who started.
after the pickpockets. He chased them
along Market street to Sixth, and along
the latter street to- Howard, where they
were overtaken. On the way to the City
Prison one rtf them threw away a valuable
diamond pin. which was afterward recov
ered by the police.
Campbell 'is an Eastern crook, and Is
said- to be one of the most successful
pickpockets In the T'nited States.
Henry Altmeyer, an ex-convict and a
noted crook, is locked up in the tanks in
the City Prison, while his wife, Catherine,
an unprepossessing young woman, Is con
fined in the matron's room with a charge
of disposing of stolen property recorded
against her. Altmeyer, according to the
police, is one of the most enterprising bur
glars that ever operated In the State.
Both he and his wife were arrested last
night and locked up pending further in
vestigation.
About ten days ago Altmeyer rented a
room in a house at 501 Post street, and
during the temporary absence of one of
the lodgers he entered his room with the
aid of a skeleton key and stole a gold lead
pencil, a gold cigar-cutter, a watch anil
chain and a purse containing a few dol
lars. The burglary was reported to Chief
of Police Sullivan, who detailed Detectives
Reynolds. Dinan and Wren to arrest the
culprit. While they were looking for him
they received word that Mrs. Altmeyer
had been seen trying to dispose of a por
tion of the stolen property to a Kearny
strc-et jeweler. Meeting the husband on
the street last evening, the detectives
promptly placed him under arrest. A few
hours later they located Mrs. Altmeyer
and took her to the City Prison. To the
detectives she emphatically denied that
she. knew anything about the burglary
charged to her husband and demanded to
see an attorney, which request was de
nied. * , .
Altmeyer is the daring burglar who a
short time ago stole over $10,000 worth of
diamonds from Mrs. Hale, who was stop
ping at the St. James Hotel in San Jose.
He and his wife were stopping at the
hotel, and seeing Mrs. Hale and her maid
loaVing the hotel preparatory to taking
a drive Altmeyer forced an entrance to
her room and got away with her dia
monds. As soon as the robbery was dis
covered suspicion rested on Altmeyer. who
suddenly left town. He was tracked to
this city and arrested, but the diamonds
were not found on him. After a trial in
the Superior Court of San Jose he was
acquitted for want of evidence. He im
mediately returned to this city and while
trying to "beat" a room in a lodging
ho'use at Sixth and Minna streets he was
set upon by several of the lodgers and
badly beaten.
Tp-day the detectives expect to place
several charges of burglary against him.

Sunday Afternoon Time Set
The Police Commissioners met yesterday
afternoon, and after much discussion de
cided to allow "Pop" Sullivan, proprietor
of the Hoffman Cafe, to reopen the side
entrance to his saloon, which was ordered
closed a short rime ago.
After the meeting had been called to
order Attorney Sam Shortrldge. on be
half of Sullivan, addressed the board. He
said he had frequently visited the Hoff
man to have lunch and incidentally some
thing: to drink, and found it one of the
most respectable resorts of the kind in
San Francisco. During his visits to the
place he founcl among its patrons some of
the best men of the city. He argued that
Sullivan had a ten-year lease on the sa
!oon, which would not expire until 1S11,
â¢and to deprive him of the risrht to open
his sido entrance would be, in short, an
attempt to drive him out of business.
Shortridpre claimed that Sullivan had com
plied with the ordinance in every respect,
except as to the permanent closing of his
side entrance, which was a necessary ad
junct to the saloon. The sign. "Ladiea"
Cafe." he said, had been torn down and
would not be utilized again.
Comnr.lssiontr Wallace was in favor of
Kruntlnp Sullivan's request to open the
side entrance. He said he was satisfied
that thÂ«Â» proprietor of the cafe was anx
ious to comply with the ordinance, and
that to force him to cut out the side Â«r>
trance would simply mean that he would
have tiÂ» Clove up his place of business.
Commissioner Mahoney announced th;it
he was act ready to pass,r>n the proposi
tion, as Commissioner Newhall. the chair
man of the board, was not present. Com
missioner Wallace insisted on a vote be
ing takÂ«-n, and after a short discussion
the secretary was ordered to call the
roll.
Wallace and Dr. McNutt voted aye and
Mahoney no. The secretary then an
nounced that Sullivan was at liberty to
open the side entrance to his cafe.
Other conditions stipulated in the order
wore that the door betwron the men's
grillroom and the ladies' cafe be removed
and a side bar be established !n the men's
grill opposite the door, so that persona
entering the ladies' cafe will be in full
view of those standing at tho side bar:
that the curtains be removed from the
windows along Second street, and that
the small door south of the main entrance
to the ladies' cafe be clored.
Policeman Purvis, who mr many years
has been connected with thp department,
handed in his resignation, -which was ac
cepted. Purvis, It is said, objected to
wearing strlpps on his pants and resigned
rather than do so.

J. C. Stubbs, third vice president of the
Southern Pacific Company, returned from
the East yesterday, lie was not able to
give any information concerning the
action of the committee that will nomi
nate a successor to Collis P. Huntington.
He said that there will never be a South
ern Pacific Company president who will
have the power that C. P. Huntington

In everything', declared Mr. Stubbs. What
he .-aid was the rule to be followed. There
were two reasons, Mr. Stubbs said, why
tho next presidentAvould not have C. P.
iTiiruington's power. One was that there
would never be a C P. Huntlngton again.
The other was that the plan adopted by
largo railroad companies was to have
the finances and the higher questions
dealt with bv the chairman Â«f an exe
cutive committee. That >'!:m bad been
adopted by the Union Pacific. New York
Central ana Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
Paul; in fact, that had come to be con
sidered thi proper thine:. The president of
a large railroad company was an execu
tive man solely. Me was something like
u general of an army.
While Mr. Stubbs had no information
concerning the new president to be se
lected, he had certain' decided opinions on
that .subject. He believed that H. E.
Himtingtou would be named. "If I owned
the Southern Pacific Company," said Mr.
fetubbs, "1 would appoint li. E. Hunting
ton as president, lie is the best qualified
for the place of all the men connected
with the company at this time. An in
sider, who is acquainted thoroughly with
the business ana who knows us all and
is liked by us all, is better prepared to be
the president than any outsider could be."
Mr. Stubbs was asked about his address
at Chicago favoring measures to foster
the growth of the American marine. "The
existing conditions." he said, "are. as I
tried to make plain at Chicago, dlsgract-

After her rolense she joined the Salvation
