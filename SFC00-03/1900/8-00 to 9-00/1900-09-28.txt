to-night the report of the negotiations for

consensus of opinion was that Influences
reported to be at work to effect a settle

Interests 1 cannot advance any argument
that will cause the operators to turn from
the course they have mapped out, namely,
fighting to a finish the threatened in

United Mine Workers' organization. The
general opinion here is that the Influences

that the operators cannot well stand out

strike will be settled. The means of set-

the strike was at the collieries, of O. B.
Markle & Co. As predicted by the strike
leaders yesterday, there was a consider
able reduction in the forces working at
the various collieries operated by this
firm. The strikers say that the mines are
practically Idle, while all that the general
superintendent of the mines said was that
the.' collieries were started as usual to
day. Of the thirty odd collieries in this
region thirteen are completely tied up and
the remainder are more or less crippled,
not one running full, not many of them
having mined any coal to speak of since
the strike started.
The entlre'Hazleton region was quiet to
day, and the only noticeable change In

chell said
In speaking about the rumors of a set
tlement Mr. Mitchell said the strike could
not be ended without his knowing It and
that he had no knowledge of any effort
that might now be in progress which
would lead to an Immediate settlement.
Mr. Mitchell's attention was called to a
dispatch in which J. Pierpont Morgan Is
credited with saying that Mitchell would
accept a 10 per cent advance. Mr. Mit-
lU.ort fs current that operators have made
concessions in was; scale and will attempt to
induce mine-workers to resume work. Please
advice a\\ miners In your district that no at
tention should be cl vp n to ibÂ«>Â«Â«" report*, and
that they will be officially notified should any
o.Tcr oi settlement be made. ' Under no con
sideration whatever should work be resumed
unless authorized by a-commlttee representing
all mlne-worktr.i In the anthracite district. It
Is vitally important that all miners stand flrn.
and determined and not bÂ« deceived by those
whoso Interest it is to defeat the purpose for
which the striko was Inaugurated. " . ..
This was a day of rumors. Around
strike headquarters .there were stories in
circulation that Archbishop Ryan and
Senator Hanna were coming here to see
President Mitchell; that all the coal car
rying roads had agreed to arbitrate all
differences and that the strike had been
settled. The laft mentioned; rumor was
the only one which the leaders paid any
attention- to and in connection with it
they sent a telegram to the president of
the union In the three districts compris
ing the entire anthracite coal field of
Pennsylvania. The telegram is as follows:
Considerable interest Is being manifest
ed as to the effect of President
Mitchell's action in attempting to defeat
the alleged move of 'the coal-carrying
roads. . '
Labor leaders do not anticipate any
ruspenslon of work in the soft coal field
unless the operators Insist upon sending
their coal to the anthracite market. They
also say that the Philadelphia and Read-
Ing,' Delaware and Hudson and Jersey
Central railroads being unable to till their
contracts for hard coal, are prevailing
upon their customers to accept the soft
coal wherever it can be used as a sub
stitute.
and President Mitchell feels sure that as
noon, as they find that the coal they may
be leading or asked to load is to take the
place of hard coal they will refuse to han
dle it.
CARDINAL JAMES GIBBONS OF BALTIMORE. WHO HAS CONSENTED
TO ACT AS ARBITRATOR OF THE STRIKE OF THE ANTHRACITE
COAL MINERS OF PENNSYLVANIA.
VIENNA. Sept. 27.â The Admiralty has received a dispatch from Taku giv
ing the strength of the forces landed there by the allied powers as follows: Aus
trian. W, German. SITS; British. S353: American. 5â¬C8; French, 6576; Italian, 2541;
Russian, 20,934; Japanese, 15^70. Total. 68,23.

TIENTSIN. Sept. 25. â Vice Admiral Seymour arrived at Taku on September 23
and Is expected here to-morrow \5lth Count von Waldei>ee. General Gasele? !s ex
pected on Thursday.
The reason assigned for the small number of casualties among the Chinese at
the taking of the Peltang and L-utal forts is that Li Hung Chang had ordered the
evacuation' of the forts. '
PEKING. SeVt. 22. via Taku. Sept. 25.â The American Minister has in his pos
session a subscription list of the Boxers, which shows the name of Prince
Chlng as having made three subscriptions. The list was discovered by Mis
sionary Wherry. Friends of Prince Chlng declare that he was coerced Into giving.
It Is reported by the French that a patrol has been fired on outside the east
ern gate of the city. Otherwise everything is quiet.
VON WALDERSEE ARRIVES TO-DAY.
CHING SUBSCRIBED TO BOXERS.
Field Marshal Count von Waldersee, commander in chief of the international
forces, will arrive here to-morrow. He will be received by a review of the
troops of all the allied nations.
It Is reported that the Russians after the capture of the Lutsl forts began
ru3hing troops along the railroad for the purpose of occupying Shankian.
TIENTSIN. Sept. 24, via Taku, Sept. 25.â General Chaffee has arrived and
conferred with the staff officers of different departments with a view of estab
lishing a winter base in the vicinity of Tientsin. He paid a visit to Tongku.
making a general inspection. The present plan is understood to be tentative and
based upon the possible retention of the existing force. The plan contemplates
placing the troops under canvas outside the city. General Chaffee paid a visit
to Li Hung Chang and informally discussed the outlook for a settlement. It is
understood he proffered an American officer to accompany the Viceroy to Pe
klrig. No other power except Russia has yet officially recognized Ll'3 presence.
CHAFFEE CONFERS WITH EARL LI.
Acting Secretary Hill is about, to send to Minister Conger instructions which
will guide him in commencing preliminary negotiations with Prince Chin? and
Earl Li Hung Chang. These instructions contemplate the return of the Imperial
Government to Peking, though it is explained this Is in no sense a condition
precedent to opening negotiations looking to a permanent settlement. MlnlstÂ«r
Conger received last week the replies of the United States to foreign Govern
ments, and therefore understands the readiness of the President to begin pre
liminary negotiations. The President Is considering whether, in view of Tuan's
appointment it is advisable to demand Immediately upon the assumption of
negotiations his degradation and punishment. It is insisted that Minister Conger
Is in no sense acting as a mediator, though any agreement reached by him will
undoubtedly be communicated by the State Department to the other powers.
There is reason to believe that Minister "Wu understands the serious phase
of the International situation growing out of the attitude of Germany and the
action of the Chinese Imperial Government in playing into the hands of the
Berlin authorities by appointing Prince Tuan Grand Secretary and President of
the Privy Council and giving positions of power and responsibility tp other
reactionaries. He also understands the willingness of the United States to give
its best assistance to the Imperial Government if it will in return aid America
by removing Prince Tuan and restoring order throughout the empire. Minister
Wu insists that the new appointment given to Sher.g, Taotai of Shanghai, is a
promotion instead of a dnerradatlon. but the State Department, by taking no ac
tion in the matter, has tacitly approved the protest of the American Consul
General against Sheng's removal.
It is stated by authority that the United States will not under any considera
tion acquire Chinese territory. What the President will seek when partition
comes is the future protection of American trade rights. This can be accom
plished by obtaining from all the powers seizing territory agreements that
treaty obligations respecting trade which exist between China, and the United
States shall be observed by the several owners of the fragments of the ancient
empire. There is no doubt that all the powers would at least be gratified to see
the United States take Chinese territoryâ that opposite the Philippines- t.ut the
administration is apparently willing to exchange its chances of so doing for a
guarantee that American commerce shall be respected. It is proposed to insist
on this point, and the moral effect of a formidable fleet in Astatic waters will be
sufficient to carry it out.
Great Britain. It Is held, has shown what territory she covets by occupying
Shanghai, the key to the Yangtse-Kiang Valley, which is the road to India. Threo
powers would dislike to have Great Britain establish her sovereignty over that re
gion, and Germany and France have announced their opposition by landing troops
at Shanghai. Japan stands ready to occupy the province of Fuklen and FrancÂ© is
willing to extend her boundaries in Southern China northward.
So Russia Is prepared to move either way, while she 13 ready for vigorous pro
tests should Germany or any other power attempt to take territory north of Shan
tung.
Russia thoroughly understands Germany's policy, and Is so disposing of her
forces that the recommencement of operations by Germany and German occupa
tion of territory may be used as a pretext for the extension of Russian soverelf i
ty-over the whole of Northern China. At the same time Russia Is posing to the
Chinese as thiir good friend. If a peaceful settlement be reached she will expect a
reward for tli!s profession of friendship In the shape of territorial concessions,
such as she obtained when Japan was forced to relinquish Manchuria.
cated such an end. Emperor William desires to wreak terrible revenge upon of

not to load coal for shipment into markets
HAZLETON. Pa.. Sept. 27.â President
Mitchell of the United Mine Workers to
day sent a telegram to the Central Penn
sylvania bituminous coal fields which pos
sibly will have the effect o.f bringing the
t<oft ccal mine workers Into the contest
which the anthracite workers are now
waging against the mine owners. Â¦ The
telegram was sent to Richard Gilbert,
secretary of district 2, Clcartield, Pa. It
was as follows:
Strong Opposition to the Plans of the
Railroads.
WOULD SHUT OUT SOFT COAL.
After the meeting, which lasted until
midnight. President Mitchell said that the
meeting was held for the purpose of dis
cussing the question of holding the men
together if negotiations for a settlement
should be on foot. Mr. Mitchell has not
been officially informed of the operators'
action. It Is understood that the offer
made by the operators does not carry with
it recognition of the union.
Mitchell's statement was made while he
was holding a conference- with his lieu
tenants. Those at the conference weic

Further than this Mr. Mitchell declines
to talk. He has been reticent all day on
the subject and several times declared
that he knew nothing of the rumors of a'
settlement of the strike.
HAZLETON. Pa.. Sept. 27.â The Asso-,
dated Press at 10 o'clock to-night secured
from President Mitchell the admission
that he believes that the mine operators
have agreed to make the striking miin:
workers an offer of a 10 per cent increast
in wages.
"Senator Hanna Is not the man 1 refer
to," he added, "and I have not seen Arch
bishop Ryan at all."
"I know of no settlement of the strike
having yet been made. However, nego
tiations toward the Fettling of the strike
are actually under way. They ar" being

"Will you consent to act if both sides

"In that case I shall take the matter

It is bolived that Archbishop Ryan was m instrumental in securing Cardinal Gibbons as arbitrator.
NEW YORK, Sept. 27. â In New York to-day everything indicated the near settlement of the miners'
strike in Pennsylvania. A dispatch from Baltimore to-night says Cardinal Gibhons has accepted the position
of arbitrator.
Republican national campaign leaders asserted positively that Senator Hanna's labors with the opera

PARIS. Sept. 27.â The French Consul at Shanghai cables under date of Sep

HONGKONG. Sept. 27.â The American Presbyterian and Catholic missions at

Catholic mission escaped and was protected by a mandarin.
Numerous anti-Christian disturbances are taking place in the provinces of
Kwarigsl and Kwangtung. The authorities are employing active measures to
suppress the outbreaks and there have been several executions.
Native Christians are flocking to Canton.
The foreign Consuls recently protested against the removal of the Taotai of
Shanghai and the appointment as his successor of the notorious Boxer, Rang
n. The Viceroy of Nankin. Liu Kun YI. replied that at least a month would

WASHINGTON. Sept. 27.â Of the sJt warships which were orde-ed last week

The gunboat Vicksburg is fittinsr out at the Norfolk yard, and the gunboat
Annapolis !s at the Eoston yard. The preparations aboard the latter will require
several weeks.
WARSHIPS ORDERED TO THE ORIENT.
BERLIN. Sept. 27.â The German press and Foreign Office continue to deny
that Great Britain has rejected Germany's proposal. They also continue to blame
the United States for the recently revived Chinese obduracy and the renewed evi
dence that the Chinese intend to resume hostilities on a large plan. The Berliner
T&geblatt alone advises Germany not to expect a favorable answer to her pro
posal from Lord Salisbury, "as his wish to carefully nurse intimate relations
Â¦rfth the United States Corns the keynote of h's policy."
The Kreuz Zeltumr. which had ail along; advocated a moderate policy in China,
now advises a strong hand, claiming: that "history teaches that China can only
by rone be Sndurc-d to give redrrss for outrages on foreigners."
1 1 is noticeable that the press generally discusses Russia's independent action
rr.V.CXy and do<s not even condemn her measures in Manchuria and Mongolia,
while the latest move of the United States for independent action is severely
condemned by the same papers. Some of the seml-cfficiaJ sheets like the Cologne
Gazette and the Strassbure Post have even beenme sarcastic, and are asking
whether America expects to negotiate successfully for peace with Prince Tuan.
From two high diplomatic sources it was learned to-day thai all the answers
trbtcb bare been received to Germany's proposition have one feature in com
mon. While accepting in. principle the demand for a prooer punishment of the
rrpiradc!;;. they rcfune to postpone all peace negotiations until after the set-
Tlerr.tnt of th'.s Â«>ne point. The replies of Japan r.nd France are in agreement as
to tVs. Therefore, it cannot be truthfully said that Count von Bulow's latest
move has proved ?n unqualified success.
Th" Foreipn Office tcl4 a correspond ?nt this afternoon that Great Britain's
ar.5T.cr !:ad not yet arrived, but that as soon as it did the Government would be
giad to publish it. no matter what its character. Sir Frank Lasceiles, the Brit
ish Emlmrsaiior. who was Interviewed re^ardine the matter, said: "Great Brit
ain's delay in ar.swerir.fr Germany's proposal is due to the fact, as I undeÂ«stand
it. that Lord Salisbury has asked Sir Claude Mardonald to report upon the feasi
bility of the German plan." Â»

LEADVIL.LE. Colo., Sept. 27.â Tho
Roosevelt special train passed over tho
divide without Incident, though there was
some nervousness on the part of the
railroad officials and trainmen and some
of the escorting party when the train
passed through Victor, where the riot oc
curred last evening. On its return trip
in the night over the Colorado Midland
the train was well guarded with resolute
men armed with Winchesters, and any
one looking for trouble on the outside
could have been etfsily accommodated.
The Governor, after the labors and ex
citement of the day, retired to his coach
at 11 o'clock and slept as tranquilly as if
nothing had happened. The schedule for
the day provided for ten stops and aa
many speeches. Leadvllle was reached
at 11 o'clock and a stop was made of an
hour and forty-five minutes. A large
crowd was assembled at the station and
preparations had been made for a bis
outdoor meeting. Governor Roosevelt and
party were driven to the corner of Har
rison and Fifth streets, where a stand
had been erected. People in great num
bers lined the streets the entire distance
and the crowd abound the stand was
great. Rev. Mr/ Fleming, chaplain of a
Colorado Philippine regiment; presided
and Introduced Senator Wolcott, who
made a warm speech, ending by Introduc
ing Governor Koosevelt. benator Henry
Cabot Lodge, who was with Governor
Roosevelt in the riot yesterday, also made
a short speech.
PUEBLO. Colo., Sept. 27.â When tho
special train bearing the Roosevelt party
arrived at this place this evening tho
station was crowded with people to see
the Governor. The reception commutes
escorted the party to Royal Park, where
a procession was formed and marched
through the principal streets of the city.
On the way the streets were lined with
people. Three meetings were arranged for
and all were attended by large audiences.
During the day at the various stopping
places the crowds were remarkably large
and an unusual interest attended tho
meetings. Governor Roosevelt - in his
speech at Leadville to-day said in part:
I cannot say how I have enjoyed the privi
lege of coming through your great and beauti
ful and wonderful State and now to be In what
is the most famous mining city of the entl -e
globe. Glad though I am to Bee your State
with its varied resources, with mountain and
plain, with mine and ranch. I am more pleased
etlll to eee thu men and women who made It
what it is.
When I come out here among you I feel that
1 come out not to teach you Americanism, but
to teach you the doctrine of work, of honorable
striving: and honorable effort and to follow
where you have led the way. 1 want you to
think for yourselves. Supposing that the Re
publican party had done what our opponents
desire us to do now, that la, abandon the
Philippines? They would now be denouncing
us In extravagant terms and blaming us. all oi
them, from Mr. Bryan down. In that case
they would have been as right aa they are
wrong now. I come before you to ask your
supi-ort for the principles we represent upon
two great grounds â upon the ground of self-
Ir.t-^rest of each and all of us and upon the
Hn.und of our feelings for that eymbol of
the American flag that floats over
us all. Remember that in this union there can
be no division of either, honor or Interest on
State lines. We will all (to up or go down to
gether. We will so up. or go down as regards
material prosperity and we will hang our heads
or hold them high accordingly as. the American
flag does or does not stand In the future as It
has stood in the post, a symbol of honor, of
greatness, of truth and liberty. When In 1893
hard times came they came In Xew York, Colo
rado and Call/ornla alike. When in 1897 pros
perity returned It returned to the Rocky Moun
tains, as It returned to the seaboards of tho
Atlantic and Pacific. It returned to the farmer,
the ranchman, the wage earner, - precisely as
much as to the business man. There can bÂ»
no permanent lines of well-being on the one
hand for some of our people and adversity on
the other hand for the rest of our people. Fun
damentally we will go up or down alike. Now,
when It comes to the question of the honor of
the flag the same considerations hold true.
At Canyon City Governor Roosevelt
spoke in part as follows:
There has been some talk as to what the para
mount iesue is in this campaign. Now I will
tell you. and I have made up my mind wfthin
the last forty-eight hours (laughter) what' the
paramount Issue is. The paramount issue Is
to keep the orderly liberty that has made us
what we are. The paramount Issue Is to keep
our national self-respect by each individual
ketping his own self-respect and respecting his
fellows; keeping the right of free speech, keep
ing the right of political discussion so that we
may be able to settle our political differences
squarely and fairly after a full hearing given
to any one, whatever his views may be,, if he
expresses them decently and In proper lan
guage. There 1Â« danger of Imperialism. ' aye.
but It is not from the direction. In which Mr.
Bryan Is looking. There Is no danger In the

Paramount Issues as
He Has Lately
Found Them.
MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 27/â United
States Senator Beveridgo of Indiana de
livered a political address to a large audi
ence to-night in the Exposition building,
the hnll In which Benjamin Harrison was
nominated for President.
His speech was almost two hours' long,
tho greater part of it being devoted to our
present prosperity and the method by
which It can be continued. He said that
it could not be continued by any formula
of administration, but that a continuing
prosperity depended upon constantly add
ing to the markets for American prod
ucts.
''This," said he "is the purpose of the
Republican party. It invents new policies
to meet njew and changing conditions. It
is the party of commercial growth as well
as territorial growth. That is why the
Republican administration always means
American prosperity and that is why the
Democratic administration always means
commercial disaster."
Senator Beveridga said that the present
prosperity could not be continued merely
by standing still; it could not be continued
by. going backward, as the Democratic
party proposed; it could only be continued
by soir.g forward and opening still newer
avenues for American energy. He said
there cannot be a better test than thisâ
let all whoso condition has improved un
der McKinley vote for McKinley and all
whose conditions have grown worse un
der McKinley votu against him. The
Democratic party produced a. deficit in
time of peace, the Republican party pro
duced a surplus In time of war, he de
clared.
On the attitude of the two parties in
reference to our foreign possessions he
said:
The Republican party and the flag: In the
skiesâ the Democratic party and the flag in the
dustâ this is the attitude of the party of Lin
coln and the attitude of the party of Calhoun
at the close of the nineteenth century. Na
tional domain, the concentration of the people
the extension of territory have been the in
stinctive and persistent efforts of the American
people slnee first they flung their separate ban
ner out among the flags of men. All other
questions have been Incidental and temporaryâ
issues of a decade or a day, and on them po
litical parties have lost and won and had their
little equally unimportant victory or defeat
but every political party that has stood for
the traditional policy of the republic the people
have sustained and every party that has op
posed their onward march the American people
have overthrown.
Senator Beveridge said that this was a
non-partisan . campaign â an American
campaignâ and tb.at this was the reason
why the Republican party had such a
hold upon the -people's hearts, because
the Republican party In this campaign
stood for Americanism.
ADLAI STEVENSON ACCEPTS.
Iietter From Him Received at Popu
list National Headquarters.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Sept. 27.-In a letter
received, to-day at the Populist National
headquarters Adl.il K. Stevenson 'accepts
the nomination for the Vice Presidency
tendered to him by that party early this
month.
Mr. Stevenson says in part: "Upon -the
Important questions of finance, of domes
tic administration and of reform In our
methods of taxation the platform of the
People's party gives no uncertain sound.
It is no less emphatic in its demand for a
return to the policy of honest and econ
omical expenditures of the public money
The further demand for wise and efficient
legislation looking to the suppression of
trusts cannot fail to challenge the atten
tion of all thoughtful men.
"In- common, however, with the Silver
Republican and . the Democratic parties
you recognize the important fact that all
these are but questions of the hour. In
the: presence of the overshadowing Issue
of Imperialism others are but as the dust
in the balance. It is not strange, then,
that there should now be a concert of ac
tion between those who sincerely believe
â¢that a crisis has been reached in which
party considerations are of secondary im
portance.' "

VICTOR, Colo.. Sept. 27. -^As a re
sult of the riot last night in which
Colonel Roosevelt "was struck and
his train stoned F. N. Briggs. edi
tor of the Victor Daily Record, was
assaulted in his own office a little
after noon to-day. In an editorial
this mornnig the Record denounced
the participants in the .rlo't in
scathing language, and stated that
"a few dissolute women waved
rags in the very faces of these dis
tinguished guests. " Mr. Briggs
was the only member of the office
force in the room when E. E. Carr
came in. Carr declared that.hlsi
wife had been called a dissolute
woman, and after ascertaining- that j
Mr. Briggs was the editor of the
paper struck him on the. back of
the head before he could arise from
his chair. Carr got in two. more
blows while the editor was getting
.up. As soon as Briggs recovered
himself he landed heavily on Carr's
jaw. Father Downey, pastor of
the Catholic church, who came in.
interfered and prevented further
violence. Carr demanded a re
traction of the. editorial statement
and left the office vowing that, he
would have satisfaction or revenge. .
Carr is a miner.
cne-hundredths of a soldier for every thousand
citizens of this great republic. No, no. We
have not yet reached that pitch of timidity
when we are afraid of thut. There is no dan
ger of militarism. There is no danger or Im
perialism from thin country starting out on
the path our lathers trod to do the work of
a great world power. The only danger oi im
perialism that will ever come in this country
is if it is invited a3 a reaction against an
archy. Anarchy is the handmaiden of tyranny.
If ever we grow to substitute lawless mob vio
lence for the orderly liberty that we enjoy un
der the law, if ever we grow to substitute the
rule of brutal force for the rule of the ballot,
where the ballot Is caet treely and counted as
cast. If ever we grow to exchange for govern
ment by debate in the legislatures of the coun
try and on the stump, if we ever grow to ex
change for those the violence that finds ex
pression either in word or deed, then we will
Indeed be within measurable distance of
kBing our liberty. Then and not till then the
Â¦worst thing this country can have is the man
sitting at ease at home, exciting other men
who nre ignorant to deeds of violence, and
whether this exciting of violence be by a
politician or the editor of a newspaper the
effect is the same.
At Salida another organized, attempt
was made by a small minority to Inter
rupt the proceedings. This mob was com
posed mostly of boys from twelve to
eighteen years of age, with a few men,
who shouted for Bryan and cheered so as
to Interrupt the spiakers. One of thu
youngsters, being asked why he was act
ing so disorderly, stated that he was hired
to do so. They wore uniform caps and
acted In concert. .
BRYAN IN NEBRASKA.
Democratic Nominee Addresses Audi
/ ences in Many Places.
DAKOTA CITY, Nebr., Sept. 27.-W. J.
Bryan arrived here. to-night and address
ed a meeting In the Courthouse yard. He
made three speeches during the day, trav
eling almost forty miles # by carriage and
150 miles by rail. The weather was cold
and raw throughout, rain falling at inter
vals.
The entire. day was devoted to the Third
Congressional District, and it was largely
a canvass in behalf of Edgar Howard's
candidacy for Congress. From Papilllon
Mr. Bryan drove to Blair in company with
Mr. Howard, a distance of. thirty miles,
making two brief speeches on the way,
one at Millard and the ether at Bennlng
ton. The drive consumed. more than four
hours, and it was almost 4 o'clock when
Blair was reached. Here there was a
large assemblage of people. In a half
hour's speech Mr. Bryan went hurriedly
over the principal issues of the campaign,
giving special attention to trusts and im
perialism.
-At the nisht meeting in Dakota City
Mr. Bryan said that the Republican party
did not dare take its full-ainner-pall ar
gument into the anthracite coal regions
of Pennsylvania ', and declared that,
whether a man was. a laboring man, a
farmer or a merchant, he must see thaj:
opportunities are constantly narrowing
under the trust system. Discussing the
question of imperialism. ' Mr. Bryan as
serted that the same power which- put
the Porto Rlcans outside the constitution
this year might next year put the people
of Nebraska or any -other State outside
the pale of the constitution. ''Destroy the
doctrine that all men are created equal
and It will soon be Â¦ necessary to carry
your pedigree around with you." he said.
He declared that in the Paris treaty with
Spain the United States had not secured
any title to the Philippines, but had se
cured only a license to hunt there.
Mr. Bryan left here after the conclusion
of his speech for Sioux City, Iowa, where
he will spend the night and speak to-mor
row. â¢
here to-night. Not a ton of coal was
mined in Shenandoah to-day.
PAYING OFF THE STRIKERS.
Corroboration of Story That Attempt
Will Be Made to Start Up.
BCRANTON. Pa.. Sept. 27.â The an
nouncement that the railroaders cannot
see their way clear to help close down
the washeries by refusing to handle their
output caused a call to be issued to-day
for a meeting of the executive board of
the Vntted Mine Workers of District 1
for next Saturday to discuss other means
of meeting the difficulty. An effort Is to
be made to stop worlÂ« at the Barton and
Murrin mines, near Carbondalp, by show
ing to the mine inspector that these small
collieries are not operated according to
the requirements of the law relating to
ventilation.
The big companies are paying oft* the
strikers. All of the former employes of
the Pennsylvania Coal Company's
twenty-seven collieries will be paid to
morrow, and those of the Lackawanna's
twenty-three places will be paid before
Monday. The purpose of this is to make
the men amenable as trespassers if they
come on the company's property, and is
another strong corroboration of the story
that a move Is on to operate some of the
mines. It has been positively demon
strated that soft coal will burn in culm
grates, and the dread of Scranton's indus
tries being compelled to shut down is
now removed.
TO REINFORCE THE DEPUTIES.
Another Carload of Officers Sent
From the Schuylkill Valley.
SHAMOKIN. Pa,, Sept. 27.-Another
carload of deputies from the Schuylkill
Valley arrived in Trevorton to-night to
reinforce a large number of deputies who
have guarded the last week. It Is feared
trouble may ensue between the strikers
from this place and the deputies should
an attempt be made to tie up the North
Franklin Colliery, which is nowi the only
on'- 1 in operation in this section of the
coal fields. It employed 600 men and boys.
Since the strike was inaugurated a num
ber of the men ceased work, but all
excepting thirty returned to the mine yes
terday. The strike leaders claim the mine
will not be working by Monday.
tlement. it is said, will be as follows:
The hig carrying companies will grant
a Klight reduction in tolls; ihe operator*,
Â¦will raise the pric of coal, and the waRes
of the miners will be increased according
to the percentage that the reduction In
tolls and increase in selling price will per
mit, the figuring to be done with the ex
isting scale of crageS as the basis. It will
l>e exacted that the Mine Workers' Union
pnall not ligure in the negotiations and
that the men shall return to work with
out any ceremony further than a guaran
tee nf the advance in wages that will bo

rwo mg Collieries in Ashland Dis
trict Compelled to Close.
SHENAXDOAH, Pa.. Sept. 27.â To-
developments 1n the strike situation
in this repion showed important pains on
the part of the mine workers. Two bis
collieries In the Ashland district, con
trolled by the Philadelphia and Reading
0*1 and Iron Company, were compelled
to ck.se down, and a third worked with
a crippled force. The Locust Spring col
liery, at Locust Gap, nine miles from
Ashland, was unable to work owing to
the rmall number of men who reported.
This company ordinarily employs about
1300 men and br.ys.
The Hast colliery at Lociistdale closed
down this afternoon, and the Potts col
liery, at Big Mine, worked with a small
force. It is estimated that 1500 men are
employed at tr.ese two mines. The union
mine workers In the Asliland district gay
they have been willing for some time to
ttrike. but were restrained by lack of
organization, a branch of the union was
formed last night. Organizer Fahey will
address a meeting of the mine workers
at Ashland to-morrow night.
In the territory between Shamokin and
McAdoo there is but one colliery at work.
the North Franklin, at Trevorton, and
this is said to be short-handed. In the
Mahanoy district ail the collieries are
tightly closed.

PART?. Pept. 27.â The practical deadlock in the efforts to epen peace negotia
tions with China has piven an impetus to the fuipgestion that the Ministers at
Peking be instructed to hold meetings for the purpose of drawing up the terms
<;f t!ie troaty of peace. The fact that the powers, through th-? exchange of views,
between their respective Foreign Offices, are unable to reach n.ny agreement haÂ«.
it Is claimed, dearly emphasized the difficulty of settling on terms regarding oc
currences at .^o preni a distance, and. it is added, it has shown that the Minis
ters on the spot are the- persons most fitted for and capable of working out a
common ground of .tttlement. General irst ructions only, it is further suggested,
have Iw^n eivon to the Ministers, the details to b<? loft largely to their discretion.
An official of the Foreign Office here expressed the hope to-day that f=uch in
struct iÂ»r.s would l>o f'Tthcnmir.g within a week ard that jjtneral Instructions*
troutd be ur.der tfcret- head?â first, punishment of the conspirators: second, com

Thf Â«1ft<rminatior. of the United States l to withdraw her troops from China,
while at the wmc time Increasing the strength of her fieet in Chinese waters, is
rilher disconcerting the powers. But the interpretation put upon it in official cir

to the- extremity and Is therefore proparitiK a fleet for the purpose of maintain

That Westminster Confession
of Faith Shall Remain
Intact.
Decide After a I*engthy Discussion
LOS ANGELES. Sept. W.-AftÂ«> a dis
cussion lasting through the entire day and
until late to-night, the Los Angeles Pres
bytery defeats creed revision. Of the four
questions in regard to a modification of
the Westminster confession of faith sub-
mitteU to the various presbyteries by the
General Assembly, the last question,
which provides that the creed shall re
main Intact, was answered affirmatively
when the final vote was taken.
Rev. Dr. Noble, secretary of the Gen
eral Assembly, favored moderate revision,
as did Rev. Hugh Walker, though the
latter declared he based his action upon
tha desire for harmony and was person
ally opposed to revision. Rev. Robert
Reese declared he wished for a voice of
thunder that he might stand on Mount
Lowe and proclaim throughout the earth
his opposition to a doctrine which nad
satisfied the church for 2tX> years.
Rev. John Shirley Ward declared that
the ministers of the Presbyterian church
did not and dared not preach the doctrine
of the church, referring especially to thÂ»
doctrine of election.
Rev. J. M. Newell said the faith was not
only sufficient for Presbyterians but that
it had proved sufficiently attractive* for
fifty-seven ministers of outside denomina
tions to apply for admission Into the
Presbyterian fold during 1 the last year.
Dr. Robert StronR'iut himself squarely
on record as favor*^ a new creedâ onÂ»
that is applicable to the twentieth cen
tury needs.

HOUSTON. Tex., Sept. 27.â The Braroa
River is still rising at Waco and an over
flow now seems certain. The rise has been
more rapid this evening than at any time
previously, and a message from Kopperel
reports a fresh rise there and a more
rapid one than the first. The river at
Waco lacked a few inches of leaving its
banks at 8 o'clock, and with the present
outlook an overflow is almost certain.
The water is ten feet below the high
water mark of 1S99, but does not have to
reach that point to overflow thousands of
acres of the bottom farms. Advices from
the Lower Brazos to-day are to the ef
fect that backwater has inundated the
lowlands, flooded last spring, but has not
broken over its banks. Tne river has,
with the exception of a few hours yester
dav morning, been constantly rising for
six days, a record-breaker as to length of
time.
The Trinity is reported rising at Fort
Worth and Dallas. A special from the
former place says the bottoms are inun
dated to a depth of three to four feet and
the situation nas a serious aspect.
Tl.e reports from the Lower Trinity say
that the first flood is passing without
damage. The rise in the Colorado River
has reached Columbus and two piers In
the Southern Pacific bridge have" gone,
interrupting 1 their traffic to the west.
AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. 27.â Returning this
morning from Galveston Governor feayers
reported conditions in that city as greatly
improved. The relief committee is doing
excellent work and the people generally
talk hopefully. There were about 17u0
men at work clearing away the debris on
Wednesday.
It is his opinion that it will require 4000
men to remove all the debris within the
next thirty" days, but it may require a
longer time. Means have been provided
for prompt payment in cash for ench
day's work, and no man is asked or re
quired to work without fuil compensa
tion in money* The supplies are being
systematically distributed only to those
who have suffered from the storm and
are helpless, the policy being to pay those
who are strong and willing to work and
to help only those who are infirm and
needy and cannot provide for themselves.
Commerce is being resumed, and on
Wednesday the Governor saw large ships
loaded with grain and cotton.
The Governor remained at Houston sev
eral hours and found that the work of
the relief committee was being admirably
done and that the ladies' committee had
performed its duties so as to justly en
title it to the very highest praise.
OFFICIAL REPORT OF STORM.
Wind Beached a Velocity of 120
Miles an Hour.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27.â The Weather
Bureau has received from its local fore
cast official at Galveston, I. M. Cline, a
report on the great hurricane of Septem
ber 8.
Mr. Cline was one of the sufferers by
the disaster. His house, which was one
of the substantial structures in the beach
section of the residence district became
the refuge of ,iifty peopie about the height
of the storm. It went down in the gen
eral wreck and thirty-two of its inmates,
including Mrs. Cline, were killed. Cline
and his assistant* J. C. Cline. rescued
three children and one woman and
escaped to the center of the city after
drifting about in the gulf for three hours
on the floating wreckage. John D. Blag
den, one of tne observers at the station,
stood by the office till all the Instruments
bad been blown away. Mr. Blagden,
knowing the importance of the barometer
record and fearing to trust the barograpn
or automatic recording instrument, tooK
readings of the mercurial barometer
through the height of the storm at five
minute intervals. The instrument showed
a minimum reading of 2S.53, the lowest
ever recorded in this country.
People were advised to seek substantial
shelter in the center of the city for the
night and thousands from the low beach
section heeded this warning and were
saved when the general crash came. It
is estimated that the wind reached a ve
locity of 120 miles.
Mr, Cline's map of the area of totai
destruction, checked by the estimate of
the insurance underwriters, indicates that
S&JS houses were totally destroyed. Tne
loss of life, he says, never will be exactly
known, but It is estimated at over 6000.
The property damage will exceed $30,
000,000.

night he Raw Zumwalt groping about and

When they reached the Bacuacha Moun
tains Murphy held up George, took the
money ana mules, he drove and left the
mining man in the mountains to find his
way to the border as best he could. He
wandered about fourteen days and each
night found him In almost the same place
where he had camped tne night before.
He finally found his way to San Pedro
after subsisting all this time upon toads,
lizards and cactus, j He said that he drank
water from holes which were strewn
about with the putrid carcasses of ca.ttle.
The struggle on the desert and long ex
posure weakened his mind and when he
reached San Pedro he could tell little of
what had occurred. He. went on to. Bis
bee and from there Came to Tucson.
George said that he was on his way to
San Francisco, where a railroad man was
Interested with him in rich gold mine;
he was working In Sonora. He could not
remember the name of his partner to
day but the physician who attended him
believes that his mind will be clear in a
few days and he will be able to give a
full account of himself and his operations.
He said that news reached him at Blsbee
that Murphy had been captured by Mexi
can authorities and shot. He was anxious
to communicate with his partner, but his
Inability to give the latter s name renders
the authorities here unable to do anything
but care for him until he recovers.
George Is 69 years of ag-er vigorous and
apparently a man of ability.
TUCSON, Ariz.. Sept.. 27.â Hiram George,
a mining, man fi-om Sonora, arrived in

and robbery. He left his mining camp at
Bacuacha, Mexico, as soon as news of the
Galveston disaster reached him, his wife
and seven children having been lost In it.
iWith him was "Jim" Murphy, his cook,
and Mr. George took also J10.000 of Mexi

MERCED, Sept. 27.â The officers are
hard at work endeavoring to locate the
robbers who forced Treasurer Bambauer
to open the county vault and, after they
had emptied the trays of coin Into a sack,
locked him In the vault and made off -with
their plunder. The officers and detectives
believe that the thieves were amateurs or
the y would have made an attempt to blow
open the treasury chest, as It contained
over $70,000. A3 the Courthouse la situated
a long distance from any house the chest
could easily have been wrecked without
attractlrg any attention. It is te ieved that
they were local men, as one of them -wore

The men arrested in Fresno yesterday
were released, as they did not tally Â¦with

man was also brought In by an officer
from Livingston, but, he too was released.

common Japanese paper napkin. It read

TELLS OP A SEA DISASTER.
THE glossy, green-tiled front of
the Techau Tavern still smiles a
welcome to the passerby on Ma
eon street, but behind the emlle
there is only hollow mockery, for
there Is no longer entertainment there for
man. The interior of the hospitable hos
telry was ravaged yesterday morning by
fire, smoke and water, and mine host Te
chau thinks that his loss will be fully 530,
000.
At a quarter of 9 o'clock In the morning
a passerby saw smoke arising from the
roof and he at once gave the alarm.
When the Fire Department arrived on
the scene the south half of the roof and
the south wall were afire and pouring out
Rreat clouds of smoke. Knowing the
flimsy character of the buildings adjoin
ing, Fire Chief Sullivan turned in a sec
ond alarm and played six strong streams
upon the burning building. He literally
deluged the place and the water came
running down the stairways in great cas
cades. At the end of an hour the fire was
extinguished, leaving the pretty front of
the building unmarred. One looking at
the house from the street could hardly
believe that there had been a nre at all.
The lace curtains in the windows were
intact, and the only evidence of disaster
that could be seen from the street was
broken plastering on the south end.
The big fire was the result of flames in
the flues leading from the charcoal broil
ers on the southeast corner of the lower
floor, catching the grease and running up
between the walls to the roof. Mr. Te
chau was getting out of bed just before
the alarm was given and was giving an
order to a servant for his breakfast, when
he heard a roaring, rumbling noise. Hei
asked what it was, and the servant opened*"
the door to ascertain, when smoke came '
through the door and from under the car
pets. Mr. Techau lost no time in dress
ing and was almost overcome by the
smoke- before he succeeded in making his
escape.
The building was insured for $40,000 in
the following named companies: Thu
ringia. $20.00-); New Zealand, $10,000; Lon
don and Lancashire. $7500, and Fireman's
Fund. $2500. The agent of another com
pany had Just called with a policy for $10,
000, to begin October 1, when the fire
broke out. The agent kept the policy in
his pocket, and watched the nre^ from a
safe distance.
The Tavern was completed sixteen
months ago on the site of Dr. Gibson's
United Presbyterian Church. The front
of the church was torn down and the side
walls were left, a handsome new front of
dark-green glazed tiles being put up.

Owing to Mrs. Stanford's absence in
r.urope she could not be seen, hut it is
well known that she has grave fears for
the university's future welfare. It Is said
upon good authority that her heirs in the
East have sent to California for copies
of our State cedes that they might search
out for themselves the legal flaws in the
university grant.
At to-day's student body meeting the
whole question was so thoroughly dis
cussed that every member of the coKeg;
realizes its full importance. Every one
is ready to work for the confirmation ol
the grant by urging the passage of the
proposal amendment. George E. Crothers
was re-elected president of the club;
Charles L. Lewers. vice president, and
J. F. SheÂ«Â»han, 'secretary and treasurer.
The following were named executive com
mitt^men: F. V. Ke^silnp. C. B. Whit
; tier. J. R. Hamilton. W. M. Erb. C. K.

versity's real property would not be ex
empted frcm local taxation at all and
only the campus and Iniildinps would be
freed from State taxation. Its personal
property, though, would be exempt. ThU
failure to follow this act up with neces
sary legislation relating to Stanford Uni
versity in particular may prove to be a
disastrous mistake. Â»
Since the university is not a public cor
poration doubt is also expressed whether
or not it can legally grant degrees undei
the State constitution. A bill to remedy
this defect was drafted several years ago
by the head of the law department, but
has never been introduced into the Legis
lature.
Further objections to the present law
as it stands upon the statute books arc
urged. First, it does not allow the uni
versity to receive property by will, nor to
hold property outside of the State. This
shuts off a gift from Thomas Welton
Stanford of Australia, r.-ho has already
made a will in favor of the university for
the bulk cf his property, valued at about
SS.000.400.
Under the proposed amendment the uni-
Further facts than those disclosed by
the president have come to light this af
ternoon. Mrs. Stanford has changed the
number of trustees, origina..- 1 - twenty
four, from time to time until now there
are but iiftecn. Further than that, their
term has been reduced from life to ten
years. It will also be noticed that the
Krant was only to found a university.

Great excitement has been caused at Leland Stanford Jr. Univer-
Eity by admissions made yesterday by President David Starr Jordan at
a mass-meeting called to consider plans for the campaign on behalf
cf the proposed amendment to the constitution remedying the xlef sets in
the founding 1 and endowment gTant and exempting university property
from taxation- It was shown that under an amendment to what may
have been an invalid statute, Mrs. Stanford had given to the university
Â£20,000,000, and that title to all of her gifts was open to attack. So
earnest was the warning of the president that the future of this
great institution of learning depended upon the success of the proposed
amendment that his words left a profound impression and have caused
widespread alarm.

this afternoon and after effecting tem

7:30 o'clock this evening. For a short time
afyer reconvening It was one of the live
liest conventions that has been held in tds
city in many years. The trouble came
from the Second Supervisorial District,
the nomination for Supervisor being
sought for by William McLaughlln. the
Incumbent, and William Kent, a brother
of City Trustee R. E. Kent. There was a
contest over the selection of delegates In
the Second district, and after consider
able work on the part of the McLaughlJn
men the delegates irora the other four
districts agreed that they would vote to
take the nominating of Supervisors out of
the districts and have it done by the con
vention at large. They kept their word,
and the convention decided to select not
only the Supervisors In that manner, but
the Assemblymen and fifteen county cora
mltteemen as well.
Attorney Arthur M. Seymour of this city
In speaking to the report of the commit
tee on organization and order of business,
providing for the selection of candidates
by the convention at large, made the
statement that McLauphtin had been In
formed by adherents of his opponent that
he could have the nomination for a mone
tary consideration. Seymour said that he
realized the responsibility he assumed In
making the statement and that he. was
prepared to prove It.
The convention then proceeded to select
Its nominees, with the following results:

SEATTLE, Sept. 27.â The destruction of |

of September 12, was completed by the j
storm reported by the Roanofce as having
been encountered on September 15, ar.d j

more severe than its terrible predecessor. |
This was the third storm that had swept ;

The passengers and officers of the Ta- ;
coma, which arrived here to-day, report j
that the transaction of business on First
avenue had been practically suspended.
The buildings remaining were belntj held
In place by cables to upland posts. Two
or three saloons were afloat and. being
moored to secure fastenings, were filled
with crowds drinking to drown the dreari
ness oj their surroundings.
Tht? strength of the wind was so gTeat
that the tide was driven to the greatest
height ever known. River street was
completely covered, more than half the
stores on Its lower side being: carried off
their foundations and many others great
ly damaged. The water arose so rapidly
that the-merchants had little time to save
stocks, and in many cases they were able
to carry away nothing, having barely
time to escape with their own lives.
It is estimated that more than 5000 tons
of coal were buried by the eand or carried
out by the water. The losses are so heavy
that a scarcitv of coal for winter use is
certain. Previous to the storm coal was
selling at $45 a ton, but at last reports It
had reached $125.
The lumber yards also suffered h*av
lly. More than 500,000 feet of lumber,
mostly dressed, was washed out to sea.

THEORIES ABOUT FOOD.
A little booklet on cause and cure of
stomach troubles mailed free by address-
ing F. A. Stuart Co.. Marshall. Mich.
That large class of people who conr*
under the head of nervous dyspeptics
should eat plenty of meat and Insure its
proper digestion by the daily use of a safe
harmless digestive medicine like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, composed of the nat-
ural digestive principlesâ pepsfn. diastase,
fruit acids and salts, which actually per-
form the -work of digestion. Cheap cathar-
tic medicines, masquerading under the
name of dyspepsia cures, are useless for
indigestion, as they have absolutely no
effect upon the actual digestion of food.
Dvspepsia In all its many forms is sim-
ply a failure of the stomach to digest food,
and the sensible way to solve the riddle
and cure the dyspepsia is to make daily
use at meal time of a preparation like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which Is in-
dorsed by the medical profession and
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples.
All druggists â¢ sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at Â£0c for full treatment.
Dr. Julius Remmson on this subject
eays: "Nervous persons. pÂ«ople run down
in health and of low vitality should eat
meat and plenty of it- If the digestion is
too feeble at first It may be easily correct-
ed by the regular use of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets after each meal. Two of these
excellent tablets taken after dinner will
digest several thousand grains of meat.
eggs or other animal food In three hours.
and no matter how weak the stomach
may be no trouble will bÂ« experienced If
a regular practice is made of using Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, because they
supply the pepsin and diastase necessary
to perfect dlsrestion. and every form of In-
digestion Â¦will be overcome by their use.
As compared with grains and vef etable*.
meat furnishes the most nutriment in a
highly concentratÂ«d form and Is digested
and is assimilated more quickly t hftrl veg-
etables and grains.
A healthy appetite and common sease
are excellent guides to follow In matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats is undoubtedly the best.
Oar forefathers had other thing? to do
than formulate theories about ths food
they ate. A warm welcome was extended
to any kind, from bacon to acorns.

Inspector Tupper were directed to en
deavor to prevail upon the company to
install the lights. In case of refusal its
demands for public lighting may be hela
up, according to the committee's opinion.
The resolution directing the auditor and
Treasurer to audit and pay the telephone
bills was rescinded and a new resolution
Â¦was recommended simply, approving 1 the
demands. If the'Auditor follows the char
ter he will refuse to audit them on the
ground that the telephone company is in

The fourth heat opened with Creseeus
the. favorite once more. At the word
Creseeus, Charley Herr and Arlon went
by on even terms. Out went the first
named, pulling Herr after him, and tho
latter having a trille the better of It at
the quarter mile, while Grattan Boy had
displaced Arion aii third.- Charley Herr
continued to lead by half a length: CreÂ»
ceus could not shake Grattan Boy, while
Arlon was four lengths behind. It was
at the three-quarters that Herr's chance
of winning looked best, for with the
whole length to the good it did not ap
pear that he could lose. But with an ease
that carried the crowd off its feet 'Cres
eeus stepped out and In the stretch went
to the front by four lengths and Herr
tired, was whipped under the wire a sec
ond. Just out of Grattan Boy's way. The
others were well behind.
On the resumption of scoring the word
was given to a ragged start, as Grattan
Boy and Ix>rd Vincent held back, while
Crpsceus and Charley Herr had their
noses to the front. Grattan Boy, as the
favorite for second place, started a trifle
unsteady, then settled down, but not quick
enough to keep Arlon from takinK the pole
at the eighth, with Charley Herr at his
heels. Jupe was last and the others well
bunched. Around the llrst turn went the
horses and until the quarter it was not
possible to pick position. At that distance
Arion had an easy lead, Herr right behind
Grattan Boy. Creseeus and Benton M
making a fast bunch. At the half the
horses were about the same, all moving
steadily. On the next quarter the sroinp
was very fast, and at the three-quarters
Arlon barely led Charley Herr. All eyes
were on Creseeus, who seemed to be mak-
Ins Grattan Boy step out. and for an
elphth the speed was so srreat tBat both
horses almost^ciosed up the gap with the
leaders. Down the stretch they came, but
Charley Herr had gone by Arion-and by a
length was under the wire first. The light
was for placs. for Cresceus, breaking
away from Grattan Boy, tried to put his
nose ahead of Arion, but did not succeed.
The second heat was somewhat similar
to tho first, for it brought Charley Herr
again a winner. With the pole he imme
diately stepped lo the lead, The third
heat Charley Herr lost by, a nose. He
had the pole, but Creseeus got the best
of the start and Benton M the worst of
it, for the latter, never made up the dis
tance lost at the wire. Creseeus held the
lead to the eighth, was lighting hard to
keep Charley Herr behind him at tho
quartet, with Grattan Boy also to be
reckoned with, and lost the lead at the
half to Herr.
The day was perfect lor the race, and
the traek. while looking a little soft, was
evidently prlmo footinpr. The crowd must
have Rom* well over the 25.0()0 mark, the
people swarming over the grand staml at
$2 a seat and (ijling the bleachers at *1 n
head. The. grounds everywhere around
the stand* wen 1 "standing room only" for
thousands. The horses announced to start

BOSTON. Sept. 27.â Cr^sceus. tho kii\g
of stallions, added a jewel to his crown 10
day by winning in five hard-driven heats
the $20,000 race at the meeting, of the New
England Trottjr;fj Horse breeders' Asso
ciation on the Readsviilc track. So much
of the favorite was the son of Robert Mt-
Gresor before the trial began that the
pools were barred against him. It looked
for two heats iia if the great stake would
be wrested from the king by that wonder
ful little trotter Charley Herr. the winner
r.f the Massachusetts stake race *last
year. Cut game as was Charley Herr his
strength was not equal to the task, and
h!a star set in tho third heat, when Crcs
eeus beat him at tho w!r(\ Oncr> after
that. In the fourth heat, the Uexinpton
horse made a wonderful bid for the race,
leading to the threr-<|uarter.<j and then bo
ing beaten out In the strrtch by Crescpus,
who seemed to have marvelous speed just
when it meant so much to him.

For the whites McCreery made a clever
poal in the fourth period and soon after
Bettner followed suit, making a score of
two to the reds' four. The teams were
short on account of the absence cf the
Tobins.
To-day the programme will not start un
til half-past 1. It will be opened by an
exhibition of riding by Miss Marvin, who
will ride Carolan's Sporting Princess as
well as her own horsea. She rides with
out a saddle. The twenty-five-mile relay
will also be run, and the vaquero riding,
postponed from yesterday, will be on the
programme. To-mcrrow a special train
will be run at 10 o'clock to accommodate
the athletes.
The races this afternoon will be of ex
ceptional Interest.
Following is the result of the judging
of the horses yesterday:
The polo game furnished all the excite
ment of the day. There- were thj? "reds"
and the "whites," the reds being com
posed of T. A. Drlseoll, Charles Dunphy
and Peter Martin, the whites of John
Lawson, Walter McCreery and Robert
Ikltnc-r. From the time the ball was in
play there was no doubt of the result.
The reds were ahead on team work and
individual skill, although in skill they had
hard men to go against In Bettner and
McCreery. Dnscoli carried off the hon
ors of the pame. He made three of the
four goals of his side, and there was not
a play that did not ilnd him next to the
bail. Three times during the game he
n>ove the ball from the red goal down to
the whites' end of the field by his own
Brit and horsemanship and in the face of
all Interference. For part of the third
period he rode his new polo pony. Bob
Acres, the tleetest and liveliest polo mount
that has appeared on the polo field. Peter
Martin made the other^goal for the reds,
taking it cleverly from Driseoll's drive
out of a bunch.
tle and dogs, and with as lively a
polo grame # as Tanforan has- seen to end
th<? programme.
Tne principal interest was Fhown in the
horses, which were judged on the track
in front of the grand stand.* There were
two classes that caused more than, usual
interests-class 71 for roadsters and ap
pointments and class 118 for hunters. In
the roadster class there were two en
triesâCharlie Newman's team of straw
terry roans and R. E. Mulcahy's team of
hays. Newman easily got the prize for
his beauties, and soon after he had se
cured It he had three offers for his team,
two for thirty-seven hundred and another
that went that figure fifty dollars better.
Walter Hobarf was one of the bidders.
Newman figured the team was as valu
able to him as to any one else, so he kept
them.
â¢ In the hunter class there were four en
triosâ ttoree of Carol an'B and Peter Mar
tin's Monte Carlo. Searboro, one of the
Carolan entries, with Walter Hobart up,
toon. the hurdlts in good shape, but the
other two Carolan horses balked badly.
Martin's Monte Carlo, with Jerry Keat
lnpr, master of the San Mateo Hunt C!ub,
up, took the hurdles like a bird, neither
hesitating nor shying, but when it came
to the distribution of the ribbons he was
not in it. The Carolan horses got all
three and Monte Carlo had to content
himself with all the applause from the
trrunri stand.

Hardly any movement of this marvelous century
has had a more wonderful history than that which has
brought about the upbuilding of the Young Men's
Christian Association in all parts of the world. Fifty
six years ago the first association of the kind was
organized in London by a young man who was at that
time engaged as a clerk in a merchant's office.
From that small beginning the association has ex
panded to every part of the globe and has augmented
in power until it is now recognized as one of the most
REPORTS given of the second annual banquet
last evening of the boards of management of
the Young Men's Christian Associations of this
city and of Oakland will have the effect of calling the
attention of the general public to the flourishing con
dition of the two institutions and to the high order o l
the work they are doing. By means of that the banquet
will be profitable to the community as well as pleas
ant to those who attended it, for it can hardly be
doubted that much in the way of profit will be de
rived from the reawakened interest in the associa
tions.
THE Y. M. C. A. BANQUET.
An interesting legal battle is likely to
grow out of an incident that recently took
place on a Santa Fe passenger train. A
young man, 21 years of age, says the St.
Joseph News, presented the return cou
pon of a child's half-r:ite ticket for trans
portation from San Francisco to Kansas
City. He had bought the ticket eleven
years ago, it was unlimited as to time,
and he claimed the right to use the ticket
on his return trip. TUo railroad officials
on the other hand, argued that as it was
a half-rate ticket, good for a child under
12 years, of age, he, a man of 21. could
not ride on it. The contract on the back
of the ticket did not specify that tne child
was to stop growing, however, and now
the question is. Can tlie young man com
pel the railroad to carry him on that
ticket?â Kansas City Journal.

CALIFORNIANU IN WASHINGTON
x Such is a specimen story of the way in which the
law of the United States is used for fraudulent pur
poses. The extortion of the Canadian authorities in
the Klondike country is bad, but has never reached
such monstrous proportions as the wholesale looting
that is apparently going on at Nome. The miners on
that desolate coast are too far away from the national
capital to make their complaints heard there, but
persons in California are not too far away to be
heard, and they should sec to it that the facts are
brought to the attention of members of Congress in
order that a basis may be laid for impeaching the
Judge who has used his court Tor the purpose of pro
moting what has every appearance of being deliber
ate robbery.
The writer goes on to tell how two partners had
procured four claims in one of the richer districts, and
adds: "Before the papers were made out the claims were
placed in the hands of a receiver, the rightful owner
dispossessed; the receiver takes charge in collusion
with the jumper, buys expensive machinery that some
one could not use on the beach at an advantage, hires
forty or fifty men,. and commences to loot the claim
at an expense of $6oo or $700 a day. Mind you, no
work had ever been done on the claim until the grafc
crs had taken possession of it. Such a situation as
exists here would never have been tolerated one day
in any other mining camp that I have been in. I have
about given up trying to buy anything here this sea
son, believing fully that I woufel be robbed of my
property should I be so unfortunate as to sluice out
a dollar or two."
One of the leading business men in the city has re
ceived a letter from a reliable correspondent at Nome,
in which the writer says: "Things here are in very
bad shape owing to litigation. The grafters from the
East have formed a combination to steal every good
mine in this section of the country and have in their
possession all of them that are rich and are being
operated. Just as soon as a poor devil opens, up a
mine and gets to taking out money a jumper turns
up and the master goes into court; the court appoints
a receiverâ one of the push, of course â and the claim
falls into the hands of the combination, and the re
sult is like a snowball falling into h ."
ONLY a short time ago The Call had occasion
to publish a report of the manner in which the
Federal court at Nome has been used to en
able a clique of unscrupulous men to get possession
as "receivers" of a considerable proportion of the best
mining claims in the district. The reports were based
upon reliable information, and have, been amply con
firmed by statements from other sources. It is there
fore clear that an evil of great magnitude exists in the
administration of the law at Nome and that the whole.
Pacific Coast should exert its influence at Washington
to have the evils abated and the wrong redressed.

The five Filipinos who have reached Berkeley will
of course be welcomed with the hospitality to which
strangers in our land rre entitled, but there will be no
trreat eagerness among the taxpayers of California to
fee realized the expectation that the five are to be the
"forerunners of a lartre company."
In conclusion we repeat what we said before: "We
have in our n:idst about seven millions and a half of
illiterate negroes, our former slaves and their
descendants, and as many more illiterate whites of our
o.vn race. These are the lees in the wine of our civil
ization, and there be philosophers who say that we
ha\e no need to capture islands Â«even thousand miles
away to educate at our expense while there is such a
goodly number of our own people who don't know
I' from a bulUfoot."
If the United States :'s to undertake educating Fili
pinos it csn best perform the task by treating them
with justice in thri: home?/ and proving in the islands
themselves the difference between the civilization of
Spain and that of the United States. If our rule in
the Elands is to be so much like that of the Spanish
that it will be necessary to send students'to Berkelev
i". order to teach them that a difference exists, we
might as well abandon the educational project alto
gether.
California iÂ« a rich commonwealth, and her people
:;re noted for liberality. Nevertheless as the State is
as yet undeveloped there is a home demand for every
dollar the taxpayers can spare from their earning?.
Berkeley does not as yet possess a plant equal to its
needs. It lias more ?tuder.ts than it can .veil provide
for i:i the classrooms and the laboratories of any of
its departments. Under such circumstances it is
surely unwise for the Philippine Commissioners to
start toward Berkeley a stream of Filipino student-,
whether they require assistance from the public funds
or not.
Five Filipino boys, the first of the number who arc
to be sent here in accord with the policy of Professor
Moses, have arrived ;:t Berkeley. It is not yet made
known whether they arc among the lot who are to be
r.Â»Mste<l out of the public funds, but it has been an
nounced that they are expected to be "the forerunners
of a large company." and it is a safe conclusion that
i-oontr or later we shall be asked for the grant of
money for educating some of them.
Th< protest of The Call was based upon two
grounds â nri-t. that we can hardly placate an angry
and subjugated people by educating a few students:
second, that we have at home about as many boys and
girls to educate as the taxpayers of the State can well
afford to provide education for, and in addition
thereto have amon<j tht negroes and the whites of the
Southern States many millions of illiterates who r.eed
all the help the nation can give.
Wf HEN the firs-t publication was given to the rc
port of Professor Moses of the Philippine
Commission suggesting the advisability of
tending young Filipinos to California to be educated
The Call protested. In his report Professor Moses
"i-Yoni observations already inade I am in
clined to think that we shall find among the young
people of the islands a large number of eager an.l
competent students, tr.d I hope some arrangement
may be r.iade by which from time to time a goodly
number may be sent to the schools of America. It
r.i;ty perhaps be advi -able to render some of them as
tbtance from the public funds."

PERSONAL MENTION.
IN AUGUST, 1896.
FOUR years ago millions of dollars in
American Bold were being shipped abroad.
The reserve fund was running- low. Not
long before the Government had borrowed
$100,000,000 by Issuing 4 per cent bonds.
Money lenders had no funds to accommo
date Industry. Gold coin had all but dis
appeared. It was said that Russia had in
her treasury $.200,000,000 In American eagles.
IN AUGUST, 1900.
HENRY Labouchere Is credited with hav
ing said that there was no good reason why
the United States should not do the bank
ing for all the world. England has just
borrowed Â£5,000,000, or $25,000,000. of its
war loan in the I'nlted States. The Rus
sian finance minister. r>e Wltte. has de
cided to borrow JloO.OCO.OQO from American
financiers, and Japan is contemplating a
loan.
This is not the first time that public attention has
been attracted to the fraudulent practices of Mar
shals and constables in making arrests solely for the
purpose of getting fees. Nor are they the only offi
cials to be blamed, for in many cases Justices of the
Peace have co-operated with them. Such practices
were bad enough when tramps were the victims of the
arrests and the profit was made out of the pockets of
taxpayers, but when the evil goes so far that respec
table workingmen are halted on the highway and vir
tually robbed by the officers .of the law, it is high time
for some drastic measure of reform to be instituted.
The climate of California is attractive to tramps
and the State has always been infested by them.
Consequently the law gave a large authority to con
stables to arrest tramps, and public opinion generally
sustained the arrests. As a result the constables and
Justices soon found there was money to be made out
of the tramp industry, and. as has been said, in some
counties the officers actually encouraged tramps by
giving them a share of the profits made out of the
fees for arresting th?m. The later development of
stopping honest men â¢ on the road and compelling
them to surrender their money to avoid arrest and
detention carries the evil to the degree of flagrant
crime, and where evidence of such extonions can b*
obtained the guilty officers should be subjected to
the fullest penalty of the law.
The Reno man, who signs his name R. Livingstone
and who appears to have had a good deal of expe
rience in such matters, declares in his letter that every
Marshal or constable in the interior counties compels
workingmen who are found traveling on foot to give
up money. He, states that on one occasion he un
dertook to walk froiri Los Angeles to this city and
on the way had to give up $12 75 to Marshals. The
Marshal at Bakersfield offered. to. give. him $2 to be
arrested. He took the money and was sentenced to
sixty days. The jailer' let- him out the same evening,
telling him they had no money for his grub. He was
arrested again at Provo and taken back to Bakers
field, where he was sentenced to thirty days. The
Marshal got his mileage, the Judge his fee and Liv
ingstone got thirty-six hours, as the jailer would not
keep him longer. "Every Marshal," wrote Living-
Stone, '"is good for from $1 to $5 and whisky is
thrown in as a. further inducement to be arrested, so
the officer can get the mileage and the Judges their
fees. It is the only State in the Union where labor
ing men who are forced to walk from place to place
are made the tools of Marshals and constables. 1
could give you the names of a hundred laboring men
who will corroborate my charges."
I â ; OLLOWING the report, in the press of. the
I manner in which a workingman while on his
way to Vallejo on foot had been virtually held
t'P by a constable at Port Costa and compelled tc
surrender his watch and- money comes a statement
from a man in Reno who asserts that he also had
been subjected to a similar extortion by the Port
Costa officer.

Was ever a public man more thoroughly discredited
by events, and was pretended foresight ever more re
buked by the facts?
Just contrast these changed and improved condi
tions with his general and sweeping declaration made
at Minneapolis in 1896: "The gold standard means
dearer money; dearer money means cheaper prop
erty; cheaper property means harder times; harder
times means more people out of work; more people
out of work means more people destitute; more peo
ple destitute means more people desperate, and more
people d/spcrate means more crime."
In 1896 the deposits in the savings banks of this
country were $1,907,156,277. In 1899 they were
$2,230,366,954, an increase of $323,000,000.
In 1896 he said: "There can be no general prosperity
in this country until we stop the conspiracy of those
who would make gold the only standard of the
world."
In his speech of acceptance in Madison-square Gar
den in 1896 he said: 'â¢Those who hold as permanent
investment the stock of railroads and other enterprises
are injured by the gold standard. The rising dollar
destroys the earning power of these enterprises with
out reducing their liabilities, and as dividends cannot
be paid until salaries and fixed charges have been sat
isfied, the stockholders must bear the burden. Rail
road rates have not been reduced to keep pace with
falling prices." ,
But the reports of the New York Produce Ex
change show that between 1873 and 1899 freight rates
fell 60 per cent, and Poor's Manual shows that the
dividends paid on railroad stocks in the United States
in 1806 were $81,528,154. while in 1898 they were
$94.Q37o-6; this was on the business of 1897 an in
crease of $13,000,000 over the year in which Bryan
uttered his frediction.
In 1896 the highest price of wheat in New York
was 68 cents a bushel; in 1900 it was Q2]/ 2 cents. In
like manner corn was 30 cents, now 47 cents; oats 2J
cents, now 28 cents; lard was 2>Vi cents, now 6.9 cents;
beef was $9 a barrel, now $12; Ohio XX wool was
17 cents, now 30^ cents; and silver, then 69 cents
an ounce, riovv 60 cents, about.
So the campaign takes the alignment of 1S96. The
sound money Democrats are again under arms. They
have organized a separate activity, have their advo
cates on the stump and are making again the same
effective fight they made four years ago. They sus
tain the gold standard law. declare it the indispensable
foundation of the public credit and of all the financial
reforms that are necessary to make a system that shall
be the proper instrumentality of all the people in their
business affairs.. Some favor and some oppose hold
ing the Philippines, but they hold that external is
sue in abeyance and refuse to permit it to be usel
as the means of instituting a domestic policy that will
again destroy our industries, check the rising tide of
prosperity, ruin business men and leave labor without
work or wages.
This swing to the issues of 1896 brings out Bryan's
prophecies of that year. He said repeatedly: "If
we have the gold standard prices are as certain
to fall as the stone that is thrown into the air. So
long as the scramble for gold continues prices muse
fall, and a general fall is prices is but another defini
tion for hard times."
The German Telegraph, organ of the German
population of Indiana, published at Indianapolrs,
which supported Bryan in 1896, denounced his sup
port of Populism as "an incredible folly." and declared
that "the lack of confidence and the apprehension
which will now be more strongly awakened 1 among
conservative voters will not be allayed until election
day." Even the New York World, which had been
giving Bryan a sort of perfunctory support, further
diluted it by denouncing the patent follies of his letter
of acceptance and exposing the risk and danger of his
financial policy. As far as the metropolitan press is
concerned the only "whole hog" support he gets is
from Hearst's three papers, and that is being broken
by republishing Hearst's "Nail the flag to the Philip
pines'" rant and his declaration that Democrats to
promote Democratic policies were compelled to vote
the Republican ticket.
THE campaign is swinging around again to the
money question. Colonel Bryan's unlimited
capacity for over-statement has seemed to de
stroy the force of the "paramount issue." Not con
tent to give the economic reasons against perma
nently holding the Philippines, he proceeded to paint
a lurid picture of imperialism, with an army of con
scripts. a vast military establishment riding and gall
ing the backs of the people, and a score of foolish and
fanciful things which were so overdrawn as to send
his hearers to examine the constitution and the struc
ture of their Government. There they found that the
purse and the sword are controlled by Congress, and
that a new House of Representatives is elected every
two years, coming directly from the people, and that
under the system of checks provided by the constitu
tion the House, in which all revenue bills must origi*
nate. has an absolute and unbreakable control of the
military and civil policy of the Government. They
found it is provided that appropriations for support
of the army can be for two years only, and that the
President and the Sciate are powerless as against the
popular branch of Congress. After this examination
they listened with less interest to Colonel Bryan's
frantic statement of the danger of imperial subversion
of their liberties and settled back upon the real issues
of the campaign, which they found to be exactly
those of 1806, except for aggravating additions made
by Colonel Bryan's indorsement of the Populist plat
form and acceptance of that party's nomination. Im
mediately the press which had been supporting began
to show defections. The Detroit Free Press, lead
ing Democratic paper of Michigan, abandoned him,
and in a stinging editorial rebuked the harm he had
done to anti-expansion, in which he believes, and
announced its opposition to his election and its in
tention to aid in his defeat.

PHILADELPHIA INQUIRERâ It is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that the

less resources and colossal wealth exhibit

building. Why can't It spend as much
for rebuilding Galveston or at least re
building the dwellings of the homeless?
ST. LOUIS GLOBE DEMOCRATâ In
his first inaugural address President Lin
coln said: "The power confided ln me will
be used to hold, occupy and possess the
property and places belonging to the Gov
ernment." Bryan takes the opposite view
of the duty of a President. He has pledget!
himself, if elected, to call an extra ses

territory of the United States.

we have laid strons smphasi* upon Uw

asd that !s deals with tt* subjec' matt*
wlth all the rigor app'.icab!e to any other
science in the realra of cioÂ«Â±enj fcsowiedir'!'.
Cut there is ore feature which furriianir-..
taL'y distinguishes the science of seogr*
phy frcm all the other of the sciences â at
least from all other cÂ£ the sreaxer sci
er.tres. It id wholly an applied science
The limitations which It3 rlnal parpc**
ptits upon it. namely, that it must con
cern i:Â«e2f only with what I* of Ictport
ar.e? to ma-Jciml. â Â¦..Â¦:- It altogether a
practical branch of huisas toowledse.
This accounts for thÂ» popularity which
Ssography has always enjoyed, even ir.
the day3 when its acier.tiSc character waÂ»
merely embryotlc. Now. when ita m?-:-i
oÂ«i3 and prccÂ«5de3 are wholly scie-t!ric.
it 13 more popular as a subject cf gBneral
?fidy than ever i: has been. If nowaday*
we read about a foreign people we wtsft
to be informed as to the causes of their
distin^uishir? ethnical character^:: -.
the causes of their distirg^ahisgcosaer
cia* characteristics, and s<> en. We are r. -y
longer satisfied with mere descr!ptior.Â».
We desire, as the phrase is. "to ks*"Â«r
tee why and the wherefore" of evÂ«ry
thta?. In other wortfs. our Interest in
things seosraphical is to-day always a
scientific ore.
Nor is this Interest an aiTalr cf iner^
idle desire of knowleds?. Man fcÂ«ine *
social beir? the cssefitxal f-rattire of hi*
activity is trade cr barter. He t3 forever
a creature that bays and setl3. The fnnda

The phrase used In out definition of g*osr

f r rr.fr." tÂ« essentially e<^uivaient to ~tn<Â»
earth as a field f 3r mart's cocuaercial ex
ploitation." Geography thus takes pri
mary cognizance of these feature* of l.te
earth and of those oro-Iucta of the earili
that are of commercial tasportanc*. It u
not a trivial nr iiile Lranch of hanaan
study. Its object is wholly deflnite .in-i
purposeful. And this definite purpose;-;!
object, when narrowed down to Us nios;
si?ni2cant feature. Is the explanation of
the physical phenomena of t"he earth'-*
surface with reference to their value or
Interest as factors in commerce.
Such is the s^ography- of the closta?

science. It (3 a practical science. And Irs
object is the tenef.t it car.kirtd through

ITost people would suppof? that when
the advaceemen: c' sÂ»o'5rar^5' is spoken
of the extension of our knowledge of
the earth"s surface would be the cost ixn- :
portar.t feature 0* this advancement. For '
example, the \7h0Ie of thÂ» territory now :
included, under the term "the United
States'" is tc-dav a well-defined, tolerably
well surveyed and altogether well-known
territory, â¢whereas a hundred years ag)
a. Iarjre portion of this territory w^a as lit
tle known as is to-day the interior of the
continent of Africa. And the continent o!
Africa, the scene daring the last ISO years
of so much adventurous exploration and :
discovery â so much, indeed, that scarcely
a single portion cf its area rennins un
known to whi:e menâ was at the b*gin
r.ing of the century now closing scarce;â :
known to the civilized world more than at â¢
its outermost edees.
It Is not, however. In this extension of
em knowledge of the details cf the earth a
surface that the advancement of geogra
phy most characteristic of our century t3
to be sought tor. That extension, won
derful as it is. is ortly in keeping with
similar extensions witnessed in every cen
tury of the world's history since Ootitm
| bus' time.
The advancecrent of geography most
> characteristic of the century has been its
i development from the mere "'lescrtFtior."
I which the race Implies to the d.gnjty of a
definitely understood and universally ree
ogrUsed "science."
The word "gwzraphy." acceriir.? to its
1 etymolo^v. siraply means "a description
: of the earth's surfice." and a hundred
i years ago no more was expected of srec?
' raphers than that they should be- able to
i furnish such a description. Tee more d<=
1 tailed this description was the more near
1 ly did it correspond to the idea generally
! entertained by people a* t? what was
i meant by soc^ruphy and as 10 what ?eos
'Â¦Â¦ raphers should bÂ«? able to do.
Curie? a hundred years a srrea; chancre
i has come about. The term "geography"
i no longer betokens an aimless narration.
I As said abovCk it has ctsme to mean a
' derinitp science, that science fceing the es
j act and orderly systemattzation "f our
! knowledge of the physical phenomena oÂ»
'Â¦the earth's surface and the explanation e.
; the action and interaction of these pbe-
I nomena and man.
In simpler words, {reosrraphy is now un
i derstood to b* the science which dÂ»al3
! with the worM (or earthK considered a~
' the abode and seme of action of human
1 society.
A3 has happened in the case of so many
! other branches of knowledge; the one
Â¦ great principle which !s now taken to be
J the all-embracins and <?3?ent:a! Â«Â»xplana
t tion of the infinitely varied and tnnnitely
i numerous items of knowledge that come
[ under the term geosraphy is that ai'-o
g-thor modern and characteristically nine
1 teenth century princtple of explanation
'Â¦ which we kr.ow of as "evolution.
With evolution, then, as its InxonsXBg
and explanaton- principle. ee-3?raphy DO1
merely ceases to be a series o. accor.a.s
' or narratives for the curious. anÂ«I he
' comes a me&ee, but it be:onÂ« a science
i in a peculiarly modern sense. _It <i^.3

NEW VOnx. Sept. 27.â To-day's noteworthy
alvan-es in prices of Mocks were primarily Jue
to the existence of a largre outstanding short
Interest. Manipulation against the fhorts was
bIfo vrry obvious and in the hands of strong
end resourceful Interest*. The bidding: up of
carrif-d prices Fwlftly away from the
t-eatr in the very crisis of their dlFtress and
Ihtn was a notable recalUng of stocks which
have hren loaned to the ehorts on advantaBÂ»
fus terms for a long time pa*t. This could
only be the r^ult of powerful manipulation
to force the Fhorts to buy Ft'>cks to cover. But
Â¦while these facts were obviously true, the up
var.i reaction oouH hardly have been precipi
tated or extended tt the lengths lt has with
out a strong revulsion of Fpeculatlve sentl
rrv-nt from the derrcsslon which has Induced
the liquidation for tome time past. Almost the
f-ntire credit for this revulsion must be. given
to the growing conviction, strengthened by
Ficnlficsnt admissions fmm authoratative I
tourrcs. that arrive nÂ«-gottations are eolnu for
â¢rard lirtween the anthracite coal operators and
the miners and that a baeis .of settlement has
b*en formulated with good hop* of success.
The violence of the recovery in prices on this
development is astonishing. considering the
email imjire.-'sion that has been made on the
pric* of coal-carrying railroads since the
ptnke has been In force and which ha* given
the lrrrireÂ«Ficn that there was little short Fell
ing bflnr done on account of the strike. This
furpoFitioc will scarcely hnld in view of the
larre beaj- account which wa* disclosed by the .
conviction that a ttrike settlement is Imminent.
But lt must be borne In mind that when prices
are once forcibly diverted i n a riven direction
In Wall Ftreet. eentlment on al! rwints Is made

mercurial minds of the !"i>eculators. In con- i
fomiity with this rule, to-day threw off all
thf.r lowering apprehenMcns of the coming
etrir.geri.-y cf the money market. The down
ward plunge of fterlirx exchange of a full half
cent in thÂ» pound for both actual and posted
rates heii^i to this result. The strength of
the. Mock market, growing into buoyancy, was
otr.t'.nuouE after an opening dip tn prices due
to the chagrin of the bears, who were driven
to cover last night on a rumor of the coal
Ftrtke Bettlemem which was net confirmed thia
morning. The extreme Advances in the coal

the leading fpecialtlef and local traction stocks

CHICAGO, Sept. 27.â October wheat opened
unchanged at 77*ic to 77Vic and soon after
touched 77'sc. the feeling being rather bearish
because of favorable weather In the North
west. A report that the French crop estimate
Is now t3,000,000 lees than a month ago stiffened
the views of holders and a reaction began.
This was helped along by a liberal falling
off in the aggregate receipt* at the big West
ern markets. These Uvo factors were the chief
influences In the advance of October to 77* 4 Qi
77 7 -Â»c. The bulge brought out profit-taking
wheat and the market declined to 77!ic where
it steadied on reports of good export sales an.i
the close was flrm, October Vic higher, at
77',2 l 57"Hc â¢
Business in the com pit was quite small not
withstanding the nervousness Indicated by lre
quent variations In price. October closed He
lower at 40c.
Oats were dull and featureless. October
closed a shade down at 2lTfcc.
Provisions were dull, but firm, sustained by_
a demand from local shorts and packers. Tha'
opening was easy because of liberal hog: re
ceipts. January pork closed 5c higher, lard
a shade up and ribs 2%t?5c Improved.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

PORTLAND, Sept. 27.â The wheat market Is
easier under the latest advance In freights, and
while limits have been reduced slightly the
selling movement has not been materially
checked. Walla Walla was selling to-day at
6CÂ®teVi;0 and bluestem about 59^c. There is
very little valley offering and prices are steady
at about 60c. The most Important event In the
wheat market to-day was the establishment of
the standard for the coming season. It has
been fixed at 59 pounds for Walla Walla and
5r>H for/ bluestem. This Is a pound higher to
the bushel than the standard established by
the Washington Grain Commission.

Ill* Broadway. S<>pt. 27.
A Coroner's Jury found to-night after an
! hour's deliberation that Policeman George
' MarRae was grossly careless when he
fire'j the ?hot that caused th*Â» death of
i Myron E. Brown. Th* verdict was agreed
i upon as a compromise to yatisfythe dlf
: fererit Ideas of the Jurors. Several Jurors
i favored a verdict of manslaughter aeainst
; the policeman, while one or two favored
j charging him with murder. After wrang
.' ling for some time some one juttgpst^d
th*t "gross carelessness" would apply,
and this being satisfactory to all the ver
'â¢ diet was thus written and signed, but not
i until three jurors had exprt-sÂ«ed a belief
that the testimony Indicated that Brown
! die,! frcm natural causes.
CJeorpe MacRae. the man who did the
i shooting, was Â» ot present at the inquest.
! but GuFtave Harst and Charles Jee>,
friends of the officer who were witnesses
; ef the ghooting. testified that they paw
: three shots fired. The first two were fired
I while MacRae held on to the side of the
I buggy. Charles Kolly and Max Jacobs,
I who were with Brown In the bucgy and
i were placed under arrest by ilaoRae,
. stated that after stopping the rig the po-
J lireman draeg^d Brown from the buggy,
' handcuffed him and th^n ortierpd him to
j climb back. While MacRae wn.Â« trying to
i climb into the bupgy the horse made a
1 sudden start. The officer hf-Id on to the
j side of the bUK*ry and drawing hi3 re
i rolver fired two shots. He then fell to the
j ground and while on his knecÂ« fired again
Dr. S. H. B'lteau testified that Brown
; died from traumatic pneumonia, due to a
j bullet wound in his right lung.
The vercict wiis as follows:

Mrs. Doheny's friends in Los Angeles
were notified of her death at once. Ad
vices as to the disposition of the body
have yet to be received. She was 37 years
of age and A native of New York.
Coroner Mehrmann toon charge of the
case, and the bottle of nuid. which is
labeled "â¢Poisnn" in black lettering on a
heavy red background.
"I wa? attracted a short time after
ward by a violent screaming. Rushing
to her room I found that Mrs. Doheny
was in terrible aÂ»ony. She had intended
to take seme of the meÂ«.icine. but got the
fluid by mistake, both bottles being very
similar In appearance and the color of
tne uuids being much the same."
Mrs. Doheny left the south and went to
San Francisco, later building the resi
dence at Linda Vista, where she died.
Miss M. Morgan, who had been Mrs.
Dobeny's companion since Â»ast November,
was in charge of the Some to-day. He*
explanation of the atiair is as follows:
"Mrs. Doheny has been a sufferer from
nervous troubles for a long time. Last
Monday I sent to the drug store for some
medicine and for the battery fluid which
she wanted for batteries in the hou3e
equipment. Mrs. Doheny took the pack
ages when they were delivered and went
up stairs to her room.
The Dohenys' home had been in Los An
geles for many years. Before that Do
heny resided in New Mexico, where he
had mining Interests. The couple were
married there eighteen years ago. Do
heny is a successful oil man in Southern
California and is recognized as one of the
leading experts of the oil industry in the
State. He has accumulated a fortune la
a very few years.
The fluid chemically is salammoniac.
Mrs. Doheny drank six ounces, it is esti
mated.
Dr. E. X. Ewer. Dr. R. T. Stratton and
Dr. W. S. Porter nttended Mrs. Doheny.
They found that deatn was rot Instanta
neous because the first effect of the con
siderable quantity she drank had been
that of an emetic.

pil magnate, died to-day at her residence.
622 Walsworth avenue, from the accident
al drinking Monday afternoon of some so
lution intended for an electric battery.
She mistook the solution lor medicine.
Almost as soon as Mrs. Doheny tasted the
fluid she realized h?r error and screamed
for assistance. Household attendants
called physicians, who prolonged her life
until to-day, but the patient had swal
lowed sufficient to produce fatal results.
The poisonous mixture contained consid
erable sulphuric acid ar.d other chemical
combinations' forming a draught most
deadly tn nature.

"With the patient perfectly conscious
though dead to pain the sTirgtcal staff of
the Receiving Hospital this afternoon
amputated both feÂ«t and trepanned the
skull of Miss Cora Friend, the woman
who was struck by the local train a?
Twenty-third avenue station yesterday
afternoon. The operation was the first
of its kind ever per'orinetl in Alameda
County and one of the f*w ever attempt
ed oa the Pacific Coast. Instead of fol
lowing the usual method of anesthesia oy
the use of chloroform cr ether the system
now in vcpue in the great hospitals of
Europe was used â that of dulling the
sensory nerves by the usÂ« of cocaine hy
podermically administered.
Dr. J. M. Shannon, who recently re
turned from an extended tour of Europe.
directed the administering of the drug,
which wan Injected directly into the pa
tient's spinal cord. The needle of the hy
podermic syrlnjre was inserted between
the vertebrae and the fluid sent Into the
body's greatest nerre.
Miss Friend was able to talk and *nve
directions to the surgeons for her com
fort. Not at any time did she l^se con
sciousness nor aid she make any outcry
while her feet were removed or her scalp
laid back and a piece of the skull re
moved. With eyes wide open the woman
lay motionless, making no complaint of
pain. She was prevented from watchinst
the work of the surgeons, and only
when she caught an occasional glance of
her mangled limbs did she speak of her
wounds hurting her.
After the operation Misa Friend rallied
and hopes are now entertained of her re
covery. Had chloroform or ether been
administered in her weakened state she
would probably have died from shock
during the operation.
The surgeons who performed ' the oper
ation are Dr. F. R. Porter. Dr. R. T.
Stratton. Dr. J. H. Milton. Dr. E. N
Ewer. Dr. Rowe. Dr. J. M. Shannon and
Dr. Reinhardt. All were outspoken In
their praise of the new system, and Miss
Friends case will bÂ« watched with a
great deal of interest.
In explanation of the effect of the co
caine the surgeons stated that the drus
had the effect r>f paralyzing the sensorv
nerves but leaving the motor centers
perfectly ncnr.al. The effect Is but tem
porary and loaves r.o had after effects.

Detectives Cody and Gibson testified aÂ«
to having received McGlade at the ferry
after his arrest. Former Chief of Police
Lees will testify this morning. The prose
cution will close to-day and the defense
open.
. Joseph Beler of the firm of Belr & Reg
ensberger was the first witness of the
day.' He testified that he was in his office
when Radomsky was paid the money on
the orders he alleged McGlade gave him
He knew nothing further about the case
J. B. Mclntyre. who bound the books
from which the slips were taken and filled
out as orders, identified his hajidtwork
and stated that such slips went to the
office of the Superintendent of Streets.
â¢ M. M. Regensberger was called to the
stand to testify as to the modus operandl
which preceded the payment of money by
his firm on warrants. Charles Trull Iden
tified one of McGlade's signatures which
was being used as an exemplar for pur
poses of comparison. Theodore Kytka
testified that in his opinion the signature"
on the orders on which the money was
paid to Radomsky were those of the de
fendant.
Radomsky was placed upon the stand
again yesterday afternoon. He adhered
to his second statement, testifying that
the order of October 14 was given to him
by fedward McGlade, a brother of the
accused. He said, however, that he knew
Peter McGlade received the money for
the same, as he told him that he would
get the money from a woman and pay it
back. Subsequently the witness "said the
defendant told him that the woman was
dead. He carried the money received on
the order of October 14, he said, to Ed
ward McGlade. who was waiting at Mat
O'Donnell's saloon. He believed Peter
McGlade received the money, because he
saw him go downstairs with Edward
Radomsky admitted that he was fresh
from an interview with the District At
torney, to whose office the Sheriff took
him. . -V. *
J. R. Radomsky, whose arrest on the
supposed charge of false swearing caused
a mild sensation in the Peter McGlade
trial, was released from custody yester
day by order of Judge Burnett. District
Attorney Bylngton and Judge Burnett
both reached the conclusion that Radom
sky did not deliberately change his state
ment with the object in' view of aiding
the defense, but that his second statement
was intended to correct the first, which

Benjamin Ide Wheeler was announced
as the next speaker. His theme was "The
Association Work a Factor in University
Life." President Wheeler paid a splendid
tribute to the work which' the Young
Men's Christian Association is doing in
the University of California. The associ
ation, he said, has inspires students to
workâ to worthy, uplifting, moral and in
tellectual work. It is teaching young men
the very essence of right living, which Is
work. "It Is teaching young men to do
the Master's work in the Master's spirit
and by such work they shall see the Mas
ter's light."
Major General Shatter was the next
speaker, and his theme was "Echoes from
the Association Work in the Army." Gen
eral Shafter gave unlimited praise to the
services rendered By the Young Men's
Christian Association In the -war with
Spain. In providing for the physical and
moral wants of thousands of soldiers the
association performed a service for which
the nation should be grateful. In closing
General Shafter said: "The fellows who
are not afraid to acknowledge their God
and who pray before they shoot are hard
men to handle. You may kill them, but
you can't whip them."
"The Association as a Worldwide
Brotherhood of Man" was the themo
chosen by R. H. Chamberlain of Oakland.
He reviewed briefly tne remarkable
growth of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation since Its organization sixty
years ago. It has spread, around the
world, it is In every c-lviilzed land, help

which they are doing for the young men

The Mayor Kent the following letter to
Judge Cabaniss:
Judfre C3eoree H. Cabaniss. City Hall. City-
Dear Judge: There Is a clash of authority in
the matter of the assignment of rooms, which
will no doubt be satisfactorily explained to
you by the Inclosed letter, which I have writ
ten to the departments of the city govern
ment. The Board of Supervisors will take ac
tion next Monday, and until, that time there is
no authority in any department to move Its
quarters. I regret you did not refer your dis
pute to me, as there must be an arbiter in
matters of this kind to avert friction between
the several departments and to preserve au
thority where it belongs. The authority for
asslKnment is in the Board of Supervisors,
which has not acted in the premises as yet.
You will please respect this order, by which
you wiil ?ee the propriety of occupying your
own or Judpp Mogan's room until other assign
ment is legallj and properly made. Yours
truly, JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
September 27, 1900.
The "inclosed letter" referred to by the
Mayor contains the following:
It la expected that next week the new Hall
Meantime the Chief had not been Idle.
The Mayor sent for him as soon as he
reached his office, but he happened to be
at the big tire, and word was sent to him
that the Mayor wanted to see him at
once. He called upon the Mayor, and
after stating his position the Mayor
agreed with him, but pointed out that
none of the courtrooms in the Hall of Jus
tice could be occupied till the Board of
Supervisors took action at their meeting
Monday by rescinding the ordinance des
ignating where the courts. City Prison
five defendants, two waiters and three
sailors charged with disturbing the peace,
were made to promise that they would go
with the Judge to the Hall of Justice and
not attempt to escape. They were re
leased on their own recognizance on that
promise and they left the courtroom with
the Judge and his clerk. They all board
ed a McAllister street car and the Judge
paid their fares. Arriving at the Hall of
Justice with the five defendants and hla
clerk, the Judge found several witnesses
waiting in other caseS that had been set
for trial there. Before opening court the
Judge had to write out the complaints,
and then he ascended the b^hch and soon
disposed of the cases.
TREMENDOUS ROW BETWEEN POLICE JUDGE CABANISS AND
CHIEF SULLIVAN REGARDING THE COURT'S REMOVAL IS AGI
TATING OFFICIALDOM AT THE HALL.
Chief Sullivan said he had no criticism
to make of Judge Cabaniss' actions. "The
Mayor has indorsed the position I took."
said the Chief, "and that is all I care for.
I have nothing but the kindliest feelings
for the Judge, who is honest, straight
forward and capable, but erratic. He will
get over that in time. It is nothing but
a flash in the pan. He wanted the prison
ers taken to the Hall of Justice and I de
clined, and that was all there was to It.
I had no reason to object to Judges Fritz
or Cabaniss holding court there, as there
wore no prisoners required to be trans
ferred fro mthe prison. I am of the opin
ion that the proceedings of these two
Judges there are illegal, but I may be
wrong. The thing is all over now as far
as I am concerned, nnd I don't care to say
anything more about It. We will not open
in the Hall of Justice till the middle of
next week, but on Sunday the California
street station will be closed and the of
ficers will report at the Hall of Justice, as
we don't want to Incur another month's
rent."
'â¢The Chief has been telling everybody
that everything would be transferred to
the Han of Justice by Sunday, so that we
could all hold court there Monday, and
we have all been continuing cases till
then, notifying the witnesses and attor
neys to be at the Hall of Justice on that
day. I shall write the Mayor and notify
him that I will hold court In Judge Mo
gan's courtroom to-morrow, but I will
point out to him that In the matter be
tween the Chief and myself there was no
occasion to call upon him or any one else
to be arbiter. The Chief has several pa
trol wagons and 550 men, and there could
not be much inconvenience in placing a
few prisoners in one of the wagons along
with two officers and taking them to the
Hall of Justice." Â¦.
"I will bow to the will of the Mayor, as
his authority is superior to mine and hla
note is a courteous one. But I still re
fuse to recognize the authority of the man
of fuss and feathers who declined to al
low my bailiffs to be in my court to-day.
Two bailiffs are assigned to my court by
the charter, and I consider they are un
der my direction and not his. I want him
to understand I am not responsible to
him for my actions, but if I do wrong as
a Judge there Ik a proper tribunal to try
me. He raised no objection to Judge
Fritz or myself holding court in the Hall
of Justice previous to yesterday, and It
shduld not have been necessary for the
Mayer to show him what he should have
known.
of Justice will be ready for occupancy. ThÂ«
Board of Supervisors, which is invested with
this authority, will assign rooms to the various
departments affected by the change, both In
the Hall of Justice and in the City Hall. By
resolution No. 877, passed at its meeting Sep
tember 24, the board directed Us building com
mittee to make assignments and submit its
report for confirmation, which will come- up be
fore the Koard of Supervisors for considera
tion on Monday next, October 1, and all ques
tions will at that time be decided.
The Judge, on receipt of the Mayor's
letter with inclosure, said:
After Consultation With Chief Sullivan His Honor Notifies
the Court That the Hall of Justice Cannot Be
Occupied Till Action Is Taken by the Supervisors.
THE clash of authority between
Chief Sulliv- and Judge Ca-
baniss, which had a threatening
aspect yesterday morning, has
been settled through the interven
tion of Mayor Phelan. and the Judsje, al
though bowing to the will of the Mayor,
still breathes defiance against the Chief.
True to his promise, the Judge held court
in the new Hall of Justice yesterday
morning, but his doinpr so was not â¢with
out its humorous features.
The Judge sat In his old courtroom to
dispose of the "drunks" assigned to him.
Bailiffs Carmichael and Fleming were in
attendance, and the Judge asked them if
they had received any orders not to ko
to the new courtroom. They replied in
the affirmative, and the Judge said he
would not place them in an invidious po
sition by insisting on his authority to
compel them to go with him. He had the
felony case of R. B. J. Giles, charged with
illegal registration, and six misdemeanor
cases on his morning calendar. The fel
ony case he transferred to Judge FritCs
court, one of the misdemanor defendants
was out on Â£C0 cash bail and the other
