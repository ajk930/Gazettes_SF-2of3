The Grand Lodge committees, I. O. O. F., were here to-day and organized local relief com
mittees to look after and care for the sick and destitute of that order, for whom an appeal has been
sent to the lodges of the Union for relief.
The keeper of the life saving station at the western extremity of the island got in to-day.
He reports the station gone and that a frightful scene of desolation exists there. He says that
I^o bodies were buried there; that the prairie and marshes are strewn with the carcasses of ani
mals and reptiles, and that the stench is terrible.
The injured and sick, under the thorough system established by the Board of Health and
local p-ivsicians. are receiving every care and attention and doing as well as. could be expected un
der the circumstances, which are being improved daily.
All the churches in the city being either wrecked or ruined, with one or two exceptions, di
vine services were suspended.
To-morrow a census of the Catholic population will begin to ascertain the number of wid
ows and orphans caused by the storm and the exact number of Catholics that perished.
Since all the railways terminating here have united upon one bridge and are pushing the
work night and clay with a large force reconstructing it, while the tracks are being restored on
the island and mainland by large forces, it is confidently asserted that Galveston will have com
munication directly by Wednesday next. If this is done it will relieve the existing situation won
derfully, as all supplies are now being brought in by boat.
The cleaning up and disinfecting of the streets, stores and buildings is being diligently
carried on. and the sanitary condition of the down-town portion of the city has been greatly im
proved. Mayor Jones stated to-day that there would be no abatement in the work until the en
tire city is cleaned and disinfected.
Dry goods stores and clothing houses resemble great laundries, every available space be
ing occupied with goods hung up to dry. Fortunately the weather is clear, hot and dry. for this
purpose.
The destitute wishing to go to friends in the country are given free transportation and are
being sent out of the city as rapidly as the limited transportation facilities at the disposal of the
committee on transportation will permit. The owner of any water craft or railway found guilty of
charging more than the regulation fee will be arrested and severely dealt with.
United States Marshal Grant has been given full authority by Adjutant General Curry, and
is directing affairs on the mainland, aided by troops of rangers, who are ordered to make short
work of looters and to arrest all suspicious characters. The rangers and militia and civil guards
stationed at Texas City and Virginia Point are under the direction of Marshal Grant. These are
the two points of ingress into the city. He also has control over all the railways running into the
city and all craft plying between Virginia Point and Texas City, and no one can embark or dis
embark at these places without his permission, unless having authority to do so from his superior
officers.
GALVESTON, Tex., Sept. 16. â This was a dreary Sabbath in Galveston. Services were
held in the few churches made fit for use since the great storm. All day men and boys
were at work clearing away the debris. Only a few dead were found during the. day and
they were quickly burned, no attempt being made to identify them. The military authorities and
the civil authorities are now co-operating harmoniously and consequently there is less looting and
desecration of corpses. Sheriff Thomas is in charge of the isolated district and is directing inter
ments and the recovery of property there.
The Santa. Fe system has concentrated
nearly ail Its best bridg-e and track men
on the spot, working to restore communi
cation with Galveston. The track was
completed to Virginia Point at 10:30 to-
State Health Officer Blunt left here to
day for Austin, where he will make a re
port to the Governor concerning condi
tions la Galveston. It is said that this
etatement will estimate the mortality at
Â£300 souls. Dr. Blunt was in Galveston
revwal days and made a thorough investi
ca.tion of the results of the storm.

that the water works are running,
some of the streets lighted, many
others nearly cleared of debris and
tolesraphlr communication with

pared to receive donations of money or supplies in any quantities, which
the society would forward as soon as possible and without expense to the River.

less, so that whatever goes out will be fit for use at onee when it arrives in
the stricken district. To-day Mrs. Dr. MacKenzIe and "Mrs. Arthur Cornwall

all appointed and to-day they will all get down to business. A plan, already pub
lished, has been decided upon by which the entire State will be covered so far
as the committee is concerned, and all who will give will be reached and hi*
subscription taken care of. Arrangements have been made with the express
and telegraph companies by which money and supplies can be shipped with the
least posible loss of time and the least expenditure of money, and with the
work systematized it will not take long to gather In all that can be gathered
from the people of. the State. - --Â«?-fi

The United Mine-workers ppent
Sunday in strengthening their
lines where they were weak.
Organizer James came up from
Hazelton and addressed a large meeting
at Hudson, five miles north of this city.
It was reported Saturday that the miners
cf that place intend going to work
Monday. Mr. James was sent for and a
meeting called.
In the course of his addrrsa Mr. James
was loudly applauded. There were many
women in the audience and they seemed
to be as enthusiastic as the men.
At Plains Organizer Nicholls addressed
a large meeting. He, too. aroused much
enthusiasm. He paid the prospect of
winning the strike was excellent and he
advised the miners to stand firm.
In one of the suburbs of this city a Tj1<
meeting of union and non-union men was
hold. The meeting resolved itself into a
union gathering and *a resolution was
adopted requesting all men to keep away
from the mines. Meetings were also hei<i
in many other places In the county and ah
w#Â»rÂ« largely attended.
The United Mine-workers feel confident
to-night that there will be no work to
morrow. They say there may be pj-me
men who will report for work, but they
will be so few that it will be almost im
posfible to carry on operations. The
coal companies will make a dct* j>crate et
fort to keep some of the mines going.

it is hoped to be able to mine some coai

strike is to show the strikers that some
mines are in operation and that some men
are doing work and being paid for work
that they should be doing and getting

make a prediction as to the outcome to
morrow.

SHAMOK1N*. Pa.. Sept. 16.â At 7:00
o'clock this evening the United Mine

going on strike to-morrow. In- whic-U
event the collieries cannot 'be operated;
Before the close of the week the United
Mine-workers expect to have most of the
operations in the district at a standstill.
The leaders say the operators and coai
companies underrate the strength of the
union.
The officials of the Philadelphia ant!
Reading Coal and Iron Company in this
district announced this evening- that -when
the colliery "whistles are blown to-mprrow
61 per cent of the employes will be at the
mines. The officials also stated that if
enough men stayod away from the mine
to compel the Henry Clay shaft to fihul
down the mules, would be hoisted, after
which the collif-ry would be abandoned.
The United Mine-workers claim that the
company will not permit the shaft to be
flooded.
Men Are Quiet.
Despite the fact that a considerable sum
of money had been disbursed by the Mln
t-ral and Union Coal companies yester
day, there has been little if any In
toxication among the miners and no dis
order has been reported from any of the
outlying mining hamlets. Everything was
quiet at the collieries between Trevor
ton, this place and Centralia to-day. No
miners wore at work and no one was in
the mines excepting the pumpmen and
tire bosses. In this place to-night the
streets were deserted save by people on
their way to and from the churches. Thu
miners are at home, "anxiously; awaiting
the developments of to-morrow morning.
A number of those intending to strike say
they will go to the collieries and Induce
men wanting to work to join the ranks of
the strikers.
Mass-Meeting Eeld.
A mass-meeting was held here this
afternoon, which was attended by be
tween 4000 and 5000 miners. They were
very enthusiastic over speeches by Sam
uel Gompers of the American Federation
of L<abor and John Fahey, president of
(he ninth anthracite district. Mr. Fahey
advised the men to stay away from the
mines and not indulge in Intoxicating
drink and avoid quarrels, which, would
tend to injure the cause of the miners.
President Gompers informed- his hearers
that by reason of their great patience in
sc-eking to induce the operators and co:il
companies to grant them a conference
and by the operators refusing to meet
them, the sympathy of tne American pub
lic was with the men. :-Thelr cause was a.
just one and by united action they would
win. They had the best kind of a chance
and considerable strength would be ac
corded tho United Mine-workers : by
kindred associations to defeat the operas
tors. The speaker also said that the
clergy made a mistake in advising the
men not to strike, but that the wrongs
of the worklngmen were so great that
they could not now recede an inch from
President Mitchell's order to strike, un
less the operators grant the desired con
cessions. Â¦--SBSSftj
HAZELTON, Pa,. Sept. 16.-President
Mitchell arrived here to-nitrht, and imme
diately ofter received a telegram, from
National Committeeman James, who is
at Jeddo, urging Mitchell to come to Jed
do at once and address the men, which he
did, calling on the Markle men to recon
sider their decision not to strike. The
Markle miners finally decldea to strike.
President Mitchell said he had reports
from the three anthracite districts which
indicate that 125,000 men will not start to
work to-morrow. He said the first and
ninth districts would be tied up to-night,
while the seventh would be almost so.

Costa Rica demanded the establish
ment or the old limits between Central
America and Colombia, which were at
Island Escudo tie Veragua on the Atlantic
and River Chiriqui Viejo (at the base of
Punta Burica to the southeast) in the Pa
cific.
The award upholds the claim of Costa
Rica and dispels the pretensions of Co
lombia to any part of the territory of
Nicaragua or of that of Costa Rica on the
Atlantic beyond Mona Point.
The award is important to the United
States because It places the mouth of tho
projected Nicaragua Canal unmistakably
in Nlcaraguan territory, and because it
will enable this Government to obtain a
coaling station on the Pacific Ocean,
which Colombia has refused to give. .
For some months past the United States
has been endeavoring to obtain permission
from the Colombian Government for the
establishment of coaling stations on the
shores of Chiriqui Lagoon and the Gulf
of Dulce, but the Colombian Government
declined to grant the request ostensibly
because the territory involved was in the
course of arbitration.
The Gulf of Dulce has now been* do
clared to lie within the boundary of Costa

PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 16.â That the strike of the mine workers in the anthracite coal regions of Pennsylvania,
which President Mitchell of the United Mine Workers of America has officially declared to begin to-morrow morn
ing 1 ,- -will be one of considerable magnitude seems certain to-night from reports received from the regions affected.
It seems equally certain that a number of operators will make an effort to run their collieries, even though they
may be short handed, but whether they will be successful can be determined only when the breakers' whistles sound
the call to work. The operators generally will have their collieries in condition to begin operations and the whistles will
blow as usual, but a large number of the employers admit that there is little hope of being able to start. To-day was
Â¦ one of quiet throughout the entire coal district. The mine workers were orderly, and their leaders were busy address
ing meetings to encourage the members of the union and to win over such non-union meii as they 'could. Many of
: these latter, although not favoring a strike, will, it is the general opinion, remain away from the mines rather than
bear the criticism and reproach of their fellow- workers. An effort is being made to-night to have Archbishop Ryan of
; Philadelphia act as arbitrator. Father Philipps of Hazelton, who has been laboring hard to effect a peaceful settlement
- of the labor troubles, was in conference at a late hour .with President Mitchell of the United Mine Workers, urging him
â¢ to delay the strike until Archbishop Ryan shall have exhausted his efforts.

STOPPAGE OF MILLS WILL

Spinners in England Are Unable to
Obtain Sufficient Supply of
Raw Cotton.
MANCHESTER. Sept. 16.â The Man-
Chester Textile Mercury ' estimates that
the minimum average of stoppage for the
mills will be eight weeks, although the
period may be longer, and that the losses,
including the wages of 500.000 workers, will
be Â£25,000,000. These losses are attributed
to the failure of nature to supply suffi
cient raw material. The English manu
facturer is totally dependent upon a cir
cumscribed area of foreign supply . and
those who provide this supply: are now
straining every nerve to consume the pro
duction at home, thus becoming form
idable competitors of England. -Â¦
"These competitors." says the Mercury,
"are the most formidable who could pos
sibly enter the markets of the world
against us. The remedy for the future
is the cultivation of. cotton within the
realm of Great Britain.

. nation's expansion.
When the first Continental Congress met in
Liberty Hall and the thirteen original Stales
declared themselves a nation the westward
limit of the country was marked by the Alle
ghany Mountains. Even during the Revolu
tionary war the work of expansion went on.
Kentucky, Tennessee and the Kreat Northwest,
then known afi the Illinois country, were con
quered from our white and Indian foes during
the Revolutionary struggle and was confirmed
to us by the treaty of peace in 17S3. Yet the
land thus confirmed was not then Riven to us.
It was held by an nllen foe until the army
under general Anthony Wayne freed Ohio from
the- red man., while the treaties of .lay and
Plnckney secured from the Spanish and .British
Natchez and Detroit.
In 1SC3, under President Jefferson, the great
est single stride In expansion that we ever took
was taken by the purchase of the Louisiana
territory. This so-called I^ouisana, which in
cluded what are now the States of Arkansas,

a.s the Philippines htrVo been acquired by treaty

doctrine of "the consent of the governed." the
doctrine previously enunciated by Jeft*erÂ«on ' In
the Declaration of Independence, was not 'held
by him i<Â» by any other sane man to apply to
the Indian tribes in the Louisiana territory,
which he thus acquired, and there was not a
vote taken even of the white inhabitants, not
to speak of the negroes and Indians, as to
whf-thcr they were willing that their territory
should be annexed. The great majority of the
inhabitants, white and colored alike, were bit
terly opposed to the transfer. An armed force
of United States soldiers had to be hastily
sent into the territory to prevent insurrection,
President Jefferson sending these troops to
Louisiana for exactly the same reasons and
with cxactlv the same purpose that President
McKinley has Bent troops to the Philippines.
Jefferson distinctly stated that the Loulsianans
were "not fit or ready for self-government."
and years elnpsed before they were given self
government. Jefferson appointing the Gover
nor and other officials without any consultation
with tha inhabitants of the newly acquired ter
ritory. The doctrine that the "constitution tol
lowfed the flag" was not then even considered,
either by Jetterson or by any other serious
party leader, for it never entered their heads
that a new territory should be governed other
than in the way in which the Territories of
Ohio ard Illinois had already been governed
under Washington and the elder Adams. The
theory known by this utterly false and mlsleaa
ing phrase was only struck out In political con
troversy at a much later date, for the sole
purpose of Justifying the extension of slavery
into the Territories.

intended that ultimately self-government
should be introduced throughout the territory,
but only as the different parts became fit for it,
and no sooner. This is just the policy that has
been pursued. In no part of the Louisiana
purchase was complete self-government Intro
duced for a numtw?r of years; In one part of
it, the Indian Territory, it has not yet been In
troduced, although nearly a century ha*
elapsed. Over enormous tracts of it, including
the various Indian reservations, with a terri
tory in the aggregate as large as that of the
Philippines, tlu> constitution has never yet
"followed the flag;" tha army officer and the
civilian agent still exercise authority without
asking the "consent of the governed." We must
proceed in the Philippines with the same wise
caution, taking each successive step as It be
comes desirable, and accommodating the de
tails of our policy to the peculiar needs of the
situation. But as soon as the present revolt is
put down and order established it will un
doubtedly be possible to give ti\e islands a
larger measure of self-government than Jefter
son originally gave Louisiana.
The next great step in expansion was the ac
quisition of Florida. This was partly acquired
by conquest and partly by purchase. Andrew
Jackson being the most prominent figure in
the acquisition. It was taken under President
Monroe, the aftertlme President John Quincy
Adams being active tn securing the purchase.
Ab in the case of the Philippines. Florida was
acquired by purchase from Spain, and In Flor
ida the Seminoles, who had not been consulted
in the sale, rebelled and waged war exactly as
snine of the Tagals have rebelled and waged
war In the Philippines. The Seminole War last
ed for many years, but Presidents. Monroe,
Adams and Jackson declined for a moment to
consider the question of abandoning: Florida to
the Seminoles. or to treat their non-consent to
the Government of the United States as a valid
reason for turning over the terrlotry to them.
Our next acquisition of territory was that of
Texas, secured by treaty after It had been
wrested from the Mexicans by the Texana
themselves. The,n came the acquisition of Cali
fornia. New Mexico. Arizona, Nevada and parts
of . Colorado and Utah as the result of the
Mexican War. "supplemented five years later
by the Gadsden purchase.
The next acquisition was that of Alaska, se
cured from Russia by treaty and purchase.
Alaska was full of natives, some of whom had
advanced well beyond the stage of savagery
and were Christians. They were not consulted
about the purchase nor was their acquiescence
required. The purchase was made by the men
who had just put through a triumphant war to
restore the Union and free the slave: but none
of them deemed it necessary to push the doc
trine of the "consent of the governed" to a
ally, and of all forms of industrial combina
tions in particular, and when this public de
nunciation is accompanied by private member
ship in th<Â» great Corporations denounced the
effect is, of course, to give an air of insincerity
to the whole movement. Nevertheless, there
are real abuses and there is ample reason for
striving to remedy thÂ»>ss abuses. A crude or
ill-considered eflort to remedy them would
either be absolutely without effect or else
would simply do damage.
â¢ The first thing to do is to find out the facts,
and for this purpose publicity as to capitali
zation, profits and all else of Importance to
the public is the must useful measure. The
mere fact of this publicity would In Itself rem
edy certain evils, and as to the others it would
In some cases point out the remedies and would
at least enable us to tell whether or not certain
proposed remedies would be useful. The state
acting in, its collective capacity would .thus
lirsl tlnd out the facts and then be able to take
such measures as wisdom dictated. Much can
be done by taxation. Even more can be done
by rejrulation. by close supervision *Â»r.d the un

and anti-social elements. The ufoarate State

posing the annexa
tion of the Islands,
stated: "These Isl
ands are more
than two thousand
miles distant from
em boundary.
"T" â¢ have a serious race
problem now in our country and I am not tn
favor of adding to our domestic fabric a mon
grel population (of this character). Our consti
tution makes no provision for a colonial es
tablishment. Any territorial government we
might establish would necessarily, because of
the population, be an oligarchy, which would
have to hv supported by armed soldiers." Yet
Hawaii has now been annexed and her dele
gates have sat in the national conventions of
the two great parties. The fears then ex
pressed in relation to an "oligarchy" and
"armed soldiers" are not now seriously enter
tained by any human being; yet they are pre
cisely the objections urged against tho acqui
sition of the Philippines at this very momen'.
We are making no pew departure. We are not
taking a single step which in any way affects
our Institutions or our traditional policies.
From the beginning we have given widely va
rying degrees of self-government to thÂ» differ
ent territories according to their needs.
The simple truth Is that there is nothing
even remotely resembllnz "imperialism" or
"militarism" Involved in the present develop
ment of that policy of expansion which has
been part -Â«f the- history of America from the
day when she became a nation. The words
mean absolutely nothing as applied to our pres
ent policy In the Philippines, for this policy
is or.ly Imperial istic In the sense that Jeffer
son's nolicy in law is imperialistic: only mili
tary in the sense that Jackson's policy toward
the Peminoles or Ouster's toward the Sio'ix
embodied militarism: and there is no more
dancer of its producing evil results at hope
now than there was of its Interfering with
freedom under Jefferson or JaoUson or in the
days of the Indian wars on the plains. Our
army is relatively not as large ae It was in
the days of Wayne: we have not one regular
for every 1000 Inhabitants. There is no more
danger of a draft than there is of the reintro
du^tion of slavery. . â¢ '
When we expanded over Mexico and Cali
fornia we secured free government to these
territories and prevented their falling under the
"militarism" of a dictatorship like that of
Santa Ana or the â¢â¢Imperialism" of a real
emnire In ihe days of Maximilian. We put a
ston to imperialism In Mexico as Boon aa the
civil war closed. We made a great antl-lm
i-eriallstic stride â¢ when we drove the Span
iards from Porto Kico and the Philippines
and thereby made rrady the ground in these
islands for that gradually increasing meas
ure of self-government for which their popu
lations are severally fitted. Cuba is beir.K
helped along the rath to Independence as
ra-ldly as her own citizens are content that
she should go. Of course the presence of
troops in the Philippines during the Tagal in
surrection has no more to jjn with militarism
or imoerialism than had tfieir rresence in the
Pakotas. Minnesota and Wyoming during the
many years which elapsed before the final out
breaks of the Sioux were definitely put down.
Tht-re is no more militarism or Imperialism
Jn earrisoninc Luzon untiV -order 13 restored
than there was Imperialism in sending . sol
diers to South Dakota in ISM during the !>gal
lala outbreak. The reasoning which justifies
our having made war against Sitting Bull also
Justified our havlnsr checked the outbreaks of
Asruinaldo and his followers, directed, aa they
were, ngainst Filipino ar.d American alike.
The onlv certain way of rendering It neces
narv for our republic to enter on a career of
"'militarism" would be to abandon the Phi!-
Ir-Tilr.es to their own tribes, and at the sane
time either to guarantee a stable Kovernrirnt
ftrr.onp these tribes or to guarantee them
ncalnst outside Interference. A far larger
army would be required to carry out any such
tk>1!ov than will be required to secure on'.er
under the American flap, while the presence
of this flat on the Islands Is really the only
no.'tibl'J security against outside aptfresslcn.
The whole argument against President McKin-
U-y's rolicy in the Philippln.es becomes abwurd
wbfti It Is conceded that we should, to quote
the language of thfi Kansas City platform,
"rive to the Philippines first a stable form
of rovernment." If they are now entitled to
Independence they are also entitled" to decide
for themselver whether their government sha'.l
be Ftable or unstable, civilized or savaÂ«re. or
whether they shall have any covernment at
all: while it is, of course, equally evident
that under such conditions we have no rljrht
whatever to guarantee them against outside
interference any more than we have to make
such a guarantee in the case of the FSoxers
(who are merely Chinese analogies of Aguin
alilo's followers). If we have a right to es
tablish a stable government in the islands it
necessarily follows that It Is not only our
rizht but our duty to support that govern
ment until the natives gradually grow fit to
pustaln It themselves. How else will It be
stable? The minute we leave it It ceases to
be stable.
Prooerly speaking, the question Is now not
whether we shall expand, for we have already

Â¦who are farsighted enough to see what the honor and interest of the

The policy of the frrs coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 is a
policy fraught with destruction to every homo in the land. It means
untold misery to the head of every household, and, above all, to the
tromen and children of every home.

MEXICAN WOMAN MnOG&DETLED.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Sept. 16.â Some time
during last Tuesday night Fermina
Ochoa, a Mexican woman about 50 years
of age, was murdered In a horrible man
ner at Yuma. Her body was found the
following morning in front of the house
where she had taken lodging the night
before. Her skull had been fractured by
a" blow on the forehead and a , piece of
cloth torn into strips and twisted into a
rope was tied around her throat so tight
ly as to produce strangulation, and there
was also a deep.knife wound in the body.
Suspicion was at once directed toward
Guillermo IJsaldo, with whom she had
been living for a long time and with
whom she had como from Fortuna the
night before. Part of his clothing was
found in her room. Evidence before the
Coroner's Jury showed that the woman
had considerable money, and it Is be
lieved Lisaldo killed her to secure this-
Usaldo is still at large, although officers
are making energetic efforts to arrest him.
A partner of Lisaldo haa been arrested.
His "coat cuff was saturated with- blood
and it is believed ho was implicated in
the killing.

FRESNO. Sept. 16.â John Brown, a
member of the Second Regiment of Volun
teers; was killed by a Southern Pacific
switch engine in the yards here this even
ing. Brown was dragged over seventy-five
yards and I mangled frightfully. How he
was struck is not known. The fact that
he was under the wheels was not discov
ered until the engine stopped, when his
body was seen by a brakeman. On the
dead man's body was found a certificate
entitling him to a six months' furlough
from the home for disabled volunteer sol
diers. In the cerflcate Tulare was named
as his destination during the furlough pe
riod.
F. Erickson, Janitor for the San Fran
cisco Gas, and Electric Light Company at
415 Post street, committed suicide last
night by inhaling illuminating gas. The
man had been drinking heavily for some
time, and was despondent. He took his
life i in a small room In the company's
building.
Erlckson was seen to enter the building
about 8 o'clock. ' When asked why he
came to the place so late he replied that
he had some work to do. The unfortunate
man then closed the door of his store
room, and, stretching himself out on the
floor, placed a tube leading from a gas
jet In his mouth. He was discovered an
hour later by M. Hurley, the night watch
man. Hurley at onco notified Chief En
gineer E. C. Jones and Dr. S. Newman.
Both gentlemen came to the scene and
labored hard for two hours In an attempt
to restore respiration, but were unsuc
cessful.
The body wag taken to the Morgue by
Deputies Brown and Donahue. Erlckson
was about 35 years of age, and resided
with his wife at 652 Mission street.

escape those Fitzslmmons' punches of the
shark."
The spectators of the flght feel that, not
only were they witnesses of a rare spec
tacle, but that they made a contribution
to science. In the latest edition of the
Encyclopedia Brltannlca Dr. Albert Gun
ther, the great ichythyologist,- in an
article on "Sharks," has the folowing to
say of Alopecias vulpes, or the thresher:
"Statements that it has been seen to at
tack whales and other large cetaceans
rest upon erroneous observations; its
dentition is much too weak to bite through
skin, although by one splash of its taii
it may put a herd of dolphins or por
poises to flight like so many hares."
Dr. Gunther had evidently heard stories
second-hand of such attacks. As Genera;
Barnes points out, the shark's attack was
not made with Its teeth as weapons. It
simply hammered at the whale, while the
swordflsh lunged with its sword.
length above the water, his white belly,
white as milk, shining in the sun as he
turned for his dive upon the back or head
of his foe. We could see him as he left
that great white column of foaming wa
ter as plainly as if it had been an alba
tross.
"The sight was beyond expression terri
fyingâto see those monsters battling
there and to see the enormous power of
that thrasher to rise and turn for all
the world like a diver poised in his leap
from a springboard.
"An amazing thing was the enormous
commotion in the water. The surface was
kept churned to a foam. The battle was
most desperate. The shark must have
leaped into the air twelve or fifteen times.
The combatants were working shoreward,
in the general direction that we were sail
ing, but a^. the whale became tired and
its flight less frantic, the distance be
tween yacht and combatants increased.
Wnale Gives Up the Ghost.
"Finally we saw the whale rise and
spout again and then suddenly go down
like a foundered ship. The fight was over;
the whale had lost. The shark made one
more leap and plunged back, striking the
rolling body of the foe <i.s it sank. \
"The whale was a monsterâ eightv feet
in length, I should sayâ but he was no
match for his savage foes. I would not
have missed that battle for a thousand
dollars."
"I understand," Judge Sanderson said,
"that lighthouse keepers occasionally see
such' combats, rather close in shore, but
that seafaring men may go to sea a life
time and not be so fortunate. The shark
was apparently about thirty feet long,
the whale about eighty. They mon
sters. I should say we were within 200
yards of them. We would see a commo
tion in the water, then a foaming-, splash
ing column of water would shoot into the
air, and above it would rise the grayish
body of the shark.
"It was a running fight, and the shark
and swordflsh were driving the whale
Inshore. The wonderful ability of the
shark to throw itself out of the water
twenty feet into the air was most as
tounding-. There is no doubt that the
whale was vanquished. It turned belly
up as It rolled and sank Into the depths."
Prize Fight Not a Marker.
This is the way T. H. Williams Jr. de
scribed the combat:
"It was worth all the prize-fights I ever
saw. I'd choose it before any slugging
match that could be arranged. There was
no fakinir. that's dead sure. It was a
licht to the finish, with no'Horton law
In the way.
"General Barnes saw the shark first.
Then the whale came up and spouted.
All of a sudden, whish went the shark
clean out of the water and came down
whack on the side of the whale.
"I think we must have been 400 yards
away, but we could see the monsters
plainly. Usually we saw but eight or ten
feet of the back of the whale when he
came up to spout, rolling like a porpoise.
"The thrasher kept .right after the
whale, , and the swordflsh was evidently
making things lively from beneath. The
thrasher's head looked square-muzzled,
like the head of a hippopotamus and
seemed fire or six feet across.
"The fight lasted all of twenty minutes,
with the shark leaping into the air every
minute or two. I wanted to get in closer
and wanted the commodore to bring the
yacfit about, but a delicious clam chow
der had Just been served and the commo
dore said the soup would be spilled if we
came about. 'Damn the soup,' I- said,
'let's see the fight.' But the commodore
fwas in command and we didn't come
about. Leake and I kept pumping away
with our rifles at the shark, but we were
too far away to know whether we hit
or not.
"After about fifteen .rounds* of the
fight it was evident that tho whale was
losing interest and he seemed willing to
call it a draw. The thresher was game,
though and hung right to him. The
whale began to lumber along, not up to
his speed by any means. A dead heat
would have Battened him. But he couldn't

jresterday afternoon ju^t outside
th<= beads. The torriiic conflict was wit-
DCSsed by pleasure seekers aboard the
yiichts Lurlino and Tramontana and a
half-rater and by the crew of a lumber
?hoontr pouthward bound. It was a bat*
tie to ihr- death, and th<? great whale,
pummfled by the thrasher and stabbed by
the Btrcrdflsb. was finally vanquished.
Aft< r an hour of alternate combat
and fight from his relentless foes, the le

fountain of Bprajr dyed with his life- blood
high Into Tho air and sunk as a ship sinks
â¢wh'-n the hold has filled.
TIk- witnesses of this rare sight agree
that it was the- most awe-inspiring spec

Ftory of such combats Is familiar to every
seafaring man. many an old salt sails

re<iitary enemies.
The mon*ten of the deep churned the
water into a boiling, foaming whirlpool.
The whale plowed , his way along with
the energy of desperation and tho resist
less force of his huge frame. In his ef
forts to escape the persistent and vicious
attacks of the fox-shark, he would try to
sound, only to be forced back to the sur
face by the thrusts of the swordfish from
below. Every time he came up the great
mammal would send skyward a fountain
cf silvers* spray. â¢ That same instant a
column of water would be suddenly
thrown upward, as if by ah explosion be
neath the surface, and in that column
Â¦would appear the gray body of the
thrasher or fox-shark, spreading its two
huge, wing-like fins. The thrasher
would turn in the air like a diver and fall

would eink beneath the surface together.

the water again and a short distance
from Where it disappeared a great whale
suddenly came rushinj? to the surface anrl
spouted. As the back of the monster was
disappearing again a column of water
was thrown into the air a distance of
twelve or fifteen feet and the amazed
spectators saw the great, square-nozed,
long-fmnt-d thrasher poised in the air for
a mornr-nt. Then it turned with a down
ward curve and fell head first upon the
back of the whale.
The battle was on. Whether it had
tieen in progress fjr some time the
yachtsmen, of course, are unable to say,
though they are inclined to think thai
they saw the beginning. Thp second timo
the thrasher appeared on the surface it
was close under tho bow of a lumber
schooner, whose crew bad not yet sighted
thecombattants. Later on they wore equal
ly, mtprf.stpd with the yachtsmen in the
aquatic combat. Somewhat later a small
sailboat ran close in to the maddened
Kiants and those aboard it saw a part of
the struggle at a distance of 200 feet.'
On board the yachts the spectators
watched with intense Interest, their sport
inp: blood stirred to tho tingling point.
And yt't it wjis moro than that. They
watched 'with feelings of awe, as if they
looked upon sf>ir.<? convulsion of nature.
The sense of awful power embodied in
the pl'inpfs of the whale and the leaps
and headlong dives of the thrasher was
overwhelming. That feeling in the hearts
of the yachtsmen was not lessened by the
knowledge of what their fate would be
should the giants dash against their ves
sel in their blind rage.
Such catastrophe did not happen, how
ever, and the whale began to show the
effects of the thrasher's terrible hammer
ing. Its final struggle and sudden sink
ing-, an Inert, rolling: mass, was not the
least awe-inspiring of the features of the
battle.
No Fish Story This Time
"The battle was certainly awful," Gen
eral Barnes said last evening. "I had
vowed to say nothing about it for publi
cation. If I alone had seen it I would
never have mentioned it even to my most
intimate friends. They would have said
it was a flsh story too wild to be any
thing but purely a creation of an over
fitimulated imagination. But witnesses
were numerous. It was before luncheon,
too, and no man's powers of observation
were at all clouded or stimulated.
"We had just' come about after the tack
south of west, and were probably three
and a half mllos off Point Bonita light.
We were loading the Tramontana, which
Â¦was to the north of us. when I saw a sort
of gray column rise from the water at a
point probably 300 or 400 yards back of us
and a. little north, so that it was rather
nearer to Simpkins' yacht. The object
poised perpendicularly. like a huge
stumpy post sticking up out of the water.
"I thought It was a whale., but its fins
tht-n protruded above water, and Commo
dore Sprocktls recognized it as a thrasher
shark. It sank bark into the water and
as we looked a monster whale came rush
ing to the surface as if in desperate
IMght. and throw a silvery spray high up
into the air.
"Suddenly we paw a column of water
rise, exactly as if there had been a sub
marine explosion. Out of that column of
water there rose a huge body, certainly
twenty feet in length nt the very least,
with RTeat flns spread out like* wings.
That monster rose out of the water
twenty feot if an inch. It was the most
stupendously surprising thing I ever saw.
Then the great thing turned with the
grace of a diver and came down
with its square, hammor-like head
first, upon the back of the hunted whale,
and both disappeared.
"When the whale appeared a^ain it was
â¢vidcrit that there was trouble for It be
low, and presently we saw what was
causing it. A swordfish. missing Its mark
as it lunged upward at the whale, showed
half above the water and then sank back
horizontally.

The policeman accosted him and the man

him.
The policeman was just in the act of
grabbing the fugitive when two more men
appeared on the scene. One of them hit
Marston over the head with a rope's end
and then all three of the rogues jumped
onto the police officer. He was kicked in

Before losing consciousness Marston
pulled his pistol and fired three shots.

Special Dispatch to The Call,
SEATTL.E, Wash., Sept. 16.â In one of
the darkest corners of Gloomy Black
Chapel, in the lower part of town, was
fought a pitched battle about 3:30 this
morning between Police Officer Fred A.
Ribbach and three armed and desperate
law-breakers. As a result Edward Morse,
alias Edward Moore, alias Jack Baker a
former Minnesota shingle weaver, who
went to Nome and there wandered from
the paths of honesty, lies in the Morgue
with a bullet through his heart, and Jack
MansHeld; alias Jack Dougherty, another
of the gang, occupies a cell in the city
jail. Harry Austin, the third man, was
wounded in the arm and captured through
information gained from a surgeon to
whom he applied for treatment. A fourth
man was seen with the gang during the
evening, but he cannot be found.
Officer Ribbach. who fought until his
revolver was empty, sending the last shot
into Morse's heart, escaped without in-
Al though less than three blocks from the
police station, many crimes have been
committed in that neighborhood. A va
cant lot lies between a saloon and a Cm
nese store. Across the front of the lot
is a high billboard. There are no alleys
entering the block and no way in which
light from the street can penetrate it, and
in this black hole Ribbach faced and
fought three desperate men.
The three and their companion, who
was not mixed in the melee, had been
seen prowling around that neighborhood
for several hours. The owner of the Chi
nese store complained to Ribbach that
they were trying to enter one of his
windows. 'me policeman kept close
watch, and about 3 o'clock saw the three
men going into the lot through a small
door in the billboard. He followed with
out hesitation, and as soon as his eyes
became somewhat accustomed to the
darkness distinguished the forms of the
men. He at once accosted them and de
manded to know thoir business. Receiv
ing an insulting reply from one of them,
he attempted to seize him, but the man,
who proved to be Morse, grappled with
the olticer. After a short struggle Morse
broke away, taking refuge behind a wag
on, which stood in the lot. As the officer
followed Morse drew his revolver and
fired almost directly in Ribbach's face,
at the same time running to the other
side of the wagon. The officer at once
returned the lire and across the wagon a
fusillade was kept up, in which one of
Morse's companions joined. â¢*'
The sound of the tiring brought other
officers hastily to the scene, and upon
their approach two of the desperadoes
took to their heels. Just at this moment
Ribbach with the last shot in his gun
killed Morse and turned to pursue the
others. He succeeded in capturing Mans
fleld. but the other man got away.
But little is known of Morse by the lo
cal police, save that during his stay here
he has been regarded as a suspicious
character. He is said to have come out
from Minnesota about a year ago and
joined the rush to Nome. He returned
from the northern camp within the last
month. Ho Â¦was about 37 years old.
Mansfield, who is a younger man, re
fuses to talk. He has a bad record with
the police, having been arrested for va
grancy several times and under surveil
lance as a suspect for other offenses.
Austin, who is IS years of age, con
fesses to the criminal intent of himself
and Morse, but seeks to exonerate Mans
field. He says Morse learned that the
Chinese merchant, whose place they were
trying to enter, had just sold a big lot of
opium and had the money concealed
about the store.

BATTLES WITH
THREE CROOKS
There was a hot contest at the Califor
nia Tennis Club grounds yesterday.
Racquets were not used, but enough noise
anjd excitement was engendered to satisfy
the most ardent lover of such things.
Robert Whitney, brother of the cham
pion, and a tennis expert of no mean abil
ity himself,* brought on what proved" the
sensation of the day.
Robert struck H. W. 'Crowell on the
face with his clenched fist and the lat
ter, disregarding the rules of the peaceful
game, returned the play with interest. No
net separated the contestants, so that
every blow landed inside the court. Thfi
game started by Mr. Whitney accusing
Mr. Crowell of being a pervtrrer of
truth and no gentleman. . Mr. Crowe li
could not permit this assertion to go i.n
challengetl before the large gathering
present, so he denied the allegation. Ht
threw off his coat and the game went on.
He served a right swing to Mr. Whitney
and was entitled to 15 love, according to
the rules of the game, but Robtrt re
turned the play and landed on the jaw.
making it 15 all and very weary for Cro
well. The latter came back with an over
hand stroke, which was cleverly lobbed
by Whitney. Crowell served again and
this time his fist landed on Whitney's eat
ing department and the score stood 30â 1Z
in Crowell's favor. Robert side-steppea
round the court for a few seconds and
with a straight drive caught Crowell ou
the ear, evening the score with 30 all.
Gore began to flow and the spectators be
came too interested to interfere.
George Whitney, who was scoring the
game, forgot himself for the nonce and
began to advise Crowell how to defeat
brother Bob. Play being resumed, Cro
well returned a volley and sent a cork
screw left to Whitney's unprotected court
and the score stood 40 â Co. The game be
gan to be fast and furious. Both men
led time and again and fell short and
then Whitney, with a move that would
have made Sharkey happy, landed flush
on Crowell's pearly teeth and the game
was deuce. There was vantage on one
side and then the other and when the
game was called both players in this fistic
comedy resembled men who had been
pulled through a threshing machine. They
were covered with gore and dust and
their clothes presented a very dilapidated
appearance. Spectators prevented a re
newal of the game, but a challenge for a
return contest was made and accepted on
the spot.
The match was brought about through
Robert Whitney's criticism of W. D. Col
lier, H. W. Crowell and his brother,
George F. Whitney. The three last named
were members of the committee which ar
ranged the tennis tournamnt held at Del'
Monte last week. In former years the
hotel management has contributed $250
for prizes as an inducement to the racquet
wielders to play their championship
games on the ground of the hostelry.
This year but $60 was contributed by the
hotel people, but the latter agTeed to pay
the railroad expenses of the committee
and board its members free during the
tournament. This offer was evidently ac
cepted and did not meet with the approval
of impetuous Robert Whitney. During
the contests at the local court yesterday
Robert indiscreetly made audible com
ments, which, in addition to an article
which he contributed on the subject to a
local newspaper, fanned the flames in the
breasts of Brother Georg-e and Air.
Crowell. The latter took up the quftrrel
and within a few minutes hot words were
being hurled across the court with greater
speed than a tennis ball manipulated by
racquets In the hands of experts. When,
the lie was passed Crowell made a Jump
for Whitney and the battle ensued.
It is thought that Mr. Collier, who was
included In the criticisms hurled by the
Impassioned Robert, and who plays a
clever game with his fists, -will challenge
Whitney to a set or setto. The outcome
of this match hajf aroused more interest
than a championship contest between
Champion George Whitney and one of the
Hardys. Â¦ .

San Francisco, September 16.
Editor Callâ A scene was enacted in
Judge Carroll Cook's court last Friday
afternoon which I believe to be without
parallel in the judicial history of this or
any other civilized country, and which
every lover of justice and fair play In San
Francisco will pray may never be repeat
ed within the limits of our fair city.
It was a scene that ought to brtng tho
blush of shame to the cheek of every just
man and woman in this city. It is doubt
ful if such an outrage would be tolerated
anywhere in the dominions of the Czar of
Kussia, the Sultan of Turkey or the Snah
of l'ersla.
A woman, a citizen of this free city, who
has bt-tn confined to her bed for tne last
three montns by severe illness, and wno
was, a wcck ago, stricken witn paralysis
involving half ner body, was compenea by
order 01 judge Cook to attend ms courc
to oe arraigned upon a lengthy indict
ment, aespite the tact that tnree repu
tabieanu uistinguished physicians hadcer
uned to her ntipiess condition and to the
fiangtr ot compelling her attendance in
court under the circumstances.
Une cruel order was carried out by three
L>t?puty sheritis. who lifted the unfortun
ate woman, sick almost unto death, from
her bed at the Palace Hotel and earned
her into the courtroom. \ Â¦
It is not for me to pass judgement upon
the ease of this lady whom, as I under
stand, the law presumes to be innocent
until she is proved to be guilty, but I am
decidedly of the opinion mat the ends of
justice neither demand nor justity the
cruel and unseemly haste insisted upon In
this matter.
She is my patient and I feel that I
would be derelict in my duty to her as
rny patient and recreant to every senti
ment of humanity if I did not enter my
earnest protest against such a barbarous
proceeding.
From my point of view the conduct of
Judge Cook in the matter was absolutely
inexcusable and wholly unjustifiable, and
if the unhappy woman had died under the
cruel ordeal to which he subjected her he
would have been morally, and I believe
legally, responsible for her death.
In conclusion I wish to say that^Mrs^
Craven-Fair has not sought '^refuge from
the law under the plea- of Insanity." On
the contrary she has been anxious to ap
pear in court. and answer the charge of
perjury -which she denounces as false and
infamous. Her inability owing to sick
ness to so appear and answer has great
ly annoyed and worried her.

MRS. CRAVEN.
DOMESTIC TR^DE.
nAD it not been for the cyclone along the Gulf
and the threatened coal-miners' strike the com
mercial situation last week would have worn a
rosy aspect. The former cut down the receipts of
the Southern railroads immensely and did more or
less damage to cotton, and the latter served to render
Eastern capital more or less timid as to its opera
tions in the near future. Otherwise trade reports
were better than for tome time. Orders for iron and
steel were reported increasing, a number of steel
mills announced a speedy resumption of work and
i! c Michigan car plant and the Deering Harvester
Works started up again after nearly two months of
idleness. Jobbers and retailers, in the West and
South reported 3 better distribution of goods. In
New England the boot and shoe trade showed signs
of recovery from the lassitude of the past several
months, new orders being received and idle factories
starting up again, though shipments from Boston
continued light.
Cotton was the liveliest staple of the week. Closing
prices of the preceding week wire the highest for
ten years, but the Gulf cyclone gave the market a
further impetus and it advanced by bounds, the rise
in the raw cotton causing a corresponding advance in
the manufactured goods. Prospects for large profits
to cotton-planters are stimulating all lines of trade in
the South, especially as -the .English spinners are
seriously short of .supplies and the more sanguine
bulls are even predicting a famine in cotton before the
close of the season. Wool, however, continues weak,
with a disappointing demand for woolen goods.
In most food products the tendency is upward.
Supar is advancing right along, bacon is higher and
coffee v]ioÂ»s more tone. The other leading food
Maples show less change.
The bank clearings of the past week broke the
monotonous record of a 16 per cent loss, which has
prevailed for son:e time, by dropping to 22 per cent
below 1899, though some oi the largest chits, such as
Chicago, St. Louis, etc., which have steadily lost for
month?, veered around and exhibited a gain. New
York and Boston continue to lag behind last % year.
The failures for the week numbered 195, against 149
for the same week in 1899.
Apathy still prevails in Wall street. The market
-holly given over to the professionals, who are
t.'rrvous over the threatened coal strike and dis
inclined to risk their precious dollars until they see
v.hich way the cr.t is going to jump. London is also
looking cross-eyed at the strike and that bourse, too,
is rcpo-'ed dull and featureless.
In San Francisco there is not much new to report.
Steady orders for all sorts of things for Alaskan and
Government account preserve this market from
even the semblance of dullness and the local whole
salers report themselves very well satisfied with the
state of trade. It has been a very good summer here
and the fall bids fair to turn out equally brisk. Specu
lation on the different financial and commercial ex
changes continues dull, but the movement of actual
merchandise is and has been good. There are no
failures sufficiently large to excite comment, the sup
ply of money is ample for all necessitites and collec
tions are as easy as they ever arc. As a rule farm
produce h bringing good prices, though the fruit men
sre not doing as well as they did last year, owing
chiefly to the small size of the fruit, which affects
prices. In this respect the fruit crop of the State has
been somewhat of a disappointment, as The Call pre
dicted as far hack as last spring, when the most
rxagarerr.ted estimates of the State's yield were scat
tered broadcast all over the United States, to the great
::i;ury of the markets. It is bad business policy to
proclaim enormous crops to the world, for it invari
ably causes Eastern ar.d foreign buyers to expect low
prices in consequence and to reduce their bids ac
cordingly. Still, this ie what California has been sys
tematically doinc for years-
THE VAAL RIVER COLONY.
WITH the fligbt of Kruger to Portuguese terri
tory the last fragment of the South African re
public ends. Botha and Dewet and certain
minor leaders may struggle in arms for a time, but
they do not even pretend to constitute a government,
and their struggles will not be counted as war. The
Transvaal republic has passed out of existence, and in
place of it is the British province known as "Va;il
River Colony."
The event in South Africa will doubtless hi
promptly follpwed by v dissolution of Parliament and
a call for the election of a new one. The Salisbury
Ministry has been successful in war. and the time is
therefore favorable for making an appeal to the coun
try. Moreover, it will be good statesmanship as well
as good party politics to have a new Parliament at
this time. The present Parliament is nearly at the
i-.nd of its term, and is therefore unfitted to undertake
a work which will of necessity cover a long series of
years, and such a work will be that of reconstructing
South Africa. Naturally, before entering, upon the
work. Salisbury will ?ppeal to the country and ask a
new lease of power.
The elections will at once raise an issue concerning
the policy to be pursued in the conquered country.
Many of the British Liberals have been opposed to the
annexation of the two. South African republics, but
the annexation is now accomplished and the Liberals
will have to devise some other ground upon which to

The new royal yacht Victoria and Albert
has passed through two of her stipulated
trials of forty-eignt hours at sea with sat
isfactory results. The first was under
one-half power, which gave- 6142 horse
power and a speed of 16.3 knots with a coal
consumption of 1.94 pounds. The second
trial, also of forty-eight hours, developed
7625 horsepower and an average speed of
18.3 knots, the coal consumption being
again 1.&4 pounds as on the first trial. The
yacht was to start on August 25 for her.
final trial of eight hours under full power,
during which she is expected to mak,e
twenty knots with 11,000 horsepower. The
vessel is down, to her load draught and
displaces 4700 tons.
The Russian cruiser Novik was launched
at Elbing August 15. She is intended to
be the fastest war vessel of her type and
size in the world, and being fitted with
triple screws and engines of 18,000 horse-'
power she is likely to attain such a speed
on a displacement of only 3000 tons. She
is 347 feet 10 inches in length and 40
feot beam. Her coal capacity is 500 tons,
sufficient for 6000 miles at ten knots, and
her armament consists of six 6-lnch and
six 4.7-inch rapid-fire g'una, besides
smaller machine 'guns.
The joint Invention of Degraz and Bal
thazar, two French engineers, is of the
greatest value to submarine craft and is
claimed to do all that the inventors prom
ised as far back as February, 1S99. They
make use of dioxide of sodium, which,
under the action of water becomes oxy
gen and soda. The latter Is then utilized
to absorb the carbonic acid of the vitiated
air, thus keeping the supply of oxygen
pure. ___
Psilander, Swedish torpedo cruiser, had
her official trial last month at Stockholm
and made a speed of 20.5 knots with 4500
horsepower. The vessel is of 800 tons and
is fitted, like all the latest vessels in the
Swedish navy, with Yarrow watertube
boilers. A sister ship will shortly be fin
ished and four small armored I vessels of
3650 tons and 5000 horsepower are under
construction in Swedish yards.
Wireless telegraphy is being established
along the coast of England. The old
armored- cruiser Minotaur, located at
Portsmouth, is having a mast built 180
feet in height. Five other masts of 150
feet are to be placed on as many head
lands between and including Dover and
the Scllly Islands.
Ansaldo, the noted shipbuilder at Genoa,
has sold two twenty-six knot torpedo
boats to Turkey for $334,400. The boats
were built for the Italian navy, but the
straightened condition of that country's
finances permitted the sale of the boats
she was unable to pay for.
The British cruiser Isis, 5600 tons, aver
aged I6V2 knots speed on her voyage from
the Mediterranean to Hongkong. She is
fitted with the old type (Scotch boilers)
which Mr. Allen is pure to make a note of,
to confuse the advocates of watortube
boilers.
Krupp. fhe great gunmaker at Essen,
has received a large order for guns for
the Turkish navy.
THE WORLD'S WARSHIPS
Minister of Marine and one of his first
acts was to strike off the list and order
the sale of no less than fifty vessels. Most
of these condemned ships were antiquated,
but there were also some new, notably the
cruiser Lepanto of 4S26 tons, launched in
1SS2 and credited with a speed of twenty
knots. The boilers of nearly all the ships
which remain on the active list are in a
bad state, those of the armored cruiser
Carlos V. launched in 1S35. and the Pe
layo's, put in only two years ago, require
renewal. The sum of $4,600,000 was voted
for the personnel of officers, 4500 seamen
and 3500 marines, but most of the money
goes to maintain the dockyards at Ferrol,
Cadiz and Carthagena. and the Admiralty,
which swarms with officers of high rank,
tenor Suveia is confronted with the dilem
ma of permitting things to go on as usual
or to ask the Cortes to reorganize the
naval service to reform abuses and abol

PERSONAL MENTION.
F ROM bad to worse is the record of the reports
j that follow one another from Texas. The first
wild dispatches after the storm estimated the
number of dead at 2000. then came the Mayor's esti
mate, made after three clays of examination of the
wreck, that the number would reach 5000; now th2
reports intimate that while the total list of the dead
will never be known, it will not fall short of Sooo and
may reach 10,000.
Another sad feature of the later reports is the reve
lation that the destructive force of the hurricane was
almost as dreadful in its effects in the districts ajound
Galveston as in the city itself. From the smaller
towns and the villages and from the plantations come
story after story of death- and disaster and appeal
aj'jcr ?pfcal for help, for food, for medicine and for
money. When all i> known it will probably he found
that in loss of life this has been the most appalling
calamity that ever befell the United States and that
in loss of money it will be inferior only to the fires
that swept Chicago and Boston. .
One of the dread evils of the situation in Galves
ton is the fear of pestilence arising from the unburied
dead. Hundreds of bodies lying upon the beach or
floating about the bay are decomposing and rilling
the air with gerrris of disease. It is therefore under
the most depressing and horrible circumstances that
the busy people are trying to bring order out of. con
fusion, to bury their dead, to feed the starving, to
heal the sick and the wounded, to give work to the
idle, to check the looting by thieves and to get ready
for the rebuilding of their homes. All that can be
done by kind hearts and liberal hands to assist them
in that -work should be done. There should be no
i.igKardi'ness in the help given. Let it go forward
abundantly and promptly, for it is needed in full meas
ure and it is needed now.
Contributions from all the States of the Union hive
thus far been most liberal and the people of California
have well upheld the traditions of the generosity of
their State. We must not, however, be content with
what has been done. So long as every report from
Texas shows an increasing magnitude of suffering,
so long must each day show an increased subscription
to the relief fund. "Human virtue," as Robert Lee
said, "should^ be equal to human calamity." This has
been one of the most appalling calamities of our time
and t'r.eiefcre the virtue of the American people
should show itself more potently than ever. For the
relief of a distress so dreadful there should be ex
hibited a record-breaking generosity.

Thus it will be seen it would be useless to fly to
Nome for relief from problems and from politics.
Sar. Francisco folks might as well stay at home.
Ii will be seen that Nome has many of the problems
of larger and less golden cities. Moreover, it appears
the people purpose to deal with them there much as
they are dealt with elsewhere, by using them as in
centives to political action. We are told: "The Nome
Progress Club, started in the interest of municipal im
piovements. will ere long be exercising its energies
in the political field, if the speech delivered before
the club last night by Rev. Raymond Robbins may be
taken as a keynote. The club's members are, for
the most part, responsible business men and it is very
much to be hoped they will not be idle in any cam
paign fought in' Nome this fall." ,
One of the editorials of the paper demands the en
forcement of some system of compelling vagrants to
work. It says: "There is a law for % r agrancy in every
other city in the United States; why should there no;
be one here? There are no doubt many deserving
poor in Nome, but there are also any number of
criminals, confidence men and dissolute characters,
who shrink from the suggestion of honest work as the
devil shrinks from holy water, and who would not
turn their hand to labor were they paid $10 a minute
for so doing. Many of these people are so well
known that there would be no difficulty at all in
getting at them. Nome needs many improvements
that require the services of hard-working laboring
men. Why not put a liberal interpretation on the
vagrancy law, arrest these fellows and put them where
they will be forced to hustle for the general good of :i
community to which they are now a disgrace and 1
danger. A few such arrests, followed by swift pun
ishment, will start an exodus that will open the eyes
of those who are worrying over plans with which to
meet the situation."
Some of the items of news run thus: "Smallpox
goes, rain comes, but the footpad is with us forever. â
The people who appear to be receiving the chief
benefits of this country are aptly known as 'receiv
ers.' â The question of caring for the indigent poor 'u
still agitating the community. What is to be done
with the other portion of the population â the indigent
rich? â Governor Brady has great ideas of the agricul
tural future of Alaska. We hope he is right. We
confess, however, that the climate and soil of the
Nome district seem better suited for raising legal
technicalities than for the production of potatoes."
There appear to be a good many good things lack
ing in the city. The Chronicle says Nome must hive
fire and police protection, sidewalks and street cross
ings. To obtain such things it will be necessary to
incorporate and to incorporate it will be necessary
to get Judge Noyes to consider a petition for incor
poration; but it is said by the Chronicle that the Judge
has been too busy to give audience to merchants or
consideration to such subjects as municipal improve
ment, so that it is still an open question whether
Nome is to be a self-governed city or not.
From the first- number of the paper we learn many
interesting things about Nome. A picture on the
first page, presenting a view of the principal thor
oughfare of the camp on a rainy day, shows a team
passing the Chronicle office with the horses knee
deep in vvater. Another picture, showing the ''largest
mercantile store in Nome," exhibits a good-size.d
barn two stories high, with a Jofty attic. We are told
the dimensions of the structure are 40x140 feet, the
work of erecting it occupied a full week and the cost
of the lot on which it stands was $50,000 The thir!
and last picture of the number is a cartoon of a wolf
in the clothing of a man and is labeled "The Nome
Reach Wrecker at Work." A paragraph points
the moral of the artist in the statement, "The only
way for a wrecked seaman to save the money on Iris
person is to sink before reaching the beach."

SOCIETY: ITS DELIGHTS AND
ITS MANY WORRIES
BY SALLY SHARP.
challenge the triumphant Tories. Doubtless they
will favor granting to the Boers a large measure of
self-government, while the Conservatives will pro
pose a more stringent policy. It will be an excellent
test of the temper of the British constituencies cm the
subject of respect for the rights of the conquered, and
the election will engage the attention of liberty lovinj
people in all parts of the world.
In the meantime 'Dewet and Botha have not yet
been captured. The armed resistance to British con
trol goes on, and it will be necessary for the empire
to maintain there a large force for many years ' to
come. That fact will have no little influence upon the
mind of 'the British voters and may incline them to
support the Tories in whatever plans they formulate
for holding the Boers in subjection. The chances of
the success of the Liberals are therefore very slight.
The Tories are likely to have control of Parliament
tor another seven years, and since Salisbury, on ac
count of his age, can hr.rdly hold the Premiership that
long, the prospects that Chamberlain will become^
Frime Minister of Great Britain and attain an earldom
.-â¢re exceptional'}' good. >f,
The choice between prosperity or disaster has to be
made by the people at the polls and none will have i
vote in making the choice except those who have regis
tered. The closing days' of registration are at hand.
Delay any longer will be dangerous. Get 3'our name
on the list of voters and then see to it that your
friends do likewise.
There is no law by which a man can be forced *o
attend to his political duties except the great unwrit
ten laws of patriotism and of self-interest. He that
is heedless of thoec laws may neglect to register, re
fuse to vote and mock at every other public respon
sibility which citizenship imposes upon him. but he
cannot do so with impunity. When workingmen,
business men. capitalists and professional men neglect
politics and leave the eloctions to the control of the
bosses and the gangs that follow them, they have to
pay the penalties which had government imposes, and
the penalties of a Bryan government will be heavy in
deed.
There is no reason why the vote of this year should
i>c less than tlyit of 18)6. The issues arc virtually the
same. The menace of Bryanism is as portentous now
as then. The election of an obstinate man, without ex
perience in business or in statecraft and almost
fanatically devoted to free silver, free trade and a de
clared antagonism .to large corporations and to the
Supreme Court of the United Stales, would certainly
tend to disturb the industrial, commercial and ti:nn
cial affairs of the country to such an extent as to lend
to something like a t:niversnl panic. The losses tint
would result from the success of Bryan would fall
upon every business interest and would be fe't by
every class of citizens. Why then should there be any
indifference among intelligent men tr> the issues of
the campaign?
Up 10 this tiir.e the registration is something like
â¢2C.f:oo less than the number of voters who qualified
for the election <>i 1896. Hie population of the city
has increased during the four years and in the natural
order of things the enrollment of voters should in
crcTse with it. It i> therefore evident that there will
be cither a considerable number of citizens who will
sacrifice their votes :>r a heavy rush during the clos
ing days of registration. In 1 all probability the
hater is what will take place and consequently tho*c
who have rot yet placed their names on the roll
should hasten to do so. Every one who cm find the
time should register Jo-day.

saying:
"The Paris Exposition is the greatest

plays of manufactures, in science and in
art, tho exposition Is simply complete.
There is not a line of anything used by
man for transportation, comfort or lux
ury In any branch of manufacture which
is lacking. Its educational value is prac
tically illimitable. I fail to understand
upon what are based the adverse criti
cisms indulged in not only by visitors ig
norant of expositions, but by intelligent
ajid prominent citizens. I am afraid
many of these have not observed care
fully or at length.
"I am proud to say that the Americans
took 2000 awards, or one-third of the en
tire number awarded. The Americans at
the exposition were the most lavish enter
tainers of any nation and of the Ameri
cans the most enthusiastic hosts were the
Californians. The people from my State
spent $130,000 In taking care of. guests and
friends. If all the States had done as

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.
âInstructions have been sent to
Major General Chaffee not to agree
to any solution of the Peking situ
ation which does not safeguard the na
tive Christians there under the protection
of American missions.
These instructions were based upon the
recommendation of Minister Conger and
representations made by the Board or
Missions. It is further stated by the au
thorities that in the settlement of the
Chinese question it will be the aim of
this Government to obtain such guar
antees as will insure the future protec
tion of the native converts r^ Mrt
Reports received by the State Depart
ment indicate that the native Christians
in four provinces in the south of cnina
subject to the operations of Boxers have
been exterminated, and this is known to
be true of converts at Paoting ru.
The decision of the President to pro
tect converts and ttje intenjion of the
United States not to open negotiations
with Li Hung Chang until he gives proof
of his willingness and ability to protect
life and property and to preserve order
In the province of Chi Li make it certain
that the Immediate withdrawal of Ameri
can troops is not contemplated.
In the meantime Li Hung Chang is on
his way to Peking. It is expected by
Minister \Yu Ting Fang that he will reach
Tientsin Tuesday, and a few days later
he will reach the capital, where he will
confer with Prince Ching. It Is not un
derstood, however, that this or any other
CJoverriment is ready to treat with him.
When the Imperial Government has re-
Stored order the United States will give
consideration to the character of the
Chinese Peace Commission. This state
ment is made with positlveness. No
Chinaman will be occepted as a peace
negotiator who took part in the attack
on foreign legations. It is therefore
highly improbable that the President will
accept Yung Lu as a member of the com
mission.

rapidly pushing through into Manchuria,
where all Indications point to extensive
operations before the arrival of winter.
They have suspended work on. the rail
road to Peking, which adds to the com
plications. It is believed that their ob

to consent to the destruction of Peking-.
The Tuliu expedition has returned . to

and it is reported that the Boxers have
retired in force to a village thirty miles
up the grand canal. "^
The Tuliu expedition has returned to
the burning and looting of Tuliu and this

of strengthening the line of communica

Chinese officials estimate that 20,000 dis

one jumped into such great popularity as
the new Bishop has attained in his brief
residence on the Pacific Coast. Both
clergy and laity of this conference de
clare he Is the man so long needed In
California to straighten out the tangles
and troubles of Methodist work in this
State, as only a man of powerful men
tality such as his can do.
In the midst, of the many services of
to-day, or rather, between them, consid
erable gossip relative to tho ministerial
appointments has flown about. Among
the prominent pastors whose places will
probably remain unchanged are Dr.
Dille of the First Church, Oakland; I>r.
Kummer of the First Church, San Jose;
Drs. Hutsinpiller, Bane, Beard and Ste
phens of San Francisco, Dr. Gray of Pa
cific Grovo and Dr. Lee of Modesto. Dr.
J. D. Hammond, recently agent of the
Methodist Book Concern, who was de
posed by the last General Conference,
will probably be put into one of the pre
siding elderships and Dr. Mathews, re
cently editor of the Pacific Christian Ad
vocate, is transferred to the Southern
California Conference.
The most notable events of to-day were
the annual conference sermon, delivered
by the Bishop, and the ordination of dea
cons and elders and the consecration of
deaconesses. The following persons re
ceived orders at the hands of the Bishop:
Deaconsâ Paul M. Spencer, Robert J.
Trevarrow, C. A. Richardson,- J. C. Hol
ster, David Ralston, T. Morimoto, Yoshi
Suke Sacon, Gue Kwai, Chan Lok ShanK,
John F. Burchim. Eldersâ Edward H.
Mackay, Morizo Yoshida, Winfleld S.
Kelly, Fay Donaldson, Charles F. With
row. In the afternoon the impressive rite
of consecrating the deaconesses was per
formed, the following receiving consecra
tion: Misses Neighbor, Bieghle, Warren,
Lamb, Cheney. Haeberlin and Jackson
and Mrs. Mclsaac and Mrs. Lincoln.
The Bishop's sermon was delivered at
10:20 a. m.. and long before the appointed
hour the house was packed with eagor
listeners. It is estimated that fully 2000
persons were present during the services.
The text of tl*e sermon was Matt. ii:25,
"All things are delivered unto me of my
father." The Bishop spoke of the sov
ereignty of the son of man, his authority
and dominfon existing throughout the
world now and constantly growing, not
the personal reign of a temuoral kins,
but a final and all-persuasive, power and
the influence of his teachings and spirit
as exemplified in the present rupremuey
of Christian civilization, commerce and
character. This, said he, is the ultimate
outcome of human history, for thero can
be no other. After the ordination cere
monies this afternoon a memorial service
for the members of the conference who
have died since the last annual session
was held, Rev. Dr. A. T. Needham being
in charge and memorial addresses being
delivered by Dr. \V. C. Gray, Dr. George

Weekly Call,$1.00 per YearProtests may be filed at the Merchants' Exchange up to
6 p. m. to-day, at which hour the repatta committee will
meet to consider v them, and also to take the evidence of the
skippers of the sloops Presto and Amlgo, the former boat
having apparentbJcommitted a breach of the recognized rules
of the road m forcing the latter to luff when she was on
the starboard tack and had the right of way over the former.
Qwing to this circumstance the Macdonough Cup and the first
prize pennant in the thirty-foot class still remain unrewarded.
Should the investigation show that the Presto committed a
breach of the rules sne must be disqualified, and the Mac
donough Cup will in that case go to the bpat which finished
second. The full results are shown in the table:

sentatives were accommodated on the tup Relief, which was

RIFLE AND PISTOL SHOOT
Giant Street Pageant in Which Richly
Caparisoned Animals Will Be
a Feature.
"Don't miss the Rlngllngs' circus pa
rade next Wednesday," says Colonel
Brady, the genial representative of that
aggregation of sawdust talent, and adds
that In all probability this injunction is
needles?. Few people miss a 'circus pa
rade, unless they are bedridden or so
soured by the misfortunes of life that the
smiles of the world are a saddening re
flection. Here is where you see the really
fine horse, sleek and well groomed, and
stepping with a pride of beauty that
makes one think of an American bud who
has landed a foreign title of the purplest
purple tinge. Obviously, the men who
groom these horses "remember the
mane."
Even the elophants. ponderous animals
that they are. with beginnings and end-
Ings that almost shut out the sun. movÂ«
along with an airy Independence that
makes you think of a politician at a pic
nic. They evidently do not need any di
gestive, stimulant, for they are so ag
gressively round and lazily healthy that
the moral of their presence. If it has any
relation to diet, must make you think
that Dickens' fat h^y was a much-abused
figure of storied speech.
Then there are the camels, with thplr
characteristic hump covered like a throne;
the equestriennes, mounted up on well
bred Kentucky horses and gayly-earbed:
the ear-racking clown band, a half-dozen
other brass bands, one of them on horse
hack, but in more musical accord, and the
little, tableau cars that picture for the lit
tle folks well-known fairy characters. To
make the strange sounds complete, which
run from the noises of the wild beasts to
the musical concord of a handsomely uni
formed band. oh|mes of church bells are
rung at intervals and the steam caliope
Is screechingly busy. All in all. a circus
parade of the Rlngllng Brothers' show is
something fiot to be missed.

THE fifth annual regatta of the Pacific- Interclub Yacht
Association was retailed yesterday without mishap. The
preparatory signal was given at noon, and ten minutes
Inter the twenty-live footers and yawls were sent across
the starting line. In the twenty-live foot class there were four
starters, the sloops Cupid, May, Merope and Phoenicia, all of
the Corinthian Yacht Club. Commodore Hawks' May won by
a very narrow marcrin, ' Merope being second. Four yawls
started, and one of these, the Spray, did not finish. The
Gypsie of the California Yacht Club won by twenty-two sec
onds, corrected time, the Arcturus of the Corinthian Yacht
Club being second. The Nereid finished one hour later than
the two leader?. The greatest Interest centered in the thirty
foot class, the Macdonough Cup being the first prize in that
class. The race would have been even more interesting than
it was had C. Chapman's Gadden and Commodore J. W. Pew's
Truant taken part. Frank Stone's Presto, sailed by her owner,
beat her nearest rival, Wcsterfeld and Morrow's Aeolus, which
has already won three Macdonough cups, by the ample margin
of eighteen minutes thirty seconds corrected time. Part" of
this large gain v.as attributed to the fact that Frank Stone,
instead of working close in along the Presidio shore, stood
well over to the Marin -ide, to take advantage of the last of
the ebb tide running there, while his rivals were already buck
ing a flood. Aeolus finished second and Amigo nearly nine
minutes later, corrected time.
In the thiriy-six foot class there were four starters, the
sloops Edna, Harpoon and Queen of the Corinthian Yacht
Club nnd the sloop Thetis of the Sun Franciscos, The two
last named did not finish, and the Harpoon beat the Edna
more than sixteen minutes, corrected time. In the forty-four
foot class, starting at 12:40 p. m., four crossed the line, but
the Rover and the Neptune did not finish. . E. Donohoe's
Speedwell took first place, beating A. J. Young'.s Clara by
nearly fifteen minutes, corrected time.
In the seventy-foot class 1. Gutte's schooner Chispa wa.s
the only starter and covered the middle course, reckoned at
fourteen nautical miles, in two hours thirty-eight minutes
twenty-four seconds actual time, or not quite twelve minutes
better than the Presto. The schooners Lurllne and Ramona
nnd the yawl Tramontana had entered in this class, hut, much
to the regret of the spectators, who seldom have a chance
of seeing big boats racing, did not start.
'The twenty-five footers and yawls sailed over the short
course from the starting line to the stakeboat off Pacific
Shoal, thence to Blossom Rock buoy, thence to leeward stake
boat and hack to starting line. The yachts of the thirty
foot, thirty-six foot and forty-four foot classes, and the
schooner Chispa sailed the middle course, which included
another beat out to windward and a run home. The early
part of the race was sailed on slack water, but by far the
greater part of it on a flood tide. There was a nice, steady
sailing breeze, but not enough for the heavy weather boats.
As the tide was with the wind, there was very little sea.

Frisco let loose on Borchers at tno very
outset. The "Chief" pitched so well dur
ine the morning frame on tho Oakland
grounds that he wjis put on the slab dur
ing the aftfrnoon. Five of the local swat
ters crossed the rubber on as many hits.
Fireworks vrerÂ« cheap and the Manxmen
were turning them out in <iuick fashion.
When the boy at the bell began working
the crowd stamped off five times once
each for Brorkhoff, Hlldebrand, Pabst,
Sullivan and Levy.
All this torrid, contentious atmosphere
blew around the Ilt-creation prounds yes
teraay afternoon duriifc the early part of
tne pame. it set the pace for the entire
day, which was kr-pt noisy and crackling
by the crowd, divided into sides, the
teams and tin? umpire In the mid He. I^ater
on Fuillvan thought h<"- put Uorehers out
at the plate. Tempering valor with dis
cretion "Sully" choked his wrath and to'.d
his troubles to the back-stop only, thus
pavinrr ixMnpr Jined. The crowd In the
stands did the rest.
Hutchinson sneered in belittling fash
ion at the arbiter and got off with a five
spot. So the league Is richer by J25, and
Hughey Smith has made himself solid
with his employers.
"Get an eye wash." snarled Pabst.
"Five dollars fur you," replied the um
pire, suavely. Then Pabst told Smith he
would hate to tell him what he thought
â¢of him, and, strange to say, immediately
did so.
"Ten dollars," was the umpire's satis
faction. â¢
Ssn Francisco 9, Oakland 6.
Afternoon Game Was Won by San
Fraaciscos, Who Found No
Difficulty in Hitting
Pitcher Borchers.
"Get back to your bases," said Umplr*-
HupliÂ«?y Smith x-> Krancks, Pabst and
Hutchinson.
"Clean your windows," said Francks.
"Five dollars," said Smith.
Then Francks called the umpire some
thing harsh and rasping.
"Ten dollars," shouted Smith. Francks
walked away.

The Ingleside Coursing Association took
a turn at the game yesterday at San

with O'Shea Bros." Young America as
runner up. The hares were strong and as
a result many long courses were run. V.

dog Ihe hounds were slipped to the
liveliest kind of a hare and were given
work enough for half a dozen dogs. Gar-.
rison did it all, though, and beat his op-
Ponfnt pointless, scoring 20 himself. A
relief Wog was slipped, but the Snapper
showed speed over him and beat him to
the escape. lie was called on a few min
utes later to go against Erin, and, though
he responded, hti was too far gone to
make a showing. Thirteen short ends at
fair odds gave the pikers some Joy.
The days results, with Judge Jofcn
Grace's official scores, follow:
M. Dunlea'a Erin had a pond chance
for first honors in the open stake yester
day at Union I*ark in the deciding course
against Royal Union, but â¢ luck was
apainst him. With an even score and
nothing to choose between the fast
hounds. Knn took a header and fell back
a peg. Before he had fairly join, <1 in the

Union was seven points to the go <1.
The running of the hares was up to
the recent strong standard, and mu:,y of
the hounds were withdrawn on ac Â¦.â¢<"> an t
of the grueling work given them b the
Merced pests.
Annie Hail for a youngster did Â¦ me
great coursing and responded cutely
after going a hard route. She went out
to the winner in the sixth round.
Snapper Garrison looked like a winner
up to the tifth round, and until Uten
showed all kinds of speed. In this roun.t
he was drawn for a natural bye and

Why has fruit growing been so much
neglected in Ireland? The climate and soil
are," aa a rule, Â¦well adapted for fruit cul
ture, but it seems to have died away In
stead of having progressed. Attached to
many of the old mansions and farm
houses all over the country may be seen
the remains of 'what were at one time
fine orchards, now scraggy, moss-grown
tree?, yielding a dozen or so of little, hard
wooden crabs. The Irish Board of Agri
culture is going to take, this matter up
energetically. â Chicago Chronicle. >

Congregation of First Baptist Church
Observed the Occasion "With
Song and Prayer. *
The First Baptist Church of this city
celebrated its fifty-first anniversary yes
terday with song and Tayer. In the
morning Dev. E. A. Woods, pastor
â¢of the church, preached the anniversary
sermon, in which he outlined the history
of the church and the events which have
taken place during the past year. In part
he said:
"The disciples were utterly disheartened
at Christ's death. But his resurrection re
assured them and his ascension filled
them with new courage, for they felt that
he was to be with them always as he had
promised. Thus they wen*, forth on their
mission and 'the Lord walked with them.'
His presence has been the center and
source of power In Christianity during
all the ages, and this is true to-day."
During the year fifty persons have been
received into the church. The following
have been called away by death: Mrs
M. L. Latreau, Samuel B. Thompson, Mra
H. K. Mitchell, Mrs. George Davis. Mrs!
M. S. Jones, Robert i'. Evans, Mrs. A.
Voy.

penses during the year J5016; for benevo
lence. $1412; paid on church debt, $2000
making a total of $8423.
The insurance on the former building
enabled the trustees to pay the old in

church with no debt upon tt.
CELEBRATED FIFTY
FIRST ANNIVERSARY
OAKLAND. Sept. IS.â Whether the ac
tion of Principal J. B. McChesney of the
Oakland High School in suspending the
six Merry Sorority maids who disobeyed
orders and bade farewell to their depart
ing sister. Miss" Mabel AVilcox. will be re
viewed by the Board of Education is the
newest phase of the jolly row which has
been worked up In the school.
The half dozen young ladles. Miss Grace
Davis, Miss Verlna Morrow, Miss Marian
Morro#, Miss Alice Lawes, Miss Pansy
Perkins and Miss Edna Orr. who are
under -the ban, are mute upon the sub
ject. They realize that they must have
been guilty of some enormous crimeâ
for was not the punishment too dreadful
thirty days' suspension for each one of
these pretty but defiant culprits?
Superintendent of Schools McClymonds
withdraws into a shell of deepest silence
when he is approached upon the subject.
"It is no concern of mine," auoth he.
"Mr. McChesney Is principal of the Oak
land High School and its discipline is in
his charge." i
Principal McChesney has been enjoying
a few days' respite from the annoyances
of applicants for favors at his hands. He
returned late this evening from his sum
mer home at Mill Valley.
"Was not the punishment too severe?"
was the query put to him on his return.
"I do not care to discuss the matter,"
replied McChesney. "It has been ex
ploited enough. . 1 have nothing to ex
plain. The six girls were suspended as a
matter of discipline. Those who do not
obey the orders of their superiors are
always punished and that is simply what
happened In this case.
"I do not propose to go Into the details
of the affair, but will state that there
must be discipline in the Oakland High
School as long as I am r.t its head. Those
who do not obey orders must take the
consequences."
SIX PRETTY MAIDS ARE
NOT DOING ANY TALKING
The funeral will take place Tuesday af
ternoon at 1:30 o'clock from Odd Fellows'
Hall under the auspices . of University
Lodge.
Mr. Hickox held many offices within the
order. In 1M31 he was grand representa
tive from this State to the tirand Lodge
which met in the East. Deceased was
born In Medina, Ohio, February. 20. 1820.
When a youth he made his way to Michi
gan and later to Wisconsin. On April 1,
lh50. In company with a party of adven
turesome young men, he started across
the plains to try his fortune in the Golden
West. He arrived in California in Sep
tember of the sjime year and located at
Downievllle, Sierra County. He was suc
cessful and remained there until 1871. He
leaves a wife, but no children.
Hickox was an Odd Fellow for fifty
three years. He became a member of the
order in 1847 when he joined Friendship
Lodge. The lodge was a. small one com
posed of a few men in the wilds of Wis
consin who had banded together for fra
ternity's sake. Down to the day of his
death thÂ« old man was an ardent believer
In the principles of Odd Fellowship. The
only lodge he ever belonged to in Cali
fornia was University Lodge No. 114 of
this city, of which he was a member at
the time of his death.
John Henry Hickox. the oldest Odd Fel
low In California, died last night at his
home in this city after an illness of five
months. He was stricken with paralysis
on March 23 and since that time had been
confined to his bed.

DIES AT THE
AGE OF EIGHTY
THE BELLS," Leopold Lewis' adapta
tion of one of the Erckmann-Chat
rlan psychological romances, will be
put on at the Columbia Theater this
evening by the Clay Cleme,nt-L. R.
Stockwell company. The role of Matthias,
so famous in the Henry Irving repertoire,
will be assumed by Mr. Clement, and the
clever actor will undoubtedly do full
justice to the difficult character of the
bell-haunted innkeeper.
"Napoleon's Guard," the powerful one
act drama by Dion Bouclcault, will fill
In the remainder of the .evening, and next
week "The Magistrate" will be pre
sented. , . â¢
The week's bill at the Tlvoli Opera
house will be the old favorte "Faust,"
and another Verdiâ "Trovatore."
The interest of this "Faust" presenta
tion consists largely in the appearance of
Slgnor Nicollnl as Mephisto, he being the
only one among the present company of
singers at the Tivoli who has not yet
been fairly "tried out." It is said to be
S!gnor Nlcollni's best role, and if the
promise of his performances up to date
be at all fulfilled the Mephisto part will
receive a thoroughly satisfactory render
ing in the hands of Signor Nicolini.
The favorite, Salassa, who la again in
excellent form, will sing Valentine; Bar
ron Berthold will appear as Faust, and is
therein most sympathetically suited;
Anna Llchter has a favorite part in Mar
guerite; Frances Graham, winning many
laurels this season, will doubtless win
more as Siebel.
In "Trovatore the cast is equally good.
Those who remember the Leonora of Ettie
Stewart will again welcome this clever

to prevent a tragedy. Another recent oc
currence was the boy's attempt to choke
a child to death with mud.
: "We have thougnt." said Mrs. Knox.
"Harry might improve, but matters have

"After exhausting every kind of medi
cal treatment we applied to Dr. Clark,
knowing he had been successful in many

"His demeanor toward his brothers and
sisters was inhuman. One day he slashed
his eldest sister across the face with a
penknife. He was then S years old. She
carries the scar now.
"Before the accident Harry was a par
ticularly bright boy. He walked and
talked at an unusually early age. After
the injury I noticed a marked change in
him mentally. He did not seem, to have
the same control over himself. He be
came cruelly vindictive, and early devel
oped a mania for taking anything that
did not belong to him â a kleptomania be
yond question. He delighted to kill ani
mals and to torture them.
Mrs. Knox said
"We found some pressure on the
brain, which has been removed. The boy
has suffered no Immediate bad effects
from the operation, and 1 feel that good
will be accomplished, although some
time musj elapse before a final opinion
can be given."
The parents of the boy are waiting anx
iously for the result.

this extraordinary case Is much more dif
ficult of explanation, but It was in the
hope that relief of the brain would change
the current of the psychological move

I have reason to believe that If this boy's

the operation will be a success in its re

ofSerrs who were endeavoring to arrest
him for the brutal murder of acred James
McFarland, William Miller turned his
revolver on himself and fired his last
ballet into his head in a final attempt to
cheat the law. As Patrick Coughlin. a
farmer Liverraore watchman, and Deputy
Sheriff George' Taylor closed in on him
with <irawn pistols, ready to shoot at the
tflXbtast move. Miller, realizing that all
was up aÂ« far as liberty was concerned,
f placed the muzzle of his revolver to the
â¢-:<2e of his head above his right ear and
pu'.led the tripper. A* he fell to the
K-iund, just out of sight. In the brush,

forward, thinking he had fired at them.

YOUNG MORAL DEGENRATE
WHO UNDERWENT THE
OPERATION.
"While It is a little early to begin to
say what may result from this operation,
it is undoubtedly a most extraordinary
case, the first of its kind of which 1 have
ever heard in this city. The boy was not
only a thoroughly developed ; klepto
maniac, but was lost to all moral sense.
The theory is that the fracture of the
skull from the ax's blow caused a depres
sion of the bone and a pressure upon the
brain which has caused a tissue degen
eration.
"Of course the psychological aspect of
A scar on the hairline, above the right
eye, marked where the ax had inflicted
injury. Dr. Clark decided to -trephine the
skull. This was done a day of two ago
by the superintendent, assisted by Dr.
Lillle, Dr. McVeigh and Dr. Frank St.
Sure. Of the conditions Superintendent
Clark said to-day:
Last Tuesday the boy was sent to Su
perintendent Clark at the County Hos
pital. The case was investigated. It
was decided that there might be a serious
pressure upon some brain tract, which
would account for the remarkable mental
characteristics of the child.
Having exhausted every resource at
their command, the parents turned with
their psychological problem to the sur
geon's knife.
As he grew older the conditions became
more and more unbearable. His sisters
were not safe from injury and numer
ous instances of his murderous tenden
cies are recited by the grief-stricke.i
parents. Nothing movable within his
reach and strength to remove escaped the
boy. He was a kleptomaniac, say the
doctors, beyond any doubt, for he would
steal and hide his plunder, generally
smashing It into worthlessness.
All of this change came almost lmme
diately after the injury to his head. Bo
fore that, the testimony of his parents Is,
that their boy was unusually bright and
quick-witted.
Ever since an accident several year3
ago, when the lad was struck on the head
by an nx falling from a building, the con
stantly Increasing evidences of his strange
lapses and extraordinary conduct nave

The officers say that Miller evidently
intended taking to the hills back of
Pleasanton. where in the tangled under
brush of the wild and unfrequented
canyons he might have eluded pursuit in
definitely. Once secreted, he could have
awaited an opportunity to make his es
rape to San Kranoisco and ship to sea.
The fact -that he returned for provisions
Is cited as evidence that Milier intended
to make some such move. McFarland's
lÂ»Â«Jy has not yet been claimed by any
one. Th*Â» Coroner' has not set the time
for the inquest.
After Miller's wounds were dresed tem
porarily he was removed to the County
Jail at Oakland. There Dr. R. O. Bald
win attended him. Dr. Baldwin says
Miller will recover. The man suffers a
grpat deal of pain and refuses to further
discuss the shooting of McFarland or the
duel in the dark with the officers last
night.
Deputy Sheriff George Taylor, who took
a hand in the capture of the murderer,
says Miller wm surprised by Patrick
Coughlin and that the firing at once com
menced. Others of the posse were at
tracted at once to the scene, and when
they found Miller with the bullet in his
head they thought that It was from one
of their pistols. Taylor says Miller put
up a fierce fight while his ammunition
held out and that Coughlin, though a man
over 60 years of age, held the murderer at
bay until help arrived. The old man
stood up ami exchanged shot for shot
with the desperate criminal.
"We sighted each other at the same

both commenced to fire. We stood up and

BOY BURGLAR
CAUGHT WITH
HIS PLUNDER
Even as late as 1SSO the Democrats had
not arrived at a clear apprehension of
their duty as a party In respect to criti
cism of the tariff from thp standpoint of
the taxpayer. The party platform of that
year did indeed contain the traditional
words favoring â¢' "a tariff for revenue
only." but there Is no i-vldence that they
â¢were meant to set forth a serious party
conviction. The camoalfjn was proceeding
upon other issues. Democrats were ar
raigning Republicans for accumulated
party sins, and Republicans were de
pending chiefly upon a sentimental pre
sentation of thÂ«Â» "bloodv shirt" issue when
the State election in Mi'Ine occurred with
a defeat for the Republ'cans by such ma
jorities as created serious alarm. Then
there was a sudden change in the typa
of campaign oratory. Republicans all at
once sprung the tariff question upon their
opponents. The Democrats were arraign
ed as being privy to a damnable plot to
The Tariff a Leading Issue.
If the Democrats came Into control of
the Government In 1SS4 without standing
for any clearly defined party Issue under
the leadership of Cleveland, they were
rot long in finding such an issue. The
traditional Democratic policy was that
of steady, consistent opposition to a high
protective tariff. The Republicans had
favored a protective tariff, as had the
AVhigs before them. As incident to the
taxation system of the civil war a very
high protective tariff had been fastened
upon the country. A system of internal
revenue had been created which taxed do
mestic producers heavily, and by way of
compensation the duties on Imported
goods were made correspondingly high.
After the close of the war the taxes were
removed from one after another of the
domestic products, while the customs du
ties remained. Added to this, many of
the duties upon Imported goods were spe
cific â so many cents a yard or a pound.
As prices declined upon the return Jko
specie payments specific duties became
proportionately higher. Had It not been
for the many other pressing questions the
Democrats would undoubtedly have
promptly made a ; serious attack
upon the war tariff of the Re
publican party. But ; the reconstruc
tion of the Southern States, negro
suffraef, military rule In the South, the
refunding of Government bonds, the re
turn to specie payments, the scandals of
official dishonestyâ all these problems
loft little time for either Republicans or
Democrats to devote to the details of a
tariff system.
For twenty-four years the Democrats
had been excluded from power and their
reinstatement was due to the action of
a dissatisfied faction in the opposing
party. A change of 600 votes In the single
State of New York from Cleveland to
Blainp would have given the Presidency
to Blalne and kept the Republicans in
office for another term. And many thou
sands of New York Republicans were
known to have voted for Cfeveland.
As party issues were not made promi
nent and party lines were not drawn with
precision, the election turned largely
upon the personal records of the can
didates. The final result was for some
days in doubt. The South was still solid
ly Democratic: all the Northern States,
except Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey
and New York went Republican, and New
York was claimed by both parties. Upon
the count trf that State the decision turn
ed and the corrected final returns gave
to .'the country once more a Democratic
President.
The issues growing out of the war had
passed from the field of practical politics,
and parties hnd not yet divided sharp
ly upon new and clearly defined issues.
Hence it happened that the campaign of
1SS4 was guided by personal considera
tions rather than by opposing view3 of
great public questions.
Grover Cleveland, the Democratic can
didate, had first achieved political prom
inence as a reforming Sheriff of Buffalo,
X Y and in 1882 had been made Gov
ernor of his State by an overwhelming
majority. His conduct of State affairs
won him the especial favor of the inde
pendent Republicans, who were beginning
to be called "Mugwumps."
The same class of Republicans had
made use of the great popularity of
James Q. IMaine In 1ST. 6 and again in 1SS0
to break the force of the "stalwart" fac
tion which was devoted to the candidacy
of Grant. But before the same magnetic
statesman came for the third time before
a Republican convention as a candidate
for the Presidential nomination he had
come to personate in the eyes of the in
dependent Republicans all that was cor
rupt and dangerous in American politics.
In spite of their opposition Blalne re
ceived the nomination, and his candidacy
was immediately and openly repudiated
by a large proportion of the Republican
press and by many prominent individuals.
The Republican defection greatly in
fluenced the action of the Democrats,
whose convention met a few days later.
It may be said that their nomination wss
practically dictated by the Rt publican
bolters. Cleveland -was their choice and
also the choice of a large majority of the
New York delegation, although he had
strong opositlon from Tammany Hall.
The Personal Campaign of 1884.
Party dissensions' persisted throughout
Arthur's term of office. Kvents strength
ened the reform element and enabled it
to carry through Congress the civil service
reform bill. Tariff reform was also
brought forward for discussion. The war
tariff was for the most part still In force.
"With the return of prosperity after re
sumption of specie payments, and the re
vival of business, the great increase of na
tional revenue from customs poured into
the treasury an average surplus of $100,
000.000 per annum. The situation com
pelled public attention and tariff revision
was Been to be imperative. A tariff com
mission was appointed in 1SS2 to recom
mend legislation, and the following year
an act inaugurating very moderate tariff
reform was passed. These tariff measures
did not. however, involve the arraying of
one party against the other, nor the tri
umph of one faction In the Republican
party over another. Party distinctions
were geatly obscured. In each party ex
isted a strong independent element not
subservient to the party whip, and at the
same time a multitude of intelligent voters
had ceased to class themselves as mem
bers of either party.
Arthur's Administration.
During and after the war there grew up
a new system of party organization and
management, designated as the "boss sys
tem" or "machine politics." The party
gradually ceased to be the organized rep
resentative of all its members, aiid became
the representative of only a distinct in
ner circle of party members wno were in
close alliance with utticial patronage and
with financial interests wnich depended
upon political action. This inner circle,
called "the machine," controlled to a large
extent the whole organization, and man
aged party affairs for the benefit of the
members of the machine In selfish con
spiracy against the interests of the body
of the party and the general public. Op
position within the party therefore took
the form of criticism of speckle abuses
and a demand for reform of the civil ser
vice. It was this opposition which came
near electing the Democratic candidate in
1876. which resisted the third term for
Grant in 1SS0 and elected Cleveland in 1SS4.
The formation and consolidation of a
distinct reform element in the party took
place later, as a result of the exposure of
a series of outrageous scandals involving
in some cases persons of high official rank
and of long and honorable political ca
reers. Mention has already been made of
the most ftunous of these â the Credit Mo
bilier transaction, the whisky ring frauds,
tho salary grab, the star route pecula
tions. For these and other delinquencies
the party in power was held responsible
and was severely arraigned, not by its
political opponents only, but by many of
its own adherents.
Immediately upon the close of the war
tendencies appeared for certain sections of
the Republican party to act at times with
the Democrats. Strict loyalty to party
ties did not prevail. So strong had this
disintegrating tendency kcome by 1872
that in the Presidential campaign of that
year we have seen the National Demo
cratic party accepting the candidates nom
inated by the disaffected Republicans.
GROWING DIVISION IN THE REPUB
LICAN PARTY.
AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
force upon the unsuspecting American
people the diabolical policy of absoluto
free trade, which would result In tha
wholesale destruction of American Indus
trie*, the pauperization oÂ£ American la
bor, with innumerable other frightful ills.
The Democrats were wholly unprepareil
for such a change of front on the part of
their enemy. There wan hesitation, di
vided counsels, and their candidate. Gen
eral Hancock, added to thÂ« confusion by
cabalistic remarks* which set the country
laughing. Out of this unpremeditated con
founding of the Democrats it appeared
that the Republicans made wains. Never
theless, as has been me-ntionM. they came
during Arthurs administration to recog
nize and admit the need of reforming tho
tariff.
When Cleveland Â«ntÂ«red upon his ad
mlnistrrrtive duties the taxes upon imports
were still furnlshinsr a considerable Â«ur
plus of revenue, and the new President set
himself earnestly to -work to secure the
necessary reduction of duties. To the
country at large tha subject was present
ed as a party issue. Opposition there was
to the Presidents policy from Democratic
members of Congress, but the party as a
w hole Indorsed it. It was attacked by
Republican politicians, who strenuously
defended the policy of protection against
the alleged destructive designs of the
Anglaclzed free traders.
Though the Democrats failed to secure
legislation of any kind upon the tariff dur
ing Cleveland's first term, they did suc
ceed in making the tariff question for the
time the leading political issue, a,nd very
distinctly a party Issue. The element of
opposition within the party to the reforms
urged by President Cleveland grew weak
er as the discussion was continued. The
President's message of 1?S7 was wholly
devoted to a consideration of tariff ques
tions, and during the session of Congress
which followed two elaborate bills for re
form were brought forward. That sup
ported by the Senate was drawn by Re
publican?, and proposed alterations in the
existing tariff which would strengthen Its
protective features. The Krtuse bUJ. on
the other hand, was a Democratic moiia
ure. and was passed in the House by a
strictly party vote â only four Democrats
voting against it. It provided for sharp
reductions in the duties, more particularly
upon raw materials.
These two bills exactly defined ths posi
tions of the two parties, and the-y were
made the basis of th# discussions of the
Presidential campaign of l.W. and upon
the two oppoÂ«inr policies respecting the
tariff that battle was foujrht.

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
The German transport Samoa will frc
ready to sail for China on Saturday at
noon. She is to take. 800 horses to Taku
for the German Government.
The battleship Wisconsin will have her
trial trip on the bay to-day.
Reinsurance on the American ship Wa
chusett has advanced to 65 per cent. The
vessel is now out 126 days from Newcas
tle, Aus. for Kahulul and fears are en
tertained for her safety. W. E. Miphell.
her managing owner, has no such fears,
however, and is taking a chance in the re-
Insurance business himself. :
The Puget Sound steamer Walla "Walla
will not reach port until this afternoon.
A case of smallpox was developed between
here and Victoria. B. C and the vessel
was quarantined there. She was released
last week and it was expected that she
would reach here yesterday. She could
not make up the lost time, however.
Chief Engineer J. S. Richards, late of
the Mineola, will go out as chief of the
Oceanic Company's Australia next
"Wednesday. Chief Kngineer Keller of the
Zealandia, who made one trip on the Aus
tralia, goes back to his own vessel.
"Water/ Front Notes.
The schooner Louise J. Kenney got in
from Bering Sea last night. She left Point
Hope forty-seven days ago, and at that
time the whalers were just preparing to
enter the ice. The Indians who went home
on the schooner were delighted to get
back into the frozen North, but all ex
pressed a wish to make another trip to
San Francisco "some other time." All
hands on the whaling fleet were well. The
Kenney brings home 1400 pounds of bone
as the result of her trading cruise. On the
way, down stops were made at_ Cape York
and Cape Nome, but no news or interest
that has not been published was gathered.
Arrives From Point Hope.
It is only ten days since the United
States transport Thomas came into port,
but in that time new hawse pipes weigh
ing five tons each have been put in. The
work was 'done under the supervision of
William Donald,, assistant Marine Super
intendent of the Union Iron 1 Works, and
it is owing to his executive ability that
the work was done in such a short time
and in such an able manner. The Thomas
is now carrying patent bald anchors and
to accommodate them the big hawse
pipes were required. There will now be
no such a thing as catting an anchor on
the Thomas, as the shank will follow the
chain in through the hawse pipe and that
will end the job.
Quick Work on the Thomas.
All the shags and sea fowl that used to
congregate oh Shag and Arch rocks have
disappeared since the work of destruction
began, and seafaring men are now won
dering what new abode they have found.
In another week or so Arch Rock will
be no more. The preparations for the de
struction of this "menace to navigation"
have already begun. The staging from
which the rock will be bored in all di
rections has already been erected, and
probably to-day or to-morroy the work
of drilling will begin.
The people who travel to and from Sau
sallto in the ferry-boats, object to the
removal of Arch Rock. They sav it is
one of the most artistic spots in the bay,
and, owing to the history attached to it,
the Government should preserve it and
place a beacon light there. A number of
sailing vessels came to grief on the rock
and two of the pilot boats ran it down in
a fog and were' lost. Three men in a
boat tried years ago to pull through trâ¬
arch, but the swell that comes in through
the Golden Gate caught the boat and
crushed it against the crown of the arch.
Still the rock is picturesque and one of
the landmarks of the bay. and every pas
senger who comes and goes on the faau
salito and Tiburon ferries is sorry to se^j
the preparations that are being made for
blowing it up. ,
? The contractors are losing no time. It
was only la.st week that Shag Rock No. 2
was blown up. and now the work of get
ting ready to destroy Arch Rock is well
under way. Far more gelatine will be
used on this occasion than in either of
the former successful attempts and Arch
Rock is expected to provide one of the
finest sights ever seen in the Bay of San
Francisco when it is blown up.

'HGED Oscar Relnstein felt the
hand of death upon him yesterday
H morning, and In the early hours of
the afternoon his body lay upon
the operating table in the Receiving Hos
pital. Death came to him shortly after
2 o'clock, while he was seeking recreation
and pleasure. Mr. Relnstein. either
fell or jumped bacKward from
car BCS of the Ellis-street lino
at Stanyan and "Waller streets. He struck
heavily on the pavement, and within an
hour was dead. An examination at the
Receiving Hospital disclosed a slight
Â§calp wound, although no evidence of a
fracture of the skull was found.
Mr. Reinstein left his home, 90S Ellis
street, early in the afternoon. Intending
to enjoy an outing at the beach. As the
Ellis-street cars now run out to Ninth
avenue, where the change is made to the
beach cars, Mr. Relnstein was carried
past the old transfer point at Stanyan
and Haight streets. It is presumed that
he was of the opinion that he must change
at Stanyan and Haight streets, and. In
attempting to alight from the moving car,
fell and struck his head upon the pave
ment. This is only one theory, however,
and as there were no eye-witnesses so
far as is known, the manner and cause
of his death must remain unknown. The
car on which the deceased was riding,con
tinued on Its way after the accident, the
conductor and motorman apparently be
ing unaware of its occurrence.
"Old St. Mary's stands not only as the
solid sentinel of the imperishable faun
which has reared its walls, but also as a
livinc agent for all that which uplifts and
ennobles life, renewing its strength and
its beauty. It stands also as a monitor
against all that which degrades and de
praves men and women. Long suffering,
but not silent, it has witnessed for too
great a period the faults and crimes com
mitted beneath the very shadows of its
walls. But a brighter day dawns apace,
when In an atmosphere purified from
darkness and evil. In an environment more
suitable to its gracious and heavenly
work, it will radlte forth sweetness and
llpht and strength to all its happy wor
shipers."
"As we are bound to our fellowmen by
common 'nature and a. given destiny, so
should we be compassionate and helpful
to them under whatsoever burdens they
toil. And that the giving of such help is
a Christian and a most praiseworthy char
acteristic of tho American people, the
spontaneous aid of and the widefelt sym
pauiy towards the city of Galveston in
its calamitous visitation most amply
show. But such helpfulness to be consis
tent, abiding and meritorious requires the
supernatural grace of God. It is the prac
tical exercise of the great commandment
of the love of God toward those, who are
his images and creatures.
".V third application that I Â¦would make
to-day of this text, "Bear ye one another's
burdens,' is local and somewhat personal.
Rev. Father Wyman. who from the time
when the Taulist Fathers took charge
here has labored so zealously and who
has borne the double burden of the pas
toral charge and the local superlorship,
to-day, at his own urgent request, is per
mitted to lay them down. I hasten to. say
that Father "Wyman remains here, and
gladly so, to continue to work among you
and to assist the new incumbent by his
valuable counsel and experience. Let me
entreat you, beloved brethren, by your
kind co-operation and prayers to enable
all of us who are ministering to you to
carry on our work well, to fulfill the lav/
of Christ and to give n good account of
our stewardship.
"The meaning of this injunction is plain,
but our proiit from it must be in the
measure of our acceptance and In the ap
plication of it to our lives. The historical
s-'C-nse of these words was made manifest
that St. Paul exhorted the more instruct
ed and suitable members of the Church
of Balatia to be compassionate and help
ful to their weaker brethren, who had
again put themselves under the bondage
of the law; who had lapsed into doctrinal
error rather than into moral fault. No
form of interest in our brethren is more
commendable, even now.
Father Smith's text was taken from St.
Paul's Spistlo to the Galalians, "Bear ye
one anoiner's burdens and so you shall
lultill the law oi" Christ." In part he said:
A large <ionsreKation greeted Rev. Mich
ael Smith, C. S. P., Superior of the Faulist
Fathers on this Coast, when he entered
the pulpit of St. Mary's Church yesterday
morning to preach his initial sermon. The
distinguished member of the Missionary
Order won instant favor with his people
by his kindly ways and brilliant sermon.
The new Superior paid a high tribute
to Rev. Father H. II. Wyraan, whom he
superseded as pastor of the Paulist
Church, lie told how much the work of
Father Wyraan had been appreciated by
the superior general and what delight it
gave him to announce that he wa3 to
remain and labor among the people he
has learned to love and who have mani
fested such great affection for him.

Bertram Adams, the young man who
hncl his foot crushed between the draw
heads of two freight trains at Ocean View
on the 11th inst., died at the County Hos
pital yesterday. Adams was stealing a
ride on the southbound freight train to
San Jose when he received the injuries
which cost him his life. Blood poisoning
caused his death. The body was removed
to the Morgue.
Died From Kis Injuries.
ODD Fellows' Hall was crowded from
the stage to the front door yester
day afternoon with an audience of
soft-eyed senoritas and stalwart
senores of the Mexican colony, nearly 2000
of them, packed like sardines and crowd-
Ing Into aisles and perched in perilous po
sitions on the backs of chairs, craning
their necks and shouting themselves
hoarse with enthusiasmâ the same en
thusiasm that thrills Americans â¢ on the
Fourth of July. It was ninety years yes
terday since the cathedral bells in the
City of Mexico rang out the glad tidings
that Miguel Hidalgo had accomplished his
dreamâ that Spain's yok'o had been thrown
oft forever, and that Mexico Â¦ was free,
and so, like Benjamin Ide Wheeler, every
one in that great audience felt 'that it
was "good for htm to be there."
And then the programme â seventeen
numbers. Speeches, t songs, choruses
tunes orations, duets, quartets, and all
the rest of it. and the only English things
In It were Julius Kahn. orator of the day,
and Mayor Phelan, who failed to mater
ialize.
; Carmen F. Jimenez was the hero of the
day, tho luminary round which every
thing else revolved. When at the end of
a long speech in Spanish, burning with
patriotism and enthusiastic memories of
Hidalgo and those of his kind, who had
fought and bled that, no manana should
ever feel Spain's yoke grow heavier, Jim
enez shouted. "Vive la Libertad! Viva
Hidalgo! Viva Diaz!" A perfect hurri
cane of "Bravos" broke loose, making the
tricolored banner over the stage shake
and sway as if injected with tho general
enthusiasm.
And very pretty the stage looked, too,
The poem of the day was read by F.
Carranza. the sweet singer of the Mexi
can colony, and A. de la Torre read the
Mexican Declaration of Independence.
The festivities Incidental to the ninetieth
celebration of Mexican independence did
not cease with tho going down of yester
day's sun. Odd Fellowr/ Hall was again
crowded last night with a pleasure-seek
ing throng, which had come forth accord
ing to annual custom to participate In
what was to many- the most enjoyable
feature of the day, tho grand ball. The
hall was beautifully decorated in Mexican
and American colors. Prior' to the ball a
banquet was given by the most prominent
members of the Mexican colony.

The officers and committee of arrange
ments that had the affair in charge con
sisted of the following named:
"We of the United States are deeply in
terested and concerned In the welfare and
progress of Old Mexico. She is our sister
republic. You have sont to our country
men who have taught us to know you and
know you as you are.
"I feel convinced that Hidalgo drew
muemof his splendid inspiration from our
Â¦Washington, our Jefferson, our Adams.
Let me express the hope to the citizens ot
the two countries that the sister republics
of Mexico and the United States may con
tinue to lead all nations of the earth In
the greatest of all blessingsâ the bound
less blessings of liberty and independ
ence."
Julius Kahn's address was a fine trib
ute to Mexico's share in the development
of this State, r.nd to the memory of Mi
guel Hidalgo, whose name, -the orator
said, would live for all time. The speak
er's remarks were in part as follows:
"The student' of Â¦ history cannot but ad
mire the soul-consuming love of his coun
try, the burning spirit of patriotism that
animated Hidalgo and his noble, lofty
minded compatriots in their herioc strug
gle for liberty. Poorly armed, miserably
equipped, they yet took arms against the
legions of Spain, gladly, cheerfully offer
ing up their hearts' blood that their coun
try might bo free.
with seventy-five of the Mexican colony s
fairest grouped there, all smiling at the
audience, and the audience smiling back
at them, and A. K. Coney, Mexican Con
sul General and president of the day, in
the center. These same young ladies con
tributed one of the most, successful num
bers of the day, when; with Senorita An
drea Mojica's superb contralto to lead
them, they broke into the stirring strains
of the Mexican national hymn, and maybe
every one in the audience wasn't helping
them out.

Stanislaus Walewski Was at Stock
ton "When the Poor Woman
Committed Suicide.
Stanislaus Walewski, the husband of
Urqule Walewski, the unfortunate woman
who ended her life by sending a pistol
bullet through her heart on Saturday '
night, returned to the city yesterday
morning. He came home on the Stock
ton boat and proceeded to his home,
where he received a shock on- seeing a no
tice on the door signed by the Coroner's
deputy. The dazed man at once sought
pome of his friends, who told him what
had happened during his absence. He
went to the Morgue and wept over the
body of his late wife.

curred.

P. "VV. Riordan. who on that day cele
brated the anniversary of his consecration
as Archbishop. Congratulations poured
in on the distinguished prelate, and he was
the recipient of the well wishes of his
people, who devoutly prayed that His
Grace's health would permit him to per
form the important duties of his high
office for many more years.
Archbishop Riordan was indisposed
yesterday and was advised by his physi
cians and intimate friends to remain in
doors. Despite their wishes, he fulfilled
a promise made to the pastor and con
gregation of the Church of Corpus Chris
ti. by journeying to the Mission road and
confirming a large class of children and
older people. After administering the
rites of confirmation he called upon Rev.
B. C. Redahan. assistant pastor of Sts.
Peter and Paul, to speak for him. Father
li^dahan spoke in Italian and at the out
set of his short talk said he regretted
that the Archbishop because of indispo
sition could not in his vivid way deliver
the instructions he generally Impressed
on the occasion of confirmation.
Rev. Father Cassinl, pastor of the
church, was celebrant at the benediction
and Father Lrambert, O. F. M., acted as.
his assistant. The sponsors were Mrs.
Dr. Masuero and G. di Pauli. The Arch
bishop was attended by his secretary, tho
Rev. Father Mulligan. Among the clergy
present were Rev. Albert Miller, O. F. M..

iÂ«= reported that he has pone to Portland,
Or., and that he has shaken' the dust of
Fan Francisco from his feet forever.
Siemann was engaged by the court to
cpf'.ft in making the affair a success and
!r.cidenta!ly to act on the night of the
1p.1I ns ticket-seller In the box office. He
performed his duties with, as they say,
too much zeal, as he not only looked after
the money at the Pavilion, but at the
close of the evening's festivities took it
hrrne with him. The next day he was
eipectfd to call at the court headquarters
and turn over the money, but he failed to
materialize. Monday the court officers
thought he would be sure to come, but
they waited In vain. He was seen around
town as late as last Friday, and he then
left the city for Portland, taking with
Hm a Â«ridow by the name of Mrs. Beck
leg and her two children.
How much money he took with him is
* hard to decide, eo the Foresters say. but
thf-y claim that the affair mu?t have been
a financial raccesa. A t-alonnman on Ma-
The autopsy, held last night, developed
the fact that Mr. Reinsteln died of heart
disease. The .only Injuries he received
from the fall were some slight bruises and
lacerations of the face.
Herman Hogrefe. the motorman of the
car from which Mr. Reinsteln fell, sur
rendered himself to the police last night
and was charged with manslaughter. He
was at once released on cash bail. Hog
refe refused to make a statement until
he had consulted his attorney.
Mr. Relnstein was long and well known
throughout business circles of this city.
ITIb son, J. B. Reinsteln, Regent of the
University of California and senior mem
ber of the law firm of Relnstein & Eisner,
and his daughters, Mrs. Eisner, Mrs. C. I.
Shalnwald, Mrs. M. P. Wolf and Miss"
Reinsteln, survive him.
"Mr. Relnstein was past 76 years." she
said, "and was very deaf. For that rea
son he never left the house unless some
one accompanied him. He must have gone
out quietly to-day, for none of us heard
him. Ills words to me this morning were
prophetic. He was unusually despond
ent, and told me that he knew he did not
have long to live. Within a few hours he
was dead. His words of the morning were
true."
Officer E. H. Waterman was notified of
the accident, and rang for the patrol
wagon. The dying man was placed on a
stretcher, and the wagon made a fast
run. but arrived at the hospital too late.
The need of a hospital in the park was
again demonstrated, though it is doubt
ful that Immediate treatment would have
resulted favorably. Word was sent to the
late home of the deceased, and a young
woman employed as a domestic hurried
to the hospital.
Yesterday afternoon Xoriepa, with sev
eral other members of Court Stanford,
called on Chief or Police Sullivan and re
quested him 10 telegraph the Chief of Po
lice of Portland to arrest G. Siemann.
Chief Sullivan had a Ions consultation
with the committee and advised them to
swear out a warrant for Slemann's ar
rest. As the man was outside the State
he could do nothing until the warrant was
issued, he said.
To-day K. L. Xorlepa. a member of
Court Stanford, will swear out a warrant
for the arrest of Siemann in Judge Fritz's
court and attempt to hrin;: him back to
this city. Siemann resided at 503 Post
ptret*: and was there known as Mr. Beek
lcp.
son street, named Schroder, was also, so
he claims, victimized by Siemann. Schro
der ran the bar at the hall anil Siemann
handled the money. He made a half set
tlement with the saloonman; but Schro
der claims that there is still a big balance
duo him.
Siemann was a well-known figure
around town. He is an Australian by
birth and has the proud distinction of
having been the first manager of Peter
Jackson in this country. During later
years h*Â» drifted into politics. He worked
for some, tiine in the Assessor's oftice un
