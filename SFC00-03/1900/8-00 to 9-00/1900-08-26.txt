scription, j
or the East, but the acids used are made
on Ine premises, and the manufacture of
them constitutes by far the greater part
of the work In the preparation of the nl
tro-glyccrin.
Before the present form of Iron mixing
tenks came Into use large wooden tanks
lined with lead were used. At one of the
powder works which raa In early days
end has elncc gone the way of them
ell there was a large wooden tank lined
with eheet lead. A hole came in the lead
end the nltro-grlyeerln had begun to work
through and eoak Into the wood. The tank
t-sls worth a large amount of money, as
the sheet lead is half an inch thick. The
leadburner of the works was brought up
to look at the tank and the. situation ex
plained to him. He Jumped Into the tank
with his rubber-soled shoes, cautiously
pried up the lead .where it had split apart
and saw that the ; wood beneath xvas
thoroughly saturated with explosive oil.
In ordcrto repair the leak he would have
to press the lead lining firmly against the
dangerous wood, lay a patch of sheet lead
over the spot and then rub the edges with
an iron that had been heated until it was
hot enough to melt the lead.
The foreman stood on the top of a Btep
ladder and looked over at the leadburner.
The leadburner looked up at the foreman.

,Â¦ "All right, then; I will."
The leadburner started heatlng-his irons.
When they were hot and. with attendants
to pass them In to him, he got Into the
tank. Time, was taken . and the start
made.
You might think that being paid by the
minute "he nursed his job,"
5>ot a bit. The longer the Iron .Â¦was held
against the lead the hotter It would get.
and the longer the lead was hot' the more

and forty minutes later the man came out

' "Can you fix It?" said the foreman.
"Not on my 7 salary."
"What's the matter with you? Isn't $10
a day enough salary?"
"Yep: all right whllo.it lasts. But It
wouldn't last long If I Started In on that.
"Why, talk about 110 a day! I'd want a
dollar a minute to do that work/' , ;.
"Will you do It for a dollar a minute?"
\ The leadburner thought. He had said a
dollar a minute. That sounded like a
dream. But the reality. -There was the

Not that Miss D'Arvillc has ever

who have turned their backs on the
stage only to "right about face"

fore the honeymoon is over.
If an actress announces that she
is going to leave the stage the world
asks, sotto vocc, "For hozv long?"
It regards the marriage of an ac

life. The public reads of it with
unconcern, confident that the favor
ite will be back again next season.
Mary Anderson has been a no

Miss D'Arville has several engage

vorcing themselves from their pTO
fession and giving marriage a fair
chance.
Just before I left New York I took
afternoon tea with an actress who
stands at the top rung of the ladder.
A young woman who edits a popular
magazine raised the question of pro
fessional women marrying. There
were five of usâ each one, perhaps, a
fair representative of our chosen life
work. We came to the conclusionâ
"marriage does not handicap a wo
man in her profession, but a profes
sion seriously interferes with married
life." It isn't the career that suffers
when a woman marries: it's the horns
that gets the worst of the bargain.
So I don't give the usual "I'm
longing for a quiet life, etc.," as my
reason for leaving the stage. If I
thought the home and stage life could
ba successfully combined, I might try
it. Thinking to the contrary, I have
chosen between the two.
I must confess that I am very glad
to leava the stage while my voice ia
still fresh and true. That has always
been my earnest desire. To haves the
public remember me as I was at my
best, and not bid for applause on tha
merits of what has been.
There is something Infinitely pa
thetic in the repeated "farewell" con
certs of singeTS whoss voicas have
lost their charm. The world, which
gisres them a shrug of pity or a cruel
ltmgh, little knows what the loss of
voice means to a singer. It must be
honirle. Small wonder they refusa
to bcMeve that the power to sing i3
no longer theirs. They feel the s^me
rr.usic in their souls, but alas! they
can no longer express it. Even when
the world turns a disd-iinful ear to
their notes, the singer finds the ffict

When the artist, journalist, milliner

such intention, and . instead of the

Â« 'Heaven helD voul'*
'. Granted that actresses generally
do make a mess of matrimony. Isn't Â¦
it because the actresses, as a rule, at

too old-fashioned, forsooth, to enter into
our. progressive calculations. On account
of this very individual system of ours the
United States is to-day presented to the
world as a country barrenly devoid of ar
tistic resource.
At the Paris Exposition the smallest,
the most unimportant nation that you
may find on the map with a microscope
is better represented Â¦ than we ' are." Our
building is grotesquely ugly and contains
absolutely, nothing. Every other country
has tried to present something unique and
and a wnole room full. of Turners. There
is also a room devoted to Burne-Jones.
Here are his "Saint George," the beauti
ful anger of the martyrs, and a number
of others not so well known. t Hogarth's
"The Lady's Last Stake" hag been loaned
by , J. j Plerpont Morgan. The Queen has

examples of Constable and Lawrence..
Upstairs there are a long art gallery, two :
bedrooms, a china closet' and a bathroom.
The bcedrooms are Indescribably lovely.'
One in' particular, that I think of as the
Trlstam and Isolde room, is a real de
light, j. The,' quaintly, carved bedstead tells
the story of these unhappy lovers. Across
the top of It is an Inlald'frieze of. lords*
and â¢ ladles. > This . is beautifully - executed
in i color and looks like a bit of tapestry.
In the china closet are rare pieces of
Wedgwood and Royal Worcester and
fine examples of all Â¦.< the \ other . English
ceramics. As tickets of Invitation are re
quired to enter. the English pavilion it Is
never crowded and one feels as though he
were i visiting â¢ the. home of a friend. The
invitations are t not. hard, to get; for those
who take the trouble to ask for them.
The idea in having them is to keep out
the rabble, so that people who really ap
preciate the things exhibited may better
enjoy, them. Several other pavilions are
conducted in this manner^
As tho President visits the different pa
vliions the Paris journalists follow him
themselves in two and seemingly waited
for permission to raise their heads. I
suppose the stories about the hens and
the cowj? in the south of France, about
I^oubet's origin and early training, have
notxreached the ears of these Orientals.
To them Loubet is probably a great king,
for I doubt that the ordinary Oriental In
telligence, saturated as it is with exag
gerated Ideas of the great Jehovah on
earth, could grasp the notion of a repub
lic. The President seemed a little em
barrassed by the worshipful attitude of
his hosts and started In to shake hands'
with the whole outfit. ' I am wondering
whether he did the right thing or at least
if it were what they expected him to do.
I hardly believe it, as the handshaking
seemed much too condescending for this
excess of respect.
The English pavilion is now recognized
as one of the successes of the exposition.
It is .consistently and good
taste from cellar to garret. Outside it 13
not-so pretentious as many other build
ings, and during its construction it was
often criticized by the French for {Its
simplicity. But since the inside has been
completed all adverse criticism' ha3
ceased, notwithstanding that the French,
are very anxious at - thi3 particular time
to criticize anything that is English. The
building is designed to represent an old
English manor, and is furnished with all
the appliances of a country house. It Is"
partly an adaptation of the "Hall" at
Bradford-on-Avon, one of the finest ex
isting specimens of Jacobean architecture
of the early seventeenth century. Entering
by the main door the visitor is received
Into a large hall decorated with a-most
exquisite set of Burne-Jone's tapestries,
"the .Quest of the Holy Grael." On this
floor is a dining-room and a "deception
room, both of them furnished in. old En
glish style. The carved chairs and tables,
the beautiful, quaint, old - cabinet, "the
dainty light wood "grand" piano, ~ the won-^
derful mantels and luxurious rugs form:
an ensemble that is most delightful: But
best of all Is the extraordinary collection
of pictures and other works of art. .The
most precious objects of English art, from
numerous- private collections, have, been
loaned.'. Some of the best; Joshua Rey
nolds in existence' are "being exhibited.
There are a number of fine Gainsboroughs
till th<Â» exposition is over and see what
will happen. There is nothing but dis
content In the air that a peasant whose
mother wears a cap and an apron, who
feeds her own chickens and milks her own
cow, should be the host of kings. For the
idea In its completeness that all men are
born equal is not at all understood in this
make-believe republic. Felix Faure was
more of a success than Loubet. A splen
dU looking mad with a great deal of mag
netism and. assurance, he made himself
in many respects a king. He believed in
his own greatness and naturally was more
successful In forcing other people to be
lieve in it.
But poor loubet is like a fish out of
water. I never see him without experienc
ing a sensation of pity. He Is so appar
ently conscious of the contempt that he
inspires. 1 was at Versailles the day of
his election. I saw him pass out of the
palace amid the cries of "Conspucz Lou
bet." the most insulting expression that
the French can formulate. The fright
ened, cringing look upon his poor old face
that day Is one of the pictures In my
memory that time cannot efface. It re
quires a. lion-tamer to impress tho- French
people. He must look the beast straight
Id the eye without flinching, but Loubet
filnched at the first lifting of a paw and
loft his power. I have seen him several
times lately at the exposition. He is
making a round of official calls at the
various pavilions and may be seen almost
any morning In company with numerous
dignitaries. Yesterday morning I waited
to see him arrive at the Persian building.
A host of little black Persians, all done
up in thÂ«ir best flowing trousers and red
dest sashea. were waitlne to receive him.
The steps were covered with the finest of
Persian rugs and the doors were hung
with their most treasured curtains. The
President came from the English build
ing, just across the way, thus making the
contrast between Anglo-Saxon and Ori
ental politeness very conspicuous. I
watched the English gentlemen pay their
respects to him. There was every cour
tesy In their manner, still it was the
courtesy of man to man. They received
him simply and naturally, as one gentle
man receives another. But at the Persian
building all was different. The little fel
lows with the baggy trousers doubled
Â£â if â iRE heirs of the Frencn Kings dare
not put foot on French soil, for this
j> is a republic, we are told, whore the
principles are "Liberte, Egalite and
Fraternlte." "A bas raristocratle, vive
'/fcs',:;^." Such are the theories cf thus de
lichrfully inconsistent republic. At pres
ent, in t-r>ite of all their theories, v.-p are
having Â¦ lovely surfeit of royalty. Kings
are served to us for breakfast, lunch an<l
dinner. With its own royalty knocking
r.b<njt the world, without a country,
France is swinging incense and bowing
ur.fi prrapinp in the most adorinz fashion
before the Toyalty of other nations. For
several weeks I have been opening the
morning paper with t'ic greatest avidity
to learn how the Kins' of Swrrien had
passed the ni~ht or whaj he had for din
ner th<? evening before. Now that he has
pone, 1 5ho:!M feel a dreary void in my
rxiftence had not the Shah of Persia ar
rived to take his place. And the Shah, I
rnuyt confess, has more than replaced his
Majesty of Sweden. 1 find his ir.er.us
much more thrilling. They suggest more
tragic denouements and are altogether
!<Â«;<* common and ordinary. The King of
V- wed^n uses a fork and serviette like or
dinary mortals, but the Shah dips into
the dish with his fingers when so It
pleases him and wipes them on his shirt
front. A kfnply disregard for laundry
bills Is one of his characteristics. Then
my Interest in the Shah Is stimulated by
a Persian prince, who live? at my hotel
ard whose father is in the imperial suite.
The prince corroborates or denies to me
these journalistic reports, which of course
Is infinitely satisfying. Newspapers are
fo inaccurate! One morning it was even
published that the Shah had oaten cucum
bers the evening before, which the prince
vehemently denied. The Shah never eats
cucumbers, he protested they gave him
Indigestion. There Is nothing like know
ing the truth, and I value the prince's ac
quaintance f6r this opportunity that it
gives me. Now, the father of the prince
Is so r.ear and <2ear to the Shah that to
him Is accorded the most honorable duty
of tasting all of the preparations to be
served to the "King of Kings." The other
day the prince received bad tidings from
his sire. Some one had served at the
Shah's table a certain hot peppersauce,
meant to be administered a drop at a
time. But the Shah is never niggardly
toward hit favorite Minister. Seizing a
poupspoon he filled It to the brim and
passed it to the Minister, which the latter
emptied at one swallow. In consequence
the qualities of the Minister a* a taster
are somewhat impaired.
With all of their co-called republican
ism one king Is worth more in French es
timation than a whole carload of presi
dents. "Egalite" and "fraternite" are
â¢written all over their public buildings, but
es a matter of fact there is not one drop
of these sentiments in French blood.
French republicanism is only make-be
lieve. It Is simply a spectacular effect
that must be rendered at certain Intervals
for want of something betttr. The day
cf the Grand Prix I was riding in the Boi*
<3e Boulogne when the President and
Maria me Lcubet went by, returning from
the races. They were in the state car
riage, splendidly equipped and accompa
nied by twelve or fifteen outriders. An
lir.mer.se crowd had gathered to see them
pass, yot there was not a suggestion of
enthusiasm. A few faint cries of "Vive
Loubet" were drowned in more vigorous
ehouts of "Vive rArmec." As Loubet Is
not supposed to cherish toward^ the army
any very tender sentiments, such cr'.cs
were, of courÂ»c, a r.gbuke to him. The
vast majority of the persons assembled
maintained a sullen silence. Hardij" had
the President gone by when the K*tig *>t
Sweden appeared and then the uproar was
deafening. "Vive le Rol!" came unani
mously from thousands of throats. Every
man lifted his hat and the manner of
the entire rabble Indicated a sublime re
rpect where a moment before contempt
had been plainly written. The King re
rponded with "Vive la France." and then
the enthusiasm became wild.
Believe me. the divine right of kings
has not entirely lost ground in France.
Thi* influx of royalty that the Exposition
it bringing Is doing much to revive the
old sentiment In all of Its acuteness. Walt

13In the teeth of grazing animals we shall
find the chief practical Interest to He in
the comparative damage they do to the
grass; and in this connection Sir Walter
Gllbey has shown by diagrams In hlÂ»
. In the rodents we have to consider a
very interesting feature in the shape of
two incisors strikingly curved and devel
oped In either Jaw, the presence of which
at once indicates a habit of gnawing veg
etable food. These teeth are ever grow
ing and. should any cf the four be broken
by accident, the opposing Incisor will in
evitably grow unchecked Into the other
Jaw and bring about the animal's death
and starvation, to the hares and rabbits

teeth In the upper Jaw, immediately bo
hind the other two, but of the precise
significance of this supplementary pair I
do not recollect having read or heard any
satisfactory explanation.
nicmr>ers of its own order. Eschrfcht, &
German naturalist, discovered, sunk deep
In the gums of young whalebone whales,
traces of teeth; and this discovery gives
rise to the dcubt whether in bygone ages
these whalebone whales may not also
have posFCfsed teeth when full grown,
fcrdirg. like the cachalot. 011 fish. If so.
then did it also possess whalebone, and
for what purpose? Dentists tell us that
our own jaws are gradually diminishing in
length, and Darwin regarded our practice
cf cooking our food and thereby giving
our teeth less work to do as responsible
for the tendency cf t!:e wisdom teeth to
disappear.
The hand Is, as might be expected, of
less Importance to the Â»ower animals than
tO' man. In the majority of birds, with
Buch exceptions as the parrot3 and sono
others, the beak combines the function-*
of mouth and hands. The eagle's claw is
a symbol cf strength and says a good
deal for the character of Its owner, while
the hand of the ourangoutang. more hu
man and less rapacious looking, is. ac
cording to Dr. Wallace, able to tear open
the hardest fruits of the Malayan region. "
Still more remarkable Is the "attenuated,

of the grewsome looking ayeaye of Mad

In fishes the tongue is probably at Its
lowest stage of activity, but in reptiles
and amphibians, on tfae other hand, it
seems to play a more consistently useful
part than In animals of any other classes.
We no longer suspect the forked tongu>Â»
of poisonous serpents of "stinging" nor
do we believe that tho pythons lick their
victims in order to make them easier to
swallow whole. We do. however, assume
that the tongue acquaints the snake wlta
the fitness or otherwise for food of th*
things with which it comes In contact
and the toads and frogs actually capture
their insect food with their tongues. Kan
wonderful of all., however. Is the tongue
of the chameleon and one of the most sin
gular sights, of many, at the Zoo is tha
chameleon on the feed. as. rolling first one
eye then the other, grasping its perch
more tightly in Us strange handllke feet,
the chameleon catches the mealworms cr
black beetles presented to It by the keeper
with a lightning rapidity that defies a!I
but the fastest shutters In the photogra
pher's outfit. ' So remarkable is the whole
business thst visitors forget to look out
for the creature's ehanse of color that
they came purposely to see.
lories Is. of course, associated with thÂ«
process of sucking nectar from deep flow
ers, and I have already remarked on the
presence of such a tongue In the kea. ami
on the possibility of Its falling, now that
It is no longer needed, into disuse.
"Young Racehorses" that the teeth of
the horse, which meet, do far more harm
to pasture grass than those in the padded
mouth of the ox.
In the kangaroos we find the large in
cisors in the lower Jaw cropping the grai3
like scissors.-
Blrds, or those at any rate that exist
nowadays outside of paleontolosieal col
lections, have no teeth; nothing, in fact,
to represent them, unless we so regard
the serrated edges of the mandibles in
some flsh-eatlns klnd3 that will be no
ticed later.
Among the reptiles, which stand a Ut
tle lower than the birds, we find teeth in
tended for seizing rather than masticat
ing, for it is the simple practice of snakes
and their kind to "bolt" their victim?

two upper tubular fangs are conspicuous
whenever the creature opens its mouth,

for this reason that snakes are often un
able Immediately to relinquish their Bold
of any prey they may have seized. Thi3
and not greed, as seme of the newspapers
alleged at the time, accounted for the ac
cident at the Zoological Gardens when
two pythons, working at. opposite end* of
the same food, met In the middle and tho
larger had to swallow the smaller.
The teeth of fishes cover as a rule not
only both jaws but likewise the tongue
and palate. In the sharks and rays *i&
find supplementary rows of teeth ready
to replace those In front when use shall
have worn them down or accident ren
dered them useless; and in some of the
rays, notably In the thornhack, the teeth
of the male are sharp and pointed. wMlo
those of the female are blunt and flat.
This may or may not Indicate that the
male feeds on fishes, the female on shell
fish: but such at any rate are the re
spective diets assigned to such types of
teeth in the world of waters. In those
fish, as the mullets and sturgeons, that
eat soft food. the. teeth are either quito
feeble or altogether wanting.
The tongue, wnich we chiefly associate
with taste ami speech, is largely used in
feeding by certain classes of animals. N jC
to any great extent do the quadrupeds
avail themselves of its aid. though tho
great ant-eater thrusts its lor? and slimy
tongue among the ants, having tlrst torn
away the rides of their hills with claws
so powerful that Pates regarded th?m a*
fully capable of mauling a jaguar. These
who have seen the ant-eaters in the s'oth's
house at the 7.on may have noticed that
these animals walk practically ' on their
heels. The vampire bat. again, uses Its
rough-tipped ton sue in emptying certain
fruits of their pulpy conttnfs, and the
giraffe uses the same organ In stripping
the acacia branches of their leaves. Visit
ors to tnena series in which the glraff-.-s
have an open-air paddock with high trees
planted In it can easily see a hind of "high
water mark" on the denuded branches,
s-howing the highest point to which even
the tall giraffe cculd reach.
It will usually be, found that as a sort
of compensation mammals havlns such
unusual development of tongue have a
correspondingly poor equipment of teeth.
Xor. except in a few groups, is th<Â»
tongue conspicuously useful In birds. Our
awn woodpeckers show perhaps the mo3t
wonderful piece of mechanism from na
ture's workshop â a tongue of great length
packed away at the back of the head,
coiling and uncoiling with the force of a
*p!ral spring, tarbed and sticky at the
tip. What a terrible searcher of the grubs

Captain Thomson, who had made the

ahead until his rider could grasp the bridle
] firmly. Then came tho struggle. For a
hundred feet or more the vaquero horse,
almost stiff legged, was tearing the gravel
out of the road as he slowed down the
tons' weight of horses and rig. By thi3
time the outer runaway horse wa3
dragged up : half over the back of his

also leaning. With a . few. useless, llrcd
plunges they stopped, and while the po
liceman straightened his hat and held the

JpVv th<> road came an open carriage
and two black horses, running with
the spasmodic Jumps of a rabbit.
To the mounted men falls all the bril
liant work of stopping runaways, saving
riders and drivers, and arresting breakers
of the speed limit law.
At present the members of the mounted
squad are: S. M. Thomson. Nelson Nor
ton, Christopher Arellanes, T. J. Kava
nagh and Manuel de la Guerra.
The "trying out" process or practical
examination is left to Captain Thomson
and John McLaren, park superintendent.
Under the new charter In force In San
Francisco, the park squad has become a
part of the regular police force, with a
raise In salary from $S0 for mounted men
and $75 for foot men, to J1CO for each In
dividual, whether on horse or afoot. The
future selection of mounted men will be
left to thÂ«s Police Commissioners of San
Francisco and not to the Park Commis
sioners, but the examination will prob
ably be the same as heretofore.
The aspirant for mounted police honors
â having duly qualified as to character
and intellectâ Is taken by Captain Thom
son and Superintendent McLaren to the
trial ground, the speedway â the one place
in the park where driving over ten miles
an hour is not prohibited. He is mounted
on the regulation park horse, Spanish
saddle with high horn, curb bit and raw
hide lasso. The- initiate is first put
through his paces as a riderâ sent tearing
up and down the speedway at breakneck
pace, picking up handkerchiefs from the
groundv vaulting in and out of the sad
dle." and all at full gallop. Then he Is re
quired to catch a runaway horse by the
bridle; then to stop a horse and buggy,
and then to lasso an escaping. team. The
1: ;t and most difficult of all the tests Is
In the case of runaway teams, the ob
ject of the officer is to lasso the more re
fractory hcrae and bring him to a stand
still slowly and without upsetting the ve
hicle. Often this necessitates riding up
close to the team and steering It care
fully into some by-road, where there will
not be the danger of a collision with other
rigs. If the road la crowded and there Is
no time to loo?*>n a lariat, the man must
get the runaway by the bridle, lift its
forelegs bodily from the ground and set
the beast back on his haunches.
But one policeman has lost his life In
the service. That was the case of Sam
uel \V Harper. on<Â» of the most proficient
men on the force, who. In stopping a team,
fell under his own horse and received in
juries which resulted in blood poison. Tha
plucky fellow suved the lives of the peo
ple, but lost his own In the attempt.
The park Is never left without patrol.
One mounted man Is kept on duty from
3 p. m. to 12 a. m. and two foot men are
en duty all night. Saturdays. Sundays
and holidays see the whole squad out in
force at the hours when the park Is mosl
crowded.
r ,
Few park accidents have resulted In fa
talities and none after the police had
taken a hand*. There have been but one
or two cases where coachmen were thrown
from the box and killed before the officer
arrived on the scene to stop the runaway
and save the lives of the occupants.
To keep the men In ported practice they
have been given a drill regularly once a
week on the speedway, on lines similar
to the initiate's drill.
At the last three fcorso shows given in
San Francisco in lS!M-&-t>, Captain Thom
son and his men carried off the nrst prize
for all-around expert riding, rescuing and
lariat throwing.
Bicycle3 with dogs attached have also
recently been forbidden the use of the
parkâ so the man who wishes to exercise
his pet canine may have the opportunity
of finding both himself and dog tied to
the end of the same rawhide.
If the rider be too heavy to lift from
the fiddle the horse 1s checked by catch-
Ing the bit. If the bit be broken there Is
no alternative but to lasso the horse and
slowly stop him. This, however, requires
the greatest skill; first, to throw the rope
over the horse's head and not on the rider,
and second, to stop the horse In such a
way that the rider will not be unseated.
The men have become so expert with
their lariats that they can catch a bicy
clist going full speed and bring him to a
standstill without throwing him from hi3
wheel. Several times expert wheelmen
have endeavored to pass on forbidden
ground, despite the remonstrance of the
officers. Trusting to the speed of their
wheels they have rushed ahead only to
be brought up with a round turn and a
rope around their neck. The police have
as yet had no experience in roping gaso
line horses, but' they say they are ready
to try the automobile if necessary.
The principal work for the mounted men
is In handling the accidents which are now
of daily occurrence. Many a young girl'3
life has been saved by the stalwart arm
of one of Thomson's efficient squad, pick
ing her from the back of a fiery runaway
just In time â the rlderles3 horse, of
course, being allowed to goto be caught
farther up the line by a deftlasso.
to pick a person frcm the back of a run
away steed. If the novice be successful
in all the experiments he becomes a full
Hedged mounted park policeman. Under
the new law Captain Thomson and his
mer. remain for life â good conduct, etc.,
being considered.

this book cannot be too highly recom

The story deals with the strug
gle between the great Pompey
and the greater Julius Caesar and
matters political and social ' prior
the establishment of the empire.
The author shows wonderful familiarity
with his ancient authors and Is evident
ly a close student of the maps and rec
ords of the day. Some of the most fam
ous personages of the time, Julius Caesar,
Porapcy. Marc Antony, Cleopatra, appear
in the story. The "Friend cf Caesar" is
Quintus Livius Drusu*. the hero of. the
sr^ry, and betrothed, by the wills of their
respective parents, to a noble Roman
maiden. Cornelia. Contrary to tho gen
oral turn In fiction, v/hcre parents ?r

terly opposed by their children. Quintua
and Cornelia love each other dearly, but

rian history than Jokai. You can feel the
man's deepest sympathies are In his work,
and his perfect touch in the most trifling
detaUs of the life of the times gives an
absolute verity to his writings; moreover,
the author himself has known what it is
to fight in the cause of liberty, and with a
pen as powerful as his, strengtened by
the personal experience of hard service,
It would be impossible for him .to- write
anything other than an ei^g.ossing tale.
"The Baron's Sons" is one of the best
novels of the year.
The translator has cut the story down
from the original, but the work has been
well done, and as far as the English
reader Is concerned the curtailment will
not be noticed. The same direct, vigor
ous style has been retained and not a
thread of the narrative lost. As it stands
the book Is still a long one.
In the opening chapter the hard-hearted
Baron dies, leaving his wife commis
sioned to carry out to the letter all his
political schemes with reference to her
self and her three sons. The Baron is
hardly dead when she takes a sacred oath
to God to go directly contrary to the ln-
Htructlfjns which he had dictated to her
with his dying breath, and to espouse tne
cause of liberty.

AVinston Spencer Churchill probably
stands first among those who have re
corded the events of the Boer war. for he
risked his own life to save the lives of
others. His book "London to, Ladysmith
via Pretoria" is, as he himself says,
mainly a personal record of his adven
tures-and impressions during the first five
months of the African war. but as he was
with Sir Redvers Buller during the oper
ations conducted for the relief of Lady
smith, this personal record, becomes high
ly interesting.- and as it is accompanied
by excellent maps and plans It Is cor
respondingly valuable as a matter of his
tory. Mr. Churchill was special cor
respondent of the Morning Post and

II!s hollow eyes gleamed beseechingly
at her in tho gathering twilight. She
sprang up, walked up and down restlessly
and went to the window, where she could
see the first star shining down.
"Well?" he said.
There was silence in the sick room, but
a fierce battle was raging. Suddenly Eye
bright ran tack to the couch, caught his
hand and kissed it passionately.
"Go back to baby," she answered,
hoarsely; "go back to baby, and God bles3
her!"
Then she fled from the room.
At the foot of the stairs Hermann was
waiting for Prince Eyebright. who crept
down tottering, with white cheeks and red
I eyes, ij Â¦
"Ach," he said, "mein dear, you cry; dot
is right; den you vas one goot. girl; but,
ach, it vas all one tam pity."
It Is one of life's strange Ironies that
while battlefields have the most terrible
of death rolls, they equally have their rec
ords of births; and the very guns which
have taken their toll of life have given the
first greeting to lives newly born.
This was markedly the case In tbo
Franco-Cerman war, when hundreds of
children were born in hamlets and vil
lages which practically formed part of
the battlefields, and when the first sound
that newborn children in Strasburg and
other besieged towns heard was the roar
of the cannon thundering outside the
walls.
It Is little more than two years since
the death at Birmingham of one of our
oldest and most trusted railway guard?,
who was actually born while the bullets
were flying on the field of Waterloo. Hia
father, who was in a Highland regiment,
had gone out with our army to fight Na
poleon, and, his loyal wife followed him
later, only reaching Waterloo in time to
give birth to her child when the battlo
was raging at itM fiercest.
Ten years earlier the wife of a French
solrtier, called Chatasquon. gave birth to
a - boy on the battlefield ..f Au3terlltz.
while Napoleon's legions were mowing;
down Russians and Austrlans by thou
sands: and by a sad coincidence the boy'.-*
father was killed by a cannon ball almost
at the very moment of his child's birth.
On the battlefield of Gettysburg, where
Lee's army suffered such irreparablo
losses, the wife of a Confederate officer,
who had bravely followed her husband
through the campaign, gave birth to a
daughter, who, unfortunately, died in in
fancy: and another "child of the battle
field"' In the States lived to marry an emi
nent lawyer and politican, ami may con
ceivably one day be mistress of the White
House.
It is not many weeks since Alra. Miles,
one of the oldest ir.habitant.-i of Melroso,
died at the age of SO. Mrs. Miles' earliest
memories were associated with the hor
rors and discomforts of war. Her father,
who was a gunner, fought through the
Peninsular war, and his wife accompanied
him with her baby daughter, who had
been barn at Woolwich. Mrs. Miles to
the last remembered the booming of the
guns at Quatre Bras, and recalled the
grewsome picture of a Highlander whose
legs had been shot off below the knees.
It is scarcely surprising to learn that a
grandson of this martial old lady la fight-
Ing our battles to-day in South Africa.
The wife of one of the most eloquent
and successful of the younger French aÂ»l
vocates was introduced to war in its most
horriblo aspect at the immature age of
two years. At the close of the terriblo
battle of Sedan, when the field was
drenched with the best blood of France,
a tiny falr-halred, blue-eyed child was
found toddling from one group of fallen
men to another.
Siie seemed to realize nothing of the hor
ror, of her surroundings, and when ques
tioned was only able to say that her name
was "Estelle" (which she pronounced
"Etelle"), and that she wanted to go
home. She was placed in the care of the
wife of a French soldier, and although
every effort was made to discover her
parents they were never found.
Estelle grew up to be a girl of singu
lar beauty and sweetness of character,
and her foster parents, who had pros
pered in business, were able to give her
an excellent education. It was no sur
prise, therefore, when-, ten years ago, the
"Maid of Sedan" was led tn the altar by

Ing to his friends, ambition.â

Hermann out of the room.
"Why did you let her do it?" he asked,
sharply. , â¢
Hermann shrugged his shoulders. "Vat

'Papa Hermann, you help me make de

"No, she make me say de moneys all

"Well, tell him the truth."
"And make her angry, vat for I do

"Well, if you don't I shall. He ought
to be told; something should be done. He's
supposed to be a married man."
"Tam him!" said Hermann.
That evening the old violinist came to
Prince Eyebrlght and told her Mr. Mal
colm was better and wanted to thank her
for the flowers and. fruit she had sent
him, would she go up? The girl went, a
bunch of roses in her hand and' a quiver
at her heart. She was not in love with
this gentle spoken Englishman- for whose
sake she had secretly danced in the pub
lie street; or if she was she did not know
it. But his ways recalled the ways of
her old home, and he had been different
from tho others andâ she "was sorry for
him*,'' that was all. Being sorry made
her heart beat fast* as she turned the
handle of his door.
"Little girl." said- Malcolm very kindly
and gravely as he took her hand, "I be
lieve you have saved my life; you have
given me hack hope and faith and love.
I don't know how to thank you."
Then Eyebrlght knew Â¦ . that Hermann
had played her false and she .broke down
and crled'and felt very happy.
But she was not so happy ten minutes
later, as she listened, with averted face,
to Malcolm's account of his spoilt life
and the wife and child he had left In Eng
land.
"You see, it all was my fault," he eaid;
"I was careless and she was flighty, and
I suspected her unjustly. She had not
really been false, but by thÂ»jtime I knew
that, suspicion had destroyed what love
we had for each other, so we": thought it
best to go our separate ways?'
"Did you love her very much?" asked
Prince Eyebrlght, miserably.
"Well, no; I am afraid not: It was Just
a commonplace marriage that we had
drifted into. But you see, there Is the

It is from my mother. She pleads for

The revival of coaches some years ago

The detection of criminals will, it is be

In regard to fingernails. When a crime 13
committed it is Important to learn
whether the perpetrator Is right handed
or left handed, and an examination of -the
fingernails will ( throw- ubundant light on
this point? Dr. Regnault, In a paper read
before the Anthropological Society of,
Paris, show3 that there is a wide differ

those of the loft hand, and that the nails
of the right hand of a right handed per
son are broader than thoso of the left
hand, while the opposite is the case with
loft handed persons. *
Some New Facts
About Finger Nails.
Ecuador Is the real home of the hats
Â¦wrongly designated under the name of
"Panama." This Industry afterward ex
tended to Peru and other countri"?, even
to Yucatan in Mexico. Kvervwhere in
Latin America the hat Is known under
the name of "jipijapa." in honor of the
city where its manufacture was first
Ftarted. It is only outside of the produc
ing countries that this hat receives the
r.ame of a city which does not make it.
The finest hats are made in Jipijapa and
MontecriFtl, in the province of Manabi.
this Industry being one of the greatest re
eources of the country. The toquilla, or
leaf of a small plant. Is used for this
purpose. It grows abundantly in the
country, the leaves coming up In the
shape of a fan. The plant Is the Carludo
vica palmata.
There are Jipijapas of all qualities, from
those costing a few centavos. or American
cents, to those worth several hundred
cucres, or American dollars. The merit of.
these last, real marvels of fineness, con
sists as much in the scarcity of the straw
as in the difficulty of the weaving, and
therefor? it is exceptional to find these
nats on the general market. The hats of
current sale cost a few sucres, the finest
not exceeding from TO to 60 sucres in price.
In buying a panama it is necessary to
learn two things â if the straw 13 whole
*>nd if it is not stiffened. It Â«.s not easy to
recognize the first condition. The weavers
/plit the straw with such Â»:rfectlon thai
unless a person Is accustomed to such ex
aminations it is almost impossible for him
to distinguish the difference. Of equal
fineness, the hat made from whole straw
is worth three or four times the on6
manufactured from the straw that haa
been split. The second condition !s recog
nized rasily, for the hats are stiffened to
make the etraw firmer and whiter. Good
toquilla is white and stiff enough not to
need any gum, and 'only ordinary Pana
ma are stiffened,

THE cUnlng-room Is the room of r'.I

ply ourselves to our friends. Here the
inner man Is taken care of.
The dlnlng-rocmâ that is. the dining
rcom as we of this age know itâ is cer
tainly of very recent style. In the earlier
days our ancestors ate in the hall; then
later a banquet hall was built for cere
monial purposes. Two very admirable
descriptions of the old-time dining hall
are those found In Dumas* "Twenty
Tears After" and Scott's "Ivanhoe."

The very word "dlnlng-roo-m" breathes

The old English house plans were often
built with two or three rooms designated
E-s dining-rooms and which could be used
at different seasons of the year. They
In no manner resembled our modern din
ing-rooms, as they were not in direct con
nection with the kitchen and were prob
ably used for living rooms when not In
use for dining purposes. Recently the
dining-room has been specialized as an
apartment for dining purposes only.
In the middle ages people dined at long
tables composed of boards resting on
trestles, while the seats were narrow
benches or stools so constructed that they
could be carried away after the meal was
over.

The dining-room should be the most se
vere and set In Its furnishings of any
room in the house. It should look digni
fied and substantial. Never overcrowd it.
A. table, square or round, as preferred;
chairs, a sideboard in antique style;- a
buffet and two china closets are sufficient
One of the closets is for crockery; thÂ«
other, for cut or Bohemian glassware.
VJllh the Flemish" or English furnish
ings, the room must be larce. with high
ceilings and plenty of wall "expanse.
Heavy furniture marks these styles.

HAVE YOU AN ARTISTIC DINING ROOM?
In the Colonial style one finds paneled
walls, with hardwood floors, rugs, mahog
any table, chairs and woodwork.
To those who object to the darker
shades the French oak Is used. It Is
much lighter and browner. The wood
work and furniture should harmonize.
Tapestry walls, either real or In paper,
are used; rugs, with hardwood or Inlaid
floors. If preferred carpet can be used,
and In our damp winter climate Is per
haps to be preferred. Â«
A very pretty idea, but one which can
be carried out better In a., country home
than in a town house, is to have a door
way leading from the dining-room Into
the garden or to a veranda. This 13 a
French or Spanish conception, and gives
to a dining-room a more homelike air.
A fireplace Is always essential in a din
ing-room. To come down to breakfast on
a cold, bleak morning there Is nothing
like a roaring, crackling wood fire to
make things cheerful. If the room hap
pens to be without a fireplace It give3
the brcakfaster a fit of blues that would
probably last throughout the day.
In San Francisco are many ideal din
ing-rooms. Among them Is that In the
Hobart residence, at the corner of Wash
ington street and Van Xesa avenue. This
is finished in antique mahogany, with
high wainscoting, magnificent sideboard]
and charming and cozy fireplace. On
each side of the fireplaco are benches.
Another dining-room, extremely original
in design. Is p:i!nteil in whito with a
about five feet high. Above
this is a shelf to the ceiling. The wall
pbove and sif'fs ar* papered in delft pat
tern, blue and white. The decorations of;
eld china are in the same shades. Tb.3
furniture Is of mahogany. T'nis is a
much smaller room than that in the Ho
bart house.
The decorations of dining-rooms should
be nf the simplest. A few pictures on the
walls are not out nf place Still-life stud
ies are usually preferred, f'n the shelves
are found old brass canuk sticks, plates,
platters and delft jars. Since it became a
fad to collect steins these are also fouml
ranged in rows along the shelves. A few
palms by the windows add to a dining
room's air of general comfort.
Accidental Discoveries of Importance.
The rolling of cold iron was first sug
gested. It is said, by a workman who wns
placing a piece of hot iron in the rolls and
carelessly allowed his tones to be drawn
in also. Noticing that the tongs rolled
without breaking, he called the attention
>f the' superintendent to the Incident. The
matter was investigated. experiments
were made, and it was found that cold
rolled iron is equal to steel for shafting
purposes.
A Nuremberg glass-cutter accidentally
filscovered the art of etching upon glass.
A. few drops of aquafortis fell upon hi3
spectacles and he noticed that the acid
caused the glass to corrode and soften. He
Rt once took the hint, drew figures upon
the glass with varnish applied the aqua
fortis, and then cut away the glass from
around the drawing. Removing the var
nish, he found the figures that he had
drawn raised upon a dark background.
Flnlguerra, the master of early engrav-
ing. delighted in dting deeds of kindness.
One day a washerwoman. In washing a
piece of clothing 1 in which a needle had
been carelessly left, had the misfortune
to run it Into her hand. The needle broke,
and more than half of it was left Im
bedded in the n>sh. It gave her much
pain, and as soon as she could she went
to FiniRiierra's studio, put down the
bundle oi damp clothes that she was
carrying to the owner, and asked the
artist to help her. After much patient,
careful manipulation with his fine tools, j
hÂ» succeeded In extracting the. broken'
needle.
The woman thanked him and as she
lifted h"r damp bundle to leave the studio
Kinitruerra noticed that It had rested
upon one of his fnsravin^s and had re
ceived an excellent impression from it.
The engraving, like all others of that
time, was a metal plate complete In Itself,
pnd was regarded aÂ« a sir.gle 'picture.
The Impression made upon the damp cloth
suggested to the alert mind of Finijruerra
the possibility of producir.sr an indefinite
number of pictures from a single original.

very anxious to sell you something, go
out yourself and see If you have any
difflculty of disposing of your prospective
purchase before you close the transac

turn off some worthless stock on your

Out toward the "suburbs the gripmen
have another sort. : of trouble. It is the
small, marble-playing clement.-- 7 Â«!
"Those 1 cussed kids," says the motor
man, "they will squat right down in the

older kid grabs him out of the 'way or

Considering. the opportunity for trouble
and people's persistence in getting In the
way of the car, the griprnan's opinion Is
that there is a very small percentage of.
accidents. Although there are many an-

woman, sliding back into her place, as she
observed the amused smiles of the other
passengers.
The gripman must have got out of bed
the wrong way that morning. Little
things annoyed him. A big truck wagon
was dragging .lions In /ront and paid no
attention to the ringing oOthe bell. Busi
ness men with their newspapers and "la
dies with shopping bags stared angrily,
first at the wagon and then at the grip
man. Finally the wagon began to turn
aside, and after dragging' one ponderous
hind wheel along the track for a half
block got out of the way. As the car went
by the grlpman's face was very, red, and
he yelled some inaudible words at the
driver, who was Irish, ."Arrah, g'wan. wld
car t!i* Infernal thing !s sure to Btart op
e.t on<-e and graae your heel as you get
out of the way. Just to make you feel

When a pripman docs get into an accident
It's pretty, rough. The prejudice of the
public Is such that they never stop to
reason, end their sympathies are always
the grfprr.an. The moment any
thing goes wrong there Is a hue and cry
about the carelessness of the gripman.
I'eop'.o persist in, getting In the way. and
when they get hurt they want to lynch
the gripman. Absent-minded old gentle
men stand la the middle of the track and

Uie answer.
A dapper little man pulled out his watch
nervously. "Say, aren't we going to make
that half-past boat?" he asked for the
'hlrd time.
"Will make it If I can," replied the grip
man, as he slowed up for a butcher cart
and a milk Wagon to get cut of the way.
Within two blocks of the ferry a- lumber
wagon dropped off a hind wheel and fell
ddwn on the track. Tho hands of .the fer
ry clock pointed to twenty-eight and a
half minutes past the hour.. The nervous
little man made a wild dash and sprinted
for his boat. The rest of the passengers
got off, inquiring if they had to walk the
rest of the way, and some of them asked
for transfers to the horse car line. They
didn't get them, and went away dissatis
fied. .. . ' ,
A car .was just' getting a lively start at
the crossing of ?.Iarket and Third streets.
A schoolgirl came running across from the
sidewalk, leaned quickly toward tho front
of the car. caught hold of a bar nn\.
Bwunjj neatly Into a seat." Every one
looked Interested and smiled admiration.
The gripman had made a wild grab for his
brakes, but he was too late, and had to
content himself with shaking his head and
telling her never to do It again. He rea'ly
could not have been much worried after
seeing how easily it was done, but he had
to give his warning. "There'll come a
time." fiaid he, "when you'll make a mis
etep." Shn was rather proud of her ac
complishrrtent. evidently. A few blocks
further on she leaped quickly to' her feet
and swung off. smiling unconcernedly as
she tucked up her skirts and wa'iked
nway. .
"Them's the kind that gives us the trou
ble," remarked the gripman. "They think
they're so smart, and they try it all thg
time. Then they get careless, and get
hurt."
"It is surprising how many people in
San Francisco are ignorant of the im
portance of a stop mark. They attempt
in the middle of a b'o-^k. half-way between
the stop marks, and wave their hand?
wildly, growiu? angrier and angrier as
each car poos by, wondering what in th<
name of science is the. matter with the
gripman, thinking how the stupid, ma
licious fellow ought to be reported, etc.,
until they finally gather the significance
of the gripman's motion backward. Then
they manage to catch a car and refuse to
understand their mistake, feeling very
much abused and angry toward the rail
way company.
Bicyclists are the trial of the gripman.
"I nearly killed one the other night." said
a Haisht-street motorman. "He was rid

attention to the bell. I kept ringln' for
him to get out of the way, but he kept
gliding along in front, just slow enough to
worry me and keep me from turning on

WASHINGTON. Aug. 23.â The State De

American Consuls in China return to their

The attention of the department has been
called to those statements emanating
from various Consuls .to the effect that
they left their posts at the direction of
the department. The officials say that is
not correct; that the Consuls were merely
permitted by the department to leave
their posts on their own responsibility if
they, considered their lives were* In dan

fears there may be more rioting at Akron.
For that reason troops will be held there
until Monday at least. This decision was
reached to-day at a conference between
the Governor and Assistant Adjutant

"The ill-feeling among the Akron citi

WASHINGTON, Aug. 25.â Chinese of
ficials expressed a belief to-day that Li
Hung Chang, the Chinese peace envoy,
had started for Peking or Tientsin. While
there is said to be no official advices to
this effect, yet It is so In accordance with
the expectation of China's course that the
officials accept It as a fact. If this proves
to be correct It may bring about an early
opportunity for personal exchanges be
tween Earl LI and the commanders of the
allies and the Ministers of the respective
powers.
.The Chinese Government has been en
tirely silent since the capture of Peking
except In the two communications from
LI Hung Chang, and up to the present
time Minister Wu has received no word
responsive to the American communica
tion sent him by Mr. Adce last Wednes
day. Three days have passed, and there
has been ample time for LI Hung Chang
to formulate his next move. . In the cir
cumstances It is felt he accepts the Amer
ican and German answers, and such oth
ers as may have reached him, as negativ
ing: any present prospect of negotiations
along the lines he proposed. The opinion
Is expressed that this will prolong the un
certainties of the diplomatic situation,
during which Earl Li will seek to meet
the requirements laid down by the United
States and the other powers, while the
latter will endeavor to. reach some com

According to a special dispatch from Ber

The Foreign Office considers. the idea oi

control in Peking and the occupied parts
of China until Count von Waldersee shah
have assumed command and have had
time to report on the situation.
The generally well informed Viedemosti
of St. Petersburg says it is the opinion in
diplomatic quarters there that the with
drawal of the allies from Peking, now
that the foreigners have been rescued,
would facilitate peace negotiations.

The note issued by the Vatican authori
ties against the prayer of Queen Margha
retta, written by her Majesty after tlu
assassination of King Humbert, has ser
going a violent discussion in Italy. The
Rome correspondent says: "Its publica
tion has caused indignant outbursts, ,has
invoked sympathy for the Quirinal and
has strengthened the young King in his
inherited controversy with â¢ the church.
The note was a personal "act of the Pope
and its avowal as such was meant to re
buke those representing the Pontiff as
an aged man and as a tool in the'hands
of Cardinal Rampolla. the Papal secre
tary of state, the truth being" that Ram

Note From the Vatican.
It would be supposed that the question
of the superiority. of the American method
of riding horses had been sufficiently de
monstrated by this time to convince
even the conservative English horsemen.
The sporting papers, however, are stil!
filled daily with letters on this subject.
The bitter reluctance with which the
friends of British jockeys admit the ad
vantage of the American system Is a
curious part of the controversy. This has
gone so far that a writer in the Sports
man to-day calls for a halt in the discus
sion and advocates the American system,
which, he says, "certainly suits our
horses, owners and trainers," adding, "let
us still be sportsmen, even if we are
beaten at our own game."
The introduction of the young King of
Spain to his subjects on the northwestern
seacoast was attended by a degree of
good feeling not before seen in Spain in
generations. Even in the provinces where
socialistic and dynastic discontent is al

showed patriotic pleasure and a desire
to forget the past disasters and accept the
new order of things. . N .

The Spectator says it does not wish to

The Speaker considers a French inva

"That the French Government is pre
paring for war there can be no longer any
doubt." This first sentence in a long arti
cle in the Pall Hall Gazette of "Wednesday
on "The Imminence of War With France"
is the subject of serious speculation In
most of the periodicals.
"Continental statesmen look askance at
the new force, America, whose limits they
do not clearly discern, and which for ex
ample can send black troops to China, and
they mutter words about the possible
Anglo-Saxon understanding, and would, it
they could, gladly postpone all action so as
to have more time for reflection and com

Nothing has been received here from Li Hung Chang since his request for the appoint
ment of a representative to negotiate with him for terms of peace. It is not even known where Li
Hung Chang is. At the Chinese Legation to-day it was said that he had probably gone to Pe
king. If he has really gone to Peking it is suggested here that he may have done so with the ob
iect of endeavoring to bring about the conditions laid down in Mr. Adee's note.
If the replies received to the instructions sent out yesterday show such a difference among
the powers as to make harmonious action difficult, the next step of the administration may be to
propose an international conference, for if this proposition is not received favorably by the powd
ers, it will try to accomplish the same result by an interchange of notes.
Replies were received to-day from several capitals. The nature of these replies are not
disclosed by the State Department, but it is learned that they show much diversity of opinion as
to recognizing Li Hung Chang. It is understood that Germany takes strong grounds against
such recognition. The question of recognizing the Viceroy involves the character of the Gov
ernment he represents. Should the course outlined in Mr. Adee's reply to Li Hung Chang be fol
lowed, it would soon be demonstrated whether the Government is one which could fulfill its obli
gations and restore order in China. It is required by this that security be established in Peking
and the Government must show its ability to stop hostilities preliminary to the appointment of rep
resentatives of the United States to treat with Li Hung Chang.
Despite the apparent evidence of discord at Peking, the United States will strive earnestly
to secure harmony of action among the powers in dealing with China. The sending out yester
day of instructions to Embassadors and Ministers of the United States at the capitals of the pow
ers was the first step in that direction. Under these instructions American diplomats were to
sound the Governments as to their attitude on the question of recognizing Li Hung Chang as
the representative of China to negotiate with the powers

contain the assertion that the Russian commander had forbidden communication with the Chi

this information did not reach Admiral Remey as official news, it came as a report from reliable
sources in Peking, which he thought this Government should possess as its own information. No

The Navy Department has been at pains

TO FORTIFY THE
ISLAND OF GUAM
The programme for the religious exer
cises which are to be held in the Audi
torium to-morrow has been arranged as
follows: The principal address will be by
Commander in Chief Shaw of the G. A. R.
He will-talk on "True Patriotism." Bishop
Fallows will deliver the address of greet
ing, it being- preceded by the Lord's
The dedicatory exercises proper com
'prlsed an address by Frank Lowden of
Chicago, a response by Mayor Harrison
and addresses by other local speakers.
The members of the Grand Army and
their friends have been pouring into lhe
city all day long on regular trains, and
Innumerable specials from all parts oX the
country. It is estimated that 30,000 of
them arrived to-day and many times that
number are expected to arrive to-morrow
and Monday. The chief arrival to-day
was that of the Spanish Minister, the
Duke de Arcos, with the Countess de
Arcos. They were met at the Lake Shoic
depot by a committee representing the G.
A. R. and another jrepresenting the clty
of Chicago and escorted to the Auditorium
Annex, where apartments had been pro
vided for them. The escort on the way
from the depot to the hotel was headed
by the Denver flfe and drum corps. Gen
eral Dan E. Sickles arrived to-night.
PHICAGO, Aug. 25.â The National
Encampment of the G. A. R. was
I opened to-night by the dedication
I . of the new Coliseum, in which the
joint camp fires of the reuniÂ«i, the
war song concerts of the veterans and the
religious and other exercises for the pub
lic incidental to the encampment will be
held. The Coliseum stands on Wabash
avenue, between Fourteenth and Six
teenth streets, and within its walls to
night were gathered 10,000 people.
A chorus of 1000, costumed to represent
a living flag, occupied an Immense plat
form at one end of the building, and close
by them was the great band of 100 pieces
that will render the concerts during the
coming week of the encampment. Jules
Lombard, a famous singer of war-times,
was there and sang the "Star Spangled
Banner" from the original manuscript.
It Is estimated that 20,000 veterans have
already arrived here and are quartered
about town, most of them with friends or
at hotels.
"There are thousands of veterans who
had hoped to meet the President during
the encampment," said Commander Shaw,
"and they will be disappointed. They are
not the ones, however, to wish the Presi
dent to leave his duties during the present
grave period."
The President's final decision that the
gravity of the Eastern situation will not
allow him to attend the encampment was
received .with disappointment at Grand
Army headquarters, as well as at the
Hamilton Club, where he was expected to
be the chief gu^st Tuesday night.
At Van Buren street, on the north, and
Eldredge court, on the south, half a mile
from Van Buren street, stand great
arches that on Van Buren street being In
honor of the army, the other In honor of
the navy. Between the two arches are
placed pn both sides of the street at In
tervals of twenty feet pillars of white,
surmounted by a ball.
Upon the front of each pillar Is a shield,
around the edges of which are electric
lights, diagonal lines of lights also cross
each shield, and the -whole effect, com
bined with the tasteful arrangement of
lights upon the arches, made the scene
to-night one of great beauty. The streets
in the neighborhood were so Jammed to
night by thousands of spectators as to
be almost impassable.
The court of honor on Michigan avenue
built in honor of the Grand Army was
illuminated to-night for the first time, and
although on a smaller scale it surpasses
anything seen here since the World's Fair.
Prayer by Rev. Dr. F. W. Gunsaulus,
Rev. J. D. Severlnghaus will conduct the
responsive reading. Rev. Dr. Hirsch will
deliver an address on patriotic and relig
ious lines and the final speaker on the
programme will be Rev. Dr. Thomas C.
Cliff of Salt Lake City.
An elaborate musical programme will
also be rendered. The afternoon services
at the Coliseum will be for children and
will include addresses by Commander In
Chief Shaw, Bishop Fallows and Rev. B.
W. Arnem of Wilberforce, Ohio.

and two naval officers has already been
assigned to the work of the preliminary
survey and upon their recommendations
the future work in this line will be made.
The exhibition has given a pretext for
unusual license in the display and produc
tion of so-called "post-cards," bearing
suggestive and in many cases obscene pic
tures. M. Beranger, a life Senator and a
leading spirit in the reform movement
here, took up the matter, members of the
opera corps and Pallet representatives
having protested that their features were
attached to photographs In Indelicate
scenes. These cards were openly dis
played in shop windows and on the boule
vards. The police organized a general
raid and in one day seized 50,000 "post
cards," 600 photographs and fourmuto
scopes on the north bank of. the
alone. Similar operations on the south
bank are affording- an equally good and
plentiful harvest.
A serious situation has arisen, accord
ing to reports from Marseilles and Toulon,
on the French-Moroccan frontier.
Troops are said to be massing- In great
numbers in dangerous proximity to the
Algerian frontier, and Moroccan tribes
men, it is asserted, are raiding French
territory. Instructions are said to have
been received at the Mediterranean naval
station directing the French naval au
thorities to prepare to dispatch artillery
and stores to Algeria, while orders for
contingents of troops from. Algeria and
Tunis for the Far East have been counter
manded. In official circles in Paris, al
though it is admitted that the situation
needs watching, it is thought decidedly
improbable that the Moroccan Govern
ment Intends to conduct hostile operations
against Algeria. Â¦

"We have no revenge to seek in China
and we have no intention to demand such
compensation in the shape of indemnities
as will create resentment against foreign
ers. Our policy will be one of liberal ed
ucation, the effort to teach this great
mass of people to trust and regard Euro
peans favorably. In the end this may re
sult in the advancement of civilization
for the one and commercial prosperity
for the others. Those who think that a
change of government will change the
character of the Chinese people have not
a broad understanding of the deep-seated
ideas which centuries have bred in them.
To make a radical upheaval of their form
of government just'at this time would do
more harm than good. We shall attempt
to tlnd a suitable person of liberal ideas
toward foreigners who will assume the
reins of government. Our position fol
lows the identical lines of the United
States in nearly every instance. Com
mercially we wish the broadest interna
tional construction to be placed upon for
eign privileges, and it is a fact that had
not your country declared an 'open door'
at the time it did France herself would
have done so. The reply made by the
United States to Li Hung Changes re
quest for the appointment of an emissary
to act with a view to a settlement anil
the establishment of peace receives gen
eral approval here. France will take a
similar position, for we must be assured
that we are negotiating with a concrete
body, and not with. a shadow. While Wb
have special commercial interests in
Yunnan and Szechuen, our desire to de
velop that region would be defeated
should we act on narrow, selfish ideas
there."
The small anti-governmental papers are
still barking over the acceptance by
France of Field Marshal Count von Wal
dersee as commander in chief of the allied
forces in China, and the sincerity of Rus
sia's friendship is impugned, as these pa
pers say that It was Kussia that sug
gested Count Waldersee as the comman
der in chief.
The Gaulois calls attention to the fact
that at a conference presided over by
Prince Bismarck, when outside of Paris,
in a discussion as to whether Paris should
be taken by assault, Count Waldersee ex
pressed the wish to "see this Babylon en
tirely destroyed."
French Territory Invaded.
PARIS, Au?. 25.â The Viceroys of the
various provinces of China may . be con
voked to choose some one of weight in the
empire to deal with the powers in estab
lishing such a government as will assure
the fulfillment of whatever terms the
powers shall dictate in settlement of their
claims arising from the recent outrages,
and one who will give satisfactory guar
antees of a complete change of Chinese
policy toward the outside world. Such
a solution has been suggested in diplo
matic circles, but with the corps absent
on vacation and President Loubet and M.
r>elcasse, Minister of Foreign Affairs, out
of town the idea has not assumed a crys
tallized form. Hope Â£till exists tfcat a
strong central power will be found in
Peking, which will constitute the best
guarantee for the future, the best means
of securing- - reparation for the wrongs
suffered by Europeans and the best safe
guard against division among the powers
themselves. *
Now that the allied forces have entered
the Forbidden City the necessity for the
maintenance of concord among the pow
ers Is most pressing. Yet fears are in
creasing that the strain of conflicting in
terests and ambitions may cause a cleav
age among the nations interested. This
danger has been demonstrated already by
the individual action of Russia in seizing
the present opportunity to extend her
frontier Into Manchuria and the recent in
cident regarding the landing of British
troops at Shanghai. While no official
statement is forthcoming as to the posi
tion of France, in the absence from Paris
of those in control of her foreign policy,
the following, emanating from an official
associated with the French Government,
expresses the views of the Foreign Office
at the present juncture: -

to His Death.
LONDON, Aug. 25.â Lord Roberts has
left Pretoria and has established his head
quarters at Wondeifontein, the seconc'
station west of Machadodorp, where the
bulk of the Boers are supposed to bo.
Wiring 1 from there. Augrust 24, he says:
"Buller reports the Boers laid a trap
for his cavalry August 23, opening with
several guns at fairly short range. The
English guns silenced the Boers, but when
the firing ceased and the pickets were
being placed for the night by some mis

out of sight of the main body, where they
were surrounded by the Boers and suf

"The Liverpools lost ten men killed and
Captain Plomer and forty-five men
wounded. In addition they had thirty
two men missing.
"General Buller's other casualties, Au
gust 23, were twenty men killed, wounded
or missing."
Lord Roberts also wired that General
Pole-Carew occupied Belfast, near Mach
adodorp, August 24, without opposition.
General French, with four brigades of
cavalry, is moving west of Machadodorp.
The dispatch of the British commander
in chief in South Africa also says: "There
is a welcome green over the veldt, which
I hope means that our riding and trans
port animals will g^et grazing shortly.
They have fared badly of late."
A special dispatch from Pretoria, dated
August 24, gives details of the execution
on Friday of Lieutenant Cordua, of the
Transvaal artillery, convicted by a court
martial of breaking his parole in plotting
to abduct Lord Roberts and his brother
officers. Cordua walked fearlessly to tha
garden at the jail. At his own request
he Â¦was not bound and sat in a chair with
folded arms. He told Captain Barchard,
commanding the firing party, that he wai
ready and ten bullets struck him. The
bodv Â¦was buried near the spot where the
lieutenant fell.

emphasize the statement that Germany,
after the taking of Peking and Field Mar
shal Count von \Va!tiersee"s appointment
to the command of the allied forces in
China, stands in precisely the same atti
tude as before. Germany, it is added,

his circular of July 3. and which was
approved here and abroad. It is also of
ficially claimed that all the other power*
interested still adhere to that programme,
of which there now remain two still siost
important paragraphs, viz: Adequate re
driFs for Chinese crimes against inter
national rights and the re-estaJjIishmcnt

able to give guarantees against the recur
rence oi the recent outrages. Many

View of John W. Bookwalter,
Holds That the Czar Will, as a Mat

the Dismemberment of
China.
Correspondence of the Associated IJress.
LONDON, Aug. 18.â John W. Bookwal
ter of Ohio, whose recent books on Si
berian and Asiatic problems have been
much quoted in recent English papers, is
now in London. In an interview Mr:
Bookwalter said:
"The present situation in China seems
to me is not its serious phase, as it is
likely to precipitate the whole Asiatic
problem, with its many complications for
permanent solution. There are two chief
considerations in this problem. First, the
double relation Russia occupies toward
China and that which Russia occupies to
ward England through her dependency in
India, for since the grand operation of the
great Trans-Siberian and Trans-Caspian,
railroad systems Russia has been brought
into direct contact M'ith China from the
Hinterland. It is obvious, therefore, that
Russia is the mo3t potent factor in direct
ing events which will determine what the
future relations of the various nations
shall be in the Asiatic continent.
"It is hardly likely that the contest be
tween Western civilization and Eastern
civilization, which must inevitably occur
sooner or later, would have developed al
the present time had it not been for the
building of Russia's great railroad lines,
the effect of which would be to establish
a practical dominance of Russia in Asiatic
countries, and which might be regarded
as a menace to those nations now holding
spheres of Inliuence there, as well as to
those who see in the possible partition of
China opportunities for territorial ag
grandizement.
Conditions Changed.
"As an indication of this change it may
be said that Russia was ten years ago
the "farthest nation away from China, sep
arated by impassable steppes apd without
a navy, while all the other European pow
ers could .reach the Chinese littoral by
water. The building of these railroad
systems has rapidly changed the entire
situation, bringing China, politically and
commercially, to the very,doorB of Rus
sia and making a coterminous border of
from 4OU0 to 5000 miles.
"In fact it brines China in physical con
tact with the Russian empire alone, her
contact with other nations being only
through the dependencies of those na
tions. In view of these important facts
it is easy to s<Â« what is to be the prob
able relation of Russia to China, which
seems to me can only be of the most
friendly character, and to that end the
maintenance of the integrity of the em
pire, especially the Middle Kingdom, is of
paramount importance.
"I believe that when a general showing
of hands, is made it will be apparent that
if there is not an actual alliance between
Russia and China there will be found to
be an intimate co-operation for the main
tenance of their political and commercial
interests. Under these considerations it
does not seem possible that the partition
of China among the Western powers can
occur, nor could a composite control be
established, since Russia's imperial inter
ests demand that she deal with a perma
nent situation, such as a united China
would insure, rather than the ever-chang
ing condition certain to follow the dis
memberment of China among otljer na-
Interests Identical.
â¢ "Suppose there existed In British Amer
ica a nation with three times the popula
tion of the United States, that this coun
try fell into evil ways under insurrection
and that European powers found It neces
sary to send troops, under cover of whom
they attempted to effect territorial divi
sion or a composite control. The United
States would rightfully and immediately
say, 'Hands off,' that this nation bordered
on the United States and not on others,
and that no change in the present status
be permitted without her consent. Under
the circumstances it would seem there
fore probable that an identical note will
be issued by Russia and China, in which
they will Jointly agree to guarantee the
Integrity, of the Chinese emplre,;which Is
In direct line with the present expressed
views of the various powers and also the
safety of foreign residents and the prop
erty of other nations in the country. Such
a guarantee from some such powerful and
reputable nation as Russia would carry
with it such weight that a refusal to ac
cede to it by the powers would certainly
lead up to a most critical * international
situation and probably a clash of nations.
Ito Issues a Manifesto.
YOKOHAMA, Aug. 26.â Marquis Ito,
formerly Prime Minister, has issued a
manifesto setting forth the aims of his
party, which is called the Constitutional
Political Association, and from the ranks
of which the next Cabinet will probably
be drawn. The manifesto emphasizes the
fact that the appointment and dismissal
of the Ministers are constitutional pre

the Ministers are In office it Is not per
missible to their party to interfere with
the discharge of their duties. The press
urges the sending of troops to Korea. The
Cabinet hesitates; but a Japanese cruiser
has been sent to the vicinity of Gensan.

The cause of nervousness Is, generally,
overwork, mental worry, or Impoverished
blood. Any one with pure, rich blood,
who takes not too much exercise, nor too
little, gets plenty of sleep, knows nothing
about nervousness. Nervousness ' means
anaemia of the nerve centers. This Is
brought about either by Impure Mood or
overtaxing the nerve centers. Regular
habits, good digestion and careful avoid-
ance of all excesses, will cure nervous-
ness. In order to secure these most de-s
sirable .things Peruna will be found to r>Â«
of great assistance. It assists digestion,^"

She speaks of It In the following glowins

Gentlemen â "I cannot give too great
praise to Peruna. Last winter my ner-
vous system became so overtaxed from
constant overwork with my violin that
my right side seemed partially paralyzed.
"X naturally became very anxious and
consulted my physician. After giving me
a couple of prescriptions without effect,
he advised me to try Peruna, and I am
glad to say It effected a speedy and per-
manent cure.
A dose .of Peruna before each meal
during the hot season Is a safeguard of
priceless value. Catarrh cannot be
cured by local treatment. A thorough
course of internal treatment with Peruna
affords the only reasonable prospect of
cure. Sprays, douches, inhalants and
In such cases local treatment can do
nothing but harm. Peruna has again
and again been found of great value in
these cases. The first dose gives prompt
relief to the most distressing symptoms,
and a persistent use of it for a reasonable
length of time will permanently cure
cases of long standing.
Besides the usual symptoms of catarrh,
the patient has brown specks before his
eyes, slight dizziness, roaring in the
ears, attacks of nervous headache, pal-
pitation of the heart, flashes of heat,
followed by slight, chilly sensations, faint-
ness, depression, despondency, forebod-
ings, foolish fears and many other similar
ones.
The symptoms of catarrhal debility are:
A ilabby, pale condition of the mucous
surfaces, with a sticky, stringy mucous
secretion, which causes much hawking or
coughing, coated tongue, white specks in
the hack part of the throat and a very
red, ragged appearance of tho tonsils.
"/ have used Peruna and can
cheerfully recommend it as being
the best remedy for catarrh and
general debility that / have ever
used." Yours gratefully,
Mrs. C. H. Buck.

ing, the money till In the office was
'".touched" for the entire contents, some

for some time. Then he was sure that he
had been made the victim of a "sure-thing
game."
Just about 4 o'clock a stranger brought
in a drunken man who had $12 to deposit.
Johnson stowed this money safely away
in the till and gave the inebriate a receipt
for it. The other man stood by and
watched and then departed. Soon after a
short, thick-set man, a blonde, came in
and asked to be taken to a cheap room
Johnson went to an upper floor with
him, leaving the office alone. Some min
utes were consumed in reaching the room

this interval that the till was robbed
Johnson's theory la that the sober 'man
of the first two went out and sent up a
pal to clear the coast to furnish an oppor

This opinion is confirmed by the fact that
the last lodger came downstairs almost
immediately and went out "to get a flask
of whisky," but failed to return. He prob

LOS AN'GKLES, Aug. 25.â The necessary
documents have been signed, sealed and
delivered, the money has been paid over
and Senator "W. A. Clark's purchase of a
controlling: interest in the Terminal Is
now a legal fact.
All of the parties to the Important
transaction will from now on devote their
energies toward the realization of the Im
portant object in view, which is the con
struction of a transcontinental road be
tween Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.
Just how much of the interest the Clarka
really own in the Terminal has not been
made public.
Those best conversant with the facts,
however, are saying that Senator Clark,
with Immense Â¦wealth at his command,
would probably not have dipped into the
enterprise at all unless he was placed in
a position to control it absolutely.
The details of the construction of the
new line have been completed. A cor
poration is to be formed with capital suf
licient to complete the line. Papers for
this purpose have already been prepared
and were submitted to Senator Clark dur
ing his last visit to Los Angeles. The
road will issue stock and be bonded, the
latter securities carrying 4 per cent In
terest coupons. Five hundred thousand
dollars of stock and as much more of tho
bonds of the company are to be turned
over for subscription to the people of this
city, and probably half cf the same
amount to the people of Utah, who are
to be equally benefited. Senator Clark
is not expected to be In Los Angeles agaiu
before next winter.
Within the next few days Vice Presi
dent T. E. Gibson of the Terminal road
expects to visit Salt Lake City, there to
confer with citizens relative to the con
struction of the new railroad between Los
Angeles and the capital of Utah.
Reconnoitering parties will soon be put
Into the field to make some preliminary
surveys of available lines. Engineer Haw
good is now organizing a field force lor

be used in formulating future plans for
actual construction.

so alarming that a party was sent out to

fires were spreading rapidly and reaching

Everything at the time was dry and

its fairest and sweetest proportions. In
childless homes the kiss of wife and
h-.:sband groTVS formal, and presently is
neglected ; the springs of love in the
heart become choked for -want of use
and exercise. Childlessness is a j^reat
sorrow to many v.omen. It is like a
curs- from Nature, who bids all crea-
tures to be fruitful. It is not a curse
but a misfortune. Often the conditions
which csuse childlessness are removable.

brought joy to many a woman by Riving

gives to the womanly organs vigor and

practically does away with the pains and

necessity cf being compelled to go often
during the day, and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the extra-
ordinary effect cf Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its won-
derful cures cf the mos; distressing cases.

Syecial Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 25.-The State
Agricultural Society to-day decided to ac
cept the bid of W. D. Fitzgerald of San
Francisco and B. W. Cavanaugh of this
city of $12,000 for the bookmaklng privi
leges at the racetrack during the coming
State Fair.
Fitzgerald and Cavanaugh, on behalf of
three other bookmakers of the State,
guaranteed that the latter would also be
here next month. Under this bid any
bookmaker in the State, up to September
1, can "cut in" and run a book upon pay
ing a pro rata of the sum bid.
The society will conduct its- own auc
tion pool selling. It concluded to do so
for the purpose of preventing a combina
tion of the bookmakers and the auction
men.
The society accepted the renunciation of
Senator Frank W. Leavltt of the privi
lege of the track programme. He had
agreed to pay $500 lor the privilege, and
gave as his reason for desiring to be re
lieved of the privilege that tie understood
that the society had adopted one of the
ruies of last year to the effect that the
entries of the following day would be
closed at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. He
claimed that under those conditions he
would come out loser should he furnish
the speed programmes. The society will
furnish its own programme.
A petition was received from Charles M.
Daniels for reinstatement. He was ruled
off the track In September, 1896, for the
alleged pulling of Mainstay in a race. It
developed that the horse and his trainer
ha\ - e since been reinstated. The boy In
sisted that he was free from any fraud.
He was reinstated. Director Terry voted
against reinstatement upon the ground
that the matter should be further inves
tigated. He gave riotice of reconsidera
tion at the next meetnlg.
Harry Cassldy of the Rancho del Paso
was elected marshal of the racetrack.
A special purse of J6J0, free entrance, to
bo paced September 12, was offered for
Clipper. Little Thorn. Kelly Briggs and
such other pacers as may be entered.
The purse will be divided as follows:
Four hundred dollars for ihe first horse
and $200 for the second, the race to be
conditional on Clipper, Little Thorn and
one other contestant starting. On motion
of Director Terry It was decided that the
owner of every pacer in this race will
be required to pay an entrance fee of $10.
The entrance money will be added to first
money and go to the winning horse.
The Society Will Conduct the Auc
tion Pool Selling and Will Also
Provide the Daily Track

political situation almost on the eve of
the State conventions 13 much mixed. Th*
leadtnR candidates for Governor axe John
R. Rogers and Charles Voorhees. While
A. \V. Fawcett of Pierce County has no:
formally withdrawn from the race, it ia
understood that his failure to do so is a
desire to hold together his supporters la
the hope that their united strength will
go to some other candidate and against
Governor Rogers. Many delegates iaro
talking James Hamilton Lewis, but he in
pronounced in hla declaration that he is
not a candidate and would not accept the
nomination.
To-day (iovernor Rogers seemed to be
the leading candidate, and his supporters
and managers say they are satisfied ho
will be nominated. To-night, however,
the opposition to Rogers' slate seems to
be uniting on Voorheea. He la opposed by
Senator Turner, but seems to be In hign
favor elsewhere.
It is about conceded that Oovernor Rog
ers has a majority of the Democratic
convention. The Populists seem bitter m
their opposition to him and there Is much
talk that If he is successful an Innepen
, dent ticket will be in the fteld. The Rogers
people answer by saying they will be will
ing if necessary to have their favorite
head a straight Democratic ticket

"WASHINGTON, Aug. 25.â Having

Todd, U. S. N., director of the nautical al
manac, retires to-day from active scien
tific -work as the head of the naval ob
servatory, one of the most scientific posts
under the Government. He will be suc
ceeded by Professor F. J. Brown, the as
tronomical director of the observatory.
Professor Todd was grauated at the
naval academy. He served for two years
under Captain Dupont in Chinese waters
and was present at the attack on the
Taku forts in 1S3S, and at Tientsin when
the treaty was signed. He was next or
dered to duty on the coast of Africa, ana
took part in the capturing of the slaver
Erie with 197 slaves on board.

The present Bishop of Louisville, Dr.
William McCloskey, was for many years

therefore has decided views on the diffi

this question have prompted him to sup
port Father Bouchet's attitude asrainst
paying extreme honors to King Humbert's
memory is not known, but the fact that
he sustained his Vicar General's conten
tion leads many Italians to infer so. Arch
bishop Martlnelli enjoys the right in the
country of disciplining any priest or pre
late for breach of duty, but since the pres

of the moral law it is evident that neither

made two speeches here to-day, one of
them in the afternoon and tho other In

a rude platform, of which the boughs of
the tine trees of the park were the only
covering. Thi.* stand fated a rather steep
hillside upon which the people stood and
6at, the increasing elevation lending to
the place the general effect of a huqe
theater.
In the afternoon meeting Mr. Bryan
Â¦was preceded by Webster Davis and
James R. Sovereign. He was not heard
until after 4 o'clock and he spoke briefly.
He devoted himself to a considerable ex
tent to State politics, urping the fusion
forces of tbÂ¥ State to make sure of the
success not only of the electorial ticket,
but of the menj'oers /if Congress, United
fcLates Seiiaiors and "the State ticket as
well. Mr. Uryan said In part:

in thi* country Â«s that the people may not I
carefully study and fully understand ihe
questions upon which they are voting; for
ther* is a partisanship that i^ too apt to
turn raon away from the truth or to make
them refuse to listen to any one except
thosg who bear their own party brand.
We are to-day discussing important ques
tions and it is essential to the welfare of
the rountry that those shall be elected
thfs fail who stand for the policies which
are best for the Government. If Kepubli
c&n policies are right, then thoce who re

for wh'oti our people stand are directly
ELntapor,:stie to the policies for which the
Republican party stands, and bo,th cannot
be right."
He referred to thp Republican policy in
the newly acquired possessions, saying
kmong other things on this point:
"The Republicans say we want a 50
tent doJSar; they have given U3 an S5 per
crnt citizen in Porto Rico."
Referring to the importance of the elec

BRYAN MAKES TWO
SPEECHES AT OMAHA
"Every one would be in a state of
fear. Commercial dullness would suc

and ire would again witness that in
dustrial paralysis which character
ized the years of ? 93 and '98, when
the question of what was to be the
standard agitated the public mind."
"Efftct?." he continued, "would be de
plorable. Nobody would be able to meas
ure accurately the influence upon his ov/11
iiffsirs with f-uch (jovcrnm^nt action.
The Secretary said that the effect
of this would be most disastrous on
the credit of the country. The alarm
that would be caused would lead to
the presentation of greenbacks and
treasury certificates for redemption.
The g-old reserve -would soon be in
vaded, business would be depressed
and industry checked and revenues
of the Government would be much
diminished.
"There would thus be established a cir
cuit of silver out of the treasury into the
hand? of the people, from the people intu
the banks, from the banks into the cus
tom house and into the hands of the col
lectors of internal revenue, and the Gov
ernment, properly speaking, would be on

"The announcement by the Treasury
Department of its purpose to pay silver in
settlement of all interest on the public
debt r.ot specifically payable in gold and
to make its daily disbursements to ita
creditors In silver would stop the inflow
of gold, or at least very largely diminish
the payments in gold and correspondingly
increase the payments into the treasury
of silver and silver certificates. It there
fore might be anticipated that with a
good deal of perverse ingenuity the time
would come at no distant day wnen ail
the revenues of the Government wouki
be paid in silver dollars or silver certiri-
"There is no doubt Mr. Bryan could
order his Secretary of the Treasury to
make payment in silver of all public debts
payable in coin and for all current dis
bursements of the Government as well,
which amount to a million and a half f>
a. million and three-quarter dollars a day.
That he would give such an order, too, is
very certain, if he is of the same mind
that he was in 1S96, for he was quoted as
paying: "If there is any one who believes
that the gold standard is a good thing,
or that it must be maintained, I want
him not to cast his vote for me, because
I promise him it will not be maintained
in the country longer than I am able to

of the Wage Scale. .
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Aug.- 25.â Twenty
thousand packing-house employes in the
big cities of the country may be thrown
out of employment on September 15. The
Cattle Butchers' Union is unable to secure
what they consider an equitable i ad
justment of the wage scale at Kansas
City, and Omaha packers demand a cut
to correspond to the scale at the former
point. This means a reduction of about
$3 per week in wages. The unions em.
ployed in packing-houses are said to be
supporting the butchers.
President Donnelly of the Amalgamated
Meat Cutters and Butchers Workmen of
North American of Omaha has spent con
siderable time here and in Kansas City
recently, preparing the butchers', unions
for the proposed strike.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
California wine properly labeled and properly ad
vertised ought to win in the American market. Our
people are not such fools as to judge wine solely
by the labels. " It is said that a wine which with a
California label sells for 50 cents a bottle can be' sold
for $3 a bottle if labeled St. Julien. The man who
makes the profit is the New York dealer who shifts
the labels. It will certainly be worth while for Cali
fornia winemen to save that amount and a course of
well-placed advertising would probably do it. Good
wine may need a bush, but it should not need a French
label. â¢
The evil of the practice is that it works an injury
to California. It discredits our wine to the extent
of making it difficult to sell it at a fair price under its
own name. The wine that has bcenfalsely labeled ad
vertises France and not California. .It serves to con
tinue the Eastern belief that this State cannot furnish
wine fit for the finest tables in the land. Thus it in
jures us and advances the prestige of our rival at the
same time.
Just how to remedy the wrong is not clear. It is
said the Eastern people will not buy California wine
labeled as such and since there is no way to force it
upon them it is nothing more nor less than good busi
ness sense to adapt ourselves to the demands of the
market. There is, of course, good ground for that as
sertion, but on the other hand it has been proven over
and over again that if a people will hold to the path
of straight honesty in commercial matters it will
win in the long run. American beers bore German
labels or names for a long time, and then there was
no repute for them; but of late a considerable num
ber of breweries have made a reputation for their
own brands and now some of those brands are sold in
Germany itself.- Why should it not be the same with
wine?
OUR WINE flND FRENCH LABELS.
A PRETTY study for the exercise of debating
societies is to be found in the practice which
prevails to such an enormous extent of selling
California wine under French labels. The pros and
cons of the subject are many. Is it dishonest to sell
good wine under a false label? If a customer prefers
that label and is willing to pay for it. has he not a
right to it?
HIGHER educatioon in California is advancing
by leaps and bounds. The number of students
seeking admission to the State University in
creases so rapidly that the provision made for them
at any one year becomes utterly inadequate for those
who apply at the next. University extension in a dif
ferent sense from that in which it is ordinarily used
has therefore become a paramount issue at Berkeley.
It is nota question of sending forth the faculty to carry
university aspirations to the outer world, but of pro
viding for the housing and the instruction of those
who throng to Berkeley itself.
In the freshman class this year there are 650 stu
dents and in the higher classes there are larger num
bers than before. The increase in the number of
students over that of last year is nearly 400 and the
total attendance this year upon those colleges and de
partments of the university established in Berkeley is
in the neighborhood of 2.300. That is a notable mem
bership. It would reflect credit upon any university
of the oldest and most populous States in the Union.
In a commonwealth so young as California it is a
record of which to be proud.
Before we make too much noise in the way of
boasting of the increased attendance, however, we"
must provide adequately for supplying the require
ments of a university with so large a population.
There are serious needs at Berkeley for nearly all
kinds of university buildings. To that subject the
alumni, the Native Sons, candidates for the Legisla
ture and munificent citizens should give attention.
There is ample room for each and all to do some
thing. Liberal appropriations from the State and
liberal contributions from private munificence can all
be wisely and economically used at Berkeley just now.
A people rich enough to send so many young men
and women to seek a university education should be
rich enough to provide accommodations for them
when they reach there.

The importance of the issue lies in the determina
tion of decent Republicans not to submit to boss domi
nation nor to vote for the tools of bosses as represen
tatives of the Republican party. A convention con
trolled by the better dements of the party can name a
winning ticket, but a convention dominated by Her-
Tin, Crimmins and Kelly can do no more than dis
grace the party and lead it to defeat. Men of the type
of Dibble and Wolfe will not be supported by good
Republicans, even if they be nominated. The issue is
tip to the returning board. The gentlemen who com
pose it have the right to count and are expected to
count right. They must make no compromise with
corruption.
Thus there rests upon the returning board the re
sponsibility of hearing all the evidence that can be
brought forward by either side and gathering from it
the truth of the situation. Nothing should be done
hastily. Nothing should be done unfairly. In a full
investigation made with justice to all honesty will win
more than corruption and therefore it has no need to
appeal to prejudice or to ask snap judgment upon any
point of controversy. Decent Republicans expect the
returning board to prevent Herrin, Crimmins and
Kelly from profiting by their frauds, but they do not
expect the board to deprive the conspirators of d
single vote that was fairly cast for their tickets.
Of course, decent Republicans cannot and will not
consent to surrender their rights to such domination
as that. They will not submit to a convention whose
members obtained office by cheating, repeating and
ballot-box smashing. The loafers and hoodlums of
the slums, rounded up by the Democratic bosses as
well as by those who pose as Republicans, cannot be
permitted to take control of the Republican party of
San Francisco, elect tools of the Southern Pacific
Company to the county convention and through them
name the candidates of the party who are to represent
Republicanism in the coming campaign.
Ample evidence can be furnished of frauds com
mitted by the tools cf Herrin, Crimmins and Kelly.
It can be shown that among their supporters were
the rounders of both the Republican and the Demo
cratic camps, that many of these men voted many times
and that their repeating was frequently done so
openly and boldly that the election managers of the
bosses could not even pretend ignorance of it. In
some instances where the bosses knew they had been
outvoted, in spite of all their tricks, the ballot boxes
were broken and fraudulent ballots mixed with the
good.
The returning board represents the Republican or
ganization of the city. It should be impartial, honest
and fearless. It has to perform a duty at once im T
portant and difficult. It has to give to the bosses
all that is due to them, but it has also to give full
measure of justice to those who at the primaries up
bield the honor and the integrity of the party. To un
tangle the rights and the wrongs of the opposing
parties is going to be a perplexing task, but it can
be done if the board adopt right principles and follow
them unswervingly from start to finish.

disreputable elements of society perpetrated at the
elections about every form of trickery, fraud and vio
lence known to the worst class of American poli

concerned.
Â£RÂ£UbS fIT THE PRIMARIES.
Let The Call publish the names given
by each Judge last January and the names
of the members of the Grand Jury now in
session and let the readers of The" Call
judge for themselves. At the same time
The Call might publish the membership
of each of the grand juries that have been
selected in this city during the past ten
years. Such a publication by repeating
the names of certain persons who have
proved themselves serviceable on so many
grand juries would expose the corrupt
ring which has controlled our courts and
city for so many years.
Why should the Grand Jury system,
which possesses so much power of good,
be stigamatized as a failure when the
human instruments appointed to carry on
its work are failures? Rather, should
not the Judges who appoint notoriously
corrupt and improper persons to serve as
grand jurors be denounced as failures?
Can any citizen safely trust his life and
property to the decision of Judges who
prove themselves so unworthy of the con
fidence of the community?
E. P. E. TROY.
San Francisco, Aug. 25, 1900.
A few of the Judges whose honesty
shines as the brightest star of hope of
suppliants at the bar of justice name only
citizens who have the confidence of all
who know them; and even the Judges who
name the most objectionable characters
sprinkle their lists with good citizens. But
are such names drawn for the Grand
Jury? Only a small minority.
keepers of notorious saloons that cater to
the vilest and most degraded element's of
the community; men of wealth who re
present the corporations controlling the
public utilities of the city, and whom
dame rumor charges most plainly with
corrupting our public officials and besides
produces every moral evidence to sub
stantiate this charge; pawnbrokers and
money-lenders, whose business is at the
mercy of the public officials they are
charged to investigate; notorious follow
ers of certain scoundrels known as poli
tical bosses, whose sole business Is cor
rupting the body politic. On one list there
were not only two ex-Supervisorial chat
tels of a corrupt political boss, but also
the boss' brother-in-law; and the proprie
tor of a notorious place.
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
- â¢ have as communications of general Interest.
Editor Call: Your editorial of to-day
upon "The Grand Jury System" Is one
that deserves the serious attention of this
community. If the Grand Jury in other
States springs from the same source as
it does in our city, there should be no dif
ficulty In locating the disease which af
flicts it. . Here in San Francisco the
trouble is, plainly, with a few shining
exceptions, the corrupt condition of our
judicial officers. . The Grand Jury has
duties to perform, and powers granted it,
which are unquestionably of benefit to
the State.
The question of secrecy is one that
offers grounds for dispute, but it does
not touch the main issue. Of late years
it has become fashionable in certain cir
cles in this country to question the utility
of various of its institutions. Xot only
do we hear this belittlement of the Grand
Jury, but even the petitâ the triai jury
has* been attacked and suggestions made
that it be abolished and the question of
fact as well as of law be left to the decis
ion of a judge. We are told that we are
outgrowing the Constitution and that the
right of self-government is an old-fogy
notion. In fact if the advice of our critics
be accepted, every bulwark of the insti
tutions of our country which shelters the
liberties of the people will be soon wiped
away.
Let us examine our Grand Jury system
In San Francisco. In the month of Janu
ary of every year each of the twelve
Superior Judges In this county selects
twelve persons whose names are put into
a box and, when the presiding Judge di
rects, the County Clerk draws from these
144 names sufficient to complete the Grand
Jury. Can the jury be any better than
its source? Whom do the Judges select?
In the list submitted last January I found
ex-members of the Board of Supervisors
who, while on that board, rained most
notorious reputations for corruption;
"Why should, the Grand Jury system, which pos
sesses so much poiver of good, be stigmatized as a fail
ure when the human instruments appointed to carry on
its ivorlc are failures?" â JE. P. E. Troy.

in turn sold them to the United States

W. Lovell and the United States Book

waters might cease from troubling and
might be forever at rest. At last a spe

but entirely legal way has not only
soothed down John W. Lovell and the

absorbed them and all their works, good,

(indifferent good) is the copyright of "The
Little Minister," which the said Publish

been illegally dramatized by Mr. Barrie,
he, the said Barrie, having no more pro
prietary rights to said "Little Minister"
(as the said plaintiffs claim) than has

Time was when the church was te"acher
and the stage pupil; their positions are
now reversed. The stage now attacks
problems, moral and immoral, more ef
fectively than dees the church; a favorite
actor enjoys a social position more distin
guished than that of a Bishop, and may
not unfairly be said to rank with an Arch
bishop, or even with a brigadier general.
Many modern churches are built with a
semi-circular auditorium In imitation of
that of the theater. Parsons take lessons
from actors In elocution, and even Invite
actors (such as Mr. Herne) to preach in
their churches. But the crowning gift of
the stage to the church Is the roof gar
den, which has been adopted by the Cen
tral Christian Church of Columbus, Ind.
Says the Dramatic Mirror:
"The garden is roofed over and storm
shutters are available in case of need.
There is a movable stageâ 'platform* it is
called, presumably to appease conserva
tive and old-fashioned members of the
congregation â and the garden is used in
warm weather for 'services, social gather
ings and concerts.'
"The novelty of the plan has excited
imitation In other cities, and churches
both in St. Louis and Chicago already
have begun work on similar lines. It la
not likely that the entertainment provided
by the projectors of this new style of roof
resort can be less interesting than that
now furnished in the regular professional
establishments, and it will possess the ad
ditional attraction of free admission."

Munsey's Magazine for August contains
a well written forecast of the New York

if the managers were discounting the bad
business that invariably accompanies the^
turmoil' of a Presidential election; they
know that boys under 23 would rather
walk in a torchlight procession than go to
the theater, and if the boys don't go to
the theater the girls can't go either. Why,
then, provide expensive entertainments, to
which people won't turn out, when cheap
ones will just as effectively catch what
business Is a.-golng? Verily, the manager

of permanent value to our stage.
"The tendency of both press and pub
lic," our author declares, is to discrimi
nate against native plays and in favor of
foreign. 'Cyrano de Bergerac' is a
wonderful piece of work and In its right
place â on the French stage, in the French
language â no one admires it more than I
do. But it sickened me to see all America
crowding to see it, while a noble and mov
ing American drama, like James A.
Herne's 'Griffith Davenport,' was played
to the most meager houses.**
THE CALL has recently undergone a libel suit
for a quarter of a million dollars in a case
in which it had sought to defend society against
the type of a class that preys upon it. Our motive
was stated at the time, to be solely a desire to protect
the innocent from unspeakable sorrow and degrada
tion. We took the -most searching and extraordinary
precautions to verify every word that we published,
and even hesitated in the publication, in the hope
that knowledge of the existence of the evidence
would deter the party concerned.
This proving insufficient, the publication was made,
not with the view to sensation, which we abhor, but
to warn all raiders on the innocence and peace of
families that their trail could be traced and their ex
posure effected. Women are susceptible of abuse
through their affections, and " these, in men and
women, are not often under the control of reason.
The cold-hearted simulator has always found there a
field for either the filling of his pockets or the grati
fication of his lusts. Perhaps society has no greater
enemy than this class. When their arts breach the
walls of reserve which protect it there is no limit to
the exploiting of their designs. The results are told
in broken hearts and blighted lives.
As we have denned the place of a newspaper, it is
a member of the social state, with no lower function
in morals than the pulpit itself, and through its su
perior command of publicity, with a greater power for
usefulness, provided it be controlled by purity and
courage.
In the case now concluded by the verdict of a jury
we acted upon that belief in the rights and duties of
the press, taking the responsibility and proceeding
with the greatest caution. A rule of law, salutary in
its purpose, deprived us of the direct testimony of the
witness whose knowledge of the facts was the greatest,
and who had broken open the grave in which her
sorry experience was buried, to give us the story that
saved an innocent member of her sex from a fate
probably even worse than her own.
To her is due the honor and respect of men and
women. Herself the victim of wiles plied with match
less art, and a grievous sufferer, to go over the tragedy
of her life was another martyrdom, but she accepted
it with resignation, unselfishly to save another. Her
courage and sense of duty should impress others in
! like circumstances, to the end that the ravages of these
: beasts of prey may be limited to the destruction of
their first victim.
Some incidents of the trial are of peculiar interest
to San Francisco. The attempt of an attorney to
save his client by the bold declaration that, if all tarred
with the same stick were barred out of society the
clubs and churches of San Francisco would be de
populated, is either true or untrue. If approximately
true, it only serves to emphasize the need of a news
paper that will deal with that line of social offenses
with a clean pen, but in a fearless spirit.
It is not what its author intended it to be, a defense
of his client, but an indorsement of the press and
pulpit which will dare to enter such a field as he de
scribed and purify it by timely and truthful exposure.
We do not need ~o say that the charge may also
serve to advertise to the free ranger in immorality
that here is the place for him to thrive. But we warn
all who take it in that sense that they will find The
Call undismayed by libel suits and threats of personal
reprisal and ready to do its duty to a community
that contains as large a proportion of pure homes and
upright lives as any in the world.
The verdict of a jury, hampered as it is by the im
position of every possible legal technicality, vindicates
us in this view of our duty and protects us in its dis
charge. The award of one cent to a plaintiff, who did
not venture to testify in his own defense, is a very
small patch on a character that he regarded as worth
$255,000, the sum for which he sued. When such as
he are forced to submit themselves to the judgment
of a jury which represents the instinctive decency of
this community, and is mindful of its oath and the re
lation thereto of its social duty, just that same dis
count of $254,099 09 may be expected to be the result.
1 Th|E PENNY VERDICT.
It is important that the courts should be protected
in the honest discharge of their duty. Not even an
editor with a grievance should be permitted to abuse
them under cover of his acknowledged privilege to
criticize and correct. The editor of the Mail was
never punished for what he did as Harbor Commis
sioner. He should be thankful for that and hold his
tongue.
In this instance he abuses Belcher because the latter
made an imperishable record of his misdoings
and in the discharge of his duty denounced him.
To give currency to such articles without the accom
panying reasons for their publication tends to degrade
the press. We say this <or the benefit of the editor
of the Mail as well as for the benefit of other journal
ists who may be tempted to wreak their vengeance
upon judicial officers who expose them.
We do not wish to be understood as objecting to
the efforts of the editor of the Mail at this time to get
"even." Judge Belcher will probably be a candidate
to succeed himself at the coming election and un
doubtedly he anticipates meeting opposition from
many litigants who have been disappointed at the re
sults of their rascality as presented to his court. But
we submit that in exhibiting his particular wounds
the editor of the Mail, as a journalist and the trustee
of a public trust, should append to his lampoons of
judicial officers an explanation of the sources of his
spleen. *
During April, 1898, Judge Belcher had before him
two cases, viz.: Irving vs. the Board of State Harbor
Commisioners and the Paraftine Paint Company vs.
the same defendant, one being for an injunction
to prevent the Commissioners from awarding a con
tract and the other being for a mandamus to compel
them to award the contract to the lowest bidder.
Both involved the proper conduct of the business of
the Harbor Commission, of which the editor of the
Mail wai then president. Considerable testimony
was taken at the trial, a synopsis of which was pub
lished in The Call ;it the time, and in deciding the
cases Judge Belcher handed down a long opinion. It
should be unnecessary, in view of what has already
been said, to add that in his decision the court re
flected severely upon the editor of the Mail. lie
found that the editor in question had bee^n running
the Harbor Commission in the interest of |i few con
tractors and politicians and against the interests of
the State, and he said so in unmistakable terms.
As the critique of the Mail is intended for a lam
poon, we are compelled to inquire into the cause of it.
We trust our contemporary will pardon us for looking
between its lines, since we do so in the interests of
honest journalism and not for the purpose of defend
ing Judge Belcher. That jurist, indeed, needs no de
fense in such a matter.
We are not called upon at present to comment at
large upon Judge Belcher's view of this "problem,"
but it seems to us that it is eminently rational and
worthy of consideration. The publication of the
article, however, appears to have given particular of
fense to the Stockton Mail. The editor of that jour
nal is unable to understand why Judge Belcher should
have obtruded himself into the subject; nor why he
should have conceived his opinion worth publishing;
nor where he obtained the idea that anybody cares
what he thinks on any matter of current interest:
nor, in short, why he should vex the public eye and
offend the public ear with his opinions, either on
ethical or political subjects.
TO a recent number of the Merchants' Associa
tion Review Judge Belcher of the Superior
Court of this city contributed an article in which
he discussed the future policy of the United States
with reference to its new insular possessions. The
question presented by the writer was whether or not
it will ultimately become necessary to admit the Fili
pinos and Porto Ricans to the privileges of American
citizenship. It is Judge Belcher's idea that the
present status of these people will have to be main
tained and he suggests that before any of the islands
are admitted to the family of States, even as Terri
tories, it should be settled that American citzenship
for their inhabitants will be conferred only on condi
tions.

The success of the blastophaga at Fres
no has been so marked that the Fresno
papers have recently been publishing long
accounts, appreciating the significance of
the fact. When the wasp survived the
winter, much -was expected, but the ex
periment was not thought complete until
the wasp began its toll of fertilizing the
native fig, which insures Its ripening ful
ly.' Now the blastophaga is working as
industriously as upon its native heath.
In late years the Improved methods of
packing have popularized the California
product, but the Smyrna fruit has been
imported to San Francisco by the carload
The extent of the heldover Smyrnas in*
boxes is not definitely known here, but it
is not large enough to affect the situa
tion materially.
Rumors of this embargo came over the
wires in press dispatches a few days ago',
but they were doubted. Now their ac
curacy has been officially affirmed. If
any Smyrna figs should be shipped they
will be dumped into New York Bay upon
arrival. The first effect of the news is
an increase in the prices for California
figs. Ten-pound boxes at Fresno have al
ready advanced 10 cents. In the packing
boxes the price has been raised from 2
cents to 3 cents per pound. There is a de
mand for all the crop.
California will eupply the people of the
United States with all the new crop of
figs they have this year. Ultimately Cali
fornia will be able to produce all the figs
that the world will require, for the blaa
tophaga, or fig wasp, brought to Fresno
in numbers In Capri figs to fertilize the
native fig, has proved to bo a success. It
is therefore only -a matter of a few years
when this State will be as noted for Its
"Smyrna" figs as It now Is for its raisins.
Just now the exclusive control of the

SWORDFISH AND
WHALE IN BATTLE
THE few men aboard the tug
Yosemite, which runs between
this city and Fort Baker for
the accommodation of United
States engineers, witnessed a ter
rific battle between a whale and a
ewordfish about 2:30 o'clock yester
day afternoon. The fight took place
about midway between Sausallto
and Fort Baker and lasted fully
two minutes. Captain P. M. Stofen
of the Yosemite says he never saw
anything that equaled yesterday's
encounter.
"I believe the swordflsh had been
chasing that whale ever since Fri
day night," Bald the captain in tell
ing the story. "Some of the boys
hea'rd a great disturbance in the
water during the night, but were
unable to ascertain the cause. On
our way to Fort Baker this morn
ing we saw a monster Â¦whale leap
entirely out of the water, a- thing
which they rarely do except when
attacked.
"At about 2:30 o'clock this after
noon we s=aw the whale again. He
was 200 yards ahead of us. The
monster raised himself completely
out of the water. After he had
gone under there was a great ruf
fling of the water, followed by a
fountalnlike spray, which went high
in the air. I believe this was the
whale's death struggle, for we did
not see him after that. We got
several good glimpses of the sword
fish, particularly when the whale
jumped into the air. The fish al
ways attacks from underneath,
bringing its sword Into play against
the whale's stomach. A hammerflsh
was also seen in the vicinity, and I
think he helped to finish the
whale."
Captain Stofen says the whale
was fully forty feet long and the
swordflsh was of extra large size.

A San Francisco company has begun to
develop the Monitor quartz mine, six
miles south of Shingle Springs, El Do
rado County.
From the same source the following
facts are taken: Failure to secure elec
tric power has caused a reduction of the
force at the Harvard mine. The San
Guiseppe will be reopened. The Kanaka
mine, near Groveland. will start up soon.
The Santa Isabel will be unwatered and
subjected to expert examination.
Despite the confident prediction of winter
prophets that the abundance of snow in the
mountains would kpep the stamps of our mills
dropping the year round, the water supply is
rapidly diminishing and In a few weeks many
mines will not be able to obtain enough to wet
their batteries. The water company has com
menced to draw on the reserve supply con
tained in its system of dams, and this will be
completely exhausted by September 1. Then the
mine-owners will be obliged to struggle alone
as best they can until the rainy season ar
rives.
Good discoveries near Little Antelope,

An agreement concerning the price of
lead would seem to have been reached by

The Salt Lake Tribune has interviewed
T R. Jones, district manager for the
American Smelting and Retining Com

In the foregoing. The Tribune says "the
producers generally view the price as a
reasonable medium between the ex

The Lower Colorado will have two
smelters. One is ready to operate at
Needles. The second will be placed at
Empire Flats, forty-five miles below
Needles, on the Arizona side, three miles
from the river. Boston men are back of
the Empire Flats enterprise.
Expert slate workers have been brought
by the Eureka slate quarry management,
in the Kelsey district, El Dorado County,
from Pennsylvania. New machinery has
been installed and many Improvements
are in view. Warren Crocker, operating;
the Lily Emma Copper mine near Pilot
Hill under bond, has shipped 180 pounds
of ore to the State Mining Bureau as a
county exhibit. Hayward & Lane are the
purchasers of the Tin Cup mine. The
news is confirmed. They will develop the
property fully. The Gold Queen quartz
mine, in the Kelsey district, has been pur
chased by Philip C. Stlngle and John
Laughry.
The Scott Valley Advance reports that
the Yellow Rose of Texas mine, located
near the headwaters of the South Fork of
the Salmon and lying in both Siskiyou
and Trinity counties, is running full blast,
taking out ore and also developing.
It is well known that. In creating the United
States Geological Survey, Congress and the
people whom it represents expected that Its
energies would be largely devoted to the devel
opment of the mineral resources of the country.
How this method should be accomplished was
left to the director and his principal assistswts.
who, by scientific training and long practical
experience, were the best qualified to- Judge
what could and what could not be done by such
a corps of specialists as the survey must neces
sarily consist of â men whose whole life Is de
voted to the abstract side of geology and whom
neither the regulations of the survey as defined
by law nor the exigencies of their olflcial duties
would permit to participate in the practical or
commercial development of these resources. It
was evident that these specialists could not take
the place of either the prospector or the mining
engineer, as a somewhat superficial view of the
subject has led some to think they might. They
should, of course, understand the principles that
underlie the work of either of these classes of
men, but they can not be expected to possess
that expertness of instinctive second sense in
each of these professions which can be acquired
only by lifelong practice.
The survey should furnish an accurate basis
upon which the work of each of these experts,
so Indispensable in the development of the min
eral resources of the country, may be founded.
It should endeavor to tell the prospector where
he may and where he may not prospect to ad
vantage for this or that valuable mineral, but
it cannot be expected to actually find the min
eral for him. It should aim to discover for
the mining engineer first of all the general laws
which govern the occurrence of the different
useful minerals, and to show the special appli
cations of these laws In the particular mining
regions that come under survey; but it cannot
undertake to direct the workings of individual
mines or quarries, nor guarantee that every
mining engineer will make a correct applica
tion of the laws that have been discovered.
Director TValcott of the United States
Geological Survey reports that topograph
ical maps of. very large areas have been
completed and that in a few cases the
areas have been studied economically.
That is, the manner of occurrence of the
known ore deposits has been observed.
The deductions which tend to guide min
ing prospectors to other deposits will be
carefully considered by scientific miners.
The economic work Is more difficult and
expensive than other branches of geo
logical exploitation. "The increase in ef
fectiveness of this work," writes Director
Walcott, "must proceed slowly. Even
with unlimited amounts of money im
mediately available the economic work
of the survey could not at once be spread
over the whole country, as it should be,
for the reason that it would take time to
train the additional number of specially
prepared geologists required. But there
is no doubt that by a natural enlargement
of the present plan of work the demands
of the mining community for Government
aid in the development of their particular
branch of industry can readily be largely
met."
Speaking of the limitations of Govern
ment work, Director Walcott says:
All Demands Will Be Met in Devel
opment of Plan â Facts From
the Interior Coun
ties.

POLICE THINK
MURDERER HAS
BEEN ARRESTED
Alleged Slayer of Nichols Is
in California Street
Prison.
Thomas Holmes, a Shady Character,
Arrested by Officer J. L. Nel
son at Bush and Kearny
Streets.
Thomas Holmes, a character well known
to the police, was arrested shortly before
midnight last night and placed in the
tanks at the California-street police sta
tion. Policeman J. L. Nelson made tho
arrest at the corner of Kearny and Bush
streets. Holmes Is Â¦ supposed to be the
burglar who shot and killed Special Officer
George F. Nichols In the Star Exchange,
at the corner of Merchant and Sansome
streets, last Thursday night.
Holmes' appearance closely resembles
the description of the shooter as given
both by the murdered man and by Charles
Jackson. The latter was standing on the
corner, and Immediately after the shots
were fired saw the murderer rush out,
pistol In hand, and pass close to him. He
saw the face distinctly and claims that
he would be able to Identify the man ir
he saw him again.
Dan Daley, another suspect. Is now In
the tanks at the City Prison, and the de
tectives are Investigating the case against
him. The officers feel confident that the
other two burglars, Marlon and Cox, haa
nothing to do with the murder.

Will Be Nominated by Republicans
to Hepr^esent Eleventh District.
The Republican primary election in Ma
rln County ycuterday resulted in the elec
tion of delegates favorable to the nomina
tion of Frank L. Coombs for Congress and
C. M. Belshaw for the State Senate. Tho
following delegate?! were chosen:
At larg<>. Judpo K. M. Ansrellotti; First Dis
trict. William Barr: Heconil IMstrlct, Thomas
P. I?oyd: Third District. Fred K. Harmon;
Fourth District, R. D. Hatch; Fifth District,
Georxe E. Mason.
In tho Kleventh Senatorial District, em
bracing the counties of Contra Costa and
Marln. C. M. Belshaw receives 250 ma
jority over James Rankln. In the Assem
bly Mr. Belshaw made an excellent rec
ord. He defended the interests of his con
stituents on oJl occasions and was known
as a man who would not take orders from
the bosses or corporations.
. An ugly light was put up yesterday to
prevent the election of delegates favorable
to his nomination for the State- 'Senate.
He did not stay at home ar.d complain
that the people were ungrateful, but went
out and made an open light for the nom
ination and won out handsomely. .
Little Girl Injured.

at 240 Natoma street, was knocked down
by .a horse driven by George Hart, book
keeper for Farnsworth & Ruggles, dray

evening and had her head badly cut. Tht
injured child was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where she was treated; Hart
was arrested and charged with battery.
RETURNS FROM
EIGHT DISTRICTS
AT SHIELS HALL
Republican Returning Board
Stands Ready to Render
Impartial Judgment.
AFFAIRS pertaining to the Repub.
lican contest in San Francisco
are unchanged. The bolters rep
resenting- the Kelly-Crimmins
boss element of the party are still
holding out at Shiels Hall the returns
from eight districts and one precinct of
another district. In sending the returns
to a place other than that designated in
the official call for the primary election
the election , officers were guided by the
advice of vicious and inexperienced poli
ticians. Xo doubt the election officers
who took the advice did not want to sena
the record to an honest canvassing board
until they had opportunity to fix things
and make- the tables correspond, with the
number of ballots reported as having been
cast.
It was also perceived that it would be
necessary to check up the printed register
in order to secure obvious proof of fraud.
These and other considerations impelled
the boss polltic?ans to advise against
sending, the records to" the canvassing
board appointed by the chairman of the
County Committee.
The checkmated bopse3 realizing their
deplorable predicament are turning to the
Republican State Central Committee for
aid and sympathy. They have resolved
tb send their "quarantined" returns to the
State organization along with a statement
of their grievances, and the expression of
a desire to compromise on a basis of re
ferring the whole subject to the members
of the County Committee in their respec
tive districts.
Before the primary election took place
The Call made the statement several
times that the corrupt bosses were plan
ning to stuff and smash ballot-boxes and
produce confusion and discord in order to
establish a pretext for Inviting the State
Committee to interfere in the local affairs
of the party.
Martin Kelly and Phil Crimmins are In
a desperate situation. They are hounded
by hangers-on whom they have promised
to maintain, and have no compensating
patronage to bestow. The prospects of
obtaining money for the ?ale of positions
on the local ticket are not very bright.
The "hopheads" who were hired to re
peat at the polls day before yesterday are
clamoring for stuff. Herrin Is no longer
gifted with unlimited authority to dis
burse money of the Southern Pacific to
corrupt the politics of the State. Kelly is
In need ot* immediate help, henee- his ap
peal to the sympathies of the State Cen
tral Committee.
The returns from eight districts and one
precinct which, are in quarantine at Shiels
Hall awaiting a clean bill of health rep
resent but S8 of the 2oO delegates of the
proposed' local convention. Kelly and
Crimmins cannot do business at the Mint
saloon in the line of selling nominations for
office in San Francisco unless their
strength is augmented, and they look to
the State organization for augmenting
authority.
Will Remember Kelly's Record.
Republicans from interior counties have
representation on the State Central Com
mittee. They will doubtless call to mind
the fact that they once gave, in their re
spective Republican counties of the in
terior, a majority of 12,000 for Hon. M. IÂ»I.
Estee, their candidate for Governor. In
San Francisco Martin Kelly betrayed the
ticket and the majority was overcome and
Mr. Estee defeated.
The Call does not require the services
of a special artist to illustrate the haste
which the Interior Republican's will make
to assist Kolly in this hour of boss des
pair. But Kelly needs help and the situ
ation is rendered extremely urgent by the
fact that Kelly's partner in boss politics
is keeping something other than a saloon.
Returning Board at Work.
The returning board of eighteen held a
short meeting yesterday morning and ad
journed to 3 o'clock in the afternoon. At
that hour the returns and protests were
taken up for consideration.
Contests^ in five Assembly districts had
been filedâ in the Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sev
enth, Thirty-ninth. Fortieth and Forty
lifth. Those contests were read, and a
sub-committee of live was appointed to
take evidence and report to tho returning
board. The committee consists of J. H.
McCarthy.- A. Ruef, J. D. Clark. H. K.
Holmes and II. C. Henderson. Its first
meeting was held last night at the head
quarters of the County Central Commit
tee. It will' proceed with deliberation and
care to hear testimony on both sidos in
each contest. It will demand atlidavits
and will notify precinct election officers
and alleged witnesses of crooked work to
appear before it to testify.
"We shall take plenty of time," T. II.
McCarthy said yesterday afternoon, "and
our recommendations will be bnsod abso
lutely upon the evidence obtainable,
whether it is to the advantage or the dis
advantage of the regular tickets."
Credentials Ordered Issued.
The returning board ordered credentials
F. J. Heney, the attorney, was on the
arjti-Phc-lan ticket, and asked that his fac
tion be allowed a representaxive to watch
tlie count. He -was referred to Tim Fltz

The election as carried out in the Thirtv-
Bevcnth Assembly District last night was
a farce pure and simple. The Phelanites
were the principal actors, and judging
from the work done by those advocates
of "clean polities'! so.ip and water are at
a premium in the district.
The primary was held in a back room
<;f a corner sroccry at iiaiRht and L>evis-

trolled by Harry Zemansky, a deputy
joKit'rar: at least the policemen on duty
had instructions to tako orders lr<.in him.

Among those who watched the arrival
of returns were "Ropey" Maguire of the
organization committee. Supervisor
Braunhart and Attorney M. C. Hassett of
Townsend case fame.
Chairman Curran and Secretary Lynch
of the County Central Committee received
the returns at th3 committee headquar

The club election boards brought the re
turns to the committee in any way that
pleased them. In many instances the bal
lots were brought to headquarters in the
coat pocket of one of the election board.
In other cases the officers neglected en
tirely the formality of bringing in either
ballots or ballot-box.
At Committee Headquarters.
Mr. Ford challenged their right to com
pletely ignore his organization, which is
the oldest and strongest in the district.
Words had no effect, however, and the
Ford crowd then secured a ballot-box
and stationed it in the rear of the saloon
at 440 Turk street. Edward Fogarty took
charge of the voting and he was assisted
by Je^se A. GalUmd and James F. Ford.
It was learned" that a side entrance to
the "500" saloon was being used by
the voters, and as this entrance was
ordered permanently closed some time
ago' by the Police Commissioners, the
violation was reported at headquarters
tind Lieutenant Martin promptly ordered
the passage closed, which was done with
some reluctance. The Ford Club claims

Assembly District. Two Bryan and Ste

The club supposed to have the backing of
the outs opened a polling p!are in the
"i00" ralocn. at the corner of Turk and
Lark:n streets. Three or four soap boxes
piled up In front of a door, the panel of
wbk-h was removed, served as a polling
place. There were live officers on guard
Inside and nearly as many on the outside.
The regular Bryan and Stevenson club,
headed by James T. Kord. had arranged
to manape the polling place, but upon
learning that all arrangements had been
made Ly the other faction it was decided
to visit thÂ«?m and demand representation.
Mr. Ford called personally and requested
permission to examine the ballot-box and

otllcers from his club. Both requests
were promptly refused.

The opposition came prepared and had a
stenographer stationed at the window to
secure evidence of fraud. Ills count show
ed that the total vote was less than 250.
while the returns from the "insiders"
called for 343. Of thvJSP who voted, the
oppositions claim that 173 electors will
make affidavit that they voted against the

108 votes for the opposition. After the

DR. BENNETT'S ELECTRIC BELT
Gives the right kind of a current to cure
these diseases, and I warrant the cure In
every case. If my Belt will not cure you
I do not want your money and will not
sell it to you. I have known for many
years that Electricity was the greatest
curative agent that would ever be known.
I did not like the method of applying
Electricity as taught in colleges and
elaborated upon i in medical books, as
their methods proved a failure general-
ly. Their methods falling was mother
to the invention of my Electric Belt.
They failed, as all other electric belts
and appliances now fail, on account of
the crude electrodes used.
My Belt is the greatest known treat-
ment nnd gives more than four times the
current of other belts and does away
entirely with that frightful burning and
blistering caused hy all others. My Belt
has soft, silken, chamois-covered sponge
electrodes, my exclusive patent, that
make burning and blistering a physical
Impossibility. All other belts have bare [
metal electrodes upon which ver-Tigris
accumulates, and verdigris, being a dead-
ly poison, may produce blood poisoning
and perhaps death. Do not be misled by
concerns placing a thin coating of cham-
ois or felt over "these bare electrodes.
Kloctrlcitv will not ponetrate those cov-
erings, but verdigris will. If mine isn't
best, why do they try to imitate me? Ask
yourself that question. My Belt can be
renewed when burned out for 75c: no
other bolt can be renewed for any price,
and when burned out Is worthless. All
electric belts will in time burn out. My

Out at D. L. Farnsworth's residence.
135 Golden Gate avenue, four doctors are
fighting for the life of the senior member
Ot the firm of Farnsworth & Rusreles.
Last night he was so low that hope for
his recovery was almost abandoned.
Heart disease and complications have
brought Mr. Farnsworth to death's door.
Some time ago his doctor recommended
a rest from business cares, but at that
time he refused to leave. Finally his
condition compelled him to seek a com
plete change and he went down to Cata
lina Island. He did not seem to be much
benefited by the trip, however, and two
weeks ago came back. .
Mr. Farnsworth is an old resident , and
prominent citizen. -Ten years ago he oc
cupied a seat in the Board of Supervisors
and has always played a conspicuous pan
in any movement for public benefit.

Martin received over a hundred answers
to the advertisements. Among the lot was
one written by Albert Wagner, who lives
at 1331 Valencia street. Martin promptly
invited him to call at his hotel. After in
troducing himself as the Pacific Coast

Company of Marion, S. C. Martin en
gaged Wagner to assist him at a salary
of $G0 a month. He demanded that Wag
ner furnish $300 as a guarantee of good
faith offering to refund the amount as
soon 'as Wagner became tired of tho work.
Suspecting that the man was -not a3 he

ment by which Wagner was to become
his employe at a salary of $G0 a month,
and that If he violated any of the terms
of the agreement he wag to lose' the
amount he was to put up as a guarantee
of good faith. \
After the agreement was drawn up
Martin took Wagner to the office of a
Notary Public on Montgomery street,
where they both signed their names to the

Martin seized him \nd vainly struggled
for the possession of the paper. Just then
Detectives Crockett and Dillon, who had
been watching the pair, stepped up and
placed Martin under arrest. He offered
no objection, and was at once taken to
police headquarters. To Captain Sey
mour he said he had recently arrived from
Nome and in proof of this assertion he
exhibited a sack of gold dust.' Despite his
protestations of Innocence he was locked
up in the tanks, pending further investi

tstablisliment of our rrv.ssiors are tc be
determined, and they must be settled un
der the direction of the Bishop. It Is a
delicate and responsible duty, and I go
with a becoming gravity and not with the
greatest hopefulness Imaginable. I hope
I will be aided by the Good Spirit to do
the work properly. The new condition of
affairs there promises more than anything
in the past for the material progress of
China and i the advancement of thfc cause
of Christ. I look for a grand future for
China, however the present troubles may
turn out, and along with that for the
great progress of civilization."
Bishop Moore has a personal letter from
his friend. President William McKinley.
to the military and naval authorities In
China, which he thinks will be of great
aid to him In penetrating the lines and
pursuing his investigations.

A communication was filed yesterday
with the Board of Supervisor?:, signed by
a number of property owners and resi
dents in the vicinity of the stone quarry
and rock-crushing works located at Doug-
lass and Twenty-sixth streets and oper
ated by Gray Bros., in which they state
that they have experienced no special in
convenience, annoyance or injury from
the works. The communication says:
'"The dust complained of by some as
resulting from the operation of the rock
crusher is entirely local and mostly affects
those operating the plant. Any slight in
convenience- or annoyance that has ever
been experienced by us from the blasting
and crushing which has from time to time
been necessary has been overbalanced by
the business it bring? Into the neighbor

Improvement of the streets."
GOOD WORD FOR GRAY
BROTHERS' ROCK-CRUSHER
The eplrit of unrest among the public
6choel teachers was greatly Increased by
the announcement yesterday by Chairman
Mark of the Board of Education that at
lea^t ten more teachers are under inves
tigation by the board. These- teachers
liave been unfavorably reported for var
ious d^ir.qupnck-s by their principals.
Mark savb that no action involving sus
pension or dismissal will be taken by the
beard until after the reports have been
thoroughly 5nve-tiga.ted and the facts
contained therein are verified. The ac
cused teachers will be given an oppor
tunity to make a defense, but It Is be
lievci in feme quarters that they are
practically slated for dismissal. The
charge* include lack of discipline, inat
teaiSon to duty ana inc-fflcitney. The rule
lux.vidir.s for dismissals for physical ln
flnnitles wilt enter into the investigation
and tome teacten may be dropped for
that cause. It is learned from Superin
tendent Webster that Miss M. J. Can
ham cf the Spring Valley Grammar
School is the te:u her who is under sus
pension for deafness.
Superintendent AVebs-ter takes Issue with
Chairman .Mark on the latter's contention
that the board is clothed with the power
of suspending teachers by the provision
cf tli*?' charter which says that it shall
Â«Mab!ish all regulations for the govern
ment and efficiency of the schools. W'eb-
Bter contends that to suspend a teacher
unJc r this provision would be in direct
contravention of the State law. He
quotes a Supreme Court decision which
say? that the rules adopted by the Board
of implication cannot control the provi
sion > of the statute? and are immaterial
In determining the statutory rights of
teachers. According to Webster, if the
board i:ad the risjht to suspend a teacher
the practical effect would be to annul
laws already existing which expressly
provide for the manner in which a teacher
can be relieved from service. In other
vord.s the board could deprive a teacher
Â¦of her means of livelihood without due
process of law.
Superintendent Webster Declares
Th^ir Suspension Would Be in
Direct Contravention of
the State !Law.

A warrant was issued for Miss Simp
son's arrest on the charge of grand lar
ceny a,nd it was served upon her yester
day. She declined to make any statement
till she had consulted her attorney on
Monday.
Her story was so straightforward and
was told with such earnestness that the
police were thrown off the scent. A few
days ago they received information that
Miss Simpson was not so innocent as she
would appctr, and Dettctlve Cody was
placed on the case by Captain Seymour.
Friday a search warrant was obtainea
from Judge Cabaniss to recover several
diamond rings, a turquoise ring, a pean
brooch and other articles, of the value of
$750, which belonged to Mrs. La Roche
ar.d were supposed to be in Miss Simp
son's house at 514 Taylor street. Armed
with the pmrch warrant Cody went to
the house and secured possession of all
the jewelry except one valuable diamond
ring. The nurse had even taken a small
traveling clock.
Miss Simpson attended Mrs. Jeanne Ney
La Roche, who died at the Southerland
House on August L It was at first thought
that Mrs. La Roche's death was not due
to natural causes, but an autopsy showed
that alcoholism was the cause. It was
known that Mrs. La Roche was possessed
of valuable jewelry, but it had mysterious
ly disappeared. Suspicion fell upon Miss
Simpson, but she solemnly declared thai
she knew nothing of the missing gems.
She said Mrs. La Roche had been nursed
by her in June last and had given her a
valuable diamond ring, a turquoise ring
and a golrt watch to care for. It was al
ways her custom to see what valuables
her patients had, so that she could care
for them and return them when leaving.
She next ?aw Mrs. La Roche July 2, and
as she was not wearing any of her Jewelry
she asked her what had become of it, and

Japanese Girl Ends Her First Day's
Work by Accidentally Killing
Herself.
Tome Tanaka, a Japanese girl about 22
years old, was asphyxiated in her bed
last Friday night through ignorance of
the poisonous qualities of illuminating
gas. She went to work as a servant for
Mrs. J. S. McDonald at 840 Halght street
last Friday. She retired in good spirits
at 10 o'clock on Friday evening, after hav
ing made a.11 preparations to start the fire
and resume her household duties in the
morning.
At 2:30 o'clock yesterday morning Mrs.
McDonald was awakened by the suffo
cating odor of ga^, and at once hurried
to the servant's room, where she found
the key of the burner fully turned, on
and the Japanese girl unconscious in bed.
The girl was taken into : the open air.
and Dr. J. M. Williamson, who lives
near by, was summoned hastily, but *he
found that the unfortunate young woman
was beyond all human aid. It is sup
f>osed that, not being accustomed to fl
umJnatlng gas, the girl blew out the Jet
on retiring.

Captain A. W. Kimball, quartermaster
at the Presidio, will leave to-day for Reno,
Nev., and make arrangements for the
shipment of 200 mules, held at that place
under peculiar circumstances. The mules
were sent from the Bast under the charge
of twenty men, and were destined for pack
train service in China. Just a few hours
previous to the arrival of the train carry
ing the animals in Reno one of the team
sters was taken sick. A doctor was sum
moned at the station and he pronounced
the case diphtheria and ordered the twen
ty men quarantined. As a natural conse
quence the cars containing the mules were
sidetracked and word sent to headquar
ters in this city explaining the difficulty.
Captain Kimball was ordered to devise
means of bringing the animals to this city.
Headquarters, band and a battalion of
the Fifth Infantry arrived at the Presidio
yesterday morning. This battalion has
seen particularly hard service, having par
ticipated in a number of engagements in
Cuba, where it has been for two years.
During that time the men passed through
two yellow fever epidemics. To the Fifth
is given the credit of making the city 01

work of remodeling the city's sanitary
condition having all been accomplished' by

Police Commissioners that women who

neighborhood. Abbott promised to put a
stop to the cause of complaint, and on
that promise the license was renewed. He

age for some time to approach men, and
he would beat me. Finally I mustered up
courage, and even then he would beat me
because I did not make enough money.
He started a house of ill fame at 422 Du
pont street and put me there. I remained
there till it was closed by the police, about
three weeks ago. Then I went to live with
him above his saloon. Two weeks ago he
blackened my eyes at the ferry and cut
my lip. He took me to the saloon of a
friend and beat mo again. Since then we
have been constantly quarreling, and last
Tuesday I bought the revolver in. a store
on Third street, as I heard he was going
to give me up because he had sot tired
of me and was paying attention to an
other woman. I was jealous because I
was fascinated with the man. This morn
ing when he struck me and threw me out
of the saloon by the neck I determin-*d to
shoot him, and that is why I did it. I
was born in this city and am 24 years old.

Tocqueville, who attained fame as an
author. This ancestor was the author of

tracted much attention in this country ts
well as in France. The literarr member
of the family also visited this country as
a Commlslsoner from the French Govern
ment to examine the prisons of the United
States. He was active In his opposition
to Napoleon and was a warm, supporter
of the Roman expedition.
Count de Tocqueville will remain here
several weeks to examine various prop

The deceased, .who waa an exceedingly
handsome woman possessed of great so

J. Roche. She also leaves two sisters.
Her family consisted of two sons and
two daughters. The funeral will take
place Monday from the family residence.
The hour has not yet been settled on.
News of her death will come as a shock
to her many friends throughout the State,
to whom her kind disposition and talents
had endeared her. Mrs. Mahoney had

would then be In a position to commit it
self In a resolution.
McCarthy Denied a Hearing.
J. D. McGilvary wanted a committee ap
pointed at once to draw up a set of reso
lutions which would furnish a basis of dis
cussion. He was opposed to asking In any
representative of the Trades Council, but
sug-g-ested that a delegation from the
Millmen's Union might be invited to pre
sent their side of the affair.
James A. Wilson- said -the -Trades Coun
cil never troubled Itself about asking any
of the mill-owners to its meetings, so he
failed to see the logic of inviting any
of the other side to their meeting. Presi
dent McCarthy waa outside, and he sent
in a request for an audience, but it was
refused. As no member of the mill
men's union could be found who waa
willing to speak before the exchange, the
question of hearing their side of the case
was given up.
Mr. McGllvray said the most serious as
pect of the trouble is the threat of the
Trades Council that unless the owncfsi
give in it will institute a sympathetic
strike that would involve all the building
trades in the city. The speaker referred
to the Chicago strike and predicted a
similar status of affairs here unless care
fully guarded against by the employers.
"A.fter a while they will want us to use
the tools that the council may stipulate
and the unions will demand the right to
put in their own foremen and superin
tendents."
The following resolution was offered by
Mr. McGllvray:
Resolved, That the members of the Build
ers' Kxcliance deprecate the methods used by
the Bulldins Trades Council in settling the dis
pute between the 'mill-owners and, the mill
hands; and we believe that the difference
should be adjusted by the employer and em
ploye In their respective trades.
J. E. Britt Bpoke In opposition to the
' resolution, saying in part:
"This resolution accomplishes nothing.
In so far as I can see it leaves the mat
ter right where it Is. We should do some
thing to bring about a settlement. It
seems to me arbitration is necessary.
The eight-hour law is becoming univer
sal. It has been made the law of the
State and it has been made the law of
the United States. The millmen are en
titled to the same hours as the plumb
ers or carpenters or bricklayers."
Believes in Arbitration.
Mr. Wilson spoke in favor of the reso
lution. He said: "All questions and all
quarrels should be adjusted between the
employer and the employe. I am most
decidedly opposed to th<^ labor trust
which has been formed here in San Fran
cisco. On the other hand, I am in sym
pathy with the millmen In their demand
for eight hours. The owners will be able
to survive If the eight-hour schedule is
adopted."
Mr. Wilson closed by reiterating his be
lief that an amicable understanding
could be reached without the aid of the
Trades Council, and incidentally the
speaker scored the council's president
whom he styled as "the man without a
craft who desired to pose as the grand
dictator for all siaes."
Mr. Moore of the Excelsior mills said
the mill-owners could run their shops foi
years to come, despite all boycotts and
interferences by the Trades Council.
"One-third of the business turned out
by the local mills," he said," goes to for
eign ports. No matter what is done I
for one am going to . run my mill as I
choose."
George Gray of Gray Bros, said his
firm had to give in to the eight-hour de
mand, and he saw no reason why the
planing mills should be an exception, to
which Andrew Wilkle replied:
"Prior to July 1 we had our secretary
notify each mill to send him the amouni
of business done for the six months pre
vious to that date. He footed up the to
tals and found that 48 per cent orthe pro*
duct went abroad or was used by others
outside of Trades Council members. Now
are we to allow ourselves to be dominated
by those who only use 52 per cent of our
output? Our business is a manufacturing
industry. If you are going to confine us
to local business you might as well burn
up our mills."
Mr.Chisolm jsaid he was not opposed to
an eight-hour workday, but he waa
against being compelled to do what Mc-
Carthy and others said.
The McGilvary resolution was then
adopted, after which McGilvary moved
the appointment of a committee of five to
confer with the Millmens' Union (ignor
ing the Trades Council), but the, meeting
adjourned without further action.
At a meeting of the associated mill own
ers last night reports were received from
air the members showing an Increase in
the number of men applying for, work., a
number of the mills ore running â¢with full
crews ' and the owners ; are satisfied . It is
only a question of a very short time when
they will have all the men needed, v
The planing mill trouble furnished fuel
for two hours' lively debate at the Build
ers' Exchange on New Montgomery street
yesterday afternoon. The meeting waa a
special one, being called at the request of
ten members of the organization, who de
sired an expression of opinion on the mer
its and demerits of the millmen's demand
for an eight-hour workday. About 200
members were present, nearly every line
of the building trades being represented.
S. H. Kent, president of the exchange,
presided and explained the object of the
meeting.
William Shaughnessy made a statement
in behalf of the mill owners. The first
circular in regard to an eight-hour work
day, he said, was received by the mill
owners from the Millmen's Union last
April.
â¢"They wanted a committee from our or
ganization to meet the Trades Council,"
he said. "We met them, and one of the
propositions offered by the council was
that in the event of the acceptance of the
eight-hour plan the mill owners should
be protected from nine-hour mills outside
the city. But this agreement was broken
a few days later by President McCarthy,
who denied that any such plan had been
agreed to by the council. We then de
cided to have nothing more to do with the
council; that whatever future dealings we
might have with the millmen would be
with their union direct

Bolved itself into the question: Are we

He came toward her threateningly and
told her to go away. As he turned on his

and the bullet entered his back Just below
the left shoulder blade. Abbott was led
into the bar and Dr. A. M. Taylor was
summoned. He probed for the bullet, but
could not find it, and he ordered Abbott's
removal to the Pacific Hospital, Chestnut
and Stockton streets.
The pirl after the shooting walked north

The open stake at Union Park yesterday

in which the favorites more than held
their own. The short ends which were

The" Aeneid Kennels' imported Fine Fire
showed all kinds of speed in the course
with Sleigh Bells and led Glasson's entry
many lengths. The dogs were slipped to
a lively hare that gave them more run
ning than was looked for. After a long
chase the game reached the lower escape,
but at once returned to the field and
started the hounds on another run. Again
the hare got away, but only to repeat his
performance and work the dogs to a
standstill. Relief dogs were let loose and
the course ended. The heavy going: will
have a bad effect on Fine Fire and he will
probably be withdrawn from the stake.
But nine points were scored in the entire
course.
The relief dogs were again called In the
go between Candelaria and Depend on Me.
A fast hare made the dogs extend them
selves and had them all out. Curtis' dog
won, the course, but will be handicapped
in the finals by the heavy work. Harlean
Gladys, a Futurity candidate, showed by
her work that she has recovered from her
recent severe going. She made The
Grafter do some running to beat her.
Sacramento Boy beat Theron in a good
go. Both oogs were well backed. The
best-played race of the day was that be

made a favorite of Thrift's dog, but after

and true, and a furlong from home was a

Atkins, already under the whip, closing
strong a length back. From there home
It was a hard drive. The crowd in the
grandstand were shouting and cheering,
the hysterical shrieks of the women ris
ing above all. "The favorite wins." was
the shout. "No, the favorite is beaten."
"Ballyhoo Bey wins," â¢ was then heard
from the followers of the Whitney stable.
Sloan was no longer crouched over the
neck of his horse, but was riding desper
ately with whip and spur. Henry was<also
working hard on Olympian, and for a few
strides It was hard to tell which would
stand the drive better., *Â¦:.---â¢
Gradually, however, Sloan, with all his
skill and cunning, drew away, with Bally
hoo Bey. and amid the wildest enthusi

finish line a. length and * a half before

of a length behind his stable mate, while
five lengths away Sweet Lavender headed

Ballyhoo Bey Wins.
The positions were unchanged through
the next furlong. Cap and Bells and
Ballyhoo Bey were running head and head
in front, the latter going much the easier
of the two and Sloan looking around for
danger from behind. All through the
third furlcng Spencer was urging Cap and
Bells. She was running gamely and still
held a slight advantage, but It was plain
to* all that she could not hold her speed
to the end. The pace was beginning:
to tell, and Henry, seeing this, -sent
Olympian along to take issue with Bally
hoo Bey. These three rounded thfc bend
into the stretch necks apart, but Cap and
Bells was done, and Â« from this point
gradually dropped behind, Spencer easing
her up when he found she was beaten.
Then came the big race and the parade
of the highly bred youngsters, led by the
Keene trio. Tommy Atkins, Cap and Bells
and Olympian, with Elkhorn and Bally
hoo Bey, of the Whitney string, next and
the others following. They got to the
post promptly and in a very few minutes
came the first break, which was a false
one. Golden Age refusing to Join his
company. The second was worse, for
â¢three refused. But the starter caught
them in line the third time, the red flag
swished through the air and they were
off to a good start.
Spencer, who was on Cap and Bells,
rushed his mount into the lead at once,
but Sloan, on Ballyhoo Bey, was not
caught napping and sent his horse along
side the flying filly. Elkhorn, Golden Age
and Tommy Atkins were close up, and
they came down the chute like a line of
cavalry. Spencer, who was plainly out
to make the running for his stable mates,
sent Cap and Bells along at her best
speed, but, do what she could, it was
Impossible to shake off Ballyhoo Bey,
who, a neck away, was principally help

crouched low over her neck, wide awake
to his advantage, for he was in a posi
tion to choose his own going on a track
that was dry and wet in places. At the
end of the first furlong Henry had
brought Olympian, another of the Keene
trio, from eighth place to third, and was
a length and a half behind Ballyhoo Bey,
while Tommy Atkins. Elkhorn and Sweet
Lavender were heads apart a half length
away, the others being already far out of
the race.

Olympian, was second, and Tommy At
kins, from the same stable, landed in
third place, with the others trailing. The
winner was ridden out. The attendance
at the big race was not as large as had
been expected, for it was thought that
the track would be deep in mud, and such
was the case at 10 o'clock this morning.
Nevertheless, fully 15,000 people were on
the grand stand, down on the lawn,
against the rails in the inner field ana
up In the "free" field. When the horses
were called to the post Just before 4:30
o'clock, the crowd had been coming in
steadily since noon, but there was no
great rush at any time.

called and between the races a big gang
of men were at work on the track, scrap-
Ing, raking and harrowing it, turning up
tho wet soil to }he drying heat of the sun,
and it was In good condition when tht
race was called, to the great surprise of
everybody.
The big crowd waited patiently through
the first race and applauded wildly when
the Whitney youngster. Rowdy, was set
back from second place for a foul. They
saw Mr. Whitney win the second with
Rush, and then plung-ed on Jean Beraud
to win the fall handicap, but Sloan, who
had the mount, after getting off llat-foot
ed rode into a pocket in the stretch and
was unplaced.
Leading experts who witnessed the bat
tle between Sharkey and Fitzsimmons
nay that Fitzsimmons is the gTea.test
heavy-weight fighter we have had In
many years, and many of them are of the
opinion that the lanky fellow will turn
the tables on Jeffries If they ever fight
ajrain.
DERBY, Conn.,- Aug 1 . 23. â James J. Jef
frits paid this afternoon that he would
not fight Fitzsimmons on August 31. He
declared it was too ehort a time in which
to get Into condition, and the public was
eick of fighters who need a rest for a
star. He thought a fight now between
Fitzsimmons and himself would be a
financial failure.
Although Fitzsimmons is confident that
he can beat JeffrieE, it is doubtful If the
big fellows will be seen In the ring for a
long time. While Fitzsimmons might
obtain his wife's consent to engage in one
more battle, the time Is too short in which
to arrange the details for a bout before
tlie Horton law expires. There is no bat
tie ground in sight except Carson City
where pugilists of note can meet Â¦without
interference by authorities. Fitzsimmons
is perfectly willing to fight in Carson
City, and Jeffries could hardly offer any
objections to Nevada If sincere in his de
pire to arrange a match. But there is an
other consideration that may cause the
f trescnt champion to hesitate about binfl
ag himself to a match at an early date;
It Is a theatrical engagement. He Is
booked for a tour of fifty-four weeks.
"None as yet. I am in favor of Bob's
immediate retirement from the prize ring.
He has got all tlie glory and money out
of figrhtlng 1 possible for him to obtain, and
I now want him to settle down and go
Into business." '.*{
Whether P-obert FitzsSmmons meets
Champion Jeffries or not depends largely
on the course Mrs. Fitzsimmons maps
out ftrr her husband so far as his pugilis
tic affairs are concerned. After defeating
Sharkey, Fitzsimmons said he would fol
low his -wife's advice regarding- his future
movements in the prize ring, declaring
that if he had given heed to her advice
before he would never have lost the
championship. When Mrs. Kltzslmmons
was asked what plans Ehe had arranged
for her husband in a pugilistic way,' Ehe
said:
"I have defeated Fitzsimmons decisive
ly once and I think I can do it again, but
I think it would be poor business policy
to fight right away, for the iiphtinpr pub
lic needs a rest. I shall let no engage
ments interfere with xny championship
battles, but I reserve the right to set
aside time to train."
Jeffries, who was at Derby, Conn., dur
ing the day, was seen there and said rela
tive to the challenge:
NEW YORK, Aug. 25.â Bob Fltzsim
xnons haÂ» challenged Jim Jeffries for a
fight to tÂ»e held August 31, and has posted
S25A0 as a forfeit. Fitzsimmons says that
Jeffries must meet him on* that day or
admit that he Is afraid of him.
Owing to Theatrical Contracts and
Otlier Considerations It Is Very
Unlikely That the Men
Will Meet.
Willing to Meet Jeffries Be
fore the First of Sep
tember.

For nine innings the Dudes did what
they could yesterday afternoon at Recrea
tion Park to send a man over the rubber,
but their efforts wi-re unavailing. Occa
sionally one of the unexcelled trailers
would reach the third station only to end
his efforts in sight of home. Even these
chances at scoring were few.
Jimmy AVhalen, disturber of the dia
mond peace and chief gyrator of the mill,
was in good form, and whenever the
Dudes showed on their faces hungry looks
for rubber ho let loose his curving right
and the Ewing men forthwith perished.
"Chief" Borchers, who. occupied the sla.b
for Oakland, held Stockton to six hits,
but a few of them were helped along by
unclean work of the Dude fielders. Ihere
never was a single moment when the
Dudes were in it. Stockton's backstop,
Kager, introduced to the league by Sac
ramento on an off Sunday, was back of
the slab for the Millers. He "behaved be
comingly.
In the first spasm the Millers shot a
couple of their own over the plate. Mc-
Carthy and McGuckoii held the lucky
tickets and they cashed in by some dis
qualifying work of Bowman at left and
some general fringy playing of Oakland's
infieldcrs. Â«
The sixth, gave Stockton three tallies,
Streib. Babbitt and Courtney doing the
rounding plato act in this inning. Man
gerina bv some poor work at the plate
made the runs possible. The uncertain
and "basement" throwing of the Oakland
infield to "Old Man Hutch" on lirst helped
Stockton's game along. In the ninth
Whalen added the sixth run to the Stock
ton list. The score:
STOCKTON.

LUKENS WINS OUT AGAINST THE
BIG WASTE-DODGE COMBINATION
Falls Down Stairs.
OAKLAND. Aug. 2.1.â Mr3. W. H. Jack
son, who resides at 217 Ninth street, was
stricken with paralysis to-day while on a
flight of stairs ana fell ten feet. She
struck on her head, sustaining a shock
which it is feared will result seriously.
In an effort to get out of the predica
ment, for that Is what the situation is
to the board, the School Directors ad
vanced the proposition that a special
union high school tax could be levied
upon the property-owners. This would
mean that in the event of the City Coun
cil refusing to allow the $25,000 in the
tax levy, the board might have escaped
from its dilemma by the special tax levy
route. But City Attorney Dow has said
that such a move Is purely illegal. Re
sponding to the school board's request
for an opinion, he declares that as the
Oakland High School is organized under
the charter it must be maintained under
the charter and cannot be supported in
any other way. This opinion applies par
ticularly to the Oakland High School,
but it affects the others as well, because
it absolutely prevents any special levy
for the schools, while the board Is again
faced with the necessity of asking the
City Council for the money needed to op
erate the second school which has been
created.
But the action of the board has be
come a serious matter, for Oakland's
finances are in such bad shape that
$25,000 unnecessarily saddled on the city
is a big item.
The School Directors have demanded
this $25,000 from the city. Heretofore
Oakland has not been compelled directly
to support the Central School because It
was listed as a grammar school and as
such v/as supported by the State appor
tionment of school funds. But the State
does not support high schools. As soon
as the change was made County Superin
tendent of Schools Crawford notified tho
city board that it could not longer draw
upon the State fund for the school.
Having created a new High School for
Oakland by changing the name of the
Central School without in the slightest
manner enlarging its scope of work, the
Board of Education is now groping about
In an attempt to rid itself of the direct
burden of $25,000 more expense which
many members of the City Council be
lieve was unnecessarily Imposed.

Charles W. Stilweli Is Sued for the
Recovery of Heirlooms Valued
at Fifteen Hundred
Dollars. -

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, Auc. 25-
A fight is on over valuable jewelry left
by the late Mrs. MarU E. Travers. Dia
monds valued at 51300 are being sought by
Dr. Harvey P. Travers, son of decedent,
and administrator of her estate. He
claims that the present holder ot th.
gema,. Charles W. Stilwell. secured them
from Ira M. Wentworth, who was hold
ing them in trust. The suit filed to-day
by Dr. Travers asks for the return of tho
jewels and $500 damages.
The complainant tells the story of how
his mother's heirloom? came into Stil
well's possession as fellows:
"Mrs. Helen M. Wentworth. wife of Tra
M. Wentworth, and my mother were
friends of many years' standing. Some
time before my mother died, she gave to
Mrs. Wentworth a i^air of soiitaire dia
mond earrings and a brooch with a cluster
of diamonds. She instructed Mrs. Went
worth to hold them in trust for me until
I married, when she was to give me :h*
Jewelry.
"About two months asra, Mrs. Went~
worth died and her husband to.>k charct)
of her property. Among her effects worj
the diamonds held in trust for me. I mail's
a demand for them, but was refused.
Later Wentworth told me flatly that iij
had sold the gems to Charles \V. Stilweli.
If he did so. he acted beyond his righr.
as the diamonds never belonged to nia
wife.
"Demands have also been made on Stil
weli, but he. too, says the valuables were
sold to him."
In his complaint filed by Attorneys ReÂ«vl
and Nusbaumer and Percy Black. Dr.
Travers declares that Stilweli wrongfully
came into possession and still retains and
claims to be the owner of the jewels.
Travers says he will have no difficulty in
proving that the late Mrs. Wentworth
held the diamonds simply as his trustee.

he met the Congressman he felt that his
fight was lost and that Lukens had won.
He also had in his possession a circular
which declared that United States Sen
ator Perkins, Congressman Metcalf and
State Senator Stratton were for Mr.
Lukens.
Judge Nusbaumer drove up to the Fifth
Ward polling place and there met the
Congressman.
"It looks like Lukens In the Seventh
Ward," said Judge Nusbaumer, "and there
Is no reason why it should not be with
Perkins, Metcalf and Stratton for him."
Then the manager drove away. There
could be very little mistake about the sup
port of these three for Lukens, for the
Lukens men placarded the entire Senato
rial district with cards to this effect and
announced it in circulars. The
battle ground was known to be the
Seventh Ward. It was acknowl
edged that Waste would carry
Berkeley, and carry It he did with a
vengeance, his majority being one less
than 500. It was also acknowledged that
Lukens would carry the Fiftieth Assembly
District, and no light was made in that
section by the Waste-Dodge combination,
for if the Fifty-first District was carried
the smaller district was of utterly no use.
Lukens was also acknowledged to have
the Fifth Ward, so that the fight centered
in the Seventh Ward. When Dodge failed
to carry the Seventh Ward, even though
Waste cai-rled Berkeley by overwhelming
figures, the fate of the combination was
evident.
Lukens Was Handicapped.
Lukens was given the short end of all
the arrangements and he had to win out
in opposition to the apportionment, and he
did so by securing influence that was
most potent. He was forced to make a
nght where he was the weakest, but the
stepping in of the Senatorial fight of two
years hence overcame that weakness.
Then he had a combination of two nv_Mi
against him. the apportionment of the dis
trict being such that the unique combina
tion that was made between Waste and
Dodge was possible. They could and did
arrange it so that a vote for one was a
vote for the other and a vote against
Lukens. and that it was impossible for
Lukens to win on a plurality voteâ a clear
majority was necessary.
The extreme popularity of "Waste In
Berkeley came near making this combi
nation effective. W. H. Waste is a young
man and a resident of the college town
and he received the support of almost the
entire university vote, both professors
and students. Out of 890 votes cast Waste
received 6S6, Lukens 200 and Dodge 13. or
a majority of 4SG votes for Waste alono
and 499 for the Waste-Dodge combination.
So Lukens went into the Seventh Ward
and his home ward, the Fifth, and he won
out. It was there that the Senatorial in
fluence was felt the most. But had the
ticket been a blanket ticket Lukens would
have carried the district without a ques
tion, for the Fifth District went as
overwhelmingly his way as Berkeley did
for Waste.
Last night "Billy" Hamilton left the
custom-house and made hi? appearance in
Oakland, and he came over on the Stale
Senatorial fight. "Smiling Billy" Hamil
ton once lived in Oakland, but that was
long ago\ before he got to making United
States Senators, and he is seldom feen in
his o!<3 haunts unless there Is a Legisla
ture to be elected. He cares nothing for
thr- AFsombly fights, for they have but one
session to serve, but when it came to
a hold-over Senator then Mr. Hamilton
made his appearance and the word went
down the line that Lukens was to be sup
ported.
Admits Lukens' Victory.
This was the essence of a meeting- be
tween Congressman Victor H. Metcalf
and Emil NuFbaumer in the Fifth Ward
during the balloting this afternoon. Emil
Nusbaumer was Congressman Metcalf'a
warm supporter, his active manager and
campaigner and is his personal represen
tative on the new Congressional Commit
tee. Emil Nusbaumer has been for Waste
or Dodge as against Lukens. and when
Within the last day or two It became
evident that this fight would hinge upon
the question of the next United States
Senator, and Perkins took a most active
hand in the fight for Lukens. There were
many elements opposed to Lukens, Â¦who
/became passive or friendly under the
warming influence of the United States
Senator.
The fight for State Senator possessed
one element which will have a gTeat ef
fect in the future. It means that United
States Senator Georpe C. Perkins is out
to capture the Legislature of two years
from now, and that he has be^uri by mak
ing sure of the vote of the one Senatoi
from this county who will hold over Into
the Legislature that will vote upon his
next candidacy.
are a little uncertain owing to the
many different kinds of tickets to bo
counted In some precincts, but they will
not change the result. Owing to tho
separation of the different conventions
there can be no question as to the result
and no trading is possible that will in
any way effect the final outcome.

The first! step* in what appears to be a
esoveaaat to unit* ail Southern Paciflo
Company employes not affiliated with
tone one of ttÂ« numerous railroad broth
erhoods or other organizations have been
tafcfrn by tnÂ« Order of Railway Telegraph
ers. This la one direct result of the battle
Sutde fteveral monthB ago by ihe 25,*W em
ployes of tha system against the attempt
oi the oocijMLDjr to force a mutual lnsur
lancÂ© scheme upon them.
[ At tnat time the Order of Telegraphers
frecornized that there was a large force of
Kaplbyes not organized and directly con-
Cected by nature of employment with the
ilOgraphera. These men are. the- traln-
Bnea, linemen, repair-men and all others
foonnected with the block system and kin-
Cx*d signaling departments,
f These employee are directly in touch
with tnÂ© train disDatchers' department,

>Lfnlla.te that the constitution of the tele
gfrax>hera' order has been amended to ad
|XJt them to membership,
i TberÂ« a no other organization of rall
potd man In which the block system m^n
Can bÂ« eligible to membership. They can
bot afillAte with engineers, conductors or
firemen. These have their Independent
brotherhoods. Brakemen and switchmen
kre also organized and admit no employes
tn any other department. The block sys
tem men were therefore deprived of a
Chance to affiliate unless the telegraphers
pJsould take them into their fold.
L That has now been accomplished, end
tfho block eystem men are taking advan~
lte*Â« ot the situation rapidly. At the last
pneeting of the telegraphers nine applica-
Itlons for membership under the new
clause were liled. while many more are
fbeir.g prepared. The men are making a
quiet canvass upon the proposition, with
the result that they predict that all of the

and he carried Claremont by a vote of
28 to 8.
The vote In Mitchell's Supervisorial dis
trict complete is as follows:
Fifth Supervisorial DUtrlct: Precincts 10, 11.
Third Wardâ Mitchell, 87; Pierce. 77.
Precincts 7, 8. 9, Second Wardâ Mitchell. J1J;

Peraltaâ Mitchell. 63: Pierce. 45.
lotalsâ Mitchell. 915; Pierce. 424. Mitchell's
majority, 691.
Late figures In the Fourth Supervisorial
District do not change the result, but give
H. D. Rowe a majority of K) in the entire
district. Tho fight in the First District
was confined to Washington Township,
and in this Horner secured 541 votes to 223
for Cash, carrying every district except
Decoto. Murray Township will be for
Horner and his nomination will be unani
mous.
Arrests for Illegal Voting.
The great battle grounds of the county
were the Seventh Ward and East Berke
ley. In these places the fight waged fast
and furious, and the element that usually
finds its employment in the Sixth, Fourth
and First Wards drifted over into the
aristocratic Fifth and Seventh Wards.
There were men in those wards who had
never been there before, and some of them
got into trouble over that fact.
In the Seventh Ward there were five
arrests for Illegal voting, but owing to the
fact that there is no election law under
which they could be prosecuted they were
charged with disturbing the peace.
The famous "Colonel" Cudany of West
Oakland got out of his territory and met
arrest in the Seventh Ward. He tried to
vote at the Thirteenth-avenue Precinct
and was arrested by Policemen Pardee,
Jacobus and Parsons. It took $100 ball,
furnished by some of his friends, to get
him out of his trouble. "Colonel" Cudahy
Is one of the characters of Oakland. He
blossoms at every election and at every
session of the Legislature, and after each
event he goes into retirement, only to re
appear when the next event comes around.
But the "colonel" met his Waterloo in
East Oakland.
Eddie Troy, who was secretary of the
Dalton Young Men's Republican Club,
also got into trouble in East Oakland.
Troy tried to vote first at the Clinton Pre
cinct In East Oakland and then at Thir
teenth avenue, and was arrested at the
latter place. He was with a man who
tried to vote the name of Police Captain
W. J. Peterson, who is away on his vaca
tion. The man escaped after trying to put
a handful of votes Into the box, but Troy
was arrested.
J. C. Jones and John Gray were arrested
In East Oakland and S. C. Pope at the
polling place at Fourteenth and Webster
streets.
Next to the Senatorial fight the great
contest was that between John Mitchell
and F. E. Pierce for Supervisor in the
Second Ward. The two voting precincts
on San Pablo avenue were scenes of great
activity.
The most remarkable ticket was that for
delegates to the State convention at Santa
Cruz. In some districts tickets were not
even put up, and a list of names approved
by the county committee will be sent. The
majority of Lukens in the Fifty-first Sen
atorial District is figured at 2S6. Lukens
secured 731 votes in the Seventh Ward, as
agalnsi 67 for Waste and 304 for Dodge,
which gave him a majority of 360 over the
combination. Lukens then carried his
home precinct by a vote of 250 against 36
for the combination. Lukens also carried
Temescal by a vote of 149 against 79 for
Waste and Dodge. On the other hand,
Waste received 686 votes in Berkeley
against 200 for Lukens and 13 for* Dodge,
The fight in the Fifth District was nar
rowed down to John Mitchell and
F. E. Pierce. They agreed to fight It out
in the Second Ward, and Mitchell won by
a good majority, though after a decided
fight. An effort was made to unseat Guy
C. Earl in his support of Mitchell, but
Mitchell carried the district by a vote of
two to one, and in one district of three
to one.
There was no opposition to Judges John
Ellsv/orth and F. B. Ogden, and they will
be unanimously nominated. Tho voting
of tickets for this fight was a mere for
mality.
Delegates to SJtate Convention.
Mitchell Defeats Pierce.
H. D. Rowe carried the Fourth District
as against Charles Roeth, getting nine
teen delegates as against eight for Roeth,
but on a minority vote Roeth had suffi
cient power to have the district cut up
into small precincts, the largest of which
had seven delegates and the smallest of
which one. Rowe carried the six delegates
apportioned to Thirteenth avenue and
Twenty-third avenue: the six apportioned
to Clinton and the Fifth Ward and the
seven apportioned to Berkeley, while
Roeth captured seven in the Third Ward
and one in the Fifth Ward, yet his total
in this district was about 200 more than
that of Rowe.
The Supervisorial contests were all of
great local interest, for it was a struggle
to control the Board of Supervisors.
The First District, in the lower part of
the county, did not have much of a con
test. C. S. Archibald,' who Is Postmaster
of Centerville, decided that a certainty
of selling postage stamps was better than
an uncertainty on the Board of Super
visors, and he withdrew. That left the
fight between C. F. Horner of Centerville
and George Cash of Irvington. Hornfr
won with little trouble and will be the
nominee. He will have to contest the
election with Thomas D. Wells of Dub
lin, who will be the Democratic nominee.
Homer for Supervisor.
The Lukens managers were wildly en
thusiastic to-night. There was an im
promptu banquet at a local restaurant
and a band of music was Becured to sere
nade the successful candidate.
So United States Senator Perkins starts
out with one vote from his home county
for two years from now.

At one time when IÂ»rd Kosebery was
visiting relatives In Dumferline he was
ono of a house party who gave a number
of amateur performances. TVhyte-Mel
ville, author of "The Gladiators," was
anothrr member of the party. -and also
something of an actor. Indeed, Lord
KosÂ«ebery used" never to lose an oppor
tunity to take part in private theatricals.
For many years Mr. Melville has enter
tained his friends with stories of the
plays they put on during his stay with
the premier.
llerc> is one of them:
In "Rob Roy" Melville took the part of
the famous brigand and Hosebery was a
chieftain of the triumphant clan. At the
last minute it was found that Rosebery
had no plaided socks to eo with his kilt,
and a stage hand painted the nether ex
tremities of the now famous statesman
in the required plaid colorings and all
which marked his clan. Toward tho mid
dle of the second act Rosebery warmed
up considerably to the part, and he could
feel the paint trickling down to the floor
from his limbs In great drops. But he
was not prepared for the remark which
greeted him from the front row at the
opening: of the next act, when an old
Scotchman said:

"The wind-up of as queer a piceÂ© of
work as ever I heard of came a couple of
weeks ago in my town, when a well
known crook was accidentally shot by an
officer, who was resisting a crowd of
street car strikers, and died In hospital,
after telling his story," said' a 'St.' Louis
detective who was In Washington on a
still hunt last week. "The job, began
eight years ago, and it got a perfectly in
nocent-woman Into two years of that sort
of trouble which consists in .wearing a
gray dress the shape of a gunnysack and
of going to sleep at night behind two
inch iron bars. I'll have to take you to
the beginning of -it to give you the con
nection.
"One summer afternoon, about eight
years ago, a truck drove up in front of a
swell - St. Louis house, not far from
Shaw's Gardens, and one of the three
men .in the truck walked up the front
steps and pulled the bell. The only per
son-who happened to be in the house was
the maid of the lad v of the house. It
was an afternoon - off for the other ser
vants and the mistress of the household
was down town on a 3hopplng expedition.
"'Here's that sofa,' said the man who
pulled . the door : bell.
-"'My mistress didn't tell me she was
expecting any sofa,' said the young wo
man to the man, in some surprise.
".'Well, it must ha' been orderedâ
here's the . name and address.' : said tho
man on the steps, producing a card. The
card was all right, and it showed that the
sofa, or," rather, the box couch, as Jt
proved., to be, had been ordered from- a
well-known St. Louis furniture establish

Some statistics are supplied by the Cali
fornia Petroleum Miners' Association con
cerning the scale of operations of the oil
miners In California. These are summar
ized In the statement that there are 271
wells in process of sinking, of which 142
are north of Tehachapl, mainly In the San
Joaquin Valley. Coallnga has 32, McKlt
trick district 29 and the Kern River dis
trict 35, making a total of 96 In the San
Joaquin Valley. Loa Angeles is sinking
3S wells, Whlttier 11, Brea Canyon 12.
Puente 7, and Fullerton 14. Ventura dis
trict is credited with sinking 43, Summer
land 4, Kreyenhagen district 3S and Mendo
cino, Colusa and other places 8. The daily
total production of all the districts is es
timated at 11,466 barrels and the total
tankage at i84,000 barrels, of which the
San Joaquin Valley. has 95,000.
Figures derived- from an authentic
source indicate that the total daily pro
duction of all wells in Pennsylvania aver
aged tf7,33o barrels. The net stocks of
Pennsylvania oil at the -close of 1S99
amountea to 13,1U3,S1Â» barrels, and on July
30 to 13,729,69$ barrels. Adding the net
stocks of the Buckeye and other pipe lines
handling Lima oil makes the net stocks at
the present time 26,800,275 barrels. The
Buckeye pipe line runs averaged 51,di3
"barrels a uay in July, or 213$ barrels below
the Juno average, which wa3 tne neavifSt
on record since September, 1SU7. The
total runs of Pennsylvania and Lima oils
amounted to 14y,411 carrels a day and the
shipments to 120.S80 barrels a. day In July.
For June the runs averaged 163, 1 20 barrels
and the shipments 133.1M barrels a day.
Professor *V. L*. U aas ut me Suite Awn
ing Bureau reports that as the rock ex
posures on the bank of the Kern River
show no evidence of any lault or line of
geological disturbance, to which the
course Of the river might be attributed,
and as the terraced Uaniis of the river
indicate a long period of gradual erosion,
there is reasonable probability that remun
erative oil yielding formations will be dis
covered on the south side of the river.
The San Francisco Savings Union is
litigating with the R. G. R. Petroleum
and Alining Company over the right of
riparian owenrship on the water front of
Ortega Hill, Santa Barbara County. The
San Francisco Savings Union haa ac
quired the Ortega rancho and owns Or
tega Hill, claiming that the southern
boundary line is the line of high-water
mark. The R. G. R. Petroleum and Min
ing Company located a so-called mining
claim in front of the Ortega Hill, below
high-water mark, and proceeded to erect
a platform for the purpose of sinking
wells in the ocean. The Savings Union
then commenced suit to restrain the con
struction of the platform and the sinking
of wells. The question which will be de
termined by the court is whether a ri
parian owner or the owner of uplands on
the ocean has a right to prevent obstruc
tions, s-uch as oil derricks, etc., being
placed In front of the property.
The Secretary of War has granted per
mits to the oil companies operating on
the Su'minerland tide lands to maintain
wharves for the purpose of mining: for
oil in the submarine oil fields.' Some
months ago the companies were notified
by the Government engineer for this dis
trict that tho maintenance of wharves
without the consent or the War Depart
ment conflicted with the Federal regula
tions covering mining privileges beiow the
high water mark, and the suggestion was
made that the wharves might interfere
with navigation. They were directed 10
apply to the Secretary of War for suc'n
consent. Since then the development of
this oil field beneath the ocean has been
At a standstill; but now the extension of
the wharves and the drilling of more
wells may continue without fear oi
further interference.
The Ims Angeles Capital says
The- island of Anacana. in the Santa Ana
channel, containing 1140 acres, has just been
surveyed and taken up under the mining laws
by a party frcm Ventura County. The other
channel islands are also believed to have val
vable deposits of oil. Santa Harbara Island
can sometimes be curiously seen by refraction
from Santa Monica, being really below the
horizon. It is not long since it was regarded
as absolutely worthless for ail purposes, but it
has lately been staked out by prospectors who
beileve that its oil indications are unusually
good. As to San Nicolas Island, little has
been known, except that it la a most desolate
E[>ot, and was used as a burial place by the
aborlsrlrnl dwellers in this region, but a seal
hunter who knows the island says that it has
a spring on which oil is always floating. There
is a strong oil spring under the surface, of the
eon, near one of the islands.
The Daily Mining Record, published at
Denver, says, referring: to the outside dis
cussion of the production of petroleum in
California:
New companies are being formed and the
production of oil is increasing. On the one
hand we are told by some unthinking idiots
that production Is increasing so rapidly as to
outstrip all possible consumption. Others again
never cease informlns us that oil companies
are organizing in such great numbers as must
eventually bankrupt the entire community.
All this we are now experiencing Just as Penn
sylvania experienced it some thirty-live years
aeo much to the sorrow and loss of Pennsyl
vania, for had the people of that State been
permitted to follow their own business Instincts
they would not have waited fifteen years for a
yearly production of 15.COfl.000 barrels an.l wn.cn
from that quantity tn 1&7S went on steadily in
creasing until it reached 33,<K'9,236 barrels in
1891 for the Pennsylvania fields alone.
â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢ In 1SC4, the year that the Pennsyl
vanlans cc-ased to be scared by reports of over
production and superabundance of companies,
the total production of oil in the bnited States
was 2 116,109 barrels. In . 189S the production
was 54,734,770 barrels. Out of this total quan
tity California produced the very insignificant
nrooortlon of 2 237.207 barrels. And yet we hear
tlfk Ibout over-production of oil In California
as though its two million odd barrels were
going to 6wamD the universe. Â¦â¢ '
But here are some more figures: The total
quantity of oil produced in the United States
up to and including the year 1S9S was SSo.201.
693 barrels. Out of that quantity how much
does the reader suppose California has pro
duced? 12.097.2C9 barrets. And yet wears tod
that we must be on our guard, that Callfoi-nia
Is producing oil in such unlimited quantlty
that the whole world will not be able to con
sume It. Â¦Â¦ Â¦ ' .

where she should have the couch placed,
the establishment being already -pretty
wellBtocked with articles of furniture ot
that sort, but she finally directed the three
men to carry It to the second floor and
place It In one of the bedrooms. The men
deposited | the couch according to the
maid's directions and went their way. ThÂ»
maid went to her own room on the third
floor to do some sewing for herself, and
a couple of hours later the mistress of the
establishment returned. The mistress ot
the establishment hadn't been in her room
two minutes before she discovered that
she was out just $6000 worth of diamonds
The jewels had been left by her In a Jewel
box in a bureau drawer, where she had
eeen them only a few moments before
leaving the house on her shopping expedi
tion, but when she opened the bureau
drawer upon her return the box was rme.
The rrfstress of the establishment made
careful search of the room and of the ad
joining rooms before she summoned tne
maid. Then she rang for the maid and
cross-examined her with reference to her
visitors during the aftemon. The maid
told the mistress that the three men with
the box couch had been the only visitors,
and showed her mistress the box t^J?i
The mistress at once said that she hafln t
ordered any box couch, and accused her
maid of being in cahoots with the three
men who had brought It. declaring that
the maid had arranged for them to bring
the couch in order to divert suspicion from
herself. The iflrl cried and protested and
went on her knees, but the mistress of tho
establishment was convinced that tm,
maid was the thief, or at least the accom
plice of the thieves, and she locked, the
doors and declared that when her husband
returned from his office she would have
the girl arrested. She did summon a
couple of men from the St. Louis central
office when her husband returned from
business and announced his beller, too,
that the girl was either crooked herself
or in league with crooks, and the de
tectives gathered the girl in. They inves
tigated her. and they found that she had
a first cousin who was a well-known
sneak thief. They failed to find that the
girl had ever had anything to do with the
crook but the mere fact that she haa
such a relative was enough, and when trie
girl was tried for the theft of the Jewels
It was the biggest po.nt against her. The
chief tried to put the girl through the
third degree, but she stuck to her asser
tion that she was Innocent In the face or
all sorts of promises of lighter punishment
if she would own up and' make some sort
of a statement that would give a line as
to where the jewels could De recovered.
ThC nerve with which she stuck to her as
sertion that she was innocent goc a lot of
her questioners going, but she was con
victed of grand larceny anyhow and sent
away for two years. .
"The girl didn't get any good time for
good behavior, for she became thoroushly
hardeneri over what she called the inius
tice of her conviction, and she cut up so
In prison that she had to do her entire two
years. She came out of prison a pretiy
soie. woman and a pretty hard one. ana
for a couple of years she went a pretty
craggy course â the central oiilce people
had their eyes on her all the time. She
didn't do anything to get herself behind
the bars again, but for all that 3he was
often pretty clo.-e to it. Well, some good
women of St. Louis came along and took
an Interest In the girl, who had a lot of
good traits that they saw, and they built
her up. They took care of her while she
was studying to be a trained nurse, and
a couple of years ago they got a fine po
sition for her as one of the trained nurses
In a leading St. Louis hospital.
"Weii, a couple ot weeks ago a sneak
thief well known to the St. Louis police
happened to get mixed up with a bunch of
streetcar strikers who were attacking a
car, and when one of the officers on the
car blazed away into the crowd this crook
got the bullet in his stomach. He waa
taken to the hospital In which this young
woman I am telling you about was a
trained nurse, and as soon as the surgeons"
looked him over they told him that he
was a goner. The man was perfectly con
scious and -pretty debonair at that for a
chap so near the big divide, and when the
consultation of the doctors around his
bunk was over and he saw a whlte-cappec!
nurse sitting at his side he gave a bit of
a start when he examined her features.
He looked at her intently for a while and
then he asked her to bend close to him.
for his voice wasn't particularly strong.
He then asked her if she hadn't done 'her
little two-year bit on the charge of lift
ing.' She frankly told him that she had,
and then he said to her:
"'Well, I'm glad I've run into you be- :
fore going into the discard. I got you
those two years, and I always meant to :
square you pome time, but they've
watched me so "close that I never had a j
show. It was me that made you do the j
tivr.c.'
"Then he told her ho-wr the job had been
cooked up and how he was inside the box
couch on the afternoon when it was de
posited in the bedroom on the second
floor of her mistress' establishmentâ how
airholes had been duly bored in the thin?
ro that he wouldn't smotherâ and how.
when the young woman had prone upstairs
to do her sewing- he had lifted the lid of
the box couch, done his little $0000 worth
of rummaging and tiptoed downstairs and
out of the. basement door. The nurse
called the superintendent of the hospital,
who knew her story, to listen to the
crook's statement and take it down when
the man repented it with his dying breath.
A copy of the dylnsr crook's confession
has been filed with the papers In connec
tion with the younR woman's trial and
conviction, and any time she wants a
home and the best going: with the mistress
who helped to swear her into State's
prison on circumstantial evidence all she
has to do is to say the word."âWashing

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Liverpool was firm and Paris
steady. , New York declined from 80c to 79%c.
Chicago opened weak, owing to .'Â¦ Saturday
liquidation, but the decline was thought to be
merely, temporary. The crowd were free sell
ers, .but the foreigners came again for cash
wheat, and there was a large export' business
in both wheat and corn. Receipts were large,
but decreasing. The weather in the Northwest
continued wet. and serious damage was rum
ored, owirlc to the continued rains.
-In the local market futures were off, but
spot prices remained unchanged.

NEW YORK, Aug. 25.â The New York Finan
cier eays this week: The loss shown this week
in the cash holdings of the Clearing-house
banks has been more than half made up by re
ceipts from the sub-treasury and by remit
tances from the Interior. ThÂ« total disburse
ments by the former amounted to $5,690,000 and
the receipts from interior banks exceeded ship
ments by nearly $2,000,000. Drafts drawn by
the Treasury Department and deposited in New
York in payment for gold received at the assay
offices on the Pacific Coast has contributed
slightly to swell the total gain. It was an
ticipated that the advance would nearly if -not
quite equal last week's loss, and this may be
the cause actually, but as money has been
coming in almost up to the closing moment
It is not all shown in the week's statements.
The export of gold Is practically at an end
for the present and probably will not be re
sumed to in appreciable extent before thÂ« sec
ond week fn September, when the third in
stallment of the British exchequer bonds will
have to be provided for. It Is possible, of
course, that England's need in this direction
may lead to an offer of inducements that may
cause the yellow metal to flow in our direc
tion, but In the meanwhile the supply will be
considerably augmented by receipts from the
Paciflo Coast, so that in any event nothing
but an unprecedented demand can cause us
even temporary embarrassment.
The fact that the New York banks received
from the Interior during thÂ« week almost
$2.000,OCO more than was withdrawn ' gives evi
dence of a very satisfactory condition in the
Southwest; in fact, reports from those sections
aaam to indicate a plentiful supply Of money,
and lead to the belief that no heavy demand
need be expected until very much later than
usual.

in market values that were made through the

inability of the market to digest easily was
apparent. When conditions like this arise gen

rious nations Involved for the immense sums
expended ip heard. American financiers are
weJl fortified against any possible unusual
drain of goltl. and banks are steadily strength
ening their p'Â»utirn by Increased circulation.
Foreign governmental Institutions are also pur
suing measures to enable them to meet the
enormous expenditures of their respective gov
ernments. The position of the Bank of England
was considerably strengthened by receipts of
gold from here and the Colonies. Retrench
ment, as for some tiir.e past, continues to be
the policy of the Bank of France.
According to trade reports a distinct Improve
ment ia noted In various lines, but the volume
of business la not ut> to the average, owing to
the unsettled state of leading Industries and
usual contraction In a national election period.
No essential change occurred in money mar
ket conditions. Payment by the Government
by rÂ»fur.(3ins operations and gains from the
interior have practically restored the cash loss
to the banks of last week. Stocks moved very
irregularly throughout, but worked lower to
ward the cloFe on sales by tired holders. Va
riojs factors combined to infuse activity In
special Issues, but although rumor* were plenti

little to the traders what semblance of truth

forded an opportunity for a profitable turn.
Foreign eurport. which last week .was an ef

Prices for Prunes were expected yesterday,
but at the close of business there was a rumor
that the association had again postponed the
announcement. Everybody Is now scaling down
previous estimates as t6 the size of the crop,
and it is even said that owing to the small
sizes and increased shrinkage the weight of the
crop will not be much In excess of last year.
In this respect Prunes are simply following
all the other fruits, none of which turned out
the large crop expected.-
The market is firm and several advances will
be observed. Fine large Peaches and Apricots
are very firm.

NEW YORK. Aug. 25.â Weakness was pretty
generally manifested throughout the entire
â¢tock market to-day, but as the offerings of
rtockÂ« were only fairly large In Brooklyn Tran
sit, not tr.uch of an Inroad was made on prices.
Early hesitancy Â«u succeeded by a rising mar
ket, but the entire list weakened in the late
tradings or. the publication of the bank state
ment and liquidation In Brooklyn Transit.
Numerous favorable weekly statements of earn
ings ra:..Â»- to hand, but their showings were
without aval! In sustaining prices. Respecting
the recent activity and strength In St. Louis
Southwestern, the July cUtement made known
to-day is explanatory- The report ehowed a
sain of 60 per cent In net earnings over the
corresponding t*;rlod a. year ago. Estimates as
to the extent to which the banks had recouped
themselves on eubtrearury operations and the
Interior currency movement for the loss In
cash last week was not borne out in the offl
ria! report. The discrepancy Is thought to be
Sue to the complicated Â» ret em of averages,
which does not indicate the bank's real
Mrength.
Result* Jn the etnek market this week were
0 '^appointing to bulls and bears alike. Whll
tbe market wan unrevponftivV to good news,

MENDE.NHALU salesyard 1732 Market st.Whether a person named as Inspector
possesses the requisite qualifications Is as
certained under the provisions of the Po
litical Code, section 1974. which says:
"Every elected or staff officer of the
National Guard must upon his appoint
ment or reappolntment to any office In
the National Guard appear before an ex
amining board for examination as to his
qualifications for the office to which he
appointed on the Governor's staff It may
be all very well in its way, but a brigade
inspector of the guard of this State is a
different personage, for the regulations
say:
"Upon officers of the inspectors' depart
ment commanding officers rely for Infor
mation as to the precise condition of each
of their commands, its affairs, discipline,
location and wants." Paragraph 74 re
quires that "The inspecting officer shall
have an intimate acquaintance with the
regulations and rult-s of the service, espe
cially those relating to his own functions;
and "an accurate and familiar knowledge
of tactics."
General orders No. 7 convey the 1 infor
mation that commissions have been issued
to officers, more than a hundred: In num
ber, some elected as far back aaApriL .
Lieutenant Commander T. A. Nerney.
executive officer of the naval* militia, has,
at his own request. 1 been relieved : from
duty as executive officer of the Marion.
First Lieutenant T. H. Derby, at an
election held in Company B. Fifth In
fantry, at San Jose, Captain D. A.; Smith
presiding, was promoted to the captaincy,
vice Partridge, term *xpiredr. The new
captain has a first-class National Guard
record and during the Spanish-American
war was promoted several- times in -the
Eighth California. for proficiency. Second
(Lieutenant G. L. Holtum was promoted
first lieutenant and Private Clalr Cutting
Markres was elected second lieutenant. .
The uniforms of the men of the First
and the Fifth Infantry will be. delivered
In a few days so that all can appear in
the celebration on parade In new clotheh.
Seventy-four citizens of Talbert, Orange
County, have sent a petition to division
headquarters asking to be formed into a
military company to complete the quota
of the "Seventh Regiment of Infantry.
Lieutenant Colonel Thomas F. O'Neil of
the First Infantry has addressed a letter
to Colonel A. "K. Whitton of the Fifth In
fantry informing him that at a meeting of
the board of officers of the First Regiment
a vote of thanks was passed to the officers
and tnnn Â«of the Fifth Regiment for the
splendid showing: madeby them on the
occasion of the funeral of the late Colonel
Duboce.
Major General Dickinson has issued or
ders for the Second Brigade to parade on
September 10. He will be In command of
the troops In the parade, which will con
sist of the First and the Fifth rog'ments
of Infantry, the signal corps and Troop A
Cavalry, with the addition of two compa
nies of lnfantrv from Stockton, one from
Woodland a^id possibly two companies
of Infantry and Troop JJ from Sacramento.
In pursuance of the orders from division
headquarters the brlgadiet of. the Second
Brigade has ordered his brigade to parade
on the day named and the troop and the
signal corps are ordered to parade
mounted.
has been appointed or reappointed, elect
ed or re-elected; provided that the provi
sions of this section do not apply to sur
geons Judges advocate, chaplains or the
staff of the commander in chief. Such
boards shall consist of three officers for
each brigade."
The orders read that Mr. Gaskill was
appointed and takes rank from A"prll 14,
1&00. at which time he was In Paris,
France. The examining board of the Third
Brigade did not take a flying trip there to
examine Major Gaskill. The major did not
report to the examining board at Fresno,
but he passed a satisfactory examination
before a board in a cafe In Paris, consist
ing of Colonels Foote, Runyon and Tru
man, detailed by orders from California
to conduct the examination. The question
that guardsmen ask is, Was that board of
three aids from the staff of the command
er in chief, they never having been exam
ined as to their qualifications to serve as
officers of the National Guard and prove
their competency to examine others, a
qualified board? The answer offered to the
question is that the three were not of
ficers of a brigade, as required by section
1974 of the code, and. further, that had
they been otherwise qualified they were
not in a position to lawfully discharge the
duties, for the reason that the regularly
appointed board of examiners had not at
that time been superseded, and the fur
ther fact that those were the ones author
ized by law to examine Major Gaskill. It
Is further stated that the three exam
iners In Paris were not in a position to
discharge the duties of officers as pro
vided In section 1917 of the code, which
states that an officer holds until his pre
decessor qualifies, and that no officer of
the National Guard can discharge the du
ties of his rank until he has taken and
filed an oath of office as prescribed by
law, and it la not of record that Colonels
Foote, Runyon and Truman filed their
) oaths of office as members of the exam
ining board of the Third Brigade. :y-.'rr<,
The guardsmen think this was a very
singular proceeding, and they are wonder
ing if it was the joint work of the com
mander In chief and his adjutant, for they
say that the former Is an attorney but not
a soldier, while the other may be a soldier
but that he is not a lawyer.
Another peculiar feature In connection
with these appointments is that by gen
eral orders E, W. Runyon takes rank from
April 14, 1900, vice Andrews, retired, while
the special orders declare that Andrews
was not retired until May 4, 1900. This
shows that Runyon was appointed to fill
a vacancy which In fact did not exist.
Was the Examination of
Major Guskill in Paris
a Legal One?
GUARDSMEN ARE
ASKING ABOUT
COMMISSIONS
National Guard officers are asking why
the adjutant general refuses to issue
rommlsfeions to officers elected In the sev
eral companies <tt tl:e guard without first
parsing the examination required by law,
yet issues a commission to the inspector
of the Third Brigade, who was appointed
while absent from tho State, and has not
yet returned, boing still in Paris, and who
bkfl not passed an examination.
It apr^ars that some time aÂ«*ro. for the
reason that the four citizens of this Staie
who were' sÂ«Â»nt on as the Commissioners
from California to the Paris Exposition
n:l?ht have propor courtesy and respect
shown them, the commander In chief
decided to make Messrs. Foote, Runyon
and Trumaji aids on his staff, with rank
of colonel, and Varney Gaskill inspector
of the Third Brigade, with the rank of
major. It Is probable that these ranks
were givon with the idea that the bril
liant uniform of National Guard officers
would obtain for th^m social recognition
which the conventional dress coat would
not have attained.
So far as this applies to the gentlemen
the house was confined to the kitchen,
and the damage done was slight.
Stories as to how the accident occurred
vary, but If the statements of the victim
and his brother Samuel are to be believed !
'"Moxie" died a sacrifice to Brandt's reli
gious scruples.
Samuel Rosenberg was with his brother
at the time the- accident occurred, and
tells the following story:
"My brother and myself were playing
outside Brandt's when he came- to the
door and* asked If one of us would light
the fire for him. 'Moxie' was fond of
lighting the fire, and Jie ran In with
Brandt. I went, too. Moxie took a can
Brandt gave him and poured the oil on
the fire. Then Brandt gave him a match.
He lit it and threw it in the stove. Flames
came out of the top of the stove and
Brandt called out to save the house. He
and Mrs. Brandt ran to the stove to put
the tops on. Moxio was in their way and
was pushed into the flame. Then I heard
him scream and I ducked out. I guess
Brandt and his wife got burned as .well as
Moxie."
"Moxie's" clothes, which were cut from
him, smell so strongly of coal oil that he
probably split some of the contents of the
can over himself, rendering his/ clothes
very inflammable. Although Brmdt said
there was no coal oil in the.' house, the
firemen found plenty. The house was
closed during the afternoon and all were
denied admittance. The Brandts are
known in the neighborhood as strictly
orthodox Jews, and are said to usually
call in some small boy to light the fire
for them on Saturday, it being unlawful
for a Hebrew to handle flre on that day.
Brandt tells a different story. He claims
that he went to the stove to get some
coffee out of the pot boiling there. Ac
cording to his story, when he removed the
pot a great sheet of flame shot out of the
hitherto pacific fire and enveloped Brandt.
His wife then grabbed him, ourning her
hands. He ran with his clothing ablaze
downstair s and collided with "Moxie,"
whose clothing caught fire In an Instant.
DESPITE the efforts of half a dozen
neighbors to extinguish the flames
which enveloped his form. "Moxie"
Rosenberg, a seven-year-old "boy,
was fatally burned yesterday morning
as a result of an explosion of coal oil^
caused by pouring the stuff on smoldering
wood in the house of Soloman Brandt or
Bratt, a peddler, at 256 Perry street, who.
according to the victim's story, called him
in to light the fire, as Jews may not kindle
a flame on Saturday. "Moxie" lived at
233*^ Perry street, but was a frequent vis
itor* at the Brandt house. The child died
of his burns shortly after noon yesterday,
after suffering fearful torture, Brandt is
in the Receiving Hospital, burned on both
arms and one leg.
At half-past 7 yesterday morning all
Perry street In the neighborhood of 25C
was startled by loud screams coming from
Brandt's house. A Mrs. Walsh, residing
at S45H. nearly opposite, ran to the win
dow of her house and saw "Moxie" Ro
senberg, his clothes ablaze, run out of the
house, closely followed by Brandt carry
ing a trunk or box on his shoulder. She
called her husband, who seized a quilt,
and running out wrapped It around the
burning child.
Sheridan "Wheaton, employed on the
transport Logan and living at 251A Perry
street, also arrived on the scene and as
sisted Walsh to carry theboy into the b&se
ment entrance of Walsh's house and cut
the clothes from his body, pouring olive
oil and flour on his roasted flesh to relievo
his torture. By this time the Fire Depart
ment was on the scene. Chief Sullivan,
seeing the little sufferer, delegated the di
rection of the work to a subordinate, and
placing the child In his buggy drove at
breakneck speed to the Receiving Hospi
tal. Dr. Bauer at once pronounced the
burns fatal, but everything possible was
done to eave the child's life. Some time
later Officer McXamara arrived with
Brandt, and during the afternoon the
peddler's wife Esther applied to have
burns on her hands dressed. The fire in
