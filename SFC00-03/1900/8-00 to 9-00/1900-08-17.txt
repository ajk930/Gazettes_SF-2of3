In an official statement as follows: :.". /r-\
Acting Secretary of State Adee made public the following extract from a dis
patch received this morning from Mr. Conger. It was handed to Mr. Adee by Mr.
Wu, who explained that he had received it at midnight from the Taotai. or
Shanghai, by whom it had been received by way of Tslnan August 15. It is un
dated, but would seem to have left Peking some time between August 5 and 11.
Secretary of State, Washington: Our cipher is safe. May it not

The appeal of China and the, prompt response of the American Government
were the subject of supreme interest throughout the day. Coming at a moment
when the allied armies were In the shadow of the great walls -of Peking the
circumstances In which" the correspondence occurred were of a peculiarly mo
mentous character. The President had just returned from a brief respite at
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16. â Chinese Minister Wu promptly telegraphed to Li Hung Chang to-night the contents of the ;
memorandum handed to him to-day by Acting Secretary Adee, giving the instructions which have been sent to Gen- ;
eral Chaffee regarding his course in dealing with the Chinese situation. The Minister, while regarding the situation as ~
critical, hopes that the instructions to the allied commanders may have reached them in time to provide for . negotiations with a !
representative of his Government, whereby the Ministers will be escorted from Peking in safety. â¢
WASHINGTON. Aug.. 16.â At the- close of a day of Intense anxiety, the
State Department to-night made public the latest correspondence be
tween the United States Government and China, constituting not only
a remarkable series of state papers but at the same time dispelling all
doubt and uncertainty as to the American policy In the present critical
Juncture. The urgent, almost; pathetic appeal of LI Hung Chang, submitted'
early in the day, that the victorious march of the -allies stop at Tungchau. and
that the military- commanders on the, field be instructed to arrange an armistice
at that point, was met with a response that General Chaffee already had been
given complete Instructions empowering him to carry out an : arrangement In
concert with other commanders for the delivery of the Ministers and the per
sons under their protection to the relief column, now at TunKehau, as had been
suggested, but at Peking. Furthermore, It was known to China that General
Chaffec's instructions left free rein as to whether he should insist upon entering
Peking and going to the legations or should receive the delivery of the lega
tioners at the gate of the inner Tartar city ; or. at the great outer wall. In
short, China, through her peace envoy, besought a halt and an armistice at
Tungchau, twelve miles from Peking, whereas the response Â¦ of the American
Government is that If there is to be a haltâ an armisticeâ it must be at the walls
of the imperial city. . . _
The conclusions of the Government were announced after an extended Cabi
net meeting and were embodied in the following official statement:
A cable from Earl LI Hung . Chnng," Envoy Plenipotentiary of China, dated August 13.
and received by Minister Wu at 7 p. in. on the same day:
"The allied force Is approaching. Tungchau. I have memorialized the Imperial Gov
ernment to depute envoy to negotiate an armistice with the several commanders on the
spot: I will a^so shortly proceed to Peking. The. powers, being fully aware of. the embar
rassing position in which their Majesties the Empress Dowager and ; the Emperor are
placed, are earnestly requested to telegraph Instructions to their respective commanders
after arriving rat Tungchau with their forces to stop their further advance to the capi
tal so as not to cause alarm and fear to their Majesties and calamities to the people.
For such advance would shake the foundations of the Ta Chlng empire and wound the feel
ings of all her people, hiKh and low. For a compliance with this appeal the -millions of
people 'of the empire will be profoundly grateful to the powers. Please communicate this
cableRram at once to the Secretary of State." ' .
The following memorandum in reply was handed to Mr. Wu this afternoon:

DANGER OF PARTITION OF GHIINA.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â Relieved by
the belief that the foreign Ministers and those under their protection are no longer in clan
ger, the administration here and the powers are giving attention to the policies that shall be
followed to satisfactorily terminate the Chinese question. President McKmley and his Cabinet
discussed to-day the future policy of the United States.
Further details respecting the occupation of Niuchwang by the Russians show that the
Russian admirals arrived at that port August 10 and formally notified the foreign Consuls that the'
Russian Government had taken over the administration of the town "for the protection of foreign
interests and Chinese."
No further information as to the intention of the British with respect to the landing of
troops at Shanghai has been received in Washington, and there is a disposition in some quarters to
believe that the British Government hesitates to take action which may precipitate serious compli
cations. But if Russia persists in retaining Niuchwang, it was stated to-night by a well-informed
diplomat that the other European governments and Japan would find it necessary to take posses
sion of Chinese territory.
The administration thoroughly understands the danger of the dismemberment of China,
and it will throw its whole influence against any proposition for partition. When discussion as to
the future of China occurs there is reason to believe that the United States will propose a treaty
between the powers which shall permanently establish the principle of the "open door."

CHINA MAKES ANOTHER FRUITLESS EFFORT
TO STAY THE ADVANCE OF THE ALLIES
T ONDON, Aug. 17, 3:45 A. M â A cablegram to Vienna from Hongkong announces the capture of Peking,
A-i but the Austr'an Government, like other European pewers, is itill without confirmation of this report.
An officia telegram dated Taku, August 14, has been received at Rome which asserts the attack on
Peking began on/ Monday; that Sir Claude Macdonald, the British Minister, had opened communication
with the relieving forces, and that th9 allies have established tneir headquarters at Tungchau.
The consensus of cpinion expressed by the morning japers tends to the belief that the legations
are now safe with the allies.
LONDON. Aug. 17, 3:45 a. m.â Chinese officials in Shanghai are reported as admitting that
the allies inflicted a heavy defeat on the Chinese imperial troops around Tungchau Sunday,
and then marched direct on Peking. This, if true, carries the Japanese official advices an
nouncing the capture of Tungchau one step further.
The western powers, according to a dispatch to the Daily Express from Kobe, have ac
cepted the proposals formulated by the Japanese for arranging an armistice, dependent upon the
immediate delivery of the foreign legations to the allies, or the granting of permission to the al
lied forces to enter Peking and to guard the legations. Upon these bases, the correspondent says,
Japan has already begun to negotiate. ,
Shanghai dispatches declare that the Chinese had intended to make a final attack upon the
legations last Sunday, but whether the plan was carried out is not known there.
â¢From the same place comes the statement that Vice Admiral Seymour and Brigadier
General Creagh have joined in the protest against the withdrawal of the British troops. All the
morning papers which comment on the subject appeal to Lord Salisbury not to withdraw them,
and dilate upon the serious results of such an action to British prestige. Â£
American negotiations looking to a cessation of hostilities also receive considerable atten
tion favorable and otherwise";* ~*but alF'the editorials agree that a too precipitate- withdrawal from
Peking after the delivery of the legations would have a bad effect upon the Chinese situation.
Describing the capture of Ho-Si-Wu, a special dispatch says that the headgear of the
Americans was quite insufficient for the awful heat, and that the consequence was direful.
Copies sere given out yesterday of Li Flung Chang's piteous pica for an armistice while
the envoys be delivered to the allies outside Peking lest an entry of the capital by foreigners should
overturn the Chinese Government, and of the reply, in which the United States showed that General
Chaffee had been authorized to grant such an armistice if in the opinion of the military commanders
it would be best to receive the Ministers at the gates from an imperial escort.
Meanwhile the American officials arc convinced that the envoys arc now safe, as the result
of negotiations or military operations by the allies.
Great Britain's decision not to land troops at Shanghai out of consideration for protests by
other powers has evoked an outcry of danger involved in such a policy from the representatives of
previously protesting nations, but without causing the withdrawal of their demands that they shall
also land troops at Shanghai despite the protest by other pozcers. The British transports had
sailed, but a torpedo boat was sent after them and have now returned to Wu Sung.
Official advices received in Washington confirm the announcement that Russia has taken
over the administration of Niuchwang', and other powers may now find it necessary to take posses

LONDON, Aug. 17.â Viscount Wolseley,
Field Marshal and Commander-in-Chief
of the British army, delivered, according
to the Daily Mail, the most scathing conÂ«
demnatlons ever heard at Aldershot after
witnessing yesterday's maneuvers. He
declared that the 30,000 men who partici
pated were utterly unfit to send abroad,
being badly led and badly taught."
Many distinguished officers listened* to
these remarks, among them General
Montgomery Moore, formerly In command
in Canada, but now commanding- at Al
dershot.

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 16.-General
Reennenkamp, according to advices to the
Russian War Office, while pursuing the
Chinese from Aigun, found 4000 infantry,
5000 cavalry and twelve guns in a strong
position at Sanjshan. Although the Rus
sians were inferior In numbers and had
only two guns they made combined front
and flank attacks on the Chinese on Au
gust 10. The Chinese succeeded, in break-
Ing up the flank movement and fought
with great stubbornness, but eventually
they were compelled by a .fierce Cossack
attack on their center to evacuate the po
sition and withdraw the guns. .
The Protestant mission here has re
ceived a cable from Canton saying that
the missions at Tiechi Chin Namon and
Luk Hang have been destroyed. The flr&t
was in the northern part of the province
of Quang Tong and the second in the
southern part.
The German officers think the allies will
not attempt to hold Peking, but will re
tire immediately with the members of thej
legations to Tientsin.

BY FIGHTING- COSSACKS
BERLIN, Aug. 16.â Count von Wald
ersee, accompanied, by the Countess
and by Vice Admiral von Walder
see, his brother, visited the United
States "embassy this morning and
asked John B. Jackson, secretary of the
embasry, to present his best compliments
to President McKinley. ,He spoke in tho
highest terms of the American troops,
saying: > "I know what they can do and
will consider it a great honor to have
such gallant soldiers my com
mand."
Before leaving Hanover yesterday he
made a speech to the Worklngmen's
Licd'ertafel, saying that he hoped to finish
his .task and return soon to Hanover. .In
response to the address of the municipal
deputation he said:
"With trust in God and in the firm,
cheerful courage of my troops, I hope to
carry out the plans and overcome all dif
ficulties."
The press points out that Count von
Waldersee is talking too much and ad
vises him to talk less. Several journals
have dubbed him "Felt Marshal."
In the course of a' conversation at â¢ the
office of the General Staff to-day he said:
"The general situation for the allies is
unfavorable, even if Peking Is taken or
is about to be taken, since the allies are
everywhere on the defensive except in
this advance on Peking. It is necessary
to adopt the strategical offensive through
out China."
His idea seems to.be to have the allies
act in conjunction with the Russian forces
in the provinces, of Kirin and Sheng King,
by way of Mukden.
Count von Waldersee will leave to-mor
row for Cassel, where farewell festivities
will be held on Saturday. They will con
sist of a military parade "and a banquet
to.be attended by a number of generTilg.
The banquet will also take the form of.
a celebration of* the seventieth' birthday
of Emperor Francis Joseph.

Tenth avenue, but not more than fifty
persona were there. They ran before tH
policemen. A mob was reported at

A riot call was sent in from Thirty

The mob was charged and many persons
clubbed.
Policeman John J. Howard saw a well
dressed man on the corner and ordered
him to move. The man refused to do so.
Howard knocked him down and took af
revolver from him. Howard made another
search and found that the man had a
badge. He then let him go, convinced
that he had beaten a brother officer. Half
an hour later the policeman who had been
clubbed staggered into the West Thlrty

NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â Such a fu
rioua ebullition of race hatred as
found vent in the rioting that oc
curred here last night over the
murder a few days ago of Police
man Thorpe by a negro named
Arthur- Harris has not been equaled in
many years. As a result of the disturb
ance, which raged from midnight until 3
o'clock and burst out in a flame of pas
sion and violence at Intervals until day
break, there were about fifty persons In
jured by pistol balls, razors or knives,
rocks and clubs. Of these one negro,
â¢Lloyd Lee, may not recover, and Police
man Kennedy Is also seriously Injured.
Lee Is alleged to have made threats
against the life of Kennedy because he
was the particular friend and associate
of Thorpe, the murdered officer. Thorpe
was the third white man murderously as
saulted in the vicinity by negroes, a race
prejudice having been engendered.
In less than an hour from the time the
trouble began last night the whole of
the AVest Side, from Twenty-eighth street
to Longacre Square, above Forty-second
street, including Eighth and Ninth ave
nues, was in an uproar.
Forty or more arrests were made.
Inspector Thompson, with 100 policemen,
In addition to. the several hundred regu
lar men in the precincts affected, was on
the ground in the riotous district before
nightfall, and he kept his men on the
move. They had orders to arrest any
man, black or white, who evinced the
slightest disposition toward riot.
The police arrested several negroes
after clubbing 1 them severely.
Negro Nearly Lynched.
Inspector Thompson was near Eighth
avenue and Fortieth street, when he no
ticed a tumult aboard an Eighth-avenue
car. Me ran with a couple of men to in
vestigate and found that a negro passen
ger was the cause" of the trouble. He
had not done any wrong, but several
white men tried to get in a punch at the
black man and two women tried to stab
him in the face with hatpins. Inspector
Thompson arrived just In time to see a
paving-stone crash through the car win
dow and lay the negro out with a stun
ning blow on the head. Louis Swartz IS
years old, threw the stone. He was ar
rested.
, Many fights between whites and blacks
resulted to-night. Alexander Robinson,
a negro, and a colored friend were on a
Thirty-fourth-street car. Some one set
; up a shout as the car neared Eighth ave
nue that the negroes ought to be lynched.
A man with a clothesline appeared from
somewhere and the two negroes were
pulled off the car. The rope was thrown
around Robinson's neck and with fifty
men and boys pulling we mob started for
a lamp post. A squad of police appeared
before the mob had gone far and with

Fhould be to stamp with viieir final disapproval
his fcttera&t to srasp imperial power. A self-

Liberty Congress of -the American League
Adopts a Platform Denouncing the
Policy of McKtnleg.
INDIANAPOLIS. Aug. 16.â The Liberty
ConprPF.s of tho American League of
Antl-Imperlallsts to-day emphatically
Indorsed tho candidature of William
J. Bryan for President. Th? convention
did not adopt the platform as submitted
Unanimously by the resolutions committee
without a long and heated debate, but
writ n the previous question was ordered
lesa than a score could be marshaled to
vote against the Bryan indorsement. The
vote was viva roce and Its exact result
wi'i never bo known, but the sentimort of
th? < "invention w?Â« clearly shown as be
ing In favor cf the indorsement of Bryan
Ba the most effective manner of checking
The alleged irrpcrialistic policy of the ad
ministration.
The most vigorous opponents of the
Bryan pronouncement in 4he platform
were consplcnons members cf the "Na
tional" or third ticket convention, v?ho
were also admitted .is tleiegater- to the
unti-imixTialifitie congress. They were.
led by Thomas Osborne <if Auburn.
rc. Y.. nnd advocated the nomination cf a
third ticket on the theory that their fol
lowers, while opposed to President Mo
ICir.ley. v.ere not prepared to accept Mr.
Iiryan 0:1 the Kansas City platform.
Every mention of Mr. Bryan'? name in
the convention called forth enthusiastic
applause. Speakers who opposed tho
Uryan plank in the platform were re
ceived with Jeers and cries of "tlmo" from
the delegate*, and th& chairman at times
had difficulty in obtaining a hearing for
Them.
After the adoption of the resolutions in
dorsing Bryan the representatives of the
third party met in the assembly room of
The Commercial Club and selected Thomas
Osborne ot Auburn. X. V., for permanent
chairman and Everett V. Abbott of New
York for permanent secretary. A motion
was made and carried that the conven
tion be held in New York on September
5 for the -purpose of nominating: a ticket.'
It is puid that tho third party men to-day
offered the Presidential nomination to
Moorfiold Storey of .Massachusetts*, but
that Mr. Storey declined the honor.
William 1. Palmer of Colorado was re
ported to be their choice for Vice Presi
dent. The leaders of the movement said
to-nipht that they expected a large rep
resentation at the convention in New
York on September 5 and that candidates
lor President and Vice President would
purely then be nominated.
Secretary Mize of the Liberty Congress
to-day receive J a letter from William
IJoyd* Garrison of Boston pledging the
writer's support to Bryan.
At the afternoon session the debate on
the report of the resolutions committee
was resumed. M. E. Bridgeman of Mas
sachusetts offered a substitute Ktrikhi*?
cut all reference to Bryan in the plat
form. Judge Moses Hallett of Colorado.
that the Colorado delegation would
leave the city curing the afternoon, and
en his motion all those delegates who
were forced to leave the congress before
the taking of the vote were permitted to
record thfir votes on pending questions
1 c-fore leaving or to instruct proxies to
vote for them.
Ex-Congressman John B. White of Ken
tucky took exception to the language of
the resolutions, which said that "we wel
seae all means of defeating Mr. McKIn
ley. 1 ' He said it* was language like that
which caused t lie assassination of Goebel
tn Ker.Tucky. He Baid he always had been
a Republican, and objected to the appar
ent desire of the convention to transform
Ksr-lf into a Democratic convention.
Mr White charged that a portrait of
Bryan was concealed under an American
f'.ag ovi r the jlatform.
"TakÂ° down that covering over Bryan's
picture." he said. "Let us not masquerade
any longer; let the convention be known
lor what it isâ a Democratic convention."
Then followed B running debate for and
against the amendment of Mr. Osborne
to strike out the indorsement of Mr. Bry
an. Those who opposed the amendment
find favored -the indorsement of Bryan
were William Potts of New York. Jacob
Jngenthron of Chicago. Fisk Warren of
Massachusetts. r>. u. Haskins of Massa
chusetts, James B. Howard of Harris
burg Pa.; A. M. Neff. of Ohio. Havid.
Rothschild of Massachusetts', N. E. Ouyot
t-f Colorado and Edwin Burritt Smith of
Chicago.
Trios* 5 who favored the amendment and
r<ppo<=<vi indorsf-mfiit of Bryan were Ralph
)l. Emerson <">f Massachusetts, a son of
Ralph WaMn Emerson: Robert A. Wilde
mann of Nett York, a dolfpat^ to the "In
-Vporidfm" or thinl ti<-kft ronvrntion, and
M E. Bridjrrman of Massachusetts.
Mr. Guyot of Colorado said he ha-1
F'-rvfri a year as a private F<">!dier in iho
Philippine?.- "To my own knowl^ge," he
Mid, "thessp operation? rarrif-d on by the
administration in the Philippines con<ti
tuf ihf most damnable crime in the his
tory of the United Slates. The Filipinos
assistf-d us to lard; they were in th-?
Tranches with us; they desired us to fir^
Upon the Spanish, and yet it is 5a:d th<^y
Mere not r.ur allies. They were our allies
and the entire record of the admfnistra
tion in the Philippine has been one of
trearhf-ry Â¦ and deceit. Could you have
neea u 1 have seen the conditions in the
Philippines you would not hesitate a mo
ment to indorse W. J. Bryan."
In closing the debate Edwin B. Smith
anf-wert-d the charge of Mr. White of
Kentucky by payiriR thÂ«"t he had no
knowledge of any portrait of Bryan in
Tom'.insun Ha!!. He s>ald the executive
committee had directed that all portraits
<>f all Hvinp men should be removed from
the ball before the meeting: of the con
prepp.
Before a vote was taken on the'amend
ment Mr. Ogborne accepted the substitute
of Mr. Bridjreman. which eliminated ill
reference to Mr. Bryan, and read as fol
lows:
"Without regard to views on minor
questions of domestic policy we welcome
and advise the use of all honorable
mean? of defeating- the re-election of
"William McKinlr-y in order to Ptamp with
our disapproval what he has done to es
tablish imperialism."
The robnitute was lost by an over
whelming majority, only fifteen voting
for it. The resolutions as reported were
then adopted, loss than a score of dele
pates rotlnx npainst them.
The following resolution, proposed ty
\V. S. Holden of Chicapo, w?.s added to
the platform ns reported:
"Rewired. That in declaring that the
principles of the Declaration of Indepen
dence apply to all men this congress
means to include the nc-jrro race In Amer

caie all erTnrts. whether in the South or
in the North, to deprive the nepro or his
riprhtK as a citizen under the E>eolaratlon
cf Independence and constitution of the
i nlted States. "
H. J. Scott cf Cairo fpoke strofaely ir.
favor of the rf-solution, claiming that if
it was ignored Bryan would lose thou
sand? of nf-pro votes.
By a rising vote th-> congress adopted
a resolution expressing appreciation of
The services of George S. Bout well in the
cause of anti-imperial's-m
The platform as adopted is as follows-

untold censure on him, but he defended
It to the last.
The success of the Populist movement
in Kansas was responsible for Ingalls' re
tirement to private life, the Populists
electing the whiskered Senator Peffer.
After his defeat Ingalls publicly admit
ted the Populists had many causes for
complaint, and made a play for Populist
support. Later, however, he returned to
the Republican party, and re-entered the
race for the Senate. His speech at the
State convention created great enthusi
asm. He began: "The snows of many
winters have whitened my hair, but the
fires of my early youth still burn in my
soul."
Ingalls was a polished orator and a
master of the English language. The last
few years of his life were devoted to lit
erature. His writings are classics. In
the rooms of the State Historical Society
in the State House there is an Ingalls al
cove filled with literary contributions
from the famous ICansan.
SKETCH OF THE CAREER
OF THE LATE SE2TATOB
John James Ingalls came of good old
New England stock, his original American
ancestor, Edmund Ingalls, having been
the first settler of Lynn, Mass., and the
male members of his family having pre
formed distinguished services in the
French and Indian wars, the Revolution
and the war of 1812. His father was a.
native of Mlddleton, Essex County, Mass.,
where John J. was born December 29,
1S33.
His early education was by private In
struction and in the school3 of Haverhill.
Mass. He later entered Williams Col
lege, from which he was graduated in 1855.
Upon leaving college he began the study
of law and was admitted to the bar in
1S57. The following year he removed to
Atchison, Kans., where he attained great
professional success, and by reason of his
strong personality and his vigorous meth
ods, soon became prominent In politics.
He was sent as a delegate In 1S53 to the
Wyandotte convention, which framed the
first State constitution for Kansas. In
l&CO he was Secretary of the Territorial
Council, in 1SC1 Secretary of the State
Senate and in 1862 State Senator. In that
year he was a candidate for Lieutenant
Governor on the Republican ticket, but it
was defeated. He then took up Journal
ism and for three years was the editor of
the Atchison Champion and at the same
time served on the staff of the militia.
After another unsuccessful trial for the
place of Lieutenant Governor in 1884 he
settled down for the next nine years to
law and journalism.
In 1873 he was elected to the United
Etates Senate as a Republican, taking his
seat March 4, and was re-elected to the
same in 1879 and 18S5, serving eighteen con
eecutive years.
Few Senators had a stronger hold on
popular favor and the Senate chamber
was always filled to overflowing 'when it
was known that he Â¦was to speak. From
his first entrance into politics Mr. Ingalls
was a prominent figure and exerted a
positive Influence in the trend of events of
his time. A pioneer on advanced lines of
thought, gifted with a vividlty of por
trayal and powerful eloquence, a master
of satire and Invective, widely read and
keenly observant, and so able to illumine
every theme with knowledge and experi
ence, he was ever the fchampion of any
cause that ho espoused. His great speech
on the "cloture resolution" of 1890 will
long be remembered for the self-reliant
courage with which, against partv pres
sure, he maintained a fearless and per
sistent opposition to a measure which he
believed Invaded the privileges of the
Senate and violated the fundamental prin
ciples of constitutional government.
From 1883 to 1S91 ho was President pro
tern, of the Senate and in that high sta
tion displayed the utmost courtesy. Im
partiality and' dignity and proved himself
to be a thorough master of parliamentary
law and procedure.
After his retirpment from the Senate in
1S91 Mr. Ingalls devoted himself to farm
ing, journalism and literature, articles
from his pen being frequently seen in the
dally press, as well as In the high-class
magazines. He was married In 18C5 to
Miss Anna L. Cheeseborough of New
Tork City, by whom he had eleven chil
dren, four sons and seven daughters.

EAST J-AS VEGAS, W. il., AUg. IB.â
United States Senator John J. In
galls died at 2:15 o'clock this morn
ing at the Montezuma Hotel, Las
Vegas Hot Springs. His remains
were started for Atchison, Kans., his late
home, this afternoon, accompanied by
Mrs. Ingalls and their youngest son, Shef
field. The body will arrive in Atchison
Friday afternoon and the funeral will be
held from the old homestead on Sunday
afternoon. In accordance with a special
request of Senator Ingalls every feature
cf the funeral will be simple. The body
will be taken from the Ingalls residence
to Trinity Church Sunday afternoon,
where episcopal services will be read by
Bishop Millspaugh. The Interment at
Mount Vernon will be private. No funeral
sermon will be preached and there will
be nothing in the nature of a public dem
onstration.
The .direct cause of death was bron
chitis. Senator Ingalls had been growing
weaker for some time from Inability to
assimilate his food and there were also
heart complications. He had been able
to sit up last evening, however, and his
condition then was /considered slightly
better. He had made all plans to leave
for Atchison, where he had expressed a
wish to die. and it was intended to start
not later than Saturday- next. Of the
Senator's last hours Sheffield Ingalls said
to-day:
"Father was taken suddenly worse a lit
tle after 9 o'clock last evening. The med
ical director of the hotel informed us that
my father was not likely to live unltl
morning. I left his side at midnight and
retired to my room for a short rest. My
mother, whom he desired not to leave his
side, came to my door about 2 o'clock this
morning ar.d told me that the end was
near. Soon after he !ost consciousness
and passed peacefully away. He talked
to us up to a. half hour before he died
and repeated the Lord's prayer with my
mother some time before he lost con
sciousness. His conduct all through his
illness has been one of great fortitude.
He was anxious for the end to come, a?
he had felt for the last six months that
his life work and career of usefulness
was over."
Senator Ingalls' Illness dates from
March, 1SS9. when at Washington his
throat began troubling him. He occu
pied apartments at the hotel with his
family and worked steadily writing polit
ical articles for newspapers throughout
the country. He was treated by several
specialists, but received no relief, and
on their advioe returned with his family
to Atchison. At home lie grew no better
though under the constant attention of a
specialist. Ten months ago he again took
the advice of physicians and sought an
other change in climate, traveling
through New Mexico and Arizona. He
was still able to write occasionally for
the newspapers and to attend to his busi
ness affairs. From time to time reports
of his serious illness were circulated, but
they were invariably denied, both by the
Senator ar.d his family. He did not con
sider his case hopeless by any means.

THE LATE JOHN J. INGALLS.
Slinkey. after his conviction, was taken

I'-as to be brought to the jail here, but
j -ked to be allowed to go to bed until
KOber. He was placed in the Ryan House,
and v:hen next seen was in his death
Btrusgles. Slinkey was well known
throughout this county.
The cause of his last and successful ef
fort this afternoon was a trial before
Jiidge Belrude of Sausalito last night on
ii charge of disturbing the peace. This
inornxng when he appeared for sentence
he was fined $10, and when he used vio
lesg language to the court he was fined
I.' for contempt.
The nieht before last a. man named
Ross was having a little dispute
with his wife, and Slinkey, who
was a deputy Marshal. went to
the house to quell the disturbance. The
woman threw him down the steps and he
retired and procured a warrant for her
arrest. Not to be outdone, she got a
Â¦warrajit for Slinkey's arrest for disturbing
the peace. At the trial both were con
Â¦\-icted. the woman, Annie Ross, being
lined $5.
Some years ago a murder was commit
ted here, and the authorities were look
ing for the murderer. Slinkey went to
the Sheriff's office and surrendered him
self as The murderer. It afterward turned
out that he knew nothing about the crime
.:nd was only recovering from the effects
of a debauch.
In late years Slinkey has met with many
reverses of fortunes, and has often at
tempted to commit suicide. About two
months ago he jumped from the steamer
Sausalito when she was about half way
across the bay going to Sausalito. He
was rescued with much difficulty. At that
time ne said he would kill himself, but
that he would not try to drown himself,
as his two attempts had failed. His pre
vious attempt at suicide was made from
the ftfterdeck of a steamer lying at her
dock in Sausalito. At that time he was
rescued by his faithful dog, which pulled
h'm out of the water.
SAX RAFAEL. Aug. 16.â Dan Slinkey,
A' e poundmaster of Sausalito, committed
". icide this afternoon at about 4 o'clock
at the R^-an house in that town. The
Coroner was notified and went to Sausa

turned a verdict of death from an over
dose of morphine taken with suicidal in

COVELO, Aug. 16.â J. E. King, wanted
for the murder of S. H. Church In Marln
County last month, is still a fugitive from
justice. For weeks Sheriff's posses have
followed his trail over a mountainous
country and through almost inaccessible
passes, but he has shrewdly eluded his
pursuers. Worn out men have ridden tired
horses into surrounding towns and others
have taken their places in the man-hunt,
but apparently to no purpose.
Posters have been printed and freely
distributed throughout the State giving a
full description of King. A reward of $300
for his capture is offered by the Governor
and his family adds $200 more to this sum.
He is described as follows:
Ago 41), weight about 140 pounds, height
5 feet 8 inches, complexion fair, high
cheek bones, drawn, thin face; light col
ored eyes: sandy mustache, may be shaven
now; had a scar on one cheek, having the
appearance of being caused by a burn In

Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
t LOS ANGELES, Aug. 16.â The end of
tho disgraceful Slovinskl case has been
reached and it Is probable that the ilat
of the unsavory business has been heard
of In Los Angeles. Mrs. Slovinski, with
her child, has left the State, criminal
prosecution has been dismissed, the civil
suit will be and the only thing remaining
will be- the proceedings in the probate case
growing out of the $1500 cash ball de
posited In Justice Austin's court, and as
the special administrator is one of the
Slovinski lawyers it is hardly possible
anything will ever become public as to
the final disposition of that fund.
The two notes for $15,000 alleged to have
been signed by Maines at the point ~of a
pistol have been destroyed; in fact were
destroyed before the criminal prosecution
was dismissed and that really settled the
whole matter.
At the meeting between Varlel, Mes
erve, Maines and Moss Monday the notes
were burned in the presence of all parties.
Later the criminal prosecution was dis
missed, It being understood that the civil
suit would also be dismissed. It was
agreed among all the parties that what
took place at this meeting should be con
fidential and should never t>e disclosed un
der any circumstances. But, as in all
cases of this kind, everything has como
out, although It has been somewhat, de
layed. It may safely be assumed that
Mrs. Slovlnskl will never again be seen
In Los Angeles.

Ingalls' election to the United States

election was conceded. Ingalls. who was
known as a promising young lawyer and
orator, had hardly been mentioned for the
Senate. On the morning the Legislature
was taking its final vote, Senator York
arose from his seat and charged Pome

money on the Speaker's stand. It was a

"That is all we want," said Mr. Wllkle
yesterday. "Any one can readily see that
it would be useless for us, as eight-hour
mills, to, try to compete with outside fac
tories that are running nine, ten and
twelve hours a day. Give us the protec
tion asked and we will' accede to the re
quest for eight hours. Should the eight
hours be granted without this protection
1 predict that at least twenty-five of the
plants now running would bo forced to
the wall. My mill, lor one, would ha,ve to
be put on the market."
Sir. Wilklo's statement Is eijrnlflcant In
that it Indicates that' the mill-owners are
now for the lirst- time ready I to meet the
men in a proposition. According to Mr.
Crocker,' 'the agreement which the own
ers would now like to havei the men ac
cept was originally proposed: by the coun
clf, but a month before tho time came
for a' final settlement they backed down.
President McCarthy of the Building
Trades Council in reply to this statement
paid last evening: 'The Building Trades
Council feels tsatlslled that all branches
of the building Industry can be run on au
eight-hour basis. The contractors are
also satisfied that eight hours are long
enough for any man to work on a build
ing. That being the case, the mill-own
ers will llnd no difficulty In bringing to
their aid the hearty co-operation of all
the men Interested in the bUIldlng busi
ness. Under those conditions work com
ing from a nine-hour establishment can
be located so easily and prevented so
readily that it willnot take long to stop
the-entire output of nine-hour mills.
"The mill-owners will then have a fair
field to rtgurein. There will be no un
due advantage taken and all will havethe
same show. The contractors In this par
ticular case are Just as anxious to bring
these conditions about as ; are the mill
owners and when the mill-owners co-ope
rate with the other institutions .which are
now. and have been for some time, en
deavoring to bring about' the uniform
eight-hour day, they will have consider
able more -work, to do than'' heretofore.
But previous to â¢ these conditions being
brought about Â¦ the ' contractor Â¦ must cer
tainly be protected. His Interests must
be carefully guarded and when they are,

The trial of Charles G. Adams for the
murder of Edgar S. Kepner on February
10 last was continued before Judge Lawlor
yesterday. The motive for the crime has
been made clear. All of the witnesses
agree that Adams shot Kepner for re
venge. Kepner discharged Adams for ln
competency, and for this Kepner paid
with his life.
That Mrs. Kepner, widow of the. de
ceased., was In no way connected with the
case, as was first published, has also been
made clear. An affidavit made by,Cha"rles
Dryden, tho newspaper man, refutes tho
assertion that John M. Patterson, the por
ter employed by the dead barber, said
shortly after the commission of the crime
that the tragedy was the result of Adams'
acquaintance with Mrs. Kepner. Patter
son altio denlpB that he made any such
statement, and under oath has given the
motive for, the crime aa accepted by the
prosecutionâ revenge.
"I cue.'tlpned the colored porter," said
Mr. Drydeh in his deposition, "about half
an hour after the shooting. He told me
that at closing time â 1 o'clock p. m. â
Kepner had discharged his assistant bar
ber. Charles G. Adams. His discharge
led to a. wrangle between Kepner and
Adams during which Adams called Kep
ner vile names. Kepner then ordered
Adams out of the shop, and the abuse
still continuing Kepner started -toward
Adams to eject him. They had a struggle
in which Kepner was shot.'
"In talking with Patterson about the
shooting, and the 'cause of it, he did not,
in my recollection, speak of any relation
ship existing between the wife of Kep
ner and Charles G. Adams."
John M. Patterson, the porter, and II.
E. Knowles testified in tho trial .yester
day. Both gave detailed accounts of the
tragedy. -They told how J<epner had dis
charged Adams for incompetency and how
Adams, after preparing to leave 1 the es
tablishment, returned, and after, cursing
his employer shot â¢ him.
The case will go on again to-day.

President Kern said: "Work from nine
hour mills Is traced to Its destination,
both in Oakland and San Francisco, and
the men warned not : to handle It.'.-" The
mills acceding to .the! eight-hour request
and therefore considered fair are: The
Humboldt, the Zenith, C. M. Jenkins, Mc-
Manus & Gartner and Vcitch's mills.
Those the council considers unfair are:
Burnham, Standeford & Co. : Kendall's,
Neihaus', Towle & Broadwell. Bridfjeman
& McCulIy and Ingler and Atkinson. The
locked-out men are preserving excellent
order and are keeping away from the

OAKkAXO. Aug. 1G.â The action of the
Building Trades Council In backing the
mill operatives' j fight for an eight-hour
day has affected several hundred of the
allied. craftsmen in this city. In accord
ance with instructions . sixty men em
ployed on. the De Fremery , building lnld
down their tools to-day, .and work will
not be resumed there by any union me
chanics until the struggle is settled or the
contractors, "vVllkio & Faulkner, have met
the operatives' demand. The situation
there is peculiar. Contractor "Wllkie Is
the proprietor of a mill In San Francisco
which has been classed as "unfair" by the
council, as the proprietor hat? refused to
run on an eight-hour schedule.
All contractors in this city have been
notified that the Building Trades Coun
cil will not permit union Â¦ men to work
where "unfair" material is used.
It Is estimated that there are 150 build
ings in course of construction here, em
ploying about 1500 men. Within a few
days, say the contractors, all the mill
material turned out before the lockout
will have been used and contractors will
then be given the alternative of using
"fair" material or stopping work. .
To-day the plumbers employed by Con
tractor \V. Batson on Third street, near
Alice, were ordered out on the ground
that Batson Is "unfair." Contractor C.
E. Nichols has consented to use material
from "fair" mills and his name was re
moved from the taboo list.

A' regular meeting of the council was
held at the Labor Bureau headquarters
last evening.' at which the situation was
discussed. The members were confident
that they v had the battle nearly won.
More work turned- out by nine-hour mills
was refused by local contractors yeBtcr
day and'somp'of it was hold pending an
Â»-arly settlement of the trouble. It Is be
lieved that next -Monday will see all the

the reasons why we carinot consistently
bar outside competition and compel local
contractors to deal in home products ex
clusively until all our mills here have
formally declared themselves In favor ot
the oigrnt-hour rule."
An informal conference of the mill
owners was held last evening, when the
situation whs gone over. A general meet
ing of those who signed the agreement to
continue as nine-hour shops will be held
cither this evening or to-morrow anight,
andit is stated on pood authority that im
portant action . along the linos quoted
above will bo taken.
The third period was remarkably excit
ing. Parsons knocking a goal after splen
did work by Big Joe and?Ollie Tobin,
making the score 3 to 2. Despite desper
ate swipes and swings made by the Reds
Ilobart and Dunphy were Invincible, and, I
well backed at times by Praed and Caro
lan, eventually won out, the score stand-
Ing 4 to 3. Mr. Carolan once saved a goal
for his team and by rnpid moves earned
worlds of praise for his efforts.
At the golf links E. R. Folger beat
Lansing Kellogg with 6 and 5 to play; E.
J. McCutcheon beat S. L. Abbott, 3 and 1
to play; J. W. Byrne beat J. Bourne. To
morrow E. It. Folger will play J. W.

At about 4. o'clock Umpire John Crlm

The Reds lined up as follows: Joe To

Joe Tobin.
The ensemble of the Blues was: Wal
ter Ilobart, Charley Dunphy, C. Eraed
and Frank Carolan.
Previous to the game Walter Ilobart
predicted victory for his team. Ilobart's
work bordered on tho marvelous, and in
his efforts he was ably assisted by gritty
Charley Dunphy. for the latter's "taking
care" of big Joe Tobin by interference
won the game for the Blues.
, Walter Hobart scored first for his side,
his suburban work after getting clear of
the scrimmages being away above par.
At the end of this period the game stood

of the second period tho Blues led 3 to 1.
Astride his pony, in endeavoring to

look, for everybody Journeyed to the

thing caused such a general shaking up
as the polo -game â¢ between Walter Ho
bart's "Blues" and Joe Tobin's "Reds."
It was not for. marbles or chalk, but for
coin on the side and glory. No such
sport has been seen here before and each
side played a remarkable game, ; the great
crowd present repeatedly applauding a
particularly reckless maneuver. Con
trary to -general expectations Ilobart's
Blues won out by a score of 4 to 3. Every
individual player performed heroic deeds
in. the way of taking a chance of making
himself a subject for the autopsy sur
geon.- During the second period Acting
Ills Excellency Joe Tobin Injected a
semicolon into the game which was some

Mr. Tweed would ciye no estimate of
the value of Mr. Hunar.glon's estate.
"It Is too early to predict what will
eventually be done by the directors and
etockholcJers of tlie company. It is likely
that Mr. Huntingdon's nephew. H. K.
Huntlr.pTnn. as lirst vice president of the
road, v.ill become the active head of the
company. As lirst vice president, witn
his office in Pan Francisco, he has for

The arrival to-day of II. K. Huntington,
the nephew cf the railroad builder, who
bad traveled with record-breaking speed
from tho South, was followed by the com
pletion of the necessary arrangements.
The trip was considered a remarkable
journey by railroad men, taldng into con

Hassrtt then left the court and with
tho knowledge that the record in the mat
ter of the estate of the late Collis'P.
Huntington had not been materially
changed to his advantage.
It Is ordered that the application of P. Bo
land for Rj>eclal lett-rs b<? and It is dismissed
thr-re bfinc no proof proffered In support of
the application.
"I have nothing to add to the record
that whs made." said Judge Cofrey, as ho
drew his pen through Hassett's order
and wrote another, which reads:
It app^arine to the court that the cause In
the above entitled estate has not been assigned
for hearing: to I>rr>artment 9 or this court by
Hi* 1'reKMinfr Juigo of the. Superior Court, and
that tho ari'llcation for Fpeclal letters of ad
mlrilMration upon the estate of Collls P. Hunt

IJ<- : Â»artmf-nt 9 of tlie court. It Is ordered that
the abdication for Fpeclal letters be and It is
dismiFsed. i
"I am only responsible for judicial ut
terances and I suppose they are ex
pressed in thr> record," said Judge Coffey.
"The record, as I understand It, win
simply that the Public Administrator's
application was dismissed from your de
partment because it was not properly
ap.^sned and I ask that this order be
made to carry that out:
"Yep. sir; pimply to ask your Honor If
you were correctly quotedâ that was all,"
retorted H&SSettJ . ,
"I wish to bring to your Honor's atten
tion for a moment tho matter Qf the es
tate of Huntington which was up here
yesterday," said Mr. Hassett. "I see by
the newspapers that you are quoted to
have said thinps that have Riven Mr. Bo
land considerable offense Â¦ and which are
<Â« rtainly not very complimentary to me
as a member of tho bar after being here
so many years." - Â¦

leee?" answered Judg Coffey with a
Fmile.
Attorney M. C. Hassett., on behalf of
the Public Administrator, made another j
futile attempt to retain a standing 1 in I
court "in re" the estate of the late Collls
P. Huntington. Mr. Hassett used the
nev/Fpaper articles as a basis for this sec
ond effort, claiming that in one of the
morning papers at least his motive In ap
plying for letters of administration upon
the estate, had been impugned. When
court convened Mr. Hassett was present
to seek official redress.
The committee in charge of the ar

At Corbett's there will be to-day opera
tors to send and receive the messages.
The poolsellers think they have the best
of it, and for the matter of that so do
their lawyers, who have given much time,
attention and counsel on the new scheme.
Corbett's contention is that all he now
conducts Is practically a branch telegraph
office.
As soon as a deposit shall have been
made tho local seller will wire to the Ban
Jose office, and if the bet is then placed
the return will be received at once by wire
and the deposit certificate will be Issued.
When a man wishes to place- money on a
fighter he will deposit the amount with
the local agent and receive- from him a
certificate of deposit, which recites the
amount, odds and on whom it may be
wagered. As a saving clause the final con
dition on the printed deposit is in sub
stance a reservation by the agent that If
the bet cannot be placed the sum will be
refunded.
Under this new and carefully thought
out scheme Harry Corbett will act sim
ply as an agent for the San Jose firm of
Osterhout & Co. It is at this place .where
all the betting and- selling will be per
fected.
A scheme has been evolved by which
the poolsellers claim to have outwitted po
lice, ordinance and the letter of the law.
At any rate they will try it to-nlgrht at
Harry Corbett's and test the new and
highly Ingenious plan of accepting money
from bettors as fast as it comes In and
wire the bets to San Jose, where all the
money will be placed.

R. J. Pavert. a contractor and builder,
residing at 686 Castro street, and tenor
soloist of the St. Agnes Church choir, ar
rived here yesterday morning? from Crca
cent City In custody of Sheriff CrawfoM
of Del Norte- County,. and was Immediate
ly placed under arrest for felony In ob
taining: money under false pretense. He
was locked up In the City Prison until the
afternoon, when he was released on $1005
cash ball, furnished by his father-in-law.
Otto Peterson.
Lyon & Hoag, real estate agents, of 115
Montgomery street, are the complaining
parties. They claim to have lost about
J200O through misrepresentations . made ' ' k
them by Pavert. The latter built fl-:X
houses for the real estate firm on Ninth
avenue. In South San Francisco, begin
ning last December. Two of the houses
were properly completed and the material
and labor were paid for by the contractor.
The real estate men claim that they pai<t
him $C00O more on the other three houses
on his representation that he had paid for
all material and labor on them also.
"Pavert brought U3," George F. Lyon
said yesterday, | "waivers of lien from J.
H. Kruse & Co.. the lumber dealers,
whose bills amounted to J2000. and from
Fisher & Co., plumbers, whose bill wa3
$350. He represented that these and all
other bills were paid, and we made our
settlement with him. holding back $500 on
one house, the purchaser of which insist
ed on that protection against mechanics
Hens.
"In June claims against the houses De
gran to be presented. We found that Kruse
and Fisher had not been paid, but gave
the releases on the representation by Pa
vert that he could not get his money from
us to pay them until he could show the
releases He trot the money but ,did not
pay them. Besides, there were the follow
ing unpaid bills: W. P. Fuller & Co., $3.v.
Pacific Manufacturing Company. $lilÂ«:
Lowry & Daly, $213: Sanborn & Vail. $26;
Aigeltineer & Co.. $16; Pacific Gas Com
pany, $ls: Thomas Day. $40."
Lyon & Hoag found that Pavert hart
left town, and they became alarmed and
swore to a complaint in Judge Cabanisa'
court charging him with obtaining money
under false pretense. Pavert was at Can
von City, Or., at that time, visiting rela
tives of his wife. He returned about a
week ago and then went to Crescent City
on business. He was taken Into custody
there at the request of Chief of Detectlvea
Seymour.
Pavert asserts that he Is Innocent of
any crime, and that the trouble was a
case for settlement by civil and not penal
action. He claims that he will pay Kruse
and Fisher & Co.. and that the othrr
liens are covered by the amount withheld ,
by Lyon & Hoag. . Â«-i
Pavert will be arraigned this morning. "

The Warren was to have sailed at noon,
but it was after 3 p. m. before she got
away from the wharf and 4:10 p. m. be
fore she passed Meiggs wharf. She car
ries in her strongroom $1,000,000 in gold,
which is intended for the payment of the
troops now in China. The money is in
charge of Captain P. L. Miles, quarter
master of the Warren. Captain Miles is
one of the youngest quartermasters in
the transport service, but he Is also one of
the most capable. He Is well liked by
everybody on board and there is never a
clash between the quartermaster captain
and the captain, as so frequently happens
on other transports.
Captain F. E. Frazler goes out on his
first trip as master of the Warren. He
was formerly chief officer of the Sheri
dan. When Captain Hart was stricken
with the Illness that carried him oft Cap
tain Pearce of the Sheridan took his place
on the Warren. When Captain Hart died
Frazier was made captain of the Sheri
dan. Then when the Warren came home
Pearce took his old ship and Frazier got
the Warren. ' Captain Frazler Js also a
young man. but a skillful navigator and
most capable seaman. The Warren is the
most reliable boat in the whole transport
service nnd has carried more troops and
stores than any other vessel in the ser
vice. Captain Fra-zier's friends will be
delighted, to hear once more of his pro
motion.
The Aztec, with 474 horses of the Third
Cavalry, grot away at 1 p. m. She goes to
Kobe. The Siam, with stores for the
troops at Honolulu Guam and Manila,
got away at 3 p. m.
IT Is many a day since the transport
wharf presented as busy a scene a~s
yesterday. The transport Warren
sailed with 1143 officers and men for
the Feat of war In China, and thousands
of people, were down to see them off.
Among those who went away were two
FCjuadrons of the Xinth Cavalry
nnd ttitty half of the colored population
of the city was there to bid them god
ppe^d. The visitors overran the ship and
made things lively in allquarters.
Just before the Warren pulled out into !
thÂ© stream the band began playing a Â¦
Cakewalk. In a moment a couple of the j
negro cavalrymen were on the main boom
riancir.g away for all they were worth. I
The contagion spread and in a very short I
ppaee of time a hundred couples were !
"hoeing down" on the quarterdeck of the
eteamer.
Besides the two squadrons of the Ninth '
Infantry the Warren took away 123 driv- '
ers for the mule trains to be put In opera- !
tion in China, All of these men were j
]ir>r-<l up on the wharf before going aboard â¢
and answered rollcall. They are a hardy. !
reckless s^t of fellows and would make :
prood foldiers. Many of them come from j
Texas and Arizona, while some come from !
Ix>wer California and Mexico. All of j
them have been cowboys and it will be a ,
hot day when one of thÂ«*m gets stuck |
with his team. Along with the "cow- j
Ttunchers" went three mechanics and fix i
blacksmiths and wheelwrights. On these !
men will mainly depend the transporta
tion of the supplies for the United States
soldiers now in the field in China.
A detachment of forty-one recruits for
various regiments and 100 recruits for the
Ninth Infantry also sailed on the Warren.
These men were under command of Cap
tain M. L. Hersey and Second Lieutenants
H. E. Mitchell. E. E. Allen and P. K.
Brice. Major F. J. Ives. surgeon U. S. V..
went out In command of a Hospital
Corps consisting of three stewards and
100 privates.
Among those who went out !n the cabin
on the Warren were: Assistant Surgeon
C. Schultze. CT. S. V. ; Major T. V. VameV,
assistant paymaster; Colonel Cochrane,
U. S. M. C. ; Captain George Montgomery,
ordnance department; Captain William H.
Bean, acting assistant surgeon; P. Mc-
Grath, Major W. H. Arthur. F. H. Her
rington and H. M. Robinson and G. M.
Hunt of the postal service.
Major Arthur goes to China to take con
trol of the hospital arrangements at
Taku. He has been the surpeon in charge
of the transports here for several months
and has made a host of friends, all of
whom were down to see him off.
H. M. Robinson and G. M. Hunt are the
advance guard of six clerks who are des
tined to form a traveling postoffiee in
China. The men all arrived from Chi
cago yesterday, but there was no accom
modation on the Warren for them all, so
four of the clerks will follow on the Sher
man, which leaves mÂ»xt Monday week.
The headouarters* of the postal service
will be at Taku. There one clerk will re
main to handle the mail, while the others

"THE ONLY WAY" TO
BE PRODUCED HERE
Record-Breaking Sale Is
Keeping Man in Box i
Office Busy.
1 ACTOR J. H. STODDARD.
THE sale of seats for Henry Miller's
great production, "The Only Way,"
opened yesterday morning at the
Columbia Theater and kept the man
In the box office busy throughout the
entire day. Five thousand dollars'
worth of seats were disposed of. Seats
for the entire six nights commencing next
Monday night and Wednesday and Satur
day matinees were equally in demand
The play had Its first production in New
York at the H/rald-square Theater, and
scored a triumph as instantaneous and
decisive as that made originally in the
English capital. It was a great oppor
tunity for Mr. Miller, and he proved equal
to It. It gave him at a stroke a leading
place among the great theatrical stars.
As Sidney Carton he realized fully the
character of the great novelist.
The veteran actor J. II. Stoddard, Dan
iel H. Harkins, Joseph Brennan and Mar
garet Robinson have come here direct
from New York to appear with Mr. Miller
in this magnificent production.

DUSKY HEROES OF THE NINTH
SAIL FOR THE SEAT OF WAR
Three big windjammers came sailing In
between the heads in company yesterday,
and made as pretty a picture as has ever
been seen In the Golden Gate. The big
four-master Erskine M. Phelps, In a new
coat of white paint, came bowling along
under a full spread of canvas, the Merom,
flying light, followed close at her heels,
while the Santa Clara, loaded down with
salmon, was in close attendance.
The Erskine M. Phelps brings the largest
cargo of sugar ever brought here in one
bottom. She has by actual measurement
6600 tons aboard, or 92.527 sacks. This is
25,000 sacks in excess of what any single
vessel has ever brought to San Francisco.
The Phelps was twenty-flve days coming
from Honolulu, much to the disgust of
Captain Graham. She made a 'splendid
run from Manila to Hawaii and -was the
first American vessel to arrive there after
the islands had been declared a Territory.
Captain Graham sailed his vessel into
Honolulu with every flag in the lockers
set. and received a most hearty, welcome
from everybody in port. Captain Graham
is accompanied by his wife and little
daughter Gladys.
The Merom "Was Ashore.
The bark Merom came back from Nag
Nek leaking. She left here on May 29 and
went on the flats at the entrance of Nag
Nek - harbor about- July 1. There -were
some very heavy forest fires on Bristol
Bay and the whole expanse of water was
covered with a dense smoke, which was
worse than the thickest fog-. The bark
was on the bank two weeks and was then
got off. Part of her keel was gone and
she was leaking at the rate of an inch
an hour, so the captain decided to come
back to San Francisco. He landed his
supplies at Nag Nek and then headed for
home.
The Santa Clara brought down 52.0C0
cases of salmon. The chances are that
both she and the Alerom wil make a return
trip to the canneries. The Merom goea on
the drydock to-day.
Narrowly Escaped Death.
"Eddie Thomas "Williams. 16 years of age,
came very near being- instantly killed In
the chain locker of the transport Aztec
yesterday morning. When Eddie was 6
years old both his parents died, and ever
since the boy has been wanderinp about
the United States. Ills only relative Is a
brother, 24 years of age, who lives at Hon
olulu, and it suddenly entered the boy's
head to ko to him. The Siam touches at
Honolulu, but the Aztec does not.- Eddie
mistook the vessels, however, and got
aboard the Aztec. He hid himself in the
chain locker and went to sleep. The Aztec
did not go to sf-a direct, however, but an
chored in the stream. When the mud
hook was let go the flying chain threw Ed
die in all directions, and when he was
found by the sailors he was more dead
than alive. Early in the morning: the lad
was sent ashore to the Harbor Hospital,
where Dr. Baclgalupi found that his right
ankle was dislocated, his left leg badly
lacerated, his scalp and face lacerated and
various wounds all over his body. Dr.
Bacigalupl thinks the boy will recover.
The Merom Was Ashore in Alaska.

Church declined to give it up except
through legal process, and Gunn & Co.
secured a search warrant from Judge Ca

The case was heard yesterday, and 'the
Judjri decided that Church should deliver
the box to Gunn & Co.. but that it should
be opened in court and its contents ex

SENATOR HOAR IS RIGHT.
Tâ-) OURKE COCKRAN in his letter to the "Lib
\\ erty Congress" convoked by the Anti-Imperial
* â League declares an intention to support Bryan
and dismisses with a show of contempt the statement
of Senator Hoar that even if Bryan be sincere, he
could not, if elected President, check the imperialistic
tendencies of certain elements of his party. There
is thus raised a question of opinion that merits con
sideration. If Cockran be right, any anti-imperialist
who is indifferent to the money question at stake in
the campaign might well support Bryan; but if Sena
tor Hoar be right, then Bryan in the Presidency
would be of no more service to anti-imperialists than
| the proverbial broken reed that wounds the hand that
| leans on it.
i Senator Hoar has had a longer and a fuller expe
rience in Congress than Bourke Cockran, and is
more thoroughly acquainted with the sentiments and
j objects of the leading Democrats in both houses.
His judgment on the subject at issue is therefore more
valuable than that of the man who disputes it. Were
there no evidence to confirm the statement of the
j Senator it would still have more weight with intel
ligent men than the equally unsupported declaration
of the comparatively irresponsible New York orator,
who of recent years has been veering about in poli
tics like a weathercock.
It happens, however, that there is abundant evi
dence to confirm the view taken by Senator Hoar.
Only a few days ago Senator Morgan of Alabama, in
discussing the so-called "paramount issue" with a re
porter of the Washington Post, said: "There is no
paramount issue in any campaign. All the planks in
setted have an interest for some portion of the voters,
and are inserted simply because they are paramount
to some people. To some, one issue is paramount,
'where to others it is of less significance. Whatever
the statement in the Kansas City platform about im
perialism, there arc hardly any two people who would
give similar definitions for imperialism. To some it
would be the right to protect our missionaries in
China, and to others it would be the establishment of
:> government in Porto Rico which was not in com
pliance with the constitution or with the powers of
Congress."
. That is a sufficiently clear notice to all concerned
that Senator Morgan docs not intend to pay much
attention to Bryan's paramount hsue. It is, in fact,
only mother way of stating David B. Hill's comment
on the Kansas City platform, that some of it would
be used in one part of the Union and other portions
of it cTrcwhere.^ Morgan himself will have none of
the pledges, and in the interview from
which we have quoted he asked, evidently with some
bitterness, "When did the Republicans become ex
pansion : ?ts?"

Arguments in the Yolo Suit Against
Controller Colgan in Supreme
Court.
The case of the county of Yolo against
State Controller Colgan was argued yes
terday before the Supreme Court. This Is
only one of many suits which* contem-
plate tho depletion "of the State treasury,
there being about $1,500,000 involved. A
number of attorneys some time ago ocn
cluded that they had discovered sufficient
law to warrant actions being brought by
a number of counties for the payment of
County. Tax Collectors, Auditors, Asses
sors and Treasurers for the collection of
State taxes. Yolo's alleged share would
be abo'ut $23,000. In the lower court the
county lost.
Yesterday Attorney General Ford, rep
resenting the Controller, took the position
that all of these officers mentioned are
also officers of the State and that the law
contemplated that while in the discharge
of their duties as county ofllcials they
were serving the whole people as well
and were not entitled to extra compen
sation. As a further bar against the
contemplated raid on the State treasury
the last Legislature passed an act oblit
erating any alleged obligation to counties
on this aeount and directing that any
suits pending should be dismisesd by the
plaintiffs. .
SUITS OF COUNTIES
ON STATE TREASURY
OUR WRANGLING ALLIES.
OUR allies in the advance of civilization into
China are not showing that mutual trustful
ness which is required to induce something of
a corresponding trustfulness on the part of the Chi
nese, The spokesmen of the various European
powers, while asking the Tsung li Yamen to rely
upon the pledges they make, are themselves refusing
to rely upon the words of one another. There is
everywhere a declaration of intention not to partition
China, and almost everywhere evidences of prepara
tion being made for that very purpose.
William St. John Broderick, Under Secretary of
State for Foreign Atfairs, is reported to have said in
a speech before the Primrose League on Wednesday,
with reference to the landing of British troops at
Shanghai: "We all know that we are determined to
risk everything and to put forward all our strength
and resolution before allowing British interests to
go down in any part of the world." Of course a
speech made under such circumstances is not to be
regarded as a deliberate utterance of the British Min
istry. It was a case of letting the lion roar for th.e
delight of the crowd. Nevertheless, it reveals the
temper of the Government and of the dominant party
in the country, and that temper is one of distrustful
ness toward other powers. Clearly the British be
iieve it will be safer for their interests to have. them
guarded -by troops rather than by the promises of
foreign diplomats.
We. are told that Russia, Germany and France ob
ject to Britain's action at Shanghai and may unite in
a demand that the British troops be withdrawn from
that point. We are also told that Japan and Great
.Britain object to the occupation of Niuchwang by
the Russians, and may unite in demanding a with
drawal of the Russian troops. That makes a very
pretty situation in itself, but there is another com
plication to come along very soon. , Germany has a
strong force of men on the way to China, and when
they arrive we may hear of a combination objecting
to their landing.
In the midst of this imbroglio the United States
stands neutral, and doubtless where the ground is so
slippery that is ihe only way of standing at all. It
is rapidly becoming a serious question, however,
whether there is' to remain any neutral ground to
stand on. China is either to-be partitioned or it h
not. If i't is to be partitioned we shall have to get out
and stay at home until the ruction is over or else take
part in th,e fighting; and if it is not to be. partitioned
we shall probably have to call the hands of our Brit
ish cousins and our ancient friends the Russians and
threaten them with fearful things if they persist in the
land grabbing.
Taken altogether, the prospect that something un
expected will happen is very good: France willsoon
have closed up her exposition,' Great Britain will be
free of the war in South Africa. Germany willhave her
big fleet well under way, and, Russia will have her
Siberian railway, completed. Thus all will be pre
pared and ready to welcome the glorious dawn of the
twentieth century 'with. a war worthy, of the new e-a.

A testimonial benefit was tendered yes
terday afternoon at the Alcazar Theater
to* the popular young actress Miss Lafira
Crews on the occasion of her departure
for the East. "Only the- Master Shall
Blame" and "Keeping Up Appearances"
were presented, and the applause through
out the performance, here, there and
everywhere, with a charming disregard
for anything but the expression of good
feeling toward the popular ingenue, made
it almost impossible to proceed with the
play at times. Miss Crews made the very
prettiest of tiny farewell speeches, grace
ful, unstudied and a little tearful, thank-
Ing audience and actors for their kind ap
preciation. Flowers in abundance were
sent over the footlights, and the kindly
testimonial will doubtless not soon be for
gotten by the young recipient, even In the
midst of all the New York triumphs
which her admirers hope and prophesy
for her.
TESTIMONIAL BENEFIT
TO MISS LAURA CREWS
THE REWARD Of FIDELITY.
W'lTIIIN the next few days Republican pri
maries will be held throughout the State, and
it is therefore timely to remind the party cf
the duty it owes to the men ;vho in the last Legisla
ture stood iirmiy for the honor of the party against
ail the banded bosses of corruption could do to in
duce them to dishonor Republicanism and disgrace
California by the election of a railroad candidate of
ihe lowest type to the United States tTenate.
Of the men who during that long fight remained
true to the party, the people and the State, many are
seeking re-election. Some who were then in the As
sembly are now candidates for the Senate. Each and
every one of those men should be elected. It is j.
duty loyal Republicans owe to them in recognition of
their fidelity and of their important service to the
party and to California, It is not too much to say
that by defeating the schemes of the railroad and the
would-be bosses the stalwart Republicans of the .Leg
islature saved California to the Republican party in
this election. Had the railroad captured the Legis
lature, had it sent to the United States Senate a man
of the type* of Dan Burns, there would be such a re
volt against the party the Democrats would now have
something like a walkover.
The Southern Pacific Company has a long memory
and a malignant one. Orders have been given to defeat
every honest Republican who bafiled the scheme to
elect a railroad Senator. Those orders will be served
by even' corrupt boss to whom the)' are sent. It is
â¢ known that in this city the Democrats as well as the
so-called Republican bosses are working with the
railroad. It is Kerrin, Crimmins, Kelly and the whole
gang this time. Much the same condition of affairs
prevails elsewhere. Therefore it is the duty of Re
publicans to now support the men who when in office
supported Republicanism against railroad domination.
One good turn deserves another. The representative
was faithful to the party and the party should be faith
ful to him.
In localities where Herrin despairs of electing a
pliant railroad tool he may induce a good man to run
against the candidate whom he desires to beat. In
such case the victory would not profit him much, but
he would have had revencre and would have shown
that the people cannot be relied upon to support faith
ful men in office. Against such tactics Republicans
must be on p;uard. No matter how excellent be the
candidate pat forward to do the railroad's work in
this fight, he should be defeated.
The issue is a plain one. Certain Republicans in
the last Legislature were true to themselves, to thÂ«:r
principles, to their constituents, to their party and to
the State. They refused to yield to the demands of
the Southern Pacific corporation and disreputable
bosses in this city. They won a fi^ht for honesty by
a victory of which every Republican is proud, and
pent to the United States Senate a man the whole
State deliphts to henor. Now, for revenge and spite,
the corrupt forces that were beaten :n the Senatorial
fi?ht are trying to defeat every one of those honest
Republicans who is seeking re-election. The issue is
up to the rank and file of the party. There is no way
to evade it. The defeat of a sinpie man who in office
Â¦was true to Republicanism will he a wrong that will
shame the constituency that permits it.
A Santa Cruz murderer is seriously concerned that
a wound in his neck will rot heal in time for the

jTJson their crime ought to sufrgest 'he necessity of
enacting laws which will protect society from injuries
inflicted in unnatural deviltry.
Democratic orators arc now. telling us all about
the "paramount issue" of the campaign. And it is a
safe wajrer that even they do not know of what they
arc speaking.

Received Bogus Cablegram Bearing
Mayor Phslan's Name Offering
Him the Position.
Some one played a practical joke on J.
J. Flinn, the well-known member of the
firm of Flinn & Treacy, a few days ago
which cost that individual just $22 for a
cable message. Shortly after the death
of Supervisor Helms Flinn received a ca
blegram purporting to come from Pari3
and bearing the name of Mayor Phelan
who is touring the Continent. The mes
sage read: "Would position on board
made vacant by death of Helms be ac
ceptable to you?"
No sooner had Flinn read the cable
pram 1 than he dispatched the following
answer to Mayor Phelan: "Will be de
lighted to accept the honor so graciously
offered in your cable message just re
ceived."
Some time after the Mayor's secretary,
Charles Fay, received a letter from his
chief, in which he said that he had never
made any such proposition to Flinn, and
asked what it was all about anyhow. It
was then that the joke was disclosed and
Flinn discovered that he had been clev
erly trapped into paying out money for a
forlorn hope. He quietly left town on a
fishing expedition to escape the chaffing
of his friends. ,
The vacancies in the board will moat
likely remain unfilled until the return of
his Honor from his sojourn on the ConÂ»
tinent, which will be in about two weeks.

of the snake dance festival, with the
writhing reptiles held between the teeth of
the dancing priests and wriggling around
in all directions, were shown. When It Is
understood that the snakes are of the rat

be better realized. -A very happy descrip

GOOD FOR CITY flND STflTE.
WHILE the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners have postponed action on the proposed
lease of China Basin to the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railroad, there is every reason
for expecting a favorable decision at the next meet
ing, which is to take place on Monday. To the
recommendation of the Board of Supervisors there
has now been added that of tfie Merchants' Associa
tion, so that the Commissioners have before them
ample evidence that both the officials and the business
men of the city regard the lease as highly desirable
from every point of view. There are differences of
opinion as to some of the details of the lease, but
upon the essential point of granting an ample ter
minus in the city to the Valley Road there are no dif
ferences whatever among progressive men.
The statement of the issue in the communication of
the Merchants' Association is clear and emphatic.
After suggesting the advisability of making certain
changes in the proposed- terms of the lease, the mer
chants say: "With the correction of these provisions
in the lease we believe that its execution would prove
to the best interests cf the city of San Francisco an-i
the State of California. The improvement of China
Basin and the construction of this section of the sea
wall would give impetus to the improvement of the
entire water front. It is estimated that these improve
ments will involve an expenditure of $1,000,000, of
which about $.250,000 must be expended in the con
struction of the seawall within a period of five years.
This consideration, together with the rental of $1000
per annum, as stipulated in the lease, appears to be
sufficient to warrant the execution of the lease with
the certainty that the seawall will revert to the State
as soon as it can be utilized. We therefore hope that
the pending negotiations between your honorable
board and the San Francisco and San Joaquin Val
ley Railway Company relative to the proposed lease
of China Basin will result in an agretment that will
insure the construction of the contemplated improve
ments promising to'be of such material benefit to the
State of California."
The sum and substance of the matter is that San
Francisco needs the improved transportation facili
ties the proposed terminus will give, and needs also
the increased dockage that will result from the im
provements the Valley Road will make. Where there
is so much to "be pained for the city and the State it
would be foolish to impose unfair conditions, upon
the company that is to provide the improvements and
the competitive transportation. It is therefore to be
hoped a complete agreement will be reached on Mon
day. The sooner the work of improvement is begun
the better it will be for all concerned.

Owing to the large number of men in
China and the Philippines requiring treat
ment it has been decided to establish a.
hospital at Nagasaki with accommoda
tions for 500 patients, and another at some
point in China with beds for 1000. The
hospital In China will probably be located
in Tientsin or Shanghai. :.;,C.

surgeon, U. S. A., will also sail on the
Sherman to take charge of the base hos
pital to be established these. Major John
Van R. HofC roes to China and will as
sume charge of the hospital to be estab
lished either in Shanghai or Tientsin.
So great Is the need of doctors that the
medical department has determined to ap
point one hundred more acting assistant
surgeons. There have been assigned with
in the last few daya for duty in the Phil
ippines thirty-six doctors, twelve of Â¦whom

THE IRRIGATION DEBATE,
a^HE Waters' and Forests' Association of this
Â§ State has been quietly collecting the means and
preparing the plans for an extended educational
discussion of the ownership and use of the flood
waters. The storage of storm water in some form is
tiie solution of the problem of securing more water
to irrigate more land. Within this is the no lest im
portant question of using existing facilities for irri
gation by inducing the people to irrigate, informing
them in methods and convincing them of the value
such policy may develop.
In certain districts where this lesson has been
learned by experience the only want felt is for more
water. Lying in touch with lands already developed
and in profitable action is just as good soil waiting
for water. Its value now is nominal. When the
wherewithal to make it fruitful is attainable that value
will enormously increase, and the resulting output
will be a needed contribution to the commerce of the
State.
Such districts have an immediate interest in the in
crease and reliability of the water supply. To secure
this a variety of plans may be put in concurrent ac
tion. The storm waters may be diverted and stand
in the soil itself, relying upon the retention of mois
ture by the subsoil and its availability by capillary at
traction. There may also be storage by the locking
of a supply in canyons for use throughout the season,
and its distribution may be arranged for by methods
to be developed by the discussion which is intended to
prepare public sentiment for impression upon
the next Legislature.
Intimately connected with the conservation of water
is the preservation of the forests. So far this sum
mer the destruction of the forests by fire has gone on
unchecked. Not only in the Coast Range but in the
best timbered sections of the Sierras the fires have
rioted unchecked. The smoke has been so thick that
its pungent quality has been irritating to the eyes
and air passages of passengers on the railroad. Vast
tracts of virgin timber have been destroyed and great
rrcas covered by a promising second growth have
been turned to stretchts of black ashes, never to re
cover their tree-producing capacity.
The greater part of this is the work of criminally
careless campers and hunters. The cigarette is a
fruitful source of forest fires. The dirty little roll of
tobacco and opium is thrown into the dry grass and
soon lights a conflagration. The season has been
fotaily favorable to fit es, because the growth of grass
was very rank and the dry season has turned it into
tinder. The mountain people are looking forward
anxiously for the September rains, which will ex
tinguish conflagrations that are raging and render
fresh ones less likely.
We are more than ever convinced that something
must be done by the State and local authorities to
stop this annually increasing destruction of the
Slate's future.
The whoie question of the proper harvesting of tim
ber and preservation of the growing forest is directly
related to agriculture, the State's greatest permanent
interest. An acre of forest permanently destroyed
means finally an acre barren and fruitless. This result
\z inevitable. The connection is direct, and the dam
p.ge susceptible of proof.
We have no doubt that it will be found that the
harvesting of timber in the mountains is just as sub
ject to judicial control as is hydraulic mining, and for
the same reason, its relation to agriculture in the val
leys.
But what shall control the fires and punish the for
est incendiaries? The State Fish and Game Commis
sion appoints game wardens, who keep a very good
oversight of hunters that they do not kill game out of
season. Why not by law increase the number of these
wardens and make of them a forest constabulary, to
watch the hunters and' others who by carelessness set
these fires? Such a plan may be found feasible and
possibly effective.
One is appalled at this waste going on year after

Holds That the Mere Fact of Marry,
ing Does Not Render Women
Improper Parsons to v Â¦
Teach School.
\ â , â
The Board of Education received an
opinion yesterday from City Attorney
Lane, In which he holds that those reg
ularly elected teachers who were in the
department prior to the going- into effect
of the charter are not subject to removal
under a rule of the department declaring
their positions vacant upon marriage. The
opinion says:
The charter limits the power of the board as
to dismissals by the following- provision.
".But no teacher in the department at the
time of the adoption of this charter or who
chall be hereafter appointed shall be dismissed
from the department except for insubordina
tion, immoral or unprofessional conduct or evi
dent unntn. ss for teaching."
This provision was incorporated into the
charter for the purpose of securing to the
members of the department permanent tenure
except for the causes designated. Those teach
ers who were in the department when the char
ter went into effect remain in the department
under the charter unless they are dismissed for
insubordination, immoral or unprofessional con
duct or evident unfltness for teaching. Unless
marriage while in the department comes under
one of these heads' it is not a cause for re
moval.
It will not be contended, I presume, that the
mere fact of marriajre renders a woman unfit
for teachlnK or that by marrying she is guilty
of Immoral or unprofessional conduct. These
grounds of dismissal being eliminated from
consideration there remains to consider but that
of "insubordination." this word is denned by
the lexicographers a3 "disobedience to lawful
authority." The rule of the board does not
Inhibit marriage. Therefore no rule has been
broken and there is no ground for dismissal on
a charge of insubordination.
It may be said that while the rule of the
board Joes not deny the right to marry it does
deny the right to continue in the department
after marriage. It attempts to do this, to be
sure, but It fails because it la not within the
power of the board to arid a new cause for dis
missal to those set forth in the charter, which
are In general terms those stated in the code.
(Political Code. Sec. 1T'J3.) To say that a
teacher may be ousted from the department by
a rule of the board is to say that a teacher
may be ousted for any cause that the board
may Â«ee fit to incorporate into a ruleâ a position
at variance with the positive law. The board
has power to make rules reculatintc the de
partment, prescribing hours of attendance, the
character of the work to be performed an<i such
other rules as will tend to bring the depart
ment under good system and discipline, but it
cannot make a rule that a teacher's position
shall become vacant when she marries, be
cause her marriage is not a matter of school
department business and the causes for -which
she may lose her position have been set forth
in the law, in conformity with which al! rules
must be- made. (Kennedy vs. Board of Educa
tion, S2 Cal. 4S9.)

j Bryan but ridiculing the platform. The Atlanta Con
j stitution goes further. In defiance of the platform and
j in the face of Bryan's, speech of acceptance, it has
stated in an elaborate editorial that the Democratic
party is not opposed to holding the Philippines. In
ieply to a statement by the Washington Post on the
subject, the Constitution says: "The Post is distinctly
not an organ, and therefore it is regrettable to see it
holding on to the fag-end of a Republican roorback
to the effect that Mr' Bryan and the Democratic party
weie in favor of withdrawing our troop's from the
Philippines and turning the islands over to the terror
ana confusion that would result from Aguinaldo's
dictatorship. As a matter of. fact, no Democrat of
an;, prominence or influence, so far as we know, has
ever dreamed of subscribing to such a proposition."
Theie, then,- is the whole point at issue between
Senator Hoar and Mr. Cockran. The Atlanta Con-
Etituiicn does not know of a single prominent Demo
crat who is opposed to holding the Philippines. Sup
pose, then, Bryan were elected,* what could he do
against the demand of the Southerners for that im
perialism abroad which they are practicing at home
by the suppression of the negro vote?

SUSPENSION OF
VICE PflllCIPM.
AN ILLEGAL ACT
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 17, 1900.
6
Superintendent "Webster made the state
ment yesterday that the suspension of
Ebenezer Knowlton. vice principal of the*
Everett School. was clearly illegal.
Knowlton was suspended recently by
Chairman Mark of^the Board of Educa
tion under a rule adopted by the board
which provides that "when a teacher haa
been reported as Incompetent or as j.-uilry
of unprofessional, insubordinate or Im
moral conduct the Superintendent op
president of the board shall ;u once sus
pend such teacher from service, without
pay, pending the investigation and final
disposition of such report or charge."
This rule is held by Superintendent
Webster to be In direct conflict with tha
charter, which empowers the Beard at
Education only to elect, promote and dis
miss teachers for cause. No power la
vested in the board to suspend a teacher.
Webster says the action of the board is
an infringement on the life tenure oÂ£
teachers and a dangerous menace to tha
rights guaranteed to them by the Stata
law.
"Webster further contends that he alone)
has the right to recommend the trial of
an accused teacher. Some time ago
vague charges were filed against Knowl
ton by Individuals who 'would not starul
by them and Webster ruled that the
charges were not sustained. On June 20
Miss Frances Panning, principal of the
Kverett School, filed a statement against
Knowlton In which she repeated the
charges and thereupon Mark suspended,
the vice principal, to make room, it Is
said, for Seldon Sturpris. who was con
solidated out of the John Swett School
when the vice principals of the primary
schools "\rere reduced from two to one In
number. Â« Knowlton reports daily for duty
and will shortly file a statement with tha
board in response to that of Miss Ban
ning. Should he fall of reinstatement ha
â¢will take the matter into court.

Thomas T. Townsend, former husband
of the late Mrs. Almlra S. Townsend, has
opened his fight for a portion of the de
cedent's estate. Proceeding on the con
tention that he was the legal husband
of tho deceased at the time of her death,
he filed an application yesterday for let
ters of administration upon her estate.
As surviving husband of the deceased
Townsend claims the right to administer
her estate and will force his claim to. a
hearing.
Townsend has retained the services of
Attorney G. Gunzendorfer to pros-scute
his claim. In the petition he llrst sets
forth the fact of Mrs. Townsend's death
and the fn.ct that she left property valued
at ?500,0CO. lie further says that he Is 71
years of age and has resided in this city
lor many years past. No reference is
made to the proceedings by which Mrs.
Townaend obtained a divorce from him
years ago, the right to letters being based
on the one assertion that the petitioner
is the surviving husband of the deceased.
Though no reference is made to the di
vorce proceedings it Is understood that
their regularity will be attacked by Mr.
Townsend. If this course is taken by
him he will immediately become an Im
portant factor in the coming litigation
over the 'estate. If it be proved that the
decree was Illegally procured by Mrs.
Townsend then, under the law. he will be
entitftt tO | succeed to one-half of the
estate. Records of Eastern courts will be
searched by qualified .commissioners, and
though Townsend may be defeated in the
end. if he persists in forcing his claim. It
will be years before the order for the
tinal distribution of Mrs. Townsend's
wealth will stand on the record.
Mrs. Ella F. Murray's application for
letters of administration upon the estate

forth If Choynski could hold him re
sponsible for the fee the lady owed him.

Strickert got the license.
They were married. Choynski Informed
Attorney M. H. Hernan, who represented
Strickert in the breach of promise suit,
that he believed he was entitled to a
fee, and he placed his price at 1250. Strick
ert offered Choynski. through his attor
ney, a nominal fee. Choynski spurned the
offer and waited a chance to get even.
He is of opinion that the chance has ar
rived.
Mr. and Mrs. Strickert went to dwell
together, but last Tuesday Mrs. Strickert
filed suit for divorce, alleging cruelty as
cause of action. To prosecute her case
George I* Hughes appeared. Again had
Ohoynski been slighted.
He closeted himself with Judge Dalnger
field and laid before the court his sus
picion that collusion existed between Mr.
and Mrs. Strickert. Judge Daingerfleld
appointed him amicus curiaÂ© forthwith, in
order that he might continue his investi
gations as an officer of the court. Judge
Daingerfleld informed Choynski that if he
proved that collusion existed a motion
made by him that the decree of divorce be
pet aside would be entertained by. the
court and the suffering litigants be forced
to live together or apart if they chose, but
as man and wife, as punishment for the
deception which they had practiced on the
court.
Late Wednesday afternoon the case was
called for hearing and Mrs. Strickert pro
ceeded to prove her case. She testified
that Strickert was in the habit of pinch
ing her and punching her and cursing her.
These facts she proved to the satisfaction
of the court. A decree was entered and
silence again reigned until yesterday
when Attorney Choynski made angry ap
pearance on the scene.

Political Conditions in 1800.
From the Government point of view the
nineteenth century will be notable in all
future history as the era of the triumph of
democracy. The beginning of the move
ment for political liberty dates back to j
the early medieval period of European j
historj't but a review of conditions at the ;
opening of this century shows that the >
long struggle had resulted In the establish- j
ment of self-government in only two na- j
tlons. Great Britain had established a i
Parliamentary government on a sure j
basts, and building on foundations of Eng- i
lish- precedent America had erected a sta- I
ble republic before 1S00. France had passed i
through a whirlwind of fire and blood In a i
desperate attempt to realize the ideals of !
"liberty, equality and fraternity," but just
BS the century opened Napoleon wrested |
from the unhappy nation the doubtful
freedom which it had bought at a price !
which appalled humanity, and the repub- !
lie was crushed Tby a military despotism
as absolute as the regime of Louis XIV.
A review of the rest of the world shows '
the monarchical principle firmly enthroned
save in little Switzerland.
The Triumph, of Democracy.
As we look abroad to-day at the close of
the century we see self-government estab
lished In more or less perfect measure In
every civilized country of the world save
Russia. Among the great nations Amer
ica and Great Britain now stand as types
of the most perfect democracy that the
world has seen since the days of ancient :
Greece. In those countries where the mon
archical institutions still exist the royal
prerogative Is very narrowly limited, and
the will of the people finds full expression
in free Parliaments. The final establish
ment of government by the people
throughout the largerÂ«part of the civilized
W 2f ! u Is Â« the crownin ? glory -of a century
which Is resplendent with glorious
achievements in every field of human ac-
The general process of democracy which
has characterized our century has'worked
under widely different conditions in dif
ferent countries, and to follow its action
we must glance briefly at the govern
mental development of a few important
nations.
The Development of the United
States.
In America the opening of the century
round government by the people in suc
cessful operation under the present con
: stitution. For nearly a quarter of a cen
tury the United States had been an inde
pendent republic under the declaration of
li.fi. and for a decade it had enjoyed ef
ficient national government. Still the po
litical philosophers of the day felt that
republican government in America was
an experiment of doubtful issue. The
modern world showed no other Instance
of such government except the little r<v
public of Switzerland, and the stability of
democracy on a large scale was yet to be
proved.
But, although they were pioneers in a
perplexing field, the framers of our con
stitution succeeded in establishing a gov
ernment on such wise lines that the fun
damental law has required very few for
mal changes during more than a century
of growth. Nevertheless, while the form
of the constitution has remained practi
cally unaltered, our Government has been
changing constantly in spirit and method.
By ever broadening interpretation of the
written constitution the system has been
adjusted to changing demands. Thus the
republic of 10<v> differs widely from the
republic of 1S00. although its fundamental
law has been amended very slightly. The
great change which has been wrought
may be best expressed as the evolution
from a virtual aristocracy to a real dem
ocracy.
From Aristocracy to Democracy.
It is commonly believed that the found
ers of our nation were ardent advocates
of democratic equality. That this is a
mistaken conception appears from an ex
amination of the' form of government
which they established when they had
achieved independence. In the first place
the laws of the various States greatly re
stricted the voting privilege. . Universal
manhood suffrage was not an eighteenth
century idea even in liberty-loving Amer
ica. It was the fashion for political lead
ers to declare that the voice of the people
is the voice of God, but they wanted to
select the people. A glance at the Fed
eral constitution also shows how far were
the revolutionary statesmen from Implicit
confidence in the people. For instance,
the original electoral-college system of
choosing the President was an attempt
to secure an aristocratic, not a demo
cratic choice. The provision for the se.
lection of Senators by State Legislatures
Is a Bimilar Instance of lack of faith la
direct popular action.
But the century was still young when
the people asserted their right to ruuku
direct choice or. their ITesiUent and dis
covered a way to do this under the con
stitution by the device of pledged electors.
Next they took into their hands the nomi
nation of their candidates for the Presi
dency. At first nominations had, been
made by Congressional caucus, but
clamor for a more democratic choice sus
pended this method after Is24. and. after a.
period of confusion, therp developed about
1840 the present representative national
convention. Meantime property quallrica
tlons and other restrictions on the suf
frage were disappearing, and the political
parties were organizing on the primary
plan of representation.
These devolpments are simply sympto
matic of the development of a spirit of
extreme democracy, which demanded that
this should be as direct a Government by
all the people as it was possible to ar
range. The latest manifestation of this
spirit is the widespread agitation for the
introduction of the referendum on a plan
similar to that employed in Switzerland.
Many political scientists believe that we
In America have gone too fast and too far
on this road toward the most extreme
democracy. They believe that restriction.*
f>n the suffrage which would exclude the
ignorant and unstable element of our
present citizenship would insure better
Government. But this academic discus
sion has no apparent Influence on, practi
cal politics. Democracy is Indeed
triumphant in America, and the solution
of our difficulties must come through the
education of this democracy.
Democracy in Great Britain.
As we tuA to Great Britain to note the
development of a century, wp are con
sidering the country which first estab
lished self-government in the modern
world. For 600 years and more before th<Â»
beginning of our century the people of
Kngland had steadily pressed toward a
free Parliamentary Government. During
the seventeenth century they had be
headed one King and exiled another who
had attempted to rule without the consent
of the poverned. Durlnsr the century pre
ceding 1 our own the Cabinet system waa
perfected and the responsibility of Min
isters to the House of Commons was
clearly defined.. The crown had been
brought under control of the popular will
as expressed in Parliament, and th*Â»
House of Lords had lost the larger part
of its influence before 1S0O. The House of
Commons was thus the real sovereign of
Enerland.
Nevertheless Kngland was not a democ
racy at the beginning of our century. The
real governing body, the House of Com
mon.", did not represent the people r>f
England. A vicious system of electing
members of the House deprived great
masses of the people of all voice In tha
Kovernment and gave into the hands of Â¦
few rich land owners the power to appoint
a majority of the members of the Com
mons. Reform of the representation sys
tem be^an with the preat act of 1S32. and
was perfected by subsequent acts of 15K8
and 1SS4. The wrong of centuries wa*
thus righted and the House of Commons
began to refiect fairly the opinions of the
British people. The reform of the repre
sentation was the one thing needful to
make the government of Great Britain a
real democracy, and thus the last battJo
of the greatest struggle for political lib
erty In all history was won in, our cen

Kepublicanism in France.
The nation which stands beside tfci
ITnited States as the second greatest re
public in the world has had a stormy
governmental history during the last 10Q
years. The first republic established by
I the French Revolution was just yielding
to the absolutism of Napoleon when tho
century began. When Napoleon was con
quered by the allied armies of Europe in
I 1S15 France was handed back to the Bour
| bons, and remained a monarchy until tho
i great wave of popular revolution which
i swept Europe In IStS drove Louis Philippe
from the throne and brought Louis Na
poleon to the front as the President of
the second republic. Following closely In
the footstep? of hl3 uncle, the great N'a
poletrn. the President of France speedily
tn'J'e himself the Emperor of the French,
and it required the convulsion of tha
Franco-Pru3sian war of 1S71 to overthrow
the empire and pet up the third republic.
The parliamentary system thus estab
lished has endured for a generation, but
its existence has seemed so precarious at
times that if France were the only ex
emplar of republican government the ene
mies of this system would have some Jus
tification for repeating to-day the grave
forecasts of failure which were so common
a century ago when our own free govern
ment was In the experimental stage.

the man on horseback who will override
republican institutions and revive tha
monarchy.

PROGRESS OF- GOVERNMENT IN 100 YEARS,
CHOYNSKI CHARGES COLLUSION
IN STRICKERT DIVORCE CASE
Tangled Ending
of Latigatnoe
Because Fee
Was Unpaid.
After Strickert found that it was use
less to attempt to negotiate the matter
he filed an answer to the complaint, in
which he set forth that he waa willing at
any time to marry the young woman
who wanted $23,000 of his money. . Then
Having implicit faith In Strickert, she
alleged, as well as a full store of ignor
ance regarding American customs, she
lived with him up to six months before
the filing of her suit, when she discov
ered that he had deceived her. Her prayer
to him that he marry her and thus atone
for the wrong he had done her went un
heeded, and she demanded that his gold
pay for his deceit.
In her complaint the then Miss Rach
pauer. who is 19 years of age, alleged
that she came to this city from her home
In Germany three years ago. believing 1
herself to. be the affianced wife of Paul
Strickert On her arrival here she met
Strickert, and on his statement that no
regular ceremony was required under
California laws and that a mere agree
ment to live as husband and wife was
sufficient, she assumed the relation of
wife to him.
Several months ago there was filed In
the office of the County Clerk a complaint
for breach of promise, in which Martha
Rachpauer appeared as plaintiff and Paul
Strickert defendant.
Choynski, with Martha Rachpauer that
was for a client and with a good breach
of promise case prepared, was making an
assault on Strickert's pocketbook. The
sum demanded from Strickert for the
wron ?or d /SJ: 6 the f ormer Miss Rachpauer
was $25,000. When things got too warm
for Strickert he cheated Choynski's hope
for a big fee by marrying the girl. Now
Mrs. Strickert has again blasted Choyn
ski s hope by hiring another lawyer to
frte her from the unhappy married life
into which Choynski generated her This
is the reason Choynski mutters "double
cross," and Is operating as amlcus cu
ria e.
e=jf=JHE ardent wooing, the breach of
promise suit, the wedding, the lltl
11 cation and now the divorce of Paul
Strlckcrt by his wife, Martha Strickert,
has brought up the whole Btory with re
newed and added Interest. Attorney Her
bert Choynski appears in the background
of this lastâ the dlvorco proceedingâ and
he is Faying things about the "double
cross," "bunko" and "ungratefulness."
Armed with authority as amlcus curlae,
he asserts that he will prove that Martha
and Paul Strickert were guilty. of collusion
in the divorce proceedings. This done,
Choynski will see that the decree of di
vorce granted lute "Wednesday evening by
Judge Dalneerfield Is set aside and that
Paul and Martha remain as man and
wife, whether they will or no. And all of
this is because Choynski is out his fee,
which he says he earned when he brought
Strickert to the altar to wed the woman
v.ho has just divorced him.

Nnu York Metal Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â A decline of 10s for
tin in London was reported to-day. Our mar
ket eased somewhat in sympathy with this
factor and closed weak in tone at $31 50. Lak?
copper was a ehade higher in the local mar
ket despite a decline of "s 6d abroad, and
closed firmer in tone at $16 fi2H for lake and
$16 50 for electrolytic and casting copper. The
decline in London was due to the poor half
monthly statement, showing a heavy increase
!n supplies. Spelter, while easy In tone, was
not quotably lower, closing on the basis of
$4 17',4!?4 22H and lead ruled dull at $4 25. Iron
was weak and unsettled. Pig iron warrants
were nominally quoted at $11. Structural iron
was reduced ?8 per ton. The brokers' price for
lead was $4 and for copper $16 75.
New York^Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â The cotton markst
opened quiet and steady, with prices 1 point
to 4 points lower, and sank 3 to 6 points further
under quite active selling of long cotton, pres
sure from the bear side and disappointing late
cables from the late English market. The de
pression was short lived, however. Prices ad
vanced rapidly on brisk general buying. In
the last half-hour the market broke under
liquidation. At the close the market ruled
steady in tone with prices 4@9 points net
higher.

London Market.
NEW YORK.. Aug. 16.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was quite brisk here to-day. In the
early hour the tone was good, easing off a
little in the afternoon. The approach of the
relief expedition to Peking Is absolutely disre
garded. The talk is all of money now. The
stock market expects easy rates, but the bank
ers say that this is a passing phase which has
already been discounted. London continued to
purchase American shares until New York
selling checked the movement.
Paris allowed Tlntos to relapse sharply. This
was regarded as a trick.
The bank bought Â£682.000 gold in bars and
expects to-morrow to receive Â£600,000 from the
Eastâ gold which has been concealed In quar
antine.
The bank commenced borrowing money to
day.
Fortnightly statistics in copper show an In
crease of 21S2 tons In the stock on hand, an
increase of 3537 tons in the supply. On this
report copper shares relapsed.

CHICAGO. Aug. 16.-With a half-filled pit,
colorless news and conjectures and a certain
amount of draggy liquidation the trade in
wheat furnished a good antithesis for excite
ment. The market was decidedly flat and un
interesting. September opened a shade over
ye?terday at 74};#74%c principally In sympathy
with ccrn. Liverpool . was merely steady for
futures and easy for spot. Paris, after a holi
day, was oft equal to lc. There was no cash
demand to speak of; outsiders had apparently
forgotten that this market existed and thÂ»
scalper alone plW his little trade most of the
pecpion. , Bull traders maile an attempt at the
start to hold the market, but they made no
support. One interest threw half a million
into the pit and the market slid oft. This
bundle being disposed of, wheat in smaller lots
came tumbling in and as a result September,
after being checked for a moment on the fall-
Ing Western receipts, finally sagged to 73%c@
73%c. The close was weak, September lc lower
at 72?;c.
There was more nervousness than activity
about the corn market. The tone was firm
throughout. September closed at 3ST'Â»c, %c over l
yesterday.
Oats were quiet but steady, helped by the
corn firmness. September closed a shade lower
at 21%'522c.
Provisions were dull and Irregular, pork
woak, lard steady and short ribs easy. Lard
was in good demand by cash people and fur
nished support to other products, but pork
was unable to withstand the selling pressure
of packers. September pork closed 20c lower,
lard unchanged and ribs 2V4@5c down.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
It was reported on the street yesterday that
the hot wave of a week or ten days ago cut
off the Bellflower crop around WatsonviUe and
Santa Cruz about 75 per cent and other varie
ties about 40 per cent.
It Is very cold and foggy In San Francisco
now and the fruit market is feeling the effects
of the unfavorable weather. Stocks of all
kinds are heavy, but choice Pears are quoted
very firm at $25 per ton. This is the firmest
fruit on the list as far as canning stock is
concerned, as Peaches are weak and more or
less neglected by the canners, unless they can
get Â¦ concessions from sellers. Grapes and
Melons are still kept down by the cold weather.

Dried Fruits, Ntits and Raisins.
The Prune situation is getting Interesting. It
was thought that the association might name
prices Saturday, but yesterday it was reported
that it might postpone the matter still another
week. While some growers are undeniably In
convenienced by this delay It is unquestionable
that the great mass are benefited, for in view
of the pronounced firmness of the dried fruit
market the longer the prices are kept back the
higher they will open. As the season advances
It becomes more and more apparent that tha
yield of fruits in this State this year is turning
out shorter than expected a month or two ago.
nnd what applies to Peaches and Pears applies
as well to Prunes. The drying thus far shows
that the shrinkage this year will be much
greater than the normal, running up to 3 to 1
in many instances, and this of course will cut
down the weight of the crop, while the number
of Prunes remains the same. As for a crop
of 1LO.OCO.000 pounds, this Is cut of the ques
tion, in view of the drop and shrinkage. The
association has a delicate task before it in
fixing the prices. The market is entirely
cleaned up of Prunes, both here and in the
East, and the Weather Bureau reports a very
l'Kht yield in Oregon. The opportunity for
pood prices In unusually propitious this year,
though more or less outside pressure may be
brought against the association to induce it to
set low quotations. If the results to the grower
are satisfactory this year the Apricot growers
may unite next year.

QBERLIN, Aug.' 16.â Herr Krupp will be
gin practice August 23 with cannon shoot-
fÂ± FTER the strained sentimentality
II and commonplace dialogue of
try "Heartsease." the humor, genuine
I though fantastic, and tho occasion
ally brilliant writing of "The Ad
venture of the Lady Ursula" come as a
welcome change. This is the last play In
which Miss Anglin Is to appear this soa
son, and those who remember her charm
ing characterization of the heroine last
year looked forward with pleasant an
ticipation to the revival of the piece last
night at the Columbia. This" anticipa
tion was not disappointed, for Miss Anc
lin has Improved upon what was alreadv
an excellent rendition. The objectionable
business of the first act has Pntlrely dis
appeared and the masqueradingR in man's
attire were managed with a delicacy that
was conspicuously absent from the recent
performances of the Wycherley play at
tho Alcazar. In the climax of tho third
act-a most dimcult oneâ Miss Anglin
showed a capacity, for tragic effects that
makes one think she Is bound to accom
plish something distinguished even in
Shakespearean roles, should she ever enre
to attempt them. Mr. Miller as Sir
ueorge Sylvester was as good as last
year; he could not have been better If
the matineo girls must adore himâ and I
suppose they must-let them bo told that
he really appears to much better advan
tage in this character than he does as
Eric Temple. True, In this play love lies
not In his eye so beaming, but there are
more things In heaven and earth than
are dreamed of in the philosophy of love
Mr. Morgan had only a little partâ and
did little with it. That Is not good art
for whatever is worth doing is worth do
ing well. Witness Mr. Lamb as Old
Qullton, a distinct and original charac
ter study, with the chiaroscuro distrib
uted to a nicety. Mr. Walcot was once
severely criticized by John Gllmer Speed
for overdoing his parts. . Mr. Speed's faith
would have been partly justified had he
been present last night, for many lines
that should, It seems to mo, have been
played -as comedy Mr. Walcot reduced to
farce.
Mr. Kindlay ' as the quarrelsome Dent
was forcible and effective, playing a good
foil to the equaHy good Custleton of
Earle Browne. Miss KUiston as Dorothy
looked so beautiful that, had Sir Joshua
been blessed with vision of her I am sure
he would have wished to paint his name
on the hem of her garment Instead of on
that of Mrs. Slddons. . .
"The Adventure of the Lady Ursula" Is
a plav that improves upon a second hear
ing. The fourth act." to be sure, is worth
less both as drama and as literature, and
the means of working up to the, central
situation -are artificial and threadbare,
i Butfrom the opening of. the second act
till the close of the third it Is possible to
forget these things, so terse and. polished
is ' the Â¦ dialogue. - so - subtle the . play % upon
each other of the two principal charac
ters. - / I- r>U PONT SYLE.

Vests Executive Council With
More Power.
MILWAUKEE. Aug. 1?.â The Interna
tional Typographical Union to-day voted
to meet next year at Birmingham, Ala.
The forenoon was taken up in discussing
a proposed amendment to the constitu
tion providing for a censorship by the
executive council of all communications of
union members to be printed in newspa
pers, circulars or pamphlets reflecting on
the standing or character, private or pub
lic, of any member or members of the
International Typographical Union. Mem
bers violating this clause will be subject
to trial, and fined, suspended or expelled
on a two-thirds vote of the members.
The object of the association is to con
trol in a measure much of the matter
printed in labor papers. The proposition
was adoptedâ 131 to 39.
The labor editors were given a hearing
and have promised to indorse the legis
lation.
Other matters acted upon to-day were
the indorsement of the Women's Labor
League and the adoption of legislation
prohibiting speed by hand or machine.
A resolution was passed empowering
the executive council to treat with a spe
cial committee of the American Publish
ers' Association for the purpose of cre
ating a general arbitration committee,
whose duty it will be to arbitrate all dif
ferences pending and future. It is said
the matter will be referred to all the
unions, and if fifty unions sustain the
ruling a referendum vote will then be
taken.

CENSORSHIP PLACED ON
EDITORS OF LABOR PAPERS
FITZ SAYS THAT HE MAY
CLAIM THE CHAMPIONSHIP
Issues a Defi to Jeffries,. Who Has
Refused to Meet Winner of
the Coming Fight.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 18.â Jeffries' refusal
to meet the winner of the Sharkey-Fltz
simmons light on August 31 has caused
the Australian to issue a statement In
which he threatens to claim the cham
pionship by default if successful in his
coming encounter. In this statement Fltz
simmons says:
'JJ see In this morning's papers that
Jeffries has crawled out of the possibility
of meeting me In the ring again. On
Tuesday Mr. Brady waited until Sharkey
and myself were matched for August 24,
\ Sr n ne challenged the winner to meet
JeffrlP3 August 31. I promptly acceptr J
the opportunity providing I was fortunate
enough to defeat Sharkey. The matter
was settled then and there. Now this
great champion of the world can't devote
ten days to training for the prospect of
establishing beyond question his right to
the title and earning about $2>,000.
The trutrr of the matter is that Jeffries
Is afraid to- meet me again. I hive ac
cepted every offer he ever made for a
return match and each time he has mado
some silly excuse to get out of the matcli.
I hereby give Jeffries notice that having
accepted his challenge in the event of
winning from Sharkey I shall claim the
championship of the world and I believe
the public will sustain my claim and
recognize me as the real champion "

official function. In his addres3 at hia

"I have sometimes been criticized for
going away from home instead of staying
here and having people come to see me.
but I have felt, in the flr*t place, that peo
ple could not come here as well as they
could go to Canton. Lincoln Is not in the
center of a thickly populated country, aa
Canton is. and our people have not the
means of traveling without cost as they
have In some parts of the country under
some circumstances, and I have felt that
it was a great deal cheaper for me to go

pel them to come and see me." (Ap

thing Chinese have no recourse to law
courts or written law. They are governed
by the rules of Confucius. It is this that
keeps the 500,000,000 people of China to
gether In a society. Do you wonder that
it Is hard to convert the Chinese?
"Now. taking up the matter of conces
sions. Here parties use missionaries to
get lands ana favors from the Chinese
Government. That this is true Is a mat
ter of history, and partly on this account
the Chinese masses have come to distrust
your bearers of Christianity. With the
matter of concessions the Chinaman's
worship of his ancestors is in undyiriK
conflict. As you worship your God so
the Chinese worships the tomb of his
father. They respect a dead friend as
much as you do a living one. Here is
the chief cause of the opposition to the
advent of railroads and mines, for these
must cut up the land where the bodies
lie.
"Some, people regard the Chinese as the
aggressors in the present trouble. We
all know that the Chinese are as a rule
not aggressive. They are willing to live
In -peace.
"This war. this trouble, may mean much*
for China and much for civilization. We
have no way of telling to what this trou
ble will lead. There is one danger: If
you teach the Chinese how to use modern
weapons, how to make machinery â teach
them your religion, force them into civili
zation, as you call it, they will learn
quickly. That may mean the triumph of
Kurope â and it raav mean othe-wlse.
Let me tell you that if the Chinese learn
your industries, they can supply the mar
kets of the world, and compete with the
world.
OAKLAND. Aug. '16.â Uo Tow. Chi
nese Consul General on the Pacific â¢
Coast, made his first public utter
ance on the present trouble in .
China to-night at the Ebell Society's
rooms. The Chinese Consul had been In
vited to address the society and he did so
to-night. Many gentlemen were present.
The reception room of the club was â¢
crowded with the exclusive set of Oak
land and many were turned away by lack .
of room.
The Consul appeared in native costume
of pale blue with light golden embroidery.
He spoke in English, saying:
"The three principal causes of the so
called war are: First, the unintentional
action of missionaries in China; second,
the acquisition of territory by foreigners;
third, the desecration of the homes and
graves of our ancestors.
"I want to say that the missionaries de
serve great credit for what they are do
ing, but there are a great many converts,
fo called, who use the missionaries as a
means to obtain their ends. Many China
men Join the missions because th#y have
committed crimes and want to get out of
the clutches of the Chinese officials. 1
remember a particular instance in Canton.
A Chinaman there had committed a
crime. Before it, had been found out he
went to a missionary society, accepted
the Christian religion, and when our Chi
nese policeman came after him he claimed
the protecton of the missionary's flag.
This caused some trouble between -the

HIS Broadway. 'Aug. 16.
J. G. Mattes Jr. of Centerville will prob
ably be the Republican nominee for the
Assembly in the Forty-sixth Assembly
District, and J. C. Crooks of Haywards,
who has been regarded as the only can
didate in the field, is entirely out of the
tace. Mattos is an attorney and one of
the prominent citizens of Washington
Township, and his candidacy has only
developed within the last few days.
Before the primaries J. C. Crooks, who
is a Deputy County Clerk, was an avowed
Ualton man and a candidate for the As
sembly. The Metcalf men advanced the
name of E. K. Strowbridge of liaywards
as opposed to him. but Mr. Strowbridge
was never very enthusiastic. William
McDonald of Livennore was not anxious
to return. He consented to allow his
name to remain in the iieid, but finally
pulled out. Crooks waa very anxious to
go to the Assembly and got Strowbridge
to withdraw. Knowing mat McDonalu s
entire was not strong. Crooks decided to
take his chances with an unpledged
ticket rather than to put a ticket of Ills
own In the tleld. He was permitted to
name the four delegates from liaywards
if he named two Dalton and two Metcalf
men. He chose K. Reid and 1'. Wilbert
as representing his side of the light and
H. K. Brurmer and K. K. Strowbridge as
from the other side.
J. G. Mattos Jr. announced his legisla
tive ambitions yesterday, anil from the
make-up of the convention it is not likely
that he will have much opposition. At any
rale Crooks is now compelled to admit his
defeat. The delt gates to this convention
are:
Dr \V H. Cope of Pleasanton: Archie
Agcr of Btmol; I'ltcr Oxson of IMeasanton;
Cal Holmes. F. Malley and Al Hall of
Livermore; A. D. S. Stoop cf Tesla;
Chester Young of Altamont; Charles
Evans of N"iU-.Â«; J. II. Wakoiield of Mis

A. Richmond of Alvarado; M. E. Mattos
of Irvington: H. K. iirunner. E. K. Strow
bridge, It. tfeid and P. Wilbert of Hay
ward*.
There is going to be a queer little fight
at Altr>mont at the coming county pri
mary. Jesse Young a::d Andrew Xicker
son of that place each want to attend the
Supervisorial convention, and so a special
election will be held for Altamont and the
two will be allowed to tight it out be
tween themselves. The result cannot in
any way affect the general result.
The indications are that C. P. Horner
of Centerville will be the Supervisorial
nominee in his district. Bailey of I^iver
more is out of it, and George F. Cash of
Irvington and C. V. Archibald of Center
ville belong to the defeated faction.
O Russ I^ukons opened headquarters to
day at the corner 1 of Twelfth street and
Broadway. He is said to be ready to put
money iii the fight to secure his nomi
nation for State Senator. His principal
opponent is AY. II. XVSLBtB of Berkeley.
The Congressional fight will cut Into this
fight to a great extent. Waste was a
M^tcalf man from the start and contrib
uted much to his success in Berkeley, and

Supervisor John Mitchell to-day issued
a statement paying that he had not with
drawn from the light for Supervisor, but
that he was Koing to make the fight and

The abandonment of the State series of
text books for the public schools Is the
scheme outlined in a letter received to
day- by County Superintendent of .Schools
T. O. Crawford from "W. C. Doub. Super
intendent of Kern County. This is >.nÂ» of
the most important matters which will bo
offered for the consideration of the Coun
ty School Superintendents of California
at their State biennial convention to be
held August 28, in San Jose.
The subject has aroused a great deal of
interest among educators of this State.
There has been a decided movement
among many oi the pedagogues antago
nistic to the State series of text bcok3.
and It has crystallized in the proportion
which has now been made public.
It is proposed by Superintendent Doub
that there shall be a uniform series of
text books used in the elementary schools
of the State, but that all text books shall
be selected, not written by contract, by
the State Board of Education. Further.
Superintendent Doub believes that "the
State shall not print the text books, but
the State Hoard of Education shall en
deavor to secure special rates for the
schools of California on all books se

It is propesed that the next Legisla
ture shall be invited to make such
changes in the school laws as will bring
about these proposed measures. Super
intendent Doub offers a recommendation
that the State Board of Education be com
posed of the State Superintendent of Puo
lic Instruction, the presidents of the uni
versity of California and of the Lcland
Stanford Jr. University, the head of the
department of education In each univer
sity and the presidents of the State Nor
mal schools provided these presidents are
elected by the other members of the State
Board. The question of a continuous gov
erning body, like the University of Cali
fornia regents, to control all the normal
schools will be considered. It Is also pro
posed that this new State Board of Edu
cation shall have wide powers in deter
mining the rank and relative standing of
schools out of the State for purposes of
issuing teachers' certificates. Many
changes in that system are outlined.
There is also a proposition to abolish,
the primary grade certificate.

Adolpn H. Bauerle is accused by his sis
ter U k " AnRle Sylva, of having threat
ened his mother on her dying bed to pub
lish to the world stories damaging to her
moral character unlesa she appeased hia
cupidity by granting him valuable prop
erty in East Oakland. The serious
charges of sister against brother are
made in a second suit brought to com
pel him to relinquish the land. It revives
the bitter fight instituted several month*
ago byi Mrs. Louisa Fromme, daughter
and an heir of the late Mrs. Louisa
Bauerle.
He is charged in the complaint filed to
day that Mrs. Bauerle. fearing her son"s
threats, deeded to him the property asked
for. The property in dispute consists of
fifteen acres of land in Brooklyn Town
f^Â¦ 1) , > c^ alue<1 at abou * *-' won - On January
11. 1K>9. a short time before the death of
Mrs Bauerle. she executed a deed of gift
for the realty to her son Adolph. When,
after her death, her will was filed for
probate an efTort was made by Mrs.
Louisa Fromme. a married daughter, to
have the gift deed revoked, but she w&s
unsuccessful. The case was dismissed
and the warring brother and sisters were
thought to have adjusted their differ
ences.
The complaint filed to-day by Mrs.
Sylva adds further complications to thÂ»
case by Including as defendants the origi
nal complainant Mrs. Louisa Fromme
and her husband. August Fromme, al
though they are not accused of having
any hand in the alleged fraud.
The specific charges against Adolph
Bauerle are that he took advantage of
hia mother's enfeebled condition and un
sound mind to frighten her into deeding
away her property.
The plaintiffs pray for the cancellation
of the deed and judgment that the dis
puted realty is a portion of the estate of
Louisa BauTle.

Better Investments Than Nome.
A great many of our citizens made in
vestments in Cape Nome which turned
out to be failures, but one of cur residents
invested only $1.00 In the Lottery of the
Beneficencla Publica Company of the City
of Mexico in the June 28th drawing, pur
chasing quarter ticket No. 74,514, which
drew the flrst capital prize of $50,000, his
share being $15,0w), which was promptly
paid to him.
Another fortunate investor of San Fran
cisco was K. J. McKeon, a gripman on
the JacUson-street cable, residing at
2SIR4 California street. who pur
chased quarter ticket No. 72,010 in the
May 24th drawing, which also won the
capital prize of S60.000, his chare being
116,000, which was also promptly paid.
This is the reason of the great popularity
of the Lottery of the Benencencla Publica
Coirpany, as many have won capital
prizes on this coast. Another reason is
that the public is aware that this is the
only lottery which has been guaranteed
and protected by the Mexican National
Government, which appoints Federal au
thorities to govern all drawings and pay
ment of prizes, therefore the fairness of
its drawings and the prompt payment of
prizes have always been vouched for by
the Department of State and everybody
assured of the honest dealings of the old
reliable Lottery of the Beneflcencia
Publica Company of the City of Mexico,
of which Mr. U. Bassettl is president and
manager.

On reaching the open air Jessen's
strength failed him, but willing hands
reached out, relieved him of his burden
and supported him to his home across the
street. The little crowd that gathered
around the burning building sent up cheer
after cheer as Jessen entered his home.
These peqnle say that 2S0 Iowa street,
"He Is there! I know he's there!"
screamed Mrs. Potting, "and If you don't
go and find him I wiil." She started for
the door, but Jessen lestrained her and
again entered the burning building. He
hurried to the lad's room and made for
the bed. As he was pulling aside the
coverlets In his search he stumbled over
the boy's foot. With all his latent
strength Jessen dragged the boy from be
neath the bed and with his unconscious
burden in his arms made his way slowly
downstairs. Another five seconds In thÂ«
room in which the la<i fell would have
meant death to both rescuer and res
cued.
Jessen sprang forward and, throwing
his weight against the front door, burst
it In. Making his way to the staircase
that led to the room occupied by the boy
he hurried up and Into the room. The
smoke was stifling and the boy was miss
ing. Drawing his coat over his face he
hurried from the building only to be told
that the child must have fallen In some
other room. Back Jessen rushed into the
smoke and flames. A second search was
fruitless and now, almost overcome, he
decided to abandon the search.
At 1 o'clock yesterday morning Bernard
Kane, who - is not vet 10 years of age,
was startled from his slumbers by a sharp
explosion. He sprang from his bed only
to find his room a seething mass of blaz
ing oil. Frenzied with fear the little fel
low groped for the door, but before he
reached It the smoke and heat dulled his
senses and he fell to the floor and rolled
back under the bed. This saved his life,
for in an instant the Interior of his home.
2S7 Iowa street, was enveloped In flames.
Neighbors hurried into the night to sound
an alarm and as they gathered near the
burning dwelling an aged lady, Mrs. F.
Potting, who lives in the rear of the Kane
home rushed from the house screaming
that little Bernard Kane was In the
building. With frenzied motions she
pointed to the windows of the room ne
occupied, out of which the flames were
already springing toward the eaves.
THAT the charred body of little Ber
nard Kane Is not lying on a slab in
the Morgue is due alone to the he
roism of George Harold Jessen, an
attache of the United States army medi
cal supply depot, GG5 Mission street.
where Jessen lives, will In the future be
the scene of a merry time, for they will
call and pay him fitting tribute for his
heroic deed.
Shortly after the boy was taken from
the building the fire department arrived
and soon extinguished the flames, but not
before his resting place na d been licked
bare by the flre.
While some remained to see Jessen safe
ly home others carried the still uncon
scious form of the lad he had rescued to
the home of Thomas Neeson. on Minne
sota street, two blocks away. Dr. Simp
son was summoned to care for the boy,
who had fortunately escaped the flamea,
the bedding protecting him until his res
cue. Many neighbors lent their aid and
all night they worked over the lad. and
not until long after daylight did he show
signs of returning consciousness. Toward
noon he had recovered sufficiently to tallc
about his startling experience.
The fire was caused by the explosion of
a coal oil lamp. It is believed by the fire
marshal. Save for Mrs. Potting, .who
lives in the, rear of the dwelling, the boy
was alone when the flames broke out. His
mother is now In the East and his father.
Dominlck Kane, was away from home.
The damage to the building -will amount
to several hundred dollars.
Mr. Jessen is very modest about the
heroic part he played In saving the lads
life. He only did that which he believed
to be the duty of every man, he said, and
if the occasion rose again he would risk
his life once more.
There was a small sized circus at the
Democratic meeting In Silk^s Hall on last
Wednesday night. President H. J. Stafford
did not appear, as it is supposed he ex
pected there would be a noisy meeting and
' ho did not desire to participate. In his ab
fence the vice president. William Byrne,
occupied the peat of honor, and had the
plecwure of hearing William Bell tell
Thomas Curran what he thought of him.
Curran, it must be remembered, is an as
uirnnt for Senatorial honors from the
Nineteenth Senatorial District. As a thorn
in his side, he suspects that Bell Is not
his friend. After that meeting Curran
will no longer have any misgivings on this
pubjÂ»ct. The meeting was delayed pend
ing: the arrival of Curran. who came in nt
9:30 o'clock ver> much affected by the in
fluence of the Bernal Heights foggy cli
mate. On his arrival he sought a side
show interview with Be!l. who. he said,
would lose his job in Golden Gate Park
unless Bell supported him In his tight
for a seat in the Senate. This made Bell
hot, and he lost no time in informing Cur
ran that he held his position in the park
through the good will of A. B. Spreckels.
nnd he (Curran) .or no other man could
oust him. This manly assertion on Bell's
part precipitated a small sized row, which
had the effect of breaking up the meeting
In good Kilkenny-cat style.
There Was Fun at Silk's Hall.
MARTIN KELLY and Phil
Crlmmlns, the Mint saloon
bosses, backed by Ilerrin of
the Southern Pacific, are
i treating the primary election
j cali of the Republican State Central Com
j mittee with derision, and attempting to
j constitute themselv.es the g-overning body
of the party and the autocrats of the
people.
Last night the Kelly and Crlmmlns
Congressional Committee of the Fourth
District adopted a cail for a convention
to nominate a Republican candidate for
Congress, and provided that the dele
gates to such convention should nominate
candidates for the Legislature in the sev
eral Assembly and Senatorial districts
embraced within the boundaries of the
Fourth Congressional District.
This was done in open contempt of the
official action of the State Central Com
mittee In directln" that delegates chosen
to the local convention In each county
should nominate the legislative candi
dates. It was done with the free knowl
edge that the Republican County Com
mittee of San Francisco, acting In line
with the suggestion of the State Central
i Committee, had called for a primary elec
tion to choose delegates to a local nomi
nating convention, and that the call for
that primary election clearly set. forth
that the delegates would nominate can
didates for the Legislature in the several
districts of San Francisco.
In open contempt and defiance of the
State Central Committee, the provision
holding that delegates for all the conven
j tions should be elected at one primary,
j Kelly and Crimmlns called for a primary
election to be held on a day apart from
that designated for the regular primary
of the Republican party.
An Unfair Scheme.
The scheme of apportionment adopted
by Keliy and Crimmlns last night is un
fair and in utter disregard of the rights
' of the people. It arbitrarily gives five
delegates to each Assembly district, with
out regard to the population of the dis
trict or to the number <Ak Republican
votes cast therein at the^fcist election.
The people are deprived dm just repre
sentation, inasmuch as a district casting
2000 Republfcan votes gets no larger rep
resentation in the nominating convention
than a district polling lOou Republican
votes.
The fair and equitable plans of appor
tionment adopted by the State Central
Committee and the county committee are
thrown aside in order to give the bosses
opportunity to perpetuate the power of
bossism.
The whole plan put forward by, Kelly,
Crlmmins and Herrin is so rank and revo
lutionary that the suspicion arises that
the Mint saloon bosses have engaged in
another conspiracy to betray the Repub
lican party in the interests of the Demo
crats.
Driven to anger and desperation over
the victory recently achieved in the Re
publican County Committee by the advo
cates of clean politics, the bosses have
adopted a plan to cheat the people and de
moralize the party. On the day that the
Republican State Central Committee met
at Golden Gate Hall to adopt a revised
call for a State convention Kelly and
Crimmlns ordered a meeting of the
Fourth Congressional District Committee,
At the meeting held then and there Kelly
moved that a committee, consisting of P.
A. Prendergast. A. Barnard and P. A.
Kearney, be appointed to prepare a call
for a Congressional District Convention.
The committee reported last night to a
meeting which was composed of .Joseph S.
Spear Jr.. P. H. Prendergast. James
Snook, A. Ruef, J. A. Hoey. W. T. Howe,
Xo Lieutenant Governor of New York
has served more than two terms since the
adoption of the present constitution In
1S46.
M. F. Taylor will speak at a Democratic
rally at Metropolitan Temple next Tues
day night. This will mark the opening of

The Brian and Stevenson Club of the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District met at
Saratoga Hall last nipht and indorsed the
Democratic ticket. Among the speakers
were J. C. Quinlan. Eugene M. Deuprey
and R. P. Troy. There was a good at
tendance.
nÂ«*?far5' to enumerate.
The foregoing :,*-.Â¦ arc sufficient to indicate :
that tin- primary election cannot be held or Its !
result Droperly ascertained or declared In the j
presort status nf affairs.
In the haste of adjournment of our lart '
ir.oetinK. and owing to the unnecessary length of !
the ro-poiution adopted â or prrhap* of exjirrss i
purpose â the committee omitted to provide for ;
the number or manner of ar'iÂ«?ir.tmfr.t of this '
imp'Ttar.t sul-CTrcrnittee.
Were it not for the fact that under our by- j
laws another meeting ce;:H not be called be- i
fore ne?:t Saturday evening, and that thf> time j
thence intervrr.inff to the dale of the primary i
rhwrton aronUI be Bfcaokitely too short to Ji th? '
nectfgpary work of the committee. I thould ?=uk- '
pest that a special meeting of the entire Court? ;
Committee be called to take action in the J
i> remises.
In view, however, of the Impracticability of
:his suggestion and of the urgent necessity cf
having such a committee at work imnjediAtelv,
I respectfully request that under article III
â¢ page 4) of the by-laws you forthwith appoint
the committee provided fnr by Faid call and
Deeeasary to ecrry out th* requirements nf said
call and the details of sild primary election.
And if not too rrepuir-iituou? on my part. I
V>eg to suggest that the committee to be ep

one from, each Assembly district.

IN order to carry out the plan of pri
mary election adopted by the Repub
lican County Committee last Saturday
night the chairman, Alfred Bouvler,
will appoint a committee to provide a
uniform system of making returns. The
jH'cÂ«".''Fity for immediate action upon the
I'art of the chairman Is pet -forth In the
following communication: -â¢-*Â¦â
SAX FRAN'flSOO, August 15. 1900.
Mr. A. Bouvter. chairman Republican County
Committee of San Franciscoâ I x>ar Sir: I bejr
;,:.:Â¦: to call vcur particular attention to the
itmeniied call for a convention and ' primary
election,- adojted at the last meeting of the
Cotmtjr OqjnmlttM.
The original scheme having been changed by
amendment, eo that the delegation in the Coun
ty Committee for each Assembly district shall
tave full control, and the remainder of the
Resolution remaining unchanged, leaves unpro
vided for several matters of the greatest im
portance.
The call, ae now constituted, veets control of
the election In the r*>*i*ective Assembly dis
trict?, m the County Con-.mitteemen of the dis
trict, but also provides for a committee (num
ber and manner of epr>olntroent not specified).
Â»-ith important duties and functions Â¦which can
in no was' be performed by the district com
niitteemrn, and without which, substantially,
the entire plan of the primary flection and the
1 rimary election itself mupt fail.
<-ther matters intrusted to such com
mittee bjr said plan are the following:
1. Procuring and rxovldlne ballot-boxes and
r^cfssary rflrsphernalia for the various election
booths.
2. Publishing the location of polling places
end thÂ«Â» call tor primary election.
3. Eecatiag and supplying- maps and registers
as per call.
4. .Irpuing credentials to representatives of
fjiposing pets of candidates.
5. Formulating and isyuir.g general rules and
regulations applicable to all districts to secure
uniformity of procedure and Jairness of pro
ceedings.
(: Formulating rules and regulations for tally- j
!r.g, canvat.-ing and returning the votes of each
polling j^aee.
7. 1'rovidirg the necessary protection to all
I*-llinÂ«r places and attending to other details, so i
that the j revision nt the call concerning pe.i- j
dllng of ticket.", toli'-iting of votes, etc., shaii be '
properly carried out.
?. The providing of general supervision of the j
jirimery election, the settlement of contests and ,
Â«>f grievances, the decision of questions of al- i
Jfged Irau.l. :
6. The remedying of any deficiencies or dlffi- 1
culties In ar.v district en the day of the pri- j
mary election.
10. Thi- reception and printing of all tickets to
be used nt xy-.e primary election, as required by i
aid call.
11. The recpirt of the election returns from j
the diFtri'MF and the canvassing and certifying !
thereof.
::. Many other incidental yet necessary de- i
tai's anl matters vhieh must occur to any on<;
roadinsr the i)!sn. and which I deem it un-
The call was then adopted. If further
amendments can be inserted to deprive
voters of their remaining rights the com
mittee will find a way to devise the plans.
That the call be adopted as read and that a
committee of four, consisting of P. H. Pren
dergast. Dr. P. A. Kearney, K. Barnard and A.
Iluef, be appointed as such with power to
amend the call as in their Judgment may seem
proper.
On motion of Dr. P. A. Kearney, sec
onded by J. A. Hoey*. the motion to adopt
the call was amended to read as follows:
A. Ruef directed the attention of the
members to the fact that the County Com
mittee, acting In harmony with Instruc
tions from the State governing body, had
provided for a convention to nominate
legislative candidates.
The section relating to the nomination
of Senators and Assemblymen provoked
some discussion. Advocates of the scheme
insisted that authority for the departure
was derived from the Republican Nation
al Committee.
Resolved, That the delegates from each of
the Assembly districts within the Fourth Con
gressional District at said primary election
shall be and they are hereby empowered and
authorized to meet In said Congressional Dis
trict convention and in said Assembly District
and Senatorial District conventions and nom
inate any and all candidates for public office
that are to be voted for by the qualified voters
of the district at the next general election for
which the nominations are made.
That the boards of election at each polling
place at the closing of the polls must canvass
the vote and inclose the returns together with
the ballots In an envelope furnished for that
purpose by the secretary of this committee to
the chairman or secretary of the Fourth Con
gressional District Committee, who will an
nounce the result and Issue credentials to the
delegates elected at said primary election.
Retolved, That for said primary election only
the printed precinct register used at the last
city election held in 1899 is to be used.
That said primary election should be held on
Saturday, August 25, 1900, between the hours of
10 a. m. and 3 o'clock p. m.
That the test to voters shall be, "Do you In
tend to vote for the Republican nominee for
Congress at the next general election?"
That the voting shall be by ballot and each
voter's name must appear on the precinct reg
ister as used within each district at the last
flection held within each district for the elec
tion of city officers.
â¢ That the apportionment of delegates to be
elected from each Assembly district to said
Congressional District Convention shall be five
delegates to each Assembly district.
That there should be one polling place in each
Assembly district in said Fourth Congressional
District and a board of election for said polling
place shall be one inspector, two judges and
one clerk, who shall be appointed by this com
mittee.
Therefore, be It
Resolved, That a primary election be and is
hereby called by the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict Republican Committee of the Republican
party of the United States and of the State of
California for the purpose of electing delegates
to a Congressional District Convention from, the
several Assembly districts comprising said Con
gressional district.
Call for a Primary.
P. A. Kearney. H. Byrne, J. H. Nelson
and Jacob Levi Jr.
The Bosses' DÂ«flance.
The following call was presented and
adopted:
The Fourth Congressional District Republican
Committee of the Republican party of the
United States and the State of California, for
the Fourth Congressional District of said State,
in meeting assembled in the city and county of
San Francisco, and In the Fourth Congres
sional District, State of California, on this
16th day of August. 1900, hereby adopts this
call for a Republican Conzressional District
Convention to be held on the 1st day of Septem
ber, 19C0, at-S o'clock p. m., in the city and
county of Sn.n Francisco.
That said convention shall consist of one hun
dred and fifty-live (155) delegates and all of said
delegates must be elected at a primary elec
tion at which all Republicans shall have an
opportunity to vote, to be held in each of the
Assembly districts comprising the Fourth Con
gressional District.
That the apportionment of delegates to said
Congressional District Convention shalt be five
delegates to each Assembly district within the
Fourth Congressional District and -which Is as
follows:
Dist. ; Xo. of Del. Dist. No. of Del.
Twenty-eighth 5 Forty-second 5
Twenty-ninth 5 Forty-third 5
Thirtieth 5 Forty-fourth 6
Thirty-first 5 Forty-fifth 5
Thirty-second C ' â
Thirty-third 5 Total 55
Thirty-ninth 5
That said delegates shall be elected at a pri
mary election by ballot and be an organized
assemblage of delegates representing the Re
publican party of the United States and of the
Fourth Congressional District of the State of
California and every Assembly district com
prising said Fourth Congressional District.
That a convention shall be held in every As
sembly district and every ! Senatorial district
within said Fourth Congressional District.
That said Fourth Congressional District Con
vention shall nominate a member of the Repub
lican party as a candidate for member of Con
gress for the Fourth Congressional District of
the State of California, to be voted for by the
voters of the district at the next general elec
tion, to be held on Tuesday. November 6. 1900.
That said Assembly District and Senatorial
District Convention shall each nominate a can
didate for member of the Assembly and mem
ber of the State Senate, to be voted for by the
voters of the several Assembly and Senatorial I
districts for which the nominations are made.
Republican voters throughout the city
arc d'.mandins that measures shall be
adopted to secure an honest election In
every voting precinct. Every Republican
voter Is entitled to vote once a,nd to have
his. vote honestly tallied. A resolute re
turning board, composed of men of lnte<
lipiTcc and integrity can exercise a good
influence. When Republican citizens are
assured that ballot-box stuffing, repeat
ing and the voting of absentees will not
be countenanced the Invitation to par
ticipate In the election of delegates to
the nominating conventions Mill not be
treated with derision. It Is in the power
of the County Committee to give to the
voters assurance of an absolutely fair
primary.
The articles governing the committee
c!ear)y give to the chairman the right of
action 1m the premises, but ae he does
not desire to act on his own responsibil
ity he consults a large number of com
mitteemen ami the majority of the com
mittee recommend the appointment of a
canvassing board. It is understood that
a committee of eighteenâ one from eacn
Assembly districtâ will be announced 10
dav.
