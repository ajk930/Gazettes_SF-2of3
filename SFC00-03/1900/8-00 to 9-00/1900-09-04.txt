THE horse transport Federica was
late in getting away last night. Uncle
Sam wants horses In the Philippines
as woll as in China, and he also
wants artillerymen.
Horses are good in their way, but mules
come, In for a great amount of praise,
more particularly when it comes to run
ning an ammunition wagon over rough
country. In consequence the Fcdorica took
away yesterday nearly as many of tho.
long-eared variety as those of longer
tails. When thÂ»- transport Wt the wharf
there were aboard 2.">f) horses. 168 mules
and thirty-five enlisted men. The Feder
ica is to go to Manila via Honolulu, but,
like the Rosecrans, she may be sidetracked
to Taku. * . . .
Of tho thirty-fivo enlisted men on the
Federica eighteen are from Battery C and
fifteen irom Battery M. Seventh Artillery.
The Federica is fitted up in splendid
shape for tho transportation of horses.
Her lower and amidship docks have been
fixed up In such a manner as to 1 prevent
the waste and dangers that always come
i'P when a typhoon Is encountered. The
animals are kopt in as small a space as
possible and tho attendants are given
every chance to care for them properly.
On the Federica another occurrence of the
Siam disaster would be Impossible, as the
Federica is so fitted as to prevent the
horses from falling and Injuring them
selves in a heavy sea.
There was no. difficulty in getting the
animals aboard the transport yesterday.
The gangway was not as steep as some
of the stairways the horses have to climb
in San Francisco livory stables, and In
consequence the horses and mules walked
aboard and down the inclined stairways
to their stalls as though they were ashore.
FEDERICA CARRIES BIG
CARGO OF HORSES.
INHERE was more trouble attending
I the sailing of the transport Rose
[ crans yesterday than there would be
In the biggest barrel of monkeys that
ever came to San FranclPco.
The vessel was late in sailing and quite
a number of the soldiers made their es
cape over the walls and got drunk.
The officers who went after them took
many a drink during the hunt, and In
consequence when.it came near sailing
time both officers and men were well "un
der the weather."
In spite cf tho varied attractions of La
l>or day in the city, large crowds were
down watching the departure and enjoy
ing the chase for derelict doughboys.
They were all got aboard at last, after
s;s exciting an afternoon n-S was ever wit
nessed Â«jn Bast s-treet.
Such a riotous time was never before
feen on the water front. Drunks were
beaten into Insensibility; and tho men who
os'-aped with "lacerated wounds of the
scalp" were lucky. Tim police could not
interfere, as a corporal's guard was in full
control. Nevertheless in the ease of some
of the firemen the poFse in control nt the
gate had to Interfere, and in consequence
a number of the Kose.brans' coal-passÂ«?rs
were locked up and new men took their
places on the transport.
Those who wont away on the Rosecrans
wore six officers of Light Batteries C and
M Seventh Artillery, two officers unat
tached, ten acting assistant surgeons. 145
men of Battery C. 14ii men of Battery M,
T'fi recruits. 114 hospital corps and three
signal corps. Tho transport goes from

impression is that she .will go direct to
Manila from JaTian. but some of those in

TRANSPORT ROSECRANS
SAILS FOR CHINA.
GERMAN GOVERNMENT IS
LOADING THE SAMOA.
UNCLE SAM is not the only one who
Is rushing; men. horses and sup
plies to the Far East. The Ger
man Government wants fodder and
horses and after searching the world over
the Kaiser comes to California for nis
supplies. Russia wants provisions. Eng
land and France want our wheat and now
Germany, that balked at the Chicago ho?:
and American canned meats, is knocking
at the door of California and asking for
horses and fodder.
Within the last forty-eight hours' the
British ship Samoa. 4507 tons net burden,
and the German garner Nurnbcrg, 4150
tons net burden, have arrived from for
eign ports. Both are under charter to ths'
German Government to load fodder und
horses for use of the German army in
China. Â¦ \
The Samoa will dock at Lombard-street
wharf to-day and will at once be fitted
out to carry 750 horses and 5000 tons of
general merchandise to Kiaochau. On th*
opposite side of Lombard street to that
on which the Samoa will be placed the
Nurnberg will dock. She will take away
about 700 horses and irules and- over 4000
tons of fodder. The Nurnberg was from
Kobe. Japan, and an the bubonic plague
was raging there when the steamer left
she was quarantined on arrival here;
The Samoa and Nurrberg will probably
dock to-day and then the work of get
ting them ready for a trip to China will
begin at once. The chances are that it'
both dock at Lombard street it will be
one of the busiest docks on the front for
some time to come. It will be a curious
spectacle â Uncle Sam rushi.ig matters at
Folsom street. Germany hurrying supplies
away from Lombard street and Russia
loading general merchandise at Steuart
street.
ANOTHER BIG LOG RAFT
REACHES PORT.
*
CoTP NOTHER log raft reached port yes
//\\ terday. It is 61S feet lone and
Ji draws twenty-eight feet of water.
** contains over 7,000.000 feet of lum
ber and its advent makes the lumber
dealers say anathema and maranatha.
The raft was towed from West Seattle
by the tugs Tatoosh and Rescue and its
safe arrival means that at least forty
ordinary coasting vessels have been done
out of a load. Forty ordinary coaster?
would mean at least the employment of
200 sailors, masters and men and. of
course, every one of these are more than
indignant at the success of the raft-tow
ing proposition.
lhat the towins of these rafts la a men
ace to navigation even the captains of
the tups wfl! not dispute, but neverthe
less. s--o loner as moneyâ and big- money at
thatâ can he made out of it the raftmer
will take the chances and those that ro
clown to the Fea in ships will also take
their chances. When the last raft came
in it was guiltless of a lipht or the sem
blance of a place on which to hang one.
Tho Call pointed out that both tugs were
liable to seizure for this infraction of the
law. When tho last raft came to an an
chorapre off MeigRS wharf yesterday it
was ornamented by a brandnew tripod
and a new lantern thaj had never seen
palt water before.
Tho trip down thr coast of the Tatoosh
and Rescue and their tow was an un
eventful one. Oft the roast of Mendocino
a storm was run into and both tups am!

The seas were very heavy, but the tus?
took refutre under the lee of the raft antl
so rode out the storm. From Cape Men
docino it was a long- pull and a strong
pull. The raft will be broken up in Mis

LONDON, Sept. 4. 4:10 a. m. â The latest^ reliable Peking
date is how nearly a fortnight old. An undated dispatch
has been received at Vienna reporting that the allied
roops marched through the Imperial palace August 28. but it
vas known that this date had been fixed by the allied comnand
â¢_rs for a formal promenade. There is no other news of-any kind.
The Hongkong correspondent of the Daily Mail says that
:he Canton officials have been ordered to transmit all possible
revenue to the north for Avar expenses, and that all pay of offi
rials, from the Viceroys down, has been stopped during hos
tilities.
The Vienna correspondent of the Standard telegraphs that

Italians \vill remain in Peking after the Russians withdraw.
Shanghai and Hongkong dispatches express the utmost as
tonishment at the idea of evacuating Peking.
The Daily News suggests editorially that Russia may have
made secret terms with China behind the backs of the powers.
The Standard expresses gratification at the explanation the
United States Government does not approve of Russia's pro
ceedings.
lie Daily Express publishes an interview with a New York
laman. Liu Chuah. now staying in London, who admits Li
ng Chang's "duplicity and rooted antagonism to western
ideas/' but thinks that the allies have no choice but to negotiate
with him or to retire from China altogether. (
M. de Blowitz, the Paris correspondent of the Times, as
lat the origin of Russia's decision to evacuate Peking
ivas her desire to frustrate the schemes of Emperor William and
to correct the impression produced by the Kaiser's speech at
ing to Emperor Nicholas the initiative in the appointment
of Field Marshal Count von Waldcrsee to the command of the
international troops. *
'â¢Russia also desired." says M. de Blowitz. "to save France
from the hard necessity of placing her troops under Count von
rsee. The United States was also much dissatisfied at
Â¦Â¦ ?pect of its troops acting under German orders.
If you compare the Russian evacuation proposal with the
can plan for beginning negotiations before Count von
Waldersee's arrival, and if you add to this the prompt adherence
f France, addressed to the United States, you have the com
plete key to the Russo-American mystery."

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 3.â "I have not a
single clew to the murderers," said Sheriff
Johnson at 9:30 o'clock to-night, telephon
ing from Folsom to The Call correspond
ent.
"I have Just come In from an ail day's
hunt for clews in the case, with Deputy
Sheriff Hinters oT my ot!ice and Constabla
James Donnelly." continued tho Sheriff.
"I don't know what to think of the caso.
It was elth'-r the work of some crank or
some man with vthom the victims, Wil
liam Taylor and Hans Kasmuasen, had
had a quarrel. Kasmui^en was last seen
alive about last Wednesday, and Taylor
last Thursday. Both men, I have learned,
â¢were given to the use of liquor. The lock
on the Rate in the road leading directly
from the Carpenter house, tho scene of
the Rasmussen murder, to the Perazzo
house, the scene of the Taylor murder,
was broken. That is a circumstanco of
some, importance as showing the road
I taken by the murderer. 1 am inclined to
believe that the murders were eommitted
by somebody familiar with the country
and the' premises. No wandering tramj>
did it. But. as 1 said, I am wholly with
out a clew. "
The Facts in the Tragedies.
Such is the discouraging report made by
Sheriff Johnson and one of his cleverest
deputies after a hard day's work on the
ground. investiBatinff as to the motive
and perpetrators of the murder of Huns
Raamumn and William Taylor, near
Folsom. described in special dispatches to
The Call. Both bod'ea were found Sun
day morning and they lay In each in
stance In the kitchen. Rasmussen in the
house of William Carpenter, and Taylor
In the house of Joseph Pcraizo. The
houses are nearly two miles apart In a
desolate and unfrequented part of thw
county, two or three mik.s southeast <>f
Folsom. Carpenter and Ferazzo ar*> both
Â¦well-to-do sheep owners. They are -with
their flocks on the mountain ranpea tifty
miles away. They placed the murdered
men on their respective places aa care
takers during their absence. When the
offlcÂ«rs went to the scene of the murders
they found the houses locked at every
doer. Only one means of access was
visible at each house, a half-open window.
In each instance the body had been life
less for several days. In nrither instance
had robbery been commit tetl. either as to
the house or the person of the slain. In
neither Instance was there tho slightest
evidence of a struffjrle.
Savage Are the Murders.
Tet the murders were most savase.
Each body contained several bullets. The
Indications were that after ' the victims
had fallen the murdorer or murderers
fired into the prostrate form. Strangely
enough, tho keys of the fast-locked door
could not be found. Kither the murderer
had escaped by tho half -open window
through which ho entered, or had closed
the kitchen door after him, locked it
with the key taken from the body, and
taken tho kev with him on his flight. But
tho amazing feature of the caso Is that
the murderer should have done almost the
same thing at both houses, and should
have found both his victims fully dressed
and unprepared for resistance, and In the
same portion of hou?os that He nearly two
miles from each other.
These are tho facts on which the offi
cers are working. Another coincidence is
referred to bv all the officers connected
with the case as tho most remarkable ever
encountered in tho whole racgo of thefr
experience.
Folsom is In a turmnil over the murders.
Farmers living In places equally as Iso
lated as those where the murders occurred
are struck by the uncanny features of thÂ«
caso and ar<? torturing themselves with
the dread that some maniacal murderer
is abroad and bent on accomplishing h!s
fearful crimes in a fantastic fashion.
Theories in the Tragedies.
In Sacramento the murders form an ab
sorbing topic. The fact, first stated herÂ©
to-day by District Attorney Baker, that
the gate on tho road leading from one
lanch house to the other had boon forced
open 'Is accepted as showing that tho
murderer traveled on horseback or in a
wagon, as a ir.nn on fooc would more like
ly have scaled the intercepting fence.
But thl* circumstance, like all others thiM
far brought to the attention of the offi
cers, relates to the method of tho murders
rather than to the motive.
As to the latter there is a world of spec
ulation. Tho first theory that it was th<Â»
caprice of a* madman has been quite gen
erally abandoned. Instead. Â¦ tho belief In

WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.â A dispatch from Minister Conger was received
by the State Department to-day. It was chiefly interesting in being
the first word from him since his dispatch of the 27th referring to the
nronostd parade of troops through the Â«mperial- palace in Peking.
Like that dispatch, this Is dateless as to Peking. The contents were

- â Â«* EXVER, Colo.. Sept. 3.â Major S. K. Hooper of this city has received a
1 letter from Lieutenant Colonel C. A. Coolidge. dated Tientsin. China.
I August 8. Lieutenant Colonel Coolidge led the Ninth Infantry in Its at-
J tack on the inner walla of Tientsin. The letter gives an account of the
- â * fig-hting at Tientsin, and continues:' â¢"
"The Japanese looted the Chinese bouses, but the French were 'entirely in
the robbery business and robbed and murdered right and left. I believe the
British were granted one day to loot, but this was soon stopped, except by the
French, who still continued the work In their own quarter. * The American
quarter has been very quiet and we guard it as best we can with our small
garrison. The Chinese dead are all buried and the town Is cleared up and peace
"There were 20,000 dead Chinese and probably' one-third of* the city is burned
by shot and shellor incendiaries. On account of the crowded condition of the
city it would be a good thing if one-half of it were destroyed."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.â While 'Americans have not participated In the loot'
Ing of Tientsin and Peking, well-informed diplomats here think the people of
China will hold them partly ' responsible for Injuries suffered and losses sus
tained. i ' 'â¢*'*-Â¦ 4 j-' '
"The Americans," said one diplomat to-day, "should feel proud of their ab
stinence, but they form part of an allied army which is causing the Chinese so
much suffering. The Chinese do not know that they are being plundered by the
Russians particularly or by the French or English. They see the American
flag in the army and they naturally credit those under that flag with as great
a share in the looting as they do the troops of other nations."
Russians do not believe the Czar's troops have been guilty of the excesses
reported. in the dispatch from Taku published to-day, and say that if any crimes
have been committed an investigation will undoubtedly be made and those respon
sible will be punished. Attention was called to-day to the sensational stories of
Russian atrocities credited to the wife of E. B. Drew, chief secretary of Sir
Robert Haft at Tientsin, and afterward declared by Mrs. Drew to bejtalse. "I
can from my own experience during those terrible days of the siege of Tter.tsin."
she said, "speak only in the highest terms* of the Russian soldiers, who undoubt
edly saved our lives on more than one occasion." - : ='-'Z,
The War Department professes to have no confirmation of the reports of loot
ing by the allies, but it i3 stated that even if it had any information it would
be suppressed.

32, is also a married man, and has four
children. His wife Is attractive, as the
Constable discerned, and he paid much
attention to the pretty Mrs. Sutton, it is
said.
This state of affairs aroused the jeal
ousy of Sutton, and he determined to put
an end to the companionship of the two.
With this purpose in view he went to
Clasby about a week ago and told him
that his attentions to Mra. Sutton must
cease. Whether he had evidence to war
rant the assertion or not, Sutton finally
charged qiasby with alienating the affec
tions of his wife and wrecking his home.
Clasby, at that, retorted angrily. Fierce
invective followed and Sutton drew a pis
tol. But the encounter that might have
ended then in a tragedy was brought to
an end through the Intercession of friends.
But, despite the temporary truce, it was
feared that the strained relations between
them could have but one result, and the
fears were realized Saturday.
From the evidence adduced at the Coro
ner's inquest, it appears that Sutton,
brooding long over his troubles, finally
detet^iined to kill the man who had des
poiled his home and sullied his honor.
With that end in view, he armed himself
on Saturday and %vent to the Postofflce.
where he knew he would surely find
Clasby at some time during the afternoon.
It was 1:45 p. m. when the Constable, who
had gone to the Postofflce, emerged from
the door.
Just as he crcssed the threshold he be
held Sutton with a drawn revolver. The
spectators, paralyzed by astonishment
and fear, heard Sutton shout:
"Clasby, you're a dead man!"
At the same instant he fired. Clasby
reeled and fell dead. The aim had been
deadlyâ the bullet sped true to Its mark.
When the autopsy was held the physi
cians found that the bullet, entering cias
by's left side, had pierced the center of
his heart.
Sutton made no attempt at resistance
when placed under arrest, but went Quiet
ly with the officer, who took him to the
Colusa Jail. The body of Constable Clasby
was removed to his home, where the
autopsy was held.
The same evening the Coroner sum
moned a jury that, after hearing the evi
dence In the case, returned a verdict In ac
cordance with the facts. The Coroner,
thereupon, sent Sutton to jail to be held
for trial without bonds.
INDIAN IS SLAIN
BY TWO COMRADES
Rumor of Murder in Bear Valley, San

Sheriff Has No Official
Knowledge.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Sept. 3.â News reached
this city to-day of a possible murder com
mitted in Bear Valley, in the northern
part of the county, in which an Indian
was the victim. His body was found
with the skull crushed, near where he
had been seen the day before in com
pany with two other Indians.
The report is that the body was found
on the road near the James Brutisdon
place, which Is now occupied by a ranch
er named Risdon. The side of. the head
was crushed in and the brains protruded
but there was no blood about the place
nor were there any signs of a struggle
This has led to the theory that the man"
was killed somewhere else by the two
men. with whom he was seen drinking the
previous evening, and that his body was
brought to the place where it was found
The body v/as found early last week"
according to the report, but neither the
Coroner nor Sheriff had been notified
There is little communication with the
valley, and the report could not be au

BUTTE, Mont.. Sept. 3.â When The Dev

afternoon tho Butte poolrooms found
themselves loser $^0,000. It was a "killing"
pure and simple. The tip came from Chi
cago parly in the day, and from the open

down to S and 'J to 1. with the prospect ot
being out had any more money appeared.

CHICAGO, Sept. ::.â The Montana crowa

Harlem to-day, and when The Devil was
announced winner of the seventh race the
hooks were called upon tTo pay out be
tween $20,000 and $30,000 to lucky ticket
holders.
Eddie Aiistln was the heaviest loser and
.when he finished paying off and stepped
from the block he admitted that the race
had hit him for $SO0O. Every one of the
twenty books suffered more or less, tho
smallest loser being Joe Rope, the Cali
forninn, who admits a loss of $500.
The Devil was a rank outsider and,
based upon his run at Hawthorne recent

him. where he ran fourth, was rated at

Woodward, The De%-il's owner, has little

HAS NOT REPLIED
TO RUSSIAN NOTE
PARTS, Sept. 3.â France has not yet re
plied to Russia's note regarding the with
drawal of troops from Poking. M. Del
casse. Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
the Russian Embassador. Prince Orous
sow, went to Rambouillet to-day to confer
upon President Loubet the decoration of
the Russian order of St. Andrew, recent
ly accorded him by the Czar and to pre
sent to M. Loubet the autograph letter
accompanying the decoration. It is be
lieved this will give opportunity for arÂ»
exchange of views which will have an ef
fect upon the ministerial meeting which
will be held here to-morrow.
"When handing to M. Loubet the Order
of St. Andrew the Russian Embassador
said: "His Majesty desires you to see>
in this act, M. le President, a proof of
the high esteem he entertains for you
and a token of his unchanging sentiments
for the growth of this friendly and al
lied nation."
M. I.roubet replied as follows: "His Ma
jesty has wished to testify once again to
the persistence of his feelings toward this
friendly and allied nation and we. In turn,
see In this action a proof of his. Majesty's
wish to draw still closer the ties which
unite the two governments and peoples.
I beg you to transmit to his Majesty my
gratitude and to assure him that the
French Government Is striving every day
to maintain this union, so profitable to
the two nations."
M. Loubet, after the presentation, en
tertained the Russian Embassador at
dinner. A torchlight procession followed,
the streets being gayly oecorated with the
intertwined flags of France and Russia.
The following is the text of the auto
graph letter from Emperor Nicholas to
M. Loubet, which accompanied the In
signia of the order:
"My feelings toward you and the bonds
of cordi'al friendship which unite France
and Russia inspired me with a desire to
admit you to my imperial order of St.
Andfew, the insignia of which will be
handed you at the same time as this let
ter. It is particularly gratifying to me
to offer you this testimony of esteem at a
time when a complete understanding, so
happily established between France and
Russia, can more than ever exercise a
beneficial Influence not only upon their
direct interests, but i^Iso upon the mainte
nance of the general peace which Is
equally our heart's desire. With real In
terest I have followed the success of the
splendid exposition upon which France
has a right to pride, herself and I have
no need to assure you of the very sincere
regard I feel, as well as that of the Em
press, that we are unable'to visit Paris
at this time. But, whether far or near,
we are accustomed to associate ourselves
with everything that concerns France:
and it Is with all the preater satisfaction
that we welcome what contributes to her
glory and prosperity."
France regards peace as the first requi
site of the situation, but is not entirely
certain that the withdrawal of the troops
from Peking is the surest and quickest
method to attain this end. ' ' %

But why quote from newspapers as to what

tyrannical as was ever asserted or exercised

of these perils the laboring man has a responsi

The warning Is even more needed now than
It was forty years ago. The Army and Navy
Jcurnal is already Justifying the colonial Idea
and declaring that fate has decreed for us a
destiny in which an imperial executive free
from restraints of a written constitution will
govern subjects according to his own pleasure
The United States Investors' Review published
at r.oston, in Its issue of July 2S, says- "Only
a blind person can fall to see that transforma
tions of one kind or another are in store for
our race: hence the folly of asserting that the
policy of this country, which Is destined trt
play such a leading part in human affairs of
the future, shall be governed for the most part
by political axioms uttered more than a hun
dred years ago. The greatest evil which now
confronts this republic is the clamor raised by
n certain faction for a settlement of our prob
lems of state by just such a method as we
have been deprecating. Considerably more than
a century ago a certain notable declaration
v,as made in this country to the effect that all
men oueht to he free and independent "
Tills is merely a generalization of the French
school of Voltaire and the encyclopedists It
Is a dictum absolutely lacking foundation in
history and fcicapable of syllogistic Justifica
tion. It was, however, a handy phrase for us
to employ when asserting, our right to break
away from the mother country: it suited the
exigencies of our situation in 1776 admirably
though In Itself but a bit of sublimated demal
goglsm. The declaration was a serviceable
means to the end that was at that time desired
To bring forward this declaration in this year
1W) In connection with our treatment of the
Filipinos and the Cubans is as gross an ab
surdity as ever was practiced. To do so is
to offer an Insult to the intelligence of the
people who first subscribed to the declaration
in question.
Warning Needed Now.
When I say that those who distrust the
capacity of the people for self-government tend
directly toward monarchy. I am only repeat-.
Ing what Lincoln deliberately declared in his
first annual message: He said: "Monarchy it
self is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge
from the power of the people. In my present
position I could scarcely be Justified were I to
omit raising a warning voice ngainst the ap
proach of returning despotism. It Is not needed
nor fitting here that a general argument should
be made in favor of popular institutions; but
there in one point with its connections not fo
hackneyed as most others, to which I ask
brief attention. It is the effort to place cap
ital on an equal footing with. If not above
labor, in the structure of government. No
men living are more worthy to be trusted than
those who toil up from poverty: none les* in
clined to take or touch aught which they have
not honestly earned. Let them beware of sur
rendering a political power which they already
possess and which, If surrendered will sure
ly be used to close the door of advancement
against such as they, and to fix new disabil
ities and burdens upon them till all of liberty
shall be lest.
Imperialism involves a departure from prin
ciples which were universally accepted in this
country two years ago. 'jTo know that all men
are created equal one needs not the wisdom of
a rage or the learning of the schools. It was
declared to be a self evident truth, it was evi
dent to those who pledged their lives to the
maintenance of the Declaration of Independence
and it is evident still to those who are not
blinded by the glamour or wealth and the glit
tering promises of a colonial system. If all
men are created eounl and endowed with In
alienable rights, it follows as a logical and a
Jiecjessary sequence that governments were in
stituted for t^e welfare of all and derive their
Just iwjwers from the consent of the governed.
On the ;<;eFervatlon of this doctrine our hopes
depend; if. it Is abandoned there is no founda
tion upon which a government like ours can
be constructed. Do not allow yourselves to be
deceived by those who question the capacity
of this people or that people for self-govern
ment.
I If this nation adheres to the doctrine that
i governments derive their just powers from
the consent of the governed, and the people
have an easy I and ready means of correcting
oil abuses, the GoverBr.ient will not need to
be supported by a large permanent army, for
every citizen will be ready to defend such a
Government from attack. The only domestic
luse for a large standing army is to suppress
P>y force that discontent which should be
(cured by legislation. -
To suuport a permanent army of 100,000 men
, requires approximately one-half as much
j money es is annually expended for education
j la the United States. How much cheaper Is It
to uplift people by gentle and peaceful process
of Intellectual development than to blow them
up with powder and dynamite.
As to Imperialism.
I opporturlty to vote on public questions when
those questions can be submitted without too
treat Inconvenient" and expense. But the la
j I'ont n2T my n is f ven mori? 1 ntt*r^st Â£ J in the
:>ro:>osltion to establish a labor bureau with a
Cabinet officer at its head. If labor is given a

trusted representative of the people for whom
he speaks, and hl.i rrf-sence at Cabinet meet
j Ings will fjive to thos? who toil for their dally
; bread assurances that their Interests will be
i properly guarded.
I Mr. Oompers. the chief executive of the Fed
eration of Labor, has in his correspondence with
the ?4?cretHry of tli3 Treasury so ably presented
the laboring man's reasons for opposing a. gold
standard and a. nitional bank currency that it
is nut necessary to discuss these questions at
1 this time.
| The labcrlne- man has abundant reasons to
| fear t^e trusts. Mr. Charles 14. Kllnt In a
! sr>4>rh delivered in Boston more than a year
ago In defense of the trusts frankly asserts that
onÂ« of the advantages of these combinations is
that' "in case of local strikes or fires the work
goes on elsewhere, thus preventing periou*
Inss." Is it possible that any wage earner i-an
fall to bee how completely the trusts place the
employe at the mercy of the employer?
The resolutions adopted by various labor or
! ganizations in condemnation of militarism and
j imperialism justify me in making a Jirief ref-
I frenre to thCMe questions. No class contributes
! more than the laboring- class in proportion to
! its r.umt>ers to the rank and file of the army; no
j class ccntrlbutt-s more in proportion to its num
bers to tlio expense of the army and no class is
I more menaced by the existence of a large army.
Mom of the countries in Europe which main
tain large military establishments collect an
income tax which adjusts the burden of the
government to the income of the citizen. Here
cur federal taxes ar<> largely collected upon
consumption, and while they are income taxes
in the sense that they must be paid cut of the
incomes of the people, yet the exactions are
proportionate to the income. The taxes upon
consumption bear heaviest upnn the poor anil
| lightest upon the rich, and arc. In fact, graded
i Income taxes, the per cent' collected decreasing
j as the income increases.
The blacklist, by m^ans of which the em
ployers combine to deprive the discharged
workman of re-employment, is one of the more
recent menaces to the laboring man. The in
dependence of the wage-earner decreases as
th* difficulty of obtaining employment in
creases. The laboring man is also interested
in legislation prohibiting Oriental immigra
tion. The political objections to Oriental la
bor are scarcely less weighty than the
economic ones. Race prejudice cannot be dis
regarded. We cannot afford to bring; into this
country those who cannot amalgamate with
our people.
The attempt to use the Injunction of a court
to deprive the laboring man of trial by Jury
should alarm all our people, for while the
wage-earner is the first to feel its effects, the
l.rtr.cirle which underlies government by In
junction is so far-reaching that no one can
hope to escape ultimately. The thing forbid
den by an injunction would without the In
junction be cither legal or illegal. If It would
Â»* local the Judge usurp* the function of the
legislature when he forbids it. If it would
be illegal the injunction of tho court Is un
necessary, for any one who violates the law
can. upon conviction. Â¦ be made to suffer the
penalties prescribed for such violation. The
meanest thief and the most brutal murderer
are entitled to trial by Jury- Why should this
right be denied to the laboring man?
And yet corporate influence is so etronsr that
it has thus far been impossible to secure any
remedial legislation.
The fact that United States Senators are
elected by Legislatures rather than by the peo
ple directly lessens the laboring man's influ
ence in securing favorable legislation. When
the action of a political convention must be
Hubmitted to the voters for ratification at the
jjolli. the convention is constrained to nominate
a candidate acceptable to the people, but when
a Fenator is chosen by a Legislature the Indi
vidual voter is far less considered.
The laboring man favors direct legislation
wherever practicable for the same reason that
he favors the election of Senators by popular
VOt*.
Direct legislation brings the government
nearer to the vctor. ThÂ» jwopi* should fca, v Â« an
Blacklist a Menace.
We shall all go up nr down together. Some
may BO up or fro down further than others, but.
disresardinjr special exceptions, the rule is that
we rruFt all share in cemmon something of
whatever adversity or whatever rrosi>erity is in
etore for the nation as a whole. In the long
run each section of the community will rise
fir fall as the community rises or falls. If
hard times come to the nation, whether as the
result of natural causes nr because they are
invited by our own folly, all of us will suffer.
Ortain of uÂ« will suffer nwre and others less,
but all will suffer somehow.
On the other hand Providence and our own
eneriry and ijoo.d sense brinp prosperity to us
all who share in that prosperity. We will not
all share alike, but something each one of un
will tret. I^ot us strive to make the conditions
of life FUch that as nearly as possible each
man shall receive the share to which he is hon
estly entitled and no mure; and let us remem
ber at the same time that our efforts must be
to build up rather than to strike down, and
that we can best help ourselves, not at the ex
pense of others, but by heartily working with
them for the common Rood of each and all.
It was 4 o'clock when Colonel Bryan bo
gan. Discussinp the question of how the
wage-earner could secure thct share of
the earth's bounties and the Government's
protection he deslrna Mr. oryan said:
The associations formed by workingmen
have been productive of much good. The la
bor organization rs we now find it is the prod
uct of industrial conditions. The individual
found himself at a disadvantage when deal
ing with the corporate employer, and the or
panization not only enables him to contend
for his rights upon terms more nearly equal,
but it stimulates him to study and understand
the conditions vhlch surround him.
The labor organization has been foremost
in advocating the reforms which have already
been secured. Several years ago the secret bal
lot was demanded' by the waKc-earners for
their own protection. That ballot has been ob
tained and through its operations thow who
toil for individuals or corporations are able
to protect their political rights and to use the
ballot according to their own Judgment. This
is a longr step in advance.
The labor orcanl nation has done much to
lessen the evils of child labor and has also
contributed toward the shortening of the hours
afjtoil. and !t should not cease its efforts tin
trl the eipht-hour day is secured. The labor
organization has bet^n a consistent and per
sistent advocate of the doctrine of arbitration.
The court of arbitration is one of the certain
ties of the future, and when It Is secured and
perfected we shall wonder why its coming was
delayed so long.
The one fact which all of us need to keep
FHadily before our eyes is the need that per
formance shall square with promise if Rood
work is to be <!nne, whether in the industrial
or the fK>litical world. Nothing- does more to
prompt mental dishenesty and moral insincerity
than the habit of either promising- the Impos
sible or of demanding the performance of the
impossible or finally of failing to keep a prom
ise that has l-Â»-en made; and it makes not the
slightest difference whether it If a promise
mud* on the stump or off the stump. Kemem
ber that there are two sides to the wrong thus
committed. There is first the Wrong of falling
to keep a premise made, and in the next place
there is the wrong of demanding the impos
sible, and therefore forcing or permitting weak
or unscrupulous men to make Â»i promise which
they either know or should know cannot be
kept. So small part of our trouble :n dealing
with many of the gravest social questions, such
as the so-called labor question, the trust ques
tion and others like them, arises from these
two attitudes. The success of the law for the
taxation of franchises recently enacted in New
York State offers a striking contrast to the
n.mi lettÂ» breakdown of the siÂ«?cies of crude and
violent anti-trust legislation which has been
sr> often attempted and which has always failed
because of its very crudeness and violence to
make any impression upon the real and dan
gerous evil? which have excited such just popu
lar resentment.
Promises Should Be Kept.
be the exact limit of lnfluer.ee allowed the
state or what limit shall be set to that right
of individual initiative eo dear to the hearts
of the American i>eople. All we can say is
that the need has lÂ»-en fhown on one hand for
action by the people in thÂ»*ir collective capac
ity through the state in many matters; that
in other mr.tters much can !>Â«â¢ dune by asso
ciations of different etoujs of individuals, as
in tra-ies unions and similar organization;-, and
that in othf-r matters it n-malns now as true
as ever that final success will be fur the man
Â¦who trusts In the Etrusjde only to his cool
head, his brave heart and his strong right arm.
There are ej heren in which the state can prop
erly act and ppheres m whlrh a comparatively
free field must be given to individual initiative.
Though the conditions of life have grown so
ruMlir.gr in their complexity, though the
chanpes have been fo vast, yet we may remain
atsr.iutÂ»!y sure of one thinpâ that now, as ever
in the past, and it will ever be in the future,

CELEBRATIONS ON THE COAST.
"Hello," laughed Mr. Bryan, turning a
smiling face upon the scared people,
"this can't be a Democratic platform.
There are no bad planks in that. Come,
now, stand still, won't you? If you
stand together where you are you will be
all right. If you stampede it will fall en
you," and he laughed as if it was an
everyday, occurrence. His self-assurance
had a quieting effect on the crowd. When
the dust cleared away it was found thai
a few people had been precipitated into
the chamber under the stand, but none
were seriously injured.
CHICAGO, Sept. 3.-By a trite 'little
joke sprung with cool but effective decla
mation, W. J. Bryan to-day arrested a
stampede of frantic men and women in
t the speakers' stand at Electric Park, pre
venting a panic.
The Nebraskan had just fought his way
through the crowd and had taken his
place in front of thp orators' platform
when the overcrowded lloor of the small
stand creaked and began to waver. A
section of the worn floor gave way.
women -shrieked in terror and men tried
to jump over the railing on the heads of.
the packed throng at the rear of the
stand.

-n -T EW YORK. Sept. 3.â In view of the
l\ I fact that there was no peneral pa-
I \j rade of labor In this city and that
I \ many downtown business houses
were closed, the city was quiet to
day. Most of the trade organizations left
the city by early trains and boata for their
outings, each liavins a programme of Its
own. A Labor day parade was held in
Jersey City under the auspices of the
United Building Trades Council of Hudson
County. An Incident of this parade was
the action of the Central Federated Union
in refusing to inarch past the grrand stanA
in front of the City Hall, where the parade
was reviewed by Mayor Hoos and other
officials.
The Central Federated Union !s com
posed largely of silk weavers and brewery
employes, a large number of whom ariÂ»
professed Socialists and opponents of both
political parties.. When they were two
blocks from the grand stand the men of
the Central Federated Union fell out of
line and made a. iletour so as to avoid
passing the stand.

CHICAGO. Sept. S.â Orgnnized labor
tn Chicajro to-day passed in re
view before Colonel W. J. Bryan
and Colonel Theodore RoosevclL
Hour after hour the labor unions
passed down Michigan avenue past the
Auditorium Hotel, on the loggia of which
stood the Democratic nomineÂ© for Presi
dent and the Republican Vice Presidential
candidate, tog-ether with C. A. Towne,
Senator William E. Mason and a. dozen
other political leaders. Both Bryan and
Roosevelt were heartily greeted by the
men as they marched past the hotel.
When the last-man of the long line of
marchers had swung round Michipan ave
nue into Jackson boulevard Colonel Bryan
and Colonel Roosevelt went Inside the
hotel, whe:Â«> soon after they pat down to
Â« luncheon piven by labor representatives.
It was a "Hag: of truce" luncheon, for the
trades union men had decided that in the
celebration of l^abor day there was to be
no politic?
While the parade was moving a host of
people, mostly th<Â» families of working
ffion, Kathered !n Electric I'ark. where the
fpi-cches of th^ day were delivered.

cial an<l induFtrial needs â remedies, rights and
wronjrsâ a ton of oratory is not worth an
ounce of h:ir<i-hÂ«-,ade<1, kindly common ser.se.
Th? fundamental law of healthy political life
In this rreat republic is that each man shall,
in deed and not merely in word. l>e treated
Ftrii-tlj- on hlB worth as a man; that each
Fhali do fu'l justice to his fellow-, ami in re
turn shall exact full justice from him. Each
group of men baa its siiecial interests, and yet
the hijrher. the broader and deeper interests
are thoÂ»e which apply, to all men alike, for
the rriirit of brotherhood in American citizen-
Fhip, when rishtly understood and rightly ap
plied, is more important than aupht else. Let
us scrupulously rÂ«g&ni the special Interest of
the wageworker. the farmer, the manufacturer
Â»nJ the merchant, jrivinp to each man h>Â»
due and also teeeing that he doeÂ« not wrong
hi* fellows; but let us ever keep clearly be
fore our minds the great fact that, where the
<iee:>est chords are touched, the interests of
a!! are alike and must Im.- fruarded alike.
lilust Beware of Hatred.
TY> must beware of eny attempt to make
hatred in any form the basis of action. Most
emphatically each of us needs to stand up for
hlÂ« own rijrhts; all men and all groups of men
are bound to retain their self-respect, and in
demanding this same rapect from others to
see that they are not injured, and that ther
have secured to them the fullest liberty of
thought and action: but to feel that a grudge
ripair :*t others, while it may or may not harm
them, is sure in the Ions run to do i:.::iuivly
treater harm to the man himself.
The more a healthy American sees of one's
fellow-Americans the greater grows his con
viction that our chief iroub'es come from mu
tual misunderstanding â from failure t>> appre
ciate one another's DOlnt of view. In other
words the preat need is fellow fee-linir, sym
pathy, brotherhood: pji4 all this naturally
comes by association. It is. therefore, of \ital
importance that there should be such associa
tion. The most serious disadvantage in city
life is the tendency of each man to keep
Isolated in his own little set. and to look upon
the vast majority of his fellow citizens indif
ferently *o that he soon comes to forjjet that
they have thÂ«Â« same red bcOOd. the same love
and hate, the same likes and dislikes, the
Fame desire for good, and the same perpetual
tendency, ever needing to be checked and cor
rected, to lapse from good into evil. If only
*>ur i*ople can be thrown together where they
act on a common ground with the same mo
tives and hav* the same objects, we need net
have much fear of their failing to acquire a
per.ulne respect for one another; and with such
respect there must finally come fair play for
all. Ir. the country districts the surrounding:!
Â«re pu'-h that a man can usually work out hiÂ»
own fate by himself to the best advantage. In
our cities, or where men eon|:ref;ate in masses.
It is often necessary to work in combinationâ
that is. through uFsociatlonF. by trades union?.
Of course, if managed unwisely, the very
power of such union or organization makes
It capable of dcJiiiE much harm, but on the
whole it would be hard to overestimate the
rood these organizations have done in the past
if.: still harder to estimate the pood they can
do in the future If bandied with resolution,
forethought, honesty and sanity.
The Right to Regulate.
It Is not rosFlb'.e to lay down a hard an1
fast rule loprlcaJly perfect aÂ« to where the State
Fhell and where the 'ndividual shall be left
ur.haTrjxred and unhelped.
%Ve have exactly the same ri?ht to repulate
the conditions of life and work in factories and
tenement houses that we have to retaliate tire
escapes in our houses. In certain communities
the exlFter.ce of a thorouchly efficient depart
ment of factory inspection is just as essential
a* the establishment of a flre department. How
far we shall po in repulatin* the hours of labor
or the liabilities of employers is a matter of
expediency and each case must be determined
on its own merits, exactly as it is a matter of
expediency to determine what so-called "pub
lic utilities" the community shall itself own
and what ones it Fhall leave to private or cor
porate ownership, securing to itself merely the
rlÂ«fht to regulate. Sometimes one course is ex
pedient. Kometlmrs another.
In aridrf-Fs-ing an audience like this I don't
have fÂ» Fay that the law of life is work, and
lhat work in Itself, fo far from beins any
hardship, is a great blessing, provided always
that it if carried on under conditions which
preserve a man's self-respect and which al
low him to develop his own character and
rear bis children so that he and they, as well
aJ> the whole community of which he and they
are a part, may steadily march onward and
upward. The idler, rich or poor, is at best use
less, and is generally a noxious member of the
community. To whom much has bee n given,
from him much Is rightfully expected; and a
heavy burden of responsibility rests upon the
man of means to Justify by his actions the fo
cial conditions which have rendered it poÂ»
rible for him or his forefathers to accumu
late and to keep the property he enjoys. He
le net to be excused if he doeÂ« not render
full measure of service to the state and com
munity at large. There are many ways In
which thir service can be renderedâ lij art, in
literature. In philanthropy, as a statesman 'and
u. soldier; but in some way he is in honor
bound to render it. fo that benefits may ac
crue to his. brethren who have been less favored
liy fortune than he has TJeen. In short, he must
work not only for himself but for others. If he
does not work he falls not only in his duty
to the reÂ«Â»t of the community. t>ut he falls sig
nally in his duty to himself. There is no need
of envying: the lflle. Ordinarily we can afford
tr> treat them with impatient contempt; for
when they fail to do their duty they fall to
get from life the highest and the keenest pleas
ure that life can give.
Industrial Problems Loom.
To <3o our duty; that Is the* summing up of
the whole matter. We must do our duty by
ourselves and we must <Jo our duty by our
neighbors. liefore us loom up Industrial prob
lems, vast in their importance and their com
plexity. The last half century has been one
of extraordinary social and industrial devel
opment. The changes have been far-reachingâ
#cme of them for good and some of them for
evil. It is not given to the wisest of us to
see into the future with absolute clearness. No
tnin can be certain that ne has found the en
tire Bolution of this infinitely great and intri
cate problem, and yet each nun of us if he
Â¦would do his duty must strive- manfully so
far as In him llea to help bring about that so-

serious remarks, but he believed it was

more serious questions of unionism. The
burden of his words was that the union.?
should keep strong organizations and
stand together. He had noticed, he said,
that in times of depression those unions

organizations came out of the depression

be between the ages of ten and twenty
months, and accompanied by their moth
ers. There were a score or more entered,
the mothers receiving nearly as much at
tention as the babies, and the crowds
cheered for their favorite baby or mother
and prompted the judges until the de
cision was rendered in favor of Ethel
Murray, a diminutive specimen, who
crowed with the crowd over her own vi<-
tory. Katie Williams was a good second,
and it was on third prize that the boys
had first chance. Joseph Beale was tnird,
and then another ctrl baby. Georgia Cro

ST. PATRICK'S PARISH
SOUGHT SAN RAFAEL
and Defeated All Comers
With Ease.
Father Brady Was the Crack Sprinter
About 7000 people attended yesterday at
Schuetzen Park, near San Rafaer. the an
nual picnic of St. Patrick's parish. Tha
excursion was a great success. There wero
no accidents to mar the day, and every
body returned to the city tired out but
enthusiastic over the day's pleasure. Tho
first contingent from the parish arrivea
in the park about 11 o'clock. They were
reinforced by trainloads of people throush
out the day.
The forenoon was spent by the merry
pleasure-seekers on the grounds, and by
noon the crowd was distributed into littlo
squads, who devoured the contents of tht>
substantial lunch baskets with ravenous
appetites. Promptly at 2 o'clock athletic
sports commenced. They were handle'!
with good judgment under the ablo direc
tion of T. L>. Doran, Jim Hughes ami
William Flynn. Mr. Flynn acting in tha
capacity of starter.
The feature of the sports was thÂ« sprint
ing of Father Barry of St. Patrick's
parish. The boys tried to give him thrÂ»
laugh when he stepped to the scratch in
the sodality race, but when they were ofC
at the first quarter he was three lengths*
in the lead, at the half he had six to his
credit and he won pulling up.
Mrs. Conner was the crack scorcher in
all the ladies' events. She won a parasol
in one race, and was busy the rest of tha
afternoon trying to trade It off for some
thing more useful.
Eugene Lacy was the chairman of the
committee of arrangements, and he de
serves great credit for the way the picnio
was conducted. Father Cummings thra
pastor of the parish, was all around thfÂ»
grounds all day and made it his business
to see that everybody had a good time.

The choice fell upon Miss Emma Mc-
Kay, as pretty a girl as ever came
through the park gates, and no one
blamed the judge for his choice.
The tugs-of-war caused great excite
ment, and if the force of the rooting and
the cheers could have been put upon the
rope it would have been snapped like a
thread. Instead it held stoutly to the
victory of the carpenters and the defeat
of all the other teams. There were four
in the contest â carpenters, derrickmen,
sailors and cement-worker. The carpen
ters first pulled the sailors over the
cleats; then the cement-workers pulled
the derrickmen from their places and
then the carpenters danced the cement
workers over the platform amid great en
thusiasm.
The other games and races were as fol
lows:
for smiles and complicated his work and
increased his fear of making a mistake.
There were many to choose from, and his
was a hard task, but along toward twi
light, purposely so darkness might hide
beauties he had overlooked, he rendered
his decision.
Before the' literary exercises the crowds
had not -been idle, nor were they even
way. Is It not stronger to all come to
gether to form a perfect whole? A chea.p
organization can accomplish nothing, "a* 1
an organization can accomplish very lit
tle. There Is safety only in all organizing
together." ,
Arthur R. Andre was the next speaker.
He opened by a reference to Labor flay,
describing it as a day not for the Jolllfl
i cation over the increase of wages an.i
' the reduction of hours only, but a day
dedicated to the dignity of labor and in
recognition of labor as the foundation of
society. He spoke of the power of or
ganization and of the necessity for a.d
laboring men to stand together.- He spoke,
too. of the union label and the tre
mendous influence exerted when every
man demanded that what he ate and what
he wore and everything he used that wad
made by hands bore the union label, the
proof that it was made by union men. He
who does this, he said, is an honorary
member of every union in the land; he is
a union man indeed. The speaker then
referred to the political influence of union
ism when brought to bear upon legisla
tion for the benefit of or to the detriment
of organized labor. The time will come,
he said, when the unions will have their
own representatives in the legislative halld
and they will not have to watch from the
lobby that the laws are not worked to
their harm. . . .
John E. McDougald followed with a few
remarks upon the day and its history. He
spoke, too, of the power of the ballot,
and said there could be no real advance
ment in unionism until labor had learned
this lesson. In referring to the labor agi
tator he said: "The labor agitator is a
benefactor. It is through him that wages
are kept up and shorter hours are main
tained. It is he who fights the battle,
who bears the brunt and who is first to
be discharged. A labor organization
without an agitator might as well not
exist." -1; .
The last speaker of the day was O. A.
Tveitmoe. He said organized labor was
not 'ulone to decrease hours &.r.d to raise
pay. It was far more for the better edu
cation of the people; for better govern
ment; for better homes: for contentment
and happiness. He believed its mission
was to bring peace into the world and i
avoid strife by securing justice to all.
President McCarthy then closed the ex
ercises with a few words. "The eight
hour day has come to stay,' he shouted,
amid the cheers of the audience, "and no
power betwen this and heaven can bar
its progress."
Between speeches there was music, and
the crowds left the auditorium to the
lively notes of a march.

The Summary.
In addition to tho regular card to-mor
how there will be a pony race with gen
tlemen riders up, -which is axpected to be
a fetching society stunt.
Officers made a clean up of touts? at the
track, a batch of about seventeen being
told to leave town.
Starter Pat Reagan had a big bunch of
fourteen to send down the chutes in the
last race, a seven furlong run. After Pilot
and Abnno had shot their bolts, young
Farrell dropped along with Lodestar, and
bv clever riding, won as he pleased from
Flush of Gold and Abano. The winner
receded from 3 to 2 to threes.
Ab Stemler tried Farrell. a stable lad on
Eonic, in the two-year-old number, and 7
to 10 was accepted about the filly. Gill
Summers thought his Bassetlaw filly was
the thing and the smart ones strung theirs
that way, getting 9 to 5. It proved the
leal thing, for Mounce had Bavassa in
front from the jump, and beat the favor
ite hands down. Spain War came from
behind, taking the show.
After opening a 3 to 2 chance for the
first running event Formero, with Ruiz
up. went to 5 and 6. and then won almost
handily. Amasa was first away, but quit
when the clip became too hot. In a mild
drive, p-ormero earned the verdict over tne
top-weighted Toribio by a neck. The fa
vorite Herculean, away none too wen,
made no showing at all. Neither did Jen
nie Reid.
Favorite Herculean Also Runs.
the half was reached Freder
icksburg was leading, and in the run home
it looked all over. A sixteenth from home,
though, he made a "jimmy," and Tags
ended the game by once more -..sposlng of
Enoch and winning first money.
The Woodland driver. C. B. Bigelow.
made it three straight with Tags in the
green class pace, selling second choice In
the auction pooling. Fredericksburg found
ready purchasers at 20, Tags going for 7
and the field 6.
: Jennie S. with the pole position, led un
til nearly to the stand in the opening heat,
when in an exciting drive Bigelow behind
Tags came with a rush, winning by a neck
in 2:15'^. Bunch with the favorite trailed,
getting through in time to finish a good
third. Still the crowd wanted nothing
but Fredericksburg. Again Tags fought it
out all the way, this time downing Enoch
a head in a desperate pace, superbly driv
en. Coming out for the third heat Freder
icksburg sold for 20. Tags 8 and the field 4.
Strangely enough, the first named pacer
was a 3 to .1 chance in the books as well.
Then the uncorking happened.
Tags in Three Straight,
For thp accommodation of those wishing
to speculate five pencilers passed out
pasteboards. John Humphrey chalked up
price's; followed by Fitzgerald & Co.. Cav
anaugh & Co. and Hughey Jones, but Joe
Harlan "went it alone." The first four
were accused of trying to syndicate it. ana
it was said made strenuous efforts to
freeze Harlan out. However, he booked
under the name of Rider & Co., and the
talent is happy over the ripe prices laid
in most instances.
The ring broke about oven to-day. It
didn't como so easy fur the choices after
the win of Eulah Me. Fredericksburg, over
which Charley Bunch played a lone hand

his field at pleasant odds, pulling the
losers out in the afterpiece.

In the judges' stand J. W. Wilson, as
usual, presided, and M. D. Chamberlain,
another director of the society, as asso

lost none of his cleverness, or tact. The
timers were R. J. Hayey and "Hanger"
Jones. Pat Reagan dispatched the run

cess.
Eiilali Me Away First.
Starter Covey quickly gave the quartet
the word, with the favorite, trailed by
Vendome, showing the way. At the live

SACRAMENTO.
Sacramento 6, Oakland 2.
"They began the struggle with errors,
but later on they redeemed themselves
and by the force of their 'swinging arms
turned black defeat into glowing victory."
Sacramento committed four distinct
breaches of baseball propriety yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Park, two of
which gave the Dudes their only runs and
the lead for a moment or two. Then the
Statesmen fell to and made a show of
Farrow, Ewing's latest In curve dispens
ers. A clean dozen of hits, most of them
served in large packages, were responsible
for the Senatorial victory. Doyle was
a stranger to the Dudes, who unraveled
his delivery but four times.
The game was devoid of excitement,
althougn there were a couple of startling
plays mat brought the hands of fanatics
together and their feet hard upon thetloor.
A one-handed catch by Mclaughlin near
the left lield fence was the preuiest piece
ot out-rield work this season has so far
produced and it was a valuable catch too.
Two Dudes were on the sacks at the time
and the hit would have been a double
were it not eaten up by Mclaughlin.
Francks was the other medal earner, his
stopping of bristling grounders being a
feature of the piay.
Sacramento began to solve Mr. Farrow
at the outset. A single by Dt-vereaux, a
double by Hughes and an error by Kane,
who played third for the Dudes, were all
Instrumental In sending the "Reddog'"
over the plate. The score did not remain
in Sacramento's favor very long, for in
the same Inning Francks glided to first on
Kagan's error and did the run act when
Arrellanes became bold enough for a
three-sack swat. The third inning prom
ised a cyclone of runs for the Dudes, but
ended with a single stroke of the bell.
Farrow, Hutchlnson ami Francks were
ornamenting the bags when Arrellanes
came to the plate. Three murderous cut?
at the air w r ere all he achieved. Soon after
this Francks becamo gay at first and
would have died, but Hanlon allowed the
ball to run through him. so Farrow
scored.
The fourth was all the champions want
ed. Doyle and Stultz. who went to the
sacks on hits, scored on Rice's three
bagger. Rice crossed the rubber on Mc-
Laughlin's sinrrle. That was all Sacra
mento needed to win the game, but in tho
fifth and seventh Farrow was so kind and
easy that two other runs were added to
the list. The score:
Doyle Proved an Enigma to the TJn
lucky Dudes, Who Found His
Curves Only Four
Times.
Nothing in His Curves That
Puzzled SacrameDto
Batsmen.

every employe of McNab & Smith, union or
non-union, new union or any old union, to

McNab.
In half an hcur it camo. The new union
had won the battle, and to-day heavy
trucks wiil rumble ir. the business section
as of yore.
ThÂ« c.-ius-e leading up to the discharge
of the tiiiee men is admitted by McNab
to have luin in the fact that ho had been
requited, as the largest drayowner in
the city, to break the back of the new
brotherhood, in order that :m organization
known as the Draymen's Union and com
posed of bosses and men mi^ht regain
the prestige it had before the birth of the
new brotherhood, whose membership is
confined to teamsters. The infant union
shows every indication of being a lusty
youngster and its growth in % membership
frightened the city rlrnyowners, -who
feared a demand for increased pay. Mc-
Nab. however, asserts that a rival dray
iv.s; firm offered the new union a bonus of
SitH if it could succeed in boycotting Mc-
Nab & Smith In the labor market. This
the men also admit.
After the consultation yesterday after
noon McNab informed the strikers that
the three discharged men would be re
instated. The men all through the affair
have behaved quietly and claim that every
teamster in the city would have stood by
them had the men not been put back to
work.

The man who received the nomination
for State Senator is Hilliard E. Welch,
also a Lodi man. by a strangecoincidence.
He is young and tall and promises to
make a hot fight for the place against
August E. Muenter.-Uhe Republican nomi
nee. Mr. Welch has not been in politics
long, but has moved along lively. Three
years ago he graduted from the Lodi High
School, and has since filled the position
of bookkeeper for a local merchandising
firm. His rise in politics has surprised his
friends. He attended the convention in
tending to capture the chairmanship of
the County Central Committee, but was
headed off by Stockton politicians and
given the nomination for State Senator
Some allege that it was a "Job" and that
the nomination was handed out as a gold
brick. However. Mr. Welch Is in the fight
with the determination to stay, though
admittedly heavily handicapped. Muenter
has had one term in the Assembly and
has years, experience and wealth behind
him. The local man has none of these
It is doubtful if a man of Welch's yearsâ
26â has ever received such an Important
nomination in the history of California
politics. He Is a native of Shasta County,
but has resided here for a number of
years. The young aspirant is popular.
Special Dl5?atch to The Call.
LODI, Sept. 3. â The passing from pub
lic life of State Senator B. F.
Langford, the father of the upper
house, came somewhat as a sur
prise to this section of the State.
For nearly a quarter of a century the
farmer-politician has served the Demo
cratic party in California, and for twenty
years he has gone up from this district
to succeed himself in the Senate.
The end came Saturday at the Demo
cratic County Convention at Stockton, as
announced in The Call. Senator Lang
ford was there, but it was his wish that
his name be withheld from nomination.
He had no desire to run again,
and beyond speeches of thanks for his
services in the past decade, but little stir
was made over his retirement to private
life. Langford is now serving his twenty
first year as a Senator. That he has al
ways succeeded himself in a Republican
district speaks highly of his standing
among voters of all parties.
Senator Langford lives in the midst of
one of the largest colony orchards in the
United States, and h!s' home is a model
of beauty and comfort, though he him
self is always a plain kindly farmer, out
side of the legislative sesr-lons. Since 1S52
he has resided near Lodi. locating- long
before the town was dreamed of. He was
born in Smith County, Tennes?e, in 1829.
and came to California in lS5o, by way of
the isthmus. He mined at Douglas Flat.
Murphy's Camp, Poverty Bar and other
place?;" teamed; did a merchandising busi
ness and fought Indians, and bears the
sc:\rs yet of wounds received in battle
with the Reds.
Years ago he foresaw that this would
eventually prove one of the chief fruit
growing centers of the State, and at once
laid out a great colony plan, being the
first large farmer in the county to cut up
his farm into small tracts. The plan was
more than successful, as to-day several
thousand acres of his once famous wheat
land is orchards and vineyards. This
tract is now famous as the "Langford
Colony," the Senator's home being located
in the midst of what hap always been
termed tho largest almond orchard in the
1'nited State?.
Senator Langford is president of the
Bank of Lodi and largely interested ir.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ., Sept. 2.â The delegates
to the Republican State convention are
arriving and the town is being handsome
ly decorated in honor of the event.
The Armory, where the sessions are to
be held, has been beautifully decorated.
On the outside there are strings of ban
ners.^/They reach from the top of the
flagpole to the porch. The interior of the
Armory presents a pretty sight. Across
the platform at the east end of the hall
a sounding board has been constructed
and painted a light blue. Above this
board is a festoon of bunting of gold
color. On it are the figures "1S50â 1900."
To one side is a white satin banner, with
the motto, "Prosperity at Home, Pres
tige Abroad." On a similar banner on the
other side appears the motto, "One Coun
try, One Flag." On the sounding board
is a purple banner, with the seal of the
State, and to each side on a background
of gold, are the pictures of McKinley and
Roosevelt.
Below the purple banner is another,
upon which is the picture of Washington,
beside which on shields are the likenesses
of Lincoln and Grant.
A piano Is on the platform for the use
of the leader of the singers, a targe
chorus of whom will furnish the vocal
music for the convention.
In front of the platform are tables for
the use of the press.

ST. JOHN'S FAIR WILL
RUN TWO MORE NIGHTS
Bazaar at Old St. Mary's College in
the Mission a Splendid
Success.
St. John's bazaar is such a success that
Father Brady has decided to run it for
two more nights this week. Last night
the attendance was ad large as ever and
more money was added to the funds to
ward building a church for St. John's
parish, which is the only parish in San
Francisco that does not own a church.
St. Anthony's booth, under the direction
of Mrs. Mclnerney. is as popular as ever.
The booth has a fresh stock of goods anil
there are some of the most beautiful sam
ples of needlework there that have ever
been sold In a church fair. The soda foun
tain 1<* the rendezvous of the swell boys
of the parish who want to make a big 1
hit with their best gills. Mrs. and the
Misses Supple look after the fountain
and are kept busy all through the even
ing. Holly Park bootli has made a big
hit. Mrs. Morrisey haa some real Irish
lace sent out and it was sold the ttrst
night it was on exhibition. She has a
few genuine blackthorn sticks left which
she will sell at a very low figure. Mrs.
McCann Is in this booth and i? one of the
first to arrive at the lair and one of the
last to leave.
The fair will run to-night and to-morrow
nipht. If you have not visited the place
you will only have two more nights In
which to do so. Take a Mission-street car
and ask the conductor to let you off at
old St. Mary's College.

BOTH the Republican and the Democratic party
have placed in their national platforms this
year a plank containing declarations in favor of
labor. There is. however, a wide difference in thc
two. and difference is characteristic of the divergence
between the methods of the opposing parties., One
promises to workingmen thc enactment of legislation
which will improve tin ir conditions; thc other prom
ises nothing more than the creation of a new office,
ostensibly to be filled by a representative workingman,
but which might be used as thc reward of some Dem
ocratic agitator.
The Republican platform, after pointing out how
beneficial to labor has been the policy of protection
which encourages inventive genius and provides work
and wages for persons of varied tastes and talents.
?pys: "In the further interest of American labor we
favor a more effective restriction on thc immigration
o. r cheap labor from foreign lands, the extension of
opportunities of education for working children, the
raising of thc age limit for child labor, thc protection
of free labor against contract convict labor and an
effective system of labor insurance."
The .Democratic platform, after denouncing the
protective tariff as a trust-breeding measure, says:
"In the interest of American labor and the upbuilding
of the workingman, ss the cornerstone of the pros
perity of our country, we recommend that Congress
create a department of labor in charge of a secretary
with a scat in the Cabinet, believing that thc eleva
tion of thc American laborer will bring with it in
creased production and increased prosperity to our
country at home and our commerce abroad."
Such are the labor platforms of the two parties.
One contains a definite programme of reform and
improvement. It provides for protecting the Ameri
can workingm.in against the competition of cheap
hbor in other countries and also against thc immi
gration of cheap laborers to this country. It promises
to free labor protection within thc republic against
the competition of convicts. It proposes to put an
end to the evils of child labor, to give better oppor
tunities of education to such children as are forced
to ?vork. and finally to provide for a system of labor
insurance that will be of benefit to every workingman
and his family.
Against all that the Kansas City platform offers
nothing but the promise of a recommendation to
Congress to create a department of labor. Of what
avail would a secretary of labor be to workingmen
if the protective tariff were overthrown and thce
were no longer employment for thc workers? What
could such an official do to restrict immigration, to
restrain the excessive employment of children, to pro
vide education for youthful workers and to establish
labor insurance?
No intelligent workingman can read these two
THE TWO LABOR PLANKS.
AN INCIDENT IN KANSAS.
KANSAS folks after a brief season of raptu-e,
caused by a belief that their prolific State had
surpassed thc record of the woolly horse by
producing a feathered dog. have been plunged into
confusion by a discovery that the dog is a' fraud. By
reason of this swift change from gladness to despair
the minds of the people are in a turmoil, their feelings
surge from the depths of despair to the heights of in
dignation and there nre times when they are inclined
to slaughter everything in sight that wears feathers.
The story is a pimple one. It appears that for
months past a native has been going about the State
exhibiting a creature that had the form and the bark
of a dog. but which was covered not with hair as a
dog should be. but with feathers. The people were
pleased, but an enterprising reporter seized an oppor
tunity to pluck several feathers from the animal and he
noted that it did not wince. Thereupon the reporter
declared the thing to be a humbug. An investigation
took place and the discovery was made that the dos
had been completely covered from nose to tail with a
tight-fitting coat of canton flannel on which pigeon
feathers had been sown so close as to seem like a
natural growth. When the fraud was exposed the
owner of the dog fled from Kansas and is said to be
headed westward.
The Kansas people can hardly fail to apply to other
affairs of life the lesson they have thus learned and
paid for. There arc a good many feathered frauds
going round the country. There is the Bryan bird,
for example, covered all over with anti-imperial
feathers and posing a? the eagle of liberty. He is
making an exhibition of himself in all parts of the
country and is duping not a few people. When he
shows up in Kansas some enterprising man should
pull some of the anti-imperial feathers and it will
then be seen that the animal doesn't wince. Let a full
investigation be then made and it will be found that
the feathers are merely a false coat upon the old 16
to i dog. Should some Kansas man make that ex
posure Kansas will 'oo speedily rid of Bryan, but we
hope he will not follow th c example of the feathered
dog man and come West.
SHALL men wear shirt waitsts?
That is the new question that has
struck this town and is being vigor
ously canvassed and cMpcussed by
the privileged members of the charmed
circle, the club man. the professional man,
the merchant, the clerk and the laborer.
It is the absorbing topic of the moment.
It is discussed in the mansion and the
cottage. No dinner is known these days
to teach the fish course or the doughnuts
aÂ«s the cafe may be â without that mo
mentous shirt waist question cropping up.
Many a man since the agitation began,
has talked himself dry on the subject.
Opinions are pretty nearly unanimous.
The only difference known to exist be
tween the various shirt waist spielers
lies in the fact that while one eases his
parched throat with Chateau Lalltte, the
other may be wetting his whistle with
steam beer.
Such a commotion has the masculine
shirt-waist question created that the good
citizens who would decide all matters in
conformity with constitutional law and
ordpr arc prcparinR a. clause to tit the
vexed question which they propose to offer
as an amendment to tho new charter.
If was while discussing the possibility
of such an amendment that Mayor Phe
lan consented to make public his indi
vidual views on the shirt-waist question.
"I am decidedly In favor of the shirt
waist for men," said his Honor. "I have
given the matter considerable thoupht and
have come to the conclusion that the
6hirt waist stands as the emblem of
progress. I am for progress and advance
ment. I have given* ample proof of that
in my charter. I intend to bring the
matter before the convention at San Jose
and In the meantime I shall issue an edict
that will compel all employes of the city
to adopt the shirt waist. I shall gener
ously leave the matter of style and color
to tneir own individual taste. However,
all will bo. required to wear the straight
bacKed garment with hemstitched and
tucked fronts; also white shirt waists are
to be strictly tabooed. White stnnds for
purity. 1 consider it decidedly poor taste
lor rriy followers to stoop to the necessity
of calling attention to the purity \)f my
public life. It is superfluous and unntewj
sory."
Mayor Phc'.an has brought along with
him many shirt waists from Paris, and
what Is more, he declares he Is going to
wear them. These French confections
might be added with honor to a belle's
outfit of lingerie.
Promotes Home Industry.
"See here." said the Mayor suddenly, aa
he turned back a corner of a pink gar
ment nrcparatory to folding it away.
"Look! See this diadem, embroidered in
vivid red. with the letters 'J. D. P.' in
tho center. Well, I told those foolish
foreigners that 1 was Mayor of San Fran
cisco and that is how they marked my
shirt waists. The French are a wonderful
nation."
"Do I believe In shirt waists for men?"
echoed Joseph Sadoc Tobln. "Well I
guess I do. I wear them. To me they
mean emancipation. I don't see now how
I ever contrived to play polo without
them. They are very becoming to my
figure. I favor the long straight front ef
fects. "With mo the shirt waist has- been
a cause of live and learn. The nrst one
1 put on did not have the desired effect
and do you know the reason why? I had
forgotten," said the polo player in his
most Insinuating, confidential manner, "I
had forgotten to put on a corset cover. I
got one and it made all the difference in
the world. If you are going to write this
up," said Tobln as he bowed the scribe
out. "don't forget to say that no man
who has an atom of decency and self
respect in his make-up should attempt to
wear a shirt waist without a corset
cover.
McEnerney's Arm Shields.
Garret McEnerney was one of the. first
gentlemen pf this city co' adopt 'the shirt
waist, and In view of that fact the brainy
tones. "Most certainly I do. I am glad
you came to interview me on this subject.
I can answer you as a man and a father.
I said I favored shirt Â¦waists. Now, let us
look the subject in the faco and com<*
carefully to our conclusions. First. I favor
shirt waists for men because It Is tha
fashion. I alwas'3 advise people to follow
the fashion. Second, I favor shirt waists
because they are neat and cool and becom
ing. Third, I favor shirt waists becauseâ â¢
I speak as a father nowâ because they arÂ©
so comfortable when you handiÂ© tha
baby."
Judge Lawlor had decided tha question
of shirt waists before* the interviewer ap
proached him.
"I favor shirt waists." he said, "but I
am not prepared as yet to speak fully en,
the subject. You see some waists art*
plain back and some waists aro pleated
back, and I have not yet sufficiently In
vestigated the matter to commit myseir
in print-
"This much, however. I â¢will Bay," eaid
tho Judge. "I consider thÂ« yoko effects
very cute."
Ned Qreenway haa gona further than
any other man In tho shirt waist matter:
"I have my waists made to order." h*
paid, "and I have gone in for tho very
coolest sort. I have come to that tjme of
life when a man likes to wear big shoe*
end soft collars. I have never found it
necessary to follow fashions. I create
them. The shirt waist I wear la a pleated
back affair, with soft pouch front and long
dress sleeves without cuffs. There Is no
lace on It. I'm not selfish and I would
leave some things exclusively for the girls.
I wear no collar with mine. I find rib
bon, twice around and finished with a
neat bow much more becoming and com
fortable."
McNab a True Patriot
"I have had some troubles In life." saM
Gavin McNab. "but nothing that ever
went beyond this Bhirt waist question.
Hoot mon! Do I believe in the shirt waist?
I believe In anything the Democrats want
and I understand they want those gar
ments. My trouble ia In getting plaid
ones. I had one made up to the China
man's on O'Farrell street the other day.
and, oh, It was awful. The plaids did
not match. I have, since that awful fail
ure taken advice from those competent to
boss in such matters and following thetr
suggestions. I am having one made on
the bias. I shall wear It at San Jose." said
McNab. "and I hope It will do credit to
my politics anÂ«Â« my party."
Walter S. Martin, tho new lieutenant
colonel on the Governor's staff, believes
in tho shirt waist for men. Tho colonel is
not here to speak for himself, but the fol
lowing letter from New York, addressed
to his brother, settles the vexed question
without a doubt:
Pear PÂ»te: I have brought any number of
shirt waists along with me from Parii. It

attorney considered It superfluous to go
into print to voice his approval.
"Shirt waists are all right." said Mc-
Enerney. "and I had no trouble in secur
ing ready-made garments to fit me â
waists suitable in both coloring and tex
ture. But the things that I have bumped
up against are the arm shields.
"po you know," he said, as though pro
claiming a great truth, "that it is abso
lutely necessary if you would wear shirt
waists to wear arm shields? When I got
on to that fact the trouble began. I went
into a fancy goods store and asked the
pretty saleswoman for a pair of arm
shields.
" 'What size?' said she.
" " 'Largest.' said I, and thereupon she
produced a pair of those rubber things
that, upon my soul, would not have been
large enough to fit under a canary bird's
wings. That made me desperate, and I
did not care who knew.
" 'I don't want them for a child,' I
bawled; 'I want them for myself.' You
should have seen that girl behind the
counter blush." said McEnerney. his own
rosy face taking on a deeper hue. "For
a moment she stood with her mouth open
and her eyes staring, and then she gasp
ed. 'We haven't got any to fit you. sir.' "
But the attorney was not to be outdone
by a little thing like that. lie went to the
Goodyear Company, ordered a gross of
shields and is now luxuriating In the "lat

J. C. Kirkpatriek, the genial manager
of the Palace, haa got himself in trouble
on account of shirt waists. Kirkpatriek
has always preached to the myriads of
men under him that the road to success
lay in following the good example of
those whose station and successes in life
made them high and shining marks. It is
this bit of splendid advice, given with the
best of Intentions, that has caused the
manager's undoing.
Kirkpatriek appeared the other day in
all the glory of a fashionable new shirt
waist. It set off his manly figure to per
fection, and, above all. showed his mag
nificent chest expansion to the best ad
vantage. Kirkpatriek had hardly pone

A COMING EVENT AND THE SHADOW IT CASTS BEFOBE.
SOME SPECIMEN TRUSTS.
WHEN this campaign was young and the Bryan
ites were making ready for it by storing up
campaign material for future u=e it occurred to
one of the more zealous and more ignorant of the lot
that it would be a good thing to lift the lid oft t\vi
ice tru.-t in New York and di.-close the monopoly
bugs who were supposed to be 'yi n S snugly under it.
The lid was lifted; and behold nearly every dignitary
of Tammany Hail was found in the monopoly nest.
Ir was a bad break for the Bryanites, for they are
hand and glove with Tammany this year; but they
learned irisdoxn by it. and since then have been more
wary in attacking trusts.
Here is the Examiner of this city for e-xample. It
h as rabid and as foolish a yellow journal as any in
the country, but it i.s- very discreet in dealing with
trusts. It assails this one and attacks that one; but
it never gets so wild but what it carefully smells
around a particular trust before it begins to bark
at it. Thus in ail the yawping of that journal thi
j>ub:ic will note there is a careful abstinence from
even an intimation of anything being wrong with the
way the WeUs-Fargo Express Company does busi
ness. This abstinence is due to the fact that Wcils-
Fargo is like the ice trust in one respect, at least â it
is for Bryan; and the president of the corporation,
Mr. Valentine, has formally declared for him in a
public letter.
Of all the trusts in this country none has been more
greedy or more aggressive than the express company
trast. Four great corporations â the Wells-Fargo, the
American, the Adams and the United States Express
Company â have formed themselves into a combina
tion which absolutely dominates the express trade of
the country. They have not only fixed rates to suit
themselves, but they have divided the whole territory
of the nation among them and have combined tc
assist one another against any possible competitor.
Their profits are enormous, but they are largely illicit
profits, because they have been extorted from the
people by a combination formed in violation of law.
However, Mr. Valentine, president of Wells-Fargo,
has declared for Bryan, and the Bryan organs, warned
by the result of the ice-trust expose, are dumb.
The greed of the express companies trust goes be
yond that of any other trust. Thus Wells- Fargo and
the rest have persistently refused to pay any part of
the tax imposed by Congress to defray the expense
of the war which Rrvan was once so loud in urging
end which he is now equally loud in denouncing. This
tax-shirking corporation is now a Bryanite corpora
tion, and, accordingly, all that it does is justified by
the Bryanitcs. There may be some trusts condemned
with a mighty noise of hijjh-sounding words day after
day by the Examiner, but Wells-Fargo will not be
rmong them. Mr. Valentine has come out for Bryan.
UPON the much discussed subject of reforming
our consular service, Albert H. Washburn,
formerly United States Consul at Magdeburg,
contributes an article to the Forum for September
which contains a suggestion well worth the attention
of reformers. Mr. Washburn holds that neither of
the reform bills now before Congress is likely to pa3s,
r.or is there much chance of any speedy removal of
consular offices from the spoils of party politics, ami
he therefore argues that the only way to bring about
an immediate improvement of the service^s to estab
lish a system of consular inspection similar to that
which prevails in other great departments of the Gov
ernment.
On the question of introducing the merit system
into the service he says: "Any general shaking up of
the service is frowned upon by those who now adorn
it as jeopardizing their official tenure. Broadly
speaking, there are 250 principal consular offices
which are much coveted. Almost every Senator and
Representative has one or more personal or political
friends on this list. As a consequence whenever the
Associated Press contains a dispatch concerning con
sular reform there is a prompt flutter of alarm and
Washington is bombarded with appeals from abroad
more or less frantic to resist at all hazards the pro
posed legislation." The party in power is thus in
disposed to act, while the party out of power, of
course, never thinks of voting to extend the merit
system so as to retain in office the incumbents. Thus
there is a complete deadlock which there is no ap
parent means of breaking.
The establishment of a system of inspection is,
therefore, the one step toward reform that can be at
tained at present. Such a system would not be a
novelty in our administrative methods. The Post
office Department maintains a strong corps of inspec
tors to supervise the mail service. There are inspec
tors in the Treasury Department to supervise cus
toms offices, interml revenue offices and national
banks. Why. then, should there not be inspectors in
the State Department to supervise consulates?
Mr. Washburn says: ''Without multiplying illustra
tions from other departments of the Government,
which would be merely cumulative, it is plainly the
policy of the Government to supervise the official ac
tions of our accredite-i representatives to the Apaches,
but to impose no check whatever upon our repre
sentatives abroad. The folly of this short-sighted
policy is manifest from the flood of complaints re
garding the official and personal conduct of our Con
suls which, serious mid silly alike, deluge the Stale
Department. The complaint of illegal fees is perhaps
the most usual. This abuse of the fee system has
grown up in some instances, it is fair to say, from a
desire, perfectly laudable in the abstract, to collect
money enough for cu-rcnt expenses. Congress, in the
press of other matters, having neglected to provide
decent salaries."
This appears a perfectly fair measure of reform.
There is no reason why consular offices should not
be subject to inspection as well as other public of
fices. Mr. Washburn cites several notorious cases of
wrongdoing that would have been promptly discov
ered and stopped had there been any inspection of the
office where the wrong was going on. It is hardly to
be doubted that the inspection which has proven so
efficacious in other departments would be equally ex
pedient in the Department of State, and since such re
form appears easily attainable it should be supported
by all who are interested in improving our consular
system.

McKINLEY AGAINST BRYAN.
AFTER all is said and done, the issues of the
campaign will be found in their last analyses
to be nothing more than a contest between
McKinley and Bryan, between what is represented in
st;<^yaft by the one and in demagogy' by the other.
The _ are men who are supporting Bryan for no
other reason than a desire to, defeat McKinley. Be
cause they object to the President personally or to
his policy upon some question great, or small, they
are opposed to him. The Democratic cry of old was:
"Anything to beat Grant," and now it is, "Anything
to beat McKinley."
The antagonism to the President is carried out with
a frankness that hardly attempts concealment. It will
be remembered that after the Kansas City p!atfo~m
was adopted David Bennett Hill of New York told
the convention that some of the platform could be
used in one State and other portions of it ill another.
"There is hardly a man." he said, "who cannot find
in the platform something he will be willing to vote
for." So it was openly announced that the campaign
is to be waged by such tactics. The tight is to be
against gold in one place, against trusts in another
place and against expansion in a third place, but
everywhere it is to be against McKinley.
Not long ago James K. McGuire of the Democratic
State Committee of New York was quoted as saying:
"There are always a grcnt many things in a national
platform that cannot be emphasised in a State cam
pcign. Xow we have decided on a plan by which the
speakers in this State will devote attention exclusively
to the issue of imperialism, and just let the rest of
the platform go. I icll you the issue of imperialism
::- the real thing. It is much more vital than the
fanciful ills of free silver. The composition of the
Senate prevents any interference with our financial
system for some years. But imperialism is at our
very doors. Imperialism is shooting down our son>
this very day. Free slver won't be heard of in this
campaign."
The trick has been quickly taken up and now we
have men who a few years ago clearly depicted the
cviis that would surely result from the election of
Biy:-n declaring; a willingness to accept him for the
pake of defeating McKinley. During the State cam
paign in Kentucky two years ago Henry Watterson
said: "Mr. William J. Bryan has come to Kentucky
and Kentuckians have taken his measure. He is a
boy orator, lie is a dishonest dodger. He is a daring
adventurer. lie is a rolitical faker. He is not of the
material of which the people of the United States
have ever made a President, nor has he even the ma
terial of which any party has ever before made a can
dklute." Such was the judgment two years r.go.
Sir.ce then Bryan has not changed, but now Mr. Wat
terson. who continues to be in favor of the gold
standard, and who is :i strong imperialist, is support
ing the artful dodger .mi^ political faker.
Tour years ago Bourke Cockran said: "The Ameri
can nation will never consent to substitute the re
public of Washington, of Jefferson and of Jackson for
the republic of an Altgeld, a Tillman or a Bryan." In
that same campaign Carl Schurz said: ''The mer:
apprehension of the possibilityof Mr. Bryan's election
and the consequent placing of our country upon a
tilvcr basis has already caused untold millions of our
securities to be thrown upon the market. And if
these arc the effects of a mere apprehension of a
possibility, what would be the effect of the event it
self? There is scarcely an imaginable limit to the de
struction certain to he wrought by the business dis
turbance that Mr. Bryan's election would cause." Yet
thc c e'men are now prating about imperialism and, fol
lowing the advice of Hill, are trying to get the silver
;s5t:e out of the campaign in New York.
The people are not going to be deceived in this
contest any more than in the time when the cry was
anything to beat Grant. They are aware that Brynn
lias not changed since 1896, except, perhaps, to ac
quire a little more cunning in his methods of can
vassing. He is still the prophet of calamity, a dis
turber of business, a foe of American industry and an
advocate of national dishonor. Nothing but a blind
partisanship can induce any citizen to support him in
opposition to a President whose administration has
been so" glorious for the republic and ?o prosperous
for the people as that of William McKinley.
planks in the rival platforms without perceiving that
the Republicans offer substantial benefits to all the
workers of the country, while Democracy offers noth
ing more than an office to be scrambled for by poli
ticians. On such a showing, which is fairly charac
teristic of the contending parties, there ought to be
no difficulty experienced by workingmen in making
up their minds how to vote, even were there no other
issue at stake than the one raised by the two labor
planks.

SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 3.-That the coy
otes arc becoming a pest In this county
was forcibly illustrated yesterday near
Tocaloma, when a band of them drove
live deer hound3 out of the Mazza Gulch.
John and Donald Mclsaacs, two promi
nent citizens of Nlcasio, with a pack of
five hounds were on a buck hunting ex
pedition along the ridges between there
and Tocaloma. Late In the afternoon the
dogs made a start and the hunters were
lucky enough to wound the buck. Ordi
narily, a crippled deer with five hounds
in pursuit is soon brought to bay. This
buck, however, laid his course across
several canyons and over the ridge into
what is known as the Mazza Gulch. The
hounds wero close and followed him into
the gulch.
The hunters made their way across
country to the gulch, luljy expecting to
find the dogs In possession of the deer.
They could h-?ar the hounds baying and
fighting near the creek bottom. When thÂ«
men came to the head of the gulch they
were met by several well-used-up dogs,
while down in the deep gulch the defiant
snarl of great packs of coyotes could be
heard. The coyotes had fought the five
hounds out of the canyon. The two hunt
ters were glad enough to get their dogs
back, and as night was setting in they
bent their way homeward and left the
deer to the coyotes. This is not the first
time that coyotes have run hounds out
of jrulches here this season. Judge Bernard
miller of Nlcasio had a somewhat simi
lar experience about a month ago. Tho
Nleasioltes are planning a grand coyote
hunt, as a measure of protection to deer
and fawns that fall" prey to the beasts.

J( the celebration of Admission day
has there been so much activity as
there is at this time. All the committees
are. as It were, putting on the finishing
touches to the several parts of the festi

work In all parts of the city building

of march and, from indications, by Fri
day evening sill Â¦will be-in readiness to re
ceive the visitors from the interior who,
it is expected, will commence arriving by
the various lints of transportation on the
following morning.
The grand marshal and the parade com
mittee were at work Sunday and yester
day assigning the many organizations
each to a proper place in line. The plan
is. however, subject to chance as it is
the desire of those who have the matter
5n charge to place each organization In its
proper place. There will te either thirty
three or thirty-live . divisions in the pa
rade and more than forty floats. A rule
adopted by the eommiuer is that there
shall be no advertising on the floats or in
the procession and the chief of floats and
his aids have been instructed to turn out
anything that may be in the line of pure
advertising.
One of the features of the parade will be

SCULLERS DRAW FOR
CHOICE OF POSITIONS
In 1TC9 a settlement was founded by
pit neers in the Watauga Vailey in the ex
treme eastern portion of what is now Ten
nessee. Hither as a permanent seuler in
the new land came Robertson in HTL He
had, as I have already suggested, many of
the qualities of greatness and a capacity
for command, lie is Justly described by
one writer as a supple and robust man
"whose blue eyes and the alert habit of
a hunter and whose native air of com
mand attracted notice wherever he went,
and perhaps the weightiest man of all
these trans-Alleghany pioneers." It was
under his leadership that the new com
munity was organized, with written arti
cles of agreement known as tne Articles,
of the Watauga Association. As the pil
grims on board the Mayflower, when they
tound themselves on the New England
shore and out of the jurisdiction 01 the
London Company, within whose territory
they had intended to settle, drew up tne
famous Mayflower compact, so these west
ern colonists In the new country beyond
the mountains entered Into a solemn con
vention for self-government. Meeting to
gether in a sort of primitive folkmote, the
settlers provided for the election of thir
teen Representatives, who in turn chose a
committee of five and intrusted them with
executive and judicial functions. The
scheme was simple and effective, but there
are few facts in American history more
deserving of careful attention than the
easy self-confider.ce with which these
backwoodsmen organized themselves Into
a body politic and entered upon the task
of orderly self-government. It is this ca
pacity for organization, this political In
stinct, which secured the American conti
nent for the Anglo-Saxon race. Among
there men none were learned and some
hpd almost no schooling. Robertson him
self having had even fewer opportunities
than the majority, had just been "learn
ing hln letters and to spell" under the
tutelage of his educated wife. But they

Robertson's services as a leader of west
ern settlement can hardly be overestimat
ed. A story of his career is a history of
the early life of eastern Tennessee. One
of- his first exploits was to go alone on
a long expedition to the Cherokee country
to persuade the Indians not to begin hos
tilities against the settlers. This deed re
quired great courage, but the masterful
spirit of the man. his utter freedom from
fear and a certain commanding presence
had their influence. He accomplished his
purpose and returned in safety. A few
years later he was present at the battle
of the Great Kanawha, where an army of
backwoodsmen overwhelmed the Indians
under the great Shawnee chieftain. Corn
stalk. This was one of the fiercest and
most bloody battles ever fought in the
West. He commanded the "Watauga fort
in 1776. when it was attacked by the Chero
keos. The Indiana in the attacking party
numbered over 300. Not more than forty
whltes were fit for active service. For
three weeks the siege continued, varied
by midnight attacks and daily assaults,
but the brave little garrison, alert and
watchful, under a leader of resolution, re
sourcefulness and energy, repulsed the
attacks until the savages retreated Only
three years after this Robertson and a
few companions moved farther westward
into the wilderness, founding, near what
was then known as French Lake on the
Cumberland, a little settlement which
grew into the dtv of Nashville.
In some ways the most interesting and
fascinating flpure in Southwestern history
Is John Sevier. A man of education and
with a certain native refinement, courte
ous, handsome, Â«trong. of charming mien,
bold to the point of absolute recklessness,
loving danger for denger's Â«ake, or seem
ingly courting it with a light-hearted en
thusiasm fÂ«r excitement, be was the most
famous Indian fighter In a region where
every man was perforce a woodsman. He
was "more brilliant and dashing than Rob
ertson, but had something of the rame
skill In commanding men and curbing tho
rougher spirits of the frontier. He was
one of the early settlers at the Watauga
and a member of the first committee of
thirteen in that assoclat'on. He .was sec
ond In command when the Cherokees at
tacked the settlement and valiantly aided
Robertson In the defense of the fort. He
was ope of the leaders at the battle of
Kings Mountain, where the hardy fron
tiersmen, armed with their clumsy flint
locks, mowed down the British and Tory
troops and showed what a terrible weapon
the long rifle could become In the hands
of unerring marksmen. Returning from
this great victory. Sevier led a band of
riflemen against the Cherokees and de
feated the red men in a series of conflicts.
Again and again In the course of the com
ing years the Indians were beaten back or
overwhelmed In their own country by this
masterful man. He was perhaps the most
successful Indian fighter on the border,
because his followers believed In him and
obeyed him as much as the restless woods-
X.
(Concluded.)
Even to mention all of Boone's advent
ures and hairbreadth escapes in an article
of this kind is impossible. He was pres
ent at the famous battle of the Blue
Licks, the most woeful defeat ever suf
fered by tho Western woodsmen. This
occurred in 17S2, near the end of the revo
lutionary war. The Indians and a party
of British rangers from Detroit had at
tacked a settlement known as Bryan's
Station, but after a serious conflict had
been repulsed and were in retreat. They
were pursued by a much smaller band of
pioneers. Contrary to the advice of Boone
and the cooler i.ea-s in the company, the
little band of whites, urged on by the
reckless bravado of some of their num
ber, crossed the Blue Licks and attacked
the savages on the farther side. Boone
commanded the left wing and did valiant
service; but the frontiersmen were soon
repulsed and driven back through the
stream. Seventy of them were killed and
others taken prisoners. Boone escaped ..y
dint of his customary agility and skill,
dashing through the savages, swimming
the river and making his way back with
unerring accuracy to t.ie settlement.
Boone lived to oe St> years of age, dying
In 1820. He lived to see tne great Western
forests wii.ch he nau traversed disappear
before the advancing- tnrongs of settiers;
he saw Kentucky, 'lennessee, Mississippi,
Alabama, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois ami
Louisiana enter the Union; he who was
almost the Urst white man from the East
ern colonies to penetrate the remote soli
tude of the interior lived to see that
region clotted with thriving cities and vil
lages and peopled by over a million .nhab
itants, witn such marvelous rapidity did
the American people extend tnemselved
over the Mississippi basin and turn thj
wilderness lrifj piowlarui. Ine ditlerence
between French colonization on tne one
hand and English and American coloniza
tion on the other is brought. out oy this
fact: The French, who had explored tne
Mississippi Vauey in the seventeenth cen
tury, hao. in the middle of the eighteenth
only a few thousand men west of the
mountains; Tennessee and Kentucky,
which were first settled Dy the English
just before tne beginning of the revolu
tion, were admitted into tne Union as
self-governing States belore the tnd ot
the century-
As Boone was the best example of a
daring, adventurous woodsman wno loveU
the soutudes of the furest anu toux keen
est pleasure in hunting, so James ilooerl
son and John Sevier can be called tne
best examples or a type of men wno won
distinction as leaders of men and found
ers of the new commonwealths that Jr.
the last century sprang into being in the
Mississippi Valley, .fror success m the.r
great undertakings tney nteaed courage,
wisdom, sound judgment, vigor, constancy
and hope; they needed 10 be tsKimui
woodsmen, for every step was taKen in
the presence of a watchful and dangerous
enemy; above all, they needed the master
lul qualities of leadership whicn enaoic
men to impress themselves on their ioi
lowers. There were an sorts of elements
to be dealt with in this task of Western
settlementâ the Indians, wno were for
years Dloodthirsty enemies of the pio
neers; the reckless, degenerate "poor
whites," many of them the offscouring 01
the colonies east of the mountains: the
better class of settlers â men of virile na
ture, sturdy, honest, energetic, but men
who were oiten instinctively averse to fol
lowing the lead of another because of
their own inherent strength and seif-con
ndence.
Sevier s career is connected with thÂ«
foundation of the would-be independent
State of Franklin, which was formed by
the frontiersmen in Tennessee, a territory
then legally a part of North Carolina. Tho
story of the little commonwealth and its
final downfall cannot be told here. Sevier
was for a time Governor of the self-con
stituted State. "When Tennessee was ad
mitted into the Union Sevier was its first
Governor. He was beyond question a fron
tier statesman as well as an Indian fight
er, a leader of men and possessed of a
marked capacity for organization. No
weak or dreamy idpalist could do the
forceful work cf the hordpr. Sevter was
bold, energetic and full of intense vitality
â a fit man to be the founder of the firat
commonwealth established beyond the
mountains, a commonwealth won against
fearful odds by thp bravery and patient
fortitude of the hardy pioneers who were
leading on the march of civilization. Such
deeds are too often parsed over unnoticed
by the writers of American history, as If
the salient fact in our history were not
the marvelous skill and energy with
which a continent has In the course of
hardly more than a century been turned
from barren wilderness into farmland and
peopled with millions of prosperous and
happy people. A. C. MLAUGHLIN*.

men could obey any one, because with
marvelous adroitness he adopted the tac
tics of the red men and with superior in
telligence beat them by their own meth
ods, and because he gathered Rbout him
the best and truest men of the frontier.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.â The Navy De

official report of Captain Wilde of the
battleship Oregon of the circumstances
attending the grounding of that ship in
the Gulf of Pechili last June and her suc

firm the department's previously express
ed conviction that the grounding was not
in any respect attributable to fault on the
part of Captain Wilde, who, in fact, ap
pears to have exercised extraordinary
precautions to guard against the acci
dent. Nor was any other officer to blame.
The repairs have been completed and the
Oregon arrived yesterday at Woosung,
where she is to form one of the interna

Facial IMspatch to The Call
In 1SS7 he moved to Wichita. Kans.. and
engaged in commercial pursuits. He
gained much re-putation as a public speak
er and u reformer in politics and in 1SS3
v.;:s the unsuccessful candidate, for the
l.ib^ral nomination as Secretary of State.
In 1S32 ho was nominateu and elected
Governor of Kansas by the Democrats
and Populists and was again nominated
in 1834 by the latter party, but as the
Democrats had a candidate of their own
E. N. Morrill. the Repub.Â»can candidate
was elected in the tidal wave that carried
the State for that party. After that time
Mr. Lewelling took but little active part
in politics.
Lorenzo D. Lewelling was born in Sa
lem. Henry County Iowa, December 21,
1S40. His father, who was a minister of
the Society of Friends, and his mother
died when he was quite young and he had
bis own way to make from the start. He
worked for the farmers and attended
school during the winter until he was lti
years old. when he started to work as a
laborer on a railroad. Then he went witn
the I'nited States quartermaster's depart
ment as a cattle driver in Tennessee. He
joined a bridge building corps at Chatta
nooga until he was mustered out in 1S65.
In that year he taught a negro school at
Mexico. Mo., and then attended a busi
ness college at Poughkeeprle. X. Y. Find
ing no opening in commercial life when
he left the college he drove u. team on the
Erie canal for a time and later worked
as a carpenter at Toledo, Ohio, and as a
section hand on the railroad. Returning
to Iowa he worked as a bridge builder
and soon after entered Whittior College,
where he studied and taught until he
graduated. He taught in the Iowa Re
form School aud was made assistant su
perintendent. In 1VT0 he resigned, went
to farming and also started the- Salem
Register. The same jrear he- married and
in 1S72 took charge of the girls' depart
ment of the State Reform henool. Where
he continued for fifteen years.
He took a leading part i:i the national
conference of charities and for some

Mr. Sweigard also indicated that the
train dispatcher Groves made some effort
to hold the train up before it reached
Souderton, but said that it was yet to be
learned whether it was because of his
neglect or bad wires due to a heavy fog
prevailed at the time that the train was
not stopped.
According to James Benner. flagman at
Sorderton station, the milk train passed
that station on time and followed the rule
of the company, which requires any train
coming after another within live minutes
to be .stopped, he placed a red flag between
the tracks. In three minutes the excur
sion train came thundering along with
.Davis at the throttle, and making forty
miles an hour. Davis made no effort to
Mop and waved Benner to one side. The
latter had only time to secure his flag
and spring out of danger as the train
swept by. Looking upward, he saw that
Botdler had a clear signal set. Beidler,
when questioned, said he had received no
orders to stop the train. This would seem
to conflict with a statement made by-
General Superintendent Sweigard that ail
agents must stop a train, orders or no
orders, if there is five minutes time or less
between them.

NEW TORK.Sept. 3.â Georgre Gould's
famous yacht Atlanta, converted
into an armed cruiser, or provided
with rapid-fire guns of the latest
pattern, will leave this port at an
early date bound upon a mission about
which the representatives of the Colom
bian republic, to which she belongs, main
tain secrecy. Information brought by
travelers returning from Central America
indicates that the I'nlted States of Colom
bia, having suppressed a recent rebellion
of unt'sually sanguinary character, is de
termined to call Venezuela to account for
permitting the rebels to organize there
and cross the line into Colombia.
The. Atlanta, noted for her speed, was
purchased under special instructions from
the Colombian Government on July 20.
Since that time the yacht, which was built
for Jay Gould, has been undergoing a
quiet transformation in the Erie Basin.
From a luxurious pleasure craft she has
been changed into a war vessel. Her
armair.ent consists of six machine puns
and a rapid-fire -4.7-lr.ch rifle mounted for
ward. The day of tho Atlanta's departure
and her destination are diplomatic secrets.
According to trustworthy advices from
Colombia there is a strong popular feeliiiK
ag-ainst Venezuela as the result "if the re
cent internal struggle. Charges are openly
made that Venezuela Instigated tho rebel
lion and gave comfort to the enemies ot
Colombia. It is asserted that at least 12u0
of the rebels crossed the line from Vene
zuela into Colombian territory and that in
Although the revolution in Colombia has
been put down the standing army, said to
number G000, is kept up, and there is no
talk of disbanding it.
All those incidents have combined to an-
Ker the Colombian Government and popu
lace against Venezuela. Besides heavy
money indemnity an apology and guaran
tee for tho future will probably be asked.
Venezuelans .say that these demands will
be refused and that if they are insisted
upon war will probably result between
the two countries. Representatives 01
both countries have recently purchased
arms and ammunition in large quantities
in this countrv. Colombia has just or
dered 12.000 new Remington rifles, tiring
small bullets, similar to the Spanish
Mauser. The guns arc light and carry
sword bayonets.
VenezuelH will also be asked to surren
der General Sarmiento and his followers,
together with two punboats captured in a
Venezuelan port. General Sarmiento and
members cf the crows of the two vessels
were thrown into prison in Caracas and
their t-hipn .confiscated, as the. rebellion
had been suppressed in Colombia. Those
enemies of Colombia arc. it is said, about
to bo set free by President Castro.
When Colombia is ready it is said that
shp will ask indemnity from Venezuela of
$5000 for each of the 500 soldiers killed, or
$2.5O0.oon in all. Additional claims may h<
made for property destroyed and also for
the cost of suppressing the rebels whom
Venezuela permitted to cross her border.

SESSION AT SARATOGA
CAI/T, BUREAU, WELLINGTON'
HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.
â Whether the Kentucky l^frisla
ture enacts a fair election law or
r. -t. the Republican National Com
rriiitro has determined upon a course that
will insure a fair count of the returns of
the election in November. The statement
has boon made within the past few days
r^y an official of the National Committee
that sufficient numbers of I'nited States
Deputy Marshals will be distributed over
-.he iS.ato at various polling places to
prevent any intimidation of voters and
to Bee that ballots are counted as they
a*-p r.ipt. Merr.bcrs of the committee re
port that the Republicans aro certain to
Â«-loct John \V. Yerks as Governor, and
thai if they can make the count fairly
'. he- Fiate will give its electoral vole to
President MrKinley.
Senator Joe C. S. Blarkbum. who ar
rived ht-re to-day, says ho has hocn aware i
of the jÂ»lan for some time, ar.d charao- :
terizes 't as a brazen auempt to steal the ]
electoral vote of Kentucky. The State j
being naturally Democratic, according to j
his v-ow. and the election law about to!
rÂ»Â» enacted being manifestly fair and im- j
partial, there can be no other Interpret*- 1
tion than that it is to he a cas.> of steal.
He af!-< rts thmX h*Â» has warned Democrats |
"f the desiena of the Republican commit- i
tee. ard that he will return to Kentucky
in .i few Â«lays in ord*r to be present at j
ihe opening <>f the campaign, so that the i
Democrats will be certain to take steps
to exploit thoroughly the danger impend
ing. According to Senator Blarkburn, the
Democrats of West Virginia. Maryland
end Missouri will have a similar condi
tion to face. He points to the fact that
v'or.frrossionaJ elections will be held inci
dentally with the great election which |
inakf? the plan of the Republican man- j
asen possible and feasible. The Demo- |
.Â¦ran; will resent and tight to the last j
riitch. be says, any attempt to steaJ the
? lection, and so far as Kentucky is con- j
< erned n<Â» one need fear the presence of i
United States Marshals on election day.!
as th<:r presence will bÂ«Â» fully shown up
before the Â«.th of November.
The official who made this statement
roparding Kentucky denies that the com
mittee will take similar precautions in
any uthcr State, unless it should appear
that <'onditions exist elsewhere which on
the face are hostile and inimicable to a
fair coiint of t/.Â« votes cast. Browbeat
ing and intimldatitn in any quarter will
l>f* resisted :*.r.d solely in the interest of
protection and fairness. Owing to the un
pettled conditions 'n the Blue Grass State.
it has been definitely settled that in order
to cnxe into ilieir own some one must be
\be\p with official authority to see that
the ballots are returned as cast.

Boers at St. Helena.
NEW YORK. Sept. 3.-The British
steamship Masconomo, which has just
arrived from South Africa, touched at
St. Helena for repairs. Captain Mann was
permitted to visit the Boer prisoners on
the island. He rode up the five-mile
winding road to the top of Rupert Hill,
in Deadwood Plain, where he found the
prison pen of General Cronje's 2000 men.
The Boer captives are confined within a
barbed-wire inclosure a quarter of a mile
square. Twelve feet from the fence on
all sides is a second trocha like the first.
It is death for a Boer private to cross
the line of the inner pen. One Boer was
shot by a sentinel for doing this. The
British soldier was then tried and ac
quitted by a court-martial.
"While the British soldiers sleep 'thir
teen men in a tent." said Captain Mann,
"the Boers sleep only ten men in a tent.
In order to afford them all the room pos
sible the British have allowed the Boers
to cut bamboos for shack?. These bam
boo frames the Boers have ingeniously
covered with canvas and with slabs of
tin. The tin they obtained in a curious
way. There were on the island a great
many parailine cans, which the Boers
carefully flattened out for tin sides and
roofs to their shacks.
Prisoners Well Treated.
Some of the prisoners aro permitted to
work for the farmers on the island, and
therehy earn a little money. There were
many men 70 years old, and just as many
others 15. 16 and 17.
"The officers with whom I conversed
spoke both Dutch and English. The pri
vates seemed rather a stupid lot. They
have the same fare as the British soldiers.
1 conversed with Colonel Schiel. the Ger
man officer who fought with the Boers.
He was very cantankerous still.
"Commandant Roose, the Boer officer
who captured Winston Churchill, told me
that he thought the game was up and
his people ought to stop fighting. The
Boer officers are allowed to do pretty
much as thev please and their names are
posted at the St. Helena Club. The Brit
ish officers entertain them at afternoon
teas and General Cronje is practically the
steady guest of the Governor.
"A cable now runs to the island from
South Africa and the bulletins from the
seat of war are frequently struck off and
sold to the prisoners at a penny apiece.
A Dutch ship anchored while I was there,
but was requested to leave and did so.
The British were afraid some of the Boers
would get away on their cousins' ship."

Â»
WASHINGTON. Sept. 3.-The Depart
ment of Agriculture has issued a report
on investigations of the big trees of Cal
ifornia, that brings out some interesting
new conclusions. It shows that the di
mensions of the larger trees are unequal
ed; that their age makes them the oldest
living things. They are described by the
report as "the grandest, -largest, oldest
and most majestically graceful of trees,
and the scarcest of known trees, with the
extreme scientific value of being the best
living representatives of a former geo
logical age."
The report says theubark of the big trees
often is two feet thick and almost non
combustible. "The oldest specimens fell
ed," it says, "are still sounn at heart and
fungus is an enemy unknown to it. let
the big trees apparently have not in
creaseit their range since the glacial
epoch. They have only just managed to
hold their own on the little slip of country
where the climate is locally favorable."
Continuing the report says: "The only
grove now thoroughly safe from destruc
tion is the Mariposa; and this is far from
being the most interesting. Most of the
other groves are either in process of or in
danger of being logged. The very finest
of all, the Calavcras grove, with the big
gest and tallest trees, the most uncon
taminated .surroundings and practically
all tho literary and scientific associations
of the species could with it be purchased
easily ot a lumberman who came into full
possession on April 1. The Sequoia and
General Grant national parks, which are
supposed to embrace and to give secur
ity to a large part of the big trees, are
oaten into by a sawmill each, and the pri
vate timber claims amount to a total
of 1173 acres.
"The rtst of the scanty patches of big
trees in Calaveras, Tuolumne and Tulare
counties are now disappearing â by the
ax. In brief, the majority of big trees of
California are owned by people who have
every right and in many cases every in
tention to cut them into lumber."
The most recent investigations, accord
ing to the report, confirms the estimates
that thtse giant trees have probably lived
5U00 years or more, though few of even the
larger trees are more than half as old.
The average rate of growth is estimated
at one inch of diameter for every twelve
years. The report also corroborates the
statements of one authority who pays that
one tree on which he counted 4000 rings
was undoubtedly in its prime, "swaying
in the Sierra winds when Christ walked
the earth,"
The report states among other things,
as the result of official Investigations:
"The only place in the world where the
big trees exists is in ten isolated groves
on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains. The species, however, repre
sent a surviving prehistorical genus of
trees once growing widely over the globe.
The southern groves show some reproduc
tion, through which there is hope of per
petuating these groves. In the northern
groves the species hardly holds its own.

DENVER. Sept. 3.â A special to the
Republican from Glenwood Springs, Colo.,
says: According to all reports, the

minds of the agents that their work, will
be ratified by their superior officers.
The scope of the organization covers all
passenger traffic west of the Missouri
River destined to California points only.
The business to the northern coast points
i.i no L , coy ered by the association,
although it is believed that the railroad
lines leading to the north will later come
Into the organization. None of these lines
were represented at this meeting.
The question of the handling of troops
will remain in statu quo for a time at
least. No definite conclusion was arrived
at concerning this point, which has occu
pied more time and attention than all tha
others combined. The leaving of the mili
tary matter in this shape is due to trie
continued and persistent opposition of th"
Santa Fe.
The next meeting of the passenger
agents will be held in Chicago some time
during October. Meanwhile the execu
tive committee, consisting of K. C
Cormick of the Southern Pacific, E L
Iximax of the Union Pacific. John Sebas
tian of the Rock Island. Chairman Mc-
I.eod and Secretary T. Thompson of the
estern Passenger Association will have
charge of such work as can be done. The
association will not become operative
until after the meeting in October. The
association will be an independent one.

at a time, wero confined ln large Iron

how hungry they were, never gnawed the
matches, but the rats set several fires, the

MURDERER BUTTS
DIES IN FOLSOM
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, Sept. 3.
Official notice was received at police
headquarters to-day of the death of
"Pacing Billy" Butts at Folsom prison
on August 25. For nearly seven year3
William Butts had languished in prison,
paying the penalty for a wild night In this
city when he ran amuck on the principal
streets and shot down two of Oakland's
citizens.
Previous to this tragedy Butts had been
several times arrested for minor offenses
and once for the burglary of the Colum
bia boathouse. On the evening of October
1, 1S03. Butts was met at the corner of
Broadway and Seventh streets by William
Green, an employe of the Oakland Con
tracting Company, who greeted him with
the remark, â¢â¢Hello, Butts, when did you
get out of jail? "
Butts vas under the Influence of liquor
and morphine and was in an ugly frame
of mind. He drew a revolver and shot
Green, inflicting a mortal wound. M'lth
the smoking weapon in his hand, he ran
down Broadway to Sixth street. There
W. E. Beeny, a motorman on the Pied
mont road, was standing. Butts, think
ing he was about to be stopped by the
man. shot and killed him. By this time
Chief of Police Hodgkins, Patrolman
Scanlan and William J. MofTit had joined
in pursuit of the murderous runner. They
tired fourteen shots at him and he twice
emptied his pistol in return. Finally
liutta fell, riddled with bullets.
For months Butts lingered in the Coun
ty Jail, a wreck from the effects of his
numerous wounds. After nearly two years
had passed he had sufficiently recovered
to be brought into court. He was con
victed of manslaughter and sent to San
Qt:entln on October 9, lSf6. In the peni
tentiary Butts still suffered from un
healed wounds. On the 11th of last month
he was transferred to Folsom prison in
the "hope that the change would prolong
hi* life. He lived but two weeks after
his removal.
THINKS THE FILIPINOS
CAN GOVERN THEMSELVES
Rev. Father McQuaide Pays a Tribute
to the Morality and Intelli
gence of the People.
Rev. Father McQuaide entertained a
large gathering of members and friends of
Ignatian Council No. 35, Young Men's In
stitute, last evening in the rooms of that
organization with an Informal talk on the
Philippines.
The speaker paid a high tribute to the
Filipinos. Hi snowed how groundless was
the statement that they are semi-barbar
ians/ irreligious. â¢ superstitious, dishonest
and lazy. He told of their intelligence,
strong belief In the faith, piety, great mu
sical ability, sobriety, simplicity and hon
esty. He also told of the love that filled
the" household, where the wife and mother
held queenly sway, and how the children
were taught to revere their parents. In
closing his highly entertaining talk he
said:
"Tho Filipinos are a very shrewd nnd
capable people and I am not inconsistent
when I say that people who have their
faith, piety, morality, education and
cleanliness can be taught to govern them
selves. If I were asked whether it would
pay this country to keep the Philippines
I would unhesitatingly say no. I flrmlv
believe that our flag should remain in the
islands, but let It remain as a protectorate
over a self-governing people."
R. B. Kay sang a barytone solo; J. C.
O'Donnell rendered some comic selections
and James A. Donohue and "Billy" Hinea
also rendered some topical songs. Hynd's
orchestra played many selections and L.
E. Mahon. grand president of the Young
Men's Institute, said some pleasing things
about Ignatian Council Xo. 35 and the
order at large.
Railroad Foreman Injured.
OAKLAND, Sept. Câ George Jesmlng
sion. a section foreman employed by the
Southern Pacific Company, was struck by
a narrow-gauge engine at Thirteenth anil
Webster streets at 9 o'clock this morning
while overseeing pome track repairs. Jes
mingslon was thrown a dozen feet and
violently hurled to the ground. He was
removed to the Receiving Hospital. There
were no serious external injuries, but the
railroad man suffered severely from the
shock.
Tivoli.
Verdi's tragic opera "Ernanl" was pre
sented at the Tivoli Opera-house last
THE Alcazar is the nearest approach
we have to a people's theater; tho
price of admission is low, the mount-
Ing of plays suJIicient and the acting
certainly not two-thirds worse than that
at theaters which charge three times the
price. Every attempt, then, made at such
a theater to present a worthy play should
meet with special encouragement from
those who would like to see the drama
take hold of the hearts and minds of those
who toil that others may be rich.
Such an attempt was made last night,
when the Alcazar management presented
Henry Arthur Jones' drama "The Mas
querailers"âa difficult play even with
plenty of time for preparation. Yet with
only a week's rehearsal the performance,
when judged by a relative and not by an
absolute standard, was distinctly credita
ble. In Howard Hall this theater has se
cured the best leading man it has haa
since, the time of Mr. Qrmonde.
Air. Hall haa a good presence, a graceful
figure, an excellent voice and above allâ
repose. Many who remember his efficient
work when he was here with Mr. Man tell
two years ugo, will be glad to welcome
1:1m as a permanent addition to our small
Mock cf good actors. Looming largo
moreover in this small stock one must not
forget the ever-satisfactory Montalneâ a
little throat-sore from his strenuous ex
ertions in "The Only "Way," but always
conscientious and capable. Mr. Howard
Scott linds difficulty in subduing his
natural amiability to the villainous dye of
Sir Brice Skene, but a few more exercises
nt temper-cultivation wjll doubtless re
duce, him to the wicked consistency of
the part.
As to the ladies, Miss Blayney has a
Dresden- shepherdess style of beauty that
fits the character of Lady Clarice to per
fection. She has much looking and little
talking to do. so everything there, as Mr.
Gilbr-rt would say, is right as right can bo.
Miss Atwood, as Helen Larondle, ap
peared to much better advantage than in
anything I have yet seen her. As to Miss
Dorr in the heroine's part, I confess I
am badly handicapped In passing judg
ment by my remembrance of Miss Viola
Allen's rendition. That was perfection:
this is not, though it is good in parts. It
falls, I think, in the lighter scenes of the
first act and improves steadily as the
situations develop more and more seri
ously until in the last act it Is (for the
first time) quite convincing.
The play is too well known to need an
alysis or comment further than the call
ing attention to the power and the poetry
of this same last act â the most beautiful
act, I think, that Mr. Jones has ever
written, L. DU PONT SYLE.
Clay Clemenfand L. R. Stockwell. made
their first appearance as joint stars in

The play is their own adaptation of "No

and Florence, and lost nothing fn its pre

sisted by a capable company. Mr
Clement, in the character of Jules Oben
reizcr, won additional plaudits and dem
onstrated that he is equal to the exacting
requirements of a diflicult part. Stock
well, as Joey Ladle, was amusing, as h*
always is, and his philosophical disserta
tions were quaintly humorous. Mrs
Clement was seen to advantage as Mar
guerite, a character essentially distinct
from those hitherto played by "her. She

111S Broadway. Sept. 3.
Whilo lying seriously ill in bed at her
residence, 121 Lake street, Mrs. Alfred von
der Ropp, wife of the superintendent of
the Selby Smelting Works, was rescued
from the burning house this afternoon by
Policeman John Morrison. Mrs. von der
Ropp was alone In the big mansion, ex
cept for two women servants, who be
came demoralized by frrght as soon as
they discovered the place was aflre.
The quick-witted policeman was one of
the first on the scene. The tire, which
caught on the roof, worked into the raft
ers and tilled the dwelling with smoke so
quickly that it seemod as li the entire
building was to succumb.
Mrs. von der Ropp was occupying a
second-flix)r room, almost directly be
neath the spot where the flames broke
out. The servant girls rushed from me
house screaming for assistance. Police
man Morrison rushed through the smoka
and quickly got the sick woman bundled
into blankets and carried her through the
smoky rooms and hallways safely into
the street. The policeman bore his
charge to the nearby residence of friends.
The shock to I ra. von der Ropp was se
rious, and physicians were called to at
tend her.
The tire was first !>een by neighbors, who
telephoned an alarm, which was answered
by a chemical engine. A short time aft
erward a call alarm summoned more ap
paratus. The firemen got the blazn under
control after much damage had been
done to the roof and upper portion of thÂ«Â»
residence. The blaze was caused by
sparks from a chimney failing In the
crevices of the dry roof.

presented themselves at the Presidio yes
terday and submitted their horses to the
Government test with a view toward hav

and his force of broncho busters walked,
trotted and galloped the animals, exam
ined their teeth and measured them and
managed to secure fifteen or twenty that
came up to requirements. Some of tho
horses were wicked and taxed the riding
abilities of the men. A large crowd stood
around and applauded the riders for their
fine horsemanship. Some of the men were
unseated, but no one was hurt.

Who Are Coming.
Chief Sullivan is also making extensive
arrangements for the celebration. During
the day of the big parade next Monday all
the special officers will be in uniform to
do police duty, as the entire force will be
on the streets on the line of parade. They
will also be required on the more frequent
ed streets to preserve order I after the
parade is over. A squad of men will be
stationed nt the foot of Market street to
divert traffic east and west and away from
Maiket street, so as not to Interfere with
the parade. The entire line of march will
be roped with wire rope and spectators
will have to keep on the sidewalks. This
rule will be rigidly enforced. N'o special
instructions will bÂ« issued policemen re
garding the making of arrests in cases
of men under the influence of drink', and
where there nre, rows on the streets due
to en overindulgence in liquor. The
policemen will be guided by their own
judgment in such cases.
"Commencing to-morrow," said Captain
Seymour yesterday, "detectives will meet
all the incoming trains and- steamers and
they will arrest every crook that â¢ they
recognize. , Those arrested will be detain
ed until after the celebration. 1 propose,
as far as 1 am able, to protect the unwary
from being fleeced by these sharks. It is
possible that we may not be abie to gather
them all in, but most of them are Known
to us and it will be impossible for them
to escape. We are following the same
course that was adopted at the time the
Christian Kndeavorers were here."
Bunko men, pickpockets and others of
that ilk who come here with the Intention
of reaping a harvest during the Admission

Captain Seymour issued Instructions yes
terday to his detectives to arrest all bunko
men and pickpockets and they will be kept
In the city prison until the celebration is
over. Detectives Ryan and Dillon arrested
two well-known bunko men yesterday â

"Give me a glass of whisky, for I ain't
got long to live. My pipes are dry and I
want just one more drink before I close
my eyes never to open them again."
Thus spoke James Sheperdson, an ex
member of the Tennessee Regiment, as
he staggered Into a saloon at 434 Pine
street yesterday morning. The bar
tender, suspecting that he had taken poi
son, gave him a drink of whisky and then
had him sent to the Receiving Hospital.
After reaching that institution he re
lapsed into unconsciousness and seemed
to be in a dying condition. As there was |
nothing found on him to indicate who he f
was, the surgeons at once notiiied Cap- I
tain of Detectives Seymour. . He detailed
Detectives Dinan and Wren en the case,
and after considerable trouble they
learned the patient's name through a
comrade who had served with him in the j
Tennessee Regiment. According to the i
story, Sheperdson became disgusted with j
the "life of a soldier and managed to se
cure his discharge through the efforts of
some influential friends. On being chided i
by his comrades for leaving the regiment
he became despondent and determined to i
take his life. Before entering the Pine
street saloon he swallowed fifteen grains
of morphine, which he had purchased
with money given him by a friend. As j
the poison began to take effect he walked
into the saloon, determined to take a fare
well drink of whisky, as he thought.
Last night the surgeons at the hospital
expressed the opinion that he would live.

V. C. Clarke, an employe of the Jour

is wanted here also on a charge of de
frauding an innkeeper. He used to visit

Several more missionaries, refugees
from all points of China, arrived In this
city yesterday on the steamer Doric. C.
A. Solquist and Mrs. Solquist. from West
ern China, took apartments at the Occi
dental, as did A. B. Snow and wife of
Singapore and H. !â Corbin of Nlngpo.
All are refugees. They experienced some
trying moments while en route to the
coast from the interior. They were ex
ceedingly fatigued last night and declined
to talk at length about their adventures
They condemn the imperial troops, who
they declare are little better in point of
armament or discipline than the savage
Boxer hordes.
K. S. Stokke and wife and Miss Pet
erson, missionaries, also arrived on the
steamer. They are representatives of the
American Mission of the Norwegian Lu
theran church of Minneapolis, Minn . and
were stationed at Running Fu. in the
province of Hunan. They had to travel
210 miles to reach Hankow and had
rather a stormy time. On July 13 thev
were driven out by rioters, who looted
the mission.
"What the Chinese need just now is
bullets instead of preaching," said the
Rev. Mr.- Stokke. "This is rather a hard

truth and should therefore be spoken

OEDESTRTAXS on Van Ness avenue
about 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon
|J were electrified by the sight of a
runaway span of horses that
dashed up and down the grades with the
rpeed of a "wild" locomotive. Seated in
the buggy were Dr. C. F. Buckley of thin
city and Charles W. Haskell of Denver,
his brother-in-law. When the frightened
team reached the corner of Van Ness
avenue and Pine street, from where the
grade is down hill all the way to Market
etreet, Haskell leaped from the* buggy and
struck with terrific force on the i>itumin
ize<3 pavement. His bones snapped like
pipestems. One fragment of hone pro
truded through the fle?h of his left leg
and from the wound the blood flowed in
a. torrent. Dr. Buckley, who was driving.
remained in his seat until the maddened
animals fell on Market street and threw
him stunned and bleeding on the sidewalk.
The hordes became frightened and
started !â¢> run away on Van Xe=s avenue
near Union street. With a nerve and cooj
3i*>ss wonderful in a. man of his advanced
year? Dr. Buckley sat in his peat, hold
ing the linos firmly in his hands. Ho
made a striking nguro as the team dashed
madly onward. His eyes were steadily
fixed ahead and he evidently ha<1 it in
mind to go to Market street, for he made
ro attempt to hold in the horses or tn turn
*hem asid* 1 . Hi* white hair was Mowing
in the wind. There was nothing in hiÂ«
manner to indicate that he was in the
ieast perturbed. Warning pbout? were
raised by the bystanders, who realized
that Market stroet at that hour was
Traversed every minute by heavily laden
Â« arf ajift by scores of teams and* bicycle
rider?. There Â¦were half a dozen narrow
escnpos along the avenue, one an old lady.
The preat peril; however, was to be en
countered on Market street. When that
thoroughfare was reached there were
cars moving in both directions and not
far off. On the west-bound car were pos
sibly one hundred passengers, lilling tho
sf-ats and clinging to the platforms.
Dr. Buckley then gave an exhibition of
horsemanship that was worthy of his
nerve. Sheering the horses westward he
>vent over to the_ south side of ilarkvt
street and he might have been able to
have carried out his plan, which evidently
was to lot the horses run out Market
Ptrtet and up the hills until they were
tired enough to come to a stand, i.ut un
fortunately an east-bound car happened
along inopportunely and rendered impos
sible- the consummation of the plan. The
maddened horses were forced over onto
the sidewalk on the south side of the
street, where one of them fell.
Thp brave physician was thrown from
his carriage and struck on the Btonc side
walk upon his head. The horses tried to
go on. but were held by bystanders. Dr.
I3ucklc# was taken up unconscious, and
was carried into Harrington's drugstore.
There he presently revived. His first ques
tion was, "Why. where am I?" Then
he seemed to realize. An ambulance took
him to the MeXutt Hospital on Sutter
street. Mr. Haskell had been taken there
earlier.
Mr. Haskell was unconscious and an ex
amination showed that there was a com
pound fracture of the hones of the left
leg just above the ankle. Dr. Buckley's
injuries did not appear to be serious. His
face was badly lacerated and he had
many bruisps. N'o bones were broken and
he did not appear to have been injured in
ternally. He was put to bed. Later Has
kc-H was operated on.

some lad about 12 years old wanted
to go to Manila with Battery C, and in
order to get there had stowed himself
away. The members of the battery were
with him to a man, but even the most in
genious of their devices failed to gain him
a passage. He was looked up in the wait

all the windows were broken In an at

at rescue were frustrated.
The boy is John Woefling. and he cJ.me

The friendly test case be^un by the At
torney General and tho Secretary ot* Stato
to determine which of two constitutional
amendments relating to the reorganiza
tion of the appellate judiciary of tna
State should be submitted to the voters
has developed some interesting points. A
number of the brightest lawyers in. th'3
State have been endeavoring to unraval
the tangle and all disagree.
At its regular session id 1>DO tho Legis
lature proposed an amendment to the con
stitution looking to a. reorganization of
the appellate judiciary of this State wilii
a view to relieving the congested condi
tion of the calendar of th<> Supremo Courc.
At the extra session ot 10m> the legisla
ture again proposed an amendment look-
Ing to the reorganization of thÂ« appclhua
judiciary of this State, which proposed
amendment was, excepting as to certain
minor matters, substantially the same ad
the amendment proposed at the regular
session in relation to the same subject.
When the Secretary of State came to nave
these proposed amendments printed an.i
sent out to the various County Clerks. a>
required to do by- law. he ran across tht>
two amendments that Memed to be very
much alike, and he thereupon wrote io
the Attorney General asking if he should
certify both amendments, or if only one,
which one. The Attorney General replied
that in his opinion the LeRislature ha-t
a. lepal right to propose constitutional
amendments at the extra session, and that
the amendment then proposed in rotation
to the appellate judiciary displaced arid
superseded the amendment proposed in
that behalf at the regular session and
that, therefore, the Secretary of Stato
should certify tho amendment proposed
at the extra session, but not the one pro
posed at the regular session.
The matter be Ins of such jrrave Im
portance, the Attorney General and tho
Secretary of State concluded that it would
bo wise to secim 1 a decision from tho Su
preme Court upon the question as to which
one of these amendments should be sub
mitted to the people.- A friendly suit was
thereupon bepun and is now pendinpr in
the Supreme Ccurt. The Attorney Gen
eral, on behalf of the people, and ilessrs.
Riordan & Lande, on behalf of tho Secre

that the cause might be submitted .or de

friends of the court, in which thery :ir-

constitutional amendments have hereto
fore been submitted, was repealed by an
act passed by the Legislature at the reg
ular session in XSSO, arid that there ia row
no law under which constitutional amend
ments can be submitted to a vote of tho
people. In reply to the brief of Messrs.
Anderson & Anderson the Attorney Men
eral has just completed a brief In which,
he calls the attention of the court to tho
fact that the journals of the Senate and
Assembly of the session of 1SJS show that
the repealinp act referred to by Messrs.
Anderson & Anderson is inva'.i 1. for the
reason that the bill signed by the Gov

TEST CASE AS
TO AMENDMENTS
IN ORGANIC LAW
Police Officer John Dougherty, bailiff in
Judge Fritz's court, is the man who, it 13
alleged, forced Joseph Deane, charged
with grand larceny, to give him $2 50 for
taking him to the Hibernia Bank to draw
his money, as told in yesterday's Call.
As soon as Chief of Police Sullivan
learned of the outrage he sent for Deane,
who unhesitatingly told the story of how
he had been arrested for grand larceny
and taken into Judge .Fritz's court for
examination; how Dougherty, the bailiff,
and a police court practitioner named
Glover induced him to go to the Dank,
where he had $208 on deposit, with them
for the purpose of "shaking" him down,
as he expressed it. After drawing tho
money ho claimed he was forced to givo
Glover &0 and the policeman $2 50, the
latter amount being for "protection."
Both' Glover and Dougherty, so Deane
says, represented that they could â¢tix"
Judge Fritz and unless the amount they
asked for was t'ortlicoming he would
be "railroaded" to San Quentin.
Chief Sullivan at once *ent for Glover
and Dougherty and asked them ll thev
knew Deane. Glover replied that he had
been engaged to defend him. but denied
that he had forced him to give up any
money. After carefully scrutinizing
Dougherty the prisoner declared that he
was the man who accompanied him to the
bank and under the pretext that he haJ
a "pull" with Judge Fritz demanded ?2 30
as his fee.
Glover and the policeman vehemently
denied that Deane was forced to give up
to them. Glover, who was under the in
fluence of liquor, became so boisterous in
his denunciation of I_>eane that Captain
Seymour had to order him out of tha
office.
Dougherty will be cited to appear before
the commissioners at their next meeting
to show cause why he should. not be dis
missed from the force. It is* understood
that proceedings will also be commenced
against Glover to have him disbarred.

YOUNG DENTAL
STUDENTS IN
NEW QUARTERS
Splendid College Buildings
Formally Opened by Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler.
University President Welcomes the
Students and Warmly Praises
the' Big State Institution
of Learning.

Â¦ The commodious new dental buildings
of the University of California were for- '
inally opened yesterday afternoon when
Benjamin I. Wheeler, president of the uni
versity, warmly welcomed the incoming
stutients and congratulated them upon
having such a desirable home of learning.
The lecture-room was well filled with
students, their relatives and friends and
before the exercises began the boys found
considerable amusement in giving ihe col
lege yell and a few "tigers" for President
Wheeler and Dean Goddard. The occasion
marked the opening of the nineteenth ses
?> â¢? lhe collo &e and as a preface to
President Wheeler's address Dr. Goddard
took occasion to thank the State legisla
ture for appropriating: the money for the
new buildings and Incidentally he alluued
to ttje fact that no funds had been sup
pllrrt-*T)y the. State for equipping the col
lege; the lixtures having been purchased,
through the means: of a loan, for which
the members of the l faculty gave personal
security.
The dental department of the University
ol California was started in 1SD1. At first
a course in the department covered two
terms of five months each. It was tho
lirst dental college in the United States
to adopt a course of nine months a year
instead of three. It was the third dental
college in the Union to require prelimin
ary examinations for admission and also
the third college to substitute a three
years' course for a two years" course.
President Wheeler was warmly received
and gave an earnest, practical talk, last
ing nearly an hour. He believed that this
section of the West is destined to become
a great center for the imparting of knowl
edge in medical science.
f "The medical work," said Dr. Wheeler,
"must needs be done in the large cities.
Experience has demonstrated that tho
place for a medical school is in a big
city. This assemblage here to-day means
that a public institution goe3 into full
operation, an institution that is a .con
stituent part of the University of Cali
fornia. It is no small honor to be con
nected -with the University of California.
This year it will have passed the 3H)0
mark in the number of its stude'nto.
Young men have come in upon us this
year like an avalanche. In 1K9S the out
side students represented only 3 per cent
of the total enrollment. This year tho
outside registration is over 8 per cent."
The president then went on to tell what
the university has accomplished for San
Francisco and the State of California, iic
noted a marked increase in the number ot
students who come from Southern Cali
fornia, while tho enrollment of students
coming from around the bay shows a de
crease from 25 to IB per cent. This means
that tho student list is becoming more
general. It is losing its provincial char
acter. Eight years ago it was a San
Francisco institution: now it ia a State
and national institution. It's a great, j
proud, noble body engaged in spreading
knowledge among young men:
"I was told a short time ago," said Dr.
Wheeler, "that the best men at Johns
Hopkins came from the California Uni
versity. As none but college graduates
are accepted there I consider this a very
high indorsement."
President' Wheeler then took up th-?
question of discipline, paying in part:
1 "The world wants disciplined men. It
don't want men who do only as they like
to do. It wants men who do as others
like them to do. Men who reckon upon
the sense of obligation and who know
what it is to say 'that's my duty' ara
the ones most wanted to-day. There is
no call for free lances or the man with
moral laxity. The call is for disciplined,
trained men who know the difference be
tween right and wrong and observe it."
Tho president concluded by referring to
the high standing of the graduates of tb'j
University of California and of the vari
ous positions of trust and responsibility
they have assumed since leaving ihe in
stitution. The university, he said, is what
Its graduates make it.
