ATLANTA. Sept. 28. â Charges have been
filed with the Prison Commission of Geor
gia by Solicitor J. W. Edmundson of
Brooks County against the McRee convict
camp managers of Lowndes County, this
State, in the form of affidavits from prom
inent citizens, to the effect that tho Mc-
Ree brothers have kidnaped Innocent men
and women and made them work under
armed guards for an indefinite period. It
is charged that one practice of the McRee
camp has been to employV'trappers'* to
arrest innocent negroes passing through
the country and without the form of trial
to Imprison them and put them to work.
The charges filed by Solicitor Edmund
son contain the following: r "Fanny Jack
son, 8 or 10 years ago. went to the eamr>
to visit her husband, who was kept there
as a convict. When she went to leave the
camp she was arrested and forced to
work, chained with the men. watched by
the guards and frequently whipped. She
had a young child with her and finally
Will McRee whipped her terribly to make
her bind the child to the camp In order
that it might grow up a convict."
Other affl.da.vlts charge that they were
arrested and detained similarly without a
criminal charge being proved against
them.
Several white citir-ens of the vicinity al
lege that the affidavits of the negroes are
accurate as to statements made In them.

he had been struck by the burglar's pistol,
they surmised that something was wrong
and on hearing the rapping on -the vault

Governor Roosevelt spoke at the Armory
Hall, which was filled. There were many
Republicans in the audience, but 'there
were also apparently many Democrats,
who made themselves manifest by noisy
demonstrations. Governor Roosevelt said:
They had Just presented him with a bÂ»g
chunk of sllvanite which had been baked.
These fellows, all in khaki campaign uni
forms, plied out of the car past the Gov
ernor and formed In line beside the Min
nesota. The Governor, because he did
not want to lose a minute of the time al
lotted to Victor, twenty-flve minutes, said
he would not wait for the escort to form.
Victor is a town where McKinley polled
four votes In '&. and where an angry com
mittee went through the town with a
bucket of tar and a feather pillow trying
to find out who cast those four votes.
There were no flowers at Victor. But
the people who came to the station to
meet the train seemed to be altogether
glad to see the distinguished party who
had come to exhort them. There waa a
big cheer when the train stopped and an
other when Roosevelt appeared, and still
another greeted Senator Lodge, who has
made himself tremendously popular with
the people of Colorado. At the head of
the train was the Cripple Creek and Vic
tor Marching Club and a brass ban-J
which had gone to Colorado Springs to
meet Governor Roosevelt and escort him
Into the hills of gold. Some of them were
on the car Minnesota with the Governor
when the train stopped In the Victor sta
tion.
The very same thing happened to-day at
Gillette, which is on the edge of the Crip
ple Creek district. Even those who had
been prophesying evil things at Victor and
Cripple Creek were disarmed by the cheer
ful aspect of things In Gillette. To be sure
a drunken man on the outside of the
crowd yelled "Bryan! Bryan!" and there
was a sympathetic cheer from a number
of men and women, but in the face of the
crowd of the hundreds who answered the
shout by three tremendous cheers for Mc-
Klnley, the Incident seemed ridiculous.
The air has bee'n full of Â»>>uch stories ever
since the Governor reachetf Montana. He
was told to beware of rocks there, and
was pelted with flowers at the very places
which had been pointed out as the most
dangerous.
The train departed from Victor amid
a shower of stones with the Governor of
New York standing on the back platform,
despite the efforts of some of his East
ern friends to get him Into the car. He
courteously acknowledged every McKln
ley mar. that came from Victor on the
outside of the circle of riotous assailants
who had fought way through to the car.
The riotors threatened to follow the train
to Cripple Creek, and make the Governor
sorry h^ever came Into Colorado. Sixty
special policemen were waiting for them
at Cripple Creek, and the Volunteer Law
and Order Association organized on the
tra& by Sherman Bell, who was once
Deputy United States Marshal here, sur
rounded Roosevelt as he stepped from the
train. The mob looked them over, con
tented itself with noise and that a long
way off.
Taken all In all the scenes here and at
Victor to-day were the most disgraceful
ever witnessed in the Centennial State,
and are deplored by every respectable citi
zen, regardless of party. Warnings of
Colorado pollticans and railroad men that
It was not without the bounds of possibil
ity that there might be rough conduct
when Roosevelt reached the Cripple Creek
region was laughed at by the people who
have been through the trip with him.
The Governor himself laughed at them.
Miss Davis, niece of Senator Lodge, and
Mrs. Kemp were in the hall with Roose
velt when the first disturbance took place.
They were not out of the door two min
utes when the mob that assaulted Roose
velt marched in. It was due to the stren
uous efforts of Lieutenant Sherman Bell
of the First Volunteer Cavalry and of
General Irving Hall that no bones were
broken. They broke Into the center of
the crowd and kept the campaign organi
zations which were surrounding Roosevelt
from coming Into direct contact with the
rioters until Just before Roosevelt reached
the train. Then the clubbing and throw
ing cf stones began and bloody heads and
bruises were many and frequent "in the
next few seconds. The man who struck
the Governor was ridden down and tram
pled on by one of the mounted escort.
His friends carried him away before the
police, who stayed away until the last
moment, could find out who he "was.
CRIPPLE CREEK. Colo.. Sept. 26.-The
friends of Bryan in Victor, In the Cripple
Creek region, met Roosevelt's campaign
for McKlnley this afternoon with sticks,
stones. and vile epithets. Roosevelt was
struck with a club, but not hurt. The
riotâ for It was nothing less than a riot
was half an hour In coming to a boiling
point. In the face of its rising Roosevelt
insisted on finishing what he had to say
to the people of Victor and refused to
l"ave the hall until the time appointed for
the meeting expired. In the crowd that
attacked him were many miners from
the Coeur d'Alene district In Idaho, and
they raised the name of Coeur d'Alene as
an alternative battlecry with that of the
candidate of the Democratic party for
President of the United States.

NEWPORT, R. I., Sept. 26.â The board
of arbitrament at Its meeting to-day gave
out Its decision as to the operations that
have been held here the last two days by
the ships of the North Atlantic squadron.
The attack of the Holland on the Kear
sargro was not allowed. At the time the
Holland says she torpedoed the Kear
narge the battleship had her running
lights up, and, this, the board says, was
enough to rule the Holland's attack un
successful, as the battleship was not
looking for an enemy. The board is loud
in its praise of the nerve and courage of
the commander of the Holland, admitting
that she went five miles out to sea when
she was at any moment liable to be cut
down by a vessel. It al&4* admitted that
tl\e trial with her could be considered as
a fair one.
Many are of the opinion that the com
manders were afraid of this craft and did
not wish It stated that their vessel had
been picked up by the new defender of
the seas.
In regard to the first night the decision
is that the Stiletto was successful in her
attack on the battleship Massachusetts,
and that she torpedoed her before she ran
ashore at Fort Adams.
In regard to the ramming of the Kear
sargÂ« by the tug Leyden it Is the ruling
that the Kearsarge was out of the field
of action at the time and that the claim
Is not allowed.*,
In regard to the work of the torpedo
fleet last night the decisions * entirely
change the reports of the umpire as to
various torpedo-boats. It seems that the
only torpedo-boat that was successful in
torpedoing was the Gwynn. and that she
put out the Scorpion and the Eagle. The
Porter, Morris and Gwynn were put out
by the Kearsarge and the Dahlgren by
the Indiana. This is Just the reverse of
what was reported last night. The Texas
was the only vessel that was not found,
and It is said that she truned tail and
went far out to sea. so that she could
not be found. The operations are consid
ered a success and they will be the sub
ject of discussion In the national war col
lege on Friday. /<

The fact that numerically the IncreaiÂ«Â«
of the population of these cities has comÂ»Â»
out just about the same during the last
two censuses is more interesting from tho
fact that the rates of increase of the vari
ous cities have varied greatly.
WASHINGTON. Sept. S9.â Statistic*
have been compiled at the Census Bureau
based on the population of larse cities
'which have been announced up to tha
present time which demonstrate that the
155 largest cities In the United States nu
merically Increased In population from ISM
to 100O almost exactly as they did between
1SSO and 1S90. These 133 cities increased
their population 4,706.107 from 1&S0 to 1SW
arid 4.627.953 from 1S00 to 1900, or Just 73,154
less durinsr the latter than In the former
period. Of course, when the aggregate
percentapes of Increase of thÂ« population
of these 155 cities during these two peri

Affairs were quiet to-day throughout the

Scranton, in which threje men were

is the remarkably good behavior of th<;

that more than JOO.000 mine workers are
idle in the anthracite region.

The daily production of coal in the dis

from the shipments of coal from that re

will not go to work to-morrow morning.
The force of men at each .of the Markle
slopes is now very shorthanded. The firm
for the time being refuses to discuss any
thing in connection with its future ac
tions.
The men also decided to remain at work
pending the arbitration negotiations and
agreed to ask the firm - to "deduct
from the pay of each family that
returns to work their quota for the pay
ment of the arbitrator selected bv the
men."
The crisis at the mines of G. B. Markle
& Co. has been reached. There were
many expressions among the men to-day
of dissatisfaction with some of the firm's
answtrs to the demands. The principal
grievance of the men is the wage scale.
They ask for only about half of what the
United Mine Workers are demanding.
Operations at the Markle collieries were
suspended to-day so that the employes
could hold meetings to discuss the firm's
answer. The meeting was held in the
forenoon, and this afternoon the commit
tees, composed of employes of the several
Markle mines, with the exception of Eber
vnle (which is completely tied up), made
known to the firm the decision of the em
ployes. They accept the firm's proposi
tion in regard to the hoisting of men from
the slope, acquiesce in the refusal to pay
the engineers by the hour and want to
arbitrate all the other grievances except
ing those relating to semi-monthly pay
and the location of powder house*, which
have been adjusted by the answer of
Markle & Co.
No disturbances were reported in this
region to-day. Rumors of contemplated
marches of strikers are constantly in cir
culation, but as far as can be learned
there is no truth in any of them. The
march e-Â»rly yesterday morning from
Cranberry to Derringer was kept a secret
until the starting- time, and 'the strikers
may again get away on a similar march.
The Sin-riff is kept well informed of every
move the strikers make in the way of
marching and will try to be on hand in
every instance to see that life and prop
erty are not placed* in jeopardy.
Threo strikers were arrested by coal and
iron police to-day, charged with unlawful
assemblage and trespassing, while walk
ing along the railroad tracks on Lrf-high
Valley Coal Company property between
this company's No. 40 shaft and No. 3
slope in the eastern part of the city. They
were released after a hearing this after
noon.
"The fact that I have called on the Gov
ernor for help is true. 1 have since been
in communication with him and also Gen
end Gobin, who aesurts me tharupon the
Slightest overt act by the unlawful as
sembling of men that he will have troops
here within an hour, and also assures me
that they will stay until all the trouble
is over."
The Sheriff to-day gave out the follow
ing for the information of the citizens of
this region:
HAZLETONT. Pa.. Sopt." 26.â The request
made yesterday by Sheriff Harvey for
troops, although not refused, was not
granted by Governor Stone. The Sheriff
and the Stato officials at UarrlsburK,
however, have an understanding: between
thorn, and if the necessity arises soldiers
will be thrown into this region in short
order. If this be done the first to arrive
would probably be one of the commands
now stationed at Shenandoah. The Sher
ilT had a long talk with Adjutant General
Stewart over the telephone and they
agreed that in view of the calmness now
prevailing throughout the L,ehigh Valley
it would be inadvisable to send an armed
force here at this time.

__^ EGISTR.ATIOX came to an end
| last night at 12 o'clock so far as
fr^^ the November election is con-
JL % cerned. The total registration is
V 73,945, as against 72,992 in ISM and
62.410 in 1S9S. Registrar "Walsh had esti
mate's the probable registration at 75,000
when registration began, but he and the
party leaders feel well satisfied with the
results accomplished.
The Registrar had put on a. large num
ber of extra clerks, In the main those who
attended to registration In the precincts
and so were familiar with the work. In
all there -was a force of fifty men ready
to receive the rush of unregistered voters
on the last day for registration.
Throughout the day registration pro
ceeded steadily and at 5 o'clock 1300 had
been registeredâ the largest number of
any day since the new register was
O^" night the crush of belated voters
was unprecedented. The constant re
! minders by the newspaper?, the efforts of
the County Central Committees of the
two parties, working through the district
clubs, and the twenty-foot-long transpar
encies on wagons sent out by Registrar
"Walsh had the proper effect, and no
voter who has failed to get on the register
can blame any one but himself.
The Registrar'? office was kept open
until midnight with a full fcrce of depu
ties on hand, so that however negligent
the voter had been he would be able to
rr -ter if he arrived at the last minute
al.v. A-ed for registration by the law. The
number registered between 8 o'clock and
midnight was 1650.
WILIi EXERCISE .INDEPENDENCE
in Local Affairs.
Voters Will Not Be Bound by Party
In the local campaign the Republicans
intend to exercise the right to vote for
clean candidates, regardless of party
brands. Indications also point to the free
exercise of that privilege by the. Demo
crats. The extent of Independent voting
will astonish the partisans. The Supreme
Court decision overthrowing the primary
election law took away from both parties
the lawful means of creating and organiz
ing municipal conventions. Martin Kelly's
henchmen, by operation of the court's de
cision, were left free to stuff ballot-boxes
at their pleasure and pack nominating
conventions with their sympathetic crea
tures. Nominations bestowed by Kelly's
convention were not derived from the Re
publican party, hence the voters of that
party have a perfect right to make indi
vidual selection of candidates on the
ticket.
In the selection of favorites for the
Legislature the Republicans should exer
cise intelligent and independent discrimin
ation. Take^ for example, the Forty-first
Assembly District. No objection was
made to Democrats who offered to vote
at the primary election for the Dibble
delegation. In many instances the voters
of Democratic faith were not challenged,
hence no tests were applied. It is known
that W. F. Herrin, a Democrat in the law
department of the Southern Pacific, voted
and was not even required to take the
test of loyalty to the Republican party.
Many other Democrats voted the Dibble
ticket at the direction or Martin Kelly.
If the citizens of the Forty-first desire
that Dibble, whose crooked methods are
commented on from one end of the State
to the other, should be again elected to
the Legislature, they will vote for him.
If they think that an honest, square and
intelligent young man should be sent to
Sacramento as the representative of the
district they will vote for Oscar Sutro.
If the voters fear that Sutro Is too young
and Dibble too crooked they can support
L. C. Pistolesi, a lawyer who is older
than Sutro and straighter than Dibble.
As Martin Kelly is reaching out to gain
absolute control of the Forty-first Dis
trict for use in the campaign two years
hence. Republicans should organize at
once to defeat the boss. The Republicans
of the district must make the battle of
their lives to shake off boss rule before
it becomes too late to resist. Every clean
Republican in the district should join the
Horace Davis Republican Club at once.
The absurd notion that a vote against
Dibble will hurt the national ticket ought
to be dismissed as rank nonsense. It is
the cry of the corrupt boss to frighten the
weak and timid. Present and enduring
Republican success can be achieved by
kicking the bosses and boodlers out of
the party. The fight in the Forty-first is
up to the good people of the district. If
they return Dibble to the Legislature the
territory which he represents will be
known hereafter as the champion boodle
district of California. It is a fact that
Dibble never did represent the residents
of the district. He represented the bosses,
the corporations and the general herd of'
jobbers.
Is there a voter in the district who will
dare say that Dibble represented the> citi
zens of the Forty-first when he sat in the
library and divided $7000 of telegraph
money?
In the Forty-second District Melville
Hermann will run as an independent Re
publican candidate. He has a petition ex
tensively signed by leading citizens and
property owners of the district and will
have a place on the official ballot. The
district was not represented in the As
sembly of' the last Legrslature. When the
roll was called. for the election of United
States Senator there was a voice from the
Forty-second in favor of the boss candi
date, but only that and nothing more, j

BUSINESS MEN
FORM CLUB TO
SUPPORT KAHN
Organize a Non - Partisan
Movement to Secure His
Re-election.
Prominent Merchants -Praise the
Present Congressman for His
Services to ban Francisco's
Commercial Interests.
Prominent merchants, grateful for ser
vices rendered to San Francisco's com
mercial interests by Congressman Kahn,
organized a business men's Julius Kahn
Club yesterday afternoon and will work
to secure the re-election of the present
Congressman from the Fourth District.
The movement is a notable one, as it
is the first club of the kind ever organ
ized here. The business men themselves
took the initiative without any suggestion
from politicians and among those Inter
ested are someâ such as A. A. Watkins
and E. R. Lilienthalâ who have in the
past been high in Democratic councils.
The meeting was held at 415 Market
street, where rooms have been secured for
the use of the club. H. D. Loveland was
elected president and Ernest R. Lillenthal
treasurer. Charles F. Tay was chosen as
temporary secretary. A paid secretary
will be employed to do the club's clerical
work.
A committee of five, consisting of Wil
liam R. Wheeler. Ernest R. Llllenthal. A.
C Rulofson. Leopold Klau and Maurice
Feictuch, reported the following names to
compote the executive committee:
Winis.ni R. Wheeler. H. D. Loveland. J. D.

The report was approved and a motion
to empower the president to select from
the executive committee a working com
mittee of twelve was carried. The presi
dent was also empowered to add to the
fxecutive committee names of residents
In every precinct of San Francisco.
"Though I voted against Mr. Kahn at
the !aet election," Mr. Loveland said, in
explaining^ the objects of the club, "I am
now willing to work in hi? support. He
has a habit of looking after the things
that are called to his attention and he has
been so vigilant and active in caring for
the Interests of San Francisco that he
ought to be re-elected. We invite mer
chants to Join the club whether they re
elde in the Fourth Congressional District
or not. They can work for Mr. Kahn'!*
election., though they may not be able to
vote for him.
"San Francisco's commercial Interests,"
paid A. C. Rulofson, "are the greatest
Â¦west of the Mississippi. It Is to our ad
vantage to have In congress a man wlrh
the commercial instinct. Mr. Kahn is
tuch a man. He follows these matters up
and forces the departments at Washing
ton to recognize our interests."
William R. Wheeler pointed out that
the Governments system of purchasing
for the army works to the disadvantage
cf San Francisco.
"l^rce depots of supplies are estab
lished." said Mr. "Wheeler. "The depot
for clothing is at Philadelphia; for camp
supplies, at Jeffersonville. Ind. : and for
hardware at New York. We lose the ad
vantage of o-ur geographical position. We
cannot bid on goods that must be deliv
ered at these depots.
"What we hope to secure through the
aid of Mr. Kar.n's able services is the
passage of a. bill establishing a great de.
pot here for supplies for troops here and
in the Philippines. Then we would have a
lighting chance in the bidding. Eastern
bidders â¢would not be phut out and the
Government's best interests as well as
cur own would be served."
Congressman Kahn was present and
was called upon for a speech. He said:
"I cannot tell you how much I appre
ciate the great compliment you have paid
Be in the organization of this club. I
realize that San Francisco is the great
commercial center of the coast. We nave
great interests at stake. Competition is
keen. The cities of Pugret Sound are
forging ahead rapidly and are trying to
cut Into our trade. In the past San Fran
cisco has not learned the advantage or
keeping a man in Congress and reaping
ihe benefit of his increasing knowledge of
details and, influence In CongTess and
â¢.raong the departments.
"No man can be entirely familiar with
the commercial interests of a city like
Pan Francisco, and it has been a great
pleasure to me to receive frequent lettera
j.nd telegrams asking me to go to tho
department and look out for certain in
terests. I have courted such suggestions.
*.nd if I am re-elected it will always be
my pleasure to fieht for the merchants
of San Francisco.'

registered on July 30 at the City Hall from
the Twelfth Precinct of the Thirty-sev
enth District, giving his residence as 76S
Hayes street. Last Saturday he regis
tered at 44 Grove street before Deputies
Michael Smith and L. A. Larsen in Pre
cinct 3, District 39, giving his address as
215 Polk street, and the same day he reg
istered at 131- Larkin street before Depu
ties A. W. Phillips and T. J. Cooney, Pre
cinct 2, District 39, giving his address as
1654 Market street. .-In two cases he gave
his occupation as a barber and In the
other as an electrician.
After his arrest Giles was taken before
Captain Seymour and the Registrar. The
only excuse he offered was that he was
drunk at the time he registered Mast Sat
urday and did it as a "josh" on the dep
uties, who all knew him. He used to live
at 1654 Market street and kept a barber
shop at 213 Polk. He claimed that he was
an electrician as well as a barber.
The Registrar said he had called at a
barber shop at 817 Laguna street, where
Giles said he worked, and ascertained
that he had been discharged from there
about two months ago and that when he
left he took several things with him that
did not belong to him. Giles' record is
not a good one. He was arrested about
six years ago for burglary and was held
to answer, but was acquitted in Judge
Hebbard's court. He has been arrested
several times for minor offenses. He was
cruel to his young wife, and It is said
that his cruelty was largely the cause of
her death in Los Angeles recently.

FAIR SEX ENTERTAINED
BY THE OLYMPIC CLUB
Athletes Perform for Edification of
the Ladies â An Excellent Pro
gramme Rendered.
The fair sex held full sway at the Olym-
pic Club last evening. It was "ladies'
night" and the entertainment presented
was greatly enjoyed by the audience
which filled the spacious gymnasium to
overflowing. The programme consisted of
wrestling and boxing bouts, wand drills,
singing and a speech by "Uncle George"
Bromley. The entertainment was under
the direction of John A. Hammersmith,
the popular leader of the club.. There
vere no delays in the programme.. .
After an overture there was some grace
ful springboard leaping by Ed Stack, Har
old Manor,- W. Cavanaugh, H. Bresjern,
Joe Connor, W. O'Leary, George Olsen,
Ed Miller and Professor Robert Leando.
H. W. Schreiber won applause by his
clever club swinging- and twenty-four
Juveniles under the command of Profes
sor George S. Miehling gave an interest
ing wana drill. P. Bayly and J. Splro, G.
A. Hensley and W. King performed on
the mat. Gacb athlete succeeded in get
ting a fall in catch-as-catch-can wrest
ling. C. Jenkins and M. Milward sue 1
ceeded in capturing tirst and second prizes
in the Westmoreland wrestling bouts.
They had as opponents W. H. King, H.
Gray, J. A. Mackenzie and C. D. Pen
thony.
Miss Emilia Siebrecht rendered "Let Me
Love Thee," by Ardlttl, and for an encore
sang another pretty' ballad. The triple
horizontal bar performance of Rudolph
Moll and J. Rand was a feature of the
programme. Moll's work on the bars was
&a thrilling as Rand's was laughable. Lit
tle Cora Louise Spear sang and danced
like a professional.
\V. J. Leonard, a clever amateur light
weight, and Dan Whelan, one of Cor
bett's favorite pupils, put up a scientific
exhibition with the padded mitts. J. F.

sport with the gloves. Robert Elwert's
bag punching was greatly enjoyed. The
Hawaiian Quartet rendered native melo
dies and E. Kehrlein and O. Kehrlein gave
an interesting exhibition with the foils.
At the close of the entertainment the au
dience descended to the swimming tank
and saw some clever high and fancy div
ing by D. Carroll, F. Doran, F. Burnett,
F. Bayley, Lester Hammersmith, E.
Stack, F. Beale, AI Lean, W. Leonard,
John A. Hammersmith and Swimming
Instructor Sid Cavill. The latter swam
a fast exhibition mile and did fancy stunts
in the water.
GRIP I/OSES TH^ T CABLE
AND CAR SUDES DOWN
Passengers on California-Street Line
Given a Fright and Deprive^ .
of Their Ride.
Shortly before 6 o'clock last night a
California street car slipped its grip as it
was trying to climb the rails over Kearny
street. It was heavily laden and com
menced to descend rapidly, but was
caught by the brakes and backed down
again".
A wait was made for the grip to catch
its breath, andin the meantime a second
car came along and attached Its forward
couplings for the purpose of pushing the
disabled car up the hill.
ThA two with an Increased load of pas
sengers then attempted to "buck" the
grade. They starteu off with a Jolt, as
the grips bit into the steel cable and
chewed for dear life as the gripmen
strove with the levers. Half way up the
steep block above Dupont street there
came a 'roaring, grinding noise and a big
cloud of smoke from under the cars, scar
ing the passengers into the belief that an
explosion was about to take place. They
again stopped, and the frightened people
hustled each other into the street. No
sooner had thirty or forty 6f them cleared
out than the cars again started off, leav
ing the members of the angry crowd to
mourn the loss of their nickels as they
watched the train disappear over the hill.
It was found on examination of the
grips that 'Â¦ the heavy load had caused
them to slip until the friction heat had
burned out the bushings and fired the tar
which is used for the lubrication cf the
cable.
At 12:30 there was another accident
on the California-street road, caused by
the breaking of a grip on Pine street,
near Jones. The grip broke in- such a
way as to keep hold of the rope that
pulled the" car along, but when at the
turn into Hyde street the gripman tried
to let go. the grip still held on.
At that corner the rope goes straight
on to a shive in the center of the cross
ing and then turns, while the track goes
round in a broad curve and the cars make
the turn by gravity* When the gripman
tried to let go and failed, the grip went
straight on with the rope, and becoming
twisted in the track brought the car to
a sudden stop. Windows were broken and
the" passengers were pretty well shaken
up, but no one was hurt.
The board believes that certain
principals in the department have
been governed by political and per
sonal influences in their requests for
the assienment of teachers.â Extract
from a resolution adopted by the Board of
Education.
The Board of Education adopted a reso
lution at yesterday's meeting which con
tains the accusation that certain princi
pals have allowed political and personal
Influences to sway them In their requests
for assignment of teachers. In making
this accusation the board acknowledges
that It has been a party to the scheme by
ignoring the chronological order of ap
pointment which it had agreed to obey.
In assigning Miss Davis to a new class
yesterday the board did so to the exclu
sion of fifteen teachers whose original ap
pointments antedate hers, she having
been elected September 8. 1S97.
The resolution referred to is as follows:
Whereas, While article VII. chapter III. sec
tion 1, subdivision 2, of the charter, provides
that teachers should be appointed and assigned
on merit and successful experience, not neces
sarily on lencth of service; and
Whereas. The Board or Education believes
that this Is the proper mar.ner of appointing
teacher*, nevertheless, owing to the fact that
such a large number of substitutes and un
assigned teachers are waiting to be appointed
to vacancies; and
Whereas. The board believes that certain prin
cipals in the department have been governed
by political and personal influences in their re
quests for the asslrrnment of teachers; be It
Resolved. That teachers from the day sub
stitute or evening eligible lists be assigned In
chronological order to vacancies unless they
have been formerly reported against, and that
principals after giving the assigned teachers
a reasonable trial, shall report, through the
secretary of the board, to the Board of Edu
cation if the teacher is found inefficient.
Miss M. A. Hill and Miss C. E. Beck
with incurred the displeasure of the board
because they left their positions without
permission, and they Â¦were dropped from
the roll of the department. Miss Beck
with committed the enormous crime of
asking for a year's leave of absence be
cause she intends to get married and
wishes to pass her honeymoon in Europe.
Chairman Mark admitted recently that
if the lady had only intended to visit Eu
rope with the marriage feature cut out
the board might have granted the desired
leave.
According to the language of another
resolution, William Fogel was "expelled
from the public schools owing to his utter
disregard for the rules," which caused
his principal, L. D. Bartlett, to recom
mend his expulsion.
A new class was formed in the Spring
Valley Grammar School, and Miss F. Da
vis, formerly of that school, was assigned
to take charge of it.
The words "during leave of Miss A. B.
Campbell" were stricken out of the reso
lution of August 15, 1900, assigning Miss
M. A. Latham to the Grant School.
The sum of $3 additional per month was
allowed regular teachers holding special
certificates in music, German and French.
The salary of Mrs. R. J. de Yoe was
fixed at $130 for September, she having
served without pay during August.
The sum of $12 per month was allowed
the principal of the Lincoln Grammar
School for petty repairs upon the school.

POLITICS IN
REQUESTS FOR
ASSIGNMENTS
â¢Assessor Dodge will not be permitted
to retain without a struggle the whole of
the $15,000 polltax commissions to which
Judge Seawell decided he was legally en
titled. Supervisor McCarthy said yester
day that. he would endeavor to formulate
some plan, for adoption by the board
whereby the Assessor would be required
to pay for the collection of polltaxes out
of the 15 per cent commission allowed by
the State. McCarthy contends that the
city should not pay the expenses tor col
lecting- a State tax, though that has been
the custom in the past. The depaty as
sessors receive tneir monthly stipend
from the municipality, and they collect
polltaxes either while making assess
ments or independently of their other
duties.
'McCarthy, has not yet determined In
what way the Assessor may be prohibited
trom ordering the city's employes to col
lect polltaxes and be compelled to pay for
such services out of the commissions al
lowed by the State. McCarthy is in
formed that in an other counties of the
State thÂ» Assessor is required to pay for
the collection or polltaxes out of tne gen
erous commissions allowed. Tne Political
Code is rather vague on the question as
to whether- the Assessor should retain all
of the commissions. ' Section 3862 Bays
that the Assessor for services rendered
In the collection of polltaxes shall receive
the sum of 15 per cent. The last Grand
Jury once had .Dodge "on the carpet" re
garding the way in which this language
should be construed. That body took the
ground that while the code was rather
Indefinite the intent was to pay the ex
pense of collecting polltaxes out of the
commission.
McCarthy will bring the point up before
his colleagues In the shape of a resolu
tion or ordinance at some meeting of the
board in the near future. He says that
even If Dodge were- to pay the expense
of collecting out- of his commissions he
would be lett with a comfortaWe nest egg
amounting to probably 17500 a^year.
City Attorney Lane said yesterday that
he â¢would take an Immediate appeal from
Judge Seawell's decision, notwithstanding
the published statement that he would
not do so.
Supervisor McCarthy Will Bring
Matter Before Board â City Attor
ney Will Appeal From Judge
Seawell's Decision.

THE TANFORAN HORSE
SHOW WHICH ATTRACTED
MARKED ATTENTION.
The booklÂ«: found !t impossible to put
away any coin laying: prices against thÂ«
trotters and pacers participating in the
exercises at Oakland track, and yesterday
not a chalk mark was made against any
of the starters Jn either the 2:13 trot or
2:15 pace. Miss Jersie, driven by Charley
Durfee, captured the first mentioned af
fair in straight heats and the erratic
Dlctatrus annexed tho purse for lateral
gaited equine*. Neither aroused any enow
of eathuslasm.
As on the preceding days the attend
ance was erood, with, interest entirely con
fined to the runs. Two first choices
ehoTred.flrft over a very plow track.
A 6urprisingrly good price was laid about
Briar Hill, winner of the first flve-furlong
eprlnt. The black horsÂ« looked a legiti
mate 4 to 6 chance, etill 3 to 2 was ob
tainable. With Ruiz up he won In a gal
lop, jarrlngr the books considerably. St.
Anthony took thÂ» place quite as easily
from Sister Lizzie, aa up-country tip.
After many trips to the barrier Louisa
Hayman, trained by Jonnny Campbell,
finally eloped with the lone end of, a
purse. One of; nine starters in the second
dash at five furlongs the ring laid 3 to 1
against the black filly. She quickly as
sumed the lead after the start and never
he&ded, !e<1 Kor Kreedom, the favorite,
out eix lengnhs. Druidess was third.
While Merry Boy. 4 to 5 favorite for the
ffcven furlong number, was bowled over
It was no "easrle-bird" for the books, aa
Flush of Gold had a hoet of friends. The
raiart set thought the distance and tha
weight 10S pounds, too heavy for the last
named tilly. She fooled them by never
being- hwided. breasting ihe tape two
lengths before the choice, Â©how honors

Siilted In a blue ribbon for one of J. Dow
?iey Harvey's unnamed. John Lawson's
Indian Chief second and. F. J. Carolan's
Prince Charming third. .-
The last of the horse exhibits was for
jumpers. F. J. Carolan's Merry Boy waa
decorated with blue, an unnamed owned
by Downey Harvey getting the red and
K. D. Beylard's Friar the white. . .
The pony and steeplechase racing con
cluded the programme. But two races
were run, owing to the lateness of the
hour. The first, between F. J. Carolan's
Three Cheers, Jones up, Carolan's Prin
jcess Flavia, Walter Hobart up, and J.
J. Moore's Squaw, Charte3 Dunphy up,
finished in the above order. This race
was for a quarter of a mile. The second
race, mile and a half, over hurdles, was
won easily by Allen on Peter Martin's Six
Bits, Lomax on John Lawson'a Blucher
second and Lenhart on T. A. Drlscoll's
Absinthe third. Lenhart was thrown in
jumping -the third hurdle, but he picked
himself up and finished within the money.
The dog show opened with great eclat.
The aisles., whereon reposed the repre
sentatives of all that is most aristocratic
in canine haut ton, were crowded, despite
the fact that the dogs had to compete
with other and strong attractions. In the
first place, the dogs were expelled from
the judging ring because the ring was
needed for the accommodation of the cat
tle. The expulsion served to ruffle the
friends of man and was doubtless the
cause of the Irritability of temper that re
sulted in a fight in the judging ring be
tween two St. Bernards, Sir Robert Bruce
and California Eboraciim. Eboracum did
most of the biting, incidentally sinking a
few teeth in the hand of his trainer, who
Â¦was acting as peacemaker.
Judge Lacy's decisions were received
with approval. The mastiffs were few and
poor, with the exceptions of Champion,
California Cube and the latter's offspring,
Sharkey, who obtained, respectively, first
and reserve in the winners. Miss Hatje's
California Queen was alone In her classes
and took first in the winners also. The
sensation of the show waa sprung in the
shape of that notable winner, Le King,
by Champion Le Prince out of Sylvia s
Lola, who at an outlay of $500 has been
brought out from Mrs. Lee's kennels at
Toledo by Philip C. Meyer. Mr. Meyer
certainly proves by deeds his enthusiasm
for the saintly breed, and his Judgment
was justified to-day by the ease with
which Le King disposed of his rivals
winning first in every class. Le King hav
ing just arrived from the East, was not
in the best condition, and neither was his
kennel mate, Alta Rachel, but both were
good enough to win out. The exhibition
of St. Bernards more than made jup for
their lack of quantity by their quality
there were only thirty-one entries, and
not a poor specimen toÂ»be seen. Omar
Khayyam, the Los Angeles dog, was in
rare form, and it was a close race be
tween him and California Eboracum for
second honors. The latter won on his
superior activity. Another representative
of the Oakland St. Bernard Kennels took
the reserve in the bitches, Alta Rachel
winning out, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Fayely
thus carrying off first and reserve winners
respectively in both sexes.
Tho Tanforan Fair opened yesterday
morning- with a continuation of the horse
enow, switched In the early afternoon to
a livestock parade, went back to the
horse display soon after and wound up
with two races for polo ponies. While the
horses were jumping hurdles, looking
proud under the finest of harness and
prancing up and down the course, the dog
fanciers were dragging their pets into the
Judging ring, while the cattle owners were
watching with solicitous eyes the judges
of livestock as they passed upon the best
of their herds.
The programme of the third day of the
fair was the most varied of all. This did
not help the attendance to any great de
gree, although society showed itself late
in the afternoon. Fresh and gay in after
noon dress, many of the guests of the
Taylor-Hopkins wedding dropped into
Tanforan un their way home from Menlo
Park and created considerable stir. Then
it was that the gentlemen riders and
drivers displayed a sudden and absorbing
interest in the exhibitions and races. Wal
ter Hobart, with his lame shoulder, rode
and drove. Henry Crocker tugged at the
reins once again. Frank Carolan did
fancy stunts upon a fancy horse. Every
groom in the Bvirlingame colony was
called into action.
Early in the day A. B. Spreckels' thor
oughbred stallion Creighton was paraded
and won easily in till classes in wnich he
was entered. Another blue ribbon for
Mr. Spreckels was obtained by the exhi
bition of a black yearling colt by Puryear.
out of Straight Tip. McKinney, owned
by C. A. Durfee, entered in the stallion
class with four of his get. received the
iirst mark of distinction. In class 10 for
stallions three years or over McKinney
and Ben Liebes were the only entries and
took prizes in the order named. W. O.
Booths Black Wllkes. two-year-old, was
awarded a blue ribbon without competi
tion. Prince B, a yearling stallion exhib
ited by \V. P. Batchelder, received a bit
of blue, and Flora M. a brood mare, was
equally as fortunate. S. Ohristenson's
Simone. in class 14, for mares three years
or over, was the only entry, Eulah Me
having been withdrawn. Juan Gallegos'
Lrinda. the only two-year-old filly entered,
and Estrella, a, yearling belonging to the
same owner, won first prizes.
In class 40 a split was made on account
of breed. H. G. Goecken's Chief of Kneip
hausen. a three-year-old stallion, took the
blue ribbon from Native Son, same owner
W. H. Howard's British Oak, age 18 years,
was decorated with the blue, as was also
Joseph Riser's Uncle Sam.
Charles Neuman's roans, Maud Neuman
and Neerbell. fell before John Parrott's
Cockade and Crinoline in a competition
on quality, action and going. In class SO
John Parrott's Bravo received a blue rib
bon, W. S. Hobart's Madison Square the
red and same owner's Monarch the white.
The high-steppers' class was a victory for
Bravo also, P. J. Carolan's Athlete and
Silver Tips taking the other prizes.
Henry J. Crocker's road tandem Clover
dale and Moorland won from E. D. Bey
lard's unnamed team and F. J. Carolan's
Sporting Duchess and Silver Tips.
In class 96 P. J. Carolan's pair of ponies.
Fiddlesticks and School Girl, took iirst
prize. Peter Martin's Sheet and Bumps
getting the red. The pony four-in-hand
competition between Peter, D. Martin's
and F. J. Carolan's teams went to the
latter.
Marion, yearning for competition in the
gaited saddle horse class, exhibited by
William C. Smith, was decorated with a
blue ribbon. P. J. Carolan's trick mare,
the Sporting- Duchess, was a blue-ribbon
winner, only entry in class 112. Henry
Crocker's Bessie In class 114 took a pony
prize, sole entry.
In the qualified hunters' class "F. J.
Cardan's Spectator won a blue ribbon and
his Merry Boy the red. E. D. Beylard
was disappointed, getting the white
streamer. The green hunters' exhibit re-
Th'e midweek stake at Union Park yes
terday furnished many long, hard courses
and quite a number of the entries were
withdrawn in consequence. Sara won tho
stake by default. Rusty Gold, who was
to be her opponent, had more than his
share of work and in his last run went
such a long route that he was unable to
come back and consequently forfeited.
Random Aim, -in the semi-final, after a
hard day's coursing, was slipped with
Rusty to a strong hare, which gave the
dogs all kinds of running close to the
escape. While doing his. best the Pasha
Kennels' entry fell, and though making a
strong effort could not get on his feet
for v Bome time. When he did recover he
tried for the game." but the course was
ended.
Sara made a good showing in the stake
and allowed- her opponents to score but
few points.
Cruiser was an important factor In the
day's sport and his work Illustrated to a
degree the Ins and outs of coursing. In
the run-down he was drawn against Jesse
Moore, and the talent made him a 2 to 1
favorite. He lost, this course and further
along in the round was selected as the
bye doj? with Aeneas. His previous work
handicapped him against a fresh dog and
5 to 1 was quoted against him in thB
course. He surprised even the stouteut
piker, and landed a winner. Then in the
next round, against For Glory, of whom
so much was expected, Cruiser got the
flag in a long course and had. points to
spare. For Glory was a 10 to 1 favorite,
and after this severe run was withdrawn.
Â¦ As good as 15 to 1 was offered against
"Wild Monarch in hit* po with Patriot, out
she outworked McComh's dog and won ny
a score of IS to 14. Half a dozen other
short ends made the stake Interesting t'J
the jpikers.

One of the Jurors stated that the failure
of Howard to bring any of the occupants
of the executive building on January 30 to
testify that he was not there was consid
ered by the Jury as an indication that he
was there. The testimony of Gaines as
to seeing Howard run out of the grounds
and also of Stubblefleld. who swbre that
Howard confessed the killing: a few davs
after the murder, were the other princi
pal points upon which the Jury relied
Howard's attorney will at once apply
for a new trial, basing the motion on al
tered expressions of several of the Jury
made prior to the trial which were hos

h^ V7v taln juror made the statement
that all the suspects under arrest ou^ht
to be hanged, and he particularly specified
Howard as one upon whom the death pen
alty ought to be pronounced.
The verdict of the Jury, it is believed,
was based largely upon the destruction
or Howard s alibi, upon which he depend
ed solely.
After the verdict had been rendered
Howard was remanded to Jail, where he
was followed by his bosom friend. J. G.
White, who seemed almost paralyzed by
the verdict. Howard's cheeks also'blanch
ed as he stood up to accompany the jailer
to his cell.
The Jury consisted of nine Democrats,
one Republican and two anti-Goebel
Democrats. -
One of the jurors stated that a number
of ballots were taken, but the first bal
lot resulted In a unanimous vote for a
verdict of guilty. After that the ballots
yesterday were as to the degree of pun
ishment. Ten members voted for the
death penalty, while two voted for life
imprisonment. The first ballot to-day re
sulted in a verdict; the two jurors who

HANDSOME "JIM" HOWARD. THE NOTED KENTUCKY MOUNTAIN
EER. WHO HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF BEING A PRINCIPAL IN
THE ASSASSINATION OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR GOEBEL.
MILL VALLEY, Sept. 26.-M111 Valley
has a school problem that is giving coun
ty officials and men learned In the law
something to ponder over. According to
the present situation, twelve scholars of
the Eastland School district will receive
the sole benefit of the $12,000 worth of
bonds recently voted In that district.
Before its incorporation about a month
ago Mill Valley comprised the most pop
ulous part of the Eastland School Dis
trict. Early last spring It was decided
that the district needed a new school
house and a bond election was called. It
was voted to expend $12,000 In building and
equipping an up-to-date structure.
Not content with a $12,000 schoolhouse,
the people of Eastland School District
wanted Mill Valley Incorporated. The
election was held, and after a bitter fight
Mill Valley was duly incorporated as a
town. Here is where the Joker put in an
appearance. The new town of Mill Val
ley, though containing nearly all the In
habitants of Eastland School District,
does not comprise the entire district. By
the mere act .of Incorporation a new
school district was formed. What Is left
of the Eastland District is mostly undi
vided ranches. There are about fifteen
school children resident In the remnant of
the once extensive district. The $12,030 re
ceived from the bond sale belongs to the
Eastland District.
The town of Mill Valley does not like
tho Idea of losing the big schoolhouse.
After looking up the laws, it was decided
that the only thing to da was to go to
Eastland with the "glad hand" and a
large petition praying that the Eastland
ites will give their consent to the merg
ing of the two districts Into one and the
erecting of the large schoolhouse where
it will be most convenient to all. Ine pa
rents of Eastland hold the trumps, and
they may feel disposed to keep the $12,000
schoolhouse all to themselves.

SAX DIEGO, Sept. 26.â Word has been
received from London of the marriage
there of Miss Ella Ale. for several years
a teacher in this county, to George A.
Dixon of Birmingham, Pa. The bride will
be remembered by most of the educators
of the. State because of the fight which
she had In the County Board and the
State Board of Education concerning her
certificate to teach. She was granted a
certificate by the local board on other
cprtificates which she brought from the
East, and the County Board also recom
mended that she be granted a State cer
tificate. That was done, and Miss Ale
taught for several years. It was then dis
covered that the papers which she pre
sented from the East were not up to the
requirements, though she had presented
them believing that they were.
The effort to obtain a cancellation of
the certificate by some of Miss Ale's ene
mies was what caused the State-wide
fame of the case. The County Board did
not care to act because It was Â« State
certificate, and the State Board did not
care to act until the County Board with
drew its recommendation. The case went
back and forth several times and mean
while Miss Ale was tenchlnp on the cer
tificate. Finally, after several years' con
sideration, the State Board decided that
Miss Ale was guiltless of any Intention to
defraud, but that she must surrender the
certificate. Before that time, however,
she had announced her Intention to cease
teaching because of her approaching mar
riage.

THE LIBRARY PROBLEM.
UPON the question of removing the Mercantile
Library from its present quarters to a down
town .location there may be differences of
opinion among the members of the institution, but the
general public will be well nigh unanimous in op
posing it. The interest of the public in the matter is
due to the fact that San Francisco has no libra-y
worthy of a city of this size, and is not likely to have
one in the near future unless in some way the Mer
cantile be combined with that of the Mechanics* In
stitute. Such a combination has long been under con
sideration by all who have given any serious thoughts
to the library needs of the Â»ity. The removal of the
Mercantile Library downtown would be the begin-*
rung of an experiment which would have to run its
course before the combination could be effected, and
would therefore be a postponement of a desired end
that should be accomplished as speedily as possible.
There is hardly a single chance that the Mercantile
would Tiave any better success downtown than it has
in its present quarters. There is no need of two down
town libraries, but there is great need of one good
one. The removal would cost the Mercantile a con
< dcrable ; sum of money, and the trustees cannot have
my sanguine hope of obtaining in the new quarters a
sufficient additional income to make up for the cost.
Consequently the library will have to sacrifice some
thing for the mere sake of making an experiment. Â¦â¢ It
might have to sell many of its most valuable books
books that have a permanent worth â for of course
nothing could be raided by offering novels and other
common books for ?ale. Thus there would be at once
a lo?s to the libraries of the city that would be suf
ficiently serious to amounttto a genuine sacrifice.
San Francisco is the only considerable city in the
United States that has not a great library. To that
extent we are behind our age and our country. Con
sequently there is a deep public interest felt in even'
proportion relating to the Mercantile and to the
Mechanic' Institute libraries. It will be a glad day 5
for the people and an auspicious day for our culture
wncn*thÂ« trustees in charge of the two institutions
spree to arrange for their combination into one great
library of which the whole city will be proud, and
whnÂ«r excellence will be sufficient to prompt liberal
men to enme forward and erect a building worthy of
housing it.
ONE of the most gratifying features of this cam
paign is the renomination by the Republicans
of California of so many members of the pres
ent House of Representatives. The lack of expe
rienced Congressmen at has been one of
the chief reasons why California interests have not
received more attention from the Federal Govern
ment, and why our livers and harbors remain com
paratively unimproved. It is evident that Republi
cans at least have learned 'the right lesson from the
experience of the past, and that hereafter they will
rcnominate and do their best to re-elect members of
the House who have proven their fitness for the po
sition and their fidelity to the service of their con
stituents.
Among the Representatives thus renominated is the
Hon. Victor H. Metcalf, the present membet of the
House from the Third District. No member better
merits a re-election, for none has a record during his
first term of better service to his party, his State and
his constituents.
Mr. Metcalfs career in the House has been short,
but he has already made a marked impression upon
the more influential members of that body. When the
question of his renomination was under consideration
Speaker Henderson, who was then on a visit to Cali
fornia, said: "It seems impossible that there should
be any doubt of Mr. Metcalfs return. It would be a
very great mistake not to return him to Congress.
Mr. Metcalf is an earnest, conscientious, intelligent
and untiring worker. California has never sent to
the Congress of the United States, within my recol
lection, a man who in his first term has achieved
such an enviable standing as has Mr. Metcalf, and it
will be unfortunate not only for the Third Congres-.
sional District but for the State of California if he
be not returned."
An equally eloquent testimony to Mr. MetcalFs
efficiency as a Congressman was borne at the same
time by the Hon. Smith McPherson of Iowa, who
served during the last session with Mr. Metcalf and
worked with him on committees. Mr. McPherson
said: ' "I know of no man in Congress who worked
haj-der or was more untiring in his efforts than was
Mr. 'Metcalf in standing by President McKinley and
by that Republican policy which has brought this
country out of the slough of despond into the sun
shine of prosperity that now prevails."
Speaking of his own experience in the House Mr.
McPherson said: "I learned while in Congress that
a man of experience there can do ten times more ser
vice for his section than can a new member."
Every measure affecting the interests of the Pacific
Coast engaged the attention of Mr. Metcalf. enlisted
his sympathies and aroused his energies. While de
voted to the great Republican policies which tend to
the welfare of the whole country, he did not overlook
even the slightest of those bills which affect his own

WILLIAM E. ENGLISH.
Indianapolis, Ind.. Sept. 19. 1900.
OUR JUDICIAL TICKET.
rlYE Judges of the Superior Court are to be
elected in this county. Candidates for the office
have been nominated by the Republican and by
the Democratic parties. It now remains for the voters
tc make choice among the candidates and to cast their
ballots for those whom they believe best fitted for the
position.
As was announced yesterday, The Call recommends
the election of Max Sloss, William R. Daingerfield,
William P. Lawlor and J. V. Coffey for the full term
and Frank H. Kerrigan for the short" term. Some of
these have been nominated by the Republican con
vention and some by the Democratic convention, but
in the choice of Judges party politics should count for
nothing. It is true the openly asserted domination of
Kelly reflects discredit upon the Republican conven
tion, but even that should not blind the people to the
fact that some excellent men have accepted places on
the ticket, nor should it lead the # voters to do injustice
to such men.
The Call stands for honesty in politics and for jus
tice to all. It has determined to support for each
office the candidate who it believes will most worth
ily perform such duties as are imposed by the office to
which he aspires. It aims to be fair and to serve the
best and fullest interests of the community.
Under no circumstances should the selection of
Judges be made a matter of partisan prejudice or bias.
Since our Judges are elected by the people, it is neces
sary that they be nominated by some assembly of citi
zens, and custom has established that the nomination
l>y made by party conventions. The custom is one of
convenience merely 3nd shouid not affect the judg
ment of any intelligent voter. There is no such thing
as Republican policy or Democratic policy on the
bench. The duties required of a Judge are those
Â¦which can be fulfilled only by men whose minds are
jubiect to no bias of any kind, but who with absolute
impartiality can faithfully administer the law and make
the court a temple of inviolate justice.
Such being the ca<e. no claim of party loyalty can
be made upon the voter to induce him to vote for a
candidate for a judicial position. Where the bench <i
concerned all citizens are bound to divest their mind-;
of partisan considerations and to give support only
to those candidates who will best and most faithfully
protect the rights of all litigants before the courts.
The citizen who permits his vote for a candidate for a
judgeship to be determined by any other consideration
than that of seeking to make secure the honor and
integrity of the courts will be false to one of the high
est responsibilities of citizenship.
The Call practices what it preaches. Recognizing
that no citizen should be moved by party politics in
the choice of men for judicial office, it will not itself
be subject to such partisanship. The Call is a Repub
lican newspaper. It is for protection, for sound
money, for the McKinley administration and for Con
gressmen who will uphold Republicanism upon every
iÂ«ue. It will not. however, support for a judicial
office a man who has no other claim upon the place
than that of having been nominated by a Republican
County Convention. Consequently the judicial
ticket which The Call sustains is one fairly and hon
estly entitled to the support of all voters, no matter
to what party they belong.
HUMAN RIGHTS.
THE president of the Wells-Fargo Express in a
recent eructation for Bryan has declared with
the solemnity of a Bunsby that "there are mat
ters of greater moment than. money or trade, vz ,
human rights." We are curious to know whether
this modern Pecksniff had in view the right of poor
mortals to be exempt from the extortions of tax
shirking corporations when he fulminated this r e
markable declaration.
Ever since the imposition of the war tax the express
trust has successfully resisted its payment and saddled
this burden upon the shippers. The poor serving-girl
who desires to send 1 parcel to her family must con
tribute an extra penny in addition to the regu
lar charge to help out the express company. The
net profits of this Wells-Fargo Company, as shown
by its own statements, have been over a million dol
lars annually since the war tax was levied, and all
upon an original investment of only $500,000; and
still when the suit to settle the question as to whether
the shipper or the company should pay the tax came
up lately for hearing in the Supreme Court, after a
delay of years, the attorney for the company gravely
argued that it was the philosophy of all revenue laws
to make the consumer pay the tax and that it would
be unjust to throw the whole burden upon the ex
press companies of stamping the receipts instead of
distributing it among the shippers who stood in the
position of consumers.
This same express Don Quixote, when charging
the windmill of "imperialism" in an attempt to rally
the workingmen for Bryan, also declares: "And yet
there is an all-sufficient salvation. The laboring man
is a citizen and a voter, and the wage-earners, as a
whole, are numerous Â»nough to decide the election."
And he winds up with the startling announcement, "I
shall vote for Mr. Bryan," so putting himself in the
line of laboring men.
Let us examine the record of this president, of a
member of the express trust, in the light of a wage
earner. It is a notorious fact that the employes of
Wells-Fargo are very poorly paid, and it is understood
that this is due to the economic views of the presi
dent, who has full control of this subject. A canvass
among them shows that the drivers and freight hand
lers get from $20 to $60 a month, those working in the
auditing department from $15 to $60, and the clerks
generally from $30 to $00 a month. The president
and a few officials and high-priced attorneys who
fight off the war tax are better paid. The president
draws the modest salary of $25,000 a year.
It is related that during the hard times of 1893 and
1894, when he was earning his salary by writing
up the gold standard, there was a question about the
earnings of the .Wells-Fargo Company being suf
ficient to keep up the dividends to stockholders, and
to avoid this calamity and the possible loss of his po
sition Wage-earner Valentine issued an order for a
cut in the wages of ill the employes, ranging from
10 to 20 per cent, and announced with a great flourish
that his salary would be included in this cut; but
soon after he recouped by having himself elected
president, with a salary of $5000 1 year, of a bank in
Portland which was controlled by the express com
pany, and he held this sinecure place and drew this
$5000 salary, in addition to that from the express
company, for several years and until the bank be
came insolvent under his administration, when the
stock was sold out for assessments and bought in by
the express company, leaving a total loss of their in
â¢vestment to the outsiders. The bank is now run as
a branch of Wells, Fargo & Co. All this came out
lately in the trial of. a suit at Portland brought by
some of the outside stockholders against the corpora
tion to recover the value of their stock, and claiming
that it was sold illegally and in furtherance of a
scheme by the express company to freeze them out.
When that bank collapsed the wage-earning president
had the subservient board of directors of the express
company increase his salary $5000 a. year as president
of that company, and in this way he co-operated with
the other employes of the company in a reduction of
wages. What a shining example for the laboring
man to follow! Herein may we look for the practical
operation of an "ail-sufficient salvation."
There is a funny story now in circulation that a
year or more ago the late Collis P. Huntington
gently took this wage-earning president in hand and
suggested that he might perhaps the better earn his
salary by devoting his time to the affairs of the ex
press company and permit the national administration
to look after the General Government, at the. same
time hinting that a vacation of a few months wouM
enable him to drop out of the public gaze and then,
return quietly to his duties; that the wage-earner
took the hint and a vacation of eight or ten months,
not forgetting to draw his salary meanwhile, and
finally came back from Europe and remained quiet
as a mouse until the death of Huntington, when he
immediately began to belch for Bryan. Curiosity is
now excited to see whether the next president of the
Southern Pacific will put another bridle upon this
wage-earner or give him a permanent vacation.
When Mayor Phelan consented to become Willie's
sandwich-man his Honor probably had no suspicion
that the yellow sheet would begin to lash him as soon
as he placed himself in his self-erected pillory.
LEADING INDIANA DEMOCRAT
COMES OUT FOR McKINLEY
Captain William E. English, the Son of Han
cock's Running Mate, tiuits the
Democratic Party.
Captain William E. English, one of the most prominent citizens
of Indianapolis, has abandoned Democracy and Bryanism and has coma
out for McKinley and Roosevelt.
This conversion is regarded as especially significant, as Mr. Eng
lish has not only been a lifelong Democrat, but represents the ideas of
thousands of old-line Democrats in the State. He is the son of William
H. English, who for many years was a leading Democrat in Indiana
and was the Democratic candidate for Vice President on the Hancock
ticket in 1880.
Captain English succeeded to his father's prominence In the party.
He was elected a mmber of Congress from the Indianapolis district
on the Democratic ticket, and twice represented the district in Demo
cratic national conventions. Throughout the State he was recognized as
on* of the .party leaders who always took an active interest in poli
tics. At the breaking out of the war with Spain he was given a com
mission as captain and served in Cuba, being at San Juan and Santiago.
Since the war he has retired from the army and is now living in In
dianapolis.
râ DITOR San Francisco Call: Being
I radically and earnestly opposed to
I â¢ the principles of the Populist party,
I row in practical control of the
I present Democratic organization, I
cannot support any man or set of men
who stand upon the Kansas City platform
of 1900. The principles enunciated in those
Popullstle declarations of political faith
are, in my opinion, unsafe, unwise and
unpatriotic, hurtful in their present effect
and 1 dangerous to the future welfare and
prosperity of the country.
In the eloquent words of the great
Charles Sumner, delivered at a trying
period of his political history, "there are
matters legitimately within the range of
expediency and compromise, but the ques
tions now before the country are of an
other character. These questions will not
admit of compromise. The questions arc
not within. the range^of expediency. To
be wrong on these questions is to be
wholly wrong."
Upon these great questions, in consid
eration of which nerther compromise nor
expediency can legitimately hold a place
and upon which to be wrong "is to be
wholly wrong," I take my position indi
vidually for the right as it is given me to
see the right, and as a free and untram
meled voter, with no personal interests to
be affected except such as affect every
other good and loyal citizen
The demagogue's well-worn cry of
"trust" or "monopolist" has no terrors for
me, as I am In no way engaged in the
business of money lending, hold no mort
gages for money loaned and own no stock
whatsoever in any bank, insurance com
pany, railroad, trust, monopoly, corpora
tion or combination.
I have at all times teen in opposition
to the unsafe financial policy which the
autocrat of Lincoln, Nebr., made the
"paramount issue" of the campaign by
forcing its adoption on the Kansas City
convention over the wishes of the major
ity of the delegates themselves, and by
refusing, as is alleged, to be a candidate
unless it was incorporated in the plat
form. In this we have our first and only
known example of the real American
"imperialist" in the full exercise of his dic
tatorial powers. This was the paramount
issue created by the Nebraskan majesty
himself, and is understood to have been
the only one which he personally and au
tocratically demanded from his humble
subjects. After his edict In this regard
had been abjectly obeyed, with that
graceful condescension which sometimes
sways and unbends the most imperial of
rulers, he graciously permitted the con
vention to select for itself a second "para
mount issue" upon which to go before the
country, and has since in his speech of

UTTERANCE
State. Senator Foster of Washington, who noted his
efforts on behalf of Pacific Coast interests, such as
checking Japanese immigration and similar matters,
said of him: "He worked not. only in the interest of
California but of the entire Pacific Coast; he was
strong and influential with all parties, notwithstand
ing the fact that he was serving his first term."
With a record of such eminent service and with
such a reputation in Congress achieved in a single
session, Mr. Metcalf deserves the vote not only of all
Republicans but of all sound-money Democrats and
of all independents who wish to ?ce California repre
sented at Washington by a delegation which will ad
vance her prestige at the national capital to its right
ful position. The voters. of the Third District owe it
to the State to re-elect Mr. Metcalf, for if a Congres
sional career be opened for him by his constituents
he will soon command the chairmanship of an impor
tant committee and take rank among the most influen
tial of the younger Republican leaders of the House.
TO the workingman who had no wages at all in
1896 Bryan says that what he gets now ought
to be increased. To the one who is earning more
now than in 1896 he says that he should be earning
more than he is. He tells the farmer that he is -not
getting enough for his wheat and the laborer that he
already pays too much for his bread.
Touring Republican States he arraigns the rate 01
wages and attempts to make his hearers believe that
in some way it is fixed by President McKinley, and
that if he is elected President he will raise that rate.
Of course by parity of reasoning he will double the
price of wheat to the farmer and give bread to the
laborer at half its present price. He is doing the
Jack Cade to perfection. Jack promised his followers
that every pint pot should hold two pints, and Bryan
believes in that kind of pint pottery in politics.
He has plunged into the politics of' the coal strike
and is trying to coin it into votes. His political theory
being that society must build on its diseases and its
failures, he goes where its diseases are, not to heal,
but to increase them. If President, what could he do
to raise wages in Pennsylvania? Let him descend
from hyperbole, quit riding the air on metaphor and
submit a bill of particulars of the measures he will
take as President to raise wages in Pennsylvania. If
he can prove that he as President can raise wages, it
is evident that President McKinley can raise wages,
and Bryan's speeches on the subject are therefore
legitimate. If he cannot prove that the President of
the United States can raise wages in Pennsylvania,
then his speeches are false, infamous and the work of
a mischief-maker and demagogue.
But are there no low wages elsewhere than in
Pennsylvania? Is labor downtrodden only in the
States that Colonel Bryan is trying to persuade into
his camp? What wages are paid in the States that he
does not have to persuade? What are the relations of
capital and labor in the States which are already for
Bryan, where he need not put his magnetism on the
market nor void his orator}' to get votes?
In Mississippi and largely throughout the South the
average wage of farm labor is $6 per month. Even
the coolies in Hawaii are paid $14.
At $6 per month a man earns $72 per year. That is
20 cents a day.
If Mr. Bryan become President does he intend to
set his highly approved wage-raising yeast in Missis
sippi also? If so he should go down there and re
buke his devoted supporters for paying $6 a month
wages. It is an easy task for him to stand up and
denounce his political enemies in the North for pay
ing $20 a month to labor. That takes no courage.
It is probably true that if the wage were $100 a month
he would denounce them for not paying $200.
His trick in politics is to spread among men war
against each other and discontent with existing con
ditions, no matter what their improvement upon what
preceded them. If men who were marching five years
ago in the ranks of Coxey's tatterdemalions are now
petting $20 a month they are at least that much better
off. We heartily wish them success in getting five
times better off than they are now. But they are not
to be bettered by Bryan's oratory, by the lure he holds
out to them, by his promises which he never can per
form. His success is far more likely to re-enlist them
with the bold and redoubtable Captain Coxey, to hit
the highway again with bare heels and terrify the
country through which they march.
But Bryan is going to raise wages in Pennsylvania/
He is going to give us dear wheat and cheap bread.
But what is he going to do for the $6 a month wage
workers in the Democratic State of Mississippi?
He attacks the trusts for not raising wage* as fast
as prices have risen. But Mississippi cotton has risen
ico per cent, and wages stand at $6. Even if raised
with cotton a man's monthly wage would be no for
tune. Can't Mr. Bryan go down South and get his
widely known and justly celebrated handspike tongue
under wages and raise them above $6?

the corner of Folsom and Bteuart streets.
The Harbor Republican Club Is now one

Harbor Commissioners Meet.
Captain George Scott of the pilot ser
vice has Ix-en heard from. He was carried
away on the British fhip Flintshire dur
ing Sunday's northwester and It was
feared that he might have to make the
long voyage to Cork. He has turned up
at Ventura, however, and is coming
home on the tank steamer George Loomis.
Some people say that Captain Scott is
largely Interested In the oil fields and
that is why he took advantage of the
northwester to land In ti.e center of the
oil region. It is more than likely, how
ever, that Captain Scott headed the Flint
shire inshore on the first opportunity and,
sighting the George Loomis or some other
coasting Eteamc-r. hoisted a signal of dis
tress and was taken oft. He ia expected
home to-day.

The Kenilworth left Philadelphia 13S
days ago and while that is a fairly good
passa-ge It 1b not to oe compared with the
run Captain Taylor made last year. Off
the Horn some terrible weather was en
countered. It was bitterly cold and the
ropes froze In the blocks and the water
in the pipes. The water in the tanks was
caked with Ice and in some instances
frozen solid. Besides this a driving sleet
struck the men In the face whl'.e they
were at work and some of them narrowly
escaped being frost-bitten.
In latitude 15 north a sudden Bqua.ll
carried the Kenilwnrth's main royal
mast away. On May 81. In latitude 22
degr. So min. north, longitude 37 deg. M

is supposed, was the Kaiulani. now over
140 days out from New York. It will be
remembered that the Kaiulani started
from New York man: 1 months affo and
got partially dismasted In a sale. She
not back to her home port and after be

proached her and offered a tow, but the
captain said r.o. He could gain nothing
by towir.g In, as there is not a spare
berth on the front. The big ship lay at
her anchorage until late in the morning
and then when a breeze came up her sails
were shook out and she came slowly up

causing couKhJr.R. sneczinp. jrapging an']
frequent clearings of the throat and head.
The usual treatment by local touches,
snuffs, calves, etc. often gives temporary
r^ii p f. but anythtns like a cure can only
b<Â» obtained by a treatment which removes
the catarrhal taint trom the blood and the
disappearance cf the Inflammation from
the mucous surfaces.
A new remedy which meets these re-
oiiire-m^nts and which so far ha* been re-
markably successful !n curing catarrh is
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
These tablets act upon the blood and
mucous membranes only. They can hard-
ly be called a i^ecret patent medicine as
they are composed of su^h valuable reme-
dies as SanRuinarla. HydraMIn, Eucalyp-
tol and similar cleansing antlsf-ptie?,
which cure by t-liminailr.g from the blood
and mucous surfaces the catarrha! poison.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are larpre.
pleasant tasting lozenges taken Internal-
ly allowing them to dissolve slowly in
the mouth: in this way they reach the
throat, fauces end the entire alimentary
canal. â
If de5ire<5 th<Â»y may also be d!Â«Â«o1ve<J In
water and used as a douche in addition to
the Internal use. but it is not at all necos-
H rj- to use a douche; a few of them dls-
poived in the mouth dally will be suffi-
cient. Howevr, when there is much
stoppage of the nose, a douche made from
thefÂ»e tablets will give immediate relief.
but the regular daily use internally of
thepe tablets will cure the whole catarrhal
trouble without resorting to the Incon-
venience of a douche.
Pr. B< Bient states "that the Internal
tr'Strne/ fr.r catarrh is rapidly tj<kinp
the place of the old plan of dmichinK and
local application, and further says that
probably the J*Â«st and certainly the safest
remedy at present on the market is
Ftuart's Catarrh Tablets, as no secret is
made of th^ir composition and all the
really efficient remedies for catarrh are
contained In this tablet." -,/ .
DruggiFtP pell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
at fifty cents for full-sized packages. Ask
vour drup^iKt and if he Is nonept he will
tell you there is no safer, more palatable,
more efficient and convenient remedy on
the market.
A Simple Remedy Whicli "Will Inter-
est Catarrh Sufferers.
In Its earlier stapes catarrh ie more of a
nuisance than a menace to the general
health, but sooner or later, the disease ex-
t*n<2s to the throat, bronchial tubes and
even to the storrach and intestines.
Catarrh If essentially a disease of the
mucous membrane, the local symptoms
being: a profuse discharge of mucus, stop-
page of the nostrils, Irritation In throat.
A DAILY NUISANCE.

Radomsky was tnken to the City Prison
pnd locked up. He made a further denial
that he had deliberately changed his tes
timony or had been offered any Induce
ment to do so. An investigation may^,de
tprmine who is right, the witness or the
District Attorney.
"The case looks plain to me," said As
sistant District Attorney Deuprey after
court had adjourned. "Tills man Ra
domsky has been carried from this court
to his home, 348 Fourth street, by one
Fltzpatrlek. a friend of McGlade. who
has plied him with liquor and succeeded
In making him change hia testimony, if
not to break down the prosecution's case
to at least reflect on his own credibility
ns a witness, which will ko a long way
toward saving McG'ade. Radoraslty was
employed by John Daughney, a foreman
under Superintendent of Streets Ambrose,
and was used by McGlade as a messenger
to cash the forged warrants on the treas
ury. He -was not a party tr> the crimes
committed by McGlade. but in his efforts
to assist him he Is now confronted with
a charge of p<Â»r.1ury. Ills arrest was made
with the object in view of proceeding
ogainst him on the charge named."*
Judge Burnett immediately ordered Ra
dom?ky into the custody of the Sheriff,
for what purpose Is not yet clear; but an
Investigation will result, even though
Radomsky is not charged with perjury.
"These two Irreconcilable statements of
this witness take on a eerlous aspect
when duly considered." said Deuprey,
"and should be investigated."
"No one has approached me," said the
witness. "I did not intend to mislead the
court, but I became excited and got con
fused as to the dates."
Attorney Lennon here took the witness.
"Has any one approached you or offered
you a consideration to change your tes
timony?" said Mr. Lennon.
"I believe this witness has Â¦willfully
chanered his statement," said Assistant
District Attorney Deuprey, "to meet the
requirements of the defense. Perjury has
certainly been committed, whether will
fully or not must be determined by inves
tigation."
"If 1 did I did not intend to say so,"
replied the witness. "I thought you were
referring to this order of September 16.
I was excited when I was on the stand
yesterday and became confused as to the
dates of the instruments."
District Attorney Byington sprang to his
feet and hurled a crossfire of questions at
the witness. "Did you not say on direct
examination that you received this order
of October 14 from Peter McGlade, and
did you not positively identify the order
when you were being examined in this
court yesterday?" demanded the District
Attorney.
"Yes, I am positive of that," Bald the
witness.

He asserted that to support the trusts
meant to support the Republican policies,
including militarism. Imperialism, high
tariff, etc. He took up and discussed
briefly the general Issues of the cam
paign. The speech was liberally applaud
ed In many places, and there were fewer
shouts for opposing candidates than at
most meetings.
Mr. Bryan was followed by Attorney
General Smyth, who received respectful
attention. He was followed by James
Hamilton Lewis, former 'Congressman
from the Etate of Washington, who made
a general political speech.
Mr. Bryan returned to Lincoln to-night.
He will start at 7 o'clock to-morrow
morning on a general tour of the country,

days before election.
factory brings no loss to the company,
but it does bring great loss to the* em
it an order comes from the head office
In New York to reduce the wages in all
the starch factories the men have nothing
to do but to submit. The game greed
which leads trusts to raise prices and ex
tort from consumers will allow It to lower
wages and to do injustice to the employes.
"The Attorney General is seeking to en
force a statute in Nebraska. The law Is
a rood law and ought to be enforced, ana
the people of Nebraska City ought to hold
a mass-meeting to commend him rather
than condemn him. The fusion forces be
lieve in enforcing both State laws and na
tional laws against the trusts. The Kan
eas City platform demands the annihila
tion of all private monopolies.
"If the United States Attorney General
of the Republican party had done his
duty he would have been enforcing this
law instead cf Mr. Smyth being down
here to-night doing what the Republican
National Attorney General should do.
This Republican administration has
brought just three suits during the laEt
three years, and yet more trusts have
been organized during the last three years
than during the history of the country. I
want you people to understand that if we
get hold of this Government the Federal
administration as well as the State ad
ministration will lay its hand upon the
starch trust."

On cross-examination Radomsky became
confused and was ordered to return yes
terday morning for further examination.
Another order bearing date of September
1C was presented to the witness. This he
identified as one cashed by him. When
handed over for cross-examination Attor
ney Lennon, who represents the accused,
asked the witness which of the orders he
received first. He said he received that
of September 16 first and the one of later
date at about the time of its execution.
â¢1 received that of September 16 from
Peter McGlade and that of October 14
from Edward McGlade," said the witness.
"Are you sure you received the order of
October 1* from Edward McGlade and
not in the presence of this defendant?"
said Attorney Lennon.
The new sensation was injected Into the
trial Just before noon yesterday. On di
rect examination the day before Ra
domsky testified that he received an order
from McGlado dated October 14, 1S9S,
which he cashed with Belr & Regensber
ger, the brokers. The money, he said, he
gave to Edward McGlade, a brother of
the accused. lie did not know whether or
not this money was subsequently paid
over to the accused. This order on which
the money was paid by the brokers reads:
No. 8335. BAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14. 189S.

Deputy Superintendent of Streets.
A CRY that the Jury had been tam
pered with was raised by the
prosecution during- the last trial
of Peter W. McGlade on a charge
of forgery. This cry resulted in
the verdict of "guilty as charged" be
ing set aside. Yesterday the prosecu
tion tossed a new sensation into the Mc-
Glade proceedings, in progress before
Judge Burnett of Sonoma County, sitting
for Judge Cook, by inferentlally charg
ing against the prisoner the further crimo
of suppression of witnesses and suborna
tion of perjury. In consequence the pros
ecution's main witness, J. R. Radomsky.
Is In Jail, a prisoner of the Sheriff. On
the one hand It is claimed that Radomsky
is in Jail with the sole object In view of
keeping him sober, that his attendance
lri court may be assured. On the other it
is claimed that he Is being held pending
proceedings against him on a charge of
perjury committed on the stand during
the McGlade trial. A third theory Is that
he will be kept behind bars "that he may
be kept out of reach of McGlatfe's
friends."
NEBRASKA CITY. Xeb.. Sept. 26.â
William J. BrysJi spoke here to a large
crowd to-nigrht. The speech had been
looked forward to with much Interest
because Mr. Bryan had announced that
hÂ«Â» would deal with the trust Question as
effected by the suit Instituted by Attorney
General Smyth to annul the sale of the
Arpo Starch Works of this city to the
National Starch Company. popularly
fcnotvn as the "Starch Trust."
There wore not many unfriendly Inter
ruptions, but evidently some had been ex
pected, for previous to the meeting the
Mayor of the city lÂ«sue<3 an order, saying
that th^re had bees rumors of trouble and
vurr.ing against it. The meeting was
held in the Courthouse grounds and the
peojMe stood under the trees and much of
the time in the rain. Mr. Bryan plunged
Into the local trust question at the very
beginning of his speech. He gave a his
tory of the Argo Manufacturing Com
pany, quoting copiously from the Ne
braska City Conservative, published by
ex-Secretary cf Agriculture J. Sterling
Morton. The company, according to the
Conservative of May 25. 1S99. competed
successfully in America and Europe with
the ftarch trust. "Nebraska City," said
the Conservative, "in its cereal mills and
Argo factory has two successful plants
which no tru=t has as yet been able to
buy. bully or wheedle."
About Septemer 1. 1S99, the Argo Com
rar.y joined the Unlte-J Starch Company.
a Now Jersey corporation formed for the
ostensible purpose of fighting the National
Starch Company. Finally in August or
September. IK"), the National Starch Com
pany absorbed the United Starch Com
pany. Mr. Bryan continued:
"First. v,e have an independent com
j-.any. growing and prospering upon Its
own merits; second, tills independent
company joins other companies to I'ght
the starch trust, and third, this independ
ent company, with its associates, Joins
the Ftarch trust and competition is at last
destroyed.
"It the people of Ne-braska City defend
the starch trust they must be prepared to
defend all the other trusts, for it Is impos
sible for them to destroy trusts located
elsewhere and defend a trust located In
their city. The people of Nebraska City
are more interested in the dissolution of
the starch truÂ«t than the people of other
parts of the State. When the Argo Com
pany was independent it wa.s controlled
f>y citizens of Nebraska <*ity and Ne
braska City Interests cot:ld be considered
by its management. But if the National
Starch CoattUWT, with headquarters in
New Vork. is allowed to absorb this In
dustry the. control will be removed from
Nebraska City to New- York and the
wishes and interests of ..he people of Ne
braska City will have little consideration.
"The people of your "own have already
seen a distillery closed down by the
â¢whisky trust. What is to prevent the
Argo Company from being closed down
by the starch trust? When all the fac
tories belong to one corporation the clos
iiip down cf one factory does not bring
lo^s to the corporation, because the work
CH.n be carried on somewhere else. The
Arpro Company, as an independent com
pany, could not afford to close down and
turn off its employes, but when the Argo
Comrar.y becomes a member of the Na
tional Starch I'ompany-the employes have
no way of protecting themselves, because
the work bera can be suspended while the
employes are starved into submission.

CONV
Strong Words of Praise From a
Grateful Patient.
Dr. DeFord's Intermediate Homeopathic Remedies stand for the
people against the candy sugar pill fallacy and the strong drug and nos-
trum treatment. ,
TABLETS, STRONG DRUGS
AND NOSTRUMSâ Dangerous
mixtures of mercury, calomel,
quinine and acids and other
Injurious drugs, prepared by
those Ignorant of the science
of medicine. Cure-alls that
produce & half-dozen diseases
In the effort to curÂ« one.
Nauseous, poisonous, health
and life destroying â act on all
the tissues of the body, healthy
and diseased alike. No more
eulted for the human system
than an ox yoke for a pony.
Far behind modern methods of
medicine and rapidly being
discarded and relegated to tha
past by Intelligent physicians
and people everywhere.
ALL OTHER HOMEO-
PATHIC REMEDIESâ White
sugar pills, tasteless and odor-
less. No physical, physiolog-
ical or chemical evidence of
medicine, defying all means
known to science to discover
the presence of' anything ex-
cept sugar. Made to sell, not
to cure. A baby can eat a
bottle of themâ they do no
harm, they do no good. Let
your disease run onâ a waste
of time so precious to the sick.
Of 40 of these "so-called" rem-
ftales no one can be distin-
guished from the other, except
by the labels on the bottles.
They are a fraud and a fal-
lacy pure and simple.
DR. DeFORD'S INTER-
MEDIATE HOMEOPATHIC
REMEDIESâ Each remedy has
Its distinguishing Individual-
ity, as to taste, color, odor
'and medicinal effect. Scien-
tific Investigation has proven
them each to be responsive to
physiological' and chemical
testa and highly medicinal In
action. They act only on dis-
eased, structures and not on
the healthy tissues, therefore
are cafe, reliable and suitable
for young or old. Easy to
take, no guessing, no delay,
no experiment, no faith, no
poisonous, nauseous doses. The
relief Is Instant, the cure cer-
tain, quick and permanent.
Each one Is a specific pre-
pared (or one disease and not
"cure alia." The only TRUE
Homeopathlo Remedies, the
only rational remedies known
to mankind.

Dr. DeFord says: "I will devote my life to the education of the people
against sugar pill medicine, harmless yet fatally incompetent, and waste-

strong drugs and nostrums, that create a half-dozen diseases in the effort
to cure one."

NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â In his annual
report President Hill of the Great North
ern says that the growing Oriental trade
has already reached the point .where traf
fic is practically limited to the ships
which can be secured to carry the com
modities seeking an outlet to China and
Japan. Referring to the crop situation,
he says that in Minnesota and the Da
kotas not more than half a crop will be
marketed. This will reduce the earnings
of course, but Increases from other traffic
will eo far offset this reduction that the
company's income will not suffer mÂ«te
' Revenue freight tonnage hauled during
the year increased 15& per cent. The
number of bushels of wheat hauled east
bound decreased 1,022,643 bushels, or 80,980
tons. , ,
Earnings for the passengers Increased
22 per cent and. passenger mile revenue
7 2-3 per cent. This Increase is almost en
tirely due to higher rates on first and sec

principally second class.' Upon a con

Colonel Pavon Killed.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Sept. 26.â Late
last night Colonel Pavon of the Cuban
army was killed in the Cafe Comercio by
Octavio Mena, formerly a clerk in the
oflice of the captain of the port. Mena
and one of his companions were intoxi
cated and had been breaking furniture.
Colonel Pavon Intervened and a quarrel
ensued. Mena,. snatching the revolver of
one of his party, shot Pavon In the back
of the neck. The officer turned to face
his assailants and received two bullets In
the head, being Instantly killed. Pavon
was a tobacco merchant at Holguln.
Fren'ch. Bark Wrecked.
CORONEL, Chile, Sept. 26.â The French

24 for San Francisco, struck on a rock

torted or crinkled like cabbages and as
big as the sails of a windmill." Yet peo
ple of high degree persisted In wearing
them the Londoners contemptuously
terming the collar "the French ruff
while the Parisians invariably allilled to
It as "the English monster." Catherine
de Medici, who Introduced . the fashion,
imported from Italy a court ruff maker, to
whom she accorded the sole right of mak
ing these trappings. Her son Henry III,
having been trained from childhood with
a lively taste tor Italian affectations, be
came so punctilious about his ruffs that,
rather than see them limp and Irregular,
he Would launder and goffer both cuffs
and collars himself.
Men even more .than women adopted tne
wearing of luce, and thus contributed
largely to the making of designs of a dis
tinctly artistic character. Eventually lace
figured so largely in the enrichment of
court attire that not only great, flat col
lars, turned-back cuffs, doublets, gloves
and breeches were overloaded with cloudy
fabrics but even boots were so adorned.
What wonder that when Henry IV con
templated starting a silkworm nursery
his Minister, Sully, with Huguenot aus^
terity, exclaimed, "You want Iron and
soldiers, not laces and silks to trick out
fops!" The exaggerated use of laces
spread from articles of clothing .to fur
nishings beds, canopies, curtains, even
the windows of traveling coaches were so
enveloped with these priceless, filmy fab
rics that Henry IV passed sumptuary
edicts endeavoring to restrict the absurd
outlay upon "glltterlngs and gildings.
Nobles nevertheless continued to bring
themselves to bankruptcy in their efforts
to secure the greatest number of lace nov
elties, one courtier possessing nearly 400
lace-trimmed collars and cuffs. Louis
XIII therefore, etrove still more forcibly
to lessen extravagance by promulgating
a severe edict known as the "regulation
as to superfluity In costume."
Louis XIV. on the contrary, did all that
he could to develop the lace industry In
France. He sent lacemakers' daughters
to the Venetian convents for Instruction.
$>nd it was not long before the excellent
results were shown in the justly celebrat
ed "points de France," which, touched the
highest point possible to needlepoint laces.
The wild caprices,, in lacemaking which
distinguished succeeding reigns never sur
passed the truly artistic work achieved
: without regard to cost or trouble under
the protection of the gTand monarquo.
Thus, from a stiff, wiry-looking trim
ming lace, passing from stage to stage,
became more dainty and filmy In appear
ance, geometrically planned patterns giv
ing away to flower and stroll designs,
which in turn were superseded by grace
ful fantastic effects bordering upon real
istic representation. Machine-made lace
was brought to an advanced stage of per
fection during the latter part of thÂ«
eighteenth century, menacing pillow-made
lace more than needlepoint, which gained
the public favor and reached its artistic
climax in the early seventeenth century.
100 years before the bobbin lace enjoyed
the same degree of favor. Belgium,
through' Its trade with England, has in
fused this method with certain technical
characteristics never yet surpassed.
"While It would be quite Impossible to
study the many kinds of lace now 1 on the
market, there are certain wejl known
hand-made laces which will always be In
demand and which every Intelligent
woman should, therefore, recognize at
When Louis XIV Introduced the art of
Venetian" needlepoint Into the various In
significant lace centers of . France the
most brilliant results came from the
Alencon royal center, whose pacemakers
showed exceptional talent In adapting
themselves to the subtle developments In
troduced by the King's artists*. That
Alencon still holds herself worthy of her
illustrious past may. be inferred by com
paring illustrations ot the point d'Alencon
of the eighteenth ' and nineteenth cen
turies. .-

Bishop McPaul's Idea to Be
Carried Out by Clubs
and Societies.
NEW YORK. Sept. 26.â The Catholic
Young Men's National Union in' conven
tion to-day decided to form a federation
for the purpose of Influencing legislation
and furthering the claims of people who
embrace the Catholic faith.
Bishop McFaul's idea of a federation
of every Catholic club and society in the
United States, to be formed by tho ap
pointment of delegates to attend a mon
ster -mass-meeting of delegates from
every prominent club and society through
out the country to be held In New York
CiVy on Thanksgiving day, November 29,
was unanimously adopted by the conven
tion.' Committees were appointed to carry
the plan into effect.
Among the largest Catholic organiza
tions In the United States which are to
be embraced In the proposed federation of
Catholic clubs are the Knights of Colum
bus Knights of St. John, the Catholic
Benevolent Legion, the Ancient Order of
Hibernians the Irish Catholic Benevolent
Union, the Irish-German societies of
America, the Catholic Total Abstinence
Union of America ami the Catholic
Knights of America. Besides these or
ganizations there are scores of others of
less prominence.
FEDERATION OF
THE CATHOLICS
WASHINGTON'. Sept. 26.-The secretary
of the Chilean legation said to-day that
the reports of war between Chile and her
neighbors were groundless. The cause ol
the possible conflict is alleged to be the
unwillingness of Chile to conform to cer
tain treaty relations, it being contended
that Chile will not abide by the award
of the British Government in the boun
dary question wlth*the Argentine Repub
lic and that it refuses to submit the ques
tion of the definitive sovereignty over the
provinces of Tacna and Arlca to the de
cision of a popular plebiscite to be held
in those provinces according to a treaty
between Chile and Peru. In response to
these statements it Is now set forth by the
Chilean authorities that Chile is not try-
Ing to restrict the limits of the British
award and that she certainly will abide by
It. 'Chile does not refuse to submit the
question of sovereignty to a popular ple
biscite. And In general It Is stated that
"the diplomatic relations between Chile
and Argentina, Peruvian and Bolivian
governments are at present peaceful and
friendly."
As convincing proof of this the recent
report of the Chilean Minister of Foreign
Affairs is referred to. This contains the
statement that "our boundary question
with the Argentine Republic is now set
tled In a friendly manner and the rela
tions between both countries have been
cordial and sincere." The boundary ar
bitration Is still in progress and its de
termination will dispose of the only ques
tion pending between Chile and Argentina.
The Minister for Foreicn Affairs also
cites an agreement with Bolivia calculat
ed to prevent all disagreeable questions
and boundary Incidents which from time
to time have arisen.. In the discussion
with Peru both have shown a desire to
reach an early settlement and the steps
taken toward a satisfactory adjustment
are set forth. â¢ . Â»
At Present There Seems No
Danger of Conflict Over
Boundary Question.

Misfortune seems to have claimed the
Azzali Italian Opera Company for its own.
Aft^r a series of mishaps, which would
make a comedy of errors if there were not
too much of the tragic in the story, the
company was to have bejfun its engage
ment last night at the California Theater.
But it didn't, and /it seemed as If the
whole Latin quarter of the city was at the
doors' to utter imprecations, gesticulate
all sorts of disgust and leave thoroughly
disappointed.
The failure of the company to open its
engagement was no fault however of Its
own. The fates were again adverse and
Angelina Turconi-Bruni, who was to as-
Fume the soprano part in l/ucia. was re
ported seriously ill with a cold. There was
no help for it. She could not appear and
the management was forced to close the
doors and announce that the engagement
would not begin until Saturday night,
when "Aida" will be sung. It is hoped
that this will be the last misfortune for
the company, of which so much has been
written and which unquestionably Is
composed of capable artists.
T'ntoward incidents have marked the
course of tho company since its departure
from Italy. It was first reported ship
wrecked. .Then it had a nerve-racking,
voice-impairing journey to the City ot
Mexico. Unmusical customs officials kept
It two days in quarantine at El Paso and
when it arrived here with the announce

alarming discovery was made that the

Lace, that "most poetic of all textile
ilssilf-?." has the peculiar charm of in
tensifying the beauty which it seems to
veil. As u fantastic adjunct to dress it
has. therefore, appealed strongly to the
courts distinguished for their love of
personal decoration; and as it is of com
paratively modern development, having
come into vogue as late as the early six
teenth century, its history j. is easily
studied.
"I^acis." oa darned netting, and cut or
drawn threadwork are but the transitional
forms between embroidery and lacework
proper (so closely allied that one seems
but an ingenious variation of the other).
I.ace. in its perfected stage, differs from
embroidery which postulates a foundation
in that If is a textile fabric in Itself, both
pattern and ground being devised by the
lace-worker. Hand-made lace Is divisible
into two branches, named â from the
method of constructionâ needlepoint and
pillow lace-making. The former method
involves the employment of a needle which
loops a thread into various shapes and
patterns, thus creating a dainty, sculp
turesque effect of gentle relief. The other
method produces a softer blending of
ornamental effects by means of twisting
or braiding together a number of separat
ed threads wound around the heads of
lengthened bobbins and fastened In a row
upon the cushion or pillow which gives it
Its name. In Its original form it is closely
allied to the reticulated weaving or fringe
knotting of ancient peoples. In its pre
sent form it ts said to have been invented
in the Netherlands, where it is still one
of the chief Industries.
The art of lace-making has been follow
ed by women of all classes, providing a
graceful pastime for court ladles and an
additional sustenance for the peasants.
200 000 of whom in France to-day eke out
a livelihood by this means. As early us
the fifteenth century various complicated
stitcheries, interlacing devices and de
signs for indented borders were eagerly
sought after; and when the art of engrav
ing and modes of printing made it possible
for books of needlework patterns to su
persede the samplers, which had been in
sufficient to meet the demand, laee-mak
lng became a specialized industry and as
sumed a more Independent individuality.
Fashion through the introduction of the
Medici collar into the French court, soon
stimulated the making of lace edges in
large quantities. In spite of poetic satire
and slighting prose, men and women con
tinued to wear these curious stiffened col
lars some of which were a quarter of a
yard deep, with twelve lengths in each
triple-staged ruff, all edged with narrow
lace. Contemporary writers stigmatized
them as "gadrooned like organ pipes. con-
the French schools arc elassed under the
general head of guipure* de Venise. Or
iginally the term guipure implied a fili
gree work stiffened with a Ktmp or wire.

ed to all laces made with bars which dis
tinguished them from thos" having small
meshes classified as "dc-nttlles." Th*
finished crispness and firmness of outline
of th" Venetian suipiinfs were attained
by.casMng minute stitches over hnrsehtir.
It is said that OOCÂ« when the lacomaker.i
of Venice were striving to make f->r LOOM

surpass in marvelous delicacy all previous
specimens of their handiwork they w?rÂ«
not satisfied with the fineness of the or.'.i

guipure Is in Auvergne. Here more th.in

ters in the world. During the greater part
nf thist century they have been making
rich black guipure of heavy silk thread.
Probably the French lace most widely
known, because of its plentiful imitation.
Is that of Valenciennes, made In thÂ«
French town of that name glnce the fif
teenth century. It did not. however, ac
quire a. distinctive appellation until the
eighteenth cenftiry and has not been made
in Valenciennes since the Revolution. Tha
style of lace always identified with thi*
name Is. now made in a "small frontier
town of France, where a museum of lace*
has been established. Valenciennes lac*
Is also made In two provinces in Belgium,
where convent glrlu, spinsters nn<l widow*
form themselves into lace-making com
munities. This lace 1Â« one of the oldest
pillow-made laces and 13 distinguished by
a softness and flatness formed by very
regularly plaited meshes of the same kind
of thread used in the floral design. It is
differentiated from Mechlin, a ptllow
made lace very popular in England, be
causo of a similar lightness and pleasing
effect, by the lack of cordonnets or out
lining' threads. The absence Â¦ of any
Â¦ threadwork in thÂ«Â» nature of relief renders
: Valenciennes lace particularly flexible an-1
suitable for laundering. For these reasons
It was particularly prized for the lingerie
of the great ladies of the eighteenth cen
tury.
Another l.ic*Â» very popular in France.
Brussels point or point d'Angleterre, was
made In Flanders and sold in Dr.glano.
The English so greatly appreciated the
Flemish Iaees that for a ttmÂ«=" they mo
nopolized the wearing of them and ex
pended such immense sums upon foreign
point that Parliament was obliged to pass
sumptuary laws protecting the manufac
ture of English bone lace and prohibiting
the importation of foreign lacef. ThÂ»>
court of Charles U immediately proceeded
to evade this edict by smuggling In the
richest laces in the Belgian market under
the name of English point, an appellation
coined for the purpose. The Flemish lace
workers Invited to settle in England
were not able to produce a fine quality of
lace because they could not secure tho
necessary flax, so the point was thereafter
made in Brussels under the English namÂ».
Th% Invention of machines for making
fine nets gave in 1SC0 a new Impulse to tht;
application of floral ornament upon tulle.
In this way shawls' and bridal veils of
great beauty could be made at a com

tions of the Brussels pillow-made applica
tions are obtained by a combination with
needlepoint. Equally popular among the
modern Belgian laces 13 the Duchesse

"President of Yale. D.D., LT>.

the innocent party to contract a second

KLONDIKE'S OUTPUT
' Â¦; UFOR THE PAST SEASON
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.â Some Inter
esting facts regarding the situation at
Dawson City contained in the report
of Consul J. C. McCook. under date of
August 22. He says there has been an
abundance of wild" blueberries, currants,
raspberries and cranberries this summer.
The cattle herders on the hill and a few
Indians gather the berries and bring them
to Dawson, receiving $1 to $1 50 per quart.
The idea of building an Ice plant in
Dawson seems like "carrying coals to
Newcastle." The lack of ice in summer,
however, has been seriously- felt and a
contract has been given for an ice ma
chine to be placed in a cold storage ware
house. The cost of Ice this Bummer has
been five cents per pound, or at the rate
of $100 per ton.
Consul McCook says more mining claims
have been worked this summer than in
any other season, because the heavy
rainfall has afforded sufficient water for
sluicing. Machinery is now found every
where in the district and no One thinks ot
working a claim without boiler, engine
and pumps. The amount of gold sent out
this season, as per Consular and invoices
is $12,500,000. It is possible that a quarter
of a million more has gone | out without
any record.

"DAINTY FOOD"
Turns Pale Cheeks to Pink.
Our best physicians of the present day
seek to cure patient* by the useof food,
Tather than heavy drugs, and this is the
true method, for all physicians agree
that only from food can the body be
rebuilt.
Many people fail to give their physi-
cians credit, for alter living on poorly
selected or badly cooked food for a long
time, perhaps, and when their ailments
become chronic they expect the Doctor,
Â¦vith Â«omc magic potency, to instantly
rebuild them. >" -
This is not possible. The only true
ir.ethod is to turn as quickly as can
be from poor food to good. A young
lady. Miss Alice Hendricks, employed
at the corner of Fourth and Race
streets. Cincinnati, O., says: "I was
variously treated for my nerves, mus-
cles, lungs, etc.. but none of the treat-
ment gave me relief from the pains.
"About a year ago my appetite failed
completely and I began to have sinking
spells fimilar to fainting. Then I took
nil manner of tonics and stimulants, but
they were of no effect. I had been
brought to quit drinking coffee and
taking Postum Food Coffee in its place,
and gradually began to get a little
better.
"Some one fujieested that if I found
Poftum Food Coffee so beneficial I had
better ufc Grape-Xuts food, as they
were both the children of one brain.
1 commenced on Grape-Xuts food for
breakfast, having Postum Food Coffee
with it. I found the food so dainty, de-
licious and appetizing that I always
looked forward to breakfast with pleasV
t:rr. â¢
"Shortly after commcncinc: this diet
K'~iv wretched pain in the side was creat-
"*iy" improved, .and now. a year later, it
lias gone entirely, also the sinking
Â«pelh: in fact, my pale cheeks have
changed to pink, I have trained back
rr.nre than the twenty pounds I lost.
and am thoroughly well in every way."

Music is the poetry of sound. The song

no one could go to dinner without a fear
ful noise of gongs and bells, but peopla
seem to know now when it Is time to eat.
No bell calls us to the theater, why should

â¢The gold brick swindle," says a busi
ness man, "is onÂ© of the most plausible
propositions ever advanced, and has land
ed some of the cleverest business men in
the country. Twenty years ago It used
to be a common thing for banks In tho
"West to buy gold bricksâ I mean real
ones â and frequently there were the best
of reasons for keeping: tho transactlou
quiet It often happened that the owner
of some partly developed mlno would
make an unexpected strike and wish to
buy up the adjacent property. Naturally,
he would want t6 hold back the news of
his discovery until he secured thÂ© land,
and. If he had any bullion to dispose of,
would make the sale as quietly as possi
ble. The banks became accustomed to
deals of that kind, and were, consequent
ly, pretty easy prey for the gold brick
swindler who turned up with a precisely
similar story. I don't oelleve I exagger
ate when I say that fully one-third of all
the banking houses in thÂ© Western min
eral belt were at some time victimized by
this game." â New Orleans Times-Demo

BOSTON, Sept. 26.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter to-morrow will say: While
consumers of wool have manifested most Inter
est In the market since our Jast report their
buying is still of the hand-to-mouth character.
They are very particular to keep in close touch
with the market, being evidently aware that
their necessities may at any time be such as
to compel them to buy more liberally and they
are anxious to know Just what they can do.
Prices are pretty steadily held, although now
and then slight concessions are heard of. In the
West there Is no evidence of any concession
among holders of wool, and In consequence
very little wool Is moving from the Interior.

CHICAGO. Sept. 26.â October wheat opened
a shade down at 76\QTG7-sc. with a Bale also
made at 7SHc, almost at the tap of tho gong.
This slight exhibition of uneasiness was due to
better weather In the Northwest. During the
two previous sessions, however, most of the
weak bulls had been forced out and the talent
was in a position to buy. In this they were
encouraged by the strength developed by corn,
comparative steadiness at Llveri>ool and indi
cations of diminishing receipts. Later in tho
day the weak state of the ocean freight rates
caused anticipations of export business and
caused a still further advance. October ad
vanced with few reactions to 78c. On profit
taking the market reacted, but closed firm, %@

Hay is very rtlff, and dealers are disposed to
p-ush the market up. A car of extra choice
wheat sold at $13 50, but this figure is above
the market as yet. Further advances are
looked for. The transports and ships chartered
by the Government are taking away large
quantities, and the local demand is good, as the
retailers have at last come to the conclusion
that there Is not a great deal of good Hay ob
tainable.

DEAR SIR: It is with pleasure we acknowledge the correctness
of the daily market reports, as* published in The Call and the absolute
fairness with which all matters pertaining to the fruit industry are
treated in that department.
To such an,extent are. we believers in the accuracy of the reports
that when asked by outsiders for daily price currents we usually an-
swer such inquiries by saying that they can get all necessary infor-
mation from the commercial columns of The Call, which we consider more
of a guide to both buyer and grower than the average market reports
compiled and sent out by the various houses in the business. Very
truly yours, PORTER BROTHERS COMPANY.
Per
To Mr. W. S. LEAKE,
Mgr. San Francisco Call,
City.
An unusually large number of foreign
immigrants appear to be settling at pres-
ent In some parts of the New England
States, where they obtain work In the
cotton mills and In connection with other
industries. Lately, it is said, in Con-
necticut and Rhode Island the preference

And bid they did. In five minutes with
the persuasion of the auctioneer the
realty was knocked down to Claus Hade
ler of San Franclscp for $1S,400.
Jacob Bro^nstone. agent for Hadeler,
asked the court to fix his commission and
was roundly scored for his presumption.
"This property will not be sold until
the market price Is offered, gentlemen, so
make up your minds to bid." said the
court.

Befor* the Judicial auctioneer had time

OAKLAND. Sept. 2S.-Judge W. E.
Greene had occasion this morning to use
his Judicial gavel as an auctioneer's ham
mer, and that instrument was used with
good effect In the sale of real estate be
longing to the estate of the late Alexan
der Campbell. No red flag flew from the
courtroom door, nor was there the usual
small Doy with his able-bodied bell to at
tract the casual buyer, but when his

JUDGE GREENE ACTS
AS AN AUCTIONEER
Court Conviction Will Probably
Be Sustained by Supremo
Court Ruling.
Oakland Office San FrancljeÂ© Call.
1113 Broadway. Sept. 28.
It Is probable that before long the rattlo.
of the nickel in the hungry slot machine
will again be heard In the local cisar
stores. Judge Greene intimated strongly
this mornlns: that he would overrule tha
decision of Police Judge Mortimer Smllh.
who declared that the machines were Il
legal gambling devices. The case before
the court was the appeal of B. Bercovich.
a cigar dealer, who offered himself as a
sacrifice and waa found guilty and fined
In the Police Court.
Judge Greene stated that had the case
come to him a new one. without a govern
ing decision from the Supreme Court, he
would unhesitatingly decide in accordance
with the Judgment of the lower court. It
seemed to him. though, that the decision
of thft State Supreme Court In ex partÂ©
Shobert laid down a rule which he felt
bound to follow. If the facts in the case
brought it within the ruling In the Sho
bert matter the court intimated thit
thf-re would be no choice for him but to
overrule Judge Smith in favor of the ap
pellant and his machines.
Bercovich was found guilty in the Polica
Court on an agreed statement of facts,
and Immediately appealed under the same
conditions. He was charged with con
ducting a banking game In violation of
the general State law.
The decision in the Shobert case was
that there was no violation of the law
when the amount of interest in excess
only of a certain sum to be obtained waa
to be determined by chance. Bercovich
claims to have guaranteed at least eight
cigars for every dollar played into ni3
machines.
Judge Greene Intimates a
Decision in Their
Favor.

In their reports the gentlemen covered
the problem of irrigation in all its phases;
they took up the question on the eide of

Sacramento Judge Will Sear the
Water Bate Suit on October '
Fourth.
Chairman Mott declared that a test of
the law now in operation as to assess
ments might give the relief demanded and
enable the city to make an assessment
independent of the county's figures, which
are based upon the needs of the State and
county-
When the tax levy ordinance was sub
mitted this year Chairman Frank Mott
of the Finance Committee called atten
tion in much detail to the falling off of
assessment valuations and the consequent
reduction of revenue for municipal pur
poses. It -was shown that there was not
money enough for the ordinary operating
expenses of the city government, which
are now on a most economical basis, even
to niggardly methods. Streets are going
to ruin by miles and the annexed terri
tory is receiving only a modicum of at
tention.
The move has been prompted because ot
the steady decrease In the valuation of
city property which has been made by the
County Assessor. Under the city charter
these figures have been accepted by City
Assessors .without change, the charter
saying:
"The assessment of property- within the
city made by the County Assessor of Ala
meda County and the State Board of
Equalization shall be the basis of taxa
tion for the city."
Under this reading City Assessors have
not touched the figures given them by the
County Assessor except where there may
have been an omission of property from
the tax roll.
To this end Assessor Breed has arbi
trarily raised the assessments $100 each
upon both the real estate and the personal
property holdings of A. B. Kye, F. P..
Girard and H. D. Rowe. It is understood
that neither of these taxpayers proposes
to institute the suit of himself, because
of the expense that would result. The
question of meeting the cost of the litiga
tion Is now in the hands of the Finance
Committee of the City Council.
In accordance with the suggestions con
tained In the recent report of the City
Council Committee on Finance Assessor
Breed has taken the first step toward a
suit to test the city's right to raise the
valuations of property for assessment
purposes as made by the County As
sessor.

Wilson, who is a member of the big coal
firm of J. C. Wilson. & Co.. took an after
noon off yesterday and sought to spend
It In the park. He got out his best rid
ing costume and his favorite horse, and
about the time the driveways were most
crowded, he started westward. He met
many vehicles, among them one on busi

viewed with suspicion by all but the auto

however, that Wilson cantered up to the
thing, or McLaren would not be planning
road repairs;. it wns a senfitive horse that
hauled alongside just as the electricians
shot two links of the ladder skyward and
The electricians applauded freely and
volunteered to be present any time Mr.
Wilson wishes to repeat his performance.
Those who saw It say that Mr. Wilson's
flight was as pretty an exhibition of un
horsemanship as has been seen in the
park. There is some difference of opinion
as to the number of his turns, but there is
none as to how he hit the ground. Had
he had time and a bicycle pump, he might
have inflated the slack of his trousers
and landed more gracefully and with a
proper rebound, but the horse waited for
no preliminaries, and so Mr. Wilson had
to go on with his act at once. As it was.

buds in the surrounding llower gardens,
and with his spurs he cleverly cut '16 to 17
in the macadam as he came down; but
from his choice of a landing place, a
chuck hole was left In the roadway.
Wilson's act was greeted with applause
by the select crowd that watched him,
for in many ways It was a success. A
small boy retrieved his hat and a young
lady kindly returned what was left of his
riding crop. One of the park hands held
up his feet to let the gravel run out of
his boots and In other ways kindly assist

ST. PAUL, Minn., Sept. 26.â President
Hill of the Great Northern, has received
from Chief Engineer Stevens a telegTam
statins that the east and west crews m
the immense bore under the Cascade
Mountains have met. The two forces
working from opposite ends In the bia
tunnel brought the -two ends together
without the variation of an inch.
Now that the tremendous task of borinjj
out over two miles of granite has been
accomplished the work of laying the
tracks is comparatively Insignificant.
The tunnel will now be rushed to speedy
completion. It Is estimated that tne tun
nel, when finished, will have cosf*5,000/X/>.
One thousand men have been engaged
nearly three years in its construction and
all records of tunnelling have been bro
ken. The average progress was IS to a)
feet per dav. :
The tunnel will supersede the "switch
back" over' the Cascades, which in itself,
has always been looked upon as a mag
nificent engineering achievement.
Boring of a Tunnel Under
the Cascades Has Been
Completed. \

The police are preparing for a carnival
of crime among the Chinese tongs this
winter. News has reached Chinatown
from Alaska of a serious highbinder con
flict now in progress in northern waters,
which Is soon to be transferred to this
city. The Sue Dons and ihe Ong Ylcks
became involved in a struggle over a
gambling game and since the opening of
the hostilities several lives have been sac
rificed. In one instance the opposing fac
tions fought with redhot Irons, while
hatchets and pistols were frequently re
sorted to.
When the last vessels from the north to
arrive In this city le,ft Alaska the excite
ment had not abated and the transporta

the hostile tongs down on separate ves
sels. Most of the Chinese will reach this
city next month and will continue their
struggle here.

URGES IMPROVEMENT OF
ARMY-STREET SWAMP
Board of Public Works Recommends
an Appropriation to Construct
Connecting Sewer.
The Board of Public Works recommend
ed on Monday last that the Board of Su
pervisors authorize the . acquisition by
purchase of a strip of real estate between
Serpentine avenue and Army street. 30 by
600 feet, and another piece 30 by 300, the
property of Samuel Bloom, who offers to
sell the land for $3150. The purchase of
the loi 80 by 300 feet, owned by Robert
HIndd, who holds It at $1250, Is also rec
ommended.
The board figures that a sewer can be
constructed thereon for $5000 which, with
the one to be completed on Bryant street,
will stop the How of refuse into the
swamp lying eastward from Potrero ave
nue,, between Army and Twenty-sixth
streets, which has been condemned as un
sanitary by the Board of Health.
An appropriation of $9-400 for the pur
chase of the property and the construc
tion of a sewer from the crossing of
Twenty-fifth street and Potrero avenue to
the sewer in Army street is asked for by
the Board of Works.
Fr>r some weeks past a persistent rumor
has been floating about the Custom-house
to the rffict that charges had been tiled
et Washington against the management
nf the Chir.ene Bureau at this port by
Chief Dunn. Ever since Chief Dunn as
sumed the- management of the bureau the
Chinese coolie importers have tx-en dis-
KiiUsfied with the strict manner in which
he has be^n enforcing the provisions of
the exclusion act. A few weeks ago a
charge was filed with the Collector b v At
torney Stephen Costello alleging that
Chief Dunn had allowed a Chinese Immi
grant to die in the County Jail for lack
of proper medical attendance. Subse
quently Attorney Lyman I. Mowry com
plained to the Co.iector that Chief Dunn
had deponed a Chinese. client of his while
ac appeal was pending. Investigation by
tTie late Col!eetor of the Port Jackson
Â¦hawed that these complaints were not
bas-t-d on m^rit. and they were dismissed.
In view of the rumor that charges had
been f.led with Immigration Commission
er Powderly against Chief .Dunn. The Call
correspondent at Washington interviewed
Mr. Powderly yesterday. Following is the
oorresporsdent's report:
"Coir.migpioner Powderly when aFked

IS VINDICATED

?
Describes Charges Filed at Wash
ington as Being Only of the
Perennial Unfounded
Kind.
The expose In the papers of the way In
which Constable Ahearn of Port Costa ar
rested J. C. Wells, a respectable laborer,
on his way to Vallejo. and detained Wells'
watch and $7 of his money, which Captain
Seymour compelled Ahearn to return, led
to the receipt of an extraordinary letter
by the captain yesterday. The letter was
sent from Reno. Nev., and was signed
"R. Livingstone."
Livingstone wrote that he had seen the
account of Ahearn's doings in the papers
and that he had been a victim of
the Constable. About two months ago
he was walking along the railroad to Val
lejo and was taking a rest on the ties at
Port Costa, when Ahearn came up to him
and gruifly asked him what he was doing
there. Livingstone replied that he was a
i expectable Laboring man looking for a
job. Ahearn made him stand up and
rearched him, taking $5 from a roll of $2S
he had In his pocket. Livingstone asked
the return of the $5 and Ahearn retorted,
''Get out of here," and threatened to ar
rest him for trespassing on the railroad
reserve. Livingstone again demanded his
$5 and Ahearn struck him on the jaw
and said he would give him six months If
he did not move away. He moved.
Livingstone says that many Marshals
and Constables In the Interior compel men
afoot to give them money. He gave a
brakeman $1 for a ride from Bakersfleld
to Fresno recently, and when the train
reached Provo the Marshal made him give
up $2 60, although the brakeman told him
he was getting a free ride. About three
years ago he had been working in Los
Angeles, but lost his Job. He started to
walk to this city and on the way had to
give up $12 75 to Marshals. The Marshal
at Bakersfleld offered to give him J2 to
be arrested. He took the money and was
sentenced to sixty days.' The Jailer let him
out the same evening, telling him they
had no money for his grub. He was ar
rested again at Provo and taken back to
Bakersfleld, where he was sentenced to
thirty days. The Marshal gets his mile
age, the Judge his fee and Livingstone got
thirty-six hours, as the Jailer would not
keep him longer.
"Every Marshal," wrote Livingstone,
"is good for from $1 to $5 and whisky, is
thrown in as a further inducement to be
arrested, so that they can get their mile
age and the Judges their fees. It is the
only State In the Union where laboring
men who are forced to walk from place
to place are made the tools* of Marshals
and Constables. I could give you the
names of a hundred laboring men who
will corroborate my charges."

TO MARSHALS
to-day regarding possible changes in the
management and personnel of the Chi
nese Bureau at San Francisco declared
that no radical changes were contem
plated. He denied that any charges had
been filefl against Chief Dunn of the bu
reau, or against any of the watchmen at
the Chinese detention sheds, and said that
nobody in San Francisco or elsewhere had
made any oral or written complaint to the
Immigration Bureau against the manage
ment of affairs under c'hlef Dunn.
"Mr. Powderly said further: 'There is
absolutely no truth In any of those re
ports. The decrease in the number of ar
rivals of Chinese makes It unnecessary to
keep so large a force as formerly at the
Chinese Bureau in San Francisco. But
there will be no change in the manage
ment. Xo charges of any kind have been
made against the bureau or its employes,
except the perennial charges, which al
ways turn out to be unfounded.' "
$10 and discharged the other five. Madden
promptly gave notice of appeal, saying
that he would test the constitutionality of
the ordinance.
The Superior Court had sustained the
original laundry ordinance which made
the prohibitory hours from 10 p. m. to 6
a. m. on the ground that it was a proper
police regulation within the province of
the Board of Supervisors to enact, but
Madden contends that to make it a mis
demeanor to work later, than 7 p. m. was
unreasonable and unconstitutional.

"Mr. Chairman," broke in the Irrepres

you do not enforce your ruling."
Thereupon Denman. who had all along
been Itching for a chance to jump into the
fray, exclaimed:
"What are you after, Kingsbury? When
you are ordered out why don't you go,
instead of remaining to provide a sensa
tion for the newspapers?"
Kingpbury, pale with suppressed anper,
did not flinch from his position, but quiet
ly asked:
"Will you hear me out of order?"
"No, sir." thundered Casserly, -who
sometimes constitutes himself chairman
even In the presence of President Mark.
"We shall not hear you at all and you
should leave here and save any further
disturbance."
Then Denman arose and demanded that
the sergeant-at-arms immediately re-
the patrol wagon he can assign all felony
cases to the other courts also."
WRANGLE IN SCHOOL BOARD.
Directors Try to Have Deputy Super-
intendent Kingsbury Ejected.
The proceedings of the Board of Educa
tion wrre marked by a disgraceful scene
yesterday morning when an attempt was
made to eject from the meeting Deputy
Superintendent of Public Schools W. D.
Kinpsbury. Kinp-sbury had been delegat
ed by Superintendent Webster to repre
sent him at the meeting during the lat
ter's unavoidable absence and the dram
atic incident was precipitated because of
the board's refusal to recognize Kings
bury as Webster's representative. The

IMPOSTOR RUNS ECTS
RACE AND IS CAUGHT
C. B. Porter, Masquerading as the
Owner of The Call, Commits
Various Frauds.
Chief of Police Sullivan has received in
formation that an impostor calling him
self C. B. Porter has been arrested in
Kansas City and Is held there awaiting
investigation. Porter has run a success
ful race of fraud for nearly a year. He
has traveled nearly all over the United
States representing himself to be the pro
prietor of The Call, and by this imposi
tion has succeeded in defrauding business
men, rallroaus, hotel-keepers and tradess
men out of various sums of money.
Time after time The Call has exposed
him and sent warnings. In answer to in
quiries, to beware of him as he was not
and never had been connected with this
paper in any capacity. These warnings
appear to have had little effect in stop
ping him in his career of fraud. Hu*
latest offense, however, is likely to prove
serious to his future prospects. A few
days ago L,arkin Sons of Kansas City
wrote this ottice for information regard
ing Porter, saying that he had attempted
to cash a draft on a representation tnat
he was the proprietor of The Call.
The Kansas ttrm was informed by tel
egraph that Porter is a fraud, who has
attempted to obtain money all over the
country claiming to be the proprietor of
The CfUl. Larkin Sons were urged to turn
the impostor over to the police at once
and not to let him get away. This evi
dently has been done and Chief of Police
Sullivan has been notified by John Hayes,
Chief of Police of Kansas City.
The Call has been tracking Porter for
nearly a year. In April last he was in
Minneapolis representing himself to be
the editor in chief of The Call. He offered
positions on this paper and succeeded in
defrauding several tradesmen and hotei
keepers. Carrying out the same fraud he
secured railroad transportation and was
discovered operating in Langhorne, Pa.
He also plied his criminal trade in Holy
oke. He Is represented to be a man about
forty-flve years of age and crippled.
tlonery and printing for use of the Boards
of Health, Fire Commissioners, Public
Works and Department of Electricity

move Kingsbury, whom he termed in
"Is there not some way of putting him
out? He has no seat at this board." Then
testy tones, "a stubborn fellow." Casser
ly then turned to Denman and exclaimed:
addressing Chairman Mark, he said:
"I insist that the sergeant-at-arms be
ordered to escort this man from our
presence."
But Sergeant-at-Arms Armer, who Is
65 years of ape and of small stature, had
anticipated the order and realizing that
he was no physical match for Kingsbury,
who is of athletic build, had discreetly re
tired from the scene some time previous
to Casserly's call for his services.
"I demand that my protest against the
board's proceedings this morning be
entered upon the minutes." said Kings
bury, who throughout the dispute had
calmly ignored Casserly's outbursts.
"How can your protest be recorded?"
interjected Casserly. "You have no more
right here than the merest stranger. You
have no standing here; please remove
vourself."
"We are not here to consider protests,"
said Denman.
"Your past record Indicates that you do
not care for the protests of citizens,"
quickly retorted Klrpsbury.
"We are able to stand more, criticism
than that," answered Denman.
Mark was inclined to the belief that the
State law permitted Kingsbury to repre
sent his superior, but contended that the
charter was silent on the question. The
merry row, however, continued until it
came to an Inglorious end by Denman
moving to adiourn, which was carried.
Though Casserly seconded the motion he
voted against Its adoption, and bent on
having the last word, ejaculated:
"In recording this adjournment, Mr.
Chairman. I lns'st that It be entered that
we were prevented from performing our
duties through the Interference of Deputy
Superintendent Kingsbury."
WHEN" Judge Cabanlss adjourned
court yesterday he intimated
that en ar.d after to-day he
would hold court in the new
Hall of Justice. He wrote a
formal letter to that effect to Chief Sul
livan po that the prisoners assigned to
his court could he taken from the City
Prison to the Hall of Justice in a patrol
wagon.
Chief Sullivan will Ignore the letter, and
Â¦when the Judge takes his seat on the
bench in his new courtroom this morning
there will only be himself ar.d clerk pres
ent, as his bailiffs. Policemen Fleming
and Carmichael, have been Instructed by
the Chief to be on duty in the old court
room where tho prisoners â¢will be taken.
It will be interesting to note the develop
ments, as both the Chief and Judge are
determined to follow out their declared
intentions.
"All the courts will open next Monday
morning in the Hall of Justice." said the
Chief, "and I f=ce no reason why Judge
Cabaniss should not remain In his pr^senv
courtroom till then. It iÂ« commodious ar.d
comfortable and he would not be incon
venienced in any way by remaining where
tie is> for three days more. The prisoners
would have to be taken from the prifon
to the Hall of Justice in a patrol wagon
and I am not poing to run the risk of
pome of thrm escaping-. There was an ex
ample of that not long ago when a pris
oner escaped frcm a wagon while coming
with other prisoners from the California*
Ftrrct station to the prison. Besides there
is the ir.convenier.ee. which is unnecessary.
The prisoners assigned to Judge Cabanlss
will be taken to his old courtroom as
usual and if the Judge is not there to dis
pose of the cases it will be his own fault.
The bailiffs are under my direction and
will not go to the Hall of Justice till
Monday."
The Judge said he did not care what
course the Chief took: he was determined
to hold court in the Hall of Justice. "I
was Informed," he said, "that Judge Slo
gan would return to duty to-day and on
that account I continued several cases till
to-morrow and Friday to be heard in my
new courtroom and that is one reason for
my action. I will not hold court In that
Etuffy. disease-breeding courtroom which
I occupied before Judge Mogan left on
his vacation. The drunks can be assigned
to the other two courts and If the Chief
is alraid of any prisoners escaping from
for presentation to the board providing
for the chronological order or appoint
ment of teachers. He had read but a
few words when Casserly asked Chairman
Mark to stop Kingsbury from proceeding
on the ground that the charter did not
grant deputy superintendents the privi
lege to represent the Superintendent at
the meetings of the board. Mark there
upon ruled Kingsbury out of order.
"I protest that the board has no author
ity either In the charter or in the State
law to prevent me from appearing here
as the representative of Mr. Webster,"
said Kingsbury. "I warn you that I shall
challenge the legality of your proceed
ings should you persist in denying me
the right to speak."
Kingsbury then quoted from the Politi
cal Code. State Superintendent Kirk and

a sale that for many weeks past has
been absorbing the interest of money-
saving folks, there are still many
short ends of desirable merchandise,
in almost every department, that we

count cost when we want them out
of the way so badly, come early â
and visit every department, you'll
be amply repaid.
our old store closes to-night forever.

The Sfeinway
Pi2r.o is a work of art. The su-
preme excellence of the Stein-
way is due to the lifetime study
of three generations, each work-
ing: constantly to bring this piano
to its present stage of absolute
perfection. To-day the Steinway
lives in a sphere of its own. Why
not trade your piano for a Baby
Grand Steinway? Come in and
let us talk it over with you.
