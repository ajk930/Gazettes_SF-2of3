â¢* This is the positive assertion of
Louis Gathmar.n, Inventor of the Gath
tnann system of ordnance, anfl Is mado
â¢tritli the proviso, of course, that the.
Ga.tiimann gun and torpedo are used in
the equipment cf this new navy.
Mr. Gathmann is a native of Germany.
He Is. however, a naturalized American
of thirty-five years" residence and a
BTeater portion of this time has been
spent in practical experiments with high
explosives. The predominating char
acteristic* of Mr. Uathmann's physiog
nomy are practicability and determina
tion. HÂ© believes he has attained the ob
ject for which he lias been working and
modestly attributes his success to these
two qualities. The story of his invention
trom its inception, lils years of patient
labor and then the long eiege of diplo
macy in order to get the Government auf
fldently interested to meet the expense
of practical demonstrations Is most in
teresting, ae toid in his modest way.
"I regard the new gun as absolutely
perfect in every way," said he. "It was
built by the Bethlehem Steel Company
entirely under my direction. It is of
"nickel steel, of proportions that have been
<iemonstrated to be the ban for ordnance
construction. It weighs fifty-nine tons,
Is forty-four fo<t long and has an
eifrhtren-bore.
"Its distinguishing features are Its large
Dorc ar.d comparatively uniform thickness
throughout its length. Thi> is to eon
form to the peculiarity of smokeless
powder, which exerts a more uniform
pressure. Tlie remit in that you g*t a
very high, muzzle velocity with a com
paratively low pressure per square Inch
of gun surface. For In5tance. Ill a gun
capable of withstanding IH.OM pounds
pressure to the square inch you get a
velocity of lf<XÂ» feet per second*.
"The Government required that the test
of the gun which has just been completed
should demonstrate a pressure of 18,000
pound? and give a velocity of 1800 feet per
eeeond. There- la no doubt that it Is capa
ble of both these requirements and can
â¢ven suptain a greater pressure and attain
a higher velocity.
"Of course, the tests thus far have not
developed the destroying power of the
g-un Tihtn my torpeuo Â¦ is used. These
tests will bo made when the gun Is taken
to the Sandy Hook proving grounds, I
hope in the near future. The cost of the
pun has been JCa.O'Xt. and Congress appro
priated SlO.dcO more for ammunition.
â¢'"When the te-ts are made with the gun
cotton torppdoep," ?ald Mr. Gathmann, "I
want a chance to aim it either at an old
monitor or a structure built on land, with
at leaM double the resisting qualities of- a
modern l>attle t=hip. If a monitor is pro
vided it mu!=t be reinforced with, an extra
coating t,f the heaviest and best armor
plate that can be secured. In these team
1 also want a second monitor or structure
provided on which the best mins of our
modem ordnance shall be trained, for thÂ«
purpose of poelng the superiority of the
Gethmann Fystem.
"I contend that one shot from my gun
trtli utterly annihilate the target, no
matter what it is. and to" bear me -out in
this we have the proof of the experiments
which I have already made in the way of
destroying armor-plated structures at the
Government proving grounds -at Sandy
Hook. "The photographs taken of these
structures before and after the shot were
liken by the Government and are a part
of the official records of the ordnance bu
reau of the War Department.
"The main feature of the G&thmann eys
tem lies in the construction of the tor
pedo. Outside of my Invention there Is no
known way to handle guncotton with any
safety whatsoever. It cannot be fired from
the ordinary gun in the ordinary shell
Â¦without bursting the Run an.i exploding
the shell at the same time. The novelty
. In my system is the fact that the fuse la
not brought in vital contact with the wet
ctuncotton in the torpedo until after the
projectile has left the ifun.
"As soon as the pressure of the gun on
the projectile Is lessened, or. In other
words, as soon as the projectile- ha? left
:he gtm a distance of say 600 fp"t, the fuse
'? thereby brought in contact -with the wet
Â£uncottnn and the least impact export**
thÂ«> tornado. "
"The torpedo for thfs run la to welsh
IS0O pounds". It ts constructed so that
most of tho metal tÂ» in the rear end. the
point being quite thin to make the im
wct more easily felt. This la true to such
Â»n extent that even If the torpedo In its
lisbt comes in contact with the water it
will explode. However. If the torpedo
itrlkcs the water within thirty feet of a
ihip and explodes at thnt point it will
ear a hole !n the ship sufficient to dla
ible it.
"The destructive power of these torpe
lors does not diminish by length o* range,
the maximum carry we will say is six
niles, and, unlikr the armor piercing pro
ectilo. its destructive force is Just as
treat after its force In velocity Is spent
is before, as It is the explosion that does
he work. Tho torpedo la loaded with a
ittle over 600 rounds of giincotton. and
hose familiar with the terrible power of
his explosive can Imagine what havoc its
explosion would make."
Mr. Gathmann was asked why in mak
ng tests at Indian Head in 1S97 one of. h'^
orpedoes had exploded in the breach of 5>
tun, causing its complete demolition.
"That happened because my fuse- was
jot used In that torpedo." he replied. "A
Jifferent fuse was used at the suggestion
af the ordnance officers. I gave my con
tent to this change, thinking- the experi
ment was worth trying. The result was
as I had feared it might be. All the crit
icism that has been made of my system
has probably come from thl3 accident,
when, as a matter of fact, it was not my
system that Â¦was being tested at all.
"Several of my torpedoes had been fired
successfully from this pun previous to tha
ore which exploded before leaving It.
Many successful tests have been madÂ»
with my torpedoes fired from the ordinary
gun and of various calibers."
"I have expended over $25,000 of my own
money, and have exploded nearly 10.000
pounds of sTincotton in. the course of my
experiments. I became familiar with ev
ery known way of exploding sruncotton,
and at last hit upon a fuse that la abso
lutely safe.
"It is impossible to explode one of my
torpedoes before it has been tired from a
pun. If the fuse is lighted it will do no
harm. This fact has been so thoroughly
demonstrated in thf> various experiments
that have bfcn made under the ohserva-"
tion of the ordnance officials that I am
satisfied that most if not all of these of
ficials are convinced of the success and
superiority of my system of handling gun
cotton, and also of the practicability of
firing it from a high-pressure gun with
powder as the propelling fnrce.
"The natural prejudice," went on Mr.
Gnthmann. "against any new system of
ordnance is great. I was told by Admiral
Sampson that he could remember when,
shell's exploded by pnwdrr fiat came into
use. He said the officers and men were
so afraid of them that the shells were
hung over the sides pi the ship, where
they would do the least damage If ex- .
ploded.
"On the point of the future of the
Gathmann system I cm Â«ajr that * look
for an entirely new era in r.aval and land ;
warfare. There was a revolution in naval
warfare when the o'd wooden ships -with
their hundred suns were demolished by
the monitor. The day of the monitor ts
over and wo have gradually '< got back
asrafn to the ship of a hundred guns, but
of course it is an Ironclad shrp and much
more valuable in every way than the old
frigate The fault with the present bat
tleship is that It !s too big. It furnishes
too good a target.
"If I -were to predict a new cla.Â«s of
battleship I would say that it should not
make such a good target It should be bis
enough to carry a few of my guns and be
car>.-ib!e of withstanding the attack of the
modern' battl-shin at a two-mile range;
nearer than this it would not be necessary
to KO and its speed should be sufficient to
keep 'at this distance. One shot from its
battery would finish any ship afloat if it

GREATEST GUN ON THE FACE OF THE EARTHWith an Aiglon for business and a La
Tosca for. pleasure, you can do very well
without furs; but If you fall In the -way
of 1900's sealskin temptations you mU3t bÂ«
brave Indeed to resist.
The sweeping long effect Is emphasized
by Its Empire cut. Its short waist
amounts to hardly more than a yoke, out
lined by a stitched satin belt. This belt
clasps in the front under two fat rosettes
from which dangle gold ornaments. Tha
gold or silver ornament, by the way. is
the seal of this season's garment.
"La Tosca" Is the name of thÂ© handsom
est cloak that 1300 has produced so far.
It sweeps almost to the floor, leaving Just
room for a flutter of the theater gown to
show below It. Black satin Is the correct
material for La Tosca: rever3 and collar
of Persian lamb are perfect, and the lin
ing may be in any shade of satin you de
sire, preferably ivory.
The black Aiglon is especially stunning.
It Is lined throughout with white cloth,
which has a Grecian key border of black
stitching. But the collar Is the most gor
geous affair. The shape of the Aiglon col
lar Is unique, being a tight turnover; and
the part turned over la wide enough to
give the tailor room for many flights of
fancy. In this case he has laid scarlet
and white broadcloth in sharp contrast,
bringing: them together In a geometrical
border. A black hat is the complement
of this cloak, and a single note of scarlet
In the hat will carry out the scheme to
perfection.

Collarettes are to be worn, and they are
patterned much after those of last year.
Fullness on tha shoulders is avoided; all
the length of the garment Is thrown to
the front and the back, and the fur on the
shoulder scarcely reaches over the'top of
the eleeve. And above- all, the law of
wearing the collarette never changes: It
is this. To wear It over a shirt waist is
Impossibly bad form. Don't ask why.
Look at the effect, and you will surely

Heroines of the Blb'e
"H^rplnes cf the Bible" Is a very at
tractive volume by Clara Ersklne Clem
ent. The book consists of SGO pages de
voted to the lives of the women of the
E)!>!e and is illustrated with thirty-three
haif-tor.e rej-roductions from celebrated
jair.tir.p.-: by the great masters, which
naturally form a most acceptable addi
tion to the textâ some of them have been
reproduced upon this page and will serve
t.Â» give an idea of the excellence of the
Ticrk.
The author writes with a high approcla
t\rn of art, of romance and of the beauti
ful. Her style is simple and direct, and
a* a matter of pure biblical history the
book is of worth as well as possessing
vcluÂ« in the descriptions of the paintings
by the greatest artists the world has ever
known. She gives first the story of the
individual and then a description of the
paintings by the different artists and a
comparison of the varied conceptions of
the same subject.
As there might be a possible misconcep
tion of the title. "Heroines of the Bible."
It may be well to quote from the author
her explanation for the selection of the
word "heroines" as a part of the caption:
"I here use the word 'heroine' as denot
ing the woman who plays the most Im
portant part in a story; but did I wish
to give the word a strictly critical sense.
I should not know where to turn for more
romance, poetry, heroismâ In Its fullest
significationâ than I find In the lives of
the women of the Bible."
An Index completes the volume, which

herself and her drunken brute of a hus

the sympathy of the reader. Had It not
been for the skill of the doctor in operat

by his wife. Â¦
The doctor loves Alves and wishes to
marry her. but Alves will not consent to
a ceremony, fearing his love would not
last and he would be tied to her, as she
had been to a man she did not love. After
living together for some time she reasons
that she has kept the doctor from suc

The Web of Life.
Robert Herrick has adopted the realistic
style in his last novel, "The Web of Life."
The scene is laid In Chicago about the
time of the great Pullman railroad strike.
The hero, a young physician, has decid
edly socialistic tendencies, and through
the whole book there Is a vein of dis
gust for the "new rich" of Chicago. Mr.
Herrick does not idealize his characters,
but plainly and tersely portrays three
types of the "comfortable rich" â the
speculator, the railroad magnate and the
fashionable specialist.
The book Is strong and Intensely Inter
esting, but it is to be regretted that the
author dees not use his strength and' force
on some plot that would leave a better
impression on one's mind.
The pathos of Alves Preston's lifeâ

fear that he will hate her because of her
crime, causes Alves to kill herself. Dr.
Summers, who is but an average mortal,
mourns for some time for the woman who
gave her life for him, and after two year3
marries Louise Hitchcock. She is a girl
whose social position , the doctor once
scorned. She Is well fcrcd. of not much
depth and one who' "handles her world
with perfect self-control." After his ro
mantic past Dr. Summers settles down to'
humdrum conventionality with much ease.

BOOK REVIEWS AND LITERARY CHAT.Civilization, says the Ledger Monthly,
makes women more beautiful than all the
barbaric arts and resources of primitive
life, and it is because of a misconception
of conditions that any ascribe to . the
habits of semi-civilized people a cause of
any special beauty among their womeu.
Primitive life is harder and more difficult
for womankind than that found In highly
civilized lands. The outdoor life of the
former does not entirely counterbalance
the evils of unsanitary surroundings, hard
drudgery and lack of Intellectual associa
tions. It is only modern civilized nations
that have given to woman her true place
In the scheme of humanity. Her emanci
pation from servitude and unpleasant con
ditions have yielded more direct benefit"
than any other transformation of her ex
istence.

Eure enough, the water was' creeping In

was gradually filling. It was Icy cold and
crept higher and higher. In vain the men
wadedaround seeking the inlet. The
crafty moonshiners had evidently planned
It well, and In their absence the. girl and
colored woman had carried out the plan.

THE WAY MCKINLEY MADE HIS START
There are romances of war which al
most reconcile one to its grim tragedies,
because war alone can weave the threads
and develop the qualities of heroes, says
Success for August.
The civil war had scarcely broken out
when a sturdy lad of 17 walked into thÂ»
recruiting office of John C. Fremont, the
great pathfinder, in an Ohio town.
He simply asked to be enlisted and sent
to the front. His eagerness was noticed
by the veteran plainsman, who spoke
kindly to him and ordered that his nams
be enrolled.
There began a life romance which cul
minated in the White House. The boy
was William McKinley. He was assigned
to the Twenty-third Ohio Regiment, of
which Rutherford B. liayes was colonel.
At Antietam came an incident which. In
my opinion, is one of the most thrilling of
that awful war. Lee had pushed his vic
torious legions Into Maryland. Stonewall
Jackson was by his side. Longstreet was
in the front of the fightâ all on the South
ern side. On the Northern side were Mc-
Clellan and Sheridan, grimly contesting
every foot of the advance. On the flrst
day of the battle. September 17. 1S62. thÂ«
troops on both sides fought with such des
peration that r.o less than 23,000 men were
wounded or killed. On the second day,
from early morning. Lee's terrific fire was
directed upon the Federal line which had
been turned against his right. On tha
banks of the creek, to the left of tha
bridge, was the Twenty-third Ohio.
Colonel Hayes had been wounded shortly
before at South Mountain, so he was not
in command of his regiment that day. Ha
was in the village a few miles to tha rear
watching the smoke of battle In agonized
unrest. General Scammon was in com
mand In his stead. Away to the rear was
the commissary sergeant of the regiment,
waiting for orders. As the hot and dusty
day wore on and evening fell this ser
geant grew impatient to be at the front,
not to fight, but to carry food and firtnk
to his exhausted comrades, who had had
neither breakfast nor dinner. Finally he
hooked up two wagons, called for volun
teer drivers nnd started for the front
without orders. As he approached thÂ«
front one team of mules was shot down.
With the other he pushed on. braving tha
leaden hail and the bursting shells, and
succeeding In reaching the boys of bis
command.
How they cheeretl him as he drove up!
A few minutes later General Scammon
rode up to ascertain the cause of tha
cheering. Instead of reprimanding thÂ«
boy he thanked him for his thoughtful
ness and bravery and permitted him to
distribute- the refreshments under fire.
With his own hand Sergeant McKinleyâ
for It was heâ passed around cups of
steaming hot coffee and liberal rations of
bread and meat. The fight was main
tained right along. The battle proved to
the North that Lee could be defeated.
Colonel Hay en was so pleased when ha
heard of this exploit that he asked Gov
ernor Todd of Ohio to commission the boy
a lieutenant. This was done September 24,
1SCT.
Thus In one brave boy's life ther* has
been a triple romanceâ his enlistment by
a Presidential candidate, his recommenda
tion by another man who became.Presi
dent for a commission, and finally his own
accession to the chief magistracy of thÂ»
nation. ,
Another very dangerous" practice Is the
not common one of using several razors
for a single shave. Two razors are al
lowable, but to use more than two even

It Is well to remember that if one con

early In life, making a man prematurely

should, therefore, be reformed before it
is too late.

a man wait f=ome time for another chair
rather than expose himf-elf to this dan

see the girl. She was fitting at a table
reading.
The deputies quietly agreed to first
search the house before venturing out for
the moonshiners. Undoubtedly some of
the contraband goods was barreled In the
cellar. It was not unlikely that the still
was there.
"Have you any cider In the housj?"
asked a deputy. The girl flushed and
looked very much embarrassed. "I reckon
there's some in that bottle," she answered
In a faltering voice. The man drained It
at a quaff. "Come, come, my girl," he
paid, "there must be more where this
comes from. Give us a bumper. We've

It was In Northern New York that Mr.

a limping gait. The deputies had traveled
for two days through a blinding snow

the moonshiners warned and ready. They
exchanged compliments -with their pls-

the S. G. individually dictated tho entries
In the Gazette concerning an Insignificant
assistant like Blake. Blake had been dis
missed In January, but the Gazette was
not due till March, so that his resignation
waa not known outside of Peking.
Harked as "Unattached" he might re
main lost to view for a year without for
feiting his right to reappear In his or
dinary vocation. Many so-called "unat
tached" assistants are engaged on special
missions which it Is not advisable to ad
vertise.
What was tha reason of these two
prompt volte-faces on tha part of tha
methodical B. G.?
CHAPTER XIV.
KCEI^LIEN'.
In the previous chapter we recorded M.
5e Samovar's bombshell demand for a
new Commissioner at Nluchwang. As
=oon as he had departed Mr: Poricord,
deep in perplexity and with his head
sunk on his breast, returned slowly to his
=anctum. His movements about the
house were always quiet, and all the
loors opened noisele.-sly. On entering hi*
study he surprised tho boy Kuei-Hen
within.
His mind bclnp: Imbued with fears of
Russia, he associated the lad's Intrusion
with the thought of Russian Intrigues;
perhaps he was a spy, like Valda.
"Since >ou appear to be taking the placa
of my boy. Kuel-lion, you may brln? me
my tea." was all he pal.l.
He sank into a chair ar.<l drew from a
pigeonhole marked K (R) Â« bundle of pa
pers. In turnir.s? them over he lighted on
nne which had certainly not been placed
there by himself, for the paper was of a
different style to that furnished by Par
kin & Gotto to the Revenue Department.
Mr. Poricord scrutinized the paper
closely. He had little doubt that it had
Just been placed there by the new ser
vant, and he supposed that it wa* a
ppurlous dispatch to conceal the theft of
some important document. But he ha<I
no sooner glanced over it than his face
betrayed something like excitement. It
was a translation of part of a dispatch
from M. de Samovor to Count Muravleff.
Although not entire, it bore the date and
preamble, which made It clear that it pre
tended to be a reproduction of the letter
stolen from the courier by Blake. This
only Increased Mr. Perlcord's suspicions.
It seemed to explain the mystery of the
mail robbery. M. de Samovar was trying
to Min.l him (Mr. Pericord) by putting
into his hands a false statement of Rus
sia's Intentions which should have every
appearance of being authentic. Having
failed in the first Instance through Mr.
Pericord's refusal to read the stolen let
ter, he had now bribed this servant to
place in his desk an apparent translation
of that letter. He recalled how the new
piccolo player had been thrust on his at
tention by M. de Samovar, and he had, no
doubt that Wang was a spy.
When he read the document all these
pupplclons were scattered. There could
be no doubt of Us authenticity and gen
ulnene*s.- The stolen dispatch had indeed
been a bona fide communication, In cipher,
and this was unmistakably a bona fide
translation of that cipher. The whole
process of decipherment was shown, as
may he seen by the anglicised rendering
of ono sentence, which was, however,
spread over four lines of meanlnglesi:
[query.
Mohat blgotlzmef lateris add note-Mht
Bgtzmf Itrs ad ntqr Niu Chwang must ba
ours.
The disclosures contained in this confi
dential dispatch were such as the Min
ister could not possibly have desired Mr.
Pcricord to know. They frankly revealed
Russia's intrigues in Manchuria and Rus-
Eia's secret understanding with Germany
regarding the open doer question, 'xhey
contained a reference to France which
alone was sufficient to detach that power
from the Russian alliance. In fact, this
was an Instrument in Mr. Perlcord's
hands which, without any diplomatic
pressure, would enable him to stiffen the
back of the Tsung-11 Yamen to resist Rus
pia's interference. He had merely to
make certain hints in private conversa
tion with M. de Samovar to cause that
gentleman to withdraw his demand for a
Russian Commissioner at Nluchwang.
Tha placing of the paper In his desk at
that Juncture was Indeed the work of a
friend. Blake's loyalty In intention he
had never doubted, but now he was com
pelled to suppose that the person who had
instigated Blake had also been loyal.
That person was Valda- Valda had pro
tested a gratuitous devotion to him in a
manner which It had been cruelly hard
to doubt. But what had the piccolo play
er to do with Valda a.nd Blake?
Kuei-llen brought in the tea. Mr. Peri
cord, while apparently absorbed In his
documents, studied the youth attentively.
His own face, had he known It, afforded
a curious study. One might have thought
that he was indulging in a reprehensible
espionage.
"You have thick hair," be said, lifting
the bov's heavy queue as it fell on the
arm of his chair when Kuel-llen stooped
over the tea tray.
The boy's hand trembled so that he
spilled the tea; his face crimsoned over.
Although the remark was natural enough,
Mr. Pericord's voice had quivered as if
it had required a strong effort of will to
utter tho words. So a younger man's
voice might quiver when venturing the
first tentative word of love to a proud
beauty. i
"They say our hair grows long because
we cut it in front." faltered tha boy.
bending low over the tray. There was no
light save that of the open grate In the
room.
Mr. Pericord stole a glance at the white
Â¦calp visible beyond tha rim of tha neat
skull cap. HÂ» noticed thÂ« shell-like deli
cacy of the boy's small ear. Although,
when the eye is used to It, the Chinese
custom has a distinct beauty of Its own,
Mr Perlcord seemed to see something pa
thetic and regretful in that neatly shaven
temple.
"Yao pel-tang, tung-chia?" said tha
boy, holding the sugar tongs. It was the
first time he had been allowed the privi
lege of waiting on the S. G. In person.
â¢â¢Two lumps, please," replied the S. G.
absently, in English. The boy, who pro
fessed Ignorance of English, dropped in
two pieces of sugar.
"Don't go, Kuei-llen." Mr. Pericord
murmured, apparently busy with the pa
pers on his knee. He always took his aft
ernoon tea in his armchair, seated by the
fire. It was his only hour of relaxation,
apart from his morning hour in bed.
Mr. Pcricord made no allusion to the
strange document, but said presently,
with the air of a man who Is trying to
solve a doubt, "Will you bring your whis
tle, Kuei-lien, and play to me?"
The boy was proficient on all simple
flute Instruments, and could produce from
an ordinary brars whistle melodies well
adapted for a small* roum.
Kucl-Hen obeyed, and seating himself
on a low Btool on the opposite shadow of
the fireplace, played some of the old and
simple ballad airs which were Mr. Perl
cord's favorites. The S. G. listened with
his chin resting on his palm. At length
he moved- and, stooping over the arm of
the chair, reached for a big violoncello,
swathed in an old green bag. He tuned it
a little and scraped the chords.
"See if you can accompany me, Kuei
lien," he said.
After snatches of some of his stereo
typed band pieces, the S. G. passed im
perceptibly to a new Russian love song
which had appeared In Peking: for the
first time that â¢winter. Introduced by Miss
I5erislcoff. The boy continued to accom
â¢pany without wavering.. Indeed, he whis
tled the air with the facility and expres
sion of familiarity. Independent of the
'cello's subtones. The singular duet pro
duced a pretty harmony, and at one pas
sage In the song the deep, low wall of
the strings seemed to speak like the Im
passioned voice of a man.
When Kuel-llen ceased of his own ac
cord the air of the darkened room was
quivering with human emotion. The walla,
or the atmosphere, of a small room, es
pecially in the gloaming of firelight, have
the sympathetic capacity of re-echolngr,
for a little while, the unspoken passions
of the soul which are Interchanged In
music. Mr. Perlcord, who had a sensitive
Imagination, evidently felt this myster
ious Influence, for he sat for some min
utes In Pllence, his bow hanging idly from
li!s hand. He uttered a deep sigh. Then,
In a voice full cf sadnes3 and regret, ha
said:
"Thank you, Kuel-llen; I mustmot de
tain you any longer."
The next day the piccolo player was re
lieved of further personal attendance on
the S. G. He was net dismissed, but, on
the contrary, removed from the servants'
quarters In the rear of the compound to
a small sleeping room In the house. Ills
duties, however, were quietly taken from
him, and he was left to amuse hlmselt
how he might, with certain Implied re
strictions which would prevent him com
ing within sight of his master. The other
servants supposed that the boy was to go
through a course of study preparatory to
promoting him to a subordinate clerkship
en the staff, a step that would have sur
prised no one, for Kuel-llen was obviously 4
"above his place." Had there been any
women In this ascetic household they
might have whispered that the S. O. had
private reasons for shunning the sight of
his beautiful as Saul sometimes
shunned David.
The room allotted to Kuel-llen had at
one time been n boudoir, and the books,
photographs, ornaments and piano had
never been removed. This isolated room
was situated Immediately over the S. G.'s
study, and was connected with It by a
long disused speaking tube. Here thÂ«
lonely lad was Eometlme. heard playing to
himself.
In spite of the opportune Russian docu
ment, Mr. Perlcord evidently did not ab
solve the boy of all Suspicion. He had no
sooner dispatched his curt reply to Mr.
Samovar than he had misgivings concern
ing Its wisdom. Indeed, In many things
his usual clearness of action seemed to
be forsaking him. He was often preoccu
pied, as a business man will sometimes
be by domestic cares. A slight sound,
especially the faint echo of music, would
disturb him.
Meeting Mr. Samovar one day he said
to him:
"You have no news of Miss Berlskofft
M. de Samovar?"
"I believe her to bo In Shanghai," re
plied the Minister.
After some hesitation the S. O. said:
"The piccolo player whom you Intro
duced to me bears a remarkable resem
blance to your ward, M. de Samovar."
Mr. Samovar laughed frankly. "I don't
wonder; he Is Valda's brother!" Then ha
told Mr. Pericord tha facts of Valda's
birth.
"Of course ! you attribute all sorts of
base motives to me now, Mr. Perlcord,"
he concluded with the same air of frank
ness. "But I declare you would do me
an Injustice. Ton know what Chinese and
their relatives are. Valda had, unknown
to me, renewed acquaintance with her
, precious family, and, of course, they pest
ered her for foreign positions. This "Wang,
after all, played the piccolo well. But If
you have the (-.lightest suspicion of his
honesty send him back to me. My at
tache, Vasslllch, has taken a fancy to
him."
Mr. Perlcord did not send: Kuel-llen
back. Nevertheless, he was informed
i that the boy sometimes slipped out
to the Russian Embassy, and he
â¢ appeared by no means set at
, ease by Mr. Samovar's explanation. Â¦;>Â¦.'.;;'
CHAPTER XV.
. THE OPENING OF THE TEAR 1900.
, In the meantime had come and pone the
: great festival of China New Year, which
Â» heralded in the twenty-fifth year of the
i unhappy Emperor Kwang Hsu, the fifth
. cycle of the Manchu dynasty ho repro
l sented, and the last year of the nine
teenth century of Christendom. This
s nineteenth century had been almost as
, pregnant in change and prophecy for
t China as for Europe. It had seen tho
i steadfast encroatftiment of "Western Inno
vations on a civilization which had en
> dured without change for over 2000 year*.'
: It had suffered the shock of three foreign
. wars and witnessed the Introduction of
, militant Christianity, of modern weapons,
9 of foreign loans, of telegraphs, of rall
, ways. It had felt, what made a far deeper
â¢ Impression than the burning of the Sum
i mer Palace or the destruction of the Pel
yang fleet, the suave but inflexible gTlp
Â» of a methodical and conscientious for
5 elgner on the collection of the revenue,
- and watched with Impotent jealousy the
sure extension of hl3 fingers until In the
â¢ ramifications of a great civil service they
- spread over all the corners of the empire
i and threatened to close In on the very
likin and land-tax, which supported a mil-
I lion of proud but greedy extortionists.
- In fact, solid and impenetrable aa was
- the bulk of native conservatism, no ob
Â» servant Chinaman could leave his Inland
. home without realizing that an Irresistible
encroachment had taken place and could
8 never be pushed back save by tho ex
â¢ termination of every foreigner, and every ,
o convert to f orelgnlsm, within the limits
- of the empire. ;
For Europe and America, on the other
e hand, the year 1900 was welcomed with
n rejoicing as the eve of the 'millennium;
II the threshold of that twentieth century
which must surely witness the culmina
f tlon of scientific socialism, bringing with
f It the sublimation of enlightenment and
d the universal dominion of peace. It was
- to be the century of the brotherhood of
h nations; a liberty, fraternity and equality
h which should include even. China in ita
if benevolent embrace.
>, On this day it waa the custom for all
t the high mandarins of the Tsung 11 Ya
men to pay their respects to the legations
!- In a body. The appearance of these cav
alcades, these processions of eight-bearer
â¢- chairs, this sea of sign-poles, this swarm
t- of conical-hatted retainers and , peacock.
S plumed secretaries, In the quiet precincts
And all the time in the surrounulni*
streets and for miles und miles through
out the monstrous city the increasing
and reverberant din of crackers and can
non-seemed to be sending a tocsin of un
holy revel, as If the stolid millions had
awoke to a consciousness of their con
'glomerate strength and were indulginr
in war dances of defiance and Insult.
Even New York on the Fourth of Juiy
On previous -occasions there had wont
to be a show of at least a spurious cor
diality and empressement on, the part
6f the visiting mandarins; the glass of
champagne which they took at each le
gation assisted the hollow cheerfulness.
But this year every one noticed an Im
palpable something in the bearinar of thene
visitors which rendered cordiality impos
sible. They seemed, with one accord to
look on their foreign hosts with a sort
of shivering curiosity, as if behind them
they saw ghostly apparitions. It was ob
served that at the German embassy they
refused to take wine. The whole cere
mony was felt to hav9 been a fiasco and
every one was relieved when It was over.
Â¦adors, like tributary states, as contempt
ible as Korea. And the stolid millions,
whose din around them was like the
hoarse murmur of the sea against an islet,
took note of this official contempt for the
foreigners and looked curiously through
their gates, wondering how soon the sig
nal would come to divide among them
selves the spoils within.
of Legation street, brought home to tti*
observer in a most startling: fashion the
isolation and "taboo" of the foreign Min
isters in Peking. Only then did one real
ize how utterly Ignored were these repre
sentatives of the great powers by tha
court to which they were accredited. They
lived as unnoticed in one small street of
the vast city as any Insignificant colony
of Shansl Mohammedans or Mongolian
camel drivers clustered in reed huts out
side the northern gates; as unrecognized
by the high society of the capital as tho
Chinese colony in New York. The im
perial city, the home of the Government
of the empire, the center of all the In
trigues which they were here to take a
hand in, was to them literally nothing
more than a wall; none had over entered
its gates, walked in its spacious avenues
and wondrous parks, nor even, from tho
parapet of tho Tartar wall seen more of
Its thronging palaces than a glimpse of
yellow tile through the tops of trees.
Twice a year these powerful represent
atives of foreign states were permitted
to bow before the Emperor's efflgyâ and
even the poor boy himself was but a
waxen effigyâ in one of the pavilions out
side the gate; once a year the great man
darins of the Foreign Office condescended
to pay an official visit. Social intercourse
there was none; the legations were sim
ply tolerated and ignored, and the real
capital of China retained Its haughty se
clusion unbroken, treating Europe -and
America, in the persons of their Embaa-
missionary riots all along the valleyof the
YangtsÂ«. Another spell of ten years wit
nessed the Japanese war, the invasion of
missionaries into the remotest provinces,
the seizure of Port Arthur by the Rus
sians, Kiaochau by the Germans and
Weihaiwel by the British, and finally the
projection and active construction of rail
roads everywhere, as if all obstacles had
been overcome and Chtna existed only as
the happy hunting ground of foreign cap
italists, while its ancient prejudices, iU
proud mandarlnate. Its secluded court,
were ignored as Images whose day had
passed forever. r i -*Â¦".Â¦
This railway enterprise and foreign en
croachment was most conspicuous in tha
two northern provinces of Shantung and
Chili. In the mountains of the Shan
tung promontory, peculiarly sacred to the
memory of Confucius and the cult of Bud
dha. German mining engineers were pros
pecting everywhere under the escort of
German marines. Tho hardy and Inde
pendent natives Vrere being handled dlc
tatorially by the Iron fist of German sol
diers. It was a treatment to which they
were not used. Chu. the Governor Gen
eral, In his capital. Chlnan, felt that at
any moment a German agent might set up
a Yamcn of his own and reduce him. the
"Viceroy, to the position of a mere figure
head, t:ntil such time as the whole prov
ince, with its population of twenty mil
lions, should be openly annexed to Klao
chau. In the face of thl3 menace the Gov
ernor called upon the people to form
themselves Into a volunteer militia and
practice drill at home. The idea had first
taken root during the Japanese invasion
in 1S95.
The same thing was going on In the con
tiguous province of Chill. A great trunk
railway line had been- projected to con
nect Canton in the extreme south with
Peking In the extreme north, a distance
of over 2000 miles, crossing the River
Yangtse at Hankow. This was being en
ergetically rushed forward by Belgian en
gineers, who, by the spring of 1900. had
already a hundred miles open from Pe
king to Paotlng-fu. In another direction
from Tientsin northward to Shankalkwan
and Nluchwang, a system was growing up
in the hands of British and Russian en
gineers which would speedily connect the
imperial province of Manchuria with the
Trans-Siberian trunk line. This activity.
desecrating as It did all the superstitions
of the people, aroused a feeling of unrest
similar to that in Shantung. The Emperor
(In reality the Dowager Empress) Issued
an edict encouraging the people to form
themselves Into volunteer corps for the
defense of their homes. In this way the
Boxer organization was established.
Now as soon as the Imperial sanction
raised this secret society to the rank of
a national organization all the other
secret societies, heretofore as much
against the Emperor as against the mis
sionary, felt that their time was come to
revel in anarchy and bloodshed, "mey
would for the time being drop all notions
of rebellion and cloak their designs under
the patriotic cry. "Expel the foreigners.
They began with the native converts to
Christianity, slaughtering them wholesale.
The anti-foreign feeling once let loose,
the foreign Ministers at Peking wero
thunderstruck to perceive that China was
still as retrogressive as ever. All these
railways and telegraph poles. Instead of.
as they had fondly hoped, heralding the
dawn of a new civilization in China,
simply served as red rags to the bull of
fanaticism. Still they did nothing. Lega
tion street had for bo many years been
worried by the cry of wolf that It had
long since adopted the weary conviction
that nothing could be done and that If left
alone the trouble would die away of its
own accord. So. whenever a despairing
cry from some poor missionary who saw
his toll of years swept away in a mo
ment arrived they put it in a pigeon Lole
and politely hinted to the Tsung-H Yamen
that there appeared to be some slight dis
turbances In the provinces, and the Chi
nese Ministers as politely assented, with
the grave assurance that the usual im
perial edict would be forthcoming and
their excellencies need have no anxiety.
Such was the state of things at the date
â¢ Â«f t*i#Â» rnirine race meeting.
CHAPTER X\X
THE RACE MEETING.
The cup race- of the International Club
was the principal social event of the Pe
king legatloners during the month of
May. After that the tropical summer,
which followed close on the heels of win
ter, rendered riding uncomfortable, and
In June the ponies were put out to grass,
not to be brought back to the stables till
September. Apart from a little pig and
deer shooting In the winter, riding was
almost the only amusement of the young
men of Legation street. Every one kept
one pony: most, even of the youngest ju
niors on $100 a month, kept two, and a
considerable number of them kept quite
ambitious racing stables. Their mounts
were the sturdy Manehu ponies,. many of
which were descended from a cross by
the British cavalry mounts turned adrift
after the occupation or Peking In 1S60.
They came down in droves of shaggy
grass-blown mustangs or cayuses in a
virtually wild state, when the very smell
of a foreigner made them ungovernable,
bo that they could only be mounted by
first throwing a bag over their heads. In
this state they are called griffins. After
the Peking foreigners had taken their
pick, buying them at from $20 to $50, the
droves passed on to Tientsin, and thence
by steamer to- Shanghai, where they
fetched at auction from $30 to $100.
But no one would recognize the unkempt
grrlffln in the close-clipped, well-groomed,
superbly muscular form they presented
after a month or two of beans and wheat
and hard training. Then one saw that
the Mongolian pony makes one of the
best military mounts in the world. There
were upward of 200 of these spirited
beasts in the stables of Legation street.
This was noted by one of the great
princes Â¦who were wont to grace the
spring meeting with their presence.
"Do you see that, Yu?" he said to his
companion, as a score of young legation
men cantered on to the course, as spick
and. span as their ponies. "We could
equip a couple of squadrons of light cav
alry on those yang ma, which would ride
around any of those Cossacks they can
bring up for the first threo months at
least."

The winter had passed away and the
ice of the Pelho melted, bringing Peklns
once more in'touch with the outer world.
With the advent of the first steamer from
Shanghai, earning a swarm of merchants
for Tientsin and syndicate mongers for
Peking, the somber mediaeval atmos
phere, which had reasserted its sway dur
ing the closed months, seemed to be dis
sipated by the revivifying Influx of West
ern civilization and American enterprise.
But only at the first flush; old residents
of the north could not long shutUhetr
eyes to a something In the air, an unea*l
ness, a mysterious and ominous agitation
like that beneath the oily surface of a
whirlpool, which reminded some of tho
peculiar v symptoms which. In 1S70, had
preceded the massacre of Tientsin. On
that occasion China, always stolid and
impenetrable to, the outward eye, had been
convulsed in all its prejudices by a treaty
which had opened the interior to mission
aries; and the result, after two years of
Imperceptible seething; had been the sud
den and fanatic outbreak which resulted
In the barbarous killing* of a ecore or
more of Catholic nuns and priests, as well
as of the French Consul himself. Then
followed twenty years of acquiescence,
culminating in 1890 in a 'series '-of anti-
"And they would feed tha foreign devila
for thÂ« name length of time, after we
have cut off their provisions," responded
Tu gloomily.
"Ah, I am glad you mentioned that,
Ho-chl," eald the Prince. "We must see
to that when the time comes. "We must
pen them all up in one legation, hey?"
"That Is the first thing to do, your
Highness."
The man thus obsequiously addressed,
â¢who rode a. larce piebald pony, was a
swarthy and big-limbed Tartar, magnifi
cently clothed in semi-military costume,
and surrounded by a brilliant escort of
Manchu princes and Chinese mandarins.
A gloomy hatred seemed to hang on his
brow like a thundercloud as he j pat
haughtily watching the assembly of for
eign fashion in the grand stand opposite.
The foreign Ministers, as they trotted
past, bowed to such of the nobles aa they
were personally acquainted with, but .
without formality, since these in the
Prince's following were uninvited guests.
Invitations to the grand stand had Indeed
been issued, but had been ignored by the
Prince. Prince Ching. on the other hand,
together with such of the Tsung 11 Min
isters as could afford to defy the Tartar,
were to be seen in the inclosure sur
rounded by the brightly dressed women
of the legations.
Sir Claude Macdonald. a graceful cava
lier with melancholy face and sweeping
mustache, rode past, accompanied by Mr.
Conger and several ladles. He nodded fa
miliarly and indifferently to the Tartar no
bles, allowing them to see that they were
of far less importance to her Britannic
Majesty's representative than the
thoughtful, sturdy republican on one side
of him. and the brilliant Chicago belle on
the other.
"Who Is that farmer-like fellow who sits
5n his horse as If he -were a sack of rice?" s m^
nqulred the Prince.
"It Is the Flower Flag minister, your
Highness." replied the ex-Governor of
Shansl. "In America they never gallop,
secause their cavalry Is only used to per
form long marches."
"The man has a srood face," ?a!d the
FÂ»rince. who. outside his hereditary hatred,
was of generous nature. "These Ameri
cans. I understand, are not among our en
?mies."
"Net heretofore, your Highness. For

"Then you shall see to them when the

=oldler. contemptuously. "Provided they .

rious brother's garden, and have not laid
claim to any part of our territory. I bear
them no grudge." j
The- French and Russian ministers am- i
bled by. They bowed with great politeness \
Eiml flattering smiles, and their courtesy
Â»as returned In kind.
"These men are our worst enemies and
onr greatest friends, your Highness." said
Yu. "Fa-Gwo (Franco does not count
without O-Gwo (Russia), for she dare not
send her troops abroad and has. never
learned England's secret of maintaining
foreign possessions without expense. O-
Gwo is our neighbor to the north and de
sires to eat up the home of the glorious
dynasty (Manchuria). She employs tens of
thousands of our people to build the roads
of the steam-horse. Therefore. ehÂ» dreads
war. lest she should lose her Influence as
a friend, and she will not permit the other
nations to make war, lest in the con
fusion she should be numbered among ou*
enemies."
"Leave Russia to me." said the Prince,
grimly. "She will find when the day comes
that I have not spent twenty years on the
border for nothing."
"Oh, your Highness, Russia la our very
good friend." said Sheng. "She cannot
complete her railway or resist Japan
without our alliance, and will. If need be.
even join us in thrusting out the other
barbarians."
"How much do they pay you to say
that?" said the Prince with a grim smile.
"What words. Highness?" murmured
the old mandarin tremulously, and hla
rivals smiled and exchanged nods.
A slight, cold-faced gentleman, pre
cisely dressed, rode past, sitting stiffly
erect. He took no notice of the Prince
whatever.
"Very good, my friend." muttered the
Prince, his dark face growing purple un
der a sudden access of his ungovernable
temper. "By the tombs of my ancestor*!

A ROMANCE OF PEKINGFor the river people are a tabooed class.
Neither they nor their children for four
generatlons < after leaving the river may
hold office, and in every way they are
boycotted and ostracised to make their
existence a misery- All this just because
there is a tradition that once upon a time
some of the river people conspired against
the inland waters and sheltered inlets of
the coast. Whenever one of the3e
wretches loses the floating home which it
has taken a lifetime of savings to get.

and he usually plunges Into the Â«ea at

until now over most of the tillable parts
of the empire the fertile soil ha* been
used up clean and stripped away, leaving
but the br.rren. naked clay, incapable
of producing" good crops without
unusual and h^avy fertilization, peculiar
methods of cultivation and excessive ir
rigation. Their economics of production
are only equaled by their economics of
consumption. The very grass roots are
pulled from the ground to serve as fuel
and for use in paper-making. Every bit
of vegetable fiber Is pressed Into servtco
and the soil Is robbed of its mulch. Scraps
of paper and cloth are paste-i together to
make shoe soles, bits of wood are glued

By feigning Insanity he has the delight

service. A trifling crime will transport
him to a lovely seaside resort of the State,
with a flower gardened court, and Jus;:
enough labor to keep his appetite up to
an appreciation of the wholesome faro
provided. Should he scorn Insanity or
crime there Is still the comfortable poor

China makes no x such provision for
paupers. They may die and rot if they
cannot make their own living; there are
too many people anyway and the weakest
had best die off as soon as they can.
There Is not room on earth for them and
nobody is going to waste time coaxing
them to stay and lncumber the way for
hardier and stronger workers who with
health and muscle still have all they can
do to keep from getting pushed over the
edge.
The dragon well represents the imperial
Government of which It Is the symbol, a
hungry, ferocious, devouring monster,
clawing for all In sight and destroying
with breath of fire that which It cannot
secure to Itself.
No wonder that the paper gods of their
temples all have- devilishly malignant
faces. Fates are so unkind to the coolie .
that he can Imagine nothing but evil ta
exist among the unseen powers which
rule our being. Those who are crowded
off terra firma by the rampant land
lordism float\by millions In junks, house
boats and floating villages, which cover
the Government or some of Its official*.
Chinese women are. apparently suffer
ing from a similar tradition, for It Is said
by 6ome of the Chinese that women once
took up arms and attacked tha ruling
authorities, and for that reason It was
ordered that henceforth their feet should
bo crippled bo that there- might be- no
danger from them!" This, while an absurd
reason, seems more in line with Chinese
cowardice than any of the others which
are given for foot binding.
There Is consolation for the river folk
though In the fact that one acre of water
produces an infinite number of times
more food than an acre of land, for It has
three dimensions, while the land has but
two, and more than that the rivers have
the sea to draw from and there are con
tinually ascendfng them streams of food
fish from the Incalculable stores of the
ocean's depths. So the river people skim
the rivers of everything that Is In them,
using fish hunting birds, such as cor
morants, to search out such fish as may
have escaped the nets which are every
where cast without regard to time or sea

Patience Is another virtue which the
coolies have run clear Into the ground by
its excessive exercise. That very nega
tive virtue has been the cause of those
who exercise It being more and more
overloaded, until the Impositions placed
upon them crush out their Individual lives
and will presently end their national exist
ence. Â¦ Their patience has been provoca
tive of ferocity In their tormentors as the
mild sheep by running away Invites the
attack of dogs which had not otherwise
paid any attention, but by witnessing 1
such show of terror have thereby created
within them an appetite for mutton.

In the markets of Tungchow, to which
the stewards of the noble families of Pe

dogs to the slaughter house, for all of the
other dogs in the street, drawn by th^

In China the voracity of the people ob

It becomes rather a disgusting contempla

Bcarcely limited by tne extent of their
revenues, the voracity of the other un

food. Being the most omnivorous of all
people there Is not an animal or plant that
can be procured by art or Industry and
eaten without risk of life, which is not

subdue the coarser appetites of our na
ture. Such nations have the same natural
wants as their Eastern fellow creatures,
but the very refinement which conceals
them is also an auxiliary to the acquisi
tion of a supply of better quality.
There Is In almost every civilized coun
try a class who flaunt their poverty and
Chinese practices of the art of saving
are carried to extremes which are too
hopelessly pathetic to be comprehended
by us, the most favored and pampered
race of all humanity.
From this the rioting spread to a
revolt.
In talking with a fellow-passen
ger on tlxe China Mr. Go forth gave
the following striking story of the
awful poverty which.is gnawing at
the vitals of the masses in China,
and is the real source of their dis
content.
y NT the theory and practice of poverty
I Asia FurpaF?es herself, and the Chi
li nese coolies have made It a fine art.
Asia, the lurid continent, leads In ev
erything. All of the religions of the world
come from thereâ Christian, Jewish. Mo
hammedan. Buddhist, Confucian, and
nearly ell others of "the two and seventy
Â«ects."
The greatest hoards of both wealth and
wisdom are stored In the region east of
Buez, and around them stretch Inco-mpre
fcensibJe wastes of Ignorance and poverty,
the like whereof Is not elsewhere on the
face of the globe: so great, too, that It
xtiev In time swallow our entire civiliza
tion and leave but a blot In history which
will be known as the second dark age.
It does not follow thai the acquisition of
food is an object of less anxious atten-
A sufficient supply of wholesome food
seems to be the influencing power, the
end of all Industry In every art of the
globe, and the difference in the degrees of
avidity with which mankind pursue It is
regulated by the degree of civilization and
Intelligence which they have attained. .
Poverty's struggle for existence has
compelled these people to eat almost
every substance which is not deadly poi
son, and there is little doubt that the
narcotics with which the Asiatic dulls his
misery were discovered while some
6tarver was trying to etay his stomach
with herbs. Our wellfed American farmer
never becomes acquainted by original in
vestigation with the therapeutics of the
flora on his farm. All knowledge of the
medical properties of herbs comes from
the aborigines who were oft driven by
cruel hunger to taste every bark, root and
leaf In the search for alimentary products
of the earth.
Whether or not added poverty brought
upon the Chinese by the Indemnities
which the allies are going to collect will
deprive them of even the trifling solace
of the cricket and compel them to rely
upon the music of caged mosquitoes to
remind them of the country Is a question
that will be settled In the law foundries
of Europe, where destinies of barbarian
hordes are cast to mold.
vlda. Catching crickets and selling them

his etart In life.
work, they have always had greÂ«.t ambi
tion to become heavy exporters, which,
means that they are, anxious to do tho
work of others as well, for a large export
trade la nothing else. Think how many
backaches It takes to produce a shipload,
of tea, for Instance, and then wonder at
the Industry which can accomplish It and
the patience which It takes to contem
plate such a herculean task without
shrinking.
The one beauty of their poverty Is thÂ»
extreme simplicity of life to which It has
led them. Their meals are but rice, al
though boiled In a way that no European
can accomplish, and which they will not
practice unless cooking for themselves;
then a light, watery vegetable something
like a cross between our cabbage and let
tuce; with this tea. and thÂ« same thins
for every meal twice a day the year
round, except at new year.
Clothes are as simple as the food. Two
garments of cotton are all that tho coolla
has, except hat and shoes, to put on In,
the morning: then he Is dressed. It Is this
which makes early rising so general In
the land of the rising sun. for It ts thÂ»
horror of dressing rather than the fond
ness of sleep which keeps most of us In
bed.
Though they wear no underclothing, yet
the homespun, close-woven garments ara
warm, comfortable and healthy, as there
Is room for plenty of air circulation out
side the body and plenty of blood circu
lation within It. for lack of which we civ
ilizees suffer more from cold and colds
than from all of our bad climates put to
gether.
Perhaps In. those two attainments of
simplicity the lurid continent has, repaid,
itself for all of the sufferings undergone
in the practice of poverty as a Sno arc
together to ra&kp a board or pfflar.
Not satisfied with doing all of their own
Venders of strange viands step from
their junks to the shore, having baskets
suspended on a carrying pole, in which
are contained dogs, cats, rats or birds
either, tame or wild, generally alive; sea
slues and grubs found in the sugar cane.
The species of dogs most in request is a
Fmall spaniel. The poor animals appear
particularly dejected In their Imprison
ment, not even looking up In the hope of
freedom; while the cats, on the contrary,
keep up an Incessant squalling and seem
never to despair of escaping.
Eagles, storks, hawks and owls are
among the rarities displayed by poulter
ers, but the popular fowl In China is the
duck, which well adapts itself to the
crowded condition of the land, and takes
to the water almost from birth. The
peasants hatch the eggs in an oven or
manure heap. When the ducklings are
able to be removed, they are taken in a
boat to the nearest mudbank or heap
where, shellfish feed. There they paddle
around the fording grounds and commence
a daylong search for everything digesti
ble, paddling back at night to their con
veyances, in which they are returned
home.
Even the Chinese in America still hank
er after the fleshpots of Chung Kwn.
and wild cats find ready sale to the Chi
nese poulterers and also to the Italian
marketmen having stall3 near Chinatown.
The coolies of the Middle Kingdom
re.ally get so poor that it requires an al
, gebralc equation to express the mlnus
neBs o'f their financial condition. !;Â¦ x; r i
The poorest European beggar has him
self and usually a family, generally a
large one. Beggars are Inclined that way.
The Lord loves poor people, and so makes
many of them. Â«
But the beggar of Europe Is wealthy In
that he has. his freedom and family; the
Chinese coolie has sold himself, and us
ually his family as well.
With all those who are dear to him in
bondage of his own creation, himself sold
and powerless to aid them, life is a long
bitter day for him and he never fears to
part with it. So little is it his own that
ho is really less concerned than the
haughty master who rules his destiny.
If patience, humility, economy, indus
try, thrift, frugality and obedience are
virtues which will receive reward, then \*
vthe Chinese coolie the most blessed of
all mortals. Those virtues have at least
made him what he Is, for none can say
that he does not possess them In the
highest degree. The coolie Is a good il
lustration of the saying that the" less you
Bpend the less you will have.
Ho Is 'a shining example of what comes
of following the advice of Poor Richard's
Almanac and other advisers of that whin
ing school of skim-milk philosophy. His
poverty Is, as has been shown, a minus
quantity. He has lost all he had and
half as much more, like the man In tho
algebra book who Juzzled our youth by his
woeful losses. For If the coolie could

ODD CORNERS IN ARTISTIC HOMES.Mlss Laughllnâ Not at all. I think thÂ»
trouble is this: That when a woman does
work outside of the house she Is expected
to look after her house, too. In other
words, she is expected to do the work of
two and inevitably she must fall some
where. What is needed is that the care
of children and of the house should be
recognized as a profession in iteelf. If a
.woman chooses to have children, then I
think the care of her children while they
are young should be her profession, but
It by no means follows that it is the des
tiny of every woman to enter the profes
sion of housekeeping. And It Is to 'be re
membered, too, that a man has some du
ties as a father and some responsibility
in common with the mother for the mak
ing of a home. :':^y. J

Miss Laughllnâ -It Is interesting to sen

does the work of her house she is not
considered to be entitled to any payment.
Not even the law rc^ornlzes her services
as being of money value, but gives her
household labor to her husband without
money and without price. But when a
woman leaves her house to do other work,
then her service In the house Is consid

Mrs. Gftffneyâ The church has not given

her to do.

that it was one of the few points J>Z
activity permitted to women, the oth
ers being the sewing society, the do

Ml*s Laughllnâ Yea; in the past the only
field for women's activities was the rear-
Ing of children and participation in church
matters. They had to hava some field for
their energies, and the church was the
only channel for the outlet of their ener
gies. Now "there are others," as they

meet every week to sew for the heathen
It was not because they cared so much
for the heathen or for sewing, but be
cause they wanted to meet with other
women, to have a little life outsida of the
four walls of their own houses.
Mrs. Gaffneyâ A woman thought that to
belong to a certain church was an essen
tial to respectability. When as a young
woman" I came to New York I was told
to Join a certain churchâ advice given not
with a view to my eternal salvation, but
as a social step.
You would then consider tho
churches that our mothers and grand
mothers attended with such devotion
more in the light of social centers than
religious shrines? - ; '^
Mrs. Gaffneyâ Yes; you met socially the
peoplo who went to your church. You
met some people .outside, of course, but
you depended mainly for society upon the
people who went to your particular
church.
Mrs. Hanafordâ Not the sole social cen
ter, because family ties and neighborhood
facilities have their influence to form cen
ters.
In village and country society the
church still constitutes tha chief so
cial center, does it not?
Mrs. Garmeyâ No; there is a universal
reaching out of 'women to. other sources
of social life and intercourse. I find that
Mrs. Hanafordâ I believe that women
have that very work given into their
hands. Women have been earnest in their

Miss Laughllnâ The interests of men and

identified with some particular work than

equally affected by the results.
Mrs. Gaffney â \Vcmen are always crea

which occurs to m -i bearing on tnis ques
tion, but I cannot. However, in some
part of Revelation there is this: "I saw
ro temple therein." (Mrs. Gaflney refers
to Revelation xxi:22.) I oncÂ« heard
a very Impressive strraon on this text
and tl.e dr-duction was that the religion
of Christ would Home time place man so
nearly in accord with God that the visible
church would be no longer needed. What
is the use of a church and a system of
theology if It does not gradually lift man
to where he no longer n^ods reminders
and props toward duty? What would we
say if we were to call in a pnyslclan who
continued to administer the same remedy
and the patient showed no improvement?
Do you think it will be woman, after
allâ that is, advanced, enlightened
womanâ who will one day reconstruct
them tne truth. And they will still belors,
to that devoted class of followers of Jesus
who were "lart at the cross and earliest
at the grave."
Mrs. Gaffneyâ I am glad you insist upon
the Independence of men and women, Mlrs
Laughlin. It is frequently asserted, you
know, that women in the professions want
to drop men out of all consideration and
run society alone.
MIps Laughlinâ That position seems to
me to be very illogical. The entrance of
women Into Industrial and professional
life means that women are doing more of
the work of the world; that they are be
coming more interested in the things In
which men are interested. The result
must be closer relations rather than fur
ther separation. It is those who believe
In separate spheres for men and women
who would make a chasm between men
and women.
But is not that Just the position that
women have taken?
Miss Laughllnâ I believe that is the
position which has been attributed-* to
them by those opposed to the advance
ment of women, in order to discredit the
movement, rather than that assumed by
any who are working for wider opportuni
ties for women.
But is woman's entry Into the profes-
Flona not a bad thing for the men?
Mrs. Gaffneyâ In what way?
That they are away from the family
all day and therefore cannot give tho
came attention to their homes that the
"old women" for generations have

in Iowa, in an outlying country district,
a band of women have formed what they
call a Chauncey Depew Club. They' are
far removed from any of the ordinary fa
cilities for feminine enjoyment, and tho
neighborhood churches are not sufficient
unto their needs for social relaxation, so
they are going to become debaters.
Are there as many women engaged
In the active work of the church to
â¢ day as there were, say, even ten years
ago?
Miss Laughlin â To speak of the church as
" Â«n organization, I would say no. I do not
think there are proportionately a3 many
engaged in tha work of the church as
before, but I think that women are do-
Ing: more work which belongs to true re
ligion than ever before. They are doing
philanthropic and charitable work which
the church ought to do. but which the
.. church does not do and has not done.
Mrs. Hanafordâ There are more women
to-day at work in churches than ever be
fore, partly because there is more oppor
tunity for work, and partly because it has
become fashionable to engage in such em
ployments as slum work, college settle
ments, etc.. reminding one of the text.
"The rich and the poor meet together; the
Lord is the maker of them all." I. re
joice In this state of things, because It
gives the opportunity for Jew and Gentile,

lifting of humanity.
It would soem, then, would It not.
that the women who are doing the
really pood and great work !n religion
and philanthropy are doing it entirely
apart from the church?
Miss Lnughlinâ Not altogether outside
the church, but the college settlement and
most of the practical philanthropies are
not connected with any church.
Mrs. Hanafordâ AH work done for the
benefit of humanity Is, in a sense, re
ligious work. It is not theological or
ecclesiastical work, and It is wise to
make a wide distinction between theology
and religion.
Because women have allowed their
Interest to fine In the work of the
church, is It the fault of the church
and not of the women?
Miss Lauehlinâ The so-called "Institu
tional church" Is what the church ought
to be. We have got beyond the day when
religion, meant the putting forth of dead
the church?
Miss Laughlinâ It is going to help the
church to a broader religionâ something
better than the religion of to-day, with its
narrow creeds, over which the churches
quarrel. There Is every evidence to-day
that women are more closely connected
with truly religious work than ever be
fore. Eelifilon does not consist merely
of talking or of going- to church.
Mrs. Hanaford â Forms may change, but
the Christ spirit and life will endure.
Creeds may be modified, but the.leader

The test of true religion will be Been to

Do we not then come to tlie con
clusion that the direction is toward a
universal religionâ that is. that tho
present religious movements are work

barriers between the people and dog
matism?
Mrs. Gaffneyâ I believe there is pres

but a blow to knock them all down. I
wish I could give a chapter and verse
women are turning away from the church,
then the trouble must lÂ« with the church.
Mrs. Hanaford â The "new woman" a
menace to religion? Not at all. In fact
the churches depend largely on women
for existence. The majority of church
members In Protestant ranks are women,
and In other churches the devotees are as
likely to be women as menâ in fact more
likely, since women are more sentimental
paturally, more devout, more affected by
the teachings of the puiplt. more Inclined
to obey and to sacrifice, even when taught
as the apostle teaches, 'hat "obedience is
better than sacrifice." Woman's devotion
to duty Is proverbial, and tho club Woman

sincerity of such governing bodies, and
for that very reason we are learning to

Miss Laughlinâ No. I do not think it la

more spiritual than men.

Mrs. Gaffney â I have not seen It.
Miss Laughllnâ I believe there la a
movement in that direction. The Metho

the General Conference. That Is one step.
Other churches are recognizing women
more and more. There certainly Is a
movement in that direction, though a very
slow movement.
Mrs. Hanaford â Women hava always
been recognized as equal among the- Quak
ers. All my childhood I listened to more
women preachers than to men. One of tho

days, till Bishop Kastburn of Massachu
setts declared It to be etjual to thÂ« grand

her words were words of divlnest truth.
In many other churches there are now
women ministers. The Rev. Antoinette
Brown Black well was the first woman or
dained to the ministry. The Rev. Olym
p'a Brown and the IJev. Augusta Chapin,

I was oruaineH In ISO, eight men minis

ThÂ» movement is slow, presumably
because it is human nature to be con
servative in matters of religious faith,
especially when it comes to disregard

ar.d eo r.ovel were they that they have
aroused a good deal of discussion among
the members of the Academy of Medicine
Jn Paris.
Dr. Chatlniere a short time ago treated
twelve children who had measles accord
ing to this new method, which is scien
tifically known Â£5 phototherapie. Red light
was the only cure which he used, and this
he made serviceable In the following man
rer: On the window? of the sick rooms
he bong red curtains, and on the table
near each bed he placed a lamp which
cave .fcrth a red llsht. He acted thus be
cause he felt satisfied that the Irritation
cf the f=Lin in cases of measles is due to
the chemical rays of the solar spectrum
or, in other words, to the ultra violet
rayp, Fir.d not to the no-called caloric or
heat rays. If this were not so, how ac
count for the fact that the pustules and
Fears are especially deep and marked on

he had not erred In arriving at this con
clusion. ' His little patients rapidly re
pair.ffl their health, and the virtue that
JSes in red curtains ar.d rrd lamps is being
extolled by many physicians.
Impressed, like Dr. Chatlniere, by the
fact that the influence of the solar rays
is especially manifested on the faces and
hands of patients, Dr. Finsen conceived
the Idea of subjecting persons suffering
from cma!!pox to the influence of ultra
violet ray?, which reached them after
the light had been filtered through thick
red curtains. The result was that the lit
tle vesicles or bladders gradually disap
peared and the patients did not suffer
from the customary fever and, further
more, were not pockmarked. The ultra
violet rays, indeed. In the case of these
patients produced practically the same ef
fect BS the red light In that of Dr. Chati
rleres', the most notable tokens of their
efficacy belns the absence of fever and
restiessneFs and the gradual disappear
ance of the eruptions before coming to
maturity. It was also noticed that the
rays had a marked effect on the maladies
In to far as they affected the bronchial
lubes.

Last winter one of the largest elephant*
in the herd was afflicted with a toothache
and began to behave In a way that wor
ried her caretakers. While the elephant
Is docile and generally good natured, he
is a mighty bad proposition If In a bed
mood. No one knows this better than
circus people. When an elephant snlks
and quits eating heartily they bests tÂ»
suspect trouble, and the employes keep
an anxious watch that never ceases.
Everybody knows that amiability does not
thrive upon toothache. The drcus people
did not want to lose this animal, as they
would have to if she began to exit up on
account of temper, so they sought tha
advice- of a well-known New York den
tist. Dr. Richmond. He decided to fill tha
tooth. To kill the- nerve was no easy
task and kept everybody nervously ex
pectant. The elephant Is a wise- animal,
and when she found that the attention shs
was getting relieved her pain she took
kindly to the performance and bellowed
cheerfully. Special tools had to be mads
for cleaning, grinding out the cavity and
filling It. After tho amalgam was put In

the other day, . having nearly completed
her hundredth, year, had. during: her

genuousiy termed the "Earth Mirror." It
Is also called the crystal ball or Arda

lers, sightseers and treasure seekers. It
Is claimed that some persons are gifted
with a natural-born talent that by looking
through one of these crystals they are en
abled to foretell great events and hidden
things." The advertisement adds: â "Any
body that wants one, we have them put
up in nice plush packed cases. Price, $10,
postpaid." Â¦ '
The credulity of mankind, or certain
species of mankind, Is certainly proved
by the foregoing. The buying and sell
ing divining rods and gold bricks of va
rious degrees will continue until the end
of time. P. T. Barnum, when he made his
famous remark "A new fool Is born every
minute," based It on a long experience
with human nature.
ime a compass, in the center is a needle
supposed to indicate the depth of the hid
den treasure or mine.
There Is also another Instrument, called
in the catalogue the new goldometer. It
is described as a "new invention for the
convenience of prospectors, miners and
treasure seekers. The goldometer is heav
ily charged and sealed with the strong
est ingredients for discovering gold, sil
ver, hidden treasures and other minerals
In the earth. It Is very powerful in locat
ing a spot of underground treasure, as its
magnetic force always Â¦works perpendicu
lar, while rods which mark both perpen
dicular and horizontal at the same time
are not as powerful as the goldometer in
determining the exact spot of the treas
ure or body of mineral. It Is so construct
ed that it can be easily used in every nook
and corner." and Is conveniently put up in
a strong leather case, with full directions
as to use. Price, by express, $15."
One of the most Interesting items In tha
catalogue from a psychological point ot
view Is an advertisement of Â¦***>â¢ hat Is in-
other words, that he had decided to go
Into the business himself.
Heading the list of testimonials in this
remarkable catalogue is what purports to
be Â«*n extract from a New York evening
paper. It possibly Is genuine, but a close
reading proves that It is not, after all,
Euch a strong testimonial In favor of the
divining rod. The extract is headed
"Minerals Located by Magnetic Needles,"
and it runs as follows:
"The magnetic needle has long been
considered a reliable medium for defining
the locations of veins containing mineral
or other similar deposits, and in the
course of some experiments recently con
ducted by Professors Rucket and Thorpe
and other eminent scientists some re
markable confirmations of and additions
to the theories hitherto held on the sub
ject were achieved. It was found that on
approaching an area beneath which min
erals were deposited tho needle became
deflected.
"In cases where tTie mineral was near
to tne surface thÂ» deflection was most
acute, and where It was hidden far below
the surface the degree of deflection was
accordingly diminished, so that by care
fully noting: the movements of the needle
it was possible not only to fix the exact
locality Â¦where iron was to be found, but
also, according to the degree* of deflec
tion, to fix with tolerable accuracy the
depth at which the vein would be met." Â£2
It will be seen that only one mineral Is
mentioned in this extract, and that min
eral one seldom sought after by people
who purchase divining rods at $20 per rod.
The most sancuine farmer would not
care to waste his time looking about un
der hayricks and In the old "me'dder" for
Iron depoeits. It is evident this crafty
dealer in modern gold bricks has a very
poor opinion of his customers as men of
intelligence.
The business of manufacturing and sell-
Ing divining rods is the direct outcome of
the ancient belief in the value of the hazel
or peach rod. It Is generally believed that
wooden rods of the material mentioned
will aid In tho discovery of hidden springs
ot water, ana in some parts or tne united
States, especially in the South, the rural
classes concede the power of finding min
erals to the hazel and peach rods. The
present day dealers in mineral rods and
their adjuncts have enlarged upon the old
superstition, and, as proved by the sta
tistics of this peculiar trade, they have
found the business remunerative.
Many classes of rods are manufactured,
ranging in price from $10 to $25. The dif
ference is in the length and finish. The
cheaper rod Is two feet three inche's over

Is its power to pick up a needle or a small

-'""-.ducting a business transaction. There

*Â»n an everyday commercial basis. But
the farmer or villager who invests in a

below that of a Dipper Indian. Alas for
our species!â there are many of them.
Frcm a Per.nsrlvan'a town, not the
smallest in the State, comes a catalogue
advertising the business of a dealer In
Cirfaicg rods and their edjunctn. The
catalogue shows signs of prosperity. It

to farmers with afflicted intellects.
In thla catalogue are also testimonials

"nerve" cannot be surpassed. To quot"*

condition of mental obliquity almost be
yond belief. It Is a record of dense lg

FrÂ«->rn a town In Georgia, under date of

to the proprietor of the catalogue. It In
literally as follows:

J. A. SparkSeld of Mississippi proffers a
testimonial delicious In its wording. He

"Drr.r Sir: This is to certify that the
instrument I bought from you about a
year ago works like a charm. Send me a
catalogue of all the Instruments you have
In stock. Do you have any that will
locate nothing but money?"
The naive simplicity of the last sentence
of Mr. SparknVld's letter cannot be eur
pawfd. He apparently does not care to
bother with srold or silver In their crude
rtate. His desire is for an Instrument that
Â¦v.iJI !:nd money ready for use. It Is easy
to conjure a vision of this man searching
the by-lanes ar.d meadows of Mississippi
for hurled coin.
A man living In Forest City. Ark., writes
under date of January 13, 1&5S, to this ef
fect:
"Dear Sir: After a long time I write you
a. few linos to Inform you that I received
my rod all right and can find money any
where with It. I have sold it and want to
know v. hat you will sell me another like It
for. I can sell half a dozen of them."
An analysis of this letter leads to very
peculiar results. The writer says in the
epace of a brief letter that he received the
rod a long time ago. and. although he
eould find money anywhere wkh It. had
fold the rod. It seems hardly probable
that an Instrument possessing the In
valuable virtue cf finding money any
where would be sold. The fact that thH
citizen of Forest City had discovered that
he could sell half a dozen of the mineral
rods would imply that he had taken a leaf

HOW THE AMERICAN
FARMER FOOLED OUT
OF THOUSANDS
SEEKING WATER AND
BURIED TREASUREJailor- Made Cosiume of the Empress Jsi Hsi.
THE EMPRESS TSI HSI la
full of the devil's favorite
sin, "the pride which apes
humility."
â¢ When young and with only her
face as h-er fortune she did not scru
ple to avail herself of every trick and
charm which could be derived from
her habiliments.
Now Tsi Ssi, a ruler by her brains,
coarse and. arrogant, styles herself
the only man-in China, and following
the manner of tho ladies of the West,
rigs herself out in a . Marichu . tailor
made gown. To this same simplicity
she has also reduced the four first
class, the twenty-seven second class
and the. eighty-one third class wives
of the young Emperor, so that no lady
of the palace shall have any oppor
tunity of trading upon her personal
beauty in order to gain favor In the
intrigues of the court.
For months the plans were being ma
tured and letters and documents were
prepared and gradually accumulated in
places where they were afterward dlscov- .
ered.
Tho eve of the day when the plotters'
coup was to be made, Yuen SI Kal. com
muning with himself, saw the wickedness
of what Kang Yu Wai had planned, that
it was murder and not reform which he
was about to accomplish, so ho made up
his mind -to expose Kang.
Too late to enter the Forbidden City,
he changed his mind. The soldiers were
already within. At Kang's command they
would in the morning blindly do his bid
ding and exterminate the oldest of living.
The Governor determined that his ac
tions had been wrong. Late at night ho
caused the gates to be forced that h<s
might obtain audience with the people of
the palace.
It was useless to appeal to tho young
Emperor, as Kang would Indirectly hear
of It
Tho only person, then, in whom resided
the power to stop the. carnage which
Kang bad planned, was her Majesty, the
Dowager Empreaa. To hÂ«r thd Governor
laid bare the plot. At a hasty conference
It was decided to let the coup go on aa
planned, but with Kang and his co-con
eplrators as the objects of its vengeance.
So it was planned and as planned it
occurred. Kang was the victim of his
own well planned coup. Kwang Su was
placed on the. throne by reason of hia
progressive and intelligent spirit, which
he displayed at a phenomenally early
period of his youth, and the Empress had
always been Regent.
When, however, his adviser, Kang Yu
Wai, had attempted to turn his reform
unto revolution it was considered advis
able that her Majesty should for a time
aid in the administration of affairs to put
an end to Kang's conspiracy.
Kang has borne a charmed life. The
seizure of the reformers was made at
night, yet he escaped in disguise to
Shanghai. There he went on board of a
British boat, and although pursued by
several" Chinese men of war, the English
officers refused to surrender him, not
knowing, perhaps, what was his offense.
- He is now at j tho head of tho reform
party end It is not for tho reason that
the reformers '. wish \ to ' modernize *' China.,
but because they have at their head a
traitor and would-be regicide, that the
Imperial government of the Middle King
dom keeps such close and Jealous watch
upon their movements.
. Now that it may be known how came
the stories of tho coronation of a new
Emperor In place of Kwang Su.
He had married at the age of 16 a beau
tiful princess, most blessed in gifts of the
gods of all of three hundred of the most
noble daughters of the Manchu nobles,
who were presented at the palace for se
lection. 1 ;V './y.
Yet though she- was so fair to see she
was denied tho one great blessing of a
Chinese wifeâ a son.
By the law of the kingdom if the Em
peror have no son at the age of 30 years
he may choose for" himself an. heir from
the sons of royal blood.
-''Therefore it was the ceremony of the
selection of tho heir that set the mag
pies of the palace to chattering, and those
who knew. not Bald that a new Emperor
had bean chosen.
,. A price is still on the head of the traitor
Kang and upon the heads of those who
conspired, with Wm.. Kwang Bu. yet Uvea
HER imperial Majesty, Dowager
Empress of the Middle Kingdom,
believing that the time has now
come when It is necessary to break
the custom of silence which has bound
her empire's rulers for near 5000 yeara,
rr.akep this statement, not for her self
defense, but as a Justification of her peo
ple, who. refusing to be led by false coun
selors, are Buffering unmerited penalties.
Never before has It been necessary for
a regent or Emperor of China to intrude
upon the world a relation of those mat
ters which properly concern In th*Â»lr ad
ministration only the Internal .depart
ments of the' Government.
There v.as one who was Intrusted at
the palace with the counseling and higher
education of his Majesty.
This man, placed so close to the source
of power, became blinded and dizzy. He,
Kang Yu Wai, self-styled reformer, was
a conspirator who planned murder whole
sale to make himself a sovereign power.
Kang formed a conspiracy with Tuen
El Kai, now Governor of Shantung, who
was then the head of the palace guards.
It was^ arranged that the soldiers were to
be brought together for the ostensible pur
pose of drilling them within the- walls;
that at a given signal they were to rush

great open-air meeting. His speech waa
an impassioned arraignment of the oppo
nents of the war in South Africa, in tho
course of which he said:
"I waa going to call thorn traitors, but
I will Instead say misguided individuals."
Mr. Chamberlain challenged the Liber
als to point out a single provocative word
or sentence In the dispatches exchanged
during the ante-war negotiations He
charged the Boers with having broken
every pledge and promise made to thtv
British and declared that they had long
been planning to kick the English out of

ness. The country, he said, wanted tr>

they were Inaccurate. It was audacious
to assume that If the soldiers were back
from South Africa they would vote for
the opposition. The speaker appealed to
the country not to put the settlement of

"Nineteen of our collieries are at work
this morning and twenty are idle. The
idle ones are those about Shamokin, Ma
haney City and S-henandoah. In the last
two named districts our men generally
worked yesterday. They were attacked
by Poles and other rioters as they went
home and many of them were injured.
"So far as we are informed, our men

PARADE OF MENU EMPLOYES.
Many of the Boys in I,ine Are of
Very Tender Age.
SCRANTON, Pa., Sept. 22.â A parade of
2000 slate pickers, runners, drivers, door
tenders and helper^ from the mines of
Scranton and vicinity was the feature of
to-day. The parade was planned by Or
ganizer Dllcher.to show how mariy chil
dren who ought to be in school were
forced Into the mine by reason of their
fathers being paid such poor wages. It
was a sight that would move the hardest
heart. Fully a third of the boys in line
appeared to be about 9 or 10 years of age,
and inquiry among them elecited the start
ling fact that not a few 8-year-old chil
dren were numbered in the parade.
A mass meeting followed at Laurel Hill
Park, at which addresses .were made by
H. McCarty of San Francisco and others.
The burden of their talk was an appeal
to the strikers to avoid being driven to
acts of disorder. â¢
An address was sent to strike headquar
ters at noon by President Mitchell," ap-.
pealing to the miners to continue their
good behavior and avoid being agitated
by emissaries of the companies who
through the United Mine Workers' or
ganization, together with bringing the
militia to the scene, haa set the strikers
to thinking and they realize that the bat
tle is apparently going against -.them.
The washeries, which operated all the
week, are still going. No disorder haa
broken out anywhere in this region. The
men are peaceable and are remaining
away from the mines.

DEPUTIES GUARD COLLIERIES.
Arrival of Militia Said to Have
Calmeu the Strikers.
HAZLETON, Pa., Sept. 22.-Calmnes3
prevailed throughout the Lehigh region
this morning. There is still intense feel
ing in the public mind, but the sending of
troops to Shenandoah, twenty-five miles
from here. Is generally regarded as bring
ing matters to a crisis, and the situation
here 3 is therefore somewhat relieved.
Armed deputies are distributed near most
of the collieries and along public roads
leading to mining properties. There was
the usual number of strikers out early
this morning, trying to persuade workers
not to go into the mines, but they did not
meet with as much success as on the pre
vlous days of the week. Strikers were
careful not to carry their persuasion to
the point of intimidation, thus avoiding a
conflict with the deputies. So long as the
idle men in this district, who number more
than 14,000, refrain from gathering In large
crowds and- marching from town to town,
there Is little likelihood of a general dis
turbance.
The situation Is practically unchanged.
The Markle mines at Jeddo and Oakdale
are working with an increased force and
the company is making every effort to get
all its men back. There is a considerable
number of watchmen on the company's
property, and the Sheriffs deputies are
within easy reach. Mr. Markle says he Is
determined to give all the men in his em
ploy who desire to work a chance to do
so, and adds that he will protect them if
it takes the entire military force of Penn
sylvania to accomplish it.
There was danger of trouble at Sandy
Run early this morning. "*na hundred
men from Freela.nd went there at 3 o'clock
to stop the F. C. Kemmerer colliery from
starting up. There was a parley near
tho colliery* and the strikers agreed to let
the men work on the promise that they
will not return to the mines Monday
morning.
The men and women of McAdoo were
OPERATORS MAKE REPLY
TO PRESIDENT MITCHELL
WILKESBARRE, Pa., Sept. 23.â The operators here, in reply to the open letter, of
President Mitchell of the United Mine-Workers, make this statement:
"Mr. Mitchell's demands simply mean a recognition of Mitchell. There are indica
tions that he is weakening and ready to fall down. Defeat stares him in the face and the
strikers are beginning to realize the true situation of affairs. It is cropping out all over the
strike region. The men want to return to work. The claim of Mr. Mitchell and other lead
ers of the United Mine- Workers that no depredations would be committed while they were
in charge of the strike has been nullified by the acts of the men at Shenandoah. The leaders
are unable to control the unruly element."
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 22. â At the end of the first week of the strike in the coal fields of Pennsylvania there are not wanting signs ot a desire on the part of some of the strikers to return to their
work. This sentiment is generally c onfined, so far as reported, to the English-speaking .element among the mine-workers. Experience has shown that these men are the most conservative, the foreigners being impulsive
and hot tempered in strike times. Notwithstanding. the serious outbreak necessitating the sending of troops to Schuylkill County, everything is reported quiet jn the entire coal region to-night. There is a feeling that
efforts will be made in all districts Monday to start mines that are now idle. The persistence of corporations and individualmine-owners in asserting that they will consider grievances of their employes individuallv, but
will never under any circumstances treat with the United Mine-Workers, has undoubtedly had its effect, and it would not be surprising if many mines that have been closed since the strike began resume operations, at least
partially, the beginning- of next week.

The arrival of the troops occasioned

ON SIDE OF THE STB.IKERS
Statements Issued by Father Phillips
and Mitchell.
HAZLETON. Pa., Sept. 22.â All Is quiet
and orderly in this region to-night. Presi
dent Mitchell of the United Mine Work
ers to-night issued a statement giving his
views on the calling out of troops at
Bher.andoah and the killing of a miner
by deputies at Shenandoah. The statement
Bays :
"From information I have received from
those who have Investigated the situation
it appears that the ehooting on the part
of the Sheriff ar.d his deputies was en
tirely uncalled for. Inasmuch as the strik
ers had not injured a slngls member of
the Sheriff's posse, and the circumstance
forcibly illustrates the ruthless disregard
the Sheriff and his deputies have for the
lives of persons whom it was their plain
duty to place under arrest If they had
violated any of the laws cf the State.
The Governor In calling out the Stale
troops has, in xny judgment, acted with
out investigation- I am confident that the
miners who are on strike are fully Im
pressed with the necessity of observing
the law and conducting themselves in a
peaceful manner at all times."
Father Phillips, who has worked dili
gently for arbitration as a means of set
tling the 6trike. to-night Issu?d a state
ment in which he comes out flatly on tho
side of the strikers.

ommended for the boys, as well as the

PARIS, Sept. 22.-A state of open war
fare exists between the Municipal Council
and the Government. This was made ap
parent to-day by the publication of a let
ter from* the Premier, M. Waldeck-Rous
seau, declining all direct communication
with the Council.
The conflict has been simmering since
the Nationalists' victory at the late elec
tions and the choice of the militant Na
tionalist, M. Grebauval, as President of
the Council. The latter began hostilities
shortly after he assumed office by offer
ing an affront to President Loubet and M
A\ aldeck- Rousseau by ostentatiously leav
ing the festival in the garden of the Tuil
erles at which they were present. The
Nationalist press warmly approved this
action on the part of M. Grebauval.
. The Government's first reply was Its
failure to invite representatives of the
municipality to attend the unveiling of
the Washington and Lafayette monu
ments in this city and other like incidents
followed. Then came the municipality
projected fetes In honor of all the Mayors
of France, in connection with which
President Loubet refused to receive the
town officials, who were to offer him an
invitation, as the fete was obviously
Intended as a demonstration against
the Government. The latter, moreover
through the medium of the Prefects of the
Seine and Paris, strangled the fete by in
forming Mayor Grebauval that he had
no authority to issue Invitations; except
conjointly with the Prefects. M. Gre
bauval, thus humiliated and finding' that
most of the replies to his invitations were
refusals, in which the writers reproved
him for working to undermine the re
public, abandoned the fete. The Govern
ment cleverly retorted by announcing that
the people of Paris would not lose by the
abandonment, for the arrangements be
gun by the municipality would be carried
through under the auspices of the expo
sition authorities.
The next development In the duel was
a renewed bid for popularity by deciding
that the sum originally, allotted for the
expense of the mayoral fete should be
distributed among the poor of the various
wards. Then, it is stated, the municipal
ity asked an Interview with M. Waldeck-
Rousseau In order that they might dis
cuss a new municipal bill which would
make the municipality more Independent
This application was made by the Vice
President,, and M. Â¦ p Waldeck-Rousseau's
response published to-day, Is the last and
most serious phase of the struggle.
M. Waldeck-Rousseau did not even
write to the Vice President dlreat, but to
the Prefect of the Seine, whom he asked
to inform the Vice President that his ap
plication Is refused. .
The Premier points out that M. Grebau
val has broken all relations with him
He says it is difficult to allow the Munici
pal Council to bo represented by the Vice
President when It desires to enter into
communication with the Government and
by the President when It Is a question of
insulting i It. M. Waldeck-Rousseau con
cludes by Instructing the â¢ Prefect to re

TEL, WASHINGTON, Sept. 22.â Brigadier
General Fitzhugh LeÂ© Is uneasy about the
future of Cuba. In an interview here to
day he said: "The United States under
took the responsibility for the establish
ment of a stable form of government and
is pledged to the protection of British,
German, French and other foreign sub
jects residing and doing business In Cuba.
If the Cubans form an entirely Independ
ent government, rejecting all supervision
or control by the United States, and the
United States, acquiescing, withdraws
troops, relinquishing all authority, a ques
tion arises as to the guaranteed protection
of foreign interests.
"If any disorder should arise, and for
eign subjects should be injured and for
eign Interests suffer, all responsibility be
ing abandoned by the United States, the
power whose subjects were injured or
whose interests were threatened, would
undoubtedly send war vessels, perhaps
many of them to ports of Cuba to Insure
the protection which we no longer gave
and to compel reparation if injury had
been done. " .
"You understand what this would mean.
I don't know what this Government would
do if a government which rejects all con
nection with the United States Is or
ganized and the withdrawal of our troop3
demanded. It may be if there is a plain
Indication of disorder or Inability on the
part of the new government to preserve
order and protect foreigners that we will
retain troops on the island for the pur
pose of protection until tha stability of
the new government is assured."
As to the constitutional convention
General Lee said: "Everything in con

UNEASY AS TO
CUBA'S FUTURE
NEW YORK, Sept 22. - A Havana
dispatch to the Evening Post to-day says:
The lawyers who are defending Rathbone,
the former director of posts, now on bail,
have asked the authorities hers for the
Indictment and extradition of Fourth As
sistant Postmaster General Joseph L.
Bristow. He is charged with being tech
nically more culpable than Rathbone, b'e
cause he has permitted the payment of
the salaries of Mr. Rathbone's coachman,
footman and gardener out of the Cuban
treasury until the end of May, after ask
ing that Rathbone be prosecuted for this
offense. This Is taken here as a sign that
Rathbone will fight the administration to
the bitter end.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22.-Fourth As
sistant Postmaster General Bristow was
shown the Havana dispatch showing that
former Director General of Posts Rath
bone's attorneys had asked for his (Brls
tow's) indictment and extradition to Ha
vana. He laughed at the story and said
in view of the trouble It took to get a
man extradited to Cuba he dtd not feel
in any immediate danger. Regarding the
three private employes of Rathbone's
carried on the postoffice rolls, Mr. Bris
tow said:
"Those cases tyere taken up as soon as
I got to them. I investigated first the
Cuban postal service, then the Havana
office, and lastly Rathbone's Individual
accounts. These men were dropped from
the rolls at the end of Mayâ a few days
after I had gotten around to them otn
cially. One of the questions that will
have to be decided In the case of Rath
bone Is whether he must reimburse the
Government for the salaries of men while
they were In his private employ. I had
no right to pass on that, but I could de
cide that they were not needed In the Ha
vana office and I dropped them accord
ingly. As to the charge of payinng them
after I had asked for Rathbone's prose
cution. It Is only necessary to say that I
never asked for his prosecution until after
I had returned home and handed in my
report."

OBJECT 'OF GERMANY'S
LATEST MOVES IN CHINA
BERLIN, Sept. 22.â The Austrian Em
bassador here. Count von Szogeny Has
march, in an interview said:
"There is an erroneous impression in
the press about Count von Waldersee's
mission. A. number of important tasks
await him. Above all hÂ© must fore* China
to submit to the allied powers' peace con
ditions. Moral suasion. is entirely wasted
upon the Chinese Government, which, far
from being humiliated hitherto, still In
dulges in the hope of cheating the allies
out of the fruits of the victories by de
stroying the harmony among them. Von
Waldersee must arrange what military
demonstrations are required, what har
bors and inland towns must be occupied,
which points require expeditions and
which troops may retire from Peking. All
the powers are bound to this programme
by agreeing upon Von Waldersee as com
mander In chief, but each may reduce or
increase its contingent at will.
"Regarding the statement that Von
Waldersee will act as chief diplomatic
representative for the powersâ If It
ever was intendedâ has been abandoned,
it is possible the powers may Jointly ap
point one plenipotentiary for the settle
merit of their joint demands, viz., the safe
guarding of the foreign colonies and mis
sions tÂ© enable foreign merchants to
safely resume business everywhere in
China and also to rearrange the status of
the diplomatic corps. PonsibJy the "Chi
nese Government hereafter will be located
more Inland. Then the foreign diplomats
Â¦n^H. either be located at a treaty port,
perhaps Tientsin, or else they will need
large military protection.
"All of this von Waldersee must enforce
and also Germany's own special demands.
How each of the power's separate de
mands will be regulated and enforced is
a different matter. All the powers mean to
observe the motto. 'Ko further territorial
acquisitions,' but it will probably become
necessary for each power to occupy some
province or important point, of which the
taxes will be retained until each Is reim
bursed for its war outlay.

the Boxers movement Is not yet dead."

generally Lord Salisbury's confidants sur
mise guardedly that he will fall into line
with Germany, though he may suggest
slight znofiiacailon of the stringent condi
tions. Moreover It is believed that the
German note may prove a source of a
somewhat lengthy exchange of communi
citlcr.s before the consensus of the opin
ions of the powers Is ascertained and even
individual influence might be brought to
change their views In the interest of har
mony. Xo Inkling of the nature of Wash

it is now believed that if thÂ« European

a passive objector. ... , . ,~
A Foreign Ofnce official being asked If
beneath the maze of diplomatic intricacies
he taw any reason to believe that a ser
ious disagreement were probable, says:
"N'o- judging from the present condi
tions the negotiations ought to come out
a'l right. The powers of ina world have
been negotiating as they never did be
fore and have not yet begun to call each
ether names. This Oermaji proposal is
the first thing which has taken us the
slightest bit forward for a month., a:id
being eo it naturally calls out more di
versified'opinions. But even should the
majority of the powers reject it, which
seems improbable. I do not believe it
wou'd mean a breakup of the concert.
Russia may, and I believe will, withdraw
practically all her troops. We do not
share in the opinion of some sections of
the English press that this Is due to a
Ru'sso-Ciilnose bargain.
â¢It is merely the logical sequence to
tbe hard and fast policy laid down by the
Czar. But. while expecting this, we do
rot think It will cr.d the negotiations to
rut China on a proper basis. Russia. liKe
iv enoiigh, will take Manchuria. V% hat if
she does? Bhe cannot colonize it herself.
The experiments in Siberia proved that.
She can only establip'n a form of govern
ment which will insure the protection of
2-<r railroad and affiliated enterprises, it
would be the Chinese and colonists otner
than Rupsia who would benefit, bo, even
if Russia assumes control of Manchuria,
end withdraws her troops from the prov
ince of Chili, the latter action bemg fol
lowr-d by the United States, there Is no
reason to suppose that it would prevent
the powers from securing reparation for
the outrages and Installing a government
â¢which wiU open China to the wor^d ana
< nB ure its eventual civilization.
* The anti-Russian cable dispatches of Dr.
Morrison, the Peking correspondent of the
London Times, are viewed in Downing
street ae belr.s more the result of the se
vere strain of the siege and the heated
rivalry that must prevail where eo many
nationalities are quartered together, than
an impartial recording of facts.
Lior<i Huberts' laconic report that noth
ing Is left of the Boer army but a few
â¢â¢marauding bands," cams opportunely for
the Government. It was indeed an
r.ounced that Lord Salisbury avraited it
before â¢'going to the country. .laraud
ing hands do r.ot require the presence d
e. field marshal, so Lord Roberts' home
coming is eagerly awaited, though it would
teem that these same marauders will de
tain several army corps in South Africa.
But to all intents *md purposes, with the
exception of the casualty and Eick reports,
the war. eo far sls the British publlo Is
concerned, was ever weeks ago and the
doings of President Kruger are now fol
lowed with only half-hearted Interest.
mainly owing to the belief, apparently
well founded, that he will oe able to ac

Charles Yerkes* London railroad deal,
the purchase of the franchise of the
Charing Cross, Easton and Hampsted
Underground Railroad, creates consider
able interest. He la said to be paying
Â£103.000 for the right, which has yielded
the promoters a handsome profit. The
prppent plans of the syndicate involve the
expenditure of nearly Â£4.000,000. The fact
that all the capital is coming from Amer
ica and that the English are not asked to
subscribe creates astonishment, which
the Daily Telegraph well voices, saying:
"Further developments In connection
with electrical traction are talked of by
Mr. Terkes, but far the most Etart
ling development Is the change which
eueh events as the building of an under
ground road In London with American
capital proves to have taken place in the
economic conditions of the United States.
"Until the last few days Europe had to
supply a large part of the capital needed
for the development of American indus
tries.
"In 1S35 it was foreign capital that saved
her frees disaster. Now her capitalists
ire not only subscribing to English war
leans and exchequer bonfls and German
treasury bills, but an American eyndlcate
declares ltÂ« intention of spending several
millions in order to build a railroad In
London on which the best profit can be
but moderate."
The Times agrees with the Dally Tele
graph In earing Americans are a long
way ahead of England in electrical trac
tion, emphasizing the opinion by printing
en Its editorial page extracts from recent
reports from Lnited States Consul Hal
*.tÂ»Â»ad at Birmingham.
The American jockey* have been doing
pplendid work lately. How eplendid can
be Judged by the fact that a London dally
heads to-day's racing report, "The Ameri

reached the top of the jockey list, but fin
ished Just two wins behind Loates, close
ly followed by Little Johnny Reiff. At

SALISBURY HAS
N0T ANSWERED
NEW PROPOSAL
PARIS, Sept 22.â Under a tent covering
85,000 square meters 20,000 persons break
fasted as the guests of France In the
Tuillerles Gardens to-day. The banquet
was given by President Loubet to the
Mayors of the municipalities of France In
honor of the exposition. It can safely be
said that such a prodigious repast was
never before undertaken. The arrange
ments had been going forward for some
weeks and resulted In such excellence of
detail' that the event was carried to per
fection without a hitch. There was one
unpleasant Incident. Max Regis, the
anti-Semite Mayor of Algiers, tried to
secure a hearing, but his voice was
drowned by the shouts of the assem
blage. The police finally Intervened and
led Regis from the banquet, after some of
those present had thrown articles of food
at his head.
Long- before the hour for the feast to
begin a vast crowd began to assemble on
the Place de la Concorde, but such admir
able police precautions were taken that
the throng was handled without confu
sion. Tricolors, garlands of flowers and
masses of palms were to be seen on all
sides. In fact," the tent looked like a con
servatory. A band stationed In the tent
played patriotic airs, but the music was
scarcely audible on account of the din
occasioned by the clatter of dishes, knives
and forks. Just at noon President Loubet,
accompanied by the Cabinet Ministers,
arrived at the Place de la Concorde in
carriages. The crowd gave the party a
great ovation. Hats were thrown Into
the air, women waved handkerchiefs and
umbrellas and cheers for the President
and the republic were given heartily.
M. Loubet and the Ministers entered the
tent and ascended a raised platform, on
which was the table of honor and where
the dignitaries were seated./ The band
then played the 'â¢Marsellaise," and the
20,000 people arose and with their faces
turned toward the President loudly pro
claimed him. It was an Impressive sight
and was said to be the greatest ovation
that Loubet ever received.
When he had taken his seat the wonder
ful machinery of the service was set In
motion and the 21,870 domestics of various
descriptions began furnishing the fine
menu to almost the same number of
diners. For two hours the feast continued,
concluding at 2 o'clock. After M. Loubet
had delivered a short address congratulat
ing the country and the Mayors on their
harmony of purpose, he asked the Mayors
to carry back to their homes a report to
the effect that the republic "remains
steadfast to the principles of the Revolu
tion, because our patriotism equals our
love for the republic and because we wish
France to be free, strong, glorious and
united beneath the reign of law and Jus
tice and respected abroad for her genius
and power of her arms and her sincere
love for peace."
A series of fetes In honor of the Mayors
will be given.

the District Court In the Seventeenth Judicial District. This prominent Kansas
gentleman is a great believer in Peruna, the famous catarrh remedy, and writes
the following letter concerning It:
Topeka, Kas.
The Peruna Medicine Co., Columbus, Ohio:
Gentlemen â "As I am particularly liable to catch cold, which at
once settles in catarrh and seriously affects my hearing, I am indeed
pleased with the help. I have found since using Peruna. After a
severe attack a bottle never fails to restore me fully to health, and I
find that by using it occasionally it keeps me in good condition and
prevents me from catching cold. It is a fine tonic, and I accord it
my hearty endorsement."
Peruna cures catarrh wherever located.
As soon aa Peruna removes systemic
catarrh the digestion becomes good, ap-
petite regular, nerves strcng. and trouble
vanishes. Peruna strengthens weak
nerves^ not by temporarily stimulating
them, but by removing the cause of weak
nervesâ systemic catarrh. This is the
only cure that lasts. Remove the cause:
nature will do the rest. Peruna. removes
the cause. A
Mr. T. Sherman Bryan, writing to Lt
Hartman, says: "I have been using Pe-
runa for some time past and wish to tes-
tify as to lta great value In cases of
catarrh. My whole system was per-
meated with icatarrh for several years.
After using Peruna I find that I am great-
ly improved and cannot speak too highly
In praise of your great medicine. It has
given me a new lease of life."
Mr. T. Sherman Bryan is a cousin of
William Jennings Bryan, late candidate
for President and namesake of General

Attorney for the Southern District of

President Harrison, and also by President
McKinley. In a letter written from Vlck*-

pleased with the benefits derived from
Peruna, and have recommended It to s^L
my friends, both aa a tonic and catarjW

have seen It years ago Peruna would have
saved me much Inconvenience. I can

In systemic catarrh there Is more or

The catarrh may have originated in the
head or throat, tut It has finally pervad-
ed the whole system. It produces a

ALMENDABEZ TAKEN

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 22.â Gertrudes Al

Rodriguez at El Cajon, In this county,
has been captured after a long search
by rurales in Lower California and Is
now confined in the EnsCnada Jail await
ing the necessary requisition papers for
turning him over to the Sheriff of this
county.
The crime for which Almendarez will
soon have to stand trial in this county
was a cold-blooded killing. His victim,
with two other Mexicans, left El Cajcn
on the evening of September 16 last year
to attend a dance at the Martinez ranch,
near El Cajon. The party was overtaken
by Almendarez, who accused Rodriguez
of making too much noise by singing on
the road. The latter denied It, and of
fered Almendarez some tamales In a
friendly way, when the latter, according
to other witnesses, replied with an op
probrious name and thrust a , knife Into
his unsuspecting victim, killing him In
stantly. The murderer then rode rapidly
south and crossed the border Into Mexi
can territory. His arrest was recently
made on the order of the Governor of
Lower California.

Not Molested.
Safe Is Robbed, but Passengers Are
LINCOLX, Neb., Sept. 22.â Four masked
men held up the express car on the St.
Louis-Portland train of the Burlington
road early to-day at the village of Wood
lawn, a few miles northwest of Lincoln.
The men commanded the express messen
ger to open the local safe for them. The
through safe, which the messenger" could
not open and which contained a large sum
of money, was not molested. The robbers
secured a very large sum from the local
safe. After going through the safe the
men left the express car and disappeared.
The train left Lincoln shortly after mid
night and it is supposed the robbers
boarded it at this place.
A young man who came In to-day from
the scene said that the engineer was
struck on the head with a revolver and
that the pockets of the passengers were
rifled. The railroad authorities say no
money was secured except from the local
safe. They admit the engineer and fire
men were covered with revolvers and
were compelled to stop the train, but say
neither waa hurt. The fourth robber
crept over the tender to reach the en
glnemen. The fireman was ordered to
detach the express car from the remain
der of the train, but this he was unable
to do. The Burlington Company has of
fered a reward of $500 each for the appre
hension of the robbers.

Special Dispatch to The CaSL
SAN DIEGO, Sept! 22.â The close oi tho
first week of school finds seven of the
boys of the local high school sentenced to
suffer the most severÂ© punishment that
has been Inflicted In ihls city In many
years. They are denied the privileges of
the playground for six months and de
tained after school one hour each day for
thirty days. The punishment Is for "tax
ing," or for "canning," as the high school
boys call it On thÂ© second day of school
eight or ten of the boys who had been at
tending for a year or two and who there
fore thought that they had the better
right to the privileges of the school
ground, determined to "haze," or "con."
one of the new comers.
One victim was Frank Jennings, iÂ» son
of Deputy Sheriff Jennings, and ht~: re
sistance caused almost the entire Koala
membership of the upper classes to l*;gln
an attack upon him. Ho was throwrjinto
a pit in the school yard, which had peen
given the name of the "can." Thisjwas
nothing more than a hole in the grbund
Into which the refuse papers and sweep
ings from the school were thrown \ and
burned. It happened that on the morning
before Jennings was captured a match
had been touched 'to the paper and rub
bish and the bottom of the pit vis a
mass of live coals. Into this bed of <oala
young Jennings landed on his hands and
head. Fortunately his eyes were protect
ed and his face escaped, but his hands
were burned to such an extent that it will
be months before he can use one of them
and he may be compelled to carry about
with him a drawn and withered hand for
the rest of his life.
There were others besides Jennlnps who
were Injured and the threats of criminal
prosecution were frequent, but the affair
was finally passed up to the school offi
cers. Principal Haliday Is charged with
finding out all who were engaged in the
disgraceful affair and to see that they are
numbered among those who are to be
punished. Those who have confessed to
having played a part are James Love,
Alvin L*e. Loy Enscho, ' Marks Moss
holder. George Hodge, Caspar Thompson
and Chauncey Wheeler.
The Board of Education is determined to
break up the practice this year If it has
to resort to expulsion from school. Last
year one of the boys who was hazed had
an arm broken In this same "canning"
operation, but the knowledge of it did not
reach the Board of Education until
months afterward. Â¦ Â»
GREEX RIVER. TTyo., Sept. 22.â
The Roosevelt train on its Jour
ney hither to-day stopped at
Evanston and Green River. At
each place the Governor made
brief epeecnes. At Evanston Mr. Roose
velt Bald:
Four years ago It was exceedingly 'difficult
for a man to eet work; now there is work In
abundance and an ample supply for alii so that
the condition of the v. ageworkers. and espe
cially of the business man. the farmer and the
merchant, is immensely improved. All over the
country you see Improvement. I ask you to
look back to the prophecies made by our oppo
nents fcur years ago. Again and again they
paid that If McKinley were elected the wage
worker would stand Idle half the time; that It
McKlnley were elected the farmer would see
the price of the goods he sold fail Bteadlly
lower: that there would be in the case of Mc-
Klnle3''s election a tremendous diminution In
the deposits in the savings banks and an in
crease in the failures among business men.
Now there has not been a single prophecy
Â¦which they made that has not been absolutely
falsified by the event. In your votes this fall
you should not Indorse the men who have tried
to deceive you with false prophecies, but rather
indorse those whose promises have been kept.
At Green River to-day Governor Roose
velt said:
Under the administration of President Mc-
Klnley tli*re h-ivo been ivMt w<Â« call i:ccd
times. I want you to cirars.re the conditions
us they existed six cvr eight years aÂ«c with

was one of the cries during- the Cleveland ad
ministration. Compare the price of wool then
with what it is now. I-*t every trainman or
man who works in the shops compare four
years a&o with the present time. Then it waa
not easy to get work: now any man who wants
to Â¦wvrk can Â«ret It.
You must decide for yourselves whether you
want the present conditions to continue or
whether you want to take the chances on gro

whether cr not she wants to ko back to them

As we came up the street to this building:,
along the way I eaw the children waving

that only ine man was in the plot. Con
ductor DunrAr.g was the only one on the '
train Â¦who offered any resistance, and a
few phots from the robber's revolver ef
fectually silenced the trainman.
As the bandit stepped off the train at
Rathdrum the conductor came out of the
tourist oar and fired twice at him. The
fellow returned the fire, clipping a piece
of leather from the conductor's ehoe. No
one was hurt during the hold-up, but ev

FINAL CALL TO DEMOCRATS.
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.-The final call for
tho National Convention of Democratic
Clube, to be held in Indianapolis, Octo
ber 8, was Issued to-day, as follows:
"The Democratic dubs,, societies and
citizens of the United States: The near
approach of tho National Convention of
Democratic Clubs, which will be held at
Indianapolis on October 3, imposed on
Democrats everywhere the duty of in
creasing the work of club organization.
This la a field of patriotic endeavor In
which every citizen of every State and
Territory can be reasonably expected to
take his place. Patriotism can accomplish
little unless It is practical. The far reach-
Ing issues which confront the American
people to-dayâ Issues which involve our
form of government and the principles
upon which rt has thus far securely rested
â should Impel every citizen to become a
politician in his own right. The Govern
ment belongs to tho people and the peo
ple themselves must defend it when ft is
in danger.
"The Democratic party Is opposed to
the establishment of independent colonies
under the American flag, and is pledged
to unceasing . warfare against trusts in
every form of private monopoly. The
Kansas City platform has arrayed against
the Democracy the combined power of
those who profit by iniquitous laws, Gov
ernment favoritism and perversions of
the constitution of the United States.
â¢"A vast corruption fund has been con
tributed to the Republican party by those
whose personal greed is greater than their
Interest in free institutions, Just legisla
tion and impartial administration of the
law. Unless the control of the Govern
ment and Its policies are to be determined
by tho corupt use of money the people
must be awakened to a realizing senso
of tho deadly peril environing their most
eaered democratic Institutions.
"The Democratic partv relies tor vic
tory upon tho justice of Its cause and
the hearty co-operation of its supporters.
The work of defending the nation against
Imperialism, militarism and trusts can
be best advanced by club organization.
It Is a convenient and inexpensive method
of raising a great volunteer army of lib
erty. A loyal citizen thould be ready to
serve his country in times of peace aa
well as In times of war.
"Let every citizen who sympathizes
the greater part of his speech to the lat
ter subject.
From here Mr. Shortridgo will go Mon
day to San Bernardino.

The popular idea expressed 'In the

the opirion that the chief er-mies a man
has to defend himself froii are visible

every mÂ»" is from minute and often in-
visible foes. In the air we breatho and
the water we drink are countless minute
organisms leagued against tha health of
the body. ,
The one defense against these enemies
is to keep the blood pure. Dr. Pierce's
Golden Sledical Discovery thoroughly
purifies the blood, removing poisonous
substances and accretions. When the
blood is pure there is no harborage for
the trermfl of disease which find a lodg-

DISASTROUS DAY
FOR THE TALENT
AT GRAVESEND
Judge Miller, counsel for Dr. Martin
<lale, pay? that the shooting Is only an
incident intended as a starter for ah at
tempt at blackmail. He says he has long
known Dr. and Mrs. Murtimlal* at Min
neapolis and both are highly connected.
Kotlaba was immeditely arrested by Of
flcera Walker ami Rosso and booked at
the City Prison for assault with a deadly
weapon.
Dr. Martindale, who so narrowly es
caped the bullets of Kotlaba. denies the
charge that is made by the frenzied hus
band. He says that he declined to ad
minister an anaesthetic and perform an
operation upon Mrs. Kotlaba unless shu
would come attended by i some femaiÂ«
friend. He denies that he took any liber
ties with Mrs. Kotlaba or gave to her
husoand any other provocation 'lor the
attempt to kill him. He says he was a
practicing physician fifteen years in Min
neapolis before he came to Los Angoles
He has been married thirteen years and
has two sons. Ho expresses confidence in
being able to disprove Kotlaba'a accusa
tion and has regained a law firm to look
after his interests. .
Kotlaba says that he was driven to this
attempt to kill the doctor by most ag
gravating provocation. He asserts that
his wife had gone to Dr. Martindale to
have a surgical operation performed and
that while she was under the influence
of chloroform the doctor took advantage
of her condition. With this as a motive
for revenge Kotlaba sought the doctor
and when within range opened fire upon
him. He was greatly excited and to this
fact Is attributed the poor marksmanship
that saved his intended victim from per
foration.
,LrOS ANGELES. Sept. 22.â Frank G.
Kotlaba. /whose home is at 314 South
Workman street, fired five shots at Dr.
J. H. Martindale at 10:30 o'clock this
morning. Every shut missed, though the
firing was at short range' in the doctor's
office at the Bellevue Terrace Hotel on
Figueroa street. Kotlaba was much in
earnest despite his poor marksmanship.
The weapon he used was a 32-caliber re
volver.

SANTA ROSA, Sept. 22.â The climax of
the trial of Dr. S. S. Bogle for the mur
der of J. M. Miller was reached this after
noon when the defendant took the stand
to testify in his own behalf. During all
the months that have intervened since the
tragedy he has f-aid no word in expla
nation of his crime, and as a consequence
there was quite a flutter in the courtroom
whf-n Dr. Bogle's name was called and he
walked up to the witness stand. The first
part of his testimony related to the
trouble ho had with Miller in regard to a
disputed bill. When the witness reached
thst portion of his testimony relating to
th<- firing of the shots not a sound broke
the stillness of the courtroom, which was
crowded to .suffocation. Said he:
A few minutes before 7 o'eftx-k I walked down
the front Ff-ps at my reeidenre. As I reached
tl.Â« sidewalk 1 heard a ccreen door open and
oir.Ff-. A moment latPr I saw Millar on the

ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS.
Will Always Be Ready to Protect
American Interests in China.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22.â President Mc-
Kinley has given unmistakable notifica
tion to the world of his purpose to be pre
pared to protect by force American in
terests 'In China. Simultaneously with
the publication of the correspondence de
scribing the independent attitude adopted
by the United States Secretary Long
handed to the President a statement to
the effect that in view of the possibility
that later, when circumstances so war
rant, the land force in China will be ma
terially reduced the naval force In
Asiatic waters will be from time to time
increased with reference to American in
terests in China and also in the Philip
pines. There Is no doubt that this aug
mentation of the Asiatic station is due
to friction among the powers and the de
sire of the administration to be prepared
for eventualities.
This Government has watched with
some apprehension the increase which
European nations have made in their re
spective squadrons, but the need of adding
to the American fleet did not seem neces
sary while the powers were acting in har
mony. Germany's action in throwing ob
stacles In the way of the restoration of
peace and of her dispatch of four battle
ships and 60,000 men to the East has
deeply impressed the President and mem
bers of the Cabinet. .
There is no intention on the part of this
Government to become embroiled in in
ternational trouble if it can be avoided,
but it is deemed advisable to be prepared
for developments, and It is believed that
the nations of Europe which desire terri
tory in China will be the more anxious to
live up to their declarations in favor of
the maintenance of the empire's integrity
if a formidable American fleet be close at
hand to prevent injury to American inter
ests. By direction of Secretary Long, the
board more "than two months ago gave
consideration to a naval programme to be
adopted by the United States should an
international conflict be precipitated.
The smaller craft ordered to China sta
tion, such as the Dorothea, "Wilmington,
Annapolis and Vicksburg, will be especi
ally valuable for use in the waters of the
Philippines and China, but the Kentucky
and Albany are sent not because it is de
sired to impress the Filipinos or the Chi
nese who are ready and anxious to treat
for peace, but for the moral effect upon
Europe. There had been some talk of
the return of the battleship Oregon, bat it
can be safely stated she will remain in
China until the trouble there Is at an
end or she is replaced by some other ves
sel. It is proposed that vessels under or
ders to report to Admiral Kemey shall
proceed as rapidly as possible.
The Albany will start immediately from
Greece and the Wilmington from Pal
myra, South America. The Kentucky has
been ordered to New York and the
Vicksburg to Boston. The Kentucky is
a new battleship, equipped with superim
posed turrets. She will therefore not re
quire repair?, but will need docking and
and supplies for her long cruise. The
Vicksburg will be fitted at Boston, the
Dorothea at League Island and the Ann
apolis at Boston. These three last named
ships are not in commission.
Upon the arrival of the six vessels or
dered to join Admiral Remey and that of
the colliers conveying coal to his com- |
mand this fleet of the United States will |
comprise two battleships, one gunboat,
two auxiliary cruisers, five colliers and
three supply ships.
In the event of war, however, the first
move that would be made would be to
effect a junction between the Asiatic and
Facitic squadrons. The Pacific squadron
comprises the battleship Iowa, cruiser
Philadelphia, auxiliary cruiser Abarenda
and gunboats Ranger and Wheeling. The
battleship Wisconsin will be placed in
commission next month. There are five
torpedo-boats available. The United States
lias therefore in the Pacific an effective
fighting force of four battleships, one ar- i
mored cruiser, two monitors, four pro
tected cruisers, eighteen gunboats and
five torpedo-boats, besides auxiliary cruis
ers and colliers. Foreign naval attaches
here consider this a formidable fleet.
CAPTURE OF PEITAITG FORTS
Reports Concerning the Latest Vic
tory of the Allies.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22.â The Navy
Department has received the following
cablegram from Admiral Remey:
"TAKU, Sept. 21.â Secretary of Navy,
Â¦Washington: Force of Russians, Ger
mans and Austrians advanced on Peltan?
forts last night. Fire opened by Chinese
and kept up all night at intervals. Forts
evacuated at 9 this morning. Europeans
hoisted their colors over forts at 11.
Twenty-five Russians and Germans re
ported blown up by mine. Information
from. Commander "Wise, who followed the
troops into the forts, says only five Chi
nese killed."
BERLIN. Sept. 22. â A dispatch received
here from Tientsin gives the losses of the
allies at the capture of the Peitang forts
as 120 men. including seven Germans. The
Chinese, the dispatch adds, escaped in
boats.
TAKU. Sept. 20.â Four thousand Rus
sians, 3000 Germans and 10W French
troops, with a detachment of Austrian
marines, began the attack upon the Pel
tang forts at daylight. The attack was
answered briskly from the forts, the bom
bardment continuing until noon, but it
was noticed that the forts did not reply
after 10 o'clock. The allies sent for
ward at noon to discover the reason of
the cessation of firing from the forts
found them deserted, there being only
four dead. Chinamen within the walls.
The allies were much chagrined, as they
believed they had the place completely
surrounded, making escape impossible;
vet over 3000 men got away In broad day
light. The Russian artillery fire had
proved effective and the forts were badly
damaged. The British and Italian com
manders had decided to join in the at
tack, but their troops had not arrived In
time.
The entire line between Tientsin and
Taku shows reinforcements were heading
for the forts. Three members of the allied
forces were killed and fifty were wounded
through the explosion of mines laid along
their line of march.

TIENTSIN (via Taku), Sept. 22.â The Emperor and the court are at Takung-Fu, in the
north of Shansi province. General Chaffee considers that his work was ended at the relief of Pe
king, and he refused to take the imperiarpa lace > where the E m P ress Dowager and her Ministers
plotted the destruction to the foreigners and. Christians while they listened to the bombardment of
the legations. There are reliable reports that the group of large temples fourteen miles west of
Peking is full of Boxers who escaped from Peking after kiHing.knd burning for two months. Many
notorious leaders are there. They are defiant and have plenty of munitions and are raiding vil
lages. The American general refused co-operation with the British to punish these cutthroats,
and General Chaffee's attitude is condemned by all who favor permanent peace.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22.â The
State Department to-night
made public the text of the
'notes addressed by It to the
governments of Germany, Rus
sia and China in answer to Inquiries from
thorn as to the attitude of. the United
States toward various phases of the Chi
nese problem. The forecasts of these
notes made In the press appear to have
l>een accurate, for although nowhere In
the text is reference made to the with
drawal of United States troops from
China the official statement issued by the
Navy Department in advance of the pub
lication of the notes bears out the predic
tion that the Government finally has de
cided upon such a material reduction of
its military force as will amount to a
withdrawal of the army as an offensive
instrument. This statement from the
Navy Department, moreover, is full of
significance of a purpose on the part of j
the Government to see to it that If there J
is any subsequent attempt at territorial |
aggression on the part of any of the pow- j
ers who already have declared themselves j
as willing to abide by the expressed de
termination of the United States to re
frain from seizing 1 upon Chinese territory,
then the United States is to lose no right
or privilege which it now enjoys by such
action. The notes themselves are brief,
considering the importance of the topics
treated. The Russian and Chinese an
swers, being in the form of diplomatic
memoranda, are short to a degree rarely
seen in diplomatic exchanges. But in
both cases, being completely responsive
and fa%-orablo to the inquiry, they will es
cape criticism on that score.
The answer to the German note is care
fully phrased, so as to soften the unquali
fied refusal of the United States Govern
ment to make the punishment of the Chi
nese ringleaders a condition precedent to
negotiations. Also it Is noted that in the
expression of a purpose to insist upon the
ultimate and proper punishment of these
offenders the State Department goes far
beyond the German declaration on the
subject. The announcement that the de
partment intends immediately to begin,
through Mr. Conger, conferences with
Chins and L.i Hung Chang, although dis
tinctly marking the fact that these are
only preliminary to final negotiations,
will have- the effect to force the other
powers to an immediate determination of
their policies In this matter. The text of
the correspondence follows:
Chinese correspondence, September IS
and 21, 1900.
Proposal of the German Government in
regard to the delivery of the responsible
authors of recent crimes committed in
Peking and^the reply of the United States
thereto:
(The Imperial German Charge d'Affaires
to the Secretary of State. Translation.)
Imperial German Embassy, Washington D.
C, Sept. 18, 1900. â Mr. Secretary: By direc
tion or the Imperial Chancellor, I have the
honor to respectfully communicate to your
Excellency the following: The Government of
his Majesty, the Emperor, considers as a pre
liminary condition for entering into diplomatic
negotiations with the Chinese Government a
surrender of such persons as are determined
upon as being the first and real perpetrators
of the crimes committed in Peking against In
ternational law. The number of perpetrators)
who served as tools is too great, a wholesale
execution would be averse to the civilized
conscience. Furthermore, circumstances would
not allow that even If the group of leaders
could be completely ascertained. But the few
among them whose guilt is notorious should
be surrendered and punished.
The representatives of the powers in Peking
will be In a position to make or adduce In
this investigation fully valid testimony. The
number of those punished is of less Importance
than their capture us principal instigators and
leaders. The Government of his Majesty, the
Emperor, believes that It can depend in this
matter upon the concurrence of all the Cabi
nets; for indifference toward the idea of a
Juet expiation would be equivalent' to indiffer
ence toward a repetition of the crime.
The Government of his Majesty, the Em
peror, therefore proposes to the Interested Cab
inets that they request their representatives in
Peking to designate the principal Chinese per
sonages whose guilt In the instigation or exe
cution of crimes in beyond doubt.
A similar communication is forwarded to the
other Interested Cabinets. STERNBL'UG.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 21, 1900.
Sir: In response to your inquiry of the 18th
as tÂ» the attitude of the Government of the*
United States In regard to exemplary punish
ment of the notable leaders in the crimes com
mitted in Peking against international law, I
have the honor to nfake the following state
ment:
The Government of the United States has
from the -outset proclaimed its purpose to hold
to the uttermost accountability the responsible
authors of any wrongs done In China to citizens
of the United States and their interests, as was
stated in the Government circular communica
tion of July 3 last. These wrongs have been
I committed not alone in Peking, but In many
other parts of the empire, and their punishment
is believed to be an essential element of any
effective settlement which shall prevent a re
currence of such outrages and bring about peace
In China. It Is thought, however, that no puni
tive measures can be bo effective by way of
I rer.aration for wrongs suffered and as deterrent
examples for the. future as the degradation and
punishment of the responsible authors by the
supreme imperial authority itself, and it seems
only just to China that ehe should lxÂ» afforded
In the flrÂ»t instance an opportunity to do this
and thus rehabilitate herself before the world.
Believing thusly, and without abating In any
wise its deliberate purpose to exact the fullest
accountability from the responsible authors of
the wrongs we have suffered In China, the Gov
ernment of the United States is not disposed
aa.a preliminary condition to entering . into
diplomatic negotiations with the Chinese Gov
ernment, to Join In a demand that said Gov
ernment surrender to the powers such persons
as. according to the determination of the pow
ers themselves, may be held to be the first and
real perpetrators of those wrongs. On the other
hand this Government is disposed to hold that
the punishment of the high responsible authors
of the wrongs, not only In Peking, but through-*
out China, Is essentially a condition to be em
braced and provided for in the negotiations for
a final settlement. It is the purpose of this
Government, at the earliest practicable mo
ment, to name its plenipotentiaries for nego
tiating a settlement with China and in the
meantime to authorize its Minister In Peking
to enter forthwith Its conference with- the duly
authorized representatives of the Chinese Gov
j einment, with a view to bringing about a pre
liminary agreement whereby the full exercise of
the Imperial power for the preservation of or
der and the protection of foreign life and prop
erty throughout China, pending negotiations
Â¦ with the powers, shall be assured.

LOS AXGELES, Sept. 22.â At the Meth
odlst conference this morning Rev. J. W.
Shenk. formerly of Omaha, but now of
Los Angeles, volunteered to raise $30,000
to endow a chair in the University of
Southern California^ The proposition waa
greeted with chwrs, and when they had
subsided the Bishop made a speech. In
which he said that the gentleman was re
sponsible and could be depended upon to
raise the money if he promised to do so.
When asked regarding hia plans, for
raising the sum. Rev. Mr. Shenk said they
were to be kept secret for the present.
It would take three years to raise the
money, which should come through the
natural resources of California.
The report on church taxation by a
committee appointed to draft resolutions
was read. The report opens as follows: j
Our lnvestlURtion leads us to believe that
unless the enormous and unrighteous burd>n of
taxation upon our churches shall be removed,
they must Rive up the Ftruggle. to build and
maintain houees of worship worthy of the. ad
vancing civilization of our State.,
Secondâ That there Is singular apathy upon
this subject, even among Christian men. and
that this amendment will certainly be lost ur.-
IeÂ»s every honorable means be used to awaken
righteous sentiment.
It further states that every piece of
legislation requires a certain amount of
money to be expended in getting the In
formation before the people, and asks
that October 7 be set apart as a day in
which to raise money in the churches for
this purpose. The preachers are to make
a canvass of their congregations and do
their best to get the Issue before the peo
ple. - '

The fight is not one-sided by any means. The Lib
erals mock at the opposition to the preferential tariff
and quote Conservative statesmen in favor of that
policy in times past. They also charge Sir Charles
Tupper, the Conservative leader, with putting up more
jobs than Laurier has ever been accused of. It is said
that there are thirty-three of the Tupper family draw
ing salaries from the public treasury, while Laurier
has not a single relative in office. One earnest Lib
eral goes so far in the way of campaign argument a3
to say: "In 1896 there were eleven convicts in King
ston penitentiary, ten of whom were Conservatives.
The eleventh", the Liberal, escaped. He said he
didn't mind being in jail so much, but he objected to
the company."
From the reports that come to us it appears there
is to be no paramount issue in the campaign.
Laurier's administration is to be assailed all along
the line. The Conservative leaders are already on. the
stump and are greeted with a good deal of enthusiasm
The charges are not made in a vague way. Tims
the Montreal Gazette recently said: "Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, in 1896, promised Canada a business Govern
ment. He gave a Government that paid $3,000,000
mere for the construction of the Crow's Nest railway
than the company had offered to do the work for; a
Government that conceived the Yukon railway deal,
that brought about the imposition of discriminating
duties on Canadian grain in Germany, that burked
the fast Atlantic mail service arrangement and gave
the country the present ten-day voyage service, that
drew out the 'business is business' letter as a'code of
political morals, and inflicted on the country *he
shame of the emergency rations scandal. It is time
to turn the humbugs down."
All kinds of charges are made against the Ministry.
It is said that by his preferential tariff in favor of Brit
ish goods Laurier has sacrificed the interests of Can
ada; that he promised to reduce taxes, but instead
has added to the taxes, to the expenditures and to
the public debt; that his .Government has been marked
by many corrupt deals and jobs; and, finally, "that his
supporters are trying to arouse race prejudices in
Quebec by asserting that the Conservative opposition
to him is due solely to the fact that he is of French
descent
CANADA is making ready for a general election,
and it promises to be a hot one. There is no
complaint of apathy on either side. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier is to ask of the voters an approval of his ad
ministration and a new lease of power ; but if the
Conservatives , are to be trusted the request will be
treated as a bit of impudence deserving of a rebuke
at the polls that will be memorable forever.
HOT TIMES IN CANADA.
Under the terms of the new lease, which has been
approved by the city officials, the State is to take the
outside portion of the company's seawall for a dis
tance of 100 feet after it has completed its own sea
wall from Mission street to China Basin, a distance of
6000 feet. The net result will be that the Valley road,
by getting one-half of the seawall, gets five acres more
than by the old lease. As an offset the State will not
have to build 2300 feet south of the basin, at a cost of
$250,000.
It can hardly be doubted that the public will ap
prove the action of the city officials in the matter.
The interests of the city and the State appear to be
carefully guarded at every point. It is of course
recognized that an early settlement of the issue will
be of great advantage to all concerned. China Basin
is now unprofitable property. The improvement of
it in the manner purposed by the Santa Fe road
would in itself be no small compensation for the privi
leges the road asks for. With the revival of trade
sure to follow the settlement of the disturbances in
China and the extension of commercial privileges in
that empire there will be urgent need in California
and in San Francisco of a terminal in this city for
the competing transcontinental road, and accordingly
whatever will hasten the completion of the China 1
Basin improvements on fair firms should be sup
ported by the State as well as the city officials.^
' ZZJ VERY interest of the city and the State will be
advanced by an early settlement of all points
* in dispute concerning the proposed lease of
China Basin to the Santa Fe Pailroad. For years
past the commercial and industrial advancement of
California has been retarded by the lack of better
transportation facilities across the continent, and more
dock room in San Francisco. The lease of China
Basin to a transcontinental railway company for the
establishment of a terminal in this city, under the
terms proposed, will supply both those needs. It will
furnish a competitive transpertation route and bring
about an extension of the seawall, which will mate
rially increase the advantages of the' port.

PERSONAL MENTION.
From Petaluma and from San Rafael came reports
of fires starting in the neighborhood of Novato and
spYeading rapidly with the wind. According to one
report: "It is said fifteen square miles of country has
already been desolated by the fire. Thousands of
dollars probably will be lost in timber alone, as the
Novato Land Company's ranch is covered by a thick
growth of oak trees." Reports from Benicia told of
several fires in the pastures to the north and the west
of that town, and added: "Dense volumes of smoke
from the fire are still plainly visible in the direction of
Woodland dispatches announced: "During the
high wind yesterday a fire swept over a <arge area be
tween Dunnigan and Blacks." Santa Cruz reports
*2.id: "A brush and forest fire has raged yesterday
and to-day near Ben Lomond. The damage done was
the burning of a barn and its contents, acres of pas
turag-, much cordwood belonging to woodchoppers
and miles of fencing." Sacramento sent the news:
"Early this morning a fire started on the Olson
ranch, about twelve miles east of the city, and at last
accounts it was sweeping over the stubble fields be
fore a stiff northwest wind." A San Bernardino dis
patch said: "A destructive fire is raging on the for
est reservation north of this city. Thousands of
acres have been burned over, Teaching from Hous
tor.s Flat to Strawberry Peak, a distance of over live
rr.iles. The flames are now being fanned by a high
north wind."
That is the record of one day. It will be noted that
in many instanciÂ»*he reports announce that the fires
were still raging at the time the dispatches were sent
No estimate can be made of the total amount of the
damage, but it will surely amount in the aggregate
to a very large sum. Certainly the fires have im
posed a heavy tax upon the communities over which
they swept, and it is therefore pertinent to inquire
whether it would not be better to bear a slight tax
to prevent fires than to pay so dearly for tolerating
conditions which produce them and permit their
\ Â» c ere about to elect a Legislature, which will as
fc:rible this year. Why not require of every candi
date for a legislative office a pledge that he will ad
vocate, support and urge the enactment at the com
:::;? session of some well devised measure for pro
tecting our forests and our fields from the annual
ravage of the fires of the dry season?
BURKING WOODS AND FIELDS.
rAS i and furious cosne the lessons by which the
people of California are being instructed upon
the need of establishing some comprehensive
system of icrest protection. The dry, warm winds
that have swept over the State during the last few
days have made the grass of the pastures and the un
derbrush of the woods almost as inflammable as so
much tinder, and as a result the number of fires in
various parts of the State and the extent of the dam
age constitute a salient feature of the nevÂ»-s of the day.
The reports published in The Call yesterday show
mere or less extensive fires in nearly all parts of the
Stale. From Oakland came accounts of fires sweep
ing from Contra Costa County toward Berkeley,
closing with the statement: "In sight of Berkeley
over 2000 acres of land was burned over. It is esti
mated the fire swepf over at least 20,000 acres before
reaching the Berkeley side of the Contra Costa hills."
Stockton dispatches, describing a fire near Clements,
6-id: "The whole country around Clements looks
desolate and black. All the pasture and much grain
and hay have been burned. The loss probably will
reach well into the thousands. The path of the flames
was on an average four miles broad."
The board of governors selected is a most excellent
one. None can doubt the success of an en
terprise in the hands of such men as have accepted
charge of the museum. The first point of importance
is to find a man to take executive management of the
enterprise who will be equal to the task and the re
sponsibilities of the office. If the right man be found,
the Pacific Commercial Museum will soon have a
repute not inferior to that of the great institution at
Philadelphia.
The museum in this city has before it a field of work
peculiar to itself, and yet one of so broad a nature
that it comprehends the whole commercial activity of
the Pacific Ocean, including in that activity all the
exchanges that are to go on between this continent
and the new civilizations of Australa'sia and the old
civilizations of the Orient. What the museum will
be able to do for particular lines of trade is as yet
merely a matter of speculation, but as soon as the
work begins the results to each class of business men
will make themselves known. Every person engaged
in the trade of the Pacific will then sec what the
museum can do for him and will give it support ac
cordingly.
The history of the Commercial Museum in Phila
delphia is full of encouragement for the promoters of
the enterprise here. When that institution was be
gun not even its most sanguine supporters had any
conception of the rapidity with which its field of labor
would expand and its usefulness to the commercial
world increase. It was originally designed as some
thing of a local enterprise. It ha3 become even more
than a national enterprise. It is of use to merchants
of all lands, and its influence is felt to a greater or
less extent in every commercial center of the globe.
BY the election of a board of governors at the
meeting on Friday the Pacific Comrnercial
Museum becomes a fully organized association
and isâ now prepared to begin its work. It starts
under good auspices. It has already an assured mem
bership sufficient to establish it, and the. revenues
will be ample to maintain it on a scale large enough
to demonstrate its usefulness to the community. That
is all required at this time, for as soon as its utility
value has been proven by actual service it will have
no need to advertise for members nor beg for money.

In "Cinna" tha theme â the clemency of

"Henry V"â the shamblesâ ambition of the
Kingâ is ignoble, while in the strong
scenes of "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,"
to use Fielding's phrase, the comic char
acters are shown (not as in "Henry V")
by low Jests, but by actions of their own.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The more one contemplates the
mass of werld-drama that Mr. Mansfield
has to draw from the more is one amazed
at his investing a fortune in such a play

had vision apocalyptic of this production
when he wrote these (slightly amended)
lines:
The play stands still: hang- action and dis-
Such detestable passages as that quoted
aboveâ and they occur too often in the
Elizabethan dramaâ make one almost
sympathize with Voltaire when he called
Shakespeare an Intoxicated barbarian and
make one smile when the English wax
eloquent over the alleged "immorality"
of the French stage. There is nothing
in Cornellle and Moliere combinedâ the
only way of saying Shakespearean French
âas bad in subject and in treatment as
is "Henry V." If Mr. Mansfield wants
to do something at once unusual, classic
and educativeâ and' he is credited with
having high idealsâ why not try, in trans
lation, a masterpiece â say "Cinna." or "Le
Bourgeois Gentilhomme" â by one of these
great writers? It would not cost one
tenth of $30,000; it could get along with
little armor, less paint and no tinsel; It
would, moreover, have the charm of ab-
BOlute novelty for his audiences.
Will Mr. Mansfield feel proud of himsell
as he spouts or causes to be spouted these
and yards of similar lines that .Shake
speare has put Into "Henry V"? Does he
think that" $30,000 spent on tinsel, armor
and paint can reconcile us to this kind of
clotted nonsense? Or has the success of
"Ben Hur" convinced him that if only you
make the theater exactly like a clrcu3

the end, object and aim of the drama is to

MORE than one of the September j
magazines have articles on the
Ober-Ammergau passion play:
by far the best is that of H. D.
Rawnsley in the Atlantic. Three things
impressed him as, especially noteworthy in
this year's performance: first, the ar
rangement of the tableaux, wherein some
times as many as six hundred persons
(one-third of them children) were on the
stage, yet the effect was that of absolute
rest; second, the art displayed in the
management of stage crowds; third, the
naturalness and dignity characterizing
the action of the principal performers
explainable by their entire absorption in
their work, and by their actually living,
for the time, the personages they repre
sented.
lutely unjustifiable and was In itself a
direct violation of those principles of
self-government which Englishmen had
prided themselves on ever since the days
of the great charter. For the "hero" of
this war the poet strains every nerve to
enlist the sympathy of his audience; with
rude Elizabethans, to whom cock fighting
and bear baiting still afforded exquisite
pleasure, ho may have succeeded; but I
cannot imagine a modern audience â can
you?â feeling anything but disgust for the
"hero" who thus summoned to surrender

Richard Mansfield is going to spend
$30,000 in producing "Henry V," another
tribute paid to medievalism that one
would think hardly possible on the eve of
the twentieth century. "Henry- V" Is a
play which Shakespeare, as Mr. Shaw has
well said, ought to have been ashamed of
himself for writingâ a glorification of tha
braggadocio spirit of. one of the worst
Kings that ever sat on tha English
throne, an appeal to the worst passions
of the Ignorant and vindictive mob. The
horrible war that Henry V declared and
pitilessly waged against France was abso-

cieuse." He describes her awakening, her
toilet, her receiving of friends (La Ruelle)
and their inane rondeaux, her visit

In the most precious style of preciosity.
Strango that this silliest of literary fads
should interest anybody to-day in the
land of that Moliere who made preciosity
forever ridiculous! This poem Is another
indication of the backward-looking cast
of M. Rostand's mind; nothing modern in
terests him and therefore as a modern he
cannot live. He is now at work on a
new play for Sarah Bernhardt; subject
most novel and strikingâ "Persecution of
the Christians by Nero." Apropos of this
the Critic's Lounger pertinently asks. Are
M. Rostand and Mme. Bernhardt the only
persons who have never heard of Quo

in the West and it is to be hoped it never
will.
Augustus Thomas' "Arizona" has been
at last produced in New York and has
scored a success. That is good news for
the American playwright; it may not be
long before even the syndicate discovers
that there ,is a growing taste for Ameri
can plays and that it will pay to cater to
this taste.
Yet the passion play la doomed; it Is
very doubtful if there will ever be another
satisfactory performance. The reason for
this is evident and cannot be given better
than in Mr. Rawnsley's words: "The al
most insolent familiarities that one saw
taken by thoughtless foreigners with the
village folk, the flatteries and adulations
lavished upon the actors by excited and
admiring crowds, are likely to destroy the
self-respect and simplicity of the people
and to poison the atmosphere in which
alone can grow the life and character
which render the passion play possible."
Already we r.re threatened with a New
York reproduction of the passion play,
wherein professional actors are to be em
ployed for. the principals and unwashed
supers for the chorus. Anything more hor
rible than this it would be difficult to
imagine.
In view of all this the anti-expansionists of the
North who support Bryan are gold brick buyers.
They are the victims of a political bunko game.
He would rather fill his paper with an inquiry
whether an ostrich can better digest a sodawater bottle
empty or filled with Bourbon whisky and corked tight
than reproduce Colonel Bryan's tiresome tatters of
quotations from Lincoln, and his tremors over im
perialism. The Southerners know what they want.
Fitzhugh Lee visited the reunion of Mosby's men in
Virginia the other day and in his speech opposed
yielding an inch in the Philippines or anywhere else.
In the South an acorn off Robert E. Lee's old mili
tary hat goes further than all Colonel Bryan's rhetoric
AH this is perfectly understood in the South.
Kenry Watterson is for holding the Philippines, and,
omitting to discuss the paramount issue in the.
Courier-Journal, is sweating over the problem
whether President Cleveland was in favor of tariff re
form!
Tlie South will permit Bryan to give up the Philip
pines when the extinct dodo is refleshed and feathered
and lays eggs no bigger than a bean in a humming
bird's nest, and when the ornithorhynchus, hard up
for amusement, separates into his component parts of
fish, fowl and beast and fights both his ends against
the middle for a share of the gate money.
Does Mr. Schurz think that Mr. Hearst will spend
as much big type and fetid breath hauling down the
banner as he has in screeching "Nail the flag to the
Philippines?"
Do Mr. Garrison, Governor Boutwell, Senator
Henderson and the Springfield Republican imagine*
that Bryan will send Morgan to impiously pull down
the divinely planted flag?
It is said that "in vain is the snare spread in the
sight of the bird." Does it apply to man and to poli
tics? Colonel Bryan is setting the snare in the sight
of the Northern anti-expansionist to catch his vote
for the benefit of the Southern expansionist. Will it
work? Will William Lloyd Garrison pull Senator
Morgan's chestnuts out of the fire? Morgan said in
San Francisco in 189S, "Our flag is in the Philippines
to stay. God planted it there."
Already every influential Democratic paper in that
section has poohpoohed Colonel Bryan's "paramount
issue" out of the campaign. Seven out of ten of the
Southern dailies are openly for holding the Philip
pines, and, with frankness 'for which they deserve
credit, say that if Colonel Bryan is elected they will
see that he does not make a fool of himself on that
subject.
That is the sentiment of the South to-day, and it is
not diluted by any fine spun theories about consent
of the governed, lifting up the lowly or civilizing the
savage. They have an eye to the profit of it to them
selves. They want to sell cotton and other things
which they produce in excess of their own needs.
Spain was influenced against the sale by some of the
Cabinets of Continental Europe, whereupon James
Buchanan, Minister to England, John Y. Mason,
Minister to France, and Slidell, Minister to Spain,
met at Ostend and did a most extraordinary thing.
They issued what is known as the Ostend manifesto,
in which they assumed to declare the foreign policy
of this Government. They declared that whenever
any territory, anywhere, was necessary to the protec
tion or profit of the United States, we had the right
to take such territory, regardless of the protest of the
sovereignty to which it belonged or the wish of the
people who inhabited it!
The South and the Democracy always wanted Cuba.
During Pierce's administration an effort was made
to buy the island of- Spurn, without consulting the
people or the consent of the governed.
\^e repeat, the South is the only section of -this
country that is nearly unanimous for holding the Phil
ippines. It goes further. It wants Cuba and is not
patient with the steps taken by the President to let
that island go.
COLONEL BRYAN considers 120 votes from
the South so safe for him that he pays little at
tention to Dixie and penetrates it no farther
than the cold edges of Maryland and West Virginia.
The South, the cotton States, that South which rules
that section, is for expansion, for holding the Philip
pines and looking around for something else to grab.
THE SOUTH fJND EXPANSION.
CHICAGO TIMES-HERALDâ There is
no problem before the American people
that approaches in its importance and dif
ficulties that which compels the intelligent
and patriotic white citizen of the South to
refrain from voting because he will r.ot
stultify his intelligence by supporting
Bryanism. and yet feels that his duty to
his State and his race precludes opposition
to the party which in many Southern
States is the only bulwark against nÂ«gro
domination.
ST. LOUIS GLOBE-DEMOCRATâ Four
years ago Mr. Schurz said that if the
country elected Bryan It would "rot to
death in the loathsome stew of Its own
corruption." But Schurz will vote for
Bryan this time under the supposition
that the free silver champion is to be
heavily chained by Republicans during
the coming short session of Congress.
BALTIMORE AMERICANâ One natu
rally shrinks in horror as he sees Galves
ton's death list growing even larger, and
stands appalled at the enormous property
loss. But the calamity has proven that
American manhood is not cold, not void
of the tenderer sentiments. From every
hamlet, town and city in the land flows
the succoring stream of currency and
supplies, until it reaches Galveston by the
millions.
CHICAGO RECORDâ The maintenance
of armies on Chinese soil is a menace not
to China, but to the peace of Europe and
America. The United States could not
take any step that would more redound to
its honor and foresight than that of asking
the other powers to send representatives
to an International congress. And if
"peace with honor" is ever to come out of
this unfortunate situation auch a confer
ence probably will be the means by which
that result will be attained.
NEW YORK TRIBUNEâ It is easy for
the Democrats to talk about trusts and
coal barons, but until they can point out
specifically what the Republican party
could do, what they would do. If in power,
to give the miners higher wageg anil
cheaper powder, and remove their oth-r
particular grievances. It is the basest
demagogy for them to try to inflame a
class of people with prejudice and delude
them with false notions of how to cure
their- troubles.
NEW YORK SUN â Galveston will prove
again, as Chicago and Charleston have
done, that though man cannot avert inch
terrible calamities, yet the pluck a:v!
moral fiber that are his will help him to
rise superior even to these afflictions.
PITTSBURG DISPATCHâ In the half
developed civilization of three centuries
ago it was considered civilized warfare to
sack a town that had offered resistance.
But even then it was recognized as bar
barity to loot End burn an Undefended
city. Is it not a bitter commentary that
the joint invasion of civilization int->
China should violate the rule of civilized
war at the closs of feudalism?
BOSTON TRANSCRIPTâ The prayer ci
those Gold Democrats who are now join
ing the party of Bryan should be that of
the Greek sase: "Teach me not to re
member, but to forget."
NEW YORK TRIBUNEâ Here wÂ» are
all agog over this miserable silver busi
ness, a thing: that ous?ht to be as dead
here as royat prerogative in England,
much deader than Bourbonlsm in France,
and as far beyond resurrection as the
Holy Roman empire. And by the same
occasion a large part of our people clamor
for a policy of scuttling out of obilsa
tions of honor and duty and the spurnin?
of all national aspirations born since ITsTj.
ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCHâ Already
Galveston look forward, r.ot backward; on
the ruins of the old. the people of the sea
island contemplate a new Galveston
greater, fairer and more prosperous.

That is a formidable list, and it will be seen the
ground to be fought over is a broad one. It is too
early to undertake to forecast the result. The doubt
ful element in the contest is the vote in Quebec. Or
dinarily the French of that province would support
their fellow citizen and the representative of their race,
Laurier, but his action in sending Canadian troops to
help the British in South Africa is said to have alien
ated many voters of French descent, and it is believed
his party will suffer in consequence.
at their meetings. Summing up the demands of the
Conservatives , the Toronto Mail and Empire says:
"Our western territories must be wrested from the
grip of the Siftonian speculator, and a population
that will assimilate must be thrown in. Markets must
be found for our produce which under proper .condi
tions will increase vastly in quantity. The preference
which the British people will give must be secured.
From the money-making coteries which infest Ottawa
the country must be relieved. The deals must be
stopped. Common honesty in administration, with
absolute freedom from 'rake-off,' must be introduced.
Equal justice must be administered. There must no
longer be one law excusing Lemieux, the offender,
and another law punishing Woods, the loyal man.
The taxes must come down by several millions, and
money that passes to Ottawa must be left in the chan
nels of trade and industry. The racialist who divides
the people must go, and the machine which steals our
votes must pass out also."

Hail Sample Ballot to Every
Voter.
The announcement made by the Auditor
yesterday that he was not satisfied with
the way in which a demand for stamps to
the value of $?C0 wa.Â« presented to him for
auditing by the Election Commissioner*
has Impelled Registrar Walsh to rise In
explanation. WalPh says that under an
opinion of City Attorney Lane the Elec
tion Commissioners are not bound by the
charter regarding stationery to be fur
nished to the various departments. He
EayB that the law compels the mailing of
a "sample ballot to every vo,ter five dnys
before the election. It isÂ« expected that
75,000 ballots will have to be mailed, cost-
Ing at one cent **ach $750. Notices must
elso be pent to 2400 election officers, which
at two cents is $iS. The cost then Is but
$2 less than the requisition sent to the
Auditor.
Walsh says the demand was slfrn<nl by
the) Supervisors' Finance Committee,
though that course is not necessary. He
says the money was to be expended for
stamps and no other purpose, and he has
complied with the Auditor's request to
make It payable to the postofflce authori

These endowments are enormous: probably

Institution. The entire benefit Is for the peo

a thousand and more of our youth, among the
brightest of the land, would be compelled to

go without it. or the people would have to sub

the Etate University to accommodate them.
The people have everything to gain and noth

They can reject It If they choose, but In that
ca?e' they would be lining an unwise thing for
themselves and for their posterity.
I do not think It necessary to point out all
the weaknesses of the act of the Legislature
(the founding act). I do not think It even wise
to do *n. In view cf th* fact that this consti
tutional amendment may not be adopted. By
the proposed constitutional amendment the

Secondâ The provision that the Legislature
may exempt personal property can do no harm
to the State. The personal or^pertv of the
university will necessarily consist almost ex
clusively of approved securities. If tills amend
ment does not pass, securities will n^cefsarlly.

It Is not compelled to exempt all that it la

time.
Sixthâ If any exemption Is made, it Is only

and It always will have.

Firstâ No real estate can be excmrteJ from
county or local taxes except In the county of
Santa Clara, where the university grounds &ni
buildings are situated. Therefore no county
or city treasury can be made, poorer D/ reason
It will be observed from the reading of this
proposed amendment that the following prop
ositions are true: :
"'All property now or hereafter held In
tru?t for the founding, maintenance or benefit
of the ]>lan<l Stanford Jr. University, or of
any department thereof, may bÂ» exempted by
special act from State taxation, and all per
sonal property so held, ami Palo Alto farm as
described In the endowment grant to the trus
tees of the university, and all other real prop
erty so held and used by the university for edu
cational pur-poies exclusively, may be similarly
exempted from county and municipal taxation;
provided, that resident*' of California shall be
charged no fees for tuition unless such fees
be authorized by the act of the Legislature."
The constitutional amendment also provides
that to a limited extent the Legislature may
(not muÂ«t> exempt from taxation a portion of
the property of the university. This provision
Is of so small Importance, compared with the
other parts of the amendment, that I am sorry
it is there at all, should it in the least endan
ger the adoption of the amendment. Not that
it should do so if understood, but the trouble
Is that so many people will not take the pains
to understand It and therefore vote against the
entire amendment on account of this taxation
clause. That part of the amendment reads as
follows:
There is a matter, however, which I think
eunrht to bo here mentioned. I understand on
the best of authority that a gentleman. r e S i
dfnt of another country, closely related to the
late Senator Stanford, and who, like the late
Senator, is without Immediate heirs. Intend?,
if he can legally do ?o. to leave by will al
mrvst all of hln vaÂ»t ectate to the Iceland Stan
ford Jr. University. But the statute en which
that university was founded provides that
property may be given by "^rant" (no provis
ion being made for property left by will), and
rrovides that such pror>erty so granted shall
be "any property, real or personal, belonging
to such person, and situated or being- within
this State." This would seem to preclude the
university from receiving any property not
within the Stat?. The propoi-ed constitutional
amendment cures this defect, and also pro
vides that property may be given to the uni
versity by will, as well as by grant. I know
of at least one other person who Is , without

FRIENDS OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY
TO SUPPORT AMENDMENT VITAL TO IT
in Kerrigan's Presence.
James L. Crittenden, president of the
People's Mutual Telephone Company, and
William Saalburg, one of the proprietors
of the Jewish Times and Observer, came
within an ace of being- sent to jail fÂ«r con
tempt of court by Justice of the Peace
Kerrigan yesterday. If It had not been
that there was nothing pending before thÂ©
court at the time the two Individuals, who
were respectively defendant and plaintiff
In a suit, would have languished In the
City Prison until their tempers cooled.
The Incident occurred juut after Justice
Kerrigan had decided In favor of Saal
burg, who had sued' the Peoples Tele
phone Company for $45. alleged to be due
for an advertisement.
CrittPnden was granted five days' stay
of execution and was walking out of the
courtroom when Saalburg accosted him
and began to argue. Crittenden brushed
Saalburg away, and the latter told him
not to make a fool of himself.
Crittenden. whose ire had become
aroused, backed Saalburg around the
courtroom, at the same time using rather
strong language. Saalburg picked up the
pitcher of water lying on the Judge's desk
and threatened to treat Crittenden to a
cold bath.
Justice Kerrigan, who had retired from
the room previous to the commencement
of hostilities, came back just then to try
another case and rapped for order. As
the threatening attitude of the belliger
ents did not change Judge Kerrigan said:
"Gentlemen, If this does not stop I will
send b"oth of you to jail." and the com
batants concluded to cease further hos
tilities.
NEARLY SENT TO JAIL
FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT
James L. Crittenden and William
Saalburg Almost Came to Blows
Chairman Reed of the Supervisors'
Public Utilities Committee announced
yesterday that the proposition of acquir
ing a municipal water system for this
city will be ready for submission to a vote
of the people on February 1, 1901. "While
the surveys of Lake Tahoe arjd the Amer
ican and Yuba rlvefs~ have been some
what delayed owing to the illness of Lu
ther Wagoner, chief of the department of
public utilities in the Board of Public
Works, it is believed that a full report of
the Invest ig/ation will be filed on Novem
ber 1, 1900.
There will be two propositions submitted
to the people. One is that of bringing
the water from the Sierras and the other
contemplates the purchase of the Spring
Valley Â¦ Water Company's plant. The
voter will have the privilege of expressing
his preference 1 on either of the two propo
sitions at the polls.
Reed says that if it is finally determined
that the cost of bringing' water from the
Sierras is $5O,0u0,iX)0, then the estimate of
$35,000,000 which the Spring Valley Water
Company places on its system is not far
from being correct. Reed asserts as an
argument in favor of acquiring either the
Spring: Valley or Sierra systems that the
average cost'of water to the consumers of
this city is $211 per 1.000.000 gallons, which
is from seven to fourteen times higher
than any other city in the United States.
Reed says that the surveys of the
watersheds and available routes of the
Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers will not
cost this city 1 cent. Wagoner, who has
been employed by the United States Gov
ernment, recently filed his report, and it
will be available for use by San Francisco
in the prosecution of the project to ac
quire a wholesome and sufficient water
supply.
Propositions Will Be Ready
for Submission Next
February.
People Will Express at the Polls
Preference for , ? Either Spring
Valley or Sierra Sup
plies.

Being earnestly requested by some of our most prominent ladles an*
buMness men. we have decided to arrance the names in the next edition
of The BJue Book numerically, according to streets and numbers. The
odd numbers on one side and the even on the other, elvtng the Indi-
vidual members of each family, also classified alphabetically. The chief
object 1Â« to furnish a directory by which you can find a name by know-
Ing the residence number, or find the residence by knowing the name.
Owing to the numeroux chances caused by removals, deaths, mar-
riage!", changes In reception days and the substitution of new num.
bers for old In the residence districts. The Blue Book this year will
assume an importance never before equaled in the history of the pub-
lication.
The Club Department will contain a complete list of the leading clubs,
riving the officers, directors and an official list of the members, with
their business addresses. The Ladles' Clubs will be a special feature.
The work will contain a street and avenue guide, calling and address
list, theater dlairrams, personnel of the pre?e, winter guests of the lead-
Ing hotels, suburban residents, army and navy, shopping guide. Includ-
ing a list of the very best places to trade. Also the Street Railway Guide,
arranged alphabetically, containing the various street-car routes and
transfer points, giving a ready reference to any number and the car to
take at a glance.

STORIES OF DISASTERS
COME IN FROM THE SEA
In Captain Wlnslow's storerooms were
found a number of Chinese tea sets
marked with the name of his Chinese
servant. /The Mongolian had his name
also on a half dozen embossed pictures
and he claimed that ne had brought "lots
over before and no trouble."
The find of the day, however, was made
by Inspector Davidson. Stored away
among the medical stores were two trunks
parked Colonel Meade and Captain Rit
tenhouse. In each trunk were found sev
eral suits of fur garments valued at sev
eral hundred dollars. The marines, being
the first to enter Tientsin, had every op
portunity to loot and, judging from the
amount of stuff boxed and addressed to
the officers of the marine corps, they let
no chance slip.
The pay department, chief engineer's
department and that portion of the ship
under the direct control of Lieutenant
Coflin were the only parts of the vessel
where the inspectors found no goods.
Dr. Steppe was particularly unfortunate
in that while he brought nothing for nim
self he was kind enough to take chanre
of several packages left in his care, prom
ising to deliver them to the people to
Â¦whom they were addressed. The inspect
ors relieved him of the responsibility yes
terday. On opening the packages which
the doctor had In his charge silK and
Chinese garments were found.
The inspectors brought thirty-eight pack
ages of goods found In the Solace to this
city yesterday on the noon trip of the
steamer Montlcello. It Is a matter of
note that while the crew gave up without
any talk all dutiable goods In their pos
session the officers endeavored at all times
to throw the inspectors off the track.
.It remained for the force of Inspectors
who Etayed aboard the transport Solace
to discover the main articles of value
concealed In the ship. Yesterday Inspect
ors Davidson, Leahy nnd Lorenzen broke
open the storeroom connected with the
medical department of the vessel and un
earthed thousands of dollars' worth of
Oriental finery oa which no duty had
been paid.

Southern California has benefited by pursu
ing a liberal policy In Inviting and encourag
ing the advent of outside capital. Where
local capital is Inadequate, it is beneficial to
all to welcome the outside Investor, and where
Mineral Wealth, published at Redding,
Shasta County, is trying to coax the
northern counties of California to exert
themselves more toward showing that
they "are still on tne map." ' The South
west Miners' Association has appointed
a committee to arrange for a complete
exhibit of metals and minerals from
Southern California at the next annual
meeting of the International Mining Con
gress, to be held at Boise City next July.
Mineral Wealth says:
It was but a short time ago. to be reckoned
In weeks, when there was not a stamp drop
plr.g In the county. With the extensive devel
opment going on, which Is backed by capital
not recklessly expended, and which is not risked
without more than a probability of its being
materially increased, a truly bright and pros
perous future seems opening up for old Mari
posa. In former days gold was taken from her
many mines in astounding quantities, and it
is not claimed even by the most thoughtless
that the supply Is exhausted. With machinery
vastly superior to that used In early days It Is
no more than reasonable to believe that as yet
the county has yielded but a very small per
centage of her mineral wealth.
Hardly a week passes in which renewed inter
est in this county Is not manifested. The de
velopment work being done by the Mariposa
Commercial and Mining Company is on a more
gigantic scale than that of any other one com
pany or owner in the county, and while more
attention Is paid to the operations on their
properties than tq others, still they are in pos
session of but a small part of the mining in
terests of the county. In all directions, from
tho copper mines In the southern part of the
county to the mines north and east of Coulter
vllle, come reports of work being recommenced
on old mines and the location and development
of new claims. â¢ â¢ â¢
The Marlposan editorially dwells on
the mining operations In Mariposa Coun
ty. It says:
The London correspondent of the New
York Commercial sees a large demand
for copper In the near future, owing to
many conditions. He says: "The great
developments now taking place In Eng
land in the application of electric trac
tion and power, the additional telegraph
cables about to be laid (including the Pa
cific cable of 8800 miles, estimated to re
quire some 4000 tons of copper), the largo
quantity of copper used for ammunition,
and the additional 5000 tons required for
the manufacture of sulphate of copper
during the next six months, will neces
sitate a great increase in the consump
tion of copper In this country for the rest
of this year."
In Summit County surprising discoveries are
of frequent occurrence. A case in point Is a
recent strike of free gold ore In the Germania
mine, which has heretofore been noted for Its
high-grade silver and lead product. In follow
ing the main silver vein a streak of iron was
encountered^ln which free gold was found, from
which grab'and average ramples returned as
says of 75 and 20 ounces of gold, respectively.
It is the frequency of discoveries of this kind
In all the leading sliver producing camps of
the State that gives continued new Impetus to
the development of the mines and adds no in
considerable part to the mineral wealth of Colo
rado.
AVhere gold and Bilver are mined together, in
some Instances the value of one equals that of
the other, and in some cases, as in the big
mines of Leadville, the sold exceeds. A recent
illustration which foreshadows wonderful reve
lations in what was once the leading orthodox
Ellver camp in the State was recently furnished
by noted pioneer silver mines of Georgetown.
At the 6C0 level of one of them a streak vary
ing from 15 to 30 Inches was encountered where
the solid vein ore ran $25 per ton, silver and
gold, but from the streak the returns were 5.7
ounces in gold per ton. In the other a similar
strike was made, where the solid ore yielded
a combined value of $60, of which 15 ounces
were In silver and the greater part of the resi
due was gold. In other portions of Clear Creek
County it is one of the characteristics of the
mines that gold and sliver are found togethei;
in constant association from the shallow work
ings to the deci> levels.
A correspondent writes that the gold
product of the Cripple Creek district this
year will amount to $30,000,000. The same
authority calls attention to the "trans
formation of the sliver mines in several
Colorado districts Into gold mines." He
says:
"While this proposition," says the
journal before mentioned, "partakes
somewhat of the practice of the
old style shoemaker of making the
foot lit the shoe rather than the shoe lit
the foot, yet it strongly evidences the
fact that the capital of the East is begin
ning to seek the mines instead of the
mines seeking capital, which has been the
experience since the industry of mining
began in America, The era of speculative
Investment In Industrial enterprises seems
to be nearing an end, and timid capital,
if not evincing a desire to 'get from un
der,' at least is finding difficulty in mak
ing investments with fair promise ot
safety and liberal dividends; hence It
turns to other avenues, and none are
found so promising as those leading- to the
mines."
That mining Is on the boom Is satisfac
torily evidenced by tho fact that during
the lirst eight months of the present year
the dividends paid out by mining com
panies as reported amounted to $27,155,530,
which is 8 per cent upon the total capital
stock of the companies reporting.
There is ample evidence that mining Is
attracting a much greater share of atten
tion in New York than was the case a
few years ago. The Western Mining
World calls attention to a. press dispatcn
to the effect that a syndicate of ten
wealthy men has provided a fund of
$100,000 for search and prospecting, which
they have placed in the hands of a promi
nent mining engineer, who will look for
valuable mining properties in tho West.
"Mining Is booming everywhere except
In New York City." This is the verdict
of the American Mining News, and the
text is sufficient to lead tho Journal to ad
vocate tho establishment of. a national
mining display In New York. Money Is
plentiful in the metropolis. That Is one
argument used. Another of the pictur
esque sort is that In New York "there Is
more ignorance concerning tho mineral
wealth and prospects of the United States
than anywhere else."

MINING BOOM IS
ATTRACTING THE

The Calaveras Prospect says that the
opening cf tbe Lucky Roy or Walters
mine on the Copperopolls road promises
much for San Andreas. The ineorpora
tors are nearly all Boston people. The
Lucky Boy is between the TTtica and the
Gwin mines and is about the same dis
tance irom each.

lapse of time and changes since "they wercf*

The Calaveras Prospect reports that the
extension of the Sheep Ranch mine has
been found. Work on the Central Hill
gravel mine has been suspended for th<*
season. _
The Densmoro mine in Tuolumne County
will be worked on a larger scale than
heretofore. Large dei'eloprcent work 13
proceeding in a group of mines near tha
old Riverside mine.
The county registers of mining, compiled
by State Mineralogist Cooper, are at last
comlnp from the press and the maps will
soon follow. They were held up when the
The Caminettl law and the Injunction
suits concerning: several hydraulic mines
will take up some of the time of the con
vention.
The association could maintain a. uurran of
general mining information, do much to broad
ly advertise the industry, and Us headquarters
should be the constant meeting place ci" visit
ing mining men from all over the Statt. AÂ« It
is the work of the secretary Is a severe tax
on his time and business. To make the as
sociation the constant and active loree it
might be plainly requires the undivided t.me
of an efficient executive officer.
One of the many thing's the association could
do is the establishment of a registration bureau
for the miners, mlllmen, foremen, aaiayers,
mining engineers, surveyors and so on, by
which employers and employes could be brought
tctether. Durin* the past two years I hare
kept such a register and nave filled probably
seventy-Ove positions of all kinds through
people registering for employment and employ
ers coming or writing In search of help. Thia
work could be jroatly expanded If t.it neces
sary time could bÂ« constantly given to li.
The annual convention of the California
Miners' Association will be opened in this
city Monday, November 16. and will con
tinue three days. Secretary E. H. Benja
min has sent out official notice. The call
for the meeting: is signed by President W.
C. Ralston and Secretary Benjamin.
Therein a large attendance of delegations
Js requested and the customary reduction
In rallv/ay fares Is announced. Among the
topics to be considered by the convention
Is that of securing a new State mining- lo
cation law from the next Legislature. The
conflict between the scrlppers and the
Elacer locators of mineral oil lands will
e a topic of Interest. The constitution
and by-laws of the association may be
revised to effect a partial reorganization.
Mr. Benjamin says the association needs
a salaried secretary to carry out In detaJl
the work ordered by It. The result would
be a large Increase In the membership,
which ought to be at least 15,000. The
present membership la between 9000 and
10,000. Mr. Benjamin also makes the fol
lowing suggestions:
The six Southern California counties of Los
Angeles. Kern, Riverside, San Bernardino, San
Diego and Ventura produced $1,616,208 in 1SS9.
The six N'orthÂ«?rn California countiesâ Shasta.
Trinity, Sisklyou. Lassen, Humboldt and E>*1
Norteâ produced $6,369,446 durinpr the same year.
These figures cover the production of gold, sil
ver and copper and show the comparative
value of the two districts, and yet we are si
lent, while cur southern neighbors are publish
ing to the world the advantages offered in
their section for the investment of mining
capital.
the big operators pursue a liberal policy It re
dounds to their benefit as well as to the dis
trict at large. The experience in mining or re
ducing ores in a certain district gleaned by
one operator la beneficial to all. The\ large
camps of Montana and Colorado are examples
of this character of reciprocity. Intelligent
relflshness, therefore, should bring about a
change of method in this end of the Stateâ
we should be as active as our Southern neleh
bors, as we will surely not suffer from com
parison.

AÂ«"_it Joe Jsjncsnn, tvho Trent to Galves
ton Itaiâ -Staiâjr after the storm and took
a position as Inspector on the staff of tho
adjutant general, returned here to-day
â n<5 rr.axje a full report of the situation in
the devastated city to Governor Sayers.
He staled that never before in the hi.'--
Tory of the world was such p'.uck shown
as is row being displayed by the people
of Galveston. Uespite the _reat difficul
ties that confront them all are of one
mind In the matter of rebuilding the city.
Mr. Jameson estimates that hardly a per
son who was a resident of Galveston and
survived the storm will remove from
there. Of those who were sent to Houston
and other places during the first few days
e-fter the disaster many are already re
turning and are preparing to re-establish
their homes. There is no longer any
exodus from the city. The nospita.ls arÂ«
empty and are being used to house the
destitute women and children who are
m-ithout homes. Carpenters ind contract
ors are arriving on every train and boat,
_ji<3 he tays ThÂ«Â»re is Â¦work for as many
of this class of artisans as can get oa
the island. The contractors who are re
moving the debris expect to have 2500
men at Trork by Monday morning.
Mr. Jameson says that up to this time
comparatively little of the debris has been
removed, lie says that there are doubt
less hundreds of dead human bodies stili
jn the wreckag-e and that the number yec
to be recovered til the eitv from the piles
rl debris may reach 2000. He estimates
That the minimum number of storm vic
tims in Galveston nnd the mainland ag
gregated lO.OW. Some conservative men
vrho have closely investigated the situa
tion p]ace the number of victims at 14,000.

"With the exception of the abolishment

After his speech at Firth, Mr. -Bryan
drove to Haltam, a distance of nine miles,
and there made the last speech of the
day.
LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 22.â Mr. Bryan
to-day continued his canvass of the First
Nebraska Congressional District, starting
out early in an automobile. 1 He intended
to make three speeches before returning
late to-night. The first stop was made
at Waverley, In Lancaster. County, where
he talked in a familiar strain as to old
neighbors, dwelling chiefly on the evils
of imperialism and militarism, as he views
these questions.
At Klrth Mr. Bryan addressed a crowd
composed mainly of Holland Dutch. He
was introduced by a speaker In theDutch
language^ His speech was in the main
an argument against the policy of the ad
ministration in the Philippines. He said
that after traveling more or less over the
United States he wa3 satisfied that the
country was big enough without taking
in the Philippine Islands.
In reply to an Inquiry from the crowd
as to whether he did not believe that we
should have a coaling station at Manila,
Mr. Bryan said that the Filipinos had al
ways stood ready to give us a coaling sta
tion there, "but," he said, "the trouble
Is that we have wanted to hold all the
land to see whether there was any coal
there," and In the language of a member
of Congress it was, he said, significant
that one of the first acts of the Govern
ment after Dewey's victory was to give
instructions to ascertain w r hether theie
was coal In the archipelago. This inquiry
was undertaken tn the summer, but if the
taking of the Philippines was the Lord's
work, what was the need of coal at tha.t
season of the year? If it was the devil's
work ho would, of course, need coal at
any season."
Says He Is Convinced the United
States Is Large Enough Wit-tout
Taking In the Philip
pine Islands.

An Interesting fight for the possession
of "Santa Teresa," the alleged, divine
healer and guardian angel of the Yaqul
Indians, began yesterday afternoon when
Mrs. Beatrice Castro, 634 Chestnut street,
Oakland, who claims to be a personal
friend of the healer's family, swore to a
complaint before Judge Cabaniss charging
J. H. Suits, her manager, with keeping
her under control and against her will Jn
the Baldwin Annex. Mrs. Castro said
that "Santa Teresa" had complained to
her that she was virtually kept a prisoner
by Suits and she wanted to get her liber
ty. Mrs. Castro was accompanied by
Madame Young, the. spiritualist, and Mrs.
A. Rits, 502 Washington street.
The warrant was handed to Detective
Dillon and he was accompanied to the
Baldwin Annex by ex-Judge Treadwoll.
Treadwell saw "Santa .Teresa" and she
told him that she was there voluntarily
and had no desire to leave. Dillon is a
Bufferer from rheumatism. "Santa Te
resa" placed her hands on him and he de
clared that she cured himt but it did not
prevent hint from arresting Suits, who
put up $500 bonds and was released. lie
claimed that his. arrest was an outrago
and he was willing that "Santa .Teresa,"
who was under contract to him, should be
questioned by the official. Interpreter at
once as. to whether she was a prisoner.
The case will be called to-morrow morn
ing. .
J. H. Suits, Her Manager, Arrested
for Detaining Alleged Divine
Healer as a Prisoner.

Mr. L_ne also advises the Supervisors
that the resolution granting permission to
the Market-street Hallway Company to
operate its Fifth-street road by means
of electricity is le^al and the board has
the power to grant such a privilege. In
regard to the right of the Market-street
Railway Company to "electrize" its road
running along First and Battery streets,
using the streets for the erection of poles
and the stringing of wires. Lane says the
right to change one form of propelling
power to another, with the consent of
the municipal council, cannot De denied.
The charter does not exiireissly or Implledly
forbid overhead wires. The Board of Super
visor- may grant or withhold such privilege as
It may think best, or limit or control or res_
late such privilege either as to manner of use
or time of use. If the city, acting through Us
legislative body, denies the use of the streets
for overhead wires conveying - electric current
for ulrevt railroad Bervlce. no other board can
be comoelled by legal proceedings to grant a
permit for tuch use. On the other hand, If the
Board of Supervisors determines that such U'io
will be beneficial to the public, no other board
car. veto such determination.
That such "structures" as telegraph, electric
UrM or electric power poles were not intended
to come under the provision of the charter is
evident from other portions of the same para
graph unrtor which the Board of Public Work*
Is authorized "in conformity with the ordin
ances of the Board of Supervlnors to grant p<Â»r
inits Tor the erection of telegraph and lejfi
khor.e poles, and poles for electric light!.!*."
Such const! uctions were not to be regarded as
permanent encroachments. Electric railway
Doles are, in the language of the Supn.me
Court of Rhode Island, "to be regarded, not as
incumberins the streets, but an ministering to
their uses, and as increasing the facilities for
travel which thry afford to the public."
The opinion Is Interesting because there
is at present an ordinance in force pro
hibiting overhead wires in the downtown
district. Lane says that such structures
as telegraph, electric lisht or electric
power poles are not to be regarded as per
manent encroachments or an incumbrance
In any sense of thÂ© word. The opinion
says:
City Attorney Lane handed down an im
portant opinion yesterday to the effect
that the Board of Supervisors has the

"I had for about two years been un-
der considerable physical and mental
strain, _nd my nervous system seemed
to utterly give way. I had some excel-
lent physicians, but their remedial
agencies failed to reach the caseâ at
best affording only temporary relief.
"At the time the family left my atten-
tion was called to Grape-Nuts food.
Several things had led me to believe
that my troubles were lareelv due to im-
proper nutrition. The absence of the
familv pave me a pood opportunity to
try the new food, for it is perfectly
cooked and therefore required no work
on my part.
"So I began to make two meals a
<*'3>\ supper and breakfast, on Grape-
Nuts and cream or milk, and had noth-
ing else. I confined myself to the
proper allowance, .not overeatine. The
improvement was marked, almost from
the first â my digestion was better, sleep
became regular and restful, and I began
to c-in flesh. I could soon do work
with less fatigue and more satisfaction.
"My rervous system has been won-
derfully improved, and to-day I weich
more than I have ever weiprhed. and find
my strength equal to all the responsibil-
ity. This is not all; on the return of
the family Grape-Xuts became a recrular
nrticle of food at the morniner hour.
The children ate it and improved.
"My wife, who was nursinz an infant,
discovered that after she besran usintr
Grape-Nuts rejrularly. for the first time
in many years Nature's food supply for
the baby was adequate without resortine:
to artificial subterfuges. Grape-Nuts
food not only carried us throueh the
sickly season, but has been a codsend to
oar entire family."

William Kent Described Operations
of Municipal Voters' League in
the Windy City.
William Kent, president of the Muni
cipal Voters?' League of Chicaco, ad
dressed an audience yesterday artemoou
in the assembly hall of the Mills building
concerning the work <u the league in thÂ»
direction of purifying the Chicago Boara
of Aldermen. Mr. Kent was formerly a
Califorr.lan and a resident of Mari^i
County. He went to Chicago in 1SS7 an<l
(subsequently became a member of th-e
Hoaid of Chicago Aldermen. "In 1S96.-"
said Mr. Kent, "the Aldermanic board
consisted of sixty-eight members. Ten
of these were honest men. The remainder
could justly have been suspected. ,. I saw
what was going on and interested myscif
in trying to bring about better condi
tions'."
Two years ago, it will be recollected,
there was a mass-meeting of Chicago cit
izens at Battery D. at which there were
ropes in evidence, and the avowed inten
tion of seme of the attendants at the
meeting was to hanÂ£ boodle Alderman
with thf-m if they should venture to vote
for the Allen bill, which would have ex
tended the life of traction and other fran
chlaee from twenty to fifty years. Wil
liam Kent drew the resolutions that were
adopted at that meeting, which declared
that the Aldermen should not do certain
things. This was tantamount to a threat
and wan so understood. There were, so
Mr. K^nt paid. 10,000 members of the
league in Chicago.
The working of the Chicago league was
described. There is an executive commit
tee of nine members and they hold oftice
for a term of three years. They ascertain
and publish all about the official acts of
the Aldermen and have "condemned" and
"approved" lists to put before the public.
Out of this course of procedure have come
throe libel suits against the league, but
the league has won in all. When there are
new men proposed for office the league
requests them to furnish facts about their
lives and also to give the names of Â»lx
men of whom inquiries can be made coo
eerninjr their fitness for office. These par
ties are then interrogated and private In
quiry is made in ail directions. If any
candidate is found to have been guilty of
dlsÂ«hcr.est acts, either in public or pri
vate, his name Is put on the "condemned"
list and the members of the league vote
against him and use their influence to de
feat him for office.
Mr. Kent also said that the league does
not consider the politics of any candidate
nor devs it nominate for office. He report
ed that the Chicago Aldermen were a re
spectable body owinp to the work of the
If ague in keeping bad men out.

Charles R. Wideberg, Gregory Walsh
and F. J. Stanton are also members of
the staff.
The Board of Public Works has selected
Leonard S. Leavy and T. J. Crowley, who
are already employed in the office, to be
bookkeepers.
TWO devout Catholic scholars saw
the crowning of their ambitions
yesterday. They are J. William
Brockhage and Francis M. Harvey.
After years of close study they
were permitted to enter the priesthood of
the Catholic church, and during the re
mainder of their lives are to devote all
their time ministering to the living and
the dead.
The ceremony of ordination was per
formed in St. Mary's Cathedral by his
Grace the Most Rev. P. W. Riordan with
the most solemn services. Both young
men were profoundly impressed with the
step they were taking and the large con
gregation which tilled the sacred edifice
joined its prayers to those uttered by the
Archbishop to instill courage and devotion
into the hearts of the young priests who
were just entering on their great mission.
The ceremonies of ordination were ac
companied by a solemn high mass, at
which the Archbishop was assisted by
the Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast, St.
Mary's Cathedral: Rev. Father Vuibert,
S. S., St. Patrick's Seminary: Rev. Father
McSweeney of Oakland; Rev. Father
O'Rlordan of Berkeley; Rev. Father
Praught, Temescal; Rev. Father Hevrin.
Oakland; Rev. Father Collopy. San Jose;
The scene at the altar was highly im
pressive. The Archbishop was attired in
his robes of office and the clergymen who
occupied seats in the sanctuary were
dressed ' in their surplices. A score of
acolytes dressed in their striking costumes
and a brilliant background of myriad
candles added to the solemn but beautiful
picture gazed on by the devout congrega
tion. Special music was rendered by the
regular choir during the ceremonies.
Rev. Father Brockhage will sing his
initial mass to-day at St. Francis de
Sales Church, Oakland. Rev. Father Mc-
Sweeney, who was his pastor in years
gone by, will honor him by preaching a
sermon appropriate to the occasion. A
week from to-morrow Rev. Father Har
vey will celebrate his first mass at Holy
Cross Church. Father Sullivan of San
Rafael will preach a special sermon.
The new priests will return to St. Pat
rick's Seminary at Menlo Park and con
tinue their studies while teaching at that
institution.
Rev. Father Sullivan. San Rafael: Rev.
Donald McKlnnon, Rev. Father Cull. Oak

This is to certify that we, the undersigned,
were called ir.to consultation for the purpose of
making a physical Â«-xamlnation of Mrs. Nettle
R. Craven-Fair. Â¦ This examination was made
on Thursday. September 20. between the hours
of 5:30 and 6:30 p. m. in the apartments of the
above-named lady In the California Hotel. The
VttnaSM to the examination were Dr. Charles
A. C!inti;ii and the trained nurse in attendance
on the patient.
While they claim that it would be ex
tremely hazardous to force her to leave
her apartments now, her condition is such
as to Inspire every hope of recovery- They
claim that she is perfectly rational and
that there are signs of returning health
to her paralyzed side. The affidavit in
which these assertions were made was
presented to the court yesterday, and Is as
follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 21, 1900
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven was not called
upon yesterday morning to plead to the
charge of perjury which has been made
against her. Judge Carroll Cook, before
whom she is to be tried, was not In the
city, and Judge Burnett, who Is sitting in
his stead, continued the case until next
Saturday morning, when it is probable
that Mrs. Craven will appear in court.
Her physician, Dr. C. A. Clinton, and Dr.
John A. Williamson and Dr. Edwin Bun

clare that Mrs. Craven is now rapidly on
the mend and there is reason to believe
that she will partially if not wholly re

she has been and is suffering.

A few days ago a very prominent San
Francisco gentleman walked Into the re-
ception room of Ismar, the noted Ejryp-
tian Palmist and Clairvoyant, at 114S Mar-
ket street, opposite Sixth. After awaiting
his turn, passed into the consultation
room. He stated he was skeptical and
had no faith In palmistry or clairvoyance,
and had come to be convinced either one
way or the other. Ismar began that easy-
flow of language of hers and half an hour
afterward the cynic left her room wreath-
ed In smiles. He afterward said: "That
woman Is certainly a wonder. The way
she sailed Into my business affairs and
told mo of my past life â a thousand times
better than I could myself in that length
of time â ls more than remarkable. She
told me of changes I have .been contem-
plating, and advised me to make them.
She told me of family affairs that were
simply astonishing. She also diagnosed
my physical condition and correctly
named the cause of my ailment. I shall
follow her advice and try to get well.
She certainly is all she claims to be, and I
unhesitatingly recommend her to all that
wish to seek her aid and advice." The
evidence of those who have called on
this wonderful woman is of such a nature
as to convince the most skeptical that the
past, present and future can be read. Is-
mar can be consulted daily from 10 a. m.

Mr. Towne spoke at San Leandro from
the porch of the Estudillo House at noon
to-day. In the party which accompanied
him from that place was "Big Mike* Ker
wln the Castro Valley statesman, who
was arrayed In a gorgeous shirt waist.
"Our opponents charge that we are not
expansionists. I say the Democrats are
the only true expansionists. Expansion Is
a growth outward, the same substance be
ing maintained throughout. Imperialism
Is a forced and harmful spreading out, In
â¢wjilch a fruitless endeavor is made to as
similate heterogeneous elements."
campaign of 1900 Is only the cam
paign of 1896 under the head of unfinished
business. There Is nothing Inconsistent
In the fact. that the issue of 1896 is looked
at'somewhat differently this year. It was
then, as now, the interminable struggle
between the few and the many. Then we
were combating the great banking insti
tutions who were endeavoring to depre
ciate one kind of money in order that they
might more readily control the worJd with
another.
J. A. Emory of San Francisco was the
next speaker. "The Issue is Imperialism,"
he declared. "Our nation cannot defy the
moral law and live. This is a time of
danger, not a time for parties, but for
Americanism."
: Mr. Towne was Introduced and spoke
for an hour. He said in part:
"I was present at the Democratic Na
tional Convention." said Mr. Freeman,
"and helped In the construction of the
platform. I believe in every principle
enumerated by It."
J. J. McDonald, chairman of the Demo
cratic County Committee, called the meet
ing to order and Introduced Frank Free
man, the Democratic candidate for Con
gress In this district, as chairman.
OAKLAND, Sept. 22.â A fair-sized audi
ence listened to Charles A. Towne, the
Democratic orator from Minnesota, at the
F.xpositlon building this afternoon. The
heat was oppressive and speakers and
listeners alike suffered from Its effects, A
single masculine shirt waist blossomed out
In tho heat, but jhirt sleeves were the
common dress of the male auditors.

Mr. Henry spoke very briefly and waj
followed by Porter Ashe, candidate for
Congress from the Fourth District, who
spoke eloquently and not so briefly. But
he did not occupy the front of the stage
long, and a song was rendered by the
Columbia Quartet, the four gentlemen in
grotesque costume.

Mr. Lane spoke briefly, asserting that
the signs of the times point to Democratic

It was evident that the Republican party

the front. He concluded by Introducing
a "couple of preliminaries." J. H. Henry
of San Jose, candidate for Congress in the
Fifth District, was the first of these.
Continuing Senator Sims arraigned the
Philippine policy of the administration
and concluded by Introducing Franklin
K. Lane, chairman of the evening.
"We assure him that his rare fame is
cherished as much on the Pacific Coast
as on the Great Lakes or any other por
tion of the Union, and we nope that his
coming will prove . a. new bond between
the East and the coast.'''

evening. He said:

Senator Sims, Franklin K. Lane, J.
There was not Just the enthusiasm the
committee had arranged for, but what
the audience lacked was made up by the
clubs and the bands, and In the end Mr.
Towne received applause sufficient to
fire him to eloquence.
IX5CAL, SPEAKERS HAVE A SAY.
A wait of another quarter hour and the
speaker of the evening arrived. He was
preceded to the stand by a squad of vice
presidents and was escorted by the offi
cers of the State and county central com
mittees and by William H. Alford, Super
ior. Judge Lawlor. Chairman Lane and
others prominent in the ranks.
Then came the Monticello Club with a
brass band that at once went Into active
competition with the one already working
overtime before the grand stand. After
it came the Iroquols Club, led by- another
of thnt tribe, In regalia, and the rest of
the marching organizations, uniformed
and ununi formed.
The audience settled down in the hall
long before the speaker and his escort ar
rived. It was after half. past 8 before a
brave of the Iroquois Club, in war paint
and feathers, wandered into the hall and
against a post opposite the rostrum plant
ed a transparency bearing the â¢ legend,
"Stephen M. White for Senator."
: The decorations were confined solely to
the rostrum up to the time the clubs be
gan to arrive. Then the reserved seats
filled up with a motley array of banners,
transparencies, bunting and uniforms.
peace and quiet could have been held on
any section.
Transparencies of Local ' Candidates
Conspicuously Displayed.
The rostrum, draped over with the stars
and stripes, was placed half-way down
the floor on the west* side of the Pavilion.
It was filled with seats for the 200 and odd
vice presidents that had received honor
ary appointment, and to a few especially
favored "honored guests." Directly In
front of the rostrum 300 chairs were re
served for the. members of the numer
ous uniformed "marching clubs that did
escort duty for the speaker on the way
to the Pavilion. The Iroquols and Mon
tlcello clubs acted as a . special guard of
honor and were accorded the most Â¦ con
spicuous position - on the floor. How
ever, there were seats and to spare for
all the rest without interfering with the
audience. The audience. In fact, was not
large enough to ! Interfere with. Al
though the body of the house was fairly
well -filled, the raised Beats round the
four sides were all but desertedâ a Demo

IN MECHANICS' PAVTLION.
THE opening, rally of the Demo
cratic campaign last night did not
set the city on fire with enthusi
asm. The meeting at Mechanics'
Pavilion was not attended by over
2500 people, that, in fact, being a very lib
eral estimate. Campaign enthusiasm was
at a low ebb, and an occasional outburst
of enthusiasm did not relieve the gather
ing of the atmosphere of frost.
Charles A. Towne of Minnesota held the
attention of the audience for over an hour,
though he failed to rouse them often from
their Indifference/ His voice was some
what hoarse from his vigorous campaign-
Ing and he Bpoke with some effort.
Ex-Congressman Towne's party arrived
from Oakland at 5 o'clock and was driven
to the Palace Hotel.' Mrs. Towne accom
panies her husband, and with them at din
ner at the Palace were M. F. Tarpey.
Senator J. C. Sims, Mrs. S. M. Joy, who
was Mr. Towne's first school teacher; Dr.
D E Osborne of St. Helena, who was a
college chum of Mr. Towne at the Univer
sity of Michigan; Franklin K. Lane, and
Wakefield Baker.
The members of the party lingered at
dinner, and it was not until 8 o'clock that
they entered their carriages and were
driven to the California Hotel. There the
Iroquols Club had been waiting to lead
the parade to the Mechanics' Pavilion. As
soon aa possible the procession formed
and proceeded to Market street and thence
up Market to the Pavilion. There was
plenty of the blare of brass and the occa
sional sputter of fireworks, but the crowd
on the street was small and little enthusi
asm was occasioned by the passage of the
first parade of the Democratic campaign
In this city.
Five carriages held the party's guests
and prominent local Democrats. In the
first carriage were ex-CongTessman
Towne, Senator J. C. Sims, chairman of
the State Central Committee, M. F. Tar
pey and Franklin K. Lane.
The second carriage-load consisted of
Mrs. Towne, Mrs..S. M. Joy and ex-Con
gressman Camlnetti. In the third car
riage were Porter Ashe, J. H. Henry,
Judge Lawlor and D. M. Delmas. TV. H.
Alford, Thomas E. Curran, Frank S.
Drew and Seth Mann were In the fourth
carriage, and In the fifth were Al Mc-
Cabe and J. J. Kennedy.
The Iroquols Club, the Democratic Cen
tral Club, the Montlcello Club and a num
ber of district Bryan and Stevenson clubs
formed the body of the parade.
Will you San Francisco merchants, because
you can sell an army mule or bale of Ijay, vote
to continue this thing? is'o, my merchant
friend, what you want is the earliest possible
settlement of this upon a basis of peace and
amity. You want the commerce and trade of
the survivors of this people. You do not want
to kill the best of your customers and earn the
hatred of the rest. We are governing the Phil
ippines as our forefathers were governed by
Great Britain 125 years ago. when they fought
to overthrow that power. "When this country
fought for freedom It was a rebel against a
government. It is inconceivable that they
should fight to perpetuate the abuses which
they overthrew. â¢
, ' The President of the United States has over
stepped the constitution on at lean two occa
sions. In the peace protocol signed by this
country and Spain the United States was lim
ited to the city of Manila and Manila Bay.
yet one month before that protocol was passed
by the Senate McKinley ordered General Otis
to issue that proclamation taking control of
the entire archipelago and ordering tbe people
of those islands to accept such government as
he gave them or be shot to death.
â¢ The President' did right when he sent our
troops Into China to rescue our Minister. ' Our
Here the speaker related tales of massa
cre and what he was pleased to call tyr
anny in the Philippines. He held up blood
red pictures of. the brutalities of the
American soldier and the Republican ad
ministration. And then continuing said:
Along with the development of military gov
ernments in the world has gone colonial ambi
tion. We are already entering upon a dan
gerous phase of social declivity. History shows
that social decline has attended upon such con
ditions as wo face now. We have reached the
dancer point. One per cent of the people to
day own as much as- the other ninety-nine.
When such accumulation as this Is the result
of special privileges; when the money making
power has control of the law making machin
ery, then exist the conditions which have led
to disaster In other countries and. If the cor
rective be not applied, will lead to disaster in
the United States.
Having surrandered on the money question,
what can you expect of it in the Question of
the trusts? Let is be known that the Demo
cratic party Is not warring upon wealth as
wealth. Honest accumulation has no better
friend. But these men who are adding to
their wealth by Imposing upon the law are
sowing the wind and must some day reap the
whirlwind. They are banking up the water
so that some day it will rise upon them until
it bursts Its restraints and sweeps them and
their gains, together with honest accumula
tions, away forever.
Since the time of Abraham Lincoln that
party has fallen from Its high estate and those
high principles for which Lincoln stood at that
time. The party of Abraham Lincoln has
ceased to exist except in name only. So far
had it fallen and so false had it become that
in 1S96 many of us were compelled to forsake It.
Since this Government was formed there has
never '. been a slnple true polity. Up to now
It has been a contest between the few on one
side and the many on the other. Ever since
these articles of government were written and
later Included in the constitution 124 years
a~o It has been an effort on one side Â»o ke-Â»t*
true that fundamental proposition and on tfcÂ»
other side to defeat It.
We are not discussing now with particular
ity and care the main Issue at that time, but,
my friends, the man who fees In the making
of silver a full power money anything but the
orenln* of the mints does not understand the
Issue of 18D6.
speak to a San Francisco audience. I have ever
since that time retained the moit pleasant
recollection of my visit, and I return to-night
with emotions answerable to that feeling. My
friends, two and a half years ago it was my
duty to speak to you In regard to the dominant
Issue of the campaign of 1SÂ»Â«. Xeverthelees.
two years and a half ago, I addressed you In
regard to the campaign of 1900, for the cam
paign of 1S9S and the campaign of 1900 had and

thing. The campaign of 1900 may be nald In
every true sense to be the campaign of 1S96

In closing Mr. Towne dealt with the so
called treaty between this country and
the Sultan of Sulu. He pointed out that
two of the chief articles of the religion
of the Sultan are polygamy and the right
to hold slaves, and that over these two
evils, proscribed by the constitution and
laws of the United States, the President
had raised the American flag and agreed
to by treaty. Emphatically he declared
the treaty the most infamous document la
the archives of the United States. Mr.
Towne closed his remarkable oration Â¦with
a eulogy of the American flag that at last
brought the cheers from every throat in
the house, and brought them lustily.
"When he had finished the audience pave
him spontaneously three rousing cheers
and crowded round the rostrum to grasp

SCATTERING AUDIENCE IN 2&ECHANICS' PAVILION LISTENS WITH MARKED LACK OF ENTHUSIASM AND FEW OUTBURSTS OF APPLAUSE TO
EXPOSITION OF. DEMOCRATIC. PRINCIPLES AND ARRAIGNMENT OF REPUBLICAN POLICY BY CHARLES A. TOWNE AT THE FIRST RALLY
OF THE PARTY IN SAN FRANCISCO. ,
It is common report that W. H. Rick
ard, who was simply a boss chattel In the
last Legislature. Is slated for the nomi
nation in the Thirty-eighth District. In
the Thirty-ninth the indications are that
Ben McKinley will get the nomination
Frank Lewis and D. McBeth are spoken*
of. Hamilton Eauer in the Fortieth and
H. C. Dibble in the Forty-first have been
nominated. All the signs point to the
election of Bauer. In the Forty-third
District James D. Hart and Martin Bradv
are candidates, and each has six votes in
the delegation.- u
In the Thirty-fifth District E. F Tread
well and William Shepson are epoken ot
as candidates. :
DEMOCRATS FIXING A SLATE
Majority of the Nominations for the
Legislature Are Already De
cided Upon.
The majority of the Democratic legis
lative nominations are alreadv elated, but
Adam Eeck, F. V. Cox and S. E. Knight
are looking for As^mbly recognition in
the Thirty-fourth District Alpheua
Duffee will probably get the nomination
in the Thirty-sixth, although O. H. Mer
rill is mentioned. Arthur G. FIsk and W.
J. Toung are in the field of the Thirty
seventh District.
The indications are that Charles R.
Franklin will be nominated for the As
sembly in the Twenty-eighth District.
Jerry Collins is slated for the nomination
in the Twenty-ninth. Henry Burns is a
candidate iu the Thirty-first District.
The Twenty-fifth Senatorial District
embraces the Forty-fourth and Forty
fifth Assembly districts. The Senatorial
district elected John Feeney, a Democrat,
four years ago. The Republicans have
been losers in the district for many years
for no other cause t^ian factional fights.
Lost nleht John H. Kelson was nomi
nate.
The Twenty-third Senatorial District
embraces the Thirty-first and Thirty
ninth Assembly districts. For the past
four years the people of the district have
been represented by Sidney Hall. Candi
dates for the nomination are John J.
Tyrrell, Edward Xolan and James Wilk
inson.
The Twenty-first Senatorial District
embraces the .Thirty-seventh and Thirty
eighth Assembly districts. Four years
ago E. I. Wolfe was elected to represent
the people of the district in the State
Senate, but he preferred to serve the cor
porations and the bosses. He is a candi
date for renominatlon. Other candidates
are Frank Grimes, ex-Governor E. S.
Salomon and James E. Fields.
The Tenth Senatorial District embrace*
Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth Assem
bly districts. I_ J. Dwyer, a Democrat,
represented the district in the State Sen
ate for the past four years. The indica
tions are that Merton C. Allen will be
nominated on the Republican ticket to
succeed Dwyer. Ex-Senator Thomas C.
Maher, however, has a strong following.
The Seventeenth Senatorial District,
which was misrepresented in the last
Legislature by S. Braunhart, embraces
the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth As
sembly district-s. Martin Kelly began his
active political career in that district aa
a Democrat under Buckley's orders. Sub
sequently he served under the famed Re
publican boss, William Higgins. Dibble,
who is now serving under Kelly, received
hfs first training in Louisiana, Bogus
Tek-gram Lynch* who is now a Kelly un
derstudy, got his first lessons in San Ber
nardino County. It is said that Kelly has
decided to give the Senatorial nomination
in that district to William Daly. The
story goes that E. J. Smith can have
the nomination for the asking, but has no
desire to go to the Legislature. Charles
Kenneally and John Dougherty are on the
available list.
P"or Justices of the Peace Groezlnger
ana Dunn, incumbents, and P. V. Long
are flated. R. E. H. Lyons and Frank
Kingwell are fighting hard for one of the
other places, with the chances and the
boFÂ«=es favoring Lyons.
cancics and that Judge Bahrs will likely
fall in for another. Judge Belcher and
D. J. Murphy are not out of the race by
any means, and one or the other may
develop sufficient strength to win before
the battle is finished. In fact the renom
ination of Judge Belcher is predicted by
the insiders.

A, Ruef gained a complete victory over
the Kelly and Crlmmins faction in the
legislative contest In the Twenty-fifth
Senatorial DiEtrict at the convention held
last night. The three candidates selected

Collector'3 office, secured the nomination
for Senator and Alexander Campbell Jr.
and A. Brown were given the nomination
for Assemblymen for the Forty-fourth and
Forty-fifth districts respectively.

pledged to Ruef. Sufficient of the jump
ers were brought back, however, to secure
the plums for Ruefs men by a single
vote.
R. H. Jones was Nelson's opponent.

The high-class greyhounds entered in
the Union Park open stake were given a
hard day's work In the hot sun yesterday
chasing the well-fed and healthy Merced
hares. The weather was suitable to the
jacks, and in conseauence the average
scores got up in the double figures. j
The day's feature was the winning- of
Geary's great courser, Palo Alto, who
showed speed enough to satisfy the wise
ones that, barring accident, thero is noth
ing In the stake to stop him on the road
to first money. In the course with the
Pasha Kennels* Random Aim, Palo Alto
took the lead and when the flag was
raised had piled up six points without let
ting his opponent score.
Whitehead and Mayflower showed up in
great form, and if condition counts either
is likely to contest with Palo Alto for
final honors. Sacramento Boy took an
easy course from Curtis & Sons 1 Cash in
the early oart of the stake, and Is well
favored for^a position near the big end of
the purse. ,
Added to the natural advantages pos
sessed by these fast ones the work done
by them in the run down was of the short
order and will not handicap them in the
running to-day.
Short ends made a fair showing 1 and
Sf'w'^v'" averaee good odds.
The best of the bunch waa that of The
Exile against Risky Attempt. Ten to 1
and better could be had against the win

lily of the West. Fallon's many-time
stake winner, put up a pood course
against Night Time, beating him point
less. This is her first time out In some
months and from lack of work she seems
hardly abie to go the long route.
O'Shea Bros." Golden Rule showed a
vast improvement over her last going,
and with her kannelmate. Young America,
stands a chance to reach the last rounds.
Connemara is also a likely candidate.
Flora McDonald put up a speedy go
with Best Bargain, but is a trifle over
weight, which fact might tell against her.
Considering the comparatively easy
work of yesterday and that the best dogs
are still fn the stake, to-day's programme
should furnish many clever goes. The
dogs are so evenly matched throughout
that the talent will find it hard to pick
the winners and figure prices. Â¦

Reliance Team Wnis.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 22.â The football game
at Cyclers' Park to-day between the Reli
ance of San Francisco ;and Santa Clara
College teams was won by the former by
a score of 17 to 6â three touchdowns for
Reliance and one for Santa Clara The
day was too hot for lively playing.
Lowell High School of this city had a
number of entries in the field day, but
only Barkan put In an appearance. That
youngster by fast traveling in the sprint3
netted six points for his school. "Midget"
Westdahl essayed the mile run, but could
only gain second place to Clough. The
lad had fatigued himself in his long run
an hour before and did not do himself
justice. Although tired and suffering
from pains in his chest, he finished the
race and gathered three more points for
his school. â
Oakland High School captured nine
firsts, seven seconds and three thirds.
Berkeley High School gained seven firsts,
four seconds and eight thirds. Lowell
landed second and Central High captured
a second place and two third places. The
winners of the various events follow:
Abbreviationsâ O. H. 8., Oakland High
School; L. H. S.. Lowell High School; B. H. S..
Berkeley High School; C. H. 8.. Central High.
School; C. S. M. A., California School cf
Mechanical Arts.
The pole vault was long drawn out and
the event was only won by Miranda of
Oakland by a narrow margin. The pole
Â¦was raised to 9 feet 6 inches, which Is half
a foot over the record made by Volz last
year.
The Oakland relay team was made up
of Hughes,. Cloughl Norton, Jordan, Met
calf and Smiley. ' Berkeley was repre
sented by Grlndley, Finn, Needham, Am
brose, Hawley and Nelson.
The relay race produced more excite
ment than all the field and track events
combined. Oakland won the race by a nar
row margin in exceedingly fast time. Had
Berkeley possessed more fast sprinters
like Ambrose and Elmer Kelson they
would have won the day. Nelson was a
host in himself. He cut down the lead of
the Oakland lads and finished so fast that
the race been prolonged he undoubt
edly would have beaten Smiley.
There was a good attendance at the
games and the climatic conditions were
Ideal for a field day. Both Berkeley and
Oakland turned out a large band of root
ers, who, under the leadership of loud
voiced young men, yelled and encouraged
their representatives on to victory. Pret
ty girls beribboned in blue, the colors of
the Athenian city High School team, and
the red and yellow colors of the Berkeley
contingent waved in the soft breezes that
fanned the young athletes who strove for
victory. Â«
day at Berkeley the score show
ed the young athletes from the Athe
nian city to be the victors. The Oakland
lads were' nearly Invincible In the track
events and were evenly matched with the
Berkeley boys in the field trials. Only
one record was broken during the day,
and that was the one prophesied In The
Call of yesterday. "Midget" Westdahl
romped away from his field In the two
mile run, and making his own pace re
duced his record for the distance by more
than a minute. His time, 10:52. compares
favorably with the records of many col
lege athletes.

AT the close of the semi-annual
field day of the Bay County Ath
letic League, which Is composed
of the foregoing schools, yester-
followed. Backed from 8 to 5 to evens, he
met with a variety of hard luck, getting
to the wire a length behind Pilot. The
latter, ridden by J. Woods and 4 to 1, was
never headed. Trevathan got caught in
the barrier at the start, finishing a fair
third. Good Hope had a big following,
but her work didn't warrant the support.
Another cherry ripe one to go by the
board was Merry Boy, a 1 to 2 chance for
the mile soiling affair. Second most of the
route to Homestake, the chestnut finally,
fell easy prey to Alturas. The winner â
f-econd choiceâ had been extensively tout
ed, so his victory did not benefit the books,
Jennie Reid cut no figure, packing too
much weight.
In the jilnal six furlong speed recital
Stuart, with the leg up on Flush of Gold,
endeavored to rough ride J. Walsh on the
favorite, Mocorito. The last named mare
came home with something' in reserve, and
the judges fined Stuart $20 for his clever
ness. Novla finished a distant third. Sum

Oakland 4, Sacramento 0.
Oakland beat the champions yesterday
at Recreation Parkâ shut them out. In
factâ and that Is why the "beer brigade"
celebrated with foaming yellow. Then the
weather was hot and the beer cool. At
the end of the ninth Inning there was
more critical baseball wisdom cast to the
winds that did not blow than would op
erate three rival leagues.
"Nothin" .doin,' " shouted the leader of
the "beer brigade." He had Just paid 25
cents for his seat and was cashing In the
exchange check for much flowing ma.lt
thickly capped with froth. "I tell yer, the
Dudes will win this in a walk. Easy
money,"
The first Inning brought nothing but
ciphers for both teams. Then the only
Jay Hughes was pounced upon by the
Dudes and swatted three times.
"O ho, and six bottles of rum," came
from the brigadier beer consumer. "Will
yer look at Arrellanes skating round those
sacks on a double. And Masky bunts to
Hughes. Oh, get some mucilage for your
fists, Hughes. Well, wouldn't that jar
you? Held gets a hit and Arrellanes steps
all over the rubber. Even Bowman can
work the bunt game just right. Why,
they re all safe. Great Caesar's ghostâ
Mangerina gets a single and Held smears
himself on the plate. Too easy, too easy."
When Hardle flew to center and Bow
man scored the brigadier collapsed.
Three hits off Hughes In a single inning!
Well, I gruess we'll alt have a small one
on that," he said, and they didâ several
of them.
From the second until the seventh the
brigadier smiled and sipped and was in
termittently silent. But here he Â£roke
out In every spot. Drennan sewed up one
of Hughes' straight balls somewhere near
the end of the left field bleachers. A
home run was the result. All through the
next two innings the beer came from the
bar like a Galveston storm.; "What's the
use of fighting about It?" said the leader
of the yellow drinkers. "They can't touch
Mosky. You wait. Some day we'll be
'champs.' Maybe next year." The score.*

TOO MUCH NEED
OF EXTRA STUDY
Parents Say That tha Pupil
Is Overburdened .With
Lessons.
Superintendent McClymonds Insists
That Careful Investigation Dis
closes No Good Ground
for Criticism.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111& Broadway, Sept, 22.
Complaints made to the Superintendent
of Schools that public school pupils are
being subjected to overdiaicuit extra work
at home have been the subject .of a close
investigation by Superintendent J. W. Mc-
Clymonds. Ho has completed his inquiry
and now makes public the declaration
that the criticism of parents is unfounded
ana that the rules of the department with
â¢relation to home study are being obeyed.
The â¢ Superintendent says tne reports
from all of the schools in the city show
that the average time consumed in home
work is trom a half to tnree-quarters of
an hour, while two hours a day is allowed
in the school for silent study.
In an interview upon the subject Super
intendent McClymonds said to-day:
**I have made a thorough examination
of all the reports on home work assign
ments which have come in from the
schools of the city and lind tliat in no case
are pupils being overworked or deprived
of time to study in school hours. No
home study Is required of a pupil in our
schools until he has completed his fifth
year of work. Teachers in the grammar
schools must conduct their recitations so
that each child can study in its school
room at least two full hours, or two
fifths of the time spent in school. When
homework is assigned it must be of such
character that the child can master it
without any help from the parents. One
of the rules of the department is that
grammar grade teachers on the assign
ment of a lesson must call the attention
of the pupils to the important points and
explain any new principle involved. The
reports I have received show that this
rule is being carried out.
"In spite of all the care we can give to
the regulation of home work, there are
many criticisms from parents. At the
bottom of all the trouble Is the fact that
the parents who have grievances are un
willing that their children should take
longer than the regular time to complete
their course, no matter how" necessary
such extension of time may be for them.
It is impossible to tix a standard of work
that will suit all pupils. There are too
many differences of mental and physical
capacity. But parents with grievances
always want a whole class delayed for
their child.
"On the. other hand, my experience leads
me to believe that over-zealousness on
the part of parents la sometimes the cause
of a thoroughly capable child overwork
ing himself. It is also unfortunately true
that the pupil who is so constituted as to
be unable to stand the strain of home
study is invariably the one who persists
in that kind of work.
"The policy of the Oakland School De
partment Is to avoid any possibility of
cramming. Parents whose children nave
come here from San Francisco schools
have told me that the home work Is much
lighter than that given across the bay.
"W e want to avoid burdening the child's
memory and try to give him Instead abil
ity to do work and to do it with content
ment."
OAKLAND, Sept. 22.â Isaac Fiel. who
up to a few days ago conducted a Jewelry
and notion counter in the department
store of Salinger Bros, at Eleventh and
Washington streets, Â¦ filed suit to-day
against A. M. and M. Salinger for $6000
damages, which he claims he sustained
because of their alleged violation of a
lease held by him of quarters in the
Salinger store. Fiel alleges that he was
to have the exclusive privilege of selling
jewelry and leather goods, but that-Sal
inger Bros., taking advantage of his suc
cess, opened an opposition stall and sold
the same goods at a price below cost, thus
compelling him to operate at a great loss.
The plaintiff also claims that instead of
being given sixty days' notice to leave
the premises, as agreed upon when the
lease was made, he was allowed but ten
days in which to get out.
Salinger Bros., the defendants, 'give an
altogether different version of the diffi
culty. According to the merchants Fiel
was ordered from their store because he
did not deal honestly with them, but used
their name Jn buying goods in order that
he might establish a credit with the large
San Francisco mercantile houses. It was
his scheme, they say, to go across the bay
and buy up goods, have them shipped to
Oakland in the name of Salinger Bros,
and pay when he could. Fearing the loss
of their credit by such procedure, so they
assert, Salinger Bros, put a stop to it by
ordering Fiel from the store.
The brothers deny that he was only
given ten days' notice to leave, but assert
that he was told to go several months ago.
The defendants claim that Fiel injured
their business because he attempted to
dispose of inferior goods over his counter.
Isaac Fiel Claims He Suffered Six
Thousand Dollars' Damages
From Former Landlords.

"After Captain Allen had charred mÂ«

"I spoke to the commandant about It. Ha
said that captains should not be allowed
to again enter the office with protests and
that Allen's conduct would militate
against him when coming up for appoint
ment as major. So far as I am concerned
nothing more will be done. I hope no
action will be taken against Captain Al
len. I have filed no charges against him
and will not do so."
"It was merely a personal row bet'ween
Adjutant Curtiss and myself," was Cap
tain Allen's explanation. "I told him his
recommendations for appointments had
been unfair. It has been customary for
captains to recommend the men who pas9

tunity to do so."

case of Cadet E. Rowland, who was mado

tain Allen's opinion that Rowland should
have been given the single bars of a first
lieutenant.
Allen also very vehemently declared
that there were other captains who had a
similar grievance against Curtiss. but he
Â¦would not specify who these disgruntled
officers were.
There was a glimpse of white-gloved
hands waving in the air and bits of ex

as the two officers aired their differences.
And it reached the ears of Captain Henry
Waite, U. S. A., commandant at the uni

ST7ES FOR rNSTJUANCE
ON . HER BURNED HOME
Aftermath, of One of the Mysterious
Fixes Which Alarmed Pleas
ant Valley Residents.
OAKLAND, Sept. 22.â As the aftermath
of one of the mysterious fires which ter
rorized the residents of Piedmont and
Pleasant Valley last February, Mrs. Au
gusta Lund to-day commenced suit
against the Franklin Fire Insurance Com
pany for $2100. Mrs. Lund claims that her
house, which was burned to the ground
February 23, was insured in the Franklin
Company for that amount, but that the
officials of the corporation refuse to pay
her mere than $1500.
According to the complainant, she has
applied for the full amount of the insur
ance and furnished absolute proof of the
total destruction of her house and its
contents. She alleges that the house was
Insured for $1500 and that there were two
policies of $200 and $400 on the furniture.
The Lund residence was discovered in
flames about midnight on February 23,
and being outside the city, with no water
available, was burned to the ground. The
cause of the blaze was never learned.

HAPPENINGS
ALAMEDA. Sept 22.â The Republicans
of this city have started a demand for
harmony in the County Committee. The
first step toward an expression from
members of the party concerning the
split in the governing body of the party
organization has been made by the Ala
meda Republican Club, which has
adopted resolutions urging an amicable
settlement of the differences which have
disrupted the organization.
These resolutions are as follows:
Alameda Republican Club. Alameda. Sept. 22,
1S00.
Resolved, That the executive committee of
the Alameda Republican Club deprecates the
position assumed by the gentlemen chosen to
serve as county commltteemen, in not effecting
an amicable organization, and thus being able
to properly conduct the affairs of the Republi
can party during: the present campaign.
The best interests of the party demand that
the committee f hould at once get together and
proceed to the work for which they have been,
elected. The longer the present deplorable con
dition exists the more the party is being In
jured, and we most respectfully Insist that all
personal fe^IinRs be laid aside and the vital
Interests of the Republican party alon^ con
sidered.
F. E. BROWNING, Secretary
The foregoing resolution was unanlmously
adoptod at a meeting of the executive commit
t*e of the Alameda republican Club, repre
senting a membership of 833.
J. C. BATES JR., Chairman.
A copy of the resolution will be sent to
every tnember of the Republican County
Committee. An effort was made for a
conference to-day between the Breed com
mitteemen and the Lanktree-Nusbaumer
nine, but the meeting was necessarily pre
vented bv the absence of Chairman A. H.
Breed from Oakland. So far as present
indications are concerned neither side has
manifested any desire to yield a point.
Unless there bhall be some compromise.
It is verv probable that the Republican
State Central Committee will take charge
of the national campaign in Alameda
County. There is nothing at stake at
present to warrant the fight that is on in
the committee. The battle, of which this
Is a mere skirmish, is to come with the
State and county election two years
hence. The Breed wing is most anxious to
retain control of the committee for that
campaign. The next regular meeting of
the Breed committee is called for Septem
ber 25.

SHOULD BE EXTENDED
Commissioner of Works Mendell Ad
vises Full Control of Proposed
Improvement by State. -
The Mayor received a communication
yesterday from President Mendell of the
Board of Public Works In which the lat
ter recommends that provision be made
for the full control by "the State of the
seawall to be constructed by the Santa
Fe Railroad in front of China Basin. Mr.
Mendell says:
I understand that while the proposed agree
ment with the Santa Fa Railroad provides that
under certain conditions the public shall have
use of a street ICO feet wide along the bay
front of China Basin the public may have the
whole width of 200 feet, provided the State
build a section of the seawall 1000 feet In length
In southerly continuation of the wall to be
built In front of China Basin. The estimated
cost of this section is $150,000, the yearly inter
est upon which will be !500a
In view of the large and obscure possibilities
of the next fifty years, both as may relate to
development of commercial interests and in
conveniences and embarrassments due to want
of full control of the seawall by. the Harbor
Commissioners and the city the Insignificance;
of $5000 per year relative to possible embarrass
ments is apparent. .

Three-year-old Willie Lennefelt was
produced in court this morning before
Judge Ellsworth on a writ of habeas cor
pus issued several days ago" at the In
stance of the father. William C. Lenne
felt, who declared that his wife had spir
ited the child away and refused to allow
him to visit him. Mrs. Lennefelt had the
boy in court.
Though but a few minutes was devoted
to the hearing of the writ and the matter
was postponed until next Tuesday for
final decision, much of the family history
of the Lennefelts was aired in court. It
developed that for some months the rela
tions of the couple have been far from
happy, and that violent quarrels were
frequent. Some time ago Lennefelt and
his wife separated, she going to reside
with her parents. Mr. and Mrs. Shannon
of 1205 Twenty-third avenue. The child
was taken by the mother. Lennefelt then
sued for a divorce, but his petition was
denied on the ground of insufficiency of
evidence.
Lennefelt stated that he made a num
ber of attempts to see his child, but that
his wife always refused him entrance to
the house, and that her father went so
far as to threaten his life if he ventured
near his home again. Since that time
Lennefelt has kept away from the Shan
non residence, fearing, he asserted, that
his irate father-in-law might carry out
his threat.
When the case was called this morning
Attorney Custer asked permission from
the court for Lennefelt to visit the child
pending the hp.beas corpus proceedings.
Judge Ellsworth replied that unless some
good reason to the contrary could be
shown he did not see. why the father
should be kept away from his child.
"Mrs. Lennefelt is in mortal fear of this
man," interrupted Attorney Holman. "He
has threatened to kidnap the child and
she is afraid that he will carry his threat
into execution."
In reply to Holman, Lennefelt's counsel
said he would guarantee to the court that
Lennefelt would conduct himself properly
If allowed to visit the child, and would
make no attempt to take the boy from
the custody of hia mother.
"I will. If it is desired," said Custer,
"place Mr. Lennefelt on the stand to tes
tify that his wife's father, Mr. Shannon,
threatened to kill him if he ever came to
the Shannon home again."
Attorney Holman promised the court
that Lennefelt would be allowed to visit
the boy without molestation from his
wife's parents, and Judge Ellsworth
granted the father permission to visit his
child this afternoon. The further hear
ing of the case was continued until next
Tuesday.
Before leaving the courtroom Lennefelt
walked over to where his wife held their
child and hugged and kissed the- boy.

"The shirt waist is the proper thing when

crusade against coats and vests. The only
obstacle I had to overcome was my pecu

poet-wit. During the war Saxe attended
a flag-raising at Greenbush. a little place
across the river from Albany, and made
a ppeech, in which he commended the
patriotism of the young men of Green
bush, through whose exertions the fiasr
had beerr procured. The cnalrman of the
meeting whispered to him that the young
ladies of Greenbush had also been Instru
mental in raising funds for the purchase
of the flag. Thereupon Saxe, addressing
the young ladles of Greenbush. made
them a graceful and gallant apology for
not including them ln his praise. "I don't
know how I came to make such a mis
take," he explained, "save as I may have
been laboring under the Impression that
tha young men of Greenbush embraced

IT occurred to me the other evening at
a charming song recital to wonder
how many among the audience were
even partially cognizant of all the
various kinds of effort that go to
make the success of such an affair. Not
to consider all that has necessarily gone
before the first step upon the platform;
from the laborious development of In
herent aptitude to the final attractive ad
vertisement of one's wares In the public
market in order to obtain a hearing, but
the wretched problems of how to stand,
8t walk; what t> do with hands and feet,
rno'uth and eyes, when, the dread moment
comes to proclaim one's rlrtt to appear
ance on a platform. It is only thefortu
nate exception to whom the platform pre
sents Itself aa a comfortable environment,
Â»nd to whom the fascinating and indis
pensable courtesies of the artist etiquette
naturally suggest themselves, ease and
Krace of manner being almost Invariably
the result of long cultivation. And an
audience is a capricious and coquettish
entity, sensitively alive to the suggestion
of a charming manner, and always. If
sometimes unconsciously, resentful of its
absence It seems. Indeed, that the said
charm of manner has perhaps an unfair
advantage in the public summing up of an
artist's worth, but the tendency Is one to
be reckoned with and that may not bo
There' is, it has been observed, a quite
rigid etiquette concerning the relations of
artist and audience, with a large scope
for originality ln the manner of Its ob
servance, and did space permit one could
fill the page with a dissertation upon fa
miliar Instances of originality In this di
rection. It's a fascinating subject, too.
Why does not some one write tho "Com
plete Platformer," with illustrations of
now to pick up a bunch of violets ln dead
rat fashion, a la Paderewski? â or how to
be Interesting though Byronlc, a la Dam
rosch? â or how to play the piano in the
Intervals of criticizing the audience, a la
Pachmann?â or how to be charming and
an artist, like Miss Anna Miller Wood?â
for it was at Mlas Wood's recital on.
Thursday evening last at Sherman-Clay
Hall that the subject suggested itself
to me.
This charming Callfornian has done
much good work elnce her departure from
the State five years ago. ... Sne was -well
and favorably known before leaving here,
and since then has studied to great ad
vantage with Georg Henschel of England,
whose delightful method aroused' the
highest admiration on his appearance here
a couple of years ago. Since MIsb Wood's
return to America she has been domiciled
in Boston, where she holds a prominent
church position and also spends some time
ln teaching. She has repeatedly appeared

Miss Wood has a delightful voice, round
full clear as a bell and of the true con
tralto quality, with an exceptionally ex
tended compass. There Is some little lack
of color perhaps, In the middle voice, but
the beauty of her upper tones and some of
those of the lower register is rarely satis
fying. Her repertoire is varied, and her
Interpretations thoroughly artistic. A trio
of Foote songs that Miss Wood gave on

"It didn't turn out as Jones figured,
said the talkative man, with a grin. Â«e
invited me to pay him a visit at his sum
mer home In the country, and I accepted
without any idea of what he had in store
for me. No sooner had I arrived than ne
informed me that he had me booked to
act as judge of a baby show that was
to take place the following day. I laugh
ed at him and told him that all babies
looked alike to me. and that I would have
to be excused. But he PÂ°i?ted out the
fact that I had been advertised to act.
and that it was now too late to withdraw,
so I consented, although with a good
many misgivings concerning the outcome.
Had I known at tne time that t was one
of his jokes to get me in trouble Im

for his benefit. Â¦ , . # __
"Well, when I stood up on the platform
and saw twenty-seven proud mothers
holding as many babies before me I came
near losing my nerve and bolting. How
ever, I took a brace and told them to
form in line and march past me. They
did, and the sight made me dizzy, and
for the life of me I couldn't tell a white
baby from a colored one. To catch my
breath and gain time to collect my
thoughts I told them to march around
once more, the result being that I was
more rattled than before. I was about
to ask them to parade once more when I
saw Jones grinning at me from the rear
of the hall, and I realized the hand that
he had had in getting me Into the
present situation. L4ke a flash I saw a
way' out of the trouble and a chance to
even up matters with Jones at the same
time. Clearing my throat. I addressed
the expectant mothers as folows:
11 'I have asked you to pass before me
more as a miittpr cf form than from any
doubt concerning the winner of this con
test That the babies are all dears I
think you will agree with me. and I also
think "you wiH concur In my judgment
when I state that there Is one baby here
so much prettier than the rest as to place
it in a cla-os of its own. and to that baby
it is my duty to award the prize. But
to save the heartburnings of the other
mothers I think it best not to publicly
announce the winner at this time. If
the mother who holds the winner at this
instant in her arms â and she knows to
whom I referâ will call at tho home of
Mr. Jones to-morrow morning at S o'clock
she will be awarded the prize that she
so justly deserves.'
"Then I lfft and caught the first train
from home. I gather from the somewhat
warm and Incoherent remarks that Jones
has made In my hearing since that there
was a wildly exciting time when twenty
seven fond "mothers called in a bunch to
demand the prize that I had awarded.

he appears afraid to go back I rather
imagine that the end is not yet."â Detroit

that the baggage, costumes, ncenery and

at that port of entry by the United States
Custom-house officials. A bond, guaran
teeing that everything shall be sent out of
the country at the expiration of the en
gagement, was immediately prepaid and
forwarded, but the delay arising necessi
tates a postponement of the opening until
Wednesday night, when "Otello" will be
sung. "Carmen" will be the bill Thurs
day night, "Aida" will be given Friday
and Sunday. "La Traviata" will be heard
at the Saturday matinee and "Otello"
will be repeated Saturday night. Thirty
eight people come with the organization
and they will be reinforced in this city
with a carefully rehearsed chorus of forty.
Persons who have purchased seats for
to-night. Monday or Tuesday may ex

be refunded.

An interesting recital was that given by
Miss Grace Barker Marshall, pianist, and
Cert Georges, basso, at Sherman & Clay's
Hall on Tuesday evening last. .The hall
was crowded to its utmost capacity by
the friends of the young people, who were
most enthusiastic in their reception of the
work of the musicians. .?ââÂ«,
Miss Marshall Is a young pianist pos
sessing many natural advantages, not the
least of which Is a charming stage pres
ence, but she has yet much to learnâ Â«nd
unlearn-of her chosen instrument. That
she possesses temperament is undoubted,
and a certain amount of technical facility,
though not of the higher kind which in
cludes tone-production: but her style is
flippant and calculated to exhibit, in Its
chopped-off phrases and complete lack of
the singing quality of tone, the most Par
ing defects of her instrument. That it is
largelv a technical lack I am persuaded
and Miss Marshall is young enough and
musical enough, with good tra n ing and
effort, very soon to repair this deficiency
Mr Georges, who will shortly go East
to study, has a good bass voice, of fine
compass and exceptional quality. His
school is artistic, and the ''Prologue'
from "Pagliacci" was rendered with fine
breadth and dramatic appreciation. \V e
shall undoubtedly hear more of Mr.
Georges in the not too distant future.
Samuel Savannah and Arthur Ficken
sher, who assisted the young musicians,
nlayed the first movement of the Or ilaj.
Sonata of Rubinstein, and Miss Estelle
Brinn accompanied the "Pagliacci pro
logue in very effective fashion.
An Infer* sting piano recital was given
on Monday evening last by Miss Marlon
Beai at Sherman-Clay Hall* The young
lady was a pupil of Dr. Jedliczka of Ber
lin foi four years and shows an admirable
school. Her octave an3 staccato work is
particularly good, and while her interpre
tations lack climax and repose they ha\e
a certain picturesque quality.
It is probable if the forthcoming sym
phony concert at the Tivoll Opera-house
under the direction of Max HIrschfeld
is a success that a symphony series under
the same director will be attempted. It
is to be remembered that the successful
symphony seasons under Adolpn Bauer
and Fritz Scheel were inaugurated in the
popular little theater, and that Mr.
Hl'schfeld's good work with the Tlvoll
orchestra perhaps points him out as the
most capable conductor it present among
U3 â .
"The Symphonie Fantastique," an epi
sode in the life of an artist, which will
be given for the first time in ssan I- r.in
clsco. is an extraordinary and nlrnpst
terrifying musical conception. In which
Berlioz embodies the dreams of an opium
fiend. I heard It given by the Sir Charles
Halle orchestra in England, and should
certainly accord it first place in the cata
logue of the bizarre and terrible In muMe
Many women wept and men shuddered

Another very Interesting musical affair
of the week was the grand concert given
on Friday evening by Miss Rose Adler
Relda of the Opera Comique. Paris. As is
generally known. Miss Relda is also a
California girl, a former pupil of Miss
Marie Withrow, and in Paris of Mme.
Colonne. A large audience greeted the
clever songstress in spite of the over
whelming heat, and received most enthu
siastically the numbers on her notable
programme. Miss Relda's voice has
gained conspicuously In power since she
was last heard here four years ago, and
she has. a facile and certain technique.
The favorite "Shadow Dance," despair of

comparison with its lightness; and in the
"Bell Song" from "Lakme" the artist
gave us a taste of her dramatic quality.

Both Golden Gate and Volunteer Coun

councils have arranged for a grand enter
tainment, to be given at no distant date.
This order, which originated in this
city, is showing an increase which is
gratifying to the grand officers. The
financial report for August is said to be
the best in the history of the order. For
some time past the order has instituted
an average of five councils a month. At
the recent session of the Fraternal Con
gress, held in Boston, Mass., the order
was admitted to membership. This
means, say the officers, that the order has
stood tho test of the leading: fraternal
men of the country and has been ap
proved by them. The order has for a long
time worked to attain that end.

Titmalpais Camp has been making re
markable headway of late, and if it keeps
up the paco it will make some of the
large camps look to their crowns. From
an almost insignificant camp a few
months ngo it has risen to third place,
and its organizer says that by the close
of the year it will stand second. The
camp has a srood organizer and mnny
good workers who are doing all they can
to bring the camp into prominence. Laii
rance Vincent, a very active member,
says that while it is true that the Golden
Gate Is very prominent. Tamalpals over
tops the Golden Gate, and that if No. fi4
is not careful the camp he belongs to will
boar the same relation to Golden Gate
Camp that the mountain does to the his
toric entrance to our bay. This camp will
give its night at home on the last Thurs
day nf the month. Some time during the
month of October the members of Tamal
pais Camp will go on a trolley ride and

The word canard does not only mean tha
water fowl beloved by gourmets; it also
signifies a little lump of sugar dipped In
brandy and often taken by the fair sex
with their after-dinner coffee. Journal
istically it implies a bit of pseudo news
which owes more to the imagination than
to the sen?e of veracity of the author.
The accounts of the distortion of the
original sense of the word into its jour
nalistic meanings are many. One thine
is. however, certain. Three centuries and

"American oars are made in twenty or
twenty-tive factories, situated principally
in the Western States east of the Mis
sissippi River, where large forests furnish
the best timber for their manufacture.
Oars are made almost wholly by machin
ery, only a small amount of handwork
being done in finishing them. There are
three varieties of woods used in making
oars. Those intended for working pur
poses are made of ash and oak In lensrths
varying from six to twenty-four feet,
"Very few people, except, perhaps, pro
fessional and amateur boatmen, are aware
that American-made oars are the finest
in the world," said a leading wholesale
dealer In oars in New York to a Star
writer recently. "At home and abroad,
wherever there Is water and small boats
are used, our oars are celebrated for their
lightness, strength, durability and beauty
of finish, and as many as 600,000 pairs, or
about 6.000.000 feet of oars, are manufac
tured In this country every year. Xearly
two-thirds of the product is sold to boat
men and fishermen living on the borders
of the great lakes and sea coast towns
and cities of the United States, and the
rest is exported to England, Germany,
Russia, France, Italy and Scotland. In
all of these countries' the superior quali
ties of our oars are, among oarsmen, free
ly acknowledged, and in many of the for
eign navies they are so highly esteemed
that they are either largely or exclusively
used. For instance, 6$00 plece3, or all
the oars used on British war vessels, are
purchased in this country. The next
largest foreign buyers of our oara are
the French and Italian governments, each
of which has a standing order with a New
York dealer to supply Its navy with 5200
pieces annually.

Charles Dickens' Present- *%
Charles Dickens was always very fond
of children. One day he was walking in
the neighborhood of Gad's Hill, not long
after he had acquired his property there,
when he suddenly ran into a little girl
wheeling a doll's perambulator. In an in
stant the tiny vehicle was upset, the dolls
being thrown out.
It was a bad accident as far as they
were concerned, for wax heads and limbs
are not calculated to stand much hard
usage. The little maid burst into tears,
and, much to the novelist's sorrow, re
fused to be comforted.
"Then come home with me," Dickens
whispered, soothingly, "and we'll see if
we can't find some grand waxen lady in
silks and satins for you."
So back to the big house the two went,
and, sure enough, up In his children's
nursery he managed to discover a few
prettily dressed dolls. With these safely
tucked In her perambulator the little girl
trotted off.
' But It Is in the seqvel that the best part
of the story lies. The child's heart was
Bet on making some return for this.kind
ness, so her parents, who had not the
faintest suspicion of her friend's person
ality, took her to town to choose some
thing. Her choice fell eventually upon a
gorgeously bound book.
When Dickens the next day undid thÂ«
parcel his 'small visitor brought him he
was surprised and delighted to see a copy
of "David Copperfleld."
Not until many years later, when they
met again in society, did the little girl
learn who the "kind gentleman" was. â

clseo. In consequence New York bankers hav*
been large lenders in foreign markets and for
a considerable period have bten practicalij
out of the local market. Interior markets In
thÂ«. meantime have been placing loans In ths
New York market. The effect of these con
ditions, which have been ripening for a long
time, became manifest last week, when de
mands were made upon New York banks' re
serves for currency for Interior points. ThÂ»
nopÂ« that the Galveston relief measures might
be ;*es than last week's movement, which was
abnormal, was dissipated by this week's
larger movement demands from West
ern points b^ing added to those from '
tho South. New York money rated '
h*vo risen appreciably In response and I
sreculatlve sentiment in the stock market has
been much more sensitive to elements of un
certainty in the outlook. The coal miners'
strike, the unsettled wage schedules In the
steÂ«l trades and the growing complexity of the
diplomatic situation over China have proved
parts of increasing importance. It is recalled
that In the experience of last fall, the .needs
cf speculative holders of stocks were the last
to be consulted by tenders of money, and mahy
Industrial dividend paying stocks were uncom
rromlslnsly rejected as collateral for loans.
The call loan rate on the Stock Exchange
soared to 1.S6 per cent, while no more than 6
ror c*nt was paid for loans In ordinary busi
ness transactions. These are considerations
that have Induced the week's liquidation.
Tho bond market has been only slightly af
fected as compared with stocks, but liquida
tion has been In evidence there also. New 4s
coupon advanced H and the old 4s U per cent
In the bid price. The 3s declined M per cent.

New York Grain and Produce.
NEW YORK. Sept. 22. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London finarfclal cablegram says:
The markets here were absolutely stagnant to
day. There was no news and no business.
American shares dropped, but their weakness
teemed to be due solely to the utter lack of
support. Copper sharea were irregular. Money
rates were very stiff, closing at 3U per cent
for call loan?. 3% per cent for lime loans and
discounts 4 per cent.
Gold to the amount of Â£100,000 was taken for
export to Egypt. On Tuesday Â£2.000,000 is due
for the new treasury bills and this is awaited
anxiously as a crucial test Of the money po
sition.

Condition of the Treasury.
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.â The Financier says:
The increasing demands for interlorcrop mov
ing funds Is ahown in a loss of $Â£7*2,200 cash
by the Associated Banks of New Tork for the
week ending September 22. All this money was
chipped ' west and south, operations with the
subtreasury having resulted in little change
either way. The interesting feature of the
weekly statement is a decrease of $2,689,600 In
the loan Item, the first contraction of conse
quence that has been noted since the third
week in July. The change for the current
week Is not large, but derives significance
from the fact that the drain of cash out of
New York has led rome of the banks to cur
tail outstanding commitments. The fallacy of
forecasting the probable volume of Interior de
mands over a fall season is well shown In the
present depletion of reserve, the shipments so
far this year having been fully up to the
ordinary, despite the assertions that New York
would not be called upon to finance the crop
harvest As it is the banks have a much
heavier reserve than usual at this period, but
as the shipments of money are not over by
any means, It will be only logical If a further
Â«hrinkaÂ«pe In loans results. The situation is
pomewhat complicated by the adjustment of the
German and Swedish loans now being negotiat
ed here, but so far as ordinary commercial and
local business Is concerned everything favors
a firmer money market. It Is not to be for
gotten that the deposit account is much higher
than the average, necessitating a larger volume
of cash reserve and to meet present needs a
contraction in other items releasing part of
this reserve. Is the ordinary remedy. For the
week Just ended the reserve shrinkage la
smaller than the actual loss in cash, because
qf this very operation.
This is in direct contrast with the exhibit
of the previous week, when expanding deposits
due to rising loans made the reserve less heav
ier than cash phrinkage. The fact that the
circulation of the banks has increased over
100 per cent in the last year renders it possible
for the banks to ship West a large amount
of money that does not deplete reserves or af
fect totals.

JUDGE ROSS TO
GIVE DECISION
ON OIL CLAIMS
Students of stock transactions on 'change
cannot but note the slight effect produced on
values by good news. There are stocks which
represent property j on which repeated strikes
have been made, some of them of great Im
portance, and yet the stock is selling to-day at
practically the same Â¦ price It brought before
oil was discovered. In one case a â¢ company
now has a dally production of fullj\400 barrels
from three wells and the stock 1 has not fluctu
ated more than five points since the company
was a non-producing wildcat. This makes , It
look as . though most of â¢ the stock selling ia
based on the hope of immediate returns rather
than selection for. revenue producers. Much of
the stock of many companies-Is held as a source
of present or prospective revenue, but It looks
as though little buying with that In view took
place on the exchange.
the greatest use for crude fuel oil in Cali
fornia will be found in metallurgical work.
Oil is used at the Selby Smelting Works
In melting down silver. All the oil used
is blown with steam. The solution to the
question of how to work copper ores pro
fitably may be the use of petroleum.
A company has begun. operations in the
vicinity of Tehachapi. It bears the appro
priate name of the Summit Company. No
oil has been found there, nor have there
been any marked seepages to be observed,
but there are great expectations based
upon the report of an expert.
The Los Angeles Herald calls attention
to a phenomenon in the market for oil
company's stock. It says:
"Why has the Standard Â£ entered this
field?" counter-queried Mr. Miller. "Be
cause we are in- tho petroleum business
and because we have been Importuned by
producers and dealers to do so."
The fire >that . destroyed -the â¢ pumping
plant of the Oxnard and Sea Cliff Com
pany at. Summerland will have the effect
of stopping sixty wells In the center of the
field. ...
Ernst A- Dsnlcke says that probably
that evidence of oil formation did not en
title It to be considered as oil land until
discovery of oil was made.. There was a
large array of attorneys in Los Angeles
when the testimony was taken. Judge
Ross has notified the lawyers that the de
clelon will be given upon the opening of
court. The decision will be of great inter
est all over the State and especially In
the Kern River district.
W. S. Miller, manager of the Standard
Oil Company's Interests on the coast, has
been Interviewed concerning the attitude
of his company toward the Kern River
district producers of petroleum. He sai.l
that- the Standard Company was going
into the, Kern River district to buy oil.
He was not prepared to say anything
concerning the Sunset District until a rail
way was built in there, supplying a way
to get the oil out Three 35,000 barrel
tanks had been shipped- to the Kern River
district and others -would be supplied as
they- were needed for the use of the com
pany. No contracts had yet been made In
the Kern River district, for: the company
was not ready to do business . there yet,
but would be In about, one month. Tho
company would not refine the Kern River
fiistrlct;oil. It was entirely a fuel propo
sition. If greater storage' was needed in
San Francisco it would-be provided. 1 All
this Mr. Miller said.
Late last night the knife wielder was
arrested and booked on a charge of an
assault to commit murder. He claims
that he did not know he had stabbed his
brother until told so by a companion.
Prior to cutting his relative, he claims,
he had a row with another boy and when
his brother spoke to him he drew his
knife, not knowing what he was doing,
and struck at him, not Intending to in

Frank. "Some time ago I spoke to him
about his wayward tendencies, and he
picked un a carving-knife and hurled it
at me. I managed to dodge the weapon
and thus saved myself from being injured.
Two days ago he threatened to send me
to the Morgue, and my mother told me
to look out for him. When I returned
home the following night he met me, but
did not attempt to injure me. He after
ward told our mother that he Intended to
kill me at that time, but as I wore a

FRANK PELLETIER. aged 15
years, was stabbed and severely
wounded last evening by his
brother, Charles, aged 14 years.
Tho cutting occurred at Four
teenth and Mission streets. According to
the wounded boy he was walking along
Mission street in search of the vicious
brother, when the latter accosted him and
demanded to know why he was looking
for him.
"I want you to go home with me," re
plied Frank. "Mother is worried over
your absence."
Without deigning to reply the murder
ous youth drew a. long knife and plunged
the blade into his brother's side. Not
knowing he had been stabbed, Frank
grabbed his brother and in trying to dis
arm him one of the fingers of his right
hand was cut. After he had taken the
knife from Charles the wounded boy
walked across the street to an electric
light, and while examining his hand to
eee how badly it was cut he discovered
that he had been stabbed in the side. By
this time his brother, evidently fearing
arrest, had run along Fourteenth street
and disappeared In the darkness.
Acting on the advice of a friend Frank
went to the Railroad Hospital, where the
wound in his side was treated.
Subsequently he was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital. On being Informed of
tho cutting Captain Seymour sent Detect
ives Ed Gibson and Crockett to arrest the
knife wielder. They visited the scene of
the stabbing, but were unable to get a
trace of the boy.
Shortly after Frank had been taken to
the Receiving Hospital his mother visited
him. She told the doctors tnat Charles
had been away from home for about a
month and' seemed bent on leading a dis
solute life. Frequently, she said, he de
clared that he would kill his brother. She
paid little attention to his threats until
several days ago, when he showed her a
knife after remarking that he intended
using it on Frank, She told the latter of
his younger brother's bloodthirsty re
marks., but thinking he was only joking
be laughed at them.
