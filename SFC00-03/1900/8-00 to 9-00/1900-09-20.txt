KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 19.â A spe
cial to the Sentinel from Coal Creek says
about 300 miners and day laborers em
ployed by the Coal Creek Coal Company
are out on strike. The men demanded that
day laborers be given an Increase In
wages which would make their pay
equivalent to that of laborers employed
by other companies In the Coal Creek and

there was a great roar of "Yes."
President Mitchell was In the crowd and
ner, but gradually degenerated into im
passioned argument and wound up very
close, to personalities.
Over, a thousand persons were present
at the meeting. Before the arrival of the
HAZLETON. Pa.. Sept. 19.â The
third day of the strike passed off
as quietly, as the two preceding
days. Beyond the occasional
stoning of a mine worker going
to or. from his work there has been no
disorder. It was estimated to-night that
about 70 per cent of the mine workers of
this region were idle to-day, which 13
quite an increase over yesterday's figures.
President Mitchell did not issue a formal
statement to-night because of his ab
sence from headquarters. He said, how
ever, from reports he had received he
figured on more than 126,000 men being
idle in the anthracite district. He added
that most gratifying reports were re
ceived from this and the Schuylkill dis
trict.
No negotiations for a settlement of the
strike are yet In sight and the situation
in that respect is precisely the same as
it was yesterday.
The United Mine Workers of this section
are confining their efforts to get the men
to quit work everywhere, believing that
they cannot successfully carry on the con
test unless every operation in the three
districts is tied up completely. The oper
ators appear to be doing nothing toward
a settlement of the trouble. ' They are
working the collieries which are crippled
as best they can.
The mine owners In the Hazleton district
complain bitterly of what they call the
"cruel tactics" of the union. They claim
that the workmen, who -are still going to
; the mines are being Intimidated and even
! threatened with serious bodily harm 12
they do not quit work. They also add
that most of the men now Idle desire
to resume work, but through fear of as
sault they do not leave their homes.
The meeting this afternoon at Jeddo of
the employes of G. B. Markle & Co., who
operate the Jeddo, Ebervale, Highland
and Oakdale collieries, proved to be prob
ably the most remarkable gathering of its
kind ever held In the anthracite regions.
It was expected to be a heart-to-heart
talk between John Markle, managing
partner of the firm, and his employes,
who number 2S00. but it developed into a
joint debate, in which Mr. Markle, Presi
dent Mitchell, Rev. Father Phillips and
National Committeeman Benjamin James
took part. It began in a dignified man-
one-story building and the schoolmaster
stood at the door.
Mr. Mitchell said in brief tha,t he re
gretted that the men of the Markle mines
were divided but was glad that those who
opposed the strike were in the minority.
He said the eyes of 138,000 miners were
looking toward them and that if all
stopped work the victory would be won;
but. on the other hand, if a few went to
work it would injure the interests of all
the men.
Then John Markle made his way toward
the crowd of miners and started to ad
dress the men. Mr. Markle was unable
to speak for a while because of interrup
tions by many in the crowd. Several of
the United Mine Workers' officials at
tempted to get the crowd to disperse and
not to listen to Mr. Markle. The latter,
however, won over the gathering. He told
them the company stood ready to arbi
trate any differences with the men. He
said the company had an arbitration
agreement of long standing with the' men
and that he would live up to it, and ex
pected the men to do the same. He also
said that he would abide by the decision
of the arbitrators, no matter what the
award might be. Mr. Markle concluded
his address by paying his respects to the
United Mine Workers' officials, calling
them agitators and charging them with
being responsible for all the turmoil In
the region.
Mr. Mitchell then got on the steps, and,
standing beside Mr. Markle, told the
crowd that the United Mine Workers
would not accept arbitration on that
basis. It must be the whole region and
not a part of It.
Mr.' Markle again addressed the men
and reiterated what he said last Sundayâ
that he would accept Archbishop Ryan as
an arbitrator, to which Mr. Mitchell re
plied that he would accept the Archbishop
on the basis that the United Mine Work
ers proposed, arbitration for the whole
region at one and the same time.
At this point Father Phillips, who was
In the crowd, was called upon and de
livered a speech favoring arbitration. He
told the men that there was a chance to
arbitrate their honest differences, and if
they did not seize the opportunity they
would be giving organized labor the hard
est blow it has ever been dealt and that
all the men who refused the offer de
served all the hardship that the operators'
could put upon them in a hundred years.
President Mitchell and Mr. Markle
again spoke, and Benjamin, James also
addressed the men, 1 but their remarks
were largely of a personal nature. The
meeting lasted two hours, breaking up at
twilight. Iftipl
The strike leaders claim that as a re
sult of the meeting the Markle mines
will be closed. to-morrow, while the firm
claims that'the meeting was a packed one
and that its mines will operate to-mor
row as usual.
The McAdoo marchers to the number of
250 marched to Coleraine this afternoon,
where they gathered quite : a crowd and
listened to addresses by strike leaders.

Agree to Return to Work.
I., LEBANON, Pa., Sept. 19.â At 4 meeting
President Mitchell of the United Mine Workers says that 126,000 men in the anthracite coal
fields have quit work. Marching has begun in the Haselton district, and timid people fear a repetition of
the horror of 1807, when the marchers were shot doivn by deputies. So far, however) no overt acts have
been committed, and the marchers have induced several hundred miners to quit zvork. Mine operators
continue to threaten to fight the United Mine Workers' Union to a finish.
to-day about three-quarters of the 1200
men employed by the American Iron and
Steel Company, who struck on August 1
on account of a reduction of wages of
puddlers, agreed to go back to work at
the rate offered, $3 per ton.
DID NOT ATTEMPT FORCE.
Expected Clash in the Lykens Region
Sidetracked.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 13.â All was
quiet in the entire coal field to-day. Even
the much-advertised clash in the Lykens
region of the Pennsylvania Railroad Com
pany was sidetracked through the de
cision of the strikers at Lykens that it
would be unwise to march on the non
union strikers at Willlamstown and force
them to quit work. Nevertheless there
were fewer men at work to-day than yes
terday, President Mitchell claiming that
more than 126,000 men are now idle. Con
tradictory reports come from the Schuyl
kill region, one to the effect that the
strikers at Morey, after being out two
days, had decided to-night to return to
work to-morrow, but this is received with
incredulity at strike headquarters.
The mine operators, after generally
maintaining' a silence for several days, are
showing a disposition to talk for publi
cation, and as a result several statements
from their side are printed. All breathe
the same spiritâ no recognition of the
United Mine Workers and a fight to the
finish with President Mitchell and his fol
lowers.
Marching makes the timid men and wo
men in the Hazleton region nervous be
cause of the terrible result of that sort
of campaign in 1S57, when the deputies
shot down marchers. Marching began tn
earnest there to-day. The marchers were
peaceful, however, and they succeeded In
inducing several hundred' men to quit
work, temporarily at least.
The Reading Company is getting ready
to reap the harvest presented to it by the
tieup in the other coal districts. Nearly
all of its collieries in the SchuylklU re
gion have been working three-quarter
time, but orders were to-day issued plac
ing them en full time and henceforth all
the mines will be operated to their full
capacity. Even with this extra output
the company cannot supply the demand
and It served notice on. the West to-day
that extraordinary orders could not be
filled.' i Meanwhile reports are coming
from all parts of the country of large in
crease in the price of coal to consumers
to keep the orders down.

VANTOrVER, B. C, Sept. 19.â In an
Ir/rrview with Lieutenant R. P. Hobson,
7:: Wished 5n a local paper, Hobson Is
qu^tod as paying- that AdmiraJ Dewey did
not Fir.k the Spanish phips at Manila, but
that the Spaniards opened the valves and
scuttled the ships themselves. He bases
his conclusions upon the fact that he saw
the hulls cf the Spanish flf-et when the
Fhips had been taken to Hongkong for
repairs, arid he says those hulls were un
ir.jured below the water line. The per
tlr.er.t part of the Interview follows:
Asked in what condition he found the
hulls of the Isla de Cuba, the Isla de
Luzon and the rest of the fleet when he
arrived at Hongkong to superintend re
pairing operations. Lieutenant Hobson
ssJd:
"The damage to the hulls was mainly
the result of the six months" submersion.
The upper -works had been badly damagred
by fire, the woodwork having been de-
Ftroyed and the iron plates being badly
-wlsted by the heat."
"What, In your opinion, was the direct
cnuse of the foundering of the vessels?"
he was asked.
"Oh. the Spaniards pulled out the plugs

and opened the valves. They sank the
ships themselves. Our shell fire did very
little damage."
"Then they were not. Injured below the

"Very little," replied Hobson- "We had
practically done them no damage there
at all."

STRIKE OF MINERS
CONTINUES TO SPREAD
RENO, Sept. ID.â One of the most dar
ing robberies ever recorded in this State
occurred at "Winnemucca to-day at noon.
Three masked men, with drawn revolvers,
entered the front door of the First Na
tional Bank and compelled the cashier to
hand over gold coin to the amount of $20,-
C00. Laden with their valuable loot they
then dashed from the building and made
good their escape, replying with a volley
of bullets to the scattering shots fired at
them by citizens on the streets.
The entrance of the robbers into the
First Xational'Bank was first heralded by
the curt demand:
"Throw up your hands, every one
of you!"
Cashier Nixon made a move as though
to draw a revolver, but the weapon of one
of the outlaws was aimed at him and he
threw up his hands just in time to save
his life. The robbers then threatened
with instant death the first man who
made any show of resistance.
There were five persons in the bank at
the time â Cashier Nixon, Assistant Cash
ier McBrlde, Bookkeeper Hill, Sten
ographer Calhoun and a horse-buyer
named Johnson.
One robber, at the point of a pistol,
made Cashier Nixon open the safe and
took from it three- sacks of gold coin,
each containing $5000. They then threw
this gold into an ore sack, together with
all the coin In the office drawer, amount-
Ing to from $6000 to $3000. The robbers
then marched the five men out through
the back door of the bank to the alley,
where they had three horses in waiting.
The men were kept covered with revolvers
until the desperadoes mounted their
horses and escaped.
The whole affair occurred within five
minutes and was a most daring piece of
work. An alarm was quickly given and
several shots were fired at the robbers as
they sped through the town, but without
effect. They returned the fire, but no
one was hurt. .
Officers and armed citizens have started
in pursuit of the robbers, who took a
course up the river. A posse has also
started from Golconda to head them Â¦off
and it is thought they cannot escape.
The amount obtained by the trio la not
known to a certainty, but is in the neigh
borhood of $20,000.
Fr^nk M. Lee of Reno, president of the
Winnemucca bank, was interviewed in
repard to the robbery and said that he
had no information, other than that al
ready given out.
"There are at present fifteen heavily
armed men. well mounted, in pursuit of
the robbers." said Mr. Lee. "and as there
is a good reward offered for their capture,
dead or alive, I do not think they can
escape."
Mr. Lee went to Winnemucca to-night
t and will immediately organize other
posses. He will spare no expense in the
effort to capture the desperadoes.
At the time of the robbery the bank
i contained over &O.00O In coin, but the
' greater part of it was overlooked by tha
robbers and baps containing silver were
handed over, while the gold was retained.

In speaking of the effects of the trusts.
Mr. Bryan warned the farmers not to get
cauKht In the barbs, as the barbed wire
went up under the influence of the baxbed
wire trust.
. Mr. Bryan took dinner here and left at
1 o'clock for St. Joseph.
ST. JOSEPH. Mo., Sept. 19.â There were
three times as many people at Baseball
Park this afternoon as could hear Mr.
Bryan. Not only were the grand stand
and the bleacher, seats crowded but the
body of the park was also well filled. The
ladles in the grand stand waved small
flags as Mr. Bryan approached. He was
seated In a carriage drawn by two cream
whltH and two coal-black, horses. At this
point the arrangement for reaching the
standing was the best yot experienced by
Mr. Bryan, the way being cut off by a
wire fence. This saved much of the usual
crowding and was a great protection. â¢
Mr. Bryan was still hoarse, but he spoke
for an hour and a half. He said: Â¦
sometimes great significance In accidents:
sometimes It seems as If there Is a divinity
that shapes our ends and brings Into closer
conjunction those things that naturally ought
to so together.

Sixth streets. The audience "extended

Mr. Bryan asserted that the Republican
party had completely chanced its code of

LEAVENWOETH, Kane.. Sept 19.â
The crowd, which gTeeted Mr. Bryan here
was large and enthusiastic. Mr. Bryaji
said that the Democratic platform Is In
the Interest of the people. He wanted not
to Injure the- rich, but to promote har>
mony among all classes. He declared that
in order to be in good standing at the
present time a Republican must be able
to Chance his convictions upon a mo

Mr. Bryan concluded his present tour
with his speech- here, leaving a.t 6:45 p. m

has been absent since August 29. Before
leaving he was tendered a public dinner
at the Donovan House and Introduced to
many of the residents of the city.

How shall this nation influence the world?

Is such that people trust his Justice and sub

believe this nation can stand among- the na

can be. so upright, so Just, that other nations
will look to us not only for example, but for
aid In time of trouble. Plutarch said that
men entertained three sentiments concerning
the. *Â«ds-that they "feared them for their

loved them for their Justice." Republicans do

Mr. Bryan said that It God was respon
sible for our position with tho Filipinos
and. commanded us to govern them, the
command should be evidenced either by
the Bible or by special dispensation. He
asserted that the Bible did not justify our
taking the Philippines, and said If there
wps a special dispensation he would like
to know to whom he revealed his plans.
A voice answered "Mark Hanna!"
"My friend." replied Mr. Bryan, "that
is undue familiarity with a sreat name"
and went on with his speech. Said he:

stop, during: which Governor Roosevelt
spoke in part as follows:
You should turn and laugh to scorn the poli
tician who tries to make you turn your backs
on the duties of an American citizen by the
cry of militarism. I have yet to meet in this
country tho first Imperialist. I never read of
one except in Democratic platforms. I have
not found him yet. I'll tell you what I have
found and what I believe Inâ that is the expan
rlonlst; the man who believes In the growth
of America; the man who believes that thU
nation is to play in the future an even greater
fiart than it has played in the past, and that
t will play that part well. . -
There are people who have been speaking
against expansion, and as great a statesman aa
Daniel Webster some fifty years ago declared
that It was useless to purchase this Northwest
ern territory, where you now are a great State,
because it was not worth a county In Maine.
That useless wilderness, as It was called then,
has now become a part of one of the great
States of the American Union.
At Blackfoot Governor Roosevelt made
a speech in the Courthouse square, in
which he said:
Some seventeen or eighteen years ago I waa
here. I lived in parts of the West where It
was middling rough and where a man would
occasionally escape a licking If he accepted
a kicking. He could get peace on those terms
but it waa not a permanent peace; because
when It was discovered that he took a kicking
easily other people took a part in the exercise.
Now, If we had let the Southern States go we
would have had war after war. and we would
have trodden a bloody path in consequence
Exactly as the generation of the past did Its
Bieat work well so we have got to do our lesser
work well. When the men of our nation cease
to give aid and comfort to our enemies peace
will coma to the Philippines.
the West, but we are a feeble folk and we can
nct hold the Philippines?" Are we to sit down
and do that? Rase Is the counsel and base
will be our people if they take that counsel.
We must go and play the part among the na
tions of the world.
Four years ago I am Informed that the
amount of wages paid the waijeworkers here
was much less than they are receiving now. I
learn that you ha4 some six hundred men em
ployed four yearn ago, whereas yoil have eight
hundred employed now In the shops here and
trainmen. Four years aga the average wages
of these men was $60 a month, whereas they
new get an average of $S5 a month. In 1S'."1
rrany mechanics had to be set at a lower grade
of work or do nothing, whereas now they are
busy.
Mr. Bryan said four years ago. again and
nrnin. that unless you elected him you would
have harder times than ever. Now I ask what
has been your experience? I ask you if wool
did not sell at about 8 cents five or six years
ago and whether it does not sell for about
double that now? Tou may remember the
story of the farmer who voted for free wool
tight years ago, who said he had come within
G cents of getting It. Compare the prices you
got four years ago with those you get now.
compare the earnings of the wageworkers now
with what we gqt then and see what it Is for
your Interest to do now.
At St. Anthony the Governor was driven
to the opera-house, where he said in part:
A -treat nation must d(* its great work.
Whrn It stops doing Its work It Is because It
has stopped doing things that make it a great
nation. We have got to stand in the forefront
of the nations of the earth at all times. We
have taken Hawaii; we have taken the Phil
ippines. It Is not a question of expand
ing now, but it Is a question of whether we are
Boinz to contract.
At Idaho Falls the train made a short
Expansion has been the law of our national
growth. It Is a great thing to have material
prosperity. What is it that we look bark to
with the greatest pride? It is the mighty deeds
done by men of American name. It Is the fact
that the wilderness here has been conquered
by you men of the West. It is the way our
people have moved forward and Buffered death,
enduih.g risks and hardships because they
were the mighty men of the people who have
Inherited the parth. To each generation Is
allotted its task. Now is this giant of the
West, those who have conquered the frontier,
to elt down Idly now with folded hands and
say "Our fathers worked, we rest; our fathers
tolled endurtd and dared, and. we stay at
home to avoid trouble; our fathers conquered
Imperialism you hear talked of. What does
It mean? It means nothing. There Is not an
Imperialist in the country that I Ijave yet
net. Expansion? yes; playing the part of a
great nation. Why am I speaking to you? Be
oiusp you and your forefathers expanded Into
tf.iF country; because you moved here In your
white-topped wagons and came across the
r.Ialns and over the mountains of Utah to be
come miners and ranchmen, and when you
got here you began to Irrigate the soil. And
that Is one of the problems of the. nation, and
the nation has got to help In solving It.

We have not b*-en left to stand alone In our

Notwithstanding this severe affliction I have
every confidence thnt the stricken districts will

her present desolation and sorrow arise with
renewed strength and vigor.
In purchasing these provisions I have bought
only those of kockI quality, and at wholesale

money to pay reasonable wages to all labjrers
who will assist in cleansing the city and re
moving the vast amount of debris that has
accumulated. Provisions and clothing have also
been shipped there to supply tlifwe who are
needy and unable to provide for themselves. I
have also made ample provision for the relief
of nifftrers as they reach and pass through
Houston from Galveston. As soon as I am able
I shall Bive to the public a complete Itemized

The situation in all 'parts of the stricken

FOR STATE SENATE
V.-hT^ar. Hon. Jullu*' Kahn has been cur
Rfpr*sPTuati\* m Congress from the Fourth
( rnprr*?iona] DiKtrict of the State of Califor
nia Cor the past two years; and whereas his
rrrcrd as a public rerv&nt -In the haJls of Con
gress is a *uiÂ«Â«rb one. and by his ability, char
acter and induFtry he haÂ« endeared hlmeelf to
the hearts of the people
Resolved. That the Continental League es
teems it a privilege to support the Hon. Julius
Kahn for Congress, and that It pledges Itself
to do all in Its power to reward this faithful
and able public servant.
J 1 ?? { o . How in& resolution offered by Mar
shall Woodsworth was adopted unani
mously:
Mr. Kahn thanked his audience for its
ir.ost cordial reception. He deprecated
the fulsome praise of the president, but
at the same time .Â«ald that no long as he
should be trusted In Congress by his con
stituents his energies would be bent to
the advancement of his city and his State.
He dealt unsparingly with the evident
fallacies of Democracy, a-nd held up as an
indisputable evidence of that party's in-
Finerrity the present unparalleled pros
jxrity of the country. '
Congressman Julius Kahn appeared at
Saratoga Hall last night and a half thou
sand enthusiastic people who had {fath
ered there at the invitation of the Conti
nental I^eapue gave him a royal reception
and* in a most flattering manner ratified
his renomination. Not only were the vot
ers of the district out in full force, but
there was a larpe sprinkling of ladles.
The spellbinders, the biggest the party
has placed on the stump, were there, and
oratory ran riot until the refreshments
were announced.
The guest of tho evening was introduced
by Frank D. Worth, president of the
league, who in a few well chosen words
summed up concisely Mr. Kahn's brilliant
record in. th* 1 !ast Congress. It was
through him. he said, that the Govern
ment appropriated $131,000 for a modern
quarantine station on Angel Island. It
Â¦was also due to him that San Francisco
manufacturers had received valuable con
tracts for making army shoes and that
the rock used in San Francisco's new
postofSce was California granite, mined
by California labor, instead of stone from
Eastern quarries. He also credited Mr.
Kahn with an amendment to the Chinese
exclusion law which prevented the land
ing at this port of 25,000 Chinese now in
the Hawaiian Islands. In closing he pre
dicted the re-election of Mr. Kahn by an
overwhelming majority.

i^ipi't fi r one supreme effort to v.rcst tho
convention from the control of Kelly and
< 'riirmins. More than one r*undrÂ»-d dele
vates attended the open conference at
*Â«hleta Hall. The enthusiasm displayed
â¢:i lho cause by men of the bifihest char
acter was inspiring. The number of dÂ«Mf-
CXtei BttendlnK exceeded the estimate of
the leaders. Positive assurance of sym
pathy and support were phen by dele
gates who could not attend. So many
<!<-Jinite i>ledses of active oo-operatiu:i
Â¦tvere without reservation that the
rrktKls of clean politics predicted that a
triumph over the bosses would be won in
the contest to-night on the floor of the
convention. Only the rankest and rawest
rullnss can defeat the anti-boss forces.
EfcveraJ imi>'jn:int iioestioni were set
tled last nifiht. It was resolved, no mat
ter what ihe outcome of the battle should
iÂ»i. that the anti-boss delegates should
not imperil the national and legislative
tickets l\v leaving the convention in a
Iody. In this respi-ct every man may
act for himself a? his conscience dic

create another Republican convention will

this meeting that we. as delegates to

man one who is opposed to Kelly and
Crirmnins and all corrupt boss influ
ence whatsoever, and that we depre
cate and oppose the election of the
present temporary chairman to bs
permanent chairman, as we believe
him to be under pernicious boss in
fluence.
In the resolution as reported by the
committee I'. A. Bersrerot's name was
mentioned, but it was deemed advisable
lu exclude the personal reference and
merely refer to the: temporary chairman.
In the original resolution Kelly was men
tioned its "the notorious." A. C. Rulof
son of the Fortieth District desired that
the words "the notorious" be stricken out
and the <3<\Â«::o was granted.
J. George Boyne remarked that as the
delegates wtre on the eve of an important
battle a ptas of campaign should be
adopted. He moved that a committee of
live be appointed to manage the n'Kht.
The motion prevailed and later in the
evening the chair appointed as follows:
A. Ruef, Forty-fourth district; 1^. A. Gib
buns. Thirty-seventh district; H. E.
Holmes. Thirty-sixth district; J. P. Mc-
Murray, Thirty-seventh district. and
Cna!W I.. Fields, Fortieth district.
A. liv.ff in reviewing the situation said
That the presence of so many delegates
iiiid th<- positive assurance of . support
from dt legates who could not attend
gave great encouragement. He said the
representatives of ore hundred and sixty
u'\< jratÂ«.-s wore present. He advised that
every delegate V>e on the floor of the con
vention early. He knew that courage, en
em nod tkiU would be required to de
'<;.i the bosses, as an advorsc chairman
would call ; he convention to order. He
remarked further: ."Nothing is safe in
politics but results. We Sort the other
day by overconfidence. Promises were
made "which were not fulfilled. We have
th< light, won. but must not lose it by ne
plwt to natch our interests. I ajn satis
fied that we will have lt>0 votes to-mor

announces the vote correctlv."

Fniri it was important to know In advance
whether the anti-boss df-legatcs on the
committee on credentials would present a
minority report.
Chairman Center raid: *'lt is undor-
Ftood that we will have a report, from
the minority."
(,*nrze W. Elder said the fact ought to
be made known to all the delegates to
the convention that Bergerot supported
Pnelan in the last campaign.
Mr. Ruef^referred to the common talk
of a walk-out in the event of boss roc*
cesa in the fight for permanent chairman.
He said:
â¢'The matter of bolting ought to be con
sidered now. We ought to make our flght
in the party and not walk out if we lose.
'Applause.) I desire to make a motion
now that even if ww shall not succeed in
our efforts to dislodge the bosses we shall
remain with the convention and if any
retire they Ehall not retire to organize
another convention."
"The motion is that we stay with the
convention even if defeated." eaJd Chair
man Center.
Dawson Mayer advocated a vigorous
contest for clean politics within the party.
H*> said it would be dis-aetrous to the
twrty for the delegates to leave In a solid
body.
Delegates Knifcht and Macbeth said
there should be no encouragement given
to any plan for a separate convention.
James A. "Wilson Â«Â»aid: "If any walk-
Ing out is to be done let Kelly and Crltn

TOM BROWN WINS
A BLONDE GIRL
By the Force of His Fist He
Gets a Medal and a
Sweetheart.
In four rounds of clever fighting 1 Frn.n!i
Â¦Wall got a decision over Jim Little. Billy
Jones and Ed Savasre then went at It.
Savage, who was thickly corpulent In his
"downstairs" region, succumbed to the
tappings of William Jones. AI Wlldson
didn't like his man. Gus Salisbury, who
struck him so violently in the eye In the
first round that he quit on the spot. Tho
match between Mike Curtin and Tom
Hamilton went five rounds and was called
a draw. Curtin is a cousin of "Spider"
Kelly, but that Is all the relationship ex
isting between them.
" Fierce and hot were the fights. Each
of the first three matches ended In tha
third round. Jack f'ordell went at Joh:i
Smith in whirlwind fashion for two
rounds and a fair section ot the third.
Then Smith went to the floor and meas
ured his length. Eddie Battler, by a series
of hard punches on Charley Wltzel's
stomach, won a bright silver medal. Lit
tle George Fuller sober and sad. made
Ed Devlin regret that they were matched.
Fuller punched Devlin until the fight wa3
off in the third. Ed Wiley had sufficient
punishment in two rounds to last ntm for
a while, so Alec Greggaina, the referee,
made Hugh Friel happy with a breas:
ornament.
Flat on his back dropped Jacobs and he
dreamed of the pleasures and joys that
might have been. Brown won out and
Jacobs went out. Between the two they
held the crowd at the San Francisco Ath
letic Club last night In delirious excite
ment. Theirs was the last event on the
programme. All the others were fought
for prizes onlyâ the last one for a lady
and a prize. The lady was hard pressed
by the attentions of both pugilists and be
ing unable to decide from their mental
qualifications which one she would have
she set her admirers to the test of fists.
They were both willing to enter the ring
to win her favors, so the match was ar
ranged. Brown pro\ted the champion. He
now has a medal and a fair-haired girl.
Tommy Brown won the ladyâ auburn
hair, cherry lips, pink complexion and all.
It was a hard tight while It lasted, two
minutes of the first round and the finish
being the most sensational part of It. J.
P. Jacob3, rival of Brown for the affec
tions of the fair-haired one, was picked
as the winner and he looked it for more
than 100 seconds. Then Brown "soaked"'
a few stiff ones to the chin of Jacobs and
the latter mounted the historic ladder In
a sleep that lasted more than ten seconds.

STANTX5RD TTXIVETtSITT, Sept.
IX â "Our Government seems to be
doing the honest thing in China
to-day, ar.d there is no criticism
that " could be justly made con
cerftng its policy as far as I know. All
thaf could v be done to protect our rights
and the lives of our citizens was done."
So spoke Dr. David Starr Jordan, presi
dent of Stanford University, when ques
tioned to-night concerning what he had
seen while in the Orient during the past
summer. President Jordan was. in Japan
at the time the allied powers were batter
ing down the walls of the Chinese empire
and is probably the best qualified man in
the country to-day to speak authoritative
ly en the Oriental problem.
"The problem before us now,'" he con
tinued, "is to do what we can to prevent
such outbreaks again and to restore a
wholesome condition by wipe diplomacy.
This can be done only by peaceful meth
ods. China cannot be conquered nor par
titioned. In the first place it would not
pay from the standpoint of trade. Sec
ondly, it is impossible. The combined
civilized nations could not maintain an
army inland. It would be either butcher
ed or starved. Russia may be able to
grab some of the insulax territory in the
northeastern part and Germany take a
few cities along the coast, but that Is all.
"China is not the place to send troops.
Soldiers can conquer armies, but cannot
bring peace among citizens. The Amer
ican Government had a great oppor
tunity to set the world a noble example
of magnanimity. We should discourage
any desire for revenge. I^ife should be
spared and no territory demanded. When
It comes to the discussion of a money In
demnity, that, too, is out of the question,
for the simple reason that China has no
money to pay with. It is to America's
Interest to establish peace as quickly as
possible and this, I think, is" being done.
This Is true from a commercial point of
view. China, like all other nations,
trades where it can do the best, unless un
der duress, then it doea not trade at all.
Trade Is fostered when people are satisfied
under their own flag and there is no other
way of accomplishing either more or as
much."
Speaking of the actions of the different
troops President Jordan characterized thii
Russian Tartars as far worse than th<j
Boxers themselves, while the Â¦ German
troops were under such barbarous orders
that they could not be expected to be
Special' Dispatch to The Call.
Speaking of our diplomatic representa
tives in China. Dr. Jordan said that Min
ister Conger was a good man and an able
official, but that our Consuls were not
what they ought to be either in Integrity
or ability, and that he hoped this lament
able condition Â¦would soon be remedied.
While he believes the Japanese Govern
ment has the best of intentions, he can
not understand why troops are now being
sent to Amoy.
While in Shanghai President Jordan no
ticed that the natives were disposed to be
more friendly toward Americans and
tended toward the American fashion of
dress.
Dr. Jordan Is highly pleased with the
results of his trip, which was taken for
the purpose of collecting specimens of
fishes from the coast and inland streams
of Japan. About 10.000 specimens were
obtained, of which 120 are new to science.
Every part of Japan was visited In the
search and everywhere the most courte
ous treatment was accorded. President
Jordan has been engaged by the Japanese
Government to write a book on the fishes
of Japan, which will be used as a text
book by students of their schools and
colleges. The work will be published by
the Imperial University.
The proper expansion can be made only
through education. Our merchants should
exhibit what they have to sell in the trade
centers of the Orient, so that the people
there may come to know what they lack
and In time learn how to use what we
have for them. Along the lines of mining
and railroad transportation there aro
splendid openings for American capital.
There will in the future also be a call
for students from the two California uni
versities to teach Knglish at the Chinese
and Japanese colleges.
As to our trade prospects with Japan.
Dr. Jordan said that he considered them
very promising. While Japan has only
one-tenth the population of China she
gives us fully as much trade. This is
because her people are contented and at
peace. One of the greatest hardships Â¦with
which the Chinese people are confronted
is the "likui," or village and province
tariff, which must be paid on all koo<13
exchanged. The money derived there
from goes not to the Government, but to
the local officials. These petty officials,
not knowing how soon they may lose hotli
their positiuns and their heads, make the
most of their opportunity; the people pay
the penalty, but it doea them no good to
grumble.
much better. The Japanese as a people
are good allies and make brave soldiers,
while they have great reverence for
Americans and American Institutions.

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON. Sept. 19.-To pre
serve the entente cordiale of the powers,
R-uf=5'.a. has announced that ehe is willing
to modify her proposal to withdraw her
troops ar.d legation from Peking to the
extent of leaving a detachment there,
hrotigh Acting Secretary of State Hill.
f 'resident McKlnley will to-morrow reply
to the German request that Instructions
be given to Minister Conger to Indicate
persons responsible for the Chinese out
rages, tnd to that of Prince Ching that
the United States representatives be iu-
FT.rueted eo that peace negotiations may
be opened. Neither request will be
eranted.
Russia's modification of her original
proposal meets the expectation of the of
f.cials in view of the genera: opposition
developed. It is learned on excellent au
thority that the Russian note promises
that the etreneth of the detachment to be
left in Peking will bo determined by tlie
allied commanders. There is no doubt
that the modified proposal of the Russian
Government is satisfactory to the powers,
but it is desired by the President that
the several Governments interested shall
reach & definite understanding as to the
purpose of continued occupation.
The President does r.ot desire General
Cliaffee to remain In China a moment
lor^er than is absolutely necessary and
Â¦would like to order ail the trooys to Ma
nila and retain the two battalions of
rcarlr.es now in China at Peking to
Â«-uÂ£lt<1 the legation. The force which
this Government will retain in Peking,
however, will be determined by General
Chaff *e. In consultation with the other
commanders. The international force
must not only be sufficiently large to
protect the legations, but to preserve
crder and prevent another massacre- of
native Christians.
Germany's note demanding the sur
render of those responsible for the
Chinese outrag-es as a condition to
the opening of negotiations presents
a mast serious problem. It shows, ac
cording to officials, that the Berlin
Government proposes to take advan-
cf every opportunity to prevent
any action favorable to peace until
Count ven 'Waldersee reaches Peking,
Â¦u-hen the military situation, may be
such that operations against the
Chinese \cill be necessary.
The cfSclals say frankly that no nation
la the wcrld would surrender Its sub
lets to be punished by foreigners. Ger
many's suggestion that the iiinlsters re
port the names of the instigators of the
trouble would transform the diplomatic
body la Pckh;g into a star chamber, and
as Minister \\ U observed to-day, the ac
.. used iu contravention of all civilized
ia.w, are not to have an opportunity to

CATJSE OF GERMANY'S NOTE.
High Mandarins Held Responsible
for Peking Outrages.
BERLIN. Sept. 19.-It is understood that
the immediate cause tor the Issuing by
bermany of the circular note to the pow
ers regarding the Chinese settlement was
the fact that U Hung Chang during his
recent interview with Dr. Mumm von
fc-chwartzenstein. the German Minister te
<h!tia, mentioned a number of names of
â¢ugh Mandarins, hitherto wholly un
known, as those responsive for the Pe
king outrages, and said that China was
willing to punish them. This explanation
seems to be borne out by the following
statement made by the German Foreign
Office to-day to the correspondent of ihe
Associated Press in Berlin:
"What we want to avoid is an oppor
tunity for allowing China to impose any
sham concessions upon the powers by de
livering up for punishment persons who
had nothing: to do with the Peking atroc
ities. Hence It is %dvlsab!e for the rep
resentatives of the powers in China to
designate before hand all who are noto
riously g-uilty. Germany does not wish
to prejudice the case in any way. She
wishes to reach an agreement with the
powers regarding the guilty and their
punishment."
Sato, first secretary of the Japanese
legation Jiere, said to-day:
"1 think there will be no difficulty in
getting the powers to agree in principle
to ,, e G^ rman Position to punish tho
guilty. The real difficulty will be on de
eming how high to go. If they decide to
include Prince Tuan then they will find
that the Empress Regent was back of
him. Russia, in my opinion, will not now
wlthuraw her troops from Peking, Inas
much as Germany and the other powers
remain. She will decide that circum-
PLances have changed and that she must
remain also."
The chief of one of the embassies, dis
cussing the question this afternoon, ob
served :
"Probably all the interested powers will
agree to adopt the German proposition,
v.ith the possible exception of Russia
who has hitherto carefully avoided men
tioning the punishment of the guilty
Certainly the United States will adopt it."
Tne German papers, with scarcely an
exception, approve the circular note. The
Lokal Anzelger says: "Mere notorious
r.ess does not suffice for the assumption
of eullt. The Ministers at Peking must
produce proof against each person
charged."
The Berliner Post and the National Zel
tung declare that the note proves that
Germany does not wish excessive or un
reasonable demands, but that she will in
sist upon the punishment of those really
guilty as the only way In which China
can be taught a lesson which she will not
forget.
The Berliner Tageblatt remarks that the
proposition of Germany will demonstrate
whether any power deems Its special in
terests more important than the general
joint Interests.
The Vossiche Zeitung declares that Ger
many will r.ot be satisfleQ with half meas
ures.
The Boersen Zeitung contends that the
foreign envoys in Peking cannot afford to
place the Empress Regent and Prince
Tuan on the list and must, therefore, be
â¢â¢ontent with merelv naming the actual
anU-legation leaders.
The Xeueste Xachrichten demonstrates
at length the necessity of punishing the
ieal culprits.
MINISTER WTJ IS HOPEFTJX.
Anxious That Germany May Recon
sider the Proposal.
TVASmXGTOX, Sept. 19.â Minister Wu
Tlrg Fang was greatly Interested to-day
in Germany's note to the powers, asking
cotr.Mnfd action In a demand that those
responsible for the trouble In China be
punished as an indispensable preliminary
to any peace negotiations. When seen at
the leg-ation he had before him a copy of
the published text of the note.
"I can hardly believe that this step has
been taken," said he, "and if It has, it is
so unfortunate in Its influence upon the
general question that 1 am greatly in
nope CJermany will reconsider. The con
dition imposed upon China would amount
to determining: one of the subjects of ne
gotiations before negotiations had com
menced. The Chinese envoys are in
vested Â¦with, complete power to make
tÂ«*rms with the powers, so that when the
negotiations are opened this question and
p.ll others will be proper subjects for con
sideration and general settlement by
th<*e having complete authority to deal
witn them. But to take one subject in
advance, settle It and make its i execution
an Indispensable preliminary to negotiar
tions. is extremely hard.
"But more than this, such a condition
if imposed, is simply impossible, and being
impossible, the effect would be to bring
the peace negotiations to a complete
standstill. Suppose the situation was re
verF<vJ and this unfortunate trouble had
occurred in some one of the countries now
dealing with China. In the midst of ex
citement suspicion might have been di
reoted against persons high in authority,
even against the members of the royal
family in that country. Would that coun
try, when the question of settlement
came up. for a moment consider the sur
render of these persons vaguely suspected,
or would It not ask that all questions be
considered by the court which was to pass
upon the whole subject? Who could tell
to whom this condition would apn'.y?
There have been intimations against tho'se
high in Chinese affairs, but it would be
very hard. ves. Impossible, to say In ad
vance before the negotiators had con
sidered thÂ» question that thfse persons
Rhould be crlven up. Who would furnish
the proof? It is an Indispensable requisite
Recording to your recognized methods ihat
persons accused have the right to he
heard ana that their evidence shall be
taken into account in proving an accusa
tion. But according to this proposition
there â¢would bo a surrender of the party
first, before the negotiators had an op
portunity to consider all questions of
proof which might be presented. Under
these circumstances I am most hopeful
that Germany's note is less positive than
the published reports indicate. Recent In
dications have been that the difficulties
ov?r beginning peace negotiations had
been overcome and that very soon the
negotiations would begin. I-'or that rea
son I feeh that !t would be unfortunate to
impose a r condition which, being impos
sible, would bring the negotiations to a
halt. The effect of such a step In all
proceedings would be of disadvantage to
all parties cor.cernfd. to the powers nÂ«Â»
well as China. In short, lts^Weets
would be so far ranching that I am ex
tremely anxious that Germany may see
her way clear to reconsider the proposal."

istration officials will watch with interest
the case of Dr. Francisco del Valle Sr..
who was Secretary of the Interior during
the military government in Porto Rico,
and his son, native Porto Ricans, who
have applied for registration as voters in
Baltimore.
Dr. del Valle claims the right to regis
ter on the ground that he is a citizen of
the United States. The question of hia
citizenship is now before the Board of
Election Supervisors in Baltimore and !s
a matter that must be dealt with by the
Maryland Legislature. It Is possible that
it may reach the Federal courts, for If a
decision adverse to Tir'. del Valle should
be made in Maryland he could appeal to
the Federal courts on the constitutional
question Involved.
Pending a judicial decision as to the
status of the inhabitants of Porto Rico
officials of the Government decline 10
recognize them as citizens of the United
States. A few days ago a representative
of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Associa
tion called on Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Taylor to ascertain whether he
could legally go to Porto Rloo and con
tract with Porto Rican laborers to go to
Hawaii to work on sugar plantations.
He was informed he could not do so. but
that if Porto Rican laborers should come
to this country he could enter Into a con
tract with them here. Until '..here is a
judicial decision to the contrary executive
officers of the Government will hold that
the act of Congress not only carefully
avoided declaring the Inhabitants of Porto
Rico to be citizens of the United States,
but, making a distinction between them
and such citizens, practically declared
that they were not citizens, but were just
what the act declared them to be. citizens
of Potto Rico, and as such* entitled to the
protection of the United States.

OAKLAND, Sept. 19.â One of the moBt
severe earthquake shocks in years aroused
Berkeley at 11:55 o'clock to-night and
rumbled with less violence through Oak
land. The college town was so seriously
shaken that large frame building could be
seen to move.
The shock was accompanied by a deep
rumbling and lasted, apparently, more
than a minute. The entire town was
aroused. Hundreds of frightened occu
pants of residences rushed from their
quivering houses. Clocks and crockery
were knocked oft the shelves, brick
chimneys about town were crackeil and
some slight damage was reported from the
university grounds.
A big pile of lumber at the Southern Pa
cific depot in Kast Berkeley was thrown
down by the severe shake. Beyond the
severe fright no reports wore made of in
jury to -persons. The shock was very
much lighter In Oakland. Jt had the ef
fect of a. twisting: upheaval of the ground.

BANGOR. Me., Sept. 19.â A report,
sent from the asylum in which Congress
man C. A. Boutelle is receiving treatment
for aphasia, received by his family here
to-day, states without qualification that
he is rapidly improving. The brain ob
struction, which, by allowing a physical
pressure upon certain parts, made it im
possible for him to properly corjtrol his
nerve centers, has so far been absorbed
under the treatment he has been receiving
that he is now only slightly troubled in
thought or speech and in general he is
himself again. At no time during his ill
ness has his physical condition failed.
The physicians say that they are agree
ably surprised at his recent rapid gains
and they are confident enough to hope for
an early and complete recovery.

Wort of the capture and death of
Morales hns been sent to the Sheriff of
Los Angeles and the body will be kept
for identification, as there was a standincr
reward of $S00 for his body, dead or alive.
SA>; DIEGO. Sopt. 19.â Deputy Sheriff
Sam Thing- of Picacho arrived in the city
to-day with news of the killing of Pedro
Morales, the murderer of. Deputy Sheriff
Wilson of Los Angeles, last Sunday after
noon near the Real del Castillo. After
the murder of the Deputy Sheriff three
years ago Morales escaped into Lower
California. He was soon located there and
time and aeain plans were laid for his
capture, but he always escaped.. The
Mexican officials gave the American of
ficers full freedom, to hunt the murderer
in any part of their territory and in the
plans for his capture rurales played a
prominent part.
Last Sunday Morales ventured near the
settlement of Real and learning that tho
desperado was in that vicinity the J.udse
and two rurales set out to make the ar
rest. They came upon their man unex
pectedly, but no sooner did Morales see
the ofilcers than he opened fire. His first
shots missed their mark and Jn the return
volley from the officers one! of the bul
lets entered Morales' right cheek.
Although suffering and at a great dis
advantage on account of this terrible
wound Morales stood his ground for a
while, but all his bullets fell wide of tholr
aim. It was a pitched battle for several
minutes between the three officers and
the one criminal, but finally Moralfs
made an attempt to escape. He was fol
lowed by the officers and after an hour's
chase, the murderer was overtaken and
shot to death.

The tactics of the defense were very
skillful. They first introduced medical
testimony to show that the Inflammation
which caused Himes' death might have
resulted from excessive drinking, and
with this as a foundation proceeded to
show that the murdered man was a hab
itual drunkard and. Incidentally, that dur
ing his long: drunken sprees he abused his
son Fred In a shameful manner. Witness
after witness was called to establish this
feature of the case and before night
public sentiment had shifted somewhat
to the Fide of the defense. Xobody looks
for a conviction.
Tlie evidence for the prosecution con
sisted of tJie confessions made by Fred
Himes at the time of his arrest and later
at the Coroner's inquest. Some corrobo
rative testimony was taken.
The impanel Ins of a jury was a difficult
task. Some of the talesmen declared that
they were biased and many of them said
they would not return a verdict of mur
der against a boy of fred'** a^e. A special
venire had to be ordered before the jury
was obtained. The following talesmen
were eventually chosen: H. P. Cotton,
Andrew Anderson. A. A. Grimstead, G.

was his accomplice in the awful crime. He

EVERYTHING FAVORABLE
FOR A GREAT TIME
George H. Kavanaugh, 640 Market
street, San Francisco, purchased a one
quarter or $1 ticket in the lottery of the
Beneficencia Publica Company, City of
Mexico, In the August 23 drawing, which
won $20,000. his share being $5000, which
was promptly paid.
Another fortunate Investor was Charles
Martv, Twenty-fifth and San Bruno ave
nue San Francisco, who purchased a one
quarter or $1 ticket, No. 42,479, in the
above named lottery, which won $10,000,
his share being $2500, which was also
promptly paid.
Almost monthly one of the capital
prizes Is won here,- and this is the cause
of the popularity of the lottery of the
Bcneflcencia Publica Company on this
coast.
A further reason Is that the people
know that this Is the only lottery guar
anteed and protected by the Mexican Na
tional Government. All drawings are held
in public under the strictest vigilance of
federal authorities; therefore the fairness
of its drawings are vouched for by the
Department of State, the Mexican Na
tional Government appointing Dr. Gre
gorlo Orlve for the Treasury Department
and Apollnar Castillo Intervenor; there
fore everybody, is assured of the honest
dealings of the old reliable lottery of the
Beneficencia Publica Company, of which
U. Bassctti is president and manager.

UNUSUALLY GOOD BILLS
AT ALL THE THEATERS
George W. Smith, stenographer of
Judge Troutt's court, was called to the
stand to read his transcribed notes.
Barnes objected to the reading of the
confession by the .witness. The ftbjection
was sustained, but this morning- Mr.
Smith will answer the questions of the
District Attorney as to the authenticity
Richard J. Graf, cashier of Rauer's Law
and Collection Agency, testified that he
saw. the check given by Rauer to Chre
tien in payment for the deed in question.
The same was admitted in evidence and
identified by the witness. Rauer then tes
tified as to having advanced the money to
Chretien on the forged deed, after hav
ing been assured of its genuineness by
Chretien, whose statements were also cor
roborated by the record of the court.
Judge Troutt, before whom Chretien
confessed to forgery of the deed through
Colthorp, was called to the stand. Judge
Troutt testified as to Chretien's admis
sions before him and to the fact that
Chretien stated that he made his confes
sion of his own free will and without hope
of consideration.
John M. Chretien, director of the con
spiracy to loot Jhe estate of the late Jo
seph Sullivan, will in all probability hear
the judgment of the jury in the forgery
case before this day is over. The prose
cution concluded the presentation of its
case against Chretien yesterday, except
ing one point.- Chretien's confession of
the crime before Judge Troutt will be
read this morning to the jury and then
the defense will begin.
When the case was called by Judge
Dunne yesterday morning the work of
completing the jury was taken up. With
in an hour the box was full. Those who
will pass judgment upon Chretien are:
C Leonhardt, :2iW3 Golden Gate avenue;
Ciaus Schilling, 2210 Vallejo street;
George M Pond, 12 Front street; Thomas
KlricK. Examiner building; Adolph Bls
slnger 191S Jackson street; \\ . H. Henke,
ilOS Vallejo street; John Marshall, 27tW
Mariposa street; Richard Murphy, 274
Seventh street; Eugene J. Ensign, 23
Spear street; W. L. Turney, 620 Kearny
street- George Â£>. Baird, 405 California
street, and W." L. Cook, luo California
street. â¢ '
J. J. Rauer was the first witness called
to the stand, but an objection made by
W. S. Barnes, wno represents the defen
dant, was sustained and Rauer stepped
do%vn. Robert Colthorp, the colored ser
vant, who admits having signed the
forged documents at Chretien's request,
was then called, but was also ordered to
step down that an objection made by
Mr. Barnes' to his testimony might be ar
gued. Barnes contended that the forgery
of the signature to the deed purporting
to convey, the realty of the Sullivan es
tati to Rauer, upon which Chretien is
being prosecuted, could not be proved un
less It could be proved that the entire
deed was forged. After long argument
Judge Dunne overruled the objection and
Colthorp returned to the stand.
Colthorp testified that he signed the
name- "Joseph Sullivan" to the deed In
question at Chretien's request and in his
office. Under similar conditions he signed
two receipts and a check. On, cross-exam
ination he denied that he was a State wit
ness or had turned State's evidence, and
denied that he was testifying under any
inducement, as Barnes contended. One
of the instruments, he said, was signed
In a saloon at the corner of Montgomery
and Pine streets. At the time Fred Han
sled, .who Is better known as "Young
Dutchy," was there, the witness said.
Lee D. Craig testified that Chretien
called at his office with two other men.
One was Introduced as John Sullivan, and
after he had acknowledged his signature
on the deed in question went away.
Craig said it was not the custom to seo
a signature written, for in his capacity
as a notary an acknowledgment before
him was sufficient under the law.

THE cornerstone of the Gibbs
building, the first of the brick
structures which are to replace the
'present frame buildings of St.
Luke's Hospital at Valencia and
Twenty-seventh streets, was laid yester
day afternoon by Bishop Nichols. Among
those present at the impressive ceremony
were: Rev. R. C. Foute of Grace Church;
Rev.Marsden Wilson, secretary of the
diocese; Dr. David Maclure, Rev. P. Rellly
of St. Paul's. Rev. Mr. Clampett of Trin
ity; Rev. Mr. Turner, chaplain of the hos
pital; Rev. ti. C Sanford, rector of St.
John's; Rev. Mr. Collier and Bishop More
land. ' '
The exercises opened with the singing
of "The Church's One Foundation" by the
choir of Grace Church.
Colonel J V. D. Middleton, M. D., of the
hospital building committee, was president
of the day and delivered an interesting
address A copper box containing a dally
paper and literature relative to the hos
pital history, as well as a copy of Colonel
Middleton's address, was placed beneath
the cornerstone, which was then lowered
into place, Bishop Nichols laying the mor
tar with a silver trowel.
"I wart to call attention to one thing,
said Bishop Nichols In the course of his
address. "There shouid be no what I may
The new structure Is named after the
Glbbs brothers, whose lives and fortunes
were devoted to the hospital and to whose
noble work Bishop Nichols in his address
paid a glowing tribute.
Curtis & Willcox, tlie architects, have
utilized the most advanced ideas of hos
pital construction. They have united
simplicity of arrangement with adapta

and have avoided anything which might
even remotely promote Irritation or con

The new building, when finished, will
stand two stories and a basement high.
It will be 135 feet long and forty-four

of extreme cruelty. Rennison says he
married his wife in Vancouver, B.*C, in

he has regretted becoming a benedict. Spe

In addition to 'a decree of divorce Mrs.
Paton asks for a division of the commu
nity property snd alimony sufficient to
maintain her in accordance with her sta
tion in life.
According to the complaint, however,
Paton's most annoying eccentricity was
the practice of psycho-astronomy and
astrology. He believed, it is said, that the
affairs of life rre governed by the move
ments of the heavenly bodies 'and insisted
that he married his wife when his un
lucky star was in the ascendant. On
Christmas last his unlucky star
was again climbing Its way toward the
zenith, and, according to Mrs. Paton's
complaint, her husband obeying its in
fluence began to abuse her in the pres
ence of friends. He accused her of many
things, but. worst of all. of not being in
sympathy with his belief in astrology. He
ended. It is claimed, by driving away the
guests and prostrating Mrs. Paton.
Many eccentricities are charged to Pa
ton by his wife. In her complaint she
says she married him on March 10, 1SS4.
ICot long after their marriage. sh.e al
leges, her husband, not satisfied with his
own fortune, obtained control of her sepa
rate property, which brings a monthly In
come of $3T.. This he appropriated to his
own use. It is averred, and even denied
Mrs. Paton car fare. In two years Mrs.
Paton says she has been downtown but
twice, and thc?n she was forced to walk,
her husband refusing to give her a dime.
Every Saturday he would buy 50 cents'
worth of meat, and this. It Is claimed,
would be all be would allow purchased
until the following Saturday.
The unlucky star which John H. Paton,
capitalist, says bodes evell for him is
again In the ascendant, for yesterday
Mrs. SuÂ«ana Paton filed suit against him
for divorce, alleging cruelty as cause of
action. Shortly after the filing of the suit
Mrs. Paton's counsel went before Judge
Seawell and obtained an order restraining
Paton from disposing of his property or
drawing money from the bank until after
the disposition of the action for divorce.

The candidates for Congress who were
present were called upon for speeches,
and e-^ch in turn assured the committee
that he was sure of election. J. H. Henry.
J. F. Farraher. R. Porter Ashe, Frank
Freeman and Jo D. Sproul made speeches.
The two last named have begun their
active campaign. Sproul told of a thou
sand-mile campaign trip he had just made
into Mono and Inyo counties and said he
was looking for the man who laid out
the district. J. H. Seawell and W. R.
Jacobs, candidates for elector, also made
short speeches.
Mayor Phelan called attention to the
light registration and urged the necessity
of getting Democrats to register. F. V.
Dewey. publisher of the Hanford Journal,
said that registration was much more
complete In the country districts than In
San Francisco. Ex-Governor Budd
thought the Democratic County Central
Committee ought to be urged to take the
matter in hand. Max Popper said the
committee had done all it couldâ much
more than committees in the Interior
counties could do. He thought there is
unnecessary alarm, anyway, and predicted
that registration would be as heavy as
usual.
Ex-Governor Budd said the only way to
secure the money necessary would be to
appoint a State organizer. Seth Mann
agreed that the division of responsibllity
among the three commltteemen at large
from each district is not conducive to
success. He suggested an organizer for
each district, and a motion authorizing
appointment of them by Chairman Sims
was carried.
M. F. Tarpey explained that the exec
utive committee had decided to ask the
committeemen at large from each Con
gressional district to call meetings of the
committeemen of the districts to devise
means of raising the $1000 assessed to each
district. On his motion the action of the
committee was ratified. It was stated
that in no district had any steps been
taken to raise the money as requested.
The motion was carried with an amend
ment that the candidates present be asked
to confer with the chairman personally
before leaving the city.
Kx-Governor iiudd moved that the
chairman write letters to the candidates
for Elector and for Congress asking them
how much they would be willing to con
tribute to the cause in time or money.
"Some of those candidates," Budd said,
"have more time and eloquence than
money, and some of them have more
money than time or eloquence. Let them
contribute as they are able."
Chairman Sims called the meeting 1 to
order and stated its objects, among them
being the consideration of the money
question, the question of registration and
the distribution of literature.
Of the candidates for Congress, J. F.
Farraher of the First District, Jo D.
Sproul of the Second, Frank Freeman of
the Third, R. Porter Ashe of the Fourth, J.
H. Henry of the Fifth and W. D. Crlch
ton of the Seventh were present. J. H.
Seawall, candidate at large for Elector,
and W. It. Jacobs and W. T. Baggett.
candidates for Elector from the Second
and Fourth districts, respectively, were
in attendance.
No one Indulged in any criticism of M.
F. Tarpey or others of the commltteemen
at large for what has been regarded
among the faithful as a disposition on
their part to toot their own horns. The
lamblike submission of the members of
the committee is probably due, as one of
them explained, to the fact that Tarpey
is closer to Uryan than any other man In
the State, and will have much to say
about th<? distribution of plums should
the free silver candidate be elected. Many
of the members of the committee are
looking for plums and they can't afford to
offend Tarpey.
The most important result reached was
the adoption of a motion instructing
Chairman Sims to appoint an organizer
for each Congressional district, whose
duty it shall be to call the State Commlt
teemen of the district together and adopt
means to raise the $1000 assessed to each
district.
The Democratic State Central Commit
tee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at
the California Hotel, the chief object of
which seemed to be to Impress upon the
minds of the commltteemen the necessity
of raising funds. There were In attend
ance twenty-nine members of the com
mittee, six of the candidates for Congrress,
three candidates for Elector and various
local celebrities of the party. For tha
most part the members of. the committee
present were from San Francisco and the
immediate vicinity.

it was. I tried everything that I could

them did me any good, and I was con-
stantly growing worse all the time.
"I was in college at the time and after

IN SUPERIOR COURT
No candidate was ever more fortunate
than Mr. McKinley in respect to the sub
ject matter of his letter of acceptance,
and none was ever more successful In Its
treatment. The chief theme of his dis
course" was actually thrust upon him by
his opponents, who declared that it was
the paramount issue of the campaign. He
took them at their word and has put their
issue before the people in a way to make
them sick to death of the very name of
imperialism and sorry they ever made it
a paramount Issue. The President's let
ter is convincing, and that Is the highest
praise, for his whole purpose in writing
it was to convince. * The vexation it has
caused among those who are his enemies
without being friends of Bryan and the
pitiful straits they are put to in attempt
ing the hopeless task of refutation are a
testimony to the effectiveness of the let
ter as the chief document of the cam
paign.
President McKinley's letter of accept
ance, undoubtedly the most remarkable
and potent In influence of all the letters
written by Presidential candidates since
the custom of a formal acceptance came
into vogue, marks' the turning point in
the campaign. From now until the day
of the election McKinley and Roosevelt
will gain votes surely and rapidly, just
as McKinley and Hobart gained dally
after the August fright of 1S96 had passed.
After this wo think very few gold Demo
crats will venture to declare themselves
for Bryan becaufe they cannot condone
the imperlialism of McKinley.

A summary of the inquiry seems to be that if the Iowa

Flint would have been safe.
Republicans will take notice they cannot reasonably
expect 'a walkover if they sit down and do nothing.
Since the School Board has been so rigorous in its

The aged couple of Oakland who are starving them

they are playing into the hands of that inevitable con

A Folsom convict, who will shortly be hanged, has
â¢awakened to a rude realization of the fact that there
are some fictions of the law with which it is dangerous
to take liberties. He thought he had a perfect right
to kill a man who was legally dead.
Estheticism appears to be going to waste in Sausa

Public indignation is taking the form of a threat
ened impeachment of the local Board of Education.
Angry citizens seem to be overlooking the fact that

The Chinese war has been carried into the Univer

have a right to study Cantonese rather than Mandarin.
The difficulty appears to be largely a choice of evils.
Every time one of Bryan's 1896 predictions is
thrown in his face it hits him like a brickbat.
Wake up, Republicans. There is no time to lose.
Get your name on the great register and then see that
your friends register. Remember that the prosperity
of the country and the people willdepend for the next
.four years on the way the election goes in November.
The issues of the campaign are vital to the prosper
ity of the country. Bryan, who for' some time past
has been dodging the money question, has now come,
out and declared on:e more his adhesion to the free
coinage of silver. The financial integrity of the coun
try is. menaced as portentously as it was in 1896. The
uprising of the business and industrial elements of
the people, which was so characteristic a feature of
that campaign, should be repeated this year.
The warning that has come from Maine and Ver
mont should not be lost upon Republicans of San
Francisco. It is true that in each of those States a
sweeping victory was won for McKinley and pros
perity, but the vote of the Republicans fell below that
of 1896 by a considerable percentage in each State,
while the vote of the Democrats increased. It is clear
that in those States, at any rate, the Democrats
brought out the full vote of their party, while the-Re
publicans failed to do so. The results of the indiffer
ence among so many Republicans in Maine and Ver-
were not disastrous to the party solely because
in those States the Republican majority is so large it
can admit of a considerable loss without bringing the
party to defeat. Such, however, is not the case in
California. If we are to carry this State for McKinley
we must have alertness and vigor among the Repub
licans of every section of the commonwealth.
SWIFTLY approaches the day when registration
will close, and it is said there are still thousands
of citizens who have not yet registered and
made sure their right to vote. Of the neglectful
ones it is safe to say the great majority are of the
class known as "good citizens." The gangs that the
bosses control have all been registered before this, for
the bosses take no chances. Thus we have the para
dox that the very men upon whom the nation relies
for good government are about the only ones who
show indifference to governmental affairs.
WflKE UP, REPUBLICANS!
Whatever may be the personal merits of Mr. Loud's
opponent in this contest, the voters of the Fifth Dis
trict will recognize the fact that to elect him would
mean to deprive themselves of an able, experienced
and powerful representative at Washington for the
sake of a new man without experience, acquaintance
or prestige in the House. At the present time the
Fifth District is represented by one of the foremost
men^'n Congress, and it is not likely the voters will
be foolish enough to abandon him to follow an un
known man. however excellent as a private citizen.
It is further to be borne in mind that the chairman
ship of the Committee on Postoffices and Postroads is
one of particular importance to California, because
the scattered condition of our population in the moun
tains remote from railways renders it difficult for the
people of many districts of the State to obtain a regu
lar mail sen-ice. It is therefore a matter of good for
tune to California that the chairmanship of the com
mittee having charge of such matters is in the hands
of a Californian, who looks carefully after the inter
ests not only of his own district but of the whole
State.
Each successive session of his sen-ice in Congress
has been marked by some notably good work done by
Mr. Loud for his district and the State, in addition to
the high service rendered to the nation by his vig
orous support of protection, sound mpney and all the
great policies of the Republican party. The massive
Federal building now in process of construction in
this city, the extensive system of rural mail -deliv
ery in many parts of the State, and the appropriations
for clearing San Francisco harbor of Arch rock and
other dangerous obstacles in the way of shipping, may
be cited as instances of the work that marks his career
and attests the value of his sen-ice to all the interests
The position Mr. Loud now holds in Congress is
one of which even' voter in his district might bs
proud, for it should be a matter of no little gratifica
tion to a California constituency that its represent.i
tive\n the House holds the chairmanship of so im
portant a committee as that on Postoffices and Post
roads, and that he is among the few men who were
spoken of as probable candidates for the succession to
the Speakership when it became known that Reed was
to retire from politic?.
There are many reasons why independent voters
should support Mr. Loud. It is desirable from every
point of view that the next House of Representatives
be Republican; that in beginning his second term of
office President McKinley have a Congress in har
mony with his administration; that California be
represented at the national capital by a delegation
solid for sound mon?y and protection; that among its
representatives the State have men who have had long
experience in Congress and have acquired a potent in
f.uence among their fellow Congressmen; and, finally,
that the Fifth District retain in office a man who has
so faithfully guarded every interest of the district and
the State, Mid at the same time attained front rank
among the younger Republican leaders of the House.

COMMENTING, upon Bryan's letter of accept
l ance the Examiner said yesterday: "In his con-
demnation of the banknote and perpetual bond
features of the Republican financial policy Mr. Bryan
is in harmony with public opinion, but it is a pity that
he has felt compelled to drag into renewed promi
nence the dead issue of the free coinage of silver.
Much can happen â much has happened â in four* years.
What was possible in 1896 is impossible now. There
i? no longer any effective demand for free silver. The
Republicans. do not* want, it; : the Democrats do not
want it; even the' Populists do not want it."
That is a strong presentation of the argument now
being made with volubility and persistence through
out the East. -Men like Cockran and Schurz have
united with Hill and Belmont to assure the sound
money voters of the country there is no longer any
menace to the .currency, that free silver coinage is
a dead issue, and that the advocates of the gold stan
dard can with consistency vote for Bryan. Naturally
these orators and their organs feel annoyed when the
much-talking Bryan bolts from the path they have
marked out for him and takes to the free fields of
agitation with all the exuberance of utterance that he
enjoyed so much in 1896. They would be glad to
silence him, but, being unable to do that, they take
the course which appears in their eyes to be next best
and proceed to discredit him by declaring his words
idle and his policy futile.
In the controversy between Bryan and that plass of
his critical" supporters of which the. Examiner is a
type the public, has an interest. It is something more
than the ordinary faction fight perennial in the Demo
cratic camp. It involves an important issue that
gravely concerns the welfare of the republic. We can
afford to take no risks of a revival of the silver craze,
and if that issue be dead it will be well to have the fact
known and recognized.
In considering the point at issue between Mr.
Bryan and his Democratic critics the people will not
fail to .note that Bryan is a candidate for the Presi
dency and speaks with the authority and the responsi
bility of ihat leadership, while his critics have no re
sponsibility in the campaign and will have no official
power should Bryan be elected. Under such circum
stances Bryan's word is worth more than that of all
his opponents put together. If he declare free coin
age to be a live issue, and that if elected to the Presi
dency he will use all the powers of that mighty office
to remonetize silver, it will be vain for any one else
to say the issue is dead.
It happens that Bryan represents in this contest not
only the Democratic party, but the free silver forces
of all parties. The free silver Populists and the free
silver Republicans have nominated him jointly with
the Democrats. If free silver be not an issue, then
the nominations given him by the Populists and the
silver Republicans have been obtained under false pre
tenses and Bryan is the greatest hypocrite that ever
played the game of politics.
Furthermore, it is to be borne in mind that free sil
ver is the only important point in the three platforms
on which any considerable number of Bryanites are
,agreed. The Southern and dominant wing of the
party is well nigh unanimously in favor of imperialism
and expansion. While Eastern orators and organs arc
busily engaged in an effort to convince the voters of
that section that Bryan if elected could not and would
not pay the obligations of the Government in silver,
those in the South are equally vehement in assuring
Southern voters that he will not surrender the Philip
pines.
Taking all things into consideration the intelligent
voter will conclude that free silver is the chief issue of
the time, as it was four years ago, and as it will be so
long as it menaces the country. If any one hold a
contrary opinion he must believe Bryan to be a hypo
crite, whose pledges ?nd promises on any subject are
not to be, trusted.
THE FREE SILVER ISSUE.
It is too early to predict the political effect of the
strike. It will be likely to appear more among the
consumers than among the producers. Vast trans
portation and manufacturing interests depend on hard
coal. If the shortage in supply is prolonged, and the
encouragement given by Bryan and the politicians of
his party shall seem to be stretching out the strike
beyond its natural limitations by holding out false
lights and impossible hopes to the strikers, the politi
cal results may not please the agitators.
They tell us with a tiresome repetition that the
present generation of employers are heartless .ty
rants, who take delight in oppressing labor for the
sake of being oppressors, as well as for the profit they
get out of it. The only way to reform such a condi
tion is by example. Let Mr. Hearst put a few mil
lions of his profits out of the copper trust in a coal
mine, or a railroad, or a factory, and run it on the
principles which he advocates for others. Or let
Colonel Bryan quit running around telling farmers
that wheat is not high enough and laborers that bread
i> too high and take the fortune he has made running
for the Presidency and invest it in some building trade
fn Chicago or a coal mine in Iowa and come face to
face with labor unions as an employer. After such an
experience he might not talk as prettily, but he would
know more. The common sense of the country, and
that includes labor and its employer, is getting just
a little bit tired of having Hearst and Bryan con
tinually denounce as enemies of the country all men
who are employing labor and paying wages.
They never earned nor paid wages, but they hope
to get intp power by abusing those who do.
If Mr. Hearst is so sleepless and uneasy about the
wage-earner and Bryan is so shocked at the conduct
of men who have vitalized the country's industries and
pay the wages of its labor, why don't they go into
some wage-paying industry?
They do this under pretense of championing the
down-trodden -miner, while Hearst cares no more for
a coal miner than he does for the horse that hauls his
circulation to the crematory.
The Bryan politicians and the Hearst newspapers
have pitched into the midst of. the strike in search of
votes. They are doing their worst to change its
peaceful aspect, to rouse the passions of the men, to
incite them to violence and lawlessness and to bring
on a repetition of the horrible features of the strikes of
1892 and 1894.
T1ie affair began peacefully and placidly. In many
parts of the district 'he men had made no complaint
against the employers and said they had none. But
complaints were made for them by the executive
board, and no one can dispute the validity of many
of them. As for methods of screening ana loading the
public cannot pass judgment, not being wise in
mining. But if there is an overcharge for powder
and at the company store for the necessaries of life, of
that the public can judge, and its judgment will be
condemnatory- Mine-owners have no right to charge
powder higher than the wholesale rate in the open
market, with cost of carriage and storage added. No
excuse can be. made for the practice and it should be
stopped. Xof have they any right to overcharge for
the necessaries of life at the company store. The proof
of this does not appear to be very plain. But if the
practice exist it should be stopped. At such store
there is no risk of bad bills. The company has the
wages of the miners in its possession and deducts
therefrom the store account. That should be sufficient
guaranty against loss and should be a sufficient ad
vantage without adding a fictitious profit to the prices
charged.
There is some excuse for the company store, in
spite of the prejudice against it. As a rule a merchant
independent of the mine-owner does not care to keep
store at the mines 'unless he can collect his bjlls
through the company by an arrangement which makes
them a lien on the wages of the miners. Under this
system the friction is greater than that caused by the
company store. The disputing of bills and items be
comes common and disorder follows.
The supply of anthracite never gains much on the
demand. In a brief t ; me the supply will run short,
and the holders will of course put up the price. The
strikers deliberately put that advantage in their hands
and they will use it.
There is no use to discuss the difference that would
appear in the financial condition of the men if the
assessments taken out of them for the union treasury
had been instead deposited" in' the savings bank to
draw interest for the men who earned the money in
stead of being paid for dead horse. What is done is
done, and the men cannot recall it nor change the con
ditions it has created.
The mine-owners maintain an equally calm attitude
and declare that they will make no attempt to fill the
places of the strikers nor to discriminate against them
ir. employment when the issue is settled. The miners
hare notified the Sheriffs of the counties in the dis
trict affected that they will guard the property of the
mine-owners and protect it from any damage. This
is one of the reassuring features in the affair, and it is
reinforced by others. It is given out that the Miners'
Union has a very large sum of money on hand; the
product of assessment of the members for some time
past, upon which to sustain the strike. When the men
were called out many were reluctant to obey, and the
cheerful anr.ouncemeMt is made that a great many of
the men own their homes, which is another. insurance
against disorder.
Bryan and the politicians behind him have shown
some signs of suspicious inside information in the
matter that leads to the belief that, whatever may be
the motive and intention of President Mitchell, the
strike is regarded by Bryan as worth attending to as
a vote-getter. The statement of grievances issued by
President Mitchell was remarkably temperate in tone,
and cites the company store, the price of powder, the
docking for screening and the method of loading the
tramcars as the matters of complaint. The rate of
wages is only indirectly in issue, because of the re
ductions from the causes cited.
O FTER a month of preparation and indecision
/A President Mitchell ordered a strike throughout
the anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania. Â¦*

schools.â Resolution presented by Super
intendent Webster and taken under ad
visement by the Board of Education.
Superintendent Webster made an at
tempt yesterday to have the Board of
Education make an official declaration of
its Intention to adhere to tho priority of
sen-ice planin the promotion of teachers.
He introduced the foregoing resolution at
the board's meeting, but no action was
taken ajid the usual "taken under ad
visement" was uttered by Chairman
Mark. This course usually means months
of inaction, but Director Kincald, who
was the only one to express any interest
in a proposition which affords the only
just way of assigning teachers, moved
that it be taken under advisement for
one week, which was ordered. ." v>;
"When a resolution was adopted assign
ing Miss M. A. Rollins and Miss A. A.
Duffy,- respectively, to the new classes in
the Bernai Heights and Pet 1 body schcois,
Webster said:
"1 do not know the status of these two
teachers and would like to be Informed on
the subject," .
"They are high up on the list," replied
Mark, "practically third and fourth.
Inquiry Bliowed that four teachers pre
cede the two named in the order of
original appointment. They are Miss M.
A. Harrigan and Mrs. J. D. Cooper, Mrs.
C. C. Newhall and Miss A. E. Little. This
evident violation of the priority of service
system is explained by Mark by the state
ment that the assignments were made on
the request of principals.
D. Lambert of the Lincoln Evening
School was granted a year's leave 01
absence and R. L. Mann of the even
ing eligible list was assigned to the class
during his absence.
Superintendent . 'Webster informed the
board that Principal Simmons of the Hor
ace Mann School had requested permis
sion to receive voluntary contributions
from his pupils for the Qalveston relief
funds. Mr. Webster said that the ur
gency of the case needed no comment and
he moved that the board's rule be . sus
pended and the request of Mr. Simmons
be granted. Director Kincald moved an
amendment that the Â» principals of all
schools be authorized to receive such
contributions. The amendment was car
ried, Denman alone voting against It.
Superintendent Webster stated that he
had received a number of requests from
principals for indigent books and hts own
resolution empowering him to distribute
not to exceed $200 worth of the books, in
addition to the $3000 already appropriated,
was adopted. Casserly thought that the

LANDING THE SMUGGLED GOODS FROM^THE STEAMER MONTI

(Concluded.)
BT MARGARET AINSLEE.
After the monopolization by the court
of the productions of the Gobelins, the
looms at Aubus?on were obliged to meet
the more general requirements of the peo
ples {hey were, therefore, protected
against foreign rivals, and have produced
work, good of Its kind, but not as ambi
tious as the panels of the royal tapestry
wea\ - ers.
Although Kngland has been content to
Import rathrr than to manufacture tapes
try, the revocation of the edict of Nantes
and the sacking of Antwerp brought to
her shores many foreign weavers, whose
influence upon English textile is
plainly to be seen In the specimens In va
rious royal palaces and museums. Within
recent years William Morris has made
from designs by Bir Edward Burne-Jones
tapestries which many consider quite
equal In artistic excellence to the best
Flemish weavlngs. Some critics, how
ever, claim that this modern patterning is
too decided, tho anecdote too importunate,
the result too overpowering to tho gen
eral furnishing, and is. therefore, lacking
in the restfulness of the faded storied tap
estry. Certainly Morris did not aim at
the exaltation of the misty In his worsted
frescoes, for he distinctly states that "the
first thing to be considered in the design
ing* of tapestry is the force, purity and
elegance of the silhouette of the objects
represented and nothing vague or inde
terminate is admissible. â¢ â¢ â¢ Depth of
tone, richness of color and exquisite
gradation of tir.ts are easily to be ob
tained in tapestry, and it also demands
that crispness and abundance of beauti
ful detail which was the especial charac
teristic of fully developed medieval art.
Upon general principles, realistic flowers
and modeled figures arc unsatisfactory
and frequently discomfiting, because fig
ure tapestry hangings, like other designs,
must lose their freshness and harmony
by exposure, and when, as oftentimes
happens, the change in flesh tints and
draperies Is not uniform, they present_a
poor appearance; the flutter of a draught
may unsettle the perspective and an inad
vertent fold itay sever a courtier's head
from his trunk. The so-called "verdure"
pieces, however, were but Improved by
the mellowing blend of time. In an old
French work we even find this work rec
ommended as a cheering thing for melan
cholia: "If I were in your place I would
buy a fine hanging of tapestry *de ver
dure.' and I would suspend It In your
daughter's room to enliven her mind and
raise her spirits."
When Louis XIV gave tapestries worth
a small fortune to the Kings of Spain and
Prussia and to the Czar of Russia there
was no lack of occupation for the royal
tapestry looms. Since such commissions
are no longer given, and since the wall
hangings of feudal castles and cathedrals
â tBe "softer echo of stained glass," which
taught its simple lessons of chivalry or
moralityâ have been long since replaced,
first by carved wooden pafteling. then by
stamped leather and recently by color
printed papers, tapestry weaving is grad
ually becoming one of the lost arts, and
unless the old tapestry factories can de
vise a means of bringing about the ex
cellence of medieval work In competi
tion with modern, machine-made products
the doom of this romantic fabric Is In
evitable.
The manufacture of carpets much re
sembles that of tapestry except that (in a
high warp velvet pile) the worsted threads
of the web which form the surface of the
carpet are joined by a double knot on two
threads, of the warp, thus forming on the
face a ring proportionate to the height of
the pile. Next comes the shearing of the
carpet, whose beauty is largely dependent
upon the precision and nicety with which
this last operation Is performed. Carpets
were originally used as table and couch
coverings and draperies, but have been
lowered In use as the cheapened cost of
production has lowered their price. Now
adays the fine old Oriental carpets are
but relics of the fabulous splendor of
Eastern rajahs, who not only adorned
their tents with priceless hanglnes but
had them spread alung the ronda over
which they rode in triumph. Primitive
carpets varied In use and construction,
ranting from thf little square of plaited
reed* uaon which th<> Oriental jeweler
iashions his exquisite gold work, the
woven mat upon which the fakir com
munes immovably with nature or tho rus
upon which the Mussulman utters his
prayers toward Mecca, to the magnificent
pile carpets of I'ersia. whose bold, con
ventional patterns, magnitirent of color,
largeness of mass and vitality of detail
maKe them easily tho finest in the world.
The carpets ot Smyrna are said to be
woven entirely by women's hands. A
traveler in the East sta-tes that as soon as
a little girl can houl a fhuttio she Is al
lowed to have gay colored worsteds with
which to weave upon a primitive loom, set
up by stretching the cords of the warp be
tween two trees. There, with nature for
her teacher, she starts to make the car
pet which Is to be her dowry. Woven with
an inherent love of color and feeling for
the proper continuity of shades, her
handiwork grows to completion a3 she
grows to womanhood. Then appear twÂ»
purchasers, by whom the excellencÂ© of
her lifework Is trstod: one carries away
her tarpet. the ether takes her aa hid
wife.
Oriental carpets may be divided into
three classesâ the Turkish (chiefly from
Smyrna), the Persian and the Indianâ all
producing, from the simplest elements,
rich and harmonious coloring and mar
velous wearing qualities. The mysterious
"hour." or "tree of life," generally form*
the chief motive or center of the Persian
and Indian carpets, and also of the South
ern European textiles subject to Persian
influence. England has given great atten
tion to the manufacture of low-warp car
pets, many of the product3 of her loom
comparing favorably with those of the
Orient. In fact, the manufacture of the
printed and woven carpets of Brusael3
(made at Kidderminster*. Wilton apd Ax
mlnster now contributes largely to the
material prosperity of England.
As a worsted carpet is woven much as a
piece of silk. It will easily be seen that
Jacquard's perfection of machinery by
which the pattern works Itself out under
the hand of the worker, after traversing
the cylindrical holes of many thousand
pattern sheets of pasteboard, has practi
cally revolutionized the?Â© allied arts.
Into the clutches of this democratic ma
chine, invented a hundred years ago. high
art tapestry and all the weavlngs of th*
future are bound to come. The velvet
carpet of Savonnerie, made in imitation
of the Oriental Turkey stitch, was known
as tapestry carpet In the sixteenth centry.
With floor coverings, as with tapestry,
the tone should, bo low, the well-covered
design discernible only upon study, sug
gestive but not Imitative of natural
beauty, conspicuous by its absence of en
deavor after perspective or atmospheric
effect.
An always beautiful textile which, to
an unusual, degree, retains the Old "World
atmosphere, so sadly lacking in our mod
ern manufactures, is tho shawl made In
the Vale of Cashmere. These artistic
woolen shawls are made of wool of tho
Cashmere goat and of camel's-hair wool.
They are woven by the natives on looms

shades, producing a design. A few of the
costliest shawls are embroidered with a
paradise of singing birds, animals and
flowers. Like almost all Oriental fabrics,
they are distinguished by an vinevenness
In design, which, in spite of occasional
confusion, generally produces a unique
appearance of light and shadow, and at a
distance has the effect of low relief.

CUSTOMS INSPECTOR JAMES
CAMPBELL and the smuggled
goods seized on the army trans
port Solace came down from
Mare Island on the Monticello
yesterday. The stuff was piled up on
Mission-street wharf to a height of four
feet, and never before in the history of
the structure has such a valuable cargo
been discharged thore. There were silk3
that would "stand alone," rare vases that
millionaires mlpht covet, furs that a Rus
sian would pay a small fortune for, tea
sets- that cannot be purchased In this
country and laces that would drive a con
nolsseur crazy. All these were piled v up
on the wharf and half a dozen officers
stood guard over them. Later all the
boxes, and there were more than 100 of
them, were sent to the appraiser's store.
Among the boxes that came down on
the Monticello were some addressed to
'â¢Lieutenant II. W. Carpenter, U. S. M. C.
Adams Express office, Washington, D. C."
Three packages were addressed to "Miss
Helen Bryan, 1226 Parallax street. Mount
Adams, Cincinnati, Ohio." One from
lieutenant Hobson of "kissing" fame was
directed to "Miss Annie Hobson, Greens
bro, Ala." Another bore the address "Mr.
W. J. Mclntyre, Evans Block, Riverside,
Cal."
The moet valuable case of all, however,
was one intended to reach "Mrs. George
Richards, care of Hon. R. Q. Mills, Cor
."lcana, Texas." This box contains "loot"
from the city of Tientsin. The man In
charge of the box frankly states that the
stuff was secured from some of the shops
in the Chinese city after the allies had
taken possession.
Then there were cases addressed "Dr.
A. C. Russell, U. S. N., 29 Park avenue,
New Rochelle, New York"; "N. E. Car
penter, 1813 East Seventh street, Kansas
City, Mo.": "Ueutenant A. B. Hoff, care
of J. C. Croley, Westchester, K. Y.VI '"Ft.
O. Morse, Portland. Or."; "D. T. Spur
geon, Seattle," and "Col. R. L. Mead,
U. S. M. C."
When the Solace came Into port here
Colonel Mead "declared" some of his be
longings and paid duty on them. When
the ship was searched at Mare Island,
however, three more cases addressed to
him were found, and these wero seized
and brought to San Francisco.
The stuff taken out of the Solace would
net a small fortune. In every case the
duty Is nearly GO per cent of the value,
and as Undo Sam Is a close appraiser
the chances are that nearly all the curios
will be abandoned to tho revenue authori
ties. In that event many a person who
has been looking forward to a souvenir
of the war in China will be disappointed.

The Mystic Shriners.
A committee Is hard at work petting
the steamer Zealanrlia ready for the trip
to Honolulu on October 7. The Mystic
Shriners. who will make the voyage on
the vessel, are full of enthusiasm and the
vessel will carry the jolliest crowd that
over went out of port when she sails two
weeks from Sunday.
The following committee went over the
Zealandia yesterday In company with
John D. Spreokels. R, r. Hurlburt. B. D.
Pike. -James H. Brown, G, F. Neal and
Joseph H. Goldman. TheEe gentlemen
have r"t a gang of thirty painters and
carpenters at work and the transforming
of the vessel has begun. The Oceanic
Steamship Company is doing far more
than the contract calls for. according to
Mr. Neal, and the ship will be in splen
did order by October 7. She will be pro
vided with new linen throughout and the
upholstering will all be replaced. When
the alterations ere completed few people
will recognize the Interior of the Zealan
dia.
"W. Remensperger, who sailed on the
Australia. Is a representative of the Mys
tic Shriners, and with two others goes to
Honolulu to arrange for the coming of
the Zealandia.
Harbor Commissioners" Meet.
Some of the closest bidding ever seen In
the history of the water front was done
yesterday on the extension and repairing
of Steuart-street wharf. When completed
the structure is to be turned over to tbe
transport service, and warehouses to ac
commodate Uncle Sam will be built in the
vicinity. When the whole scheme is ac
complished the United States Will have
the finest transport facilities In the world.
The bids for the work were as follows:
City Street Improvement Company, $18,-
G43 35; Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Com
pany, $18,742 10; James A. McMahon, $18,
943 50; Darby Laydon. $19,728 29; Hyde Con

Chicago Livestock Market.
CHICAGO. Sept. 19.-CATTLE-Rece!pts. 17..
COO. Including 2200 Western and 1100 Texans.
CHICAGO, Sept. 19.â Wheat was Btrong: and
active all day. To start with there was the
Liverpool advance of %d, wet weather In the
Northwest and a reported advance of 10c per
barrel in flour. Under the influence of this
news October opened %c higher at 78@78Hc
but on a report that there was a prospect of
the weather clearing in the spring wheat coun
try a reaction to 77%c tollowed. After this
dip the tone was strong. Northwest markets
were strong and there was liberal buying here
for the Northwest account. Receipts were
small at Northwest points and the buying was
sa)d to be largely for country people. There
were numerous reports of serious damages from
rains. Offerings in the pit were light and the
outside demand, coupled with the efforts of
ehorts to get out of harm's way, resulted in a
Bharp advane'e. October sold up to 79c, receded
a little and then bulged further to 7D>fec and
closed VWl%c over yesterday at 79Vic.
Corn was dull, but In sympathy with wheat.
October closed unchanged at 3S%c.
Oats were dull and featureless, closing un
changed at 21%@21%c
Provisions were irregular, the tone ! at the
end being rather heavy and, with the exception
of lard, lower In price. The opening was higher
on an advance at Liverpool and a steady to
strong hog market, but the support of shorts
waa lacking and as longs disposed of some of
their holdings the price eased off. October
pork closed l'Hc under yesterday, lard 2%c
higher and ribs 6<37'/4c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Trading In dried frulta was of a hand-to
mouth character and the market continued to
rule quiet at unchanged prices, with 3@5c the
basis for common evaporated apples. 4*i@5>Â£c
for prime. 5H@6c for choice and 6@6',ic for
fancy. California dried fruits were Inactive.
Prunes, 3ViS7c per pound, as to size and qual

on Monday were dislodged, the market came j

The Business Situation.
The NÂ»w Tcrk circular of Henry Clews save:
"While prices and profits on manufactured
artick-s are lower than a year ago there is a
welcome abatement of that feverish activity
In 1S$$, whir-h. If long continued, would have
purely precipitated a. serious rea.ction of some
t-ort. with all the attendant evils of shut
downs, r^du^f'l waxes, etc. That Ruch a
calamity has been averted is cc-rtainly good
r*-abon for congratulation. In place of a sud-
ci-n collapse we have had a gradual decline
In prlci s and moderate curtailment of produc
tion, bo conductfJ as to re-estab'ish rather
than destroy confidence. BradstreefB price in
dex ftrure touched its hlphest on Februarj' 1.
when It stood at S3. 107. Since th<>n there has
tK?en a. continuous decline, thouph lately very
slow, until on September 1 the figure was 86. Â£81;
a decline of 6.526 points. On September l. ISM.
the index figure was 84.784. n that prices in
treneraJ are scarcely 2 pcir.ts higher than a
year atro. Should business revive, as now
Ff-ems likely, it is questionable if the down
ward movement will go any further, paving
where prices in some few instances are eiiii
comparatively high.
â¢'Another very satisfactory Indication cf busi
ness conditions Is the clearing-house returns
from ell parts of the country, except the finan
cial centers., such as New York, Boston, Phila
delphia. Â«c, where, for reasons well known,
the returns show a decrease. For Instance,
during the ei^ht months ending August 31 the
cities included in the Middle West showed a
pain ovrr laFt year amounting to 6.4 per cent;
the West proper a gain of 1S.06: the South a
#rain of U.S. and the J'acific States a pain of
31.7 jw prat. Those figures very plainly demon
strate that the late wave of depression hats
been mainly conHu^i to the Eastâ the section,
it may be noted, which chiefly felt the effects
of the sil\-er eampsicn four years apo. It is
elso evident that the agricultural sect ions cf
the country, vrxyrx which our national pros
pertty ha;- always depended, have held their
lmprovpmrr.t betfr than the industrial or
financial fenters at the Bast, which have Buf
fered fr&m fcisrh prices and excessive produc
tion of both cr.rr.moditles and securities. Vast
quantities of industrials have been put upon
the stock market, to say nothing cf the rail
r"ad bonds and t-tocks which Europe has sent
Ijack on rise; so that the wonder Is the
r.f-pression '.n the f.nanciaJ markets has not
been much preater. Very evidently ioir,e goo<I
judges cf the situation have confidence in thÂ«
future, and this confidence is unquestionably
baaed upon the sound condition of general
business."

NEW YORK, Sept. 19.â The local cotton trade
again manifested little sympathy In the efforts
of the foreign bulls to create a fresh specu
lative enthusiasm on the long Bide and In re
eponse to firm cables our market easily moved
up 1 to 10 points on the call. The advance waa
followed by a sharp turn, and a subsequent
rapid decline which carried prices off IS to 28
poir.ts from the opening bids. Shortly after
midday the market changed completely and
prices worked steadily upward. Speculation be
came less active as the session progressed and
gradually narrowed to professional operations.
The market was finally very steady with prices
3 to 5 points net lower. . .

NEW YORK. Sept. 19.â Tin continues its
downward course, owing to the irregularity
and weakness abroad. To-day's market wound
up with prices below last night's close, with
sellers on the basis of J28 60 and very weak In
tone, the rest of the list developing little if
any new features.

Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
While there have been more manufacturers
represented in the' wool market the past week,
the volume of trade has been again small. Con
sumers are evidently not yet ready to lay in
any large line- of wool, but they are closely
watching the situation and some of them are
taking sample bags which, It Is hoped, will
develop into some fair sized sales before long.
The wool traders as a whole are not making
concessions to amount to anything, as most of
these who have been holding their wool until
the present time are generally determined to
continue to hold until after the election. Prices
on the whole may be quoted steady, general ex
pectation In the trade being that there is not
likely to be much more of a decline here.
Sales of the week In Boeton amounted to 1,650,
000 pounds domestic and 65,500 pounds foreign,
making a total of 1,705.600 pounds, against a
total of 1,455.000 pounds for the previous week
and a total of 9.152,000 pounds for the cor
responding week last year. Sales since Janu
ary 1 amounted to 94,646,500 pounds, against
I0&.043, 100 pounds for the corresponding time
last year.

THE Hall of Justice Is at last some
thing more than a phantom of
what it was expected to be. After
years of preparation, Blow, te
dious and unprofitable, the build-
Ing was the scene yesterday of official
business. After the scandals and squab
| ble of contractors, the pleading and threats
j of citizens, the prodding and commands
; of officials, the building became yesterday
! something of a reality. While ma
sons, plasterers, carpenters, locksmiths
Â¦ and furnishers were filling the corridors
! with varied sound Police Judge A. J.
; Fritz opened court and held trial. It was
I something unusual in the way of an offi
cial opening for a great building.
And it may oe interesting to the student
i of municipal law to remember that the
! shade of Daniel Webster and the._ very
! aggressive. Impudent presence of Yoach
i imatsu Oki gave character to the formal
i opening of our Hall of Justice. There
knew enough to speak and write English
Intelligently. The court decided, however,
that he was not an expert and he was
excused, while the case was continued
until next Tuesday.
The first court session in the new Hall
of Justice was finished, and it will be
some time probably before .the sphere of
Justice is much more , enlarged. The big
building Is still in a condition unfit for
occupancy. There 1b still at least two
weeks' hard work to be done upon Its fur
nishing. The court rooms, Superior and
Police, are practically finished and rep
resent a decided improvement upon any
thing in the City Hall.
The prison on the top floor, however, is
far from being finished. The cells, for
midable, secure, oppressive! and caerelike,
are complete, and if bars, bolts, locks and
combinations count for anything no pris
oner will escape. As a whole, the build
inpr Is the best San Francisco ever had In

Organization Is belns quietly effected
among some of the teachers in the Pub
lic School Department having for its ob
ject the submission of a charter amend
ment providing for the appointment of
non-salaried members of the Board of
Education. The teachers who are the
prime movers in the project are mainly
those who have been legislated out of
their positions for alleged political rea
sons, but they claim to have the support
of nearly all the teachers in the depart
ment. This support is not open, as it la
feared that the further wrath of the
School Board would be incurred if the
members of the board knew of It. For
that reason the organizers decline to have
their names made public.
Nevertheless, the pedagogues hope to
have an amendment prepared for submis
sion at the election next year, when
amendments may be submitted. It is cal
culated that the signatures of the neces
sary 15 per cent of the voters will be
easily obtained. At the present time the
four School Directors are paid JZV) per
month each and are bound by the char
ter to devote all their time to the busi
ness of the schools.
The promoters of the non-salaried plan
for School Directors quote ln their own
support from a report presented to the
last National Council of Education at Los
Angeles, which finds two thoroughly bad
principles combined in one scheme con
tained in the new charter â a bi-partlsan
school board and a i ai.l school board,
the members of which are required by
law to give their entire time to their du

to live up to what the posters said about

The clowns, reddest of all circus peo

made grotesque and plaintive music for

JUSTICE BEGINS HER REIGN IN
HER NEW MUNICIPAL TEMPLE
OAKLAND, Sept. 13.â In secret session
to-day the Board of Police Commission
ers commenced an Investigation of the
charges of blackmail and brutal conduct
made against Policeman Thomas Pardee
by Mrs. A. I). Howe and her brother, Fred
P, Howe. Attorney M. C. Chapman ap
peared for the accusers and Lincoln S.
Church represented Pardee.
It was upon motion of Commissioner
Clement that the henring was held be
hind eloped doors, the explanation being
that the hearing was simply for the Com
missioners to determine whether the evi
dence was sufficient to put the accused
patrolman upon trial. ,
Both sides had been energetic In dig
ging up evidence to present to the board.
All of Pardee's friends on the police force
have born exceptionally active in his be
half, while the Howes have had the ben
efit of all the policeman's enemies could
do to aid them. The result has been lo
very seriously disorganize and demoralize
the men in the department.
The trouble between the Howes and
Pardee has through the various political
animoaitles which have been stirred
aroused a bitter factional warfare in the
Police Department.
Commissioner Dow is accounted as dis
posed to be friendly to Pardee, whom he
named for appointment. The position of
Commissioner Clement is curiously mys
tifying. Clement has not been politically
tied to the faction which has taken ud
Pardee's fight, but his recent votes hav*
been with Dow. Mayor Snow openly
stated the last time Fardee was before
the board that he would not vote to re
tain the policeman In the department if
he should again be brought before the
board.
The defense of Pardeo In the present
trouble Is a direct denial of the Howes'
charges.- Further, he has called many
witnesses who, he maintains, will testify
that Fred Howe Is of bad repute and un
worthy of credence. To offset this Mrs.
Howe has called a number of her neigh
bors to uphold her declaration of good
character.
Among the subper.aed citizens and po
licemen who dangled In waiting at tha
executive session were Mrs. A. P. Howe.

stories to the Commissioners th!3 after

was of good character.

Although weakened by the con-
tinued drenchinj?, fatigue and exposure,
he made the voyage successfully, which
his physician says would have been well
rign impossible, and probably entirelv
impossible, but for Grape-Xuts food.
Having found Grape-Nuts food so won-
derful in its invigorating and nourishing
effects, the captain, upon his return,
scting on the advice of his nhvsician.
continued the uÂ«e of the food, steadily
paining in health and strencth.
" Captiin Blackburn and the nhvsician.
whose name is omitted as a professional
courtesy (a well-known doctor in
Gloucester, whose name can be given
upon application to the Postum Cereal
Co. Ltd.. Battle Creek. Mich.) look
upon Grape Nuts as the most perfect
form of food known, and especially ap-
plicable to the use of those who are sub-
jected to lone continued exertions, fa-
tigue and exposure.
When Captain Blackburn cot to sea
the weather was so stormy and the wa-
ter rough that he was compelled to stay
at the wheel the most of the time and
was unable to run his stove and prepare
food. He subsisted almost entirely on
Grape-Nuts food, which is ready
cooked, and which he poured directly
from the little boxes into his hand or
mouth.
Captain Blackburn, who sailed from
Gloucester, Mass., in a small boat 29
feet over all, for Gloucester. England,
in June, 1899, carried with him, by order
of his doctor, a variety of different
foods, also a little oil stove to prepare
them. Conspicuous atnonc these foods
the doctor nimtd Grape-Nuts.
62 DAYS ALONE ON THE
OCEAN.
Sustained by Grape-Nuts Food.

Deciding courseâ N'ora beat Belle Rocket.
T. J. Mclnerney's Nora proved an easy
stake winner yesterday afternoon at Un
ion Park in the deciding course with Belle
Rocket. H. A. Deckelman's hound was
played well until the last course, when
the bettors, impressed "by Nora's sterling
work during the day, refused to back the
runner-up. The odds were 5 to 1 on Nora
and the score 12 to 2.
From the slips Nora shot out, taking
the lead and several successive turns. At
no time did Belle Rocket seemingly have
a chance for the course, which was a long
but not closely contested one. Nora was
lucky In regard to many of her courses
yesterday, as was another of the Merced
doq*Â», Johnnie R, the latter reaching the
fifth round and being put out by Belle
Rocket, the runner-up.
The day belonged pretty much to the
favorites, but a few startling "dumps"
were registered. Eager downed Moon
stone, a 3 to 1 favorite, and Wag took the
measure of Lady Sears at 1 to 6. In the
second round Beauty Spot. Iowa Boy and
Iowa Maid, all short enders, took the
money. The course between Best Bar
gain and Miss Penman was a surprise to
the wise ones, but not to a number of
tyros who played the former at big odds.
They cashed bunches of tickets when the
red flag waved. Â»
The run down- was as fo-llows:
Few Favorites "Were Dumped â Tyros
at Game Cash on Best Bar
gain Over Miss
Penman.
Merced Dogs Have Luck and
Remaiu in the Stake
Until the End.

warm and the track fast. Fred M was a
prohibitive favorite in the 2:14 pace and

prise of the day. "Wilhelm Melster was
picked to win, but Molo, who had been a
strong second choice, proved to be a
great sprinter and won In straight heats.
Molo'a finish In tha third heat was sen
sational. He broke in the back stretch
and dropped back to sixth place, but
after he passed the three-quarters pole he
went around the bunch and won from
Gale, who looked a sure winner. Daisy J
was the favorite in the 2:19 pace. Mickols
laid up the mare in the first and then went
on and won In consecutive heats. Sum

Dr. J. r.ulBBOA. Bpx lÂ»37,8aa Fr_cÂ£.-0some of the greatest victories over evil?
heavy with antiquated prejudices. Let us
hope that our next victory may be over
the bondage of alcohol. Intemperance is
the besetting sin of our land. It enforces
Itself upon us like a tide. Experience has
proven that it is useless to attempt to
curb the evil by civil coercion. What we
want are laws which shall protect the
community.
"The enemy's works may be taken by
siege as the League of the Cross has car
ried them. The next practical plan would
be to visit doctors and gain from them a
consent to try to abolish liquors from the
houses of their patients."
The young orator likened the temper
ance movement to a rock hurled over a
precipice, gathering momentum as it goes
downward and carrying all before It.
William Weyand dwelt at length on the
Norwegian system of company saloons.
He urged a gradual weaning from liquor.
â¢'With us prohibition has failed," he
declared, "because It would make a man
out of a boy at one stroke of the pen."
While the judges considered their ver
dict. "Billy" Hynes put the audience in
good humor with his laughing song. The
suspense did not last long. On the return
of the jury John M. Burnett addressed
the audience, telling them that all the es
says were of so high a standard that It
had been no light task to decide which
was the best. He then announced the
jury's decision.
"Take this badge more precious than
battles won," said Rev.- Mr. Prendergast
as he pinned the medal on McCarthy's
breast, designating him as a "young ath
lete of Christ."

Mrs. Jennie Wolff, 632 Golden Gate ave
nue, swore to a complaint yesterday in
Judge Cabanlss' court for the arrest of
Etta Birmingham on a charge of petty
larceny. She was a servant in the house
ajid. it Is alleged, stole several hand
painted plates and a quantity of cut glass.
She was for a time doorkeeper for Bosco,
the snake charmer. She has been ar
rested before for stealing from houses
where she was employed.
Taking Qualities of a Domestic
Dr. Wlnslow Anderson discussed the
affair with the greatest reluctance last
night. Professional ethics would not per
mit him. he said, but he declared that
Mrs. N.evills had had a very narrow
escape. While exidences pointed to
ptomaine poisoning practically similar
symptoms would have resulted from
arsenic poisoning.
Whether or not responsibility should be
placed upon the wedding cake no one
knows, but Mrs. Nevills has made a'reso
lution never to enter so thoroughly again
into the loving feasts of her servants un
less she has an absolute assurance that
love among the domestics has run with
something more than proverbial smooth
ness.
However that may be, the wedding was
announced and the wedding cake, a most
ambitious affair, was prepared. The wed
ding supper was to have been served in
the Nevills home by permission of the
mistress, but at the last moment the
servants determined to feast down town.
But the wedding cake was left at home,
and it was of that cake that Mrs. Nevills
and her aunt partook. Soon after both
were overtaken by the most painful ill
ness. Mrs. Nevills was by far the worse
sufferer, as her aunt soon recovered.
And the gossips of neighboring kitchens
shook their heads, for It seemed there
was a love tragedy as well as a comedy
In the servant host of the Nevills home.
The butler appears to have been a
breaker of feminine hearts in a way, and
the happy possessor of enough affection
to shower it upon more than one fair
head. And the gossips said that when he
won the cook, blonde, buxom and blush
ing, he earned the everlasting hatred of a
housemaid..
ing of Mrs. Nevills has been without
avail. On Thursday she and her aunt
went driving and calling and ate nothing
which might produce ptomaine poisoning.
That day had been one of unusual inter
est in the Nevills household. For a day
the affairs of the kitchen ruled the estab
lishment. Cupid had been busy among
the servants and two of them, the cook,
newly appointed, and the butler, had
launched themselves on the waters of.
matrimony.
Tommy Wallace, the notorious crook,
who was convicted of vagrancy by Judge
Fritz was yesterday sentenced to pay a
fine of $T2o! with th* alternative of 120

Mr?. W. A. Nevills. wife of the million
aire, whose name is not unfamiliar to the
public, has Just passed out of imminent
danger of death. She is still seriously ill
at her home and her friends and husband
believe that she narrowly escaped being
the victim of a poisoner, whose motive for
a crime every effort is being made to dis
cover. So convinced are the Nevills that
a crime was intended that Captain Neville
has expressed his purpose to employ de
tectives and sift the sensational affair to
the bottom. Suspicion, but no proof, has
fallen upon the servants' of the Nevills
household and some interesting develop
ments have already been made. It is
feared that Mrs. Nevills owes her danger
ous and almost fatal illness to the heart
burnings and love-longings which find
their center in her kitchen.
L>ate last Thursday night Dr. Wlnslow
Anderson was summoned In haste to the
home of Mrs. Nevills at 22*M Washington
street. The mistress of the house was
dangerously 111. She suffered excruciating
agony and it was evident that she had
been poisoned. Remedies for ptomaine
poisoning were immediately applied and
in a few hours Mrs. Nevills was giver,
temporary relief.
But she was far from being out o*
danger. Her tongue was blistered and
swollen to twice its natural size and the
slightest exertion threw her into agonlea
of pain. She was unable to move and
for a time fears Were felt for her life.
Time after time she swooned in pain and
it was deemed expedient to telegraph to
Captain Nevills, who had gone to Fresno
on business of Importance. He returned
at once to the city and remained until his
wife had passed the danger point, when
he went back to Fresno.
Before going, however, he declared t-iat
he believed that his wife had been ma
liciously poisoned and he would leave
nothing undone to punish the offenders.
Day after day Mrs. Nevills remained In
a precarious condition until yesterday,
when the physician pronounced her out
of danger, although she is still In a very
serious condition.
Every effort to account for the polson-

ROBERT MCCARTHY WINS
THE ARCHBISHOP'S MEDAL
' " ?
Diamond Debate Trophi] Falls to the Young Tem
perance Advocate From the First District,
Rarely has the contest for Archbishop
Riordan's diamond medal brought into j
the field of essays a better lot than those |
contributed last night on "Practical
Plans for Temperance Work." by the
young spellbinders of the League of the
Cross Cadets, whose friends crowded
Metropolitan Hall till there was not room
to move an elbow, to hear their sons or
brothers declaim in friendly rivalry.
There were live contestants this year:
Robert McCarthy of"the First district;
William Wyand of the Second; James P.
O'Brien of the Third; Richard Behan of
the Fourth and Gerald Lawler of the
Fifth. Each of these five had been suc
cessful in his parish contest and later
carried off the silver medal in his district.
Richard Bohan withdrew from the con
test on account of business engagements.
Archbishop Rlordan was to have deliv
ered an address and presented the medal
to the winner, but he was too unwell to
venture out and his place was taken by
the Very Rev. J. J. Pendergast, V. G.
After the essays had been read the
Judgesâ John M. Burnett, Frank J. Mu
rasky and Joseph S. Tobinâ retired for a
short consultation. When they returned
it . was to make Robert McCarthy very
proud and happy. The diamond medal
was his.
The contest this year was exceptionally
Interesting owing to the fact that the
contestants were very evenly matched and
all on their mettle. Applause was liberal
and a general spirit of good natured fac
tionism was In the air.
After a- short introductory speech by
Walter E. Dorn, president of the League
of the Cross, the competitors drew lots
for. the order in which they should de
liver their efforts.
The first chance fell to Gerald Lawler
of the fifth district. He seemed to think
that the remedy for the drink habit lay
in the victims themselves.
"It is moral courage that is wanted,"
declared the orator. "This kind of cour
age displays itself In silent effort."
Then followed James P. O'Brien. His
excellent delivery and clear reasoning was
warmly applauded. He said in part:
"The liquor question should be made a
national issue. To insure its success the
franchise should be extended to woman.
The contest is practically one between the
home and the saloon. Woman's Interest is
centered in all concerning the home."
The speaker recommended the Norwe
gian plan of company saloons modified to
suit American conditions.
"The use of intoxicants has cost the
American nation 1600,000,000 within the
past ten years," he continued, "destroyed
half a million of lives and degraded count
less millions more. It has populated our
insane asylums, orphan asylums and peni
tentiaries, been the mainspring of un
counted murders and made millions of
widows and orphansl We should lend our
earnest support to those who are endeav
oring to remove this foul stain upon our
civilization."
Robert McCarthy then came forward.
His delivery was simple but very clear,
and the applause which greeted him testi
fied to his popularity.
"The present century has witnessed

sohn's march by Bennett's orchestra,
played as the party entered the parlor.
The music continued until after the knot

with chiffon and point applique lace. She

of the bride, wore white lace over rose

The best man was William H. Harrel
son of this city and the ushers were F.
V. Keesling of San Francisco and H. Ha
vens of Piedmont. Mrs. Breeden, mother
of the bride, wore an elegant gown of
broadcloth with bodice elaborately em
broidered with cut steel and black lace
with a touch of black velvet.
Only the immediate relatives and friends
of the bride and groom were present.
After their honeymoon, which will be
spent principally in California, Mr. and
Mrs. Burmister will live in Prescott.

October 17.
THERE was a charming wedding
in the Palace Hotel at 3:30 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, the contract
ing parties being Miss Blanche
Virginia Breeden, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. H. C. Breeden of Portland. Or.,
and Howard Coles Burmister of Prescott,
Ariz., vice president jf the R. H. Burmls
te-r &. Sons Company.
The wedding -was the sequel of a Stan
ford University romance, both the bride
and groom being graduates of that Insti
tution. It was while the two were pur
suing their studies ihere that they first
became acquainted. The bride is a beau
ilful young woman, very entertaining and
popular in Portland society circles. The
wedding was held here so that the uni
versity friends of the young couple might
attend.

â¢ in the Selection of
Talesmen.
Sheriff Lackmann obeyed an order Is
sued by Judge Burnett directing that a
special venire of 150 talesmen be sum
moned that a jury might be secured to
try Peter McQlade with such zealousness
that he must do the work over again. The
Sheriff went the court fifty better, sum
moned 200 talesmen, dismissed forty on
his own motion and returned the names
of 160 to the court for service.
When the McGlade case was called yes
terday morning Attorney Lennon, who
represents the defendant, challenged the
entire venire as . being irregular, more
citizens being summoned than the order
called for. Deputy Sheriff Hare was
placed on the stand to explain why. the
additional talesmen were summoned. He
said the Sheriff wanted to have enough
men on hand to avoid the necessity of
summoning a new venire. Judge Bur
nett, however, informed Mr. Hare that
the court alone had authority to name
the number of men to be summoned.
The entire venire was ordered dis
charged and a new venire of 100 men was
ordered by the court, returnable at 2
o'clock this afternoon.

STANFORD ROMANCE
ENDS IN A MARRIAGE
Miss Blanche Breeden of Portland and
H. C. Burmister Married.
Abbie Rose Wood is again forcing her
claim to recognition as the lawful widow
of the late Josei.h M. Wood- Her ap
plication for a family allowance of $250 a
month from decedent's estate pending the
settlement thereof was argued before
Judpe Troutt yesterday. Judge Belcher.
In a recent decision, held that Mrs. Wood
was not the lawful widow of the deceased
and judicially decreed that their mar
riage In Nevada within one year from the
date of the decree of divorce that released
the Â«jec*Â¦a^eÂ¦i and made his marriage to
the claimant possible was illegal, null and
void. . . â¢
Judge Belcher n?ac!:od his decision In
the action by which Mrs. Wood sought to
recover Jlo.a'Ri on ?.n a.nte- nuptial contract
In which she agreed that for the consid
eration therein staled the would release
all claims *he then had or might have
by reason of her marriage to the proper
ties and estate of Joseph M. Wood.
Though the contract on its face was valid.
Judge Belcher gave judgment against
Mrs. Wood on the ground that her mar
riage to Wood was illegal. Up to the time
of this decision Mrs. Wood had been re
ceiving a rfguiar mor:ilily allowance of
J2uO from the estate. Its announcement
caused a revolt on the part of the chil
dren of the 'irst wife of deceased and
thev refused to pay a further allowance
Â¦without an order of court. Timothy J.
Lvons and Lloyd & Wood, on behalf of
Mrs. Wood, hied a petition for a monthly
allowance of J2jH a month pending the
settlement of the estate. After the dis
tribution of the estate Mrs. Wood will
receive a monthly income of $250 in ac
cordance with the terms of the decedent's
will.
Testimony was taken on the hearing of
the case and arguntent was opened yes
terday. Tirnothv J. Lyons, on behalf of
Mrs. Wood, first addressed the court on
the if-sues involved.
"It is my belief that the policy of the
lawâ and If it Is n<>t it should beâ is to sup
port marriace wherever contracted." he
fald. "Marriage, btir.g the foundation of
society, is a natural right which the
Christian world recognizes can be entered
Into everywhere. It has been beautifully
taSd that marriage is the parent not the
chiirf of society. Marriage is not a right
undfr the lawâ it is a natural right apart
Jrom the law. and the law but governs
Its Folemnizction. That law which pro
hibits marriage within one year after the
eigniryr of the decree of divorce applies
alone to those marriages solemnized
within this State. N<Â» law enacted by the
people of this Suite can provide for mar
riage without this State. The statutes
provide That all marriages recognized as
legal by other States or nations are legal
In California. A judgment of divorce, by
a decision <>f our Supreme Court, like
a judgment in any other case, goes into
effect the moment the court pronounces
its decision. We have a statute which
pays a der-ree of divorce dissolve? the
marriage and restores the parties to the
ftate of unmarried persons. This statute
is absolute and by it the parties are made
'unmarried.' This section prohibiting
marriage of a divorced person within one
vear from the date of a decree of divorce
has nothing to do with anything but the
'validity of marriage.* and as no State is
presumM to refer to any act except that
oorurrlr.^ within its own borders, and
from the fa<-t that the marriage of Jo
prph M. Wood and Abbie Rose Wood is
rt-c-'pr.ized as Ic-gal and valid ii. Nevada
It must be so recognized in this State and
by its courts."
O P. Kvans. who represents th" children
of the deceased, argued that thÂ° prohibit
ory ftatute was a part and parcel of the
divorce decree and was not merely a pro
hibition of the second marriage of the
parties until one year had elapsed after
the decree had been entered. The decree,
Mr. Evans contended, did not become op
erative until the year ha<l elapsed, and
hence the marriage of the claimant to
Joseph M. Wood was invalid.
Next Friday further argument will be
ordered on the carse. Opposing the views
expressed by Judge Belcher are three
opinions â one handed down by Judge Fitz
gerald of Los Angeles, one by Judg Heb
bard of this city and the third by Judge
Lucas F. Smith of Santa Cruz. In a re
cent letter to Mr. Lyons Judge Smith
said:
"I send you a decision made by me that
raay be of service to you and 'consoling'
to The newly married couple? from Ne
vada. I pave the question much study and
the attorneys were so fully satisfied that
I was correct in my construction of the
law that no appeal was taken. I think
voti will reverse my friend Judge Belcher,
who differs from me on the questions in
volved."
Thnush four decision? on the Nevada
marriace question have been handed
down in the Superior courts, none has as
vet reached the Supreme Court on appeal.
Thf- case at bar, hawever. will probably
reach the court of last resort and the
uncertainty that now fills the minds of
many married couples throughout the
Elate will be forever ended.

ANOTHER GAS VICTIM
LIES IN THE MORGUE
Body of an English Mining Man
Found in His Room at Mexi
â¢ can Hotel. â¢
Robert S. Carlisle,- an English mining
man from Chihuahua, Mexico, was found
dead In his bed yesterday afternoon In
his room at a Mexican hotel at 720 Cal'
fornia street. The gas Jet in the room
was turned on full blast and the body
was quite cold when it was discovered by
Guadalupe La.brada, the owner of the
house.
Whether the case was one of suicide
will have to be determined by a Coroner's
Jury. Carlisle had of late been out of
funds and drinking heavily, but telegram?
found among his belongings made it evi
dent that he could get money easily upon
application to his brother In Chihuahua.
One of the telegrams, under date of Sep
tember 7, read in Spanish as follows:
"Yesterday sent money by. express." A
second telegram, delivered yesterday,
after his body had been found, read:
"Yesterday at 6 o'clock Caspar died "
The first message was signed by A. H
de Carlisle, supposed to be the dead man's
brother. The body is at the Morgue.

letter in Arresting Them, but
Lets Them Go.
The Levy family, consisting of father,
mother and daughter, who were arrested
Tuesday nlpht by Policeman Douglass on
a charge of disturbing 1 the peace, appeared
before Judge Conlan yesterday morning.-
The father had spent the night in the
City Prison and the mother and daughter
in the Receiving Hospital, as -Mrs. Levy
was suffering from an attack of hysterics.
The daughter, whose stage name is
Flcrer.re Schafer. explained to the Judge
that she wanted to go to Chinatown, but
i her mother objected, and that was all.
j There was no disturbance and she was
never more astonished in her life than
â¢ when the officer crabbed her and her
! mother by the arm and placed them un-
I df r arrest.
Â¦ Policeman Doupiass testified that ttfey
I were making c-onsideraole noise and at
t traded quite a crowd. He followed them
1 all the' way from Bush and Kearny streets
! to Sutter strÂ«*et and Grant avenue before
' he arrested them. He denied slapping the
i old man. He was corroborated by other
officers.
The Juderp said that the offlcer was per
Â¦ fectly justified In making: the arrests, but
as the defendants had been under arrest
all night he would consider that enough
punishment, and dismissed the cases.
