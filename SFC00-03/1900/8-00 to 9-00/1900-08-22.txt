The reply "of this Government to this
appeal of the Viceroys of Nanking and
Hunan that no Indignities be offered the
Emperor and Empress Dowager is a for
mal acknowledgment of the receipt of the
communication with a satisfactory assur
ance that no Indignities would be offered
the persons of. their Majesties. This re
ply Is couched In the polite language of
diplomacy, but lt ' is understood that It
does not In any way commit the Govern
ment- to refrain from Imposing on the
Emperor and Empress Dowager any pen
alty that subsequently might be decided
upon in case it Is proved that they were
indirectly responsible for the recent atro
cities. This question of fixing responsi
bility where it belongs and imposing any
punishment that may be deemed fitting
has not received formal consideration as
yet. The answer with which the two
Viceroys" appeal is met. accordingly. Is a
diplomatic assurance that the rights ot
the Emperor and Empress Dowager wlh
be protected, but does not impose an>
barrier to a proper punishment, such as>
may be sanctioned by civilized usage fo*
any offense that hereafter may bo held to
call for an "accounting.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 21.-The
Â¦Cabinet session to-day .practi
cally opened the consideration of
the momentous ' questions grow
ing out of the capture of Peking
and 'the war In China. Until to-day's ses
sion the absorbing, question has been the
safety of Minister Conner and the lega
tloners in Peking, j Now, I however, that
has given place to problems of a more In
tricate and far-reaching character, touch-
Ing the existence of the. Chinese, empire
and the part which the American Gov
ernment Is to take In the reconstruction
of that country- -â¢ Â¦ Â¦- â¢
The meeting to-day was devoted entire
ly to the Chinese situation. Secretaries
Hay and Root, who have been most active
in directing affairs, were absent from the
city, so that the attendance was compara
tively small, the President having with
him Secretaries Gage, Hitchcock and Â¦Wil
son and Postmaster General Smith. Sev
eral questions were awaiting ' attention.
First of these was the application of Lt
Hung Chang for. the appointment of Min
ister, Conger or j some other commissioner
to negotiate for the cessation of hostili
ties.
Decision to Reject Appeal. .;_\
The decision arrived " at was to reject
the appeal, and a reply of this character
will be sent to Minister Wu to be for
warded to Li Hung Chang. The moving
cause for this action j Is that this Govern
ment is at present very much in the dark
as to whether there Is any existing Gov
ernment in China. .
With the capital in the hands of the al
lies., the Emperor and Empress Dowager
fugitives in hiding and the entire gov
ernmental fabric paralyzed, there, is no
evidence of an authority adequate to con
duct negotiations and secure results which
will 'be final and binding.
Â» It was stated by members of the Cabi
net "that the Chinese establishment. In
stead of .being a government, 'appears. to
be an enormous . headless affair, without
knowledge of what Is for Its j best, good
and. without; power. to enforce Its wishes,
with" the" recognized ruler in ' flight, and
no one seems to know if anybody Is di
recting its affairs. As China Is an abso
lute monarchy. . without any . executive
branch, the Emperor, and j Empress Dow
ager are all powerful; and practlcally
they are the empire of China.' Under the
present* remarkable conditions the United
States will act -with- extreme Â¦Â¦ caution In
take the same course, at any rate until
Earl IA produces satisfactory evidence of
his authority to negotiate." -â¢
The Dally Chronicle says:
"Mr. Conger has at last opened the eyes
of the State Department- to the real char
acter of the Orientals." - . : Â¦..---.
The Daily Express prints this -morning
a long letter said to have been written by
Vice Admiral Seymour, in which he stout
ly defends his action in advancing to tho
relief of the legatlpners when he did, say
Ing: . -Â¦â¢Â«>Â«
"Two or three times our prospects were
very dark and disaster seemed probable.
Yet 1 never regretted that-I had started,
as I could not have respected myself if I
had not done so."
Referring to the difficulties of controll
ing mixed troops and to their character
istics he savs:
"The Germans we admired most, but
for dash and go none' surpassed or per
haps frjualed the Americans. The French
hed no particular approchement with
othor nationalities. The Germans and
Russians were inclined to hold together,
but the Americans were with us always."
LONDON, Aug., 22. 2:53 a, ra.â In the
news that reaches London this
morning direct from China, there is
nothing to confirm the : report thai
the Empress Dowager has been run
to earth. The foreign envoys, according
to the Shanghai correspondent of thÂ«
Daily Express, are proceeding to Tientsin.
The same correspondent avers that the
sacred city was entered August 15, two
days earlier than Rear Admiral Bruce re
ported.
"The flags of the allies," says the
Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Mail,
wiring yesterday, "are now floating over
the Imperial palace. Street fighting, how
ever continues.
â¢â¢Considerable assistance In the capture
cf Peking was rendered by 4000 armed
native Christians. The legations were en
abled to hold out by purchasing ammuni

posed by the President to answer the note
received to-day and that presented yester

commissioner to negotiate peace in a
communication which will be transmitted
to Minister Wu probably to-morrow.
This communication will show that the
United States desires peace to be brought
again to China as promptly as possible,
but at the same time it will (question the
existence of a government capable of ap
proving the acts of its envoys and having

TEL, WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.-
Senator Stewart's declaration that
he will support McKinley for re
election was not altogether a sur
prise to Republicans in Washington. The
Republicans are none the lea? pleased to
have him declare openly for the . ticket,
especially as they have information that
his statement is to be followed within a
few days by a similar declaration from
his colleague! Senator John P. Jones.
All reports which Republicans are re
ceiving from silver States are encourag
ing." Whether due to the failure of the
Kansas City convention to Indorse tho
nomination of Mr. Towne for Vice Presi
dent or not, the Silver Republican organi
zation seoms to be goins to pieces, and
Senator Shoup of Idaho, who was in
Washington to-day, declared that 30 per
cent of the Silver Republicans In moun
tain States would cast their votes for Mr.
McKinley this year.
HANNA OPENS THE
CAMPAIGN IN NEW JERSEY
NEW YORK, Aug. 21.â Senator Hanna,
chairman of the Republican National
Committee, opened the campaign of. the
Republicans in New Jersey at Asbury
Park to-night. An immense crowd, more
than could be accommodated, gathered in
and about,, the auditorium by the sea
shore. The Senator was roundly cheered
when he entered the building. He was
introduced to the audience by Frank Ap
pleby. president of the Asbury Park City
Council.
Senator Hanna, after thanking the audi
ence for the reception accorded him, said:
We are on the \ eve of a political campaign
fecond Â¦ to none In importance, on the Issues of
which depends the- prosperity of the country.
But I leave the discussion of that matter to
thope who will noon address you.
I want to sound a note of warning to-night
which the importance of the campaign justi
fies. I want to call your attention to the d,uty
before you, not only to individuals, but to the
whole country. This Is a duty that is not
transferable. It cannot be placed on your
nelRhbor. It is your individual duty.
The time is at hand when every man is called
on to contribute what he can. to perpetuate this
administration. It has been demonstrated be
yond any douM" that the policy of the Republi
can party and President McKinley stands for
everything which means the welfare and well
beins of the country at larKe.
You cannot yhirk this duty, because every
man who haÂ» any property must feel that it is<
his fight as much ag any one's and tliat he
must n>ht for his own Interests.
X note of warning is coming from the na
tional Republican headquarters. â¢ I am respon
sible for that, as 1 know the nature cf the
contest which is before us, and I tell you you
cannot afford to take anything for granted or
to miss a trick. (Lautrhter.) â¢ â¢
We are confronted with a dangerous foe and
Bryantsm is in the balance, and if that is
killed now it 13 killed forever. .
I will now quote from one of Governor Roose
velt's speeches recently delivered by him in
which he says: â¢ "Every man who loves his
country Is called upon now to stand shoulder
to shoulder to maintain, the prosperity, which
has given us so much." That is materially
true.
There have been two lessons presented to
the people of this country. In 1892. ; under a
Republican administration, we found ourselves
prosperous, the spindles were all busy in the
factories and Industries were busy on every
hand. Then came a change. The people said
they wanted a change and they got It.
I will not picture to you how labor was then
out of employment and how month after month
it rrew worse. You know all about that as
well as I can tell j-ou.
The people then wanted another changre. and
they got it. And what a change it was and
how the spindles bepan to spin again in the
factories, resulting In happy homes and fire
sides all over the land. >
Nor, do you want another . change and go
back to the conditions that prevailed in 1S97?
(Cries of no, no.) ' i a , ..
Then you mu.Â«t do your duty. I want :sew
Jersey to set an example to the whole coun
try â one that shall be ("ten and recognized all
over the land. (Applause.) Â¦ *
Overconfldence is the worst feature of this
campaign. No one can be blamed for confi
dence In what the outcome will be after three
fc-eara of . President McKinley. but remember
lhat we havÂ« an enemy which may be called
the "cuckoo" party, which Is composed of
men of every shade of political 1 opinion, every
crank and every nihilist. They are all against
us. We must be active and it Is to Impress It
u^on you that I am here- to-night and to tell
you your plain duty. In conclusion, let me say,
you must not neglect it. . â¢ â¢ .

TROUBLE BREWING .IN
POPULIST COMMITTEE
CHICAGO. Aug. 21.â The latest reports
received here indicate that the Populist
National Committee, which is to meet in
this city on the 28th insU may not be as
harmonious as was predicted when the
executive .committee was in session here
early in the month. The meeting is called
for the of selecting a candidate
for the Vice Presidency. When Mr. Towne
declined the. nomination of the Populists
if was generally supposed Mr. Stevenson
would receive the Populist indorsement
by consent. The correspondence which
has taken place among members of the
National Committee of that party since
the executive committee meeting makes
it plain that this result, while apparently
still probable, will not be accomplished
without a struggle. Indeed, it is under
stood that . fnany of the leaders of the
party are strongly urging that the com
mittee shall nominate an independent can

For several months the Webber faction

between the two leaders for political su

late. Corlew has made no effort to get
rat of jail and no steps will be taken to
-ocurf bail for him until it is certain that
I'an Meter will recover.
The wounded man rested easy to-day
ind his physicians now entertain strong
lopes for his recovery. The wound, how
â¢ver. is such that the most critical stage
.vijl not be reached for a day or two at
cast and dangerous complications are
t!!l likely to set in. The medical men
oar that the -wound mav have to be re
pened and in that event, they say, pneu
nonia may set in. There was some in-
but the patient coughed little.
Corlew expresses sorrow for his act and
says he hopes Van Meter will recover.
"I want to see the man get well." he re
marked to-day. When questioned about
the affray, however, he refused to talk,
saying he had no statement to make.
The stabbing affray will probably have
an important bearing on the election of a
Supervisor In the Second District, which
was the sticking point in the "fusion"
bargain.
It is said that If Van Meter recovers he
will refuse to prosecute Corlew. Up to
the time of the encounter Monday morn
ing the men had always been friends.
About three vears ago Van Meter used
his influence with a fusion Board of Su
pervisors to get Corlew a position as head
janitor of the courthouse.
At midnight Van Meter's condition was
without material change. He had a light

blood. Indicating internal hemorrhage.

HAPPENINGS OF THE DAY
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Describes the Events of the Shooting
and His Bow With
, x Kepner.
Charles G. Adams, charged with the
murder of Edgar S. Kepner, took the
stand in his defense yesterday. Adams
attempted to justify the shooting on the
ground of self-defense. The prisoner said
that after Kepner had discharged him he
went away for a few minutes and then
returned for an explanation. Kepner. he
said, cursed him and then suddenly sprang
forward to assault him. "I ran around the
chair," said Adams, "toward the door.
Kepner tried to follow me. and then I put
my hand on my hip pocket and told him
to stop. He Mopped for a minute and
then sprang and threw his arm around
my neck and caught me by'the collar with
the other. .We were . struggling when I
shot him."-
Adams said he did not see anybody come
into the room during the quarrel, and add
ed that he did not feel .'anybody take hold
of his- arm. "They could have pulled my
leg off," he said, "and I 'would not have
known it." Adams also made the fact
plain that he had had. no trouble with
Mrs. Kepner, neither did their acquaint
ance have anything to do with the trou
ble. Adams' story varies materially from
the testimony given by the witnesses for
the prosecution, and ho even denied that
his arm had been seized when he was try
ing to shoot Kepner. Daniel Brooks, who
was called by the defense, testified that
he tried to take the revolver away from
Adams but failed,, and then- Adams shot
Kepner. ' . - '
Argument of the case will be heard by
the Jury to-day, and .a verdict may be
reached before the hour of adjournment.

Been Lured Away.
Harry Corbett's Action in Having
Himself Arrested Is of. No
Avail, as the Case Is ,
Dismissed. <
â - ? Â¦
The poolsfJlers had two hard blows ad
ministered to them In Judge Conlan's
court yesterday.
The first blow came when the case of
Harry E. Corbett was dismissed by the
Judge on motion of Assistant District At
torney AVeller. Attorney Collins objected
to a dismissal until evidence for the pros
ecution was heard. That was necessary
under the charter, he said, and without it
a dismissal would be void, but the Judge
said he would grant the motion of the
District Attorney, and an order was made
to that effect. The poolsellers. hoped to
have settled by that case the value of
their new scheme to receive money in this
city and buy pools with It in San Jose,
but the court would not entertain a col
lusive action. Â¦ '
Judgment was to have ben rendered by
Jud"e Mogan yesterday against Corbett
and William Daley and Walter Mclner
ney who were arrested last Friday night
bv arrangement with .Chief Sullivan and
tf'.ed and convicted Saturday before the
Judge. Mclnerney was not in court when
the case was called. It was. by consent,
decided to continue the case till this
morning and if Mclnerney did not appear
his ball would be declared forfeited and
a bench warrant issued for hla arrest.
The second blow was in the case. of
Henry Schwartz. The prosecution has
been desirous of having the second trial
of this case finished before going on with
any other, but the poolroom men have ap
parently been as anxious to hold it over.
Monday as.it was intimated that when
the case was called yesterday afternoon
Dr. Kahn would appear and testify that
Schwartz was too ill to appear in court,
the Judge said he would get one of. the
members of the Board of Health to see
Schwartz and report as to his condition. â¢
Dr. "W. P. Chalmers was selected, and he
met Dr. Kahn In the courtroom yesterday
morning, when it was agreed they should
both call on Schwartz about 1:30 p. m.
Before that hour Dr. Chalmers received
a mespage by telephone from Dr. Kahn
that Schwartz was not in the city. Mean
time Chief Sullivan had received wfrrd
from Sheriff Mansfield of San Mateo
County that Schwartz was in Redwood
City, as Mansfield had seen him walking
on the streets.
When the case was called at 2 o'clock
Dr. Chalmers was examined and. said he
had received the telephone message from
Dr. Kahn. . Nothing was said to him in
the courtroom in the mornlÂ«g by Dr.
Kahn- as to Schwartz being out of the
city.'
"I consider, this is trifling with the
court." said the Judge, and Collins took
exception to the remark. ,
Attorney Coffey pointed out that at the
time Dr. Kahn's certificate was sent in
last week as to Schwartz's
Schwartz was strong enough to *go before
the â¢ Grand Jury with â¢ his attorney and
make a complaint against Chief Sullivan.
And yet the assertion was made that he
was not able to appear In the Police Court.
He considered a gross imposition was be
lngr-perpetrated V on r' the -' court/ and he
moved 'that Schwartz's bond 1 be declared

Henry Schwartz Is Accused
of Trifling With the

Utilities Committee Recommends Pur
chase by City â Report on Offer
of Lighting System.
The Supervisors' Public Utilities Com
mittee accepted an option last night for
the purchase of the plant which Is to be
constructed by the People's Mutual Tele
phone Company. A resolution thereon
will be presented to the board next Mon
day. The option is to begin five years
from the date of the completion of the
plant and is to continue ten years. Presi- !
dent Crittenden of the company stated
that he would have a contract drawn up
and the City Attorney will be asked to
pass on the validity of the document.
The offer made by the company states
that the price to be paid for its franchise
rights and interest and other property
shall be a sum of money upon which said
company is at the time of the exercise of
the option and right of purchase earning
a net income of 6 per cent per annum.
The committee decided to recommend
for favorable consideration by the board
the offer made by A. Brooke Itidley on
the part of Eastern capitalists to cor.
struct an electric plant to be purchased
by the city at the end of twenty years for
the sum of J294.000 per year. The plant
will have a capacity of 3000 arc and 4(HK>
Incandescent lights and will cost Jl.OOO.C*)
to build. Supervisors Reed. McCarthy
and Dwyer voted In favor of the propo
sition. Connor, the fourth member of the
; committee, while expressing himself In
j favor of municipal owne.rshlp of public
utilities, voted against the recommenda
tion. He argued that the installment plan
of the proposed system did not commend
Itself as he thought that the city was
'rich enough to pay for it at once.
The committee decided to invite a rep
resentative of the Pacltic Telephone and
Telegraph Company at the next meeting
for the" purpose of taking Borae action rc-
I gardlng the telephones now used by tho
I city. The appropriation was reduced by
the board from $15,000 to $7000 for the pres
ent fiscal year and the company threatens,
in a communication to Chairman Reed, to
take out all the telephones Including those
of the Fire Department so as to bring
I the cost down to the reduced appropria
! tion.

forfeited and a bench warrant issued for
his arrest.
Collins objected to the bonds being de
clared forfeited and a bench warrant Is
sued, and asked that Dr. Kahn be allowed
to go on the stand and testify as to
Schwartz's condition. . Â» Â¦
The Judge refused to hear Dr. Kahn and
made "the order declaring the bonds for
feited and for the issuance of a bench
warrant for Schwartz's arrest. The jury
was also discharged and a new venire for
fifty talesmen issued. The case will come
up again this morning to be set, when it
is expected Schwartz will be present, as

Â¦tatlOsa have been erected and every
thing will be in readiness for the opera
tion of the cable as soon as it has beeiÂ«
laid on Its ocean bed.
"Conditions beine normal, we expect to
lay the cable In fÂ«iur days," said Ft. D.

clared that his client had embodied his
unverified petition for letters of adminis

Court and had therefore made the petition
a part of the affidavit. "It is not con
templated by the law." said the attorney,
"that a petitioner must place himself in
a position where he may be indicted by
a Grand Jury for perjury."
Attorney Gunzendorfer insisted that th-j
writ of prohibition should be made per

of his rights by Judge Dunne In not re

"But you neither favor nor resist this

Chief Justice Beatty in surprise.
"I favor it." was the reply, "as I believe
that my Interests would be jeopardized if
I did not."
Attorney Hassett spoke briefly, but drew
forth no new ideas on the subject and the
cape â¢was submitted. Later in the day the
court rendered its opinion, discharging the

attorney was called to this vital omission
by the court, and the astonishing answer
was mr.de that the i*-titioner was not
forced under the law to place himself in
a position wherÂ» he could be indicted by
a Cirand Jury for perjury.
The attorneys for Mrs. Murray had sub
jx-naed Townsrnd with a purpose of in
ducing him to swear before the court that
he is the surviving husband of Mr.Â«.
Townsend. The old man was not asked
to do so. however, ami Attorney Matt
Balllraa declared that if he had done so
he would immediately have been arrested
on a charpe <>f perjury. This illustrates
â¢with what lilttf llifi the case is prvKr^s-

already the iquafcble for her fortune, is
drifting in its eaxrer sweep toward the

Price Illegally Disrated.
City Attorney Lane advised the Board
of Police Commissioners yesterday that
the former board did not have the power
to Impose the penalty of disratement
upon Lieutenant of Police William Price.
After quoting the law bearing on the
subject Lane says:
The only fair conclusion that can be drawn
in that it was the purpose of the State Legis
lature and of the Board of Supervisors to
ro limit the powers of the Police Commission
that an accujifrl officer nhould either be ac-.
quitted, nisDended or removed.
ThÂ« power to degrade was not expressly
given, and if there In any authority for imply
ing such power I have not discovered it In thÂ»
su:r;'Â«-!<ed cases. A case derided in the Xew-
York Court of Appeals held. that removal does
not include disratement. Tfte same court hell
that the power of removal do^s not lncludo
the Dower to suspend. And in Waldorf va.
Police Commissioners. 140 N. T. 473. it was
held that the Commissioners had the power
to remove for cause but did not have power to
create a new rank or gra<!Â« with lower salary
and asstrn the relator (Waldorf) to such new
rank. These cases go principally to show how
Â¦trlctly the courts construe statutes of this
character. The courts uniformly lean awar
from a broad tnd liberal construction of such
statutes and they refuse tÂ« Imply powers not
essential to those expressly rranted.
It certainly cannot bÂ« said that there Is ab
solute necessity that a Board of Police Com
missioners should hav" the power of dlsrate
ment: Indeed, it la a matter of doubt if the
present board has such power.

I R open defiance hurled at it by W. J.,
familiarly known as "Pop," Sullivan,
proprietor of the Hoffman Houso cafe and
grill room, by his refusal to comply with
the? board's order regarding the closing of
side entrances, and after a short hearing
last night it ordered Mr. Sullivan to close
his saloon at once.
A "report against the Hoffman Cafe
was then read, but on the announce
ment that the proprietor was out of town
the case was laid over.
I^ater Sullivan entered the rooms and
asked for a hearing. He apologized for
his tardiness and said that on his re
turn from an outintj he found a. subpena
awaiting him and had come to answer It.
After a few preliminary questions he was
asked why .he allowed his side entrance
to be kept open contrary to the conditions
of tho granting of his license. For awhile
he argued that there were no conditions
to blB license, but at last came out bluntly
and declared that "others are doing- It
and I want the same privileges." This
answer started Judge W allace again, and
he addressed llr. Sullivan in such a way
that there could - be no mlstaklne his
meaning 1 .
"Mr. Foster gave just such an excuse
a short while ago," said Wallace, "and
when asked to cite. an instance, he failed
to do so. I- can see nothing: but a dip
obedience of the law In the keeping open
of your side entrance. I think you, as
well as ethers, should comply with the
ordinance, and I will make a motion to
that effect. I move, gentlemen, that this
place be closed."
Commissioner Xewhall asked Sullivan
why he defied the board, and Sullivan re
plied that while ho wished to obey thÂ«
iav,* he desired the same chance that
others ha.1 in the premises.
"What business is it of yours," broke
In Wallace, "if we grant a continuance
for a week or two In some cases? This
board has endeavored to act fairly and la
not given to making harsh rulings against
any one. We do not act hurriedly to hurt
any one. You are violating the law. Mr.
President, my motion is before the board."
The Hoffman Closed.
Then Mr. Xewhall called for a vote.
There was a response to the call for ayes,
but no answer for the noes. After the
announcement "It Is so ordered" was
made all was silent In the room. Xewhall
broke the quiet by saying, "That is all,
Mr. Sullivan." ,'

832 Market St.Highest Award Paris Exposition.
The San Francisco office of Wyckoff,
Seamans & Benedict, manufacturers and
owners of the Remington Standard Type
writer, received a telegram yesterday
from their main office In New York saying
that the Remington Typewriter had won
the diploma of Grand Prix, the highest
award of the Paris Exposition. There
were live awards grantedâ first. ine
Grand Prix," sometimes called the Di
ploma of Honor, which is granted for ex
ceptional merit only: second, sold medal:
third, silver medal: fourth, bronze medal;
fifth, honorable mention.
A new phase of the millmen's strike de
veloped yesterday, .when F. V. Meyers,
Stato Commissioner of I.abor,. visited a
number of the large factories and ordered
a 1 better enforcement of the law regulat
ing the employment of minors. The Com
missioner's visit was a surprise to some
of the mill-owners. It was claimed that
several mills were employing boys under
age, while older ones -were required to
work longer than the law permitted.
These stories reached the ears of the
'Commissioner, hence' his agility yester
day. At each mill visited by the Com
missioner the owner was left .with a copy
of the act regulating the hours of labor
and employment of minors. The mill
owners' attention was called especially to
section 3, which says that "every person
or corporation employing minors under
16 years of age In any manufacturing es
tablishment shall post and keep posted In
a conspicuous place In every room wherÂ»
such help is employed a printed notice
stating the number of hours per day for
each day of the week required of such
persons." The law also provides that the
name of any minor under 16 employed
shall be kept In a book, which must be
produced upon request of the Labor Com
missioner.
It Is stated there may be one or two
prosecutions as a result of Mr. Meyers'
investigations.
The mill-owners are to meet this even-
Ing, but according to a prominent mem
ber "only routine business will be trans
acted." Asked If the association would
take any action on the resolution of the
builders recommending that the Mer
chants' Association take steps to arbi
trate the trouble, the owner replied:- "We
have received no notification of any such
resolution. All we know is what we have
seen In the papers. If the Millmen's As.
soclatlon wants to arbitrate tho matter
It can find Its own arbitrators. We have
nothing to arbitrate."
This looks very much as if the settle
ment of the trouble between the owners
and employes was as far distant to-day
as it was two weeks ago.
William Crocker wns asked If he could
explain why the Trades Council indorsed
so promptly the plan to arbitrate, and he
answered with a smile:
"If I am not mistaken. It was the labor
organization that originated the idea.
They knew what was coming, while we.
of course, only suspected it. No. there
will be no arbitration by the Merchants
Association in so far as we are con-
Câ¬?rnccl '*
The strike has already caused a depre*.
sion in the building trade, which is being
felt more and more every day. The elgh..
hour mills are rushed with work, but the
general effect of the trouble is depressinR.
Manv contractors, rather than have any
trouble by accepting material from nine
hour shops, are deferring their work as
far as practical, pending a possible speedy
settlement of the trouble. ,

who made the arrest, had their suspicions
turned to Gonzales from the fact that up
to last Friday he had been going, around
the "tenderloin" 1 shabbily dressed and
without any money. Friday night he was
dressed to perfection and was spending
money lavishly. They ascertained that
he was living with a woman at the Dun

made arrangements with Policeman Kent

to meet him at the corner of O'Farrf.H

pretext that he wanted to see him about
a man who also lived in the" Dunlap
House. Gonzales was there on time and
Hess, who was with the sergeant and
McQuald, at once recognized him as one
of the two men who held him up. Gon

of the two,; held the revolver at his head
while Gonzales went through his pockets

valued at $100. Hess lives at S13 Oak

home after buying some tamales for sup

finding any trace of the diamond studs

either sold or pawned them they expect
to recover them vat any moment. They

STUBBS DENOUNCES THE
ISTHM^N CANAL PROJECT
CHICAGCMAug. 21.â The construction of
an isthmain canal was vigorously de
nouncd here to-night by J. C. Stubbs,
third vice president of the Southern Pa
cific, at a banquet given by the National
Association of Merchants and Travelers.
His argument was that the opening of
such a canal would hurt the ship-carrying
trade of the United States. Mr. Stubbs
asserted that the United States would dig
the canal at an expense of $130.000,0u0 to
$200,000,000 and would then be obliged to
hire English. Gorman and French ships to
carry the nation's commerce through it.
The United States, he said, would be
mortgaging its resources or taxing its
citizens to make a highway for the ships
of rival nations, inasmuch as Great Brit
ain and Germany are the strongest com
petitors of the American manufacturer in
the markets of the world, and these two
nations own more than two-thirds of the
world's steam tonnage available to over
sea commerce, while the United Stages
owns less than 5 per cent.

goes on to show how painful to him is the
eituation resulting from it, since he can
not oppose the propaganda.
Leo recommends that the Cardinal Vicar
strengthen the work of preserving: the
faith, and he exhorts Catholics to unite
in an effort to minimize as far as possible
the damage caused by sectarian propa
ganda. ;

PRELIMINARY REPORT
ON ALASKAN BOUNDARY
Sp%clal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.â A preliminary
and verbal report was made to Assistant
Secretary Adee of the State Department
by Otto H. Tittman, Assistant Superin
tendent of the Ccast and Geodetic Survey,
who has just returned from Alaska, where
he went to establish the provisional
boundary line between Canada and Alaska
as specified in the recent modus vivendi.
Mr. Tittman explained to Mr. Adee pre
cisely where the lines had been run. He
is engaged in the preparation of a detailed
report on the subject which will be filed in
the near future. He made the statement
to-day that the maps which were used in
the negotiations which resulted in the
modus vivendi were exactly correct and
that the lines he had established by sur
vey corresponded exactly to those Indi
cated in the official maps which he had
taken with him.
The Supervisors' Committee on License
and Orders decided yesterday to report in
favor of the passage of an ordinance pro
viding that the hours of labor for laundry
employes should be from 6 a. m. to 7 p. m.
Clerk Russell was directed to draw up the
bill for presentation at the next meeting
of the Board of Supervisors. Action was
taken as a result of petitions filed by
Labor Commissioner Myers and the San
Francisco Labor Council. The committee
realized that the prevailing hours of em
ployment were excessive and worked a
hardship on 2000 employes. 65 per cent of
whom were women and children.
S. Bosq. owner of a French laundry,
supplemented the petitions by stating that
KM) French laundry workers favored
shorter hours, as under present conditions
they were obliged to work from 6 o'clock
in the morning until 11 and 12 o'clock at
night.
Labor Commissioner. Myers was heard
in favor of the ordinance, and said that
all the principal laundries and some of the
smaller ones were notified to be represented
at the meeting of the committee. The ab
sence of their representatives he took to
mean a tacit acquiescence to the proposed
ordinance. Public safety and repose Jus
tified the measure, he said. The courts,
he thought, would decide as a sanitary
measure that the hours of labor In laun
dries should be restricted. The gases and
steam he held to be prejudicial to health.
William Madden contended that evidence
should be heard from men engaged In the
laundry business as to the sanitary aspect
of the case. He claimed that the sani
tary end was regulated by the Board of
Health. J. P. Verges also spoke in opposi
tion to the ordinance. Â¦Â¦.'..
The committee will report adversely to
the protest against the ordinance impos
ing a license of $50 on house movers and
raisers. The protestants were heard, but
It was decided that the ordinance should
stand as a measure of safety.

SHORTER HOURS
FOR EMPLOYES
OF LAUNDRIES
L. E. REYNOLDS.
F. Is. LYLE.
FL. LYLE. an electrician In the em
ploy of the Independent Electric
c I-ijjht and Power Company, had
an experience yesterday which he
will not soon forget. He was "engaged in
laying wires in a conduit at the corner
of Clay and Sansome streets, when h's
*vork was suddenly interrupted by a horse
falling through the open manhole. He es
caped the flying hoofs of the frightened
anJmaJ by crouching: in his uncomfortable
quarters. But for some heavy pipes
above his head the beast might have
crushed him to df-ath. As it was. lie was
unal'lo t<Â» get out of tile hole until the
anjmai had been jiiaced out of its misery
hy policemen.
The accidtnt was a peculiar one and the
escape from death of the men at work
In the manwhole was miraculous. H. C.
Wentworth, who resides at 1751 Fifteenth
street, and is employed by tho Mission
Horse Market, was driving two spirited
horses along Sansome street .about 10
o'clock yesterday morning. When he
reached the corner of Clay and Sansome
one of the horses became frightened at
the. rÂ«Kl Hag which was placed close to
the car track as a warning to teams and
passersby that danger was In their path.
The frightened animal reared on its feet,
and despite the efforts of his driver broke
loose from his traces and began to ma
neuver around the open manhole. Pedes.
trians sprang forward to quiet the mad
dened steed, but before they could grasp
its bridle rein its hind legs slipped
through the aperture. S. E. Reynolds,
chief inspector of the Electric Light and
Power Company, was examining the
wires at the time, and escaped from the
place of danger not a moment too soon.
Lyle was less fortunate. He squeezed hi*
body Into the smallest shape possible ano
for ten minutes avoided the flying hoofs
of the animal and prayed for deliver}'
from death.
The horse slipped Into the hole and
within a few minutes nothing could be
seen of the animal but his head. Th*
faj^t that a man was beneath the horse
spurred rescuers on to renewed efforts.
Ropes were passed beneath the strugglln%
horse and an effort was made to pull him
out. but without success. Police Officers
Jamef J. McShane ajid R. P. de Guire ap
peared on thr scene. Despite the protes
tations of the owner of the horse and the
meddling crowd. McShane flred two shots
at the animal. His bullets did not do ex
ecution, because the crowd persisted in
jostling him and holding his arm. Ofllcer
de Gulre tried his hand with better suc
cess. The bullet from his revolver pierced
the horse's brain and placed it out of his
misery.
It was only until then that Lyle could
escape from his peril. He was congrat
ulated all around for his fortunate es
cape. But for a water and gas pipe above
his head the horse might have crushed
him to death. As it was, the pipes pre-
vented the horse from dropping on him,
but gave him greater anxiety.
When Lyle recovered from his nervous
ness, he told of his narrow escape from
drowning and asphyxiation. He was in
the hole for about ten minutes, and hÂ«
paid it seemed like four days to him.
When the horco began to slip toward hinv
he crouched out of danger, but when the
frightened steed in his struggles to re
gain freedom bÂ«gan kicking the pipes hÂ«
became frightened. Lyle said he expect
ed any minute to be covered by water or
asphyxiated by gas which would pom
from the pipes. He agrees that It was
the narrowest escape ho has ever expe
rienced.
The dead animal was lifted out of the
hole late in the afternoon with a derrick
and was removed to the boneyard.

debility, and convalescence following certain
diseases, such Is the lowered standard of tha
vital processes that the function of no organ Is
perfectly performed, and with the resulting de-
pression the patient has a REAL weakness.
The physician's first thought, under these con-
ditions, la nerve and other tonics.
Not Weakness â
Symptoms!
By far the greater number of patients, how-
ever, seeking relief for so-called ""Weakness" is
furnished by healthy and robust men. On ex-
amination, we find a Prostate Gland which has
been damaged by either a contracted disorder
or early dissipation. These patients hava no
weakness at all. Prematureneaa, Loto of Vital-
ity, etc., are the symptoms, or disordered func-
tlun. of the chronically Inflamed prostate gland.
We find by curing this Inflammation that full
vlgror at once returns. It should bt understood
that tonics, electricity, etc.. might <rure a real
weakness, but would do harm tn Inflammation.
The main object Is to rediicw ;fc* size of the
tender, swollen and Inflamed urottate. This wa
accomplish by local treatment, thus avoiding
drugs. Men who hare unoncc*fsfÂ»Hy treated
for a weakness should now understand tha
cau?e of failure. We send frâ > on application a
colored chart of the organ* which will be found
useful In borne dtairnoffla and tntÂ»r*st!n7 to all

Charles Tovvne, the Populist, intends, it is said, to

The simple title "Madame," reduced in
practice to "Jla'am," is, as 'most people
know, all that Serves between Queen Vic
toria and her court to mark the former's
dignity as the ruler of a world-wide em
pire. Had Britain a King he would be no
more than "Sire," the old French- form of
"Sir,", sacred to royalty. With us the terra
"your Majesty" is only for servants and
ceremonial occasions.
There .are .few other courts where this
wholesome. simplicity prevails. The Em
peror of Germany is "Majestat"â there is
no pronoun in the titleâ to all and sundry,
even to his family, except :when in abso
lute privacy. The Emperor of Austria is
"Eurer Majestat" at all times and under
all circumstances: -the.: King of Greece is
"Votre Majeste"-:French being the co\?rt
languageâ and our recent visitor, the King
of Swtden, is- "Ers Majestat." Their

CALIT0R1TCANS IN NEW YOKE.
Such being the course of things in New York and
in Boston, it is hardly worth while for Chicago to
fight. The man in his shirt sleeves may yet prove
himself the king pin in the city as in the hayfields
arid the^ shirt-waist youth be a worthy beau for the
shirt-waist girl. '
It is to be noted that the fight for the preservation
of the coat is waged mainly in Chicago. New York
appears to have -surrendered willingly to the shirt
waistâ indeed, it said she has even welcomed it as a
thing altogether lovely and more to be desired during
midsummer than a coat of many colors. The Boston
Herald, in recording the progress of the reform move
ment, said recently: "Judge Garrison of the Supreme
Court of New Jersey appeared on the bench arrayed
in a pale blue negligee shirt, white duck trousers,
turned up at the bottom and supported by a belt, rus
set shoes and a flowing silk neck scarf. Frank Dam
rosch, at the suggestion of the women of the chorus,
removed his coat while conducting a rehearsal, and
it is reported that W. K. Vandcrbilt dined publicly at
the Waldorf-Astoria coatless. It has also been re
ported that the Waldorf-Astoria would never
the innovation. But, if the hot weather of last week
had continued, few persons or institutions could have*
held out against the comfortable custom. The cafes
of the Normandie, the Herald Square, the Vendomc
and the Marlborough hotels were frequented on all
the warm evenings of last week by uncoated males.,
It will be hardly surprising if the fad becomes a gen-i
eral rage in the next hot summer." '
THE MAN WITH THE SHIRT WAIST
CLEARLY the controversy between the man in
the shirt waist and the established authorities
in the East is becoming serious. Several times
have men without :oats been ejected from dining
rooms, and the conservatives have rejoiced; but now
the shirt waist male has turned. He has shown a
pluck worthy of his cause, and one of the swell
restaurants of Chicago will have to* go into court and
show why it presumes to exclude the coatless man
from its halls. The damages asked are $50,000, and
while that seems an excessive amount to ask for so
small a wrong as that of refusing to serve a wayfarer
with viands at fancy prices, it is perhaps none too
much for the dignity of the occasion.
In our opinion the United States and Europe may
wcli afford to respect the position and the opinions of
Japan, for it appears that peace, international right
eousness and the prosperity which fellow lie that way.
Japan comprehends all t!m and is anxious that
Chinese polity shall be undisturbed and Chinese terri
rory undivided. At the same timejapanese statesmen
rce the necessity of guarantees by China that shall
leave the Western nations without excuse for carrying
cut their territorial designs.
The Western rations have not duly considered the
difference between I be Chinese and other Asiatics.
The people of India, while composed of many races,
had their master motives and their genius from the
philosophic Hindoos, whose belief was that if they
did not cultivate the defensive arts and let others
alone they would be undisturbed. The Moguls
found them thm*bre nn easy prey, and themselves,
with their millions of non-resistant subjects, in turn
fell an easy prey to' Great Britain. But it is a mis
tcke to think that the Chinese are like the East In
tlians. They are not :<vcrfe to the arts of offense and
defense, and they comprehend, . as no other people,
the value of passive resistance.
The government of half a billion people, stubborn
iri an circient civilization, their moral order main
tained through the 'cachings of a philosophy of life
that has not been excelled by any developed by the
Â¦Western rr.ind. is a matter of the first importance. It
cannot be divided between nations that accept dif
ferent and more modern standards, which, perhaps,
have nothing but their juniority to boast.
Over this is the shadow of the secret ambitions of
England. Her peculiar diplomacy has warranted
suspicion*: of her frankness, and her assertion of in
dependence in the Yangtsekiang ValJey makes the
position of the United States and Japan very uncom
fortable.
Mcrh lias been said about the trusteeship 'of the
United States in certain things that interest mankind.
All parses .it I'ome may well agree that this trustee
ship is no myth, when the integrity of China is in
volved.
Japan sees in the partition of China the final de
struction of her own integrity. In the selfish design?
of Europe there is no room for such sentiment toward
Japan as she would have a right to expect, as the re
falt Â«f her cordial action with the allies. By the
latest reports, if they be trustworthy, it again seems
to be the fact that the United States, Great Britain
and Japr.n must ftand together, if the-great evil of a
forced change in the Chinese polity is to be averted.
It is evident that in this policy Russia had in mind
only the outwitting of the rest of Europe and evening
np her own humiliation that followed the treaty of
Berlin, by which Europe snatched from her the pres
tijre nnd advantage of heir triumph over Turkey. The
result has been the transfer of the controversy from
the Bosphorus to China, where a serious collision
may be precipitated at any moment.
JAPANESE troops have sustained a most credit
able, courageous and praiseworthy part in the
movements of the allies for the relief of the for
eigners in Peking. The Government .of the Mikado
has conducted itself with discretion and promptness,
and his naval 2nd military forces have proved more
than equal to every demand made upon them. It
may now be seen more clearly than in the atmos
phere of the event, that much of the recent and exist

PERSONAL MENTION.
UNIQUE summer house is being
II built for Millionaire J. B. Haggin
K\ upon his Elmendorf stock farm, in
Fayette County, Central Kentucky.
It will beconstructed of steel, stone
and brick, like the most modern New York
City skyscrapers, and yet it will be a per
fect reproduction of a beautiful old South
ern colonial mansion, with broad verandas
and porticos and massive pillars extending
to the roof.
But the pillars will be of steel, painted
white, and the brick and stone walls will
be covered with white stucco, and thus
the modern fireproof construction will be
kept in harmony with the eld architectural
design.
This up-to-date Southern mansion will
cost, ft is said, more than $100,000. It will
he two stories high in addition to the
basement, and the walls will be twenty
two inches thick. The interior will be fin-
ished in hardwood of the finest qualities.
The contracts were let last week, but it
will be many months before the beautiful
home Js completed.
Mr. Haggln la reported to have pur
chased Melro3e farm this week, and if
this is true he now owns. In one tract
about S00O acres of the finest blue grras*
land in Kentucky, much of it in woodland
and beautiful rolling pastures. He Is tha
largest land owner in Fayette County.
?
IT IS BEING BUILT OF STEEL, STONE AND BRICK. LIKE A MODERN CITT SKY SCRAPER, AND COV- 4,
:red with stucco to harmonize with the old colonial design, it will, cost over noo.ooo.
Such a feat ranks with the best that has ever been
performed in the gathering of war news. It is an
other demonstration that legitimate journalism has its
sensations more impressive than anything the yellow
journals develop in the way of fakes. The old adage
that truth is stranger than fiction is illustrated in this
swift gathering of news in the heart of- beleaguered
Peking, amid the very confusions of battle, and trans
mitting it promptly to the people of America and
Europe so anxiously waiting it. The fictions of the
fakers can give alleged "interviews with the Empress
of China" and all that sort of thing, but it takes enter
prise, money and energy to send courageous and re
liable correspondents to the scene of action and ob
tain the facts of the situation.
; By obtaining this important news so promptly un
der circumstances of such difficulty, The Call and the
Herald have achieved one of the most signal of the
recent triumphs of journalism. It was not until the
afternoon of August 14 that the Americans and the
British succeeded in forcing their way into the city by
a gate near the legations, and the Japanese did not
enter until midnight. Yet in the short space of time
that has followed, the correspondent of The Call and
the Herald saw both the United States and the British
Ministers, had interviews with them, gathered accu
rate information of the whole situation and forwarded
the news at once to Shanghai, whence it was dis
patched by special cable to New York and to San
Francisco.
In New York and the East the Herald had this
news exclusive, but owing to the difference in time
between the hour of newspaper publication in this
city and that in New York, two of our contemporaries
were able to have the Herald's story telegraphed to
San Francisco early enough for them to publish it at
the same time with The Call. Both of them profited
by that opportunity, but they dealt with it in dif
ferent ways, each after its' kind. The Chronicle
honestly gave credit for the news, but the Examiner,
true to its habitual practice of enriching its fakes by
stolen news as often as possible, republished the dis
patch without giving credit or making any acknowl
edgment of the source from which it was received.
ONCE more The Call and the Herald have
demonstrated the superiority of their service in
the world-wide domain of news-gathering.
Throughout America and Europe there has been the
keenest eagerness for direct news from the besieged
legations in Peking, arid that news was furnished yes
terday by special cable to The Call and the Herald.
It included, along with an account of the situation
generally, an interview with United States Minister
Conger and another with the British Minister, Sir
Claude Macdonald, thus giving to the public infor
mation direct from the highest sources. This was the
first news from Peking and the first interviews with
the Ministers;

NEW KENTUCKY HOME
FOR J. B. HAGGIN
It is figures like these that have given Bryan a
notion to shift the campaign from his much-lauded
Taking the figures as returned to the board the
total value of assessable property in the State this
year is $1,218,228,588. Last year the amount was
$1,194,000,000. The increase is notable in the more
populous counties, but is shared generally by almost
all sections of the State, except in some of the mining
districts.
In California the advance of prosperity ever since
the overthrow of free trade and free silver has been
continuous and steadfast. The wealth of the State
has augmented from year to year at an encouraging
ratio. Evidence to that effect can be perceived on
every side. Its latest manifestation is in the returns
of the County Auditors to the State Board of Equali
zation. In nearly every county in the State these
returns show an increase in the assessed valuation of
property, and it is quite possible the Equalizers may
add to the increase in some of them, so that the total
will be even higher than appears upon the returns:
PROSPERITY m CALIFORNIA.
WHEREVER the Bryanites go this year to raise
their howls of calamity they will find it neces
. sary to make their talk vague as well as dismal.
It will be impossible for them to specify any industry
that is not more' flourishing than it was in the days
of Democratic supremacy, or any State where there is
not now a more abundant prosperity than there- was
four years ago when Bryan made his first appearance
as a candidate for the Presidency.
About the same date in August as the publication
of Valentine's letter, the Examiner said: "With
Manila in our hands by right of conquest, it becomes
more than ever impossible to withdraw the Amer
ican forces from the Philippines^ The American
flag must be nailed to the Philippines." So on, day
after day, and column after column, the Examiner
raved and roared for imperialism in the Philippines,
for government there irresponsible to the constitu
tion, and even published and indorsed General
Barnes' wild imperialist speech to the Republican
State Convention, saying that "he spoke for the
broadest and most progressive of the thinking men of
the country"; and now, that President Valentine ut
ters the opinion of "thoughtful men of affairs."
Surely politics never before put such folks in the
same bed as Valentine, Morgan and Hearst. The
public is interested enly in guessing which of the
strange bedfellows is laughing up the sleeve of his
night shirt.
In the same month in 1898 the Examiner called all
men who took the position that President Valentine
takes now, "little Americans, copperheads, Tories
and traitors," and accused President McKinley of
intending #0 let the Philippines go, abusing him there
for as roundly as President Valentine does now for
not letting them go.
President Valentine carries Wells-Fargo over to
the support of Bryan in company with Senator Mor
gan of Alabama, and quotes Scripture in transit, and is
indorsed by the Examiner. But that paper, indorsed
Morgan in 1898 in saying: "Brave Californians have
died in battle in Manila. Above the graves of those
heroes the American flag floats, and I believe the
American people will never consent to haul it down.
That flag will remain. The hand of God Almighty
planted it there."
This he prints in the Examiner with approval
of Mr. Hearst. Now, as we have shown by quota
tions from the Examiner, Mr. Hearst and that paper
were the first advocates of imperialism as now de
scribed by Mr. Bryan. The Examiner, as early as
June 27. 189S, was shouting in big type, "Nail the flag
to the Philippines."
It said in rejoinder to ex-President Cleveland, call
ing him a "pompous, stuffed prophet," "It is per
haps worth while to point out that 'the simple ma
chinery of our popular domestic Government,' of
which Mr. Cleveland speaks, will neither be changed
at home nor employed abroad, should it become nec
essary to administer outside dependencies. It is in
the power and right of Congress to devise any sort of
F\-stem that may apply to the conditions of such de
pendencies, and this power is in no wise limited by
the national constitution, nor does its application in
volve any modification of our domestic system. All
these things are familiar knowledge, but they do not
appear to make any part of the intellectual equipment
of the superior person who puts his faith in adjec
tives and expects the people to take him for granted."
With what tiie Examiner calis "clarity of reason
ing," the position of Wells-Fargo is summed
up by President Valentine in these words: "To
sum up my opinions from the beginning to the pres
ent of this whole miserable business, which I abhor;
I think the Philippine Islands belong to the Philip
pine people. I think that people have a right to
such government as they think good for themselves,
and we have no right to give them such government
as we think good for them."
The Examiner greets the support of Wells-Fargo
with glee, and is sumptuous in its ascriptions to
President Valentine. It introduces him as a
supporter of McKinley in 1896, now changed on the
Philippine issue to N be a supporter of Colonel Bryan.
We have reasons for doubting that President Valen
tine voted for McKinley four years ago, but, be that
as it may, his reasons for seeking the Examiner's
company and using its command of publicity for the
enlargement of those reasons, with which that de
lighted paper expresses the greatest sympathy, are
things that are justly subject to criticism. -
Colonel Bryan has published, in many counts, his
indictment of the Republican party, and one of the
strongest of these is the charge that the war taxes
were purposely arranged in the interest of ,the c,or
poraiions, so as to fall off them upon the people.
Now the Pullman Company stamps its taxable paper
without adding to the price of its service to the public
or abating the wages of its employes. The railroad
companies stamp their bills of lading without trying
to pa?s the tax to their customers. The only corpora
tion in the United States that" from the beginning
exacted the war stamp from the people was
Wells- Fargo. When it was exposed in this,
President. Valentine defended the shirking of its war
tax in the same able manner in which he announces
the support of Bryan by his shirking company.
Among the amazing things in the political maze of
the year, this is perhaps the most extraordinary! The
only great corporation that furnished the basis of
Colonel Bryan's charge against the Republican party
goes over to Mr. Bryan's support!
l "~T~^HE Examiner has solicited and secured a state-
I ment of the position taken by that great cor
'"Â¦*.'Â¦ poration, the YVells-Fargo Express Company,
in the current campaign. The information is fur
nished, as. is proper, by the corporation's president,
Mr. John J. Valentine, and lines the company up
with Bryan. We do not deal unkindly with Mr.
Valentine. He is the president of one of the great
est corporations of the country and controls its policy.
We do not deal with him at all in his individual
capacity, byt in his corporate relation.
WELLS-FflRGO FOR BRY0N:
Prosperity has come. It is measured in the stand
ard of gold and is founded upon the rock of protected
industry. All the prospects of the future are bright
and there is no menace except that *of Bryanism to
disturb the mind of even the most timid.
crusade for free silver to a new issue. With all his
crankiness on the mSney question he has sense
enough to perceive that to repeat his predictions of
1896 in the face of the facts of 1900 would make him
the laughing stock'of the people from one end of the
country to the other.

SUCCESSFUL TRIAL TRIP OF
NEW SUBMARINE WONDER
THE HORROR, THE I/ATEST SUBMARINE WAB VESSEL.
STAMFORD, Conn., Aug. 21.â Inventor J. C. Carter's mysterious sub
marine torpedo boat built on Ware Island, has made a successful trip
after scoring one failure, in which she capsized for lack of proper
ballast. The "Horror"â the nickname given to her by Connecticut peo
pleânow rides the waves as buoyantly as a cork.
Out of the water the "Horror" looks like a projectile of some sort. The
queer features about her are the lateral flns intended to raise or depress her
and the odd superstructure, which looks as if it does not belong there.
Every precaution has been taken by the inventor to prevent outsiders tak
ing a photograph of the mysterious submarine craft. He claims that the
vessel will revolutionize submarine torpedo work. Later he will tell how.'

"I am money proof. To show I speak

herself, the Infant Jesus, St. Elizabeth,

formal, pyramidal style which was a fa

The principal art galleries of Germany
are those of Berlin. Munich and Dresden.
The Berlin Museum is the. finest building
of its order in the German capital, oon
tains about 1200 pictures, and, although
possessing few masterpieces, affords one
of the best opportunities in Europe for
studying the history of art. It should be
visited first of the German galleries, for
after Dresden and Munich it might prove
disappointing. The Dresden Gallery con
tains approximately 23)0 paintings, and.
although less rich "in Gsrman. Flemish
and Dutch masters than Munich, and in
ferior to Berlin in works of the early
Italians, its collection of masterpieces of
the golden age of Italian painting is hard
ly equaled in Kurope. The galleries are
admirably arranged and well lighted, the
only drawback to study being the fact
that many of the best pictures are cov
ered with glassâ an arrangement necessi
tated, it Is said, by the smoky atmos
phere of Dresden. The Old Plnakothek
of Munich contains a collection of about
1400 paintings, which are excellently ar
ranged. The building, a rather plain
structure, in the renaissance style, some
what suggests the Vatican, and is situ
ated directly opposite the large parade
ground. It is a tine" place to study cer
tain masters, especially Rubens and the
early Germans. From the works of these
three great museums it will perhaps be
well to choose such specimens of the great
Fainters of old as best illustrate their in
dividual characteristics, and typify the
leading tendencies of the schools to which
they belonged. -, . '
Raphael Is strongly represented In the
German galleries. The most impressive
manifestation of his genius appears in
Rome, but as a painter of the Mrgln ne
Is seen to excellent advantage In Ger
many. The growth of his style is well
illustrated by four examples. The Ma
donna of Terranuova," In Berlin, shows
his early style, at the age of about -I.
It Is an extraordinary performance for a
painter of that age, although It has not
the distinctive style that marks his more
mature productions. The children s fig
ures suggest the style of Perugino. Ra
phael's master, and the Virgin's figure
suggests the style of Leonardo da vinci;
the originality of the artist was yet to be

The "Slstine Madonna" is the moat Im
portant of the paintings on canvas that
came wholly from Raphael's own hand;
for It Is to bo remembered that th.i
"Transfiguration." its or>ly rival, was un
finished at the time of his death and was
completed by his pupils. ThÂ» "Sistine
Madonna" is by no means beyond criti

September touched 72Â»i#72Vie and then dropped
on a very dull market to 71Tic. At this junct
ure the traders learned the foreigners wera
buying and from then to the end of the ses
sion this proved the governing factor.- Sep
tember advanced to ~i%c. but the announce

upon the dip as a good time to cover and Sep
tember recovered sharply to 73e, closing stroni

Corn was quiet, but strong, not weather:|n
Kansas, higher cables, small stocks and the
wheat strength kept shorts . uneasy. Septem

I NEW TORK. Aug. 21.â The stock market was
! narrow to-day, the only Incidents of note be
! ing the movements of certain industrials. The
I opening was easy on London's weakness.
j Sugar was depressed on the strength of a re
j ductlon in coffee prices, which was taken to
j indicate a pofslble resumption of the trade
j war in sugar, despite the recent maintenance
; of similar prices with consumers. The stock
; went off 1^, on the offerings of some large
; amounts. A continuance of the recent bear
; campaign against People's Gas accounted
; for its point fall. Small declines in railroad
I stocks were in sympathy with London and
1 reports of unfavorable conditions In crop dis
tricts. Business was only moderate during the
selling, and as liquidation was not forced the
shorts commenced to cover. Before the fore
noon expired prices were on the mend and
there were indications of confident buying In
spots. Rallies were most pronounced In the
stocks which had suffered earlier, and the gen
eral level was lifted above last night. Con
spicuous strength was shown by Brooklyn
Transit, Manhattan and Consolidated Gas, the
latter rising 2',Â» from the lowest. New Jer-"
eey Central then assumed a command
ing position In the market, rising 3>4 to
137**. which is a record price in Its recent
upward movement. An unfavorable statement
of earnings for July caused realizing and tnÂ»
stock sold off to 136 at the close. The general
list was largely neglected and showed no in
clination to rise above the level recorded about
noon. The market closed easy In tone, with
net changes generally a 6mall fraction either
way. -^ s
Business In bonds expanded to-day anl there
mas an active demand for St. Louis South
western second preferred which advanced th-im
l .t- The market was Irregular, but variations
slight. Total sales, par value. Jl. 115.000.

choice lots are growing harder to find. Prices
remain unchanged. But little is heard of Pears
as yet. Apples art rather quiet, but the crop
has been cut down all over the United States
by hot weather and a prolonged "drop."

ruled for a week or two. except paper-shell
Aimcnds, which are higher, the crop being
under expectations.
Thus far. this season 432 bbls of Royal Anne
Pickled Cherries have been shipped to Cincin
nati by the norther route alone. The value
foots up $12,960. The shipments will probably
continue for months to . come, unless a large
quantity is sent by. rail.
Watermelons are feeling the effects of the
warm weather, and are selling as fast as they
come in at slightly higher prices. Other Melons
are unchanged. Grapes are still in large supply
and cheap, with the exception of Wine Grape.*,
which are firm. Country Â¦ reports . are . to the
effect that buyers are bidding $20Â®22 per ton
for ZInfandels in the important districts. They
will probably sell high this year.
First class Peaches and Pears are firm, with
Indications of improved prices. Plums are
slow. Apples are steady, and the crop Is said
to be turning out light this year.
Limes have again declined.
Berries are steady and clean up well.

OAKLAND, Aug. 21.â Twenty-five years ago California Lodge No. 1, Ancient Order of United Workmen, was or
ganized at West Oakland. To-day the order celebrated Its silver anniversary by a picnic at Shell Mound Park
during tbe day and literary exorcises at the First Presbyterian Church In the evening. As the order was born
In Oakland a quarter of a century ago and as the present grand master of the State, Charles E. Snook, is a resi
dent of Oakland, it was fitting that the Alameda County lodges should have charge of the anniversary.
It was Attgust 21. 1S75, that the late Horace G. Platt. who was one of the original organizers of the Workmen,
called a meetltig in the hall on the corner of Seventh and Pine streets and formed California Lodge No. 1. A. O.'U. W.
There were fifteen members on the charter roll and the first officers were: Edward Surrhyne, master Workman; J. C.
Fields, past master workman; William II. Fiske, foreman; C. E. Henry, overseer. The other officers and members
were: J. A. Carlton. B. B. Allen. A. B. Hoag, J, A. Chase, E. Newottny, A. H. Anderson, W. H^Omey, John Woof,
J. W. Plummer, J. II. Tyler and A. Bear.
Since then the order has grown to be one of the most powerful in the State, but Oakland still continues to be
the home of the Workmen.
Grand Master Charles E. Snook was largely instrumental In arranging the celebration to-day, which waB success
ful in every way. . Â»
OAKLAND, Aug. -1.â Thousands .of
members of the Ancient Order of
United Workmen, their families and

of the order's birth. -From Oakland. Ala

ple while special trains brought as many
more from all the towns In Alamed'a
County. San Francisco sent a large quota
cf representatives to mingle in fraternal
r< There g waÂ« a big programme of enter
tainment. Games, dancinpand concerts
occupied old and young. The committees
snared nothing to make the celebration a
fiCcces? and to mark It as a red-letter day

crowds were handled S o well that not one
unpleasant incident, was recorded.

A meeting of the Thirty-seventh As
sembly District Republican Club was held
in Devisadero Hall, on Devlsadero street,
last. evening. Edgar Erlggs, the first vice
president of the club, presided, and T. L.
Henderson acted as secretary. Gustave
Gunzendorfer. the president, and Augus
tin Tildcn, the secretary of the club,
failed to appear. Their absence was ex
plained by General E. S. Salomon, who
addressed the meeting and said: "It is due
to the Republicans assembled here to be
informed of the necessity for this meet
ing. "We have patiently waited for a call
by the president of the Thirty-seventh
District Club for a meeting to select dele
gates to be voted for nrxt Friday. When
it became apparent that no meeting would
be called, a number of * Republicans as
sembled Monday night and. after lor.K
deliberation, appointed a committee to
wait upon the officers of the club and
ascertain why no meeting had been caucd
and also to take the necessary steps to
have a meeting this evening for the pur
pose of selecting delegates. The commit
tee called upon the president at 9 o'clock
this morning and he told them that he
had instructed the secretary to call a
meetlns for this evening, but that he did
not call it because he could not get the
hall. The committee ascertained that the
hall had been secured, but that the order
for It had been countermanded by
one F. Eggers. The committee tried 10
find the secretary and the president in
tljeir respective offices, but neither coui'l
be found. The committee then secure-!
the hall and sent men all over the district
to notify Republicans ot the meeting. The
Republicans of the district strongly object
to being deprived of their rights. It looks
very much like a trick and a bad one pi
to steal the delegates. The time has
arrived to demonstrate that we are free
and independent Republicans and no vot
ing cattle. If the Republicans of thÂ« dia
tribe desire to be run by and dominated
over by bosses, they will have an oppor
tunity to so declare at the polls next
Friday. If they desire independence they
ought to support ami fleet the delegates
that this club would jut in the field."

The amateur physician admitted tho cir
cumstances under which the morphine
was administered, telling the police that
Barry insisted upon taking the drug to
alleviate the Intense pain he was suffer
ing.
"It was a matter of precaution." ex
plained the Coroner, "that I reported the
case to tbe* police. Barry was unconscious
and had all the symptoms of morphine
poisoning when I was called to assist in
trying to save his life. Not bÂ»-ing accus
tomed to the drug, it had a very *pcciXy
effect upon him. I do not beli.-ve there la
anything of a criminal nature in the case.
Of course a positive decision as to the
cause of death will rest upon the result
of the autopsy."
Barry was 3ft years old. Oomrrford re
sides at 40U Telegraph avenue. His repu
tation Is good, and he has been steadily
employed an a watchman at Piedmont.
He Is greatly shocked at the outcome of
his effcrt to relieve his friend's trouble.
The police were notified by Coroner
Mehrmann of the circumstances of tho
case and Comerford was sent to the City
Prison.
"That will fix your pain for you," saiJ
Comerford, after he had injected a quan
tity of the diluted morphine into Barry's
arm. It did "fix" the sufferer with ;i
vengeance, for very quickly he went into ."i
stupor. Comerford became alarmed ant
had the saloon-keeper takrn to his room.
Dr. Mehrmann and ilt-lnle were hur
riedly summoned. For live hours. th.*y
worked over the drugged man, but Ihfl
dose had been sufficient to end his life,
and after all their labors he succumbt.il
at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon.
Knowing something about the soothing
effects of the drug and having a supply
on hand Comerford suggested that Barry
take a "shot." >
Comerford was a frequenter of Karry'3
saloon. This morning Comerford heard
Barry complaining of feeling ill. The
saloon man said he had very severe pair.s
in his stomach and believed he was suf
fering because of something he had eat :n
last night. As the day wore on Harry bt
came worse and renewed his eomciair.ts.
Comerford was arrested as soon as the
fatal result was known. He is held un
der detention pending the result of polico
inquiry and the Coroner's investigation.
There is nothing of criminal intent so
far as has been discovered in the affair,
Comerford telling a straight story of the
Henry A. Barry, a suloon-kcoper at
Thirty-ninth street and Telegraph ave
nue, was killed to-day by a hypodermic
injection of morphine administered by
Richard Comerford in an attempt to re
lieve Barry, who was suffering from se
vere abdomina^ cramps. The dose ot tho
drug was so great and the patient was
so quickly overcome that physicians' ut
most efforts failed to save his life.

Nusbaumer upon every opportunity, and
Judge Nusbaumer retaliates by trying to

Meanwhile the Interest in the approach-

The Congressional Convention of the
Third Congressional District will be held
to-morrow (Wednesday) morning in Ger
mania Hall in this city. In Itself the con
vention will not be very Â«:xciting, for
Victor H. Metcalf wiil be renomlnated
for Congress without opposition, but there
are some little matters connected with the
new Republican Central Committee that
is to be chosen that will make the session
of more than the prospective formal In
terest.
There will be the renominatlon of Victor
H. Mrlcalf by acclamation and a reaffir
mation of Republican doctrine by the con
vention. All of this wiil be a matter of
lorm. for every delegate is pledged to Mr.
Metcalf. Two years ago Mr. Hilborn
secured a split delegation in the Fiftieth
Assembly District, though the Hilborn
delegates all voted for Metcnlf. This year
there is not even a split delegation.
But after the Congressional Convention
is all over, and the nomination of Mr.
Metcalf has been mad?, there remains the
fight for the control of the Republican
County Central Committee. This com
mittee Ts to be cho?<>n. throe from eacli
Assembly district, and it iooVs v*>ry much
asf if each side would control nine mem
bers and that neither side would have an
absolute control.
Dr. Pardeo jind Guy C. Karl w!U con
trol the delegations from the Fiftieth and
Fifty-first Assemhlv districts, giving
them six men to br~in with. Judgp Nus
haumer will control thht from the Forty
ninth District, giving him threo m-n.
Thon will come the delegation from thÂ«.'
Forty-sixth District. That will be con
trolled by W. T. Harris of Pleasanton.
In the Forty-seventh District. Joseph R.
Knowland. State Senator Taylor and J. B.
Lanktrep will control, and while their
general sympathies ire with the Nus
baumer faction, they are somewhat Inde
pendent in their movements. Then corner
the Forty-eighth District. That Is con
trolled by Joseph Kelly, present Assem
blyman. Kelly has always affiliated with
the Nusbaumer element, but he was sup
ported by Fnrdee and Dalton and it is
presumed that he will throw his delega
tion with that of the Fiftieth and Fifty
first districts. That will make the align
ment exactly even; with nine men for
each side as a general proposition.
However, the present County Commit-
Must -Return Decoration Awarded

Three soldiers assaulted two women
whose names are still unknown to the
police at the corner oi "Taylor and Union
streets shortly before 11 o'clock Sunday
night. The cries of the women alarmed
the neighborhood a.nd caused much com
motion. After the uniformed brutes made
their escape from an angry mob of cit
izens who went to the scene to rescue
the women, they are supposed to have
continued their Journey out Union street,
where they attempted to break into a
house at 8 Olive court, but were fright
ened away by the report of a revolver.
j On Sunday night the two women, who
are sisters, were passing along Union
street. They had reached the corner of
Taylor when the three 'soldiers suddenly
sprang out from a vacant lot and seized
them. One of the women was successful
In making her escape. She dashed up the
hill between Taylor and Jones and rant
the door bells of the residences in thÂ»:
neighborhood, at the same time screa.m
ing for hejp. The first house the frantic
woman reached was that of Captain
James McDoru-id, at 912 Union street. His
family heard the woman's cries,, but be
fore they could reach the door she had
continued on -up the street. She pulieo.
the doorbells of several other residences
and brought the occupants to their win
dows. Most of the people who heard the
disturbance had disrobed for the night
and they were some time in reaching thÂ»
street.
In the meantime a Union-street' car
came In sight from the ferries. The
woman, seeing it, rushed to the middle
of the track, frantically waving her arms.
"When the car stopped she informed Con
ductor P. J. Foley that three soidiers
were beating her sister, and he started
back for the scene, armed with an iron
bar. Before he reached the snot several
citizens came along, and he, leaving the
woman in their charge, hastened back to
his car. Foley paid:
"The woman knelt down and with up
lifted hands bogged me to come to the
assistance of her sister. Her appeal was
so piteous that I could not resist. She
was greatly excited. She fairly ran back
to the spot, but as other people came to
her rescue I went back to my car. I saw
the three soldiers at the corner."
It appears that when the soldiers saw
the women returning with the citizens
WOMEN ATTACKED

STREET CORNER

SIEGE OF KIMBERLEY
they made their escape. .The woman who
had been held and beaten by them rushed
oft in another direction as soon as she
was free and her sister followed. No one
was able to learn the name of either. A
search of the premises afterward showed
that the woman held by the soldiers had
been dragged on the ground for several
feet.
In less than one hour afterward two
soldiers attempted to enter a house at S
Olive court, a small alley off Union
street, between Laguna and Buchanan.
The police believe that they are the same
parties that assaulted the women on Tay
lor street.

"I say that when the Paris Commission
met and the treaty of peace with Spain
was agreed upon and accepted by Con
gress the ending should have been
reached, and that ending was reached in
so far as our rights were concerned. But
those rights have been disregarded and
to-day we find ourselves In the midst of
an imperialistic contest, fighting for ter
ritory that our constitution forbids that
we should acquire.
"They tell us that California people are
for Imperialism because It is going to
open your ports and increase your com
merce. I insist that the love of this coun
try and its sacred traditions are dearer
to the Callfornian than the possible ac
quisition of an extra corner lot or a few
more ships of commerce.
Cannot Hold Philippines.
"The United States Government 13 a
government under a written constitution.
I'll go one step further. Under that con
stitution this nation has no power to hold
the Philippine Islands.'*
Mr. Taylor then took f up the trust ques
tion and said If Rockefeller, who Is giving
money to institutions and establishing new
hospitals, desired to pose as a philanthro
pist he could use the remainder of his
fortune In a manner a. thousand times
more acceptable by bringing about condi
tions where so many hospitals would not
be necessary. This love of money and
greed for wealth has cursed and destroyed
mankind since the beginning of the world.
The speaker then paid California a rosy
tribute and incidentally boomed the can
didacy of W. P. Lawlor to succeed him
self as Superior Judge of this city. Mr.
Taylor was on the point of retiring when
a voice from the audience wanted to know
how about the Boers, to which query the
orator replied:
"The heart of this nation Is in sympathy
with the man who fights for his country
and home. The progress of human civ
ilization is oftentimes unutterably cruel.
The Indian held this country, he roamed
it free, the graves of his fathers were
here, he treated the white man with kind
ness and welcome, but where is he to
day? And so it has been. As the sun
rises and sets, so it is the destiny of a
people to either sink or rise."
In regard to the Chinese struggle Mr.
Taylor said that the attempt to hold oÂ»Â»
to our Â¦ Eastern possessions lias opened
the door to the entanglement of politics
of Asia and all England. The present
policy of this administration, he said, is
injurious at home and absolutely destruc
tive of this nation abroad.
In reply to a question, "Would It be
right to give up what we have got in the
tast?" the speaker replied;
"We said at the beginning that this war
was not to be for acquisition. Who holds
title to this land In the Philippines? if
there be anything in the spirit that said
man was capable of self-government this
country ought to be ashamed to reverse
this doctrine anywhere on this earth I
am opposed to holding anybody in sub
jection, be he black or yellow."

UproariousConfusion
at Shiels Hall Pro
duced by a Gang
of Rounders.
THE proceedings of the gathering last
night at Shiels Hall resulting from a
circular issuc-d by twenty-eight
Kelly-Criminir.s members of the
Republican County Central Committee be
gan by a declaration by Chairman Alfred
Bouvitr of the meeting's- irregularity.
Bouvier addressed the audience from the
floor of the hall. He said:~
"Gentlemen, 1 would like to say to you
that I am in receipt of this circular pur
porting io be a call for a meeting of the
County Central Committee (reading the
circular). There is absolutely no machin
ery provided for calling a meeting of the
committee In this manner, it there were.
there la still no meeting to-night because
no punÂ»ose is stated in the circular sent
as notification to the members. Therefore
there is no meeting to-night. There can't
he a meeting and anything you do here
cannot boar ihe slightest semblance to
legality. I state this as a fact for your
information and not as a presiding officer
here. Gentlemen, 1 bid you good-even
ing." .
And Bouvier left the hall.
Augustus Tilden at" once called for the
first vice chairman, but there was no re-'
Fpcnse,. He called foxr the second vice
chairman and still there was no response.
The uproar bejran at or.ce, ar:d Tilden said
that as a member of the committee he
would take the chair till organization
could be effected. He called for Secre
tary Wilson, but that gentleman declined
to act. and Georere Sharp was ai>pointed
temporary secretary.
When ihe attempt was made to elect
Tilden anu Sharp chairman and secretary
for the evening, a stormy scene ensued, |
and the etortn lasted until an adjourn- !

Futile Efforts of Kelly
and Crimmins to
Defeat an Honest
DISGRACEFUL SCHEME OF BOSSES TO
THWART REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMITTEE
FUTILE AMD FARCICAL EFFORT OF THE BOSSES.
yj DISGRACEFUL but futile effort was made last night by twenty-five committeemen, wear-
ing the brand of Kelly, Crimmins and Herrin, to overthrow the plan regularly adopted by
the Republican County Committee for conducting the primary election on line's of decency
and honesty. proceedings from start to finish [were uproarious and farcical. Before the
tzveniy-fivc kickers started in to 'make a show of their weakness and . subserviency, Alfred Bou-,
zier. chairman of the County Committee, duly informed every one present that no meeting of the
County Committee had been called and that no meeting .would be held. The boss-branded commit
teemen, backed by a JwzMing mob of rounders and loafers, decided, however, to remain. After
many calls had been made for well-known members to preside, Augustus Tilden, who is supposed
to be seeking the favor of Kelly and Crimmins for nomination to the office of Justice of the
Peace, was elected to handle the gavel.
_.;. James A. Wilson, the regular secretary, refused to participate in the conference, hence
another man was chosen to act. The roll call was a holding farce. An old list of names was used.
As a name was called twenty rounders in the rear of the hall shouted, "Here." Several well
known and reputable members of the County Committee, who remained to see the circus, enlivened
the. proceedings by raising points of order. They made a monkey of the chairman to such a de
gree that he lost his temper and used profane and insulting language.
He was told that he zcas hanging his head with shame for the part that he was acting and
was asked to state frankly if he was not performing the service assigned to him in consideration
of a promise from Kelly and Crimmins that they would give him the nomination for Justice of the
Peace.
Practically nothing zvas done at the conference. A. resolution to appeal to the State Cen
tral Committee was declared adopted, but notice of reconsideration given by A. Ruef leaves the
subject pending. When the meeting adjourned the boss sympathisers admitted their defeat and
sci'cral of them applied for recognition.
It is doubtful if the protest from the kickers will be lodged with the State' Central Com
mittee, as the plan provided by the Republican County Committee gives- every honest citizen an op
portunity to vote once and to have his vote counted. The official call, signed by Alfred Bouvier,
chairman, and James A. Wilson, secretary, is published elsewhere in this paper.* Delegate tickets
to be voted for next Friday must be filed with the County Committee on or before noon to-day.
The tickets, uniform in size and color of the paper, must be obtained from the County Committee.
Credentials attesting the election of delegates must be signed by the chairman and secretary of the
Republican County Committee.
The bosses, Kelly, Crimmins and Herrin, have made a desperate effort to seize the Republican
local organization, but owing to the firmness and integrity of a majority of the County Committee,
plans to prevent as far as possible stuffing and repeating have been adopted. It remains nozu for
Republican citizens to go to the polls and vote the anti-boss ticket. '<
.."We can see that by your rulings," Ruef
retorted. "But as chairman of a special
meeting without a; purpose ;' I appeal to
you.; Can ! a resolution be ; changed and
emasculated in this manner?" â¢Â¦ Â¦-"
The point was ruled not well taken, and
amid sreat confusion a vote on Samuels'
Tilden ruled Ruef 's point of order not
well taken, and Leon Samuels urought
things to a crisis by offering a resolution
the passage of which waa the purpose of
the Kelly-Crimmins people in calling the
meeting. The resolution stated that cer
tain powers, which were named, were
conferred on the chairman and secretary
of the County Central Committee by the
resolution providing for the primary elec
tion, and that all others purporting to be
exercised under that resolution were in
! violation of it . and "are hereby declared
to be null and void and of no effect." The
powers named did not include that of ap
pointing a returning board. ;' -
I. J. Truman. Jr. reinforced the band of
obstructionists by declaring that the reso
lution went beyond the purpose stated in
the call for the meeting.. Ruef made the
point of order also that a resolution regu
larly adopted could not be changed sub
sequently by the adoption of another res
olution..; He appealed to Tilden "as an at
torney of standing and ability." -
Tilden ruled against him, and â¢ said he
was not acting in his;capacity of attor
ney. Â¦Â¦â¢;Â¦_.â¢ . . , - ' Â¦- -
The Bosses' Resolution.
"In the call for this meeting sent to
members," Ruef said, "the purpose is
omitted. There is nothing in it that gives
the slightest clew to the purpose of this
meetlnc"
George Sharp, from the Secretary's
desk, reported that all the members of
the committee were present. He moved
that three sergeants at arms be appointed
to preserve order. Adrian Smith offered
an amendment that ninety be appointed,
each a member of the County Central
Committee, since they were all there, but
Tilden tr!ed to put Sharp's motion, which
had no second.
"Whose motion Is that?" asked A. B.
Truman. "Have Kelly and Crlmmlns
promised you a nomination as Justice of
the Peace if you put a motion that has
not been made? If you get a nomination
through Kelly and Crimmins you will
never be elected. The Republican ticket
is a winner, but not a nomination from
those people."
Smith insisted on his amendment for
ninety sergeants at arms.
"It would take twice that many to sup
press you," Tilden responded.
"Your remark is unparliamentary and
ungentlemanly,". Smith shouted. "Any
man who will be on one side on Monday
night and on the other on Tuesday night
has no right to make such a remark. I
insist on an apology."
Tilden refused to make an apology and
t - i to drown Smith's voice by pound
ing with his gavel. Smith said Tilden
lacked the first item of self-respect. Til
den said something that was not heard
by many, but A. B. Truman said that the
chairman had called Smith a "d d
liar." More confusion followed, and the
body gave three cheers for Tilden.
Mr. Metzner insisted on a ruling on his
point of order that members had not been
notified forty-eight hours before the
meeting. J. P. Kelly came to the front
as a parliamentarian by moving that the
point of order be laid on the table, and
then moved that the privileges of the
floor be denied to Boyne, Smith and Tru
man. Boyne said he was there by invita
tion and they would have to put him out
if they wanted to get rid of him.
'.'Is this , a general or a special meet
ing?" asked Ruef.
"A special meeting," replied Tilden.
"Then what is its purpose?"
"I will say to you, and your abettorsâ"
began Tilden.
"You can't apply criminal terms to me,"
Ruef interrupted, and Tilden withdrew
the expression, but said that the meeting
was called in good faith to determine the
powers of the regular chairman in ap
pointing committees under the call for a
primary election. - . .

personal encounter. Sharp kept right on
calling the roll, the lobby doing the ans
wering and Boyne the objecting.
"Don't be a fool, Boyne,"* Tilden said
from the chair.
"I'm only trying to keep you from mak
ing a fool of yourself," Boyne retorted.
William Metzner made the point of or
der that the circular call for the meeting
had not reached many of the members of
the committee forty-eight hours prior to
the meeting, as provided in the by-laws.
The chair gave no ruling.
that the meeting was not a county com
mittee meeting, but simply a gathering of
members of the committee, and insisted
on a ruling, but Tilden refused to decide
the point.
"If this is a meeting of the committee,"
shouted J. G. Boyne, "I insist on a roll
call. But it is not a meeting. We are
only talking among ourselves."
George Snarp began a rollcall and Ruef
arose to a point of order. Sharp went
rifiht on with the rollcall, but the con
fusion was so great that no one could hear
the names called, and the lobby generous
ly shouted "Here!" in chorus each time.
Sharp's mouth framed the sounds that
were not heard.
"I insist on my point of order,'/ Ruef
shouted, "and no Mr. Shnrp can keep me
from making it. That is no official roll.
It is full of errors, omissions, mistakes
and dead men's names."
Tilden ruled that the roll was the regu
lar county committee roll. Adrian Smith
and A. B. Truman were both on their
feet with points of order and . Boyne's
voice topped all the confusion with de
mands that they be recognized.
Dr. R. C. Myer wanted a sergeant-at
arms appointed, and for a moment it
looked as if he and Boyne might have a

Bryan was eulogized, McKInley was

were condemned and the Republican party
and its principles generally were belittled
at a Bryan and Stevenson rally in Metro
politan Temple on Fifth street last even

of curious Republicans filled the big au
ditorium to Its seating capacity. The
speaker of the evening was the Hon. M.
F. Taylor, who stumped the principal
cities of the United States in 1SS6 for
Bryan and "Sixteen to one."
A couple of big bonflres on Fifth street
and the blare of a brass band attracted
a crowd and as early as 8 o'clock the
temple was pretty well filled. Red, white
and blue bunting was festooned around
the gallery railing and back of the stage
were American flags tastefully draped
around a silver shield, which was sur
mounted by the head of an eagle. Al
though 200 invitations were sent to promi

platform only about fifty responded, and
they marched in at 8:30 o'clock to the
strains of "There'll Be a Hot Time."

He paid Mr. Bryan a flattering tribute,
which elicited applause. Bryan, he said,
should be supported with enthusiasm, not
because of his stainless integrity and

because he is the standard bearer of those
principles calculated to perpetuate and
preserve the nation and Us great insti

Taylor's Speech.
Hon. AI. F. Taylor was then Introduced,
and he spoke for an hour and a half,
touching upon all the main Issues in the
campaign, besides giving his views on the
China situation and the Boer war, the
latter beine made at the request of an
uncertain individual in the audience.
"I shall never forget my first Introduc
tion to a California audience," he began.
