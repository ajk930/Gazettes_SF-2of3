In regard to the efforts of Archbishop
Ryan to bring about a settlement through
arbitration President Mitchell said:
Mine Workers at which men who had not
struck were urged to help in the fight
bore fruit. As a whole I feel more en
couraged to-night than I have at any time
since the strike began, and I am confident
that within the next few days the entire

COLUMBIA, Pa., Sept. 24. â According to the sentiment expressed to-night there -will be no break
in the ranks of the striking ironworkers at Columbia, who to-day quit work upon the attempted en
forcement of a reduction of 25 per cent. The strike affects about a thousand men and boys employed in
the four mills of the Susquehanna Iron & Steel Company here and six or seven hundred more employed at
the Aurora furnace at Wrlghtsville, the Vesta furnace at Watts Station and the York Rolling Mill at
York, all of which are controlled by the Susquehanna company. The $3 rate is in force at the mills in
the combine, but the strikers refuse to accept it because $4 , is paid at one of the Lebanon mills and
other independent works.

STRIKERS MAXE, SOME GAINS.
Presence of Troops Causes Consider
able Indignation.
HAZLETON. Pa., Sept. 24.â Contrary
to the expectations of both the operators
and striking coal miners there were no de
velopments in the strike situation in the
Lehigh region to-day. It was thought in
some quarters that owing to the presence
of. troops in thc^ anthracite coal fields a
break would occur in the ranks of the
strikers or that a large number of addi
tional men would refrain from going to
work. The operators, as a rule, predicted
a break In the strikers' ranks, and the
labor leaders were equally sure they
would tie up this region tighter than ever.
To-night both sides claim that they have
made good gains. It seems, however,
from the most reliable reports received
here to-day from the entire region that
the strikers made a net gain in point of
numbers. The M. S. Kemmerer colliery
at Sandy Run, on the north side, was tied
up to-day, but the operation is not a large
one. President Mitchell said of the whole
region to-night: -..- ;â¢:- i v ;

% J of the expected clash between the
P^^ troops and striking miners in the
,*Â¦ Schuylkill region to-day a pea.ee
ful calm pervaded the district and
there was not the slightest disorder -for
the soldiers to be called, upon to quell. In
fact. In all the districts of.' the anthracite
coal fields the day was extremely quiet,
there being no demonstration whatever on
the part of the strikers.
While the operators claim that a num
ber of their employes returned to work at
the mines in the Schuyklll region, it was
early In the day evident that operations
did not assume the activity which the
mine owners had yesterday anticipated,
and Indications to-night are that to-mor
row will find more idle collieries than at
any time since the strike began.
The soldiers moved over the roads lead-
Ing to the collieries in Schuylkill County
from early morning and . thus afforded
protection to those desirous of returning
to work. No opposition was encountered,
however, and not very many availed
themselves of the protection offered.
The strike leaders claim many additions
to their ranks, and President Mitchell
himself estimates that the striking force
was augmented to-day to the extent of
1800 to 2000.
No overtures to end the struggle have
been offered by either side. The strike
leaders are occupying themselves In In
ducing mine workers to quit, and the
operators are endeavoring to mine all the
coal they can with their reduced force.
Meantime coal shipments from the
mines are dally growing less, and reports
of advances in prices for the commodity
are received from all trading sections.
From out of the darkness a hostile squad
ron made up cf the battleships Kear
parge and Indiana ar.d the gunboat3
Eagle and Scorpion, together with the
fleet of six torpedo boats, attacked an op
posing squadron made up of the Massa
chusetts, the New York, the Vixen and
the Leydtrn. supported by th"e land batter
ies, and from what can be 6een at this
hour through the smcke that overhangs
the bay after the battle the defending
squadron was triumphant. Captain Fol
g-er of the Kearearge commanded the at
tacking craft and Admiral N. M. Farqu
har directed the defenders.
The maneuvers last night, which com
menced at 9:45 and lasted nearly three
hours, were in reality a night battle to j
test the effectiveness of an attacking
squadron, aided by torpedo boats, against j
a naval force aided by shore batteries, in j
which the searchlights for the time being
were used In place of shells, a well di
rected ray for a certain time putting the
craft out of action.
If a ton>edo boat could hold within
range of her searchlight one of the hostile
ships by firing a red rocket the craft on
the defensive was out of action, the fact
that the torpedo boat had the opportunity
to blow her up constituting victory. If,
on the other-hand, a .battleship got an op
posing- craft within range of her light and
was able to kefp that vtssel underwits
rays for the required time the battleship's
victory was shown by a blue rocket. The
preparations for. the mock\sea fight were
carried out in detail to the extreme, with
as much, attention almost as if a real fight
were impending. Every man was at his
post, the guns ashore and afloat were
manned and there was great anxiety on
the r>art of the defender* as th<> first
faint trace of the foe was discerned com
ing out of the darkness. It was SJM5 when
the roar cf an attacking gun awoke the
echoes which rolled back from the James
town shore, and In quick succession came
the heavy bark of a large caliber gun and
then the short, metallic ring of light ord
nance, the flashes and thunder telling the
hundreds of civilian spectators on shore
that the attack had begun and that the
port defenders were ready to repel the
enemy.
The Incoming squadron attempted to
pass Fort Adams and Fort Wetherell,
which defend the east channel, and Fort
Preble on the west. The torpedo boats
Gwynn and Rogers did succeed In passing
Fort Preble in safety under cover of
darkness. The Gwynn got her search
lights on the Massachusetts and had sig
naled that she was out of action, when
the Vicksburg in turn put out of action
the smaller craft. Then the Rogers fig
uratively blew the Vicksburg out of the
water. Thus for over two hours the bat
tle raged, and owing to the vigilance of
the defending force only the torpedo boat
remained in action.
The decision as to the victor will come
from a board of arbitration appointed to
judge the battle by points scored by each
individual ship. The defending squadron
is generally believed to be successful for
the reason that the shore batteries and
assisting squadron repelled the attack and
left only one of the hostile boats afloat.

MINNEAPOLIS. Minn.. Sept. 24.-A spe
cial to the Times from Faribault, Minn.,
says: The storm came without warning
upon the citizens of Mcrristown from a
><iuthw<iSteriy direction, pas.-ing over to
the northeast. The length of its path in
the village was less than half a mile, but
owing to its peculiar action the distress
and damage resulting are not as great
as they silgtit have been. The storm made
jumps of one block, but whenever it came
down everything was crumbled by the
r^wer c/ the wind.
A barn belonging to Dr. Dargabel, on
the outskirts of the village, was the first
structure destroyed. It was picked up and
carried a block, leaving the floor unln
iured, with two horses standing on it.
From here the storm jumped a block to
the saloon of Paul Gatzke. Before reach
ing the Gatzke saloon there is a two-story
building, which was left untouched.
All the people killed and Injured in Mor
ristown Â¦were in the saloon, having hur
riedly taken refuge there when the storm
was seen on the outskirts of the village.
There were sixteen people in the structure
at the time the stcrm struck. The building
was raised from its foundation and
crushed like an egg shell. Before the
bunding fell three people managed to es
cape, but the other thirteen are found in
the lists of dead and injured.
After leaving the saloon the storm
crossed the street and destroyed the barn
of J. G. Temple and took the roof from
the barn of W. M. Bigol. It then crossed
the Cannon River and destroyed the barn
of Adam Snyder, killing several hogs.
The storm iho-n passed off to the north
west and did no further damage.
Before reaching town the storm de
scended on the farm of John Olson and
killed a hired man named Peterson.
fifty French vessels from St. Pierre are
still missing, as the result of the recent

have been debating this afternoon was
the programme for Mr. Bryan after his
dates in New York from October 16 to
October 20 and again on October 26 We
have agreed upon the plan, but cannot
give it out now, as it may have to be
changed in some particulars.
"Ex-Governor Stone, who has been in
charge of the New York headquarters, Is
the man responsible for the determina

came here to-day with the statement that
while he could not promise that the elec

still the State was fighting ground, and
with Croker's help in New York City
there was a good chance of success. Tha*t
Croker would do all he could to help Bry

miners, besides the women, came out to
listen to the spfeech. When this place was
named. Mark Hanna was a director in the
Pacific Coal Company, whose mines are
here. Governor Roosevelt reminded his
hearers of the times four and six years
ago when It was difficult for miners to get
work, and asked them to compare tho3o
times with the present, when all were em
ployed, and all obtaining good wages, and
asked If they wanted to change back
again to the hard times from "which they
emerged with so much difficulty.
Laramie was reached at about half past
2 o'clock to-day, and here two speeches
were made to permit all who wished to

The day meeting aroused a good deal of
Interest here. Governor Roosevelt said
in part:
"I do not appeal to you primarily as Re
publicans. I appeal to you as Americans. 1
appeal to you as citizens with whom the

"Herein this Stateand in this city, whose

hardship, it surely Is unnecessary foPme
to call your attention to how this nation
first became the great nation that it now

we had had to deal with timid souls who
feared danger, and who feared to risk,
who feared to go forward when the na
tion went forward, you would not have

three years after the second Continental
Congress sat in Liberty Hall and declared
ourselves free and independent. In 1S03
occurred the greatest bit of expansion In

Thomas Jefferson we acquired what was
then called the 'Louisiana purchase,
which extended from the Gulf of Mexico

push to so ridiculous and fantastic a con

American people could take It. It was
right emphatically that we should deal

GALVESTON. Tex., Sept. 21.â The Gal

names. The indications are that not
more than 4000 people will be actually ac
counted for. The News has made a dili
gent effort to get as complete a list of the
dead as possible. It -s reasonable to as
sume that 800 to 1000 people were lost
whose names are not obtainable, which
would make the total death list on Gal
veston Island about 5000. The News is of
the opinion that the death list on the
island Is slightly below rather than above
5000. This statement Is made notwith

ASSEMBLING A BIG FLEET.
United States - to Have Thirty-Six
Vessels in Asiatic Waters.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 24.â The Navy
1 Department is doing everything In ltB
power to expedite the dispatch of ships
which the Government has decided to
send to the Asiatic station to reinforce
our fleet there. The Wilmington, attach
ed to the South Atlantic station, has sail
ed from Palmyra to Montevideo, where
she will coal and sail Immediately for
China via the Mediterranean. The cruiser
Albany now at the Piraeus, Greece, was
to-day ordered to proceed to Manila. The
other ships selected for service in Asiatic
waters, the battleship Kentucky, the gun
boats Annapolis and Vicksburg, and the
converted yacht Dorothea, are in Ameri
can waters and will go into drydock at
once, the Kentucky at New York, the
Vicksburg at Boston, the Dorothea at
L#ea#ue Island and the Annapolis at Nor
folk. The ships will not require much
time except in the case of the Annapolis,
which has been used as a training ship
and which must now be fitted out for
active service, but even in her case the
Navy Department estimates that not over
a month will be required. .It is expected
that all the vessels will have arrived at
their destinations by December 1. The
United States fleet in Asiatic waters will
then consist of thirty-six vessel*, by far
the largest American fleet ever employed
on strictly foreign service. Although many ;
of the ships are small, there will be a j
nucleus of heavy fighting ships that will
make a formidable showing in the event
that future complications should necessi
tate an American demonstration in Asi
atic waters. In case actual hostilities

MAY MAKE 2TEW PROPOSAX.
Germany to Suggest That Powers
Form an International Court.
LONDON. Sept. 2S. 3:30 a. m.âA semi
official statement has been Issued In St.
Petersburg that the European Cabinets
are engaged in an endeavor to induce
Germany to abandon her demand, for the
surrender of the Instigators of the antl
forcign outrages as a preliminary to peace
negotiations.
The Vienna correspondent of the Daily
Chronicle asserts that Russia's reply to
the German note is very friendly, but that
although it appears to consent to Ger
many's proposal it practically disapproves
by asking whether it would not be best to
open peace negotiations llrst and to make
the punishment of the instigators of the
outrages the first subject of discussion.
According to the Berlin correspondent
of the Daily Express. Germany will make
a new proposal, namely, that the great
powers form an international court to try
the Chinese officials accused of complicity
in the outrages. -
Tne Morning Post has the following
from its Shanghai correspondent, dated
yesterday:
"The Russians recently organized an ex
pedition toward Mukden, which has al
ready reached Lio Yang, about midway
between Niuchwang and Mukden. It will
probably encounter opposition.
"Prince Tuan's ascendancy created a
very israve danger. The only hope for for
eigners is that the pro-fortlgn Viceroy
of Xarkin has not been removed. Tuan's
emissaries are working hard to get him
out of the v/ay by murder or suicide."
AMERICA'S STAND CRITICIZED.
Chinese Situation.
h-n Inspired Berlin Telegram on the
COLOGNE. Sept. 24.â The Kolnische
Zeitung publishes an Inspired telegram
from Berlin in which the Washington
Government's reply to the German note
is characterized as a manifest effort to as
sist the Chinese Government to accept the
proposals Â¦with regard to the punishment
of the leaders in the Chinese trouble. The
telegram points out that though the
American reply shows an indulgent dispo
sition, it must not be deduced therefrom
that the Washington Government thinks
the United States' trade and missionary
Interests require less careful protection
than those of the other powers, but that
the United States Government i3 com
pelled to be Indulgent owing to the favor
able effect upon the situation in the Phil
ippines caused by the transfer of troops
from those islands to China. As a matter
cf fact, the telegram adds, the
vigorus and exemplary punishment
of the guilty counselors of the
Chinese court will be in accordance with
the interests of both American trade and
missionaries.
HUNTING OUT THE BOXERS.
For a settlement between the powers
and China it makes no difference, how
ever, asserts the telegram, whether Amer
ica co-operates any further or not. Forces
sufficient for all emergencies will remain
to secure the expiation demanded by the
civilized \7orld.
Chinese Troops Claim to Have Killed

SHANGHAI, Sept. 24.-LI Hung Chang

Â§ BRANCH p|g{^^g^j^o| IBOSS McNAB In his selection of
delegates to the Democratic Mu
nicipal Convention paid great at
tention to quality. Last night
representatives of the exclusive
Democracy assembled at Odd Fellows*
Hall to nominate Judicial officers and
transact other business. Jasper McDon
ald, chairman of the County Committee,
viewed the excluslves with pleasure. He
was proud to observe that there were no
political bummers or camp followers In
the convention. The chairman, Louis de
F. Bartlett, matched the convention In
point of style and aristocratic dignity.
He presided in a gentlemanly and decor
ous manner. Delegates rising to addres3
the. -chair were not Ignored or insulted.
The programme carefully arranged by
Boss McNab was executed to the letter.
The nominations foreshadowed in The
Call were made without opposition. The
Call announced that Lawlor, DalngerCeld,
Coffey and Costello would be nominated
for Judges of the Superior Court. Fifteen
legislative nominations as foreshadowed
In this Journal were duly recorded by the
convention last night.
Wild Enthusiasm Over the Name of Dainger
fleld â Convention of Excellent Person
nel" and Capacity for Business.
Boss McNab's Programme Carried Out to the
Letter by the Exclusive Democratic
Organization-Hearst's Tarn Down.
REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR SUPERIOR JUDGE.
Continued on Fifth Page.
The session of the convention would
have been devoid of enthusiasm and spirit
if W. R. Hearst had not in advance de
manded the exclusion of Judge Dainger
fleld from the ticket. It transpires that
such demand was directly made and
promptly denied. News of the incident
quickly spread yesterday a Al Democrats
from every section of the jClty began to
rally to Dalngerneld's support. Groups of
men on the sidewalk near the hall dis
cussed the Examiner outbreak and pre
dicted that Hearst's opposition would give
DalngerfieM an immense majority.
In the early proceedings of the conven
tion reference was made to the quallta^if
fearlessness In a Judge. The audience
caught the significance of the allusion and
responded with earnest and prolonged ap
plause. Later on. when candidates were
announced, there was a scene of great en
thusiasm following the mention of Daln
gerfleld's name. The delegates, deeming
an ordinary demonstration inadequate,
arose and cheered. The ovation accorded
to Dalngerfleld was the only event of the
meeting that was not on the programme.
A rope was stretched across the hall to
mark the boundary line between delegates
and outsiders. Seven police officers were
on duty at the rope, tut their services
were not needed to nut any one in or
bounce anybody out. The applause of
Thomas O'Brien was arrested by the po
lice, but O'Brien himself, divested of his
enthusiasm, was allowed to go free.
It may be said to Boss McNab's credit
that a finer looking political convention
never assembled in San Francisco. The
deportment of the delegates was beyond
reproach. There were no knock-downs
and drac-outs. In the Indorsement of
The Democratic party of the city and
county of Son Francisco, In convention
assembled, hereby reaffirms its alls
glance to the principles contained In tho
National Democratic platform adopted
at Kansas City and our unfaltering
loyalty to our matchless standard-bear
ers. William Jennings Bryan and Adlal
E. Stevenson.
We pledge our candidates for the Leg
islature to a faithful adherence to thÂ»
State platform adopted at Ban Jose.
We call the attention of voters to the
nececslty of adopting the constitutional
amendment enabling the' Legislature to
enact a primary law.
An honest and fearlees Judiciary li
necessary to protect public and private
rights, and the well-known methods of
corrupt political bossism now In control
of the Republican municipal party will
cause voters to carefully scrutinize the
names submitted, and on behalf of our
candidates we appeal to the Independent
voters of San Francisco to vote for such
men as will, in case of their election,
be uncontrolled and unpledged.
We commend the administration of the
city government for Its Intelligent and
aggressive policy In inaugurating tho
new cfcarter, for the reduction of (u
rates, water rates and for the assess
ment of valuable franchises and other
property which by escaping taxation In
the past has thrown an unjust burden
upon all classes of our citizens. Natural
monopolies In the control of private
corporations breed municipal corruption,
and we approve the efforts that are being
made to bring the question of the owner
ship of a municipal water supply before
the voters of this city. By this means
corruption will be eliminated, the water
supply Improved and the future of San
Francisco and its population shall be
greatly benefited In this Important
branch of our municipal service.
The city of San Francisco |s congrat
ulated by the Democratic Municipal Con
vention on having a clean, honest and
Incorruptible administration In public
affairs â something rare In the history
of other American cities â and for the
part that the reorganized Democracy
has taken in bringing: about these condi
tions we ask a respectful consideration
of our candidates and a continuation of
public confidence.

Samuels of the Twenty-ninth named
Thomas F. Graham, whose name produced
fully as much noise as did that of Ker

brought Director General Kelly's cane into
action.
R. W. Roberts, new-fledged Assembly
nominee from the Thirty-eighth, sprung
an extremely mild surprise in the nomina

the cheers of all factions Abe Ruef took
the stand to second eloquently, the nom

The nominations were closed by Case of
the Forty-second, who claimed the stand
to place before the convention the name
of ex-Judge George W. Schell.

and George R. Wells of the Thirty-sixth
said he felt proud to name Daniel J. Mur

Thomas P. Woodward of the Fortieth
named Max C. Sloss, and in doing so paid
that aspirant high tribute. He referred to
his powerful family connections and his
powerful personality, and went surety for
the honesty and brilliancy of his term If
election should come to him. Chairman
Bergerot himself did the seconding and
was not less strong in his expression than
T. D. Dinkelspiel next claimed the stand
to name Judge George H. Bahrs for re
nomination. He thought it not advisable
to swap horses in the middle of the

stamp approval and the gang did not en
thuse.

It has been said that he has worked in a

of Martin Kelly, rose and in a hesitating
voice said he "didn't like Wilson's re

address that reflects on the convention"
said Chairman Bergerot.
Then Riordan moved that the nomina

he got unanimous consent. A subsequent
motion by George R. Fletcher, Czar of
Richmond, to make Kerrigan's nomina
tion unanimous and direct the secretary
to cast the vote, found no dissenting voice.

as the nominees of the convention for
the four "long terms": Max Schloss,
Thomas F. Graham, Daniel J. Murphy
and Davis Louderback. The result was
as follows:
MARTTK KELLY. Bergerot, his
chairman, and his majority of
the Republican County Conven
tion last night put through the
Kelly slate with but one eras
ure and with no trouble. The
opposition was there, and it was there in
force, but before last night it had been
demonstrated to the decent element In
the convention that to fight were less than
useless, and no fight was put up.
The two hours prior to the convention
were characterized by some of the quick
est and rawest "double-cross" work to
which Martin Kelly ever pleaded guilty.
Superior Judges George H. Bahrs and E.
A. Belcher, to whom the rotund boss of
Fifth street had promised renominatlon.
were turned down without warning, and
without any reason save Kelly's own and
"Tom" Graham and ex-Judge and District
Attorney Daniel J. Murphy were slipped
In their places. Kelly tried to hand the
same cold-blooded turn to Percy V. Long,
to whoso nomination as Justice of the
Peace he had consented, but Long was
made aware of his intentions, made his
fight on the floor of the convention and
beat the newly chosen "slate man" out
by a handsome figure.
CONTROL OF COMMITTEE.
In face of the expose made in the Call
yesterday morning, Kelly and his gang
did not dare put through the blanket
County Committee they had programmed.
Instead, they modified their plan so that
it would appear that the opposition would
have as much to do with the naming of
the committee as Kelly himself. The
proposition which they offered, and which,
perforce, was accepted, was that each of
the Assembly districts should name four
members and the chairman name eighteen
at large. The joker lay In the eighteen at
large. Chairman Bergerot, Kelly's man
Friday, will have the making of the list,
and since he has already announced bla
tantly that he is ready to take his mas
ter's bidding it Is evident that the balance
of power will be placed just where Kelly
wants it. Although every Assembly dis
trict named its committeemen last night,
Kfclly has decided that the eighteen at
large shall not be named until after the
election has occurred and he has had op
portunity to select those that prove faith
ful to him throughout the fight.
It to Bosses.
Barnes Introduces Resolution Giving
Chairman Bergerot opened the session
with a reiteration of his previous wexn
ing to "get out and register." And then
he broke another rule. Despite the fact
that the order of business demanded the
Immediate nomination of Superior Judges,
Bergerot permitted Â¦William S. Barnes to
leave for a time the protecting arm of
Martin Kelly and sprinp. out of order,
the resolution which was calculated to
throw to Kelly and his cansr the control
of the County Central Committee, which
is to rule for the two years to come. The
Keily programme was nicely wrapped up
in the following package:
Resolved, That there shall be a governing
committee of the Republican party from all
of the Assembly districts contained within the
city nad county of San Francisco, consisting of
ninety members, whose term of office shall be

speech of the evening. Chairman Ber
gerot, after the preliminaries were ' over,
announced as the first order of business
the selection of a nominee for the unex
plred term on the Superior bench, and
XUordan came forward to name the popu
lar nominee of the evening, Frank H. Ker
rigan.
In offering Kerrigan's name Mr. Rior
dan spoke as follows:
"It Is a source of great pleasure to me
to seize this opportunity of placing in
nomination a gentleman whom I have
known both professlonaly and socially
more than ten years. He Is not young;
not old, though comparatively old in ex
perience. I have often listened to that
stereotyped eulogy of men, wherein they
have been referred to as self made men.
Still in this case I feel Justified in so re
ferring to him whom I am about to place
in nomination, the Honorable Frank H.
Kerrigan.
"In the truest sense of the word. Judge
Kerrigan is a self made man. Through
the fields and the factories he has labored
to the honorable position he now occu
pies. During his six years on the bench
of the Justice's Court he has honored the
Republican party and will bring greater
honor to it as Judge of the Superior
Court."

HARTFORD, Conn., Sept. 24.â Joe Wal
cott and Mysterious Billy Smith fought at
the Coliseum to-night, the fight being
scheduled for twenty .rounds.' At every
stage of the fight Walcott proved him
self to be Smith's superior. ? He fought
him all over the ring, landed at will, and
at the- end of the ninth round Smith had
received so much severe punishment that
he complained of his left hand, being- bad
and wanted to quit. â¢â¢â¢Â¦â¢Â¦.
The referee refused to allow him. to do
so and In the tenth round Walcott went at
Smith 1 " hammer and tongs, administering
terrific right and left swings to .the
stomach and head. SmlthT who had
fought foul in some of the earlier rounds
realized that he was no match for Wal
cott. deliberately fouled him by holding,
whereupon he wan disqualified and sent to
his corner by the referee and Walcott was
declared the winner.

"Lanky Bob's" Trainer Follows Beeh Olsen to Copen
hagen and Conquers Him in One Fieree Bout.
WRESTLER ERNEST
ROEBER, the famous
trainer of Fitzsimmons,
has regained the laurels he lost
when he went to defeat last
spring in- Madison-square Gar
den, New York, under the Dan*
ish champion, Bech Olsen. In
the-' 'following recent cablegram
from Copenhagen to his brother
AVilliam he announces that he
vanquished Olsen at that place
for the world's . championship :
"William, Roeber, 327 Eighth
avenue, New York: Desperate
wrestle.; . Victorious. Olsen
would not continue.
"ERNEST."
Roeber, sore at his defeat at
the hands of the husky Dane,
camped on his trail for months to
get a return match. When Olsen
went to Europe Roeber followed,
but for a time could not get his
man to comedo term$. Finally
the big, German wrote friends in
New York that he had succeeded
in getting the Copenhagener*s
consent to a match, one condi
tion, however, being- that Roeber
should throw his opponent inside
thirty minutes' or lose the deci
sion.
This is the match, evidently, in
which Fitz's trainer proved the
victor. The cablegram would in
dicate that Olsen could not stand
the pace and gave up.
There was another very liberal attend
ance of racing- enthusiasts at Oakland
track yesterday, it being the second offer
ing of the Golden Gate Fair Association
to turf followers.., Trevathan. Casdale and
El Midoâ warm choices'â failed to come
'through," and honors rested with the:
books.
I The 2:17 trot which opened proceedings
was taken in straight heats by Twilight,
driven by Dennis Gannon. Many thought
General Smith might- have been handled
to better advantage. It Is just possible a
race last week took the edge off the horse.
Potomac and Julia S were distanced in
the first heat.
For some reason, the public Insisted on
malting Trevathan. favorite. The Alameda
Stable entry closed a 6 to 5 choice for the
first five furlong sprint, and was beaten
hands down by Fortunatus, ridden by
Tullett. Urchinl Â¦ a, well backed obe. lbst
the show to Hiram Johnson.;
Closing a 2 to 3 chance, Midlove, run
ning In the color3 of "Billy" Randall,
made short work of her company. She
passed Lady Helolse at the paddock,
winning without being; extended. Ping.
Â¦wl # th a legion of followers, never showed
an ounce of speed.
Mounce gave .his nrst splendid exhibition
of how not to ride a horse on Grady in the
mile and a sixteenth run, taken by Sunel
lo, the favorite. The latter waded to the
front when asked by J. Walsh, beating
Meadow Lark with a good punch left.
Grady carried almost as much support as
the winner, but the weak efforts of
Mounce precluded â¢ all chance of the
horse's backers gathering anything. Spike.
a backed long shot, led. to the stretch,
when he answered the dinner bell call.
After betting had progressed for some
time on the seven-furlong selling affair
Brown Prince could not be found, and all
bets were declared-off. Casdale ruled fa
vorite and again went down. Pilot, car
rying the smart money, led from start to
finish. Later It was discovered that Prince
got away from the boy who was leading
him.
Johnny Campbell, so It was said, was
very wrathy over the efforts of Mounce
on El Mido in the last number, at one
mile and a sixteenth, and why not? The
Sir Modred horse closed an 11 to 10 choice,
and after striking the stretch 'under four
teen wraps Mounce allowed Ames on Lena
to slip up on the inside and win by a
head In 1:49*4. In endeavoring to rate
Snips. J. "Walsh made a bungling job of
it, falling to get Inside the money.

In all cases the land authorized to be se
lected in lieu of that relinquished is required
to be vacant and or>en to settlement. Vacant
public land Is or-en to settlement only when It
contains no known salines or mines, whether
of gold, silver, petroleum or any other mineral.
The statute under which the scrlrrers filed
is a dain standing offer on the part of the
Government to exchange any of Its lands that
are vacant and open to settlement for a like
quantity of similar land within a forest reser
vation, for which It had previously Issued a
patent or to which an unperfected bona-flde
claim had been acquired.
Complainants allege the non-mineral af
fidavits were not reauired by law, but
Judge Ross declares the fact remains
that such affidavits were made and con
stituted a representation and one of the
means by which the selectors sought to
secure the lands; and, having been made
for the purpose of evading and defeating
the law, no court of equity should lend
its aid toward securing the fruits of the
fraud. The court continues:
LOS ANGELES. SÂ«pt. 24.-In the United
States Circuit Court to-day, In the suit of
the Cosmoa Exploration Company vs. the
Gr.ay Eagle Oil Company and the Pacific
Land and Improvement Company vs. the
Elwood Oil Company, known as the
"scrippers" case and involving the right
of scrippers to file upon oil land as agri
cultural. prior to the actual discovery of
oil thereon. Judge Ross handed down a
decision denying the application for a re
ceiver and for an Injunction, sustaining
the demurrer of the defendants and dis
missing the bill at complainants' cost.
Judge Ross reviews the affidavits made
by the scrlppera, to the effect that the
lands filed upon by them were not min
eral or claimed for mining purposes, and
that the application therefor by the scrip
pers was not made for the purpose of
fraudulently obtaining title to mineral
land, but with the object of obtaining the
same for agricultural purposes.
He declares these affidavits to be palpa
bly false, and says that had the appli
cants stated that they at least believed
the lands sought contained oil and that
they wanted them for that purpose and
desired to select them under the law au
thorizing agricultural lands to be taken
in exchange for lands situated within a
forest reservation surrendered to the Gov

are authorized to select lands In the actual
bona-flde occupancy of others under the set
tlement laws or under a mining location, even
though the location be Invalid by the absence
of a valid discovery of mineral.
Whether the lands In controversy should be
classed as mineral or agricultural Is a ques
tion for the determination of the Government.
The lands in controversy were surveyed by
the Government In 1S54 and returned as agri
cultural, but Secretary of the Interior Teller,
In a communication to the General Land Office,
speaks at large of the notations of surveyors,
saying they are prima-facie evidence only of
the character of lands and subject to rebuttal
by satisfactory proof of the real character of
the land; and the determination of the char
acter of land Is subject to revision by the
Commissioner of the General Land Office, and
on appeal from him by the Secretary of the In
terior. And the rule to be adopted Is that
they will be considered agricultural cr mineral
according as they are more valuable In the one
class or the other.

What are the issues, in this campaign? The
first- is to urÂ»Jiold the honor and dig-nlty and
preetlffe of this nation. Our first duty aa men
and citizens Is to uphold the constitution, to
uphold the flag, to the end that this republic
may stand among- the first â¢Governments of tho
earth. And does it not stand there to-night
under McKlnley and under the Republican ad
ministration ?
The Democracy at present stands â¢where It
has always stood, in favor of a so-called free
trade policy, which would mean the destruc
tion of nearly every Industry In the State of
California. Remember this, men of this coun
try; remember that four years ago, under the
Democratic "tt'llaon tariff bill, in a time of
profound pfcace throughout this country, the
revenues derived under that law . were insuf
ficient to pay the ordinary running expenses of
the government^ so that it became necessary
for this country to borrow $260,000,000 in a
time of profound peace. This Government In
time of peace or In time of war must sustain
Itself and pay Its way.
Hear the San" Franciscan.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 24.â Two
thousand people assembled to-night to
listen to Samuel M. Shortridge's address
upon campaign Issues as viewed from a
Republican standpoint. Considering the
fact that rain fell during the evening the
reception to the San Franciscan was grat
ifying. In the course of his speech Mr.
Shortridge said : :. Â¦
Two Thousand San Bernardinans
ADDRESSED BY SHORT RIDGE.
"I present to you," said Young, "the
name of a man just and fair and one who
treats all people alike, be they . rich or
poor, high or low, with or without power.
I present the name of a man who is an ln
cumbent of the benchâ the name of Wil
liam R. Dalngerfield."
At the mention of the name the dele
gates rose to their feet and .cheered and
ehouted until they were hoarse. Then
Young continued.
"His nomination will mean his election.
"This Is a time when we Democrats are
wont to glorify two men and two men
alone, and we are fighting shoulder to
shoulder to preserve the happiness
Democracy assures us; but we can only
secure that happiness through an honest,
fair and learned Judiciary, and we should
have for our Judges only men who will
follow the dictates of justice and of solid
learning. San Francisco through the judg
ment of a Democratic executive has on Its
bench a man who has fully borne out the
wisdom of that judgment. He is not a
politician arid sought no office. I refer to
the Hon. William P. Lawlor. Judge Law
lor is incorruptible, he is intelligent, he is
patient and he is Just, and It is our duty
to name a man such as he, who is not
only fit but is strong before the people.
His qualities will insure his success at the
polls.- He has been a life-long Democrat,
and it Is but Just that the Democracy
should be the means of bringing his name
before the people."
There was great applause for Lawlor,
and then E. B. Young came forward. It
was known that Young was going to nom
inate Daingerfield. and the delegates could
not control their desire to cheer before
the name was uttered.
Hull McClaughry was thÂ© first to re-
Bpond to the call for nominations for Su
perior Judges. He said:
The platform reported by Chairman M.
H. Herman of the platform committee
was adopted with considerable show of
enthusiasm and then the announcement
was made by the chair that the privileges
of election committee from each district
would meet in room 10, Academy of Sci
ences building, this afternoon between 2
and 6 o'clock for the purpose of indorsing
the certificates of the nominees. Tho
nominations for the Senate and Assembly
were then announced. The reports from
the Thirty-fourth and Forly-third As
sembly districts and the Twenty-third
Senatorial District were passed until later
In the evening.

The Committee on Order of Business

of the said city and county, be- and is hereby

A resolution exacting a fee of $10 from
each nominee and one limiting nominat

wre also Included In the report.
The report of the committee on order of
business and organization was adopted.
Maxwell reported for the committee on
credentials that the roll call was its re
port. The report was adopted. There was
some talk of the throwing out of proxies,
but the chairman ruled that they were
allowable. - ;-v>>->-j.>
GETTING DOWN TO WORK.
Order of Business and Resolution
secretary. A motion to adjourn was
made and the vote on it was 14 to 14. The
deadlock did not change during the ses
sion.
Delegates from the Thirty-first District
argued that as that was the banner Demo
critic district of the city the nomination
should not be taken out of It into a Re
publican district. Joseph Slye of the Thir
ty-ninth asserted that his district had be
come Democratic and for that reason had
fourteen delegates under the apportion
ment. He said that for eighteen years
they had supported the candidate put up
by the Thirty-first District, and they
thought It was time for the nomination to
come to them.
The deadlock could not be broken and
numerous motions to adjourn were lost by
a tie vote, until the chairman finally de
clared the meeting adjourned and led the
way back to the convention hall to report.
The row in the Thirty-fourth, which
caused it to be passed early in the even
ing, was raised hy J. E. O'Brien, who was
not present when P. F. Higgins was elect
ed chalman. He declared there was no
chairman. During the recess, however,
the delegation got together and agreed on
Higgins. Then William D. HInes was
nominated for the Assembly.
The delegation from the Forty-third also
got together and agreed on J. J. McGuire
for the Assembly.
When the convention reassembled these
nominations were reported and ratified.
The failure of the Joint delegation from
the Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth to agree
on any one for Senator for the Twenty
third Senatorial District was also report
ed, and the delegation was given until this
evening to come to an agreement.
Denman then reminded the convention
that there was still a nomination for a
member of the Board of Equalization from
this district unmade, and he moved that
the convention adjourn to meet at Odd
Fellows' Hall this evening at 8 o'clock to
wind up its business, and then, after ad
journing sine die, to reconvene as a con
vention to nominate a member of the
Board of Equalization from this district.
This motion was carried and then the 4 el *
egates left the hall.
It was then moved that the convention
adjourn to this evening at 8 to settle the
district troubles, but this motion was
amended to "that the convention take a
recess of fifteen minutes to allow the
Twenty-third Senatorial District to nom
inate a Senator." A vote was taken, but
It was too even for the chairman and he
acceded to the demand for a roll call.
There were offers of all kinds of motions
but none were entertained by the chair.
The Thirty-first gave 14 noes; the Thirty
ninth gave 14 ayes. The result of the roll
call was an overwhelming majority for
the recess, and the convention took its
third recess. , ,
The Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth dis
trict delegates convened at once In the'tla
dles' parlor. J. F. Renault was made
chairman and John C. jQuialan was chosen
Senatorial District Disagree.
TAKES THE THIRD RECESS.
Delegates From the Twenty-Third
On motion the secretary cast the ballot
of the convention for the five nominees
for Justices of the Peace.
"I nominate," he said, "a man
who was educated here and has practiced
law here: a man who springs from the
people; whose armor is fidelity, his sword
ability and his name Is James E. Mur
phy."
W. B. Cope made the last nominating
speech. He said:
"I desire to place before you the name
of a young Democrat who has done ser
vice for the Democratic party, who has
been elected to the Assembly and has
made there a clean, honest record. I
place before you for your consideration
the name of D. S. O'Brien."
"The candidate whom I shall name Is
known to you all, to the bench and bar
and to the rank and file of the party. I
have the honor to nominate Joseph B.
O'Connor."
Thomas M. O'Connor then came for
ward.
"I will name a man," he said, "who. If
elected, will redeem the Justices' Bench
of this city from the scandal and slime
that nas been cast upon It by the charge
that it has been operated for the benefit
of certain collection agencies In this city.
I name honest John Prosek."
Curtis Hillyer mounted the platform for
the next speech:
"Gentlemen: I do not have to be a good
guesser to know that if the candidate I
name shall be your nominee he will break
Into the ranks of the enemy for votes.
He Is known In San Fra/iclsco wherever
the Democratic language Is spoken. I
nominate T. I. Fltzpatrick."
Edward I. Coffey took the platform to
nominate "a man from the largest district
In the city."
'I will nominate a man who Is a great
lawyer himself and the son of a great
lawyer. He is a man who will fulfill the
demands of this platform, a man fearless
and unpledged. I name Gaillard Stoney."
On motion the secretary cast the ballot
of the convention for Stoney.
"When nominations for Justices of the
Peace were called for, Charles A. Swelgert
came forward and said:
Nominations for the Judge for thÂ© short
term brought up Charles S. Peery. He
said:
A storm of applause followed the nam
ing of Judge Coffey. It was moved and
seconded that the nominations for Supe
rior Judges for the long term be closed
and the secretary be instructed to cast
the ballot for the four candidates named.
The motion was carried without a dissent
ing voice.
"When you hear the name of the candi
date I shall name you will know that no
eloquence Is required on my part. He
has served on the bench here for six
years. I met him socially ten years ago,
and in all of these ten years I have never
changed the good opinion I then formed
of his mild, pure mind. No one can point
to an Instance where he has left the path
of duty. I desire to nominate James V.
Coffey."
His life Is an open book and his record Is
without blemish. I present the name of
Judge Dalngerfield to you." Then there
was more cheering and shouts of "He's
elected already!" and more cheers, until
the chairman rapped for order.
O. M. Goldaracena then came forward
and said:
"I desire to place before you for your
consideration the name of a man who Is
well equipped with profound learning in
the law. He was reared in San Francisco,
where he has practiced law for twelve
years. He has thus gathered experience
which Is one of the essential attributes of
a good Judge. You can make no mistake
In giving the nomination to a clean-hand
ed, honest gentleman, and I refer to Ste
phen V. Co3telio."
J. D. Maxwell then mounted the plat
form and said:
That the order of business be: Report of
committee oa credential*, report of committee
en platform, report of Legislative nominations
ty district corrventlons, nomination of four Su
perior Judges for the full term, nomination of
a Superior Judge for the ihort term, nomina
tion of five Justices of the Peace.
On motion of McDonald a recess of
twenty minutes was then taken to allow
the committees to prepare reports.
After the recess the committee on order
of business and organization recommend
ed as follows:
That the temporary officers be made perma
nent.
Jasper McDonald Quelled a gathering
sttjrm by remarking that those matters
could come up later. â¢
The delegiftions from the Thirty-first
the Thirty-ninth districts each consists of
fourteen. Thomas W. Hickey had with
drawn from the contest for the nomina
tion and the Thirty-first District dele
gates claimed the nomination and reused
to gro into a caucus pending their wtorts
to induce J. F. Renault, chairman of
their delegation, to accept the honor in
place of Hickey. On the other hand, the
delegates from the Thirty-ninth District
were clamoring for a caucus and were
said to hxÂ» ready to cast 14 votes for Louis
Ward. They pointed to the fact that for
eighteen consecutive years the Thirty
first District had had the Senator, and as
serted that it was time for the Thirty
ninth to be given the honor. In this state
the fight was left for a while.
C. J. Gallagher of the Thirty-first said
his delegation was not ready to agree
upon a Senator from the Twenty-third
Senatorial District, and In view of the
fact that the delegation was not ready he
did not see how It could be forced to meet
and nominate.
After the naxntnjrof the committee, Jo
seph Slye of the Thirty-ninth wanted to
know If Senators had to be nominated
last night. He said the Thirty-first had
refused to meet with them, and he want
ed the chairman of the convention to set
a time and place for the Joint meeting
some time In the evening.

are many. Oa every side they cry
out for relief. Hundreds have
come to believe that there is no
cure for the distressing ailments
tlxat sap beauty and life.
This is an error. There is a
cure for everything. If one medi-
cine does not relieve, it is the
wrong one. This is simple com-
mon sense.
ilost womanly derangements
spring from congestion or a catarrh-
al irritation of the mucous mem- j
brane lining the pelvic organs.
The remedy which reaches, heals
and strengthens this delicate lining,
will stop tlie weakening drainsj
<#Drrect painful irregularities, heal
all inflammation, and irritation.
Such a medicine is Pe-ru-na.
Hundreds of strong, healthy wo-
rien con testify to its wonderful
efficiency. It is just as good for
the girl in the teens as it is for her
mother, and it will prove an excel-
lent tonic for both.
Pe-m-na is not an experiment
Its result is not an uncertainty.
It lives up to its claims, and
faithfully nsed rarely fails to effect
a permanent care.
A fair trial will prove this.

Massachusetts is not noted for her forests, but after
all she appears to have woods to burn, for a recent
forest fire in the State is said to have swept over
sixty square miles, being checked only by the oppor
tune, coming of a heavy rain. Evidently there are
more lands than California' where a forest is regarded
as a gift of God and "its destruction as something
providential that should not be guarded against any
more than a law of nature.
A writer who claims to have gone through the rec
ords says that in Chicago there were last year heard
before the courts 711 cases of fights between hus
bands and wives and that broomsticks were used by
the wives twice as often as any other weapon, so the
old joke about the broomstick has a statistical basis}
Bryan', It is said, is now dodging the issues of the
national campaign. It is safe to say that he will not
be asked to display any particular agility in dodging
votes on election day.
Fresno Republican.
The acquittal of Fred Himes, the boy
murderer, calls attention to a defect in
the law that should be remedied. Here Is
a boy guilty beyond doubt of the gravest
crime known to the law, who goes scot
free because there is no legal provision
to meet his case. If he had been a petty
thief, brawler, merely an incorrigible
youth who gave promise of growing up
to be a worthless man, he would have
been convicted at once and sent to spend
his minority where society would be safe
from him and he would have an oppor
tunity to reform, if reform is in him. If
he had been even an ordinary murderer
he would have been sent to the peniten
tiary or the reform school during his
minority. But because his crime is the
most heinous of Â¦ all, the only form of
murder in which there is no second degree,
he goes free.
There was nothing else to do, of
course. To hang so young a boy or im
prison him for life is out of the question,
and since the law provides no other way
it is not the business of the jury to make
one by subterfuge. But there ought to
be a way. It is , no kindness to a boy
mentally well developed and morally so
weak that he can deliberately poison his
father and feel never a twinge to turn
him loose on the world to solve for him
self the problem of building a life on so
unpromising a, beginning. It is not safe to
society to have "it known abroad that
murder can be committed with impunity
provided the murderer Is young. Â¦ And it
is not right that our laws should be total
ly inadequate to meet such emergencies

GALVESTON TORNADO'S
VERY QUEER FREAKS
Now. take the article of salt and its price as an ex
ample. Germany owns all the salt mines, as Bryan
wants the Government here to own all the mines.
Consul Warner, at Leipzig, in his official report
for July 21. iooo. says that the price of salt in Ger
many. fixed by the Government, was $2 07 per 120
pound?. The Government attributes an advance from
R marks to R.70 marks to increase in the wages of la
bor.
In this country the salt product is handled by cor
porations. 3nd there is" said to be a salt trust. But
salt ?ells in Chicago, in barrel% at 35 cents per hun
dred, against Si. 725 PÂ«" lÂ°Â° pounds at the Government
mines ir. g Germany. Germany pays $1,375 per 100
pounds more for Government salt than Americans pay
frÂ»r corporation salt, and the labor which produces
corporation salt here is paid nearly three times as
tnr.ch as that which produces Government salt in
Germany.
Yes. preat thing. Government ownership; great
thing, Bryanism; great man, Bryan!
SF.YIokAL of Colonel Bryan's platforms de
m?r.d Government ownership of production
and distribution, the instruments of commerce,
lie addresses the downtrodden cotton planters who
.'re fretting 10 cents a pound for their cotton, and the
rjtrodden people who wear cotton because they pay
too much: the laborer is told of oppression because
he pays too much for his bread, and the farmer be
cause he cots too little for his wheat, and the remedy
he offers is Government action, public ownership,
free silver and "a more and a fittener currency" in
the form of an unlimited issue of greenbacks. He
Â«omplains loudly that all prices are under trust con
trol and the people .ire oppressed thereby, from the
feathers that ftuff their pillows to the salt sprinkled
on their meat.
In one of his recent speeches, squirting at Govern
ment ownership, he said: "We should not be afraid
to copy anything that is pood in the policy of other
nations." No, of course not: quite otherwise.

A CASE OF CLOTTED GALL.
OF all the exhibitions of gall ever made by poli
ticians of this or any other country that of the
Democratic State Convention at Saratoga
was the worst. The convention was dominated by
Croker. The Tammany boss ruled it openly. There
was no secret about the domination, for it was mani
fested brutally and boastfully at every step, from the
selection of chairman to the nomination for Gov
ernor, and yet the convention adopted a platform de
nouncing trusts and specifically condemning the "ice
trust," of which Croker is one of the chief organizes,
and among those stockholders are Mayor Van Wyck
and several other Tammany officials.
The trust plank in the platform reads thus: "We
condemn the corporate combination known as the
'ice trust' and denounce all combinations of capital
known as 'trusts' as inevitably and intolerably unjust
to both producer and consumer. By substituting for
the natural laws of commerce the arbitrary dictates
of selfish greed prices are reduced to the producer
'and increased to the consumer to the extreme limit,
to provide enormous dividends upon fictitious capital
values. To accentuate the evil the policy of trusts, in
restricting production, deprives thousands, who under
legitimate conditions would be profitably employed,
of all opportunity to earn a livelihood in the calling
or occupation to which they have been trained. The
direct effect of these immense combinations of capital
in control of every industry is to destroy all individual
enterprise, and to rob the young men of the country
of the free field and fair competition which in demo
cratic times constituted the great glory of the nation
and permitted the advancement and independence of
our youth 'without any favoritism and without any
other requisite aids than merit, honesty and industry-"
Now if you were a resident .of New York and had
been cinched by the ice trust into paying an extor
tionate price for what is a necessity of life in that
sweltering city; and if in your fight against the trust
there had been revealed the fact that Tammany offi
cials controlled it and manipulated it for their profit:
and if those very officials should at the next election
denounce themselves and ask you to vote for themâ
wouldn't it jar you? Wouldn't it make you mad?
That is the bluff Tammany has put up in New-
York. It is aprainst that the voters have to go. When
it comes to gall, the devil himself can hardly beat
Dick Croker.

FOR THE BEST MEN.
WITH the nomination of candidates for State
and county offices the local campaign will enter
upon its final phase. The issues will then be
made up. the platforms adopted and the tickets of the
different parties nominated. There will remain noth
i::K more than for the people to pass judgment upon
the questions and the candidates submitted to them,
and then on election day make known their choice.
At this i-jncture it is appropriate The Call should
repeat what it stated at the very outset of the cam
paign and has announced more than once since that
time. The Call will not support a bad man for any
office. It will not advocate the election of a crooked
politician to the Legislature, nor the election of
an unfit man to a judicial office. There is but one
v..5y to e^tablith honesty in politics, and that is for
the per.p'e to vote honestly for honest men. That is
the rule we counsel for all voters; it is the rule we
follow.
From the first The Call announced that honesty
would be its policy, and pave due notice to all that it
n-ould not 'â¢land for any kind of corruption or dishon
est}- that happened to be labeled "Republican."
Where such practices have brought about the nomi
uation of had men on the Republican ticket The Call
will not only oppose those men. but if their Demo
cratic opponents be good men The Call will advocate
the election of the Democrats.
Devoting itself to honesty in politics, The Call will
hew to the line, let the chips fall where they may.
The -.Treat principles and policies of the Republican
party, for which The Call stands and of which it has
ever been a consistent champion, are not to be ad
vanced by voting for crooked politicians for the Leg
i'hture or for judicial offices. No intelligent Repub
lic.in will permit his faith in protection and sound
money to mislead him into believing he must vote for
a rascal who professes to believe the same thing; nor
can any loyal Republican consent to vote under any
circumstances for a man who in office would disgrace
the party by official corruption.
So far at the nation is concerned the fight against
Bryanisrn if a fipht for the preservation of prosper
ity and good povernmtnt. and ever}- Republican and
every independent voter should support the Republi
can ticket for Congressmen and for Presidential
Electors. For the local interests of the county and the
State there are needeJ Rood judges and honest legis
lators. In pursuing The policy of voting for the best
man nothing; will be done to jeopardize the success
of national Republicanism. That fact must be
dear to all. Let the people scrutinize both tickets
well. Let no dishonest man be elected.

PERSONAL MENTION.
_â ,TJCLID MARTIN, a leader of the
V7 Democratic party in Omaha, â¢Post
r Â¦ master during the last term of Pres-
ident Cleveland and for years chalr
Â¦^* man of the Democratic State Com
mittee, Is stronger In his opposition to. Mr.
Bryan's candidacy this year than he was
in 1S96. Four years ago Mr. Martin denied
his support to Bryan because he could not
assent to the financial legislation prom
ised by the Chicago platform; this year he
finds the same objection to the Kansas
City platform, and in addition observes
other reasons for making the defeat of the
Democratic candidate desirable. Mr. Mar
tin sends the following:
Editor San Francisco Callâ In the pres
ent political situation I am' unable to dis
cover any grood reason why a Democrat
favoring, a stable currency who refused to
support Bryan in 1896 should support him
now. His prophecies and predictions as a
candidate in 1896 are unfulfilled, and the
disasters which he announced ag sure to
follow the election of Mr. McKinley have
failed to materialize.
The platform of 1900, It seems to me. is
in no wise better than that of 1S96, and in
some instances it is worse. I regard the
continued agitation of the 16 to 1 fallacy
as detrimental to the best interests of the
country, and the attempt to make an Is
sue out of imperialism is entirely abortive.
While maintaining a high appreciation
of the personal qualifications of the fusion
candidates. I am constrained to say that
I believe a Presidential candidate should
be a man of loftier purposes and pursuits
than a continuous politician Interested in
his own advancement. Very truly you".

NEW YORK CORRESPONDENT:
C, <". CABLTOS Herald Square
TO DEFEAT BELSHAW
HERRIN ; of the Southern Pacific has not yet
abandoned his fight against C. M. Belshaw.
The failure of his efforts to prevent Mr.. Bel
shaw's nomination for the Senate by the Republicans
of the Eleventh District has had no other effect than
that of making him change the field of his opera
tions from the Republican to the Democratic camp.
Mr. Herrin and his gang are no longer Republicans
in that district. They have become Bryanites for the
time being, and have induced J. H. Wilkins of Marin
County, a popular Democrat, to assist them to defeat
Mr. Belshaw before the people.
It can hardly be necessary to remind the voters of
the Eleventh Senatorial District of the causes which
have led Herrin and the railroad bosses generally to
make so persistent and so earnest's fight against Bel
shaw. It is well known that when the railroad under
took to send to the United States Senate a notoriously
corrupt boss, who in the Senate would have dishon
ored the State and the office and served only the rail
road, Mr. Belshaw was one of the. most faithful and
efficient supporters of the cause of the people, the
honorÂ«of the State, and the credit of the Republican
part}'. Herrin could not ; *'"control Belshaw's vote
cither by coaxing, by threats;or by promises of rail
road favor. Thereupon the name of Mr. Belshaw was
placed upon the political blacklist of the Southern
Pacific Company and orders were given to fight him
at every opportunity. '
While Mr. Belshaw was a candidate for the Repub
lican nomination in the-Eleventh District the railroad
bosses resorted to every sort of tactics, foul or fair,
to beat him. At that time Herrin posed as a Repub
lican doing Republican politics. He was urgent in
counseling this man or that man to get in and beat
Belshaw. His efforts were in vain. The Republicans
o? the district stood firmly by the man who in office
stood firmly by them. The bosses were beaten, and
now we have the spectacle of those same bosses turn
ing up in the Democratic camp and doing politics
there just as if they had made no pretense of being
Republicans,
The open audacity with which the Southern Pacific
bosses have transferred their activities from the Re
publican to the Democratic camp is another proof that
the railroad cares nothing about politics in the higher
sense of the word and has no regard for parties fur
ther than it can make use of them to promote the
election of men who in office Will serve the railroad
and do what the bosses tell them.
In the present instance Herrin is well aware that he
cannot defeat Belshaw without the aid of a popular
candidate^ and for that reason he has turned to Mr.
Wilkins. Such is the situation that confronts the
voters of the district. Personally and in his private
business Wilkins is a good man, but he has entered
this contest as a representative of the railroad chosen
to defeat a man whom the railroad could not and can
not control. Wilkins' nomination by the Democrats
was urged by Herrin, and Wilkins has been promised
the support of the railroad bosses. It is not likely that
support was given without a pledge, either express or
implied, of reciprocity on the part of the candidate. If
Herrin serve Wilkins in the campaign, he will expect
Wilkins to return the favor should he be elected.
The friends of Mr. Wilkins will be surprised to see
him act the part of a railroad tool in such a
and it is to be regretted that he has done so. In any
event the people have a safe recourse against the ma
chinations of Herrin. They have only to vote for
Mr. Belshaw to assure themselves and the State of the
service of a Senator whom the railroad can neither
control nor defeat.

EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
BRYAN AND JEFFERSON.
COLONEL BRYAN, as a protean artist, is at the
footlights, in the fierce glare of publicity, pre
senting himself alternately in imitations of Jef
ferson, Jackson and Lincoln. "Imitations," did we
say? No. He professes alternate reincarnations of
those worthies.
In his speech at Columbus he announced a fine and
natural materialization of Jefferson, with the fidd'.n
which that statesman played with skill and effect
He cited the Porto Rican measure as evidence of
imperialism, and, posing like Ajax, cried out: "That
bill cannot exist except upon an imperialistic theory
of government. I challenge you to find in all the his
tory of the world a power exercised by a tyrant or
despot more arbitrary than the power asserted by the
Porto Rican bill."
This was hailed with "great applause." That is
right. Nothing brings greater applause than smashing
the jaw of the tyrant and despot with a figure of
speech. Nor was it the first time that denunciation of
the theory of the Porto Rican bill had been greeted
by great applause. With a single exception that bill
h almost an exact copy of the Louisiana bill adopted
during JefTeribn's administration for that territory
newly acquired from France. For nearly a year Jeffer
son governed Louisiana as commander and chief of
the army and navy. His government was purely execu
tive, using the army as its instrument. Then Con
gress took up the problem and passed the original
of the Porto Rico bill. When it was put in operation
the people of Louisiana sent a memorial to Congress
in which they said: "Shall we be called on to show
that this government is inconsistent with every prin
ciple of civil liberty? Is it necessary for us to demon
strate that this act does not incorporate us in the
Union, that it vests us with none of the rights, gives
us no advantages and deprives us of the immunities of
American citizens? This Governor is vested with all
executive and almost unlimited legislative 'power.
The council operates as a cloak to conceal the extent
of his authority, and to give us a faint resemblance of
representative assembly."
This memorial was strongly backed by the enemies
of Jefferson. He was accused of inoculation with the
imperial views of Burr, who, following the lines o?
General Wilkinson's report on the Mississippi region,
indulged in certain movements which indicated his
purpose to found an empire in that region and caused
his trial for treason.
That Louisiana memorial was referred to a commit
tee of Congress, which reported, through John Ran
dolph of Roanoke, that: "The grievances complained
of by the memorialists are of a nature inseparable
from those sudden transitions to which late political
events have subjected the .people of Louisiana."
For seven years Louisiana continued to be gov
erned by that law denounced as subversive of popular
rights and imperialistic in its purpose. It goes with
out saying that if at any time during that period the
best interests and the permanent welfare of the Union
had been proven to require the alienation of Louisi
ana, that territory could have been relinquished, cut
loose and consigned to destiny independent of that of
the rest of the continent.
Jefferson never pretended that the constitution fol
lowed the flag into the Louisianas. After the terri
torial novitiate, under the law denounced as tyran
nical and despotic, Louisiana was brought wholly un
der the constitution and its immunities and privileges
extended to her people.
The Philippines are in the same position as was
Louisiana, although Colonel Bryan contends that they
are wholly under the constitution. They are held
where the American people can take tests of the de
sirability of retaining them. The treaty of Paris puts
them in that position, and owes jts ratification to the
lobbying done by Colonel Bryan. It is not unlikely
that the future decision of the people will be against
their permanent retention, but that decision will be
reached in deliberation and not in hysterics. It will
be reached not because of Bryan's yelping about-im
perialism and bearing false witness against his coun
try. It will be reached when the lobbyist for the pur
chase of the islands cannot be made President by de
nouncing that purchase. It will be reached regard
less of his spumy ambition, his smart Aleckism, his
demagogy and hypocrisy. It will be reached after his
show is off the circuit and the protean artist of
American politics has dropped to his proper place of
orator at county fairs and the choice of committees
to present the church fair ring cake to the hand
somest young lady, to whom it has been voted at 10
cents a ballot.
Colonel Bryan is ignorant of history, is ignorant of
past analogies to the public issues which he now dis
cusses, and is lacking in profound knowledge of any
thing except the arts of the demagogue and agitator.
In these he is past master.
It i? a fact that the conscientious anti-expansionists
deplore his voluble and voluntary advocacy of their
cause. They feel his presence as that of a parasite.
and have resented it by the nomination of Senator
Caffery.
Every President he quotes and professes to imitate,
Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln, was denounced as an
imperialist by just such fellows as he.
When Jackson pursued hostile Seminoles into
Florida and found them protected by the Spanish
Governor, to whom he gave a powdery and peppery
piece of his mind, he laid the foundation for charges
of imperialism which gathered further material from
his course in the Presidency, and his enemies car
tooned him as "King Andrew the First" and pursued
him with lampoons and the "coffin handbills." It is
history in Southern Illinois that Bryan's father used
the same language toward Lincoln that the son now
employs against McKinley, and General John C.
Black is authority for the statement that after the
close of the war the Â«lder Bryan made speeches as
serting offensively the constitutional right of secession
and disunion. The Colonel came by his gift of accu-Â»
sation by inheritance, and it is perfectly natural that
his theory of the Philippine question requires a dis
solution of the Union to reduce it to practice.
But for sheer decency's sake he should not parade
Jefferson. Jackson and Lincoln as his ineffable back
ers. If they were ac:iin in the flesh and heard the
same charges, in the same language, employed
against President McKinley that were used against
them, in spite of their dignity they, would cry
"Chestnuts!"

Halnes, Alaska, say that the Porcupine
placers are proving to be far richer than
was anticipated by the first discoverers.
Bedrock has been found In Porcupine
Cree.. only, leaving- the value of adjacent
creeks still a matter of speculation. There
are nine claims on Porcupine Creek and
Its immediate tributaries now being
worked. No. 2. below Discovery, was
opened by a prospect hole ten by twenty
feet. At thirty feet no bedrock was found,
though the gravel yielded pay averaging
$50 to the cubic yard. On Discovery,
owned by "Jack" Dalton and associates,
twelve men are employed working: night
and day shifts. Georpe Black, who owned
a fourth interest, recently sold out to Dal
ton at a reported price of $35,000.
A new discovery that promises to equal
Porcupine Is located on the Tlaku. on Big
Salmon River. Just across the divide from
the head of Porcupine Creek, and wholly

that its low bars and old channels will b

Pressure for currency is not expected by

The Jewish people of San Francisco cel
rl rated yesterday one of the most fmpor
t':t days in the calendar of their ecclc
rtastSeal year. It was the dawn of the
Hebrew new year, the beginning of the
year ii-01 since the world bepan. Men.
women and children of all shades of or

until sundown to-right. The season is
for them penJtentiaJ and they observe it
In the deejx-st of religious feeling.
In the temple at Stockton and Califor
nia streets yesterday an absolutely ortho
dox service was performed. The ritual
and liturgy were the ancient and impres
sive ores of the Jewish rare. There was
to the strange and age-honored service a
dignity which all felt. The solemn
chants, the menotone of the chapiter and
the silent worshiping figures of hundreds
of men and women, separated In obedl
tr.ee to ancient custom, gave to the scene
a deep solemnity.
At 6:30 o'clock in th<Â» morning the cele
r.ratioti of the feast day began and con
tinued without interruption until 12:30
o'clrvk. under the direction of Rev. D.

of the management of the popular little

Weekly Ministerial Meet
ings Well Attended.
Â» Â¦
The Rev. Thomas Fraser created a
sensation at the Presbyterian Ministerial
Union yesterday by informing the min
isters present that the denomination was
losing Its hold on the people. The dis
course which created surprise in the minds
of "the ministers present was based on
the subject "California as I Knew It Forty
Years Ago." At the outset Dr. Fraser
dwelt on the earnestness and the energy
which characterized the work of the Pres
byterians in the early days. To prove his
assertion he called attention to the fact
that the Presbyterians recently aban
doned four churches, and were even now
considering the advisability of consolidat
ing two more. He asserted that negotia
tions were pending with this object in
view. He called attention to the fact
that the local Presbyterians had allowed
San Rafael to capture the theological
seminary which was organized in this city
and was known as the Pacific College. â¢
Dr. Fraser added more evidence to back
his statement by saying that the local
members of the denomination had allowed
the people of Oregop to capture the Gen
eral Assembly, and as a rtnal authority
called attention to the disappearance of
the Occident, the denominational paper
on this coast. He said that all this was
humiliating to him. and he expressed the
hope that greater energy and greater
earnestness would be injected Into the
work of the church.
The Rev. E. A. Woods, pastor of the
First Baptist Church, read an Interesting
theological paper before his brethren on
"Anthromortism." In tne course of his
paper he said: "God has revealed himself
blessed in nature, in the Bible and in the
human soul. While man's nature lias
been deformed and shattered by sin, It
Is really a reflection of the character of
God."
The Rev. J. N. Beard was elected pres
ident of the Methodist Episcopal Mlnia
ters' Union. D. M. Buck, the new pastor
of Trinity M. E. Church, was elected vice
president and the Rev. Fay Donaldson
was chosen secretary. A physical culture
discourse with illustrations entertained
the ministers during their session.
The ConRreRational .ministers listened to
a paper on "The Church of the Future
by tho Rev. Mr. Kidd of San Mateo. The
discourse was on the attitude of the
church with reference to Jesus Christ, ser
vices and soclolosry.
The State Association of Congregational
Churches of Northern California will hold
its annual meeting in Cloverdale October
2 to October 6. Sessions will be held morn
lnsr, afternoon and evening and prominent
ministers of the denomination will tako

Describes the Murders Committed by
Her Father-in-I^LW and Her
Own Narrow Escape
From Death.
PLACERVILLE, Sept. 24.-Several wit
nesses for the prosecution were examined
In the Zumwalt . murder case to-day,
among whom was Hose Zumwalt, for the
murder of whose husband the defendant is
being tried. Henry Zumwalt. one of the
defendant's sons, testified that he saw
and conversed -with his father in May last,
when the elder man asked him whether he
and his wife would come and live In the
place adjoining George if he should buy It
for them. The witness answered that his
wife opposed the moVe, whereupon the de
fendant replied that he would then make
a thinning out there some day, as he was
tired of the way things wero going at
George's home.

defendant's strange actions. She further
admitted that George threatened three
days before the tragedy to make his
father leave the place, and her trip to
Placerville with Julia Zumwalt that after
noon was to obtafn counsel in respect to
the trouble between her husband and the
defendant over the property on which

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 24.â The Southern
California Methodist Conference listened
to reports on the spiritual condition of

Bishop Hamilton was presented with a
handsome floral offering by the ladies of
the Women's Christian Temperance
Union, and in an address of thanks de
clared himself in favor of woman suf
frage.

IMMIGRATION FRATTDS.
Wholesale Naturalization of Japan
ese at Vancouver.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. Sept. 24.â A deep-laid plot
to defraud the Dominion Government de
veloped to-day in the examination of
eleven Japanese, who were charged with
having falsely sworn to their signatures
on naturalization papers. One Japanese
had arrived in Vancouver in March and
was naturalized the following June. He
created a sensation in court by declar
ing that he had never appeared before
the notary in his life. He said that he
had gone to Skeena River on a fishing
trip, and while there had received the
blue paper, which he was told to keep.
A Japanese contractor had obtained this
for him and he did not even know what
It meant. The paper evidently had been
forged with the name of the witness, and
the whole unlawful transaction, including
tiÂ»e sworn declaration that he had lived
In the country for four years and was
entitled to fishing and other privileges,
was carried out without the knowledge of
the man whose name appeared on the
paper and who was charged with offense.
The Attorney General's department will
to-morrow issue warrants for the arrest
of several wealthy Japanese labor con
tractors who have railroaded through such
a large number of their countrymen.

describe, and the damage to property and
the losses of Individuals were outside the
possibility of computation. Though the
fury of the wind bad abated somewhat
and the tremendous tide had partially re
ceded, the angry waters still raged like
a legion of furfcs; monster waves pound
ed and dashed against the city, while an
untold quantity of debris â lumber, piles,
wreckage of ships, barrels of liquor, tents,
sails, masts, building paper, portions of
buildingsâ covered the surface of the near
waters and tumbled about in wild con
fusion with the impetus of the surf. Thou
sands of people braved the elements to
feast their eyes upon a scene which will
leave an everlasting impression on the
memories of all.
Worst of all was the loss of life which
attended the storm. Eight men are known
to have been lost. Thousands of people
were bereft of their small belongings and
rendered homeless by the washing away
of their tents and houses. What the to
tal losses by the storm will foot up can
not be computed definitely. Reporters
who have gone carefully over the district
and obtained, as nearly as possible, esti
mates of the individual losses are satisfied
that the whole will foot up fully JaOO.OOO.
The flrst disaster of ttie fierce storm
was the coming ashore of the Alaska
CommtTCial Company's barge York,
which was heavily laden with winter pro
visions. This occurred about 2:30 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. At 3:30 o'clock the
southeaster was piping a gale and tho
mammoth barge Bkookum, proudest and
etanchest of all the storm-tossed fleet,
dragged her anchors and started on the
Journey toward the beach and destruc
tion. After the Skookum had dragged
an hour or so the little tug America and
a steam launch which were tied astern of
the doomed barge began to show signs of
succumbing to the heavy sea. They
popped and bobbed about on the crest of
the swells until both were caught broad-
BidÂ© In the sea. Over they turned and
shot headlong to the bottom. Captain
Madison and the engineer of the tug are
believed to have gone down to a watery
grave. Nobody seems to know whether
or not the captain and engineer were
aboard the foundered tug, but all efforts
to locate them last night and to-day
proved futile.
The thirteen men aboard the Skookum
succeeded In finally getting ashore on a
lighter, some with serious injuries, but
without loss of life.
Captain Peterson's and Lane's lighters
all came ashore and played havoc with
the rear of several Front-street buildings
above and below the Alaska Commercial
Company plant. C. D. Lane's tug Islam
shared the fate of the America. The cap
tain of the Islam and two men lost their
lives. The schooner Prosper is a wreck
and Captain Gelser and one seaman have
found a watery grave. .
In endeavoring to cross Snake. Andrew
A. Ryan's small boat was overturned and
Ryan lost his life. He had purchased a
ticket and had Intended to leave In a day
or two for his home In Los Angeles,
where he leaves a widow and two grown
daughters. His body has not been re
covered.
The brunt of the storm and tide was
sustained by the low beachland extend
ing from the- office of the KImball Steam
ship Company west to tne Spit and up Riv
er street alone the banks of Snake River.
There the waters covered every foot of
beach to tho high ground on the north
side of the district. River street became
submerged to a depth of several feet.
With the sudden rising of the tide the
monster breakers came surging 1 In from
the sea, carrying ruin nnd destruction be
fore them. Buildings along the south side
of River street were carried a distance of
two blocks and dashed against those on
the opposite side. Among the prominent
buildings lost were the Riverside saloon,
Just completed three weeks ago by Walter
Barrleau; the Riverside printing office, the
Theatre Comlque building, Meyer's shoe
shop and residence, a new business build
ing Just completed by T. J. Nester, Tony
Tubbs restaurant and that of a company
of Japanese; D. Ramsey's building, used
as a barber shop; Star Laundry, Camp
bell s secondhand store, Hammond's pho
tograph gallery, Fred Aiker's news stand
the Seattle store, the Nome Pure Water
Company's building, the cold storage
plant and brewery, tho Baltimore House,
one of the handsomest structures on the
street, and several others.
Everything up to the Baltimore was
wrecked, while beyond that the balance
of the buildings along the river bank
were flooded. Only in a few instances
were stocks and other goods even partial
ly saved, so unexpected and sudden was
the onslaught of the waves.
On the Spit across the way tho destruc
tion of property was complete to a point
up to Dr. Grepg's private hospital. The
place was fairly crowded with tents and
small- frame buildings,, and, hundreds of
people made their homes there. Various
estimates are heard of the number of per
sons rendered homeless by the waters and
the general opinion is that 1000 Is a rea
sonable figure. That many of these un
fortunate ones will suiter severely is un
doubted. A serious loss to the camp Is
the 10,000 tons of coal drawn Into the sea.
Owing to the lateness of the season, this
may not be replaced and the supply of
fuel for the winter will be that much
short. ' Â¦

A Great Day at This Pretty Eesort.
The number of people who are induced
by cheap excursion rates to take short
trips Into the country every now and
then almost surpasses belief. During the
summer outing season . now nearlng Its
close thp Souther Pacific has carried
nearly one hundred thousand people to
popular picnic grounds or resorts near by
and brought them all back happier, bet
ter and with a keen desire to go again.
On Sunday next Santa Cruz will te
objective point, and It will be a surprise
to every one if on that occasion the ag
gregate number is not swelled by several
thousands. Santa Cruz Is one of the most
favorable places in the State for just such
an outing, and no short trip3 the world
over possess such a variety of attrac
tions. Excursionists will have five or six
hours on the beach and a number of brief
.stops at the pretty nooks in the Santa

Round trip tickets will be $2. and you

At the request of the members of the
Mercantile Library! the trustees of that
institution have Issued a call for a special
meeting to be held on Thursday evening,
when the matter of chanr.ng the present
location of the library will be thoroughly
discussed. The old rooms of the Y. M. C.
A. on Sutter street have been mentioned
as the new headquarters for the library,
and while the trustees have Inspected the
place and expressed their approval of the
new location nothing definite has been
clone In the matter.
As matters stand at present the affairs
of the library are apparently hopelessly
involved. The indebtedness of the insti
tution is not very . much below $76,000.
Removal would necessarily Involve a large
outlay, which the conservative members
are rather averse to incur, when it is con
sidered that a down-town library Is not
sure to refill the depleted treasury of the
institution. Other members again favor
consolidation with the Mechanics' Insti
tute Library. Opposition to the proposed
consolidation comes chiefly frqm the older
members of the Institute, who, though
willing to accept the books of the Mercan
tile, together with its large membership,
are not willing to add "Mercantile" to its
name.
If the Mercantile Is doomed to lose Its
Identity and its name, many of its mem
bers argue that it would be better to do
nate the Mercantile books to the San
Francisco Public Library.
However, all members will have a
chance to air their opinions on the matter
on Thursday evening, when a lively ses
sion with probably some beneficial results
Is confidently looked for.
Consolidation With Mechanics' Insti
tute or Donation of Books to the
Public Library Also Con
sidered.
Library Trustees Will Dis
cuss the Matter With
Members.

(Concluded.) v :-\
The story of Fremont's life brings us
also the account of a third expedition to \
the west. It is the story of the explora- j
tlon of Nevada and of. the conques: of
California. After he had reached th^ val
ley of the San Joaquin he left his party, |
while he himself went to Monterey, then
the capital of the province, to obtain sup- |
plies and the permission of the Mexican ;
Government to continue hl3 . explorations. ;
He was ordered out of the country, and j
was proceeding . northward to Oregon, j
when word came of the outbreak of the i
Mexican war, and Fremont was ordered '
to protect American interests In Caluor- '
n!a. In co-operation with Camniodore* j
Stockton and Sloat. Fremont added mate- |
I'ally In securing California for America, j
He was elected Governor of California ly I
the American settlers. on July 4, 1S46, and !
in 1S47 he was made military commander j
and civil governor by the Washingtci i
Government. In that year (1S-17) he con- '
eluded articles of capitulation with Mex*
ico by which California became a perma
nent American possession.
But if we were to have California and
Oregon we must have the right of way to
reach these new Pacific possessions. It
was thought that by the South Pass emi
grant trains could reach the Northwest.
But to reach southern and central Cali
fornia it was necessary that we have
New Mexico and Arizona. The tide of mi
gration could find a better route, shorter
and In a. more temperate climate, by fol
lowing ihe thirty-fourth parallel through
the center of New Mexico, reaching tno
Pacific near Los Angeles. Here was a re
gion that had yet to be made known. Pika
had revealed but little concerning It. A
few years after Pikeâ in 151*â Major L<on?.
sent by President Monroe, had explored
the valley of the Platte. Following the
south fork of the Platte, after a Journey
of more than 1000 miles, Long cams to the
mountains, in July, 1S20, and he left
Longs Peak on the map as a memorial
of the Journey* Long went still farther
south to the region below the upper Ar
kansas, but he brought the world but lit
tle knowledge of the plains and plateaus
of New Mexico and Arizona. To conquer
this region and hold it for our own as a
means of access to California was consid
ered of great importance. With this end
in view General Kearny marched from
Fort Leavenworth in June, 1S46, for Santa
Fe. Among his motley force was a bard
of Mormons, and Parker says "there was
something striking in the half-military,
half-patriarchal appearance of these
armed fanatics, thus on their way, with
their wives and children, to find a Mor
mon Canaan in California." Kearny
inarched over the old trail through El
Moro and Las Vegas. San Miguel and old
Pecos, and without opposition on August
8. 1S46, he unfurled the Stars and Stripes
over the Mexican palace of Santa Fe.
Kearny continued his march with a
part of his men through Arizona to the
Pacific. On his way he met Kit Carson,
the famous scout and guide, who was on
his way to Washington as a fcourler with
dispatches from Fremont. A word only
as to this famous courier: Kit Carson,
one of the most picturesque characters ot
American history, was born In Kentucky
In 1S09. While still an mfant he was
taken by his parents to the wilds of Mis
souri. At the age of 15 he began the
hunter's life which gave him the training
that enabled him afterward to render dis
tinguished services to his country. No
white man was better known among the
Indians and none knew better than he the
Indian life and character; arrQ it has been
truthfully said that no man did more than
Carson to further the settlement of the
Northwestern wilderness. In both the
Mexican and civil wars he. rendered great
service to the Government as scmit and
guide and courier, and much of the suc
cess of Fremont's expeditions was due to
his faithfulness and knowledge.
Time will not permit to tell the story of
Marcus Whitman and how he saved Ore
gon. But our account would be Inade
quate without some reference to the early
missionary whose early labors and ex
plorations contributed so much to our
knowledflp and possession of the North
west. Wnen the four Nez Perces Indians
visited St. Louis In 1S33. asking that the
DISCOVERERS AND E J>C rÂ»L-O R E PiS Of INORTH
AmERlCA.
Bible should be sent to their people, the
Christian churches of America were
aroused to activity. In 1S34 the Methodist
board of missions sent out the Revs. Jason
and Daniel Lee. The next year, 1S35. Dr.
Marcus .Whitman went to Oregon under
the direction of the American board for
the Congregational church. Whitman de
tected \he purpose of the Hudson Bay
Company to colonize Oregon in EnsHsh
interest and he determined to forestall the
plan by a counter movement. American
migration must be hastened or Oregon
would be lost. "Without a day's delay
AÂ« hitman started to carry to the Govern
ment at Washington the hews of the peril
to Oregon, and as the result of his deter
mination Whitman's heroic rid* has be

Here was a Christian endeavnrer who
faced the winter, the mountains, the

of the market on accour.t of a settlement tor
the conning year cf the schedule ol wages. The
â¢whole croup yielded to some extent, with the
later weakness- in the market. The rally In
the market was due in no small part to cover
ing demand Irom the shorts and to the absence
:run the board room of some cf the Influen
tial bear traders on account of the Jewish
IxJtdiy. The resumption of mining in some
of the coal rr.ir.es had another bracing effect
on the n-arket. and published statÂ«nents of
the reserves detracted somewhat from the un
ta^ir.eeE ovfr the effects of the strike, but there
was no radical change in the spirit of the spec
ulation an-1 the undertone of sentiment con
tinued d(-c!dedly apprehensive of the future of
the money market. The failure of a etock
exchange firm was unimportant in Itself, but
the exhaustion of customers' margins and their
failures to extend them, which was assigned
as the cause, attracted pome attention. It is
a matter of notoriety that many brokers have
demanded an extension of margins from their
customers and no small part of last week's
liquidation is attributed to this cause. In the
money market interest rates were not changed.
1'Ut ihe outgo to the interior continues on a
nv^ral scale. The growth of stringency In
the foreign markets, especially London and
Berlin, promises renewed pressure upon New
York !'>r e^-i. although the bills of commer
dj exchar.pe In the market to-day were suffi
ci*r.t to depress the Fterlir.ar rate a fraction.
The requirements of the tub- Treasury this week
on the regular Government revenue are prom
ised to be larger than last week, and added to
rr . exact ions u;x>n the money market.

NEW YORK, Sept. 24.â The market received
Â»iorr.e eupport from sundry causes at times to-
Cay and prices were at one time lifted to a
level quite substantially over that of Saturday
at Â«.r.y time. Weakness persisted In tome
:::â¢..;,.. stocks and the announcement of a
t-rr-a!l failure early In the afternoon put a
stop to the advancing tendency of prices so
that the closing was h*a.vy and dull with only
a Jew net cmlna remaining. The special points
of we&kntrbs were People's Gas and Brooklyn
Tra.r.s>it, the former dropping below S3 before
tfae cl^se and later touching H, the low prices
la the recent movement. The late weakness
had a. sympathetic enÂ«?ci among the special

W. W. Morrison, Dr. H. N. Rowell and
T. F. Mock, members of the Republican
County Central Committee, have taken
the Initiative in the matter of issuing a
call for a conference of the entire commit
tee looking toward a harmonizing of the
differences which have split that body in
twain. These members have asked the en
tire committee to meet Wednesday after
noon at 1 o'clock at Judge Quinn's court
room- for this conference, the meeting, it
is declared in the call, to be Informal.
This action is the result of efforts which
have been made by prominent members of
the party who during the past two weeks
have been planning some harmonizing
steps. The call alms especially and solely
to that end. The time for the session Is
fixed for the day followlnsr the regular
meeting night of the Breed wing of the
committee. The date was chosen, it is be
lieved, that the Breed organization might
have time to fully canvass the call and
decide what steps they should take. None
of the commltteemen who signed the call
have recognized the Breefl organization.
Whether the conference shall be success
ful rests largely upon the decision of the
Breed forces as to a recognition of the
call. The call 1Â« as follows:

The Hebrew festival of the new year
was observed In Oakland to-day by spe

and reform Jews alike closed their stores
and the business portion of the city pre
sented a Sunday appearance. The festi
val was ushered In last evening at sun
down and ended this evening, though there
will be special praise services in the syna
gogues to-morrow.
The services at the synagogue of the
First Hebrew Congregation this morning
were conducted by Rabbi M. Friedlander.
who was assisted by E. Bernstein and
Marcus Jonas. Mr. Jonas blew the shofar.
an impressive portion of the service. J.
Rosenberg and Sol Kahn. president and
vice president of the congregation, occu
pied seats at the altar.
Rabbi Friedlander took for the subject
of his sermon "The Omnipresence of
God." his text being "Bless ye the Lord,
all his works In all places of his domin
ion; bless the Lord, O my souL"â Psalms.
3:22. He said:
"To-day is New Year, and It stands
for the full meaning of the word. It la
the day when we pass over from the old
to the new. We reflect on the past and
think of the future. We recount our ex
periences and map out our Intentions. And
It is at this hour, the hour when the
spectacle of our own life is brought to
our view, that the Psalmist speaks to us
of God's omnipresence, thereby appeas
ing our spiritual unrest and soothing our
wounded consciousness.
"No matter how vain and frivolous our
external life may appear at times, there
is a deep-rooted conviction at the bottom
of every human consciousness that lifo
Is something more than a mere air bub
ble. Man stands for something higher
than being the object of a passing show.
Human function comprises wider and
greater significance than merely working,
eating, sleeping. Happiness is a much
more precious and more lasting prize than
that secured by the commonplace strug
gle* after worldly gain."

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Sept. 24.
The long, hard fight of the merchants
of this city against the Alameda tax reg
ulation * - hlch Imposes a license on all
dealers from outside cities delivering
goods within the limits of that munici
pality has at last resulted In their suc
cess. Judge Hall rendered a decision to
day in the case of the city of Alameda
against H. C. Coward, an Oakland salt
merchant, that the license tax imposed
on outside dealers is illegal.
Several months ago Coward drove over
to Alameda with a load of salt for his
customers and submitted himself to ar
rest for the purpose of testlpg the license
ordinance. He was found guilty in the
Alameda Recorder's court and entered
an appeal to the Superior Court.
Attorney Fred W. Fry, who was re
tained by the Oakland merchants, con
tended that the Alameda license ordinance
was illegal because it attempted to Im
pose a license upon merchants simply for
the privilege of delivering goods within
the city to their customers.
The argument made by the Alameda
authorities was that the merchants were
in the business of delivering goods, and
that the laying down of merchandise
within the Alameda city limits was not
merely an Incident of their regular trade.
In his ruling Judre Hall held that the
dtllvery of goods was not" a business In
cases of regularly established merchants,
but merely an Incident.

to say:
"MacRae. in my opinion, did his duty."
Pending the result of the Injury to
Brown, the Alameda authorities will take
no action in the case. MacRae Is much
wrought up over the tragic affair. He
declares he will meet all the expenses en
tailed upon the Brown family as a con
sequence of the shooting.
"While I regret beyond measure this
distressing affair." said MacRae to-day.
"I believe that unuor all of the circum

I ordered Kelly out of the buggy he

The latter team having a preponderance

when by reason of brilliant plays the re
sult appeared doubtful. %

Towne of Minnesota opened the Demo
cratic campaign in Fresno to-night with
an address to an audience of 1500 people
In the Barton Opera-house. The meeting

astic as might bo expected In this county,
which has such a strong Democratic
leaning.
. Tho address at the Barton Opera-house
was taken up almost entirely with a dis
cussion of the Issues of imperialism and
silver. Mr. Towne began with some re
marks on the use and misuse of political
parties and the need of more patriots and
less partisanship. He declared that any
present prosperity was due to natural
causes, not to the administration, and de
nounced the party in power for bringing
about the coal miners' miseries in Penn
sylvania..

CHEYENNE, Wyo.. Sept. 24.â After a
rest of two weeks, the chase after the des
peradoes who robbed a train at Table
Rock last month has been resumed. Last
night United States Marshal Hadsell. at
the head of a large posse, left Rawltns

May Buy ft Water Plant.
SAN .DIEGO. Sept. 24.-In the efforts to
settle the water contest here between the
San Diego "Water Company and a rival
corporation for the control of the business
of supplying the city of San Diego with
water a committee of the City Council has
adopted by unanimous vote a resolution
to recommend the offer to the San I>lego
Water Company by the city of $500,000 for
Its entire plant and property in 8an Diego
to be owned by the city. The resolution
will be presented to the City Council on
Monday night, and if adopted will be sub
mitted to the London owners of the water
plant. Should they accept it all the pres
ent litigation over the $1,500,000 in city
water works bonds declared . invalid by
the'lower court* will be dismissed and an

and improve the present -water works
nlant.
The Board of Supervisors adopted a
resolution yesterday to pay the demand*
of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph
Company for telephones used by the city
government, though McCarthy opposed
the measure on the ground that It was In
violation of the charter. McCarthy quot
ed a provision of the charter which says
that holders of demands against the mu
nicipal government shall not .be paid if
they are Indebted to the city. McCarthy
sald the telephone company owed the city
large sums of money for back license
taxes on their nlckel-In-the-slot machines.
Brandensteln agTeed with McCarthy's
contention that the paying of the de
mands was In clear violation of the law.
"This measure is in direct opposition to
the charter," said Brandensteln. "We
cannot adopt it without overriding the
charter."
Reed said that It was a matter of ex
pediency to pay the telephone demands.
Trouble, he said, would result, as the com
pany would undoubted!*' take out the
'phones if the bills were not paid. In
answer to a question of the Mayor, Reed
said the telephone company owed the city
1200,000 for delinquent license taxes.
McCarthy made light of the threat of
the company to take out the telephones,
but the resolution was adopted and fol
lows:
The Auditor and Treasurer are, directed tc
audit and to pay out of the "telephone fund"
all bills for telephone sen-Ice contracted In
conformity with the agreement of the Pacific
Telephone Company to reduce Its rates on city
individual and extension telephones to $6 per
month and $1 per month respectively. It be
in* also agreed that a sufficient number of
telephones be taken out to come within the
monthly appropriation of S5S3 33, the July, Au
erust and September bills over and above this
amount to be rebated by the company.
When the resolution authorizing the
Civil Service Commission to appoint three
extra clerks for a period of three months
at $100 per month came up Reed moved its
reference to the Civil Service Committee
of the board, which was done. McCarthy
objected to the expenditure on the ground
that the Civil Service Commission was too
expensive an institution.
"The commission has already cost $$000."
said McCarthy, "and has accomplished
little or nothing."
The Mayor stated that the clerks were
already employed, which caused Sander
son to remark that departments should
be compelled to ask for additional heU>
before employing it and not after.
The Public Buildings Committee was
authorized to assign the quarters in the
Hall of Justice to the various criminal de
partments of the courts and also to ap
portion the offices to be vacated in the
City Hall. The committee will reconcile
the differences that have arisen in connec
tion with the moving of the departments,
as certain Superior Judges have an
nounced their intention not to change
their chambers.
The Board of Public Works was directed
to ascertain the estimated cost of com
pleting the Mission police station, with a
view to its immediate occupancy.
The Union-Street Rails.
Instead of granting the petition of Mrs.
Ann E. Reynolds that the tracks of the
Union-street cable road be moved to the
center of the street on that portion be
tween Hyde and Larkln the Board of Su
pervisors adopted a resolution yesterday
providing that the sidewalk in front of
Mrs. Reynolds' premises be cut away four
feet. The board granted the company
They are to constructed that wheels ar*
f>ulled off vehicles. This company is trv
ng to blockade the town by acqmrtafl a!?
these franchises, some of which 1 claim
have been forfeited."
Troy urged that the Committee in Pub
lic Utilities should take iir> the matter of
a municipal street-car system. an<i caller}
attention to the fact that the franchise of
the Geary-street line was about to run
out. Chairman Reed, of the committee
stated that the question would be consid
ered next Thursday night.
A protest was filed by the Richmond
District Improvement Club against the
board granting permission to the com
pany to erect overhead wires en First
street or any other street, for the reasons
set forth tn the following:
Firstâ The eorrpany has abandoned its road
on Flr*t strett.
Secondâ ThÂ« company Is ret entitled to any
favors from this city, as It has d?Â«trorÂ»d many
cf our most important thcroujrhfares. Or. some
of our streets, where Its tracks are laid, nine
different patches of par' m ?r.t may be seen.
Thlnlâ The smaller corporations have been
forced to place their wire* underjrround and
the Market-street Ccnipany should not be per
mitted to place Its dangerous wires en the
street, and many other reasons which we will
offer at the flrÂ»t opportunity.
Miscellaneous Business.
The City Attorney was directed to sell
under a writ of execution issurd the Wlrt
ber property at Mountain View. Santa
Clara County, and to notify the board of
the time and place of sale. The Assessor
was requested to ascertain the value of
the above mentioned property and to no
tify the beard of the expenses Incurred
by him In obtaining the information that
he may be reimbursed therefor.
The printing committee was authorized
to expend JC02 60 for one set of Insurance
maps for the Assessor, competitive bids
for the same having been received.
An ordinance was passed to print au
thorizing the expenditure of $lf>.W> to con -
struct a culvert of concrete and brick
work and a rock-paved waterway for th<Â»
water of Trocadero gulch, also to grade
Nineteenth avenue, macadamize the road
way and sidewalks and construct 813 lin
eal feet of fence thereon.
A resolution was adopted declaring In
favor of the expediency of constructing
granite curbs and bituminous pavement
on Sixteenth street, between Dolores and
Church, Chelsea place: also of the
laying of stone sidewalks on North Point
street, between Montgomery avenue ami
Hvde streets.
The Mayor was empowered to enter into
a lease with H. H. North. Commissioner
of Immigration, for the rental of the po
lice station at Me!egs wharf.
The Board of Public Works wan author
ized to expend not to exceed SWQQ for v
paving Fourth street from Howard tn
Harrison streets with basalt blocks on
a ?and base.
The Board of Public Works was author
ized to construct a plank roadway on the>
city's portion of Spear- street wharf at an
expense not to exceed WIW.
The same board was authorized to tak^
charge of all public buildings owned by
the city.
An ordinance was passed to print order
ing the grading, repairing and laying of
curbs on the roadwav of Main street be
tween Mission and Howard streets.
The Mayor's veto of the resolution con
tributing the sum of J.Wrt for the Semi
centennial celebration was sustained.
The nrittnancp authorizing the Roard of
Public Works to enter Info a contract for
the erection of a photograph eaÂ»Â»-y In
the Hall of Justice at a cost of S^nn was
referred to Supervisor McCarthy.
permission to maintain its tracks four
vears as they lie on this portion of the
street, but at the end of that period they
must be moved to the center.
Assistant City Engineer Mooser filed a
report that the cost of movlnz the jOO feet
of track would amount to J17.8OO. J. A.
Watt, the attorney for Mrs. Reynolds,
contended that the figure was exaggerated
and not backed by the official statement
of the Board of Public Works.
Electric Lines.
"Every one knows." said Watt, "that
the roadway of the Union-street line is a
flimsy Rffair. being a channel of planks,
and yet according to Mooser's estimate It
would cost J105.C00 per mile to build It."
Watt asked for a, week's time in which
to show that the work would not cost
much more than $2000, but the board
adopted the resolution.
The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company was granted a permit to store
and use crude petroleum for fuel at the
electric llsht station on Jessie street, be
tween Third and Fourth, and also to store
crude petroleum on the vacant lot en
Townsend street, near Second, and at the
station on Townsend street, between Sec
ond and Third. Permission was giver, to
the Bowers Rubber Company to store and
burn crude oil in Its factory at 31 Com
mercial street; also to the Wunder Brew-
Ing Company to use oil fuel under its
boilers In the brewery plant on Lombard
street. Certain conditions imposed by the
Fir? Marshal are to be adhered to In or
der to insure safety, and the tanks are to
be erected with the approval and under
ths supervision of the Board of Public
Works, the privileges to continue during
the pleasure of the Board of Supervisors.
An ordinance was passed to print grant-
Ing the firm of Gray Brothers permission
to" explode blasts at Clipper and Douglass
streets. When the ordinance granting the
same firm the right to operate an engine
in "conjunction with its rock crusher was
taken up several property owners In the
vicinity addressed the board in opposition.
It was finally decided to postpone consid
eration until the decision of Judge Sea
well is rendered in, a suit affecting the
rock- crusher.
The Market Street Railway Company
was granted permission to operate by
means of electricity, with modern appli
ances and requirements, its street railroad
runnlnsr nn Fifth street from Market
street to Eluxome street, and thence to
Fourth street, the work to be done under
the supervision of the Board of Public
Works. Permission was given to the
company to use electricity as a motive
power "on First street to connect with
Battery.
On McCarthy's motion the resolution on
the subject was passr-d to print only after
the insertion of a provision tnat the -city
reserves to itself the ri^ht to order at any
time the removal of the overhead wires.
Braunhart desired the reference of the
resolution to the Board of Public Works
to determine if the laying of underground
wires on the streets named was practi
cable. Curtis said that it would be neces
sary to chanee the whole connecting sys
tem for the few blocks on which the com
pany asks permission to erect overhead
wires, and this would be a manifest injus
tice. With the distinct understanding that
the wires may remain overhead only dur
ing the pleasure of the board, the resolu
tion prevailed.
E. P. E. Troy addressed the board and
said that some" action should be taken to
compel the company to lay proper rails
on the streets.
"The rails which the company has laid
on Mission and Berry streets are miser
able affair?." said Troy, "and amount to
a practical confiscation of the streets.

The mystery In Loretta Sturm's disap
pearance remains unsolved, despite the
efforts of the police departments of two
cities and a host of family friends to find
some trace of the pretty 14-year-old girl
who has so completely vanished from
view. The parents are baffled and have
given up hope of trying to explain the
cause for the girl's flight from home.
Search has been made in every possible
way that could be suggested. To-day's
results were as futile and unyielding of
clew as the other days that have passed
since young Miss Sturm left the family
residence on Isabella street. â¢
Much of the fathers time has been
spent In trying to trace a valuable seal
skin cloak which his daughter carried oft
with her when she disappeared. The
folks think she pawned it to obtain
money. They think that it might be pos-
Blble for her to be found if the where
abouts of the garment Is made known.
But the detectives have not located It as
yet.
The father and mother insist that the
girl had a good home and no cause for
leaving It. They are loth to believe that
she has met any serious accident, al
though there were rumors about the
neighborhood of her home that Loretta
had been despondent for a ttme before she
disappeared. To a friend she remarked
that she was greatly disturbed and dis
gusted, and thought she would go out and
jump overboard.
The remark attracted no especial atten
tion at the time of utterance because it
was apparently only a. foolish outburst of
a child. It seemed to have more signifi
cance after she had lisappeared. But the
fact that she took the ?ack is considered
again3t the possible supposition of sui
cide.
The parents hope their daughter may
have run away because of some fancied
wrong and will return as soon as she re
covers her senses. But the grieving:
mother Is sorely distracted and is break-
Ing down under the strain. -

Colonel E. A. Denicke is about to make
a trip to the Orient, accompanied by Mrs.
Denicke. He goes on a novel mission. His
purpose i3 to create a market in oriental
countries for California asphalt. This ma
terial is used for making roads and floors,
coating piles and many other purposes.
There is no native asphalt iu any consider
able quantity in the lands to which Colonel
Denicke is going. Neither is there any
supply from Europe or any part of the
United States that can compete with the
output of California. "A company has
been organized . to exploit the - asphalt
among the Chinese, Japanese and other
peoples to be visited. Henry Bruner and
Charles Martin of this city, A. Tognazzini
of San Luis Oblspo and Colonel Denicke
are principally concerned in a financial
Vf&y. {
Colonel Denicke says that if the oriental
peoples take kindly to California asphalt
great benefit will accrue to this State.
The company that he goes abroad to rep
resent has a mine in Santa Barbara Coun
ty that has been estimated to contain at
least one and a quarter 'millions of tons
of asphalt. This Is very valuable and will
bring in many millions if it can all be
sold.
The only deposits of asphalt in the
United States of any considerable size,
outside of California, are found in Ken
tucky, and these are not able to offer any
real competition to California. The sig
niiicance of this is that if it is possible
to find the expected market in the East
ern hemisphere, It will always belong to
this State and be a source of continued
and large income for many years. Pro
fessor L.awson. viewing the asphalt de
posits of Santa Barbara County, saM that
thev were the only ones that he had ever
seen where the asphalt was in regular
strata. Colonel Denicke may be absent
several months. He will depart about the
middle of October and will remain abroad
long enough to thoroughly canvass the
field In the Orient.

The great estate of Membland Hall in
England, the seat of the late Lord Revel
stoke, has changed --hands again and the
lands, which formerly belonged to a
banker peer, are now in the hands of Wil
liam Cresswell Gray, the great ship
builder, who has laid, out a large sum of
money on the property. It is a magnificent
estate, which cost Lord Revelstoke more
than $1,250,000. It has. been visited by
royalty many times, and its marine drivo
of some-nine miles In length is of great
beauty.â Detroit Free Press.
" One of England's Landmarks.
One day during Grant's Presidency he
came into the room where his Cabinet was
assembling, quietly laughing to himself. "I
have just read," said he, "one of the best
anecdotes I' have ever met. It was that
John Adams, after he had been President,
was one day taking a party out to dinner
at his home in Quincy, when one of his
guests noticed a portrait over the door and
Bald, 'You have a fine portrait of Wash
ington there, Mr. Adams.' 'Yes,' was the
reply, -'and that old wooden head made
his fortune by keeping his mouth shut '
and Grant laughed again with uncom
mon enjoyment. The apocryphal story
gained a permanent interest in Grant's
mouth, for though he showed no con
sciousness that It could have any appli
cation to himself, he evidently thought
that 1 keeping the mouth shut was not
enough* of itself to insure fortune, and
at any rate was not displeased at finding
such a . ground of* sympathy with the
Father of his" Country. Grant's telling
the story seemed to me. under the cir
cumstances. Infinitely more amuslngr than
the original.â J.-D. Coxe In Scribner's.
General Grant's Reticence.
A weird story Is told of a man by the
name of Van Bosboom, who Is distin
guished in the Transvaal aa the best shot
in the republic. He i9 now 55 years old
and never, it is claimed, has he missed an
object at ! which he fired. A few months
ago he had a productive gold mine and a
flourishing family, but he lost hia mine re
cently, and 8<Jon after his two sons were
Blaln as they were fighting against the
English. The loss of his mine troubled
him little, but when. he learned that his
stalwart sons were ! no more a great
change came over him. He took hia old
flintlock rifle, which he calls Lobengula,
and with a bag of golden bullets he went
to the front to fight the foes of his coun
try. And it Is said that during the recent
battles when the ambulances removed
each day those who had fallen In battle
the physicians could readily pick out the
officers who had been killed by Van Bos
boom, for, .instead of two ounces of lead
or steel, they had two ounces of gold
either in the heart or In the forehead.
Whether this be truth or fiction I know
not, but I do know that there are multi
tudes of men and women who are shot to
death in these days, not only In South
Africa, but in Kurope and America as
well, by the bullets of gold.â Womiletlc

A MAN who has been representing
. himself as M. Stone, president of
the San Pedro and I XL, Dairy
Company, Folsom.' and Twenty
first streets, was arrested ypster
day afternoon at' the Winchester House,
on Third street, by Detectives Wren and
Dinan and is . being detained in "the
tanks" pending an Investigation as to his
conduct. He said he was Walter Tyndall
and that he came from New York five or
six -\eeks ago. It is not supposed that he
pave his true name. He Is about 40 years
of age, of medium height and has sandy
colored whiskers and mustache.
The prisoner has been inserting the fol
lowing advertisement In:papers:.''Collect
or wanted; sober, steady man; permanent
situation: salary $75 per month; $500 bond
required." When applicants replied they
would receive a note bearing the printed
address of the dairy company and signed
"M. Stone," asking them to call at the
Russ House or other central place.
When the arrested man was searched In

who had apparently answered his adver

Schafer had sent a communication to the
real Stone inclosing a copy of an applica
tion which he had made to the Fidelity
Guarantee Company last v Saturday. The
letter surprised Stone and he sent it to
Captain Sermour, with the remark that
some swindler was evidently at work as
he had not advertised for a collector. Cap
tain Seymour detailed Wren and Dinan on
the case, and they fpund Bluemcke,; who
had gone to the dairy, company's offices to
find out for himself .what chance there
was for him. The man Accused of swind
ling had arranged Â«to- meet Bluemcke at
the Winchester House yesterday after
noon, and the detectives were in waiting
when he called. He was promptly placed
under arrest.

'If the Beard of Education sees no valid
reason for the refusal of the. Board of
Examiners to grant a certificate," said he
"it can overrule the lattcr's decision. Â¦â¢ If a
person comes well recommended and in
dorsed he can be appointed."
President Mark, however, is inclined to
credit the; Board of Education with more
discretionary power, than the Superintend
ent gives to it. ' â¢ - > Â¦â¢â¢-. ?.
The plans, of the Board, of Education
for the new department also excite Web
ster's criticism. â¢. Â» ... . . .. . |
"We should have plants throughout the
city where physical culture . may be
taught," said. he. "It should require at
least ten gymnasiums equipped' with" the
latest apparatus, and nonexbut capable
instructors should be employed. Ten mil
lion dollars would, I think, be a fair out
lay to carry this plan through In a proper
manner.- It is absurd to entrust the phys
ical development of 40.000 .school children
to one man, however capable that man
may be." ,' - - * â¢
"Dr. Magnus has, I understand, been
selected bv the Board of Education to
supervise the new department of physical
culture." said Superintendent Webster,
"but the Board of Examtners have the
deciding. power in questions of this sort,
and If the doctor's credentials are not up
to tha" standard required he will receive
no certificate."- . â¢ -,-..,* :Â¦â¢. ,-\-
Superintendent Webster said yesterday
that so far as he was concerned, while
not in any way reflecting on Dr. Magnus'
ability, but purely from a desire to ad
here to the law in the matter, he would
emphatically oppose the doctor's appoint
ment.
According to Webster, this is the situa
tion. Applicants for positions in the city
schools must be possessed either of a cer
tificate or a diploma from certain of the
colleges whose standlne is held to be
equal to that of the University of Cali
fornia. Jefferson University, from which
Dt. Magnus has a diploma, is not one of
these, nor has the learned doctor a teach
er's certificate, so according to Webster's
views the new professor of physical cul
ture is "up against it." .Â¦-â¢â¢- . ;
A clash between the Board of Educa
tion and the Board of Examiners of the
School Department Is imminent. Dr. Max
Magnus has been selected by the Board
of Education to act as head of the new
department of physical culture, but this
selection must be ratified by the Board of.
Examiners at its meeting to be held to
morrow. From remarks made by Super
intendent Webster it seems improbable
that this action will be taken.
Will Oppose the Ratification
of Mark's Nominee by

ALFRED TOBIN, a prominent attorney of this city, a director and legal
representative of the Hlbernla Savings and Loan Society and a brother
of Supervisor Joseph S. Tobin, died yesterday at noon at his home on
Califcrnfa and Taylor streets. "While he had been In ill health for some
time, his death was unexpected and a most severe shock to his family.
Alfred Tobin was 39 years of age. He was born In San Francisco and received
his academic education at St. Ignatius College. After receiving his degree from
that institution he entered the Hastings College of the Law and graduated with
high honors. .
He associated himself with his brother, Joseph S. Tobin, In the practice of
the law and became one of the attorneys for the Hlbernla Savings and Loan
Society. Later he was elected to the directory of the bank. During his life Al
fred Tobin made many warm friends. His generosity and unaffected good fel
lowship endeared him to those who came In contact with him either through
a personal, social or professional relationship. He had no inclination for a pub
lic life, and although by no means of retiring disposition, was noticeably reserved.
At one time he was considered to be one of the leading athletes on the Pa
clflc Coast. He gave much of his time to outdoor sports and was proficient In
most of them. His patronage of athletics and his encouragement of the sports
In which he delighted will be sincerely missed. A year ago he went abroad, spend
ing much of his time In Italy and Switzerland. "When he returned it was to suf
fer the loss of the excellent health he had always enjoyed. For months he
was In a precarious physical condition, but he was not ill enough to alarm his
family. Four days ago he was attacked by pneumonia and in three days he
was dead. Mr. Tobin never married, but made his home with his mother. The
funeral will take place to-morrow morning from St. Mary's Cathedral.

the estate of a dead man by producing a
bogus heir was exposed. The, entire plot
was revealed and for the llrst time the
public saw in astonishment with what
oaring a gang of legal plrateB preyed upon
the dead. Chretien and his tool confessed
their crimes. Several other charges are
pending against Chretien, and Fred Han
stPd, alias Young Dutchy, Is in the County
awaltln e trial on a felony charge.
The morning setslon of the court was
occupied in the reading of the defendant's
confession made before Judge Troutt and
the argument of counsel for the defense,
W . S. Earnes and George F. Curtis, on a
motion to dismiss. Chretien was being
tried on a charge of forgery alleged to
have been committed by the signing of a
fJ^ed to the realty belonging to the estate
of the late Joseph Sullivan, for which J.
J. Rauer paid $7C0. The proof of the exe
cution of the instrument by Chretien was
positive, but the defense contended that
as no such person as "John Sullivan, the
hofr to the estate of the late Joseph Sul
livan, \vas in existence the crime of
forgery had not been committed, the in
strument beinrr merely fictitious and not
forged in the meaning of the law. Mr
Earnes cited the Eppinger and Elliott
cases, in which the Supreme Court applied
the theory advanced by the defense and
on them based his motion to dismiss.
Judge Dunns took the motion under ad
visement during the noon hour, and on
the opening of the afternoon session made
an orcer formally denying the same. Mr.
names took an exception to the ruling
of the court and announced that he rested
his case. Argument was waived, as were

There is a fine small water color by R.
B. Nesbit to be seen in another gallery this
week, a sketch In Perthshire, Scotland. A
threatening sky, foreboding < an imminent
shower, lowers heavily over the land
scape, thin shafts of winter sunlight
pierce the clouds, and below some cattle
stray over the shadowed, heathery moor.
It is full of feeling, a beautiful, eminently
simple composition, and of strong, mas
terly handling. Mr. Nesbit has just re
ceived the highest honor in the gift of the
, Royal Viennese Gallery, their gold medal,
N for his Scotch water color shown at the
last exhibition. He is president of the
Royal Scottish Institute of Water Color,
nnd it Is probable that some of his more
importnnt work may be seen here shortly.
One "Donne"tâ he is further nameless â
has a vory singular and interesting Swiss
water color on exhibition near the N'es
bit." curiously reminiscentâ because of the
difference in mediumsâ of one of the
Frank Short mezzotints. "A Swiss Pass."
Mr. Donne la an Englishman, presumably
of the older school, and has chnson to
prison ths rnsy peaks and glacler-bltten
rides of tho "Jungfrau" In a small frame
ful of paper . perhaps 8x12 inches. It is
strange, too, that one perfectly gets the
effect of vastness, distance, Illimitable
depths and heights, sensibly aided there
to by the suggestion of two or three tiny
chalets nested in the mountain side, and
the picture is a worthy attempt to realize
the vivid, brilliant yet illusive, Iridescent
glory and shern of color that crowns this
most beautiful of all the Swiss mountains.
Joseph T>. Greenbaum exhibits this
week, in a local gallery, a modest collec
tion of Monterey sketches, a few French
subjects and some local work of Interest.
The pictures will be on exhibition for the
rest of the week and are to be disposed
of by private sale. Mr. Greenbaum will
shortly return to Paris for study and work
and his native city will know him no more
for at least four or five years. The Mon
terey, sketches are perhaps the most
worthy in the collection, two of them, of
shore, sea, boats, and a picturesque mass
ing of fishermen's huts, being decidedly
pleasing.
The Sketch Club has taken up the sub
ject of Japanese art for its six months'
winter course of study, and It is under
stood that an exhibition of famous prints
by Hiroshige, Shunsen, Haronobu, Ota
maru, Toyokunl and others will later be
in order.
It Is understood that a movement is on
foot among the school teachers of Oak
land for the purchase of one of the late
artist's pictures, with a view of placing
It in the new public library, which will
shortly be erected in Oakland.
A very interesting exhibition Is promised
by the Sketch Club, as its lirst public ef
fort under the presidency of Miss Anna
Frances Brlggs, for next Friday and Sat
urday, all day and evening, and Sunday
afternoon. A choice collection of Japanese
curios, all of religious origin, and consist
ing mostly of temple embroideries and
bronzes, has been gathered from va
rious sources, and will be placed on ex
hibition, beginning Thursday evening
with a reception to members. A short pen
sketch of each exhibit has been prepaied,
giving its history, and a list of authori
ties. A large amount of useful informa
tion in concise form is thus placed at the
disposal of those interested in Japanese
art. Included in the exhibition is
the finest bronze Buddha in California,
some magnificent ecclesiastical embroider
ies and many specimens of the stmpler
Shinto symbols. An admission fee of
twenty-five cents will be charged to cover
the Incidental expenses of the affair.
The Yelland exhibition at the Hopkins
Art Institute has attracted a large atten
tion since the opening last week, and has
met with a modest financial success. None
of the larger pictures have, as yet, been
