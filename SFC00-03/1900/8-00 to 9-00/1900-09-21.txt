CHINESE BY THE RUSSIANS
â¢â¢ LONDON. Sept. 21.â "Authentic accounts have been received here," says the Moscow correspondent of the Standard.
** "of a horrible massacre at Blagovestlchensk; which was undoubtedly carried out under direct orders from the Rifssian
j! authorities, and which then let loose the tide of slaughter through Amur.
â¢j* "The entire Chinese population, of 5000 souls was escorted out of town to a spot five miles up the Amur, and then.
â¢â¢ being led In batches of a few hundred to the river bank, were: ordered to crosa over to the Chinese side. 'No boats were
T provided, and the river is a mile wide. The Chinese were flung alive into the stream and were stabbed or shot at the
X least resistance.- while Russian volunteers, who lined the'bank. clubbed' or shot'any who attempted to land. Not one es
i. caped alive. The river bank for miles was strewn with corpse3."

TWO REPORTS FROM CHAFFEE.
One Tells of Murders by Boxers, and
Strike Officials Very Busy in the Vi
cinity of Hazleton.
HAZLETON, Pa., Sept. 20.â There was
little activity to-day around the United
Mine Workers' headquarters whence the
coal miners' strike is being directed.
Most of the union officials spent the day
In the outlying towns, meeting the strik
ing men and giving them instructions.
ICo overtures have been advanced by
either side, and there is at present no In
dication that any will be put forth soon.
The strike officials are still at work get
ting the men out, and they say they will
not cease their activity In that respect
until every operator In the anthracite re
gion is tied up. The operators, though
badly crippled, are to-day as confident of
success as they have heretofore been.
The production of coal In the Hazleton
workers with a view to arbitration.
"General Manager Frank Pardee of A.
Pardee & Company's mines, the Cran
berry and Crystal RiOge collieries, says
the property is to-day producing about
three-fourths of the average output. Mr.
Pardee said:
"The men are staying away from work
because they have been intimidated. If
this were not so, I believe fr) per cent of
our men Â¦would be working. We are pro
tecting all men working on our property.
Our firm has nothing to arbitrate. Our
men presented but one grievance, the
powder question. Our answer was that
if we reduced the price of powder we
would have to readjust the wage scale.
They said they did not want this done,
but some of them struck. As far as I
know, there is no understanding among
the operators regarding- any action that
might be taken with a view to breaking
the strike. Each operator Is fighting
his own battle."
WILKESBARRE. Sept. 20.â The strik
ers succeeded to-day In Inducing about
fifty men employed at the West End Coal
Company's colliery in Mccanaqua. the
enly mine at work in the upper region.
to quit work. This is the first break in
the working force of the mine since the
strike began.
SHAMOKIN, Pa., Sept. 20.â One hun
dred more men at the Locust â¢ Gap col
liery, operated by the Philadelphia and
Reading Coal and Iron Company, joined
the ranks of the strikers to-day. The
company claims that enough men arc
working to enable operations to continue.
The Xorth Franklin, at Trevorton. owned
by the same company, continues working
full handed and It Is likely that the
United Mine-workers will not be able to
induce any of the men to strike. Most
of the men at Trevorton own homes
there and are said to fear the company
will abandon the operation if they strike.
The colliery Is the only industry in the
place.
While Hugh Davis, a fire boss at the
Pennsylvania colliery, was on his way
to work to-day, Hungarian strikers
assaulted him with clubs. He was seri
ously Injured. An additional number of
detectives went to the colliery after the
assault to afford better protection to
men desiring to work.
NO OVEETITKES ADVANCED.

region is growing smaller with each suc
ceeding day. One of the best proofs of
this is the report of the superintendent of
the Hazleton division of the Lehigh Val
ley Railroad, which handles the coal from
all but six collieries in the region. This
report shows that the shipments have
fallen off to less than two-thirds of the
; normal quantity during the past four
days.
PLANNING TO EMPLOY FORCE
Superintendents Will Make a Show
of Strength.
scranton, Pa., Sept. 20â The super
intendents of the Lackawanna, Delaware
and Hudson and Pennsylvania companies
and many of the individual operators held
a conference to-day for the final" consid
eration of plans to force the working of
some cf the mines at least. It Is an
nounced that the superintendents are now
ready to make a determined show of
strength against the- strikers. They In
tend to centralize men at certain collieries
and operate them under the protection of
the law if necessary. They have had hun
dreds of men made deputy sheriffs and
watchmen. Their confidential runners
have canvassed many of the miners and
laborers at their homes, and the opinion
is that an entering wedge Is almost ready
to be driven in the stronghold of the
strike, District No. 1, where there is to
day no change from the conditions of yes
terday.
The district executive board met at the
strikers' headquarters this afternoon to
deal with the effort of the big companies
to make a working stand, all the features
of which they -are informed of, and they
say they will be prepared to offset It.
There will also come before the board the
troublesome washery question. The Ox
ford, Bellevue and Diamond washeries
went to work this morning, as well as
three smaller ones.. The Lackawanna
Company has been successful in working
many of its foremen at the three places
named, the regular working force being
practically on strike. Two cf the minor
washeries, the Columbus and the An
thony, have made overtures for settle
ment, while the Gibbons drift is also said
to be ready to settle. These matters are
likely to be fully determined this after
noon, but the settlement will only be on
the advanced wages demanded for the
laborers, the strike leaders say.
One of the culm banks, the Bellevue,
was the scene of a tragic death to-day.
Father Logue commended the attiturf'?

of a clash between the strikers and lion

ALTHOUGH THE LAW EXPRESSLY FORBIDS EMPLOYMENT OF WO
MEN IN THE COAL MINES. THERE ARE NUMBERS OF THEM WHO
LABOR IN THE WORKINGS. AS THE ABOVE PICTURE SHOWS.
HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 20.â The at

organize branches of the United Mine
workers at Tower City and Williamstown
has been a failure and the indications are
that the miners at' these daces will not

President Mitchell -telegraphs that the
outlook ' is very encouraging. Many re
cruits are being made- In the Lehlgh re
gion, and he Is proud of the unanimity
existing among the miners of the Wyom
ing region. He says if the same unity ex
isted in the other distrfcts of the anthra
cite region the operators would be face to
face with the crisis at once.
WILKKbtSARRE. Pa., Sept. 20.â The

very likely the movement the operators
are said to be considering as a means o*
striking back at the strikers Is the ex
panding of the Lackawanna Miners'
Union, an independent organization of
Delaware. Lackawanna and Western
miners, and the using of this body as a
lever to crystallize the anti-strike senti
ment- which the operators lirmly believe
obtains with a majority of the men In the
Lackawanna region. By the middle of
next week the operators figure the eondi
tionsln the lower district will be such as
to discourage the men in this section from
continuing on strike and they will be look
ing for some means to let go. By having
the Lackawanna Union in working order
the operators think tne anti-strike ele

when this element gets* together and see3

During last night there was a slight
falling off in the codl shipments through
this city.,. but ,the. jjfflclal?---afre believe
that they can be kept up to the normal
quantity now that the mines working have
gone on full- time instead of three-quarter
time.
READING. Pa., Sept. M.â The aid of the
labor unions of the Schuylkill Vallev is
now being solicited to fight the Reading
Railroad in the effort to close the mines
in that territory. In this city some of the
unions, which have a membership of 4jOO,
have passed resolutions of boycott, and
the Pottsville and Harrisburg- unions are
sending word here of similar action.
National Organizer Dilcher. and other
workers from this region will go to the
Hazleton section on' Sunday In an en
deavor to complete the tie-up there and in
the Schuylkill district.
Frank Mangan was there gathering coal
along with a crowd of others, guddenly
some one shouted "The watchmen 'are
coming" and there was a hurry to get
away. The man was feeble from sickness
and in the excitement of the moment he
fell and died on the edge of the dump.
Heart failure was the cause.'

WASHINGTON, Sept. 2O.-The status of

follows: There are now before the De

awaiting answers. These Include the Ger
man note concerning the surrender of
Chinese ringleaders; the original Russian

from Peking 1 , which has not yet been act

STATUS OF THE SITUATION.
SUSPICIOUS AS TO SUSSIA.
Desire Said to Be Only to Induce
Other Powers to Withdraw.
LONDON, Sep. 21. 4 a. m.â Such Peking
dispatches as appear this morning tena
to confirm the suspicions regarding the
attitude of Russia already expressed by
Dr. Morrison, the correspondent of thc-
Times at the Chinese capital. The Dally
News prints a telegram almost identical
with the advices to the Daily Express
from Peking-, but adding: that in the opin
ion of the correspondent the Russian.-*
only desire to induce the other powers to
withdraw.
The Morning Post's Peking representa
tive, wiring September 13. expresses th^
same opinion. He declares that M. do
Giers will not go unless the other Min
isters also go. The Russian legation, he
asserts, had prepared to go. TSut reversed
its intention pending further instructions.
This delay he thinks due In all probability
to the non-departure of the other lega
tions.
"General Chaffee." continues this cor
respondent, "has directed a distribution
of rice to the poor. This plan is a good
one. but its application is somewhat pre
mature. What is chiefly needed is surety
of trade so that necessities may be se
cured. â¢
"The American commander has ex
pressed his disapproval of further ex
peditions against the Boxers. The Inde
cision exhibited in this respect is shame
ful. No settlement Is possible until th<Â«
Boxers and their accomplices are van
quished. -Numerous, schemes are on foot
for catching the Boxer leaders, but the
task is very difficult, as they always keep
out of the way."
Dr. Morrison, wiring to the Times under
date of September 17, confirms the report
that M. de Giers has indefinitely post
poned his departure and announces that
a column of Americans started that day
to rescue Christians at Shu'nihslen, twen
ty-five miles northeast of Peking. He re
ports also that the British Hongkong regi
ment has left the capital and that the
Japanese have occupied Huangtsun. the
railway station next to Fengtal, where
they will immediately begin the recon
struction of the line in conjunction with
the British.
The news that Sir Claude Macdonald's
removal from Peking to Toklo was ar
ranged last April is commented upon by
some London papers as indicating that
the home authorities were dissatisfied
with his conduct of affairs.
BERLIN. Sept. CO.-The Politisch*
Correspondenz declares that Ger
many has demanded the extra
dition of the Empress Dowager
from China. The Tageblatt de
nies this. I learn that the truth is half
way between the two reports. Germany
deslres the accord of all the powers l.i
regard to those responsible for the out
rages and will then demand their delivery,
even if the Empress Dowager should be
among them. If the accord of all the
powers cannot be pained I learn that Ger
many will Insist upon her idea alone, or
with those powers who do consent.
It is rumored on trustworthy authority
in Shanghai, says a dispatch to the Lokal
Anzelger. that Germany will insist upon
the destruction of the Chinese coast de
fenses and the Yangtse forts as a con
dition of her entrance upon peace nego
tiations.
LONDON. Sept. 20.â The Peking corre
spondent of the Daily Express, wiring
September 12, asserts that the Russian
troops are' " not leaving.- British heasl
quarters. he adds, had been informed that
the Russians had left, but the statement
was untrue, the fact being that the Rus
sians have been reinforced and made a
claim for more extended quarters in
Peking.
HAZLETON*. Pa., Sept. 20.â Reports re
ceived at ctrflce headquarters this rnorn
ir.g contained good news to the idle an
thracite coal miners. Kirst came informa
tion of a break amorg the employes in the
L&ttimer mine, which was considered
en invulnerable spot. The number of men
who q-jit was Quite small, but the union
rr.en are satisfied 'that they will make
further inroads en the force there. The
<l\>!eraln colliery was shut down tight.
The Evans collier}- at Deaver Meadow
k also failed to start work. Both the Cole
rain and the Evans are operated by the
A- S. Van Wyckle Company.
A committee of the miners employed
at the Colerain mires called upon Super
intendent Myers this morning iind pre
sented the followir.gr demand'
"We the undersigned committee of Cole
rain do hereby ask for two weeks' pay
&nd 10 per cent incrt-ase on the dollar. 15
per cent on" on the keg: of powder and that
all men be raid for overtime work "
Superintendent Myers received the men
pleasantly ar.d told them they would re
ceive an answer in three day3.
A few more men went to work In the
Markel mines at Jeddo and Oakdale to
day than worked yesterday. The strikers
claim i he reason for this was that a re
port had sot into circulation that the men
who lived In the company houses and
tfwelt In the company stores would not
receive the pay that was due them If they
did not go to work. This, however, was
denied by both the son-union men and the
company.
Tcere was considerable excitement this
iaomir.gr at No. 40 shaft of the Lehlgh
Valley Coal Company, east of this city.
The ccal ar.d iron policemen had gene to
the houses in that locality and induced a
number cf breaker boys to go to, work. It
was charged. Strikers attempted to per
puade the boys to stay out, but retired
they insisted on working. On the
wy to the shaft half a dozen foreign
women surrouneJfd the policemen, and
tttJcir.s the dinner pails frcm the fright
Â«-r.Â»-o Loys threatened to strike the coal
and iron policemen. A mob of 300 persons
soon gathered and it looked as if the po
licemen would get the worst of it, but
they managed to escape the crowd with
out precipitating a fight. A few of the
boys went to the mines with the police
men, but most of them returned to their
homes.
The march to Colerain, which was ar
ranged for last night by the McAdoo men,
did not take place this morning, a tip hav-
Ir.g been received that Colerain would not
start to-day. The march of the strikers
from Freeland to Sandy, Run and Pond
Creek was "also abandoned. The union
men after a conference this morning: de
cided to organize the men at those places
and then ask them to quit. The mines at
Eckley and Sandy Run are Jn fuJl opera
tion this niornin? as usual, and the Mar
kle mine at Highland is operating with
about the came force as yesterday.
President Mitchell of the United Mine
workers returned to-day from Mahoney
Â¦ C!ty, where he addressed a meeting last
Mr.ight. He said that large pains had

PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 20.â"Every
thing c.uiet ar.d orderly" is the report that
rcrr.es from the strike region. A few more
mir.ewcrkers joln^u the strikers' ranks to-
Cay, but not many.
The temper of the mine owners on the
Question of arbitration as Indicated In in
terviews to-day is very much ag-air.st the
proposition. Nevertheless Father Phillips
cam* h<re from the Hazleton region to
r.ight ar.d !s with Archbishop Ryan in
consultation on the question very near
and dear to his heartâ the quick settle
ment of the strike by arbitration or any
ether honorable meji~3. Protestant clergy
men In Hazleton have also taken up the
matter ar.d â¢will endeavor to bring about
a pettlement.
The coal scarcity Is more keenly felt to
day, ar.d although the Reading Company
is rrAr.ir.g and shipping its usual Quota of
anthracite dealers are finding It bard to
get as much as they need. The tonnage
< t the other great coal carrying compa
nies is gradually diminishing 1 , however.
In the natural order of things unless
the strike Is settled will soon cease alto
pt-ther from some districts.
Somewhat vag-ue reports are coming in
r.f preparation on the part of the Sheriffs
and coal compares for a possible clash
with the reckless element among the
striker*. N'early everybody believes that
trouble must corne. y*-t there has been no
sign of an outbreak and the men appear
to be well handled by their leaders.

mark In Jxmdon on January 23, where he
paw Howard. on the streets.
Parker explained that the reason ha
had tald this was that Howard was then
at London to appear for trial for the mur
der of George Bauer and his plea was to
be Insanity.
The defense is resting its case on the
alibi claimed for Howard and Is not pav
ing any attention to . the claim of thÂ»
prosecution that the Phot came from tho

THE HOBSON INTERVIEW
Assumes a Patronizing Air and Says
He Believes the "Young Man
Meant Nothing Unkind."
NEW YORK. Ropt. 2u.â Admiral Dewoy.
t ho Is Ftoppinp at Sayvillc. I>. I., talked
to-<iav of the Hobpon Interview, saying:
"I hardly think the young man meant to
pay anything unkind, and perhaps he did
not say what is said thf>re. The three
VMWto ho referred to are the Isl.-i. de
Cuba, Isla >1<* Luzon and Don Juan de
Austria. .They wrre the least injured of
the ten or twelve ship* sunk at Manila.
>Caval Constructor Oapps, a very able
man, was with me and he and diver? and
i-ipcrts from Honpkonpr made an exami
nation of all th<* Spanish phips and de
rided that the?e thr^e were worth sav
j nc â three out of a dozen. They wore
laisf-d and temporary repairs were made
nt Â«_"avite. The vessels proceeded under
ihrir own Ftoam to Hongkong and had
been there for some time, undergoing re
pairs, before Hobson paw them.
â¢â¢As a master of fact I never claimed
ihat xve sunk the ships. I reported that
we destroyed them. I did see with my
own eyes an eljrht-Inch shell strike the
si cm *of the Reina Christina. Admiral
>!ontejo's flagship, and that destroyed
' â¢'The statement that the vessels were not
much injured below the water line was
i.mbably true. Every one knows that it
is Impossible for shells to do much exe
cution below the water line, or anything
but torpedoes to do much damage there.
A few inches of water is a great protec
tion. Armored ships are not armored
much below the water line, the water be
i:;g protection enough from a shell.
"I hardly think it worth our while to
pay much attention to this. You know it
is "human nature to deprecate what oth
ers have done, and Mr. Hobson may not
Jiave been quoted correctly or in full."

OGDKN'. Utah, Sept. 20.â Governor

speeches to-day to five, Inchidinp the night
meeting at this place. The special train
left Pocatello at fi o'clock-- this morninR
nnd arrived at Ogden at 6 o'clock in the
evening, where a Ptop was made for the
night. .
At JyOf?an the first stop of the day was
made, and there-, the meeting- was held In
the Mormon Tabernacle, a mile from the
station. Mrs. J. Ellen Foster made the
opening address. Introducing Governor
Roosevelt. The local hand played "Amer
ica" and Mr?. Foster called the attention
of the. auoience to the fact that this was
also the national air of England, "God
Save the Queen," and it was significant,
ns< it miRht he inferred that England and
thÂ« United States with one national an
them and one destiny v.ould one day dom
inate the world. Many women were -in
the, tabernacle, and as they are voters
here to them Mrs. Foster made a special
appeal. She faid in part:
I am hÂ»re on thin fcreat occasion only for a
moment and I speak to you because I ani sent
hÂ» r 4 by the RepublW-an National Committee
to do what I can to Induce the, voters of Utah
and those of you in this State who are, women
as well as men to stand, in this next election,
for the doctrines which arÂ«Â» taught by the Re
publican party and which have been incor
porated into the legislation of that party ne
cf,u?e the legislation of tha t party has been
rnnstrvctlvo legislation which has made the
country what It is to-day. I am not here to
sr^ak to you of doctrines and principles, I am
only here to congratulate, you upon the pleas
ure in store for you this morning.
The tabernacle was. well filled and Gov
ernor Roosevelt spoke in part as follows:
I am more Blad than I can well express to
havÂ« an opportunity of speaking to you. tho
men and women or the sons and daughters of
tho men and women who stretched out into
this land and conquered the wilderness for the
nation. 1 come to speak to you on party is
f>ueÂ« a~d upon issues that are far more than
party. I appeal not merely to Republicans, but
I appeal to every man and woman proud of the
country's past and confident of the country s
future" and who is resolved to attain that fu
ture and to stand by- the country now. I
would dialling" th* right, of any of .you nÂ«rÂ«
to be a better Westerner than I am. It has
nrver Wen my fortune before to pet into your
wonderful State, but Idaho, Montana and the
Dakotas I knew well for years. I have worked
with the people: I saw them close up. I knew
what thoy could do. what th*-y were capable of.
8nd because I know the \\ est I feel that I
know this country. I feel that I know tho
Amerkan people. I feel sure that when our
Pf ople have once started to do a piece of work
that they will s-e it through without fail. This
morning! through my good fortune. I havo
been able to drive about your beautiful town
and to travel through your wonderful arid
b.autiful valley. More and more, as I look at
it as I- see what you and your forefathers have
done more and more has it made me feel
proud as an American. tk> think what you. my
fellow- Americans, have done. More and more
I feel confident as to what we can yet do. We
are not a. worn out race, content to rest on
tho memory of what has been done- by thos<Â»
who have gone before us. We are not a. people
who have to take refuge in pride of ancestry,
and admit that we of this day are not able
to do deeds ourselves. On the contrary, while
wÂ«- take tho greatest pride in the deeds of the
men who went before us. I feel that the very
fact that those, deeds were done must spur us
on to do deeds also.
It i* a great thing to have material preat-
Tiess- it is a great thing to be able to point
to the hardships, sacrifices and brutality nec
essary to develop the resources of a great
country hut there is something that lies back
of and eyen above material development. It
is a greater thing to have the men and women
themselves. I admire the way you have come
into the wilderness and have made it blossom
like the rose. I admire what you have done,
here In building up the countryâ thÂ« farms,
ranches and the cities you have built. I like
to look at your crops and to look at the output
of '-our mines and everything c-lse that you
have here, but what I think you have thÂ»;
most cause to be proud of are your children.
I hell we with all my soul in the old doctrine
that blessed are they who build for the future;
who bring up citizens to rule the land; citizens
to si-read our name and our blood and our
principles throughout the .world's universal
srace. to make the name of America supreme
in this continent as the elder among you did.
and who now go forth In the face of the world
to make our country in the century that Is to
come stand toward the Old Â¦ World aÂ« it has
stood toward this continent. In the century
that is closlrz.
Each generation has its allotted taak ami
as we do that task so do we or do we not
leave a heritage of ihonor to those who comÂ»
after us. Now. why are we here to-day?
Why am I able to speak to* you? Because
your fathers were not- timid weaklings:-be
cause the men and women of the middle 1 of
the nineteenth century came out Into this
Western country, driving their white-topped
prairie schooners with the Flow ox teams or
mules or horses, the men walkins beside th?
wagon. Bftt you have all seen the women and
the smaller children in the wagon and the
larger tow-headed lot walking alongside -and
the big boys driving the cattle. But you know
it all. .You came out, here, with your; cattle
and household goods .to make homes and build
up - great commonwealths. . In the .words of
I^owell.' to -pitch -new-Btates -a.s- the -old- w-briJ
men pitched tents. Now how did you' do It?
Did you do It by seeking to-bave 'an easy
time, by making", up. your. minds. If. you- oam.'v
to. any Â¦difficulties you* would Â« shirk 'them â¢an*
the standpoint of a business man I am going
to Bound the note of alarm and warn you all
that this is your campaign.
The Congress of the United States passed a
currency bill and it was the intention on the
part of members of both houses of Congress
that they ehould settle this question. But the
Drnocratlc-Populistic-Soclalistle. party has
taken an appeal and they are poln* to have a
new trial. They have retained some other
lawyers in the cause. From this rostrum I
heard one of the most eloquent speechps In 1SJ6
delivered by Carl Schurz. They have got him.
They have got Bourke Cockran. They have
pot a few others that were with us in 1*96 to
plead their cause before the people under the
flimsy Rulse of imperialism. What has that
got to dÂ« with finance? Now, my friends, look
ing into the faces of the people that I see be
fore mo. I feel more confident than ever that
they have got <o learn some other excuse to
Ket away from the issue which the people have
settled in their own minds for themselves.
ThÂ»rÂ« is not much in this question that ap
peals to the patriotism of the American people.
The wnr with Spain was not brought on en
tirely by the Republican party. The people ot
the United States rose in their Indignation at
the horrors committed in Cuba, and by the.
sheer force of their will, through their Repre
sentatives in Congress and the executive of
the nation, they demanded that those atrocities
should cease. There was no division of senti
ment when that question came before the peo
ple for settlement. . As a consequence of that
war the archipelago of the Philippines came
into our lianda. You know who raised the flag
there, nnd you will know who pulb it down, if
anybody dares.

We have neve* ! had a movement for ex

their country. I have Just passed through
Idaho, of which as great a' man as D'anlel
Webster said that the land was only fit for
cactus and jackrabhits. We see what it is to

it was not nearly as badly off as it expected
to he. Six or seven years ago Hawaii under
President Harrison wished to bÂ» annexed to the
American nation and the American flag was
hoisted. Then came in President Cleveland,
with a Democratic administration, and. to use
their own language, they hauled down the flag.
AVe have hoisted it again since, gentlemen, and
for keeps this time. The Democrats in justi
fying in Congress the action of the President
used precisely the arguments they have used
against our keeping the Philippines at the
present moment. In the first place they ob
jected because, being a republic, we were not
fitted to do the work that other great nations
dp; that we are not fitted to do what empires
and kingdoms can do; that wo could not.ven
'ture outside- the limits of the continent. In
the next place to bring in the islands would be
in bring In an oligarchy. . .
At Brlgham : City an open air meeting

a mile from the station. Speeches were
made by John Henry Smith and Governor
Roosevelt. In concluding his remarks
here Governor Roosevelt said:
I ask you to support the man whom we have
nominated because the promises we have made
have squared with our performances: because
the prophecies oÂ£ evil to which our opponems
have given utterance have been absolutely fal
sified by the events; because you desire the
maintaining of the material conditions which
ba\*e so well secured our well-being In the
paxt four years, and above and beyond all for
the sake of the destiny of the greatest republic
upon which the sun has ever shown; for the
sake of proving at the beginning of a new cen
tury that America intends to be what Bhe
boasts Hhe is. the leader arnonp: the peoples of
mankind, and that the nations, of the world
shall know that we take no backward step.

ANOTHER PARAMOUNT ISSUE.
GALVESTOX. Tex., Sept. 20.â This ,
evening Mayor Jones proclaimed that
martial law would cease at noon to-mor
row and the civil authorities would as
sume direction of municipal affairs. This
was done at the suggestion of General
Scurry, who expressed the belief that con
ditions had reached such a stage that the
civil authorities were able to cope with
the situation. This, however, does not
mean the immediate withdrawal of the
military. They are to co-operate with the
city officials in the enforcement of order
and will continue on duty as a part of the
government. Since martial law has pre
, vailed In Galveston good order has re- !
suited. It was feared in some quarters
, that when it became known that the mili
tia had given way to civil authoritv the
looting and robbery which began after the
storm and continued until the declaration .
of martial law might recommence. The ;
military forces will be used as a check j
on this character of crime, however, and
will in all probability remain here for the
next twenty days. The shooting of ne
groes by military men for looting has
had a most salutary effect and has in a 1
measure terrorized the offenders; still
', there are cases of robbery reported daily,
which are being dealt with severely.
Labor in Galveston Is at a premium.
There Is not an Idle man In the city.
Regardless of station or position, a man
must work. The merchant and his e'erk

man who has known nothing but hard
work since the time of his childhood, it
is a cosmopolitan force now at work on
the city avenues. White men and black
working in gangs under one head Is a
daily scene. It is all done for the good
of Galveston. The health of the living
must be preserved at any cost. The city
must be cleaned and the dead burned that
the survivors may continue to live, u .is
imperative that .the wreckage about the
city be cleared immediately. The stench
arising from the bodies beneath the ruma

TEL. WASHINGTON. Sept. 20.â The dis
Â«;uict!rig feature of the cablegram received
from tJeneral MaoArthur to-day, when
compared with the report of the Taft
commission, lies not so much in the re
port of the engagement at Mavitac in the
province of I.Â»aguna. which comes within
the territory where the commission re
j'.irtcd activity among the insurgents, as
in the indications that Aguir.aldo'a fol

that part of the island which the com
mission reported practically tree from in

with the insurgents, is on the northwest

which almost bisects the island of Luzon,

Not only the officials of the administra
tion, but army officers on duty in Wash
ington who are supposed to be unin
fluenced by partisan politics, express the
opinion that the present activity of the
insurgents i? due to the political agitation
in this country and to the hope that if
they can hold out until ISryan has been

FRESNO, Sept. 20.â The case of Fred
Himes. the boy poisoner of his father.
was given to the jury shortly before noon.
The trial has been without sensational
features. No facts not known wero
brought out. The strong point relied on
in the youth's behalf is that under tha
statute a child under l\ is not to be pre
sumed guilty of a crime, and that upon
the prosecution devolved the onus of
proving that he was aware of the enor
mity of the crime when committed.
Another point was that the testimony
did not conclusively show that death was
not primurily from other causes than tho
poison. Fred maintained his familiar at
titude of calm impassiveness. The de
fense was th?t he was driven by the bru
tality and neglect of his father to com
mit an act. the enormity of -which he
could not realize. There was testlmony
of the boy's excellent character, and h*
one witness put ft: "I wish every mother
had as good a boy as Fred Himes. He
was housemaid and plowboy and both
father and mother to his younger broth
ers." On the other hand, there was testi
mony by several witnesses that the fath
er was a drunkard and a worthless fel
low.
The Jury after deliberating four hours
returned at 3 o'clock a verdict of not
guilty.

The Democrats from Deer Lodge

and devised plans for the formation of a
State party to be called the Independent
Democratic party, which will hold a con
vention in Butte on October 2 to nominate
a. State ticket. The faction will also, the
leaders declare, put a ticket ln every
county.
It is believed that fusion will be effected
to-morrow, probably on the lines of the
offer made to-day, the Democrats having
the entire ticket "except the Governor.
The Populist and Labor parties adopted
platforms to-day, reaffirming previous
declarations by the National Populist
Conventions and Labor conventions. They
Indorsed Bryan, the free coinage of silver
and in particular demand an eight-hour

HELENA. Mont.. Sept. 2O.-The three
State conventions in session here spent
the day maneuvering for a division of the

upon a division that would be recommend

Governorship, the electoral ticket to be
divided, one each, but all the electors to

OGDEN. I'tah, Sept. 20.â Governor II.
M. Wells, when asked for an expression
as to the actions of Acting Governor Neb
ecker, this afternoon said: _
"Quil Is a great joker, and so is Judge
Powers. I suppose the only thing I can
do is to wait my opportunity to get a
good joke on them. If any one takes the
action seriously or pretends that it will
avail Judge Powers anything in the wav
of furnishing him a credential for the
United States Senate he can see further
than I can. If I had made an appoint
ment myself the Senate would not seat
the appointee. That was settled In the
Quay case. You ask me what I will do in
the matter. I suppose when I see the
president of the Senate I will laugh. I
think Quil expects that."
gALT LAKE, Sept. 2O.-Utah Republi-
N ""^ can officials jand politicians ha.d a
scare when they got up this morning to
find that Governor "Wells and Secretary
of State Hammond had left the State ad
ministration in the hands of a Democratic
acting Governor by leaving the State to
meet Governor Roosevelt at Pocatello,
Idaho. Under the statutes Aqullla
Nebeker, president of the State Senate,
is acting Governor. When Mr. Xebeker
discovered late last night that Wells and
Hammond were both out of the State he
appointed Judge O. W. Powers, United
States Senator, to fill the vacancy occa
sioned by the failure to elect a Senator at
the last session of the Legislature. Then
he proceeded to announce changes in the
gubernatorial staff and shake up official
dom generally. Mr. Nebeker is a promi
nent cattleman, with a cowboy's fondness
for a joke, and does not view his own
meteoric career as Governor very serious
ly, but his political opponents were seri
ously alarmed until they learned that his
term would end shortly after noon to-day
with the return of Governor "Wells.

Frank H. Short followed Mr. Shortridge
In a brief speech. He referred to his well
known oposition to the acquisition of the
Â¦Philippines and said he did not agree wth
Mr. Bryan when the latter was trying to
srrurp the ratification of the treaty. He
thought, however, that only a Republican
administration could solve the problem of
with the islands after they had
been acquired.
In dealing with the so-called trust issue
Mr. Shortridge made frequent reference
to the Raisin Association, provoking
l.Tuprhter and applause. He also face
tiously remarked that Mr. Bryan"s opposi
tion to the trusts was not so pronounced

his ardor had been cooled by coming in

Well-Known Orator Discusses Questions of the Campaign
Before a Large Audience and Is Greeted With
The pursuing party will change horses,
equip themsselv< s for a hard licht and
push en the trail Â«>f the robbers. They
v.ill be jcineJ by several other fearless
men, and the- robbers will undoubtedly be
taken e'ead or alive. A di?natch was rent
from Winnemucca last nipht requesting
the authorities at T'.iscarora to organize
a posne to Intercept the runaways at
White Rock, but no answer has been re
ceived from them as yet and it !s not
known if they are co-operating with other
authorities or not. People who knew the
country say iha.t if the robbers are headed
off at that po'nt or turned from their sup
posed route they will undoubtedly run
nuninst one of the other posses worked
toward that center.
That the robbery was well planned Is
evident, as the thieves had, two or three
relays of horses stationed aloi:g their pro
posed route of escape The first change
of horses was.ma.ue about lltteen miles
Irom Winnemucca and the second at the
Sllva ranch, thirty-rtve miles northeast
oÂ£ the scene of tha . robbery. The latter
change was made just one hour betore
the Winnemueca posse arrived there.
The robbers then struck out for Squaw
Valley, their evident intention being to
get into the Junipeis country at the head
of the Owyhee Klver, a wild section,
where they will have no trouble In elud
ing their pursuers. At Hilva"s ranch most
of the Golconda posse turned back, their
horses having given out. Constable Col
well, Dave Abel and two Jndlan trailers
kept on, as did also Deputy Sheriff Kose.
Kaward Ducker and Ernest l>uvivler, the
three latter being the remnant of the
posse which left Winnemucca.
This morning Abel returnee to Golconda
and reported that Colwell and the Indians
were hot on the trail ot the robbers when
ho left them. This ls the only news of the
pursuit received this morning. It is gen
erally believed here that the robbers will
escape, but the men who arÂ«s after them
are not of the giving-up kind, and news
of a tight may be received at any time.
A dispatch received here from Tusca
rora at 4::!0, a town nearly a hundred mifea
from Winnemucca, reports the arrival
there of three of the pursuing posse. They
state that they have reliable Information
that the outlaws are about twelve miles
out of Tuscarora and are headed for
White Rock, a village about fifty miles
northeast and within sixty miles of the
Oregon line. Their horses are now worn
out and nearly dead from the hard run.

Jury Decides He Was Not Responsi
ble for Dempsey's Death.
Special Kitratch to The Call.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Sept. 20.â J. W.
Maze to-day was by a unanimous v.ote of
the jury acquitted of the charge of the
murder of W. H. Dempsey of Paso Rubles
at the Mint saloon there. The origin of
the crime was a dispute over a dollar
which Maze said Dempsey owed him.
Maze pushed DeÂ»~>psey over and kicked
him several tim< â¢? producing injuries
which the Coroner's jury decided caused
Dempsey's death.
The verdict occasioned surprise. The
attorneys tbr the defense worked on three
theoriesâ that deceased had fallen against
the iron rail near the saloon floor or was
uiyli-r the influence of opium or had fallen
the night before, producing injuries con
tributing to the fatal result. Dempsey and
Maze were well known old citizens and
the trial attracted general attention.

Whether Admiral. Dewey will bring the matter to the attention of the de
partment Is not known here, but as Hobson appears to be correct In his conclu
sion It Is doubtful If the department will, feel disposed to taJca any action.
The late Commander Wood, Â¦who commanded the Petrel In the battle. In hfs re
port said the Isla de Cuba, Isla de Luzon and Don Juan de Austria were
aground and full of water when they were fired. Their outboard valves wmtÂ»
opened and the ships allowed to fill. The. breech plug* of the four-Inch grins nad
been taken off and could not be found. By the â¢ testimony of the American
commander, therefore, the Spaniards were responsible for the sinking of the ships
named. . Department officials say the fact that the Spanish officers destroyed
their own ships does not detract from Admiral Dewe/g conduct of action, as it
was the practice of the American gunners that forced tbe enemy's men-of-war
ashore. â¢ '

Roddy were sent yesterday to Seattle, go
ing from there on tho Lawton to Fort
St. Michael, Alaska.
Lieutenant Collins, upon whom the re
sponsibility rests, promptly made out a
check and handed It to Donnelly. The
lieutenant instituted a search for the Im
postor, but was unable to find a trace of
him. and must pocket the loss unless
Â«'origress passes a bill to reimburse him.
Though thousands of dollars have passed
through the lieutenant's .fiands for the
payment of tha sick soldiers, this is the
first time he has been Imposed upon.
Brigadier General Greely. chief signal
officer ofHhe army, Is expected at the
Presidio to-day. He has been making an
inspection of the army posts In Alaska,
and will also inspect the electrical sys
tem at the Presidio. It Is presumed that
his visit is due principally to a desire to
observe the workings of the wireless.tele
graph In operation between Alcatraz Isl
and and the Presidio.
When Donnelly's | name was called a
soldierly appearing fellow stepped up and
claimed the amount due the private. No
protest coming- from those -who were sup
posed to identify the men as they were
paid, the amount due was handed over
to him and he disappeared.
Fifteen minutes afterward a soldier
giving his name as XV. Donnelly appeared'
and asked for his pay. He was very
much surprised when Informed that it
was not the custom to pay men twice.
Mis protest that he had not received a
cent led to an investigation, which result
ed in the officers concluding that they had
been made the victims- of a swindler in
the uniform of a soldier.
The patients at the General Hospital
were paid yesterday by Major Keleher.

Lord Roberts adds that he forthwith or
dered the deportation of all foreigners
arrested in connection with the plot for

Mrs. Wright, one ot the matrons
at the City Prison, is lying danger
ously 111 with blood-poisoning
caused by a bite from a spider.
About a v.eek ago Mrs. Wright,
while attending to her duties in the
matron's department of the prison,
was bitten on the left forearm by
the insect. She did not think any
thing of it at the time, but before
she left the prison to go to her
home she noticed that her arm was
considerably swollen. Acting under
the advice of a friend, she went to
the Receiving Hospital, where she
was temporarily treated. The fol
lowing day her condition became
worse and a physician was sent for.
He diagnosed the case as one of
blood-poisoning and applied the
usual remedies. Yesterday inquiry
at her home met with the re
sponse that while she was very ill
there was no immediate danger.
Mrs. Wright was formerly a
matron at the Receiving Hospital.
After the appointment of the pres
ent Board of Police Commissioners
she was assigned to duty in the
City Prison, where she performed
meritorious service.

When the RingHng circus reached this
city it brought among its large aggrega
tion "Billy Stewart." The Hackmanns,
still hopeful that their missing boy was
in the show, .wrote to Mrs. Weinstein and
appealed to her to go to the circus and
learn if he was their son. The lady car
ried out their wish and had a personal
Interview with the young man. He denied
that he was a Hebrew, but admitted that
he did not remember who his father and
mother were. Further admissions made
to Mrs. Weinstein and his close resemb
lance to the young man she rocked on her
knee in infancy strengthened her belief
that he was the prodigal. She stated to
Secretary White that the voung man was
enthusiastic over his work and refused to
admit his parentage, for fear they might
tako him away from the life he found so
fascinating.
It is thought that Mr. and Mrs. Hack
mann will come immediately to this city
and learn if "Billy Stewart," the clever
acrobat, is their long lost boy.
If the statement made yesterday to Sec
retary M. J. White of the California So
ciety for the- Prevention of Cruelty to
Chifdren by Mrs. F. Weinstein of 15B
KIssling street be true the star performer
is the long lost eon of the Hackmanns, a
well-known Hebrew family of Portland.
Or. Secretary White has been asked to
investigate the matter, and he has de
tailed Policeman Alexander to interview
the voung man. According to the story
told by the woman, a tinge of romance is
in the"life of the knight of the hippodrome
and rive-ringed show. Eleven years ago
he was a school boy in Portland. Or. His
parents were well to do, and indulged his
whims and wishes. A circus struck the
town one dav and along with other lads
be watched the preparations for the open
ing performance. He was so imbued with
the joys of circus life that he decided to
run away from home. He was aided in
his plan by a member of a troupe of
tumblers, who saw in him a likely re
cruit to the acrobatic ranks. The circus
folded its tents the next day and left the
city, taking with it the Hackmann boy,
who was then but eight years of age.
Every effort was made by the distracted
parents to gain information of their miss
ing boy. Money jvas spent, but without
avail. . No trace M_-ould be had of him.
From time to time the parents, who had
not given up the search for their son,
learned that he was in the East with a
circus. They sent inquiries, but were
foiled in their efforts., A few years ago
the boy, now grown and a finished per
former, appeared with a circus in Port
land, Or., and friends of the Hackmann
family thought they saw in the clever per
former the missing boy. They informed
the parents, but again they were disap
pointed, as the circus left the city before
they could cast their longing eyes on
their son.
As pretty a little romance as was ever
concocted by an imaginative press agent
has come to light through the coming of
Ringling's "biggest combined menagerie,
hippodrome and arenic exhibition of the
world." Every afternoon and evening a
handsome, musculurly built young
man, whose name appears on the pro
gramme as "Billy Stewart," dazzles the
large audiences by his clever acrobatic
work. He turr.s somersaults and makes
daring leaps with the ease and grace of
a tried professional performer and ac
cepts the applause of the onlookers with
the nonchalance of an artist.

"Cupid" Dan forth passed out a piece of paper yester
day that entitles the Rev. Louie Hugh of Portland to wed
almond-eyed Woo Yow Ho, the belle of the Chinese Presby
terian Mission.
The Chinese Cupid has his wings bound as tightly
as the feet of a beauty of the Flowery Land. But
Louie wooed Woo according to American ideas, for he was
young and a graduate of the Drake University of Iowa. From
a friend he learned of the mission girl's charm, and letters
passed between them. When his college days were over he
accepted a call to the Chinese Christian Church of Portland.
San Francisco is not very far trom Portland, and Louie brdke
his journey here to meet Woo, in whose letters he had be
come much interested. When he resumed his journey they
were engaged.
All this happened a year ago, and to-night Louie and
Woo will join hands and hearts at the Occidental Board of
Foreign Missions, 920 Sacramento street. The Rev. Dr.
Condit will officiate.
CHARGES OFFICIAL
WITH EXTORTION
Serious Accusation Against
Constable Ahern of
Contra Costa.
A case that will probably be inves
tigated by the Grand Jury of Contra Cos
ta County was brought to the attention
of Captain Seymour yesterday. The facts
will be laid before the District Attorney
of the county mentioned with the sugges
tion that the matter be submitted for
the consideration of the inquisitorial body.
J. C. Wells, a laboring man, called at
the Warrant Clerk's office yesterday and
asked for the arrest of Constable James
Ahern of Port Costa. Wells said that he
had been working for the last two or
three years at the Cascade tunnel on the
Great Northern Railroad. He came to
the city about eight days ago and lodged
at the France House, Third and Tehama
streets. Tuesday morning he left the city
with the Intention of going to the navy
yard at ValleJo to seek a job.
He went to* Port Costa, and when he
got on the boat to take him to Benicia
Constable Ahem placed him under arrest.
He was taken to a saloon and Ahern had
a consultation with Justice of the Peace
Casey as to what charge should be placed
against him. He was in an adjoining
room and overheard their conversation.
Casey advised Ahern. so Wells declares,
to charge him with vagrancy. He was
locked up and searched. He had $242 and
a gold watch valued at $30. He took $150
in gold from a sack in which he kept his
coin and held it in his hand, as he was
suspicious of the actions of the constable,
but the gold watch and $92 were taken
from him.
Ahern came to the city Wednesday and
went to the France House, where he made'
inquiry about Wells, particularly asking
if he had stolen any money or a gold
watch there. He was informed that noth
ing was known against Wells and noth
ing had been missed. Ahern returned to
Port Costa and advised Wells to plead !
not guilty to the charge of vagrancy and
the case was dismissed. Ahern, while re
turning Wells the property taken from
him, retained 57 for his expenses to this
city and also Wells' gold watch, accord
ing to the story told by the laborer. Wells
asked why his watch was not returned
to him and Ahern said he needed a watch
and was going to keep it.
After Wells had told his story to War
rant Clerk Greeley he was taken to'Cap
tain Seymour. No warrant could be is
sued, the offense having been committed
In Contra Costa County. Wells repeated
his story to the captain, who at once
telephoned to Port Costa for Ahem, but
found that he had gone out of town. He
wanted to hear Ahern's side of the story.
"This is one cf the worst cases I ever
heard of, if Wells' story is true," said the
captain, "and 1 will write to the District
Attorney of Contra Costa, laying the facts
before him. I honestly believe that Wells
tells a truthful story. It is an outrage
for a constable and Justice of the Peace
to connive at arresting a respectable man
Just to get their fees from the county. If
the constable in this caso had only re
tained the $7 for his expenses, which was
of itself inexcusable, there might not
have been so much reason for complaint,
but to retain his gold watch Is nothing
but robbery."
event some change is going to be made in
this line which will either take the direc
tion of a change of motive power or else
in the route.
The cause of the projected change lies
in the stress of work which has been
placed upon the McAllister-street power
house. The machinery there has been
in use for many years, and owing to the
length of its motive connections has been
subjected to wear and tear which now
necessitates Us removal or replacement.
The corporation has with marked profit
converted several of its other cable roads
into electric ones, and the preliminary ex
pense once incurred, the latter are â¢ far
and away the more economical to operate.
Only certain roads, however, can be ope
rated by electricity; these in which the
gradient is light. Should the McAllister
trolley road become a reality, passengers
will ride as heretofore on the cable road
as far as Devisadero street, where trans
fers will be given to a special line to fol
low Devisadero street tp Jackson, Central
avenue and Sixth avenue to the park. By
what route the prospective new line will
run from Central avenue to- Sixth avenue
is not stated. A saving of two miles of
rope would be effected in this way and
several minutes of time.
Another plan which has been discussed
is to cut the road off altogether at Fill
more street and issue transfers from that
point to the various park roads, the
transfers to ba good from the Flllmore
street cars.
When seen last night Superintendent of
Construction H. H. Lynch stated the
matter had been the subject of several
heart-to-heart talks among Huntington.
Vlning and himself, but that no definite
conclusion beyond the fact that a change
of some kind will be made had been
reached.
"The machinery has been called upon
by the length of cable it operates to exert
a power above its capacity," said Lynch.
"Now that it has been necessary to re
place the engines, we are trying to figure
out some way to relieve them of some of
the work, and the only way seems to be
to convert the McAllister-street road
either wholly or in part into an electric
line. Many plans are on the tapis, the
latter having received most favor. Be
yond this I don't care to give any state
ment except to say that a change of some
kind will be made. I do not think in any
event that the cable line will be cut oft*
below Fillmore street. The matter will
be taken up by the directors and action
will be taken according to their decision."
Another of the park cable roads may
shortly be converted Into a trolley line.
The McAllister-street line has of late
been the subject of much discussion
among the officials of the Market Street
Railway Company, and at the next gen
eral meeting orders may go into effect to
have the cable taken out and overhead
wires strune as a substitute. In any

Sharkey, it is said, threatens to open a saloon and
retire. If he would do both a public, subscription
might not unwisely be encouraged.
Residents of Novato appear to be in need of a
guardian. They refuse to bring Chinese malefactors
to trial because they won't believe a Chinese under

Roosevelt is rapidly running himself into a position
where he may need discipline. He is unwilling to
believe that Bryan was correctly reported because
his speech reads like arrant nonsense. It was gener
ally believed that Roosevelt knew Bryan.
Managers of the national Democracy feel aggrieved
that men of money in the party are not coming for
ward with the cash. The mourners should remember
that Bryanites do not believe in raising the wind that
way. Their leader still has his Iung9.
It is safe to say that in at least one household of
San Francisco Cupid will hereafter be barred from
the kitchen. As an agent for ptomaine poisoning'the
little fellow appears to have been something more
than could have been desired.

Mayor Phelan ought to get that library idea out of
his head. After that unfortunate park lodge affair
has come the fading of the South Park venture. His
Honor's forte is distinctly not literary.
Tn dishonoring his promise to advance teachers by

A notable illustration of the large .way in which
the characteristic generosity of the American type of
human nature works is to be found in the action
taken by many of the great manufacturing or mer
cantile firms having extensive business relations with
the merchants of Galveston. Recognizing that in the
wreck of their homes and the ruin of their business
hardly any considerable number of Galveston busi
ness men would be able to meet their obligations, the
New York Commercial suggested a general extension
of credit to all the firms of the stricken city. The sug
gestion was at once adopted, not in New York only,
but in other cities, and from the reports that come to
us it appears that ample time will be given for Gal
veston to get upon her feet and resume business be-
WHATEVER be the faults of the American
people, they have none of those defects which
arc made manifest by a lack of sympathy with
others in distress, or by niggardliness in" responding
to any appeal for help. The appalling disaster that
has befallen Texas has afforded an' opportunity for
displaying the magnificent liberality of our people in
every part of the country, and in no single section has
the opportunity been allowed to pass unheeded.
AMERICAN GENEROSITY.
Attention has been called to the possi
bility that it may fall to the lot of the
next President to effect a complete reor
ganization of the Supreme Court of the
United States during the four years be
ginning March A, 1901. The statement has
also been made that seven of the nine
Judges now constituting tho court may,
if they choose, leave the Bench within
the next four years. The following table
effectively disposes of the latter assump
tion, unless It is made on the unlikely
supposition that Justices Brewer. Brown
and White may resign before they are
entitled to retire on full pay:

It will be perceived that Justice Grav
is the only member of the court who a"t
this writing is entitled to retire on full
pay. The law is' that a Justice must
have held his commission as such ten
years and havo reached 70 years of age
during his service to be entitled to re
sign with pay.
Tinder this rule Justice Oray can re
tlro ar.v time he feels so Inclined while
Chief Justice Fuller and Justices Har
lan and Shiras may do so within the
next four years.
Justices Brewer. Brown and WhltÂ«Â»
although thrlr terms of service would
entitle them to resign with pay during
the next administration, will not be 70
years of age until Mr. McKJnloy has
completed his second term or Mr. Bryan
his first.
But tho possibility that the appoint
ment of four Justices of th*Â» Supreme
Court of the UnitPrt States may fall to
the lot of Mr. McKinley's successor Is
enough to render the election 'of Wil
liam J. Bryan Impossible. It is a pos
sibility before which every conservative
element In the ration recoils.
It is safe to say that William Jen
nings Bryan will not be intrusted with
the responsibility of selecting succes
sors to Chief Justice Fuller and Jus
tices Harlan. Gray and Shlras Im

DESPITE the efforts of the Kansas City conven
tion and Mr. Bryan to make, the fantastic
concept of "imperialism" the paramount issue
of the campaign, the sound common sense of th-i
people is not to be deceived. Even among the stal
wart Democrats who left their party in 1896 because
of the Chicago platform, and who would be glad of
an opportunity to return to it, there are many who
refuse to be deluded by the new issue. Among
these men is William B. Hornblower, whom Cleve
land once nominated for the Supreme Court of the
United States, and who is one of the most eminent
Democrats of New York. He has heard all that can
be said about imperialism, has read all that Schurz
and Cockran have to say of the "deadness" of free
coinage, but he remains convinced that Bryanism is
as menacing to the country to-day as it was four
years ago.
In a letter just made public he announces a deter
mination to vote for McKinley and Roosevelt, and
says: "The same reasons which compelled me to op
pose Bryan in 1896 compel me to oppose him in the
present campaign. All heresies, financial and Popu
listic. which were embodied in the un-Democratic
platform of i$o6 are readopted, without an attempt at
modification, by the Kansas City platform. The 16
to 1 plank is expressly reaffirmed and redeclared, and
this at the instance of Bryan himself. I cannot sup
port a candidate who still adheres to a proposition
winch, to my mind, is a monstrosity, and which, if
carried into effect, would, in my judgment, produce
untold disaster to all classes of the community and
bring dishonor and humiliation to the nation."
The view taken by Mr. Hornblower is that of a
majority of the intelligent people of the United States.
The discontented elements of the country support
Bryan to-day solely because they are convinced he
represents all that the Chicago platform declared.
He has himself given them every reason for such a
conviction. He has accepted the nomination of the
Populist party and of the Silver Republican party,
and pledged himself to their platforms. He has been 1
as vehement in denouncing the courts and govern
ment by injunction as ever he was. His denunciation
of imperialism is mixed with repeated indorsements
of all the worse features of the campaign of 1896. He
is,, in fact, as dangerous now as ever, and his election
would, as Mr. Hornblower says, "bring dishonor and
humiliation to the nation."
AS HORNELOWER SEES IT.
THE RECEPTION TO KAMN.
r~** ONGRESSMAX KAHX has as good reason
i to be gratined by the warmth of the reception
given him by his constituents and friends of
the Continental League on Wednesday evening as
they have by the ability and fidelity with which he ha?
served his district, his State and the nation in Con
gress. The occasion was a happy one in every re
spect, and is an illustration that even in campaigning
a popular and genial candidate can have something
of genuine pleasure as well as work.
Mr. Kahn's career in Congress has as yet been too
f hort to show the full merits of the man. No member
of the Hou?e can achieve a brilliant success during his
first session, nor accomplish very much by individual
cuort. It is for that icason that experience in Con
gress counts for so much. Nevertheless a member
who is willing and faithful in the performance of
committee work, who gives ready and earnest help to
his colleagues in all that offers to advance the welfare
of the State and the nation, can accomplish results of
great benefit to his constituents. That sort of mem
1'cr Mr. Kahn has been, and as a consequence his
friend? can proudly point to a record of legislative
work that attests his fitness for a Congressional career
and his right to expect a re-election at the hands ol
his constituents.
In a brief review of the legislation with which Mr.
Kahn was associated in Congress, and which was in a
considerable measure due to his earnest and able ef
forts, the chairman of the evening referred particularly
10 the appropriation for the Federal quarantine sta
tion at Angel Island, appropriations for other im
provements not only in this harbor but elsewhere in
the State, the grant of Government contracts for army
si-ppiics to California manufacturers, the exclusion of
Chinese immigration from Hawaii, and the movement
in Congress which led to the edict of the Japanese
Government restricting Japanese immigration to this
country- The*e are examples of the measures which
Mr. Knhn was strenuous in advancing and by which
lie demonstrated his keen interest in all that concerns
the welfare of California and the interests of her
people.
Since Mr. Kahn his thus proven his ability and his
fidelity in Congress, lie should by all means be re
elected. The experience he has now acquired will be
of vast advantage to him hereafter, and in his second
term he will be able to render much more important
fervice to his constituents than he has done in the
paÂ«-t. At present he is in line of promotion in com
mittee work, and with each succeeding session his in
fluence in committee and on the floor will increase.
If he be rejected at this election and a new man
chosen, the voters of the Fourth District will once
more have in Washington an inexperienced represen
tative, and. moreover, one ;vho can hardly be expected
to equal Mr. Kahn in zeal, eloquence, fidelity and
business capacity.
The people of the Fifth Congressional District by
repeatedly re-electinpr Mr. Loud have now the satis
faction of having their representative at the head of
the important Committee on Postofiices and Post
roads. The voters of the Fourth will do well to profit
by the example. They have in Mr. Kahn a represen
tative capable of minjr to the front rank of parlia
mentary debaters â one who is known to be thor
oughly loyal to the jrreat principles of the Republican
party and devoted to the welfare of California. He
should have in this contest the vote of every Repub-
Tioan and of every independent voter in the Fourth
District.
quired from the sovereign owner as one of
the fruits of war.
In ir.y humble judgment. Presidential
elections come too often, as we no sooner
establish a policy which brings or main
tains prosperity, than those out of office
sock to overthrow it and oftentimes seize
upon false issues and employ Insincere
argument for the purpose of prejudicing
the voter. Our duty i3 to our country
first and to our party second. No change
in the policy of the Government should be
made unless it is apparent that pome
abuse Is to be corrected or som- material
advantage to be gained. It is the duty
of every American citizen, whether he be
a Republican or a Democrat, to sustain
the President whenever he is enforcing
our rights given by a treaty solemnly
ratified by our Senate. The President in
his administration should not%attempt to
feel the popular pulse or cater to the
whims and caprices of theoretical states
men, but administer governmental affairs
from a standpoint of constitutional right,
preserving property interests and dis
charging our obligations to other govern
ments as Imposed upon-us by the law of
nations when we assumed the sovereignty
over the Philippine Islands.
I cannot see how the election of Mr.
Bryan to the Presidency will bring any
more prosperity to this nation, and, as
his election would be a repudiation of Mc-
Kinley's Philippine policy, which I favor,
and of the treaty with Spain, the ratifica
tion of which Mr. Bryan favored, I there
fore must withdraw my adherence to the
Democratic party and cast my allegiance,
for the present campaign at least, with
the Republican. Yours very truly,

UTTERANCE
UNREGISTERED CITIZENS,
J\A ANY a man who would be loud and vehement
/ \ in denunciation of the Government if he were
disfranchised by law is seemingly willing to
disfranchise himself through mere indifference to the
value of that privilege for which he would be willing
to fight if he were denied it. The day for the closing
of registration is near at hand, and still a considerable
percentage of those who are legally entitled to vote
have neglected to place their names upon the roll of
voters.
It has been suggested that many citizens are un
aware of the fact that all voters must be registered
this year, that prior registration counts for nothing
If such be the case if will be worth while to repeat
again what all should bear in mind, that all registra
tions prior to January i, 1900, have been canceled.
The law requires every citizen to register if he desire
to vote at the coming election. There is no exception
to the rule.. If you have not registered since January
1 you must do so before September 26 or forfeit your
right to vote.
It is difficult to understand why any one should be
indifferent to the issues of the State and of the nation
that are involved in this contest. Upon the one side
is a party upholding the existing order of prosperity,
and upon the other is a powerful coalition of the
forces of discontent â silver men, Populists and Demo
crats, combined to assail the foundations upon which
that prosperity rests. The fiscal system of protection,
which sustains our industries, and the financial sys
tem, which gives stability to our currency, are alike
subject to attack. How can any intelligent man b;
indifferent to such issues?
There are many thousands of voters yet to be reg
istered, and but a few days remain in which registra
tion can be effected. There is sure to be a great rush
on the closing days, and some who wait for the last
day. may not be able to register at all. â¢ The thing is
up to you. Have you registered? If you have not
you would better make good use of to-day.

pense Incurred in the warfare and
the detriment suffered to property Inter
ests, and that, therefore, both as a mat
ter of precedent and as Inherent ri&ht,
our Government was justified by treaty
with Spain in acquiring the Philippines,
ana further that the fact that some at

Government of Spain had been oppres
sive, did not give to them tho right to

Tho Philippines are now In rebellion
agalnsk the authority of tho United
States, and, for my part,' I believe that
this rebellion should be crushed, and
that, until the authority of our Govern
ment is recognized, no negotiations to
ward peace should be had. By acquiring
the Philippines we have undertaken new
responsibilities and are liable to the gov
ernments of the world for the proper
preservation of property rights and main
tenance of good government. In my judg
ment, this can be brought about at the
present time only by the authority of our
Government being recognized and re
spected.
"Wh'ether or not it was the wisest thing
from , a business standpoint to pay the
Spanish Government $20,000,000 bonus for
the transfer of the Philippines is no con
cern of the present. The question now is:
Shall we put down a rebellion against our
authority rightfully acquired and recog
nized by all the world, or play the cow
ard, send our troops home, leave the
property interests of our citizens and
those of foreigners which we are obli
gated to protect by virtue of assuming
sovereignty, to be looted and destroyed
by a rebellious force, the leaders of which,
instead of being inspired In the cause of
liberty against tyranny and oppression,
are inflamed and crazed with a lust for
power and dominion?
I favor the continuance of the war until
thi? authority of the United States Is rec
ognized from one end of the Philippine
Islands to the other, until every rebel has
laid down his arms and until the islands
are thus completely pacified, no negotia
tions of any kind should be had with the
Filipinos and no promises held out to
them. The cry of imperialism does not
influence mo In the least. It is uaed to
prejudice the unthinking voter and blind
tho judgment of those good but nils
guided citizens who fall to observe the
distinction between the acquisition of ter
ritory as the result of war and the estab

policy. The American people will never
favor imperialism as rightfully under
stood, but at the same time they will
never consent to the abandonment of ter

COLONEL. BRYAN occasionally lapses into
humor. When the dispatches from Kansas City
announced the ovation to Hill in the national
convention and that Hill shook his head, Colonel
Bryan said, "There was probably a fly on Mr. Hull's
nose and his hands were engaged, so he had to shake
it off."
His newspapers have been in a state of exaltation
and exultation over the accession of Richard Olney
and William L. Wilson. They were members of Mr.
Cleveland's last Cabinet. They were Gold Demo
crats. They were believed to be influential with the
Gold Democracy. Colonel Bryan's managers have
been most anxious to secure the alliance of the Gold
Democrats. To do this they have snubbed silver and
spat upon the Kansas City platform, and promised
that Bryan will fall down and worship the gold stan
dard and all its works. This was gratifying to the
Gold Democrats who desired to affiliate. They fe!t
flattered. Their importance was recognized and they
became objects of attention as soon as they abandoned
their wicked backsliding and went into probation
again.
It was working smoothly, and Chairman Jones,
Secretary Walsh, Editor Abbott, Coin Harvey and
Buck Heinrichsen were pleased to welcome the wan
dering sinners home. There immediately appeared
to the Bryanistic mind's eye a charming vista, hung
on either side vrith electoral votes as thick as Chinese
lanterns at the feast of the dragon. At the farther
end were the bubbling fleshpots, full of burgoo, racks
piled high with fodder and cribs bursting with corn
for the fattening of the lean kine. Timbrel and psalter,
banjo and bones, sweetened the air with the notes of
victory, and at the hither end of the enchanted lane
entered the head of the procession, every man untying
his gaberlunzie to replace it with the raiment of
luxury which hung further on. From the farther end
of this day dream conld be seen the rear guard of the
conquered, scowling back at the conquerors, shivering
in anticipation of the zude blasts that were combing
the blear landscape over which the outs and the
ousted must march to Salt River. Just as this ecstatic
vision was at its height, and Richard Olney was seen
marching arm in arm with Altgcld and William L.
WilsQti was receiving ;i lesson in finance from Calam
ity Weiler, and the scene was staged in all its happi
ness and magnificence, unfortunately Colonel Bryan
was seized with the hee-haws. He had an attack of
humor. His vast versatility took possession of him.
That levity which made Nero indulge in ragtime while
Rome burned, that lack of sense of the sober fitness
of things which made George II, when notified of the
death of the King, his father, and his own accession,
exclaim "Dat is von tamm lie," overcame Colonei
Bryan. His day for humor arrived and his lighter
vein must be indulged. He had curbed it since that
fine conception of a fly on Hill's ncJse, but what is
bred in the bone must come out in the flesh. Colonel
Bryan cannot always do tragedy. He must have a
chance at comedy, even if the republic is in danger.
His opportunity came at a reception by the
Nebraska Bryan Club of Chicago. It is made up of
former Xebraskans, who were frightened away from
that State by Bryan's picture of calamity that fell- upon
it like a pall. Mr. Martin V. Gannon, who has given
eftice a chance to hunt him and has wig-wagged and
megaphoned it, unsuccessfully, in Iowa, Nebraska
and Illinois, is president of the club. He introduced
Colonel Bryan to the throng that hung upon his
words. Then Colonel Bryan opened his mouth and
the store of pearls mixed in the proportion of one
pearl to two personal pronouns, first person, singular
number, poured forth, like ribbons from the jowls
of a conjurer.
He said: "Great changes are taking place. I am glad
to meet here not only those who were with me in the
early days, but I am glad to meet some who. were
against me in the early days. I find here persons who
voted against me in 1896 and I am glad to meet them.
I have a forgiving nature. I am perfectly willing to
forgive all who voted against me in 1896, provided
they bring forth works meet for repentance. I am
glad to get back the Gold Democrats who wandered
away. If I had known so many were coming I would
have made arrangements to have had manufactured a
large number of candy fatted calves, to give to those
returning as evidence that the prodigal is welcome at
home." There now is elevation of thought and re
finement of humorl Olney and Wilson might have
had a candy calf, a sugary, succulent, sweet and sac
charine calf, to suck if they had only given notice
afar that they.intended to arise and go to the house of
their father, Bryan. What a dignified welcome to the
returning statesmen! What a high estimate of their
reasons and their usefulness 1 How gratified they
must be that they return not to a party, not to a com
pany of men agreed upon some great principle, but
to "me," Bryan.
If this jocund state continue and this effervescent
humor grow, it will be dangerous to trust Mr. Bryan
in the White House. The picture of the father of his
country in the great East room will laugh its false
teeth out on the floor, and his stately spouse will de
range the "do" of her hair in cachinnation. When
Mr. Bryan walks abroad "Jackson, sitting his rearing
horse in ramrod uprightness, will drop the reins to
slap his verdigris thighs and haw-haw 1 While
Lafayette, near by, will drop his well sustained grav
ity and with his bronze slats tickling will shout,
"C'est a rire."
For their reward Messrs. Olney and Wilson /must
take the satisfaction of being the cause of this irides
cent, opalescent, pungent, penetrating and irresistible
sally. Let the resources of the confectioner be drawn
upon at once to reduce it to sugar. The season bf the
fatted calf is on. Children cry for 'cm, and no re
turned Gold Democrat should be forgotten.
THE CANDY CALF CANDIDATE.
fore there will be any call upon her for payment of
money due.
In all this splendid showing it is gratifying that San
Francisco stands among the foremost cities and Cali
fornia among the most generous States in responding
to the call for help. Our people recognize that their
abundant prosperity should render them helpful to all
who arc in distress, and accordingly the contributions
thus far made compare well with those of any other
community in the United States.
- There is one feature of the calamity that must not
be overlooked. The early reports from the disaster,
instead of being exaggerations, are now known to
have fallen far short of the full extent of the loss.
Not Galveston only but all the Texan coast has suf
fered. The latest estimate gives the total number of
deaths at about 12,000, and the value of property de
stroyed is calculated to exceed $20,000,000. It is
clearly 110 time to let up in the relief work. Make
yowr contributions liberally and promptly. California
has. not yet done all in this dread emergency she
should do.

Captain Brandenburg, who brings the
Herodot Into port, was formerly chief of
ficer of tho Tanis. He was also here in
1861 in the s-hip Count Louis, and has
therefore a number of friends here- Chief
Ollicer E. Moller has quite a string of rel
atives In San Francisco, so his visit to
California is sure to be a pleaÂ»ant one.
Captain Brandenburg says that after tho
encounter with the Indians he decided not
to try Smythe Channel, and so stood out
to sea. Very heavy weather was encoun
tered from that on to Coronel, but after
that the Herodot had fair weather to port.
The next day two of the Tierra del Fue
gans boaJded the Herodot and asked for
something to eat. Soap Beemed to bo a
delight to them, and when Captain Bran
denburg gave them two or three pieces of
the scented variety their joy knew no
bounds. They'ate it an inch at a bite and
rolled it under their tongues as a sweet
morsel. The ordinary washing eoap that
comes in long bars was eaten with relish
by the other men in the canoes, and had it
been possible to utilize It the whole land
of Tierra del Fuego could, have been
bought for a case of common, ordinary
washing eoap. .
"When an anchorage was made a double
watch was set, and it was well for all
hands that Captain Brandenburg took
such a precaution. The Indians crept up
when all hands were supposed to be asleep
and tired arrows aboard tipped with tow
and lighted In the fires kept constantly
burning in the bow of the canoes. Had
there been no lookout the Herodot would
have been burned to the water's edge and
looted, but as It was, no harm was done,
es the crew turned out and extinguished
the fires.
Tho latest vessel to run the gauntlet was
the Kosmos liner Herodot. She was on
her way here from Hamburg and made
the long voyage in 102 days. When the
steamer passed Sand Point on the west
erly entrance to the Straits of Magellan
a gale was blowing. Captain Branden
burg knew his way, however, and the big
liner went along as though nothing was
out of the way. Everything went along
without incident until the steamer was
within a few hours' sail of Smythe Chan
nel. Then a number of canoes showed up
on the starboard quarter as the Herodot
was slowed down tor the night.
fcBDraalERRA DEL FUEGO seems to be
g^ lending a whole lot of interest
Â§ to the passage of the Straits of
J. Magellan. "The Land of Fire"
seems to keep up Its name, as
every native who leaves that inhospitable
shore carries In his canoe a "fire" that Is
rover allowed to go out. Once extin
guished, tho men and women who live in
the frail bark are likely to die, but alight
and In good working order the small flame
has proved a menace to many a good ship
that has essayed the passage of the
Straits of Magellan.

THE KOSMOS LINER HERODOT THAT ARRIVED FROM HAMBURG YESTERDAY. THE OFFICERS OF THE
STEAMSHIP TELL. A THRILLING STORY OF NARROW ESCAPE FROM THE TERRA DEL FUEGANS IN
THE STRAITS* OF MAGELLAN.
The fashions were transmitted In a curi
ous way. Dolls, or puiÂ»pets. as they were
called In the eighteenth century, were at
tired in the prevailing mode and were sent
to the various court3 of Europe. AftÂ»r
a while, they were sent to the colonies
from town to town and- from house to
house. Quaint advertisements were placed
in the newspapers stating when these
fashion dolls would be on exhibition. At
the stated hour the belles of the place
In 18G0 there was in England no system
of Government education, and as late as
1313 half the children never saw the Inside
of a school. The education of the poor
was entirely the work of private charity.
The education of a gentleman in 1S00
would to-day be considered a very poor
affairâ a smattering of Latin and Greek
and a full course in dancing and gal
lantry. With noble ladies the course was
still more superficial, ceasing entirely at
14, when tho dissipations of fashionable
society were entered. In America, on the
contraryâ In New England especiallyâ the
women had better educational opportuni
ties than tho men, not so much In tho
schools as In tha time for hornÂ© study.
During Jefferson's administration (1SO1-(W>
colleges and universities were established
In almost every State. In 1SOÂ« five col
lege students who were . unexpectedly
caught in a storm united in an impromptu
"haystack prayer-meeting," the outcome
of which was the first foreign missionary
society. in America. Delegates to other
colleges kindled the . same spirit, and
shortly afterward tho American Board of
Foreign Missions was established. The
American Bible Society was also founded
about this time. By the beginning of the
nineteenth century. Methodists, Presby
terians, Episcopalians, Roman Catholics,
Friends and Unitarians had Independent
organizations flourishing under the first
constitutional amendment, which states
that "Congress shall make no law respect
ing an establishment of religion or pro
hibiting the free exercise thereof." The
remainder of the amendment forbidding
"the abridgment of tho freedom of
speech or of the press" was one of the
foundation stones upon which the success
of our Government was bullded. In Franco
the freedom of the press was alternately
permitted and repressed; in Germany,
nred by the French Revolution .of 1S4S.
the Teutonic demands for a free press
found expression in street riots, while In
England less than 100 years ago news
papers were taxed 4 pence a copy, osten
sibly to assist in the payment of Nie ex
penses of the Napoleonic wars, but in
reality to render them too costly for the
poor and thus control their anticipated
evil Influence over tho masses.
With the establishment of free press,
free church, free schools and increased
traveling facilities neighborhood Jealousy
and prejudice gradually disappeared, to
gether with that coarseness and brutality
so painfully common during the eight
eenth century- It was no longer consid
ered seemly for ladles, lawyers. Judges
and Kings to interlard their conversation
with the fashlonabl- profanity. Popular
opinion gradually ceased to sanction the
impressment of seamen, the maintenance
of raval and military discipline by the
lash, the torture of criminals and the
daily domestic beating of wives and chil
dren. As the century wore on many piti
able laws were annulled, drunkenness
was no longer viewed as a matter of
course and many cruelties consequent to
the general intoxication disappeared.
In America the evolution of society is
especially worthy of Btudy. developing
from unusual conditions along the same
general line of progress which has char
acterized the advancing civilization of
other countries. When it became possi
ble for the people of America to exchange
heroism for the homely routine of dally
life society as wo now understand It prac
tically did" not exist, for it was In a form
ative condition. It was but natural that
independence in political feeling and the
ever-changing conditions of home life
should permeate all social relations and
level forever class distinction. Although
owing its very existence to the absence
of an inherited nobility, social conditions
In the infancy of the republic labored un
der the disadvantage under which It still
suffers, that of having no permanence,
being at the beck and call of politics,
trusts, wealth or culture â sometimes a
gregarious mass of all these controlling
forces, or with special traits predominat
ing according to local conditions.
In 1S00 the entire population of the
United States was about e^ual to the
present population of Pennsylvania.
Thomas Jefferson had just been elected
to the Presidency and journeyed on horse
back to the capital, 1 which had been re
moved the preceding year from Philadel
phia to the District of Columbia. Our
handsome city of Washington "was then
a strange conglomeration of splendid
buildings, half finished, and wretched
huts." Washington's death had just
plunged the country into the deepest
grief, which found curious expression In
a deluge of mourning designs and lauda
tory mottoes printed, embroidered,
stamped upon chinaâ pictures of the pa
triot's tomb and other funereal emblems
hanging upon every wall. Not until the
administration of President Monroe did
the local quarrels and varying politics at
tain any harmony: then the "era of good
feeling" set In in earnest. Aristocratic in
birth, Jefferson nevertheless took gTeat
pride In the assumption of that democratic
simplicity which Is proverbially associated
with his name. He abolished the state
carriage, liveried servants and public
levees Inaugurated by Washington. His
dress was ostentatiously plain for those
days, when the attire of the men fre
quently surpassed that of the women In
richness; pantaloons were substituted for
breeches and leather strings for buckles.
While many of the people followed In the
lead of their chief executive, others de
plored his ultra-republican simplicity,
averring that "with small clothes and
breeches the high tone of society de
parted."
Washington had had some difficulty
with this Spartan contempt for conven
tionalities. The never-to-be-forgotten pa
triot. Patrick Henry, declined several
Government positions, declaring severely
that his plain habits of life rendered him
unfit to associate with those who were
aping the ways of monarchy. As a rule. :
however, Washington had Rreater diffi
culty in curbing the reactionary love of
finery which was but the Inevitable out
come of so many years of repre?sion and
hardship. During his second term the
French Revolution was working out Its
terrible destiny and had sent to this
country as its representative Citizen
Genet who was enthusiastically received
by the Americans. At the risk of hi.i
popularity Washington preserved the
strictest International neutrality. Ho
could repress the wearing of cockades,
dancing around the red-capped liberty
pole and the singing of the carmagnole,
but he could not stem th#Â» adoption of
French fashions, which continues down to
our own day. In spite of the disgust of
conservative Americans, empire dresses
with low corsage and scant skirt were
eagerly worn. The men more slowly re
linquished the picturesque colonial dress
which so well set oft "V\ aahlngton's man
ly bearing for the French mode, but after
a twenty years' struggle they succumbed
to the pantaloons. At the time of the in
troduction of these garments they were
worn tight-fitting and let into the shoes.
A gentleman of ISOO, after describing at
length the miseries which he endured
when wearing the boots of the periodâal
beit he demeaned himself as though ho
were "a carpet knight .capering upon rosÂ«
leaves"â concludes the description of his
attire with the following: "The panta
loons (over which I wore the boots) were
of non-elastic corduroy. It would bÂ© un
just to my tailor to scy that they were
fitted like my skin: they sat -a great deal
closer. When I took them off my legs
were like fluted pillars, grooved with the
cjhrds of the pantaloons. 1. Â¦
Despite the excruciating pangs Incident
to the adoption of fashions from France,
we are Indebted to the people of that
country for m.nny of our most comfort
able customs. To them we owe the estab
lishment of public baths and an Increas
ing love of personal cleanliness. They also

XI.
(Concluded.)
President Madison and his vlvaefotia lit
tle wife re-established thÂ« Presidential
levees inaugurated by Mr. and Mrs.
Â¦Washington, and to this day these stat*
functions still furnish a fund of anecdote
and delightful legend during each admin
istration, and are distinctive features of
the kaleidoscopic society at the capital.
Naturally custom and fashion swayed
from one extreme to the other during th>i
unsettled days following the close of the
Revolutionary War, but within twenty
years after the founding of the republic
the country had entered upon the devel
opment of that career which ha3 becomo
its most distinguishing feature. During
the transitional period Inventions, com
merce, education, agriculture, every In
dustry received a marked impulse anil
home comforts became rapidly more nu
merous. The use of coal, at tlrst employ
ed for repairing the highway, came to be
more generally understood. Franklin's
stove, called by a friend "Franklin's little
demon," began to replace the hospitable
"clean-wingd hearth"; carpets wero
spread in the middle portion of the room,
around which the proud owners" mad**
stealthy progress lest their footfall*
might mar the beauty of their new pos
sessions. Books, always prized In the col
onies, became more abundant and more
helpful, especially after Franklin estab
lished the first circulating library. This
wise statesman was also the first Post
master General and greatly perfected the
mall facilities. Thus In the peaceful dav.-Â»
nearly a century ago the art of gentlo
living, assisted by the great wealth of
Southern planters and Northern business
men, found ample opportunity for devel
opment.
Much care was bestowed both by men
and women upon their church attire, th*Â»
result In most Instances being a meeting
garb that, judged by modern standards,
was slightly eccentric. For instance,
aprons were at one time considered fash
ionable adjuncts of tlress. Women wore
them proudly to the Arch-street Presby
terian Church; Puritans added them Â»n
shades of scarlet as an offset to their
sad-colored gowns, and even thÂ«Â» F*riend*
complacently added this touch of blue or
green to their dove-colored raiment.
"Whatever the attire. It was completely
shallowed up by the hlgh-harkpd. box
phaped pews whose -uninviting appearance
is best described t>y the ejaculation of
the nineteenth-century child who exclaim
ed when first taken to service In an old
fashioned church, "What! must I be shut
up In a closet and sit on a shelf?" ThfP>>
shelf seats -were hinged and could bfÂ»
turned up against th^ "pups" or "pits."
Quite the most exciting scenes In tho
primitive churches occ\:rrrd in the "hoys*
pue." a high gallery remote from oth^r
worshipers. wherein our great-great
grandfathers defied the vigilance of thft
tithing man and of th* special guardians
appointed by the meeting. As late as 1S4.">
these "devil's playhouses" were In exist
ence in Connecticut: by that time the nat
ural remedy of returning the miscreants
to the family pews occurred to our dis
tracted forefathers, then the wicked ceas
ed from troubling en masse and Individ
ual turbulence died out of loneliness.
frathered at the milliners', drank their tea
from a "cheny" cup. ate the tea leaves
dressed with butter and vivaciously dis
cussed the new fashions. Upon their re
turn many instantly discarded the his?
towering headdre33 t or the "Queen 9
nightcap." familiar to us in the pictures
of Martha Washington, and resolved
forthwith to dress their hair in the stylo
of the Goddess of Liberty; then the
rage in France. When the attire of these
dolls became too antiquated for further
circulation the "Flanders babies." so
called because the finesÂ»c were made in
Holland, were graduated from tho show
room to tho nursery, where they queened
it over thair homemade brothers and Bis
ters. These battered fashion dolls were
as eagerly coaxed for by the little maids
of 1S0O as are discarded fashion plates for
paper dolls by the children of to-day.
At the beginning of the century gentle
men invariably wore their faces clean
shaven, after the manner of the Gibson
men of to-day. Tho Â«Â«men, however,
bore little resemblance to their more ro
bust kindred of the nineteenth century. In
our great-grandmother's day a premium
seemed to have been put upon delicate
health or at least upon the appearance of
it. Young girls then were cloth or velvet
masks and other paraphernalia to pro
tect their sensitive skins from tan. W hen
wo read that little Mistress Payne, after
ward Dolly Madison, went to school ar
rayed in Il a white linen mask to keep
every ray of sunshine from her com
plexion, a sunbonnet sewed on her heart
every morning by her careful mother
and long gloves- covering the hands and
arms." we feel that there are some com
pensations for the healthful outdoor life
of the sunburnfd golf-playlnc girl on the
threshold of the twentieth century.

CHICAGO. Sept. 20.â Liquidation In lines of
all sorts and sizes flooded the wheat pit all
day. This was because Liverpool waa up only
V t <\ in the face of the bulge here yesterday and
because clear weather was predicted for tha
Northwest. The Idea that it is well to mai
ket a commodity while the demand still existfc
was also a factor in the slump which marked
to-day's trading. There were considerations on
the other Fide of the fenceâ such as higher
English country markets and strength at Lon
don, as well as rain In the Northwest early â
but they did not count. October opened at
7S%c to 79Hc One big long sÂ«;t the ball rolling
down hill and the courte thus indicated wis
followed hy numerous others. There waa con
siderable stop-loss selling under 77>ic. Before
the eni had come October had dropped to
77%Â©77Hc and the close was l>;c under yes
terday at TT'^c.
Corn was quiet and dull, paying but Httle
attention to wheat. October closed >ic lower
at SSUc.
Trade in oats was of a small local ordei,
but the market was steady. October closed
unchanged at 21'4Â®21's.ic.
Provisions were firm, the cash demand still
being good and stocks low with heavy ship
ments of products In prospect. October pork
closed 12Vjc higher, lard 10c higher and ribs
5c better.

"WHEAT â Liverpool was firmer. New York
waa lower. Chicago was weaker, and the eell
lnsr pressure was resumed, with Cudahy lead
ing. In response to a telegram of Inquiry from
this city Cudahy wired that he did not think
that we will see much higher prices for wheat
for some time. There was fair buying at 78c,
and though the crowd was bearish and there
waa a neneral desire to realize, the strength
In the Northwest prevented a marked decline.
The weall-.er there continued bad. There was
general liquidation In all foreign markets, and
foreigners sold at Chicago.

"Last night's disturbance was not an

Tho shock occurred at the moment the

ATHLETIC MEET
T HE Republicans of San Francisco in
Â¦ convention assembled declare their un
qualified devotion to the principles of
the national Republican party as* enunci
ated In the platform adopted at Philadel
phia, and they hereby express their un- .
bounded admiration and affection for Mc-
Klnlei- and Roosevelt, who have been se
lected by the party to carry the banner of
Republicanism to another national victory.
We commend the splendid, the glorious
achievements of the administration of Pre*i
confldence In his re-elfctlon.
Fan Francisco, during the term of Presi
dent McKlnlfy, has prospered as never be
fore: s:>lf-!nterÂ«>ja. if nothing else, should
incline the citizens of our city to vote for
the retention of the Republican party in
power; hut no appeal to th<Â» people of thi3
metropolis ot the Pacific West upon higher
upon nobler grounds. The Republican
party stands for national grandeur and
glory; for human rights; for a national pol
icy of protection to Aim-rican Industries and
American labor; for souwi money and finan
cial Integrity. MeKinley and Roosevelt are
the personal embodiment of these prlnct*
pics, of these ideas. The future of Cali
fornia and of our great city Is wrapped up
in the continuance of the nations.! Repub
lican party in power.
WÂ© indorse to the fullest extent the ad
mirable platform adopted by the Republican
party of California at the State convention
recently held at Santa Cruz. TVe have no
local 'issue in Sa.n Francisco this year and
we take the occasion to appeal to the peo
ple of the city to elect Republican Senators
and Assemblymen to the end that we may
secure the passage of a Just apportionment
bill and carry out thÂ» purposes and policies
indorsed and advocated by tho party in the
Santa Cruz platform.
We especially lndor.=e the commendation
of our Governor. Henry T. Gage, for the
able, fearless and economical manner in
which the State Government has been con
ducted under his administration.
We heartily approve the course followed
by our Representatives in Congress, Julius
Kahn and Eugene F. Loud, and earnestly
commend them to the voters of their dis
tricts for re-election.
We declare ourselves and the Republican
party unreservedly in favor of the adoption
of the proposed amendment- to the constitu
tion of the State, providing for a primary
election law; and we earnestly urge upon
the' electors of the city and county of San
Francisco, without distinction of party, the
support of tho amendment, to the end that
party organization may be placed upon a
secure basis and made to represent the will
of the party, freed from the control of boss
rule, and -we Instruct our Senators and As
semblymen to do everything In their power
to secure the enactment of a new primary
election law In conformity to the amend
ment which, we. confidently believe, will
be ratified.
We favor the adoption of the proposed
amendment to the constitution of the State,
providing for the establishment of District
Appellate Courts.
We heartily Indorse the plank in the State
platform of our party which pledges addi-
.tlonal financial aid to the university
through the comlnB Legislature.
We pledKe, our Legislative nominees to a.
strictly economical administration of State
affairs, assuring the taxpayer that the bur
dens of government will be maintained at
the lowest point consistent with a. proper
administration of the affairs of State and a
due regard for the good name and stand
ing of our commonwealth.
Let the Republicans of San Fnanclsco
stand together during this national cam
palK" and uphold the administration of
President MeKinley. Let it not bÂ« said that
San Francisco, whose people have prospered
more than those of any other city In the
Union, have been ungrateful for tho benefits
they have received. Let the citizens of this
metropolis of the golden West, in this year
of our semi-centennial, vote for MeKinley
and Roosevelt, for protection and prosperity^
for sound money and for. national gran
deur and glory. I<et us, in a word, sustain
the national Republican party as the rep
resentative of national unity, of human lib
erty, of financial integrity and of the policy
of protection, â as the embodiment of the
wisest political policies and the purest
political principles of the age.

"A motion," yelled Ruef. "You hayej,

a motion cognate to this report. J,
Bergerot's gavel dropped on Ruef 8 pro- Â»
test and Dinkelspiel was finally permitted J.
to read the Ketly-Crlmmlns "order of t>us->
iness " He had scarcely begun whenj,
Ruef disgustedly moved that the report .
be adopted without reading. He was.,
seconded by almost all of the decent ele-t
ment in the house. Bergerot started toj,
put the Question, but his work was tool
raw for even Martin Kelly and he with J,
others round him demanded that the re-,1,
port bo read.
Then Dinkelspiel finished and BergerotW
again started to put the question when
L. A. Rae of the Korty-fourth Jumped to
the platform with a minority report, for
which ho demanded a hearing. Bergerot
attempted to suppress him, but the anti-
Kelly force would not have It ana ne was
finally allowed to proceed.
The Kelly-Crimmins report recommend
ed that the temporary otticers of the con
vention be made permanent and that the
following additional officers be appointed:
Gc-orge B. Wells, vice chairman; Josepn
Tune, sergeant at "arms, and John fa.

GRILTuTN'G FOB BERGEROT.
George L. Center Publicly Denounces
Him in Most Scathing "Words.
The minority report declared against
the maintenance of the temporary officers
and provided instead.for the election of
a permanent chairman and secretary. It
differed from the majority report most
notably In that it provided that the pres
ent County Committee should not be
changed and in support of this it set
forth that the present body was elected
to a two-year term, which would not ex
pire until the next annual municipal con
vention.
At the moment he finished the reading
of his report Kae moved that it be sub
stituted for the majority report and was
quickly seconded by Ruef. Bergerot at
tcmptf'd to lose the motion, but in the
end Ruef's insistence forced him to put
the question, but a vote was not had be
fore the then badly rattled chairman had
made a quarter of a dozen contradictory
rulings and broken nearly every staple
rule set down in parliamentary procedure.
So evident were his efforts to work the
will of his master that the clean element
on the floor, and of it wore many who
had known Rergerot for the best years
of his life, openly repudiated him and re
proved him with hisses that must have
been heard outside the hall and above the
uproar that had been raised.
One of Bergerot's one-t^ne admirers,
George L. Center of the Thirty-fourth
Assembly District, was not satisfied with
any such rebuke. Leaving his seat he
approached the stand and in most scath
ing terms voiced not only the opinion of
himself, but of the decent, high-minded
element which he represented. He ac
cused Bergerot of applying gag rule to
every one who offered fight to Keily and
his henchmen: of stating motions other
than those that had been made; of abus
ing . parliamentary law and usage, and
then Center finished on him m the follow
ing fierce arraignment:
"Mr. Bergerot, I have known you for
years. I have known your family and
there is none better in the city. 1 have
watched your course, 'and have admired
youâ until to-night. ' By your actions in
this convention you have shown me that
ynu have left your career to stoop before
the bosses and that you stand ready to
do their every bidding. You have dis
graced yourself, you have disgraced your
family, your party and your city. I am
disgusted with you and wash my handa
of you. I shall now leave this hall, for
I decline to sit in any convention of which
Martin Kelly Is master.'*
And then, not deigning: Chairman
Bergerot the opportunity oi repiy, ne
turned and left the hall.
The motion to substitute the minority
report was lost and after still another up
roar the original motion of Dinkelsplel
to adopt the majority report was car
ried.
The report of the committee on plat
form and resolutions, the Kelly heelers
allowed to be read without interruption.
It was presented by Thomas P. Wood
ward, chairman of the committee, and
was adopted unanimously and with rous
ing cheers by both factions. A motion to
adjourn, carrying with it instructions to
the numerous Assembly and Senatorial
delegations to report their hominees next
Monday night, was then put and carried.
Monday evening next was set as the
date of the next session and upon that
occasion the nominations stated in the
order of business will be made.

DELEGATES OF THIRTY-FOURTH
Split Between Supporters of County
Committee and Other Members.
Harmony Hall, Mission and Erie
streets, was either named or has
been rented to the' wrong party. A dis
cordant clash opened the meeting of tha
Bryan and Stevenson Thirty-fourth Dis
trict Club last evening and an adjourn
ment was ordered only after a squabble.
The meeting was called to order for tho
purpose of nominating delegates to the
judicial and legislative convention.
There is a division In the club, one fac
tion being opposed to tho dictations of the
County Committee, the other standing
ever ready to obey its mandates. This led
to endless squabbling. Warm and venom
: ous personalities were indulged in until
i County Commltteeman J. H. Hanson suc
â¢ cessfully pleaded for harmony until after
the meeting, granting the club members
the right, however, after adjournment, to
"go forfh into the street and cut each
other's throat if they so desired."
The work of nominating delegates
brought on much opposition, but it was
finally voted to select a 'committee, of four
to receive the names of those nominated
by the club and from them the committee
of four to select seventeen delegates. T.
Boland, A. Phillips, 3. H. Hanson and P.
H. Flynn were appointed to act as the
committee of four.
About fifty members of the club were
placed In nomination, and from the list
the following were appointed as dele
gates to the convention:
M. Murphy. P. S. Hlgpins. A. Phillips, John
A. N. Hickey. Thomas F. Alford. J. E.
O'Brien, Joseph Corrlpan. John H. Kennard,
A. "W". Thompson, William O'Shaughnessy,
John J. Sheehan, J- 'VV. Riley, James McMahan,
F. E. Mahoney. T. J. McEride. Charles R.
Hej-den, Charles I* Healey.
Those selected by the committee were
Indorsed by the club, and their election
to-night at Julian avenue and Sixteenth
streets will be but a matter of form.
Thirty-Ninth. I>einocrats.
Saratoga Hall was filled last night with
members of the Bryan and Stevenson
Club of the Thirty-ninth Assembly Dis
trict. The club decided to parade on the
occasion of tlr? ratification meeting of
the Democrats, Saturday evening, Sep
tember 22. Resolutions were submitted
by S. Kohlman, requesting the executive
committee of the Hearst. Bryan ana
Stevenson Club movement to Inform the
club whether the organization was to be
composed only of Bryan and Stevenson
clubs organized by the County Committee.
The resolutions were unanimously adopt
ed. A committee composed of J. F. Ford
and John Shinklin was appointed to con
fer with a committee from the other
Democratic club In the district to devise
ways and means for carrying on the
campaign. On adjournment the club pro
ceeded in a body to Native Sons' Hall to
participate in the meeting of the rival
Democrats, who were being addressed by
Porter Ashe and others.
Porter Ashe Club Formed.
Permanent organization of the Porter
Ashe Democratic Central Club was effect
ed last night at Native Sons' Hall by
electing Hull McClaughry president. Five
vice presidents, two secretaries and a
treasurer were also elected. An executive
committee consisting of two members
from each of the Assembly districts com
prising the Fourth Congressional District,
and five at large, were elected. Speeches
made by F. J. Heney. T. E. Treacy and
F. J. Fitzsimmons- were greeted with pro
longed applause. The last speaker of the
evening. Porter Ashe, was greeted with
hearty cheers when he arose. His speech
â¢was Interrupted time and again by cheers
long and loud. At the close ' of his re
marks the enthusiasm displayed by his
friends fairly lifted the roof.

REAFFIRM UNBOUNDED DEVOTION TO REPUBLICANISM
Continued From Page Twe'lve.
MARTIN KELLY IS TRIUMPHANT
IN PERMANENT ORGANIZATION
OF REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
OAKLAND, Sept. 20.â Cross neglect on
the part of a freight train crew caused a
serious collision on the Southern Pacific
Railroad this afternoon at Haywards be
tween the Sacramento local passenger
train, due In San Francisco at 4:15 o'clock,
and a local freight. But for the nerve of
Engineer Morris Shean of the passenger
train, who remained at his post, the
wreck would have been disastrous to the
150 passengers. As it was. the shock was
sufficient to tumble them about In the
crowded coaches and to cause a panic for
a few minutes.
The primary cause of the head-on col
lision was the Inexcusable carelessness of
the freight train crew in leaving a switch
open on the main line track while the
freight was standing on a siding waiting
for the passenger train's arrival at Hay
wa rds.
The Sacramento train was composed of
engine 1402, four coaches, a baggage and
a mall car, in charge of Conductor Kil
patrick and Engineer Shean. It carried
passengers from Sacramento, Stockton.
Hanford, Mendota and Porterville. It was
due at Haywards at 3:06 p. rru, and was
on time. The freight train, in charge of
Conductor Jack Carey, with Brakemen
Scott. Barber and Short, had backed
down upon the siding near Hunt's Can
nery.
The lower switch toward Nu>Â« had bÂ«*n
opened to let the freight run In on thÂ»
siding until the passenger train passed.
Instead of closing thl3 switch it was left
thrown open. The passenger train came
booming along at thirty-five miles an hour
for Oakland pier. Engineer Shean had
given the station whistle and was Just
slowing: down when he struck thÂ© open
switch. The big. puffing engine of thÂ©
freight train loomed up in front of him
before he had time to move. With quick
action he threw the reverse lever ami
gave all steam back as hard as hl3 engine
would stanrl. But the collision was In
evitable. Shean did not have tlma to
prevent that.
The engines came together with a crash
and a shock that sent passengers flying
from their seats. ThÂ« pilots and fronts
of both locomotives were smashed Into
small bits, causing several thousand dol
lars* damage. There was a scurry-ins as
soon as the engine was brought to a
standstill to pee If any one was hurt. The
train crews were held for orders from
the division superintendent's office.
To clear the track of the crippled en
gines was the next task. An engine from
a Livermore local freight train was press
ed into serlvce to drag the disabled pas
senger train Into Oakland, and the Jour
ney was completed after considerable de
lay without further interruption from ob
structing freight trains.
Both Engines Wrecked, but Fortunately No
One Is Injured â Engineer Morris Shean
a Hero â Negligence the Cause*

CARS AT HAYWARDS
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
JUS Broadway. Sept. 20.
The Police ' Commissioners* executive
session hearing of the charges against
PoHrempn Thomas Pardee was resumed
this afternoon, two score witnesses again
appearing to await turns to enter tho
Mayor's private office, where the lnquisi
toriil m^etin^.s nre being held. x
The Commissioners held a very short
session this afternoon, assembling about
2 o'clock. Fred F. Howe was called be
fore them for cross-examination. Attor
ney L S. Church, who is Pardee's coun
sel, took Howe back to the date of his
birth and rak*Â»d him right merrily with a
questioning that would have racked a
much less nervous indiviuual than Mr.
Howe.
"Well. I guess they know as much
about me as I know nbout myself." said
Howe as he emerged from the room
aftÂ»r two hours of hard examination.
His sister. Mrs. A. D. Howe, followed,
and when the board rose at o o'clock her
cross-examination was stlil in progress.
The Commissioners are already weary
ing of the prolonged and detailed* minute
ness with which the investigation is bo
ing conducted. They decided this after
noon to s'.t to-morrow from 10:30 a. m.
,untll noon and tlif-n take a rest until
Monday, when they will resume the in
quiry.
The majority of the great number of
witnesses that have been subpenaed are
to give evidence merely as to the char
acter of the accusing Howes and the po
liceman. There is, as a matter of fact,
no direct evidence other than that of the
Howes and Pardee bearing upon the truth
or the falsity of the accusations. That
the investigation should have assumed
the proportions it did is due beyond any
question to the attempt of factions in the
Police Department and in City Hall poli
tics to gain a point or two that will be of
advantage In the coming municipal con
test of next spring. The supporters of
Fardee are bound that he shall not suffer
dismissal from the force, while the other
side are equally determined to see him
lose his star.
The political aspect of the trouble has
somewhat overshadowed the real issue, so
far as the Howes' charges are concerned.
Pardee's Accuser Is Kept
Busy Upon Record of
a Lifetime.

physician. The physician to'd him frank

that he had better go to Arizona. Jacob

Â¦'hange of climate did not benefit him.
He continued to oouprh and lose flesh at
an alarming rat?. A San Rafael doctor
told him that ho could secure relief by
going to Alameda. Jacobson followed his
advice and came to reside here. The
couching increased in violence, however,
and from weighing 2'X> pounds Jacobson
was reduced to k-sp than 100 pounds. The
unfortunate man. despairing of obtaining
relief, then prepared fnr the coming of

from irritation was instantaneous. Jacob

tho broken tooth showed It to be quite

about a quarter c.f an inch lone.

General Smith took the lead and held It
half the journey, with Maggie McKinney
a length and Athereine hopelessly in the
rear. The race looked safe for Smith until
nearing tho third turn. Then he went up
in the air and the first money could not
have been taken away from the black
mare with a club. She slowed up on the
homestretch to allow Athereine to save
his distance. The purse was divided as
follows: Maggie McKinney first. General

book odds were: General Smith 2 to 5,
Maggie McKinney 6 to 6 and Atherelne
3 to 1.
STOCKTON, Sept. 20.â The talent went
against It to-day when they put up their
hard money on Sea Spray, slated to win
in the first running event. The Up was
passed out among the faithful that "sure
thing dope had been throwed Into the
nag" and there was no question as to tho
result. Sea Spray lost, and the sports de
clare that Flynn pulled the horse and did
his work raw, but no formal charges were
preferred.
The day was bad, a fast wind clouding
the track and breaking; the horses at dif
ferent angles.

â¢
Lande & Gerber's Mount Ida won the
deciding course from P. M. Clarkson's
Headwater 1 ; a 2 to 1 favorite. Thi3 run
Â¦was as pretty an exhibition as one could
wish to see. Unfortunately for the hard
worked dogs, they were pitted against
the speediest kind of a hare, which gave
them a grueling course all over the lot."
iuount Ida took a slight lead at the slip
and maintained It to the farthest escape.
No change was noticeable in the position
of the dogs In the long run up the field,
nor was a turn made in the entire dis
tance. Then up and down the escape
fence and back to the slipper's box the
jack gave its black pursuers a hard
chase and kept the excited onlookers 'on
tiptoe.
Jennie Noyes, a young greyhound, beat
.l>.>. of Fashion, a 2 to 1 favorite, in the
rundown and showed some good qualities.
This was her second time out and after
having some experience she will probably
prove a good one. -
Flower of Gold beat Golden Gate In a
heavy scoring course, after one unde
cided, and the hare gave the winner a
chance to inspect nearly every foot of
the field.
Imperial and Thunderbolt ran In good
form and fooled the wise ones.
Good odds were offered against the
dozen short ends which upset calcula
tions. The stake throughout was a good
one.
The day's results, with Judge Andrew
Dean's official scores, follow:
The midweek stake of the Ingleslde
Association at San Mateo Park yesterday
furnished a good programme of coursing.

Long Courses Result â A Dozen

"The next order of business," declared
Bergerot, "Is the reading of the report of
Edmund Tauszky moved that the re
mainder of the majority report be adopt
ed. Ruef moved as an amendment that
the names of delegates In the Twenty
ninth, Thirty-third, Forty-second and
Forty-third districts aa they appeared on
the temporary rollcall be substituted In
the report. Bergerot ruled the amend
ment out of order, on the ground that
Ruefs proposition had been disposed of
In the rejection of the minority report.
Ruef contended that the minority report
included much more â the unseating of
three other delegations â but Bergerot
again refused him a hearing and refused
to allow a free expression of opinion on
the majority report, hurrying It to a vote
The Kelly-Crimmins delegates and the
Kelly-Crimmins heelers that had crowd
ed up along the aisles voted aye with a
roar, and Bergerot declared the majority
report of the committee on credentials
adopted.
On the rollcall on Hathorn's motion,
Martin Kelly again stood up in his place
and grandiloquently announced the vote
of the glorious Twenty-eighth solidly
against the motion. The vote was taken
rapidly and without waiting for a count
by the secretaryâ the "secretary by pro
fession" â Bergerot decided the motion
lost.
Bergerot, decidedly nettled, said that he
would not allow one member to monopo
lize the time of the convention and began
refusing to recognize Ruef, his chief tor
mentor. He claimed that Hathorn's mo
tion was before the house. Tauszky said
that there was danger of the convention
getting into a snarl over a very plain mat
ter, and he proceeded to explain It, but got
himself tied up in such a snarl that the
convention roared with laughter. Then
some one moved the previous question on
Hathorn's motion to substitute the mi
nority for the majority report, and,
though there had been no debate at all
Bergerot refused to recognize Ruef and
others and put the previous question
amid a storm of hisses that stung him
into a rage.
Tauszky'a motion, of course, prevailed,
and Bergerot, by this time thoroughly
rattled, was anxious to entertain a "mo
tion as a substitute for the whole." Ruef
pinned him down again with a point of
order that the motion to table waa again
to be voted upon. Somebody nudged
Guilfoyle and he withdrew the trouble
some motion.
had been much confusion, had been put
Then he allowed the situation to be made
more absurd by entertaining a motion
made by "Phonograph" Guilfoyle that the
minority reportâ not Hathorn's motion
be tabled. The motion was carried, and
Ruef immediately had the chairman
guessing by raising the point of order that
such action tabled the whole question of
the reports on credentials. Bergerot
sparred for wind by claiming that Guil
foyle's motion waa to table Hathorn's
motion, but the dullest Kelly booster
knew that he was wrong, and Edmund
Tauszky cams to his rescue with a motion
to reconsider the vote by which the re
port had been tabled.
Continued on Page Nine.
Diligent and perf=IÂ«tent efforts were
made by representative Republicans for
the privilege of speaking to questions con
cerr.irs the welfare of the party, but the
chairman paid no attention whatever to
their appeals. He put motions and de
clafi results to suit Bofs Ke31y. Atthe
cutft the chair refused to allow George
L. Center to Introduce a resolution. Dele
gates who sought to protest in a firm but
were in pviijence.
ThTe have been In can Frandsco many
examples of blind devotion to boss pro
grammes, but there never was a more
deplorable spectacle of subserviency to
boss dictation than was exhibited last
right by the chairman of the Republican
Martin Kelly occupied his original placo
on the floor of the convention and dub
announced the solid boss vote of his dis
trict delegation, but did not give his fol
lowers another elaborate oratorical treat.
There was no occasion, however, for. ral
lying the boss elements, as Bergerot, v/ho
could be aptly styled Martin Kelly Ber
gerot, took care of boss interests on th^
platform. As Bergerot was put in nom
ination by Kelly, was chosen temporary
chairman by Kellv, was continued- as per
manent chairman by Kelly and followed
the Kelly programme from start to finish
he is justly entitled to the appellation of
Martin Kelly Bergerot. He lacks Kelly's
ability, however, as an orator and pre
siding officer, as he Is easily rnuddle'd and
rattled. He was so rank and raw In hla
taken and entertain a motion to recon
sider.
Bergerot's decision having been sus
tained, the chairman, i without permitting
any debate, put the motion made by C.
W. Greene, that all delegates from dis
tricts where there . were ' no ]. contests be
declared seated. Ruef contended. that the
minority report must be Â¦Â¦ acted upon first,
but- Bergerot decided that the majority
report must be passed upon first. . This
decision was so manifestly contrary, to
all usare-thar it was received with a
storm of hisses. The motion was put and
declared carried.
Bergerot then made the astounding
statement that Hathorn's. motion, which
he Interpreted I to be the I substitution â¢ of
the minority report for the portion of. the
majority report not yet acted upon, waa
before the convention. This in face of the
fact, that Hathorn ' had â¢ made his motion
before, Greene's motion, over which there
THAT MINORITY REPORT.
This minority also protests against the use
jof proxies In the convention as recommended
by the majority of this committee. The use of
proxies in municipal conventions is unusual
and has to our knowledge never heretofore been
countenanced in local conventions of the Re
publican party In San Francisco, and our con
stituents in electing us certainly contemplated
our personal attendance, and our duty to. the
Republican party demands that we should per
sonally fulfill our trust.
We therefore recommend- that no proxies be
allowed in this convention.
RALPH' L. HATHORN,
E. C. AMEDEB.
Hathorn moved that the minority report
be substituted for the majority report.
Ruef moved that the whole matter be
referred back to the committee with In
structions to report the temporary roll
call aa the true rollcall. Bergerot ruled
the motion out of order, and Ruef ap
pealed and demanded a rollcall.
Bergerot asked Secretary Mahoney to
call the roll. Dr. Morris, the other secre
tary, tried to call the roll, but Bergerot
declared that no one but Mahoney, the
"secretary by profession," Bhould call It.
George Boyne demanded fair play and
"Long John" Wllkins suppressed him.
Thomas K. Kase demanded to know
what roll was to be called.. Bergerot said
the temporary .roll would be followed.
The votes of the Twenty-eighth. District
were cast proudly by Martin Kelly in fa
vor of Bergerot's decision. "Phonograph"
Guilfoyle bobbed up and = objected to the
calling of the rollof the Twenty-ninth or
other districts where there were contests.
Bergerot ruled that the point was well
taken, and the Twenty-ninth was passed.
Â¦When the Thirty-first was- reached Ruef
demanded that It be passed also, as a con
test had been filed in that district by
him, as well as in the Thirty-seventh and
Forty-fifth District. , Berge rot ignored his
point, and amid great confusion the Thir
ty-first District was called.
Proceeding under Bergerot's arbitrary
ruling, the roll call ; was completed. 'and
Secretary Mahonev announced the vote
as 155 nyes to 52 noes. The Herrln-Kelly-
Crimmlns crowd had won decisively, and
the vote showed conclusively that with
Bergerot ready to trample under foot any
parliamentary usage that -threatened the
supremacy of his faction there could be
no hope of success for the Bouvler-Ruef
men. ...
To the Temporary Chairman and to the Re
publican Local. Judicial and Legislative Con
ventions â Gentlemen: The undersigned, a mi
nority of your committee on credentials, re
spectfully report that the delegates whoee
names are printed upon the accompanying tem
porary roll of the convention are, and each ot
them respectively Is. entitled to a seat In the
ctnventlun from their respective Assembly dis
tricts, except that in the Thirty-first Assembly
District we find that the following-named dele
gates should of right be seated in place of those
on said roll: T. P. Baunders, D. Brosnan. J.
J, Mlley, John Mullaney, T. J. S. Kuce, E.
Dinning. H. WolnnRer. L. A. Taylor, J. Martin,
L. Uerger, W. J. Mlskell.
In the Forty-fifth District the following;
should be selected in place of those on said
roll: George Klngsbury, Joseph Barbetta, Jo
seph Spohn. W. A. Richardson, W. R. Noonan,
R. H. Graham, James Duffy, Joseph Spiegel.
In the Thirty-seventh District the following
should be seated in place of those on said roll:
H. P. Umbsen, Edgar Drlggs, M. M. Stern, E.
L. Cook, John Tuttle, John C. Cullen, George
D. Clark, D. C. n. McCarthy, John J. Castlen,
Edward L- Christln, Charles Alpers, William
Clark. William J. Jones, W. H. Barrows. T.
L. Henderson. Carl U. Koster. Dr. J. W. Ham
ilton, w. J. Ramsay, Philip Rogers.
And the minority of your committee respect
fully recommends that said delegates as herein
r.amed be placed on the roll of said convention
and be declared the members thereof.
Hathorn got the floor to read a minority
report, as follows:
The chairman called for the report of
the committee on : credentials, and re
fused to entertain a resolution, which
George L. Center desired to present.
Chairman Green of the committee on cre
dentials read the report agreed upon the
night before. Beating the Kelly-Crlmmins
delegates in the Twenty-ninth and Forty
second districts, giving the contesting
Kelly-Crimmins delegates -half a vote in
the Thirty-third -and Forty-third districts,
and leaving the delegates aa per tempo
rary rollcall in the Fortieth and Forty
fourth districts. Chairman Green con
cluded by moving .that In districts where
there were no contests the delegates be
declared seated.
Abe Ruef made the point of order that
the motion .was out or order, and R. F.

Both Majority and Minority Strive
REPORT OF CREDENTIALS.
The Kelly-Crimmins delegations showed
many new faces, men with proxies taking
the place of some of the "lame ducks.
Among these W. S. Barnea was conspic
uous, he having a proxy in the Twenty
eighth District.
Martin Kelly came in just as the con
vention was called to order and marched
to the front where the Twenty-eighth Dis
trict, "elected unanimously by the peo
ple," sat. He was received with cheers
by his henchmen.
Regardless of the Intention to keep th$
floor cleared of all but delegates, outsid
ers flocked In and crowded the aisles at
the sides of the sections of seats. The
gallery was black with spectators.
Temporary Chairman Bergerot called
the convention to order at 8:30 o'clbck and
appointed Michael Drlscoll, John S. Wll
kins, Joseph Toot, Maury Bushway and
J, Waller Jr. as sergeants-at-arms.
"Gentlemen of the convention," said
Chairman Bergerot, "I have every reason
to believe that we meet here in better
spirit than that which characterized our
first session. I am here to perform my
duty and will do it with a promptness
that will surprise those who come here
expecting to see any behavior hut the
most decorous. I shall wield the gavel
with perfect fairness, In absolute com
pliance with parliamentary usage. I do
not anticipate any disturbance, and I sin
cerely hope none of you will forget your
selves." ,
Chairman Bergerot asked all on the
floor who were not delegates to retire to
the rear of the hall or to the gallery, and
Instructed the chairman of delegations to
report any among their delegations who
were not delegates.
The doors of the hall were opened at
7:r>0 o'clock and the delegates filled the
hall rapidly. Contesting Kelly-Crimmins
delegates whope names were not on the
temporary rollcall crowded forward and
forced themselves in among the delegates
entitled to the seats until the convention
should decide otherwise. The Kelly-
Crimmins delegates in the Forty-second
and Forty-third districts^made themselves
particularly obnoxious/ crowding their
chairs in between the rows regularly
placed. Only the forbearance of the op
posing delegates prevented physical en
counters.

ship of A. Ruef made a sorry spectacle
of the presiding agent of the bosses, plac

not conceal the fact that he had accepted
the Kelly programme . before he was
chosen to preside.
The convention will meet Monday night
to nominate Superior Judges and justices
of the Peace. It is expected that persons
desiring to be placed on the ticket will

THE associated botsr*, under the
leadership cf Martin Kelly, per
manently organized the Republi
can Municipal Nominating Con
vection at B'nai B'riih Hall last
r.lpht. P. A. Bergerot. who was originally
placed in nomination for temj>orary chair
mar, by Kelly, was retained as the per
manent presiding officer.
In calling: the convention to order Ber
pÂ»>rot promised to render impartial
rulings, but at every point h^ decided in
favor of thf bo5s pieman:. In truth ne
not only ipcorpd but insulted the minor
ity. IlaJfh 1~ Hat hoi n, in presenting a
minority report from .he committee on
credentials, made a preliminary remark
that two members tlissented from the ma
jority report. Chairman Bergerot. in the
presence of the conventioa. flatly contra
dicted Mr. Hathorn. asserting that there
was only one dissenting; member of thÂ«*
romnittw. Mr. Hathorn. in a sclf-pos
cpss^d and dignified manner, said to the
jf^pates that he coulO not engage in a
rontrovrrsy with the chair, but would
content himself with the simple state
ment that two members had signed the
minority report and *hat their signature?
\igcroiiS manner were menaced by bo&s
appointcd serer-ants at arms. The chair
threatened to use police power to sup
press the i-rctestitiu minority. Men who
sought to Bpeak were rndeavoring to ex
press the sentiments of decent Repub
licans of San Francisco. They wanted
to cave the party from shame and dis
grace, but they were threatened with ex
pulsfon from the hall if they persisted in
th< ir efforts.
True to the pledge adopted at the
anti-boss conference in Shiels Hall, Wed
aesday evening las-t, the ignored and in
sulted representatives of clean , politics
an<i good government did not leave the
convention in a body, yet scores of self
resiiecling delegates and old time honored
R< publicans, whose loyalty to the -prin
dples of the party cannot be questioned,
left the hall with a determination not to
riturn.
In ha?te to execute the programme of
Boss Kelly the chairman made one griev
ous blunder. He put the motion to lay
the minority report of the committee on
credentials on the table and 't was car
ried. Then A. Ruef raised the point of
order that the whole subject matter of
credentials had been placed on the table.
In order to extricate the !>jss e-lement
from a silly predicament the chair was
compelled to recognize the point as weii

As forecasted In The Call. Judge Ca
banlss yesterday Instructed the Jury in
the case of Louis Roblnette. charged with
violating the ordinance against selling
pools, to return a verdict of acquittal, as
the evidence was not sufficient to consti
tute the offense charged In the complaint.
The Jury took ten minutes to bring In
the verdict of acquittal as Instructed by
the Judge, and the foreman said he
thoutrht the $3 should be refunded to the
ofllcer. The Judge thought so too, but
Roblnette and his attorney only smiled.
The police are of the opinion that they
have received a- setback, as according to
the Judge's decision poolsellers can- go
ahead and sell pools and by simply keep
ine a memorandum of each bet instead
of issuing a. ticket will not violate the
law. â¢''Â¦".--
